<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AGRICULTURE and GARDENING, though of &s;uch
great utility in producing the nutriment of mankind,
continue to be only Arts, con&s;i&s;ting of numerous
detached facts and vague opinions, without a true
theory to connect them, or to appreciate their ana|logy;
at a time when many parts of knowledge of
much inferior con&s;equence have been nicely arrang|ed,
and dige&s;ted into Sciences.</P>
<P>Our imperfect acquaintance with the phy&s;iology
and economy of vegetation is the principal cau&s;e of
the great immaturity of our knowledge of Agricul|ture,
and Gardening. I &s;hall therefore fir&s;t attempt
a theory of vegetation, deduced principally from the
experiments of Hales, Grew, Malpighi, Bonnet, Du
Hamel, Buffon, Spallanzani, Prie&s;tley, and the Phi|lo&s;ophers
of the Linnaean School, with a few ob&s;er|vations
and opinions of my own; &s;ome of which have
in part already appeared in Zoonomia, and in the
notes to the Botanic Garden, but are here corrected
and enlarged. To the former of which works I
hope this may be e&s;teemed a &s;upplement, as it is pro|perly
a continuation of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="6">
My inducement to commence this work, after it
was &s;ugge&s;ted to me by the letters of Sir John Sin|clair,
was a belief, that the experiments and ob&s;er|vations
already made on the growth of plants, with
the modern improvements in chemi&s;try, were &s;uffi|ciently
numerous and accurate for the e&s;tabli&s;hment
of a true theory of vegetation; &s;o much wanted to
connect the various facts in the memory, to appre|ciate
their value, and to compare them with each
other; and finally to direct the pro&s;ecution of future
experiments to u&s;eful purpo&s;es.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE BUDS OF VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<Q>1. Vegetables are inferior animals. A bud torn from a tree will
grow; vines and hawthorns &s;o planted. Many kinds of fruit
ingrafted on one tree. 2. The bark and branches of hollow
trees remain alive. Caudex of herbaceous plants. Caudex of
buds. 3. Which de&s;cending, form a new bark over the old one.
The&s;e bark ve&s;&s;els occa&s;ionally ino&s;culate. Upper lip of wounds
of the bark grows downwards. 4. Flower-buds are indivi|dual
beings; do not &s;o certainly grow by inoculation as leaf-buds;
are biennial plants like leaf-buds, but die in autumn without en|larging
the &s;ize of the tree by their progeny. 5. In what vege|tables
differ from animals; they have not mu&s;cles of locomotion;
nor organs of dige&s;tion. 6. In what they re&s;emble animals.
They have ab&s;orbent, umbilical, placental, and pulmonary ve&s;|&s;els,
arteries, glands, organs of reproduction, with mu&s;cles,
nerves, and brain. 7. Progre&s;s of a young bud, and of a &s;eed.
The plumula, radicle, and caudex of a bud. 8. Buds and &s;eeds
are biennial beings. How they differ. The di&s;union of the pith
di&s;tingui&s;hes buds from each other, and thus evinces their indi|viduality.</Q>
<P>1. WE have &s;o accu&s;tomed our&s;elves to con&s;ider life and ir|ritability
to be a&s;&s;ociated with palpable warmth and vi&s;ible motion,
that we find a renitency in our&s;elves to a&s;cribe them to the com|paratively
cold and motionle&s;s fibres of plants. But to rea&s;on
<PB N="2" REF="8">
rightly on many vegetable phenomena we &s;hall find it nece&s;&s;ary
fir&s;t to &s;hew, that vegetables are in reality an inferior order of
animals.</P>
<P>If a bud be torn from the branch of a tree, or cut out and
planted in the earth with a gla&s;s cup inverted over it, to pre|vent
the exhalation from being at fir&s;t greater than its power of
ab&s;orption; or if it be in&s;erted into the bark of another tree, it
will grow, and become a plant in every re&s;pect like its parent.
This evinces that every bud of a tree is an individual vegetable
being; and that a tree therefore is a family or &s;warm of indi|vidual
plants, like the polypus, with its young growing out of
its fides, or like the branching cells of the coral-in&s;ect.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent mo&s;t approved method of propagating vines in
hot-hou&s;es con&s;i&s;ts in cutting off a &s;ingle eye of a vine-&s;talk with
about an inch of the &s;tem above the eye, and two or three inches
below it; and &s;etting this a&s;lant in the bark-bed with the eye
about an inch or le&s;s beneath the &s;urface, pointing upwards; and
I have &s;een a quick&s;et or hawthorn hedge, cretaegus, propagated
in the &s;ame manner by planting twigs in the ground with one bud
only above the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Mr. Barns in a treati&s;e on Propagating Fruit-trees (1759, Bald|win,
London) a&s;&s;erts, that he cut a branch into as many pieces,
as there were buds or leaves upon it; and wiping the two
wounded ends dry, he quickly applied to each a cement pre|viou&s;ly
warmed, which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of pitch, and planted them
in the earth with unfailing &s;ucce&s;s. The u&s;e of this cement I
&s;u&s;pect to con&s;i&s;t in its preventing the bud from bleeding to death,
though the author a&s;cribes it to its anti&s;eptic quality. And
la&s;tly, in the inoculation and ingrafting of fruit-trees, five or &s;ix
different kinds of pears are frequently &s;een on the branches of
one tree, which could not then properly be termed an individual
being.</P>
<P>2. When old oaks, or willows, lo&s;e by decay almo&s;t all their
&s;olid internal wood, it frequently happens, that a part of the
&s;hell of the &s;tem continues to flouri&s;h with a few healthy
branches. Whence it appears, that no part of the tree is alive
but the buds, and the bark, and the root fibres; that the bark
is only an intertexture of the caudexes of the numerous buds,
<PB N="3" REF="9">
as they pa&s;s down to &s;hoot their radicles into the earth; and
that the &s;olid timber of a tree cea&s;es to be alive; and is then
only of &s;ervice to &s;upport the numerous family of buds in the air
above the herbaceous vegetables in their vicinity.</P>
<P>A bud of a tree therefore, like a vegetable ari&s;ing from a
&s;eed, con&s;i&s;ts of three parts; the plumula or leaf, the radicle or
root-fibres, and the part which joins the&s;e two together; which
is called the caudex by Linneus when applied to intire plants;
and may, therefore, be termed caudex gemmae when applied
to buds.</P>
<P>In herbaceous plants the caudex is generally a broad flat cir|cular
plate, from which the leaf-&s;tem a&s;cends into the air, and
the radicles or root-fibres de&s;cend into the earth. Thus the
caudex of a plant of wheat lies between the &s;tem and the ra|dicles,
at the ba&s;is of the lowermo&s;t leaf, and occa&s;ionally pro|duces
new &s;tems and new radicles from its &s;ides. Thus the
caudex of the tulip lies beneath the principal bulb, and gene|rates
new &s;maller bulbs in the bo&s;om of each bulb-leaf, be&s;ides
one principal or central bulb; the caudex of orchis, and of
&s;ome ranunculu&s;es, lies above their bulbous roots; whereas the
caudexes of the buds of trees con&s;titute the longitudinal filaments
of the bark, reaching from the plumula or apex of the bud on
the branch to the ba&s;e of it, or its root-fibres beneath the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Nor is this elongation of the caudexes of the buds of trees
unanalogous to what happens to &s;ome herbaceous plants, as in
wheat; when the grain is buried two or three inches beneath the
&s;oil, an elongation of the caudex occurs almo&s;t up to the &s;urface,
where another &s;et of fibrous roots are protruded, and the up-right
&s;tem commences. The &s;ame happens to tulip-roots when
planted too deep in the earth, as I have witne&s;&s;ed, and I &s;up|po&s;e
to tho&s;e of many other vegetables.</P>
<P>This caudex of the buds of trees not only de&s;cends as above
de&s;cribed, but al&s;o a&s;cends from each bud to that above it; as on
the long &s;hoots of vines, willows, and briars; in this re&s;pect re|&s;embling
the wires of &s;trawberries and other creeping plants.
Thus the caudex of perennial herbaceous plants con&s;i&s;ts of a
broad plate, buried beneath the &s;oil to protect it from the fro&s;t;
while the caudex of buds of trees con&s;i&s;ts of a long va&s;cular cord
<PB N="4" REF="10">
extending from the bud on the branch to the radicle beneath the
earth, and endures the winter fro&s;ts without injury.</P>
<P>3. The&s;e buds are properly biennial plants, as they are gene|rated
in one &s;ummer, and in the next either produce &s;eeds and
die, or produce other buds, who&s;e caudexes form a new bark
over the former one, that of the la&s;t year fir&s;t becoming a &s;ofter
or more porous wood, called alburnum, or &s;ap-wood, and gra|dually
hardening into &s;olid timber, which cea&s;es to po&s;&s;e&s;s vege|table
life.</P>
<P>The&s;e long caudexes of the individual buds of trees, which
con&s;titute their bark, are well &s;een in the cloth made from the
mulberry-bark brought from Otaheite. On in&s;pecting this cloth
the long fibres are &s;een in &s;ome places to adhere, where it is pro|bable
they occasionally ino&s;culate, like &s;ome of the ve&s;&s;els in ani|mal
bodies; becau&s;e when &s;ome buds are cut off, the neighbour|ing
ones flouri&s;h with greater vigour, being &s;upplied with more
of the nutritious juices.</P>
<P>This informs us why the upper lip of an horizontal wound
made in the bark of a tree grows downwards with &s;o much
greater expedition than the under one grows upwards to meet it;
as the de&s;cending caudexes of the individual buds are &s;upplied
directly with nutriment from the vegetable arteries after the oxy|genation
of the blood in their leaves; whereas the under lip of the
wound is nouri&s;hed only by the lateral or ino&s;culating ve&s;&s;els,
which &s;upplies us with another argument again&s;t the individuality
of trees, and in favour of that of buds.</P>
<P>4. The buds producing flowers are each an individual being
as well as the leaf-buds above de&s;cribed, though they are pro|bably
not &s;o ea&s;ily capable of tran&s;plantation into the bark of
other trees by inoculation; as, I believe, it is from the mi&s;take
of the gardeners in choo&s;ing flower-buds in&s;tead of leaf-buds to
inoculate with, that &s;o many buds die in this mode of propaga|tion.
Nor does the exi&s;tence of many male and female parts
in one flower de&s;troy its individuality any more than the number
of paps of a &s;ow or bitch, or the number of their cotyledons,
each of which during ge&s;tation belongs to a &s;eparate fetus.</P>
<P>The flower-buds as well as the leaf-buds are properly biennial
plants, as they are produced in the &s;ummer of one year, and
<PB N="5" REF="11">
peri&s;h in the autumn of the next; but as the new buds gene|rated
by leaf-buds continue to adhere to the parent, they are
furni&s;hed with their numerous caudexes, which form a new bark
over the old one, whereas the flower-buds generate &s;eeds, which
when mature fall upon the ground, and thus they die in the au|tumn
without increa&s;ing the &s;ize of the parent-tree by the adhe|&s;ion
of their progeny like the leaf-buds.</P>
<P>5. The&s;e buds of plants, which are each an individual vege|table
being, in many circum&s;tances re&s;emble individual animals;
but as animal bodies are detached from the earth, and move from
place to place in &s;earch of food, and take that food at con&s;ider|able
intervals of time, and prepare it for their nouri&s;hment within
their own bodies, after it is taken; it is evident, that they mu&s;t
require many organs and powers, which are not nece&s;&s;ary to a
&s;tationary bud. As vegetables are immoveably fixed to the &s;oil,
from whence they draw their aliment ready prepared, and this
uniformly, and not at returning intervals; it follows, that in ex|amining
their anatomy we are not to look for mu&s;cles of loco|motion,
as legs and arms; nor for organs to receive and prepare
their aliment as a mouth, throat, &s;tomach, and bowels, by which
contrivances animals are enabled to live many hours without new
&s;upplies of food from without.</P>
<P>6. The parts, which we may expect to find in the anatomy
of vegetables, which corre&s;pond to tho&s;e in the animal economy,
are fir&s;t a three-fold &s;y&s;tem of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, one branch of
which is de&s;igned to imbibe the nutritious moi&s;ture of the earth,
as the lacteals imbibe the chyle from the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines
of animals; another to imbibe the water of the atmo&s;phere,
opening its mouths on the cuticle of the leaves and branches,
like the cutaneous lymphatic ve&s;&s;els of animals; and a third to
imbibe the &s;ecreted fluids from the internal cavities of the vege|table
&s;y&s;tem, like the cellular lymphatics of animals.</P>
<P>Secondly, in the vegetable fetus, as in feeds or buds, another
&s;y&s;tem of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els is to be expected, which may be termed
umbilical ve&s;&s;els, as de&s;cribed in Sect. III. of this work, which
&s;upply nutriment to the new bud or &s;eed, &s;imilar to that of the
albumen of the egg, or the liquor amnii of the uterus; and
al&s;o another &s;y&s;tem of arterial ve&s;&s;els, which may be termed pla|cental
ones, corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e of the animal fetus in the
<PB N="6" REF="12">
egg or in the womb, which &s;upply the blood of the embryon with
due oxygenation before its nativity.</P>
<P>Thirdly, a pulmonary &s;y&s;tem correspondent to the lungs of
aerial animals, or to the gills of aquatic ones, by which the fluid
ab&s;orbed by the lacteals and lymphatics may be expo&s;ed to the
influence of the air. This is done by the leaves of plants, or the
petals of flowers; tho&s;e in the air re&s;embling lungs, and tho&s;e
in the water re&s;embling gills.</P>
<P>Fourthly, an arterial &s;y&s;tem to convey the fluid thus elaborated
to the various glands of the vegetable for the purpo&s;es of its
growth, nutrition, and &s;ecretions; and a &s;y&s;tem of veins to bring
back a part of the blood not thus expended.</P>
<P>Fifthly, the various glands which &s;eparate from the vegetable
blood the honey, wax, gum, re&s;in, &s;tarch, &s;ugar, e&s;&s;ential oil,
and other &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>Sixthly, the organs adapted to the lateral or viviparous gene|ration
of plants by buds, or to their &s;exual or oviparous propaga|tion
by &s;eeds.</P>
<P>Seventhly, longitudinal mu&s;cles to turn their leaves to the
light, and to expand or clo&s;e their petals or their calyxes; and
va&s;cular mu&s;cles to perform the ab&s;orption and circulation of
their fluids, with their attendant nerves, and a brain, or common
&s;en&s;orium, belonging to each individual &s;eed or bud; to each
of which we &s;hall appropriate an explanatory &s;ection.</P>
<P>7. An embryon bud, therefore whether it be a leaf-bud or a
flower-bud, is the viviparous offspring of an adult leaf-bud, and
is as individual as a &s;eed, which is its oviparous offspring. It
con&s;i&s;ts, fir&s;t, of a central organization or caudex like the cor|culum
of a &s;eed, which contains the rudiments of arteries, veins,
ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els and glands, with an internal pith or brain.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is furni&s;hed with a &s;y&s;tem of umbilical ve&s;&s;els,
which are in&s;erted into the alburnum or &s;ap-wood of the tree,
or form a part of it, and de&s;cending into the earth &s;upply it in
the early &s;pring with its fir&s;t nutrition, like the &s;eminal roots, &s;o
called, which pa&s;s from the corculum of the &s;eed, and are &s;pread
on the cotyledons, as &s;een in the garden bean, repre&s;ented in
Plate I. Fig. 1. which is taken from Dr. Grew's Anatomy of
Plants.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13">
Thirdly, this umbilical &s;y&s;tem probably contains al&s;o what
may be termed a placental artery, terminating on the coats of the
lateral air-ve&s;&s;els, which penetrate the bark of trees horizontally,
for the purpo&s;e of oxygenating the blood of the vegetable fetus,
like tho&s;e di&s;tributed from the umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the chick on
the air-bag at the broad end of the egg. See Sect. II. 4. and
III. 1&mdash;4.</P>
<P>Fourthly, it contains the rudiments of organs adapted to la|teral
generation or the production of new buds; or to &s;exual pro|pagation,
and the con&s;equent production of &s;eeds.</P>
<P>In the early &s;pring the umbilical, ve&s;&s;els &s;upply the embryon
buds of trees with &s;ap-juice, which is then &s;een to ex&s;ude from
wounds of the alburnum, as in the vine, vitis; the birch, betula;
and the maple, acer; which I &s;uppo&s;e to become oxygenated in
the circulation of the vegetable fetus by the horizontal air-ve&s;&s;els
of the bark.</P>
<P>As the &s;ea&s;on advances, the leaf-bud puts forth a plumula,
like a &s;eed, which &s;timulated by the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere
ri&s;es upwards into leaves to acquire its adapted pabulum, which
leaves con&s;titute its lungs; it al&s;o protrudes from its long caudex,
which forms the new bark over the old one, a radicle, which
&s;timulated by moi&s;ture pa&s;&s;es downwards, and de&s;cends into the
earth to acquire its adapted pabulum; and it thus becomes an
adult vegetable being with the power of producing new buds.</P>
<P>The flower-bud under &s;imilar circum&s;tances puts forth its
bractes, or floral leaves, which &s;erve the office of lungs to the
pericarp and calyx; and expands its petals, which &s;erve the of|fice
of lungs to the anthers, and &s;tigmas, which are the &s;exual
organs of reproduction, and which die and fall off, when the
&s;eed is impregnated; and thus, like the leaf-bud, it becomes an
adult vegetable being with the power of producing &s;eeds.</P>
<P>8. As the flower-bud produces many &s;eeds during the &s;ummer,
&s;o the leaf-bud produces many budlets during the &s;ummer, as may
be &s;een in the long &s;hoots of the vine and willow, vitis et &s;alix.
In this climate both the buds and &s;eeds are properly biennial ve|getables;
that is, they are produced in one &s;ummer and peri&s;h in
the next. But the &s;eed differs from the bud in this circum&s;tance,
that it drops on the earth, and is thus &s;eparated from its dead
<PB N="8" REF="14">
parent in the autumn; whereas the bud continues to adhere to
its dead parent, and grows over it as it advances.</P>
<P>Now as the internal pith of a bud appears to contain or pro|duce
the living principle, like the brain and medulla oblongata,
or &s;pinal marrow of animals, we have from hence a certain cri|terion
to di&s;tingui&s;h one bud from another, or the parent bud from
the numerous budlets, which are its offspring, as <HI>there is no com|munication
of the internal pith between them.</HI></P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation was made by &s;litting the young branches of
hor&s;e-che&s;nut, ae&s;culus hippoca&s;tanum; of a&s;h, fraxinus; of
willow, &s;alix; and of elder, &s;ambucus nigra; and I plainly di&s;|cerned
that there exi&s;ted no communication of pith between the
lateral budlets and their parent &s;hoots, or between the central
larger budlet at the &s;ummit of the branch, and its parent &s;hoot.
This al&s;o afforded me one rea&s;on to conclude that the different
joints of wheat, triticum, of &s;outhi&s;tle, &s;onchus, and of tea&s;el,
dyp&s;acus, are different buds growing on each other, tho&s;e at the
&s;ummit only producing &s;eeds; becau&s;e there is a divi&s;ion which
&s;eparates the pith contained in each joint of their hollow &s;tems, as
is further explained in Sect. IX. 2. 4. and 3. 1. and which per|fectly
evinces the individuality of buds.</P>

are vi&s;ibly full of &s;ap-juice in a vine-&s;talk. Vegetable ve&s;&s;els
have rigid &s;ides, which do not collap&s;e, and hence become full of
air when cut; not &s;o in animal ve&s;&s;els. 4. Some horizontal
ve&s;&s;els in trees are truly air-ve&s;&s;els for the embryon bud, like, the
air in the broad end of the egg. 5. Ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els con&s;i&s;t of
long cylinders; air will pa&s;s through them either way in the dead
vegetable; are not re&s;piratory organs, as they exi&s;t in the roots of
trees. May receive air di&s;&s;olved in water. 6. Ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els
act either direct or retrogade. A forked branch in water. An
inverted tree. A &s;u&s;pended tree. So in the operation of an
emetic, and in ruminating cows. 7. They con&s;i&s;t of a &s;piral
line without valves; and by its vermicular contraction forcibly
carry on their contained fluids either way. 8. Tho&s;e of the root
act occa&s;ionally in winter; but vines in hot-hou&s;es mu&s;t have
their roots guarded from fro&s;t in &s;pring. Accumulated ice de&s;troys
trees in &s;pring. 9. They &s;ometimes ab&s;orb poi&s;onous fluids, as
&s;pirit of wine, &s;olution of ar&s;enic, vitriolic acid; roots &s;aid to
creep a&s;ide from bad &s;oil erroneous. 10. Ab&s;orbents of trees like
the receptacle of chyle.</Q>
<P>1. THE exi&s;tence of that branch of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of
vegetables, which re&s;embles the lacteals of animal bodies, and
imbibes their nutriment from the moi&s;t earth, is evinced by their
growth, &s;o long as moi&s;ture is applied to their roots, and their
quickly withering when it is withdrawn.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16">
Be&s;ides the&s;e ab&s;orbents in the roots of plants there are others,
which open their mouths on the external &s;urfaces of the bark and
leaves to ab&s;orb the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere, re&s;embling the
cutaneous lymphatics of animal bodies; the exi&s;tence of the&s;e
is &s;hewn, becau&s;e a leaf plucked off and laid with its under &s;ide
on water will not wither &s;o &s;oon as if left in the dry air. The
&s;ame if the bark alone of a branch, which is &s;eparated from a
tree, be kept moi&s;t with water.</P>
<P>A third branch of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els opens its mouths on the
internal &s;urfaces of the cells and cavities of the vegetable &s;y&s;tem
to ab&s;orb the &s;ecreted fluids, after they have performed their
adapted offices, &s;imilar to the cellular lymphatics of animal bo|dies,
as may be &s;hewn by moi&s;tening the alburnum or &s;ap-wood,
and the internal &s;urface of the bark of a branch detached from a
tree, which will not then &s;o &s;oon wither as if left in the dry air
unmoi&s;tened.</P>
<P>Another means of demon&s;trating the ab&s;orbent powers of the
parts of vegetables is by in&s;erting them into gla&s;s tubes, or into
tall narrow ve&s;&s;els filled with water, and ob&s;erving how much&punc;
more rapidly the &s;urface of the water &s;ub&s;ides than in &s;imilar ve&s;|&s;els
by evaporation alone.</P>
<P>2. By the following experiment the&s;e vegetable ab&s;orbent ve&s;|&s;els
were made agreeably vi&s;ible by a common magnifying gla&s;s,
I placed in the &s;ummer of 1781 &s;ome twigs of a fig-tree with
leaves on them, about an inch deep in a decoction of madder
(Rubia tinct), and others in a decoction of logwood (haema|toxylum
campechen&s;e), along with &s;ome &s;prigs cut off from a
plant of picris. The&s;e plants were cho&s;en becau&s;e their blood is
white. After &s;ome hours, and on the next day, on taking out
either of the&s;e, and cutting off from its bottom about an eighth
of an inch of the &s;talk, an internal circle of red points appeared,
which I believed to be the ends of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els coloured red
with the decoction, and which probably exi&s;ted in the newly
formed alburnum, or &s;ap-wood, while an external ring of arte|ries
was &s;een to bleed out ha&s;tily a milky juice, and at once
evinced both the ab&s;orbent and arterial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Many &s;imilar experiments were made by M. Bonnet, by
placing parts of the &s;tem or roots of various vegetables, as$of
<PB N="11" REF="17">
kidney-beans, peach-tree, and elder, in dilute ink; in all the&s;e
the ve&s;&s;els of the bark were uncoloured, and tho&s;e of the pith;
but tho&s;e beneath the bark, which he terms&punc; woody, were co|loured
black, which I &s;uppo&s;e to have been the circle of ab&s;or|bent
ve&s;&s;els above mentioned. U&s;age de Feuilles, Plate XXIX.</P>
<P>3. The&s;e ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els have been called bronchia by Mal|pighi
and Grew, and &s;ome other philo&s;ophers, and erroneou&s;ly
thought to be air-ve&s;&s;els; in the &s;ame manner as the arteries of
the human body were &s;uppo&s;ed to convey air by the antients, till
the great Harvey by more exact experiments and ju&s;ter rea&s;oning
evinced, that they were blood-ve&s;&s;els. This opinion has been
&s;o far credited becau&s;e air is &s;een to i&s;&s;ue from wood, whether it
be green or dry, if it be covered with water, and placed in the
exhau&s;ted receiver of an air-pump; and the&s;e ve&s;&s;els have there|fore
been &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute a vegetable re&s;piratory organ;
but it will be &s;hewn hereafter, that the leaves of plants are their
genuine lungs, and that the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els and arteries become
accidentally filled with air in the dead parts of vegetables.</P>
<P>For as the ve&s;&s;els of vegetables are very minute, and have
rigid coats, their &s;ides do not collap&s;e when they are cut or
broken, as their juices flow out or exhale; they mu&s;t therefore
receive air into them. This may be readily &s;een by in&s;pecting
with a common lens the end of a vine-&s;talk two or three years
old, when cut off horizontally. At fir&s;t the ve&s;&s;els, which are
&s;een between the partitions radiated from the center, appear full
of juice; but in a minute or le&s;s this juice either pa&s;&s;es on,
or exhales; and the ve&s;&s;els appear empty, that is filled with air.
This experiment I have twenty times repeated with uniform &s;uc|ce&s;s,
and it is &s;o ea&s;ily made by ha&s;tily applying a common lens
after the divi&s;ion of a vine-&s;talk, that I think there can be no
error in it; and it is wonderful that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which are
found in the alburnum, and con&s;i&s;t of a &s;piral line, whether they
may properly be called ab&s;orbent or umbilical ve&s;&s;els, or con&s;i&s;t
of both, &s;hould ever have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be air-ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>There is neverthele&s;s an experiment by Dr. Hales, which
would at fir&s;t view countenance the a&s;&s;ertion, that vegetables ab|&s;orb
air. He cemented the lower end of a &s;mall twig of a tree
with leaves on it into a gla&s;s tube about four inches long, and &s;et
<PB N="12" REF="18">
the other end of the tube an inch deep in water, and ob&s;erved in
a little time that the water ro&s;e an inch in the tube; but this mu&s;t
happen from the vegetable ve&s;&s;els emptying them&s;elves by the
a&s;cent of their juices and having rigid coats, and therefore not
contracting, a portion of the air was forced into them by the
pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere, as in the above ob&s;ervation on the
vine-branch cut horizontally.</P>
<P>This reception of air does not happen to the ve&s;&s;els of animal
bodies, when they are emptied of their blood, owing to the le&s;s
rigidity of their coats; whence the weight of the atmo&s;pheric
air pre&s;&s;es their &s;ides together, and clo&s;es the ve&s;&s;el, in&s;tead of
pa&s;&s;ing into it. In the &s;ame manner no air would pa&s;s into the
ve&s;&s;els of the lungs of animals in re&s;piration, unle&s;s the pre&s;|&s;ure
of the atmo&s;phere on their &s;ides was prevented by the action
of the mu&s;cles, which enlarge the cavity of the thorax by eleva|ting
the ribs.</P>
<P>4. There are neverthele&s;s certain horizontal ve&s;&s;els of large di|ameter,
which pa&s;s through the bark of trees to the alburnum,
which probably contain air, as they are apparently empty, I be|lieve,
in the living vegetable; for the bark of trees con&s;i&s;ts of
longitudinal fibres, which are joined together, and appear to ino&s;|culate
at certain di&s;tances, and recede from each other between
tho&s;e di&s;tances like the me&s;hes of a net, in which &s;paces &s;everal
horizontal apertures are &s;een to penetrate through the bark to the
alburnum, according to Malpighi, who has given a figure of
them, which is copied in Plate I. Fig. 2. of this work. Very
fine horizontal perforations through the bark of trees are al&s;o
mentioned by Duhamel, which he believes to be per&s;piratory or
excretory organs, but adds, that there are others of much larger
diameter, &s;ome round and &s;ome oval, and which in the birch-tree
&s;tand prominent, and pierce the cuticle, or exterior bark.
Phy&s;ique des arbres, T. 1. Tab. III. Fig. 8. and 11.</P>
<P>The&s;e ve&s;&s;els probably contain air during the living &s;tate of the
tree, as they pierce the external bark, which frequently con&s;i&s;ts
of many doubles, like a roll of linen cloth; as a new cuticle is
annually produced beneath the old one, like a new &s;carf-&s;kin be|neath
a bli&s;ter in animal bodies; and the old one &s;ometimes con|tinues,
and &s;ometimes peels off like the cuticle of a &s;erpent, as
<PB N="13" REF="19">
is &s;een on the trunks of many cherry-trees and birches. The&s;e
ve&s;&s;els, when contracted in dry timber, appear like horizontal
in&s;ertions in many planed boards, in which the &s;piral ab&s;orbent
ve&s;&s;els become by their contraction the longitudinal fibres, as
appears in the figure of a walking cane given by Dr. Grew,
Tab. XX.</P>
<P>The&s;e horizontal ve&s;&s;els I &s;uppo&s;e to contain air inclo&s;ed in a
thin moi&s;t membrane, which may &s;erve the purpo&s;e of oxyge|nating
the fluid in the extremities of &s;ome fine arteries of the em|bryon
buds, in the &s;ame manner as the air at the broad end of
the egg is believed to oxygenate the fluids in the terminations of
the placental ve&s;&s;els of the embryon chick, as further noticed in
Sect. III. 2. 6. and III. 1. 4.</P>
<P>5. The ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of trees in pa&s;&s;ing down their trunks
con&s;i&s;t of long hollow cylinders, who&s;e &s;ides I believe to be
compo&s;ed of a &s;piral line, and are of &s;uch large diameters in
&s;ome vegetables as to be vi&s;ible to the naked eye, when they be|come
dry and empty, as in cane. Air will rapidly pa&s;s through
the&s;e ve&s;&s;els in either direction, as may be &s;een in lighting a cane
&s;ome inches long at either end, and drawing the &s;moke through
the pores of it into the mouth, as through a tobacco-pipe. Dr.
Hales readily pa&s;&s;ed both air and water through a recent vegeta|ble
&s;tick both upwards and downwards, by &s;etting one end of it
in a cup of water in the receiver of an air-pump, and exhau&s;t|ing
the air, Veg. Stat. p. 154; whence he concludes with Grew,
that the&s;e are air-ve&s;&s;els or lungs for the purpo&s;e of re&s;piration,
and that they receive atmo&s;pheric air in their natural &s;tate.</P>
<P>There is one objection to their u&s;e as air-ve&s;&s;els, which is,
that they have no communication with the horizontal air-ve&s;&s;els
above de&s;cribed; for by blowing forcibly through a piece of dry
cane immer&s;ed deep in water, no air is &s;een to bubble out of the
&s;ides, but only from the bottom of it. It may indeed be
&s;uppo&s;ed, that the longitudinal cavities in dry cane may not
con&s;i&s;t of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els above de&s;cribed, but of the
inter&s;tices between them, as the coats of tho&s;e ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els
con&s;i&s;ting a &s;piral line, may be thought to clo&s;e up by their ver|micular
contraction; and their inter&s;tices, of vegetable cel-
<PB N="14" REF="20">
con&s;i&s;ting of vegetable cellular membrane, may be &s;uppo&s;ed, when
dry, to become the tubes in cane. But in this ca&s;e the longi|tudinal
canals in dry cane would not be circular cylinders, whereas
they are &s;o repre&s;ented in a figure of a piece of cane much mag|nified
by Dr. Grew, Tab. XX. who has in the &s;ame figure
given the mouths of horizontal air-ve&s;&s;els of circular form
and larger diameter.</P>
<P>But there is another in&s;uperable objection to this idea of their,
u&s;e, which is, that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els equally exi&s;t in the roots of
plants, as in their trunks; and according to Malpighi; with
larger diameters; and probably terminate externally only in the
roots; and, as they are there not expo&s;ed to the atmo&s;phere,
they cannot &s;erve the purpo&s;e of re&s;piration; air neverthele&s;s in
its combined &s;tate, or even as di&s;&s;olved in water, may be ab&s;orbed
by the&s;e ve&s;&s;els; and may appear, when the pre&s;&s;ure of the at|mo&s;phere
is removed in the exhau&s;ted receiver; or when expanded
by heat, as is &s;een in the froth at one end of a green &s;tick, when
the other end is burning in the fire.</P>
<P>6. The&s;e vegetable ab&s;orbents differ from tho&s;e of animals in
the facility, with which they carry their fluids either way; for a
forked branch of a tree, torn from its trunk, and having one of
its forks with the leaves on it inverted in a ve&s;&s;el of water, will
continue for &s;everal days unwithered, nearly as well as if the
whole had been placed upright in the water. A willow rod on the
&s;ame account will grow almo&s;t equally well, whether the
apex or ba&s;e of it be &s;et in the ground; and Dr. Bradley, I
think, mentions a young goo&s;eberry-tree having been taken up,
and replanted with its branches in the earth, and its roots in the
air; and that the branches put forth root-fibres, and the roots
put forth leaf-buds. There is likewi&s;e a curious experiment by
Dr. Hales, who attached the ea&s;tern branch of a young tree
to its neighbour by inarching, and its we&s;tern branch to another
of its neighbours in the &s;ame manner; and after they were united,
he cut the &s;tem of the middle tree from its root, and thus left it
hanging in the air by its two inarched arms, where it flouri&s;hed
with con&s;iderable vigour.</P>
<P>This power of carrying their fluid contents in a retrograde di|rection
is al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;ome degree by the ab&s;orbents of ani|mals,
particularly in their di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate, and even in the opera|tion
<PB N="15" REF="21">
of an emetic, as &s;hewn in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. 29;
and is vi&s;ible in the oe&s;ophagus or throat of cows, who convey
their food fir&s;t downwards, and afterward upwards by a direct
and retrograde motion of the annular cartilages, which compo&s;e
the gullet for the purpo&s;e of rumination.</P>
<P>7. The &s;tructure of the&s;e large vegetable ab&s;orbents, erro|neou&s;ly
called air-ve&s;&s;els, probably con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;piral line, and
not of a ve&s;&s;el interrupted with valves, and differs in this con|&s;truction
from animal lymphatics; for fir&s;t, on breaking almo&s;t
any tender vegetable, as a la&s;t year's &s;prig of a ro&s;e-tree, or the
middle rib of a vine leaf, and gradually extending &s;ome of the
fibres, which adhere the longe&s;t, this &s;piral &s;tructure becomes
vi&s;ible even to the naked eye, and di&s;tinctly &s;o by the u&s;e of a
common lens, as is delineated in Duhamel's Phi&s;ique des arbres,
T. 1. Tab. II. Fig. 17, 18, 19, and in Plate LI. and LII. of
Grew's Anatomy of Plants (fol. edit.), and by this ea&s;y expe|riment
both that ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, which imbibes nouri&s;hment
from the earth, and brings it to the caudex of each bud; and
that which imbibes moi&s;ture from the air, and a part of the per|&s;pirable
matter on the &s;urface of the leaf, and brings it to the
caudex of each bud, are agreeably demon&s;trated. See Plate II.
Fig. 1. And that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els of large diameter, with their
&s;ides con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;piral line, are not arteries or veins, is
evinced by in&s;pecting a &s;tem of euphorbia, &s;purge; or the &s;talk
of a fig-leaf, ficus, immediately on dividing them, as the
milky juice oozes from a ring of ve&s;&s;els exterior to tho&s;e large
ab&s;orbents.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are not furni&s;hed with frequent
valves is countenanced by the experiments before mentioned in
No. 5 of this &s;ection, one of which con&s;i&s;ted of lighting a piece
of cane, and drawing the &s;moke through it, as through a to|bacco-pipe,
in either direction; and the other in placing a bit of
recent twig with one end of it in a cup of water in the receiver
of an air-pump, and cau&s;ing both air and water to pa&s;s through it
in either direction.</P>
<P>If the minuter branches of vegetable ab&s;orbents be of a &s;imilar
&s;tructure, it is ea&s;y to conceive how a vermicular or peri&s;taltic
motion of the ve&s;&s;el, beginning at the lowe&s;t part of it, each
<PB N="16" REF="22">
&s;piral ring &s;ucce&s;&s;ively contracting it&s;elf, <HI>till it fills up the tube,</HI>
mu&s;t forcibly pu&s;h forward its contents without the aid of valves;
and if this vermicular motion &s;hould begin at the upper end of the
ve&s;&s;el it mu&s;t with equal facility carry its contained fluid in a re|trograde
or contrary direction.</P>
<P>8. As the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els in the roots of plants are protected
from the fro&s;t in &s;ome degree by the earth which covers them;
they &s;eem at all times to be &s;ufficiently alive to drink up and pu&s;h
forwards their adapted fluid, &s;ince if a branch of a tree is brought
into a warm room, it will in general pullulate in the winter, as
&s;oon as the ve&s;&s;els of the upper part of the branch are rendered
&s;ufficiently irritable by warmth to act in concert with the ab&s;or|bents
of the root. Neverthele&s;s, in &s;evere fro&s;ts it is nece&s;&s;ary to
guard all the parts of the &s;tem which is expo&s;ed to the open air,
as is experienced in the vines brought through holes into hot|hou&s;es,
otherwi&s;e after the buds are put out a &s;evere fro&s;t &s;o af|fects
the &s;tems on the out&s;ide of the hou&s;e as to de&s;troy all the
fruit of the year. Kenedy on Gardening, Vol. I. p. 270.
And it is ob&s;erved in Mr. A. Aikin's Natural Hi&s;tory of the
Year, that much ice was carried from the &s;treets in London in
1794, and piled round &s;ome elm trees in Moorfields, many of
which were de&s;troyed in the en&s;uing &s;pring by the &s;low melting
of it.</P>
<P>9. The ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of vegetables, like tho&s;e of animal
bodies, are liable to err in the &s;election of their proper aliment,
and hence they &s;ometimes drink up poi&s;onous fluids, to the de|triment
or de&s;truction of the plant. Dr. Hales put the end of
a branch of an apple-tree, part of which was previou&s;ly cut off,
into a quart of rectified &s;pirit of wine and camphor, which quan|tity
the &s;tem imbibed in three hours, which killed one half of
the tree. Veg. Stat. p. 43. Some years ago I &s;prinkled on
&s;ome branches of a wall-tree a very &s;light &s;olution of ar&s;enic,
with intent to de&s;troy in&s;ects; but it at the &s;ame time de&s;troyed
the branches it was thrown upon. And I was informed by Mr.
Wedgewood, that the fruit-trees planted in his garden near
Newca&s;tle in Stafford&s;hire, which con&s;i&s;ted of an acid clay be|neath
the factitious &s;oil, became unhealthy as &s;oon as their roots
penetrated the clay; and on infpection it appeared, that the small
<PB N="17" REF="23">
fibres of the roots, which had thus penetrated the clay, were
dead and decayed, probably corroded by the vitriolic acid of the
clay, beneath which is a bed of coals.</P>
<P>It is, however, a&s;&s;erted by M. Buffon, that the roots of many
plants will creep a&s;ide to avoid bad earth, or to approach good.
Hi&s;t. Nat. Vol. III. But this is perhaps better accounted for
by &s;uppo&s;ing, that the roots put out no ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, where
they are not &s;timulated by proper juices; and that an elongation
roots in con&s;equence only &s;ucceeds, when they find proper nu|triment.</P>
<P>10. The&s;e long and large cylindrical ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which
pa&s;s from the roots of trees up to the &s;ummit of the caudex of
each bud at the foot-&s;talk of the leaf, I &s;uppo&s;e to be analogous
to the receptacle of the chyle of animals, as the &s;mall ab&s;orbent
branches of the roots probably unite beneath the &s;oil into tho&s;e
large ve&s;&s;els, which are &s;o ea&s;ily vi&s;ible; hence the caudex of
each bud con&s;i&s;ts of an elongation of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, and of
arteries and veins reaching from the union of the root-branches
to the foot-&s;talk of each leaf, and the plumula of the bud in its
bo&s;om, as de&s;cribed in Sect. I. 7.</P>

<P>I. 1. THE &s;eeds of vegetables are a &s;exual offspring corre&s;|ponding
with the eggs of animals, and contain, like them, not
only the rudiment of the new organization, but al&s;o a quantity
of aliment laid up for its early nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The eggs of birds contain two kinds of albumen, or white,
one le&s;s vi&s;cid than the other, which is fir&s;t con&s;umed, and the
yolk or vitellum, which is drawn up into the bowels of the chick,
at its exclu&s;ion from the &s;hell, and &s;erves it for nouri&s;hment a day
or two, till it can learn to &s;elect and dige&s;t grains or in&s;ects. In
like manner many &s;eeds are furni&s;hed with two kinds of nou|ri&s;hment,
the mucilaginous or oily meal of the &s;eed-lobes, and
the &s;accharine or ace&s;cent pulp of the fruit, as in pears, plums,
cucumbers, which &s;upply nutriment to the embryon plant, till it
is able to &s;trike into the earth &s;ufficient roots for the purpo&s;e of
ab&s;orbing its nutritious juices.</P>
<P>The &s;pawn of fi&s;h, and of frogs, and of in&s;ects, as of &s;nails
and bees, which are almo&s;t as innumerable as the &s;eeds of plants,
and are in the &s;ame manner excited into life by the warmth of
the &s;un, are analogous to tho&s;e &s;eeds, I believe, which are not
&s;urrounded with fruit, and which contain but one kind of nou|ri&s;hment
for the embryon plant, as grains of corn, and legumes;
but perhaps the&s;e have not yet been &s;ufficiently attended to by
philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>The&s;e eggs of animals and &s;eeds of vegetables are produced
by the congre&s;s of male and female organs; the former &s;upply|ing
the &s;peck of animation or cicatricula in the egg, and the cor|culum
or heart in the &s;eed; and the latter producing the nidus,
or ne&s;t for its reception, and the nutritive material for its fir&s;t
&s;upport. Thus the eggs of fowls are formed long before they
are impregnated, and are &s;ometimes laid in their unimpregnated
&s;tate; and the &s;eeds of legumes are vi&s;ible many days before the
<PB N="20" REF="26">
flower opens, and in con&s;equence before they are impregnated,
as ob&s;erved by Spallanzani.</P>
<P>2. The eggs of birds contain a bag of air at their broad end
for the purpo&s;e of oxygenating the blood of the chick. In this
one circum&s;tance the &s;eeds of plants &s;eem to differ from the eggs
of birds, as they contain no air-bag, though it is probable they
may agree with the &s;pawn of fi&s;h, which I &s;uppo&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s no in|cluded
air. When the &s;eeds fall on the ground in their natural
&s;tate of growth, or are buried an inch or two beneath the &s;oil,
which has recently been turned over, and thus contains much
air in its inter&s;tices, their coats do not continue dry like the
&s;hells of eggs during incubation, but immediately become moi&s;t
membranes, like the external membrane of the &s;pawn of fi&s;h im|mer&s;ed
in water, and in con&s;equence can admit the oxygenation
of the air through them to an adapted &s;et of arteries on their
internal &s;urface, according to the curious ob&s;ervations of Dr.
Prie&s;tley on the oxygenation of the blood by the air through
the moi&s;t membranes of the lungs.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be here ob&s;erved, that many &s;eeds, before they fall
on the moi&s;t earth, are included in a bag of air, as tho&s;e of the
&s;taphylea, bladder-nut; of the phy&s;alis alhekengi, winter-cherry;
of colutea, bladder-&s;enna; in the pods of peas and beans; in
the cells &s;urrounding the &s;eeds of apples and pears; and in the
receptacle of ketmia, which probably &s;erves to oxygerate the
blood of the infant &s;eed, which in the&s;e plants may thus be of
forwardes growth, before it is &s;hed upon the &s;oil.</P>
<P>3. There exi&s;ts a &s;eries of glands, and their ducts, impro|perly
called umbilical ve&s;&s;els by &s;ome writers, which &s;upplies the
&s;eed with nouri&s;hment from the parent plant, &s;o long as it ad|heres
to the ovarium of its mother, as the ve&s;&s;els by which a pea
adheres to the pod, in which it is included; in fruits and nuts,
where the kernel is covered with a &s;tone or &s;hell, a long cord of
ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;es into the bottom of the &s;tone or &s;hell, and ri&s;ing to
the top bends round the lobes of the kernel, and is in&s;erted
near or into the corculum or heart of the &s;eed, where the living
principle re&s;ides, and affords not only pre&s;ent nutrition to the
vegetable embryon, but al&s;o &s;ecretes the farinaceous or oily ma|terials
for its future nouri&s;hment, which con&s;titute the cotyledons
of the &s;eed.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27">
But the ve&s;&s;els, which may be properly called umbilical, pa&s;s
from the heart or corculum of the &s;eed, which is the living em|bryon
of the future plant, into the &s;eed-lobes commonly called
cotyledons, and imbibe from thence a &s;olution of the farinaceous
or oily matter there depo&s;ited for the nutriment of the new vege|table.
The&s;e ve&s;&s;els are delineated in their magnified appearance
by Dr. Grew, Plate LXXIX. fol. edition, and are by him
termed &s;eminal roots. See Plate I. Fig. 1.</P>
<P>The&s;e umbilical ve&s;&s;els probably con&s;i&s;t of a &s;y&s;tem of ab&s;or|bents,
which &s;upply nutriment to the embryon plant from the
cotyledons of the &s;eed, and al&s;o of a &s;y&s;tem of placental arteries
and veins &s;pread on the humid membrane, which covers the co|tyledons,
and is moi&s;tened by its contact with the earth, for the
purpo&s;e of oxygenating the vegetable blood. This idea is coun|tenanced
by many plants bringing up their cotyledons, or &s;eed-lobes,
out of the ground into the air, which are then converted
into leaves, and perform the office of lungs, after they have given
up beneath the &s;oil the nutriment, which they previou&s;ly con|tained,
as in the young kidney-bean, pha&s;eolus; &s;o the white
corol of the helleborus niger, chri&s;tmas ro&s;e, is changed into a
green calyx by loo&s;ing one &s;y&s;tem of arteries after the impregna|tion
of the &s;eeds.</P>
<P>The &s;eed-embryon therefore re&s;embles the chick in the egg,
fir&s;t as when vivi&s;ied by the influence of external warmth they
both begin their growth by the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els being
&s;timulated into action by their adapted nutriment; and the fluids
thus pu&s;hed forwards &s;timulate into action the other parts of the
&s;y&s;tem, con&s;i&s;ting at fir&s;t principally of arteries and glands.</P>
<P>Secondly, they &s;eem to re&s;emble each other in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
each of them an ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els, which imbibe the
nutritious matters laid up for them in the albumen or white of
the egg, and in the cotyledons or lobes of the &s;eed; and al&s;o of
a placental &s;y&s;tem of arteries for the purpo&s;e of oxygenating their
fluids, as de&s;cribed above in the &s;eed, and which appears in the
egg to be &s;pread on a membrane, which covers the white, as is
&s;hewn in the plates of Malpighi, and called by him the chorion,
and expo&s;es the blood of the chick to the oxygen of the air
contained at the broad end of the egg through a moi&s;t membrane.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="28">
4. The u&s;e of the large apparent artery &s;pread on the coty|ledons
of a germinating &s;eed of a garden-bean, called &s;eminal
roots by Grew, as &s;hewn in Plate I. Fig. 1, and that &s;pread on
the chorion of the chick in the egg, &s;o called by Malpighi, and
&s;hewn in Tom. II. Fig. 54, and by Fabricius ab Aquapendente,
Tab. I. Fig. 13, which mu&s;t be an artery as it carries red blood,
are believed to be re&s;piratory organs, like the placental ve&s;&s;els of
the fetus of viviparous animals, becau&s;e the cotyledons of &s;ome
&s;eeds ri&s;e out of the ground, and become leaves, after the nutri|ment
they contained is expended, and are then called &s;eminal
leaves, as in the kidney-bean, pha&s;eolus; and becau&s;e tho&s;e
which do not ri&s;e out of the ground peri&s;h beneath the &s;oil, as
&s;oon as the young plant gains it leaves, which are its aerial re&s;pi|ratory
organ.</P>
<P>Secondly, the chorion of the chick con&s;i&s;ts of a membrane
including the white, or albumen, and is not only in contact with
the air-bag at the broad end of the egg, which, as the chick ad|vances,
covers more than half of the internal &s;urface of the &s;hell,
but al&s;o with the membrane which lines all the other part of the
&s;hell, as appears in Plate III. which is copied from Malpighi:
yet this exten&s;ive chorion, with the numerous arteries and veins
which are &s;pread upon its &s;urface, is not drawn up into the body
of the chick like the yolk and its including membrane, but pe|ri&s;hes
at the nativity of the chick like the placental ve&s;&s;els of the
fetus of viviparous animals; or &s;ometimes, I &s;uppo&s;e, before its
nativity, as the chick perforates the air-bag, and is heard to chirp,
before it is excluded from the &s;hell.</P>
<P>Hence it would appear, that both the artery attending the &s;e|minal
roots abovementioned, and this artery on the chorion of
the chick, mu&s;t perform &s;ome more important office than to &s;up|ply
nouri&s;hment to the coats of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which im|bibe
the mucilage of the &s;eed, or the white of the egg, and which
ab&s;orbents mu&s;t them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s their proper va&s;a va&s;orum.
And what more important office can they have than that of
oxygenating the blood of the vegetable or animal embryon? And
this becomes more probable as they both peri&s;h at its nativity like
the placenta and cotyledons of viviparous animals.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="29">
5. As the incubation of the chick advances, it differs from
the &s;eed-embryon in the production of inte&s;tines, with a &s;tomach,
on the internal &s;urfaces of which the mouths of the ab&s;orbents
now terminate; and la&s;tly in the production of a mouth and
throat to receive and &s;wallow the remainder of the albumen, in
which it &s;wims; whereas the &s;eed-embryon &s;hoots down new
roots into the earth with an ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem to acquire its nu|triment,
as that from the cotyledons of the &s;eed becomes ex|hau&s;ted.
See Sect. VII. 1, 2.</P>
<P>Nor is there any thing &s;imilar to the yolk of the egg found in
the &s;eeds of vegetables, which is drawn up into the inte&s;tines of
the young chick about the time of its exclu&s;ion from the &s;hell to
&s;erve it with nutriment for a day or two, till it can learn of its
parent by imitation to &s;elect and &s;wallow its adapted food. Nor
is the fetus of viviparous animals furni&s;hed with any thing &s;imilar
to the yolk of oviparous ones, as they have milk ready prepared
for their fir&s;t nutriment in the brea&s;t of the mother.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the new foliage of the plant ri&s;ing out of the ground
becomes expanded, and the root de&s;cending penetrates the earth
with its fibrous ramifications, the umbilical &s;y&s;tems of ve&s;&s;els
cea&s;e to act, both the ab&s;orbents, which previou&s;ly &s;upplied the
young embryon with nutriment from the cotyledons, and al&s;o
the placental artery, which was &s;pread on the exterior mem|brane
of the cotyledons for the purpo&s;e of oxygenation. The&s;e
ve&s;&s;els now either coale&s;ce and decay beneath the &s;oil, or wither
and fall off, when rai&s;ed above it in the form of &s;eed-leaves.</P>
<P>II. 1. The &s;eeds of plants are thus a &s;exual or amatorial pro|geny,
produced principally by the male part of the flower, and
received into a proper nidus, and &s;upplied with nutriment by
the female part of it, and which can thus claim both a father and
a mother. But the buds of vegetables are a linear progeny,
produced and nouri&s;hed by a father alone, to whom they adhere,
not falling off like the &s;eeds, as is farther treated of in Zoono|mia,
Vol. 1. Sect. XXXIX. II. 2. and in Sect. VII. I. 3. of
this work. For in this mo&s;t &s;imple kind of vegetable reproduc|tion,
by the buds of trees, and by the bulbs of &s;ome plants, and
by the wires of others, which are their viviparous progeny, the
caudex of the leaf is the parent of the bud or bulb, or wire,
<PB N="24" REF="30">
which ri&s;es in its bo&s;om, according to the ob&s;ervation of Lin|neus.</P>
<P>This linear or paternal progeny of vegetables in buds or bulbs,
or wires, is attended with a very curious circum&s;tance, which is
that they exactly re&s;emble their parents, when they are arrived
at their maturity, as &s;hewn in Sect. VII. 1. 3. as is ob&s;erved in
grafting fruit-trees, and in propagating flower-roots, or &s;trawber|ries,
or potatoes, by their wires or roots; whereas the &s;eminal
offspring of plants, as it derives its form in part from the mother
as well as father, is liable to perpetual variation, both which
events are employed to great advantage by &s;kilful gardeners.</P>
<P>2. As the embryons in the buds are the viviparous offspring of
vegetables, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, as they have no mouths, that
they &s;hould be furni&s;hed like the embryons in the &s;eeds with um|biblical
ve&s;&s;els to &s;upply them with nouri&s;hment, till they acquire
roots with another &s;et of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els to imbibe moi&s;ture
from the earth, and leaves to aft like lungs for the purpo&s;e of
oxygenating their blood.</P>
<P>The&s;e umbilical ve&s;&s;els, which &s;upply the buds of plants with
nouri&s;hment in the early &s;pring, and unfold their foliage, have
been much attended to by Dr. Hales and Dr. Walker (Edinb.
Phil. Tran&s;act. Vol. I.) The former ob&s;erved, that the &s;ap
from the &s;tump of a vine, which he had cut off in the beginning
of April, aro&s;e twenty-one feet high in gla&s;s tubes affixed to it
for that purpo&s;e, but which in a few weeks cea&s;ed to bleed. Dr.
Walker al&s;o marked the progre&s;s of the a&s;cending &s;ap in various
branches of trees, and ob&s;erved, that in cold weather it &s;topped
many hours in a day, as well as in the night, and found like-wi&s;e
as &s;oon as the leaves became expanded, that the wounded
trees cea&s;ed to bleed.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els, which convey the &s;ap-juice with &s;uch amazing
force, are &s;ituated in or compo&s;e the alburnum, or &s;ap-wood, of
the trunk or root of the tree; nor is it &s;urprizing, that &s;ome of
it when pre&s;&s;ed by &s;o high a column &s;hould ex&s;ude into the cells
between the alburnum and bark, as in the&s;e cells much &s;ap-juice
was ob&s;erved by Dr. Walker, and this accounts for the great ea&s;e
with which the barks of willows and of oaks are &s;eparated in the
&s;pring from their wood. The ab&s;orbent mouths of the&s;e &s;ap-ve&s;|&s;els
<PB N="25" REF="31">
open externally in the moi&s;t earth on the roots of trees, and
al&s;o into the air on their trunks; and thus mix the aqueous fluids,
which they thus imbibe with the &s;accharine and mucilaginous mate|rials
depo&s;ited previou&s;ly in the alburnum of the&s;e roots and trunks.</P>
<P>3. This a&s;cending &s;ap-juice during the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on is in &s;ome
trees &s;o &s;weet, that it is u&s;ed in making wine, as that of the
birch-tree in this country; and &s;ugar is procured in &s;uch quantity
from a maple in Pen&s;ylvania, that from each tree five or &s;ix
pounds of good &s;ugar have been made annually without de&s;troy|ing
it. Ru&s;h, on Sugar Maple. Philips, London. This &s;ugar
is depo&s;ited I believe in the &s;ap-wood of the trunk and roots of
trees, as in the manna-a&s;h, and is di&s;&s;olved in the &s;pring by the
moi&s;ture, which is drank up by the ab&s;orbents from the earth
and atmo&s;phere, and forcibly carried on to expand the buds. Its
exi&s;tence in the &s;ap-wood as well as in the roots is &s;hewn from the
pullulation of oak-trees, which have been &s;tripped of their bark,
and al&s;o from the expan&s;ion of the eyes of a vine-&s;hoot, when it is
cut from the tree, and planted in the, earth, as de&s;cribed in Sect.
XV. 1. 3.</P>
<P>This &s;ugge&s;ts to us the rea&s;on why the wood of trees is &s;o much
&s;ooner &s;ubject to decay, when they are felled in the vernal months;
becau&s;e the &s;ugar, which the &s;ap-wood then contains, &s;oon
runs into fermentation, and produces what is called the dry-rot;
whence the cu&s;tom has prevailed of debarking oaks in the &s;pring
and felling them in the autumn; and it is probable that the wood
of all other trees would la&s;t much longer, if it was thus ma|naged,
as the growth of the new leaves would exhau&s;t the &s;ugar
of the &s;ap-wood.</P>
<P>Sweet juices for a &s;imilar purpo&s;e of expanding the buds of
herbaceous plants are depo&s;ited during the autumn in their roots,
as in turnep, beet, tragapogon; or in the knots or joints of the
&s;tem, as in gra&s;&s;es, and the &s;ugar-cane; which like the farina and
oil in &s;eeds, and the dulcet mucilage of fruits, and the honey of
flowers, were de&s;igned for the food of the young progeny of
plants, but become the &s;u&s;tenance of mankind!</P>
<P>As the &s;accharine matter which is thus depo&s;ited in the roots,
or in the alburnum, or in the joints of plants, mu&s;t be diluted by
the moi&s;ture ab&s;orbed from the earth by their roots, we under&s;tand,
why the leaves of the lower branches of trees are fir&s;t expanded,
<PB N="26" REF="32">
as &s;een di&s;tinctly in the hawthorn hedges in April, as the&s;e mu&s;t
fir&s;t receive the a&s;cending &s;ap-juice, as was ob&s;erved by Dr.
Walker in his account of the maple.</P>
<P>4. The force of the ri&s;ing &s;ap from a vine-&s;tump in the bleed|ing
&s;ea&s;on, as di&s;covered by Dr. Hales, is at &s;ome times equal to
the whole pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere, which is about fourteen
pounds on a &s;quare inch of &s;urface. This great power in rai&s;ing
the &s;ap he a&s;cribes to capillary attraction, and to the variations of
heat daring the day and night. In regard to capillary attraction,
however high it may rai&s;e a fluid in very &s;mall tubes, it can not
make it flow over them, as the &s;ap-juice did in Dr. Hales's vine|&s;tump;
nor can it rai&s;e a fluid quite to a level with the upper
rim of a gla&s;s tube, as the fluid is there more attracted down|wards
by the gla&s;s be&s;ides its gravity, and is left in con&s;equence
with a concave &s;urface.</P>
<P>The means by which vegetable ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els in their
living &s;tate imbibe the fluids of the earth and atmo&s;phere, and
carry them forwards with &s;o much force, mu&s;t be &s;imilar to tho&s;e,
with which animal ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els perform the &s;ame office;
that is by their mouths being excited into action by the &s;timulus
of the fluids, which they ab&s;orb.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance is confirmed by the evident proofs of the
irritability of plants in various other in&s;tances, as the clo&s;ing and
opening of the petals and calyxes of flowers by light and dark|ne&s;e,
warmth and cold, dryne&s;s and moi&s;ture, and by the mo|tions
of the leaves of mimo&s;a, or &s;en&s;itive plant, and of dionoea
mu&s;cipula, by any mechanical &s;timulus. To this might be added
a variety of in&s;tances of the irritability of vegetables to the &s;ti|mulus
of heat, being increa&s;ed after a previous expo&s;ure to cold,
exactly in the &s;ame manner as happens to animal bodies, which
are enumerated in a note in the Botanic Garden, Vol. I. Canto
I. l. 322, whence the reciprocal times of the acting and the
cea&s;ing to act of the&s;e vernal vegetable ab&s;orbents, which are
here termed umbilical ve&s;&s;els, in the experiments both of Dr.
Hales and Dr. Walker, may be readily explained by their
having been benumbed by the cold, or excited into action by the
warmth of the air or earth. See Sect. XIII. 2. 3.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33">
From one experiment neverthele&s;s of Dr. Walker's the&s;e
ve&s;&s;els occa&s;ionally act as capillary &s;yphons, becau&s;e when he
bent down a branch much lower than its origin from the tree,
and cut off the end of it in the bleeding &s;ea&s;on, the &s;ap flowed
from the extremity of this branch &s;o bent down, when &s;ome
wounds two or three feet lower than the origin of this branch
did not bleed. This may be accounted for from the a&s;cent of
the fluid in the&s;e ve&s;&s;els being at this time principally owing to
the action of their ab&s;orbent mouths, and to their con&s;i&s;ting of
long cylinders with minute diameters and rigid coats, like tho&s;e
which are vi&s;ible to the eye in dry cane, through which &s;moke
will pals in either direction, and which at this early &s;ea&s;on may
not be excited into vegetable action; there is neverthele&s;s a power
of ab&s;orption exi&s;ting in any part of them in the warmer &s;ea&s;on,
becau&s;e a branch or flower-&s;talk cut from the root, and &s;et in a
gla&s;s of water, will drink up a con&s;iderable quantity of it. There
is al&s;o a &s;ituation-in their di&s;ea&s;ed or dead &s;tate, where they ap|pear
to act for &s;ome years alike capillary tubes, as in the decortica|part
of a pear-tree, de&s;cribbed in Sect. XV. 2, 3.</P>
<P>5. During the great action of the&s;e umbilical ab&s;orbent ve&s;|&s;els
the buds become expanded, that is the young vegetable
beings put forth leaves, which are their lungs, and con&s;i&s;t of a
pulmonary artery, vein, and ab&s;orbents, and al&s;o acquire a new
bark over that of the branches, trunk, and roots, of the la&s;t year,
which con&s;i&s;ts of aortal arteries, veins, and ab&s;orbents, and new
radicles, which terminate in the &s;oil. At this time the umbilical
ve&s;&s;els, which exi&s;ted in the alburnum, or &s;ap-wood, cea&s;e to
act, and coale&s;ce into more &s;olid wood, perhaps &s;imply by the
contraction of the &s;piral fibre, of which they are compo&s;ed; and
the &s;warm of new vegetables, which con&s;titute a tree, are now
nouri&s;hed by their proper lacteal and lymphatic &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>A curious circum&s;tance now occurs, which is that wherever
a tree is now wounded, no moi&s;ture appears. On the contrary,
the wound from Dr. Hales's experiments is in a &s;trongly ab&s;orb|ing
&s;tate, in&s;omuch that on applying water to wounds made in
the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, it was found to be drank up with great force,
as was ingeniou&s;ly &s;hewn by mercurial &s;yphons contrived to re&s;i&s;t
its ab&s;orption.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="34">
This evinces, that though during the bleeding &s;ea&s;on in the
vernal months the &s;ap-juice is imbibed by the umbilical ab&s;orbents,
and carried upwards probably by the annular contraction of the
&s;piral fibres, which I believe compo&s;e the&s;e ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, in
&s;uch quantities as to bleed wherever the alburnum is expo&s;ed or
wounded, yet that afterwards the exhalation by the numerous
leaves becomes &s;o great, that the actions of the new radical and
lateral ab&s;orbents do not &s;upply a fluid &s;o fa&s;t, as it could other|wi&s;e
be expended in the growth of the plant, or di&s;&s;ipated into
the air; and as the ve&s;&s;els, which pa&s;s down the trunks of trees,
ino&s;culate in variety of places, as is &s;een in the cloth made at
Otaheite from the bark of a mulberry-tree, when a wound is
made through &s;ome of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, the fluid, which might
otherwise ooze out, is carried away laterally by tho&s;e in their
vicinity; and as the ve&s;&s;els of vegetables are rigid, and do not
collap&s;e when wounded like tho&s;e of animals; and as the circu|lation
in them is comparatively &s;low, but little of their contained
fluids are poured out of them when wounded in the &s;ummer
months.</P>
<P>6. From all the&s;e ob&s;ervations it finally appears, that the um|bilical
ve&s;&s;els of each bud are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of a &s;eed, which
are called by Dr. Grew &s;eminal roots, and that like the umbilical
cords, which form the wires of &s;trawberries above ground, and
of potatoes under ground, they &s;upply the new vegetable with
nutriment, till the leaves are expanded in the air, and new roots
are pu&s;hed out and penetrate the earth.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a curious analogy between the&s;e umbilical ve&s;|&s;els
of buds, which exi&s;t in the alburnum of trees, and tho&s;e
belonging to the chick in the egg, which con&s;i&s;ts in their both
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing certain air-ve&s;&s;els; tho&s;e of trees pa&s;s horizontally
from the bark to the alburnum, and that of the egg exi&s;ts at the
broad end of it. Thus it is probable, that the fluid in the fine
extremities of the new ve&s;&s;els of the embryon bud becomes oxy|genated
by the&s;e horizontal air-ve&s;&s;els, in the &s;ame manner as the
fluid in the terminations of the arteries on the chorion of the
chick is believed to become oxygenated by the air contained
at the broad end of the egg, as alluded to in Sect. II. 4. and
III. 1. 4.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="35">
A circum&s;tance, in which the bud may be conceived to differ
from the egg, con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;eparation of the egg from its parent,
as &s;oon as the fetus has acquired a certain maturity, along with
its umbilical ve&s;&s;els, and its re&s;ervoir of nutriment. But in ve|getables
&s;omething &s;imilar occurs, for the parent bud is &s;eparated
by death in the autumn from its embryon offspring; the leaf
falls off, which was the lungs of the parent bud, and the ve&s;&s;els
of its caudex, which formed the bark, coale&s;ce into alburnum,
or &s;ap-wood, &s;urrounding the umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the new bud;
which thus may be &s;aid to loo&s;e its parent like the egg, but re|tains
its umbilical ve&s;&s;els, and a re&s;ervoir of nutriment, which
exi&s;ts in the &s;ap-wood, and al&s;o another &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els, which
con&s;titute the new bark of the tree, con&s;i&s;ting of the interwoven
caudexes of each individual new bud.</P>
<P>But as the umbilical ve&s;&s;els of plants above de&s;cribed, which
con&s;titute the alburnum of the trunks of trees, and the &s;eminal
roots, &s;o called, of the growing &s;eed, convey nutriment to the
embryon bud, or to the ri&s;ing plumula, as well as oxygenation,
they are not &s;imilar in that re&s;pect to the placenta of the animal
fetus, and were improperly called placental ve&s;&s;els in the notes to
the Botanic Garden, as the placenta of the animal fetus is &s;hewn
in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXXVIII. to be an organ of re&s;|piration
only, like the gills of fi&s;h, and not an organ for nu|trition.</P>
<P>Hence when the cotyledons of &s;eeds are cut away from the
ri&s;ing plume, the plant becomes a dwarf for want of nutriment;
and the wounding or expo&s;ing the alburnum of bleeding trees, as
of the birch or maple, in the vernal months to obtain the &s;ap-juice
retards the expan&s;ion of the new buds, and the con&s;e|quent
growth of the tree. Hence al&s;o it appears, why &s;mear|ing
the bark of a tree with pitch, or oil, or paint, is liable to
de&s;troy the new buds, and con&s;equently the tree, by &s;topping up
their &s;piracula; and why covering an egg with grea&s;e or varni&s;h
is &s;aid to prevent the production of a chicken, by preventing a
change of air at the broad end of it.</P>
<P>7. We may conclude that the umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the new bud
are formed along with a re&s;ervoir of nutritious aliment about
mid&s;ummer in the bark, which con&s;titutes the long caudex of
<PB N="30" REF="36">
the parent bud, in the &s;ame manner as a re&s;ervoir of nutritious
matter is formed in the root or broad caudex of the turnep or
onion, for the nouri&s;hment of the ri&s;ing &s;tem. And that the&s;e
umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the embryon bud, and the re&s;ervoir of nutri-ment
laid up for it, which is &s;ecreted by the glands of the parent
bud, and now intermixed with the pre&s;ent bark of the tree, be|come
gradually changed into alburnum, or &s;ap-wood, as the &s;ea|&s;on
advances, in part even before the end of &s;ummer, and en|tirely
during the winter months.</P>
<P>That the alburnum of trees, which exi&s;ts beneath the bark
both of the trunk and roots of them, contains the nutritious
matter depo&s;ited by the mature leaves or parent buds for the u&s;e of
the embryon buds, appears not only from the &s;accharine liquor,
which oozes from the wounds made in the vernal months
through the bark into the alburnum of the birch and maple,
betula et acer; but al&s;o from the following experiment, which
was conducted in the winter before the vernal &s;ap-juice ri&s;es.</P>
<P>Part of a branch of an oak-tree, in January was cut off, and
divided carefully into three parts, the bark, the alburnum, and
the heart. The&s;e were &s;haved or ra&s;ped, and &s;eparately boiled
for a time in water, and then &s;et in a warm room to ferment;
and it was &s;een that the decoction of the alburnum or &s;ap-wood
pa&s;&s;ed into rapid fermentation, and became at length acetous,
but not either of the other, which evinces the exi&s;tence both of
&s;ugar and mucilage in the alburnum during the winter months;
&s;ince a modern French chemi&s;t has &s;hewn by experiments, that
&s;ugar alone will not pa&s;s into the vinous fermentation, but that a
mixture of mucilage is al&s;o required; and from this experi|ment
it may be concluded, that in years of &s;carcity the &s;ap-wood
of tho&s;e trees, which are not acrid to the ta&s;te, might afford nu|triment
by the preparation of being ra&s;ped to powder, and made
into bread by a mixture of flour, or by extracting their &s;ugar and
mucilage by boiling in water, as mentioned in Zoonomia, Part
III. Article I. 2, 3. 6.</P>
<P>Now as the embryon buds of deciduous trees of this climate
are formed about mid&s;ummer, &s;ecreted by the generative glands
in the caudex of the parent leaf-bud, and are &s;upplied with due
nouri&s;hment from the &s;ame &s;ource, not having yet &s;hot out radi|cles
<PB N="31" REF="37">
of their own from the lower end of their long caudexes into
the earth, they may be readily tran&s;planted at this &s;ea&s;on from
one tree to another by inoculation, or into different parts of the
&s;ame tree; as the new caudex of the young bud of one tree will
readily unite with the new caudex of that of another tree, and
as they can be removed entire during the early &s;tate of their
growth along with a part of the bark only, as &s;carcely any al|burnum
is yet formed beneath the bark of the young twig, from
whence the bud is cut or torn.</P>
<P>But after their greater maturity, &s;o that many buds exi&s;t on one
twig, or &s;cion, and are already furni&s;hed with radicles pa&s;&s;ing
down into the ground, as in the en&s;uing &s;pring, it becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to ingraft them by cutting off a part of the alburnum, as
well as of the bark of the new bud; and to apply the&s;e in con|tact
with the bark and alburnum of another tree, to which they
may grow by ino&s;culation of ve&s;&s;els; whence it appears why bud|ding
or inoculation mu&s;t be performed &s;oon after mid&s;ummer, and
ingrafting in the early &s;pring, as in the former the buds continue
to grow by the junction of the caudex or bark ve&s;&s;els alone with
tho&s;e of the tree into which they are in&s;erted, and in the latter
by the ino&s;culation of their ve&s;&s;els with tho&s;e of the bark and
alburnum of the tree to which they are applied and bound.</P>
<P>The ino&s;culation of the ve&s;&s;els of a bud cut out of one tree and
in&s;erted into the bark and alburnum of another, as in the in|graftment
of &s;cions, is exactly re&s;embled by a &s;imilar operation
on animal bodies, when a tooth is taken from one per&s;on and
in&s;erted into the head of another, and where two inflamed parts
grow together. Thus an experienced anatomi&s;t is &s;aid to have
cut the two &s;purs from a young cock, and applied them to the
oppo&s;ite &s;ides of his comb, which was previou&s;ly excoriated,
where they continued to grow and appeared like horns; and Ta|licotius,
who&s;e book lies by me, &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, that he &s;uc|ceded
in making artificial no&s;es from a part of the &s;kin of the
arm of his patients, and has publi&s;hed prints of the manner of
the operation, &s;o ridiculed by the author of Hudibras. Chei|rurgia
Ca&s;paris Talicotii.</P>
<P>The growth of an inoculated bud on the bark of another tree,
where the upper part of the caudex of the inoculated bud joins
<PB N="32" REF="38">
with the lower part of the caudex of another bud belonging to
the &s;tock, is &s;till more nicely re&s;embled by the union of the head
and tail part of two different polypi in the experiment of Blu|menbach
mentioned in Sect. VII. 3. 2. of this work.</P>
<P>8. As the leaves of trees become expanded, the &s;ap-juice
above de&s;cribed cea&s;es to flow, and the bark of the tree then ad|heres
to the alburnum. Afterwards from the middle of June to
the middle of Augu&s;t, as Dr. Bradley has ob&s;erved, there &s;eems
to be a pau&s;e in vegetation; at which time the new buds in the
bo&s;om of each leaf &s;eem to be generated, and the bark, which
during the two preceding months adhered to the wood, now ea|&s;ily
&s;eparates, as in the &s;pring, according to the ob&s;ervation of
Du Hamel, Vol. II. 261; and vegetation, which appeared to
langui&s;h during the heats of mid&s;ummer, acquires new vigour at
the approach of autumn like that of &s;pring.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance, which &s;eems to have puzzled many natu|rali&s;ts,
is to be explained from the action of the umbilical ve&s;|&s;els
of the new buds, which begin to enlarge as &s;oon as they are
formed, and in this climate have their progre&s;s &s;topped by the
cold during the winter, and the moi&s;ture which ex&s;udes from
the &s;ides of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and is extrava&s;ated between the albur|num
and the bark, cau&s;es an ea&s;y &s;eparation of them from each
other.</P>
<P>From the new flow of &s;ap in the&s;e ve&s;&s;els about mid&s;ummer,
being probably in part conveyed to the leaves by the retrograde
action of their lymphatics in very hot weather, the honey-dew
&s;eems to originate either as an ex&s;udation from the leaf, or from
the ve&s;&s;els being punctured by the aphis, which drinks the vege|table
chyle in &s;uch great quantity that it pa&s;&s;es through the in&s;ect
almo&s;t unchanged; &s;ee Sect. XIV. 1. 7. and 3. 2; and thus
cau&s;es the &s;uffu&s;ion of honey on the leaves below them for a time
in the heat of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Add to this that M. Du Hamel, by nicely mea&s;uring &s;ome
buds, found that they were gradually enlarged at &s;ome times
daring the winter, and concludes from thence that the &s;ap-juice,
which nouri&s;hes them, continues to flow, though &s;lowly, in the
milder parts of the winter days, Vol. II. p. 262; and adds, that
is mu&s;t ri&s;e continually during the winter months in ever-green
<PB N="33" REF="39">
trees, otherwi&s;e their foliage would wither; and al&s;o in deci|duous
trees, becau&s;e the branch of an ever-green tree will grow
on a deciduous tree, and not lo&s;e its leaves in the winter, as the
lauro-cera&s;us on a cherry-tree, and an ever-green oak on a com|mon
oak.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be ob&s;erved, that as the umbilical ve&s;&s;els
are a part of the new bud, as the lacteals and other ab&s;orbents
are a part of the chick or fetus, the perpetual action of the&s;e
umbilical ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t depend on the bud to which they belong,
in the caudex of which, between the plumula and radicle, the
brain or common &s;en&s;orium, and the con&s;equent vital energy,
are believed to re&s;ide; and that whether an ingraftment exi&s;ts
between the bud and the umbilical ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els or not. But
as in tho&s;e animals which have a very &s;mall portion of brain in
the head compared with that in the &s;pine of the back, as in eels,
&s;nakes, worms, butterflies, if the head be cut off, the other parts
will continue to live with great activity for hours, and even
days; &s;o it happens to the&s;e umbilical ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which in
vine-&s;tumps, and many herbaceous plants, will continue to pour
out the &s;ap-juice in great force and great quantity for many days
after the ex&s;ection of the whole upper part of the plant.</P>
<P>The continuance of the motion of the&s;e umbilical ve&s;&s;els con|&s;i&s;ting
of a &s;piral line, which are believed to be air ve&s;&s;els by many
authors, is mentioned by Malpighi; who a&s;&s;erts, that when he
examined them in the winter, he could often ob&s;erve them for
&s;ome time to continue their vermicular motion &s;o as to a&s;toni&s;h
him. See Duhamel. Phy&s;. des arb. Vol. I. p. 43.</P>
<P>9. The umbilical ve&s;&s;els of this &s;ection like the ab&s;orbents of
the preceding one, both which are believed to con&s;i&s;t of a &s;piral
line, as &s;hewn in Sect. II. 7. may be readily &s;een in cutting a
vine-&s;talk horizontally, as they at fir&s;t appear full of fluid; but
in a very little time, as the fluid exhales or becomes effu&s;ed, a
circular area of round holes appears to pa&s;s longitudinally interior
in re&s;pect to the bark; which I &s;uppo&s;e to con&s;i&s;t both of the
umbilical ve&s;&s;els, which bleed during the vernal months, and of
the other radical, cellular, and cutaneous ab&s;orbents; the latter
of which I &s;u&s;pect to be exterior to the former, and to re&s;ide
<PB N="34" REF="40">
between the bark and the umbilical ve&s;&s;els, though both of them
are believed to con&s;titute the alburnum of the plant.</P>
<P>From many ingenious ob&s;ervations on vegetables mon&s;ieur de
la Bai&s;&s;e draws the following conclu&s;ions, which are a&s;&s;ented to
by M. Bonnet, and which I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe, as they &s;o ac|curately
coincide with the theory above delivered, and as they
were deduced from different experiments, are a confirmation of
it. He &s;ays, &startq;that the ve&s;&s;els de&s;tined to convey nouri&s;hment
to plants, are neither in the pith, nor in the bark, nor between
the bark and the wood; but in the ligneous &s;ub&s;tance it&s;elf; or,
to &s;peak more accurately, that tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els are them&s;elves the
woody fibres included between the pith and the bark of plants,
which have their origin in the roots, and extend them&s;elves to
every part of the plant.&endq; Bonnet u&s;age des feuilles, p. 275.</P>

<P>I. 1. THERE have been various opinions concerning the u&s;e
of the leaves of plants in the vegetable economy. Some have
<PB N="36" REF="42">
contended, that they are per&s;piratory organs. This does not ap|pear
probable from an experiment of Dr. Hales, Veg. Stat. p.
30. He found, by cutting off branches of trees with apples on
them, and taking off the leaves, that an apple exhaled about as
much as two leaves, the &s;urfaces of which were nearly equal to
that of the apple; whence it would appear that apples have as
good a claim to be termed per&s;piratory organs as leaves.</P>
<P>Others have believed them the excretory organs of excrement|titious
juices; but as the vapour exhaled from vegetables has no
ta&s;te, this idea is no more probable than the other. Add to this,
that in moi&s;t weather they do not appear to per&s;pire or exhale at
all, as &s;hewn by &s;ome &s;tatical experiments of Dr. Hales, like
tho&s;e of Sanctorius on the per&s;piration of the human body; which
per&s;piration has al&s;o been &s;uppo&s;ed to be an excrement, which
is &s;hewn to be an erroneous opinion; and that its de&s;ign is &s;imply to
pre&s;erve the &s;kin &s;upple, like the tears diffu&s;ed on the eye-ball to
pre&s;erve its tran&s;parency, as explained in Zoonomia, Vol. II.
Cla&s;s I. 1, 2, 14.</P>
<P>Others have believed that vegetables ab&s;orb much nutriment
by their leaves, and quote an experiment of Dr. Prie&s;tley's, who
found plants placed in water under gla&s;&s;es grew much fa&s;ter,
when the air, in which they grew, was occasionally impregnated
with putrid exhalations. But there is another experiment of
Dr. Prie&s;tley's, which &s;hould be mentioned, and that is that he
agitated one part of a ve&s;&s;el of water beneath a gla&s;s filled with
putrid exhalation, and the whole of the water pre&s;ently became
very fetid. Hence we may conclude, that in the fir&s;t ca&s;e the
water, in which the vegetable grew, ab&s;orbed the putrid exhala|tions
from the air over it, and that the&s;e were again ab&s;orbed
from the water by the roots of vegetables, which corre&s;pond
to the lacteals of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines of animals; and that
they thus received nouri&s;hment from the putrid vapours, and not
by their leaves, which we &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew to be &s;imply
re&s;piratory organs.</P>
<P>Other philo&s;ophers have conceived, that the leaves of plants
acquire electricity from the air. In an&s;wer to the&s;e it may be
ob&s;erved, that no electricity is &s;hew by experiments to de&s;cend
through the &s;tems of trees, except in thunder &s;torms: and that
<PB N="37" REF="43">
if the final cau&s;e of vegetable leaves had been to conduct elec|tricity
from the air, they ought to have been gilded leaves
with metallic &s;tems.</P>
<P>Others again have &s;uppo&s;ed that the leaves of plants acquire a
phlogi&s;tic material from the &s;un's light, whence it was believed
that on this account they turn their upper &s;urfaces to the &s;un. But
though light is more or le&s;s attracted by all opake bodies, yet if
the final cau&s;e of vegetable leaves had been to ab&s;orb light, they
ought to have been black and not green; as by Dr. Franklin's
experiment, who laid &s;hreds of various colours on &s;now in the
&s;un-&s;hine, the black &s;unk much deeper than any other colour, and
con&s;equently ab&s;orbed much more light. The u&s;e of light in
vegetable re&s;piration will be treated, of in Sect. XIII.</P>
<P>2. The air of our atmo&s;phere has been &s;hewn by the experi|ments
of Prie&s;tley, Cavendi&s;h, and Lavoi&s;ier, to con&s;i&s;t of twen|ty-&s;even
parts of re&s;pirable air, called oxygene gas, with &s;eventy-three
parts of unre&s;pirable air, termed azotic, gas, which are
mixed together, not chemically combined; whereas water con|&s;i&s;ts
of eighty-five hundreth parts of oxygen to fifteen of hydro|gen,
which exi&s;t in their &s;tate of combination, and are not there|fore
fit for re&s;piration. But in water a con&s;iderable quantity of
common air is al&s;o di&s;&s;olved which e&s;capes on boiling; and even
pure vital air was di&s;covered in the water of &s;ome &s;prings by &s;ir
Benj. Thom&s;on, when it was expo&s;ed to the &s;un's light. Philo|&s;oph.
Tran&s;act. The former of the&s;e fluids is thus adapted to the
re&s;piration of aerial animals, and the latter to that of aquatic
ones; and the analogy between the aerial and aquatic leaves of
vegetables and the lungs and gills of animals embraces &s;o many
circum&s;tances, that we can &s;carcely withhold our a&s;&s;ent to their
performing &s;imilar offices.</P>
<P>The internal &s;urface of the air-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs of men are
&s;aid to be equal to the external &s;urface of the whole body, or
about fifteen &s;quare feet. On this &s;urface the blood is expo&s;ed
to the influence of the re&s;pired air, through the medium of a
thin moi&s;t pellicle. By this expo&s;ure to the air it has its colour
changed from deep red to a bright &s;carlet, and acquires &s;ome|thing
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of life, that we can live
&s;carely a minute without this wonderful proce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="44">
In aquatic animals, as fi&s;h, the blood is expo&s;ed to the air,
which is diffu&s;ed in the water by the gills; the &s;urface of which
is probably greater in proportion to the external &s;urface of their
bodies, than that of the air-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs of aerial animals
to their external &s;urfaces. Through the&s;e gills, or aquatic lungs,
a current of water is made perpetually to pa&s;s by the gaping of
the fi&s;h, as it moves, like the air in re&s;piration; and from this
water it is probable the &s;ame material is acquired by the gills of
fi&s;h as from the air by the lungs of aerial animals.</P>
<P>3. The great $$rface of the leaves compared to that of the
trunk and branches of trees is &s;uch, that it would &s;eem to be an
organ well adapted for the purpo&s;e of expo&s;ing the vegetable
juices to the influence of the air. This however we &s;hall &s;ee
afterwards is probably performed only by their upper &s;urfaces,
which are expo&s;ed to the light as well as air, and on that ac|count
$$quire greater oxygenation, as will be &s;hewn hereafter:
yet even in this ca&s;e the upper &s;urfaces of the leaves mu&s;t bear a
greater proportion to the &s;urface of the bark of the tree than that
of $he air-cells of the lungs of animals to their external &s;urfaces.</P>
<P>Aerial or aquatic animals, by their mu&s;cular exertions, produce
a current of air or water reciprocally to and from their lungs,
and can occa&s;ionally change the place, where they re&s;pire, when
the air or water becomes vitiated. But as vegetables have but
little mu&s;cular power to move their leaves, except in a few in|&s;tances;
and as the air or water is frequently nearly &s;tationary,
where they exi&s;t, it &s;eems to have been nece&s;&s;ary to expo&s;e their
fluids to the air or water on a greater expan&s;e of &s;urface than in
the lungs or gills of animals, which well accounts for the exube|rant
extent of their foliage.</P>
<P>In the lungs of animals the blood, after having been expo&s;ed
to the air in the extremities of the pulmonary artery, is changed
in colour from deep red to bright &s;carlet, and is then collected
and returned by the pulmonary vein. So in the leaves of plants
the vegetable blood is rendered yellow in &s;ome plants, as in ce|landine,
chelidonium; white in others, as in fig-leaves, ficus;
and in &s;purge, euphorbia; and red in others, as in red beets,
beta. And the &s;tructure of the leaf, as con&s;i&s;ting of arteries
and veins to expo&s;e the vegetable blood to the influence of the
<PB N="39" REF="45">
air, and to return it to the caudex of the bud at the foot-&s;talk
of the leaf, beautifully became vi&s;ible by the following expe|riment.</P>
<P>A &s;talk with the leaves and &s;eed-ve&s;&s;els of large &s;purge (eu|phorbia
helio&s;copia) in June 1791, had been &s;everal days placed
in a decoction of madder, (rubia tincto$ia) &s;o that the lower
part of the &s;tem and two of the inferior le$ves were immer&s;ed in
it. After having wa&s;hed the immer&s;ed leaves in much clean
water, I could readily di&s;cern the colour of the madder pa&s;&s;ing
along the middle rib of each leaf. This red artery was beaut$|fully
vi&s;ible both in the under and upper &s;urfa$e of the leaf;
but on the upper &s;ide many red branches were &s;e$n going from
it to the extremities of $$e leaf, which on the other &s;ide were
not vi&s;ible except by looking through it again&s;t the light. On
this under &s;ide a &s;y&s;tem of branching ve&s;&s;els carrying a pale
milky fluid, were &s;een coming from the extremities of the leaf,
and covering the whole under&s;ide of it, and joining int$$ two
large veins, one on each &s;ide of the red artery in the middle rib
of the leaf, and along with it de&s;cending to the foot-&s;talk or $e|tiole.
On &s;litting one of the&s;e leaves with &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and having&punc;
a common magnifying lens ready, the milky blood was &s;een
oozing out of the returning vein on each &s;ide of the red artery
in the middle rib, but none of the red fluid from the artery.</P>
<P>All the&s;e appearances were more ea&s;ily &s;een in a leaf of picris
treated in the &s;ame manner; for in this milky plant the &s;tems and
middle-rib of the leaves are &s;ometimes naturally coloured reddi&s;h,
and hence the colour of the madder &s;eemed to pa&s;s further into
the rami&s;ications of their leaf-arteries, and was there beautifully
vi&s;ible with the returning branches of milky veins on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>In a plant which was &s;ent to me under the name of &s;enecio
bicolor, but which I have not yet &s;een in flower, the upper &s;ur|face
of the leaf is green like mo&s;t other leaves, but during the
vernal months the under &s;urface is of a deep red, whence I con|clude
that the vegetable blood acquires the red colour in the ter|minations
of the pulmonary artery in the upper &s;urfaces of the
leaves, which becomes vi&s;ible as it pa&s;&s;es in the large veins on the
inferior &s;urface. In the &s;ame manner the red colour of the blood
<PB N="40" REF="46">
is mo&s;t vi&s;ible in the large veins beneath the leaf of the red
veined dock, rumex &s;anguirea.</P>
<P>4. From the&s;e experiments the upper &s;urface of the leaf ap|peared
to be the immediate organ of re&s;piration, becau&s;e the co|loured
fluid was carried to the extremities of the leaf by ve&s;&s;els
mo&s;t con&s;picuous on the upper &s;urface, and there changed into a
milky fluid which is $$$e blood of the plant, and then returned by
concomitant veins a$ the under &s;urface, which were &s;een to ooze
when divided wit$ &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and which in picris particularly ren|dered
the under &s;urface of the leaves greatly whiter than the up|per
one.</P>
<P>As the up$er &s;urface of leaves con&s;titutes the organ of re&s;pi|ration,
on $hich the vegetable blood is expo&s;ed in the termina|tions
of a $eries beneath a thin moi&s;t pellicl$ to the action of the
atmo&s;ph$re, the&s;e &s;urfaces in many plants &s;trongly repel moi&s;ture,
as cab$$ge-leaves, whence the particles of rain lying over their
&s;urfa$ces without touching them, as ob&s;erved by Mr. Melville,
(F&s;ays Literary and Philo&s;. Edinb.) have the appearance of
$$bules of quick-&s;ilver. And hence leaves laid with their up|per
&s;urfaces on water wither as &s;oon as in the dry air, but con|tinue
green many days if placed with their under &s;urfaces on
water, as appears in the experiment of mon&s;ieur Bonnet, (U&s;age
des Feuilles); hence &s;ome aquatic plants, as the water-lily
(nymphaea) have the lower &s;ides of their leaves floating on the
water, while the upper &s;urfaces remain dry in the air.</P>
<P>This repul&s;ion of the upper &s;urfaces of the leaves of aerial
plants to water bears &s;ome analogy to the renitency of the lariynx
to the admi&s;&s;ion of water into the lungs of animals; for if a &s;in|gle
drop accidentally falls into the windpipe, a convul&s;ive cough
is induced till it is regurgitated. For the &s;ame rea&s;on &s;everal plants
clo&s;e together the upper &s;urfaces of their leaves when it rains, in
the &s;ame manner as in their &s;leep during the night, as mimo&s;a,
the &s;en&s;itive plant, and the young &s;hoots of chick-weed, al&s;ine;
and of kidney-bean, pha&s;eolus.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e in&s;ects which have many &s;piracula, or breathing
apertures, as wa&s;ps and flies, are immediately &s;uffocated by
pouring oil upon them, in the year 1783 I carefully covered with
oil the &s;urfaces of &s;everal leaves of phlomis, of Portugal laurel,
<PB N="41" REF="47">
and bal&s;ams; and though it would not regularly adhere, I found
them all die in a day or two, which &s;hews another &s;imilitude be|tween
the lungs of animals and the leaves of vegetables.</P>
<P>There is an ingenious experiment of M. Bonnet, (U&s;age des
f&s;euilles) which &s;hews that the upper &s;urfaces of leaves exhale
much le&s;s than their under &s;urfaces. He put the &s;talks of many
leaves fre&s;h plucked from trees or herbaceous plants into gla&s;s
tubes filled with water; of the&s;e he covered with oil or varni&s;h
the upper &s;urface of many leaves, and the under &s;urface of many
others, and uniformly ob&s;erved by the water &s;inking in the tubes
that the upper &s;urfaces exhaled much le&s;s than half the quantity
exhaled by the under &s;urfaces, which &s;hews them to be organs
de&s;igned for different purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>II. 1. There exi&s;ts a &s;trict analogy between the leaves of aqua|tic
plants, which are con&s;tantly immer&s;ed beneath the water, and
the gills of aquatic animals, which, con&s;i&s;ts in the largene&s;s of
their &s;urface, owing to their hair-like &s;ubdivi&s;ions, and to their
being terminated with innumerable points. The gills of fi&s;h con|&s;i&s;t
of many folds of blood-ve&s;&s;els lying over each other, each re|&s;embling
a fringe, or the downy part on one &s;ide of a feather at|tached
to the middle rib of it, by which means they expo&s;e a
greater &s;urface of blood to the water than is expo&s;ed to the air by
the internal membranes of the air-cells of the lungs of other ani|mals;
and undoubtedly for this final cau&s;e, becau&s;e water con|tains
le&s;s oxygen in its uncombined &s;tate, which is the material
nece&s;&s;ary to life, than air, though much more of it in its com|bined
&s;tate, as water con&s;i&s;ts of eighty-five parts of oxygen to fif|teen
parts of hydrogen; but it is the uncombined oxygen only
di&s;&s;olved in heat, and diffu&s;ed in water, which can &s;erve the pur|po&s;e
of animal or vegetable re&s;piration.</P>
<P>The apparatus for this purpo&s;e, according to Duverney's Ana|tomy
of a Carp, is truly curious. He found 4386 bones in the
gills, which had &s;ixty-nine mu&s;cles to give them their due motions.
See Bomare's Dictionnai$e rai&s;one&eacute;, Art Poi&s;&s;on. And Mon|ro
ob&s;erved by the numerous divi&s;ions and folds of the membrane
of the gills, that their &s;urface in a large &s;kate was nearly equal
to the &s;urface of the human body. Phy&s;iol. of Fi&s;h, p. 15. He
adds that in the whole gills there exi&s;t 144,000 &s;ubdivi&s;ions or
<PB N="42" REF="48">
folds, and that the whole extent of this membrane may be &s;een
by a micro&s;cope to be covered with a network of exceedingly
minute ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>2. In this re&s;pect the gills of fi&s;h are re&s;embled by the &s;uba|quatic
leaves of plants, which are &s;lit into long wires terminated
in points, as in traps, oenanthe, hottonia, the water-violet, and
the water-ranuncules. This la&s;t plant, and &s;ome others, have
frequently &s;ome leaves erect in the air, and others immer&s;ed in
water, ari&s;ing from the &s;ame &s;tem; and it is curious to ob&s;erve
that the aerial leaves are nearly entire, or divided only into a
few lobes; vnil&s;t the aquatic leaves are &s;lit into innumerable
branches lik$ a fringe, and have thus their &s;urfaces wonderfully
enlarged for the purpo&s;e of acquiring uncombined oxygen from
the air, which is diffu&s;ed in the water, and which abounds &s;o
much le&s;s there than in the atmo&s;phere; for the &s;ame purpo&s;e
the plants on the &s;ummits of high mountains, where the air is &s;o
much rarer, and con&s;equently abounds le&s;s with oxygen, have
their leaves much more divided than in the plains, as pimpinella,
petro&s;elinum, and others, that they may expo&s;e a more exten&s;ive
&s;urface of ve&s;&s;els to the influence of the thinner atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>3. This great enlargement of the &s;urface by &s;o minute a divi|&s;ion
does not however &s;eem to be the only u&s;e of this uniform
&s;tructure of gills and aquatic leaves; but there is another very
important one, which hath hitherto I believe e&s;caped the notice
of philo&s;ophers; and that is that points and edges contribute
much to the &s;eparation of the air, which is mechanically mixed
or chemically di&s;&s;olved in water, as appears on immer&s;ing a dry
hairy leaf into water fre&s;h from a pump, on which innumerable
globules of air, like quick-&s;ilver, appear on almo&s;t every point.
Nor is it improbable that points immer&s;ed in water may in a
bright day contribute to decompo&s;e it, or certainly to &s;et at liberty
its &s;uperabundant oxygene, as occurs in the per&s;piration of leaves
when expo&s;ed to the &s;un&s;hine, and to the green matter in the
experiments of Dr. Prie&s;tley, which is probably owing to the
fine points of both of them; and la&s;tly, when points of &s;ilk are
immer&s;ed in &s;pring water, which is frequently hyperoxygenated, as
in the experiments of Count Rumford, related in the Philo&s;.
Tran&s;act. See Sect. XIII. I. 5.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="49">
III. 1. The <HI>root-leaves</HI> of many perennial plants, which do not
produce flowers in the fir&s;t year from the &s;eed, are different from
tho&s;e of future years, as in the rheum palmatum, palmated rhu|barb,
the leaves are &s;mall and nearly circular, and not divided into
fingers till the &s;econd year; and in tulip the leaf the fir&s;t year
from the &s;eed is &s;mall like a blade of gra&s;s ri&s;ing from a diminu|tive
bulb. In other perennial plants the root-leaf is undivided,
but at the &s;ame time larger than tho&s;e on the ri&s;ing &s;tem, as in
geum, averns; in &s;enecio aureus, and the campanula rotundi&s;o|lia,
&s;o named from the round form of the root-leaf, which is
al&s;o much broader than tho&s;e on the &s;tem, as well as undivided.
The root-leaves of many biennial, and of &s;ome annual plants,
are likewi&s;e larger, as well as of a different form from tho&s;e on
the ri&s;ing flower-&s;tem, as in turneps and carrots. And la&s;tly, the
root-leaves of &s;ome plants, which ri&s;e immediately from &s;eeds,
con&s;i&s;t of the cotyledons of the &s;eed, and are thus different from
the leaves above them.</P>
<P>2. In re&s;pect to the root-leaves of palmated rhubarb and of tu|lips,
when the&s;e plants are rai&s;ed immediately from &s;eed, as the&s;e
fir&s;t plants are not de&s;igned to generate flowers and con&s;equent
&s;eeds, but to produce &s;imply another plant like a leaf-bud of a
tree, le&s;s oxygenation &s;eems to have been nece&s;&s;ary, and the
leaves therefore require le&s;s &s;urface, and are in con&s;equence un|divided.
In re&s;pect to the root-leaves of geum, and of campa|nula
rotundifolia, which are larger than their &s;tem-leaves, it is
probable that they lay up a re&s;ervoir of nutritious matter for the
ri&s;ing &s;tem, like tho&s;e of turneps and carrots, and thus require
greater oxygenation, and in con&s;equence a greater &s;urface.</P>
<P>3. Another difference of root-leaves from tho&s;e of the &s;tem in
annual plants often con&s;i&s;ts in the latter being properly bractes or
floral-leaves, which will be &s;poken of below, while the root-leaf
re&s;embles tho&s;e belonging to the leaf-buds of trees. Thus in the
ri&s;ing &s;tem of wheat the root-leaf produces the fir&s;t joint above
the &s;oil, and the &s;econd and third leaf produce joint above joint,
which are each a &s;eparate bud ri&s;ing on that below it, as is &s;een
by the divi&s;ion of the pith or hollow part of one joint from ano|ther,
and at length die uppermo&s;t leaf is a bracte or floral-leaf
belonging to the ear.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50">
4. And la&s;tly, the &s;eed-leaves which ri&s;e out of the ground
with the fir&s;t joint of the flower-&s;tem, as in kidney bean, pha&s;e|olus,
as they con&s;i&s;t of the placental artery, which was &s;pread on
the cotyledons of the &s;eed, and, now ri&s;ing out of the earth,
when the nutritive part has been di&s;&s;olved in the terrein moi&s;ture
and ab&s;orbed, they &s;erve the office of an aerial pulmonary organ,
or lungs, which before &s;erved that of an aquatic one, or gills;
but wither and fall off as the true leaves become expanded.</P>
<P>IV. 1. The common foliage of deciduous plants con&s;titutes
the organ of re&s;piration already &s;poken of, which belongs to the
leaf-buds during the &s;ummer months, and drops off in the autumn,
when tho&s;e buds peri&s;h by the cold, or by the natural termination
of their exi&s;tence. But there is another kind of foliage di&s;&s;imilar
to the former, con&s;i&s;ting of bractes or floral-leaves, which &s;upply
an organ of re&s;piration to the calyx and pericarp of the flower-bud.
The&s;e frequently differ in &s;ize, form, and colour from the
other leaves of the plant, and are &s;ituated on the flower-&s;talk
often &s;o near the fructification as to be confounded with the
calyx. In &s;ome plants there are two &s;ets of floral-leaves, or
bractes, one at the foot of the umbel, and another beneath each
di&s;tinct floret of it; and in others they appear in a tuft above the
flower, as well as on the &s;talk beneath it, as in fritillaria impe|rialis,
crown imperial; and in others they are &s;o &s;mall as to be
termed &s;tipulae or props.</P>
<P>All the&s;e kinds of bractes, or floral-leaves, &s;erve the office of
lungs for the purpo&s;e of expo&s;ing the vegetable blood to the in|fluence
of the air, and of preparing it for the &s;ecretion, or produc|tion
and nouri&s;hment of the vegetable uterus, or pericarp, and of
the &s;eeds produced and retained in it, frequently before their im|pregnation,
and always after it.</P>
<P>2. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that in many plants the&s;e floral-leaves,
or bractes do not appear till after the corol and nectaries, with
the anthers and &s;tigmas, drop off; that is, not till after the &s;eed
is impregnated, as in colchicum autumnale, crocus, hamam$lis,
and in &s;ome fruit-trees. The production of the vegetable uterus,
or pericarp, with the unimpregnated &s;eeds included in it, is in
the&s;e plants accompli&s;hed or evolved, like the bractes them&s;elves
with the corol and &s;exual organs, by the &s;ap-juice, forced up in the
<PB N="45" REF="51">
umbilical ve&s;&s;els from &s;ome previou&s;ly prepared re&s;ervoir, without
the nece&s;&s;ity of any expo&s;ition to the air in leaves or lungs, which
are not yet formed, though it may acquire oxygenation in the fine
arteries of the embryon buds, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;urround the
horizontal air-ve&s;&s;els ob&s;erved in the bark of trees.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;eeds become impregnated, the corol and nec|taries
with the &s;exual organs fall off, and the pericarp and its con|tained
&s;eeds are then nouri&s;hed by the blood, which is aerated
or oxygenated in the bractes, or floral-leaves. Thus the flower
of the colchicum appears in autumn without any green leaves, and
the pericarp with its impregnated &s;eeds ri&s;es out of the ground
in the en&s;uing &s;pring on a &s;tem &s;urrounded with bractes, and with
other green leaves below them, which produce new bulbs in
their bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>The blood, which thus &s;upplies nutriment to the pericarp and
its included &s;eeds, does not &s;eem to require &s;o much oxygena|tion
as that which &s;upplies nutriment to the embryon buds;
whence the floral leaves are in general much le&s;s than the root-leaves
in many plants, and than the common green leaves of al|mo&s;t
all vegetables. And in the plant mentioned in No. I. 3.
of this &s;ection, under the name of &s;enecio bicolor, the under
&s;urfaces of the &s;tem-leaves near the expected flower cea&s;ed to be
red like tho&s;e of the radical leaves, which &s;eemed to &s;hew that
the vegetable blood was in them le&s;s oxygenated.</P>
<P>Whence it may be believed that le&s;s irritability may be nece&s;&s;ary
for the growth of the &s;eed than of the embryon bud, as the
former does not yet perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much vegetable life as the
latter. And la&s;tly, that as the anthers and &s;tigma require greater
irritability, and &s;ome &s;en&s;ibility, it was nece&s;&s;ary a &s;econd time
to oxygenate the blood which &s;upplies them with nutriment in the
corols of the flowers. See Sect. VII. 2. 4.</P>
<P>3. Recapitulation of the arguments tending to &s;hew that the
leaves of vegetables are their lungs. 1. They con&s;i&s;t of an artery,
which carries the &s;ap to the extreme &s;urface of the upper &s;ide of the
leaf, and there expo&s;es it under a thin moi&s;t pellicle to the
action of the air; and of veins, which there collect and return
it to the foot-&s;talk of the leaf, like the pulmonary &s;y&s;tem of ani|mals.
2. In this organ the pellucid &s;ap is changed to a coloured
<PB N="46" REF="52">
blood, like the chyle in pa&s;&s;ing through the lungs of animals.
3. The leaves of aquatic plants are furni&s;hed with a larger &s;urface,
and with points like the gills of aquatic animals. 4. The up|per
&s;ides of aerial leaves repel moi&s;ture, like the larynx of ani|mals.
5. Leaves are killed by &s;mearing them with oil, which in
the &s;ame manner de&s;troys in&s;ects by &s;topping their &s;piracula, or
the air-holes to their lungs. 6. Leaves have mu&s;cles appro|priated
to turn them to the light, which is nece&s;&s;ary to their re&s;|piration,
as will be &s;hewn in the Section on Light. 7. To this
may be added an experiment of Mr. Papin related by M. Duha|mel.
He put an intire plant into the exhau&s;ted receiver of an air-pump,
and it &s;oon peri&s;hed; but on keeping the whole plant in
this vacuum except the leaves, which were expo&s;ed to the air, it
continued to live a long time, which he adds is a proof that
the leaves are the organs of re&s;piration. Phy&s;ic des arbres, V.
I. p. 169.</P>
<P>V. 1. The organs of re&s;piration already de&s;cribed con&s;i&s;t of
the green leaves belonging to leaf-buds, and of the bractes belong|ing
to flower-buds. But there is another pulmonary &s;y&s;tem to|tally
independent of the green foliage, which belongs to the
&s;exual or amatorial parts of the fructification only, I mean the
corol or petals. In this there is an artery belonging to each
petal, which conveys the vegetable blood to its extremities, ex|po&s;ing
it to the light and air under a delicate moi&s;t membrane
covering the internal &s;urface of the petal, where it often changes
its colour, as is beautifully &s;een in &s;ome party-coloured poppies,
though it is probable that &s;ome of the irride&s;cent colours of
flowers may be owing to the different degrees of tenuity of the
exterior membrane of the petal refracting the light like &s;oap|bubbles.</P>
<P>The vegetable blood is then collected at the extremities of the
corol-arteries, and returned by corre&s;pondent veins exactly as
in the green foliage, for the &s;u&s;tenance of the anthers and &s;tig|mas,
and for the important &s;ecretions of honey, wax, e&s;&s;entail
oil, and the prolific du&s;t of the anthers, and thus con&s;titutes a
pulmonary organ, as is &s;hewn by the following analogies.</P>
<P>2. Fir&s;t, the va&s;cular &s;tructure of the corol, as above de&s;cribed,
and which is vi&s;ible to the naked eye; and its expo&s;ing the ve|getable
<PB N="47" REF="53">
juices to the air and light during the day evinces that it
is a pulmonary organ.</P>
<P>Secondly, as the glands which produce the prolific du&s;t of the
anthers, the honey, wax, and frequently &s;ome odoriferous e&s;|&s;entail
oil, are generally attached to the corol, and always fall off
and peri&s;h with it, it is evident that the blood is elaborated or
oxygenated in this pulmonary &s;y&s;tem for the purpo&s;e of the&s;e im|portent
&s;ecretions.</P>
<P>Thirdly, many flowers, as the colchicum and hamamelis,
ari&s;e naked in autumn, no green leaves appearing till the en&s;uing
&s;pring; and many others put forth their flowers, and complete
their impregnation early in the &s;pring, before the green foliage
or bractes appear, as mezereon, and &s;ome fruit-trees, which
&s;hews that the&s;e corols are the lungs belonging to the&s;e parts of
the fructification.</P>
<P>Fourthly, this organ does not &s;eem to have been nece&s;&s;ary for
the defence of the &s;tamens and pi&s;tils, &s;ince the calyx of many
flowers, as tragopogon, performs this office; and in many flowers
the&s;e petals them&s;elves are &s;o tender as to require being &s;hut up
in the calyx during the night. For what other u&s;e then can &s;uch
an apparatus of ve&s;&s;els be de&s;igned?</P>
<P>Fifthly, in the helleborus niger, Chri&s;tmas-ro&s;e, after the &s;eeds
are grown to a certain &s;ize, the nectaries, and &s;tamens, and &s;tig|mas,
drop off, and the beautiful large white petals change their
colour to a deep green, and gradually thus become a calyx, in|clo&s;ing
and defending the ripening &s;eeds; hence it would &s;eem that
the white ve&s;&s;els of the corol &s;erved the office of expo&s;ing the
blood to the action of the air, for the purpo&s;es of &s;eparating or
producing the honey, wax, and prolific du&s;t; and when the&s;e
were no longer wanted, that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els coale&s;ced, like the
umbilical ve&s;&s;els of animals after their birth, and thus cea&s;ed to
perform that office, and lo&s;t at the &s;ame time their white colour.
Why &s;hould they lo&s;e their white colour unle&s;s they at the &s;ame
time lo&s;t &s;ome other property be&s;ides that of defending the &s;eed-ve&s;&s;el,
which they &s;till continue to defend?</P>
<P>Sixthly, neither the common green leaves nor the bractes are
nece&s;&s;ary to the progre&s;s of the carol, and &s;tamens, and &s;tigma,
or to the &s;ecretion of honey, after the la&s;t year's leaves are fallen
off, as is evinced by the flowers of colchicum in the autumn, and
<PB N="48" REF="54">
of crocus in the &s;pring, in both which the &s;eeds ri&s;e out of the
earth with their common leaves and bractes &s;o long after the di&s;|appearance
of the flower. In deciduous plants the common
green leaves &s;erve as lungs in the &s;ummer and autumn to each in|dividual
bud, which then produces the new buds in its bo&s;om,
which are either leaf-buds or flower-buds. In the en&s;uing &s;pring
the new common leaves are the re&s;piratory organ belonging to
the leaf-buds, and the bractes are the re&s;piratory organ to the
pericarp, and its included &s;eeds before or after impregnation;
and the corols, as &s;oon as expanded, become the lungs to the
amatorial parts of the fructification, and require neither the green
leaves nor bractes.</P>
<P>3. Hence the vine bears fruit at one joint without leaves, and
leaves at the other joint without fruit. Hence the flower of the
colchicum ri&s;es out of the ground without bractes or other green
leaves, and flouri&s;hes till the &s;eed is impregnated; and the brac|tes,
which ri&s;e out of the ground on the &s;tem in the following
&s;pring, are lungs to give maturity to the pericarp and &s;eed; and the
other green leaves are for the purpo&s;e of producing new bulbs
round the old one, but can have nothing to do with the corol, an|thers,
&s;tigmas, and nectaries, which have long &s;ince fallen off,
and peri&s;hed. And la&s;tly, when currant or goo&s;eberry trees lo&s;e
their common green leaves, and their bractes, by the depreda|tion
of in&s;ects; the new leaf-buds become &s;mall and weak, but the
corol, anthers, &s;tigmas, and nectaries, continue to flouri&s;h, and the
fruit becomes impregnated, though it is le&s;s &s;weet and of le&s;s &s;ize
from the pericarp and included &s;eed wanting their due nutrition
by the bractes before or after impregnation.</P>
<P>4. It hence appears that the flower-bud, after the corol, &s;ta|mens,
&s;tigmas, and nectaries fall off, becomes &s;imply a vegetable
uterus, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying the growing embryons with
nouri&s;hment, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;y&s;tem of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which
brings the &s;ap-juice to the foot-&s;talk of the fruit, and which there
changes into a pulmonary artery, which con&s;titutes the bractes
or floral-leaves, and expo&s;es the acquired juices to the oxygena|tion
of the air, and converts them into vegetable blood. This
blood is collected again by the veins of the bractes, and con|veyed
by an adapted or aortal artery for the various &s;ecretions
of &s;accharine, farinaceous, or ace&s;cent materials, for the nourish-ment
<PB N="49" REF="55">
of its included embryons, or the con&s;truction of the fruit
and &s;eed-lobes.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, as perhaps all the ve&s;&s;els of trees ino&s;|culate,
the fruit may become &s;weeter and larger when the green
leaves as well as the bractes continue on the tree; but the corols
with the &s;tamens, &s;tigmas, and nectaries, (the &s;ucceeding fruit not
con&s;idered) &s;uffer, I believe no injury, when the green leaves and
even the bractes are taken off, as by the depredations of in&s;ects.
Some flori&s;ts have ob&s;erved this circum&s;tance, and affirm that in
many plants when the leaves are pulled off, the flowers become
&s;tronger from their then producing no bulbs, as in tulips and hya|cinths.
The ino&s;culation of vegetable ve&s;&s;els is evinced by the
increa&s;ed growth of one bud, when others in its vicinity are cut
away.</P>
<P>5. The &s;leep of plants has been much &s;poken of by Linneus
and others, but there is a wonderful circum&s;tance occurs in it,
which has not been noticed; which is, that it &s;eems to re&s;emble
the torpor of winter-&s;leeping in&s;ects and other animals, as many
plants do not appear to re&s;pire during this part of their exi&s;tence;
for &s;ome vegetables clo&s;e together the upper &s;urfaces of their
leaves, both during their &s;leep and in rainy weather, as mimo&s;a,
&s;en&s;itive-plant; pha&s;eolus, kidney-bean; and the terminal &s;hoots
of al&s;ine, chickweed. Many other plants clo&s;e their petals and
calyxes during their &s;leep as well as in rain, as convolvulus; and
&s;ome even in the bright day-light, as tragopogon; and yet all the&s;e
plants are believed by gardeners to grow, when young, fa&s;ter in the night.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that this &s;leep of plants, though it may re|&s;emble
the torpor of winter-&s;leeping animals, is not to be con|founded
with the &s;tate of deciduous plants in the winter, as that
con&s;i&s;ts in the death of the la&s;t year's bud, and the embryon con|dition
of the new buds. It would hence appear, that perpetual
re&s;piration is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to the vegetable than to the animal
world; and that as le&s;s is wa&s;ted during the inactive &s;tate of &s;leep,
it is po&s;&s;ible that young plants may increa&s;e in weight, or grow
fa&s;ter, during this &s;tate of inactivity, as animals are ob&s;erved to
re&s;pire le&s;s frequently during their &s;leep, and yet are believed
when young to grow fa&s;ter during their hours of re&s;t than of ex|erci&s;e.
<PB N="50" REF="56">
So both in the experiments of Dr. Hales and Dr. Walker on
plants during the bleeding &s;ea&s;on, the a&s;cent of the &s;ap-juice not
only &s;topped during the night, but &s;ometimes became retrograde,
which might neverthele&s;s be a&s;cribed to the torpor of the ab&s;or|bent
&s;y&s;tem induced by cold, as well as that of &s;leep.</P>
<P>6. We may draw this general re&s;ult, that the common leaves
of trees are the lungs of the individual vegetable beings, which
form during the &s;ummer new buds in their bo&s;oms, whether leaf-buds
or flower-buds, and which in re&s;pect to the deciduous trees
of this climate peri&s;h in autumn; while the new buds remain to
expand in the en&s;uing &s;pring. Secondly, that the bractes, or
floral-leaves, are the lungs of the pericarp or uterus, and to the
growing &s;eeds which it contains, as the bractes on the &s;tem of the
crown-unpenal, $word$ imperialis, and the tuft above its
flowers. And $word$, that the corol or petals are the lungs be|longing
to the $word$ and &s;tigmas, which are the &s;exual or ama|torial
parts of the plant, and to the neactries for the &s;ecretion of
honey, and to the other glands which affords e&s;&s;ential oil and
wax.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the &s;tamina and &s;tigma with the petals and nectary,
which con&s;titute the vegetable males, and the amatorial part of
the female, as they in &s;ome plants appear before the green leaves
or bractes, as in colchicum and mezereon, and in all plants fall off
when the female uterus is impregnated, would appear to be
di&s;tinct beings, totally different both from the leaf-buds, which produce
a viviparous progeny; and al&s;o from the bractes with
the calyx and pericarp, which con&s;titute the vegetable uterus.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t at fir&s;t receive nutriment from the vernal &s;ap-juice,
like the expanding foliage of the leaf-buds, or the bractes of the
flower-buds. But when the corol becomes expanded, and con|&s;titutes
a new pulmonary organ, the vegetable juices are expo&s;ed
to the air in the extremities of its fine arteries beneath a moi&s;t
pellicle for the purpo&s;e of greater oxygenation, and for the im|portent
&s;ecretion of honey; and then the anthers and &s;tigmas are
&s;upplied with this more nutritious food, which they ab&s;orb from
its receptacle, the nectary, after it has there been expo&s;ed to the
air, and are thus furni&s;hed with greater irritability, and with the
nece&s;&s;ary amatorial &s;en&s;ibility, and live like bees and butterflies on
that nutritious fluid. See Sect. VII. II. 4.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE AORTAL ARTERIES AND VEINS OF VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<Q>1. Aortal arteries in vegetables have corre&s;pondent veins. Shewn
by experiment on picris, tragopogon, and euphorbia. Seen in the
calyx of flowers. Circulation &s;hewn by ingrafting &s;triped-pa&s;&s;ion-flower,
and ja&s;mine, and hardier &s;cions on cankered &s;tems, from
fruit-grafts on bad &s;tocks degenerating. 2. Vegetable circulation
performed without a heart, as in the aorta and liver of fi&s;h.
3. Force of the mouths of ab&s;orbents greater than that of the heart
in producing circulation. Why there is no pul&s;ation in the vena
portarum. Circulation in the veins of animals produced by ab|&s;orption.
Very &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance in the capillaries and glands.
Wounds in trees &s;trongly ab&s;orb fluids except in the bleeding &s;ea&s;on.
4. Vegetable ve&s;&s;els too minute to carry red blood, hence not ea&s;ily
injected with coloured fluids. Charcoal injected with quick&s;ilver,
or melted wax. 5. Recapitulation. Circulation performed by
irritability of the ve&s;&s;els, and by the great power of ab&s;orption,
and the action of the &s;ides of ve&s;&s;els con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;piral line.
6. Ve&s;&s;els unite at the lower and upper caudex gemmae. Ab&s;or|bents
and umbilical ve&s;&s;els con&s;i&s;t of a &s;piral line. Experiment by
placing euphorbium fir&s;t in a decoction of galls, and then in a &s;olution
of green vitriol. Junction of great vein, ab&s;orbent trunk, and pul|monary
artery in the upper caudex gemmae. Embryon bud &s;een in
contact with the pith. Experiments with charcoal injected with
white paint, &s;uet; wax, and quick&s;ilver.</Q>
<P>1. THE two principal arteries in animal bodies are the pulmo|nary
artery and the aorta. The former receives the blood from
the right cavity of the heart, and di&s;per&s;ing it round all the air-cells
which terminate the bronchia, or air-pipes of the lungs, ex|po&s;es
it to the influence of the atmo&s;phere through the thin moi&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="58">
membrane, which lines them. This we have &s;hewn in Sect. IV.
I. 3. to be re&s;embled in its office by the vegetable arteries, which
carry their blood up the foot-&s;talks of the leaves, and expo&s;e it
on the upper &s;urface of them to the influence of the air through
a thin moi&s;t pellicle, where it changes its colour, and returns by
corre&s;pondent veins like the blood of animals.</P>
<P>The aortal arteries of the more perfect animals receive the
blood from the left cavity of the heart, after it has been expo&s;ed
to the influence of the air in the lungs, and di&s;per&s;e it by numer|ous
ramifications over the whole body for the purpo&s;es of &s;ecre|tion
and nutrition. In le&s;s perfect animals the aorta it&s;elf has a
pul&s;ation, and carries forward the blood without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
a heart, as may be &s;een in the back of a full-grown &s;ilk-worm by
the naked eye, and very di&s;tinctly by the u&s;e of a common lens.
After the blood has pa&s;&s;ed the various glands and capillaries, it
is received by another &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els, the veins, which con&s;ti|tute
a kind of re&s;ervoir for the quantity of blood, that remains un|expended
by the &s;ecretions, excretions, nutrition, and growth of
the animal; by the&s;e it is again carried to the right cavity of the
heart, and again expo&s;ed in the lungs to the influence of the air.</P>
<P>In a &s;imilar manner the branching veins, which bring the blood
from the leaves of plants, after it has been expo&s;ed to the in|fluence
of the air, unite at the foot-&s;talk of each leaf into more or
fewer trunks, as may be &s;een in tearing off the foot-&s;talk
of a leaf of a che&s;nut-tree from the &s;tem; and there without the interpo|&s;ition
of a heart, like the circulation in the aorta of fi&s;h, and that
in the livers of red-blooded animals, the&s;e venous trunks take
the office of arteries, and di&s;per&s;e the blood downwards along the
bark to the roots, and to every other part of the vegetable &s;y&s;|tem,
performing the various purpo&s;es of &s;ecretion, excretion, and
nutrition, as was &s;hewn in the experiment of placing a fig-leaf in
a decoction of madder, de&s;cribed in Sect. IV. 1. 3. of this
work.</P>
<P>But as vegetables drink up their adapted nouri&s;hment perpe|tually
from the moi&s;t earth, and in con&s;equence mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed
to take up no more than their perpetual wa&s;te may require, I
formerly believed, that this re&s;ervoir, or venous &s;y&s;tem, was not
<PB N="53" REF="59">
nece&s;&s;ary in vegetables; and that therefore probably it did not
exi&s;t. I was induced to adopt this idea from having ob&s;erved in
cutting a&s;under a &s;tem of large &s;purge, euphorbia helio&s;copia; in
which the ri&s;ing &s;ap could not be mi&s;taken for the milky blood;
that much more of the vegetable blood flowed from the upper part of the
plant than from the lower part of it; and I therefore
&s;u&s;pected, that there was no returning veins corre&s;pondent to the
de&s;cending aortal arteries. But fir&s;t; this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occur
from the veins returning from the root effu&s;ing their blood flower
than the arteries of the upper part of the plant. And &s;econdly,
if there were no returning veins from the lower part of the plant,
there ought to have been no effu&s;ion of blood from it. I have
&s;ince ob&s;erved on cutting a&s;under a large plant of pieris, and
al&s;o a large plant of tragopogon &s;corzonera, and in&s;tantly in&s;pect|ing
them with a common lens; that two concentric circles of
ve&s;&s;els were vi&s;ible, which oozed a milky juice; the internal cir|cle
of the upper divi&s;ion of the two plants, and the external one
of the lower divi&s;ion, appeared to bleed more copiou&s;ly, and in
quicker &s;treams, than the external circle of the upper divi&s;ion,
and the internal one of the lower divi&s;ion; whence I concluded,
that the ve&s;&s;els of the internal circles were arteries, and tho&s;e of
the external ones veins; and that the arteries of the upper part
of the plant, which ari&s;e from the upper part of the caudex of
each individual bud, were thus &s;een to pour out more blood, and
in a quicker &s;tream, than the veins of the lower part of the plant,
as they return from the roots.</P>
<P>Add to this, that as the pulmonary arteries in the green leaves
of plants, and in their petals, have corre&s;pondent veins vi&s;ible to
the eye; and that the&s;e are al&s;o &s;een in the calyxes of &s;ome
flowers, which from their other evident u&s;es can not be e&s;teemed
pulmonary organs; There is the &s;tricte&s;t analogy to believe, that
the aortal arteries of the bark of the trunk and roots have al&s;o
their corre&s;pondent veins.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s to evince that the ve&s;&s;els returning from the roots
of plants, which oozed out a milky juice, were in reality not
ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, I cut off the &s;tem of a large &s;purge plant, eu|phorbia
helio&s;copia, about a foot and half from the ground, and
bent it down into a cup of a decoction of madder, rubia tinctoria,
<PB N="54" REF="60">
in which it was confined two or three minutes, and wiping the
end clean I pre&s;ently cut off about an eighth of an inch of it with
a &s;harp penknife, and ob&s;erved with a common lens the large ab|&s;orbent
ve&s;&s;els to be coloured with the madder, while the veins
continued to effu&s;e a little white blood; and thus demon&s;trated
both the exi&s;tence of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els and returning veins. See
Sect II. 2.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the upper part of the plant had al&s;o its &s;tem
&s;et in the decoction of madder, and after two or three minutes
on cutting off about the eighth of an inch of it, or &s;imply by
wiping the extremity, the large ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els were &s;een by the
naked eye to be coloured with the madder, and the arteries con|tinued
to effu&s;e a large quantity of milky blood. The &s;ame ex|periments
were tried on a plant of tragopogon with the &s;ame
event.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be here ob&s;erved, that the decoction of madder
&s;hould be fre&s;h made, as otherwi&s;e the colouring matter is liable
to form it&s;elf into molecules, too large to be imbibed by any other
ve&s;&s;els but the trunks of the ab&s;orbents, which may be &s;aid to re|&s;emble
the receptaculum chyli of animals, as they pa&s;s from the
lower extremity of the caudex of each bud to the upper one.</P>
<P>A proof of the circulation of the juices of plants has been de|duced
from the comunication of white &s;pots from a grafted &s;cion
to the whole of the tree in which it was ingrafted. Mr. Fair-child
budded a pa&s;&s;ion-tree, who&s;e leaves were &s;potted with yellow,
into one which bears long fruit. The buds did not take, ne|vertheless
in a fortnight yellow &s;pots began to &s;hew them&s;elves
about three feet above the inoculation; and in a &s;hort time af|terwards
yellow &s;pots appeared on a &s;hoot, which came out of the
ground from another part of the plant. Bradley on Gardening,
Vol. II. p. 129.</P>
<P>And Mr. Lawrence ob&s;erves, that the yellow &s;triped ja&s;&s;amine
has afforded a demon&s;tration of the circulation of the juices in a
tree; he inoculated in Augu&s;t the buds of &s;triped ja&s;&s;amine-trees into
the branches of plain ones; and a&s;&s;erts, that he has &s;everal
times experienced, that if the bud lives but two or three months,
it will communicate its virtue or di&s;ea&s;e to the whole circumfluent
&s;ap, and the tree will become entirely &s;triped. Art of Garden|ing,
<PB N="55" REF="61">
p. 66. The&s;e are both of them important facts, as they
are related from re&s;pectable authorities.</P>
<P>And I think I have my&s;elf ob&s;erved in two pear-trees about
twenty years old, who&s;e branches were much injured by canker,
that on ingrafting hardier pear-&s;cions on their &s;ummits, they be|came
healthier trees, which can only he explained from a better
&s;angui&s;ication produced in the leaves of the new buds.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been ob&s;erved by an ingenious, lady, that though
fruit-trees ingrafted on various kinds of &s;tocks are &s;uppo&s;ed to bear
&s;imilar fruit, yet that this is not accurately &s;o; as on &s;ome
&s;tocks &s;he has known the ingrafted &s;cions of apple-trees to &s;uffer
con&s;iderable change for the wor&s;e compared with the fruit of the
parent-tree; whereas tho&s;e &s;cions, which can he made to grow
by &s;triking roots into the earth, &s;he believes to &s;uffer no deteriora|tion.
If this really occurs, it &s;hould be in a very &s;light degree,
as the fruit is formed by the action of &s;ecretion, and depends on
the glands of the part more than on any &s;light change of the ve|getable
blood, from which the &s;ecretion is &s;elected or produced.
Neverthele&s;s if the fact be a&s;certained, it confirms the
truth of the exi&s;tence of a vegetable circulation.</P>
<P>2. The circulation of the vegetable juices in the leaves of
plants, and in their trunks and roots, is performed without a
heart, and is very &s;imilar to that in the aorta of fi&s;h. In fi&s;h the
blood, after having pa&s;&s;ed through their gills, does not return to
the heart, as from the lungs, of air-breathing animals; but the
pulmonary vein, taking the &s;tructure of an artery, after having
received the blood from the gills, which there gains a more florid
colour, di&s;tributes it to the other parts of their bodies. A &s;imilar
&s;tructure obtains in the livers of fi&s;h, as well as in tho&s;e; of air-breathing
animals; the blood is collected from the me&s;entery and
inte&s;tines by the branches of their proper veins, which unite on their
entrance into the liver, branch out again, and a&s;&s;ume the
office of an artery, under the name of vena portarum, di&s;tri|buting
the blood through that large vi&s;cus for the purpo&s;e of the
&s;ecretion of biie; whence we &s;ee in the&s;e animals two circula|tions
independent of the power of the heart. Fir&s;t, that which
begins in the me&s;entery and inte&s;tines, and pa&s;&s;es through the
liver; and &s;econdly, that beginning at the termination of the
<PB N="56" REF="62">
veins of the gills, and pa&s;&s;ing through the other parts of the
body; both which circulations are carried on by the action of
tho&s;e re&s;pective arteries and veins. Monro's Phy&s;iology of Fi&s;h,
p. 19.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of the fluids in the leaves, and in the trunks and
roots of vegetables, is performed in a &s;imilar manner. Fir&s;t,
the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the roots, of the internal cells, and of
the external bark, with the venous blood returning from tho&s;e
parts, unite at the foot-&s;talk of the leaf, and then, like the vena
portarum, an artery commences without the intervention of a
heart, and receiving the &s;ap and venous blood &s;preads it in nu|merous
ramifications on the upper &s;urface of the leaf; here it
changes its colour, and becomes vegetable blood; and is again
collected by a pulmonary vein, and returns on the under &s;urface
of the leaf. This vein, like that which receives the blood from
the gills of fi&s;h, a&s;&s;umes the office of an artery, which corre&s;|ponds
with the aorta of animals, and branching again di&s;per&s;es
the blood upward to the plumula or &s;ummit of the bud, from its
caudex at the foot-&s;talk of the leaf, and downward along the
bark of the trunk to the roots; where it is received by a vein cor|re&s;ponding
to the vena cava of animals, after having expended what
was required for the &s;ecretions, excretions, and nutrition, and re|turns
to the caudex of the bud, and to the foot-&s;talk of the leaf.</P>
<P>3. The power, which produces a circulation without a heart
in vegetables, acts with an a&s;toni&s;hing force. In &s;ome of the
experiments of Dr. Hales, who fixed gla&s;s tubes to vine-&s;tumps
in the &s;pring, the &s;ap-juice ro&s;e above thirty feet; and in &s;ome
trees mu&s;t probably ari&s;e &s;till higher in the vernal months before
the leaves are expended; and this either &s;olely by the activity
of the ab&s;orbent mouths of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, or a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the vermi|cular
action of their &s;ides, which appear to con&s;i&s;t of a &s;piral line,
as de&s;cribed in Sect. II. 7. of this work.</P>
<P>When the &s;ap-juice rifes thirty-five feet high, which is about
the weight of the atmo&s;phere, the column pre&s;&s;es about fourteen
pounds on every &s;quare inch. Now if the area of the mouth of
an ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;el be only one ten thou&s;andth part of the area of
a &s;quare inch, the ten thou&s;andth part of fourteen pounds is the
whole that counteracts the efforts of each ab&s;orbent mouth; and
<PB N="57" REF="63">
as the ve&s;&s;els of vegetables appear to have both very minute dia|meters,
and very rigid &s;ides, they are thence prevented from
aneuri&s;m or rupture by the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o high a column of &s;ap-juice.</P>
<P>The &s;ame philo&s;opher, by fixing gla&s;s tubes to the arteries of
hor&s;es, as near the heart as was practicable, found the blood in
them to ri&s;e only nine or ten feet; whence it appears, that a cir|culation
of blood may be carried on more forcibly by the action of the mouths
of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, than by the apparently more
violent exertions of the heart, the power of which was calcu|lated
by Borelli and others to be &s;o enormou&s;ly great as to equal
the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;ome thou&s;and pounds, as the counter pre&s;&s;ure of
the moving blood acts on &s;o large a &s;urface as that of the whole
internal &s;ides of the heart.</P>
<P>But as a column of blood nine feet high pre&s;&s;es with le&s;s than one
third of the weight of the atmo&s;phere, or about four pounds on
every &s;quare inch of &s;urface; and as the internal &s;urface of
the left cavity of the heart of a hor&s;e may not exceed thirty
&s;quare inches, its whole power does not overcome the re&s;i&s;tance
of more than 120 pounds.</P>
<P>Hence it becomes intelligible, how the circulation of the
blood in the vena portarum of the liver is performed without any
apparent pul&s;ation, or contraction of its &s;ides like an artery,
which &s;ome have indeed &s;uppo&s;ed it to po&s;&s;e&s;s, but &s;imply by the
force of ab&s;orption exerted by the mouths of the veins, which
&s;upply it with blood.</P>
<P>Secondly, how the circulation of the blood in the bodies of
fi&s;h, except in their gills, is carried on through their &s;y&s;tem with|out
the action of the heart. And thirdly, how the blood in the
vena cava of the human body, as well as the fluids imbibed by
the lacteals and lymphatics are carried forwards to the heart by
the power alone of their ab&s;orbent mouths, which drink up their
blood from the capillaries, or their other fluids from the &s;urfaces
or cavities of the body. And la&s;tly, how the whole circulation
in vegetables is performed in very minute ve&s;&s;els without valves,
and without a heart, &s;olely by the power of ab&s;orption, circum|&s;tances
which have long perplexed the phy&s;iology both of the
animal and vegetable kingdoms.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="64">
Another circum&s;tance attending the circulation of the juices
in vegetables, as well as the circulation of the blood in animal
bodies, has not been &s;ufficiently attended to: and that is, that
the re&s;i&s;tance to the pa&s;&s;age of the&s;e fluids from the terminations
of the arteries in what are termed capillaries, to the beginnings of
the veins and through the glands of various kinds, is much le&s;s
than is generally imagined, as we &s;ee with what great force the
mouths of both the vegetable and animal ab&s;orbents imbibe their
fluids; and that the beginnings of the veins and the mouths of
the lacteals and lymphatics, and probably tho&s;e belonging to every
kind of gland, po&s;&s;e&s;s this great power of ab&s;orption. And that
on this account, when wounds are made in trees in the &s;ummer
months, when the umbilical &s;ap-ve&s;&s;els of the root have cea&s;ed
to act, &s;uch wounds powerfully ab&s;orb any fluid, whether &s;alu|tary
or poi&s;onous, which is applied to them, which does not
occur during the bleeding &s;ea&s;on, as the &s;ap-juice from the di&s;|&s;evered
ve&s;&s;els of the alburnum &s;upplies a greater quantity of fluid
than the other parts of the wound can imbibe.</P>
<P>4. The red particles of blood have been &s;aid by Lewenhook
and others, who have in&s;pected them in micro&s;copes, to be of
the &s;ame &s;ize in all creatures. Hence nature has formed no very
&s;mall animals with a general circulation of warm red blood; the
mou&s;e and humming bird are perhaps the lea&s;t. When it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to form the ve&s;&s;els much more minute, a diluter kind of
yellow or milky blood, or one nearly tran&s;parent, con&s;titutes the
greate&s;t part of the vital fluid, as in in&s;ects of various kinds, and
in the white mu&s;cles of fi&s;h; whence aro&s;e a difficulty to the ana|tomi&s;t
of vi&s;ibly injecting the&s;e &s;maller &s;eries of ve&s;&s;els as they
are too minute to convey almo&s;t any coloured particles.</P>
<P>In the vegetable world the finer &s;y&s;tems of their ve&s;&s;els have
&s;till greater tenuity, and hence evade our eyes and micro&s;copes;
and as their coats po&s;&s;e&s;s at the &s;ame time a greater rigidity, they
are in general on that account al&s;o incapable of receiving coloured
injections, which has rendered the anatomy of plants &s;o much
more difficult to inve&s;tigate than that of animals, and mu&s;t apo|logi&s;e
for the imper&s;ections of this part of the work, but affords
to argument again&s;t the exi&s;tence of a vegetable circulation.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="65">
It is probable that by immer&s;ing charcoal, nicely made by &s;low
calcination, in quick&s;ilver, or even in melted coloured wax, as it
&s;o greedily ab&s;orbs almo&s;t all fluids, when recently taken from the
fire, or cooled without the contact of air, we might produce
beautiful vegetable preparations, and give more accurate light into
the anatomy of plants. But the column of quick&s;ilver employed
to pu&s;h forwards the injection &s;hould not be too high, le&s;t it
&s;hould rupture the ve&s;&s;els it ought only to fill, as I &s;uppo&s;e has
&s;ometimes happened in thus injecting the glands or capillaries of
animal bodies.</P>
<P>5. Recapitulation. We may finally conclude, that the circu|lation
of vegetables is performed like that of animals by the irri|tability
of their ve&s;&s;els to the &s;timulus of the fluids, which they
ab&s;orb and protrude; that is, that the extremities of the branch|ing
veins of the leaves forcibly ab&s;orb the vegetable blood from
the extremities of their arteries, which corre&s;pond with the pul|monary
arteries of animals; and that it is thus pu&s;hed on to the
foot-&s;talk of the leaf, where the veins unite, and branching out
again take the office of an artery, like the aorta in fi&s;h, without
perceptible pul&s;ation. The blood in this artery is pu&s;hed forwards
by that behind it, the motion of which was given by the power
of ab&s;orption in the pulmonary vein, till it arrives an the extre|mities
of the&s;e aortal branches, and is there again forcibly ab|&s;orbed
by the terminations of the corre&s;pondent veins, and again
pu&s;hed forwards to the caudex gemmae, and to the foot-&s;talk of
the leaf, like the blood in the vena cava of animals.</P>
<P>A part of this blood is at the &s;ame time forcibly &s;elected and
ab&s;orbed by the various glands for the purpo&s;es of the nece&s;&s;ary
&s;ecretions, excretions, or nutrition; and the &s;ap-juice or chyle and
the water, which is acquired by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els that
corre&s;pond to the lacteal and lymphatic ve&s;&s;els of animals, is car|ried,
as well as the remainder of the blood, to the foot-&s;talk of
the leaf. Here the&s;e ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els are believed to pu&s;h their
contents into the veins corre&s;pondent to the vena cava of ani|mals,
and which now uniting without the intervention of a heart,
a&s;&s;ume the name and office of the pulmonary arteries; and
branching out upon the leaf expo&s;e the returning blood and new
&s;ap-juice to the influence of the air. And finally, all this is ac|compli&s;hed
<PB N="60" REF="66">
by the power of ab&s;orption, as in the aortal arteries,
and vena portarum, of fi&s;h, which is excited into action by the
irritability of the mouths of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els to the &s;timulus of the
fluids, which they ab&s;orb.</P>
<P>2d. A circulation of vegetable juices, in every re&s;pect &s;imilar to
that in the common leaves above de&s;cribed, exi&s;ts in the bractes or
floral-leaves, except that the leaves of the leaf-bud prepare
their juices for the production and nouri&s;hment of other buds in
their bo&s;oms; but the&s;e bractes, which are the lungs of the fruc|tification,
prepare their juices for the nouri&s;hment of the peri|carp
and its included &s;eeds, but not for that of the corol with
its anthers and &s;tigmas, as the&s;e in many flowers exi&s;t before
the production of the floral-leaves, as in colchicum and hama|melis.</P>
<P>3d. Another circulation of vegetable juices exi&s;ts in the &s;exual
parts of flowers, including the nectaries and corols. In the co|rols
the vegetable blood is expo&s;ed to the influence of the air, and
prepared for the &s;ecretion of honey, which is the food or &s;upport
of the anthers and &s;tigmas as treated of in the &s;ection IV. V. 1.
and in Section VII. 4. In the&s;e the progre&s;&s;ion and circulation
of the fluids mu&s;t be cau&s;ed by the power of ab&s;orption, which
we have &s;hewn to be a greater force than that of the heart of
animals.</P>
<P>4th. The progre&s;s of the fluids imbibed by vegetable lacteals
from the earth, and by their lymphatics from the air, and from
the &s;urfaces of their internal cells, is evidently began and carried
on by the power of ab&s;orption of their terminating mouths, and
the annular contraction of their &s;piral fibres.</P>
<P>5th. And la&s;tly, the wonderful force with which the &s;ap-juice
is drank up and protruded in the umbilical ve&s;&s;els, which expands
and nouri&s;hes the buds of trees, and which forms the wires of
&s;trawberries above ground, and tho&s;e of potatoes under ground,
with the great variety of bulbs and root-&s;cions, is to be a&s;cribed
to this &s;ingle principle of ab&s;orption. Except that &s;ome of the&s;e
long cylindric ve&s;&s;els are evidently compo&s;ed of a &s;piral line,
as mentioned in Sect. II. 7. and which may by the annular con|traction
of this &s;piral line carry the fluids they have ab&s;orbed
with great force either in a forward or retrograde direction.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="67">
6. Finally I conclude, that the branching ab&s;orbents of the
roots unite at the lower caudex of each bud, before it ri&s;es out
of the earth, and forms a large trunk, which pa&s;&s;es up the albur|num
of the tree to the upper caudex of the bud at the foot-&s;talk
of the leaf, and may be compared to the receptaculum
chyli of animals extended to &s;o great a length; and that it
there joins the great returning vein, which al&s;o is compo&s;ed
of the branching veins of the roots uniting at the lower caudex
of the bud, and a&s;cending terminates at the upper caudex of
it, where it becomes again branched, and forms the pulmonary
artery.</P>
<P>The aorta or great artery de&s;cends, I &s;uppo&s;e, along with the
great vein, or vena cava above mentioned; and branching in the
roots below, and on all other parts of the individual leaf-bud,
performs the offices of &s;ecretion and nutrition. The pulmonary
arteries and veins belong to the leaf; the former expo&s;es the
blood to the atmo&s;phere beneath a thin moi&s;t pellicle, whence
it becomes oxygenated, and probably acquires &s;ome warmth,
and pho&s;phoric acid, and the &s;pirit of vegetable life. The
latter collects the aerated blood by its branches, and con|veys
it to the upper caudex of the bud, at the foot-&s;talk of
the leaf, where it becomes the aorta or great artery above-mentioned.</P>
<P>The &s;ides of the long ab&s;orbent trunks, or receptacles of
chyle, which ri&s;e from the lower caudex and terminate in the
upper caudex of each bud, as well as the long trunks of the um|bilical
ve&s;&s;els de&s;cribed in Sect. III. evidently con&s;i&s;t of a &s;piral
line, as well as tho&s;e trunks of ab&s;orbents, which imbibe aqueous
fluids from the air, and a part of their per&s;pirable matter on the
&s;urfaces of the leaves. But whether the pulmonary and aortal
arteries or great veins con&s;i&s;t of a &s;milar &s;tructure is not yet a&s;|certained.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here relate the following experiments, which were
made a few days ago, to confirm or confute the ideas above de|livered.</P>
<P>Some &s;tems of large &s;purge, euphorbia, were &s;et upright in a
decoction of oak-galls, and others in a &s;olution of green vitriol.
On the next day the&s;e were reciprocally removed from the one
<PB N="62" REF="68">
to the other, as by this management I &s;uppo&s;ed that the black
molecules would be produced in the ve&s;&s;els of the plants, and
would thence appear higher in tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els than if the black mole|cules
had been formed by a mixture of the two fluids previous to
their ab&s;orption.</P>
<P>On cutting the&s;e horizontally &s;lice after &s;lice with a &s;harp
knife, and in&s;pecting them with a common lens, the milky blood
was &s;een to ooze as before de&s;cribed, from an external ring of the
bark; and an interior ring of coloured points was agreeably
vi&s;ible many inches up the &s;tem; but on &s;licing the &s;tem from be|low
up to the in&s;ertion of the leaves and buds in their bo&s;oms, I
per&s;uaded my&s;elf that I could perceive the coloured ab&s;orbents
of the &s;tem enlarged at the part where each with the attendant
vein changes into a pulmonary artery, and pa&s;&s;es into the leaf,
forming three or more of the ribs of it, and thus con&s;tituting the
upper part of the caudex gemmae.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance was beautifully vi&s;ible, which was, that
the coloured cylinder of ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els had evidently &s;eparated
to allow the new bud to apply its interior termination to the pith;
which probably, when it was &s;ecreted by the glands of the
caudex of the parent bud, found in this &s;ituation a proper nidus,
and due nutriment for its embryon &s;tate, as in the uterus of the
female.</P>
<P>Some other kinds of experiments I directed with de&s;ign to
&s;hew the part of the lower caudex of each bud, where the branch|ing
ab&s;orbents and veins of the root unite each into one trunk,
before they a&s;cend along the bole of the tree; and al&s;o to &s;hew,
as in the above experiment, the upper caudex of each bud,
where the veins are joined by the ab&s;orbents, and become the
pulmonary arteries of each leaf, but did not &s;ucceed quite to my
wi&s;h, though what I could ob&s;erve &s;eemed to confirm the above theory.
I had not lei&s;ure to repeat the experiments with &s;uffi|cient
attention, but &s;hall here in few words de&s;cribe the manner
of making them, hoping &s;ome one may be induced to pro&s;ecute
them with &s;ucce&s;s, and to inject vegetable ve&s;&s;els, as the anato|mi&s;ts
do tho&s;e of animals.</P>
<P>A part of a leaf-&s;talk, and the joint to which it adhered, with
about half an inch of the &s;tem above and below the joint, were
<PB N="63" REF="69">
cut off from &s;ome la&s;t year's twigs, and al&s;o the caudex of &s;ome
herbaceous plants. The&s;e were covered with &s;and in a crucible
placed on the fire, till they were red hot, &s;o that the vegetable
joints were become charcoal. They were then taken out of the
&s;and, and &s;ome immer&s;ed in melted &s;uet, others in melted bees-wax,
others in white paint, and one or two in an amalgama of
quick&s;ilver and zinc, which happened to be prepared for the pur|po&s;es
of electricity. When they were cold, on &s;licing them,
&s;ome horizontally, and others vertically, I per&s;uaded my&s;elf that
the blood-ve&s;&s;els above mentioned, as well as the pulmonary vein
and aortal artery, were vi&s;ible in the two extremiti&eacute;s of the long
caudex of the bud, as well as the long trunks of the arteries,
veins, and ab&s;orbents, which con&s;titute the middle part of it.</P>

all coloured injections, except quick&s;ilver; and the terminations
of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are &s;o tender, that the nece&s;&s;ary weight of the
quick&s;ilver is liable to break them, and thus mi&s;inform the ob|&s;erve,
as mentioned in Sect. V. 4. Little more is therefore
known of them than their effect, which is, that they &s;ecrete,
that is &s;eparate or produce, &s;ome, fluid from the blood; as bile,
&s;aliva, urine, milk.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els of vegetables being &s;till more minute, and more ri|gid,
the &s;tructure of their glands is &s;till further removed from our
di&s;covery. Their effects are however as evident as tho&s;e of the
glands of animals in the &s;ecretion or production of various fluids,
which become &s;olid, as their aqueous parts are ab&s;orbed or ex|haled,
as mucilage, &s;tarch, oil, &s;ugar, honey, wax, turpentines,

mu&s;t be effected in a &s;imilar manner to that in animal bodies,
which is believed to be performed by the mouth of each gland
being irritated into action by the &s;timulus of the blood, which is
brought to it, and that by a kind of appetite it drinks up a part
of the blood, and converts it to the fluid, which it &s;ecretes,
which then becomes more or le&s;s &s;olid, as its aqueous parts are
ab&s;orbed or exhaled.</P>
<P>II. 1. Mucilage is found in all parts of plants, as being an e&s;|&s;ential
con&s;tituent of vegetable as of animal bodies; &s;o when an
extract is made by boiling plants in water, the mucilage makes
the greate&s;t part of this extract. The mucilage called gum ara|bic
is obtained from mimo&s;a nilotica, gum tragacanth ex&s;udes from
a&s;tragalus tragacantha, as a &s;imilar gum ex&s;udes from our cherry
and plumb-trees; &s;agoe is the pith of the lycas circinalis; and
&s;alep is the root of the orchis dried in an oven.</P>
<P>This mucilage &s;eems to &s;erve as nouri&s;hment to the plant; fir&s;t,
becau&s;e it is found in all vegetable as well as animal materials, as
they decompo&s;e in dunghills; &s;econdly, becau&s;e it forwards the
growth of vegetables, when &s;pread upon land; thirdly, becau&s;e
tho&s;e trees which bleed much gum, are weakened and frequently
die; and la&s;tly, becau&s;e it is evidently laid up in the roots and
&s;eeds of various vegetables for the nouri&s;hment of the young
plants. But in the&s;e it &s;eems to undergo a change either in part
chemical, or wholly by the dige&s;tive organs of the embryon
plant, and is converted into &s;ugar as in the tran&s;mutation of
barley into malt; and as appears from the &s;weet ta&s;te of onions
and potatoes, when boiled after they have germinated; and as
&s;ugar abounds in the vernal &s;ap-juice of trees in &s;uch quantity as
to be capable of fermentation.</P>
<P>III. 1. Starch is another kind of mucilage, which differs from
tho&s;e above mentioned in its property of not di&s;&s;olving in cold
water, and can hence be ea&s;ily &s;eparated from them. If eight
pounds of good raw potatoes be grated by means of a bread-grater
into cold water; and, after well agitating the mixture,
the &s;tarch be &s;uffered to &s;ub&s;ide; and this &s;tarch be then mixed
with eight other pounds of boiled potatoes, as good bread may
be made as from the be&s;t wheat flour; as is affirmed by Mon&s;.
<PB N="67" REF="73">
Parmentier. From this it appears, that the quantity of &s;tarch
in potatoes and in wheat produces the principal difference of
their re&s;pective flours. See Zoonomia, P. III. Article I. 2. 3. 4.</P>
<P>2. There is rea&s;on to believe that the mucilage during the
growth of the plant is converted into &s;tarch; and that this pro|ce&s;s
continues in grain &s;ome time after it is carried into the barn
or granary, which occa&s;ions old wheat to produce better flour
for the baker; and old oats and old beans are univer&s;ally be|lieved
to give more nouri&s;hment to hor&s;es. I &s;hall here add a
conjecture, that I &s;uppo&s;e the u&s;e of alum in making bread con|&s;i&s;ts
in its coagulating the mucilage, and perhaps thus contribu|ting
to convert it into &s;tarch; for the bakers mix it principally
with new wheat; and affirm, that it makes the flour of new
wheat equal to old.</P>
<P>Where much alum is mixed with bread, it may be di&s;tingu&s;hed
by the eye by a curious circum&s;tance, which is, that where two
loaves have &s;tuck together in the oven, they break from each
other with a much &s;moother &s;urface, where they had adhered,
than tho&s;e loaves do which do not contain alum.</P>
<P>Add to this, that alum is al&s;o u&s;ed by the London bakers for
the purpo&s;e of clearing the river water, with which they are &s;up|plied,
which is frequently muddy; and al&s;o for in&s;tantaneou&s;ly
de&s;troying the volatile alkali, which is &s;aid to exi&s;t in &s;ome
London wells owing to the vicinity of dunghills. The&s;e pur|po&s;es
it probably fulfils by coagulating the mucilage, which
may occa&s;ionally be mixed with the water and &s;upport the
mud in it; or by uniting with the calcareous earth, or
with the volatile alkali which it may contain, and depo&s;iting the
new-formed gyp&s;um, or its own argillaceous ba&s;e, the de&s;cent of
which may carry down other impurities along with it, in the
&s;ame manner as &s;ome muddy wines have been rendered fine, not
by filtering them through &s;and, as then the mud retained on the
&s;urface of the &s;and &s;oon prevents the de&s;cent of the wine through
it, but by pa&s;&s;ing clean &s;and in &s;howers by means of a riddle
through the wine. Alum is &s;aid to be u&s;ed by the Chine&s;e for
the purpo&s;e of cleaning the water of &s;ome &s;tagnant re&s;ervoirs;
<PB N="68" REF="74">
and when u&s;ed in &s;mall quantity may in all the&s;e re&s;pects be rather
&s;alutary than injurious to the bread of London.</P>
<P>Alum is &s;aid al&s;o to be u&s;ed in the manufactory of hair-powder,
which &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of &s;tarch without mucilage, that the hair
may not be glued together by the per&s;pirable matter of the head,
or by an accidental &s;hower. Whether it has the property of
converting mucilage into &s;tarch might be ea&s;ily a&s;certained by ex|periment,
by wa&s;hing in cold water alone one parcel of wheat
flour, and wa&s;hing a &s;imilar parcel in a &s;olution of alum in water.</P>
<P>3. Another conjecture I &s;hall introduce here is, that it is pro|bable
that the action of fro&s;t al&s;o may tend to coagulate mucilage,
or convert it into &s;tarch; for in the colder parts of Britain it is
&s;aid, that the corn never ripens till they have fro&s;ty nights; and
I well remember many years ago having ob&s;erved, that &s;ome
book-binder's pa&s;te made by boiling wheat-flour and water, after
it had been frozen, cea&s;ed to cohere on being pre&s;&s;ed together,
like the crumbs of &s;ome bread; and I have been told by &s;ome
hou&s;ewives that their pancakes become much lighter if &s;now be
mixed with the flour in&s;tead of water. See Sect. XVI. 3. 2.</P>
<P>4. Now as &s;tarch is not &s;oluble in cold water, the bitter and
acrid particles of plants may be wa&s;hed from it along with the
mucilage; whence in times of &s;carcity this nouri&s;hing part of ve|getables
may be obtained by elutriation from poi&s;onous plants; on
this circum&s;tance principally depends the whole&s;omene&s;s of the
bread made from the ca&s;&s;ava, the acrid and poi&s;onous particles
being previou&s;ly wa&s;hed away along with the mucilage. Mon&s;.
Parmentier found the &s;tarch from the root of the white bryony
to contain no acrimony, and to be a whole&s;ome article of food.</P>
<P>IV. 1. Many &s;eeds contain much oil mixed with their muci|lage,
or &s;tarch; as nuts, almonds, flax-&s;eed, rape-&s;eed. Some
of the&s;e contain al&s;o a bitter or narcotic material, as bitter al|monds,
apricot kernels, acorns, hor&s;e-che&s;nuts; which, as it
adheres to the mucilage, may be &s;eparated from the oil; as in
expre&s;&s;ing the oil from bitter almonds, which is as good as from
&s;weet ones. And it is probable by grating to powder, and
wa&s;hing in cold water, the kernels of acorns, and hor&s;e-che&s;nuts,
or &s;imply by pre&s;&s;ure, that a whole&s;ome &s;tarch, or oil, might be
procured. It is probable al&s;o that the roots of fern treated in
<PB N="69" REF="75">
this manner would afford good nouri&s;hment, as the&s;e are &s;aid
to be eaten by the inhabitants of New Zealand, and have been
u&s;ed in this country in times of great &s;carcity. And that the
roots of nymphaea, water-lily, might be thus made into whole&s;ome
bread, (which are &s;aid to have been eaten in Egypt by
Herodotus) and the roots of many other water-plants,
which might thus become articles of &s;ubaquatic agriculture, which is
an art much wanted in this country. See Sect. XI. 2. 5. and
XVII. 2. 3.</P>
<P>V. 1. The dige&s;tive power of animals &s;eems to be princi|pally
exerted in converting their food into &s;ugar; &s;ince the
chyle of all animals re&s;embles milk, which contains much &s;ugar,
and thence &s;pontaneou&s;ly runs into fermentation, which termi|nates
in the production of acid, as in butter-milk. In Siberia
the natives di&s;til a &s;pirituous and intoxicating liquor from milk
thus fermented. Gmelin. In the diabetes there is rea&s;on to
believe, that the chyle pa&s;&s;es off into the bladder without being
previou&s;ly mixed with the blood; and there is a curious hi&s;tory
of a patient in the infirmary at Stafford, who laboured under a
diabetes, he eat and drank thrice as much as mo&s;t moderate
men, and from &s;ixteen to eighteen ounces, and even twenty
ounces of coar&s;e &s;ugar was extracted for &s;ome time daily from
his urine. Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXIX. 4.</P>
<P>2. In like manner the dige&s;tive powers of the young vegeta|ble,
with the chemical agents of heat and moi&s;ture, convert the
&s;tarch or mucilage of the root or &s;eed into &s;ugar for its own nou|ri&s;hment;
or they obtain &s;ugar ready prepared for them from
&s;ome roots, as the beet-root; from many fruits, as grapes, pears,
peaches; from the milk of cocoa-nuts, and from the &s;ap-juice
of the &s;ugar-maple, birch, and many other trees. And thus it
appears probable, that &s;ugar is the principal nutriment of both
animal and vegetable beings. That it is the mo&s;t nutritive part
of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances is evinced by the well a&s;certained fact,
that the &s;laves in Jamaica grow fat in the &s;ugar-harve&s;t, though
they endure at that time much more labour.</P>
<P>Yet there is an idle notion propagated among&s;t the people
that &s;ugar is unwhole&s;ome; it is indeed probable, that the mo&s;t
nouri&s;hing materials may be taken more ea&s;ily to exce&s;s, but not
<PB N="70" REF="76">
that it is therefore in general unwhole&s;ome; at the &s;ame time it
is probable, that &s;ome fruits pre&s;erved in &s;yrup, or &s;weet-meats,
may contribute to de&s;troy the teeth; &s;ince, if the &s;ugar &s;hould become
in a &s;tate of decompo&s;ition, and the &s;accharine acid
&s;hould abound, it will di&s;&s;olve calcareous earth with greater
avidity than any other acid.</P>
<P>3. In many plants &s;ugar is found ready prepared, as above
mentioned; thus in the beet-root, the cry&s;tals of it may be dif|cerned
by a micro&s;cope; and may be extracted from the muci|laginous
matter of the root by di&s;&s;olving it in rectified &s;pirit of
wine; which will unite with &s;ugar but not with mucilage. In
the joints of gra&s;s and of corn it may be di&s;covered by the ta&s;te.
In the manna-a&s;h, fraxinus ornus, the &s;ame &s;accharine matter
is produced along with the e&s;&s;ential &s;alt of the plant, which is
purgative; and in the &s;ugar-cane it abounds in &s;uch large quan|tity
as to contribute much to the nouri&s;hment of mankind.
And,&mdash;and what?&mdash;Great God of Ju&s;tice! grant, that it may
&s;oon be cultivated only by the hands of freedom, and may
thence give happine&s;s to the labourer, as well as to the merchant
and con&s;umer.</P>
<P>4. Another &s;ource of &s;ugar in vegetables is in the fruit, which
in many plants changes from an au&s;tere acid to a &s;accharine acid,
as in goo&s;eberries, apples, oranges. This change continues
to proceed after the pears and apples, or oranges, are taken from
the tree into our &s;torehou&s;es, but the fruit in this &s;ituation con|tinues
to ripen by a vegetable proce&s;s, as it can not be &s;aid to be
dead, becau&s;e it does not yet undergo fermentation or putrefac|tion,
or other chemical di&s;&s;olution; and though its progre&s;s in
ripening may be forwarded by warmth, yet it mu&s;t &s;till be a&s;|cribed
to a vegetable proce&s;s; as the plants them&s;elves grow
quicker when expo&s;ed to additional heat.</P>
<P>5. But there are other means of increa&s;ing or ha&s;tening the
&s;accharine proce&s;s in au&s;tere vegetable fruits, as by brui&s;ing
them, or by baking them, both which mu&s;t de&s;troy the life of
the fruit; thus when apples are brui&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of mak|ing
cyder, they become &s;weeter even in the act of brui&s;ing them;
and many pears change from an au&s;tere to a &s;weet juice &s;imply
by the heat of baking; and it is probable that malt acquires a
<PB N="71" REF="77">
great a part, though not the whole of its &s;accharine matter, in
the act of drying. This chemical production or increa&s;e of
&s;ugar in vegetable jucices is worth being further inquired into;
&s;ince if &s;ugar could be made from its elements without the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance
of vegetation, &s;uch abundant food might be &s;upplied as
might tenfold increa&s;e the number of mankind!</P>
<P>It is a curious circum&s;tance not yet &s;ufficiently under&s;tood,
that not only &s;tarch appears to be convertible into &s;ugar by the
vegetable proce&s;s of dige&s;tion, as in the germination of farinace|ous
&s;eeds; but that &s;ugar is capable of being converted into
&s;tarch, as appears in the ripening proce&s;s of &s;ome pears, which
fir&s;t contain a &s;weet-juice, and afterwards become mealy.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of this &s;accharine matter of the fruit or &s;ap-juice in
the vegetable economy is for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying the young
&s;eed or bud with nouri&s;hment to enable it the better to &s;trike
its roots into the earth, and to elevate its leaves into the air, and
thus by its quicker growth to rival its neighbours in their con|tentions
for air, and light, and moi&s;ture, which are nece&s;&s;ary
for its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>VI. 1. The production of honey is perhaps one of the mo&s;t
important vegetable &s;ecretions, except that of the prolific farina
from the anthers; and of the favilla, or new embryon, in the
axilla of the leaf. The glands for this purpo&s;e, or certainly
the re&s;ervoirs, which contain the honey after it is &s;ecreted, are
in many flowers vi&s;ible to the naked eye; as in crown-impe|rial,
fritillaria imperialis; in monk&s;hood, aconitum napellus;
hellebore; ranunculus. It is neverthele&s;s probable, that this
re&s;ervoir of honey is frequently placed at a di&s;tance from the
gland, which &s;ecretes it, for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving it from
in&s;ects and from rain, which is often effected both by a very
complicated apparatus, and by an acrid or poi&s;onous juice, as
in the aconites and the hellebores above mentioned.</P>
<P>As the nectary, or honey-gland, always falls off along with
the corol, and anthers, and &s;tigmas; the&s;e appear to be parts
or appendages to each other. The vegetable blood is expo&s;ed
to the air in the corol, and thus is oxygenated or prepared for
the &s;ecretion of this important fluid; which I &s;uppo&s;e is again
reab&s;orbed, and &s;upplies nouri&s;hment to the anthers and &s;tigmas.
<PB N="72" REF="78">
Some acrid juices, and odorous particles, are at the &s;ame time
&s;ecreted from the blood thus oxygenated in the corol; which
&s;eem de&s;igned as one kind of defence again&s;t the depredations
of in&s;ects on this important re&s;ervoir of honey</P>
<P>2. The univer&s;ality of the production of honey in the vege|table
world, and the very complicated apparatus, which nature
has con&s;tructed in many flowers, as well as the acrid or dele|terious
juices &s;he has furni&s;hed tho&s;e flowers with, as in the
aconite, to protect this honey from rain, and from the depre|dations
of in&s;ects, &s;eem to imply, that this fluid is of very great
importance in the vegetable economy; and al&s;o that it was
nece&s;&s;ary to expo&s;e it to the open air previous to its reab&s;orp|tion
into the vegetable ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In the animal &s;y&s;tem the lacrymal gland &s;eparates its fluid,
into the open air for the purpo&s;e of moi&s;tening the eye; of this
fluid the part which does not exhale, is ab&s;orbed by the puncta
lacrymalia, and carried into the no&s;trils; but, as this is not a
nutritive fluid, the analogy goes no further than its &s;ecretion
into the open air, and its reab&s;orption into the &s;y&s;tem. The
per&s;pirable matter is another material &s;ecreted by animal glands
into the external air, and is in part reab&s;orbed, and in part exhaled.
And every other &s;ecreted fluid in the animal body
is in part ab&s;orbed again into the &s;y&s;tem, even tho&s;e which are
e&s;teemed excrementitious, is the urine; and others are proba|bly
entirely reab&s;orbed, as the bile, &s;aliva, and ga&s;tric juice.</P>
<P>That the honey is a nutritious fluid, perhaps the mo&s;t &s;o of
any vegetable production, appears from its great &s;imilarity to
&s;ugar, and from its affording &s;u&s;tenance to &s;uch numbers of in|&s;ects,
which live upon it &s;olely during &s;ummer, and lay it up
for their winter provi&s;ion. The&s;e proofs of its nutritive nature
evince the nece&s;&s;ity of its reab&s;orption into the vegetable &s;y&s;tem
for &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>3. It is probable, that the depredations of in&s;ects on this
nutritious fluid mu&s;t be injurious to the products of vegetation;
and would be much more &s;o, but that the plants have either
acquired means to defend their honey in part, or have learned
to make more, than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their own econo|my.
Thus in &s;ilene, catch-fly, and in dro&s;era, &s;un-dew, it is
<PB N="73" REF="79">
defended by a vi&s;cid juice from the attack of in&s;ects; in helle|bore,
and in aconite, it is defended by the difficult pa&s;&s;age to it,
and by the acrid juice of the plant, if in&s;ects &s;hould endeavour
to creep into the nectary, or pierce it with their probo&s;cis; and in
polygonum melampyrum, buck-wheat, and in cacalia &s;uaveolens,
alpine colts-foot, there &s;eems to be a &s;uperabundant quantity of
honey &s;ecreted, as tho&s;e flowers are perpetually loaded with bees
and butterflies, in&s;omuch that at Kempton-land in Germany,
Mr. Worlidge &s;ays, in his My&s;teries of Hu&s;bandry, Ch. IX. 3.
that he &s;aw forty great bee-hives filled with honey to the amount
of &s;eventy pounds in each in one fortnight by their being placed
near a large field of buck-wheat in flower; and I well remember
being my&s;elf a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;eeing the number of bees on a field of
buck-wheat in Shrop&s;hire, as well as on a plant of cacalia &s;ua|veolens
in my garden; from which the &s;cent of honey could be
perceived at many feet di&s;tance from the flower.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner the honey-dew on trees is very injurious
to them; in which di&s;ea&s;e the nutritive fluid, the vegetable &s;ap-juice,
&s;eems to be ex&s;uded by a retrograde motion of the cuta|neous
lymphatics, as in the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s of the la&s;t century,
or is devoured by in&s;ects, which pierce the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els of
the leaves at mid&s;ummer, feed on the vegetable chyle, and void
it almo&s;t unchanged. See Sect. III. II. 8. and XIV. I. 7.</P>
<P>To prevent the depredation of in&s;ects on honey a wealthy man
in Italy is &s;aid to have poi&s;oned his neighbour's bees, perhaps by
mixing ar&s;enic with honey, again&s;t which there is a flowery de|clamation
in Quintillian, No. XIII. This mixture of honey
and ar&s;enic may be u&s;ed with effect to poi&s;on flies, which &s;ome|times
abound in pernicious multitudes; for the flies which fre|quent
our hou&s;es are liable to great thir&s;t, as is &s;een by their
drinking any fluid, which is diffu&s;ed on a table; whence if a &s;light
&s;olution of ar&s;enic, with a little &s;ugar, be put thinly on a plate or
two, and &s;et on chimney-pieces or windows, the flies will ea|gerly
drink it, and peri&s;h almo&s;t in&s;tantly. It is probable that
wa&s;ps might be thus de&s;troyed in hot hou&s;es, if a little honey was
added to attract them by its odour.</P>
<P>As the u&s;e of the wax is to pre&s;erve the du&s;t of the anthers
from moi&s;ture, which would prematurely bur&s;t them, the bees,
<PB N="74" REF="80">
which collect this for the con&s;truction of the combs or cells, and
collect the farina al&s;o probably for bee-bread for their larvae or
maggots, mu&s;t on both the&s;e accounts al&s;o injure the vegetation of
a country, where they too much abound.</P>
<P>4. It is not ea&s;y to conjecture, why it was nece&s;&s;ary, that this
&s;ecretion of honey &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the open air in the nec|tary
or honey-cup; for which purpo&s;e &s;o great an apparatus for
its defence from in&s;ects and from &s;howers became nece&s;&s;ary.
This difficulty increa&s;es, when we recollect, that the &s;ugar in the
joints of gra&s;s, in the &s;ugar-cane; and in the roots of beets, and
in ripe fruits, is produced without expo&s;ure to the air. But on
&s;uppo&s;ition of its &s;upplying nutriment to the anthers and &s;tigmas,
it may thus acquire greater oxygenation for the purpo&s;e of pro|ducing
the greater powers of amatorial &s;en&s;ibility, as mentioned
in Sect. IV. 5. 6. and probably in this circum&s;tance alone differs
from &s;ugar.</P>
<P>From this provi&s;ion of honey for the male and female parts of
flowers, and from the provi&s;ions of &s;ugar, &s;tarch and mucilage, in
the fruits, &s;eeds, roots, and albarnum of plants, laid up for
the nutriment of the young progeny; not only a very numerous
cla&s;s of in&s;ects, but a great part of the larger animals, procure
their food. Surely this mu&s;t be called a wi&s;e provi&s;ion of the
Author of nature, as by the&s;e means innumerable animals enjoy
life and plea&s;ure without producing pain to others; for the em|bryons
in the&s;e buds, &s;eeds, or eggs, as well as the nutriment
laid up for them, are not yet endued with &s;en&s;itive life. There
is another &s;ource of nutriment provided for young animals, which
&s;till further evinces the benevolence of the Author of nature;
and that is the milk furni&s;hed by the mother to her offspring;
by this beautiful contrivance the mother acquires plea&s;ure in
parting with a nutritious fluid; and the offspring in receiving it!</P>
<P>VII. 1. The wax is another vegetable &s;ecretion produced with
the fecundating du&s;t on the anthers of flowers, which in wet
&s;ea&s;ons it pre&s;erves from rain, to which it is impenetrable; for the
farina, or fecundating du&s;t of plants; is liable to &s;well if expo&s;ed
to much moi&s;ture, and to bur&s;t its &s;hell; and it either then be|comes
inert and ineffectual, or i$ wa&s;hed away. Whence Mr.
Wahlborn ob&s;erves, that as wheat, rye, and many of the gra&s;&s;es,
<PB N="75" REF="81">
and plantain, lift up their anthers on long filaments; and thus ex|po&s;e
the enclo&s;ed fecundating du&s;t to be wa&s;hed away by the rains;
a &s;carcity of corn is produced in wet &s;ummers; hence the nece&s;|&s;ity
of a careful choice of &s;eed-wheat; as that, which had not
received the du&s;t of the anthers, will not grow, though it may
appear well to the eye.</P>
<P>2. A &s;ub&s;tance &s;imilar to this is &s;aid to be collected from exten|&s;ive
underwoods of the ci&s;tus labdaniferus in &s;ome ea&s;tern coun|tries
by this &s;ingular contrivance; long leathern thongs are tied
to poles, and drawn over the flowers of the&s;e &s;hrubs about noon,
which thus collect the wax or re&s;in with part of the anther-du&s;t,
which adheres to the leathern thongs, and is occa&s;ionally
&s;craped off for u&s;e. Thus in &s;ome degree the depredation of the
bee is imitated, except that &s;he loads her thighs only with the
anther-du&s;t, which according to Mr. John Hunter con&s;titutes the
bee-bread found in hives for the &s;upport of the larva or bee-mag|got;
and that &s;he &s;wallows the wax for the con&s;truction of her
combs, as well as the honey for her winter provender; and thus
every way injures the fecundity of flowers.</P>
<P>3. A wax in America is obtained from the myrica cerifera,
candle-berry myrtle, the berries of which are boiled in water, and
the wax &s;eparates. The &s;eeds of the croton febiferum are lodged
in a kind of tallow; in both the&s;e plants the wax or tallow pro|bably
&s;erves the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving the immature &s;eeds from
moi&s;ture; or like the oil found in flax-&s;eed, rape-&s;eed, and in
many kernels, they may con&s;titute in part the nouri&s;hment of the
new plant.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be ob&s;erved, that Mr. Sparman &s;u&s;pects,
that the green wax-like &s;ub&s;tance on the berries of the myrica ce|rifera
is depo&s;ited by in&s;ects. Voyage to the Cape, V. I. p. 145.
And Du Halde de&s;cribes a white wax made by in&s;ects in great
quantity round the branches of a tree in China, which is called
Tong-t$in. De&s;cript. of China, V. I. p. 230. And la&s;tly, &s;ir
G. Staunton mentions a white wax on a plant in Cochin-China,
which he believes to be &s;trewed on the plant in the form of white
powder, which has this &s;ingular property, that one part of this
white powder mixed with three parts of olive oil made hot, gave
<PB N="76" REF="82">
it when cold the con&s;i&s;tence of bee's-wax. Emba&s;&s;y to China,
Vol I. p. 354.</P>
<P>VIII. 1. Turpentines or bal&s;ams, re&s;ins, and e&s;&s;ential oils, are
analogous to the vegetable &s;ecretions la&s;t mentioned, in their
being inadmi&s;&s;ible with water. Tho&s;e vegetables, which contain
in their ve&s;&s;els the lea&s;t water, bear cold climates the be&s;t; be|cau&s;e
when water is frozen, it occupies more &s;pace than before;
and hence bur&s;ts the bottles which contain it; in the &s;ame manner
when any &s;ucculent vegetable is frozen, its ve&s;&s;els become bur&s;t or
brui&s;ed by the expan&s;ion of the ice, and the plant is de&s;troyed; on
this account tho&s;e parts of plants, which are the mo&s;t juicy, as
the la&s;t &s;hoots ofvines, are &s;oone&s;t de&s;troyed in winter. Hence
many of the evergreen trees of this climate are replete with tur|pentine
or re&s;in, which by occupying the place of &s;o much water,
contributes to their hardine&s;s. There is al&s;o a partial &s;ecretion
of bal&s;am or turpentine in many deciduous plants for the purpo&s;e
of defending their buds during the winter, both from fro&s;t and
from wet, which is repelled by their bal&s;amic varni&s;h, as on the
buds of the populus tacamahacca.</P>
<P>2. The bal&s;ams and re&s;ins of the &s;hops are either extracted
from the wood by fire, or ex&s;ude from wounds of the tree; thus
what is called Venice turpentine is obtained from the larch by
wounding the bark about two foot from the ground, and catch|ing
it as it ex&s;udes. Sandarach is procured from common juniper,
and incen&s;e from another juniper; and there is rea&s;on to believe
that bi$$men or petroleum, with jet, amber, and all the fo&s;&s;ile
coal in the world, owes its inflammable part to the recrements of
de&s;troyed fore&s;ts of terebinthisate vegetables, &s;o important to the
pre&s;ent race of mankind has been this vegetable &s;ecretion!</P>
<P>3. The e&s;&s;ential oils are &s;ometimes rai&s;ed by di&s;tillation from
bal&s;ams or re&s;ins, as oil of turpentine; but are chiefly extracted
from flowers; where their office has been to prevent the depre|dations
of in&s;ects; though many of them are &s;o agreeable to the
human &s;en&s;e of &s;mell, when the&s;e e&s;&s;ential oils are di&s;&s;olved or
mixed with water in di&s;tillation, they have been called the &s;piri|tus
rector of the plant, and con&s;titute the odour of it, whether,
aromatic or fetid.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e e&s;&s;ential oils po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t poi&s;onous qualities,
as tho&s;e of lauro-cera&s;us, and of tobacco; and are u&s;ed by Indian
<PB N="77" REF="83">
nations for the purpo&s;e of poi&s;oning their weapons, which they
cover like a varni&s;h. And hence &s;ome of the re&s;inous woods are
&s;aid never to be devoured by in&s;ects, as the unperi&s;hable che&s;ts
of cypre&s;s, in which the Egyptian mummies have been pre&s;erved
for &s;o many ages, and the cedar in which black lead is inclo&s;ed
for pencils.</P>
<P>The acrid poi&s;on of the large euphorbium of Africa exi&s;ts in
the oil of that plant; as M. Vaillant ob&s;erves, that the natives
&s;ometimes poi&s;on the waters with &s;licing this plant into them, and
that the poi&s;onous oil &s;wims upon the &s;urface, and may thus be
avoided by a careful drinker. This in a country where water is
&s;carce, and generally in &s;tagnant pools, may be readily effected;
as a few &s;poonfuls of oil will cover a large &s;heet of water, as it be|comes
diffu&s;ed upon it without friction, as mentioned in Botanic
Garden, Vol. I. Addition. Note XXIX.</P>
<P>4. Some of the e&s;&s;ential olis are &s;o inflammable as to bur&s;t into a
vehement flame on being mixed with nitrous acid, as oil of cloves;
and even the &s;mall quantity diffu&s;ed in the air round the dictam|nus
fraxinella will take fire on a &s;till evening at the approach of
a lighted candle.</P>
<P>5. With the&s;e &s;hould be arranged the ela&s;tic re&s;in called Caout|chouc,
which is &s;aid to ex&s;ude from a tree in Guaiana, called Ia|tropha
ela&s;tica, by M. de la Borde, phy&s;ician at Cayenne. A
&s;imilar ela&s;tic re&s;in is &s;aid to be obtained from a plant in Mada|ga&s;car,
called Finguere, a kind of wild fig-tree, according to
Abbe Rochon; and the bird-lime extracted from the bark of
the hollies of our climate &s;eems to be a &s;imilar material; as like
the caoutchouc it becomes &s;oft by heat, and is impenetrable by
water, but &s;oluble in ether. Another elastic &s;ub&s;tance, which
is in&s;oluble in water, is procured from wheat by long ma&s;tication,
or by agitating the flour of it in water; which has been &s;aid to
approach to animal matter, and is believed to be the mo&s;t nutri|tious
part of that aliment, and was once much talked of, or &s;old
under the name of alimentary powder for the nouri&s;hment of
marching armies.</P>
<P>IX. 1. The bitter, narcotic, and acrid juices of plants are
&s;ecreted by their glands for the defence of the vegetable from the
depredation of in&s;ects and of larger animals. Opium is found
in the leaf, &s;talk, and head of the poppy but not in the &s;eeds.
<PB N="78" REF="84">
A &s;imilar narcotic quality exi&s;ts in the leaf and &s;tem of hyo&s;cy|amus,
hen-bane, but not in the &s;eeds. An acrid juice exi&s;ts in
bu&s;ks of walnuts, and in the pellicle, or &s;kin of the kernel; but
not in the lobes, or nutritious part of it. The&s;e &s;eem to have
been excluded from the &s;eed, le&s;t they might have been injurious
to the tender organs of dige&s;tion of the embryon plant. In &s;ome
&s;eeds, however there is a bitter quality, but which refu&s;es to mix
with the oleagenous part; as the oil expre&s;&s;ed from bitter almonds
is as ta&s;tele&s;s as that from the &s;weet almonds.</P>
<P>2. Other vegetables po&s;&s;e&s;s glands adapted to the &s;ecretion of
various fluids more or le&s;s aromatic, acrid, or a&s;tringent; as the
herb of water-cre&s;s, the root of hor&s;e-radi&s;h, the &s;eeds of mu&s;tard,
the flowers of ro&s;es, the fruit of quince and the bark of oak.
To the&s;e &s;hould be added tho&s;e which have emetic and cathartic
qualities and other vegetable preparations, which are u&s;ed in the
arts of dying, tanning, varni&s;hing; and which &s;upply the &s;hops of
the druggi&s;t with medicines and with poi&s;ons. All which dele|terious
juices &s;eem to have been produced for the protection of
the plant again&s;t its enemies, as appears by the number of poi&s;onous
vegetables, which are &s;een in all our hedge-bottoms and commons,
as hyo&s;cyamus, cynoglo&s;&s;um, jacobaea, and common nettles;
which neither in&s;ects nor quadrupeds devour, and which are
therefore of no known u&s;e but to them&s;elves; and po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;afer
armour in this panapoly of poi&s;on, than the thorns of hollies,
briars and goo&s;eberries.</P>
<P>3. As the bitter, narcotic, acrid, and terebinthinate, as well
as the farinaceous, oily, and &s;accharine matters, are &s;ecreted in
&s;ummer from the vegetable blood, and re&s;erved for the nutrition
and defence of the new buds and bulbs, they are in this climate
generally found more concentrated in the hybernaculum, or win|ter-lodge
of plants, before the new &s;ap is rai&s;ed by the umbilical
or ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els in the &s;pring. Hence roots and barks, as
well as fruits and &s;eeds, are be&s;t collected in autumn, or in winter,
for the purpo&s;es of medicine or of other arts.</P>
<P>Thus the bark of oaks &s;hould be taken off for the u&s;e of the
tanner in the winter, or in early &s;pring, before the leaves pullu|late,
as then a great part of its a&s;tringent or bitter juices is reab|&s;orbed,
and carried to the new foliage along with the &s;accharine
<PB N="79" REF="85">
&s;ap-juice, which has been depo&s;ited in the cells of the alburnum
or &s;ap-wood. But as the barks of trees become loo&s;er, and much
more ea&s;ily detached from the wood, when the &s;ap-juice ri&s;es in
the &s;pring, this is the be&s;t time for debarking them; but the naked
bole and branches &s;hould &s;tand till autumn, till the &s;accharine
matter collected in the alburnum has been expended in unfolding
the new leaves; otherwi&s;e it will &s;oon ferment and putrefy; and
the &s;ap-wood will thus quickly decay by what is termed the dry-rot
of timber, as mentioned in Sect. III. 2. 3.</P>
<P>X. 1. The acids produced by vegetable &s;ecretion have of late
been much &s;ubjected to chemical inquiry, and have been found to
be &s;o numerous, that they have been named from the vegetables,
or parts of vegetables, from which they have been extracted;
as the gallic acid, malic acid, oxalic acid. Many unripe fruits
contain an au&s;tere acid, which is gradually converted into &s;ugar
by vegetable or chemical proce&s;&s;es for the nutriment of their &s;eeds,
as de&s;cribed in No. V. 4. of this &s;ection. In other plants it ex|i&s;ts
in the foot-&s;talks of the leaves, as in rheum, rhubarb; or in
the leaves them&s;elves, as in oxalis, &s;orrel; in the&s;e &s;ituations al&s;o
I &s;uppo&s;e it is &s;creted both for the defence of tho&s;e plants from
the depredation of in&s;ects and of larger animals; and al&s;o for the
purpo&s;e of its being converted into a &s;accharine juice by the di|ge&s;tion
of the young bud in the bo&s;om of the leaf.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE ORGANS OF REPRODUCTION OF VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<Q>The theory of Linneus for vegetable reproduction too mechanical,
and without analogy. Every new fluid is &s;ecreted by glands, as
the liquor amnii and albumen ovi. So al&s;o is the favilla vitae, or
living entity. <HI>I. 1. Lateral progeny.</HI> The new bud is &s;ecret|ed
in the axilla of the leaf, and requires no female apparatus. It
adheres to its parent not by ino&s;culation of ve&s;&s;els, but re&s;embles
the chick in the egg. 2. Difference of the chick and fetus. Their
nutriment and oxygenation. The embryon may be &s;een in the
buds of hor&s;e-che&s;nut. It is a paternal progeny. 3. This late|ral
offspring re&s;embles the parent. Not univer&s;ally &s;o. More
perfect than &s;eeds. Buds of dioecious plants bear &s;imilar &s;exes.
The lateral progeny degenerates from hereditary di&s;ea&s;es. Whence
curled potatoes, blighted &s;trawberries, bears fruit at the &s;ame
time, and of the &s;ame kind. Plants live longer if prevented from
flowering. Art of producing double hyacinths, ranunculus, tu|lips.
4. Lateral progeny of corallines and &s;ea-anemonies.
Polypi are all males. Wires of knot gra&s;s like the joints of the
tape-worm, which are all males. 5. Aphis, viviparous and
oviparous like vegetable generation. 6. Ve&s;&s;els of the bud and
leaf do not ino&s;culate. Viviparous, oviparous, and paternal
generation. 7. Leaves on twigs like the progeny of volvox.
But in &s;ame twigs the pith is divided, and the buds &s;ucce&s;&s;ive.
Hermaphrodite generation. Buds from every part of the caudex.
Tho&s;e from below the graft are like the &s;tock. Find numerous
uteri tike eggs and &s;pawn. Paternal generation preceded &s;exual
generation. The la&s;t more excellent. <HI>II. 1. Sexual progeny.</HI>
Seeds before impregnation. Eggs before impregnation. Seed-embryon
&s;u&s;pended by oppo&s;ite points like the cicatricula of the egg.
2. Seed-bud and flower. Stamens and &s;tigmas. Males bend
to females, and females to males. Style of &s;partium bends round
<PB N="81" REF="87">
like a French horn. Onani&s;m of epilobium. Male flowers of
valli&s;neria &s;wim to the females. Flowers with long filaments
injured by rain. Sub-marine plants project a liquor. 3. The
petals are re&s;piratory organs. 4. Honey is the food of the an|thers
and &s;tigma; which like butterflies propagate and die.
5. Seeds are formed and nouri&s;hed by the umbilical ve&s;&s;els pre|vious
to fecundation, or by the bractes or floral leaves. Di&s;per|&s;ion
of &s;eeds by plumes, by hooks, by twi&s;ted awns. Creep on
the ground. Hygrometer of a geranium &s;eed. 6. Sexual ge|neration
the chef d'oeuvre of nature. Produces variety of &s;pecies.
Mixed breed of cabbage. Mixed breed of beans. An apple
&s;our on one &s;ide. Vegetable mules. 7. Animal mules. They
externally re&s;emble the male, internally the female. Mule from
the hor&s;e and female a&s;s. From the mare and male a&s;s. From
Spani&s;h rams and Swedi&s;h ewes, and the contrary. From the
goat of Angora. Ram without horns. 8. How to improve
the varieties of fruits and flowers, and produce new ones. Many
plants were originally mules, and many animals. How to pro|duce
new animal mon&s;ters, both quadrupeds and fi&s;h, by the
method of Spallanzani. Mules more frequent in antient times.
<HI>III. Vegetable generation.</HI> 1. A triple tree by ingraft|ment.
The caudex of each bud is triple. Lateral or paternal
mules. Conferva fontinalis &s;plits. 2. The lateral propagation
of the polypus. The hydra &s;tentorea &s;plits. Two halves of
different polypi unite. So the vegetable filaments or caudexes in
ingrafted trees. 3. Triple lateral mule. Each part of the
triple caudex is produced from that in its vicinity, not from the
plumula of the bud. 4. Worms multiplied by dividing them. So
the caudexes of the buds of trees. 5. The parts of the long
caudexes of trees are &s;ecreted from the adjoining parts of the
parent caudexes, and combine beneath the cuticle of the tree. Every
part of a compound caudex can produce a new bud, re&s;em|bling
the part of the compound &s;tock, where it ri&s;es. Lateral
mules con&s;i&s;t of parts from three or four parents. Could there
be a threefold &s;exual mule? 6. Power of attraction. Apti|tude
to be attracted. Chemical combinations by &s;ingle at|traction.
By double affinity. 7. Union of animated bo|dies
with inanimate matter, as in &s;wallowing food. In ab|&s;orption

appetencies. Molecules with nutritive propen&s;ities. 8.
Fibrils with formative appetencies, and molecules with formative
propen&s;ities &s;ecreted beneath the cuticle of trees, and coale&s;ce.
Hunger and love, thir&s;t, &s;uckling children, they reciprocally &s;ti|mulate

Formative or nutritive particles in the blood more than nece&s;&s;ary.
Secreted by numerous glands. Arranged under the cuticle of
trees. Acquire new appetencies, and produce new parts. 10.
In &s;exual generation they are &s;ecreted by two glands only. Tho&s;e
of the anther and pericarp unite in the matrix. 11. Without
formative molecules as well as formative fibrils there could be no
mules, or any re&s;emblance to the mother. The new doctrine of
threefold vegetable mules applied to animal generation. 12. Con|clu&s;ion.</Q>
<P>THE theory of Linneus in re&s;pect of the reproduction of ve|getables
maintains, that the internal medullary part mu&s;t be
joined with the external or cortical part of the plant for the
purpo&s;e of producing a new one. If the medulla be &s;o vigorous
as to bur&s;t through its containing ve&s;&s;els, and thus mix with
the cortical part, a bud is produced either on the branches or
roots of vegetables; otherwi&s;e the medulla is extended, till it
terminates in the pi&s;tillum, or female part of the flower; and
the cortical part is likewi&s;e elongated, till it terminates in the
anthers, or male part of the flower; and then the fecundating
du&s;t from the latter being joined to the prolific juices of the
former, produces the &s;eeds or new plants; at the &s;ame time the
inner rind is extended into the corol or petal, and the outer
bark into the calyx.</P>
<P>After the &s;eeds are thus produced, the parent bud dies; and
in this re&s;pect the buds bear a very great analogy to tho&s;e an|nual
in&s;ects, which change from their caterpillar or larva-forms,
putting forth painted wings and organs of reproduction, and
after depo&s;ing their eggs cea&s;e to exi&s;t. See the account of
the vegetable kingdom by Linneus, prefixed to the &s;y&s;tem of
vegetables tran&s;lated by a botanical &s;ociety at Lichfield, Leigh
and Sotheby, London.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="89">
However &s;imple and ingenious the fir&s;t part of this theory
may appear, in which the medulla is &s;uppo&s;ed to extend it&s;elf,
till it bur&s;ts the inclo&s;ing or cortical part, and joining with that
produces a new bud; yet it &s;eems too mechanical for a living
organized &s;y&s;tem; and &s;o totally different from any thing we
know of &s;exual production either in animals or flowers, as not
readily to &s;atisfy a rea&s;oning mind.</P>
<P>Every new fluid or &s;olid produced in the organic &s;y&s;tem of
vegetable or animal bodies is &s;ecreted from their blood, as the
various fluids of bile, &s;aliva, tears, in animals; and tho&s;e of
gum, re&s;in, &s;ugar, in vegetables. Among&s;t the&s;e are the juices
which con&s;titute the nutritious fluid of the amnios in the ute|rus
of viviparous animals, or that of the albumen of the egg in
oviparous ones. And la&s;tly, the flavilla vitae, the new &s;park of
being, or living entity, is al&s;o &s;ecreted from the blood of male
animals by adapted glands to be received into a proper nidus,
and nouri&s;hed by the female.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>I. LATERAL PROGENY.</HEAD>
<P>1. As the leaf with its petiole, or foot-&s;talk, and its caudex
down the bark of a tree, with its radicle beneath, con&s;titutes
an individual plant; and the bud in its bo&s;om &s;ucceeds, and is
evidently produced by it; it may be concluded from the &s;tronge&s;t
analogy that this new progeny is &s;ecreted from a gland or glands
of the parent; and that, as it adheres to the parent, it requires
no female apparatus for its reception, nouri&s;hment, or oxyge|nation.</P>
<P>I was formerly induced to believe, that there was a commu|nication
of blood, or ino&s;culation of ve&s;&s;els between the parent
leaf, and the new bud in its bo&s;om, as expre&s;&s;ed in Zoonomia
Sect XXXIX. 2. 2. and that this con&s;tituted the difference
between paternal ge&s;tation and maternal ge&s;tation. But that
the ve&s;&s;els between the new bud and the parent leaf-bud do
not ino&s;culate may be well &s;een by taking away the bark of the
foot-&s;talk of a leaf, and of the new bud in its bo&s;om; as the re|mains
of the arteries of the late leaf, as well as the rudiment of
the new bud, are &s;een to terminate in the alburnum, or to pe|netrate
<PB N="84" REF="90">
the pith, but without any apparent communication; and
I therefore &s;u&s;pect, that the embryon bud is not &s;erved with
vegetable blood from the ve&s;&s;els of the parent, but that it ac|quires
both nutriment and oxygenation much in the &s;ame man|ner
as the chick in the egg. See Sect. III. 1. 5.</P>
<P>2. The condition of the chick in the egg differs from that
of the fetus in the womb of viviparous animals in the whole of
its nutriment being at fir&s;t provided for it, which con&s;i&s;ts of the
albumen, or white of the egg, which is contained in cells, and
is of different degrees of con&s;i&s;tency, that which is mo&s;t fluid
being fir&s;t con&s;umed; whereas the liquor amnii, or nutriment of
the fetus in utero, is gradually &s;ecreted by adapted glands from
the blood of the mother, as it is wanted.</P>
<P>Another difference between the condition of the chick and
of the fetus con&s;i&s;ts in the manner, by which their blood acquires
its nece&s;&s;ary oxygenation. In the fetus this is done by means
of the placental ve&s;&s;els, who&s;e extremities are in&s;erted into the
blood-ve&s;&s;els of the uterus, and receive oxygen through their
moi&s;t membranes from the pa&s;&s;ing currents of the mother's
blood, as de&s;cribed in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXXVIII.
Whereas in the egg after a few days a incubation a membrane
is &s;een, which includes the albumen, and &s;preads the extremi|ties
of its fine blood-ve&s;&s;els on the moi&s;t membrane, which co|vers
the air at the broad end of the egg; which air is occa&s;ion|ally
renewed, as would appear by its being &s;een &s;o ea&s;ily to pa&s;s
through the &s;hell, when an egg is covered with water in the
exhau&s;ted receiver of an air-pump.</P>
<P>The condition of the embryon bud, when the parent leaf-bud
dies, I conceive to be &s;imilar to that of the chick in the egg,
when that is &s;eparated from its parent. Each of them has at
his time a re&s;ervoir of nutriment provided for it; that of the
chick con&s;i&s;ts of the albumen, or white of the egg above men|t$$ned;
and that of the bud con&s;i&s;ts of mucilage and &s;ugar, which
ar$ depo&s;ited in the alburnum or &s;ap-wood, or in the roots of
the plant. And &s;econdly, I conceive that the extremities of
a fine &s;y&s;tem of ve&s;&s;els belonging to the bud may terminate on
the moi&s;t membrane, which covers the horizontal air-ve&s;&s;els
as de&s;cribed in Sect. III. 2. 6. as tho&s;e on the chorion of the
<PB N="85" REF="91">
chick terminate on the air-bag of the egg, and thus acquire the
nece&s;&s;ary oxygenation of their vegetable blood.</P>
<P>This analogy between the vegetable and animal fetus in re|&s;pect
to their production, nouri&s;hment, and oxygenation, is as
forcible in &s;o ob&s;cure a &s;ubject, as it is curious; and may in large
buds, as of the hor&s;e-che&s;nut, be almo&s;t &s;een by the naked eye.
If with a penknife the remaining rudiment of the la&s;t year's leaf,
and of the new bud in its bo&s;om, be cut away &s;lice by &s;lice,
the &s;even ribs of the la&s;t year's leaf will be &s;een to have ari&s;en
from the pith in &s;even di&s;tinct points, making a curve; and the
new bud to have been produced in their center, and to have
pierced the alburnum and bark, and grown without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of a mother.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, by in part cutting, and in part tearing, the pith
and alburnum from the bottom of a new leaf-&s;talk of hor&s;e-che&s;|nut
about the middle of May, an oval prominence may be &s;een
in the internal part of the leaf-&s;talk, which fills up a &s;pace
between the ve&s;&s;els of the bottom of the leaf-&s;talk and tho&s;e of
the new bud, and &s;eems to connect them by its extremities, and
to pre&s;s on the pith beneath it. From this apparent gland I
conjecture that the now living fibres, or animalcules, are pro|bably
&s;ecreted, which form the new bud adhering to the pith,
and nouri&s;hed by the parent leaf; that thus a paternal progeny
is produced without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a mother.</P>
<P>3. This paternal offspring of vegetables in their buds and
bulbs is attended with a very curious circum&s;tance; and that is,
that they exactly re&s;emble their parents, as is ob&s;ervable in graft|ing
fruit-trees, and in propagating flower-roots; whereas the
&s;eminal offspring of plants, being generated by two parents, and
certainly &s;upplied with nutriment by the mother, is liable to
perpetual variation. This al&s;o in the vegetable cla&s;s dioecia,
where the male flowers are produced on one tree, and the fe|males
on another, the buds of the male-trees uniformly produce
either male flowers, or other buds &s;imilar to them&s;elves; and
the buds of the female trees either produce female flowers, or
other buds &s;imilar to them&s;elves; whereas the &s;eeds of the&s;e
trees produce either male or female plants. See Sect. III. 2. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="92">
This &s;imilarity of buds and bulbs to their parents is to be
under&s;tood only to exi&s;t after the maturity of the plant, that is
after it has produced a &s;exual offspring in flowers and &s;eeds;
for a bulb, as of a tulip, and a bud of a fruit-tree, when fir&s;t
rai&s;ed from their &s;eeds, are very &s;mall, but produce one or more
improved bulbs, or improved buds annually, for &s;ome years;
which differ from their parent bulbs or buds in the &s;ize, form,
and colour of their leaves, till it arrives at its maturity, or ac|quires
the power of generating a &s;exual progeny; from whence
it appears, that the leaf-buds of tho&s;e trees, and the leaf-bulbs
of tho&s;e roots, which have acquired their puberty, if it may be
&s;o called; that is, their power of generating flowers, are a more
perfect progeny than the &s;eeds of tho&s;e plants, as the&s;e latter,
when &s;eparated from their parent either by tran&s;plantation or by
ingrafting, can immediately produce &s;eeds, or a &s;exual progeny;
but the buds from many &s;eeds are &s;ome years before they can
produce &s;eeds. The &s;ame is probably true of many annual or
biennial plants, as of wheat; which produce many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
buds upon each other previous to the flower-bud, as appears by
the joints of the &s;tem; all which may be con&s;idered as individual
plants growing on each other like the annual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the
buds of trees.</P>
<P>Another curious occurrence in this lateral production of vege|tables
by their buds has been lately publi&s;hed by Mr. Knight
in the Phil. Tran&s;. for the year 1795, who ob&s;erves that tho&s;e
apple-trees, which have been continually propagated for above
a century by ingrafting, are now become &s;o di&s;ea&s;ed by canker,
or otherwi&s;e, that though the fruit continues of the &s;ame flavour,
the trees are not worth propagating; as the&s;e grafts, though
tran&s;planted into other trees, he e&s;teems to be &s;till an elonga|tion
of the original tree, and mu&s;t feel the effect of age like the
tree they were taken from. If this idea &s;hould prove true on
further examination, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the &s;ame may
occur in the too long propagation of plants from bulbs and wires,
as potatoes and &s;trawberries, which may have occa&s;ioned the
curled tops of potatoes, and the black blight in the flowers of
the hautbois &s;trawberry, which &s;ome have a&s;cribed to its only
bearing male flowers; the cure of which mu&s;t ari&s;e from our
<PB N="87" REF="93">
applying to other varieties more lately derived from a &s;eminal
offspring.</P>
<P>This degeneracy of trees or perennial herbaceous plants pro|pagated
by buds or root-&s;cions is not I think to be a&s;cribed &s;im|ply
to the age of the original &s;eedling-tree, becau&s;e each &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
generation of buds or bulbs are as di&s;tinct from the parent
as the generation by &s;eeds. But as the lateral progeny of ve|getables
have no &s;ource of improvement after they have arrived
at their maturity, but are liable like other plants and animals to
injuries from food and climate, which injuries produce here|ditary
di&s;ea&s;es, it is to this circum&s;tance that their degeneracy
ought rather to be a&s;cribed; whereas the &s;exual progeny of
vegetables are liable to improvement by the intermixture of the
individuals of the &s;ame, or even of different &s;pecies to counter|act
the effects of hereditary di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Another curious &s;imilarity which buds bear to their parent
tree is al&s;o ob&s;erved by Mr. Knight, Phil. Tran&s;. for 1795,
Part II. p. 292. &startq;Cuttings from &s;eedling apple-trees of two
years old were in&s;erted on &s;tocks of twenty years old,&endq; and in
a bearing &s;tate; but the&s;e have now been grafted nine years; and,
though they have been frequently tran&s;planted to check their
growth, they have not yet produced a &s;ingle blo&s;&s;om. I have
&s;ince grafted &s;ome very old trees with cuttings from &s;eedling
apple-trees of five years old. Their growth has been extremely
rapid, and there appears no probability that their time of pro|ducing
fruit will be accelerated, or that their health will be in|jured
by the great age of the &s;tocks. A &s;eedling apple-tree
u&s;ually bears fruit in thirteen or fourteen years; and I therefore
conclude, that I have to wait for a blo&s;&s;om, till the trees from
which the grafts were taken, attain that age; though I have
rea&s;on to believe from the form of their buds that they will be
extremely prolific. Every cutting therefore taken from the
apple, and probably from every other tree, will be affected by
the &s;tate of the parent &s;tock. If that be too young to produce
fruit, it will grow with vigour, but will not blo&s;&s;om; and if it
be too old, it will immediately produce fruit, but will never
make a healthy tree, and con&s;equently never answer the inten|tion
of the planter.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="94">
&startq;The durability of the apple and pear I have long &s;u&s;pected
to be different in different varieties; but that none of either
would vegetate with vigour much, if at all, beyond the life of
the parent &s;tock, provided that died from mere old age. The
oak is much more long-lived in the north of Europe than with
us, though the timber is le&s;s durable; the climate of this coun|try,
being colder than its native one, may in the &s;ame way add
to the durability of the elm; which may po&s;&s;ibly be further in|crea&s;ed
by its not producing &s;eeds in this climate; as the life of
many annuals may be increa&s;ed to twice its natural period, if not
more, by preventing their &s;eeding.&endq;</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved above, that the fir&s;t bulb of a tulip rai&s;ed from
&s;eed produces a more perfect bulb annually for five or &s;ix years,
and perhaps more than one le&s;s perfect ones, before it acquires the
power of generating &s;eeds. Now when this period arrives, if
the &s;eed-&s;tem be pinched off, I &s;uppo&s;e that the next year's bulb
or bulbs will become more vigorous or luxuriant, and if this be
continued for three or four years I &s;u&s;pect the double flowers,
which are perhaps owing to a more luxuriant growth, may be
formed; and that in this, with &s;uperfluous nouri&s;hment by ma|nure,
warmth and moi&s;ture, con&s;i&s;ts the art of obtaining hyacinths,
ranunculus, and &s;ometimes tulips with &s;uch wonderful multiplica|tion
of petals or nectaries. See Sect. XIX. 3. 1.</P>
<P>4. The analogy which exi&s;ts between this lateral production
of vegetables and that of &s;ome tribes of in&s;ects, is worth
inve&s;tigation. 1. This paternal or lateral generation of plants,
which con&s;titutes the buds on the &s;tems of trees, and the &s;cions
on their roots, which continue to adhere to them, are &s;o far re|&s;embled
by the branching in&s;ects, which form the corals or co|rallines;
and by many other &s;ea-animals, as the &s;ea anemonies,
which are &s;aid to adhere to the &s;hores, or &s;ubmarine earth, by one
extremity, while they pullulate, or &s;pread out by the other into
living ramifications of unmea&s;urable lengths.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have attended to the habits of the polypus, which
is found in the &s;tagnant water of our ditches in July, affirm, that
the young ones branch out from the &s;ide of the parent like the
buds of trees; and after a time &s;eparate them&s;elves from them.
This is &s;o analogous to the manner in which the buds of trees
<PB N="89" REF="95">
appear to be produced, that the&s;e polypi may be con&s;idered as
all male animals, producing embryons, which require no mother
to &s;upply them with a nidus, or with nutriment and oxygenation.</P>
<P>Secondly, this paternal or lateral vegetable progeny is beauti|fully
&s;een in the wires of knot-gra&s;s, polygonum aviculare; and
in tho&s;e of &s;trawberries, fragaria ve&s;ca; and in the roots of po|tatoes.
The lateral generation of the&s;e plants by wires, while
each new plant is thus chained to its parent, and continues to
put forth another and another, as the wire creeps onward on or
beneath the ground, is exactly re&s;embled by the tape-worm, or
taenia, &s;o often found in the bowels, &s;tretching it&s;elf in a chain
quite from the &s;tomach to the rectum. Linneus a&s;&s;erts, &startq;that
it grows old at one extremity, while it continues to generate
young ones at the other, proceeding ad infinitum, like a root of
gra&s;s. The &s;eparate joints are called gourd-worms, and propa|gate
new joints like the parent without end, each joint being fur|ni&s;hed
with its proper mouth and organs of dige&s;tion.&endq; Sy&s;tema
Naturae, vermes, tenia: In this animal there evidently appears a
power of reproduction without any maternal apparatus for the
purpo&s;e of &s;upplying nutriment and oxygenation to the embryon,
as it remains attached to its father till its maturity, and in this
re&s;pect exactly re&s;embles the lateral generation of vegetables.</P>
<P>5. This &s;ubject of the lateral production of vegetables from
male parents without the intervention of a female is further re|&s;embled
by the innumerable progeny of the aphis, which ri&s;es
from an egg in the &s;pring, as a vegetable ri&s;es from a &s;eed, and
produces a viviparous offspring for many generations like the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
buds of a &s;eedling apple-tree, or of a &s;eedling tulip; and
then it generates both males and females, which copulate and de|po&s;it
eggs, like the anthers and &s;tigmas of flowers, and their con|&s;equent
&s;eeds; which at length appear on &s;eedling apple-trees and
on &s;eedling tulips; as is further &s;poken of in Sect. IX. 2. 7. and
XIV. 1. 6.</P>
<P>6. Whence I conclude, that in &s;exual viviparous generation
the new entity, or embryon, is &s;ecreted by the male, and received
into a nidus prepared for it by the female, and nouri&s;hed by fluids,
&s;ecreted into the uterus, as they are required, which is probably
owing to the &s;timulus of the fetus again&s;t the &s;ides of it; that in
<PB N="90" REF="96">
&s;exual oviparous generation a re&s;ervoir of nutriment is prepared,
and inclo&s;ed in the egg previous to the reception of the embryon,
which is &s;ecreted by the mule, and depo&s;ited in this re&s;ervoir of
autriment; becau&s;e the fetus in the&s;e animals is to be &s;eparated
from the parent before its due maturity; and the egg, in which it
is inclo&s;ed, may be con&s;idered as an uterus, or womb, &s;eparated
from the mother. And la&s;tly, that in paternal or male generation
the new entity, or embryon, is as certainly &s;ecreted from a gland
of the male, but probably remains in an adapted re&s;ervoir belonging
to this gland, corre&s;pondent to the ve&s;ic$lae &s;eminales of mo&s;t vivi|parous
animals, and that here it exi&s;ts like the cicatricula in the
egg, and has a re&s;ervoir of nutriment prepared for it like that in
the egg to &s;upport it; when the paternal leaf-bud by its death is &s;e|parated
from it in the autumn, as the egg is &s;eparated from its
living mother.</P>
<P>7. The production of buds in the axilla of every leaf may thus
be ea&s;ily conceived, as the new buds are furni&s;hed with their
caudexes or bark-filaments over tho&s;e of their dead parents, which
&s;hoot out root-fibres beneath in the en&s;uing &s;pring, and that I
&s;uppo&s;e both in deciduous plants and in evergreens; as in the
latter al&s;o I believe the parent leaf-bud annually falls off, though
not by the immediate influence of the cold of autumn. But how
long a twig or &s;cion of leaves, as in the vine or willow, &s;ucceed
each other, &s;ome producing embryon buds in their bo&s;oms before
others become expanded, is not ea&s;y to under&s;tand; but the em|bryons
of all the&s;e new leaves, though not of the buds in their
bo&s;oms, probably exi&s;ted in the paternal womb, though in differ|ent
degrees of maturity, which accords with the ob&s;ervations of
&s;ome naturali&s;ts on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations of the volvox globa|tor,
which Linneus a&s;&s;erts to be diaphanous, and that it carries
within it&s;elf &s;ons and grand&s;ons to the fifth generation, but which
are probably living fetu&s;es produced by the father, of different
degrees of maturity, and to be detruded at different periods of
time like the unimpregnated eggs of various &s;izes, which are found
in poultry. See Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXXIX. 2. and
Linn$i Sy&s;tem. Naturae. Vermes. Volvox.</P>
<P>In &s;ome trees however, as in the vine, vitis, and in many her|baceous
plants, as in wheat, &s;outhi&s;tle, tea&s;el, triticum, &s;onchus,
dypfacus, each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive joint of the plant is evidently an indivi|dual
<PB N="91" REF="97">
vegetable being; becau&s;e the pith, which con&s;titutes the
brain or &s;pinal marrow of each individual, terminates at every
joint by a divi&s;ion, as &s;poken of in Sect. I. 8. whence in the&s;e
vegetables every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive joint appears to be produced by that
beneath it; whereas where there is no divi&s;ion of the pith, the
twig &s;eems to be &s;imply an elongation of the caudex of the leaf-bud,
like the wires of &s;trawberries and other creeping plants.</P>
<P>It &s;hould neverthele&s;s be added, that there are many herma|phrodite
in&s;ects, as &s;hell-&s;nails and dew-worms, which contain both
male and female organs of generation; and as they are perpetually
&s;een to copulate with each other, it is believed, that they can not
impregnate them&s;elves. Now it may be conceived, that the buds
of trees po&s;&s;e&s;s both male and female organs of generation, and
that they can impregnate them&s;elves, and that thus the new buds
might be termed an hermaphrodite offspring rather than a paternal
one. This would however produce a confu&s;ion of terms, as the
eggs of &s;nails and of worms, as mentioned above, are properly an
hermaphrodite offspring.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance occurs in this paternal generation, which
differs from that of tho&s;e hermaphrodite in&s;ects above alluded to,
which is, that though in vegetables the new embryon is gene|rally
produced in the bo&s;om of the leaf-&s;talk, which is believed
to be its parent; yet new buds are occa&s;ionally protruded from
almo&s;t any part of the bark, when the &s;ummit of a branch is taken
off, or the &s;ide branches of a tree, &s;o as to admit light and air,
and a &s;upply of more nutriment; whence it would &s;eem, that
though hermaphrodite in&s;ects po&s;&s;e&s;s but one male and one fe|male
apparatus for the production and reception of the new en|tity
or embryon, yet that in paternal generation the prolific fluid
is occa&s;ionally &s;ecreted in any part of the caudex of each indivi|dual
bud from its &s;ummit on the branch of a tree to its termina|tion
in the root; and that wherever a proper nidus can be found,
which is &s;upplied with nutriment, and expo&s;ed to light and air,
that there the new embryon can adhere and grow; although this
occurs mo&s;t conveniently, and thence mo&s;t frequently, in the
bo&s;om of the leaf-&s;talk, where the prolific fluid is probably fir&s;t
&s;ecreted, and the nutriment mo&s;t copiou&s;ly &s;upplied from the ve|getable
blood newly oxygenated in the leaf. In this I &s;uppo&s;e
to con&s;i&s;t the great difference between paternal and &s;exual genera|tion;
<PB N="92" REF="98">
and that this mode of reproduction forms an exception to
the general axiom of the great Harvey, &startq;all things from eggs.&endq;</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of a power of generation in every part of the
caudex of a vegetable bud from the &s;ummit to the root is not
only &s;hewn by the new buds, which grow on the trunks of trees,
which were felled in the &s;pring, but al&s;o from a curious circum|&s;tance
which occurs in ingrafted trees; which is, that whenever
after many years any new buds or &s;cions grow from the &s;tock be|neath
the graft, it is always &s;imilar to the parent &s;tock, and not
to the ingrafted &s;cion; which &s;hews, that this new bud was ge|nerated
in the old &s;tock, and not that it was owing to an ab&s;orp|tion
and depo&s;ition of a prolific fluid &s;ecreted in any part of the
ingrafted head. It mu&s;t however be remembered, that the cau|dex
of each bud extends from the leaf-&s;talk to the root, whether
it be a &s;imple caudex as in a &s;eedling tree, or a compound one
as in a grafted tree; and that the generation of new buds in pe|rennial
herbaceous plants exi&s;ts in every part of the broad cau|dex
on the root, as it does here in every part of the long caudex
on the trunk. Nothing known in the animal world re&s;embles
this univer&s;ality of the generative faculty throughout almo&s;t the
whole of an individual vegetable being, except the number of
new polypi &s;aid to ari&s;e at the &s;ame time from different parts of
the &s;ame individual animal.</P>
<P>Wherever the new vegetable embryons are &s;ecreted, they al&s;o
find a &s;ituation or uterus, where they can adhere and be nouri&s;hed
to almo&s;t any number; which however is not un&s;upported by &s;ome
analogy even in viviparous animals; as there have been many in|&s;tances
of extra-uterine fetu&s;es, which have attached or in&s;erted
their ve&s;&s;els into the peritoneum, or on the vi&s;cera of the mother,
in the &s;ame manner as they naturally attach or in&s;ert them into the
&s;ides of the true uterus. And in re&s;pect to the number of uteri
produced we may recollect the number of eggs, and of fi&s;h-&s;pawn,
or frog-&s;pawn, or of &s;eeds, which may all be termed &s;o many di&s;|tinct
uteri, as they contain every thing, which is found in the
uteri of viviparous animals.</P>
<P>The aphis, and probably many other in&s;ects, po&s;&s;e&s;s both the
&s;olitary and &s;exual mode of propagation, as is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by mo&s;t
vegetables; but the polypus and tenia, and hydra &s;tentorea, and
<PB N="93" REF="99">
volvox, appear only to be reproduced by the &s;olitary or lateral
generation; and it is probable that the truffle among&s;t vegetables,
and &s;ome &s;ub-marine plants, and others of the cla&s;s cryptogomia,
who&s;e &s;eeds have not been yet di&s;covered, may &s;till be only pro|pagated
by the lateral mode of reproduction, as is well ob&s;erved
in an ingenious work by a lady of very accurate botanic knowledge,
called &startq;Botanic Dialogues, designed for the u&s;e of &s;chools,&endq;
one volume octavo, John&s;on, London; but which may be &s;trongly
recommended to the adult in botany as containing much u&s;eful
information agreeably imparted.</P>
<P>This curious &s;ubject of lateral or &s;olitary generation is well
worthy more accurate inve&s;tigation, as it is the &s;imple&s;t, and was
probably the fir&s;t mode of reproduction which exi&s;ted; and if
any accurate knowledge can ever be acquired of animal genera|tion
it will po&s;&s;ibly occur from a more nice attention to the pro|duction
of the buds and bulbs of vegetables! which is further
&s;poken of in Sect. IX. 2 and 3. And at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t
be ob&s;erved, that the &s;exual reproduction is the chef d'ouvre, the
ma&s;ter-piece of nature, as by the paternal or lateral reproduction
the &s;ame &s;pecies only are propagated ad infinitum; whereas by
the &s;exual mode of reproduction a countle&s;s variety of animals
are introduced into the world, and much plea&s;ure is afforded to
tho&s;e which already exi&s;t in it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>II. SEXUAL PROGENY.</HEAD>
<P>1. We come now to the &s;eminal mode of the production of ve|getables,
which originates from the congre&s;s of the male and fe|male
parts of flowers, and may be therefore termed the &s;exual or
amatorial progeny of vegetation.</P>
<P>From the accurate experiments and ob&s;ervations of Spallanzani
it appears, that in the Spartium Junceum, ru&s;h-broom, the very
minute &s;eeds were di&s;cerned in the pod at lea&s;t twenty days before
the flower is in full bloom; that is, twenty days before fecunda|tion.
At this time al&s;o the powder of the anthers was vi&s;i|ble,
but glued fa&s;t to their &s;ummits. The &s;eeds however at this
time, and for ten days after the blo&s;&s;om had fallen off, appeared
to con&s;i&s;t of a gelatinous &s;ub&s;tance. On the eleventh day after
<PB N="94" REF="100">
the falling of the blo&s;&s;om the &s;eeds became heart &s;haped, with
the ba&s;is attached by an appendage to the pod, and a white point
at the apex; this white point was on pre&s;&s;ure found to be a cavity
including a drop of liquor.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fifth day the cavity, which at fir&s;t appeared at
the apex, was much enlarged, and &s;till full of liquor; it al&s;o
contained a very &s;mall &s;emi-tran&s;parent body of a yellowi&s;h colour,
gelatinous, and fixed by its two oppo&s;ite ends to the &s;ides of the
cavity.</P>
<P>In a month the &s;eed was much enlarged, and its &s;hape changed
from a heart to a kidney; the little body contained in the cavity
was increa&s;ed in bu&s;k, and was le&s;s tran&s;parent, and gelatinous,
but there yet appeared no organization.</P>
<P>On the fortieth day the cavity now grown larger was quite filled
with the body, which was covered with a thin membrane; after
this membrane was removed, the body appeared of a bright green,
and was ea&s;ily divided by the point of a needle into two portions,
which manife&s;tly formed the two lobes; and within the&s;e attached
to the lower part the exceedingly &s;mall plantule was ea&s;ily per|ceived.</P>
<P>The foregoing ob&s;ervations evince, 1. That the &s;eeds exi&s;t in
the ovarium many days before fecundation. 2. That they remain
for &s;ome time &s;olid, and then a cavity containing a liquid is
formed in them. 3. That after fecundation a body begins to ap|pear
within the cavity fixed by two points to the &s;ides, which in
proce&s;s of time proves to be two lobes containing a planticle. 4.
That the ripe &s;eed con&s;i&s;ts of two lobes adhering to a planticle, and
&s;urrounded by a thin membrane, which is it&s;elf covered with a
hu&s;k or cuticle. Spallanzani's Di&s;&s;ertations, Vol. II. p. 253.</P>
<P>The analogy between &s;eeds and eggs has long been ob&s;erved,
and is confirmed by the mode of their production. The egg is
known to be formed within the hen long before its impregnation.
C. F. Wolf a&s;&s;erts, that the yolk of the egg is nouri&s;hed by the
ve&s;&s;els of the mother, and that it has from tho&s;e its arterial and
venous branches; but that after impregnation the&s;e ve&s;&s;els gra|dually
become impervious and obliterated; and that new ones
are produced from the fetus, and di&s;per&s;ed into the yolk. Haller's
Phy&s;iol. Tom. VIII. p. 94. The young &s;eed after fecundation
I &s;uppo&s;e is nouri&s;hed in a &s;imilar manner from the gelatinous
<PB N="95" REF="101">
liquor, which is previou&s;ly depo&s;ited for that purpo&s;e; the uterus
of the plant producing or &s;ecreting it into a re&s;ervoir or amnios,
in which the embryon is lodged; and that the young embryon
is furni&s;hed with ve&s;&s;els to ab&s;orb a part of it, as in the very
early &s;tate of the embryon in the egg.</P>
<P>Another curious analogy &s;eems to exi&s;t between the embryon
of the &s;eed and of the egg in their mode of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. The
cicatricula of the egg re&s;ts on the yolk, which is &s;u&s;pended by
two points, called chalazae, &s;omewhat above its center of
gravity; whence, however the egg is moved, this embryon is
always kept upwards, probably the better to receive the warmth
of the mother during incubation. The &s;eed embryon &s;eems to
be &s;upported in the &s;ame manner by the above relation of Spal|lanzani
by two points, and may thus receive a greater warmth
from the &s;ummer &s;un.</P>
<P>2. The &s;eeds are thus produced in their unimpregnated &s;tate in
the vegetable uterus, and nouri&s;hed by the flower-bud, which
was formed in the deciduous trees of this climate during the
preceding &s;ummer, and which now puts forth the bractes, or
floral-leaves, for the oxygenation of its blood; and protrudes
its roots and ab&s;orbents into the ground from the lower part of
its caudex, for the purpo&s;e of acquiring nouri&s;hment; and on
the &s;ummit of this &s;exual apparatus are at the &s;ame time pro|duced
the corol and nectaries of the flower, with the &s;tamens, and
&s;tigmas, which are evidently de&s;igned to give fecundation to
the vegetable &s;eeds, or eggs, previou&s;ly depo&s;ited in the peri|carp
or uterus; becau&s;e, as &s;oon as the&s;e are impregnated, the
corol and nectaries, with the &s;tamens, and &s;tigmas, fall off and
di&s;appear.</P>
<P>The anthers have been proved by many experiments to be
nece&s;&s;ary to the fecundation of the vegetable &s;eeds by the farina,
or du&s;t, which they di&s;per&s;e, and which adheres to the moi&s;t
&s;tigma on the &s;ummit of the &s;tyle or pericarp. The amatorial
attachment between the&s;e &s;tigmas and the anthers on the &s;um|mits
of the &s;tamens has attracted the notice of all botani&s;ts. In
many flowers the anthers or males bend into contact with the
&s;tigmas or females, as in kalmia, fritillaria per&s;ica,
parna&s;&s;ia, cactus, and ci&s;tus. In the kalmia the ten &s;tamens lie round
<PB N="96" REF="102">
the pi&s;til, like the radii of a wheel, and each anther is conceal|ed
in a nich of the corol to protect it from cold and moi&s;ture;
the&s;e anthers ri&s;e &s;eparately from their niches, and approach the
&s;tigma of the pi&s;til for a time, and then recede to their former
&s;ituations. In $h$ fritillaria per&s;ica the &s;ix &s;tamens are of equal
lengths, and the anthers lie at a di&s;tance from the pi&s;til; of
the&s;e three alternate ones approach fir&s;t, and &s;urround the fe|male;
and when the&s;e decline, the other three approach; and
in parna&s;&s;ia the males alternately approach and recede from the
female; and la&s;tly in the mo&s;t beautiful flowers of cactus gran|diflorus;
and of ci&s;tus labdaniferous, where the males are very
numerous, &s;ome of them are perpetually bent into contact with
the female; and as they recede, others advance.</P>
<P>In other flowers the females bend into contact with the males,
as in nigella, epilobium, &s;partium, collin&s;onia. In nigella, devil
in the bu&s;h, the females are very tall compared to the males,
and bending down over them in a circle, give the flower &s;ome
re&s;emblance to a regal crown. The female of the epilobium
angu&s;tifolium, willow-herb, bends down among&s;t the males for
&s;everal days, and becomes upright again when impregnated. In the &s;partium &s;coparium, common broom, the males or &s;tamens
are in two &s;ets, one &s;et ri&s;ing a quarter of an inch above the
other. The upper &s;et does not arrive at their maturity &s;o &s;oon
as the lower; and the &s;tigma, or head of the female, is pro|duced
among&s;t the upper or immature &s;et. But as &s;oon as the
pi&s;til grows tall enough to bur&s;t open the keel-leaf, or head of
the flower, it bends it&s;elf round in an in&s;tant like a French
horn, and in&s;erts its head, or &s;tigma, among&s;t the lower or ma|ture
&s;et of males. The pi&s;til or female then continues to grow
in length; and in a few days the &s;tigma arrives again among&s;t
the upper &s;et, by the time they become mature. This wonder|ful
contrivance is readily &s;een by opening the keel-leaf of the
flowers of broom before they bur&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly. And la&s;tly,
in the collin&s;onia the two males widely diverging from each
other, the female bends her&s;elf into contact fir&s;t with one of
them; and after a day or two leaves this, and applies her&s;elf
to the other; the anther of which was not mature &s;o &s;oon as
the former. See Sect. VIII. 8. of this work.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="103">
Dr. Pe&s;chier of Geneva thinks, he has di&s;countenanced this
idea of amatorial &s;en&s;ibility of vegetables by two experiments,
which are related in Journal de Phy&s;ique de Lametherie, T. II.
p. 343. One of the&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of his tying down the &s;tigma
of epilobium angu&s;tifolium, and yet in due time the anthers
bur&s;t and &s;hed their pollen, and thus committed a kind of vege|table
Onani&s;m; and al&s;o that he ca&s;trated the &s;tamens of this
flower, and yet the &s;tigma opened and aro&s;e, as if the anthers
had been pre&s;ent. The other experiment con&s;i&s;ted in his con|fining
a branch of barbery, berberis, in a gla&s;s, and &s;ubjecting
the &s;tamina of the flowers to the vapour of nitrous acid, which
by this &s;timulus aro&s;e from their petals to the &s;tigma, and after
a few minutes again retired to their petals. Both the&s;e experi|ments
rather &s;eem to confirm than to enfeeble the analogy be|tween
plants and animals; as the amatorial motions of the&s;e
flowers were thus produced by internal or external &s;timuli, as in
the healthy or di&s;ea&s;ed states of animals.</P>
<P>Another mode, in which the prolific du&s;t is di&s;per&s;ed, is by
the bur&s;ting of the anther, and its con&s;equent diffu&s;ion in air,
either &s;o as to make a cloud near the females, which exi&s;t in
the &s;ame flower, or on the &s;ame plant, which is the mo&s;t u&s;ual
manner; or by its being carried by the winds to a greater di|&s;tance,
as in the flowers of the cla&s;s monoecia, or one hou&s;e. So
in urtica, nettle, the male flowers are &s;eparate from the female,
and the anthers are &s;een in fair weather to bur&s;t with force,
and to di&s;charge their du&s;t, which hovers about the plant like a
cloud.</P>
<P>In plants of the cla&s;s dioecia, or two hou&s;es, the fecundating
farina is carried to the di&s;tance of many miles by the winds, as
has been proved by the impregnation of &s;ome female date trees,
which were at a great di&s;tance from the male ones. And the
male flowers them&s;elves of valli&s;neria are carried many miles
down the rivers, which it inhabits, to the female ones. This
plant has its roots at the bottom of the Rhone; the flowers of
the female plant float on the &s;urface of the water, and are fur|ni&s;hed
with an ela&s;tic &s;piral &s;talk, which extends or contracts,
as the water ri&s;es and falls. The flowers of the male plant are
produced under water, and as &s;oon as their farina, or du&s;t, is
<PB N="98" REF="104">
mature, they detach them&s;elves from the plant, and ri&s;e to the
&s;urface, continue to flouri&s;h, and are wafted by the air, or
borne by the currents, to the female flowers. In this re&s;em|bling
tho&s;e tribes of in&s;ects, where the males at certain &s;ea&s;ons
acquire wings, but not the females, as ants, coccus, lampyris,
phalaena, brumata, lichanella. See valli&s;neria in the Families
of plants, tran&s;lated from Linneus. John&s;on, London.</P>
<P>The plants, which grow in the air, are frequently injured
in wet &s;ea&s;ons by the moi&s;ture occa&s;ioning the cells of the an|thers,
which contain the fecundating farina, to bur&s;t, and to
&s;hed it on the ground. To which a &s;carcity of the quantity of
wheat, or an imperfection of its fecundating quality, and the
u&s;tilago, or &s;mut, have rationally been a&s;cribed, as its anthers
are exposed on long filaments to the weather. On this account
many flowers clo&s;e their corols before rain, and the aquatic
plants of rivers perform their impregnations in the air. But M.
Bonnet remarks another method of the di&s;per&s;ion of the fecun|dating
influence of &s;ome marine plants, in which the male organ
does not project a fine powder, but a liquor, which forms a
perceptible cloud in the water; and adds, that the male &s;ala|mander
darts his &s;emen into the water, where it forms a whiti&s;h
cloud, which is afterwards received by the &s;wollen anus of the
female, and &s;he becomes impregnated. Nor is this vegetable
impregnation in water unanalogous to other animal impregna|tions,
as the &s;pawn of frogs and of fi&s;h is delivered from the fe|male
before it is fecundated; and its fecundation is &s;een to &s;uc|ceed
in water; and Spallanzani found, that the &s;eminal fluid
even of dogs, as well as of frogs, retained its prolific quality
when diluted with much water. Bonnet's Oeuvres Philo&s;. in a
letter to Spallanzani.</P>
<P>3. The other parts, which ri&s;e on the edge of the pericarp,
and expand them&s;elves before the impregnation of the &s;eed, are
the corol and nectaries. The former of the&s;e has been &s;hewn
to be a re&s;piratory organ for the purpo&s;e of oxygenating the
blood to a greater degree than in the green foliage, as it is there
expo&s;ed to the air beneath a finer pellicle, and acquires variety
of colours. See Sect. IV. 5. 1. to which may be added, that
as the corol in helleborus niger, Christmas ro&s;e, changes after
<PB N="99" REF="105">
the fecundation of the &s;eed into a calyx, lo&s;ing its white colour,
and becoming green. So in many flowers the calyx falls off
along with the corol; in the&s;e it &s;hould be e&s;teemed a part of
or appendage to the corol; whereas tho&s;e calyxes, which are
permanent after the corol falls off, are properly parts of the
pericarp or vegetable uterus.</P>
<P>4. The nectary, or honey-cup, is evidently an appendage to
the corol, and is the re&s;ervoir of the honey, which is &s;ecreted
by an appropriate gland from the blood after its oxygenation in
the corol, as mentioned in Sect. IV. 5. 5. and is ab&s;orbed for
nutriment by the &s;exual parts of the flower. This purpo&s;e
however has as yet e&s;caped the re&s;earches of philo&s;ophical bo|tani&s;ts.
M. Pontedera believes it de&s;igned to lubricate the
vegetable uterus. (Antholog. p. 49.) Others have &s;uppo&s;ed,
that the honey, when reab&s;orbed, might &s;erve the purpo&s;e of
the liquor amnii, or white of an egg, as a nutriment for the
young embryon, or fecundated &s;eed, in its early &s;tate of exi&s;t|ence.
But as the nectary is found equally general in male
flowers as in female ones, and as the young embryon, or &s;eed,
grows before the petals and nectary are expanded, and after
they fall off; the&s;e &s;eem to be in&s;urmountable objections to both
the above-mentioned opinions.</P>
<P>In many tribes of in&s;ects, as the &s;ilk-worm, and perhaps in
all the moths aud butterflies, the male and female parents die,
as &s;oon as the eggs are impregnated and excluded, the eggs re|maining
to be perfected and hatched at &s;ome future time. The
&s;ame thing happens to the male and female parts of flowers;
the anthers and filaments, which con&s;titute the male parts of the
flower, and the &s;tigma and &s;tyle, which con&s;titute the &s;en&s;itive
or amatorial organ of the female part of the flower, fall off and
die, as &s;oon as the &s;eeds are impregnated, and along with the&s;e
the petals and nectary. Now the moths and butterflies above
mentioned, as &s;oon as they acquire the pa&s;&s;ion and the appara|tus
for the reproduction of their &s;pecies, lo&s;e the power of feed|ing
upon leaves, as they did before, and become nouri&s;hed by
what?&mdash;by honey alone.</P>
<P>Hence we acquire a &s;trong analogy for the u&s;e of the nectary,
or &s;ecretion of honey, in the vegetable economy; which is, that
<PB N="100" REF="106">
the male parts of flowers, and the female parts, as &s;oon as they
leave their fetus-&s;tate, expanding their petals, (which con&s;titute
their lungs) become &s;en&s;ible to the pa&s;&s;ion, and gain the apparatus,
for the reproduction of their &s;pecies; and are fed and nou|ri&s;hed
with honey like the in&s;ects above de&s;cribed; and that
hence the nectary begins its office of producing honey, and dies
or cea&s;es to produce honey, at the &s;ame time with the birth and
death of the anthers and the &s;tigmas; which, whether exi&s;ting
in the &s;ame or in different flowers, are &s;eparate and di&s;tinct ani|mated
beings.</P>
<P>Previous to this time the anthers with their filaments, and
the &s;tigmas with their &s;tyles, are in their fetus-&s;tate &s;u&s;tained in
&s;ome plants by their umbilical ve&s;&s;els, like the unexpanded leaf-buds,
as in colchicum autumnale, and daphne mezereon; and in
other plants by the bractes, or floral-leaves, as in rhubarb, which
are expanded long before the opening of the flower; the &s;eeds
at the &s;ame time exi&s;ting in the vegetable womb yet unimpreg|nated,
and the du&s;t yet unripe in the cells of the anthers. After
this period the petals become expanded, which have been &s;hewn
to con&s;titute the lungs of the flower; the umbilical ve&s;&s;els, which
before nouri&s;hed the anthers and the &s;tigmas, coale&s;ce, or cea&s;e
to nouri&s;h them; and they acquire blood more oxygenated by
the air, obtain the pa&s;&s;ion and power of reproduction, are &s;en&s;i|ble
to heat, and light, and moi&s;ture, and to mechanic &s;timulus,
and become in reality in&s;ects fed with honey; &s;imilar in every
re&s;pect except that all of them yet known but the male flowers
of valli&s;neria, continue attached to the plant, on which they are
produced.</P>
<P>So water in&s;ects, as the gnat, and amphibious animals, as
the tad-pole, acquire new aerial lungs, when they leave their
infant &s;tate for that of puberty. And the numerous tribes of
caterpillars are fed upon the common juices of vegetables found
in their leaves, till they acquire the organs of reproduction; and
then they feed on honey, all I believe except the &s;ilk-worm,
which in this country takes no nouri&s;hment after it becomes a
butterfly. And the larva or maggot of the bee, according to
the ob&s;ervations of Mr. Hunter, is fed with raw vegetable mat|ter,
called bee-bread, which is collected from the anthers of
<PB N="101" REF="107">
flowers, and laid up in cells for that purpo&s;e, till the maggot
becomes a winged bee, acquires greater &s;en&s;ibility, and is fed
with honey. Phil. Tran&s;. 1792.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, though the filaments and &s;tyle, as well as the corolla
and nectary, belonging to the &s;exual organs of vegetables; yet
it is the anthers alone of the &s;tamina, and &s;tigmas alone of the
pi&s;tilla, which po&s;&s;e&s;s the power, and I &s;uppo&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion of
reproduction, as appears from the mutilated filaments of many
flowers, as of curcuma, of linum or flax of this country, of
gratiola, and hemlock-leaved geranium, which have half their
&s;tamina unterminated by anthers, and in con&s;equence produce
no prolific farina. And &s;econdly, from the florets, which form
the rays of the flowers of the order fru&s;traneous polygamy of
the cla&s;s &s;yngene&s;ia, as the &s;un-flower, which are furni&s;hed with
a &s;tyle only, and no &s;tigma, and are thence barren. There is
al&s;o a &s;tyle without a &s;tigma in the whole order of dioecia gynan|dria,
the male flowers of which are thence barren, and &s;hews
the nece&s;&s;ity of the exi&s;tence of the &s;tigma to the fecundation of
the vegetable uterus, probably owing to its amatorial action in
conveying the living principle to the included &s;eeds like the
fallopian tubes of the animal womb.</P>
<P>5. The &s;eeds are produced in the pericarp, and at fir&s;t ac|quire
nutriment by the umbilical ve&s;&s;els previous to their fecun|dation,
like the unexpanded leaf-buds; and then by the caudex
down the bark with its radicles, which is oxygenated by the
bractes, or floral-leaves, as &s;oon as the&s;e are expanded, they
afterwards become in one day impregnated in &s;ome flowers, as
in the oenothera, cactus grandiflorus, and ci&s;tus; and the co|rol
or petals, with the &s;tamens and &s;tigmas, and nectaries, wither
and fall off. In other flowers many days elap&s;e before the
various cells of &s;eeds are fecundated, and the&s;e more animated
parts of &s;exual reproduction peri&s;h. But in all ca&s;es the &s;eeds
remain in the pericarp or uterus after fecundation as before it,
except in tho&s;e plants, which are called proliferous, as the poly|gonum
viviparum, and magical onions, which immediately be|gin
to vegetate; in all other plants the &s;eed either &s;leeps till the
en&s;uing &s;pring, as in the colchicum and hamamelis; or they
continue to grow to maturity, and to be nouri&s;hed in the peri|carp
<PB N="102" REF="108">
by the blood of the parent flower-bud, which is oxygenated
in the bractes or floral-leaves, till they become perfected like
eggs, and fall on the ground, or are otherwi&s;e di&s;per&s;ed, for the
purpo&s;e of taking root in the earth.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that in the &s;exual reproduction of vegeta|bles
the amatorial organ is di&s;tinct from the uterus, as is probably
the ca&s;e in animals; which in female quadrupeds would &s;eem to
&s;leep after impregnation during the time of ge&s;tation and lacte|&s;cence,
and afterwards to revive; whereas this amatorial organ
in vegetable flowers peri&s;hes, when the uterus is impregnated,
along with the male organs, neither of which are any longer of
u&s;e in the&s;e annual beings.</P>
<P>The various methods, which nature has employed for the di&s;|per&s;ion
of &s;eeds, are worth the attention of the farmer and gar|dener,
both for the purpo&s;e of preventing the growth of noxious
&s;eeds, and of collecting the profitable ones. The pericarp of
&s;ome plants bur&s;ts with &s;udden violence, when the &s;eed is mature,
and di&s;per&s;es it to con&s;iderable di&s;tance; as that of wood-&s;orrel,
oxalis acetocalla; and of impatiens, touch me not. The &s;eeds
of many plants of the cla&s;s &s;yngene&s;ia are furni&s;hed with a plume,
by which admirable mechani&s;m they are di&s;&s;eminated by the
winds far from their parent &s;tem, and look like a &s;huttlecock, as
they fly. Other &s;eeds are di&s;&s;eminated by animals; of the&s;e
&s;ome attach them&s;elves to their hair or feathers by a gluten, as
mi&s;letoe; others by hooks, as clivers, galium aperine; burdock,
arctium lappa; hound's-tongue, cynoglo&s;&s;um. Others are &s;wal|lowed
whole for the &s;ake of the fruit, and voided uninjured, as
the hawthorn, crataegus juniper and &s;ome gra&s;&s;es. And the
&s;eeds of aquatic plants, and of tho&s;e which grow on the banks
of rivers, are carried many miles by the currents into which they
fall.</P>
<P>Other &s;eeds are &s;eparated from each other, and di&s;per&s;ed by
the twi&s;ting of the awn at the &s;ummit of them, when moi&s;tened
by rain, as a black oat, avena fatua, with hairy awns which &s;eems
to crawl like an in&s;ect when moi&s;tened; geranium al&s;o, and
barley; and as this happens in wet weather, the moi&s;t ground
is then fit to receive and nouri&s;h them. The awns of the gera|nium
have been u&s;ed as hygrometers by &s;ticking the ba&s;e of the
<PB N="103" REF="109">
&s;eed into a cork for a pede&s;tal, and marking divi&s;ions on a paper
circle beneath it; and the awn of barley is furni&s;hed with &s;tiff
points, which, like the teeth of a &s;aw, are all turned towards one
end of it; as this long awn lies upon the ground, it extends it|&s;elf
in the moi&s;t air of night, and pu&s;hes forward the barley-corn,
which it adheres to; in the day it &s;hortens as it dries;
and as the&s;e points prevent it from receding, it draws up its
pointed end; and thus, creeping like a worm, will travel many
feet from the parent &s;tem; and may thus be u&s;ed as a travelling
hygrometer, when laid on a cloth on the floor like the automa|ton
of Mr. Edgeworth, de&s;cribed in Botanic Garden, article
Impatiens, Vol. II.</P>

to tho&s;e for lateral generation, in vegetables, and in
&s;ome animals, as the polypus, the taenia, and the volvox, &s;eems
the chef d'oeuvre, the ma&s;ter-piece of nature, as appears from
many flying in&s;ects, as moths and butterflies, which &s;eem to un|dergo
a general change of their forms &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of
&s;exual reproduction; and in all other animals the&s;e organs are
not complete till the maturity of the cr$ature; whereas the lateral
generation commences with the infancy of the germ or bud, as
on the roots of young herbs, and on the &s;tems of infant trees.</P>
<P>There &s;eems neverthele&s;s to be one circum&s;tance, in which the
&s;olitary generation of the buds of plants, when the plants are
at their maturity, is &s;uperior to the &s;exual generation by &s;eeds.
This con&s;i&s;ts in the progeny of the former being more perfect
than that of the latter, in re&s;pect to the power of the reproduction
of their &s;pecies. Thus in many plants, as in tulips and ap|ple-trees,
the young vegetable from the &s;eed produces other bulbs,
or buds, for &s;ome years, which &s;eem annually to improve till at
length they acquire a puberty, if it may be &s;o called, and be|come
furni&s;hed with &s;exual organs for the purpo&s;e of &s;eminal re|production;
whereas the leaf-buds, or leaf-bulbs, of the apple-tree
and tulip during their fir&s;t years produce other leaf-buds, or
leaf-bulbs, rather more perfect than their parents; and when the&s;e
bulbs, and buds, arrive at their puberty, or maturity, &s;o as to
be capable of &s;exual generation, their new bulbs and new buds
al&s;o, if taken from their dying parents, and tran&s;planted or in|grafted,

or left adhering to them, are immediately capable of
producing flowers, and a con&s;equent &s;eminal progeny.</P>
<P>As the progeny by lateral generation &s;o exactly re&s;embles the
parent &s;tock, it follows, that though any new variety, or improve|ment,
may be thus continued for a century or two, as in grafted
fruit-trees, yet that no new variety or improvement can be ob|tained
by this mode of generation; though &s;ome hereditary di&s;|ea&s;es,
as the canker, are believed to ari&s;e in ingrafted trees which
have long been propagated by lateral generation as explained in
No. 1. 3. of this Section.</P>
<P>But from the &s;exual, or amatorial, generation of plants new
varieties, or improvements, are frequently obtained; as many of
the young plants from &s;eeds are di&s;&s;imilar to the parent, and &s;ome
of them &s;uperior to the parent in the qualities we wi&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s;
which is another proof that the anthers and &s;tigmas of plants are
animated beings, different from the green foliage of the tree on
which they grow; as they produce varieties in the form of their
offspring like &s;exual animals, which buds do not.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the production of different, and &s;ometimes more excel|lent,
varieties in the &s;pecies of vegetables from &s;eeds, another ad|vantage
occurs from &s;exual generation, which is the production of
new &s;pecies of plants, or mules, by &s;hedding the fecundating du&s;t
of &s;ome flowers on the &s;tigmas of others of a different &s;pecies,
though generally of the &s;ame genus.</P>
<P>A mule cabbage is de&s;cribed in the Bath Agriculture, Vol I.
Art. 4, which is &s;aid to fatten a bea&s;t &s;ix weeks &s;ooner than tur|neps.
It is there &s;aid, &startq;that the &s;ort of cabbage principally
rai&s;ed is the tallow-loaf or drum-head cabbage; but it being too
tender to bear &s;harp fro&s;t, I planted &s;ome of this &s;ort and the
common purple-cabbage u&s;ed for pickling, (it being the hardie&s;t I
am acquainted with) alternately; and when the &s;eed-pods were
perfectly formed, I cut down the purple, and left the other for
&s;eed. This had the de&s;ired effect, and produced a mixt &s;tock of
a deep green colour with purple veins, retaining the &s;ize of the
drum head, and acquiring the hardine&s;s of the purple.&endq;</P>
<P>In another curious paper of the Bath Society, Vol. V. p. 38,
Mr. Wimpey relates, that he planted a field with garden-beans
in rows about three feet a&s;under in the following order, mazagan,
<PB N="105" REF="111">
white-blo&s;&s;om, long-podded, Sandwich-toker, and Wind&s;or-beans.
The mazagan and white-blo&s;&s;om were thre&s;hed fir&s;t,
when to his great &s;urpri&s;e he found many new &s;pecies of beans;
tho&s;e from the mazagan were mottled black and white; the white-blo&s;&s;oms
were brown and yellow in&s;tead of their natural black;
and they were both much larger than u&s;ual. See Sect. XVI. 4.
of this work.</P>
<P>There is an apple de&s;cribed in Bradley's work, which is &s;aid
to have one &s;ide of it a &s;weet fruit, which boils &s;oft, and the
other &s;ide a &s;our fruit which boils hard. This Mr. Bradley &s;o
long ago as the year 1721 ingeniou&s;ly a&s;cribes to the farina of one
of the&s;e apples impregnating the other; which would &s;eem the
more probable, if we con&s;ider, that each divi&s;ion of an apple is a
&s;eparate womb, and may therefore have a &s;eparate impregnation,
like puppies of different kinds in one litter. The &s;ame is &s;aid to
have occurred in oranges and lemons, and grapes of different co|lours.</P>
<P>Vegetable mules are &s;aid to be numerous, and, like the mules
of the animal kingdom, not always to continue their &s;pecies by
&s;eed. There is an account of a curious mule from the antirrhinum
linaria, toad-flax, in the Amoenit. Academ. V. I. No. 3. and
many hybrid plants, are de&s;cribed in No. 32. The urtica alienata
is an evergreen plant; which appears to be a nettle from the male
flowers, and a pellitory (parietaria) from the female ones and the
fruit, and is hence between both. Murray, Sy&s;t. Veg. Among&s;t
the Engli&s;h indigenous plants, the veronica hybryda, mule &s;peed-well,
is &s;uppo&s;ed to have originated from the officinal one, and
the &s;piked one; and the Sibthorpia Europaea to have for its pa|rents
the golden &s;axifrage and mar&s;h pennywort. Pulteney's
View of Linneus, p. 253.</P>
<P>There is another vegetable fact publi&s;hed by M. Koelruter,
which he calls &startq;a complete metamorpho&s;is of one natural &s;pecies
of plants into another;&endq; which &s;hews, that in &s;eeds as well as in
buds, the embryon proceeds from the male parent, though the
form of the &s;ub&s;equent mature plant is in part dependent on the
$emale. M. Koelruter impregnated a &s;tigma of the nicotiana
ru&s;tica with the farina of the nicotiana paniculata, and obtained
prolific &s;eeds from it. With the plants, which &s;prung from the&s;e
&s;eeds, he repeated the experiment, impregnating their pi&s;tilla with
<PB N="106" REF="112">
the farina of the nicotiana paniculata. As the mule plants, which
he thus produced, were prolific, he continued to impregnate
them for many generations with the farina of the nicotiana pani|culata,
and they became more and more like the male parent,
till he at length obtained &s;ix plants in every re&s;pect perfectly
&s;imilar to the nicotiana paniculata, and in no re&s;pect re&s;embling
their female parent the nicotiana ru&s;tica. Blumenback on Gene|ration.</P>
<P>Mr. Graberg, Mr. Schreber, and Mr. Ram&s;trom, &s;eem of opi|nion,
that the internal &s;tructure or parts of fructification in mule
plants re&s;emble the female parent; but that the habit or external
structure re&s;embles the male parent. See treati&s;es under the
above names in Vol. VI. Amoenit. Academic.</P>
<P>7. Something &s;imilar to this &s;eems to obtain in mixing the
breeds of the &s;ame &s;pecies of animals, and in animal mules, which
may be worth the attention of the grazier. The mule produced
from a hor&s;e and a &s;he a&s;s re&s;embles the hor&s;e externally with his
ears, mane, and tail; but with the nature, or manners of an a&s;s.
But the hinnus, or creature produced from a male a&s;s and a
mare, re&s;embles the father externally in &s;tature, a&s;h-colour, and
the black cro&s;s on his &s;houlders, but with the nature or manners
of a hor&s;e. The breed from Spani&s;h rams and Swedi&s;h ewes re|&s;embled
the Spani&s;h &s;heep in wool, &s;tature, and external form;
but was as hardy as the Swedi&s;h &s;heep; and the contrary oc|curred
in the breeds which were produced from Swedi&s;h rams
and Spani&s;h ewes. The offspring from the male goat of Angora
and the Swedi&s;h female goat had long &s;oft camel's hair; but that
from the male Swedi&s;h goat, and the female one of Angora, had
no improvement of their wool. An Engli&s;h ram without horns,
and a Swedi&s;h horned ewe, produced &s;heep without horns.
Amoen. Acad. Vol. VI. p. 13.</P>
<P>8. From the&s;e circum&s;tances it appears, that not only new varie|ties
may be procured from the &s;eminal offspring of plants;
where tho&s;e from the lateral offspring become di&s;ea&s;ed by age, as
the cankered apple-grafts, and perhaps the curled potatoes, and
barren &s;trawberries; but that more curious or u&s;eful fruits or
flowers may be obtained by &s;hedding the farina of &s;ome valuable
plant on the &s;tigma of another variety of the &s;ame &s;pecies, as of
<PB N="107" REF="113">
two different but equally excellent apple-trees, or tulip-flowers,
hyacinths, anemonies, and geraniums. And thirdly, that mules
may be produced by a mixture of different &s;pecies of plants, and
perhaps of different genera; as of pines and melons; grapes and
goo&s;eberries; oranges and apples; apricots and nectarines; nuts
and acorns; which may be afterwards propagated by the lateral
progeny, if not by the &s;eminal one.</P>
<P>The facility of generating vegetable mules &s;eems forcibly to
have &s;truck the great Linneus; who in the preface to his natural
orders of plants at the end of his Genera Plantarum thinks, that
about &s;ixty vegetables were at fir&s;t created corre&s;ponding with his
natural orders. That a mixture of the&s;e orders among&s;t them|&s;elves
produced the genera; that a mixture of the genera among&s;t
them&s;elves produced the &s;pecies; and that a mixture of the &s;pe|cies
produced the varieties, which he believes to accord with the
general progre&s;s of nature <HI>&startq;from &s;impler things to the more com|pound.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that many of the
pre&s;ent &s;pecies of animals were originally mules produced by a
mixture of animals of different genera; and that all &s;uch mules,
as had perfect organs of reproduction, continued their &s;pecies.
But as the&s;e organs &s;eem to be the chef d'oeuvre of nature, as
above remarked, they often become imperfect in the generation
of mules, and the &s;pecies then becomes extinct; as it could not
be propagated by &s;exual generation, it is po&s;&s;ible, that many new
kinds of mules, which might be u&s;eful for labour, or by their
milk or wool, or for food, might &s;till be produced by the method
of Spallanzani; who diluted the &s;eminal fluid of a dog with much
warm water, and by injecting it fecundated a bitch, and produced
puppies like the dog.</P>
<P>Thus new animal combinations might po&s;&s;ibly be generated
numerous as the fabled mon&s;ters of antiquity; as between the
ram and the female goat; the &s;tag and the cow; the hor&s;e and
the doe; the bull and the mare; boar and bitch; dog and &s;ow.
And &s;econdly, as Spallanzani diluted the &s;eminal fluid of a male
frog with water, and fecundated &s;ome female &s;pawn with it, and
produced perfect tadpoles, there is rea&s;on to conclude, that new
combinations of fi&s;h might thus be generated, and people our
<PB N="108" REF="114">
rivers with aquatic mon&s;ters. And la&s;tly, that it is not impossi|ble,
as &s;ome philo&s;opher has already &s;uppo&s;ed, if Spallanzani
&s;hould continue his experiments, that &s;ome beautiful productions
might be generated between the vegetable and animal kingdoms,
like the ea&s;tern fable of the ro&s;e and nightingale, and which might
be propagated by lateral or paternal though not by &s;exual or &s;e|minal
generation.</P>
<P>The cla&s;&s;ic reader will here be reminded of the metamorpho|&s;es
of Ovid, of gods turned into bulls and &s;wans, men into frogs
and partridges, ladies into trees and flowers, of &s;phinxes, griffins,
dragons, mermaids, centaurs, and minataurs; Pa&s;iphae and her
bull; Leda and her &s;wan; Arethu&s;a and her fi&s;h-god Alpheus,
and conclude that mules in early times were more frequent than
at pre&s;ent, which occa&s;ioned the poets and the prie&s;ts of antiquity
to invent &s;o many fabulous mon&s;ters, and impo&s;e them on the
credulity of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>III. VEGETABLE GENERATION.</HEAD>
<P>1. The intelligent reader is become, I hope, by this time &s;o
much intere&s;ted in the further inve&s;tigation of the circum|&s;tances
attending the lateral and &s;exual generation of vegetables,
that he will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with the continuance of the &s;ub|ject
for a few more pages, &s;o agreeable from its novelty, and &s;o
important from its future application to animal reproduction.</P>
<P>If a &s;cion of a nonpareil apple be ingrafted on a crab-&s;tock,
and a golden pippin be ingrafted on the nonpareil, what happens?
The ca$dex of the bud of the golden pippin con&s;i&s;ts of its proper
ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, arteries, and veins, till it reaches down to the
the nonpareil-&s;tock; and then the continuation of its caudex
downwards con&s;i&s;ts of ve&s;&s;els &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the nonpariel;
when its caudex de&s;cends &s;till lower, it con&s;i&s;ts of ve&s;&s;els &s;imilar
to tho&s;e of the crab-&s;tock.</P>
<P>The truth of this is &s;hewn by two circum&s;tances; fir&s;t, becau&s;e
the lower parts of this compound tree will occa&s;ionally put forth
buds &s;imilar to the original &s;tock. And &s;econdly, becau&s;e in
&s;ome ingrafted trees, where a quick-growing &s;cion has been in|&s;erted
<PB N="109" REF="115">
into a &s;tock of &s;lower growth, as is often &s;een in old cher|ry-trees,
the upper part of the trunk of the tree has become of
almo&s;t double the diameter of the lower part; both which occur|rences
&s;hew, that the lower part of the trunk of the tree continues
to be of the &s;ame kind, though it mu&s;t have been &s;o repeatedly
covered over with new circles of wood, bark and cuticle.</P>
<P>Now as the caudex of each bud, which pa&s;&s;es the whole length
of the trunk of the tree, and forms a communication from the
upper part, or plumula, to the lower part, or radicle, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t
in the&s;e doubly ingrafted trees of three different kinds of cau|dexes,
re&s;embling tho&s;e of the different &s;tocks or &s;cions; we ac|quire
a knowledge of what may be termed a lateral or paternal
mule, in contradi&s;tinction to a &s;exual mule. For as in the&s;e trees
thus combined by ingraftment every bud has the upper parts of
its caudex that of a golden pippin, the middle part of it that of a
nonpareil, of the lower part of it that of a crab; if the&s;e cau|dexes,
which con&s;titute the filaments of the bark, could be &s;epa|rated
entire from the tree with their plumules and radicles, they
would exhibit &s;o many lateral or paternal mules, con&s;i&s;ting of the
connected parts of their three parents; the plumula belonging to
the upper parent, and the radicle to the lower one, and the
triple caudex to them all.</P>
<P>A &s;eparation of the&s;e buds from the parent plant is &s;aid to
have been ob&s;erved by Mr. Blumenback in the conferva fonti|nalis,
a vegetable which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall &s;hort &s;lender threads,
which grow in our fountains, and fix their roots in the mud.
He ob&s;erved by magnifying gla&s;&s;es, that the extremities of the
threads &s;well, and form &s;mall tubera, or heads, which gradual|ly
&s;eparate from the parent threads, attach them&s;elves to the
ground, and become perfect vegetables; the whole progre&s;s of
their formation can be ob&s;erved in forty-eight hours. Ob&s;erva|tions
on plants, by Von U&s;lar, Creech, Edinb.</P>
<P>2. The lateral propagation of the polypus found in our ditches
in July, but more particularly that of the hydra &s;tentorea, is
wonderfully analogous to the above idea of the lateral genera|tion
of vegetables. The hydra &s;tentorea, according to the ac|count
of mon&s;ieur Trembley, multiplies it&s;elf by &s;plitting length-wi&s;e;
and in twenty-four hours the&s;e divi&s;ions, which adhere
<PB N="110" REF="116">
to a common pedicle, re&s;plit, and form four di&s;tinct animals.
The&s;e four in an equal time &s;plit again, and thus double their
number daily, till they acquire a figure &s;omewhat re&s;embling a
no&s;egay. The young animals afterwards &s;eparate from the
parent, attach them&s;elves to aquatic plants, and give ri&s;e to
new colonies.</P>
<P>Another curious animal fact is related by Blumenback in his
treati&s;e on generation, concerning the fre&s;h water polypus. He
cut two of them in half, which were of different colours, and
applying the upper-part of one to the lower part of the other,
by means of a gla&s;s tube, and retaining them thus for &s;ome time
in contact with each other, the two divided extremities united,
and became one animal.</P>
<P>The attentive reader has already anticipated me in applying
the&s;e wonderful modes of lateral animal reproduction and con|junction
to the lateral propagation and ingraftment of vegetables.
The junction of the head-part of one polypus to the tail-part of
another is exactly repre&s;ented by the ingraftment of a &s;cion on
the &s;tock of another tree. The plumula, or apex of each bud,
with the upper part of its caudex, joins to the long caudex of
the &s;tock, which pa&s;&s;ing down the trunk terminates in the ra|dicles
of it. And if this compound vegetable could be &s;eparated
longitudinally from the other long filaments of the bark in its
vicinity, like the fibres of the bark of the mulberry-tree prepared
at Otaheite, or as the bark of hemp and flax are prepared in
this country, as the young ones of the hydra &s;tentorea &s;eparate
from their parents, it might claim the name of a lateral or pa|ternal
mule, as above mentioned.</P>
<P>3. It hence appears, that every new bud of a tree, where two
&s;cions have been in&s;erted over each other on a &s;tock, if it could
be &s;eparated from the plume to the radicle, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of three
different kinds of caudex, and might therefore be called a triple
lateral mule. And that hence it follows, that every part of
this new triple caudex, mu&s;t have been &s;eparated or &s;ecreted
laterally from the adjoining part of the trunk of the tree; and
that it could not be formed, as I formerly believed, from the
roots of the plume of the bud de&s;cending from the upper part
of the caudex of it to the earth. A circum&s;tance of great im|portance
<PB N="111" REF="117">
in the inve&s;tigation of the curious &s;ubject of the lateral
generation of vegetables, and of in&s;ects.</P>
<P>One might hence &s;u&s;pect, that if Blumenback had attended
to the propagation of the polypus, which he had compo&s;ed of
two half polypi, that the young progeny might have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
two colours re&s;embling the compound parent, like the different
caudexes of ingrafted trees; an experiment well worthy repeat|ed
ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>4. Another animal fact ought al&s;o to be here mentioned, that
many in&s;ects, as common earth-worms as well as the polypus,
are &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much life throughout a great part of their
&s;y&s;tem, that they may be cut into two or more pieces without
de&s;troying them, as each piece will acquire a new head, or a
new tail, or both; and the in&s;ect will thus become multiplied.
How exactly this is re&s;embled by the long caudex of the buds
of trees, which po&s;&s;ess &s;uch vegetable life from one extremity
to the other, that when the head or plume is lopped of, it can
produce a new plume; and when the lower part is cut off, it
can produce new radicles; and may be thus wonderfully mul|tiplied.</P>
<P>5. Hence we acquire &s;ome new and important ideas concern|ing
the lateral generation of vegetables, and which may pro|bably
contribute to elucidate their &s;exual generation. The&s;e
are, fir&s;t, that the parts of the long caudex of each new bud
of an ingrafted tree, and con&s;equently of all trees, are &s;eparated
or &s;ecreted from the corre&s;pondent or adjoining parts of the
long caudex of the la&s;t year's bud, which was its parent; and
not that it con&s;i&s;ts of the roots of each new bud &s;hot down from
the plumula or apex of it, as I formerly &s;uppo&s;ed; and that
tho&s;e various molecules, or fibrils, &s;ecreted from the caudex of
the la&s;t year's buds, adjoin and grow together beneath the cu|ticle
of the trunk of the tree, the upper ones forming the plumula
of the new bud, which is its leaf or lungs, to acquire oxygen
from the atmo&s;phere; and the lower ones forming the radicles
of it, which are ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els to acquire nutriment from the
earth.</P>
<P>Secondly, that every part of the caudex of an ingrafted tree,
and con&s;equently of all trees, can generate or produce a new
<PB N="112" REF="118">
bud, when the upper part of it is &s;trangulated with a wire or
cut off, or otherwi&s;e when it is &s;upplied more abundantly with
nutriment, ventilation, and light. And that each of the&s;e new
buds thus produced re&s;embles that part of the &s;tock in compound
trees, where it ari&s;es. Thus in the triple tree above mentioned
a bud from the upper part of the long caudexes, which form
the filaments of the bark, would become a golden pippin branch;
a bud from the middle part of them would become a nonpareil
branch; and a bud from the lower part a crab branch.</P>
<P>Thirdly, another wonderful property of this lateral mule
progeny of trees compounded by ingraftment con&s;i&s;ts in this,
that the new mule may con&s;i&s;t of parts from three, or
four, or many parents, when &s;o many different &s;cions are ingrafted on
each other; whence a que&s;tion may ari&s;e, whether a mixture
of two kinds of anther-du&s;t previous to its application to the
&s;tigma of flowers might not produce a threefold mule, partaking
of the likene&s;s of both the males?</P>
<P>6. On this nice &s;ubject of reproduction &s;o far removed from
common apprehen&s;ion the patient reader will excu&s;e a more pro|lix
inve&s;tigation. The attraction of all matter to the centres of
the planets, or of the &s;un, is termed gravitation; that of par|ticular
bodies to each others it generally called chemical affinity;
to which the attractions belonging to electricity and magneti&s;m
appear to be allied.</P>
<P>In the&s;e latter kinds of attraction two circum&s;tances &s;eem to
be required; fir&s;t, the power to attract po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one of the
bodies, and &s;econdly, the aptitude to be attracted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
the other. Thus when a magnet attracts iron, it may be &s;aid
to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pecific tendency to unite with the iron; and the
iron may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pecific aptitude to be united with
the magnet. The former appears to re&s;ide in the magnet, be|cau&s;e
it can be deprived of its attractive power, which can al&s;o
be re&s;tored to it; and the iron appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pecific ap|titude
to be united with the magnet, becau&s;e no other metal will
approach it. In the &s;ame manner a rubbed &s;tick of &s;ealing-wax
may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pecific tendency to unite with a light
&s;traw, but not with a gla&s;s bead. Here the &s;traw &s;eems to
po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pecific aptitude to unite with the rubbed &s;ealing-wax,
<PB N="113" REF="119">
becau&s;e many other bodies refu&s;e to do &s;o, as gla&s;s, &s;ilk, air;
and la&s;tly, the &s;pecific attraction of the rubbed &s;ealing-wax can
be withdrawn or re&s;tored; to which may be added, that &s;ome
chemical combinations may ari&s;e from the &s;ingle attraction of
one body, and the aptitude to be attracted of another; or they
may be owing to reciprocal attractions of the two bodies, as in
what is termed by the chemi&s;ts double affinity, which is known
to be &s;o powerful as to &s;eparate tho&s;e bodies, which are held
together by the &s;ingle attraction probably of one of them to
the other, which other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es only an aptitude to be at|tracted
by the former.</P>
<P>7. The above account of the tendencies to union by unorga|nized
or inanimate matter is not given as a philo&s;ophical ana|logy,
but to facilitate our conception of the adjunctions or con|cretions
ob&s;ervable in organized or animated bodies, which con|&s;titute
their formation, their nutrition, and their growth. The&s;e
may be divided into two kinds; fir&s;t the junction or union of
animated bodies with inanimate matter, as when fruit or fle&s;h
is &s;wallowed into the &s;tomach, and becomes ab&s;orbed by the
lacteals; and the &s;econd, where living particles coale&s;ce or
concrete together, as in the formation, nutrition, or conjunc|tion
of the parts of living animals.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the former, the animal parts, as the no&s;trils
and palate, po&s;&s;e&s;s an appetency, when &s;timulated by the &s;cent
and flavour of agreeable food, to unite them&s;elves with it; and
the inanimate material po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an aptitude to be thus united
with the animal organ. The &s;ame occurs when the food is
&s;wallowed into the &s;tomach; the mouths of the lacteal ve&s;&s;els
being agreeably &s;timulated po&s;&s;e&s;s an appetency to ab&s;orb the
particles of the dige&s;ting ma&s;s, which is in a &s;ituation of under|going
chemical changes, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es at &s;ome period of them
an aptitude to be united with the mouths of the ab&s;orbent lac|teals.</P>
<P>But when the&s;e ab&s;orbed particles of inanimate matter have
been circulated in the blood, they &s;eem gradually to obtain a
kind of vitality; whence Mr. John Hunter, and I believe &s;ome
ancient philo&s;ophers, and the divine Mo&s;es, a&s;&s;erted, that the
blood is alive; that is, that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome degree of organi|zation,
<PB N="114" REF="120">
or other properties different from tho&s;e of inanimate
matter, which are not producible by any chemical proce&s;s, and
which cea&s;e to exi&s;t along with the life of the animal. Hence
for the purpo&s;e of nutrition there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that two
circum&s;tances are nece&s;&s;ary, both dependent upon life, and con|&s;equent
activity; the&s;e are fir&s;t an appetency of the fibrils of
the fixed organization, which wants nutrition; and &s;econdly,
a propen&s;ity of the fluid molecules exi&s;ting in the blood,
or &s;ecreted from it, to unite with the organ now &s;timulated into
action. So that nutrition may be &s;aid to be affected by the
embrace or cohe&s;ion of the fibrils, which po&s;&s;e&s;s nutritive appe|tencies
with the molecules, which po&s;&s;e&s;s nutritive propen&s;i|ties.</P>
<P>8. If the philo&s;opher, who thinks on this &s;ubject, &s;hould not
be inclined to believe that the whole of the blood is alive; he
can not ea&s;ily deny life to that part of it which is &s;ecreted by
the organs of generation, and conveys vitality to the new em|bryon,
which it produces. Hence though in the pro&s;ess of
nutrition the activity of two kinds of fibrils or molecules may be
&s;u&s;pected, yet in the proce&s;s of the generation of a new vegeta|ble
or animal, there &s;eems great rea&s;on to believe, that both the
combining and combined particles are endued with vitality;
that is, with &s;ome degree of organization or other properties not
exi&s;ting in inanimate matter, which we beg leave to denominate
fibrils with formative appetencies, and molecules with formative
propen&s;ities, as the former may &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater degree
of organization than the latter.</P>
<P>And thus it appears, that though nutrition may be conceived
to be produced by the animated fibrils of an organized part being
&s;timulated into action by inanimate molecules, which they then
embrace, and may thus be popularly compared to the &s;imple at|tractions
of chemi&s;try; yet that in the production of a new
embryon, whether vegetable or animal, both the fibrils with
formative appetencies, and the molecules with formative propen|&s;ities,
reciprocally &s;timulate and embrace each other, and in|&s;tantly
coale&s;ce, and may thus popularly be compared to the
double affinities of chemi&s;try. But there are animal facts,
which re&s;emble both the&s;e, and are thence more philo&s;ophi|cally
<PB N="115" REF="121">
analogous to them; and the&s;e are the two great &s;upports of animated nature, the pa&s;&s;ions of hunger and of love. In the
former the appetency re&s;ides only in the &s;tomach, or perhaps in
the cardia ventriculi, but the object con&s;i&s;ts of inanimate matter;
in the latter reciprocal appetencies and propen&s;ities exi&s;t in the
male and female, which mutually excite them to embrace each
other. Two other animal facts are equally analogous; the thir&s;t, which re&s;ides at the upper end of the e&s;ophagus, and
though it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es appetency it&s;elf, its object is inanimate mat|ter;
but in lacte&s;cent females, when they give &s;uck to their young, there exi&s;ts a reciprocal appetency in the mother to part
with her milk, and in the young offspring to receive it.</P>
<P>This then finally I conceive to be the manner of the produc|tion
of the lateral progeny of vegetables. The long caudex of an exi&s;ting bud of
a tree, which con&s;titutes a &s;ingle filament of
the pre&s;ent bark, is furni&s;hed with glands numerous as the per|&s;pirative
or mucous glands of animal bodies; and that the&s;e are
of two kinds, the one &s;ecreting from the vegetable blood the
fibrils with formative appetencies, corre&s;pondent to the ma&s;cu|line
&s;ecretion of animals; and the other &s;ecreting from the vege|table
blood the molecules with formative propen&s;ities, corre|&s;pondent
to the feminine &s;ecretion of animals; and then that
both the&s;e kinds of formative particles are depo&s;ited beneath the
cuticle of the bark along the whole cour&s;e of it, and nearly at the &s;ame time by the &s;ympathy of the &s;ecreting organs, and in&s;tantly embrace and coale&s;ce, forming a new caudex along the
&s;ide of its parent with vegetable life, and with the additional powers of nutrition, and of growth.</P>
<P>9. This then is the great &s;ecret of nature; more living par|ticles
are produced by the powers of vitality in the fabrication
of the vegetable blood, than are nece&s;&s;ary for nutrition or re|&s;toration
of decompo&s;ing organs. These are &s;ecreted, and de|truded
externally, and produce by their combination a new vital
organization beneath the cuticles of trees over the old one.
The&s;e new combinations of vital fibrils and molecules acquire
new appetencies, or fabricate molecules with new propen&s;ities,
and thus po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of forming the leaf or lungs at one
extremity of the new caudex; and the radicles, or ab&s;orbent
<PB N="116" REF="122">
ve&s;&s;els at the other end; and &s;ome of them, as in the central
buds which terminate the branches, finally form the &s;exual organs of reproduction, which con&s;titute the flower.</P>
<P>That new organizations of the growing &s;y&s;tem acquire new appetencies appears from the production of the pa&s;&s;ion for gene|ration,
as &s;oon as the adapted organs are complete; and from
the de&s;ire of lacte&s;cent females to &s;uckle their offspring, and al&s;o
from the variation of the palate, or de&s;ire for particular kinds
of food, as we advance in life, as from milk to fle&s;h. Thus as
a popular allu&s;ion, and not as a philo&s;ophical analogy, we may
again be allowed to apply to the combinations of chemi&s;try;
where two different kinds of particles unite, as acids and alka|lies,
a third &s;omething is produced, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es attractions
di&s;&s;imilar to tho&s;e of either of them; and that new organizations
form new molecules appears from the &s;ecretions of the &s;eminal
and uterine glands, when they have acquired their maturity;
and from the brea&s;ts of lacte&s;cent females.</P>
<P>10. In the lateral propagation of vegetable buds as the &s;uper|fluous
fibrils or molecules, which were fabricated in the blood,
or detached from living organs, and po&s;&s;e&s;s nutritive or forma|tive
appetencies and propen&s;ities, and which were more abund|ant
than were required for the nutrition of the parent vegetable
bud, when it had obtained its full growth, were &s;ecreted by in|numerable
glands on the various parts of its &s;urface beneath the
general cuticle of the tree, and there embracing and coale&s;cing,
form a new embryon caudex, which gradually produces a new
plumula and radicles. And as the different parts of the new
caudex of a compound tree re&s;emble the parts of the parent cau|dex,
to which it adheres, it was &s;hewn, beyond all doubt, that
different fibrils or molecules were detached from different parts
of the parent caudex to form the filial one.</P>
<P>So in the &s;exual propagation of vegetables the &s;uperfluous liv|ing
fibrils, or molecules, floating in the blood, appear to be
&s;ecreted from it by two kinds of glands only; tho&s;e which con|&s;titute
the anthers, and tho&s;e which con&s;titute the pericarp of
flowers. By the former I &s;uppo&s;e the fibrils, with formative
appetencies and with nutritive appetencies, to be &s;ecreted; and
by the latter the molecules, with formative and with nutritive
<PB N="117" REF="123">
propen&s;ities. Afterwards that the&s;e fibrils with formative and
nutritive appetencies, become mixed in the pericarp or uterus
of the flower, with the corre&s;pondent molecules with formative and nutritive propen&s;ities; and that a new embryon is in&s;tantly
produced by their reciprocal embrace and coale&s;cence. And
that parts of this new organization afterwards acquire new ap|petencies,
and form molecules with new propen&s;ities, and thus
gradually produce other parts of the growing &s;eed, which do not
at fir&s;t appear, as the plumula, radicles, cuticle, and the glands
of reproduction in the pericarp and anthers, which corre&s;pond
in the animal fetus to the lungs, inte&s;tines, cuticle, and the
organs, which di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;exes.</P>
<P>11. From this new doctrine of a threefold vegetable mule by
lateral propagation, as the new bud on the &s;ummit of a tree,
which has had two &s;cions ingrafted on it one above another, in
which it is inconte&s;tibly &s;hewn, that different fibrils, or mole+cules,
are detached from different parts of the parent cau|dex
to form the filial one, which adheres to it; and that it then
acquires the power of producing new radicles, or a new plu|mula;
we may &s;afely conclude, as it is deducible from the
&s;tronge&s;t analogy, that in the production of &s;exual mules, whe|ther
vegetable or animal, &s;ome parts of the new embryon were
produced by, or detached from, &s;imilar parts of the parent,
which they re&s;emble. And that as the&s;e fibrils, or molecules,
floated in the circulating blood of their parents, they were col|lected
&s;eparately by appropriated glands of the male or female;
and that finally, on their mixture in the matrix the new em|bryon
was immediately generated, re&s;embling in &s;ome parts the
form of the father, and in other parts the form of the mother,
according to the quantity or activity of the fibrils or molecules
at the time of their conjunction.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, that various parts of the new organizations after|wards
acquired new appetencies, and formed molecules with
new propen&s;ities, and thus gradually produced other parts of the
growing fetus, as the &s;kin, nails, hair, and the organs which di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;exes.</P>
<P>If the molecules &s;ecreted by the female organ into the pericarp
of flowers, or into the ovary of animals, were &s;uppo&s;ed to con|&s;i&s;t
<PB N="118" REF="124">
of only unorganized or inanimate particles; and the fibrils
&s;ecreted by the male organ only to po&s;&s;e&s;s formative appetencies
to &s;elect and combine with them; the new embryon mu&s;t pro|bably
hare always re&s;embled the father, and no mules could
have had exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But by the theory above delivered it appears, that the new
offspring, both in vegetable and animal reproduction, whether
it be a mule or not, mu&s;t &s;ometimes more re&s;emble the male
parent, and &s;ometimes the female one, and &s;ometimes appear to
be a combination of them both, as the epigram of Martial:
<Q><L>Dum dubitat natura gravis puerum faceretne puellam.</L>
<L>Factus es, O pulcher, pene puella, puer.</L></Q></P>
<P>12. The certain proof above given, that &s;ome parts of the
triple caudex of the new bud of a tree, which has been com|pounded
by ingraftment, are formed from &s;imilar parts of the
triple caudex of the parent bud, carries us one &s;tep further back
into the my&s;terious proce&s;s of reproduction, and &s;omewhat coun|tenances
the ingenious conjectures of mon&s;ieur Buffon. And
the analogy here ob&s;erved, that as in chemical union there mu&s;t
be &s;ome particles of inanimate matter with attractions, and others
with aptitudes to be attracted; &s;o in the conjunctions of animat|ed
particles in the nutrition or formation of organized beings,
there mu&s;t exi&s;t fibrils or molecules with formative or nutritive
appetencies, and others with formative or nutritive aptitudes or
propen&s;ities, one of which may be &s;ecreted by the male, and the
other by the female parent, may facilitate our rea&s;oning upon
this dark &s;ubject, which will be re&s;umed and enlarged upon in
the next edition of Zoonomia, in the &s;ection on generation.</P>

<Q>1. Vegetable mu&s;cles evinced by their clo&s;ing their corols, and calyxes,
and moving their leaves in con&s;equence of &s;timulus. Hence al&s;o
vegetable nerves both of &s;en&s;e and motion. When one part of a
leaf of mimo&s;a is touched the whole leaf falls. Hence al&s;o a ve|getable
brain or common &s;en&s;orium. 2. Their irritability &s;hewn
by the ab&s;orption, and circulation of their fluids. By electric
&s;hocks. By the a&s;cent of &s;ap-juice. 3. Their &s;ensibility &s;hewn
by the collaps of mimo&s;a. By clo&s;ing their petals from defect of
&s;timulus, as in darkne&s;s and cold. By the males and females
bending to each other. 4. Their volition &s;hewn from hedy&s;arum
gyrans. From polymorpha marchantia. From tendrils of vines.
From their &s;leep. 5. Their a&s;&s;ociations of motion &s;hewn by their

con&s;equently po&s;&s;e&s;s a brain or common &s;en&s;orium. 7. They po&s;&s;e&s;s
a &s;en&s;e of touch and a common &s;en&s;orium. 8. How do the anthers
and &s;tigmas find each other? by a &s;en&s;e of &s;mell. Adultery of
collin&s;onia. 9. From their ab&s;orptions, &s;ecretions, &s;en&s;es, love and
&s;leep, they mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a brain. Does this re&s;ide in the pith of
each individual bud?</Q>
<P>1. THE various motions of peculiar parts of vegetables evince
the exi&s;tence of mu&s;cles and nerves in tho&s;e parts, &s;uch as the
clo&s;ing of their petals, and calyxes, at the approach of night, or
in cold or wet weather; though the fibres and nerves, which
con&s;titute the&s;e mu&s;cles, are too fine for anatomical demon|&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="126">
Some vegetables fold the older leaves over the new buds at the extremity of their &s;talks during the night, as al&s;ine, chick-weed;
others, as the mimo&s;a, &s;en&s;itive plant, fold the upper or
poli&s;hed &s;ides of their leaves together during their &s;leep. The
hedy&s;arum gyrans whirls its leaves in various directions, when
the air is &s;till, by an apparently voluntary effort, probably for the
purpo&s;e of re&s;piration. The dionoea mu&s;cipula, Venus's fly-trap,
clo&s;es its leaves from the &s;timulus of in&s;ects, which crawl upon
them, and pierces them with its prickles. And the apocynum
andro&s;emifolium contracts its petals or nectaries round the pro|bo&s;cis
of the flies, which &s;timulate it, and holds them till they
die, or till the &s;leep of the plant relea&s;es them by the relaxation
of its mu&s;cular action.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances it appears, that there are not only
mu&s;cles about the moving foot-&s;talks or claws of the leaves and
petals above mentioned; but that the&s;e mu&s;cles mu&s;t be endued
with nerves of &s;en&s;e as well as of motion. Now, as when one part
of a leaf of mimo&s;a is touched, the whole leaf falls, it follows,
that there mu&s;t be a common &s;en&s;orium, or brain, where the
nerves communicate, belonging to this one leaf-bud. To evince
this further another leaf-let was &s;lit with &s;harp &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and &s;ome
&s;econds of time elap&s;ed, before the plant &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of the
injury; and then the whole plant collap&s;ed as far as the principal
&s;tem. Afterwards a &s;mall drop of oil of vitriol was put on
the
bud in the bo&s;om of a leaf of another &s;en&s;itive plant; and, after
about half a minute, when the brain of this bud could be &s;up|po&s;ed
to be de&s;troyed, the whole leaf fell, and ro&s;e no more.
If the individual buds of plants po&s;&s;e&s;s mu&s;cles and nerves with a
brain, or common &s;en&s;orium; the following que&s;tions con&s;e|quently
occur, and &s;hould be an&s;wered in the affirmative. Have
vegetable buds irritability? have they &s;en&s;ation? have they voli|tion?
Have they a&s;&s;ociations of motions? I am per&s;uaded they
po&s;&s;e&s;s them all, though in a much inferior degree even than the
cold blooded animals.</P>
<P>2. The irritability of vegetable fibres is demon&s;trated by the
ab&s;orption and circulation of their fluids in their roots, leaves, and
petals; which can not be explained by any mechanic law, and
exactly corre&s;ponds with the ab&s;orption of the aliment, and the
circulation of the blood in animals; which Physiologi&s;ts have
<PB N="121" REF="127">
demon&s;trated to depend on the mu&s;cular motions of the ve&s;&s;els
them&s;elves, which po&s;&s;e&s;s irritability, and are excited into action
by the &s;timulus of the fluids, which they acquire or contain.</P>
<P>The irritability of vegetable ve&s;&s;els is &s;hewn by a curious ex|periment
of Von U&s;lar, who pa&s;&s;ed &s;trong electric &s;hocks through
a plant of euphorbia, &s;o as to de&s;troy the life of the plant; and
he then ob&s;erved on cutting off a branch, that it did not bleed;
though a &s;imilar branch cut off before the death of the plant ef|fu&s;ed
much milky juice; whence he ju&s;tly concludes, that the
electric percu&s;&s;ion had de&s;troyed the irritability of the plant.</P>
<P>Mr. Cavallo a&s;&s;erts in his Treati&s;e on Electricity, that he
found by repeated experiments, that the plant bal&s;am (impatiens)
was de&s;troyed by le&s;s quantities of electricity than any other ve|getables,
which he &s;ubjected to it; and that on examining the
plant afterwards no injury on the external or internal parts of it
could be di&s;covered; whence it may be concluded that the irri|tability
&s;imply, and not the organization of the plant, was de|&s;troyed
by the unnatural quantity of &s;timulus. He adds, that
not only &s;hocks from &s;o &s;mall a coated &s;urface as &s;ix or eight
&s;quare inches, but even &s;trong &s;parks from a large conductor
de&s;troyed the&s;e plants, which &s;ometimes recovered in a day or
two, but not frequently. See Sect. XIII. 3. and Sect. XIV. 2.
3. of this work.</P>
<P>The a&s;cent of the &s;ap-juice during the vernal months in the
experiments both of Hales and Walker, being retarded or quite
&s;topped during the cold parts of the day, and in the night; and
on the north &s;ide of the tree in cool days, when it continued to
flow on the &s;outh &s;ide, can only be a&s;cribed to the irritability of
the vegetable ve&s;&s;els being decrea&s;ed by the deficient &s;timulus of
heat. See this &s;ubject further treated of in Sect. XIV. 1. 10. of
this work.</P>
<P>3. The &s;en&s;ibility of fibres is di&s;tingui&s;hed from their irritability
by the pain or plea&s;ure, which precedes or attends any animal ac|tion;
and therefore &s;uppo&s;es the exi&s;tence of a common &s;en&s;o|rium;
now when one divi&s;ion of a leaf of mimo&s;a is injured by a
wound or touch, in a &s;hort time the whole leaf clo&s;es, which is
owing to the actions of the di&s;tant mu&s;cles about the foot&s;talks
of the &s;ubdivi&s;ions of the leaf. Does not this prove, that there
<PB N="122" REF="128">
is a brain or common &s;en&s;orium, where the nerves communicate in &s;ome part of this bud or leaf, as the injury of one di&s;tant part
of it thus affects the whole? or in other words, that the di&s;agree|able
&s;en&s;ation is propagated from a part to the whole, and cau&s;es
the actions of &s;ome di&s;tant mu&s;cles, in the &s;ame manner as I
draw away my hand when my finger is hurt?</P>
<P>There are mu&s;cles placed about the foot-&s;talks of the leaves or
leaflets of many plants, for the purpo&s;e of clo&s;ing their upper
&s;urfaces together, or of bending them down &s;o as to &s;hoot off
the &s;howers or dew-drops, as in &s;en&s;itive plant, mimo&s;a; kidney-bean,
pha&s;eolus; and many trees. The claws of the petals, or
of the divi&s;ions of the calyx of many flowers, are furni&s;hed in
a &s;imilar manner with mu&s;cles, which are exerted to open or clo&s;e
the corol and calyx of the flower, as in tragopogon, anemone.
This action of opening and clo&s;ing the leaves or flowers do
not appear to be produced &s;imply by irritation on the mu&s;cles
them&s;elves, but by the connexion of those muscles with a &s;en|&s;itive
&s;en&s;orium, or brain, exi&s;ting in each individual bud or
flower, 1&s;t. Becau&s;e many flowers clo&s;e from defect of &s;timulus,
not by the exce&s;s of it, as by darkne&s;s, which is the ab&s;ence of
the &s;timulus of light; or by cold, which is the ab&s;ence of the
&s;timulus of heat. Now the defect of heat, like the ab&s;ence of
food, or of drink, affects our &s;en&s;es with pain, which had been
previou&s;ly accu&s;tomed to a greater quantity of them, and a cu|taneous
&s;hivering may be excited in con&s;equence of the pain; but
a mu&s;cle cannot be &s;aid to be &s;timulated into action by a defect of
&s;timulus though &s;ome modern writers on medicine have called
cold a &s;timulus to animal fibres, which it always renders torpid or
inactive; a theory derived from Galen, and which mu&s;t have
originated in his total ignorance of chemi&s;try and natural philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>In &s;ome flowers the males bend into contact with the females,
as in ci&s;tus, kalmia, fritillaria per&s;ica, lithrum &s;alicaria; in others
the female bends to the males, as in collin&s;onia, glorio&s;a,
geni&s;ta,
epilobium; which &s;hews a &s;en&s;ibility to the pa&s;&s;ion of reproduc|tion.
In <HI>irritation</HI> the &s;timulated mu&s;cles only are brought into
action, without being perceived by the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem;
but in <HI>&s;en&s;ation</HI> the whole &s;y&s;tem is affected by means of the brain
<PB N="123" REF="129">
or common &s;en&s;orium, and thence very di&s;tant mu&s;cles are brought
into action to acquire an agreeable object, or to repel or with|draw
from a di&s;agreeable one. See Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect.
XIII. 2.</P>
<P>4. That plants po&s;&s;e&s;s in &s;ome degree the power of volition
would appear fir&s;t from the hedy&s;arum gyrans, which moves its
leaves in circular directions when the air is too &s;till. Secondly,
from the marchantia polymorpha, in which &s;ome yellow wool
advances from the flower bearing anthers, while it drops its du&s;t
like atoms. Murray's Sy&s;tem of Vegetables. Thirdly, from
the tendrils of vines, and the &s;tems of other climbing vegetables,
which continue to move round, till they find &s;omething to ad|here
to, or till they have rolled them&s;elves up in a &s;piral line like
a cork &s;crew. And la&s;tly, from the efforts of almo&s;t all plants
to turn the upper &s;urface of their leaves, or their flowers, to the light.</P>
<P>But there is an indubitable proof of plants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome de|gree
of voluntarity, and that is deduced from their &s;leep. In
animal bodies &s;leep con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or temporary abolition
of voluntary power; the organs of sense being at the &s;ame time
clo&s;ed, or by &s;ome other means rendered unfit for the perception
of external bodies. Now the &s;leep of plants is proved by the
hanging down or clo&s;ing of the leaves of many plants, and of
&s;hutting the petals and calyxes of many flowers in the dark, and
their again opening or expanding them in the light, or at certain
hours of the day.</P>
<P>5. In re&s;pect to vegetables acquiring a&s;&s;ociations of motion, or
habits of action, the former is &s;een in the ab&s;orptions and circula|tions
of their fluids, and in the various movements above de|&s;cribed;
which whirl their leaves or tendrils, and clo&s;e or open
their corols and calyxes, which could not be performed without
the &s;ynchronous and a&s;&s;ociated actions of many mu&s;cles; as in
the ab&s;orptions and circulations of animal bodies, and the move|ments
of their limbs.</P>
<P>Other acquired habits of vegetable actions appear from the
grains and roots brought from more southern latitudes, which
germinate here sooner than tho&s;e which are brought from more
northern ones, owing to their acquired habits. Fordyce on

Agriculture. And from the apple trees &s;ent from hence to
New York, which blo&s;&s;omed for a few years too early for the
climate, and bore no fruit; but afterwards learnt to accommodate
themselves to their new &s;ituation. Travels in New York by
Profe&s;&s;or Kalm.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ions of the leaves of the &s;en&s;itive plant have been
accu&s;tomed to contract at the &s;ame time from the ab&s;ence of
light; hence if by any other circum&s;tance, as a &s;light &s;troke or
injury, one divi&s;ion is irritated into contraction; the neighbour|ing
ones contract al&s;o, from their motions being a&s;&s;ociated with
tho&s;e of the irritated part. So the various &s;tamina of the bar|berry
have been accu&s;tomed to contract together in the evening;
and thence, if you &s;timulate one of them with a pin, according
to the experiment of Dr. Smith, they all contract from their acquired a&s;&s;ociations.</P>
<P>6. This leads us to a curious inquiry whether vegetables po&s;|&s;e&s;s
any organs of &s;en&s;e? Certain it is, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;en&s;e of
heat and cold, another of moi&s;ture and dryne&s;s, and another
of light and darkne&s;s; for they clo&s;e their petals occa&s;ionally
from the pre&s;ence of cold, moi&s;ture, or darkness. And it has
been already &s;hewn, that the&s;e actions cannot be performed &s;im|ply
from irritation, becau&s;e cold and darkne&s;s are defective quan|tities
of our u&s;ual &s;timuli; and that on that account &s;en&s;ation or
volition are employed; and in con&s;equence a &s;en&s;orium or union
of the nerves mu&s;t exi&s;t. So when we go into the light, we
contract the iris, not from any &s;timulus of the light on the fine
mu&s;cles of the iris, but from its motions being a&s;&s;ociated with the
&s;en&s;ation of too much light on the retina, which could not take
place without a &s;en&s;orium or center of union of the nerves of the
iris with tho&s;e of vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>7. Be&s;ides the&s;e organs of &s;en&s;e, which di&s;tingui&s;h cold, moi&s;|ture,
and darkne&s;s, the leaves of mimo&s;a, and of dionaea, and
of dro&s;era, and the &s;tamens of many flowers, as of the barberry,
and of the numerous cla&s;s of &s;yngene&s;ia, are &s;en&s;ible to mechanic
impact; that is, they po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;en&s;e of touch; and as many of
their di&s;tant mu&s;cles are in con&s;equence excited into action,
this al&s;o evinces, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s a common &s;en&s;orium, by
which this &s;en&s;ation is communicated to the whole, and volition
occa&s;ionally exerted.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="131">
8. La&s;tly, in many flowers the anthers when mature approach
the &s;tigma, in others the female organ approaches to the male. I
a&s;k, by what means are the anthers in many flowers, and &s;tigmas
in other flowers, directed to find their paramours? Is this cu|rious
kind of &s;torge produced by mechanic attraction, or by the
&s;en&s;ation of love? The latter opinion is &s;upported by the
&s;tronge&s;t analogy, becau&s;e a reproduction of the &s;pecies is the con|&s;equence;
and then another organ of &s;en&s;e mu&s;t be wanted to di|rect
the&s;e vegetable amourettes to find each other; one probably
analogous to our &s;en&s;e of &s;mell which in the animal world di|rects
the new-born infant to its &s;ource of nouri&s;hment; and in
&s;ome animals directs the male to the female; and they may
thus po&s;&s;e&s;s a faculty of perceiving as well as of producing
odours.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t curious example of the exi&s;tence of &s;ome kind of
&s;en&s;e which may direct the pi&s;tils, or female parts of the flowers
of collin&s;onia, which way to bend for the purpo&s;e of finding the
mature males is related in Botanic Garden, Vol. I. Canto IV.
l. 460, where &s;ome of the pi&s;tils mi&s;take the males, or &s;tamens,
of the neighbouring flowers for their own hu&s;bands; and bend|ing
into contact with them become guilty of adultery. See Sect.
VII. 2. 2. of this work.</P>
<P>9. Thus, be&s;ides a kind of ta&s;te or appetency at the extremi|ties
of their roots, &s;imilar to that of the extremities of our lac|teal
ve&s;&s;els, for the purpo&s;e of &s;electing their proper food; and
be&s;ides different kinds of irritability or appetency re&s;iding in the
various glands, which &s;eparate honey, wax, re&s;in, and other
juices from their blood; vegetable life &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s an organ
of &s;en&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h the variations of heat, another to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the varying degrees of moi&s;ture, another of light, another
of touch, and probably another analogous to our &s;en&s;e of &s;mell.
To the&s;e mu&s;t be added the indubitable evidence of their pa&s;&s;ion
of love, and of their nece&s;&s;ity to &s;leep; and I think we may truly
conclude, that they are furni&s;hed with a brain or common &s;en&s;o|rium
belonging to each bud.</P>
<P>But whether this brain, or common &s;en&s;orium, re&s;ides in the
medulla, or pith, which occupies the central parts of every bud
and leaf, like the &s;pinal marrow of animals, has not yet been
<PB N="126" REF="132">
certainly determined. By this medulla is meant only the pith of
each individual bud, not that which is &s;een in the center of a
tree, which like the wood which &s;urrounds it, has long cea&s;ed to
have vegetable life.</P>
<P>The pith, or medulla of each bud, is &s;uppo&s;ed by its ela&s;ticity
to pu&s;h out the central part of the bud; as the ve&s;icular produc|tions
on the in&s;ide of young quills are &s;uppo&s;ed to pu&s;h forwards
their early growth, and in &s;ome birds are &s;aid by Mr. Hunter to
receive air from the lungs. It is more probable that this pith, or
medulla oblongata of plants, &s;upplies the &s;pirit of vegetation,
&s;ince it exi&s;ts in all buds in their mo&s;t early &s;tate, and does not
communicate from one bud to another, and thus di&s;tingui&s;h them
from each other, and evinces their individuality. See Sect. I.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE GROWTH OF SEEDS, BUDS, AND BULBS.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>I. 1. SEEDS</HI> re&s;emble eggs. 2. The embryon is of different ma|turity.
The leaves vi&s;ible in &s;ome &s;eeds. 3. Why the plumula
a&s;cends and the root de&s;cends. Is nouri&s;hed by the &s;eed-lobes, by
the fruit. Becomes a dwarf if deprived of them. Melons and
cucumbers are too luxuriant. Turnep-&s;eed &s;hould be new. 4.
Seeds have hard &s;hells, have acrid rinds with bitter or narcotic
juices, but pure &s;tarch may be procured from them. 5. Umbili|cal
ve&s;&s;els, and roots of &s;eets. Annual, biennial, and perennial
plants. Re&s;ervoirs of nutriment in their roots. All plants are
biennials. Bulbs and buds &s;ucceed each other many times before
they flower. 6. Wheat. Stems and roots round the fir&s;t joint.
Has no nectary. Is greatly increa&s;ed by tran&s;planting. <HI>II. 1.
BUDS</HI> are viviparous progeny. Protected by &s;cales and varni&s;h. Grow by piping with more heat and moi&s;ture as they exhale le&s;s.
Are individual, annual, or biennial plants. 2. Buds of herbs.
Evergreens have no bleeding &s;eason. 3. Buds of deciduous trees
are in different &s;tates of maturity, as in hepatica, daphne, o&s;munda.
Some buds are invi&s;ible. 4. Importance of the pith like the &s;pi|nal
marrow; it lines hollow &s;talks. 5. Re&s;ervoir of nutriment
for buds. Their umbilical ve&s;&s;els. 6. A bud contains many
embryons. The fir&s;t leaf-buds often de&s;troyed by in&s;ects. The
flower-buds only injured by them. 7. Vigorous branches pro|duce
<PB N="128" REF="134">
leaf-buds, weak ones flower-buds. Why &s;eedling apples
are long before they bear. Why pears bear only at their extre|mities.
8. New buds may be made either leaf-buds by lopping a
part of the branch, or flower-buds by bending the branch down,
or cutting a ring in the bark, or &s;trangulating it with a wire.
Debarked oaks pullulate. Sap-juice in the alburnum. 9. A
pau&s;e in vegetation about mid&s;ummer. Trees then &s;ecrete nutri|ment
in their roots and &s;ap-wood for the new buds. Are then
be&s;t tran&s;planted without lopping their branches. 10. Caudexes
of the buds from the bark, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els ino&s;culate. Heart-wood
dies. Sap-wood acts as umbilical ve&s;&s;els, and afterwards as
capillary tubes, or as capillary &s;yphons. 11. Flower-buds pe|ri&s;h
without increa&s;ing the bark by new caudexes. Are conver|tible
into leaf-buds. Vegetable mon&s;ters. 12. Central part
of an adult bud. <HI>III. 1. BULBS.</HI> Leaf-bulbs precede flower-bulbs
in the tulip as leaf-buds in apple-trees, at joints in the &s;talk
of wheat. Solitary generation of in&s;ects. 2. Bulbs of onions.
Orchis. Tulip. Hyacinth. Ranunculus. Iris. 3. Roots
of potatoes. Wires of &s;trawberries. Seeds of orchis. Flowers
of potatoes. 4. Stem-bulbs on magical onions are &s;imilar to root-bulbs.
5. Root-grafting. Root-inoculation. Root-propagation.
Suckers of trees. Root-buds of herbaceous plants. Internal
parts of which decay. 6. Tuberous roots of turnep and carrot
are re&s;ervoirs of nutriment for the &s;ucceeding flower-&s;tem. No
flower-bud is ever produced from a &s;eed without previous leaf-buds.
Why &s;eedling apple-trees are ten or twelve years before
they bear fruit. Magazines of aliment in almo&s;t all roots. 7.
U&s;e of the hor&s;e-hoe to accumulate earth round the wheat-plants.
Wheat dropped on the &s;oil &s;hoots up but one &s;tem. Covered with
the &s;oil it &s;hoots up many. And tran&s;planted deeper in the &s;oil
many more. Potatoes, vines, and figs, produce lateral roots
from their joints. So does the bark if wounded circularly.
U&s;e of eating down forward wheat with &s;heep.</Q>
<P>I. 1. HAVING treated of the phy&s;iology, we now &s;tep for|wards
to con&s;ider the economy of vegetation, as far as it may
&s;erve the purpo&s;es of agriculture and gardening.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="135">
After the production of the &s;eed, or vegetable egg in the pe|ricarp
of flowers, and its en&s;uing impregnation by the farina of
the anthers &s;hed upon the &s;tigma, a coagulated point appears
on the &s;eed-lobes according to the ob&s;ervations of Spallanzani,
like the cicatricula on the yolk of the egg.</P>
<P>The &s;eed continues to grow in the pericarp &s;u&s;tained by
adapted &s;ecretions from the vegetable blood, which is previou&s;ly
oxygenated in the bractes or floral leaves of many plants; in
others the &s;eed is it&s;elf inclo&s;ed in an air-ve&s;&s;el probably for that
purpo&s;e, as in &s;taphylea, bladder-nut, and tagetes, African mary-gold.
At the &s;ame time a re&s;ervoir of nutriment is &s;ecreted,
and depo&s;ited in the &s;eed-lobes or cotyledons, which are &s;ingle
ones in the &s;eeds of palms, gra&s;&s;es, and lilies; though twofold
in tho&s;e of mo&s;t other herbs and trees; whence the &s;tricte&s;t ana|logy
exi&s;ts between &s;eeds and eggs.</P>
<P>2. In &s;ome &s;eeds, when they leave the vegetable uterus, this
embryon is much more mature than in others. In the &s;eeds
of
the nymphaea nelumbo the leaves of the future plant were &s;een
&s;o di&s;tinctly by Mr. Ferber, that he found out by them to what
plant the &s;eeds belonged. The &s;ame in the &s;eeds of the tulip-tree,
liriodendron tulipiferum. Amaen. Acad. V. VI. No. 120.
And Mr. Baker a&s;&s;erts, that on di&s;&s;ecting a &s;eed of trembling
gra&s;s, he di&s;covered by the micro&s;cope a perfect plant with roots
&s;ending forth two branches, from each of which &s;everal leaves
or blades of gra&s;s proceeded. Micro&s;c. Vol. I. p. 252. While
in other &s;eeds the corculum, or heart only of the &s;eed, is di&s;|tinctly
vi&s;ible, as in the kernel of the walnut, and the &s;eed of
the garden-bean. So in the animal kingdom the young of &s;ome
birds are much more mature at their birth than tho&s;e of others.
The chickens of phea&s;ants, quails, and partridges, can u&s;e their
eyes, run after their mothers, and peck their food, almo&s;t as
&s;oon as they leave their &s;hell; but tho&s;e of the linnet, thru&s;h,
and blackbird, continue many days totally blind, and can only
open their callow mouths for the offered mor&s;el.</P>
<P>3. When the &s;eed falls naturally upon the earth, or is buried
artificially in &s;hallow trenches beneath the &s;oil, the fir&s;t three
things nece&s;&s;ary to its growth are heat, water, and air. Heat
is the general cau&s;e of fluidity, without which no motion can
<PB N="130" REF="136">
exi&s;t; water is the men&s;truum, in which the nutriment of vege|table
and animal bodies is conveyed to their various organs; and
the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere is believed to afford the principle
of excitability &s;o perpetually nece&s;&s;ary to all organic life; and
which renders the living fibres both of the vegetable and animal
world obedient to the &s;timuli, which are naturally applied to
them.</P>
<P>Whence we may in &s;ome mea&s;ure comprehend a difficult
que&s;tion; why the plume of a &s;eed &s;owed upon, or in the earth,
&s;hould a&s;cend, and the root de&s;cend, which has been a&s;cribed to
a my&s;terious in&s;tinct; the plumula is &s;timulated by the air into
action, and elongates it&s;elf, where it is thus mo&s;t excited; and
the radicle is &s;timulated by moi&s;ture, and elongates it&s;elf thus,
where it is mo&s;t excited, whence one of them grows upwards
in que&s;t of its adapted object, and the other downward.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ource of nutriment &s;upplied to the &s;eminal embryon,
after it falls from the parent plant, exi&s;ts in the &s;eed-lobes, or
cotyledons, which either remain beneath the earth, and are
permeated by the umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the embryon plant, which
ab&s;orb the mucilaginous, farinaceous, or oily matter depo&s;ited
in them, as in the bean, pi&s;um; or the &s;eed-lobes ri&s;e up into
the air along with the young plant, as in the kidney-bean, pha|&s;eolus,
become &s;eed-leaves, and &s;erve both as a nutritive and
re&s;piratory organ. The&s;e cotyledons or &s;eed-lobes generally
contain mucilage, as in quince-&s;eed; or &s;tarch, as in wheat;
or oil, as in line-&s;eed. Some of the&s;e nutritive materials are
probably ab&s;orbed unchanged, or di&s;&s;olved only by the moi&s;ture
of the earth; others are converted into &s;ugar partly by a che|mical
proce&s;s, and partly by the dige&s;tive powers of the young
plant, as appears in the proce&s;s of germinating barley, and con|verting
it into malt; the&s;e re&s;ervoirs of nutriment are hence per|fectly
analogous to the white of the egg, a part of which is pro|bably
ab&s;orbed unchanged by the lymphatics of the young em|bryon,
and a part of it converted into a &s;weet chyle for the
nouri&s;hment of the chick, when it has acquired a &s;tomach.</P>
<P>If the &s;eed be deprived of the&s;e cotyledons, &s;oon after the
root appears, it will continue to grow, but with le&s;s vigour, and
is &s;aid to produce a dwarf plant from three to nine times le&s;s than
<PB N="131" REF="137">
the parent. Hence the &s;eeds of plants, which are liable to pro|duce
too vigorous roots, and thence have not time to ripen their
fruits in the &s;hort &s;ummers of this climate, or which fill our hot-beds
with too luxuriant foilage, as melons, and cucumbers,
&s;hould in this climate be kept three or four years; by which
part of the mucilaginous, or farinaceous, or oily matter of the
cotyledons becomes injured or decayed, and the new plant grows
le&s;s luxuriantly.</P>
<P>Another &s;ource of nutriment for the &s;eminal embryon of
many plants exi&s;ts in the fruit, which envelopes the &s;tone or
&s;eed-ve&s;&s;el, after the growing fetus has bur&s;t its confinement,
and &s;o far re&s;embles the yolk of the egg, which becomes a nu|triment
&s;o the chick, after it has con&s;umed the white, and elop|ed
from its &s;hell.</P>
<P>When mature fruit, as an apple or a cucumber, falls upon
the ground, it &s;upplies, as it ripens or decays, a &s;econd &s;ource
of nouri&s;hment, which enables the inclo&s;ed &s;eeds to &s;hoot their
roots into the earth, and to elevate their &s;tems with greater
vigour. Hence fruits generally contain a &s;accharine matter, or
juices capable of being converted into &s;ugar, either by a &s;pon|taneous
chemical proce&s;s, as in baking four apples; or by a
vegetable proce&s;s, as in tho&s;e &s;our pears, which continue to ripen
for many months, both before and after they are plucked from
the tree, as long as life remains in them; that is, till they fer|ment
or putrify; and la&s;tly, by the dige&s;tive power of the
young embryon, as above mentioned.</P>
<P>If the &s;eed be deprived of the fruit, it will indeed vegetate,
but with le&s;s vigour. Hence tho&s;e &s;eeds which are liable to
produce too vigorous &s;hoots for this climate, as the &s;eeds of
melons and cucumbers, &s;hould be wa&s;hed clean from their pulp,
before they are hoarded, and pre&s;erved three or four years be|fore
they are &s;own in hot-beds. But tho&s;e &s;eeds, which are
&s;own late in the &s;ea&s;on for the purpo&s;e of producing winter fod|der,
as the &s;eeds of turneps, &s;hould be collected and pre&s;erved
with every po&s;&s;ible advantage; and on this account new &s;eed is
much to be preferred to that which has been long kept.</P>
<P>4. Many &s;eeds when mature are di&s;per&s;ed far from the parent
tree, for the purpo&s;e of their growth, by various contrivances,
<PB N="132" REF="138">
as mentioned in Sect. VII. 2. 5. Some of the&s;e are &s;urround|ed
with hard &s;hells, which are impenetrable by in&s;ects, as they
lie on the earth to take root, as peaches, nectarines, nuts, cocoa|nuts.
Other &s;eeds are furni&s;hed with an acrid covering to pre|vent
the depredation of in&s;ects, as the peel of oranges and le|mons,
the outward hu&s;k and inward rind of walnuts, and of
ca&s;hew-nuts, and the &s;kin of mu&s;tard-&s;eed, and rape-&s;eed; other
&s;eeds for the &s;ame purpo&s;e abound with bitter or narcotic juices,
as the hor&s;e-che&s;nut, acorn, apricot, cherry, many of which
&s;upply materials to the &s;hops of medicine, and may &s;upply nutri|ment
in times of &s;carcity; as the &s;tarch, which they contain,
may be procured by grating them into cold-water, and wa&s;hing
away the $ucilage, and the poi&s;onous material, which adheres
to it, or which is &s;oluble in water.</P>
<P>5. The plumula of the &s;eed, or embryon plant, ab&s;orbs the
nutriment laid up for it in the &s;eed-lobes by ve&s;&s;els, which per|meate
them for that purpo&s;e, and have been termed umbilical
ve&s;&s;els; and afterwards &s;hoots its roots down into the fruit, or
into the earth, in &s;earch of other nouri&s;hment; and expands its
leaves in the air as an organ of re&s;piration.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e plants, which are u&s;ually termed annuals, produce
their flowers and die in the &s;ame year in which their &s;eeds are
&s;own; as barley, oats, and a variety of garden flowers. The&s;e
neverthele&s;s in accurate language &s;hould be termed biennials,
becau&s;e the &s;eed in this climate is produced in one &s;ummer; and
the embryon plant becomes mature in the next; as the &s;eed is
generally pre&s;erved in our granaries, or &s;eed-boxes, and not
committed to the ground till the en&s;uing &s;pring; for many of
the&s;e vegetables are not natives of this climate, and would peri&s;h
if the &s;eeds were &s;own in autumn, when it is naturally &s;cattered
on the earth.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which are u&s;ually termed biennial plants, differ from
the former, fir&s;t in the time of &s;owing the &s;eed, which is gene|rally
in the early autumn, as &s;oon as it is ripe, as of turneps,
carrots, wheat; and thus the&s;e produce their flowers in the &s;e|cond
year after the &s;eed is &s;own, which has given them the
name of biennials. Many of the&s;e plants, perhaps all of them,
lay up a re&s;ervoir of nutritious matter during the &s;ummer or au|tumn
<PB N="133" REF="139">
in their roots. This nutriment is &s;ecreted from the vege|table
blood, which is previou&s;ly oxygenated for that purpo&s;e in
the large leaves, which generally &s;urround the caudex of the
plant, as in turneps and carrots. The&s;e leaves &s;urvive the winter
in many plants, which the more &s;ucculent &s;tems probably would
not; and the nutriment depo&s;ited in the root is expended in the
growth of the &s;tem and the production of &s;eed in the en&s;uing
&s;pring. As in the&s;e vegetables one of our &s;ummers is too &s;hort
for their growth from the &s;eed to the fructification; and it is for
this re&s;ervoir of nutriment that the&s;e plants are generally culti|vated.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e plants, which are termed perennial, when fir&s;t rai&s;|ed
from &s;eed, are many of them &s;ome years before they produce
flowers. Some of them form bulbous roots, as the tulip, hya|cinth,
onion, which are three or four years before they flower,
during which time I believe all the bulbs die annually, producing
one larger than that of the preceding year, and perhaps &s;ome
&s;maller ones, all which annually increa&s;e in &s;ize till they flower.
The &s;ame occurs in potatoe-roots rai&s;ed from &s;eed, which do
not flower as I am informed till the third year, and then only
tho&s;e which &s;eemed of &s;tronger or forwarder growth.</P>
<P>Other perennial plants have palmated or branching roots; in
&s;ome of the&s;e, as in &s;eedling apple-trees, the flower is &s;aid not
to appear till ten or twelve years after the &s;eed is &s;own; the
buds neverthele&s;s annually dying and producing other buds over
them, perhaps more perfect ones, as they acquire after a few
years the power of producing &s;exual organs, and in con&s;equence
a &s;eminal progeny. In the&s;e perennial herbaceous plants and
trees a magazine of nutriment is provided in their roots or &s;ap|wood,
to &s;upply the new buds, which are to grow in the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that all the vegetables of this climate may
be termed biennial plants; as the &s;eeds of &s;ome, and the buds or
bulbs of others, are produced in one &s;ummer, and flouri&s;h and
die in the next; tho&s;e which are called annuals or biennials
leaving behind them a future progeny of &s;eeds only; tho&s;e,
which are termed perennial herbaceous plants, leaving behind
them the fir&s;t year or two a progeny of bulbs or root-buds only,
<PB N="134" REF="140">
and afterwards a progeny of &s;eeds al&s;o; while the perennial
arbore&s;cent vegetables leave behind them a progeny of buds
only for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, and afterwards a progeny of
both buds and &s;eeds.</P>
<P>Thus the bulb from a tulip-&s;eed produces a more perfect bulb
annually, till it flowers, I believe, on the fifth year. It then
produces a flower, and al&s;o one perfect bulb, which flowers the
next year; and &s;ome other le&s;s perfect bulbs, which are &s;uc|ceeded
by more perfect ones annually, till they al&s;o flower.
Whence I conclude, that no tulip bulb flowers till the fourth
or fifth generation.</P>
<P>It is probable, that a &s;imilar circum&s;tance occurs in other
vegetables, as in apple-trees; and that the buds of the&s;e do not
produce &s;exual organs, and a con&s;equent feminal progeny, till
the twelfth or fourteenth generation of the bud from the &s;eed;
each of tho&s;e buds neverthele&s;s producing one principal bud an|nually
more perfect than it&s;elf, and many lateral buds le&s;s per|fect
than it&s;elf; that is, at a greater di&s;tance from that &s;tate of
maturity which enables it to form a flower. This art of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
the greater or le&s;s maturity of buds is a matter of great
importance in the management of fruit-trees, as in many of them
the central bud becomes a &s;pur one year, and flowers the next;
and the lateral buds one or two years afterwards, as will be
mentioned in Sect. XV. on the production of fruit.</P>
<P>6. In wheat there exi&s;ts about the caudex a re&s;ervoir of nu|tritious
juices depo&s;ited in the autumn for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing
the &s;tem in the en&s;uing &s;pring like that of turneps and carrots;
but which is attended with other circum&s;tances peculiar I &s;up|po&s;e
to the gra&s;&s;es, and other plants, which po&s;&s;e&s;s only one
cotyledon or &s;eed-lobe. The early leaf, which &s;urrounds the
fir&s;t joint of the &s;tem, withers, as the &s;pring advances; in which
joint it had previou&s;ly depo&s;ited a &s;accharine juice, and proba|bly
&s;ome new embryon buds were at the &s;ame time generated
in the caudex; for through this withered leaf, which &s;urrounds
the fir&s;t joint of the &s;tem within the earth, a circular &s;et of new
&s;tems i&s;&s;ue adhering to it, and a circle of roots below them
adhering to the caudex or ba&s;e of it. The&s;e new buds ri&s;e into
air, and &s;hoot their roots into the earth; and in this manner
<PB N="135" REF="141">
many &s;tems are produced in the &s;pring from one &s;eed &s;owed in
the autumn preceding; though in &s;ome kinds of wheat the
whole proce&s;s of the &s;eed ri&s;ing from earth, and producing other
&s;tems round the principle one, and of ripening its &s;eeds, may be
performed in one &s;ummer even in this northern climate.</P>
<P>Another peculiarity attends the growth of wheat and other
gra&s;&s;es; the leaf, which &s;urrounds and &s;trengthens the &s;tem by
its foot-&s;talk, depo&s;its at every lower joint a &s;accharine matter
for the purpo&s;e of nouri&s;hing the a&s;cending part of the young
&s;tem; and in the uppermo&s;t joint, I &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;erve in&s;tead
of honey for the &s;tamens and &s;tigmas, as their flowers have no
vi&s;ible nectary; and as the &s;cales of the flower may with good
rea&s;on be e&s;teemed a calyx rather than a corol, according to the
opinion of Mr. Milne; as the&s;e &s;cales attend the &s;eed-ve&s;&s;el to
its maturity, which die corol does not. Milne's Botanical
Dict. Art. Gramina.</P>
<P>Owing to this &s;ecretion of &s;accharine matter at the foot-&s;talk
of every leaf, and its collection round the joints of gra&s;&s;es, it
happens that when the&s;e joints are &s;urrounded with moi&s;t earth,
and are placed but a certain depth from the air, that new buds
will put forth round the&s;e joints, and &s;trike their roots into the
&s;oil. Whence the agrarian hu&s;bandman may derive great ad|vantage
from tran&s;planting his wheat, after it has produced a cir|cle
of new &s;tems from the fir&s;t joint of the &s;traw; for if he then
parts and replants then an inch or two deeper in the ground, &s;o
as to cover the fir&s;t joint of each of the&s;e additional &s;tems, he
may multiply every one of them four or &s;ix times, and thus ob|tain
twenty or thirty &s;tems from one original &s;eed. See No. III.
1. and 7. of this &s;ection.</P>
<P>II. 1. Other vegetable embryons are produced in the buds
on the &s;tems or branches of trees, which may be termed the
viviparous progeny of plants, in contradi&s;tinction to tho&s;e from
&s;eeds, which may be termed their oviparous progeny. The&s;e
buds are either leaf-buds or flower-buds, or both in one cover|ing;
the bud is termed hybernaculum, or winter-cradle, of the
embryon &s;hoot, and is covered with &s;cales, and often with a
re&s;inous varni&s;h, as in tacamahacca, to protect it from the cold
<PB N="136" REF="142">
and moi&s;ture of the en&s;uing winter, and from the depredation of in&s;ects.</P>
<P>The&s;e by inoculation or ingrafting on other &s;tems of trees,
or by being planted in the earth, become plants exactly &s;imilar
to their parents. A &s;mall gla&s;s inverted over the&s;e buds, when
&s;et in the earth, contributes to in&s;ure their growth by preventing
too great an exhalation; otherwi&s;e they are liable to per&s;pire
more than they can ab&s;orb, before they have acquired roots;
this the gardeners call piping a &s;lip, or a cutting, of a plant.
In this &s;ituation a greater heat may be given them, as in hot-hou&s;es,
without increa&s;ing their quantity of per&s;piration, which
cea&s;es as &s;oon as the air in the gla&s;s is &s;aturated with moi&s;ture;
and the increa&s;e of heat much contributes to the protru&s;ion of their
roots and new buds, as they can at the &s;ame time bear to be
&s;upplied with a greater quantity of moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Every bud of mo&s;t of the deciduous trees of this climate may
therefore be con&s;idered as an individual biennial plant, as di&s;|tinctly
&s;o as a &s;eed; that is, the bud like a &s;eed is formed in
one &s;ummer, grows to maturity in the next, and then dies. In
&s;ome trees neverthele&s;s of this climate, as the mock orange,
philadelphus, acacia, viburnum; and in the evergreen &s;hrubs or
trees, as holly, laurel, vinca, heath, and rue; and in all tho&s;e
herbs commonly called annuals; and in mo&s;t of the trees of
warmer climates; the buds appear to be formed in the vernal
months, and to arrive at their maturity d$ring the &s;ame year; and may therefore properly be called annual plants.</P>
<P>2. The bud of the&s;e herbs, which are commonly called an|nuals,
ri&s;es in the bo&s;om of a leaf; and, as it adheres to its pa|rent,
requires no female apparatus to nouri&s;h it, but gradually
&s;trikes down roots from its caudex into the ground, which cau|dex
forms a part of the bark of the increa&s;ing plant. This
occurs in tho&s;e herbaceous vegetables, which have ju&s;t ri&s;en
from &s;eeds; the buds of which are properly individual annual
plants, which grow to maturity adhering to the parent, and do
not therefore re&s;emble a &s;eed or egg, as there is no re&s;ervoir of
nutriment laid up for them.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance al&s;o happens, I &s;uppo&s;e, to the evergreen
&s;hrubs and trees of this climate, as to heath, rue, box, pine,
<PB N="137" REF="143">
laurel; for in the&s;e vegetables, as the leaf does not die in the
autumn, it continues to oxygenate the blood, and to &s;upply
nouri&s;hment to the bud in its bo&s;om during the fine days of
winter, and in the &s;pring, and &s;urvives till near mid&s;ummer;
that is, till the new bud has expanded a leaf of its own. Whence
I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e evergreens lay up in &s;ummer no &s;tore of nutri|ment
in their roots or alburnum for the &s;u&s;tenance of their en|&s;uing
vernal buds; and have thence probably no bleeding &s;ea&s;on
like deciduous trees.</P>
<P>But the embryon in a bud of a deciduous plant leaves in the
&s;pring of the year its winter cradle, or hybernaculum, like the
embryon in a &s;eed, or a chick in the egg; and like the&s;e the
young plants of different vegetables have previou&s;ly arrived at
different &s;tates of maturity. Thus Mr. Ferber a&s;&s;erts, that he
was delighted in ob&s;erving in the buds of hepatica, and pedicu|laris
hir&s;uta, yet lying in the earth, and in the gems of the &s;hrub
daphne mezereon, and at the ba&s;e of o&s;munda lunaria a perfect
plant of the futute year di&s;cernible in all its parts; thus al&s;o in
hor&s;e-che&s;nut the leaves, and in cornel-tree the flowers, are each
di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible during the winter in their re&s;pective buds. Amoen.
Acad. Vol. VI. No. CXX. Milne's Dict. Art. Gemma.</P>
<P>While in buds of many other trees, and probably in all the
more backward buds, which are formed late in the &s;ummer on
the lower parts of branches, and much deprived of light and
air, the embryon is not &s;o forward as to be ea&s;ily di&s;cernible;
and in tho&s;e &s;hrubs or trees, which are deciduous in this climate,
and yet have no apparent buds in winter, as the philadelphus,
mock orange, viburnum, and many &s;hrubs. I &s;u&s;pect there is
neverthele&s;s an embryon &s;ecreted from the blood at the foot-&s;talk
of each leaf, though it is not &s;o forward as to protrude
through the bark, and produce a prominent bud, or hyberna|culum.
The &s;ame I &s;u&s;pect to occur in re&s;pect to trees, which
lo&s;e their leaves in winter, in warmer climates, in which they
are &s;aid not to produce autumnal buds; as I can not conceive
by what means fre&s;h leaf-buds can be generated in the &s;pring,
when the leaves, which con&s;titute the lungs of the mature living
part of the tree, are dead; and the whole of that mature living
part, or la&s;t year's bud, con&s;equently dead along with them.
<PB N="138" REF="144">
But if the caudex of the new bud be generated without the plu|mula,
or vi&s;ible bud, it can certainly produce a plumula for it|&s;elf
in the en&s;uing &s;pring, as is &s;een by the production of new
buds, when a branch is cut off, round the remaining trunk, as
is done frequently to the &s;tems of willows.</P>
<P>In &s;imilar manner the viviparous offspring of different animals
arrive at different &s;tates of perfection before they are born, as
calves and foals can &s;tand erect in an hour, and quickly learn to
u&s;e their eyes, and to run after their mothers; while the blind
puppy, and kitten, and the downle&s;s rabbit, are long before they
can leave the ne&s;t which the parent has provided for them.</P>
<P>4. The pre&s;ence of the pith or medulla is of great importance
to the growth of the new bud, as may be ob&s;erved by gradually
&s;licing a &s;hoot of a hor&s;e-che&s;nut in autumn, or in the early
&s;pring. The rudiments of the &s;even &s;eparate ribs of the late
parent-leaf, and the central pith of the bud in its bo&s;om, are
&s;een to ari&s;e or terminate near the pith of the parent &s;hoot,
where the embryon plumula is probably &s;ecreted by a gland at
the bottom of the parent leaf-&s;talk, finds there its fir&s;t reception
and nouri&s;hment, and is gradually protruded and elongated by
the pith, which exi&s;ts in its center, as the bud proceeds, and
thus con&s;titutes the a&s;cending caudex or uterus of the new bud;
which is re&s;embled by the wires of &s;trawberries, and other creep|ing
vegetables; whereas the de&s;cending caudexes of the new
buds, which form the filaments of the bark of trees, are &s;ecreted
from the various parts of the old bark in their vicinity; all
which probably occur at the &s;ame time by &s;ympathy, as &s;hewn
in Sect. VII.</P>
<P>The pith thus appears to be the fir&s;t or mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rudiment
of the new plant, like the brain or &s;pinal marrow, medulla ob|longata,
which is the fir&s;t vi&s;ible part of the figure, I believe,
of every animal fetus, from the tadpole to mankind.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e plants which have hollow &s;tems, this central cavity,
though not filled with the pith or medulla, appears to be lined
with it; as in picris and tragopogon; in the former the &s;tem is
not only lined with the pith, but wherever a new bud is generated
on the &s;ummit of the a&s;cending &s;tem, or in the bo&s;om of a leaf,
a membranous diaphragm divides the cavity, and is covered with
<PB N="139" REF="145">
this medullary &s;ub&s;tance, which divi&s;ion thus di&s;tingui&s;hes one
bud from another; and in &s;licing away the part of the &s;tem of
tragopogon, where the new lateral bud adheres, the medulla or
pith in the center of the bud is &s;een to commence near that
membrane which lines the &s;tem, and to pa&s;s through the circle
of arterial, venal, and ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which con&s;titute the
a&s;cending caudex, or uterus, of the new bud, while the de&s;cend|ing
caudex of it is &s;ecreted from the various parts of the older
bark in its vicinity.</P>
<P>Something &s;imilar to this mode of the production of the buds
of trees had not e&s;caped the ingenious Mr. Bradley, who a&s;&s;erts,
&startq;that buds have their fir&s;t ri&s;e in the pith; they are there fram|ed,
and furni&s;hed with every part of vegetation, and forced
for|wards
to meet the air through the tender bark, and would drop on the ground,
if they were not re&s;trained by ve&s;&s;els, which
&s;erve as roots to nouri&s;h them; and thus as a &s;eed takes root in
the earth, a bud takes root in the tree; but with this difference,
that the &s;eed has lobes to &s;upply it with nouri&s;hment, till it can
&s;elect juices from the earth; but the bud has no occa&s;ion for
lobes, becau&s;e it takes root immediately in the body of the tree,
where the proper juices are already prepared for it.&endq; Di&s;cour&s;es
on Growth of Plants, 1727, p. 56.</P>
<P>5. As the &s;eed was nouri&s;hed in the pericarp by an adapted
&s;ecretion from the vegetable blood oxygenated in the bractes or
floral-leaves; and as a re&s;ervoir of nutriment was al&s;o prepared
for it afterwards in the &s;eed-lobes and fruit: &s;o the bud is at
fir&s;t nouri&s;hed in the bo&s;om of its parent-leaf by an adapted &s;e|cretion
from the vegetable blood; and continues to be &s;o nou|ri&s;hed in
annual herbs and evergreen trees, till it protrudes and
expands its own leaf; but if it be a bud of a deciduous plant,
which mu&s;t lo&s;e its parent-leaf in winter, a re&s;ervoir of nutri|ment
is prepared for it in the roots of &s;ome plants, as in carrots,
turneps, liquorice, fern; and probably both in the roots and
alburnum, or &s;ap-wood, of trees.</P>
<P>Thus in the &s;pring the umbilical ve&s;&s;els belonging to each indi|vidual
biennial plant, or bud of a tree, ab&s;orb moi&s;ture from the
earth, and propel it upwards through the roots and alburnum,
where it is mixed with a nutritious material, and carried up|wards
in &s;ome trees with a power equal to the pre&s;&s;ure of the at|mo&s;phere,
<PB N="140" REF="146">
as in the vine, vitis; the birch, betula; and the ma|ple,
acer, which at that &s;ea&s;on bleed at every wound, as treated of in Sect. III.</P>
<P>6. At this time the buds begin to &s;well, and to &s;hoot roots
downwards from their caudexes into the earth; the intertex|ture
of the&s;e caudexes con&s;titutes a new bark over the old one,
con&s;i&s;ting of arteries, veins, and ab&s;orbents, as de&s;cribed in
Sect. I. 3. Each bud then al&s;o puts forth a leaf, which is a re&s;|piratory
organ, and re&s;embles in many re&s;pects the lungs of ani|mals,
as de&s;cribed in Sect IV. but differs from them in this cir|cum&s;tance,
that the leaf requires light as well as air for the pur|po&s;e
of perfect re&s;piration, as will be treated of in the Section on Light.</P>
<P>Each embryon of a leaf-bud is thus furni&s;hed with its proper
re&s;piratory organ; and as many new embryons were generated
during the &s;ummer in each leaf-bud, they now pullulate in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion;
each of which has like the fir&s;t its appropriate leaf, which,
as they &s;ucce&s;&s;ively advance, compo&s;e the annual shoots or &s;prigs
of trees; which in &s;ome plants become of great length, as in
vines, and willows, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty or thirty new
leaves.
Hence if the fir&s;t &s;et of leaves be de&s;troyed by vernal fro&s;ts, as
frequently happens to a&s;h-trees, fraxinus, and to the weeping
willow, &s;alix babylonica; or by the depredation of in&s;ects,
which often injures our fruit-trees; and perpetually occurs in
this climate to the &s;pindle-tree, euonymus; and in Italy to the
white mulberry-tree, which has its fir&s;t leaves plucked off for the
food of &s;ilk-worms, and to the tea-tree in China; a &s;econd &s;et
of leaves &s;ucceeds, which belong to the &s;econd embryons of the
&s;ame bud.</P>
<P>But when the bractes or floral-leaves are de&s;troyed by in&s;ects,
as &s;ometimes happens to currant-trees, and apple-trees; the fruit
in the pericarp does not peri&s;h, like the fir&s;t embryon of the leaf-bud
above mentioned; becau&s;e it is &s;till &s;upplied by the ab&s;orbent
&s;y&s;tem of the caudex and roots of the flower-bud, which compo&s;e
a part of the bark, and pa&s;s into the ground; but the fruit be|comes
&s;our and le&s;s perfect from the want of a due oxygenation
of the juices, from which it is &s;ecreted; though its glands may
probably al&s;o receive &s;ome oxygenated blood by the ino&s;culation
of the ve&s;&s;els of different buds, whether flower-buds or leaf-buds,
<PB N="141" REF="147">
with each other in the bark, on &s;uppo&s;ition that they are
not all of them totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>7. In the axilla of each leaf is generally produced about mid-&s;ummer
either a new leaf-bud or a flower-bud; if it be a leaf-bud,
it becomes a branch the next year, producing many other leaves,
and many other buds; if it be a flower-bud, the growth cea&s;es,
terminating in the &s;eed. During the greater vigour of the plant
the leaf-buds are &s;olely or principally produced, as in young
healthy trees, but when the ve&s;&s;els of the bark become further
elongated, as the plant grows taller, the nutritive juices are le&s;s
copiou&s;ly &s;upplied, or the buds are become more mature, and
the production of flower-buds &s;ucceeds as in Mr. Walker's ex|periments
the &s;ap of the birch-tree in the &s;pring was two or three
weeks later in a&s;cending to the top of a high tree, than to the
lower branches. Edinb. Tran&s;act. Vol. I.</P>
<P>Hence it happens, that the grafts from &s;trong &s;eedling apple-trees
do not bear fruit, till they are twelve or twenty years old;
while the grafts from old weak trees will bear copiou&s;ly in two
or three years, and hence very vigorous trees, as pears, produce
fruit only at their extremities; but if you decorticate about an
inch of a branch of a vigorous pear-tree, and thus weaken it;
that branch will flower, and bear fruit at every bud like trees of
le&s;s vigour.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be here ob&s;erved, that the words &s;trength and weak|ne&s;s,
when applied to the growth of vegetables, are in reality
metaphorical terms; or expre&s;s the effect or con&s;equence of their
producing leaf-buds or flower-buds, rather than the cau&s;e of it,
whereas it is the facility with which the long caudexes of the new
buds, which form the new filaments of bark, can be generated,
which increa&s;es the number of leaf-buds, and gives the tree a luxuriant or vigorous appearance; and the difficulty of gene|rating
the&s;e new caudexes which increa&s;es the flower-buds, and
thus gives a le&s;s vigorous appearance to the tree.</P>
<P>The generation of buds &s;eems to require a le&s;s perfect appara|tus
than the generation of &s;eeds; as that of buds always precedes
that of &s;eeds, both in trees and herbs; and because the cater|pillar
is converted into a butterfly &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of &s;emi|nal
propagation; whereas the polypus can only propagate la|terally,
<PB N="142" REF="148">
or by buds. Hence the age of the plant is another ne|ce&s;&s;ary
circum&s;tance to the production of flowers, fruit, and &s;eeds,
as appears in tulips, and hyacinths, as well as in apple-trees and
pear-trees.</P>
<P>8. About mid&s;ummer the new buds are formed; but it is be|lieved
by &s;ome of the Linnean &s;chool, that the&s;e buds may in
their early &s;tate be either converted into flower-buds or leaf-buds,
according to the vigour of the vegetating branch. Thus if the
upper part of a branch be cut away, the buds near the extremity
of the remaining &s;tem, having a greater proportional &s;upply of
nutriment, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a greater facility of producing their
new caudexes along the bark, will become leaf-buds; which
might otherwi&s;e have been flower-buds; and on the contrary, if
a vigorous branch of a wall-tree, which was expected to bear
only leaf-buds, be bent down to the horizon or lower, it will
bear flower-buds with weaker leaf-buds, as is much exemplified
by Mr. Hitt in his Treati&s;e on Fruit Trees.</P>
<P>The theory of this curious vegetable fact has been e&s;teemed
difficult, but receives great light from the foregoing account of
the individuality of buds. Both the flower-buds and leaf-buds
die in the autumn; but the leaf-buds, as they advance, produce
during the &s;ummer other leaf-buds or flower-buds in the axilla of
every leaf; which new buds require new caudexes extending
down the bark, and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch;
whereas the flower-buds &s;hed their &s;eed, when they peri&s;h in the
autumn, and thus require no place on the bark for new caudexes.
Hence when the &s;ummit of a branch is lopped off, the buds near
the extremity of the remaining &s;tem produce new leaf-buds with
greater facility, as there is more room for their new caudexes to
be generated along the de&s;cending bark. But if a vigorous
branch be bent down to the horizon, or below it, the bark is
compre&s;&s;ed beneath the curve, and extended above it, and thus
the production of new caudexes along the bark is impeded, and
in con&s;equence le&s;s leaf-buds and more flower-buds will be gene|rated,
or the former converted into the latter; which require no
new caudexes. And on this circum&s;tance principally depends
the management of wall-fruit trees, and of e&s;palliers.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="149">
For the purpo&s;e of thus converting leaf-buds into flower-buds
Mr. Whitmill advi&s;ed to bind &s;ome of the mo&s;t vigorous &s;hoots
with &s;trong wire, and even &s;ome of the large roots; and Mr.
Warner cuts, what he calls, a wild-worm about the body of the
tree; or &s;cores the bark quite to the wood like a &s;crew with a
&s;harp knife. Bradley on Gardening, Vol. II. p. 155. Mr.
Fitzgerald produced flowers and fruit on &s;tandards and wall-trees
by cutting off a cylinder of the bark, three or four inches long,
and replacing it with proper bandage, (Philo&s;. Tran&s;. Ann.
1761) as de&s;cribed in Sect. XV. 1. 3. of this work. M. Buffon
produced the &s;ame effect by a &s;traight bandage put round a
branch, Act Paris, Ann, Ann. 1738; and concludes that an
ingrafted branch bears better from its ve&s;&s;els being compre&s;&s;ed by
the callus produced, where the grafted &s;cion joins the &s;tock.</P>
<P>It is cu&s;tomary to debark oak-trees in the &s;pring, which are
intended to be felled in the en&s;uing autumn; becau&s;e the bark
comes off ea&s;ier at this &s;ea&s;on, and the &s;ap-wood, or alburnum, is
believed to become more durable, if the trees remain till the
end of &s;ummer from their expending their &s;accharine &s;ap-juice in
the en&s;uing foliage, and thus being le&s;s liable to ferment and pu|trify.
The trees thus &s;tripped of their bark put forth &s;hoots as
u&s;ual with acorns on, the sixth, &s;eventh, and eighth joint, like
vines; but in the branches I examined the joints of the debarked
trees were much &s;horter than tho&s;e of other oak-trees; the acorns
were more numerous; and no new buds were produced above
the joints which bore acorns. From hence it appears that the
branches of debarked oak-trees produce fewer leaf-buds, and
more flower-buds; which mu&s;t be owing to the impo&s;&s;ibility of
their producing new caudexes down the naked branches and
&s;tem for the embryon progeny of leaf-buds.</P>
<P>The pullulation of leaves on debarked oaks demon&s;trates, that
the re&s;ervoirs of nutriment depo&s;ited in the preceding &s;ummer for
the u&s;e of the vernal buds mu&s;t be in this alburnum; and that it
is this &s;accharine matter which induces the alburnum to ferment
and rot &s;ooner than the internal wood. Thus Dr. Walker
found on nice in&s;pection the &s;ap-juice to flow from the ligneous
circles of the alburnum as well as between them, when a fre&s;h
piece was cut off from a cicatrized part, and al&s;o between the
<PB N="144" REF="150">
wood and the bark. Edinb. Tran&s;act. Vol. I. He al&s;o ob|&s;erved
that oak, a&s;h, elm, a&s;pen, hazel, and hawthorn, do not
bleed; and that the birch, plane, and maple bleed the mo&s;t,
and that the grey willow, &s;alix caprea, does not bleed, but the
&s;ap-juice ri&s;es vi&s;ibly between the wood and the bark, &s;o as to
make the bark &s;eparate ea&s;ily from the wood. From all the&s;e
facts it may be inferred, that the &s;accharine matter, which is di&s;|&s;olved
in the &s;ap-juice, is depo&s;ited in the autumn in the roots of
&s;ome trees, and in the alburnum of others, or in both; as
manna is found in the wood of the manna-a&s;h; and &s;ugar in the
joints of many gra&s;&s;es and of the &s;ugar-cane, and in the roots of
liquorice, beets, and many other herbaceous vegetables.</P>
<P>9. About Mid&s;ummer, after the new buds appear in the bo&s;om
of every leaf, many authors have remarked that there &s;eems to
be a kind of pau&s;e in vegetation for about a fortnight, which
they have a&s;cribed to different cau&s;es. At this time I &s;u&s;pect the
re&s;ervoir of nouri&s;hment for the new buds is forming about the
roots or in the alburnum of the tree; and that the caudexes and
umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the new buds are al&s;o at this time forming
down the bark, and terminate in tho&s;e nutritious re&s;ervoirs
in the
roots or new alburnum like the umbilical ve&s;&s;els called &s;eminal
roots, which are vi&s;ible in many &s;eeds.</P>
<P>That this &s;y&s;tem of umbilical ve&s;&s;els is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great
power of ab&s;orption in the roots of trees is certain from the
force, with which the &s;ap-juice was propelled upward from a
vine-&s;tump in Dr. Hales' experiment. That the &s;ap-juice thus
propelled upward nouri&s;hes or expands the leaf of each new
bud appears from the experiments of Dr. Walker; as the leaves
began to unfold at the &s;ame height, as the wounded wood began
to bleed, and that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els pa&s;s through or con&s;titute the &s;ap|wood
is evinced by the growth of the buds on oak-trees, after
the bark is almo&s;t totally taken off.</P>
<P>The roots of trees are at this time protruded with greater vi|gour,
as ob&s;erved by the ingenious Mr. Bradley, who on that
account prefers the mid&s;ummer &s;ea&s;on for tran&s;planting trees, if
they are not to be removed to any great di&s;tance; and adds,
that the new &s;hoots in the following spring will put forth with
much greater force, and the tree will thence be almo&s;t a year
<PB N="145" REF="151">
forwarder in its growth, than if it remains untran&s;planted till the
winter. Di&s;cour&s;es on Earth and Water. This &s;eems to be
owing to the de&s;truction of much of the nutritious matter depo|&s;ited
in the roots for the u&s;e of the new buds, which is torn off
in tran&s;planting, and which can only be replaced about Mid&s;um|mer
or &s;oon after.</P>
<P>Mr. Bradley further adds, that when trees are thus tran&s;|planted
at Mid&s;ummer, no part of the top or branches, or foliage,
&s;hould at that time be cut off; which well accords with the
theory above delivered; as it is from the vegetable blood, which
is oxygenated by its expo&s;ure to the air through the thin
moi&s;t pellicle on the upper &s;mooth &s;urfaces of the&s;e leaves,
that the nutriment for the expan&s;ion of the buds in the &s;ucceed|ing
&s;pring is &s;ecreted or produced; and hence if the&s;e leaves are
prematurely de&s;troyed, the vernal growth of the buds mu&s;t re|ceive
injury; as the re&s;ervoir of future nutriment for them will
be le&s;s in quantity; but if &s;ome of the branches are lopped
during the winter, the remainder will protrude more vigorous
&s;hoots, as their &s;hare of the re&s;erved nutriment will be greater.</P>
<P>10. The umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the new buds of deciduous trees,
which are analogous to tho&s;e which permeate the lobes of the
&s;eed, are extended downward in the bark about mid&s;ummer, and
terminate in certain re&s;ervoirs of nutriment, which are at this
time &s;ecreted from the vegetable blood oxygenated in the leaves.
This bark now con&s;i&s;ts of an intertexture of the caudexes of
the pre&s;ent leaves, which were buds in the la&s;t &s;ummer, and are
now adult vegetable beings; and of the embryon caudexes of
the new buds; and of the umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the new buds; it
will become alburnum or &s;ap-wood during the autumn or en&s;uing
&s;pring, and will be gradually covered over with a new bark con|&s;i&s;ting
of the mature caudexes of the new buds, while that, which
was the alburnum in the preceding &s;pring, will become a circle
of lifele&s;s timber, interior to the circle of alburnum.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els of this new bark, though they con&s;i&s;t of the cau|dexes
of the individual adult leaves, and the umbilical ve&s;&s;els of
the individual young buds, evidently ino&s;culate; becau&s;e, when
&s;ome buds are rubbed off or de&s;troyed, tho&s;e in their vicinity
grow with greater vigour; as the daily experience of pruning all
<PB N="146" REF="152">
kinds of trees evinces. The facility with which the ruptured
ve&s;&s;els of vegetables ino&s;culate into each other, or grow together,
corre&s;ponds with that of animal ve&s;&s;els in their inflamed &s;tate.
Thus a bud taken from one tree, and in&s;erted into any part of
the bark of another tree of the &s;ame genus, or ingrafted on it,
pre&s;ently receives nutriment, and grows to it by the reciprocal
ino&s;culation of the wounded ve&s;&s;els, in the &s;ame manner as a
tran&s;planted tooth; or as the fingers are liable to grow together
after having been excoriated by a burn; or as the inflamed lungs
and pleura are liable to adhere, and intermix their blood-ve&s;&s;els.
See Sect. III. 2. 7.</P>
<P>During the winter, when the leaves die and fall off, the arte|rial
and venous &s;y&s;tems, which belonged to them, and which
compo&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the bark, &s;eem to lo&s;e their vege|table
life at the &s;ame time, and to coale&s;ce, and form the albur|num,
or &s;ap-wood; but the umbilical ve&s;&s;els belonging to the new buds, which are intermixed with this alburnum, remain alive;
aad at the returning &s;pring act with astoni&s;hing vigour; as de|&s;cribed
in Sect. III. 2. 2.</P>
<P>As the &s;pring advances, the umbilical ve&s;&s;els after having drank
up the re&s;ervoirs of nutriment, which were depo&s;ited about the
roots, and having thus nouri&s;hed and expanded the new leaves,
cea&s;e to act; and the alburnum gradually changes into hard
wood, called the heart of the tree; which no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
vegetative life; and is now only u&s;eful to elevate and &s;u&s;tain aloft
the &s;warm of biennial plants, which cover it; and was probably
originally produced for this purpo&s;e in the conte&s;t of all vegetables
for light and air.</P>
<P>This inert or lifele&s;s &s;tate of the central parts of trees, called
the heart-wood, is evident from tho&s;e old oaks and willows,
which have lo&s;t their internal hard wood, and are become quite
hollow, con&s;i&s;ting only of their bark and alburnum, and yet are
furni&s;hed with many healthy branches. But the umbilical ve&s;&s;els
of the alburnum po&s;&s;e&s;s the properties of capillary tubes, or of a
&s;ponge, after they are extinct, and cea&s;e to act as umbilical ve&s;|&s;els;
and thus may occa&s;ionally attract moi&s;ture, or &s;uffer it to
pa&s;s through them mechanically; whil&s;t the new bark, which
con&s;i&s;ts of an intertexture of the caudexes of each bud with their
<PB N="147" REF="153">
radicles, may occa&s;ionally ab&s;orb this moi&s;ture from the capillary
ve&s;&s;els of the alburnum, which may be compared to the upper
&s;tratum of the &s;oil attracting by capillary power the moi&s;ture
from the &s;oil immediately beneath it, which may exhale into the
atmo&s;phere, or be imbibed by the roots of vegetables by the &s;u|perior
living power of their ab&s;orbent mouths.</P>
<P>That the ve&s;&s;els of the alburnum in their living &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;s
the property of conveying the &s;ap-juice, which is propelled up|wards
in the early &s;pring by the ab&s;orbent terminations of the
roots, is vi&s;ible in decorticated oaks; the branches of which ex|pand
their buds, like tho&s;e of the birch and vine in the bleeding
&s;ea&s;on. That the ve&s;&s;els of the alburnum in their living &s;tate oc|ca&s;ionally
act as capillary &s;yphons, through which the &s;ap-juice is
fir&s;t pu&s;hed upwards by the ab&s;orbent extremities of the roots,
and afterwards returns downwards partly by its gravitation in
branches bent below the horizon, appears from an experiment of
Dr. Walker, mentioned in Sect. III. 2. 4.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, that the ve&s;&s;els of the alburnum after their vegetable
life is extinct, po&s;&s;e&s;s a power of capillary attraction of the &s;ap-juice,
or of permitting it to pa&s;s through them occa&s;ionally, ap|pears
from the following experiments. Fir&s;t, a branch of a
young apple-tree was &s;o cankered, that the bark for about an
inch quite round it was totally de&s;troyed. To prevent the albur|num
from becoming too dry by exhalation, this decayed part
was covered with thick white paint; in a few days the painting
was repeated, and this three or four times, &s;o as to produce a
thick coat of paint over the decayed part, or naked alburnum,
extending to the a&s;cending and de&s;cending lips of the wound;
this was in &s;pring, and the branch blo&s;&s;omed and ripened &s;everal
apples.</P>
<P>In a garden in Lichfield about four years ago a complete cy|linder
of bark about an inch long was cut from a branch of a
pear-tree nailed again&s;t a wall; the circumci&s;ed part is now not
more than half the diameter of the &s;ame branch above and below
it; yet this branch has been full of fruit every year &s;ince, when
the other branches of the tree have borne only &s;paringly. I lately
ob&s;erved, that the leaves of this wounded branch were &s;maller
and paler, and the fruit le&s;s in &s;ize, and ripened a fortnight
<PB N="148" REF="154">
&s;ooner, than on the other parts of the tree. Another branch
of the &s;ame tree has a part of the bark taken off about an inch
long, but not quite all round it, with much the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of capillary tubes in dead &s;ap-wood is vi&s;ible
in a piece of dry cane, which permit water or &s;moke to pa&s;s
through them; and in the exhau&s;ted receiver of an air-pump
both water and quick&s;ilver may be made readily to pa&s;s through
pieces of the dry alburnum of wood by the pre&s;&s;ure of the at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P>11. The flower-buds of many trees ari&s;e immediately from
the la&s;t year's terminal &s;hoots, or &s;purs, either accompanied with
leaf-buds, or &s;eparately, as in apple and pear-trees. Other flower-buds
ari&s;e from the &s;hoots as the pre&s;ent year alternately with
leaf-buds, as tho&s;e of vines, and form the third or fourth buds of
the new &s;hoots. They differ from leaf-buds in this circum|&s;tance,
that they peri&s;h when their &s;eeds are ripe, without pro|ducing
any addition or increa&s;e to the tree; whereas when the
leaf-buds peri&s;h in the autumn, their caudexes, the intertexture
of which con&s;titutes the bark of the tree, gradually become
converted into alburnum, or &s;ap-wood; over which the new
leaf-buds &s;hoot forth their caudexes and radicles, or in&s;ert them
into it, and gradually fabricate the new bark and root-fibres.</P>
<P>It was before mentioned, that it is believed by &s;ome di&s;ciples
of the Linnean &s;chool, that about Mid&s;ummer leaf-buds may be
changed into flower-buds, or flower-buds into leaf-buds; and
that even after the vegetable embryons are generated. And that
this may be effected by weakening or &s;trengthening the growth of
the la&s;t year's buds, which &s;ecrete the&s;e new ones from the vege|table
blood, and nouri&s;h them in their infant &s;tate. Thus if
&s;ome inches of the extremity of a branch be lopped off at Mid-&s;ummer,
as is &s;ometimes done by un&s;kilful gardeners, the re|maining
few buds will become more vigorous, and con&s;equently
produce leaf-buds in&s;tead of flower-buds; or perhaps the em|bryons
already formed may be converted from one kind to the
other. The contrary may occur, if a vigorous branch of a
wall-tree be bent down beneath the horizon, or &s;o much as to
impede the generation of new caudexes; or if the leaf of the
<PB N="149" REF="155">
parent-bud be taken off, &s;oon after the plumula or apex of the
new bud is generated; and thus the new caudex along the bark
may be prevented by deficiency of nutriment.</P>
<P>The probability of this idea of tran&s;muting flower-buds and
leaf-buds into each other is confirmed by the curious conver&s;ion
of the parts of the flowers of &s;ome vegetable mon&s;ters into green
leaves; if they be too well nouri&s;hed, after they are &s;o far ad|vanced
as to be unchangeable into leaf-buds. Thus in the plan|tago,
ro&s;ea, ro&s;e-plantain, the divi&s;ions of the &s;pike become won|derfully
enlarged, and are converted into leaves; the chaffy
&s;cales of the calyx in xeranthenum, everlasting, and in a &s;pe|cies
of dianthus, pink, and the glume of &s;ome alpine gra&s;&s;es,
and the &s;cales in the ament of the &s;alix ro&s;ea, ro&s;e willow, grow
into leaves, and produce other kinds of vegetable mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>Add to this, that the petals of the helleborus niger, or
chri&s;tmas-ro&s;e, are beautifully white till the &s;eed is impregnated;
and then they change into green leaves, forming a calyx. And
la&s;tly, in other flowers a bud or bulb &s;ucceeds the impregnation
in&s;tead of a &s;eed, as in polygonum viviparum, viviparous bi&s;tort;
and in allium magicum, magical onion; the &s;ame occurs in many
of the alpine gra&s;&s;es, and in the fe&s;tuca dumetorum, fe&s;cue gra&s;s;
all which are in &s;ome degree analogous to the &s;uppo&s;ed conver&s;ion
of early flower-buds into leaf-buds; for in the&s;e magical onions,
and other bulbiferous flowers, the bractes or floral-leaves, which
at fir&s;t &s;ecrete nouri&s;hment for the pericarp and &s;eeds of the plant,
a&s;&s;ume a new office, and &s;ecrete a magazine of nouri&s;hment for
the new bulb, as appears in the concentric fle&s;hy membranes, which &s;urround the new &s;ummit-bulbs of the allium magicum, and the cloves of garlic.</P>
<P>12. The central part of an adult bud therefore con&s;i&s;ts fir&s;t
of a conjunction of the blood-ve&s;&s;els from above and below,
which exi&s;ts in the caudex of the bud between the beginning of
the leaf-ve&s;&s;els and the beginning of the root-ve&s;&s;els; the circula|tion
re&s;embling that of many in&s;ects, of fi&s;h and in the livers of
quadrupeds, as &s;hewn in Sect. V. 2. Secondly, there is probably
at the &s;ame place a conjunction of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els corre&s;pondent
to the receptaculum chyli of animals. Thirdly, there
<PB N="150" REF="156">
exi&s;ts in each bud an organ of reproduction, which in a leaf-bud
produces the lateral or paternal offspring, and in a flower-bud
the &s;eminal or amatorial one. Fourthly, a center of ner|vous
influence, as a brain, or &s;pinal marrow, or common &s;en&s;o|rium,
exi&s;ts in each bud; and probably re&s;ides near this junction
of the blood-ve&s;&s;els of the leaf and root, and of the ab&s;orbent
&s;y&s;tem, along with the organ of reproduction in the caudex
gemmae.</P>
<P>III. 1. THE BULBOUS ROOTS of &s;ome perennial herbace|ous
plants, and the root-&s;cions of other perennial herbaceous
plants, are &s;imilar in this re&s;pect, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from
buds; that they are generated on the broad caudex of the plant
within the ground, or in contact with it, and immediately &s;hoot
down their new roots into the earth. Whereas buds are formed
above the &s;oil on the long caudexes, which con&s;titute the fila|ments
of the bark of trees, and &s;hoot down new roots into the
earth from the lower end of the&s;e elongated caudexes.</P>
<P>Bulbs have not improperly been called &s;ubterraneous buds;
and like them they may be divided into leaf-bulbs and flower-bulbs.
When a tulip-&s;eed is &s;own, it produces a &s;mall plant
the fir&s;t &s;ummer, which in the autumn dies, and leaves in its
place one or more bulbs. The&s;e are leaf-bulbs, which in the
en&s;uing &s;pring ri&s;e into &s;tronger plants than tho&s;e of the fir&s;t
year, but no flowers are yet generated; in the autumn the&s;e
perish like the former, and leave in their places other leaf-bulbs
&s;tronger, or more perfect, than their preceding parents. This
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of leaf-bulbs continues for four or five years, till at
length the bulb acquires a greater perfection or maturity, nece&s;&s;|ay
for &s;eminal generation, and produces in its place a large
flower-bulb in the centre with &s;everal &s;mall leaf-bulbs around it.</P>
<P>This &s;ucce&s;&s;ive formation of leaf-bulbs in bulbous rooted plants
previous to the formation of a flower-bulb is curiou&s;ly analogous
to the production of leaf-buds, on many trees for &s;everal years
before the production of flower-buds; thus the apple-trees, pyrus
malus, which are rai&s;ed from &s;eeds, generate only leaf-buds for
ten or twelve years, and afterwards annually generate both
<PB N="151" REF="157">
flower-buds and leaf-buds. From whence it would &s;eem, that that
the adherent lateral or paternal progeny is the mo&s;t &s;imple,
and ea&s;ie&s;t, and con&s;equently the fir&s;t mode of reproduction; and
that the amatorial or &s;eminal progeny is on this account not ge|nerated
till the maturer age or more perfect &s;tate of the parent-bud.</P>
<P>A &s;till more curious analogy to this circum&s;tance of a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of leaf-buds and leaf-bulbs preceding the formation of flower-buds
and flower-bulbs exi&s;ts in the growth of wheat, triticum,
and other gra&s;&s;es; but with this difference, that a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
leaf-buds, as of two, or three, or four, are produced in the
&s;ame year previous to the flower-bud. At the fir&s;t joint of the
&s;tem of wheat, on or within the &s;urface of the earth, a leaf is
produced; from which ri&s;es the principal or central-bud, and
around it many new buds, which &s;trike their roots into the &s;oil.
After this central bud, and tho&s;e around it, have ari&s;en &s;ix or
eight inches, a new leaf and a new leaf-bud ri&s;es on each of
them, producing a &s;econd joint of the &s;tem; and la&s;tly, a flower-bud
is generated at the &s;ummit, which are all evidently di&s;tinct
vegetable beings, as there is a divi&s;ion acro&s;s the &s;tem at each
joint, which &s;hews there is no connexion of the pith, or brain, or &s;pinal marrow, between the lower and upper joints, as men|tioned
in Sect. I. 8.</P>
<P>That a new bud thus con&s;titutes each joint of the &s;tem of
wheat, and other gra&s;&s;es, is further evinced; fir&s;t, by the exi&s;t|ence
of a leaf at each joint without a lateral bud in its axilla,
as occurs in other vegetables. Secondly, becau&s;e for the nou|ri&s;hment
of this new leaf-bud a re&s;ervoir of &s;weet-juice is pre|pared
in the new joint; as in the bulbs of many plants. And
thirdly, becau&s;e the lower leaf dies, and the &s;weet juice is ab|&s;orbed,
as the upper leaf becomes vegete. Hence we acquire
the knowledge of the u&s;e of this re&s;ervoir of &s;ugar in the vegeta|ble
economy, which &s;upplies &s;o much agreeable and &s;alutary
nouri&s;hment to mankind from the cultivation of the &s;ugar-cane.
See No. 1. 6. and No. 3. 7. of this Section.</P>
<P>The analogy between the buds of plants and the adherent
lateral progeny of &s;ome in&s;ects, as of the polypus, and tenia,
or tape-worm, and volvox, was mentioned in Sect. VII. 1. 4.
<PB N="152" REF="158">
But the circum&s;tance of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive production of leaf-buds
and leaf-bulbs previous to the production of flower-buds or
flower-bulbs is wonderfully analogous to the generation of the
aphis, which ri&s;ing from an egg in the &s;pring after ca&s;ting its
&s;kin once or twice produces a living progeny without amatorial
copulation; and this offspring produces others by this &s;olitary
propagation till the tenth generation; then a &s;exual progeny of
males and females is produced, and eggs are laid in the autumn
from their amatorial intercour&s;e. Encycloped. Britan. Amoeni|tat.
Academ. Vol. VII. by A. T. Bladh. See Sect. XIV. 3. 2.
Thus this in&s;ect from the egg requires to be reproduced many
times by &s;olitary propagation before it becomes &s;ufficiently per|fect
to generate a &s;exual offspring like the buds and bulbs from
&s;eeds above mentioned. And it is probable, that the polypus
of our &s;tagnant waters, which produces a lateral offspring in the
&s;ummer, I &s;uppo&s;e by &s;olitary propagation, may produce males
and females, and generate eggs in con&s;equence in the autumn
for their reproduction in the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>To this may be added the great change, which many in&s;ects
and even larger animals undergo either in &s;trength or form, be|fore
they acquire the power of &s;eminal reproduction. As the
&s;ilk-worm changes into a butterfly apparently for the purpo&s;e of
generation only, as it then performs this office and dies. Other
caterpillars change their form likewi&s;e into butterflies, and at
the &s;ame time change their kind of food, which was the green
foliage of vegetables before this transformation; but now con|&s;i&s;ts
&s;olely of honey. And la&s;tly, the gnat and mu&s;queto
change at the &s;ame time both their forms, their food, and their
element; and thus acquire higher animation apparently for the
purpo&s;e of &s;exual reproduction.</P>
<P>2. The manner of the production of herbaceous plants from
their various perennial roots wants further inve&s;tigation, as their
analogy is not yet clearly a&s;certained. I this autumn di&s;&s;ected
two large roots of the onion or leek kind, which were in full
flower; the &s;tem of each of them was embraced by the cylindri|cal
pedicles of &s;ix or &s;even concentric leaves; but the &s;tem it|&s;elf
aro&s;e from the center between three large new bulbs in one
of them, and between two in the other. All of which grew
<PB N="153" REF="159">
from the &s;ame caudex, but the central flower-&s;tem was wrapped
at its bottom in one membrane only, which &s;eparated it from
the new bulbs in its vicinity.</P>
<P>A large root of a young onion, which grew form &s;eed &s;own in
the &s;pring, was at the &s;ame time di&s;&s;ected by &s;tripping off the
eaves, and their fle&s;hy ba&s;es, one after another, till two buds
were vi&s;ible in the center of the fle&s;hy ba&s;es of the concentric
leaves, which formed the bulb. The&s;e two bulbs were evidently
formed and nouri&s;hed on the caudex by the &s;tem, and its &s;ix
or &s;even concentric cylindrical leaves; and will, I &s;uppose, &s;e|parate
in the &s;pring, as they ri&s;e up, and produce each of them
a flower with two or three new bulbs at the ba&s;e of it, as de|&s;cribed
in the above paragraph.</P>
<P>Or from the different &s;ize and apparent greater maturity of
the central bulb, and the &s;econdary bulb being between the in|nermo&s;t
and the &s;econd circular fle&s;hy membrane, I &s;uppo&s;e in
the&s;e roots of onion, like the tulip-roots before &s;poken of, that
the central bulb, alone may produce a flower in the next &s;um|mer;
and that the lateral bulb or bulbs will produce only &s;tronger
and more mature leaf-bulbs, which will in the &s;ucceeding &s;um|mer
bear a flower or &s;exual progeny.</P>
<P>The caudex, or central part of the bulb, from which the
root-fibres de&s;cend, and the leaves a&s;cend, lies above the knot
in the orchis morio; and the parent-root &s;hrivels up and dies,
as the young one increa&s;es. The flower of this plant does not
ripen its &s;eeds in this climate; it might be otherwi&s;e worth cul|tivation
for the u&s;e of the new roots; which when &s;calded and
peeled, are &s;aid to be the &s;alep of the &s;hops. It is a&s;&s;erted by
one of the Linnean &s;chool in the Amoen. Academ. that if the
new root be pinched off, the &s;eeds on the old one will ripen, and become prolific.</P>
<P>In the tulip the caudex lies below the bulb, from whence
proceed the fibrous roots and the new bulbs; the root after it
has flowered dies like the orchis root; for the &s;tem of the la&s;t
year's tulip lies on the out&s;ide, and not in the center of the new
bulb. In the tulip-root, di&s;&s;ected in the early &s;pring, ju&s;t before
it begins to &s;hoot, a perfect flower is &s;een in its center; and
between the fir&s;t and &s;econd coat the large next year's bulb is, I
<PB N="154" REF="160">
believe, produced; between the &s;econd and third coat, and be|tween
this and the fourth coat, and perhaps further, other le&s;s
and le&s;s bulbs are vi&s;ible, all adjoining to the caudex at the bot|tom
of the mother bulb; and which I am told, require as many
years, before they will flower, as the number of the coats with
which they are covered; and that the &s;ame different &s;tates of
maturity probably obtain in the buds round the &s;hoots of many
fruit-trees, the central one of which will produce flowers the
next year as on the &s;purs of apple-trees; while tho&s;e beneath
it require more or fewer years, before they become &s;ufficiently
mature to produce organs of &s;exual generation; an important
&s;ecret in the management of fruit-trees.</P>
<P>The hyacinth-root differs from the tulip-root; for, as I am
informed, the &s;tem of the la&s;t year's flower is always found in
the center of the root, as in the onions above de&s;cribed; and
that the new off-&s;ets ari&s;e from the caudex below this bulb, and
not between any of the concentric coats of it, except the two
external ones. On this account the central part is liable by
its decay to de&s;troy the flower-bud, if not taken out of the earth,
when the leaves die; and hence &s;ome flori&s;ts believe, that the&s;e
roots peri&s;h naturally in five or &s;even years, after they have
flowered, but that the tulip-root never dies from age.</P>
<P>In a few roots of hyacinths, which I this day examined, Sep|tember
1, the &s;tem of one, which had apparently flowered in
the &s;ummer, was perfectly decayed in the center of many new
bulbs. In another bulb of le&s;s &s;ize and compa&s;s, which I &s;up|po&s;ed
had not borne a flower, I found a central flower-bud in|clo&s;ed
in many concentric fle&s;hy ba&s;es of former leaves, like an
onion in the autumn, which had been &s;own in the preceding
&s;pring. And concluded from hence, that the hyacinth-root
dies annually or biennially like the onion, leaving behind it a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of leaf-bulbs or of flower bulbs.</P>
<P>The caudex and claw-like roots of the ranunculus cultivated
by flori&s;ts dies I believe annually, after having put forth a circle
of new claws from the upper part of it round the bottom of the
peri&s;hing flower-&s;tem. Hence the claws of the old root, which
became &s;hrivelled, as the flower advanced, in the autumn di&s;ap|pear;
and the decayed part of the old caudex is &s;een beneath
<PB N="155" REF="161">
the new claw-like roots, which I &s;uppo&s;e has given occasion to
&s;ome inaccurate ob&s;ervers to believe, that the old stem in this
and &s;ome other perennial herbaceous plants was drawn down|wards
by the new root-fibres; while the bulbs of the iris have
been &s;uppo&s;ed to have been pu&s;hed upwards, like the lamb-like
barometz, by the re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;oil to the elongation of the
root-fibres; which la&s;t seems to be a much more probable idea
than the former.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations it appears, that the concentric leaves,
which incircle the &s;tems of bulb-rooted plants, are the lungs to
the caudex, as one or more leaves are to the bud of a tree; and
that the caudex with the&s;e leaves, and the root-fibres, con&s;t|itute
a vegetable being; which produces a viviparous progeny of new
leaf-bulbs, or a &s;eminiferous progeny in flower-bulbs, with
a magazine of nutriment in the fle&s;hy ba&s;e of each leaf; and that
the tulip produces only leaf-bulbs for four or five years from the &s;eed,
and then but one flower-bulb with many leaf-bulbs annually.
But that the onion-kind, allium, generates two or three
flower-bulbs in the fir&s;t &s;ummer from the &s;eed; which produce
flowers and other leaf-bulbs in the &s;econd &s;ummer from the &s;eed.
And la&s;tly, that it is probable, that all bulbous roots, like the
buds of deciduous trees, and perhaps of evergreen ones al&s;o, are
properly &s;peaking biennial plants, as they ri&s;e in one &s;ummer
and peri&s;h in the next.</P>
<P>3. In tulip-roots, which have been planted too deep in the
earth, and in onion-roots, a vegetable cord, or proce&s;s, is &s;ome|times
&s;een about an inch long to ari&s;e from the caudex beneath the ba&s;es
of the cylindrical leaves, and to form a new bulb.
Similar to this appears the natural growth of the roots of potatoes;
a &s;permatic cord ari&s;es from the old root, after the leaves
are expanded in the air, to oxygenate the vegetable blood, and
a new tuberous or bulbous root is thus generated.</P>
<P>This mode of producing di&s;tant roots is exactly re&s;embled
above ground by the wires of &s;trawberries; which may be called
&s;permatic cords, which depo&s;it a new vegetable being on the
earth, and support it like a bud on a tree, till it can &s;trike roots
into the &s;oil, and elevate leaves into the air. The final cau&s;e of
the length of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous and aerial &s;permatic cords is
<PB N="156" REF="162">
evidently the de&s;ign of placing their roots at a convenient di&s;tance
from their parent plants; that they may not incommode each
other, but may both of them more readily acquire nutritious
juices from the earth, and the ventilation and &s;un&s;hine of the
atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>The&s;e embryon vegetables in the various bulbous and tuberous
roots are in very different &s;tates of maturity, as in the buds of
different trees; thus in the potatoe the corculum or plumula of
the new plant only is vi&s;ible, &s;urrounded with a farinaceous nu|triment,
as in many &s;eeds; whereas in the tulip and hyacinth the flower of
the &s;ucceeding year is di&s;cernible, as in the bud of
the hor&s;e-che&s;nut.</P>
<P>As the ripening of the &s;eed of &s;ome bulbous-rooted plants
is forwarded by de&s;troying the new bulbs, as in orchis; and the
flowering bulbs of other plants are made &s;tronger by rai&s;ing them
out of the earth, and taking away the leaf-bulbs, which &s;urround
them on the &s;ame caudex; as in the cu&s;tomary management of
tulip-roots, and hyacinth-roots by the flori&s;ts; I was led to
&s;u&s;pect, that pinching off the flowers of potatoes two or three
times might increa&s;e the &s;ize or quantity of the roots; as the
nouri&s;hment derived from the vegetable blood to the flowers and
&s;eeds might thus be directed to enlarge the roots, and thus lay
up more nutriment for the future plants. This idea I mentioned
to an ingenious Lady, who acquainted me a few months after|wards,
that on a few roots she had made this experiment with
apparent advantage.</P>
<P>4. The bulbous and tuberous roots of plants are a lateral or
paternal progeny like the buds of trees, and therefore exactly
re&s;emble the parent plant, as mentioned in Sect. III. 2. 1. and
on this account may be liable to be affected by hereditary
di&s;ea&s;es, and thus to become unhealthy; whence the canker is
&s;uppo&s;ed to arise in tho&s;e apple-trees, which have for a century
or two been propagated by grafting; and the curled leaf in
potatoes, which have been too long propagated by their bulbs;
and the barrenne&s;s of hautbois &s;trawberries, which have too
long been propagated by wires; all which di&s;ea&s;es are believed
not to happen in the&s;e plants, if they have recently been rai&s;ed
<PB N="157" REF="163">
from &s;eed, but want further ob&s;ervations to authenticate the
facts.</P>
<P>But there exi&s;ts a &s;et of bulbs, which &s;eem to be formed by
amatorial or &s;eminal generation, and not by the lateral or pater|nal
generation, and would therefore &s;eem to be a viviparous
&s;exual progeny. The&s;e are produced on the flower-&s;tem in the
place of &s;eeds; and in proce&s;s of time fall off, and take root in
the earth, as is agreeably &s;een in the polygonum viviparum, vivi|parous
bi&s;tort, and the magical onion, allium magicum, and the
leeke allium &s;ativum. A curious que&s;tion here occurs, whether
the plants from the&s;e bulbs are liable exactly to re&s;emble their
parents? and whether they would be liable to hereditary di&s;ea&s;es
from a long cultivation of them in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as is &s;uppo&s;ed to
happen to tho&s;e mentioned above?</P>
<P>Though a perfect flower precedes the product of &s;ome &s;um|mit-bulbs,
as I believe in the lower part of the &s;pike of the
polygonum viviparum; yet I &s;u&s;pect, that the &s;ummit-bulbs of
allium magicum, are exactly &s;imilar to the bulbs, which are
produced at their roots; becau&s;e on cutting one of them
horizontally into two hemi&s;pheres this morning, September 10,
ob&s;erved three young bulbs inclo&s;ed in the concentric fle&s;hy
membranes of the &s;ummit-bulb in the following manner; five
thick fle&s;hy concentric coats of the general &s;ummit-bulb being
taken away, there appeared one &s;ingle naked &s;mall bulb; and
one the &s;ixth coat being removed, two other bulbs became vi&s;i|ble,
which were included in it. Whence it &s;eems, that the&s;e
&s;tem-bulbs are as forward as tho&s;e of the root, and probably are
in every re&s;pect &s;imilar; and that the bractes or floral-leaves,
which in &s;eed-bearing plants &s;ecrete or prepare a nouri&s;hment for
the &s;eed, and pericarp of the flower, acquire in the&s;e bulbiferous
onions and leeks a new office, and prepare a magazine of nourishment
in the concentric membranes, which &s;urround their &s;ummit-bulbs;
and the&s;e may be e&s;teemed therefore a &s;exual
viviparous progeny of vegetables, as buds are a lateral viviparous
progeny.</P>
<P>5. The roots of trees &s;o re&s;emble their branches, that &s;ubterra|neous
buds are frequently produced upon them, which re&s;emble
the parent-tree. The bark of the root likewi&s;e &s;o re&s;embles the
<PB N="158" REF="164">
bark of the branches, that it is not uncommon to ingraft with
&s;ucce&s;s on roots taken out of the earth and replanted; as the
robinia on the root of the acacia, and any other apples on the
roots or the &s;uckers of bur-apples or of codlings; which may be
done earlier in the vernal months, as being le&s;s liable to injury
from fro&s;ty nights; and it is probable, that budding or inocu|lating
may be performed in the &s;ame manner on the roots at
mid&s;ummer, as on the branches.</P>
<P>The roots of tho&s;e plants, which are otherwi&s;e not ea&s;ily
propagated, will &s;hoot up buds, if a part of them next to the
plant be half cut through, or rai&s;ed out of the ground, and ex|po&s;ed
to the air; as in pyramidal campanula and geranium
lobatum; and after a time the root may be &s;eparated from the
&s;tock, and many new plants may be this way produced.</P>
<P>The&s;e root-buds, or &s;uckers, are generally produced near the
trunk of the tree, before the root de&s;cends much beneath the
&s;oil; but in &s;ome trees, as the elm, ulmus. and acer, maple,
who&s;e roots &s;pread far horizontally, and near the &s;urface of the
earth, they are generated at a great di&s;tance from the parent
tree; becau&s;e the new &s;cion can thus &s;oon acquire the influence
of the atmo&s;phere on its expanding foliage. The&s;e root-&s;cions
from apple-trees are frequently u&s;ed in vegetable nur&s;eries for the
purpo&s;e of ingrafting upon, and are termed paradi&s;e-&s;tocks by
&s;ome gardeners; but are not liable to the canker like the grafts
from those old apple-trees, which have been in fa&s;hion above
a century; as the&s;e root-&s;cions re&s;emble the trunk of the tree,
which produces them, not the ingrafted head of it; and thus
may not have been many years from the &s;tate of a &s;eedling ve|getable.</P>
<P>Similar to the&s;e root-&s;cions of trees it is probable, that the
root-buds of perennial herbaceous plants are produced; which
have divaricated, or fibrous-roots, and who&s;e &s;ummits peri&s;h in
the winter. For many years the root thickens by an annual
new bark being induced over the old one, exactly as in the trunks
and roots of trees.</P>
<P>As the&s;e roots increa&s;e in &s;ize, the central part, I &s;uppo&s;e,
changes like the internal wood of a tree, and cea&s;es to po&s;&s;e&s;s
vegetable life; and in proce&s;s as time is liable to decay. On
<PB N="159" REF="165">
this account the&s;e perennial roots are not &s;o valuable for the pur|po&s;es
of medicine or diet, or mechanic arts, either before or after
they have pa&s;&s;ed a determinate age; as the bark of the root
changes annually into a kind of alburnum, and then into a kind
of wood, and la&s;tly, is liable to decay, as occurs in the roots of
rheum palmatum, when they are &s;even or more years old. See
Sect. XVII. 2. 1. This decay of the central part of the root,
which happens annually to &s;ome plants, and is &s;urrounded with
new buds and their root-fibres, exhibits the appearance of the
lower end of the root having been chopped, or bitten off, to &s;ome
fanciful botani&s;ts; as in plantago major, and valerian; and has
hence given to &s;cabio&s;a &s;ucci&s;a the name of devil's-bit, mor&s;us
diaboli.</P>
<P>6. The bulbs already mentioned, as tho&s;e of tulips, hyacinths,
and onions, are properly the winter-cradles, or hybernacula, of
the young plants, whether in their leaf-bulb or flower-bulb &s;tate;
and are furni&s;hed with a magazine or re&s;ervoir of nouri&s;hment
for the growing embryons, as appears in the &s;quil, &s;cilla maritima,
which vegetates from this &s;ource of nutriment in the druggi&s;ts
&s;hops. But there are other roots termed tuberous roots, as of
turnep and carrot, which con&s;i&s;t &s;olely of a large re&s;ervoir of nu|triment
for the growth and nouri&s;hment of the ri&s;ing &s;tem and fu|ure
&s;eeds; whether the&s;e are produced in the &s;ame year, as oc|curs,
when the &s;eeds are &s;own early in the &s;pring; or when their
vegetation is &s;topped by the cold of winter, and proceeds again
in the en&s;uing &s;pring; as generally occurs to our turneps, the
roots of which I am well informed may be much enlarged by
tran&s;plantation. See Sect. XII. 6.</P>
<P>In the&s;e plants the leaves, by expo&s;ing the vegetable blood to
the influence of the air, prepare it for the &s;ecretion of nutriment
in their knobby roots; in the &s;ame manner as nouri&s;hment is pro|duced
and re&s;erved in the concentric fle&s;hy ba&s;es of the leaves of
onions; and in the&s;e plants, as in the onion kind, the leaves,
which &s;urround the ba&s;e of the new &s;tems, wither and die; as
the new buds, or bulbs put forth leaves of their own for the pur|po&s;e
of oxygenating their blood. Thus it appears, that the
&s;tem and flower of the onion, or carrot, or turnep, is a new plant,
not ari&s;ing immediately from the &s;eed which was &s;own, but from
<PB N="160" REF="166">
the leaf-root or leaf-knob, if it may be &s;o called, which pre|ceded
the production of the flower-bud, or flower-&s;tem, exactly
as the flower or ear of wheat, which was &s;hewn in Sect. IX. 3. 1.
to have three or four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive leaf-buds preceding the flower-bud.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations may we conclude, that no flower-bud
or flower-bulb is ever produced from a &s;eed, without the pre|vious
interpo&s;ition of one or more leaf-buds or leaf-bulbs? and
that tho&s;e flower-buds or flower-bulbs are either produced in one
generation after &s;owing the &s;eed, as the flower-bulbs of onions,
which are generated and nouri&s;hed at the ba&s;es of the concentric
cylindrical leaves of the preceding leaf-plant, which aro&s;e from the &s;eed;
or as the &s;tems and flower-buds of the carrot and
turnep, which are generated and nouri&s;hed at the ba&s;e of the
concentric leaves of the preceding leaf-plant. Or &s;econdly,
that they are produced in one &s;ummer, though after &s;everal ge|nerations
from the &s;eed; as the three or four joints of the &s;tem
of wheat, and other gra&s;&s;es, which are generated and nouri&s;hed
in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the bo&s;oms of four or five cylindrical leaves, one
at each joint; which al&s;o probably obtains in all other vegetables,
which are &s;upported by hollow &s;tems divided by joints, and fur|ni&s;hed
with leaves at the&s;e &s;tem-joints with or without branches,
as tragopogon or picris. In the&s;e plants, where there are no
branches, there is &s;imply a new central bud; and two or more
lateral new buds be&s;ide the central one, where there are
branches.</P>
<P>Or la&s;tly, where the leaf-buds or leaf-bulbs, which are pro|duced
from &s;eeds, &s;ucceed each other for &s;ome years, before they
arrive at &s;ufficient maturity to produce &s;exual organs, or gene|rate
a flower, as in the bulbs of tulips, and hyacinths, and the
buds of trees. Whence we at length acquire a di&s;tinct idea,
why &s;eedling apple-trees are ten or twelve years before they bear fruit;
though the buds or &s;hoots taken from a tree, which already
has born fruit, and ingrafted even on a young &s;eedling-tree,
&s;hall produce flowers in the first or &s;econd year; as the&s;e buds have
already acquired that &s;tate of perfection or maturity, which
is nece&s;&s;ary to the production of &s;exual or &s;eminal generation:
and as it therefore po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the age of puberty, or the maturity
<PB N="161" REF="167">
of the tree; we may &s;u&s;pect, that it will &s;ooner acquire the here|ditary
di&s;ea&s;es con&s;equent to too long unmixed &s;ucce&s;&s;ive genera|tions,
a piece of very important knowledge to the planters of
orchards; which they owe to the ob&s;ervation of Mr. Knight, as
mentioned in Sect. VII. 1. 3.</P>
<P>Hence in many plants produced from &s;eeds, perhaps in all,
one or more leaf-buds precede the flower bud; and I &s;uppo&s;e
generally, if not always, a magazine of aliment is formed at
the ba&s;es of the leaves, or in the roots, for the nutriment of
the &s;ucceeding leaf-bud or flower-bud of which it is the parent.</P>
<P>Thus in the carrot and turnep the fir&s;t leaves con&s;titute the
lungs of the new vegetable being, which generates the &s;ucceeding
flower-&s;tem, and &s;ecretes or depo&s;its for it a magazine of ali|ment,
which forms the tuberous root: and then this fir&s;t plant
from the &s;eed and its leaves or lungs peri&s;h; arid the root gra|dually
&s;hrivels up, as it is ab&s;orbed by the new flower-&s;tem. In
many plants the&s;e fir&s;t or root-leaves differ in form from tho&s;e of
the &s;ucceeding &s;tem, as in palmated rhubarb, and in campanula
rotundifolia, which is &s;o called from the round form of the leaves
of this first leaf-bud, or root-plant, which precedes the flower-stem.</P>
<P>7. One great advantage of Mr. Tull's hor&s;e-hoeing hu&s;bandry,
in which the earth near the rows of wheat is alternately turned
from and to them during the vernal months, has been &s;uppo&s;ed
to ari&s;e from some fibres of the roots being thus cut off, and new
&s;tems &s;hooting up at the ends of tho&s;e which remain; but the
real cau&s;e of the production of the new &s;tems is from the accu|mulation
of earth above the fir&s;t joint of the young wheat-plant;
from which the new buds &s;pring out, generated and nouri&s;hed by
the caudex of the leaf, which &s;urrounds that joint, and which af|terwards
withers; this important circum&s;tance is &s;hewn by the
annexed delineation of a tran&s;planted wheat-plant.</P>
<P>The plant of wheat was taken from a corn-field in the &s;pring,
and then con&s;i&s;ted fir&s;t of the root immediately proceeding from
the &s;eed <HI>a,</HI> which has been called the &s;eminal root; and &s;econdly,
of the root, which was then near the &s;urface of the ground <HI>b,</HI>
which has been called the coronal root, was furni&s;hed with <HI>a</HI>
&s;tem and leaf, <HI>c, d,</HI> and with a &s;econdary &s;tem, or root-&s;cion,

<HI>e, f.</HI> This wheat-plant con&s;i&s;ting of only two &s;tems was re|planted
in my garden, and purpo&s;ely buried &s;o deep as to cover
the two or three fir&s;t joints of both the &s;tems beneath the &s;oil;
that is as high as the letter <HI>f,</HI> where the &s;econdary &s;tem was
purpo&s;ely cut off.</P>
<P>On taking up this plant with &s;ome others on September 24,
it had a&s;&s;umed the form here delineated. The primary &s;tem,
<HI>c, g,</HI> had &s;hot out no new roots from the joint <HI>g,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e
to have happened from its being too far advanced when re|planted;
as many other &s;tems of other wheat-plants, which had
not been obtruncated, had neverthele&s;s put forth one or more
lateral &s;tems or root-&s;cions at the &s;econd or third joints, which
on tran&s;plantation had been covered with the &s;oil.</P>
<P>But the obtruncated &s;tem, <HI>e, f,</HI> had generated a new root-&s;cion
at <HI>h,</HI> like the first &s;hoot from the &s;eed at <HI>a;</HI> which had pro|duced
other new &s;tems as it approached nearer the &s;urface of the
earth at <HI>i;</HI> and as the&s;e advanced into the air, and formed their
leaves, other new root-&s;cions were generated at <HI>k</HI> and <HI>l.</HI>
Whence it appears, that by decapitation, and a deeper immer|&s;ion
in the ground, a &s;econdary &s;tem in this plant became mul|tiplied
into five; all which produced perfect ears of corn; and
in other roots, which I had planted in a similar manner, the
increa&s;e was much greater: and e&s;pecially where one or more
of the primary or &s;econdary &s;tems had been decapitated.</P>
<P>If a grain of wheat be dropped on the &s;urface of the earth,
and &s;uffered to &s;hoot down its roots, and to rai&s;e its &s;tem, which
is the proce&s;s of nature, I &s;uppo&s;e but one &s;tem would be pro|duced;
as the fir&s;t knot or joint of it would not be covered with
earth, and could not therefore &s;hoot down new roots; which are
necessary in the&s;e plants to the production of new &s;tems which are
not branches but &s;uckers or root-&s;cions.</P>
<P>But if the grain be buried an inch deep in the earth, a &s;hoot
ri&s;es from the roots, which i&s;&s;ue from the &s;eed, which is an
elongation of the caudex, and puts forth a leaf in contact with
the &s;urface of the earth; this leaf and &s;tem con&s;titute the pri|mary
plant and generate new buds, which put forth new roots
de&s;cending into the earth; and thus three or four or more &s;uck|ers,
or new plants, ari&s;e round the original one, which was con|tained
in the &s;eed: hence the appearance of two roots, which
<PB N="163" REF="169">
&s;ome authors have named the &s;eminal and coronal roots. The
ingenious Mr. Tull &s;eems himself to have been aware of this cir|cum&s;tance,
as he &s;ays in his Hu&s;bandry, &startq;Late planted wheat
&s;ends out no root above the grain before &s;pring, but is nouri&s;hed
all winter by a &s;ingle thread proceeding from the grain up to the
&s;urface.&endq;</P>
<P>This explains the prodigious multiplication of the &s;tems of
wheat, which may be produced by tran&s;planting it three or four
times in the &s;ummer, autumn, and en&s;uing &s;pring; for if it be
&s;o managed, that a &s;econd joint of each young &s;tem be buried
in the &s;oil, or brought even into contact with it, &s;o that new
roots may &s;trike down into the earth; the caudex of the leaf,
which &s;urrounds this joint will generate many new buds, which
will thus become &s;uckers, or root &s;cions, and rival their parent;
and may be again tran&s;planted or earthed up three or four times
with wonderful increa&s;e. Mr. Charles Miller of Cambridge
&s;owed &s;ome wheat on the &s;econd of June 1766, and on the
eighth of August one plant was taken up and &s;eparated into
eighteen parts and replanted; the&s;e plants were again taken up
and divided between the middle of September and the middle of
October, and again planted &s;eparately to &s;tand the winter, and
this &s;econd divi&s;ion produced &s;ixty-&s;even plants. They were
again taken up, and divided between the middle of March and
the middle of April, and produced five hundred plants. The
number of ears thus produced from one grain of wheat was
21109, which mea&s;ured three pecks and three quarters of corn,
weighed forty-&s;even pounds &s;even ounces, and were e&s;timated at
576840 grains! Philo&s;. Tran&s;. Vol. LVIII. p. 203. See Sect.
XII. 6.</P>
<P>Nor is this un&s;upported by the analogy of other vegetables,
in which new roots are liable to &s;hoot in great abundance from
their joints either alone or along with new buds, if a proper de|gree
of moi&s;ture is pre&s;ented to them. Thus if the &s;tem of a
potatoe be laid down upon the earth, and covered with &s;oil over
the fir&s;t joint, a new &s;eries of roots will be protruded from that
joint; and afterwards another &s;eries of roots from the &s;econd
joint, if managed in the &s;ame manner; and it is a&s;&s;erted that
this will occur even if the potatoe &s;tems are taken out of the
<PB N="164" REF="170">
ground, when they are &s;ix or eight inches high, and deprived of
all their young roots, and tran&s;planted, &s;o as to cover one or
two joints, and that a great crop has been thus produced.</P>
<P>The rapid growth of &s;ome gra&s;&s;es, and of &s;ome &s;pecies of the
convolvulus, and of colt's-foot, is well known, and very trou|ble&s;ome
in many &s;ituations. Of the&s;e very minute parts of the
jointed root, when cut from the parent, elongate them&s;elves,
and &s;hoot up new plants. From the very numerous divi&s;ions of
the wheat-root de&s;cribed by Mr. Miller, it may be &s;u&s;pected that
&s;omething &s;imilar to this mu&s;t have happened, which further
ob&s;ervations mu&s;t determine.</P>
<P>Vines al&s;o are thus liable to &s;hoot out roots at their joints, and
fig-trees when covered only with a &s;hred of cloth in nailing
them to a wall, if it be accidentally kept moi&s;t. And there is
an apple-tree, which is called a burr-apple, becau&s;e it puts out
roundi&s;h protuberances or excre&s;cences of the bark like a burr,
which if the branch be bent down, or even torn off, and &s;et in the
moi&s;t earth, will immediately &s;trike out roots, as I am told,
and become a tree &s;imilar to the parent.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner I have been informed that if a circular
ring of the bark be cut off from many trees and &s;hrubs, which
are otherwi&s;e difficult to propagate, and earth be put round the branch thus decorticated a few inches above and below the
wounded part, by means of a garden-pot previou&s;ly broken lon|gitudinally,
and bound together round the branch, that roots
will &s;hoot from the upper lip of the wound; and in a little time
the branch may be &s;afely cut off below the garden-pot, and plant|ed
with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>When a few inches of the end of a branch are cut off in the
&s;pring, as is common in pruning wall-trees, new buds are pro|duced
near the extremity, which remains; or tho&s;e, which did
exi&s;t, grow with greater vigour; as they obtain &s;ome of that
nouri&s;hment, which &s;hould have &s;upported the buds, which
were cut off. The &s;ame occurs in re&s;pect to the &s;uckers or
root-&s;cions of tho&s;e trees, which produce them, as of elm-trees,
and of &s;ome apple-trees; if many of the branches be cut away,
the &s;uckers or root-&s;cions become more numerous, or more vigorous.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="171">
This explains the u&s;e of a practice among many farmers of
eating down a forward crop of wheat in the &s;pring with &s;heep.
In this ca&s;e the central or upright &s;tem of the wheat is decapi|tated,
and many lateral ones, or root-&s;cions, as above de&s;crib|ed,
become generated, or grow with greater vigour; acquiring
additional nouri&s;hment from the joint, which was to have been
expended in the growth of the central &s;tem; and which appears
so di&s;tinctly in the preceding figure of a tran&s;planted wheat-plant,
which neverthele&s;s in crops, which are not too forward, may
be very injurious, as spoken of in Sect. XVI. 2. 3.</P>
<P>Thus the figure above alluded to explains four important cir|cum&s;tances
in the cultivation of grains, that of earthing up the
rows in spring by Mr. Tull's hor&s;e-hoe; that of eating down
the fir&s;t &s;tems of forward crops by &s;heep; that of tran&s;planting
the roots deeper in the &s;oil; and that of &s;owing the &s;eed an
inch or two beneath the &s;urface. For an account of the drill

<P><PB N="169" REF="175">
I. 1. The various &s;ub&s;tances, which con&s;titute animal bodies,
or which are found in the cavities of them, are compo&s;ed from
&s;impler elements by the proce&s;&s;es of dige&s;tion, and &s;anguification,
and &s;ccretion; for it is well known, that even milk, which &s;o
much re&s;embles the chyle of animals, is not ab&s;orbed by the
lacteals without its being previou&s;ly coagulated, and again di&s;|&s;olved
in the &s;tomach by the power of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Hence it happens, that the chyle of all animals, and from
every kind of food which they take into their &s;tomachs, is very
&s;imilar; and like milk con&s;i&s;ts of water, &s;ugar, mucilage, and
oil; the la&s;t of which not being &s;oluble in water, but only mi&s;|cible
with it, gives it its opaque white colour.</P>
<P>But though the chyle from different kinds of aliment is &s;o
&s;imilar, and all the various con&s;tituent parts of animal bodies are
ultimately produced from the chyle by &s;anguification and &s;ecre|tion,
yet it happens, that &s;ome kinds of aliment po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater
quantity of the&s;e particles, which make chyle, than other kinds
of aliment. Such materials for in&s;tance as already contain much
&s;ugar, mucilage, and oil, as the fle&s;h of dead animals, or the
fruits and &s;eeds of vegetables.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the water, &s;ugar, mucilage, and oil, which exi&s;t in
chyle, there may be other materials, which are invi&s;ible from
their perfect &s;olution in water, either alone or when converted
into acids by the addition of oxygen; as carbon, pho&s;phorus,
calcareous earth, marine and ammoniacal &s;alts; though it is
more probable, that the two la&s;t are formed and &s;ecreted by
animal proce&s;&s;es, as well as &s;elected by their ab&s;orbent roots, as
they are more compounded bodies than the former.</P>
<P>Similar to this chyle of animals the &s;ap-juice, which is ab|&s;orbed
from the earth by the roots of plants, con&s;titutes their
nouri&s;hment, and con&s;i&s;ts of water, &s;ugar, and mucilage, with
other tran&s;parent &s;olutions, as of carbon, pho&s;phorus, and cal|careous
earth. And though it has been proved by the experi|ments
of &s;ome philo&s;ophers, that vegetables can extract or com|po&s;e
all the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances from air and water alone; yet &s;ome ma|terials
contribute more to the production of this vegetable-chyle
or &s;ap-juice than others, &s;uch as the recrements of dead vegeta|ble
and animal &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="176">
2. If any one &s;hould a&s;k, what is the food of animals? I
&s;hould an&s;wer, that in the mo&s;t early &s;tate of animal life the em|bryon
lives on a mucilaginous fluid, with which it is &s;urrounded,
whether in the egg or womb; that in its infant &s;tate the young
animal is &s;u&s;tained by milk, which its &s;tomach converts into
chyle.</P>
<P>In their adult &s;tate animals are &s;u&s;tained by other vegetable or
animal &s;ub&s;tances taken into their &s;tomachs, which are there
converted into chyle partly by a chemical, and partly by an ani|mal
proce&s;s; as by a mixture of ga&s;tric juice with water and
heat, &s;ome of the&s;e recrements of organic nature are decom|po&s;ed,
either into their &s;impler component parts, or &s;ometimes
even into their elements; while other parts of them are only
rendered &s;oluble or mi&s;cible with water; and are then drank up
by the ab&s;orbents of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>In this proce&s;s of dige&s;tion much &s;ugar is produced, which is
probably immediately &s;elected and drank up by the numerous
months of the lacteals, or lymphatics; to which it is pre&s;ented
by the vermicular or peri&s;taltic motions of the &s;tomach and in|te&s;tines.
And as this ready &s;election and ab&s;orption of the &s;ugar,
as &s;oon as it is formed, prevents it from pa&s;&s;ing into the vinous
or acetous fermentation; it is probable that from the want of
&s;uch a means of &s;eparating &s;accharine matter, as &s;oon as it is
formed, chemi&s;try has not yet been able to produce &s;ugar from
its elements without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of animal dige&s;tion, or vege|table
germination; as further &s;poken of in No. 8. 1. of this &s;ection.</P>
<P>In this proce&s;s of dige&s;tion, I believe, a great part of the
water, &s;ugar, mucilage, and oil, which exi&s;t in vegetable and
animal recrements, are not decompo&s;ed into their elements, but
ab&s;orbed by being &s;oluble or mi&s;cible with water; the carbon,
and the pho&s;pborus and the hydrogen, are al&s;o I &s;uppo&s;e di&s;&s;olved
in the other fluids by means of oxygen, and form a part of the
chyle, without their being converted into ga&s;&s;es; for when this
happens to any exce&s;s in re&s;pect to carbon, it e&s;capes from the
&s;tomach in eructations; and the &s;ame occurs to the inflammable
air or hydrogen, if a part of the water becomes decompo&s;ed in
the inte&s;tines, which if it be not ab&s;orbed by its &s;olution in other
<PB N="171" REF="177">
fluids, but acquires a ga&s;&s;eous &s;tate, is liable to e&s;cape below;
though both the&s;e ga&s;&s;es &s;eem occa&s;ionally to revert to a fluid
&s;tate from their aerial one in the &s;tomach or inte&s;tines, and to
be then ab&s;orbable by the lacteals or lymphatics.</P>
<P>3. What then is the food of vegetables? the embryon plant
in the &s;eed or fruit is &s;urrounded with &s;accharine, mucilaginous
and oily materials, like the animal fetus in the egg or uterus,
which it ab&s;orbs, and converts it into nutriment; while the em|bryon
buds of deciduous trees, which is another infantine &s;tate
of vegetables, are &s;upplied with a &s;accharine and mucilaginous
juice prepared for them at the time of their production, and de|po&s;ited
in the roots or &s;ap-wood, of their parent-trees; as in the
vine, maple, and birch; which &s;accharine matter is &s;oluble and
mi&s;cible with the water of the &s;urrounding earth in the &s;ubse|quent
&s;pring, and is forcibly ab&s;orbed by their root-ve&s;&s;els, and
expands their na&s;cent foliage.</P>
<P>In their infantine &s;tate therefore there is a wonderful analogy
between plants and animals; and it is particularly curious to ob|&s;erve
in the proce&s;s of converting barley into malt by the germi|nation
of the &s;eed, that the meal of the barley is in part con|verted
into &s;ugar by the dige&s;tion of the young plant exactly as
in the animal &s;tomach. The wonderful effect of vegetable di|ge&s;tion
in producing &s;ugar may be deduced from the great pro|duct
of the &s;ugar-cane, and of the maple-tree in America, men|tioned
in Sect. III. 2. 3. and the wonderful effect of animal
dige&s;tion in producing &s;ugar appears in patients, who labour
under diabetes. A man in the infirmary of Stafford, who
drank daily an immoderate quantity of beer, and who eat above
twice the quantity of food that tho&s;e in health con&s;ume, voided
&s;ixteen or eighteen pounds of water daily, from each pound of
which above an ounce of coar&s;e &s;ugar was extracted by evapo|ration.

<P>4. We now come to con&s;ider the food of adult plants; and
in this con&s;i&s;ts the great and e&s;&s;ential difference between the nu|tritive
proce&s;&s;es of animals and vegetables. The former are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of a &s;tomach, by which they can in a few hours decom|po&s;e
the tender parts of vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances by a
chemical proce&s;s within them&s;elves, conducted in the heat of
<PB N="172" REF="178">
ninety-eight degrees, with a due quantity of water, and a per|petual
agitation of the ingredients; which both mixes them,
and applies them to the mouths of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which
&s;urround them. Whereas a vegetable being having no &s;tomach
is nece&s;&s;itated to wait for the &s;pontaneous decompo&s;ition of
animal or vegetable recrements; which is indeed continually going
on in tho&s;e &s;oil&s;, and climates, and in tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of the
year, which are mo&s;t friendly to vegetation; but is in other &s;itu|ations,
and in other &s;ea&s;ons, a &s;low proce&s;s in a degree of heat
often as low as forty of Farenheit, (in which the reindeer
mo&s;s, mo&s;chus, rangiferinus, vegetates beneath the &s;now in Siberia,)
and often without an adapted quantity of water to give a due
fluidity, or any mechanical locomotion to pre&s;ent them to the
ab&s;orbent mouths of their roots; or in &s;till wor&s;e &s;ituations
adult vegetables are nece&s;&s;itated &s;till more &s;lowly to acquire or
produce their nutritive juices from the &s;impler elements of air and
water, with perhaps the &s;olutions of carbonic acid and calcareous
earth, and perhaps of &s;ome other matters, with which one or
more of them abound.</P>
<P>But M. Ha&s;&s;enfratz found, that the vegetation of tho&s;e plants
was imperfect, which had not been &s;uffered to grow in contact
with the earth; as they never arrived at &s;uch maturity as to pro|duce
fruit; and were found on analy&s;is to contain a le&s;s portion
of carbon, than other plants of the &s;ame kind. The experi|ments
were tried on hyacinths, kidney-beans, and cre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Hence the other great difference, which exi&s;ts between the&s;e
two exten&s;ive kingdoms of nature, is, that the larger and
warmer blooded animals certainly, and I &s;uppo&s;e all the tribes of
in&s;ects, and of colder blooded creatures al&s;o, can not exi&s;t long
on air and water alone, except in their &s;tate of hibernal torpor.
The neare&s;t approach to this is however &s;een in &s;ome fevers,
where water alone has been taken for a week or two, and yet the
patient has recovered; and there is a well atte&s;ted account of a
numerous caravan, which having lo&s;t their rout, or their provi|&s;ions,
are affirmed to have lived &s;ome weeks on gum arabic and
water alone.</P>
<P>Vegetables on the contrary, as above mentioned, can exi&s;t,
though in a feebler &s;tate, on water and air alone, with the car|bonic
<PB N="173" REF="179">
acid, and perhaps other invi&s;ible &s;olvends, which tho&s;e ele|ments
unavoidably contain. This I &s;uppo&s;e to be owing to the
low degree of heat, which they produce internally, and to the
&s;low circulation of their blood; from both which circum&s;tances
le&s;s nutriment is expended, as by animals which &s;leep in winter.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying adult vegetables with nouri&s;h|ment,
we &s;hould fir&s;t con&s;ider what kinds of matter are mo&s;t pre|valent
or mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in their compo&s;ition. Secondly, what
of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances they can ab&s;orb without previou&s; decompo&s;i|tion.
La&s;tly, how to expedite the decompo&s;ition of vegetable
and animal &s;ub&s;tances on or in the &s;oil, like the dige&s;tive pro|ce&s;&s;es
in the &s;tomachs of animals; we may thus become ac|quainted
with the &s;ources and the management of manures.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>II. AIR.</HEAD>
<P>1. Oxygen combined with heat con&s;titutes that part of the at|mo&s;phere,
which is perpetually nece&s;&s;ary to animal and vegetable
re&s;piration; and a greater part of that water, which forms a
principal portion of their organization; a few words may be
therefore premi&s;ed on the&s;e mo&s;t important di&s;coveries of mo|dern
chemistry.</P>
<P>This vital air, called oxygen gas, con&s;titutes twenty-&s;even
hundredth parts of the atmo&s;phere; it is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary
to the exi&s;tence of life, and of combu&s;tion, and forms the prin|cipal
part of all acids; whence its name. The other &s;eventy-three
hundredth parts of the atmo&s;phere con&s;i&s;t of azote, which
takes its name from its inutility to life in animal re&s;piration; it
is al&s;o called nitrogen, becau&s;e it con&s;titutes the ba&s;is of nitre.</P>
<P>Oxygen gas con&s;i&s;ts of oxygen and heat; and when it unites
with &s;uch bodies, as are capable of uniting with it, the heat
is &s;et at liberty, as in re&s;piration and in combu&s;tion; in both which
proce&s;&s;es an acid is produced by the combination of oxygen with
&s;ome inflammable ba&s;e. Hence vital air con&s;i&s;ts of oxygen di&s;|&s;olved
in the fluid matter of heat; but there is al&s;o another fluid,
which &s;eems to be combined with this &s;olution of oxygen in heat,
and that is light. For when oxygen becomes combined with
charcoal or with &s;ulphur, or with pho&s;phorus, both heat or
light are &s;et at liberty from the&s;e new combinations of oxygen;
<PB N="174" REF="180">
which thus produce the carbonic, &s;ulphuric, and pho&s;phoric
acids.</P>
<P>When the&s;e new combinations of oxygen are performed very
&s;lowly, the light is &s;ometimes not vi&s;ible, as in the heating of
a dunghill; in which proce&s;s the oxygen in the cells or cavities
of the hot-bed unites &s;lowly with the carbon and pho&s;phorus of
the decompo&s;ing vegetable and animal matters; but though
much heat is given out, no light is &s;een. While on the con|trary
from rotten wood alone, or putre&s;cent fi&s;h, when expo&s;ed
to the atmo&s;phere, much light is emitted, but not much &s;en&s;ible
heat, owing perhaps &s;imply to the combu&s;tion of the pho&s;phorus,
which they contain.</P>
<P>2. The products of the&s;e combinations of oxygen with other
bodies may all of them be termed acids; though in &s;ome the
heat or light &s;et at liberty converts the&s;e acid productions into
ga&s;&s;es, as oxygen and charcoal form carbonic acid gas; and in
others it converts the new product into &s;team, which is conden|&s;ible
by cold, as the &s;ulphuric acid from the combination of
oxygen and &s;ulphur; and the pho&s;phoric acid from oxygen and
pho&s;phorus.</P>
<P>3. Other combinations of oxygen with heavier &s;ub&s;tances are
produced in the atmo&s;phere without the &s;eparation of either
&s;en&s;ible heat, or vi&s;ible light; as the union of oxygen with me|tallic
bodies, as with that of mangane&s;e, with zinc, lead, iron,
as in common ore of mangane&s;e, in lapis calaminaris, white
calciform lead-ore, and the red ochre of iron; which have not
obtained the name of acids, but are termed oxydes of tho&s;e
minerals.</P>
<P>4. Now it happens, that none of the&s;e ba&s;es, which can
combine with oxygen alone, are &s;oluble in water, and there|fore
can not be imbibed by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of vegetable
roots, until they become acids; and are perhaps then all of
them in greater or le&s;s quantities &s;oluble in water; and are
thence capable of being drank up by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of
vegetable roots, and con&s;titute a part of the food of plants.</P>
<P>5. When vegetable &s;ub&s;tances are decompo&s;ed by fermenta|tion,
there is a quick union of oxygen and carbon; and this
carbonic acid gas, called formerly fixed air, ri&s;es up in vapour,
<PB N="175" REF="181">
and flies away. But where this proce&s;s goes on more &s;lowly,
as in a dung-hill lately turned over, or in black garden mould
lately turned over, and thus expo&s;ed to the air; much of which
remains in the cells or cavities of the hotbed, or border; this
carbonic acid is &s;lowly produced, and is ab&s;orbed by vegetable
roots, I &s;uppo&s;e in its fluid &s;tate, or di&s;&s;olved in water, before
it acquires &s;o much heat as to ri&s;e in the atmo&s;phere in the form
of gas.</P>
<P>This carbonic gas in its fluid &s;tate, or di&s;&s;olved in water, not
in its aerial or ga&s;&s;eous &s;tate, is the principal food of plants;
as appears, becau&s;e their &s;olid fibres con&s;i&s;t principally of car|bon,
and their fluids of water.</P>
<P>6. Next to carbonic acid the aqueous acid, if it may be &s;o
called, or water, &s;eems to afford the principal food of vegeta|bles;
as water con&s;i&s;ts of oxygen and hydrogen, it is properly
an acid, like all other combinations of oxygen; and when ab|&s;orbed
by vegetable roots becomes in part decompo&s;ed in the
circulation or &s;ecretion of their juices; the oxygen di&s;appears,
or contributes to form the vegetable acids; and the hydrogen
produces ammonia by its union with azote; which may con|tribute
to vegetable nutriment by its mixture with oils, and thus
producing &s;oaps, which become diffu&s;able in water; and al&s;o
by decompo&s;ing in&s;oluble &s;aline earths, as gyp&s;um, or metallic
&s;alts, as vitriol of iron, and thus producing more &s;oluble or
innocuous &s;alts. And which la&s;tly forms a part of the various
vegetable productions of &s;ugar, honey, wax, re&s;in, and other
&s;ecretions.</P>
<P>7. There is a curious evolution of oxygen attends the per|&s;piration
of the leaves of plants, which is not known to attend
that of animal lungs; and that is, that when vegetable leaves
are expo&s;ed to the &s;un's light, they &s;eem to give up oxygen
gas; but in the dark they give up carbonic acid gas, like the
breath of animals. It is probable that animal lungs might do
the &s;ame, if they were expo&s;ed to the light; as perhaps might
be &s;ubjected to experiment in the gills of fi&s;h, or by breathing
through a tube into water in the &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P>In re&s;piration as well as in combu&s;tion &s;ome light may po&s;&s;ibly
be given out as well as &s;ome heat from the combination of oxy|gen,
<PB N="176" REF="182">
with &s;ome phlogi&s;tic ba&s;e, as carbon or pho&s;phorus:
whence the production of carbonic and pho&s;phoric acids in both
animal and vegetable re&s;piration. In mo&s;t animals this quantity
of light is probably too &s;mall to be perceived, if their bodies
were tran&s;parent; but in the glow-worm of this country, and
in the more luminous fire flies of the tropical climates, I &s;u&s;pect
the light to be emitted from their lungs in the act of re&s;piration,
which is a &s;low combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>8. Be&s;ides the u&s;e of oxygen in the re&s;piration of vegetables,
when applied to their leaves, as it is mixed in the atmo&s;phere;
it is believed by many to contribute much to their growth and
nouri&s;hment in its combined &s;tate, when ab&s;orbed by their roots;
and that by the decompo&s;ition of water in the vegetable &s;y&s;|em,
when the hydrogen unites with carbon and produces oil,
the oxygen becomes &s;uperfluous, and is in part exhaled, as
further &s;poken of in Sect XIII. 1. 2. Hence al&s;o &s;ome cal|ciform
ores, or metallic oxydes, as raddle, and calamine, and
burnt clay, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be u&s;eful as manures, becau&s;e they
contain much oxygen, as mentioned in No. 7. 1. of this
Section.</P>
<P>Mr. Humboldt a&s;&s;erts, that on putting cre&s;&s;es, lepidium, &s;a|tivum,
into oxygenated muriatic acid gas mixed with water,
they produced germs in &s;ix hours; while tho&s;e in common water
were thirty-&s;ix hours before they produced germs. Jacquin at
Vienna put many old &s;eeds, which had been in vain tried if
they would vegetate, into &s;uch a &s;olution of oxygenated muria|tic
acid, and found great numbers of them quickly to vegetate,
Journal de Phy&s;ique, 1798. See Sect. XIV. 2. 5.</P>
<P>In the experiments of &s;ir Francis Ford many plants, which
were &s;prinkled with water previou&s;ly impregnated with oxygen
gas, are &s;aid to have grown more vigorou&s;ly, and to have di&s;|played
more beautiful tints, than tho&s;e nouri&s;hed with common water.
Other experiments are &s;aid to have been made by in|verted
bottles filled with oxygen gas, and burying their open
mouths beneath the &s;oil near the roots of vegetables, which are
&s;aid to have grown more healthy and beautiful, as the oxygen
became ab&s;orbed, and was &s;ucceeded by air like the com|mon
atmo&s;phere. Philo&s;. Magaz. 1798, p. 224. Further ex|periments
<PB N="177" REF="183">
are required on this &s;ubject, &s;ince the fluids of vege|tables
would in general appear to be hyperoxygenated from the
oxygen emitted from the per&s;piration of their leaves in the &s;un|&s;hine,
and which is believed to ari&s;e from the decompo&s;ition of
water in their arteries or glands.</P>
<P>9. We now come to the other ingredient, which con&s;titutes
a much greater part of the atmo&s;phere than the oxygen, and
this is the azote, or nitrogen; which al&s;o &s;eems much to con|tribute
to the food or &s;u&s;tenance of vegetables; for though azote,
or nitrogen, enters into animal bodies in much greater quanti|ties
perhaps than into vegetables, &s;o as to con&s;titute according
to &s;ome chemical philo&s;ophers the principal difference between
the&s;e two great cla&s;&s;es of organized nature; yet it enters al&s;o
into the vegetable &s;y&s;tem, and is given out by their putrefaction;
and al&s;o when lime is applied to moi&s;t vegetables it di&s;engages
from them both hydrogen and azote forming volatile alkali,
as a&s;&s;erted in the ingenious work of Lord Dundonald on the
Connection of Agriculture with Chemi&s;try.</P>
<P>The azote of the atmo&s;phere, when air is confined in the in|ter&s;tices
of the &s;oil newly turned over by the plough or &s;pade
contributes to the production of the nitrous acid by its union
with the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere, with which it was before
only diffu&s;ed, or with the much greater &s;ource of oxygen from
the decompo&s;ing water of the &s;oil. At the &s;ame time another
part of the abundant azote combines with the hydrogen of the
decompo&s;ing water of the &s;oil, and produces ammonia or vola|tile
alkali; which contributes to the growth of vegetables many
ways, as already de&s;cribed in No. 2. 6. of this Section.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>III. WATER.</HEAD>
<P>1. The nece&s;&s;ity of much water in the progre&s;s of vegetation
appears from the great quantity, which exi&s;ts naturally in all
parts of plants; in&s;omuch that many roots, as &s;quill and rhu|barb,
are known to lo&s;e about &s;ix parts out of &s;even of their
original weight &s;imply by drying them before the fire; which
quantity of moi&s;ture neverthele&s;s does dot exhale in the com|mon
heat of the atmo&s;phere during the life of the root; as is
<PB N="178" REF="184">
&s;een in the growth of &s;quills in the &s;hop&s; of the druggi&s;ts, and of
onions on the floors of our &s;tore-rooms.</P>
<P>2. A &s;econd nece&s;&s;ity of much water in the economy of ve|getation
may be deduced from the great per&s;piration of plants,
which appears from the experiments of Hales and others; who
like Sanctorius have e&s;timated the quantity of their per&s;piration
from their daily lo&s;s of weight; which however is not an accu|rate
conclu&s;ion either in re&s;pect to plants or animals, as they
both ab&s;orb moi&s;ture from the atmo&s;phere, as well as per&s;pire
it.</P>
<P>This great per&s;piration of vegetables, like that from the &s;kin
and lungs of animals, does not appear to con&s;i&s;t of excrementi|tious
matter, becau&s;e it has in general no putre&s;cent &s;mell or
ta&s;te; but &s;eems to be &s;ecreted fir&s;t for the purpo&s;e of keeping
the external &s;urface of the leaves from becoming dry, which
would prevent the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere from entering into
the vegetable blood through them; &s;ince according to the expe|riments
of Dr. Prie&s;tley on animal membranes the oxygen will
only pa&s;s through them, when they are moi&s;t. A &s;econd u&s;e of
this great per&s;piration is to keep the bark &s;upple by its moi&s;|ture,
and thus to prevent its being cracked by the motion of the
branches in the wind. And though a great part of this per&s;pi|rable
matter is probably ab&s;orbed, as on the &s;kins of animals;
yet as it exi&s;ts on &s;o large a &s;urface of leaves and twigs, much
of it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily evaporate on dry and windy days.</P>
<P>3. One of the great di&s;coveries of modern chemi&s;try is the
decompo&s;ition of water, which is &s;hown both by analy&s;is and
&s;ynthe&s;is to con&s;i&s;t of eighty-five hundredth parts of oxygen,
and fifteen of hydrogen. Hence a third great u&s;e of water in
the vegetable economy is probably owing to its ready decompo|&s;ition
by their organ of dige&s;tion, &s;anguification, and &s;ecretion.
This is evinced fir&s;t by the great quantity of hydrogen, which
exi&s;ts in the compo&s;ition of many of their inflammable parts.
And &s;econdly, from the curious circum&s;tances, which was fir&s;t
di&s;covered by the ingenious Dr. Prie&s;tley, that the water, which,
they per&s;pire, is hyperoxygenated; and in con&s;equence always
ready to part with its &s;uperabundance of oxygen, when expo&s;ed
to the &s;un's light; from whence it may be concluded, that part
<PB N="179" REF="185">
of the hydrogen, which was previou&s;ly an ingredient of this
water, had been &s;eparated from it, and u&s;ed in the vegetable
economy, as is further treated of in Section XIII. 1. 2.</P>
<P>Add to this, that from the decompo&s;ition of water, when
confined in contact with the air beneath the &s;oil, the nitrous
acid &s;eems to be produced and ammonia, both which are be|lieved
u&s;eful to vegetation, as mentioned in No. 2. 6. of this
Section.</P>
<P>4. Be&s;ides the peculiar u&s;es of a great quantity of water, as
above de&s;cribed, the more common u&s;es of it both to vegetable
and animal life, along with the matter of heat, are to produce
or pre&s;erve a due &s;upplene&s;s or lubricity of the &s;olids, and a due
degree of fluidity of the liquids, which they contain or circulate.
And la&s;tly, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;&s;olving or diffu&s;ing in it other
&s;olid or fluid &s;ub&s;tances, and thus rendering them capable of ab|&s;orption,
circulation, and &s;ecretion.</P>
<P>5. The due irrigation of the &s;oil is much attended to in drier
and warmer countries, as in Italy, Egypt, and &s;ome parts of
China; where numerous canals, and aqueducts, have been dug
through hills, and carried over vallies, for the purpo&s;e of water|ing
the &s;oil; and even in this colder and moi&s;ter climate the
practice of flooding land is coming daily into greater repute.
For this occa&s;ional &s;uffu&s;ion of water over land not only &s;upplies
&s;imple moi&s;ture for the purpo&s;es above mentioned in the drier
parts of the &s;ea&s;ons, but brings along with it calcareous earth
and azotic air from the neighbouring &s;prings, or other manures
from the rivers. Calcareous earth may be detected in the water
of all tho&s;e &s;prings which pa&s;s under or over &s;trata of marle or
lime&s;tone, by dropping into them a &s;olution of &s;alt of tartar; or
of &s;ugar of leadin water, or of &s;oap in &s;pirits of wine; and a por|tion
of azotic gas was di&s;covered in Bath-water by Dr. Prie&s;tley,
and in Buxton-water by Dr. Pier&s;on. See Section XI. 3. 1.
Dr. Home thinks he discovered nitrat of lime in hard water,
and found by his experiments that it promoted the growth of
plants in a much greater degree than &s;oft water.</P>
<P>6. Another demand for water in agriculture is to give a due
penetrability to the &s;oil, which otherwi&s;e in mo&s;t &s;ituations be|comes
&s;o hard as to &s;top the elongation of the tender roots of
<PB N="180" REF="186">
plants; but the cohe&s;ion of the &s;oil may neverthele&s;s be too
much dimini&s;hed by great and perpetual moi&s;ture, &s;o as not to
give &s;ufficient firmne&s;s to the roots of trees. And be&s;ides this
too much as well as too little water may be &s;upplied to the ge|nerality
of vegetables, which grow upon the land; though there
are aquatic and amphibious plants as well as aquatic and amphi|bious
animals, and which differ from each other as fi&s;h and
&s;eals from quadrupeds.</P>
<P>Where land abounds too much with moi&s;ture, the art of
making &s;ubterraneous or &s;uperficial drains de&s;cribed in Sect.
XI. 1. mu&s;t be had recour&s;e to. But where the&s;e are not exe|cuted,
in lands not very moi&s;t it is thought advantageous to &s;ow
the crops early before the wet &s;ea&s;on, &s;ince corn will bear
much more moi&s;ture after it has &s;hot from the &s;eed, than the
&s;eed will bear; as the &s;eed is le&s;s tenacious of life, and in con&s;e|quence
more liable to putrify. The crops &s;hould likewi&s;e be
&s;own or planted thinner, and be reaped early in the &s;ea&s;on, as
the exclu&s;ion of the air by thick foliage, and the greater damp|ne&s;s
of the autumn, are liable to generate mildew in moi&s;t &s;itua|tions.
Perhaps it &s;hould be added, that &s;owing early, and
the con&s;equent reaping early, has &s;o many advantages in all &s;ea|&s;ons
on all lands, that it may in general be univer&s;ally recom|mended;
and that in wet lands it might be very advantageous
to cultivate crops by tran&s;plantation in the vernal months, hav|ing
previou&s;ly &s;owed the &s;eed in drier or warmer &s;ituations.
See Sect. XVI. 8. 1.</P>
<P>7. Another injury in this climate occa&s;ioned by too great
a quantity of water ari&s;es from ha&s;ty &s;howers; which wa&s;h off
much of the decompo&s;ing animal and vegetable recrements,
which are &s;oluble or diffu&s;ible in water, and carry them down
the rivers into the &s;ea. From the &s;ides of hills this damage is
accompli&s;hed by &s;mall &s;howers, on which account all &s;loping
grounds when applied to agriculture &s;hould be ploughed horizon|tally,
as by the ridges and furrows thus produced the &s;maller
&s;howers of rain will not pa&s;s &s;o ha&s;tily off, as when they are
ploughed vertically.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion here occurs, whether it be advantageous to plough
level plains into ridges and furrows? the Chine&s;e are &s;aid never
<PB N="181" REF="187">
to divide their fields into ridges and furrows, but to plant
their grain on an even &s;urface. Emba&s;&s;y to China by &s;ir G.
Staunton, Vol. III. p. 197, 8vo. edit. Some think it an
error to &s;uppo&s;e, that any increa&s;e of crop can be thus obtained,
as no more plants can ri&s;e perpendicularly from the ground;
but in the ripening of grain the &s;urface of air to which the
ears are expo&s;ed is al&s;o to be con&s;idered; which corre&s;ponds with
the &s;urface of the ground; and is increa&s;ed by its being laid in
hill and dale. But there is a &s;erious objection to this mode of
ploughing in moi&s;t &s;ituations without &s;ufficient declivity, as the
corn in the furrows appears weak and backward owing to the
rain lying on it too long; and al&s;o to the be&s;t part of &s;hallow
&s;oils being frequently taken from them to con&s;truct the ridges.
See Sect. XVI. 2. 2.</P>
<P>8. Add to this, that the evaporation of moi&s;ture from the
&s;urface of the earth produces &s;o much cold as to injure tho&s;e
terre&s;trial plants, which are too long covered with it. On this
account tho&s;e parts of wall-trees, which are &s;heltered from the
de&s;cending dews by a coping &s;tone on the wall, are not &s;o liable
to be injured by fro&s;ty nights on two accounts; both as they are
not made colder by the evaporation of the dew, and al&s;o have
le&s;s water to be congealed in their ve&s;&s;els, and by its expan&s;ion
to bur&s;t them.</P>
<P>9. La&s;tly, the foliage on buds of plants, which con&s;titute one
part of their progeny, requires more moi&s;ture for its vigorous
growth, than their flowers or organs of &s;exual generation.
Hence in warm countries the rice-grounds are flooded only till
the &s;ea&s;on of flowering commences, and are laid dry again for
the purpo&s;e of maturating the &s;eed; and in our climate conti|nued
rains are liable not only to wa&s;h off the farina from the
bur&s;ting anthers, and thus prevent the impregnation of the
pi&s;tillum, but al&s;o to delay the ripening of the fruit or &s;eeds
from the want of a due evaporation of their per&s;pirable matter,
as well as from the le&s;s &s;olar light in cloudy &s;ea&s;ons; whence
in the north of Scotland the oats are &s;aid &s;eldom to ripen till
the fro&s;t commences with the dry &s;ea&s;on, which accompanies it.</P>

moi&s;ture of the &s;oil be&s;ides tho&s;e of canals and aqueducts, which
&s;hould be here mentioned. The&s;e are by u&s;ing as manures
&s;uch &s;ubstances as perpetually attract moi&s;ture from the lower
part of the &s;oil, or from the atmo&s;phere; as quick-lime, and
vegetable and animal recrements in the act of putrefaction.</P>
<P>In hot-hou&s;es &s;ome have already employed &s;team as a means
both of giving warmth and moi&s;ture to the included plants, or
to the &s;oil in which they grow; and a great variety of forcing
pumps have been con&s;tructed for the purpo&s;e of moi&s;tening the
foliage of wall-trees; but there is a hope from the pre&s;ent great
progre&s;s of chemical re&s;earch, that a means may &s;ometime be
di&s;covered of precipitating the water of the atmo&s;phere, which
the ingenious bi&s;hop Wat&s;on thinks always exi&s;ts in it in &s;uch
quantity as, if it was &s;uddenly precipitated, might again de|luge

<HEAD>IV. CARBON.</HEAD>
<P>1. When animal and vegetable bodies are burnt without the
acce&s;s of air, that is, when their volatile parts are &s;ublimed;
there remains a great quantity of charcoal, a much greater in
vegetable bodies than in animal ones; this is termed carbon by
the French &s;chool, when it is quite pure; and is now known
to be one of the mo&s;t univer&s;al materials of nature. And as
vegetable bodies contain &s;o much of it in their compo&s;ition,
they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to ab&s;orb it entire, where they grow
vi|gorou&s;ly; e&s;pecially as it is a &s;imple material; but they may
po&s;&s;ibly form it al&s;o occa&s;ionally from water and air within their
own ve&s;sels, when they are &s;ecluded from acce&s;s to it exter|nally.</P>
<P>The whole atmo&s;phere contains always a quantity of it in
the form of carbonic acid, or fixed air; as is known by the
&s;cum, which pre&s;ently becomes vi&s;ible on lime-water, when ex|po&s;ed
to the air; and which con&s;i&s;ts of a reunion of the lime
with carbonic acid; which may therefore be &s;aid to encompa&s;s the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="189">
The &s;implicity of carbon, as an elementary &s;ub&s;tance, was
di&s;puted by Dr. Au&s;tin, who believed he had decompounded it.
But Mr. Henry, by accurately repeating his experiments,
has &s;hewn the fallacy or inconclu&s;ivene&s;s of them. Philo&s;.
Tran&s;act. 1797.</P>
<P>2. Another great re&s;ervoir of carbon exi&s;ts in lime-&s;tone in
the form of carbonic acid; which when a &s;tronger acid is poured
on the calcareous earth becomes a gas, acquiring its nece&s;&s;ary
addition of heat from that, which is given out in the combina|tion
of the &s;tronger acid with the lime. It al&s;o acquires its
nece&s;&s;ary heat, when lime&s;tone is burnt, from the con&s;uming
fuel, ri&s;es in the form of gas, and is di&s;&s;ipated in the air; and probably &s;oon &s;ettles on the earth, as it cools, as it is ten times
heavier than the common atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>3. But the great &s;ource of carbon exi&s;ts in the black earth,
which has lately been left by the decompo&s;ition of vegetable and
animal bodies; and is then in a &s;tate fit to combine with azote
or nitrogen, and with oxygen, when expo&s;ed to those two
ga&s;&s;es, as they exi&s;t in the atmo&s;phere; and is thus adapted
either to promote the generation of nitrous acid, or to form car|bonic
acid, and thus to a&s;&s;i&s;t vegetation.</P>
<P>Mora&s;&s;es con&s;i&s;t principally of the carbonic recrements of
vegetable matter, which are gradually decompo&s;ed in great
length of time into clay, with argillaceous &s;and, &s;uch as is found
over coal-beds, and &s;ome calcareous earth, as in marle; and
la&s;tly, with &s;ome iron, and fo&s;&s;ile coal. The&s;e by elutriation are
&s;eparated from each other, and form the &s;trata of coal countries.
In other places they remain intermixed, as they were probably
produced from the decompo&s;ition of vegetables and terre&s;trial
animals; and form what in books of practical agriculture is cal|led
a <HI>loamy</HI> &s;oil, con&s;i&s;ting of carbonic matter, &s;and, and clay,
with a portion of iron.</P>
<P>It has always been ob&s;erved, that this black garden mould,
or earth produced from, the recrements of vegetables, is capa|ble
of ab&s;orbing a much greater quantity of putrid effluvia than
either air or water, and probably of combining with its ammo|nia,
and producing a kind of hepar carbonis, and thus facilitat|ing
vegetation. The practice of burying dead bodies so few feet
<PB N="184" REF="190">
below the &s;urface is a proof of this; as the putrid exhalations
from the carca&s;s are retained, and do not penetrate to the &s;ur|face.
On the &s;ame account the air over new ploughed fields
has long been e&s;teemed &s;alutary to invalids, or convale&s;cents,
as it probably purifies the &s;upernatent atmo&s;phere. But it was
not till lately known that carbon, or charcoal, ab&s;orbs with
&s;uch great avidity all putrid exhalations; if it has been recently
burnt, and has not been already &s;aturated with them, in&s;omuch
that putrid fle&s;h is said to be much &s;weetened by being covered
a few inches with the powder of charcoal; or even by being
buried for a time in black garden mould; as putrid exhalations
con&s;i&s;t chiefly of ammonia, hydrogen, and carbonic acid, and
are the immediate products of the di&s;&s;olution of animal or vege|table
bodies, they are believed much to contribute to vegetation;
as whatever materials have con&s;tituted an organic body, may
again after a certain degree of di&s;&s;olution form a part of another
organic body. The hydrogen and azote produce ammonia,
which combining with carbon may form an hepar carbonis, and
by thus rendering carbon &s;oluble in water may much contribute
to the growth of vegetables.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that &s;ome mora&s;&s;es have prevented the ani|mal
bodies, which have been buried in them, from putrefaction;
which may in part have been owing to the great attraction of the
carbon of the mora&s;s to putrid effluvia, and in part perhaps
to the vitriolic acid, which &s;ome mora&s;&s;es are said to contain.</P>
<P>4. Here occurs an important que&s;tion, by what other means
is this &s;olid carbon rendered fluid, &s;o as to be capable of entering
the fine mouths of vegetable ab&s;orbents? The carbon, which
exi&s;ts in the atmo&s;phere, and in lime&s;tone, is united with oxy|gen,
and thence becomes &s;oluble or diffu&s;ible in water; and
may thus be ab&s;orbed by the living action of vegetable ve&s;&s;els;
or may be again combined by chemical attraction with the lime,
which has been deprived of it by calcination.</P>
<P>When mild calcareous earth, as lime&s;tone, chalk, marble,
has been deprived of its water and of its carbonic acid by calci|nation,
it becomes lime. Afterwards when it is cold, if water
be &s;prinkled on it, a con&s;iderable heat is in&s;tantly perceived;
which is pre&s;&s;ed out by the combination of a part of the water
<PB N="185" REF="191">
with the lime; as all bodies, when they change from a fluid
&s;tate to a &s;olid one, give out the heat, which before kept them
fluid. At the &s;ame time another part of the water, which was
added, is rai&s;ed into &s;team by the great heat given out as above
mentioned; and the expan&s;ion of this &s;team breaks the lime into
fine powder, which otherwi&s;e retains the form of the lumps of
limestone before calcination. But if too great a quantity of
cold water be &s;uddenly added, no &s;team is rai&s;ed; and the
lump of lime retains its form; whence it happens, that &s;ome
kinds of lime fall into finer powder, and are &s;aid to make better
mortar, if &s;laked with boiling water than with cold.</P>
<P>On this account the lime, which is de&s;igned to be &s;pread on
land, &s;hould previou&s;ly be laid on a heap, and either &s;uffered to
become moi&s;t by the water of the atmo&s;phere, or &s;laked by a
proper quantity of water; otherwi&s;e if it be &s;pread on wet
ground, or when &s;o &s;pread is expo&s;ed to much rain, the heat
generated will be dissipated without breaking the lumps of lime into
powder; which will then gradually harden again into
limestone, di&s;appoint the expectation of the agricultor, and
afflict him with the lo&s;s of much labour and expence.</P>
<P>When the powder of &s;laked lime mixed with &s;and and water
is &s;pread on a wall, that part of the water which is not nece&s;&s;ary
for its imperfect cry&s;tallization, evaporates into the air; and the
lime then gradually attracts the carbonic acid, which is diffu&s;ed
in the atmosphere; but as I &s;uppo&s;e this carbonic acid is di&s;&s;olv|ed
in the water, which is also diffu&s;ed in the atmo&s;phere; the lime
is perpetually moi&s;tened by this new acqui&s;ition of water from
the air; as that, which before adhered to it, and had parted
with its carbonic acid, evaporates. On which account new
built walls are months, and even years, in drying, as they con|tinue
to attract water along with the carbonic acid from the air,
which &s;tands upon them in drops, till the lime regains its origi|nal
quantity of carbonic acid, and again hardens into &s;tone, or
forms a &s;par by its more perfect or less di&s;turbed cry&s;talliza|tion.</P>
<P>5. The earth I &s;uppo&s;e acquires carbon, both in a manner
&s;imilar to the above by its attracting either the carbonic acid, or
the water in which it is diffu&s;ed, from the atmo&s;phere; and also
<PB N="186" REF="192">
by the &s;pecific gravity of carbonic acid gas being ten times greater
than that of common air; whence there mu&s;t be con&s;tantly a
reat &s;ediment of it on the &s;urface of the earth; which in its
&s;tate of &s;olution in oxygen and water may be readily drank up
by the roots of vegetables.</P>
<P>6. Another means by which vegetables acquire carbon in
great quantity may be from lime&s;tone di&s;&s;olved in water;
which though a &s;low proce&s;s occurs in innumerable &s;prings of
water, which pa&s;s through the calcareous or marly &s;trata of the
earth; as tho&s;e of Matlock and Bri&s;tol in pa&s;&s;ing through lime|&s;tone;
and tho&s;e about Derby in pa&s;&s;ing through marl; and is
brought to the roots of vegetables by the &s;howers, which fall on
&s;oils, where marl, chalk, lime&s;tone, marble, alaba&s;ter, fluor,
exi&s;t; which includes almo&s;t the whole of this i&s;land. By this
&s;olution of mild calcareous earth in water not only the carbon
in the form of carbonic acid not yet made into gas, but the lime
al&s;o, with which it is united, becomes ab&s;orbed into the vege|table
&s;y&s;tem, and thus contributes to the nutriment of plants
both as &s;o much calcareous earth, and as &s;o much carbon.</P>
<P>7. Another mode by which vegetables acquire carbon, may
be by the union of this &s;imple &s;ub&s;tance, with which all garden-mould
abounds, with pure calcareous earth into a kind of hepar,
analogous to the hepar of &s;ulphur made with lime, which
abounds in &s;ome mineral waters. And this I &s;uppo&s;e to be the
great u&s;e of lime in agriculture.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;e of a&s;certaining the probability of this mode
of &s;olution of carbon I made the following experiment. About
two ounces of lime in powder were mixed with about as much
charcoal in powder, put into a crucible, and covered with an
inch or two of filiceous &s;and. The crucible was kept red hot
for an hour or longer, and then &s;uffered to cool. On the next day
water was poured on the lime and charcoal, which then &s;tood a day or two in an open cup, and acquired a calcareous &s;cum on its &s;urface. And though it had not much ta&s;te, except of the
cau&s;ticity of the lime, yet on dropping one drop of marine acid
into a tea-&s;poonful of the clear solution a &s;trong &s;mell like that
of hepar &s;ulphuris was perceived, or like that of Harrogate
<PB N="187" REF="193">
water; which evinced, that the carbon was thus rendered &s;o|luble
in water.</P>
<P>Perhaps the &s;ulphureous &s;mell of Harrogate and Kedle&s;ton
waters, and other &s;imilar &s;prings, may be owing to the union
of the alkali of decompo&s;ing marine &s;alt with the carbon of the
earth, they run through? and this kind of water might thus
po&s;&s;ibly be u&s;ed as a profitable manure!</P>
<P>8. Another mode by which vegetable roots acquire carbon,
I &s;u&s;pect to be by their di&s;uniting carbonic acid from lime&s;tone
in its fluid not its ga&s;&s;eous &s;tate; which the lime&s;tone again at|tracts
from the atmo&s;phere and con&s;olidates, or from other
matters included in the &s;oil. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e lime is believed by
&s;ome agricultors, who much employ it, to do more &s;ervice in
the &s;econd year than in the fir&s;t; that is, in its mild &s;tate,
when it abounds with carbonic acid, than in its caustic &s;tate,
when it is deprived of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the u&s;e of burning lime &s;eems hence to be &s;im|ply
to reduce it to an impalpable powder, almo&s;t approaching
to fluidity; which mu&s;t facilitate the application of the innu|merable
extremities of vegetable fibres to this uncalculable in|crea&s;e
of its &s;urface; which may thence acquire by their ab&s;or|bent
power the carbonic acid from the&s;e minute particles of
lime, as fa&s;t as they can recover it by chemical attraction from
the air, or water, or from other inanimate &s;ub&s;tances in their
vicinity.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the hyper-oxygenation of the per&s;pirable matter of
plants, which thence gives up oxygen gas in the &s;un&s;hine, would
induce us to believe, that a great part of the carbon, which fur|nishes
&s;o principal a part of vegetable nutriment, was received
by their roots in the form of carbonic acid; and that it becomes
in part decompo&s;ed in their circulation, giving up its oxygen;
which thus abounds in the &s;ecreted fluids of vegetables from this
&s;ource, as well as from decompo&s;ed water.</P>
<P>9. Another way by which carbon is received into the vege|table
&s;y&s;tem is by its exi&s;tence in &s;ugar and in mucilage; both
which are taken up undecompounded, as appears by their pre|&s;ence
in the vernal &s;ap-juice, which is obtained from the maple
<PB N="188" REF="194">
and the birch; which like the chyle of animals, is ab&s;orbed in
its undecompounded &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>V. PHOSPHORUS.</HEAD>
<P>1. Another material which exi&s;ts, I believe, univer&s;ally in
vegetables, and has not yet been &s;ufficiently attended to, is
pho&s;phorus. This like the carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and
&s;ulphur, is probably a &s;imple &s;ub&s;tance; as our pre&s;ent chemi&s;try
has not yet certainly analy&s;ed any of them; and therefore I
&s;uppo&s;e it is taken up intire by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of vegetables,
when it can be met with in a &s;tate of &s;olution; though it may
al&s;o be occa&s;ionally formed and &s;ecreted by them; and may
hence be regi&s;tered among the articles of their food or &s;u&s;te|nance.</P>
<P>When wood is decompo&s;ed by putrefaction in a certain de|gree
of warmth and moisture, it is often &s;een to emit much light
in dark evenings, when recently broken and expo&s;ed to the
oxygen of the atmo&s;phere, &s;o as to alarm benighted pa&s;&s;engers;
which is undoubtedly owing to the pho&s;phorus, which it contains
and which is at this time converted into pho&s;phoric acid. Such
a light frequently is &s;een on putre&s;cent veal, when kept in a cer|tain
degree of warmth and moi&s;ture; and on the &s;ea-weed plac|ed
on the oy&s;ters packed in barrels, and &s;ent into the country;
and in the &s;treets of Edinburgh where the heads of the fi&s;h
called whitings or haddies are frequently thrown out by the peo|ple,
I have on a dark night ea&s;ily &s;een the hour by holding one
of them to my watch.</P>
<P>2. The exi&s;tence of pho&s;phorus in vegetables was detected
by Margraaf; who found, that many vegetable matters, parti|cularly
farinaceous grains, contain enough of the pho&s;phoric acid to
produce pho&s;phorus, when they are expo&s;ed to great
heat in close ve&s;&s;els. Macquer's Chemical Dictionary translated
by Mr. Keir, Vol. II. p. 535, Art. Pho&s;phorus. Pho&s;|phorus
has been detected in gum arabic, &s;ugar, honey, flour,
and in every kind of vegetable or animal &s;ub&s;tance by the
proce&s;s of making the pho&s;phorus of Homberg. And the exi&s;tence of
pho&s;phorus in greater quantity in all the parts and recrements
<PB N="189" REF="195">
of animals, as in their fle&s;h, dung, urine, and bone-a&s;hes, and
mo&s;t copiou&s;ly in the two latter, is evinced in the fabrication of
Kunke's pho&s;phorus. Whence its univer&s;al exi&s;tence is di&s;co|vered
in the&s;e two great kingdoms of nature. See the above
Dict. Art. Pyrophorus.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t easy proce&s;s for producing Homberg's pho&s;phorus
con&s;i&s;ts in mixing three parts of alum with one of &s;ugar, which
are to be expo&s;ed to a great heat in a covered crucible, till a
blui&s;h flame has appeared for &s;ome time. It mu&s;t then be &s;uffer|ed
to cool a little, and be put into a dry hot bottle, and clo&s;ely
&s;topped from the air. A drachm of this powder will after|wards,
when poured from the bottle into the open air on paper,
quickly kindle, become red like burning coals, and burn the
paper, which it lies upon.</P>
<P>Hence we may conclude, that vegetable bodies, as well as
animal ones, contain acid of pho&s;phorus; and that in this expe|riment
the acid of the alum takes the fixed alkaline &s;alt from the
vegetable a&s;hes, and the calcareous earth, if &s;uch there be, and
that the carbon unites with the oxygen of the pho&s;phoric acid;
and the vegetable pho&s;phorus is left mingled with the earth of
alum; exactly in the &s;ame manner as the animal pho&s;phorus is
obtained from the a&s;hes of bones, or the &s;alt of urine, by calcin|ing
them in clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els with charcoal.</P>
<P>3. An important que&s;tion now occurs; if this &s;imple mate|rial
of pho&s;phorus be not generally made in the ve&s;&s;els of vege|tables,
whence do they acquire it? They may probably obtain
it in con&s;iderable quantity from the recrements of decaying ve|getable
and animal bodies; as it appears in rotten wood, and in
putrefying fi&s;h, and exi&s;ts in &s;uch large quantities in bone-a&s;hes,
and in the &s;alt of urine. But I &s;uppo&s;e there is another great
&s;ource of pho&s;phorus, I mean in calcareous earth, which al&s;o
has been of animal origin in the early ages of the world.</P>
<P>If an oyster-&s;hell be calcined for about half an hour in a com|mon
fire, and is then kept from the air in a cold place; when
it is afterwards expo&s;ed for a while to the &s;un&s;hine, and brought
into a dark room, it will appear luminous like the calcined Bo|lognian
&s;tone; which is owing to the phosphoric acid thus de|prived
of its oxygen by the carbon of the fire-coals, and inter|mingled
<PB N="190" REF="196">
with the pure calcareous earth or lime of the &s;hell; and
which again combining with the oxygen of the air, both light
and heat are emitted in the reproduction of pho&s;phoric acid.
See Wi&s;on on Pho&s;phoric, Dod&s;ley, London, 1795.</P>
<P>The Bolognian &s;tone is a &s;elenite or gyp&s;um, which con&s;i&s;ts
of vitriolic acid and calcareous earth, and I &s;u&s;o&s;e of acid of
pho&s;phorus; &s;ince on mixing the powder of this &s;tone with gum
arabic, and calcining it &s;ome time, a kind of pho&s;phorus is
produced &s;imilar to the above, owing I &s;uppose to the carbon of
the fire coals, or of the gum arabic, carrying off the oxygen
from the phosphoric acid; which previou&s;ly exi&s;ted both in the
calcareous earth of the &s;elenite, and in the a&s;hes of the gum
arabic.</P>
<P>Mr. Canton, in the Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. Vol. LVIII p. 337,
publi&s;hed his making a pyrophorus by calcining oy&s;ter-&s;hells,
and then mixing them reduced to powder with &s;ulphur,
and recalcining them in clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els. This powder after being
expo&s;ed to light, or heated by other means, became luminous
in the dark for many minutes. By this proce&s;s the acid of pho&s;|phorus
exi&s;ting in the animal &s;hell had been decompo&s;ed by the
red hot &s;ulphur having robbed it of its oxygen; and thus the
pho&s;phorus remained united with the calcareous earth.</P>
<P>M. Du Fay, in a memoir publi&s;hed in the year 1730, a&s;&s;erts
from experiments, that all calcareous &s;tones, whether they con|tain
vitriolic acid or not, are capable of becoming luminous by
calcination; with this difference only, that the pure calcareous
&s;tones require a &s;tronger or repeated calcination; whereas tho&s;e,
which contain an acid, as &s;elenites, or gyp&s;um, become pho&s;|phoric
by &s;lighter calcination. M. Margraaf al&s;o a&s;&s;erts, that
all kinds of calcareous &s;tones may by calcination be rendered
phosphoric; but thinks, that the pure ones &s;hould be previou&s;ly
&s;aturated with an acid. Keir's Dict. Art. Pho&s;phorus. And
la&s;tly, &s;ome kinds of fluor, which is known to con&s;i&s;t of calca|reous
earth and the fluor-acid, emit pho&s;phoric light on being
heated &s;lowly, but lo&s;e it, when much ignited. (Kirwan's Mi|neralogy.)
This material might probably as well as gyp&s;um be|come
u&s;eful in agriculture.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="197">
4. The&s;e experiments, which &s;hew that all common calca|reous
&s;tones, which contain only carbonic acid, were render|ed
pho&s;phoric by calcination; but that tho&s;e which did contain
a fixed acid, as gyp&s;um, and fluor, were rendered pho&s;phoric
with le&s;s difficulty, acquaint us fir&s;t with perhaps one very
important u&s;e of lime in agriculture. Secondly, with that al&s;o
of gyp&s;um, or alaba&s;ter, which has lately been u&s;ed in Ame|rica
and in Germany without previous calcination; but which
might probably be more &s;ucce&s;sful after calcination. And
And thirdly, with the probable u&s;e of fluor &s;par in its recent
or calcined &s;tate. As there is rea&s;on to believe, that the vege|table
&s;y&s;tem may ab&s;orb pho&s;phorus from any of these materials;
which pho&s;phorus may originally have been of animal origin, as
well as that which exi&s;ts in feces and urine. And la&s;tly, the
use of recent &s;hells or bones ground into powder, or of bone-a&s;hes,
&s;pread on land may be deduced; as they con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t
entirely of pho&s;phorus and calcareous earth.</P>
<P>5. In the conver&s;ion of &s;hells into lime&s;tone there &s;eems to have been
either &s;imply an additional quantity of carbonic acid
attracted from the air or from water during the proce&s;&s;ion of
ages, and added to the calcareous earth, or al&s;o a diminution
of the pho&s;phoric acid. But an union of pho&s;phoric acid only
with lime has lately been found to compo&s;e whole mountains in
Spain, which is mentioned by Fourcroy, and is now termed
pho&s;phate of lime, re&s;embling bone-a&s;hes. And M. Brumaire
lately received from Spain a yellowi&s;h tran&s;lucent &s;tone, called
chry&s;olite by the jewellers, which he found to contain nearly
equal parts of pho&s;phoric acid and calcareous earth, and to be
&s;par or cry&s;tallization of the pho&s;phate of lime. And as the
lime&s;tone at Breedon has Iately been di&s;covered to contain equal
parts of magne&s;ia and lime, we may hope by greater attention to
di&s;cover a mountain of pho&s;phate of lime in our own country.
See Nichol&s;on's Journal 1798, p. 414.</P>
<P>From hence it would appear, that the immen&s;e quantities of
lime&s;tone in the world, which was originally formed from the
&s;hells of &s;ubmarine animals, has during the long lap&s;e of time
lo&s;t more or le&s;s of its original pho&s;phoric acid, and acquired
<PB N="192" REF="198">
more or le&s;s carbonic acid. The carbon di&s;&s;olved in the atmo&s;|phere
or in the ocean having thus &s;lowly decomposed the pho&s;|phoric
acid in the elaboratory of nature without great heat, as it
does in our crucibles in a &s;hort time by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of great
heat.</P>
<P>It is probable that much pho&s;phorus may be con&s;umed in our
inartificial mode of burning lime, which might be pre&s;erved by
calcining lime&s;tone in clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and thus detaching the car|bonic
acid without admitting the aerial oxygen to the pho&s;pho|rus;
but the advantage to agriculture of &s;uch a proce&s;s can only
be determined by experiment.</P>
<P>There are many in&s;tances given by Mr. Ander&s;on, and by
Lord Kaims, of &s;oils which are &s;aid to have been for ages un|commonly
fertile without addition of manures or culture. The&s;e
are plains near the &s;hore in the county of Caithne&s;s, and in the
Hebrides, and are &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t entirely of &s;hells broken
into very &s;mall particles, without almo&s;t any mixture of other
&s;oil. See Encyclop. Britan. Art. Agricult. Now the &s;oil of
an exten&s;ive country called Lincoln Heath I ob&s;erved &s;ome
years ago to con&s;i&s;t in a great degree of powdered lime&s;tone,
which like the Ketton lime&s;tone appeared in &s;mall rounded par|ticles,
which I &s;uppo&s;e had in remote times been di&s;&s;olved in
water, and again precipitated; which &s;hews a probable differ|ence
between this lime and recent &s;hells in re&s;pect to their anti|quity,
and con&s;equently that the former mu&s;t contain much of
the original pho&s;phoric acid, and the latter only carbonic acid.
And as Lincoln Heath was then e&s;teemed a very unproductive
&s;oil, there is rea&s;on to infer that the pho&s;phoric acid in recent
&s;hells is of greatly more &s;ervice to agriculture than the carbonic
acid of alluvial lime&s;tone, or than calcined lime alone.</P>
<P>Hence it is probable, that a greater quantity of pho&s;phoric
acid may exi&s;t in &s;ome marles than in others, as well as in
&s;ome lime&s;tones; thus the appearance of recent &s;hells exi&s;ts in the
lime near Loughborough in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, in the road to Not|tingham,
and in &s;ome marles called &s;hell-marl; which mu&s;t
therefore probably contain much more pho&s;phoric acid, &s;o as
almo&s;t to resemble the bones of animals; and may thus be more
friendly to vegetation. A piece of land is mentioned by Mr.
<PB N="193" REF="199">
Ander&s;on, that, after a thick Coat of marle laid on it, bore crops
for thirty years without additional improvement, and I think it
was called &s;hell-marle. See Encyclop. Britan. Agricult.</P>
<P>6. A medical philo&s;opher, M. Bonhomme, has endeavoured
&s;hew, that the hardne&s;s of animal bones depends on the quantity
of pho&s;phoric acid united to calcareous earth, which they con|tain;
and that the rickets, a di&s;ea&s;e in which the bones become
too &s;oft, is &s;olely owing to the want of it, or to the exi&s;tence of
the vegetable acid in&s;tead of it. Annales de Chemie, Vol.
XVII. May we not conclude, that the pre&s;ence of pho&s;pho|ric
acid in the vegetable &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t be of importance; becau&s;e it
so univer&s;ally exi&s;ts in them, and may probably give firmne&s;s to
liqueos as well as to o&s;&s;eous fibres? To which may be added,
that M. Fourcroy believes, that the a&s;hes of burnt vegetables,
which have been &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of earth or clay, when the
$ixed alkali is wa&s;hed from them, are principally calcareous
pho&s;phorus, like tho&s;e of animal bones. The &s;ame is a&s;&s;erted
by Lord Dundonald in his Connection of Agriculture and
Chemi&s;try, p. 25, who calls the in&s;oluble part of vegetable
a&s;hes a pho&s;phat of lime. This &s;ubject is worthy further inve&s;ti|gation.</P>

<HEAD>VI. LIME.</HEAD>
<P>Many of the principal u&s;es of calcareous earth in promoting
the growth of vegetables have been already mentioned in this
&s;ection, which we &s;hall recapitulate with additions.</P>
<P>1. One great u&s;e of calcareous earth I &s;u&s;pect to con&s;i&s;t in its
uniting with the carbon of the &s;oil in its pure or cau&s;tic &s;tate, or
with that of vegetable or animal recrements during &s;ome part of
the proce&s;s of putrefaction; and thus rendering it &s;oluble in
water by forming an hepar carbonis, &s;omewhat like an hepar &s;ul|phuris
produced by lime and &s;ulphur, as mentioned in No. 4. 7.
of this Sect.; by which proce&s;s I &s;uppo&s;e the carbon is rendered
capable of being ab&s;orbed by the lacteal ve&s;&s;els of vegetable
roots.</P>
<P>The black liquor, which flows from dunghills, is probably a
fluid of this kind; but I mean to &s;peak hypothetically, as I have
not verified it by experiment; and the carbon may be &s;imply &s;up|ported
<PB N="194" REF="200">
in the water say mucilage, like the coffee drank at our
tea-tables; or may be converted into an hepar carbonis by its
union with the fixed alkali of decaying vegetable matter, or by
the volatile alkali, which accompanies some &s;tages of putrefaction.
See No. 10. 3. of this Section.</P>
<P>2. A &s;econd mode of its &s;erving the purpo&s;es of vegetation I
believe to be by its union with carbonic acid, and rendering it
thus &s;oluble in water in its fluid &s;tate in&s;tead of its being ex|panded
into a gas; and that thus a great quantity of carbon
may be drank up by vegetable ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In the practice newly introduced of watering lands by de|riving
&s;treams over them for many weeks together, I am informed&punc;
that water from &s;prings is generally more effectual in promoting
vegetation than that from rivers; which though it may in part
be owing to the azotic gaz, or nitrogen, contained in &s;ome
&s;prings, as tho&s;e of Buxton and of Bath, according to the ana|ly&s;is
of Dr. Prie&s;tley, and of Dr. Pear&s;on; yet I &s;uppo&s;e it to
be principally owing to the calcareous earth, which abounds in
all &s;prings, which pa&s;s over marly &s;oils, or through calcareous
&s;trata; and which does not exi&s;t in rivers, as the &s;alts wa&s;hed in|to
rivers from the &s;oil all &s;eem to decompo&s;e each other, except
the marine &s;alt, and &s;ome magne&s;ian &s;alt, which are carried down
into the ocean. The calcareous earth likewi&s;e which is wa&s;hed
into rivers, enters into new combinations, as into gyp&s;um, or
perhaps into &s;iliceo$s &s;and, and &s;ub&s;ides. The&s;e &s;olutions of
calcareous earth in tho&s;e waters, which are termed hard waters,
and which incru&s;t the &s;ides of our tea-kettles, may po&s;&s;ibly al&s;o
contribute to the nutriment of animals, as mentioned in Zoono|mia,
Part III. Article I. 2. 4. 2.</P>
<P>3. A third mode, by which lime promotes vegetation, I &s;up|po&s;e
may be a&s;cribed to its containing pho&s;phorus; which by its
union with it may be converted into an hepar, and thus rendered
&s;oluble in water, without its becoming an acid by the addition of
oxygen. Pho&s;phorus is probably as nece&s;&s;ary an ingredient in vegetable
as in animal bodies; which appears by the pho&s;phoric
light vi&s;ible on rotten wood during &s;ome &s;tages of putrefaction;
in which I &s;uppo&s;e the pho&s;phorus is &s;et at liberty from the cal|careous
earth, or from the fixed alkali, or from the carbon of
<PB N="195" REF="201">
the decompo&s;ing wood, and acquires oxygen from the atmo&s;|phere;
and both warmth and light are emitted during their
union. But pho&s;phorus may perhaps more frequently exi&s;t in
the form of pho&s;phoric acid in vegetables, and may thus be rea|dily
united with their calcareous earth, as mentioned in No. 5. 6.
of this Section, and may be &s;eparated from its acid by the
carbon of the vegetable during calcination, and al&s;o during pu|trefaction,
which may be con&s;idered as a &s;low combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of a &s;olution of pho&s;phoric acid and calcareous
earth in the ve&s;&s;els of animals is proved by the annual renova|tion
of the &s;hells of crab-&s;i&s;h, and by the fabrication of the egg-&s;hells
in female birds; and is occa&s;ionally &s;ecreted, where it ce|ments
the wounds made on &s;nail-&s;hells; or where it joins the
pre&s;ent year's growth of a &s;nail-&s;hell to the part, where a mem|braneous
cover had been attached for the protection of the animal
during its &s;tate of hibernation. And la&s;tly, it is evident from
the growth of the bones of quadrupeds, and from the depo&s;ition
of callus to join them where they have been broken.</P>
<P>4. Lime in its pure &s;tate is &s;oluble in about 600 times its
weight of water; and by a greater quantity of carbonic acid
than is nece&s;&s;ary for its cry&s;tallization, it is &s;oluble in water in
much greater quantities, as appears by the calcareous depo&s;ition
of the water at Matlock; and may I &s;uppo&s;e &s;upply a nutritious
&s;ub&s;tance by uniting with mucilage or oil, either in the earth at
the roots of vegetables, or on the &s;urface of the &s;oil, which may
be gradually washed down to them.</P>
<P>If a &s;olution of &s;oap be poured into lime-water, the oil of the
&s;oap combines with the calcareous earth, and the cau&s;tic alkali is
&s;et at liberty, according to the experiments of Mr. Bertholet;
(&s;ee Nichol&s;on's Journal, Vol. I. p. 170,) who concludes, that
oil has a &s;tronger affinity to calcareous earth than it has to fixed
alkali. At the &s;ame time it appeared, that a &s;olution of the
mild or efferve&s;cent fixed alkali poured on this calcareous &s;oap
would decompo&s;e it by twofold elective attraction; as the car|bonic
acid of the mild fixed alkali unites with the calcareous
earth of the calcareous &s;oap, and the oil unites with the pure or
cau&s;tic alkali.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="202">
Many arguments may be adduced to &s;hew, that calcareous
earth either alone, or in &s;ome of the &s;tates of combination above
mentioned, may contribute to the nouri&s;hment both of animals
and vegetables. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e calcareous earth con&s;titutes a
con&s;iderable part of them, and mu&s;t therefore either be received
from without, or formed by them, or both. Secondly, becau&s;e
from the analogy of all organic life, whatever has compo&s;ed a part
of a vegetable or animal, may again after its chemical &s;olution
become a part of another vegetable or animal; &s;uch is the gene|ral
tran&s;migration of matter!</P>
<P>5. There are other u&s;es of lime in agriculture, which may not
be a&s;cribed to it as a nutritive food for vegetables, but from its
producing &s;ome chemical or mechanical effects upon the &s;oil, or
upon other manures with which it is mixed; as fir&s;t, from its
de&s;toying in a &s;hort time the cohe&s;ion of dead vegetable fibres,
and thus reducing them to earth; which otherwi&s;e is effected by
a &s;low proce&s;s, either by the con&s;umption of in&s;ects, or by a gra|dual
putrefaction. This is &s;aid to be performed both by mild
and by cau&s;tic calcareous earth, as in the experiments both of
Pringle and Macbride. It is &s;aid that unburnt calcareous earth
forwards the putrefaction of a mixture of animal and vegetable
matter. But that pure lime, though it &s;eemed to prevent putre|faction,
de&s;troyed or di&s;&s;olved the texture of the fle&s;h. Thus I
am informed, that a mixture of lime with oak-bark, after the
tanner has extracted from it whatever is &s;oluble in water, will
in two or three months reduce it to a fine black earth; which
if only laid in heaps, would require as many years to effect by
its own &s;pontaneous fermentation or putrefaction. This effect of
lime mu&s;t be particularly advantageous to newly enclo&s;ed com|mons
when fir&s;t broken up.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis, in the papers of the Society of Arts, Vol. XVI.
p. 122, a&s;&s;erts, that on a common, which had been previou&s;ly
covered with heath, but was otherwi&s;e very barren, the effect of
lime was very advantageous for about ten years, during which
time the vegetable roots might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been di&s;&s;olved
and expended; but that a &s;econd liming he ob&s;erved produced
no good effect. It is probable the good effect might not be &s;o
<PB N="197" REF="203">
great, but I &s;hould doubt she circum&s;tance of its producing no
good effect at all.</P>
<P>Mr. Browne of Derby has al&s;o an ingenious paper in the
tran&s;actions of the Society of Arts, in which he a&s;&s;erts, that
recent vegetables, as clover, laid on heaps and &s;tratified with
fre&s;h lime, are quickly decompo&s;ed, even in a few days. The
heat occa&s;ioned by the moi&s;ture of the vegetables uniting with
the lime I &s;uppo&s;e quickens the fermentation of the vegetable
juices, and produces charcoal in con&s;equence of combu&s;tion,
&s;imilar to that frequently produced in new hay&s;tacks, which if
air be admitted bur&s;t into flame.</P>
<P>Secondly, lime for many months continues to attract moi&s;|ture
from the air or earth; which it deprives I &s;uppo&s;e of car|bonic
acid, and then &s;uffers it to exhale again, as is &s;een on the
pla&s;tered walls of new hou&s;es. On this account it mu&s;t be ad|vantageous
when mixed with dry or &s;andy &s;oils, as it attracts
moi&s;ture from the air above, or the earth beneath; and this
moi&s;ture is then ab&s;orbed by the lymphatics of the roots of ve|getables.</P>
<P>Thirdly, by mixing lime with clays it is believed to make them
le&s;s cohe&s;ive; and thus to admit of their being more ea&s;ily pene|trated
by vegetable fibres.</P>
<P>Fourthly, a mixture of lime with clay de&s;troy its &s;uperabun|dancy
of acid, if &s;uch exi&s;ts; and by uniting with it converts it
into gyp&s;um, or alaba&s;ter.</P>
<P>Fifthly, when lime is mixed with a compo&s;t of &s;oil and ma|nure,
which is in the &s;tate of generating nitrous acid, it arre&s;ts
the acid as it forms, and produces a calcareous nitre, and thus
prevents both its exhalation and its ea&s;y elutriation.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, fre&s;h lime de&s;troys worms, &s;nails, and other in|&s;ects,
with which it happens to come in contact, and with which
almo&s;t every &s;oil abounds.</P>
<P>6. The various properties of lime above de&s;cribed account for
the great u&s;es of it on almo&s;t all lands; except perhaps &s;ome of
those which already abound with calcareous earth.</P>
<P>On riding from Beckingham to Sleaford, and from thence to
Lincoln, I was informed by three or four farmers, that lime had
<PB N="198" REF="204">
been tried, but was believed to be of no &s;ervice in that country.
Nor was I &s;urprized at this ob&s;ervation, as I had &s;een fragments
of alluvial lime&s;tone thrown out of every ditch on the road,
which was of a loo&s;e texture, con&s;i&s;ting of calcareous &s;and, like
the Ketton lime&s;tone, rounded by friction, before it was con|&s;olidated
into a ma&s;s, the upper &s;urface of which was broken
into fragments when it was rai&s;ed from the &s;ea by &s;ubterraneous
fires, or by its cooling from a hot &s;tate or its drying from a
moi&s;t one.</P>
<P>Thus, as I had ridden over one &s;ingle alluvial lime&s;tone above
ten miles broad and above twenty long, the broken &s;urface of
which appeared in the bottom of almo&s;t every ditch, I concluded,
that the &s;oil mu&s;t be calcareous earth mixed only with &s;ome ani|mal
and vegetable recrements, and that an addition of pure lime
could probably not be of much advantage to the vegetables it
&s;upported. And the &s;ame I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t occur in tho&s;e &s;itua|tions,
where the &s;urface of the &s;oil con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t totally of
chalk, which is another kind of alluvial lime&s;tone; that is,
which has been di&s;&s;olved in water in the early ages of the world,
and again depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>Yet even in &s;ome &s;oils, which abound in calcareous earth,
lime is e&s;teemed to be of &s;ervice; which may be owing both to
its cau&s;tic quality, and to its being &s;o finely pulverized. For a
part of the water, which combines with it after calcination, gives
out &s;o much heat as to convert another part of it into &s;team;
which breaks the calcined lime-lumps into a mo&s;t &s;ubtile and im|palpable
powder, approaching even to fluidity, as mentioned in
No. 4. 4. of this Section.</P>
<P>In the pari&s;h of Hartington in Derby&s;hire there is a &s;tratum
of hard lime&s;tone, or marble, as I am informed, immediately
beneath a &s;hallow &s;oil, and which in many places peeps through
it; yet on &s;ome of this land an ingenious active agricultor has
laid lime on the gra&s;s in great quantity with prodigious advan|tage;
and that he continues annually to improve by this means a
con&s;iderable extent of land.</P>
<P>The difference between the hard lime&s;tone of this part of
Derby&s;hire, and the &s;oft &s;and-formed lime&s;tone about Lincoln
Heath and Sleaford, may render the incumbent &s;oil to be more
<PB N="199" REF="205">
or le&s;s mixed with calcareous earth; or they may abound more
or le&s;s with pho&s;phoric acid, as mentioned in No. 5. 5. of this
Section. But it may have happened, that &s;ome prejudices of
the farmers, who gave me the information, might have led them
to condemn the u&s;e of lime about Sleaford and Lincoln; and I
&s;hould again recommend it to their &s;erious attention.</P>
<P>Another improper &s;ituation for the u&s;e of lime is &s;aid to be on
tho&s;e lands, which are too wet, and which therefore &s;hould be
previou&s;ly drained; otherwi&s;e the lime is &s;aid to coale&s;ce into a
kind of mortar, and become &s;o hard, that the tender plumula of
growing &s;eeds, or the fine extremities of their roots, can not
ea&s;ily penetrate it. This may occur more certainly in that kind
of lime, which contains mangane&s;e, and is therefore capable of
&s;etting under water, as, I &s;uppo&s;e, the barrow lime of Leice&s;ter|&s;hire,
and agnes lime near A&s;hbourn in Derby&s;hire.</P>
<P>7. The great and general advantage of lime in all &s;oils and all
&s;ituations, except &s;ome of tho&s;e which are already replete with
calcareous earth, or are too moi&s;t, can only be under&s;tood from
the idea already mentioned of its &s;upplying actual nutrition to
vegetables; and this &s;eems more probable, as it contributes &s;o
much to the melioration of the crops, as well as to their increa&s;e
in quantity. Wheat from land well limed is believed by farmers,
millers, and bakers, to be, as they &s;uppo&s;e, thinner &s;kinned;
that is, it turns out more and better flour; which I &s;uppo&s;e is
owing its containing more &s;tarch and le&s;s mucilage.</P>
<P>Hence we perceive another very important u&s;e of lime in cul|tivation
of land may be owing to its forwarding the conver&s;ion of
mucilage into &s;tarch, that is to its forwarding the ripening of the
&s;eed; which is a matter of great con&s;equence in this climate of
&s;hort and cold &s;ummers. See Sect. VI. 3. and XVI. 3.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to gra&s;s-ground I am informed, that if a &s;padeful
of lime be thrown on a tu&s;&s;ock, which hor&s;es or cattle have re|fu&s;ed
to eat for years, they will for many &s;ucceeding &s;ea&s;ons
eat it quite clo&s;e to the ground; which is owing, I &s;u&s;pect, to
the gra&s;s containing more &s;ugar in its joints; or to the le&s;s acid|ity
of all its juices.</P>
<P>8. There are not only &s;ome other bodies, which po&s;&s;e&s;s a cal|careous
ba&s;e, be&s;ides the common lime&s;tone, as gyp&s;um, fluor,
<PB N="200" REF="206">
bone-a&s;hes, and perhaps vegetable a&s;hes; but there are others
which are occa&s;ionally united with carbonic acid, and may be de|tached
from it by calcination, as the aerated barytes and magne|&s;ia.
The la&s;t in its calcined &s;tate may po&s;&s;ibly be as u&s;eful in agri|culture
as the lime of calcareous earth, with which I believe it
is frequently mixed. For Mr. Tennant a&s;&s;ured me a few days
ago, that he had analy&s;ed the lime&s;tone of Breedon in Leice&s;ter|&s;hire,
and found it to contain nearly as much magne&s;ia as cal|careous
earth, be&s;ides &s;ome mangane&s;e; which is neverthele&s;s a
lime much e&s;teemed in this country both for architecture and agri|culture.
As magne&s;ia exi&s;ts in &s;ea-water, and in &s;alt &s;prings, it
may render the&s;e waters u&s;eful as a manure as well as the ma|rine
&s;alt, which they contain. As &s;teatites or &s;oap-&s;tone con|&s;i&s;ts
principally of magne&s;ia, perhaps this lime&s;tone of Breedon
may be worth the attention of the porcelain manufactory.</P>
<P>This magne&s;ian lime of Breedon is further worthy attention in
the cultivation of land, and particularly where a &s;oil abounds
with vitriol of iron, or where it abounds with gyp&s;um, as about
Chela&s;ton on the banks of the Derwent, and from Nottingham
to Newark on the banks of the Trent, as the magne&s;ian earth
would unite with the vitriolic acid, and leave an ochre of iron
in one ca&s;e, and lime in the other; at the &s;ame time a &s;oluble
&s;alt, called Ep&s;om &s;alt, would be formed, which, according to
the experiments of Dr. Home, promotes rapid vegetation. To
&s;ow a few pecks of gyp&s;um reduced to powder on gra&s;s land, as
is done in America; and then to &s;ow upon this twice or thrice
as much Breedon lime, might be an experiment which might
be advantageous in the part of Derby&s;hire next to Leice&s;ter|&s;hire,
where both of them are to be obtained at no great ex|pence.</P>

<HEAD>VII. CLAY, METALLIC OXYDES, NITRE, SEA-SALT.</HEAD>
<P>1. The too great adhe&s;ion of the particles of argillaceous
earth or clay renders it in its pure &s;tate unfit for vegetation; as
the tender fibrils of roots can with difficulty penetrate it, whence
it becomes much improved for the purpo&s;es of agriculture, when
it is mixed with calcareous earth and with &s;iliceous &s;and, as
in marle.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="207">
It is commonly believed that lumps of clay become meliorated
by being expo&s;ed to fro&s;t in its moi&s;t &s;tate, which by expanding
the water, which it contains, by converting it into ice is &s;up|po&s;ed
to leave the particles of the clay further from each other.
This however &s;eems in general to be a mi&s;taken idea, &s;ince if the
act of freezing be not very &s;uddenly performed, a contrary effect
&s;eems to occur, as noticed by Mr. Kirwan; who ob&s;erves,
&startq;that clay in its u&s;ual &s;tate of dryne&s;s can ab&s;orb two and a
half times its weight of water without &s;uffering any to drop out,
and retains it in the open air more pertinaciou&s;ly than other
earths; but that in a freezing cold clay contracts more than
other earths &s;queezing out its water, and thus parting with more
of it than other earths.&endq; Mineralogy, Vol. I. p. 9.</P>
<P>This curious circum&s;tance, that water, as it cry&s;tallizes, de|trudes
the clay, which is diffu&s;ed in it, corre&s;ponds with other
facts of congelation. Thus when wine, or vinegar, or common
&s;alt and water, or a &s;olution of blue vitriol in water, are ex|po&s;ed
to fro&s;ty air; the alcohol, the acetuous acid, the marine
&s;alt, and the calx of copper, are all of them detruded from the
aqueous cry&s;tals, and retreat to the central part of the fluid, or
to that la&s;t frozen, or into numerous cells &s;urrounded with par|titions
of ice, as I have frequently ob&s;erved; whence it appears,
that wet clay is in general rendered more &s;olid and tenacious by
being frozen, as well as when it is dried, and its moi&s;ture ex|haled
by too warm a &s;un; and by both tho&s;e circum&s;tances be|comes
le&s;s adapted to the purpo&s;es of agriculture.</P>
<P>2. In mo&s;t clays a kind of efferve&s;cence occurs, after they
are turned over, and thrown on heaps, and thus acquire air
into their inte&s;tines, which renders them much fitter for the pur|po&s;es
of vitrification; and thus forwards the proce&s;&s;es of the
brick-kiln and pottery. This greater facility to vitrify is proba|bly
effected by the union of oxygen with the iron, which mo&s;t
clays contain; as oxydes of lead and mangane&s;e are u&s;ed in the
more perfect vitrifications.</P>
<P>The calciform ores, or oxydes, of iron, mangane&s;e, and zinc,
are frequently found near the &s;urface of the earth, where they
have been united with oxygen by the pa&s;&s;ing currents of the at|mo&s;phere;
and have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have originated from the
<PB N="202" REF="208">
decompo&s;ition of vegetables and animal bodies, as mentioned in
Botanic Garden, Vol. I. additional note 18. Iron has been
detected in all vegetable and animal matters, mangane&s;e in &s;ome
of them; and, if we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a te&s;t for di&s;covering &s;uch minute
particles of zinc, as the magnet di&s;covers of iron, it is probable,
that zinc al&s;o would be detected in the vegetables, which grow
over its beds.</P>
<P>As &s;ome philo&s;ophers have lately contended for the great uti|lity
of oxygen in vegetation, as Humboldt and Von U&s;lar;
who affirm from their experiments, that hyper-oxygenated mu|riatic
acid u&s;ed in &s;mall quantities promotes both the growth and
irritability of plants; there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the calci|form
ores of iron, mangane&s;e, and zinc, as well as minium,
and other calces or oxydes of metals made by fire, and even
burnt clays, when &s;trewed on the ground, may contribute to ve|getation
by their parting with their abundant oxygen in a fluid
not in a ga&s;&s;eous form; which uniting with carbon, or pho&s;pho|rus,
or nitrogen, without emitting perceptible heat or light,
might supply nutritious fluids to the roots of vegetables; further
experiments are wanted on this &s;ubject. But I am well informed,
that a red ochre of iron, called raddle, has been u&s;ed on &s;ome
lands with advantage in the north of Stafford&s;hire; and &s;hould
recommend a trial of mangane&s;e in no&s;e counties, where it
abounds, as near King&s;bury, and near Ather&s;tone in Warwick|&s;hire;
and a trial of lapis calaminaris, where it abounds, as near
Matlock in Derbyshire; and even of the calciform ore of lead,
which is found in Angle&s;ey, and on the top of &s;ome other lead
mines.</P>
<P>M. Humboldt a&s;&s;erts, that he mixed many &s;eeds into a kind of
pa&s;te with the black oxyde of mangane&s;e, and poured over it the
muriatic acid diluted with water, in the proportion of about &s;ix
of water to one of acid; and that much oxygen was thus di&s;en|gaged,
and occa&s;ioned quick vegetation. Journal de Phy&s;ique,
1798. See No. 2. 8. of this Section.</P>
<P>3. When clays are turned up with the &s;pade, as is u&s;ual
in preparing them for the brick-kiln, a kind of efferve&s;cence
occurs, as mentioned above; which is probably owing to the
e&s;cape of the azote of the air impri&s;oned in the inter&s;tices,
<PB N="203" REF="209">
as the oxygen unites with &s;ome metallic particles in the
clay; or to &s;team rai&s;ed from the water in the clay by the heat
&s;et at liberty from the combination of the oxygen and the iron.
This union of oxygen with iron is curiou&s;ly almo&s;t vi&s;ible in
many granates or porphyries; which I have &s;een thinly &s;cattered
in large nodules near Cannock in Stafford&s;hire, in the road from
Lichfield to Shrew&s;bury; and on breaking them have ob&s;erved
no appearance of iron on the newly divided &s;urfaces; but which
in a few days acquired an ochery appearance on them, which pe|netrated
nearly half an inch. This can not but be a&s;cribed to
the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere having united with the iron in
the&s;e &s;tones, which by their &s;mell, when breathed upon, contain
indurated clay, and having converted into an oxyde either the
clay it&s;elf, or &s;ome metallic particles included in it.</P>
<P>There is neverthele&s;s an exhalation from clay, and perhaps
from mo&s;t &s;oils, when they have been previou&s;ly dried, and then
&s;prinkled with water, as after a &s;hower in &s;ummer, which has
been &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;alubrious to invalids and convale&s;cents. This
remarkably occurs when dry clay is breathed upon even in its mo&s;t
indurated &s;tate as in granites and porphyries, by which criterion
the&s;e &s;tones are immediately di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;iliceous and
calcareous ones. This I imagine is produced by the heat &s;et at
liberty by the combination of dry clay and water, like that pro|duced
in &s;o much greater degree by the combination of lime and
water; and that this heat rai&s;es a part of the acquired moi&s;ture
into &s;team, in which are di&s;&s;olved the odorous particles; both
which probably cau&s;e the quick vegetation on clayey &s;oils after
the &s;howers in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>When marl, which con&s;i&s;ts of clay, calcareous earth, and
&s;and, which are frequently coloured red by iron, or blue pro|bably
by mangane&s;e, is expo&s;ed in &s;mall lumps to the atmo&s;|phere;
it is liable to crumble into powder, which I &s;uppo&s;e to
ari&s;e from a &s;imilar circum&s;tance; that the oxygen of the at|mo&s;phere
uniting with the clay, or the metallic particles it
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, lets at liberty the &s;ame gas, or &s;team, which is &s;een
to ri&s;e from clay, when thrown on heaps for the brick-kiln or
pottery; which breaks the lumps into powder, as the lumps of
lime are broken into powder by the &s;team, which is generated
<PB N="204" REF="210">
when water is thrown on them, by the heat &s;et at liberty by
the combination of the lime and water.</P>
<P>This union of oxygen with the clay, or with the metallic
particles mingled with it, I &s;uppo&s;e to be much facilitated by
expo&s;ing it to a red heat, as in burning bricks; while a greater
heat may unite &s;o much oxygen with it as to turn it into gla&s;s.
Exactly &s;uch a proce&s;s occurs in the production of minium; a
certain quantity of heat with the contact of air combines &s;o
much oxygen with the melted lead, as to form an oxyde; a
greater quantity of heat converts it into gla&s;s.</P>
<P>4. When clay is united with &s;o much oxygen by fire as to
form a &s;oft or imperfect brick, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of promot|ing
the generation of the nitrous acid in certain &s;ituations;
which is frequently &s;een like an efflore&s;cence on mouldering
walls, having become by the addition of lime a calcareous nitre.
The u&s;e of the&s;e &s;oft bricks in the production of nitre is well
known in Paris, where the rubbi&s;h of old hou&s;es is regularly
purcha&s;ed for that purpo&s;e; which before the revolution was a
royal manufacture.</P>
<P>As the&s;e &s;oft efflore&s;cent bricks from old hou&s;es are known
powerfully to promote vegetation, when pulverized and mixed
with the &s;oil; at the &s;ame time that they are capable of pro|ducing
the nitrous acid; I imagine, that the u&s;e of paring and
burning the turf of &s;ome newly enclo&s;ed commons depends on
this circum&s;tance. That is, that the heat emitted from the
burning vegetable fibres unites oxygen with the clay; which
latter forms more than half of the &s;lices of turf, as they are dug
from the ground. In other re&s;pects the paring and burning of
gra&s;s grounds would certainly be a wa&s;teful procedure; as much
carbon is converted into carbonic acid, and di&s;per&s;ed along with
the uninflamed &s;moke or &s;oot, and nothing left but the vegeta|ble
a&s;hes. From the&s;e con&s;iderations it would probably be
worthy experiment in farms, where coal and clay abound, to
burn the latter to a certain degree; which might &s;upply an ex|hau&s;tle&s;s
&s;ource of profitable manure.</P>
<P>5. I have &s;u&s;pected al&s;o, that this calcined clay, as it exi&s;ts
in &s;oft bricks, has a power of decompo&s;ing marine &s;alt, as I
once ob&s;erved in a cellar, where beef had been long &s;alted on
<PB N="205" REF="211">
one &s;ide of a nine-inch wall, the wooden &s;alting-tub for which
was attached to it; that a great efflore&s;cence appeared on the
other &s;ide of the wall, which I believed to be fo&s;&s;ile alkali or
natron. If this idea be ju&s;t, the &s;oft bricks from old buildings,
or clays &s;o far purpo&s;ely burnt, may in this manner be &s;ervice|able
to vegetation, by &s;eparating the fo&s;&s;ile alkali from the &s;ea-&s;alt,
which is wa&s;hed from decompo&s;ing animal and vegetable
&s;ub&s;tances; which by converting carbon into an hepar carbonis,
as lime is &s;uppo&s;ed to do in No. 6. 1. of this &s;ection, might
render it &s;oluble in water, and capable of being ab&s;orbed by the
lymphatic ve&s;&s;els of the roots of plants.</P>
<P>If clay calcined to a certain degree, and thus united with
oxygen, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of decompo&s;ing marine &s;alt, there
is rea&s;on to believe, when it is more &s;lowly united with oxygen
by its expo&s;ure to the atmo&s;phere by the &s;pade or plough, that
it may po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame property; and that this may have given
ri&s;e to the very contradictory reports concerning the u&s;e of &s;ea-&s;alt
in agriculture; as it may probably be of great advantage to
clayey &s;oils, but perhaps not &s;o to other &s;oils. See Sect. XIV.
2. 8.</P>
<P>6. Another &s;aline body, which readily unites with argilla|ceous
earth in the fire, is &s;alt of urine, commonly called micro|co&s;mic
&s;alt, which acts as a flux di&s;&s;olving clay with con&s;ider|able
efferve&s;cence. Kirwan's Mineralogy, Vol. I. p. 9. This
microco&s;mic &s;alt con&s;i&s;ts of pho&s;phoric acid united with an am|monical,
or with a calcareous ba&s;e; and mu&s;t in the latter ca&s;e
re&s;emble the pho&s;phat of lime, of which there are whole moun|tains
di&s;covered in Spain, as mentioned in No. 5. 5. of this
&s;ection; and of which many may probably be di&s;covered in our
own country. Now as the &s;ame combinations of matter, which
are quickly formed by the heat of the chemi&s;t's furnaces, are
often performed, though more &s;lowly, in the elaboratory of
nature; it is probable, that if this calcareous pho&s;phorus could
be procured in this country, reduced to powder and &s;pread on
our clay lands, that it might more than any other calcareous
matter render them friendly to vegetation, like the a&s;hes of
burnt bones; which experiment alone can determine.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="212">
7. As clay is le&s;s adapted to the growth of the roots of
plants by the too great cohe&s;ion of its particles, this may be in
&s;ome degree corrected by frequently expo&s;ing it to air impri&s;on|ed
in its inter&s;tices, as by turning it over by the plough or &s;pade.
Another method is by planting on it &s;uch vegetables fir&s;t as are
known to grow well in clay, as beans, and as their roots are
afterwards left in the clay, they not only thus form tubes in it,
&s;o as to render the ma&s;s le&s;s cohe&s;ive; but add to it &s;o much
carbon, and thus rather enrich than impoveri&s;h it. Add to this
that the lower leaves of the den&s;e foliage of the&s;e vigorous vege|tables
are believed to give out much carbonic acid by their re&s;pi|ration
in the &s;hade &s;imilar to the re&s;piration of animals; which
perpetually &s;inking down upon the &s;urface of the &s;oil is believed
to &s;upply it with carbon; and thus al&s;o to render it more nutri|tive
to other vegetables, which may afterwards grow upon it.</P>
<P>Lord Kaimes, who allows that clay, if it be moi&s;tened after
it has been pulverized, becomes on drying as indurated and
cohe&s;ive as before, a&s;&s;erts, that this does not happen, if it be
moi&s;tened with the fluid, which e&s;capes from dunghills; which
may be owing both to the carbon, and to the fixed vegetable
alkali, which that fluid contains. And al&s;o adds, that lime
will prevent the cohe&s;ion or induration of clay, and therefore
greatly improves argillaceous &s;oils for all the purpo&s;es of agri|culture.</P>
<P>8. When clay abounds with vitriolic acid &s;o as to be con|verted
into alnm, it becomes very unfriendly to vegetation. In
this &s;tate it is believed much to counteract the proce&s;s of putre|faction
in animal bodies, as is &s;aid to have happened in &s;ome
burying grounds. This it may effect by uniting with the ammo|nia
generated by putrefaction the moment it is formed, or by
preventing its production; as when the &s;alt of Neville Holt
water in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, which I &s;uppo&s;e is alum, is mixed with
very putrid blood, as I once witne&s;&s;ed, the putrid fcent was
in&s;tantly de&s;troyed, as I &s;uppo&s;e the argillaceous earth was pre|cipitated.</P>
<P>Where this acid or aluminous clay abounds, it is believed to
check the vegetation of trees as well as of herbaceous plants by
eroding the fine extremities of their roots, as mentioned in
<PB N="207" REF="213">
Sect. II. 9. which is perhaps be&s;t to be remedied in gardens by
wood-a&s;hes or &s;oap-&s;uds, and in larger fields by mixing lime, or
chalk in powder, or the &s;weepings from roads, which are re|paired
by lime&s;tone, with the&s;e aluminous clays. Or la&s;tly,
where it can be procured, by mixing with them &s;uch lime as
that of Breedon in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, which con&s;i&s;ts of equal parts
of magne&s;ia and calcareous earth, which would thus fabricate
what has been termed Ep&s;om &s;alt, which is &s;aid to be friendly
to vegetation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>VIII. MANURES BY SPONTANEOUS DECOMPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>We &s;hall now con&s;ider more generally the decompo&s;ition of
organized matter, which vegetable and animal bodies &s;ponta|neou&s;ly
undergo, when they cea&s;e to live. The proce&s;&s;es of
this decompo&s;ition have commonly been divided into the vinous,
acetous, and putrefactive fermentations; which have been &s;up|po&s;ed
uniformly to &s;ucceed each other. But it is more proba|ble,
that different kinds or parts of dead organized matter may
be &s;ubject to many different kinds of chemical changes, and that
the&s;e may vary with the degrees of heat, and the quantity of
water, and of air, with which they are &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>1. In the &s;tomachs of animals &s;accharine proce&s;s precedes
the vinous fermentation; which la&s;t only occurs, when the ani|mal
power of dige&s;tion or ab&s;orption is for a time &s;u&s;pended.
A &s;imilar proce&s;s occurs in the germination of vegetable roots,
whereby meal is converted into &s;ugar, as in the malt-hou&s;e;
and in the gradual ripening of apples and pears, after they
are plucked from the tree; but all the&s;e may be &s;aid to be
&s;till alive; and this change of meal or of mucilage into &s;ugar
may thus be e&s;teemed a vegetable rather than a chemical pro|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>The art of cookery, by expo&s;ing vegetable and animal &s;ub|&s;tances
to heat, has contributed to increa&s;e the quantity of the
food of mankind by converting the acerb juices of &s;ome fruits
into &s;ugar, as in the baking of unripe pears, and the brui&s;ing of
unripe apples; in both which &s;ituations the life of the vegetable
is de&s;troyed, and the conver&s;ion of the har&s;h juice into a &s;weet
<PB N="208" REF="214">
one mu&s;t be performed by a chemical proce&s;s; and not by a
vegetable one only, as the germination of barley in making malt
has generally been &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some large round au&s;tere pears were ye&s;terday, November
20, &s;hewn me after having been nine hours in the oven behind
a kitchen fire covered &s;ome inches with water in a &s;team-pot.
On ta&s;ting them they were &s;weet, and &s;oft, and appeared to
have had at lea&s;t the heat of boiling water. They were replac|ed
in the oven, and kept in it twelve hours longer; and then
became nearly as &s;weet as &s;yrup or treacle; which might in
part have been occa&s;ioned by the evaporation of half the water.
From this curious circum&s;tance there &s;eems rea&s;on to conclude,
that in a degree of heat about that of boiling water the &s;accha|rine
proce&s;s may &s;ucceed; and at the &s;ame time that the proce&s;s
of fermentation may be prevented from exi&s;ting; which I hope
may induce &s;ome chemical philo&s;opher to inve&s;tigate by experi|ments
this curious and important &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Some circum&s;tances, which &s;eem to injure the life of &s;everal
fruits, &s;eem to forward the &s;accharine proce&s;s of their juices.
Thus if &s;ome kinds of pears are gathered a week before they
would ripen on the tree, and are laid on a heap and covered,
their juice becomes &s;weet many days &s;ooner. The taking off a
circular piece of the bark from a branch of a pear-tree cau&s;es
the fruit of that branch to ripen &s;ooner by a fortnight, as I
have more than once ob&s;erved. The wounds made in apples
by in&s;ects occa&s;ion tho&s;e apples to ripen &s;ooner; caprification,
or the piercing of figs, in the i&s;land of Malta, is &s;aid to ripen
them &s;ooner; and I am well informed, that when bunches of
grapes in this country have acquired their expected &s;ize, that
if the &s;talk of each bunch be cut half through, they will &s;ooner
ripen.</P>
<P>The germinating barley in the malt-hou&s;e I believe acquire
not half its &s;weetne&s;s, till the life of the &s;eed is de&s;troyed; and
the &s;accharine proce&s;s then continued or advanced by the heat
in drying it; though I have lately been informed that &s;ome
grains of malt will vegetate after having been dried in the u&s;ual
manner, which however may have been owing to their not hav+ing
been previously &s;uffered perfectly to germinate. Thus in
<PB N="209" REF="215">
animal dige&s;tion the &s;ugar produced in the &s;tomach is ab&s;orbed
by the lacteals, as fa&s;t as it is made; otherwi&s;e it ferments and
produces flatulency; &s;o in the germination of barley in the malt-hou&s;e
&s;o long as the new plant lives, the &s;ugar I &s;uppo&s;e is ab|&s;orbed,
as fa&s;t as it is made; but that which we u&s;e in making
beer is the &s;ugar produced by a chemical proce&s;s after the death
of the young plant, or which is made more expeditiou&s;ly than
the plant can ab&s;orb it.</P>
<P>It is probable this &s;accharine proce&s;s, which obtains in new
hay-&s;tacks too ha&s;tily; and which by immediately running into
fermentation produces &s;o much heat as to &s;et them on fire. The
greate&s;t part of the grain, or &s;eeds, or roots, u&s;ed in the di&s;|tilleries,
as wheat, canary &s;eed, potatoes, are not I believe
previou&s;ly &s;ubjected to germination; but are in part by a che|mical
proce&s;s converted into &s;ugar, and immediately, &s;ubjected
to vinous fermentation. And it is probable, a proce&s;s may
&s;ometime be di&s;covered of producing &s;ugar from &s;tarch or meal;
and of &s;eparating it from them for dome&s;tic purpo&s;es by alcohol;
which di&s;&s;olves &s;ugar but not mucilage; or by other means.</P>
<P>This then may be termed the &s;accharine fermentation, and
may exi&s;t I &s;uppo&s;e beneath or upon the earth in the beginning
of &s;ome &s;pontaneous vegetable decompo&s;itions, previous to the
vinous fermentation; and may &s;upply thus a very nutritive ma|terial
to vegetation; &s;imilar to that which the embryon plants in
the &s;eeds of many fruit-trees acquire from their fruits; and to
that, which the embryons in many farinaceous &s;eeds acquire
from the &s;pontaneous change of the meal in their cotyledons;
though perhaps in le&s;s quantity and purity.</P>
<P>2. A &s;econdary proce&s;s to this I &s;uppo&s;e to be the vinous
fermentation, in which much carbon becomes united to oxygen;
and probably at the very in&s;tant of their combination, while
they are yet in the form of a liquid, and not of a gas, they be|come
ab&s;orbed by the roots of plants. The heat, which is
perceived in the hotbeds, which are u&s;ed for the growth of
cucumbers and melona, is produced by this union of oxygen and
carbon, or by the generation of &s;ome other acids, as of pho&s;|phorus,
or nitre.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="216">
That this heat is owing to the atmo&s;pheric air combining with
&s;ome inflammable ba&s;e, and producing acidity of &s;ome kind,
appears from the following experiment. A few years ago, a
gardener told me that a hot-bed, which he had made of tan|ner's
bark with $ome hor&s;e dung and &s;traw, was become too cold
for the growth of his pots of cucumbers. He was de&s;ired &s;imply
to turn over the bed, and &s;hake every part of it in the air with
his fork, as he lightly replaced it. This was complied with,
and in a few days I ob&s;erved by touching a &s;tick, which had
for &s;ome hours been in&s;erted into it, that it had acquired the
u&s;ual heat of a hot-bed.</P>
<P>This addition of heat was doubtle&s;s acquired from the air,
which was recently included in the inter&s;tices of the bed by its
being turned over, broken into &s;mall pieces, and expo&s;ed to the
atmo&s;phere; whence new acids &s;eem to have been generated,
and carbon, and perhaps pho&s;phorus and nitrogen, rendered
&s;oluble in water. Great heat is produced from the union of
oxygen with tho&s;e ba&s;es of acidity, which in large &s;tacks of
new hay is often known to excite real combu&s;tion; the violent
fermentation of which may be partly owing to the &s;ugar which
is depo&s;ited in the joints of gra&s;s before the &s;eeds are ripe for
their nouri&s;hment, and partly to a chemical production of &s;ugar,
as above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>3. In the putrefactive proce&s;s carbon is not only converted
into carbonic acid, as above related; but there appears to be a
decompo&s;ition of water, as is known by the &s;mell of hydroge$$
and it is probable, this inflammable body may unite with car|bon,
as in hydrocarbonate gas, and thus render them both &s;o|luble
in water, and ab&s;orbable by the ve&s;&s;els of vegetable roots,
without their pa&s;&s;ing into an acid or ga&s;&s;eous form, and may
much contribute to the nutriment of vegetables.</P>
<P>4. There al&s;o appears at the end of the putrefactive proc$$s
to be a junction of azote with oxygen producing the acid of
nitre, which probably may contribute much to promote vegeta|tion.
This appears from the mode of procuring that acid in
France and Pru&s;&s;ia, and which might be &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed
under every &s;hed in our own farm-yards; as it con&s;i&s;ts i$ a
due mixture of vegetable and animal recrements with &s;oil, fre|quently
<PB N="211" REF="217">
turned over to expo&s;e it to the air, while it is defended
by a &s;hed from the &s;un&s;hine and rain; which is thus at the &s;ame
time adapted to produce the quicke&s;t vegetation, and to gene|rate
the nitrous acid.</P>
<P>The oxygen, which compo&s;es nitrous acid, is believed to
adhere more weakly to its ba&s;e the azote, than in the compo&s;i|tion
of other acids. On this account it &s;o readily explodes by
its junction with carbon in a given degree of heat. This loo&s;e
adherence of the oxygen in nitrous acid, like that of hyper-oxy|genated
marine acid, and of the oxygen in the ore of mangane&s;e,
and of &s;ome other metallic oxydes, may adapt them to promote
vegetation by their more readily parting with this material &s;o
e&s;&s;ential in the compo&s;ition of plants.</P>
<P>5. From the above ob&s;ervations it appears, that when the
&s;oil is turned over by the &s;pade or plough, and thus acquires
atmo&s;pheric air in its inter&s;tices, and in con&s;equence becomes
warm by the production of new acids, that the &s;eeds or plants
&s;hould be in&s;erted as &s;oon as convenient, for the purpo&s;e of
their receiving the mo&s;t &s;alutary effect of tho&s;e operations.
Nor &s;hould this be ob&s;erved only in black garden mould, or
well manured glebes, where carbon or pho&s;phorus may be &s;up|po&s;ed
to abound, and a proper di&s;po&s;ition for the production of
the nitrous acid, but in tho&s;e clays al&s;o which are pure enough
for the brick-kiln or the pottery.</P>

<HEAD>IX. MANURES BY CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>The u&s;e of fire and water contributes to increa&s;e the nouri&s;h|ment
of mankind by rendering many vegetable materials inno|cuous,
and others dige&s;table in the animal &s;tomach; and &s;eems
particularly efficacious in promoting the &s;accharine proce&s;s, and
in producing mucilage from gri&s;tles, horn, hair, and perhaps
even from bones by means of Papin's dige&s;ter. Whether this
art could be advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of rendering
manures capable of being ab&s;orbed by vegetable roots in a &s;tate
of le&s;s decompo&s;ition, than by the &s;low proce&s;s of putrefaction,
is a que&s;tion of curio&s;ity and utility.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="218">
Sugar and mucilage are certainly ab&s;orbed by vegetables
without their being re&s;olved into the elements, from which they
were compo&s;ed; as appears in the &s;ap-juice which flows from
the wounds of birch and maple trees in the vernal months;
which I am informed will pa&s;s into fermentation and produce
wine; a proce&s;s which &s;ome modern chemi&s;t affirms cannot be
effected by &s;ugar alone without the addition of mucilage. The
ab&s;orption of mucilage &s;eems to occur in the germination of
many &s;eeds, as of barley; a part of the meal of the cotyledon is
evidently converted into &s;ugar, but another part of it is probably
ab&s;orbed in the form of mucilage; &s;ome of which oozes on
breaking the plumula; and in the growth of tho&s;e &s;eeds, which
contain oil, as in almond, hemp, rape, and line-&s;eed, it is pro|bable,
a part of the undecompo&s;ed oil may be ab&s;orbed by the
umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the embryons in tho&s;e &s;eeds.</P>
<P>It hence &s;eems credible, that by the u&s;e of heat and water
the art of cookery might furni&s;h mucilage, &s;ugar, and oil, from
vegetable or animal materials; which might be converted into
&s;ap-juice or chyle, without their being previou&s;ly reduced into
their elements; and might thus facilitate the more luxuriant
growth of plants, as they contribute more to fatten animals,
than materials of le&s;s combination.</P>
<P>2. To this might be added, that the putrefactive proce&s;s may
be forwarded by heat in &s;ome materials by de&s;troying the life of
the material; as in roa&s;ting apples and pears, and in killing the
roots of potatoes, or the &s;eeds of corn, Thus Mr. D&mdash;,
a friend of mine, had twenty &s;trikes of potatoes, which he
wi&s;hed to dry on a malt-kiln, hoping to render them more like
the meal of wheat, and better to pre&s;erve them during the &s;um|mer-months.
Whether they were &s;ufficiently dried he did not
attend to; but they were carried into a granary, and laid on
heaps; and in a week or two became &s;o putrid, that the &s;mell
was in&s;ufferable, his &s;wine refu&s;ed to eat them, and he was
obliged to add them to the manure of the dunghill.</P>
<P>That potatoes, which have undergone a certain degree of heat,
contribute more to fatten all kinds of animals, ari&s;es from the
acrimony of their rinds being de&s;troyed, and from their au&s;tere
juices being converted into mucilage, and perhaps a part of their
<PB N="213" REF="219">
mucilage into &s;tarch, and are hence ready for the &s;accharine and
oily proce&s;&s;es of animal dige&s;tion. A very convenient method
of expo&s;ing them to &s;team is de&s;cribed in a late ingenious publi|cation
of the Agricultural Society. A &s;mall boiler is &s;et in
brick work under a &s;hed, &s;o that the flame of wood or coal may
pa&s;s &s;pirally round it. It &s;hould be covered with a double lid
of tin or wood to prevent much heat from e&s;caping; and may
have a &s;and-joint to keep the &s;team in, or a little moi&s;t clay, or
even a wet flannel put circularly round the cover may an&s;wer
this purpose.</P>
<P>Near this furnace is to be fixed a large barrel on one of its
ends, with a cover on the other end; which may be occa&s;ionally
opened to admit potatoes, and clo&s;ed again &s;o as to confine the
&s;team, which is to be derived into it from the boiler by a double
pipe one within the other, of tin or wood, about two inches
in diameter. By the&s;e means a large quantity of potatoes may
be rendered much more nutritive to animals, and I &s;uppo&s;e to
vegetables (if they were u&s;ed as manure), as they may thus
probably be ab&s;orbed by their lacteals or lymphatics without
being &s;o much decompo&s;ed as by the putrefactive proce&s;s; and
thus produce nutriment in le&s;s time, and by le&s;s labour of di|ge&s;tion.</P>
<P>If the &s;team could be made hotter than boiling water, which
po&s;&s;ibly may in the ve&s;&s;el above de&s;cribed, if the water in it
ri&s;es but a few inches, and the &s;team after it is produced; is
heated above 212 degrees by the &s;ides of the boiler above the
water, round which the flame plays &s;pirally, the &s;team thus
made hotter might probably render the potatoes more mucila|ginous
or more &s;tarchy.</P>
<P>3. A &s;till more effectual method of di&s;&s;olving hard vegetable
and animal &s;ub&s;tances, and rendering them nutritive, might be
by dige&s;ting them for &s;ome time in water rai&s;ed to a much greater
heat than that of boiling. This is to be done in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el,
called Papin's dige&s;ter; in which it is &s;aid, that the confined
water may be made red hot; and will then di&s;&s;olve hair, horns,
hoofs, bones, tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, and all animal, and perhaps many
vegetable matters; which might thus facilitate their decompo|&s;ition
<PB N="214" REF="220">
for the purpo&s;es of manures, or for the nutriment of many
animals; and might even contribute to the food of mankind in
times of &s;carcity. This ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be made of iron, and
&s;hould have an oval opening at top, with an oval lid of iron
larger than the aperture. This lid &s;hould be &s;lipped in end|ways,
when the ve&s;&s;el is filled, and then turned, and rai&s;ed by
a &s;crew above it into contact with the under edges of the aper|ture.
There &s;hould al&s;o be a &s;mall tube or hole covered with
a weighted valve to prevent the danger of bur&s;ting the dige&s;ter.</P>
<P>4. Other materials might be rendered more ea&s;ily dige&s;tible,
and thence more nutritive to animals, and perhaps to plants, by
mechanic trituration as well as by cookery; if the labour and
expence were not too great; as the grinding of gra&s;&s;es, &s;traws,
and farinaceous &s;eeds into powder between mill-&s;tones; which
have been called the artificial teeth of &s;ociety. It is probable,
that &s;ome &s;oft kinds of wood ground into powder, and e&s;pe|cially
when they have undergone a kind of fermentation, and
become of loo&s;er texture, or boiled to de&s;troy their acrimony,
might be rendered u&s;eful food for &s;wine or hor&s;es, and even for
mankind in times of famine.</P>
<P>Nor is it improbable, that hay, which has been kept in &s;tacks,
&s;o as to undergo the &s;accharine proce&s;s, may be &s;o managed by
grinding and by fermentation with yea&s;t like bread, as to &s;erve
in part for the &s;u&s;tenance of mankind in times of great &s;carcity.
Dr. Prie&s;tley gave to a cow for &s;ome time a &s;trong infu&s;ion of
hay in large quantity for her drink, and found, that &s;he pro|duced
during this treatment above double the quantity of milk.
Hence if bread cannot be made from ground hay, there is great
rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that a nutritive beverage may be thus prepared
either in its &s;accharine &s;tate, or fermented into a kind of beer.</P>
<P>It may be here ob&s;erved, that it is believed by &s;ome, that
feeding hor&s;es with ground corn, as with the flour of beans or
oats, does not &s;trengthen them nearly &s;o much as by giving them
the &s;ame quantity of oats or beans whole. Parkin&s;on, Exper.
Farmer, Vol. I. p. 227. It is a&s;&s;erted al&s;o that &s;oup, with the
fle&s;h-meat boiled down into a fluid ma&s;s, will give much le&s;s
&s;trength to a man, than he would acquire by eating the &s;olid meat,
<PB N="215" REF="221">
of which the &s;oup was made. The rea&s;on of both the&s;e &s;eems
to ari&s;e from the &s;aliva being well mixed with the ma&s;ticated
food, and in greater quantity; which therefore becomes more
animalized aliment, than that di&s;&s;olved in water alone, and is
more ea&s;ily converted into nutriment.</P>
<P>In times of great &s;carcity there are other vegetables, which
though not in common u&s;e, would mo&s;t probably afford whole|&s;ome
nouri&s;hment, either by boiling them, or drying and grind|ing
them, or by both tho&s;e proce&s;&s;es in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Of the&s;e are
perhaps the tops and the bark of all tho&s;e vegetables which are
armed with thorns or prickles, as goo&s;eberry-trees, holly, gor&s;e,
and perhaps hawthorn. The inner bark of the elm-tree makes
a kind of gruel. And the roots of fern, and probably very
many other roots, as of gra&s;s and of clover, taken up in winter,
might yield nouri&s;hment either by boiling or baking, and &s;epa|rating
the fibres from the pulp by beating them; or by getting
only the &s;tarch from tho&s;e which po&s;&s;e&s;s an acrid mucilage, as
the white briony.</P>
<P>The grinding of bones to powder has already been applied to
agriculture, and the chopping of woollen rags; and I &s;uppo&s;e
the trituration of alaba&s;ter, and of chalk, and of &s;oft bricks,
and probably of iron ochres, mangane&s;e, and calamy, might
well repay the labour; after a few experiments had been in&s;ti|tuted
to determine the quantity, which &s;hould be &s;trewed on
different &s;oils.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>X. MANURES BY INSECT PROPAGATION.</HEAD>
<P>1. That the continual growth and decay of animal and vege|table
nature increa&s;es the quantity of &s;uch matter, as is fit for
the reproduction of organized bodies, is evinced by the increa&s;|ing
fertility of cultivated countries; &s;ince even in the&s;e a great
quantity of the annual recrements of decompo&s;ed animals and
vegetables are wa&s;hed by rains from the &s;oil, and carried down
the rivers into the ocean; and in many &s;ituations of &s;oil in
Africa and America, which have been but lately cultivated,
there exi&s;ts a wonderful fertility from the aggregate remains of
vegetable and animal bodies; which have for uncounted ages
<PB N="216" REF="222">
ari&s;en and peri&s;hed there; and which have either left mora&s;&s;es,
where they could not part with their &s;uperabundant water; or
a fertile earth, &s;uch as in our gardens and church-yards, where
the declination of the ground was more favourable.</P>
<P>Some countries on the contrary once highly cultivated and
very populous are in proce&s;s of time become de&s;erts of &s;and;
as many parts of Syria, and the di&s;tricts about Palmira, and
Balbec. This has probably been owing to the want of the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
moi&s;ture in tho&s;e warm and &s;andy regions; which was
formerly &s;upplied by artificial derivations of water; but which
cea&s;ed, after their inhabitants were de&s;troyed by war and ty|ranny;
and &s;econdly, to the rapid &s;treams occa&s;ionally poured
over them by the mon&s;oon floods; &s;imilar to tho&s;e which im|poveri&s;h
Aby&s;&s;inia and Nubia, while they fertilize the flat and
&s;howerle&s;s provinces of Egypt.</P>
<P>We might add, that all calcareous &s;trata are now believed to
have been produced by &s;hells depo&s;ited by aquatic animals in the
early ages of the world; and that the materials, which con&s;titute
the &s;trata above them, have afterwards been formed by the re|crements
of terre&s;trial animal and vegetable bodies. Whence it
may be concluded, that vegetables and animals during their
growth increa&s;e the quantity of matter fit for the more nutritive
food of organized bodies, or of that which is le&s;s decompound|ed;
while they mu&s;t at the &s;ame time occa&s;ionally form or ela|borate
a part of the materials, of which they con&s;i&s;t, from the
&s;imple elements of hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, pho&s;phorus,
&s;ulphur, and oxygen; into which modern chemi&s;try has re&s;olv|ed
them by analy&s;is.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, that vegetables can acquire nutrition from water
and air alone with the carbonic acid, which floats in them, ap|pears
by the experiments of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who have nicely
enclo&s;ed the roots of &s;ome plants in pots, and moi&s;tened them
with di&s;tilled water; and from hence we learn an e&s;&s;ential di&s;|tinction
between vegetable and animal nature; the former can
elaborate the two univer&s;al elements of water and air into nutri|tive
juices, whereas the latter is nece&s;&s;itated to &s;eek more com|pound
nutriment, and to live upon the vegetables, which have
produced it.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="223">
2. One method therefore of increa&s;ing manures may be by
repeatedly propagating and de&s;troying vegetable crops; as by
rai&s;ing tho&s;e of quick growth, and ploughing them again into
the &s;oild uring their &s;accharine and mucilaginous &s;tate, before
they ripen their &s;eeds; as of vetches, and buck-wheat; vicia
and polygonum; and thus producing a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of crops by
the partial decompo&s;ition of the preceding ones. And it is
probable that this proce&s;s might be much improved by &s;trewing
lime over the recent vegetables, at the time of ploughing them
in, as is &s;hewn in No. 6. 5. of this Section.</P>
<P>3. Another mode by which vegetable matter may be decom|po&s;ed
in the &s;ummer months, and at the &s;ame time the quantity
of manure increa&s;ed, is by the depredation of in&s;ects, as is &s;een in
wood, which is &s;o far decompo&s;ing as to become tender, and
is then con&s;umed by various kinds of in&s;ects, whether it be bu|ried
beneath the &s;oil, or expo&s;ed to the air. And I &s;u&s;pect, that
the excrement and the bodies of &s;uch in&s;ects would &s;upply more
nutriment to vegetable roots, than if the vegetable recrements
were left to their &s;pontaneous or chemical di&s;&s;olution; as I
&s;uppo&s;e the bitter excrementitious powder in a filbert, and the
well fed maggot, before it erodes its way out, would fertilize
more barren &s;oil than an emul&s;ion of the kernel.</P>
<P>An ingenious ob&s;erver of nature conveyed water on a dung|hill
in the &s;ummer months in &s;uch quantity, as to make a kind
of &s;emi-fluid chaos, for the purpo&s;e of animating the whole
ma&s;s. It became full of in&s;ects, and was u&s;ed in the autumn
as manure, and he believed with much greater powers, than it
would have otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Hence in the &s;ummer months a manure-heap may be advan|tageou&s;ly
&s;upplied with water for the purpo&s;e of encouraging the
propagation and nouri&s;hment of myriads of in&s;ects; but in the
winter &s;ea&s;on it &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to much moi&s;ture: or
that which drains from it &s;hould be derived &s;pontaneou&s;ly on
lower grounds, or conveyed to higher ones by pumps or water
carts; as it probably con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;olution of carbon by means of
vegetable alkali; or of a mixture of it in water by mucilage;
and is thought to fertilize the ground more than the other
parts of the manure heap. In the tran&s;actions of &s;ome provin|cial
<PB N="218" REF="224">
Society there is an account of much fixed vegetable alkali
having been obtained from the evaporation of the water, which
oozed from dunghills; and Mr. Rouelle has ob&s;erved, that
fixed alkali di&s;&s;olves a con&s;iderable quantity of charcoal by fu|&s;ion.
Fourcroy's Elem. of Chemist. Vol. IV. p. 125.</P>
<P>4. Another great &s;ource of in&s;ect-manure may be obtained
from the myriads of &s;mall fi&s;h, by tho&s;e who live near the ocean;
which by mixing them with &s;oil &s;o as to make what it termed
a compo&s;t, will much add to the fertility of the land, on which
it is afterwards &s;pread, more &s;o perhaps than any other material
except the fle&s;h of land-animals. In china it is &s;aid that the
&s;pawn of fi&s;h in the proper &s;ea&s;on is brought to market, and
purcha&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of peopling the floods on their rice
grounds with fi&s;h, part of which becomes large enough to be
fried and eaten by the land cultivator; and the re&s;t &s;erves the
purpo&s;e of fertilizing the &s;oil, when the floods are drawn off,
by their death and con&s;equent decompo&s;ition.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>XI. PRESERVATION OF MANURES.</HEAD>
<P>1. The fertility of all countries depends on the &s;aving and
u&s;ing tho&s;e kinds of matter, which are fit for the reproduction
of organized bodies. There is a proverb in China, that for
this purpo&s;e a wi&s;e man &s;aves even the parings of his nails, and
the clippings of his hair.</P>
<P>One great wa&s;te of manure in this country, and in mo&s;t
others, is from the frequent rains wa&s;hing down the diffu&s;ible
and &s;oluble parts of the &s;oil into the muddy rivers; &s;o that every
flood from &s;udden &s;howers carries into the &s;ea many thou&s;and
pounds worth of the matter of fertility; and thus dimini&s;hes &s;o
much the food of terre&s;trial animals, however it may add to the
&s;u&s;tenance of marine ones. The Delta of Egypt, and a di&s;trict
in South America near the foot of the Andes mentioned by
Ulloa, are &s;aid by the &s;ituation of the &s;urrounding country to
be free from rain, though they have frequent dews; and to this
circum&s;tance they may in part owe their increa&s;ing fertility.</P>
<P>In this country the &s;now-floods, which occur after a conti|nued
fro&s;t, are le&s;s injurious than tho&s;e from rains; as the
<PB N="219" REF="225">
&s;treams of water from the upper &s;urface of the di&s;&s;olving ice
flows over the under &s;urface of it not yet di&s;&s;olved; and the &s;oil
is not agitated as in rain by the percu&s;&s;ion of the de&s;cending
drops; in&s;omuch that in &s;now-floods the rivers are &s;carcely
muddy; whence the&s;e floods may be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed from
land-floods by the eye, and are much le&s;&s; injurious.</P>
<P>Great attention &s;hould therefore be &s;hewn to the preventing
&s;mall &s;howers from wa&s;hing away the &s;oluble parts of good &s;oil.
For this purpo&s;e all hills &s;hould be ploughed horizontally, and
not in a&s;cending and de&s;cending furrows. De&s;cending plains
of gra&s;s-ground might al&s;o be laid with horizontal ridges and
depre&s;sions; by which management &s;howers will lie a few hours
in the horizontal furrows or depre&s;sions, and either exhale or
&s;oak into the ground; and in very wet &s;ea&s;ons the&s;e may ea&s;ily
by the &s;pade be opened into each other, if the water is found
to lie too long upon them, &s;o as to produce too much cold by
its evaporation, or too great &s;oftne&s;s by its ab&s;orption into the
&s;oil.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, The manures of towns and cities, which are all
now left buried in deep wells, or carried away by &s;oughs into
the rivers, &s;hould be removed by a police, which is &s;aid to
exist in China; and carried out of towns at &s;tated intervals of
time for the purpo&s;es of agriculture; which might be performed
in the night, as is done in Edinburgh; or by means of large
bason&s; or re&s;ervoirs at the extremities of the common &s;hores, or
&s;oughs for the reception of the manure, before it is wa&s;hed into
rivers. See Emba&s;&s;y to China by &s;ir G. Staunton, Vol. III.
p. 308, 8vo. edit.</P>
<P>It has been believed by &s;ome writers in the American Medi|cal
Repo&s;itory, that the pe&s;tilential fever, which has of late in|fe&s;ted
that country, was in part produced or propagated by the
filth of the &s;treets of New York. Dr. S. L. Mitchill adds to his
chemical remarks on manures, &startq;it mu&s;t be welcome intelli|gence,
that the collected ma&s;s of nui&s;ance, which we are now
with &s;uch happy &s;ucce&s;s engaged in removing from the city of
New York, is convertible by the powers of vegetation from
poi&s;on to whole&s;ome articles of food; and thus the purity and
<PB N="220" REF="226">
healthine&s;s of the towns may contribute to the thriftine&s;s and
wealth of the &s;urrounding country. Medical Journal, No. I.</P>
<P>3. Thirdly, there &s;hould be no burial places in churches or
in church-yards, where the monuments of departed &s;inners
&s;houlder God's altar, pollute his holy places with dead men's
bones, and produce by putrid exhalations contagious di&s;ea&s;es
among tho&s;e who frequent his wor&s;hip. But proper burial
grounds &s;hould be con&s;ecrated out of towns, and divided into
two compartments, the earth from one of which, &s;aturated with
animal decompo&s;ition, &s;hould be taken away once in ten or
twenty years, for the purpo&s;es of agriculture; and &s;and or clay,
or le&s;s fertile &s;oil, brought into its place.</P>
<P>A great ri&s;e of the &s;oil, from the remains of the bodies en|tombed
in it, is &s;een round the churches of almo&s;t all populous
towns; &s;o as to have rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cend by &s;eve|ral
&s;teps into tho&s;e churches, which were originally built &s;o as
to require &s;teps to a&s;cend into them; as may frequently be &s;een
by the ba&s;e of the architecture. Nor would the removal of this
earth, if the few bones, which might be found, were again bu|ried
for a further decompo&s;ition, be likely to &s;hock the relations
of the decea&s;ed; as the &s;uper&s;tition concerning the earth, from
which we ro&s;e, and into which we return, has gradually vani&s;h|ed
before the light of rea&s;on; as occured about thirty years ago
in removing much rich earth from the clo&s;e of the cathedral at
Lichfield, and more lately in changing a burying ground at
Shrew&s;bury; both which were executed without &s;uper&s;titious
terror, or popular commotion.</P>
<P>4. Fourthly, a great wa&s;te of the materials of fertility occurs
in all countries, and cannot ea&s;ily be avoided, in the con&s;ump|tion
by fire of &s;o much wood in&s;tead of coal. Whence the
mucilage, and other nutritious juices, which exi&s;t in the fire|wood,
are decompo&s;ed into their elements; and the carbon
united with the oxygen is diffu&s;ed in the atmo&s;phere, and in
part carried by the winds into the &s;urrounding ocean; in&s;tead of
the manures occa&s;ioned by the &s;low decompo&s;ition of it upon or
beneath the &s;oil, or by the depredation of in&s;ects; which might
&s;upply le&s;s decompo&s;ed nutriment to the ab&s;orbent roots of
plants.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="227">
This may be more ea&s;y to conceive, if we compare the little
vegetable nutriment, which could be derived from the &s;mall
quantity of a&s;hes left from a cart-load of burnt-&s;traw, with that
which would ari&s;e from the &s;ame quantity of &s;traw mixed with
&s;ome animal recrements, and made into a manure heap. A
&s;till greater diminution of u&s;eful manure would be made by burn|ing
&s;havings or ra&s;pings of horn, or woollen rags, or hair, or
fle&s;h; as a nutritive mucilage would be thus decompo&s;ed into its
elements, which might otherwi&s;e have been gradually di&s;&s;olved
beneath the &s;oil, and ab&s;orbed by the roots of vegetables nearly
in an unaltered &s;tate; as jellies and mucilage are known to be
drank up by the lacteals of animals; and, when drank in too
great abundance, to appear almo&s;t unchanged in their urine.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t hence appear, that the numerous fires of a great city,
if &s;upplied with wood in&s;tead of coals, as in Paris, mu&s;t very
much impoveri&s;h a great part of the country which &s;upplies it;
not only in the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing large tracts of land for the
growth of fire-wood, but al&s;o becau&s;e &s;o &s;mall a part of it re|turns
as manure. There is a provident adage of general bene|volence,
&startq;Burn nothing which any animal will eat; that is,
Burn nothing which may nouri&s;h animals by its dige&s;tion in
their &s;tomachs.&endq; May not the &s;ame benevolent idea be ex|tended
to the vegetable world, and &s;ay, &startq;Burn nothing which
may nouri&s;h vegetables by its &s;low decompo&s;ition beneath the
&s;oil, which con&s;titutes their &s;tomachs.&endq;</P>
<P>5. It may be a matter of u&s;e as well as of curio&s;ity to a&s;cer|tain
the &s;ituations and circum&s;tances mo&s;t favourable for pro|moting
the &s;pontaneous decompo&s;ition of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances;
which may con&s;i&s;t perhaps in the due quantity of air, water, and
heat, with a &s;ufficient proportion of animal &s;ub&s;tances, and
finally an admixture of lime toward the end of the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>1. In a cellar covered with an arch of bricks, and clo&s;ed with
a very &s;trong door, I once ob&s;erved, that a deal &s;helf two
inches in thickne&s;s was decayed, &s;o as to fall down with &s;ome
wine bottles on it, in about four years. This &s;udden decay I
believed to have been owing to the unchanging moi&s;ture of the
board, and at the &s;ame time to its expo&s;ure to unchanged air with|out
the power of much exhalation; by which a &s;low fermentation
<PB N="222" REF="228">
was induced, and a con&s;equent &s;low putrefaction, unchecked
by the extremes either of heat or cold.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on I &s;uppo&s;e the wooden &s;upporters of
bridges decay fir&s;t ju&s;t above the &s;urface of the water; and
pieces of timber buried but a few inches under ground, which
are there expo&s;ed to the influence both of water and air, go
quicker into fermentation, and con&s;equent putrefaction, than
tho&s;e pieces of timber, which are many feet buried beneath the
&s;oil, or immer&s;ed deep in water; which in that &s;ituation con|tinue
unchanged for ages. The &s;ame &s;eems to occur in the
vinous fermentation, which is in&s;tantly checked, if not totally
&s;topped, by bunging the barrel, or corking the bottle, which
contains it, and thus precluding the acce&s;s of atmo&s;pheric
air.</P>
<P>2. From hence it may be concluded, fir&s;t, that the vegetable
and animal &s;ub&s;tances, which we wi&s;h &s;oon to become decom|po&s;ed
by the fermentative and putrefactive proce&s;&s;es, &s;hould be
expo&s;ed to an uniform moi&s;ture, though not covered deep with
water; as is generally practi&s;ed in the fir&s;t part of the prepara|tion
of hemp or flax, which is de&s;igned to di&s;&s;olve the mucilage,
and the cellular membrane of tho&s;e vegetables, without injuring
the ligneous fibres. And that they &s;hould be &s;o far accumulat|ed
as not too much to exhale; yet not to lie in &s;uch large heaps,
as entirely to preclude the acce&s;s of air from the interior parts
of them.</P>
<P>The manures of great farms &s;hould therefore be occa&s;ionally
removed from the fold-yards, or large re&s;ervoirs of it, and laid
in &s;mall heaps not only to increa&s;e its &s;urface expo&s;ed to the
external atmo&s;phere, for the purpo&s;e of exciting greater fermen|tation,
which is a &s;low combu&s;tion; but al&s;o that air may be
impri&s;oned in the inter&s;tices of the&s;e manure-heaps, as men|tioned
in No. 8. 2. of this &s;ection. It &s;hould then be u&s;ed on
or in the &s;oil, as it afterwards lo&s;es much of its nutritive quali|ties
by evaporation, or &s;inking into the ground, or draining,
away.</P>
<P>3. A due degree of heat is nece&s;&s;ary for the commencement
of fermentation and putrefaction, as both vegetable and animal
materials, as fruit or fle&s;h, may be pre&s;erved for years if kept in
<PB N="223" REF="229">
an ice-hou&s;e below the freezing point of 32. And al&s;o, I am
told, if they could be kept in an uniform degree of heat above
the boiling point of 212. After the commencement of either
of the&s;e proce&s;&s;es a quantity of heat is evolved from the com|bination
of the oxygen and carbon, which contributes to for|ward
the proce&s;&s;es by promoting the union of the next particles
of oxygen and carbon; which may thence be compared to a
&s;low combu&s;tion, or to a gradual explo&s;ion of gunpowder.</P>
<P>This heat therefore &s;hould be managed with &s;ome addre&s;s, as
a great quantity of it would calcine or evaporate too much of
the materials, and leave the remainder a le&s;s profitable ma&s;s;
as happens, I am informed, to &s;ome parts of tho&s;e heaps of
manure, which are u&s;ed in the manufactory of white lead;
while on the contrary, when the heat is too &s;mall, as in &s;evere
fro&s;t, the&s;e proce&s;&s;es of decompo&s;ition will not commence, or may
be &s;topped in their progre&s;s. In the former ca&s;e, where the heat
is too great, it may be checked by covering the whole manure-heap
with &s;oil and turf, and thus preventing the acce&s;s of air.
And when the heat is too &s;mall, as in old hot beds, it may be
renewed or promoted by turning the heap over with the &s;pade,
and thus confining a new quantity of air in its inter&s;tices. On
the&s;e accounts it appears, that in the vernal and autumnal monsht
the&s;e proce&s;&s;es mu&s;t &s;ucceed better than in the winter or the &s;um|mer
ones.</P>
<P>4. Toward the end of the putrefactive proce&s;s the materials
&s;hould be repeatedly turned over with the &s;pade, not only for
the purpo&s;e of &s;imply expo&s;ing their interior parts to the atmo&s;|phere,
but al&s;o of including air in the inter&s;tices; a&s; the union
of carbon with oxygen, and probably of azote with hydrogen,
&s;eems thus to be occa&s;ioned; by which the three la&s;t of the&s;e
elements may change from a ga&s;&s;eous &s;tate into a fluid one, and
thus become absorbed by vegetable roots.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I conclude that in general the manure heap before
&s;tables, or in the fold-yard, &s;hould be placed on a gently ri&s;ing
eminence, with a ba&s;on beneath it, that the &s;uperfluou&s; water,
which would otherwi&s;e prevent the fermentation of the &s;traw,
may drain off and be there received; and that into this ba&s;on, as
often as a fluid appears in it, &s;ome earth, or weeds, or leaves, or
<PB N="224" REF="230">
&s;aw-du&s;t, or other vegetable or animal recrements &s;hould be
thrown; the fermentation and putrefaction of which will be thus
forwarded, and the carbonic draining from the manure-heap will
not be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>5. The admixture of lime with this carbonic &s;oil is found by
daily experience to produce the mo&s;t fertile compo&s;itions for the
growth of vegetables, and for the production of nitre. The
great u&s;e of nitrous acid in vegetation has long been acknow|ledged,
and that of hyper-oxygenated marine acid appears pro|bable
from recent experiments; and would &s;eem to be occa&s;ioned
by the more loo&s;e adhe&s;ion of the oxygen in tho&s;e acids to their
re&s;pective ba&s;es; which may therefore in its fluid &s;tate be more
readily ab&s;orbed by vegetable roots. One u&s;e therefore of the
admixture of lime in &s;uch a compo&s;t of &s;oil and manure is to
arre&s;t the nitrous acid, as it is formed, and by making a calca|reous
nitre, prevent its exhalation, or its ea&s;y elutriation from
the other materials.</P>
<P>6. A principal circum&s;tance for the quicker and more perfect
decompo&s;ition of vegetable recrements is a due quantity of ani|mal
matter, and their being properly mixed together; as ap|pears
from the early experiments of &s;ir John Pringle and Mac|bride,
and by daily experience. There is neverthele&s;s great
neglect in this re&s;pect in all tho&s;e farm-yards, where the &s;wine
hare their food in fixed &s;tone-troughs, from which the refu&s;e is
occa&s;ionally wa&s;hed or &s;wept. Whereas if wooden moveable
&s;wine-troughs were always placed on the &s;ummit of the heaps of
dry &s;traw, the quantity of their &s;will, con&s;i&s;ting of broth, whey,
and other vegetable and animal matter, which the&s;e animals
wa&s;te in their contention for it, would generate early putrefac|tive
proce&s;&s;es; be&s;ides their mixing the &s;ub&s;tances well together
with their feet, and adding to it their urine and ordure.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this inattention to the manure-heap in many hou&s;es
the wa&s;hings of boilers, and milk-pans, and di&s;hes, as well as the
&s;oap-&s;uds, which are all of them manures of the mo&s;t productive
kind, are thrown into the common &s;ewer, in&s;tead of being de|rived
or carried to the garden or the &s;traw-yard.</P>
<P>7. Another inattention to the production of manures concerns
the heaps of common weeds, and of dock-roots, and of cab|bage-&s;talks,
<PB N="225" REF="231">
and the roots of twitch-gra&s;s; which improvident
farmers and gardeners frequently throw into the high roads, or
con&s;ume with fire; and which if laid on heaps, and occa&s;ion|ally
turned over, and covered with &s;oil, will quickly die, and
pa&s;s into &s;peedy fermentation from the &s;ugar and mucilage,
which they contain; and if to the&s;e a portion of lime be added,
I am informed by one who made the experiment, that the whole
was decompo&s;ed in a &s;hort time, and manure of the be&s;t kind
was the product.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;hould be practi&s;ed with the leaves which fall in au|tumn
on gra&s;s land, e&s;pecially from tho&s;e orchards, or hedges,
or from goo&s;eberry-trees, which have been infe&s;ted with cater|pillars;
&s;ince I am told the eggs of a future race of the&s;e in&s;ects
are frequently depo&s;ited on the leaves, and hatched on or be|neath
the &s;oil in the en&s;uing &s;pring. The&s;e therefore &s;hould be
removed from the roots of &s;uch trees, and converted into ma|nure
by the proce&s;s above mentioned.</P>
<P>Along with the weeds and leaves above mentioned I &s;hould
&s;trongly recommend to the indu&s;trious agricultor to collect the
water-plants which grow in great abundance in lakes and rivers,
for the purpo&s;e of manure; which at pre&s;ent are employed to no
advantage. The&s;e might be moved twice a year, as it is proba|ble
that the&s;e vegetables in their younger &s;tate, as the typha, or
cat's-tail; the butomus, or flowering ru&s;h; nymphaea and ali&s;ma,
as well as many other aquatic plants, would give better manure,
or &s;ooner become &s;ufficiently decompo&s;ed, during their more &s;ac|charine
and mucilaginous &s;tate, than when they have acquired
more fibrous leaves, and more woody &s;tems.</P>
<P>By thus expo&s;ing the roots and tops of weeds to fermentation$
their &s;eeds would al&s;o be de&s;troyed as well as the vegetative
power of their roots; and on this account the hay-&s;eeds col|lected
from &s;tacks which have fermented too violently, &s;o as to
become black by this &s;low combu&s;tion, are frequently &s;o much
injured as not to vegetate, to the great di&s;appointment of the
&s;ower, a circum&s;tance which al&s;o &s;ometimes occurs in &s;tacks of
wheat, as mentioned in Sect. XVI. 7. 1.</P>
<P>8. La&s;tly, peat, &s;o well under&s;tood and &s;o &s;trongly recom|mended
by Lord Dundonald, is too much neglected in agricul|ture.
<PB N="226" REF="232">
The peat or turf, which con&s;titutes the &s;olid parts of
mora&s;&s;es, as it con&s;i&s;ts of vegetable fibres in different &s;tates of
decompo&s;ition, may be laid on clayey or &s;andy &s;oils with the
greate&s;t advantage; and ought to be con&s;idered as an ine&s;timable
trea&s;ure to the farms in its vicinity. Or it may previou&s;ly be
laid on heaps, and thus mixed with air and drained from water
for further decompo&s;ition, with or without the addition of lime.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>XII. APPLICATION OF MANURES.</HEAD>
<P>Two que&s;tions of importance here pre&s;ent them&s;elves. As
the &s;pontaneous or chemical changes of manure-heaps in farmyards
gradually progrede from the &s;accharine and mucilaginous
commencement through a great variety of other fermentations;
which can only be named from the principal material, which
each of there produces, as carbonic acid, alcohol, vinegar, vo|latile
alkali, hydrogen, nitrous acid, and finally carbonic earth.
At what era or &s;tage of this decompo&s;ition of vegetable and ani|mal
&s;ub&s;tances can they be mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly applied to the
purpo&s;es of agriculture? and &s;econdly, at what time of the year?</P>
<P>1. In re&s;pect is the era of the progre&s;s of the decompo&s;ition
in manure-heaps, in which they may be mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly ap|plied
in agriculture, the particular purpo&s;e of that application
mu&s;t be attended to. Where they are de&s;igned to be &s;pread on
the &s;urface of gra&s;s lands, as a top-dre&s;&s;ing, the accumulations of
vegetable and animal recrements &s;hould be permitted to go
through the various &s;pontaneous proce&s;&s;es of decompo&s;ition,
which begin with the &s;accharine and mucilaginous &s;tate, and end
with the production of carbonic earth, with many kinds of inter|mediate
fermentations, if they may be &s;o called, which accom|pany
or &s;ucceed each other, and which I believe to be more in
number than have had names applied to them.</P>
<P>But that le&s;s of the fertilizing materials, whether of &s;oluble
&s;olids, or of fluids, or of ga&s;&s;es, may be lo&s;t in the&s;e &s;eries of
fermentations; it is a very advantageous management to cover
them with &s;oil, when the fir&s;t fermentation is advanced, as is
known by the production of con&s;iderable heat; or when the
putrefactive one has commenced, which is known by the &s;mell
<PB N="227" REF="233">
of volatile alkali, or of hydrogen. By this method the too
great rapidity of the&s;e fermentations is checked, and the fluid
part of the manure is retained by the addition of the &s;oil below,
and the ga&s;&s;eous part by that above; and if to this be after|wards
added a proportion of lime, which by uniting with the
nitrous acid may retain it from exhalation or from alluviation,
every thing is pre&s;erved that art can accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>Where manure-heaps are to be ploughed into clayey &s;oils,
which are liable to become too &s;olid and impenetrable to the root-fibres
of &s;eeds, as of wheat; or where knobby or bulbous roots
are to be in&s;erted to produce other knobs or bulbs beneath the
&s;oil, as potatoes; it is probably more advantageous to bury
the manure in a le&s;s decompo&s;ed &s;tate, while &s;ome of the
&s;traw retains its form; as &s;uch parts by their flower decompo|&s;ition
will longer prevent the &s;uperincumbent &s;oil from becoming
too &s;olid; and though they will in this &s;ituation require &s;ome
time before they will be perfectly decompo&s;ed, and reduced to
the black carbonic earth; yet they will in the end totally decay,
and give the &s;ame quantity of nutriment to the roots, though it
may be more gradually applied.</P>
<P>2. In re&s;pect to the time of year tho&s;e manures, which are to
be ploughed or dug into the ground, &s;hould be u&s;ed immediately
before &s;owing the &s;eeds or &s;etting the roots, which they are
de&s;igned to nurture; becau&s;e the atmo&s;pheric air, which is bu|ried
along with the manure in the inter&s;tices of the earth, and
which for many weeks, or even months, renders the &s;oil loo&s;e,
and ea&s;ily impre&s;&s;ed by the foot on walking on it, gradually
evolves by its union with carbon a genial heat very friendly to
vegetation in this climate, as well as the immediate production of
much fluid carbonic acid, and probably of a fluid mixture of ni|trogen
with hydrogen, which are believed to &s;upply much nu|triment
to plants.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e manures which are de&s;igned to be &s;pread on the &s;ur|face
of gra&s;s-land, which is called the top-dre&s;&s;ing, are be&s;t ap|plied,
I &s;u&s;pect in the early &s;pring; and &s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed over
the &s;oil almo&s;t in a &s;tate of powder, or in lumps of very loo&s;e
cohe&s;ion; as at this time the vernal &s;howers wa&s;h them into the
&s;oil; and they are applied to the roots of the gra&s;s, before their
<PB N="228" REF="234">
e&s;&s;ential parts are dimini&s;hed by winter rains or by &s;ummer exha|lation.
There are &s;ome in Derby&s;hire, who &s;pread manure even
on the meadows, which are annually overflowed by the Trent or
Derwent, at the end of &s;ummer, or as &s;oon as the gra&s;s is
mowed and removed; which appears to be an improvident ma|nagement,
&s;ince the aftermath, or autumnal gra&s;s, is thus ren|dered
unpalatable to the cattle; and the winter rains, or the
vernal floods, which generally occur with the return of the
&s;outh-we&s;t winds, after the &s;ea&s;on of fro&s;t cea&s;es, mu&s;t wa&s;h
away a great part of it.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the mo&s;t economical manner of u&s;ing manures in
agriculture Mr. Parkin&s;on a&s;&s;erts, that one great advantage of
the drill hu&s;bandry con&s;i&s;ts in putting the manure into drills,
which he directs to be made at two feet di&s;tance from each other.
He &s;ows wheat, beans, peas, cabbages, on this manure, and
affirms, that four loads of manure on an acre in this kind of hu&s;|bandry
is equal to &s;ixteen loads in the u&s;ual way of &s;preading it
over the whole of the field. Experienced Farmer, Vol. I.
p. 32.</P>
<P>3. A third que&s;tion here pre&s;ents it&s;elf, if the recrements of
vegetable and animal bodies buried a few inches beneath the &s;oil
undergo the &s;ame decompo&s;ition, as when laid on heaps in farm-yards.
And though this is accompli&s;hed more &s;lowly, yet it is
attended with le&s;s lo&s;s of carbonic acid, and of volatile alkali,
and of hyrogen, and of the fluid matter of heat; all which are
emitted in great quantity during the rapid fermentations of large
heaps of manure, and are wa&s;ted in the atmo&s;phere, or on un|prolific
ground; would it not in general be more economical to
bury &s;uch vegetable and animal matters beneath the &s;oil without
a previous fermentation and putrefaction?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that in &s;ome ca&s;e&s; the
u&s;e of recent vegetables ploughed into the earth is found of ad|vantage,
as in &s;andy &s;oils buck-wheat, or vetches, are &s;own,
and the crop ploughed in, before it ripens its &s;eeds. In this
circum&s;tance the recent crop is buried in its &s;accharine and mu|cilaginous
&s;tate, which mu&s;t undergo indeed a &s;lower fermenta|tion,
without being mixed with animal &s;ub&s;tances, but no part
of the organic matter, nor of the fluid heat, is lo&s;t to the pur|po&s;es
of new organization.</P>

&s;traw remains, is recommended above; and may in the&s;e &s;itua|tions
perhaps be ploughed into the ground even in their mo&s;t
early &s;tate, when rejected from the &s;table or cowhou&s;e, before
the commencement of their &s;pontaneous di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>So al&s;o in gardens, which are already fertile, and do not
want the immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mature manure, it may be more
economical to bury the weeds, as the ground is dug, than to con|vey
them to a manure-heap, and replace them after a twelve-month's
decompo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But where a luxuriant crop is immediately wanted, a manure-heap
towards the end of the putrefactive proce&s;s by being re|cently
interred in the &s;oil, which is immediately to be &s;own or
planted, has this great advantage; that the carbonic acid is pre|&s;ently
formed by the mixture of atmo&s;pheric air with the car|bon
of the manure; which exi&s;ts therefore in its fluid, not its
ga&s;&s;eous &s;tate, and is thence more readily ab&s;orbed. Secondly,
ammoniac is produced, and nitre, and hydrogen probably is
mixed with nitrogen; and the&s;e al&s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, exi&s;t at fir&s;t in
their fluid, not in their ga&s;&s;eous &s;tate. And thirdly, from the&s;e
combinations a genial degree of heat is evolved, which &s;o much
a&s;&s;i&s;ts the vernal growth of vegetation.</P>
<P>And where manure is to be u&s;ed as a top-dre&s;&s;ing, it is nece&s;|&s;ary,
that it &s;hould be in a &s;tate of powder, or in &s;mall lumps of
loo&s;e cohe&s;ion, as mentioned above; that it may be ea&s;ily wa&s;hed
by rains to the roots of the gra&s;s, or that the young &s;tems of
gra&s;s may readily &s;hoot them&s;elves through it; whence mature
heaps of manure are for this purpo&s;e nece&s;&s;ary; and on this ac|count
any adhe&s;ive manure, as cow-dung it&s;elf, &s;hould be week|ly
gathered from gra&s;s-ground, where cattle are nouri&s;hed, and
laid on heaps with &s;oil, or &s;traw, or weeds, to ferment or putre|fy;
till it becomes le&s;s tenacious, and can be profitably replaced
in the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="236">
Finally, I &s;u&s;pect the mo&s;t economical method of
di&s;po&s;ing of the &s;traw and dung from the farm-yard would be, as &s;oon as a
dark coloured water drains from the heap, by which much lo&s;s
is &s;u&s;tained, to carry the refu&s;e of the stable and cow-hou&s;e, as
freque$tly as convenient, to the ground, where it is de&s;igned to
be employed; and there to mix it with earth in heaps of proper
&s;ize, and to cover them likewise with &s;oil; and by the&s;e means
I &s;uppo&s;e the whole proce&s;s of decompo&s;ition may be carried on
with very little lo&s;s; and by the addition of a greater or le&s;s
quantity of &s;oil that the era of complete or mo&s;t profitable de|compo&s;ition
of the compo&s;t may be managed, &s;o as to coincide
nearly with the time it may be wanted.</P>
<P>4. Fourthly, it may be a&s;ked, what kinds of manure contri|bute
mo&s;t to the luxuriant growth of vegetables? In an&s;wer to
this it may be &s;aid, that as plants are inferior animals, and are
furni&s;hed with ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els in their roots corre&s;pondent to the
lacteals in the &s;tomach; that the &s;ame organic matters, which by
their quick &s;olution in the &s;tomach &s;upply the nutritive chyle to
animals, will by their flow &s;olution in or near the &s;urface of the
earth &s;upply the nutritive &s;ap-juice to vegetables. Hence all
kinds of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, which will undergo a
dige&s;tive proce&s;s, or &s;pontaneous &s;olution, as the fle&s;h, fat, &s;kin,
and bones, of animals; with their &s;ecretions of bile, &s;aliva, mu|cus;
and their excretions of urine, and ordure; and al&s;o the
fruit, meal, oil, leaves, wood, of vegetables, when properly
decompo&s;ed on or beneath the &s;oil, &s;upply the mo&s;t nutritive
food to plants.</P>
<P>Secondly, the chyle of all animals is &s;imilar to the &s;ap-juice of
all vegetables in this circum&s;tance, that they both contain muci|lage
and &s;ugar, and &s;eem only to differ in this re&s;pect, that the
chyle of animals al&s;o contains oil, which being mixed with the
mucilage gives it its whitene&s;s like milk. Hence tho&s;e matters
mu&s;t &s;upply nutriment mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly to vegetables which
contain mucilage and &s;ugar, or produce them with the lea&s;t de|compo&s;ition,
as the jellies from the &s;havings of horns, from hair,
woollen rags, and the &s;accharine matter of &s;weet fruits, roots,
kernels, &s;eeds; and in the &s;ame manner the&s;e things with the
addition of oil are mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly nutritive to animals.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="237">
Thirdly, &s;uch materials as contain in &s;olution tho&s;e &s;imple
&s;ub&s;tances which con&s;titute a great part of vegetable bodies as
carbon, which is found in mo&s;t earths; and oxygen, hydrogen,
and nitrogen, which are found in water and in air; and from
hence we may conclude, that whatever material has con&s;tituted a
part of living organic bodies, may again con&s;titute a part of
them; and that with more expedition, if they can be u&s;ed with|out
being decompo&s;ed into their primary elements.</P>
<P>Mr. Bewley, the Norfolk philo&s;opher, &s;aid to a friend, who
was riding by his &s;ide, that when he wanted a whip, he habitu|ally
looked for a dead &s;tick in the hedge, unwilling to pluck off
a leafy branch, and de&s;troy &s;o many living buds. He might
have added, that to burn a hair or a &s;traw unnece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;hes
the &s;um of matter fit for quick nutrition by decompo&s;ing it nearly
into its elements, and &s;hould therefore give &s;ome compunctions
to a mind of univer&s;al &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem therefore, that long roots fixed into the earth,
and leaves innumerable waving in the air, were nece&s;&s;ary for
the decompo&s;ition and new combinations of water and air, and the
conver&s;ion of them into &s;accharine and mucilaginous matter;
which would have been not only cumbrous but totally incompa|tible
with the locomotions of animal bodies; for how could a
man or quadruped have carried on his head or back a fore&s;t of
leaves, or have trailed after him long branching lacteals termi|nating
on the &s;urface of the earth? Animals therefore &s;ub&s;i&s;t on
vegetables; that is, they take the matter so far prepared, and
po&s;&s;e&s;s organs to prepare it further for the purpo&s;es of greater
&s;en&s;ibility, and of higher animation.</P>

<P>I. 1. THE great quantity of water required for healthy vege|tation
is treated of in Sect. X. 3. 1. But as all extrems are
injurious, too much water becomes pernicious to all except
aquatic plants. Whence the nece&s;&s;ity of draining tho&s;e lands,
which too much abound with moi&s;ture; the art of which is
<PB N="233" REF="239">
better under&s;tood, &s;ince the knowledge of geology has been
&s;tudied, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure diffu&s;ed among&s;t the people.</P>
<P>Lands in re&s;pect to the method of draining them may be di|vided
into two &s;ituations; tho&s;e which lie &s;o high, that the
water can de&s;cend from them, if it be properly collected and
conducted; and tho&s;e which lie &s;o low as to command no fall,
&s;ome of which are even below the level of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>2. In regard to the former it generally happens, that the
waters from the &s;prings beneath the &s;oil have not a free pa&s;&s;age
to the rivers in their vicinity; the nature of &s;prings &s;hould there|fore
be previou&s;ly under&s;tood. Many modern philo&s;ophers have
endeavoured to &s;hew, that all the continents and i&s;lands of the
world, as well as the hills, which embo&s;s their &s;urfaces, have
been rai&s;ed out of the primeval ocean by &s;ubterraneous fires.
This appears from the quantity of &s;ea-&s;hells, which form innu|merable
mountains; and from the fi&s;&s;ures in the rocks, of
which they con&s;i&s;t; the quantity of volcanic productions all over
the world; and the numerous remains of craters of volcanoes in
mountainous countries.</P>
<P>Hence the &s;trata, which compo&s;e the &s;ides of mountains, lie
&s;lanting downwards; and one or two or more of the external
&s;trata not reaching to the &s;ummit, when the mountain was
rai&s;ed up, the &s;econd or third &s;tratum, or a more inferior one,
is there expo&s;ed to day. This may be well repre&s;ented by for|cibly
thru&s;ting a very blunt in&s;trument through &s;ome folds of
paper, a bur will be rai&s;ed with the lowermo&s;t leaf &s;tanding
highe&s;t in the center of it. Or if at the original elevation of an
exten&s;ive mountain the lowe&s;t &s;tratum &s;hould not at fir&s;t &s;tand
higher in the center of the &s;ummit, it would in time become &s;o
by &s;ome of the upper &s;trata of the mountain being gradually
wa&s;hed away by rains into the valleys or rivers. On this up|permo&s;t
&s;tratum which is colder, as it is more elevated, the
dews are conden&s;ed in large quantities; and &s;liding down pa&s;s
under the fir&s;t, or &s;econd, or third &s;tratum, which compo&s;e the
&s;ides of the hill; and either form a mora&s;s below, or a weeping
rock by oozing out in numerous places; or many of the&s;e le&s;s
currents meeting together bur&s;t out in a more copious rill.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="240">
The immediate cau&s;e of &s;prings con&s;i&s;ts therefore in the con|den&s;ation
of the atmo&s;pheric moi&s;ture, during the night princi|pally,
by the greater coldne&s;s of the &s;ummits of hills, which is
explained in detail in the Botanic Garden, Vol. I. additional
note 26. The water thus conden&s;ed on the &s;ummits of hills
de&s;cends between the &s;trata of the incumbent &s;oil, &s;ometimes for
many miles together; but generally from the neare&s;t eminences
into the adjoining vallies.</P>
<P>3. Thus there is a &s;tratum of marl, which I have ob&s;erved
on the &s;urface of the lands about Derby, which extends many
miles in mo&s;t directions. This &s;tratum of marl is of various
thickne&s;s from 10 to 150 feet, and beneath it lies a &s;tratum of
&s;and, which is al&s;o of various thickne&s;s from a few inches to
&s;ix or eight feet, and of various degrees of induration; and be|neath
this lies another &s;tratum of marl to an unknown depth.
On the top of Radborne-common, about five miles north-we&s;t
from Derby, the &s;andy &s;tratum is quite loo&s;e, and ri&s;es above the
&s;tratum of marl, which is deficient at the &s;ummit of the hill.
Three or four &s;trong &s;prings of water bur&s;t out on the &s;ides of
this hill, which thus originate from the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;|phere
conden&s;ed on the cold &s;ummit, and pa&s;&s;ing through the
&s;andy &s;tratum between the two &s;trata of marl.</P>
<P>In the road to Duffield, about two miles north of Derby, the
&s;and-&s;tratum is cemented into &s;tone, as well as in &s;ome &s;itua|tions
near Radborne-common above mentioned. This &s;tratum
of &s;and-&s;tone is &s;ome feet in thickne&s;s, and lies four or five
yards deep, beneath the upper &s;tratum of marl, dividing it from
the lower one. At Normanton, about two miles &s;outh from
Derby, the &s;and-&s;tratum con&s;i&s;ts of a loo&s;e &s;and, &s;o white and
pure, that I imagine it might be u&s;ed in the manufacture of
flint-gla&s;s, and lies about twelve feet deep, beneath the upper
&s;tratum of marl, dividing it from the under one. In the town
of Derby on boring with de&s;ign to &s;ink a well, after having
pa&s;&s;ed about thirteen yards through marl, &s;ome &s;and was brought
up by the auger, and water followed, as related in the Philo&s;-Tran&s;act.
Vol. LXXV.</P>
<P>The dews therefore, which are perpetually conden&s;ing on
the &s;ummits of the&s;e hills, de&s;cend beneath the upper
and under
<PB N="235" REF="241">
&s;trata of marl, through the thin &s;tratum of &s;and, which divides
them, and form St. Alkmund's well, and many other &s;prings
in the vicinity of Derby; and probably all tho&s;e which &s;upply
the wells within the town.</P>
<P>But there is a &s;ituation, where the manner of the production
of &s;prings is mo&s;t agreeably vi&s;ible; it is about a mile from the
city of Lichfield, near the cold bath erected by &s;ir John Floyer,
in a beautiful piece of ground, which was formerly Dr. Dar|win's
botanic garden.</P>
<P>In this place a grotto about &s;ix yards wide and ten long has
been excavated on the &s;ide of a hill con&s;i&s;ting of filiceous &s;and|&s;tone
with this peculiar circum&s;tance; that the upper &s;tratum
of the &s;and-rock, which is there about $ive feet thick, is divided
from the lower &s;tratum of it by a &s;heet of clay not more than
three or four inches in thickne&s;s; on the upper &s;urface of this
&s;heet of clay, between the lips of the&s;e rocks, a perpetual drib|bling
of water oozes quite round the grotto, like a &s;hower from
a weeping rock. Such &s;heets of water having been often ob|&s;erved
to &s;lide between the &s;trata of the earth almo&s;t horizon|tally,
like the horizontal joints of a &s;tone-wall, have, I &s;up|po&s;e,
given the name of wall-&s;prings to them, to di&s;tingui&s;h
them from pipe-&s;prings, or &s;uch as bur&s;t out in a &s;ingle rill.</P>
<P>Thus this thin &s;heet of clay prevents the water from &s;inking
into the lower &s;tratum of &s;and-&s;tone; and produces other copious
&s;prings, which are collected at about half a mile's di&s;tance, and
conveyed by leaden pipes to the cathedral clo&s;e of Lichfield,
which is thus &s;upplied with water of uncommon purity, which
contains no calcareous earth, owing to its pa&s;&s;ing through &s;ili|ceous
&s;and over a &s;tratum of clay, and which would be a trea|&s;ure
to the paper-mill or the bleach-yard.</P>
<P>4. One other circum&s;tance in the pre&s;ent conformation of the
earth is nece&s;&s;ary to be mentioned; which is, that at the time
when the mountains were rai&s;ed all over the world by deep
volcanoes, or by central fires, &s;ome parts of the &s;ummits of
many of them, and of their &s;teeper &s;ides, rolled down again into
the new formed vallies. And &s;econdly, that &s;ince that remote
time the recrements of vegetable and animal bodies have conti|nually
been wa&s;hed down from the eminences by &s;howers, and
<PB N="236" REF="242">
have contributed gradually to accumulate in the vallies, and to
form the plains, which exi&s;t on the &s;ides of rivers. This ap|pears
from the tin ores found in the vallies in Cornwall in loo&s;e
pieces &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the proximate mountains; and from
the black carbonic &s;oil, or mora&s;s-turf, found in mo&s;t vallies.</P>
<P>5. From the&s;e clear ideas of the &s;trata of the earth, and of
the &s;treams of water, which &s;lide between them, and form what
are termed wall-&s;prings, it is ea&s;y to conceive, that the be&s;t
method of preventing the vallies at the bottom of hills from
being too moi&s;t mu&s;t be by cutting a long horizontal ditch into
the &s;ide of the mountain to intercept the water, ju&s;t before the
level land of the valley commences; and thus to carry away
the water before it comes upon the plain beneath.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e at the foot of the hill where the plain, which
is too moi&s;t, commences, &s;ome auger-holes &s;hould be bored to
find the depth of the &s;prings, that is to find the thickne&s;s of the
upper &s;tratum of the &s;oil. If this be only four or &s;ix feet, an
horizontal ditch &s;hould be cut along the bottom of the mountain
to intercept the water; which mu&s;t then be carried away by one
or more other ditches opening into this, and conducting the
water &s;o collected into the neighbouring rivulet.</P>
<P>As the &s;trata, between which the water de&s;cends in forming
the&s;e &s;prings, have generally the &s;ame inclination as the &s;urface
of the hill, or nearly &s;o; it follows, that the holes &s;hould be
bored, and the ditch cut, not vertically downwards, as is the
common practice, but perpendicular to the &s;urface of the moun|tain;
as by that means the &s;econd &s;tratum will &s;ooner be arrived
at; as &s;hewn in Plate V. at the end of this Section.</P>
<P>6. But if on cutting a ditch five or &s;ix feet along the bottom
of the hill perpendicular to the ri&s;ing plain, which forms the
&s;ide of it, the upper &s;tratum be not cut through; and in con&s;e|quence
no water oozes into the bottom of the ditch; it is then
proper to bore other holes at the bottom of this ditch &s;ome yards
deeper, or till water ri&s;es up through them into the ditch, if it
can be &s;o di&s;covered. Where this &s;ucceeds, many holes &s;hould
be bored, and the water received into the ditches, and conduct|ed
into the adjacent river; for the water will then ri&s;e into the
bottom of this ditch &s;ix feet below the wet &s;urface of the valley,
<PB N="237" REF="243">
and thus flow away, rather than ri&s;e up from the lower wall-&s;prings,
or apertures of the &s;tratum, through the incumbent &s;oil
to the &s;urface of the valley, which is &s;o many feet higher.
This well under&s;tood is the great &s;ecret for draining tho&s;e
grounds, where the &s;prings can not be cut into &s;imply by a
ditch.</P>
<P>This method has been &s;ome years practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s by
Mr. Elkington, but was previou&s;ly u&s;ed and explained by Mr.
Ander&s;on, as he a&s;&s;erts in his introduction to Vol. III. of his
E&s;&s;ays on Agriculture, who &s;unk a hole into the earth at the
bottom of a ditch in the year 1764, and the water ro&s;e &s;ix feet
above the &s;urface of the ground, and has continued to flow with
le&s;s violence ever &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>It &s;hould here be noticed, that where the water ri&s;es with
great force through holes thus bored into a deep &s;tratum, it is
liable to bring up along with it much &s;and, &s;o as &s;ometimes to
ob&s;truct its pa&s;&s;age; which &s;and in this ca&s;e mu&s;t frequently be re|moved
for a few days by the reapplication of the auger. Of this
a remarkable in&s;tance is publi&s;hed in a late volume of the Phil.
Tran&s;. By Mr. Wulliamy, who &s;unk a well 236 feet deep and
four feet wide; and, on then boring a few feet lower, with a
five-inch borer, &s;o much &s;and aro&s;e with a violent &s;tream of
water, as to fill up the whole well; which was repeatedly
cleared away by buckets in its fluid &s;tate, and at la&s;t the
water ran over the &s;urface to the amount of forty-&s;ix gallons
in a minute.</P>
<P>The manner of making the&s;e ditches narrower, as they de&s;|cend,
by &s;pades of an adapted breadth; and of making the lowe&s;t
part narrower than any other part, &s;o that the &s;houlders or edges
of it may &s;upport &s;tones, or faggots, to cover the whole at a
&s;mall expence without ob&s;tructing the currents of water, are
obvious to the workmen. In many &s;ituations hollow bricks, or
ridge-tiles, or old pieces of pla&s;ter-floors, may be worth the
additional expence of providing them.</P>
<P>7. There may neverthele&s;s be found &s;ituations, where the
fir&s;t &s;tratum of earth may be too thick to be ea&s;ily penetrated;
or where the water, conden&s;ed from the atmo&s;phere on the &s;um|mits
of the hills, may &s;lide between the &s;econd and third, or
<PB N="238" REF="244">
between the third and fourth &s;trata, which form the &s;ides of
tho&s;e hills, owing to a deficiency of &s;o many of the &s;trata at the
&s;ummits of them; and hence that it may lie too deep to be ea|&s;ily
arre&s;ted by a ditch, or by boring; and yet by its being
dammed up by the materials, which form the level plain of the
valley, may ri&s;e up through tho&s;e materials to the &s;urface, and
form boggy or mora&s;&s;y ground.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;ituations the common un&s;kilful method of draining
may be u&s;efully employed; which con&s;i&s;ts in cutting many ditches
four or &s;ix feet deep acro&s;s the bog or mora&s;s; and covering
them, &s;o that the water may have no ob&s;truction in pa&s;&s;ing along
them; which may thus, as it ri&s;es from below, be in part col|lected
and conveyed away; though le&s;s advantageou&s;ly than
where the &s;prings can be intercepted.</P>
<P>Another method of draining moi&s;t meadows has been by
making or opening drains almo&s;t annually by a large plough
with two converging coulters, and other adapted parts, for the
purpo&s;e of cutting both the &s;ides of a ditch at the &s;ame time,
and turning out the intervening turf and &s;oil. These large
ploughs have been kept in &s;ome pari&s;hes, and drawn over moi&s;t
commons by twelve or twenty hor&s;es, to form parallel ditches.</P>
<P>Mr. Adam Scott has invented for the &s;ame purpo&s;e what he
terms a mole plough, which con&s;i&s;ts of a coulter fifteen inches
long, and two and a half wide, to cut the &s;ward; and behind
this an horizontal cone of ca&s;t iron twenty inches long, and two
and half diameter at the ba&s;e, to the middle of which is fixed
an upright bar two feet long, and three inches and a half broad,
with a &s;harp edge. As this ca&s;t iron cone is drawn along &s;ix
or eight inches beneath the turf in moi&s;t lands, either in the
&s;pring or autumn, in many parallel lines, the water for a con|&s;iderable
time is conveyed away, and no injury done to the &s;ur|face;
which thus &s;eems to be an u&s;eful machine, and may be
well managed, I am informed, by &s;ix or eight hor&s;es. In very
moi&s;t lands, or at very moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, if more hor&s;es be u&s;ed,
their feet will not &s;ink &s;o deep into the turf, as each hor&s;e will
draw le&s;s; or a contrivance of adding broader &s;hoes of wood
to the hor&s;es like the &s;now-&s;hoes of higher latitudes, might

an&s;wer this purpo&s;e. See Tran&s;act. of Society of Arts, Vol.
XV.</P>
<P>8. There are neverthele&s;s &s;ome &s;ituations, where the water is
conveyed beneath the fir&s;t &s;tratum on a thin bed of clay over a
porous &s;and-&s;tone beneath it; as in the grotto at Lichfield above
de&s;cribed. In the&s;e &s;ituations by boring many auger-holes, or
by &s;inking wells, through the &s;tratum of clay the water will
penetrate the &s;and-&s;tone beneath it; and either pa&s;s away by the
poro&s;ity of this kind of &s;tone, or by the cracks or joints which
are always found in it; of which the horizontal joints were
formed at the time of the production or accumulation of the
&s;and beneath the &s;ea, which was then formed in horizontal
&s;trata; but the vertical cracks were made at the time of its ele|vation
by &s;ubterraneous fires. In the&s;e vertical fi&s;&s;ures the ores
of lead, ponderous earth, and calcareous &s;pars, are found in
the lime-&s;tone rocks of Derby&s;hire; and tho&s;e of tin, and
quartz, in the granite rocks of Cornwall.</P>
<P>9. The knowledge of this part of geology concerning the
formation of &s;prings may be employed for many u&s;eful purpo&s;es;
thus where the wall-&s;prings, or water-conducting &s;trata, lie &s;o
deep as not to be acce&s;&s;ible at a &s;mall expense; they generally ex|i&s;t
between the &s;econd and the third, or between third and fourth
&s;trata; which ri&s;e into day higher on the &s;ummits of the adja|cent
mountains than the fir&s;t &s;tratum; and hence, when they
are bored into, the water will ri&s;e higher, than when it is found
beneath the fir&s;t &s;tratum only; which generally becomes defi|cient
on lower parts of the adjacent eminences of the country.</P>
<P>Thus where water, de&s;cending in high columns between the
&s;trata of mountains, is dammed up below by the materials,
which fill up the vallies; if a hole be bored in the valley deep
through the incumbent &s;oil and &s;trata, it frequently ri&s;es much
above the &s;ource of the new aperture, and &s;ometimes above the
&s;urface of the ground. In &s;inking the king's well at Sheerne&s;s
the water ro&s;e 300 feet above its &s;ource in the well, as related
in Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. Vol. LXXIV. And at Hartford in Con|necticut
there is a well, which was dug &s;eventy feet before water
was found; and then on boring an auger hole through a rock
<PB N="240" REF="246">
the water ro&s;e &s;o fa&s;t, as to make it difficult to keep it dry by
pumps, till the hole could be blown larger by gun-powder;
which was no &s;ooner accompli&s;hed, than it filled, and run over,
and has been a brook for near a century. Travels through
America, Lond. 1789. Lane.</P>
<P>In the town of Richmond in Surry, and at In&s;lip near Pre&s;|ton,
in Lanca&s;hire, I am informed, that it is u&s;ual to bore for
water to a certain depth; and that when it is found in both
tho&s;e places, it ri&s;es &s;o high as to flow over the &s;urface. And
there is rea&s;on to conclude, that if &s;imilar experiments were
made in many other places, &s;uch artificial &s;prings might be pro|duced
at &s;mall expence, both for the common purpo&s;es of life,
and for the great improvement of lands by watering them.</P>
<P>10. Another deduction, which may be made from this know|ledge
of geology, is, that many &s;prings of water, which lie too
low for &s;erving a hou&s;e, or &s;treet, or town, or for watering
higher grounds for the purpo&s;es of agriculture or gardening,
may in many &s;ituations be dammed up many feet with little or
no lo&s;s. Thus when the new bridge was building at Dublin,
Mr. G. Semple found a &s;pring in the bed of the river, where
he meant to lay the foundation of a pier; which by fixing
iron pipes into it he rai&s;ed many feet; and in boring a hole near the
Derwent in Derby about fifteen yards deep, the water ro&s;e
above the &s;urface of the ground, and has continued to flow now
for above twelve years in rather an increa&s;ing quantity. From
having ob&s;erved a valley north-we&s;t of St. Alkmund's well near
Derby, at the head of which that &s;pring of water once probably
exi&s;ted, and by its current formed the valley, (which current
in after times found its way out in its pre&s;ent lower &s;ituation),
I &s;u&s;pect, that St. Alkmund's well might by building round it
be rai&s;ed high enough to &s;upply many &s;treets in Derby with
&s;pring water, which are now only &s;upplied with river water.</P>
<P>11. A third deduction from the knowledge of this geology
concerning the production of &s;prings teaches, that by enlarging
the bottom of a well, where the water oozes from between the
&s;urrounding &s;trata in too &s;canty a &s;upply, a proportionally greater
quantity of water may be procured. The hole near the river
Derwent in Derby above mentioned, is about an inch and a
<PB N="241" REF="247">
half in diameter and was bored about fifteen yards deep through
the uppermo&s;t &s;tratum of marl into the &s;and beneath it, and &s;up|plies
Dr. Darwin's hou&s;e with two or three hog&s;heads of water
a day. And Mr. Strutt near St. Peter's Bridge has &s;unk a well
for the u&s;e of his &s;team-engine about 200 yards from the former,
which pa&s;&s;es through the &s;ame upper &s;tratum of marl, and is
three feet in diameter at the bottom, and &s;upplies, when re|quired,
a hundred hog&s;heads in a day.</P>
<P>12. The knowledge of this part of geology leads to another
u&s;eful purpo&s;e, the di&s;covery of &s;prings; concerning which &s;ome
have pretended to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ecret or my&s;tical intelligence both in
England and in France. When the eminences of a country
were rai&s;ed out of the primeval ocean by &s;ubterraneous fires, &s;ome
of them were rai&s;ed nearly equal on all &s;ides, like the lime&s;tone
mountain at Breedon in Leice&s;ter&s;hire; in which the central
&s;tratum may be &s;een to &s;tand nearly erect or vertical, and tho&s;e
on all &s;ides at con&s;iderable inclination. Other mountains were
abruptly broken off on one &s;ide only from the adjoining earth,
like tho&s;e which form the high torr at Matlock; which ri&s;e with
one of their &s;ides perpendicular as a wall by the Derwent &s;ide;
&s;o that the &s;trata of the former of the&s;e mountains may be re|pre&s;ented,
as before mentioned, by the bur, which would be
made on &s;ome folds of paper, if a very hard blunt in&s;trument
was thru&s;t through them; and the latter by rai&s;ing up one edge
of fuch &s;olds of paper, &s;o as to incline the whole of it at &s;ome
angle with the horizon.</P>
<P>As the &s;prings con&s;i&s;t of the water, which &s;lides between
these inclined &s;trata; it is evident, that in &s;ome eminences of
ground they are only to be met with on one &s;ide of the mountain;
and in other eminences of ground on all &s;ides of it. In &s;earching
for &s;prings therefore attention &s;hould be given to the inclination
of the &s;trata of that part of the country, which may be often &s;een
in marl-pits, gravel-pits, or in hollow lanes. But they may in
general be found above any moi&s;t or mora&s;&s;y plain or valley;
the moi&s;ture of which &s;hews, that &s;prings exi&s;t in the &s;trata on that &s;ide of the mountain.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="248">
A &s;econd ob&s;ervation for the purpo&s;e of detecting &s;prings may
be made on mi&s;ty evenings; as tho&s;e parts of the ground,
where the mi&s;t commences, are moi&s;ter than tho&s;e in their vici|nity
on the &s;ame level; and in con&s;equence may generally, if
they are not hollow ba&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;prings nearer the &s;urface;
for the&s;e moi&s;ter parts of the ground, having evaporated more
during the day, are become colder on their &s;urfaces than the
drier ground in their vicinity; and in mi&s;ty evenings, which are
at the &s;ame time calm, the &s;tationary air over the&s;e moi&s;t parts
of the ground is al&s;o more loaded with the evaporated moi&s;ture;
and on both the&s;e accounts the&s;e moi&s;ter &s;ituations are liable to
&s;hew a conden&s;ation of aerial vapour &s;ooner than other places on
the &s;ame level.</P>
<P>As mountains are colder in proportion to their height, which
is explained in Botanic Garden, Vol. I. additional note 26, the
evening mi&s;t &s;ometimes commences &s;ooner on them than in the
valleys; but is &s;een earlier in the&s;e &s;ituations over the moi&s;ter
places, if they are on the &s;ame level with the drier ones, exactly
as on the plains or valleys; and may therefore indicate the ex|&s;tence
of &s;prings, unle&s;s the&s;e moi&s;ter places, con&s;i&s;t of hollow
ba&s;ons containing water, which if not attended to may in all &s;itu|ations
deceive the ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;ervation for detecting &s;prings may be made in
rimy mornings; for as moi&s;t earth is a better conductor of heat
than dry earth the rime will &s;ooner melt on tho&s;e parts of the
&s;oil, which are kept moi&s;t by &s;prings under it than on other
parts; as the common heat of the earth, which is 48 in this
country, will &s;ooner be conducted upwards in moi&s;t places to
di&s;&s;olve the rime on the &s;urface. On this account the rime is
frequently &s;een on fro&s;ty mornings, when the heat of the air is
not much above 32, to lie an hour longer on dry cakes of cow-dung,
or on bridges, or planks of wood, than on the common
moi&s;t-ground; as the latter much better conducts the common
heat of the earth to the incumbent rime, which is in contact
with it.</P>
<P>But as the heat of the common &s;prings in this country is 48,
where they exi&s;t, the rime is &s;ooner di&s;&s;olved, than on the &s;tag|nant
<PB N="243" REF="249">
moi&s;ture of bogs or mora&s;&s;es. And as the &s;prings about
Buxton and Matlock, and at Bath and Bri&s;tol, are &s;o much
warmer than common &s;prings; it is highly probable, that where
the&s;e waters approach the &s;urface of the &s;oil, they mu&s;t much
sooner di&s;&s;olve the rime on fro&s;ty mornings; which may probably
be ob&s;erved in &s;ituations much higher than their pre&s;ent
apparent &s;ources; as they &s;lide down between the interior &s;trata of tho&s;e
hills, beneath the &s;ummit of which they are conden&s;ed from the
&s;team of water boiling at great depths in the earth; which ri&s;es
up through tho&s;e perpendicular clefts of the rocks, which were
formed at their original elevation, as explained in Botanic Gar|den,
Vol. II. note on fucus; and in Pilkington's View of Der|by&s;hire,
V. I. p. 256.</P>
<P>In the winter months the ri&s;e of &s;prings may be detected in
moi&s;t ditches by the pre&s;ence of aquatic plants, as of water-cre&s;s,
water-par&s;nip, brook-lime; as in tho&s;e ditches, which become
dry in the &s;ummer, the&s;e plants do not exi&s;t; and when tho&s;e
ditches with &s;prings in them are nearly dry, it may be di&s;covered
which way the current has formerly de&s;cended by the direction
of the points of the leaves of the aquatic plants as certainly as
by a level; an ob&s;ervation which I learnt from Mr. Brindley,
the great canal-conductor of Stafford&s;hire.</P>
<P>Finally, the&s;e arts of detecting the &s;ituation of &s;prings may be
advantageous to the attentive agricultor both for the purpo&s;es of
draining tho&s;e lands, which too much abound with water, and
for the purpo&s;e of watering tho&s;e, which are too dry, and which
lie beneath the level of the &s;prings, or to which the water may
be rai&s;ed by wind-mills or water-engines to be explained here|after.</P>
<P>II. 1. In re&s;pect to draining tho&s;e plains or mora&s;&s;es where no
fall can be had, the water may in many &s;ituations be caught by
cutting a long horizontal ditch into the adjoining mountain per|pendicular
to the inclined plane, which con&s;titutes the &s;ide of
the mountain, above the level of the mora&s;s, &s;o as to intercept
all the wall &s;prings; and may then be conveyed away in wooden
troughs or hollow bricks above the &s;urface; and if &s;ome water
&s;till finds its way into the mora&s;s, this le&s;s quantity may be con|ducted
<PB N="244" REF="250">
to one extremity of the ground in open drains or covered
&s;oughs, and rai&s;ed by an horizontal windmill and centrifugal
pump, as de&s;cribed at the end of this Section; and thus the
mora&s;s may be converted into &s;oil of the mo&s;t productive kind.</P>
<P>2. There may be other &s;ituations, as in the Peak of Derby|&s;hire,
where pools of water, or mora&s;&s;es, are collected on the
hollow &s;ummits of hills; which have been the craters of volca|noes
in the primeval ages of the world, as Elden-hole near Ca&s;tle|ton,
which &s;eems to have been the &s;haft of &s;uch a volcano. In
many of the&s;e ba&s;ons on the &s;ummits of hills there &s;till exi&s;t
what are called &startq;Swallows,&endq; or cavities; where the water &s;inks
into the earth, as it collects, to pa&s;s to &s;ome di&s;tant valley,
as Elden-hole above mentioned, and as in the channels of the
rivers Hamp and Manifold, between A&s;hbourn and Leek. In
others, as at the &s;ummit of a &s;teep promontory called Axedge,
near Buxton, and about Broke-hou&s;e, are unfathomed mora&s;&s;es,
which are &s;aid in &s;ome places not to bear a &s;heep to pa&s;s over
them; and that on the more tenacious parts of them it is nece&s;|&s;ary
for the adventurer to &s;tep from ta&s;&s;ock to ta&s;&s;ock, or to
carry a long pole horizontally in his hand, like tho&s;e who &s;kaite
upon &s;u&s;pected ice to prevent his &s;inking over head, if he &s;hould
chance to &s;ink at all.</P>
<P>It is probable, that by &s;inking a well, or boring a hole, where
&s;uch mora&s;&s;es or lakes now exi&s;t, into the ob&s;tructed &s;haft of the
ancient volcano, the water might be let off from tho&s;e eminent
mora&s;&s;es at le&s;s expence, than by excavating a pa&s;&s;age for it &s;ome
miles in a country of marble.</P>
<P>3. It is po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;ituations in high countries of
marble, or granite, or quartz, where the difficulty and expence
of excavating the ground may be too great, as above; in which a
&s;yphon might be contrived for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing the water
from a mora&s;s or lake, and conveying it away. Such an in|&s;trument
might be con&s;tructed of bored Riga deals; but as air is
liable to collect in the &s;ummit of a &s;yphon from the water,
which pa&s;&s;es through it, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to fix at the &s;um|mit
an air-ve&s;&s;el with an air-pump at the top of it; which might
be moved by a very &s;mall horizontal windmill &s;ail, to be de&s;|cribed
<PB N="245" REF="251">
at the end of this Section, or occa&s;ionally by the hand of
a labourer for a few minutes perhaps once or twice a day.</P>
<P>4. The draining of tho&s;e large plains, which lie beneath the
level of the &s;ea, is a &s;ubject, which belongs to the public, rather
than to the individual farmer; and is practi&s;ed near Linn on
the river Cam by locks to keep out the tide, and by windmills
to lift or forward the otherwi&s;e &s;tagnate water in the fen-dikes.
The&s;e windmills have vertical &s;ails of the common kind, which
move a vertical water-wheel, by which the water is rai&s;ed a foot
or two; but it is probable even this might be done better by the
horizontal &s;ail and centrifugal pump to be de&s;cribed at the end
of this Section, as being a &s;impler machine, and requiring no
attention to turn it to the wind.</P>
<P>It might be a noble work, worthy the attention of a govern|ment,
that wi&s;hed to increa&s;e the quantity of nutriment, and con|&s;equent
population and happine&s;s of the country, to employ pro|per
engineers with a number of labourers to environ with ditches
every mora&s;&s;y di&s;trict of whatever extent, which lies beneath
the level of the tides, as the fens of Lincoln&s;hire and Cambridge|&s;hire.
The&s;e ditches &s;hould be cut at the feet of the adjacent
ri&s;ing grounds, or of eminences &s;urrounded with fens, like
i&s;lands in a lake, &s;o as to intercept the wall-&s;prings and land-floods,
and convey the water thus collected above the level of
the mora&s;s into the ocean.</P>
<P>But this, I fear, is an effort not to be expected in the pre&s;ent
times, when the enclo&s;ure of fore&s;ts and large commons is pre|vented
by the intere&s;t of individuals, or by the difficulty of pro|curing
expen&s;ive acts of parliament for every minute di&s;trict,
in&s;tead of including them in a general act, so meritoriou&s;ly con|tended
for by &s;ir John Sinclair, then Pre&s;ident of the Agricul|tural
Society.</P>
<P>5. Where finally the draining of mar&s;hy grounds can not be
effected at a re&s;pon&s;ible expence, &s;ome plants may perhaps be
cultivated with profit to the cultivator; as in &s;ome &s;ituations the
fe&s;tica fluitans, floating fe&s;cue, callitriche, &s;tar-gra&s;s; or in
others the orchis for the purpo&s;e of making &s;aloop by drying the
peeled roots in an oven. This might be better worth notice, if
the &s;eed could be ripened in this climate for its ea&s;ier propagation,
<PB N="246" REF="252">
which probably may be accompli&s;hed either by cutting away the
new root, as is affirmed in the Amoenitates Academicae; or by
planting them in a garden-pot &s;o as to confine the roots in re&s;pect
to &s;pace, which is &s;aid in the &s;ame work to ripen the &s;eeds of
convallaria, lily of the valley; and la&s;tly by cultivating a &s;ew on
a hot-bed or in a green-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In other &s;ituations the menyanthes, bog-bean, would flouri&s;h
abundantly, and might become a &s;ub&s;titute for hops in the brew|ery,
and be equally whole&s;ome and palatable. It is indeed
much to be lamented, that we have no grain &s;imilar to rice,
that will grow in watery grounds in this cold climate, nor any
e&s;culent roots or foliage except the water-cr$&s;s. There is rea&s;on
to believe neverthele&s;s, that the roots of nymphaea, water-lily, or
of butomus, flowering-ru&s;h, may be e&s;culent by &s;imple boiling;
or that a whole&s;ome &s;tarch might be obtained from them; or
la&s;tly, that they might be fermentable into ardent &s;pirit, like
the roots of potatoes, or into vinegar.</P>
<P>The nymphaea n$lumbo is much cultivated in China in their
&s;wampy grounds, and in their lakes. The &s;eed is like an acorn,
and of a ta&s;te more delicate than that of almonds. The roots
are &s;liced and &s;erved with ice in &s;ummer at their tables; and are
pre&s;erved in &s;alt and vinegar for the winter. Emba&s;&s;y to China
by &s;ir G. Staunton, Vol. III. p. 214, 8vo. ed. The nym|phaea
alba of our country produces a root of three or four inches
in diameter. See Sect. XVII. 2. 3; and though the &s;eed is very
&s;mall, and perhaps does not perfectly ripen, I have ob&s;erved it to
be agreeable to the palate both in its recent &s;tate, and when dry.</P>
<P>If the&s;e &s;hould not &s;ucceed, other quick-growing plants might
be cultivated for manures, as typha, cat's-tail, caltha, and others;
which &s;hould be mowed twice a year, while they are young,
and in con&s;equence abound with &s;accharine and mucilaginous
matter ready to pa&s;s into fermentation.</P>
<P>III. 1. The advantages re&s;ulting from occa&s;ionally covering
lands with water have long been experienced in warmer coun|tries,
as in Egypt, Italy, and many parts of China; and have
of late years been introduced into our own more northern cli|mates.
The great importance of much water to the progre&s;s of
vegetation has already been &s;poken of in Section X. 3. And in
<PB N="247" REF="253">
the warm climates above mentioned, it is particularly u&s;eful in
the cultivation of rice for the purpo&s;e perhaps of &s;imply moi&s;ten|ing
the ground.</P>
<P>But the advantages of flooding meadow-lands in this country
may be divided principally into three kinds, one of which con|&s;i&s;ts
in &s;imply moi&s;tening them, which &s;eems to be the principal
u&s;e of watering lands in warm countries, where the water is
derived to them almo&s;t every evening from re&s;ervoirs above them,
or from water-wheels worked by a&s;&s;es, and which is &s;ometimes
$$one in the gardens of this country by watering pans and human
labour.</P>
<P>The &s;econd and greater advantage of flooding lands in this
climate con&s;i&s;ts in deriving much water over them from rivers or
from &s;trong &s;prings, and by thus &s;upplying them with the muddy
&s;ediment brought down by rivers, after &s;udden rains, or with
the calcareous earth di&s;&s;olved in many &s;prings. All tho&s;e &s;prings,
which pa&s;s through marl, or chalk, or other lime&s;tone, are re|plete
with calcareous earth; which they hold in &s;olution, as
tho&s;e about Derby and about Matlock, which earth they depo&s;it
on &s;tanding on the &s;oil, or in &s;lowly trickling over it. See Sect.
X. 6. 2. And river water in rainy &s;ea&s;ons is loaded with dif|fu&s;ed
as well as with di&s;&s;olved materials from the neighbouring
country.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e therefore are of great &s;ervice in flooding meadow-lands,
and perhaps almo&s;t all other lands. But tho&s;e &s;prings,
which pa&s;s only through &s;iliceous &s;and&s;tone, as tho&s;e at Lichfield
in Stafford&s;hire, have no calcareous earth di&s;&s;olved in them, as
I have found by experiment; and the water of mo&s;t rivers, when
they are not &s;welled by rain, are al&s;o too pure for this purpo&s;e;
as they have depo&s;ited already in their cour&s;e the calcareous
earth, which might abound in the &s;prings, which feed them; as
I have ob&s;erved by experiments on the water of the Derwent at
Derby, which though it runs for many miles about Matlock
through a bed of lime&s;tone, yet when clear of mud from rains, it
contains no calcareous earth, as it pa&s;&s;es by Derby, though the
&s;prings in the vicinity are replete with it. Neither of the&s;e
&s;ources of water can therefore do much &s;ervice for this &s;econd
de&s;ign of depo&s;iting lime&s;tone or mud.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="254">
The third advantage of flooding lands in this climate is for
the purpo&s;e of defending them from the cold of the winter or
vernal months. For this advantage the water from &s;trong
&s;prings, which are always at 48 degrees of Farenheit in this
country, is preferable to river water, where it can be had in &s;uf|ficient
quantity; &s;ince the water of rivers is of the &s;ame degree
of cold as the atmo&s;phere, till the thermometer &s;inks to 32.
But both of them, when they form a &s;heet of thin ice, as they
cover a meadow, defend the roots of the gra&s;s from &s;everer
degrees of cold; which are thus pre&s;erved, and tho&s;e of &s;ome
gra&s;&s;es are believed even to vegetate beneath the ice, as the rein|deer
mo&s;s in Siberia vegetates beneath the &s;now in a degree of
heat about 40, which the medium between that of the under
&s;urface of the thawing &s;now, which is 32; and that of the com|mon
heat of the interior parts of the earth, which is 48; and
thus the crops of gra&s;s in this cold climate may be wonder|fully
forwarded; &s;o as almo&s;t to double the product of the year,
if well managed and carefully attended to.</P>
<P>The method of forming the channels to convey the water
con&s;i&s;ts in carrying the first or principal aqueduct along the
highe&s;t part of the meadow, and deriving others on the &s;ummits
of the lands: if the meadow has formerly been ploughed into
ridges, and furrows, the&s;e again are to be divaricated &s;o as to
pa&s;s into the furrows; all the&s;e branches of the &s;tream are again
to be collected from the furrows, and di&s;charged at the lowe&s;t
part of the &s;urface.</P>
<P>Something &s;imilar to this mu&s;t be managed on more level
grounds, &s;o as to conduct the water over the whole meadow,
and al&s;o to carry it off, that it may not &s;tagnate; but that a
moving &s;heet of water about an inch in depth may continually
flow over the whole for the purpo&s;e of depo&s;iting the materials
di&s;&s;olved or diffu&s;ed in it. The con&s;truction and width of the&s;e
channels, with many u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, are &s;hewn in a pamphlet
of Mr. T. Wright, on &startq;the Art of Floating Land in Glou|ce&s;ter&s;hire.'.
Scatcherd. London.</P>
<P>2. Mr. Wright in the treati&s;e above mentioned advi&s;es, that
the aftermath of gra&s;s land &s;hould be eaten off bare by the be|ginning
<PB N="249" REF="255">
of November, and that the channels for conducting the
water to and from the meadows &s;hould be then clean&s;ed and re|paired;
and that the water &s;hould be &s;uffered to flow over the
meadow for three weeks; and that then the land ought to be ex|po&s;ed
to the air for a few days; &s;ince &s;ome of the gra&s;&s;es, and
tho&s;e of the mo&s;t nutritive kinds, he believes will not much
longer exi&s;t under water. By this early preparation, he adds,
that advantage is taken of the autumnal floods, which bring
along with them a greater quantity of putre&s;cent matter than
tho&s;e of winter.</P>
<P>In the months of December and January Mr. Wright adds,
that the chief care of the floater con&s;i&s;ts in keeping the land
&s;heltered by the water from the &s;everity of fro&s;ty nights; but
advi&s;es through the whole of the&s;e months every ten or fourteen
days to expo&s;e the land to the air by laying it as dry as po&s;&s;ible
for a few days; and always to di&s;continue the flooding, when
the land is covered with a &s;heet of ice.</P>
<P>In the month of February greater attention is required; if
the water be &s;uffered to flow over the meadow for the &s;pace of
many days without intermi&s;&s;ion, a white &s;cum is generated, and
the gra&s;s is much injured. And he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves that, if you
now take off the water and expo&s;e the land in its wet &s;tate to a
&s;evere fro&s;ty night, a great part of the gra&s;s will be cut off.</P>
<P>Mr. Wright adds, that in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire two methods of
avoiding the&s;e injuries are practiced: one is to take off the water
by day to prevent the production of the &s;cum, and to turn it
over again at night to guard again&s;t the fro&s;t. The other is to
take off the water early in the morning; and, if the day be dry,
to &s;uffer it to remain off a few days and nights; for if the land
experiences only one drying day, the fro&s;t at night will do little
injury. But the former of the&s;e practices, where it can be ea&s;ily
done, he thinks preferable to the latter.</P>
<P>In the beginning of March the gra&s;s on well-flooded meadows
will generally be &s;o forward, as to afford abundant pa&s;turage, and
the water &s;hould be taken off for about a week, that the land
may become dry and firm; and the cattle &s;hould for the fir&s;t
week be allowed a little hay in the evening if the weather be
cold and rainy.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="256">
In the month of April the gra&s;s may be eaten off quite &s;hort
and clo&s;e, but not later; &s;ince if you tre&s;pa&s;s but one week in
the month of May, the crop of hay, which is to &s;ucceed, will
be much impaired; and the gra&s;s will become &s;oft and woolly,
and the hay have the appearance of lattermath hay, and be les&s;
valuable.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the month of May the water is again
thrown over the meadows for a few days; which &s;imply by
moi&s;tening the land will in mo&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, Mr. Wright ob&s;erves,
en&s;ure a crop of hay of one ton and a half on an acre in the
cour&s;e of &s;ix or &s;even weeks.</P>
<P>The water is &s;ometimes again u&s;ed, when the hay is carried
off, but may render the lattermath, he thinks, unwhole&s;ome to
&s;heep. But this is particularly &s;erviceable, when the water is
rendered turbid by &s;udden rains. Some have taken off two
hay-crops in one year, but this Mr. Wright thinks is imprudent
in this climate; which however I &s;uppo&s;e might be accompli&s;h|ed,
where the fir&s;t growth is not eaten in April, and where
much turbid river water or calcareous &s;pring water can be u&s;ed
between them.</P>
<P>Mr. Wright further ob&s;erves, that the hay on the&s;e flooded
meadows is little inferior to upland hay, if it be cut at its proper
age; but that &s;ome avaricious farmers have permitted it to re|main
uncut till it produces three tons on an acre, and that then
it will become long and coar&s;e, and little better than &s;traw.
But that when it is cut in June, and has been flooded well with
muddy water in the winter, that it becomes little inferior to the
be&s;t upland hay.</P>
<P>The hay, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, which is cut before the gra&s;s is
in full flower, while the &s;accharine juice &s;till remains in part
at the joints of the flower-&s;tems, mu&s;t contain the mo&s;t nutri|tious
matter; which is afterwards ab&s;orbed as the flower ex|pands,
and as the &s;eed ripens, and forms the meal or &s;tarch of
the &s;eed-lobe, and is &s;hed upon the ground, or con&s;umed by
birds, and the gra&s;s-&s;tems and their leaves become &s;imply like
the &s;traw of ripened corn.</P>
<P>This will appear of more importance to any one, who at|tends
to the difference of the pods or hu&s;ks of peas, or of kidney-beans,
<PB N="251" REF="257">
during the early &s;tate of the enclo&s;ed &s;eeds, and again
after the &s;eeds become ripe. The pode or cap&s;ule is at fir&s;t
&s;weet and mucilaginous, &s;o as to &s;upply an agreeable and nutri|tive
food, the latter of which, and &s;ometimes the former, are
eaten at our tables; afterwards as the &s;eeds, which are attached
alternately to each &s;ide of the cap&s;ule, drink up by their vege|table
life after impregnation the &s;accharine and mucilaginous
matters there purpo&s;ely depo&s;ited for them; the cap&s;ule itself
becomes a mere fibrous membrane not better than the &s;traw of
ripe grains above mentioned.</P>
<P>It may be here repeated, that one great u&s;e in this country
of flooding gra&s;s-grounds in winter, and in early &s;pring, &s;o as
to let a thin &s;heet of water perpetually flow &s;lowly over them,
is, that it will in fro&s;ty nights, when the cold is not much below
the freezing point, produce a thin &s;heet of ice, and thus prevent
the cold from affecting the roots of the gra&s;s beneath it; which
may thus be two or three weeks forwarder than on other lands;
for ice is &s;o bad a conductor of heat, that water is not readily
frozen beneath it; and e&s;pecially if it &s;tands hollow, &s;o as to en|clo&s;e
a &s;tratum of air between it&s;elf and the water beneath.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to have been attended to by the philo&s;ophers in
the French army, when they pa&s;&s;ed over ice to &s;ubdue Hol|land;
fearing lea&s;t the ice &s;hould be too weak for the pa&s;&s;age
of their troops and artillery, they bored many holes through it
every night; and then by pre&s;&s;ure on its &s;urface the water
was made to ri&s;e through the&s;e holes, &s;o as to &s;tand an inch
above the &s;urface; which being thus expo&s;ed to the cold air of
the night, became frozen before morning; and thus in a few
nights thickened and &s;trengthened the ice ten times more
than would have been done naturally by the &s;lower freezing
beneath it.</P>
<P>3. To recapitulate the advantages of flooding, fir&s;t, not only
the common meadow grounds are enriched, but mora&s;&s;y ones
are con&s;olidated, by the mud brought over them from river
water; or the calcareous &s;ediment, and azotic or nitrogen air,
from mo&s;t &s;pring waters, during tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when gra&s;s does
not naturally make much progre&s;s in its growth. 2. They are de|fended
from fro&s;t by the flowing water, or by the ice, when
<PB N="252" REF="258">
it is frozen; and thus a much forwarder crop of gra&s;s is pro|duced,
as may frequently be &s;een over pieces of ground natu|rally
moi&s;t; which look green in the &s;pring, &s;ome weeks be|fore
that on drier land in their vicinity. 3. The ground is
rendered more ea&s;ily penetrable by the roots of gra&s;s, both by
its being kept &s;ofter, and al&s;o from its being &s;eldomer frozen
below the &s;urface in the vernal months. 4. This early crop
may be eaten off by cattle or &s;heep, and a new flooding for a
&s;hort time will forward the growth of it &s;o as to produce a good
crop of hay. 5. After the hay is removed another flooding
for a &s;hort time en&s;ures a luxuriant growth of autumnal gra&s;s,
or aftermath.</P>
<P>The difficulty of getting moi&s;t lands free from ru&s;hes is &s;aid
to be readily overcome by flooding them, and that e&s;peci|ally
after previou&s;ly moving them, as their &s;pongy pith will then
ab&s;orb so much water, as to cau&s;e them to putrify by its &s;tagna|tion;
or if this be done in autumn or &s;pring, and a fro&s;t &s;uper|venes,
the water in their pith by expanding, as it becomes ice,
bur&s;ts and de&s;troys their organic &s;tructure.</P>
<P>The following conclu&s;ion is copied from Parkin&s;on's Expe|rienced
Farmer. &startq;Upon the whole, artificial watering of
meadows is a mo&s;t profitable improvement; it robs no dunghill,
but rai&s;es one for the benefit of other lands; for if a farmer can
water ten acres of land, cut the gra&s;s and u&s;e it either in &s;tall
or fold-feeding, he might keep perhaps forty bea&s;ts; and by
working the manure made by them into a compo&s;t, and applying
that compo&s;t to other lands, he might either have a great deal
more hay for the winter, or &s;eed more cattle in the &s;ummer.&endq;
Vol. II. p. 68.</P>
<P>4. Two or three ob&s;ervations of importance &s;hould be here
in&s;erted. 1. That in flooding lands for a con&s;iderable time,
the water &s;hould only trickle over them from the canal, which
leads it along the more elevated parts, and not &s;tand on it like
a fi&s;h-pond; as in the latter ca&s;e the gra&s;s roots will peri&s;h in a
few weeks in the early &s;pring, to the great injury of the farmer,
an example of which on &s;everal acres I once witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as any materials thus begin to putrefy beneath the
water, a &s;cum of white froth ari&s;es owing to the air &s;et at liberty
<PB N="353" REF="259">
by putrefaction; which is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to injure the gra&s;s,
whereas it is a con&s;equence rather than a cau&s;e of injury, and
&s;hews that the water has &s;tagnated too long; and &s;hould either
be immediately drawn off, or &s;upplied by a running &s;tream:
but the former &s;hould probably be preferred: if the &s;tems of
gra&s;s are &s;o tall as to ri&s;e above the running water, it is proba|ble,
that their death and putrefaction do not &s;o &s;oon occur.</P>
<P>Secondly. It is ob&s;erved by gardeners, that in dry &s;ea&s;ons,
if you begin to water any kinds of plants, you mu&s;t continue
to repeat it; otherwi&s;e that they are &s;ooner injured by dry
weather, than tho&s;e which have not been watered. This fact
al&s;o I think I have ob&s;erved, and it may depend on the cir|cum&s;tance
of the roots of annual vegetables &s;hooting them&s;elves
lower down in dry &s;ea&s;ons in &s;earch of moi&s;ture; but if this be
given them in the commencement of their growth, they then
&s;hoot their roots more horizontally, and are afterwards in con|&s;equence
&s;ooner de&s;troyed by the &s;ub&s;equent dry weather.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Much cold water given &s;uddenly to plants, which
were nearly peri&s;hing with heat and dryne&s;s, will I believe &s;ome|times
injure or de&s;troy them, as I &s;aw occur this year, 1798,
in June to &s;ome rows of garden beans; which after being flood|ed
for one night withered, and in part died, on the following
day, which was probably cau&s;ed, not by the exce&s;s of water, as
plants of this genus would &s;eem to bear much moi&s;ture from an
experiment of Lord Kaimes, who &s;ays in the Gentleman
Farmer, that he planted a pea on &s;ome cotton-wool &s;pread on
water in a phial, and that it &s;prung up, and &s;hot roots through
the cotton-wool into the water, and produced large pods full
of ripe &s;eeds. The death of the&s;e beans was more probably
occa&s;ioned by the torpor of the &s;y&s;tem induced by cold, as oc|curs
to tho&s;e who have injudiciou&s;ly drank much cold water,
or plunged into a cold bath, when they have been previou&s;ly
much weakened by the unnece&s;&s;ary activity of the &s;y&s;tem occa|&s;ioned
by continued heat, or great exerci&s;e. See Sect XIV. 1. 1.</P>
<P>Nor is there rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that to whatever extent this
mode of cultivation of gra&s;s could be carried in this country,
that any injurious effects in re&s;pect to the health of the inhabi|tants
<PB N="254" REF="260">
could be produced; as this mode of flooding is not by
&s;tagnant water, as in rice grounds; which D. A. J. Cavanilles,
who has lately publi&s;hed a work on the cultivation of rice in the
kingdom of Valencia, believes to be injurious to the health of
the inhabitants. Magaz. Encyclop. T. 3.</P>
<P>In the&s;e cold climates the vicinity of running &s;treams may
perhaps be rather falubrious than the contrary; as the air is
cooled in hot weather, and warmed in cold weather, by its
contact with their ever-changing &s;urfaces, till they become
frozen. I at this moment recollect many, who lived to an
healthy old age in the valley of the Trent near the very edge
of the water, who&s;e names I could repeat. But &s;tagnate wa|ters,
from which putrid exhalations ari&s;e, produce agues in
cold countries, as in the fens of Lincoln&s;hire; and putrid
fevers in hot ones; from which our armies &s;uffered &s;o much
at St. Lucia both in the pre&s;ent and the la&s;t war.</P>
<P>5. This practice of flooding is capable of being extended to
a wonderful degree in this country, not only by u&s;ing the natu|ral
falls of brooks and &s;prings, and by occa&s;ionally damming
them up to &s;upply higher &s;ituations; and by effectually &s;pread|ing
the land-floods from accidental &s;howers over the inferior
lands to a great extent. And la&s;tly, the water, which is now
dammed up to &s;upply the numerous mills, might be diffu&s;ed
in rills over a thou&s;and meadows, or part of it be rai&s;ed by
pumps to higher grounds; and thus fertilize and enrich the
country; while the grinding of corn, &s;pinning of cotton, rolling
iron bars, and other mechanic purpo&s;es, might be effected
by wind-mills, or &s;team-engines, in almo&s;t every part of the
i&s;land.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e likewi&s;e the new method of rai&s;ing water by
the vis inertiae or acquired momentum of moving &s;treams might
be well applied, which was formerly used by Mr. Whitehur&s;t
of Derby on a &s;mall &s;cale at Oulton in Che&s;hire, as de&s;cribed
with a plate of the machine, to which an air-ve&s;&s;el is ingeni|ou&s;ly
added, in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions for the year
1775, Vol. LXV. p. 277, and which is now adapted to va|riety
of ingenious machinery by M. Boulton, E&s;q. of Soho near
<PB N="255" REF="261">
Birmingham; and is well explained with two prints in the
Repertory of Arts and Manufactures, No. LI.</P>
<P>6. The following water machine, which is on the principle
of Hiero's fountain, is de&s;igned to rai&s;e part of the water of a
&s;pring, or &s;mall brook, where &s;ome feet of fall may be acquired,
to a greater height for the purpo&s;e of watering higher levels of
ground; and the horizontal windmill with centrifugal pump is
de&s;igned for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, where no fall can be acquired.
We &s;hall then perhaps have &s;atiated &s;ome of our readers with
this &s;ubject of watering lands, and may conclude with
the &s;hepherds in Virgil's Eclogue,

<P>As almo&s;t all &s;oils not only contain carbon, and other inflam|mable
materials, which are capable of uniting with oxygen, and
thus producing the carbonic and other acids; but al&s;o contain
water, which by its decompo&s;ition, when in contact with con|fined
air, produces ammonia or volatile alkali by the union of
its hydrogen with azote; and nitre by the union of its abundant
oxygen with another part of the abundant azote or nitrogen of
the atmo&s;pheric air; there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the great
u&s;e of turning over the &s;oil with the plough or &s;pade depends
principally in the production of the&s;e effects by the confinement
of both the oxygen and the azote or nitrogen of the air in the
inter&s;tices of the &s;oil; and on this account we have entitled this
&s;ection the aeration of the &s;oil rather than the oxygenation of
it, as the latter belongs to the re&s;piration rather than to the nu|trition
of vegetables.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="263">
When atmo&s;pheric air is impri&s;oned in the cavities of the
&s;oil by turning over its &s;urface, which mu&s;t be in greater quantity,
when the &s;oil is reduced into the very &s;mall fragments, which
has been called pulverization; and when it is the lea&s;t pre&s;&s;ed
down by animals trampling on it, it more readily unites, I be|lieve,
with the materials above mentioned than in its free &s;tate;
which is probably effected by double or triple chemical affini|ties.</P>
<P>For this atmo&s;pheric air con&s;i&s;ts of oxgen, azote, and the
fluid matter of heat; now if the heat, which occa&s;ions the oxy|gen
and azote of the atmo&s;phere to exi&s;t uncombined in the form
of ga&s;&s;es, be attracted from them by any other material, as they
are confined in the cavities of the &s;oil, they may by their nearer
approach to each other combine into nitrous acid; or the oxy|gen
may in its fluid &s;tate, not in its aerial one, more readily
unite with carbone; and form a fluid, not an aerial, car|bonic
acid; which we believe to be of &s;o much con&s;equence in
the growth of plants, as &s;hewn in Sect. X. 4.</P>
<P>Add to this, that if any putrefactive proce&s;s be proceeding,
where atmo&s;pheric air is thus impri&s;oned in the cavities of the
&s;oil, and by the lo&s;s of its heat is converted from a gas to a fluid;
that the azote may unite with the hydrogen of the decompo&s;ing
water, or contribute to decompo&s;e it; and thus to form volatile
alkali, which like the nitrous acid, may either during the pro|cess
of its formation, or after it is formed, be of effectual &s;er|vice
to vegetation, at the &s;ame time the oxygen given out from
the decompo&s;ing water may contribute like that of the atmo&s;|phere
to produce carbonic, nitrous, or pho&s;phoric acids; and
thus to render carbon, pho&s;phorus, and the ba&s;is of nitre, capa|ble
of being ab&s;orbed by vegetable lacteals.</P>
<P>Where atmo&s;pheric air is confined along with water, I well
remember from experiments I made along ago, by inverting a
bottle filled with air in a jar of water, that the bulk of the air
was in &s;ome days &s;o much dimini&s;hed as to occupy only half the
bottle, which probably occurs from the decompo&s;ition of both
the water and air; and the production of ammonia and nitrous
acid, both which are believed to be &s;o &s;erviceable to vegetation,
as mentioned in Sect. X. 2. 9.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="264">
That the heat of the atmo&s;pheric air is given out, when
oxygen unites with carbon, is &s;hewn by the heat of hot|beds;
and of fermenting &s;accharine and mucilaginous fluids, as
in the production of ardent &s;pirit; and may be beautifully &s;een
in the combination of oxygen with carbon in the burning of
one of tho&s;e common letter-wafers, which con&s;i&s;t of the muci|lage
of flour, and red lead or minium; not one of tho&s;e, which
are called Iri&s;h wafers, and which are coloured with vermilion.
If one of the&s;e minium wafers be made to blaze in the flame of
a candle, the oxygen contained in the minium unites with the
carbon of the flour, and gives out a very luminous &s;park, and
con&s;equent great heat, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant a &s;mall globule
of melted lead drops down, and may be agreeably &s;een, if re|ceived
on a &s;heet of white paper held under it. It is al&s;o pro|bable,
that heat is emitted during the production of nitrous and
of phosphoric acids.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations it appears, that &s;eeds &s;hould be &s;own,
and roots planted, &s;oon after the &s;oil is turned over; while the
production of the carbonic, nitrous, and pho&s;phoric acids, and
of volatile alkali, and perhaps many other proce&s;&s;es, are pro|ceeding,
rather than after they are completed; and al&s;o while
the fluid element of heat is pa&s;&s;ing from its combined &s;tate, and
permeating the &s;oil, which in this cold climate in the vernal
months mu&s;t be highly conducive to vegetation.</P>
<P>2. By thus turning over the &s;oil with the plough or &s;pade
the penetrability of it by the roots of plants is al&s;o much facili|tated;
and for this purpo&s;e, as well as for the admixture of
atmo&s;pheric air, it can &s;carcely be reduced into too fine mole|cules,
or a kind of wet powder; for the moi&s;ture of &s;oil is as
nece&s;&s;ary for its being permeated by the young roots of plants,
as its &s;mall cohe&s;ion, as mentioned in Sect. X. 3. 6.</P>
<P>Secondly, a more intimate mixture of the various ingredients
which mo&s;t &s;oils po&s;&s;e&s;s, as carbon, calcareous, argillaceous,
&s;iliceous, and magne&s;ian earths, with various metallic oxydes,
as tho&s;e of iron, and &s;ometimes of mangane&s;e and calamy, all
which by frequent turning over the &s;oil with the plough or &s;pade,
become mixed &s;o as to act on each other or on the roots of vege|tables
in every minute part of the &s;oil.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="265">
And thirdly, the vernal rains are retained by their &s;inking
more readily into the pores and cells of land recently turned
over, and which &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an uneven &s;urface. Be&s;ides a
greater &s;urface of it being continually expo&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ing
air, and to the heavier impurities, which it perpetually contains,
as carbonic acid, &s;oot, odours of many kinds.</P>
<P>3. A recapitulation of the&s;e circum&s;tances leads us to the
knowledge of the use of fallowing lands, by repeatedly turning
them over much carbonic acid is produced in its fluid &s;tate;
and perhaps &s;ome of the nitrous and pho&s;phoric acids; the&s;e may
remain united with the vegetable recrements, or with volatile
alkali, or with calcareous earth. 2. The parts of the &s;oil may
become better mixed together, and thus either chemically affect
each other to their mutual melioration; or they may more uni|formly
&s;upply nutriment to the roots, which penetrate it.
3. The &s;oil may become broken into a moi&s;t powder, and may
thus be more ea&s;ily permeated, and &s;upply a greater &s;urface of
its cavities for the vegetable ab&s;orbents to apply them&s;elves to.
4. Unprofitable plants, or weeds, not being permitted to grow on
it, or their being perpetually ploughed under the &s;oil in their
early growth, much vegetable nutriment will be re&s;erved by not
being expended; or it will be increa&s;ed by the &s;accharine and
mucilaginous matter of the young plants, which are thus buried
in it.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be added, that &s;ome plants are &s;aid not to impo|veri&s;h
the ground, on which they have grown during their her|baceous
&s;tate, before the &s;eed-&s;tems have ari&s;en; as turnips,
when drawn up and carried away to feed cattle or &s;heep on other
grounds. This has been a&s;cribed by &s;ome authors to the &s;oil
having been &s;haded by their thick foliage, and thus not having
&s;uffered &s;o much by evaporation. Some have a&s;cribed this &s;up|po&s;ed
melioration of the &s;oil to its having been &s;creened or
over&s;hadowed by the thicker foliage of &s;uch crops; and that as
the putrefactive proce&s;s of vegetable recrements proceeds be&s;t
in damp and confined air, as wood decays &s;oone&s;t in cellars,
they &s;uppo&s;e the &s;oil may thus become improved. But Mr.
Tull &s;eems either to doubt the fact, or to attribute it to the
ground, where &s;uch plants are cultivated, being u&s;ually once
<PB N="260" REF="266">
or twice hoed; and thus in effect to have been followed by the
repeated aeration and pulverization of the &s;oil, and the de&s;truc|tion
of innumerable weeds.</P>
<P>If neverthele&s;s the fact be true, not only all the circum&s;tances
above mentioned may contribute to produce it, but al&s;o, as it
appears by the experiments of Prie&s;tley and Ingenhouz, that
though the per&s;pirable matter of vegetable leaves gives out oxy|gen
in the &s;un&s;hine, yet that it gives out carbonic acid in the
&s;hade; which even in its aerial or ga&s;&s;eous form is much heavier
than common air, and will therefore &s;ub&s;ide on the earth in the
&s;hade of this per&s;piring foliage, and contribute to enrich the
&s;oil by the hourly addition of carbon.</P>
<P>4. Neverthele&s;s where the &s;oil is already replete with ma|nures,
and these proce&s;&s;es productive of carbonic, nitrous, and
pho&s;phoric acids, and of volatile alkali, are going on in proper
abundance; &s;uch &s;oils mu&s;t be injured by being too frequently
turned over in &s;ummer fallowing; and thus by expo&s;ing too
great a &s;urface, and that too frequently, to the air, the &s;un|&s;hine,
and the rain; by which much of the fluid carbonic acid
will be converted into aerial carbonic acid, and e&s;cape, as well
as the pho&s;phorus and the ingredients in their &s;tate previous to
the production of nitrous acid, and of the volatile alkali. On
this account in the manufacture of nitre in France, Spain, and
Pru&s;&s;ia, it is directed to cover the compo&s;t of &s;oil and animal
recrements with a &s;hed to prevent too great exhalation and
ablution. Hence though a &s;ummer fallow may be of advantage
to a poor &s;oil, which has nothing to lo&s;e; it mu&s;t be di&s;advan|tageous
to a rich one, which has nothing to gain.</P>
<P>Lord Dundonald in his work on the Connection of Agricul|ture
and Chemi&s;try ingeniou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;es, that &s;oils become in|jured,
when much expo&s;ed to the air by fallowing, from the
carbon or other inflammable matters uniting with oxygen; and
that then being again combined with other materials, they be|come
in&s;oluble, producing lime&s;tone, calcareous nitre, and pho&s;|phat
of lime. But there is another injury to &s;oil by frequent
fallowing, which I &s;u&s;pect to be more exten&s;ive, from the e&s;|cape
of carbonic acid, or of nitrous acid, or of ammonia, into
<PB N="261" REF="267">
the atmo&s;phere in the form of gas, as above mentioned; or their
being wa&s;hed away by rains.</P>
<P>5. Hence the great advantages of Mr. Tull's ingenious di&s;|covery
of the drill hu&s;bandry are ea&s;ily under&s;tood. 1. By &s;ow|ing
the wheat in rows, &s;cattered by a drill-plough at regular
di&s;tances, and buried at a regular depth, the grain is neither
crowded, nor too thinly di&s;per&s;ed. 2. Nor are the roots bu|ried
either too deep in the &s;oil, or too &s;hallow. 3. By turn|ing
the &s;oil fir&s;t from the rows in the &s;pring for a week or two,
and then turning it up again&s;t the rows, the &s;oil becomes newly
aerated with all the good effects in con&s;equence. 4. It becomes
more penetrable by the &s;uperficial roots of the corn. 5. By
rai&s;ing it to the &s;econd joint of the corn-&s;tems, four or &s;ix new
roots with new &s;tems will &s;hoot out, generated by the caudex
of the &s;econd leaf of the corn-&s;tem; which is now within the
&s;oil, or in contact with it, as explained in Sect. IX. 3. 1. and
7. XVI. 2. 2.</P>
<P>Thus Mr. Tull's method of heaping &s;oil again&s;t wheat-plants
up to the &s;econd joint an&s;wers in &s;ome degree the &s;ame purpo&s;e,
as tran&s;planting the roots, and &s;etting them deeper in the &s;oil
with much le&s;s expence of labour. But for the more perfect
pulverization of the &s;oil, and the more complete aeration of it,
he in&s;i&s;ts much on the preference of hor&s;e-hoeing to hand-hoe|ing;
as the former pa&s;&s;es deeper into the &s;oil, and thus expo&s;es
a greater quantity of it to the air; and e&s;pecially of that part
of it, which before lay too much beneath the &s;urface to be pre|viou&s;ly
much affected by the incumbent atmo&s;phere. But the
great objection to the u&s;e of the hor&s;e-hoe is, that the alternate
rows of corn mu&s;t be placed at too great a di&s;tance, as will be
again &s;poken of in Sect. XVI. 2. 2.</P>
<P>To the many advantages of the drill hu&s;bandry above recited
Mr. Tull adds, that &startq;where the &s;pring-turnips are u&s;ed too
late in the year, there is not time to bring the land into tilth
for barley, and there is a lo&s;s of the barley crop in con&s;equence;
which he &s;ays is entirely remedied by the drilling method; for
by that the land may be almo&s;t as well tilled before the turnips
are eaten or taken off, as it can afterwards.&endq; Hu&s;bandry, Chap.
VIII. p. 89.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="268">
So many great advantages &s;eem to accrue from Mr. Tull's
method of drill-&s;owing and hor&s;e-hoeing, that a curious que&s;tion
offers it&s;elf, Why it has not been more generally adopted? Fir&s;t,
I &s;uppose, becau&s;e it is difficult to teach any thing new to adult
ignorance, &s;o that the ma&s;ter mu&s;t for &s;ome time attend the
proce&s;s with his own eye. Secondly, I believe the axle-tree
of Mr. Tull's &s;owing machine did not accurately emit the pro|per
quantity of &s;eed from the hopper, and was liable to brui&s;e
and de&s;troy &s;ome of it in its pa&s;&s;age. And thirdly, that the
improved drill machine of Mr. Cook's patent is too expen&s;ive
for the purcha&s;e of &s;mall farmers, who fear that it may not an|&s;wer
the expected advantages.</P>
<P>I have therefore given a print at the end of this work of a
machine con&s;tructed on a cheaper plan, which is &s;imply an im|provement
of that de&s;cribed in Mr. Tull's book, by enlarging
that part of the axle-tree which delivers the grain, into a cylin|der
of &s;ome inches diameter with excavations in the rim; which
rim ri&s;es above the &s;urface of the corn in the &s;eed-box, and lets
drop again into the &s;eed-box, whatever grains fill the holes above
the level of the rim, as that &s;ide of the cylinder a&s;cends.
Whence the quantity delivered is uniform, and no grains are in
the way to be brui&s;ed or injured, as explained at large along
with the print; and the whole machine is &s;imple, and of &s;mall
expence.</P>
<P>6. The mo&s;t effectual method of obtaining the great combin|ed
advantages of aeration and pulverization of the &s;oil is by tran&s;|planting
the roots of wheat, and parting them, as already &s;poken
of in Sect. IX. 3. 7. By taking up the roots and replanting
them in &s;oil lately turned over, and con&s;equently expo&s;ed to
the air, which is now con$ined in its inter&s;tices, all the advan|tages
already mentioned are effectually received, from the new
made fluid, carbonic, nitrous, and pho&s;phoric acids, and from
the ammonia, and other unnamed combinations. Secondly, all
the advantages ari&s;ing from the ea&s;y penetrability of the loo&s;e &s;oil
by the root-fibres, which are believed by Mr. Tull to put out
more radicles with ab&s;orbent mouths at every part, where they
are di&s;&s;evered, like a bru&s;h or pencil of hairs. Thirdly, by
parting the root-&s;cions from each other they acquire greater &s;pace
<PB N="263" REF="269">
of air for their re&s;piring leaves, and of &s;oil for their ab&s;orbent
roots. Whereas when too many &s;tems ari&s;e from one root, or
many &s;eeds are &s;own near together, a tu&s;&s;ock is produced in a
conical form ri&s;ing highe&s;t in the center; which &s;eems to be
occa&s;ioned by the conte&s;t of the &s;tems for air and light; their
roots al&s;o mu&s;t de&s;cend lower in their conte&s;t for moi&s;ture,
and for other advantages of the &s;oil; whence many of the&s;e crowded
&s;tems become barren, producing no ears, or ill-corned ones.</P>
<P>Another benefit from tran&s;planting corn is owing to the
quicker tendency to fructification, and con&s;equent &s;ooner ripen|ing
of the grain. Thus tran&s;planted garden beans and tran&s;|planted
brocoli flower &s;ooner, and I &s;uppose produce le&s;s &s;tems or
&s;traw, as mentioned in Sect. XVI. 1. 2. I am al&s;o well informed
by the Rev. Mr. Pole of Radborne, that the roots of tho&s;e tur|nips,
which were drawn out of the ground and tran&s;planted,
became con&s;iderably larger than tho&s;e, which were only hoed
in the common manner; which I &s;uppo&s;e to have been owing
to many of the extremities of the roots having been torn off in
drawing them out of the ground; and that thence the tendency
to &s;hoot up the new central &s;tem is delayed, and the re&s;ervoir
of nouri&s;hment accumulated in the tuberous root is thus increas|ed
in quantity, as &s;everal of the&s;e turnips weighed ten and eleven
pounds; and hence probably the tran&s;planting turnips by means
of a cylindrical &s;pade de&s;cribed in Vol. IV. of the Bath Society,
which tears the roots le&s;s, might not have been &s;o advantageous.
Something &s;imilar occurs in tran&s;planting fruit-trees. See Sect.
XV. 2. 4.</P>
<P>But the great advantage of tran&s;planting wheat above the
drill-husbandry con&s;i&s;ts in being able at the &s;ame time to divide
the root-&s;cions from each other; and thus not only to prevent
their crowding each other, but al&s;o wonderfully to increa&s;e the
product from a &s;ingle grain, with many other advantages men|tioned
by Mr. Bogle in the works of the Bath Society, Vol.
III. p. 494.</P>
<P>Another great advantage of tran&s;planting wheat con&s;i&s;ts in
this, that it may be &s;owed in a garden, one acre of which will
produce &s;ets for one hundred acres, if they be divided and plant|ed
at nine inches di&s;tance from each other; and as they are not
<PB N="264" REF="270">
to be tran&s;planted till the &s;pring, wheat may be thus cultivated
in moi&s;ter &s;ituations than would otherwi&s;e be friendly to its
growth.</P>
<P>And that a clean crop may be crtainly thus procured; becau&s;e
if the land be ploughed immediately before the plants are &s;et
out, the corn will &s;pring much quicker from the plants, than
the weeds from their &s;eeds; and the corn will thence bear down
the growth of the weeds.</P>
<P>For many other particulars the reader is referred to the in|genious
paper of Mr. Bogle above mentioned, who thinks the
tran&s;planting might be done by boys and girls at a &s;mall expence;
I &s;hall only add, that rape-&s;eed, which is generally &s;own in
Augu&s;t, and not reaped till the Augu&s;t following, might be
profitably tran&s;planted, as well as peas and beans. And la&s;tly;
that it is probable, that &s;ome means of making the holes to re|ceive
the plants might be much expedited by a broad wheel to
be drawn by a man or hor&s;e with prominent pegs on its peri|phery
two inches tall, and nine inches a&s;under.</P>
<P>7. Another means of aeration and of pulverization has been
u&s;ed in re&s;pect to wheat crops by many with advantage, and that
is by drawing a lighti&s;h harrow over a wheat-crop in the &s;pring,
which, where a crop is thin, is particularly recommended; and
may al&s;o be of &s;ervice where it is too thick.</P>
<P>The harrow by breaking the clods, and by turning up the &s;oil
again&s;t the &s;tems of many plants&punc; earths them deeper as in hoe|ing;
and thus by burying the &s;econd joint occa&s;ions it to tiller,
or &s;hoot out new root-&s;cions; at the &s;ame time the earth is
expo&s;ed to the air, and many weeds are rooted up and covered,
and &s;ome roots of the corn.</P>
<P>The drawing a &s;harp harrow over a field of wheat in the
&s;pring mu&s;t cut or tear many of the roots of tho&s;e &s;tems, which
it comes near, which according to Mr. Tull's theory would
&s;hoot out many new radicles, or pencils of fine roots, and thus
acquire more nouri&s;hment. But I &s;u&s;pect that tearing of many
of the root-fibres prevents the too luxuriant growth of the &s;tem
and leaves, and thence &s;ooner produces the fructification, as in
tran&s;planting. At the &s;ame time the earth being loo&s;ened be|comes
more penetrable to the remaining roots, as well as more
nutritive from its aeration.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="271">
Others have even ploughed a field at this &s;ea&s;on with good ef|fect,
as Mr. Bogle a&s;&s;erts; but both of them appear to be only
inferior kinds of drill hu&s;bandry; and the former may &s;o far be
of con&s;iderable utility.</P>
<P>8. Another method of aerating and pulverizing the &s;oil of a
wheat field in &s;pring is by rolling it, which may be done before
or after the u&s;e of the harrow, or without it. As the &s;urface of
a wheat field is generally left rough with clods or eminences, the
pre&s;&s;ure of a heavyi&s;h roller will not only pulverize the&s;e, and
thus expo&s;e their interior &s;urface to the air, and rai&s;e the &s;oil
round the wheat-&s;tems above the &s;econd joint, and thus induce
them to &s;hoot out new root-&s;cions, or tiller; but will al&s;o pre&s;s
down the wheat roots into the &s;oil, and thus al&s;o promote the
growth of new &s;tems as mentioned in Sect. XVI. 2. 5. if it be
performed, when the ground is neither too wet nor too dry for
&s;uch an operation.</P>

<P>I. 1. PHILOSOPHERS are not yet agreed, whether light and
heat be the &s;ame fluid under different modifications, or two dif|ferent
fluids, which exi&s;t frequently together. The latter opi|nion
&s;eems to be more probable from the circum&s;tances related
below, and al&s;o from the analogy of other aqueous, aerial, or
ethereal fluids which appear to con&s;i&s;t of two other fluids com|bined
or diffu&s;ed with each other. Thus water con&s;i&s;ts of oxy|gen
and hydrogen combined together. Atmo&s;pheric air of
oxygen and nitrogen diffu&s;ed together. Electricity probably
con&s;i&s;ts of two fluids, which may be termed vitreous and re&s;in|ous
electricity. Magneti&s;m al&s;o probably con&s;i&s;ts of two fluids,
which con&s;titute northern and &s;outhern polarity. The power
of attraction &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of gravitation and of chemical
affinity. And la&s;tly, the element of fire con&s;i&s;ts I &s;uppo&s;e of
light and heat.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;imilarity of light and heat is evinced by this &s;imple
circum&s;tance; that as light gives no heat to tran&s;parent bodies,
which the emanations from a fire do, there is rea&s;on to believe
them to be different fluids. Thus when &s;moke is blown near the
focus of a large burning gla&s;s, it does not a&s;cend: which &s;hews,
that the air is not heated and rarified by it; though it would
burn or vitrify in an in&s;tant any opake body, which might be op|po&s;ed
to it; but the emanations of heat from a fire &s;oon rarify
and warm the air in its vicinity, cau&s;ing it to a&s;cend, as may be
&s;een by a &s;piral card-vann placed over a chimney-piece, and
which is agreeably &s;een in the u&s;e of the new gla&s;s fire-&s;creens of
Pari&s;ian invention, which placed before a parlour fire permit the
rays of light to pa&s;s, but intercept the emanations of fluid heat.</P>
<P>Whence it would &s;eem, that light does not it&s;elf communicate
heat to opake bodies, when it falls on them; but combines with
them, and by that union heat is detruded or given out; which
heat may produce inflammation of the material, if it be of an
<PB N="268" REF="274">
inflammable nature, by uniting it with the oxygen of the atmo&s;|phere;
and thus producing an eduction of more heat from the
oxygen, and greater inflammation of the burning body.</P>
<P>2. Another e&s;&s;ential difference between light and heat con&s;i&s;ts
in the particular attraction of the former to oxygen; in&s;omuch
that by their union the combined or &s;olid oxygen becomes
changed into an aerial, or ga&s;&s;eous &s;tate; as con&s;tantly occurs,
when the &s;un &s;hines on the hyper-oxygenated water, which is
per&s;pired or exhaled from plants, as mentioned in Botanic
Garden, Vol. I. Cant. IV. l. 25. But as an addition of heat
&s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the conver&s;ion of a &s;olid or fluid body into
an aerial or ga&s;&s;eous one, I &s;uppo&s;e the &s;un's light at the &s;ame
time by combining al&s;o with the water &s;ets at liberty &s;ome latent
heat from it, which gives wings to the oxygen.</P>
<P>The water per&s;pired by plants, when expo&s;ed to the &s;un&s;hine,
is believed to be decompo&s;ed, as it e&s;capes from the fine extre|mities
of the exhalent or per&s;pirative ve&s;&s;els of plants; and that
the hydrogen is reab&s;orbed by the mouths of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, as
explained in Botanic Garden, Vol. I. note 34. That this hap|pens
to a certain degree is evinced by etiolated or blanched vege|table
leaves becoming green, when expo&s;ed to the &s;un&s;hine in a
few days; which is, I believe, produced by their retaining the
hydrogen of the water they per&s;pire, as it is decompo&s;ed by the
&s;un's light.</P>
<P>But it is al&s;o probable, that the per&s;pired fluid of plants is pre|viou&s;ly
hyper-oxygenated in the vegetable circulation. Fir&s;t,
becau&s;e there is never perceived any smell of hydrogen to attend
this proce&s;s of liberating oxygen by the &s;un's light. And &s;e|condly,
becau&s;e the following productions of oxygen gas by the
&s;un's light are &s;imilar phenomena; though I &s;uppo&s;e the points
or hairs on vegetable leaves may contribute to the e&s;cape of the
oxygen, as explained in Botanic Garden, Vol. I. note 10.</P>
<P>Sir Benj. Thomp&s;on, now Count Rumford, in a paper pub|li&s;hed
in Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. Vol. LXXVII. put thirty grains of
raw &s;ilk previou&s;ly wa&s;hed into &s;ome &s;pring water, and expo&s;ing it
&s;ome hours to the &s;un&s;hine obtained from it very pure vital air,
or oxygen gas. In that experiment the &s;pring water &s;eems to
have been in a &s;tate of hyper-oxygenation, and the points or

water in the &s;un&s;hine, as explained in Botanic Garden, Vol. II.
note on fucus. 2. The hyper-oxygenated marine acid is known
very ha&s;tily to part with its &s;uperabundant oxygen in the &s;un|&s;hine.
3. Mr. Scheele inverted a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el filled with co|lourle&s;s
nitrous acid into another gla&s;s-ve&s;&s;el containing the &s;ame
acid; and on expo&s;ing them to the &s;un's light, the inverted
gla&s;s became partly filled with pure air, and the acid at the &s;ame
time became coloured. Crell's Annal. 1786.</P>
<P>As water contains 85 hundreth parts of oxygen to 15 of hy|drogen,
it may become much oxygenated occa&s;ionally by a &s;mall
lo&s;s of hydrogen in the vegetable &s;y&s;tem; or by the carbonic
acid being decompo&s;ed in plants by the &s;ecretion of carbon,
which con&s;titutes &s;o great a part of them; and that on both of
th$&s;e accounts they may yield oxygen gas, when expo&s;ed to the
&s;un's light, as appears from the following experiment related from
Von U&s;lar by G. Schmei&s;&s;er. Ob&s;ervat. on Plants. Creech,
Edinburgh, p. 92.</P>
<P>If two branches of a plant are immer&s;ed, one in common wa|ter,
and the other in water impregnated with carbonie acid, we
then find, that the branch immer&s;ed in the latter yields a much
greater quantity of oxygenous gas in the &s;un&s;hine than the other.
The difference in &s;ome experiments has been found in the pro|portion
of 264 to 1. But the proportions vary when different
plants are &s;ubjected to trial. Thus the carbonic acid, with which
the water is impregnated, is decompo&s;ed by the branch, the car|bon
apparently enters into the con&s;titution of the plant, while
the oxygen is &s;et at liberty, and e&s;capes in the form of gas in the
&s;un&s;hine; but not in the night, as then the carbon is per&s;pired
along with it.</P>
<P>3. A third circum&s;tance, in which the effects of light differ
e&s;&s;entially from tho&s;e of heat, appears in the blanching or etiola|tion
of vegetables; under whatever temperature of heat a plant
is kept, it becomes white, if the light be excluded from it, and
is &s;o far di&s;ea&s;ed, as mentioned in Sect. XIV. 2. 4. Whence
all vegetables turn towards the window, if confined in a room,
and in den&s;e woods grow taller, than in open grounds, for the
purpo&s;e of acquiring acce&s;s to this nece&s;&s;ary fluid. On this &s;ub|ject
<PB N="270" REF="276">
many experiments are related by M. Senebier on vegetables
confined in a dark cavern.</P>
<P>From the experiment la&s;t related of the nitrous acid becoming
coloured, when the &s;uperabundant oxygen was volatilized by the
&s;un's light, or attracted from it; and from the experiments of
bleaching cotton by the hyper-oxygenated marine acid, where
the union of oxygen with the colouring matter &s;eems to de&s;troy
the latter by forming a new acid, which is colourle&s;s, it appears,
that the ab&s;ence of oxygen occa&s;ions the colour of vegetable bo|dies,
probably by the accumulation of hydrogen; and that on
this account, when they are &s;ecluded from the light, they be|come
white or blanched, or etiolated, by their not being in a
&s;ituation to part with &s;o much oxygen, as when they are expo&s;ed
to the light.</P>
<P>Hence plants growing in the &s;hade are white, and become
green by being expo&s;ed to the &s;un's light; for their natural co|lour
being blue, the addition of hydrogen adds yellow to this
blue, and <HI>tans</HI> them green.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e a similar circum&s;tance takes place in animal bodies;
their per&s;pirable matter is probably hyper-oxygenated; and, as
it e&s;capes in the &s;un&s;hine, lo&s;es its &s;uperabundant oxygen; and
by the hydrogen being retained the &s;kin becomes <HI>tanned</HI> yellow.
Though this mu&s;t occur in le&s;s quantity in animals, as they per|&s;pire
&s;o much le&s;s than vegetables; and the greate&s;t part of their
per&s;pired matter, which exhales from the lungs, is not expo&s;ed
to the sun's light. In proof of this it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that
both vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances become bleached white by
the &s;un-beams and water, when they are dead, as cabbage|&s;talks,
bones, ivory, tallow, bees-wax, linen and cotton cloth;
and hence, I &s;uppo&s;e, the copper coloured natives of &s;unny
countries might become etiolated, or blanched, by being kept
from their infancy in the dark, or removed for a few genera|tions
to more northern climates.</P>
<P>It is probable, that on a sunny morning much pure air be|comes
separated from the dew by means of the points of ve|getables,
on which it adheres, and much inflammable air imbib|ed
by the vegetable, or combined with it; and, by the &s;un's
<PB N="271" REF="277">
light thus decompo&s;ing water, the effects of it in bleaching
linen seem to depend; the water is decompo&s;ed by the light
at the ends or points of the cotton or thread; and the vital
air unites with the phlogi&s;tic or colouring matters of the
cloth; and produces a new acid, which is either itself colour|le&s;s,
or washes out; at the &s;ame time the hydrogen or inflam|mable
part of the water e&s;capes. Hence there &s;eems a reason,
why cotton bleaches &s;o much &s;ooner than linen; viz. becau&s;e
its fibres are three or four times &s;horter, and therefore protrude
so many more points; which &s;eem to facilitate the liberation of
the vital air from the inflammable part of the water.</P>
<P>A &s;un-flower three feet and a half high, according to the ex|periment
of Dr. Hales, per&s;pired two pints in one day, (vege|table
&s;tatics) which is many times as much in proportion to its
&s;urface, as is per&s;pired from the &s;urface and lungs of animal bo|dies;
it follows, that the vital air, liberated from the &s;urface
of plants by the &s;un&s;hine, mu&s;t much exceed the quantity of it
ab&s;orbed by their re&s;piration; and that hence they improve the
air, in which they live, during the light part of the day; and
thus blanched vegetables will &s;ooner become <HI>tanned</HI> into green
by the &s;un's light, than etiolated animal bodies will become
<HI>tanned</HI> yellow by the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>La&s;tly. This retention of the hydrogen on the &s;kins of vege|tables
and animals, when their per&s;pirable matter is decomposed
by the &s;un's light, and by which the former becomes green, and
the latter yellow, is evidently owing to the power of life; be|cau&s;e
when either of them are dead, the action of the &s;un&s;hine
on the water &s;prinkled on them again blanches them, or bleaches
them white.</P>
<P>It is hence evident, that the curious discovery of Dr. Priest|ley,
that his green vegetable matter, and other aquatic plants,
gave out vital air, when the &s;un &s;hone upon them; and the
leaves of other plants did the &s;ame when immer&s;ed in water, as
ob&s;erved by Mr. Ingenhouz, refer to the per&s;piration of vege|tables,
not to their re&s;piration. Becau&s;e Dr. Prie&s;tley observ|ed
the pure air to come from both &s;ides of the leaves, and even
from the &s;talks of a water-flag, whereas one &s;ide of the leaf
only &s;erves the office of lungs, and certainly not the &s;talks.
<PB N="272" REF="278">
Exper. on Air, Vol. III. And thus in re&s;pect to the circum|&s;tance,
in which plants and animals &s;eemed the farthe&s;t remov|ed
from each other, I mean in their &s;upposed mode of re&s;pira|tion,
by which one was believed to purify the air, which the
other had injured, they &s;eem to differ only in degree; and the
analogy between them remains unbroken.</P>
<P>4. The contest for light, as well as for air, which is &s;o visi|ble
in the growth of vegetables, as de&s;cribed in Botanic Garden,
Vol. II. note on cu&s;cuta, &s;hews the former to be of great con|&s;equence
to their exi&s;tence as well as the latter. Thus many
flowers follow the &s;un during the cour&s;e of the day by the nu|tation
of the &s;talks, not by the rotation of them, as ob&s;erved in
the &s;un-flower by Dr. Hales; and the leaves of all plants en|deavour
to turn their upper &s;urface to the light, which is their
respiratory organ, or lungs, as &s;hewn in Sect. IV.</P>
<P>The great use of all plants turning their upper &s;urfaces of
their leaves to the light is thus intelligible; the water per&s;pired
from tho&s;e furfaces is hyper-oxygenated; and, as it e&s;capes from
the &s;harp edges of the mouths of the per&s;piring ve&s;&s;els, when
acted upon by the &s;un's light, gives out oxygen; which oxygen,
thus liberated from the per&s;pired water, and added to that of the
common atmo&s;phere, pre&s;ents to the re&s;piratory terminations of
the pulmonary arteries on the upper &s;urfaces of leaves an atmo&s;|phere
more replete with vital air.</P>
<P>This nece&s;&s;ity of light to the re&s;piration of vegetables is so
great, that there is rea&s;on to believe, that many plants do not
re&s;pire during the night, but exi&s;t in a torpid &s;tate like winter
&s;leeping in&s;ects. Thus the mimo&s;a, &s;en&s;ible plant, and many
others, clo&s;e the upper &s;urfaces of their oppo&s;ite leaves together
during the night, and thus preclude them both from the air and
light. And the internal &s;urfaces of innumerable flowers, which
are their re&s;piratory organs, are clo&s;ed during the night, and
thus unexpo&s;ed both to light and air.</P>
<P>The fungi neverthele&s;s, which are termed vegetables, becau&s;e
they are fixed to the earth, or to the &s;tones, or trees, or
timber, where they are &s;ound, can exist without light or much
air; as appears in the truffle, which never appears above ground;
and by other fungi, which grow in dark cellars; and in e&s;culent
<PB N="273" REF="279">
mu&s;hrooms, which are cultivated beneath beds of &s;traw. From
this circum&s;tance of their exi&s;ting without light, and from their
&s;mell of volatile alkali, like burnt feathers, when they are burnt,
and from their taste when cooked and eaten, they &s;eem to ap|proximate
to the animal kingdom.</P>
<P>5. La&s;tly. It may nevertheless be &s;u&s;pected, that in many
of the experiments of Dr. Prie&s;tley and Dr. Ingenhouz, the
production of vital air might be &s;imply owing to the action of
the &s;un's light on the water, in which the vegetables were im|mer&s;ed,
like that from the &s;ilk in the experiment of Count
Rumford; and that the fine points, or &s;harp edges of tho&s;e
bodies, contributed only to facilitate the liberation of it, when
expo&s;ed to the &s;un&s;hine, which thus di&s;oxygenate the water by
their united effect.</P>
<P>This appears on immer&s;ing a dry hairy leaf in water fre&s;h
from a pump, innumerable globules like quick&s;ilver appear on
almo&s;t every point; for the extremities of the&s;e points attract
the particles of water less forcibly, than tho&s;e particles attract
each other; hence the contained air, who&s;e ela&s;ticity was but
ju&s;t balanced by the attractive power of the &s;urrounding particles
of water to each other, finds at the point of each &s;ibre a place,
where the re&s;i&s;tance to its expan&s;ion is le&s;s; and in con&s;equence
it there expands, and becomes a bubble of air. It is easy to
fore&s;ee, that the rays of the &s;un&s;hine, by being refracted and in
part reflected by the two &s;urfaces of the&s;e minute air-bubbles,
mu&s;t impart to them much more heat than to the tran&s;parent
water; and thus facilitate their a&s;cent by further expanding
them; and that the points of vegetables attract the particles of
water le&s;s, than they attract each other, is &s;een by the &s;pherical
form of dew-drops on the points of gra&s;s.</P>
<P>6. It may be added in this place, that there may al&s;o be a
fallacy in the &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;ults of tho&s;e experiments, where plants
have been confined in hydrogen or azote mixed with atmo&s;phe|ric
air; and have been believed to have vegetated more vigo|rou&s;ly,
and to have meliorated the air. In the&s;e experiments
I &s;u&s;pect, that the impure part of the air was attracted by the
water, and taken up by the ab&s;orbents of the roots of the plants
from the water, rather than by the ab&s;orbents of their leaves or
<PB N="274" REF="280">
&s;tems in the air; and that the melioration of the air was occa|&s;ioned,
as above de&s;cribed, by the action of the light on the
water per&s;pired from the &s;urface of the plant, or liberated by its
points from the water, with which part of it was covered. This
is rendered more probable, becau&s;e plants and &s;eeds in the ex|periments
of others cea&s;ed to vegetate in tho&s;e ga&s;&s;es, which
were totally deprived of oxygen, as in M. Scheele's experiments
on the growth of &s;eeds.</P>
<P>II. 1. The fluid matter of heat is one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive
elements in nature, perhaps next to that of gravitation; all other
bodies are immer&s;ed in it, and are pre&s;erved in their pre&s;ent
&s;tate of &s;olidity or fluidity by the different attraction of their
particles to the matter of heat, which thus counteracts the powers
of gravitation, and of chemical affinity, which would otherwi&s;e
compre&s;s them into one &s;olid chaotic ma&s;s!</P>
<P>Since all known bodies are contractible into le&s;s &s;pace by
depriving them of &s;ome portion of their heat; and as there is
no part of nature totally deprived of heat; there is rea&s;on to
believe, that the particles of bodies do not touch, but are held
towards each other by their &s;elf-attraction, or recede from each
other by their attraction to the ma&s;s of heat, which &s;urrounds
them; and thus exi&s;t in an equilibrium between the&s;e two
powers.</P>
<P>If more of the matter of heat be applied to them, they re|cede
farther from each other, and become fluid; if &s;till more be
applied, they take an aerial form, and are termed gasses; and it
is probable, that the ethereal $luid of electricity may al&s;o be dif|fu&s;ed
with heat, as well as the ethereal fluid of light.</P>
<P>Thus w$$n water is heated to a certain degree, it would in|&s;tantly
a&s;&s;ume the form of &s;team, but for the pre&s;&s;ure of the at|mo&s;phere;
which prevents this change from taking place &s;o
ea&s;ily; the &s;ame is true of quick&s;ilver, diamonds, and of perhaps
all other bodies in nature; they would fir&s;t become fluid, and
then aeriform, by appropriated degrees of heat. On the con|trary,
this ela&s;tic matter of heat, termed Calorique in the new
nomenclature of the French academicians, is liable to become
con&s;olidated it&s;elf in its combinations with &s;ome bodies, as cer|tainly
<PB N="275" REF="281">
in nitre, and probably in combustible bodies, as &s;ulphur
and charcoal.</P>
<P>This combined heat is univer&s;ally &s;et at liberty in the produc|tion
of acids by the union of oxygen with all inflammable bodies,
as &s;hewn in Sect. XII. 1. It is al&s;o taken from &s;ome bodies by
the vicinity of very cold ones, as water when frozen lo&s;es &s;ud|denly
a part of its combined heat, at the moment it becomes
ice.</P>
<P>2. It is evident, that without fluidity the blood or juices can
not circulate in animal or in vegetable ve&s;&s;els; whence &s;o great
a diminution of heat as to produce fro&s;t on this account would
de&s;troy them if long continued; at the &s;ame time too a great
deduction of heat is known to de&s;troy the irritability of animal
as well as of vegetable fibres, and mu&s;t on this account al&s;o
prevent the circulation of their fluids, and occa&s;ion the mortifi|cation
of parts of them, or the death of the whole. But when
fluids are converted into ice, the bulk of them is enlarged to a
con&s;iderable degree, and that with &s;uch violence as to bur&s;t iron
ve&s;&s;els, as bombs, which are filled with water. Whence in
this manner al&s;o fro&s;t de&s;troys tho&s;e parts of vegetables, which
are mo&s;t &s;ucculent; as the early &s;hoots of a&s;h trees, and other
young plants, are frequently de&s;troyed in the beginning of May
by a fro&s;ty night.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els of the&s;e &s;ucculent parts of plants are di&s;tended and
bur&s;t by the expan&s;ion of their frozen fluids; while the drier or
more re&s;inous vegetables, as pines, yews, aulrels, and other
evergreens, are le&s;s liable to injury from cold. The trees in
valleys are on this account more liable to injury by the vernal
fro&s;ts, than those on eminences; becau&s;e their early &s;ucculent
&s;hoots appear &s;ooner in the year.</P>
<P>Another method, by which the act of freezing may de&s;troy
vegetable life, may be by &s;eparating &s;ome part of their fluids
from other parts of them. Thus when wine, or vinegar, or &s;alt
and water, or clay diffu&s;ed in water, and perhaps milk, are
frozen; the watery part, as it congeals, protrudes from its form|ing
cry&s;tals the &s;pirit, the acid, the &s;alt, the clay, and probably
the opake particles of the milk; and by a &s;imilar proce&s;s on
vegetable and perhaps on animal fluids, when expo&s;ed to great
<PB N="276" REF="282">
cold, they may be rendered unfit for future circulation or life.
See Sect. XV. 4. 1.</P>
<P>The expan&s;ion of ice neverthele&s;s well accounts for the greater
mi&s;chief which is &s;ometimes done by vernal fro&s;t, when preceded
by much rain, or mi&s;t, or dew, as by hoar-fro&s;t, than by the
dry fro&s;ts without rime, called black fro&s;ts; as the vegetable
ve&s;&s;els are then fuller of fluids. But when mi&s;t or dew attends
a fro&s;ty night, but has not preceded it, I &s;uppose a hoar fro&s;t
may be le&s;s injurious than a black fro&s;t; as the ca&s;e of ice on
the buds of trees, or on young gra&s;s, being in&s;tantly produced,
covers them with a bad conductor of heat, and prevents them
from being exposed to &s;o great cold, as in the continuance of a
black fro&s;t without hoar or rime. See Sect. XV. 3. 5.</P>
<P>Mr. Laurence, in a letter to Mr. Bradley, complains, that
the dalemi&s;t attended with a fro&s;t on May-day had de&s;troyed all
his tender fruits; though there was a &s;harper fro&s;t the night be|fore
without a mi&s;t, that did him no injury; and adds, that a
garden not a &s;tone's throw from his own on a higher &s;ituation,
being above the dale-mi&s;t, had received no damage. Bradley,
V. II. p. 232. From this in&s;tructive fact it appears, that very
low &s;ituations even in this cold climate are not proper for the
purpo&s;es of a garden. And on the contrary, very high &s;itua|tions
are equally improper on account of their greater cold, and
the con&s;equent backwardne&s;s of their vegetable products. See
Sect. XV. 3. 5.</P>
<P>Hence fruit trees again&s;t a wall, which are covered with
coping &s;tones projecting &s;ix inches over them, are le&s;s injured
by the vernal fro&s;ts; becau&s;e their being thus &s;heltered from
the de&s;cending night-dews has prevented them from being moi&s;t
at the time, they were frozen; which circum&s;tance has given
ri&s;en to a vulgar error among&s;t gardeners, who&s;e &s;uppo&s;e fro&s;t to
de&s;cend.</P>
<P>Hence as the freezing winds of this country are from the
north-ea&s;t, a gardener &s;hould extend his rows of young peas and
beans from the &s;outh-ea&s;t to the north-we&s;t, and rai&s;e a mound
of earth behind them, and might &s;helter them occa&s;ionally with
&s;traw, placed on the ground behind the young plants, and &s;up|ported
<PB N="277" REF="283">
a few inches over them in front by poles placed horizon|tally
over the rows; remembering the old proverb,
<Q><L>The wind from north-ea&s;t</L>
<L>De&s;troys man and bea&s;t;</L>
<L>The wind from &s;outh-we&s;t</L>
<L>Is always the be&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>The immediate cau&s;e of the coldne&s;s of the N. E. winds is,
that they con&s;ist of regions of air brought from the north over
evaporating ice, and gain an apparent ea&s;terly direction, becau&s;e
they arrive at a part of the &s;urface of the earth, which moves
with greater velocity, than the &s;urface of the part of the earth,
they come from. So on the contrary the S. W. winds are
warm, as they con&s;i&s;t of regions of air brought from the &s;outh,
and gain an apparent we&s;terly direction, becau&s;e they arrive at a
part of the earth's &s;urface which moves &s;lower than the &s;urface
nearer the equator, whence they came, and of which they had
previou&s;ly acquired the velocity.</P>
<P>As the common heat of the earth in this climate is 48 de|grees,
tho&s;e tender trees, which will bear bending down, are
ea&s;ily &s;ecured from the fro&s;t by &s;preading them upon the ground,
and covering them with &s;traw or fern. This particularly &s;uits
&s;ig-trees, as they are very flexible, and as they are furni&s;hed
with an acrid juice, which defends them from in&s;ects; but I
have neverthele&s;s found them in this &s;ituation much eaten by
mice.</P>
<P>It has been believed by many, that fro&s;t meliorates the
ground; but it is now well known, that ice contains no nitrous
particles, as was formerly suppo&s;ed; and that though fro&s;t by
enlarging the bulk of &s;ome moi&s;t &s;oils may leave them more po|rous
for a time after the thaw; yet as the water exhales, the
&s;oil becomes as hard as before, being pre&s;&s;ed together by the
incumbent atmo&s;phere. And from an ob&s;ervation of Mr. Kir|wan's,
mentioned in Section XV. 4. 1. it appears, that moi&s;t
clay becomes den&s;er or more &s;olid by being frozen; and if this
&s;hould not occur, yet it would quickly become as &s;olid as be|fore
by the &s;elf-attraction of its particles, called <HI>&s;etting</HI> by the
potters; as well as by the pre&s;&s;ure of the atmo&s;phere; as its
<PB N="278" REF="284">
water exhales, and leaves vacuities between its particles. Add
to this, that on the coa&s;ts of Africa, where fro&s;t is unknown,
the fertility of the &s;oil is much &s;uperior to our own.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the commonly &s;uppo&s;ed &s;alubrity of fro&s;ty &s;ea|&s;ons
to mankind, and to other animals, the bills of mortality
are an evidence in the negative in re&s;pect to mankind, as in long
fro&s;ts many weakly and old people peri&s;h from debility, occa|&s;ioned
by the dimini&s;hed heat not being &s;ufficient to excite into
action their ve&s;&s;els previou&s;ly too inirritable; and many birds,
and other wild animals, and tender vegetables, peri&s;h benumb|ed
by the degree and continuance of the cold.</P>
<P>It &s;hould however be ob&s;erved, as fro&s;ty air is always dry,
except when frozen mi&s;ts di&s;&s;olve, as they adhere to the warmer
&s;kins of animals, that it does not generally affect us with &s;o
great a &s;en&s;ation of cold, as when air near the freezing point is
loaded with moi&s;ture; as the moi&s;ture of &s;uch air is perpetually
evaporating from our &s;kins, and produces on them a degree of
cold greater than the &s;imple contact of dry air produces, when
it is but a little beneath the freezing point. Hence fro&s;ty air is
more agreeable to tho&s;e young or strong people, who can keep
them&s;elves warm by exerci&s;e; that is, who can generate heat
by increa&s;ed &s;ecretions. But &s;evere and continued fro&s;ts de|&s;tory
the old and infirm, who cannot u&s;e much exertion; and
the children of the poor, who want both food, fire, and cloth|ing,
in this har&s;h climate.</P>
<P>It may neverthele&s;s be true, that &s;nows of long duration in
our winters may be le&s;s injurious to vegetation than great rains
and &s;horter fro&s;ts. 1. Becau&s;e great rains carry down many
thou&s;and pounds worth of the be&s;t manure into the &s;ea; whereas
&s;now di&s;&s;olves gradually, the upper &s;urface, as it thaws, &s;liding
over the under part, which remains frozen, and thence carries
away le&s;s from the land into the rivers; whence a &s;now flood
may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a rain flood by the tran&s;parency of the
water.</P>
<P>Secondly. Snow protects vegetables from the &s;everity of the
fro&s;t; &s;ince it is generally in a &s;tate of thaw, where it is in con|tact
with the earth; as the earth's heat is 48 degrees, and that of
thawing &s;now is 32$. The plants between them are generally
<PB N="279" REF="285">
kept in a degree of heat about 40, by which many of them are
pre&s;erved. On this account &s;ome plants from Siberia were
&s;aid to peri&s;h by the fro&s;ts at Up&s;al; becau&s;e the &s;nows did not
commence at the &s;ame time as in the colder climate, from which
they were brought.</P>
<P>Thus the lichen rangiferinus, coral-mo&s;s, vegetates beneath
the &s;now in Siberia, where the degree of heat is always about
40; that is in the middle between the freezing point and the
common heat of the earth. And as this vegetable is for many
months of the winter the &s;ole food of the rein-deer, who digs
furrows in the &s;now to find it; and as the milk and fle&s;h of this
animal is almo&s;t the only &s;u&s;tenance, which can be procured by
the natives during the long winters of tho&s;e higher latitudes,
this mo&s;s may be &s;aid to &s;upport &s;ome millions of mankind.</P>
<P>Snow protects vegetables, that are covered by it, from cold,
both becau&s;e it is a bad conductor of heat it&s;elf, and contains
much air in its pores. When living animals are buried in &s;now,
as &s;heep, or hares, the water, which their warmth produces,
becomes ab&s;orbed into the &s;urrounding &s;now by capillary attrac|tion,
and the creatures are not moi&s;tened by its dropping on
them; but the cavity enlarges, as the &s;now di&s;&s;olves, affording
them both a dry and a warm habitation. If this was generally
known, many cold and weary travellers in &s;nowy nights might
be &s;aved by covering them&s;elves with &s;now in&s;tead of endeavour|ing
to proceed.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be added that Ha&s;&s;enfratz has endeavoured to &s;hew
by ingenious chemical experiments, that rain water and &s;now
contain both of them a redundancy of oxygen compared with
river water, which they may have acquired in their de&s;cent
through the atmo&s;phere; and that as oxygen is &s;hewn by the
experiments of Ingenhouz and Senebier to promote the growth
of &s;eeds and of plants, he concludes, that rain water and &s;now
promote vegetation in a much greater degree than river water or
ice, which &s;eems to accord with the popular ob&s;ervations on
this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>3. Mr. John Hunter by applying thermometers to the inter|nal
parts of vegetables newly opened di&s;covered, that they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
in fro&s;ty &s;ea&s;ons a degree of heat above that of the atmo&s;|phere,
<PB N="280" REF="286">
though le&s;s than that of cold blooded animals. Whence
another deleterious effect of cold on vegetable bodies mu&s;t be
by de&s;troying their irritability, and by that means &s;topping the
ab&s;orption and circulation of their juices; in the &s;ame manner
as is &s;een in the pale b$$umbed fingers of &s;ome people, when
expo&s;ed to the cold; and which is the immediate cau&s;e of death
in tho&s;e, who peri&s;h in the &s;now in winter, which occurs long
before their fluids are frozen.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of a certain degree of heat to produce or to
pre&s;erve the activity of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of vegetables is
well evinced by the experiments of Hales and Duhamel on the
ri&s;ing &s;ap of vines in the vernal months. On a frosty day, when
the &s;un &s;hone on one of tho&s;e wounded trees, the &s;ap flowed on
the &s;outh &s;ide of the tree, but not on the north &s;ide. Phy&s;ique
des abres, Vol. II. p. 258. M. Duhamel further ob&s;erves,
that the maples in Canada, where the fro&s;t is long and &s;evere,
begin to bleed, when wounded with the fir&s;t thaw, and &s;top
again when it freezes; and that this in fro&s;ty days occurs only
on the &s;outh &s;ide of the tree.</P>
<P>This acquaints us, that one of the principal properties of heat
in re&s;pect to organic bodies, whether of vegetables or animals,
con&s;i&s;ts in its acting as a &s;timulus; and that in a greater quan|tity
than that, which the organized being has been accu&s;tomed
to, it acts as an exce&s;s of &s;timulus; and thus increa&s;es the acti|vity
of the &s;y&s;tem in re&s;pect to the ab&s;orption of its food, circu|lation
of its juices, and quantity of its &s;ecretions, and con&s;e|quently
to its more rapid growth; but all increa&s;e of &s;timulus
becomes injurious by its exce&s;s, and is certainly followed by
debility; as is &s;een in tho&s;e of our own &s;pecies, who are habi|tually
kept in too warm rooms, or are accu&s;tomed to drink
intoxicating liquors.</P>
<P>Hence a wi&s;e gardener mu&s;t regard the acquired habits of
tender vegetables; the inhabitants of his green hou&s;e, and tho&s;e
plants, which have been expo&s;ed to a greater heat for any length
of time, &s;hould be gradually cooled, and watered with &s;ubtepid
water; &s;ince expo&s;ing them to the cold of this climate is other|wi&s;e
liable to destroy their irritability and occa&s;ion their
death.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="287">
4. The great cold produced by evaporation is now well
understood. In all chemical proce&s;&s;es, where aerial or fluid
bodies become con&s;olidated, a part of the heat, which was
before latent, becomes pre&s;&s;ed out from the uniting particles;
as in the in&s;tant that water freezes, or that water unites with
quick lime. On the rever&s;e, when &s;olid bodies become fluid,
or fluid ones become aerial, heat is ab&s;orbed by the &s;olution;
whence it may be &s;aid in popular language, that all chemical
combinations produce heat, and all chemical &s;olutions produce
cold. This &s;hould teach the careful gardener not to water
tender vegetables in the heat of the &s;un&s;hine, or in a warm dry wind;
le&s;t the ha&s;ty evaporation &s;hould produce &s;o much cold
as to de&s;troy them; and that more certainly from their having
been previou&s;ly too much &s;timulated by heat, and in con&s;equence
their power of life, or irritability, having been already dimini&s;h|ed;
as further &s;poken of in Sect. XIV. 2. 2.</P>
<P>III. 1. The mechanical theory of electricity invented by
Dr. Franklin is believed by &s;ome philo&s;ophers not &s;o well to
explain the various phenomena of electricity, as may be ac|compli&s;hed
by an hypothe&s;is of the exi&s;tence of two electric
fluids diffused together, and &s;trongly attracting each other, one
of them to be called vitreous, and the other re&s;inous, electri|city.
The latter opinion I am inclined to e&s;pou&s;e, but &s;hall not
here enter into a detail of the theory; but &s;hall only ob&s;erve,
that the experiments on vegetation have been principally made
with the accumulation of the vitreous electricity only, and the
con&s;equent exclu&s;ion of the re&s;inous; that is, with what is com|monly
termed po&s;itive electricity, and not with what is termed
negative electricity. It is therefore to be wi&s;hed, that &s;ome
future experiments may be made with the re&s;inous or negative
electricity in preference to the vitreous or positive electricity,
or with both of them alternately or comparatively.</P>
<P>The influence of po&s;itive or vitreous electricity in forwarding
the germination of plants and their growth &s;eems to be pretty
well e&s;tablished; though Mr. Ingenhouz did not &s;ucceed in his
experiments, and thence doubts the &s;ucce&s;s of those of others;
and though M. Rouland, from his new experiments believes,
that neither po&s;itive nor negative electricity increa&s;es vegetation;
<PB N="282" REF="288">
both which philo&s;ophers had previou&s;ly been &s;upporters of the
contrary doctrine: for many other naturali&s;ts have &s;ince repeat|ed
their experiments relative to this object, and their new re&s;ults
have confirmed their former ones. Mr. D'Ormey and the two
Roziers have found the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s in numerous experiments,
which they have made in the two la&s;t years; and Mr. Carmoy
has &s;hewn in a convincing manner, that electricity accelerates
germination.</P>
<P>Mr. D'Ormey not only found various &s;eeds to vegetate &s;ooner,
and to grow taller, which were put upon his in&s;ulated table,
and &s;upplied with electricity; but al&s;o that &s;ilk-worms began to
&s;pin much &s;ooner, which were kept electrified, than tho&s;e of
the &s;ame hatch, which were kept in the &s;ame place and manner,
except that they were not electrified. The&s;e experiments of
Mr. D'Ormey are detailed at length in the Journal de Phy&s;ique
of Rozier, Tom. XXXV. p. 270.</P>
<P>Mr. Bartholon, who had before written a tract on this &s;ub|ject,
and propo&s;ed ingenious methods for applying electricity to
agriculture and gardening, has al&s;o repeated a numerous &s;et of
experiments; and &s;hews, that natural electricity as well as the
artificial increa&s;es the growth of plants, and the germination of
&s;eeds; and oppo&s;es Mr. Ingenhouz by very numerous and con|clusive
facts. Ib. Tom. XXXV. p. 401.</P>
<P>My friend Mr. D. Bil&s;borrow in June 1797 &s;owed mu&s;tard-&s;eed
in four garden pots at Mr. Hartop's at Dalby Hall in
Leice&s;ter&s;hire. He &s;ubjected one of the&s;e to po&s;itive or vitreous
electricity, and another to negative or re&s;inous electricity, and
ob&s;erved that the &s;eeds in the pot &s;ubjected to the negative or
re&s;inous electricity germinated a day before the pot &s;ubjected to
po&s;itive or vitreous electricity, and both of them much before
the two pots, which were not electri&s;ed, but otherwi&s;e expo&s;ed
to the &s;ame circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Nor do the injuries occa&s;ionally received from lightning in
its pa&s;&s;age through trees or corn fields from or to the earth or
clouds, which are mentioned in Sect. XIV. 2. 3. in the lea&s;t
invalidate this opinion of its general utility as well as that of the
fluid element of heat; for the exce&s;s of the mo&s;t &s;alutary &s;ti|muli
become deleterious both to vegetable and animal bo|dies.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="289">
2. Since by the late di&s;coveries in chemi&s;try there is rea&s;on
to believe, that water is decompo&s;ed in the ve&s;&s;els of vegetables;
and that the hydrogene, or inflammable air, of which it in part
con&s;i&s;ts, contributes to the nouri&s;hment of the plant, and to the
production of its oils, re&s;ins, gums, &s;ugar, &amp;c. And la&s;tly,
as electricity has by late experiments been found to decompo&s;e
water into the two airs, termed oxygen and hydrogen, there
is a powerful analogy to induce us to believe, that it acce|lerates
or contributes to the growth of vegetation; and like
he may po&s;&s;ibly enter into combination with many bodies, or
form the ba&s;is of &s;ome yet unanaly&s;ed acid.</P>
<P>3. The &s;olution of water in air or in calorique &s;eems to ac|quire
electric matter at the &s;ame time, as appears from an ex|periment
of Mr. Bennet. He put &s;ome live coals into an in|&s;ulated
funnel of metal, and throwing on them a little water,
ob&s;erved that the a&s;cending &s;team was electri&s;ed plus; and the
water, which de&s;cended through the funnel, was electri&s;ed
minus. Hence it appears, that though clouds by their change
of form may &s;ometimes become electri&s;ed minus, yet they have
in general an accumulation of po&s;itive electricity. This accu|mulation
of electric matter al&s;o evidently contributes to &s;upport
the atmo&s;pheric vapour, when it is conden&s;ed into the form of
clouds; becau&s;e it is &s;een to de&s;cend rapidly, after the fla&s;hes of
lightning have dimini&s;hed its quantity.</P>
<P>According to the theory of Mr. Lavoi&s;ier concerning the
compo&s;ition and decompo&s;ition of water, there would &s;eem
another &s;ource of thunder &s;howers; and that is, that the two
ga&s;&s;es termed oxygen gas, or vital air, and hydrogen gas, or
inflammable air, may exi&s;t in the &s;ummer atmo&s;phere in a &s;tate
of mixture, but not of combination; and that the electric &s;park,
or fla&s;h of lightning, may combine them, and produce water in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly.</P>
<P>4. A profitable application of electricity by the gardener or
agricultor to promote the growth of plants is not yet di&s;covered;
It is neverthele&s;s probable, that in dry &s;ea&s;ons the erection of
numerous metallic points on the &s;urface of the ground, but a
few feet high, might in the night time contribute to precipitate
the dew by facilitating the pa&s;&s;age of electricity from the air
<PB N="284" REF="290">
into the earth; and that an erection of &s;uch points higher in
the air by means of wires wrapped round tall rods, like angle
rods, or elevated on buildings, might frequently precipitate
&s;howers from the higher parts of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, that &s;uch points erected in gardens might pro|mote
a quicker vegetation of the plants in their vicinity by &s;up|plying
them more abundantly with the electric ether; if the
events of the experiments of the philo&s;ophers above mentioned
are to be depended upon, which may at lea&s;t be worth a further
trial.</P>
<P>5. For the purpo&s;e of keeping a few flower-pots perpetually
&s;ubject to more abundant electricity, Mr. Bennet of Wirk&s;worth
in Derby&s;hire affixeda &s;mall apparatus to the pendulum of a
clock, as de&s;cribed below with a plate; but has not yet &s;uffici|ently
attended to it to determine its effect on vegetation.</P>

We &s;hall begin with di&s;ea&s;ed irritability.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>DISEASES FROM INTERNAL CAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>I. 1. It has already been &s;hewn, that the buds of vegetables
are individual beings, and con&s;titute an inferior order of animals;
<PB N="287" REF="293">
and that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e&s;s irritability, and &s;en&s;ibi|lity,
and voluntarity, and have a&s;&s;ociations of motion; as explained in Zoono|mia,
Vol. I. Sect. XIII. But as the three latter kinds of ex|citability
are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a &s;o much le&s;s degree by vegetable buds
than by more perfect animals, we &s;hall only con&s;ider the di&s;ea&s;es
of their irritability.</P>
<P>M. Girtannir endeavoured to &s;hew, that animal irritability ori|ginates
from the oxygen, which con&s;titutes &s;omewhat le&s;s than a
third of the atmo&s;phere, which they breathe. And M. Van
U&s;lar has applied the &s;ame idea to vegetable life; and has endea|voured
to &s;hew, that their irritability al&s;o originates from the
oxygen, which they acquire either by the re&s;piration of their
leaves, or by the ab&s;orption of their roots. And indeed, as re&s;|piration
is every minute nece&s;&s;ary to animal life, there is rea&s;on to
believe, that &s;omething immediately nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of
life is acquired by the lungs of animals from the atmo&s;phere ra|ther
than from the food, which they dige&s;t; and that this, which
is believed to be the oxygen only, is mixed with the blood, and
&s;eparated again from it by the brain, and &s;pinal marrow, after
having undergone &s;ome change in the circulation or &s;ecretion of
it.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner it is not improbable, but that the &s;pirit of
vegetation may have a &s;imilar origin, probably from the uncom|bined
oxygen of the air, re&s;pired by the upper &s;urfaces of their
leaves; and not from that, which is ab&s;orbed by their roots in a
more combined &s;tate; and that this oxygen is again &s;eparated
from their juices by the &s;en&s;orium, or brain, of each individual
bud, after having undergone &s;ome change in the circulation or
&s;ecretion of it. See Sect. IV. 1. 2.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances attending vegetable irritability are &s;imilar to
tho&s;e belonging to the irritability of animals upon a le&s;s exten&s;ive
&s;cale, as detailed in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XII.</P>
<P>When vegetable fibres have been long &s;timulated more than na|tural
or u&s;ual by increa&s;e of heat, the &s;pirit of vegetation becomes
exhau&s;ted; and in con&s;equence a &s;lighter degree of cold will de|&s;troy
them; becau&s;e their fibres after having been long excited
by a greater &s;timulus will cea&s;e to act on the application of one,
which is much le&s;s; whence after hot days tender plants are more
<PB N="288" REF="294">
liable to be de&s;troyed by the coldne&s;s of the night. Whence in
more northern, climates the gardeners &s;hade their tender vegeta|bles,
as the flower of apricots, in the &s;pring-fro&s;ts from the me|ridian
fun, as well as from the coldne&s;s of the night; which is
generally the greate&s;t about an hour before &s;unri&s;e.</P>
<P>In the hot days of June 1798 I twice ob&s;erved &s;everal rows
of garden beans become quite &s;ickly, and many of them to die,
from being flooded for an hour or two with water from a canal in
the neighbourhood; which I a&s;cribed more to the &s;udden appli|cation
of too great cold, after bring much enfeebled, or render|ed
inirritable, by the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;ea&s;on, than to the
too copious &s;upply of water to the dry ground; to which &s;hould
be added, that &s;ome plants are more liable to be thus injured than
others; as the &s;trawberries, young cabbage plants, and onions,
which were in the &s;ame &s;ituation, received benefit and not deteri|oration
by being thus occa&s;ionally watered in that dry &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>On the contrary, when plants have been long expo&s;ed to a le&s;s
&s;timulus of heat than natural or u&s;ual, the &s;pirit of vegetation
becomes accumulated; and if they are too &s;uddenly &s;ubjected to
much greater heat, their too great increa&s;e of action induces in|flammation,
and con&s;equent mortification, and death; as oc|curs
to tho&s;e people, who have had too much warmth applied to
their frozen limbs. Experiments of this kind were in&s;tituted by
Van U&s;lar; he increa&s;ed the irritability of euphorbia peplus and
e&s;ula by &s;ecluding light and heat from them; and, when he ex|po&s;ed
them to a meridian &s;un, they became gangrenous, and died
in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>This greater or le&s;s irritability of plants is to
be a&s;cribed to their previous habits in re&s;pect to the &s;timulus of greater or le&s;s

&s;pring &s;eem occa&s;ionally to be influenced by their previou&s;ly ac|quired

the roots of potatoes, onions, will germinate with much le&s;s heat
in the &s;pring than in the autumn; as is ea&s;ily ob&s;ervable, where
the&s;e roots are &s;tored for u&s;e, and hence malt is be&s;t made in
the &s;pring, as the barley will then germinate with a le&s;s degree of
heat.</P>

It was ob&s;erved by one of the &s;cholars of Linneus, that

(Kalm's Travels.) Vines in grape hou&s;es, which have been ex|po&s;ed

rapid vegetation in the northern latitudes after the &s;olution of the

<P>The increa&s;e of the irritability of plants in re&s;pect to heat,
after having been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to cold, is farther illu&s;trated
by an experiment of Dr. Walker's. He cut apertures into a
birch-tree at different heights; and on the 26th of March &s;ome
of the&s;e apertures bled, or oozed with the &s;ap-juice, when the
thermometer was at 39; which &s;ame apertures did not bleed on
the 13th of March, when the thermometer was at 44. The
rea&s;on of this I apprehend was, becau&s;e on the night of the 25th
of March the thermometer was as low as 34; whereas on the
night of the 12th of March it was at 41; though the ingenious
author a&s;cribes it to another cau&s;e. Tran&s;act. of the Royal So|ciety

<P>There is an ob&s;ervation in Mr. Tull's work, which he ingeni|ou&s;ly
a&s;cribes to the acquired habits of plants. &startq;By the ex|tremely
hard winter of the year 1708 or 1709, &s;ome lucern in
Languedoc was killed, along with all the olive trees and walnut
trees by the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on; though I could not
hear that one walnut tree was killed in England. Perhaps
tho&s;e in France having been accu&s;tomed to much hotter &s;ummers

<P>By adapted experiments Medicus is &s;aid to have found, that the

<PB N="290" REF="296">
of the day, and much le&s;s in the evening. And Von U&s;lar
found, that their irritability in re&s;pect to their contractions was
increa&s;ed in cool and rainy weather. Ob&s;erv. on Plants by

to heat after being previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to cold; as our hands
glow on coming into the hou&s;e after having for a while being im|mer&s;ed
in &s;now; and many in&s;ects, and other animals, which
hide them&s;elves in the earth, and &s;leep during the winter, were
ob&s;erved by M. Spallanzani to di&s;appear at a &s;ea&s;on, when the
heat of the atmo&s;phere was much higher than in the &s;pring, when
they again made their appearance.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that plants, which are kept in a warm room
during winter, &s;hould occa&s;ionally be expo&s;ed to cooler air to in|crea&s;e
their irritability; as otherwi&s;e their growth in the &s;pring is
ob&s;erved to be very tardy. Mankind for the &s;ame rea&s;on requires
the perpetual variations of the heat of the atmo&s;phere to pre&s;erve
or re&s;tore the irritability, and con&s;equent activity, of the &s;y&s;tem.
Whence the health and energy of men are greater, and their
lives longer, in this variable i&s;land, than in the tropical continents,
which po&s;&s;e&s;s greater warmth, and le&s;s variation of weather.</P>
<P>2. Linneus in the Philo&s;ophia Botanica has given names to
but four internal di&s;ea&s;es, euri&s;iphe, mildew; rubigo, ru&s;t;
clavus, ergot, or &s;pur; and u&s;tilago, &s;mut; to which may be
added many others as de&s;cribed below.</P>
<P>Ery&s;iphe, a white mucor, or mould, or mildew, with &s;e&s;&s;ile
tawny heads, with which the leaves are &s;prinkled; this is fre|quent
in humulus, hop; lamium, dead nettle; gallop&s;is, arch-angel;
litho&s;permum, &s;tone-&s;eed; and acer, maple. This
mucur is a plant of the fungus kind, which will grow without
light, or change of air, like other fungu&s;es; and with its roots
penetrates the ve&s;&s;els of the vegetables to which it adheres.&mdash;
But the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are probably previou&s;ly injured by internal di&s;|ea&s;e.
The methods of preventing or de&s;troying it mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t
in thinning the plant, or removing tho&s;e in its vicinity, &s;o as to
admit more light, and greater ventilation, which may at the
&s;ame time eradicate the mildew, and re&s;tore the internal vigour
of the p$ant.</P>
<P>As the greater dampne&s;s of &s;ame land &s;upplies one permanent
cau&s;e of mildew, as well as its being too much over&s;hadowed by
<PB N="291" REF="297">
thick foliage, the methods of prevention mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in properly
draining the land, and u&s;ing drier kinds of manure, as coal-a&s;hes
and bone-a&s;hes, as well as by thinning the crops. And la&s;tly, it
is recommended to &s;ow early in the &s;ea&s;on for the purpo&s;e of
procuring forward crops; as this di&s;ea&s;e is &s;aid more to injure
late crops owing to the greater dampne&s;s of the ground in autumn.</P>
<P>3. Rubigo, ru&s;t, a ferruginous powder &s;prinkled under the
leaves, frequent in alchemilla, lady's mantle, rubus &s;exatilis,
e&s;&s;ula degener; and particularly in &s;enecio or jacobaea; and e&s;|pecially
in a burnt woody &s;oil.</P>
<P>This is probably another fungus &s;imilar to the former, or to
&s;ome kinds of lichen, which grows beneath the leaves of vege|tables
previou&s;ly di&s;ea&s;ed, and may probably be prevented or de&s;|troyed
by expo&s;ing the plant to more light, and greater ventilla|tion,
as in the mucor above mentioned.</P>
<P>An account is given by Mr. Lambert in the Tran&s;actions of
the Linnean Society, Vol. IV. of a di&s;ea&s;e which may probably
be &s;omewhat &s;imilar to the rubigo, which he calls uredo frumen|ti,
or blight of wheat, and de&s;cribes it to be a fungus, which
covers the &s;tems of wheat in wet &s;ea&s;ons, when it is nearly ripe,
&s;o as to give the field an appearance of being covered with foot.
The &s;tem of the wheat is &s;aid to appear to be &s;plit, and the growth
of the plant to be much injured. He de&s;cribes the fungus to be
linear-oblong, tawny-black.</P>
<P>4. Clavus, ergot, or &s;pur, occurs when &s;eeds grow out into
large horns, black without, as in &s;ecale, rye, and in carex.
This di&s;ea&s;e frequently affects the rye in France, and &s;ometimes
in England, in moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, and is called ergot, &s;pur, or horn-&s;eed;
the grain becomes con&s;iderably elongated, and is either
&s;traight or crooked, containing black meal along with the white;
and is &s;aid to appear to be pierced by in&s;ects, which are &s;uppo&s;ed
to cau&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Duhamel a&s;cribes it to this cau&s;e, and compares it to galls
on oak-leaves; but this has not yet been e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;ufficient
ob&s;ervations. By the u&s;e of this bad grain among&s;t the poor,
di&s;ea&s;es have been produced, attended with great debility, and
mortification of the extremities, both in France and England.

5. U&s;tilago, &s;mut, when the fruit in&s;tead of &s;eed produces a
black meal, as in wheat, barley, oats, &s;corzonera, tragopogon.
Much $s &s;aid on this di&s;ea&s;e in the Dict. Rai&s;on of Bomare. Art.
Bled, who recommends &s;teeping the grain, before it is &s;own, in
brine; which is generally directed to have &s;o much &s;alt added to
the water, as may increa&s;e its &s;pecific gravity, till an egg will
&s;wim in it; or &s;econdly, to &s;teep the &s;eed-wheat in lime water;
or thirdly, which he thinks mo&s;t efficacious, in an alkaline ley
made by adding pot-a&s;h to lime-water.</P>
<P>In the &s;y&s;tema naturae of Linneus under the article Vermes,
Zoophyta, Chaos u&s;tilago, there is a quotation from Munchhau|&s;en,
that the u&s;tilago is a black powder, which is found in the
de&s;troyed grains of barley, wheat, and other gra&s;&s;es; and in the
florets of tragopogon &s;corzonera. And that this powder being
macerated in warm water for &s;ome days pa&s;&s;es into oblong animal|cules,
hyaline in re&s;pect to colour, and playing about like fi&s;h, as
may be &s;een by a micro&s;cope; and are again mentioned in Lin|neus's
di&s;&s;ertation on the invi&s;ible world.</P>
<P>There is an ingenious paper in the publications of the Bath
Society, in which the author ob&s;erves, that the &s;mut in wheat
only happens, when wet weather occurs at the time of the flower|ing
of the wheat; which may bur&s;t the anthers, and wa&s;h away
the farina. He thinks that &s;teeping the wheat in brine or lime
water is an ancient error, and can be of no u&s;e but to &s;eparate
light wheat from that which is good.</P>
<P>For he found &s;mutty ears and good ones growing from the &s;ame
root; and thence it could not depend on any contagious material,
or in&s;ects eggs, adhering to the &s;eed; and in &s;ome even the &s;ame
ear contained both &s;ound and &s;mutty corns. And la&s;tly, that
&s;ome of the corns had one end &s;mutty, and the other &s;ound;
and he concludes, that it mu&s;t be owing to the want of impreg|nation
from the defect of the farina fecundans; and that the
putrefaction &s;ucceeded the death of the grain.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;ervations of Spallanzani on leguminous plants the
probability of this opinion is much confirmed. He found that
the &s;eed was produced by the female organ of the plant, long
before it was impregnated; which could not happen, till the
flower was open, and the anther-du&s;t ripe. Whence it is ea&s;y
<PB N="293" REF="299">
conceive, that for want of impregnation, or the vivifying prin|ciple,
the wheat-corn mu&s;t putrefy like the addle eggs of poultry,
which are unimpregnated, and thence die, and in con&s;equence
putrefy.</P>
<P>If this di&s;ea&s;e of &s;mut &s;hould become a &s;erious evil, it might
po&s;&s;ibly be prevented by &s;owing the grain in di&s;tant rows; and
after &s;ome days &s;owing other rows between them of the &s;ame,
or of another kind of wheat; by which means, if wet weather
&s;hould de&s;troy the anthers of one &s;et of rows, the alternate ones
might &s;upply farina to their &s;tigmas, if the weather became fa|vourable.
See Sea. XVI. 8. 2.</P>
<P>Wheat di&s;coloured by &s;mut may be wa&s;hed, and readily dried
on a malt kiln, and may be thus ea&s;ily made marketable and
equally good; for the living grain will not ab&s;orb much water in
a &s;hort time; or it may be mixed with clean &s;and, and after be|ing
well agitated the &s;and may be &s;eparated by a riddle; and if
nece&s;&s;ary the &s;ame &s;and may be wa&s;hed and dried for repeated
u&s;e.</P>
<P>6. Be&s;ides the four internal di&s;ea&s;es above &s;poken of, as men|tioned
by Linneus; and the uredo of Mr. Lambert, there are
probably many others, which have not yet been &s;ufficiently at|tended
to, as the canker, gangrena; the honey-&s;weat, ex&s;udatio
mellita; the miliary &s;weat, ex&s;udatio miliaris; the &s;ap-flow,
fluxus umbilicalis; and the gum &s;ecretion, &s;ecretio gummo&s;a.</P>
<P>The canker, which may be termed gangrena vegetabilis, is a
phagedenic ulcer of the bark; which is very de&s;tructive to ap|ple-trees,
and pear-trees, as it &s;preads round the trunk or
branches, and de&s;troys them.</P>
<P>Mr. Knight has ob&s;erved this di&s;ea&s;e to be mo&s;t frequent and
fatal to tho&s;e trees, the fruit of which has been long in fa&s;hion;
as they have been perpetually propagated for a century or two by
ingrafting; which he believes to be a continuation of the old
tree, though nouri&s;hed by a new &s;tock; and that the canker is
thus a di&s;ea&s;e of old age, like the mortification of the limbs of
elderly people, and ari&s;es from the irritability of a part of the
&s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems more probably to be an hereditary di&s;ea&s;e, as the
buds of trees being a lateral progeny, and more exactly re&s;em|bling
<PB N="294" REF="300">
their parents, mu&s;t be more liable to the di&s;ea&s;es gradually
acquired or increa&s;ed by the influence of &s;oil or climate; and
have not the probability of improvement, which attends the pro|geny
of &s;exual generation.</P>
<P>It is neverthele&s;s frequently produced on trees by external vio|lence,
as by a &s;troke with a &s;pade by a carele&s;s labourer, who is
digging near them; but this probably may more ea&s;ily affect the
old grafts above mentioned. When a de&s;truction of the bark is
thus produced by external violence, it may po&s;&s;ibly be cured by
the application of a piece of living bark from a le&s;s valuable tree,
bound on as mentioned in the next article, and in Sect. XVII.
3. 10.</P>
<P>The edges of the&s;e gangrenous ulcers of the bark &s;hould be
nicely pared with a knife, &s;o as to admit the air, and to prevent
the depredations of in&s;ects and the lodgment of moi&s;ture, which
might promote the putrefaction of the &s;tagnant juices, and &s;pread
the gangrene; this &s;hould be &s;o managed as only to cut away the
dead lips of the wound, but not &s;o as in the lea&s;t to injure the liv|ing
bark. Some thick white paint may then be &s;meared on the
naked alburnum or &s;ap-wood on a dry day, which may prevent
in&s;ects from in&s;erring their eggs into it, and produce maggots,
which erode and de&s;troy the wood; and may al&s;o prevent the
dews and rains from rotting it. The paint &s;hould neverthele&s;s
be &s;o &s;pread, as not to touch the edges of the wound; as it might
injure their growth by its poi&s;onous quality; a quarter
of an ounce of &s;ublimate of mercury, hydrargyrus muriatus, rubbed with
about a pound of white lead paint, might render it more noxi|ous
to in&s;ects. See Sect. XVII. 3. 9. and 10.</P>
<P>7. The honey-dew, which may be called &s;uffu&s;io mellita, con|&s;i&s;ts
of a &s;accharine juice, which I have &s;uppo&s;ed to be ex&s;uded
from the tree by the retrograde motions of the cutaneous lympha|tic
ve&s;&s;els, connected either with the common &s;ap-ve&s;&s;els de&s;crib|ed
in Sect. II. or with the umbilical ve&s;&s;els de&s;cribed in Sect. III.

the diaboetes mellitus, or to the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s of the la&s;t cen|tury.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="301">
The &s;accharine and nutritious quality of the honey-dew, &s;imi|lar
to that of the &s;ap-juice, which ri&s;es in the vernal months from
the birch and maple, is evident from its ta&s;te; and from the
number of bees and ants, which are &s;aid to feed on it, when it
appears on &s;ome trees; and which &s;hews, that its ex&s;udation
mu&s;t be con&s;iderably injurious to the tree, as before mentioned
in Sect. VI. 6. 3.</P>
<P>In a paper written by the Abb&eacute; Boi&s;&s;ier de Sauvages, he de&s;|cribes
two kinds of honey-dew; one of which he concludes to
be an ex&s;udation from the tree, and the other he a&s;&s;erts to be the
excrement of one kind of aphis, which the animal projects to
the di&s;tance of &s;ome inches from its body on the leaves and
ground beneath it; and which he believes the animal acquires by
piercing the &s;ap-ve&s;&s;els of the leaf. This paper is detailed in
Wildman's work on Bees, p. 46. The circum&s;tances are di&s;|tinctly
de&s;cribed, and by &s;o great a philo&s;opher as Sauvages of
Montpellier, that it is difficult to doubt the authenticity of the
fact. But that a material &s;o nutritive &s;hould be produced as the
excrement of an in&s;ect is &s;o totally contrary to the &s;tronge&s;t ana|logy,
that it may neverthele&s;s be &s;u&s;pected to be a morbid ex&s;u|dation
from the tree; though the&s;e in&s;ects may occa&s;ionally prey
upon it, and void it almo&s;t unchanged at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, becau&s;e
the in&s;ects continued &s;ome months after the honey-dew cea&s;ed,
and before it commenced, as mentioned below; and the upper
&s;urfaces of the leaves became covered with a black powder,
which had before been covered with the honey-dew. And la&s;tly,
becau&s;e on other trees, as on the peach and nectarine, at other
&s;ea&s;ons of the year, no honey-dew is perceived, though the aphis
much abounds to the great injury of the trees.</P>
<P>Early this morning, June 18, 1798, I ob&s;erved a remarkable
honey-dew on an exten&s;ive row of nut-trees, corylus avellana,
which grow by the &s;ide of a pond of water; the &s;un &s;hone
bright, and the upper &s;urface of every leaf, which was illumi|ned
by the &s;un, was covered with a vi&s;cid juice, which ta&s;ted as
&s;weet as diluted honey. From many of the&s;e leaves large drops
hung from the point, and during that day and the following one
much of this honey dropped down &s;o as to moi&s;ten the gravel
walk beneath the branches of every tree, and &s;eemed more fluid
<PB N="296" REF="302">
as the &s;un&s;hine became warmer; and the leaves, which were
concealed from the &s;un, appeared to have le&s;s of the honeys-dew,
and &s;ome of them none of it.</P>
<P>How long this honey-dew had continued before I ob&s;erved it,
I cannot tell, but probably many days, as the weather was then,
and had been uncommonly dry and warm, and &s;hining; and
after two or three days, when the weather changed, the mor|bid
ex&s;udation, if &s;uch it was, or the excrementitious depo&s;ition
of this vi&s;cid honey, became checked and gradually di&s;appear|ed.</P>
<P>Beneath every leaf of this exten&s;ive hedge of filberts I di&s;|cerned
fifty or a hundred aphi&s;es of all &s;izes, and many of them
had wings; but I could not perceive, that any of them had
been on the upper &s;urfaces of the leaves, where the honey only
exi&s;ted; nor were any bees, or butter-flies, or ants, about
the&s;e leaves; on which they mu&s;t have adhered, if they had
&s;ettled; which po&s;&s;ibly they were aware of, as a hive of bees was
at no great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>M. Duhamel ob&s;erved a &s;imilar &s;weet juice drop in &s;uch
quantity from willows by the &s;ide of a river in very hot and dry
weather, that children were bu&s;y in catching or gathering it,
and that it ta&s;ted like manna, but was more agreeable. He
al&s;o mentions its dropping from nut-trees. Phy&s;ique des arbres,
Vol. I. p. 150. M. Reneaume, in the Memoirs of the Academ&punc;
des Sciences, ob&s;erved a &s;imilar ex&s;udation from the maple,
and &s;ycamore; and adds, 1. That it was unctuous and &s;weet.
2. That it was in the greate&s;t quantity on the leaves expo&s;ed to
the &s;un, which appeared wet on their upper &s;urfaces; and that
it was not &s;een before &s;un-ri&s;e. 3. That bees collected it as
anxiou&s;ty as common honey. 4. And that &s;ome leaves died,
who&s;e di&s;charge was very great. 5. That it exi&s;ted in a very
dry and hot &s;ea&s;on. But neither of the&s;e philo&s;ophers &s;peak of
its being attended by the aphis.</P>
<P>The aphis this year was uncommonly numerous, the leaves
of the peach and nectarine trees were half of them de&s;troyed by
this pernicious in&s;ect, and became bli&s;tered and curled I &s;up|po&s;e
by their punctures; which were made &s;ome weeks earlier
in the year, and by an aphis without wings, and differing &s;ome|what
<PB N="297" REF="303">
what in their &s;hape, but without any appearance of honey-dew
on tho&s;e trees. But I could not di&s;cover any punctures or other
di&s;ea&s;e of the leaves of the&s;e nut-trees, and therefore doubt whe|ther
the&s;e in&s;ects, though &s;o numerous on the under &s;urface of
every leaf, could be the cau&s;e of the morbid ex&s;udation, if &s;uch
it was, on their upper &s;urfaces; and the more as I could not
di&s;tingui&s;h, that they preyed upon the honey thus produced;
and I afterwards ob&s;erved that they continued in immen&s;e num|bers
under every leaf, when the weather became cooler, and
moi&s;ter, and the honey-dew cea&s;ed to be vi&s;ible. But after a
few weeks I ob&s;erved the upper &s;urface of every leaf became
covered with a black powder like &s;oot; whether this was a new
material, or remained after the exhalation of the honey-dew, I
did not determine by experiment. But if both the honey-dew
and this &s;ub&s;equent black powder on the upper &s;urfaces of the
leaves, were the excrement of the aphis on the under &s;urfaces
of the leaves over the former, or owing to an ex&s;udation from
the tree, mu&s;t be determined by further ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>But as a &s;econd period of &s;ap-flow is believed to exi&s;t about
mid-&s;ummer, or a depo&s;ition of vegetable nutriment for the new
buds, as de&s;cribed in Sect. III. 2. 8. there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;|pect,
that the honey-dew is owing to the inverted action of the
external lymphatics occa&s;ioned by the debility induced by the
continued heat, and perhaps to the moi&s;ture of &s;ituation.
Whence the nutritive fluid is thrown upon the external habit
in&s;tead of being applied to nouri&s;h the new buds, or to be laid
up as a re&s;ervoir for their u&s;e. And that if it be voided by the
aphis, it is owing to their puncturing the &s;ap-ve&s;&s;els with the
fine probo&s;cis, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, at this &s;ea&s;on only, or in a

<P>8. Ex&s;udatio miliaris, miliary &s;weat, appears to be produced
by too great and continued heat, as it exi&s;ts on vines in hot-hou&s;es,
which are kept too warm, or too clo&s;e in re&s;pect to their
ventilation.</P>
<P>This &s;ecretion has not the &s;weet ta&s;te like that of the honey-dew,
but con&s;i&s;ts of mucilage; which, as the watery part eva|evaporats
<PB N="298" REF="304">
by heat, remains on the plant in very &s;mall round hard
globules, like millet &s;eeds, whence their name, I once witne&s;&s;ed
a very &s;imilar appearance of minute hard round globules on the
&s;kin in a miliary fever, which ea&s;ily were rubbed off with the
finger; and were probably occa&s;ioned, as in this vegetable
di&s;ea&s;e, by too great heat, and the exclu&s;ion of air, as de&s;cribed
in Zoonomia, Vol. II. Cla&s;s 2. 1 3. 12.</P>
<P>In the evaporation of per&s;pirable matter, which in its di&s;ea&s;ed
&s;tate may be more mucilaginous than natural, in confined bed|rooms
or hot-hou&s;es, I &s;uppo&s;e, the aqueous part only is ex|haled,
and the mucilaginons part remains in the form of a glo|bule;
in the &s;ame manner as &s;talactites are formed on the roof
of caverns from a &s;olution of calcareous earth in water, &s;imply
by the evaporation of the water.</P>
<P>9. Fluxus umbilicalis, &s;ap-flow, this occurs, when the albur|num
or &s;ap-wood of trees is wounded in the vernal months, as
in birch and maple, de&s;cribed in Sect III. 2. 2. and con&s;i&s;ts
of a &s;accharine and mucilaginous fluid &s;imilar to the honey-dew,
or &s;uffu&s;io mellita; and is often very trouble&s;ome, when vines
in hot-hou&s;es are pruned too late in the &s;ea&s;on, as the whole
branch is liable to bleed to death, owing thus to the lo&s;s of the
&s;ap-juice, which ought to be employed in nouri&s;hing the young
buds, and expanding their leaves.</P>
<P>When &s;ome perennial plants have ri&s;en but a certain height
from the ground, if their &s;tems are much wounded, or cut off,
the roots are liable to bleed to death from this di&s;charge of the
umbilical fluid, or &s;ap-juice, which ought to have nouri&s;hed and
expanded the new buds and foliage; as may be &s;een in cutting
down the heracleum &s;pondylium, cow par&s;nep, in April; and
on this account it has been recommended to mow down thi&s;tles,
and other weeds, which are trouble&s;ome from their numerous
increa&s;e, early in the &s;pring; as many of them will then die,
and the re&s;t be much weakened by the &s;ap-flow, which attends
their wounds at that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to trees another period of &s;ap-flow is &s;aid to exi&s;t,
when the new buds are forming after Mid&s;ummer, as &s;poken of
in Sect. III. 2. 8. Whence wounds at this &s;ea&s;on al&s;o mu&s;t be
injurious; where this lo&s;s of &s;ap-juice occurs in hot-hou&s;es vari|ous
<PB N="299" REF="305">
applications have been recommended by gardeners. I &s;u&s;|pect
that a bit of &s;ponge bound upon the end of the cut branch,
or on the wound, by means of &s;ome ela&s;tic bandage, mu&s;t be the
mo&s;t certain application; or a wire twi&s;ted round the end of the
branch cut off, &s;o tightly as to &s;trangulate the whole circulation
of juices, and con&s;equently de&s;troy the part above the liga|ture.</P>
<P>10. Secretio gummo&s;a, gum &s;ecretion, a morbid production
of gum, which differs from the &s;ap-juice above de&s;cribed, as it
contains no &s;accharine quality, though like the former it ex&s;udes
from the wounded alburnum of deciduous trees; whether the
wound be originally cau&s;ed by internal di&s;ea&s;e, or by external
violence, as mentioned in the gangrene of the bark above de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Where this happens to cherry-trees, prunus cera&s;us, a gum
ex&s;udes like gum arabic; which in dry weather hardens, as it
adheres, and thus prevents the further di&s;charge of this nutri|tive
material; otherwi&s;e the tree weeps away its life, peri&s;h|ing
from deficient nouri&s;hment. In &s;imilar manner a re&s;in is
emitted from the injuries or wounds of pine trees, and &s;ome
other evergreens, with great injury to the growth, or the de|&s;truction
of the tree.</P>
<P>This ex&s;udation of the gum or re&s;in of trees, as it happens
chiefly in &s;ummer, is probably a part of nutritious fluid de&s;igned
for the new buds, which in mo&s;t deciduous trees are formed
about this time, and &s;hould be prevented from continuing to
flow by binding on the part, previou&s;ly made &s;mooth by a knife,
a metallic plate, as of the lead in which tea is wrapped, &s;o as
to prevent rain or dew drops from di&s;&s;olving the indurated gum.
A bit of &s;ponge, or of &s;oft leather, or of Indian rubber, caout|chouc,
might be bound on under the lead, till the wound is
healed. Might not a &s;trong &s;olution of green vitriol in water,
or &s;ome ink, if applied to the extremities of the&s;e bleeding ve&s;|&s;els,
&s;timulate them into contraction, and prevent the further
effu&s;ion of gum?</P>
<P>Another method might be worth trial, which is mentioned
in Sect. XVII. 3. 10. A piece of bark from a &s;imilar tree of
inferior value might be cut out, &s;o as nicely to $it the wounded
<PB N="300" REF="306">
part, after its edges were nicely &s;moothed, and might be tied
on by a proper bandage, as the li&s;ting cut from the edges of
cloth, or flannel, &s;o that its ela&s;ticity might &s;ecure a perpetual
pre&s;&s;ure without injury.</P>

<HEAD>II. DISEASES FROM EXTERNAL ELEMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>1. In climates liable to ince&s;&s;ant rains or perpetual drought
for a length of time many di&s;ea&s;es of vegetables mu&s;t originate
from the exce&s;s of moi&s;ture, or to the want of it; which are not
very frequent in this country. In moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons the leaf-buds
of plants, as of gra&s;s and corn, as well as of trees and pe|rennial
vegetables, grow too luxuriantly; and the flowers and
con&s;equent fruits or &s;eeds are later, and contain more aqueous,
and le&s;s mucilaginous and &s;accharine matter.</P>
<P>On the contrary, in dry &s;ea&s;ons the leaf-buds are le&s;s vigo|rous,
and therefore in le&s;s quantity, as the crops of hay, and
the quantity of &s;traw; but the fruits and &s;eeds ripen earlier, and
are of more grateful flavour, and more nutritious.</P>
<P>2. The effect of heat on vegetation is &s;poken of in Sect.
XIII. 2. 2. The exce&s;s of that element is &s;eldom much inju|rious
to the vegetation of this country, unle&s;s it may contribute
to increa&s;e the dryne&s;s of the &s;oil, when there is a &s;carcity of
moi&s;ture. But the defect of the element of heat, or in com|mon
language exce&s;s of cold, is frequently de&s;tructive to the
early &s;hoots of the a&s;h, fraxinus, and to the early blo&s;&s;oms of
many fruit-trees, as apples, pears, apricots; as the&s;e are either
more &s;ucculent, or have le&s;s irritability, or more &s;en&s;ibility; on
both which accounts they are more liable to be di&s;ea&s;ed by
cold.</P>
<P>The blights occa&s;ioned by fro&s;t generally happen in the
&s;pring, when cold nights &s;ucceed to warm &s;unny days, as the
living power of the plant has then been previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted
by the &s;timulus of heat, and is therefore le&s;s capable of being ex|cited
into the actions, which are nece&s;&s;ary to vegetable life, by
the greatly dimini&s;hed &s;timulus of a freezing atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>In &s;ome northern climates, where the long &s;unny days &s;uc|ceed
the di&s;&s;olving of the &s;nows, as in Denmark and in Ru&s;&s;ia,
<PB N="301" REF="307">
the gardeners are &s;aid to &s;helter their wall-trees from the meri|dian
&s;un in the vernal months; which pre&s;erves them from the
cold of the &s;ucceeding night; and by preventing them from
flowering too early avoids the danger of the vernal fro&s;ts.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of the more &s;ucculent parts of vegetables,
as their early &s;hoots, and that e&s;pecially when expo&s;ed to fro&s;ty
nights, was &s;poken of in Sect. XIII. 2. 2. and can only be
counteracted by covering them from the de&s;cending dews or
rime by the coping-&s;tones of a wall, or mats of &s;traw.</P>
<P>3. The bla&s;ts occa&s;ioned by lightning are more frequent, I
believe, than is u&s;ually &s;uppo&s;ed; as I am informed by tho&s;e,
who purcha&s;e exten&s;ive woods, that very many trees on being
&s;awed through are found cracked, and much injured by light|ning.
I had la&s;t year a &s;tandard apple-tree, and a tall apricot-tree,
in full leaf bla&s;ted at the &s;ame time by lightning, as was
believed. They both lo&s;t all their leaves; the apple-tree never|thele&s;s
put out a new foliage, and recovered, and bore fruit
this year; but the apricot, which was nailed to a high wall,
never &s;hewed any returning life.</P>
<P>Mr. Tull a&s;cribes one injury to the health of wheat$plants,
and frequently their death, to lightning; the effects whereof,
he &s;ays, may be ob&s;erved by the blacki&s;h parts or patches vi&s;ible
in a field of wheat, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e years which have more
thunder-&s;torms than u&s;ual, and adds that again&s;t this there is
no remedy.</P>
<P>The erection of frequent metallic points could alone &s;ecure a
garden or field from this misfortune; which probably occurs
more frequently on damp &s;ituations, than on dry ones; as men|tioned
in the account of Fairy Rings in Botanic Garden, Vol. I.
note XIII.</P>
<P>The manner in which lightning de&s;troys the life of vegetables
may be &s;imilar to that, in which it de&s;troys animal life; which
is I &s;uppo&s;e by its great &s;timulus exhau&s;ting the &s;en&s;orial power
in the violent action it occa&s;ions, and thus producing total in|irritability
to the common &s;timuli, which ought to excite the
vital actions of the &s;y&s;tem; &s;imilar to which, though with le&s;s
expedition, &s;eems to be the effect of &s;ome poi&s;ons on the animal
&s;y&s;tem, as the di&s;tilled water of lauro-cera&s;us, a &s;olution of
<PB N="302" REF="308">
ar&s;enic, the contagious matter of fevers, and even a common
emetic; all which by their &s;trong &s;timulus &s;eem almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly
to render the &s;tomach, and other parts of the &s;y&s;tem,
nearly or entirely inirritable, or di&s;obedient to their natural
&s;timuli.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o affect vegetables in another way &s;imilar to that,
which probably al&s;o happens, when their young &s;ucculent &s;hoots
are frozen; that is, by bur&s;ting their ve&s;&s;els, as it pa&s;&s;es through
them, by its expan&s;ive power; as it happens to the large
branches of &s;ome trees, and to &s;tone-buildings, and other bad
conductors of electricity, when they are &s;truck with light|ning.</P>
<P>The expan&s;ive power of electricity is not only &s;hewn by trees
and towers being rent by lightning, but by the &s;ound, which
&s;ucceeds the pa&s;&s;age of it through air; &s;ince a vacuum, or nearly
a vacuum, in re&s;pect to air mu&s;t previou&s;ly be made by the pre|&s;ence
of the electric fluid; and the &s;ides of this vacuum ru&s;hing
together, when the &s;tream has pa&s;&s;ed, occa&s;ions the con&s;equent
vibrations of the air, which con&s;titute &s;ound, whether in the
audible &s;park of electricity, or the tremendous cra&s;h of thunder.
See Sect. XIII. 3.</P>
<P>4. The element of light, as well as that of heat, is nece&s;&s;ary
to vegetation. In this climate they both &s;eem in general to be
injurious only by their defect, and &s;eldom by their exce&s;s.
But as light acts as a &s;timulus on the more irritative or &s;en&s;itive
parts of plants, which appears by the expan&s;ion of many flowers,
and of &s;ome leaves, when the &s;un &s;hines on them; and by the
nutation of the whole flower, as of the &s;un-flower, helianthus;
and by the bending of the &s;ummits of all plants confined in
hou&s;es towards the light; there may be di&s;ea&s;es owing to the
exce&s;s of this &s;timulus, which have not been attended to; to
prevent which the flowers of tragapogon &s;al&s;a&s;i, and of other
plants, clo&s;e about noon. Other unob&s;erved di&s;ea&s;es may be
owing to a defect of the &s;timulus of light; as a mimo&s;a, &s;en&s;itive
plant, which I had confined in a dark room, did not open its
foliage, though late in the day, till many minutes after it was
expo&s;ed to the light.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="309">
The exce&s;s of light has not been ob&s;erved to be attended by
vegetable di&s;ea&s;es in the&s;e more northern latitudes; but the
di&s;ea&s;e produced by the deficiency of it, which is termed etio|lation,
or blanching, has been &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed to render &s;ome
vegetable leaves and &s;talks e&s;culent by depriving them of much
of their acrimoney, and of their cohe&s;ion, as well as of their
colour; as is &s;een in the blanching of celery, apium; endive,
cichorium; cinara, cardoon; &s;ea-cale, crambe.</P>
<P>The following method of the growth and etiolation of &s;ea-cale
is tran&s;cribed from the letter of a friend; to which &s;hould be
added, that the young heads of this vegetable without blanching
are equal or &s;uperior to mo&s;t kinds of brocoli, bra&s;&s;ica. &startq;Sea-cale
&s;hould be &s;owed the latter end of March or beginning of
April in drills, and then earthed up. In autumn it &s;hould be
tran&s;planted into high beds, one row of roots in a bed, about
a foot a&s;under, and in the winter it &s;hould be covered up. It
mu&s;t be kept dry, that is, the beds made in the drie&s;t ground;
it is not fit to be eaten till the third year after it is &s;owed. The
year before it is eaten it mu&s;t be covered up in the beginning of
winter, fir&s;t with &s;table dung, which may be kept from pre&s;&s;ing
on it by a few &s;ticks placed like a cone over each root; then
with long litter two or three feet high; the higher the better,
becau&s;e the more it is forced, the earlier it is fit to be gathered,
and the whiter it will be. It is to be gathered about the be|ginning
of January and &s;o on till May, one bed being kept
under another. It &s;hould be boiled and &s;ent up on toa&s;t like
a&s;paragus, and is an excellent vegetable, and at an early &s;ea|&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>5. The earth, on which vegetables in&s;ert their roots, &s;ome|times
pre&s;ents noxious materials to their ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, as the
acidity of &s;ome clays; into which when the roots of &s;ome fruit
trees penetrate, they are &s;aid to lo&s;e their health, as mentioned
in Sect. II. 9. by the death or decay or their root-fibres.</P>
<P>Pure &s;iliceous &s;ands al&s;o prevent vegetation from their con|taining
no carbonaceous matter, and by their &s;o readily permit|ting
the dews and rains to exhale from them, e&s;pecially in hot|ter
climates, where they con&s;titute a moving &s;urface unfriendly
to all organized life.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="310">
6. There are al&s;o noxious exhalations diffu&s;ed in the atmo&s;|phere
in the neighbourhood of &s;ome manufactories; which are
&s;aid to injure the growth or de&s;troy the life of vegetables; as
the &s;moke from the furnaces, in which lead is &s;melted from the
ore, from potteries, and from lime-kilns; to which may be
added the marine &s;alt, or marine acid, which abounds in the
too great vicinity of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>To the&s;e belong the experiments of Dr. Pe&s;chier of Geneva,
who immer&s;ed &s;everal plants in vapours of nitrous acid, of vo|latile
alkali, and of ether, to the great injury or death of the
plants. Journal de Phy&s;ique par Delametherie, T. ii. p. 345.</P>
<P>7. Unwhole&s;ome or poi&s;onous materials may be applied to
vegetables &s;o as to di&s;ea&s;e or de&s;troy them; as their ab&s;orbent
&s;y&s;tems like tho&s;e of animals are liable to imbibe many noxious
materials, as mentioned in Sect. II. 8. A &s;light &s;olution of
ar&s;enic, &s;prinkled on a peach-tree in the &s;pring, de&s;troyed the
branches which received it. A &s;olution of liver of &s;ulphur was
equally fatal to the branches of a nectarine-tree, and al&s;o oil of
turpentine.</P>
<P>Mr. Von U&s;lar affirms, that watering plants with a due quan|tity
of oxygenated muriatic acid will increa&s;e their irritability;
and if carried beyond a certain degree will injure or de&s;troy
the vegetable by giving it too much oxygen; which is known in
due quantity to be a &s;alutary material; and the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary
of all others to vegetable as well as to animal life.</P>
<P>8. There are materials called condiments, which are believed
to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;timulus without nutriment in re&s;pect to animal bodies,
as &s;pice, &s;alt, bitters, as the hop, and probably opium and
vinous &s;pirit. The&s;e&punc; when taken into the &s;tomach increa&s;e its
activity, and render the animal for a time fat, and even &s;trong;
but as all increa&s;e of &s;timulus, beyond what is natural, is fol|lowed
by debility; after a time the animal becomes weak and
emaciated; and enervated in mind as well as body; as is uni|formly
&s;een in tho&s;e who are addicted to the u&s;e of much beer
and wine, or of opium; and in a le&s;s degree where &s;pice, or
&s;alt, or bitters, are taken in too large quantity.</P>
<P>What then &s;hall we &s;ay to the u&s;e of common &s;alt in agricul|ture?
as it is a &s;timulus, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no nouri&s;hment, but may
<PB N="305" REF="311">
incite the vegetable ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els into greater action; it may
in a certain quantity increa&s;e their growth by their taking up
more nutriment in a given time, and performing their circula|tions
and &s;ecretions with greater energy. In a greater quantity
its &s;timulus may be &s;o great as to act as an immediate poi&s;on on
vegetables, and de&s;troy the motions of the ve&s;&s;els by exhau&s;ting
their irritability.</P>
<P>After a time I &s;u&s;pect vegetables will always be liable to di&s;|ea&s;e
from this &s;timulating innutritive material; and that though
it may increa&s;e the early growth of the plant, it will injure its
flowering or &s;eed-bearing; and that hence, if it be u&s;ed at all,
it &s;hould be a little before the time, that the plant would acquire
that part of its growth, which is wanted. Thus if the herb or
young &s;tem only be wanted, as in &s;pinage, mercury, a&s;paragus,
apply &s;alt early; if the flower be wanted, as in brocoli and arti|choke,
or in tulip or hyacinth, moi&s;ten them with a &s;light &s;olu|tion
of &s;alt, when the flower-bud is formed. When the fruit
or &s;eed is wanted, as in melons or cucumbers, or peas and
beans, apply the &s;olution of &s;alt &s;till later, and at all times with
rather a par&s;imonious hand. See Sect. X. 7. 4.</P>
<P>Similar to this, where animals di&s;ea&s;ed with &s;uperabundancy
of fat are required, it is cu&s;tomary, I am told, to feed poultry
for the London markets by mixing gin and even opium with
their food, and to keep them in the dark; but they mu&s;t be
killed as &s;oon as their corpulency is formed, or they &s;oon be|come
weak, and emaciated like human drunkards. And in &s;ome
countries, as in Languedoc in France, the livers of gee&s;e and
ducks are required to be enlarged and di&s;ea&s;ed; as they are
reckoned a dainty by modern epicures, as well as by the an|cient
ones, who &s;peak of the tumidum jecur an&s;eris; and for
this purpo&s;e the animals are kept in the dark, and crammed
with more than their natural quantity of nutriment; but are &s;aid
to become lean, and to die, if not killed as &s;oon as this di&s;ea&s;e
is produced.</P>
<P>It is neverthele&s;s to be ob&s;erved, that &s;ea-&s;alt as well as
other &s;timulating condiments may be advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed as
medicines, though injurious as common food. Thus it is a&s;&s;erted
by Baron Schulz in the communications to the board of Agri|culture,
<PB N="306" REF="312">
Vol. I. Part III. and IV. p. 318, that it de&s;troys
the fa&s;ciola hepatica, or flewk-worm in &s;heep. Some have re|commended
one ounce of &s;alt to be given every day di&s;&s;olved
in water, but it is probable, it might be u&s;ed with greater ad|vantage,
if hay was moi&s;tened with the &s;olution, which would
thus at the &s;ame time &s;upply them with better nouri&s;hment than
generally falls to the lot of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;ed &s;heep, on &s;uppo&s;ition
that they would eat it.</P>
<P>The rot of &s;heep, I &s;u&s;pect, ari&s;es from the inactivity of the
ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the liver of that animal; whence the bile
is too dilute, e&s;pecially in moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons; whence the flewk-worm,
as I have &s;een in the &s;hambles, inhabits the common bile-duct
and at length erodes the liver, cau&s;ing ulcers; which
from the &s;ympathy of the lungs with the liver occa&s;ions a cough,
and a hectic fever from the ab&s;orption of the matter. Hence
the &s;alt by its additional &s;timulus may render the bile le&s;s dilute
by promoting a greater ab&s;orption of its aqueous parts, as well
as a greater &s;ecretion of it; which however I &s;u&s;pect would be
much more efficacious, if about &s;ixty grains of iron-filings made
into a ball with flower was given every morning for a week
along with the &s;alt, as further explained in Zoonomia, Part III.
Art. 4. 2. 6. 4.</P>
<P>Since writing the above account of common &s;alt as a condi|ment,
and the probable con&s;equences attending the u&s;e of it,
I have met with &s;ome experiments publi&s;hed by Lord Kaimes
in his Gentleman Farmer, which &s;eem much to confirm the
preceding account. He watered &s;ome Jeru&s;alem artichokes,
helianthus tubero&s;us, which were planted in &s;eparate pots, with
a &s;olution of fixed vegetable alkali, others with volatile alkali,
others with weak lime water, others with &s;trong lime water,
others with putrid urine, and la&s;tly others with water impreg|nated
with putrid animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, I &s;uppo&s;e as
they exi&s;t in a dunghill. All the&s;e &s;aline &s;olutions at fir&s;t en|couraged
the growth of the re&s;pective plants, &s;o as much to &s;ur|pa&s;s
tho&s;e in the pot, which was moi&s;tened only with common
water, as a &s;tandard to compare the others to; but by additional
quantities of the &s;olutions, they all, except the la&s;t, gradually
<PB N="307" REF="313">
lo&s;t their vigour, and peri&s;hed in the end, as I &s;uppo&s;e, by the
exce&s;s of &s;timulus.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o an experiment in the works of Mr. Ander&s;on
which &s;eems to &s;hew, that common &s;alt po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no nutritive qua|lity
adapted to vegetable growth; and that in &s;ome &s;oils, or to
&s;ome vegetables, it would &s;eem not even to act as a &s;timulus or
condimen. He, marked out a circle of &s;ix feet diameter in the
middle of a gra&s;s field, which he di&s;tingui&s;hed by driving a &s;take
in the centre; on this circle he &s;trewed common &s;alt, &s;o as to
lie nearly an inch thick on the ground. The gra&s;s &s;prung up
in this circle in the &s;ame manner as in the other parts of the
ground, and the place could only be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;take,
though it was left there for &s;ome years. Encycl. Britan. Art.

is worthy to be repeated, le&s;t there might have been &s;ome
mi&s;take attending it; as &s;o many authors have given experiments
with contrary re&s;ults; and as &s;ome other neutral &s;alts were &s;hewn
to promote vegetation in the experiments of Dr. Home.</P>
<P>9. Some di&s;ea&s;es from external violence have been already
mentioned in this Section, in which the injury is a remote
rather than a proximate cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, as in the canker
&s;ometimes, and the &s;ap-flow, and gum-&s;ecretion. But &s;ome
other di&s;ea&s;es from external violence have been purpo&s;ely pro|duced,
as well as that of etiolation, and turned to advantage;
as the bunches of grapes, which have acquired their full &s;ize,
are &s;aid to ripen &s;ooner, if the &s;talk of the bunch be cut half
through. Tournefort &s;ays, that the figs in Provence and about
Paris ripen &s;ooner, if the buds be wounded with a &s;traw dipped
in olive-oil. And la&s;tly, the figs in the i&s;land of Malta are
made to ripen &s;ooner by caprification; as &s;poken of in Botanic
Garden, Vol. II. note on Caprificus. And it may daily be
remarked, that tho&s;e apples and plums ripen &s;ooner, which
have been wounded by in&s;ects; and that pears will ripen con&s;i|derably
&s;ooner, if they be immaturely plucked from the tree,
which mu&s;t be e&s;teemed injurious to the life of the pear; and
as the conver&s;ion of au&s;tere acid juices of fruit into &s;ugar in the
proce&s;s of ripening may be in part chemical, it may proceed more
ha&s;tily, when the life of the fruit is impaired or de&s;troyed; as
<PB N="308" REF="314">
&s;eems to occur in the drying of germinated barley, and in baking
pears, as well as in brui&s;ing apples for the purpo&s;e of making
cyder; which la&s;t effect might probably be much improved by
the addition of warmth.</P>

<HEAD>III. DISEASES OCCASIONED BY INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>1. Among the di&s;ea&s;es of plants Linneus adds in his Philofo|phia
Botanica the ne&s;ts of tho&s;e in&s;ects, which depo&s;it their eggs
in plants; whence a variety of excre&s;cences. The&s;e are, 1.
The galls of oak, of ground-ivy, ci&s;tus, trembling poplar, wil|low,
and hawk-weed. 2. Bedequar of ro&s;es, or briar-balls.
3. Follicles of pi&s;tachia, and black poplar. 4. Contortions of
cera&s;tium, chick-weed, veronica, &s;peedwell, and lotus. 5.
Scales of firs, willows, and ro&s;es.</P>
<P>He then adds, that die duplicature and prolification of flowers
is often occa&s;ioned by in&s;ects, as common chamomile, matri|caria,
is thus made proliferus; and that carduus caule cri&s;po
bears larger florets, with the pi&s;tils growing into leaves, by
he wounds of in&s;ects.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e excre&s;cences on the leaves of
&s;ome plants, or mutation of their manner of growth, are not
always the con&s;equence of a &s;imple wound or puncture of the
in&s;ects, but of the depo&s;ition of their eggs, or young offspring;
which afterwards continue to &s;timulate the growing plant into
unnatural motions, and con&s;equently into unnatural growth;
like the inflammation and con&s;equent new granulations of fle&s;h
in the wounds of animal bodies; which, if the &s;kin is prevented
from &s;preading over them, will ri&s;e into large &s;ubsfances of
f$ngous fle&s;h; or beneath the &s;kin, where it is loo&s;e, as in
wens.</P>
<P>Many flowers are de&s;troyed or rendered unprolific by the
depredation of in&s;ects, as ro&s;e-buds by the cynips; and I re|member
ob&s;erving one dry &s;ummer, that every blo&s;&s;om of a
large quince tree was pierced by a fly, and rendered unproli&s;ic
before the blo&s;&s;oms had opened. I have al&s;o &s;een the hood of
the aconite, &s;o replete with an acrid juice, pierced by in&s;ects to
plunder it of its honey.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="315">
2. The curling of the leaves of nectarine, and peach, and
cherry-trees, with the cells or bladders on their &s;urfaces, are
formed in con&s;equence of the wounds inflicted by the aphis;
in the &s;ame manner as the galls and bedeguars on the oak and
&s;weet-briar by other in&s;ects, but without their nidification or
the depo&s;ition of their eggs; though from the &s;udden and gene|ral
appearance of the&s;e injuries they have been a&s;cribed to blights
from inclement weather.</P>
<P>Some ob&s;ervers have believed neverthele&s;s, that the&s;e affected
leaves were previou&s;ly out of health; which occa&s;ioned them
to &s;upply a proper &s;ituation for tho&s;e in&s;ects, which mole&s;t them:
as I have frequently ob&s;erved, that &s;nails or &s;lugs eat tho&s;e
leaves, which have been plucked from cucumber plants, and
are beginning to wither; in preference to tho&s;e, which are
growing in perfect health.</P>
<P>Mr. Lawrence relates, that in June the leaves of &s;ome of his
wall-pear-trees were much injured by a hail-&s;torm, which leaves
were afterwards blighted, and become full of tumours from
in&s;ects; and the pears, which were then as large as walnuts,
all peri&s;hed. On this Mr. Bradley remarks, that in&s;ects gene|rally
lay their eggs on the dead or putrefying parts both of vege|table
and animal bodies; and adds a conjecture, that the parent
in&s;ects may circulate in the juices of the plant, which however
is not probable, as though micro&s;copic animals have been di&s;|covered
in the &s;tagnating juices of animal bodies, as in the pu&s;|tules
of the itch, and in the faeces in the dy&s;entery, and even
in the &s;emen, which may have &s;tagnated in the ve&s;iculae &s;emina|les;
yet no &s;uch animalculeae have, I believe, ever been detected
in recent blood, or any recent &s;ecretions from it.</P>
<P>A predilection for &s;ome withered leaves appears al&s;o in larger
animals as well as in in&s;ects; cows will eat young thi&s;tles,
a few hours after they are cut down, as their prickles become
flaccid; and hor&s;es refu&s;e the young &s;hoots of yew-trees, as they
grow; but will eat them when they are cut off, and begin to
wither; and on that account lo&s;e a part of their acrimony;
though there is &s;till often &s;ufficient poi&s;on within them to de|&s;troy
the animal. And it is even probable, that when the leaves
of yew are withered to a greater degree, their poi&s;onous acri|mony
<PB N="310" REF="316">
becomes &s;o far de&s;troyed, that they cea&s;e to be deleterious
to hor&s;es; &s;o that in He&s;&s;e in Germany it is cu&s;tomary in the
winter to crop the young &s;hoots of yew-trees, and mixing them
with other provender to give them as common food to hor&s;es.
See Ander&s;on on Agriculture, Vol. III. p. 590.</P>
<P>On this account if wall-trees are frequently watered by an
engine, &s;o as to moi&s;ten their leaves or branches as well as the
ground at their roots on the dry days in &s;pring, by which they
will be kept in vigorous growth, I was told, that they would
totally or nearly e&s;cape the depredations of in&s;ects; but I found
by an experiment well conducted on three trees, that this
management had no effect; and I al&s;o ob&s;erved in the &s;pring
and &s;ummer of this year, 1798, which &s;eems to have much
favoured the production of the aphis, that they attacked the
mo&s;t healthy leaves of peach and nectarine trees, as well as the
others; and that plums, cherries, black currants, and many
other trees &s;uffered by their depredations, though previou&s;ly in
perfect vigour. And la&s;tly, that on repeatedly having wa&s;hed
off many thou&s;ands of aphi&s;es from peach and nectarine leaves
by a &s;trong &s;tream from a forcible water-engine, that they evi|dently
crawled again up the &s;tems of the trees, or on the wall
to which they were nailed, as in another day the lowermo&s;t
branches were thus more infe&s;ted with them than the upper
ones.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the aphis, puceron, or vine-fretter, is &s;o cu|rious,
the de&s;truction it commits on the foliage of the peach and
nectarine is in dry &s;ummers &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, and its exi&s;tence on
other trees &s;o exten&s;ive, that it demands our particular attention.
See No. 1. 7. of this Section. From the ob&s;ervations of Swam|merden,
Bonnet, Dr. Richard&s;on, and of other philo&s;ophers,
this extraordinary in&s;ect ri&s;es in the &s;pring from eggs, which
are &s;aid to be attached by the parent aphis to the twigs of trees
in the autumn, and are believed to produce not a larva or cater|pillar,
but a progeny &s;imilar to the parent; every one of which
produces in about ten days not an egg, but another living pro|geny
to the ninth generation, without being connected amato|rially
with each other. The ninth generation produces males
and females, &s;ome of both kinds with wings, and others without
<PB N="311" REF="317">
them; and this tenth generation from tho&s;e, which-were hatched
from eggs, become amatorially connected, and produce eggs;
which are laid on the new twigs of various trees for the next
year's progeny to be hatched by the vernal &s;un. Philo&s;. Tran&s;act.
Vol. LXI. p. 182.</P>
<P>In this uncommon circum&s;tance the eggs of the aphis re&s;emble
the &s;eeds of plants; which fir&s;t produce &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;ive genera|tions
of leaf buds, which are a viviparous progeny, before they
again produce &s;eeds, which are their oviparous progeny, as
mentioned in Sect. IX. 3. 1. of this work. Nor is this to be
a&s;cribed to what has been termed equivocal generation, or to
an impregnation of nine fetu&s;es enclo&s;ed within each other, as
&s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed. But this central production of the vivipa|rous
progeny of the aphis &s;eems to re&s;emble the lateral produc|tion
of a viviparous progeny from the polypus, which in time
detach them&s;elves from their parents; like the buds&punc; of the poly|gonum
viviparum, or the bulbs of the magical onion, allium
magicum; which are produced from the flower-cup in&s;tead of
&s;eeds, and in time detach them&s;elves, and fall on the ground.
So that the&s;e aphi&s;es are not, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be e&s;teemed fecun|dated
females, but proliferous males, as explained in Zoonomia,
Vol. I. Sect. 39. on generation.</P>
<P>This double mode of reproduction, &s;o exactly re&s;embling the
buds and &s;eeds of trees, accounts for the wonderful increa&s;e of
this in&s;ect; which according to Dr. Richard&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of ten
generations, and of fifty at an average in each generation; &s;o that
the &s;um of fifty multiplied by fifty, and that product again mul|tiplied
by fifty nine times, would give the product of one egg
only in countle&s;s millions; to which mu&s;t be added the innu|merable
eggs laid by the tenth generation for the renovation of
their progeny in the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>Their punctures of the leaves of peach and nectarine trees
in the vernal months, and of cherry, plum, and currant trees
in the &s;ummer, produce a &s;welling and elevation of the cuticle
of the leaf on its upper &s;ide, and a con&s;equent curling of it with
its upper &s;urface outwards, which terminates in a de&s;truction of
it to the great injury of the tree, and frequently to the death
of it; while the leaves of the nut-trees, mentioned above, in
<PB N="312" REF="318">
No. 1. 7. of this &s;ection, appeared to be but little injured by
them, though fifty or a hundred of the&s;e in&s;ects were &s;een under
every leaf about Mid&s;ummer, both before and after their affu&s;ion
with the honey-dew.</P>
<P>From Dr. Richard&s;on's account the aphi&s;es on the ro&s;e-tree
appeared in February, when the weather happened to be warm,
from &s;mall black oval eggs; which were depo&s;ited on the la&s;t
year's &s;hoots in autumn; and that, when the weather became
colder, great numbers of them peri&s;hed, by which circum&s;tance
the ro&s;e-trees are in &s;ome years almo&s;t freed from them.</P>
<P>They came to their full growth before April, and after hav|ing
twice ca&s;t off their exuviae, every one of them produced
about fifty young ones; all of which came into the world back|wards,
and adhered &s;ometime to the vent of the parent by their
mouths or forepart; as &s;hewn in a magnified &s;tate at fig. 2. plate
IX; and were at length &s;et down on &s;ome tender &s;hoots of the
plant, and came to maturity in about ten days, ca&s;ting off their
coats two, three, or four times.</P>
<P>The ninth generation in October con&s;i&s;ted of males as well
as females, which were &s;een to cohabit; and the eggs produced
by their intercour&s;e, he a&s;&s;erts, were depo&s;ited generally near
the new buds, or on other parts of the twigs of the trees, which
they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The&s;e were at fir&s;t green, but in a few days
became brown, and by degrees quite black. They were of
regular oval figures about one tenth of an inch in length, and
about half as broad, and adhered firmly by means of &s;omething
glutinous, and re&s;i&s;ted the &s;everity of the winter.</P>
<P>Other in&s;ects, which are produced from eggs, and become
winged butterflies or moths, live for &s;ome time in the inter|mediate
&s;tate of caterpillars or larvae. During this &s;tate of their
exi&s;tence they feed on the leaves, on which they are hatched;
or on fruits or kernels; but after they have acquired wings and
organs of reproduction, &s;ome of them take no food, as the &s;ilk-worm;
and others live only upon honey, as bees, and moths,
and butterflies. Now the aphis, I &s;uppo&s;e, has no intermediate
&s;tate between the egg and the fly, and therefore makes no holes
in the leaves by eating them; or if any of them previou&s;ly exi&s;t
in a caterpillar, or larva &s;tate, it can be only tho&s;e which are
<PB N="313" REF="319">
produced from eggs in the early &s;pring, which is worthy of fu|ture
attention.</P>
<P>Whence I &s;uppo&s;e, that this fly lives not by con&s;uming the
foliage of the plants, which it inhabits; but by piercing the
pulmonary ve&s;&s;els in their natural &s;tate, or the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els
of the leaf in their retrograde &s;tate, by a &s;ine tube or probo&s;cis,
which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and which it may be &s;een by a common lens
perpetually to employ, as &s;hewn under its chin in the magnified
in&s;ect at figure fir&s;t of plate IX. For the &s;ap-juice or vegetable
chyle is brought from the radicles of each leaf-bud, and propel|led
up the long caudex to the pulmonary artery of the leaf,
where it becomes oxygenated, and converted into vegetable
blood. And may thus be extracted by the tubes of the&s;e in&s;ects
before its &s;anguification.</P>
<P>Perhaps tho&s;e aphi&s;es, which were from eggs, might eat &s;ome
part of the peach leaves during their larva &s;tate, if &s;uch exi&s;ts,
and occa&s;ion them to curl up. While tho&s;e, which were a vi|viparous
progeny, might only pierce the &s;ap-ve&s;&s;els, or blood-ve&s;&s;els,
and thus not apparently injure the leaves; as on the nut-trees,
where perhaps they were not hatched from eggs, but
might have come thither in their winged &s;tate, and have then
produced their innumerable viviparous offspring; as on the nut-trees
above mentioned I could not di&s;cern the eggs, from which
they were hatched, and a few larger aphi&s;es with wings ap|peared
early in the &s;eason among&s;t the &s;maller ones without
wings.</P>
<P>We may finally conjecture on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, fir&s;t,
that the aphi&s;es produced from eggs early in the &s;pring may
have a larva or caterpillar &s;tate, and that during that &s;tate they
may feed on the young leaves of peaches, nectarines, plums,
and cherries, and thus occa&s;ion them to curl and die. 2. That
tho&s;e, which are not from eggs, have no larva &s;tate, and only
puncture the larger chyle ve&s;&s;els of the young twigs, or the
pulmonary arteries of the leaves, which receive the vegetable
&s;ap-juice from the roots, and thus that they &s;uck it up, and live
on it, before it is converted into blood, as moths, butterflies,
and bees, live on honey in their winged &s;tate, though on other
parts of vegetables, as on their leaves, or anther-du&s;t, in their
<PB N="314" REF="320">
larva &s;tate; and that the&s;e punctures are attended with no vi&s;ible
injury to the leaf. 3. That for a week or two about Mid&s;um|mer,
when the umbilical ve&s;&s;els of the new buds convey the
&s;ap-juice to them, or to the re&s;ervoirs of nutriment preparing for
them, that the aphi&s;es by piercing the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, or the pulmo|nary
arteries of the leaves, acquire &s;o large a quantity of this
&s;accharine material, that it pa&s;&s;es through them almo&s;t unchang|ed,
falling on the leaves and ground beneath them, and pro|duces
what is called the honey-dew; but that this happens only
for a &s;hort &s;eason, as a week or two about Mid&s;ummer, during
the production of the new buds. And la&s;tly, that the black
powdery material on the upper &s;urfaces of the leaves of the nut-trees
and plum-trees, and of the &s;hrubs which grow beneath
them, is an excrement from the aphi&s;es, which hang on the
under &s;urfaces of the leaves above them, like the black bitter
powder in the nut-&s;hell; which is the excrement of the cur|cul$o,
which has eaten the &s;weet kernel.</P>
<P>Secondly, having la&s;t year written the above, I have had
another opportunity of attending to the aphis during the &s;um|mer
of 1799, and &s;hall add the further remarks, which I have
been able to make on this mo&s;t curious and important animal,
which may in proce&s;s of time de&s;troy the vegetable world.</P>
<P>As the month of June was again in this &s;ummer very dry,
though not very warm, the aphis was propagated in immen&s;e
numbers on a great variety of trees, &s;hrubs, and herbaceous
plants. The row of nut-trees mentioned in No. 1. 7. of this
Section was infe&s;ted with a greater number of them this year
than in the preceding one; yet during the &s;ea&s;on about Mid&s;um|mer
there was &s;o little honey-dew this year, that it might have
e&s;caped ob&s;ervation, if it had not been particularly attended to;
yet what did appear was only on the upper &s;urfaces of tho&s;e
leaves which had other leaves impending over them crowded
with aphi&s;es; whence I had no doubt, but that it was voided
by the millions of aphi&s;es, which adhered on the under &s;urfaces
of tho&s;e &s;uperior leaves with their backs downwards.</P>
<P>On examining them with a &s;trong magnifier I could frequently
perceive them in&s;ert their probo&s;cis or trunk into the ve&s;&s;els of
$e inferior &s;urface of the leaf; and particularly ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="315" REF="321">
when they were not moving from place to place, that they gene|rally
&s;tood with their heads towards the foot-&s;talk of the leaf of
nut-trees, or towards the ba&s;e of the twigs of plum-trees, which
circum&s;tance I &s;hewed to many of my friends.</P>
<P>Both before and after the exi&s;tence of the honey-dew a black
material, which was &s;ometimes moi&s;t and &s;ometimes dry, ap|peared
on the upper &s;urfaces of tho&s;e leaves only, which had
other leaves crowded with aphi&s;es over them, and even on the
upper &s;urface of the leaves of &s;ome herbaceous plants, which
grew under the&s;e nut-trees, and al&s;o on others, which grew
under plum-trees, which were much infe&s;ted with an aphis of a
greener colour.</P>
<P>To prove beyond po&s;&s;ibility of error that this black matter
was dejected on the leaves below by the aphi&s;es, which were
walking with their heads downwards on tho&s;e above, I &s;ewed
&s;lightly with a needle and thread under &s;everal leaves a piece
of writing paper about the &s;ize of the leaf; and ob&s;erved on
the next day that many black marks were di&s;tingui&s;hable on the
paper.</P>
<P>On plum-trees and on many herbaceous plants innumerable
aphi&s;es were &s;een on the upper tender part of the upright &s;hoots,
adhering with their heads downwards; and on the hanging
&s;hoots with their heads upwards; and in&s;erting their probo&s;cis
into the ve&s;&s;els, I &s;uppo&s;e, which contained the a&s;cending &s;ap-juice.
But on the nut-trees the mo&s;t tender or uppermo&s;t parts
of the young &s;hoots were covered with very numerous bri&s;tles,
which appeared to be an armour purpo&s;ely produced to defend
them from the&s;e de&s;tructive in&s;ects, and hence they were princi|pally
found on the under &s;urfaces of the leaves.</P>
<P>As the chyle of animals is mixed with the venous blood,
and is immediately projected by the force of the heart into the
pulmonary artery, at the extremities of which it is principally
converted into blood by its expo&s;ure to the air; &s;o in the vege|table
&s;y&s;tem the &s;ap-juice mu&s;t be mixed with the returning ve|nous
blood, and carried forwards to the extremities of the pul|monary
artery of the leaf, before it is converted into vegetable
blood. The&s;e pulmonary arteries pa&s;s along the under &s;urfaces
of leaves, as the upper &s;urfaces of them are covered by the fine
<PB N="316" REF="322">
terminations of them on an air-membrane for the purpo&s;e of
re&s;piration; hence on the&s;e under &s;urfaces of leaves the aphi&s;es
adhere, and pierce the branches of the pulmonary arteries with
their probo&s;cis &s;tanding with their heads towards the &s;talk, of
the leaf, that they may thus meet the &s;treams of chyle or
&s;ap-juice yet unchanged into blood; which accounts both for
their exi&s;ting in all kinds of weather on the inferior &s;ide of the
leaves, and for their &s;tanding with their heads towards the foot-&s;talks
of them. Thus on an upright twig of a plum-tree I this
day ob&s;erved a number of aphi&s;es adhere with their heads down|wards
with their probo&s;ci&s;es in&s;erted into the tender &s;tem, and
&s;o near to each other, that the tail part of the lower ones ex|tended
one third of their length over the head part of tho&s;e
above them, and gave &s;omewhat the appearance of &s;cales;
while on the hanging twigs they adhered with their heads up|wards,
&s;till intent to meet the &s;treams of &s;ap-juice in the a&s;cend|ing
chyle ve&s;&s;els, or in the pulmonary arteries.</P>
<P>Dr. Bradley and others ob&s;erve, that about Mid&s;ummer there
appears to be a pau&s;e in vegetation, and at this time the new
buds are generated; and Duhamil and others found, that the
bark of &s;everal trees became at this time as ea&s;ily to be &s;eparated
from the alburnum as in the &s;pring; as is related in Sect. III.
2. 8. of this work. At this time therefore there exi&s;ts a new
flow of &s;ap-juice to &s;upply pre&s;ent nutriment, or to furni&s;h a re|&s;ervoir
of future nutriment to the newly generated or expected
embryon, either before or after its vivification, or its impregna|tion,
if &s;uch a proce&s;s may be &s;uppo&s;ed to occur in the produc|tion
of buds.</P>
<P>At this time then, when there exi&s;ts a &s;ummer-flow of &s;ap-juice,
this pernicious in&s;ect in uncounted millions pierces the
&s;ap-ve&s;&s;els round the new &s;hoots, or the pulmonary arteries be|neath
the leaves; and thus drinks the vegetable chyle, or &s;ap-juice,
with &s;uch avidity, as to part with much of it again almo&s;t
unchanged. This I now believe with Sauvage to be the origin
of one kind of honey-dew certainly; and if another kind of
honey-dew exi&s;ts, as he mentions, where there are no aphi&s;es,
I &s;u&s;pect, as observed in No. 1. 7. of this Section, that it mu&s;t
ari&s;e from the inverted action of the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els of the
<PB N="317" REF="323">
leaf, at the time of the increa&s;ed quantity of &s;ap-juice about
Mid&s;ummer; but have not had an opportunity to a&s;certain the&s;e
facts.</P>
<P>Thirdly, There appears to be a power impre&s;&s;ed on organized
bodies by the great author of all things, by which they not only
increa&s;e in size and &s;trength from their embryon &s;tate to their
maturity, and occa&s;ionally cure their accidental di&s;ea&s;es, and
repair their accidental injuries, but al&s;o a power of produc|ing
armour to prevent tho&s;e more violent injuries, which
would otherwi&s;e de&s;troy them. Of this la&s;t kind are the poi|&s;onous
juices of &s;ome plants, as of atropa belladonna, deadly
night&s;hade, hyo&s;cyamus, hen-bane, cynoglo&s;&s;um, hounds-tongue.
Other plants are armed with thorns and prickles to prevent the
depredation of animals, as ilex, holly, crataegus, hawthorn,
ribes gro&s;&s;ularia, goo&s;eberry; the leaves of which would be
perpetually devoured but for this kind of protection. Other
plants &s;ecrete a vi&s;cid juice to agglutinate the in&s;ects, which
crawl up towards their fructification, as &s;ilene, catchfly, dro&s;era,
&s;un-dew; and others by the contraction of their leaves or petals
arre&s;t or de&s;troy the in&s;ects, which attack them, as dionoea
mu&s;cipula, and apocynum andro&s;emifolium.</P>
<P>But how can vegetables protect the whole inferior &s;urfaces of
their leaves, and of their young ri&s;ing &s;tems from the innumera|ble
progeny of the de&s;tructive aphis, which penetrates their
chyle ve&s;&s;els and their arteries; and which from their immen&s;e
numbers may in proce&s;s of time de&s;troy the vegetable world.
Many vegetables have not yet acquired any means of defence,
and have therefore the fir&s;t growth of their foliage much injured,
or totally de&s;troyed by this de&s;tructive in&s;ect, as the nectarine, and
peach, and plum, and cherry-trees, in many parts of this coun|try,
as is every year &s;een and lamented.</P>
<P>Some vegetables have neverthele&s;s already acquired an ar|mour,
which le&s;&s;ens, though it does not totally prevent, the in|juries
of this animal. This is mo&s;t con&s;picuous on the &s;tems
and floral-leaves of mo&s;s-ro&s;es, and on the young &s;hoots and
leaf-&s;talks of nut-trees. Both the&s;e are covered with thick&s;et
bri&s;tles, which terminate in globular-heads, and not only pre|vent
the aphis from &s;urrounding them in &s;uch great numbers,
<PB N="318" REF="324">
and from piercing their ve&s;&s;els &s;o ea&s;ily, but al&s;o &s;ecrete from the
gland, with which I &s;u&s;pect them to be terminated, a juice;
which is inconvenient, or deleterious to the in&s;ect which touches
it.</P>
<P>Hence mo&s;s-ro&s;es appear to be le&s;s injured by the aphis, than
other ro&s;es, which have le&s;s of this armour; and while on
plum-trees, and on many herbaceous plants, they hang round the
upright young &s;hoots with their heads downwards, and in&s;ert
their trunks, &s;o as totally to conceal the ri&s;ing &s;hoot; yet on
nut-trees, though they are &s;een in millions beneath the leaves on
the unarmed parts, they never appear round the young &s;hoots,
nor on the large trunks of the ve&s;&s;els beneath the leaves, all
which have acquired a panoply of bri&s;tles with glandular heads
to them, like tho&s;e round the mo&s;s-ro&s;e, but without the
branching &s;tructure of the latter. While tho&s;e plants, which
are not infe&s;ted with the legions of this &s;elf-productive animal,
have probably acquired &s;ome material mixed with their &s;ap-juice,
or blood, which is poi&s;onous to them; as tho&s;e plants,
which po&s;&s;e&s;s a milky or yellow blood, as the &s;purges euphorbia,
or the celandines chelidonium, or the fig-tree, ficus.</P>
<P>Nor is this more a&s;toni&s;hing, than that the holly-trees &s;hould
annually &s;upply prickles only to their lower leaves, about &s;ix or
eight feet from the ground, as high as the animals can reach
them, which would prey upon them; but refu&s;e the expence of
putting forth prickles in their higher branches, which are &s;aved
by their &s;ituation, as I have repeatedly ob&s;erved on the nume|rous
holly-trees, which are the ornament of Needwood fore&s;t.</P>
<P>From hence I &s;u&s;pect, that another rea&s;on, why the leaves of
nut-trees and of ro&s;e-trees are not curled up or bli&s;tered like
tho&s;e of nectarines, peaches, plums, and cherries, is becau&s;e
their foot-&s;talks, and the larger branches of the pulmonary ar|teries,
are defended by the&s;e bri&s;tles, which are perhaps only
beginning to appear on the leaf-&s;talks of the plum, but which
may increa&s;e in the progre&s;&s;ion of time; as all the works of
nature may be approaching to greater perfection, as mentioned
more at large in No. 2 of the la&s;t Section of this work.</P>
<P>Fourthly. The means of de&s;troying an in&s;ect &s;o exten&s;ively
injurious not only to gardens and hot-hou&s;es, but to half the
<PB N="319" REF="325">
vegetable world, would be indeed a valuable di&s;covery. If the
eggs exi&s;t on the young buds, as Dr. Richard&s;on affirms, &s;ome
application to the&s;e, before they are hatched, which might di&s;|&s;olve
their &s;hells, as by very dilute marine acid injected on them;
or by &s;ome adhe&s;ive material, which might invi&s;cate them as
&s;oon as they are hatched, whether they appear fir&s;t in their larva
&s;tate, like minute caterpillars, or in the form of the parent
aphis, as &s;oap-&s;uds injected on the twigs before the leaves begin
to unfold; or perhaps by rubbing them with oil or glue by
means of a &s;ponge, or a painter's bru&s;h; but experiments alone
can determine the effect of the&s;e applications, both on the in&s;ect
and on the tree.</P>
<P>Lime water alone will not readily de&s;troy the aphis, as I ob|&s;erved
by immer&s;ing leaves with aphi&s;es on them; which crept
up the leaves, and thus e&s;caped. But if pot-a&s;h, or fixed al|kali,
be mixed with lime, the &s;olution becomes &s;o cau&s;tic as to
de&s;troy many in&s;ects without injuring the foliage of trees, or the
&s;tems of wheat, if we may credit M. Socoloff, who in the
tran&s;actions of an Academy at Peter&s;burgh, Vol. V. a&s;&s;erts,
that he added three parts of quick-lime newly made to two parts
of a &s;aturated &s;olution of fixed alkali in water; which poured
on the ground de&s;troyed the earth-worms, and &s;prinkled on the
leaves of trees de&s;troyed the caterpillars, but did not injure, or
much injure thee foliage of trees, or the leaves of wheat plants.</P>
<P>Tar water has lately been &s;aid to de&s;troy &s;lugs, white &s;nails
without &s;hells, and might be worthy a trial by injecting it on
trees at fir&s;t with caution, le&s;t it &s;hould injure them; as it is
probably the vegetable acid chiefly, with a &s;mall portion of
e&s;&s;ential oil, which is di&s;olved, or mixed with the water, by
agitation. See No 3. 5. of this Section.</P>
<P>Previous to the pullulation of the buds, it is al&s;o believed to
be of great &s;ervice to water wall-trees with lime-water, or with
&s;oap-&s;uds, or perhaps with the addition of &s;ome pot-a&s;h to either
of them to make a more cau&s;tic ley, &s;uch as is recommended
for &s;teeping &s;eed-wheat; but this with caution, as I have known
a &s;olution of hepar &s;ulphuris kill the branches of a tree, which
were moi&s;tened with it, as well as the in&s;ects, which were upon
<PB N="320" REF="326">
it. Nor am I certain that this will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e from the
ob&s;ervations I have heard from tho&s;e, who have tried it.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ential oils are all deleterious to certain in&s;ects, and
hence their u&s;e in the vegetable economy, being produced in
flowers or leaves to protect them from the depredations of their
voracious enemies. One of the e&s;&s;ential oils, that of turpen|tine,
is recommended by M. de Tho&s;&s;e for the purpo&s;e of de|&s;troying
in&s;ects, which infect both vegetables and animals.
Having ob&s;erved that the trees were attacked by multitudes of
&s;mall in&s;ects of different colours (pucins ou pucerons), which
injured their young branches, he de&s;troyed them all entirely in
the following manner. He put into a bowl a few handfuls of
earth, on which he poured a &s;mall quantity of oil of turpentine;
he then beat the whole together with a &s;patula, pouring on it
water, till it became of the con&s;i&s;tence of &s;oup; with this mix|ture
he moi&s;tened the ends of the branches, and both the in&s;ects
and their eggs were de&s;troyed, and other in&s;ects kept aloof by
the &s;cent of the turpentine. He adds, that he de&s;troyed the
fleas of his puppies by once bathing them in warm water im|pregnated
with oil of turpentine. Mem. d' Agriculture, An.
1787, Printemp. p. 109.</P>
<P>I &s;prinkled &s;ome oil of turpentine by means of a bru&s;h on
&s;ome branches of a nectarine-tree, which was covered with the
aphis; but it killed both the in&s;ect and the branches. A &s;olu|tion
of ar&s;enic much diluted did the &s;ame. Might not the &s;cent
of turpentine, or of tar, &s;meared on a fruit-wall deter the flies
from approaching the trees to depo&s;it their eggs? or might not
ar&s;enic mixed with honey be &s;meared on the wall, to which the
trees are nailed, be likely to attract the aphis as well as other
kinds of flying in&s;ects. But none of the&s;e &s;hould be &s;meared on
the branches, le&s;t it injure or de&s;troy the tree. Perhaps if a
few twigs &s;meared with turpentine, mixed with a little oil of
turpentine to make it more fluid, and to increa&s;e its odour,
were fixed in quince-trees, or in apple-trees, the flowers of
which are liable to be de&s;troyed by the eggs depo&s;ited in them
by a &s;mall fly; they might be deterred from approaching the
tree, as the great u&s;e of e&s;&s;ential oils, which cau&s;e the fra|grance
<PB N="321" REF="327">
of flowers, &s;eems to be to deter in&s;ects from infe&s;ting
their leaves, or preying upon their honey.</P>
<P>It is probable, that if infu&s;ions were made in hot water, or
perhaps for a longer time in cold water, of tho&s;e leaves which
no in&s;ects devour; as of the walnut, juglans; lauro-cera&s;us,
laurel; foxglove, digitalis; hen-bane, hyo&s;cyamus; hounds-tongue,
cynoglo&s;&s;um; rag-wort, &s;enecio jacobaea; or of tobac|co,
nicotiana; and many others; and were &s;prinkled on the
curled leaves of wall-trees, or on the buds before they open, by
a pump, or by a bru&s;h, or &s;ponge; they might de&s;troy the in|&s;ects
without injuring the trees, which might be determined by a
few experiments.</P>
<P>The du&s;t of tobacco is frequently &s;pread on affected leaves,
but not I believe with very encouraging &s;ucce&s;s, owing perhaps
to the powder not being very fine, or not &s;oon enough applied.
Some kinds of lime &s;trewed on in powder might probably be
too cau&s;tic, and de&s;troy the leaf along with the in&s;ects; which
al&s;o might be &s;ubjected to experiment. The powder of &s;ulphur,
or of tobacco, or of any of the poi&s;onous leaves above men|tioned,
might be injected upon affected trees by a powder-puff,
&s;uch as hair-dre&s;&s;ers u&s;e, or the &s;moke of tobacco, or of any
other of the poi&s;onous leaves above mentioned, might be forci|bly
blown on them by an adapted pair of bellows, as the &s;moke
of many of them may po&s;&s;e&s;s as poi&s;onous a quality as that of
tobacco; and even the &s;team of a decoction of others, as of
lauro-cera&s;us, and walnut; the poi&s;on of the former of which
is known to ri&s;e in di&s;tillation, might probably be u&s;ed with ef|fect;
but this mu&s;t depend on the greater or le&s;s fixity of their
e&s;&s;ential oils. The &s;moke or &s;team might be applied to wall-trees
by previou&s;ly &s;u&s;pending over them a large &s;heet of mat|ting,
or of linen, or of paper, or an old carpet; but may how|ever
be u&s;ed with greater advantage in hot-hou&s;es, than in the
open air.</P>
<P>Since the above was written I directed in the early &s;pring of
this year one nectarine-tree to be moi&s;tened with tar-water, and
parts of the wall to be &s;meared with tar; another to be moi&s;ten|ed
with lime and pot-a&s;h di&s;&s;olved in water; a third with &s;oap-&s;uds
and lime added to them; and many both nectarine and
<PB N="322" REF="328">
peach-trees with &s;oap-&s;uds alone. This was done by means of
a bru&s;h before any flowers appeared, and was repeated thrice
on different days; but to my great di&s;appointment, when the
leaves appeared, they became affected with the aphis as on
former years. I al&s;o afterwards dipped many nut-leaves crowd|ed
with the aphis in &s;trong infu&s;ion of tobacco, for a few mi|nutes,
as the leaves hung on the trees without, as I believed,
de&s;troying the in&s;ects; though &s;ome of them appeared for a
time to be rendered torpid.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s on covering a low nut-tree with &s;ome &s;heets of
brown paper &s;ewed together, and throwing the &s;moke of to|bacco
under it from a proper pair of bellows, great numbers of
aphi&s;es were killed, many of which dropped from the upper
leaves on tho&s;e below them, and many adhered motionle&s;s to
the under &s;urfaces of the leaves. The fine powder of tobacco
called Scotch &s;nuff &s;prinkled on the aphi&s;es by turning up &s;ome
of the leaves quickly de&s;troyed them.</P>
<P>As walnut-leaves may be had in great quantity in the autumn,
and the whole plant of &s;enecio jacobaea, rag-wort, at any time,
both which are probably deleterious to in&s;ects, as they &s;eem ne|ver
to be injured by them, the&s;e might be procured at &s;mall
expence, and might probably, when dried and burnt, produce a
&s;moke equally de&s;tructive to them.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The mo&s;t ingenious manner of de&s;troying the aphis
would be effected by the propagation of its greate&s;t enemy, the
larva of the aphidivorous fly; of which I have given a print,
and which is &s;aid by Reaumeur, Tom. III. Mem. 9. to depo&s;it
its eggs, where the aphis abounds; and that, as &s;oon as the
larvae are produced, they devour hundreds around them with
the nece&s;&s;ity of no other movements but by turning to the right
or left, arre&s;ting the aphis and &s;ucking its juices. If the&s;e eggs
could be collected and carefully pre&s;erved during the winter, and
properly di&s;po&s;ed on nectarine and peach-trees in the early
&s;pring, or protected from injury in hot-hou&s;es; it is probable,
that this plague of the aphis might be counteracted by the na|tural
means of devouring one in&s;ect by another; as the &s;erpent
of Mo&s;es devoured tho&s;e of the magicians.</P>
<P>Mr. Horrocks of Derby &s;hewed me this larva of the aphidi|vorous
<PB N="323" REF="329">
fly, which I &s;aw devour two or three aphi&s;es, and Mr.
Swanwick of this town at my reque&s;t made an accurate draw|ing
both of the larva and fly, which he kindly favoured me
with, accompanied with the following note.</P>
<P>&startq;On Augu&s;t the 4th Mr. Horrocks obligingly &s;ent me an
aphidivorous larva in a box on a leaf of a plum-tree, on which
were a number of aphi&s;es; and I had almo&s;t immediately the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it eat one.</P>
<P>&startq;The method of taking his prey is thus: he is like the &s;loth
in his di&s;po&s;ition, for he does not ramble about, while he has
food around him. He only lifts up his head, and &s;trikes it
down again, extending it in various directions, as if he was
blind, and repeating the above action. If by &s;o doing he hap|pens
to feel an aphis, he immediately &s;eizes it by the back, lifts
it up and poi&s;es it in the air, as if to prevent it from liberating
itself by its &s;truggles again&s;t the &s;urface of the leaf, or that it
may fall more ea&s;ily into the cavity of his mouth. In this po&s;i|tion
he holds it, while he pierces it, and &s;ucks the juice out of
the body; which having done, he drops the &s;kin, licks his lips
round with his little black tongue, contracts his head, and
drops it down; thus re&s;ting in perfect repo&s;e for &s;ome time,
after which he repeats the &s;ame actions. But if he is in the
mid&s;t: of plenty, he &s;eldom gives him&s;elf this trouble, but waits
till an aphis touches him, when he immediately turns his head
round, and with fatal certainty &s;eizes him, poizing him as be|fore.</P>
<P>&startq;For the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing what fly was produced from this
caterpillar, I procured him food for about ten days. During
this time he eat a great number of aphi&s;es, and grew to about an
inch in length; when he left off eating, contracted him&s;elf to
about half his former length, fixed him&s;elf to the box by a
little gluten, which he di&s;charged from his mouth, and without
ca&s;ting a &s;kin changed to a chry&s;alis.</P>
<P>&startq;In this &s;tate he lay about ten or eleven days, at the end of
which time he bur&s;t his cell, and came out a beautiful fly, of
which the figure is a good repre&s;entation.&endq;</P>
<P>No. 1. The caterpillar with an aphis in his mouth.</P>
<P>No. 2. The chry&s;alis open at one end.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="330">
No. 3. The fly.</P>
<P>Another enemy to the aphis is &s;aid to be a beautiful &s;mall
&s;potted beetle, called a lady-bird by the people. Several of
the&s;e were &s;een on the nut-leaves, and are believed fir&s;t to ap|pear
there in their larva &s;tate, and to feed on the aphis; they
then change to a chry&s;alis, and la&s;tly to a &s;mall wing-&s;heathed
beetle; and finally, I &s;uppo&s;e, they bore holes into the earth,
as would appear from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;heaths to their wings, and
that they there depo&s;it their eggs to be hatched, and to climb
the trees infe&s;ted with the aphis in the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>Thus from the exertions of a few aphidivorous larvae or ca|terpillars,
from the poi&s;onous juices of &s;ome plants, and from
the bri&s;tly armour on the young twigs and leaves of others, the
vegetable world is &s;o far protected from the de&s;truction with
which it has been, and is threatened, by the fine probo&s;cis of
this multitudinous in&s;ect, which in its manner of attack re&s;em|bles
that of the large bat of A&s;ia, ve&s;pertilio-vampyris; which
is a&s;&s;erted by Linneus to drink the blood by night of &s;ervants,
who &s;leep in the open air, Sy&s;t. Natur. p. 46; and is &s;aid by
others to be &s;o &s;kilful an operator as not to wake the patient by
the puncture, which it inflicts, as it agreeably fans them with
its wings.</P>
<P>3. Many of the orchards of apple-trees in this country are
liable to lo&s;e all their leaves by the depredations of caterpillars;
the &s;ame occurs to goo&s;eberry-trees in &s;ome gardens, and to
cabbages in the latter part of the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>A few years ago I ob&s;erved, that the blo&s;&s;oms of the quince-tree,
before they were quite expended, were perforated by a
fly; as the wound could be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned like that on young
nuts, when wounded by the curculio; and all the blo&s;&s;oms of a
large tree were thus de&s;troyed by a &s;mall caterpillar. And in
this late &s;ummer of 1799 the apple-blo&s;&s;oms in this country are
much injured by a caterpillar, which ecats the &s;eed in the peri|carp
of each blo&s;&s;om either before or at the time of its im|pregnation,
the petals of the flower clo&s;ing again over it and
dying.</P>
<P>The leaves of many trees are renewed after having been to|tally
de&s;troyed in the early part of the &s;ea&s;on; as tho&s;e of the
<PB N="325" REF="331">
apple-tree above mentioned, which had lo&s;t its leaves entirely
by lightning; as the mulberry-trees in Italy, which are thus
robbed of their fir&s;t leaves to feed &s;ilk-worms, as the tea-tree
in China, which is thus robbed for a fa&s;hionable potation.
And la&s;tly, as the euonymus, or &s;pindle-tree, which in this
country has its fir&s;t crop of leaves almo&s;t perpetually de&s;troyed
by caterpillars. But though the leaves are re&s;tored after the
depredation of this in&s;ect, yet there follows an irremediable
injury to the fruit. See Sect. IX. 2. 6.</P>
<P>As the eggs of butterflies are in the autumn wi&s;ely depo&s;ited
in &s;ituations, where the young can find proper food, when they
are hatched by the warmth of the &s;pring; tho&s;e on apple-trees,
and on goo&s;eberry-trees, are frequently depo&s;ited on the leaves,
as well as on other parts of the tree; and as the&s;e leaves fall on
the ground, the eggs are thus covered and protected from the
fro&s;ts, and the young caterpillars are believed to climb the trees
in &s;earch of their food. If this be true, it would be an ad|vantageous
practice to rake together the leaves in orchards, and
to burn them; which &s;ome have done from an idea, that the
&s;moke thus produced was noxious to the eggs of in&s;ects depo|&s;ited
on the branches.</P>
<P>Some gardeners for this purpo&s;e rear their goo&s;eberry-trees on
one &s;tem only; and believe, that by tying a fringe round this
&s;tem the in&s;ects, which are hatched in the &s;oil, if &s;uch there be,
can not climb up the tree thus &s;urrounded with a fringe; and as
tho&s;e caterpillars, which are already on the tree, let them&s;elves
down by a thread, when the tree is &s;haken, from the fear of
being hurt by the vibrating twigs; if this thread be then broken,
by moving a &s;tick round under the tree, the&s;e in&s;ects cannot re|a&s;cend.
A paper recently tarred on the out&s;ide might be
wrapped round the &s;tem of the tree in&s;tead of the fringe with
perhaps more certain &s;ucce&s;s; but the tar &s;hould not be &s;meared
on the bark of the tree, left it &s;hould injure or de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved in the choice of apple-trees, that tho&s;e
kinds, which flower early, are le&s;s liable to the depredation of
in&s;ects; and tho&s;e, which flower late, are le&s;s liable to the in|juries
of fro&s;t. In apple-trees perhaps the former is in &s;ome
&s;ituation the greater evil, but in pears I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect the latter,

<P>The white butterflies, which depo&s;it their eggs on cabbage
plants, are &s;een flying about awkwardly in &s;ummer, and &s;hould
be caught, and de&s;troyed by the gardener. Or they perhaps
might be invited and poi&s;oned by a mixture of honey, and wa|ter,
and ar&s;enic; as a wealthy man in Italy was &s;aid to have
poi&s;oned his neighbour's bees. See Sect. VI. 6. 3. The&s;e
cabbage-caterpillars would increa&s;e in de&s;tructive numbers, but
are half of them annually de&s;troyed by a &s;mall ichneumon fly;
which depo&s;its its own eggs in their backs, which are there
hatched by the warmth of the animal, and live on the &s;ilk
there &s;ecreted for its future ne&s;t; and eroding their way out
&s;pin &s;mall cacoons of their own; ten or twelve of which hang
on each caterpillar; which thus peri&s;hes in&s;tead of changing
into a butterfly. This I &s;aw happen to a great many of them,
which were put into a box on bran with a few cabbage leaves,
and covered with gauze, a few days before they were ready to
change into chry&s;oli&s;ts. This ichneumon fly &s;hould therefore
be encouraged, if his winter habitation could be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>4. The variety of in&s;ects, which infe&s;t hot-hou&s;es, as the
aca$us, thrips, aphis, and cocci, and the means commonly u&s;ed
to de&s;troy them by the &s;moke of tobacco, or by the powder of
&s;ulphur and tobacco, or by &s;olutions of lime and &s;ulphur, are
de&s;cribed in Speechly's books on the Vine and Pine; but re|quire
&s;ome caution in their application. A friend of mine, by
&s;ubjecting a wall-tree to the &s;moke of &s;ulphur by hanging a matt
before it during the fumigation, killed both the in&s;ects and the
tree.</P>
<P>5. Other kinds of in&s;ects are produced beneath the &s;oil, or
occa&s;ionally retire into terre&s;trial habitations. Of the&s;e are the
various families of &s;nails, with and without &s;hells, and other
in&s;ects with &s;heaths over their wings, with which they are fur|ni&s;hed
to prevent any injury from the friction of the &s;ides of the
holes they make or de&s;cend into.</P>
<P>It has been lately &s;uppo&s;ed, that the great de&s;truction of the
crops of turnips, which occa&s;ionally occurs, is owing to the de|predation
of a white &s;lug, or &s;nail, which comes out of the &s;oil
<PB N="327" REF="333">
before &s;un-ri&s;e in dewy mornings; and that by rolling the young
turnips with a heavy roller before &s;un-ri&s;e for a few mornings,
the&s;e pernicious in&s;ects may be de&s;troyed, and add manure to
the ri&s;ing plants they have injured.</P>
<P>The white &s;lugs in gardens are very de&s;tructive to many
flower-&s;tems, as they ri&s;e out of the ground, as to dictamnus
fraxinella, apocynum andro&s;emifolium, to pha&s;eolus, kidney|bean,
to cinara, artic$oke, and many other plants. I well re|member
in one &s;ea&s;on favourable to their production in a garden
by the &s;ide of the Derwent ob&s;erving, that many artichoke
&s;tems above a foot high were eaten by them near the moi&s;t earth
till they fell down, like trees felled by the ax. It has lately
been a&s;&s;erted, that watering the ground with tar-water will de|&s;troy
them; which may be made by adding a few pounds of
tar to a hog&s;head of water, and well &s;tirring it, without per|ceptible
injury to the tar. A circle of lime round the flower-&s;tems,
or of &s;alt, or even of bran in dry weather, are means of
preventing the approach of &s;lugs; and &s;ome gardeners lay a
board lightly on the ground between the alleys, under which
the &s;lugs hide them&s;elves when the &s;un ri&s;es, and are hence
ea&s;ily caught and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The leaves of the young turnip are al&s;o believed to be de|&s;troyed
by a fly; which, if it be of the &s;carabaeus, or beetle
kind, which ari&s;es out of the earth, may likewi&s;e be de&s;troyed
by rolling. The Chine&s;e are &s;aid by Sir G. Staunton to &s;teep
all their &s;eeds in liquid manure until they &s;well, and their ger|mination
begins to appear; which they believe not only ha&s;tens
he growth of the plants, but al&s;o defends them again&s;t in&s;ects
beneath the &s;oil; and that to this Sir George ob&s;erves it may
be owing, that the Chine&s;e turnips e&s;cape the fly &s;o injurious to
them in this country. Emba&s;&s;y to China, 8vo. edit. Vol. III.
p. 310. An ob&s;ervation of Mr. Guillet in the Bath Agricul|ture,
Vol. II. Art. 44, &s;eems to confirm this idea. He a&s;&s;erts,
that when turnip &s;eed is &s;own during rain, or has rain immedi|ately
afterwards, that the fir&s;t leaves are &s;o vigorous that the fly$
never attacks them; or that the rain it&s;elf is &s;o inconvenient to
the fly, as to prevent its appearance. It is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted by Mr.
Exeter in the Tran&s;actions of the London Society for Arts,
<PB N="328" REF="334">
Vol. XVI. p. 191, that the &s;owing turnips in drills deeper than
by broad ca&s;t, accelerates the growth of the plant by giving it
more moi&s;ture; whence it &s;ooner puts forth its rough leaves,
and e&s;capes the depredations of the fly. He &s;peaks highly of
the u&s;e of the drill, advi&s;es the rows to be one foot di&s;tant,
u&s;es three quarters of a pound of &s;eed to an acre, and &s;$ws
them from one inch and a half to two inches deep.</P>
<P>6. The great numbers and varieties of animated beings&punc;
which live under the &s;oil, and &s;leep in winter, de&s;cending be|neath
the reach of fro&s;t, is truly a&s;toni&s;hing. I once ob&s;erved
&s;uch immen&s;e numbers of &s;mall wing-&s;heathed in&s;ects, which I
believed to be the &s;carabaeus &s;ol&s;titialis, or fern-chaffer, as they
were not one-&s;ixth part of the &s;ize of a May-chaffer, &s;carabaeus
melolontha, though much of the &s;ame form and colour; which
aro&s;e out of the ground near the cold bath at Lichfield, that I
gue&s;&s;ed, that one or two emerged from every &s;quare inch of
many acres of land.</P>
<P>The grubs or maggots, from which the&s;e wing-&s;heathed flies
aro&s;e, I &s;u&s;pect in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons and &s;ituations favourable to
their production to be very de&s;tructive to the wheat in &s;pring, or
the early part to &s;ummer, devouring the &s;tem near the &s;urface
of the ground at the joint, which is &s;weet, till it falls down or
withers, by which many crops were nearly de&s;troyed this year,
1797, and that, I was informed, on &s;ome lands, which had
been previou&s;ly well limed.</P>
<P>Mr. Tull in his hu&s;bandry, &s;peaking of wheat, advi&s;es not to
&s;ow it deeper than an inch, &s;ince the thread or caudex which
connects the lower or &s;eminal root with the upper or coronal
root, he believes to be then not &s;o readily found by worms in
the winter, as one three inches long might be, both on account
of the greater length of the latter, and becau&s;e in&s;ects do not
ri&s;e &s;o near the &s;urface in the winter months.</P>
<P>Where this pe&s;tilential grub occurs, perhaps rolling the land
early in the mornings in the &s;pring might cru&s;h them. And
when the fly is &s;een to come out in &s;uch abundance in the &s;um|mer
evenings on gra&s;s land or fallows, it is probable, that rol|ling
the ground in the evening might prevent the return into
the earth both of the&s;e and of the May-chaffers to deposit their
<PB N="329" REF="335">
eggs, and thus prevent their future progeny; or during their
grub &s;tate, when they exi&s;t at the roots of wheat above or ju&s;t
beneath the &s;urface of the &s;oil, perhaps &s;laked lime might be
&s;prinkled over the crop in powder, or &s;ea-&s;alt in powder, which
might be wa&s;hed down the &s;tems of the corn in a wet day, and
de&s;troy the in&s;ect without injuring the vegetable; or la&s;tly, by
tar-water; all which might be fir&s;t tried on a &s;mall part of a
field; for as lime is not all of equal purity, it is not all of the
&s;ame &s;trength or cau&s;ticity.</P>
<P>Another in&s;ect is &s;aid to injure wheat when in flower, and is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be the thrips phy&s;apus of Linneus, as mentioned in
the Tran&s;actions of the Linnean Society, Vol. III. But as it
only attacks the late flowering &s;tems, it may po&s;&s;ibly be prevent|ed
by &s;owing the wheat early, if it &s;hould ever become a &s;erious
evil.</P>
<P>Some time ago an in&s;ect called a corn-butterfly committed
great ravages in France while in its vermicular &s;tate, &s;o as to
ruin two hundred pari&s;hes. A cure for it was at length di&s;co|vered,
which con&s;i&s;ted in drying the wheat in an oven before
&s;owing it, and thus expo&s;ing it to &s;uch a degree of heat as
would de&s;troy the eggs of the in&s;ect without injuring the &s;eed;
or perhaps which hatched them without &s;ufficient moi&s;ture to
&s;often the grain for their &s;upport. See Encycl. Britan.
Agricult.</P>
<P>Between Che&s;terfield and Plai&s;ly in Derby&s;hire I well remem|ber
above forty years ago to have &s;een for two or three miles
together every leaf of the hedges devoured by the May-chaffers,
&s;carabaeus melolontha, which hung on each other, where the
foliage was de&s;troyed, like bees in a &s;warm. And to have
found in the &s;ame year, as it lay dead in a field near Che&s;ter|field,
a true locu&s;t, like a very large gra&s;s-hopper with very
long and broad wings; which I pre&s;erved in &s;pirits, and was
informed that many of them were found in other parts of Eng|land
about the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>All the&s;e noxious animals might be de&s;troyed or dimini&s;hed
by encouraging the breed of &s;mall hedge-birds, and perhaps of
larks, and of rooks, by not taking their ne&s;ts. I have ob&s;erv|ed,
that hou&s;e &s;parrows de&s;troy the May-chaffer, eating out the
<PB N="330" REF="336">
central part of it; and am told that turkeys and rooks do the
&s;ame; which I thence conclude might be as grateful food, if
properly cooked, as the locu&s;ts or termites of the ea&s;t. And
probably the large grub, or larva of it, which the rooks pick
up in following the plow, is as delicious as the grub called
groogroo, and a large caterpillar, which feeds on the palm;
both of which are roa&s;ted and eaten in the We&s;t Indies. The
various &s;pecies of linnets carry &s;mall caterpillars to their gaping
young; and hedgehogs are &s;aid to devour &s;nails, and on that
account to be profitably kept in gardens.</P>
<P>When a &s;evere fro&s;t occurs, before the ground is covered
with &s;now, tho&s;e in&s;ects, which do not penetrate deeply into
the earth during their hybernation, as the &s;hell-le&s;s &s;nails or
&s;lugs, are liable to be de&s;troyed, and probably many of the
larvae of the fern-chaffer and May-chaffer, as is &s;een by their
dimini&s;hed numbers in the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In China the aurelia of the &s;ilk-worm, after the &s;ilk is wound
off, and the white earth-grub, and the larva of the &s;phinx moth,
furni&s;h articles at the table, and are &s;aid to be delicious. Em|ba&s;&s;y
to China. Neverthele&s;s all the caterpillar tribes may not
be equally innocuous; as in this climate the hairy caterpillars, if
laid between the fingers, where the &s;kin is tender, I have ob|&s;erved
to produce an itching and leave &s;ome of their pointed
bri&s;tles in the &s;kin. And Mr. Vaillant, in his travels in Africa
from the Cape, a&s;&s;erts, that both a black and a white hairy ca|terpillar
becomes &s;o poi&s;onous, when it feeds on a large eup|horbia,
that the natives put them in bags, brui&s;e them, and after
a few days poi&s;on their arrows with them. But that they are
le&s;s poi&s;onous if they feed on le&s;s acrid vegetables.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be great difficulty in de&s;troying the larvae, or
grubs, or caterpillars, of many in&s;ects, which are injurious to
the fruits and kernels, as well as to the foliage of plants, by
any chemical mixtures; as in this &s;tate, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome of
them are uncommonly hardy or tenacious of life. Mr. Gouch
affirms, that he kept the curculio nucum, or worm found in nuts, in
brandy for &s;eventeen hours, which recovered; and I
remember putting a worm, which came from a per&s;on, who
called it an a&s;caris, though it was above an inch long, and
<PB N="331" REF="337">
nearly as thick as a thin crow-quill, into a &s;aturated &s;olution of
&s;ugar of lead in water; which lived many hours without appa|rent
injury. See Nicholson's Journal, No. 21, for November
179$.</P>
<P>7. A great number of bees, as well as of moths, and butter|flies,
mu&s;t be very injurious to flowers, and con&s;equently to the
pr$duction of fruits, as all of them plunder the nectaries of their
honey, and thence deprive the anthers and &s;tigmas of their
adapted nouri&s;hment, as mentioned in Sect. VI. 6. 3. This
would be more de&s;tructive to the &s;eminal products of plants,
but many of them po&s;&s;e&s;s means of defending their re&s;ervoirs
of honey, and yet of expo&s;ing it to the influence of the air,
&s;ome of them by long winding canals, as in the bottom of the
tubes of the honey-&s;uckles, trefoils, and lark-&s;purs, lonicera,
trifolium, delphinium; others by covering it with a hood, as
in monk&s;hood, aconitum; others by a gluten, as in catchfly,
&s;ilene, and in fun-dew, dro&s;era; others by contracting &s;ome part
of their leaves or flowers, and de&s;troying the ho&s;tile in&s;ect, as
in dionoea mu&s;cipula, and in apocynum andro&s;emifolium; and
finally, many other flowers have probably acquired the habit of
&s;ecreting more honey than is nece&s;&s;ary for their own con&s;ump|tion,
as cacalia &s;uaveolens, alpine colts-foot, and polygonum
fagopyrum, buck-wheat. From all the&s;e contrivances the flowers
of plants probably receive le&s;s injury from the depredations of
bees, moths and butterflies, in this country, and from the hum|ming
bird in tropical climates, than they otherwi&s;e would be
&s;ubject to.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the lo&s;s of much of their honey an abundance of
bees mu&s;t likewi&s;e injure the &s;eminal products of vegetables by
plundering the &s;tamina of flowers of their anther-du&s;t for bee-bread,
as Mr. Hunter believes; and al&s;o of the wax which co|vers
the anthers for their defence again&s;t rain. Neverthele&s;s, as
mankind convert to their own purpo&s;es the honey thus collected
by bees, and the wax, with which they fabricate their combs;
and as the &s;eeds of plants and their fruits are neverthele&s;s in
&s;ufficient abundance; the depredations of bees are not counteract|ed
like tho&s;e of other in&s;ects, but on the contrary encouraged.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="338">
The following ob&s;ervations, which I made this &s;ummer, may
be of &s;ervice to tho&s;e who keep bees, and which I &s;hall therefore
here relate. The bees of one &s;ociety frequently attack tho&s;e of
another &s;ociety, plunder them of their honey, and de&s;troy mo&s;t
of them, perhaps all of them, in battle; in this re&s;pect re&s;emb|ing
the &s;ocieties of mankind! This war for plunder occurs more
frequently than is commonly &s;u&s;pected. Last year I had one
hive of bees totally de&s;troyed, and the year before another,
which I did not take means to prevent, though I &s;aw the con|te&s;t,
and the number de&s;troyed in the latter; but not early
enough in the commencement of ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>Last week, June 16, I happened to &s;ee a great number of
bees on the wing near the mouth of my only hive, and &s;uppo&s;ed
that they were about to &s;warm. In an hour or two, on again
attending to them, I di&s;tinctly &s;aw it was a violent battle; and
at night ob&s;erved about a hundred dead bees on the ground,
and on the bench before the hive. I then directed a board
about an inch thick to be laid on the bee-bench, and &s;et the hive
on this board with its mouth exactly on the edge of this board,
the mouth of the hive was al&s;o contracted to about an inch in
length, and a &s;emicircular hollow was made in the board imme|diately
under the mouth of the hive. By this means the a&s;&s;ail|ing
bees were obliged to alight on the bee-bench, and then to
climb perpendicularly up the edge of the board, on which the
hive was now placed; and thus appeared to act with great di&s;|advantage;
and a much le&s;s number of bees appeared to be
&s;lain in this day's battle; whence it would be advantageous
always to place bee-hives in this manner.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, as the war did not cea&s;e, I directed early on
the next morning to remove the bee hive to a di&s;tant part of the
garden, and to a more ea&s;terly a&s;pect, and found to my great
&s;atisfaction, that the ho&s;ts of the enemy did not follow; and
that in a few hours the una&s;&s;ailed bees re&s;umed their work, as
appeared by their going into the hive with loaded thighs; and
though a few of them were &s;een on the following two nights
re&s;ting on their old habitation, the&s;e were carried early on the
en&s;uing morning in their torpid &s;tate to their new &s;ituation, and
the war ended without extermination of either &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>IV. DESTRUCTION BY VERMIN.</HEAD>
<P>1. The de&s;truction of grain, after it is &s;own, by the field|mice,
which mine their way very quickly under newly ploughed
lands near the &s;urface, is &s;aid by Mr. Wag&s;taff, in the papers
of the Bath Society, Vol. VI. to be effected in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons to
a very great extent. He adds, that the tu&s;&s;ocks of wheat, &s;een
to ari&s;e in many fields, are owing to the granaries of the&s;e dimi|nutive
animals; which he has often found to contain nearly an
hatful of corn, which grows into a tuft, if the owner becomes
accidentally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Mr. Wag&s;taff al&s;o a&s;&s;erts, that they feed much on the young
plants, as they ari&s;e from the &s;eed, and multiply at that time very
fa&s;t. He detects their habitations by &s;mall mounds of earth
being thrown up on or near the apertures of their dwellings, or
of the pa&s;&s;ages, which lead to their ne&s;ts or granaries; and by
following the cour&s;e of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages he found and de&s;troyed
the parents and the progeny.</P>
<P>Mr. Wagstaff recommends the taking up and dividing the
tu&s;&s;ocks of wheat, thus &s;own in the autumn by the field-mice,
and tran&s;planting them in the &s;pring; and also to thin other
parts of a young crop, as they appear too thickly &s;own, which
he e&s;teems an advantageous practice.</P>
<P>Acorns when &s;own, and garden beans, and peas, are liable
to be dug up or devoured by the&s;e voracious little animals,
which may be de&s;troyed by traps baited with chee&s;e; or be&s;t of
all by the encouragement of the breed of owls, &s;o active in the
pur&s;uit of nocturnal vermin, and thence &s;o u&s;eful to the gardener
and farmer, who &s;till permit their &s;ervants and children to de|&s;troy
both their eggs and callow young.</P>
<P>2. This country was infe&s;ted with two kinds of rats, the
hou&s;e-rat and the water-rat; but it is believed, that within the
la&s;t half century the water-rat has de&s;troyed the hou&s;e-rat. The
water-rats po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome kind of ingenuity &s;imilar to the beaver
in the con&s;truction of their hou&s;es near the brinks of rivers and
pools; which have two apertures, one above ground among&s;t
the gra&s;s, and the other beneath the &s;urface of the water; and
<PB N="334" REF="340">
unle&s;s they can hide their upper opening amid weeds or gra&s;s,
they for&s;ake the &s;ituation. Thus if a rim three or four feet in
breadth, round a fi&s;h-pound be kept &s;o low as to ri&s;e only two,
or three, or four inches above the level of the water; and if
this be kept clean from high gra&s;s, or weeds, the rats will de&s;ert
the pond.</P>
<P>I have &s;een a young water-rat devour a large leaf of water-plantain,
ali&s;ma plantago, and therefore &s;uppo&s;e that they occa|&s;ionally
prey on the foliage, as well as on the &s;eeds and fruits
of vegetables, and on young animals, as ducklings and rabbits.
As the&s;e animals, like the dog, are of a la&s;civious nature, and
as &s;ome materials have a &s;trong &s;cent, re&s;embling perhaps that
of their venereal orga&s;m, they are liable to be attracted by &s;uch
&s;mells, as dogs are, on the &s;ame account, I &s;uppo&s;e, inclined
to roll them&s;elves on putrid carrion; and male cats to eat ma|ram,
valerian, and cat-mint. On this account it is u&s;ual for
rat-catchers to avail them&s;elves of this propen&s;ity, and to mix
e&s;&s;ential oil of rhodium, or mu&s;k, with the poi&s;onous powders
of &s;trychnos nux vomica, or of delphinium &s;tavi&s;agria, or per|haps
of ar&s;enic.</P>
<P>The great injury to vegetation effected by the&s;e rats con&s;i&s;ts
in their making innumerable burrows beneath the &s;oil, and feed|ing
on the roots of a great variety of vegetables. Some new
planted apple-trees I remember to have &s;een taken out of the
ground with nearly the whole of their &s;maller roots eaten, and
the larger ones peeled by the&s;e reptiles. They will al&s;o de&s;troy
young ducks, young rabbits, and young chickens; and devour
with great avidity every kind of food, with which poultry and
&s;wine are u&s;ually fed; and are hence in many ways injurious in
&s;ituations near water.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent receipts for poi&s;oning this mi&s;chievous ver|min
are printed in the papers of the Bath Agricultural Society,
and &s;aid to have been attended with great &s;ucce&s;s. Fir&s;t, to a
quart of oatmeal add &s;ix drops of oil of rhodium, one grain of
mu&s;k, and two or three of the nuts of nux vomica finely pow|dered;
make it into pellets, and put them into the rat-holes.
This was at fir&s;t greedily eaten, and did great execution, but
the wi&s;e animals after a time cea&s;ed to eat it. The &s;econd con|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="335" REF="341">
of three parts of oatmeal, and one of &s;tavi&s;agria, &s;tave's-acre,
mixed well into a pa&s;te with honey. Pieces of this pa&s;te
were laid in their holes, and again did great execution. A
third method of de&s;troying them there recommended is by lay|ing
a large box down on its front &s;ide with the lid &s;upported
open by a &s;tring over a pully; and by trailing toa&s;ted chee&s;e,
and a red herring, from their holes to this box; and placing
oatmeal and other food in this box, which they are for a few
nights permitted to eat unmole&s;ted; and finally to watch them
by moonlight, the in&s;ide of the box being painted white;
and, when many of them are &s;een, to let down the lid; by
which contrivance &s;ixty of them were taken at once.</P>
<P>3. Moles, as well as rats, have occa&s;ionally increa&s;ed &s;o
greatly in numbers, as to much injure the agricultor; they per|forate
the earth near its &s;urface, and are &s;aid never to drink,
but to &s;eed on the roots of vegetable, as well as on &s;ubterraneous
in&s;ects; and though they are believed never to drink, yet they
have been &s;een occa&s;ionally to &s;wim over lakes of water to the
i&s;lands which they &s;urround, of which an ocular proof is relat|ed
in the tran&s;actions of the Linnean Society, Vol. III. 1797.
Some have recommended to inject the &s;moke of burning &s;ulphur,
or of tobacco, into their &s;ubterraneous man&s;ions; but as the
earth frequently falls in behind them, as they pa&s;s, or is accu|mulated
behind them by their hindermo&s;t feet, as they perforate
the &s;oil with their foremo&s;t feet or hands, this method of attack
can &s;eldom &s;ucceed, unle&s;s the ne&s;t of the animal be near the
fumigated aperture. Others have advi&s;ed to pour water into
their holes, which is equally inefficacious in general, though it
may have effect in particular &s;ituations. Some al&s;o have baited
traps with worms, and others have advi&s;ed to put poi&s;on into
their holes; but they are not to be attracted together like rats
from their not appearing above ground.</P>
<P>The following method was related to me by Francis Paget
of El&s;ton near Newark, a very popular and &s;ucce&s;sful mole|catcher,
whom I once attended in his occupation to witne&s;s his
operations. The moles have cities under ground, which con&s;i&s;t
of hou&s;es, or ne&s;ts, where they breed and $ur&s;e their young;
communicating with the&s;e are wider and more frequented &s;treets,
<PB N="336" REF="342">
made by the perpetual journeys of the male and female parents;
as well as many other le&s;s frequented allies or bye roads, with
many diverging branches, which they daily extend to collect
food for them&s;elves or their progeny.</P>
<P>This animal is more active in the vernal months, during the
time of the court&s;hip of the males; and many more burrows are
at this time made in the earth for their meeting with each other.
And though the&s;e animals are commonly e&s;teemed to be blind,
yet they appear to have &s;ome perception of light even in their
&s;ubterraneous habitations; becau&s;e they begin their work as
&s;oon as it is light, and con&s;equently before the warmth of the
&s;un can be &s;uppo&s;ed to affect them. Hence his method of de|&s;troying
them con&s;i&s;ted fir&s;t in attending their &s;ituation early
before &s;un-ri&s;e; and at that time he frequently could &s;ee the
earth move over them, or the gra&s;s upon it; and by a &s;mall
light &s;pade he frequently cut off their retreat, by &s;triking it into
the ground behind them, and then dug them up. He added,
that by laying the ear on a newly rai&s;ed mole-hill, the &s;ound
of the &s;cratching mole might &s;ometimes be heard at a di&s;tance,
and direct where to find it; as the &s;olid earth conveys &s;mall
vibrations better, or to a greater di&s;tance, than the light air.
And that a terrier dog, after having been accu&s;tomed to the
bu&s;ine&s;s, was frequently of &s;ervice in detecting by his no&s;e the
place of the mole beneath the &s;oil, and by endeavouring to
&s;cratch the earth over it.</P>
<P>The mole he &s;aid generally &s;uckles four or five, and &s;ome|times
six, young ones; which are placed con&s;iderably deeper
in the ground than their common runs; and as the&s;e ne&s;ts are
&s;unk much deeper into the ground than their &s;treets or bye-roads,
and the mole-hills con&s;equently larger, the earth on the &s;ummit
of tho&s;e mole-hills is generally of a different colour, and is rai&s;ed
higher than that of the other ones. These ne&s;ts are to be dug
up, having fir&s;t intercepted the canal between them and the
mole-hills in their vicinity, to cut off the retreat of the inha|bitants.</P>
<P>The next important circum&s;tance is to di&s;cover, which
are the frequented &s;treets, and which the bye-roads, for the
purpo&s;e of &s;etting &s;ubterraneous traps. This is effected by mak|ing
<PB N="337" REF="343">
a mark on every new mole-hill by a light pre&s;&s;ure of your
foot; and on the next morning by ob&s;erving whether a mole has
again pa&s;&s;ed that way, and obliterated the foot mark; and this
is to be done two or three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mornings. The&s;e foot|marks
&s;hould not be deeply impre&s;&s;ed, le&s;t it &s;hould alarm the
animal on his return, and he &s;hould form a new branch of road,
rather than open the ob&s;tructed one.</P>
<P>The traps are then to be &s;et in the frequented &s;treets, &s;o as
nicely to fit the divided canal. They con&s;i&s;t of a hollow &s;emicy|linder
of wood with grooved rings at each end of it, in which
are placed two noo&s;es of hor&s;ehair, one at each end, fa&s;tened
loo&s;ely by a peg in the center, and &s;tretched above ground by a
bent &s;tick. When the mole has pa&s;&s;ed half way through one of
the noo&s;es, and removes the central peg in his progre&s;&s;ion, the
bent &s;tick ri&s;es by its ela&s;ticity, and &s;trangulates the animal.
He added, that where the &s;oil was too moi&s;t or tenacious, that
the moles in pa&s;&s;ing the old ruins &s;ometimes pu&s;hed a little of it
before them, and thus loo&s;ened the central peg before they
were in the noo&s;e; in which ca&s;e he fixed the peg a little fa&s;ter
in the trap.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means Francis Paget cleared many of the neighbour|ing
pari&s;hes of this kind of vermin in a few days, or a week or
two, and laid them under an annual tax for the defence of their
territories from the&s;e invaders. And added, that &s;ome other mole|catchers
had carried moles into tho&s;e farms, who&s;e occu|piers
refu&s;ed to pay them an annual &s;tipend, a practice which he
&s;corned to u&s;e. I have detailed this method to prevent this
impo&s;ition, and to enable every farmer to be his own mole-catcher,
or to teach the art to his &s;ervants.</P>

<P>THE objects of the culture of the farm or garden may be di|vided
into the production of fruits, seeds, roots, barks, woods,
leaves, and flowers.</P>
<P>We have repeatedly endeavoured to &s;hew, that the buds im|mediately
arising from &s;eeds are not them&s;elves capable of pro|ducing
&s;eads neither in herbaceous nor in arbore&s;cent vegetables;
but that the fir&s;t bud from every &s;eed is &s;ucceeded by a &s;econd
bud more perfect than it&s;elf; and that by a third, fourth, or
many more; each generation being more perfect than the pre|ceding
one, till they acquire a puberty, if it may be &s;o called&punc;
or a power of producing &s;exual organs, and a con&s;equent &s;emi|nal
progeny.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e plants, which are called annuals, becau&s;e their &s;eeds
are &s;own, and produce other &s;eeds, in the &s;ame year, and then
peri&s;h, &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;ive buds grow on each other, before a flower
can be produced; as is &s;een in the &s;tems of wheat, and &s;owthi&s;|tle,
triticum, &s;ouchus; which con&s;i&s;t of joints, which appear
to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ive buds growing on each other.</P>
<P>From the tulip &s;eed a single bud ari&s;es the first year with a
circular flat caudex exi&s;ting beneath it, on which one principal
new bulb is formed annually more perfect than its parent, as is
&s;een by the larger leaf; and al&s;o &s;ome le&s;s bulbs are produced
<PB N="342" REF="347">
around the more perfect one in the bo&s;om of each rudiment of a
leaf, which compo&s;es or enclo&s;es the principal bulb, as de&s;cribed
in Sect. VII. 1. 3. and Sect. IX. 3. 1. and 3. 6. The&s;e le&s;s
perfect bulbs round the principal one, after the principal one has
acquired its puberty, or power of producing &s;exual organs, are of
greater or le&s;s degree of maturity, as appears by their &s;ize; and
thence I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t require more or fewer years, before they
flower.</P>
<P>Similar to this circum&s;tance of the tulip-root, the buds of
trees, which fir&s;t ari&s;e from the &s;eed, produce annually other
buds more perfect than them&s;elves, till they acquire the power
of &s;eminal generation; and afterwards not only a flower-bud is
formed, which is in &s;ome trees the central bud on the extremity
of the twig, as in pear-trees, and on the &s;purs of apple-tree; but
al&s;o many leaf-buds of greater or le&s;s maturity are formed around
the principal, or flower-bud; which require more or fewer
years, before they obtain the maturity nece&s;&s;ary to produce a
flower.</P>
<P>It was &s;hewn in Sect VII. 1. 7. that every part of the long
caudex, extending from a bud on the &s;ummit of a tree to the
root, can produce a bud, like every part of the broad caudex
of a tulip-root; but tho&s;e produced in the bo&s;om of the leaf I
believe generally to be the mo&s;t mature; and tho&s;e which ari&s;e
from a lower part of the caudex to be le&s;s mature, and will in
con&s;equence require more &s;ucce&s;&s;ive buds to proceed from them,
before they can form a flower. Thus when the whole branches
of a fruit-tree are lopped from the trunk, the new buds are pro|duced
from the lower parts of the caudexes of the branch-buds,
which have been lopped off, and are therefore an immature pro|geny,
and require &s;ome years before they can flower.</P>
<P>It hence appears, that a number of buds or bulbs in all vege|tables
must &s;ucceed each other from the &s;eed, before a flower
and con&s;equent fruit can be generated; but that the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
generations are more numerous or fewer in &s;ome plants than in
others; that they in &s;ome plants may only &s;ucceed each other
annually; in others perhaps many of them in the &s;ame &s;ummer,
as in the herbaceous plants, as wheat: and in tho&s;e trees, who&s;e
annual joints have their pith divided from each other, as in vines.
<PB N="343" REF="348">
And la&s;tly, that the number of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations, or
the times of their production, whether only annually, or many
of them in one &s;ummer, may be dimini&s;hed or accelerated, by
art; and that in attending to all the&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;i&s;ts the
&s;ucce&s;sful management of fruit-trees.</P>
<P>The new buds on deciduous trees in this climate are produced
about Mid&s;ummer, as ob&s;erved in Sect. IX. 2. 9; and it is believ|ed
by the Linnean &s;chool, that many of them at this time may be
&s;o affected by art, as to become either leaf-buds or flower-buds.
At this &s;ea&s;on therefore the production of buds on wall-trees,
or e&s;paliers, or on &s;tandards, &s;hould employ the attention of
the horticultor; as tho&s;e &s;eedling-trees produce leaf-buds only,
which are too young to produce flower-buds; and as the par|ticular
&s;hoots or buds of other trees are not &s;o mature as to pro|duce
flower-buds; and la&s;tly, as &s;ome trees flouri&s;h too vigo|rou&s;ly,
as it is termed, to produce flower-buds. The things to
be attended to are the age of the tree, from which the graft
was taken, which now forms a branch; the maturity of the
particular buds, which you wi&s;h to encourage; and the vigour
of the whole tree, or its tendency to produce leaf-buds in pre|ference
to flower-buds.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>I. TO PRODUCE FRUIT-BEARING TREES.</HEAD>
<P>1. There are four methods of procuring fruit-trees for the
purpo&s;es of horticulture, by &s;eeds, by root-&s;uckers, by planted
&s;cions, or by ingrafted &s;cions.</P>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>1. Of Seedling trees.</HEAD>
<P>It was ob&s;erved above in Section IX. 3. 1. and 3. 6. that in
tulips and hyacinths, and even in potatoes and onions, the bulbs
&s;ucceed each other for two or three years or longer, before they
produce flowers; and that the &s;ame happens to the buds of &s;eed|ling-trees,
which are many years a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of leaf-buds only,
before the propagation of a &s;ingle flower-bud; for the power,
which produces the lateral germination of buds, &s;eems to require
a le&s;e mature organization than that, which is employed in the
<PB N="344" REF="349">
&s;exual generation of &s;eeds; whence a kind of puberty of the
plant &s;eems to be acquired for the production of the &s;eminal or
amatorial progeny, analogous to the transformation of caterpillars
into butterflies; which appears to be effected &s;olely for the pur|pose
of propagation.</P>
<P>M. Speechly, in his treati&s;e on the culture of the Vine, p. 49,
&s;eems to &s;ay, that &s;eedling vines mu&s;t be three or four years
old, before they produce fruit; whereas a planted &s;cion, or an
ingrafted one, from an aged tree, will produce fruit the fir&s;t
or &s;econd year; and according to the ob&s;ervations of Mr.
Knight, &s;eedling apple-trees will not bear fruit till they are
twelve or fourteen years old; and other fruit trees in &s;imilar
manner require &s;ome years after their birth from the &s;eed, before
they arrive at &s;ufficient maturity to bear flowers. See Sect. VII.
1. 3. Hence he advi&s;es the horticultor to procure &s;cions for
grafting from &s;uch trees as already bear fruit; but pays no regard
to the &s;tock, into which they are to be in&s;erted; and adds, that
he believes, if &s;cions from a bearing walnut or mulberry tree
were ingrafted on a &s;eedling one, that it would produce fruit in
two or three years; which otherwi&s;e would not occur in le&s;s
than twenty. Treati&s;e on Apple and Pear. Longman, London.
And hence we &s;ee the advantage of ingrafting on &s;eedling orange
or lemon-trees in our green-hou&s;es the &s;cions taken from tho&s;e,
which bear fruit; as otherwi&s;e they would continue &s;o many
years before the buds would acquire &s;ufficient maturity to gene|rate
flowers.</P>
<P>Some have believed that young trees will bear fruit &s;ooner, if
they are not pruned, but permitted to grow quite wild in large
bu&s;hes. It is po&s;&s;ible, that this may occur either from the un|&s;kilful
horticultor pruning off all die terminal twigs, who&s;e buds
were forwarder in re&s;pect to age, than the lateral ones much
beneath them. Or becau&s;e the great number of new leaf-buds,
proceeding from an exuberant branching head, may &s;o crowd
the bark of the trunk with their caudexes, that &s;ome of them
may &s;ooner find a difficulty in forming their embryon caudexes,
and may in con&s;equence become flower-buds. But I much
doubt, that this can frequently occur from either cau&s;e, as I
think, I have &s;een e&s;paliers bear &s;ome years &s;ooner than stan|dards,
<PB N="345" REF="350">
which were ingrafted at the &s;ame time, and from the
&s;ame trees. And I have been informed of other &s;eedling apple-trees,
which have borne fruit in not much more than half the
time above mentioned by Mr. Knight.</P>
<P>It is much to be wi&s;hed, that proper experiments were made
on &s;eedling trees, by planting them as e&s;paliers, or again&s;t walls,
and bending down their branches below the horizon, &s;ince the
difficulty of their generating leaf-buds might be thus increa&s;ed;
as they could not &s;o ea&s;ily form their embryon caudexes on the
compre&s;&s;ed bark of the bended branch; and the &s;ap-juice for
the nouri&s;hment of fruit-buds would be thus rather increa&s;ed than
dimini&s;hed, according to an experiment of Dr. Walker, who
found the buds at the extremities of bended branches to &s;well
&s;ooner in the &s;ea&s;on, and to become larger, than tho&s;e of an
equal height on the more upright branches. Edinburgh Tran|sactions,
Vol. I.</P>
<P>Mr. Bradley has mentioned an apple, which was &s;weet and
boiled &s;oft on one &s;ide, and four and boiled hard on the other;
and a&s;cribed it probably to the real cau&s;e with much ingenuity
in the year 1721, long before the publication of the &s;y&s;tem of
Linneus. He a&s;cribes it to the male farina of &s;ome neighbour|ing
har&s;h apple-tree affecting at the time of the impregnation
the &s;tigma of the flower of a &s;weet one; and thus a production
of different &s;eeds might be generated in the &s;ame pericarp, and
a con&s;equent different kind of nutriment prepared for each;
and thus the different parts of the apple become four or &s;weet,
which is analogous to a bitch producing different kinds of puppies
at the &s;ame birth, re&s;embling the different dogs with which &s;he
had cohabited. The &s;ame circum&s;tance is &s;aid to have occurred
in oranges and in grapes of different kinds.</P>
<P>By this method of applying the farina of one good variety of
fruit, as of apple or pear, to the &s;tigma of another good variety,
it is very probable, that &s;ome very excellent new varieties of
fruit might be produced from the &s;eeds, which might &s;upply for
a century the orchards of the curious, in&s;tead of our golden
pippins, and nonpareils; which are &s;aid to be &s;uperannuated,
and &s;o liable to canker as not to be worth cultivation. It is
probable al&s;o, that new varieties of tulips and hyacinths, and of
<PB N="346" REF="351">
melons and cucumbers, as well as of all other vegetables, might
be thus produced.</P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervations are from Mr. Knight's treati&s;e on
Apple and pear, p. 47. &startq;Every &s;eed, though taken from the
&s;ame apple,&endq; furni&s;hes a new and di&s;tinct variety; and &s;ome of
the&s;e will grow with more luxuriance than others; and the
fruits produced by the different plants will po&s;&s;e&s;s different de|grees
of merit; but an e&s;timate may be made of their good and
bad qualities, at the conclu&s;ion of the fir&s;t &s;ummer by the re&s;em|blance
the leaves bear to the highly cultivated, or to the wild
kinds; as has been remarked by the writers on this &s;ubject of
the la&s;t century. The plants, who&s;e buds in the annual wood
are full and prominent, are u&s;ually more productive than tho&s;e
who&s;e buds are &s;mall and &s;hrunk into the bark; but their future
produce will depend much on the power the blo&s;&s;oms po&s;&s;e&s;s
of bearing cold; and this power varies in the different varieties,
and can only be known from experience. Tho&s;e, which pro|duce
their leaves and blo&s;&s;oms rather early in the &s;pring, are
generally to be preferred; for though they are more expo&s;ed to
injury from fro&s;t, they le&s;s frequently &s;uffer from the attacks of
in&s;ects, the more common cau&s;e of failure.</P>
<P>&startq;The leaves of young &s;eedling plants annually change,&endq; be|come

<HEAD>2. Of Root-&s;cions.</HEAD>
<P>Root-&s;uckers from bearing bur-apples, or from bearing cod|lings,
are believed to become fruitful as soon as grafts from tho&s;e
trees; becau&s;e they are a viviparous offspring, as well as the
&s;cions or twigs from the branches; and are therefore not &s;imilar
to the oviparous progeny, or the young trees produced from &s;eeds.
This mu&s;t neverthele&s;s in great mea&s;ure depend upon the age of
the &s;ucker; as tho&s;e root-buds, which, ri&s;e into &s;uckers, are not
<PB N="347" REF="352">
formed or generated in the bo&s;om of a leaf, but from a part of
one of the long caudexes of a branch-bud; and will therefore, I
&s;uppo&s;e, require a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of buds for &s;ome years, before they
will acquire a &s;ufficient maturity to produce a flower; as the cen|tral
buds from the bo&s;om of a leaf I &s;uppo&s;e to be much forwarder
than the lateral buds from the &s;ame caudex; as is &s;een in the cen|tral
or flower-bulb of a tulip, and its immature lateral bulbs from
the &s;ame caudex.</P>
<P>Root-&s;uckers from tho&s;e trees, which have been ingrafted on
the roots of other trees, as the robinia on the acacia, may ari&s;e
above the grafted part, which is beneath the &s;oil; but tho&s;e root-&s;uckers,
which ari&s;e from trees, which were grafted above ground,
are &s;imilar to the &s;tock, not to the fruit-bearing head; which
might have been a wild pear or wild apple; and will in that ca&s;e
produce crab-pears, or crab-apples, with thorny &s;tems.</P>
<P>When a branch of a vine, or briar, or of many other trees,
is bent down, and a part of it in&s;erted into the ground with its
&s;ummit in the air, it will emit roots at the joints, and become a
new tree. So the rough knobs on the bark of a bur-apple-tree,
I am informed, will &s;hoot out roots, if &s;urrounded with moi&s;t
earth; and the branch may be then cut off, and &s;ucce&s;sfully plant|ed.
And from almo&s;t every joint of a fig-tree roots will pro|trude,
if &s;urrounded even with a woollen &s;hred, which happens
to be frequently moi&s;tened by the dews or rain; and the branch
may be &s;ucce&s;sfully bent down and planted in a garden-pot.
All the&s;e, like &s;uckers from the roots of &s;eedling-trees, or like
grafted &s;cions, will become fertile, as &s;oon as the tree, from
which they are the offspring; whether it be a &s;eedling-tree or not.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance does not occur exactly &s;imilar in the in&s;erti|on
of buds from one tree into the bark of another; as tho&s;e buds,
which do not ari&s;e from the bo&s;om of a leaf, but from lower parts
of the caudexes of a branch-bud, as from the bark of a branch,
who&s;e &s;ummit has been cut off, are le&s;s mature, I believe, than the
&s;ummit-buds, or tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the bo&s;om of a leaf; and
will therefore require &s;ome years before they can produce flowers;
as is &s;een in tho&s;e apple or pear trees, who&s;e &s;ummits have been
entirely lopped off. This is a new ob&s;ervation, I believe, and
worth the attention of tho&s;e, who inoculate the buds of one
fruit tree into another.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="353">
Root-&s;uckers may probably be liable to degenerate in re&s;pect
to their vigorous growth by hereditary di&s;ea&s;es, owing to the too
great age of the original plant of that variety, like the ingrafted
&s;cions from the branches. Whence it may be nece&s;&s;ary to pro|cure
root-&s;uckers of ra&s;pberry-plants, and of goo&s;eberries, and
even of artichokes, and &s;trawberries, from &s;uch as have been
rai&s;ed from &s;eed not too long ago, when any of the&s;e begin to
degenerate.</P>

<DIV5>
<HEAD>3. Of Planted Scions.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;cions taken from the branches of many trees, if planted
in the earth, will emit roots, and flouri&s;h in the &s;ame manner,
as when they are grafted on other trees. This &s;ucceeds with
great certainty, if an inverted gla&s;s be put over them for a few
days to prevent their per&s;piring more at fir&s;t, than their ab&s;orbent
ve&s;&s;els can &s;upply. See Sect. I. 1. I have been informed, that
a quick&s;et, or hawthorn hedge, crataegus, was thus planted and
became a good fence con&s;iderably &s;ooner than from &s;owing the
&s;eed.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e are &s;aid by &s;ir G. Staunton to be unacquainted
with the art of ingrafting, and to produce dwarf fruit-trees,
which are brought to table loaded with fruit at their fe&s;ti|vals,
by &s;urrounding a branch of a bearing fruit-tree at its bifur|cation
with a bag of earth, which is kept moi&s;t for &s;ome months;
till the branch puts out roots, probably from the lips of a wound
in the bark, and is at length &s;eparated, and tran&s;planted into a
pot. Emba&s;&s;y to China, Vol. II. p. 54. 8vo. edition; and it is
then rendered a dwarf by repeatedly cutting out the central buds,
as in the management of melons, as mentioned in No. 2. 5. and
3. 2. of this Section.</P>
<P>Vines po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o vigorous a power of vegetation, that the pre|&s;ent

the world the art of making artificial magnets, which had been
concealed by Mr. Knight; who&s;e friend&s;hip I long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and
who&s;e lo&s;s I have long lamented; amu&s;ed him&s;elf and family
<PB N="349" REF="354">
at vacant hours in his hot-hou&s;e. The ob&s;ervations of a man of
&s;uch accurate and univer&s;al knowledge are always worth record|ing;
and though his ideas on this &s;ubject have already appeared
in Mr. Speechly's Culture of the Vine, I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe a
part of one of his letters to me dated in May 1785.</P>
<P>&startq;The way in which we rai&s;e our vines we account our own;&endq;
for I don't know, that it was practi&s;ed by any body before we
&s;et the example. It is now pretty generally adopted however
by the gardeners and nur&s;erymen in this part of the world.
In&s;tead of leaving three or four eyes on the cuttings, as u&s;ed
formerly to be done, which made them awkward &s;traggling
things, we never plant more than a &s;ingle eye to each, cutting
them with as long a part below the eye as they can admit,
without encroaching too much upon the next eye below; that
is to &s;ay, we leave perhaps about half an inch, or a little more,
as it may happen, above it. The&s;e cuttings we plant by half a
dozen or a dozen together, at the di&s;tance of three, four, or
five inches, in the bark-bed, where it is pretty warm, but not
&s;o hot as to endanger the burning of the roots, when they &s;hall
come out; and where it is al&s;o pretty moi&s;t, or el&s;e we water
them. We plant them &s;loping so as to make an angle of about
thirty degrees perhaps, a little more or le&s;s, with the horizon,
the eye being highe&s;t; but taking care that it al&s;o &s;hall be
covered about an inch with the bark, which is a very nece&s;|&s;ary
precaution; for though it ought ju&s;t to <HI>&s;mell</HI> the fre&s;h air,
it mu&s;t be kept moi&s;t, to prevent the bud and &s;hoot, when it
comes, from drying; otherwi&s;e it will very frequently die away
pre&s;ently after it has &s;hot a little, or at be&s;t it will grow unkind|ly,
not having yet made roots &s;ufficient to &s;upply it with the &s;ap
nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;upport; which will not be the ca&s;e, if the bud
is &s;ufficiently covered at fir&s;t, and till it has acquired more
roots.</P>
<P>&startq;We generally plant our vines in this way,&endq; about the begin|ning
or middle of January; and if the bark is pretty warm,
and as moi&s;t as it &s;hould be, the cuttings will begin
to pu&s;h both at top and bottom in about a fortnight or three weeks at the
mo&s;t. When the vines have &s;hot a little, perhaps three or four
inches, but before the roots are got too long, (in which ca&s;e it
<PB N="350" REF="355">
would be impo&s;&s;ible to avoid breaking them by removing, on ac|count
of their extreme tenderne&s;s and brittlene&s;s) we di&s;place a
good deal of the bark very near them, till we can throw them
down all together, which &s;hakes the bark very gently from their
roots; &s;o that one may di&s;engage them &s;ufficiently ea&s;y, and
without much hurting them. We then plant three or four of
the mo&s;t promi&s;ing and thriving ones out of the whole number
&s;ingly in &s;mall pots in earth, which has previou&s;ly &s;tood in the
hot-hou&s;e a day or two to get warm, letting the roots drop down
on a little earth at the bottom, at fir&s;t, as they conveniently
can, and then covering them with more earth carefully, till the
pot is properly filled, and the &s;tem about three or four inches
long, as I &s;aid before, &s;tanding in the middle; and then plenti|fully
watering the earth to &s;ettle it to the roots. We now
plunge them again in the bark, where in five or &s;ix weeks, more
or le&s;s, they will have filled their pots pretty well with roots;
when they will begin to &s;hew by their little progre&s;s, and the
&s;mallne&s;s of the &s;hoots, that they want more room. We then
take them carefully out of the&s;e &s;mall pots, di&s;turbing the ball
of earth as little as po&s;&s;ible, and put it all together into larger
pots, putting a little fre&s;h earth at bottom and round about, and
watering well as before; and we then again plunge them into
the bark.</P>
<P>&startq;By about the latter end of May, or beginning of June,
the be&s;t of them will be four or five, or perhaps &s;ix feet high,
and ought now to be removed, di&s;turbing the roots as little as
po&s;&s;ible, into the natural ground, where they are to remain. If
this is done carefully, and the earth well watered about them
to &s;ettle it to their roots, they will frequently begin growing
again almo&s;t immediately, but at lea&s;t in three or four days;
and will then often &s;hoot in the hot-hou&s;e two inches in a day,
and by the end of the year will have &s;hot from eighteen or
nineteen, to three, four, or five and twenty feet. Though we
approve of this as rather the be&s;t, yet if the&s;e cuttings are plant|ed
in the &s;ame way either &s;ingly in &s;mall pots, or two or three
together in each, with earth, in&s;tead of planting them in the
bark, de&s;troying all but the be&s;t one, when they have &s;hot a
little, and plunging them either in the bark, or in default of a
<PB N="351" REF="356">
bark-bed, in a common hot-bed, they will do equally, or nearly
equally well; only taking care, that the hot-bed it not too hot,
&s;o as to injure the roots, of which there is &s;ometimes danger.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>4. Of Ingrafted Scions.</HEAD>
<P>The art of ingrafting trees is of great antiquity, and is at|tended
with numerous well known advantages, but is not yet
arrived to its utmo&s;t perfection; for it is not yet certainly
known, whether the ingrafted &s;cion gives or takes any property
to or from the tree, which receives it, except that it acquires
nouri&s;hment from it.</P>
<P>There is one in&s;tance recorded by Bradley, where the &s;cion
of a variegated ja&s;&s;amine gave variegation to the leaves beneath
it of the unvariegated ja&s;&s;amine, on which it was ingrafted,
though the graft it&s;elf peri&s;hed. See Sect. V. 1. This &s;eems
to &s;hew that a communication of juices exi&s;ts between the graft
and the &s;tock; and that thus &s;ome change in the colour of the
leaves of the &s;tock might be occa&s;ioned by the ino&s;culation of
the ve&s;&s;els of the new bud with tho&s;e of other buds in its vici|nity.
Thus if a &s;cion of a purple grape was ingrafted on a
white one, the leaves of the latter might probably become &s;ome|what
red in the autumn, like tho&s;e of the purple-vine; but
there are no in&s;tances recorded, where this communication of
juices from the graft to the &s;tock, or from the &s;tock to the graft,
has varied the flavour or the form of the flowers, or fruit of
either of them.</P>
<P>For though the &s;ame vegetable blood pa&s;&s;es along both the
upper and lower part of the caudex of the new &s;cion, which
extends from its &s;ummit on the branch to its ba&s;e in the earth;
yet the molecules &s;ecreted from this blood are &s;elected or form|ed
by the different glands of the part of the caudex, which
was brought with the ingrafted &s;cion, and of the part of it
which remained on the &s;tock, in the &s;ame manner as different
kinds of &s;ecretions are produced from the &s;ame blood in ani|mal
bodies.</P>
<P>Some have neverthele&s;s believed, that &s;cions, ingrafted on
more vigorous trees of the &s;ame genus, have acquired greater
<PB N="352" REF="357">
vigour in the growth both of their leaf-buds and fruit-buds.
Mr Speechly a&s;&s;erts, that he has improved many kinds of vines
by ingrafting tho&s;e, which bear &s;mall grapes, and which have
generally weak wood, on &s;tronger ones, which he has often ex|perienced;
and recommends the Syrian vine to graft upon, and
prefers tho&s;e, which were rai&s;ed from &s;eed for this purpo&s;e; and
the contrary &s;eems to appear, where more vigorous &s;cions have
been ingrafted on le&s;s vigorous &s;tocks; as apple-&s;cions on crab|&s;tocks;
where in a few years the part above the grafted joint
becomes much larger in diameter than that below it.</P>
<P>Grafted &s;cions &s;ucceed well in general on trees of the &s;ame
genus, as in the common ingraftment of fruit-trees; &s;o the
laurel, prunus lauro-cera&s;us, will grow on the common cherry,
prunus cera&s;us, and produce a tall evergreen tree. But there
are &s;aid to be in&s;tances al&s;o of &s;ucce&s;s in the ingraftment of
trees not only of different genera, but even of different orders,
and cla&s;&s;es; as I have been informed, that apple-&s;cions, pyrus
malus, have grown, when ingrafted on hazels, corylus. And
one of the fathers of the Carthu&s;ian order is &s;aid to have &s;uc|ceeded
in grafting a vine, vitis, on a fig-tree, ficus; and a
ja&s;&s;amine on an orange. Travels in France and Italy, by E.
Wright. It is hence probable, that many new di&s;coveries
might be made by more frequent experiments on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It neverthele&s;s appears that in grafted trees, though the &s;tock
annually becomes covered with a new bark, as well as the graft,
yet it does not change its nature; &s;ince any new buds, which
come out from the &s;tock afterwards, are &s;imilar to the &s;tock,
not to the graft; and in many trees the graft grows &s;o much
fa&s;ter as to become nearly of double the diameter of the &s;tock,
as is frequently &s;een in old cherry-trees, and is &s;poken of in Sect.
VII. 1. 7.</P>
<P>Thus the buds of fruit-trees, like the bulbs of tulips, when
rai&s;ed from &s;eed, annually improve in their colour, length,
thickne&s;s, and often in the &s;hape of their leaves, for a certain
number of years; and then acquire a male, or a female, organ
of reproduction, as in the cla&s;&s;es of monoecia, an dioecia; or
both, as in hermaphrodite flowers. After this period the cen|tral
buds and bulbs annually produced are in every re&s;pect simi|lar
<PB N="353" REF="358">
to their parents, as mentioned in Sect VII. 1. 3. except in
the nearer progre&s;s to old age of the tree, or of the bulb-pro|geny;
and the con&s;equent tendency to hereditary di&s;ea&s;es. But
the lateral buds from the lower parts of the caudex of the cen|tral
ones, which are not generated in the bo&s;oms of leaves, are
of a more immature kind, and in that re&s;pect do not re&s;emble
the central bud, or bulb; but require &s;ome years before they
flower.</P>
<P>Mr. Knight has ob&s;erved, that the grafts from tho&s;e fruit-trees,
which have been in public e&s;timation for a century or two, are
now &s;o liable to canker, that they bear very little fruit, and are
not worth cultivation; which he a&s;cribes to the age of the tree;
as a graft he &s;ays is &s;imply an elongation of the parent tree.
And as it demands &s;ome years to acquire the puberty nece&s;&s;ary
for sexual generation, &s;o it may become weak and inirritable by
age, and peri&s;h about the &s;ame time with the orignal tree;
which is &s;omewhat countenanced by another remark of Mr.
Knight, that the &s;ummits, or long extremities of old trees, fre|quently
die many years before &s;ome &s;maller branches from the
trunk, which continue to flouri&s;h, as is frequently &s;een in old
oaks as well as in fruit-trees; and which he might &s;uppo&s;e to
be occa&s;ioned by the greater age of the terminal buds than of
the lateral ones, as well as from the greater length of their ab|&s;orbent
ve&s;&s;els, and the con&s;equent greater re&s;i&s;tance to the
a&s;cent of the &s;ap-juice, which may al&s;o be &s;ooner impeded, or
totally &s;topped by the inirritability of old age.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s as the buds of trees are &s;ucce&s;&s;ive progenies, and
cannot therefore be liable to old age, as they die annually&punc; the
degeneracy of the buds of very old trees, or of tho&s;e which
have long &s;ucceeded each other by their lateral, and not by
&s;exual generation, mu&s;t ari&s;e from their being liable to heredi|tary
di&s;ea&s;es only, and not to heredttary improvements, as ob|&s;erved
above in Sect. XIV. 1. 6.</P>
<P>That the degeneracy of &s;ome plants is owing to hereditary
di&s;ea&s;es, and not to old age, appears from their continuing for
long uncounted periods of time after the production of the&s;e
di&s;ea&s;es, as berberries without &s;eeds, and vines without &s;eeds, and
&s;trawberries without fruit, though probably with &s;eeds, as the
<PB N="354" REF="359">
barren ha$tbois &s;trawberries, which bear no fruit, &s;o called,
have perfect &s;tamina and pi&s;tilla, as I this day ob&s;erved with a
good lens; to which may be added tho&s;e female figs which
have no aperture to admit impregnation, and the mon&s;trous
double flowers, which have lo&s;t the power of &s;eminal propaga|tion,
and &s;ome mule-plants, which never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>We have nothing in the animal &s;y&s;tem, except in the poly|pus,
and a few ob&s;cure in&s;ects, &s;imilar to lateral generation;
and cannot therefore decidedly argue on this &s;ubject. Nor have
we any thing &s;imilar to ingraftment in animals, except that of
inflamed parts growing together, the tran&s;plantation of teeth,
and con&s;truction of artificial no&s;es from the &s;kin of the patient's
arm, &s;eriou&s;ly delivered by Talicotius, with many engraved
plates in a work on that &s;ubject. But this ingraftment of no&s;es
was unfortunately burle&s;qued by the author of Hudibras; and
perhaps this ingenious idea of Mr. Knight, that the ingrafted
&s;cion becomes di&s;ea&s;ed by age, and peri&s;hes about the &s;ame time
with the parent tree, may be liable to a &s;imilar ridicule by &s;ome
future writer on gardening.</P>

<P>There is an apple &s;aid to exi&s;t at New York in America,
which is a&s;&s;erted to be &s;our on one &s;ide of it, and &s;weet on the
other &s;ide; and to have been produced by &s;litting a &s;cion of a
&s;our apple, and another &s;imilar one of a &s;weet apple, taking
care to cut the buds of each &s;cion with a very &s;harp knife ex|actly
in half, and by applying them and binding them nicely to|gether,
and then ingrafting this double &s;cion on a tree. I men|tion
this, as it is related by Mr. Jay in the communications to
the Board of Agriculture, Vol. I. part 3 and 4, p. 362; and is
referred to in the Memoirs of the American Academy. Vol. I.
p. 386. But there mu&s;t undoubtedly have been &s;ome mi&s;take
<PB N="355" REF="360">
in re&s;pect to the production of &s;uch an apple by any method
of grafting, and which is &s;o well explained as above by Mr.
Bradley.</P>
<P>It only remains here to add in re&s;pect to grafting, that it is
nece&s;&s;ary to apply the bark, which contains or con&s;i&s;ts of the
caudex of the young &s;cion, exactly to the bark of the branch,
into which it is in&s;erted, or applied; and then all &s;pecies of in|grafting
&s;ucceeds, whether it is performed on a branch or on a
root; and whether by exci&s;ion, or inoculation, or inarching.
But I &s;u&s;pect, that where a &s;ingle bud is inoculated, it has
often failed from the un&s;kilful operator having &s;elected a flower-bud
in&s;tead of a leaf-bud; which probably unites its caudex to
those of the &s;tock with le&s;s vigour, and certainly dies after it has
ripened its &s;eed; or by his imprudently holding the bud in his
mouth, as he a&s;cends the ladder, or while he makes the inci&s;ion,
and thus de&s;troying it by heat, as I once ob&s;erved. A leaf-bud
may in general be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a flower-bud by its being
&s;harper pointed and le&s;s &s;pherical.</P>
<P>Where the &s;ummits of very young &s;cions of only a few weeks
old are to be u&s;ed to ingraft with and upon, it may be nece&s;&s;ary
al&s;o to apply the pith exactly to the pith; as this &s;ummit bud is
yet a primary being, and not like a lateral one, who&s;e whole
caudex exi&s;ts in the bark, which adheres to it, when it is taken
off for inoculation.</P>
<P>The choice of buds for the purpo&s;e of inoculation is probably
of more con&s;equence than has hitherto been imagined. As we
have endeavoured to &s;hew, that buds from parts of the bark
di&s;tant from the central bud, and which are not generated in
the bo&s;om of a leaf, are in different &s;tates of maturity; they
mu&s;t require more years before they can produce a &s;exual pro|geny
of flowers, and a con&s;equent &s;eminal offspring, with the
re&s;ervoir of nutriment or fruit, which attends it. A &s;ubject
which is new, and merits to be further inquired into.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve, that when har&s;her fruits become
&s;weeter, that the blo&s;&s;om becomes whiter, as is univer&s;ally &s;een
in tho&s;e of our native crabs, and of our cultivated apples; and
that the buds become larger, and the green leaves al&s;o become
of larger area, and of paler complexion.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="361">
Thus Mr. Knight ob&s;erves, &startq;that the width and thickne&s;s of
the leaves generally indicate the &s;ize of the future apple; and
the colour of the black cherry and purple grape may be known
by their autumnal tints; and that even in plants, which have
&s;prung from &s;eed in the preceding &s;pring; as the tinging matter
in the leaves of the&s;e plants is probably of the &s;ame kind as that,
to which the fruits will in future owe their colour.&endq; The
leaves of the purple grape become quite red in autumn, as well
as tho&s;e of the geranium robertianum, and many other kinds of
foliage, which I &s;uppo&s;e may be owing to their abundancy of
acid, which uniting with the blue part of what con&s;titutes along
with the yellow part the green colour of vegetable leaves, con|verts
it to red; as it changes the colour of blue flowers into red
ones.</P>

<HEAD>II. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FRUIT-BUDS.</HEAD>
<P>The terms &s;trength and weakne&s;s, in their u&s;ual acceptation,
when applied to the vegetation of trees, are metaphorical ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
or denote the effect or consequence, rather than the
cau&s;e, of their bearing leaf-buds or flower-buds, as &s;poken of in
Sect. IX. 2. 7. For the production of leaf-buds, or flower-buds,
though it may be &s;aid to accompany the greater or le&s;s
vigour of a tree, depends on the facility or difficulty, with
which the long caudexes of the new buds, which con&s;titute the
filaments of the bark, can be generated.</P>
<P>Thus the new vegetable production formed in the axilla of a
leaf about Mid&s;ummer, which is called a leaf-bud, con&s;i&s;ts&punc; of
many embryon buds, perhaps twenty or thirty, which are to
<PB N="357" REF="362">
form the next year's &s;hoot; and each of the&s;e mu&s;t be fur|ni&s;hed
at the &s;ame time with a long caudex in miniature, ex|tending
from the leaf or &s;ummit to its radicle or ba&s;e; which
con&s;i&s;ts of umbilical ve&s;&s;els for its vernal nutriment, and of a
continuation of other ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, and of arteries and
veins, as de&s;cribed in Sect. VII. 1. 7. which pa&s;&s;es along the
branches and trunk from the apex or leaf of the bud in the air
to its ba&s;e or radicle in the ground; and which thus forms the
new bark, and contributes to thicken and &s;trengthen the trunk
and branches of the tree; becau&s;e each new leaf-bud with its
&s;ummit, caudex, and radicle, continues afterwards to adhere to
the parent tree.</P>
<P>But the production in the axilla of a leaf, which is called a
flower-bud, or fruit-bud, con&s;i&s;ts only of an individual vegeta|ble
with the rudiments of a number of flowers, with one caudex
for its growth and nutriment; for as the &s;eed falls from the
tree, when ripe, no new apparatus of caudexes in miniature
for each individual &s;eed, as for each individual embryon-bud, is
required to pa&s;s down the trunk into the ground to form a new
bark; and thus to thicken and to &s;trengthen the trunk and
branches.</P>
<P>Add to this, that not only the &s;eeds require no new caudexes
to pa&s;s down the trunk, but that probably die &s;tamina and coral
of each flower &s;trike their roots only into the blood ve&s;&s;els,
which communicate with the bractes, like mo&s;&s;es or fungu&s;es,
which grow on trees, or like cu&s;cuta, dodder, vi&s;cum, mi&s;letoe,
and tilland&s;ia, and epidendrum; and therefore require no cau|dexes
and radicles to pa&s;s down into the ground.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that by rendering it more difficult for
new buds to acquire new caudexes along the branches or trunk
from the &s;ummit into the ground, the tree will be nece&s;&s;itated
to produce flower-buds in preference to leaf-buds; a theory;
which was fir&s;t delivered in the Botanic Garden, Vol. I. canto
4. l. 470, note, and explains the whole art of the management
of fruit-trees.</P>
<P>Vegetables therefore in re&s;pect to their mode of propagation
are either viviparous or oviparous. The live progeny of vege|tables
con&s;i&s;ts of the buds, which ri&s;e on their branches in the
<PB N="358" REF="363">
bo&s;om of each leaf, or on its long caudex extending down the
bark of trees; or which ari&s;e on the bulbs, knobs, wires, or
&s;cions, from the broad caudex on the roots of h$rbaceous
plants. The egg-progeny of vegetables con&s;i&s;ts in their &s;eeds,
with the previous apparatus of the flower, and concomitant nu|triment
in the fruit and cotyledons. And as plants, or parts of
plants are &s;aid to be in greater vigour, when the viviparous pro|geny
is prevalent; as the caudexes of this adherent offspring
form a new bark, and thence thicken and &s;trengthen the trunk
and branches; and to be in le&s;s vigour when the oviparous pro|geny
is prevalent; as the &s;eeds fall from the tree, and con&s;e|quently
require no caudexes to form a new bark, and thence to
thicken and &s;trengthen the tree. We &s;hall generally u&s;e the
word viviparous in&s;tead of vigorous, when applied to vegetables,
which generate leaf-buds principally; and oviparous in&s;tead of
weak, when applied to vegetables, which generate flower-buds
principally; for the words vigorous or weak may properly ex|pre&s;s
the greater or le&s;s health of vegetables in both the&s;e
&s;ituations.</P>
<P>The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that in the Botanic Gar|den
we have called the bark of trees an intertexture of the
roots of each individual bud: but that this is not accurate lan|guage,
as the filaments, which con&s;titute the bark, are each of
them the caudex of a b$d, or central part of it; which has a
leaf at its upper extremity, and a radicle at its lower one. And
that each new caudex, or bark filament, is generated along the
whole trunk of the tree by the caudex or bark filament beneath
it; as appears in tho&s;e fruit-trees where one, or two, or three
&s;cions have been ingrafted on each other, as mentioned in Sect.
VII. 1. 7. for in the&s;e compound tree, when a bud ari&s;es from
any part of the trunk, it is &s;een to re&s;emble that part of the
stock, and not to re&s;emble the new grafted &s;cion above it.
We finally &s;uppo&s;e, that this whole long caudex of a new bud
is generally generated all at the &s;ame time by the &s;ympathetic
action of the parts of the parent caudex along with the bud in
the bo&s;om of the leaf of that parent caudex; and that it is not
gradually produced, as we fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed, by the elongation of
the roots of each budlet in the bo&s;om of the leaves.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="364">
The following methods will contribute to prevent the young
buds from &s;o readily acquiring new caudexes on the trunk of
the tree; and will therefore retard the generation of leaf-buds,
and con&s;equently a&s;&s;i&s;t the generation of fruit-buds; and &s;hould
be executed about Mid&s;ummer, or &s;oon after, as at that time
the new buds are formed.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The fir&s;t method con&s;i&s;ts in bending the viviparous branches
to the horizon, which converts them into oviparous ones,</HI> for by
the curvature of &s;uch branches the bark will be compre&s;&s;ed on
the under &s;ide, and extended on the upper &s;ide of the curve,
and its ve&s;&s;els on both &s;ides will be contracted in their diameters,
and thus the difficulty of producing new caudexes for the gene|ration
of embryon leaf-buds will be increa&s;ed&punc; in whatever &s;tate
of miniature they may be conceived to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>A curious fact &s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the experiments of
Dr. Walker in the fir&s;t volume of the Edinburgh Tran&s;actions,
which &s;hews, that the bending of a branch even below its in|&s;ertion
into the trunk does not impede the a&s;cent, or derivation
of the vernal &s;ap-juice into it; but on the contrary, that it ra|ther
appears to a&s;&s;i&s;t it, re&s;embling in &s;ome mea&s;ure a capillary
&s;yphon, as mentioned in Sect. III. 2. 4. which may be owing
to the vernal &s;ap-juice a&s;cending principally, or entirely, in the
&s;ap-wood, as appears by the new leaves expanding to a certain
degree on decorticated oak-trees, as &s;hewn in Sect. IX. 2. 8.
And as the ve&s;&s;els of this alburnum are more rigid, they may
be le&s;s liable to contraction or coarctation by bending down the
branch than the bark-ve&s;&s;els, as well as from their being placed
within the latter, and therefore le&s;s liable to compre&s;&s;ion beneath
the curvature, and to elongation above it.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that the bending down a branch of a
fruit-tree below the horizon does not dimini&s;h the nutriment of
the fruit-buds, but rather increa&s;es it; as Dr. Walker ob&s;erved
the&s;e buds to grow &s;ooner and larger at the extremities of the
bended branches than on other parts of equal height.</P>
<P>It was a&s;&s;erted by Mr. Lawrence, that the more the branches
of any tree are carried horizontally, the more apt that tree is
to bear fruit; and that the more upright or perpendicular the
branches are led, the more di&s;po&s;ed is that tree to increa&s;e in
<PB N="360" REF="365">
wood; which he a&s;cribes to the bending down of the branches
impeding the circulation of the &s;ap. Art of Gardening. Mr.
Hitt in his Treati&s;e on Fruit Trees, affirms, that if a vigorous
branch of a wall-tree be bent down to the horizon or beneath
it, it lo&s;es its vigour, and becomes a bearing branch; and there|fore
recommends his method of nailing the branches of wall-trees,
and of tying tho&s;e of e&s;paliers, in an horizontal direc|tion
or &s;till lower; as in this con&s;trained &s;ituation there mu&s;t
occur greater difficulty, I &s;uppo&s;e, in the production of the
new caudexes, nece&s;&s;ary for the embryon progeny of buds, up|wards
or horizontally along the bended branch contrary to their
natural habits, as well as from the compre&s;&s;ion of the bark be|neath
the curvature of the branch, and its exten&s;ion above it;
whence more flower-&s;hoots are produced, which do not require
new caudexes to pa&s;s along the bended branch; but which per|mit
their progeny, the &s;eeds, to fall upon the earth, and pene|trate
it with their new roots.</P>
<P>In Lord Stafford's gardens at Trentham I remember to have
&s;een many years ago &s;ome &s;tandard dwarf apple-trees with all
their branches bent down, and fixed on a &s;light frame-work
about a foot from the ground; which &s;eemed to be uncommonly
prolific, as a circle of white and purple flowers twenty feet in
diameter on branches radiated from a center, appeared to a di&s;|tant
eye like a lunar halo, or a carpet of rich embroidery.</P>
<P>The greater production of fruit-buds on branches bended to
the horizon mu&s;t contribute, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, to the prolific
effect of training nectarine and peach-trees on tiles laid on the
ground, or on the gentle de$livity of a bank of earth facing the
&s;outh, which has lately been recommended by &s;ome one, who&s;e
name I do not recollect, who gained a patent for his di&s;covery.
And it is indeed probable, that both the&s;e modes of training
fruit-trees, one of which may be called an horizontal wall-tree,
and the other an horizontal e&s;pa$$er, would repay the labour of
the horticultor; as they would be expo&s;ed to a more vertical
&s;un in &s;ummer, which might more certainly ripen their fruit;
and would be kept &s;omewhat backwarder in the early &s;pring,
by the greater obliquity of the &s;un-beams, and might be there|fore
le&s;s liable to injury from the vernal fro&s;t; and when in
<PB N="361" REF="366">
blo&s;&s;om might ea&s;ily be covered in the night, when nece&s;&s;ary,
by mats thrown over them &s;upported by &s;takes with horizontal poles on them.</P>
<P>2. Secondly. <HI>The twi&s;ting a wire, or tying a waxed &s;tring
round the viviparous branches of a tree, induces them to become
oviparous,</HI> as ob&s;erved by Mr. Whitmill, who bound not only
the viviparous &s;hoots of various wall-trees with &s;trong wire, but
al&s;o &s;ome of their large roots, and thus increa&s;ed the product
of his fruit. Bradley on Gardening, Vol II. p. 155. And
M. Buffon produced the &s;ame effect by a tight cord round the
branches, which previou&s;ly produced leaf-buds in&s;tead of flower-buds.
Act. Paris. ann. 1738.</P>
<P>M. Buffon concludes from the above experiments, that an
ingrafted branch bears fruit more copiou&s;ly, and more certainly,
from its ve&s;&s;els being compre&s;&s;ed by the callus around the ingraft|ed
junction, which may have this effect, and at the &s;ame time
contribute by preventing the luxuriant growth of its leaf &s;hoots
to render the tree of more dwar$i&s;h &s;tature. I am informed
that many dwarf apple-trees, which are now planted in garden
pots both in France and England, bear much fruit, and are
elegantly placed in the centre of a de&s;ert at luxurious tables;
and that the principal art of producing them con&s;i&s;ts in ingraft|ing
them three or four times, &s;cion on &s;cion; &s;o that the &s;tem is
compre&s;&s;ed by the callus of three or four ingraftments before the
branches are permitted to divaricate; and the trees are thus
rendered beautiful dwarfs.</P>
<P>The effect of thus compre&s;&s;ing the bark by a wire, or a cord,
or by the callus round the junctures of the ingrafted &s;cions, is
undoubtedly accompli&s;hed by the increa&s;ed difficulty oppo&s;ed to
the production of the caudexes for each new embryon leaf-bud,
as above explained, and the con&s;equent generation of flower-buds
in&s;tead of them.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Thirdly.</HI> The wounding, or breaking a viviparous branch,
or cutting away a ring of the bark, as of pear-trees, or a &s;emi-cylinder
of the bark of other fruit-trees, induces them to become
oviparous.</P>
<P>Where young trees di&s;cover too great vigour, Mr. Lawrence
advi&s;es to cut the mo&s;t vigorous &s;hoots two parts in three
<PB N="362" REF="367">
through, leaving a large notch, that the wound may not heal
too &s;oon; which he adds will both render them fruitful, make
them more readily conform to the wall or e&s;palier, and pre&s;erve
&s;uch as are dwarfs from too much a&s;piring in very &s;trong
branches, e&s;pecially of pears; he recommends two or more
&s;uch inci&s;ions to be made in the &s;ame branch.</P>
<P>Another method he propo&s;es is to break the too vigorous
branches half through with the hand, which he has practi&s;ed
with &s;ucce&s;s in apricot$ and peaches, when the branches were
formed directly forward from the wall, and the&s;e branches have
continued &s;everal years to bear fruit, though &s;ome have occa|&s;ionally
died by effu&s;ing gum; and though the&s;e inci&s;ions and
breaking the branches may be performed at any time of the
year, he prefers the &s;pring on account of the wet or fro&s;t of
winter. Art of Gardening.</P>
<P>A complete cylinder of the bark about an inch in height was
cut off from the branch of a pear-tree again&s;t a wal$ in Mr.
Howard's garden at Lichfield about five years ago; the circum|ci&s;ed
part is now not above half the diameter of the branch
above and below it, yet this branch has been full of fruit every
year &s;ince, when the other branches of the tree bore only &s;par|ingly.
I lately ob&s;erved, that the leaves of this wounded
branch were &s;maller and paler, and the fruit le&s;s in &s;ize, and
ripened &s;ooner than on the other parts of the tree; and another
branch has the bark taken off not quite all round with much
the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>The theory of this curious vegetable fact receives great light
from the foregoing account of the individuality of buds. A
flower-bud dies when it has perfected its &s;eed, like an annual
plant, and hence requires no place on the bark for new caudexes
to pa&s;s downwards; but on the contrary leaf-buds, as they ad|vance
into &s;hoots, form new buds in the axilla of every leaf;
which new buds require new caudexes to pa&s;s down the bark,
and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch. Now if a cy|linder
of the bark be de&s;troyed, many of the&s;e new caudexes
cannot be produced; and thence more of the buds will be con|verted
into flower-buds.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="368">
In this curious circum&s;tance the caudexes of the buds of the
tree above the decorticated part &s;eem to have emitted &s;hort ra|dicles
into the alburnum; the ve&s;&s;els of which mu&s;t thus have
acted as capillary tubes between the upper and lower caudexes
of tho&s;e buds; as capillary tubes will rai&s;e water by the attrac|tion
of their internal &s;urfaces nearly to their &s;ummits, when
they are not too high in proportion to their diameter; but water
will in no ca&s;e flow over their &s;ummits, but will always &s;tand
with a concave &s;urface below the uppermo&s;t rim of the tube, in
which &s;ituation it may readily be ab&s;orbed by vegetable radi|cles;
and may be &s;upplied from beneath by the &s;ap-juice rai&s;ed
by the vegetable action of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the caudexes,
who&s;e radicles terminate in the earth.</P>
<P>It is cu&s;tomary to debark oak trees in the &s;pring, which are
intended to be felled in the en&s;uing autumn; becau&s;e the bark
comes off ea&s;ier at this &s;ea&s;on; and the &s;ap-wood, or alburnum,
is believed to become harder, and more durable, if the tree
remains till the end of &s;ummer. The trees thus &s;tripped of
their bark put forth &s;hoots as u&s;ual with acorns on the &s;ixth,
&s;eventh, and eighth joints, like vines; but in the branches I
examined the joints of the debarked trees were much &s;horter
than tho&s;e of other oak-trees, the acorns were more numerous,
and no new buds were produced above the joints which bore
acorns. From hence it appears, that the branches of decorti|cated
oak-trees produce fewer leaf-buds, and more flower-buds.
And &s;econdly, that the new buds of debarked oak trees con|tinue
to obtain moi&s;ture from the alburnum after the &s;ea&s;on of
the a&s;cent of the &s;ap in other vegetables cea&s;es; which in this
unnatural &s;tate of the debarked tree may act as capillary tubes,
like the alburnum of the &s;mall debarked cylinder of a pear-tree
above mentioned; or as the ve&s;&s;els of the alburnum may not
yet have lo&s;t their vegetable life, they may continue to ab&s;orb
&s;ap-juice or water from their radicles, and carry it to the buds
at the &s;ummits by their &s;piral contractions as in the bleeding
&s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is probable, that if oaks were debarked in the &s;ummer,
that much fewer leaf-buds would appear amid&s;t the flower-buds;
becau&s;e many of the latter mu&s;t be advanced too far, when the
<PB N="364" REF="369">
trees are debarked in the &s;pring, to be converted into flower-buds
by preventing the production of their caudexes, or by im|peding
the a&s;cent of the nutritive &s;ap-juice; which in the&s;e
trees is lodged principally I &s;uppo&s;e in the alburnum, as
&s;poken of in Sect. IX. 2. 8. On the &s;ame account, when
much &s;ap-juice is taken in the vernal months from the birch or
maple for the purpo&s;es of making wine in this country, or &s;ugar
in America, I am informed, that no great difference occurs in
the re&s;pective numbers of flower-buds or leaf-buds which then
&s;ucceed; but that the general luxuriance of the tree is dimi|ni&s;hed;
which evinces, that for the de&s;ign of generating more
flower-buds and fewer leaf-buds by partial decortication, it
&s;hould be performed about Mid&s;ummer.</P>
<P>The cylindrical or &s;emicylindrical decortication of a large
root of a tree, as well as of a branch, is &s;aid to an&s;wer the
purpo&s;e of increa&s;ing the production of fruit-buds by le&s;&s;ening
the number of leaf-buds; but may be &s;ubject to two inconve|niencies;
fir&s;t, that the wounded root being near the &s;urface of
the ground may be liable to rot like the bottoms of hedge-&s;takes;
or like timber, which is kept in moi&s;t cellars; or the
po&s;ts of wooden bridges, which are alternately expo&s;ed to wa|ter
and to air. A &s;econd inconvenience may occur from ter|re&s;trial
in&s;ects having acce&s;s to the alburnum of the root, which
is often full of &s;weet &s;ap-juice to invite them, and is otherwi&s;e
generally defended by an acrid rind.</P>
<P>The parts of a tree immediately below a decorticated or a
&s;trangulated branch or root will generally become viviparous,
and will thence be &s;aid to be increa&s;ed in vigour; that is, it will
produce new leaf-buds, and tho&s;e of a luxuriant appearance;
becau&s;e the injury of the bark of the branch or root will pre|vent
the parts above from receiving &s;o much of the nutritive
&s;ap-juice, as in their &s;ound &s;tate; and con&s;equently the parts
beneath will po&s;&s;e&s;s more of it; and al&s;o becau&s;e the&s;e new buds
are generated from a lower part of the caudex, and will thence
be a few years before they will acquire that maturity, or puberty,
which is nece&s;&s;ary for the generation of flower-buds, or the
production of a &s;exual or &s;eminal progeny; whence by &s;trangu|lating
or decorticating the alternate branches of a pear-tree they
<PB N="365" REF="370">
will bear for &s;ix or eight years; and the other alternate ones will
become in the &s;ame time &s;trong and vigorous, ready to undergo
a &s;imilar operation, when the former cea&s;e to be of further u&s;e;
but the fruit will become &s;maller in &s;ize, though in greater num|ber,
and ripen earlier in the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner new root-&s;cions are &s;aid to be produced
by &s;trangulating a branch of a root near the &s;urface with a tight
&s;tring, or by &s;litting a root near the trunk, Evelyn's Sylva; as
in the&s;e ca&s;es the a&s;cent of the &s;ap-juice is impeded, and the
part below becomes viviparous, or produces new leaf-buds for
the rea&s;ons mentioned in the la&s;t paragraph; as is frequently
&s;een where the end of a branch is lopped, or beneath the &s;car of
the junction of an ingrafted &s;cion. On the &s;ame account it is
not uncommon to ingraft with &s;ucce&s;s on roots taken out of the
ground, and afterwards replanted; as the robinia on the root
of acacia, and any other apples on the roots of the &s;uckers of
bur-apple, or codling, mentioned in Sect. IX. 3. 5.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on the roots of &s;ome plants, which are other|wi&s;e
not ea&s;ily propagated, will &s;hoot up buds; if a part of them
next the &s;tem of the plant be half cut through, or rai&s;ed out of
the ground, and expo&s;ed to the air; as in pyramidal cam|panula,
and geranium lobatum. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on the
lateral branches of numerous &s;hrubs, as well as of herbaceous
plants, will put forth roots, when they are bent down into the
ground, if they are previou&s;ly wounded to prevent the free
&s;upply of the vegetable nutriment in its u&s;ual cour&s;e, as in laying
carnations, dianthus.</P>
<P>A method of converting the viviparous branches of pear and
apple trees into oviparous branches is de&s;cribed by Mr. Fitzger|ald
in the Philo&s;ph. Tran&s;act. Vol. LII. and &s;eems to be &s;upe|rior
to the ex&s;ection of a cylinder of the bark above mentioned;
as the alburnum is not left naked after the operation. In the
month of Augu&s;t he made a circular inci&s;ion round the princi|pal
branches of &s;everal pear-trees, apple-trees, plum-trees, and
cherry-trees, near the &s;tems of each, quite through the bark.
About three or four inches higher he then made another inci&s;ion
round the bark, and then a perpendicular one, joining the&s;e two
circular ones, and &s;eparated the cylinder of bark nicely from the
<PB N="366" REF="371">
wood, covering it, and the bare part of the wood, from the air
for about a quarter of an hour, when the wound began to bleed.
He then replaced the bark with great exactne&s;s, and bound
it round rather tightly with ba&s;s, &s;o as to cover the wound en|tirely,
and half an inch above and below the circumci&s;ions.</P>
<P>In about a month the bark began to &s;well above and below
the bandages, he then unbound them, and found the parts
quite healed. He rebound them &s;lightly with ba&s;s, and let them
remain &s;o till the beginning of the next &s;ummer, when he again
took off the bandages, and found them all healthy, and every
one of them bore plentifully that &s;ea&s;on, though it was in general
reckoned a &s;carce fruit year.</P>
<P>He treated two young pear-trees in this manner, which never
had yet had any bloom; on one of them he operated on the main
arms, and on &s;everal of the le&s;s branches from tho&s;e main arms;
and on only one of the main arms of the other. The fir&s;t, he
&s;ays, bore a &s;urprizing quantity of fruit in the next &s;ummer;
and the circumci&s;ed arm of the other bore a moderate quantity;
though no other part of the tree had any appearance of bloom.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitzgerald afterwards took a cylinder of the bark from
the branches of two young apple trees about the &s;ame &s;ize, as
exactly as he could by mea&s;ure; and changing them, bound
them each on the other tree. The bark of one had a leaf-bud
and two apples growing on it; the barks of both of them healed
perfectly, the leaf-bud put forth leaves, and the apples remained
on and ripened; and both the branches bore &s;o plentifully, that
one broke with its load, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to prop the
other.</P>
<P>The theory of the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e curious experiments con|firms
that delivered above concerning the &s;cars made by the
junction of ingrafted &s;cions with the &s;tocks; and it is probable,
that three or four circular inci&s;ions through the bark on vivipa|rous
pear or apple trees, or a &s;piral inci&s;ion, as de&s;cribed in
Sect. IX. 2. 8. might an&s;wer the purpo&s;e without detracting
and replacing the bark; as &s;cars or callous circles would be thus
produced, which might render it more difficult for the new
caudexes of the embryon leaf-buds to be generated, or their
parts united, and con&s;equently increa&s;e the number of flower-buds.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="372">
Mr. Fitzgerald further ob&s;erves, that he changed cylinders
of the bark with equal &s;ucce&s;s of nectarine and peach trees;
and that the branches thus operated upon were retarded in their
general growth; which coincides with the idea of repeatedly
grafting one &s;cion above another on the apple-trees de&s;igned for
dwarfs to be &s;et in garden pots, as de&s;cribed in No. 2. 2. of
this Section.</P>
<P>4. The tran&s;planting a viviparous fruit-tree, or de&s;troying &s;ome
of its roots before Mid&s;ummer, or the confining its roots in a garden
pot, or on a floor of bricks beneath the &s;oil, will induce it to become
oviparous.</P>
<P>Mr. Knight, in his treati&s;e on the Culture of the Apple and
Pear, p. 83, has the following pa&s;&s;age. &startq;In the garden cul|ture
of the apple, where the trees are retained as dwarfs or e&s;pa|liers,
the more vigorou&s;ly growing kinds are often rendered un|productive
by the exce&s;&s;ive, though nece&s;&s;ary, u&s;e of the prun|ing
knife. I have always &s;ucceeded in making trees of this
kind fruitful by digging them up, and replacing them with &s;ome
fre&s;h mould in the &s;ame &s;ituation. The too great luxuriance of
growth is checked, and a di&s;po&s;ition to bear is in con&s;equence
brought on.&endq; The &s;ame ob&s;ervation was made by Mr. Law|rence,
who took up trees which were too vigorous; that is,
which produced viviparous buds in&s;tead of oviparous ones, and
replanted them to render them fruitful. Art of Gardening.
Lond. 1723.</P>
<P>In tran&s;planting trees for any purpo&s;e it may be ob&s;erved,
that they &s;hould not be replanted deep in the &s;oil, &s;ince the
mo&s;t nutritive or &s;alubrious parts of the earth are tho&s;e within
the reach of the &s;un's warmth, of the de&s;cending moi&s;ture, and
of the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere. And as the root-fibres of trees, like tho&s;e of &s;eeds, always grow towards the moi&s;te&s;t part
of the &s;oil, as the young &s;hoots and leaves grow towards the
pure&s;t air and brighte&s;t light; it follows, that the root-fibres
&s;eldom ri&s;e higher in the ground than they were originally &s;et,
and &s;eldom elongate them&s;elves even perfectly horizontally; &s;o
that when a fruit-tree is planted too deep in the earth, it &s;eldom
grows with healthy vigour, either in re&s;pect to its leaf-buds or
its flower-buds.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="373">
This curious effect cannot be produced by generally debilitat|ing
the tree from its want of due nouri&s;hment; becau&s;e it is &s;aid
to &s;ucceed be&s;t in very good &s;oil, or by the addition of new
garden mould, as before directed; but by rendering more dif|ficult
the production of radicles from the caudexes of the em|bryon
leaf-buds; which de&s;cend to the &s;ine&s;t ramifications of
the old roots, and elongate them&s;elves beyond the extremities
of their ultimate fibrils; a great number of which roots being
torn off by tran&s;plantation, or compre&s;&s;ed in a garden pot, the
production or progre&s;s of many of the new radicles mu&s;t be im|peded
or prevented; and the numerous caudexes of new leaf-buds
be in con&s;equence formed with greater difficulty, whence
an increa&s;ed tendency to generate flower-buds.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on if beans, vicia faba, which are but a few
inches high, be tran&s;planted; they do not become &s;o tall, but
they flower and ripen their &s;eeds &s;ooner; becau&s;e they can not
&s;o ea&s;ily generate new leaf-buds. The &s;ame occurs in frequent|ly
tran&s;planting brocoli, bra&s;&s;ica; the plant does not grow &s;o
tall, but has earlier flowers, and in greater number; and it is
hence better to pluck them up, than to dig them up, for the pur|po&s;e
of replanting them; as by that means more of the root-fibres
are torn off, and the plants become almost totally oviparous.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the ve&s;&s;els of animal bodies are le&s;s
liable to bleed, when they are torn a&s;under, than when they are
cut with a &s;harp in&s;trument; as their diameters are contracted,
or their internal &s;urfaces brought into contact with each other,
in the act of extending them, till they break. Thus if the
navel-&s;trings of new born animals are cut in&s;tead of torn, they
are liable to bleed to death; and there is a remarkable ca&s;e of
a miller's &s;ervant, who had his arm and &s;houlder bone, or &s;ca$pula,
torn off in a windmill without much lo&s;s of blood. This
is mentioned to &s;hew, that it may al&s;o be better to tear up roots,
which are tran&s;planted for this purpo&s;e, than to dig them up;
is they may thence effu&s;e le&s;s vegetable blood, and in con&s;e|quence
be le&s;s weakened by the operation.</P>
<P>In tran&s;planting &s;trawberries many of the roots being torn off,
fewer leaf-buds, and con&s;equent wires, are produced from the
difficulty, which their embryon caudexes find in producing new
<PB N="369" REF="374">
radicles over the old ones to &s;upply nutriment to the wires, till
they bend down and protrude roots into the ground at their
other extremities, whence a greater number of flower-buds are
generated; on this account the roots of &s;trawberries &s;hould ge|nerally
be tran&s;planted, or new ones from the wires &s;hould be
cultivated, every third or fourth year, to prevent the too luxu|riant
growth of their wires; or a &s;imilar difficulty of producing
wires or leaf-buds may be effected by crowding the roots of
&s;trawberries together, as &s;ome gardeners recommend; but I
&s;uppo&s;e by the&s;e means the fruit may become &s;maller from &s;car|city
of nutriment, though more numerous.</P>
<P>A floor of bricks, or of &s;tone, extended about two feet deep
beneath the roots of wall trees, has been practi&s;ed in &s;ome
gardens from an idea, that the roots &s;hot them&s;elves too deep
into &s;ome unwhole&s;ome &s;tratum of earth; and it has been ob|&s;erved,
that the trees became better fruit-bearers. In &s;ome
&s;ituations it is po&s;&s;ible, this might be the cau&s;e of the new pro|lific
property of the trees; but I &s;u&s;pect it has occurred gene|rally
from the difficulty oppo&s;ed to the number and elongation
of the root-fibres, and con&s;equently to the generation of the
new caudexes of the embryon leaf-buds; whence a greater pro|duction
of flower-buds en&s;ued.</P>
<P>In &s;imilar manner it is a&s;&s;erted by one of the Linnean &s;chool
in the Amoenitates Academicae, that &s;ome bulbous rooted
plants, which &s;eldom produce &s;eeds in Sweden, will produce
prolific &s;eeds, if their roots be confined in a garden pot, till
they crowd each other; as tho&s;e of the lily of the valley, con|vallaria.
And that the orchis will bear prolific &s;eeds, if the
new root early in the &s;ea&s;on be &s;evered from the old one, which
has put up the flower-&s;tem. This mu&s;t occur in the former
ca&s;e from the difficulty, which the plants find to generate new
offsets at their roots, which are their viviparous progeny; and
in the latter ca&s;e from the new offset being de&s;troyed; whence
in both &s;ituations more nutriment is expended on the flower.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame account it is probable, that confining the roots
of cucumbers and melons in &s;mall garden pots would &s;top the
too luxuriant growth of their leaf-buds, and render them &s;ooner
oviparous, if care was taken to &s;upply them with water more
<PB N="370" REF="375">
frequently, and with &s;ufficient nutriment by mixing with the
water &s;ome of the carbonic black fluid, which has drained from
a manure heap.</P>
<P>5. <HI>If the central viviparous branches of a plant be cut away
or &s;hortened, the lateral ones will &s;ooner or more completely become
oviparous.</HI> 1. There are many very &s;mall buds on the lower
parts of large branches, which do not &s;eem to grow to matu|rity,
and in con&s;equence produce neither new leaf-buds nor new
flower-buds. There are other lateral &s;hoots on many trees,
which only pu&s;h out a few inches, and are called &s;purs, and
which bear fruit the &s;ucceeding &s;ummer at their extremities.
In many other plants the lateral branches are oviparous, except
at the extremity, which is terminated with a viviparous bud;
while the central branches continue long to generate only a vi|viparous
progeny, as in vines and melons.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, or the unprolific exi&s;tence of the buds at
the bottom of large branches, may be owing in part to their
feebler efforts of pullulation from the want of &s;ufficient &s;un&s;hine
and ventilation; and al&s;o in part, like the &s;purs, and other la|teral
branches, to the difficulty they encounter in producing the
embryon caudexes of new leaf-buds along the trunk; which is
already occupied by tho&s;e of the more vigorous vegetation of the
central branches, which po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater &s;hare of &s;un&s;hine and
ventilation.</P>
<P>But the principal cau&s;e, which renders the &s;purs and lateral
branches oviparous, re&s;ults from the re&s;i&s;tance the embryon
caudexes of leaf-buds experience by the curvature of the lateral
branch, where it joins the trunk, and the con&s;equent coarctation
of its ve&s;&s;els, added to the difficulty every lateral bud has to
encounter from its own curvature at its exit from the parent
twig; on which la&s;t account the central bud at the extremity
of an oviparous branch is generally viviparous, becau&s;e it has not
any curvature at its exit. All this corre&s;ponds with the fact
above de&s;cribed, that when the viviparous arms of wall-trees
are bent down to the horizon, they become oviparous. See
No. 2. 1. of this Section.</P>
<P>2. What then happens in all the&s;e &s;ituations when the central
parts are cut away or &s;hortened? Fir&s;t the dwarf buds at the
<PB N="371" REF="376">
bottom of the&s;e large viviparous branches, which are in part
cut away, will find more room to pu&s;h down the embryon cau|dexes
of new leaf-buds; and will produce a viviparous progeny;
and tho&s;e at the bottom of oviparous branches, which are &s;hor|tened
by cutting off their viviparous extremities, will al&s;o now
pullulate, and produce flower-buds for the &s;ucceeding year,
owing to the derivation of &s;ome of that nouri&s;hment to them,
which would otherwi&s;e have been expended on the &s;ummit-bud.
Secondly, the &s;purs will generate an oviparous progeny, but
will acquire more nutriment, becau&s;e all the ve&s;&s;els of plants in|o&s;culate,
as mentioned in Sect. IX. 2. 10. and will thence pro|duce
larger fruit, and more certainly ripen it. Thirdly, the
other lateral branches will receive more nouri&s;hment, and be|come
more vertical, and will thence find le&s;s oppo&s;ition to the
production of the caudexes, both of their flower-buds and leaf-buds;
either of which may become &s;tronger or more numerous
according to the greater or le&s;s inclination of the branches to the
horizon; and both of them may be more vigorous properly
&s;peaking; that is, they may become larger leaf-buds, or larger
flower-buds, than others of the &s;ame tree.</P>
<P>3. Thus in the management of MELONS, which would grow
into branches much too exten&s;ive for the artificial gla&s;s-frames
of our climate, and would not have time to ripen their later fruit
in our &s;hort &s;ummers; it is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to check the vigour,
properly &s;o &s;peaking, of the whole plant. This is done by wa&s;h|ing
the &s;eed from the ripe fruit, which &s;hould naturally contri|bute
to nouri&s;h it; and by keeping the &s;eed four or five years, that
the mucilaginous nutriment depo&s;ited in the cotyledons may al&s;o
be in &s;ome degree impaired; it is al&s;o probable, that confining
the roots of melons and cucumbers in garden-pots, if they were
well &s;upplied with nutriment, warmth, and water, might be
advantageous for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Secondly, as &s;oon as the leaf appears an inch in diameter, ex|perienced
gardeners pick out the central bud, which cau&s;es an
oviparous, though a more vigorous, lateral &s;hoot; which there|fore
&s;ooner bears fruit, and that of a larger kind; as it acquires
more nouri&s;hment from the de&s;truction of the central one.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="377">
And as the&s;e lateral branches are liable to produce other
viviparous &s;hoots at their extremities, after they have generated
lateral flower-buds, it again becomes nece&s;&s;ary to pinch off the
viviparous extremities of them, not only to accommodate them
to the &s;ize of the gla&s;s-frame, but al&s;o to &s;upply them with more
nutriment, which would otherwi&s;e have been expended on the
viviparous &s;ummit.</P>
<P>The central bud, or &s;ummit, of the lateral branches, is ge|nerally
viviparous, as well as of the central branches; becau&s;e
the embryon caudexes of its new offspring are oppo&s;ed in the
production along the bark by only one curvature at the in&s;ertion
of the branch into the trunk; whereas the lateral buds of the
lateral branches have the progre&s;s of the embryon caudexes of
their new buds oppo&s;ed by two curvatures, one of the bud to
the branch, and another from the branch to the trunk.</P>
<P>The is another rea&s;on, why the lateral buds of many plants
produce flowers &s;ooner than the &s;ummit; which is, that the
lateral buds of tho&s;e plants, where the pith of the upright cen|tral
&s;hoot is not divided, are propagated from the central &s;hoot,
and are therefore one generation older; and have thus acquir|ed
the maturity nece&s;&s;ary for amatorial reproduction. In other
plants, where the pith of the &s;tem is divided at every joint, the
&s;ummit bud has been preceded by more generations, and is
therefore more mature for the purpo&s;e of producing flowers,
that the lateral ones, as in a &s;tem of wheat; and probably in
the artichoke, and on the &s;purs of &s;ome fruit trees, as of
pears.</P>
<P>4. It was ob&s;erved in Sect. IX. 3. 1. that in the &s;tems of
wheat three or four joints are formed above each other previous
to that, which bears the ear; and that in many other annual or
biennial plants two or three viviparous lateral &s;hoots occur, as
in artichoke, cinara; and &s;al&s;afi, tragopogon, before the cen|tral
one flowers. The &s;ame happens to the vine-&s;hoots; two
or three joints with a leaf and a viviparous bud at each are
always fir&s;t produced; and as each of the&s;e have a divi&s;ion of
the pith between every joint, as remarked in Sect. I. 8. I
&s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e joints are &s;eparate plants growing on each
other like the joints of the &s;tem of wheat; and that hence in
<PB N="373" REF="378">
vine-&s;hoots three or four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations of leaf-&s;hoots mu&s;t
exi&s;t, before the new &s;hoot can attain &s;ufficient maturity to form
a flower; as the amatorial generation of &s;eeds was &s;hewn to re|quire
higher animation, if it may be &s;o called, than the lateral
generation of leaf-buds. The &s;ame mode of growth occurs in
the young &s;hoots of oaks, and which is thus curiou&s;ly accounted
for.</P>
<P>The lateral branches of many mature trees, though they bear
flower-buds on their &s;ides, are generally terminated with a leaf-bud,
as above explained; but it happens in &s;ome of them, and
particularly to vines, that after two or three flower-buds are
produced on a lateral branch, that it &s;hall proceed to grow in
length, and to produce leaf-buds at every joint above the flower-buds,
as well as at the &s;ummit; which may be thus perhaps &s;a|tisfactorily
explained. After the third, and fourth, and fifth
joints of a new lateral &s;hoot have generated flowers, which re|quire
few or no more caudexes; room enough is left on the
bark of the &s;hoot for tho&s;e above them to acquire the numerous
new miniature caudexes of embryon leaf-buds, and where the
new caudexes of embryon buds can ea&s;ily be produced along
the bark, and &s;ufficient nutriment is &s;upplied; all vegetables are
more liable to propagate them&s;elves by buds than by &s;eeds.</P>
<P>Hence in the management of VINES, as well as of MELONS,
it is u&s;eful at two or three joints above the la&s;t bunch of fruit
to pinch off the viviparous end of the new branch, not &s;o much
to accommodate the length of it to the hou&s;e, as to &s;upply the
growing fruit with more nouri&s;hment from the ino&s;culations of
the ve&s;&s;els of the caudexes of the&s;e viviparous buds, which are
now cut off, with tho&s;e of the oviparous ones, which remain.</P>
<P>A curious vegetable fact, which appears in the culture of
VINES in hot-hou&s;es here pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our notice. When a
vigorous &s;hoot advances without producing fruit-buds at the third
or fourth joint, it is frequently permitted to grow in length to
above twenty feet; but at every joint the new or &s;econdary bud
is pinched off, either &s;oon after its appearance, or after it has
&s;hot out one or two joints. By this management of permitting
the central &s;ummit of the &s;hoot to grow till Augu&s;t or Sep|tember,
the eyes, who&s;e buds have been pinched off, do not
<PB N="374" REF="379">
put out afre&s;h during that &s;ummer; but new buds are formed
at each eye, which germinate the next &s;ummer, and almo&s;t all
of them produce fruit.</P>
<P>If however &s;ome of the &s;hoots in the bo&s;om of the&s;e leaves
are pinched off too &s;oon after their appearance, they are occa|&s;ionally
liable to generate new leaf-buds, which &s;hoot out afre&s;h
from the &s;ame eye; and it is &s;aid, that the&s;e eyes, which have
thus produced two leaf-buds in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in one &s;ummer, will
not generally produce buds of any kind in the &s;ucceeding &s;um|mer;
for as &s;everal of the&s;e joints in vigorous vines bear two or
three buds from the &s;ame eye at the &s;ame time, &s;o others bear
them in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The theory of the&s;e important facts may not be ea&s;y to inve&s;|tigate;
it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, that pinching off the lateral
&s;hoots at every bud of a new vine-branch &s;trengthens the next
year's expected bud, by not expending &s;o much nutritive juice;
and that giving the vines a fortnight's artificial heat, after the
&s;ummer heat le&s;&s;ens, ripens the wood for the production of the
next year's fruit; but the&s;e are words, I imagine, without ac|curate
ideas. I &s;uppo&s;e, when each lateral &s;hoot of this year's
branch of a vine is pinched off, that its caudexes, which had
already formed a part of the bark, coale&s;ce; and may thus ren|der
it more difficult for the caudexes of the &s;ucceeding embryon
bud in the &s;ame eye, which is to be expanded next &s;pring, to
be produced along the bark, by having previou&s;ly occupied the
&s;ituation which tho&s;e new caudexes would require; and that
thus the &s;econdary buds of the&s;e eyes become flower-buds, which
might otherwi&s;e have been leaf-buds.</P>
<P>The continued heat a week or two above the u&s;ual time of
&s;ummer, which is &s;aid to ripen the wood, may contribute to
dry and harden it, as well as to forward the growth of the buds;
and thus both to render the protru&s;ion of embryon roots more
difficult, and con&s;equently to produce flower-buds, and tho&s;e of
a larger kind.</P>
<P>Whether a &s;imilar method to this practi&s;ed on vines could be
applied with advantage in the management of other fruit-trees
is a circum&s;tance of great importance, and can only be deter|mined
by experiment. But as the fir&s;t foliage of euonymus is
<PB N="375" REF="380">
generally de&s;troyed by in&s;ects in this country, and yet a &s;econd
growth of foliage is produced; and as I witne&s;&s;ed la&s;t year,
that the whole fir&s;t leaves of an apple-tree were de&s;troyed, as
was believed, by lightning, and which yet put forth an entire
new &s;et of leaves in a few weeks; is there not rea&s;on to con|clude,
that if the leaf-buds were picked out early in the &s;ea&s;on
from a &s;trong &s;hoot of peach or apricot, either new leaf-buds
might be produced in that &s;ummer, or flower-buds in the &s;uc|ceding
one, as happens to the vine-&s;hoots above de&s;cribed; and
that our wall-trees might be thus rendered more certainly proli|fic.
And la&s;tly, might not the clipping out with fine &s;ci&s;&s;ars
the extremities of young vine-&s;hoots, which would otherwi&s;e be
barren ones, convert, &s;ome of their tendrils into bunches by
thus &s;upplying them with additional nutriment, by preventing
its expenditure in the elongation of the viviparous branch? This
experiment might be the more readily tried, as &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that
the barren buds may be di&s;tinguished from the prolific ones by
their form before they expand.</P>

<HEAD>III. TO PERFECT AND ENLARGE THE FRUIT.</HEAD>
<P>It is believed by &s;ome of the Linnean &s;chool, that flower-buds
or leaf-buds may be converted into each other in the early &s;tate
of their exi&s;tence, as mentioned in Sect. IX. 2. 8. It is indeed
probable, that either a flower-bud or leaf-bud may be generated
in&s;tead of each other reciprocally, before either of them exi&s;ts;
but after either of them has obtained a certain degree of maturity,
&s;o as to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by its form being more pointed or more
&s;pherical; I &s;u&s;pect no addition or detraction of nutriment, or
of the facility of the production of its embryon caudexes down
the bark and radicles beneath can change its de&s;tination.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Shorten the oviparous branches, when the leaves fall off, by
pruning their viviparous &s;ummits, and cut away the root-&s;uckers.</HI>
The &s;ummits of the lateral branches, as well as the erect ones,
are furni&s;hed generally with viviparous buds; which in many
wall trees &s;hould be cut off, after the leaves fall in autumn;
that more nutriment may be derived to the fruit-buds, which
may occa&s;ionally become &s;omewhat enlarged during the milder
days of winter; as they are now certainly too far advanced to
be changed into leaf-buds; and if this pruning be deferred till
late in the winter months, the flower-buds will not be quite &s;o
forward, as if it be performed earlier. For the &s;ame reason the
root-&s;uckers al&s;o &s;hould be cut away in the autumn, that all the
nutriment, which they would otherwi&s;e expend, may be derived
to the flower-buds, and induce them early to enlarge them|selves.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Pinch or rub off all u&s;ele&s;s viviparous buds in the &s;pring or
&s;ummer, as they occur.</HI> In tho&s;e trees where the fruit-buds ari&s;e
on the new leaf-&s;hoots along with the leaf-buds, and cannot
therefore be &s;ooner di&s;tingui&s;hed or approached, as in figs and
vines; the &s;ummit leaf-buds &s;hould be pinched off two joints abovet
the fruit-buds, as &s;oon as they appear, that more nutriment may
be conveyed to the fruit-buds. See No. 3. 4. of this Section.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="382">
And in the hardier wall-trees the new leaf-buds, which appear
during the &s;pring and &s;ummer months in wrong places, where
they cannot be trained properly again&s;t the wall, or where they
are too numerous, &s;hould be rubbed or pinched off, as they oc|cur;
whence more nouri&s;hment will be derived to the ripening
fruit, and to tho&s;e new leaf-buds which are to remain to produce
future flower-buds.</P>
<P>And if the new buds, which are &s;een in their young &s;tate in
the axilla of the leaves of the new &s;hoots, were picked out by
the point of a knife, or pinched off, where they grow long
enough for that purpo&s;e as the &s;econdary &s;hoots of vines in
grape hou&s;es are pinched; it might probably induce tho&s;e eyes
to produce flowers in the &s;ucceeding year, as &s;poken of in No.
2. 5. of this Section, as well as contribute to enlarge the pre|&s;ent
fruit by the expenditure of less nutriment on the leaf-buds,
an idea well deserving the te&s;t of experiment.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner in the cultivation of melons and cucum|bers
after the central bud is pinched off, as mentioned above No.
2. 5. the viviparous extremities of the lateral branches &s;hould
be al&s;o de&s;troyed, as &s;oon as a &s;ufficient number of female flowers
are impregnated; that a greater &s;hare of nutriment may be
de|rived
to them, in&s;tead of crowding the frame with new branches,
who&s;e fruit-buds would be too late to ripen in our &s;hort &s;um|mers.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Thin all tho&s;e fruits, which are too numerous; pluck off
apricots, peaches, goo&s;eberries; and cut out many grapes from each
branch with &s;ci&s;&s;ars.</HI> By the ino&s;culation of the ve&s;&s;els of vege|tables
mentioned in Sect. I. 3. when any parts of a tree are
de&s;troyed, tho&s;e in their vicinity become more vigorous. On
this account when part of the fruit is taken away as early as may
be, the remaining part acquires more nutriment. Add to this,
that, where the fruit is crowded, &s;ome of it becomes precluded
from the &s;un and air, and in con&s;equence does not perfectly
ripen, and is liable to become mouldy; for mucor is a vegeta|ble
production, which like other fungi does not require either
much light or air, as appears from the growth of &s;ome fungu&s;|&s;es
in dark cellars, and of common mu&s;hrooms beneath beds of
&s;traw, as mentioned in Sect. XIII. 1. 4.</P>
<Q><PB N="378" REF="383">
4. Prevent the production of new leaf-buds.</Q>
<P>In &s;ome pear trees the whole of the blo&s;&s;oms become &s;terile,
and fall off without any apparent injury from cold, and this for
many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years. The &s;ame occurs &s;ometimes to che&s;nut
trees, ae&s;culus pavia, after the flower the fructification entirely
falls off; &s;ome of the&s;e might be male flowers, as Miller ob|serves,
but the whole could not be &s;uch. The &s;ame happens
very frequently to the fig-trees of this climate, &s;ometimes the
whole crop falls off, when they are about the &s;ize of filberts;
that is, while they are &s;till in flower, which though concealed
within the fig, mu&s;t precede the &s;welling of the &s;eeds, whether
the&s;e be impregnated or not.</P>
<P>A corre&s;pondent fact occurred to me a few years ago. I had
&s;ix young trees of the I&s;chia fig with fruit on them in pots in a
&s;tove. On removing them into larger boxes the figs fell off,
which I a&s;cribed to the increa&s;ed vigour of the plants; as they
protruded very vigorous &s;hoots occa&s;ioned by the accumulation
of new &s;oil round their roots. Perhaps the&s;e plants might rather
be &s;aid to have been in flower than in fruit, and perhaps the&s;e
flowers were all male ones only, or accompanied only with im|perfect
female ones?</P>
<P>Whence I conclude, that about the &s;ea&s;on when the corals
of the&s;e flowers with their &s;tamens and &s;tigmas die, the trees
generate and nouri&s;h too many new leaf-buds, owing to the faci|lity
with which they can produce the new caudexes of the&s;e
young buds down the bark; and that by the whole of the vege|table
&s;ap-juice being derived to the new buds for their pre&s;ent
growth, or to form re&s;ervoirs for their future growth, the peri|carp
and &s;eeds, whether impregnated or not, are deprived of
their due nutriment and fall off. See Sect. XVI. 1. 4.</P>
<P>Hence I propo&s;e to tie waxed thread or fine wire round the
twigs of pear-trees, which have u&s;ually mi&s;carried, as
&s;oon as they are in flower, &s;o as to compre&s;s, but not &s;o as to &s;trangu|late
them; or to wound the bark by a circular or &s;emicircular
inci&s;ion, which might counteract their facility of procreating
new leaf-buds; which I &s;u&s;pect would be more effectual in pre|venting
the flowers from falling off, than pinching off the new
<PB N="379" REF="384">
leaf-buds, as they appear; which is recommended by Dr. Brad|ley
in the management of fig-trees, and is done to vines in hot-hou&s;es;
but which I found to be ineffectual on many fig-branches
both in the natural ground and in pots, and a&s;cribed its failure
to the continuance of the efforts of the fig-tree to produce new
leaf-buds; whereas in vines, I &s;uppo&s;e, the grapes would ripen,
whether the new leaf-buds remain or are de&s;troyed. See No.
3. 2. of this Section.</P>
<P>Pontedera ob&s;erved, that in the i&s;lands of the Archipelago
&s;ome fig-trees bear in the &s;pring many male flowers, and few
female ones, the former of which fall off; and that they bear
a &s;econd crop chiefly of female flowers in the autumn, which
ripen in the ensuing &s;pring. Anthologia. Can this occur in the
fig-trees of this country?</P>
<P>Other figs are &s;aid not to ripen but to fall off before their
maturity, unle&s;s they be wounded by in&s;ects in their caprifica|tion,
or punctured by a &s;traw. A further inve&s;tigation of this
&s;ubject is much wanted to propagate figs with &s;ucce&s;s in this
climate. See Botanic Garden, Vol. II. note on caprificus.
See al&s;o Milne's Botan. Diction. Article caprification.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Give additional moi&s;ture, manure, and warmth during the
early part of the growth of fruit.</HI> By additional moi&s;ture the
fruit becomes larger; in hot-hou&s;es this may be effected two
ways, one by watering the earth on which the vegetables grow,
and another by producing &s;team by watering the warm flues or
floors; which will afterwards in the colder hours be again con|den&s;ed,
and &s;ettle in the form of dew on the fruit and leaves.</P>
<P>By &s;upplying vegetables as well as animals with an abundancy
of fluid, they are liable to increa&s;e in bulk, both becau&s;e the ex|ternal
cuticle, which confines the growth of both of them, be|comes
relaxed, as is &s;een in the hands of tho&s;e women, who
have many hours been employed in wa&s;hing; and al&s;o becau&s;e
the eutaneous ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els will thus imbibe more fluid
from the external &s;urface; and the cellular ab&s;orbents will there|fore
imbibe le&s;s from the internal cells, and con&s;equently more
mucus or fat will remain in them.</P>
<P>Thus in Lanca&s;hire, where premiums are given for large
goo&s;e-berries, I am told, that &s;ome of tho&s;e who are &s;olicitous
<PB N="380" REF="385">
for the prizes, not only thin the fruit of a goo&s;eberry-tree, &s;o
as to leave but two or three goo&s;eberries on a branch, but then
by &s;upporting a tea-&s;aucer under each of the&s;e goo&s;eberries,
bathe it for &s;ome weeks in &s;o much water as to cover about a
fourth part of it, which they call &s;uckling the goo&s;eberry.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of the Carnatic, where rice is cultivated, they
are &s;aid not to derive the water on it, till it is in flower; be|cau&s;e
that would induce the &s;tem to &s;hoot too luxuriantly, like
our wheat-crops in wet-&s;ea&s;ons; but, as &s;oon as it is in flower,
they find it expedient to flood it with water for the purpo&s;e of
filling and enlarging the ears, (Communications to Board of
Agriculture, Vol. I. p. 355,) which it may effect both by re|laxing
the cuticle of the grain, and preventing the too great
internal ab&s;orption of the mucus or &s;tarch deposited in the cells
of it; and la&s;tly by &s;upplying it with more nutriment.</P>
<P>There are two circumstances to be attended to in giving water
to plants; which are, not to water them during the hot part
of the day in &s;ummer, nor in the evenings of &s;pring, when a
fro&s;t may be expected; in both the&s;e circum&s;tances we may be
&s;aid to copy nature, as rain is generally preceded by a cloudy
&s;ky, and is never accompanied by fro&s;t; though that &s;ometimes
follows it, and is then very injurious to vegetation.</P>
<P>When plants have been long &s;imulated by a hot &s;un&s;hine
into violent action, if this &s;timulus of heat be too greatly and
too &s;uddenly dimini&s;hed by the affu&s;ion of cold water, or by its
&s;udden evaporation, their ve&s;&s;els cea&s;e to act, and death en&s;ues;
exactly as has too frequently happened to tho&s;e, who have bath|ed
in a cold &s;pring of water after having been heated by violent
and continued exerci&s;e on a hot day. When &s;evere fro&s;t fol|lows
the watering of plants, they are rendered torpid, and die
by the too great and &s;udden diminution of the &s;timulus of heat;
which is equally nece&s;&s;ary to the activity of vegetable as to ani|mal
fibres; and in &s;ome in&s;tances the circulation of their fluids
may be &s;topped by the congelation of them; and in others their
ve&s;&s;els may be bur&s;t by the expan&s;ion attending the conver&s;ion
of water into ice; or la&s;tly, by the &s;eparation of their different
fluids by congelation. See Sect. XV. 4. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="386">
When an addition of manure can be procured, as where the
black carbonic juice from a dunghill mixed with water, or &s;oap-&s;uds,
which have been u&s;ed in wa&s;hing, can be employed in|&s;tead
of water alone; it mu&s;t undoubtedly add to the nutriment,
and con&s;equently enlarge the &s;ize of the fruit by that means
al&s;o, as well as by the additional water.</P>
<P>Where too much moi&s;ture is given without at the &s;ame time
an addition of warmth, &s;ome inconveniencies are liable to oc|cur,
as a le&s;s aromatic and &s;accharine flavour of the fruit.
When therefore fruits become nearly ripe, le&s;s water &s;hould be
given them, unle&s;s it is convenient at the &s;ame time to increa&s;e
the heat, in which they are immer&s;ed, as may be done in &s;ome
hot-hou&s;es; and then the flavour of the fruit may be heighten|ed,
as well as its &s;ize increa&s;ed, as &s;hewn by Mr. Ba&s;tard in
the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;act. who planted pine-apple plants in ve&s;|&s;els
of water, and placed the&s;e ve&s;&s;els near the top of the hot-hou&s;e,
or on the fire-flues, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying them
with a greater heat; and produced by the&s;e means both larger,
as he a&s;&s;erts, and better flavoured pine apples.</P>
<P>On this important &s;ubject I &s;hall tran&s;cribe his words, and
&s;hall only add, that &s;team from boiling water is now &s;ucce&s;sfully
u&s;ed in &s;ome hot-hou&s;es for the growth both of vines and of
pines, but mu&s;t require &s;ome attention in the application of it;
as it is occa&s;ionally conveyed through &s;mall apertures, which
perforate a brick arch, which is con&s;tructed &s;omewhat like
the floor of a malt-kiln, where the water boils beneath the beds of
bark or of &s;oil; and is occa&s;ionally admitted into the room
above, and thus &s;upplies moi&s;ture and heat both to the ground
and to the air of the hot-hou&s;e</P>
<P>&startq;My hot-hou&s;e is covered with the be&s;t crown gla&s;s, which
I apprehend gives more heat than the common &s;ort of green
gla&s;s generally u&s;ed for hot-hou&s;es. In the front part of the
hou&s;e, and indeed any where in the lowe&s;t parts of it, the
pine-apple plants will not thrive well in water. The way in
which I treat them is as follows. I place a &s;helf near the high|e&s;t
part of the back wall, &s;o that the pine-plants may &s;tand
without ab&s;olutely touching the gla&s;s, but as near it as can be.
On this &s;helf I place pans full of water, about &s;even or eight
<PB N="382" REF="387">
inches deep; and in the&s;e pans I put the pine-apple plants,
growing in the &s;ame pots of earth, as they are generally planted
in to be plunged into the bark-bed in the common way; that is,
I put the pot of earth with the pine-plant in it in the pan full of
water; and as the water decrea&s;es, I con&s;tantly fill up the pan.
I place either plants in fruit, or young plants as &s;oon as they are
well rooted, in the&s;e pans of water, and find they thrive equal|ly
well; the fruit reared this way is always much larger, as well
as better flavoured, than when ripened in the bark-bed. I
have more than once put only the plants them&s;elves without any
earth, I mean after they had roots, into the&s;e pans of water,
with only water &s;ufficient to keep the roots always covered,
and found them flouri&s;h beyond expectation. A neighbour of
mine has placed a leaden ci&s;tern upon the top of the back flue,
(in which, as it is in contact with the flue, the water is always
warm, when there is fire in the hou&s;e,) and finds his fruit ex|cellent
and large.</P>
<P>&startq;The way I account for this &s;ucce&s;s is, that the warm air
always a&s;cending to the part, where this &s;helf is placed, as be|ing
the highe&s;t part of the hou&s;e, keeps it much hotter than in
any other part. The temperature at that place is, I believe
&s;eldom le&s;s than what is indicated by the 73d degree of Fahren|heit's
thermometer; and when the &s;un &s;hines, it is often at
above 100&deg;; the water the plants grow in &s;eems to enable
them to bear the greate&s;t heat, if &s;ufficient air be allowed; and
I often &s;ee the roots of the plants growing out of the holes in
the bottom of the pot of earth, and &s;hooting vigorou&s;ly in the
water.</P>
<P>&startq;It is not foreign to this purpo&s;e to mention, that, as a per|&s;on
was moving a large pine-plant from the hot-bed in my hou&s;e
la&s;t &s;ummer, which plant was ju&s;t &s;hewing fruit, by &s;ome acci|dent
he broke off the plant ju&s;t above the earth in which it
grew, and there was no root whatever left to it; by way of
experiment I took the plant, and fixed it upright in a pan of
water (without any earth whatever) on the &s;helf; it there &s;oon
threw out roots, and bore a pine-apple that weighed upwards of
two pounds.&endq; Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. Vol LXVII.</P>

6. <HI>Protect the early flowers and the late fruits from fro&s;t.</HI>
The vernal fro&s;ts are very pernicious to the early blo&s;&s;oms of
apples and pears, and of all the tender wall-trees; various
contrivances have been u&s;ed to &s;helter them, as mats &s;u&s;pended
before wall-trees; which in Denmark are &s;aid to be u&s;ed to
&s;helter them from the mid-day &s;un, as well as from the night-fro&s;ts;
both to prevent them from flowering too early, and be|ing
thence expo&s;ed to severer fro&s;ts; and becau&s;e vegetables &s;uf|fer
more from great cold, as well as animals, after having been
expo&s;ed to great heat, as explained in Sect. XIV. 2. 2.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e parts of vegetables, which are mo&s;t &s;ucculent, &s;uffer
mo&s;t from fro&s;t, as the young tops of tender trees, as of the
a&s;h, fraxinus, and weeping willow, &s;alix babylonica; and al&s;o
all other vegetables after having been expo&s;ed to much moi&s;ture,
as to rain or dews; which probably may occur in part from the
greater &s;en&s;ibility of the tender juicy &s;ummits of the pre&s;ent
year's growth, and partly from the expan&s;ion of their frozen
juices, which may bur&s;t the containing ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>An important que&s;tion here occurs, is a low &s;ituation to be
cho&s;en for a garden? The greater warmth of low &s;ituations,
and their being generally better &s;heltered from the cold north-ea&s;t
winds, and the boi&s;terous &s;outh-we&s;t winds, are agreeable
circum&s;tances; as the N. E. winds in this climate are the freez|ing
winds; and S. W. winds being more violent, are liable
much to injure &s;tandard fruit-trees in &s;ummer by da&s;hing their
branches again&s;t each other, and thence brui&s;ing, or beating off
the fruit; but in low &s;ituations the fogs in vernal evenings, by
moi&s;tening the young &s;hoots of trees, and their early flowers,
render them much more liable to the injuries of the fro&s;ty
nights, which &s;ucceed them, which they e&s;cape in higher &s;itua|tions.
The&s;e fogs, which are &s;een by the &s;ides of rivers, and
on damp plains or valleys after &s;un-&s;et, are converted into rime
during the night. And as at the time of the&s;e fogs there is
generally no wind, the dew falls perpendicularly, and the rime is
formed mo&s;t frequently on the upper &s;urface of objects,
which may then therefore be more readily &s;heltered from it
than at other times, when the freezing fog is blown forwards
<PB N="384" REF="389">
by the wind, and the rime is formed on one &s;ide of the branches of trees.</P>
<P>In &s;ome circum&s;tances the rime is believed to defend the ve|getables
on which it is formed, by the heat it gives out at the in|&s;tant
of its freezing, and by covering them from the cold like
&s;now upon the ground; and thence the black fro&s;ts, which are
not attended with rime, are &s;aid to be more prejudicial. But
where dew or mi&s;t de&s;cends on vegetable leaves before the act
of freezing commences, and is in part ab&s;orbed by them; they
become more &s;ucculent, and hence are de&s;troyed by their fluids
being converted into ice, and bur&s;ting the ve&s;&s;els already di&s;|tended
with more water, than they would otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s.
See Sect. XIII. 2. 2.</P>
<P>Mr. Bradley gives a deci&s;ive fact in regard to this &s;ubject.
A friend of his had two gardens, one not many feet below the
other, but &s;o different that the low garden often appeared
flooded with the evening mi&s;ts, when none appeared in the up|per
one; and in a letter to Mr. Bradley he complains that his
lower garden is much injured by the vernal fro&s;t, and not his
upper one. A &s;imilar fact is mentioned by Mr. Lawrence,
who ob&s;erves, that he has often &s;een the leaves and tender
&s;hoots of tall a&s;h-trees in bla&s;ting mi&s;ts to be frozen, and as it
were &s;inged, in all the lower parts and middle of the tree;
while the upper part, which was above the mi&s;t, has been un|injured.
Art of Gardening. In confirmation of this idea I
well remember many years ago to have travelled sixty miles,
partly in the valley of the Trent, and partly over adjacent hills,
on the &s;ixth of May; and to have observed that the new &s;hoots
of all the a&s;h-trees in the vallies had their young extre|mities
entirely turned black by the fro&s;t of the preceding
night; but that on the hills they had e&s;caped, which I at fir&s;t
a&s;cribed to the trees being le&s;s forward on the hills, but believe
it was more probably owing to the greater &s;ucculence of tho&s;e
in the valleys, and to their having been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to
the moi&s;ture of the evening mi&s;t.</P>
<P>The precipitation or adhe&s;ion of moi&s;ture to vegetables, when
mi&s;ty air is blown again&s;t them, is well de&s;cribed by Mr. White
in his hi&s;tory of Shelborne; who ob&s;erved on a foggy day with
<PB N="385" REF="390">
&s;ome wind, that &s;o much moi&s;ture was depo&s;ited on a tree,
that it ran down upon the ground, and filled the ruts of a lane
beneath it, which was dry el&s;ewhere. On the &s;ame account in
the early &s;pring the gra&s;s is &s;een to become green &s;ooner under
the &s;preading branches of trees than in their vicinity. See Bo|tanic
Garden, Vol. I. note 26.</P>
<P>It is hence evident, that very low and damp &s;ituations are
not to be preferred for gardens and orchards in this climate;
and that it is in all gardens an object worthy attention to pro|tect
in the early &s;pring the blo&s;&s;oms and the young &s;hoots from
being moi&s;tened by the de&s;cending night dews; for this purpo&s;e
&s;ome have put coping &s;tones at the top of the fruit-walls, so as
to project &s;ix or eight inches over the trees. By the &s;helter of
the&s;e coping &s;tones the de&s;cending dews, which would moi&s;ten
the young leaves and flowers, are prevented from falling on
them, and in con&s;equence no rime is &s;een in the morning on
the&s;e trees. I had once an opportunity of ob&s;erving &s;ome trees
beneath a protecting coping to be much &s;afer in re&s;pect both
to their fruit and foliage, than tho&s;e in their vicinity, and in
the &s;ame a&s;pect where there were no coping &s;tones over them.</P>
<P>But I am informed, that after the vernal fro&s;ts have cea&s;ed,
this kind of &s;helter is certainly injurious to the growth and per|fection
of the fruit; which may ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e,
namely, the want of the &s;ummer night-dews to moi&s;ten the fruit,
and al&s;o the perpendicular &s;un-beams to ripen it. On the&s;e ac|counts
I have propo&s;ed to make temporary &s;heds of boards to
project eight inches from the walls, to be held on by iron
hooks, which might ea&s;ily be removed, as &s;oon as the vernal
fro&s;ts &s;hould cea&s;e; and in one experiment on a &s;ingle apricot
tree it appeared to &s;ucceed well.</P>
<P>From &s;ome experiments in a late volume in the Philo&s;ophical
Tran&s;actions, it appears, that very much more rain was caught
in gla&s;&s;es placed on the ground near a high church, than was
caught in &s;imilar gla&s;&s;es on the roof of it; which evinces, that
a much greater quantity of moi&s;ture exi&s;ts in the lower parts of
the atmo&s;phere, and is precipitated from it, than from the higher
parts; whence to protect the blo&s;&s;oms more effectually from the
de&s;cending dews coping boards might be placed at every two
<PB N="386" REF="391">
feet or le&s;&s; above each other, with their front edges pointing
upwards to the meridian fun in March, and ledges nailed on the
back edges to convey the rain or dews towards the central part
of the tree, where by another cro&s;s ledge at the end of each
board it might be carried from the wall.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar inconvenience from autumnal fro&s;ts affects &s;ome of
the late fruits, as figs and grapes, which might al&s;o receive ad|vantage
from replacing the coping boards in the autumn.</P>
<P>Another method of effectually guarding again&s;t the vernal
fro&s;ts, and also the autumnal ones, is by building the garden-walls
with fire-flues in them, which is now frequently practi&s;ed.
There is one &s;ecret nece&s;&s;ary to be known, and well attended
to, in the management of fire-flues; and that is in the fir&s;t place
to plant trees, which will open their flowers about the &s;ame
time, again&s;t the &s;ame flue, and then diligently to observe not
to put fire into this flue, till the trees, it is de&s;igned to a&s;&s;ist, are
in flower; &s;ince if the fire be applied &s;ooner, the flowers are for|warded,
and in con&s;equence expo&s;ed to more danger from the
&s;everer fro&s;ts. One friend of mine, who diligently attends to
this circum&s;tance, a&s;&s;ures me, that he never fails of producing a
plentiful crop of excellent fruit.</P>
<P>And it is po&s;&s;ible that one u&s;e of covering apricot trees, be|fore
they flower, from the mid-day &s;un, which is &s;aid to be
practi&s;ed in Denmark, may be to protract their time of flower|ing,
and thus expo&s;e them to le&s;s danger from fro&s;t, as well as
to prevent their irritability from being exhau&s;ted by the heat,
and thus cau&s;ing the night air to be more injurious to them.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Fruits may be &s;ooner ripened by wounding them, or by gathering them.</HI> The wounds inflicted by in&s;ects on many fruits
promotes their more &s;peedy ripening, as well as tho&s;e in|flicted
by caprification, mentioned in Sect. XIV. 3. 3. and in
No. 3. 4. of this Section. It is &s;aid that cutting the &s;talk of a
bunch of grapes half through, which has acquired its due &s;ize,
will expedite the ripening of it; becau&s;e it will then be &s;upplied
with a le&s;s quantity of new juices, and the change of its acerb
juices into &s;accharine ones, which is partly a chemical, and
partly a vegetable proce&s;s, proceeds more rapidly. See Sect. X. 8. 1. On the &s;ame account the pears on a branch, which
<PB N="387" REF="392">
has had a circle of its bark cut away, will ripen its fruit &s;ooner;
and tho&s;e annual plants, which are &s;upplied with le&s;s water than
u&s;ual, both flower &s;ooner, and ripen their &s;eed &s;ooner.</P>
<P>To which may be added, that gathering pears from the tree
before they are ripe, and laying them on heaps covered with
blankets, is known con&s;iderably to forward their ripening, by
&s;omething like a chemical fermentation added to the living ac|tion
of the fruit, which advances the &s;accharine proce&s;s with
greater rapidity.</P>
<P>I have &s;een apricots at table, which I was informed were
plucked from the tree, and kept &s;ome days in a hot-hou&s;e, and
thus became deliciou&s;ly ripe; in the &s;ame manner as har&s;h pears
ripen almo&s;t into a &s;yrup during twelve or twenty hours baking
in a &s;low oven; which occa&s;ioned the je&s;t of a French traveller,
who on being a&s;ked on his return, what good fruit they had in
England, an&s;wered, that the only ripe fruit he happened to ta&s;te
was the baked pear.</P>
<P>IV. THE ARTS OF PRESERVING FRUIT, as they depend on
the prevention of the chemical proce&s;&s;es, which produce their
di&s;&s;olution, ought to be here mentioned.</P>
<P>1. As life whether animal or vegetable prevents putrefac|tion,
and as many fruits exi&s;t long, after they are gathered from
the tree, before they become ripe and die &s;pontaneously, and
in con&s;equence putrefy, as crabs, &s;loes, medlars, and au&s;tere
pears. The art of pre&s;erving the&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in &s;toring them,
where the heat is neither much above or below 48 degrees,
which is the temperature of the interior parts of the earth; that
is, in a dry cellar, or beneath the &s;oil, or well covered with &s;traw
or mats in a dry chamber. As greater heat might make them
ripen &s;ooner, than they are wanted, by the increa&s;ed activity
of their vegetable life; and fro&s;t by de&s;troying that life would
&s;ubject them to putrefy, when they become thawed; as perpetually
happens to apples and potatoes, which are not well de|fended
from fro&s;t. And la&s;tly, the moi&s;ture would injure them
many ways; fir&s;t by its contributing to de&s;troy their vegetable
life; &s;econdly in promoting the chemical proce&s;s of putrefac|tion;
and thirdly by its encouraging the growth of mucor, or
<PB N="388" REF="393">
mould, which will grow in moi&s;t &s;ituations without much light or air.</P>
<P>Too great warmth de&s;troys both animal and vegetable life by
&s;timulating their ve&s;&s;els into too great activity for a time, whence
a &s;ub&s;equent torpor from the too great previous expenditure of
the living power, which terminates in death. After the death
of the organization a boiling heat congulates the mucilaginous
fluids, and if continued would I believe prevent the chemical
fermentation of them; and that thus both vegetable and animal
&s;ub&s;tances might be pre&s;erved. The experiment is difficult to
try, and could not therefore be of much practical utility if it
&s;hould &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Great cold on the contrary de&s;troys both animals and vege|tables
by the torpor occa&s;ioned by the defect of &s;timulus, and a
con&s;equent temporary death. Afterwards if a great degree of
cold be continued, in &s;ome ca&s;es the expan&s;ion of their freezing
juices may bur&s;t the vegetable ve&s;&s;els, and thus render the life
of them irrecoverable. But there is another curious thing hap|pens
to many aqueous &s;olutions, or diffu&s;ions, which is, that
at the time of congelation the di&s;&s;olved or diffu&s;ed particles are
pu&s;hed from the ice, either to the centre, if the cold be applied
equally on all &s;ides, or into various cells, as mentioned in Sect.
XIII. 2. 2.</P>
<P>This exclu&s;ion of &s;alt is &s;een in freezing any &s;aline &s;olution
in water; as common &s;alt or blue vitriol expo&s;ed to &s;evere fro&s;t
in a two-ounce phial are driven to the centre of it. Wine, vine|gar,
and even milk, may be thus deprived of much of their
water. Very moi&s;t clay, when expo&s;ed to fro&s;ty air, &s;hrinks
and becomes much more &s;olid according to the a&s;&s;ertion of Mr.
Kirwan. Mineralog. Vol. I. p. 9, the freezing water covering
its &s;urface with ice, and driving the molecules of clay nearer the
centre. And la&s;tly, the mucilage produced by boiling wheat
flour in water, like book-binders pa&s;te, if not too thick, lo&s;es its
cohe&s;ion by being frozen, the water driving, as it freezes, the &s;tarch from its cry&s;tallization; and from this circum&s;tance pro|bably
is occa&s;ioned the change of flavour of apples, potatoes,
and other vegetables, on being thawed after they have been frozen.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="394">
It is neverthele&s;s affirmed, I think, by Mon&s;. Reaumeur, that
if frozen apples be dipped in cold water repeatedly, and the ice
thus formed on their &s;urface be wiped off, or if they be left in
a large pail full of very cold water, &s;o that they may not thaw
too ha&s;tily, they will not lo&s;e their flavour. If this be true,
and the apples will keep &s;ound &s;ome time afterwards, it would
&s;eem that the vegetable life was not de&s;troyed; but that, like
&s;leeping in&s;ects, they were reanimated by the warmth; otherwi&s;e,
if the flavour be not de&s;troyed, and they could be immediately
eaten or u&s;ed in cookery, it is &s;till a valuable di&s;covery if true,
and might lead us to pre&s;erve variety of fruits in ice-hou&s;es, as
&s;trawberries, currants, grapes, and pines, to the great advan|tage
of &s;ociety. See Sect. XVII. 2. 4.</P>
<P>As the proce&s;s of fermentation will not commence or conti|nue,
I believe, in the heat of boiling water, or 212; and as
this degree of heat can be ea&s;ily pre&s;erved by &s;team, or by the
vicinity of ve&s;&s;els containing boiling water; it is probable, that
fruits for the u&s;e of cookery might be thus pre&s;erved throughout
the year, as the pulp of boiled apples, goo&s;eberries, &amp;c. put into
bottles, and placed &s;o as to be expo&s;ed to the wa&s;ted &s;team of
&s;team-engines, or immer&s;ed in the hot water, which flows from
the conden&s;ing of it; or near the boilers fixed behind &s;ome
kitchen fires; as I &s;u&s;pect, that if such a degree of heat could
be applied once a day, it would counteract the tendency to fer|mentation.</P>
<P>2. Another method of pre&s;erving &s;ome fruits is by gathering
them during their acid &s;tate, before that acid juice is converted
into &s;ugar, as lemons, oranges, goo&s;eberries, pears, and &s;ome
apples; and if a part of the water be evaporated by a boiling heat
&s;o as to leave the acidity more concentrated, it is le&s;s liable to
ferment, and in con&s;equence will be longer pre&s;erved. For this
purpo&s;e the fruit &s;hould be kept in a cellar, and corked in bottles,
&s;o as to be precluded from the changes of air, and variations of
heat; goo&s;eberries, and rhubarb-&s;talks, are thus &s;ucce&s;sfully pre|&s;erved
for winter u&s;e; and if a tea &s;poonful of brandy be put
into each quart bottle, it will prevent the growth of mucor or mould upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="395">
3. As &s;ugar will not pa&s;s into fermentation unle&s;s diluted with
much water, and le&s;s &s;o in low degrees of heat, many fruits may
be thus pre&s;erved by impregnating them with &s;ugar, and the bet|ter
if they are kept in a dry cellar. Dr. Hales found that by
inverting the end of a branch of a tree into a bottle of brandy
for a few hours, that the whole branch died; hence it is u&s;ual
and u&s;eful to cover pre&s;erved fruits with a paper moi&s;tened with
vinous &s;pirit, which prevents the growth of mucor or mould upon
their &s;urfaces, which is a vegetable thus ea&s;ily killed by the in|toxicating
&s;timulus.</P>
<P>If &s;weet fruits be dried by heat, not only the &s;uperfluous water
becomes exhaled, but the &s;accharine proce&s;s is al&s;o promoted, and
much of the mucilaginous or acid particles are converted into
&s;ugar, as in baking pears, or in drying figs, dates, rai&s;ins, apri|cots;
&s;o that by gradually drying them many fruits may be well
pre&s;erved, and require afterwards &s;imply to be kept dry.</P>
<P>4. Some fruits, as the olive, are pre&s;erved in their unripe
&s;tate in &s;alt and water; the unripe pods of kidney-beans, and
the hats of mu&s;hrooms, may be thus al&s;o kept for months in
weak brine in a cool cellar enclo&s;ed in bottles without much
change. But the oily kernels of nuts are well pre&s;erved in
cellars beneath the &s;oil to preclude the variations of heat, and
covered in jars to prevent their evaporation. Other fruits are
converted into pickles and pre&s;erved in vinegar, but lo&s;e their
flavour; and others by being immer&s;ed in vinous &s;pirit are pre|&s;erved,
as cherries, and thus tran&s;muted from food to poi&s;on.
And when the kernels of apricots, cherries, or bitter almonds,
are pre&s;erved in brandy, which is called ratafia, we po&s;&s;&s;s a
mixture of two of the mo&s;t poi&s;onous productions of the vegeta|ble
kingdom; except perhaps the leaves of lauro-cera&s;us di&s;til|led
in alcohol, which was &s;old as ratafia in Dublin, and pro|duced
many &s;udden deaths in the gin-&s;hops.</P>

which contribute mo&s;t to the nouri&s;hment of mankind, many of
which are the progeny of annual or biennial plants, require other
modes of cultivation.</P>
<P>As an introduction to this &s;ection it may be ob&s;erved, how
much more ingenuity was required in the di&s;covery of nouri&s;h|ing
mankind by the &s;mall &s;eeds of the gra&s;&s;es, which have pro|bably
been &s;ince much enlarged by perpetual cultivation, than by
the large roots of potatoes. The I&s;is or O&s;iris of Egypt &s;eems

flax, on the banks of the Nile; and afterwards Ceres and Trip|tolemus
to have taught the former of the&s;e important di&s;coveries
all over the known world. While in later ages the Incas or
Motezumas of Peru and Mexico &s;eem to have de&s;troyed the

<HEAD>I. 1. To produce &s;eeds early in the &s;ea&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>Tho&s;e plants, which are required to yield a forward crop, as
the peas and beans of our gardens, and tho&s;e which our cold
and &s;hort &s;ummers will not otherwi&s;e perfectly ripen, as wheat,
&s;hould be &s;owed before the commencement of winter, either in
<PB N="395" REF="400">
natural ground, as in the cultivation of wheat, or in &s;ituations
&s;heltered from the north-ea&s;t, as in the garden cultivation of peas
and beans; or they may be &s;owed very thick in hot-hou&s;es, or
under hot-bed frames, or under warm walls, and be tran&s;plant|ed,
when they are one or two inches high, into the natural
ground at due di&s;tances, when the weather is milder, and the
plants are become hardier or le&s;s liable to be de&s;troyed from
their having longer acquired the habits of life.</P>
<P>When young plants of any kind are tran&s;planted, the ground
&s;hould be recently dug, as their expeditious growth depends &s;o
much on the atmo&s;pheric air being buried in the pores or inter|&s;tices
of the earth by the production of carbonic and nitrous
acids, and ammonia, and heat.</P>
<P>The &s;ame advantage occurs by &s;oaking &s;eeds in water, or in
the drainage from manure heaps, till they are ready to &s;prout,
and then &s;owing them in a &s;oil lately turned over; as their roots
will then immediately put out by the newly generated heat, and
newly produced carbonic acid in its fluid not its ga&s;&s;eous &s;tate.</P>
<P>2. The tran&s;planting of young roots, if they be &s;et no deeper
than before, does not, I &s;uppo&s;e, multiply the number of &s;tems,
as occurs when wheat is tran&s;planted &s;o deep as to cover the
&s;econd joint; but by tearing off &s;everal &s;mall extremities of the
roots, the new production of many viviparous buds is prevented,
and that of oviparous buds increa&s;ed in con&s;equence, for rea&s;ons
mentioned in No. 2. 4. of the preceding Section.</P>
<P>When the roots of wheat are tran&s;planted and divided, not
only a great increa&s;e of the crop is produced, but I believe the
&s;eed is likewi&s;e ripened earlier, as is asserted by Mr. Bogle.
Bath Society, Vol. III. p. 494. And it is well known to
gardeners, that tran&s;planting garden-beans forwards them in
re&s;pect to time, but &s;hortens the height of the &s;tem. Hence
tran&s;planted vegetables grow le&s;s in height, as tran&s;planted
beans, and le&s;s branchy, as tran&s;planted melons, but produce
and ripen their &s;eeds earlier; which is a great advantage in the
&s;hort &s;ummers of this climate; and if the roots can be divided,
as in wheat, or new &s;cions can be produced by their being tran&s;|planted
deeper, as al&s;o occurs in wheat, the quantity of the
<PB N="396" REF="401">
&s;eed may al&s;o be wonderfully increa&s;ed by tran&s;planting. See
Sect XII. 6.</P>
<P>3. Another mode of forwarding the production of &s;eeds,
and of &s;ooner ripening them, con&s;i&s;ts in pruning off the vivipa|rous
tops or lateral &s;hoots, which will bear no &s;eeds at all, or
only &s;mall or imperfect ones, in our northern &s;ummers. For
this purpo&s;e the cutting away the tops of beans and of peas, and
the lateral branches of artichokes, after the fruit-buds are form|ed,
both forwards and enlarges the flowers and &s;eeds, which
remain, as more nouri&s;hment is derived to them.</P>
<P>4. As a &s;uperfluous &s;upply of water is more friendly to the
production of leaf-buds than to the generation of flower-buds, to
derive le&s;s water than u&s;ual to the roots, forwards the produc|tion
of &s;eeds, a fact well known in the gardens of warmer cli|mates,
which are perpetually watered from re&s;ervoirs or wheel-engines.
But when the blo&s;&s;oms appear, an addition of water
mu&s;t forward their growth by supplying nouri&s;hment, which
&s;hould again be le&s;&s;ened when the fruit has acquired its full
&s;ize, both to expedite its ripening, and to increa&s;e its flavour; as
the &s;accharine matter and e&s;&s;ential oil will be le&s;s diluted with
water.</P>
<P>In the dry &s;ummer of 1799 I had the opportunity of flooding
&s;ome rows of beans in my garden, which by being done too
frequently, or too copiou&s;ly, occa&s;ioned them to grow to a
much greater height than u&s;ual, and in con&s;equence to bring to
perfection few &s;eeds, and &s;ome of them none. As I &s;uppo&s;e
the new &s;hoots of fig-trees in the beginning of &s;ummer occa&s;ions
the fir&s;t production of young figs to fall off from the want of
that nouri&s;hment, which is now expended in the growth of
new leaf-buds. See Sect. XV. 3. 4. Whence the facility of pro|ducing
leaf-buds &s;eems evidently to prevent the generation of
flower-buds, and the u&s;e of cutting off the &s;ummits of tall beans
is thus explained, as directed above.</P>
<P>II. 1. <HI>To produce &s;eeds in great quantity</HI> from annual or
biennial plants they &s;hould be brought forward in re&s;pect to the
&s;ea&s;on in our northern &s;ummers; that a greater quantity of vivi|parous
buds may arrive early at their maturity for the purpo&s;e
of generating oviparous buds &s;oon enough in the &s;ummer to
<PB N="397" REF="402">
ripen their &s;eeds; on this account tho&s;e &s;hould be &s;own in the
autumn which will bear the &s;everity of the winter.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the &s;eeds of tho&s;e plants, which are natives of
this climate, &s;hould probably be &s;owed at the time they become
perfectly ripe, as occurs to them in their natural &s;tate; that is,
either when the &s;eed is &s;hed upon the ground by the parent
plant, or when the fruit or hu&s;k, which enclo&s;es it, becomes naturally ripe after it has fallen on the ground. Thus I have
&s;een crabs covered with leaves in hedge-bottoms, which have not
decayed till the early &s;pring. Many pears do not become ripe
in our &s;tore-rooms till March or April; and ivy berries and
holly berries hang on their re&s;pective trees till the vernal months,
and are not till that time eaten by the thru&s;hes. Hence it is
probable, that the &s;eeds in the&s;e durable fruits or berries continue
to ripen, or to become more mature, and prepared for their
future growth during the winter months.</P>
<P>2. It was &s;hewn in Sect. IX. 3. 7. that when wheat was tran&s;planted &s;o deep as to immer&s;e the fir&s;t joint about the root
into the &s;oil, many new &s;tems would &s;hoot up and &s;trike their
roots into the earth; and that thus four or &s;ix new plants, or
more, would be generated by the caudex of the leaf-bud, which
con&s;titutes that joint. This mode of tran&s;plant$tion therefore
will much increa&s;e the quantity of the crop of &s;eed, if it can
be done soon enough for the&s;e additional &s;tems to ripen their
corn, before the &s;ummer ends.</P>
<P>There is another mode of increa&s;ing this product of additional
&s;tems without tran&s;plantation, which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;owing the
wheat in rows by what is called a drill-plough according to Mr.
Tull's method; and when the fir&s;t &s;tems ri&s;e a few inches high,
a hor&s;e-hoe, made like a very &s;mall plough, is to be brought &s;o
near each row, as to turn up &s;ome earth again&s;t the &s;tems, &s;o
as to cover the fir&s;t joint above the root with &s;oil; whence new
&s;tems will be generated, and &s;hoot up round the old one; and
thus increa&s;e the crop in the &s;ame manner as by deep tran&s;plan|tation.</P>
<P>The theory of Mr. Tull's drill hu&s;bandry is explained in
Sect. IX. 3. 7. and in XII. 5. which is of late years &s;uppo&s;ed
to have been improved by introducing the hand-hoe in place of
<PB N="398" REF="403">
the hor&s;e-hoe, and thus giving an opportunity of &s;owing the
rows or drills nearer together, as will be &s;een by the following
method, now introduced into almo&s;t general u&s;e in Nor&s;olk by
Mr. Coke; though Mr. Tull him&s;elf much prefers the hor&s;e-hoe
as turning over the earth much deeper than the hand-hoe,
and thus rendering that part of it more expo&s;ed to the air, which
was before more deeply &s;$cluded from it; and al&s;o rendering it
more pervious to vegetable roots; to which may be added, that
both kinds of hoeing render the &s;urface more permeable to the
rains and dews, and prevent the cracks in dry weather, which are
very injurious to the roots of plants; both which advantages
depend on the poro&s;ity of the &s;oil, which mu&s;t extend deeper
by the u&s;e of the hor&s;e-hoe than the hand-hoe.</P>
<P>Mr Tull makes other ingenious remarks on the u&s;e of hor&s;e-hoeing.
In the beginning of winter, when the wheat has ob|tained
one blade like gra&s;s, or two or three leaves, the hor&s;e-hoe
is brought near the rows and deep, and the earth turned
from them &s;o as to form a ridge between them. By this ridge
in level grounds he thinks the rows are &s;haded from the cold
winds in &s;ome &s;ituations, and that the roots of the wheat are
kept drier, and thence le&s;s injured by fro&s;ts. In the &s;pring
this ridge in the intervals between the rows is divided by the
hor&s;e-hoe, and turned back again&s;t the rows of corn after it has
been fertilized by the air and rains, and dews of winter. See
Tull's hu&s;bandry, Ch. IX and Sect. XII. 5. of this work.</P>
<P>Mr. Coke of Holkham in Norfolk, a&s;&s;ured me, that in thir|teen
years experience on a farm of 3000 acres he had found the
drill hu&s;bandry in that country greatly &s;uperior to &s;owing &s;eeds
of all &s;orts by the hand in what is termed the broad-ca&s;t method,
but differs in the number and arrangement of his rows from the
method of Mr. Tull in the following circumstances.</P>
<P>Mr. Tull drilled two rows of &s;eed a few inches from each
other, and then left a &s;pace of two or three feet, and then drill|led
two more rows near each other, for the purpo&s;e of pa&s;&s;ing
a hoe between each double row drawn by a hor&s;e, which was
therefore termed a hor&s;e-hoe; but Mr. Coke drills all his rows
of wheat and of peas nine inches from each other, and tho&s;e of
barley &s;ix inches and three qu$rters from each other; this is
<PB N="399" REF="404">
performed by a drill plough made by the Rev. Mr. Cook, which
drills &s;ix rows at a time, and thus &s;ows an acre of land in an
hour, and is drawn by a &s;ingle hor&s;e; and the quantity of &s;eed
con&s;umed is about &s;ix or &s;even pecks to an acre, which is about
half what is u&s;ed in the &s;owing by the hand in the broad-ca&s;t
method.</P>
<P>Early in March Mr. Coke u&s;es the hand-hoe, which for hoeing
the rows of wheat and of peas is about &s;ix inches wide, and for
hoeing tho&s;e of barley about four inches wide. By this hoe the
&s;urface is not only turned over, and the weeds between the rows
rooted up, but it is al&s;o accumulated about the roots of the grow|ing
corn, and covers and con&s;equently de&s;troys the low growth of
poppies among&s;t them; which are a very frequent weed in that
part of the country. A &s;econd hoeing is performed about the
middle of May, and the &s;oil is again not only cleared from weeds
but accumulated again&s;t the ri&s;ing corn, each of which hoeings
co&s;t about twenty-pence an acre.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s I am informed, that some attentive agricultors
u&s;e the hor&s;e-hoe belonging to Mr. Cook's drill-machine, though
the rows of corn are but nine inches from each other; and a&s;&s;ert,
that this occa&s;ional trampling of the hor&s;e on the young plants is
of no very ill con&s;equence, a circum&s;tance well worth ob&s;erving,
as it removes the principal di&s;advantage of the hor&s;e-hoe, which
con&s;i&s;ts in the too great di&s;tance of the alternate rows of the
corn-plants.</P>
<P>By the earth being thus accumulated again&s;t the roots of the
corn it is &s;aid to tiller or tellure much; that is, to throw out four
or &s;ix &s;tems, or more, around the original &s;tem, and thus to in|crea&s;e
the number of $ars like tran&s;planting the roots, in&s;omuch
that Mr. Coke obtains by this method between four and five quar|ters
of wheat on every acre, which in the broad-ca&s;t method of
&s;owing did not yield more than three quarters on an acre, be&s;ide
&s;aving a &s;trike and half of the &s;eed corn, unnece&s;&s;arily con&s;umed
in the broad-ca&s;t method of &s;owing. To this &s;hould be added
another advantage, that as the land is thus kept clear from weeds,
and has its &s;urface twice turned over, and thus expo&s;ed to the air,
it is found to &s;ave one ploughing for the purpo&s;e of a &s;ucceeding
crop of turnips.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="405">
It is probable, that one hand-hoeing in the beginning of winter, &s;o managed as to turn the &s;oil from the roots of the corn, and to
leave it rather elevated between the rows, as Mr. Tull recommends
to be performed by his hor&s;e-hoe, might give a &s;imilar advantage
to this mode of cultivation; and al&s;o if another hand-hoeing was
applied, as &s;oon as the wheat is out of blo&s;&s;om, to &s;upply more
nouri&s;hment to the young &s;eed might increa&s;e its plumpne&s;s and
weight, as mentioned in No. 2. 3. of this Section.</P>
<P>The lands thus managed by Mr. Coke are laid level, and not
in ridges and furrows, and can thus be ploughed cro&s;swi&s;e; and
the crop is equally good throughout the whole; whereas in the
furrows of &s;ome lands it is le&s;s forward or le&s;s prolific than on the
ridges; whence much light corn is mixed with the good, which
is obliged to be &s;eparated from that, which is marketable, and
u&s;ed for hogs or poultry. Add to this, that in this mode of
hu&s;bandry the &s;traw is believed to be larger and in greater quan|tity
as well as the grain, and the land to be le&s;s impoveri&s;hed, as
no weeds are &s;uffered to grow on it, and as its &s;urface is &s;o fre|quently
turned over, and expo&s;ed to the air.</P>
<P>In China the corn lands are laid on a level, not in ridges and
furrows; which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the mo&s;t advantageous plan in
almo&s;t every &s;ituation, which is proper for the cultivation of corn,
as by being thus rendered capable of being divided by cro&s;s-ploughing,
almo&s;t any kind of &s;oil may be rendered more proper
for the u&s;e of the drill hu&s;bandry, by which it is &s;een in the above
account of the Norfolk management, that twelve &s;trikes more of
wheat are rai&s;ed on an acre, and one &s;trike and a half &s;aved in the
con&s;umption of &s;eed-wheat, which at &s;ix &s;hilling a &s;trike ari&s;es to
a con&s;iderable &s;um on a large farm.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s there &s;eem to be many advantages attending the
forming the &s;urface of land into ridges and furrows; in wet lands
with a &s;ub&s;tratum of clay the furrows are convenient channels to
carry off the water, where there is a &s;ufficient declivity, as treated
of by Mr. Tull in his Hor&s;e-hoeing Hu&s;bandry, Ch. XVI.
Add to this, that in &s;ome &s;ituations a deeper &s;tratum of the &s;oil,
where it is valuable, may be occa&s;ionally turned up, and expo&s;ed
to the air, and to the roots of vegetables, by gradually changing
the locality of the ridges; and la&s;tly, in every &s;ituation a greater
<PB N="401" REF="406">
&s;urface both of the &s;oil, and of the &s;ummits of the &s;tems, or ears,
are expo&s;ed to the influence of the air by means of ridges and
furrows; for as the plants of wheat are but three or four feet
high, the &s;urface of a crop of wheat is increa&s;ed as well as the
&s;urface of the ground it grows upon, and not as the ba&s;e on which
the declivities or hills re&s;t, as &s;ome have erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed.
See Sect. X. 3. 8.</P>
<P>There is another method of &s;owing wheat in rows u&s;ed in &s;ome
countries, which is termed dibbling in the language of agricultors,
and con&s;i&s;ts in making perpendicular holes one inch and half or
two inches deep, as is commonly done in planting potatoe-roots;
the&s;e holes are made by a man, who has a proper &s;taff
&s;hod with iron in each hand, and as he walks backwards is able
by looking at the part of the row already made to keep nearly in
a &s;traight line, and to make two holes at once at about nine inches
di&s;tant from each other every way. Two or more children at|tend
the man, and drop two, or three, or four &s;eeds into each
perpendicular hole, which are afterwards covered by drawing
over them what is called a bu&s;h-harrow.</P>
<P>This method by &s;owing the wheat in rows adapts it for the u&s;e
of the hand-hoe, as by &s;owing it by a drill machine, but mu&s;t be
attended with greater expence, and I &s;u&s;pect with le&s;s accuracy of
the di&s;tribution of the &s;eed, owing to the hurry or fatigue of the
children employed; and I al&s;o &s;u&s;pect that &s;owing in drills is pre|ferable,
becau&s;e a greater quantity of earth is turned over, and
much air in con&s;equence included in its inter&s;tices; whereas in
making perpendicular holes the &s;ides of the holes are compre&s;&s;ed,
and rendered more &s;olid; whence potatoe-roots al&s;o might pro|bably
be more advantageou&s;ly planted by making drills in&s;tead of
perpendicular holes.</P>
<P>A corre&s;pondent of die board of agriculture a&s;&s;erts, that on
looking over a field of potatoes near Leice&s;ter, which had all
been planted at the &s;ame time, and on land equally manured,
he ob&s;erved a great difference of the growth of one part of the
field, which on enquiry he found to have been owing to the roots
having been planted in drills, where the plants were &s;o much
&s;tronger; and by a &s;etting &s;tick in holes, where they were &s;o
muchle&s;s vigorous; Engli&s;h Encyclopedia, Art. Hu&s;bandry, p.
<PB N="402" REF="407">
483: which difference of growth I &s;uppo&s;e to have been owing
to the circum&s;tances above mentioned.</P>
<P>A few ears of wheat were lately given me, which were branch|ed,
having four or five le&s;s ears growing out of each &s;ide of the
principal ear; it was procured at Liverpool, and was called
Egyptian wheat, or Smyrna wheat. It is de&s;cribed in the Sup|plem.
Plantarum of the younger Linneus, as well as in the &s;pe|cies
Plantarum of the elder; and is &s;aid to be a native of Egypt,
and to be cultivated at Naples; it is called &startq;triticum compo&s;itum,
or wheat with a compound ear, crowded with le&s;s cars, awned;
and is &s;aid to be related to triticum aestivum, &s;ummer wheat; but
the &s;pike is four times larger, a hand in length, compo&s;ed of le&s;s
&s;pikes, two faced, alternate, approximated, from nine to twelve,
the lower ones being &s;horter, and the top one &s;olitary.&endq; Suppl.
Plant. p. 115.</P>
<P>The plant, which was given me, had five tall and thick &s;tems
from one root, but &s;eemed to have been plucked up before it was
quite ripe, whence I cannot judge of the &s;ize of the grain, but
&s;hould imagine, that it is a &s;pecies well worthy of attention. The
few ears, which I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were &s;own in the &s;pring of this year,
1799, not having obtained them &s;oon enough to &s;ow in the
autumn. When they were an inch or two high, they were
tran&s;planted into a moi&s;ti&s;h part of my garden; and though the
year has been uncommonly cold and wet, and a great part of the
autumn-&s;own wheat of this country is blown down upon the
ground, and is not yet ripe, yet almo&s;t every root of the Egyptian
wheat has from ten to twelve &s;tems, and &s;tands upright on &s;trong
&s;traw about three and a half, or four feet high. The be&s;t &s;tems
have one principal ear about five inches long, with five or &s;ix
&s;horter ones branching out on each &s;ide of it. They begin to ap|pear
brown, and I hope will ripen. I have since found that this
&s;pecies of wheat is mentioned in Tull's Hu&s;bandry under the
name of Smyrna wheat. He adds that it is highly productive,
but on that account requires a good &s;oil.</P>
<P>3. Another method of promoting the growth of lateral &s;tems
con&s;i&s;ts in de&s;troying the central &s;hoot; when this is done, other
new &s;tems ari&s;e from the joint immediately above the root, which
in wheat is in contact with the earth. On this account, when
<PB N="403" REF="408">
wheat plants are &s;ufficiently forward in re&s;pect to the &s;ea&s;on, it is
thought to be advantageous to eat the fir&s;t &s;tem down by &s;heep to
increa&s;e the quantity of the &s;ub&s;equent crop. See Sect. IX. 3. 7.
It &s;hould be nevertheless ob&s;erved here, that the trampling of
the &s;heep on lands, which are not too adhe&s;ive, will pre&s;s down
the fir&s;t or &s;econd joint into the earth, and thus a&s;&s;i&s;t the pro|duction
of many &s;ide &s;hoots. But in very adhe&s;ive &s;oils this
trampling of the &s;tems into the ground may be injurious. See a
paper in Bath Agriculture, Vol. I. Art. XV. In &s;oils which
are not too adhe&s;ive, when the crop appears thin, it is probable,
that a roller drawn over it by pre&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t or &s;econd joint into the
&s;oil, might promote the production of &s;ide &s;hoots, or make
them tiller, or tellure, in the language of agricultors. And
when gra&s;s or clover &s;eeds are de&s;igned to be &s;own on the wheat-land,
it might fir&s;t be harrowed, and then either rolled or
trampled by the &s;heep, which eat it; either or both of which
might pre&s;s down the root-&s;tems of the corn, and cover the
newly &s;own clover-&s;eeds with &s;oil.</P>
<P>This mode of eating down forward wheat with &s;heep is analo|gous
to cutting off the central buds of melons and cucumbers to
make them produce earlier fruit, and in this climate perhaps in
greater quantity; as tho&s;e produced after the great extent and
elongation of the central branches would be too late to ripen in
this climate: and by their exuberant generation of a viviparous
progeny would retard the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of lateral &s;hoots, and a con|&s;equent
quicker production of flowers.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s where the crop is not too luxuriant or too for|ward,
the eating down the fir&s;t &s;tem by &s;heep may be an injurious
practice; as Mr. Tull thinks, that by thus de&s;troying the fir&s;t
&s;tem, the ears of the latter ones have not time to ripen, and thence
becoming light in re&s;pect to the &s;ize or plumpne&s;s of the grain;
and that the&s;e &s;econdary &s;tems become weak, and are liable to
fall down, both which he &s;ays commonly occur where the crops
are eated by &s;heep.</P>
<P>Mr. Tull, who&s;e work is throughout a great effort of human
genius, adds a very wi&s;e axiom, &startq;that it is mo&s;t advantageous to
ha&s;ten, what we can, the time of blo&s;&s;oming; and to protract
the time of ripening.&endq; Hor&s;e-hoeing Hu&s;bandry, Ch. XI. p.
<PB N="404" REF="409">
147; for it is the farinaceous re&s;ervoir of nutriment laid up in
the cotyledon of the new &s;eed for the future growth of the cor|culum
or new embryon, for which we cultivate the plant; and
this re&s;ervoir is formed between the blo&s;&s;oming and ripening of
the grain, either before or after the impregnation of the pericarp,
or &s;eed-ve&s;&s;els, and thus renders the grain plump and heavy. Mr.
Tull in another part of his work recommends an additional hor&s;e-hoeing
immediately after the blo&s;&s;om it over, to &s;upply more nu|triment
to the ripening grain. Ch. IX. p. 120. Mr. Tull e&s;|teems
the eating down of wheat by &s;heep to be generally a very
injurious practice in this climate, by rendering the ears light and
the &s;traw weak; by retarding the time of blo&s;&s;oming, as well as
the growth of the &s;tems.</P>
<P>4. In the moi&s;t &s;prings of this climate many annual or biennial
plants are liable to &s;hoot out too many or too &s;trong viviparous
branches, which can not generate flower-buds &s;oon enough to ri|pen
their &s;eeds in our cold and &s;hort &s;ummers. This always hap|pens
to cucumbers and melons, which were brought from warmer
countries, and to the peas and beans of our gardens, and &s;ome|times
to corn plants, which are liable in wet &s;ea&s;ons to produce
too &s;trong &s;tems and foliage, which have not time to generate the
flower-bud at their &s;ummit &s;oon enough to perfect and to ripen the
&s;eed. Melons and cucumbers have been mentioned in Sect. XV.
2. 5. and in re&s;pect to garden beans their viviparous tops &s;hould
be pinched off, which if not too old may be eaten as an agreea|ble
vegetable&punc; when well boiled; and thus more nutriment is de|rived
to the oviparous buds beneath, which renders them larger,
and perhaps more numerous. To prevent field peas from running
into &s;traw in moi&s;t &s;oils le&s;s manure &s;hould be u&s;ed; and field
beans may have their tops cut off by a &s;cythe fixed into a &s;traight
&s;haft.</P>
<P>Annual cotton plants are much cultivated in &s;ome colder parts
of the Chine&s;e empire, and the cultivators lop off the tops to in|crea&s;e
the number of pods, and to ha&s;ten their production; and
in the We&s;t Indies the flowers of the ro&s;e tree are believed to be
accelerated and increa&s;ed by topping the branches. Emba&s;&s;y to
China by &s;ir G. Staunton, Vol. III. p. 202. 8vo. edit.</P>
<P>When the &s;tems and foliage of wheat are thus too vigorous, it
may be advantageous to eat it down by &s;heep as above mentioned;
which may not only de&s;troy the too&punc; vigorous viviparous central
<PB N="405" REF="410">
&s;tems, but al&s;o produce a greater number of lateral ones; which
may &s;ooner terminate in oviparous ones, &s;o as to produce more
grain with le&s;s &s;traw.</P>
<P>5. It is al&s;o probable, that rolling them as mentioned above, if
it be done in a morning before the dew is off, might &s;o far brui&s;e
the &s;tems and roots, as to &s;top their too great propen&s;ity to nou|ri&s;h
the viviparous buds, and in con&s;equence to favour the growth
of the oviparous buds on their &s;ummits; which might forward
the harve&s;t &s;ea&s;on, as well as increa&s;e the product of grain in
proportion to the quantity of &s;traw. From rolling wheat in &s;pring
on fields where the &s;urface remains uneven or cloddy, another ad|vantage
may be derived, by breaking the clods or eminences, and
thus earthing up many of the &s;tems above the &s;econd joint, and
thus inducing a new &s;et of root-&s;cions to put forth, or tiller. See
Sect. XII. 3.</P>
<P>6. The garden plants, which are too vigorous, in &s;ituations
where there is a command of water, as in the gardens of warm
climates, &s;hould have le&s;s water derived to them, till the blo&s;&s;oms
appear; becau&s;e a greater quantity of moi&s;ture facilitates the pro|duction
of viviparous buds &s;o much as to retard that of oviparous
ones, and thus dimini&s;hes the quantity as well as retards the ri|pening
of the crop. But in the&s;e &s;ituations, as &s;oon as the blo&s;|&s;oms
appear, a greater &s;upply of water &s;hould be allowed, which
will contribute to nouri&s;h and enlarge them, as mentioned above;
as is practi&s;ed in &s;ome countries of the ea&s;t, where they do not
flood their rice-grounds, till they are in &s;lower. See Sect. XV.
3. 4. But le&s;s water is again required, when the &s;eed has arr|ived
at its full &s;ize, as before &s;poken of.</P>
<P>III. 1. <HI>To forward the ripening of &s;eeds.</HI> A due degree of
warmth and of dryne&s;s &s;eems to include the circum&s;tances prin|cipally
required. The warmth not only accelerates the various
&s;ecretions of vegetables by increa&s;ing their irritability and con&s;|equent
activity, but, after the mucilaginous, &s;tarchy, &s;accharine,
and oily matters are &s;ecreted into proper re&s;ervoirs, may contri|bute
perhaps chemically to their change into each other, or to
their greater perfection. And the dryne&s;s of the air, whether
hot or cold, is nece&s;&s;ary to give perfect ripene&s;s to &s;eeds; as
otherwi&s;e the due exhalation of the aqueous parts of the &s;ecreted
<PB N="406" REF="411">
fluids, which form the nutritive parts of &s;eeds, does not properly
proceed; and the &s;eed gathered in this condition is liable to mil|dew
in the barn or granary, or to become &s;hrivelled and wrinkled,
as it dries.</P>
<P>2. It is believed in Scotland, that even the fro&s;ty nights of
autumn contribute to ripen the late corps in that inclement cli|mate,
which &s;ome have a&s;cribed to the moonlight, but, which I
have indeed &s;u&s;pected, that the fro&s;t may in &s;ome mea&s;ure effect
by converting the mucilage of the grain &s;ooner into &s;tarch. This
I was induced to imagine by having ob&s;erved that bookbinder's
pa&s;te, made by boiling wheat-flour in water, lo&s;t its adhe&s;ion af|ter
having been frozen; and al&s;o from a culinary ob&s;ervation,
that when ice or &s;now is mingled with flour in&s;tead of water in
making pancakes, that it much improves them; the truth of
which I have heard boldly a&s;&s;erted, but never witne&s;&s;ed the expe|riment.
See Sect. VI. 3. 3.</P>
<P>There is neverthele&s;s an experiment related by Dr. Roebuck
in the Edinburgh Tran&s;actions, Vol. I. which &s;eems to &s;hew,
that the grains of oats continue to fill and to become heavier even
during the autumnal fro&s;ts; which may probably occur during the
&s;un&s;hine of the middle part of the day, as occurs in the vernal
fro&s;ts of this part of the country. In 1780 near Borrow&s;tone&s;s
the oats were green even in October, when the ice was three-fourths
of an inch thick. He &s;elected &s;everal &s;talks of oats of
nearly equal fulne&s;s, cut half of them, and marked the remain|der,
which continued fourteen days longer in the field; after be|ing
dry, the grains of each parcel were weighed; and eleven of
tho&s;e grains, which had remained in the field, weighed thirty of
tho&s;e which had been cut a fortnight &s;ooner.</P>
<P>This important experiment &s;hould teach our farmers not to cut
their peas and beans too early in inclement autumns; which
are &s;o frequently &s;een to become &s;hrunk and &s;hrivelled in the barn
or granary, and inclined to rot from deficient ripene&s;s, and con|&s;equent
&s;oftne&s;s or moi&s;ture; and thus contain much le&s;s flour in
proportion to the hu&s;k or bran.</P>
<P>3. The wheat produced after land has been much limed, is
believed to be thinner &s;kinned, and to yield more good meal,
than other wheat, and to make better bread. See Sect. X. 6. 7.
<PB N="407" REF="412">
On this account I &s;uppo&s;e one u&s;e of lime is to forward the ri|pening
of &s;eeds by converting their mucilage &s;ooner into &s;tarch or
oil; as according to the experiments of M. Permentier the
goodne&s;s of bread depends much on the quantity of &s;tarch con|tained
in it; who found, that if the &s;tarch taken from eight
pounds of raw potatoes, by grating them into cold water, was
mixed with eight pounds of boiled potatoes, as good bread might
be produced as from wheat flour. See Sect. VI. 3.</P>
<P>4. The &s;eeds of &s;ome plants, which al&s;o propagate them&s;elves
by bulbs at their roots, will not ripen in this climate naturally, as
the orchis; but are &s;aid to ripen, if the new bulb be cut off early
in the &s;ea&s;on; or if the propagation by their roots be retarded or
prevented by con&s;ining them in garden-pots, as the lily of the
valley; and it is probable, that the &s;eeds of potatoes might be
rendered more perfectly ripe, and in con&s;equence better for the
cultivation of new varieties; if the young roots were taken away
early in the &s;ea&s;on from that, which is to bear &s;eed; or if they
were confined in garden pots.</P>
<P>If the orchis could by the&s;e means be cultivated from &s;eed on
moi&s;t meadows or mora&s;&s;es, it might become a profitable article
of hu&s;bandry; as when it is &s;calded in boiling water, and the
peel rubbed off, it is &s;old by the name of &s;alep, and might become
a nutritive article of diet, like &s;ago and vermicelli, if it could
be propagated at le&s;s expence.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o probable, that Jeru&s;alem, or ground artichokes, he|lianthus
tubero&s;us, might be induced to ripen its &s;eeds in this
country, if the new roots from a few of the forwarde&s;t plants
were taken away early in the &s;ea&s;on, or if they were confined in
garden pots. And if this plant could be propagated by &s;eed, it
might make an u&s;eful product in agriculture, as hor&s;es are very
fond of the leaves, and &s;wine of the roots; both of which are
produced in great quantity; and as the latter contain much &s;ugar,
they mu&s;t be very nutritive; and in re&s;pect to their culinary u&s;e
are remarkably grateful to moi&s;t palates, as well as nutritive,
when cut into &s;lices, and baked in beef or mutton pies; but are
&s;aid to be flatulent in the bowels of tho&s;e who&s;e dige&s;tion is not
very powerful; a property which might be worthy attention,
<PB N="408" REF="413">
where the propen&s;ity to fermentation is required, as in making
bread with potatoes, or in the di&s;tillery.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o probable, that if the large new root-&s;uckers of other
perennial plants, which do not bear bulbous or tuberous roots, and
which are late in ripening their &s;eeds, or do not ripen them per|fectly
in this climate, were cut or torn off early in the &s;ea&s;on, as
of the rheum palmatum, palmated rhubarb, or rheum hybridum,
male rhubarb; or if their roots were confined in garden-pots, that
they might be more liable completely to ripen their re&s;pective
&s;eeds. See Sect. XV. 2. 4.</P>
<P>IV. 1. <HI>To generate the be&s;t $word$ of &s;eeds</HI> the mo&s;t healthy
plants mu&s;t be cho&s;en, and tho&s;e which are mo&s;t early in re&s;pect
to the &s;ea&s;on; the&s;e &s;hould be so in&s;ulated, as to have no weak
plants of the &s;ame &s;pecies, or even genus, in their vicinity, le&s;t
the fecundating du&s;t of weaker plants &s;hould be blown by the
winds upon the &s;tigmata of the &s;tronger, and thus produce a le&s;s
vigorous progeny.</P>
<P>Where new varieties are required, the male du&s;t of one good
variety, as of the nonp$$$il apple, &s;hould he &s;hed upon the &s;tig|mas
of another good variety, as of the golden-pippin; and it is
probable &s;ome new excellent variety might be thus generated.</P>
<P>Mr. Knight has given a curious experiment of his impregnat|ing
the &s;tigmas of the pea-blo&s;&s;oms of one variety with the farina
of another. He &s;ays, Treati&s;e of Apple and Pear, p. 42,
&startq;Blo&s;&s;oms of a &s;mall white garden-pea, in which the males had
previously been de&s;troyed, were impregnated with the farina of a
large clay-coloured kind with purple blo&s;&s;oms. The produce of
the &s;eeds thus obtained were of a dark grey colour, but the&s;e
having no fixed habits, were &s;oon changed by cultivation into a
numerous variety of very large and extremely luxuriant white
ones; which were not only much larger and more productive than
the original white ones, but the number of &s;eeds in each pod was
increa&s;ed from &s;even or eight to eight or nine, and not unfre|quently
to ten. The newly made grey kinds I found were ea&s;ily
made white again by impregnating their blo&s;&s;oms with the farina of
another white kind. In this experiment the &s;eeds, which grew
towards the point of the pod, and were by po&s;ition fir&s;t expo&s;ed
to the action of the male, would &s;ometimes produce &s;eeds like it
<PB N="409" REF="414">
in colour, whil&s;t tho&s;e at the other end would follow the female.</P>
<P>&startq;In other in&s;tances the whole produce of the pod would take
the colour of one or other of the parents; and I had once an in|&s;tance
in which two peas at one end of a pod produced white &s;eeds
like the male, two at the other end grey ones like the female, and
the central &s;eeds took the intermediate &s;hade, a clay colour.
Something very &s;imilar appears to take place in animals, which
produce many young ones at a birth, when the male and female are
of oppo&s;ite colours. From &s;ome very imperfect experiments I
have made, I am led to &s;u&s;pect that con&s;iderable advantages would
be found to ari&s;e from the u&s;e of new or regenerated varieties of
wheat, and the&s;e are ea&s;ily obtained, as this plant readily &s;ports in
varieties, whenever different kinds are &s;own together.&endq; See
Sect. VII. 2. 6. of this work.</P>
<P>2. The white and blue peas &s;own in fields as well as in gardens
&s;ometimes po&s;&s;e&s;s the property of becoming &s;oft by boiling, at
other times not. This circum&s;tance is &s;aid to depend on the na|ture
of the &s;oil, but has not yet been &s;ufficiently inve&s;tigated;
perhaps the greater or le&s;s maturity of the peas at the time of
reaping them may have more or le&s;s contributed to &s;ill their
fibrous cells or divi&s;ions with mucilage or &s;tarch. The greater or
le&s;s mealine&s;s produced by boiling potatoes &s;eems to be an analo|gous
circum&s;tance, and is thought by &s;ome to ari&s;e from the na|ture
of the &s;oil rather than from the &s;pecies or variety of the
planted root.</P>
<P>The mealine&s;s of &s;ome boiled potatoes, and the &s;oftne&s;s of
&s;ome boiled peas, may occa&s;ionally be affected by the acidity of
the &s;pring water, in which they are boiled; but is generally I
&s;uppo&s;e owing to the mucilage of &s;ome of them being more or
le&s;s coagulable by heat, than that of others. Something &s;imilar
to which obtains in animal mucus, as the cry&s;talline humour of
the eyes of fi&s;h become hard and opake by boiling; while the
&s;kins of animals, and the tendons of their feet, become a &s;oft
mucus or jelly by boiling; and &s;ome of the liquids, which are
found in the cells or cavities of the body in drop&s;ies, are ob&s;erv|ed
to coagulate by heat, and others to become more fluid. The
cau&s;es of this difference merits further enquiry.</P>
<P>V. 1. <HI>To collect good &s;eeds,</HI> according to the ob&s;ervations of
Mr. Cooper of Philadelphia, con&s;i&s;ts not in procuring new &s;eeds
<PB N="410" REF="415">
from di&s;tant places, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, but in &s;electing the
be&s;t &s;eeds and roots of his own; which though he has continually
&s;own or planted them in the &s;ame &s;oil, every article of his produce
is greatly &s;uperior to tho&s;e of any other per&s;on, who &s;upplies the
market, and they &s;eem &s;till in a &s;tate of improvement. He be|lieved
that no kind of ince&s;t would degenerate the breeds of ve|getables,
and therefore adopted the plan of Mr. Bakewell in Eng|land
in re&s;pect to quadrupeds, who continued to improve his flocks
and herds by the marriages of tho&s;e, in which the properties he
wi&s;hed to produce were mo&s;t con&s;picuous without regard to con|&s;anguinity
or ince&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Cooper was led to his pre&s;ent practice, which he began
more than forty years ago, by ob&s;erving that vegetables of all
kinds were very &s;ubject to change with re&s;pect to their time of
coming to maturity, and other properties, but that the be&s;t &s;eeds
never failed to produce the be&s;t plants. Among a great num|ber
of experiments he particularly mentions the following.</P>
<P>&startq;About the year 1746 his father procured &s;eeds of the
long watery &s;qua&s;h, and though they have been u&s;ed on the
farm ever &s;ince that time without any change, they are at this
time better than they were at the fir&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;His early peas were procured from London in the year 1756,
and though they have been planted on the &s;ame place
every &s;ea&s;on, they have been &s;o far from degenerating, that they
are preferable to what they were then. The &s;eeds of his a&s;pa|ragus
he had from New York in 1752, and though they have
been planted in the &s;ame manner, the plants are greatly im|proved.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is more particularly complained of, that potatoes dege|nerate,
when they are planted from the &s;ame roots in the &s;ame
place. At this Mr. Cooper &s;ays, he does not wonder, when it
is cu&s;tomary with farmers to &s;ell or con&s;ume the be&s;t, and to
plant from the refu&s;e; whereas having ob&s;erved that &s;ome of his
plants produced potatoes, that were larger, better &s;haped, and
in greater abundance than others, he took his roots from them
only; and the next &s;ea&s;on he found, that the produce was of
a quality &s;uperior to any, that he had ever had before. This
<PB N="411" REF="416">
practice he &s;till continues, and finds that he is abundantly re|warded
for his trouble.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Cooper is al&s;o careful to &s;ow the plants, from which
he rai&s;es his &s;eed, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from any others.
Thus, when his radi&s;hes are fit for u&s;e, he takes ten or twelve,
that he mo&s;t approves, and plants them at lea&s;t one hundred
yards from othesr, that blo&s;&s;om at the &s;ame time. In the &s;ame
manner he treats all his other plants, varying the circum&s;tances
according to their nature.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;About the year 1772 a friend of his &s;ent him a few grains
of a &s;mall kind of Indian corn, not larger than goo&s;e &s;hot, which
produced from eight to ten ears on a &s;talk. They were al&s;o
&s;mall, and he found, that few of them ripened before the fro&s;t.
Some of the large&s;t and earlie&s;t he &s;aved, and planted them be|tween
rows of a larger and earlier kind, and the produce was
much improved. He then planted from tho&s;e that had pro|duced
the greate&s;t number of the large&s;t ears, and that were the
fir&s;t ripe, and the next &s;ea&s;on the produce with re&s;pect to qua|lity
and quantity was preferable to any, that he had ever planted
before.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The common method of &s;aving &s;eed-corn by taking the
ears from the heap is attended, he &s;ays, with two di&s;advanta|ges;
one is the taking the large&s;t ears, of which in general only
one grows on a &s;talk, which le&s;&s;ens the produce; and the other
is taking ears that ripen at different times.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Many years ago Mr. Cooper renewed all the &s;eed of his
winter grain from a &s;ingle plant, which he had ob&s;erved to be
more productive, and of a better quality than the re&s;t; which
he is &s;ati&s;fied has been of great u&s;e. And he is of opinion,
that all kinds of garden vegetables may be improved by the me|thods
de&s;cribed above, particular care being taken that different
kinds of the &s;ame vegetables do not bloom at the &s;ame time
near together; &s;ince by this means they injure one another.&endq;

Letter from Dr. Prie&s;tley.</P>
<P>2. As the varieties of plants are believed to be produced by
different &s;oils and climates, which varieties will afterwards con|tinue
through many generations, even when the plants are re|moved
<PB N="412" REF="417">
to other &s;oils and climates, it mu&s;t be advantageous for
the agricultor to in&s;pect other crops as well as his own; and
thus wherever he can find a &s;uperior vegetation to collect &s;eeds
from it; which is more certain to improve his crops than an
indi&s;criminate change of &s;eed.</P>
<P>But where &s;eed-corn is purcha&s;ed without a previous ob&s;erva|tion
of its &s;uperior excellence, perhaps it would be more advan|tageous
to take that from better kinds of &s;oil, and from &s;omewhat
better climates; as the good habits acquired by &s;uch &s;eeds may
be continued long after their removal to inferior &s;ituations. And
on the contrary, care &s;hould be taken not to collect a change of
&s;eeds from wor&s;e climates or inferior &s;oils, unle&s;s the agricultor
is previou&s;ly certain that they are of a &s;uperior kind.</P>
<P>VI. 1 <HI>To determine the goodne&s;s of &s;eeds,</HI> the weighing a
given mea&s;ure of them may generally be e&s;teemed a criterion;
as it is known, that when &s;eeds are put into cold water, tho&s;e
which are le&s;s perfect are liable to &s;wim, and the &s;ound ones
to &s;ink; thus the imperfect &s;eeds of rye-gra&s;s and of clover
may be detected by throwing a &s;poonful of them into water;
but the &s;eeds of rye-gra&s;s are &s;aid to be frequently adulterated
by a mixture of the &s;eeds of twitch or dog's gra&s;s, which can
only be di&s;covered by an experienced eye. This even is &s;aid
to be a te&s;t of the goodne&s;s of malt; as tho&s;e grains, which are
not perfectly germinated, will &s;wim with one end upwards, I
&s;uppo&s;e the root end; and tho&s;e which are perfectly germinated
&s;wim on their &s;ide, whil&s;t the &s;ound ungerminated barley &s;inks
in water.</P>
<P>It is therefore a proper criterion of good &s;eed-wheat to ca&s;t
it into &s;alt and water, ju&s;t &s;o &s;aline as to float an egg; as the
more &s;alt is di&s;&s;olved in the water, the heavier it becomes; and
hence none but quite &s;ound grains of wheat will &s;ink in this
brine; and that which &s;wims is properly rejected. This rejec|tion
of the light grains by &s;teeping wheat in brine is probably
of greater con&s;equence to the ea&s;uing crop, than the adhe&s;ion
of any &s;alt to the grain, which has been believed to de&s;troy the
eggs of infects &s;uppo&s;ed to adhere to it, or to fertilize the
&s;oil.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="418">
2. The weight of a given mea&s;ure of corn will al&s;o with con|&s;iderable
certainty di&s;cover the quantity of hu&s;k or bran contain|ed
in it, compared to the quantity of flour; as that grain, which
is cut too early, or which is otherwi&s;e not quite ripe, as hap|pens
in wet &s;ea&s;ons, &s;hrinks in the barn or granary, and becomes
wrinkled, and has thus a greater proportion of &s;kin or bran,
than that which has been more perfectly ripened, and will hence
weigh lighter in proportion.</P>
<P>A te&s;t of this kind may enable us to determine whether peas
and beans, or oats, are preferable in re&s;pect to economy as pro|vender
for hor&s;es. A &s;trike or bu&s;hel of oats weighs perhaps
forty pounds, and a &s;trike or bu&s;hel of peas and beans perhaps
&s;ixty pounds; and as the &s;kin of peas and beans is much le&s;s in
quantity than that of oats, I &s;uppo&s;e there may be at lea&s;t fifteen
pounds of flour more in a &s;trike of peas and beans than in a &s;trike
of oats. There is al&s;o rea&s;on to believe, that the flour of
beans is more nutritive than that of oats, as appears in the fat|tening
of hogs; whence according to the re&s;pective prices of the&s;e
two articles I &s;u&s;pect, that peas and beans generally &s;upply a
cheaper provender for hor&s;es than oats, as well as for other
dome&s;tic animals.</P>
<P>But as the flour of peas and beans is more oily, I believe,
than that of oats, it may in general be &s;omewhat more difficult
of dige&s;tion; hence when a hor&s;e has taken a &s;tomach full of
peas and beans alone, he may be le&s;s active for an hour or two,
as his &s;trength will be more employed in the dige&s;tion of them,
than when he has taken a &s;tomach full of oats. According to
the experiment of a German phy&s;ician, who gave to two dogs,
which had been kept a day fa&s;ting, a large quantity of fle&s;h-food;
and then taking one of them into the fields hunted him with
great activity for three or four hours, and left the other by the
fire. An emetic was then given to each of them, and the food
of the &s;leeping dog was found perfectly dige&s;ted, whil&s;t that
of the hunted one had undergone but little alteration.</P>
<P>Hence it may be found advi&s;eable to mix bran of wheat with
the peas and beans, a food of le&s;s nutriment, but of ea&s;ier di|ge&s;tion;
or to let the hor&s;es eat before or after them the coar&s;e
tu&s;&s;ocks of &s;our gra&s;s, which remain in moi&s;t pa&s;tures in the win|ter;
or la&s;tly, to mix finely cut &s;traw with them.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="419">
3. Another way of di&s;tingui&s;hing light corn from heavy is
by winnowing; as the &s;urface of the light grains being greater
in proportion to their &s;olid contents, they will be carried further
by the current of air, which is produced by the van; though the
heavy grains would roll further on the floor after rolling down
a grate to &s;eparate the du&s;t; becau&s;e their vis inertiae would
carry them further, after they are put in motion; and their &s;ur|faces
would be re&s;i&s;ted by the air no more than tho&s;e of the
lighter grains.</P>
<P>4. Finally, there is rea&s;on to believe that a progre&s;&s;ive im|provement
of many &s;eeds exi&s;ts during the warmer days of
winter in our granaries, which probably con&s;i&s;ts in the proce&s;s
of the conver&s;ion of mucilage into &s;tarch; in the &s;ame manner
as the har&s;h juices of crab-apples, and of au&s;tere pears, are con|tinually
changing into &s;ugar during the winter; both which
proce&s;&s;es are probably in part chemical, like the &s;low but per|petual
change of &s;ugar into vinous &s;pirit, when the juices of
&s;weeter apples and pears, or grapes, are put into bottles in the

<P>This improvement of wheat, and of barley, and of oats, is
well known to the baker, the malt&s;ter, and the horse-dealer;
as better bread is made from old wheat, and barley is converted
into better malt in the vernal months; and hor&s;es are believed
to thrive better, and to po&s;&s;e&s;s more vigour, when they are fed
with old than with new oats.</P>
<P>VII. 1. <HI>The pre&s;ervation of &s;eeds</HI> next demands our atten|tion.
Tho&s;e &s;eeds which are liable to lie upon the ground, as
peas and corn, when thrown down by &s;tormy or wet &s;ea&s;ons,
&s;hould be gathered rather earlier; le&s;t they &s;hould begin to ger|minate,
as they lie upon the ground, and would hence become
a kind of malt after drying. Other &s;eeds &s;hould be gathered,
before they would &s;pontaneou&s;ly fall from their pericarps, to
prevent the lo&s;s which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e en&s;ue in the reaping, or
mowing, and carrying them to the barn, which often amounts
to as much as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ow the land, which produced
it, as well as to &s;upply the depredations of birds, in&s;ects, and
vermin.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="420">
Mon&s;. B. G. Sage accu&s;es the farmers of &s;ome parts of France
of collecting their wheat with many green weeds immediately
after reaping it, and pre&s;&s;ing it clo&s;e together in their barns;
by which the &s;tack undergoes a fermentation with great heat
like &s;ome hay &s;tacks; and that the corn is by this fermentation
killed, and will not grow when &s;own like hay-&s;eeds from a fer|mented
hay-&s;tack, mentioned in Sect. X. 11. 7; and al&s;o that
the gluten, or vegeto-animal matter of the corn, is de&s;troyed;
and it on that account makes le&s;s agreeable and le&s;s whole&s;ome
bread; and la&s;tly, that the &s;traw is much injured by becoming
mouldy. Journal de Phy&s;ique, Sep. 1794.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. B. G. Sage adds, that the following proce&s;s will di&s;|cover,
whether wheat has been thus injured, which may be in|tere&s;ting
both to the baker, and wheat-buyer, who wants it for
&s;eed-wheat. Make a pa&s;te with flour and water, then wa&s;h it
with your hands under water, which mu&s;t be frequently chang|ed,
till it no longer becomes di&s;coloured. The &s;ub&s;tance remain|ing
the hands is the gluten; if the corn be good, this is ela&s;tic,
and will contract when drawn out; if the corn has begun to
heat, it is brittle; if the corn has fermented, none of the glu|ten
will be obtained.</P>
<P>In this country, where corn is &s;eldom cut too early, or pre&s;|&s;ed
together on the &s;tack, the principal circum&s;tance required is
to keep it dry; as the &s;traw is not liable to ferment like new hay
made with young gra&s;s, which contains &s;ugar at every joint of
the &s;tem. To pre&s;erve a &s;tack of wheat dry, a good cover of
thatch may &s;eem &s;ufficient; but as this is liable to injury by
vermin, it would be an additional &s;ecurity, if at the time of mak|ing
the &s;tack the &s;heaves were laid highe&s;t in the middle, and
lower on every &s;ide, &s;o that if any wet &s;hould find its way into
the &s;tack, it might drain onwards along the &s;traw of the &s;heaves,
which would thus act like thatch throughout the whole &s;tack.</P>
<P>There are in&s;tances of great durability of &s;eeds, which have
been pre&s;erved dry, and &s;ecured from either &s;o great heat or &s;o
great cold, as might de&s;troy their life or organi&s;m. Thus there
is an account of the &s;eeds of Indian wheat, which grew well in
a hot-hou&s;e after having been kept thirty-four years, as was
accurately a&s;cretained. Bath Society, Vol. V. p. 464. And
<PB N="416" REF="421">
it has been lately a&s;&s;erted, that many &s;eeds of more than a hun|dred
years old, which were found in &s;ome old herbarium at
Vienna, have been made to germinate by the u&s;e of oxygenated
muriatic acid and water. Philo&s;. Magaz. But if the organic
life of a &s;eed be de&s;troyed by fro&s;t, or fire, or mechanic injury,
putrefaction &s;ucceeds, and decompo&s;ition; as when the organic
life of an egg is de&s;troyed by violently agitating it, it is known
&s;oon to putrefy.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve &s;eeds in barns or granaries our principal attention
&s;hould be fir&s;t to make them dry; and &s;econdly to keep them
dry; becau&s;e no &s;eeds can vegetate without moi&s;ture. The art
of drying mo&s;t &s;eeds mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in duly ventilating them, e&s;pe|cially
on dry days; which may be done by frequently turning
over the heaps of them; and to pre&s;erve them dry in this cli|mate
the door and windows of granaries &s;hould open to the &s;outh
to receive the warmth of the &s;un, with apertures round the build|ing
for &s;ufficient ventilation; which mu&s;t be prevented from
admitting rain or &s;now by &s;heltering boards on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>The heaps of corn &s;hould be &s;urrounded with boards to keep
them from contact with brick or &s;tone walls; which, when
warm moi&s;t &s;outh-we&s;t winds &s;ucceed cold north-ea&s;t winds,
are liable to precipitate the moi&s;ture from the atmo&s;phere by
their coldne&s;s, and to communicate it to all bodies in contact
with them. For a &s;imilar purpo&s;e in &s;tables &s;ome have put
up a tall wooden trunk from the chamber to the room below,
three or four feet &s;quare, and ten or twelve feet high, with a
&s;liding valve to draw out the corn below, which is poured in
at the top; in three or four places a tin or wooden pipe full of
holes is made to pa&s;s horizontally through the box to give air
to the corn, the whole of which, when any of it is drawn out
below, is moved in de&s;cending; and new &s;urfaces of corn are
applied to the air-holes of the horizontal tubes.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;ecure way of pre&s;erving a great quantity of wheat,
according to Mr. Tull, is by gently drying it on a hair-cloth in
a malt-kiln, with no other fuel but clean &s;traw, and no greater
heat than that of the &s;un&s;hine. In this &s;ituation the wheat re|mained
from four hours to twelve hours, according to the pre|vious
dampne&s;s of it. Mr. Tull knew a farmer in Oxfordshire
<PB N="417" REF="422">
who purcha&s;ed wheat, when it was cheap, and kept it by thus
drying it for many years, and made a large fortune by &s;elling it
again in dearer &s;ea&s;ons. The life of the &s;eed was not de&s;troyed
by this proce&s;s; as he a&s;&s;erts, that &s;ome of it grew, which had
been kept in this manner &s;even years; whereas in drying pota|toes
on a malt-kiln &s;o great heat was employed as to de&s;troy
their life, and violent putrefaction en&s;ued, as mentioned in Sect.
X. 9. 2.</P>
<P>2. A due ventilation al&s;o, where corn is kept in the common
warmth of the atmo&s;phere in this climate, is nece&s;&s;ary, except
in &s;ea&s;ons of fro&s;t, and al&s;o the admi&s;&s;ion of light; as otherwi&s;e
the vegetable mucor, called mould, is liable to grow upon the
corn, and injure it; as this mucor like &s;ome other fungu&s;es
will grow, where there is little or no change of air, and with|out
light, as in cellars, if there be &s;ufficient moi&s;ture and
warmth.</P>
<P>3. Another method of pre&s;erving &s;eeds may con&s;i&s;t &s;e|cluding
them from heat, as in granaries beneath the &s;oil; which
are &s;o deep or &s;o well covered with earth, as not to be affected
by the difference of &s;ea&s;ons. Thus there have been in&s;tances
of mu&s;tard-&s;eed producing a crop on digging up earth, which
had not been removed for many years, and, as was believed,
even for ages. And in ice-hou&s;es it is probable, that not only
&s;eeds might be long pre&s;erved, but perhaps fruits al&s;o; if they
were afterwards very gradually thawed by putting them into
cold water, that they might not be de&s;troyed by the too great
&s;timulus of &s;udden heat, as mentioned in Sect. XV. 4. 1.</P>
<P>4. Where it has been nece&s;&s;ary &s;uddenly to collect and to
pre&s;erve great heaps of corn without &s;helter for the provi&s;ion of
armies, &s;ome have moderately moi&s;tened the upper &s;urface of the
heap daily, which has occa&s;ioned the upper grains to grow, and
thus to produce a &s;ward or turf over tho&s;e below; which, it is
&s;aid, has thus pre&s;erved the lower part of the magazine. But
in re&s;pect to granaries for the purpo&s;e of laying up very large
quantities of grain to prevent famines in &s;carce years, I &s;uppo&s;e
the &s;tacks of covetous farmers, who keep their corn in cheap
years, hoping to &s;ell it at a better price in &s;carce ones, is a
more certain method, and a cheaper one to the public, to keep
<PB N="418" REF="423">
up a &s;ufficient &s;tock of corn, than by any other experiment that
can be devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>5. Gardeners in general prefer new &s;eeds to old for their
principal crops, as they are believed to come up &s;ooner, and
with greater certainty, and to grow more luxuriantly. &startq;But
peas and beans of a year old,&endq; Mr. Mar&s;hall ob&s;erves, &startq;are by
&s;ome preferred to new,&endq; as not &s;o likely to run to &s;traw. And
cucumbers and melons are be&s;t to be &s;everal years old, in order
of their &s;hooting le&s;s vigorou&s;ly, and thence becoming more
fruitful. But this principle is carried too far by &s;ome gardeners,
who &s;ay the&s;e &s;eeds cannot be too old, and will allow ten years
to be within bounds; three for cucumbers, and four for melons,
however is age enough.</P>
<P>&startq;As to the age of &s;eeds, at which they may be &s;own, it is
uncertain, and depends much upon how they are kept; tho&s;e
of cucumbers and melons are good a long time, becau&s;e very
carefully pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>&startq;Peas and beans will germinate very well at &s;even years of
age; but the &s;eeds of lettuces and kidney-beans, and &s;ome
others, are not to be depended upon after a year or two; and
generally &s;peaking the &s;maller &s;eeds are of the lea&s;t duration.&endq;
Mar&s;hall on Gardening.</P>
<P>6. Where &s;eeds of a peri&s;hable nature are to be carried to,
or brought from, di&s;tant countries, I &s;u&s;pect that covering them
in &s;ugar would be the mo&s;t certain and &s;alutary method of pre|&s;erving
them; and even, that fle&s;h meat cut into thin &s;lices,
and covered with &s;ugar, or &s;yrup, or treacle, would be better
pre&s;erved than in brine, and afford a much more &s;alutary nouri&s;h|ment
to our &s;ailors.</P>
<P>Since I wrote the above I have &s;een a paper in the Tran&s;ac|tions
of the Society of Arts, Vol. XVI. from Mr. Sneyde of
Belmont in Stafford&s;hire, who having ob&s;erved &s;ome &s;eeds,
which came accidentally among&s;t rai&s;ins, to grow readily, di|rected
many &s;eeds to be &s;ent from the We&s;t Indies covered with
rai&s;ins, and others in &s;ugar, and others in the u&s;ual manner of
&s;ending them, and found, that tho&s;e immer&s;ed in &s;ugar or co|vered
with rai&s;ins both looked well, and grew readily; whereas
many of the others would not vegetate.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="424">
Since the powder of fre&s;h burnt charcoal is known &s;o power|fully
to ab&s;orb all putrid vapours, it is probable the &s;eeds mixed
with and covered with charcoal du&s;t, which has been recently
burnt, or not long expo&s;ed to the air, might be &s;ucce&s;sfully em|ployed
for the pre&s;ervation of &s;eeds either in long voyages, or
in dome&s;tic granaries.</P>
<P>VIII. 1. <HI>To &s;ow &s;eeds advantageou&s;ly</HI> it is probable, that
tho&s;e of our native plants might be &s;uffered to drop on the &s;ur|face
of the earth in the autumn, as they fall from their parent
plants, covered only by their deciduous leaves; in which &s;itua|tion
their fruit might contribute to nouri&s;h them, as our crabs
and &s;loes; or defend them from in&s;ects, as the acrid hu&s;k of the
walnut; or from birds, as the hard &s;tones or &s;hells of nuts and
cherries, &s;ince this is the proce&s;s of nature.</P>
<P>But when the &s;eeds brought originally from other climates are
to be &s;own, an attention is required to the circum&s;tance of &s;ea|&s;on
and of &s;oil. Tho&s;e, which will ripen their &s;eeds in the &s;ame
year, are to be &s;owed in the early &s;pring, and covered lightly
with earth to pre&s;erve them from birds and in&s;ects; and &s;hould
be buried thus beneath the &s;oil, &s;oon after it has been ploughed
or dug, as its inter&s;tices are then replete with atmo&s;pheric air;
which may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;timulate into elevation the plume of
the embryon plant; as the moi&s;ture of the earth is nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;timulate the root into its elongation downwards.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;eeds neverthele&s;s, which will not perfect their vegeta|tion
in the &s;ame year, mu&s;t be &s;own in the early autumn; and
though all &s;eeds vegetate better, when placed but a little
beneath the &s;urface of the &s;oil, as one inch, becau&s;e they have
then a better &s;upply of atmo&s;pheric air, which may be nece&s;&s;ary
for their fir&s;t growth, before they have acquired leaves above
ground; yet as many foreign &s;eeds may not be &s;ufficiently hardy
to bear our inclement winters, it may be nece&s;&s;ary, as &s;ome be|lieve,
to bury them an inch and a half, or two inches, deep in
the &s;oil, to prevent the fro&s;ts from doing them injury, as
well as to pre&s;erve them from the depredation of birds. And the drill
&s;emination, or &s;owing all kinds of &s;eeds in rows, is the mo&s;t con|venient
method for &s;owing them at a determined depth, and al&s;o
<PB N="420" REF="425">
for the purpo&s;e of keeping the young plants clear from weeds by
the more ea&s;y application of the hoe.</P>
<P>To &s;ow many &s;eeds earlier than is u&s;ually practi&s;ed is much
recommended. There is a paper by Lord Orford in Mr.
Young's Annals of Agriculture, Vol. IX. p. 385, who &s;eems
to have found con&s;iderable advantage by &s;owing barley &s;o early
as the &s;eventh of February, three and a half bu&s;hels on an acre.
But as much moi&s;ture with or without &s;ub&s;equent fro&s;t is more
liable to de&s;troy the embryon in its very early &s;tate in the &s;eed,
than after it has &s;hot out roots and a &s;ummit, and thus acquired
&s;ome habits of life; this early &s;owing mu&s;t &s;ometimes be practi&s;ed
with caution. Seeds may neverthele&s;s be &s;own &s;till earlier in
hot-hou&s;es, or in warm &s;ituations, as peas, beans, wheat, and
may be afterwards tran&s;planted in the vernal months with &s;afety
and advantage. See Sect. X. 3. 6.</P>
<P>The difficulty of determining the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing &s;eeds
in the &s;pring, owing to the variation of the weather in the &s;ame la|titude,
as well as in laying down the exact &s;ea&s;ons for &s;owing in
different latitudes, occa&s;ioned Linneus to con&s;truct, what he
terms a calendar of Flora; which was afterwards adapted to this
climate by Stillingfleet; which con&s;i&s;ted in ob&s;erving the fir&s;t ap|pearance
of the root &s;cions, or flowers of the uncultivated native
vegetables; with directions to &s;ow the cerealia, or harve&s;t &s;eeds,
when &s;uch plants or flowers became vi&s;ible. By attention to
&s;uch ob&s;ervations on the uncultivated native plants in many cli|mates,
it is probable, that ingenious tables might be produced,
which might direct the be&s;t time of &s;owing the u&s;eful &s;eeds in all
latitudes, and in all &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Another table of the climates, where plants grow naturally,
and of their native &s;ituations in re&s;pect to moi&s;ture or dryne&s;s,
hill or valley, with the kind of &s;oil where they were originally
found, might al&s;o contribute to their &s;ucce&s;sful cultivation.</P>
<P>2. In the gardens near large towns, where the land is more va|luable
and better manured, gardeners &s;ometimes &s;ow two or three
kinds of &s;eeds on the &s;ame ground for the purpo&s;e of economy.
Thus Mr. Mar&s;hall ob&s;erves, that &startq;on the &s;ame ground they &s;ow
radi&s;hes, lettuces, and carrots; the radi&s;hes are drawn young
for the table, the lettuces to plant out, and a &s;ufficient crop of
<PB N="421" REF="426">
carrots is left; for carrots, if you wi&s;h them to be large, &s;hould
not grow very near to each other.&endq;</P>
<P>In defence of this mode of culture it is &s;aid, if one crop fails,
the others may do well, and there is no lo&s;s of ground or time;
and if all &s;ucceed, they do very well. Radi&s;hes and &s;pinach
are commonly &s;own together by the common gardeners, and
many manoeuvres of inter-cropping are made by them, as the
&s;owing or planting between rows of vegetables that are wide
a&s;under, or pre&s;ently to come off, or in the alleys of things cul|tivated
on beds.</P>
<P>&startq;Thus if a piece of hor&s;e-radi&s;h be new planted, it may be
top-cropped with radi&s;hes or &s;pinach, &amp;c.; or if a piece of pot|atoes
be planted wide, a bean may be put in between each &s;et in
every or every other row; a thin crop of onions upon new a&s;pa|ragus
beds, is a common practice, drawing them young from
about the plants.&endq; Introduc. to Gardening. Rivington.</P>
<P>The farmer likewi&s;e, in the cultivation of gra&s;&s;es for feeding
&s;heep, finds an advantage in &s;owing a mixture of &s;eeds on the
&s;ame ground, as rye-gra&s;s, trefoil and clover, which are &s;aid to
&s;ucceed each other in re&s;pect to the production are maturity of
their herbage, as in Sect. XVIII. 1. 1. And for the purpo&s;e
of preventing &s;mut it may be u&s;eful, as I have before ob&s;erved,
to &s;ow in the &s;ame ground in &s;eparate rows two kinds of wheat,
one of a forwarder nature than the other; whence if the farina
of one kind &s;hould be injured by wet weather, that of the other
may impregnate the ears of both. The two kinds of wheat re|commended
are bearded wheat and &s;mooth-headed wheat, which
are called by farmers cone wheat and Lammas wheat; of both
of which there are many varieties, and it is a&s;&s;erted that one
third of cone wheat is frequently &s;owed with two thirds of
Lammas wheat, and that the crops are much &s;uperior to either
of them &s;eparately. Hall's Encyclop. Art. Agriculture.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to kinds of &s;oil tho&s;e &s;hould be cho&s;en, which have
been found by ob&s;ervation to &s;uit particular &s;eeds, both in regard
to their nutritive properties, and the moi&s;ture and warmth of
their &s;ituations. And for tho&s;e &s;eeds, which produce tuberous
roots within the earth previous to their flowering, as potatoes,
<PB N="422" REF="427">
par&s;nips, radi&s;hes, a &s;oil of le&s;s cohe&s;ion &s;hould be found or pre|pared.</P>
<P>3. Add to this, that there are &s;ome &s;eeds, as tho&s;e of carrots,
that are &s;o difficult to be di&s;&s;eminated in uniform quantities, that
it has been cu&s;tomary to mix them previou&s;ly with &s;and or garden
mould, for the purpo&s;e of giving them weight, or bulk, or to
detach them from each other. And &s;ome even &s;uffer them to
begin to put forth their roots in &s;uch a mixture of moi&s;t &s;and or
garden mould for the purpo&s;e of more regularly di&s;per&s;ing them.</P>
<P>In dry &s;ea&s;ons the &s;oaking &s;eeds in water, a day or two before
committing them to the ground, will forward their growth, as
well as by artificially watering the ground before or after &s;owing
them; and the &s;oaking them in a &s;olution of &s;alt and water may
have another advantage of giving an opportunity of rejecting
the light &s;eeds, which float, and perhaps of de&s;troying &s;ome in|&s;ects
which may adhere to them; the &s;prinkling &s;ome kinds of
feed with lime may al&s;o be of advantage for the purpo&s;e of de|&s;troying
in&s;ects, if &s;uch adhere to them, and of attracting
moi&s;ture from the air, or lower parts of the earth, or for its
other u&s;eful properties; but where the &s;eed, &s;oil, and &s;ea&s;on are
adapted to each other, none of the&s;e condiments are required.</P>
<P>It may neverthele&s;s on other accounts be very advantageous to
&s;teep many kinds of grain in the black liquor, which oozes from
manure heaps. Mr. Chappel in the papers of the Bath Society,
found great benefit by &s;teeping barley in the fluid above men|tioned
for twenty four hours, and &s;kimming off the light grains.
On taking it out of the water he mixed wood-a&s;hes &s;ifted with
the grain to make it &s;pread regularly, and obtained a much finer
crop, than from the &s;ame corn &s;own without preparation. To
this we may add, that to &s;teep the &s;eed in a &s;olution of dung in
water, as in the draining from a dunghill, is believed in China
both to forward the growth of the plant, and to defend it from
variety of in&s;ects, according to the information given to &s;ir G.
Staunton.</P>
<P>There is an old proverb, &startq;&s;ow dry and &s;et wet;&endq; but where
the earth has been lately turned over by the plough or &s;pade,
there can be no bad con&s;equence from &s;owing during rain in ge|neral;
but in &s;ome clay grounds much &s;oftened by rain, if &s;eed
<PB N="423" REF="428">
be put into holes, and a dry &s;ea&s;on &s;ucceeds, an impenetrable
cru&s;t may &s;upervene by the exhalation of the water, and the &s;et|ting,
as it is called, of the clay; but even this could not fre|quently
occur, when &s;eeds are &s;own in the moi&s;t weather of the
autumnal months; but generally in both ca&s;es the growth of the
&s;eed would be forwarded by the moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>4. Where the fruit, which &s;urrounds any kind of &s;eeds, can
be &s;owed along with them, it may an&s;wer &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e.
Thus the fruit of crabs, quinces, and &s;ome hard pears, will lie
all the winter uninjured covered only with their autumnal leaves,
and will contribute much to nouri&s;h their germinating &s;eeds in
the &s;pring. So the holly-berry and the ivy-berry remain du|ring
the winter months uninjured by the rains or fro&s;ts, and un|devoured
by birds or in&s;ects, and contribute to nouri&s;h their ger|minating
&s;eeds, when they fall on the ground in the &s;pring. The
acrid hu&s;k of walnuts &s;owed along with them pre&s;erves the
&s;weet kernel from the attack of in&s;ects; the &s;ame mu&s;t be the u&s;e
of the acrid oil of the ca&s;hew-nut. The hawthorn po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
both a nutritive covering and a hard &s;hell for the above purpo&s;es;
and the &s;eeds of ro&s;es are armed with &s;tiff pointed bri&s;tles, as
well as furni&s;hed with a nutritious fruit, &s;o long known as an
agreeable con&s;erve in the &s;hops of medicine, con&s;erva cyno&s;bati;
the former con&s;titutes a defence again&s;t in&s;ects, and the latter
&s;upplies a re&s;ervoir of nutriment for the germinating &s;eeds.</P>
<P>5. To this &s;hould be added, that in our &s;hort and cold &s;um|mers
the viviparous buds of &s;ome vegetables are too luxuriant,
and do not produce oviparous buds &s;oon enough to ripen their
&s;eeds, as melons and cucumbers, and many other plants, in
tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons which are moi&s;ter than common. It is believed,
that by wa&s;hing the &s;eeds of melons and cucumbers from the
&s;accharine and mucilaginous matter of their fruit, and by keep|ing
the &s;eed three or four years before it is u&s;ed, that the vivi|parous
buds become le&s;s vigorous, and the oviparous ones more
numerous, and forwarder in their flowering; and for the pro|duction
of earlier as well as of larger crops all &s;uch luxuriant
vegetables &s;hould be &s;own early in the vernal &s;ea&s;on, or in the
antumnal months, if they are not too tender to bear the winter

<HEAD>IX. Que&s;tion concerning general enclo&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>The political advantage or di&s;advantage of the general enclo|&s;ure
of a country belongs to this place, as it more particularly
affects the production of the cerealia, or corn-agriculture.</P>
<P>There can certainly be no objection to the enclo&s;ure of com|mons,
or at lea&s;t to the divi&s;ion of them into private property,
as they are believed to produce more than tenfold the quantity
of &s;u&s;tenance to mankind, if they are employed in agriculture,
or even in pa&s;turage, than by nouri&s;hing a few gee&s;e, &s;heep, or
deer, in their uncultivated &s;tate covered with fern, heath, or gor&s;e.</P>
<P>2. The advantage of enclo&s;ing pa&s;ture-lands, or meadows,
can not be doubted; as the management of fattening cattle, of
milch-cows, &s;heep, and hor&s;es, becomes &s;o much ea&s;ier; as well
as the more convenient u&s;e of the aftermath, when the hay is carried away.</P>
<P>3. The lands al&s;o appropriated to the production of garden
vegetables and fruit, as well as to the production of other pe|rennial
plants, which are u&s;ed in the arts, as hemp, flax, madder,
woad, rhubarb; and of the e&s;culent roots or herbage rai&s;ed for
the con&s;umption of cattle, as turnips, potatoes, carrots, cabbages,
certainly require to be enclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>4. The political que&s;tion therefore finally concerns only the
arable lands, and a&s;ks &s;imply, whether a general enclo&s;ure of
arable lands be favourable or unfavourable to the population, and
con&s;equent pro&s;perity of the country, which mu&s;t depend on
the comparative quantity of nutritive provi&s;ion, which is likely
to be produced from the different modes of its cultivation.</P>
<P>Now as pa&s;turage requires fewer hands in the management of
it, and le&s;s art and attention to conduct it, than agriculture;
and as its products in fle&s;h, chee&s;e, butter, take a higher com|parative
price at market, and are articles of greater luxury, than
the products of arable land in corn, we may conclude, that pa&s;|turage
will prevail in all enclo&s;ed provinces over agriculture.
And as perhaps tenfold the numbers of mankind can be &s;up|ported
by the corn produced on an hundred acres of land, than
on the animal food which can be rai&s;ed from it, it follows, that
<PB N="425" REF="430">
an enclo&s;ed province will afford &s;u&s;tenance to a much &s;maller
population; and as the number of inhabitants of a country de|pends
on the ea&s;e, with which parents can procure &s;u&s;tenance
for their families, marriages will become fewer, and the peo|ple
decrea&s;e, when an arable country is converted into pa&s;tur|age.</P>
<P>This la&s;t circum&s;tance appears already to operate in the&s;e
realms, &s;ince about half a century ago much corn was exported
annually, but for &s;everal years la&s;t pa&s;t great quantities of it
have been annually imported for our own &s;u&s;tenance; and that
even though potatoes are much cultivated, and mu&s;t therefore
le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption of grain, and the ungraceful fa&s;hion of
covering the head with wheat-flour is much dimini&s;hed. Is
this to be &s;olely a&s;cribed to the numerous enclo&s;ures of arable
lands, or in part to the con&s;umption of corn in the di&s;tille|ries?</P>
<P>One very important con&s;equence of any country producing
a greater quantity of corn, than it con&s;umes, and of thence ex|porting
it to foreign nations, even by means of a bounty, con|&s;i&s;ts
in its certainty of preventing famine, the mo&s;t dreadful of
human calamities; as in years of &s;carcity the &s;tream of export|tation
can be &s;topped, and produce an ample &s;upply by its &s;tag|nation
at home.</P>
<P>Hence when a great part of any tract of country becomes em|ployed
in pa&s;turage in&s;tead of agriculture, the inhabitants will
become con&s;umers of fle&s;h in&s;tead of con&s;umers of grain,
and will con&s;equently decrea&s;e in number from the want of &s;ufficient
&s;u&s;tenance. Be&s;ides which the people of agriculture are more
active and robu&s;t than the people of pa&s;turage, and more inge|nious
in the invention and u&s;e of machines nece&s;&s;ary for the more
artful cultivation of the &s;oil, as well as more numerous, and
will con&s;equently become &s;uperior to them in arms and
arts, and may in proce&s;s of time conquer them; which reminds us of the
Egyptian Dyna&s;ty of Shepherd-kings, who were &s;ubdued by
their agricultural rivals; and al&s;o of the allegorical hi&s;tory of
Cain &s;laying Abel, which were probably the names of two po|litical
hieroglyphic figures repre&s;enting the ages of pa&s;turage and
of agriculture before the invention of letters.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="431">
It mu&s;t hence certainly be an object of good policy to encour|age
agriculture in preference to pa&s;turage, which in this country
might be effected by preventing the enclo&s;ure of arable lands,
and al&s;o of tho&s;e parts of commons, which are be&s;t adapted to
the growth of corn; though the whole might be advantageou&s;ly
divided into private property. Unle&s;s &s;ome other means could
be devi&s;ed of preventing a nation from becoming too carnivorous,
or of duly promoting the cultivation of grain, the former of
which was heretofore produced by religious fa&s;t-days twice a
week, and the latter by bounties on the exportation of corn.
To which might be added a total prohibition of the de&s;tructive
manufactory of grain into &s;pirits, or into &s;trong ale, and thus
converting the natural nutriment of mankind into a chemical
poi&s;on, and thus thinning the ranks of &s;ociety both by le&s;&s;ening
their quantity of food, and &s;hortening their lives by di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In many villages, where much arable lands have been lately
enclo&s;ed, the numbers of labouring people have quickly been
much dimini&s;hed both by the &s;carcity of food, and want of
employment.</P>
<Q><L>Wor&s;e fares the land, to ha&s;tening ills a prey,</L>
<L>Where wealth accumulates, but men decay;</L>

<P>Mankind neverthele&s;s &s;eems by nature to be de&s;igned to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t
on both vegetable and animal nutriment, which appears from,
the length of his inte&s;tines, which like tho&s;e of &s;wine are much
longer than the inte&s;tines of carnivorous animals, and much
&s;horter than tho&s;e of the vegetable eaters; and which al&s;o ap|pears
from the &s;tructure of his teeth, which partakes of the &s;truc|ture
of tho&s;e of the carnivorous and phytivorous animals; and
la&s;tly, becau&s;e tho&s;e people, who live &s;olely on vegetables, as
the Gentoo tribes, and tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;olely on animals,
as the fi&s;h-eaters of the northern latitudes, are undoubtedly a
feebler generation than tho&s;e of this country, who exi&s;t on a
<PB N="427" REF="432">
mixture of both. A due proportion therefore of the two kinds
of nouri&s;hment, &s;uch as perhaps at pre&s;ent exi&s;ts, or lately did
exi&s;t, in this nation, mu&s;t be decidedly the be&s;t; the pre&s;erva|tion

4. Art to pre&s;erve roots. Keep them alive, between 32 and 48

<P>As the barks of trees are compo&s;ed of a congeries of the long
caudexes of the individual buds, which con&s;i&s;t of the ab&s;orbent
ve&s;&s;els, which imbibe nutriment from the earth, and of the arte|ries
and veins, which &s;upply nutriment to the growing vegetable;
of the glands, which &s;ecrete from the vegetable blood the vari|ous
acrid, a&s;tringent, or narcotic, juices to defend them from
the depredation of in&s;ects; and the various mucilaginous, oily,
or &s;accharine, materials for the nouri&s;hment of their embryon
buds; and la&s;tly, of the organs of reproduction. There exi&s;ts
the &s;tronge&s;t analogy between the barks of the trunks of trees,
and of their roots, in every re&s;pect; except that the former
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a cuticle adapted to the contact of the dry atmo&s;phere,
and the latter a cuticle adapted to the contact of the moi&s;t
earth, which differ from each other like the external &s;kin, and
the mucous membranes of animals. And finally, as the&s;e long
caudexes of the buds of trees, which form the filaments of the
bark, terminate in radicles beneath the &s;oil, and in leaves in
the air, like the broad caudexes with the radicles and a&s;cending
&s;tems, or foilage, of herbaceous plants, they exactly re&s;emble
each other.</P>
<P>We &s;hall therefore divide roots for the purpo&s;e of treating of
their production into bulbous or tuberous roots, into palmated
or branching roots, and into barks; ob&s;erving that though
roots and buds might po&s;&s;ibly have exi&s;ted before &s;eeds, and
though a great number of the roots u&s;ed for nutriment, or for
the purpo&s;es of medicine, or for the arts of dying and tanning,
are immediately produced by buds, or bulbs; yet are they all,
which we now po&s;&s;e&s;s, originally derived, I &s;uppo&s;e, from &s;eeds;
becau&s;e tho&s;e varieties, which have been propagated from buds
or bulbs for many centuries, are believed to acquire hereditary
di&s;ea&s;es, and gradually to peri&s;h.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="430" REF="435">
<HEAD>I. Of tuberous and bulbous roots.</HEAD>
<P>1. Some tuberous roots, as the turnip, bra&s;&s;ica rapa, are im|mediately
produced from &s;eeds, but differ from the other plants,
which are called annual or biennial, in this circum&s;tance; that,
as they are generally &s;owed &s;o late in the &s;ea&s;on as not to have
time to produce flowers and &s;eeds in the &s;ame year, they pro|duce
a knobby root, which con&s;i&s;ts of a re&s;ervoir of nutritious
matter for the future flower-&s;tem, which is to ri&s;e and flouri&s;h
in the &s;ucceeding &s;pring and &s;ummer; whereas the common an|nual
gra&s;&s;es, as oats and barley, do not previou&s;ly lay up a
magazine of nutriment in their roots, but in their joints, which
are &s;weet; and therefore their roots are not u&s;ed for culinary
purpo&s;es, or for provender.</P>
<P>Other tuberous roots are rai&s;ed in the &s;ame manner from
&s;eeds, but are generally &s;own al&s;o &s;o late in the &s;ea&s;on as not to
form their flower-&s;tems in the &s;ame year; as the carrot, daucus
carota; the par&s;nip, pa&s;tinaca &s;ativa; and the beet, beta vulga|ris;
the&s;e al&s;o lay up a &s;tore of mucilaginous and &s;accharine mat|ter
in their roots for the growth of the future flowers. In the
beet-root the cry&s;tals of &s;ugar are &s;ometimes vi&s;ible by a micro&s;|cope;
and I was well informed, that a labourer in Lincoln|&s;hire
made &s;mall beer from a decoction of par&s;nip roots, which
was &s;pirituous enough, and not of di&s;agreeable flavour; and Mr.
Hornby of York, by boiling carrots, and fermenting the juice
expre&s;&s;ed from them, produced two hundred gallons of proof
&s;pirits from twenty tons of carrots. Edinb. Tran&s;act. Vol. II.
p. 28. Now as all vinous &s;pirit has been &s;ugar, there is foun|dation
to hope that a method may be di&s;covered of producing
and &s;eparating &s;ugar from the&s;e plants of our own climate in
&s;ufficient quantity for our dome&s;tic con&s;umption, or even for
exportation.</P>
<P>Other tuberous roots are propagated from &s;eeds in the &s;ame
manner; and though they are &s;owed early, and produce their
flower-&s;tem and &s;eeds in the &s;ame year, yet they form a knobby
root, which con&s;i&s;ts of a magazine of nutritious matter, previous
to the elevation of the flower-&s;tem, as the radi&s;h, rhaphanus &s;a|tivus,
<PB N="431" REF="436">
and carrot, and beet, when &s;own early. I neverthele&s;s
&s;u&s;pect that the&s;e, as well as the preceding, con&s;i&s;t in reality
of two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive plants; that which forms the knobby root,
and that which is formed from it, as &s;poken of in Sect. IX.
3. 6.</P>
<P>For the production of roots of the&s;e kinds, which are im|mediately
or &s;econdarily propagated from &s;eeds, our attention
mu&s;t be applied to collect the forwarde&s;t &s;eeds, and
from the be&s;t plants of the kind; and to &s;ow them at the proper &s;ea&s;on
of the early &s;pring, or early autumn; and in a &s;oil which con|tains
&s;ufficient vegetable nouri&s;hment, ob&s;erving, neverthele&s;s,
that as carrots, par&s;nips, beets, and radi&s;hes con&s;i&s;t of knobs
formed in the ground, a le&s;s adhe&s;ive &s;oil is to be &s;elected; as
one abounding with &s;iliceous or calcareous &s;and, as well as with
carbonic earth. But as the turnips are formed chiefly above
ground, this attention to the cohe&s;ion of the &s;oil becomes le&s;s
nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o that it is &s;ufficiently penetrable by the fibres of
their radicles.</P>
<P>There is another art of producing larger roots from &s;eed, and
at an earlier &s;ea&s;on, as of radi&s;hes; which is by &s;owing them
in hot-beds in the early &s;pring, and expo&s;ing the tops to the cold
air during the day, as this prevents the luxuriant growth of the
&s;ummit, and increa&s;es that of the root.</P>
<P>2. Other tuberous roots are generally propagated by &s;ubter|raneous
wires, or roots-buds, from the tuberous roots of their
parents through a long generation, and not either primarily or
&s;econdarily from &s;eeds; as the potatoe, &s;olanum tubero&s;um; and
the ground artichoke, or tuberous &s;un-flower, helianthus tube|ro&s;us;
and perhaps the pig-nut, bunium bulboca&s;tanum.</P>
<P>As the tuberous roots of the potatoe planted in the &s;pring
not only produces many other &s;imilar tuberous roots, but flowers
al&s;o during the &s;ummer; I was led to &s;u&s;pect, that pinching off
the flowers, as they appeared, would contribute to increa&s;e the
number or enlarge the &s;ize of the new roots; which experiment
has been made on a &s;mall &s;cale by one, who believed it to &s;uc|ceed
in a degree deci&s;ive of its utility. See Sect. XIX. 3. 1.
and Sect. VII. I. 3. where it is &s;aid, that pinching off the
flower-&s;tems of bulbous-rooted flowers, when they fir&s;t appear
<PB N="432" REF="437">
on young bulbs only a few years from the &s;eed, is believed to
render the flower duplicate.</P>
<P>As the roots of potatoes are formed beneath the earth, the
&s;oil, in which they are planted, &s;hould be laid hollow and full
of cells, or &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s cohe&s;ion than u&s;ual, to facilitate
the protru&s;ion of their wires, and the enlargement of their roots.
This &s;hould be done by burying &s;ome long litter of &s;traw and
&s;table dung under the &s;oil, for as potatoes are believed to re|quire
more carbonaceous earth than carrots, a mixture of &s;and
is le&s;s advantageous to them.</P>
<P>I was this day &s;hewn by my friend Major Trowel of Derby
a new variety of the potatoe in his excellent new-made garden,
the &s;oil of which con&s;i&s;ts of marl mixed with lime and &s;table
manure. From one root there appeared to i&s;&s;ue &s;ix or eight
&s;tems three or four feet long, at every joint of which were pro|duced
new potatoes; at the lower joints there were three of
the&s;e aerial potatoes, one large one the &s;ize of a pullet's egg,
and a &s;maller one on each &s;ide of it. At the upper joints only
one new aerial potatoe adhered, and the&s;e became &s;maller the
further they were removed from the root; and finally, at the
&s;ummit there had been a flower as there was now a &s;eed-ve&s;&s;el,
called a potatoe-apple. All the&s;e new potatoes at the joints of
the &s;tems were green, becau&s;e they had not been etiolated by
being &s;ecluded from the light, but the terre&s;trial roots were
white. The larger new tuberous roots had eyes on them like
a common potatoe, but the &s;maller ones had begun to &s;hoot out
a new &s;tem or leaves, from their upper part. This variety,
which may be termed an aerial potatoe, is analogous to the ma|gical
onion, and other &s;pecies of allium, which bear cloves, or
roots on their &s;ummits in&s;tead of &s;eeds, and like the viviparous polygonum; but differs in this circum&s;tance, that in all tho&s;e,
I believe, the flowers are barren in re&s;pect to bearing &s;eeds, as
tho&s;e are on the &s;ummit of the &s;pike of polygonum viviparum;
but in the aerial potatoe there was al&s;o a &s;eed-bearing flower at
the &s;ummit of the &s;tem, and the new roots only at the lateral
joints. I &s;hould hope this proliferous variety by cultivation may
become permanent, and give ri&s;e to a new &s;pecies, which may
<PB N="433" REF="438">
produce both aerial potatoes and &s;ubterraneous ones, a twofold
viviparous progeny.</P>
<P>The curling of the leaves of potatoes, which is attended with
&s;o great a diminution of the quantity and &s;ize of the new roots,
is &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to their continued propagation by &s;ub|terraneous,
buds or root-wires, in&s;tead of by &s;eed; that hence
they acquire hereditary di&s;ea&s;es, like the canker or gangrene
of apple trees, which have for one or two centuries been propa|gated
by grafting the &s;cions, as mentioned in Sect. IX. 3. 4.
and XV. 1. 4. Hence by &s;owing the &s;eeds of potatoes, and
cultivating the roots thus produced, new varieties may probably
be &s;oon acquired, exempt from the di&s;ea&s;e of the curled leaf,
and which may be as good in other re&s;pects as tho&s;e which have
been too long propagated by their roots. Some have neverthe|le&s;s
affirmed, that they have &s;een curled potatoe-plants in the
&s;econd year from the &s;eed; and others, that they have &s;een
numerous in&s;ects on the&s;e curled leaves; and others, that the
potatoe-root, the leaves of which are curled, remains hard, and
le&s;s di&s;&s;oluble in the &s;oil, which I have my&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed. More
ob&s;ervations are wanted to elucidate this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e of the degeneracy of potatoes has ari&s;en, I
believe, from planting the lea&s;t in&s;tead of the large&s;t roots, &s;ee
Sect. XVI. 5. and which con&s;equently po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s vigorous
vegetation, as buds and bulbs &s;o exactly re&s;emble the parent plant.
Thus the &s;mall bulbs, which ari&s;e from tulip-roots, will pro|duce
a rather larger bulb annually for three or four years, as I
am informed; but it is the large new central bulb only, which
will produce a flower the next &s;ummer, and another large cen|tral
bulb like it&s;elf. See Sect. IX. 3. 1. Another cau&s;e of the
degeneracy of potatoes may ari&s;e from dividing the larger roots
into too many &s;ets, which mu&s;t deprive the embryon plant of
much of its appropriated nutriment; as the umbilical part of
the root is generally thrown a&s;ide by tho&s;e idly-ingenious di&s;&s;ecters
of it; for though the part, where the umbilical ve&s;&s;els were in|&s;erted,
may not after the mature growth of the bulb appear to
po&s;&s;e&s;s new ve&s;&s;els from the embryon plants, &s;uch as are &s;een on
the lobes of a growing garden-bean; yet, as it becomes decom|po&s;ed,
<PB N="434" REF="439">
it mu&s;t &s;upply mucilaginous or &s;accharine nutriment to
the roots of the new plants.</P>
<P>As the potatoes rai&s;ed from &s;eeds do not flower on the &s;econd
or third year, re&s;embling in this circum&s;tance the bulbs of tulips
and hyacinths; the&s;e new roots, I am told, are &s;old as early
potatoes, and that they are forwarder in their growth from their
being generally planted without being divided; and that they
form their new roots &s;ooner, as they do not flower. To im|prove
the &s;eeds of potatoes &s;ee Sect. XVI. 3. 4.</P>
<P>The following method of planting whole potatoes is recom|mended
in Mr. Adam's E&s;&s;ays on Agriculture, and has a pro|mi&s;ing
appearance.</P>
<P>&startq;The idea,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;which I mentioned before, re&s;pecting
the culture of the Scotch and Anjou cabbages, might be &s;ucce&s;s|fully
applied to that of potatoes. Let us &s;uppo&s;e die ground, in
which they are to be &s;et, is properly prepared by plowing: let
then the furrows be drawn in at four feet di&s;tance all over the
field and cro&s;&s;ed by other furrows at an equal di&s;tance. Where
the&s;e inter&s;ect each other lay in &s;ome dung from a wheelbarrow,
extending from the point of inter&s;ection fourteen or fifteen inches
each way: let a man following &s;pread a little of the mould from
the furrow over the dung; let a third hand put one whole &s;ound
potatoe at the point of inter&s;ection, and one in each furrow, at a
foot di&s;tance from the centre, which will make five in all: a
fourth hand &s;ould now follow with a barrow full of leaves, and
lay them over the plants; should then &s;prinkle &s;ome mould lightly
over them, and leave them &s;o till the plants &s;hoot.</P>
<P>&startq;Thus the plants will occupy a &s;pace of two feet each way,
out of the four feet between the furrows; and the remaining in|tervals
between the plants on each &s;ide will al&s;o be two feet,
which intervals I would hor&s;e-hoe at the proper periods, fir&s;t
one way of the field, and then acro&s;s, laying the mould upon
the plants at each hoeing, &s;o that the &s;paces which the plants
occupied would by the&s;e means become little &s;quare hills filled
with roots; and the intervals between being thus hoed and cro&s;s
hoed, would have the u&s;ual good effects of pulverizing the &s;oil,
de&s;troying the weeds, and preparing the land in the be&s;t manner
po&s;&s;ible for a crop of wheat.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="440">
3. The ground artichoke, helianthus tubero&s;us, &s;eldom ripens
its &s;eeds in this country, and might probably be much improved
by u&s;ing methods to ripen the &s;eed, which are mentioned in
Sect XVI. 3. 4; and by thus producing new varieties; and the
pignut, bunium, bulboca&s;tanum, might probably by cultivation from
the &s;eed &s;upply an agreeable and &s;alutary root to be eaten like
che&s;nuts either raw or roa&s;ted.</P>
<P>4. The &s;eeds of the common onion, allium cepa, generally
produce no flower-&s;tems the fir&s;t year; but each &s;eed produces
concentric leaves, which gradually form a large bulb below them
with one or two, and &s;ometimes three, le&s;s internal bulbs, in|cluded
within three or four general concentric coats, be&s;ides the
three or four coats appropriated to the individual bulbs, as de|&s;cribed
in Sect. IX. 3. 2. On the next year &s;ome &s;pecies of
this genus produce bulbs after their flowers in&s;tead of &s;eeds, as
allium &s;ativum and magicum; others produce not only flowers
but al&s;o bulbs, as allium moly, and &s;pherocephalum. If the
bulbs of the&s;e lea&s;t kinds of allium were planted with de&s;ign to
produce other bulbs, and not to produce &s;eeds, it is probable,
that pinching off the flowers might enlarge the new bulbs, as the
pinching off the flowers of potatoes; and that by &s;uch means
a larger kind of bulbs of &s;ome of this genus might be procured.</P>
<P>5. Another bulbous root, which might be well worthy culti|vation
in moi&s;t ground, is the orchis morio; which is &s;old un|der
the name of &s;alep, after it has been prepared by fir&s;t &s;calding
it in hot water to detract the &s;kin, and afterwards by drying it
in an oven; and which then affords a nouri&s;hing mucilage, which
will long keep uninjured. And, if it was cheaper, might pro|bably
be brought into more exten&s;ive u&s;e as a culinary vegetable,
as mentioned in Sect. XVI. 3. 4. The orchis morio produces
one large new root annually, and probably &s;ome &s;maller offsets,
as otherwi&s;e I do not perceive, how it could increa&s;e in our
meadows, as it does not ripen its &s;eeds in this country.</P>
<P>If the new root be taken away from the old one early in the
year, it is affirmed, that the &s;eeds will ripen in Sweden; which
are otherwi&s;e in that country, as in this, always unprolific; this
experiment might therefore be very advantageous to the cultiva|tor.
Another method of inducing orchis to bear prolific &s;eeds
<PB N="436" REF="441">
may be by con&s;ining the roots in garden pots, which might be
immer&s;ed in a moi&s;t &s;oil, and would probably bear ripe &s;eeds; as
the lily of the valley, convallaria, is &s;aid to do by crowding its
roots &s;o much as to prevent the production of more of them,
Amenet. Academ. Vol. VI. p. 120. A third method of pro|curing
&s;eed from orchis might be by cultivating a few of them in
a hot-hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The root of the &s;now-drop, galanthus, if dug up in winter,
and prepared in the &s;ame manner, might po&s;&s;ibly &s;upply a nutri|tious
mucilage &s;imilar to that of the orchis; as I once boiled a
few of them, and found on ta&s;ting them, that they had no di&s;|agreeable
flavour. If prolific &s;eeds could be procured from this
plant, it might be worth cultivation for the &s;ame purpo&s;es as the
orchis; and the roots of the hyacinth, I am informed, are
equally in&s;ipid, and might be u&s;ed as an article of food; but the
roots of crocus, which I boiled and ta&s;ted had a di&s;agreeable
flavour, and might probably therefore be in&s;alubrious.</P>
<P>Mr. Gmelin in his Hi&s;tory of Siberia a&s;&s;erts, that the roots of
the lilium martagou are u&s;ed as food in that country; and it is pro|bable
that the root of the arum though it be acrid in its raw &s;tate,
might &s;upply palatable and &s;alutary nutriment by cookery; as
Mr. White a&s;&s;erts in his Hi&s;tory of Selborne, p. 43, that it is
&s;cratched up and eaten by thru&s;hes in &s;evere &s;nowy &s;ea&s;ons, and it is
known &s;oon to lo&s;e its acrimony even by expo&s;ing its dry
powder to the air; we may add, that the root of the a&s;phodelus
ramo&s;us is u&s;ed to feed &s;wine in France, and that good &s;tarch is
obtained from the roots of white bryony and of al&s;tromeria
licta.</P>
<P>Other bulbous roots are propagated by flori&s;ts with great at|tention
for the beauty of their flowers, as tulips, hyacinths, lilies,
and many others. For an account of &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ee Sect. IX.

<HEAD>II. Palmated or branching roots.</HEAD>
<P>1. The bulbous and tuberous roots already mentioned were
$$ther &s;uch, as we$e primarily derived from &s;eeds, as the turnip,
<PB N="437" REF="442">
carrot, par&s;nip, radi&s;h, beet, &s;al&s;afi; or &s;uch as were &s;econda|rily
derived from &s;eeds, but immediately from bulbs or knobs &s;i|milar
to them&s;elves, as potatoes, ground artichoke, orchis, pig|nut.
But the branching or palmated roots, which are u&s;ed as
food, or in medicine, or in the arts of dying, are &s;eldom produced
immediately from &s;eeds, but generally from preceding roots, and
are hence the product not of annual but of perennial plants; as
the root of liquorice, glycyrrhiza; of mar&s;h mallow, alcea; of
rhubarb, rheum; and of madder, rubia tinctoria.</P>
<P>The roots of the&s;e perennial plants &s;hoot out not only annual
&s;tems with numerous flower-buds above ground, but al&s;o other
new buds on their caudex, or upper part of the roots beneath
the &s;oil; all which buds protrude their new caudexes not only
over tho&s;e &s;tems, but al&s;o over the old root-branches; and thus
form annually a new bark over the old root, which remains
alive beneath the ground, though the &s;tem peri&s;hes by the winter
fro&s;ts. This happens exactly in the &s;ame manner as the bark of
trees, which annually is produced over the old bark of the root
as well as of the trunk; but in trees the &s;tem-bark as well as the
root-bark &s;urvives the winter.</P>
<P>Hence the&s;e palmated or branching roots of perennial herba|ceous
plants, as of rhubarb, madder, liquorice, continue to in|crea&s;e
in &s;ize by the &s;uper-addition of an annual new bark; but
in four or five years the internal part begins to decay, and the
roots therefore &s;hould be taken out of the ground for u&s;e before
that time. It is &s;aid in the tran&s;actions of the Society for En|couragement
of Arts, Vol. XVI. p. 226, that tho&s;e rhubarb
roots, which were not taken up till they were &s;even or more
years old, were mo&s;t of them good for nothing from the de|cay
of the internal part of the root. The &s;ame is &s;aid to happen
to &s;ome bulbous roots, as the hyacinth; and occurs in all tho&s;e
roots, which are &s;aid to be end-bitten, as a &s;pecies of &s;cabius
called devil's-bit. See Sect. IX. 3. 5.</P>
<P>They &s;hould then be taken up in the winter months, before
the new buds or flower-&s;tems begin to acquire nouri&s;hment from
the root, by which it would be deprived of a part of the nutri|tious,
colouring, or medical matters; which principally re&s;ide in
the bark, or alburnum of it. On this la&s;t account al&s;o the&s;e
<PB N="438" REF="443">
roots &s;hould not be permitted to continue in the ground a much
longer time than that above mentioned, though the internal or
woody part of the root may not decay; as the woody part is
le&s;s adapted to the purpo&s;es expected than the bark and albur|num,
which cover or con&s;titute the numerous branches of the
root.</P>
<P>2. One method to increa&s;e the &s;ize of the&s;e palmated or
branching roots may be by pinching off the flowers, as &s;oon as
they appear, when the &s;eeds are not wanted; this I once &s;aw
practi&s;ed on the rheum palmatum with apparent advantage, as
well as on potatoes, as mentioned above; as more nutriment
may thus be derived to the new buds forming on the roots.</P>
<P>The colouring matter &s;old under the name of annotta, or ar|notta,
which is &s;aid to be obtained from the &s;kin of the kernel
of the bixa of South America, or of the enonymus &s;hrub culti|vated
in our gardens, is believed to be much adulterated with
madder, rubia tinctoria; the root of which for the purpo&s;e of
colouring chee&s;e may be u&s;ed in&s;tead of arnotta, and is to my
knowledge a perfectly harmle&s;s root, though it tinges the bones
of young animals red, who eat it mixed with their food, and
may be grown by chee&s;e-farmers in their own gardens, as it is a
very hardy perennial plant, and requires no art of cultivation. It
may be u&s;ed either by pounding the fre&s;h root and boiling it in
water, or by drying the root for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving it, and
afterwards brui&s;ing and boiling it.</P>
<P>For the cultivation of rubia tinctoria &s;ee Miller's Gardener's
Dictionary, who de&s;cribes with &s;everal plates the manner of
growing and of afterwards preparing this root in prodigious
quantities in Holland; and adds, &startq;that if the cultivation of
madder was carried on properly in England, that it would not
only &s;ave to the nation the great annual &s;um now expended in
the purcha&s;e of it from the Dutch, but would employ a great
number of hands, from the time harve&s;t is over, till the &s;pring
of the year, which is generally a dead time for labourers; and
the pari&s;hes might thence be much ea&s;ed of the poor's rates,
which is a con&s;ideration well worthy public attention.&endq;</P>
<P>The external part of the root of rubia tinctoria is coloured red,
and its internal part yellow, which di&s;tingui&s;hes it from mo&s;t
<PB N="439" REF="444">
other roots, which are generally etiolated owing to their &s;eclu|&s;ion
from the light; which liberates their &s;uperfluous oxygen,
which otherwi&s;e deprives them of colour as in bleaching, by
uniting with their colouring matter, and converting it into a co|lourle&s;s
acid, except where the colouring matter abounds in too
great quantity. This etiolation of mo&s;t roots is evidently owing
to the want of light, becau&s;e many of them, as of white potatoes,
become green if they grow above ground.</P>
<P>3. The roots of &s;ome aquatic plants are u&s;ed in medicine both
of the bulbous and palmated kinds, as &s;cilla maritima, &s;quill or
&s;ea-onion, and the iris luteus, yellow water flag, and the acorus
calamus, aromatic flag. Other aquatic roots are &s;aid to have
&s;upplied food, as the ancient lotus in Egypt, which has been by
&s;ome writers &s;uppo&s;ed to be the nymphaea nelumbo. Herodotus
affirms in his Enterpe, that the Egyptian lotus grows in the
Nile, and re&s;embles a lily; and that the natives dry it in the &s;un,
and take the pulp out of it, which grows like the head of a poppy,
and bake it for bread. The white flowered and the yellow-flowered
nymphaea of our ponds and rivers has a palmated root
&s;ometimes three inches in diameter. In Siberia the roots of the
butomus, flowering ru&s;h, are eaten; both which well de&s;erve
further attention, as they grow &s;pontaneou&s;ly in our ditches and
rivers, which at pre&s;ent produce no e&s;culent vegetables, and
might thence become an article of u&s;eful cultivation. See Sect.
IX. 2. 5.</P>
<P>Some other aquatic roots, as well as terre&s;trial ones, might
probably become e&s;culent and nutritive by boiling or roa&s;ting them
to de&s;troy their acrimony. Or it is probable, that a whole&s;ome
&s;tarch might be obtained from them, as from the roots of white
bryonia, as is affirmed by M. Parmetier, by the &s;imple proce&s;s
of grating the root by a bread-grater of tinned iron into cold
water, and depriving it of its acrid mucilage by frequent cold
ablution. And la&s;tly that they might be &s;o managed as to under|go
fermentation either by previous germination, or by adding
ye&s;t to the juice expre&s;&s;ed from them after boiling and thus be
converted into wine or beer, from which a &s;pirit might be
di&s;tilled, or vinegar produced. See Sect. XI. 2. 5.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="445">
4. The art of pre&s;erving roots, when taken out of the ground,
con&s;i&s;ts either in keeping them alive during the winter without
&s;uffering them to germinate, as life prevents the fermentation or
putrefaction of their juices; or &s;econdly, by depriving them of
their water. For the fir&s;t purpo&s;e the roots, whether bulbous or
palmated, &s;hould be kept in a degree of heat above the freezing
point of 32; &s;ince freezing them de&s;troys their life; whence
they not only undergo a &s;udden change in their flavour and nu|tritive
quality, but quickly tend to putrefaction in con&s;equence of
their lo&s;s of life like the eggs of animals. Neverthele&s;s both ve|getable
and animal products, as fruits and fle&s;h, as well as roots,
may probably long exi&s;t unchanged in a frozen &s;tate in ice-hou&s;es;
and it they are at length gradually thawed by covering them with
melting ice, or immer&s;ing them in cold &s;pring water, it is &s;aid by
Mr. Reaumure, who tried the experiment on apples, that they
do not lo&s;e much of their flavour, if they be afterwards &s;oon
made u&s;e of; otherwi&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, as the fro&s;t has deprived
them of life, they &s;oon begin to undergo chemical changes.</P>
<P>If the&s;e roots are kept in a degree of heat above 48, which is
the heat of the internal parts of the earth, and con&s;equently of
&s;pring water, they are liable to germinate, as happens to onions
and potatoes in our &s;tore-hou&s;es during the vernal months. And
if they be expo&s;ed to a much greater heat, &s;o as to de&s;troy the
life of the root, they &s;oon run into fermentation or putrefaction,
or become covered with mould; unle&s;s the water which they
contain be quickly di&s;&s;ipated by evaporation. A friend of mine
once &s;ent many &s;trikes of potatoes to be dried on a malt-kiln,
hoping by that means to pre&s;erve them during the &s;ummer; but
as the life of the&s;e roots was de&s;troyed by the degree of heat,
and only about half of their water evaporated, they &s;oon became
&s;o putrid after being returned into his &s;tore room, that the &s;tench
of them was intolerable, and even the &s;wine refu&s;ed to eat them.
Neverthele&s;s I believe, if the parts either of vegetables or ani|mals
could be kept in an heat at or above the boiling point of
212 in clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els, &s;o as not to &s;uffer their fluid part to evapo|rate,
that neither fermentation nor putrefaction would en&s;ue; but
that they might be kept for years unchanged, as in the cold of
32.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="446">
The degree of heat required for pre&s;erving roots &s;ecure from
fro&s;t, and from the proce&s;s of germination, which is that be|tween
the degrees of 32 and 48 of Farenheit's thermometer,
may be well managed by &s;toring them beneath the &s;oil in dry
&s;ituations, as in dry cellars, or in pits dug for that purpo&s;e, or
even in barns; but this requires more attention than is u&s;ually
employed in the common manner of &s;toring potatoes, which are
liable to be injured both by fro&s;t and by germination. The&s;e
pits in a dry &s;oil &s;hould be covered with materials, which con|duct
heat ill, and al&s;o with &s;uch as might ab&s;orb any putrid ex|halations,
which may occur, and thus check the progre&s;s of pu|trefaction,
if it &s;hould commence.</P>
<P>Air is a bad conductor of heat, if it be con&s;ined over the &s;ur|face
of any body, but not &s;o if it be perpetually changed; as it
then carries away heat very rapidly, as any one may experience
by being fanned on a hot day. Hence all &s;uch materials as po&s;|&s;e&s;s
large pores or inter&s;tices full of air, are bad conductors of
heat; as blankets, &s;aw-du&s;t, wood-&s;havings or &s;traw; and will
thence pre&s;erve the bodies, they cover, both from external cold
and from external heat. But as charcoal in coar&s;e powder not
only includes much common air in its pores, but al&s;o has the
property, e&s;pecially if recently burnt, of ab&s;orbing putrid exha|lations;
and is al&s;o it&s;elf of an unperi&s;hable nature; it &s;eems pe|culiarly
adapted to the purpo&s;es above mentioned. Hence the
heaps of potatoes, or carrots, or par&s;nips, or ground artichokes,
or even the roots of turnips or of beets, and the heads of cab|bages,
and perhaps pears, and apples, as well as nuts, almonds,
and walnuts, might be well pre&s;erved in pits or cellars, or even
in barns, if they were fir&s;t covered with powdered charcoal an
inch or two in thickne&s;s, and over that a covering of &s;aw-du&s;t,
and finally over the&s;e a thick impenetrable thatch of &s;traw;
whence a &s;tore of provender for the winter months and the &s;uc|ceeding
&s;pring may be pre&s;erved from any degree of cold or of
warmth much above or below that of the internal parts of the
earth, in which &s;eeds are known to continue for ages even with|out
germination, or decay.</P>
<P>It is neverthele&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to dry many palmated roots, when
they are taken out of the ground, either becau&s;e they will not
<PB N="442" REF="447">
continue to live in our barns or &s;tore-rooms, like the bulbous
roots, or becau&s;e they require to be kept for &s;ome years in the
&s;hops of medicine. Some of the&s;e roots, as tho&s;e of rhubarb
are &s;aid like the bulbous roots of &s;cilla or &s;quill to contain five
&s;ixths of their weight of water, and therefore require con&s;idera|ble
care in the method of drying them; for unle&s;s they are
properly dried, they are liable to contract mould or mucor;
which is a vegetable production, which will grow on putrefying
materials without light or much air; but might be prevented
from growing by the vapour of perhaps a tea&s;poonful of &s;pirit of
wine, as mentioned in Sect. XV. 2. 3.</P>
<P>There is neverthele&s;s &s;ome precaution nece&s;&s;ary in exhaling
the moi&s;ture of the&s;e roots, as they &s;hould be placed in a &s;itua|tion,
where they are ventilated as well as heated; for warmth
alone is liable to forward the tendency of the &s;accharine and
mucilaginous parts of them to pa&s;s into fermentation or putre|faction,
and thence to de&s;troy them; as the alburnum or &s;ap-wood
of timber trees is liable to decay by what is termed the
dry rot.</P>
<P>With this de&s;ign drying hou&s;es are con&s;tructed for the pre|paration
of madder, rubia tinctoria, as de&s;cribed in Miller's
Dictionary; and the rhubarb of the &s;hops has frequently large
holes bored through it; which, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, were de&s;igned,
to pa&s;s cords through for the purpo&s;e of &s;u&s;pending it to dry,
as it is conveyed on camels in a warm climate.</P>
<P>5. The cultivation of mu&s;hrooms, morels, and truffles, aga|ricus,
phallus, lycoperdon, &s;hould be here mentioned; as they
are propagated by their roots. The fungi &s;eem to con&s;titute an
i&s;thmus between the two great continents of nature, the vegeta|ble
and animal kingdoms. The odour of a fungus, when burn|ing,
approaches to that of burning feathers; and all of them
putrefy like animal fle&s;h; &s;ome of them as the phallus impu|dicus,
&s;tink-horn, emits &s;uch a putrid &s;cent, as it grows, as to
attract innumerable fle&s;h-flies to depo&s;it their eggs or &s;pawn in it.
And tho&s;e mu&s;hrooms, which are cooked at our tables, as well
as the catchup, made by pre&s;erving their juices in &s;alt and water,
po&s;&s;e&s;s an animal flavour. Of this la&s;t circum&s;tance I was told
a remarkable in&s;tance, where a cook maid in a family of inva|lids,
<PB N="443" REF="448">
who frequently wanted weak broth, perpetually deceived
them by a mixture of a &s;mall quantity of good catchup with
thin gruel, and with only the addition of &s;hred leaves of par&s;ley,
and a little &s;alt.</P>
<P>Another thing in which the fungu&s;es differ from vegetables,
con&s;i&s;ts in their growing perfectly well without light, which is
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the health of vegetables. The &s;carlet folds be|neath
the head of the common e&s;culent mu&s;hroom are &s;o like the
gills of fi&s;h, that they have in our language obtained the &s;ame
name. The&s;e folds beneath the hat of the agarics, the pores
beneath the boletus, and the thorny appearance beneath the
hydnum, and the net-like pores of phallus, are all different
means of expo&s;ing a larger &s;urface to the air; and therefore
undoubtedly con&s;titute the lungs of the fungu&s;es, as leaves con|&s;titute
tho&s;e of vegetable, and not their organs of reproduction,
as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The chemical analogy, which exi&s;ts between &s;ome of the
mu&s;hroom tribe and animal matters, led Van Humboldt to in|ve&s;tigate
their conducting power of what he terms the galvanic
fluid, which I believe to be &s;imply a minute &s;hock of the elec|tric
fluid; and he found, that morels and tho&s;e fungi which in
a &s;tate of putrefaction emit a cadaverous animal &s;mell, are
equally good conductors as real animal &s;ub&s;tances. Annals of
Medicine for 1798, Edinb. Van Humboldt a&s;&s;erts further, that
by chemical analy&s;is they approach likewi&s;e to animal &s;ub|&s;tances,
as they contain much azote and pho&s;phorous. He al&s;o
a&s;&s;erts, that he converted morels into fat by means of &s;ulphuric
acid diluted with water, which experiment he thinks is analo|gous
to that of Gibbes, and of the burying ground of the Inno|cents,
where fat was formed from mu&s;cular fle&s;h. Journal de
Phy&s;ique, Vol. IV. p. 67.</P>
<P>The fungi would hence appear to be animals without loco|motion,
who&s;e lacteal ve&s;&s;els are in&s;erted into the earth, like
tho&s;e of vegetables; but who&s;e gills or lungs are covered from
the light, like tho&s;e of animals, but expo&s;ed to the open air like
the leaves or lungs of vegetables. Another curious occurrence,
which &s;eems to a&s;&s;ociate them with animals, if the truth can be
depended upon, is that &s;ome of them are of animal origin; as
<PB N="444" REF="449">
the common mu&s;hroom is &s;aid certainly to be procured from
hor&s;e-dung, as mentioned below; and may therefore have its
embryon or early &s;tate in the inte&s;tines of animals, and its ma|turer
&s;tate in the &s;oil or atmo&s;phere like other in&s;ects, as the
bot-fly, and perhaps the tape-worm, and a&s;carides? as this pro|duction
of mu&s;hrooms is otherwi&s;e contrary to all known ana|logy.
Other fungi are found on the decayed parts of peculiar
vegetables, from which they &s;eem to take their origin, perhaps
like worms in the inte&s;tines of animals, as the agaric of the oak,
of the beech, of the elder; the boletus of the beech, and of
the willow; and many others mentioned by Linneus.</P>
<P>The lycoperdon tuber, or truffle, grows under ground with|out
light, never ri&s;ing into day; and is propagated, I &s;uppo&s;e,
by only a paternal or lateral progeny, like the polypus of our
ditches, and not by &s;exual connexion, or &s;eminal progeny. The
truffle is hunted by dogs probably from its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;omewhat
of an animal &s;cent, like the per&s;pirable effluvia left upon the
ground, by which they hunt their game or di&s;cover the foot of their ma&s;ter</P>
<P>The phallus e&s;culentus, morel, and the agaricus, mu&s;hroom
of various kinds, will grow without light in cellars, or on beds
covered with &s;traw; and are al&s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, propagated by a
paternal or lateral progeny only, and not by a &s;exual or &s;eminal
one.</P>
<P>The roots, or &s;pawn, or embryons, of the common mu&s;h|room
are &s;aid by Mr. Kenedy and others to be certainly procur|ed
from hor&s;e-dung laid unbroken in &s;mall heaps under cover.
It is a&s;&s;erted, that in a few weeks during the &s;ummer months
the&s;e roots will appear like white threads; which on breaking
the lumps have the mu&s;hroom &s;mell. The&s;e hor&s;e-droppings
are directed to be as little broken as po&s;&s;ible, and to be laid
about three inches thick on a hot-bed of moderate warmth, con|&s;tructed
of alternate layers of tanner's bark and hor&s;e-dung, and
who&s;e uppermo&s;t &s;tratum con&s;i&s;ts of tanner's bark about two
inches thick. The bed is then to be covered with a little ma|nure,
and about three inches of good &s;oil, and finally with a
thick coat of &s;traw. The &s;hed behind mo&s;t hot-hou&s;es is found
to afford a convenient place for a mu&s;hroom bed; as no light
<PB N="445" REF="450">
is required, but only warmth, and occa&s;ional moi&s;ture. See
Kenedy on Gardening, Vol. II. for a particular account of
this proce&s;s.</P>
<P>In the tanyards of Derby, I am well informed, that a pro|duction
of mu&s;hroom &s;pawn always occurs in the path, where
the hor&s;e walks, which draws the rolling &s;tone to grind the
bark, which path con&s;i&s;ts of powdered oak-bark and hor&s;e-dung
trampled together. Of this I was in one in&s;tance an eye-witne&s;s,
but whether the embryons of mu&s;hrooms were derived from the
oak-bark or hor&s;e-dung was not ea&s;y to determine.</P>
<P>Mr. Ferber, in his Travels through Italy, tran&s;lated by
Ra&s;pe, mentions the mu&s;hroom-&s;tone. He &s;ays, &startq;the pietra
fungaia is a white calcareous &s;talactite, or tuph-&s;tone, dug in the
lime&s;tone hills bordering on Romagna, and endowed with the
quality to produce in any &s;ea&s;on of the year e&s;culent mu&s;hrooms,
if kept in a moi&s;t cellar, and now and then &s;prinkled with
water. This quality is owing to a great many roots, or vegeta|ble
&s;ibres, together with the mu&s;hroom &s;eeds enclo&s;ed in its &s;ub|&s;tance.
They are u&s;ed in &s;ome great hou&s;es in Naples and
Rome. I &s;aw an indurated mould from the &s;ame place that
had the &s;ame quality, which was u&s;ed by Mr. Fabriani in the
mint of Florence.&endq;</P>
<P>From this account the mu&s;hroom-&s;tone appears to con&s;i&s;t of a
porous tupha, like that with which the hou&s;es are built at Mat|lock
Bath; and which has been depo&s;ited from the water.
But a later writer has &s;ince analy&s;ed one of the&s;e &s;tones, but
does not mention how long it had been u&s;ed for the vegetation
of mu&s;hrooms, which might in great mea&s;ure affect the re&s;ults of
his analy&s;is. Mr Gadd, in the Stockholm Tran&s;actions, &s;ays,
that this pietra fungaia de&s;cribed fir&s;t by Ferber con&s;i&s;ts of forty-five
or forty-&s;ix hundredth parts of &s;iliceous earth, and twenty
of a calx of iron, with a little magne&s;ia and vegetable alkali.
Analytic. Review, Dec. 1798.</P>
<P>In this country the cellars would not be &s;ufficiently warm to
produce mu&s;hrooms at any &s;ea&s;on of the year; but as this mu&s;h|room-&s;tone
is of calcareous origin according to Ferber, it &s;hews,
that calcareous earth is friendly to the growth of mu&s;hrooms;
and a &s;imilar porous &s;tone from the vicinity of Matlock Bath
<PB N="446" REF="451">
might probably be permeated in a &s;imilar manner with the roots
of them, as a convenient repo&s;itory of them to be rai&s;ed into life
occa&s;ionally by warmth and moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Some of the fungi are believed to po&s;&s;e&s;s an intoxicating qua|lity,
and are eaten for that purpo&s;e by the pea&s;ants in Siberia.
One fungus of the &s;pecies agaricus mu&s;carum eaten raw, or a
decoction of three of them, produces intoxication for twelve or
&s;ixteen hours. Hi&s;t. of Ru&s;&s;ia, Vol. I. Nichols, 1780. The
O&s;tiachs al&s;o bli&s;ter the &s;kin by a fungus found on birch trees, and
u&s;e the official agaric fo$ &s;oap. Other fungi po&s;&s;e&s;s a juice &s;o acrid
in their raw &s;tate as immediately to bli&s;ter the tongue, as I
once experienced on ta&s;ting a minute drop of the juice of
a large mu&s;hroom, which on breaking the hat poured out a yel|low
juice, which became purple or blue in a few &s;econds of
time on its being expo&s;ed to the air; which I believed to be
the fungus delicio&s;us of Linneus; the acrimony of which might
neverthele&s;s probably be de&s;troyed by a boiling heat. And it
is al&s;o probable, that the common e&s;culent mu&s;hroom may &s;ometimes
di&s;agree from their being not &s;ufficiently &s;tewed, or by
the incautious mixture of &s;ome intoxicating fungi along with
them.</P>
<P>Otherwi&s;e tho&s;e in common u&s;e at our tables appear to &s;up|ply
a whole&s;ome and nutritive food, approaching towards an
animal nature. Two or three kinds are &s;aid to be eaten in
France be&s;ides the rid-gilled ones which are eaten here; and
it is probable many other kinds of fungi might be found agree|able
to the palate, and whole&s;ome food, if well boiled, which
might de&s;troy their acrimony; and e&s;pecially tho&s;e which when
broken have &s;imply the agreeable &s;mell of the red-gilled ones
in common u&s;e; and &s;ome of the&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, might be eaten
raw without injury, as many people eat the red gilled ones.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides &s;ome mu&s;hrooms with white gills, which when broken
had the grateful &s;cent of the common red-gilled mu&s;hroom, and
which were &s;aid to be more delicious, I have known the peziza
auricula, or ear-fungus, which was formerly an article of the
materia medica under the name of the Jew's ear, to be &s;tewed
and eaten in con&s;iderable quantity with impunity; and was
e&s;teemed an agreeable article at the &s;upper-table. And as this
<PB N="447" REF="452">
was e&s;teemed a pernicious genus of fungi by Clu&s;ins, it is pro|bable,
that many other fungu&s;es might lo&s;e their acrimony by
the heat of &s;tewing, and become whole&s;ome and agreeable food;
which are at pre&s;ent in di&s;u&s;e from their di&s;agreeable acrimony
in their raw &s;tate, or from the bad character they have acci|dentally
acquired.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be added, that though tho&s;e plants, which are &s;up|po&s;ed
to po&s;&s;e&s;s an alkale&s;cent property, and to be liable to
putrefaction &s;ooner than other vegetables, lo&s;e a part of their
acrimony by a boiling heat, as water-cre&s;&s;es, cabbages, onions;
yet that plants, who&s;e acrimony is of a different kind, as ginger,
cap&s;icum, arum, do not become much milder by boiling. I
this morning directed &s;ome leaves of common &s;potted arum, and
of arum ari&s;&s;arum to be boiled, and on ta&s;ting them found my
tongue and lips almo&s;t excoriated. The nature of this kind of
acrimony has not been &s;ufficiently inve&s;tigated by the chemi&s;ts,
but probably depends on a fixed e&s;&s;ential oil.</P>

<HEAD>III. Barks.</HEAD>
<P>1. The barks of the trunks of trees are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of
their roots, and may be e&s;teemed a part of them, as they con|&s;i&s;t
of an intertexture of the ve&s;&s;els, which de&s;cend from the
plume of each individual bud to the radicle of it, and con&s;titute
its caudex. The bark neverthele&s;s of the root is furni&s;hed with
lymphatics to ab&s;orb water and nutritious juices from the earth,
and is covered with a moi&s;ter cuticle; while the bark of the
&s;tem is furni&s;hed with lymphatics to ab&s;orb moi&s;ture from the
air, and is covered with a drier cuticle; the latter refembling
the external &s;kin of animals, and the lymphatics, which open
upon it; and the former re&s;embling the mucous membrane of
the &s;tomach, and its lacteals.</P>
<P>As the &s;ap-juice ri&s;es in all deciduous trees during the vernal
months to expand their foliage, though probably in greater
quantity in &s;ome trees than in others, it mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t not only of
&s;ugar and mucilage, as in the maple and birch, but of various
other ingredients in different trees, which have not been attend|ed
to; as appears from the ta&s;te of their young leaves, as of oak
<PB N="448" REF="453">
or a&s;h. And as &s;ome of the&s;e materials re&s;ide in the roots and
&s;ap-wood or alburnum, &s;o others of them may perhaps re&s;ide in
the bark, where they have been depo&s;ited during the preceding
&s;ummer, and become lignified by the warmth of the &s;pring, or
di&s;&s;olved by the moi&s;ture ab&s;orbed from the earth and air, and
conveyed upwards to the opening buds; whence it is evident,
that the barks of trees &s;hould be taken off for u&s;e in winter or in
early &s;pring, before their buds begin to expand; as then a part
of the&s;e nutritious juices, or of the other materials, which are
required for medicines, or in the $word$ of dying and tanning, are
in part expended on the young leaves; which generally po&s;&s;e&s;s
the ta&s;te and qualities of the bark, though in a le&s;s degree.</P>
<P>It may neverthele&s;s be ob&s;erved, that all tho&s;e a&s;tringent, or
other materials, may re&s;ide in the alburnum of the trunk or roots
of all perennial vegetables, as well as in their barks; becau&s;e
the young leaves, which pullulate on decorticated oaks, have
the &s;ame bitter flavour as the leaves on tho&s;e, which have not
been decorticated; which may in part be derived from the bark
of the root, which is &s;till in the ground, and be carried up the
ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ap-wood to the new buds.</P>
<P>2. Hence the bark of oak-trees &s;hould be taken off during the
winter; but when the &s;ap-juice re&s;iding or a&s;cending in the ve&s;|&s;els
of the alburnum becomes more liquefied by the warmth of
the &s;pring, or is mixed with more moi&s;ture, and pu&s;hed up with
great force by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the roots, it oozes out in
&s;ome degree between the alburnum and the bark; and thus the
bark becomes &s;o much more readily &s;eparated from the &s;ap-wood;
whence this bu&s;ine&s;s is generally done early in the
&s;pring, and &s;hould be performed as &s;oon as this facility of de|tracting
the bark appears, as mentioned in Sect. III. 5; becau&s;e
this proce&s;s of the germination of the buds continues to injure
the bark, whether the tree be cut down or not; as the buds
expand their foliage on new felled trees, as they lie on the
ground.</P>
<P>3. The interior barks of &s;ome trees, like the alburnum or
roots above de&s;cribed, contain much mucilaginous or nutritious
matter; as the bark of elm, ulmus, and of holly, ilex; and
probably of all tho&s;e trees or &s;hrubs which are armed with thorns
<PB N="449" REF="454">
or prickles which are de&s;igned to prevent the depredations of ani|mals
on them, as the hawthorn, goo&s;eberry, and gor&s;e, cre|taegus,
ribes gro&s;&s;ularia, ulex. The internal barks of the&s;e ve|getables
may be conceived to be their alburnum le&s;s indurated,
and might probably all be u&s;ed as food for our&s;elves or other ani|mals
in years of &s;carcity, or for the purpo&s;e of fermentation; as
I doubt not but the inner bark of elm-trees, ulmus, detracted in
the &s;pring by being boiled in water might be converted by the
addition of ye&s;t into &s;mall beer, as well as the alburnum of the
maple and birch, acer et betula; all which are now &s;uffered to
be eaten by in&s;ects when tho&s;e trees are felled.</P>
<P>For the &s;ugar, which is extracted from the vernal &s;ap-juice
of the maple and birch, as well as that found in the manna|a&s;h,
fraxinus ornus, &s;eems to re&s;ide during the winter months in
the root or alburnum, rather than in the bark properly &s;o called;
and to become liquefied, as above mention, by the warmth of
the &s;pring, or di&s;&s;olved by the moi&s;ture ab&s;orbed from the earth,
and conveyed to the opening buds; but re&s;ides &s;olely in the roots
of perennial herbaceous plants; and in the economy of gra&s;&s;es,
and I &s;uppo&s;e of the &s;ugar-cane, it is depo&s;ited at the bottom of
each joint, which is properly the root of the &s;tem above it, as
&s;hewn in Sect. IX. 3. 1.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e the bark of the holly not only yields a nutritious mu|cilage,
and thus &s;upplies much provender to the deer and cattle
in Needwood-fore&s;t by the branches being cut off, and &s;trewed
upon the ground, in &s;evere &s;ea&s;ons of fro&s;t and &s;now; but con|tains
a re&s;inous material, which is obtained by boiling the bark,
and wa&s;hing away the other parts of it. This re&s;inous material
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great adhe&s;ivene&s;s to feathers and other dry porous bo|dies,
and has hence obtained the name of bird-lime, and much
re&s;embles the caoutchouc or ela&s;tic re&s;in brought from South
America, and al&s;o re&s;embles a fo&s;&s;il ela&s;tic bitumen found near
Matlock in Derby&s;hire, both in its ela&s;ticity and inflammability.
Hollies may be worth cultivating for this material be&s;ides the
u&s;es of their wood, as I was informed, that thirty years ago a
per&s;on, who purcha&s;ed a wood in York&s;hire, &s;old to a Dutch
merchant the bird-lime prepared from the bark of the numerous
hollies for nearly the whole &s;um given for the wood; which if it
<PB N="450" REF="455">
could be hardened might probably be &s;old for the ela&s;tic re&s;in
above mentioned. Whether this re&s;embles the nutritive re&s;inous
material found in wheat flour, when the mucilage and &s;tarch are
wa&s;hed from it, might be worth inquiry, as mentioned in Sect.
VI. 8. 5.</P>
<P>4. Other barks contain bitter, re&s;inous, aromatic, or acrid
materials, which &s;upply the &s;hops of medicine, as peruvian bark,
ca&s;carilla, cinnamon, and were de&s;igned by nature to protect
tho&s;e vegetables from the depredations of quadrupeds or in&s;ects.
Hence many trees, and even the wood of them, after it is dried,
and made into dome&s;tic furniture, is never devoured by worms,
as the mahogany, cedar, cypre&s;s; and hence many plants, as the
foxglove, digitalis, hounds-tongue, cynoglo&s;&s;um, henbane, hyo&s;|ciamus,
and many trees, are not devoured by any animals; as
their juices would be poi&s;onous to them, or much di&s;agree with
their &s;tomachs, if their di&s;gu&s;tful flavours to the no&s;e or palate
did not prevent their eating them. The &s;ame defence of the ve|getable
kingdom from human dige&s;tion, except tho&s;e which have
in long proce&s;s of time been &s;elected and cultivated, appears from
the relation of &s;ome unfortunate &s;hipwrecked travellers, who have
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hundreds of miles along uninhabited countries almo&s;t
without finding an e&s;culent vegetable production.</P>
<P>5. Other barks contain re&s;tringent or colouring particles, em|ployed
in the arts of dying and tanning, as berberry, oak, and a&s;h,
berberries, quercus, fraxinus. The art of tanning con&s;i&s;ts in
filling the pores of the animal mucous membrane with the&s;e re|&s;tringent
particles found in &s;ome vegetables, which are believed
to po&s;&s;e&s;s a quality of &s;hortening animal fibres. Thus when a
long hair is immer&s;ed &s;ome time in a &s;olution of the bark of oak,
or of the galls produced on its leaves by the punctures of in&s;ects,
the hair is &s;aid to be &s;hortened. Whether this proce&s;s be occa|&s;ioned
by chemical coagulation of the mucus, of which the&s;e
fibres totally or in part con&s;i&s;t, or by capillary attraction tending
to di&s;tend the&s;e fibres in breadth, and thus to &s;horten them, as
a twi&s;ted &s;tring is &s;hortened by moi&s;ture, has not yet been well
inve&s;tigated. By thus impregnating the pores of animal &s;kins
with vegetable particles, they become le&s;s liable to putrefaction,
as con&s;i&s;ting of a mixture of animal and vegetable matter, as
<PB N="451" REF="456">
well as much better adapted to many dome&s;tic or mechanical pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>The art of dying con&s;i&s;ts likewi&s;e in impregnating the pores
of dry &s;ub&s;tances with a &s;olution of the colouring matter extracted
from vegetables by the capillary attraction of tho&s;e pores to the
coloured &s;olution. And &s;econdly, by a chemical change of
tho&s;e colouring particles after they have beem imbibed, and the
water of the &s;olution exhaled, by again &s;teeping them in another
&s;olution, which may chemically affect the former. Thus as
green con&s;i&s;ts of a mixture of blue and yellow, it may be be&s;t
produced by boiling the material de&s;igned to be dyed fir&s;t in a
decoction of one of the&s;e colours, as of indigo; and then in that
of another, as of the bark of berberry. And as a &s;olution of
iron becomes black when mixed with a decoction of oak-galls&punc;
by being in part precipitated; it is probable, that the particles of
this combination of a &s;olution of iron with re&s;tringent matter
may be larger than either of tho&s;e particles &s;eparately; and
therefore that, if a dry porous &s;ub&s;tance be immer&s;ed fir&s;t in a
decoction of oak-galls, and after being &s;uffered to dry, is then
immer&s;ed in a &s;olution of iron, the black tinge will penetrate
into minuter pores, and thus become more inten&s;e, than if the
&s;ub&s;tance had been immer&s;ed in the black dye already prepared.</P>
<P>6. Other barks are u&s;ed for apparel, paper, cordage, and for
many mechanical purpo&s;es, owing to the &s;trength and tenacity of
their &s;ibres, or to the finene&s;s of them; as hemp, cannabis;
flax, linum; for the purpo&s;es of &s;pinning and weaving; an art
invented by I&s;is, queen of Egypt, who &s;eems fir&s;t to have culti|vated
flax; which was brought into Europe from the banks of
the Nile. The bark or leaves of the papyrus, a flag of the Nile,
was fir&s;t u&s;ed for paper; and the bark of the mulberry-tree is &s;till
made into cloth at Otaheite and other &s;outhern i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The art of &s;eparating the fibres of the bark of plants, as they
con&s;i&s;t of the caudexes of buds, or the connecting ve&s;&s;els between
the plumules and the radicles of them, is performed by &s;oaking
them &s;ome weeks in &s;tagnant water; till the mucous membranes,
which connect the&s;e fibres, are de&s;troyed by putrefaction; and
afterwards by drying them, and beating off with hammers, what
may &s;till adhere.</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="457">
The&s;e fibrous parts of the barks of trees, as they contain no
&s;accharine matter, like the alburnum, are much le&s;s liable to
decay than the &s;ap-wood, or perhaps than any part of the tim|ber.
Maupertuis, who went to Lapland to mea&s;ure a degree of
the meridian, &s;ays, that among the numerous trees which lay
upon the ground de&s;troyed by age, or blown down by the winds,
many birch trees appeared whole, owing to the undecayed &s;tate
of their bark; but crumbled into powder on being trod upon;
and that the Swedes took the practice from this of covering their
hou&s;es with this unperi&s;hable bark, on which they &s;ometimes
lay &s;oil, and thus po&s;&s;e&s;s aerial gardens. Voyages by Mavor,
Vol. XII.</P>
<P>7. To increa&s;e the quantity of bark it mu&s;t be remembered,
that the leaf-buds, or viviparous offspring of trees, as they form
new buds, acquire new caudexes extending down into the
ground, and thus increa&s;e the bark of the &s;tem in thickne&s;s;
but the $lower buds acquire no new caudexes, but die, as &s;oon as
they have ripened their &s;eed, and con&s;equently do not increa&s;e
the thickne&s;s of the bark. Whence one method of increa&s;ing
the quantity of the bark is to increa&s;e the number or vigour of
the leaf-buds in contradi&s;tinction to the flower-buds, which may
be done by pinching off the flowers as &s;oon as they appear; and
as the bark becomes gradually changed into wood, this may be
one method al&s;o of forwarding the growth of timber trees, as
mentioned in the next Section.</P>
<P>8. The method of pre&s;erving the bark of trees from mo&s;s con|&s;i&s;ts
in rubbing off that para&s;ite vegetable in wet weather by means
of a hardi&s;h bru&s;h; which is &s;aid to be u&s;ed with advantage on
the apple-trees in the cyder countries; and may at the &s;ame time
give motion to the vegetable circulation, or forward the a&s;cent
of their juices ab&s;orbed by the radical or cortical ab&s;orbents. In
dry weather the bru&s;h &s;hould be frequently dipped in water.
Wa&s;hing the barks of wall-trees by a water-engine may al&s;o faci|litate
the protru&s;ion of their buds in dry &s;ea&s;ons; and might po&s;|&s;ibly
prevent the canker, if applied to dwarf or a&s;pallier apple-trees.
Other para&s;ite vegetables mu&s;t be occa&s;ionally de&s;troyed,
where they occur, as the lichens, fungi, mi&s;letoes; with the
ivies and other climbers, as &s;ome kinds of lonicera, clematis, and
fumaria, woodbine, virgin's bower, and fumitory.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="458">
9. When a wound is made in the bark &s;o as to expo&s;e the al|burnum
to the air, the upper lip of the wound is liable to grow
fa&s;ter downwards, than the lower one is to grow upwards, owing
to the former being &s;upplied directly with nutritive juices &s;ecreted
from the vegetable blood, after its ventilation, and con&s;equent
oxygenation in the leaves; whereas the lower lip only receives
tho&s;e juices laterally by ino&s;culation of ve&s;&s;els. Over the&s;e
wounds the cuticle is liable to project, and to &s;upply a convenient
hiding place for in&s;ects, which either eat the new fibres of the
growing bark, and perforate the alburnum; or by their moi&s;ture,
their warmth, and their excrements, contribute to the decay of
the alburnum, and prevent the healing of the wound. The&s;e
dead edges of the projecting bark or cuticle &s;hould be nicely cut
off, but not &s;o as to wound the living bark</P>
<P>Pla&s;ters of lime or of tar with &s;ublimate of mercury, have
been recommended to pre&s;erve the wounded parts from the air,
and from moi&s;ture, and from in&s;ects; but as all the&s;e materials
are injurious to the fibres of the living bark, they &s;hould be u&s;ed
with caution, &s;o as not to touch the edges of the wound, but
only to cover the alburnum; for this purpo&s;e white lead and
boiled oil, mixed into a thick paint, or with the addition of &s;ub|limate
of mercury, or of ar&s;enic, or of &s;pirit of turpentine,
may probably answer the purpo&s;e; and may be of real utility on
the wounds of tho&s;e trees, who&s;e wood contains le&s;s acrimony,
and is therefore more liable to be bored into and eaten by a large
worm or maggot almo&s;t as thick as a goo&s;e quill: which I have
&s;een happen to a pear tree, &s;o as to con&s;ume the whole internal
wood, till the tree was blown down.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the caution nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in not touch|ing
the living edges of the wounded bark with &s;uch materials as
may injure the tree by their ab&s;orption, I remember &s;eeing &s;everal
young elm trees, which died by their boles having been covered,
as I was informed, by quick-lime mixed with cow-dung to pre|vent
their being injured by hor&s;es; and I have &s;een branches of
peach and nectarine trees de&s;troyed by &s;prinkling them, when in
leaf, with a &s;light &s;olution of ar&s;enic, and others with &s;pirit of
turpentine.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="459">
10. A more curious method of cure is &s;aid to have &s;ucceeded,
where the bark of a tree has recently been torn off even to great
extent, and that is by binding the &s;ame piece of bark on again,
or another piece from the &s;ame tree, or from one of a &s;imilar na|ture,
nicely adapting the edges of the bark to be applied to the
edges of that, which &s;urrounds the wound of the tree, which it
is &s;aid will coale&s;ce in the &s;ame manner, as the ve&s;&s;els of the
bark of an ingrafted &s;cion unite with tho&s;e of the bark of the
&s;tock ingrafted on; which is &s;trictly analogous to the union of
inflamed or wounded parts of animal bodies, as in the cure of
the hare-lip, or the in&s;ertion of the living tooth from one
per&s;on into the jaw of another, or the factitious no&s;es of Tali|cotius.</P>
<P>If the bark over the cankered parts of apple-trees could be
thus renewed by paring the edges of the mortified bark to the
quick, and then nicely applying a piece of healthy bark from an
apple-tree of inferior value, and &s;ecuring it with an ela&s;tic ban|dage,
as a &s;hred of flannel, it would be a very valuable di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>Another method, where a branch of a valuable tree is in the
progre&s;s of being de&s;troyed by canker, might be by inclo&s;ing the
cankered part, and &s;ome inches above it, in a garden-pot of
earth previou&s;ly divided, and &s;upported by &s;takes, and tied to|gether
round the branch; which might then &s;trike roots in the
earth of the garden-pot, and after &s;ome months might be cut
off, and planted on the ground, and might thus be pre&s;erved, and
produce a new tree; which experiment I have this &s;ummer tried
on two apple-trees and believe it will &s;ucceed.</P>

<HEAD>1. Of Leaves.</HEAD>
<P>1. The buds of plants have already been &s;hewn to be indi|vidual
vegetable beings, and the leaves to con&s;titute the lungs of
each individual bud. And la&s;tly, that the new bud in the bo|&s;om
of each leaf is the offspring from the caudex of that old bud,
of which the leaf con&s;titutes the lungs.</P>
<P>The leaves of gra&s;&s;es are of great con&s;equence, as they nou|ri&s;h
many of our dome&s;tic quadrupeds; the cultivation of gra&s;&s;es
has therefore been much attended to. Many of the&s;e propa|gate
them&s;elves more by their roots than by their &s;eed; e&s;pe|cially
where their &s;tems are perpetually de&s;troyed by the grazing
of cattle, &s;heep, or gee&s;e; and &s;ome of them are &s;aid to be vi|viparous,
as the fe&s;tuca dumetorum, or fe&s;cue gra&s;s; that is,
that they bear bulbs on their &s;tems after flowering in&s;tead of
&s;eeds, which in time drop off, and &s;trike root into the ground,
like the polygonum viviparum, and the allium magicum; which
circum&s;tance is &s;aid to obtain in many alpine gra&s;&s;es, who&s;e &s;eeds
are annually devoured by &s;mall birds.</P>
<P>The &s;tems of the gra&s;&s;es con&s;i&s;t in general of joint above
joint without lateral branches; each joint of which &s;eems to be
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive plant growing on the preceding one, and generated in
the bo&s;om of the leaf, which &s;urrounds it; the &s;tem may there|fore
be e&s;teemed a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of leaf-buds, till at length a flower-bud
is produced on the &s;ummit, as &s;hewn in Sect. IX. 3. 1. In
&s;ome gra&s;&s;es, as the agro&s;tis canina, or triticum repens, dog's-gra&s;s,
twitch-gra&s;s, or couch-gra&s;s, the root con&s;i&s;ts of joints as
well as the &s;tem; which may be con&s;idered as &s;eparate individual
plants, like the bulbs of potatoes, as every joint of the&s;e roots
will grow into a new plant to the great annoyance of the agri|cultor,
<PB N="457" REF="462">
which, when the ground is not hard, may be be&s;t I
believe, drawn out by a deep harrow, or by Mr. Cook's &s;cari|fier;
as a plough turns them over under the &s;oil, as it breaks
them, and thus much increa&s;es their number by in a manner
tran&s;planting them. The teeth of the harrow, or &s;carifier,
&s;hould be inclined forwards towards the hor&s;e for the purpo&s;e of
lifting up the roots, and that it may not too ea&s;ily ri&s;e out of the
&s;oil; and it &s;hould be fixed by wedges or &s;crew-nuts to the wooden
frame for the purpo&s;e of occa&s;ionally lengthening them to adapt
them to different &s;oils, as the roots pierce deeper into le&s;s
tenacious &s;oils than into clayey ones.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that a plant of gra&s;s con&s;i&s;ts not only of a
tuft of leaves &s;urrounding the root, but that the three or four
lower joints of the &s;tem, as of a wheat-&s;traw, are &s;o many &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
leaf-buds, which are generated by the caudex of the leaf,
which &s;urrounds each joint, and precede the flower-bud at the
&s;ummit; and that hence with the de&s;ign of producing much
herbage for cattle, the propagation of new leaves from the root
is principally to be attended to; but with the de&s;ign of producing
hay, or winter fodder, the leaf-buds of the &s;tem are principally
to be attended to.</P>
<P>For the former of the&s;e purpo&s;es the &s;tem of gra&s;s &s;hould be
eaten down as &s;oon as it ri&s;es; whence more gra&s;s leaves will
ari&s;e from the root; as is well known to tho&s;e who eat down
the fir&s;t &s;tem of wheat when it is too luxuriant. For the &s;e|cond
purpo&s;e the leaf-buds, which con&s;titute the &s;tems of gra&s;s,
&s;hould be cut down, before the flower-&s;tem at the &s;ummit has
begun to ripen its &s;eeds; as at that time the &s;weet juice lodged
in the joint below the flower-&s;tem becomes expended on the
&s;eed; and the &s;tem becomes converted into &s;traw rather than into
hay.</P>
<P>From hence it is readily under&s;tood, why tho&s;e pa&s;tures, which
are perpetually grazed, are &s;o much thicker or clo&s;er crowded
with gra&s;s roots than tho&s;e, which are annually mowed; and
why gra&s;s cut young makes &s;o much &s;weeter and more nutritive
hay than that, which has ripened and &s;hed its &s;eed. And la&s;tly,
why the hay from gra&s;s cut young is &s;o much more liable to take
<PB N="458" REF="463">
fire, if ricked too moi&s;t; because the greater quantity of &s;ugar
in the joints of the &s;tems produces &s;o violent a fermentation,
when it has &s;ufficient water to di&s;&s;olve it, that it generates &s;o
much heat as to bur&s;t into flame. This might be&s;t be prevented,
where chopped &s;traw is de&s;igned to be given to hor&s;es along
with their hay, by laying alternately in the hay-&s;tack a &s;tratum
of new hay and a &s;tratum of &s;traw, or of clover and &s;traw;
whence the rapid fermentation which occa&s;ions combu&s;tion, may
be prevented, and the &s;traw may be rendered ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion
by being impregnated with the fermentative infection, or ye&s;t,
of the fermenting hay.</P>
<P>The art of increa&s;ing the quantity of leaves round the roots of
gra&s;&s;es con&s;i&s;ts in eating off the central &s;tems by &s;heep, or hor&s;es,
or cattle, early in the &s;ea&s;on, as above mentioned; whence
new ones are produced around the fir&s;t joint of the &s;tem thus
bitten off, and from the di&s;tant horizontal root-wires of &s;uch
gra&s;&s;es, as produce them. In low meadows it is hence doubly
profitable to eat down the early gra&s;s till about the middle of
May, as in moi&s;t &s;ituations there is no danger but a crop of hay
will &s;ucceed; which by this method will be finer and more
copious; and at the &s;ame time &s;ome weeks provender of hay
will have been &s;aved by the u&s;e of the early gra&s;s.</P>
<P>On land intended for pa&s;ture, as for &s;heep, many people ad|vi&s;e
to &s;ow three kinds of vegetables, which may in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
&s;ucceed each other in their growth. Mr. Parkin&s;on &s;ows
four bu&s;hels of the &s;eed of rye-gra&s;s, lolium perenne, ten pounds
of trefoil &s;eed, trifolium praten&s;e, and ten of white clover, tri|folium
repens, on every acre; and adds, that the rye-gra&s;s
&s;hould be eaten early, while the white clover is &s;till concealed in
the ground, and the trefoil makes only &s;ome &s;mall appearance.
That when the rye-gra&s;s is eaten down the trefoil springs up,
and becomes food for the &s;heep; after which the white clover
&s;ucceeds; and alter this is con&s;umed, the rye-gra&s;s again &s;prings
up, and &s;upplies food during the winter months, if the weather
proves tolerably mild; and he further a&s;&s;erts, that a third more
of &s;heep at lea&s;t may be thus nouri&s;hed than by any other means.

For the production of a meadow much &s;uperior to tho&s;e com|monly
&s;een, Mr. Curtis recommends &s;ix kinds of gra&s;s and two
of clover to be &s;owed; the &s;eeds are to be mixed together in
the following proportions. Meadow foxtail, alopecurus praten|&s;is,
one pint; meadow fe&s;cue, fe&s;tuca praten&s;is, one pint;
&s;mooth &s;talked meadow-gra&s;s, poa praten&s;is, half a pint; rough
&s;talked meadow-gra&s;s, poa trivialis, half a pint; cre&s;ted dog's-tail,
cyno&s;urus cri&s;tatus, a quarter of a pint; &s;weet-&s;cented
vernal gra&s;s, anthoxanthum odoratum, a quarter of a pint;
Dutch clover, trifolium repens, half a pint; red clover,
trifolium praten&s;e, half a pint; the&s;e &s;eeds are to be mixed
together, and about three bu&s;hels to be &s;own on an acre in rows
for the convenience of hoeing them. About the end of Augu&s;t
or beginning of September they &s;hould be occa&s;ionally weeded
and thinned, and rolled in the &s;pring, to pre&s;s down into the
ground &s;uch roots as may have been rai&s;ed by the fro&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Curtis thinks that meadow foxtail and rough &s;talked
meadow-gra&s;s &s;uit moi&s;t &s;oils the be&s;t; and that the &s;mooth
&s;talked meadow-gra&s;s and cre&s;ted dog's-tail &s;uit dry pa&s;tures;
and la&s;tly, that the meadow fe&s;cue, and the &s;weet-&s;cented ver|nal
gra&s;s, &s;uit land either moi&s;t or moderately dry; and gives
the following order of their times of flowering. 1. Sweet-&s;cented
vernal. 2. Meadow foxtail. 3. Smooth &s;talked mea|dow-gra&s;s.
4. Rough stalked meadow-gra&s;s. 5. Meadow
fe&s;cue. 6. Cre&s;ted dog's-tail. See Hall's Encycloped. Art.
Agriculture.</P>
<P>Not only new &s;own gra&s;&s;es de&s;igned for meadows, but the
larger gra&s;&s;es, which have the names of corn, as wheat, oats,
barley, may be advantageou&s;ly rolled, when dry, after fro&s;t,
which by expanding the water in moi&s;t &s;oils le&s;&s;ens the cavities,
which are occupied by roots; and as roots or their branches
are in general conical, they become pu&s;hed upwards; and &s;uch as
are loo&s;e ri&s;e quite out of the ground, as is often &s;een to
happen to the roots of the &s;trawberries, when a fro&s;ty night has occurred
&s;oon after their being tran&s;planted. After a &s;light fro&s;t the
larger pebbles of a gravel walk are &s;een below the &s;urface, as if
they had &s;unk downwards during the night; whereas this is
owing to a &s;imilar cau&s;e, the expan&s;ion of the moi&s;t &s;oil or gravel
an inch deep; but as the fro&s;t had not penetrated &s;o low as to
<PB N="460" REF="465">
&s;well the ground beneath the large pebbles, the&s;e had not been
lifted up like the &s;maller ones, on the wet &s;and.</P>
<P>Secondly, both to increa&s;e the quantity of leaves round the
root, and to increa&s;e the &s;ize or vigour, as well perhaps as the
number, of leaf-buds on the &s;tem, a greater &s;upply of water
than u&s;ual, where it can be done, would be advantageous; as
is done to the rice-grounds in warm countries in the early part
of its growth, and as in flooding our own meadows occa&s;ionally
in the vernal months. Thus very moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons are well known
to forward the luxuriant growth of the herbage, and &s;tems, in
the cultivation of wheat, and to render the ears later, and le&s;s
prolific.</P>
<P>Where plants are &s;own for the purpo&s;e of con&s;uming the fir&s;t
foliage, as gra&s;&s;es or &s;aint-foin, the &s;eed &s;hould be &s;own thicker,
than where the plant is grown for the purpo&s;e of producing
&s;eeds, as in wheat or peas: becau&s;e the quantity of the fir&s;t
foliage will be greater in re&s;pect to number; and the central
parts of the tu&s;&s;ocks, as is often &s;een in wheat and peas, when
&s;own too thick, will ri&s;e two or three inches higher in their
conte&s;t for light and air, like the trees of thick planted woods;
and will hence produce a forwarder pa&s;ture as well as a more
copious one.</P>
<P>To which &s;hould be added, that the plants with &s;ucculent
&s;tems, as &s;aint-foin, lucern, red clover, receive &s;o much injury
from the trampling of heavy cattle, that they &s;hould be mowed,
and given to cows and hor&s;es in their &s;talls; which &s;hould never thele&s;s
hare a yard or fold occa&s;ionally to run into with the
convenience of water; and if &s;traw be chopped along with this
green food, it might be a cheap and a &s;alutary addition.</P>
<P>Where a piece of gra&s;s land is overrun with tu&s;&s;ocks of &s;our
gra&s;s, which often happens near towns, I have been informed,
that lime or coal-a&s;hes &s;pread on them would render the gra&s;s
&s;weeter, &s;o that hor&s;es or cattle would eat it. But I &s;uppo&s;e
the more certain and advantageous management would con&s;i&s;t
in mowing it frequently, and giving it to the hor&s;es or cattle in
the &s;table or &s;tall; as I believe they will eat it greedily after it
has been a few hours withered, and thus the land will not only
yield more provender at pre&s;ent, but after a few mowings a
<PB N="461" REF="466">
&s;weeter gra&s;s will ri&s;e in the place of that which was of a bad
kind, or of too luxuriant growth; for which purpo&s;e it &s;hould
be mowed as near the ground as may be; or if it be frequently
mowed during the &s;ummer, and left on the ground, &s;ome cattle
will eat it, when it is withered to a certain degree; by which
the di&s;agreeable flavour of it is probably le&s;&s;ened or de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The art of making hay con&s;i&s;ts in evaporating about two
thirds of the weight of it, as ob&s;erved by Young and Ruckert.
Dr. Hales found a &s;un-flower plant, which weighed forty-eight
ounces to lo&s;e thirty-&s;ix ounces by drying in the air during thirty
days; and con&s;equently to have lo&s;t three fourths of its weight.
Vegetables to appearance perfectly dry contain three fifths or
three fourths of their weight of water; a part of which water
Mr. Kirwan thinks is not in its liquid &s;tate, but that it is by a
lo&s;s of much of its &s;pecific heat in a great mea&s;ure &s;olidified.
Kirwan on Manures, p. 37. Thus when water is thrown on
fre&s;h quick-lime, a part of it unites with the lime, and becomes
&s;olid, giving out much heat; which converts another part of it
into &s;team, as mentioned in Sect. X. 4. 4.</P>
<P>There are two methods of making hay practi&s;ed in different
parts of the country. In the more &s;outhern counties the &s;warths
are not turned over or &s;cattered for a day, or two, or three,
but remain as they were left by the &s;cythe. In the more nor|thern
counties the hay-makers follow the mowers, and &s;catter
the gra&s;s immediately, or on the &s;ucceeding day. Perhaps a
method between the&s;e may in general better &s;uit this climate.</P>
<P>Herbs collected for medicinal purpo&s;es, as well as flowers,
&s;hould be dried in the &s;hade; otherwi&s;e they become bleached,
and lo&s;e both their colour and their odour, by too great in&s;ola|tion,
and exhalation. Now if the &s;warth of cut gra&s;s be only
turned over once a day for three or four days, the internal parts
of it may be &s;aid to be dried in the &s;hade; and afterwards if it
be &s;pread over the ground for only a few hours on a fine day, I
&s;uppose it would become dry enough to &s;tack, and have lo&s;t con|&s;iderably
le&s;s of its nutritive quality. Some advi&s;e a chimney to
be left in the center of a &s;tack to prevent the hay taking fire,
but there &s;hould then al&s;o be culverts under the &s;tack to &s;upply
that chimney with air; which may be made by cutting three or
<PB N="462" REF="467">
four trenches in the earth, and covering them with boards or
&s;ticks with their apertures expo&s;ed to the wind in all directions.
Perhaps the be&s;t way would be to make the &s;tack narrow and long,
and bent into a &s;emicircle or cre&s;cent to enable them the better
to re&s;i&s;t the winds, in&s;tead of round or &s;quare, though a greater
&s;urface would indeed be afterwards expo&s;ed to the weather, and
in &s;ome degree injured, by this mode of con&s;truction.</P>
<P>When the gra&s;s is &s;pread uniformly over the whole meadow,
which is called <HI>tedding,</HI> it will &s;ooner dry, as &s;o much larger a
&s;urface of it is expo&s;ed to the wind and &s;un; but it &s;hould cer|tainly
be put into &s;mall cocks or wind-rows at night, e&s;pecially
if the weather be moi&s;t; becau&s;e it will otherwi&s;e receive much
dirt and &s;lime from the innumerable worms, which ri&s;e out of
the ground always in moi&s;t warm nights, and generally when
the &s;urface is covered with moi&s;t gra&s;s at all &s;ea&s;ons; and when
they retreat into their &s;ubterranean man&s;ions in the morning,
they are liable to draw in the ends of the gra&s;s to &s;top up the
apertures of their holes, and by that means prevent the centipes
from fallowing them into their homes, and de&s;troying them.
See Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XVI. 16. Whence much of the
new hay becomes injured by the &s;oil, they previou&s;ly pu&s;h before
them out of their mines and by that which adheres to the gra&s;s,
which was drawn in to &s;top the apertures of them, as well as by
the &s;lime, which they leave behind them on the new hay, which they pa&s;s through or over.</P>
<P>On this account hay-cocks &s;hould be made as high as may
be in proportion to their ba&s;e, that le&s;s &s;urface may be in con|tact
with the ground, as well as that a greater &s;urface may be
expo&s;ed to the air for a quicker exhalation of its moi&s;ture,
and for the purpo&s;e of the better &s;ecuring it from accidental
&s;howers.</P>
<P>In wet &s;ea&s;ons, I &s;u&s;pect, the be&s;t method mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in
turning over the rows of &s;warth every day or every alternate
day, or making it into &s;mall cocks, and turning them over in
the &s;ame manner, that the rain may not injure the whole of it
by pa&s;&s;ing perpetually through it, and wa&s;hing away its &s;accha|rine
and mucilaginous fluids; and al&s;o that the part next the
ground, and the central parts of the cock or &s;warth, may not
<PB N="463" REF="468">
pa&s;s into fermentation and putrefaction. And la&s;tly, when it
can be put into tall cocks, as the weather becomes drier, it will
not only &s;ooner exhale its moi&s;ture by the contact of the atmo&s;|phere,
but a beginning fermentation will &s;et at liberty &s;ome de|gree
of heat, and thus contribute to dry it by increa&s;ing the
evaporation; as the great heat generated in hay-&s;tacks which
have been fini&s;hed but one day or two, a&s;&s;i&s;ts much to dry the
whole &s;tack in moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, as is &s;een by the den&s;e &s;team,
which ari&s;es from them.</P>
<P>2. Many root-leaves are con&s;umed at our tables either in
their raw &s;tate, as tho&s;e of water-cre&s;s, &s;i&s;ymbrium na&s;turtium,
lettuce, lactuca fativa, mu&s;tard, &s;inapis, celery, apium; many
others are previou&s;ly boiled to dimini&s;h their acrimony, and to
coagulate their mucilage, as the root-leaves of &s;pinach, &s;pinacia,
of cabbage, bra&s;&s;ica oleracea, and even of turnips, bra&s;&s;ica rapa;
along with the&s;e &s;tem-leaves of many plants the flower-buds at
their &s;ummits are eaten, as tho&s;e of mercury, mercurialis, and
of &s;ome of the cabbage kind called brocoli, bra&s;&s;ica italica.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e leaves not only con&s;i&s;t of a re&s;piratory organ,
but at the lower parts of them e&s;pecially, or in their &s;talks, there
exists a re&s;ervoir of nutriment for the ri&s;ing flower-&s;tem or for
the ripening &s;eed, as in rhubarb leaves, and in cabbage leaves,
which is &s;imilar to that in the roots of other herbaceous plants,
and which renders them both palatable and nutritive. Mo&s;t
of the&s;e concentric leaves are &s;ituated in contact with the earth,
as tho&s;e of lettuces, lactuca, and &s;al&s;afi, tragopogon. But others
of them, as the cabbages, are placed on a &s;tem at &s;ome di&s;tance
from the ground; in the former the upper part of the root or
caudex is palatable and nutritious, as well as the lower part of
the leaves; and &s;ome of them are of &s;uperior flavour when boil|ed.
In the latter the re&s;ervoir of nutriment for the future
flower-&s;tem and &s;eed con&s;i&s;ts in the lower part of the ribs of
the concentric foliage, as in the concentric leaves or lamina,
which cover the bulb of the onion, or even in the &s;talks, as in
cabbages, and artichoke, which are therefore not only e&s;culent,
but palatable and nutritive.</P>
<P>Other leaves are eaten in their early &s;tate along with the
&s;tem, which they &s;urround, as a&s;paragus, and the young &s;hoots
<PB N="464" REF="469">
of &s;pinach, and of &s;ome kinds of brocoli, and of mercury;
which la&s;t are &s;ometimes &s;uffered to &s;hew their flowers before
they come to our tables, and are then treated of in Sect. XIX.</P>
<P>The art of cultivating all the&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in &s;upplying them
with abundant carbonic earth, and with abundant moi&s;ture, as
the&s;e are more friendly to the luxuriant growth of root-leaves
or &s;tem-leaves, than to the production of the flowers, or ripen|ing
of the &s;eeds, as appears by the too luxuriant growth both
of herbaceous plants and of fruit-trees in moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Another method of forwarding the growth of the new leaves
and &s;tem-&s;hoots of perennial herbaceous plants, as of a&s;paragus,
is annually to loo&s;en or turn over the earth around and above the
roots, for the purpo&s;e of admitting air into its cells or cavities to
convert a part of the manure or carbonaceous &s;oil, with which
they have been &s;upplied, into ammonia, or into carbonic acid,
and thus both to afford them warmth and nutriment.</P>
<P>Add to this, that the leaves of trees may be increa&s;ed in &s;ize
by lopping off the branches, by which means the remaining buds
acquire more nutriment; the black mulberry tree is thus kept
low, and formed into exten&s;ive &s;hrubberies in China for the pur|po&s;e
of feeding &s;ilkworms, as ob&s;erved by &s;ir G. Staunton, who
thinks the leaves are thus rendered both larger and more &s;uccu|lent;
and adds, that the a&s;h-tree is al&s;o &s;ometimes u&s;ed for the
&s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>3. Another method of de&s;troying the too great acrimony of
leaves, be&s;ides that of boiling them, con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ecluding them
from light, and is termed etiolation. This is chiefly practi&s;ed
on cellery, apium, by earthing it up nearly to the top of the
plant; and on &s;ea-kale, crambe maritima, by covering the
plant entirely with hor&s;e-litter or &s;traw, as de&s;cribed in Sect.
XIV. 3. 3; and on lettuces, and endive, by tying together the
root-leaves with a bandage.</P>
<P>In many plants the central bud during its early growth &s;eems
to be naturally in a &s;tate of etiolation, as it is excluded from
the light by the curvature of the &s;urrounding foliage, as in cab|bages,
and particularly in &s;ome &s;pecies of aloe, which are &s;aid
to con&s;ume nearly a century in opening their numerous concentric
foliage. The&s;e etiolated leaves, like flowers before the calyx,
<PB N="465" REF="470">
is opened, are white; and the leaves become green, or the
flowers of many other colours, when expo&s;ed to the light, as
explained in Sect. XIII. 1. 3. It is probable that the foliage
of many other plants might be rendered e&s;culent by thus de&s;troy|ing
their acrimony, and decrea&s;ing the tenacity of their fibres
by e$iolation, as well as the leaves of celery, apium; and car|doon,
cinara; and of endive, cichorium endivia.</P>
<P>A &s;eclu&s;ion from the &s;un's light and from air has an effect
&s;omewhat &s;imilar on animal bodies, rendering them pale and
weak, as may be &s;een in the etiolated young ladies of &s;ome
boarding &s;chools; and in those who pa&s;s their waking hours in
unventilated parlours during more than half the night.</P>
<P>4. Other vegetable foliage has been brought into very ex|ten&s;ive
u&s;e infu&s;ed in hot water for its agreeable aromatic or
bitteri&s;h flavour, as tho&s;e of foreign tea, thea; and of the a&s;h,
fraxinus, of our own i&s;land, the leaves of which were collect|ed,
before they became expanded, and &s;old after being dried
for the inferior kind of Bohea tea in &s;o great quantity as to oc|ca&s;ion
an act of parliament to be pa&s;&s;ed about forty years ago to
lay a &s;ine on any one, who &s;hould have accumulated more than
fifty pounds of a&s;h leaves, which were not the produce of
his own trees. The leaves of many other of our dome&s;tic ve|getables,
as of mint, balm, and &s;age, mentha, meli&s;&s;a, &s;alvia,
have been infu&s;ed in hot water as an agreeable diluent beverage
both in health and sickne&s;s; the la&s;t of which, the &s;age, posse&s;&s;es
a very plea&s;ant aromatic flavour; and if the infu&s;ion be poured
from the leaves, before it has acquired too much of the bitter
flavour, it is very grateful to the palate or &s;tomach, and has
been e&s;teemed &s;alubrious from high antiquity to the pre&s;ent
times, whence the line of Horace:</P>
<Q>Cur moriatur homo, eui &s;alvia cre&s;cit in horto?</Q>
<P>All the&s;e infu&s;ions become nutritive, when drank with cream
and &s;ugar, and have certainly contributed to the health of the
inhabitants of this i&s;land by decrea&s;ing the potation of ferment|ed
or &s;pirituous liquors; and to their morality by more frequent|ly
mixing the ladies and gentlemen in the &s;ame &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="471">
The leaves of the&s;e plants, as well as the aromatic or bal&s;a|mic
buds of &s;ome other plants, as of myrica, gale; of tacama|haca,
populus bal&s;amifera; of balm of Gilead, amyris giliaden|&s;is,
and many others, &s;hould be gathered at the time of their
greate&s;t fragrance, as the e&s;&s;ential oils, which con&s;titute their
odorous exhalation, perpetually evaporate, as our &s;en&s;e of &s;mell
informs us; and were apparently for the purpo&s;e of defending
the plants from the depredation of in&s;ects in their &s;tate of in|fancy.</P>
<P>5. Other leaves have been u&s;ed for medicinal purpo&s;es, and
for the arts of dying and tanning, like the barks before men|tioned
as the leaves of carduus benedictus, enicus acarna, as
an emetic; tho&s;e of foxglove, digitalis purpurea, as an ab&s;or|bent
in ana&s;arca; tho&s;e of bog-bean, menyanthes trifoliata, as
a corroborant; which la&s;t might probably &s;upply the place of
hops, humulus lupulus, in the breweries of malt-liquors; and as
it might be plentifully cultivated on boggy grounds, which are
not at pre&s;ent u&s;ed for other purpo&s;es, might be a cheaper bitter
to the con&s;umer, and &s;ave to the public much more fertile &s;oil
for the cultivation of corn or other valuable vegetables.</P>
<P>The leaves of teucrium &s;corodonia, wood-&s;age, are as bitter
as tho&s;e of menyanthes, bog-bean, and have been u&s;ed with
&s;ucce&s;s, as I have witne&s;&s;ed, in the cure of agues; and, as it
grows on dry barren &s;oils, might po&s;&s;ibly be cultivated to &s;upply
the place of peruvian bark in &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, or to &s;upply the u&s;e
of hops in the breweries of malt-liquor.</P>
<P>The leaves of oak-trees, quercus robur, and of a&s;h-trees,
fraxinus excel&s;ior, and of alder, betula alnus, even after they
drop &s;pontaneou&s;ly in the autumn, are &s;aid to &s;erve the purpo&s;e
of tanning animal membranes, like the barks of the &s;ame trees
&s;poken of Sect. XVII. 3. 5; and for the purpo&s;es of dying, the
leaves of indigo, indigofera tinctoria; and of wood, i&s;atis tinc|toria;
and of weld, re&s;eda luteola, have been much cultivated,
and exten&s;ively u&s;ed; and a &s;pecies of polygonum is &s;aid to be
much cultivated in China for the &s;ame purpo&s;es as indigofera
by &s;ir G. Staunton; to which may be added the foliage of li|chen
fructico&s;us, or archil, a whiti&s;h lichen brought from the
rocks of the Canary I&s;lands, which gives a beautiful bloom to
<PB N="467" REF="472">
other colours, but is it&s;elf very fugitive. Linnens a&s;&s;erts in the
Swedi&s;h Tran&s;actions, that this archil mo&s;s is to be found
on the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of England; and it is &s;aid, that the
archil is now prepared by Me&s;&s;rs. Gordens at Leith near
Edinburgh from a &s;pecies found in the Highlands of Scotland.
Encyclopedia Britannica. Art. Archil. The manner of cultiva|tion
and of the extraction of the colouring matter from the leaves
of the&s;e plants may be al&s;o &s;een in Bomare's Dictionaire Rai|&s;onne,
and in Chambers's Encyclopedia. It is probable, that
many other plants, as hedy&s;arum, &s;aintfoin, or the broad
thick leaves of phytolacca, might yield a &s;imilar material to
that of indigo, wood, and weld, if properly cultivated and
prepared, as well as other kinds of mo&s;&s;es or lichens to that
above mentioned.</P>
<P>The green colour of perhaps all vegetables, as well as of
tho&s;e from which indigo and woad are produced, is owing to
the blue fecula, which has been obtained for the dyers princi|pally
from tho&s;e plants; and to a yellow material, which is
more fugitive or more ea&s;ily decompo&s;ed, which yellow may
po&s;&s;ibly be owing to iron. This blue fecula is &s;imply obtained
from indigo, as it &s;ub&s;ides from the fluid, in which the plant is
&s;uffered to ferment; and is obtained from woad along with the
cellular parts of the leaves during their fermentation in water,
and beaten into a ma&s;s. It is probable that the blue&s;t kinds of
vegetables may contain the mo&s;t of this fecula.</P>
<P>For dome&s;tic purpo&s;es the juice of the &s;age-leaf, &s;alvia offici|nalis,
has been u&s;ed both to give colour and flavour to chee&s;e;
and the juice of &s;pinach is employed, I am informed, to colour
the green u&s;quebaugh, a favourite dram with the Irish vulgar.
And it is probable, that the leaf of the vine, which bears pur|ple
grapes, might give a &s;imilar colour and a&s;tringent ta&s;te to our
dome&s;tic wines, as the &s;kin of the &s;ame grape gives to the fo|reign
wines made from it; &s;ince the leaves of this wine always
become quite red in autumn, before they fall, probably by the
concentration of their acidity, as their water evaporates un&s;up|plied;
as all blue vegetable juices become green by an admixture
of akali, and red by that of an acid.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="473">
6. Another u&s;e for which leaves are collected by &s;ome gar|deners,
as they fall in autumn from any kinds of trees, is for
the production of heat by fermentation in hot-hou&s;es, or melon-frames,
in&s;tead of oak-bark, after its bitter particles have been
much extracted by the tanner; and it is probable, that many
leaves might be &s;elected, as they will thus undergo fermenta|tion,
which might afford a &s;pirituous drink like &s;mall beer with|out
any di&s;agreeable flavour, or unwole&s;ome material; which
now &s;erve only for manure when gathered into heaps, or by their
&s;low decay on arable lands; or encumber the gra&s;s lands, they
fall upon.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>11. Of Woods.</HEAD>
<P>1. The leaf-buds of trees producing a viviparous offspring
acquire new caudexes, extending from the branches to the
ground, and the intertexture of the&s;e caudexes forms the new
bark over the old one. But the flower-buds acquire no new
caudexes down the bark, as their oviparous progeny does not
adhere to the &s;ide of the parent bud, but falls down when ma|ture,
and &s;trikes root into the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Now as the bark of trees is thus produced along with the
leaf-buds, and is it annually becomes alburnum or &s;ap-wood;
and that &s;ap-wood gradually lo&s;es all vegetable life, and becomes
heart-wood, in follows, that the art of forwarding the growth
of the wood of trees mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in producing and nouri&s;hing the
leaf-buds.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e the roots of trees &s;hould be &s;upplied with
rather more water, than they generally po&s;&s;e&s;s in their mo&s;t na|tural
&s;tate, or the branches &s;hould be &s;prinkled by a water-en|gine;
as moi&s;ture facilitates the production of the new caudexes
of the new leaf-buds probably by le&s;&s;ening the cohe&s;ion of the
cuticle, or mechanically relaxing it, like the cuticle of our
hands when long &s;oaked in water, as well as by &s;upplying them
with more nutriment.</P>
<P>It may &s;ometimes occur, that the cuticle of trees, or exterior
bark, may adhere too &s;trongly, and by not opening in cracks
confine the growth, or prevent the production of the caudexes
<PB N="469" REF="474">
of the new buds. There is annually a new cuticle produced
beneath the old ones, as well as a new bark above the old ones;
hence &s;ome trees have as many cuticles as they are years old,
others ca&s;t them more ea&s;ily, as a &s;nake ca&s;ts its cuticle. When
a number of cuticles thus exi&s;t one over another, it is u&s;eful to
&s;cratch them longitudinally, which will admit the new bark
beneath, con&s;i&s;ting of the caudexes of the various buds to &s;well
out, and form a line more prominent than the other parts of the
trunk of the tree. If crooked young trees be thus &s;cratched
internally in re&s;pect to the curvature, and this repeatedly, I
am informed, that they will gradually become &s;traight, by thus
encouraging the growth within the curvature more than on its
convex &s;ide.</P>
<P>Another method of increa&s;ing the number and vigour of the
leaf-buds, and in con&s;equence of enlarging the wood of a tree,
con&s;i&s;ts in pinching off the flowers, as &s;oon as they appear; a$
the nouri&s;hment is thus &s;upplied to the leaf-buds by the ino&s;cula|tion
of the ve&s;&s;els of the bark, which otherwi&s;e would have been
expended on the flowers, fruit, and &s;eeds. The truth of this
circum&s;tance is not only countenanced by gardeners, who pull off
the flowers of fruit-trees lately planted to encourage their
growth, but al&s;o from the appearance of &s;ickly trees; which are
liable to peri&s;h, when in flower. In this ca&s;e it often happens,
that, after the flowers fade, &s;ome of the leaf-buds continue to
expand, or new ones put out, owing to the &s;upply of nutriment
not being now expended on the flowers.</P>
<P>2. As tall timber trees without branches, and con&s;equent
knots in the timber, are mo&s;t valuable except for &s;hip-building,
this may be certainly effected by planting them near each other;
as then the powerful conte&s;t with each other for light and
air propels them upwards, in&s;tead of producing many lateral
branches; as may be &s;een in many woods, which have not been
too much thinned. For this purpo&s;e &s;ome have planted trees of
le&s;s value though of quicker growth, as pines, among&s;t oaks;
which may be pruned or lopped, if they &s;hade the oaks too
much, and may be finally removed, when the oaks are crowded
by them; whence &s;ingle trees &s;eldom grow &s;o tall as tho&s;e in
woods, and appear &s;tunted, as it is called; which is generally
<PB N="470" REF="475">
a&s;cribed to the cold &s;ea&s;ons, or to their being expo&s;ed more to
the winds; which may perhaps &s;ometimes happen in this nor|thern
climate; or where trees are expo&s;ed to in&s;alubrious air, as near
the &s;ea; or exi&s;t in colder &s;ituations, as on the &s;ummits
of mountains.</P>
<P>Something &s;imilar to this may be &s;een in tu&s;&s;ocks of gra&s;s, or
where too many &s;eeds of wheat have been &s;own near together.
The central part of the knot of wheat or gra&s;s grows much tal|ler
than the external part, &s;o as to give it a conical figure;
which has been by &s;ome a&s;cribed to the central part having been
&s;heltered from the cold by the external ring, but is more gene|rally
owing to the &s;truggle of the internal &s;tems, for the acqui|&s;ition
of light and air.</P>
<P>The Society of Agriculture at Copenhagen, has propo&s;ed
prizes concerning the cultivation of timber for &s;hip building.
One que&s;tion is, whether the nece&s;&s;ary form and degree of
flexion can by any means be given to growing timber without
injuring it? This I imagine may be done by annually &s;cratching
the external bark or cuticle either longitudinally or horizontally
on the &s;outh &s;ide of the part of a tree, which is wi&s;hed to be
curved, as the &s;outh &s;ide of trees are known to grow fa&s;ter
annually than the north &s;ide, as is &s;een by the greater thickne&s;s
of the concentric rings of a tree, when felled and &s;awed into
blocks; and becau&s;e the cuticle bounds the lateral growth of the
trunks of trees, as the &s;kin of animals bounds the growth of the
cellural parts beneath it; and hence that &s;ide of the tree where
the cuticle or exterior bark is frequently &s;cratched through, will
become larger than the other &s;ide of the tree, and tend to bend
it into a curve with the &s;cratched &s;ide outwards. Trees al&s;o
on the out&s;ide rows of woods will &s;pontaneou&s;ly bend outwards
for light and air, and may I &s;u&s;pect be more ea&s;ily formed into
proper curves by the method above propo&s;ed. And where
trees in a wood are at a proper di&s;tance from each other, they
may forcibly be bent by cordage towards each other, and then
by wounding the exterior and interior bark longitudinally, or
perhaps horizontally al&s;o on the exterior &s;ide of the curved part
of the tree, they may be brought into almo&s;t any degree of flexure,
which they will afterwards pre&s;erve as the tree advances.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="476">
Some of the quicker growing trees may be more valuable to
the planter than oaks, and &s;ome in different &s;oils are more valua|ble
than others; as willow-trees in the hedge-rows in moi&s;t
grounds are &s;aid, if headed once in ten years, on an average to
produce each of them one &s;hilling a year. Perhaps the ozier
for ba&s;ket making may be &s;till more advantageous in low grounds;
there is a valuable paper on the planting of them and the choice
of the kinds of them in the Tran&s;actions of the Society of Arts,
Vol. XVI. p. 129, by Mr. Phillips. Perhaps the &s;ugar-maple may
al&s;o be cultivated in this climate to advantage on many barren com|mons,
as on Cannock Heath And certainly pines, as Scotch fir,
might in the&s;e &s;ituations &s;ucceed a&s;toni&s;hingly, as appears by the
plantations of Mr. An&s;on on the barren mountains near his &s;eat
in Stafford&s;hire; and al&s;o from the plantations of the marquis of
Bath at the foot of Wilt&s;hire Downs near Warmin&s;ter, who&s;e
&s;teward, Mr. Davis, has given a valuable account of the profit
of planting Scotch fir in preference to other timber trees; and
finally a&s;&s;erts, &startq;that although fir-timber is worth individually
more per tree than oak or beech of the &s;ame &s;ize, the&s;e trees will
neverthele&s;s grow fa&s;ter and thicker together than any other
trees. Four firs will grow, where but one oak or beech will
grow; for firs are the better, and deciduous trees the wor&s;e,
for being crowded.&endq; I &s;uppo&s;e becau&s;e the branches of the latter
are valuable, but the former is injured by the knots left in the
trunk, where large branches have exi&s;ted. Tran&s;. of Society of
Arts, Vol. XVI. p. 126.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis adds further, I &s;uppose from his own ob&s;ervation,
that &startq;the chalk-hills in Hamp&s;hire are peculiarly proper for
beech; the flinty loams and clays of the &s;ame county for oaks
and a&s;h; the mo&s;&s;y &s;teep fides of the Wilt&s;hire Downs for hazel;
the rugged and almo&s;t naked rocks of Mendip in Somer&s;et&s;hire
near Chedder produce the lime-tree and the walnut in the greate&s;t
luxuriance; and on the highe&s;t parts of the &s;ame Mendip hills,
where no other tree, can &s;tand the &s;ea-breeze, &s;ycamore flou|ri&s;hes
as well as in the mo&s;t fertile vallies. But taking into con|&s;ideration
the general demand of countries, and the peculiarities
of different &s;oils, no kind of wood is &s;o generally profitable for
planting in coppices as ash.&endq; <HI>Ib.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="477">
3. Another thing concerning timber-trees, which ought to be
attended to, is the injury, they are liable to receive from lightning;
which, I am informed, is much more frequent than is generally
&s;upposed; in&s;omuch that in felling mo&s;t woods, e&s;pecially tho&s;e
which grow in wet &s;ituations, very many of the trees are found
to be cracked longitudinally to the great injury of the timber;
to prevent this, pointed wires, as thick as a goo&s;e quill,
&s;hould be attached to a few of the talle&s;t trees of all flouri&s;hing woods
reaching above their &s;ummits, as conductors of lightning. Add
to this that the holes made by wood-peckers, I am told, are
very numerous, and do much injury to the timber of our fo|re&s;ts,
which can only be prevented by de&s;troying that beautiful
and ingenious bird.</P>
<P>4. Woods differ from each other in many re&s;pects, and are
therefore u&s;ed for many other purpo&s;es be&s;ides mechanical ones;
as in colour; whence particular woods are cho&s;en for their beauty
in the con&s;truction of the furniture of hou&s;es, as ro&s;e-wood, a&s;|palathus;
others are u&s;ed in the art of dying, as the Campechy
wood, haematoxylum, and &s;aunders, &s;antalum, and pterocarpus;
and &s;everal others. Other woods differ in their medicinal pro|perties,
as guaicum, quaffia, Campechy wood, and &s;a&s;&s;afras.
Others differ in their chemical properties, affording e&s;&s;sential oils,
as oleum rhodii, and turpentines or bal&s;ams, and tat; and in their
re&s;tringency, as the oak.</P>
<P>5. The oak probably contains much gallie acid, &s;uch as has been
extracted from the galls occa&s;ioned on their leaves by the
punctures or in&s;ects; whence oak boards are &s;aid to corrode the
&s;heets of lead, which are laid on them, and are hence believed
to be improper for the gutter-boards on the roofs of hou&s;es. But
the &s;ap-wood, or external part of all timber, I &s;u&s;pect, mu&s;t be
improper for this purpo&s;e on another account; as, when confined
from much air by the $word$ of lead over it, it mu&s;t lie for many
months in the year in that &s;tate of moi&s;ture, which will favour
the fermentation of the &s;accharine matter, which all &s;ap-wood
contains; and will thence be &s;ubject to the dry rot, as it is
called by architects. This may be long prevented by leaving
proper holes in the walls of all &s;ides the building immediately
under the roof, as has been generally done by tho&s;e itinerant
<PB N="473" REF="478">
bodies of architects, who &s;hewed &s;uch prodigies of genius in
the con&s;truction of cathedrals in this i&s;land, and all over Eu|rope;
and who&s;e &s;ecret identifying words, and confederate
&s;igns, which were nece&s;&s;ary to them in foreign countries, who&s;e
language they had not time to acquire, &s;eems to have given origin
to the modern my&s;teries of Free-ma&s;onry.</P>
<P>The rot of wood might probably be entirely prevented by
&s;oaking dry timber first in lime-water, till it has ab&s;orbed as
much of it as may be; and then after it is dry by &s;oaking it in a
weak &s;olution of vitriolic acid in water; which will unite with
the lime already depo&s;ited in the pores of the timber, and con|vert
it into gyp&s;um; which I &s;uppo&s;e will not only pre&s;erve it
from decay for many centuries, if it be kept dry, but al&s;o render
it le&s;s inflammable, a circum&s;tance worthy attending to in the
con&s;truction of wood-built hou&s;es. I al&s;o conceive that beams
&s;o impregnated would be le&s;s liable to &s;wag, and boards &s;o pre|pared
le&s;s liable to warp. In the immen&s;e &s;alt-mines of Hungary
many large wooden props, which &s;upport the roof, and are per|petually
moi&s;tened with &s;alt water trickling down them, are &s;aid
to have &s;uffered no decay for many centuries.</P>
<P>6. Woods al&s;o differ from each other in their hardne&s;s, or
the general cohe&s;ion of their particles, whence one kind of timber
has obtained the name of iron wood, &s;ideroxylum. Others
differ in the &s;inene&s;s of their con&s;tituent fibres, which &s;hew a
beautifully &s;mooth poli&s;h, when planed, as ro&s;e wood, a&s;pala|thus.</P>
<P>Where the&s;e two properties of hardne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s exi&s;t
together, as in box, buxus &s;empervirens, the wood mu&s;t be pe|culiarly
valuable for the purpo&s;e of making wooden printing
blocks, &s;o well managed at this time by Mr. Bewick of New|ca&s;tle
in his books of Natural Hi&s;tory of Quadrupeds and Birds.</P>
<P>7. Other woods differ in their durability, as cypre&s;s, cedar,
mahogany, are said to be indi&s;tructible by time, or by the de|predation
of in&s;ects. The wood of the cedar of Bermudas,
Juniperus Bermudiana, in which black lead pencils are inclo&s;ed,
is &s;aid not to be eaten by either aerial, terre&s;trial, or marine in|&s;ects,
and is thence u&s;ed in the We&s;t Indies for building ve&s;|&s;els,
<PB N="474" REF="479">
who&s;e bottoms are not penetrated by &s;ea-worms. The un|peri&s;hable
che&s;ts which contain the Egyptian mummies, were of
cypre&s;s, as well as the coffins in which the Athenians are &s;aid by
Thucydides to have buried their heroes. The gates at St.
Peter's at Rome, which had la&s;ted from the time of Con&s;tantine
to that of Pope Eugene the fourth, that is eleven hundred years,
ware of cypre&s;s, and had at that time &s;uffered no decay.</P>
<P>Of these &s;ome are believed to endure longer in water than
others, as alder, be$$la alnus, and is therefore e&s;teemed prefera|ble
for piles to guard the banks of rivers. But Mr. Brindly, the
conductor of the grand trunk canal, a&s;&s;ured me, that he be|lieved
from ob&s;ervation, &startq;that red Riga deal, or pine-wood,
would endure as long as oak in all &s;ituations,&endq; owing perhaps to
its being so full of resin or turpentine.</P>
<P>8. Other woods differ in the degree of the lateral adhe&s;ion of
their longitudinal fibres, as the fir-wood, or deal, pinus, whence
the timber readily &s;plits by wedges. As the moi&s;ture of the at|mo&s;phere
is ab&s;orbed into the pores of the dry cellular membrane,
which connects the longitudinal fibres of the&s;e woods, more than
into those of the longitudinal fibres them&s;elves, they become
much more dilated laterally than extended longitudinally, by the
change of a dry atmo&s;phere to a moi&s;t one; whence by joining
pieces of deal cut cro&s;s-wi&s;e into a rod of &s;ome feet in length,
a very &s;en&s;ible creeping hygrometer was made by Mr. Edgeworth,
de&s;cribed in the Botanic Garden, Vol. II. note on Impatiens.
And as this wood is not liable to be much extended by low de|grees
of heat, when it is impregnated with boiling oil, or co|vered
with varni&s;h, to prevent the acce&s;s of aerial moi&s;ture, the
pendulums of time-keepers have been con&s;tructed of it, which
have not perceptibly lengthened in any variations of the heat or
moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>9. Another circum&s;tance of great con&s;equence, in which woods
differ, is their &s;pecific gravity, as many of them will &s;ink in
water, as oak after it has been long moi&s;tened; and others will
&s;wim with much of their contents above water, as deal, and
hence have been u&s;ed for the con&s;truction of rafts for the pur|po&s;es
of rude navigation; and which are now &s;aid to be con|&s;tructed
in France as engines of war, probably for the de&s;ign of
<PB N="475" REF="480">
&s;uddenly landing troops, hor&s;es, artillery, and provi&s;ions, from
the &s;hips of invading armies on dangerous &s;hores, and for the
certainty of re-embarking them. The&s;e neverthele&s;s can not car|ry
great burthens &s;imply by their &s;pecific levity; but if each piece
of timber could be made hollow, and rendered water-tight, &s;o as
to contain air, which might probably be done by boring them,
and plugging up the ends; or by joining thick boards together
by means of paint and flannel, or caoutchouc, &s;o as to con&s;truct
long &s;quare wooden troughs filled with air, perhaps eight or ten
inches diameter within, and twenty or thirty feet long. If the
junctions of the&s;e could be rendered water-tight, and a number
of &s;uch hollow trunks could be chained loo&s;ely together, and
laid cro&s;s-wi&s;e three or four times over each other, they might
carry very large burthens, not ea&s;ily to be de&s;troyed by &s;torms,
or &s;unk by cannon &s;hot.</P>
<P>10. Another difference of the longitudinal &s;ibres of timber
con&s;i&s;ts in their degree of ela&s;ticity, a circum&s;tance of much
greater con&s;equence to our ance&s;tors in re&s;pect to the art of war
than to the pre&s;ent generation; as their bows for di&s;charging ar|rows,
and the catapulta, or engine for throwing &s;tones, depended
on the recoil of rods or beams of timber forcibly bent into a
curve. For the con&s;truction of bows the yew-tree, taxus, was
u&s;ed in this i&s;land, and was planted in church-yards, probably
for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying the youth of the pari&s;h with bows,
that they might become expert in the u&s;e of them; many of
which have acquired extreme old age, and remain to this day.</P>
<P>11. When tall trees are de&s;igned to be tran&s;planted for the
purpo&s;e of ornamenting a plea&s;ure ground, it is proper to dig a
circular trench round them two or three feet deep in the early
&s;pring; whence many new roots will &s;hoot from tho&s;e, which
have their ends cut off, and thus the ball of earth will be better
held together, when the tree is removed in the &s;ucceeding au|tumn,
and the tree by having previou&s;ly produced &s;o many more
fine ab&s;orbent radicles will be more certain to grow in its new
&s;ituation.</P>
<P>Hence when new grafted fruit-&s;cions on young &s;tocks are de|&s;igned
to remain a few years in the nur&s;ery, before they are de|&s;igned
for &s;ale, &s;ome provident gardeners I am told tran&s;plant
<PB N="476" REF="481">
them every two years, that the root-fibres may be more numer|ous
in a &s;mall compa&s;s, which occa&s;ions them to grow, when
finally tran&s;planted, with more certainty, and with greater vi|gour.</P>
<P>As tran&s;planted trees &s;hould not be &s;et too deep in the ground,
as their growth is then always much checked, as explained in
Sect. XV. 2. 4. they generally require &s;ome kind of props to pre|vent
them from being overturned, or much &s;hook by the winds,
before they have &s;ufficiently extended their roots. As the bark
is the only living part of the tree, it is liable to receive much in|jury
from its confu&s;ion by the pre&s;&s;ure of the props again&s;t it, or
by the &s;trangulation of the bandage which holds it to them.
Hence as the internal wood of a tree is not alive, I remember
many years ago that I fa&s;tened one prop by a &s;trong nail to each
fruit-tree of a &s;mall orchard, which I then planted; and found
the tree &s;upported with much le&s;s apparent injury than in the
u&s;ual manner by three props and adapted cordage.</P>
<P>12. The time for felling timber has generally been in the win|ter
&s;eason, when labourers could be&s;t be &s;pared from other rural
employments, and from the architecture of towns; but it was
long ago ob&s;erved by Mr. S. Pepys in a paper publi&s;hed in the
Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;act. Vol. XVII. p. 455, that the be&s;t time for
felling oaks for &s;hip-building was after having taken off the bark
in the early &s;pring, and having &s;uffered the new foliage to put
forth and die. For by the pullulation of the new buds the &s;ac|charine
matter in the &s;ap-wood or alburnum is expended, and it
then becomes nearly as hard and durable as the heart-wood,
being both le&s;s liable to decay, or to be penetrated by in&s;ects;
which was a curious and ingenious discovery at that time, though
the theory was not well under&s;tood; the truth of which has now
been e&s;tabli&s;hed, I believe, by the experience of a century.</P>
<P>As the bark of trees annually changes into alburnum or &s;ap-wood,
&s;o the alburnum annually changes into lifele&s;s wood;
whence the concentric rings, which are &s;een in the trunks of
trees, when they are felled, are annually produced; and are &s;aid
generally to be thicker on that &s;ide of the trunk, which grows
towards the south, than on the northern &s;ide, and thicker in the
fume$s mo&s;t favourable to vegetation than the contrary. The&s;e
<PB N="477" REF="482">
rings, as they lo&s;e their vegetable life, and at the &s;ame time a
part of their moi&s;ture by evaporation, or ab&s;orption, gradually
become harder and of a darker colour; in&s;omuch that by count|ing
their number, it is &s;aid, that not only the age of the tree,
but that the mildne&s;s or moi&s;ture of each &s;ummer during the time
of its growth may be e&s;timated by the re&s;pective thickne&s;s of the
rings of timber.</P>
<P>13. In the &s;ame manner the central pith al&s;o lo&s;es its vegeta|ble
life, probably after the fir&s;t year; and then gradually be|comes
ab&s;orbed, or &s;o impregnated with ligneous particles, as
not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;urrounding wood. The pith
of a young bud &s;o re&s;embles the brain and &s;pinal marrow of ani|mals
in re&s;pect to its central &s;ituation, that it probably gives out
nerves to every living &s;ibre of the bud; though the&s;e have yet
e&s;caped our eyes and gla&s;&s;es; and thus furni&s;hes the power of
motion, as well as of &s;en&s;ation, to the various parts of the ve|getable
&s;y&s;tem. One curious fact, which I have ob&s;erved, &s;eems
to countenance this conjecture; which is, that the pith of a la&s;t
year's twig communicates to the leaves on each &s;ide of it, but not
to the new buds in the bo&s;oms of tho&s;e leaves; becau&s;e tho&s;e new
buds are each an individual being, generated by the caudex of the
leaf, and mu&s;t therefore po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;en&s;orium of its own. See Sect.
I. 8. and IX. 2. 4.</P>
<P>The pith of trees contains much mucilage, as well as the &s;talks
of annual and perennial plants, whether they are hollow or not;
the pith of a palm-tree, cycas circinalis, is &s;oftened with water,
and pa&s;&s;ed through &s;ieves, and thus forms the &s;agoe of our &s;hops;
it is po&s;&s;ible the large pith of the &s;talks of artichokes, cinara &s;co|lymus,
might be manufactured into a &s;imilar kind of ta&s;tele&s;s mu|cilage;
and the pith of the young &s;hoots of elder, &s;ambucus ni|gra,
might al&s;o po&s;&s;ibly be made into ta&s;tele&s;s mucilage, if pre|viou&s;ly
agitated in cold water to wa&s;h away any acrid material,
as in the preparation of &s;tarch.</P>
<P>14. When we contemplate the manner of the production of
the internal wood of trees from the induration of the &s;ap-wood,
and the annual increa&s;e of the &s;ap-wood from the bark, which was
previou&s;ly generated by the caudexes of the numerous buds;
there would appear to be no natural boundary to the growth of
<PB N="478" REF="483">
trees. But that their trunks, though a mile di&s;tant from each
other, might be enlarged, till they meet together, and cover the
whole earth with ligneous mountains con&s;tructed by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ge|nerations
of vegetable buds; as &s;ome parts of the ocean are
crowded with calcareous rocks, fabricated by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ge|nerations
of coralline in&s;ects!</P>
<P>A very large tree is described by Mr. Adan&s;on in Africa,
which is called by Linneus Adan&s;onia, in honour of that philo|&s;opher;
of which he &s;ays the diameter of the trunk frequently
exceeds twenty-five feet, and the horizontal branches are from
forty-five to fifty-five feet long, and &s;o large, that each branch is
equal to the large&s;t tree in Europe. The breadth of the top is
from 120 to 150 feet; and one of the roots bared only in part
by the wa&s;hing away of the earth by the river, near which it grew,
mea&s;ured 110 feet long, and yet the&s;e &s;tupendous trees do not
exceed 70 feet in height. Voyage to Senegal.</P>
<P>And in this country, when the internal wood is gradually de|tached
from the alburnum, as it decays, as in some old hollow
oaks and willows, &s;o that it does not de&s;troy the tree by the
putrid matter being ab&s;orbed, there &s;eems to be no termination
of the growth of the external remains of the tree, till the wind
blows it down from its want of &s;olid wood to &s;upport it. Of
this kind of hollow tree a remarkable in&s;tance remains in Wel|beck
Park in Nottingham&s;hire, through the middle of which a
coach is &s;aid to have been driven. There is another oak of un|common
dimensions in the fore&s;t of Needwood, called Swilcar
oak, celebrated in an unpubli&s;hed poem by Mr. Mundy, on his
leaving that fore&s;t, and is there &s;aid to be 600 years old.</P>
<P>But the caudexes of buds, which compo&s;e the barks and af|terwards
the timber of trees, differ from the ne&s;ts or cells of the
coralline in&s;ects, which compo&s;e their calcareous rocks beneath
the waves, in this circum&s;tance. The cells of the coralline in|&s;ects,
like the &s;hells of other &s;ea-animals, become harder by time,
changing by &s;low degrees the pho&s;phoric acid, which they con|tain,
for carbonic acid; and &s;ome of them afterwards for &s;iliceous
acid, and are thus converted into lime&s;tone and flint, and remain
eternal monuments of departed animal life.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="484">
Whil&s;t the remaining va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, after the death of vege|table
buds, like the flesh of animals, undergoes in proce&s;s of time
a chemical decompo&s;ition, and lo&s;es by fermentation and putre|faction
both their carbonic and pho&s;phoric acids, which proba|bly
gave them their &s;olidity, and crumble into du&s;t; which is
&s;een in the rotten trunks of trees, which lo&s;e so much of
their carbon as they decay; and al&s;o become luminous, when ex|po&s;ed
to the air by the e&s;cape or production of pho&s;phoric acid.
And finally, their other component parts are &s;eparated by elu|triation,
and form mora&s;&s;es; whence coals, iron, clay, and
&s;and&s;tone; all which are found on the lime-rocks, which were
previou&s;ly generated in the ocean, and remain eternal monuments
of departed vegetable life. Whence it appears, that a boundary
is &s;et to the &s;ize of trees by their internal decay, but none to the
growth of coral-rocks, which are &s;o formidable in the naviga|tion
of the &s;outhern ocean.</P>

<HEAD>15. Question on the cultivation of Timber.</HEAD>
<P>The political advantage or di&s;advantage of cultivating timber
in this i&s;land &s;hould be here con&s;idered. In the pre&s;ent in&s;ane
&s;tate of human &s;ociety, when war and its preparations employ
the ingenuity and labour of almo&s;t all nations; and mankind
de&s;troy or en&s;lave each other with as little mercy, as they de|&s;troy
and en&s;lave the be&s;tial world; and may in time for what
appears to the contrary, return to their &s;avage &s;tate, and begin
to eat each other again, as &s;eems to have occured at or before
the commencement of almo&s;t all civil &s;ocieties; the fir&s;t political
attention &s;hould certainly in this period of human infatuation be
employed to &s;trengthen the country, to enable it to repel the in|va&s;ion
of foreign enemies, and to defend its natural rights,
when they are infringed by them; but not to attack or invade
other nations for any predatory or ambitious purpo&s;e. The
next important thing &s;hould be for this nation to &s;et a great
example of ju&s;tice and humanity to all contending nations, and
thence again to introduce truth and virtue into the world with
peace and happine&s;s in their train.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="485">
Now as the power to re&s;i&s;t inva&s;ion, and to defend our na|tural
rights, when infringed by foreign enemies, mu&s;t depend
more on the number of men than on the number of trees; there
need be no he&s;itation in determining that tho&s;e lands which can
be employed in the pre&s;ent production of vegetable or animal
food, &s;hould not be occupied in the tedious cultivation of future
timber.</P>
<P>But that, as the &s;ummits of this country con&s;i&s;t principally
of a ridge of mountains extending from &s;outh to north between
the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern &s;eas, as tho&s;e of the Peak of Derby&s;hire
and the Moorlands of Stafford&s;hire, which are &s;o bleak or &s;o
barren as to be totally unfit for the plough or for pa&s;turage, and
yet might be employed for rai&s;ing variety of timbers; which
from our great &s;ucc$&s;ies in naval engagements may be termed
with great propriety, which employed in building &s;hips, the
wooden walls of this i&s;land: All tho&s;e unfertile mountains
from the extremity of Cornwall to the extremity of Scotland,
&s;hould be covered with exten&s;ive fore&s;ts of &s;uch kinds of wood,
as experience has &s;hewn them to be capable to &s;ustain, and
which may be be&s;t adapted to the con&s;truction of &s;hips.</P>

a very tall tree, which mea&s;ures thirteen yards round at its
ba&s;e, and eleven yards round at four feet from the ground, and

<Q>I. Flowers from &s;eeds. 1. <HI>Double flowers from &s;eeds. Here|ditary
di&s;ea&s;es in plants. Full flowers have no &s;tamina. Three
kinds of double columbine. Vegetable mon&s;ters analogous to ani|mal
mules.. The &s;tamen, pi&s;til, and calyx, are the mo&s;t unchange|able
parts. Double flowers di&s;tingui&s;hed by the calyx, are much
more durable than &s;ingle ones. Double poppies yield more opium.
Annual in&s;ects. 2. The colours of &s;ingle flowers from &s;eed
how varied, Variegation of foliage. Vegetable juices are
hyper-oxygenated. This fluid oxygen is converted into gas by
the &s;un's light; which therefore colours living vegetables, and
bleaches dead ones.</HI> II. 1. Flowers from buds. <HI>Double ones
how cau&s;ed. Surround the bud with water. Oil, and con&s;erve
of ro&s;es. Their double flowers. Acquired habits. 2. How
to vary the colour of &s;ingle &s;hrub-flowers, by anther-du&s;t, by ino|culation.
Trees how variegated by ingraftment, or made into
evergreens. 3. How to increa&s;e the number of flowers.</HI> III.
1. Flowers from roots. <HI>Bulb-rooted flowers. To cau&s;e
their duplicature, break of the flower, rai&s;e them out of
the ground. 2. Single bulb-rooted flowers. To increa&s;e them
in &s;ize or number, take away offsets, crowd their roots.
Propagation by offsets. By &s;eeds. How broken into colours.
Plant them in different &s;oils. Tulips break into colours from age.</HI>
3. <HI>Perennial branching roots. Duplicature of their flowers,
propagated by offsets, by &s;eeds. Their &s;ingle flowers. How
broken into colours. By &s;eeds, by tran&s;planting.</HI> IV. E&s;cu|lent
and medicinal flowers. <HI>Vegetable mucilage coagulated by
boiling in water, in &s;team. They lo&s;e their green colour in &s;team,
Why? Artichoke-&s;talks. 2. Cultivation of brocoli. Knobs on
its roots. 3. Hep. Camomile. Their duplicature.</HI> V. Flowers
u&s;ed in the arts. <HI>For dying, ornotto. For &s;pinning, cotton,
<PB N="483" REF="488">
cotton-rush, cat's-tail.</HI> VI. Nutritious parts of vegetables.
1. <HI>Mushrooms. Gluten of Wheat. Oils. 2. Sugar. Muci|lage.
Oil. 3. Starch. Meal. 4. Alburnum. Barks. Roots
of fern and of bryony. 5. Immature flowers. Honey. Leaf|&s;talks.
Leaves. Re&s;ervoirs of nutriment.</HI> VII. Happine&s;s
of organized nature. 1. <HI>Seeds and eggs have not &s;en&s;itive life.
Milk gives two-fold plea&s;ure. Dull animals and di&s;ea&s;ed vege|tables
peri&s;h, and give life to more &s;en&s;ible ones. Old age unknown
before &s;ociety. Mi&s;ery is not immortal. 2. Animal ab&s;orption
and &s;ecretion is attended with agreeable &s;en&s;ation. Renders mat|ter
more &s;olid. The &s;ame in vegetables. 3. Strata of lime&s;tone
formed from animal &s;hells. The&s;e of coal, clay, &s;and, from
vegetable &s;ecretions, gave plea&s;ure at the time of their production;
and are monuments of pa&s;t felicity, and of the benevolence of the
Deity.</HI> VIII. Cultivation of brocoli, <HI>a poem.</HI></Q>
<P>THE beautiful colours of the petals of flowers with their po|li&s;hed
&s;urfaces are &s;carcely rivalled by tho&s;e of &s;hells, of feathers,
or of precious &s;tones. Many of the&s;e tran&s;ient beauties, which
give &s;uch brilliancy to our gardens, delight at the &s;ame time the
&s;ense of &s;mell with their odours; yet have they not been exten|&s;ively
u&s;ed as articles either of diet, medicine, or the arts. For
the purpo&s;e of cultivation they may be divided into tho&s;e imme|diately
derived from &s;eeds, tho&s;e from buds, and tho&s;e from roots;
to which may be added the e&s;culent and medicinal
ones, and tho&s;e u&s;ed in the arts.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>I. Flowers from Seeds.</HEAD>
<P>1. The eye of the flori&s;t is frequently delighted with double
flowers, which &s;hew a greater blaze of colour in a &s;mall &s;pace,
and continue &s;ome weeks longer in blow than &s;ingle ones; and,
though they are properly called vegetable mon&s;ters by the bota|ni&s;ts,
may give information to the philo&s;opher in re&s;pect to the
&s;exual generation of vegetables. The method therefore of pro|ducing
double flowers from &s;eeds is a matter of importance, as
well as the art of giving to both the&s;e and the &s;ingle flowers their
mo&s;t healthy expan&s;ion, and the greate&s;t brilliancy and variety
of their colours</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="489">
Though tho&s;e multiplied flowers, which are &s;aid to be full,
po&s;&s;e&s;s no &s;tamens, or pi&s;tils, and con&s;equently can produce no
&s;eeds; yet are they frequently rai&s;ed immediately from &s;eeds;
for tho&s;e flowers, which are cultivated with more manure, moi&s;|ture,
and warmth, than is natural, become more vigorous and
larger, and at the &s;ame time are liable to &s;hew a tendency to
become double, by having one or two &s;upernumerary petals
in each flower, as the &s;tock July-flower, cheiranthus, and ane|mone.
And what is truly curious, this tendency to duplicature
is communicated to the &s;eeds of tho&s;e individual blo&s;&s;oms; in&s;o|much
that flori&s;ts are directed to tie a thread round &s;uch flowers,
which have a &s;upernumerary petal, to mark them, and to collect
their &s;eeds &s;eparately; which are &s;aid uniformly to produce
double or full flowers, if cultivated as above with rather more
manure, moi&s;ture, and warmth, than tho&s;e plants have naturally
been accu&s;tomed to.</P>
<P>The analogy of this circum&s;tance with the hereditary di&s;ea&s;es
of animals is truly wonderful; as the children of tho&s;e parents,
who have acquired the gout or drop&s;y by intemperance in the
u&s;e of fermented or &s;pirituous potations, become afflicted with
tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, as I have frequently ob&s;erved, in a much greater
degree by the &s;ame quantity of intemperance, which originally
produced them in their parents; or they acquire the &s;ame quan|tity
of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es by a le&s;s degree of intemperance, than oc|ca&s;ions
them in others, who&s;e parents have not u&s;ed fermented
or &s;pirituous liquors to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>The luxuriance of flowers, which is believed to ari&s;e from
their cultivation in more nutritive &s;oils with greater moi&s;ture,
and warmth, con&s;i&s;ts in the increa&s;e of &s;ome parts of the flower,
and the con&s;equent exclu&s;ion of others; and is di&s;tingui&s;hed by
Linnaeus into the multiplication and plenitude of flowers, and
into proliferous ones. Multiplied flowers con&s;i&s;t of double, tri|ple,
or quadruple corols; but full flowers are &s;o multiplied as
to exclude the &s;tamina; while in proliferous ones other flowers
ari&s;e from within the principal flower, and frequently from its
center. Philo&s;. Botan. p. 80.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;tamina of &s;ome double flowers are converted into petals; but on examination, I &s;u&s;pect that the
<PB N="485" REF="490">
number of petals is increa&s;ed, and the &s;tamina prevented from
growing by being compre&s;&s;ed by them in their na&s;cent &s;tate;
as in many of them, I believe, the rudiments of &s;ome &s;tamina
may be &s;een, as in ranunculus. So when a new flower ri&s;es in
the center of the old one, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the pi&s;tillum is
converted into the &s;tem of a new flower, as in proliferous dai&s;y,
bellis prolifera; but I &s;u&s;pect, that the pi&s;tillum is prevented
from ri&s;ing by the immoderate growth of the new flower-&s;tem;
as in &s;ome of them, I am told, the rudiment of the pi&s;tillum
may be perceived.</P>
<P>Thus monopetalous flowers are doubled or multiplied by the
increa&s;ed divi&s;ions of the limb, as ob&s;erved by Linnaeus, Philo&s;.
Botan. p. 83, who adds, that the metamorpho&s;is of Engli&s;h
&s;oapwort is very &s;ingular, as its five petals are transformed
into one petal, and that in opulus flore globo&s;o the cen|tral
florets become &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the circumference,
acquiring wheeled corols, and being barren: in the&s;e ca&s;e&s; the
&s;tamens cannot be changed into corols, as the number of corols
is not increa&s;ed. Afterwards, in p. 84, the &s;ame illu&s;trious
author ob&s;erves, that in double lychnis the rudiment of the com|mon
pi&s;til is pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The luxuriance of flowers therefore con&s;i&s;ts in the multipli|cation
of the corols or nectaries, which la&s;t are properly an
appendage to the former; and the prevention of the growth of
the male and female organs is the con&s;equence. Thus the flower
of aquilegia, columbine, has three kinds of plenitude: 1. the pe|tals
become multiplied, and the nectaries excluded; 2. the
nectaries are multiplied, and the petals excluded; 3. the nec|taries
are multiplied, the petals remaining. So that there are
five petals, and between each of the&s;e three nectaries, which
exi&s;t within each other.</P>
<P>A curious analogy here al&s;o exi&s;ts between the&s;e vegetable
mon&s;ters and tho&s;e of the animal world; as a duplicature of
limbs frequently attends the latter, as chickens and turkeys with
four legs and four wings, and calves with two heads. And in
mules the parts &s;ub&s;ervient to generation become deficient,
whence they cannot propagate their &s;pecies; exactly as in the&s;e
full flowers, which can thence produce no &s;eed. And in re&s;pect
<PB N="486" REF="491">
to botanic &s;y&s;tems, it may be ob&s;erved from the&s;e vegetables of
luxuriant growths, that the &s;tamens and pi&s;tils are le&s;s liable to
change than the corols and nectaries, and are therefore more
proper parts for the cla&s;&s;ification of plants; on which idea Lin|naeus
has con&s;tructed his unrivalled &s;y&s;tem. And la&s;tly that
the calyx, or perianth, is the next mo&s;t unchangeable part of
the flower, as this is &s;eldom doubled or multiplied; and that
hence by in&s;pecting the calyx the genera of many double flowers
may be detected; thus the double ranunculus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a calyx,
but the double anemone is without one, like the &s;ingle ones of
tho&s;e genera.</P>
<P>The greater duration of double flowers than &s;ingle ones is &s;o
remarkable in &s;ome poppies, that their &s;ingle flowers lo&s;e the
corolla in a few hours, while in the double ones it continues
&s;everal days: this circum&s;tance is well worthy the attention of
tho&s;e, who cultivate poppies for the purpo&s;e of wounding the
head, which inclo&s;es the &s;eeds, for the opium, which thus ex|&s;udes.
As poppies with double flowers may probably be capa|ble
of yielding opium, before they &s;hed their flowers, and as
long as other poppies, after they &s;hed them, Dr. Smith a&s;cribes
this event to the organs of reproduction being obliterated, and
the con&s;equent want of impregnation; by the great &s;timulus of
which he thinks the vegetable irritability may be &s;ooner exhau&s;t|ed
in &s;ingle flowers: and adds, &startq;that on the &s;ame account
many plants re&s;i&s;t a greater degree of cold for &s;everal winters
before flowering; but after that event they peri&s;h at the fir&s;t
approach of cold, and can by no art be pre&s;erved &s;o as to &s;ur|vive
the winter.&endq; And repeats an ob&s;ervation from Linnaeus,
that the pi&s;tilla of the female hemp, cannabis, continued much
longer to exi&s;t when not expo&s;ed to the male pollen, than tho&s;e
pi&s;tilia on which the pollen had been effu&s;ed. Tracts on Nat.
Hi&s;t. p. 177.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that many in&s;ects may be called annual
ones as well as many vegetables, and die, as soon as they have
provided the eggs or &s;eeds for the reproduction of their &s;pecies,
as the &s;ilkworm, and I &s;uppo&s;e, all the kinds of moths and but|terflies;
many of which take no food at all, after they have ac|quired
their organs of generation and their amatorial pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="487" REF="492">
and yet appear fat and active; and others live only upon honey,
and &s;eem to die as &s;oon as that pa&s;&s;ion is gratified, probably from
having no further plea&s;urable &s;timulus to excite the animal
power into activity, rather than from its total exhau&s;tion; be|cau&s;e
other animals, who&s;e exi&s;tence is not naturally &s;o &s;hort,
are not injured or de&s;troyed by the moderate u&s;e of the powers
of reproduction; and that power leaves them long before their
death. An experiment to &s;hew, whether the moths of &s;ilk|worms
would live longer if deprived of their paramours, might
be worth the attention of naturali&s;ts; and al&s;o, whether the
butterflies of our climate might not be pre&s;erved during the
winter, if fed with honey like bees, and kept from exce&s;&s;ive
cold. I directed &s;ome honey to be offered to the &s;ilkworm-butterflies,
which they would not attend to, though they may
probably &s;eek for it in their native climates.</P>
<P>2. Varieties in the colours of &s;ingle flowers rai&s;ed from &s;eeds
may probably be generally acquired by &s;owing near together
tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;pecies, which already po&s;&s;e&s;s different co|lours;
&s;o that during the di&s;per&s;ion of their anther-du&s;t by the
wind, or otherwi&s;e, they may intermix and adulterate each
other. Or this may be more certainly effected by bending the
flowers of one colour, and &s;haking the anther-du&s;t over
tho&s;e of another colour. In this manner, I &s;uppo&s;e, it happens, that
the beds of centaurea cyanus become of &s;uch various and beau|tiful
&s;hades of blues, purples, and whites.</P>
<P>Another method of giving variety of colours to &s;eedling
flowers con&s;i&s;ts in &s;owing them on natural &s;oils, or on factitious
compo&s;ts, which differ much from each other in re&s;pect to vege|table
nutriment, and perhaps in re&s;pect to their colour, as &s;ome
animals change their natural colours whenin different &s;ituations
of &s;oil. As frogs much re&s;emble the colour of the &s;oil on which
they live, and our dome&s;ticated hor&s;es, dogs, cats, rabbits,
pigeons, and poultry, change their colours into endle&s;s varieties,
owing to the difference of their nutriment or &s;ituation. But
ob&s;ervations and experiments are wanting on this &s;ubject in re|&s;pect
to the colours of &s;eedling flowers, as well as in re&s;pect to
the variegation of the leaves of &s;hrubs and trees; which la&s;t ori|ginates
<PB N="488" REF="493">
probably from &s;oil or &s;ituation, and may be propagated
by ingrafting.</P>
<P>As the origin of double flowers is believed to re&s;ult from the
luxuriant growth of the plant, owing to too much nouri&s;hment,
moi&s;ture, and warmth, &s;o the origin of new colours in flowers,
and of variegated foliage, is thought to occur from the innutri|tion
of the &s;oil, on which they grow, compared to that which
they have naturally been accu&s;tomed to, or from defect of moi&s;|ture
and of heat; which is countenanced by the dwarfi&s;h size
of &s;uch plants in general, and e&s;pecially by the le&s;&s;ened &s;tature
of tulips, when their petals break into variety of colours.</P>
<P>The proximate cau&s;e of the change of colours in flowers or
foliage mu&s;t be &s;ought from the modern acqui&s;itions of aerial
chemi&s;try. The pre&s;ence of oxygen gas deprives dead vegeta|ble
fibres, as cotton-wool and the threads of flax, of their co|lour;
that is, it bleaches them; which is probably owing to
its uniting with the colouring matter and forming a new acid,
which is tran&s;parent. Thus the hyper-oxygenated muriatic
acid almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly deprives cotton and linen of their
colour; and the &s;un's light on moi&s;tened linen &s;pread upon the
ground &s;eems to decompo&s;e the water, and the oxygen thus
detached whitens the linen. The etiolation or blanching of
living vegetables on the contrary &s;eems to originate from the
want of the &s;un's light to convert into gas the fluid oxygen;
which, by di&s;&s;olving their colouring matter, and forming new
and perhaps ta&s;tele&s;s acids, deprives them of colour. Hence
the water, which vegetables per&s;pire in the &s;un&s;hine, becomes
hyper-oxygenated, which has much puzzled philo&s;ophers to
account for; and the oxygen ri&s;es from it without decompo&s;ing
it; which la&s;t circum&s;tance is evinced by the total ab&s;ence of the
&s;mell of hydrogen, which &s;o powerfully affects our no&s;trils, when
a &s;poonful of water is thrown on burning coals.</P>
<P>Now as plants, which grow le&s;s vigorou&s;ly from defect of
nutriment, moi&s;ture, air, or warmth, may acquire or po&s;&s;e&s;s
le&s;s oxygen to di&s;&s;olve their colouring matter, their &s;tructure may
approach towards that of dead vegetables; and hence they may
become bleached in&s;tead of coloured by the influence of the &s;un's
light, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts where their vital functions are
<PB N="489" REF="494">
performed with le&s;s vigour; &s;o an etiolated vegetable, as a
blanched plant of celery, apium graveolens, becomes green in
a few days, when expo&s;ed to the light and air; and white again,
if deprived of life, and expo&s;ed to the &s;un&s;hine and dews.</P>
<P>The immediate cau&s;e of the various colours of &s;ome flowers,
as of poppies, might be a &s;ubject of curious inve&s;tigation. I
once &s;uppo&s;ed, that the thinne&s;s of the pellicle of &s;ome flowers
might occa&s;ion them to reflect different colours, as is &s;een on
dropping a drop of oil from a bridge on the water below on a
bright day. But colours thus produced vary with the &s;ituation
of the ob&s;erver, in re&s;pect to the obliquity or angle of reflection,
in which they are &s;een; and are thence variable with every
motion of them, as tho&s;e colours &s;een on &s;oap-bubbles, and on
mother-pearl, and on the Labradore-&s;tone, and on &s;ome &s;ilks.
For tho&s;e colours depend on the thinne&s;s of the reflecting &s;ur|face,
which when &s;een more obliquely become thicker; and
then reflects tho&s;e colours, which pa&s;&s;ed through thinner plates;
in the &s;ame manner as the red light of the &s;etting &s;un is reflected
from gla&s;s windows, &s;een very obliquely by the ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>The colours of flowers therefore, as they are not variable by
the obliquity, with which they are &s;een, like tho&s;e of mother-pearl
card-fi&s;h, do not depend on the thinne&s;s of their pellicle;
but, I &s;uppo&s;e, to the greater facility that &s;ome parts of them
po&s;&s;e&s;s in parting with their oxygen, when expo&s;ed to the &s;un's
light, than other parts of them; for all flowers are more or le&s;s
etiolated, before they fir&s;t open. In the &s;ilk manufactory a
variable colour is produced by making the warp of one colour
and the woof of another; perhaps the variable colour of a pea|cock's
tail may be owing to a mixture of different coloured
down placed in lines near each other.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>II. Flowers from Buds.</HEAD>
<P>1. The flowers ari&s;ing from the buds of &s;hrubs or trees are
liable to become double or full by the multiplication of their
petals, as tho&s;e of ro&s;es, cherries, hawthorn, peach, ro&s;a, pru|nus,
cera&s;us, crategus oxyacantha, amygdalus per&s;ica. Which
tendency to duplicature, as in the flowers of annual plants, is
<PB N="490" REF="495">
probably owing to the too vigorous growth of the bud from a
too nutritious &s;oil, or the combination of abundant moi&s;ture and
warmth, and would probably be forwarded by &s;urrounding the
bud it&s;elf frequently with water; as is &s;o beautifully &s;een in tho&s;e
plants, which have a cup round their joints to pre&s;erve for a
time the rain, which falls upon them, as round the joints of
dyp&s;acus, tea&s;el, &s;ilphium, tilland&s;ia, and nepenthes.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that though the duplicature of many flowers
is believed to have been owing to the more nutritious &s;oil, in
which they have been cultivated, yet that, when tran&s;planted
into le&s;s fertile &s;oils, or ingrafted on le&s;s luxuriant trees, they
&s;till retain their tendency to duplicature, which can only be a&s;|cribbed
to the continuance of an acquired habit, or to the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of hereditary di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o frequently ob&s;erved in the animal
&s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>This duplicature of flowers from buds is generally propagated
by ingrafting the &s;cions of &s;uch, as bear multiplied petals, on
&s;imilar plants, which bear &s;ingle flowers; and may be of &s;ervice
not only for beauty, but for the purpo&s;e of increa&s;e in tho&s;e
plants, the petals of who&s;e flowers are con&s;umed for any pur|po&s;e,
as the leaves of ro&s;es. A gentleman at Nottingham an|nually
di&s;tils a profitable quantity of e&s;&s;ential oil of ro&s;es, by
collecting all of them he can purcha&s;e in the neighbourhood
during the &s;ea&s;on; and this by the u&s;ual proce&s;s, which is not
difficult though tedious. And a &s;urgeon at Stafford has intro|duced
an agreeable and profitable kind of agriculture, by plant|ing
half an acre of ground with red ro&s;es, and converting the flowers into con&s;erve with &s;ugar, or by &s;imply drying them
for the London market.</P>
<P>2. It is probable, that numerous varieties of colour in the
&s;ingle flowers of &s;hrubs, as well as tho&s;e of annual plants, might
be obtained by &s;haking the anther-du&s;t of one variety over the
&s;tigma of another, where any difference of colour already exi&s;ts
in the &s;ame &s;pecies. And perhaps &s;ome changes of colour of
the flowers might be produeed by inoculating the buds of a
&s;hrub, who&s;e flowers are of one colour, into the branches of
another variety of the &s;ame &s;pecies or genus; as the variegation
of the foliage of plants is &s;aid to have been produced in this
manner, according to the a&s;&s;ertions of Mr. Bradley and Mr.
<PB N="491" REF="496">
Laurence, who budded a &s;potted pa&s;&s;ion-flower and a &s;triped
ja&s;mine on tho&s;e, which were not variegated, and produced a
&s;imilar variegation of them, as related in Sect. V. 1. This has
been a&s;cribed to the ab&s;orption of &s;ome infectious matter from
the inoculated bud, which propagated a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e to the
whole tree; and has thence been u&s;ed as an argument in favour
of a vegetable circulation of the juices.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar fact is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted by Mr. Milne. He &s;ays, that
&startq;an evergreen tree ingrafted on a deciduous one determines the
latter to retain its leaves; this ob&s;ervation is confirmed by re|peated
experiments, particularly by grafting the laurel, lauro|cera&s;us,
an evergreen, on the common cherry, cera&s;us; or the
ilex, an evergreen oak, on the common oak.&endq; Botanical Dict.
Art. Defoliatio. All the&s;e &s;eem to want further experiments
to authenticate the facts &s;o delivered on the authority of ingeni|ous
men.</P>
<P>3. To increa&s;e the number of the flowers of &s;hrubs, all tho&s;e
arts are applicable, which are de&s;cribed in Sect. XV. 2. for the
production of fruit on wall trees; which, when the tree is of a
proper age, con&s;ist, 1. in bending down the viviparous branches
to the horizon, which renders them oviparous; 2. by twi&s;ting
a wire, or tying a cord round the viviparous branches; 3. by wounding or cutting away a narrow cylinder of the bark; 4. by
tran&s;planting or cutting off &s;ome of the roots; 5. by cutting away
the central or viviparous branches; 6. by ingrafting.</P>

<HEAD>III. Flowers from Roots.</HEAD>
<P>1. Many bulb-rooted flowers are de&s;ervedly in great e&s;tima|tion
by flori&s;ts, as the tulip, hyacinth, lily, colchicum, crocus,
fritillary, &amp;c. and of tho&s;e many are liable to become double,
which adds in general &s;o much to their &s;plendour and to their
duration, as narci&s;&s;us, hyacinth, colchicum, tulip.</P>
<P>The immediate cau&s;e of duplicature or multiplication of the
petals of the&s;e flowers is probably &s;imilar to that of tho&s;e above
mentioned, and originates from their luxuriant growth, owing
to the fertility of the &s;oil, and the abundance of moi&s;ture and of
warmth in combination.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="497">
Other circum&s;tances, which may add to their luxuriant
growth, may al&s;o contribute to their duplicature; &s;uch as by
breaking off the flower as &s;oon as it begins to fade; and thus, by
preventing the nutritious vegetable juices from being expended in
the growth of the &s;eeds, more of it may be derived to the prin|cipal
&s;ucceeding bulb.</P>
<P>Thus it is a&s;&s;erted, that the preventing &s;ome annual plants from
flowering lengthens their lives, which it may effect by occa&s;ion|ing
them to produce new root-&s;cions, and thus to become peren|nial
vegetables. The very ingenious Mr. Bogle, in the papers
of the Bath Society, believes that wheat, oats, and barley, may
be made perennials, if they are eaten down by cattle or &s;heep,
or cat by the &s;cythe or &s;ickle, &s;o as to prevent them from pro|ducing
ears.</P>
<P>As tulip-bulbs rai&s;ed from &s;eed produce a larger bulb the &s;uc|ceeding
year, and again a larger with a different leaf on the third
year, and &s;o on till the fifth or &s;ixth, the bulbs thus annually
improving till they flower; and even after they flower they are
believed to continue to improve for &s;ome years, till the colour of
the petals become &s;triped: I &s;u&s;pect that the art of procuring a
great duplicature of the petals of the&s;e flowers con&s;i&s;ts in break|ing
off the flower-&s;tem on the fifth, &s;ixth, and &s;eventh years,
from the &s;owing of the &s;eed; that is, for a year, or two, or
three, after the flower-&s;tem fir&s;t appears, as noted in Sect. VIII.
1. 3. And that the tendency to duplicature will continue in the
&s;ucceeding bulbs by the acquired habit, as in the hereditary di&s;|ea&s;es of animals.</P>
<P>And &s;econdly, the&s;e flower-roots become more luxuriant by
rai&s;ing them out of the ground, as &s;oon as the leaves wither,
which are the parents of the new bulbs; and then by taking
away the &s;maller or collateral new bulbs from the principal one,
which might otherwi&s;e incommode its growth by their vicinity,
and con&s;equent compre&s;&s;ion, both the&s;e methods are of equal
u&s;e to enlarge and render more vigorous the &s;ingle flowers of
bulb-roots, as well as to increa&s;e their tendency to duplicature.</P>
<P>2. The &s;ingle flowers of &s;ome of the&s;e plants may be probably
not only enlarged, but &s;o &s;trengthened as to ripen their &s;eeds
in this climate, by nicely laying bare the root, and taking from
<PB N="493" REF="498">
it the new progeny; whether a &s;ingle new bulb, as in orchis
ma&s;cula, or the numerous ones of hyacinth, tulip, or lily of the
valley; as by the&s;e means the vegetable nutriment is not ex|pended
on the new bulbs, and probably more of it may thence
be derived to the flower. See Sect. XVII. 1. 3.</P>
<P>Another method of increa&s;ing the bulb-rooted flowers in &s;ize
or number con&s;i&s;ts in crowding their roots in garden-pots, or
by not annually tran&s;planting them; and thus by preventing their
offsets from being formed, or by decrea&s;ing the number or vigour
of them; thus lily of valley, and jonquil, &s;eldom afford large
or numerous flowers, till they have remained three or four years
in the &s;ame &s;ituation; but mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be then occa&s;ionally
in part tran&s;planted, lea&s;t the roots &s;hould die from being &s;o
crowded as not to &s;orm each of them one annual new bulb,
which is their mode of reproduction.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual method of propagating bulbous roots has been by
the &s;maller offsets, which are formed annually round the princi|pal
or central new bulb, as in tulips; which central new bulb has
commonly been mi&s;taken for the old root; by this mode of pro|pagation
the &s;imilarity of the new progeny to the parent is nicely
pre&s;erved; and on that account &s;ome of the&s;e new roots of
tulips and hyacinths hive been &s;old at extravagant prices. For
the circum&s;tance of this mode of reproduction &s;ee Sect. IX. 3. 2.</P>
<P>But in re&s;pect to producing variety of colour in the &s;ingle
flowers of bulbous roots, the mo&s;t effectual method, I &s;uppo&s;e,
mu&s;t be by &s;owing their &s;eeds, and waiting a few years, till their
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive bulbs at length produce flowers, as de&s;cribed in Sect.
XVII. 1. 2. and particularly if the anther-du&s;t of one variety in
re&s;pect to colour be &s;hed on the &s;tigma of another variety.</P>
<P>Another method of producing a change or variety of colours
in bulb-rooted flowers may be by planting them every year, till
they flower, on very nutritious &s;oil, with an abundant combina|tion
of moi&s;ture and of heat, as the&s;e two elements &s;hould exi&s;t
together to effect the mo&s;t luxuriant growth of vegetables. And
after they have flowered, or on the year in which they are ex|pected
to flower, they &s;hould be tran&s;planted on a le&s;s nutritive
&s;oil, with le&s;s heat and moi&s;ture. Or probably this le&s;s quantity
<PB N="494" REF="499">
of nutriment, heat and moi&s;ture, might be u&s;ed at the commence|ment
of their growth, or even at &s;owing their &s;eed, with &s;imilar
effect of &s;ooner breaking into a variety of colours.</P>
<P>The beauty of the double yellow tulip, and its greater longe|vity,
much recommend it to common eyes; but the endle&s;s va|riety
in the colours of &s;ingle tulips has long and de&s;ervedly been
the admiration of flori&s;ts. The curious event of their breaking
into various colours from an uniform purple, a year or two after
their fir&s;t flowering, and at the &s;ame time of their lo&s;ing nearly
one third of the height of their &s;tems, &s;eems to indicate that this
effect re&s;ults not from the debility of age, but from the acqui&s;i|tion
of hereditary di&s;ea&s;es, as the&s;e new colours, into which
they break, afterwards remain for uncounted generations, and
may in this re&s;pect be compared to the canker in apple-trees,
mentioned in Sect. XIV. 1. 3.</P>
<P>This change of colour from darker to lighter in tulips may
probably be accelerated or increa&s;ed by keeping the roots long
out of the ground in dry or warm apartments, &s;o as to harden
their fibres, and dimini&s;h the diameters of their &s;ecreting ve&s;&s;els,
and thereby hindering their ab&s;orption of colouring molecules,
&s;imilar to grey hairs produced on animals by age or external in|jury
of the part. This would &s;eem to obtain in tulips, as when
they break into colours, they lo&s;e one third of their &s;ize, and
con&s;equently the diameters of their &s;ecretory and of their ab&s;or|bent
ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t be much dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>New kinds of varieties in the &s;ituations or production of white
parts of the petals of flowers might be cau&s;ed, I &s;u&s;pect, by
compre&s;&s;ing &s;ome parts of them before the flower opens, by ty|ing
fine threads round the calyx, which inclo&s;es them; as many
darker coloured cats and dogs have all tho&s;e parts lighter or quite
white, which have been compre&s;&s;ed together, as they lay in their
fetus &s;tate in the uterus; an in&s;tance of which exi&s;ts in a black
male cat, which now lies upon the hearth, and an in&s;tance of a
black terrier bitch is de&s;cribed in Zoonomia, Vol. II. Cla&s;s. I. 2. 2. 11. This may be worth the attention of flori&s;ts and flower-&s;ellers;
and it is probable, that the white &s;treaks in dark flowers
may have been thus produced by their greater compre&s;&s;ion in the
calyx, before the flower opens.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="500">
3. The cau&s;es of duplicature in perennial flowers with branch|ing
roots, as ranunculus, caltha, hepatica, anemone, cheiranthus,
dianthus, &s;ilene, wallflower, carnation, catchfly, are probably
&s;uch as afford a general luxuriancy of growth to tho&s;e vegeta|bles,
and may be certainly propagated by offsets from tho&s;e roots,
or by laying their branches in the ground, &s;o as to exactly re|&s;emble
their parents. Many of the&s;e double flowers may al&s;o
be procured by collecting the &s;eeds from &s;uch &s;ingle flowers of
the &s;ame &s;pecies, as po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;upernumerary petal; which, if
&s;owed on fertile ground, will pre&s;ent us with double or multi|plied
flowers, as the anemone and July-flower mentioned in No.
I. 1. of this Section.</P>
<P>The effect of breaking the &s;ingle ones into varieties of colour,
which, in anemones and poppies as well as in tulips, are uncom|monly
beautiful, is probably owing to the le&s;s fertility of the
&s;oil, or le&s;s &s;upply of heat and moi&s;ture, where they have hap|pened
to re&s;ide, and that more effectually if they were removed
from more favourable &s;ituations.</P>
<P>The varieties of the &s;ingle flowers al&s;o of tho&s;e roots may be
propagated unchanged, as well as the double ones, by dividing
the roots or tran&s;planting the offsets, or by laying their branches
in the ground, as of pinks and carnations. Other varieties may
be procured by collecting &s;eeds and &s;owing them in di&s;&s;imilar
&s;oils and &s;ituations; and &s;uch flowers as are of approved beauty,
may probably be occa&s;ionally &s;trengthened and enlarged by depri|ving
them in part of their offsets early in the &s;ea&s;on; or may be
broken into colours by keeping the roots &s;ome weeks or months
out of the ground in the autumn in dry or warm apartments.</P>
<P>The colours of flowers of this kind, I believe, are frequently
changed by &s;ituation; in my garden &s;ome roots of comfrey,
&s;ymphytum, with purple flowers had long exi&s;ted on a moi&s;ti&s;h
border; and la&s;t year other roots, I &s;uppo&s;e from the &s;eeds of
the former, grew in a dryer &s;ituation, and bore white flowers.
And Mr. Bradley a&s;&s;erts, in his Philo&s;. Account of Nature, p.
71, that &s;ome roots of purple hepatica, which were removed
from Tothill-fields to Henley on the Thames, became white;
and became purple again, when they were returned to their na|tive
&s;ituation.</P>

<PB N="496" REF="501">
<HEAD>IV. E&s;culent and Medicinal Flowers.</HEAD>
<P>1. The e&s;culent flowers mo&s;t in u&s;e at our tables have their
mucilage in &s;ome degree coagulated by boiling them in water or
in &s;team, and are con&s;umed before their maturity, as tho&s;e of
artichoke, cinara &s;colymus; of mercury, mercurialis; of &s;ea-cale,
crambe maritima; and of brocoli and cauliflower, bra&s;&s;ica
olearacea, italica and botrytis. The flowers of the na&s;turtion,
tropeolum majus, po&s;&s;e&s;s an agreeable acrimony, and are eaten
raw, &s;hred with the fre&s;h leaves of lettuce, young mu&s;tard
plants, or red cabbage. Other flowers are u&s;ed for dome&s;tic
or medicinal purpo&s;es, as tho&s;e of hops, humulus lupulus, ca|momile,
anthemis nobilis, ro&s;es, cardamine, violets.</P>
<P>The three foremo&s;t of the&s;e, the artichoke, and mercury,
and &s;ea-cale, are perennial plants; and, as they put forth nu|merous
root-&s;cions or offsets, may have their principal &s;tem much
invigorated, and will con&s;equently produce larger flowers, by
taking away many of the&s;e offsets, &s;o as to leave but two or
three on a root. And as the ripening of the &s;eed is no object,
a greater abundance of moi&s;ture, than the&s;e plants have been na|turally
accu&s;tomed to, with proportional increa&s;e of warmth in
re&s;pect to &s;ituation, will forward their growth, and increa&s;e
their &s;ize.</P>
<P>A great part of the nutritious mucilage in the artichoke is
placed in the upper part of the &s;tem, as well as in the pericar|pium
of the flower, which &s;hould therefore be boiled along with
it for the purpo&s;e of coagulation; and might then probably be
managed &s;o as to re&s;emble &s;agoe, if granulated by pa&s;&s;ing it
through &s;ieves.</P>
<P>The art of boiling vegetables of all kinds in &s;team in&s;tead of
in water, might probably be managed to advantage, as a greater
degree of heat might be thus given them, by contriving to in|crea&s;e
the heat of the &s;team after it has left the water; and
thus the vegetable mucilage in roots and &s;eeds, as in potatoes
and flour-puddings, as well as in their leaves, &s;tems, and flower-cups,
might be rendered probably more nutritive, and perhaps
more palatable.</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="502">
But many of the leaves of vegetables, as the &s;ummits of cab|bage-&s;prouts,
lo&s;e their green colour by being boiled in &s;team, and
look like blanched vegetables. This etiolation of &s;ome vegeta|bles
by &s;team is probably owing to its di&s;&s;olving their colouring
matter which may then become decompo&s;ed; and may render
them le&s;s agreeable to tho&s;e who choo&s;e by the eye rather than
by the palate; which green colour is however heightened by
boiling them in &s;ome hard waters which contain di&s;&s;olved lime
or &s;ea-&s;alt, or by a &s;light admixture of common &s;alt with &s;oft
water. An effect which is owing to the evaporation of a part of
the marine acid, and to the remaining alkali, which was the
ba&s;is of it, when applied to blui&s;h vegetables converting them
into green, as in the common experiment of adding &s;alt of tartar
to &s;yrup of violets; or, according to the cu&s;tom of &s;ome cooks,
who add a little pota&s;h, or fixed vegetable alkali, to the water,
in which young peas are boiled to make them green, and after|wards
a very little &s;ugar to &s;weeten them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame effect of making vegetables green, when boiled in
other kinds of hard waters, is probably produced by the lime,
which abounds in them; and which like the vegetable alkali
when the aerial acid, which was united with it evaporates, is
&s;aid to convert blui&s;h vegetable colours into green ones.</P>
<P>The nutritious mucilage re&s;ides likewi&s;e in the young &s;tems of
mercury, which &s;hould therefore be eaten before the flower be|gins
to open. The &s;talks and immature flowers of &s;ea-cale are
&s;imilar to good brocoli, if eaten young; though many garden|ers
prefer the blanching them, which &s;upplies an early and agree|able
repa&s;t, de&s;cribed in Sect, XIV. 3. 3. A&s;paragus does not
perhaps properly belong to this &s;ection, as the &s;tem is eaten, be|fore
the flower becomes vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>2. The cultivation of brocoli and cauliflower mu&s;t be very &s;i|milar,
except as to the &s;ea&s;ons of the year, as they are varieties
of the &s;ame &s;pecies of plant of the cabbage family. The fol|lowing
directions for the cultivation $word$ brocoli were &s;ent me by
Edward Tighe, E&s;q. an inge$$ous gentleman of Ireland, along
with an elegant Latin $word$ on the &s;ame &s;ubject, a free tran&s;la|tion
of which is placed at the end of this &s;ection.</P>
<P><PB N="498" REF="503">
&startq;Brocoli may be &s;o managed as to &s;upply the table with a de|licious
and &s;alutary vegetable during the months of November,
December, January, February, March, April, and May.</P>
<Q><P>1. Procure prime &s;eed from Rome or Naples both for early
and late &s;owing.</P>
<P>2. Sow at the ce&s;&s;ation of the vernal &s;nows, and repeat it
once a month till the end of May, or longer.</P>
<P>3. When three leaves appear, tran&s;plant them; and when &s;ix
leaves appear, tran&s;plant them again. Afterwards in
June, July, and Augu&s;t, tran&s;plant them two or three
feet a&s;under, to remain.</P>
<P>4. During September and October the ground mu&s;t be
loo&s;ened and repeatedly cleared from weeds and &s;tones;
and the plants earthed up to pre&s;erve their roots from the
fro&s;t, and to prevent their being injured by the equinoc|tial
winds.</P>
<P>5. Water them occa&s;ionally with water impregnated with
dung.</P>
<P>6. Sow and plant them far from hedges, trees, and walls.</P></Q>
<P>The head is generally completed in five or &s;ix days from its
fir&s;t appearance, and &s;hould not remain much longer; the &s;talk
&s;hould be boiled with the flower, and peeled in the kitchen, be|fore
it is brought to the table.&endq;</P>
<P>Some kinds of Italian brocoli are &s;aid to produce &s;ome knobs
or bulbs at their roots, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be for the pur|po&s;e
of rai&s;ing other &s;tems; if this la&s;t circum&s;tance be a&s;cer|tained,
they &s;hould be broken off, when the principal &s;tem is
tran&s;planted; like the new root of orchis to enlarge the flower,
mentioned in Section XV. 2. 4. But they may be &s;imply a re|&s;ervoir
of nutriment for the principal &s;tem, as in carrots and tur|nips;
in that ca&s;e they &s;hould certainly remain, and be tran&s;|planted
along with the &s;tem.</P>
<P>3. In re&s;pect $word$ the flowers of hop, humulus lupulus; and
chamomile, authemis $word$; as well as tho&s;e of ro&s;es, violets,
cardamine, and the na&s;turtio$ above mentioned; as their pe|tals
only are required, it would $word$ much to their quality, if
they could be cultivated in their double $word$ multiplied &s;tate, as is
generally indeed practi&s;ed in re&s;pect to ro&s;es and chamomile;
<PB N="499" REF="504">
many acres of the latter of which are cultivated near Che&s;ter|field
in Derby&s;hire, and are &s;old, I am informed, to mix with
hops. when tho&s;e crops are deficient, as well as for the pur|po&s;es
of medicine. What might be the effect of endeavouring
to introduce a duplicature or multiplication of the flowers of ar|tichoke,
&s;ea-cale, cauliflower, and brocoli, has not, I believe,
been experienced.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>V. Flowers u&s;ed in the Arts.</HEAD>
<P>1. The beautiful membrane, which covers the &s;eeds of euo|nymus
or &s;pindle-tree, and of the bixa of South America, is &s;aid
to be manufactured into the anotta, or arnotta, u&s;ed in colouring
chee&s;e; but I am told that madder, made from the root of rubia
tinctoria, is &s;old frequently in its &s;tead, and may be readily
grown by farmers in their own gardens. Few flowers are u&s;ed
in the art of dying, their colours are &s;o fugitive, as they readily
bleach when expo&s;ed to the light, and cannot be kept long even
in the herbariums of botani&s;ts without lo&s;ing their colours;
which is believed to be owing to the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere
being &s;eparated from the aerial water by the &s;un's light, and con|verted
into a gas combined only with heat or light, and in that
&s;tate more readily uniting with the colouring matter of flowers,
and producing a new acid, which is tran&s;parent, colourle&s;s, or
white, or is di&s;&s;olved and wa&s;hed away by the dews or rains.</P>
<P>The blue colour of the flowers of violets has been extracted
by water, and pre&s;erved by the addition of &s;ugar converting it
into &s;yrup for the purpo&s;es of medicine in part, but chiefly for
tho&s;e of chemi&s;try, to &s;hew the change of vegetable blues into
greens by an admixture of fixed alkali, as &s;alt of tartar or pota&s;h;
and into red by the admixture of an acid, as tho&s;e of &s;ulphur,
nitre or marine &s;alt.</P>
<P>2. Another very important flower, which is &s;uffered to grow
to maturity for the purpo&s;e of u&s;ing the fine fibres which wing or
invelope its &s;eeds, is that of the cotton plant, go&s;&s;ypium; which,
as it requires &s;o much le&s;s preparation than the fibres of the &s;tems
of flax and of hemp or nettles, is likely to become the principal
clothing of mankind; and e&s;pecially &s;ince the art of &s;pinning it
<PB N="500" REF="505">
was brought to &s;uch wonderful perfection by the genius of Sir
Richard Arkwright, who di&s;covered that two &s;ets of rollers
moving with different velocities would draw out the fibres of
cotton into a fine thread more accurately than could be done by
the human hand, as well as more expeditiou&s;ly, along with
much other very ingenious machinery.</P>
<P>There are two bog or water plants in our mora&s;&s;es, which
produce much vegetable fibres attached to their &s;eeds, one of
the&s;e is the typha, or cat's-tail; and the other eriophorum, or
cotton-ru&s;h. The fibres of the former are &s;hort and coar&s;e, but
might &s;erve perhaps to &s;tuff cu&s;hions, or even coar&s;e beds;
tho&s;e of the latter are longer, and perhaps fine enough to &s;pin.
And as both the&s;e only grow on bogs or in water, where we at
pre&s;ent cultivate no u&s;eful vegetables, one or both of them, might
po&s;&s;ibly be worthy the attention of tho&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s;s aquatic or
mar&s;hy &s;ituations. The cultivation of the cotton plant belongs
to warmer climates, and may probably require abundant water
for its vigorous growth, as well as the typha and eriophorum of
this country.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>VI. Nutritious parts of Vegetables.</HEAD>
<P>1. Having treated of the cultivation of fruits, &s;eeds, roots,
barks, leaves, woods, and flowers, an important que&s;tion pre|&s;ents
it&s;elf; which of them may &s;upply the mo&s;t nutrition to
mankind, or to other animals?</P>
<P>It may be an&s;wered fir&s;t, that tho&s;e vegetables, or parts of ve|getables,
which approach neare&s;t to the nature of animal bodies,
are mo&s;t likely to &s;upply them with the mo&s;t nutriment; as the
e&s;culent mu&s;hrooms, and he gluten of wheat, and the oils of
&s;eeds and kernels. The former cla&s;s of plants &s;eems to connect
the animal and vegetable kingdoms of nature, as &s;poken of in
Sect. XVII. 2. 5. and though many of them po&s;&s;e&s;s an acrid,
and &s;ome of them an intoxicating quality, it is probable that the
former might be de&s;troyed, and the latter dimini&s;hed, by the
heat employed in cookery. This &s;hould neverthele&s;s be at|tempted
with due caution; &s;ince, though one kind of vegetable
acrimony, as that of water-cre&s;&s;es and of cabbages is much di|mini&s;hed
<PB N="501" REF="506">
or de&s;troyed by a boiling heat, yet that of the leaves of
arum maculatum, and of arum ari&s;arum, I found by experiment
was not decrea&s;ed by boiling. And a few grains of the powder
of lycoperdon, puff-ball, have lately been recommended in epi|leptic
fits, and may thence po&s;&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;s a powerful narcotic
quality. The gluten of wheat is &s;uppo&s;ed to approach towards
the coagulable lymph of animal bodies, as referred to in Sect.
XVI. 7. 1. and was once, I believe, adverti&s;ed as an alimentary
powder, and recommended as a nouri&s;hment of the mo&s;t porta|ble
kind for the &s;u&s;tenance of marching armies. And la&s;tly the
oils of vegetables approach much to a &s;imilitude with tho&s;e of
animal bodies.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, it may be an&s;wered, that &s;ince the chyle of all
red blooded animals is believed to be nearly &s;imilar, and to con&s;i&s;t
principally of &s;ugar, mucilage, and oil; the la&s;t of which ingre|dients
renders it white by its in&s;olubility in water, and thence
di&s;tingui&s;hes it from the vegetable chyle or &s;ap-juice of trees,
which is tran&s;parent, and is believed to con&s;i&s;t principally of &s;ugar
and mucilage without oil; tho&s;e parts of vegetables which con|tain
the greate&s;t quantity of the&s;e ingredients which compo&s;e ani|mal
chyle, or are convertible into them by the power of dige&s;tion,
may be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the mo&s;t nutriment for red-blooded
animals.</P>
<P>To this may be added, that the nutritive quality of &s;ugar is
inconte&s;tably evinced from the known fact, that the &s;laves in
the &s;ugar i&s;lands become in better condition during the &s;ugar &s;ea|&s;on,
though they are compelled to labour harder. The nutria|tive
quality of &s;imple mucilage was &s;hewn in a remarkable in|&s;tance
on record; where a caravan by &s;ome misfortune had con|&s;umed
or lo&s;t all their other provi&s;ions, and lived many weeks on
the gum arabic alone, which con&s;tituted their principal merchan|di&s;e.
The nutritive quality of oil is ob&s;ervable in the proce&s;s of
feeding cattle with oil-cake, and in the habits of the natives
of the northern latitudes, who u&s;e the oil of fi&s;h for both meat
and drink, and derive from it their principal nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Sugar is known to be the &s;ame, from whatever vegetable it is
extracted, whether from the fruit of the vine or apple-tree, from
the joints of the &s;ugar-cane, from the &s;ap-ve&s;&s;els of the maple,
<PB N="502" REF="507">
from the alburnum of the manna a&s;h, from the &s;eeds of germi|nated
barley and rice, from the roots of beets, carrots, and pota|toes,
or, la&s;tly, from the nectaries of flowers. The expre&s;&s;ed
oils of vegetables are al&s;o believed not much to differ from each
other in re&s;pect to the nutriment they contain, though &s;ome of
them may approach nearer to the nature of animal fat; as the
painters di&s;tingui&s;h them by their greater aptitude to dry, when
mixed with their colours and expo&s;ed to the air. But the word
mucilage has been u&s;ed for &s;tarch, which will not di&s;&s;olve in cold
water, as well as for gum arabic, and other mucilages properly
&s;o called, which will di&s;&s;olve in cold water, and even for the
gluten of wheat, which will not di&s;&s;olve in either hot or cold
water. We may therefore conclude, that tho&s;e parts of vege|tables,
which contain the mo&s;t of the&s;e materials, are the mo&s;t
nutritive, if they do not contain along with them &s;ome noxious
materials united with their &s;alutary ones, and which cannot be
readily &s;eparated from them.</P>
<P>3. Though the parts of vegetables, which po&s;&s;e&s;s much oil,
&s;ugar, or mucilage, may afford more expeditious nutrition, as
they con&s;titute the ingredients of the chyle of all red-blooded
animals; yet there are other materials, which appear to be &s;o
readily convertible into &s;ugar or into mucilage, as perhaps nearly
to &s;upply an equal quantity of nutriment. Thus by the proce&s;s
of germination, as when &s;eeds of barley are converted into malt,
and when roots pullulate in our &s;tore-rooms, as of onions or po|tatoes;
the farina, con&s;i&s;ting of meal or &s;tarch, is in part con|verted
into &s;ugar, and in part into mucilage; &s;imilar to this
proce&s;s of germination appears to be that of ripening, by which
the au&s;tere juices of fruits are tran&s;muted into &s;weet ones; and
al&s;o the culinary proce&s;&s;es of baking or boiling, by which the
au&s;tere juices of unripe pears are changed into &s;weet ones by the
application of heat, as mentioned in Sect. VI. 5. But another
more expeditious conver&s;ion of vegetable materials into &s;ugar is
by the dige&s;tion of animals, which may be truly termed a &s;accha|rine
proce&s;s; as appears in tho&s;e, who labour under diabates,
as by evaporating the urine of one of the&s;e patients, &s;ixteen
ounces of impure &s;ugar were daily extracted for &s;ome time.

Hence, though the oily kernels of nuts, walnuts, almonds,
and the oily &s;eeds, of flax, hemp, rape, may contain mo&s;t expe|ditious
nutriment; and next to the&s;e the &s;accharine fruits of
figs, dates, rai&s;ins, and the &s;weet roots of beet, mungel-wor&s;al,
ground artichoke, helianthus tubero&s;us, par&s;nip, carrot, may
contain expeditious nutriment. Yet the more farinaceous &s;eeds,
as of wheat, peas, rice, barley, oats, and buck-wheat, polygo|num
fagopyrum, and the roots of potatoes, which contain
&s;tarch, and flour, and mucilage, which are convertible into
&s;ugar in the &s;tomachs of animals, and are probably by that di|ge&s;tive
proce&s;s, and their previous ma&s;tication in the mouth,
mingled with more animal coagulable lymph, as the &s;aliva, ga&s;|tric,
and pancreatic juices, and may thus &s;upply a more anima|lized
nutriment than the former; and may on that account con|tribute
more to &s;trengthen the &s;y&s;tem. Of the&s;e &s;eeds and roots
it appears probable, that tho&s;e, which contain the mo&s;t &s;tarch or
gluten, as wheat, afford the mo&s;t nouri&s;hment, as they are be|lieved
to make the be&s;t bread.</P>
<P>4. The alburnum, or &s;ap-wood, of mo&s;t trees in the winter
months probably contain much nutritious matter; whence it is
&s;o &s;oon de&s;troyed by fermentation or putrefaction when deprived
of life; and by in&s;ects, when it is deprived of its protecting
bark. This nutritious matter might be obtained by grating, or
ra&s;ping, or pounding it, and boiling the powder or &s;aw-du&s;t thus
procured. The bark of all tho&s;e vegetables, which are armed
with thorns or prickles, is believed to contain much nutritious
matter, which their armour was de&s;igned to protect; as the
inner barks of elm, holly, goo&s;eberry, whin or gor&s;e, contain
much nutritive mucilage; thus the deer in Needwood Fore&s;t
greedily peel the bark from the branches of holly, which are
cut from the &s;ummits of tho&s;e trees, where they have no prickles,
as mentioned in Botanic Garden, Vol. II. note on Ilex. And
hor&s;es are &s;aid to be well nouri&s;hed by gor&s;e, if the prickles
are previou&s;ly de&s;troyed by rolling a &s;tone over it, as the tanners
brui&s;e their oak-bark; and &s;ome hor&s;es are &s;aid to be &s;o fond of
it, and &s;o wi&s;e, as to brui&s;e young gor&s;e-bu&s;hes with their feet,
and then to eat them.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="509">
Fern roots are &s;aid to be eaten by the natives of New Hol|land,
and in other countries in times of &s;carcity; but as their
farinaceous or mucilaginous matter is included in ligneous fibres
too hard for ma&s;tication, the method of cooking it is &s;aid to
con&s;i&s;t in boiling the root, and then extracting the fibres by
hammering it to pieces. The root of white bryony, which
grows to a great &s;ize in our hedge-bottoms, is &s;aid, by M. Per|mentier,
to po&s;&s;e&s;s a quantity of &s;tarch, which was capable of
being warned from the acrid mucilage by grating it into cold
water, and of being manufactured into an agreeable and &s;alutary
bread; like the bread made from the ca&s;&s;ava, which is &s;aid to
undergo a &s;mall proce&s;s, by expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome of the acrimonious
mucilage previous to the application of the heat of cookery.
Which however not only de&s;troys the acrimony of many vege|tables,
as of water-cre&s;&s;es, cabbages, and the &s;kins of potatoes,
but is al&s;o believed to render &s;ome of them more nutritive by
coagulating their mucilage, which was previou&s;ly combined with
too great a proportion of water.</P>
<P>5. It would appear therefore in general, that the &s;eeds or
kernels of vegetables afford the mo&s;t nutriment; next to the&s;e
their fruits and roots; and afterwards the alburnum or bark.
Some of the flowers al&s;o in their early &s;tate before impregnation,
as tho&s;e of artichoke, cinara, and cauliflower, bra&s;&s;ica, are nu|tritious
from the mucilage, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and &s;ome &s;eeds
already impregnated, but &s;till in their immature &s;tate, along
with their hu&s;ks or cap&s;ules, as tho&s;e of kidney-beans, pha&s;eolus,
and of very young peas, afford a &s;alutary nutriment. And
la&s;tly all flowers after the expan&s;ion of their corols &s;ecrete
honey; which &s;upplies food to innumerable in&s;ects, who plunder
it, as well as to mankind. In the ba&s;es of many leaves another
&s;accharine or mucilaginous juice is &s;ecreted, as at the joints of
gra&s;s, on the bulbs of onions, and at the lower parts of the
leaves of cabbages, and around the &s;tems of a&s;paragus, mercury,
and hop-buds, during the early &s;tate of their flowers; but the
leaves them&s;elves, like the lungs of animals, &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s
nutritious aliment than many other parts of their &s;y&s;tem.</P>

<HEAD>VII. The Happine&s;s of Organic Life.</HEAD>
<P>All organized nature may be divided into &s;tationary organi|zations,
and locomotive organizations; the former of which
are called vegetables, and the latter animals. All tho&s;e parts
of vegetables, which are mo&s;t nutritious to animals, con&s;i&s;t, as
ob&s;erved above, of aliment &s;ecreted from the vegetable blood,
and laid up in re&s;ervoirs for the future &s;u&s;tenance of their em|bryon
or infant progeny; which re&s;ervoirs are plundered by
locomotive animals, and devoured along with the progeny, they
were de&s;igned to &s;upport! add to this, that the &s;tronger loco|motive
animals devour the weaker ones without mercy. Such
is the condition of organic nature! who&s;e fir&s;t law might be
expre&s;&s;ed in the words, &startq;Eat or be Eaten!&endq; and which would
&s;eem to be one great &s;laughter-hou&s;e, one univer&s;al &s;cene of ra|pacity
and inju&s;tice!</P>
<P>1. Where &s;hall we find a benevolent idea to con&s;ole us amid
&s;o much apparent mi&s;ery?&mdash;I hope the &s;ympathizing reader will
not think the following account of the happine&s;s, which orga|nized
beings acquire from irritation only, impertinently in&s;erted
in this place; their happine&s;s derived from imagination and vo|lition
may be treated of in &s;ome future work.</P>
<P>It may fir&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the &s;eeds of plants and the eggs
of animals, when they have left the pericarp or uterus, and have
not yet commenced their new growth upon the &s;oil, or beneath
the wings of the mother, exi&s;t in a torpid &s;tate, not po&s;&s;e&s;ed
of &s;en&s;itive life; and cannot therefore at this time be &s;uppo&s;ed
to &s;uffer pain, when they are de&s;troyed by other animals; though
tho&s;e animals obtain plea&s;ure from the activity, into which their
va&s;cular &s;y&s;tems are excited by the &s;timulus of the aliment thus
&s;upplied.</P>
<P>Secondly, that the young of lacte&s;cent animals both acquire
and communicate plea&s;ure to the enamoured mother, from whom
they receive their nutriment, as mentioned in Botanic Garden,
Vol. I. Canto I. l. 278. note; which con&s;titutes the mo&s;t
beautiful and mo&s;t benevolent part of the great &s;y&s;tem of na|ture.</P>
<P><PB N="506" REF="511">
Thirdly, all animals, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, vegetables, receive
plea&s;ure in the reproduction of their &s;pecies; and where &s;eeds are
di&s;per&s;ed on the &s;oil, and the eggs of &s;ome animals and of many
in&s;ects are buried beneath it, to be revived and hatched by the
warmth of the &s;un; there can be no pain in the&s;e ca&s;es inflicted
on the mother, when they are de&s;troyed by animals or by in|&s;ects,
as &s;he is uncon&s;cious of their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Fourthly, as all animal exi&s;tence mu&s;t peri&s;h in proce&s;s of
time, by the inirritability and con&s;equent debility occa&s;ioned by
the repetition of &s;timulus, which is termed habit, and appears
to be an univer&s;al law of nature: it is &s;o ordered, that as &s;oon
as any organized being becomes le&s;s irritable and le&s;s &s;en&s;ible,
and in con&s;equence feeble or &s;ickly, that it is de&s;troyed and eaten
by other more irritable and more &s;en&s;ible, and in con&s;equence
more vigorous organized beings; as in&s;ects attack the weaker
vegetable productions in preference to the healthy ones; and
bea&s;ts of prey more ea&s;ily catch and conquer the aged and in|firm,
and the young ones are defended by their parents. By
this contrivance more plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation exi&s;ts in the world,
as the organized matter is taken from a &s;tate of le&s;s irritability
and le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility, and converted into a &s;tate of greater; that
is, in other words, that the old organizations, whether &s;tation|ary
or locomotive ones, are tran&s;migrated into young ones:
whence it happened, that before mankind introduced rational
&s;ociety, and conquered the &s;avage world, old age was unknown
on earth!</P>
<P>Finally, the aged and infirm, from their pre&s;ent &s;tate of inirri|tability
and in&s;en&s;ibility, lo&s;e their lives with le&s;s pain, and
which cea&s;es in&s;tantly with the &s;troke of death; in&s;omuch that
death cannot &s;o properly be called po&s;itive evil, as the termina|tion
of good.</P>
<P>To this &s;hould be added, that a long continued or a great ex|ce&s;s
of pain cannot afflict an organized being; as &s;yncope or &s;ud|den
death, and con&s;equent decompo&s;ition, attends very violent
pains; and a lingering death attends the continuation of le&s;s vio|lent
ones, Hence it becomes a con&s;oling circum&s;tance, that mi|&s;ery
is not immortal.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="512">
A philo&s;opher, whom I left in my library, has peru&s;ed the
above paragraphs, and added the &s;ub&s;equent one to my manu|&s;cript.
&startq;It con&s;oles me to find, as I contemplate with you the
whole of organized nature, that it is not in the power of any
one per&s;onage, whether &s;tate&s;man or hero, to produce by his ill-employed
activity &s;o much mi&s;ery, as might have been &s;uppo&s;ed.
Thus, if a Ru&s;&s;ian army, in the&s;e in&s;ane times, after having en|dured
a laborious march of many hundred miles, is de&s;troyed by
a French army in defence of their republic, what has happened?
Forty thou&s;and human creatures dragged from their homes and
their connexions cea&s;e to exi&s;t, and have manured the earth; but
the quantity of organized matter of which they were compo&s;ed,
pre&s;ently revives in the forms of millions of micro&s;copic animals,
vegetables and in&s;ects, and afterwards of quadrupeds and men;
the &s;um of who&s;e happine&s;s is perhaps much greater than that of
the hara&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers, by who&s;e de&s;truction they have gained
their existence!&mdash;Is not this a con&s;oling idea to a mind of uni|ver&s;al
&s;ympathy?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I well remember to have heard an ingenious agricultor boa&s;t,
that he had drained two hundred acres of mora&s;&s;y land, on
which he now was able to feed an hundred oxen; and added,&endq; &startq;is not that a meritorious thing?&endq; &startq;True,&endq; replied one of the
company, &startq;but you forget, that you hare de&s;troyed a thou&s;and
free republics of ants, and ten thou&s;and rational frogs, be&s;ides
innumerable aquatic in&s;ects and aquatic vegetables.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Having written the above, I fear you may think me a mi&s;|anthrope,

Homo &s;um, humani nihil a me alienum puto.&endq;</P>
<P>2. The va&s;cular &s;y&s;tems of animal bodies are excited into
action by the &s;timulus of the fluids, which they ab&s;orb, circu|late,
and &s;ecrete; and when this action is exerted in its natural
or mo&s;t u&s;ual quantity, it is attended with agreeable &s;en&s;ation,
which con&s;titutes the plea&s;ure of organized exi&s;tence. The&s;e
va&s;cular actions of animals, which perform dige&s;tion, &s;anguifi|cation,
and &s;ecretion, convert the aliment, after its &s;olution in
the &s;tomach, into more compounded and more &s;olid materials;
as into mu&s;cles, membranes, nerves, bones, and &s;hells; at the
<PB N="508" REF="513">
&s;ame time that plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation attends this activity of the
&s;y&s;tem. The va&s;cular actions of vegetables, which perform
their dige&s;tion, &s;anguification, and &s;ecretion, convert the ele|ments
of air and water, or other aliments, which they receive
from organized matter decompo&s;ing beneath the &s;oil, into more
compounded or more &s;olid materials, as into vegetable ve&s;&s;els,
mu&s;cles, membranes, nerves, and ligneous fibres; and a degree
of plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed from the &s;tronge&s;t ana|logy
to attend this activity of their &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>3. Many of the materials, which have been thus produced
by the dige&s;tion and &s;ecretion of organized beings, and have
given plea&s;ure in their production, have been &s;low in their de|compo&s;ition
after the death of the creature; as the &s;hells of fi&s;h
were originally thus formed, and were left at the bottom of the
ocean, till they became wonderfully accumulated, were after|wards
elevated by &s;ubmarine fires, and con&s;titute at this day the
immen&s;e rocks and unmea&s;ured &s;trata of lime&s;tone, chalk, and
marble. As mentioned in Sect. X. 10. 1.</P>
<P>The &s;trata, which are incumbent on the calcareous ones,
which con&s;i&s;t of coals, &s;and, iron, clay and marl, are all of
them believed to have been originally the products chiefly of ve|getable
organization; whatever changes they have &s;ince under|gone
in the long progre&s;s of their decompo&s;ition, and that all
tho&s;e &s;olid parts of the earth have been thus fabricated from their
&s;impler elements by vegetable and by animal life, and have given
plea&s;ure to tho&s;e organized beings, which formed them, at the
time of their production.</P>
<P>We hence acquire this &s;ublime and intere&s;ting idea; that all
the calcareous mountains in the world, and all the &s;trata of clay,
coal, marl, &s;and, and iron, which are incumbent on them, are

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLAN FOR DISPOSING PART OF THE VEGETABLE SYSTEM OF LINNEUS INTO MORE NATURAL CLASSES AND ORDERS.</HEAD>
<Q>I. The cla&s;&s;es of plants di&s;tingui&s;hed by the proportion or &s;ituation of
the &s;tamina are more natural than tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed by their num|bers.
Many Linnean cla&s;&s;es thus di&s;tingui&s;hed. Many of the
orders are natural cla&s;&s;ifications. U&s;e of natural cla&s;&s;es. 2.
The &s;ituation and proportion of the &s;exual organs are le&s;s liable
to variation than their numbers. Great variation in re&s;pect to
number of the &s;tamina. From luxuriant growth. Some &s;pecies
have but half the number. Others have part of them without
anthers. The number of pi&s;tilla varies in different &s;pecies of the
&s;ame genus. Progre&s;s of nature to greater perfection. Of the cla&s;s
Syngene&s;ia. 3. Immutable parts di&s;covered by rea&s;oning as well
as by ob&s;ervation. Filaments of Meadia unchangeable, and of he|merocalis
fulva, nigella, collin&s;onia, &s;partium. 4. Some natural
orders might become cla&s;&s;es. As the gra&s;&s;es, and the umbellatae,
and &s;tellatae. Forms of the filaments, and of the anthers, as
well as their &s;ituations, le&s;s variable than their numbers. 5. Cla&s;|&s;ic
characters. From &s;hort and long filaments. From their
unequal heights. From their different in&s;ertions. From their
re&s;pective &s;ituations. From their adhe&s;ions to each other. Or
to the corol, or &s;tyle. From their exi&s;tence in different flowers.
From the connexion of the anthers, or from the forms of the fila|ments
and anthers. 6 Uncertainty of the number of pi&s;tilla.
Their proportions and figures le&s;s variable. And would define
more natural orders. 7. Characters of orders from the length
of the &s;tyle. The curvature of it. The attitudes of it. Divi|&s;ions
of the &s;tigma. Ab&s;ence of the &s;tigma. Adhe&s;ions of the
&s;tyle. 8. Conclu&s;ion.</Q>
<P>I. OFTEN as I have admired the cla&s;&s;ification of vegetables
by the great Linneus deduced from their &s;exual organs of repro|duction,
<PB N="513" REF="518">
&s;ome of the cla&s;&s;es have appeared to me to be more ex|cellent
than others, as they &s;eemed to approach nearer to na|tural
ones. On further attention to this &s;ubject, I perceived
that tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es which were deduced from the proportions or
&s;ituations of the &s;tamina, or which included the number of the
&s;tamina along with their proportions and &s;ituations, were more
natural cla&s;&s;es than tho&s;e, which were di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;imply by the
number of them.</P>
<P>Thus the cla&s;&s;es termed Dydynamia and Tetradynamia, which
are derived from the proportions and &s;ituations of the &s;tamina
as well as their number, are wonderfully natural; to which may
be added the cla&s;&s;es Ico&s;andria, and Polyandria, as their diag|no&s;tic
character con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ituation of the &s;tamina on the
calyx or petals in the former cla&s;s, and on the recaptacle in the
latter, though the names of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es are not &s;o happy, as
they &s;imply refer to their numbers, which are unfortunately very
variable.</P>
<P>Some other of the Linnean cla&s;&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;itu|ation
of the filaments, as the Monadelphia, Diadelphia, Polyadel|phia,
and Gynandria; all which approach towards natural cla&s;&s;es;
and the Syngene&s;ia, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the adhe&s;ion of
the anthers, is a cla&s;s beautifully natural, except the la&s;t order.</P>
<P>Many of the orders al&s;o in the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem are natural cla&s;&s;i|fications,
as the gra&s;&s;es in the cla&s;s Triandria, the umbellated
plants in the cla&s;s Pentandria, and perhaps the cruciform plants
in the cla&s;s Tetandria; with many among&s;t tho&s;e which are
termed natural orders at the end of the Genera Plantarum; all
which might probably be di&s;criminated by &s;ome &s;ituation, or pro|portion,
or form, of their re&s;pective &s;tamina.</P>
<P>As the cla&s;&s;es deduced from the proportions or &s;ituations of the
&s;tamina alone, or conjointly with their re&s;pective number, appear
thus to produce more natural di&s;tributions of vegetables, than
tho&s;e derived &s;imply from their number; it might have been more
fortunate for the &s;cience of botany, if the great author of the
&s;exual &s;y&s;tem had turned his mind to have cla&s;&s;ed all of them
from the proportions, &s;ituations, and forms of the &s;tamina alone,
or from the&s;e conjointly with their number, and to have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the orders according to the proportions, &s;ituations, or
forms of the pi&s;tilla alone, or conjointly with their numbers.</P>
<P><PB N="514" REF="519">
The great u&s;e of di&s;tributing plants into natural cla&s;&s;es is not
only for the purpo&s;e of more readily di&s;tingui&s;hing them from
each other, and di&s;covering their names, but al&s;o for that of
more readily detecting the virtues or u&s;es of them in diet, medi|cine,
or the arts; as for the purpo&s;es of dying, tanning, archi|tecture,
&s;hip-building; which has already been happily expe|rienced
in attending to the genera or families of plants, which
are all natural di&s;tributions of them, whence the &s;ame virtues or
qualities generally exi&s;t among all the &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus,
though perhaps in different degrees.</P>
<P>2. But another great advantage would probably occur from
deducing the characters of the cla&s;&s;es of vegetables from the &s;itua|tions,
proportions, or forms of the &s;exual organs rather than
from their number; which is, that the&s;e criterions of the cla&s;&s;es
and orders would be much le&s;s &s;ubject to variation.</P>
<P>The variation of the Dumber of &s;tamina not only frequently
occurs from the too luxuriant growth of many cultivated flowers,
or by the duplicature or multiplication of their petals, or necta|ries,
which is liable much to inconvenience the young botani&s;t;
but &s;everal of the &s;pecies of plants have but half the number of
&s;tamina which other &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus po&s;&s;e&s;s. This
occurs &s;o frequently, that the defect of number is expre&s;&s;ed as an
e&s;&s;ential character of the &s;pecies in many in&s;tances. Thus the
cera&s;tium pentandrum, and &s;pergula pentranda, di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e
&s;pecies from the other plants of the genus, which po&s;&s;e&s;s ten &s;ta|mens;
&s;o tamarix floribus pentandris, tamarix floribus decandris,
falix floribus diandris, falix triandra, &s;alix pentandra, valeriana
floribus monandris, valeriana floribus diandris, verbena diandra.</P>
<P>So the vernal flowers of the corchorus &s;iliquo&s;us have but four
&s;tamina, but the autumnal ones have numerous &s;tamina. The
linum flax of this country has but five perfect &s;tamina, and five
without anthers on their &s;ummits; whereas the linum lu&s;itanicum,
Portugal flax, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ten complete ones. The verbena, ver|vain,
of our country has four &s;tamina, that of Sweden but two;
the genus albuca, bignonia catalpa, gratiola, and hemlock-leaved
geranium, have only half their filaments crowned with anthers;
all-which and many others evince the uncertainty of depending
on numbers alone for di&s;tingui&s;hing the cla&s;&s;es of plants.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="520">
Nor are the number of pi&s;tilla more certain as a criterion of
the orders. Thus there is nigella pentagyna, and nigella deca|gyna;
hypericum floribus pentagynis, trigynis, and digynis,
with innumerable other &s;imilar in&s;tances, as mentioned in No. 6
of this Section. Which evince, that great confu&s;ion mu&s;t be
occa&s;ioned by a reliance &s;imply on the number of the pi&s;tilla for
defining the orders of plants.</P>
<P>I contend, that the number of the &s;exual organs in flowers is
more liable to change by the influence of &s;oil or climate, or by
the progre&s;s of time, than their &s;ituations or proportions, or
forms, and might therefore probably be more advantageou&s;ly em|ployed
in di&s;tingui&s;hing their cla&s;&s;es and orders from each other,
as well as in rendering them more natural combinations.</P>
<P>This mutability or uncertainty of the number of the organs of
reproduction belonging to individual flowers, would &s;eem to
ari&s;e from an attempt of all organized beings towards greater per|fection.
Whence as the &s;ucce&s;s of the proce&s;s of reproduction
becomes more certain from the greater perfection of the vegetable
being, the organs for the purpo&s;e of reproduction &s;een to be|come
fewer. Whence &s;ome flowers have lo&s;t half the &s;tamina,
and in others the anthers of tho&s;e &s;tamina are yet only deficient,
and in others the pi&s;tilla are deficient, all which in proce&s;s of
time may gradually become le&s;s numerous, or &s;eparate them&s;elves
from hermaphrodite flowers into &s;exual ones, as in the cla&s;&s;es of
monoecia and dioecia; and all of them finally, after a long pro|ce&s;s
of ages, become of the orders monandria and monogy|nia
of tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es; whil&s;t new kinds of vegetables may begin
a &s;imilar progre&s;s from le&s;s to greater perfection. So in animals,
the le&s;s perfect &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s organs for a more numerous repro|duction,
as fi&s;h and in&s;ects. Such would &s;eem to be the perpe|tual
progre&s;s of all organized being from le&s;s to greater perfection
exi&s;ting from the beginning of time to the end of it! a power
impre&s;&s;ed on nature by the great father of all.</P>
<P>Thus in the cla&s;s &s;yngene&s;ia, the tendency of the&s;e vegetables
from more numerous to a more &s;imple organization for the purpo&s;e
of reproduction is wonderfully con&s;picuous. In the order polygamia
aequalis, all the florets are furni&s;hed with male and female organs.
In the order polygamia &s;uperflua, the florets in the centre have both
male and female organs, tho&s;e in the circumference have only female
<PB N="516" REF="521">
ones; and of tho&s;e &s;ome have lo&s;t the corol of the floret. In
the order polygamia fru&s;tranea the florets in the centre po&s;&s;e&s;e
both male and female organs, but tho&s;e in the circumference
have neither; though at the &s;ame time the corols of tho&s;e florets
remain. And la&s;tly, in the order polygamia nece&s;&s;aria the central
florets are &s;imply male-florets, and tho&s;e in the circumference
&s;imply female ones; and thus approach to the cla&s;s of monoecia,
having the male and female organs in &s;eparate florets; and may
in proce&s;s of time exi&s;t in &s;eparate flowers, and afterwards in &s;e|parate
plants, like the two &s;exes of the more perfect animals.
Something &s;imilar to this &s;eems already to have occurred in the
plant phytolacca, of the cla&s;s decandria decagynia; which po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
one &s;pecies with twenty males, another with ten, another
with only eight males and eight females, and la&s;tly one of the
cla&s;s dioecia, or two hou&s;es.</P>
<P>3. In many flowers &s;ome circum&s;tances of the &s;ituations or
proportions or forms of the filaments or anthers may be &s;hewn,
by <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> as well as by ob&s;ervation, to be le&s;s mutable than
others; as the &s;hortne&s;s of the filaments of dodecatheon meadia,
cyclamen, &s;olanum, borago, fu&s;chia, and others. As mentioned
in Botanic Garden, Vol. II. note on Meadia. Thus in the
flower of meadia, the filaments are exceedingly &s;hort compared
to the &s;tyle and &s;eem to have been in that circum&s;tance immuta|ble.
Whence it became nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t to furni&s;h them with
long anthers, which &s;tand pointed towards the di&s;tant &s;tigma ap|parently
endeavouring to reach it. Secondly, it was nece&s;&s;ary
to bend the flower-&s;talks, when the corols open into tho&s;e grace|ful
curves, which con&s;titute the uncommon beauty both of this
flower and of the fu&s;chia; that the &s;tigma by hanging down im|mediately
beneath the anthers might thus receive, as it falls,
the prolific farina. And that this was the evident de&s;ign of the
curvature of the flower-&s;talk, appears from its ri&s;ing again, and
becoming quite erect, as &s;oon as the impregnation of the peri|carp
is accomplished. Thirdly, as the flower thus becomes per|pendicularly
pendent, it was nece&s;&s;ary to reflect, the petals for
the purpo&s;e of admitting light and air to the &s;exual organs.</P>
<P>We may rea&s;on from this &s;trucrure of the meadia, that all this
apparatus of long erect anthers? to approach the &s;tigma; of bend|ing
<PB N="517" REF="522">
the flower-&s;talk, that the &s;exual organs might become pendu|lous;
and then of reflecting the petals to give light and air;
might have all been &s;pared, if the filaments alone could have
grown as long as the &s;tyle; as occurs in mo&s;t other flowers.
And that therefore in the&s;e flowers the filaments are the mo&s;t
unchangeable parts of them; and that hence the comparative
length of the filaments in re&s;pect to the &s;tyle would afford the
mo&s;t immutable mark of their e&s;&s;ential character, or for the pur|po&s;e
of cla&s;&s;ification.</P>
<P>Another apparent in&s;tance of the great unchangeablene&s;s of
the length of the filaments exi&s;ts in the hemerocallis fulva,
tawny daylily, in which I ob&s;erve the &s;tyle is crooked, or bent
into a zigzag, about the middle of it, evidently for the purpo&s;e
of &s;hortening it, that the anthers might approach the &s;tigma;
the &s;talk of the flower not being &s;o flexible as to allow it to be|come
pendent, as in the hemerocallis flava, or yellow day-lily.</P>
<P>In nigella, devil in the bu&s;h, the &s;tyles are very long compared
with the filaments, and bending down their &s;tigmas over the an|thers
in curves, give the flower a re&s;emblance to a regal crown;
which need not to have occurred, if the filaments could more
ea&s;ily have been lengthened.</P>
<P>In collin&s;onia the two anthers &s;tand widely diverging on &s;hort
filaments, and the tall capillary &s;tyle bends its &s;tigma into con|tact
fir&s;t with one of them, and afterwards with the other. In
the &s;partium &s;coparium, common broom, the long &s;tyle bends
round into a circle to accommodate the &s;tigma to the &s;hort &s;et of
anthers, which great curvature need not have exi&s;ted, if the
filaments could more ea&s;ily have grown longer. Other in&s;tan|ces
of &s;imilar &s;tructure are related in Sect. VII. 2. 2 of this
work.</P>
<P>It is probable, that &s;imilar ob&s;ervations, and a con&s;equent
rea&s;oning on them, might be applied to many other kinds of
flowers &s;o as to detect the mo&s;t unchangeable parts of them:
but great time, labour, opportunity, and ingenuity, would be
required to e&s;tabli&s;h from them the mo&s;t invariable and mo&s;t na|tural
cla&s;&s;es of vegetation.</P>
<P><PB N="518" REF="523">
4. Many different proportions and &s;ituations and forms of the
filaments are enumerated in the Philo&s;ophia Botanica of Lin|naeus;
&s;ome of which might po&s;&s;ibly have become cla&s;&s;ical cha|racters,
if he had turned his attention to them, and given them
adapted names; as he has done to tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es, which he has
derived from the &s;ituations of the &s;exual organs, as didynamia,
tetradynamir, &s;yngene&s;ia, and others, which approach nearer to
natural cla&s;&s;es, and are &s;ubject to le&s;s variation than the numerical
ones.</P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e collections of plants, which Linnaeus has
termed natural orders, and &s;ome of tho&s;e of Ray, and Tourne|fort,
might perhaps have had names affixed to them, denoting
the &s;ituations or proportions or forms of their &s;tamina, and have
thus con&s;tituted natural cla&s;&s;es in the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem. Thus for
example the natural order of gra&s;&s;es might perhaps have had a
name denoting their long capillary filaments. The natural order
of gra&s;&s;es is &s;o con&s;picuous, as to have &s;truck all beholders; they
con&s;titute, it is &s;aid, nearly a &s;ixth part of the vegetable king|dom,
e&s;pecially in open countries; the leaves are not ea&s;ily
broken by being trampled on, but die in winter, becoming yellow
and dry; but what is wonderful, they are &s;aid to revive in the
&s;pring, and become green again. This natural order of plants
has been divided into cerealia and gramina, corn and gra&s;&s;es;
which however only differ in re&s;pect to the &s;ize of the &s;eeds. It is
much di&s;united by the numerical di&s;tinctions of the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem,
as &s;ome gra&s;&s;es belong to the ca&s;s monandria, diandria, triandria,
and hexandria; and tho&s;e of the triandria, and hexandria, are
either hermaphrodite, or monoecious, or polygamous plants. Of
the&s;e a very curious and exten&s;ive table is given in the Praelecti|ones
in Ordin. Natur. a Gi&s;eke Hamburg. 1792, p. 138.</P>
<P>A great part of the natural order of caryophyllei, in which
the number of the &s;tamina is very variable, are ob&s;erved by Mr.
Milne to have their filaments alternately attached to the claws of
the petals and to the receptacle, and might po&s;&s;ibly have a cla&s;&s;i|cal
denomination from that circum&s;tance. Botan. Dic. Art.
Caryophyllei.</P>
<P>The five &s;tamina of the umbellated plants in the cla&s;s of pen|tandria
digynia, with five petals, two &s;eeds, above; which are
<PB N="519" REF="524">
termed umbellateae in the natural orders of Linnaeus; as they
diverge from each other, might perhaps be called five &s;tarred, or
cinque-pointed &s;tamina from this &s;ituation. And in part the
natural order of plants termed &s;tellatae by Linneus, as $galium,
and a&s;perula; which belong to the cla&s;s tetandria monogynia
with one petal, two berries, above; the four diverging &s;tamina
might perhaps be termed cruciform, as they oppo&s;e each other.
And thus the&s;e natural collections of vegetables might acquire a
cla&s;&s;ical denomination from the &s;ituations of their &s;tamina, or
perhaps from the form of their filaments or anthers.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;ituations and proportions of the &s;tamina, with many
others, might be added the form of the filaments, as capillary,
flat, wedgeform, &s;piral, awled; and al&s;o the forms and &s;ituations
of the anthers, as globular, oblong, arrowy, angular, horned.
Which may be &s;een in the Philo&s;ophia Botanica of Linnaeus, p.
65; or a translation of them in Miln's Botanical Dictionary,
under the titles of filament and anther. All which, I &s;uppo&s;e,
are much le&s;s variable by &s;oil or climate, than the numbers of
their re&s;pective &s;exual organs, and would in the hands of an
ingenious botani&s;t form more natural cla&s;&s;ifications.</P>
<P>5. Cla&s;&s;ical characters might perhaps be taken from the length
of the filaments compared to that of the &s;tyle, with &s;ome other
concomitant circum&s;tances; as fir&s;t where they are &s;omewhat
&s;horter than the &s;tyle, as in the pendent bell-flowers of lily, fri|tillaria,
campanula. Secondly where the filaments are more
than twice as &s;hort as the &s;tyle, as in meadia, cyclamen, &s;olanum,
borago, fu&s;chia. Or thirdly where the filaments are more than
twice as long as the &s;tyle, and in the natural order of gra&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Secondly, the unequal heights of the filaments at the fir&s;t
opening of the corol. In many flowers the inferior &s;et of &s;ta|mina
ri&s;e up to the &s;tigma, when the higher &s;et have di&s;charged
their pollen. To the&s;e &s;ituations of the &s;tamina may al&s;o be
added their number, as in the two very natural cla&s;&s;es of Lin|naeus,
the didynamia and the tetradynamia. One of the&s;e
might be termed two higher than two; the other four higher
than two. To which might perhaps be added a third cla&s;s, of
many higher than many; as &s;ix above &s;ix in lithrum &s;alicaria,
$$ve above five in lychnis.</P>
<P><PB N="520" REF="525">
Thirdly, the different in&s;ertions of the filaments, as fir&s;t on
the calyx, which principally di&s;tingui&s;hes the cla&s;s ico&s;andria of
Linnaeus, and which thus approaches towards a natural cla&s;s.
Secondly on the receptacle, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the cla&s;s poly|andria
of Linnaeus, which al&s;o approaches toward a natural
cla&s;s. And thirdly, the in&s;ertion of the filaments alternately to
the claws of the petals, and to the receptacle; which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
a part of the natural order of the caryophyllei, in which
the number of the &s;tamina is very various.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the &s;ituation of the filaments in re&s;pect to each
other; as fir&s;t in the natural order of Linnaeus termed &s;tellatae,
or a part of the tetrandria monogynia; the diverging filaments
oppo&s;e each other, and might be termed cruciform, as in galium,
a&s;perula. Or &s;econdly, where five diverging filaments a&s;&s;ume
the appearance of a &s;tar, as in the natural order of umbellatae, or a
part of pentandria digynia, and might have a name borrowed
al&s;o from their number, like five-&s;tarred, or cinque-pointed,
applied to the filaments, as mentioned above.</P>
<P>Fifthly, the adhe&s;ions of the filaments to each other at their
ba&s;e. This has given names to three cla&s;&s;es of the Linnaean

as fir&s;t, where the filaments all adhere at their ba&s;e,
as in the cla&s;s monadelphia; &s;econdly, where they adhere in two
&s;ets, as in the cla&s;s diadelphia: and thirdly, where they adhere
in many &s;ets, as in the cla&s;s polyadelphia.</P>
<P>Sixthly, the adhe&s;ions of the filaments to the coral, as where
they adhere more than half their length to the internal part of
it, as in many monopetalous flowers, as primula, auricula; or
where the filament ari&s;es from the petal, or where the anthers
adhere to the margin of the petal, as in many of the natural order
of &s;citamineae, as ob&s;erved in the Praelect. in Ord. Natur. a
Gi&s;eke, p. 189.</P>
<P>Seventhly, where the filaments adhere to the &s;tyle, as in the
cla&s;s gynandria, which approaches to a natural one.</P>
<P>Eighthly, the &s;ituations of the &s;tamina not in the &s;ame flowers
with the pi&s;tillum. This has al&s;o given names to three cla&s;&s;es of
the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem, monoecia, dioecia, polygamia.</P>
<P><PB N="521" REF="526">
Ninthly, the connexion of the anthers, which has given the
name to the cla&s;s &s;yngene&s;ia, which excepting the la&s;t order, is a
wonderfully exten&s;ive and natural cla&s;s.</P>
<P>To the&s;e varieties of &s;ituation, proportion, and adhe&s;ion, of
the filaments, may be added tho&s;e of the anthers on their &s;um|mits;
which to an attentive ob&s;erver may perhaps be as numerous
as tho&s;e of the filaments, and to the&s;e may again be added the
various forms of the filaments, as capillary, flat, wedgeform,
&s;piral, feathered, &amp;c. and al&s;o the various forms of the anthers,
as oblong, globular, arrowy, angular, horned. All which are
de&s;cribed in the Philo&s;ophia Botanica. And by an adoption of
&s;ome of the&s;e &s;eparately or in conjunction for cla&s;&s;ical characters,
I &s;hould hope that new cla&s;&s;ifications might be di&s;covered in&s;tead
of tho&s;e, which are &s;imply numerical. Which might be more
natural ones, le&s;s &s;ubject to variation, ea&s;ier to be di&s;tingui&s;hed
from each other, and more &s;imilar in their good or bad qualities:
and might thus add to the great beauty and utility of the pre&s;ent
wonderful arrangement of &s;o many thou&s;and vegetables in the
Linnaean &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>6. The &s;ame ob&s;ervations and mode of rea&s;oning are applica|ble
to the various orders of the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem. Which if the
great Linnaeus had fortunately deduced them from the proporti|ons,
&s;ituations, or forms of the &s;tyles and &s;tigmas, the characte|ri&s;tic
&s;igns might have been le&s;s liable to change by &s;oil or climate,
and many of the orders have been more natural collections of
vegetables, than tho&s;e are, which he has derived &s;imply from
their number.</P>
<P>The uncertainty, of the number of pi&s;tilla, and the confu&s;ion,
which might be occa&s;ioned by a reliance on it, was mentioned in
No. 2 of this &s;ection; there is a nigella pentagyna, and a nigella
decagyna; there is an hypericum floribus pentagynis, trigynis,
and digynis; and in the whole order of fru&s;traneous polygamy
in the cla&s;s &s;yngene&s;ia the florets of the ray are furni&s;hed with a
&s;tyle and no &s;tigma, as in the &s;unflower.</P>
<P>The flowers of the polygonum, who&s;e cla&s;&s;ical character is
octandria, and its order trigynia, affords many instances of the
uncertainty of the number of the &s;exual organs, both in re&s;pect
to the &s;tamina and pi&s;tilla. Thus the &s;pecies 4, 5, 6, 7, po&s;&s;e&s;s
<PB N="522" REF="527">
but five &s;tamina in each; the &s;pecies 8, 9, 10, have each of
them &s;ix &s;tamina, and the eleventh &s;pecies has &s;even &s;tamina.
And la&s;tly, the &s;pecies 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, have each of them
but two pi&s;tilla, and all the re&s;t three pi&s;tilla.</P>
<P>From the&s;e and other innamerable in&s;tances there is rea&s;on to
conclude, that the proportions, &s;ituations, and forms of the
&s;tyle and &s;tigma, to which might be added their number con|jointly,
would have made e&s;&s;ential characters for the orders,
which would have been le&s;s variable than tho&s;e derived only
from the number of them, and would have rendered them more
natural collections.</P>
<P>7. The characters of the orders might be deduced fir&s;t from
the length of the &s;tyle compared with that of the filaments; as
where the &s;tyle is more than twice as long as the filaments, as
in meadia, cyclamen, &s;olanum, fu&s;chia. Secondly, where the
&s;tyle is about one third longer than the filaments, as in lilium,
fritillaria, campanula, and many other bell-flowers. Thirdly,
where the &s;tyle is very &s;hort compared to the filaments, as in
poppies.</P>
<P>2. The characters of the orders might be deduced from the
curvatures of the &s;tyle. As fir&s;t, where the &s;tyle bends into a
curve over the anthers to bring the &s;tigma into contact with
them, as in nigella, devil in the bu&s;h. Secondly, where the
&s;tyle bends into a circle like a french-horn to accommodate the
&s;tigma to two &s;ets of &s;tamina in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, fir&s;t the lower, and
then the higher, as in &s;partium &s;coparium, common broom.
Thirdly, where the &s;tyle is crooked in the middle of it, making
a kind of zigzag, to lower the &s;tigma to the anthers beneath it,
as in hemerocallis fulva, tawny day-lily.</P>
<P>3. Characters might be deduced from the attitude of the &s;tyle;
as where it is pendent, that the &s;tigma may be accommodated
to the anothers above it, as in many bell-flowers. Secondly,
where it is inclined at a con&s;iderable angle to accommodate the
&s;tigma to the inclined anthers, as in epilobium, willow-herb,
and glorio&s;a &s;uperba. Thirdly, where the &s;tyle is erect,
to adapt the &s;tigma to the upright anthers, as in many
flowers.</P>
<P><PB N="523" REF="528">
4. Where the divi&s;ions of the &s;tigma expand, and bend down
toward the anthers beneath them, as in &s;ome kinds of dianthus,
pink, and in epilobium.</P>
<P>5. The total ab&s;ence of the &s;tyle might mark an order.</P>
<P>6. The total ab&s;ence of the &s;tigma, which is a characteri&s;tic
mark of the florets of the ray in the order fru&s;traneous poly|gamy
of the cla&s;s &s;yngene&s;ia.</P>
<P>7. Where the &s;tyle adheres to the &s;tamina, as in the natural
order of Linnaeus termed calamatiae, as ob&s;erved in Philo&s;.
Botanica, No. 102, on the Pi&s;tilla, p. 68.</P>
<P>8. When &s;tyle &s;upports the &s;tamina as in the cla&s;s gynan|dria.</P>
<P>9. Where the &s;tyle appears to exi&s;t both above and below the
germ, as in capparis, euphorbia.</P>
<P>10. The lateral adhe&s;ion of the &s;tyle to the germ, as in one
of the natural orders of Linnaeus, which he has termed &s;entico&s;ae,
or briers, which includes the ro&s;e, ra&s;pberry, &s;trawberry, agri|mony,
alchemilla, and many others, which might be named
from the lateral adhe&s;ion of the &s;tyle to the germ, which Lin|naeus
a&s;&s;erts to exi&s;t both in the natural order above mentioned,
and in the order Ico&s;andria polygyna. Philo&s;. Botan. p. 67.</P>
<P>If to the&s;e proportions or &s;ituations of the &s;tyle were added
the varieties of its figure, as cylindrical, angular, awled, capil|lary;
and to the&s;e were again added the divi&s;ions of the &s;tigma,
as convolute, revolute, &s;ix-parted, many-parted. And to the&s;e
were again added the various forms of the &s;tigma, as globular,
egged, end-nicked, cruciform, feathery, &amp;c. which are enu|merated
in the Philo&s;ophia Botanica; there is great rea&s;on to
believe, that characteri&s;tic marks of all the orders of plants might
be deduced and named from &s;ome of tho&s;e circum&s;tances &s;epa|rately
or conjointly; which might di&s;tingui&s;h them from each

<HEAD>Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>Neverthele&s;s I am well aware of the great general inconve|nience
of altering &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;y&s;tem once e&s;tabli&s;hed, and am
&s;orry to &s;ee &s;ome idle efforts to add the cla&s;&s;es already deduced
from &s;ituation or proportion to tho&s;e, which are &s;imply numeri|cal;
and thus rather to deteriorate than to improve the pre&s;ent
&s;y&s;tem of the great ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I profe&s;s my&s;elf incapable to execute the plan, which I have
here &s;ugge&s;ted, as it would require a mo&s;t exact knowledge of
the detail of botany, as well as of the outline; would require
many years of unremitted application, with every opportunity of
vi&s;iting botanic gardens, or examining dry collections, and in|&s;pecting
prints and drawings of vegetables; and would demand
a genius which few po&s;&s;e&s;s, capable of reducing the complex and
intricate to the &s;imple and explicit.</P>
<P>But if the &s;y&s;tem of the great Linnaeus can ever be intrin&s;ically

the &s;ituations, proportions, or forms, with or without the numbers
of the &s;exual organs, as criterions of the orders and cla&s;&s;es, mu&s;t
lay the foundation; but that it mu&s;t require a great architect to
erect the &s;uper&s;tructure. And my principal de&s;ign in adjoining

<HEAD>ADDITIONAL NOTES.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>1. To be in&s;erted before the la&s;t paragraph of Sect. IV. 2. 1. at p. 42, line 20.</HEAD>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent year 1799, Augu&s;t 18, there was an uncom|mon
&s;ummer-&s;tood on the Derwent, which covered my garden
above three feet deep with muddy water. Many plants of the
rheum hybridum, mule rhubarb, which were tran&s;planted in the
&s;pring, and had not flowered, had their large pointed leaves cover|ed
with mud, &s;o as to render the green colour totally invi&s;ible
after the water &s;ub&s;ided. They appeared &s;trong as before for a day
or two, and then every one withered and dropped down. The
&s;ame happened to the leaves of many other vegetables, and to
e&s;pallier apple-trees, as high as they were immer&s;ed; which
was doubtle&s;s owing to their re&s;piration being precluded by the
veil over them of a &s;ine tenacious mud. See Sect. VII. 2. 6.</P>

<P>The rheum hybridum, mule rhubarb, de&s;cribed in Murray's
Sy&s;tema Vegetabilium, edition the fourteenth, I believe to be
produced between the palmated rhubarb, and the common rhu|barb
of our gardens, or rheum rhaphonticum; as it appeared
both in my garden and my neighbours among&s;t a mixture of
tho&s;e two kinds of rhubarb, without being previou&s;ly placed or
&s;own there. The leaf is very large and pointed, without being
palmated, and is a week or two forwarder in the &s;pring than
either of the other rhubarbs, and the peeled &s;talks are a&s;&s;erted
by connoi&s;&s;eurs in eating to make the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible of all tarts,
much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the palmated or rhaphontic rhubarb;
and are &s;o much more valuable as a luxury, as they precede by

<P>Mr. Ruckert planted two beans in pots of equal &s;ize filled with
garden-mould; the one was watered almo&s;t daily with di&s;tilled
water, and the other with water impregnated with carbonic
acid gas, in the proportion of half a cubic inch to an ounce of
water; and both of them were expo&s;ed to all the influence of
the atmo&s;phere except to the rain. The bean treated with the
carbonic acid water appeared above ground nine days &s;ooner than
that moi&s;tened with di&s;tilled water, and produced twenty-five
beans; whereas the other pot produced only fifteen. The &s;ame

<P>Be&s;ides which the vitriolic acid abounding in many clays,
when brought into contact with mild calcareous earth, by the
various operations of agriculture, mu&s;t unite with it, and &s;et at
liberty the carbonic acid either in a fluid form, or a ga&s;&s;eous
form beneath the &s;oil; which is known to be &s;o friendly to ve|getation,
when applied to the roots of plants; and at the &s;ame
time a gyp&s;um will be produced, which is now al&s;o believed to
be u&s;eful in agriculture.</P>
<P>Mr. Kirwan a&s;&s;erts, &startq;That the gyp&s;um u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s&punc; in
agriculture is of a fibrous texture; and that clay lands, he be|lieves,
to be more improved by it than calcareous ones. The
time of &s;preading it is in February or March, and it is then to
be thinly &s;trewed on gra&s;s-land at the rate of about eight bu&s;hels
to an acre; as more he &s;ays would be hurtful. He further
adds that the theory of its effects is to be deduced from its ex|traordinary
&s;ceptic power; as it is found to accelerate putrefac|tion
in a higher degree than any other &s;ub&s;tance, (Hi&s;toire de
Putrefaction, p. 36), whence it is not to be ploughed in, but
<PB N="527" REF="532">
barely to be &s;trewed on the &s;urface of the land in the month of
February, to convert the old gra&s;s quickly into coal to nouri&s;h
the young growths.&endq;</P>
<P>I have tran&s;cribed the above from Mr. Kirwan's Treati&s;e on
Manures, but am liable to doubt the experiments concerning
bodies promoting putrefaction; as the progre&s;s of that proce&s;s
has generally been only judged of by the odour; which may
po&s;&s;ibly be altered or de&s;troyed by many bodies, by their uniting
with it without otherwi&s;e affecting the tendency to di&s;&s;olution.
Add to this another circum&s;tance, &s;hewing the uncertainty of
the&s;e deductions, that &s;ome of the&s;e anti&s;eptic materials, as &s;ea|&s;alt,
and lime, are &s;aid to promote putrefaction, when u&s;ed in
&s;mall quantities; and to &s;uppre&s;s it, when u&s;ed in large ones.</P>

<HEAD>5. To be in&s;erted in Sect. XIII. 2. 2. at the end of the paragraph which mentions Mr. Lawrence's letter to Mr. Bradley.</HEAD>
<P>Another thing, which renders low &s;ituations le&s;s proper for
gardens, is, that I believe them to be much more liable to be
infe&s;ted by the aphis; as leaves of the nut-trees in my garden
on the banks of the Derwent are every year crowded with in|numerable
aphi&s;es on their inferior &s;urfaces, and yet I have &s;een
few, if any of them, on nut-trees in &s;ome higher &s;ituations,
which I happened to in&s;pect Add to this, that the great
honey-dew, mentioned in Sect. XIV. 1. 7. was produced on a
row of willows by the &s;ide of water. This may neverthele&s;s be
in part a&s;cribed to &s;ome other local circum&s;tance; as I this
year ob&s;erved numerous large black aphides round the &s;talks of
garden-beans on a clayey &s;oil, which did not exi&s;t in my garden,
which may be called a carbonic &s;oil. Though on the peach
and nectarine trees, again&s;t the walls in my low garden, and on
&s;ome plum-trees, the aphides exi&s;t almo&s;t every year in &s;uch
de&s;tructive multitudes as to prevent the fruit from &s;ucceeding,
and thence to render them not worth cultivation; and to ren|der
the leaves of the nut-trees le&s;s in &s;ize, and le&s;s prolific than
other nut-trees on a more elevated and clayey &s;oil, with which
I this year compared them.</P>
<P>Why the aphis &s;hould be &s;o much more numerous in moi&s;t
&s;ituations is a curious &s;ubject of inquiry, but is &s;o &s;imilar to
<PB N="528" REF="533">
another animal fact, that they may illu&s;trate each other. The
cough and coo&s;equent con&s;umption of &s;heep, which occurs an|nually
in moi&s;t &s;ituations, is owing to an in&s;ect called a fleuk|worm,
about the &s;ize and &s;hape of a child's finger-nail, which
creeps up the gall ducts from the inte&s;tines and preys upon the
livers of &s;heep; as may be &s;een in moi&s;t &s;ea&s;ons in our &s;hambles.
This &s;eems to occur from the bile becoming too dilute from &s;o
much watery nouri&s;hment in tho&s;e animals, and that thence it
does not po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient bitterne&s;s or acrimony to prevent the
depredations of the&s;e in&s;ects, as in drier &s;ea&s;ons. On the &s;ame
account I &s;u&s;pect the juices of nut-trees and of willows planted
in very moi&s;t &s;ituations may be rendered too dilute; but that in
higher &s;ituations they may po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient acrimony or bitterne&s;s
mixed with the &s;ap-juice to prevent the depredations of the
aphis. See Sect. XIV. 2. 8.</P>

<P>Having now &s;poken of carbon, of lime, and of clay, which
with &s;iliceous &s;and con&s;titute the principal ingredients of fertile
&s;oils, &s;ome rules may be required for di&s;tingui&s;hing the goodne&s;s
of &s;oils by the purcha&s;er, as well as by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. For this
purpo&s;e the chemical analy&s;is would fir&s;t pre&s;ent it&s;elf, as at|tempted
by Fordyce, many years ago, and lately by Giobert,
Bergmen, Kirwan, and others.</P>
<P>M. Giobert found, that one pound of a fertile &s;oil in the vici|nity
of Turin contained of carbonic matter, which would burn
and flame, about twenty-five grains, of flinty &s;and about 4400
grains, of clay about 600 grains, of lime about 400 grains, and
la&s;tly, of water about 70 grains. The &s;ame author found that
one pound of &s;ome barren &s;oils was compo&s;ed of &s;iliceous earth
about 3000 grains, of argillaceous earth about 600 grains, and
of calcareous earth about 400 grains, and I &s;upppo&s;e without any
carbonic matter.</P>
<P>Mr. Kirwan ingeniou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that the quantity of moi&s;|ture,
which &s;ome countries are more liable to than others, &s;hould
be nicely attended to, at the &s;ame time that you e&s;timate the fer|tility
of land by its analy&s;is, as moi&s;t climates or &s;ituations may
require more &s;and than drier ones; and therefore the &s;ame com|ponent
parts of &s;oil would not be the mo&s;t fertile, on both the
we&s;tern and ea&s;tern coa&s;ts of this i&s;land; as the former expe|riences
more rain than the latter; nor on the &s;ummit, declivity,
<PB N="530" REF="535">
and ba&s;e of mo&s;t mountains which differ in their degree of moi&s;|ture.</P>
<P>It appears from hence, that the chemical analy&s;is of &s;oils is
not yet arrived at &s;ufficient accuracy to be depended upon with
certainty to di&s;cover their degrees of fertility. But as the car|bonic
part of &s;oil probably contributes mo&s;t to the growth of ve|getables,
and next to that the calcareous part; there is rea&s;on
to conclude, that if a few pounds of different &s;oils are dried by
the &s;ame degree of heat, and then weighed, and afterwards ex|po&s;ed
to a red heat in an open fire; that the &s;oil, which lo&s;es
mo&s;t weight, is probably the mo&s;t fertile; becau&s;e the carbonic
matter will almo&s;t all e&s;cape in flame, and almo&s;t half the weight
of the calcareous earth in carbonic acid.</P>
<P>Another method of giving &s;ome conjecture concerning the fer|tility
of a &s;oil may be by examining its &s;pecific gravity; as the &s;pe|cific
gravity of garden-mould is &s;aid by Mu&s;chenbroek to be
1, 630, compared to 1, 000 of water. And Fabroni found the
&s;pecific gravity of barren &s;andy land to be 2, 210 to 1, 000 of
water. This experiment would not be difficult to try with &s;uf|ficient
accuracy by drying two different &s;oils at an equal di&s;tance
from a fire, or in the &s;ame oven, and then weighing a pound of
each in a thin bladder with apertures near its top or neck; and
then letting the bladder &s;ink &s;o low into water, as to admit the
water through the apertures among&s;t the &s;oil; and la&s;tly, ob&s;erv|ing
the difference between their re&s;pective weights in air, and in
water.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the method mo&s;t in u&s;e by the purcha&s;ers of land
to judge of its valu&egrave; is by attending to the growth and colour of
the vegetables, which cover it; which requires an experienced
eye, and cannot be ea&s;ily de&s;cribed in words. Add to this that
vegetables which grow wild on &s;oils, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure indi|cate
the nature of them. As the digitalis, and arenarea, are
found generally on &s;andy &s;oils, the veronica becabunga, and
cre&s;&s;es of &s;ome kinds, belong to moi&s;t &s;ituations and others to
mountainous ones. A particular catalogue of &s;uch plants, as
&s;pontaneou&s;ly grow in different &s;ituations, might a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;cover|ing
the degree of fertility, and the nature of the &s;oil; as other
flowers by the time of their opening in each climate, which is
<PB N="531" REF="536">
termed the Calendar of Flora, may teach the temperature of the
&s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of the country the &s;pontaneous production of
many docks, rumex, has been reckoned the mark of an inferior
&s;oil, and the production of thi&s;tles, &s;erratula arven&s;is, to be a
&s;ign of a good one; which explains a &s;tory in a black letter
book on hu&s;bandry, which &s;ays, &startq;A blind man went to pur|cha&s;e

<P>To di&s;cover when the &s;eeds of herbaceous plants are ripe, as
of wheat, the dryne&s;s or &s;traw-colour of the &s;tem is in general
a good criterion; as when the &s;tem dies, and becomes bleached
by the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere, no more nutriment can be
conveyed to the mature &s;eed. And to determine at what time to
collect tho&s;e fruits, which never ripen on the trees in this cli|mate,
as crab-apples, and baking-pears, change of colour or
fall of the leaf &s;hews, that they can acquire no more nouri&s;h|ment,
and may receive injury from the approaching fro&s;t.</P>
<P>But to determine when our be&s;t or earlie&s;t apples and pears
are ripe enough to gather, that is, when they will acquire no
more nutriment from the tree, depends on a very curious circum|&s;tance
of the colour of the &s;kin of the &s;eeds. During the infant
&s;tate of the &s;eed there is no cavity round them, but the &s;eed is
in contact with the &s;eed-ve&s;&s;el, as may be &s;een on cutting an un|ripe
pear or apple; and the &s;eed therefore is perfectly etiolated,
as it cannot part with any of its oxygen. Afterwards when
there is no more depo&s;ition of nutritious matter to enlarge the
fruit, the cells, in which the &s;eeds are contained, become hollow,
producing an air-ve&s;&s;el for the living embryon; of what purity
<PB N="532" REF="537">
the air may be, which is produced in the&s;e cells, has not I
believe been tried, and may differ as the embryon-&s;eed grows
older; but the oxygen, which it contains, &s;eems to have been
di&s;engaged from the membranes, which cover the &s;eeds, which
thence become coloured; whence the dark colour of the &s;eeds of
apples and pears is a proper criterion of the time, when they
&s;hould be gathered; as it indicates, that the fruit will no longer
increa&s;e in &s;ize, as it now wa&s;tes and becomes hollow by ab&s;orb|ing
&s;ome of the mucilage from the central parts of it.</P>

<P>Sugar is not only afforded by the &s;ap-flow of trees, as the
maple, birch, and vine, but al&s;o I &s;uppo&s;e from that of herba|ceous
vegetables, as heracleum &s;pondilium, cow par&s;nip, and
&s;erratula arven&s;is, field thi&s;tle; when the former of the&s;e plants
has been cut off near the ground in the vernal months, the &s;ap-juice
from the &s;tump I have ob&s;erved to flow in &s;uch quantity for
many days, that I have doubted whether by a proper apparatus
for catching it the plant might not be advantageou&s;ly cultivated
for the purpo&s;e of making wine, or of extracting the &s;ugar as
from the maple of America. This circum&s;tance has been &s;aid
to &s;hew a proper time for de&s;troying the weeds, as if they be
mowed in the bleeding &s;ea&s;on, they are believed to peri&s;h by
the lo&s;s of &s;ap-juice.</P>
<P>As all &s;pirit is the &s;ame, when nicely di&s;tilled, whether it be
found in wine, ale, cyder, brandy, rum, gin, and is the product
of &s;ugar by the chemical proce&s;s of fermentation; and as all
&s;ugar is the &s;ame, when nicely cleaned, whether it be obtained
from fruits, grains, roots, canes, or &s;ap-juice; there is rea&s;on
to believe, that &s;ugar as well as &s;pirit may &s;ome time or other be
economically procured from the vegetables of this climate, as
Margraff extracted it from the beet-root, and from potatoes.
For the &s;trength of common ale, which is produced from the
&s;ugar contained in malt, is &s;aid to be about the &s;ame as that of
&s;ome dome&s;tic wines, which owe their &s;pirit to prepared &s;ugar.
And as in the former a bu&s;hel or &s;trike of malt is u&s;ed to about
&s;ix gallons of water, and in the latter about twenty pounds of
<PB N="533" REF="538">
&s;ugar to &s;ix gallons of water, it follows, that one &s;trike of malt
contains about twenty pounds of &s;ugar; which if an ea&s;y method
of cleaning it from the mucilage and from the e&s;&s;ential oil of the
&s;eed could be di&s;covered, it may &s;ome time be manufactured at
home cheaper, than it can be procured from abroad.</P>
<P>We may add, as all &s;ugar is the &s;ame, and all &s;pirit is the &s;ame,
from whatever plant they are procured; that the flavours of wines
differ from each other &s;olely in the e&s;&s;ential oil, which they con|tain,
or the quantity of acidity, or of &s;ugar not yet fermented;
and that in re&s;pect to whole&s;omene&s;s wines only differ from each
other in their &s;trength or quantity of &s;pirit, unle&s;s where &s;ome
noxious material has been u&s;ed to fine them, or to counteract
their tendency to the acetous fermentation, as lead has been
employed in &s;ome of the cyders of our country, and in &s;ome of
the white wines of France, to correct their acidity; and it is
&s;aid that ar&s;enic is occa&s;ionally employed for the purpo&s;e of fining
white wines.</P>
<P>The injurious methods of fining wines, and of &s;topping their
tendency to acidity having been mentioned, the innocuous ones
ought to be &s;ubjoined; for the former it has been propo&s;ed to
filter muddy wine through fine &s;and laid on a &s;ieve; but this I
am told does not &s;ucceed, as the mucilage of the foul wine &s;oon
fills up the inter&s;tices of the grain of &s;ands; but that an efficaci|ous
method is to &s;hower the fine &s;and on the wine through a
&s;ieve; which as it pa&s;&s;es down by its own weight will carry the
muoilaginous mud of the wine along with it. And la&s;tly, if
&s;ome colouring particles cannot thus be made to &s;ub&s;ide, a litttle
more &s;imple mucilage mu&s;t be added, as gum arabic or whites of
eggs, and a &s;and-&s;hower be again pa&s;&s;ed through it.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the tendency of wines to become vinegar, this I
am informed may be prevented by not expo&s;ing the fermenting
material to the air more than can be ea&s;ily prevented, as it is the
union of the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere with the &s;pirit that con|verts
it into vinegar; and though the vinous fermentation pro|ceeds
flower, when &s;ecluded from the air, yet it finally becomes
more perfect; as the &s;ugar in &s;weet wines continues to become
&s;pirit, after it is corked up in bottles, though the proce&s;s is flower,
<PB N="534" REF="539">
and the wine con&s;equently becomes &s;tronger as it grows older,
and the &s;weetne&s;s vani&s;hes.</P>
<P>Hence I ob&s;erve the manufacturers of rai&s;in-wines &s;et them to
ferment in large ca&s;ks with only the bung-hole open, that they
may not be too much expo&s;ed to the atmo&s;phere; and &s;oon &s;top
them up or bottle them, before the &s;weetne&s;s vani&s;hes, which
they judge of by the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>I was once told by a gentleman, who made a con&s;iderable
quantity of cyder on his own e&s;tate, that he had procured ve&s;&s;els
of &s;tronger con&s;truction than u&s;ual, and that he directed the ap|ple-juice,
as &s;oon as it had &s;ettled, to be bunged up clo&s;e; and
that though he had had one ve&s;&s;el or two occa&s;ionally bur&s;t by
the expan&s;ion of the fermenting liquor, yet that this rarely occur|red,
and that his cyder never failed to be of the mo&s;t excellent
quality, and took a con&s;iderably greater price at market.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould this account of fermentation be concluded without
ob&s;erving, that it converts &s;ugar, which is a whole&s;ome nutriment
both to young and old, into &s;pirit, which is a poi&s;onous material
to all; as it &s;timulates the whole &s;y&s;tem into too violent exertion
for a few hours, and leaves it afterwards in con&s;equence torpid
and inactive; and hence that the &s;tronge&s;t wines are the mo&s;t
pernicious, and that all of them &s;hould be diluted with water.
As tho&s;e in general, who drink ale to exce&s;s, acquire the gravel;
tho&s;e, who drink wine to exce&s;s, acquire the gout; and the
drinkers of &s;pirits die of the drop&s;y!&mdash;but it is the cu&s;tom of

<P>An important paper concerning lime is this year publi&s;hed in
the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions by Mr. Tennant, who having
been informed, that two kinds of lime were u&s;ed in agriculture
which differed greatly in their effects, one of which it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to u&s;e &s;paringly, and to &s;pread very evenly over the land;
for it was &s;aid, that a large proportion of it dimini&s;hed the ferti|lity
of the &s;oil; and that wherever a heap of it had been left on
one &s;pot, all vegetation was prevented for many years. And
<PB N="535" REF="540">
that of this kind of lime fifty or &s;ixty bu&s;hels on an acre were as
much as could be u&s;ed with advantage; while of the other &s;ort
of lime a large quantity was never found to be injurious; and
that the &s;pots, which were entirely covered with it, became re|markably
fertile, In&s;tead of being rendered barren.</P>
<P>Mr. Tennant having analy&s;ed tho&s;e two kinds of lime found,
that the latter con&s;i&s;ted &s;olely of calcareous earth; but that the
former contained two parts of magnefia with three parts of cal|careous
earth. He afterwards ob&s;erved, that though vegetable
&s;eeds would grow equally well in both the&s;e kinds of lime&s;tone,
when &s;imply reduced to powder; yet that, when they were cal|cined
&s;o as to become lime, and both of them &s;trewed about the
tenth of an inch thick on garden mould, that the magne&s;ian
lime prevented nearly all the &s;eeds, which had been &s;owed,
from coming up; while no injury was occa&s;ioned by the calcare|ous
lime u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>This important di&s;covery &s;eems to explain the cau&s;e of &s;uch
variety of opinion about the u&s;e of lime, which &s;ome have be|lieved
to be of no advantage, and even injurious to land; which
has probably been owing to their having u&s;ed the magne&s;ian lime,
and having laid on too much of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Tennant fir&s;t found magne&s;ian lime near the town of
Donca&s;ter, and afterwards at York, at Matlock in Derby&s;hire,
and at Breeden in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and at Work&s;op in Notting|ham&s;hire.
He ob&s;erves, that the cathedral and walls of York
are built with this magne&s;ian lime&s;tone; and that at Matlock
the magne&s;ian and calcareous lime&s;tones are contiguous to each
other; the rocks on the &s;ide of the river Derwent, where the
hou&s;es are built, being magne&s;ian, and on the other &s;ide calca|reous.
He ob&s;erved al&s;o here, that the magne&s;ian lime&s;tone was
incumbent on the calcareous; for in de&s;cending into a cave
formed in that rock, he found a &s;eparate vein of calcareous lime|&s;tone,
which was full of &s;hells, but contained no magne&s;ia; and
ob&s;erves in general, that magne&s;ian lime&s;tone may be readily di&s;|tingui&s;hed
from the calcareous by its &s;o much &s;lower &s;olution in
acids, and that it contains generally very few &s;hells, but that
tho&s;e al&s;o are impregnated with magne&s;ia.</P>
<P><PB N="536" REF="541">
As all lime&s;tone may be divided into three kinds; the rocks,
which remain, where they were formed from &s;hells beneath the
ocean, except that they were afterwards elevated by &s;ubmarine
fires; and &s;econdly into alluvial lime&s;tone, as tho&s;e which have
been di&s;&s;olved in water, and &s;imply precipitated, as the beds of
chalk, which contain only the mo&s;t in&s;oluble remains of &s;ea-animals,
as the teeth of &s;harks; and thirdly tho&s;e which af|ter
having been di&s;&s;olved and precipitated, have been long agitated
beneath the &s;ea, till the particles have been rolled &s;o again&s;t each
other, as to acquire a globular form, which is &s;aid to re&s;emble
the roe, or &s;pawn, of fi&s;h, and which contain very few &s;hells
or none, as the Ketton &s;tone, and that which I have &s;eea on
Lincoln Heath extending almo&s;t from Sleaford to Lincoln.</P>
<P>Now as the &s;alts of the &s;ea con&s;i&s;t of only two kinds, com|mon
&s;alt, or muriat of &s;oda, and vitriolated magne&s;ia, commonly
called Ep&s;om &s;alt, which in the &s;ea-waters &s;urrounding this
i&s;land were found at a medium to exi&s;t in the proportion of one
thirtieth part of common &s;alt, and one eightieth part of vitrio|lated
magne&s;ia compared to the quantity of water. And &s;e|condly
as the&s;e &s;alts are believed by many philo&s;ophers to have
been formed by vegetable and animal matters, which principally
grew upon the &s;urface of the dry land, after it was rai&s;ed out of
the primeval ocean; and that in con&s;equence the &s;altne&s;s of the
&s;ea was po&s;terior to the formation of the primeval rocks of lime|&s;tone;
and from hence we under&s;tand, why tho&s;e lime&s;tone
&s;trata, which have not been di&s;&s;olved or wa&s;hed in &s;ea-water
&s;ince the &s;ea became &s;alt, are not mixed with magne&s;ia.</P>
<P>The chalk mu&s;t have been di&s;&s;olved and precipitated from
water, as it exactly re&s;embles the internal part of &s;ome calcare|ous
&s;talactites, which I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; yet there is no ap|pearance
of its component particles having been rubbed together
into &s;mall globules, and may not therefore have been removed
from the &s;ituation, where it was produced, except by its eleva|tion
above the &s;urface of the ocean.</P>
<P>But that alluvial lime&s;tone, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall globules
adhering together, called Ketton lime&s;tone, and of which
there appears to be a bed ten miles broad from Beckingham to
Sleaford in Lincoln&s;hire, and twenty miles long from Sleaford
<PB N="537" REF="542">
to Lincoln, I &s;u&s;pect may probably con&s;i&s;t of magne&s;ian lime&s;tone
which is al&s;o &s;aid in that country to do no &s;ervice to vegetation;
for this alluvial lime&s;tone by having evidently been long rolled
together beneath the &s;ea, by which the &s;mall cry&s;talli&s;ed parts of
it have had their angles rubbed off, is mo&s;t likely to have thus
been mixed with the magne&s;ia of the &s;ea-water, which is &s;aid to
contain one eightieth part of its weight of vitriolated magne&s;ia,
as above mentioned.</P>
<P>At the lime-works at Ticknal near Derby there appears a
&s;tratum of alluvial lime&s;tone, like Ketton lime&s;tone, which they
do not burn for &s;ale, over the bed of the calcareous-lime&s;tone,
which they get from beneath the former, and calcine for &s;ale. It
is probable, that the &s;uperior bed may contain magne&s;ia, which
has rendered it not &s;o u&s;eful in agriculture.</P>
<P>It is more probable, that alluvial lime&s;tone has acquired its
mixture of magne&s;ia from the &s;ea-water; as magne&s;ia in its un|calcined
&s;tate will precipitate lime from water, as ob&s;erved by Dr.
Al&s;ton; who thence propo&s;es to render water pure and potable,
which has been long kept at &s;ea free from putridity by having
lime mixed with it, by precipitating the lime by the addition of
mild magne&s;ia; which is a &s;ubject now perhaps worthy the at|tention
of the court of admiralty, &s;ince magne&s;ian lime&s;tone
appears to be &s;o plentifully diffu&s;ed over the earth. See Dr.
Black's Exper. on Magne&s;ia in the E&s;&s;ay Philo&s;. and Literary,
Edinb.</P>
<P>The lime from Breedon is magne&s;ian, that from Ticknal
(which is &s;old) is calcareous lime I believe; and &s;ome farmers
in the vicinity of Derby a&s;&s;ert, that two loads of Breedon lime
will <HI>go as far,</HI> that is will apparently do as much &s;ervice to their
land as three loads of Ticknal lime. Breedon lime, I am al&s;o
informed, is preferred in architecture, and is &s;aid <HI>to go further</HI> in
making mortar; which I &s;uppo&s;e means, that it requires more
&s;and to be mixed with it. Mr. Marshall in his account of the
agriculture of the Midland counties &s;peaks of lime made at
Breedon near Derby as de&s;tructive to vegetables when u&s;ed in
large quantities. And in Nottingham&s;hire it is afferted, that
the lime from Critch in Derby&s;hire is &s;o mild, that thi&s;tles and
gra&s;s &s;pring up through the edges of large heaps of it, when laid
in the fields. Dr. Fenwick of Newca&s;tle ob&s;erves, that the
<PB N="538" REF="543">
farmers in that country divide lime into hot and mild; which
Mr. Tennant believes to mean magne&s;ian and calcareous lime.</P>
<P>By experiments which were made by Mr. Tennant by &s;owing
&s;eeds of colewort on various mixtures of calcined magne&s;ia
with &s;oil, and of calcareous lime with &s;oil, he found that thirty
or forty grains of lime did not retard the growth of &s;eeds more
than three or four of calcined magne&s;ia; from hence what can
we conclude? but that, as they both injure vegetation in large
quantities, they may both a&s;&s;i&s;t vegetation in &s;mall ones? and
that this is more probable, as the farmers believe, that they find
both of them u&s;eful, though in different quantities; and as the
magne&s;ia would form Ep&s;om &s;alt, if it meets with vitriolic acid,
which Dr. Home found from his experiments to be friendly to
vegetation, when u&s;ed in very &s;mall quantities. More accurate
ob&s;ervations and more numerous experiments on this &s;ubject are
required, which this important di&s;covery of Mr. Tennant's will
I hope &s;oon occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>Another method has been attempted by &s;ome for the purpo&s;e
of ameliorating clayey lands, which were unfit to be turned up
deeper than they had been accu&s;tomed to be ploughed, on account
of their acidity or tenacity being very injurious to vegetation; as
the white &s;aggar clays over many coal countries; or &s;ome very
tenacious red clays, which may contain a vitriol of iron; not an
oxyde, or oxygenated calx of it.</P>
<P>The method I allude to con&s;i&s;ts in fir&s;t turning over a ridge of
earth, as in common ploughing; and then with a plough, made
on purpo&s;e, to penetrate &s;ome inches deeper into the clay &s;o inju|rious
to vegetation; this plough is to be &s;o contrived, as to rai&s;e
up the clayey &s;oil about the breadth of the furrow recently made,
and three or four inches deep, or more; but not to turn it over,
&s;o that it may &s;till lie under the fertile &s;oil, which is to be turned
over it with the common plough, in making the adjoining fur|row.
So that this plough is only to pa&s;s under the &s;oil, and
<PB N="539" REF="544">
thus loo&s;en it, and mix it with atmo&s;pheric air without turning
it over.</P>
<P>By this manoeuvre the clay a few inches deep beneath the fer|tile
&s;oil becomes broken in its texture, and obtains &s;ome air inter|cepted
in its pores; from the former circum&s;tance it may contri|bute
to retain the vernal &s;howers, which would otherwi&s;e run off
over the clayey &s;urface beneath the more fertile one, and might
thus in drier &s;ea&s;ons prevent the upper &s;urface from being &s;o much
indurated, and might gradually become le&s;s injurious by the fre|quent
admixture of atmo&s;pheric air, and at length even &s;alubrious
to the roots of vegetables.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t experiment I tried to improve this valuable
machine was that mentioned in Sect. XII. 5. of this work,
by enlarging the axis of Mr. Tull's &s;eed-box into a wheel
of &s;ixteen inches diameter, with excavations in the rim
to rai&s;e portions of the corn above the &s;urface of that in
the &s;eed-box. But I found to my &s;urpri&s;e the friction of
the corn to be &s;o much greater than expected, when &s;ix
&s;uch large wheels were immer&s;ed in it, that an additional
hopper became nece&s;&s;ary to deliver the &s;eed &s;lowly into the

would add much to the intricacy and expence of the ma|chinery,

<P><HI>b b</HI> are the horns or &s;hafts behind, for the per&s;on who

nine inches from each other, and the &s;ix dark &s;quare holes
are placed &s;even inches from each other to receive the

<HEAD>Con&s;truction of the &s;eed-box. Plate XI. Fig. 2.</HEAD>
<P>This con&s;i&s;ts of boards about an inch in thickne&s;s, is
forty-eight inches long within, twelve inches deep, twelve
inches wide at top, and &s;ix inches wide at bottom; it is
divided into &s;ix cells, in which the corn is to be put, as
repre&s;ented in Plate XI. Fig. 2. and &s;hould al&s;o have a
cover with hinges to keep out the rain, and is to be placed
in part over, and in part before, the axle-tree of the car|riage,
at <HI>g g.</HI> Plate X. Fig. 1.</P>
<P>Beneath the bottom of the &s;eed-box pa&s;&s;es a wooden
cylinder, at <HI>h h,</HI> Plate XI. Fig. 2. with excavations in its
periphery to receive the grain from the &s;ix cells of the
&s;eed-box, <HI>l m n o p q,</HI> and to deliver it into the &s;ix oblique
flues <HI>i i,</HI> which are made of tin, and cro&s;s each other, as
repre&s;ented in the plate. The u&s;e of the &s;eed-flues thus
inter&s;ecting each other is to increa&s;e the length of the in|clined
&s;urface, on which the &s;eed de&s;cends, that if &s;ix or
eight grains be delivered together, they might &s;o &s;eparate
by their friction in de&s;cending, as not to be &s;own together
in one point, which might be liable to produce tu&s;&s;ocks of
corn.</P>
<P>As the&s;e &s;eed-flues cro&s;s each other, before they pa&s;s
through the coulter-beam at <HI>c c,</HI> Plate X. Fig. 1. it was
nece&s;&s;ary to make three of the round holes of the coulter-beam
<PB N="544" REF="548">
at one end backwarder than tho&s;e at the other end;
and on that account to u&s;e iron &s;taples or rings at one end
in&s;tead of perforations, as at <HI>w w,</HI> Plate X. Fig. 1.
The&s;e tin flues deliver the &s;eed at the time of &s;owing into
the &s;mall furrows or drills, which are made by the coulters
before them.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;eed-flues have a joint at <HI>z z,</HI> where one part of
the tin tubes &s;lides into the other part, and they by the&s;e
means can be occa&s;ionally &s;hortened or lengthened to ac|commodate
them to the coulters, when placed at &s;even
inches di&s;tance for &s;owing barley, or at nine for &s;owing
wheat.</P>
<P>At the bottom of this &s;eed-box are &s;ix holes, one in each
cell, to deliver the corn into the excavations of the cylin|der,
which revolves beneath them. The&s;e holes are fur|ni&s;hed
on the de&s;cending &s;ide, as the cylinder revolves,
with a &s;trong bru&s;h of bri&s;tles about three fourths of an
inch long, which pre&s;s hard on the tin cylinder. On the
a&s;cending &s;ide of the revolving cylinder the holes at the
bottom of the &s;eed-box are furni&s;hed with a piece of
&s;trong &s;hoe-&s;oal leather, which rubs upon the a&s;cending
&s;ide of the cylinder. By the&s;e means the corn, whether
beans or wheat, is nicely delivered, as the axis revolves,
without any of them being cut or brui&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>Con&s;truction of the iron axis and wooden cylinder beneath the &s;eed-box. Plats XI. Fig. 3.</HEAD>
<P>An iron bar is fir&s;t made about four feet &s;ix inches in
length, and an inch &s;quare, which ought to weigh about
fifteen pounds; this bar is covered with wood, &s;o as to
make a cylinder four feet long, and two inches in diame|ter,
as at <HI>k k,</HI> Plate XI. Fig. 3. The u&s;e of the iron bar
in the centre of the wood is to prevent it from warping,
which is a matter of great con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="545" REF="549">
This wooden cylinder pa&s;&s;es beneath the bottom of the
&s;eed-box, and has a ca&s;t-iron cog-wheel at one end of its
axis, as at <HI>r r,</HI> which is one fourth of the diameter of
the correspondent ca&s;t-iron wheel, which is fixed on the
nave of the carriage-wheel, as in Plate X. Fig. 1. <HI>f f,</HI> &s;o
that the axis of the &s;eed-box revolves four times during
every revolution of the wheels of the carriage.</P>
<P>In the periphery of this wooden cylinder are excavated
four lines of holes, &s;ix in each line, as at <HI>n n n n n n.</HI> A
&s;econd line of excavations is made oppo&s;ite to the&s;e on the
other &s;ide of the cylinde$, and two other lines of exca|vations
between the&s;e; $o that there are in all twenty-four
excavations in the wooden part of this axis beneath the
&s;eed-box, which excavations receive the corn from the
&s;eed-cells, as the axis revolves, and deliver it into the
flues &s;hewn in Plate XI. Fig. 2. <HI>o o i i,</HI> not un&s;imilar to
the original de&s;ign of the ingenious Mr. Tull.</P>
<P>The &s;ize of the&s;e excavations in the wooden cylinder to
receive the &s;eed are an inch long, half an inch wide, and
three eighths of an inch deep; which are too large for
any &s;eeds at pre&s;ent employed in large quantities, except
beans, but have a method to contract them to any dimen|&s;ions
required, by moving the tin cylinder over the wooden
one, as explained below in Plate XI. Fig. 4.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Con&s;truction of the Tin-cylinder. Plate XI.</HEAD>
<P>A B at Fig. 4. repre&s;ents a cylinder of tin an inch
longer within than the wooden cylinder on the iron axis at
Fig. 3. and is of two inches diameter within, &s;o as exactly
to receive the wooden cylinder, which may &s;lide about an
inch backwards or forwards within it. C D are two
&s;quare tin &s;ockets fixed on the ends of the tin cylinder to
fit on the &s;quare part of the iron axis, which, pa&s;&s;es
through the wooden cylinder at <HI>l l,</HI> Fig. 3. on which they
&s;lide one inch backwards or forwards.</P>
<P><PB N="546" REF="550">
The following directions in making the holes in this tin
cylinder, and tho&s;e in the wooden cylinder, which are to
corre&s;pond with them, mu&s;t be nicely attended to.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> when the tin-cylinder is &s;oldered longitudinally,
and one end of it &s;oldered on, as at A, &s;ix holes through
it mu&s;t be made longitudinally on four oppo&s;ite &s;ides of
it, each hole mu&s;t be exactly half an inch wide, and five
eighths of an inch long, the length to be parallel to
the length of the cylinder.</P>
<P>The centre of the fir&s;t of the&s;e holes mu&s;t be five inches
di&s;tant from the clo&s;ed end A, the centre of the &s;econd
hole mu&s;t be eight inches di&s;tant from the centre of the
fir&s;t, and &s;o on till &s;ix holes are made longitudinally along
the cylinder. Then another &s;uch line of &s;ix &s;imilar holes
is to be made on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the cylinder, and
then two other &s;uch lines between the former, in all
twenty-four; and the &s;ize of all the&s;e holes mu&s;t be nicely
ob&s;erved, as well as their di&s;tances.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The wooden cylinder fixed on the axis is now
to be introduced into the tin cylinder, but not quite to the
end of it, but &s;o as to leave exactly one inch of void &s;pace
at the clo&s;ed end A, and then the &s;ize of all the&s;e aper|tures
through the tin cylinder, each of which is exactly
half an inch wide, and five eighths of an inch long, are
to be nicely marked with a fine point on the wooden cy|linder,
which mu&s;t not previou&s;ly have any excavations
made in it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The twenty-four holes thus marked on the
wooden cylinder are now to be excavated exactly three
eighths of an inch deep, but with an addition al&s;o of three
eighths of an inch at that end of every one of them which
is next to A, &s;o that, when the wooden cylinder is again
replaced in the tin cylinder as before, with one inch of
void &s;pace at the clo&s;ed extremity of it, the excavations
in the wooden cylinder will be three eighths of an inch
<PB N="547" REF="551">
longer, than the perforations in the tin cylinder over them.
The&s;e excavations in the wooden cylinder mu&s;t al&s;o be
rather narrower at the bottom than at the top, to prevent
with certainty any of the grain from &s;ticking in them, as
they revolve.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> A &s;crew of iron about three inches long,
with a &s;quare head to receive a &s;crew-driver, is to pa&s;s
through the end A of the tin cylinder on one &s;ide of the
axis, as at <HI>x,</HI> Fig. 4. The &s;crew part of this is to lie in
a hollow groove of the wooden cylinder, and to be re|ceived
into a nut, or female &s;crew, which is fixed to the
wooden cylinder. The head part of the &s;crew, which
pa&s;&s;es through the end A of the tin cylinder at <HI>x,</HI> mu&s;t
have a &s;houlder within the tin cylinder, that it may not
come forwards through the end of it; and a bra&s;s ring
mu&s;t be put over the &s;quare end of the &s;crew on the out|&s;ide
of the tin cylinder, with a pin through that &s;quare
end of the &s;crew to hold on the bra&s;s ring.</P>
<P>Thus when the &s;quare head of the &s;crew is turned by
a &s;crew-driver, it gradually moves the tin cylinder back|wards
and forwards one inch on the wooden one, &s;o as
either to pre&s;s the end A of the tin cylinder into contact
with the end of the wooden cylinder within it, or to re|move
it to the di&s;tance of one inch from it, and leave a
void &s;pace at the end A.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> The ends of all the holes of the tin cylinder,
which are next to the end A of it, are now to be enlarged,
by &s;litting the tin three eighths of an inch towards A, on
each &s;ide of the hole; and then that part of the tin, in|cluded
between the&s;e two &s;lits, which will be half an
inch wide, and three eighths of an inch lengthways in
re&s;pect to the cylinder, is not to be cut out, but to be bent
down into the excavations of the wooden cylinder beneath,
&s;o as to lie again&s;t that end of the excavation which is
next to A.</P>
<P><PB N="548" REF="552">
But the&s;e projecting bits of tin, before they are bent
down into the excavations of the wooden cylinder, mu&s;t
be filed a little le&s;s at the projecting end, which is to be
bent down, than at the other end; as the excavations of
the wooden cylinder are to be rather narrower at the bot|tom
than at the top, and the&s;e pieces of tin, when bent
down, mu&s;t exactly fit them.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly.</HI> When all the&s;e holes through the tin-cylinder
are thus enlarged, and the bits of tin filed rather narrower
at their projecting ends, and then bent down into the ex|cavations
of the wooden cylinder, the other end of the
tin cylinder with its &s;quare &s;ocket may be &s;oldered on.</P>
<P>And now when the end of the tin cylinder at A is
pre&s;&s;ed forwards upon the wooden cylinder towards B,
by turning the &s;crew at <HI>x</HI> above de&s;cribed; every exca|vation
of the wooden cylinder will be gradually le&s;&s;ened,
and finally quite clo&s;ed; by which ea&s;y means they may
be adapted to receive and deliver &s;eeds of any &s;ize from
hor&s;e-beans and peas to wheat, barley, and to turnip-&s;eed,
with the greate&s;t accuracy, &s;o as to &s;ow four, five, or &s;ix
pecks on an acre, or more or le&s;s, as the agricultor plea&s;es,
by only turning the &s;crew a few revolutions one way or
the other.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations.</HEAD>
<P>1. In the con&s;truction of the tin and wooden cylinders
beneath the &s;eed-box another &s;mall improvement may be
nece&s;&s;ary in &s;owing very &s;mall &s;eeds, which is this: As
the &s;crew at the end A is turned, &s;o as to contract all the
excavations of the wooden cylinder, the &s;urface of the
wooden cylinder for one inch from the end of each exca|vation
towards the end B, Plate XI. Fig. 4. will become
bare without being covered by the tin cylinder; and on
the&s;e bare parts of the wooden cylinder, which will be
one inch long, and half an inch wide, &s;ome &s;mall &s;eeds
<PB N="549" REF="553">
may chance to &s;tick, and evade the bru&s;hes, which &s;hould
prevent them from pa&s;&s;ing, as the cylinders revolve.</P>
<P>To prevent this, when the wooden cylinder is &s;o placed
within the tin cylinder, that all the holes are quite open,
let a piece of the tin cylinder about an inch and a half
long, and half an inch wide, be cut out from the extre|mity
of each hole next to the end B, and let this piece of
the tin cylinder thus cut out be fixed by a few &s;prigs on
the wooden cylinder exactly in the &s;ame place, which it
covered before it was cut out of the tin one, by which
contrivance, when the tin cylinder is afterwards pu&s;hed
forwards by turning the &s;crew at its end, &s;o as to contract
the excavations of the wooden cylinder beneath, the bare
parts of the wooden cylinder will exi&s;t an inch and a half
from the extremities of the excavations next to the end
B, and thus will not pa&s;s under the bru&s;hes, and in con|&s;equence
no &s;mall &s;eeds can lodge in them.</P>
<P>2. Some kind of iron &s;taple &s;hould be fixed at each end
of the &s;eed-box on the out&s;ide, which when the hinder
part of the carriage is rai&s;ed up by the per&s;on who guides
it, might catch hold of the two iron &s;prings at <HI>d d</HI> in Plate
X. Fig. 1. for the purpo&s;e of &s;u&s;pending the coulters out
of the ground, and connecting the hinder part of the
machine with the &s;hafts before; that in turning at the
ends of the lands, or in pa&s;&s;ing from or to the field, the
wheels may not &s;werve at the joint <HI>z,</HI> at the centre of the
axle-tree, but may follow in the &s;ame line with the &s;hafts.</P>
<P>3. The &s;eed-box mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;upported on upright iron
pins pa&s;&s;ing through iron &s;taples, with a lever under the
end of it next to the wheel <HI>r r,</HI> Plate XI. Fig. 3, for the
purpo&s;e of ea&s;ily lifting that end of the &s;eed-box about
an inch high, to rai&s;e the teeth of the iron cog-wheel on
its axis out of the teeth of the corre&s;pondent iron wheel
on the nave of the carriage-wheel.</P>
<P>4. The con&s;truction of the coulters, which make the
drills, and of the rakes, which again fill them, after the
<PB N="550" REF="554">
&s;eed is depo&s;ited, and al&s;o of the hoes, are not here deli|neated;
as they are &s;imilar to tho&s;e &s;o often de&s;cribed or
u&s;ed by Mr. Tull and his followers.</P>
<P>5. When the lower ends of the &s;eed-flues are placed
through the holes in the coulter-beam, Plate. I. Fig. 1.
at nine inches di&s;tance from each other, the rows of wheat
or beans will then be &s;own nine inches from each other;
and as the wheels of the carriage are four feet in diame|ter,
and therefore travel about twelve feet at each revo|lution;
and as there are four excavations round the axis
of the &s;eed-box, which revolve four times for one revo|lution
of the carriage-wheels; it follows, that the &s;eeds
contained in the excavations of the cylinder beneath the
&s;eed-box will be &s;own at nine inches di&s;tance in each drill
or furrow, as the plough proceeds; and as the&s;e rows
are nine inches a&s;under, any de&s;ired number of &s;eeds may
be depo&s;ited in every &s;quare of nine inches, which are contained in the &s;urface of the field.</P>
<P>6. Mr. Coke of Norfolk acquainted me, that on his
very exten&s;ive farm the wheat &s;own on an acre was &s;ix or
&s;even pecks by the Rev. Mr. Cook's drill plough, which
was about half the quantity generally u&s;ed in broad-ca&s;t
&s;owing. If the wheat was nicely depo&s;ited in the drills,
I &s;u&s;pect one bu&s;hel would be quite &s;ufficient for an acre,
as the rows are at nine inches di&s;tant from each other; for
there would in that ca&s;e be about eight grains or nine grains
depo&s;ited in every nine inches of the drill-furrow; that
is, in every &s;quare of nine inches contained in the &s;urface
of the land &s;o cultivated.</P>
<P>Which may be thus e&s;timated. Mr. Charles Miller, in
the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, Vol. LVIII. p. 203, has
e&s;timated the number of grains in a bu&s;hel of wheat to
amount to 620,000; and Mr. Swanwick of Derby has
lately e&s;timated them to be 645,000. We may &s;uppo&s;e
therefore, that a bu&s;hel may at an average contain 635,000
<PB N="551" REF="555">
grains of wheat. Now as a &s;tatute acre contains 4840
&s;quare yards, and there are &s;ixteen &s;quares of nine inches
in every &s;quare yard, 4840 multiplied by 16 gives 77,440,
which is the number of &s;quares of nine inches in &s;uch an
acre. If 635,000 grains in a bu&s;hel be divided by 77,440,
the number of &s;quares of nine inches in an acre, the quo|tient
will &s;hew, that rather more than eight grains of
wheat will thus be depo&s;ited in every nine inches of the
drills.</P>
<P>7. Now if eight or nine grains were dropped altogether
in one inch of ground, they would be too numerous, if
they be all &s;uppo&s;ed to grow, and would form a tu&s;&s;ock;
but by making them &s;lide down an inclined plane, as in
the tin-flues, from the &s;eed-box to the coulters, which
are cro&s;&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of lengthening them, as &s;een
in Plate XI. fig. 2. &s;ome of the &s;eeds will be more de|layed
by their friction in de&s;cending than others, and the
eight or nine &s;eeds will thence be di&s;per&s;ed over the whole
nine inches of the drill; which renders drill-&s;owing &s;u|perior
to dibbling, as in the latter the &s;eeds are dropped
all together.</P>
<P>8. When the holes in the wooden cylinder are com|pletely
open, they are about a proper &s;ize for &s;owing
hor&s;e-beans or peas: when they are completely clo&s;ed,
there will remain a &s;mall niche at the end of the excava|tion
in the wooden cylinder next to B, Plate XI. fig. 4.
for turnip-&s;eed, or other &s;mall &s;eeds.</P>
<P>For wheat and barley and oats, a wooden wedge
&s;hould be made of the exact &s;hape of the area of the
hole, which the director of the plough requires; who
will occa&s;ionally in&s;ert it into the holes, when he turns
the &s;crew at the end of the cylinder to enlarge or to le&s;&s;en
them to the&s;e exact dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e wedges &s;hould be written upon with white paint,
wheat, barley, oats, &amp;c. which will much facilitate the
<PB N="552" REF="556">
adapting the &s;ize of the excavations to each kind of grain,
and may be altered, if required, to &s;uit larger or le&s;s &s;eeds
of the &s;ame denomination.</P>
<P>9. In &s;ome drill-ploughs, as in Mr. Cook's, there is an
additional machinery to mark a line, as the plough pro|ceeds,
in which the wheel neare&s;t the la&s;t &s;own furrow
may be directed to pa&s;s at a proper di&s;tance from it, and
parallel to it. But in &s;owing wheat or peas and beans this
may be done by making the wheels, as they run upon the
ground, to be exactly fifty-four inches from each other;
and then at the time of &s;owing to guide the wheel next to
the part la&s;t &s;own exactly in the rut, which was la&s;t made;
by which guide the rows will all of them be accurately
at nine inches di&s;tant from each other.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Simplicity of this Drill Plough.</HEAD>
<P>1. The &s;implicity of this machine con&s;i&s;ts fir&s;t in its
having only a &s;eed-box, and not both a hopper and a &s;eed-box,
as in the Rev. Mr. Cook's patent drill-plough.</P>
<P>2. The flues, which conduct the &s;eed from the bottom
of the &s;eed-box into the drill-furrows, are not disjoined
about the middle of them to permit the lower part to move

<HEAD>Mr. Swanwick's Seed-Box.</HEAD>
<P>As the dibbling of wheat, de&s;cribed in Sect. XVI. 2.
2. is a very &s;low and laborious method of depo&s;iting the
corn, and is yet coming, as I am informed, more and
more into fa&s;hion in &s;ome counties, I &s;u&s;pect this mu&s;t be
owing to the expence of procuring, and the difficulty of
managing the drill-ploughs now in u&s;e, or to the greater
inaccuracy, with which they deliver the &s;eed. I flatter
my&s;elf therefore, that I am doing a benefit to &s;ociety in
endeavouring to &s;implify this machine, and to increa&s;e its
accuracy as much as po&s;&s;ible: and &s;hall therefore here de|&s;cribe
another method of delivering the &s;eed from the
&s;eed-box, which was invented by Mr. Swanwick, an in|genious
teacher of writing and arithmetic, with &s;ome
branches of natural philo&s;ophy, in Derby; and who will
not be aver&s;e to &s;hew the working models of the &s;eed-boxes,
or to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to any one, who wi&s;hes to con|&s;truct
either this drill machine, or the preceding one.</P>
<P><PB N="554" REF="558">
Mr. Swanwick's &s;eed-box is forty-eight inches long
within, is divided into &s;ix cells for the purpo&s;e of &s;owing
&s;ix rows of &s;eeds at the &s;ame time, like that above de|&s;cribed.
And at the bottom of each cell is a hole, <HI>a, a,</HI> &amp;c.
Fig. 1. Plate XII. for the &s;eed to pa&s;s through into
the &s;eed-flues, as in the machine before de&s;cribed: but in
this there is no revolving axis, but a wooden or iron bar
B B, fig. 3. Plate XII. about two inches broad, and about
four feet eight inches long, and exactly three eighths of
an inch thick. Through this bar there are &s;ix perforations,
<HI>e e e,</HI> &amp;c. which are each of them exactly one inch long,
and half an inch wide; and three eighths of an inch
deep, which is the thickne&s;s of the bar. The centres of
the&s;e holes are exactly eight inches di&s;tant from each
other, corre&s;pondent to the holes at the bottom of the
&s;eed-box; over which it is made to &s;lide backward and
forwards in a groove. By this &s;liding motion it pa&s;&s;es
under &s;tiff bru&s;hes, which are placed over it on each end
of the holes at the bottom of the &s;eed-box, and &s;trickle
off the grain, as the holes in the &s;liding-bar pa&s;s under
them, which thus mea&s;ure out the quantity with con&s;ider|able
accuracy.</P>
<P>In order to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the quantity of grain
delivered, the &s;lider is covered with a ca&s;e of tin C C, fig.
4, Plate XII. which has &s;ix perforations exactly corre|&s;ponding
with the holes in the &s;lider; but in&s;tead of the
bit of tin being cut out the whole length of the hole, part
of it is left at the end <HI>i,</HI> fig. 6, equal to the thickne&s;s of
the &s;lider, and is bent down as at <HI>b,</HI> after the &s;lider is put
into the ca&s;e, like the tin cylinder in the preceding ma|chine.
This ca&s;e is moveable about one inch backward
and forward by turning the finger-&s;crew <HI>s,</HI> fig. 4 and 5;
and thus the holes are made larger or le&s;s to &s;uit various
&s;orts of grain, or different quantities of the &s;ame &s;ort,
exactly as in the wooden and tin cylinders in Plate XI.
<PB N="555" REF="559">
The &s;lider is moved forwards by a bent iron pin <HI>h</HI> attached
to it, which pa&s;&s;es into a &s;erpentine groove Y, fig. 5, fixed
to the nave of the wheel: and backwards by a &s;teel &s;pring
at the other end of the &s;eed-box, which is not repre&s;ented
in the plate.</P>
<P>Fig. 5 is a bird's eye view of the parts before de&s;cribed:
E E the &s;eed-box divided into cells by the partitions <HI>d d,</HI>
&amp;c.&mdash;<HI>c c c</HI> the &s;lider, with a part of the apertures &s;een ju&s;t
appearing from under the bru&s;hes. X the axis of the wheel.</P>
<P>Fig. 6 is a drawing of part of the tin ca&s;e, nearly
of the full dimen&s;ions as to breadth and thickne&s;s, but
only a &s;mall portion of the length; and is intended to
&s;hew more di&s;tinctly the con&s;truction of it.</P>
<P>Fig. 2 repre&s;ents a &s;ide-view of one of the &s;ix bridges
lying over the holes at the bottom of the &s;eed-box, on each
&s;ide of which the bru&s;hes are fixed, which &s;trickle the
holes, when they are full of corn, as the bar &s;lides back|wards
and forwards.</P>
<P>The &s;implicity of this &s;lider at the bottom of the &s;eed-box
may be in &s;ome re&s;pects greater, than that of wooden
and tin cylinders in the former machine; as this has but
&s;ix holes to mea&s;ure out the corn, and the other has
twenty-four. But perhaps in other re&s;pects le&s;s &s;o; as in
this twelve bru&s;hes are u&s;ed, one on each &s;ide of each of
the &s;ix holes; whereas there are only &s;ix bru&s;hes rub upon
the tin cylinder in the former machine. And the recipro|cating
motion of this &s;lider must be quick, as it mu&s;t act
once every time the periphery of the wheel of the car|riage
has pa&s;&s;ed nine inches forward; which may not be
&s;o ea&s;y to execute as the cog-wheel, and uninterrupted
movement of the axis and cylinder in the preceding ma|chine.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that the facility of adapting the
holes to the dimensions required in both the&s;e machines,
and their not brui&s;ing or breaking the grain in their ope|ration
<PB N="556" REF="560">
of delivering it, as well as their not being encum|bered
with an additional hopper, which mu&s;t deliver the
quantity of &s;eed with great inaccuracy from the unequal
&s;haking of the machine, adds much to the excellency and
&s;implicity of them both. And I hope will render more
general the u&s;e of the drill hu&s;bandry invented by the in|genious
Mr. TULL; who was on that account an honour
to this country, and ought to have a &s;tatue erected to his
memory, as a benefactor of mankind, like Ceres and
Triptolemus of old.</P>

<P>Is a &s;ection of a machine for rai&s;ing water a few feet high by the

watering lands on a higher level.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts of a windmill &s;ail placed horizontally like that of a
&s;moak-jack, &s;urrounded by an octagon tower; the diverging rays
of this tower, <HI>a b, a b,</HI> may con&s;i&s;t of two-inch deals only, if
on a &s;mall &s;cale, or of brick-work if on a larger one. The&s;e up|right
pillars are connected together by oblique horizontal boards
as &s;hewn at A B, by which boards placed horizontally from pil|lar
to pillar, in re&s;pect to their length, but at an angle of about
45 degrees in re&s;pect to their breadth, &s;o as to form a complete
octagon including the horizontal windmill &s;ail near the top of it;
the wind as it &s;trikes again&s;t any of them, from whatever quarter
it comes, is bent upwards and then &s;trikes again&s;t the horizontal
wind-&s;ail. The&s;e horizontal boards, which form the &s;ides of the
octagon, may either be fixed in their &s;ituations, or be made to
turn upon an axis a little below their centres of gravity, &s;o as to
clo&s;e them&s;elves on that &s;ide of the octagon tower mo&s;t di&s;tant
from the wind.</P>
<P>It may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the wind thus reflected would lo&s;e
con&s;iderably of its power before it &s;trikes on the wind-&s;ail, but
on fixing a model of &s;uch a machine on the arm of a long whirl|ing
lever, with proper machinery to count the revolution of the
wind-&s;ail, when thus included in a tower and moving horizontally;
and then $he$ moved vertically as it was whirled on the arm of
the lever with the &s;ame velocity, it was found on many trials by
Mr. Edgeworth of Edgeworth town in Ireland, and by my&s;elf,
thus the wind by being thus reverted upwards by a fixed planed
board did not &s;eem to lo&s;e any of its power. And as the height
of the tower may be made twice as great as the diameter of the
&s;ail there is rea&s;on to conclude that the power of this horizontal
wind-&s;ail may be con&s;iderably greater, than if the &s;ame &s;ail was
placed nearly vertically oppo&s;ed to the wind in the u&s;ual manner.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the &s;haft of the wind-&s;ail is placed a centri|f$gal

or cylinder of lead, with two oppo&s;ite arms with an adapted valve
at the bottom to prevent the return of the water, and a valve at
the extremity of each arm to prevent any ingre&s;s of air above the

of the in&s;ulated wire F F touching H H. The longer end of
F is bent &s;o as not to touch the wire of B, till the end is brought
to it. Thus the po&s;itive electricity of A is increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>The wires are curled into &s;everal rings to make them more
ela&s;tic, as otherwi&s;e they would &s;oon be pu&s;hed out of their
places, and the proper contacts not occur. The plates A and B
may be fixed on heavy pede&s;tals, that they may be moved upon a
&s;helf to a proper di&s;tance from the plate, which hangs by the pen|dulum
wire. The heavier the pendulum and the larger the plates,
the more electricity may be accumulated. With my &s;mall appara|tus
fixed to a Dutch wooden clock &s;parks are &s;ometimes produced
between the plates, and &s;ometimes the clock has been &s;topped
by their attraction to each other. Perhaps the plates &s;hould not
be circular, but &s;omething like a lady's fan, when expanded, the
bottom being a part of the curve de&s;cribed by the moving pendu|lum,
with the &s;ides directed towards the point on which it moves.</P>
<P>This drawing and de&s;cription of his Pendulum Doubler was
&s;ent me by Mr. Bennet of Wirk&s;worth, and is referred to at the
end of Sect. XIII. of this work. If another in&s;ulated flower-pot
was connected with the plate B in&s;tead of the wire at the up|permo&s;t
H, perhaps it might be kept in a &s;tate of minus, or nega|tive
electricity, at the &s;ame time that the other flower-pot was
kept in a &s;tate of plus or po&s;itive electricity.</P>

<Q>Exhibits the aphis, puceron, or vine-fretter, and the in&s;ects
which de&s;troy it.</Q>
<P>Fig. 1. repre&s;ents the aphis of the ro&s;e-tree without wings
very much magnified, copied from M. Bonnet, with its antenae
before, and its two horns behind, which are not half the length
of the antennae, are immoveable, and &s;aid by Bonnet to be hol|low
canals from which the &s;weet juice called honey-dew is eva|cuated;
la&s;tly, with the trunk under its $ead in the po&s;ition in
which it penetrates the leaves. In &s;ome the horns behind are
wanting, and little knobs &s;upply their place, which Reaumur
thinks &s;upply the &s;ame &s;weet juice. That &s;ome po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing wings,
and others not, does not di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;exes is agreed by all ob|&s;ervers.</P>
<P>Fig. 2. repre&s;ents a magnified aphis of a pear-tree from which
a young one is &s;u&s;pended for &s;ome time after it is otherwi&s;e born.</P>
<P>Fig. 3. repre&s;ents the aphidivorous larva, with an aphis in its
mouth, and the chry&s;alis of the &s;ame in&s;ect, before it is trans|formed
into the fly at fig. 4. All the&s;e were drawn from nature,
and exactly re&s;emble &s;imilar repre&s;entations in the work of
Bonnet.</P>
<P>Fig. 5. repre&s;ents an in&s;ect from Bonnet, which he terms an
aphis lion, as it &s;o greedily devou$&s; the aphi&s;es. This in&s;ect is
transformed into the fly at fig. 6.</P>
<P>Fig. 7. repre&s;ents a &s;potted hemi&s;pheric &s;carabeus, called by
&s;ome a lady-bird, into which the in&s;ect at fig. 8. is transformed,
which is al&s;o &s;aid to be a great aphis-eater. Oeuvres de C.
