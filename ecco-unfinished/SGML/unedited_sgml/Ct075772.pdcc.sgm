<P>ONE of the rea&s;ons at lea&s;t, that induced the Author of <HI>Anticipation</HI> to publi&s;h his pamphlet la&s;t year, has equally prevailed with the Author of the pre&s;ent piece;&mdash; the wi&s;h to get money.&mdash;Gentlemen who &s;cribble for the pre&s;s may profe&s;s what they will; but, in the genuine &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, they <Q>hunger and &startq;&endq;thir&s;t,</Q> if not "after righteou&s;ne&s;s," at lea&s;t for a dinner.&mdash;The &s;hutting the galleries of the Hou&s;e of Commons was urged as a rea&s;on for la&s;t year's publication, and it prevails, in its full
<PB N="vi" REF="3">force, for that of the pre&s;ent. The cu&s;tom is indi&s;putably ab&s;urd; but when Members will &s;hut their Hou&s;e again&s;t their con&s;tituents, as they do their ears again&s;t their complaints, it becomes the duty of a real friend to his Country to <HI>anticipate</HI> the injury, and <HI>fore&s;tall the market,</HI> that the <HI>Em|ployers</HI> and the <HI>be&s;t Cu&s;tomers</HI> may be <HI>properly &s;erved.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen of political curio&s;ity, the mo&s;t in&s;atiate of all pa&s;&s;ions, will have rea&s;on to thank us for telling them what is to happen in the great council of the Nation, at lea&s;t five days before it can have happened. Five days are an age in the Idea of a Politician!&mdash;This is a &s;pecies of pro|phecy not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, and many Members of the Hou&s;e will thank us for putting words into their mouths.
<PB N="vii" REF="4">Many a good &s;peech would have been lo&s;t to the world but for this publi|cation.</P>
<P>About three years ago complaint was made, by a Member, of the publi|cation of &s;peeches in the News-papers; but he was well an&s;wered by another. <Q>&startq;Let us not complain; we are under obligation; the Gentlemen who write for the News-papers make better &s;peeches for us than we can &endq;make for our&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>It may be wondered that Mr. Al-d-n T&mdash;n&s;&mdash;d makes his appearance in this pamphlet; but let it be remembered that he is fond of oppo&s;ing his old ac|quaintance the City Patriot, and that he will force him&s;elf in <HI>any where</HI> to do him a mi&s;chief.</P>
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
<P>The Writer of the&s;e proceedings has nothing farther to &s;ay, but that he hopes the French and Spaniards will encourage the publication, by becom|ing large purcha&s;ers; of which he has the better hope, becau&s;e the hou&s;e of Bourbon has lately become the <HI>avowed protector of Liberty.</HI> They will have no difficulty in procuring as many co|pies as they plea&s;e to order:&mdash;they will be &s;afely conveyed in Dutch bottoms; and the Dutch are neutral to every thing but the getting money.</P>

<P>THE few introductory words to this piece, will, nece&s;&s;arily, be in &s;ub|&s;tance the &s;ame as tho&s;e prefixed to the ANTICIPATION of 1778, yet for form &s;ake, it will be proper to &s;tate the little cere|monies that preceded the more important bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the day.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t two o'clock, the gentleman u&s;her of the black rod was admitted into the H&mdash;e of C&mdash;ns, in con&s;equence of three raps which he gave at the door. Having made three bows on his advance towards the table, he informed the S&mdash;r, that his Maje&s;ty commanded the attendance of the Commons
<PB N="2" REF="7">in the H&mdash;e of Lords; on which the accu&s;|tomed crowd ru&s;hed forwards, eager to te&s;tify their loyalty where it was mo&s;t ju&s;tly due. We give the &s;ub&s;tance of the K&mdash;g's &s;peech, in compliment to the worthy members of admi|ni&s;tration who framed it; declining to publi&s;h the whole, not only as it might be deemed an affront to the augu&s;t per&s;onage who delivered it, but as it would be a kind of literary cruelty to rob the mini&s;ters of tho&s;e &s;trokes of elo|quence which are more peculiarly their own. &mdash;The Speech was to the following effect; &mdash;it &s;aid, that</P>
<Q><P>"The critical &s;ituation and uncommon emer|gency of public affairs, had induced his M&mdash;to a&s;&s;emble his parliament at &s;o early<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">N. B. The?&mdash;was not a&s;&s;embled earlier than u&s;ual.</NOTE> a &s;ea&s;on of the year, that they might have the more time to deli|berate on the weighty affairs that would call for their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>"That though the valour of his fleets had hi|therto been inadequate to the giving an effectual check to the in&s;olence of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, yet he did not doubt but that the period would &s;oon ar|rive,
<PB N="3" REF="8">when that event, &s;o much to be wi&s;hed for, would be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>"That though &s;ome of our We&s;t-India i&s;lands had been reduced, and others were threatened by the enemy, yet that he did not doubt, but that the former would be re-taken, and the latter effectually protected.</P>
<P>"That though the American war had been pro|tracted beyond the term that might have been rea|&s;onably expected, yet &s;uch &s;teps had been now taken, and &s;uch vigorous efforts would be u&s;ed, that there was little doubt but that another campaign would reduce the rebels to &s;uch a &s;ituation, that they would be glad to compromi&s;e the difference on &s;uch terms, as would be mutually advantageous to the mother country and her colonies.</P>
<P>"That the attempts of the Spaniards again&s;t Gibraltar had been hitherto fru&s;trated; that they could have little hope of &s;ucce&s;s, from the natural and artificial &s;trength of that fortre&s;s, and that they had not hitherto made, nor were likely to make, any attempt on the i&s;land of Minorca.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="9">
<P>"That he had received a&s;&s;urances of the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of his brother of Denmark, and had no doubt but that Ru&s;&s;ia and Pru&s;&s;ia would lend their aid in &s;upport of the common cau&s;e, if it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>"That our internal defence was greater than ever before known, all parties having united to &s;trengthen the hands of government, &s;o that public credit had not &s;uffered even at an apparent time of public danger.</P>
<P>"Neverthele&s;s, that he was as much as ever di&s;po&s;ed to put an end to the calamities of war, whenever &s;uch a de&s;irable event could be obtained in a manner con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of his crown, and the ju&s;t rights of his &s;ubjects, which it &s;hould be his care to pre&s;erve inviolate.</P>
<P>"That the proper officers &s;hould immediately lay before his faithful Commons the proper e&s;timates of the expences of the en&s;uing year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This part of the Speech is always faithfully com|plied with.</NOTE>; that he was greatly concerned that any additional burdens on the &s;ubject would be nece&s;&s;ary; but that his faithful Commons might be a&s;&s;ured, that his oeco|nomy
<PB N="5" REF="10">&s;hould be conducted on the mo&s;t rigid plan, and a proper application made of the money which might be voted; wherefore he had no doubt, but that they would make the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions for continuing the war, as the mo&s;t probable means of &s;ecuring a la&s;ting and honourable peace.</P>
<P>"The Speech ended with a full reliance on the wi&s;dom and unanimity of Parliament; and a pre|&s;age of what happy effects might be expected from the known abilities and conduct of his Admirals and Generals; the valour of his fleets and armies, and the fidelity and loyalty of his &s;ubjects in general."</P></Q>
<P>The C&mdash;ns having returned from the hou&s;e of L&mdash;ds, the &s;peech was read from the chair, in con&s;equence of which a junior member moved for an addre&s;s, and this was &s;econded by another of about equal &s;tanding in the hou&s;e. This addre&s;s, as u&s;ual, was de|&s;igned to echoe the &s;peech, &s;entence by &s;en|tence, and to expre&s;s the unanimity of the hou&s;e at a juncture &s;o critical, and its re&s;olu|tion to &s;upport the mea&s;ures of government. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to paint the affected he&s;ita|tion, the idle apologies, and pretended em|barra&s;&s;ments,
<PB N="6" REF="11">with which the&s;e &s;peeches were delivered; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay how much the public &s;ecurity, either in fact or in re|ality, was extolled.&mdash;The &s;pirit of the male-contents in America was daily declining&mdash;Ge|neral Clinton had obtained great and &s;ingular advantages&mdash;Our Fleet rode triumphant in the Channel, and our &s;eamen were in health and &s;pirits; while the Fleet of the enemy &s;ought &s;helter in harbour, and the men were dying by thou&s;ands:&mdash;the people were &s;ati&s;|fied, and a &s;pirit of contentment reigned through the kingdom; while nothing was wanting to give vigour to our efforts, but unanimity in the great council of the Kingdom.&mdash;We now proceed to give a &s;ketch of the debates which followed, on the propo&s;ed amendment to the addre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Lord J. C&mdash;v&mdash;d&mdash;&s;h.</HI> Sir, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion is generally deemed of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, and as &s;uch it ought to be treated. I wi&s;h my abilities were equal to the arduous ta&s;k I have taken in hand, of endeavouring to awake this hou&s;e to a &s;en&s;e of its own importance, that it might a&s;&s;ert its con&s;titutional right of controuling Mi|ni&s;ters,
<PB N="7" REF="12">by whom, generally &s;peaking, we our|&s;elves are controuled. Mini&s;ters, Sir, are as much accountable to this hou&s;e as any one of its Members is to his Con&s;tituents; and it is our duty to take care that they do not longer deceive and impo&s;e on the people, by blinding the eyes of the Sov&mdash;n. In former periods, however loudly we may exclaim again&s;t the corruption of tho&s;e times, no Mini&s;ter dared to have gone tho&s;e lengths which later Mini&s;|ters have done: no, Sir, his head mu&s;t have paid the forfeit of his mi&s;deeds; for there was then a &s;pirit, a vigour in this hou&s;e, which I tru&s;t is not yet altogether lo&s;t; I tru&s;t that &s;ome of that Patriotic blood which flowed in the veins of our Ance&s;tors, yet remains to warm and to animate their po&s;terity. I could wi&s;h that &s;ome other Gentleman had undertaken the ta&s;k that falls to my lot this day; but it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;omething &s;hould be done to rou&s;e the &s;leeping genius of this Country, and to unbind the eyes of one of the worthie&s;t, but the mo&s;t deceived, of mankind: and for the&s;e rea&s;ons I move that no part of the intended addre&s;s to the throne &s;hould be retained, but that which expre&s;&s;es our re&s;pect for his Ma|je&s;ty,
<PB N="8" REF="13">immediately after which I propo&s;e that the following words &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted:</P>
<Q><P>"Your faithful C&mdash;mm&mdash;ns, a&s;&s;ured of your M&mdash;y's warme&s;t wi&s;hes for the welfare of all your people, and your zealous endeavours to pro|mote the true honour and dignity of your Crown, &s;incerely condole with you on that unhappy &s;eries of inattention, blunder, and mi&s;management, which forebodes all kinds of evil to the former, and bids fair to tarni&s;h the &s;plendor of the latter. We have melancholy experience that the mo&s;t liberal grants that ever a confiding P&mdash;t gave to a beloved S&mdash;n have failed, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, to produce the &s;alutary effects for which they were given: Armies have been rai&s;ed, and Fleets equipped in vain: this Country is yet the deri&s;ion of its enemies, and the &s;corn of tho&s;e to whom it has been accu&s;tomed to give Law; &s;o that there can &s;carcely remain a doubt but that there has been great mi&s;management in the di&s;tribution of the pub|lic money, or that &s;uch orders have been given to our Commanders by Sea and Land, as have ren|dered their per&s;onal bravery, and profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill equally ineffectual.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="14">
<P>"Wherefore your M&mdash;y's mo&s;t faithful C&mdash;mm&mdash;ns, in real anxiety for your M&mdash;y's and the public welfare, humbly entreat your M&mdash;y to order the proper Officers to lay be|fore the Hou&s;e a faithful account of the expenditure of the public money for two years pa&s;t, particularly &s;o much of it as hath been i&s;&s;ued for the payment of our Fleets and Armies; and likewi&s;e that you will be plea&s;ed to order copies of the orders that have from time to time been given to our Comman|ders by Sea and Land, within the term abovemen|tioned, that your faithful C&mdash;mm&mdash;ns may be en|abled to form a proper judgment how the public money has been applied: and we promi&s;e your M&mdash;y every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our power in this im|portant cri&s;is of public affairs, and that we will exert our&s;elves to &s;upport and maintain the true honour and dignity of your Crown and King|doms."</P></Q>
<P>Having offered this amendment, Sir, to the con&s;ideration, and I hope to the concurrence, of the hou&s;e, I tru&s;t it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to expatiate on the good effects it mu&s;t have, if the requi&s;ition &s;hould be complied with. Par|liament will be well informed, the truth will be known, and we can either grant liberally,
<PB N="10" REF="15">or with-hold our grants, as we may be en|abled to judge, whether the public money will or will not be entru&s;ted in hands that are worthy to have the di&s;po&s;al of it. If we find that turpitude and venality which is too much to be feared, we can humbly &s;olicit the Throne for a removal of tho&s;e M&mdash;rs, to whom we <HI>know</HI> that this country is indebted for the principal &s;hare of tho&s;e calamities in which &s;he is involved.</P>
<P>This motion was &s;econded by Sir <HI>W&mdash;m M&mdash;r&mdash;dth,</HI> who &s;aid its importance was &s;o &s;elf-evident, that he hoped, what indeed he could not expect, that it would pa&s;s without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>R&mdash;gby</HI> objected to the whole of the amendment, but particularly that part of it which hinted at mi&s;management of the pub|lic money. I do not often trouble you, Mr. Speaker, nor will I be tedious now; but I am clearly of opinion, that no part of the public money is improperly applied, and I am &s;ure that a great proportion of it is laid out in the mo&s;t proper manner. The di&s;tribution of the money granted by parliament always has
<PB N="11" REF="16">been, and always ought to be, in the power of the mini&s;try:&mdash;they are the be&s;t judges how it ought to be di&s;po&s;ed of, and modern times, I believe, has not produced one in&s;tance of its mi&s;application; but certain &s;ums mu&s;t be laid out for certain purpo&s;es, which it is not proper the world &s;hould know; and ac|quainting this hou&s;e with its di&s;po&s;al, would be the &s;ame thing as telling it to the whole world; &s;ince whatever pa&s;&s;es here, is &s;ure to get abroad by means of the public prints; not without great &s;u&s;picion, that certain ho|nourable Gentlemen not only publi&s;h their own &s;peeches, but tho&s;e of others, as com|pletely as their memory can contain them; and the&s;e publications mu&s;t be highly prejudi|cial, as they acquaint our enemies with our proceedings almo&s;t as &s;oon as we know them our&s;elves. I have a Gentleman in my eye, who&s;e &s;peeches being always printed verba|tim, and generally within eighteen hours after they are delivered, no doubt can remain but that they are &s;ent to the printer <HI>before</HI> they are &s;poken.</P>
<P>This called up Mr. <HI>W&mdash;k&mdash;s;</HI> but the Hou&s;e inclining to hear Mr. <HI>R&mdash;gby</HI> to an end, the
<PB N="12" REF="17">former Gentleman re&s;umed his &s;eat, and then the latter proceeded as follows.&mdash;In general ca&s;es, I am no enemy to the liberty of the pre&s;s; but in this particular in&s;tance, it is more pernicious than its licentiou&s;ne&s;s. With regard to what I have &s;aid of money-matters, all the world mu&s;t know that it affects not my|&s;elf; give me a bottle, a boon companion, and a joke, and I am the happie&s;t fellow in his Maje&s;ty's dominions. For the rea&s;ons I have given, I di&s;&s;ent from the motion for the a|mendment, as totally improper, and calcu|lated to clog the wheels of government, and render ineffectual our endeavours for the pub|lic &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W&mdash;lk&mdash;s</HI> now ri&s;ing, the Hou&s;e was tolerably attentive, in expectation of a &s;pe|cimen of that wit of which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no incon&s;iderable &s;hare. He wondered why the honourable Gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t, &s;hould object to the amendment, and in particular to that part of it which hinted at an improper di&s;po&s;al of the public money, if he him&s;elf was totally innocent. It is not very common for tho&s;e to decline a &s;crutiny, who have no rea&s;on to dread the event of it. I would not
<PB N="13" REF="18">wi&s;h, Sir, any more than the honourable Gentleman, to take up time by a tedious ha|rangue; but his being clearly of opinion, that no part of the public money is mi&s;applied, does not alter my opinion, that almo&s;t every part of it is. I regard not the opinions or the a&s;&s;ertions of any man. The man is not yet born who is to frame my creed. [Here was a loud laugh.] I am naturally tenacious of giv|ing credit. The honourable Gentleman &s;ays, he is &s;ure a great proportion of the public mo|ney is laid out in the mo&s;t proper manner; if he means that part of it which is allotted to the payment of the forces, I deny that a &s;ingle &s;hilling is properly applied. We ought not to have any army at all. Our in&s;ular &s;ituation renders it totally unnece&s;&s;ary. Soldiers in an i&s;land (its militia excepted) is a contradiction in terms. I would allow his M&mdash;, and this only for parade &s;ake, half a dozen light hor&s;e, to gallop before him to Kew or to Wind&s;or; but not another &s;oldier would I have in the realm. Sailors are our natural defence; on their va|lour we may &s;afely depend; but the military are only the tools of arbitrary power, and the badge of &s;lavery; mere mercenaries, who prey on the public, to whom they cannot ren|der
<PB N="14" REF="19">one e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice. In ca&s;e of a civil war &s;oldiers might be nece&s;&s;ary; but heaven be prai&s;ed, that is not likely to happen; the pre&s;ent Sovereign &s;its enthroned in the hearts of his &s;ubjects. The parliament of Charles the I&s;t, found its u&s;e in the &s;oldiery; men then took up arms in behalf of freedom; the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven attended their endeavours, and they nobly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in bringing the tyrant to the block. I am &s;ure there is a noble Duke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">R&mdash;chm&mdash;d.</NOTE> in the other hou&s;e, who would thank me for this ob&s;ervation:&mdash;the de&s;cendant of a tyrant, he is the warme&s;t friend of freedom, and has had the virtue to avow that he rejoiced in the <HI>decollation.</HI> He knows and feels that <HI>Tyrannicides</HI> is the proper appellation of tho&s;e firm patriots, who, &s;oon after the Re&s;toration, were murdered under the name of <HI>Regicides.</HI> I would beg pardon for this digre&s;&s;ion; but it may be &s;ometimes proper to call back the at|tention of Gentlemen to tho&s;e periods which hath ble&s;&s;ed them even with the little of liberty they now enjoy. Gentlemen will &s;ay, that whatever may be the ca&s;e in general, we have a pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for &s;oldiers, to quell the in|&s;urgents, (I cannot call them by a har&s;her
<PB N="15" REF="20">name) in America. The Scotti&s;h phra&s;e for the&s;e brave oppo&s;ers of mini&s;terial tyranny is Rebels, which may not be improper in the North, for they be&s;t know what rebellion means. They have rebelled more than once, without the &s;lighte&s;t provocation, and the time does not &s;eem to be far di&s;tant when [Here the Orator was called to order; but re|&s;uming his di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid] I aver, that there could be no nece&s;&s;ity to have &s;ent troops to America, becau&s;e it could not be nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be any re&s;i&s;tance. The A|mericans &s;ought not war&mdash;they intreated, they petitioned, they remon&s;trated; but entreaty, petition, and remon&s;trance were equally vain. The Mini&s;try, who had driven them into the war, who&s;e &s;avage inhumanity compelled them to arms, turned a deaf ear to their com|plaints, and &s;purned tho&s;e whom they &s;hould have cheri&s;hed: at length their patience was exhau&s;ted, they found that the hearts of the Mini&s;try of this kingdom were <Q>hard as the &startq;&endq;nether mill-&s;tone.</Q> Then did they take a re&s;olution worthy them&s;elves, worthy the imi|tation of future ages: then did they lay the corner-&s;tone of that noble fabric, which, as it is the glory of the pre&s;ent, &s;hall be the won|der
<PB N="16" REF="21">of future times. The honourable Gentle|man who &s;poke la&s;t, has told us that he is no enemy to the liberty of the pre&s;s; I hope not, for it has been a friend to him: hundreds of his jokes and bon-mots have I read, which would have never &s;een the light, nor ever been re|peated beyond his own table, but for the hu|manity of the Printer of the Public Adver|ti&s;er, who kindly took in the Cubs, licked them into &s;hape, and &s;ent them into the world in a better dre&s;s than their Ma&s;ter could be|&s;tow on them. The Gentleman has hinted that my &s;peeches are printed verbatim. I avow, and boa&s;t of the fact. I have &s;ent many &s;peeches to the papers, and am of opi|nion that no Man ought to make a &s;peech that he would blu&s;h to read; or that would blu&s;h that all the World &s;hould read what he has &s;poken. I mention this as an an&s;wer to the honourable Gentleman's ob&s;ervation, that the publication of our &s;peeches is prejudicial, by acquainting our Enemies with ou$ proceed|ings. I believe not; I am afraid our Enemies have other friends within certain walls than [Here Mr. W&mdash;s was called to order; but being permitted to proceed, added] the Prin|ters of the public papers, few of whom are
<PB N="17" REF="22">courageous enough to tell the whole truth, and &s;ome of them &s;o pu&s;illanimous as to di&s;gui&s;e, and others &s;o ba&s;e as to fal&s;ify the fact. The Mini&s;try have <HI>their paper</HI> too; a paper open to the in&s;ertion of every thing that ought not to be read; and if a proper degree of virtue and public &s;pirit exi&s;ted in this Country, it would be a paper no longer; for it would not find a &s;ingle reader: yet &s;o tenacious am I of the li|berty of the Pre&s;s, that I would not &s;uppre&s;s even <HI>this</HI> publication, though I &s;hould be abu&s;ed in it every day, and I know it to be conducted by a Par&s;on, [an univer&s;al laugh.] I will not detain you longer, Sir, than while I give my hearty a&s;&s;ent to the propo&s;ed amendment, which I think calculated to afford &s;ome light to tho&s;e who have long <Q>&s;at in darkne&s;s, and &startq;&endq;in the &s;hadow of death.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Al&mdash;d&mdash;n T&mdash;d</HI> aro&s;e, chiefly to make one remark on a &s;entence that had fallen from the Gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t. He &s;ays he is naturally tenacious of giving credit: I wi&s;h he had been equally tenacious of <HI>taking</HI> it; it would have been much better, if not for him&s;elf, at lea&s;t for tho&s;e who were once his friends, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he was a
<PB N="18" REF="23">friend to his Country; but [Here Mr. T&mdash;d was called to order, and &s;at down, &s;couling under the penthou&s;e of his eyes, in his u&s;ual way when he is di&s;plea&s;ed; though when matters take a turn agreeable to his wi&s;hes, few men have a more ingenuous countenance.]</P>
<P><HI>Mr. W&mdash;l&mdash;e Ell&mdash;s</HI> objected to the amend|ment, as unnece&s;&s;ary, and not calculated to an&s;wer any one good purpo&s;e. He &s;aid that the laying papers before the hou&s;e tended only to create confu&s;ion when real bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be di&s;patched, and ob&s;erved, as he had done la&s;t year, that the Addre&s;s was little el&s;e than an echo of the &s;peech, and to be con&s;idered merely as a compliment to the S&mdash;v&mdash;r&mdash;n: there could therefore be no kind of harm in voting it as it u&s;ually had been voted, which indeed would infallibly be the ca&s;e if they &s;hould wrangle till the morning. [This &s;ort of rea&s;oning, though it might be founded in fact, did not &s;eem to have any weight with the Patriots, who thought it right to make one more &s;truggle for the declining liberties of their country. The lead was taken by the]</P>
<PB N="19" REF="24">
<P><HI>Hon. T. L&mdash;ll,</HI> who&s;e &s;peech was nearly in the following words: The &s;ilence of Mi|ni&s;ters on an occa&s;ion of this kind, &s;hall be no pattern for me; they are always &s;ilent when they ought to &s;peak, and generally &s;peak when they ought to be &s;ilent. I take up the Idea of the honourable Gentleman who &s;poke the la&s;t &s;ave two. He tells us, and he tells us truly, that <Q>Sailors are our natural defence; &startq;&endq;on their valour we may &s;afely depend.</Q> This is a truth, Sir, that ought to be written in letters of gold. I was abu&s;ed, traduced, calumniated, in a pamphlet publi&s;hed la&s;t year, entitled <HI>Anticipation,</HI> on account of my attachment to naval &s;ervice, my veneration for the wonderful mechani&s;m of a &s;hip; but my attachment to the &s;ervice is not abated, and, if po&s;&s;ible, my veneration for the art of Ship|building is increa&s;ed: the art of Navigation, indeed, has not been much improved or ho|noured of late. The &s;ailing from port to port on our own coa&s;t, the taking care to keep out of danger, the &s;lipping by the enemy in the night, and the timely coming to an anchor at Spithead or in Torbay, &s;eem now to comprize almo&s;t the whole of the naval art.&mdash;Some ex|ceptions, &s;ome glorious exceptions indeed,
<PB N="20" REF="25">have ari&s;en. A Farmer, a Pear&s;on, a Piercy have taught us what Engli&s;h Commanders &s;hould be; and a Keppel would have carried our naval triumph to the highe&s;t pitch, if the enemy had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;park of courage; or if there had been an utter impo&s;&s;ibility of our Admiral receiving in&s;tructions from a certain board; [Order! order!] I am to order, Sir; but what I have &s;aid relates not to this hou&s;e. There is a per&s;on whom the pamphlet I have alluded to calls <HI>Noah.</HI> I do not &s;ee much propriety in the compari&s;on between him and the Noah of antient days: what &s;imilarity there is will be be&s;t &s;een by a reference to an antiquated volume called the Bible, from which I &s;hall be the more free to quote, as I believe it is not much read but by a very few members of this a&s;&s;embly. The few among us who read Hebrew, may have &s;een in the Original what I &s;hall, in imitation of an ho|nourable Gentleman on this &s;ide of the hou&s;e, "tran&s;late for the Country Gentlemen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here Col. B&mdash;rr&eacute; knit his brows and looked fierce, for he al&s;o had been &s;neered at in the pamphlet of la&s;t year.</NOTE>" I could have read what I wi&s;h to quote in that tran&s;lation of the Bible now in u&s;e, but it was
<PB N="21" REF="26">made in the reign of the Pedant James the fir&s;t, and I have every thing that has a refer|ence to the hou&s;e of Stuart. We are told, Sir, in the hi&s;tory I refer to, that <Q>the Sons &startq;of God &s;aw the Daughters of Men, that they were fair; and they took them wives &endq;of all which they cho&s;e.</Q> That the Noah of this day has &s;een the beauty of the Daugh|ters of men, and that he has taken to him &s;uch as he cho&s;e, no Man will deny; but we are told farther, that <Q>every imagination of &startq;the thoughts of his heart was only evil con|tinually.&endq;</Q> In this in&s;tance, perhaps, the compari&s;on will hold good. <Q>But Noah found &startq;&endq;grace in the eyes of the Lord:</Q> Our mo|dern Noah, I believe, finds no grace in any eyes but tho&s;e of our &s;&mdash;v&mdash;r&mdash;n lord the K&mdash;g, and in tho&s;e of a few buffoons and fidlers. Noah was in&s;tructed in the art of Ship-build|ing, in con&s;equence of which he con&s;tructed the ark, which pre&s;erved him and his family from the violence of the flood. Hence, Sir, the origin of Ship-building, an art which I &s;o greatly admire. But what has this to do with the character of our modern Noah? He knows nothing of the art of Ship-building, and is more ignorant of navigation than a We&s;t-country
<PB N="22" REF="27">bargeman. "Noah begat three &s;ons." I &s;uppo&s;e our modern Noah has begotten three hundred:&mdash;but they are di&s;per&s;ed through the World, and, in the literal &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, they are the <HI>Filii Populi.</HI> <Q>The Lord &s;aid unto &startq;Noah, come thou, and all thy hou&s;e, into &endq;the Ark.</Q> I have heard preachers in my time that have been wonderfully fond of allegories. The&s;e Gentlemen would have compared the ark to a certain royal ho&s;pital, which has received great part of what may be deemed the <HI>hou&s;hold of Noah,</HI> and I have heard that it is in contemplation for the Scotch &s;urveyor and ar|chitect to build two additional wings, for the reception of all the voters of the county of Huntingdon. Noah was commanded to take into the ark, <Q>of every clean bea&s;t by &s;e|vens, &startq;and of bea&s;ts that were not clean by &endq;two, the male and his female.</Q> Has not the modern Noah rever&s;ed the obedience to this command, and given the preference to the <HI>unclean</HI> bea&s;ts? It would be as endle&s;s as fruitle&s;s to go on with quotations, and make the applications. In fact, the characters do not apply, and there was more of malice than of wit in the allu&s;ion, in the pamphlet I refer to. Noah's ark re&s;ted, in the &s;eventh month,
<PB N="23" REF="28">on the mountains of Ararat. Our ark, I fear, will not re&s;t in twice &s;even years. Noah &s;ent forth a raven and a dove. We have &s;ent forth a raven, which has gone croaking through the world:&mdash;the dove we have idly thought to re|tain, till &s;he has fled from us never to return. We cannot put forth our hands, and pull her into the ark. It is true that &s;he has offered the olive-branch of peace, which we madly rejected; and now has &s;he taken her eternal re&s;idence on the other &s;ide the Atlantic. Peace be with her, and with tho&s;e who hover under the &s;hadow of her wings! I was abu&s;ed la&s;t year, Sir, for quoting the examples of the an|cients as patterns for the moderns: I will not again tran&s;gre&s;s in that way, though I think we might have profited by the hints then giv|en; but I will &s;peak to a few facts, which have fallen immediately within my own know|ledge, or which I have received from the mo&s;t indubitable authority. Sir, a contagious &s;ickne&s;s is &s;aid to prevail among the fleet of the enemy; an equal contagion prevails among our own; and the rea&s;on of this is ob|vious: the &s;ame inactivity, the &s;ame pe&s;ti|lential air has infected both. The fleets were &s;o long in contact, without coming to an en|gagement,
<PB N="24" REF="29">that is no wonder if the contagion &s;hould &s;pread. Phy&s;icians and naturali&s;ts will tell us, Sir, that fire rarifies the air, and of con&s;equence promotes health. In this ca&s;e then a little gunpowder would have been u&s;e|ful; but this was re&s;erved to make &s;quibs and crackers for the boys of London and We&s;t|min&s;ter to throw about, to the terror and dan|ger of the inhabitants, on &s;ome night of re|joicing for nothing done, on the publication of &s;ome extraordinary Gazette; extraordinary only, as it &s;erves to publi&s;h the imbecillity of old England, and the treachery of her mini&s;|ters. &mdash;The &s;upplying our fleets with vege|tables, Sir, has been no better attended to this year than it was the la&s;t. I &s;ay nothing to the potatoes, becau&s;e I am convinced the &s;ea&s;on has been unfavourable to their vegetation, and becau&s;e I do not wi&s;h for a reply from the ho|nourable Gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. P&mdash;nton.</NOTE> who la&s;t year boa&s;ted that he had treated an augu&s;t per&s;onage with a &s;ample of the very potatoes of which I then complained. Allowing this to be fact, and I will never doubt the a&s;&s;ertion of any honour|able Gentleman, what does it amount to? Are K&mdash;gs the mo&s;t compleat judges of pota|toes,
<PB N="25" REF="30">and is the r&mdash;l ta&s;te <HI>never</HI> perverted? Let any of the Mini&s;try an&s;wer in the affirmative if they dare.&mdash;But &s;till, Sir, the par&s;nips, the turnips, and the carrots, are as putrid, as tough, and as dry as they then were; nor are they &s;upplied at the be&s;t hand; but pur|cha&s;ed, as the &s;our-crout for America was &s;ome years &s;ince, at ten times more than they are worth. A worthy friend of mine, a dealer in vegetables in Covent-Garden market, has a&s;&s;ured me, that he could furni&s;h govern|ment infinitely cheaper than the pre&s;ent price. Even in the articles of vegetables, Sir, the French have the advantage of us; for by late advices it appears, that they hang them on the out&s;ides of their &s;hips, which an&s;wers the double purpo&s;e of keeping them fre&s;h, and of repelling the guns of the enemy in ca&s;e of an engagement. This ought to furni&s;h a hint for us&mdash;<HI>Ab ho&s;te doceri.</HI> Let us too garni&s;h the &s;ides of our ve&s;&s;els with vegetables, or rather let us hang them in the rigging, (for it is at <HI>that</HI> the French fire) and defy the a&s;&s;ault of the foe. I am aware, that the &s;hip in which the young Prince &s;ails, will not be ill &s;upplied with the produce of the vegetable world; but, Sir, other people are to have their health con|&s;ulted
<PB N="26" REF="31">as well as princes; and I cannot &s;ee any rea&s;on that a man of &s;uperior rank &s;hould be kept in health, while the hone&s;t tar is eaten up with the &s;curvy. But I decline &s;aying any more on the &s;ubject, as our fleets have not late|ly kept long enough at &s;ea to dread much from the attacks of that fatal di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;Sir, I have nothing more to &s;ay, but that I &s;hall give my vote for the amendment, as one probable means of bringing the Mini&s;try, if not to a &s;en&s;e of their errors, (of which I de&s;pair) at lea&s;t to the puni&s;hment due to their crimes.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P&mdash;nt&mdash;n</HI> &s;aid, That he did not often trouble the Hou&s;e, but mu&s;t beg its indulgence for a few moments, not in reply to the honour|able Gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t, (for it would be idle to think of replying to a man who had &s;aid a great deal about nothing) but in regard to the article of potatoes, of which he had really and <HI>bona fide</HI> had the honour to treat an illu&s;trious per&s;onage, who&s;e predilection in fa|vour of potatoes was &s;o well known, that from the time of a late royal demi&s;e to his mar|riage, the&s;e vegetables had furni&s;hed his con|&s;tant &s;upper; a proof of that oeconomy and
<PB N="27" REF="32">moderation which had di&s;tingui&s;hed his future life.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>T. T&mdash;n&s;&mdash;d</HI> expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the following terms. I am a&s;toni&s;hed, Sir, that any honourable gentleman can talk of pota|toes, when the weal of an empire is at &s;take. It is of little importance to us how we are fed, when the doubt is, whether we &s;hall long feed at all. The &s;ituation, Sir, of this country, is deplorable beyond de&s;cription. America, the great &s;ource of our riches, is for ever lo&s;t; the brighte&s;t jewel in the crown, is for ever di&s;|placed. Our We&s;t-India i&s;lands are &s;ome of them taken, and the re&s;t in a fair way to be &s;o. Jamaica, Sir, was captured from the Spaniards in the time of the Protector, Cromwell; it will probably revert to the Spaniards during the NO <HI>Protector&s;hip</HI> of the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try&mdash;I hope not, Sir; I &s;peak only my fears. St. Vincent's and Grenada were of &s;ome con&s;e|quence; but no more them:&mdash;<HI>De mortuis nil ni&s;i bonum.</HI> They were once valuable. Ja|maica, if I am rightly informed, produces more &s;ugar and rum than all our other i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies. I am a friend to the im|portation of rum, as its con&s;umption mu&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="33">proportionably decrea&s;e that of French brandy. Our merchants are at this moment anxious for the fate of Jamaica, on which their own con|&s;equence may e&s;&s;entially depend. Our Mini&s;|ters have been wrong in all their proceedings, from the out&s;et to the pre&s;ent moment; and &s;uch is their imbecillity, &s;uch the contempt in which they are held by foreign powers, that we have not one ally on who&s;e faith we can a&s;|&s;uredly depend. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia is doubt|ful at the lea&s;t; and if he were inclined to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, he can do us no &s;ervice in the naval line. The Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia may lend her aid when the fro&s;t &s;hall have given her permi&s;|&s;ion to put her ve&s;&s;els under way; and that may be four or five months after we have no occa&s;ion for their &s;ervice. We have heard &s;omething &s;aid this day of the friend&s;hip of Denmark; but what is Denmark? She weighs nothing in the &s;cale of Europe. We might as rationally hope a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Barbary and her cor&s;airs. Sir, I mu&s;t beg to call the atten|tion of the Hou&s;e to other objects, and can|not but lament, that &s;o many Gentlemen are gone to dinner, when &s;uch important matters are before us; as if eating was the great bu&s;i|ne&s;s of life. Sir, I am bold to aver, that we
<PB N="29" REF="34">have been wrong in all our proceedings, from the commencement of the accur&s;ed American war, to the pre&s;ent moment. The Mini&s;ters, with all their effrontery, dare not &s;ay that we have been right in a &s;ingle in&s;tance. Nothing, Sir, can equal the ob&s;tinacy of the Mini&s;ters. They have been repeatedly told of their errors; but &s;o far from reforming, they continue their career in its full vigour, adding error to error, and crime to crime. Would to God, Sir, their errors were compleated, the mea&s;ure of their iniquities full, and that they were this in&s;tant to receive the reward which mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly awaits their crimes! It is <Q>a con&s;ummation &startq;&endq;devoutly to be wi&s;hed.</Q> One Gentleman in office was to over-run America, and cut the throats of all the <HI>Yankies</HI> (as they are contemptuou&s;ly called) with five thou&s;and men; but experience has told us, that fif|ty thou&s;and would be ineffectual to the pur|po&s;e; and I will be bold to &s;ay, that Ame|rica cannot be &s;ubjugated by any force we can &s;end again&s;t her. There millions of people fighting <HI>pro aris &amp; focis,</HI> for every thing they hold dear and valuable, are not ea&s;ily brought to bow the neck to the yoke of Mini&s;terial tyranny. Mini&s;ters know this,
<PB N="30" REF="35">Sir; they know, though they will not ac|knowledge, that the &s;pirit of Freedom is un|conquerable. I wi&s;h they would read the hi&s;|tory of Ma&s;&s;aniello of Naples, and other pieces of the like kind, which would teach them what amazing effects may ari&s;e from public virtue animating even a &s;ingle brea&s;t. What then will they &s;ay when the whole we&s;tern World is in Arms, from motives the mo&s;t pure and laudable, &s;elf-defence, and the general rights of mankind? I will not tre&s;pa&s;s on that time which I know to be precious; but I have a few que&s;tions to a&s;k, though I have no ex|pectation of a &s;erious reply to them. Will Mini&s;ters be kind enough to tell us what is their plan? Have they any hope of reducing America to obedience, as they call it? Do they think that General Wa&s;hington will com|mand his troops to <HI>pile their arms?</HI> or do they think that &s;uch commands would be obeyed if they were i&s;&s;ued? Can they conceive that our Soldiers will for ever fight and &s;tarve on five-pence a Day? Mi&s;erable Devils as they are, there is not one of them but could eat three meals a day&mdash;if he could get them: but I re|peat what an honourable gentleman &s;aid before, re&s;pecting the Military. We have no occa&s;ion
<PB N="31" REF="36">for Soldiers&mdash;they are a burden and a cur&s;e to this Country, and I much fear they will one day become an in&s;trument in the hands of Mi|ni&s;ters, to rivet tho&s;e fetters they have long been forging for the free-born Engli&s;hman! I could &s;ay much more, Sir, but I fear it would be in vain: Mini&s;ters are grown callous; they heed not, or they de&s;pi&s;e, the complaints of the people. For the rea&s;ons I have a&s;&s;igned, and for a thou&s;and others that I could a&s;&s;ign, I give my hearty concurrence to the propo&s;ed amendment to the addre&s;s to the throne.</P>
<P><HI>Lord G&mdash;ge S&mdash;ckv&mdash;lle</HI> aro&s;e to make one remark on the phra&s;e <HI>Pile their Arms.</HI> He con&s;idered it as an affront to him&s;elf, as if he had i&s;&s;ued &s;uch orders as reduced General B&mdash;c to the nece&s;&s;ity of piling his arms; on the contrary he had i&s;&s;ued proper orders, &s;uch as he conceived the mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure &s;uc|ce&s;s to the Briti&s;h arms. As to the re&s;t of the honourable Gentleman's laboured harangue he &s;hould take no notice of it, as it was fit only to be heard, laughed at, and de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Colonel B&mdash;rr&eacute;</HI> &s;aid he would give full credit to the noble Lord's a&s;&s;ertion. There were no
<PB N="32" REF="37">Gentlemen &s;o happy in i&s;&s;uing proper orders, as tho&s;e who were the very wor&s;t at obeying them. But, Sir, I do not ri&s;e for the &s;ake of making a cur&s;ory remark; I ri&s;e to blame the whole conduct of Mini&s;try, which, from their fir&s;t entrance into office, hath been marked with error, ab&s;urdity and guilt. They have gone on from blunder to blunder, and from crime to crime, till &s;o great a part of the empire is di&s;membered, and the re&s;t in &s;uch imminent danger, that I fear the time is ha&s;tily approach|ing when the meetings of this a&s;&s;embly will be &s;uperfluous, for we &s;hall have nothing left about which to debate. I told you la&s;t year that Spain would join France and America. Was I wrong in my prediction? She has joined them, and God only knows what will be the con&s;equence. You, Sir, know, and Mini|&s;ters know, that all my predictions have been fulfilled. But, Sir, matters are now in a much more deplorable way than they were la&s;t year: your copper-coloured allies, if they are allies at all, are of no u&s;e to their employ|ers; even the wild Indians, the &s;avages as we call them, are not &s;avage enough to fight the battles of the pre&s;ent mini&s;ters; they blu&s;h through their bronze of copper, at the thought
<PB N="33" REF="38">of being allied with the pale-faced Mini&s;ter of the American Department. I need not repeat what has been &s;aid a thou&s;and times in this Hou&s;e, of the cruel butcheries that have been the con&s;equence of the American War. All that has been &s;aid has failed to produce one good effect; let me therefore turn your atten|tion to other objects. Scotland, Sir, is not now in an actual &s;tate of Rebellion: &s;he has &s;een the folly, and felt the con&s;equence of re|belling; but &s;he will not endure your laws in favour of popery; &s;he re&s;i&s;ts the very idea of &s;piritual controul; yet highly favoured as &s;he is by the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, &s;he will &s;eek the fir&s;t opportunity of revolting, if we pur&s;ue our pre&s;ent plan of oppre&s;&s;ion. Ireland, Sir, ought to be now the object of our con&s;ideration. We &s;ee what determined oppo&s;ition in&s;pires the brea&s;t of that Country; a FREE TRADE or ELSE!!! What, Sir, is that ELSE? Let tho&s;e whom it may concern make the be&s;t explica|tion they can of this <HI>po&s;itive</HI> threat; but, while it is yet in our power, let us endeavour to re|tain the loyalty, by con&s;ulting the intere&s;t, of Ireland. A Free Trade mu&s;t be granted; if it be not <HI>granted</HI> it will be <HI>taken.</HI>&mdash;The Iri&s;h will bear no more. They have fifty thou&s;and
<PB N="34" REF="39">Men in arms ready to &s;upport their claim. Can we &s;pare fifty thou&s;and to abide the con|te&s;t? God forbid, Sir, that it &s;hould ever come to a conte&s;t; but &s;omething mu&s;t be imme|diately done, or the con&s;equence will be fatal. I will tell you one fact that comes within my immediate knowledge. The Iri&s;h are the mo&s;t determined people in the world: they do not ha&s;tily re&s;olve, but when once the re&s;olution is formed, it becomes as irrevocable as the Laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians. I have a letter in my pocket, from a worthy friend in Crow-&s;treet, who informs me that the rejoicings on the la&s;t anniver&s;ary of the birth of King Wil|liam, were &s;uperior to any thing of the kind ever &s;een in Ireland. This, Sir, I will ven|ture to pronounce the bolde&s;t threat ever given to the Mini&s;ters of this Country. Tho&s;e who celebrate the birth of our great deliverer in &s;ongs of triumph, cannot but be determined enemies of a &s;et of Men who&s;e conduct &s;uf|ficiently marks their dependence on an intere&s;t of a different nature. In one word, we mu&s;t grant Ireland her wi&s;hes, or the con&s;equences will be fatal to this Country.&mdash;Let me now call your attention to another object of no &s;mall importance. The Freeholders of Mid|dle&s;ex
<PB N="35" REF="40">have been lately in&s;ulted in a way that threatens, if not timely checked, to &s;ap the very vitals of this con&s;titution. The Mini&s;|ter, Sir, has dared to refu&s;e a vacating place to one Candidate, for the <HI>expre&s;s,</HI> though not the <HI>declared,</HI> purpo&s;e of bringing in another. Lord N&mdash;h, Sir, has in effect dared to &s;ay, <Q>&startq;I will be the &s;ole Elector for the County of Middle&s;ex: my voice &s;hall determine who &s;hall be the Man: the freeholders &s;hall have &endq;no choice.</Q>&mdash;This, Sir, was an inroad on the con&s;titution, a violation of the &s;acred rights of Engli&s;hmen, that no Prime Mini&s;ter before the pre&s;ent ever dared to make. We know all Mini&s;ters to be Tyrants; but it remained for the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> to &s;hew to what an extent Tyranny can be carried. What, however, has been the con&s;equence of the noble Lord's proce|dure? It has drawn contempt, and I tru&s;t it will draw vengeance on his head. There is no puni&s;hment equal to his crime. It was an intentional robbery of the highe&s;t nature, and he is not &s;o properly an acce&s;&s;ary, as a principal, before the fact. The Freeholders of Middle&s;ex, Sir, would have been robbed of their liberties, and through them the whole body of the Freeholders of this Country would have been defrauded of their deare&s;t rights, but for the noble exertions
<PB N="36" REF="41">of a few &s;pirited Men; and the generous com|pliance of one venerable Patriot with the wi&s;hes of the people. The good old Man, with one foot in the grave, has his head amid&s;t the Stars! He appears to have &s;tepped forward, in the pre|ci&s;e moment of time, to become the Saviour of this Country, or gloriou&s;ly to fall amid&s;t its ruins; for I am much mi&s;taken if the period be not at length arrived when Mini&s;try will be made to tremble and retire, or when Engli&s;h|men may fit down with folded arms, and in de&s;pair abide the fate that may await them. But, Sir, we will not give up the conte&s;t tamely: we will have yet one &s;truggle more for Liberty, and if we <HI>mu&s;t peri&s;h,</HI> we will <HI>pe|ri&s;h nobly:</HI> we will expire with Freedom in our mouths and on our hearts, and her exit &s;hall be marked with many a &s;car. If I am warm, Sir, is it any wonder? does not the cau&s;e re|quire it? Sir, I do not <HI>gue&s;s,</HI> or <HI>&s;urmi&s;e,</HI> or <HI>believe,</HI> but I KNOW, that matters are come to a cri&s;is; and let tho&s;e who have <HI>de&s;erved, take</HI> the con&s;equence. I could read you many pa|pers of con&s;equence, Sir, but I am too well convinced that a deaf ear will be turned to my intelligence, however important; for the pre&s;ent, therefore, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with
<PB N="37" REF="42">giving my hearty concurrence to the propo&s;ed amendment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B&mdash;rke.</HI> I know, Sir, from vouchers too authentic, I know that the pre&s;ent admi|ni&s;tration is not held in more contempt than it ought to be; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s my admira|tion at the language of that Speech, which has given ri&s;e to the debate of this day; and &s;hall this Hou&s;e echo &s;uch a Speech? Shall it &s;ay that every thing is right, which it knows to be wrong? I am &s;orry, Sir, that it &s;hould be again nece&s;&s;ary to advert to the American war in this place; but this war, one of the fir&s;t cau&s;es of our ruin, &s;till pours its &s;tream of di&s;tre&s;s with unabating rapidity, on this country; and we have nothing now to expect, but the &s;hipwreck of the &s;tate. With France and Spain in the alliance of America, with the powers on the continent of Europe, hi|therto deemed our firme&s;t allies, refu&s;ing their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, what have we to hope? Cannot the Mini&s;try at length tell us, that they are inca|pable of the ta&s;k they have undertaken, and that they know not to &s;teer the almo&s;t &s;hip|wrecked ve&s;&s;el into harbour? Cannot they re|&s;ign the helm to more &s;kilful and more hone&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="43">pilots? To le&s;s &s;kilful and to le&s;s hone&s;t I am &s;ure they cannot. There was a time, Sir, when they boa&s;ted in this Hou&s;e, not of what they had done, but of what they would do, in America. They were to over-run and re|duce the country with a handful of men. They have, indeed, over-run it, till their own men have been repeatedly reduced to a handful. No &s;ooner have their arms received a check, which ought to make them blu&s;h at being thought the Mini&s;ters of this country, than they blazon their ill &s;ucce&s;s in extraordi|nary Gazettes, which the bawling heralds of fame give to the public, who read and blu&s;h to think how <HI>very extraordinary</HI> they are! During the able pre&s;idency of a late Prime Mini&s;ter, our &s;ucce&s;&s;es were &s;o rapid and &s;o numerous, that there remained not time, if there had been in|clination, to amu&s;e the public with ill dige&s;t|ed accounts of battles half won. We had then &s;olid, &s;hort, well-dige&s;ted accounts, not of what had been in contemplation, but of what had been actually performed. The writers were then the hi&s;torians of their own actions, not the pretended heralds of mini&s;terial fame. It would be as ungenerous as unju&s;t, to attribute to our commanders by &s;ea or land,
<PB N="39" REF="44">the ill &s;ucce&s;s that has attended their endea|vours. They have done all, and indeed more than all, that they ought to have done, in obedience to the commands of &s;uch ma&s;ters. The bravery of our troops, if it has not alto|gether equalled, it has left nothing to reproach it in the annals of antiquity. Neither the Grecians or Romans ever fought with more zeal and ardour in the public cau&s;e, than our Britons have fought in obedience to the com|mands of a &s;et of Mini&s;ters&mdash;born indeed to command&mdash;to be obeyed&mdash;and de&s;pi&s;ed.&mdash; America has been reflected on, in this Hou&s;e, and in the public prints, for demanding more than her due; and yet tho&s;e very Mini&s;ters, who&s;e agents were the reflectors, have offered abundantly more than &s;he ever a&s;ked. The time is fa&s;t approaching, when they will offer &s;till more; but even this will be rejected with con|tempt: and when two or three more years are pa&s;t, tho&s;e to whom we u&s;ed to give laws will be dictators to us. I am not fond of predict|ing; but let Mini&s;ters remember what is now &s;aid; let them compare the prediction with the late conduct of America, high &s;pirited and independent as it has been. Let them re|flect
<PB N="40" REF="45">how lately the American cor&s;air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paul Jones.</NOTE> ra|vaged their coa&s;ts; and let them recognize and blu&s;h at the ab&s;urdity of their own con|duct, in claiming of the Dutch as a rebel, the neutral commander, (neutral to the Dutch at lea&s;t) who had taken &s;helter in the bo&s;om of the Texel. The Americans, Sir, are now at lea&s;t on a par with our&s;elves; and they will very &s;oon be our &s;uperiors. Methinks I &s;ee real &s;overeignty &s;it enthroned under the &s;ha|dow of her own vine in the we&s;tern world; I &s;ee her di&s;pen&s;ing her own mild and equitable laws, and millions rejoicing in their happy effects! I think I can &s;ee &s;till farther into fu|turity&mdash;Spain will not be long the tyranne&s;s of South America. Her &s;laves will catch fire at the &s;acred flame of freedom, and the empire of liberty will be as exten&s;ive as the continent!</P>
<P>The evil Genius of this country, Sir, &s;eems to have marked her for de&s;truction; &s;he pur|&s;ues her every foot&s;tep, nor will quit her till &s;he is levelled with the du&s;t! It is painful to have the eye continually on &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s; but whither &s;hall we turn it to obtain a more chearful view!</P>
<PB N="41" REF="46">
<P>I would hope, that there is yet one po&s;&s;ible way of &s;aving this country from utter ruin:&mdash; Let the prevent &s;tate pilots re&s;ign that helm they are no longer capable of &s;teering; let it be entru&s;ted to the hands of men more able and more hone&s;t. Though it be impo&s;&s;ible to recover our former weight in the political &s;cale, it may not be impo&s;&s;ible to prevent its falling with &s;uch a force as to break the beam. With &s;uch an Admini&s;tration as was formed by the late Lord Chatham, a few months would re|&s;tore, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the declining credit of this country. Our fleets and armies with|drawn from America, and directed again&s;t their proper object, the &s;candalous and unnece&s;|&s;ary was in which we are engaged mu&s;t &s;oon cea&s;e; for I yet tru&s;t we have vigour remain|ing to cru&s;h the perfidious hou&s;e of Bourbon.&mdash; I vote, Sir, for the amendment propo&s;ed, from a conviction that every thing ought to be done, to bring Mini&s;ters to the bar of the Pub|lic, to an&s;wer for their repeated and atrocious crimes.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F&mdash;x</HI> gave an eloquent proof of his po|litical knowledge, and the care he took to be well informed re&s;pecting the intere&s;ts of his
<PB N="42" REF="47">country. He mentioned his frequent predic|tions of the ha&s;ty ruin which was de&s;cending on this devoted land; predictions, indeed, which did him&s;elf no particular honour, be|cau&s;e any other man might have equally &s;een the rapid &s;trides we were making towards de|&s;truction. As he had &s;o frequently reprobated the conduct of the American war, he would not lo&s;e time, by endeavouring to prove a fact univer&s;ally &s;een by every man who was not wilfully blind:&mdash;he would only remark, that the original of the American war was a &s;quab|ble for a parcel of damaged tea, and it could hardly fail to end in the lo&s;s of an empire! To the &s;ituation of affairs in Ireland he would not advert: the &s;ubject had been already men|tioned by an honourable Gentleman, and its con&s;equences would be felt by tho&s;e who now turned a deaf ear to the complaints of their &s;uffering fellow-&s;ubjects.&mdash;Of our ill &s;ucce&s;s in the We&s;t-Indies I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, it is too notorious not to &s;trike the ob&s;ervation of every Gentleman. Count d'E&s;taign, the mo&s;t con|temptible of all foreign characters, has tri|umphed in the territories of Great-Britain!&mdash; Give me leave, Sir, to make a &s;hort ob&s;ervation or two on the &s;ituation of our affairs in the
<PB N="43" REF="48">Ea&s;tern world. Our little &s;ucce&s;s in that quarter has been trumpeted by all the heralds of fame, as if we had obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a new empire! In the name of hone&s;ty and common|&s;en&s;e, what are our Ea&s;tern acqui&s;itions?&mdash; how have they been obtained? Will not any man, le&s;s lo&s;t to feeling than a Leadenhall-&s;treet Nabob, blu&s;h to an&s;wer the que&s;tion? I know that great dependance is had on the Ea&s;t-In|dia trade; but I likewi&s;e know, that the French are undermining us, even in this ar|ticle. But, Sir, I will not dwell on a &s;ubject that is a di&s;grace to our country. The making and unmaking Nabobs, for the purpo&s;es of acquiring money, is what a generous mind cannot bear to reflect on. It would be as end|le&s;s as fruitle&s;s, to recount the peculations of the Ea&s;tern world. When the lu&s;t of wealth is to be gratified, its cravings are not appea&s;ed with &s;light oblations!</P>
<P>Our connections on the continent were ne|ver &s;o little favourable as at the pre&s;ent mo|ment. We cannot afford to pay any longer time tho&s;e troops of mercenaries, who have hitherto drained our pockets to do us no kind of &s;ervice. If Ru&s;&s;ia has not refu&s;ed her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
<PB N="44" REF="49">in expre&s;s terms, her equivocation a|mounts almo&s;t to a denial. Pru&s;&s;ia will lend us no kind of aid. How then are we to com|bat the combined force of the hou&s;e of Bour|bon? Who&s;e help are we now to a&s;k?&mdash;There was a time, Sir, when this country poi&s;ed the fate of Europe; but tho&s;e happy days are over, and we now kick the beam.</P>
<P>It is true, that the &s;pirit of adventure has gone forth, and our privateers have met with a rea&s;onable degree of &s;ucce&s;s; but what hath been done by our fleet? For any thing it has accompli&s;hed, might it not as well have re|mained in harbour to the pre&s;ent moment? Take a view of our &s;ituation in any light, and we appear driving headlong to de&s;truction; yet let us not tamely &s;ink under the weight, and give over all for lo&s;t, without one &s;truggle for our expiring liberties. I will give my concur|ring voice for the propo&s;ed amendment, on the principle that induces the drowning man to catch at a &s;traw.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. S&mdash;b&mdash;ge</HI> &s;aid a few words, very vio|lent, and replete with that republican &s;pirit for which he is di&s;tingui&s;hed. He moved for
<PB N="45" REF="50">an impeachment of the mini&s;ter, mentioned &s;omething of Tower-hill and Temple-bar, talked of the nece&s;&s;ity of making an example, and quoted that text of Daniel which &s;ays <Q>It &startq;is better that one Man &s;hould die, than that &endq;a whole nation &s;hould peri&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. D&mdash;nn&mdash;ng</HI> would not enter into the merits of the que&s;tion before the hou&s;e, nor &s;ay how far he thought they were competent to its deci&s;ion. He &s;aid he did not care what might be the particular drift of the que&s;tion, but he was certain that it tended to the pub|lic good from the &s;ide of the hou&s;e whence it had originated, as well as from that by which it had been, and would be, oppo&s;ed:&mdash;he would therefore vote for the amendment with|out he&s;itation.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. S-ll-c-t-r G-n-r-l</HI> took the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion, as if from habit to oppo&s;e a brother lawyer, and from duty (to <HI>him&s;elf</HI>) to &s;upport to mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration. He defended the <HI>American</HI> War from the <HI>pranciple</HI> of cru&s;hing a ho&s;t of <HI>Rabels.</HI> He &s;aid it was of ancient right, and warranted by long u&s;age, which was equal to law, that the Mini&s;ters
<PB N="46" REF="51">&s;hould retain in that Hou&s;e a number of Ad|dre&s;&s;ers to echoe what was delivered from the Th&mdash;e. He did not deny, but that there had been &s;ome errors in the conduct of the war, but &s;aid, that if the matter were once brought to a legal i&s;&s;ue, he had no doubt but that the hou&s;e of Bourbon would <HI>be ca&s;t.</HI> He objected to the propo&s;ed amendment, as being found|ed in ab&s;urdity, and replete with error.</P>
<P>General <HI>C&mdash;n &mdash;y</HI> he&s;itated &s;omething like a half &s;peech&mdash;he begged pardon&mdash;he doubted his own abilities&mdash;he hoped&mdash;he pre&s;umed&mdash;he wi&s;hed, and he feared. He felt &s;ome warmth, but it appeared to be too little to animate him|&s;elf or any one el&s;e. He thought that America was for ever lo&s;t; knew that &s;ome of our We&s;t-India i&s;lands were gone, and trembled for the fate of the re&s;t. He doubted if even Scotland or Ireland were &s;afe:&mdash;yet he hoped &mdash;and he tru&s;ted&mdash;that peace and harmony might be re&s;tored, and that zeal and unanimity would take place of languor and di&s;&s;en&s;ion.</P>
<P>The attention of the Hou&s;e was now called to the &s;peech of Lord <HI>N&mdash;h,</HI> who &s;aid, that having li&s;tened attentively to what had been
<PB N="47" REF="52">&s;aid by all the honourable Gentlemen who &s;poke before him, he hoped he &s;hould be as able, as he was ready, to give every &s;atisfac|tion to the Hou&s;e.&mdash;Mr. Speaker, I concur in &s;ome particulars with &s;everal of the Gentle|men who have been Speakers in the debate of this day; but I cannot be of opinion, that the &s;ituation of this country is &s;o deplorable as &s;ome of them have repre&s;ented it. As I mean to &s;peak at large on the &s;ubject, I &s;hall take up the bu&s;ine&s;s from its commencement. It has been urged, that we have engaged in a war, unju&s;t in it&s;elf, and ruinous in its con&s;e|quences. I believe, Sir, it will be allowed, that all wars, from the beginning of the world to this day, have been commenced on the principle of nece&s;&s;ity, or from what was thought nece&s;&s;ity by the ruling powers, which is the &s;ame thing; for if our Governors are not to determine of the fit and the unfit, all government, all &s;ubordination, will be at an end.</P>
<P>It has been hinted, that the American war originated from a &s;quabble about a quantity of damaged tea. Surely it can be of no con&s;e|quence how, or on what account, it originated,
<PB N="48" REF="53">if the war be in it&s;elf ju&s;tifiable. I believe there are few Gentlemen who will be hardy enough to deny, that the pre&s;ent inhabitants of America are the immediate de&s;cendants of tho&s;e who emigrated from this country in the la&s;t century: the&s;e de&s;cendants then were, of cour&s;e, &s;ubjects of, and bound to yield all true allegiance to, the parent country; I will not &s;ay to the King, or the Mini&s;try, le&s;t I &s;hould affront the Gentlemen of republican principles: but &s;urely the Parliament ought to have had &s;ome controuling power over the&s;e people. It has been &s;aid without doors, that the Ameri|cans are in fact emancipated, becau&s;e they are not repre&s;ented: but this objection will vani&s;h on the &s;ingle con&s;ideration, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible, from their di&s;tance, that they could be repre&s;ented otherwi&s;e than by men of conge|nial &s;entiments cho&s;en in this country to &s;it in this Hou&s;e; and of tho&s;e there are &s;o many, that our Tran&s;atlantic friends do not, in fact, want repre&s;entatives; indeed, I believe they are more faithfully repre&s;ented than &s;ome of the cities and boroughs in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>By an e&s;timate not long &s;ince made, it ap|pears, that the <Q>&s;ummary of the military
<PB REF="54">&startq;charges, for the &s;upport, defence, and pro|tection &endq;of the Colonies of North America</Q> are immen&s;e. I have a &s;hort copy of the&s;e in my hand, which I will read:&mdash;

Hence then it appears, that the military force for the defence, convenience, and protection of North America, has co&s;t this nation from the year 1764 to 1775 inclu&s;ive (for it is for this period the calculation is made) no le&s;s than the enormous &s;um above &s;pecified:&mdash;and is this a country to be lo&s;t; is this a territory to be for ever &s;eparated from the imperial domain of the&s;e realms? Surely the &s;ubjugating her is worth the &s;truggle. Gentlemen who are mo&s;t violent again&s;t the obedience of America, would think them&s;elves in&s;ulted, if obedience &s;hould be refu&s;ed by their own children or &s;er|vants;
<PB N="50" REF="55">but we are apt to forget, in general ca&s;es, what &s;trikes us mo&s;t forcibly in par|ticular.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid again&s;t the propriety of continuing the American war. For my own part, I &s;incerely wi&s;h the war had not com|menced; or that, having commenced, it had long &s;ince ended: but, Sir, the dignity of go|vernment mu&s;t be &s;upported; and tho&s;e who will not yield, mu&s;t be taught &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. It is not for the K&mdash;g's &s;ervants to give up a cau&s;e, in which the honour of the nation is concerned. I am confident, that the majority of the inhabitants of the revolted colonies wi&s;h for a reconciliation with the mother coun|try; and the Gentlemen in oppo&s;ition will agree with me when I &s;ay, that Government equally wi&s;hes for a reconciliation with the mother country. It has been &s;aid, that ad|vances have been made on the part of Ame|rica; that &s;he has petitioned, and that her petitions have been rejected. All this is acknowledged; but it mu&s;t be likewi&s;e con|fe&s;&s;ed that America has been the aggre&s;&s;or. I will not take up and farther time, Sir, than to &s;ay that every exertion has been
<PB N="51" REF="56">made to give force to the operations of Go|vernment. Our Generals, our Admirals have di&s;charged their duty in its fulle&s;t extent, and its remains only in the hand of providence to determine on the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e. For my own part, Sir, I &s;hall be happy to re&s;ign my envied, but not enviable &s;ituation, when|ever a more faithful &s;ervant of the Crown can be found; but till that period &s;hall arrive, I will hope for the countenance and &s;upport of every gentleman who wi&s;hes to maintain the dignity of Government.</P>
<P>This &s;peech being concluded, the que&s;tion was called for with the utmo&s;t violence.</P>
<P>At two in the morning the que&s;tion on the amendment was put, and the motion rejected, 249 to 137. Mr. B&mdash;g and Mr. T. T&mdash;n&mdash;d were Tellers for the Ayes, and Mr. Charles T&mdash;d and Sir G&mdash;y C&mdash;r for the Noes. The main que&s;tion being then put, was carried without any material difference in the numbers.</P>
<P>A motion was now made to adjourn, and the hou&s;e growing vociferous, the adjourn|ment took place accordingly, in the u&s;ual man|ner, till nine o'clock the next morning.</P>
