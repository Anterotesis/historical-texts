<HEAD>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
SIDNEY,
EARL of GODOLPHIN,
Lord High Trea&s;urer of Great Britain.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Dramatick Poem which was
written in the Cau&s;e of Liberty, flies
to Your Lord&s;hip for Protection, who have
been &s;o great a Patron and Protector of Li|berty,
when &s;he was in the utmo&s;t Danger.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
And here, my Lord, as a Lover of Li|berty
and of my Country, I &s;hould nei|ther
think my &s;elf Ju&s;t nor Grateful, if I
&s;hould not make mention of the wonderful
things which Your Lord&s;hip has done for
both.</P>
<P>But what Writer has Force enough to
mention tho&s;e Wonders worthily? Or who
has Art enough to manage &s;o nice a Sub|ject
&s;o dextrou&s;ly, that neither the Enemies
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> may think he &s;ays too much,
nor the Friends too little.</P>
<P>To &s;atisfie the one, and to &s;ilence the
other, I &s;hall briefly inquire what impartial
Hi&s;tory will &s;ay of Your Lord&s;hip, and
the ju&s;t Prai&s;es that You will receive from
uncorrupted Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>When a Ju&s;t and Impartial Hi&s;tory &s;hall
relate the dangerous condition in which the
pre&s;ent War at the beginning found the&s;e
Nations, and the re&s;t of <HI>Europe;</HI> and af|terwards
de&s;cribe the wonderful change to a
State of Conque&s;t and Glory, what va&s;t
Applau&s;e will Po&s;terity give to tho&s;e, who,
<PB REF="5">
by the Wi&s;dom of their Councils, wrought
the Delivery of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>For as it was neither Chance nor brutal
Force, but Coun&s;el that laid the Founda|tion
of the <HI>French</HI> Greatne&s;s under Cardi|nal
<HI>Richlieu,</HI> as it was Coun&s;el and not
Force that carried that Greatne&s;s on, wit|ne&s;s
their Treaties, by which they have ac|quired
more than they have by their Victo|ries,
and witne&s;s their &s;eizing, in one day,
upon a Monarchy of ten times a greater
Extent than their own, &s;o it was neither
Chance nor brutal Force, but Coun&s;el that
&s;hook and overturn'd the exce&s;&s;ive Power
of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But I appeal to the very Enemies of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> to their very Malice, their
Invectives, their Libels, if your Lord&s;hip
has not had &s;o great a &s;hare in the Wi&s;dom
of tho&s;e Councils which have wrought the
Delivery of <HI>Europe,</HI> that you &s;eem to have
been de&s;ign'd by Providence, and to have
been &s;ent into the World on purpo&s;e to
<PB REF="6">
overthrow the va&s;t, but pernicious De&s;igns
of the great Cardinal <HI>Richelieu.</HI></P>
<P>For whom will Hi&s;tory deliver down to
Po&s;terity as the Friend and the intimate
Corre&s;pondent of the Great Captain who
has done &s;uch Glorious Things for us?
With whom has He concerted His Good
and Great De&s;igns? Who duly &s;upply'd
Him with the Nerves of War, the Source
of Di&s;cipline, Spirit and Force? The Great
Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and the Illu&s;trious
Earl of <HI>Godolphin,</HI> will be held by Po&s;te|rity
to have been to this I&s;land, what the
two friendly Gods were formerly e&s;teemed
by the <HI>Grecians,</HI> who were always account|ed
Propitious, when they appeared and
&s;hone together.</P>
<P>That Your Lord&s;hip and your Friend
who have done &s;uch mighty Things for us,
may long be the Ornament and the Defence
of your Country, that the QUEEN may
long be &s;upported by both, and appear be|tween
both, like the Godde&s;s of Wi&s;dom,
<PB REF="7">
with Her peaceful Olive on one Hand,
and Her dreadful Shield on the other, is,
and &s;hall be, the hearty wi&s;h of,</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>WELL Sirs! You have &s;een <HI>Virginia</HI> die! Ye Powers</L>
<L>The mighty difference between her Time and ours.</L>
<L><HI>Virginius,</HI> an old Captain was of <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Who ab&s;ent with his City Bands from home;</L>
<L>Heard a Hot Courtier would his Girl engage;</L>
<L>When po&s;ting back to <HI>Rome</HI> in mighty Rage</L>
<L>This Son of Hector, like a &s;urly Bully,</L>
<L>Kills his poor Child to di&s;appoint her Cully.</L>
<L>That 'tis far otherwi&s;e with us is plain,</L>
<L>While City Captain here makes &s;hort Campaign,</L>
<L>In <HI>Bunhill</HI>-Fields &s;ubduing <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></L>
<L>How oft has Courtier maul'd both Wife and Daughter?</L>
<L>Yet no &s;uch bloody Bu&s;ine&s;s follow'd after.</L>
<L>There's &s;omething in <HI>Virginia</HI> &s;tranger &s;till,</L>
<L>Whom at her own reque&s;t her Sire did kill,</L>
<L>For fear &s;he &s;hould be pleas'd again&s;t her Will,</L>
<L>When will a Dam&s;el of our City &s;train</L>
<L>Re&s;olve to die e'er Ea&s;e her Lover's Pain?</L>
<L>But now to fini&s;h all in a more &s;erious vein,</L>
<L><HI>Virginia</HI>'s Death did Liberty re&s;tore,</L>
<L>As from <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s Tomb it ro&s;e before,</L>
<L>When <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> afterwards en&s;lav'd the State,</L>
<L><HI>Porcia</HI> rous'd <HI>Brutus</HI> to great <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Fate.</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Rome</HI> in Heroes always did abound,</L>
<L>Still from her Women &s;he lo&s;t Freedom found.</L>
<L>So fair <HI>Britannia</HI> o'er the World is fam'd</L>
<L>For Men of dauntle&s;s Spirits and untam'd;</L>
<L>But yet when by her Folly or her Fate,</L>
<L>Her Liberty was in a dangerous State.</L>
<L>The Ble&s;&s;ing ne'er cou'd be &s;ecur'd by Man,</L>
<L>But Heav'n re&s;erv'd th$ immortal Fame for <HI>Anne.</HI></L>

<L>The Tyrant here extended at his length,</L>

<L>Come to Mount <HI>Aventine,</HI> and thou &s;halt &s;ee</L>
<L>Revenge in all her Pomp, and her Fury,</L>
<L>Where &s;he impatiently expects thee <HI>Lucius.</HI></L>
<L>For there the People and the Legions mingled,</L>
<L>Shew the delighted and the wond'ring Gods,</L>
<L>A &s;pirit worthy of that cho&s;en Nition,</L>
<L>Prede&s;tin'd under them to rule the World:</L>
<L>And great Revenge and Liberty is now</L>
<L>Their Univer&s;al Cry. Ju&s;t as I left them,</L>
<L><HI>Horatius</HI> and <HI>Valerius</HI> were arriv'd,</L>
<L>Who from the Senate brought them the full Grant</L>
