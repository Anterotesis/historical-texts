<HEAD>A Word again&s;t a New Election, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is the Boa&s;t of a Party among us, when they In&s;ult their Neighbours upon the late Di&s;tractions, and when they Threaten us with Di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament, the Queen's turning Out her Mini&s;try, and the like, That the People of <HI>England</HI> are gain'd to them; that they have got the Mob on their Side, and that they have opened the Nations Eyes. It &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enquire how far this Thing is true, and to put it into other Words a little, that we may &s;ee by it the <HI>State of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>The true meaning of the Thing is thus ex|plain'd, <HI>viz.</HI> that this is <HI>their Hour and the Power,</HI> &amp;c. That the Time is come upon us when God has peen plea&s;ed (no doubt vindictively) to give &s;ome People up to &s;trong Delu&s;ions, that like the Men of <HI>Sodom,</HI> Blindne&s;s &s;hould over-&s;pread $word$ great Part of the People. And to bring this to pa&s;s, a wicked Party of Men among us have, with too much Succe&s;s, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the gene|ral Defection; have fir&s;t &s;pread a Cloud over the Eyes of the People, and then dug the Pit
<PB N="4" REF="3">
in their Way. By this Party &s;ome of the poor People have been brought to take Error for Truth, Fal&s;hood for Sincerity, Hypocri&s;y for Friend&s;hip, Bondage for Liberty; and in &s;hort, Darkne&s;s for Light.</P>
<P>In Religion, they have been fed with Words for Sub&s;tance, Politicks for Doctrine, and Rail|ing for Applicatiou; have been brought to for|get Charity, Brotherly Forbearance and Mode|ration, taking up Principles of Per&s;ecution, Fu|ry, and Abherence of their Brethren.</P>
<P>In Government, they Embrace ab&s;olute Ty|ranny, for Legal Monarchy, Hereditary Right, in&s;tead of Parliamentary Limitation, and Arbi|trary Will, for Law, by which they are led Blindfold to practice Ab&s;olute Submi&s;&s;ion, with Plea&s;ure, giving up Liberty, with Delight, like the True Tribe of <HI>I&s;acher,</HI> Couching&punc; even be|fore the Load is laid On. Court their own Chains, and Addre&s;s their Soveraign for Slave|ry.</P>
<P>But this has neither &s;unk &s;o Deep, nor &s;pread &s;o Far, as &s;ome People Imagine; what they have hitherto gain'd, will not, we hope, prove &s;o great an Advantage to them, when the People come to Di&s;cover, whether all the&s;e things Tend Indeed one would not have thought things &s;o Ab&s;ur'd as the&s;e, &s;hould gain any Ground a$ all among us. One would have thought, the Ty|ranny we &s;o lately Groan'd under, cou'd not be &s;o Ea&s;ily forgot; that the Revolution might ye$ Stare in their Faces. The Gibbets, on which their Murthered Relations were put to Death are &s;carce taken down; the Spikes that Empail'd
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the Sculls and Quarters of the Nations Patriots, $d the Martyrs of Liberty, are yet &s;tanding $on our Gates, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> $he Fears of Popery; the Concern for Property, $hich po&s;&s;e&s;s the very &s;ame People, who are ow Running back to <HI>Egypt,</HI> cannot but be fre&s;h $word$ their Memories.</P>
<P>When Idolatry was erected in their Streets, nd the <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> &s;tood <HI>Cheek by Joul</HI> with the <HI>Com|$on Prayer;</HI> when the Prie&s;ts began to appear in $heir Habits, and the <HI>Coul</HI> walk'd Hand in Hand $ith the <HI>Circingle;</HI> when the <HI>Pre&s;s</HI> advocated $or the <HI>Gro&s;e,</HI> and the Papi&s;ts debated their Ca&s;e $word$ Public; when Pamphlets for Popery crowded $he Streets, and the <HI>Papi&s;t mi&s;repre&s;ented,</HI> was $efended by Authority; when the Government $as <HI>entirely Popi&s;h,</HI> and the Nobility began to go $o Ma&s;s, to make good an Old Maxim of State, $all'd <HI>Regis ad exemp$$m</HI></P>
<P>One would think (I &s;ay) the&s;e Times could not be &s;o &s;oon forgot, <HI>it is only Forgetfulne&s;s,</HI> the Power of the&s;e Delu&s;ions wants nothing, but to $e a little wip'd off. The Memory of the Com|mon People wants only to be Reviv'd, they on|$y want to have the Remembrance of the&s;e $hings Re&s;tor'd; to have Popery and Slavery a|gain brought into their View, the Wooden Shoes of <HI>France,</HI> the Inqui&s;ition Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> the High Commi&s;&s;ion Court of King <HI>James,</HI> &s;et a $ittle in their Sight again; if the&s;e things were done effectually, the Common People of <HI>Eng|land</HI> would &s;oon Return to their u&s;ual Integrity, the Scales would fall from their Eyes, and the Jacobites would have little cau&s;e to boa&s;t, that they had got the Mob on their Side.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
Never let them promi&s;e them&s;elves, that the&s;e things can con&s;i&s;t with one another, the People of <HI>England</HI> can never be long Deluded, it cannot be imagin'd, that the &s;ame Poor People can pull down the Popi&s;h Ma&s;s-Hou&s;es to Day, and the Di&s;&s;enting Meeting-Hou&s;es to Morrow; can Huzza for King <HI>William</HI> one time, and for Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> another. They want only to have Matters &s;et in a True Light, and their Eyes will open; they want only to know what they are doing, and who manages them; did they know the De&s;igns of this wretched Party; did they &s;ee the Pit at the End of all the&s;e Things, they would Tear tho&s;e People to Pieces, that have thus impos'd upon them, and brought them thus to Act, for that Party they Abhor.</P>
<P>Did the Hone&s;t Well-meaning People, that &s;houted that Fire-Brand into <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> that hung out Flags for him at <HI>Bridgnorth;</HI> that trea|ted him at <HI>Warwick,</HI> and waited on him in Form at <HI>Banbury;</HI> did they know, that at the &s;ame time, that he has taken the Oaths to Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> call'd God to Witne&s;s of his Zeal for Her Go|vernment, and &s;tiled him&s;elf a Champion of the Church. He has, in his more private Conver&s;a|tion, Drank on his Knees to the Pro&s;perity of a <HI>Popi&s;h Pretender,</HI> Acknowledged him for his So|veraign, Cur&s;ed the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, as a <HI>Damn'd Legacy</HI> by King <HI>William,</HI> and wi&s;h'd that Glorious Re&s;torer of <HI>England</HI>'s Liberties, &s;hould be Torn in Pieces by the Rabble.</P>
<P>The&s;e things, and many &s;uch are known, they can be prov'd uyon this Idol, who the People have been deluded to Wor&s;hip; the Time is at
<PB N="7" REF="6">
and, when they &s;hall be made Publick. Can $y Man believe, if this Wolf, in Sheeps Clo|$ing, had been &s;tript, the Prote&s;tants of this ingdom could have Carre&s;s'd and Hugg'd him $word$ they have done? <HI>He would &s;tink in their No&s;trils,</HI> $ey would be a&s;hamed of their Blindne&s;s, and e would not dare to pa&s;s through tho&s;e Places gain, or go back the &s;ame way he came, for $ar of a Ju&s;t Re&s;entment from the People he had $word$ Abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>This being the True State of our Ca&s;e, the $eople of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be Inform'd a little, hey &s;hould &s;ee who&s;e Drudgery they have been $oing, how they have been Impos'd upon, what $hey have done, what they are &s;till doing, and his would bring them to their Wits again.</P>
<P>This Party having, with infinite Cunning, $rought the Poor People to E&s;pou&s;e the Ab&s;ur'd Doctrine of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, the Genuine Intro|$uction of Tyranny and Univer&s;al Bondage, it $word$ Requi&s;ite, in order to take off that Delu&s;ion, that we &s;hould let them &s;ee a little what Slavery is. what the Effects of Tyranny are, what the Difference $s between a Legal Limited Government, where Property is Sacred, Ju&s;tice Unfettered, and the Soveraignty of the Law Acknowledged; and a <HI>French</HI> De&s;potick Tyranny, where Non-Re&s;i&s;ting Principles Subject the very Souls, as well as Bo|dies, of the People, to the Arbitrary Lu&s;t of an Ab&s;olute Tyrant.</P>
<P>It is Requi&s;ite to let the People &s;ee, That the End of all the&s;e things is to En&s;lave us, to bring both our Religious and Civil Liberties into the &s;ame Condition, that the Subjects of <HI>France</HI> are now brought into.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
To let them &s;ee what that Condition is, giv$ them a View of <HI>French</HI> Bondage, and <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Go|vernment, that they may know what it is, and con&s;ider how they &s;hould like it, how well i$ would &s;uite with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty, and wh$ mighty Gainers they would be by the Exchang$</P>
<P>And this is the De&s;ign of the Paper.</P>
<P>To bring this down to the meane&s;t Under|&s;tanding, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the &s;hort Hi&s;tory of our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, an$ give the People of <HI>England</HI> a View of their pre|&s;ent State, how it came to what it is, and what it may come to, if tho&s;e People prevail.</P>

<P>The&s;e are Things we gain'd by the Revolu|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
The&s;e are the things the Enemies of the Re|olution would take from us again: For this $d, they Nouri&s;h Jacobiti&s;m among us, for this $d, they rejoyce when the <HI>French</HI> prevail, and $ok &s;ad when they are beaten: For this, they $ink the Health of the Pretender, as Dr. <HI>Sache|$rell</HI> him&s;elf has openly done: For this they $ur&s;e the Memory of King <HI>William,</HI> for this Dr. <HI>$$cheverell</HI> publickly &s;aid at <HI>Birmingham, as has $en proved upon Oath,</HI> that he hoped to &s;ee King <HI>$illiam De Witted,</HI> That is, <HI>Torn in pieces, by the $ob.</HI> For this, the &s;ame Reverend Dr. $peaking $word$ King <HI>William,</HI> &s;aid he could forgive him any $ing but that <HI>Damn'd Legacy, the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> which He left us.</P>
<P><HI>For this,</HI> the &s;ame Dr. has now &s;et the Nation in Flame; <HI>For this,</HI> they rai&s;e Tumults, make Pro|re&s;&s;es, foment Rabbles, and Mob the Di&s;&s;enters: <HI>For this,</HI> they change <HI>Principles,</HI> change Hands, &amp;c. nd the like: <HI>Remember Britains.</HI> 'Tis <HI>for this,</HI> $ey are Treating, Caballing, and forming Parties or a New Election, that if po&s;&s;ible, they may ring Men into Parliament, that will <HI>Give up</HI> $e Con&s;titution, <HI>abandon</HI> Property, <HI>expo&s;e</HI> Re|gion, and pro&s;titute the Virgin <HI>Liberties</HI> of this $ation, to the ravi&s;hing Lu&s;t of a Popi&s;h Pre|$nder.</P>
<P>What is at &s;take then in your Election of Par|$ment Men? Your Religion, your Liberty, the $evolution, the Succe&s;&s;ion, the Toleration, the Union? <HI>Con&s;ider Britains</HI> what you are a doing: <HI>$hat</HI> have the&s;e things co&s;t the Nation, that now $ey &s;hould not be thought worth keeping? <HI>$hat $word$</HI> is there in <HI>French</HI> Bondage, that we
<PB N="10" REF="9">
&s;hould be fond of re&s;toring it? <HI>What Tempe$</HI> have we found in Papi&s;ts and High Flyers, whe$ they have been uppermo&s;t in the Nation?</P>
<P>How come <HI>France</HI> to groan under Tyranny How come the poor Husbandmen there to hav Lean Carca&s;les, dejected Countenances, an Wooden Shooes? How come the Gentry to b Slaves to the Court, depend upon the War, an$ &s;eek all their Grandeur, in the a&s;&s;i&s;ting the$ King's Tyranny? How ca$$ the heavy Impo|&s;itions of the <HI>Tallie,</HI> the <HI>Capi$iations,</HI> the Far$ of <HI>Salt,</HI> &amp;c. for which they &s;ay what Sums thei Task-Ma&s;ters impo&s;e; mu&s;t buy Salt, wheth$ they can u&s;e it or no; pay 40 s. per Bu&s;hel fo$ it, and ha e the quantity forced upon them.</P>
<P>All this was brought upon them, by giving up their Liberties, by neglecting their Privilege when they had them, by &s;uffering the Encroach|ments of their Monarchs, and permitting th$ Tools of Tyranny, gradually to undermine an$ &s;upplant them; in &s;hort, by choo&s;ing bad Mem|bers of Parliament, and letting their Repre&s;enta|tives give up their Con&s;titution.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> had once Laws, Privileges, Parliaments, Liberties, Charters, and all the advantages of $word$ Free Nation. Their Kings like ours, could levy no Taxes, force no unju&s;t Burthens upon th People. The E&s;tates of the Kingdom re&s;train'd the Ambition of their Princes, and prevented th$ Mi&s;eries of the Subjects for many Ages.</P>
<P>When they had Liberty, they had Wealth they were Rich, Flouri&s;hing and Happy; bu when they lo&s;t their National Priveleges, they Sunk into Mi&s;ery. Slavery always brings Pover|ty,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
they go Hand in Hand together. Their Unlimited Monarchs, to &s;upport their Pride, Ambition, Avarice, and exorbitant Greatne&s;s to carry on their Unju&s;t Wars, and to injure and $ppre&s;s their weaker Neighbours, have made Havock of their own Subjects, have &s;pent their Blood in one, and their Trea&s;ure in the other, till the poor People are reduced to the utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s. Their Goods, their per|&s;ons, their Families, their Blood, their Souls, are at the Ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of the Tyrant that Rules them: They mu&s;t Wor&s;hip God, but as $le would have them, wear no Cloaths but what He permits them, Eat no Bread but what He leaves them: Nothing in <HI>France</HI> can be call'd the r own, all is the Kings, and all are Subjects to His Ab&s;olute Will.</P>
<P><HI>Remember Engli&s;h Men!</HI> Compare this with your own Ca&s;e, where every Man's Hou&s;e is his Ca&s;tle, His Goods are His property, His E&s;tate is his own, the QUEEN cannot command a Shilling, but by $aw; not a Farthing rai&s;ed but by Parliament, paid but by Legal Collection, nor employed when paid, but lyable to an Ac|count to the Parliament.</P>
<P>Your Lives, your Religion, your E&s;tates, your Liberties, are all &s;ecured by Law, and what you have, may truly be call'd your own.</P>
<P>What is the difference between You and the Poor <HI>French,</HI> You are Rich, they are Poor; You are <HI>Well Fed,</HI> they Starve; You have warm Hou&s;es, warm Clothes; they <HI>Peri&s;h</HI> with Cold, wear the wor&s;t of Clothes, Wooden Shooes, and Iron Chains; in &s;hort, you are <HI>alive,</HI> and they are <HI>dead.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
<HI>Con&s;ider Engli&s;h Men:</HI> Learn once but to neg|lect your Liberties, give up your Rights, and choo&s;e Repre&s;entatives that will do the &s;ame. And <HI>France</HI> may &s;ay to You, as the Dead Man's Motto &s;ays to the Living.</P>
<Q><L>As Tou are, &s;o was I;</L>
<L>As I am, &s;o will You be.</L></Q>
<P>Now is the Time for you to look about you: Had your Fathers given up their Liberties, You had been Slaves, Beggars and <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> as th$ <HI>French</HI> now are; and if you give them up, your Children will be &s;o.</P>
<P>Nothing but Liberty pre&s;erves Religion here: Had not your Laws and Liberties been Re&s;cued from Tyranny, in the Revolution, your Religion had not been re&s;cued from Popery and Super|&s;tition; and when ever you give up your Liber|ty to the Will of the Prince, you give up your Religion with it of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothing can &s;ecure Your Liberties or Religion, but your choo&s;ing Members of Parliament, who will def$nd the Revolution, pre&s;erve the Tolera|tion, and &s;ecure the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;ider</HI> then, whether your Liberty, your Religion, your Con&s;titution, your Po&s;terity, do not all call upon you to choo&s;e &s;uch Men as will pre&s;erve them again&s;t all manner of Inva&s;ions, that your Children may never cur&s;e you for be|traying them to Bondage, or your God reproach and puni&s;h you with taking that invaluable Ble&s;&s;ing from you, I mean the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion, becau&s;e you cared not to pre&s;erve or im|prove it when you had it.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
<HI>Unhappy Britain,</HI> that has all her pre&s;ent and $ture Felicity for this World depending upon $word$ trifling a Thing as the Breath of the Mouths $f her Freemen and Freeholders.</P>
<P><HI>Yet Happy Britain,</HI> that has all her valuable $iberties, all her Ble&s;&s;ings committed to her wn keeping, and cannot be ruin'd but by her $wn Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Why do your Enemies plot, contrive, manage, $i&s;-manage, &amp;c. but knowing this Truth that is mu&s;t be your own Act and Deed, if you are de|$royed: They hope &s;o to blind you, that you $ay pull down your own Hou&s;e on your Heads, nd do the Work to their Hands.</P>
<P>This acknowledges their Weakne&s;s, the low|$e&s;s of their Intere&s;t, &s;mallne&s;s of their Power, nd badne&s;s of their Cau&s;e. They cannot lead $ou by Numbers, they cannot drive you by force, they dare not try it; they have no way eft but to delude you by Cunning, and bring you to ruin Blindfold upon your own Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The Queen has now di&s;&s;olved the Parliament, $nd directed a new Choice: A Di&s;&s;olution does $y no means di&s;&s;olve the Right of Choo&s;ing, or the Nece&s;&s;ity of Parliaments.</P>
<P>Let us examin the Ca&s;e a little, and offer &s;om$ Things to your Con&s;ideration. Some are alarm'd $t the Di&s;&s;olution; &s;ome rejoyce at it.</P>
<P>No Man need trouble him&s;elf at the Di&s;&s;olu|ion, if the Freeholders and Electors do but pre|$erve, not their Right of Electing, but their $en&s;es in Election; and that is the End of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
Enquire then who are they that rejoyce at the Di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t Parliament; and are not all the Jacobites, Papi&s;ts, and the Enemies of the Revolution, of that Number?</P>
<P>If Jacobites, if Papi&s;ts, if High-Flyers rejoyce at the Di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t Parliament, it is a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Hint to us, and makes it Natural to enquire what it is they can rejoyce at, but the Hopes, that by fomenting our Divi&s;ions, en|flaming our Parties, and embroiling us one with another, they may get &s;uch Members cho&s;en as may have le&s;s Zeal again&s;t Popery, le&s;s Steadi|ne&s;s again&s;t the Pretender, be le&s;s careful of our Liberties, le&s;s &s;ollicitous for the Nations Peac$+le&s;s warm in Defence of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;i|on, and for Pre&s;ervation of the Union, than they were that went before. Let us de&s;cend to Par|ticulars.</P>
<P><HI>The Jacobites</HI> can have no other View in it than to make ea&s;y the Re&s;toration of the Preten|der, whom they acknowledge for their lawful King. They could not be Jacobites, if they did not de&s;ire this; and they can have no other Rea&s;on for de&s;iring a New Parliament, but in hopes of &s;ome lucky Chance, &s;ome happy Turn, <HI>as they call it,</HI> in favour of their Party. The la&s;t Parliament they found by Experience would not do the Work, another may; and therefore they de&s;ire a Di&s;&s;olution, and rejoyce in it.</P>
<P>Papi&s;ts can have no other View in it, than to make ea&s;y the Recovery of French Power, in which alone Popery can have any pro&s;pect of returning upon us in this Nation: A vigorous pur&s;uit of the War, to the entire Reduction of
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<HI>France,</HI> mu&s;t be fatal to the Popi&s;h Intere&s;t in <HI>$ritain,</HI> who&s;e only hope re&s;ts upon A&s;&s;i&s;tance $om the <HI>French,</HI> either by re&s;toring the Pre|$nder, a Popi&s;h Tool bred up in Super&s;tition, $word$ by any other Method; of which the exorbi|$nt Greatne&s;s of <HI>France</HI> would never want $eans.</P>
<P>If any hone&s;t Men may be &s;atisfied with the $i&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t Parliament, in hopes that $word$ may cool and allay the Heats and Divi&s;ions which are come to &s;uch a &s;atal hight among us, hat might endanger the Publick Peace, and that hey thought the Change of the Parliament the $e&s;t, if not the only way, to prevent tho&s;e Mi&s;|hiefs.</P>
<P>Such will above all Things de&s;ire that we hould choo&s;e Men of peaceable Principles, Men $f Temper and Moderation to &s;ucceed; other|wi&s;e the End will not be an&s;wer'd; and the Sa|isfaction &s;uch have reaped from the Di&s;&s;olution will be entirely di&s;appointed.</P>
