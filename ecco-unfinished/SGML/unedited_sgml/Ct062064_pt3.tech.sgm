<P>ON this day, Schedoni was more com|municative
than on the preceding one.
While they rode apart from the guide,
he conver&s;ed with Ellena on various
<PB N="2" REF="3">
topics relative to her&s;elf, but without
once alluding to Vivaldi; and even con|de&s;cended
to mention his de&s;ign of di&s;|po&s;ing
of her in a convent at &s;ome di&s;|tance
from Naples, till it &s;hould be con|venient
for him to acknowledge her for
his daughter. But the difficulty of find|ing
a &s;uitable &s;ituation embarra&s;&s;ed him,
and he was di&s;concerted by the aukward|ne&s;s
of introducing her him&s;elf to &s;tran|gers,
who&s;e curio&s;ity would be heightened
by a &s;en&s;e of their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances induced him the
more ea&s;ily to attend to the di&s;tre&s;s of
Ellena, on her learning that &s;he was
again to be placed at a di&s;tance from her
home, and among &s;trangers; and the
more willingly to li&s;ten to the account
&s;he gave of the convent of Santa Maria
della Pieta, and to her reque&s;t of return|ing
thither. But in whatever degree he
might be inclined to approve, he li&s;tened
without con&s;enting, and Ellena had only
<PB N="3" REF="4">
the con&s;olation of perceiving that he was
not ab&s;olutely determined to adopt his
fir&s;t plan.</P>
<P>Her thoughts were too deeply en|gaged
upon her future pro&s;pects to per|mit
lei&s;ure for pre&s;ent fears, or probably
&s;he would have &s;uffered &s;ome return of
tho&s;e of ye&s;terday, in traver&s;ing the lonely
plains and rude vallies, through which
the road lay. Schedoni was thankful to
the landlord, who had advi&s;ed him to
keep the guide, the road being frequently
ob&s;cured among&s;t the wild heaths that
&s;tretched around, and the eye often &s;weep|ing
over long tracts of country, without
perceiving a village, or any human dwell|ing.
During the whole morning, they
had not met one traveller, and they con|tinued
to proceed beneath the heat of
noon, because Schedoni had been unable
to di&s;cover even a cottage, in which
&s;helter and repo&s;e might be obtained.</P>
<P>It was late in the day when the guide
pointed out the grey walls of an edifice,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
which crowned the acclivity they were
approaching. But this was &s;o &s;hrouded
among woods, that no feature of it could
be di&s;tinctly &s;een, and it did but &s;lightly
awaken their hopes of approaching a con|vent,
which might receive them with ho&s;|pitality.</P>
<P>The high banks over&s;hadowed with
thickets, between which the road a&s;|cended,
&s;oon excluded even a glimp&s;e
of the walls; but, as the travellers turned
the next projection, they perceived a per|&s;on
on the &s;ummit of the road, cro&s;&s;ing
as if towards &s;ome place of re&s;idence,
and concluded that the edifice they had
&s;een was behind the trees, among which
he had di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>A few moments brought them to the
&s;pot, where, retired at a &s;hort di&s;tance
among the woods that browed the hill,
they di&s;covered the exten&s;ive remains of
what &s;eemed to have been a villa, and
which, from the air of de&s;olation it exhi|bited,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Schedoni would have judged to be
wholly de&s;erted, had he not already
&s;een a per&s;on enter. Wearied and ex|hau&s;ted,
he determined to a&s;certain whe|ther
any refre&s;hment could be procured
from the inhabitants within, and the party
alighted before the portal of a deep and
broad avenue of arched &s;tone, which
&s;eemed to have been the grand approach
to the villa. The entrance was ob&s;tructed
by fallen fragments of columns, and by
the underwood that had taken root
among&s;t them. The travellers, however,
ea&s;ily overcame the&s;e interruptions: but
as the avenue was of considerable extent,
and as its only light proceeded from
the portal, except what a few narrow
loops in the walls admitted, they &s;oon
found them&s;elves involved in an ob&s;cu|rity
that rendered the way difficult, and
Schedoni endeavoured to make him&s;elf
heard by the per&s;on he had &s;een. The
effort was un&s;ucce&s;sful, but, as they pro|ceeded,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
a bend in the pa&s;&s;age &s;hewed a
di&s;tant glimmering of light, which &s;erved
to guide them to the oppo&s;ite entrance,
where an arch opened immediately into a
court of the villa. Schedoni pau&s;ed here
in di&s;appointment, for every object &s;eemed
to bear evidence of abandonment and de|&s;olation;
and he looked, almo&s;t hopele&s;&s;ly,
round the light colonnade which ran along
three &s;ides of the court, and to the trees
that waved over the fourth, in &s;earch of
the per&s;on, who had been &s;een from the
road. No human figure &s;tole upon the
vacancy; yet the apt fears of Ellena al|mo&s;t
imagined the form of Spalatro gliding
behind the columns, and &s;he &s;tarted as
the air &s;hook over the wild plants that
wreathed them, before &s;he di&s;covered that
it was not the &s;ound of &s;teps. At the ex|travagance
of her &s;u&s;picions, however,
and the weakne&s;s of her terrors, &s;he
blu&s;hed, and endeavoured to re&s;i&s;t that
propensity to fear, which nerves long
pre&s;&s;ed upon had occa&s;ioned in her mind.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
Schedoni, meanwhile, &s;tood in the court,
like the evil &s;pirit of the place, examining
its de&s;olation, and endeavouring to a&s;|certain
whether any per&s;on lurked in the
interior of the building. Several doorways
in the colonnade appeared to lead to cham|bers
of the villa, and, after a &s;hort he&s;ita|tion,
Schedoni, having determined to
pur&s;ue his inquiry, entered one of them,
and pa&s;&s;ed through a marble hall to a
&s;uite of rooms, who&s;e condition told how
long it was &s;ince they had been inha|bited.
The roofs had entirely vani&s;hed,
and even portions of the walls had fallen,
and lay in ma&s;&s;es among&s;t the woods
without.</P>
<P>Perceiving that it was as u&s;ele&s;s as
difficult to proceed, the confe&s;&s;or re|turned
to the court, where the &s;hade of
the palmetos, at lea&s;t, offered an ho&s;|pitable
&s;helter to the wearied travellers.
They repo&s;ed them&s;elves beneath the bran|ches,
on &s;ome fragments of a marble
<PB N="8" REF="9">
fountain, whence the court opened to the
exten&s;ive land&s;cape, now mellowed by
the evening beams, and partook of the
remains of a repa&s;t, which had been de|po&s;ited
in the wallet of the guide.</P>
<P>&startq;This place appears to have &s;uffered
from an earthquake, rather than from
time,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, &startq;for the walls,
though &s;hattered, do not &s;eem to have de|cayed,
and much that has been &s;trong lies
in ruin, while what is comparatively &s;light
remains uninjured; the&s;e are certainly
&s;ymptoms of partial &s;hocks of the earth.
Do you know any thing of the hi&s;tory of
this place, friend?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signor,&endq; replied the guide.</P>
<P>&startq;Relate it, then.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall never forget the earthquake
that de&s;troyed it, Signor; for it was felt all
through the Garganus. I was then about
&s;ixteen, and I remember, it was near an
hour before midnight that the great &s;hock
was felt. The weather had been almo&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="10">
&s;tifling for &s;everal days, &s;car$$ly a breath
of air had &s;tirred, and &s;light tremblings of
the ground were noticed by many people.
I had been out all day, cutting wood in
the fore&s;t with my father, and tired enough
we were, when&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is the hi&s;tory of your&s;elf,&endq; &s;aid
Schedoni, interrupting him, &startq;Who did
this place belong to?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Did any per&s;on &s;uffer here?&endq; &s;aid
Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;The Bar&oacute;ne di Cambru&s;ca lived
here,&endq; replied the guide.</P>
<P>&startq;$ah! the Bar&oacute;ne!&endq; repeated Schedoni,
and &s;unk into one of his cu&s;tomary fits of
ab&s;traction.</P>
<P>&startq;He was a Signor little loved in the
country,&endq; continued the guide, &startq;and
&s;ome people &s;aid it was a judgment upon
him for&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Was it not rather a judgment upon
the country,&endq; interrupted the Confe&s;&s;or,
li$ting up his head, and then &s;inking again
into &s;ilence.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
&startq;I know not for that, Signor, but he
had committed crimes enough to make
one's hair &s;tand on end. It was here that
he&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fools are always wondering at the
actions of tho&s;e above them,&endq; &s;aid Sche|doni,
te&s;tily; &startq;Where is the Bar&oacute;ne
now?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot tell, Signor, but mo&s;t likely
where he de&s;erves to be, for he has never
been heard of &s;ince the night of the earth|quake,
and it is believed he was buried
under the ruins.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Did any other per&s;on &s;uffer?&endq; re|peated
Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;hall hear, Signora,&endq; replied the
pea&s;ant, &startq;I happen to know &s;omething
about the matter, becau&s;e a cou&s;in of our's
lived in the family at the time, and my
father has often told me all about it,
as well as of the late lord's goings-on.
It was near midnight when the great &s;hock
came, and the family, thinking of nothing
<PB N="11" REF="12">
at all, had &s;upped, and been a&s;leep &s;ome
time. Now it happened, that the Bar&oacute;ne's
chamber was in a tower of the old build|ing,
at which people often wondered,
becau&s;e, &s;aid they, why &s;hould he chu&s;e
to &s;leep in the old part when there are &s;o
many fine rooms in the new villa? but
&s;o it was.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come, di&s;patch your meal,&endq; &s;aid
Schedoni, awaking from his deep mu&s;ing,
&startq;the &s;un is &s;etting, and we have yet far
to go,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will fini&s;h the meal and the &s;tory
together, Signor, with your leave,&endq; replied
the guide. Schedoni did not notice what
he &s;aid, and, as the man was not for|bidden,
he proceeded with his relation.</P>
<P>&startq;Now it happened, that the Bar&oacute;ne's,
chamber was in that old tower,&mdash;if you
will look this way, Signora, you may &s;ee
what is left of it.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena turned her attention to where
the guide pointed, and perceived the &s;hat|tered
<PB N="12" REF="13">
remains of a tower ri&s;ing beyond
the arch, through which &s;he had entered
the court.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;ee that corner of a windowca&s;e,
left in the highe&s;t part of the wall, Sig|nora,&endq;
continued the guide, &startq;ju&s;t by that
tu$t of a&s;h, that grows out of the &s;tone.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I ob&s;erve,&endq; &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, that was one of the windows
of the very chamber, Signora, and you
&s;ee &s;carcely any thing el&s;e is left of it.
Yes, there is the door-ea&s;e, too, but the
door it&s;elf is gone; that little &s;tairca&s;e,
which you &s;ee beyond it, led up to another
&s;tory, which nobody now would gue&s;s had
ever been; for roof, and flooring, and
all are fallen. I wonder how that little
&s;tairca&s;e in the corner happened to hold &s;o
fa&s;t!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have you almo&s;t done?&endq; inquired
Schedoni, who had not apparently at|tended
to any thing the man &s;aid, and
now alluded to the refre&s;hment he was
taking.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">
&startq;Yes, Signor, I have not a great deal
more to tell, of to eat either, for that
matter,&endq; replied the guide; &startq;but you
&s;hall hear. Well, yonder was the very
chamber, Signora; at that door-ea&s;e,
which is &s;till in the wall, the Bar&oacute;ne
came in; ah! he little thought, I warrant&punc;
that he &s;hould never more go out at it!
How long he had been, in the room I do
not know, nor whether he was a&s;leep, or
awake, $or there is nobody that can tell;
but when the great &s;hock came, it &s;plit
the old tower at once, before any other
part of the buildings. You &s;ee that heap
of ruins, yonder, on the ground, Signora,
there lie the remains of the chamber;
the Bar&oacute;ne, they &s;ay, was buried under
them!&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena &s;huddered while &s;he gazed upon
this de&s;tructive ma&s;s. A groan from
Schedoni &s;tartled her, and &s;he turned
towards him, but, as he appeared &s;hrouded
in meditation, &s;he again directed her
<PB N="14" REF="15">
attention to this awful memorial. As her
eye pa&s;&s;ed upon the neighbouring arch,
&s;he was &s;truck with the grandeur of its
proportions, and with its &s;ingular appear|ance,
now that the evening rays glanced
upon the overhanging &s;hrubs, and darted
a line of partial light athwart the avenue
beyond. But what was her emotion,
when &s;he perceived a per&s;on gliding away
in the per&s;pective of the avenue, and, as
he cro&s;&s;ed where the gleam fell, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the figure and countenance of
Spala$ro! She bad &s;carcely power faintly
to exclaim, &startq;Steps go there!&endq; before he
had di&s;appeared; and, when Schedoni
looked round, the vacuity and &s;ilence of
&s;olitude every where prevailed.</P>
<P>Ellena now did not &s;cruple po&s;itively to
affirm that &s;he had &s;een Spalatro, and
Schedoni, fully &s;en&s;ible that, if her imagi|nation
had not deluded her, the purpo&s;e
of his thus tracing their route mu&s;t be
de&s;perate, immediately ro&s;e, and, followed
<PB N="15" REF="16">
by the pea&s;ant, pa&s;&s;ed into the avenue to
a&s;certain the truth, leaving Ellena alone
in the court. He had &s;carcely di&s;ap|peared
before the danger of his adven|turing
into that ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age, where an
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in might &s;trike un&s;een, forcibly oc|curred
to Ellena, and &s;he loudly conjured
him to return. She li&s;tened for his voice,
but heard only his retreating &s;teps; when,
too anxious to remain where &s;he was, &s;he
ha&s;tened to the entrance of the avenue.
But all was now hu&s;hed; neither voice,
nor &s;teps were di&s;tingui&s;hed. Awed by
the gloom of the place, &s;he feared to ven|ture
further, yet almo&s;t equally dreaded
to remain alone in any part of the ruin,
while a man &s;o de&s;perate as Spalatro was
hovering about it.</P>
<P>As &s;he yet li&s;tened at the entrance of
the avenue, a faint cry, which &s;eemed
to i&s;&s;ue from the interior of the villa,
reached her. The fir&s;t dreadful &s;urmi&s;e
that &s;truck Ellena was, that they were
<PB N="16" REF="17">
murdering her father, who had proba|bly
been decoyed, by another pa&s;&s;age,
back into &s;ome chamber of the ruin;
when, in&s;tantly forgetting every fear
for her&s;elf, &s;he ha&s;tened towards the
&s;pot whence &s;he judged the &s;ound to
have i&s;&s;ued. She entered the hall, which
Schedoni had noticed, and pa&s;&s;ed on
through a &s;uite of apartments beyond.
Every thing here, however, was &s;ilent,
and the place apparently de&s;erted. The
&s;uite terminated in a pa&s;&s;age, that &s;eemed
to lead to a di&s;tant part of the villa, and
Ellena, after a momentary he&s;itation,
determined to follow it.</P>
<P>She made her way with difficulty be|tween
the half-demoli&s;hed walls, and was
obliged to attend &s;o much to her &s;teps,
that &s;he &s;carcely noticed whither &s;he was
going, till, the deepening &s;hade of the
place recalling her attention, &s;he per|ceived
her&s;elf among the ruins of the
tower, who&s;e hi&s;tory had been related
<PB N="17" REF="18">
by the guide; and, on looking up,
ob&s;erved &s;he was at the foot of the
&s;tairca&s;e, which &s;till wound up the wall,
that had led to the chamber of the Ba|r&oacute;ne.</P>
<P>At a moment le&s;s anxious, the cir|cum&s;tance
would have affected her;
but now, &s;he could only repeat her calls
upon the name of Schedoni, and li&s;ten
for &s;ome &s;ignal that he was near. Still
receiving no an&s;wer, nor hearing any
further &s;ound of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he began to
hope that her $ears had deceived her,
and having a&s;certained that the pa&s;&s;age
terminated here, &s;he quitted the &s;pot.</P>
<P>On regaining the fir&s;t chamber, El|lena
re&s;ted for a moment to recover
breath; and, while &s;he leaned upon
what had once been a window, opening
to the court, &s;he heard a di&s;tant report
of fire-arms. The &s;ound &s;welled, and
&s;eemed to revolve along the avenue
$word$ which Schedoni had di&s;appeared.
<PB N="18" REF="19">
&mdash;Suppo&s;ing that the combatants were
engaged at the farthe&s;t entrance, Ellena
was preparing to go thither, when a
&s;udden &s;tep moved near her, and, on
turning, &s;he di&s;covered, with a degree
of horror that almo&s;t deprived her of
recollection, Spalatro him&s;elf &s;tealing
along the very chamber in which &s;he
was.</P>
<P>That part of the room which &s;he
&s;tood in, fell into a kind of rece&s;s; and
whether it was this circum&s;tance that
prevented him from immediately per|ceiving
her, or that, his chief purpo&s;e
being directed again&s;t another object,
he did not chu&s;e to pau&s;e here, he pa&s;&s;ed
on with &s;kulking &s;teps; and, before
Ellena had determined whither to go,
&s;he ob&s;erved him cro&s;s the court before
her, and enter the avenue. As he had
pa&s;&s;ed, he looked up at the window:
and it was certain he then &s;aw her, for
he in&s;tantly $aultered, but in the next
<PB N="19" REF="20">
moment proceeded &s;wiftly, and di&s;ap|peared
peared in the gloom.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed that he had not yet en|countered
Schedoni, but it al&s;o occurred
to Ellena, that he was gone into the
avenue for the purpo&s;e of waiting to
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him in the darkne&s;s. While
&s;he was meditating &s;ome means of
giving the Confe&s;&s;or a timely alarm of
his danger, &s;he once more di&s;tingui&s;hed
his voice. It approached from the
avenue, and Ellena immediately calling
aloud that Spalatro was there, entreated
him to be on his guard. In the next
in&s;tant a pi&s;tol was fired there.</P>
<P>Among the voices that &s;ucceeded the
report, Ellena thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed
groans. Schedoni's voice was in the
next moment heard again, but it &s;eemed
faint and low. The courage which &s;he
had before exerted was now exhau&s;ted;
&s;he remained fixed to the &s;pot, unable
to encounter the dreadful &s;pectacle that
<PB N="20" REF="21">
probably awaited her in the avenue,
and almo&s;t &s;inking beneath the expec|tation
of it.</P>
<P>All was now hu&s;hed; &s;he li&s;tened for
Schedoni's voice, and even for a foot|&s;tep
&mdash;in vain. To endure this &s;tate of
uncertainty much longer was &s;carcely
po&s;&s;ible, and Ellena was endeavouring
to collect fortitude to meet a knowledge
of the wor&s;t, when suddenly a feeble
groaning was again heard. It &s;eemed
near, and to be approaching &s;till nearer.
At that moment, Ellena, on looking
towards the avenue, perceived a figure
covered with blood, pa&s;s into the court.
A film, which drew over her eyes, pre|vented
her noticing farther. She tot|tered
a few paces back, and caught at
the fragment of a pillar, by which &s;he
&s;upported her&s;elf. The weakne&s;s was
tran&s;ient; immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance appeared
nece&s;&s;ary to the wounded per&s;on, and
pity &s;oon predominating over horror,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
&s;he recalled her &s;pirits, and ha&s;tened to
the court.</P>
<P>When, on reaching it, &s;he looked
round in &s;earch of Schedoni, he was no
where to be &s;een; the court was again
&s;olitary and &s;ilent, till &s;he awakened all
its echoes with the name of <HI>father.</HI>
While &s;he repeated her calls, &s;he ha&s;tily
examined the colonnade, the &s;eparated
chamber which opened immediately from
it, and the &s;hadowy ground beneath
the palmetos, but without di&s;covering
any per&s;on.</P>
<P>As &s;he turned towards the avenue,
however, a tract of blood on the ground
told her too certainly where the wounded
per&s;on had pa&s;&s;ed. It guided her to
the entrance of a narrow pa&s;&s;age, that
&s;eemingly led to the foot of the tower;
but here &s;he he&s;itated, fearing to tru&s;t
the ob&s;curity beyond. For the fir&s;t
time, Ellena conjectured, that not
Schedoni, but Spalatro might be the
<PB N="22" REF="23">
per&s;on &s;he had &s;een, and that, though
he was wounded, vengeance might give
him &s;trength to &s;trike his &s;tiletto at the
heart of whom&s;oever approached him,
while the du&s;kine&s;s of the place would $a|the
deed.</P>
<P>She was yet at the entrance of the
pa&s;&s;age, fearful to enter, and reluctant
to leave it, li&s;tening for a &s;ound, and
&s;till hearing at intervals, &s;welling though
feeble groans; when quick &s;teps were
&s;uddenly heard advancing up the grand
avenue, and pre&s;ently her own name
was repeated loudly in the voice of
Schedoni. His manner was hurried as
he advanced to meet her, and he threw an
eager glance round the court. &startq;We
mu&s;t be gone,&endq; &s;aid he, in a low tone,
and taking her arm within his. &startq;Have
you &s;een any one pa&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have &s;een a wounded man enter
the court,&endq; replied Ellena, &startq;and feared
he was your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
&startq;Where?&mdash;Which way did he go!&endq;
inquired Schedoni, eagerly, while his
eyes glowed, and his countenance be|came
fell.</P>
<P>Ellena, in&s;tantly comprehending his
motive for the que&s;tion, would not ac|knowledge
that &s;he knew whither. Spa|latro
had withdrawn; and, reminding
him of the danger of their &s;ituation,
&s;he entreated that they might quit the
villa immediately.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;un is already &s;et,&endq; &s;he added.
&startq;I tremble at what may be the perils
of this place at &s;uch an ob&s;cure hour,
and even at what may be tho&s;e of our
road at a later!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are &s;ure he was wounded?&endq;
&s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>&startq;Too &s;ure,&endq; replied Ellena, faintly.</P>
<P>&startq;Too &s;ure!&endq; &s;ternly exclaimed Sche|doni.</P>
<P>&startq;Let us depart, my father; O let us
go this in&s;tant!&endq; repeated Ellena.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
&startq;What is the meaning of all this!&endq;
a&s;ked Schedoni, with anger. &startq;You
cannot, &s;urely, have the weakne&s;s to pity
this fellow!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is terrible to &s;ee any one &s;uffer,&endq;
&s;aid Ellena. &startq;Do not, by remaining
here, leave me a po&s;&s;ibility of grieving for
you. What angui&s;h it would occa&s;ion
you, to &s;ee me bleed; judge, then, what
mu&s;t be mine, if you are wounded by the
dagger of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni &s;tifled the groan which &s;welled
from his heart, and abruptly turned away.</P>
<P>&startq;You trifle with me,&endq; he &s;aid, in the
next moment: &startq;you do not know that
the villain is wounded. I fired at him, it
is true, at the in&s;tant I &s;aw him enter
the avenue, but he has e&s;caped me.
What rea&s;on have you for your &s;uppo|&s;ition?&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena was going to point to the track
of blood on the ground, at a little di&s;|tance,
but checked her&s;elf; con&s;idering
<PB N="25" REF="26">
that this might guide him on to Spa|latro,
and again &s;he entreated they might
depart, adding, &startq;O! &s;pare your&s;elf,
and him!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What! &s;pare an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!&endq; &s;aid Sche|doni,
impatiently.</P>
<P>&startq;An a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in! He <HI>has,</HI> then, attempted
your life?&endq; exclaimed Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;Why no, not ab&s;olutely that,&endq; &s;aid
Schedoni, recollecting him&s;elf, &startq;but&mdash;
what does the fellow do here? Let me
pa&s;s, I will find him.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena &s;till hung upon his garment,
while, with per&s;ua&s;ive tenderne&s;s, &s;he en|deavoured
to awaken his humanity. &startq;O!
if you had ever known what it was to
expect in&s;tant death,&endq; &s;he continued,
&startq;you would pity this man now, as he,
perhaps, has &s;ometimes pitied others! I
have known &s;uch &s;uffering, my father,
and can, therefore, feel even for him!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you know for <HI>whom</HI> you are
pleading?&endq; &s;aid the di&s;tracted Schedoni,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
while every word &s;he had uttered &s;eemed
to have penetrated his heart. The &s;urprize
which this que&s;tion awakened in Ellena's
countenance, recalled him to a con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
of his imprudence; he recollected
that Ellena did not certainly know the
office, with which Spalatro had been com|mi&s;&s;ioned
again&s;t her: and when he con|&s;idered
that this very Spalatro, whom
Ellena had with &s;uch &s;implicity &s;uppo&s;ed
to have, at &s;ome time, &s;pared a life through
pity, bad in truth &s;pared her own, and,
yet more, had been eventually a means
of preventing him from de&s;troying his
own child, the Confe&s;&s;or turned in horror
from his de&s;ign; all his pa&s;&s;ions changed,
and he abruptly quitted the court, nor
pau&s;ed till he reached the farthe&s;t ex|tremity
of the avenue, where the guide
was in waiting with the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>A recollection of the conduct of Spa|latro
re&s;pecting Ellena had thus induced
Schedoni to &s;pare him; but this was all;
<PB N="27" REF="28">
it did not prevail with him to inquire
into the condition of this man, or to
mitigate his puni&s;hment; and, without
remor&s;e, he now left him to his fate.</P>
<P>With Ellena it was otherwi&s;e; though
&s;he was ignorant of the obligation &s;he
owed him, &s;he could not know that any
human being was left under &s;uch circum|&s;tances
of &s;uffering and &s;olitude, without
experiencing very painful emotion; but,
con&s;idering how expeditiou&s;ly Spalatro
had been able to remove him&s;elf, &s;he en|deavoured
to hope that his wound was
not mortal.</P>
<P>The travellers, mounting their hor&s;es
in &s;ilence, left the ruin, and were $or
&s;ome time too much engaged by the
impre&s;&s;ion of the late occurrences, to
conver&s;e together. When, at length, El|lena
inquired the particulars of what had
pa&s;&s;ed in the avenue, &s;he under&s;tood that
Schedoni, on pur&s;uing Spalatro, had &s;een
him there only for a moment. Spalatro
<PB N="28" REF="29">
had e&s;caped by &s;ome way unknown to
the Confe&s;&s;or, and had regained the in|terior
of the ruin, while his pur&s;uers
were yet following the avenue. The cry,
which Ellena had imagined to proceed
from the interior, was uttered, as it now
appeared, by the guide, who, in his
ha&s;te, had fallen over &s;ome fragments
of the wall that lay &s;cattered in the
avenue: the fir&s;t report of arms had
been from the trombone, which Schedoni
had di&s;charged on reaching the portal;
and the la&s;t, when he fired a pi&s;tol, on
perceiving Spalatro pa&s;&s;ing from the court.</P>
<P>&startq;We have had trouble enough in run|ning
after this fellow,&endq; &s;aid the guide,
&startq;and could not catch him at la&s;t. It
is &s;trange that, if he came to look for
us he &s;hould run away &s;o when he
had found us! I do not think he meant
us any harm, after all, el&s;e he might have
done it ea&s;ily enough in that dark pa&s;&s;age;
in&s;tead whereof he only took to his heels!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="30">
&startq;Silence!&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, &startq;fewer
words, friend.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Signor, he's peppered now,
however; &s;o we need not be afraid;
his wings are clipped for one while, &s;o
he cannot overtake us. We need not
be in &s;uch a hurry, Signor, we &s;hall
get to the inn in good time yet. It is
upon a mountain yonder, who&s;e top
you may &s;ee upon that red &s;treak in
the we&s;t. He cannot come after us; I
my&s;elf &s;aw his arm was wounded.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Did you &s;o?&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, &s;harply:
&startq;and pray where was you when you
&s;aw &s;o much? It was more than I &s;aw.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I was clo&s;e at your heels, Signor,
when you fired the pi&s;tol.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I do not remember to have heard
you there,&endq; ob&s;erved the Confe&s;&s;or: &startq;and
why did you not come forward, in&s;tead
of retreating? And where, al&s;o, did you
hide your&s;elf while I was &s;earching for
the fellow, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting me in the
pur&s;uit?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">
The guide gave no an&s;wer, and El|lena,
who had been attentively ob&s;erv|ing
him during the whole of this con|ver&s;ation,
perceived that he was now
con&s;iderably embarra&s;&s;ed; &s;o that her
former &s;u&s;picions as to his integrity be|gan
to revive, notwith&s;tanding the &s;e|veral
circum&s;tances, which had occurred
to render them improbable. There was,
however, at pre&s;ent no opportunity for
farther ob&s;ervation, Schedoni having,
contrary to the advice of the guide, im|mediately
quickened his pace, and the
hor&s;es continuing on the full gallop, till
a &s;teep a&s;cent compelled them to relax
their &s;peed.</P>
<P>Contrary to his u&s;ual habit, Schedoni
now, while they &s;lowly a&s;cended, ap|peared
de&s;irous of conver&s;ing with this
man, and a&s;ked him &s;everal que&s;tions
relative to the villa they had left; and,
whether it was that he really felt an in|tere&s;t
on the &s;ubject, or that he wi&s;hed
<PB N="31" REF="32">
to di&s;cover if the man had deceived him
in the circum&s;tances he had already nar|rated,
from which he might form a
judgment as to his general character, he
pre&s;&s;ed his inquiries with a patient mi|nutene&s;s,
that &s;omewhat &s;urprized Ellena.
During this conver&s;ation, the deep twi|light
would no longer permit her to
notice the countenances of either Sche|doni,
or the guide, but &s;he gave much
attention to the changing tones of their
voices, as different circum&s;tances and
emotions &s;eemed to affect them. It is to
be ob&s;erved, that during the whole of this
di&s;cour&s;e, the guide rode at the &s;ide of
Schedoni.</P>
<P>While the Confe&s;&s;or appeared to be
mu&s;ing upon&s;omething, which the pea&s;ant
had related re&s;pecting the Bar&oacute;ne di Cam|bru&s;ca,
Ellena inquired as to the fate of
the other inhabitants of the villa.</P>
<P>&startq;The falling of the old tower was
enough for them,&endq; replied the guide;
<PB N="32" REF="33">
&startq;the cra&s;h waked them all directly, and
they had time to get out of the new
buildings, before the &s;econd and third
&s;hocks laid them al&s;o in ruins. They
ran out into the woods for &s;afety, and
found it too, for they happened to take a
different road from the earthquake. Not
a &s;oul &s;uffered, except the Bar&oacute;ne, and
he de&s;erved it well enough. O! I could
tell &s;uch things that I have heard of
him!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What became of the re&s;t of the
family?&endq; interrupted Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, Signor, they were &s;cattered here
and there, and every where; and they
none of them ever returned to the old &s;pot.
No! no! they had &s;uffered enough there
already, and might have &s;uffered to this
day, if the earthquake had not hap|pened.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If it had <HI>not</HI> happened?&endq; repeated
Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, Signora, for that put an end to
the Bar&oacute;ne. If tho&s;e walls could but
<PB N="33" REF="34">
&s;peak they could tell &s;trange things, for
they have looked upon &s;ad doings: and
that chamber, which I &s;hewed you, Sig|nora,
nobody ever went into it but him|&s;elf,
except the &s;ervant, to keep it in
order, and that he would &s;carcely &s;uffer,
and always &s;taid in the room the while.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He had probably trea&s;ure &s;ecreted
there,&endq; &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;No, Signora, no trea&s;ure! He had
always a lamp burning there; and &s;ome|times
in the night he has been heard&mdash;
Once, indeed, his valet happened to&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come on,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, inter|rupting
him; &startq;keep pace with me. What
idle dream are you relating now?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is about the Bar&oacute;ne di Cambru&s;ca,
Signor, him that you was a&s;king me &s;o
much about ju&s;t now. I was &s;aying what
&s;trange ways he had&punc; and how that, on
one &s;tormy night in December, as my
cou&s;in Franci&s;co told my father, who told
me, and he lived in the family at the
time it happened&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
&startq;What happened?&endq; &s;aid Schedoni,
ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>&startq;What I am going to tell, Signor.
My cou&s;in lived there at the time; &s;o,
however <HI>unbelievable</HI> it may &s;eem, you
may depend upon it, it is all true. My
father knows I would not believe it my|&s;elf
till&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Enough of this,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni;
&startq;no more. What family had this Ba|r&oacute;ne
&mdash;had he a wife at the time of this
de&s;tructive &s;hock?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, truly, Signor, he had, as I was
going to tell, if you would but conde|&s;cend
to have patience.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Bar&oacute;ne had more need of that,
friend; I have no wife.&endq;&mdash;&startq;The Bar&oacute;ne's
wife had mo&s;t need of it, Signor, as you
&s;hall hear. A good &s;oul, they &s;ay, was
the Barone&s;fa! but luckily &s;he died many
years before. He had a daughter, al&s;o,
and, young as &s;he was, &s;he had lived too
long, but for the earthquake which &s;et her
free.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
&startq;How far is it to the inn?&endq; &s;aid the
Confe&s;&s;or, roughly.</P>
<P>&startq;When we get to the top of this hill,
Signor, you will &s;ee it on the next, if
any light is &s;tirring, for there will only
be the hollow between us. But do not
be alarmed, Signor, the fellow we left
cannot overtake us. Do you know much
about him, Signor?&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni inquired whether the trom|bone
was charged; and, di&s;covering that
it was not, ordered the man to load
immediately.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, Signor, if you knew as much
of him as I do, you could not be more
afraid!&endq; &s;aid the pea&s;ant, while he &s;topped
to obey the order.</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tood that he was a &s;tranger
to you!&endq; ob&s;erved the Confe&s;&s;or, with
&s;urprize.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, Signor, he is, and he is not;
I know more about him than he thinks
for.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">
&startq;You &s;eem to know a va&s;t deal too
much of other per&s;ons affairs,&endq; &s;aid Sche|doni,
in a tone that was meant to &s;ilence him.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, that is ju&s;t what he would
&s;ay, Signor; but bad deeds will out, whe|ther
people like them to be known or not.
This man comes to our town &s;ometimes
to market, and nobody knew where he
came from for a long while; &s;o they &s;et
them&s;elves to work and found it out at
la&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We &s;hall never reach the &s;ummit of
this hill,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, te&s;tily.</P>
<P>&startq;And they found out, too, a great
many &s;trange things about him,&endq; con|tinued
the guide.</P>
<P>Ellena, who had attended to this di&s;|cour&s;e
with a degree of curio&s;ity that
was painful, now li&s;tened impatiently for
what might be farther mentioned concern|ing
Spalatro, but without daring to in|vite,
by a &s;ingle que&s;tion, any di&s;covery
<PB N="37" REF="38">
on a &s;ubject which appeared to be &s;o inti|mately
connected with Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;It was many years ago,&endq; rejoined the
guide, &startq;that this man came to live in
that &s;trange hou&s;e on the &s;ea-&s;hore. It
had been &s;hut up ever &s;ince&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What are you talking of now?&endq; in|terrupted
the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, Signor, you never will let me
tell you. You always &s;nap me up &s;o
&s;hort at the beginning, and then a&s;k
&mdash;what am I talking about! I was going
to begin the &s;tory, and it is a pretty
long one. But fir&s;t of all, Signor, who
do you &s;uppo&s;e this man belonged to!
And what do you think the people de|termined
to do, when the report was fir&s;t
&s;et a-going? only they could not be &s;ure
it was true, and any body would be un|willing
enough to believe &s;uch a &s;hock|ing&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have no curio&s;ity on the &s;ub|ject,&endq;
replied the Confe&s;&s;or &s;ternly inter|rupting
<PB N="38" REF="39">
him; &startq;and de&s;ire to hear no more
concerning it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I meant no harm, Signor,&endq; &s;aid the
man; &startq;I did not know it concerned
you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And who &s;ays that it does concern,
me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nobody, Signor, only you &s;eemed
to be in a bit of a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o I
thought&mdash;But I meant no harm, Signor,
only as he happened to be your guide
part of the way, I gue&s;&s;ed you might like
to know &s;omething of him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All that I de&s;ire to know of my guide
is, that he does his duty&endq; replied Sche|doni,
&startq;that he conducts me &s;afely, and
under&s;tands when to be &s;ilent.&endq;</P>
<P>To this the man replied nothing, but
&s;lackened his pace, and &s;lunk behind his
reprover.</P>
<P>The travellers reaching, &s;oon after,
the &s;ummit of this long hill, looked out
for the inn of which they had been told;
<PB N="39" REF="40">
but darkne&s;s now confounded every ob|ject,
and no dome&s;tic light twinkling,
however di&s;tantly, through the gloom,
gave &s;ignal of &s;ecurity and comfort.
They de&s;cended dejectedly into the hollow
of the mountains, and found them&s;elves
once more immerged in woods. Sche|doni
again called the pea&s;ant to his &s;ide,
and bade him keep abrea&s;t of him, but
he did not di&s;cour&s;e; and Ellena was
too thoughtful to attempt conver&s;ation.
The hints, which the guide had thrown
out re&s;pecting Spalatro, had increa&s;ed her
curio&s;ity on that &s;ubject; but the conduct
of Schedoni, his impatience, his embar|ra&s;&s;ment,
and the deci&s;ive manner in
which he had put an end to the talk of the
guide, excited a degree of &s;urprize, that
bordered on a&s;toni&s;hment. As &s;he had,
however, no clue to lead her conjectures
to any point, &s;he was utterly bewildered
in &s;urmi&s;e, under&s;tanding only that Sche|doni
had been much more deeply con|nected
<PB N="40" REF="41">
with Spalatro than &s;he had hitherto
believed.</P>
<P>The travellers having de&s;cended into
the hollow, and commenced the a&s;cent of
the oppo&s;ite height, without di&s;covering
any &s;ymptom of a neighbouring town,
began again to fear that their conductor
had deceived them. It was now &s;o dark
that the road, though the &s;oil was a lime|&s;tone,
could &s;carcely be di&s;cerned, the
woods on either &s;ide forming a &startq;clo&s;e
dungeon of innumerous boughs,&endq; that
totally excluded the twilight of the &s;tars.</P>
<P>While the Confe&s;&s;or was que&s;tioning
the man, with &s;ome &s;everity, a faint
&s;houting was heard from a di&s;tance,
and he &s;topped the hor&s;es to li&s;ten from
what quarter it came.</P>
<P>&startq;That comes the way we are going,
Signor,&endq; &s;aid the guide.</P>
<P>&startq;Hark!&endq; exclaimed Schedoni, &startq;tho&s;e
are &s;trains of revelry!&endq;</P>
<P>A confu&s;ed &s;ound of voices, laughter,
and mu&s;ical in&s;truments, was heard,
<PB N="41" REF="42">
and, as the air blew &s;tronger, tambo|rines
and flutes were di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>&startq;Oh! Oh! we are near the end of
our journey!&endq; &s;aid the pea&s;ant; &startq;all
this comes from the town we are going
to. But what makes them all &s;o merry,
I wonder!&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena, revived by this intelligence,
followed with alacrity the &s;udden &s;peed
of the Confe&s;&s;or; and pre&s;ently reach|ing
a point of the mountain, where the
woods opened, a clu&s;ter of lights on
another &s;ummit, a little higher, more
certainly announced the town.</P>
<P>They &s;oon after arrived at the ruin|ous
gates, which had formerly led to a
place of &s;ome &s;trength, and pa&s;&s;ed at
once from darkne&s;s and de&s;olated walls,
into a market place, blazing with light
and re&s;ounding with the multitude.
Booths, fanta&s;tically hung with lamps,
and filled with merchandize of every
kind, di&s;po&s;ed in the gaye&s;t order,
<PB N="42" REF="43">
were &s;pread on all &s;ides, and pea&s;ants
in their holiday cloaths, and parties of
ma&s;ks crowded every avenue. Here
was a band of mu&s;icians, and there a
group of dancers; on one &s;pot the
<HI>outr&eacute;</HI> humour of a zanni provoked the
never-failing laugh of an Italian rab|ble,
in another the <HI>improve&s;atore,</HI> by
the pathos of his &s;tory, and the per|&s;ua&s;ive
&s;en&s;ibility of his &s;trains, was
holding the attention of his auditors,
as in the hands of magic. Farther on
was a &s;tage rai&s;ed for a di&s;play of fire|works,
and near this a theatre, where
a mimic opera, the &startq;&s;hadow of a
&s;hade,&endq; was exhibiting, whence the
roar of laughter, excited by the prin|cipal
<HI>buffo</HI> within, mingled with the
heterogeneous voices of the venders of
ice, maccaroni, &s;herbet, and diavoloni,
without.</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or looked upon this &s;cene
with di&s;appointment and ill-humour,
<PB N="43" REF="44">
and bade the guide go before him, and
&s;hew the way to the be&s;t inn; an of|fice
which the latter undertook with
great glee, though he made his way
with difficulty. &startq;To think I &s;hould
not know it was the time of the fair!&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;though, to &s;ay truth, I ne|ver
was at it but once in my life, &s;o it
is not &s;o &s;urprizing, Signor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Make way through the crowd,&endq;
&s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;After jogging on &s;o long in the
dark, Signor, with nothing at all to be
&s;een,&endq; continued the man, without at|tending
to the direction, &startq;then to
come, all of a &s;udden, to &s;uch a place
as this, why it is like coming out of
purgatory into paradi&s;e! Well! Sig|nor,
you have forgot all your quanda|ries
now; you think nothing now
about that old ruinous place where we
had &s;uch a race after the man, that
would not murder us; but that &s;hot I
fired did his bu&s;ine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">
&startq;You fired!&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, arou&s;ed
by the a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signor, as I was looking
over your &s;houlder; I &s;hould have
thought you mu&s;t have heard it!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould have thought &s;o, too,
friend.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, Signor, this fine place has
put all that out of your head, I war|rant,
as well as what I &s;aid about that
&s;ame fellow; but, indeed, Signor, I
did not know he was related to you,
when I talked &s;o of him. But, per|haps,
for all that, you may not know
the piece of his &s;tory I was going to
tell you, when you cut me off &s;o &s;hort,
though you are better acquainted with
one another than I gue&s;&s;ed for; &s;o,
when I come in from the fair, Signor,
if you plea&s;e, I will tell it you; and it
is a pretty long hi&s;tory, for I happen
to know the whole of it; though,
where you cut me &s;hort, when you
<PB N="45" REF="46">
was in one of tho&s;e quandaries, was
only ju&s;t at the beginning, but no
matter for that, I can begin it again,
for&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is all this!&endq; &s;aid Schedoni,
again recalled from one of the thought|ful
moods in which he had &s;o habitu|ally
indulged, that even the bu&s;tle
around him had failed to interrupt the cour&s;e
of his mind. He now bade the
pea&s;ant be &s;ilent; but the man was too
happy to be tractable, and proceeded
to expre&s;s all he felt, as they advanced
&s;lowly through the crowd. Every ob|ject
here was to him new and delight|ful;
and, nothing doubting that it mu&s;t
be equally &s;o to every other per&s;on,
he was continually pointing out to the
proud and gloomy Confe&s;&s;or the trivial
&s;ubjects of his own admiration. &startq;See!
Signor, there is Punchinello, &s;ee! how
he eats the hot maccaroni! And look
there, Signor! there is a juggler! O!
<PB N="46" REF="47">
good Signor, &s;top one minute, to look
at his tricks. See! he has turned a
monk into a devil already, in the twink|ling
of an eye!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Silence! and proceed,&endq; &s;aid Sche|doni.</P>
<P>&startq;That is what I &s;ay, Signor:&mdash;
&s;ilence! for the people make &s;uch a
noi&s;e that I cannot hear a word you
&s;peak.&mdash;Silence, there!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Con&s;idering that you could not
hear, you have an&s;wered wonderfully
to the purpo&s;e,&endq; &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! Signora! is not this better than
tho&s;e dark woods and hills? But what
have we here? Look, Signor, here is a
fine &s;ight!&endq;</P>
<P>The crowd, which was a&s;&s;embled round
a &s;tage on which &s;ome per&s;ons grote&s;quely
dre&s;&s;ed, were performing, now interrupt|ing
all farther progre&s;s, the travellers were
compelled to &s;top at the foot of the plat|form.
The people above were acting
<PB N="47" REF="48">
what &s;eemed to have been intended for a
tragedy, but what their &s;trange ge&s;tures,
uncouth recitation, and incongruous coun|tenances,
had transformed into a comedy.</P>
<P>Schedoni, thus obliged to pau&s;e, with|drew
his attention from the &s;cene; Ellena
con&s;ented to endure it, and the pea&s;ant,
with gaping mouth and &s;taring eyes, &s;tood
like a &s;tatue, yet not knowing whether he
ought to laugh or cry, till &s;uddenly turn|ing
round to the Confe&s;&s;or, who&s;e hor&s;e
was of nece&s;&s;ity clo&s;e to his, he &s;eized
his arm, and pointing to the &s;tage, called
out, &startq;Look! Signor, &s;ee! Signor, what
a &s;coundrel! what a villain! See! he has
murdered his own daughter!&endq;</P>
<P>At the&s;e terrible words, the indignation
of Schedoni was done away by other emo|tions;
he turned his eyes upon the &s;tage,
and perceived that the actors were per|forming
the &s;tory of Virginia. It was at
the moment when &s;he was dying in the
arms of her father, who was holding up
<PB N="48" REF="49">
the poniard, with which he had &s;tabbed
her. The feelings of Schedoni, at this
in&s;tant, inflicted a puni&s;hment almo&s;t
worthy of the crime he had meditated.</P>
<P>Ellena, &s;truck with the action, and
with the contra&s;t which it &s;eemed to
offer to what &s;he had believed to have
been the late conduct of Schedoni to|wards
her&s;elf, looked at him with mo&s;t
expre&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s, and as his glance
met her's, &s;he perceived, with &s;urprize,
the changing emotions of his &s;oul, and
the inexplicable character of his counte|nance.
Stung to the heart, the Confe&s;&s;or
&s;uriou&s;ly &s;purred his hor&s;e, that he might
e&s;cape from the &s;cene, but the poor ani|mal
was too &s;piritle&s;s and jaded, to force
its way through the crowd; and the pea|&s;ant,
vexed at being hurried from a place
where, almo&s;t for the fir&s;t time in his
life, he was &s;uffering under the &s;trange
delights of artificial grief, and half an|gry,
to ob&s;erve an animal, of which he
<PB N="49" REF="50">
had the care, ill treated, loudly remon|&s;trated,
and &s;eized the bridle of Sche|doni,
who, &s;till more incen&s;ed, was ap|plying
the whip to the &s;houlders of the
guide, when the crowd &s;uddenly fell back
and opened a way, through which the
travellers pa&s;&s;ed, and arrived, with little
further interruption, at the door of the
inn.</P>
<P>Schedoni was not in a humour which
rendered him fit to encounter difficulties,
and &s;till le&s;s the vulgar &s;quabbles of a
place already crowded with gue&s;ts; yet
it was not without much oppo&s;ition that
he at length obtained a lodging for the
night. The pea&s;ant was not le&s;s anxious
for the accommodation of his hor&s;es;
and, when Ellena heard him declare,
that the animal, which the Confe&s;&s;or
had &s;o cruelly &s;purred, &s;hould have a
double feed, and a bed of &s;traw as high
as his head, if he him&s;elf went without
one, &s;he gave him, unnoticed by Sche|doni,
the only ducat &s;he had left.</P>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
<P>SCHEDONI pa&s;&s;ed the night without
&s;leep. The incident of the preceding
evening had not only renewed the agonies
of remor&s;e, but excited tho&s;e of pride
and apprehen&s;ion. There was &s;omething
in the conduct of the pea&s;ant towards
him, which he could not clearly under|&s;tand,
though his &s;u&s;picions were &s;ufficient
to throw his mind into a &s;tate of the
utmo&s;t perturbation. Under an air of extreme
&s;implicity, this man had talked of
Spalatro, had di&s;covered that he was ac|quainted
with much of his hi&s;tory, and
had hinted that he knew by whom he had
been employed; yet at the fame time ap|peared
<PB N="51" REF="52">
uncon&s;cious, that Schedoni's was
the ma&s;ter-hand, which had directed the
principal actions of the ruffian. At
other times, his behaviour had &s;eemed to
contradict the &s;uppo&s;ition of his igno|rance
on this point; from &s;ome circum|&s;tances
he had mentioned, it appeared
impo&s;&s;ible but that he must have known,
who Schedoni really was, and even his
own conduct had occa&s;ionally &s;eemed to
acknowledge this, particularly when, be|ing
interrupted in his hi&s;tory of Spalatro,
he attempted an apology, by &s;aying, he
did not know it concerned Schedoni:
nor could the con&s;cious Schedoni believe
that the very pointed manner, in which
the pea&s;ant had addre&s;&s;ed him at the re|pre&s;entation
of Virginia, was merely ac|cidental.
He wi&s;hed to di&s;mi&s;s the man
immediately, but it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to
a&s;certain what he knew concerning him,
and then to decide on the mea&s;ures to be
taken. It was, however, a difficult mat|er
<PB N="52" REF="53">
to obtain this information, without ma|nife&s;ting
an anxiety, which might betray
him, if the guide had, at pre&s;ent, only a
general &s;u&s;picion of the truth; and no
le&s;s difficult to determine how to proceed
towards him, if it &s;hould be evident that
his &s;u&s;picions re&s;ted on Spalatro. To
take him forward to Naples, was to bring
an informer to his home; to &s;uffer him
to return with his di&s;covery, now that he
probably knew the place of Schedoni's
re&s;idence, was little le&s;s hazardous. His
death only could &s;ecure the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>After a night pa&s;&s;ed in the tumult of
&s;uch con&s;iderations, the Confe&s;&s;or &s;um|moned
the pea&s;ant to his chamber, and,
with some &s;hort preface, told him he had
no further occa&s;ion for his &s;ervices, add|ing,
carele&s;sly, that he advi&s;ed him to be
on his guard as he re-pa&s;&s;ed the villa, le&s;t
Spalatro, who might yet lurk there,
&s;hould revenge upon him the injury he
had received. &startq;According to your ac|count
<PB N="53" REF="54">
of him, he is a very dangerous fel|low,&endq;
&s;aid Schedoni; &startq;but your infor|mation
is, perhaps, erroneous.&endq;</P>
<P>The guide began, te&s;tily, to ju&s;tify
himself for his a&s;&s;ertions, and the Con|fe&s;&s;or
then endeavoured to draw from him
what he knew on the &s;ubject. But, whe|ther
the man was piqued by the treat|ment
he had lately received, or had other
rea&s;ons for re&s;erve, he did not, at fir&s;t,
appear &s;o willing to communicate as for|merly.</P>
<P>&startq;What you hinted of this man,&endq;
&s;aid Schedoni, &startq;has, in &s;ome degree, ex|cited
my curio&s;ity: I have now a few mo|ments
of lei&s;ure, and you may relate, if
you will, &s;omething of the wonderful hi&s;|tory
you talked of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is a long &s;tory, Signor, and you
would be tired before I got to the end of
it,&endq; replied the pea&s;ant; &startq;and, craving
your pardon, Signor, I don't much like
to be &s;napped up &s;o!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">
&startq;Where did this man live?&endq; &s;aid the
Confe&s;&s;or. &startq;You mentioned &s;omething
of a hou&s;e at the &s;ea side.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, Signor, there is a &s;trange hi&s;|tory
belonging to that hou&s;e, too; but
this man, as I was &s;aying, came there
all of a &s;udden, nobody knew how! and
the place had been &s;hut up ever &s;ince the
Marche&s;e&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Marche&s;e!&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, cold|ly,
&startq;what Marche&s;e, friend?&endq;&mdash;&startq;Why,
I mean the Bar&oacute;ne di Cambru&s;ca, Signor,
to be &s;ure, as I was going to have told
you, of my own accord, if you would
only have let me. Shut up ever &s;ince
the Bar&oacute;ne&mdash;I left off there, I think.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tood that the Bar&oacute;ne was
dead!&endq; ob&s;erved the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signor,&endq; replied the pea&s;ant,
fixing his eyes on Schedoni; &startq;but what
has his death to do with what I was
telling? This happened before he died.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni, &s;omewhat di&s;concerted by
this unexpected remark, forgot to re|&s;ent
<PB N="55" REF="56">
the familiarity of it. &startq;This man
then, this Spalatro, was connected with
the Bar&oacute;ne di Cambru&s;ca?&endq; &s;aid he.</P>
<P>&startq;It. was pretty well gue&s;&s;ed &s;o, Sig|nor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How! no more than gue&s;&s;ed?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Signor, and that was more
than enough for the Bar&oacute;ne's liking, I
warrant. He took too much care for
any thing certain to appear again&s;t him,
and he was wi&s;e &s;o to do, for if it had
&mdash;it would have been wor&s;e for him.
But I was going to tell you the &s;tory,
Signor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What rea&s;ons were there for be|lieving
this was an agent of the Bar&oacute;ne
di Cambru&s;ca, friend?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I thought you wi&s;hed to hear the &s;tory,
Signor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In good time; but fir&s;t what were
your rea&s;ons?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;One of them is enough, Signor,
and if you would only have let me; gone
<PB N="56" REF="57">
&s;traight on with the &s;tory, you would
have found it out by this time, Signor.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni frowned, but did not other|wi&s;e
reprove the impertinence of the
&s;peech.</P>
<P>&startq;It was rea&s;on enough, Signor, to
my mind,&endq; continued the pea&s;ant, &startq;that
it was &s;uch a crime as nobody but the
Bar&oacute;ne di Cambru&s;ca could have com|mitted;
there was nobody wicked enough,
in our parts, to have done it but him.
Why is not this <HI>rea&s;on</HI> enough, Signor?
What makes you look at me &s;o? why
the Bar&oacute;ne him&s;elf could hardly have
looked wor&s;e, if I had told him as much!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Be le&s;s prolix,&endq; &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or,
in a re&s;trained voice.</P>
<P>&startq;Well then, Signor, to begin at the
beginning. It is a good many years ago
that Marco came first to our town. Now
the &s;tory goes, that one &s;tormy night&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You may &s;pare your&s;elf the trouble
of relating the &s;tory,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni,
<PB N="57" REF="58">
abruptly, &startq;Did you ever &s;ee the Ba|r&oacute;ne
you was &s;peaking of, friend?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why did you bid me tell it, Sig|nor,
&s;ince you know it already! I have
been here all this while, ju&s;t a-going to
begin it, and all for nothing!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is very &s;urpri&s;ing,&endq; re&s;umed the
artful Schedoni, without having noticed
what had been &s;aid, &startq;that if this Spa|latro
was known to be the villain you
&s;ay he is, not any &s;tep &s;hould have been
taken to bring him to ju&s;tice! how hap|pened
that? But, perhaps, all this &s;tory
was nothing more than a report.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, Signor, it was every body's
bu&s;ine&s;s, and nobody's, as one may &s;ay;
then, be&s;ides, nobody could prove what
they had heard, and though every body
believed the &s;tory ju&s;t the &s;ame as if they
had &s;een the whole, yet that, they &s;aid,
would, not do in law, but they &s;hould
be made to prove it. Now, it is not one
time in ten that any thing can be proved,
<PB N="58" REF="59">
Signor, as you well know, yet we none
of us believe it the le&s;s for that!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So, then, you would have had this
man puni&s;hed for a murder, which, pro|bably,
he never committed!&endq; &s;aid the
Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>&startq;A murder!&endq; repeated the pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;ilent, but, in the next
in&s;tant, &s;aid, &startq;Did you not &s;ay it was
a murder?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have not told you &s;o, Signor!</P>
<P>&startq;What was the crime, then?&endq; re|&s;umed
Schedoni, after another momentary
pau&s;e, you &s;aid it was atrocious, and what
more &s;o than&mdash;murder?&endq; His lip quivered
as he pronounced the la&s;t word.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ant made no. reply, but re|mained
with his eyes fixed upon the Con|fe&s;&s;or,
and, at length, repeated, &startq;Did I
&s;ay it was murder, Signor?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If it was not that, &s;ay what it was,&endq;
demanded the Confe&s;&s;or, haughtily; &startq;but
let it be in two words.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">
&startq;As if a &s;tory could be told in two
words, Signor!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well, be brief.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How can I, Signor, when the &s;tory
is &s;o long!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will wa&s;te no more time,&endq; &s;aid Sche|doni,
going.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Signor, I will do my be&s;t
to make it &s;hort. It was one &s;tormy night
in December, that Marco Torma had been
out fi&s;hing. Marco, Signor, was an old
man that lived in our town when I was a
boy; I can but ju&s;t remember him, but
my father knew him well, and loved old
Marco, and u&s;ed often to &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;To the &s;tory!&endq; &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Why I am telling it, Signor, as
fa&s;t as I can. This old Marco did not
live in our town, at the time it happened,
but in &s;ome place, I have forgot the name
of it, near the &s;ea &s;hore. What can the
name be! it is &s;omething like&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, what happened to this old
dotard?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">
&startq;You are out there, Signor, he was no
old dotard; but you &s;hall hear. At that
time, Signor, Marco lived in this place
that I have forgot the name of, and was
a fi&s;herman, but better times turned up
afterwards, but that is neither here nor
there, Old Marco had been out fi&s;hing;
it was a &s;tormy night, and he was glad
enough to get on &s;hore, I warrant. It
was quite dark, as dark, Signor, I &s;up|po&s;e,
as it was la&s;t night, and he was
making the be&s;t of his way, Signor, with
&s;ome fi&s;h along the &s;hore, but it being &s;o
dark, he lo&s;t it notwith&s;tanding. The
rain beat, and the wind blew, and he
wandered about a long while, and could
fee no light, nor hear any thing, but the
&s;urge near him, which &s;ometimes &s;eemed
as if it was coming to wa&s;h him away.
He got as far off it as he could, but he
knew there were high rocks, over the
beach, and he was afraid he &s;hould
run his head again&s;t them, if he went
<PB N="61" REF="62">
too far, I &s;uppo&s;e. However, at la&s;t,
he went up clo&s;e to them, and as he got
a little &s;helter, he re&s;olved to try no fur|ther
for the pre&s;ent. I tell it you, Sig|nor,
ju&s;t as my father told it me, and he
had it from the old man him&s;elf,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You need not be &s;o particular,&endq; re|plied
the Confe&s;&s;or; &startq;&s;peak to the point.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Signor, as old Marco lay &s;nug
under the rocks, he thought he heard
&s;omebody coming, and he lifted up his
head, I warrant, poor old &s;oul! as if he
could have &s;een who it was; however, he
could hear, though it was &s;o dark, and
he heard the &s;teps coming on; but he &s;aid
nothing yet, meaning to let them, come
clo&s;e up to him, before he di&s;covered him|&s;elf.
Pre&s;ently he &s;ees a little moving
light, and it comes nearer and nearer, till
it was ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to him, and then he
&s;aw the &s;hadow of a man on the ground,
and then &s;pied the man him&s;elf, with a
dark lanthorn, pa&s;&s;ing along the beach.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">
&startq;Well, well, to the purpo&s;e,&endq; &s;aid
Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Old Marco, Signor, my father &s;ays,
was never &s;tout-hearted, and he took it
into his head this might be a robber, be|cau&s;e
he had the lanthorn, though, for
that matter, he would have been glad
enough of a lanthorn him&s;elf, and &s;o he
lay quiet. But, pre&s;ently, he was in a
rare fright, for the man &s;topped to re&s;t the
load he had upon his back, on a piece of
rock near him, and old Marco &s;aw him
throw off a heavy &s;ack, and heard him
breathe hard, as if he was hugely tired.
I tell it, Signer, ju&s;t as my father does,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What was in the &s;ack?&endq; &s;aid Sche|doni,
coolly.</P>
<P>&startq;All in good time Signor;&endq; perhaps
old Marco never &s;ound out; but you &s;hall
hear. He was afraid, when he &s;aw the
&s;ack, to &s;tir a limb, for he thought it held
booty. But, pre&s;ently, the man, without
&s;aying a word, heaved it on his &s;houlders
<PB N="63" REF="64">
again, and &s;taggered away with it along
the beach, and Marco &s;aw no more of
him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well! what has he to do with your
&s;tory, then?&endq; &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, &startq;Was
this Spalatro?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All in good time, Signer; you put
me out. When the &s;torm was down, a
little, Marco crept out, and, thinking
there mu&s;t be a village, or a. hamlet, or a
cottage, at no great di&s;tance, &s;ince this
man had pa&s;&s;ed, he thought he would try
a little further. He had better have &s;taid
where he was, for he wandered about a
long while, and could &s;ee nothing, and
what was wor&s;e, the &s;torm came on louder
than before and he had no rocks to &s;helter
him now. While he was in this quan|dary,
he &s;ees a light at a di&s;tance and
it came into, his head this might be the
lantern again, but be determined to go
on notwith&s;tanding, for if it was, he
could &s;top &s;hort, and if it was not he
<PB N="64" REF="65">
&s;hould get &s;helter, perhaps; &s;o on he
went, and I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould have done
the &s;ame, Signor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well! this hi&s;tory never will have an
end!&endq; &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Well! Signor, he had not gone far
when he &s;ound out that it was no lantern,
but a light at a window. When he came
up to the hou&s;e he knocked &s;oftly at the
door, but nobody came.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What hou&s;e?&endq; inquired the Confe&s;&s;or,
&s;harply.</P>
<P>&startq;The rain beat hard, Signor, and I
warrant poor old Marco waited a long
time before he knocked again, for he was
main patient, Signor. O! how I have
&s;een him li&s;ten to a &s;tory, let it be ever &s;o
long!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have need of his patience!&endq; &s;aid
Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;When he knocked again, Signor,
the door gave way a little, and he &s;ound
it was open, and &s;o, as nobody came, he
thought fit to walk in of his own accord.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="66">
&startq;The dotard! what bu&s;ine&s;s had he to
be &s;o curious?&endq; exclaimed Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Curious! Signor, he only &s;ought
&s;helter! He &s;tumbled about in the dark,
for a good while, and could find nobody,
nor make nobody hear, but, at la&s;t, he
came to a room where there was &s;ome fire
not quite out, upon the hearth, and he
went up to it, to warm him&s;elf, till &s;ome|body
&s;hould come.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What! was there nobody in the
hou&s;e?&endq; &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;hall hear, Signor. He had not
been there, he &s;aid, no, he was &s;ure, not
above two minutes, when he heard, a
&s;trange &s;ort of a noi&s;e in the very room
where he was, but the fire gave &s;uch a poor
light, he could not &s;ee whether any body
was there.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What was the noi&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You put me out, Signor. He &s;aid
he did not much like it, but what could
he do! So he &s;tirred up the fire, and tried
<PB N="66" REF="67">
to make it blaze a little, but it was as
du&s;ky as ever; he could see nothing.
Pre&s;ently, however, he heard &s;omebody
coming, and &s;aw a light, and then a man
coming towards the room where he was,
&s;o he went up to him to a&s;k &s;helter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who was this man?&endq; &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;k &s;helter. He &s;ays the man, when
he came to the door of the room, turned
as white as a &s;heet, as well he might, to
&s;ee a &s;tranger, to find a &s;tranger there, at
that time of the night. I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould
have done the fame my&s;elf. The man
did not &s;eem very willing to let him &s;lay,
but a&s;ked what he did there, and &s;uch
like; but the &s;torm was very loud, and &s;o
Marco did not let a little matter daunt
him, and, when he &s;hewed the man
what fine fi&s;h he had in his ba&s;ket, and
&s;aid he was welcome to it, he &s;eemed more
willing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Incredible!&endq; exclaimed Schedoni,
&startq;the blockhead!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">
&startq;He had wit enough for that matter,
Signor; Marco &s;ays he appeared to be
main hungry&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is that any proof of his wit?&endq; &s;aid the
Confe&s;&s;or, peevi&s;hly.</P>
<P>&startq;You never will let me fini&s;h, Signor;
main hungry; for he put more wood on
the fire directly, to dre&s;s &s;ome of the fi&s;h.
While he was doing this, Marco &s;ays his
heart, &s;omehow, mi&s;gave him, that this
was the man he &s;aw on the beach, and he
looked at him pretty hard, till the other
a&s;ked him, cro&s;sly, what he &s;tared at him
&s;o for; but Marco took care not to tell.
While he was bu&s;y making ready the fi&s;h,
however, Marco had an opportunity of
eying him the more, and every time the
man looked round the room, which hap|pened
to be pretty often, he had a notion
it was the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, and if it was the &s;ame,&endq; &s;aid
Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;But when Marco happened to &s;py the
&s;ack, lying in a corner, he had no doubt
<PB N="68" REF="69">
about the matter. He &s;ays his heart then
mi&s;gave him &s;adly, and he wi&s;hed hlm&s;elf
&s;afe out of the hou&s;e, and determined, in
his own mind, to get away as &s;oon as he
could, without letting the man &s;u&s;pect what
he thought of him. He now gue&s;&s;ed,
too, what made the man look round the
room &s;o often, and, though Marco thought
before it was to find out if he had
brought any body with him, he now be|lieved
it was to &s;ee whether his trea&s;ure
was &s;afe.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, likely enough,&endq; ob&s;erved Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, old Marco &s;at not much at
his ea&s;e, while the fi&s;h was preparing,
and thought it was &startq;out of the fryingpan
into the fire&endq; with him; but what could
he do?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why get up and walk away, to be
&s;ure,&endq; &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, &startq;as I &s;hall do,
if your &s;tory la&s;ts much longer.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">
&startq;You &s;hall hear, Signor; he would
have done &s;o, if he had thought this man
would have let him, but&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, this man was Spalatro, I &s;up|po&s;e,&endq;
&s;aid Schedoni, impatiently, &startq;and
this was the hou&s;e on the &s;hore you for|merly
mentioned.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How well you have gue&s;&s;ed it,
Signor! though to &s;ay truth, I have been
expecting you to find it out for this half
hour.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni did not like the &s;ignificant
look, which the pca&s;ant a&s;&s;umed while he
&s;aid this, but he bade him proceed.</P>
<P>&startq;At fir&s;t, Signor, Spalatro hardly &s;poke
a word, but he came to by degrees,
and by the time the fi&s;h was nearly
ready, he was talkative enough.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the Confe&s;&s;or ro&s;e, with &s;ome emo|tion,
and paced the room.</P>
<P>&startq;Poor old Marco, Signor, began to
think better of him, and when he heard
the rain at the ca&s;ements, he was loath to
<PB N="70" REF="71">
think of &s;tirring. Pre&s;ently Spalatro went
out of the room for a plate to eat the fi&s;h
on.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Out of the room?&endq; &s;aid Schiedoni,
and checked his &s;teps.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signor, but he took care to
carry the light with him. However,
Marco, who had a deal of curio&s;ity
To&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, he appears to have had a great
deal, indeed!&endq; &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, and
turning away, renewed his pace.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, Signor, I am not come to that
yet, he has &s;hewn none, yet;&mdash;a great
deal of curio&s;ity to know what was in
the &s;ack, before he con&s;ented to let him|&s;elf
&s;tay much longer, thought this a
good opportunity for looking, and as the
fire was now pretty bright, he determined
to &s;ee. He went up to the &s;ack, there|fore,
Signor, and tried to lift it, but it
was too heavy for him though it did not
&s;eem full.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="72">
Schedoni again checked his &s;teps, and
&s;tood fixed before the pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>&startq;He raised it, however, a little, Signor,
but it fell from his hands, and with &s;uch
a heavy weight upon the floor, that he
was &s;ure it held no common booty. Ju&s;t
then, he &s;ays, he thought he heard Spala|tro
coming, and the &s;ound of the &s;ack
was enough to have frightened him, and
&s;o Marco quitted it; but he was mi&s;|taken,
and he went to it again. But you
don't &s;eem to hear me, Signor, for you
look as you do when you are in tho&s;e
quandaries, &s;o bu&s;y a-thinking, and
I&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Proceed,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, &s;ternly, and
renewed his &s;teps, &startq;I hear you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Went to it again,&endq;&mdash;re&s;umed the
pea&s;ant, cautiou&s;ly taking up the &s;tory at
the la&s;t words he had dropped. &startq;He un|tied
the &s;tiring, Signor, that held the &s;ack,
and opened the cloth a little way, but
think, Signor, what he mu&s;t have thought,
<PB N="72" REF="73">
when he felt&mdash;cold fle&s;h! O, Signor!
and when he &s;aw by the light of the fire,
the face of a corp&s;e within! O, Signor!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>The pea&s;ant, in the eagerne&s;s with
which he related this circum&s;tance, had
followed Schedoni to the other end of
the chamber, and he now took hold of
his garment, as if to &s;ecure his attention to
the remainder of the &s;tory. The Con|fe&s;&s;or,
however, continued his &s;teps, and
the pea&s;ant kept pace with him, &s;till
loo&s;ely holding his garment.</P>
<P>&startq;Marco,&endq; he re&s;umed, &startq;was &s;o ter|rified,
as my father &s;ays, that he hardly
knew where he was, and I warrant, if
one could have &s;een him, he looked as
white, Signor, as you do now.&endq;</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or abruptly withdrew his
garment from the pea&s;ant's gra&s;p, and
&s;aid, in an inward voice, &startq;If I am
&s;hocked at the mere mention of &s;uch a
&s;pectacle, no wonder he was, who be|held
it!&endq; After the pau&s;e of a moment,
he added,&mdash;&startq;But what followed?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
&startq;Marco &s;ays he had no power to tie
up the cloth again, Signor, and when he
came to his thoughts, his only fear was,
le&s;t Spalatro &s;hould return, though he had
hardly been gone a minute, before he
could get out of the hou&s;e, for he cared
nothing about the &s;torm now. And &s;ure
enough he heard him coming, but he
managed to get out of the room, into a
pa&s;&s;age another way from that Spalatro
was in. And luckily, too, it was the &s;ame
pa&s;&s;age he had come in by, and it led
him out of the hou&s;e. He made no more
ado, but ran &s;traight off, without &s;top|ping
to chu&s;e which way, and many perils
and dangers he got into among the woods,
that night, and&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How happened it, that this Spalatro
was not taken up, after this di&s;covery!&endq;
&s;aid Schedoni. &startq;What was the con|&s;equence
of it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, Signor, old Marco had like to
have caught his death that night; what
<PB N="74" REF="75">
with the wet, and what with the fright,
he was laid up with a fever, and was
light-headed, and raved of &s;uch &s;trange
things, that people would not believe
any thing he &s;aid when he came to his
&s;en&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, &startq;the narrative
re&s;embles a delirious dream, more than
a reality; I perfectly accord with them in
their opinion of this feveri&s;h old man.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But you &s;hall hear, Signor; after a
while they began to think better of it,
and there was &s;ome &s;tir made about it;
but what could poor folks do, for nothing
could be proved! The hou&s;e was &s;earched,
but the man was gone, and nothing
could be &s;ound! From that time the place
was &s;hut up; till many years after, this
Spalatro appeared, and old Marco then
&s;aid He was pretty &s;ure he was the man,
but he could not &s;wear it, and &s;o nothing
could be done.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Then it appears, after all, that you
are not certain that this long hi&s;tory be|longs
<PB N="75" REF="76">
to this Spalatro!&endq; &s;aid the Con|fe&s;&s;or;
&startq;nay, not even that the hi&s;tory
it&s;elf is any thing more than the vi&s;ion of
a di&s;tempered brain!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I do not know, Signor, what you
may call certain; but I know what we all
believe. But the &s;trange&s;t part of the
&s;tory is to come yet, and that which no|body
would believe, hardly, if&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have heard enough,&endq; &s;aid Sche|doni,
&startq;I will hear no more!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well but, Signor, I have not told
you half yet; and I am &s;ure when I heard
it my&s;elf, it &s;o terrified me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have li&s;tened too long to this idle
hi&s;tory,&endq; &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, &startq;there &s;eem&s;
to be no rational foundation for it. Here
is what I owe you; you may depart.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Signor, 'tis plain you know
the re&s;t already, or you never would go
without it. But you don't know, per|haps,
Signor, what an unaccountable&mdash;I
am &s;ure it made my hair &s;tand on end to
hear of it, what an unaccountable&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="77">
&startq;I will hear no more of this ab&s;ur|dity,&endq;
interrupted Schedoni, with &s;tern|ne&s;s.
&startq;I reproach my&s;elf for having
li&s;tened &s;o long to &s;uch a go&s;&s;ip's tale,
and have no further curio&s;ity concerning
it. You may withdraw; and bid the ho&s;t
attend me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Signor, if you are &s;o ea&s;ily
&s;atisfied,&endq; replied the pea&s;ant, with di&s;ap|pointment,
&startq;there is no more to be &s;aid,
but&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You may &s;tay, however, while I
caution you,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni, &startq;how you
pa&s;s the villa, where this Spalatro may
yet linger, for, though I can only &s;mile
at the &s;tory you have related&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Related, Signor! why I have not
told it half; and if you would only plea&s;e
to be patient&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Though I can only &s;mile at that
&s;imple narrative,&endq;&mdash;repeated Schedoni in
a louder tone.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78">
&startq;Nay, Signor, for that matter, you can
&s;rown at it too, as I can te&s;tify,&endq; muttered
the guide.</P>
<P>&startq;Li&s;ten to me!&endq; &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, in
a yet more in&s;i&s;ting voice. &startq;I &s;ay, that
though I give no credit to your curious
hi&s;tory, I think this &s;ame Spalatro appears
to be a de&s;perate fellow, and, therefore,
I would have you be on your guard. If
you &s;ee him, you may depend upon it,
that he will attempt your life in revenge
of the injury I have done him. I give
you, therefore, in addition to your trom|bone,
this &s;tiletto to defend you.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni, while he &s;poke, took an in|&s;trument
from his bo&s;om, but it was not
the one he u&s;ually wore, or, at lea&s;t, that
he was &s;een to wear. He delivered it to
the pea&s;ant, who received it with a kind
of &s;tupid &s;urpri&s;e, and then gave him,
&s;ome directions as to the way in which it
&s;hould be managed.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, Signor,&endq; &s;aid the man, who
had li&s;tened with much attention, &startq;I am
<PB N="78" REF="79">
kindly obliged to you for thinking about
me, but is there any thing in this &s;tiletto
different from others, that it is to be u&s;ed
&s;o?&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni looked gravely at the pea&s;ant
for an in&s;tant, and then replied, &startq;Cer|tainly
not, friend, I would only in&s;truct
you to u&s;e it to the best advantage;&mdash;
farewell!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thank you kindly, Signor, but&mdash;but
I think I have no need of it, my trombone
is enough for me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This will defend you more adroitly,&endq;
replied Schedoni, refu&s;ing to take back
the &s;tiletto, &startq;and moreover, while you
were loading the trombone, your adver|&s;ary
might u&s;e his poniard to advantage.
Keep it, therefore, friend; it will protect
you better than a dozen trombones. Put
it up.&endq;</P>
<P>Perhaps it was Schedoni's particular
look, more than his argument, that con|vinced
the guide of the value of his gift;
<PB N="79" REF="80">
he received it &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, though with a
&s;tare of &s;tupid &s;urpri&s;e; probably it had
been better, if it had been &s;u&s;picious &s;ur|pri&s;e.
He thanked Schedoni again, and
was leaving the room, when the Confe&s;&s;or
called out, &startq;Send the landlord to me
immediately, I &s;hall &s;et off for Rome
without delay!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signor,&endq; replied the pea&s;ant,
&startq;you are at the right place, the road parts
here; but I thought you was going for
Naples!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For Rome,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;For Rome, Signor! Well, I hope
you will get &s;afe, Signor, with all my
heart!&endq; &s;aid the guide, and quitted the
chamber.</P>
<P>While this dialogue had been pa&s;&s;ing
between Schedoni and the pea&s;ant, Ellena,
in &s;olitude, was con&s;idering on the means
of prevailing with the Confe&s;&s;or to allow
her to return either to Altieri, or to the
neighbouring cloi&s;ter of &startq;<HI>Our Lady of
<PB N="80" REF="81">
Pity,</HI>&endq; in&s;tead of placing her at a di&s;tance
from Naples, till he &s;hould think proper
to acknowledge her. The plan, which he
had mentioned, &s;eemed to her long-har|ra&s;&s;ed
mind to exile her forever from happi|ne&s;s.
and all that was dear to her affections;
it appeared like a &s;econd bani&s;hment to
San S$efano. and every abbe&s;s, except
that of the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI> came to her
imagination in the portraiture of an in|exorable
jailor. While this &s;ubject en|gaged
her, &s;he was &s;ummoned to attend
Schedoni, whom &s;he found impatient to
enter the carriage, which at this town they
had been able to procure. Ellena, on
looking out for the guide, was informed
that he had already &s;et off for his home,
a circum&s;tance, for the &s;uddenne&s;s of
which &s;he knew not how to account.</P>
<P>The travellers immediately proceeded on
their journey; Schedoni, reflecting on the
late conver&s;ation, &s;aid little, and Ellena
read not in his countenance any thing that
<PB N="81" REF="82">
might encourage her to introduce the
&s;ubject of her own intended &s;olicitation.
Thus &s;eparately occupied, they advanced,
during &s;ome hours, on the road to Naples,
for thither Schedoni had de&s;igned to go,
notwith&s;tanding his late a&s;&s;ertion to the
guide, whom it appears, for whatever
rea&s;on, he was anxious to deceive, as to
the place of his actual re&s;idence.</P>
<P>They &s;topped to dine at a town of &s;ome
con&s;ideration, and, when Ellena heard
the Confe&s;&s;or inquire concerning the nu|merous
convents it contained, &s;he per|ceived
that it was nece&s;&s;ary for her no
longer to defer her petition. She there|fore
repre&s;ented immediately what mu&s;t
be the forlornne&s;s of her &s;tate, and the
anxiety of her mind, if &s;he were placed
at a di&s;tance from the &s;cenes and the
people, which affection and early habit
&s;eemed to have con&s;ecrated; e&s;pecially at
this time, when her &s;pirits had &s;carcely
recovered from the &s;evere pre&s;&s;ure of long-&s;uffering,
<PB N="82" REF="83">
and when to &s;oothe and renovate
them, not only quiet, but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of &s;ecurity, were nece&s;&s;ary; a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
which it was impo&s;&s;ible, and e&s;pecially &s;o
after her late experience, that &s;he could
acquire among &s;trangers, till they &s;hould
cea&s;e to be &s;uch.</P>
<P>To the&s;e pleadings Schedoni thought|fully
attended, but the darkne&s;s of his
a&s;pect did not indicate that his com|pa&s;&s;ion
was touched; and Ellena pro|ceeded
to repre&s;ent, &s;econdly, that which,
had &s;he been more artful, or le&s;s di&s;dain|ful
of cunning, &s;he would have urged the
fir&s;t. As it was, &s;he had begun with the
mention of circum&s;tances, which, though
the lea&s;t likely to prevail with Schedoni,
&s;he felt to be mo&s;t important to her&s;elf;
and &s;he concluded with representing that,
which was mo&s;t intere&s;ting to him. Ellena
&s;ugge&s;ted, that her re&s;idence in the neigh|bourhood
of Altieri might be &s;o managed,
as that his &s;ecret would be as effectually
<PB N="83" REF="84">
pre&s;erved, as if &s;he were at an hundred
miles from Naples.</P>
<P>It may appear extraordinary, that a
man of Schedoni's habitual coolne&s;s, and
exact calculation, &s;hould have &s;uffered
fear, on this occa&s;ion, to ob&s;cure his per|ceptions;
and this in&s;tance &s;trongly proved
the magnitude of the cau&s;e, which could
produce &s;o powerful an effect. While he
now li&s;tened to Ellena, he began to per|ceive
circum&s;tances that had eluded his
own ob&s;ervation; and he, at length, ac|knowledged,
that it might be &s;afer to per|mit
her to return to the Villa Altieri, and
that &s;he &s;hould from thence go, as &s;he had
formerly intended, to the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI>
than to place her in any convent, however
remote, where it would, be nece&s;&s;ary for
him&s;elf to introduce her. His only re|maining
objection to the neighbourhood
of Naples, now re&s;ted on the chance it
would offer the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi of di&s;|covering
Ellena's abode, before he &s;hould
<PB N="84" REF="85">
judge it convenient to di&s;clo&s;e to her his
family; and his knowledge of the Mar|che&s;a
ju&s;tified his mo&s;t horrible &s;u&s;picion,
as to the con&s;equence of &s;uch a premature
di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Something, however, it appeared, mu&s;t
be ri&s;ked in any &s;ituation he might
chu&s;e for Ellena; and her re&s;idence at
the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI> a large convent,
well &s;ecured, and where, as &s;he had
been known to them from her infancy,
the abbe&s;s and the &s;i&s;ters might be &s;up|po&s;ed
to be not indifferent concerning
her welfare, &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;ecurity
again&s;t any actual violence from the
malice of the Marche&s;a; again&s;t her
artful duplicity every place would be
almo&s;t equally in&s;ufficient. Here, as
Ellena would appear in the character &s;he
had always been known in, no curio&s;ity
could be excited, or &s;u&s;picion awakened,
as to her family; and here, therefore,
Schedoni's &s;ecret would more probably be
<PB N="85" REF="86">
pre&s;erved, than el&s;ewhere. As this was,
after all, the predominant &s;ubject of his
anxiety, to which, however unnatural it
may &s;eem, even the &s;afety of Ellena was
&s;econdary, he finally determined, that
&s;he &s;hould return to the <HI>Santa della Pi|eta;</HI>
and &s;he thanked him almo&s;t with
tears, for a con&s;ent which &s;he received
as a generous indulgence, but which was
in reality little more than an effect of
&s;elfi&s;h apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The remainder of the journey, which
was of &s;ome days, pa&s;&s;ed without any
remarkable occurrence: Schedoni, with
only &s;hort intervals, was &s;till enveloped,
in gloom and &s;ilence; and Ellena, with
thoughts engaged by the one &s;ubject of
her intere&s;t, the pre&s;ent &s;ituation and
circum&s;tances of Vivaldi, willingly &s;ub|mitted
to this prolonged &s;tillne&s;s.</P>
<P>As, at length, &s;he drew near Naples,
her emotions became more various and
powerful; and, when &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="86" REF="87">
the top of Ve&s;uvius peering over every
intervening &s;ummit, &s;he wept as her ima|gination
charactered all the well-known
country it overlooked. But when, hav|ing
reached an eminence, that &s;cenery
was exhibited to her &s;en&s;es, when the Bay
of Naples, &s;tretching into remote&s;t di&s;tance,
was &s;pread out before her; when every
mountain of that magnificent horizon,
which enclo&s;ed her native land&s;cape, that
country which &s;he believed Vivaldi to
inhabit, &s;tood unfolded, how affecting,
how overwhelming were her &s;en&s;ations!
Every object &s;eemed to &s;peak of her
home, of Vivaldi, and of happine&s;s that
was pa&s;&s;ed! and &s;o exqui&s;itely did regret
mingle with hope, the tender grief of
remembrance with the intere&s;t of expec|tation,
that it were difficult to &s;ay which
prevailed.</P>
<P>Her expre&s;&s;ive countenance di&s;clo&s;ed to
the Confe&s;&s;or the cour&s;e of her thoughts
and of her feelings, feelings which, while
<PB N="87" REF="88">
he contemned, he believed he perfectly
comprehended, but of which, having
never in any degree experienced them, he
really under&s;tood nothing. The callous
Schedoni, by a mi&s;take not uncommon,
e&s;pecially to a mind of his character,
&s;ub&s;tituted words for truths; not only
confounding the limits of neighbouring
qualities, but mi&s;taking their very prin|ciples.
Incapable of perceiving their
nice di&s;tinctions, he called the per&s;ons
who &s;aw them, merely fanciful; thus
making his very incapacity an argument
for his &s;uperior wi&s;dom. And, while he
confounded delicacy of feeling with fa|tuity
of mind, ta&s;te with caprice, and
imagination with error, he yielded, when
he mo&s;t congratulated him&s;elf on his &s;a|gacity,
to illu&s;ions not le&s;s egregious, be|cau&s;e
they were le&s;s brilliant, than tho&s;e
which are incident to &s;entiment and feel|ing</P>
<P>The better to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, Sche|doni
had contrived not to reach Naples
<PB N="88" REF="89">
till the clo&s;e of evening, and it was en|tirely
dark before the carriage &s;topped at
the gate of the Villa Altieri. Ellena, with
a mixture of melancholy and &s;atisfaction,
viewed, once more, her long-de&s;erted
home, and while &s;he waited till a &s;ervant
&s;hould open the gate, remembered how
often &s;he had thus waited when there was
a beloved friend within, to welcome her
with &s;miles, which were now gone for
ever. Beatrice, the old hou&s;ekeeper, at
length, however, appeared, and received
her with an affection as &s;incere, if not as
&s;trong, as that of the relative for whom
&s;he mourned.</P>
<P>Here Schedoni alighted, and, having
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the carriage, entered the hou&s;e,
for the purpo&s;e of relinquishing al&s;o. his
di&s;gui&s;e, and re&s;uming his monk's habit.
Before he departed, Ellena ventured to
mention Vivaldi, and to expre&s;s her wi&s;h
to hear of his exact &s;ituation; but,
though Schedoni was too well enabled to
<PB N="89" REF="90">
inform her of it, the policy which had
hitherto kept him &s;ilent on this &s;ubject
&s;till influenced him; and he replied only,
that if he &s;hould happen to learn the
circum&s;tances of his condition, &s;he &s;hould
not remain ignorant of them.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;urance revived Ellena, for two
rea&s;ons; it afforded her a hope of relief
from her pre&s;ent uncertainty, and it al&s;o
&s;eemed to expre&s;s an approbation of the
object of her affection, &s;uch as the Con|fe&s;&s;or
had never yet di&s;clo&s;ed. Schedoni
added, that he &s;hould &s;ee her no more,
till he thought proper to acknowledge
her for his daughter; but that, if cir|cum&s;tances
made it nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;hould,
in the mean time, write to her; and he
now gave her a direction by which to
addre&s;s him under a fictitious name, and
at a place remote from his convent. El|lena,
though a&s;&s;ured of the nece&s;&s;ity for
this conduct, could not yield to &s;uch di&s;|gui&s;e,
without an aver&s;ion that was
<PB N="90" REF="91">
&s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in her manner, but of
which Schedoni took no notice. He bade
her, as &s;he valued her existence, watch|fully
to pre&s;erve the &s;ecret of her birth;
and to wa&s;te not a &s;ingle day at Villa Al|tieri,
but to retire to the <HI>Santa della Pieta;</HI>
and the&s;e injunctions were delivered in a
manner &s;o &s;olemn and energetic, as not
only deeply to impre&s;s upon her mind the
nece&s;&s;ity of fulfilling them, but to excite
&s;ome degree of amazement.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort and general direction re|&s;pecting
her further conduct, Schedoni
bade her farewell, and, privately quitting
the villa, in his eccle&s;ia&s;tical dre&s;s, re|paired
to the Dominican convent, which
he entered as a brother returned from a
di&s;tant pilgrimage. He was received as
u&s;ual by the &s;ociety, and found him&s;elf,
once more, the au&s;tere father Schedoni
of the Spirito Santo.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of his fir&s;t anxiety was the
nece&s;&s;ity for ju&s;tifying him&s;elf to the
<PB N="91" REF="92">
Marche&s;a di Vivaldi, for a&s;certaining
how much he might venture to reveal of
the truth, and for e&s;timating what would
be her deci&s;ion, were &s;he informed of the
whole. His &s;econd &s;tep would be to ob|tain
the relea&s;e of Vivaldi; and, as his
conduct in this in&s;tance would be regu|lated,
in a great degree, by the re&s;ult of
his conference with the Marche&s;a, it
would be only the &s;econd. However,
painful it mu&s;t be to Schedoni to meet
her, now that he had di&s;covered the
depth of the guilt, in which &s;he would
have involved him, he determined to &s;eek
this eventful conference on the following
morning: and he pa&s;&s;ed this night partly
in unea&s;y expectation of the approaching
day, but chiefly in inventing circum|&s;tances
and arranging arguments, that
might bear him triumphantly towards the
accomplishment of his grand de&s;ign.</P>

<P>SCHEDONI, on his way to the Vivaldi
palace, again reviewed and arranged every
argument, or rather. &s;pecious circum|&s;tance,
which might induce the Marche|&s;a's
con&s;ent to the nuptials he &s;o much de|&s;ired;
His family was noble, though no
longer wealthy, and he believed that as
the &s;eeming want of de&s;cent had hitherto
been the chief objection to Ellena, the
Marche&s;a might be prevailed with to
overlook the wreck of his fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="94">
At the palace he was told, that the
Marche&s;a was at one of her villas on the
bay; and he was too anxious not to
follow her thither immediately. This de|lightful
re&s;idence was &s;ituated on an airy
promontory, that overhung the water,
and was nearly embo&s;omed among the
woods, that &s;pread far along the heights,
and de&s;cended, with great pomp of foli|age
and colouring, to the very margin of
the waves. It &s;eemed &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible
that mi&s;ery could inhabit &s;o enchanting
an abode; yet the Marche&s;a was wretched
amid&s;t all the&s;e luxuries of nature and
art, which would have perfected the hap|pine&s;s
of an innocent mind. Her heart
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by evil pa&s;&s;ions, and all her
perceptions were di&s;torted and di&s;coloured
by them, which, like a dark magician,
had power to change the faire&s;t &s;cenes
into tho&s;e of gloom and de&s;olation.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants had orders to admit father
Schedoni at all times, and he was &s;hewn
<PB N="94" REF="95">
into a &s;aloon, in which the Marche&s;a was
alone. Every object in this apartment
announced ta&s;te, and even magnificence.
The hangings were of purple and gold;
the vaulted cieling was de&s;igned by one
of the fir&s;t painters of the Venetian
&s;chool; the marble &s;tatues that adorned
the rece&s;&s;es were not le&s;s exqui&s;ite, and
the whole &s;ymmetry and architecture, airy,
yet rich; gay, yet cha&s;tened; re&s;embled
the palace of a fairy, and &s;eemed to po&s;|&s;e&s;s
almo&s;t equal fa&s;cinations. The lat|tices
were thrown open, to admit the pro|&s;pect,
as well as the air loaded with fra|grance
from an orangery, that &s;pread before
them. Lo&s;ty palms and plantains threw
their green and refre&s;hing tint over the
windows, and on the lawn that &s;loped to
the edge of the precipice, a &s;hadowy
per&s;pective, beyond which appeared the
ample waters of the gulf, where the light
fails of feluccas, and the &s;preading canvas
of larger ve&s;&s;els, glided upon the &s;cene
<PB N="95" REF="96">
and pa&s;&s;ed away, as in a camera ob&s;cura.
Ve&s;uvius and the city of Naples were &s;een
on the coa&s;t beyond,- with many a bay
and lofty cape of that long tract of bold
and gaily-coloured &s;cenery, which ex|tends
toward Cape Campanella, crowned
by fading ranges of mountains, lighted
up with, all the magic of Italian &s;un&s;hine.
The Marche&s;a reclined on a &s;ofa before
an open lattice; her eyes were fixed up|on
the pro&s;pect without, but her attention
was wholly occupied by the vi&s;ions that
evil pa&s;&s;ions painted to her imagination.
On her &s;till beautiful features was the
languor of di&s;content and indi&s;po&s;ition;
and, though her manners, like her dre&s;s,
di&s;played the elegant negligence of the
graces, they concealed the movements of
a careful, and even a tortured heart. On
perceiving Schedoni, a faint &s;mile light|ened
upon her countenance, and &s;he held
forth her hand to him; at the touch of
which he &s;huddered.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97">
&startq;My good father, I rejoice to &s;ee
you,&endq; &s;aid the Marche&s;a; &startq;I have felt
the want of your conver&s;ation much,
and at this moment of indi&s;po&s;ition e&s;pe|cially.&endq;</P>
<P>She waved the attendant to withdraw;
while Schedoni, &s;talking to a window,
could with difficulty conceal the pertur|bation
with which he now, for the fir&s;t
time, con&s;ciou&s;ly beheld the willing de|&s;troyer
of his child. Some farther com|pliment
from the Marche&s;a recalled him;
he &s;oon recovered all his addre&s;s, and ap|proaching
her, &s;aid,</P>
<P>&startq;Daughter! you always &s;end me
away a wor&s;e Dominican than I come;
I approach you with humility, but de|part
elated with pride, and am obliged
to &s;uffer much from &s;elf-infliction before
I can de&s;cend to my proper level.&endq;</P>
<P>After &s;ome other flatteries had been
exchanged, a &s;ilence of &s;everal moments
followed, during which neither of the
<PB N="97" REF="98">
parties &s;eemed to have &s;ufficient courage
to introduce the &s;ubjects that engaged
their thoughts, &s;ubjects upon which their
intere&s;ts were now &s;o directly and unex|pectedly
oppo&s;ite. Had Schedoni been
le&s;s occupied by his own feelings, he
might have perceived the extreme agita|tion
of the Marche&s;a, the tremor of her
nerves, the faint flu&s;h that cro&s;&s;ed her
cheek, the wanne&s;s that &s;ucceeded, the
languid movement of her eyes, and the
laborious &s;ighs that interrupted her breath|ing,
while &s;he wi&s;hed, yet dared not a&s;k,
whether Ellena was no more, and averted
her regards from him, whom &s;he almo&s;t
believed to be a murderer.</P>
<P>Schedoni, not le&s;s affected, though ap|parently
tranquil, as &s;edulou&s;ly avoided
the face of the Marche&s;a, whom he con|&s;idered
with a degree of contempt almo&s;t
equal to his indignation: his feelings had
rever&s;ed, for the pre&s;ent, all his opinions
on the &s;ubject of their former arguments,
<PB N="98" REF="99">
and had taught him, for once, to think
ju&s;tly. Every moment of &s;ilence now
increa&s;ed his embarra&s;&s;ment, and his re|luctance
even to name Ellena. He
feared to tell that &s;he lived, yet de&s;pi&s;ed
him&s;elf for &s;uffering &s;uch fear, and &s;hud|dered
at a recollection of the conduct,
which had made any a&s;&s;urance concerning
her. life nece&s;&s;ary. The infinuations,
that he had discovered her family to be
&s;uch as would not degrade that of the
Marche&s;a, he knew not how to intro|duce
with &s;uch delicacy of gradation as
might win upon the jealou&s;y of her
pride, and &s;oothe her di&s;appointment; and
he was &s;till meditating how he might
lead to this &s;ubject, when the Marche&s;a
her&s;elf broke the &s;ilence.</P>
<P>&startq;Father&endq; &s;he &s;aid, with a &s;igh, &startq;I
always look to you for con&s;olation, and
am &s;eldom di&s;appointed. You are too
well acquainted with the anxiety which
has long oppre&s;&s;ed me; may I under&s;tand
<PB N="99" REF="100">
that the cau&s;e of it is removed?&endq; She
pau&s;ed, and then added, &startq;May I hope
that my &s;on will no longer be led from
the ob&s;ervance of his duty?&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni, with his eyes fixed on the
ground, remained &s;ilent, but, at length,
&s;aid, &startq;The chief occa&s;ion of your anx|iety
is certainly removed;&endq;&mdash;and he was
again &s;ilent.</P>
<P>&startq;How!&endq; exclaimed &s;he Marche&s;a,
with the quick-&s;ightedne&s;s of &s;u&s;picion,
while all her di&s;&s;imulation yielded to the
urgency of her fear, &startq;Have you failed?
Is &s;he not dead?&endq;</P>
<P>In the earne&s;tne&s;s of the que&s;tion, &s;he
fixed her eyes on Schedoni's face, and,
perceiving there &s;ymptoms of extraordi|nary
emotion, added, &startq;Relieve me from
my apprehen&s;ions, good father, I en|treat;
tell me that you have &s;ucceeded,
and that &s;he has paid the debt of ju&s;|tice.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni rai&s;ed his eyes to the Mar|che&s;a,
but in&s;tantly averted them; indigo|nation
<PB N="100" REF="101">
had lifted them, and di&s;gu&s;t and
&s;tifled horror turned them away. Though
very little of the&s;e feelings appeared, the
Marche&s;a perceived &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion as &s;he
had never been accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve in
his countenance; and, her &s;urprize and
impatience increasing, &s;he once more re|peated
the que&s;tion, and with a yet more
deci&s;ive air than before.</P>
<P>&startq;I have not failed in the grand ob|jecct&endq;
replied Schedoni: &startq;Your &s;on is
no longer in danger of forming a di&s;|graceful
alliance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In what, then, have you. failed?&endq;
a&s;ked the Marche&s;a; &startq;for I perceive
that you have not been completely &s;uc|ce&s;sful.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I ought not to &s;ay that I have failed
in any re&s;pect,&endq; replied Schedoni, with
emotion, &startq;&s;ince the honour of your
hou&s;e is pre&s;erved, and&mdash;a life is
spared.&endq;</P>
<P>His voice faultered as he pronounced
the la&s;t words, and he &s;eemed to experi|ence
<PB N="101" REF="102">
again the horror of that moment,
when, with an uplifted poniard in his
gra&s;p, he had di&s;covered Ellena for his
daughter.</P>
<P>&startq;Spared!&endq; repeated the Marche&s;a,
doubtingly; &startq;explain your&s;elf, good fa|ther!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She lives,&endq; replied Schedoni; &startq;but
you have nothing, therefore, to appre|hend.&endq;</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, &s;urprized no le&s;s by the
tone in which he &s;poke, than &s;hocked at
the purport of his words, changed coun|tenance,
while &s;he &s;aid, impatiently&mdash;
&startq;You &s;peak in enigmas, father.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lady! I &s;peak plain truth&mdash;&s;he
lives.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tand that &s;ufficiently,&endq; &s;aid
the Marche&s;a; &startq;but when you tell me,
I have nothing to apprehend&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I tell you truth, al&s;o,&endq; rejoined the
Confe&s;&s;or; &startq;and the benevolence of your
nature may be permitted to rejoice, for
<PB N="102" REF="103">
ju&s;tice no longer has forbade the exer|ci&s;e
of mercy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is all very well in its place,&endq;
&s;aid the Marche&s;a, betrayed by the vexa|tion
&s;he &s;uffered; &startq;&s;uch &s;entiments and
&s;uch compliments are like gala &s;uits, to be
put on in fine weather. My day is
cloudy; let me have a little plain &s;trong
&s;en&s;e: inform me of the circum&s;tances
which have occa&s;ioned this change in the
cour&s;e of your ob&s;ervations, and, good
father! be brief.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni then unfolded, with his u&s;ual
art, &s;uch circum&s;tances relative to the fa|mily
of Ellena as he hoped would &s;often
the aver&s;ion of the Marche&s;a to the
connection, and incline her, in con&s;ide|ration
of her &s;on's happine&s;s, finally to
approve it; with which di&s;clo&s;ure he
mingled a plau&s;ible relation of the way,
in which the di&s;covery had been made.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a's patience would &s;carcely
await the conclu&s;ion of his narrative, or
<PB N="103" REF="104">
her di&s;appointment &s;ubmit to the curb of
di&s;cretion. When, at length, he had
fini&s;hed his hi&s;tory, &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, with fretful di&s;plea&s;ure, &startq;that
you have &s;uffered your&s;elf to be de|ceived
by the plau&s;ibility of a girl, who
might have been expected to utter any
fal&s;hood, which &s;hould appear likely to
protect her! Has a man of your di&s;|cernment
given faith to the idle and im|probable
tale! Say, rather, father, that
your re&s;olution failed in the critical mo|ment,
and that you are now anxious to

<P>&startq;I am not apt to give an ea&s;y faith to

&startq;and &s;till le&s;s, to &s;hrink from the per|formance
of any act, which. I judge to be
nece&s;&s;ary and ju&s;t. To the la&s;t intima|tion,
I make no reply; it does not be|come
my character to vindicate my&s;elf
from an implication, of fal&s;hood.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105">
The Marche&s;a, perceiving that her pa&s;|&s;ion
had betrayed her into imprudence,
conde&s;cended to apologize for that which
&s;he termed an effect of her extreme anx|iety,
as to what might follow from an
act of &s;uch indi&s;creet indulgence; and
Schedoni as willingly accepted the apo|logy,
each believing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
other nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Schedoni then informed her, that he
had better authority for what he had ad|vanced
than the a&s;&s;ertion of Ellena; and
he mentioned &s;ome circum&s;tances, which
proved him to be more anxious for the
reputation than for the truth of his. word.
Believing that his origin was entirely un|known
to the Marche&s;a, he ventured to
di&s;clo&s;e &s;ome particulars of Ellena's fa|mily,
without apprehending that it could
lead to a &s;u&s;picion of his own.</P>
<P>&startq;The Marche&s;a, though neither appea&s;ed
or convinced, commanded her feelings &s;o
far as to appear tranquil, while the Con|fe&s;&s;or
<PB N="105" REF="106">
repre&s;ented, with the mo&s;t delicate
addre&s;s, the unhappine&s;s of her &s;on, and
the &s;atisfaction, which mu&s;t finally re&s;ult
to her&s;elf from an acquie&s;cence with his
choice, &s;ince the object of it was known
to be worthy of his alliance. He added,
that, while he had believed the contrary,
he had proved him&s;elf as &s;trenuous to
prevent, as he was now &s;incere in approv|ing
their marriage; and concluded with
gently blaming her for &s;uffering prejudice
and &s;ome remains, of re&s;entment to ob|&s;cure
her excellent under&s;tanding. &startq;Tru&s;t|ing
to the natural clearne&s;s of your per|ceptions,&endq;
he added, &startq;I doubt not that
when you have maturely con&s;idered the
&s;ubject, every, objection, will yield to a
con&s;ideration of your, &s;on's happine&s;s&endq;</P>
<P>The earne&s;tne&s;s, with which Schedoni
pleaded, for Vivaldi, excited &s;ome &s;ur|prize;
but the Marche&s;a, without conde|&s;cending
to reply either to his argument
or remon&s;trance, inquired whether El|lena.
<PB N="106" REF="107">
had a &s;u&s;picion of the de&s;ign, with
which &s;he had been carried into the fore&s;ts
of the Garganus, or concerning the iden|tity
of her per&s;ecutor. Schedoni, imme|diately
perceiving to what the&s;e que&s;tions
tended, replied, with the facility with
which he u&s;ually accommodated his con|&s;cience
to his intere&s;t, that Ellena was to|tally
ignorant as to who were her imme|diate
per&s;ecutors, and equally un&s;u&s;pi|cious
of any other evil having been in|tended
her, than that of a temporary con|&s;inement.</P>
<P>The la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion was admitted by the
Marche&s;a to be probable, till the bold|ne&s;s
of the fir&s;t made her doubt the truth
of each, and occa&s;ioned her new &s;ur|prize
and conjecture as to the motive;
which could induce Schedoni to venture
the&s;e untruths. She then inquired where
Ellena was now di&s;po&s;ed of, but he had
too much prudence to di&s;clo&s;e the place
of her; retreat, however plau&s;ible might
<PB N="107" REF="108">
be the air with which the inquiry was
urged; and he endeavoured to call off
her attention to Vivaldi. The Confe&s;&s;or
did not, however, venture, at pre&s;ent, to
give a hint as to the pretended di&s;covery
of his &s;ituation in the inqui&s;ition, but re|&s;erved
to a more favourable opportunity,
&s;uch mention, together with the zealous,
offer, of his &s;ervices to extricate the pri|&s;oner.
The Marche&s;a, believing that her
&s;on was &s;till engaged in pur&s;uit of El|lena,
made many inquiries concerning
him, but without expre&s;&s;ing any &s;olici|tude
for his welfare; re&s;entment appear|ing
to be the only emotion. &s;he retained
towards him. While Schedoni replied
with circum&s;pection to her que&s;tions, he
urged inquiries of his own, as to the
manner in which the Marche&s;a endured
the long ab&s;ence of Vivaldi; thus endea|vouring
to a&s;certain how far he might
hereafter venture to appear in any efforts
for liberating him, and how &s;hape his
<PB N="108" REF="109">
conduct re&s;pecting Ellena. It &s;eemcd
that the Marche&s;e was not indifferent as
to his &s;on's ab&s;ence; and, though he had
at first believed the &s;earch for Ellena to
have occa&s;ioned it, other apprehen&s;ions
now di&s;turbed him, and taught him the
feelings of a father. His numerous avo|cations
and intere&s;ts, however, &s;eemed to
prevent &s;uch anxiety from preying upon
his mind; and, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed per&s;ons
in &s;earch of Vivaldi, he pa&s;&s;ed his time
in the u&s;ual routine of company and the
court. Of the actual &s;ituation of his &s;on
it was evident that neither he, nor the
Marche&s;a, had the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion,
and this was a circum&s;tance, which the
Confe&s;&s;or was very careful to a&s;certain.</P>
<P>Before he took, leave, he ventured to
renew the mention of Vivaldi's attach|ment,
and gently to plead for him. The
Marchc&s;a, however, &s;eemed inattentive
to what he repre&s;ented, till, at length,
awaking form her reverie, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;&startq;Fa|ther,
<PB N="109" REF="110">
you have judged ill&mdash;,&endq; and, be|fore
&s;he concluded the &s;entence, &s;he re|lap&s;ed
again into thoughtful &s;ilence. Be|lieving
that he anticipated her meaning,
Schedoni began to repeat his own justi|fication
re&s;pecting his conduct towards
Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;You have judged erroneou&s;ly, fa|ther,&endq;
re&s;umed the Marche&s;a, with the
&s;ame con&s;idering air, &startq;in placing the
girl in &s;uch a &s;ituation; my &s;on cannot
fail to di&s;cover her there.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Or wherever &s;he may be,&endq; replied
the. Confe&s;&s;or, believing that he under|&s;tood
the Marche&s;a's aim. &startq;It may not
he po&s;&s;ible to conceal her long from his
&s;earch&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The neighbourhood of Naples ought
at lea&s;t to have been avoided,&endq; ob&s;erved;
the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;ilent, and &s;he added, &startq;So
near, al&s;o, to his own, re&s;idence! How
far is the <HI>Santa della Pieta</HI> from the Vi|valdi
palace?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111">
Though Schedoni had thought that the
Marche&s;a, while di&s;playing a pretended
knowledge of Ellena's retreat, was only
endeavouring to obtain a real one, this
mention of the place of her actual re&s;i|dence
&s;hocked him; but he replied al|mo&s;t
immediately, &startq;I am ignorant of
the di&s;tance, for, till now, I was unac|quainted
that there is a convent of the
name you mention. It appears, how|ever,
that this <HI>Santa della Pi&egrave;ta</HI> is the
place, of all other, which ought to have
been avoided. How could you &s;u&s;pect
me, lady, of imprudence thus extrava|gant!&endq;</P>
<P>While Schedoni &s;poke, the Marche&s;a.
regarded him attentively, and then re|plied,
&startq;I may be allowed, good father
to &s;u&s;pect your prudence in this in&s;tance,
&s;ince you have ju&s;t given me &s;o unequi|vocal
a proof of it in another.&endq;</P>
<P>She would then have changed the &s;ub|ject,
but Schedoni, believing this incli|nation
<PB N="111" REF="112">
to be the con&s;equence of her having
a&s;&s;ured her&s;elf, that &s;he had actually di&s;|covered
Ellena's a&s;ylum, and too rea&s;on|ably
&s;u&s;pecting the dreadful u&s;e &s;he de|&s;igned
to make of the di&s;covery, endea|voured
to unfettle her opinion, and mi&s;|lead
her as to the place of Ellena's abode.
He not only contradicted the fact of her
pre&s;ent re&s;idence at the <HI>Santa della Pi&egrave;ta,</HI>
but, without &s;cruple, made a po&s;itive a&s;|&s;ertion,
that, &s;he was at a di&s;tance from
Naples, naming, at the &s;ame time, a &s;ic|titious
place, who&s;e ob&s;curity, he added,
would be the be&s;t protection from the
pur&s;uit of Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Very, true, father,&endq; ob&s;erved the
Marche&s;a; &startq;I believe that my &s;on will
not readily di&s;cover the girl in the place
you have named.&endq;</P>
<P>Whether the Marche&s;a believed Sche|doni's
a&s;&s;ertion or not, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed no
farther curio&s;ity on the &s;ubject, and ap|peared
con&s;iderably more tranquil than
<PB N="112" REF="113">
before. She now chatted with ea&s;e on
general topics, while the Confe&s;&s;or dared
no more to urge the &s;ubject of his &s;ecret
wi&s;hes; and, having &s;upported, for &s;ome
time, a conver&s;ation mo&s;t uncongenial
with his temper, he took his leave, and
returned to Naples. On the way thither,
he reviewed, with exactne&s;s, the late be|haviour
of the Marche&s;a, and the re&s;ult
of this examination was a re&s;olution&mdash;
never to renew the &s;ubject of their con|ver&s;ation,
but to &s;olemnize, without her
con&s;ent, the nuptials of Vivaldi and El|lena.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, meanwhile, on the
departure of Schedoni, remained in the
attitude in which he had left her, and
ab&s;orbed by the intere&s;t, which his vi&s;it
excited. The &s;udden change in his con|duct
no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed and perplexed,
than di&s;appointed her. She could not
explain it by the &s;uppo&s;ition of any prin|ciple
or motive. Sometimes it occurred
<PB N="113" REF="114">
to her, that Vivaldi had bribed him with
rich promi&s;es to promote the marriage,
which he contributed to thwart; but,
when &s;he con&s;idered the high expecta|tions
&s;he had her&s;elf encouraged him to
cheri&s;h, the improbability of the conjec|ture
was apparent. That Schedoni, from
whatever cau&s;e, was no longer to be
tru&s;ted in this bu&s;ine&s;s, was &s;ufficiently
clear, but &s;he endeavoured to con&s;ole her|&s;elf
with a hope that a more con&s;idential
per&s;on might yet be di&s;covered. A part
of Schedoni's re&s;olution &s;he al&s;o adopted,
which was, never again to introduce the
&s;ubject of their late conver&s;ation. But,
while &s;he &s;hould &s;ilently pur&s;ue her own
plans &s;he determined to conduct her|&s;elf
towards Schedoni in every other re|&s;pect,
as u&s;ual, not &s;uffering him to &s;u&s;|pect
that &s;he had withdrawn her con&s;i|dence,
but inducing him to believe that
&s;he had relinqui&s;hed all farther de&s;ign
again&s;t Ellena.</P>

<BIBL>THOMSON.</BIBL>
<P>ELLENA, obedient to the command of
Schedoni, withdrew from her home on
the day that followed her arrival there,
to the <HI>Santa della Pi&eacute;ta.</HI> The Superiour,
who had known her from her infancy,
and, from the acquaintance which &s;uch
long ob&s;ervation afforded, had both
e&s;teemed and loved her, received Ellena
with a degree of &s;atisfaction proportionate
<PB N="115" REF="116">
to the concern &s;he had &s;uffered when in|formed
of her di&s;a&s;trous removal from
the Villa Altieri.</P>
<P>Among the quiet groves of this con|vent,
however, Ellena vainly endeavoured
to moderate her &s;olicitude re&s;pecting the
&s;ituation of Vivaldi; for, now that &s;he had
a re&s;pite from immediate calamity, &s;he
thought with more inten&s;e anxiety as to
what might be his &s;ufferings, and her fears
and impatience increa&s;ed, as each day di&s;|appointed
her expectation of intelligence
from Schedoni.</P>
<P>If the &s;oothings of &s;ympathy and the
delicate arts of benevolence could have
re&s;tored the &s;erenity of her mind, Ellena
would now have been peaceful; for all
the&s;e were offered her by the abbe&s;s and
the &s;i&s;ters of the <HI>Santa della Pi&eacute;ta.</HI> They
were not acquainted with the cau&s;e of her
&s;orrow, but they perceived that &s;he was
unhappy, and wi&s;hed her to be otherwi&s;e.
The &s;ociety of <HI>Our Lady of Pity,</HI> was
<PB N="116" REF="117">
&s;uch as a convent does not often &s;hroud;
to the wi&s;dom and virtue of the Superiour,
the &s;i&s;terhood was principally indebted for
the harmony and happine&s;s which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
them. This lady was a &s;hining
example to governe&s;&s;es of religious hou&s;es,
and a &s;triking in&s;tance of the influence,
which a virtuous mind may acquire over,
others, as well as of the exten&s;ive good
that it may thus diffu&s;e. She was dignified
without haughtine&s;s, religious without
bigotry, and mild, though deci&s;ive and
firm. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed penetration to di&s;|cover
what was ju&s;t, re&s;olution to adhere
to it, and temper to practi&s;e it with gen|tlene&s;s
and grace; &s;o that even correction
from her, a&s;&s;umed the winning air of
courte&s;y: the per&s;on, whom &s;he admo|ni&s;hed,
wept in &s;orrow for the offence,
in&s;tead of being &s;ecretly irritated by the
reproof, and loved her as a mother, rather
than feared her as a judge. Whatever
might be her failings, they were effectually
<PB N="117" REF="118">
concealed by the general benevolence of
her heart, and the harmony of her mind;
a harmony, not the effect of torpid feel|ings,
but the accompli&s;hment of correct
and vigilant judgment. Her religion was
neither gloomy, nor bigotted; it was
the &s;entiment of a grateful heart offering
it&s;elf up to a Deity, who delights in the
happine&s;s of his creatures; and &s;he con|formed
to the cu&s;toms of the Roman
church, without &s;uppo&s;ing a faith in all of
them to be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. This
opinion, however, &s;he was obliged to
conceal, left her very virtue &s;hould draw
upon her the puni&s;hment of a crime, from
&s;ome fierce eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who contradicted,
in their practice the very e&s;&s;ential princi|ples,
which the chri&s;tianity they pro&s;e&s;&s;ed
would have taught them.</P>
<P>In her lectures to the nuns &s;he &s;eldom
touched upon points of faith, but ex|plained
and enforced the moral duties,
particularly &s;uch as were mo&s;t practicable
in the &s;ociety to which &s;he belonged; &s;uch
<PB N="118" REF="119">
as tended to &s;often and harmonize the
affections, to impart that repo&s;e of mind,
which per&s;uades to the practice of &s;i&s;terly
kindne&s;s, univer&s;al charity, and the mo&s;t
pure and elevated devotion. When &s;he
&s;poke of religion, it appeared &s;o intere&s;t|ing,
&s;o beautiful, that her attentive audi|tors
revered and loved it as a friend, a re|finer
of the heart, a &s;ublime con&s;oler;
and experienced &s;omewhat of the meek.
and holy ardour, which may belong to
angelic natures.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety appeared like a large family,
of which the lady abbe&s;s was the mother,
rather than an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;trangers;
and particularly when gathered around
her, they li&s;tened to the evening &s;ermen,
which &s;he delivered with &s;uch affectionate
intere&s;t, &s;uch per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, and
&s;ometimes with &s;uch pathetic energy, as
few hearts could re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>She encouraged in her convent every
innocent and liberal pur&s;uit, which might
<PB N="119" REF="120">
&s;weeten the au&s;terities of confinement, and
which were generally rendered in&s;tru|mental
to charity. The <HI>Daughters of Pity</HI>
particularly excelled in mu&s;ic; not in tho&s;e
difficulties of the art, which di&s;play florid
graces, and intricate execution, but in
&s;uch eloquence of found as &s;teals upon
the heart, and awakens its &s;weete&s;t and
be&s;t affections. It was probably the well-regulated
&s;en&s;ibility of their own minds,
that enabled the&s;e &s;i&s;ters to diffu&s;e through
their &s;trains a character of &s;uch finely|tempered
ta&s;te, as drew crowds of vi&s;itors,
on every fe&s;tival, to the church of the
<HI>Santa della Pi&eacute;ta.</HI></P>
<P>The local circum&s;tances of this convent
were &s;carcely le&s;s agreeable than the har|mony
of its &s;ociety was intere&s;ting. The&s;e
exten&s;ive domains included olive-grounds,
vineyards, and &s;ome corn-land; a con&s;i|derable
tract was devoted to the plea&s;ures
of the garden, who&s;e groves &s;upplied
walnuts, almonds, oranges, and citrons,
<PB N="120" REF="121">
in abundance, and almo&s;t every kind of
fruit and flower, which this luxurious
climate nurtured. The&s;e gardens hung
upon the &s;lope of a hill, about a mile
within the &s;hore, and afforded exten&s;ive
views of the country round Naples, and
of the gulf. But from the terraces, which
extended along a &s;emicircular range of
rocks, that ro&s;e over the convent, and
formed a part of the domain, the pro|&s;pects
were infinitely finer. They extended
on the &s;outh to the i&s;le of Capraea, where
the gulf expands into the &s;ea; in the
we&s;t, appeared the i&s;land of I&s;chia, di&s;|tingui&s;hed
by the white pinnacles of the
lo&s;ty mountain Epomeo; and near it Pro|&s;ida,
with its many-coloured cliffs, ro&s;e
out of the waves. Overlooking many
points towards Puzzuoli, the eye caught
beyond other promontories, and others
further &s;till, to the north, a glimp&s;e of
the &s;ea, that bathes the now de&s;olate &s;hores
of Baia; with Capua, and all the towne
<PB N="121" REF="122">
and villas, that &s;peckle the garden-plains
between Ca&s;erta and Naples.</P>
<P>In the nearer &s;cene were the rocky
heights of Pau&s;ilippo, and Naples it&s;elf,
with all its crowded &s;uburbs a&s;cending
among the hills, and mingling with vine|yards
and overtopping cypre&s;s; the ca&s;tle
of San Elmo, con&s;picuous on its rock,
overhanging the magnificent mona&s;tery of
the Chartreux; while in the &s;cene below
appeared the <HI>Ca&s;tel Nuovo,</HI> with its clu&s;|tered
towers, the long-extended Cor&s;o,
the mole, with its tall pharos, and the
harbour gay with painted &s;hipping, and
full to the brim with the blue waters
of the bay. Beyond the hills of Naples,
the whole horizon to the north and ea&s;t
was bounded by the mountains of the
Appenine, an amphitheatre proportioned
to the grandeur of the plain, which the
gulf &s;pread out below.</P>
<P>The&s;e terraces, &s;haded with acacias
and plane-trees, were the favourite haunt
of Ellena. Between the opening branches,
<PB N="122" REF="123">
&s;he looked down upon Villa Altieri, which
brought to her remembrance the affect|tionate
Bianchi, with all the &s;portive years
of her childhood; and where &s;ome of her
happie&s;t hours had been pa&s;&s;ed in the
&s;ociety of Vivaldi. Along the windings
of the coa&s;t, too, &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h
many places rendered &s;acred by affection,
to which &s;he had made excur&s;ions with
her lamented relative, and Vivaldi; and,
though &s;adne&s;s mingled with the recollec|tions
a view of them re&s;tored, they were
precious to her heart. Here, alone and
unob&s;erved, &s;he frequently yielded to the
melancholy which &s;he endeavoured to &s;up|pre&s;s
in &s;ociety; and at other times tried
to deceive, with books and the pencil,
the lingering moments of uncertainty con|cerning
the &s;tate of Vivaldi; for day after
day &s;till elap&s;ed without bringing any in|telligence,
from Schedoni. Whenever the
late &s;cenes connected with the di&s;covery
of her family recurred to Ellena, &s;he was
<PB N="123" REF="124">
&s;truck with almo&s;t as much amazement as
if &s;he was gazing upon a vi&s;ion, in&s;tead
of recalling realities. Contra&s;ted with
the &s;ober truth of her pre&s;ent life, the pa&s;t
appeared like romance; and there were
moments when &s;he &s;hrunk from the rela|tion&s;hip
of Schedoni with unconquerable
a&s;&s;right. The fir&s;t emotions his appear|ance
had excited were &s;o oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e
of filial tenderne&s;s, that &s;he perceived it
was now nearly impo&s;&s;ible to love and revere
him as her father, and &s;he endeavoured,
by dwelling upon all the obligations,
which &s;he believed he had lately conferred
upon her, to repay him in gratitude, what
was withheld in affection.</P>
<P>In &s;uch melancholy con&s;iderations, &s;he
often lingered under the &s;hade of the
accacias, till the &s;un had &s;unk behind the
far di&s;tant promontory of Mi&s;eno, and the
la&s;t bell of ve&s;pers &s;ummoned her to the
convent below.</P>
<P>Among the nuns, Ellena had many
favourites, but not one that &s;he admired
<PB N="124" REF="125">
and loved equally with Olivia of San
Ste&s;ano, the remembrance of whom was
always accompanied with a fear left &s;he
&s;hould have &s;uffered from her generous
compa&s;&s;ion, and a wi&s;h that &s;he had taken
up her abode with the happy &s;ociety of
the <HI>Daughters of Pity,</HI> in&s;tead of being
&s;ubjected to the tyranny of the abbe&s;s of
San Stefano. To Ellena, the magnificent
&s;cenes of the <HI>Santa della Pi&egrave;ta</HI> &s;eemed to
open a &s;ecure, and, perhaps, a la&s;t a&s;ylum;
for, in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, &s;he could
not avoid perceiving how menacing and va|rious
were the objections to her marriage
with Vivaldi, even &s;hould Schedoni prove
propitious to it. The character of the Mar|che&s;a
di Vivaldi, &s;uch as it &s;tood unfolded
by the late occurrences, &s;truck her with
di&s;may, for her de&s;igns appeared &s;uffi|ciently
atrocious, whether they had ex|tended
to the utmo&s;t limit of Ellena's
&s;u&s;picions, or had &s;topped where the af|fected
charity of Schedoni had pointed
<PB N="125" REF="126">
out. In either ca&s;e, the pertinacity of her
aver&s;ion, and the vindictive violence of
her nature, were obvious.</P>
<P>In this view of her character, however, it
was not the inconvenience threatened to
tho&s;e who might become connected with
her, that principally affected Ellena, but the
circum&s;tance of &s;uch a woman being the
mother of Vivaldi; and, to alleviate &s;o
afflicting a con&s;ideration, &s;he endeavoured
to believe all the palliating &s;ugge&s;tions of
Schedoni, re&s;pecting the Marche&s;a's late
intentions. But if Ellena w&aacute;s grieved on
di&s;covering crime in the character of Vival|di's
parent, what would have been her
&s;uffering, had &s;he &s;u&s;pected the nature of
Schedoni?&mdash;what, if &s;he had been told
that he was the advi&s;er of the Marche&s;a's
plans?&mdash;if &s;he had known that he had
been the partner of her intentional guilt?
From &s;uch &s;uffering &s;he was yet &s;pared,
as well as from that, which a knowledge
of Vivaldi's pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and of the
<PB N="126" REF="127">
re&s;ult of Schedoni's efforts to procure a
relea&s;e from the perils, among which he
had precipitated him, would have in|flicted.
Had &s;he known this, it is pro|bable
that in the fir&s;t de&s;pondency of her
mind, &s;he would have relinqui&s;hed what
is called the world, and &s;ought a la&s;ting
a&s;ylum with the &s;ociety of the holy &s;i&s;ters.
Even as it was, &s;he &s;ometimes endeavoured
to look with re&s;ignation upon the events
which might render &s;uch a &s;tep de&s;irable;
but it was an effort that &s;eldom &s;oothed
her even with a temporary &s;elf-delu&s;ion.
Should the veil, however, prove her final
refuge, it would be by her own choice;
for the lady abbe&s;s of the <HI>Santa della
Pi&eacute;ta</HI> employed no art to win a reclu&s;e,
nor &s;uffered the nuns to &s;educe votaries to
the order.</P>

<P>WHILE the late events had been pa&s;&s;ing
in the Garganus, and at Naples, Vivaldi
and his &s;ervant Paulo remained impri|&s;oned
in di&s;tinct chambers of the Inqui|&s;ition.
They were again &s;eparately in|terrogated.
From the &s;ervant no informa|tion
could be obtained; he a&s;&s;erted only his
ma&s;ter's innocence, without once remem|bering
to mention his own; clamoured,
with more ju&s;tne&s;s than prudence, again&s;t
the per&s;ons who had occa&s;ioned his arre&s;t;
&s;eriou&s;ly endeavouring to convince the
inqui&s;itors, that he him&s;elf had <HI>no other
motive</HI> in having demanded to be brought
<PB N="128" REF="129">
to the&s;e pri&s;ons than that he might comfort
his ma&s;ter, he gravely remon&s;trated on
the inju&s;tice of &s;eparating them, adding,
that he was &s;ure when they knew the
rights of the matter, they would order
him to be carried to the pri&s;on of Signor
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;I do a&s;&s;ure your <HI>Sereni&s;&s;imo</HI> Illu&s;tri&s;|&s;$$$,&endq;
continued Paulo, addre&s;&s;ing the
chief inqui&s;itor with profound gravity,
&startq;that this is the la&s;t place I &s;hould have
thought of coming to, on any other ac|count;
and if you will only conde&s;cend
to a&s;k your officials, who took my ma&s;ter
up, they will tell you <HI>as good.</HI> They
knew well enough all along, what I
came here for, and if they had known it
would be all in vain, it would have been
but civil of them to have told me as
much, and not have brought me; for this
is the la&s;t place in the world I would
have come to, otherwi&s;e, of my own
accord.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="130">
Paulo was permitted to harangue in
his own way, becau&s;e his examiners hoped
that his prolixity would be a means of
betraying circum&s;tances connected with his
ma&s;ter. By this view, however, they were
mi&s;led, for Paulo, with all his &s;implicity
of heart, was both vigilant and &s;hrewd in
Vivaldi's intere&s;t. But, when he per|ceived
them really convinced, that his &s;ole
motive for vi&s;iting the Inqui&s;ition was
that he might con&s;ole his ma&s;ter, yet
&s;till per&s;i&s;ting in the re&s;olution of &s;e|parately
confining him, his indignation
knew no bounds. He de&s;pi&s;ed alike their
reprehen&s;ion, their thundering menaces,
and their more artful exhibitions; told
them of all they had to expect both here
and hereafter, for their cruelty to his dear
ma&s;ter, and &s;aid they might do what they
would with him; he de&s;ied, them to make
him more mi&s;erable than he was.</P>
<P>It was not without difficulty that he
was removed from the chamber; where
<PB N="130" REF="131">
he left his examiners in a &s;tate of a&s;toni&s;h|ment
at his ra&s;hne&s;s, and indignation of
his hone&s;ty, &s;uch as they had, probably,
never experienced before.</P>
<P>When Vivaldi was again called up to
the table of the Holy Office, he under|went
a longer examination than on a for|mer
occa&s;ion. Several inqui&s;itors attended,
and every art was employed to induce him
to confe&s;s crimes, of which he was &s;u&s;|pected,
and to draw from him a di&s;covery
of others, which might have eluded even
&s;u&s;picion. Still the examiners cautiou&s;ly
avoided informing him of the &s;ubject of the
accu&s;ation on which he had been arre&s;ted,
and it was, therefore, only on the former
a&s;&s;urances of the Benedictine, and the offi|cials
in the chapel of San Seba&s;tian, that
Vivaldi under&s;tood he was accu&s;ed of hav|ing
carried off a nun. His an&s;wers on the
pre&s;ent occa&s;ion were conci&s;e and firm,
and his whole deportment undaunted. He
felt le&s;s apprehension for him&s;elf, than
<PB N="131" REF="132">
indignation of the general inju&s;tice and
cruelty, which the tribunal was permitted
to exerci&s;e upon others; and this virtuous
indignation gave a loftine&s;s, a calm heroic
grandeur to his mind, which never, for a
moment, for&s;ook him, except when he
conjectured what might be the &s;ufferings
of Ellena. Then, his fortitude and mag|nanimity
failed, and his tortured &s;pirit ro&s;e
almo&s;t to frenzy.</P>
<P>On this, his &s;econd examination, he
was urged by the &s;ame dark que&s;tions,
and replied to them with the &s;ame open
&s;incerity, as during the fir&s;t. Yet the
&s;implicity and energy of truth failed to
impre&s;s conviction on minds, which, no
longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the virtue them&s;elves,
were not competent to under&s;tand the
&s;ymptoms of it in others. Vivaldi was
again threatened with the torture, and
again di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to his pri&s;on.</P>
<P>On the way to this dreadful abode, a
per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed him in one of the avenues,
<PB N="132" REF="133">
of who&s;e air and figure he thought he had
&s;ome recollection; and, as the &s;tranger
&s;talked away, he &s;uddenly knew him to
be the prophetic monk, who had haunted
him among the ruins of Paluzzi. In the
fir&s;t moment of &s;urprize, Vivaldi lo&s;t his
pre&s;ence of mind &s;o far, that he made no
attempt to interrupt him. In the next in|&s;tant,
however, he pau&s;ed and looked
back, with an intention of &s;peaking; but
this my&s;terious per&s;on was already at the
extremity of the avenue. Vivaldi called,
and be&s;ought him to &s;top. Without either
&s;peaking, or turning his head, however,
he immediately di&s;appeared beyond a door
that opened at his approach. Vivaldi, on
attempting to take the way of the monk,
was withheld by his guards, and, when
he inquired who was the &s;tranger he had
&s;een, the officials a&s;ked, in their turn,
what &s;tranger he alluded to.</P>
<P>&startq;He who has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed us,&endq; replied
Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134">
The officials &s;eemed &s;urprized, &startq;Your
&s;pirits are di&s;ordered, Signor,&endq; ob&s;erved
one of them, &startq;I &s;aw no per&s;on pa&s;s!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He pa&s;&s;ed &s;o clo&s;ely,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi,
&startq;that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible you could
avoid feeing him!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I did not even hear a foot&s;tep!&endq; added
the man.</P>
<P>&startq;I do not recollect that I did,&endq; an|&s;wered
Vivaldi, &startq;but I &s;aw his figure as
plainly as I now &s;ee your's; his black,
garments almo&s;t touched me! Was he an
inqui&s;itor?&endq;</P>
<P>The official appeared a&s;toni&s;hed; and,
whether his &s;urprize was real, or affected
for the purpo&s;e of concealing his know|ledge
of the per&s;on alluded to, his em|barra&s;&s;ment
and awe &s;eemed natural. Vi|valdi
ob&s;erved, with almo&s;t equal curio&s;ity
and &s;urprize, the fear which his face ex|pre&s;&s;ed; but perceived al&s;o, that it would
avail nothing to repeat his que&s;tions.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="135">
As they proceeded along the avenue, a
kind of half-&s;tifled groan was &s;ometimes
audible from a di&s;tance. &startq;Whence come
tho&s;e &s;ounds?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;they &s;trike
to my heart!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They &s;hould do &s;o,&endq; replied the
guard.</P>
<P>&startq;Whence come they?&endq; repeated Vi|valdi,
more impatiently, and &s;huddering.</P>
<P>&startq;From the place of torture,&endq; &s;aid the official.</P>
<P>&startq;O God! O God!&endq; exclaimed Vivaldi,
with a deep groan.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed with ha&s;ty &s;teps the door of
that terrible chamber, and the guard did
not attempt to &s;top him. The officials
had brought him, in obedience to the
cu&s;tomary orders they had received, within
hearing of tho&s;e doleful founds, for the
purpo&s;e of impre&s;&s;ing upon his mind the
horrors of the puni&s;hment, with which he
was threatened, and of inducing him to
confe&s;s without incurring them.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136">
On this &s;ame evening, Vivaldi was
vi&s;ited, in his pri&s;on, by a man whom he
had never con&s;ciou&s;ly &s;een before. He
appeared to be between forty and fifty;
was of a grave and ob&s;ervant phy&s;iognomy,
and of manners, which, though &s;omewhat
au&s;tere, were not alarming. The account
he gave of him&s;elf and of his motive for
this vi&s;it, was curious. He &s;aid that
he al&s;o was a pri&s;oner in the inqui&s;ition,
but, as the ground of accu&s;ation again&s;t
him was light, he had been favoured
&s;o far as to be allowed &s;ome degree of
liberty within certain bounds; that, hav|ing
heard of Vivaldi's &s;ituation, he had
a&s;ked and obtained leave to conver&s;e with
him, which he had done in compa&s;&s;ion;
and with a de&s;ire of a&s;&s;uaging his &s;uffer|ings,
&s;o far as an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ympathy
and commi&s;eration might relieve them.</P>
<P>While he &s;poke, Vivaldi regarded him
with deep attention, and the improbability
that the&s;e preten&s;ions &s;hould be true, did
<PB N="136" REF="137">
not e&s;cape him; but the &s;u&s;picion which
they occa&s;ioned he prudently concealed.
The &s;tranger conver&s;ed on various &s;ub|jects.
Vivaldi's an&s;wers were cautious and
conci&s;e; but not even long pau&s;es of
&s;ilence wearied the compa&s;&s;ionate patience
of his vi&s;itor. Among other topics he,
at length, introduced that of religion.</P>
<P>&startq;I have, my&s;elf, been accu&s;ed of he|re&s;y,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;and know how to pity
others in the &s;ame &s;ituation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is of here&s;y, then, that I am ac|cu&s;ed!&endq;
interrupted Vivaldi, &startq;of here&s;y!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It availed me nothing that I a&s;&s;erted
my innocence,&endq; continued the &s;tranger,
without noticing Vivaldi's exclamation,
&startq;I was condemned to the torture. My
&s;ufferings were too terrible to be endured!
I confe&s;&s;ed my offence&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon me,&endq; interrupted Vivaldi,
&startq;but allow me to ob&s;erve, that &s;ince
your &s;ufferings were &s;o &s;evere, your's,
again&s;t whom the ground, of accu&s;ation
<PB N="137" REF="138">
was light, what may be the puni&s;hment
of tho&s;e, who&s;e offences are more &s;e|rious?&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;tranger was &s;omewhat embar|ra&s;&s;ed.
&startq;My offence was &s;light,&endq; he
continued, without giving a full an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, again in|terrupting
him, &startq;that here&s;y can be con|&s;idered
as a &s;light offence before the tri|bunal
of the Inqui&s;ition?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was only of a &s;light degree of
here&s;y,&endq; replied the vi&s;itor, reddening
with di&s;plea&s;ure, &startq;that I was &s;u&s;pected,
and&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Does then the Inqui&s;ition allow of de|grees
in here&s;y?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;I confe&s;&s;ed my offence,&endq; added the
&s;tranger with a louder empha&s;is, and the
con&s;equence of this confe&s;&s;ion was a re|mi&s;&s;ion
of puni&s;hment. After a trifling
penance I &s;hall be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and proba|bly,
in a few days, leave the pri&s;on. Be|fore
<PB N="138" REF="139">
I left it, I was de&s;irous of admini&s;ter|ing
&s;ome degree of con&s;olation to a fellow
&s;ufferer; if you have any friends whom
you with to inform of your &s;ituation, do
not fear to confide their names and your
me&s;&s;age to me.&endq;</P>
<P>The latter part of the &s;peech was deli|vered
in a low voice, as if the &s;tranger
feared to be overheard. Vivaldi remained
&s;ilent, while he examined, with clo&s;er at|tention,
the countenance of his vi&s;itor.
It was of the utmo&s;t importance to him,
that his family &s;hould be made acquainted
with his &s;ituation; yet he knew not ex|actly
how to interpret, or to confide in
this offer. Vivaldi had heard that in|formers
&s;ometimes vi&s;ited the pri&s;oners,
and, under the affectation of kindne&s;s and
&s;ympathy, drew from them a confe&s;&s;ion of
opinions, which were afterwards urged
again&s;t them; and obtained di&s;coveries
relative to their connections and friends,
who were, by the&s;e in&s;idious means, fre|quently
<PB N="139" REF="140">
involved in their de&s;truction. Vi|valdi,
con&s;cious of his own innocence,
had, on his fir&s;t examination, acquainted
the inqui&s;itor with the names and re&s;idence
of his family; he had, therefore, nothing
new to apprehend from revealing them to
this &s;tranger; but he perceived that if it
&s;hould be known he had attempted to con|vey
a me&s;&s;age, however conci&s;e and harm|le&s;s,
the di&s;covery would irritate the jea|lous
inqui&s;itors again&s;t him, and might be
urged as a new pre&s;umption of his guilt.
The&s;e con&s;iderations, together with the
di&s;tru&s;t which the incon&s;i&s;tency of his
vi&s;itor's a&s;&s;ertions, and the occa&s;ional em|barra&s;&s;ment
of his manner, had awakened,
determined Vivaldi to re&s;i&s;t the temptation
now offered to him; and the &s;tranger,
having received his thanks, reluctantly
withdrew, ob&s;erving, however, that &s;hould
any unfore&s;een circum&s;tance detain him in
the Inqui&s;ition longer than he had rea&s;on
to expect, he &s;hould beg leave to pay him
<PB N="140" REF="141">
another vi&s;it. In reply to this, Vivaldi
only bowed, but he remarked that the
&s;tranger's countenance changed, and that
&s;ome dark brooding appeared to cloud his.
mind, as he quitted the chamber.</P>
<P>Several days elap&s;ed, during which Vi|valdi
heard no more of his new acquaint|ance.
He was then &s;ummoned to another
examination, from which he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
as before; and &s;ome weeks of &s;olitude and
of heavy uncertainty &s;ucceeded, after
which he was a fourth time called up to
the table of the Holy Office. It was then
&s;urrounded by inqui&s;itors, and a more
than u&s;ual &s;olemnity appeared in the pro|ceeding's.</P>
<P>As proofs of Vivaldi's innocence had
not been obtained, the &s;u&s;picions of his
examiners, of cour&s;e, were not removed;
and, as he per&s;i&s;ted in denying the truth
of the charge which he under&s;tood would
be exhibited again&s;t him, and refu&s;ed to
make any confe&s;&s;ion of crimes, it was or|dered
<PB N="141" REF="142">
that he &s;hould, within three hours,
be put to the <HI>que&s;tion.</HI> Till then, Vivaldi
was once more di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to his pri&s;on
chamber. His re&s;olution remained un|&s;haken,
but he could not look, unmoved,
upon the horrors which might be preparing
for him. The interval of expeclation be|tween
the &s;entence and the accompli&s;h|ment
of this preliminary puni&s;hment, was,
indeed, dreadful. The &s;eeming ignominy
of his &s;ituation, and his ignorance as to the
degree of torture to be applied, overcame
the calmne&s;s he had before exhibited, and
as he paced his cell, cold damps, which
hung upon his forehead, betrayed the
agony of his mind. It was not long, how|ever,
that he &s;uffered from a &s;en&s;e of
ignominy; his better judgment &s;hewed
him, that innocence cannot &s;uffer di&s;grace
from any &s;ituation or circum&s;tance, and he
once more re&s;umed the courage and the
&s;irmne&s;s which belong to virtue.</P>
<P>It was about midnight, that Vivaldi
heard &s;teps approaching, and a murmur
<PB N="142" REF="143">
of voices at the door of his cell. He un|der&s;tood
the&s;e to be the per&s;ons come to
&s;ummon him to the torture. The door
was unbarred, and two men, habited in
black, appeared at it. Without &s;peaking,
they advanced, and throwing over him a
&s;ingular kind of mantle, led him from the
chamber.</P>
<P>Along the galleries, and other avenues
through which they pa&s;&s;ed, not any per&s;on
was &s;een, and, by the pro&s;ound &s;tillne&s;s
that reigned, it &s;eemed as if death had al|ready
anticipated his work in the&s;e regions
of horror, and had condemned, alike the
tortured and the torturer.</P>
<P>They de&s;cended to the large hall, where
Vivaldi had waited on the night of his
entrance, and thence through an avenue,
and down a long &s;light of &s;teps, that led
to &s;ubterranean chambers. His conductors
did not utter a &s;yllable during the whole
progre&s;s; Vivaldi knew too well that que&s;|tions
would only &s;ubject him to greater &s;e|verity,
and he a&s;ked none.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144">
The doors, through which they pa&s;&s;ed,
regularly opened at the touch of an iron
rod, carried by one of the officials, and
without the appearance of any per&s;on.
The other man bore a torch, and the pa&s;|&s;ages
were &s;o dimly lighted, that the way
could &s;carcely have been found without
one. They cro&s;&s;ed what &s;eemed to be a
burial vault, but the extent and ob&s;curity
of the place did not allow it to be a&s;cer|tained;
and, having reached an iron door,
they &s;topped. One of the officials &s;truck
upon it three times with the rod, but it
did not open as the others had done.
While they waited, Vivaldi thought he
heard, from within, low intermitting
&s;ounds, as of per&s;ons in their la&s;t extre|mity,
but, though within, they appeared
to come from a di&s;tance. His whole
heart was chilled, not with fear, for at
that moment he did not remember him|&s;elf,
but with horror.</P>
<P>Having waited a con&s;iderable time,
during which the official did not repeat
<PB N="144" REF="145">
the &s;ignal, the door was partly opened by
a per&s;on whom Vivaldi could not di&s;tin|gui&s;h
in the gloom beyond, and with
whom one of his conductors communi|cated
by &s;igns; after which the door was
clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Several minutes had elap&s;ed, when tones
of deep voices arou&s;ed the attention of
Vivaldi. They were loud and hoar&s;e, and
&s;poke in a language unknown to him.
At the &s;ounds, the official immediately
extingui&s;hed his torch. The voices drew
nearer, and, the door again unfolding,
two figures &s;tood before Vivaldi, which,
&s;hewn by a glimmering light within, &s;truck
him with a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;may. They
were cloathed, like his conductors, in
black, but in a different fa&s;hion, for their
habits were made clo&s;e to the &s;hape.
Their faces were entirely concealed be|neath
a very peculiar kind of cowl, which
de&s;cended from the head to the feet; and
their eyes only were vi&s;ible through &s;mall
<PB N="145" REF="146">
openings contrived for the &s;ight. It oc|curred
to Vivaldi that the&s;e men were tor|turers;
their appearance was worthy of
demons. Probably they were thus ha|bited,
that the per&s;ons whom they afflict|ed
might not know them; or, perhaps, it
was only for the purpo&s;e of &s;triking terror
upon the minds of the accu&s;ed, and thus
compelling them to confe&s;s without further
difficulty. Whatever motive might have
occa&s;ioned their horrific appearance, and
whatever was their office, Vivaldi was
delivered into their hands, and in the
&s;ame moment heard the iron door &s;hut,
which enclo&s;ed him with them in a nar|row
pa&s;&s;age, gloomily lighted by a lamp
&s;u&s;pended from the arched roof. They
walked in &s;ilence on each &s;ide of their
pri&s;oner, and came to a &s;econd door, which
admitted them in&s;tantly into another pa&s;|&s;age.
A third door, at a &s;hort di&s;tance,
admitted them to a third avenue, at the
$endof which one of his my&s;terious guides
<PB N="146" REF="147">
&s;truck upon a gate, and they &s;topped.
The uncertain, &s;ounds that Vivaldi had
&s;ancied he heard, were now more audi|ble,
and he di&s;tingui&s;hed, with inex|pre&s;&s;ible
horror, that they were uttered
by per&s;ons &s;uffering.</P>
<P>The gate was, at length, opened by a
figure habited like his conductors, and
two other doors of iron, placed very near
each other, being al&s;o unlocked, Vivaldi
found him&s;elf in a &s;pacious chamber, the
walls of which were hung with black,
du&s;kily lighted by lamps that gleamed in
the lofty vault. Immediately on his en|trance,
a &s;trange found ran along the
walls, and echoed among other vaults,
that appeared, by the progre&s;s of the
&s;ound, to extend far beyond this.</P>
<P>It was not immediately that Vivaldi
could &s;ufficiently recollect him&s;elf to ob|&s;erve
any object before him; and, even
when he did &s;o, the gloom of the place
prevented his a&s;certaining many appear|ances.
<PB N="147" REF="148">
Shadowy countenances and un|certain
forms &s;eemed to flit through the
du&s;k, and many in&s;tuments, the appli|cation
of which he did not comprehend,
&s;truck him with horrible &s;u&s;picions. Still
he heard, at intervals, half-&s;uppre&s;&s;ed
groans, and was looking round to di&s;co|ver
the wretched people from whom they
were extorted, when a voice, from a re|mote
part of the chamber, called on him
to advance.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance, and the ob&s;curity of the
&s;pot whence the voice i&s;&s;ued, had prevent|ed
Vivaldi from noticing any per&s;on there,
and he was now &s;lowly obeying, when,
on a &s;econd &s;ummons, his conductors
&s;eized his arms, and hurried him for|ward.</P>
<P>In a remote part of this exten&s;ive
chamber, he perceived three per&s;ons &s;eated
under a black canopy, on chairs rai&s;ed
&s;everal &s;teps from the floor, and who ap|peared
to pre&s;ide there in the office of ei|ther
<PB N="148" REF="149">
judges or examiners, or directors of
the puni&s;hments. Below, at a table, &s;at
a &s;ecretary, over whom was &s;u&s;pended the
only lamp that could enable him to com|mit
to paper what &s;hould occur during the
examination. Vivaldi now under&s;tood that
the three per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the tribu|nal
were the vicar general, or grand in|qui&s;itor,
the advocate of the exchequer,
and an ordinary inqui&s;itor, who was &s;eat|ed
between the other two, and who ap|peared
more eagerly to engage in the du|ties
of his cruel office. A portentous
ob&s;curity enveloped alike their per&s;ons
and their proceedings.</P>
<P>At &s;ome di&s;tance from the tribunal
&s;tood a large iron frame, which Vivaldi
conjectured to be the rack, and near it
another, re&s;embling, in &s;hape, a coffin,
but, happily, he could not di&s;tingui&s;h
through the remote ob&s;curity, any per&s;on
undergoing actual &s;uffering. In the
vaults beyond, however, the diabolical
<PB N="149" REF="150">
decrees of the inqui&s;itors &s;eemed to be
fulfilling; for, whenever a di&s;tant door
opened for a moment, &s;ounds of lamen|tation
i&s;&s;ued forth, and men, whom he
judged to be familiars, habited like, tho&s;e
who &s;tood be&s;ide him, were &s;een pa&s;&s;ing
to and fro within.</P>
<P>Vivaldi almo&s;t believed him&s;elf in the
infernal regions; the di&s;mal a&s;pect of
this place, the horrible preparation for
puni&s;hment, and, above all, the di&s;po&s;i|tion
and appearance of the per&s;ons that
were ready to inflict it, confirmed the re|&s;emblance.
That any human being &s;hould
willingly afflict a fellow being who had
never injured, or even offended him;
that, un&s;wayed by pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould de|liberately
become the means of torturing
him, appeared to Vivaldi nearly incredi|ble!
But when he looked at the three
per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the tribunal, and
con&s;idered that they had not only volun|tarily
undertaken the cruel office they
<PB N="150" REF="151">
fulfilled, but had probably long regarded
it as the &s;ummit of their ambition, his
a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation were un|bounded.</P>
<P>The grand inqui&s;itor, having again
called on Vivaldi by name, admoni&s;hed
him to con&s;efs the truth, and avoid the
&s;uffering that awaited him.</P>
<P>As Vivaldi had on former examinations
&s;poken the truth, which was not believed,
he had no chance of e&s;caping pre&s;ent
&s;uffering, but by a&s;&s;erting fal&s;hood: in
doing &s;o, to avoid &s;uch mon&s;trous inju&s;|tice
and cruelty, he might, perhaps, have
been ju&s;tified had it been certain that
&s;uch a&s;&s;ertion could affect him&s;elf alone;
but &s;ince he knew that the con&s;equence
mu&s;t extend to others, and, above all,
believed that Ellena di Ro&s;alba mu&s;t be
involved in it, he did not he&s;itate for an
In&s;tant to dare whatever torture his firm|ne&s;s
might provoke. But even if mora|lity
could have forgiven fal&s;hood in &s;uch
<PB N="151" REF="152">
extraordinary circum&s;tances as the&s;e, poli|cy,
after all, would have forbidden it,
&s;ince a di&s;covery of the artifice would
probably have led to the final de&s;truction
of the accu&s;ed per&s;on.</P>
<P>Of Ellena's &s;ituation he would now
have a&s;ked, however de&s;perate the que&s;|tion;
would again have a&s;&s;erted her inno|cence,
and &s;upplicated for compa&s;&s;ion,
even to inqui&s;itors, had he not perceived
that, in doing &s;o, he &s;hould only furni&s;h
them with a more exqui&s;ite means of
torturing him than any other they could
apply; for if, when all the terrors of his
&s;oul concerning her were under&s;tood, they
&s;hould threaten to increa&s;e her &s;ufferings,
as the puni&s;hment of what was termed
his ob&s;tinacy, they would, indeed, be|come
the ma&s;ters of his integrity, as well
as of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>The tribunal again, and repeatedly,
urged Vivaldi to con&s;e&s;s him&s;elf guilty;
and the inqui&s;itor, at length, concluded
<PB N="152" REF="153">
with &s;aying, that the judges were inno|cent
of whatever con&s;equence might en|&s;ue
from his ob&s;tinacy; &s;o that, if he
expired beneath his &s;ufferings, him&s;elf
only, not they, would have occa&s;ioned
his death.</P>
<P>&startq;I am innocent of the charges which
I under&s;tand are urged again&s;t me,&endq; &s;aid
Vivaldi, with &s;olemnity; &startq;I repeat, that
I am innocent! If, to e&s;cape the horrors
of the&s;e moments, I could be weak
enough to declare my&s;elf guilty, not all
your racks could alter truth, and make
me &s;o, except in that a&s;&s;ertion. The
con&s;equence of your tortures, therefore,
be upon your own heads!&endq;</P>
<P>While Vivaldi &s;poke, the vicar general
li&s;tened with attention, and, when he
had cea&s;ed to &s;peak, appeared to medi|tate;
but the inqui&s;itor was irritated by
the boldne&s;s of his &s;peech, in&s;tead of be|ing
convinced by the ju&s;tne&s;s of his re|pre&s;entation;
and made a &s;ignal for the
<PB N="153" REF="154">
officers to prepare for the <HI>que&s;tion.</HI> While
they were obeying, Vivaldi ob&s;erved, not|with&s;tanding
the agitation he &s;uffered, a
per&s;on cro&s;s the chamber, whom he im|mediately
knew to be the &s;ame that had
pa&s;&s;ed him in an avenue of the inqui&s;i|tion
on a former night, and whom he had
then fancied to be the my&s;terious &s;tranger
of Paluzzi. Vivaldi now fixed his eyes
upon him, but his own peculiar &s;itualion
prevented his feeling the intere&s;t he had
formerly &s;uffered concerning him.</P>
<P>The figure, air, and &s;talk, of this per|&s;on
were &s;o &s;triking, and &s;o &s;trongly re|&s;embled
tho&s;e of the monk of Paluzzi,
that Vivaldi had no longer a doubt as to
their identity. He pointed him out to one
of the officials, and inquired who he was.
While he &s;poke, the &s;tranger was pa&s;&s;ing
forward, and, before any reply was given,
a door leading to the farther vaults &s;hut
him from view. Vivaldi, however, re|peated
the inquiry, which the official ap|peared
<PB N="154" REF="155">
unable to an&s;wer, and a reproof
from the tribunal reminded him, that he
mu&s;t not a&s;k que&s;tions there. Vivaldi
ob&s;erved that it was the grand inqui&s;itor
who &s;poke, and that the manner of the
official immediately changed.</P>
<P>The familiars, who were the &s;ame that
had, conducted Vivaldi into the chamber,
having made ready the in&s;trument of tor|ture,
approached him, and, after taking
off his cloak and ve&s;t, bound him with
&s;trong cords. They threw over his head
the cu&s;tomary black garment, which en|tirely
enveloped his figure, and prevented
his ob&s;erving what was farther preparing.
In this-&s;tate of expectation, he was again
interrogated by the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>&startq;Was you ever in the church of the
&s;pirito Santo, at Naples?&endq; &s;aid he.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&endq; replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Did you ever expre&s;s there a: con|tempt
for the Catholic faith?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156">
&startq;Neither by word or action?&endq; conti|nued
the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>&startq;Never, by either!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Recollect your&s;elf,&endq; added the in|qui&s;itor.
&startq;Did you never in&s;ult there a
mini&s;ter of our mo&s;t holy church?&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;ilent: he began to perceive
the real nature of the charge which was
to be urged again&s;t him, and that it was
too plau&s;ible to permit his e&s;cape from
the puni&s;hment, which is adjudged for he|re&s;y.
Que&s;tions &s;o direct and minute had
never been put to him here on his for|mer
examinations; they had been referved
for a moment when it was believed he
could not evade them; and the real charge
had been concealed from him, that he
might not be prepared to elude it.</P>
<P>&startq;An&s;wer!&endq; repeated the inqui&s;itor;&mdash;
&startq;Did you ever in&s;ult a mini&s;ter of the
Catholic faith, in the church of the Spi|rito
Santo, at Naples?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="157">
&startq;Did you not in&s;ult him while he was
performing an act of holy penance?&endq; &s;aid
another voice.</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;tarted, for he in&s;tantly recol|lected
the well-known tones of the monk
of Paluzzi. &startq;Who a&s;ks the que&s;tion?&endq;
demanded Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;It is you who are to an&s;wer here,&endq;
re&s;umed the inqui&s;itor. &startq;An&s;wer to
what I have required.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have offended a mini&s;ter of the
church,&endq; replied Vivaldi, &startq;but never
could intentionally in&s;ult our holy reli|gion.
You are not acquainted, fathers,
with the injuries that provoked&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Enough!&endq; interrupted the inqui&s;i|tor;
&startq;&s;peak to the que&s;tion. Did you
not, by in&s;ult and menace, force a pious
brother to leave unperformed the act of
penance in which he had engaged him|&s;elf?
Did you not compel him to quit
the church, and fly for refuge to his con|vent?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">
&startq;No,&endq; replied Vivaldi. &startq;'Tis true,
he left the church, and that in con&s;e|quence
of my conduct there; but the
con&s;equence was not nece&s;&s;ary; if he had
only replied to my inquiry, or promi&s;ed
to re&s;tore her of whom he had treache|rou&s;ly
robbed me, he might have re|mained
quietly in the church till this
moment, had that depended upon my
forbearance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What!&endq; &s;aid the vicar-general,
&startq;would you have compelled him to
&s;peak, when he was engaged in &s;ilent pe|nance?
You confe&s;s, that you occa|&s;ioned
him to leave the church. That is
enough.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Where did you fir&s;t &s;ee Ellena di Ro|&s;alba?&endq;
&s;aid the voice, which had &s;poken
once before.</P>
<P>&startq;I demand again, who gives the
que&s;tion,&endq; an&s;wered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Recollect your&s;elf,&endq; &s;aid the inqui&s;i|tor,
&startq;a criminal cannot make a demand.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">
&startq;I do not perceive the connection be|tween
your admonition and your a&s;&s;er|tion,&endq;
ob&s;rved Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;You appear to be rather too much,
at your ea&s;e,&endq; &s;aid the inqui&s;itor. &startq;An|&s;wer
to the que&s;tion which was la&s;t put
to you, or the familiars &s;hall do their
duty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let the &s;ame per&s;on a&s;k it,&endq; replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion was repeated in the for|mer
voice.</P>
<P>&startq;In the church of San Lorenzo, at
Naples,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, with a heavy &s;igh,
&startq;I fir&s;t beheld Ellena di Ro&s;alba.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Was &s;he then profe&s;&s;ed?&endq; a&s;ked the
vicar general.</P>
<P>&startq;She never accepted the veil,&endq; replied
Vivaldi, &startq;nor ever intended to do &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Where did the re&s;ide at that period?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She lived with a relative at Villa Al|tieri,
and would yet re&s;ide there, had not
the machinations of a monk occa&s;ioned
<PB N="159" REF="160">
her to be torn from her Home, and Con|fined
in a convent, from which I had just
a&s;&s;i&s;ted to relea&s;e her, when &s;he was again
&s;eized, and upon a charge mo&s;t fal&s;e
and cruel.&mdash;O reverend fathers! I con|jure,
I &s;upplicate&mdash;&endq; Vivadi re&s;trained
him&s;elf, for he was going to have be|trayed,
to the mercy of inqui&s;itors, all
the feelings of his heart.</P>
<P>&startq;The name of the monk?&endq; &s;aid the
&s;tranger, earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>&startq;If I mi&s;take not,&endq; replied Vivaldi,
&startq;you are already acquainted with it.
The monk is called father Schedoni. He
is of the Dominican convent of the Spi|rito
Santo, in Naples, and the &s;ame who
accu&s;es me of having in&s;alted him in the
charch of that name.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How did you know him for your, ac|cu&s;er?&endq;
a&s;ked the &s;ame voice.</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e he is my only enemy,&endq; re|plied
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Your enemy!&endq; ob&s;erved the inqui&s;i|tor;
&startq;a former depo&s;ition &s;ays, you were
<PB N="160" REF="161">
uncon&s;cious of having one! You are in|con&s;i&s;tent
in your replies.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You were warned not to vi&s;it Villa
Altieri,&endq; &s;aid the unknown per&s;on. &startq;Why
did you not profit by the warning?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I was warned by your&s;elf,&endq; an&s;wered
Vivaldi. &startq;Now I know you well.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By me!&endq; &s;aid the &s;tranger, in a &s;o|lemn
tone.</P>
<P>&startq;By you!&endq; repeated Vivaldi: &startq;you
who al&s;o foretold the death of Signora
Bianchi; and you are that enemy&mdash;that
father Schedoni, by whom I am ac|cu&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Whence come the&s;e que&s;tions?&endq; de|manded
the vicar general. &startq;Who has
been authori&s;ed thus to interrogate the
pri&s;oner?&endq;</P>
<P>No reply was made. A bu&s;y hum of
voices from the tribunal &s;ucceeded the
&s;ilence. At length, the murmuring &s;ub|&s;ided,
and the monk's voice was heard
again.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">
&startq;I will declare thus much,&endq; it &s;aid,
addre&s;&s;ing Vivaldi; &startq;I am not father
Schedoni.&endq;</P>
<P>The peculiar tone and empha&s;is, with
which this was delivered, more than the
a&s;&s;ertion it&s;elf, per&s;uaded Vivaldi that
the &s;tanger &s;poke truth; and, though he
&s;till recognized the voice of the monk of
Paluzzi, he did not know it to be that of
Schedoni. Vivaldi was a&s;toni&s;hed! He
would have torn the veil from his eyes,
and once more viewed this my&s;terious
&s;tranger, had his hands been at liberty.
As it was, he could only conjure him to
reveal his name, and the motives for his
former conduct.</P>
<P>&startq;Who is come among&s;t us?&endq; &s;aid the
vicar general, in the voice of a per&s;on,
who means to in&s;pire in others the awe
he him&s;elf &s;uffers.</P>
<P>&startq;Who is come among&s;t us?&endq; he re|peated,
in a louder tone. Still no an|&s;wer
was returned; but again a confu&s;ed
<PB N="162" REF="163">
murmur founded from the tribunal, and a
general con&s;ternation &s;eemed to prevail.
No per&s;on &s;poke with &s;ufficient pre-emi|nence
to be under&s;tood by Vivaldi; &s;ome|thing
extraordinary appeared to be pa&s;&s;ing,
and he awaited the i&s;&s;ue with all the pa|tience
he could command. Soon after he
heard doors opened, and the noi&s;e of per|&s;ons
quitting the chamber. A deep &s;ilence
followed; but he was certain that the
familiars were &s;till be&s;ide him, waiting
to begin their work of torture.</P>
<P>After a con&s;iderable time had elap&s;ed,
Vivaldi heard foot&s;teps advancing, and a
Per&s;on give orders for his relea&s;e, that
he might be carried back to his cell.</P>
<P>When the veil was removed from his
eyes, he perceived that the tribunal was
di&s;&s;olved, and that the &s;tranger was gone.
The lamps were dying away, and the
chamber appeared more gloomily terrific
than before.</P>
<P>The familiars conducted him to the &s;pot
at which they had received him; whence
<PB N="163" REF="164">
the officers who had led him thither,
guarded him to his pri&s;on. There, &s;tretched
upon his bed of &s;traw, in &s;olitude and in
darkne&s;s, he had lei&s;ure enough to reflect
upon what had pa&s;&s;ed, and to recollect
with minute exactne&s;s every former cir|cum&s;tance
connected with the &s;tranger.
By comparing tho&s;e with the pre&s;ent, he
endeavoured to draw a more certain con|clu&s;ion
as to the identity of this per&s;on,
and his motives for the very extraordinary
conduct he had pur&s;ued. The fir&s;t ap|pearance
of this &s;tranger, among the ruins
of Paluzzi, when he had &s;aid that Vivaldi's
&s;teps were watched, and had cautioned
him again&s;t returning to Villa Altieri,
was recalled to his mind. Vivaldi re-con|&s;idered,
al&s;o, his &s;econd appearance on
the &s;ame &s;pot, and his &s;econd warning;
the circum&s;tances, which had attended his
own adventures within the fortre&s;s;&mdash;the
monk's prediction of Bianchi's death, and
his evil tidings re&s;pecting Ellena, at the
<PB N="164" REF="165">
very hour when &s;he had been &s;eized and
carried from her home. The longer he
con&s;idered the&s;e &s;everal in&s;tances, as they
were now connected in his mind, with the
certainty of Schedoni's evil di&s;po&s;ition
towards him, the more he was inclined to
believe, not with&s;tanding the voice of
&s;eeming truth which had ju&s;t affirmed the
contrary, that the unknown per&s;on was
Schedoni him&s;elf, and that he had been
employed by the Marche&s;a, to prevent
Vivaldi's vi&s;its to Villa Altieri. Being
thus an agent in the events of which he
had warned Vivaldi, he was too well
enabled to predict them. Vivaldi pau&s;ed
upon the remembrance of Signor Bianchi's
death; he con&s;idered the extraordinary
and dubious circum&s;tances that had at|tended
it, and &s;huddered as a new conjec|ture
cro&s;&s;ed his mind.&mdash;The thought was
too dreadful to be permitted, and he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
it in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>Of the conver&s;ation, however, which he
had afterwards held with the Confe&s;&s;or in
<PB N="165" REF="166">
the Marche&s;a's cabinet, he recollected
many particulars that &s;erved to renew his
doubts as to the identity of the &s;tranger;
the behaviour of Schedoni when he was
obliquely challenged for the monk of
Paluzzi, &s;till appeared that of a man un|con&s;cious
of di&s;gui&s;e; and above all, Vi|valid
was &s;truck with the &s;eeming candour
of his having pointed out a circum&s;tance,
which removed the probability that the
&s;tranger was a brother of the <HI>Santa del.
Pianto</HI></P>
<P>Some particulars, al&s;o, of the &s;tran|ger's
conduct did not agree with what
might have been expected from Sche|doni,
even though the. Confe&s;&s;or had
really been Vivaldi's enemy; a circum|&s;tance
which the latter was no longer per|mitted
to doubt. Nor did tho&s;e particular
circum&s;tanes accord, as he was inclined to
believe, with the manner of a being of
tins world; and, when Vivaldi con&s;idered
the &s;uddenne&s;s and my&s;tery, with which
<PB N="166" REF="167">
the &s;tranger had always appeared and re|tired,
he felt di&s;po&s;ed to adopt again one
of his earlie&s;t conjectures, which un|doubtedly
the horrors of his pre&s;ent abode
di&s;po&s;ed his imagination to admit, as
tho&s;e of his former &s;ituation in the vaults
of Paluzzi, together with a youthful glow
of curio&s;ity concerning the marvellous, had
before contributed to impre&s;s them upon
his mind.</P>
<P>He concluded his pre&s;ent reflections as
he bad began them&mdash;in doubt and per|plexity;
but at length found a re&s;pite
from thought and from &s;uffering in &s;leep.</P>
<P>Midnight had been pa&s;&s;ed in the vaults
of the Inqui&s;ition; but it was probably
not yet two o'clock, when he was imper|fectly
awakened by a &s;ound, which he
fancied proceeded from within his cham|ber.
He rai&s;ed him&s;elf to di&s;eover what
had occa&s;ioned the noi&s;e; it was, how|ever,
impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cern any object, for
all was dark, but he li&s;tened for a return
of the found. The wind only, was heard
<PB N="167" REF="168">
moaning amongthe inner buildings of the
pri&s;on, and Vivaldi concluded, that his
dream had mocked him with a mimic
voice.</P>
<P>Satisfied with this conclu&s;ion, he again
laid his head on his pillow of &s;traw, and
&s;oon &s;unk into a &s;lumber. The &s;ubject of
his waking thoughts &s;till haunted his ima|gination,
and the &s;tranger, who&s;e voice
he had this night recognized as that of the
monk, of Paluzzi, appeared before him.
Vivaldi, on perceiving the figure of this
Unknown, felt, perhaps, nearly the &s;ame
degrees of awe, curio&s;ity, and impatience
that he would have &s;uffered, had he beheld
the &s;ub&s;tance of this &s;hadow. The monk,
who&s;e face was &s;till &s;hrowded, he thought
advanced, till, having come within a few
paces of Vivaldi, he pau&s;ed, and, lifting
the awful cowl that had hitherto concealed
him, di&s;clo&s;ed&mdash;not the countenance of
Schedoni, but one which Vivaldi did not
recollect ever having &s;een before! It was
<PB N="168" REF="169">
not le&s;s intere&s;ting to curio&s;ity, than
&s;triking to the feelings. Vivaldi at the
fir&s;t glance &s;hrunk back;&mdash;&s;omething of
that &s;trange and inde&s;cribable air, which
we attach to the idea of a &s;upernatural
being, prevailed over the features; and
the inten&s;e and fiery eyes re&s;embled tho&s;e
of an evil &s;pirit, rather than of a human
character. He drew a poniard from be|neath
a &s;old of his garment, and, as he
di&s;played it, pointed with a &s;tern frown
to the &s;pots which di&s;coloured the blade;
Vivaldi perceived they were of blood!
He turned away his eyes in horror, and,
when he again looked round in his dream,
the figure was gone.</P>
<P>A groan awakened him, but what
were his feelings, when, on looking up,
he perceived the &s;ame figure &s;tanding
before him! It was not, however, imme|diately
that he could convince him&s;elf the
appearance was more than the phantom
of his dream, &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon an
<PB N="169" REF="170">
alarmed fancy. The voice of the monk,
for his face was as u&s;ual concealed, re|called
Vivaldi from his error; but his
emotion cannot ea&s;ily be conceived, when
the &s;tranger, &s;lowly li&s;ting that my&s;terious
cowl, di&s;covered to him the &s;ame awful
countenance, which had characterized the
vi&s;ion in his &s;lumber. Unable to inquire
the occa&s;ion of this appearance, Vivaldi
gazed in a&s;toni&s;hment and terror, and did
not immediately ob&s;erve, that, in&s;tead of
a dagger, the monk held a lamp, which
gleamed over every deep furrow of his
features, yet left their &s;hadowdy markings
to hint the pa&s;&s;ions and the hi&s;tory of an
extraordinary life.</P>
<P>&startq;You are &s;pared for this night,&endq; &s;aid
the &s;tranger, &startq;but for to-morrow&endq;&mdash;he
pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>&startq;In the name of all that is mo&s;t
&s;acred,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, endeavouring to re|collect
his thoughts, &startq;who are you, and
what is your errand?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171">
&startq;A&s;k no que&s;tions,&endq; replied the monk,
&s;olemnly;&mdash;&startq;but an&s;wer <HI>me.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;truck by the tone, with
which he &s;aid this, and dared not to urge
the inquiry at the pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>&startq;How long have you known father
Schedoni?&endq; continued the &s;tranger,
&startq;Where did you fir&s;t meet?</P>
<P>&startq;I have known him about a year, as
my mother's confe&s;&s;or,&endq; replied Vivaldi.
&startq;I fir&s;t &s;aw him in a corridor of the
Vivaldi palace; it was evening, and he
was returning from the Marche&s;a's clo&s;et.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are you certain as to this?&endq; &s;aid the
monk, with peculiar empha&s;is. &startq;It is of
con&s;equence that you &s;hould be &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am certain,&endq; repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;It is &s;trange,&endq; ob&s;erved the monk,
after a pau&s;e, &startq;that a circum&s;tance,
which mu&s;t have appeared trivial to you
at the moment, &s;hould have left &s;o &s;trong
a mark on your memory! In two years we
have time to forget many things!&endq; He
&s;ighed as he &s;poke.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172">
&startq;I remember the circum&s;tance,&endq; &s;aid
Vivaldi, &startq;becau&s;e I was &s;truk with his
appearance; the evening was far ad|vanced
&mdash;it was du&s;k, and he came upon
me &s;uddenly. His voice &s;tartled me; as
he pa&s;&s;ed he &s;aid to him&s;elf&mdash;&startq;It is for
ve&s;pers.&endq; At the &s;ame time I heard the
bell of the Spirito Santo.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you know who he is?&endq; &s;aid the
&s;tranger, &s;olemnly.</P>
<P>&startq;I know only what he appears to be,&endq;
replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Did you never hear any report of his
pa&s;t life?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never,&endq; an&s;wered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Never any thing extraordinary con|cerning
him,&endq; added the monk.</P>
<P>Vivaldi pau&s;ed a moment; for he now
recollected the ob&s;cure and imperfect &s;tory,
which Paulo had related while they were
confined in the dungeon of Paluzzi, re|&s;pecting
a confe&s;&s;ion made in the church
of the Black Penitents; but he could not
<PB N="172" REF="173">
pre&s;ume to affirm, that it concerned Sche|doni.
He remembered al&s;o the monk's
garments, &s;tained with blood, which he
had di&s;covered in the vaults of that fort.
The conduct of the mysterious being,
who now &s;tood before him, with many
other particulars of his own adventures
there, pa&s;&s;ed like a vi&s;ion over his me|mory.
His mind re&s;embled the gla&s;s of a
magician, on which the apparitions of
long-buried events ari&s;e, and as they fleet
away, point portentou&s;ly to &s;hapes half|hid
in the du&s;kine&s;s of futurity. An un|u&s;ual
dread &s;eized upon him; and a &s;uper|&s;tition,
&s;uch as he had never before ad|mitted
in an equal degree, u&s;urped his
judgment. He looked up to the &s;hadowy
countenance of the &s;tranger; and almo&s;t
believed he beheld an inhabitant of the
world of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The monk &s;poke again, repeating in a
&s;everer tone, &startq;Did you never hear any
thing extraordinary concerning father
Schedoni?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">
&startq;Is it rea&s;onable,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, recol|lecting
his courage, &startq;that I &s;hould an|&s;wer
the que&s;tions, the minute que&s;tions,
of a per&s;on who refu&s;es to tell me even
his name?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My name is pa&s;&s;ed away&mdash;it is no
more remembered,&endq; replied the &s;tranger,
turning from Vivaldi,&mdash;&startq;I leave you to
your fate.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What fate?&endq; a&s;ked Vivaldi, &startq;and
what is the purpo&s;e of this vi&s;it? I con|jure
you, in the tremendous name of the
Inqui&s;ition, to &s;ay!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will know full &s;oon; have mercy

<P>&startq;What fate?&endq; repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Urge me no further,&endq; &s;aid the
&s;tranger; &startq;but an&s;wer to&endq; what I &s;hall
demand. Schedoni&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have told all that I certainly know
concerning him,&endq; interrupted Vivaldi,
&startq;the re&s;t is only conjecture.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is that conjecture? Does it re|late
to a confe&s;&s;ion made in the church

of the Black Penitents of the Santa Ma|ria

<P>&startq;It does!&endq; replied Vivaldi with &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;What was that confe&s;&s;ion&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know not,&startq;an&s;wered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Declare the truth,&endq; &s;aid the &s;tranger,
&s;ternly.</P>
<P>&startq;A confe&s;&s;ion,&endq; replied Vivaldi, &startq;is
&s;acred, and forever buried in the bo&s;om of
the prie&s;t to whom it is made. How,
then, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that I can be
acquainted with the &s;ubject of this?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Did you never hear, that father Sche|doni
had been guilty of &s;ome great crimes,
which he endeavours to era&s;e from his
con&s;cience by the &s;everity of penance?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>

<P>&startq;Nor the means he u&s;ed&mdash;no hint of&mdash;
murder, of&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176">
The &s;tranger pau&s;ed, as if he wi&s;hed
Vivaldi to fill up his meaning, Vivaldi was
&s;ilent and agha&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;You know nothing then, of Sche|doni,&endq;
re&s;umed the monk after a deep
pau&s;e&mdash;&endq; nothing of his pa&s;t life?</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing, except what I have men|tioned,&endq;
replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Then li&s;ten to what I &s;hall unfold!&endq;
continued the monk, with &s;olemnity.
&startq;To-morrow night you will be again
carried to the place of torture; you will
be taken to a chamber beyond that in
which you were this night. You will

of which you have not now any &s;u&s;picion.
Be not di&s;mayed; I &s;hall be there, though,
perhaps, not vi&s;ible.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not vi&s;ible!&endq; exclaimed Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Interrupt me not, but li&s;ten.&mdash;When
you are a&s;ked of father Schedoni, &s;ay&mdash;
that he has lived for fifteen years in the
di&s;gui&s;e of a monk, a member of the
<PB N="176" REF="177">
Dominicans of the Spirito Santo, at Naples,
When you are a&s;ked who he is, reply&mdash;
Ferando Count di Bruno. You will be
a&s;ked the motive, for &s;uch di&s;gui&s;e. In
reply to this, refer them to the <HI>Black
Penitents</HI> of the Santa Maria del Pianto,
near that city; bid the inqui&s;itors &s;ummon
before their tribunal one father An&s;aldo di
Rovalli, the grand penitentiary of the
&s;ociety, and command him to divulge the
crimes confe&s;&s;ed to him in the year 1752,
on the evening of the twenty-fourth of
April, which was then the vigil of Santo
Marco, in a confe&s;&s;ional of the Santa
del Pianto.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is probable he may have forgotten
&s;uch confe&s;&s;ion, at this di&s;tance of time,&endq;
ob&s;erved Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Fear not but he will remember,&endq; re|plied
the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>&startq;But will his con&s;cience &s;uffer him to
betray the &s;ecrets of a confe&s;&s;ion?&endq; &s;aid
Viyaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="178">
&startq;The tribunal command, and his con|&s;cience
is ab&s;olved,&endq; an&s;wered the monk,
&startq;He may not refu&s;e to obey! You are
further to direct your examiners to &s;um|mon
father Schedoni, to an&s;wer for the
crimes which An&s;aldo &s;hall reveal.&endq;
The monk pau&s;ed, and &s;eemed waiting,
the reply of Vivaldi, who, after a mo|mentary
con&s;ideration, &s;aid.</P>
<P>&startq;How can I do all this, and upon the
in&s;tigation of a &s;tranger! Neither con|&s;cience
nor prudence will &s;uffer me to a&s;|&s;ert
what I cannot prove. It is true that I
have rea&s;on to believe Schedoni is my bit|ter
enemy, but I will not be unju&s;t even
to him. I have no proof that he is the
Count di Bruno, nor that he is the perpe|trator
of the crimes you allude to, what|ever
tho&s;e may be; and I will not be made
an in&s;trument to &s;ummon any man before
a tribunal, where innocence is no pro|tection
from ignominy, and where &s;u&s;pi|cion
alone may inflict death.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="179">
&startq;You doubt, then, the truth of what
I a&s;&s;ert?&endq; &s;aid the monk, in a haughty
tone.</P>
<P>&startq;Can I believe that of which I have
no proof?&endq; replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, there are ca&s;es which do not ad|mit
of proof; under your peculiar circum|stances,
this is one of them; you can act
only upon a&s;&s;ertion. I atte&s;t,&endq; continued
the monk, rai&s;ing his hollow voice to a
tone of &s;ingular &s;olemnity, &startq;I atte&s;t the
powers which are beyond this earth, to
witne&s;s to the truth of what I have deli|vered!&endq;</P>
<P>As the &s;tranger uttered this adjuration,
Vivaldi ob&s;erved, with emotion, the ex|traordinary
expre&s;&s;ion of his eyes; Vival|di's
pre&s;ence of mind, however, did not
for&s;ake him, and, in the next moment, he
&s;aid, &startq;But who is he that thus atte&s;ts? It
is upon the a&s;&s;ertion of a &s;tranger that I
am to rely, in defect of proof! It is a

<P>&startq;I &s;hould &s;till a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing for|ward

<P>&startq;I &s;hall do more,&endq; &s;aid the monk.</P>

<P>&startq;Aye, as a dreadful witne&s;s!&endq; replied

<P>&startq;But may not a witne&s;s &s;ummon others

<P>Vivaldi, again awed by his manner,
again ju&s;tified his refu&s;al, and concluded
with repeating his &s;urprize, that he &s;hould
be required to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this my&s;terious af|fair,
&startq;Since I neither know you, father,&endq;

the &s;tranger, frowningly; and he drew
from beneath his garment a dagger!</P>

Vivaldi remembered his dream.</P>
<P>&startq;Mark tho&s;e &s;pots,&endq; &s;aid the monk.</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked, and beheld blood!</P>
<P>&startq;This blood, added the &s;tranger, point|ing
to the blade, &startq;would have &s;aved
your's! Here is &s;ome print of truth! To|morrow
night you will meet me in the
chambers of death!&endq;</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he turned away; and,
before Vivaldi had recovered from his
con&s;ternation, the light di&s;appeared. Vi|valdi
knew that the &s;tranger had quitted
the pri&s;on, only by the &s;ilence which pre|vailed
there.</P>
<P>He remained &s;unk in thought, till, at
the dawn of day, the man, on watch, un|fa&s;tened
the door of his cell, and brought,
as u&s;ual, a jug of water, and &s;ome bread.
Vivaldi inquired the name of the &s;tranger
who had vi&s;ited him in the night. The
centinel looked &s;urprized, and Vivaldi re|peated
the que&s;tion before he could obtain
an an&s;wer.</P>

<P>Vivaldi regarded the centinel with at|tention,

<P>&startq;I have heard only the bell of San Do|minico
&s;trike upon the hour,&endq; replied the

Vivaldi, &startq;What! no foot&s;teps, no voice?&endq;</P>
<P>The man &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly.
&startq;None, but of the centinels,&endq; he replied.</P>
<P>&startq;How can you be certain you heard

<P>&startq;They &s;peak only to pa&s;s the watch

His mind deeply affected by the extra|ordinary

<P>&startq;A per&s;on, habited like a monk, came
to me in the night, &startq;re&s;umed Vivaldi,
and he de&s;cribed the appearance of the
&s;tranger. The centinel, while he li&s;tened,
became grave and thoughtful.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you know any per&s;on re&s;embling
the one I have mentioned,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;No!&endq; replied the guard.</P>
<P>&startq;Though you have not &s;een him enter
my pri&s;on,&endq; continued Vivaldi, &startq;you may,
perhaps, recollect &s;uch a per&s;on, as an in|habitant
of the Inqui&s;ition.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;San Dominico forbid!&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, &s;urprized at this exclamation,
inquired the rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>&startq;I know him not,&endq; replied the centinel,
changing countenance, and he abruptly
left the pri&s;on. Whatever con&s;ideration
might occa&s;ion this &s;udden departure,
his a&s;&s;ertion that he had been for three
<PB N="186" REF="187">
years a guard of the Inqui&s;ition could
&s;carcely be credited, &s;ince he had held
&s;o long a dialogue with a pri&s;oner, and
was, apparently, in&s;en&s;ible of the dan|ger
he incurred by &s;o doing.</P>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
<P>AT about the &s;ame hour, as on the pre|ceding
night, Vivaldi heard per&s;ons ap|proaching
his pri&s;on, and, the door un|folding,
his former conductors appeared.
They threw over him the &s;ame mantle as
before, and, in addition, a black veil,
that completely muffled his eyes; after
which, they led him from the chamber.
Vivaldi heard, the door &s;hut, on his de|parture,
and the centinels followed his
&s;teps, as if their duty was fini&s;hed, and
he was to return thither no more. At
this moment, he remembered the words
of the &s;tranger when he had di&s;played the
<PB N="188" REF="189">
poniard, and Vivaldi apprehended the
wor&s;t, from having thwarted, the de&s;igns
of a per&s;on apparently &s;o malignant: but
he exulted in the rectitude, which had pre|&s;erved
him from deba&s;ement, and, with
the magnanimous enthu&s;ia&s;m of virtue,
he almo&s;t welcomed &s;ufferings, which
would prove the firmne&s;s of his ju&s;tice
towards an enemy; for he determined to
brave every thing, rather than impute to
Schedoni circum&s;tances, the truth of
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no means of a&s;cer|taining.</P>
<P>While Vivaldi was conducted as on
the preceding night, through many pa&s;|&s;ages,
he endeavoured to di&s;cover, by
their length, and the abruptne&s;s of their
turnings, whether they were the &s;ame he
bad traver&s;ed before. Suddenly, one of
his conductors cried &startq;Steps!&endq; It was
the fir&s;t word Vivaldi had ever heard him
utter. He immediately perceived that the
ground &s;unk, and he began to de&s;cend;
<PB N="189" REF="190">
as he did which, he tried to count the
number of the &s;teps, that he might form
&s;ome judgment whether this was the flight
he had pa&s;&s;ed before. When he had
reached the bottom, he inclined to be|lieve
that it was not &s;o; and the care
which had been ob&s;erved in blinding him,
&s;eemed to indicate that he was going to
&s;ome new place.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal avenues, and
then a&s;cended; &s;oon after which, he again
de&s;cended a very long &s;tair-ca&s;e, &s;uch as
he had not any remembrance of, and they
pa&s;&s;ed over a con&s;iderable extent of level
ground. By the hollow &s;ounds which
his &s;teps returned, he judged that he was
walking over vaults. The foot&s;teps of
the centinels who had followed from the
cell were no longer heard, and he &s;eemed
to be left with his conductors only. A
&s;econd flight appeared to lead him into
Subterraneous vaults, fox he perceived the
air change, and felt a damp vapour wrap
<PB N="190" REF="191">
round him. The menace of the monk,
that he &s;hould meet him in the chambers
of death, frequently occurred to Vivaldi.</P>
<P>His conductors flopped in this vault,
and &s;eemed to hold a con&s;ultation, but
they &s;poke in &s;uch low accents, that their
words were not di&s;tingui&s;hable, except a
few unconnected ones, that hinted of
more than Vivaldi could comprehend.
He was, at length, again led forward;
and &s;oon after, he heard the heavy grating
of hinges, and perceived that he was
pa&s;&s;ing through &s;everal doors, by the &s;itu|ation
of which Vivaldi judged they were
the &s;ame he had entered the night before,
and concluded, that he was going to the
hall of the tribunal.</P>
<P>His conductors &s;topped again, and
Vivaldi heard the iron rod &s;trike three
times upon a door; immediately a &s;trange
voice &s;poke from within, and the door
was unclo&s;ed. Vivaldi pa&s;&s;ed on, and
imagined that he was admitted into a &s;pa|cious
<PB N="191" REF="192">
vault; for the air was freer, and his
&s;teps &s;ounded to a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently, a voice, as on the preceding
night, &s;ummoned him to come forward,
and Vivaldi under&s;tood that he was again
before the tribunal. It was the voice of
the inqui&s;itor who had been his chief
examiner.</P>
<P>&startq;You, Vincentio di Vivaldi,&endq; it &s;aid,
&startq;an&s;wer to your name, and to the que&s;|tions
which &s;hall be put to you, without
equivocation, on pain of the torture.&endq;</P>
<P>As the monk had predicted, Vivaldi was
a&s;ked what he knew of father Schedoni,
and, when he replied, as he had formerly
done to his my&s;terious vi&s;itor, he was
told that he knew more than he acknow|ledged.</P>
<P>&startq;I <HI>know</HI> no more,&endq; replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;You equivocate,&endq; &s;aid the inqui&s;itor.
&startq;Declare what you have heard, and re|member
that you formerly took an oath
to that purpo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193">
Vivaldi was &s;ilent, till a tremendous
voice from the tribunal commanded him
to re&s;pect his oath.</P>
<P>&startq;I do re&s;pect it,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi; &startq;and
I conjure you to believe that I al&s;o re|&s;pect
truth, when I declare, that what I
am going to relate, is a report to which
I give no confidence, and concerning even
the probability of which I cannot produce
the &s;malle&s;t proof.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Re&s;pect truth!&endq; &s;aid another voice
from the tribunal, and Vivaldi fancied he
di&s;tingui&s;hed the tones of the monk.
He pau&s;ed a moment, and the exhorta|tion
was repeated. Vivaldi then related
what the &s;tranger had &s;aid concerning the
family of Schedoni, and the di&s;gui&s;e
which the father had a&s;&s;umed in the con|vent
of the Spirito Santo; but forbore
even to name the penitentiary An&s;aldo,
and any circum&s;tance connected with the
extraordinary confe&s;&s;ion. Vivaldi con|cluded,
with again declaring, that he had
<PB N="193" REF="194">
had not &s;ufficient authority to ju&s;tify a be|lief
in tho&s;e reports.</P>
<P>&startq;On what authority do you repeat
them?&endq; &s;aid the vicar-general.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>&startq;On what authority?&endq; inquired the
inquifitor, &s;ternly.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after a momentary he&s;itation,
&s;aid, &startq;What I am about to declare, holy
fathers, is &s;o extraordinary&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tremble!&endq; &s;aid a voice clo&s;e to his
ear, which he in&s;tantly knew to be the
monk's, and the &s;uddenne&s;s of which elec|trified
him. He was unable to conclude
the &s;entence.</P>
<P>&startq;What is your authority for the re|ports?&endq;
demanded the inqui&s;iton.</P>
<P>&startq;It is unknown, even to myself!&endq;
an&s;wered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Do not equivocqte!&endq; &s;aid the vicar|general.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;olemnly prote&s;t,&endq; rejoined Vi|valdi,
&startq;that I know not either the name
<PB N="194" REF="195">
or the condition of my informer, and
that I never even beheld his face, till the
period when he &s;poke of father Schedoni.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tremble!&endq; repeated the &s;ame low,
but emphatic voice in his ear. Vivaldi
&s;tarted, and turned involuntarily towards
the found, though his eyes could not a&s;|&s;i&s;t
his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>&startq;You did well to &s;ay, that you had
&s;omething extraordinary to add,&endq; ob|&s;erved
the inqui&s;itor. &startq;'Tis evident,
al&s;o, that you expected &s;omething extra|ordinary
from your judges, &s;ince you
&s;uppo&s;ed they would credit the&s;e a&s;&s;er|tions&endq;.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was too proud to attempt the ju&s;|ti&s;ying
him&s;elf again&s;t &s;o gro&s;s an accu|&s;ation,
or to make any reply.</P>
<P>&startq;Why do you not &s;ummon father An&s;aldo?&endq;
&s;aid the voice. &startq;Remember
my words!&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, again awed by the voice, he|&s;itated,
for an in&s;tant, how to act, and
in that in&s;tant his courage returned.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196">
&startq;My informer &s;tands be&s;ide me!&endq; &s;aid
Vivaldi, boldly; &startq;I know his voice!
Detain him; it is of con&s;equence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who&s;e voice?&endq; demanded the inqui|&s;itor.
&startq;No per&s;on &s;poke but my&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who&s;e voice?&endq; &s;aid the vicar-gene|ral.</P>
<P>&startq;The voice was clo&s;e be&s;ide me,&endq; re|plied
Vivaldi. &startq;It &s;poke low, but I
knew it well.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is either the cunning, or the
frenzy of de&s;pair!&endq; ob&s;erved the vicar|general.</P>
<P>&startq;Not any per&s;on is now be&s;ide you,
except the familiars,&endq; &s;aid the inqui&s;itor,
&startq;and they wait to do their office, if you
&s;hall re&s;u&s;e to an&s;wer the que&s;tions put
to you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I per&s;i&s;t in my a&s;&s;ertion,&endq; replied Vi|valdi;
&startq;and I &s;upplicate that my eyes
may be unbound, that I may know my
enemy.&endq;</P>
<P>The tribunal, after a long private con|&s;ultation,
granted the reque&s;t; the veil
<PB N="196" REF="197">
was withdrawn, and Vivaldi, perceived
be&s;ide him&mdash;only the familiars! Their
faces, as is u&s;ual, were concealed. It
appeared that one of the&s;e torturers mu&s;t
be the my&s;terious enemy, who pur&s;ued
him, if, indeed, that enemy was an in|habitant
of the earth! and Vivaldi re|que&s;ted
that they might be ordered to
uncover their features. He was &s;ternly
rebuked for &s;o pre&s;umptuous a requi&s;ition,
and reminded of the inviolable law and
faith, which the tribunal had pledged,
that per&s;ons appointed to their awful of|fice
&s;hould never be expo&s;ed to the re|venge
of the criminal, whom it might be
their duty to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>&startq;Their duty!&endq; exclaimed Vivaldi,
thrown from his guard by &s;trong indigna|tion.
&startq;And is faith held &s;acred with de|mons!&endq;</P>
<P>Without awaiting the order of the tri|bunal,
the familiars immediately covered
Vivaldi's face with the veil, and he felt
<PB N="197" REF="198">
him&s;elf in their gra&s;p. He endeavoured,
however, to di&s;entangle his hands, and,
at length, &s;hook the&s;e men from, their
hold, and again unveiled his eyes; but
the familiars were in&s;tantly ordered to re|place
the veil.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor bade Vivaldi to recollect
in who&s;e pre&s;ence he then was, and to
dread the puni&s;hment which his re&s;i&s;tance
had incurred, and which would be in|flicted
without delay, unle&s;s he could
give &s;ome in&s;tance, that might tend to
prove the truth of his late a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>&startq;If you expect that I &s;hould &s;ay
more,&endq; replied Vivaldi, &startq;I claim, at
lea&s;t, protection from the unbidden vio|lence
of the men who guard me. If
they are &s;uffered, at their plea&s;ure, to
&s;port with the mi&s;ery of their pri&s;oner, I
will be inflexibly &s;ilent; and, &s;ince I mu&s;t
&s;uffer, it &s;hall be according to the laws
of the tribunal.&endq;</P>
<P>The vicar-general, or, as he is called,
the grand inqui&s;itor, promi&s;ed Vivaldi
<PB N="198" REF="199">
the degree of protection he claimed, and
demanded, at the &s;ame time, what were
the words he had ju&s;t heard.</P>
<P>Vivaldi con&s;idered, that, though ju&s;|tice
bade him avoid accu&s;ing an enemy
of &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, concerning
which he had no proof, yet, that neither
ju&s;tice nor common &s;en&s;e required he
&s;hould make a &s;acrifice of him&s;elf to the
dilemma, in which he was placed: he,
therefore, without further &s;cruple, ac|knowledged,
that the voice had bidden him
require of the tribunal to &s;ummon one
father An&s;aldo, the grand penitentiary
of the Santa del Pianto, near Naples,
and al&s;o father Schedoni, who was to an|&s;wer
to extraordinary charges, which
would be brought, again&s;t him by An|&s;aldo.
Vivaldi anxiou&s;ly and repeatedly
declared, that he knew not the nature of
the charges, nor that any ju&s;t grounds for
them exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions &s;eemed to throw the
tribunal into new perplexity. Vivaldi
<PB N="199" REF="200">
heard their bu&s;y voices in low debate,
which continued for a con&s;iderable time.
In this interval, he had lei&s;ure to perceive
the many improbabilities that either of the
familiars &s;hould be the &s;tranger who &s;o my|&s;teriou&s;ly
haunted him; and among the&s;e
was the circum&s;tance of his having re&s;ided
&s;o long at Naples.</P>
<P>The tribunal, after &s;ome time had
clap&s;ed in con&s;ultation, proceeded on the
examination, and Vivaldi was a&s;ked what
he knew of father An&s;aldo. He imme|diately
replied, that An&s;aldo was an utter
&s;tranger to him, and that he was not even
acquainted with a &s;ingle per&s;on re&s;iding in
the Santa del Pianto or who had any
knowledge of the penitentiary.</P>
<P>&startq;How!&endq; &s;aid the grand inqui&s;itor.
&startq;You forget that the per&s;on, who bade
you require of this tribunal to &s;ummon
An&s;aldo, has knowledge of him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon me, I do not forget,&endq; re|plied
Vivaldi; &startq;and I reque&s;t it may be
<PB N="200" REF="201">
remembered that I am not acquainted
with that per&s;on. If, therefore, he had
given me any account of An&s;aldo, I could
not have relied upon its authenticity.&endq;
Vivaldi again required of the tribunal to
under&s;tand that he did not &s;ummon An|&s;aldo,
or any other per&s;on, before them,
but had merely obeyed their command, to
repeat what the &s;tranger had &s;aid.</P>
<P>The tribunal acknowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s
of this injunction, and exculpated him from
any harm that &s;hould be the con&s;equence
of the &s;ummons. But this a&s;&s;urance of &s;afety
for him&s;elf was not &s;ufficient to appea&s;e
Vivaldi, who was alarmed le&s;t he &s;hould
be the means of bringing an innocent
per&s;on under &s;u&s;picion. The grand in|qui&s;itor
again addre&s;&s;ed him, after a gene|ral
&s;ilence had been commanded in the
court.</P>
<P>&startq;The account you have given of your
informer,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;is &s;o extraordinary,
that it would not de&s;erve credit, but that
<PB N="201" REF="202">
you have di&s;covered the utmo&s;t reluctance
to reveal the charges he gave you, from
which, it appears, that, on your part, at
lea&s;t, the &s;ummons is not malicious. But
are you certain that you have not deluded
your&s;elf, and that the voice be&s;ide you
was not an imaginary one, conjured up
by your agitated &s;pirits?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am certain,&endq; replied Vivaldi, with
firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;It is true,&endq; re&s;umed the grand inqui|&s;itor,
&startq;that &s;everal per&s;ons were near
you, when you exclaimed, that you heard
the voice of your informer; yet no per&s;on
heard it be&s;ides your&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Where are tho&s;e per&s;ons now?&endq; de|manded
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;They, are di&s;per&s;ed; alarmed at your
accu&s;ation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you will &s;ummon them,&endq; &s;aid Vi|valdi,
&startq;and order that my eyes may be
uncovered, I will point out to you, with|out
he&s;itation, the per&s;on of my informer,
&s;hould he remain among, them.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">
The tribunal commanded that they
&s;hould appear, but new difficulties aro&s;e.
It was not remembered of whom the
crowd con&s;i&s;ted; a few individuals only
were recollected, and the&s;e were &s;um|moned.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, in &s;olemn expectation, heard
&s;teps and the hum of voices gathering
round him, and impatiently awaited for
the words that would re&s;tore him to &s;ight,
and, perhaps, relea&s;e him from uncer|tainty.
In a few moments, he heard the
command given; the veil was once more
removed from his eyes, and he was or|dered
to point out the accu&s;er. Vivaldi
threw an ha&s;ty glance upon the &s;urround|ing
&s;trangers.</P>
<P>&startq;The lights burn dimly,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I
cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e faces.&endq;</P>
<P>It was ordered that a lamp &s;hould be
lowered from the roof, and that the
&s;trangers &s;hould arrange them&s;elves on ei|ther
&s;ide of Vivaldi. When this was done,
<PB N="203" REF="204">
and he glanced his eyes again upon the
crowd, &startq;He is not here!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi;
&startq;not one of the&s;e countenances re&s;em|bles
the monk of Paluzzi. Yet, &s;tay;
who is he that &s;tands in the &s;hade behind
tho&s;e per&s;ons on the left? Bid him lift
his cowl!&endq;</P>
<P>The crowd fell back, and the per&s;on, to
whom Vivaldi had pointed, was left alone
within the circle.</P>
<P>&startq;He is an officer of the Inqui&s;ition,&endq;
&s;aid a man near Vivaldi, &startq;and he may
not be compelled to di&s;cover his face, un|le&s;s
by an expre&s;s command from the tri|bunal.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I call upon the tribunal to command
it!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Who calls!&endq; exclaimed a voice, and
Vivaldi recognized the tones of the monk,
but he knew not exactly, whence they,
came.</P>
<P>&startq;I Vincentio di Vivaldi,&endq; replied the
pri&s;oner, &startq;I claim the privilege that has
<PB N="204" REF="205">
been awarded me, and bid you unveil
your countenance.&endq;</P>
<P>There was a pau&s;e of &s;ilence in the
court, except that a dull murmur ran
through the tribunal. Meanwhile, the
figure within the circle &s;tood motionle&s;s,
and remained veiled.</P>
<P>&startq;Spare him,&endq; &s;aid the man, who had
before addre&s;&s;ed Vivaldi; &startq;he has rea|&s;ons
for wi&s;hing to remain unknown,
which you cannot conjecture. He is an
officer of the Inqui&s;ition, and not the
per&s;on you apprehend.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Perhaps I <HI>can</HI> conjecture his rea|&s;ons,&endq;
replied Vivaldi, who, rai&s;ing his
voice, added, &startq;I appeal to this tribunal,
and command you, who &s;tand alone
within the circle, you in black garments,
to unveil your features!&endq;</P>
<P>Immediately a loud voice i&s;&s;ued from
the tribunal, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>&startq;We command you, in the name of
the mo&s;t holy Inqui&s;ition, to reveal your|&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206">
The &s;tranger trembled, but, without pre|&s;uming
to he&s;itate, uplifted his cowl. Vi|valdi's
eyes were eagerly fixed upon him;
but the action di&s;clo&s;ed, not the counte|nance
of the monk! but of an official
whom he recollected to have &s;een once
before, though exactly on what occa&s;ion
he did not now remember.</P>
<P>&startq;This is not my informer!&endq; &s;aid Vi|valdi,
turning from him with deep di&s;ap|pointment,
while the &s;tranger dropped his
cowl, and the crowd clo&s;ed upon him.
At the a&s;&s;ertion of Vivaldi, the members
of the tribunal looked upon each other
doubtingly, and were &s;ilent, $ill the
grand inqui&s;itor, waving his hand, as if
to command attention, addre&s;&s;ed Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;It appears, then, that you <HI>have</HI> for|merly
&s;een the face of your informer!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have already declared &s;o,&endq; replied
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>The grand inqui&s;itor demanded when,

&startq;La&s;t night, and in my pri&s;on,&endq; an|&s;wered

&s;aid another inqui&s;itor. &startq;Here is &s;ome
deception. If you, Vincentio di Vivaldi,
have a&s;&s;erted a fal&s;hood&mdash;tremble!&endq;</P>
<P>Whether Vivaldi's memory &s;till vi|brated
with the voice of the monk, or
that the tone in which this &s;ame word
was now pronounced did re&s;emble it, he
almo&s;t &s;tarted, when the inqui&s;itor had
&s;aid <HI>tremble!</HI> and he demanded who &s;poke
then.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">
&startq;It is our&s;elf,&endq; an&s;wered the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort conver&s;ation among the
members of the tribunal, the grand inqui|&s;itor
gave orders that the centinels, who
had watched on the preceding night at
the pri&s;on door of Vivaldi, &s;hould be
brought into the hall of ju&s;tice. The
per&s;ons, who had been lately &s;ummoned
into the chamber, were now bidden to
withdraw, and all further examination
was &s;u&s;pended till the arrival of the centi|nels;
Vivaldi heard only the low voices
of the inqui&s;itors, as they conver&s;ed pri|vately
together, and he remained &s;ilent,
thoughtful, and amazed.</P>
<P>When the centinels appeared, and
were a&s;ked who had entered the pri&s;on of
Vivaldi during the la&s;t night, they de|clared,
without he&s;itation, or confu&s;ion,
that not any per&s;on had pa&s;&s;ed through
the door after the hour when the pri&s;oner
had returned from examination, till the
<PB N="208" REF="209">
following morning, when the guard had
carried in the u&s;ual allowance of bread
and water. In this a&s;&s;ertion, they per|&s;i&s;ted,
without the lea&s;t equivocation,
notwith&s;tanding which they were ordered
into confinement, till the affair &s;hould
be cleared up.</P>
<P>The doubts, however, which were ad|mitted,
as to the integrity of the&s;e men,
did not contribute to di&s;&s;ipate tho&s;e, which
had prevailed over the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of
the que&s;tion. On the contrary, the &s;u&s;|picions
of the tribunal, augmenting with
their perplexity, &s;eemed to fluctuate
equally over every point of the &s;ubject
before them, till, in&s;tead of throwing
any light upon the truth, they only &s;erved
to involve the whole in deeper ob&s;curity.
More doubtful than before of the hone&s;ty
of Vivaldi's extraordinary a&s;&s;ertions, the
grand inqui&s;itor informed him, that if,
after further inquiry into this affair, it
&s;hould appear he had been trifling with
<PB N="209" REF="210">
the credulity of his judges, he would be
&s;everely puni&s;hed for his audacity; but
that, on the other hand, &s;hould there
be rea&s;on to believe that the centinels
had failed in their duty, and that &s;ome
per&s;on had entered his pri&s;on during the
night, the tribunal would proceed in a
different manner.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, perceiving that, to be believed,
it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be more cir|cum&s;tantial,
de&s;cribed, with exactne&s;s,
the per&s;on and appearance of the monk,
without, however, mentioning the po|niard
which had been exhibited. A pro|found
&s;ilence reigned in the chamber,
while he &s;poke; it &s;eemed a &s;ilence not
merely of attention, but of a&s;toni&s;hment.
Vivaldi him&s;elf was awed, and, when he
had concluded, almo&s;t expected to hear
the voice of the monk uttering defiance,
or threatening vengeance; but all re|mained
hu&s;hed, till the inqui&s;itor, who
had fir&s;t examined him, &s;aid, in a &s;olemn
tone,</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211">
&startq;We have li&s;tened with attention to
what you have delivered, and will give
the ca&s;e a full inquiry. Some points, on
which you have touched, excite our
amazement, and call for particular re|gard.
Retire whence you came&mdash;and
&s;leep this night without fear:&mdash;<HI>you will
&s;oon know more.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>Vivaldi was immediately led from the
chamber, and, &s;till blindfolded, re-con|ducted
to the pri&s;on to which he had sup|posed
it was de&s;igned he &s;hould return
no more. When the veil was with|drawn,
he perceived that his guard was
changed.</P>
<P>Again left to the &s;ilence of his cell,
he reviewed all that had pa&s;&s;ed in
the chamber of ju&s;tice; the que&s;tions
which had been put to him; the different
manners of the inqui&s;itors; the occur|rence
of the monk's voice; and the &s;imi|larity,
which he had fancied he perceived
between it and that of an inqui&s;itor, when
<PB N="211" REF="212">
the latter pronounced the word <HI>tremble;</HI>
but the con&s;ideration of all the&s;e circum|&s;tances
did not in any degree relieve him
from his perplexity. Sometimes he was
inclined to think that the monk was an
inquisitor, and the voice had more than
once appeared to proceed from the tribu|nal;
but he remembered, al&s;o, that,
more than once, it had &s;poken clo&s;e to
his ear, and he knew that a member of
this tribunal might not leave his &s;tation
during the examination of a pri&s;oner,
and that, even if he had dared to do &s;o,
his &s;ingular dre&s;s would have pointed
him out to notice, and con&s;equently to
&s;u&s;picion, at the moment when Vivaldi
had exclaimed, that he heard the voice
of his informer.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, however, could not avoid me|ditating,
with &s;urprize, on the la&s;t words
which the inqui&s;itor, who had been his
chief examiner, had addre&s;&s;ed to him,
when he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from before the
<PB N="212" REF="213">
tribunal. The&s;e were the more &s;urpriz|ing,
becau&s;e they were the fir&s;t from him
that had in any degree indicated a wi&s;h to
con&s;ole or quiet the alarm of the pri&s;o|ner;
and Vivaldi even fancied that they
betrayed &s;ome fore-knowledge that he
would not be di&s;turbed this night by the
pre&s;ence of his awful vi&s;itor. He would
entirely have cea&s;ed to apprehend, though
not to expect, had he been allowed a
light, and any weapon of defence, if, in
truth, the &s;tranger was of a nature to fear
a weapon; but, to be thus expo&s;ed to the
de&s;igns of a my&s;terious and powerful be|ing,
whom he was con&s;cious of having
offended, to &s;u&s;tain &s;uch a &s;ituation,
without &s;uffering anxiety, required &s;ome|what
more than courage, or le&s;s than
rea&s;on.</P>

<Q><L>&startq;&mdash;It came o'er my &s;oul as doth the thunder,</L>

<BIBL>CARACTACUS.</BIBL>
<P>IN con&s;equence of what had tran&s;pired at
the la&s;t examination of Vivaldi, the grand
penitentiary An&s;aldo, together with the
father Schedoni, were cited to appear be|fore
the table of the holy office.</P>
<P>Schedoni was arre&s;ted on his way to
Rome, whither he was going privately to
make further efforts for the liberation of
Vivaldi, who&s;e relea&s;e he had found it
more difficult to effect, than his impri&s;on|ment;
the per&s;on upon who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance
the Confe&s;&s;or relied in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,
having boa&s;ted of more influence than he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or perhaps thought it prudent
<PB N="214" REF="215">
to exert. Schedoni had been the more
anxious to procure an immediate relea&s;e
for Vivaldi, le&s;t a report of his &s;ituation
&s;hould reach his family, notwith&s;tanding
the precautions, which are u&s;ually em|ployed
to throw an impenetrable &s;hrowd
over the pri&s;oners of this dreadful tribu|nal,
and bury them for ever from the
knowledge of their friends. Such prema|ture
di&s;covery of Vivaldi's circum&s;tances,
Schedoni apprehended might include al&s;o
a di&s;covery of the per&s;ecutor, and draw
down upon him&s;elf the abhorrence and
the vengeance of a family, whom it was
now, more than ever, his wi&s;h and his
intere&s;t to conciliate. It was &s;till his in|tention,
that the nuptials of Vivaldi and
Ellena &s;hould be privately &s;olemnized
immediately on the relea&s;e of the pri&s;oner,
who, even if he had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect
Schedoni for his late per&s;ecutor, would
then be intere&s;ted in concealing his &s;u&s;pi|cions
for ever, and from whom therefore,
no evil was to be apprehended.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="216">
How little did Vivaldi fore&s;ee, that
in repeating to the tribunal the &s;tran|ger's
&s;ummons of father Schedoni, he
was deferring, or, perhaps, wholly pre|venting
his own marriage with Ellena
di Ro&s;alba! How little, al&s;o, did he
apprehend what would be the further
con&s;equences of a di&s;clo&s;ure, which the
peculiar circum&s;tances of his &s;ituation
had hardly permitted him to withhold,
though, could he have under&s;tood the
probable event of it, he would have
braved all the terrors of the tribunal, and
death it&s;elf, rather than incur the remor&s;e
of having promoted it.</P>
<P>The motive for his arre&s;tation was
concealed from Schedoni, who had not
the remote&s;t &s;u&s;picion of its nature, but
attributed the arre&s;t, to a di&s;covery, which
the tribunal had made of his being the
accu&s;er of Vivaldi. This di&s;clo&s;ure he
attributed to his own imprudence, in
having &s;tated, as an in&s;tance of Vivaldi's
<PB N="216" REF="217">
contempt for the Catholic faith, that he
had in&s;ulted a prie&s;t while doing penance
in the church of the Spirito Santo. But
by what art the tribunal had di&s;covered
that he was the prie&s;t alluded to, and the
author of the accu&s;ation, Schedoni could
by no means conjecture. He was willing
to believe that this arre&s;t was only for the
purpo&s;e of obtaining proof of Vivaldi's
guilt; and the Confe&s;&s;or knew that he
could &s;o conduct him&s;elf in evidence, as
in all probability to exculpate the pri&s;oner,
from whom, when he &s;hould explain him|&s;elf,
no re&s;entment on account of his for|mer
conduct was to be apprehended. Yet
Schedoni was not perfectly at ca&s;e; for it
was po&s;&s;ible that a knowledge of Vivaldi's
&s;ituation, and of the author of it, had
reached his family, and had produced his
own arre&s;t. On this head, however, his
fears were not powerful; &s;ince, the longer
he dwelt upon the &s;ubject, the more impro|bable
it appeared that &s;uch a di&s;clo&s;ure.
<PB N="217" REF="218">
at lea&s;t &s;o far as it related to him&s;elf, could
have been affected.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, from the night of his late exa|mination,
was not called upon, till Sche|doni
and father An&s;aldo appeared together
in the hall of the tribunal. The two
latter had already been &s;eparately exa|mined,
and An&s;aldo had privately &s;tated
the particulars of the confe&s;&s;ion he had
received on the vigil of the Santo Marco,
in the year 1752, for which di&s;clo&s;ure he
had received formal ab&s;olution. What
had pa&s;&s;ed at that examination does not
appear, but on this his &s;econd interroga|tion,
he was required to repeat the &s;ubject
and the circum&s;tances of the confe&s;&s;ion.
This was probably with a view of ob&s;er|ving
its effect upon Schedoni and on Vi|valdi,
which would direct the opinion of
the tribunal as to the guilt of the Confe&s;&s;or,
and the veracity of the young pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>On this night a very exact inquiry was
made, concerning every per&s;on, who had
<PB N="218" REF="219">
obtained admi&s;&s;ion into the hall of ju&s;|tice;
&s;uch officials as were not im|mediately
nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the cere|monies
of the tribunal were excluded,
together with every other per&s;on belong|ing
to the Inqui&s;ition not material to the
evidence, or to the judges. When this
&s;crutiny was over, the pri&s;oners were
brought in, and their conductors ordered
to withdraw. A &s;ilence of &s;ome moments
prevailed in the hall; and, however dif|ferent
might be the reflections of the
&s;everal pri&s;oners, the degree of anxious
expectation was in each, probably, nearly
the &s;ame,</P>
<P>The grand-vicar having &s;poken a few
words in private to a per&s;on on his left
hand, an inqui&s;itor ro&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;If any per&s;on in this court,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;is known by the name of father Sche|doni,
belonging to the Dominican &s;ociety
of the Spirito Santo at Naples, let him
appear!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220">
Schedoni an&s;wered to the &s;ummons.
He came forward with a firm &s;tep, and,
having cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and bowed to the
tribunal, awaited in &s;ilence its commands.</P>
<P>The penitentiary An&s;aldo was next
called upon. Vivaldi ob&s;erved that he
faultered as he advanced; and that his
obei&s;ance to the tribunal was more pro|found
than Schedoni's had been. Vivaldi
him&s;elf was then &s;ummoned; his air was
calm and dignified, and his countenance
expre&s;&s;ed the &s;olemn energy of his feelings,
but nothing of dejection.</P>
<P>Schedoni and An&s;aldo were now, for
the fir&s;t time, confronted. Whatever
might be the feelings of Schedoni on be|holding
the penitentiary of the <HI>Santa del
Pianto,</HI> he effectually concealed them.</P>
<P>The grand-vicar him&s;elf opened the
examination, &startq;You, father Schedoni, of
the Spirito Santo,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;an&s;wer and
&s;ay, whether the per&s;on who now &s;tands
before you, bearing the title of grand
<PB N="220" REF="221">
penitentiary of the order of the <HI>Black
Penitents,</HI> and pre&s;iding over the convent
of the <HI>Santa Maria del Pianto</HI> at Naples, is
known to you.</P>
<P>To this requi&s;ition Schedoni replied with
firmne&s;s in the negative.</P>
<P>&startq;You have never, to your knowledge,
&s;een him before this hour?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never!&endq; &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Let the oath be admini&s;tered,&endq; added
the grand-vicar. Schedoni having ac|cepted
it; the &s;ame que&s;tions were put to
An&s;aldo concerning the Confe&s;&s;or, when,
to the a&s;toni&s;hment of Vivaldi and of the
greater part of the court, the penitentiary
denied all knowledge of Schedoni. His
negative was given, however, in a le&s;s
deci&s;ive manner than that of the Confe&s;&s;or,
and when the u&s;ual oath was offered,
An&s;aldo declined to accept it.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was next called upon to identify
Schedoni&punc; he declared, that the per&s;on
who was then pointed out to him, he had
<PB N="221" REF="222">
never known by any other denomination
than that of father Schedoni; and that he
had always under&s;tood him to be a monk
of the Spirito Santo; but Vivaldi was at
the &s;ame time careful to repeat, that he
knew nothing further relative to his life.</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;omewhat &s;urprized at
this apparent candour of Vivaldi towards
him|&s;elf, but accu&s;tomed to impute an evil
motive to all conduct, which he could not
clearly comprehend, he did not &s;cruple to
believe, that &s;ome latent mi&s;chief was
directed again&s;t him in this &s;eemingly
hone&s;t declaration.</P>
<P>After &s;ome further preliminary forms
had pa&s;&s;ed, An&s;aldo was ordered to relate
the particulars of the confe&s;&s;ion, which
had been made to him on the eve of the
Santo Marco. It mu&s;t be remembered,
that this was &s;till what is called in the
Inqui&s;ition, a <HI>private</HI> examination.</P>
<P>After he had taken the cu&s;tomary oaths
to relate neither more nor le&s;s than the
<PB N="222" REF="223">
truth of what had pa&s;&s;ed before him, An|saldo's
depo&s;itions were written down
nearly in the following words; to which
Vivaldi li&s;tened with almo&s;t trembling at|tention,
for, be&s;ides the curio&s;ity which
&s;ome previous circum&s;tances had excited
re&s;pecting them, he believed that his own
fate in a great mea&s;ure depended upon a
di&s;covery of the fact to which they led.
What, if he had &s;urmi&s;ed how much! and
that the per&s;on, whom he had been in
&s;ome degree in&s;trumental in citing before
this tremendous tribunal, was the father
of his Ellena di Ro&s;alba!</P>
<P>An&s;aldo, having again an&s;wered to his
name and titles, gave his depo&s;ition as
follows:</P>
<P>&startq;It was on the eve of the twenty|fifth
of April, and in the year 1752, that
as I &s;at, according to my cu&s;tom, in the
confe&s;&s;ional of San Marco, I was alarm|ed
by deep groans, which came from the
box on my left hand.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="224">
Vivaldi ob&s;erved, that the date now
mentioned agreed with that recorded by
the &s;tranger, and he was thus prepared
to believe what might follow, and to give
his confidence to this extraordinary and
un&s;een per&s;onage.</P>
<P>An&s;aldo continued, &startq;I was the more
alarmed by the&s;e &s;ounds, becau&s;e I had
not been prepared for them; I knew not
that any per&s;on was in the confe&s;&s;ional,
nor had even ob&s;erved any one pa&s;s along
the ai&s;le&mdash;but the du&s;kine&s;s of the hour
may account for my having failed to do
&s;o; it was after &s;un-&s;et, and the tapers at
the &s;hrine of San Antonio as yet burned
feebly in the twilight.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Be brief, holy father,&endq; &s;aid the in|qui&s;itor
who had formerly been mo&s;t ac|tive
in examining Vivaldi; &startq;&s;peak clo&s;ely
to the point.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The groans would &s;ometimes cea&s;e,&endq;
re&s;umed An&s;aldo, &startq;and long pau&s;es of
&s;ilence follow; they were tho&s;e of a &s;oul
<PB N="224" REF="225">
in agony, &s;truggling with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of guilt, yet wanting re&s;olution to confe&s;s
it. I tried to encourage the penitent, and
held forth every hope of mercy and for|givene&s;s
which my duty would allow,
but for a con&s;iderable time without effect;&mdash;
the enormity of the &s;in &s;eemed too big
for utterance, yet the penitent appeared
equally unable to endure the concealment
of it. His heart was bur&s;ting with the
&s;ecret, and required the comfort of ab|solution,
even at the price of the &s;evere&s;t
penance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Facts!&endq; &s;aid the inqui&s;itor, &startq;the&s;e
are are only &s;urmi&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Facts will come full &s;oon!&endq; replied
An&s;aldo, and bowed his head, &startq;the men|tion
of them will petrify you, holy fathers!
as they did me, though not for the &s;ame
rea&s;ons. While I endeavoured to encou|rage
the penitent, and a&s;&s;ured him, that
ab&s;olution &s;hould follow the acknowledg|ment
of his crimes, however heinous tho&s;e
<PB N="225" REF="226">
crimes might be, if accompanied by &s;in|cere
repentance, he more than once began
his confe&s;&s;ion, and abruptly dropt it.
Once, indeed, he quitted the confe&s;&s;ional;
his agitated &s;pirit required liberty; and it
was then, as he walked with perturbed
&s;teps along the ai&s;le, that I fir&s;t ob&s;erved
his figure. He was in the habit of a white
friar, and, as nearly as I can recollect,
was about the &s;tature of him, the father
Schedoni, who now &s;tands before me.&endq;</P>
<P>As An&s;aldo delivered the&s;e words, the
attention of the whole tribunal was turned
upon Schedoni, who &s;tood unmoved, and
with his eyes bent towards the ground.</P>
<P>&startq;His face,&endq; continued the penitentiary,
&startq;I did not fee; he was, with good rea&s;on,
careful to conceal it; other re&s;emblance,
therefore, than the &s;tature, I cannot
point out between them. The voice, in|deed,
the voice of the penitent, I think I
&s;hall never forget; I &s;hould know it again
at any di&s;tance of time.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="227">
&startq;Has it not &s;truck your ear, &s;ince you
came within the&s;e walls?&endq; &s;aid a member
of the tribunal.</P>
<P>&startq;Of that hereafter,&endq; ob&s;erved the in|qui&s;itor, &startq;you wander from the point,
father.&endq;</P>
<P>The vicar-general remarked, that the
circum&s;tances ju&s;t related were important,
and ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed over as irrele|vant.
The inqui&s;itor &s;ubmitted to this
opinion, but objected that they were not
pertinent to the moment; and An&s;aldo
was again bidden to repeat what he had
heard at confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;When the &s;tranger returned to the
&s;teps of the confe&s;&s;ional, he had acquired
&s;ufficient re&s;olution to go through with the
ta&s;k he had impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf, and
a thrilling voice &s;poke through the grate
the facts I am about to relate.&endq;</P>
<P>Father An&s;aldo pau&s;ed, and was some|what
agitated; he &s;eemed endeavouring
to recollect courage to go through with
<PB N="227" REF="228">
what he had begun. During this pau&s;e,
the &s;ilence of expectation rapt the court,
and the eyes of the tribunal were directed
alternately to An&s;aldo and Schedoni, who
certainly required &s;omething more than
human firmne&s;s to &s;upport unmoved the
&s;evere &s;crutiny, and the yet &s;everer &s;u&s;pi|cions,
to which he &s;tood expo&s;ed. Whe|ther,
however, it was the fortitude of
con&s;cious innocence, or the hardihood of
atrocious vice, that protected the Confe&s;&s;or,
he certainly did not betray any emotion.
Vivaldi, who had uncea&s;ingly ob&s;erved
him from the commencement of the de|po&s;itions,
felt inclined to believe that he
was not the penitent de&s;cribed. An&s;aldo,
having, at length, recollected him&s;elf,
proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>&startq;I have been through life,&endq; &s;aid the
penitent, &startq;the &s;lave of my pa&s;&s;ions, and
they have led me into horrible exce&s;&s;es. I
had once a brother!&endq;&mdash;He &s;topped, and deep
groans again told the agony of his &s;oul;
<PB N="228" REF="229">
at length, he added&mdash;&startq;That brother
had a wife!&mdash;Now li&s;ten, father, and &s;ay,
whether guilt like mine may hope for ab|solution!
She was beautiful&mdash;I loved her;
&s;he was virtuous, and I de&s;paired. You,
father,&endq; he continued in a frightful tone,
'never knew the fury of de&s;pair! It
overcame or communicated its own force
to every other pa&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, and I
&s;ought to relea&s;e my&s;elf from its tortures
by any means. My brother died!'&mdash;The
penitent pau&s;ed again,&endq; continued An&s;aldo,
&startq;I trembled while I li&s;tened; my lips were
&s;ealed. At length, I bade him proceed,
and he &s;poke as follows.&mdash;'My brother died
at a di&s;tance from home.'&mdash;Again the peni|tent,
pau&s;ed, and the &s;ilence continued &s;o
long, that I thought it proper to inquire
of what di&s;order the brother had expired.
&startq;Father, I was his murderer!&endq; &s;aid the pe|nitent
in a voice which I never can forget;
it &s;unk into my heart.&endq;</P>
<P>An&s;aldo appeared affected by the re|membrance,
and was for a moment &s;ilent.
<PB N="229" REF="230">
At the la&s;t words Vivaldi had particularly
noticed Schedoni, that he might judge by
their effect upon him, whether he was
guilty; but he remained in his former atti|tude,
and his eyes were &s;till fixed upon the
ground.</P>
<P>&startq;Proceed, father!&endq; &s;aid the inqui&s;itor,
&startq;what was your reply to this confe&s;&s;ion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I was &s;ilent,&endq; &s;aid An&s;aldo &startq;but at
length I bade the penitent go on. &startq;I con|trived
&s;aid he, that my brother &s;hould die
at a di&s;tance from home, and I &s;o con|ducted
the affair, that his widow never
&s;u&s;pected the cau&s;e of his death. It was not
till long after the u&s;ual time of mourning
had expired, that I ventured to &s;olicit her
hand: but &s;he had not yet forgotten my
brother, and &s;he rejected me. My pa&s;&s;ion
would no longer be trifled with. I cau&s;ed
her to be carried from her hou&s;e, and &s;he
was afterwards willing to retrieve her
honour by the marriage vow. I had &s;a|crificed
my con&s;cience, without having
<PB N="230" REF="231">
&s;ound happine&s;s;&mdash;&s;he did not even
conde&s;cend to conceal her di&s;dain. Mor|tified,
exa&s;perated by her conduct, I be|gun
to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome other emotion
than re&s;entment occa&s;ioned this di&s;dain;
and la&s;t of all jealou&s;y&mdash;jealou&s;y came to
crown my mifery&mdash;to light up all my pa&s;|&s;ions
into madne&s;s!'</P>
<P>&startq;The penitent,&endq; added An&s;aldo, &startq;ap|peared
by the manner in which he uttered
this, to be nearly frantic at the moment,
and convul&s;ive &s;obs &s;oon &s;tifled his words.
When he re&s;umed his confe&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid,
'I &s;oon &s;ound an object for my jealou&s;y.
Among the few per&s;ons, who vi&s;ited us in
the retirement of our country re&s;idence,
was a gentleman, who, I fancied, loved
my wife; I fancied too, that, whenever he
appeared, an air of particular &s;atisfaction
was vi&s;ible on her countenance. She
&s;eemed to have plea&s;ure in conver&s;ing;
with, and &s;hewing him di&s;tinction. I even
&s;ometimes thought, &s;he had pride in di&s;|playing
<PB N="231" REF="232">
to me the pre&s;erence &s;he enter|tained
for him, and that an air of triumph,
and even of &s;corn, was addre&s;&s;ed to me,
whenever &s;he mentioned his name. Per|haps,
I mi&s;took re&s;entment for love, and
&s;he only wi&s;hed to puni&s;h me, by exciting
my jealou&s;y. Fatal error! &s;he puni&s;hed
her&s;elf al&s;o!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Be le&s;s circum&s;tantial, father,&endq; &s;aid
the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>An&s;aldo bowed his head, and continued.
&startq;One evening,&endq; continued the penitent,
'that I returned home unexpectedly, I was
told that a vi&s;itor was with my wife! As I
approached the apartment where they &s;at,
I heard the voice of Sacchi; it &s;eemed
mournful and &s;upplicating. I &s;topped to
li&s;ten, and di&s;tingui&s;hed enough to fire
me with vengeance. I re&s;trained my&s;elf,
however, &s;o far as to &s;tep &s;oftly to a lattice
that opened from the pa&s;&s;age, and over|looked
the apartment. The traitor was
on his knee before her. Whether &s;he had
<PB N="232" REF="233">
heard my &s;tep, or ob&s;erved my face,
through the high lattice, or that &s;he re|&s;ented
his conduct, I know not, but &s;he
ro&s;e immediately from her chair. I did
not pau&s;e to que&s;tion her motive; but,
&s;eizing my &s;tiletto, I ru&s;hed into the
room, with intent to &s;trike it to the vil|lain's
heart. The &s;uppo&s;ed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of my
honour e&s;caped into the garden, and was
heard of no more.'&mdash;But your wife? &s;aid
I. &startq;Her bo&s;om received the poniard!&endq;
replied the penitent.&endq;</P>
<P>An&s;aldo's voice faultered, as he repeat|ed
this part of the confe&s;&s;ion, and he was
utterly unable to proceed. The tribunal,
ob&s;erving his condition, allowed him a
chair, and, after a &s;truggle of &s;ome mo|ments,
he added, &startq;Think, holy fathers,
O think! what mu&s;t have been my feel|ings
at that in&s;tant! I was my&s;elf the lo|ver
of the woman, whom he, confe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to have murdered.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Was &s;he innocent?&endq; &s;aid a voice;
and Vivaldi, who&s;e attention had latterly
<PB N="233" REF="234">
been fixed upon An&s;aldo, now, on look|ing,
at Schedoni, perceived that it was he
who had &s;poken. At the &s;ound of his
voice, the penitentiary turned in&s;tantly
towards him. There was a pau&s;e of ge|neral
&s;ilence, during which An&s;aldo's eyes
were earne&s;tly fixed upon the accu&s;ed.
At length, he &s;poke, &startq;She was inno|cent!&endq;
He replied, with &s;olemn empha|&s;is,
&startq;She was mo&s;t virtuous!&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni had &s;hrunk back within him|&s;elf;
he a&s;ked no further. A murmur
ran through the tribunal, which ro&s;e by
degrees, till it broke forth into audible
conver&s;ation; at length, the &s;ecretary was
directed to note the que&s;tion of Sche|doni.</P>
<P>&startq;Was that the voice of the penitent,
which you have ju&s;t heard?&endq; demanded
the inqui&s;itor of An&s;aldo. &startq;Remember,
you have &s;aid that you &s;hould know it
again!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I think it was,&endq; replied An&s;aldo:
&startq;but I cannot &s;wear to that.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">
&startq;What infirmity of judgment is this!&endq;
&s;aid the &s;ame inqui&s;itor, who him&s;elf was
&s;eldom troubled with the mode&s;ty of
doubt, upon any &s;ubject. An&s;aldo was
bidden to re&s;ume the narrative.</P>
<P>&startq;On this di&s;covery of the murderer,&endq;
&s;aid the penitentiary, &startq;I quitted the con|fe&s;&s;ional,
and my &s;en&s;es for&s;ook me before
I could deliver orders for the detection of
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. When I recovered, it was
too late; he had e&s;caped! From that
hour to the pre&s;ent, I have never &s;een
him, nor dare I affirm that the per&s;on
now before me is he.&endq;</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor was about to &s;peak, but
the grand-vicar waved his hand, as a &s;ig|nal
for attention, and, addre&s;&s;ing An|&s;aldo,
&s;aid, &startq;Although you may be un|acquainted
with Schedoni, the monk of
the Spirito Santo, reverend father, can
you not recollect the per&s;on of the Count
di Bruno, your former friend?&endq;</P>
<P>An&s;aldo again looked at Schedoni, with
a &s;erutinizing eye; he fixed it long; but
<PB N="235" REF="236">
the countenance of Schedoni &s;uffered no
change.</P>
<P>&startq;No!&endq; &s;aid the penitentiary, at length,
&startq;I dare not take upon me to a&s;&s;ert, that
this is the Count di Bruno. If it is he,
years have wrought deeply on his fea|tures.
That the penitent was the Count
di Bruno I have proof; he mentioned my
name as his vi&s;itor, and particular cir|cum&s;tances
known only to the Count and
my&s;elf; but that father Schedoni was the
penitent, I repeat it, I dare not affirm.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But that dare I!&endq; &s;aid another voice;
and Vivaldi, turning towards it, beheld
the my&s;terious &s;tranger advancing, his
cowl now thrown back, and an air of
menace over&s;preading every terrific fea|ture.
Schedoni, in the in&s;tant that he
perceived him, &s;eemed agitated; his coun|tenance,
for the fir&s;t time, &s;uffered &s;ome
change.</P>
<P>The tribunal was profoundly &s;ilent, but
&s;urprize, and a kind of re&s;tle&s;s expecta|tion,
<PB N="236" REF="237">
marked every brow. Vivaldi was
about to exclaim, &startq;That is my infor|mer!&endq;
when the voice of the &s;tranger
checked him.</P>
<P>&startq;Do&s;t thou know me?&endq; &s;aid he,
&s;ternly, to Schedoni, and his attitude be|came
fixed.</P>
<P>Schedoni gave no reply</P>
<P>&startq;Do&s;t thou know me?&endq; repeated his
accu&s;er, in a &s;teady &s;olemn voice.</P>
<P>&startq;Know thee!&endq; uttered Schedoni,
faintly</P>
<P>&startq;Do&s;t thou know this?&endq; cried the
&s;tranger, rai&s;ing his voice, as he drew
from his garment what appeared to be a
dagger. &startq;Do&s;t thou know the&s;e indeli|ble
&s;tains?&endq; &s;aid he, lifting the poniard,
and, with an out&s;tretched arm, pointing
it towards Schedoni.</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or turned away his face;
it &s;eemed as if his heart &s;ickened.</P>
<P>&startq;With this dagger was thy brother
&s;lain!&endq; &s;aid the terrible &s;tranger. &startq;Shall
I declare my&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238">
Schedoni's courage for&s;ook him, and
he &s;unk again&s;t a pillar of the hall for
&s;upport.</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation was how general;
the extraordinary appearance and conduct
of the &s;tranger &s;eemed to &s;trike the greater
part of the tribunal, a tribunal of the in|qui&s;ition
it&s;elf! with di&s;may. Several of
the members ro&s;e from their &s;eats; others
called aloud for the officials, who kept
guard at the doors of the hall, and inqui|red
who had admitted the &s;tranger, while
the vicar-general and a few inqui&s;itors
conver&s;ed privately together, during which
they frequently looked at the &s;tranger and
at Schedoni, as if they were the &s;ubjects
of the di&s;cour&s;e. Meanwhile the monk
remained with the dagger in his gra&s;p,
and his eyes fixed on the Confe&s;&s;or, who&s;e
face was &s;till averted, and who yet &s;up|ported
him&s;elf again&s;t the pillar.</P>
<P>At length, the vicar-general called up|on
the members who had ari&s;en to return
<PB N="238" REF="239">
to their &s;eats, and ordered that the offi|cials
&s;hould withdraw to their po&s;ts.</P>
<P>&startq;Holy brethren!&endq; &s;aid the vicar, &startq;we
recommend to you, at this important hour,
&s;ilence and deliberation. Let the exami|nation
of the accu&s;ed proceed; and here|after
let us inquire as to the admittance of
the accu&s;er. For the pre&s;ent, &s;uffer him
al&s;o to have hearing, and the father Sche|doni
to reply.</P>
<P>&startq;We &s;uffer him!&endq; an&s;wered the tri|bunal,
and bowed their heads.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who, during the tumult, had
ineffectually endeavoured to make him|&s;elf
heard, now profited by the pau&s;e
which followed the a&s;&s;ent of the inqui&s;i|tors,
to claim attention: but the in&s;tant
he &s;poke &s;everal members impatiently
bade that the examination &s;hould pro|ceed,
and the grand-vicar was again
obliged to command &s;ilence, before the
reque&s;t of Vivaldi could be under&s;tood.
Permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak being granted him,
<PB N="239" REF="240">
&startq;That per&s;on,&endq; &s;aid he, pointing to the
&s;tranger, &startq;is the &s;ame who vi&s;ited me in
my pri&s;on; and the dagger the &s;ame he
now di&s;plays! It was he, who com|manded
me to &s;ummon the penitentiary
An&s;aldo, and the father Schedoni. I have
acquitted my&s;elf, and have nothing fur|ther
to do in this &s;truggle.&endq;</P>
<P>The tribunal was again agitated, and
the murmurs of private conver&s;ation again
prevailed. Meanwhile Schedoni appeared
to have recovered &s;ome degree of &s;elf-com|mand;
he rai&s;ed him&s;elf, and, bowing to
the tribunal, &s;eemed preparing to &s;peak;
but waited till the confu&s;ion of &s;ound that
filled the hall &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide. At length
he could be heard, and, addre&s;&s;ing the
tribunal, he &s;aid,</P>
<P>Holy fathers! the &s;tranger who is
now before you is an impo&s;tor! I will
prove that my accu&s;er was once my friend;
&mdash;you may perceive how much the di&s;|covery
of his perfidy affects me. The
<PB N="240" REF="241">
charge he brings is mo&s;t fal&s;e and mali|cious!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Once</HI> thy friend!&endq; replied the &s;tran|ger,
with peculiar empha&s;is, &startq;and what
has made me thy enemy! View the&s;e
&s;pots,&endq; he continued, pointing to the
blade of the poniard, &startq;are they al&s;o
fal&s;e and malicious? are they not, on the
contrary, reflected on thy con&s;cience?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know them not,&endq; replied Schedoni,
&startq;my con&s;cience is un&s;tained.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A brother's blood <HI>has</HI> &s;tained it!&endq;
&s;aid the &s;tranger, in a hollow voice.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who&s;e attention was now fixed
upon Schedoni, ob&s;erved a livid hue over|&s;pread
his complexion, and that his eyes
were averted from this extraordinary per|&s;on
with horror: the &s;pectre of his de|cea&s;ed
brother could &s;carcely have called
forth a &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ion. It was not
immediately that he could command his
voice; when he could, he again appealed
to the tribunal.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="242">
&startq;Holy fathers!&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;&s;uffer me
to defend my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Holy fathers!&endq; &s;aid the accu&s;er, with
&s;olemnity, &startq;hear! hear what I &s;hall un|fold!&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni, who &s;eemed to &s;peak by a
&s;trong effort only, again addre&s;&s;ed the in|qui&s;itors;
&startq;I will prove,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;that
this evidence is not of a nature to be
tru&s;ted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will bring <HI>&s;uch</HI> proof to the con|trary!&endq;
&s;aid the monk. &startq;And here,&endq;
pointing to An&s;aldo, &startq;is &s;ufficient te&s;ti|mony
that the Count di Bruno did confe&s;s
him&s;elf guilty of murder.&endq;</P>
<P>The court commanded &s;ilence, and
upon the appeal of the &s;tranger to An|&s;aldo,
the penitentiary was a&s;ked whether
he knew him. He replied, that he did
not.</P>
<P>&startq;Recollect your&s;elf,&endq; &s;aid the grand
inqui&s;itor, &startq;it is of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence
that you &s;hould be correct on this
point.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="243">
The penitentiary ob&s;erved the &s;tranger
with deep attention, and then repeated
his a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>&startq;Have you never &s;een him before?&endq;
&s;aid an inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>&startq;Never, to my knowledge!&endq; replied
An&s;aldo.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itors looked upon each other
in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>&startq;He &s;peaks the truth,&endq; &s;aid the &s;tran|ger.</P>
<P>This extraordinary fact did not fail to
&s;trike the tribunal, and to a&s;toni&s;h Vi|valdi.
Since the accu&s;er confirmed it,
Vivaldi was at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand the
means by which he could have become
acquainted with the guilt of Schedoni,
who, it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, would
have acknowledged crimes of &s;uch mag|nitude
as tho&s;e contained in the accu&s;a|tion,
to any per&s;on, except, indeed, to
his confe&s;&s;or, and this confe&s;&s;or, it ap|peared,
was &s;o far from having betrayed
<PB N="243" REF="244">
his tru&s;t to the accu&s;er, that he did not
even know him Vivaldi was no le&s;s
perplexed as to what would be the nature
of the testimony, with which the accu&s;er
de&s;igned to &s;upport his charges: but the
pau&s;e of general amazement, which had
permitted Vivaldi the&s;e con&s;iderations,
was now at an end; the tribunal re&s;umed
the examination, and the grand inqui&s;i|tor
called aloud,</P>
<P>&startq;You, Vincentio di Vivaldi, an&s;wer
with exactne&s;s to the que&s;tions that &s;hall
be put to you.&endq;</P>
<P>He was then a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions rela|tive
to the per&s;on, who had vi&s;ited him
in pri&s;on. In his an&s;wers, Vivaldi was
clear and conci&s;e, con&s;tantly affirming, that
the &s;tranger was the &s;ame, who now ac|cu&s;ed
Schedoni.</P>
<P>When the accu&s;er was interrogated, he
acknowledged, without he&s;itation, that
Vivaldi had &s;poken the truth. He was
then a&s;ked his motive for that extraordi|nary
vi&s;it.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="245">
&startq;It was,&endq; replied the monk, &startq;that a
murderer might be brought to ju&s;tice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This,&endq; ob&s;erved the grand inqui&s;itor,
&startq;might have been accompli&s;hed by fair
and open accu&s;a&s;ion. If you had known
the charge to be ju&s;t, it is probable that
you would have appealed directly to this
tribunal, in&s;tead of endeavouring in&s;idi|ou&s;ly
to obtain an influence over the mind
of a pri&s;oner, and urging him to become
the in&s;trument of bringing the accu&s;ed to
puni&s;hment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yet I have not &s;hrunk from di&s;co|very,&endq;
ob&s;erved the &s;tranger, calmly;
&startq;I have voluntarily appeared.&endq;</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, Schedoni &s;eemed again
much agitated, and even drew his hood
over his eyes.</P>
<P>&startq;That is ju&s;t,&endq; &s;aid the grand inqui&s;i|tor,
addre&s;&s;ing the &s;tranger: &startq;but you
have neither declared your name, or
whence you come!&endq;</P>
<P>To this remark the monk made no re|ply;
but Schedoni, with reviving &s;pirit,
<PB N="245" REF="246">
urged the circum&s;tance, in evidence of the
malignity and fal&s;hood of the accu&s;er.</P>
<P>&startq;Wilt, thou compel me to reveal my
proof?&endq; &s;aid the &s;tranger: &startq;Dare&s;t thou
to do &s;o?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why &s;hould I fear thee?&endq; an&s;wered
Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;k thy con&s;cienee!&endq; &s;aid the &s;tran|ger,
with a terrible frown.</P>
<P>The tribunal again &s;u&s;pended the exa|mination,
and con&s;ulted in private toge|ther.</P>
<P>To the la&s;t exhortation of the monk,
Schedoni was &s;ilent. Vivaldi ob&s;erved,
that during this &s;hort dialogue, the Con|fe&s;&s;or,
had never once turned his eyes to|ward's
the &s;tranger, but apparently avoid|ed
him, as an object too affecting to be
looked upon. He judged, from this cir|cum&s;tance,
and from &s;ome other appear|ances
in his conduct, that Schedoni was
guilty; yet the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt
alone did, not perfectly account, he
<PB N="246" REF="247">
thought, for the &s;trong emotion, with
which he avoided the &s;ight of his accu|&s;er
&mdash;unle&s;s, indeed, he knew that accu&s;er
to have been, not only an accomplice in
his crime, but the actual a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. In this
ca&s;e, it appeared natural even for the
&s;tern and &s;ubtle Schedoni to betray his
horror, on beholding the per&s;on of the
murderer, with the very in&s;trument of
crime in his gra&s;p. On the other hand,
Vivaldi could not but perceive it to be
highly improbable, that the very man
who had really committed the deed &s;hould
come voluntarily into a court of justice,
for the purpo&s;e of accusing his employer;
that he &s;hould dare publicly to accu&s;e
him, who&s;e guilt, however enormous,
was not more &s;o than his own.</P>
<P>The extraordinary manner, al&s;o, in
which the accu&s;er had proceeded in the
commencement of the affair, engaged Vi|valdi's
con&s;ideration; his apparent reluc|tance
<PB N="247" REF="248">
to be &s;een in this proce&s;s, and the
artful and my&s;terious plan, by which he
had cau&s;ed Schedoni to be &s;ummoned be|fore,
the, tribunal, and had endeavoured
that he &s;hould be there accu&s;ed by An|&s;aldo,
indicated, at lea&s;t to Vivaldi's, ap|prehen&s;ion,
the fearfulne&s;s of guilt, and,
&s;till more, that malice, and a thir&s;t of
vengeance, had in&s;tigated his conduct in
the pro&s;ecution. If the &s;tranger had been
actuated only by a love of ju&s;tice it ap|peared
that he would not have proceeded
toward it in a way thus dark and circui|tous,
but have &s;ought it by the u&s;ual pro|ce&s;s,
and have produced the proofs, which
he even now a&s;&s;erted he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of
Schedoni's crimes. In addition to the
circum&s;tances, which &s;eemed to &s;trengthen
a &s;uppo&s;ition of the guiltle&s;sne&s;s of Sche|doni,
was that of the accu&s;er's avoiding
to acknowledge who he was, and whence
he came. But Vivaldi pau&s;ed, again upon
this point; it appeared to be inexplicable,
<PB N="248" REF="249">
and he could not imagine why the accu&s;er
had adopted a &s;tyle of &s;ecrecy, which, if
he per&s;i&s;ted in it, mu&s;t probably defeat
the very purpo&s;e of the accu&s;ation; for
Vivaldi did not believe that the tribunal
would, condemn a pri&s;oner upon the te&s;|timony
of a per&s;on who, when called
upon, &s;hould publicly refu&s;e to reveal
him&s;elf, even to them. Yet the accu&s;er
mu&s;t certainly have con&s;idered this cir|cum&s;tance
before he ventured into court;
notwith&s;tanding which, he had appeared!</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections led Vivaldi to various
conjectures relative to the vi&s;it he had
him&s;elf received from the monk, the
dream that had preceded it, the extraor|dinary
means by which he had obtained
admittance to the pri&s;on, the declaration
of the centinels, that not any per&s;on had
pa&s;&s;ed the door, and many other unac|countable
particulars; and, while Vivaldi
now looked upon the wild phy&s;iognomy
of the &s;tranger, he almo&s;t fancied, as he
<PB N="249" REF="250">
had formerly done, that he beheld &s;ome|thing
hot of this earth.</P>
<P>&startq;I have heard of the &s;pirit of the
murdered,&endq; &s;aid he, to him&s;elf&mdash;&startq;re&s;t|le&s;s
for ju&s;tice, becoming, vi&s;ible in our
world&mdash;&endq; But Vivaldi checked the im|perfect
thought, and, though his imagi|nation
inclined him to the marvellous, and
to admit ideas which, filling and expand|ing
all the faculties of the &s;oul, produce
feelings that partake of the &s;ublime, he
now re&s;i&s;ted the propen&s;ity, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,
as ab&s;urd, a &s;uppo&s;ition, which had begun
to thrill his every nerve with horror. He
awaited, however; the re&s;ult of the exa|mination,
and what might be the further
conduct of the &s;tranger, with inten&s;e, ex|pectation.</P>
<P>When the tribunal had, at length,
finally determined an the method of their
proceedings, Schedoni was fir&s;t called
upon, and examined as to his knowledge
of the accu&s;er. It was the &s;ame inqui&s;i|tor
<PB N="250" REF="251">
who had formerly interrogated Vi|valdi,
that now &s;poke. &startq;You, father
Schedoni, a monk of the Spirito Santo
convent, at Naples, otherwi&s;e Ferando
Count di Bruno, an&s;wer to the que&s;tions
which &s;hall be put to you. Do you
know the name of this man who. now
appears as your accu&s;er?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I an&s;wer not to the title of Count
di Bruno,&endq; replied the Confe&s;&s;or, &startq;but I
will declare that I know this man. His
name is Nicola di Zampari.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;what is his condition?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He is a monk of the Dominican con|vent
of the Spirito Santo,&endq; replied Sche|doni.
&startq;Of his &s;amily I know little.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Where have you &s;een him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In the city of Naples, where he has
re&s;ided, during &s;ome years, beneath the
&s;ame roof with me, when I was of the
convent of San Angiolo, and &s;ince that
time, in the Spirito Santo.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have been a re&s;ident at the San
Angiolo?&endq; &s;aid the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="252">
&startq;I have,&endq; replied Schedoni; &startq;and it
was there that we fir&s;t lived together in
the confidence of friend&s;hip.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You now perceive how ill placed
was that confidence,&endq; &s;aid the inqui&s;itor,
&startq;and repent, no doubt, of your impru|dence?&endq;</P>
<P>The wary Schedoni was not entrapped
by this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t lament a di&s;covery of ingra|titude,&endq;
he replied, calmly, &startq;but the
&s;ubjects of my confidence were too pure
to give occa&s;ion for repentance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This Nicola di Zampari was ungrate|ful,
then? You had rendered, him &s;er|vices?&endq;
&s;aid the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>&startq;The cau&s;e of his enmity I can well
explain,&endq; ob&s;erved Schedoni, evading,
for the pre&s;ent, the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>&startq;Explain,&endq; &s;aid the &s;tranger, &s;olemnly.</P>
<P>Schedoni he&s;itated; &s;ome &s;udden con|&s;ideration
&s;eemed to occa&s;ion him per|plexity.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="253">
&startq;I call upon you, in the name of
your decea&s;ed brother,&endq; &s;aid the accu&s;er,
&startq;to reveal the cau&s;e of my enmity!&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, &s;truck by the tone in which
the &s;tranger &s;poke this, turned his eyes
upon him, but knew not how to interpret
the emotion vi&s;ible on his countenance.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor commanded Schedoni to
explain him&s;elf; the latter could not im|mediately
reply, but, when he recovered
a &s;elf-command, he added,</P>
<P>&startq;I promi&s;ed this accu&s;er, this Nicola
di Zampari, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his pre$erment, with
what little intere&s;t I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; it was but
little. Some &s;ucceeding circum&s;tances
encouraged me to believe that I could
more than fulfil my promi&s;e. His hopes
were elevated, and, in the fulne&s;s of ex|pectation
&mdash;he was di&s;appointed, for I was
my&s;elf deceived, by the per&s;on in whom
I had tru&s;ted. To the di&s;appointment of
a choleric man, I am to attribute this un|ju&s;t
accu&s;ation.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="254">
Schedoni pau&s;ed, and an air of di&s;&s;a|tisfaction
and anxiety appeared upon his
features. His accu&s;er remained &s;ilent,
but a malicious &s;mile announced his
triumph.</P>
<P>&startq;You mu&s;t declare, al&s;o, the &s;er|vices,&endq;
&s;aid the inqui&s;itor, &startq;which me|rited
the reward you promi&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tho&s;e &s;ervices were ine&s;timable to
me,&endq; re&s;umed Schedoni, after a momen|tary
he&s;itation; &startq;though they co&s;t di
Zampari little: they were the con&s;olations
of &s;ympathy, the intelligence of friend|&s;hip,
which he admini&s;tered, and which
gratitude told me never could be repaid.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Of &s;ympathy! of friend&s;hip!&endq; &s;aid
the grand-vicar. &startq;Are we to believe
that a man, who brings fal&s;e accu&s;ation of
&s;o dreadful a nature as the one now be|fore
us, is capable of be&s;towing the con|&s;olations
of &s;ympathy, and of friend&s;hip?.
You mu&s;t either acknowledge that &s;er|vices
of a le&s;s di&s;intere&s;ted nature won
<PB N="254" REF="255">
your promi&s;es of reward; or we mu&s;t
conclude that your aceu&s;er's charge is
ju&s;t. Your a&s;&s;ertions are incon&s;i&s;tent,
and your explanation too trivial, to de|ceive
for a moment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have declared the truth,&endq; &s;aid
Schedoni, haughtily.</P>
<P>&startq;In which in&s;tance?&endq; a&s;ked the in|qui&s;itor;
&startq;for your, a&s;&s;ertions contradict
each other!&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;ilent. Vivaldi could not
judge whether the pride which occa&s;ioned
his &s;ilence was that of innocence, or of
remor&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;It appears, from your own te&s;ti|mony,&endq;
&s;aid the inqui&s;itor, &startq;that the in|gratitude
was your's, not your accu&s;er's,
&s;ince he con&s;oled you with kindne&s;s,
which you have never returned him!&mdash;
Have you any thing further to &s;ay?&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>&startq;This, then, is your only explana|tion?&endq;
added the Inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="256">
Schedoni, bowed his head, The inqui|&s;itor
then, addre&s;&s;ing the aecu&s;er, de|manded
what he had to reply.</P>
<P>&startq;I have nothing to, reply,&endq; &s;aid the
&s;tranger, with malicious triumph; &startq;the
accu&s;ed has replied for me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We are to conclude, then, that he
has &s;poken truth, when he a&s;&s;erted you
to be a monk of the Spirito Santo, at Na|ples?&endq;
&s;aid the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>&startq;You, holy father&endq; &s;aid the &s;tranger,
gravely, appealing to the inqui&s;itor, &startq;can,
an&s;wer for me, whether I am.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi li&s;tened with emotion.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor ro&s;e from his chair, and
with &s;olemnity replied, &startq;I an&s;wer, then,
that you are not a monk of Naples.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By that reply,&endq; &s;aid the vicar-gene|ral,
in a low voice, to the inqui&s;itor, &startq;I
perceive you think father Schedoni is
guilty.&endq;</P>
<P>The rejoinder of the inqui&s;itor was de|livered
in &s;o low a tone, that Vivaldi
<PB N="256" REF="257">
could not under&s;tand it. He was per|plexed
to interpret the an&s;wer given to the
appeal of the &s;tranger. He thought that
the inqui&s;itor would not have ventured an
a&s;&s;ertion thus po&s;itive, if his opinion had
been drawn from inference only; and
that he &s;hould know the accu&s;er, while
he was conducting him&s;elf towards him
as a &s;tranger, amazed Vivaldi, no le&s;s
than if he had under&s;tood the character
of an inqui&s;itor to be as artle&s;s as his
own. On the other hand, he had &s;o
frequently &s;een the &s;tranger at Paluzzi,
and in the habit of a monk, that he
could hardly que&s;tion the a&s;&s;ertion of
Schedoni, as to his identity.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor, addre&s;&s;ing Schedoni,
&s;aid, &startq;Your evidence we know to be in
part erroneous; your accu&s;er is not a
monk of Naples, but a &s;ervant of the
mo&s;t holy Inqui&s;ition. Judging, from
this part of your evidence, we mu&s;t &s;u&s;|pect
the whole.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="258">
&startq;A &s;ervant of, the Inqui&s;ition!&endq; ex|claimed
Schedoni, with unaffected &s;ur|prize.
&startq;Reverend father! your a&s;&s;er|tion
a&s;toni&s;hes me! You are deceived,
however &s;trange it may appear, tru&s;t me,
you are deceived! You doubt the cre|dit
of my word; I, therefore, will a&s;&s;ert
no more. But inquire of Signor Vivaldi;
a&s;k him, whether he has not often, and
lately, &s;een my accu&s;er at Naples, and
in the habit of a monk.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have &s;een, him at the ruins, of Pa|luzzi,
near Naples, and in the eccle&s;ia&s;|tical
dre&s;s,&endq; replied. Vivaldi, without
waiting for the regular, que&s;tion, &startq;and
under circum&s;tances no le&s;s extraordinary
than tho&s;e which have attended him
here. But, in return for this frank ac|knowledgment,
I require of you, father
Schedoni, to an&s;wer &s;ome que&s;tions which
I &s;hall venture to &s;ugge&s;t to the tribunal&mdash;
By what means were you informed, that I
have often &s;een the &s;ranger at Paluzzi&mdash;
<PB N="258" REF="259">
and was you intere&s;ted or not in his
my&s;terious conduct towards me there?&endq;</P>
<P>To the&s;e que&s;tions, though formally
delivered from the tribunal, Schedoni
did not deign to reply.</P>
<P>&startq;It appears, then,&endq; &s;aid the vicar|general,
&startq;that the accu&s;er and the ac|cu&s;ed
were once accomplices.&endq;</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor objected, that this did
not certainly appear; and that, on the
contrary, Schedoni &s;eemed to have given
his la&s;t que&s;tions in de&s;pair; an ob&s;erva|tion
which Vivaldi thought extraordinary
from an inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>&startq;Be it <HI>accomplices,</HI> if it &s;o plea&s;e you,&endq;
&s;aid Schedoni, bowing to the grand vi|car,
without noticing the inqui&s;itor:
&startq;you may call us accomplices, but I
&s;ay, that we were <HI>friends.</HI> Since, it is
nece&s;&s;ary to my own peace, that I &s;hould
more fully explain &s;ome circum&s;tances
attending our intimacy, I will own that
my accu&s;er was occa&s;ionally my agent,
<PB N="259" REF="260">
and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pre&s;erving the dignity of an
illu&s;trious family at Naples, the family of
the Vivaldi. And there, holy father,&endq;
added Schedoni, pointing to Vincentio,
&startq;is the &s;on of that ancient hou&s;e, for
whom I have attempted &s;o much!&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi was almo&s;t overwhelmed by
this confe&s;&s;ion of Schedoni, though he
had already &s;u&s;pected a part of the truth.
In the &s;tranger he believed he &s;aw the
&s;landerer of Ellena, the ba&s;e in&s;trument
of the Marche&s;a's policy, and of Schedo|ni's
ambition; and the whole of his con|duct
at Paluzzi, at lea&s;t, &s;eemed now in|telligible.
In Schedoni he beheld his &s;e|cret
accu&s;er, and the inexorable enemy
whom he believed to have occa&s;ioned the
impri&s;onment of Ellena, At this latter
con&s;ideration, al$ circum&s;pection, all pru|dence
for&s;ook him: he declared, with
energy, that, from what Schedoni had
ju&s;t acknowledged to be his conduct, he
knew him for his &s;ecret accu&s;er, and the
<PB N="260" REF="261">
accu&s;er, al&s;o, of Ellena di Ro&s;alba; and
he called upon the tribunal to examine
into the Confe&s;&s;or's motives for the ac|cu&s;ation,
and afterwards to give hear|ing
to what be would him&s;elf unfold.</P>
<P>To this, the grand-vicar replied, that
Vivaldi's appeal would be taken into con|&s;ideration;
and he then ordered that the
pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould proceed.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor, addre&s;&s;ing Schedoni,
&s;aid, &startq;The di&s;intere&s;ted nature of your
friend&s;hip is now &s;ufficiently explained,
and the degree of credit, which is due to
your late a&s;&s;ertions under&s;tood. Of you
we a&s;k no more, but turn to father Nicola
di Zampari, and demand what he has to
&s;ay in &s;upport of his accu&s;ation. What
are your proofs, Nicola di Zampari, that
he who calls him&s;elf father Schedoni is
Ferando Count di Bruno; and that he
has been guilty of murder, the murder
of his brother, and of his wife? An&s;wer
to our charge!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="262">
&startq;To your fir&s;t que&s;tion,&endq; &s;aid the
monk, &startq;I reply that he has him&s;elf ac|knowledged
to me, on an occa&s;ion, which
it is not nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that he was
the Count di Bruno; to the la&s;t, I produce
the poniard which I received, with the
dying confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in whom he
employed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Still, the&s;e are not proofs, but a&s;&s;er|tions,&endq;
ob&s;erved the vicar-general, &startq;and
the fir&s;t forbids our confidence in the
&s;econd.&mdash;If, as you declare, Schedoni
him&s;elf acknowledged to you that he was
Count di Bruno, you mu&s;t have been to
him the intimate friend he has declared
you were, or he would not have confided
to you a &s;ecret &s;o dangerous to him&s;elf.
And, if you were that friend, what con|fidence,
ought we to give to your a&s;&s;ertions
re&s;pecting the dagger? &s;ince, whether
your accu&s;ations be true or fel&s;e, you
prove your&s;elf guilty of treachery in bring|ing
them forward at all.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">
Vivaldi was &s;urprized to hear &s;uch
candour from an inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>&startq;Here is my proof,&endq; &s;aid the &s;tranger,
who now produced a paper, containing
what he a&s;&s;erted to be the dying confe&s;&s;ion
of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. It was &s;igned by a prie&s;t
of Rome, as well as by him&s;elf, and ap|peared
from the date to have been given
only a very few weeks before. The prie&s;t,
he &s;aid, was living, and might be &s;um|moned.
The tribunal i&s;&s;ued an order for
the apprehen&s;ion of this prie&s;t, and that
he &s;hould be brought to give evidence on
the following evening; after which, the
bu&s;ine&s;s of this night proceeded, without
further interruption, towards its conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The vicar-general &s;poke again, &startq;Nicola
di Zampari, I call upon you to &s;ay, why,
if your proof of Schedoni's guilt is &s;o clear,
as the confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in him&s;elf
mu&s;t make it,&mdash;why you thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;ummon father An&s;aldo to atte&s;t
the criminality of the Count di Bruno?
The dying confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in is cer|tainly
<PB N="263" REF="264">
of more weight than any other
evidence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;ummoned the father An&s;aldo,&endq; re|plied
the &s;tranger, &startq;as a means of proving
that Schedoni is the Count di Bruno. The
confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;ufficiently proves
the Count to have been the in&s;tigator of
the murder, but not that Schedoni is the
Count.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But that is more than I will engage
to prove,&endq; replied An&s;aldo, &startq;I know it
was the Count di Bruno who confe&s;&s;ed to
me, but I do not know that the father
Schedoni, who is now before me, was the
per&s;on who &s;o confe&s;&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Con&s;cientiou&s;ly ob&s;erved!&endq; &s;aid the
vicar-general, interrupting the &s;tranger,
who was about to reply, &startq;but you, Nicola
di Zampari, have not on this head been
&s;ufficiently explicit.&mdash;How do you know
that Schedoni is the penitent who confe&s;&s;ed
to An&s;aldb on the vigil of San Marco?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Reverend father, that is the point I
Was about to explain,&endq; replied the monk,
<PB N="264" REF="265">
&startq;I my&s;elf accompanied Schedoni, on
the eve of San Marco, to the church
of the <HI>Santa Maria del Pianto,</HI> at the
very hour when the confe&s;&s;ion is &s;aid to
have been made. Schedoni fold me he
was going to confe&s;&s;ion; and, when I
ob&s;erved to him his unu&s;ual agitation, his
behaviour implied a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of ex|traordinary
guilt; he even betrayed it by
&s;ome words, which he dropt in the con|fu&s;ion
of his mind. I parted with him at
the gates of the church. He was then of
an order of white friars, and habited as
father An&s;aldo has de&s;cribed. Within a
few weeks after this confe&s;&s;ion, he left his
convent, for what rea&s;on I never could
learn, though I have often &s;urmi&s;ed it,
and came to re&s;ide at the Spirito Santo,
whither I al&s;o had removed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Here is no proof,&endq;&s;aid the vicar|general,
&startq;other friars of that order might
confe&s;s at the &s;ame hour, in the &s;ame
church.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="266">
&startq;But here is &s;trong pre&s;umption for
proof,&endq; ob&s;erved the inqui&s;itor, &startq;Holy
father, we mu&s;t judge from probabilities,
as well as from proof.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But probabilities them&s;elves,&endq; replied
the vicar-general, &startq;are &s;trongly again&s;t
the evidence of a man, who would betray
another by means of words dropped in the
unguarded moments of powerful emotion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are the&s;e the &s;entiments of an inqui|&s;itor!&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi to him&s;elf, &startq;can &s;uch
glorious candour appear amid&s;t the tribu|nal
of an Inqui&s;ition!&endq; Tears sell fa&s;t
on Vivaldi's cheek while lie gazed upon
this ju&s;t judge, who&s;e candour, had it
been exerted in his cau&s;e, could not have
excited more powerful &s;en&s;ations of e&s;teem
and admiration. &startq;An inqui&s;itor!&endq; he
repeated to him&s;elf, &startq;an inqui&s;itor!&endq;</P>
<P>The inferior inqui&s;itor, however, was
&s;o far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any congeniality of
character with his &s;uperior, that he was
evidently di&s;appointed by the appearance
<PB N="266" REF="267">
of liberality, which the vicar-general di&s;|covered,
and immediately &s;aid, &startq;Has the
accu&s;er any thing further to urge in evi|dence,
that the father, Schedoni is the
penitent, who confe&s;&s;ed to the penitentiary
An&s;aldo?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have,&endq; replied the monk, with a&s;|perity.
&startq;When I had le&s;t Schedoni in
the church, I lingered without the walls
for his return, according to appointment.
But he appeared con&s;iderably &s;ooner than
I expected, and in a &s;tate of di&s;order, &s;uch
as I had never, witne&s;&s;ed in him before.
In an in&s;tant he pa&s;&s;ed me, nor could my
voice arre&s;t his progre&s;s. Confu&s;ion &s;eem|ed
to reign within the church and the
convent, and, when I would have enter|ed,
for the purpo&s;e of inquiring the occa|&s;ion
of it, the gates were &s;uddenly clo&s;ed,
and all entrance forbidden. It has &s;ince
appeared, that the monks were then
&s;earching for, the penitent. A rumour
afterwards reached me, that a confe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="267" REF="268">
had cau&s;ed this disturbance; that the
father-confe&s;&s;or, who happened at that
time to be the grand penitentiary An&s;aldo,
had left the chair in horror of what had been
divulged from the grate, and had judged
it nece&s;&s;ary that a &s;earch &s;hould be made
for the penitent, who was a white, friar.
This report, reverend fathers, excited
general attention; with me it did more&mdash;
for I thought I knew the penitent. When
on the following day, I que&s;tioned Sche|doni
as to his &s;udden departure from the
church of the Black Penitents, his an&s;wers
were dark, but emphatic, and he extorted
from me a promi&s;e, thoughtle&s;s that I was!
never to di&s;clo&s;e his vi&s;it of the preceding
evening to the <HI>Santa del Pianto.</HI> I then
certainly di&s;covered who was the penitent!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Did he, then, confe&s;s to you also?&endq;
&s;aid the Vicar-general.</P>
<P>&startq;No father. I under&s;tood him to
be the penitent to whom the report
alluded, but I had no &s;u&s;picion of the
nature of his crimes, till the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in
<PB N="268" REF="269">
began his confe&s;&s;ion, the conclu&s;ion of
which clearly explained the &s;ubject of
Schedoni's; it explained al&s;o his motive
for endeavouring ever after to attach me
to his intere&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have now&endq; &s;aid the vicar-general,
&startq;you have now, confe&s;&s;ed your&s;elf a
member of the convent of the Spirito
Santo at Naples, and an intimate of the
father Schedoni; one whom for many
years he has endeavoured to attach to him.
Not an hour has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince you denied
all this; the negative to the latter circum|&s;tance
was given, it is true, by implication
only; but to the fir&s;t a direct and ab&s;olute
denial was pronounced!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I denied that I <HI>am</HI> a monk of Naples,&endq;
replied the accu&s;er, &startq;and I appealed to
the Inqui&s;itor for the truth of my denial.
He has &s;aid, that I am now a &s;ervant of the
mo&s;t holy Inqui&s;ition.&endq;</P>
<P>The Vicar-general, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e,
looked at the inqui&s;itor for explanation;
<PB N="269" REF="270">
other members of the tribunal did the
&s;ame; the re&s;t appeared to under&s;tand
more than they had thought it nece&s;&s;ary to
avow. The inqui&s;itor, who had been
called upon, ro&s;e, and replied,</P>
<P>&startq;Nicola di Zampari has &s;poken the
truth. It is not many weeks &s;ince he en|tered
the holy office. A certificate from
his convent at Naples bears te&s;timony to
the truth of what I advance, and procured
him admittance here.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is extraordinary that you &s;hould
not have di&s;clo&s;ed your knowledge of this
per&s;on before!&endq; &s;aid the vicar|general.</P>
<P>&startq;Holy father, I had rea&s;ons,&endq; replied
the inqui&s;itor, &startq;you will recollect that
the accu&s;ed, was pre&s;ent, and you will un|der&s;tand
them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I comprehend you,&endq; &s;aid the Vicar|general,
&startq;but I do neither approve of,
nor perceive any nece&s;&s;ity for your coun|tenancing
the &s;ubterfuge of this Nicola di
Zampari, relative to his identity. But
more of this in private.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="271">
&startq;I will explain alt there,&endq; an&s;wered
the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>&startq;It appears then,&endq; re&s;umed the vicar-general,
&s;peaking aloud, &startq;that this Nicola
di Zampari was formerly the friend and
confidant of father Schedoni, whom he
now accu&s;es. The accu&s;ation is evidently
malicious; whether it be al&s;o fal&s;e, re|mains
to be decided. A material que&s;tion
naturally ari&s;es out of the &s;ubject&mdash;Why
was not the accu&s;ation brought forward
before this period?&endq;</P>
<P>The monk's vi&s;age brightened with the
&s;atisfaction of anticipated triumph, and he
immediately replied,</P>
<P>&startq;Mo&s;t holy father! as &s;oon as I a&s;cer|tained
the crime, I prepared to pro&s;ecute
the perpetrator of it. A &s;hort period only
has elap&s;ed &s;ince the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in gave his con|fe&s;&s;ion.
In this interval I di&s;covered, in
the&s;e pri&s;ons, Signor Vivaldi, and imme|diately
comprehended by who&s;e means he
was confined. I knew enough both of
<PB N="271" REF="272">
the accu&s;er and accu&s;ed, to under&s;tand
which of the&s;e was innocent, and had
then a double motive for cau&s;ing, Schedoni
to be &s;ummoned;&mdash;I wi&s;hed equally to
deliver the innocent and puni&s;h, the cri|minal.
The que&s;tion as to the motive for
my becoming the enemy of him, who was
once my friend, is already an&s;wered;&mdash;
it was a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, not a &s;ugge&s;tion
of malice.&endq;</P>
<P>The grand-vicar &s;miled, but a&s;ked no fur|ther;
and this long examination concluded
with committing Schedoni again into clo&s;e
cu&s;tody, till full evidence &s;hould be obtained
of his guilt, or his innocence &s;hould appear.
Re&s;pecting the manner of his wife's
death, there was&endq; yet no other evidence
than that which was a&s;&s;erted to be his own
confe&s;&s;ion, which, though perhaps &s;uffi|cient
to condemn a criminal before the tri|bunal
of the Inqui&s;ition, was not enough to
&s;atisfy the pre&s;ent vicar-general, who gave
direction that means might be employed to|wards
<PB N="272" REF="273">
obtaining proof of each article
of the accu&s;ation; in order that, &s;hould
Schedoni be acquitted of the charge of
having murdered his brother, documents
might appear for pro&s;ecuting him re&s;pect|ing
the death of his wife.</P>
<P>Schedoni, when he withdrew from the
hall, bowed re&s;pectfully to the tribunal,
and whether, not with &s;tanding late appear|ances,
he were innocent, or that &s;ubtlety
enabled him to rea&s;&s;ume his u&s;ual addre&s;s,
it is certain his manner no longer betrayed
any &s;ymptom of con&s;cious guilt. His
countenance was firm and even tranquil,
and his air dignified. Vivaldi, who,
during the greater part of this examina|tion,
had been convinced of his crimina|lity,
now only doubted his innocence.
Vivaldi was him&s;elf reconducted to his prison,
and the &s;itting of the tribunal was
di&s;&s;olved.</P>

<P>WHEN the night of Schedoni's trial
arrived, Vivaldi was again &s;ummoned to the
hall of the tribunal. Every circum&s;tance
was now arranged according to the full cere|monies
of the place; the members of the
tribunal were more numerous than for|merly
at the examinations; the chief in|qui&s;itors
wore habits of a fa&s;hion different
from tho&s;e which&punc; before di&s;tingui&s;hed
them, and their turbans, of a &s;ingular
form and larger &s;ize, &s;eemed to give an
air of sterner ferocity to their features.
The hall, as u&s;ual, was hung with black,
And every per&s;on who appeared there,
<PB N="274" REF="275">
whether inqui&s;itor, official, witne&s;s or
pri&s;oner, was habited in the &s;ame di&s;mal
hue, which, together with the kind of
light diffu&s;ed through the chamber from
lamps hung high in the vaulted roof, and
from torches held by parties of officials
who kept watch at the &s;everal doors, and
in different parts of this immen&s;e hall,
gave a character of gloomy &s;olemnity to
the a&s;&s;embly, which was almo&s;t horrific.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;ituated in a place, whence
he beheld the whole of the tribunal, and
could di&s;tingui&s;h whatever was: pa&s;&s;ing in
the hall. The countenance of every
member was now fully di&s;played to him
by the torchmen, who, arranged at the
&s;teps of the platform on which the three
ehief inqui&s;itors were elevated, extended
in a &s;emicircle on either hand of the place
occupied by the inferior members. The
red glare, which the torches threw upon
the latter, certainly did not &s;often the ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of faces, for the mo&s;t part &s;culp|tured
<PB N="275" REF="276">
by pa&s;&s;ions of dark malignity or
fiercer cruelty; and Vivaldi could not bear
even to examine them long.</P>
<P>Before the bar of the tribuna1, he di&s;|tingui&s;hed
Schedoni, and little did he
&s;u&s;pect, that in him, a criminal brought
thither to an&s;wer for the guilt of murder&mdash;
the murder of a brother, and of a wife he
beheld the parent of Ellena di Ro&s;alba!</P>
<P>Near Schedoni was &s;eated the peniten|tiary
An&s;aldo; the Roman prie&s;t, who was
to be a principal witne&s;s, and father Nicola
di Zampari, upon whom Vivaldi could
not even, now look without experiencing
&s;omewhat of the awe, which had prevail|ed
over his mind when he was inclined to
con&s;ider the &s;tranger rather as the vi&s;ion
of another world, than as a being of this.
The &s;ame wild and inde&s;cribable character.
&s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed his air, his every look
and movement, and Vivaldi could not
but believe that &s;omething in the highe&s;t
degree, extraordinary would yet be di&s;co|vered
concerning him.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="277">
The witne&s;&s;es being called over, Vivaldi
under&s;tood that he was placed among
them, though he had only repeated the
words which father Nicola had &s;poken, and
which, &s;ince Nicola him&s;elf was pre&s;ent as
a witne&s;s again&s;t Schedoni, he did not
perceive could be in the lea&s;t material
on the trial.</P>
<P>When Vivaldi had, in his turn, an&s;wer|ed
to his name, a voice, bur&s;ting forth
from a di&s;tant part of the hall, exclaimed,
&startq;It is my ma&s;ter! my <HI>dear</HI> mai&s;er!&endq; and
on directing his eyes whence it. came, he
perceived the faithful Paulo &s;truggling
with his guard. Vivaldi called to him to
be patient, and to forbear re&s;i&s;tance, an
exhortation, however, which &s;erved only
to increa&s;e the efforts of the &s;ervant for
liberty, and in the next in&s;tant he broke
from the gra&s;p of the officials, and, dart|ing
towards Vivaldi, fell at his feet, &s;ob|bing,
and cla&s;ping his knees, and exclaim|ing,
&startq;O my ma&s;ter! my ma&s;ter! have
I found you at la&s;t?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="278">
Vivaldi, as much affected by this meet|ing
as Paulo, could not immediately &s;peak.
He would, however, have rai&s;ed and em|braced
his affectionate &s;ervant, but Paulo,
&s;till clinging to his knees and &s;obbing,
was &s;o much agitated that he &s;carcely un|der&s;tood
any thing &s;aid to him, and to the
kind a&s;&s;urances and gentle remon&s;trances
of Vivaldi, con&s;tantly replied as if to the
officers, whom he fancied to be forcing
him away.</P>
<P>&startq;Remember your &s;ituation, Paulo,&endq; &s;aid
Vivaldi, &startq;con&s;ider mine al&s;o, and be
governed by prudence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;hall not force me hence!&endq; cried
Paulo, &startq;you can take my life only once;
if I mu&s;t die, it &s;hall be here.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Recollect your&s;elf, Paulo, and be
compo&s;ed. Your life, I tru&s;t is in no
danger.&endq;</P>
<P>Paulo looked up; and again bur&s;ting
into, a pa&s;&s;ion of tears, repeated, &startq;O! my
ma&s;ter! my ma&s;ter! Where have you been
<PB N="278" REF="279">
all this while? are you indeed alive? I
thought I never &s;hould &s;ee you again! I
have dreamt an hundred times that you
were dead and buried! and I wi&s;hed to
be dead and buried with you. I thought
you was gone out of this world into the
next. I feared you was gone to heaven,
and &s;o believed we &s;hould, never meet
again. But now, I &s;ee you once more,
and know that you live! O! my ma&s;ter!
my ma&s;ter!&endq;</P>
<P>The officers who had followed Paulo,
now endeavouring to withdraw him, he
became more outrageous.</P>
<P>&startq;Do your wor&s;t at once,&endq; &s;aid he;
&startq;but you &s;hall find tough work of it, if
you try to force me from hence, &s;o you
had better, be contented with killing me
here.&endq;</P>
<P>The incen&s;ed officials were laying vio|lent
hands upon him, when Vivaldi inter|po&s;ed.
&startq;I entreat, I &s;upplicate you,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;that you will &s;uffer him to re|main
near me.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="280">
&startq;It is impo&s;&s;ible,&endq; replied an officer,
&startq;we dare not.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will promi&s;e that he &s;hall not even
&s;peak to me, if you will only allow him to
be near,&endq; added Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Not &s;peak to you, ma&s;ter!&endq; exclaim|ed
Paulo, &startq;but I will &s;tay by you, and
&s;peak to you as long as I like, till my la&s;t
ga&s;p. Let them do their wor&s;t at once; I
defy them all, and all the. devils of in|qui&s;itors
at their heels. too, to force me
away. I can die but once, and they
ought to be &s;atisfied with that,&mdash;&s;o what
is there to be afraid of? Not &s;peak!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He knows not what he &s;ays,&endq; &s;aid
Vivaldi to the officials, while he endea|voured
to &s;ilence Paulo with his hand,
&startq;I am certain that he will &s;ubmit to
whatever I &s;hall require of him, and will
be entirely &s;ilent; or, if he does &s;peak
now and then, it &s;hall be only in a
whi&s;per.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A whi&s;per!&endq; &s;aid an officer &s;neering|ly,
&startq;do you &s;uppo&s;e Signor, that any
<PB N="280" REF="281">
per&s;on is &s;uffered to &s;peak in a whi&s;per
here?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A whi&s;per!&endq; &s;houted Paulo, &startq;I &s;corn
to &s;peak in a whi&s;per. I will &s;peak &s;o
loud, that every word I &s;ay &s;hall ring in
the ears of all tho&s;e old black devils on
the benches yonder; aye, and tho&s;e on
that mountebank &s;tage too, that &s;it there
looking &s;o grim and angry as if they long|ed
to tear us in pieces. They&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Silence,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi with empha&s;is,
&startq;Paulo, I command you to be &s;ilent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They &s;hall know a bit of my mind,&endq;
continued Paulo, without noticing Vivaldi,
&startq;I will tell them what they have to ex|pect
for all their cruel u&s;age of my poor
ma&s;ter. Where do; they expect to go
when they die, I wonder? Though, for
that matter, they cannot go to a wor&s;e
place than they are in already, and I
&s;uppo&s;e it is, knowing that, which makes
them not afraid of being ever &s;o wicked:
They &s;hall hear a little plain truth, for
<PB N="281" REF="282">
once in their lives, however, they &s;hall
hear&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>During the whole of this harangue,
Vivaldi, alarmed for the con&s;equence of
&s;uch imprudent, though hone&s;t indigna|tion,
had been u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible effort to
&s;ilence him, and was the more alarmed,
&s;ince the officials made no further attempt
to interrupt Paulo, a forbearance, which
Vivaldi attributed to malignity, and to a
wi&s;h that Paulo might be entrapped by
his own act. At length he made him&s;elf
heard.</P>
<P>&startq;I <HI>entreat,</HI>&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>Paulo &s;topped for a moment.</P>
<P>&startq;Paulo!&endq; rejoined Vivaldi earne&s;tly,
&startq;do you love your ma&s;ter?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Love my ma&s;ter!&endq; &s;aid Paulo re|&s;entfully,
without allowing Vivaldi to
fini&s;h his &s;entence, &startq;Have I not gone
through fire and water, for him? or, what
is as good, have I not put my&s;elf into the
Inqui&s;ition, and all on his account? and
<PB N="282" REF="283">
now to be a&s;ked, &startq;Do I love my ma&s;ter!&endq;
If you believe, Signor, that any thing el&s;e
made me come here, into the&s;e di&s;mal
holes, you are quite entirely out; and
when they have made an end of me, as I
&s;uppo&s;e they will do, before all is over,
you will, perhaps, think better of me than
to &s;u&s;pect that I came here for my own
plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All that may be as you &s;ay, Paulo,&endq;
replied Vivaldi coldly, while he with dif|ficulty
commanded his tears, &startq;but your
immediate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is the only con|duct
that can convince me of the &s;incerity
of your profe&s;&s;ions. I <HI>entreat</HI> you to be
&s;ilent.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>&startq;Entreat</HI> me!&endq; &s;aid Paulo, &startq;O my
ma&s;ter! what have I done that it &s;hould
come to this? <HI>Entreat</HI> me!&endq; he repeated,
&s;obbing.</P>
<P>&startq;You will then give me this proof of
your attachment?&endq; a&s;ked Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Do not u&s;e &s;uch a heart breaking
word again, ma&s;ter,&endq; replied Paulo, while
<PB N="283" REF="284">
he da&s;hed the tears from his cheek, &startq;&s;uch
a heart breaking word, and I will do any
thing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;ubmit to what I require then,
Paulo?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, Signor, if&mdash;if it is even to kneel
at the feet of that devil of an inqui&s;itor,
yonder.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall only require you to be &s;ilent,&endq;
replied Vivaldi, &startq;and you may then be
permitted to remain near me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Signor, well; I will do as
you bid me, then, and only ju&s;t &s;ay&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Not a &s;yllable! Paulo,&endq; interrupted
Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Only ju&s;t &s;ay, ma&s;ter&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Not a word I entreat you!&endq; added
Vivaldi, &startq;or you will be removed imme|diately.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;His removal does not depend on that,&endq;
&s;aid one of the officials, breaking from his
watchful &s;ilence, &startq;he mu&s;t go, and that
without more delay.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="285">
&startq;What! after I have promi&s;ed not to
open my lips!&endq; &s;aid Paulo, &startq;do you pre|tend
to break your agreement?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There <HI>is</HI> no pre&s;ence, and there <HI>was</HI>
no agreement,&endq; replied the man &s;harply,
&startq;&s;o obey directly, or it will be the wor&s;e
for you.&endq;</P>
<P>The officials were provoked, and Paulo
became &s;till more enraged and clamorous,
till at length the uproar reached the
tribunal at the other end of the hall, and
&s;ilence having been commanded, an in|quiry
was made into the cau&s;e of the con|fu&s;ion.
The con&s;equence of this was, an
order that Paulo &s;hould withdraw from
Vivaldi; but as at this moment he feared
no greater evil, he gave his refu&s;al to the
tribunal with as little ceremony as he had
done before to the officials.</P>
<P>At length, after much difficulty, a &s;ort
of compromi&s;e was made, and Paulo being
&s;oothed by his ma&s;ter into &s;ome degree of
compliance, was &s;uffered to remain with|in
a &s;hort di&s;tance of him.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="286">
The bu&s;ine&s;s of the trial &s;oon after
commenced. An&s;aldo the penitentiary,
and father Nicola, appeared as witne&s;&s;es,
as did, al&s;o, the Roman prie&s;t, who had
a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in taking the depo&s;itions of the
dying a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, He had been privately
interrogated, and had given clear and &s;a|tisfactory
evidence as to the truth of the
paper, produced by Nicola. Other wit|ne&s;&s;es,
al&s;o had been subpoenaed, whom
Schedoni had no expectation of meet|ing.</P>
<P>The deportment of the Confe&s;&s;or, on
fir&s;t entering the hall, was collected and
firm; it remained unchanged when the
Roman prie&s;t was brought forward; but,
on the appearance of another witne&s;s,
his courage &s;eemed to faulter. Before this
evidence was, however, called for, the
depo&s;itions of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in were publicly
read. They &s;tated, with the clo&s;e&s;t con|ci&s;ene&s;s,
the chief facts, of which the
following is a &s;omewhat more, dilated
narrative.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="287">
It appeared, that about the year 1742,
the late Count di Bruno had pa&s;&s;ed over
into Greece, a journey which his brother,
the pre&s;ent Confe&s;&s;or, having long ex|pected,
had meditated to take advantage
of. Though a lawle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion had fir&s;t
&s;ugge&s;ted to the dark mind of Schedoni
the atrocious act, which &s;hould de&s;troy a
brother, many circum&s;tances and con&s;ide|rations
had con&s;pired to urge him towards
its accompli&s;hment. Among the&s;e was the
conduct of the late Count towards him|&s;elf,
which, however rea&s;onable, as it
had contradicted his own &s;elfi&s;h gratifica|tions,
and added &s;trong reproof to op|po&s;ition,
had excited his mo&s;t inveterate
hatred. Schedoni, who, as a younger
brother of his family, bore, at that time,
the title of Count di Marinella, had di&s;|&s;ipated
his &s;mall patrimony at a very early
age; but, though &s;uffering might then
have taught him prudence, it had only
encouraged him in duplicity, and ren|dered
<PB N="287" REF="288">
him more eager to &s;eek a temporary
refuge in the &s;ame habits of extravagance
which had led to it. The Count di Bru|no,
though his fortune was very limited,
had afforded frequent &s;upplies to his bro|ther;
till, finding that he was incorrigi|ble,
and that the &s;ums which he him&s;elf
&s;pared with difficulty from his family were
lavi&s;hed, without remor&s;e, by Marinella,
in&s;tead of being applied, with economy,
to his &s;upport, he refu&s;ed further aid than
was &s;ufficient for his ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;i|ties.</P>
<P>It would be difficult for a candid mind
to believe how a conduct &s;o rea&s;onable
could po&s;&s;ibly excite hatred in any brea&s;t,
or that the power of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s could &s;o
far warp any unde&s;anding, as to induce
Marinella, whom we will, in future,
again call Schedoni, to look upon his
brother with dete&s;tation, becau&s;e he had
refu&s;ed to ruin him&s;elf that his kin&s;man
might revel! Yet it is certain that Sche|doni,
<PB N="288" REF="289">
terming the nece&s;&s;ary prudence of
di Bruno to be meanne&s;s and cold in&s;en&s;i|bility
to the comfort of others, &s;uffered
full as much re&s;entment towards him from
&s;y&s;tem, as he did from pa&s;&s;ion, though
the meanne&s;s and the in&s;en&s;ibility he ima|gined
in his brother's character were not
only real traits in his own, but were di&s;|playing
them&s;elves in the very arguments
he urged again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The rancour thus excited was cheri&s;hed
by innumerable circum&s;tances, and ri|pened
by envy, that meane&s;t and mo&s;t
malignant of the human pa&s;&s;ions; by
envy of di Bruno's ble&s;&s;ings, of an un|encumbered
e&s;tate, and of a beautiful
wife, he was tempted to perpetrate the
deed, which might transfer tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings
to him&s;elf. Spalatro, whom he employed
to this purpo&s;e, was well known to him,
and he did not fear to confide the conduct
of the crime to this man, who was to
purcha&s;e a little habitation on the remote
<PB N="289" REF="290">
&s;hore of the Adriatic, and, with a certain
&s;tipend, to re&s;ide there. The ruinous
dwelling, to which Ellena had been car|ried,
as its &s;olitary &s;ituation &s;uited Sche|doni's
views, was taken for him.</P>
<P>Schedoni, who had good intelligence
of all di Bruno's movements, acquainted
Spalatro, from time to time, with his ex|act
&s;ituation; and it was after di Bruno,
on his return, had cro&s;&s;ed the Adriatic,
from Ragu&s;i to Manfredonia, and was
entering upon the woods of the Garga|nus,
that Spalatro, with his comrade,
overtook him. They fired at the Count
and his attendants, who were only a
valet, and a guide of the country; and,
concealed among the thickets, they &s;e|curely
repeated the attack. The &s;hot did
not immediately &s;ucceed, and the Count,
looking round to di&s;cover his enemy, pre|pared
to defend him&s;elf, but the firing was
&s;o rapidly &s;u&s;tained, that, at length, both
di Bruno and his &s;ervant fell, covered
with wounds. The guide fled.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="291">
The unfortunate travellers were buried
by their a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins on the &s;pot; but, whe|ther
the &s;u&s;picion which attends upon the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, prompted Spala|tro
to guard again&s;t every po&s;&s;ibility of
being betrayed by the accomplice of his
crime, or whatever was the motive, he
returned to the fore&s;t alone; and, &s;hroud|ed
by night, removed the bodies to a pit,
which he had prepared under the flooring
of the hou&s;e where he lived; thus di&s;|placing
all proof, &s;hould his accomplice
hereafter point out to ju&s;tice the &s;pot in
which he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to depo&s;it the man|gled
remains of di Bruno.</P>
<P>Schedoni contrived a plau&s;ible hi&s;tory
of the &s;hipwreck of his brother upon the
Adriatic, and of the lo&s;s of the whole
crew; and, as no per&s;ons but the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins
were acquainted with the real cau&s;e
of his death, the guide, who had fled,
and the people at the only town he had
pa&s;&s;ed through, &s;ince he landed, being ig|norant
<PB N="291" REF="292">
even of the name of di Bruno,
there was not any circum&s;tance to contra|dict
the fal&s;hood. It was univer&s;ally cre|dited,
and even the widow of the Count
had, perhaps, never doubted its truth;
or if, after her compelled marriage with
Schedoni, his conduct did awaken a &s;u&s;|picion,
it was too vague to produce any
&s;erious con&s;equence.</P>
<P>During the reading of Spalatro's con|fe&s;&s;ion,
and particularly at the conclu&s;ion
of it, the &s;urprize and di&s;may of Sche|doni
were too powerful for concealment;
and it was not the lea&s;t con&s;iderable part
of his wonder, that Spalatro &s;hould have
come to Rome for the purpo&s;e of making
the&s;e depo&s;itions; but further con&s;idera|tion
gave him a conjecture of the truth.</P>
<P>The account, which Spalatro had given
of his motive for this journey to the prie&s;t,
was, that, having lately under&s;tood Sche|doni
to be re&s;ident at Rome, he had fol|lowed
him thither, with an intention of
<PB N="292" REF="293">
relieving his con&s;cience by an acknow|lodgment
of his own crimes, and a di&s;|clo&s;ure
of Schedoni's. This, however,
was not exactly the fact. The de&s;ign of
Spalatro was to extort money from the
guilty Confe&s;&s;or; a de&s;ign, from, which
the latter believed he had protected him|&s;elf,
as well as from every other evil con|&s;equence,
when he mi&s;led his late ac|complice,
re&s;pecting his place of re&s;i|dence;
little fore&s;eeing that the very arti|fice,
which &s;hould &s;end this man in &s;earch
of him to Rome, in&s;tead of Naples,
would be the means of bringing his crimes
before the public.</P>
<P>Spalatro had followed the &s;teps of Sche|doni
as far as the town at which, he &s;lept,
on the fir&s;t night of his journey; and,
having there pa&s;&s;ed him, had reached the
villa di Cambru&s;ca, when, perceiving the
Confe&s;&s;or approaching, he had taken
&s;helter from ob&s;ervation, within the ruin.
The motive, which before made him
<PB N="293" REF="294">
&s;hrink from notice, had contributed, and
&s;till did &s;o, to a &s;u&s;picion that he aimed at
the life of Schedoni, who, in wounding
him, believed he had &s;aved him&s;elf from
an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. The wounds, however, of
Spalatro did not &s;o much di&s;able him,
but that he proceeded towards Rome from
the town whence the parting road had
conducted his ma&s;ter towards Naples.</P>
<P>The fatigue of a long journey, per|formed
chiefly on foot, in Spalatro's
wounded condition, occa&s;ioned a fever,
that terminated together his journey and
his life; and in his la&s;t hours he had un|burdened
his con&s;cience by a $ull confe&s;|&s;ion
of his guilt. The prie&s;t, who, on
this occa&s;ion, had. been $ent for, alarmed
by the importance of the confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ince
it implicated a living per&s;on, called in a
friend as witne&s;s to the depo&s;itions. This
witne&s;s was father Nicola, the former in|timate
of Schedoni, and who was of a
character to rejoice in any di&s;covery, which
<PB N="294" REF="295">
might puni&s;h a man from who&s;e repeated
promi&s;es he had received only &s;evere di&s;|appointments.</P>
<P>Schedoni now perceived that all his de|&s;igns
again&s;t Spalatro had failed, and he
had meditated more than have yet been
fully di&s;clo&s;ed. It may be remembered,
that on parting with the pea&s;ant, his con|ductor,
the Confe&s;&s;or, gave him a &s;tiletto
to defend him, as he &s;aid, from the at|tack
of Spalatro, in ca&s;e of encountering
him on the road. The point of this in|&s;trument
was tipped with poi&s;on; &s;o
that a &s;cratch from it was &s;ufficient to in|flict
death. Schedoni had for many years
&s;ecretly carried about him &s;uch an enve|nomed
in&s;irument, for rea&s;ons known
only to him&s;elf. He had hoped, that,
&s;hould the pea&s;ant meet Spalatro, and be
provoked to defend him&s;elf, this &s;tiletto
would terminate the life of his accom|plice,
and relieve him from all probabi|lity
of di&s;covery, &s;ince the other a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in,
<PB N="295" REF="296">
whom he employed, had been dead &s;eve|ral
years. The expedient failed in every
re&s;pect; the pea&s;ant did not even &s;ee
Spalatro; and, before he reached his
home, he luckily lo&s;t the fatal &s;tiletto,
which, as he had di&s;covered him&s;elf to be
acquainted with &s;ome circum&s;tances con|nected
with the crimes of Schedoni, the
Confe&s;&s;or would have wi&s;hed him to keep,
from the chance, that he might &s;ome time
injure him&s;elf in u&s;&s;ing it. The poniard, as
he had no proper means of fa&s;tening it to
his dre&s;s, had fallen, and was carried
away by the torrent he was cro&s;&s;ing at
that moment.</P>
<P>But, if Schedoni had been &s;hocked by
the confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, his di&s;may
was con&s;iderably greater, when a new
witne&s;s was brought forward, and he per|ceived
an ancient dome&s;tic of his hou&s;e.
This man identified Schedoni for Ferando
Count di Bruno, with whom he had lived
as a &s;ervant after the death of the Count
his brother. And not only did he bear
<PB N="296" REF="297">
te&s;timony to the per&s;on of Schedoni, but
to the death of the Counte&s;s, his wife.
Giovanni declared him&s;elf to be one of
the dome&s;tics who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in convey|ing
her to her apartment, after &s;he had
been &s;truck by the poniard of Schedoni,
and who had afterwards attended her fu|neral
in the church of the Santa del Mi|racoli,
a convent near the late re&s;idence
of di Bruno. He further affirmed, that
the phy&s;icians had reported her death to
be in con&s;equence of the wound &s;he had
received, and he bore witne&s;s to the flight
of his ma&s;ter, previous to the death of
the Counte&s;s, and immediately upon the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and that he had never pub|licly
appeared upon his e&s;tate fince that
period.</P>
<P>An inqui&s;itor a&s;ked, whether any
mea&s;ures had been taken by the relations
of the decea&s;ed lady, toward a pro&s;ecu|tion
of the Count.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s replied, that a long &s;earch
had been made for the Count, for &s;uch a
<PB N="297" REF="298">
purpo&s;e, but that he had wholly eluded
di&s;covery, and that, of cour&s;e, no further
&s;tep had been taken in the affair. This
reply appeared to occa&s;ion di&s;&s;atisfaction;
the tribunal was &s;ilent, and &s;eemed to he|&s;itate;
the vicar-general then addre&s;&s;ed
the witne&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;How can you be certain that the per|&s;on
now before you, calling him&s;elf fa|ther
Schedoni, is the Count di Bruno,
your former ma&s;ter, if you have never
&s;een him during the, long interval of
years you mention?&endq;</P>
<P>Giovanni; without, he&s;itation, an&s;wer|ed,
that, though years had worn the fea|tures,
of the Count, he recollected them
the moment he beheld him; and not the
Count only, but the per&s;on of the peni|tentiary
An&s;aldo, whom he had &s;een a
frequent Vi&s;itor at the hou&s;e of di Bruno,
though his, appearance, al&s;o, was con&s;i|derably
changed by time, and by the ec|ele&s;ia&s;tical
habit which he now wore.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="299">
The vicar-general &s;eemed &s;till to doubt
the evidence of this man, till An&s;aldo
him&s;elf, on being called upon, remem|bered
him to have been a &s;ervant of the
Count, though he could not identify the
Count him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The grand-inqui&s;itor remarked, that it
was extraordinary he &s;hould recollect the
face of the &s;ervant, yet forget that of the
ma&s;ter, with whom he had lived in ha|bits
of intimacy. To this An&s;aldo re|plied,
that the &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions of Sche|doni,
together with his particular habits
of life, might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to
have wrought a greater change upon the
features of the Count than the character
and circum&s;tances of Giovanni's could
have effected on his.</P>
<P>Schedoni, not without rea&s;on, was
appalled, on the appearance of this &s;er|vant,
who&s;e further te&s;timony gave &s;uch
clearne&s;s and force to &s;ome other parts of
the evidence, that the tribunal pro|nounced
<PB N="299" REF="300">
&s;entence upon Schedoni, as the
murderer of the Count his brother; and
as this, the fir&s;t charge, was &s;ufficient for
his condemnation to death, they did not
proceed upon the &s;econd, that which re|lated
to his wife.</P>
<P>The emotion betrayed by Schedoni, on
the appearance of the la&s;t witne&s;s, and
during the delivery of the evidence, di&s;ap|peared
when his fate became certain;
and when the dreadful &s;entence of the
law was pronounced, it made no vi&s;ible
impre&s;&s;ion on his mind. From that mo|ment,
his firmne&s;s or his hardihood never
for&s;ook him.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who witne&s;&s;ed this condemna|tion,
appeared infinitely more affected by
it than him&s;elf, and, though in revealing
the circum&s;tance of father Nicola's &s;um|mons,
which, had eventually led to the
di&s;covery of Schedoni's crimes, he had
not been left a choice in his conduct, he
felt, at this moment, as mi&s;erable as if
<PB N="300" REF="301">
he had actually borne witne&s;s again&s;t the
life of a fellow being: what, then, would
have been his feelings, had he been told
that this Schedoni, thus condemned, was
the father of Ellena di Ro&s;alba! But,
whatever the&s;e might be, he was &s;oon
condemned to experience them. One of
the mo&s;t powerful of Schedoni's pa&s;&s;ions
appeared even in this la&s;t &s;cene; and as
in quitting the tribunal, he pa&s;&s;ed near
Vivaldi, he uttered the&s;e few words&mdash;
&startq;In me you have murdered the father of
Ellena di Ro&s;alba!&endq;</P>
<P>Not with any hope that the interce&s;&s;ion
of Vivaldi, him&s;elf al&s;o a pri&s;oner, could
in the lea&s;t mitigate a &s;entence pro|nounced
by the Inqui&s;ition, did he &s;ay
this, but for the purpo&s;e of revenging
him&s;elf for the evil, which Vivaldi's evi|dence
had contributed to produce, and
inflicting the exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery &s;uch infor|mation
mu&s;t give. The attempt &s;uc|ceded
too well.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="302">
At fir&s;t, indeed, Vivaldi judged this
to be only the de&s;perate a&s;&s;ertion of a
man, who believed his la&s;t chance of e&s;|caping
the rigour of the law to re&s;t with
him; and, at the mention of Ellena, for|getting
every precaution, he loudly de|manded
to know her &s;ituation. Sche|doni,
throwing upon him an horrible
&s;mile of triumph and deri&s;ion, was pa&s;&s;|ing
forward without replying, but Vi|valdi,
unable to &s;upport this &s;tate of un|certainty,
a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion of the tribu|nal
to conver&s;e, for a few moments, with
the pri&s;oner; a reque&s;t which was granted
with extreme reluctance; and only on
condition that the conver&s;ation &s;hould be
public.</P>
<P>To Vivaldi's que&s;tions, as to the &s;itua|tion
of Ellena, Schedoni only replied,
that &s;he was his daughter, and the &s;o|lemnity,
which accompanied the&s;e repeated
a&s;&s;ertions, though it failed to convince
Vivaldi of this truth, occa&s;ioned him
<PB N="302" REF="303">
agonizing doubt and apprehen&s;ion; but
when the Consfe&s;&s;or, perceiving the po|licy
of di&s;clo&s;ing her place of re&s;idence
to Vivaldi, &s;oftened from his de&s;ire of
vengeance to &s;ecure the intere&s;t of his
family, and named the <HI>Santa della Pi&eacute;ta</HI> as
her pre&s;ent afylum, the joy of &s;uch in|telligence
overcame, for a time, every
other con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>To this dialogue, however, the officials
put a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion; Schedoni was
led back to his cell, and Vivaldi was &s;oon
after ordered to his former clo&s;e confine|ment.</P>
<P>But Paulo became again outrageous,
when he was about to be &s;eparated from
his ma&s;ter, till the latter, having peti|tioned
the tribunal, that his &s;ervant might
accompany him to his pri&s;on, and received
an ab&s;olute re$u&s;al, endeavoured to calm
the violence of his de&s;pair. He $ell at
his ma&s;ter's feet, and &s;hed tears, but he
$ttered no further complaints. When he
<PB N="303" REF="304">
ro&s;e, he turned his eyes in &s;ilence upon
Vivaldi, and they &s;eemed to &s;ay, &startq;Dear
ma&s;ter! I &s;hall never &s;ee you more!&endq; and
with this &s;ad expre&s;&s;ion, he continued to
gaze on him till he had left the hall.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, notwith&s;tanding the various
&s;ubjecls of his di&s;tre&s;s, could not bear to
meet the piteous looks of this poor man,
and he withdrew his eyes; yet, at every
other &s;tep he took, they con&s;tantly return|ed
to his faithful &s;ervant, till the doors
folded him from &s;ight.</P>
<P>When he had quitted the hall, Vivaldi
pleaded, however hopele&s;sly, to the offi|cials,
in favour of Paulo, entreating that
they would &s;peak to the per&s;ons, who kept
guard over him, and prevail with them to
&s;hew him every allowable indulgence.</P>
<P>&startq;No indulgence can be allowed him,&endq;
replied one of the men, &startq;except bread
and water, and the liberty of walking in
his cell.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No <HI>other I&endq;</HI> &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="305">
&startq;None,&endq; repeated the official. &startq;This
pri&s;oner has been near getting one of his
guards into a &s;crape already, for, &s;omehow
or other, he &s;o talked, him over, and won
upon him, (for he is but a young one here)
that the man let him have a light, and a
pen and ink; but, luckily, it was found
out, before any harm was done.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what became of this hone&s;t
fellow?&endq; inquired Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Hone&s;t! he was none &s;o hone&s;t,
either, Signor, if he could; not mind his
duty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Was he puni&s;hed, then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Signor,&endq; replied the man,
pau&s;ing, and looking back upon the long|avenue
they were pa&s;&s;ing, to inquire whe|ther
he was ob&s;erved to hold this conver|&s;ation
with a pri&s;oner: &startq;no, Signor, he
was a younker, &s;o they let him off for
once, and &s;eat him to guard a man, who
was not &s;o full of his coaxing ways.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="306">
&startq;Paulo made him merry, perhaps?&endq;
a&s;ked Vivaldi. &startq;What were the coaxing
ways you &s;poke of?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Merry, Signor! no! he made him
cry, and that was as bad.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi. &startq;The man
mu&s;t have been here, then, a very &s;hort
time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not more than a month, or &s;o,
Signor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But the coaxing ways you talked
of,&endq; repeated Vivaldi, &startq;what were, they?
&mdash;a ducat, or &s;o?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A ducat!&endq; exclaimed the man, &startq;no I
not a <HI>Paolo!&endq;</HI></P>
<P>&startq;Are you <HI>&s;ure</HI> of that?&endq; cried Vi|valdi,
&s;hrewdly.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, &s;ure enough, Signor. This
fellow is not worth a ducat in the
world!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But his ma&s;ter is, friend,&endq; ob&s;erved
Vivaldi, in a very low voice, while he
put &s;ome money into his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="307">
The officer made no an&s;wer but con|cealed
the money, and nothing farther
was &s;aid.</P>
<P>Vivaldi had given this as a bribe, to
procure &s;ome kindne&s;s for his &s;ervant,
not from any con&s;ideration of him&s;elf,
for his own critical &s;ituation had cea&s;ed at
this time to be a &s;ubject of anxiety with
him. His mind was at pre&s;ent &s;trangely
agitated between emotions the mo&s;t op|po&s;ite
in their nature, the joy which a
di&s;covery of Ellena's &s;afety in&s;pired, and
the horrible &s;u&s;picion that Schedoni's a&s;|&s;urances
of relation&s;hip occa&s;ioned. That
his Ellena was the daughter of a mur|derer,
that the father of Ellena &s;hould
be brought to ignominious death, and
that he him&s;elf, however unintentionally,
&s;hould have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to this event, were
con&s;iderations almo&s;t too horrible to be
&s;u&s;tained! Vivaldi &s;ought refuge from
them in various conjectures as to the mo|tive,
which might have induced Schedoni
<PB N="307" REF="308">
to a&s;&s;ert a fal&s;hood in this in&s;tance;
but that of revenge alone appeared plau|&s;ible;
and even this &s;urmi&s;e was weak|ened,
when he con&s;idered that the
Confe&s;&s;or had a&s;&s;ured him of Ellena's
&s;afety, an a&s;&s;urance which, as Vivaldi
did not detect the &s;elfi&s;h policy con|nected
with it, he believed Schedoni
would not have given, had his gene|ral
intent towards him been malicious.
But it was pe&s;&s;ible, that this very in|formation,
on which all his comfort re|po&s;ed,
might be fal&s;e, and had been
given only for the purpo&s;e of inflicting
the angui&s;h a di&s;covery of the truth mu&s;h
lead to! With an anxiety &s;o inten&s;e,
as almo&s;t to overcome his faculty of
judging, he examined every minute pro|bability
relative to this point, and con|cluded
with believing that Schedoni had,
in this la&s;t in&s;tance, at lea&s;t, &s;poken

Whether he had done &s;o in his fir&s;t

<Q><L>O holy nun! why bend the mournful head?</L>
<L>Why fall tho&s;e tears from lids uplift in pray'r?</L>
<L>Why o'er thy pale cheek &s;teals the feeble blu&s;h,</L>
<L>Then fades, and leaves it wan as the lily</L>
<L>On which a moon-beam falls?</L></Q>
<P>WHILE the&s;e events were pa&s;&s;ing in
the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition at Rome,
Ellena, in the &s;anctuary of <HI>Our Lady of
Pity,</HI> remained ignorant of Schedoni's ar|re&s;t,
and of Vivaldi's &s;ituation. She under|&s;tood
that the Confe&s;&s;or was preparing to
acknowledge her for his daughter, and
believed that &s;he comprehended al&s;o the
motive for his ab&s;ence; but, though he
had forbidden her to expect a vi&s;it from
him till his arrangement &s;hould be com|pleted,
he had promi&s;ed to write in the
mean time, and inform her of all the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="310" REF="311">
circum&s;tances of Vivaldi; his unex|pected
&s;ilence had excited, therefore, ap|prehen&s;ions
as various, though not &s;o ter|rible,
as tho&s;e which Vivaldi had &s;uffered
for her; nor did the &s;ilence of Vivaldi
him&s;elf appear le&s;s extraordinary.</P>
<P>&startq;His confinement mu&s;t be &s;evere in|deed,&endq;
&s;aid the afflicted Ellena, &startq;&s;ince
he cannot relieve my anxiety by a &s;ingle
line of intelligence. Or, perhaps, ha|ra&s;&s;ed
by uncea&s;ing oppo&s;ition, he has
&s;ubmitted to the command of his family,
and has con&s;ented to forget me. Ah!
why did I leave the opportunity for that
command to his family; why did I not
enforce it my&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>Yet, while &s;he uttered this &s;elf-reproach,
the tears &s;he &s;hed contradicted the pride
which had &s;ugge&s;ted it; and a conviction
lurking in her heart that Vivaldi could
not &s;o re&s;ign her, &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated tho&s;e
tears. But other conjectures recalled
them; it was po&s;&s;ible that he was ill&mdash;
that he was dead!</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="312">
In &s;uch vague and gloomy &s;urmi&s;e her
days pa&s;&s;ed away; employment could no
longer withdraw her from her&s;elf, nor
mu&s;ic, even for a moment, charm away
the &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow; yet &s;he regularly par|took
of the various occupations of the
nuns; and was &s;o far from permitting
her&s;elf to indulge in any u&s;ele&s;s expre&s;&s;ion
of anxiety, that &s;he had never once di&s;|clo&s;ed
the &s;acred &s;ubject of it; &s;o that,
though &s;he could not a&s;&s;ume an air of
cheerfulne&s;s, &s;he never appeared otherwi&s;e
than tranquil. Her mo&s;t &s;oothing, yet
perhaps mo&s;t melancholy hour, was when
about &s;un-&s;et &s;he could withdraw unno|ticed,
to the terrace among the rocks,
that overlooked the convent, and formed
a part of its domain. There, alone and
relieved from all the ceremonial re&s;traints
of the &s;ociety, her very thoughts &s;eemed
more at liberty. As, from beneath the
light foliage of the accacias, or the more
maje&s;tic &s;hade of the plane-trees that waved
<PB N="312" REF="313">
their branches over the many-coloured
cliffs of this terrace, Ellena looked down,
upon the magnificent &s;cenery of the bay,
it brought back to memory, in &s;ad yet
plea&s;ing detail, the many happy days &s;he
had pa&s;&s;ed on tho&s;e blue waters, or on
the &s;hores, in the &s;ociety of Vivaldi and
her departed relative Bianchi; and every
point of the pro&s;pect marked by &s;uch re|membrance,
which the veiling di&s;tance
&s;tole, was re&s;cued by imagination, and
pictured by affection in tints more ani|mated
than tho&s;e of brighte&s;t nature.</P>
<P>One evening Ellena had lingered on
the terrace later than u&s;ual. She had
watched the rays retiring from the highe&s;t
points of the horizon, and the fading
imagery of the lower &s;cene, till, the &s;un
having &s;unk into the waves, all colouring
was withdrawn, except an empurpling
and repo&s;ing hue, which over&s;pread the
waters and the heavens, and blended in
&s;oft confu&s;ion every feature of the land|&s;cape
<PB N="313" REF="314">
The roofs and &s;lender &s;pires of the
Santa della Pieta, with a &s;ingle tower of
the church ri&s;ing loftily over every other
part of the buildings that cornpo&s;ed the
convent, were fading fa&s;t from the eye;
but the &s;olemn tint that inve&s;ted them
accorded &s;o well with their &s;tyle, that El|lena
was unwilling to relinqui&s;h this in|tere&s;ting
object. Suddenly &s;he perceived
through the dubious light an unu&s;ual
number of moving figures in the court of
the great cloi&s;ter, and li&s;tening, &s;he fan|cied
&s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h the murmuring
of many voices. The white drapery of
the nuns rendered them con&s;picuous as
they moved, but it was impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;|certain
who were the individuals engaged
in this bu&s;tle. Pre&s;ently the a&s;&s;emblage
di&s;per&s;ed; and Ellena, curious to un|der&s;tand
the occa&s;ion of what &s;he had
ob&s;erved, prepared to de&s;cend to the con|vent.</P>
<P>She had left the terrace, and was about
to enter a long avenue of che&s;nuts that
<PB N="314" REF="315">
extended to a part of the convent, com|municating
immediately with the great
court, when &s;he heard approaching &s;teps,
and; on turning into the walk, perceived
&s;everal per&s;ons advancing in the &s;hady
di&s;tance. Among the voices, as they drew
nearer, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed one who&s;e inte|re&s;ting
tone engaged all her attention,
and began al&s;o to awaken memory. She
li&s;tened, wondered, doubted, hoped, and
feared! It &s;poke again! Ellena thought
&s;he could not be deceived in tho&s;e tender
accents, &s;o full of intelligence, &s;o expre&s;&s;ive
of &s;en&s;ibility and refinement. She proceed|ed
with quicker &s;teps, yet faltered, as &s;he
drew near the group, and pau&s;ed to di&s;|cern
whether among them was any figure
that might accord with the voice and ju&s;|tify
her hopes.</P>
<P>The voice &s;poke again; it pronounced,
her name; pronounced it with the trem|blings
of tenderne&s;s and impatience, and
Ellena &s;carcely dared to tru&s;t her &s;en&s;es,
<PB N="315" REF="316">
when &s;he beheld Olivia, the nun of San
Stefano, in the cloi&s;ters of the Della
Pieta!</P>
<P>Ellena could find no words to expre&s;s
her joy and &s;urpri&s;e on beholding her pre|&s;erver
in &s;afety, and in the&s;e quiet groves;
but Olivia repaid all the affectionate ca|re&s;&s;es
of her young friend, and, while &s;he
promi&s;ed to explain the circum&s;tance that
had led to her pre&s;ent appearance here,
&s;he, in her turn, made numerous inqui|ries
relative to Ellena's adventures after
&s;he had quitted San Stefano. They were
now, however, &s;urrounded by too many au|ditors
to allow of unre&s;erved conver&s;ation;
Ellena, therefore, led the nun to her
apartment, and Olivia then explained her
rea&s;ons for having left the convent of San
Stefano, which were indeed &s;ufficient to
ju&s;tify, even with the mo&s;t rigid devotee,
her conduct as to the change. This un|fortunate
reclu&s;e, it appeared, per&s;ecuted
by the &s;u&s;picions of the abbe&s;s, who un|der&s;tood
<PB N="316" REF="317">
that &s;he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the li|beration
of Ellena, had petitioned the
bi&s;hop of her dioce&s;e for leave to remove
to the Santa della Pieta. The abbe&s;e had
not proof to proceed formally again&s;t her,
as an accomplice in the e&s;cape of a novice,
for though Jeronimo could have &s;upplied
the requi&s;ite evidence, he was too deeply
implicated in this adventure to do &s;o with|out
betraying his own conduct. From
his having withheld &s;uch proof, it appears,
however, that accident rather than de&s;ign
had occa&s;ioned his failure on the evening
of Ellena's departure from the mona&s;tery.
But, though the abbe&s;s had not te&s;timony
enough for legal puni&s;hment, &s;he was
acquainted with circum&s;tances &s;ufficient
to ju&s;tify &s;u&s;picion, and had both the in|clination
and the power to render Olivia
very mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>In her choice of the Santa della Pieta,
the nun was influenced by many con&s;ide|rations,
&s;ome of which were the con&s;e|quence
<PB N="317" REF="318">
of conver&s;ations &s;he had held with
Ellena re&s;pecting the &s;tate of that &s;ociety.
Her de&s;ign &s;he had been unable to di&s;|clo&s;e
to her friend, le$t, by a di&s;covery of
&s;uch corre&s;pondence, the abbe&s;s of San
Stefano &s;hould obtain grounds on which
to proceed again&s;t her. Even in her ap|peal
to the bi&s;hop the utmo&s;t caution and
&s;ecrecy had been nece&s;&s;ary, till the order
for her removal, procured not without
con&s;iderable delay and difficulty, arrived,
and when it came, the jealous anger of
the &s;uperior rendered an immediate depar|ture
nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Olivia, during many years, had been
unhappy in her local circum&s;tances, but
it is probable &s;he would have concluded
her days within the walls of San Stefano,
had not the aggravated oppre&s;&s;ion of the
abbe&s;s arou&s;ed her courage and activity,
and di&s;&s;ipated the de&s;pondency, with
which &s;evere misfortune had ob&s;cured her
view.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="319">
Ellena was particular in her inquiries
whether any per&s;on of the mona&s;tery had
&s;uffered for the affi&s;tance they had given
her; but learned that not one, except.
Olivia, had been &s;u&s;pected of befriending
her; and then under&s;tood, that the vene|rable
friar, who had dared to unfa&s;ten
the gate which re&s;tored her with Vivaldi
to liberty, had not been involved by his
kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;It is an embarra&s;&s;ing and rather an
unu&s;ual circum&s;tance,&endq; concluded Olivia,
&startq;to change one's convent; but you per|ceive
the &s;trong rea&s;ons which determined
me upon a removal, I was, however, per|haps,
the more impatient of &s;evere treat|ment,
&s;ince you, my &s;i&s;ter, had de&s;cribed
to me the &s;ociety of <HI>Our Lady of Pity,</HI> and
&s;ince I believed it po&s;&s;ible that you might
form a part of it. When, on my arrival,
here, I learned that my wi&s;hes had not
deceived me on this point, I was impa|tient
to &s;ee you once more, and as &s;oon as
<PB N="319" REF="320">
the ceremonies attending an introduction
to the &s;uperior were over, I reque&s;ted to
be conducted to you, and was in &s;earch of
you when we met in the avenue, It is un|nece&s;&s;ary
for me to in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;atis|faction,
which this meeting gives me; but
you may not, perhaps, under&s;tand how
much the manners of our lady abbe&s;s, and
of the &s;i&s;terhood in general, as far as a
fir&s;t interview will allow me to judge of
them, have re-animated me, The gloom;
which has long hung over my pro&s;pects,
&s;eems now to open, and a di&s;tant gleam
promi&s;es to light up the evening of my
&s;tormy day.&endq;</P>
<P>Olivia pau&s;ed and appeared to recollect
her&s;elf; this was the fir&s;t time &s;he had
made &s;o direct a reference to her own
mis&s;ortunes; and, while Ellena &s;ilently
remarked it, and ob&s;erved the dejection,
which was already &s;tealing upon the ex|pre&s;&s;ive
countenance of the nun, &s;he
wi&s;hed, yet feared to lead her back towards
the &s;ubject of them.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="321">
Endeavouring to di&s;mi&s;s &s;ome painful
remembrance, and a&s;&s;uming a &s;mile of
languid gaiety, Olivia &s;aid, &startq;Now that
I have related the hi&s;tory of my removal,
and &s;ufficiently indulged my egoti&s;m, will
you let me hear what adventures have be|fallen
you, my young friend, &s;ince the
melancholy adieu you gave me in the
gardens of San Stefano.&endq;</P>
<P>This was a ta&s;k, to which Ellena's &s;pi|rits,
though revived by the pre&s;ence of
Olivia, were &s;till unequal. Over the
&s;cenes of her pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;s Time had not yet
drawn his &s;hadowing veil; the colours
were all too fre&s;h and gari&s;h for the meek
dejection of her eye, and the &s;ubject was
too intimately connected with that of her
pre&s;ent anxiety, to be reviewed without
very painful feelings. She therefore re|que&s;ted
Olivia to &s;pare her from a detail
of particulars, which &s;he could not recol|lect
but with extreme reluctance; and,
&s;erupulou&s;ly ob&s;erving the injunction of
<PB N="321" REF="322">
Schedoni, &s;he merely mentioned her &s;e|paration
from Vivaldi upon the banks of
the Celano, and that a variety of di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing
circum&s;tances had intervened before
&s;he could regain the &s;anctuary of the della
Pieta.</P>
<P>Olivia under&s;tood too well the kind of
feelings, from which Ellena was de&s;irous
of e&s;caping, willingly to &s;ubject her to a
renewal of them; and felt too mach ge|nerous
compa&s;&s;ion for her &s;ufferings not
to endeavour to foothe the &s;en&s;e of them
by an exertion of tho&s;e delicate and name|le&s;s
arts which, while they mock detec|tion,
fa&s;cinate the weary &s;pirit as by a
charm of magic!</P>
<P>The friends continued in conver&s;ation,
till a chime from a chapel of the convent
&s;ummoned them to the la&s;t ve&s;pers; and,
when the &s;ervice had concluded, they &s;e|parated
for the night.</P>
<P>With the &s;ociety of the Santa della
Pieta, Olivia had thus &s;ound an a&s;ylum
<PB N="322" REF="323">
$uch as till lately &s;he had never dared to
hope for; but, though &s;he frequently ex|pre&s;&s;ed
her &s;en&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ing, it was
&s;eldom without tears; and Ellena ob|&s;erved,
with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e and more di&s;|appointment,
within a very few days after
her arrival, a cloud of melancholy &s;preading
again over her mind.</P>
<P>But a nearer intere&s;t &s;oon withdrew
Ellena's attention from Olivia to fix it
upon Vivaldi; and, when &s;he &s;aw her in|firm
old &s;ervant, Beatrice, enter a cham|ber
of the convent, &s;he anticipated that
the knowledge of &s;ome extraordinary, and
probably unhappy, event had brought her.
She knew too well the circum&s;pection of
Schedoni to believe that Beatrice came
commi&s;&s;ioned from him; and as the un|certain
&s;ituation of Vivaldi was &s;o con|&s;tantly
the &s;ubject of her anxiety, &s;he im|mediately
concluded that her &s;ervant came
to announce &s;ome evil relative to him.&mdash;
His indi&s;po&s;ition, perhaps his actual con|finement
<PB N="323" REF="324">
in the Inqui&s;ition, which lately
&s;he had &s;ometimes been inclined to think,
might not have been a mere menace to
Vivaldi, though it had proved to be no
more to her&s;elf&mdash;or po&s;&s;ibly &s;he came to
tell of his death&mdash;his death in tho&s;e pri|&s;ons!
This la&s;t was a po&s;&s;ibility that
almo&s;t incapacitated her for inquiring
what was the errand of Beatrice.</P>
<P>The old &s;ervant, trembling and wan,
either from the fatigue of her walk, or
from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of di&s;a&s;trous intelli|gence,
&s;eated her&s;elf without &s;peaking,
and &s;ome moments elap&s;ed before &s;he
could be prevailed with to an&s;wer the re|peated
inquiries of Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;O Signora!&endq; &s;aid &s;he, at length,
&startq;you do not know what it is to walk up
hill &s;uch a long way, at my age! Well!
heaven protect you, I nope you never
will!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I perceive you bring ill news,&endq; &s;aid
Ellena; &startq;I am prepared for it, and you

<P><PB N="324" REF="325">
&startq;Holy San Marco!&endq; exclaimed Bea|trice,
&startq;if death be ill news, you have
gue&s;&s;ed right, Signora, for I do bring
news of that, it is certain. How came
you, Lady, to know my errand? They
have been beforehand with me, I &s;ee,
though I have not walked &s;o fa&s;t up hill
this many a day, as I have now, to tell
you what has happened.&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;topped on ob&s;erving the changing
countenance of Ellena, who tremulou&s;ly
called upon her to explain what had hap|pened
&mdash;who was dead; and entreated
her to relate the particulars as &s;peedily as
po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;aid you was prepared, Sig|nora,&endq;

<P>&startq;What is the event you would di&s;|clo&s;e?&endq;
&s;aid Ellena, almo&s;t breathle&s;s.
&startq;When did it happen?&mdash;be brief.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot tell exactly when it hap|pened,
Signora, but it was an own &s;er|vant
<PB N="325" REF="326">
of the Marche&s;e's that I had it
from.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Marche&s;e's?&endq; interrupted Ellena
in a faltering voice.</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, Lady? you will &s;ay that is
pretty good authority.</P>
<P>&startq;Death! and in the Marche&s;e's fa|mily!&endq;
exclaimed Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signora, I had it from his own
&s;ervant. He was pa&s;&s;ing by the garden|gate
ju&s;t as I happened to be &s;peaking to
the maccaroni-man.&mdash;But you are ill,
Lady!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I am very well, if you will but pro|ceed,&endq;
replied Ellena, &s;aintly, while her
eyes were fixed upon Beatrice, as if they
only had power to enforce her meaning.</P>
<P>&startq;&startq;Well, dame,&endq; he &s;ays to me, &startq;I have
not &s;een you of a long time.&endq; &startq;No,&endq; &s;ays
I, &startq;that is a great grievance truly! for
old women now-a-days are not much
thought of; out of fight out of mind with
them, now-a-days!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="327">
&startq;I be&s;eech you to the purpo&s;e,&endq; inter|rupted
Ellena. &startq;Who&s;e death did he
announce?&endq; She had not courage to
pronounce Vivaldi's name.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;hall hear, Signora. I &s;aw he
looked in a &s;ort of a bu&s;tle, &s;o I a&s;ked him
how all did at the Palazzo: &s;o he an&s;wers,
&startq;Bad enough, Signora Beatrice, have not
you heard?&endq; &startq;Heard,&endq; &s;ays I; &startq;what &s;hould
I have heard?&endq; &startq;Why,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;of what
has ju&s;t happened in our family.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O heavens!&endq; exclaimed Ellena, &startq;he
is dead! Vivaldi is dead.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;hall hear, Signora,&endq; continued
Beatrice.</P>
<P>&startq;Be brief!&endq; &s;aid Ellena, &startq;an&s;wer me
&s;imply yes or no.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot, till I come to the right
place, Signora; if you will but have a
little patience, you &s;hall hear all. But if
you flu&s;ter me &s;o, you will put me quite
out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Grant me patience!&endq; &s;aid Ellena,
endeavouring to calm her &s;pirits.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="328">
&startq;With that, Signora, I a&s;ked him to
Walk in and re&s;t him&s;elf, and tell me
all about it. He an&s;wered, he was
in a great hurry, and could not &s;tay
a moment, and a great deal of that &s;ort;
but I, knowing that whatever happened
in that family, Signora, was &s;omething
to you, would not let him go off &s;o ea|&s;ily;
and &s;o, when I a&s;ked him to refre&s;h
him&s;elf with a gla&s;s of lemon-ice, he for|got
all his bu&s;ine&s;s in a minute, and we
had a long chat.&endq;</P>
<P>And Beatrice might now have conti|nued
her circumlocution, perhaps as long as
&s;he had pleated, for Ellena had lo&s;t all
power to urge inquiry, and was &s;carcely
&s;en&s;ible of what was &s;aid. She neither
&s;poke, nor &s;hed a tear; the one image
that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her fancy, the image of
Vivaldi dead &s;eemed to hold all her facul|ties,
as by a &s;pell.</P>
<P>&startq;So when I a&s;ked him,&endq; added Beatrice,
&startq;again what had happened, he was ready
<PB N="328" REF="329">
enough to tell all about it. &startq;It is near a
month ago&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;&s;ince &s;he was fir&s;t
taken; the Marche&s;a had been&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;The Marche&s;a!&endq; repeated Ellena,
with whom that one word had di&s;&s;olved
the &s;pell of terror&mdash;&startq;the Marche&s;a!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes Signora, to be &s;ure. Who el&s;e
did I &s;ay it was!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Go on, Beatrice; the Marche&s;a?&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;What makes you look &s;o glad all of
a &s;udden, Signora? I thought ju&s;t now
you was very &s;orry about it. What! I
warrant you was thinking about my young
lord, Vivaldi.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Proceed,&endq;&s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;Well!&endq; added Beatrice, &startq;It was
about a month ago that the Marche&s;a was
fir&s;t taken, continued the varlet. &startq;She
had &s;eemed poorly a long time, but it was
from a <HI>conver&s;azione</HI> at the di Voglio pa|lazzo,
that &s;he came home &s;o ill. It is
&s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had been long in a bad &s;tate
of health, but nobody thought her &s;o near
<PB N="329" REF="330">
her end, till the doctors were called to|gether;
and then matters looked very bad
indeed. They found out that &s;he had
been dying, or as good, for many years,
though nobody el&s;e had &s;u&s;pected it, and
the Marche&s;a's own phy&s;ician was blamed
for not finding it out before. But he,&endq;
added the rogue, &startq;had a regard for my
lady. He was very ob&s;tinate, too, for he
kept &s;aying almo&s;t to the la&s;t, there was
no danger, when every body el&s;e &s;aw how
it was going. The other doctors &s;oon
made their words good, and my lady
died.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And her &s;on&endq;&mdash;&s;aid Ellena, &startq;was he
with the Marche&s;a when &s;he expired.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What, Signor Vivaldi, lady? No,
the Signor was not there.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is very, extraordinary!&endq; ob&s;erved
Ellena with emotion. &startq;Did the &s;ervant
mention him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signora; he &s;aid what a &s;ad
thing it was that he &s;hould be out of the
<PB N="330" REF="331">
way at that time, and nobody know
where!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are his family then ignorant where
he is?&endq; a&s;ked Ellena, with increa&s;ed emo|tion.</P>
<P>&startq;To be &s;ure they are, lady, and have
been for the&s;e many weeks. They have
heard nothing at all of the Signor, or one
Paulo M$$drico, his &s;ervent, though the
Marche&s;a's people have been riding po&s;t
after them from one end of the kingdom
to the other all the time!&endq;</P>
<P>Shocked with the conviction of a cir|cum&s;tance,
which, till lately &s;he &s;carcely
believed was po&s;&s;ible, the impri&s;onment
of Vivaldi in the Inqui&s;ition, Ellena lo&s;t
for a while all power of further inquiry;
but Beatrice proceeded.</P>
<P>&startq;The Lady Marche&s;a &s;eemed to lay
&s;omething much to heart, as the man told
me, and often inquired for Signor Vin|centio.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Marche&s;a you are &s;ure then was
ignorant where he was?&endq; &s;aid Ellena,
<PB N="331" REF="332">
with new a&s;toni&s;hment and perplexity as
to the per&s;on who, after betraying him into
the Inqui&s;ition, could yet have &s;uffered
her, though arre&s;ted at the &s;ame time, to
e&s;cape.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Signora, for &s;he wanted &s;adly
to &s;ee him. And when &s;he was dying,
&s;he &s;ent for her Confe&s;&s;or, one father
Schedoni, I think they call him, and&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;What of him? &s;aid Ellena incau|tiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing, Signora, for he could not
be found.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not be found!&endq; repeated Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;No, Signora, not ju&s;t then; he was
Confe&s;&s;or, I warrant, to other people be|&s;ide
the Marche&s;a, and I dare &s;ay they had
&s;ins enough to confe&s;s, &s;o he could not
get away in a hurry.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena recollected her&s;elf &s;ufficiently to
a&s;k no further of Schedoni; and, when &s;he
con&s;idered the probable cau&s;e of Vivaldi's
arre&s;t, she was again con&s;oled by a belief
<PB N="332" REF="333">
that he had not fallen into the power of
real officials, &s;ince the comrades of the
men who had arre&s;ted him, had proved
them&s;elves otherwi&s;e; and &s;he thought it
highly probable, that, while undi&s;covered
by his family, he had been, and was &s;till
engaged in &s;earching for the place of her
confinement.</P>
<P>&startq;But I was &s;aying,&endq; proceeded Beatrice,
&startq;what a bu&s;tle there was when my lady,
the Marche&s;a was dying. As this father
Schedoni was not to be found, another
Confe&s;&s;or was &s;ent for, and &s;hut up with
her for along while indeed! And then
my Lord Marche&s;e was called in, and
there &s;eemed to be a deal going forward,
for my Lord was heard every now and then
by the attendants in the anti-chamber,
talking loud, and&endq; &s;ometimes my Lady
Marche&s;a's voice was heard too, though
&s;he was &s;o ill! At la&s;t all was &s;ilent, and
after &s;ome time my Lord came put of the
room, and he &s;eemed very much flu&s;tered;
<PB N="333" REF="334">
they &s;ay, that is, very angry and yet very
&s;orrowful. But the Confe&s;&s;or remained
with my Lady for a long while after; and,
when he departed, my Lady appeared
more unhappy than ever. &startq;She lived all
that night and part of the next day, and
&s;omething &s;eemed to lie very heavy at her
heart, for &s;he &s;ometimes wept, but oftener
groaned, and would look &s;o, that it was
piteous to &s;ee her. She frequently a&s;ked
for the Marche&s;e, and when he came, the
attendants were &s;ent away, and they held
long conferences by them&s;elves. The Con|fe&s;&s;or
al&s;o was &s;ent for again, ju&s;t at the la&s;t,
and they were all &s;hut up together. After
this, my Lady appeared more ea&s;y in her
mind, and not long after &s;he died.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena, who had attended clo&s;ely to
this little narrative, was prevented for the
pre&s;ent from a&s;king the few que&s;tions
which it had &s;ugge&s;ted, by the entrance
of Olivia, who, on perceiving a &s;tranger,
was retiring, but Ellena, not con&s;idering
<PB N="334" REF="335">
the&s;e inquiries as important, prevail|ed
with the nun to take a chair
at the embroidery frame &s;he had lately
quitted.</P>
<P>After conver&s;ing for a few moments
with Olivia, &s;he returned to a con&s;idera|tion
of her own intere&s;ts. The ab&s;ence
of Schedoni &s;till appeared to her as &s;ome|thing
more than accidental; and, though
&s;he could not urge any inquiry with Bea|trice,
concerning the monk of the Spirito
Santo, &s;he ventured to a&s;k whether &s;he
had lately &s;een the &s;tranger, who had re|&s;tored
her to Altieri, for Beatrice knew
him only in the character of Ellena's de|liverer.</P>
<P>&startq;No, Signora,&endq; replied Beatrice rather
&s;harply, &startq;I have never &s;een his face &s;ince
he attended you to the villa, though for
that matter, I did not &s;ee much of it there;
and then how he contrived to let him&s;elf out
of the hou&s;e that night without my &s;eeing
him, I cannot divine, though I have thought
<PB N="335" REF="336">
of it often enough &s;ince. I am &s;ure he
need not to have been a&s;hamed to have
&s;hewn his face to me, for I &s;hould only
have ble&s;&s;ed him for bringing you &s;afe
home again!&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena was &s;omewhat &s;urprized to find
that Beatrice had noticed a circum&s;tance
apparently &s;o trivial, and replied, that &s;he
had her&s;elf opened the door for her pro|tector.</P>
<P>While Beatrice &s;poke, Olivia rai&s;ing
her eyes from the embroidery, had fixed
them upon the old &s;ervant, who re&s;pect|fully
withdrew her's; but, when the nun
was again engaged on her work, &s;he re|&s;umed
her ob&s;ervation. Ellena fancied
&s;he perceived, &s;omething extraordinary in
this mutual examination, although the
curio&s;ity of &s;trangers towards each other
might have accounted for it.</P>
<P>Beatrice then received directions from
Ellena as to &s;ome drawings, which &s;he
wi&s;hed to have &s;ent to the convent, and
<PB N="336" REF="337">
when the &s;ervant &s;poke in reply, Olivia
again rai&s;ed her eyes, and fixed them on
her face with inten&s;e curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>&startq;I certainly ought to know that voice,&endq;
&s;aid the nun with great emotion, &startq;though
I dare not judge from your features. Is
it,&mdash;can it be po&s;&s;ible!&mdash;is it Beatrice
Olca, to whom I &s;peak? So many years
have pa&s;&s;ed&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Beatrice with equal &s;urprize an&s;wered,
&startq;It is, Signora; you are right in my
name. But, lady, who are you that
know me?&endq;</P>
<P>While &s;he earne&s;tly regarded Olivia,
there was an expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;may in her
look, which increa&s;ed Ellena's perplexity.
The nun's complexion varied every in&s;tant,
and her words failed when &s;he attempted
to &s;peak. Beatrice meanwhile exclaimed,
&startq;My eyes deceive me! yet there is a
&s;trange likene&s;s. Santa della Pieta! how it
has fluttered me! my heart beats &s;till&mdash;
you are &s;o like her, lady, yet you are very
different too.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="338">
Olivia, who&s;e regards were now entirely
fixed upon Ellena, &s;aid in a voice that
was &s;carcely, articulate, while her whole
frame &s;eemed &s;inking beneath &s;ome irre&s;i&s;|tible
feeling, &startq;Tell me, Beatrice, I con|jure
you, quickly &s;ay, who is this?&endq;&mdash;
She pointed to Ellena, and the &s;entence
died on her lips.</P>
<P>Beatrice wholly occupied by intere&s;ts
of her own, gave no reply, but exclaimed,
&startq;It is in truth the Lady Olivia! It is
her&s;elf! In the name of all that is &s;acred,
how came you here? O! how glad you
mu&s;t have been to find-one another out!&endq;
She looked, &s;till ga&s;ping with a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
at Olivia, while Ellena, unheard,
repeatedly inquired the meaning of her
words, and in the next moment found
her&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed to the bo&s;om of the nun,
who &s;eemed better to have under&s;tood
them, and who weeping, trembling, and
almost fainting, held her there in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Ellena, after &s;ome moments had thus
pa&s;&s;ed, reque&s;ted an explanation of what
<PB N="338" REF="339">
&s;he witne&s;&s;ed, and Beatrice at the &s;ame
time demanded the cau&s;e of all this emo|tion.
&startq;For can it be that you did not
know one another?&endq; &s;he added.</P>
<P>&startq;What new di&s;covery is this?&endq; &s;aid
Ellena, fearfully to the nun. &startq;It is but
lately that I have found my father! O tell
me by what tender name I am to call
you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your father!&endq; exclaimed Olivia.</P>
<P>&startq;Your father, lady!&endq; echoed Beatrice.</P>
<P>Ellena, betrayed by &s;trong emotion into
this premature mention of Sch&eacute;doni, was
embarra&s;&s;ed and remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>&startq;No, my child!&endq; &s;aid Olivia, &s;often|ing
from amazement into tones of ineffable
&s;orrow, while &s;he again pre&s;&s;ed Ellena to
her heart&mdash;&startq;No!&mdash;thy father is in the
grave!&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena no longer returned her care&s;&s;es;
&s;urprize and doubt &s;u&s;pended every tender
emotion; &s;he gazed upon Olivia with an
inten&s;ene&s;s that partook of wildne&s;s. At
<PB N="339" REF="340">
length &s;he &s;aid &s;lowly&mdash;&endq; It is my mother,
then, whom I &s;ee! When will the&s;e di&s;|coveries
end!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is your mother!&endq; replied Olivia
&s;olemnly, &startq;a mother's ble&s;&s;ing re&s;ts with
you!&endq;</P>
<P>The nun endeavoured to &s;oothe the
agitated &s;pirits of Ellena, though &s;he was
her&s;elf nearly overwhelmed by the various
and acute feelings this di&s;clo&s;ure occa|&s;ioned.
For a con&s;iderable time they were
unable to &s;peak but in &s;hort &s;entences of
affectionate exclamation, but joy was evi|dently
a more predominant feeling with
the parent than with the child. When,
however, Ellena could weep, &s;he became
more tranquil, and by degrees was &s;en|&s;ible
of a degree of happine&s;s, &s;uch as &s;he
had perhaps never experienced.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Beatrice &s;eemed lo&s;t in
amazement mingled with fear. She ex|pre&s;&s;ed
no plea&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding the
the joy &s;he witne&s;&s;ed, but was uniformly
grave and ob&s;ervant.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="341">
Olivia, when &s;he recovered &s;ome degree
of compo&s;ure, inquired for her &s;i&s;ter
Bianchi. The &s;ilence and &s;udden dejec|tion
of Ellena indicated the truth. On
this mention of her late mi&s;tre&s;s, Beatrice
recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! lady,&endq; &s;aid the old &s;ervant,
&startq;&s;he is now where I believed you were!
and I &s;hould as &s;oon have expected to &s;ee
my dear mi&s;tre&s;s here as your&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>Olivia, though affected by this intelli|gence,
did not feel it with the acutene&s;s &s;he
would have done probably at any other
moment. After &s;he had indulged her
tears, &s;he added, that from the unu&s;ual
&s;ilence of Bianchi, &s;he had &s;u&s;pected the
truth, and particularly &s;ince not any an|&s;wer
had been returned to the letter &s;he
had &s;ent to Altieri upon her arrival at the
Santa della Pi&eacute;ta.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas!&endq; &s;aid Beatrice, &startq;I wonder
much my lady abbe&s;s failed to tell you
the &s;ad news, for &s;he knew it too well!&mdash;
<PB N="341" REF="342">
My dear mi&s;tre&s;s is buried in the church
here! as for the letter, I have brought it
with me for Signora Ellena to open.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The lady abbe&s;s is not informed of
our relation&s;hip,&endq; replied Olivia, &startq;and I
have particular rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing that at
pre&s;ent &s;he &s;hould remain ignorant of it.
Even you, my Ellena, mu&s;t appear only
as my friend, till &s;ome inquiries have been
made, which are e&s;&s;ential to my peace.&endq;</P>
<P>Olivia required an explanation of El|lena's
late extraordinary a&s;&s;ertion re&s;pect|ing
her father, but this was a reque&s;t
made with emotions very different from
tho&s;e which hope or joy in&s;pire. Ellena, be|lieving
that the &s;ame circum&s;tances which
had deceived her&s;elf during &s;o many years,
as to his death, had al&s;o mi&s;led Olivia,
was not &s;urprized at the incredulity her
mother had &s;hewn, but &s;he was con&s;ide|rably
embarra&s;&s;ed how to an&s;wer her in|quiries.
It was now too late to ob&s;erve
the promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy extorted from her
<PB N="342" REF="343">
by Schedoni; the fir&s;t moments of &s;ur|prize
had betrayed her: yet, while &s;he
trembled further to tran&s;gre&s;s his injunc|tion,
&s;he perceived that a fall explanation
was now unavoidable. And, &s;ince Ellena
con&s;idered, that as Schedoni could not
have, fore&s;een her pre&s;ent peculiar &s;itu|tion,
his command had no reference to
her mother, her &s;eruples on this head di&s;|appeared.
When, therefore, Beatrice had
withdrawn, Ellena repeated her a&s;&s;ertion,
that her father &s;till lived; which, though
it increa&s;ed the amazement of Olivia, did
not vanqui&s;h her incredulity. Olivia's
tears flowed fa&s;t, while in contra diction to
this a&s;&s;urance, &s;he mentioned the year in
which the Count de Bruno died, with
&s;ome circum&s;tances relative to his death;
which, however, as Ellena under&s;tood
that her mother had not witne&s;&s;ed it, &s;he
&s;till believed had not happened. To
confirm her late a&s;&s;ertion, Ellena then
related a few particulars of her &s;econd
<PB N="343" REF="344">
interview with Schedoni, and as &s;ome
confirmation that he lived, offered to
produce the portrait, which he had claimed
as his own. Olivia, in great agitation,
reque&s;ted to &s;ee the miniature, and Ellena
left the apartment in &s;earch of it.</P>
<P>Every moment of her ab&s;ence was to
Olivia's expectation lengthened to an
hour; &s;he paced the room; li&s;tened for a
foot&s;tep; endeavoured to tranquillize her
&s;pirits, and &s;till Ellena did not return.
Some &s;trange my&s;tery &s;eemed to lurk in
the narrative &s;he had ju&s;t heard, which
&s;he wi&s;hed, yet dreaded to develope; and
when, at length, Ellena appeared with
the miniature, &s;he took it in trembling
eagerne&s;s, and haying gazed upon it for
an in&s;tant, her Complexion faded and &s;he
fainted.</P>
<P>Ellena had now no doubt respecting the
truth of Schedoni's declaration, and blam|ed
her&s;elf for not having more gradually
prepared her mother for the knowledge of
<PB N="344" REF="345">
a circum&s;tance, which &s;he believed had
overwhelmed her with joy. The u&s;ual
applications, however, &s;oon re&s;tored Oli|via,
who, when &s;he was again alone with
her daughter, de&s;ired to behold once
more the portrait. Ellena, attributing the
&s;trong emotion, with which &s;he &s;till regard|ed
it, to &s;urprize, and fear le&s;t &s;he was ad|mitting
a fallacious hope, endeavoured to
comfort her by renewed a&s;&s;urances, that
not only the Count di Bruno yet exi&s;ted,
but that he lived at this very time in
Naples, and further, that he would pro|bably
be in her pre&s;ence within the hour,
&startq;When I quitted the room for the minia|ture,&endq;
added Ellena, &startq;I di&s;patched a
per&s;on with a note, reque&s;ting to &s;ee my
father immediately, being impatient to
realize the joy, which &s;uch a meeting be|tween
my long lo&s;t parents mu&s;t occa&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>In this in&s;tance Ellena had certainly
&s;uffered her generous &s;ympathy to over|come
her di&s;cretion, for, though the con|tents
<PB N="345" REF="346">
of the note to Schedoni could not
po&s;itively have betrayed him, had he even
been in Naples at this time, her &s;ending it
to the Spirito Santo, in&s;tead of the place
which he had appointed for his letters,
might have led to a premature inquiry re|&s;pecting
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>While Ellena had acquainted Olivia
that Schedoni would probably be with
them &s;oon, &s;he watched eagerly for the
joyful &s;urprize &s;he expected would appear
on her countenance; how &s;evere then
was her di&s;appointment when only terror
and di&s;may were expre&s;&s;ed$ there! and,
when, in the next$ moment her mother
uttered exclamations of di&s;tre&s;s and even
of de&s;pair!</P>
<P>&startq;If he &s;ees me,&endq; &s;aid Olivia, &startq;I am
irrecoverably lo&s;t! O! unhappy Ellena!
your precipitancy has de&s;troyed me. The
original of this portrait is not the Count di
Bruno, <HI>my</HI> dear lord, nor your parent,
but his brother, the cruel hu&s;band&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="347">
Olivia left the &s;entence unfini&s;hed,
as if &s;he was betraying more than was at
pre&s;ent di&s;creet; but Ellena, whom a&s;to|ni&s;hment
had kept &s;ilent, now entreated
that &s;he would explain her words, and
the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;I know not,&endq; &s;aid Olivia, &startq;by what
means that portrait has been conveyed to
you; but it is the re&s;emblance of the
Count Ferando di Bruno, the brother of
my lord, and my&endq;&mdash;&s;econd hu&s;band &s;he
&s;hould have &s;aid, but her lips refu&s;ed to
honour him with the title.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed and was much affected, but
pre&s;ently added&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot at pre&s;ent explain the &s;ubject
more fully, for it is to me a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing
one. Let me rather con&s;ider the means
of avoiding an interview with di Bruno,
and even of concealing, if po&s;&s;ible, that
I exi&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Olivia was, however, &s;oothed when &s;he
under&s;tood that Ellena had not named her
<PB N="347" REF="348">
in the note, but had merely de&s;ired to &s;ee
the Confe&s;&s;or upon a very particular oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>While they were con&s;ulting upon the
excu&s;e it would be nece&s;&s;ary to form for
this imprudent &s;ummons, the me&s;&s;enger
returned with the note unopened, and
with information, that father Schedoni
was abroad on a pilgrimage, which was
the explanation the brothers of the Spirito
Santo cho&s;e to give of his ab&s;ence; judg|ing
it prudent, for the honour of their
convent, to conceal his real &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Olivia, thus relea&s;ed from her fears,
con&s;ented to explain &s;ome points of the
&s;ubject &s;o intere&s;ting to Ellena; but it
was not till &s;everal days after this di&s;covery,
that &s;he could, &s;ufficiently command her
&s;pirits to relate the whole of her narrative.
The fir&s;t part of it agreed perfectly with the
account delivered in the confe&s;&s;ion to the
penitentiary An&s;aldo; that which follows
was known only to her&s;elf, her &s;i&s;ter
<PB N="348" REF="349">
Bianchi, a phy&s;ician, and one faithful
&s;ervant, who had been con&s;iderably en|tru&s;ted
with the conduct of the plan.</P>
<P>It may be recollected that, Schedoni
left his hou&s;e immediately after the
act, which was de&s;igned to be fatal to the
Counte&s;s his wife, and that &s;he was car|ried
&s;en&s;ele&s;s to her chamber. The
wound, as appears, was not mortal. But
the atrocity of the intent determined her
to &s;eize the opportunity thus offered by
the ab&s;ence of Schedoni, and her own
peculiar circum&s;tances, to relea&s;e her&s;elf
from his tyranny without having recour&s;e
to a court of ju&s;tice, which would have
covered with infamy the brother of
her fir&s;t hu&s;band. She withdrew,
therefore, from his hou&s;e for ever, and
with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the three per&s;ons
before-mentioned, retired to a remote part
of Italy, and &s;ought refuge in the convent
of San Ste&s;ano, while at home the report of
her death was confirmed by a public funeral.
<PB N="349" REF="350">
Bianchi remained for &s;ome time after the
departure of Olivia, in her own re&s;idence
near the Villa di Bruno, having taken
under her immediate care the daughter of
the Counte&s;s and of the fir&s;t Count di
Bruno, as well as ah infant daughter of
the &s;econd.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time had elap&s;ed, Bianchi
withdrew with her young charge, but not
to the neighbourhood of San Ste&s;ano.
The indulgence of a mother's tenderne&s;s
was denied to Olivia, for Bianchi could
could not re&s;ide near the convent without
&s;ubjecting her to the hazard of a di&s;covery,
&s;ince Schedoni, though he now believed
the report of her death, might be led to
doubt it, by the conduct of Bianchi,
who&s;e &s;teps would probably be ob&s;erved
by him. She cho&s;e a re&s;idence, therefore,
at a di&s;tance from Olivia, though not yet at
Altieri. At this period, Ellena was not two
years old; the daughter of Schedoni was
&s;carcely as many months, and &s;he died
<PB N="350" REF="351">
before the year concluded. It was this his
child, for whom the Confe&s;&s;or, who had
too well concealed him&s;elf to permit Bianchi
to acquaint him with her death, had mi&s;|taken
Ellena, and to which mi&s;take his
own portrait, affirmed by Ellena to be
that of her father, had contributed. This
miniature &s;he had found in the cabinet of
Bianchi after her aunt's decea&s;e, and, ob|&s;erving
it in&s;cribed with the title of Count
di Bruno, &s;he had worn it with a filial
fondne&s;s ever &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>Bianchi, when &s;he had acquainted
Ellena with the &s;ecret of her birth, was
withheld, both by prudence and humanity,
from intru&s;ting her with a knowledge that
her mother lived; but this, no doubt, was
the circum&s;tance &s;he appeared &s;o anxious
to di&s;clo&s;e on her death-bed, when the
&s;uddenne&s;s of her di&s;order had deprived
her of the power. The abruptne&s;s ot
that event had thus contributed to keep
the mother and daughter unknown to
<PB N="351" REF="352">
each other, even when they afterwards
accidentally met, to which concealment
the name of Ro&s;alba, given to Ellena
from her infancy by Bianchi, for the pur|po&s;e
of protecting her from di&s;covery by
her uncle, had a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Beatrice, who
was not the dome&s;tic intru&s;ted with the
e&s;cape of Olivia, had believed the report
of her death, and thus, though &s;he knew
Ellena to be the daughter of the Counte&s;s
di Bruno, &s;he could never have been a
means of di&s;covering them to each other,
had it not happened that Olivia recognized
this ancient &s;ervant of Bianchi, while
Ellena was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>When Bianchi came to re&s;ide in the
neighbourhood of Naples, &s;he was un&s;u&s;|picious
that Schedoni, who had never
been heard of &s;ince the night of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, inhabited there; and &s;he &s;o
&s;eldom left her hou&s;e, that it is not &s;ur|prizing
&s;he &s;hould never happen to meet
him, at lea&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ly; for her veil,
<PB N="352" REF="353">
and the monk's cowl, might ea&s;ily have
concealed them from each other if they
had met.</P>
<P>It appears to have been the intention of
Bianchi to di&s;clo&s;e to Vivaldi the family of
Ellena, before their nuptials were &s;olem|nized;
&s;ince, on the evening of their la&s;t
conversation, &s;he had declared, when her
&s;pirits were exhau&s;ted by the exertion &s;he
had made, that much remained for her to
&s;ay, which weakne&s;s obliged her to defer
till another opportunity. Her unexpected
death prevented any future meeting.
That &s;he had not &s;ooner intended to make
a communication, which might have re|moved,
in a con&s;iderable degree, the ob|jection
of the Vivaldi to a connection with
Ellena, appears extraordinary, till other
circum&s;tances of her family, than that of
its nobility, are con&s;idered. Her pre&s;ent
indigence, and yet more, the guilt attach|ed
to an individual of the di Bruno, it was
rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e would operate as a
<PB N="353" REF="354">
full antidote to the allurement of rank,
however jealous of birth the Vivaldi had
proved them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Ferando di Bruno had contrived, even
in the &s;hort interval between the death of
his brother and the &s;uppo&s;ed decea&s;e of
his wife, again to embarra&s;s his affairs,
and &s;oon after his flight, the income ari&s;|ing
from what remained of his landed
property had been &s;eized upon by his
creditors, whether lawfully or not, he
was then in a &s;ituation which did not per|mit
him to conte&s;t, and Ellena was thus
left wholly dependent upon her aunt.
The &s;mall fortune of Bianchi had been
dimini&s;hed by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he afforded
Olivia, for who&s;e admittance into the
convent of San Stefano it had been nece&s;|&s;ary
to advance a con&s;iderable &s;um; and
her original income was afterwards re|duced
by the purcha&s;e of the villa Altieri.
This expenditure, however, was not an
imprudent one, &s;ince &s;he preferred the
<PB N="354" REF="355">
comforts and independence of a plea&s;ant
home, with indu&s;try, to the indulgence
of an indolence which mu&s;t have confined
her to an inferior residence; and was
acquainted with the means of making this
indu&s;try profitable without being di&s;ho|nourable.
She excelled in many elegant
and ingenious arts, and the productions
of her pencil and needle were privately
di&s;po&s;ed of to the nuns of the Santa della
Pieta. When Ellena was of an age to
a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;he re&s;igned much of the em|ployment
and the profit to her niece,
who&s;e genius having unfolded it&s;elf, the
beauty of her de&s;igns and the elegance of
her execution, both in drawings and em|broidery,
were &s;o highly valued by the
purcha&s;ers at the grate of the convent, that
Bianchi committed to Ellena altogether
the exerci&s;e of her art.</P>
<P>Olivia meanwhile had dedicated her life
to devotion in the mona&s;tery of San Ste|fano,
a choice which was willingly made
<PB N="355" REF="356">
while her mind was yet &s;oftened by grief
for the death of her fir&s;t lord, and wearied
by the cruelty &s;he had afterwards experi|enced.
The fir&s;t years of her retirement
were pa&s;&s;ed in tranquillity, except when the
remembrance of her child, whom &s;he did
not dare to &s;ee at the convent, awakened
a parental pang. With Bianchi &s;he,
however, corre&s;ponded as regularly as
opportunity would allow, and had at lea&s;t
the con&s;olation of knowing, that the ob|ject
mo&s;t dear to her lived, till, within a
&s;hort period of Ellena's arrival at the
very a&s;ylum cho&s;en by her mother, her
apprehen&s;ions were in &s;ome degree excited
by the unu&s;ual &s;ilence of Bianchi.</P>
<P>When Olivia had fir&s;t &s;een Ellena in
the chapel of San Stefano, &s;he was &s;truck
with a &s;light re&s;emblance &s;he bore to the
late Count di Bruno, and had frequently
afterwards examined her features with a
mo&s;t painful curio&s;ity; but, circum&s;tanced
as &s;he was, Olivia could not rea&s;onably
<PB N="356" REF="357">
&s;u&s;pect the &s;tranger to be her daughter.
Once, however, a &s;en&s;e of this po&s;&s;ibility
&s;o far overcame her judgment, as to
prompt an inquiry for the &s;irname of
Ellena; but the mention of Ro&s;alba had
checked all further conjecture. What
would have been the feelings of the nun,
had &s;he been told when her generous
compa&s;&s;ion was a&s;&s;i&s;ting a &s;tranger to
e&s;cape from oppre&s;&s;ion that &s;he was pre|&s;erving
her own child! It may be worthy
of ob&s;ervation, that the virtues of Olivia,
exerted in a general cau&s;e, had thus led
her uncon&s;ciou&s;ly to the happine&s;s of
&s;aving her daughter; while the vices of
Schedoni had as uncon&s;ciou&s;ly urged him
nearly to de&s;troy his niece, and had always
been preventing, by the means they
prompted him to employ, the &s;uccess of
his con&s;tant aim.</P>

<BIBL>YOUNG.</BIBL>
<P>THE Marche&s;a di Vivaldi, of who&s;e
death Beatrice had given an imperfect
account, &s;truck with remor&s;e of the crime
&s;he had meditated again&s;t Ellena, and
with terror of the puni&s;hment due to it,
had &s;ent, when on her death-bed, for a
Confe&s;&s;or, to whom &s;he uhburthened her
con&s;cience, and from whom &s;he hoped
to receive, in return, an alleviation of
her de&s;pair. This Confe&s;&s;or was a man
of good &s;en&s;e and humanity; and, when
he fully under&s;tood the &s;tory of Vivaldi
and Ellena di Ro&s;alba, he declared, that
<PB N="358" REF="359">
her only hope of forgivene&s;s, both for
the crime &s;he had meditated, and the un|de&s;erved
&s;ufferings &s;he had occa&s;ioned,
re&s;ted upon her willingne&s;s to make tho&s;e
now happy, whom &s;he had formerly ren|dered
mi&s;erable. Her con&s;cience had al|ready
given her the &s;ame le&s;&s;on; and,
now that &s;he was &s;inking to that grave
which levels all di&s;tinctions, and had
her ju&s;t fear of retribution no longer op|po&s;ed
by her pride, &s;he became as anxious
to promote the marriage of Vivaldi with
Ellena as &s;he had ever been to prevent it.
She &s;ent, therefore, for the Marche&s;e;
and, having made an avowal of the arts
&s;he had practi&s;ed again&s;t the peace and
reputation of Ellena, without, however,
confe&s;&s;ing the full extent of her intended
crimes, &s;he made it her la&s;t reque&s;t, that
he would con&s;ent to the happine&s;s of
his &s;on.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e, however, &s;hocked as
he was at this di&s;covery of the duplicity
<PB N="359" REF="360">
and cruelty of his wife, had neither her
terror of the future, or remor&s;e for the
pa&s;t, to overcome his objection to the
rank of Ellena; and he re&s;i&s;ted all
her importunity, till the angui&s;h of her
la&s;t hours overcame every con&s;ideration
but that of affording her relief; he then
gave a &s;olemn promi&s;e, in the pre&s;ence
of the Confe&s;&s;or, that he would no lon|ger
oppo&s;e the marriage of Vivaldi and
Ellena, &s;hould the former per&s;i&s;t in his
attachment to her. This promi&s;e was
&s;ufficient for the Marche&s;a, and &s;he died
with &s;ome degree of re&s;ignation. It did
not, however, appear probable, that the
Marche&s;e would &s;oon be called upon to
fulfil the engagements, into which he had
&s;o unwillingly entered, every inquiry after
Vivaldi having been hitherto ineffectual.</P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of this fruitle&s;s
&s;earch for his &s;on, and while the Mar|che&s;e
was almo&s;t lamenting him as dead,
the inhabitants of the Vivaldi palace
<PB N="360" REF="361">
were, one night, arou&s;ed from &s;leep by a
violent knocking at the great gate of the
court. The noi&s;e was &s;o loud and ince&s;|&s;ant,
that, before the porter could obey
the &s;ummons, the Marche&s;e, who&s;e apart|ment
looked upon the court, was alarm|ed,
and &s;ent an attendant from his anti|room,
to inquire the occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently a voice was heard from the
fir&s;t anti-chamber, exclaiming, &startq;I mu&s;t
&s;ee my Lord Marche&s;e directly; he will
not be angry to be waked, when he
knows all about it;&endq; and, before the
Marche&s;e could order that no per&s;on, on
whatever pretence, &s;hould be admitted,
Paulo, haggard, ragged, and covered with
dirt, was in the chamber. His wan and
affrighted countenance, his di&s;ordered
dre&s;s, and his very attitude, as on enter|ing
he half turned to look back upon
the anti-rooms, like one, who, ju&s;t e&s;|caped
from bondage, li&s;tens to the fan|cied
&s;ounds of pur&s;uit, were altogether
<PB N="361" REF="362">
&s;o &s;uiking and terrific, that the Marche&s;e,
anticipating &s;ome dreadful news of Vi|valdi,
had &s;carcely power to inquire for
him. Paulo, however, rendered que&s;|tions
unnece&s;&s;ary; for, without any cir|cumlocution,
or preface, he immedi|ately
informed the Marche&s;e, that the
Signor, his dear ma&s;ter, was in the pri|&s;ons
of the Inqui&s;ition, at Rome, if, in|deed,
they had not put an end to him be|fore
that time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, my Lord,&endq; &s;aid Paulo, &startq;I am
ju&s;t got out my&s;elf, for they would not
let me be with the Signor, &s;o it was of
no u&s;e to &s;tay there any longer. Yet it
was a hard matter with me to go away,
and leave my deaf ma&s;ter within tho&s;e
di&s;inal walls; and nothing &s;hould have
per&s;uaded me to do &s;o, but that I hoped,
when your Lord&s;hip knew where the Sig|nor
was, you might be able to get him
out. But there is not a minute to be lo&s;t,
my Lord, for when once a gentleman has
<PB N="362" REF="363">
got within the claws of tho&s;e inqui&s;itors,
there is no knowing how &s;oon they may
take it in their heads to tear him in
pieces. Shall I order hor&s;es for Rome,
my Lord? I am ready to &s;et off again
directly.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;uddenne&s;s of &s;uch intelligence,
concerning an only &s;on, might have agi|tated
&s;tronger nerves than tho&s;e of the
Marche&s;e, and &s;o much was he &s;hocked
by it, that he could not immediately de|termine
how to proceed, or give any
an&s;wer to Paulo's repeated que&s;tions.
When, however, he became &s;ufficiently
recollected to make further inquiry into
the &s;ituation of Vivaldi, he perceived the
nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate journey; but
fir&s;t it would be prudent to con&s;ult with
&s;ome friends, who&s;e connections at Rome
might be a means of greatly facilitating
the important purpo&s;e, which led him
thither, and this could not be done till
the following morning. Yet, he gave
orders, that preparation &s;hould be made
<PB N="363" REF="364">
for his &s;etting out at a moment's notice;
and, having li&s;tened to as full an account
as Paulo could give of the pa&s;t and pre|&s;ent
circum&s;tances of Vivaldi, he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
him to repo&s;e for the remainder of
the night.</P>
<P>Paulo, however, though much in want
of re&s;t, was in too great an agitation of
&s;pirits either to &s;eek or to find it; and the
fear he had indicated, on entering the
Marche&s;e's apartment, proceeded from
the hurry of his mind, rather than from
any po&s;itive apprehen&s;ion of new evil.
For his liberty he was indebted to the
young centinel, who had on a former oc|ca&s;ion
been removed from the door of
his pri&s;on, but who, by means of the
guard, to whom Vivaldi had given mo|ney,
as he returned one night from the
tribunal, had &s;ince been able to commu|nicate
with him. This man, of a na|ture
too humane for his &s;ituation, was
become wretched in it, and he deter|mined
<PB N="364" REF="365">
to e&s;cape from his office before
the expiration of the time, for which he
had been engaged. He thought that to
be a guard over pri&s;oners was nearly as
mi&s;erable as being a pri&s;oner him&s;elf. &startq;I
&s;ee no difference between them,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;except that the pri&s;oner watches on one
&s;ide of the door, and the centinel on the
other.&endq;</P>
<P>With the re&s;olution to relea&s;e him&s;elf,
he conferred with Paulo, who&s;e good na|ture
and feeling heart, among &s;o many
people of a contrary character, had won
his confidence and affection, and he laid
his plan of e&s;cape &s;o well, that it was on
the point of &s;ucceeding, when Paulo's
ob&s;tinacy in attempting an impo&s;&s;ibility
had nearly counteracted the whole. It
went to his heart, he &s;aid, to leave his
ma&s;ter in pri&s;on, while he him&s;elf was
to march off in &s;afety, and he would
run the ri&s;k of his neck, rather than
have &s;uch a deed upon his head. He
<PB N="365" REF="366">
propo&s;ed, therefore, as Vivaldi's guards
were of too ferocious a nature to be tam|pered
with, to &s;cale a wall of the court
into which a grate of Vivaldi's dungeon
looked. But had this lofty wall been
practicable, the grate was not; and the
attempt had nearly co&s;t Paulo not only his
liberty, but his life.</P>
<P>When, at length, he had made his
way through the perilous avenues of the
pri&s;on, and was fairly beyond the walls,
he could hardly be prevailed upon by his
companion to leave them. For near an
hour, he wandered under their &s;hade,
weeping and exclaiming, and calling up|on
his dear ma&s;ter, at the evident hazard
of being retaken; and probably would
have remained there much longer, had
not the dawn of morning rendered his
companion de&s;perate. Ju&s;t, however, as
the man was forcing him away, Paulo
fancied he di&s;tingui&s;hed, by the &s;trength|ening
light, the roof of that par|ticular
<PB N="366" REF="367">
building, in who&s;e dungeon his
ma&s;ter was confined, and the appearance
of Vivaldi him&s;elf could &s;carcely have
occa&s;ioned a more &s;udden bur&s;t of joy;
&s;ucceeded by one of grief. &startq;It is the
roof, it is the very roof!&endq; exclaimed
Paulo, vaulting from the ground, and
clapping his hands; &startq;it is the roof, the
roof! O, my ma&s;ter, my ma&s;ter! the
roof, the roof!&endq; He continued alter|nately
to exclaim, &startq;My ma&s;ter! the
roof! my ma&s;ter! the roof!&endq; till his
companion began to fear he was frantic,
while tears &s;treamed down his cheeks,
and every look and ge&s;ture expre&s;&s;ed the
mo&s;t extravagant and whim&s;ical union of
joy and &s;orrow. At length, the ab&s;olute
terror of di&s;covery compelled his compa|nion
to force him from the &s;pot; when,
having lo&s;t &s;ight of the building which
inclo&s;ed Vivaldi, he &s;et off for Naples
with a &s;peed that defied all interruption,
and arrived there in the condition, which
<PB N="367" REF="368">
has been mentioned, having taken no
&s;leep, and &s;carcely any &s;u&s;tenance, &s;ince
he left the Inqui&s;ition. Yet though in this
exhau&s;ted &s;tate, the &s;pirit of his affection
remained unbroken, and, when, on the
following morning, the Marche&s;e quit|ted
Naples, neither his wearine&s;s, nor
the imminent danger, to which this jour|ney
mu&s;t expo&s;e him, could prevent his
attending him to Rome.</P>
<P>The rank of the Marche&s;e, and the
influence he was known to po&s;&s;e&s;s at
the court of Naples, were circum&s;tances
that promi&s;ed to have weight with the
Holy Office, and to procure Vivaldi a
&s;peedy relea&s;e; but yet more than the&s;e,
were the high connections which the
Count di Maro, the friend of the
Marche&s;e, had in the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The applications, however, which were
made to the inqui&s;itors, were not &s;o &s;oon
replied to as the wi&s;hes of the Marche&s;e
had expected, and he had been above a
<PB N="368" REF="369">
fortnight in that city, before he was even
permitted to vi&s;it his &s;on. In this inter|view,
affection predominated on both
&s;ides over all remembrance of the pa&s;t.
The condition of Vivaldi, his &s;aded ap|pearance,
to which the wounds he had
received at Celano, and from which he was
&s;carcely recovered, had contributed; and
his &s;ituation in a melancholy and terrible
pri&s;on, were circum&s;tances that awakened
all the tenderne&s;s of the father; his errors
were forgiven, and the Marche&s;e felt di&s;|po&s;ed
to con&s;ent to all that might re&s;tore him
to happine&s;s, could he but be re&s;tored to
liberty.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, when informed of his mother's
death, &s;hed bitter tears of &s;orrow and re|mor&s;e,
for having occa&s;ioned her &s;o much
unea&s;ine&s;s. The unrea&s;onablene&s;s of her
claims was forgotten, and her faults were
extenuated; happily, indeed, for his
peace, the extent of her criminal de&s;igns
he had never under&s;tood; and when he
<PB N="369" REF="370">
learned that her dying reque&s;t had been
intended to promote his happine&s;s, the
cruel con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having interrupted
her's, occa&s;ioned him &s;evere angui&s;h, and
he was obliged to recollect her former
conduct towards Ellena at San Stefano,
before he could become reconciled to
him&s;elf.</P>

<P>NEAR three weeks had elap&s;ed &s;ince
the Marche&s;e's arrival at Rome, and not
any deci&s;ive an&s;wer was returned by the
Inqui&s;ition to his application, when he
and Vivaldi received at the &s;ame time a
&s;ummons to attend father Schedoni in his
dungeon. To meet the man who had
occasioned &s;o much &s;uffering to his fami|ly,
was extremely painful to the Mar|che&s;e,
but he was not allowed to refu&s;e
the interview; and at the hour appointed
he called at the chamber of Vivaldi;
and, followed by two officials, they pa&s;&s;ed
on together to that of Schedoni.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="372">
While they waited at the door of the
pri&s;on-room, till the numerous bars and
locks were unfa&s;tened, the agitation, which
Vivaldi had &s;uffered, on receiving the
&s;ummons, returned with redoubled force,
now that he was about to behold, once
more, that wretched man, who had an|nounced
him&s;elf to be the parent of El|lena
di Ro&s;alba. The Marche&s;e &s;uffered
emotions of a different nature, and with
his reluctance to &s;ee Schedoni, was min|gled
a degree of curio&s;ity as to the event,
which had occa&s;ioned this &s;ummons.</P>

entered fir&s;t, and the Marche&s;e and
Vivaldi, on following, di&s;vovered the
Confe&s;&s;or lying on a mattre&s;s. He did
not ri&s;e to receive them, but, as he lifted
his head, and bowed it in obei&s;ance, his
countenance, upon which the little light
admitted through the triple grate of his
dungeon gleamed, &s;eemed more than
u&s;ually gha&s;tly; his eyes were hollow,
<PB N="372" REF="373">
and his &s;hrunk features appeared as if
death had already touched them. Vi|valdi,
on perceiving him, groaned and
averted his face; but, &s;oon recovering a
command of him&s;elf, he approached the
mattre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing every ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of re&s;entment towards an enemy,
who was reduced to this deplorable con|dition,
inquired what he had to commu|nicate.</P>
<P>&startq;Where is father Nicola?&endq; &s;aid Sche|doni
to an official, without attending to the
que&s;tion: &startq;I do not &s;ee him here. Is he
gone &s;o &s;oon, and without having heard
the purport of my &s;ummons? Let him be
called.&endq;</P>
<P>The official &s;poke to a centinel, who
immediately left the chamber.</P>
<P>&startq;Who are the&s;e that &s;urround me?&endq;
&s;aid Schedoni. &startq;Who is he that &s;tands
at the foot of the bed?&endq; While he &s;poke
he bent his eyes on Vivaldi, who re&s;ted
<PB N="373" REF="374">
in deep dejection there, and was lo&s;t in
thought, till, arou&s;ed by Schedoni's voice,
he replied,</P>
<P>&startq;It is I, Vincentio di Vivaldi; I obey
your requi&s;ition, and inquire the purpo&s;e
of it?&endq;</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e repeated the demand.
Schedoni appeared to meditate; &s;ome|times
he fixed his eyes upon Vivaldi, for
an in&s;tant, and when he withdrew them,
he &s;eemed to &s;ink into deeper thoughtful|ne&s;s.
As he rai&s;ed them once again, they
a&s;&s;umed a &s;ingular expre&s;&s;ion of wildne&s;s,
and then &s;ettling, as if on vacancy, a
&s;udden glare &s;hot from them, while he
&s;aid&mdash;&startq;Who is he, that glides there in
the du&s;k?&endq;</P>
<P>His eyes were directed beyond Vival|di,
who, on turning, perceived the monk,
father Nicola, pa&s;&s;ing behind him.</P>
<P>&startq;I am here,&endq; &s;aid Nicola: &startq;what do
you require of me?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="375">
&startq;That you will bear te&s;timony to the
truth of what I &s;hall declare,&endq; replied
Schedoni.</P>
<P>Nicola, and an inqui&s;itor who had ac|companied
him, immediately arranged
them&s;elves on one &s;ide of the bed, while
the Marche&s;e &s;tationed him&s;elf on the
other. Vivaldi remained at its foot.</P>
<P>Schedoni, after a pau&s;e, began: &startq;That
which I have to make known relates to
the cabal formerly carried on by him, the
father Nicola, and my&s;elf, again&s;t the
peace of an innocent young woman,
whom, at my in&s;tigation, he has ba&s;ely
traduced.&endq;</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, Nicola attempted to
interrupt the Con&s;effor, but Vivaldi re|&s;trained
him.</P>
<P>&startq;Ellena di Ro&s;alba is known to you?&endq;
continued Schedoni, addre&s;&s;ing the Mar|che&s;e.</P>
<P>Vivaldi's countenance changed at this
abrupt mention of Ellena, but he re|mained
&s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="376">
&startq;I have heard of her,&endq; replied the
Marche&s;e, coldly.</P>
<P>&startq;And you have heard fal&s;ely of her,&endq;
rejoined Schedoni. &startq;Lift your eyes, my
lord Marche&s;e, and &s;ay, do you not re|collect
that face?&endq; pointing to Nicola.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e regarded the monk at|tentively,
&startq;It is a face not ea&s;ily to be
forgotten,&endq; he replied; &startq;I remember to
have &s;een it more than once.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Where have you &s;een him, my
Lord?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In my own palace, at Naples; and
you your&s;elf introduced him to me
there.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I did,&endq; replied Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then, do you now accu&s;e him
of fal&s;hood,&endq; ob&s;erved the Marche&s;e,
&startq;&s;ince you acknowledge your&s;elf to
have been the in&s;tigator of his con|duct?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O heavens!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;this
monk, then, this father Nicola, is, as I
<PB N="376" REF="377">
&s;u&s;pected, the &s;landerer of Ellena di
Ro|&s;alba!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mo&s;t, true,&endq; rejoined Schedoni;
&startq;and it is for the purpo&s;e of vindicate|ing&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And you acknowledge your&s;elf to be
the author of tho&s;e infamous &s;landers!&endq;
pa&s;&s;ionately interrupted Vivaldi;&mdash;&startq;you,
who but lately declared your&s;elf to be
her father!&endq;</P>
<P>In the in&s;tant, that Vivaldi had uttered
this, he became &s;en&s;ible of his indi&s;cre|tion,
for till now he had avoided inform|ing
the Marche&s;e, that Ellena had been
declared the daughter of Schedoni. This
abrupt di&s;clo&s;ure, and at &s;uch a moment,
he immediately, perceived might be fatal
to his hopes, and that the Marche&s;e
would not con&s;ider the promi&s;e he had
given to his dying wife, however &s;olemn,
as binding, under circum&s;tances &s;o pecu|liar
and unfore&s;een as the pre&s;ent. The
a&s;toni&s;hment of the Marche&s;e, upon this
<PB N="377" REF="378">
di&s;covery, cannot ea&s;ily he imagined;
he looked at his &s;on for an explanation of
what he had heard, and then with in|crca&s;ed
dete&s;tation at the Confe&s;&s;or; but
Vivaldi was not in a &s;tate of mind to
give any explanation at this moment,
and he reque&s;ted his father to &s;u&s;pend
even his conjectures till he could conver&s;e
with him alone.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e de&s;i&s;ted for the pre&s;ent
from further inquiry, but it was obvious
that his opinion and his re&s;olution, re|&s;peting
the marriage of Vivaldi, was al|ready
formed.</P>
<P>&startq;You, then, are the author of tho&s;e
&s;landers!&endq; repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Hear me!&endq; cried Schedoni, in a
voice which the &s;trength of his &s;pirit
contending with the feeblene&s;s of his
condition, rendered hollow and terrible
&mdash;&startq;Hear me!&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topped, unable to recover im|mediately
from the effect of the exer|tion
<PB N="378" REF="379">
he had made. At length, he re|&s;umed,</P>
<P>&startq;I have declared, and I continue to
declare, that Ellena di Ro&s;alba, as &s;he
has been named for the purpo&s;e, I, con|jecture,
of concealing her from an un|worthy
father, is my daughter!&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi groaned in the exce&s;s of his
de&s;pair, but made no further attempt to
interrupt Schedoni. The Marche&s;e was
not equally pa&s;&s;ive. &startq;And was it to li&s;|ten
to a vindication of your daughter,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;that have been &s;ummoned
hither? But let this Signora Ro&s;alba, be
who &s;he may, of what importance can it
be to me whether &s;he is innocent or other|wi&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, with the utmo&s;t difficulty,
forbore to expre&s;s the feelings, which
this &s;entence excited. It appeared to re|call
all the &s;pirit of Schedoni. &startq;She is
the daughter of a noble hou&s;e,&endq; &s;aid the
Confe&s;&s;or, haughtily, while he half rai&s;ed
<PB N="379" REF="380">
him&s;elf from his mattre&s;s. &startq;In me you
behold the la&s;t of the Counts di Bru|no.&endq;</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Schedoni proceeded; &startq;I call upon
you, Nicola di Zampari, who have de|clared
your&s;elf, on a late occa&s;ion, &s;o
&s;trenuous for ju&s;tice, I call upon you now
to do ju&s;tice in this in&s;tance, and to ac|knowledge,
before tne&s;e witne&s;&s;es, that
Ellena Ro&s;alba is innocent of every cir|cum&s;tance
of mi&s;conduct, which you have
formerly related to the Marche&s;e di Vi|valid!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Villain! do you he&s;itate,&endq; &s;aid Vi|valdi
to Nicola, &startq;to retract the cruel
&s;landers which you have thrown upon her
name, and which have been the means of
de&s;troying her peace, perhaps fop ever?
Do you per&s;i&s;t&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e interrupted his &s;on:&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Let me put an end to the difficulty, by
concluding the interview; I perceive
that my pre&s;ence has been required
<PB N="380" REF="381">
for a purpo&s;e that does not concern
me.&endq;</P>
<P>Before the Confe&s;&s;or could reply, the
Marche&s;e had turned from him to quit
the chamber; but the vehemence of Vi|valdi's
di&s;tre&s;s prevailed with him to
pau&s;e, and thus allowed him to under|&s;tand
from Schedoni, that the ju&s;tification,
of the innocent Ellena, though it had
been mentioned fir&s;t, as being the object neare&s;t
to his heart, was not the only one
that had urged him to require this meet|ing.</P>
<P>&startq;If you con&s;ent,&endq; added Schedoni,
&startq;to li&s;ten to the vindication of my child,
you &s;hall afterwards perceive, Signor,
that I, fallen though I am, have &s;till been
de&s;irous of counteracting, as far as re|mains
for me, the evil I have occasioned.
You &s;hall acknowledge, that what I then
make known is of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence
to the repo&s;e of the Marche&s;e di
Vivaldi, high in influence, and haughty
in pro&s;perity as he now appears.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="382">
The latter part of this a&s;&s;urance threat|ened
to overcome the effect of the fir&s;t;
the pride of the Marche&s;e &s;welled high;
he took &s;ome &s;teps towards the door, but
then &s;topped, and, conjecturing that the
&s;ubject, to which Schedoni alluded, con|cerned
the liberation of his &s;on, he con|&s;ented
to attend to what Nicola &s;hould
di&s;clo&s;e.</P>
<P>This monk, meanwhile, had been ba|lancing
the nece&s;&s;ity for acknowledging
him&s;elf a &s;landerer, again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of avoiding it; and it was the re&s;o|lute
manner of Vivaldi, who appeared
to have no doubt as to his guilt in this
in&s;tance, that made him apprehend the
con&s;equence of per&s;i&s;ting in fal&s;hood,
not either remor&s;e of con&s;cience, or the
appeal of Schedoni. He ackcnowledged
then, after con&s;iderable circumlocution,
in which he contrived to de&s;end him&s;elf,
by throwing all the odium of the original
de&s;ign upon the Confe&s;&s;or that he had
<PB N="382" REF="383">
been prevailed upon by his arts to impo&s;e
on the credulity of the Marche&s;e, re&s;pect|ing
the conduct of Ellena di Ro&s;alba.
This avowal was made upon oath, and
Schedoni, by the que&s;tions he put to him,
was careful it &s;hould be &s;o full and cir|cum&s;tantial
that even the mo&s;t prejudiced
hearer mu&s;t have been convinced of its
truth; while the mo&s;t unfeeling mu&s;t
have yielded for once to indignation
again&s;t the a&s;per&s;er, and pity of the
a&s;per&s;ed. Its effect upon the pre&s;ent au|ditors
was various. The Marche&s;e had
li&s;tened to the whole explanation with an
unmoved countenance, but with profound
attention. Vivaldi had remained in a
fixed attitude, with eyes bent on father
Nicola, in &s;uch eager and &s;tern regard,
as &s;eemed to &s;earch into his very &s;oul;
and, when the monk concluded, a &s;mile
of triumphant joy lighted up his features,
as he looked upon the Marche&s;e, and
claimed acknowledgment of his con|viction,
<PB N="383" REF="384">
that Ellena had been calumniated.
The cold glance, which the Marche&s;e
returned, &s;truck the impa&s;&s;ioned and ge|nerous
Vivaldi to the heart, who perceived
that he was not only totally indifferent as
to the inju&s;tice, which an innocent and
helple&s;s young woman had &s;uffered, but
fancied that he was unwilling to admit the
truth, which his judgment would no
longer allow him to reject.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, appeared almo&s;t
to writhe under the agony, which his mind
inflicted upon him, and it was only by
&s;trong effort, that he &s;u&s;tained his &s;pirit &s;o
far as to go through with the interroga|tions
he had judged it nece&s;&s;ary to put
to Nicola. When the &s;ubject was fini&s;h|ed,
he &s;unk back on his pillow, and, clo&s;|ing
his eyes, a hue &s;o pallid, &s;ucceeded by
one &s;o livid, over&s;pread his features, that
Vivaldi for an in&s;tant believed he was dy|ing;
and in this &s;uppo&s;ition he was not
&s;ingular for even an official was touched
<PB N="384" REF="385">
with the Confe&s;&s;or's condition, and had
advanced to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, when he unclo&s;ed
his eyes, and &s;eemed to revive.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e, without muting any
comment upon the avowal of father Ni|cola,
demanded, on its conclu&s;ion, the
di&s;clo&s;ure, which Schedoni had a&s;&s;erted to
be intimately connected with his peace;
and the latter now inquired of a per&s;on|near
him, whether a &s;ecretary bf the In|qui&s;ition
was in the chamber, who he had
reque&s;ted might attend, to take a formal
deposition of what he &s;hould declare.
He was an&s;wered, that &s;uch an one was
already in waiting. He then a&s;ked, what
other per&s;ons were in the room, adding,
that he &s;hould require inqui&s;itorial wit|ne&s;&s;es
to his depo&s;ition; and was an&s;wer|ed,
that an inqui&s;itor and two officials
were pre&s;ent, and that their evidence was
more than &s;ufficient for his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A lamp was then called for by the &s;e|cretary;
but, as that could not imme|diately
<PB N="385" REF="386">
be procured, the torch of one of
the centinels, who watched in the dark
avenue without, was brought in its &s;tead,
and this di&s;covered to Schedoni the va|rious
figures a&s;&s;embled in his du&s;ky cham|ber,
and to them the emaciated form and
gha&s;tly vi&s;age of the Confe&s;&s;or. As Vi|valdi
now beheld him by the &s;tronger
light of the torch, he again fancied that
death was in his a&s;pect.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on was now ready for the
declaration of Schedoni; but he him&s;elf
&s;eemed not fully prepared. He remained
for &s;ome moments reclining on his pillow
in &s;ilence, with his eyes &s;hut, while the
changes in his features indicated the &s;trong
emotion of his mind. Then, as if by a
violent effort, he half rai&s;ed him&s;elf, and
made an ample confe&s;&s;ion of the arts he
had practi&s;ed again&s;t Vivaldi. He de|clared
him&s;elf to be the anonymous ac|cu&s;er,
who had cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted
by the Holy Office, and that the charge
<PB N="386" REF="387">
of here&s;y, which he had brought again&s;t
him, was fal&s;e and malicious.</P>
<P>At the moment when Vivaldi received
this confirmation of his &s;u&s;picions, as to
the identity of his accu&s;er, he di&s;covered
more fully that the charge was not what
had been &s;tated to him at the chapel of
San Seba&s;tian, in which Ellena was im|plicated;
and he demanded an explana|tion
of this circum&s;tance. Schedoni ac|knowledged,
that the per&s;ons, who had
there arre&s;ted him, were not officers of the
Inqui&s;ition, and that the in&s;trument of
arre&s;t, containing the charge of elope|ment
with a nun, was forged by him&s;elf,
for the purpo&s;e of empowering the ruf|fians
to carry off Ellena, without oppo&s;i|tion
from the inhabitants of the convent,
in which the was then lodged.</P>
<P>To Vivaldi's inquiry, why it had been
thought nece&s;&s;ary to employ &s;tratagem in
the removal of Ellena, &s;ince, if Schedoni
had only claimed her for his daughter, he
<PB N="387" REF="388">
might have removed her without any, the
Confe&s;&s;or replied, that he was then igno|rant
of the relation&s;hip which exi&s;ted be|tween
them. Bu to the further inquiries,
with what de&s;ign, and whither Ellena
had been removed, and the means by
which he had di&s;covered her to be his
daughter, Schedoni was &s;ilent; and he
&s;unk back, overwhelmed by the recollect|tions
they awakened.</P>
<P>The depo&s;itions of Schedoni having
been taken down by the &s;ecretary, were
formally &s;igned by the inqui&s;itor and the
officials pre&s;ent; and Vivaldi thus &s;aw his
innocence vindicated by the very man who
had thrown him among the perils of the
Inquisition. But the near pro&s;pect of
relea&s;e now before him failed to affect
him with joy, while he understood that
Ellena was the daughter of Schedoni, the
child of a murderer, whom he him&s;elf
had been in &s;ome degree in&s;trumental in
bringing to a dreadful and ignominious
<PB N="388" REF="389">
death. Still, however, willing to hope,
that Schedoni had not &s;poken the truth
concerning his relation&s;hip to Ellena, he
claimed, in con&s;ideration of the affection
he had &s;o long cheri&s;hed for her, a full
explanation of the circum&s;tances connect|ed
with the di&s;covery of her family.</P>
<P>At this public avowal of his attach|ment,
a haughty impatience appeared on
the countenance of the Marche&s;e, who
forbade him to make further inquiry on
the &s;ubject, and was immediately retiring
from the chamber.</P>
<P>&startq;My pre&s;ence is no longer nece&s;&s;ary,&endq;
he added: &startq;the pri&s;oner has concluded
the only detail which I could be intere&s;ted
to hear from him; and, in con&s;ideration of
the confe&s;&s;ion he has made as to the in|nocence
of my &s;on, I pardon him the &s;uf|fering,
which his fal&s;e charge has occa|&s;ioned
to me and my family. The paper
containing his depo&s;tions is given to your
re&s;pon&s;ibility, holy father,&endq; addre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="389" REF="390">
the inqui&s;itor; &startq;and you are required
to lay it upon the table of the Holy Of|fice,
that the innocence of Vincentio di
Vivaldi may appear, and that he may be
relea&s;ed from the&s;e pri&s;ons without further
delay. But fir&s;t, I demand a copy of
tho&s;e declarations, and that the copy al&s;o
&s;hall be &s;igned by the pre&s;ent witne&s;&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;ecretary was now bidden to copy
them, and, while the Marche&s;e waited to
receive the paper, (for he would not leave
the chamber till he had &s;ecured it) Vi|valdi
was urging his claim for an expla|nation
re&s;pecting the family of Ellena,
with unconquerable per&s;everance. Sche|doni,
no longer permitted to eyade the
inquiry, could not, however, give a cir|cum&s;tantial
explanation, without partly
di&s;clo&s;ing, al&s;o, the fatal de&s;igns which
had been meditated by him and the late
Marche&s;a di Vivaldi, of who&s;e death he
was ignorant; he related, therefore, lit|tle
more re&s;pecting Ellens than that a
<PB N="390" REF="391">
portrait, which &s;he wore as being her fa|ther's,
had fir&s;t led to the di&s;covery of her
family.</P>
<P>While the Confe&s;&s;or had been giving
this brief explanation, Nicola, who was
&s;omewhat withdrawn from the circle, &s;tood
gazing at him with the malignity of a
demon. His glowing eyes ju&s;t appeared
under the edge of his cowl, while, rolled
up in his dark drapery, the lower features
of his face were muffled; but the inter|mediate
part of his countenance, recei|ving
the full glare of the torch, di&s;played
all its &s;peaking and terrific lines. Vivaldi,
as his eye glanced upon him, &s;aw again
the very monk of Paluzzi, and he thought
he beheld al&s;o a man capable of the very
crimes of which he had accu&s;ed Schedoni.
At this in&s;tant, he remembered the dread|ful
garment that had been di&s;covered in a
dungeon of the fortre&s;s; and, yet more,
he remembered the extraordinary circum|&s;tances
attending the death of Bianchi,
<PB N="391" REF="392">
together with the immediate knowledge
which the monk had di&s;played of that
event. Vivaldi's &s;u&s;picions re&s;pecting the
cau&s;e of her death being thus revived, he
determined to obtain, if po&s;&s;ible, either a re|lief
from, or a confirmation of them; and
he &s;olemnly called upon Schedoni, who,
ready condemned to die, had no longer
any thing to fear from a di&s;clo&s;ure of the
truth, whatever it might be, to declare
all that he knew on the &s;ubject. As he
did &s;o, he looked at Nicola, to ob&s;erve
the effect of this demand, who&s;e counte|nance
was, however, &s;o much &s;hrouded,
that little of its expre&s;&s;ion could be &s;een;
but Vivaldi remarked, that, while he had
&s;poken, the monk drew his garment clo&s;er
over the lower part of his face, and that
he had immediately turned his eyes from
him upon the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>With mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations, Sche|doni
declared him&s;elf to be both innocent
and ignorant of the cau&s;e of Bianchi's
death.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="393">
Vivaldi then demanded by what means
his agent, Nicola, had obtained &s;uch im|mediate
information, as the warning he
had delivered at Paluzzi proved him to
have, of an event, in which it appeared
that he could be &s;o little intere&s;ted; and
why that warning had been given.</P>
<P>Nicola did not attempt to anticipate the
reply of Schedoni, who, after a momen|tary
&s;ilence, &s;aid, &startq;That warning, young
man, was given to deter you from vi&s;it|ing
Altieri, as was every circum&s;tance of
advice or intelligence, which you received
beneath the arch of Paluzzi.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Father,&endq; replied Vivaldi, &startq;you have
never loved, or you would have &s;pared your|&s;elf
the practice of artifices &s;o ineffectual
to mi&s;lead or to conquer a lover. Did you
believe that an anonymous advi&s;er could
have more influence with me than my
affection, or that I could could be terri|fied
by &s;uch &s;tratagems into a renuncia|tion
of its object?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="394">
&startq;I believed,&endq; rejoined the Confe&s;&s;or,
&startq;that the di&s;intere&s;ted advice of a &s;tran|ger
might have &s;ome weight with you;
but I tru&s;ted more to the impre&s;&s;ion of
awe, which the conduct and &s;eeming fore-knowledge
of that &s;tranger were adapted
to in&s;pire in a mind like your's; and I
thus endeavoured to avail my&s;elf of your
prevailing weakne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And, what do you term my prevail|ing
weakne&s;s,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>A &s;u&s;ceptibility which renders you
e&s;pecially liable to &s;uper&s;tition,&endq; replied
Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;What! does a monk, call &s;uper&s;tition
a weakne&s;s!&endq; rejoined Vivaldi. &startq;But
grant he does, on what occa&s;ion have I
betrayed &s;uch weakne&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have you forgotten a conver&s;ation
which It once held with you on invi&s;ible
&s;pirits?&endq; &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>As he a&s;ked this, Vivaldi was &s;truck
with the tone of his voice; he thought it
<PB N="394" REF="395">
was different from what he had remem|bered
ever to have heard from him; and
he looked at Schedoni more intently, that
he might be certain it was he who had
&s;poken. The Confe&s;&s;or's eyes were fixed
upon him, and he repeated &s;lowly in the
&s;ame tone, &startq;Have you forgotten?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have not forgotten the conver&s;ation
to which you allude,&endq; replied Vivaldi,
&startq;and I do not recollect that I then di&s;|clo&s;ed
any opinion that may ju&s;tify your
a&s;&s;ertion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The opinions you avowed were ra|tional,&endq;
&s;aid Schedoni, &startq;but the ardour
of your imagination was apparent, and
what ardent imagination ever was con|tented
to tru&s;t to plain rea&s;oning, or to
the evidence of the &s;en&s;es? It may not
willingly confine it&s;elf to the dull truths
of this earth, but, eager to expand its
faculties, to fill its capacity, and to expe|rience
its own peculiar delights, &s;oars
after new wonders into a world of its
own!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="396">
Vivaldi blu&s;hed at this reproof, now
con&s;cious of its ju&s;tne&s;s; and was &s;urpri&s;ed
that Schedoni &s;hould &s;o well have under|&s;tood
the nature of his mind, while he
him&s;elf, with whom conjecture had never
a&s;&s;umed the &s;tability of opinion, on the
&s;ubject to which the Confe&s;&s;or alluded,
had been ignorant even of its propen&s;i|ties.</P>
<P>&startq;I acknowledge the truth of your re|mark,&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;as far as it con|cerns
my&s;elf. I have, however, inquiries
to make on a point le&s;s ab&s;tracted, and
towards explaining which the evidence
of my &s;en&s;es them&s;elves have done little.
To whom belonged the bloody garments
I found in the dungeon of Paluzzi, and
what became of the per&s;on to whom they
had pertained.?&endq;</P>
<P>Con&s;ternation appeared for an in&s;tant
on the features of Schedoni. &startq;What, gar|ments?&endq;
&s;aid he.</P>
<P>&startq;They appeared to be tho&s;e of a per|&s;on
who had died by violence,&endq; replied
<PB N="396" REF="397">
valdi, &startq;and they were di&s;covered in a
place frequented by your avowed agent,
Nicola, the monk.&endq;</P>
<P>As he concluded the &s;entence, Vivaldi
looked at Nicola, upon whom the atten|tion
of every per&s;on pre&s;ent was now di|rected.</P>
<P>&startq;They were my own,&endq; &s;aid this
monk.</P>
<P>&startq;Your own! and in that condition!&endq;
exclaimed Vivaldi. &startq;They were covered
with gore!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They were my own,&endq; repeated Ni|cola.
&startq;For their condition, I have to
thank you,&mdash;the wound your pi&s;tol gave
me occa&s;ioned it.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi was a&s;toni&s;hed by this apparent
&s;ubterfuge. &startq;I had no pi&s;tol,&endq; he re|joined,
&startq;my &s;word was my only wea|pon!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pau&s;e a moment,&endq; &s;aid the monk.</P>
<P>&startq;I repeat that I had no fire-arms,&endq;
replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="398">
&startq;I appeal to father Schedoni,&endq; rejoned
Nicola, &startq;whether I was not wounded by
a pi&s;tol &s;hot.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To me you have no longer any right
of appeal,&endq; &s;aid Schedoni. &startq;Why &s;hould
I &s;ave you from &s;u&s;picions, that may bring
you to a &s;tate like this, to which you have
reduced me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your crimes have reduced you to it,&endq;
replied Nicola, &startq;I have only done my
duty, and that which another per&s;on
could have effected without my aid&mdash;the
prie&s;t to whom Spalatro made his la&s;t
confe&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is, however, a duty of &s;uch a
kind,&endq; ob&s;erved Vivaldi, &startq;as I would not
willingly have upon my con&s;cience. You
have betrayed the life of your former
friend, and have compelled me to a&s;&s;i&s;t in
the de&s;truction of a fellow being.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You, like me, have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to de|&s;troy
a de&s;troyer,&endq; replied the monk.
&startq;He has taken life, and de&s;erves, there|fore,
<PB N="398" REF="399">
to lo&s;e it. If, however, it will af|ford
you con&s;olation to know that you
have not materially a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;truc|tion,
I will hereafter give you proof for
this a&s;&s;urance. There were other means
of &s;hewing that Schedoni was the Count
di Bruno, than the testimony of An&s;aldo,
though I was ignorant of them when I
bade you &s;ummon the penitentiary.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you had &s;ooner avowed this,&endq; &s;aid
Vivaldi, the a&s;&s;ertion would have been
more plau&s;ible. Now, I can only under|&s;tand
that it is de&s;igned to win my &s;ilence,
and prevent my retorting upon you your
own maxim&mdash;that he who has taken the
life of another, de&s;erves to lo&s;e his own.&mdash;
To whom did tho&s;e bloody garments be|long?&endq;.</P>
<P>&startq;To my&s;elf, I repeat,&endq; replied Ni|cola,
&startq;Shedoni can bear te&s;timony that
I received at Paluzzi a pi&s;tol wound.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Impo&s;&s;ible,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;I was
armed only with my &s;word!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="400">
&startq;You had a companion,&endq; ob&s;erved the
monk, &startq;had hot he fire-arms?&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after a momentary considera|tion,
recollected that Paulo had pi&s;tols,
and that he had fired one beneath the
arch of Paluzzi; on the fir&s;t alarm occa|&s;ioned
by the &s;tranger's Voice. He im|mediately
acknowledged the recollection,
&startq;But I heard no groan, no &s;ymptom of
di&s;tre&s;s!&endq; he added. &startq;Be&s;ides, the gar|ments
were at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from
the &s;pot where the pi&s;tol was fired! How
could a per&s;on, &s;o &s;everely wounded as
tho&s;e garments indicated, have &s;ilently
withdrawn to a remote dungeon, or, hav|ing
done &s;o, is it probable he would have
thrown a&s;ide his dre&s;s!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All that is neverthele&s;s true,&endq; re|plied
Nicola. &startq;My re&s;olution enabled me
to &s;tifle the expre&s;&s;ion of my angui&s;h; I
withdrew; to the interior of the ruin, to
e&s;cape from you, but you pur&s;ued me even
to the dungeon, where I threw off my di&s;coloured
<PB N="400" REF="401">
coloured ve&s;tments, in which I dared not
return to my convent, and departed by a
way which all your ingenuity failed to di&s;|cover.
The people who were already in the
fort, for the purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;ting to confine
you and your &s;ervant during the night on
which Signora Ro&s;alba was taken from
Altieri, procured me another habit, and
relief for my wound. But, though I was
un&s;een by you during the night, I was
not entirely unheard, for my groans
reached you more than once from an ad|joining
chamber, and my companions
were entertained with the alarm which
your &s;ervant te&s;tified.&mdash;Are you now con|vinced?&endq;</P>
<P>The groans were clearly remembered
by Vivaldi, and many other circum&s;tances
of Nicola's narration accorded &s;o well
with others, which he recollected to have
occurred on the night alluded to, that he
had no longer a doubt of its veracity.
The &s;uddenne&s;s of Bianchi's death, how|ever,
<PB N="401" REF="402">
still occa&s;ioned him &s;ufpicions as to
its cau&s;e; yet Schedoni had declared not
only that he was innocent, but ignorant
of this, cau&s;e, which it appeared from his
unwillingne&s;s to give te&s;timony in favour
of his agent, he would not have affirmed,
had he been con&s;cious that the monk was
in any degree guilty in this in&s;tance. That
Nicola could, have no inducement for at|tempting
the life of Bianchi other than a
reward offered him by Schedoni, was
clear; and Vivaldi;, after more fully con|&s;idering
the&s;e circum&s;tances, became con|vinced
that her death was in con&s;equence
of &s;ome incident of natural decay.</P>
<P>While this conver&s;ation was pa&s;&s;ing,
the Marche&s;e, impatient to put a conclu|&s;ion
to it, and to leave the chamber, re|peatedly
urged the &s;ecretary to di&s;patch;
and, while he now earne&s;tly renewed his
reque&s;t, another voice an&s;wered for the
&s;ecretary, that he had nearly concluded.
Vivaldi thought that he had heard the
<PB N="402" REF="403">
voice on &s;ome former occa&s;ion, and on
turning his eyes upon the per&s;on who had
&s;poken, discovered the &s;tranger to be the
&s;ame who had fir&s;t vi&s;ited him in pri&s;on.
Perceiving by his dre&s;s, that he was an
officer, of the Inqui&s;ition; Vivaldi now
under&s;tood too well the purport of his
former vi&s;it, and that he had come with a
de&s;ign to betray him by affected &s;ympathy
into a confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ome heretical opinions.
Similar in&s;tances of treachery Vivaldi had
heard were frequently practi&s;ed upon ac|cu&s;ed
per&s;ons, but he had never fully be|lieved
&s;uch cruelty po&s;&s;ible till now, that
it had been attempted towards him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The vi&s;it of this per&s;on bringing to his
recollection the &s;ub&s;equent one he had
received from Nicola, Vivaldi inquired
whether the centinels had really admitted
him to his cell, or he had entered it by
other means; a que&s;tion to which the
monk was &s;ilent, but the &s;mile on his fea|tures,
if &s;o &s;trange an expre&s;&s;ion de&s;erved
<PB N="403" REF="404">
to be called a &s;mile, &s;eemed to reply, &startq;Do
you believe that I, a Servant of the In|qui&s;ition,
will betray its &s;ecrets?&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, however, urged the inquiry,
for he wi&s;hed to know whether the guard,
who appeared to be faithful to their office,
had e&s;caped the puni&s;hment that was
threatened.</P>
<P>&startq;They were hone&s;t,&endq; replied Nicola,
&startq;&s;eek no further.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are the tribunal convinced of their
integrity?&endq;</P>
<P>Nicola &s;miled again in deri&s;ion, and
replied, &startq;They never doubted it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;Why were
the&s;e men put under arre&s;t, if their faith|fulne&s;s
was not even &s;u&s;pected?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Be &s;atisfied with the knowledge,
which experience has given you of the
&s;ecrets of the Inqui&s;ition,&endq; replied Nicola
&s;olemnly, &startq;&s;eek to know no more!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It has terrible &s;ecrets!&endq; &s;aid Schedoni,
who had been long &s;ilent. &startq;Know,
<PB N="404" REF="405">
young man, that almo&s;t every cell of every
pri&s;oner has a concealed entrance, by
which the mini&s;ters of death may pa&s;s un|noticed
to their victims. This Nicola is
now one of tho&s;e dreadful &s;ummoners, and
is acquainted with all the &s;ecret avenues,
that lead to murder.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;hrunk from Nicola in horror,
and Schedoni pau&s;ed; but while he had
&s;poken, Vivaldi had again noticed the
extraordinary change in his voice, and
&s;huddered at its &s;ound no le&s;s than at the
information it had given. Nicola was
&s;ilent; but his terrible eyes were fixed in
vengeance on Schedoni.</P>
<P>&startq;His office has been &s;hort,&endq; re&s;umed
the Confe&s;&s;or, turning his heavy eyes
upon Nicola, &startq;and his ta&s;k is almo&s;t
done!&endq; As he pronounced the la&s;t words
his voice faltered, but they were heard by,
the monk, who drawing nearer to the bed,
demanded an explanation of them. A
gha&s;tly &s;mile triumphed in the features of
<PB N="405" REF="406">
Schedoni; &startq;Fear not but that an expla|nation
will come full &s;oon,&endq; &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Nicola, fixed him&s;elf before the Con|fe&s;&s;or,
and bent his brows upon him as if
he would have &s;earched into his very &s;oul.
When Vivaldi again looked at Schedoni,
he was &s;hocked on ob&s;erving the &s;udden
alteration in his countenance, yet &s;till a
faint &s;mile of triumph lingered there. But,
while Vivaldi gazed, the features &s;uddenly
became agitated; in the next in&s;tant his
whole frame was convul&s;ed, and, heavy
groans laboured from his brea&s;t. Schedoni
was now evidently dying.</P>
<P>The horror of Vivaldi, and of the Mar|che&s;e,
who endeavoured to leave the
chamber, was equalled only by the gene|ral
confu&s;ion that reigned there; every
per&s;on pre&s;ent &s;eemed to feel at lea&s;t a
momentary compa&s;&s;ion, except Nicola,
who &s;tood unmoved be&s;ide Schedoni, and
looked &s;tedfa&s;tly upon his pangs, while a
&s;mile of deri&s;ion marked his countenance.
As Vivaldi ob&s;erved, with dete&s;tation,
<PB N="406" REF="407">
this expre&s;&s;ion, a flight &s;pa&s;m darted over
Nicola's face, and his mu&s;cles al&s;o &s;eemed
to labour with &s;udden contraction; but
the affection was tran&s;ient, and vani&s;hed
as abruptly as it had appeared. The monk,
however, turned from the mi&s;erable &s;pec|tacle
before him, and as he turned he
caught involuntarily at the arm of a per&s;on
near him, and leaned on his &s;houlder for
&s;upport. His manner appeared to betray
that he had not been permitted to triumph
in the &s;ufferings of his enemy, without
participating at lea&s;t in their horror.</P>
<P>Schedoni's &s;truggles now began to
abate, and in a &s;hort time he lay motion|le&s;s.
When he unclo&s;ed his eyes, death
was in them. He was yet nearly in&s;en|&s;ible;
but presently a faint gleam of re|collection
&s;hot from them, and gradually
lighting them up, the character of his
&s;oul appeared there; the expre&s;&s;ion was
indeed feeble, but it was true. He moved
his lips as if he would have &s;poken, and
looked languidly round the chamber,
<PB N="407" REF="408">
&s;eemingly in &s;earch of &s;ome per&s;on. At
length, he uttered a found, but he had not
yet &s;ufficient command of his mu&s;cles, to
modulate that &s;ound into a word, till by
repeated efforts the name of Nicola be|came
intelligible. At the call, the monk
rai&s;ed his head from the &s;houlder of the
per&s;on on whom he had reelined, and
turning round, Schedoni, as was evident
from, the &s;udden change of expre&s;&s;ion in
his countenance, di&s;covered him; his eyes,
as they &s;ettled on Nicola &s;eemed to recol|lect
all their wonted fire, and the malig|nant
triumph, lately &s;o prevalent in his
phy&s;iognomy, again appeared as in the
next moment, he pointed to him. His
glance &s;eemed &s;uddenly impowered with
the de&s;tructive fa&s;cination attributed to
that of the ba&s;ili&s;k, for while it now met
Nicola's, that monk &s;eemed as if trans|fixed
to the &s;pot, and unable to withdraw
his eyes from the glare of Schedoni's; in
their expre&s;&s;ion he read the dreadful &s;en|tence
of his fate, the triumph of revenge
<PB N="408" REF="409">
and cunning. Struck with this terrible con|viction
a pallid hue over&s;pread his face; at
the &s;ame time an involuntary motion con|vul&s;ed
his features, cold trembling &s;eized
upon his frame, and, uttering a deep groan,
he fell back, and was caught in the arms
of the people near him. At the in&s;tant of
his fall, Schedoni uttered a found, &s;o
&s;trange and horrible, &s;o convul&s;ed, yet &s;o
loud, &s;o exulting, yet &s;o unlike any hu|man
voice, that every per&s;on in the cham|ber,
except tho&s;e who were a&s;&s;i&s;ting
Nicola, &s;truck with irre&s;i&s;tible terror, en|deavoured
to make their way out of it.
This, however, was impracticable, for
the door was fa&s;tened, until a phy&s;ician,
who had been &s;ent for, &s;hould arrive, and
&s;ome investigation could be made into this
my&s;terious affair. The con&s;ternation of
the Marche&s;e and of Vivaldi, compelled
to witne&s;s this &s;cene of horror, cannot
ea&s;ily be imagined.</P>
<P>Schedoni, having uttered that demo|niacal
found of exultation, was not per|mitted
<PB N="409" REF="410">
to repeat it, for the pangs he had
lately &s;uffered returned upon him, and
he was again in &s;trong convul&s;ions, when
the phy&s;ician entered the chamber. The
moment he beheld Schedoni, he declared
him to be poi&s;oned; and he pronounced
a &s;imilar opinion on father Nicola; affirm|ing,
al&s;o, that the drug, as appeared from
the violence of the effect, was of too &s;ubtle
and inveterate a nature to allow of anti|dote.
He was, however, willing to adm|ini&s;ter
the medicine u&s;ual in &s;uch
ca&s;es.</P>
<P>While he was giving orders to an at|tendant,
with re&s;pect to this, the violence
of Schedoni's convul&s;ions once more re|laxed;
but Nicola appeared in the la&s;t
extremity. His &s;ufferings were ince&s;&s;ant,
his &s;en&s;es never for a moment returned,
and he expired, before the medicine,
which had been &s;ent for, could be brought.
When it came, however, it was admini|&s;tered
with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s to Schedoni, who
<PB N="410" REF="411">
recovered not only his recollection, but
his voice; and the fir&s;t word he uttered
was, as formerly, the name of Nicola.</P>
<P>&startq;Does he live?&endq; added the Confe&s;&s;or
with the utmo&s;t difficulty, and after a long
pau&s;e. The per&s;ons around him were
&s;ilent, but the truth, which this &s;ilence
indicated, &s;eemed to revive him.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;tor, who had attended, per|ceiving
that Schedoni had recovered the
u&s;e of his intellects, now judged it pru|dent
to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions relative to his
pre&s;ent condition, and to the cau&s;e of
Nicola's death.</P>
<P>&startq;Poi&s;on,&endq; replied Schedoni readily.</P>
<P>&startq;By whom admini&s;tered?&endq; &s;aid the
inqui&s;itor, &startq;con&s;ider that, while you an|&s;wer,
you are on your death-bed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have no wi&s;h to conceal the truth,&endq;
rejoined Schedoni, &startq;nor the &s;atisfaction&endq;
&mdash;he was obliged to pau&s;e, but pre&s;ently
added, &startq;I have destroyed him, who
would have destroyed me, and&mdash;and I
have e&s;caped an ignominious death.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="412">
He pau&s;ed again; it was with difficulty
that he had &s;aid thus much, and he was now
overcome by the exertion he had made.
The &s;ecretary, who had not been permitted
to leave the chamber, was ordered to note
Schedoni's words.</P>
<P>&startq;You avow then,&endq; continued the in|qui&s;itor,
&startq;that the poi&s;on was admini|&s;tered,
both in the ca&s;e of father Nicola
and in your own, by your&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni could not immediately reply;
but when he did, he &s;aid, &startq;I avow it.&endq;</P>
<P>He was a&s;ked by what means he had
contrived to procure the poi&s;on, and was
bidden to name his accomplice.</P>
<P>&startq;I had no accomplice,&endq; replied Sche|doni.</P>
<P>&startq;How did you procure the poi&s;on, then?&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni, &s;lowly and with difficulty,
replied, &startq;It was concealed in my ve&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Con&s;ider that you are dying,&endq; &s;aid
the inqui&s;itor, &startq;and confe&s;s the truth.
<PB N="412" REF="413">
We cannot believe what you have la&s;t
a&s;&s;erted. It is improbable that you &s;hould
have had an opportunity of providing
your&s;elf with poi&s;on after your arre&s;t, and
equally improbable that you &s;hould have
thought &s;uch provi&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary before
that period. Confe&s;s who is your ac|complice.&endq;</P>
<P>This accu&s;ation of fal&s;hood recalled
the &s;pirit of Schedoni, which, contending
with, and conquering, for a moment, cor|poreal
&s;uffering, he &s;aid in a firmer tone,
&startq;It was the poi&s;on, in which I dip my
poniard, the better to defend me.&endq;</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor &s;miled in contempt of
this explanation, and Schedoni, ob&s;erving
him, de&s;ired a particular part of his ve&s;t
might be examined, where would be
&s;ound &s;ome remains of the drug concealed
as he had affirmed. He was indulged in
his reque&s;t, and the poi&s;on was di&s;covered
within a broad hem of his garment.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="414">
Still it was inconceivable how he had
contrived to admini&s;ter it to Nicola, who,
though he had been for &s;ome time alone
with him on this day, would &s;carcely have
&s;o far confided in an enemy, as to have
accepted any &s;ceming &s;u&s;tenance that
might have been offered by him. The
inqui&s;itor, &s;till anxious to di&s;cover an
accomplice, a&s;ked Schedoni who had
a&s;&s;i&s;ted to admini&s;ter the drug to Nicola,
but the Confe&s;&s;or was no longer in a
condition to reply. Life was now &s;ink|ing
apace; the gleam of &s;pirit and of
character that had returned to his eyes,
was departed, and left them haggard and
fixed; and pre&s;ently a livid cor&s;e was all
that remained of the once terrible Sche|doni!</P>
<P>While this awful event had been ac|compli&s;hing,
the Marche&s;e, &s;uffering
under the utmo&s;t perturbation, had
withdrawn to the di&s;tant grate of the
dungeon, where he conver&s;ed with an
<PB N="414" REF="415">
official as to what might be the probable
con&s;equence of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation to
him&s;elf; but Vivaldi, in an agony of
horror, had been calling ince&s;&s;antly for
the medicine, which might po&s;&s;ibly afford
&s;ome relief to the angui&s;h he witne&s;&s;ed;
and when it was brought, he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to
&s;upport the &s;uffers.</P>
<P>At length, now that the wor&s;t was
over, and when the &s;everal witne&s;&s;es had
&s;igned to the la&s;t avowal of Schedoni,
every per&s;on in the chamber was &s;uffered
to depart; and Vivaldi was re-conducted
to his pri&s;on, accompanied by the Mar|che&s;e,
where he was to remain till the
deci&s;ion of the holy office re&s;pecting his
innocence, as a&s;&s;erted by the depo&s;ition of
Schedoni &s;hould be known. He was
too much affected by the late &s;cene to
give the Marche&s;e any explanation at
pre&s;ent, re&s;pecting the family of Ellena
di Ro&s;alba, and the Marche&s;e, having re|mained
for &s;ome time with his &s;on, with|drew
to the re&s;idence of his friend.</P>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL>
<P>In con&s;equence of the dying con&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Schedoni, an order was &s;ent from the
holy office for the relea&s;e of Vivaldi, with|in
a few days after the death of the Confe&s;&s;or;
and the Marche&s;e conducted his
&s;on from the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition to
the man&s;ion of his friend the Count di
Maro, with whom he had re&s;ided &s;ince
his arrival at Rome.</P>
<P>While they were receiving the ceremo|nious
congratulations of the Count, and
of &s;ome nobles a&s;&s;embled to welcome the
emancipated pri&s;oner, a loud voice was
heard from the anti-chamber exclaiming,
&startq;Let me pa&s;s! It is my ma&s;ler, let me
<PB N="416" REF="417">
pa&s;s! May all tho&s;e who attempt to &s;top
me, be &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition them&s;elves!&endq;</P>
<P>In the next in&s;tant Paulo bur&s;t into the
&s;aloon, followed by a group of lacqueys,
who, however, pau&s;ed at the door, fear|ful
of the di&s;plea&s;ure of their lord, yet
&s;carcely able to &s;ti&s;le a laugh; while Paulo,
&s;pringing forward, had nearly over&s;et
&s;ome of the company, who happened at
that moment to be bowing with pro|found
joy to Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;It is my ma&s;ter! it is my dear ma&s;ter!&endq;
cried Paulo, and, &s;ending off a nobleman
with each elbow, as he made his way be|tween
them, he hugged Vivaldi in his
arms, repeating, &startq;O, my matter! my
matter!&endq; till a pa&s;&s;ion of joy and affection
overcame his voice, and he fell at his
ma&s;ter's feet and wept.</P>
<P>This was a moment of finer joy to
Vivaldi, than he had known &s;ince his
meeting with his father, and he was too
much intere&s;ted by his faithful &s;ervant, to
<PB N="417" REF="418">
have lei&s;ure to apologize to the a&s;toni&s;hed
company for his rudene&s;s. While the
lacqueys were repairing the mi&s;chief Paulo
had occa&s;ioned, were picking up the rol|ling
&s;nuff-boxes he had jerked, away in
his pa&s;&s;age, and wiping the &s;nuff from the
&s;oiled clothes, Vivaldi was participating in
all the delight, and returning all the affect|tion
of his &s;ervant, and was &s;o wholly occu|pied
by the&s;e plea&s;urable feelings as &s;carce|ly
to be &s;en&s;ible that any per&s;ons be&s;ides
them&s;elves were in the room. The Mar|che&s;e,
meanwhile was making a thou&s;and
apologies for the di&s;a&s;ters Paulo had occa|&s;ioned;
was alternately calling upon him
to recollect in who&s;e pre&s;ence he was,
and to quit the apartment immediately;
explaining to the company that he had
not &s;een Vivaldi &s;ince they were together
in the Inqui&s;ition, and remarking pro|foundly,
that he was much attached to
his ma&s;ter. But Paulo, in&s;en&s;ible to the
<PB N="418" REF="419">
repeated commands of the Marche&s;e, and
to the endeavours of Vivaldi to rai&s;e him,
was &s;till pouring forth his whole heart
at his ma&s;ter's feet. &startq;Ah! my Signor,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;if you could but know how
mi&s;erable I was when I got out of the
Inqui&s;ition!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;He raves!&endq; ob&s;erved the Count to
the Marche&s;e, &startq;you perceive that joy has
rendered him delirious!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How I wandered about the walls
half the night, and what it co&s;t me to
leave them! But when I lo&s;t fight of
them, Signor, O! San Dominico! I
thought my heart would have broke. I
tad a great mind to have gone back again
and given my&s;elf up; and, perhaps, I
&s;hould too, if it had not been for my
friend, the centinel, who e&s;caped with
me, and I would not do him an injury,
poor fellow! for he meant nothing but
kindne&s;s when he let me out. And &s;ure
<PB N="419" REF="420">
enough, as it has proved, it was all for
the be&s;t, for now I am here, too, Signor,
as well as you; and can tell you all I felt
when I believed I &s;hould never &s;ee you
again.&endq;</P>
<P>The contra&s;t of his pre&s;ent joy to
his remembered grief again brought
tears into Paulo's eyes; he &s;miled and
wept, and &s;obbed and laughed with
&s;uch rapid tran&s;ition, that Vivaldi began
to be alarmed for him; when, &s;uddenly
becoming calm, he looked up in his
ma&s;ter's face and &s;aid gravely, but with
eagerne&s;s, &startq;Pray Signor, was not the
roof of your little pri&s;on peaked, and was
there not a little turret &s;tuck up at one
corner of it? and was there not a battle|ment
round the turret? and was there
not&endq;&mdash;Vivaldi, after regarding him for
a moment, replied &s;milingly, &startq;Why
truly, my good Paulo, my dungeon was
&s;o far from, the roof, that I never had an
opportunity of ob&s;erving it.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="421">
&startq;That is very true, Signor,&endq; replied
Paulo, &startq;very true indeed; but I did not
happen to think of that. I am certain,
though, it was as I &s;ay, and I was &s;ure of
it at the time. O Signor! I thought that
roof would have broke my heart, O how
I did look at it! and now to think that I
am here, with my dear ma&s;ter once
again!&endq;</P>
<P>As Paulo concluded, his tears and &s;obs re|turned
with more violence than before; and
Vivaldi, who could not perceive any nece&s;|&s;ery
connection between this mention of the
roof of his late pri&s;on, and the joy his &s;er|vant
expre&s;&s;ed on &s;eeing him again, began to
fear that his &s;en&s;es were bewildered, and
de&s;ired an explanation of his words,
Paulo's account, rude and &s;imple as it
was, &s;oon di&s;covered to him the relation
of the&s;e apparently heterogeneous circum|&s;tances
to each other; when Vivaldi,
overcome by this new in&s;tance of the
power of Paulo's affection, embraced him
<PB N="421" REF="422">
with his whole heart, and, compelling,
him to ri&s;e, pre&s;ented him to the a&s;&s;embly
as his faithful friend, and chief deliverer.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e, affected by the &s;cene he
had witne&s;&s;ed, and with the truth of
Vivaldi's words, conde&s;cended to give
Paulo a hearty &s;hake by the hand, and to
thank him warmly for the bravery and
fidelity he had di&s;played in his ma&s;ter's
intere&s;t. &startq;I never can fully reward your
attachment, added the Marche&s;e, &startq;but
what remains for me to do, &s;hall be done.
From this moment I make you indepen|dent,
and promi&s;e, in the pre&s;ence of this
noble company, to give you a thou&s;and
&s;equins, as &s;ome acknowledgement of
your &s;ervices.&endq;</P>
<P>Paulo did not expre&s;s all the gratitude
for this gift which the Marche&s;e expected.
He &s;tammered, and bowed and blu&s;hed,
and at length bur&s;t into tears; and when
Vivaldi inquired what di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him, he
replied, &startq;Why, Signor, of what u&s;e are
<PB N="422" REF="423">
the thou&s;and &s;equins to me, if I am to be
independent! what u&s;e if I am not to &s;tay
with you?&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi cordially allured Paulo, that
he &s;hould always remain with him, and
that he &s;hould con&s;ider it as his duty to
render his future life happy. &startq;You &s;hall
henceforth,&endq; added Vivaldi, &startq;be placed
at the head of my hou&s;hold; the manage|ment
of my &s;ervants, and the whole con|duct
of my dome&s;tic concerns &s;hall be
committed to you, as a proof of my entire
confidence in your integrity and attach|ment;
and becau&s;e this is a &s;ituation
which will allow you to be always near
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thank you, my Signor,&endq; replied
Paulo, in a voice rendered almo&s;t inarti|culate
by his gratitude, &startq;Thank you with
my whole heart! if I &s;tay with you, that
is enough for me, I a&s;k no more. But I
hope my Lord Marche&s;e will not think
me ungrateful for refu&s;ing to accept of the
<PB N="423" REF="424">
thou&s;and &s;equins he was &s;o kind as to
offer me, if I would but be independent,
for I thank him as much as if I had re|ceived
them, and a great deal more too.&endq;</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e, &s;miling at Paulo's mi&s;|take,
rejoined, &startq;As I do not perceive, my
good friend, how your remaining with
your ma&s;ter can be a circum&s;tance to
di&s;qualify you from accepting a thou&s;and
&s;equins, I command you, on pain of my
di&s;plea&s;ure, to receive them; and when|ever
you marry, I &s;hall expect that you
will &s;hew your obedience to me again, by
accepting another thou&s;and from me with,
your wife, as her dower.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is too much, Signor,&endq; &s;aid
Paulo &s;obbing&mdash;&startq;too much to be borne!&endq;
and ran out of the &s;aloon. But amid&s;t
the murmur of applau&s;e which his con|duct
drew from the noble &s;pectators, for
Paulo's warm heart had &s;ubdued even the
coldne&s;s of their pride, a convul&s;ive &s;ound
from the anti-chamber betrayed the exce&s;s
<PB N="424" REF="425">
of emotion, which he had thus abruptly
withdrawn him&s;elf to conceal.</P>
<P>In a few hours, the Marche&s;e and Vi|valdi
took leave of their friends, and &s;et
out for Naples, where they arrived, with|out
any interruption, on the fourth day.
But it was a melancholy journey to Vi|valdi,
notwithstanding the joy of his late
e&s;cape; for the Marche&s;e, having intro|duced
the mention of his attachment to
Ellena di Ro&s;alba, informed him, that,
under the pre&s;ent unfore&s;een circum|&s;tances,
he could not con&s;ider his late
engagement to the Marche&s;a on that &s;ub|ject
as binding, and that Vivaldi mu&s;t
relinqui&s;h. Ellena, if it &s;hould appear that
&s;he really was the daughter of the late
Schedoni.</P>
<P>Immediately on his arrival at Naples,
however, Vivaldi, with a degree of im|patience,
to which his utmo&s;t &s;peed was
inadequate, and with a revived joy &s;o
powerful as to overcome every fear, and
<PB N="425" REF="426">
every melancholy con&s;ideration, which
the late conver&s;ation with his father had
occa&s;ioned, ha&s;tened to the <HI>Santa della
Pi&eacute;ta.</HI></P>
<P>Ellena heard his voice from the grate,
inquiring for her of a nun, who was
in the parlour, and in the next in&s;tant
they beheld each other yet once again.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a meeting, after the long un|certainty
and terror, which each had &s;uf|fered
for the fate of the other, and the
dangers and hard&s;hips they had really in|curred,
joy was exalted almo&s;t to agony.
Ellena wept, and &s;ome minutes pa&s;&s;ed
before &s;he could an&s;wer to Vivaldi's few
words of tender exclamation: it was long
ere &s;he was tranquil enough to ob&s;erve
the alteration, which &s;evere confinement
had given to his appearance. The ani|mated
expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance was
unchanged; yet, when the fir&s;t glow of
joy had faded from it, and Ellena had
<PB N="426" REF="427">
lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve its wanne&s;s, &s;he under|&s;tood,
too certainly, that he had been a
pri&s;oner in the Inquisition.</P>
<P>During this interview, he related, at
Ellena's reque&s;t, the particulars of his
adventures, &s;ince he had been &s;eparated
from her in the chapel of San Seba&s;tian;
but, when he came to that part of the
narration where it was nece&s;&s;ary to men|tion
Schedoni, he pau&s;ed in unconquer|able
embarra&s;sment and a di&s;tre&s;s not
unmingled with horror. Vivaldi could
&s;carcely endure even to hint to Ellena any
part of the unju&s;t conduct, which the
Confe&s;&s;or had practi&s;ed towards him, yet
it was impo&s;&s;ible to conclude his ac|count,
without expre&s;&s;ing much more than
hints; nor could he bear to afflict her
with a knowledge of the death of him
who he believed to be her parent, how|ever
the dreadful circum&s;tances of that
event might be concealed. His embar|ra&s;sment
became obvious, and was &s;till
increa&s;ed by Ellena's inquiries.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="428">
At length, as an introduction to the
information it was nece&s;&s;ary to give, and
to the fuller explanation he wi&s;hed to
receive upon a &s;ubject, which, though it
was the one that pre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly
upon his mind, he had not yet dared to
mention, Vivaldi ventured to declare his
knowledge of her having di&s;covered her
parent to be living. The &s;atisfaction im|mediately
apparent upon Ellena's coun|tenance
heightened his di&s;tre&s;s, and his
reluctance to proceed; believing, as he
did, that the event he had to communicate
mu&s;t change her gladne&s;s to grief.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ellena, however, upon this mention of
a topic &s;o intere&s;ting to them both, pro|ceeded
to expre&s;s the happine&s;s &s;he had re|ceived
from the di&s;covery of a parent, who&s;e
virtues had even won her affection long be|fore
&s;he under&s;tood her own intere&s;t in them.
It was with &s;ome difficulty, that Vivaldi
could conceal his &s;urprize at &s;uch an
avowal of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the manners of
<PB N="428" REF="429">
Schedoni, of whom he believed her to
&s;peak, having certainly never been adapt|ed
to in&s;pire tenderne&s;s. But his &s;urprize
&s;oon changed its object, when Olivia,
who had heard that a &s;tranger was at the
grate, entered the parlour, and was an|nounced
as the mother of Ellena di Ro|&s;alba.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi left the convent, a full
explanation, as to family, was given on
both &s;ides, when he had the in&s;inite joy
of learning, that Ellena was not the
daughter of Schedoni; and Olivia had
the &s;atisfaction to know that &s;he had no
future evil to apprehend from him who
had hitherto been her wor&s;t enemy. The
manner of his death, however, with all
the circum&s;tances of his character, as un|folded
by his late trial, Vivaldi was care|ful
to conceal.</P>
<P>When Ellena had withdrawn from the
room, Vivaldi made a full acknowledg|ment
to Olivia of his long attachment to
<PB N="429" REF="430">
her daughter, and &s;upplicated for her
con&s;ent to their marriage. To this ap|plication,
however, Olivia replied, that,
though &s;he had long been no &s;tranger to
their mutual affection, or to the &s;everal
circum&s;tances which had both proved its
durability, and tried their fortitude, &s;he
never could con&s;ent that her daughter
&s;hould become a member of any family,
who&s;e principal was either in&s;en&s;ible of
her value, or unwilling to acknowledge
it; and that in this in&s;tance it would be
nece&s;&s;ary to Vivaldi's &s;ucce&s;s, not only
that he, but that his father &s;hould be a
&s;uitor; on which condition only, &s;he al|lowed
him to hope for her acquie&s;|cence.</P>
<P>Such a &s;tipulation &s;carcely chilled the
hopes of Vivaldi, now that Ellena was
proved to be the daughter not of the
murderer Schedoni, but of a Count di
Bruno, who had been no le&s;s re&s;pectable
in character than, in rank; and he had
<PB N="430" REF="431">
little doubt that his father would con&s;ent
to fulfil the promi&s;e he had given to the
dying Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>In this belief he was not mi&s;taken.
The Marche&s;e, having attended to Vi|valdi's
account of Ellena's family, pro|mi&s;ed,
that if it &s;hould appear there was
no &s;econd mi&s;take on the &s;ubject, he
would not longer oppo&s;e the wi&s;hes of
his &s;on.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e immediately cau&s;ed a
private inquiry to be made as to the iden|tity
of Olivia, the pre&s;ent Counte&s;s di
Bruno; and, though this was not pur|&s;ued
without difficulty, the phy&s;ician, who
had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the plan of her e&s;cape from
the cruelty of Ferando di Bruno, and
who was living, as well as Beatrice, who
clearly remembered the &s;i&s;ter of her late
mi&s;tre&s;s, at length rendered Olivia's iden|tity
unque&s;tionable. Now, therefore, that
the Marche&s;e's every doubt was removed,
he paid a vi&s;it to the <HI>Santa della Pi&eacute;ta,</HI>
<PB N="431" REF="432">
and &s;olicited, in due form, Olivia's con|&s;ent
to the nuptials of Vivaldi with El|lena;
which &s;he granted him with an
entire &s;atisfaction. In this interview, the
Marche&s;e was &s;o much fa&s;cinated by the
manner&s; of the Counte&s;s, and plea&s;ed
with the delicacy and &s;weetne&s;s, which ap|peared
in tho&s;e of Ellena, that his con|&s;ent
was no longer a con&s;trained one, and
he willingly relinqui&s;hed the views of &s;u|perior
rank and fortune, which he had for|merly
looked to for his &s;on, for tho&s;e of
virtue and permanent happine&s;s that
were now unfolded to him.</P>
<P>On the twentieth of May, the day on
which Ellena completed her eighteenth
year, her nuptials with Vivaldi were &s;o|lemnized
in the church of the <HI>Santa Ma|ria
della Pi&eacute;ta,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of the
Marche&s;e and of the Counte&s;s di Bruno.
As Ellena advanced through the church,
&s;he recollected, when on a former occa|&s;ion
<PB N="432" REF="433">
&s;he had met Vivaldi at the altar, and,
the &s;cenes of San Seba&s;tian ri&s;ing to her
memory, the happy character of tho&s;e,
which her pre&s;ent &s;ituation oppo&s;ed to
them, drew tears of tender joy and gra|titude
to her eyes. Then, irre&s;olute, de|&s;olate,
&s;urrounded by &s;trangers, and en|&s;nared
by enemies, &s;he had believed &s;he
&s;aw Vivaldi for the la&s;t time; now, &s;up|ported
by the pre&s;ence of a beloved pa|rent,
and by the willing approbation of
the per&s;on, who had hitherto &s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly
oppo&s;ed her, they were met to part
no more; and, as a recollection of the
moment when &s;he had been carried from
the chapel glanced upon, her mind, that
moment when &s;he had called upon him
for &s;uccour, &s;upplicated even to hear his
voice once more, and when a blank
&s;ilence, which, as &s;he believed, was that
of death, had &s;ucceeded; as the angui&s;h
of that moment was now remembered,
<PB N="433" REF="434">
Ellena became more than ever &s;en&s;ible of
the happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Olivia, in thus relinqui&s;hing her daugh|ter
&s;o &s;oon after &s;he had found her, &s;uf|fered
&s;ome pain, but &s;he was con&s;oled by
the fair pro&s;pect of happine&s;s, that open|ed
to Ellena, arid cheered, by con&s;ider|ing,
that, though &s;he relinqui&s;hed, &s;he
&s;hould not lo&s;e her, &s;ince the vicinity
of Vivaldi's residence to <HI>La Pi&eacute;ta,</HI> would
permit a frequent intercour&s;e with the
convent.</P>
<P>As a te&s;timony of &s;ingular e&s;teem,
Paulo was permitted to be pre&s;ent at the
marriage of his ma&s;ter, when, as perched
in a high gallery of the church, he looked
down upon the ceremony, and witne&s;&s;ed
the delight in Vivaldi's countenance, the
&s;atisfaction in that of my &startq;old Lord
Marche&s;e,&endq; the pen&s;ive happine&s;s in the
Counte&s;s di Bruno's, and the tender com|placency
of Ellena's, which her veil,
<PB N="434" REF="435">
partly undrawn, allowed him to ob&s;erve,

<P>The f&ecirc;te which, &s;ome time after the
nuptials, was given by the Marche&s;e, in
celebration of them, was held at a de|lightful
villa, belonging to Vivaldi, a few
miles di&s;tant from Naples, upon the bor|der
of the gulf, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore
to that which had been the frequent abode
of the Marche&s;a. The beauty of its &s;itu|ation
and its interior elegance induced
Vivaldi and Ellena to &s;elect it as their
chief re&s;idence. It was, in truth, a &s;cene
of fairy-land. The plea&s;ure-grounds ex|tended
<PB N="436" REF="437">
over a valley, which opened to the
bay, and the hou&s;e &s;tood at the entrance
of this valley, upon a gentle &s;tope that
margined the water, and commanded
the whole extent of its luxuriant &s;hores,
from the lofty cape of Mi&s;eno to the
bold mountains of the &s;outh, which,
&s;tretching acro&s;s the di&s;tance, appeared
to ri&s;e out of the &s;ea, and divided the
gulf of Naples from that of Salerno.</P>
<P>The marble porticoes and arcades of the
villa were &s;hadowed by groves of the beau|tiful
magnolia flowering a&s;h, cedrati, ca|mellias,
and maje&s;tic palms; and the cool
and airy halls, opening on two oppo&s;ite
&s;ides to a colonade, admitted beyond the
rich &s;oliage all the &s;eas and &s;hores of
Naples, from the we&s;t; and to the ea&s;t,
views of the valley of the domain, with|drawing
among winding hills wooded to
their &s;ummits, except where cliffs of va|rious-coloured
granites, yellow, green,
<PB N="437" REF="438">
and purple, lifted their tall heads, and
threw gay gleams of light amid&s;t the
umbrageous land&s;cape.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle of the gardens, where lawns
and groves, and woods varied the undu|lating
&s;urface, was, that of England, and
of the pre&s;ent day, rather than of Italy;
except &startq;Where a long alley peeping
on the main,&endq; exhibited &s;uch gigantic
loftine&s;s of &s;hade, and grandeur of per|&s;pective,
as characterize the Italian
ta&s;te.</P>
<P>On this jubilee, every avenue and
grove, and pavilion was richly illumi|nated.
The villa it&s;elf, where each airy
hall and arcade was re&s;plendent with
lights, and lavi&s;hly decorated with flow|ers
and the mo&s;t beautiful &s;hrubs, who&s;e
buds &s;eemed to pour all Arabia's perfumes
upon the air, this villa re&s;embled a fabric
called up by enchantment, rather than a
&s;tructure of human art.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="439">
The dre&s;&s;es of the higher rank of vi&s;i|tors
were as &s;plendid as the &s;cenery, of
which Ellena was, in every re&s;pect, the
queen. But this entertainment was not
given to per&s;ons of di&s;tinction only, for
both Vivaldi and Ellena had wi&s;hed that
all the tenants of the domain &s;hould par|take
of it, and &s;hare the abundant hap|pine&s;s
which them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; &s;o that
the grounds, which were exten&s;ive enough
to accommodate each rank, were relin|qui&s;hed
to a general gaiety. Paulo, was,
on this occa&s;ion, a &s;ort of ma&s;ter of the
revels; and, &s;urrounded by a party of his
own particular a&s;&s;ociates, danced once
more, as he had &s;o often wi&s;hed, upon
the moon-light &s;hore of Naples.</P>
<P>As Vivaldi and Ellena were palling the
&s;pot, which Paulo had cho&s;en for the &s;cene
of his fe&s;tivity, they pau&s;ed to ob&s;erve
his &s;trange capers and extravagant ge&s;ticu|lation,
as he mingled in the dance, while
every now-and-then he &s;houted forth,
<PB N="439" REF="440">
though half breathle&s;s with the heartine&s;s
of the exerci&s;e, &startq;<HI>O! giorno fel&iacute;ce! O!
giorno fel&iacute;ce!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>On perceiving Vivaldi, and the &s;miles
with which he and Ellena regarded him,
he quitted his &s;ports, and advancing,
&startq;Ah! my dear ma&s;ter,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;do
you remember the night, when we were
travelling on the banks of the Celano,
before that diabolical accident happened
in the chapel of San Seba&s;tian; don't
you remember how tho&s;e people, who
were tripping it away &s;o joyou&s;ly, by
moonlight, reminded me of Naples and
the many merry dances I had footed on
the beach here?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I remember it well,&endq; replied Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! Signor <HI>mio,</HI> you &s;aid at the
time, that you hoped we &s;hould &s;oon be
here, and that then I &s;hould fri&s;k it away
with as glad a heart as the be&s;t of them.
The fir&s;t part of your hope, my dear
<PB N="440" REF="441">
ma&s;ter, you was out in, for, as it hap|pened,
we had to go through purgatory
before we could reach paradi&s;e; but the
&s;econd part is come at la&s;t;&mdash;for here I
am, &s;ure enough! dancing by moonlight,
in my own dear bay of Naples, with my
own dear ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, in &s;afety, and
as happy <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as my&s;elf; and with that
old mountain yonder, Ve&s;uvius, which I,
for&s;ooth! thought I was never to &s;ee
again, &s;pouting up fire, ju&s;t as it u&s;ed
to do before we got our&s;elves put into the
Inqui&s;ition! O! who could have fore|&s;een
all this! <HI>O! giorno felice! O!
giorno fel&iacute;ce!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I rejoice in your happine&s;s, my good
Paulo,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;almo&s;t as much
as in my own; though I do not entirely
agree with you as to the comparative
proportion of each.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Paulo!&endq; &s;aid Ellena, &startq;I am in|debted
to you beyond any ability to re|pay;
<PB N="441" REF="442">
for to your intrepid affection your
ma&s;ter owes his pre&s;ent &s;afety. I will not
attempt to thank you for your attach|ment
to him; my care of your welfare &s;hall
prove how well I know it; but I wi&s;h to
give to all your friends this acknowledg|ment
of your worth, and of my &s;en&s;e of
it.&endq;</P>
<P>Paulo bowed, and &s;tammered, and
writhed and blu&s;hed, and was unable to
reply; till, at length, giving a &s;udden
and lofty &s;pring from the ground, the
emotion which had nearly &s;tifled him
bur&s;t forth in words, and &startq;<HI>O! giorno
fel&iacute;ce! O! giorno fel&iacute;ce!</HI>&endq; flew from
his
lips with the force of an electric &s;hock.
They communicated his enthu&s;ia&s;m to
the whole company, the words pa&s;&s;ed
like lightning from one individual to ano|ther,
till Vivaldi and Ellena withdrew
amid&s;t a choral &s;hout, and all the woods
and &s;trands of Naples re-echoed with&mdash;
&startq;<HI>O! giorno fel&iacute;ce! O! giorno fel&iacute;ce!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="443">
&startq;You &s;ee,&endq; &s;aid Paulo, when they had
departed, and he came to him&s;elf again,
&startq;You &s;ee how people get through their
misfortunes, if they have but a heart to
bear up again&s;t them, and do nothing
that can lie on their con&s;cience after|wards;
and how &s;uddenly one comes to
be happy, ju&s;t when one is beginning to
think one never is to be happy again!
Who would have gue&s;&s;ed that my dear
ma&s;ter and I, when we were clapped up
in that diabolical place, the Inqui&s;ition,
&s;hould ever come out again into this
world! Who would have gue&s;&s;ed when
we were taken before tho&s;e old devils of
Inqui&s;itors, &s;itting there all of a row in a
place under ground, hung with black,
and nothing but torches all around, and
faces grinning at us, that looked as black
as the gentry afore&s;aid; and when I was
not &s;o much as &s;uffered to open my mouth,
no! they would not let me open my mouth
to my ma&s;ter!&mdash;who, I &s;ay, would have
<PB N="443" REF="444">
gue&s;&s;ed we &s;hould ever be let loo&s;e again!
who would have thought we &s;hould ever
know what it is to be happy! Yet here we
are all abroad once more! All at liberty!
And may run, if we will, &s;traight forward,
from one end of the earth to the other,
and back again without being &s;topped!
May fly in the &s;ea, or &s;wim in the &s;ky,
or tumble over head and heels into the
moon! For remember, my good friends,
we have no lead in our con&s;ciences to
keep us down!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You mean &s;wim in the &s;ea, and fly
in the &s;ky, I &s;uppo&s;e,&endq; ob&s;erved a grave
per&s;onage near him, &startq;but as for tumbling
over head and heels into the moon! I
don't know what you mean by that!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;P&s;haw!&endq; replied Paulo, &startq;who can
&s;top, at &s;uch a time as this, to think
about what he means! I wi&s;h that all
tho&s;e, who on this night are not merry
enough to &s;peak before they think, may
ever after be grave enough to think before
<PB N="444" REF="445">
they &s;peak! But you, none of you, no!
not one of you! I warrant, ever &s;aw the
roof of a pri&s;on, when your ma&s;ter hap|pened
to be below in the dungeon, nor
know what it is to be forced to run away,
and leave him behind to die by him&s;elf.
Poor &s;ouls! But no matter for that, you
can be tolerably happy, perhaps, notwith|&s;tanding;
but as for gue&s;&s;ing how happy
I am, or knowing any thing about the
matter.&mdash;O! it's quite beyond what
you can under&s;tand. <HI>O! giorno felice!
O! giorno felice!</HI>&endq; repeated Paulo, as he
bounded forward to mingle in the dance,
and &startq;<HI>O! giorno felice!</HI>&endq; was again
&s;houted in chorus by his joyful compa|nions.</P>
