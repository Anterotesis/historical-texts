<P>THIS quotation from a Greek, and con&s;equently a heathen Poet, the eloquent Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles conde|&s;cended to u&s;e, when he was endea|vouring to convert the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of human wi&s;dom, from the greate&s;t proof of human folly, the wor&s;hip of idols; when he was a&s;&s;erting the unity of that great fir&s;t cau&s;e, which they &s;o little un|der&s;tood, as to erect an altar to him un|der the appellation of <HI>the unknown God</HI>. <Q>This univer&s;al &s;ource of life, breath, and
<PB N="8" REF="4">
all created beings, he declares to them, &startq;made of one blood, all men to dwell on &endq;the face of the earth," and determined, by his divine Pre&s;cience, both the times of their exi&s;tence, and the bounds of their habitation.</Q></P>
<P>Of the&s;e two fundamental truths, upon which not only natural but revealed reli|gion is founded, the exi&s;tence of a fir&s;t cau&s;e, and the deduction thence of all created beings, it is clear from the text that the heathens them&s;elves were apprized, tho' they failed to draw from them that con&s;equence, which, of all others, &s;eems the mo&s;t natural, that created beings, of the &s;ame &s;pecies, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be, one to another, in a &s;tate of equality, and that the human &s;pecies, in particular, being, as the Apo&s;tle phra&s;es it, of the &s;ame blood, had all
<PB N="9" REF="5">
of them the &s;ame preten&s;ions to the equal ble&s;&s;ings of nature, being formed by the &s;ame hand, and endued with the &s;ame faculties for enjoying plea&s;ure, and &s;uffering pain; that though the place or climate in which they happened to be born, and the time of their birth, or, to &s;peak more accurately in the words of St. Paul, "the times which God had appointed them, and the bounds of their habitation" might occa&s;ion &s;ome acciden|tal difference as to the cultivation of tho&s;e faculties, and the modes of tho&s;e plea&s;ures and pains, yet the original ca|pacity for all of them was &s;till the &s;ame, and that all being alike human creatures, there was neither gift nor faculty be&s;towed on the nature of huma|nity that belonged of right more to one than another of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="6">To the divine mi&s;&s;ion of St. Paul, no|thing was more nece&s;&s;ary than the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of this primary truth; he was the profe&s;&s;ed apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, and under that character had as many preju|dices to overcome as if, like St. Peter, he had only been the apo&s;tle of the Jews and their pro&s;elytes. The Jews, deeming them&s;elves the peculiar people of God, we know, had the &s;tronge&s;t objection imaginable to a Me&s;&s;iah who was to &s;ave or redeem any nation except their own; and the Greeks, who held all nations but theirs to be barbarians, were full as un|likely to embrace a faith to be held in common, not only with the Jews, but the re&s;t of a barbarous world: The doc|trine which exhorted all men, wherever &s;ituated, to embrace one common &s;alva|tion, was therefore as little &s;uited to the preten&s;ions of the one as to the pride of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="7">But though St. Paul, by proceeding upon this fundamental truth, and thence deducing the doctrine of an univer&s;al Redeemer, di&s;&s;eminated the go&s;pel &s;o far, as to make the &s;ucce&s;s of his preach|ing a miracle almo&s;t equal to any per|formed by his divine ma&s;ter, in&s;omuch that infidelity has been put to its utmo&s;t &s;ubterfuges to invalidate its force; yet this truth it&s;elf, this nece&s;&s;ary inference from the go&s;pel, that all men are the offspring of God, was not, either by him&s;elf of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, &s;o far e&s;tabli&s;hed in a refractory world as to make it an univer&s;al rule of mo|ral action; nay, we have it &s;till to lament that it is as little attended to at this pre|&s;ent hour, as it was when the apo&s;tle fir&s;t preached it to the Athenians. The di&s;tinction between Greek and Barbarian has indeed cea&s;ed, or rather names and &s;cenes are &s;hifted, and the Greeks are now
<PB N="12" REF="8">
become, in the eyes of the more civilized nations in Europe, them&s;elves barbarians; yet every di&s;tinct European &s;tate, in pro|portion as it acquires a real, or even an a&s;&s;umed preten&s;ion to &s;uperior civiliza|tion, is too apt to impute to the re&s;t of the world a proportional degree of barba|rity, and con&s;equently, whatever they may think, they are &s;ometimes inclined to act toward them as if they were not of the &s;ame &s;acred original. Nor is this much to be wondered at, when we re|flect that the &s;ame fal&s;e notion prevails among&s;t individuals of the &s;ame nation: Every accidental advantage, which either birth, riches, or education gives, becomes nutriment to this over-weening pride, and equally leads the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them to behave to tho&s;e who want &s;uch ca&s;ual advantages, as if they derived their ex|i&s;tence from two different &s;ources.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="9">But there is one enormous prejudice of this kind, which, for a long &s;eries of years, has infected the European part of the globe, not only individually but na|tionally; a prejudice which chri&s;tianity has almo&s;t univer&s;ally failed to eradicate, I mean that futile, but at the &s;ame time horrible, opinion, which, re&s;ting it&s;elf on argument that can go no deeper than the very &s;urface and tincture of the &s;kin, has led many, who yet call them&s;elve chri&s;|tians, to treat beings of the &s;ame divine origin with them&s;elves, even wor&s;e than they think them&s;elves permitted to treat the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h: Beings that have immortal &s;ouls like them&s;elves, en&s;hrined in a body which, tho' it has a variation of complexion, has hardly any in form or in feature. This more than Pagan prejudice I &s;hould think my&s;elf worthily employed in execrating through the re|mainder
<PB N="14" REF="10">
of this di&s;cour&s;e, did I not fore|&s;ee, with heart-felt &s;atisfaction, that wi&s;er and better heads than my own are about to endeavour, by the be&s;t and mo&s;t legal means, at a demolition of the evil, by putting a &s;top to that merchandize, dreadful term! when employed to &s;ignify the traffic which MEN make of MEN, which has &s;o long been the wor&s;t of di&s;|graces to the name of Chri&s;tians and of Britons.</P>
<P>But were I to enter the li&s;ts again&s;t tho&s;e, and, to the di&s;grace of the very name of man, &s;ome there are who vin|dicate what they call the SLAVE TRADE, and who, by the very term they u&s;e, do enough to make every benevolent brea&s;t receive their arguments with dete&s;tation, I &s;hould think that I profaned the &s;anctity of this place, that I di&s;graced the dignity
<PB N="15" REF="11">
of my &s;ubject, which is no le&s;s than the great cau&s;e of humanity; I &s;hould think that I &s;urrendered the principles of chri&s;|tianity, if I conde&s;cended to an&s;wer any of their political rea&s;onings; or even deigned to take into con&s;ideration the advantages which accrue from the permi&s;&s;ion, or the di&s;advantages which might re&s;ult from the prohibition of this inhuman barter. Still more &s;hould I think that I did di&s;|honour to my&s;elf, as a preacher of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, if, with all the in&s;ipid coldne&s;s of a common morali&s;t, I &s;hould for a moment allow the intellectual faculties of the African man to be natu|rally inferior to tho&s;e of the European, and then philo&s;ophically argue, that as plants may be meliorated and become more vigorous by tran&s;planting them in|to a richer &s;oil, &s;o it might be po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="16" REF="12">
by the culture of education, to improve the intellects even of an African Savage.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the natural inferiority of their under&s;tanding makes the Ne|groes incapable of receiving &s;uch culture, will hardly be admitted by any true Chri&s;tian, who con&s;iders that the Apo&s;tle Philip was &s;ent, by a di|vinely appointed me&s;&s;enger, to meet the Ethiopian Eunuch at Gaza in the de&s;ert, and there baptize him. (See Acts viii. 26.) We are told here that this per&s;onage, the Trea&s;urer of Queen Candace, had before believed in the Divine Unity, and was on his journey to wor&s;hip at Jeru&s;alem, where he had probably been before admitted by the Jews as a pro&s;elyte of the gate. We find too that he was &s;ufficiently &s;killed in Hebrew literature to read the &s;ublime poetry of I&s;aiah, and that he was peculiarly cho&s;en of God to be one of the fir&s;t converts to Chri&s;|tianity, his conver&s;ion being placed in order of time before that of Saul. Such a believer will certainly thence infer, that as God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, he has made no di&s;tinction in his gifts to the Human Species. In pro&s;ecuting this di&s;qui&s;ition further, men of letters may perhaps be led to inve&s;tigate an opinion of a very late French writer, M. Vol|ney, who in his travels into Syria and Egypt (I quote from the Eng|li&s;h tran&s;lation of them, Vol. I. Page 81) has, among&s;t &s;ome other hi&s;torical rea&s;ons, adduced a pa&s;&s;age from Herodotus, who believes that as the Colchi were an antient colony from Egypt, they were, like the Egyptians, actually Negroes. The words of the Father of Hi&s;tory are, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. <HI>Liber</HI> ii. <HI>cap.</HI> 104. "That, like them, they have black &s;kins and frizzled hair." The reflection which the learned traveller makes on this is &s;o very appo&s;ite to the general doctrine of my di&s;cour&s;e, that it is on that account I have chiefly quoted it. <Q>&startq;This hi&s;torical fact affords to philo&s;ophy an intere&s;ting &s;ubject of reflection. How are we a&s;toni&s;hed when we behold the pre&s;ent barbari&s;m and ignorance of the Copts de&s;cended from the profound genius of the Egyptians, and the bril|liant intelligence of the Greeks; when we reflect that to the race of Negroes, at pre&s;ent our Slaves and the object of our extreme con|tempt, we owe our Arts, Sciences, and even the very u&s;e of Speech; and when we recollect that in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e nations, who call them&s;elves the Friends of Liberty and Humanity, the mo&s;t bar|barous of Slaveries is ju&s;tified, and that it is even a problem whether the under&s;tanding of Negroes be of the &s;ame &s;pecies with that of &endq;White Men!"</Q> P. 83.</P><P>But as the in&s;tance of <HI>one</HI> individual is with me, and perhaps will be with the generality of my readers, &s;ufficient to decide on this que&s;|tion, let me, la&s;tly, quote the letters of poor Ignatius Sancho, as a &s;ufficient proof not only of African Capacity, but of true humanity. This man received the principal advantages re&s;ulting from European culture, in a great family, in which he was many years a menial &s;er|vant, but which I &s;hould be apt to think not the be&s;t &s;chool, did I not at the &s;ame time reflect that the mo&s;t noble head of that family mu&s;t (I &s;peak from knowledge of his innate benevolence) have uniformly &s;et him the be&s;t of all examples.&mdash;<HI>See the Preface to</HI> Sancho's Letters.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="13">Far from my&s;elf, far from all who &s;hould either write, preach, or think upon the &s;ubject with the &s;pirit of tho&s;e go&s;pels in their minds, be &s;o tame, &s;o unanimated a mode of treating the &s;ub|ject.
<PB N="18" REF="14">
If ever Eloquence was in its place, here might it exert its utmo&s;t force, with|out a fear of mi&s;leading Rea&s;on, or of acting too powerfully upon the pa&s;&s;ions. If ever Argumentation, or Logic, can be u&s;ele&s;s or mi&s;applied, it is here they mu&s;t be &s;o, becau&s;e they would be employed in the refutation of &s;elf-evident fal&s;ehood. If ever the true genius of Chri&s;tianity, which is then be&s;t exerted when it gives glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good will towards men, can be urged with &s;uperior efficacy to this its twofold purpo&s;e, it mu&s;t be in reprobating a practice which derogates from the glory of that God, and &s;preads de&s;truction, carnage, and tyranny over a great part of that &s;pecies of beings born to be ra|tional, and capable, by good treatment, of being highly &s;o, and which he has dignified with the title of his offspring.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="15">But even from the la&s;t and be&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances, the in&s;pired writings them&s;elves, it &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary to bor|row aid on this occa&s;ion. Tho&s;e of my hearers, who are lea&s;t read in tho&s;e &s;acred pages, mu&s;t have learned from them this plain, yet important truth, that they ought to do to others as they would wi&s;h others &s;hould do to them; and they mu&s;t be ignorant indeed if they do not deduce from that divine rule this direct con&s;equence, that as they would not them&s;elves wi&s;h to be NEGRO SLAVES, &s;o they ought to wi&s;h, and as far as po&s;|&s;ible endeavour to free every Negro from the bonds of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>This matter then being &s;o very ob|vious to every under&s;tanding, I will venture to turn my di&s;cour&s;e to a topic, from which I conceive it po&s;&s;ible, yet
<PB N="20" REF="16">
barely po&s;&s;ible, that &s;ome little preju|dice may ari&s;e again&s;t this mo&s;t be|nevolent attempt, re&s;ulting from the place, time, and per&s;ons whence the hu|mane idea originated. It commenced fir&s;t, as is well known, in that part of America which was very lately &s;ubject to the crown of Great Britain, and &s;oon after the time when its inhabitants cea&s;ed to be our fellow-&s;ubjects, but not to be our fel|low-chri&s;tians. To de&s;cend more minutely into particulars (endeavouring at the &s;ame time cautiou&s;ly to avoid any expre&s;&s;ion that might tend to awaken the lea&s;t &s;park of jealou&s;y) it began, I believe, fir&s;t in the &s;tate of Pen&s;ylvania, wherein a religious &s;ect had long been e&s;tabli&s;hed, which, for certain &s;ingular notions and habits that they adopted, the di&s;&s;olute court of Charles the Second had called by an opprobrious name. But whatever might then, or may
<PB N="21" REF="17">
now be ju&s;tly objected to the&s;e notions, or to any enthu&s;ia&s;tic tenet of theirs, which we hold to be un&s;criptural, I have yet the boldne&s;s to a&s;&s;ert, that, as good &s;ubjects and good citizens, their conduct has long made them re&s;pectable; the di&s;creet management of their own poor has made them an object of emulation. It is true, that the &s;implicity of their manners, and of their deportment, may incur the con|tempt of the fal&s;ely polite, and the ridi|cule of frivolous and unfeeling fa&s;hion; yet &s;uch ridicule and &s;uch contempt, I am per&s;uaded, they will contentedly bear, if they can only gain, what is &s;urely their due, that attention to the example they have &s;et, which, de&s;pi&s;ing every idle prejudice, may lead all denomina|tions of Chri&s;tians heartily to concur in that righteous cau&s;e which they began di&s;intere&s;tedly, have pur&s;ued &s;teadily, and
<PB N="22" REF="18">
&s;eem to proceed in &s;ucce&s;sfully; in&s;o|much that, did the &s;obriety of their &s;ect &s;uffer them to glorify them&s;elves be|fore men, they might &s;ay with hone&s;t confidence, <Q>&startq;We are employed on a godly matter, a matter in which he, whom the Papacy has called the Mo&s;t Chri&s;|tian, and he whom he has called the Mo&s;t Catholic King, might be proud to join us. Thou al&s;o of all others mighte&s;t be proud to join us, who, inhe|riting by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that title of Defen|der of the Faith, which the &s;ame &s;pirit of Antichri&s;t fir&s;t conferred on a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry VIII. to whom Pope Leo X. gave this title as a reward for a defence of the Papal Power and Tenets which the king had written again&s;t Luther.</NOTE>tyrant, holde&s;t it now by the be&s;t of all human charters, the united &s;uffrages of a free &endq;and a prote&s;tant people."</Q> Thus might the&s;e plain men expre&s;s a bold, but at
<PB N="23" REF="19">
the &s;ame time a mo&s;t ju&s;t &s;entiment; and there is no doubt but that one of the&s;e Monarchs would, if directed only by the dictates of his own heart, be ready to join them. But the wi&s;dom of our con&s;titution, by &s;etting limits to his power, has, in this peculiar ca&s;e, &s;et limits to his humanity. He cannot, and, I tru&s;t, he would not wi&s;h to &s;ay <Q>&startq;I will by my own individual authority put an ab&s;olute &endq;prohibition on this unchri&s;tian traffic."</Q> <Q>But he might and would ju&s;tly &s;ay, &startq;to the petitions of my people, I will lend a ready ear; to the determinations of my &endq;parliament I will afford a joyful &s;anction."</Q> May he not be deprived of that joy! for who but the King of a free, as well as a Prote&s;tant nation, &s;hould have the glory of leading the other Potentates of Europe on &s;o godlike an enterprize.

the voice of his parliament be unanimous in the cau&s;e; in that cau&s;e may the pe|titions of his people be &s;trenuous, urgent, and univer&s;al.</P>
<P>To the univer&s;ality of &s;uch peti|tions I have the plea&s;ure to find that the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of this ancient city, and the wor&s;hipful the Aldermen have, like &s;ome other cor|porate bodies in the kingdom, judiciou&s;ly contributed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and hence it is rea&s;onably to be inferred, that the gentry, clergy, and all other its inhabitants will follow their laudable example. But <HI>laudable</HI> is too feeble an epithet on this occa&s;ion, it is moral Patrioti&s;m! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This epithet is &s;omewhat <HI>hazarded</HI>; I would be under&s;tood to mean by it, that as patrioti&s;m it&s;elf only &s;ignifies the love of our country, &s;o with this addition, the term indicates a love of mankind under the idea of <HI>one common family</HI>. Natural religion teaches this, but revelation goes farther, it bids to love and do good to all men as <HI>brethren</HI>; to endeavour therefore to give Slaves Freedom, becau&s;e they are our <HI>brethren</HI>, I denominate Chri&s;tian Heroi&s;m.

But as nothing re&s;embles the fate of the leaves of the Sibyls &s;o much as &s;ermons printed &s;ingly, I have not been able in this place to procure a copy of it in due time. I wi&s;h however to refer my readers to a very curious letter from the Indians in the back &s;ettlements of America, printed by the Society in the account of their proceeding that &s;ame year.
