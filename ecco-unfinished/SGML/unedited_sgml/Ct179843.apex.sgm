<HEAD>A LETTER TO Mr. <HI>BISSET</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Reverend</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot but expect that your late Re|marks on Dr. <HI>Sacheveral</HI>'s Sermon, has oc|ca&s;ioned various Speculations, in this Cri|tical Age: Every Man that Prints, Ap|als to the People who Read, and ought to be con|$t, to hear them pa&s;s their Cen&s;ures&mdash;Nor is it ju&s;t for <HI>any Man</HI> to An&s;wer, Cen&s;ure, or Animad|rt, upon a Printed Paper, provided only that his $&s;wers, Cen&s;ures or Animadver&s;ions, are but em&s;elves to be defended in the Nature of them: $d thus for the Author of <HI>Remarks,</HI> &amp;c. as he eaks to all the World, &s;o he makes them all dges of what he &s;ays&mdash;Upon this Foundation, I pre&s;ume a little to Animadvert upon your Re|$rks, on the Reverend Dr. <HI>Sacheveral</HI>'s Sermon, $ached at the Cathedral Church of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s, on late Anniver&s;ary, for the fifth of <HI>November</HI>&mdash;<HI>$d hope you will take it in good Part.</HI></P>
<P>&s;hall pa&s;s by all the Satyr you are plea&s;ed to let $word$ upon the Reverend Dr. for <HI>be it</HI> that he was
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<HI>little</HI> Tran&s;ported into <HI>&s;ome Things,</HI> which yo may call Indecencies: The Scripture Rule you we know, ought to prevail, that we &s;hould <HI>not rend$ Railing for Railing</HI>&mdash;and therefore from a Br|ther of the &s;ame Cloth, the Dr. no doubt, did n expect &s;uch Treatment.</P>
<P>Before I begin to Examine your particular R|marks, which I doubt not in their Order to pro|mo&s;t unju&s;t, and Impolitick, give me leave to O|ject in the fir&s;t place, again&s;t your General&mdash;A$ this perhaps, will appear as a &s;trong Argument, gain&s;t your real De&s;ign in the whole, <HI>viz.</HI> Expo&s;i$ and Exploding the Doctor's Sermon.</P>
<P>I begin with your Title, in which you call t Doctor's Sermon a <HI>Po&s;tilent</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;peak the SPREADING <HI>Malignity</HI> of it&mdash;Now real$ Sir in this I think you are very far out, <HI>I hope I will Pardon the Expre&s;&s;ion</HI> and tho' it be a wro$ way of Arguing, to undertake Negatives, yet p$|haps I may in the Sequel of this Sheet, prove <HI>to ye own Satisfaction,</HI> that the Doctor's Sermon had <HI>Malignity</HI> in it, nor was it in the lea&s;t <HI>Pe&s;tilentia$</HI> And as proving an Affirmative of a contrary $|ture, proves the Negative by Con&s;equence; &s;o $word$ prove the Dr's Di&s;cour&s;e <HI>Hone&s;t, Sea&s;onable, Profit</HI> and <HI>&V;&s;eful,</HI> I que&s;tion not, but you will Ingenuo$ own, I have proved Effectualy, that it is neit <HI>Malignant</HI> or <HI>Pe&s;tilential.</HI></P>
<P>But before I begin with this, I mu&s;t take le$ to Note a Word or two, of the Character of $word$ <HI>Sacheveral;</HI> which I &s;hall do, to clear up the $word$ Part, <HI>viz. That his Sermon was Hone&s;t</HI>&mdash;K$$ then, Sir, that the Reverend Dr. was a Fellow <HI>Magdalen College,</HI> in <HI>Oxford, and that</HI> before he Cho&s;en to St <HI>Mary-Overs</HI> in <HI>Southwark</HI>&mdash;W
<PB N="5" REF="4">
$e was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he became a Celebrated Preach|er upon the&s;e Publick Occa&s;ions&mdash;He Preached &s;everal A&s;&s;ize Sermons, and always Declared War $gain&s;t the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> hung out HIS FLAG of De|$ance again&s;t <HI>Toleration, Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> and <HI>Di&s;&s;enting</HI>&mdash;and being always thus profe&s;tly an Enemy to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>&mdash;his Sermon was <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> t was all of a piece, with his known Practice&mdash;<HI>&s;e knew well enough</HI> what was to be expected from him, and therefore I &s;ay <HI>it was hone&s;t</HI>&mdash;No Man was deceived in his Expectation&mdash;Nay farther, hey that Invited him, <HI>no doubt,</HI> knew what to ex|$ect, and did expect it, <HI>and for that End Invited</HI> him <HI>o Preach;</HI> and therefore had he failed of his Ordina|y Method, it had not been <HI>hone&s;t</HI> in him, he had Deceived his Employers, and not acted like him&s;elf; Nay, I believe I might appeal to your Self, Sir, if $ou did not expect what you found, when you $eard Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> was to Preach&mdash;and if you $ould not have profe&s;t your Self Cheated, and Di&s;|ppointed, if you had not heard &s;uch a Sermon?&mdash;$word$ is evident then, the Sermon was mo&s;t <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and <HI>ncere,</HI> that it was a Sermon Preached from the very deart of the Mini&s;ter Preaching:; <HI>Well would it e with us all, if all the Gentlemen of the Gown, would $ith equal &s;incerity, Preach what they believe, wi&s;h, and eartly Profe&s;s,</HI> as this Reverend Dr. has done.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, many of the Reverend Clergy at his time, may be as hearty in their Wi&s;hes, as this Gentleman, but they do not &s;peak it out &s;o hone&s;t|$&mdash;<HI>&s;uch plain Engli&s;h;</HI> They are &s;o Infected with hat Poi&s;onous Drug, called <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> that they $ince Mattters, and do not &s;peak home as the Dr. oes&mdash;Indeed I cannot but think, it would be $uch better for all Sides, if they would all &s;peak out
<PB N="6" REF="5">
plainly, and without Di&s;gui&s;e&mdash;Then the World would know what they mean&mdash;They would no need <HI>to be put upon</HI> by any more SHORTEST WAYS, and &s;uch Phanatical Tricks, to explain thei$ meaning&mdash;The Dr. has been one, <HI>you &s;ee,</HI> tha Dares <HI>be Hone&s;t,</HI> and &s;peak what he thinks.</P>
<P>Next I &s;ay what the Dr. has &s;aid in this Sermon was mo&s;t Sea&s;onable; and to this I may join th$ Heads I had &s;eparated, <HI>(viz.)</HI> U&s;eful, Profitable, &amp;c. and to make it out, I &s;hall Enquire how it is <HI>Sea&s;on|able, &V;&s;eful,</HI> and <HI>Profitable.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Under the&s;e Two Heads, I &s;hall go near to An|&s;wer all your Objections, again&s;t the Reveren Dr's Sermon, and con&s;equently Convince you, hope, that you were very much in the wrong, t$ Remark upon &s;o Excellent a Di&s;cour&s;e and e&s;pecial|ly to give it &s;uch hard Words, as <HI>Malignant</HI> an$ <HI>Pe&s;tilent.</HI></P>
<P>And really, Sir, the&s;e Words are very Offen&s;ive to a great many hone&s;t good People; for that the$ think you very much wrong the Dr. <HI>to Sugge&s;t</HI> tha$ he &s;hould Infect any Body; or that <HI>any thing</HI> he $word$ Learnedly &s;ays, &s;hould have the lea&s;t SPREADING Malignity&mdash;but of this hereafter.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> Sir, and I doubt no I <HI>&s;ay</HI> to make appear that&mdash;what the Reverend Dr has &s;aid of them, is both <HI>&V;&s;eful, Sea&s;onable,</HI> and <HI>Pro|fitable</HI> to them,&mdash;and indeed plain Dealing is u&s;e|ful both to Friend and Enemy&mdash;but e&s;pecially to Enemies, for then they knowwhat they are to tru&s;$ to&mdash;'Tis like the K. of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Declaration be|fore
<PB N="7" REF="6">
his Expedition into <HI>Schonen,</HI> it tells the <HI>Swedes</HI> what they are to expect&mdash;Now the Dr. has ho|ne&s;tly told the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters, what they are to expect</HI> from him, and his Party; he has <HI>Drawn the Sword</HI> at them, and they know their Enemy&mdash;and have no more to do, but to prepare for their own De|fence.</P>
<P>But <HI>you will &s;ay,</HI> how is this made <HI>Profitable</HI> to them; it is <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to a Man to know an Enemy, and it may be <HI>&s;ea&s;onable</HI> to him to have that Enemy di&s;|covered to him; but it cannot be profitable to any Man to have an Enemy at all?</P>
<P><HI>No, No, Sir,</HI> I do not &s;ay it is profitable to have an Enemy; but it is always profitable to a Man, or Party of Men, when they have Enemies to have tho&s;e Enemies <HI>Di&s;tracted,</HI> and <HI>Raving;</HI> for that Rage entirely deprives them of the Power of acting, takes away the u&s;e of their Rea&s;on and gives a ma|nife&s;t Advantage again&s;t them.</P>
<P>'Tis the Subtile, Smiling, Fawning, Wheedling, Cautious Enemy, that is the <HI>Dangerous Enemy;</HI> the Furious, Ha&s;ty, Precipitant Enemy, always Splits him&s;elf upon the Rocks of his own Pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;and Throws his Cau&s;e down the Precipice of his own Rage&mdash;This is the Way the <HI>Revelution Princi|pale,</HI> and the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in this King|dom has always been E&s;tabli&s;ht&mdash;and this is the Way they will &s;till be fa&s;ter, and fa&s;ter fixt, in their pre&s;ent Liberty: You are &s;o mi&s;taken, Sir, in thinking that Dr. <HI>Sacheveral</HI> has Injur'd the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters;</HI> That upon my Word, I think he has done them mo&s;t Signal Services all along&mdash;I wi&s;h you would Con&s;ider of one thing, which really is worth your while&mdash;I wi&s;h it does not appear that this Sermon is another of <HI>DeFoe</HI>'s SHORTEST
<PB N="8" REF="7">
WAYS, and that the Dr. is in a Plot with the Pha|naticks, to make the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> appear O|dious, and Hateful to the World.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, <HI>to Illu&s;trate this Thought,</HI> will you be plea&s;ed to look back a little, <HI>as I know you are a Ma|&s;ter of Hi&s;tory,</HI> and do but &s;ee, how very recent Tran&s;actions, will Confirm the Truth of what I a&s;|&s;ert&mdash;<HI>viz.</HI> that Precipitations have always fixt the Intere&s;t they would De&s;troy, and been the Ruin of the Precipitators.</P>
<P>I need not carry you Back, to Books and Records, tho' our Hi&s;tories are full of Precedents; every Man's Memory will Furni&s;h him &s;ufficient to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Time <HI>Deliberation,</HI> Policy; Wheedling, Bribing, and <HI>Gradual Encroachments,</HI> How did they In&s;en&s;ibly De&s;troy us?&mdash;How had they Imperceptibly Debauch'd the very Principles of Liberty in the Nation? As they had al&s;o tho&s;e of Morality; and had tho&s;e Mea&s;ures gone on, <HI>we had been Ruin'd</HI>&mdash;But when King <HI>James</HI> came to the Crown, He hone&s;tly undeceived us, told us plainly what he meant, what he aim'd at, and what indeed all his Ance&s;tors had aim'd at, <HI>(viz.) En&s;laving us</HI>&mdash;And this Ruin'd the Party; had King <HI>James</HI> with the Fraud, and Policy of his Elder Brother, gone on clo&s;ely, and &s;oftly, we had all been Ruin'd, and for ought I know, <HI>even Popery it &s;elf</HI> might have gone down with us&mdash;But thanks be to God, and the King, they took the contrary Method&mdash;<HI>Like the Reverend</HI> Dr Sacheverl, HONEST and PLAIN; they &s;hew'd us the whole Plot&mdash;<HI>And what then?</HI>&mdash;Why then, <HI>it cea&s;ed to be a Plot</HI>&mdash;and the whole Nation rou&s;ed to Dethrone him, <HI>that they might be &s;afe:</HI> They Precipitated their King, their
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Popery, their Tyranny, altogether, and threw them Headlong down the Steep Gulph of the Re|volution.</P>
<P><HI>Come we to the pre&s;ent Reign,</HI> in the beginning they had her Maje&s;ties Favour, their good Mi&s;tre&s;s Indulg'd them, prompted their Zeal for the Church, and gave them the Publick Admini&s;tration into their Hands; hoping for the Honour and Safety of their Benefactor, they would have gone on <HI>Mildly</HI> and <HI>Gently</HI>&mdash;and had they done &s;o but a while, they might have carried all before them&mdash;But how did they Mi&s;take her Maje&s;ties Word <HI>Zeal,</HI> for Per&s;ecution?&mdash;How did they refu&s;e their Occa|&s;ional Bill when offered them by the Lords with <HI>but one Amendiment</HI>&mdash;Which they would have been glad of afterwards How did they then Pre|cipitat their &s;econd <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill, which &s;till Increa&s;|ed the Oppo&s;ition</HI>&mdash;Nor could they ever retrieve the fir&s;t Point, <HI>which they ra&s;hly lo&s;t,</HI> till at la&s;t, they da&s;h'd it in pieces again&s;t the Privileges of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Did not Precipitations &s;ave the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in this Ca&s;e?&mdash;Were the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> able to do any thing for them&s;elves? Did not the&s;e State Lunaticks do it all for them?&mdash;Why then &s;hould any <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> be Angry when he &s;ees High-Church-men, <HI>Run|ning Mad?</HI> Has it not always been their Safety? Has it not always lo&s;t the High-Church Cau&s;e, when the other have been perfectly Pa&s;&s;ive, and done nothing for them&s;elves?&mdash;Let them rave Gentlemen, it certainly prompts the Fever, and &s;uch People always <HI>Die Mad.</HI></P>
<P>They tell us a Story, of a Party of <HI>Round-head</HI> Soldiers, who were &s;urprized by a Party of <HI>Cavali|ers,</HI> and being overpower'd, were like to be wor&s;ted&mdash;The King's Men Attackt them with the&s;e <HI>Vile</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<HI>Expre&s;&s;ions, Damn you, Rebel Dog</HI>'s, now <HI>where</HI>'s <HI>your</HI> LORD OF HOSTS: The Officer that Command|ed the Round Heads hearing it, turns to his Men, cries a loud&mdash;<HI>The Day</HI>'s <HI>our own, Boys, the Ene|my</HI> BLASPHEME&mdash;Which &s;o Daunted the o|thers, and Encouraged his own Men, that he Beat them pre&s;ently out of the Field, tho he was great|ly Inferiour in Number.</P>
<P>Do the <HI>High flyers</HI> Rave, do they Bla&s;pheme, never be Troubled at that; then the <HI>Day is your own;</HI> Precipitations, and Helli&s;h Excur&s;ions mu&s;t ruin them; <HI>it ever did do &s;o,</HI> and ever will do &s;o.</P>
<P>If I were a Whig therefore, <HI>as you are Sir,</HI> I would Compliment my Brother <HI>Sacheveral,</HI> upon his doing &s;o much Service to that Intere&s;t, and give him publcik Thanks for it; for without que&s;|tion they are exceedingly Obliged to him.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is an Age of Plot and Deceit, of <HI>Con|tradiction</HI> and <HI>Paradox;</HI> and the Nation can hard|ly know her Friends from her Enemies; Men Swearing to the Government, and wi&s;hing it over|turn'd; <HI>Abjuring</HI> the Pretender, yet earne&s;tly en|deavouring <HI>to bring him in;</HI> Eating the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Bread, and <HI>Cur&s;eing the Donor;</HI> owning the <HI>Succe&s;|&s;ion,</HI> and wi&s;hing the Succe&s;&s;ors <HI>at the Devil;</HI> mak|ing the Marriage (UNION) yet endeavouring <HI>the Divorce;</HI> fawning upon the <HI>Toleration,</HI> yet Rail|ing at <HI>the Liberty</HI>&mdash;It is very hard, under all the&s;e Masks, to &s;ee the true Countenance of any Man&mdash;There are more kinds of Hypocri&s;ie, than that of <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI>&mdash;and the whole Town &s;eems to look on Way, and row another: Is it not then an advantage, to be Valued, and Prized; and are you not obliged to the Per&s;on, <HI>tho' an Ene|my,</HI> when Openly and Honourably Men throw off
<PB N="11" REF="10">
their Di&s;gui&s;es, and tell us what they are, and what they mean?&mdash;<HI>Such Men,</HI> tho' they are indeed Malignant, and Pe&s;tilential as you call them, in their Nature, yet they cea&s;e to be SPREADING, and the Danger is evited by their &s;etting out their Lights, and giving notice to all People to &s;tand up|on their Guard again&s;t them, to &s;hun and avoid the Contagion.</P>
<P>Secondly for the Church <HI>of</HI> England.</P>
<P>It is very evident, the main End of all the Di&s;|gui&s;es the&s;e People put on, re&s;pecting the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> is more particularly to deceive &amp; delude the Mem|bers <HI>of the Church of England</HI>&mdash;Who are of more moderate Principles, to amu&s;e them with Zeal for the Churches Intere&s;t, and pre&s;wade them, that they only &s;eek ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Re&s;traints <HI>upon the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and that they may be prevented, bring|ing <HI>the Church into Danger</HI>&mdash;That they are not for abridging them of a Con&s;cientious Liberty, or for re&s;training them from the Wor&s;hip of God <HI>their own way,</HI> but only for checking <HI>unlimited Toleration</HI> and cru&s;hing their pernicious <HI>Occ$&s;ional Hypocri&s;ie</HI> and the like; and this Mask of Charity and pre|tended Care of the Church, really deceives a great many hone&s;t, well meaning People of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who in their hone&s;t Concern for the Church, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the Rea&s;onablne&s;s of the&s;e Demands, <HI>fall in with them,</HI> from meer Prin|ciples of Zeal for Religion, and Self pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Now, are we not infinitly oblig'd to Dr. <HI>Saceve|rel</HI> who throws off this Mask, and fairly tels the&s;e impos'd-upon Gentlemen, what it is they really mean, rather than what they pretend&mdash;Will it not go a great Way to open the Eyes of the&s;e hone&s;t Church-Men, <HI>think you,</HI> and will they not be ea&s;ily convinced? We have often told them
<PB N="12" REF="11">
in vain, that the Safety of the Church, and the re|&s;training Hypocri&s;ie were but Pretences of the Par|ty, but that the real De&s;ign was <HI>Hanging and Drowning, the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and &s;ending both Mini|&s;ters and People to the GALLOWS and the GAL|LEYS&mdash;And they would not believe us&mdash;POOR <HI>DE FOE</HI> with his <HI>Shorte&s;t Way,</HI> how did they u&s;e him, for fathering &s;uch a thing upon them, and making the World believe, that <HI>High Flyers</HI> had &s;uch bloody De&s;igns? But, <HI>&s;ure thy will believe now they have it from the Pulpit,</HI> from the very Mouth of the Oracle of that Party, and Preach'd up as an indi&s;pen&s;able Duty to <HI>draw the Sword</HI> a|gain&s;t the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>&mdash;Now they cannot fay they are <HI>&s;landred:</HI> But it is their profe&s;s'd Principle to de&s;troy the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> both Body and Soul&mdash;He owns the De&s;ign, he &s;ummons the Magi&s;trates to <HI>draw the Sword</HI> on them, the Clergy to <HI>cur&s;e them</HI>&mdash;And from the Pulpit he dooms them <HI>to the De|vil and his Angels,</HI> that they may not want Com|pany.</P>
<P><HI>Hone&s;tly done, Sir in Truth:</HI> And mo&s;t unju&s;tly it is that you cen&s;ure him&mdash;<HI>A mo&s;t obliging Thing,</HI> and the be&s;t Step the Reverend Dr. could have ta|ken, to bring the World to an <HI>Eclairci&s;ment</HI> in the Matter of <HI>High Church</HI> De&s;igns&mdash;Now all the moderate Men, all the Men of Principles and Cha|rity, <HI>in the Church of</HI> England&punc; may &s;ee whither they were going, and what their warmer Brethren were driving them to under Pretence of the Churches Safety&mdash;They may &s;ee here, what her Maje&s;ty <HI>ca&s;t the&s;e People off</HI> for, why the Rever|end Prelates of the Church abandon'd them&mdash;Alas, the Queen did not care to have two Mill|ons of her People deliver'd up <HI>to Di&s;truction</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="12">
The Bi&s;hops could not think, <HI>without Horrour,</HI> of &s;ending two Millions of their Brethren, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Faith, believing in the &s;ame Saviour, and re&s;ting on the &s;ame Hope, <HI>to the Devil and his An|gels</HI>&mdash;And now all the moderate concientious People in the Church, <HI>who abhor the&s;e Principles,</HI> will be convinc'd of the De&s;ign, and by Con&s;e|quence abhor the People.</P>
<P>Wherefore I entreat you Sir, recall your Satyri|cal Remarks, and make &s;ome hand&s;ome Apology to the Reverend Doctor for mal-treating him&mdash;And when you have done, be plea&s;ed to addre&s;s him in the mo&s;t obliging Manner po&s;&s;ible, with humble and hearty Thanks&mdash;And le&s;t you &s;hould think your &s;elf alone in the &s;olemn Acknow|ledgment, you have hereby a Commi&s;&s;ion &s;ent you to give him Thanks in the Name of Abundance of People; fir&s;t for his Sermon in General, and then for &s;everal of the Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Sir, You are to thank him in the Name of the <HI>High Flying</HI> Clergy of the Church, for &s;o bold|ly &s;peaking from the Pulpit, what they all mean, tho they have not had Courage to expre&s;s it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of all the <HI>Jaco|bites</HI> in the Nation, for &s;o evidently clearing up their Mode&s;ty, and proving, that the Danger of <HI>Britain</HI> lies not in the profe&s;s'd <HI>Non-Juror</HI>&mdash;but in the Allegiance-&s;wearing, Abjuration-taking <HI>High Flyers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of all the Mo|derate <HI>Church-men,</HI> for having fairly disbanded them from his Regiment, and acknowledg'd, they are not at all concerned in his Bloody Principles.</P>
<P><HI>Fourtly</HI> Thank him in the Name of all the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters,</HI> for his abundant Charity, in dooming them
<PB N="14" REF="13">
all to the Devil and his Angels&mdash;But above all, for <HI>leaving them there,</HI> as he &s;ays he will; &s;ince cer|tainly had he re&s;olved to go with them, he would have been the greate&s;t Cur&s;e of the Company.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of the Queen-for calling the Union a Mongrel, which is in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> mode&s;tly &s;peaking a Son of a B&mdash;;&s;ince all People, to the Honour of Her Maje&s;ty, know well enough, who was the Mother of the Union.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of the Church of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;for calling her Whore, &s;ince he &s;ays, Archbi&s;hop <HI>Grindal</HI> was one of her Ba&s;tards&mdash;For Fal&s;e Sons mu&s;t be under&s;tood, as you &s;ay to be Ba&s;tards, and not Sons.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly</HI> Thank him in the Name of the Bi&s;hops, for his charitable Cen&s;ure of them, and is wonder|ful, mannerly, and obedient Command to them, to excommunicate all the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters-</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eightly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of the Parlia, ment who have tolerated Trea&s;on by Law&mdash;&s;ince, he &s;ays all that di&s;&s;ent from the Church are Tray|tors to the State.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of all the Re|verend Clergy of the Church, for making a <HI>Biling&s;|gate</HI> of the Pulpit, and &s;etting St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cathedral on Fire.</P>
<P><HI>Tenthly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks in <HI>England,</HI> for &s;o kindly inverting the Order of the Day, and dropping the <HI>Gun-Powder</HI> Plot, a Subject &s;o ungrateful to them, to employ the Day upon &s;o much more &s;uitable a Subject&mdash;<HI>Viz.</HI> The real Blowing up the Peace of Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I pre&s;ume, you will give the Doctor an Equivalent for the Affront he received at the Court of Aldermen, and he may tell tho&s;e

<P>And after all this, what will you &s;ay to the&s;e Men, and why &s;hould you think &s;trange of their Manner of Proceeding?&mdash;Alas, Sir, you need make no wonder at all of it, you have it plainly ex|pre&s;s'd, and the Rea&s;on of it annex'd, Revel. 12. 12. <HI>The Devil is come down in great Rage, becau&s;e he knows his Time is &s;hort</HI>&mdash;The&s;e Things all tend to the Advantage of our E&s;tabli&s;hment, and are as u&s;eful as Poi&s;ons in Phy&s;ick&mdash;Little Clamours may cha&s;e and fret the Government, but loud Noi&s;e will awaken&mdash;Murmurs and Di&s;conttents form a Party, and Words are like private Cabals&mdash;And with the&s;e a Government of ten bears and &s;its &s;till&mdash;But when the Drum beats, Ju&s;tice rouzes, and Powers begins to u&s;e its Hands</P>
