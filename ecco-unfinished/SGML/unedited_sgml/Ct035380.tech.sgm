<P>THE following INTERLUDE was
prepared for the Stage, merely
with a View of a&s;&s;i&s;ting Mrs.
<HI>Pritchard</HI> at her Benefit; and the De&s;ire
of &s;erving &s;o good an Actre&s;s, is a better
Excu&s;e for its Defects, than the few
Days in which it was written, and repre|&s;ented.
Notwith&s;tanding the favourable
Reception it has met with, the Author
would not have printed it, had not his
Friend, Mr. <HI>Hogarth,</HI> flattered him mo&s;t
agreeably, by thinking <HI>The Farmer and
his Family</HI> not unworthy of a Sketch of
his Pencil. To Him, therefore, this
Trifle, which he has &s;o much honoured,
is in&s;cribed, as a faint Te&s;timony of the
&s;incere E&s;teem which the Writer bears
him, both as a <HI>Man</HI> and an <HI>Arti&s;t.</HI></P>
