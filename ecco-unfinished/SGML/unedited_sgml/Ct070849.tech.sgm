<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PReaching of Sermons is Speaking to a
few of Mankind: Printing of Books
is Talking to the whole World. The Par|&s;on
Pre&s;cribes him&s;elf, and addre&s;&s;es to the
particular Auditory with the Appellation of
<HI>My Brethren;</HI> but he that Prints a Book,
ought to Preface it with a <HI>Noverint Uni|ver&s;i,</HI>
Know all Men by the&s;e Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>The proper Inference drawn from this re|markable
Ob&s;ervation, is, That tho' he that
Preaches from the Pulpit ought to be careful
of his Words, that nothing pa&s;s from him
but with an e&s;pecial Sanction of Truth;
yet he that Prints and Publi&s;hes to all the
World, has a tenfold Obligation.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
The Sermon is a Sound of Words &s;poken
to the Ear, and prepar'd only for pre&s;ent
Meditation, and extends no farther than the
&s;trength of Memory can convey it; a Book
Printed is a Record, remaining in every
Man's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, always ready to renew its
Acquaintance with his Memory, and always
ready to be produc'd as an Authority or Vou|cher
to any Reports he makes out of it, and
conveys its Contents for Ages to come, to the
Eternity of mortal Time, when the Author
is forgotten in his Grave.</P>
<P>If a Sermon be ill grounded, if the Prea|cher
impo&s;es upon us, he tre&s;pa&s;&s;es on a few;
but if a Book Printed obtrudes a Fal&s;hood,
if a Man tells a Lye in Print, he abu&s;es
Mankind, and impo&s;es upon the whole World,
he cau&s;es our Children to tell Lyes after us,
and their Children after them, to the End of
the World.</P>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation I thought good to make
by way of Preface, to let the World know,
that when I go about a Work in which I mu&s;t
tell a great many Stories, which may in their
own nature &s;eem incredible, and in which I
mu&s;t expect a great part of Mankind will
<PB REF="4">
que&s;tion the Sincerity of the Relator; I did
not do it without a particular &s;ence upon me
of the proper Duty of an Hi&s;torian, and the
abundant Duty laid on him to be very wary
what he conveys to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I cannot be &s;o ignorant of my own Intenti|ons,
as not to know, that in many Ca&s;es I
&s;hall act the Divine, and draw nece&s;&s;ary pra|ctical
Inferences from the extraordinary Re|markables
of this Book, and &s;ome Digre&s;&s;i|ons
which I hope may not be altogether u&s;ele&s;s
in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And while I pretend to a thing &s;o &s;olemn,
I cannot but premi&s;e I &s;hould &s;tand convicted
of a double Impo&s;ture, to forge a Story, and
then preach Repentance to the Reader from a
Crime greater than that I would have him re|pent
of: endeavouring by a Lye to correct
the Reader's Vices, and &s;in again&s;t Truth to
bring the Reader off from &s;inning again&s;t
Sence.</P>
<P>&V;pon this &s;core, tho' the &V;ndertaking be
very difficult among &s;uch an infinite variety
of Circum&s;tances, to keep exactly within the
bounds of Truth; yet I have this po&s;itive
A&s;&s;urance with me, that in all the &s;ub&s;equent
<PB REF="5">
Relation, if the lea&s;t Mi&s;take happen, it &s;hall
not be mine.</P>
<P>If I judge right, 'Tis the Duty of an Hi|&s;torian
to &s;et every thing in its own Light,
and to convey matter of fact upon its legiti|mate
Authority, and no other: I mean thus,
(for I wou'd be as explicit as I can) That
where a Story is vouch'd to him with &s;ufficient
Authority, he ought to give the World the
&s;pecial Te&s;timonial of its proper Voucher, or
el&s;e he is not ju&s;t to the Story: and where it
comes without &s;uch &s;ufficient Authority, he
ought to &s;ay &s;o; otherwi&s;e he is not ju&s;t to
him&s;elf. In the fir&s;t Ca&s;e he injures the Hi|&s;tory,
by leaving it doubtful where it might
be confirm'd pa&s;t all manner of que&s;tion; in
the la&s;t he injures his own Reputation, by
taking upon him&s;elf the Ri&s;que, in ca&s;e it
proves a Mi&s;take, of having the World charge
him with a Forgery.</P>
<P>And indeed, I cannot but own 'tis ju&s;t,
that if I tell a Story in Print for a Truth
which proves otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s I, at the &s;ame
time, give proper Caution to the Reader, by
owning the &V;ncertainty of my Knowledge in
<PB REF="6">
the matter of fact, 'tis I impo&s;e upon the
World; my Relater is innocent, and the Lye
is my own.</P>
<P>I make all the&s;e preliminary Ob&s;ervations,
partly to inform the Reader, that I have not
undertaken this Work without the &s;erious
Con&s;ideration of what I owe to Truth, and
to Po&s;terity; nor without a Sence of the ex|traordinary
Variety and Novelty of the Rela|tion.</P>
<P>I
am &s;en&s;ible, that the want of this Cauti|on
is the Foundation of that great Misfor|tune
we have in matters of ancient Hi&s;tory;
in which the Impudence, the Ribaldry, the
empty Flouri&s;hes, the little Regard to Truth,
and the Fondne&s;s of telling a &s;trange Story,
has dwindled a great many valuable Pieces
of ancient Hi&s;tory into meer Romance.</P>
<P>How are the Lives of &s;ome of our mo&s;t
famous Men, nay the Actions of whole Ages,
drowned in Fable? Not that there wanted
Pen-men to write, but that their Writings
were continually mixt with &s;uch Rhodomon|tades
of the Authors that Po&s;terity rejected
them as fabulous.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
From hence it comes to pa&s;s that Matters
of Fact are handed down to Po&s;terity with
&s;o little Certainty, that nothing is to be de|pended
upon; from hence the uncertain Ac|count
of Things and Actions in the remoter
Ages of the World, the confounding the Ge|nealogies
as well as Atchievements of <HI>Belus,
Nimrod,</HI> and <HI>Nimrus,</HI> and their Succe&s;|&s;ors,
the Hi&s;tories and Originals of <HI>Saturn
Jupiter,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Cele&s;tial
Rabble, who Mankind would have been a|&s;ham'd
to have call'd <HI>Gods,</HI> had they had
the true Account of their di&s;&s;olute, exorbitant,
and inhumane Lives.</P>
<P>From Men we may de&s;cend to Action: and
this prodigious Loo&s;ene&s;s of the Pen has con|founded
Hi&s;tory and Fable from the begin|ning
of both. Thus the great Flood in <HI>Deu|calion</HI>'s
Time is made to pa&s;s for the &V;ni|ver&s;al
Deluge: the Ingenuity of <HI>Dedalus,</HI>
who by a Clue of Thread got out of the <HI>Egy|ptian</HI>
Maze, which was thought impo&s;&s;ible,
is grown into a Fable of making him&s;elf a
pair of Wings, and flying through the Air:&mdash;the
great Drought and violent Heat of Sum|mer,
thought to be the Time when the Great
<PB REF="8">
Famine was in <HI>Samaria,</HI> fabl'd by the Poets
and Hi&s;torians into the Story of <HI>Phaeton</HI>
borrowing the Chariot of the Sun, and giving
the Hor&s;es their Heads, they run &s;o near the
Earth as burnt up all the neare&s;t Parts, and
&s;corch'd the Inhabitants, &s;o that they have
been black in tho&s;e Parts ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch like ridiculous Stuff, have
been the Effects of the Pageantry of Hi&s;tori|ans
in former Ages: and I might de&s;cend
nearer home, to the Legends of Fabulous Hi|&s;tory
which have &s;wallow'd up the Actions of
our a $ient Predece&s;&s;ors, King <HI>Arthur,</HI> the
Gyant <HI>Gogmagog,</HI> and the <HI>Britain,</HI> the
Stories of St. <HI>George</HI> and the <HI>Dragon, Guy</HI>
Earl of <HI>Warwick, Bevis</HI> of <HI>Southamp|ton,</HI>
and the like.</P>
<P>I'll account for better Conduct in the en&s;u|ing
Hi&s;tory: and tho' &s;ome Things here re|lated
&s;hall have equal Wonder due to them,
Po&s;terity &s;hall not have equal Occa&s;ion to di&s;|tru&s;t
the Verity of the Relation.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s here is room for abundance of
Romance, becau&s;e the Subject may be &s;afer
extended than in any other ca&s;e, no Story being
capable to be crowded with &s;uch Circum&s;tan|ces,
<PB REF="9">
but Infinite Power, which is all along
concern'd with us in every Relation, is &s;up|pos'd
capable of making true.</P>
<P>Yet we &s;hall no where &s;o Tre&s;pa&s;s upon
Fact, as to oblige Infinite Power to the &s;hew|ing
more Miracles than it intended.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allow'd, That when Nature
was put into &s;o much Confu&s;ion, and the Sur|face
of the Earth and Sea felt &s;uch extraordi|nary
a Di&s;order, innumerable Accidents would
fall out that till the like Occa&s;ion happen may
never more be &s;een, and unle&s;s a like Occa&s;ion
had happen'd could never before be heard of:
wherefore the particular Circum&s;tances being
&s;o wonderful, &s;erve but to remember Po&s;teri|ty
of the more wonderful Extreme, which was
the immediate Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The &V;&s;es and Application made from this
Terrible Doctrine, I leave to the Men of the
Pulpit; only take the freedom to ob&s;erve, that
when Heaven it &s;elf lays down the Doctrine,
all Men are &s;ummon'd to make Applications
by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The main Inference I &s;hall pretend to make
or at lea&s;t venture the expo&s;ing to publick
View, in this ca&s;e, is, the &s;trong Evidence
<PB REF="10">
God has been pleas'd to give in this terrible
manner to his own Being, which Mankind
began more than ever to affront and de&s;pi&s;e:
And I cannot but have &s;o much Charity for
the wor&s;t of my Fellow-Creatures, that I be|lieve
no Man was &s;o hard'ned again&s;t the
Sence of his Maker, but he felt &s;ome Shocks
of his wicked Confidence from the Convul&s;ions
of Nature at this time.</P>
<P>I cannot believe any Man &s;o rooted in A|thei&s;tical
Opinions, as not to find &s;ome Cau&s;e
to doubt whether he was not in the Wrong,
and a little to apprehend the Po&s;&s;ibility of a
Supreme Being, when he felt the terrible Bla&s;ts
of this Tempe&s;t. I cannot doubt but the A|thei&s;t's
hard'ned Soul trembl'd a little as well
as his Hou&s;e, and he felt &s;ome Nature asking
him &s;ome little Que&s;tions; as the&s;e&mdash;<HI>Am not
I mi&s;taken? Certainly there is &s;ome &s;uch
thing as a God&mdash;What can all this be?
What is the Matter in the World?</HI></P>
<P>Certainly Athei&s;m is one of the mo&s;t Irra|tional
Principles in the World; there is &s;ome|thing
incongruous in it with the Te&s;t of Hu|mane
Policy, becau&s;e there is a Ri&s;que in the
Mi&s;take one way, and none another. If the
<PB REF="11">
Chri&s;tian is mi&s;taken, and it &s;hould at la&s;t ap|pear
that there is no Future State, God or
Devil, Reward or Puni&s;hment, where is the
Harm of it? All he has lo&s;t is, that he has
practis'd a few needle&s;s Mortifications, and
took the pains to live a little more like a Man
than he wou'd have done. But if the Athei&s;t
is mi&s;taken, he has brought all the Powers,
who&s;e Being he deny'd, upon his Back, has
provok'd the Infinite in the highe&s;t manner,
and mu&s;t at la&s;t &s;ink under the Anger of him
who&s;e Nature he has always di&s;own'd.</P>
<P>I would recommend this Thought to any
Man to con&s;ider of, one Way he can loo&s;e
nothing, the other he may be undone. Cer|tainly
a wi&s;e Man would never run &s;uch an
unequal Ri&s;que: a Man cannot an&s;wer it to
Common Arguments, the Law of Numbers,
and the Rules of Proportion are again&s;t him.
No Game&s;ter will &s;et at &s;uch a Main; no
Man will lay &s;uch a Wager, where he may
lo&s;e, but cannot win.</P>
<P>There is another unhappy Misfortune in
the Mi&s;take too, that it can never be di&s;co|ver'd
till'tis too late to remedy. He that re|&s;olves
to die an Athei&s;t, &s;huts the Door a|gain&s;t
being convinc'd in time.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">
If it &s;hou'd &s;o fall out, as who can tell,
But that there is a God, a Heaven, and
Hell,
Mankind had be&s;t con&s;ider well for Fear,
't &s;hould be too late when his Mi&s;takes
appear.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not pretend to &s;et up for an In|&s;tructor
in this Ca&s;e, were not the Inference
&s;o exceding ju&s;t; who can but preach where
there is &s;uch a Text? when God him&s;elf
&s;peaks his own Power, he expects we &s;hould
draw ju&s;t Inferences from it, both for our
Selves and our Friends.</P>
<P>If one Man, in an Hundred Years, &s;hall
arrive at a Conviction of the Being of his
Maker, 'tis very well worth my While to write
it, and to bear the Character of an imperti|nent
Fellow from all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I thought to make &s;ome Apology for the
Meanne&s;s of Stile, and the Method, which
may be a little unu&s;ual, of Printing Letters
from the Country in their own Stile.</P>
<P>For the la&s;t I only leave this &s;hort Rea&s;on
with the Reader, the De&s;ire I had to keep
<PB REF="13">
clo&s;e to the Truth, and hand my Relation with
the true Authorities from whence I receiv'd it,
together with &s;ome Ju&s;tice to the Gentlemen
concern'd, who, e&s;pecially in Ca&s;es of Delive|rances,
are willing to record the Te&s;timonial
of the Mercies they received, and to &s;et their
Hands to the humble Acknowledgment. The
Plainne&s;s and Hone&s;ty of the Story will plead
for the Meanne&s;s of the Stile in many of the
Letters, and the Reader cannot want Eyes to
&s;ee what &s;ort of People &s;ome of them come
from.</P>
<P>Others &s;peak for them&s;elves, and being
writ by Men of Letters, as well as Men of
Principles, I have not Arrogance enough to
attempt a Correction either of the Sen&s;e or
Stile; and if I had gone about it, &s;hould
have injur'd both Author and Reader.</P>
<P>The&s;e come dre&s;&s;ed in their own Words be|cau&s;e
I ought not, and tho&s;e becau&s;e I could not
mend 'em. I am per&s;waded, they are all dre&s;s'd
in the de&s;irable, though unfa&s;nionable Garb
of Truth, and I doubt not but Po&s;terity will
read them with Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen, who have taken the Pains
to collect and tran&s;mit the Particular Relations
<PB REF="14">
bere made pubick, I hope will have their End
an&s;wered in this E&s;&s;ay, conveying hereby to
the Ages to come the Memory of the dreadfule&s;t
and mo&s;t univer&s;al Judgment that ever Al|mighty
Power thought fit to bring upon this
Part of the World.</P>
<P>And as this was the true Native and Ori|ginal
De&s;ign of the fir&s;t &V;ndertaking, ab&s;tra|cted
from any Part of the Printer's Advan|tage,
the Editor and &V;ndertakers of this
Work, having their Ends entirely an&s;wer'd,
hereby give their humble Thanks to all tho&s;e
Gentlemen who have &s;o far approv'd the Sin|cerity
of their De&s;ign as to contribute their
Trouble, and help forward by their ju&s;t Ob|&s;ervations,
the otherwi&s;e very difficult &V;nder|taking.</P>
<P>If
Po&s;terity will but make the de&s;ired Im|provement
both of the Collector's Pains, as
well as the &s;everal Gentlemens Care in furni&s;h|ing
the Particulars, I dare &s;ay they will all

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Natural Cau&s;es and Original of Winds.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH a Sy&s;tem of Exhalation,
Dilation, and Exten&s;ion, things
which the Ancients founded the Do|ctrine
of Winds upon, be not my di|rect
Bu&s;ine&s;s; yet it cannot but be needful to
the pre&s;ent De&s;ign to Note, that the Difference
in the Opinions of the Ancients, about the Na|ture
and Original of Winds, is a Leading Step to
one A&s;&s;ertion which I have advanc'd in all that
I have &s;aid with Relation to Winds, <HI>viz.</HI> That
there &s;eems to be more of God in the whole
Appearance, than in any other Part of Ope|rating
Nature.</P>
<P>Nor do I think I need explain my &s;elf very
far in this Notion: I allow the high Origi|nal
<PB N="2" REF="16">
of Nature to be the Great Author of
all her Actings, and by the &s;trict Rein of his
Providence, is the Continual and Exact Guide
of her Executive Power; but &s;till 'tis plain
that in Some of the Principal Parts of Nature
&s;he is Naked to our Eye, Things appear both
in their Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences, Demon|&s;tration
gives its A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and fini&s;hes our
further Enquiries: for we never enquire after
God in tho&s;e Works of Nature which depend|ing
upon the Cour&s;e of Things are plain and
demon&s;trative; but where we find Nature de|fective
in her Di&s;covery, where we &s;ee Effects
but cannot reach their Cau&s;es; there 'tis mo&s;t
ju&s;t, and Nature her &s;elf &s;eems to direct us to
it, to end the rational Enquiry, and re&s;olve
it into Speculation: Nature plainly refers us
beyond her Self, to the Mighty Hand of Infi|nite
Power, the Author of Nature, and Ori|ginal
of all Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e Arcana of the Sovereign Oe|conomy,
the Winds are laid as far back as any.
Tho&s;e Ancient Men of Genius who rifled Na|ture
by the Torch-Light of Rea&s;on even to
her very Nudities, have been run a-ground in
this unknown Channel; the Wind has blown
out the Candle of Rea&s;on, and left them all
in the Dark.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> in his Problems, Sect. 23. calls the
Wind <HI>Aeris Impul&s;um. Seneca</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Ventus e&s;t

<P>This is what I quote them for, and this is
all my Argument demands; the deepe&s;t Search

has found out ju&s;t enough to leave the wi&s;e&s;t
Philo&s;opher in the dark, to bewilder his Head,
and drown his Under&s;tanding. You rai&s;e
a Storm in Nature by the very Inquiry; and
at la&s;t, to be rid of you, &s;he confe&s;&s;es the
Truth, and tells you, <HI>It is not in Me, you mu&s;t
go Home and ask my Father.</HI></P>
<P>Whether then it be the Motion of Air, and
what that Air is, <HI>which as yet is underfin'd,</HI> whe|ther
it is a Dilation, a previous Contraction,
and then violent Exten&s;ion as in Gun-Powder,
whether the Motion is Direct, Circular, or Ob|lique,
whether it be an Exhalation repuls'd by
the Middle Region, and the Antiperi&s;ta&s;is

and keep it within its proper Compa&s;s for the
Functions of Re&s;piration Conden&s;ing and
Rarifying, without which Nature would be
all in Confu&s;ion; whatever are their efficient
Cau&s;es, 'tis not much to the immediate De&s;ign.</P>
<P>'Tis apparent, that God Almighty, whom the
Philo&s;ophers care as little as po&s;&s;ible to have
any thing to do with, &s;eems to have re&s;erv'd
this, as one of tho&s;e Secrets in Nature which
&s;hould more directly guide them to him&s;elf.</P>

for 'twas Pity there &s;hould lie any ju&s;t Ex|ceptions
to the Piety of a Man, who had &s;o
few to his General Knowledge, and an exal|ted
Spirit in Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>When therefore I &s;ay the Philo&s;ophers do
not care to concern God him&s;elf in the Search
after Natural Knowledge; I mean, as it con|cerns
Natural Knowledge, <HI>meerly as &s;uch;</HI> for
'tis a Natural Cau&s;e they &s;eek, from a General
Maxim, That all Nature has its Cau&s;e within
it &s;elf: 'tis true, 'tis the Darke&s;t Part of the
Search, to trace the Chain backward; to begin
at the Con&s;equence, and from thence <HI>hunt
Counter,</HI> as we may call it, to find out the
Cau&s;e: 'twould be much ea&s;ier if we could
begin at the Cau&s;e, and trace it to all its Con|&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="19">
I make no Que&s;tion, the Search would be
equally to the Advantage of Science, and the
Improvement of the World; for without
Doubt there are &s;ome Con&s;equences of known
Cau&s;es which are not yet di&s;cover'd, and I am
as ready to believe there are yet in Nature
&s;ome <HI>Terra Incognita</HI> both as to Cau&s;e and
Con&s;equence too.</P>
<P>In this Search after Cau&s;es, the Philo&s;o|pher,
tho' he may at the &s;ame Time be a very
good Chri&s;tian, cares not at all to meddle
with his Maker: the Rea&s;on is plain; We
may at any time re&s;olve all things into Infinite
Power, and we do allow that the Finger of
Infinite is the Fir&s;t Mighty Cau&s;e of Nature
her &s;elf: but the Trea&s;ury of Immediate Cau&s;e
is generally committed to Nature; and if at
any Time we are driven to look beyond her, 'tis
becau&s;e we are out of the way: 'tis not be|cau&s;e
it is not in her, but becau&s;e we cannot
find it.</P>
<P>Two Men met in the Middle of a great
Wood; One was &s;earching for a Plant which
grew in the Wood, the Other had lo&s;t him|&s;elf
in the Wood, and wanted to get out:
The Latter rejoyc'd when thro' the Trees he
&s;aw the open Country; but the Other Man's
Bu&s;ine&s;s was not to get out, but to find what
he look'd for: yet this Man no more under|valued
the Plea&s;antne&s;s of the Champion
Country than the other.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="20">
Thus in Nature the Philo&s;opher's Bu&s;ine&s;s
is not to look through Nature, and come to
the va&s;t open Field of Infinite Power; his
Bu&s;ine&s;s is in the Wood; there grows the
Plant he looks for; and 'tis there he mu&s;t find
it. Philo&s;ophy's a-ground if it is forc'd to
any further Enquiry. The Chri&s;tian begins
ju&s;t where the Philo&s;opher ends; and when
the Enquirer turns his Eyes up to Heaven,
Farewel Philo&s;opher; 'tis a Sign he can make
nothing of it here.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> was a good Man, the Scripture gives
him that Te&s;timony; but I am of the Opini|on,
he was a better King than a Scholar, more
a Saint than a Philo&s;opher: and it &s;eems very
proper to judge that <HI>David</HI> was upon the Search
of Natural Cau&s;es, and found him&s;elf puzzled
as to the Enquiry, when he fini&s;hes the En|quiry
with two pious Ejaculations, <HI>When I view
the Heavens the Works of thy Hands, the Moon
and the Stars which thou ha&s;t made; then I &s;ay,
what is Man! David</HI> may very rationally
be &s;uppos'd to be &s;earching the Cau&s;es, Mo|tions,
and Influences of Heavenly Bodies;
and finding his Phyilo&s;ophy a-ground, and
the Di&s;covery not to an&s;wer his Search, he
turns it all to a pious U&s;e, recognizes Infinite
Power, and applies it to the Ex&s;ta&s;ies and
Raptures of his Soul, which were always em|ploy'd
in the Charm of exalted Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus in another Place we find him diffecting
the Womb of his Mother, and deep in the
<PB N="7" REF="21">
Study of Anatomy; but having as it may be
well &s;uppo&s;ed, no Help from <HI>Johan Remelini,</HI>
or of the Learned <HI>Riolanus,</HI> and other Ana|tomi&s;ts,
famous for the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Di&s;co|very
of human Body, and all the Ve&s;&s;els of
Life, with their proper Dimen&s;ions and U&s;e,
all <HI>David</HI> could &s;ay to the Matter was, <HI>Good
Man,</HI> to look up to Heaven, and admire what
he could not under&s;tand, <HI>P&s;al.&mdash;I was
fearfully and wonderfully made,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This is very Good, and well becomes a Pul|pit;
but what's all this to a Philo&s;opher? 'Tis
not enough for him to know that God has
made the Heavens, the Moon, and the
Stars, but mu&s;t inform him&s;elf where he has
plac'd them, and why there; and what their
Bu&s;ine&s;s, what their Influences, their Functi|ons,
and the End of their Being. 'Tis not
enough for an Anatomi&s;t to know that he is
fearfully and wonderfully made in the lower|mo&s;t
Part of the Earth, but he mu&s;t &s;ee tho&s;e
lowermo&s;t Parts; &s;earch into the Method Na|ture
proceeds upon in the performing the Of|fice
appointed, mu&s;t &s;earch the Steps &s;he takes,
the Tools &s;he works by; and in &s;hort, know
all that the God of Nature has permitted to
be capable of Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems a ju&s;t Authority for our
Search, that &s;ome things are &s;o plac'd in Na|ture
by a Chain of Cau&s;es and Effects, that
upon a diligent Search we may find out what
we look for: To &s;earch after what God has
<PB N="8" REF="22">
in his Sovereignty thought fit to conceal,
may be criminal, and doubtle&s;s is &s;o; and the
Fruitle&s;ne&s;s of the Enquiry is generally Part
of the Puni&s;hment to a vain Curio&s;ity: but
to &s;earch after what our Maker has not hid,
only cover'd with a thin Veil of Natural Ob|&s;curity,
and which upon our Search is plain
to be read, &s;eems to be ju&s;tified by the very
Nature of the thing, and the Po&s;&s;ibility of the
Demon&s;tration is an Argument to prove the
Lawfulne&s;s of the Enquiry.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign of this Digre&s;&s;ion, is, in
&s;hort, That as where Nature is plain to be
&s;earch'd into, and Demon&s;tration ea&s;y, the
Philo&s;opher is allow'd to &s;eek for it; &s;o where
God has, as it were, laid his Hand upon any
Place, and Nature pre&s;ents us with an univer|&s;al
Blank, we are therein led as naturally to
recognize the Infinite Wi&s;dom and Power of
the God of Nature, as <HI>David</HI> was in the Texts
before quoted.</P>
<P>And this is the Ca&s;e here; the Winds are
&s;ome of tho&s;e In&s;crutables of Nature, in which
humane Search has not yet been able to arrive
at any Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>&startq;The Winds, <HI>&s;ays the Learned Mr.</HI> Bohun,
are generated in the Intermediate Space be|tween
the Earth and the Clouds, either by
Rarefaction or Repletion, and &s;ometimes
haply by pre&s;&s;ure of Clouds Ela&s;tical Vir|tue
of the Air, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the Earth or Seas,
as by Submarine or Subterraneal Eruption or
<PB N="9" REF="23">
De&s;cen&s;ion or Re&s;ilition from the middle
Region.&endq;</P>
<P>All this, though no Man is more capable
of the Enquiry than this Gentleman, yet to
the Demon&s;tration of the thing, amounts to
no more than what we had before, and &s;till
leaves it as Ab&s;tru&s;e and Cloudy to our Un|der&s;tanding
as ever.</P>
<P>Not but that I think my &s;elf bound in Du|ty
to Science in General, to pay a ju&s;t Debt to
the Excellency of Philo&s;ophical Study, in
which I am a meer Junior, and hardly any
more than an Admirer; and therefore I can|not
but allow that the Demon&s;trations made
of Rarefaction and Dilatation are extraordi|nary;
and that by Fire and Water Wind may
be rais'd in a clo&s;e Room, as the Lord <HI>Ve|rulam</HI>
made Experiment in the Ca&s;e of his Fea|thers.</P>
<P>But that therefore all the Cau&s;es of Wind
are from the Influences of the Sun upon va|porous
Matter fir&s;t Exhal'd, which being Di|lated
are oblig'd to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of more
Space than before, and con&s;equently make the
Particles fly before them; this does not &s;eem
to be a &s;ufficient Demon&s;tration of Wind:
for this, to my weak Apprehen&s;ion, would
rather make a Blow like Gun-Powder than a
ru&s;hing forward; at be&s;t this is indeed a
probable Conjecture, but admits not of De|mon&s;tration
equal to other Phaenomena in
Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="24">
And this is all I am upon, <HI>viz.</HI> That this
Ca&s;e has not equal Proofs of the Natural Cau|&s;es
of it that we meet with in other Ca&s;es:
The Scripture &s;eems to confirm this, when it
&s;ays in one Place, <HI>He holds the Wind in his
Hand;</HI> as if he &s;hould mean, Other things are
left to the Common Di&s;coveries of Natural
Inquiry, but this is a thing he holds in his
own Hand, and has conceal'd it from the Search
of the mo&s;t Diligent and Piercing Under&s;tand|ing:
This is further confirm'd by the Words
of our Saviour, <HI>The Wind blows where it li&s;t|eth,
and thou heare&s;t the Sound thereof, but
knowe&s;t not whence it cometh;</HI> 'tis plainly ex|pre&s;s'd
to &s;ignify that the Cau&s;es of the Wind
are not equally di&s;cover'd by Natural Enquiry
as the re&s;t of Nature is.</P>
<P>If I would carry this Matter on, and travel
into the Seas, and Mountains of <HI>America,</HI>
where the Man&s;ones, the Trade-Winds, the
Sea-Breezes, and &s;uch Winds as we have little
Knowledge of, are more common; it would
yet more plainly appear, <HI>That me hear the
Sound, but know not from whence they come.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is the Cau&s;e of their Motion parallel
to the Surface of the Earth, a le&s;s My&s;tery
than their real Original, or the Difficulty of
their Generation: and though &s;ome People
have been forward to prove the Gravity of
the Particles mu&s;t cau&s;e the Motion to be ob|lique;
'tis plain it mu&s;t be very little &s;o, or
el&s;e Navigation would be impracticable, and
<PB N="11" REF="25">
in extroardinary Ca&s;es where the Pre&s;&s;ure a|bove
is perpendicular, it has been fatal to
Ships, Hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and would have terrible
Effects in the World, if it &s;hould more fre|quently
be &s;o.</P>
<P>From this I draw only this Conclu&s;ion, That
the Winds are a Part of the Works of God
by Nature, in which he has been plea&s;ed to
communicate le&s;s of Demon&s;tration to us than
in other Ca&s;es; that the Particulars more di|rectly
lead us to Speculations, and refer us to
Infinite Power more than the other Parts of
Nature does.</P>
<P>That the Wind is more expre&s;&s;ive and
adapted to his Immediate Power, as he is
pleas'd to exert it in extraordinary Ca&s;es in
the World.</P>
<P>That 'tis more frequently made u&s;e of as
the Executioner of his Judgments in the
World, and extraordinary Events are brought
to pa&s;s by it.</P>
<P>From the&s;e three Heads we are brought
down directly to &s;peak of the Particular Storm
before us; <HI>viz.</HI> The Greate&s;t, the Longe&s;t in
Duration, the wide&s;t in Extent, of all the
Tempe&s;ts and Storms that Hi&s;tory gives any
Account of &s;ince the Beginning of Time.</P>
<P>In the further Conduct of the Story, 'twill
not be foreign to the Purpo&s;e, nor unprofita|ble
to the Reader, to review the Hi&s;tories of
ancient Time and remote Countries, and exa|mine
in what Manner God has been pleas'd to
<PB N="12" REF="26">
execute his Judgments by Storms and Tem|pe&s;ts;
what kind of things they have been,
and what the Con&s;equences of them; and
then bring down the Parallel to the Dreadful
In&s;tance before us.</P>
<P>We read in the Scripture of Two Great
Storms; One pa&s;t, and the Other to come.
Whether the la&s;t be not Allegorical rather
than Prophetical, I &s;hall not bu&s;ie my &s;elf to
determine.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t was when God cau&s;ed a &s;trong
Wind to blow upon the Face of the Delug'd
World; to put a &s;top to the Flood, and re|duce
the Waters to their proper Channel.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h our Naturali&s;ts would explain that
Wind to us, and tell us which way it blew,
or how it is po&s;&s;ible that any direct Wind
could cau&s;e the Waters to ebb; for to me it
&s;eems, that the Deluge being univer&s;al, that
Wind which blew the Waters from one Part
mu&s;t blow them up in another.</P>
<P>Whether it was not &s;ome perpendicular
Gu&s;ts that might by their Force &s;eparate the
Water and the Earth, and cau&s;e the Water
driven from off the Land to <HI>&s;ub&s;ide</HI> by its own
Pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>I &s;hall dive no farther into that my&s;terious
Deluge, which has &s;ome things in it which
recommend the Story rather to our Faith than
Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>The Other Storm I find in the Scripture is
in the <HI>God &s;hall rain upon the Wick|ed,
<PB N="13" REF="27">
Plagues, Fire, and a horrible Tempe&s;t.</HI> What
this &s;hall be, we wait to know; and happy
are they who &s;hall be &s;ecured from its Effects.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tories are full of In&s;tances of violent
Tempe&s;ts and Storms in &s;undry particular Pla|ces.
What that was, which mingled with
&s;uch violent Lightnings &s;et the Cities of <HI>So|dom</HI>
and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> on fire, remains to me yet
undecided: nor am I &s;atisfied the Effect it had
on the Waters of the Lake, which are to this

<P>The real Occa&s;ion I &s;uppo&s;e thus: That
before the Multitude and Indu&s;try of Inhabi|tants
prevail'd to the managing, enclo&s;ing,
and improving the Country, the va&s;t Tract of
Land in this I&s;land which continually lay
open to the Flux of the Sea, and to the Inun|dations
of Land-Waters, were as &s;o many
&s;tanding Lakes; from whence the Sun conti|nually
exhaling va&s;t quantities of moi&s;t Va|pours,
the Air could not but be continually
crowded with all tho&s;e Parts of nece&s;&s;ary Mat|ter
to which we a&s;cribe the Original of Winds,
Rains, Storms, and the like.</P>
<P>He that is acquainted with the Situation of
<HI>England,</HI> and can reflect on the va&s;t Quanti|ties
of flat Grounds, on the Banks of all our
navigable Rivers, and the Shores of the Sea,
which Lands at lea&s;t lying under Water every
Spring-Tide, and being thereby continually
full of moi&s;ture, were like a &s;tagnated &s;tand|ing
body of Water brooding Vapours in the
Interval of the Tide, mu&s;t own that at lea&s;t a

<P>Such horrid Apprehen&s;ions tho&s;e Ages had

the Prodigy to which Navigation in particu|lar,
and Sciential Knowledge in general, is &s;ince
grown, appear very ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="34">
For we find no Danger in our Shores, no un|certain
wavering in our Tides no frightful Gulfs,
no horrid Mon&s;ters, but what the bold Mariner
has made familiar to him. The Gulfs which
frighted tho&s;e early Sons of <HI>Neptune</HI> are &s;earch'd
out by our Seamen, and made u&s;eful Bays,
Roads, and Harbours of Safety. The Pro|montories
which running out into the Sea
gave them terrible Apprehen&s;ions of Danger,
are our Safety, and make the Sailors Hearts
glad, as they are the fir&s;t Lands they make
when they are coming Home from a long Voy|age,
or as they are a good &s;helter when in a
Storm our Ships get <HI>under their Lee.</HI></P>
<P>Our Shores are founded, the Sands and Flats
are di&s;covered, which they knew little or no|thing
of, and in which more real Danger lies,
than in all the frightful Stories they told us;
u&s;eful Sea-marks and Land-figures are plac'd on
the Shore, Buoys on the Water, Light-hou&s;es
on the highe&s;t Rocks; and all the&s;e dreadful
Parts of the World are become the Seat of
Trade, and the Centre of Navigation: Art has
reconcil'd all the Difficulties, and U&s;e made
all the <HI>Horribles</HI> and <HI>Terribles</HI> of tho&s;e Ages
become as natural and familiar as Day-light.</P>
<P>The Hidden Sands, almo&s;t the only real
Dread of a Sailor, and by which till the Chan|nels
between them were found out, our Ea&s;tern
Coa&s;t mu&s;t be really unpa&s;&s;able, now &s;erve
to make Harbours: and <HI>Yar mouth</HI> Road was
made a &s;afe Place for Shipping by them. Nay,
<PB N="21" REF="35">
when <HI>Port&s;mouth, Plymouth,</HI> and other good
Harbours would not defend our Ships in the
Violent Tempe&s;t we are treating of, here was
the lea&s;t Damage done of any Place in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
con&s;idering the Number of Ships
which lay at Anchor, and the Openne&s;s of
the Place.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole it &s;eems plain to
me, that all the di&s;mal things the Ancients
told us of <HI>Britain,</HI> and her terrible Shores, a|ro&s;e
from the Infancy of Marine Knowledge,
and the Weakne&s;s of the Sailor's Courage.</P>
<P>Not but that I readily allow we are more
&s;ubject to bad Weather and hard Gales of
Wind than the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> and
<HI>Barbary:</HI> But if this be allow'd, our Improve|ment
in the Art of Building Ships is &s;o con&s;i|derable,
our Ve&s;&s;els are &s;o prepar'd to ride out
the mo&s;t violent Storms, that the Fury of
the Sea is the lea&s;t thing our Sailors fear:
Keep them but from <HI>a Lee Shore,</HI> or touching
upon a Sand, they'll venture all the re&s;t: and
nothing is a greater &s;atisfaction to them, if
they have a Storm in view, than a found Bot|tom
and good <HI>Sea-room.</HI></P>
<P>From hence it comes to pa&s;s, that &s;uch
Winds as in tho&s;e Days wou'd have pa&s;s'd for
Storms, are called only a <HI>Fre&s;h-gale,</HI> or <HI>Blow|ing
hard.</HI> If it blows enough to fright a
South Country Sailor, we laugh at it: and if
our Sailors bald Terms were &s;et down in a
Table of Degrees, it will explain what we
mean.</P>

<P>Ju&s;t half the&s;e Tarpawlin Articles, I pre|&s;ume,
would have pa&s;s'd in tho&s;e Days for a
Storm; and that our Sailors call a Top-&s;ail
Gale would have drove the Navigators of tho&s;e
Ages into Harbours: when our Sailors reif a
Top-&s;ail, they would have handed all their
Sails; and when we go under a main Cour&s;e,
they would have run <HI>afore it</HI> for Life to the
next Port they could make: when our <HI>Hard

be all at their Prayers.</P>
<P>And if we &s;hould reckon by this Account
we are a &s;tormy Country indeed, our Seas are
no more Navigable now for &s;uch Sailors than
they were then: If the <HI>Japane&s;es,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t

great Ships with which he fought the Battle
of <HI>Acti$$$s,</HI> were to come upon our Seas, there
hardly comes a <HI>March</HI> or a <HI>September</HI> in twenty
Years but would blow them to Pieces, and
then the poor Remnant that got Home, would
<PB N="23" REF="37">
go and talk of a terrible Country where there's
nothing but Storms and Tempe&s;ts; when all
the Matter is, the Weakne&s;s of their Shipping,
and the Ignorance of their Sea-men: and I
make no que&s;tion but our Ships ride out many
a wor&s;e Storm than that terrible Tempe&s;t
which &s;catter'd <HI>Julius C$&s;ar</HI>'s Fleet, or the
&s;ame that drove <HI>Aeneas</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Car|thage.</HI></P>
<P>And in more modern times we have a fa|mous
In&s;tance in the <HI>Spani&s;h Armada;</HI> which,
after it was rather frighted than damag'd by
Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s Machines, not then known
by the Name of Fire&s;hips, were &s;catter'd by a
terrible Storm, and lo&s;t upon every Shore.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is plain, 'Twas all owing to the Ac|cident
of Navigation: They had, no doubt, a
hard Gale of Wind, and perhaps a Storm; but
they were al&s;o on an Enemy's Coa&s;t, their Pilots
out of their Knowledge, no Harbour to run in|to,
and an Enemy a-&s;tern, that when once they
&s;eparated, Fear drove them from one Danger to
another, and away they went to the North|ward,
where they had nothing but God's
Mercy, and the Winds and Seas to help them.
In all tho&s;e Storms and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es which ruin'd
that Fleet, we do not find an Account of the
Lo&s;s of one Ship, either of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or
<HI>Dutch;</HI> the Queen's Fleet rode it out in the
<HI>Downs,</HI> which all Men know is none of the
be&s;t Roads in the World; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> rode
among the Flats of the <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, while
<PB N="24" REF="38">
the va&s;t Galleons, not &s;o well fitted for the
Weather, were forc'd to keep the Sea, and
were driven to and fro till they had got out
of their Knowledge; and like Men de&s;perate,
embrac'd every Danger they came near.</P>
<P>This long Digre&s;&s;ion I could not but think
needful, in order to clear up the Ca&s;e, having
never met with any thing on this Head be|fore:
At the &s;ame time 'tis allow'd, and Hi|&s;tories
are full of the Particulars, that we have
often very high Winds, and &s;ometimes vio|lent
Tempe&s;ts in the&s;e Northen Parts of the

Tempe&s;t never happen'd before as that which
is the Subject of the&s;e Sheets: and I refer the

and that &s;o hard, that we thought it terrible

Weather: Several Stacks of Chimnies were
blown down, and &s;everal Ships were lo&s;t,
and the Tiles in many Places were blown off
from the Hou&s;es; and the nearer it came to
the fatal <HI>26th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> the Tempe&s;tuou&s;|ne&s;s
of the Weather encreas'd.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning before, being
the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> it was fair Weather,
and blew hard; but not &s;o as to give any Ap|prehen&s;ions,
till about 4 a Clock in the Af|ternoon
the Wind encrea&s;ed, and with Squauls
of Rain and terrible Gu&s;ts blew very fu|riou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The
Collector of the&s;e Sheets narrowly
e&s;cap'd the Mi&s;chief of a Part of a Hou&s;e,
which fell on the Evening of that Day by the
Violence of the Wind; and abundance of
Tiles were blown off the Hou&s;es that Night:
the Wind continued with unu&s;ual Violence
all the next Day and Night; and had not
the Great Storm follow'd &s;o &s;oon, this had
pa&s;s'd for a great Wind.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday</HI> Morning it continued to blow
exceeding hard, but not &s;o as that it gave any
Apprehen&s;ions of Danger within Doors; to|wards

P. 1530. as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A Letter from the Reverend Mr. William
Derham, F.R.S. Containing his Ob&s;er|vations
concerning the late Storm.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to my Promi&s;e at the general
Meeting of the <HI>R. S.</HI> on St. <HI>Andrews</HI>
Day, I here &s;end you inclos'd the Account of
my Ingenious and Inqui&s;itive Friend <HI>Richard
Townely,</HI> E&s;&abque; concerning the State of the At|mo&s;phere
in that Part of <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> where
he liveth, in the late di&s;mal Storm. And I
hope it will not be unaccepable, to accom|pany
his with my own Ob&s;ervations at <HI>&V;p|min&s;ter;</HI>
e&s;pecially &s;ince I &s;hall not weary you
with a long Hi&s;tory of the Deva&s;tations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
but rather &s;ome Particulars of a more Philo|&s;ophical
Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="41">
And fir&s;t, I do not think it improper to
look back to the preceding Sea&s;ons of the
Year. I &s;carce believe I &s;hall go out of the
way, to reflect as far back as <HI>April, May, June</HI>
and <HI>July;</HI> becau&s;e all the&s;e were wet Months
in our Southern Parts. In <HI>April</HI> there fell
12, 49 <HI>l.</HI> of Rain through my Tunnel: And
about 6, 7, 8, or 9, <HI>l.</HI> I e&s;teem a moderate quan|tity
for <HI>&V;pmin&s;ter. In</HI> May <HI>there fell more
than in any Month of any Year &s;ince the Year</HI>
1696, viz. 20, 77 l. l. <HI>June</HI> likewi&s;e was a drip|ping
Month, in which fell 14, 55 <HI>l.</HI> And
<HI>July,</HI> although it had con&s;iderable Intermi&s;&s;i|ons,
yet had 14, 19 <HI>l.</HI> above 11 <HI>l.</HI> of which
fell on <HI>July 28th</HI> and <HI>29th</HI> in violent Showers.
And I remember the News Papers gave Ac|counts
of great Rains that Month from divers
Places of <HI>Europe;</HI> but the <HI>North of England</HI>
(which al&s;o e&s;caped the Violence of the late
Storm) was not &s;o remarkably wet in any of
tho&s;e Months; at lea&s;t not in that great pro|portion
more than we, as u&s;ually they are; as
I gue&s;s from the Tables of Rain, with which
Mr. <HI>Towneley</HI> hath favoured me. Particularly
<HI>July</HI> was a dry Month with them, there being
no more than 3, 65 <HI>l.</HI> of Rain fell through Mr.
<HI>Towneley</HI>'s Tunnel of the &s;ame Diameter with
mine.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Months let us pa&s;s to <HI>September,</HI>
and that we &s;hall find to have been a wet
Month, e&s;pecially the latter part of it;
there fell of Rain in that Month, 14, 86 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="42">
<HI>October</HI> and <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, although not re|markably
wet, yet have been open warm
Months for the mo&s;t part. My Thermometer
(who&s;e freezing Point is about 84) hath been
very &s;eldom below 100 all this Winter, and
e&s;pecially in <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have laid before you as &s;hort Ac|count
as I could of the preceding Di&s;po&s;ition
of the Year, particularly as to wet and warmth,
becau&s;e I am of opinion that the&s;e had a great
Influence in the late Storm; not only in cau|&s;ing
a Repletion of Vapours in the Atmo|&s;phere,
but al&s;o in rai&s;ing &s;uch Nitro-&s;ulphu|reous
or other heterogeneous matter, which
when mix'd together might make a &s;ort of
Explo&s;ion (like fired Gun-powder) in the
Atmo&s;phere. And from this Explo&s;ion I judge
tho&s;e Corru&s;cations or Fla&s;hes in the Storm to
have proceeded, which mo&s;t People as well
as my &s;elf ob&s;erved, and which &s;ome took for
Lightning. But the&s;e things I leave to better
Judgments, &s;uch as that very ingenious
Member of our Society, who hath undertaken
the Province of the late Tempe&s;t; to whom,
if you plea&s;e, you may impart the&s;e Papers;
Mr. <HI>Hall$y</HI> you know I mean.</P>
<P>From Preliminaries it is time to proceed
nearer to the Tempe&s;t it &s;elf. And the fore|going
Day, <HI>viz. Thur&s;day, Nov.</HI> 25. I think de|&s;erveth
regard. In the Morning of that day
was a little Rain, the Winds high in the After|noon&punc;
S.B.E. and S. In the Evening there was
<PB N="29" REF="43">
Lightning; and between 9 and 10 of the
Clock at Night, a violent, but &s;hort Storm of
Wind, and much Rain at <HI>&V;pmin&s;ter;</HI> and of Hail
in &s;ome other Places, which did &s;ome Damage:
There fell in that Storm 1, 65 <HI>l.</HI> of Rain. The
next Morning, which was <HI>Friday, Novem.</HI> 26.
the Wind was S.S.W. and high all Day, and
&s;o continued till I was in Bed and a&s;leep. A|bout
12 that Night, the Storm awaken'd me,
which gradually encreas'd till near 3 that
Morning; and from thence till near 7 it con|tinued
in the greate&s;t exce&s;s: and then began
&s;lowly to abate, and the <HI>Mercury</HI> to ri&s;e &s;wift|ly.
The Barometer I found at 12 h. 1/2 P. M.
at 28, 72, where it continued till about 6 the
next Morning, or 6 1/4, and then ha&s;tily ro&s;e;
&s;o that it was gotten to 82 about 8 of the
Clock, as in the Table.</P>
<P>How the Wind &s;at during the late Storm I
cannot po&s;itively &s;ay, it being exce&s;&s;ively dark
all the while, and my Vane blown down al&s;o,
when I could have &s;een: But by Information
from Millers, and others that were forc'd to
venture abroad; and by my own gue&s;s, I
imagin it to have blown about S. W. by S. or
nearer to the S. in the beginning, and to veer
about towards the We&s;t towards the End of
the Storm, as far as W. S. W.</P>
<P>The degrees of the Wind's Strength being
not mea&s;urable (that I know of, though talk'd
of) but by gue&s;s, I thus determine, with re|&s;pect
to other Storms. On <HI>Feb.</HI> 7. 169 8/9. was
<PB N="30" REF="44">
a terrible Storm that did much damage. This
I number 10 degrees; the Wind then W.N.W.
<HI>vid. Ph. Tr. No.</HI> 262. Another remarkable
Storm was <HI>Feb.</HI> 3. 170 &Venus;. at which time was
the greate&s;t de&s;cent of the $ ever known:
This I number 9 degrees. But this la&s;t of
<HI>November,</HI> I number at lea&s;t 15 degrees.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Stations</HI> of the <HI>Barometer,</HI> you
have Mr. <HI>Towneley</HI>'s and mine in the following
Table to be &s;een at one View.</P>
<P>As to <HI>November 17th</HI> (whereon Mr. <HI>Towne|ley</HI>
mentions a violent Storm in <HI>Oxford&s;hire</HI>)
it was a Stormy Afternoon here at <HI>Upmin&s;ter,</HI>
accompanied with Rain, but not violent, nor
&Venus; very low. <HI>November 11th</HI> and <HI>12th</HI> had
both higher Winds and more Rain; and the
&Venus; was tho&s;e Days lower than even in the la&s;t
Storm of <HI>November 26th.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have given you the true&s;t Ac|count
I can, of what I thought mo&s;t to de&s;erve
Ob&s;ervation, both before, and in the late
Storm. I could have added &s;ome other par|ticulars,
but that I fear I have already made
my Letter long, and am tedious. I &s;hall there|fore
only add, that I have Accounts of the
Violence of the Storm at <HI>Norwich, Beccles,
Sudbury, Colche&s;ter, Rochford,</HI> and &s;everal o|ther
intermediate places; but I need not tell
Particulars, becau&s;e I que&s;tion not but you
have better Informations.</P>

with the People the next Days, under|&s;tood,
mo&s;t People expected the Fall of their
Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>And yet in this general Apprehen&s;ion, no
body dur&s;t quit their tottering Habitations;
for whatever the Danger was within doors,
'twas wor&s;e without; the Bricks, Tiles, and
Stones, from the Tops of the Hou&s;es, flew
with &s;uch force, and &s;o thick in the Streets,
that no one thought $it to venture out, tho'
their Hou&s;es were near demoli&s;h'd within.</P>
<P>The Author of this Relation was in a well|built
brick Hou&s;e in the skirts of the City;
and a Stack of Chimneys falling in upon the
next Hou&s;es, gave the Hou&s;e &s;uch a Shock,
that they thought it was ju&s;t coming down
upon their Heads: but opening the Door to
attempt an E&s;cape into a Garden, the Danger
was &s;o apparent, that they all thought fit to
&s;urrender to the Di&s;po&s;al of Almighty Provi|dence,
and expect their Graves in the Ruins of
the Hou&s;e, rather than to meet mo&s;t certain De|&s;truction
in the open Garden: for unle&s;s they
cou'd have gone above two hundred Yards
from any Building, there had been no Securi|ty;
for the Force of the Wind blew the Tiles
point-blank, tho' their weight inclines them
downward: and in &s;everal very broad Streets,
we &s;aw the Windows broken by the flying of
Tile-&s;herds from the other &s;ide: and where
there was room for them to fly, the Author
of this has &s;een Tiles blown from a Hou&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="47">
above thirty or forty Yards, and &s;tuck from
five to eight Inches into the &s;olid Earth. Pie|ces
of Timber, Iron, and Sheets of Lead, have
from higher Buildings been blown much far|ther;
as in the Particulars hereafter will ap|pear.</P>
<P>It
is the receiv'd Opinion of abundance of
People, that they felt, during the impetuous
fury of the Wind, &s;everal Movements of the
Earth; and we have &s;everal Letters which af|firm
it: But as an Earthquake mu&s;t have been
&s;o general, that every body mu&s;t have di&s;|cern'd
it; and as the People were in their
Hou&s;es when they imagin'd they felt it, the
Shaking and Terror of which might deceive
their Imagination, and impo&s;e upon their
Judgment; I &s;hall not venture to affirm it was
&s;o: And being re&s;olv'd to u&s;e &s;o much Cau|tion
in this Relation as to tran&s;mit nothing
to Po&s;terity without authentick Vouchers, and
&s;uch Te&s;timony as no rea&s;onable Man will di&s;|pute;
&s;o if any Relation come in ourway, which
may afford us a Probability, tho' it may be
related for the &s;ake of its Strangene&s;s or No|velty,
it &s;hall neverthele&s;s come in the Com|pany
of all its Uncertainties, and the Reader
left to judge of its Truth: for this Account
had not been undertaken, but with de&s;ign to
undeceive the World in fal&s;e Relations, and
to give an Account back'd with &s;uch Autho|rities,
as that the Credit of it &s;hou'd admit of
no Di&s;putes.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="48">
For this rea&s;on I cannot venture to affirm
that there was any &s;uch thing as an Earth|quake;
but the Concern and Con&s;ternation of
all People was &s;o great, that I cannot wonder
at their imagining &s;everal things which were
not, any more than their enlarging on things
that were, &s;ince nothing is more frequent,
than for Fear to double every Object, and
impo&s;e upon the Under&s;tanding, &s;trong Ap|prehen&s;ions
being apt very often to per&s;wade
us of the Reality of &s;uch things which we
have no other rea&s;ons to &s;hew for the proba|bility
of, than what are grounded in tho&s;e
Fears which prevail at that juncture.</P>
<P>Others thought they heard it thunder. 'Tis
confe&s;s'd, the Wind by its unu&s;ual Violence
made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the Air as had a re&s;em|blance
to Thunder; and 'twas ob&s;erv'd, the
roaring had a Voice as much louder than u&s;u|al,
as the Fury of the Wind was greater than
was ever known: the Noi&s;e had al&s;o &s;ome|thing
in it more formidable; it &s;ounded aloft,
and roar'd not very much unlike remote Thun|der.</P>
<P>And
yet tho' I cannot remember to have
heard it thunder, or that I &s;aw any Lightning,
or heard of any that did in or near <HI>London;</HI>
yet in the Countries the Air was &s;een full of
Meteors and vaporous Fires: and in &s;ome pla|ces
both Thundrings and unu&s;ual Fla&s;hes of
Lightning, to the great terror of the Inhabi|tants.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="49">
And yet I cannot but ob&s;erve here, how
fearle&s;s &s;uch People as are addicted to Wicked|ne&s;s,
are both of God's Judgments and uncom|mon
Prodigies; which is vi&s;ible in this Parti|cular,
That a Gang of hardned Rogues a&s;&s;aulted
a Family at <HI>Poplar,</HI> in the very Height of the
Storm, broke into the Hou&s;e, and robb'd them:
it is ob&s;ervable, that the People cryed Thieves,
and after that cryed Fire, in hopes to rai&s;e the
Neighbourhood, and to get &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance;
but &s;uch is the Power of Self-Pre&s;ervation, and
&s;uch was the Fear, the Minds of the People were
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with, that no Body would venture
out to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Family,
who were rifled and plundered in the middle
of all the Extremity of the Tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>It would admit of a large Comment here,
and perhaps not very unprofitable, to examine
from what &s;ad Defect in Principle it mu&s;t be that
Men can be &s;o de&s;titute of all manner of Re|gard
to invi&s;ible and &s;uperiour Power, to be
acting one of the vil$&s;t Parts of a Villain,
while infinite Power was threatning the whole
World with Di&s;olation, and Multitudes of Peo|ple
expected the La&s;t-Day was at Hand.</P>
<P>Several Women in the City of <HI>London</HI> who
were in Travail, or who fell into Travail by
the Fright of the Storm, were oblig'd to run
the ri&s;que of being delivered with &s;uch Help
as they had; and Midwives found their own
Lives in &s;uch Danger, that few of them
thought them&s;elves oblig'd to &s;hew any Con|cern
for the Lives of others.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="50">
Fire was the only Mi&s;chief that did not
happen to make the Night compleatly dread|ful;
and yet that was not &s;o every where, for
in <HI>Norfolk</HI> the Town of&mdash;was almo&s;t ruin'd
by a furious Fire, which burnt with &s;uch Ve|hemence,
and was &s;o fann'd by the Tempe&s;t,
that the Inhabitants had no Power to concern
them&s;elves in the extingui&s;hing it; the Wind
blew the Flames, together with the Ruines,
&s;o about, that there was no &s;tanding near it;
for if the People came to Windward they were
in Danger to be blown into the Flames; and
if to Leward the Flames were &s;o blown up in
their Faces, they could not bear to come near it.</P>
<P>If this Di&s;ta&s;ter had happen'd in <HI>London,</HI>
it mu&s;t have been very fatal; for as no regu|lar
Application could have been made for the
extingui&s;hing it, &s;o the very People in Dan|ger
would have had no Opportunity to have
&s;av'd their Goods, and hardly their Lives:
for though a Man will run any Ri&s;que to
avoid being burnt, yet it mu&s;t have been next
to a Miracle, if any Per&s;on &s;o oblig'd to e&s;|cape
from the Flames had e&s;cap'd being
knock'd on the Head in the Streets; for the
Bricks and Tiles flew about like &s;mall Shot;
and 'twas a mi&s;erable Sight, in the Morning
after the Storm, to &s;ee the Streets covered with
Tyle-&s;herds, and Heaps of Rubbi&s;h, from the
Tops of the Hou&s;es, lying almo&s;t at every Door.</P>
<P>From Two of the Clock the Storm conti|nued,
and encrea&s;ed till Five in the Morning;
<PB N="37" REF="51">
and from Five, to half an Hour after Six, it
blew with the greate&s;t Violence: the Fury of
it was &s;o exceeding great for that particular
Hour and half, that if it had not abated as it
did, nothing could have &s;tood its Violence
much longer.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t Part of the Time the greate&s;t
Part of the Damage was done: Several Ships
that rode it out till now, gave up all; for no
Anchor could hold. Even the Ships in the
River of <HI>Thames</HI> were all blown away from
their Moorings, and from <HI>Execution-Dock</HI> to
<HI>Lime-Hou&s;e Hole</HI> there was but four Ships that
rid it out, the re&s;t were driven down into the
<HI>Bite,</HI> as the Sailors call it, from <HI>Bell-Wharf</HI> to
<HI>Lime-Hou&s;e;</HI> where they were huddeld toge|ther
and drove on Shore, Heads and Sterns,
one upon another, in &s;uch a manner, as any
one would have thought it had been impo&s;&s;i|ble:
and the Damage done on that Account
was incredible.</P>
<P>Together with the Violence of the Wind,
the Darkne&s;s of the Night added to the Ter|ror
of it; and as it was ju&s;t New Moon, the
Spring Tides being then up at about Four a
Clock, made the Ve&s;&s;els, which were a float
in the River, drive the farther up upon the
Shore: of all which, in the Proce&s;s of this
Story, we &s;hall find very &s;trange In&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Points from whence the Wind blew,
are variou&s;ly reported from various Hands:
'Tis certain, it blew all the Day before at
<PB N="38" REF="52">
S.W. and I thought it continued &s;o till about
Two a Clock; when, as near as I could judge
by the Impre&s;&s;ions it made on the Hou&s;e, for
we dur&s;t not look out, it veer'd to the S.S.W.
then to the W. and about Six a Clock to
W. by N. and &s;till the more Northward it
&s;hifted, the harder it blew, till it &s;hifted again
Southerly about Seven a Clock; and as it did
&s;o, it gradually abated.</P>
<P>About Eight a Clock in the Morning it cea|&s;ed
&s;o much, that our Fears were al&s;o abated,
and People began to peep out of Doors; but
'tis impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Concern that ap|pear'd
in every Place: the Di&s;traction and
Fury of the Night was vi&s;ible in the Faces of
the People, and every Body's fir&s;t Work was
to vi&s;it and enquire after Friends and Rela|tions.
The next Day or Two was almo&s;t en|tlrely
&s;pent in the Curio&s;ity of the People,
in viewing the Havock the Storm had made,
which was &s;o univer&s;al in <HI>London,</HI> and e&s;pe|cially
in the Out-Parts, that nothing can be
&s;aid &s;ufficient to de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>Another unhappy Circum&s;tance with which
this Di&s;a&s;ter was join'd, was a prodigious
Tide, which happen'd the next Day but one,
and was occa&s;ion'd by the Fury of the Winds;
which is al&s;o a Demon&s;tration, that the
Winds veer'd for Part of the Time to the
Northward: and as it is ob&s;ervable, and
known by all that under&s;tand our Sea Affairs,
that a North We&s;t Wind makes the Highe&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="53">
Tide, &s;o this blowing to the Northward, and
that with &s;uch unu&s;ual Violence, brought up
the Sea raging in &s;uch a manner, that in
&s;ome Parts of <HI>England</HI> 'twas incredible,
the Water ri&s;ing Six or Eight Foot higher
than it was ever known to do in the Me|mory
of Man; by which Ships were fleeted
up upon the firm Land &s;everal Rods off from
the Banks, and an incredible Number of Cattle
and People drown'd; as in the Pur&s;uit of this
Story will appear.</P>
<P>It was a &s;pecial Providence that &s;o directed
the Waters, that in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> the
Tide, thoug it ri&s;e higher than u&s;ual, yet it
did not &s;o prodigiou&s;ly exceed; but the
Height of them as it was, prov'd very pre|judicial
to abundance of People who&s;e Sellers
and Ware-hou&s;es were near the River; and
had the Water ri&s;en a Foot higher, all the
Mar&s;hes and Levels on both &s;ides the River
had been over-flowed, and a great part of the
Cattle drowned.</P>
<P>Though the Storm abated with the ri&s;ing
of the Sun, it &s;till blew exceeding hard; &s;o
hard, that no Boats dur&s;t &s;tir out on the Ri|ver,
but on extraordinary Occa&s;ions: and a|bout
Three a Clock in the Afternoon, the next
Day being <HI>Saturday,</HI> it increas'd again, and
we were in a fre&s;h Con&s;ternation, le&s;t it &s;hould
return with the &s;ame Violence. At Four it
blew an extreme Storm, with &s;udden Gu&s;ts
as violent as any time of the Night; but as it
<PB N="40" REF="54">
came with a great black Cloud, and &s;ome
Thunder, it brought a ha&s;ty Shower of
Rain which allay'd the Storm: &s;o that in a
quarter of an Hour it went off, and only
continued blowing as before.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of Weather held all <HI>Sabbath-Day</HI>
and <HI>Monday,</HI> till on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Afternoon it en|crea&s;ed
again; and all <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Night it blew
with &s;uch Fury, that many Families were a|fraid
to go to Bed: And had not the former
terrible Night harden'd the People to all things
le&s;s than it &s;elf, this Night would have pa&s;s'd
for a Storm &s;it to have been noted in our Al|manacks.
Several Stacks of Chimneys that &s;tood
out the great Storm, were blown down in this;
&s;everal Ships which e&s;cap'd in the great
Storm, peri&s;h'd this Night; and &s;everal Peo|ple
who had repair'd their Hou&s;es, had them
untiled again. Not but that I may allow
tho&s;e Chimneys that fell now might have
been di&s;abled before.</P>
<P>At this Rate it held blowing till <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI>
about One a Clock in the Afternoon, which
was that Day Seven-night on which it began;
&s;o that it might be called one continued
Storm from <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Noon to <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI>
Noon: in all which time, there was not one
Interval of Time in which a Sailor would not
have acknowledged it blew a Storm; and in
that time two &s;uch terrible Nights as I have
de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="55">
And this I particularly noted as to Time,
<HI>Wedne&s;day, Nov.</HI> the <HI>24th</HI> was a calm fine Day
as at that time of Year &s;hall be &s;een; 'till
above Four a Clock, when it began to
be Cloudy, and the Wind ro&s;e of a &s;udden,
and in half an Hours Time it blew a Storm.
<HI>Wedne&s;day, Dec.</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> it was very tempe&s;tu|ous
all the Morning; at One a Clock the
Wind abated, the Sky clear'd, and by Four
a Clock there was not a Breath of Wind.</P>
<P>Thus ended the Greate&s;t and the Long|e&s;t
Storm that ever the World &s;aw. The Ef|fects
of this terrible Providence are the Sub|ject
of the en&s;uing Chapter; and I clo&s;e
this with a Pa&s;toral Poem &s;ent us among
the Accounts of the Storm from a very inge|nious

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Extent of this Storm, and from what

Circum&s;tances as to the Time of it.</HEAD>
<P>AS all our Hi&s;tories are full of the Relati|ons
of Tempe&s;ts and Storms which have
happened in various Parts of the World, I hope
it may not be improper that &s;ome of them
have been thus ob&s;erv'd with their remark|able
Effects.</P>
<P>But as I have all along in&s;i&s;ted, that no
Storm &s;ince the Univer&s;al Deluge was like
this, either in its Violence or its Duration, &s;o
I mu&s;t al&s;o confirm it as to the particular of
its prodigious Extent.</P>
<P>All the Storms and Tempe&s;ts we have heard
of in the World, have been Gu&s;ts or Squauls
of Wind that have been carried on in their
proper Channels, and have &s;pent their Force
in a &s;horter &s;pace.</P>
<P>We feel nothing here of the Hurricanes of
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the North- We&s;ts of <HI>New-England</HI>
and <HI>Virginia,</HI> the terrible Gu&s;ts of the <HI>Levant,</HI>
or the frequent Tempe&s;ts of the <HI>North Cape.</HI>
When Sir <HI>Francis Wheeler</HI>'s Squadron peri&s;h'd
at <HI>Gibralter,</HI> when the City of <HI>Stracl&s;ond</HI> was
almo&s;t ruin'd by a Storm, <HI>England</HI> felt it not,
nor was the Air here di&s;turb'd with the Moti|on.
<PB N="47" REF="61">
Even at home we have had Storms of
violent Wind in one part of <HI>England</HI> which
have not been felt in another. And if what
I have been told has any truth in it, in
St. <HI>George</HI>'s Channel there has frequently
blown a Storm at Sea right up and down the
Channel which has been felt on neither Coa&s;t,
tho it is not above 20 Leagues from the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Shore.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> gives us the Particulars
of two terrible Storms in <HI>Holland</HI> while he was

Church at <HI>&V;trecht</HI> was utterly de&s;troy'd: and
after that there was a Storm &s;o violent in <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
that 46 Ve&s;&s;els were ca&s;t away at the
<HI>Texel,</HI> and almo&s;t all the Men drowned: and
yet we felt none of the&s;e Storms here.</P>
<P>And for this very rea&s;on I have re&s;erv'd an
Abridgment of the&s;e former Ca&s;es to this
place; which as they are recited by Sir <HI>Wil|liam
Temple,</HI> I &s;hall put them down in his own
Words, being not capable to mend them, and
not vain enough to pretend to it.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;tay'd only a Night at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> which
pa&s;s'd with &s;o great Thunders and Light|nings,
that I promis'd my &s;elf a very fair
Day after it, to go back to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> in the
<HI>States</HI> Yacht, that &s;till attended me. The
Morning prov'd &s;o; but towards Evening
the Sky grew foul, and the Sea men pre&s;ag'd
ill Weather, and &s;o re&s;olved to lie at Anchor
<PB N="48" REF="62">
before <HI>Bergen ap Zoom,</HI> the Wind being cro&s;s
and little. When the Night was fallen as
black as ever I &s;aw, it &s;oon began to clear
up, with the mo&s;t violent Fla&s;hes of Light|ning
as well as Cracks of Thunder, that I be|lieve
have ever been heard in our Age and
Climate. This continued all Night; and
we felt &s;uch a fierce Heat from every great
Fla&s;h of Lightning, that the Captain appre|hended
it would fire his Ship. But about 8
the next Morning the Wind changed, and
came up with &s;o &s;trong a Gale, that we came
to <HI>Rotterdam</HI> in about 4 Hours, and there
found all Mouths full of the Mi&s;chiefs and
Accidents that the la&s;t Night's Tempe&s;t had
occa&s;ioned both among the Boats and the
Hou&s;es, by the Thunder, Lightning, Hail,
or Whirlwinds. But the Day after came
Stories to the <HI>Hague</HI> from all Parts, of &s;uch
violent Effects as were almo&s;t incredible: At
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> they were deplorable, many Trees
torn up by the Roots, Ships &s;unk in the
Harbour, and Boats in the Channels; Hou&s;es
beaten down, and &s;everal People were
&s;natch'd from the Ground as they walk'd the
Streets, and thrown into the Canals. But all
was &s;ilenc'd by the Relations from <HI>&V;trecht,</HI>
where the Great and Ancient Cathedral was
torn in pieces by the Violences of this Storm;
and the va&s;t Pillars of Stone that &s;upported
it, were wreathed like a twi&s;ted Club, ha|ving
been &s;o &s;trongly compos'd and ciment|ed,
<PB N="49" REF="63">
as rather to &s;uffer &s;uch a Change of Figure
than break in pieces, as other Parts of the Fa|brick
did; hardly any Church in the Town e&s;|cap'd
the Violence of this Storm; and very
few Hou&s;es without the Marks of it; Nor
were the Effects of it le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing by the
Relations from <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where the
Damages were infinite, as well from Whirl|winds,
Thunder, Lightning, as from Hail|&s;tones
of prodigious Bigne&s;s. This was in the
Year 1674.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In <HI>November,</HI> 1675. happen'd a Storm
at <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> with a Spring-tide, &s;o violent,
as gave apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome lo&s;s irrecovera|ble
to the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> and by &s;everal
breaches in the great Diques near <HI>Exchu&s;en,</HI> and
others between <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>Harlem,</HI> made
way for &s;uch Inundations as had not been &s;een
before by any man then alive, and fill'd the
Country with many relations of mo&s;t deplo|rable
Events. But the incredible Diligence and
unanimous Endeavours of the People upon &s;uch
occa&s;ions, gave a &s;top to the Fury of that Ele|ment,
and made way for recovering next Year
all the Lands, though not the People, Cattel,

<HEAD>A dreadful Storm of Wind, accompanied
with Thunder, Lightning, Hail and

in many Parts of the Nation.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1661. being
<HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> very early in the Morning, there
began a very great and dreadful Storm of Wind
(accompanied with Thunder, Lightning, Hail,
and Rain, which in may Places were as &s;alt as
Brine) which continued with a &s;trange and un|u&s;ual
Violence till almo&s;t Night: the &s;ad Effects
whereof throughout the Nation are &s;o many,
that a very great Volume is not &s;ufficient to
contain the Narrative of them. And indeed
&s;ome of them are &s;o &s;tupendious and amazing,
that the Report of them, though from never &s;o
authentick Hands, will &s;carce gain Credit among
any but tho&s;e that have an affectionate Sen&s;e of
the unlimited Power of the Almighty, knowing
and believing that there is nothing too hard for
Him to do.</P>
<P>Some few of which wonderful Effects we
&s;hall give a brief Account of, as we have re|ceived
them from Per&s;ons of mo&s;t unque&s;tiona|ble

In the City of <HI>London,</HI> and in <HI>Covent Garden</HI>
and other Parts about <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>
five or &s;ix Per&s;ons were killed outright by the
Fall of Hou&s;es and Chimneys; e&s;pecially one
Mr. <HI>Luke Blith</HI> an Attorney, that lived at or near
<HI>Stamford</HI> in the County of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> was killed that
Day by the fall of a Riding-Hou&s;e not far from
<HI>Pickadilla:</HI> and there are &s;ome very remarka|ble
Circum&s;tances in this Man's Ca&s;e, which do
make his Death to appear at lea&s;t like a mo&s;t e|minent
Judgment and &s;evere Stroak of the Lord's
Hand upon him.</P>
<P>From other Parts likewi&s;e we have received
certain Information, that divers Per&s;ons were
killed by the Effects of this great Wind.</P>
<P>At <HI>Chiltenham</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> a Maid was
killed by the Fall of a Tree, in or near the
Church-Yard.</P>
<P>An hone&s;t Yeoman likewi&s;e of <HI>Scaldwel</HI> in
<HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> being upon a Ladder to &s;ave
his Hovel, was blown off, and fell upon a Plough,
died outright, and never &s;poke Word more.</P>
<P>Al&s;o at <HI>Tewksbury</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> a Man was
blown from an Hou&s;e, and broken to Pieces.</P>
<P>At <HI>Elsbury</HI> likewi&s;e in the &s;ame County, a
Woman was killed by the Fall of Tiles or Bricks
from an Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>And not far from the &s;ame Place, a Girl was
killed by the Fall of a Tree.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Northampton,</HI> a Man was killed by the

<P><PB N="52" REF="66">
Not far from <HI>Ip&s;vich</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> a Man was

<P>And about two Miles from the &s;aid Town

<P>At <HI>Langton,</HI> or near to it, in the County of
<HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> one Mr. <HI>Roberts</HI> had a Wind-mill
blown down, in which were three Men; and
by the Fall of it, one of them was killed outright,
a &s;econd had his Back broken, and the other had
his Arm or Leg &s;truck off; and both of them
(according to our be&s;t Information) are &s;ince
dead.</P>
<P>Several other In&s;tances there are of the like
Nature; but it would be too tedious to mention
them: Let the&s;e therefore &s;uffice to &s;tir us up
to Repentance, <HI>le&s;t we likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>There are al&s;o many Effects of this Storm
which are of another Nature, whereof we
&s;hall give this following brief Account.</P>
<P>The Wind hath very much prejudiced many
Churches in &s;everal Parts of the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>At Temksbury</HI> in <HI>Glonce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> it blew down
a very fair Window belonging to the Church
there, both the Gla&s;s, and the Stone-work al&s;o;
the Doors likewi&s;e of that Church were blown
open, much of the Lead torn up, and &s;ome
Part of a fair Pinnacle thrown down.</P>
<P>Al&s;o at <HI>Red-Marly</HI> and <HI>Newin,</HI> not far from
<HI>Tewksbury,</HI> their Churches are extreamly broken
and &s;hatterd, $T not a con&s;iderable part of them
blown down. The like was done to mo&s;t, if
not all the Publick Meeting-places at <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="67">
City. And it is reported, that &s;ome Hundreds
of Pounds will not &s;uffice to repair the Damage
done to the Cathedral at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> e&s;pecially
in that Part that is over the Quire.</P>
<P>The like Fate happen'd to many more of
them, as <HI>Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Leighton Beau-de&s;art</HI> in
<HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Eaton-Soken</HI> in the &s;ame Coun|ty;
where they had newly erected a very fair
Cro&s;s of Stone, which the Wind blew down:
and, as &s;ome of the Inhabitants did ob&s;erve,
that was the fir&s;t Damage which that Town
&s;u&s;tained by the Storm, though afterwards in o|ther
re&s;pects al&s;o they were in the &s;ame Condi|tion
with their Neighbours. The Stesples al&s;o,
and other Parts of the Churches of <HI>Shenley,
Waddon,</HI> and <HI>Wool&s;ton</HI> in the County of <HI>Bucks,</HI>
have been very much rent and torn by the Wind.
The Spire of <HI>Finchinfield</HI> Steeple in the County
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> was blown down, and it brake through
the Body of the Church, and &s;poild many of
the Pews; &s;ome Hundreds of Pounds will not
repair that Lo&s;s. But that which is mo&s;t re|markable
of this kind, is, the Fall of that mo&s;t
famous Spire, or Pinnacle of the Tower-Church
in <HI>Ip&s;wich:</HI> it was blown down upon the Body
of the Church, and fell rever&s;ed, the &s;harp End
of the Shaft &s;triking through the Leads on the
South-&s;ide of the Church, carried much of the
Timber-work down before it into the Alley
ju&s;t behind the Pulpit, and took off one Side of
the Sounding board over the Pulpit: it &s;hatter|ed
many Pews: The Weather-Cock, and the
Iron upon which it &s;tood, broke off as it fell;
<PB N="54" REF="68">
but the narrowe&s;t Part of the Wood-work,
upon which the Fane &s;tood, fell into the Alley,
broke quite through a Grave-&s;tone, and ran
&s;horing under two Coffins that had been placed
there one on another; that Part of the Spire
which was pluck'd up was about three Yards
deep in the Earth, and it is believed &s;ome Part
of it is yet behind in the Ground: &s;ome Hun|dreds
of Pounds will not make good the Detri|ment
done to the Church by the Fall of this Pin|nacle.</P>
<P>Very
great Prejudice has been done to pri|vate
Hou&s;es; many of them blown down, and
others extreamly &s;hattered and torn. It is
thought that five thou&s;and Pounds will not
make good the Repairs at <HI>Audley-End Hou&s;e,</HI>
which belongs to the Earl of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> A good
Part al&s;o of the Crown-Office in the <HI>Temple</HI> is
blown down. The In&s;tances of this kind are
&s;o many and &s;o obvious, that it would needle&s;ly
take up too much time to give the Reader an
Account of the Collection of them; only there
has been &s;uch a wonderful De&s;truction of Barns,
that (looking &s;o much like a Judgment from
the Lord, who the la&s;t Year took away our Corn,
and this our Barns) we cannot but give a
&s;hort Account of &s;ome Part of that Intelli|gence
which hath come to our Hands of that
Nature.</P>
<P>A Gentleman, of good Account, in <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI>
affirms, that in a few Miles riding that Day,
there was eleven Barns and Out-hou&s;es blown
down in the Road within his View; and with|in
<PB N="55" REF="69">
a very few Miles of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> round about, a|bove
thirty Barns and many of them with Corn
in them, were blown down. At <HI>Southold</HI> not
far from the Place before mentioned, many new
Hou&s;es and Barns (built &s;ince a late Fire that
happened there) are blown down; as al&s;o a Salt|hou&s;e
is de&s;troyed there: and a thou&s;and Pounds,
as it is believed, will not make up that particular
Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>From <HI>Tewksbury</HI> it is certified, that an incredi|ble
Number of Barns have been blown down
in the &s;mall Towns and Villages thereabouts.
At <HI>Twyning,</HI> at lea&s;t eleven Barns are blown
down. In <HI>A&s;hchurch</HI> Pari&s;h &s;even or eight. At
<HI>Lee,</HI> five. At <HI>Norton,</HI> a very great Number,
three whereof belonging to one Man. The great
Abby-Barn al&s;o at <HI>Tewksbury</HI> is blown down.</P>
<P>It is credibly reported, that within a very few
Miles Circumference in <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> about an
hundred and forty Barns are blown down. At
<HI>Finchinfield</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> which is but an ordinary
Village, about &s;ixteen Barns were blown down.
Al&s;o at a Town called <HI>Wilcham&s;ted</HI> in the Coun|ty
of <HI>Bedford</HI> (a very &s;mall Village) fifteen Barns
at lea&s;t are blown down. But e&s;pecially the
Par&s;onage Barns went to wrack in many Places
throughout the Land: In a few Miles Compa&s;s
in <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> and &s;o in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> and
other Places, eight, ten, and twelve are blown
down; and at <HI>Yielding Par&s;onage</HI> in the County
of <HI>Bedford</HI> (out of which was thru&s;t by Op|pre&s;&s;ion
and Violence the late Incumbent) all
the Barns belonging to it are down. The In|&s;tances
<PB N="56" REF="70">
al&s;o of this kind are innumerable, which
we &s;hall therefore forbear to make further men|tion
of.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o a large Account of the blowing
down of a very great and con&s;iderable Number
of Fruit-Trees, and other Trees in &s;everal
Parts; we &s;hall only pick out two or three Pa&s;&s;a|ges
which are the mo&s;t remarkable. In the
<HI>Countries of Glouce&s;ter, Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI>
&s;everal Per&s;ons have lo&s;t whole Orchards of
Fruit-trees; and many particular Mens Lo&s;s
hath amounted to the Value of forty or fifty
Pounds at the lea&s;t, meerly by De&s;truction of
their Fruit-Trees: and &s;o in other Parts of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
proportionably the like Damage hath been
&s;u&s;tained in this Re&s;pect. And as for other
Trees, there has been a great De&s;truction made
of them in many Places by this Storm. Several
were blown down at <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI> And three
thou&s;and brave Oaks at lea&s;t, but in one principal
Part of the Fore&s;t of <HI>Dean,</HI> belonging to his
Maje&s;ty. In a little Grove at <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> belonging
to the Lord of <HI>Her$&s;ord</HI> (which together with
the Spice of the Steeple before-mentioned, were
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ornaments of that Town)
are blown down at lea&s;t two hundred goodly
Trees, one of which was an A&s;h, which had
ten Load of Wood upon it: there are now few
Trees left there.</P>
<P>In <HI>Bramion Bryan Park</HI> in the County of <HI>He|re&s;crd,</HI>
belonging to Sir <HI>Edward Harly,</HI> one of the
late Knights of the <HI>Bath,</HI> above thirteen hundred
Trees are blown down; and above &s;ix hundred
<PB N="57" REF="71">
in <HI>Hopton Park</HI> not far from it: and thus it is pro|portionably
in mo&s;t Places where this Storm was
felt. And the Truth is, the Damage which
the People of this Nation have &s;u&s;tained upon all
Accounts by this Storm, is not ea&s;ily to be va|lued:
&s;ome &s;ober and di&s;creet People, who have
endeavoured to compute the Lo&s;s of the &s;everal
Countries on with another, by the De&s;truction of
Hou&s;es and Barns, the blowing away of Hovels
and Ricks of Corn, the falling of Trees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do be|lieve
it can come to little le&s;s than two Millions
of Money.</P>
<P>There are yet behind many Particulars of a
di&s;tinct Nature from tho&s;e that have been &s;po|ken
of; &s;ome whereof are very wonderful, and
call for a very &s;erious Ob&s;ervation of them.</P>
<P>In the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> e&s;pe|cially
on the Bridge and near <HI>Wallingford-hou&s;e,</HI>
&s;everal Per&s;ons were blown down one on the
Top of another.</P>
<P>In <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> a Man was taken up, carried
a Pole in Length, and blown over a very high
Hedge; and the like in other Places.</P>
<P>The Water in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and o|ther
Places, was in a very &s;trange manner
blown up into the Air: Yea, in the new Pond
in <HI>James's Park,</HI> the Fi&s;h, to the Number of at
lea&s;t two Hundred, where blown out and lay
by the Bank-&s;ide, whereof many were Eye|witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>At
<HI>Moreclack</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> the <HI>Birds,</HI> as they at|tempted
to fly, were beaten down to the Ground
by the Violence of the Wind.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="72">
At <HI>Epping</HI> in the County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> a very
great Oak was blown down, which of it &s;elf
was rai&s;ed again, and doth grow firmly at this
Day.</P>
<P>At <HI>Taunton,</HI> a great Tree was blown down,
the upper Part whereof re&s;ted upon a Brick or
Stone-wall, and after a little time, by the $word$
of the Wind, the lower part of the $word$ was
blown quite over the Wall.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Hereford,</HI> &s;everal $span$ were,
by the Violence of the Wind $span$ the
Ground; one Man (as it is credibly $$ported)
at lea&s;t &s;ix Yards.</P>
<P>The great Fane at <HI>Whitehall</HI> was blown down;
and one of the four which were upon the <HI>white
Tower,</HI> and two more of them &s;trangely bent;
which are to be &s;een at this Day, to the Admi|ration
of all that behold them.</P>
<P>The &s;everal <HI>Triumphant Arches</HI> in the City of
<HI>London</HI> were much &s;hattered and torn; That in
<HI>Leaden-hall-&s;treet</HI> lo&s;t the King's Arms, and ma|ny
other rare Pieces that were affixed to it; That
in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> which repre&s;ented the Church, &s;uf|fered
very much by the Fury of the Storm;
and a great Part of that in <HI>Fleet&s;treet</HI> (which re|pre&s;ented
Plenty) was blown down: but, ble&s;&s;ed
be God, none as we hear of were either killed
or hurt by the Fall of it.</P>
<P>The Wind was &s;o &s;trong, that it blew down
&s;everal Carts loaded with Hay in the Road be|tween
<HI>Barnet</HI> and <HI>London;</HI> and in other Roads
leading to the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="73">
<HI>Norwich</HI> Coach, with four or &s;ix Hor&s;es, was
not able to come towards <HI>London,</HI> but &s;tayed
by the way till the Storm was &s;omewhat aba|ted.</P>
<P>It
is al&s;o credibly reported, That all, or &s;ome
of the Heads which were &s;et up upon <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Hall,</HI>
were that Day blown down.</P>
<P>There was a very dreadful Lightning which
did at fir&s;t accompany the Storm, and by it &s;ome
of his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold conceive that the Fire
which happened at <HI>Whitehall</HI> that Morning, was
kindled; as al&s;o that at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> by which
(as we are informed) &s;even or eight Hou&s;es
were burnt down.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Thus far the Author of Mirabilis Annis.</HEAD>
<P>'Tis very ob&s;ervable, that this Storm blew
from the &s;ame Quarter as the la&s;t, and that they
had le&s;s of it Northward than here; in which
they were much alike.</P>
<P>Now as the&s;e Storms were perhaps very furi|ous
in &s;ome Places, yet they neither came up
to the Violence of this, nor any way to be com|par'd
for the Extent, and when ruinous in one
Country, were hardly heard of in the next.</P>
<P>But this terrible Night &s;hook all <HI>Europe;</HI> and
how much farther it extended, he only knows
who <HI>has his way in the Whirlwind, and in the
Storm, and the Clouds are the Du&s;t of his
Feet.</HI></P>
<P>As this Storm was fir&s;t felt from the We&s;t,
&s;ome have conjectur'd that the fir&s;t Generation
or rather Collection of Materials, was from the
<PB N="60" REF="74">
Continent of <HI>America,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly from that part
of <HI>Florida</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> where, if we re&s;pect na|tural
Cau&s;es, the Confluence of Vapours rais'd
by the Sun from the va&s;t and unknown Lakes
and Inland Seas of Water, which as &s;ome relate
are incredibly large as well as numerous, might
afford &s;ufficient Matter for the Exhalation; and
where time adding to the Preparation, God,
who has generally confin'd his Providence to
the Chain of natural Cau&s;es, might mu&s;ter to|gether
tho&s;e Troops of Combu&s;tion till they
made a &s;ufficient Army duly proportion'd to the
Expedition de&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>I am the rather inclin'd to this Opinion, be|cau&s;e
we are told, they felt upon that Coa&s;t an
unu&s;ual Tempe&s;t a few Days before the fatal
27th of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I have never &s;tudied the Motion
of the Clouds &s;o nicely, as to calculate how
long time this Army of Terror might take up
in its furious March; po&s;&s;ibly the velocity of
its Motion might not be &s;o great at its fir&s;t &s;et|ting
out as it was afterward, as a Hor&s;e that is
to run a Race does not immediately put him&s;elf
into the height of his Speed: and tho' it may be
true, that by the length of the way the force of
the Wind &s;pends it &s;elf, and &s;o by degrees cea|&s;es
as the Vapour finds more room for Dilation;
be&s;ides, yet we may &s;uppo&s;e a Conjunction of
&s;ome confederate Matter which might fall in with
it by the way, or which meeting it at its Arri|val
here, might join Forces in executing the
Commi&s;&s;ion receiv'd from above, all natural
<PB N="61" REF="75">
Cau&s;es being allow'd a Sub&s;erviency to the
Direction of the great &s;upream Cau&s;e; yet
where the va&s;t Collection of Matter had its
fir&s;t Motion, as it did not all take Motion in one
and the &s;ame moment, &s;o when all the Parts had
felt the Influence, as they advanc'd and pre&s;s'd
tho&s;e before them, the Violence mu&s;t increa&s;e in
proportion: and thus we may conceive that the
Motion might not have arriv'd at its Meridian
Violence till it reach'd our I&s;land; and even
then it blew &s;ome Days with more than com|mon
fury, yet much le&s;s than that la&s;t Night of
its force; and even that Night the Violence was
not at its extremity till about an hour before
Sun ri&s;e, and then it continued declining, tho' it
blew a full Storm for four Days after it.</P>
<P>Thus Providence, by who&s;e &s;pecial Direction
the Quantity and Conduct of this Judgment
was manag'd, &s;eem'd to proportion things &s;o,
as that by the cour&s;e of things the proportion of
Matter being &s;uited to Di&s;tance of Place, the
Motion &s;hou'd arrive at its full Force ju&s;t at the
Place where its Execution was to begin.</P>
<P>As then our I&s;land was the fir&s;t, this way, to
receive the Impre&s;&s;ions of the violent Motion,
it had the terrible&s;t Effects here; and continu|ing
its &s;teady Cour&s;e, we find it carried a true
Line clear over the Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> tra|vers'd
<HI>England, France, Germany,</HI> the <HI>Baltick</HI>
Sea, and pa&s;&s;ing the Northern Continent of
<HI>Sweedland, Finland, Mu&s;ccvy,</HI> and part of <HI>Tarta|ry,</HI>
mu&s;t at la&s;t lo&s;e it &s;elf in the va&s;t Northern
Ocean, where Man never came, and Ship never
<PB N="62" REF="76">
fail'd; and its Violence cou'd have no effect, but
upon the va&s;t Mountains of Ice and the huge
Drifts of Snow, in which Aby&s;s of Moi&s;ture and
Cold it is very probable the Force of it was
check'd, and the World re&s;tor'd to Calmne&s;s
and Quiet: and in this Circle of Fury it might
find its End not far off from where it had its
Beginning, the Fiercene&s;s of the Motion perhaps
not arriving to a Period, till having pa&s;s'd the
Pole, it reached again the Northern Parts of
<HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>The Effects of this impetuous Cour&s;e, are the
proper Subjects of this Book; and what they
might be before our I&s;land felt its Fury, who
can tell? Tho&s;e unhappy Wretches who had
the misfortune to meet it in its fir&s;t Approach,
can tell us little, having been hurried by its ir|re&s;i&s;tible
Force directly into Eternity: how ma|ny
they are, we cannot pretend to give an Ac|count;
we are told of about &s;eventeen Ships,
which having been out at Sea are never heard
of: which is the common way of Di&s;cour&s;e of
Ships founder'd in the Ocean: and indeed all we
can &s;ay of them is, the fearful <HI>Exit</HI> they have
made among the Mountains of Waters, can on|ly
be duly reflected on by tho&s;e who have &s;een
tho&s;e Wonders of God in the Deep.</P>
<P>Yet I cannot omit here to ob&s;erve, That this
Lo&s;s was in all probability much le&s;s than it
would otherwi&s;e have been; becau&s;e the Winds
having blown with very great Fury, at the
&s;ame Point, for near fourteen Days before the
Violence grew to its more uncommon height,
<PB N="63" REF="77">
all tho&s;e Ships which were newly gone to Sea
were forc'd back, of which &s;ome were driven
into <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Falmouth</HI> who had been above
a hundred and fifty Leagues at Sea; others,
which had been farther, took Sanctuary in <HI>Ire|land.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, All tho&s;e Ships which
were homeward bound, and were within 500
Leagues of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shore, had been hurried
&s;o furiou&s;ly on <HI>afore it (as the Seamen &s;ay)</HI> that
they had reach'd their Port before the Extre|mity
of the Storm came on; &s;o that the Sea was
as it were &s;wept clean of all Shipping, tho&s;e
which were coming home were blown home
before their time; tho&s;e that had attempted to
put to Sea, were driven back again in&s;pight of
all their Skill and Courage: for the Wind had
blown &s;o very hard, directly into the Channel,
that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of their keeping the
Sea who&s;e Cour&s;e was not right afore the Wind.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the&s;e two Circum&s;tances
had fill'd all our Ports with unu&s;ual Fleets of
Ships, either ju&s;t come home or outward-bound,
and con&s;equently the Lo&s;s among them was ve|ry
terrible; and the Havock it made among
them, tho' it was not &s;o much as every body
expected, was &s;uch as no Age or Circum&s;tance
can ever parallel, and we hope will never feel
again.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o high the Winds blew even before
<HI>that we call the Storm,</HI> that had not that intole|rable
Tempe&s;t follow'd &s;o &s;oon after, we &s;hould
have counted tho&s;e Winds extraordinary high:
<PB N="64" REF="78">
and any one may judge of the Truth of this
from the&s;e few Particulars; That the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>
Fleet, compos'd of near a hundred Sail, which
happen'd to be then upon the Coa&s;t, was ab&s;o|lutely
di&s;pers'd and &s;catter'd, &s;ome got into
<HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> &s;ome into <HI>Hall,</HI> and &s;ome into <HI>Yar|mouth</HI>
Roads; two &s;ounder'd in the Se$; one or
two more run a-&s;hore, and were lo&s;t; and the
<HI>Re&s;erve</HI> Frigat, their Convoy, founder'd in <HI>Yar|mouth</HI>
Roads, all her Men being lo&s;t, and no
Boat from the Shore dur&s;t go off to relieve her,
tho' it was in the Day-time, but all her Men
peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame previous Storms the
Man of War was lo&s;t off of <HI>Harwich;</HI> but by
the help of &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els mo&s;t of her Men
were &s;av'd.</P>
<P>And &s;o high the Winds blew for neat a Fort|night,
that no Ship &s;tirr'd out of Harbour; and
all the Ve&s;&s;els, great or &s;mall, that were out at
Sea, made for &s;ome Port or other for &s;helter.</P>
<P>In this juncture of time it happen'd, that to|gether
with the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Fleet, a great Fleet of
Laden Colliers, near 400 Sail, were ju&s;t put
out of the River <HI>Tine:</HI> and the&s;e being generally
deep and unweildy Ships, met with hard mea|&s;ure,
tho' not &s;o fatal to them as was expected:
&s;uch of them as could run in for <HI>Humber,</HI> where
a great many were lo&s;t afterwards, as I &s;hall
relate in its cour&s;e; &s;ome got &s;helter under the
high Lands of <HI>Cromer</HI> and the Northern Shores
of the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and the greater num|ber
reach'd into <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="79">
So that when the Great Storm came, our
Ports round the Sea-Coa&s;t of <HI>England</HI> were ex|ceeding
full of Ships of all &s;orts: a brief account
where of take as follows.</P>
<P>At <HI>Grinsby, Hall,</HI> and the other Roads of the
<HI>Humber,</HI> lay about 80 Sail, great and &s;mall, of
which about 50 were Colliers, and part of the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Fleet as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>In <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads there rode at lea&s;t 400
Sail, being mo&s;t of them Laden Colliers, <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>
Men, and Coa&s;ters from <HI>Lynn</HI> and <HI>H$ll.</HI></P>
<P>In the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> at the <HI>Nore,</HI> lay a|bout
12 Sail of the Queen's hir'd Ships and
Store-&s;hips, and only two Men of War.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Cloud&s;ly Shovel</HI> was ju&s;t arriv'd from the
<HI>Mediterranean</HI> with the Royal Navy: Part of
them lay at <HI>St. Heliens,</HI> part in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and
with 12 of the bigge&s;t Ships he was coming
round the <HI>Foreland</HI> to bring them into <HI>Chatham;</HI>
and when the Great Storm began was at an
Anchor at the <HI>Gunfleet,</HI> from whence the <HI>A&s;&s;oci|ation</HI>
was driven off from Sea as far as the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Norway:</HI> What became of the re&s;t, I refer to
a Chapter by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>At <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> there rode five <HI>East India</HI> Men,
and about 30 Sail of other Merchant-men, all
outward bound.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Downs</HI> 160 Sail of Merchant Ships out|ward
bound, be&s;ides that part of the Fleet which
came in with Sir <HI>Cloud&s;ly Shovel,</HI> which con&s;i&s;t|ed
of about 18 Men of War, with Tenders and
Victuallers.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="80">
At <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and <HI>Cowes</HI> there lay three
Fleets; fir&s;t, a Fleet of Tran&s;ports and Tenders,
who with Admiral <HI>Dilks</HI> brought the Forces
from <HI>Ireland</HI> that were to accompany the King

<P>In <HI>Plymouth</HI> Sound, <HI>Falmouth</HI> and <HI>Milford</HI>

of Merchant-&s;hips, driven in for Shelter and
Harbour from the Storm, mo&s;t homeward
bound from the I&s;lands and Colonies of <HI>Ame|rica.</HI></P>
<P>The
<HI>Virginia</HI> Fleet, <HI>Barbadces</HI> Fleet, and &s;ome
<HI>East India</HI> Men, lay &s;catter'd in all our Ports,

Men of War lay at <HI>Helvoet Sluice;</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Fleet from the <HI>Texel</HI> lay off of <HI>Cad&s;andt,</HI> with
their Forces on Board, under the Admiral <HI>Cal|lenberge.</HI>
Both the&s;e Fleets made 180 Sail.</P>
<P>I think I may very &s;afely affirm, That hard|ly
in the Memory of the olde&s;t Man living, was
a juncture of Time when an Accident of this
<PB N="67" REF="81">
nature could have happen'd, that &s;o much Ship|ping,
laden out and home, ever was in Port at
one time.</P>
<P>No Man will wonder that the Damages to
this Nation were &s;o great, if they con&s;ider the&s;e
unhappy Circum&s;tances: it &s;hou'd rather be
wonder'd at, that we have no more Di&s;a&s;ters
to account to Po&s;terity, but that the Navigation
of this Country came off &s;o well.</P>
<P>And therefore &s;ome People have excus'd the
Extravagancies of the <HI>Paris Gazetteer,</HI> who af|firm'd
in Print, that there was 30000 Sea-men
lo&s;t in the &s;everal Ports of <HI>England,</HI> and 300
Sail of Ships; which they &s;ay was a probable
Conjecture; and that con&s;idering the multitude
of Shipping, the Openne&s;s of the Roads in the
<HI>Downs, Yarmouth,</HI> and the <HI>Nore,</HI> and the prodi|gious
Fury of the Wind, any Man would have
gue&s;s'd the &s;ame as he.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, It is a thing wonderful to con&s;i|der,
that e&s;pecially in the <HI>Downs</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth</HI>
Roads any thing &s;hou'd be &s;afe: all Men that
know how wild a Road the fir&s;t is, and what
Crowds of Ships there lay in the la&s;t; how al|mo&s;t
every thing quitted the Road, and neither
Anchor nor Cable would hold mu&s;t wonder
what Shift or what Cour&s;e the Mariners could
direct them&s;elves to for Safety.</P>
<P>Some which had not a Ma&s;t &s;tanding, nor an
Anchor or Cable left them, went out to Sea
wherever the Winds drove them; and lying
like a Trough in the Water, wallow'd about
till the Winds aba$ed; and after were driven,
<PB N="68" REF="82">
&s;ome into one Port, &s;ome into another, as Pro|vidence
guided them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Horror and Confu&s;ion &s;eiz'd upon

<HEAD>OF THE

<P>THE particular dreadful Effects of this
Tempe&s;t, are the Subject of the en&s;uing
Part of this Hi&s;tory: And tho' the Rea|der
is not to expect that all the Particulars can
be put into this Account, and perhaps many ve|ry
remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages may never come to our
Knowledge; yet as we have endeavour'd to
furni&s;h our &s;elves with the mo&s;t authentick Ac|counts
we could from all Parts of the Nation,
and a great many worthy Gentlemen have con|tributed
their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in various, and &s;ome
very exact Relations and curious Remarks; &s;o
we pretend, not to be meanly furni&s;h'd for this
Work.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen, who&s;e Accounts are but of
common and trivial Damages, we hope will
not take it ill from the Author, if they are not

which are now doing in a very authentick man|ner:
but as the World has been long expecting

not a little contributing to the Information of

&s;hall be a Supplement to the Work; if not,
&s;ome other Method &s;hall be found out to make

<PB N="72" REF="86">
<HEAD>I. Of the Damages in the City of London,
and Parts adjacent.</HEAD>
<P>Indeed the City was a &s;trange Spectacle, the
Morning after the Storm, as &s;oon as the People
could put their Heads out of Doors: though I
believe, every Body expected the De&s;truction
was bad enough; yet I que&s;tion very much, if
any Body believed the Hundredth Part of what
they &s;aw.</P>
<P>The Streets lay &s;o covered with Tiles and
Slates, from the Tops of the Hou&s;es, e&s;pecially
in the Out-parts, that the Quantity is incredible:
and the Hou&s;es were &s;o univer&s;ally &s;tript, that
all the Tiles in Fifty Miles round would be able
to repair but a &s;mall Part of it.</P>
<P>Something may be gue&s;t at on this Head,
from the &s;udden Ri&s;e of the Price of Tiles;
which ri&s;e from 21 <HI>s. per</HI> Thou&s;and to 6 <HI>l.</HI> for
plain Tiles; and from 50 <HI>s. per</HI> Thou&s;and for
Pantiles, to 10 <HI>l.</HI> and Bricklayers Labour
to 5 <HI>s. per</HI> Day: And tho' after the fir&s;t Hurry
the Prices fell again, it was not that the Quan|tity
was &s;upply'd; but becau&s;e,
<HI>1st,</HI> The Charge was &s;o extravagant, that
an univer&s;al Neglect of them&s;elves, appear'd
both in Landlord and Tenant; an incredible
Number of Hou&s;es remain'd all the Winter un|covered,
and expos'd to all the Inconveniences
of Wet and Cold; and are &s;o even at the Wri|ting
of this Chapter.</P>

2. Tho&s;e People who found it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to cover their Hou&s;es, but were unwil|lling
to go to the extravagant Price of Tiles;
chang'd their Covering to that of Wood, as a
pre&s;ent Expedient, till the Sea&s;on for making
of Tiles &s;hould come on; and the fir&s;t Hurry
being over, the Prices abate: and 'tis on this
Score, that we &s;ee, to this Day, whole Ranks of
Buildings, as in <HI>Chri&s;t Church Ho&s;pital,</HI> the <HI>Tem|ple,
Asks-Ho&s;pital, Old-&s;treet, Hog&s;den-Squares,</HI>
and infinite other Places, covered entirely with
Deal Boards; and are like to continue &s;o, per|haps
a Year or two longer, for Want of Tiles.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Rea&s;ons reduc'd the Tile-Mer|chants
to &s;ell at a more moderate Price: But 'tis
not an irrational Sugge&s;tion, that all the Tiles
which &s;hall be made this whole Summer, will
not repair the Damage in the covering of Hou&s;es
within the Circumference of the City, and Ten
Miles round.</P>
<P>The next Article in our Street Damage was,
the Fall of Chimneys; and as Chimneys in
the City Buildings are built in large Stacks, the
Hou&s;es being &s;o high, the Fall of them had the
more Power, by their own Weight, to de|moli&s;h
the Hou&s;es they fell upon.</P>
<P>'Tis not po&s;&s;ible to give a di&s;tinct Account of
the Number, or particular Stacks of Chimneys,
which fell in this fatal Night; but the Reader
may gue&s;s by this Particular, that in <HI>Cambray-Hou&s;e,</HI>
commonly &s;o called, a great Hou&s;e near

Tenements; the Collector of the&s;e Remarks
counted Eleven or Thirteen Stacks of Chimneys,
either wholly thrown in, or the greate&s;t Parts
of them at lea&s;t, what was expos'd to the Wind,
blown off. I have heard Per&s;ons, who pre|tended
to ob&s;erve the De&s;olation of that terrible
Night very nicely; and who, by what they had
&s;een and enquired into, thought them&s;elves ca|pable
of making &s;ome Calculations, affirm, They
could give an Account of above Two Thou&s;and
Stacks of Chimneys blown down in and about
<HI>London;</HI> be&s;ides Gable Ends of Hou&s;es, &s;ome
whole Roofs, and Sixteen or Twenty whole

finding the Danger he was in by the &s;haking of
the Hou&s;e, jumpt out of Bed to &s;ave him&s;elf;
and had, in all Probability, Time enough to
have got out of the Hou&s;e, but &s;taying to &s;trike
a Light, a Stack of Chimneys fell in upon him,
kill'd him, and wounded his Wife.</P>
<P>Two Boys at one Mr. <HI>Purefoy</HI>'s, in <HI>Cro&s;s-&s;treet
Hatton-Garden,</HI> were both kill'd, and buried in
the Rubbi&s;h of a Stack of Chimneys; and a
third very much wounded.</P>
<P>A Woman in <HI>Jewin-&s;treet,</HI> and Two Per&s;ons
more near <HI>Alder&s;gate-&s;treet,</HI> were kill'd; the fir&s;t,
as it is reported, by venturing to run out of the
Hou&s;e into the Street; and the other Two by
the Fall of a Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In <HI>Threadneedle-&s;treet,</HI> one Mr. <HI>Simp&s;on,</HI> a Scrive|ner
being in Bed and fa&s;t a-&s;leep, heard nothing
of the Storm; but the re&s;t of the Family being
more &s;en&s;ible of Danger, &s;ome of them went
up, and wak'd him; and telling him their own
Apprehen&s;ion, pre&s;s'd him to ri&s;e; but he too
fatally &s;leepy, and con&s;equently unconcern'd at
the Danger, told them, he did not apprehend
any Thing; and &s;o, notwith&s;tanding all their
Per&s;ua&s;ions, could not be prevailed with to ri&s;e:
<PB N="76" REF="90">
they had not been gone many Minutes out of
his Chamber, before the Chimneys fell in
broke through the Roof over him, and kill'd
him in his Bed.</P>
<P>A Carpenter in <HI>White-Cro&s;s-&s;treet</HI> was kill'd
almo&s;t in the &s;ame Manner, by a Stack of Chim|neys
of the <HI>Swan</HI> Tavern, which fell into his
Hou&s;e: it was reported, That his Wife earne&s;tly
de&s;ir'd him not to go to Bed; and had prevail'd
upon him to &s;it up till near two a Clock, but
then finding him&s;elf very heavy, he would go
to Bed again&s;t all his Wife's Intreaties; after
which, &s;he wak'd him, and de&s;ir'd him to ri&s;e,
which he refus'd, being &s;omething angry for
being di&s;turb'd; and going to &s;leep again, was
kill'd in his Bed: and his Wife, who would
not go to Bed, e&s;cap'd.</P>
<P>In this Manner, our Weekly Bills gave us an
Account of Twenty One Per&s;ons kill'd in the
City of <HI>London,</HI> and Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>Some of our printed Accounts give us larger
and plainer Accounts of the Lo&s;s of Lives, than
I will venture to affirm for Truth; as of &s;everal
Hou&s;es near <HI>Moor-Fields</HI> levell'd with the Ground:
Fourteen People drowned in a Wherry going to
<HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and Five in a Wherry from <HI>Chel&s;ey.</HI>
Not that it is not very probable to be true; but
as I re&s;olve not to hand any thing to Po&s;terity,
but what comes very well atte&s;ted, I omit &s;uch
Relations as I have not extraordinary A&s;&s;urance
as to the Fact.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="91">
The Fall of Bricke-Walls, by the Fury of this
Tempe&s;t, in and about <HI>London,</HI> would make
a little Book of it &s;elf; and as this affects the
Out-Parts chiefly, where the Gardens and Yards
are wall'd in, &s;o few &s;uch have e&s;cap'd: at St.
<HI>James</HI>'s a con&s;iderable part of the Garden Wall;
at <HI>Greenwich Park</HI> there are &s;everal pieces of the
Wall down for an Hundred Rods in a Place;
and &s;ome much more, at <HI>Batter&s;ey, Chel&s;ey,
Putney,</HI> at <HI>Clapham,</HI> at <HI>Deptford,</HI> at <HI>Hackney,
I&s;lington, Hog&s;den, Wood's Clo&s;e</HI> by St. <HI>John's
Street,</HI> and on every &s;ide the City, the Walls
of the Gardens have generally felt the Shock,
and lie flat on the Ground twenty, thirty Rod
of walling in a Place.</P>
<P>The publick Edifices of the City come next
under our Con&s;ideration; and the&s;e have had
their Share in the Fury of this terrible Night.</P>
<P>A part of her Maje&s;ty's Palace, as is before
ob&s;erv'd, with a Stack of Chimneys in the
Centre of the new Buildings, then not quite fi|ni&s;hed,
fell with &s;uch a terrible Noi&s;e as very
much alarm'd the whole Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>The Roof of the Guard-hou&s;e at <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
as is al&s;o ob&s;erv'd before, was quite blown off;
and the great Vane, or Weather-Cock at <HI>White|hall</HI>
blown down.</P>
<P>The Lead, on the Tops of the Churches
and other Buildings, was in many Places roll'd
up like a Roll of Parchment, and blown in
&s;ome Places clear off from the Buildings;
as at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abby,</HI> St. <HI>Andrews Holbourn,
<PB N="78" REF="92">
Chri&s;t-Church Ho&s;pital,</HI> and abundance of other
Places.</P>
<P>Two of the new built Turrets, on the Top of
St. <HI>Mary Aldermary Church,</HI> were blown off,
where of One fell upon the Roof of the Church;
of Eight Pinnacles on the Top of St. <HI>Albans
Wood&s;treet,</HI> Five of them were blown down;
Part of One of the Spires of St. <HI>Mary Overies</HI>
blown off; Four Pinnacles on the Steeple of
St. <HI>Michael Crooked Lane</HI> blown quite off: The
Vanes and Spindles of the Weather-Cocks, in
many Places, bent quite down; as on St. <HI>Mi|chael
Cornhil,</HI> St. <HI>Sepulchres,</HI> the <HI>Tower,</HI> and di|vers
other Places.</P>
<P>It was very remarkable, that the Bridge over
the <HI>Thames</HI> received but little Damage, and not
in Proportion to what in common Rea&s;on might
be expected; &s;ince the Buildings there &s;tand
high, and are not &s;heltered, as they are in the
Streets, one by another.</P>
<P>If I may be allow'd to give this Philo&s;opical
Account of it, I hope it may not be ab&s;urd;
that the Indraft of the Arches underneath the
Hou&s;es giving Vent to the Air, it pa&s;t there
with a more than common Current; and con|fequently
relieved the Buildings, by diverting
the Force of the Storm: I ask Pardon of the in|genious
Reader for this Opinion, if it be not re|gular,
and only pre&s;ent it to the World for
Want of a better; if tho&s;e better furni&s;hed <HI>that
Way</HI> will &s;upply us with a truer Account, I
&s;hall withdraw mine, and &s;ubmit to theirs. The
<PB N="79" REF="93">
Fact however is certain, that the Hou&s;es on the
<HI>Bridge</HI> did not &s;uffer in Proportion to the other
Places; though all mu&s;t allow, they do not &s;eem
to be &s;tronger built, than other Streets of the
&s;ame &s;ort.</P>
<P>Another Ob&s;ervation I cannot but make;
to which, as I have Hundreds of In&s;tances, &s;o
I have many more Witne&s;&s;es to the Truth of
Fact, and the uncommon Experiment has made
it the more ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>The Wind blew, during the whole Storm,
between the Points of S. W. and N. W. not
that I mean it blew at all the&s;e Points, but I
take a Latitude of Eight Points to avoid Excep|tions,
and to confirm my Argument; &s;ince
what I am in&s;i&s;ting upon, could not be a natu|ral
Cau&s;e from the Winds blowing in any of tho&s;e
particular Points.</P>
<P>If a Building &s;tood North and South, it mu&s;t
be a Con&s;equence that the Ea&s;t-&s;ide Slope of
the Roof mu&s;t be the Lee-&s;ide, lie out of the
Wind, be weather'd by the Ridge, and con&s;e|quently
receive no Damage in a direct Line.</P>
<P>But again&s;t this rational way of arguing, we
are convinced by Demon&s;tration and Experi|ment,
after which Argument mu&s;t be &s;ilent. It
was not in one Place or Two, but in many
Places; that where a Building &s;tood ranging
North and South, the Sides or Slopes of the Roof
to the Ea&s;t and the We&s;t, the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the
Roof would be &s;tript and untiled by the Vio|lence
of the Wind; and the We&s;t Side,
<PB N="80" REF="94">
which lay open to the Wind, be found and un|touch'd.</P>
<P>This,
I conceive, mu&s;t happen either where
the Building had &s;ome open Part, as Windows
or Doors to receive the Wind in the In&s;ide,
which being pu&s;ht forward by the &s;ucceeding
Particles of the Air, mu&s;t force its Way forward,
and &s;o lift off the Tiling on the Leward Side of
the Building; or it mu&s;t happen from the Po&s;i|tion
of &s;uch Building near &s;ome other higher
Place or Building, where the Wind being re|puls'd,
mu&s;t be forc'd back again in Eddies;
and con&s;equently taking the Tiles from the
lower Side of the Roof, rip them up with the
more Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>However it was, it appear'd in many Places,
the Windward Side of the Roof would be whole,
and the Leeward Side, or the Side from the
Wind, be untiled; in other Places, a high Build|ing
next the Wind has been not much hurt,
and a lower Building on the Leeward Side of the
high One clean ript, and hardly a Tile left upon
it: this is plain in the Building of <HI>Chri&s;t Church
Ho&s;pital</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> where the Building on the
We&s;t and South Side of the Cloy&s;ter was at lea&s;t
Twenty Five Foot higher than the Ea&s;t Side,
and yet the Roof of the lower Side on the
Ea&s;t was quite untiled by the Storm; and
remains at the Writing of This covered
with Deal Boards above an Hundred Foot in
Length.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="95">
The blowing down of Trees may come in for
another Article in this Part; of which, in Pro|portion
to the Quantity, here was as much as in
any Part of <HI>England:</HI> Some printed Accounts
tell us of Seventy Trees in <HI>Moorfields</HI> blown down,
which may be true; but that &s;ome of them
were Three Yards about, as is affirmed by the
Authors, I cannot allow: above a Hundred
Elms in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park,</HI> &s;ome whereof were of
&s;uch Growth, as they tell us they were planted
by Cardinal <HI>Wool&s;ey;</HI> whether that Part of it
be true or not, is little to the Matter, but
only to imply that they were very great Trees:
about <HI>Baums,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>Whitmore hou&s;e,</HI>
there were above Two Hundred Trees blown
down, and &s;ome of them of extraordinary Size
broken off in the middle.</P>
<P>And 'twas ob&s;erv'd, that in the Morning after
the Storm was abated, it blew &s;o hard, the Wo|men,
who u&s;ually go for Milk to the Cow-keep|ers
in the Villages round the City, were not
able to go along with their Pails on their Heads;
and One, that was more hardy than the re&s;t,
was blown away by the Fury of the Storm, and
forced into a Pond, but by &s;trugling hard got
out, and avoided being drowned; and &s;ome
that ventured out with Milk the Evening after,
had their Pails and Milk blown off from their
Heads.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate the Particulars
of the Damage &s;uffered, and of the Accidents
which happened under the&s;e &s;everal Heads, in
and about the City of <HI>London:</HI> The Hou&s;es
<PB N="82" REF="96">
looked like Skeletons, and an univer&s;al Air of
Horror &s;eem'd to &s;it on the Countenances of the
People; all Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eem'd to be laid a&s;ide for
the Time, and People were generally intent
upon getting Help to repair their Habitations.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God &s;o to direct things, that there
fell no Rain in any con&s;iderable Quantity, ex|cept
what fell the &s;ame Night or the en&s;uing
Day, for near Three Weeks after the Storm,
though it was a Time of the Year that is generally
dripping. Had a wet Rainy Sea&s;on followed
the Storm, the Damage which would have been
&s;uffered in and about this City to Hou&s;hold
Goods, Furniture and Merchandi&s;e, would have
been incredible, and might have equall'd all the
the re&s;t of the Calamity: but the Weather
prov'd fair and temperate for near a Month after
the Storm, which gave People a great deal of
Lei&s;ure in providing them&s;elves Shelter, and for|ti&s;ying
their Hou&s;es again&s;t the Accidents of
Weather by Deal Boards, old Tiles, Pieces of Sail
Cloth, Tarpaulin, and the like.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving &s;een an Adverti&s;ement of a De&s;ign
to perpetuate the Remembrance of the
late dreadful Storm, by publi&s;hing a Collection
of all the remarkable Accidents occa&s;ion'd by it,
and &s;uppo&s;ing the Damage done to our Church
to be none of the lea&s;t, we were willing to con|tribute
&s;omething to your De&s;ign, by &s;ending
you an Account thereof as follows.</P>
<P>We had formerly a Spire of Timber covered
with Lead, of the height of 77 Foot; which be|ing
in danger of falling, was taken down: and
in the Year 1674, with the Addition of 10
Loads of new Timber, 21 thou&s;and and 8
hundred weight of Lead, a new one was erect|ed,
100 Foot high from the Steeple, with a
Galiery at the height of 40 Foot all open, where|in
hung a Clock-Bell of between 2 and 3 hun|dred
Weight. The Spire &s;tood but 8 Yards a|bove
the Roof of the Church; and yet by the
extreme Violence of the Storm, a little before 6
in the Morning the Spire was thrown down;
<PB N="86" REF="100">
and carrying with it all the Battlements on the
Ea&s;t &s;ide, it fell upon the Church at the di&s;tance
of 28 Foot; for &s;o much is the di&s;tance between
the Steeple and the fir&s;t Breach, which is on the
North-&s;ide of the middle Roof, of the length of
17 Foot, where it brake down 9 Spars clean,
each 23 Foot long, and &s;everally &s;upported with
very &s;trong Braces. The Spire inclining to the
North, fell cro&s;s the middle Wall, and broke
off at the Gallery, the lower part falling in at
the a&s;ore&s;aid Breach, and the upper upon the
North I&s;le, which is 24 Foot wide, with a flat
Roof lately built, all new and very &s;trong: It
carried all before it from &s;ide to &s;ide, making a
Breach 37 Foot long, breaking in &s;under two
large Beams that went a-cro&s;s, which were 12
Inches broad and 15 deep, be&s;ides &s;everal other
&s;maller. Be&s;ides the&s;e two Breaches, there is a
great deal of Damage done by the Fall of great
Stones upon other parts of the Roof, as well as
by the Wind's riving up the Lead, and a third
part of the Pews broken all in pieces, every
thing falling into the Church, except the Wea|ther-cock,
which was found in the Church|yard,
at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, in the great
Path that goes cro&s;s by the Ea&s;t End of the
Church. It will co&s;t above 400 <HI>l.</HI> to make all
good as it was before. There were 3 &s;ingle
Chimneys blown down, and a Stack of 4 more
together, all about the &s;ame time; and &s;ome
others &s;o &s;haken, that they were forc'd to be
pull'd down; but, we thank God, no body
hurt, tho' one Bed was broken in pieces that
<PB N="87" REF="101">
was very o$t lain in: no body lay in it that
Night. Mo&s;t Hou&s;es &s;uffered &s;omething in their
Tiling, and generally all round the Country,
there is incredible Damage done to Churches,
Hou&s;es, and Barns.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MEeting with an Adverti&s;ement of yours in
the <HI>Gazette</HI> of <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t, I very much
approved of the De&s;ign, thinking it might be a
great Motive towards making People, when
they hear the Fate of others, return Thanks to
Almighty God for his Providence in pre&s;erving
them. I accordingly was re&s;olved to &s;end you
all I knew. The Place where I have for &s;ome
time lived is <HI>Be&s;&s;el&s;leigh,</HI> in <HI>Bark&s;hire,</HI> about four
Miles S. W. of <HI>Oxon.</HI> The Wind began with us
much about One of the Clock in the Morning,
and did not do much harm, only in untiling
Hou&s;es, blowing down a Chimney or two,
without any Per&s;on hurt, and a few Trees: but
what was $he only thing that was &s;trange, and
<PB N="88" REF="102">
to be ob&s;erved, was a very tall Elm, which was
found the next Morning &s;tanding, but perfectly
twi&s;ted round; the Root a little loo&s;en'd, but
not torn up. But what happened the Afternoon
preceding, is abundantly more &s;urprizing, and
is indeed the Intent of this Letter.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday</HI> the 26th of <HI>November,</HI> in the After|noon,
about Four of the Clock, a Country Fel|low
came running to me in a great Fright, and
very earne&s;lly entreated me to go and &s;ee a Pil|lar,
as he call'd it, in the Air, in a Field hard
by. I went with the Fellow; and when I came,
found it to be a Spout marching directly with
the Wind: and I can think of nothing I can
compare it to better than the Trunk of an Ele|phant,
which it re&s;embled, only much bigger.
It was extended to a great Length, and &s;wept
the Ground as it went, leaving a Mark behind.
It cro&s;&s;ed a Field; and what was very &s;trange
(and which I &s;hould &s;carce have been induced
to believe had I not my &s;elf &s;een it, be&s;ides &s;eve|ral
Country-men who were a&s;toni&s;h'd at it)
meeting with an Oak that &s;tood towards the
middle of the Field) &s;napped the Body of it
a&s;under. Afterwards cro&s;&s;ing a Road, it &s;uck|ed
up the Water that was in the Cart-ruts: then
coming to an old Barn, it tumbled it down,
and the Thatch that was on the Top was car|ried
about by the Wind, which was then very
high, in great confu&s;ion. After this I followed
it no farther, and therefore &s;aw no more of it.
But a Pari&s;honer of mine going from hence to
<HI>Hink&s;ey,</HI> in a Field about a quarter of a Mile off
<PB N="89" REF="103">
of this Place, was on the &s;udden knock'd down,
and lay upon the Place till &s;ome People came by
and brought him home; and he is not yet quite
recovered. Having examined him, by all I can
collect both from the Time, and Place, and Man|ner
of his being knock'd down, I mu&s;t conclude
it was done by the Spout, which, if its Force
had not been much abated, had certainly kill'd
him: and indeed I attribute his Illne&s;s more to
the Fright, than the &s;udden Force with which
he was &s;truck down.</P>
<P>I will not now enter into a Di&s;&s;ertation on the
Cau&s;e of Spouts, but by what I can under&s;tand
they are cau&s;ed by nothing but the Circumgy|ration
of the Clouds, made by two contrary
Winds meeting in a Point, and conden&s;ing the

<P>HAving &s;een in the <HI>Gazettee</HI> an Intimation,
that there would be a Memorial drawn
up of the late terrible Wind, and the Effects of
it, and that the Compo&s;er de&s;ired Informations
from credible Per&s;ons, the better to enable him
to do the &s;ame, I thought good to intimate what
happen'd in this Town, and its Neighbourhood.
1. The Weather-cock of <HI>All-Saints</HI> Church being
placed on a mighty Spindle of Iron, was bowed
together, and made u&s;ele&s;s. Many Sheets of
Lead on that Church, as al&s;o on St. <HI>Giles's</HI> and
St. <HI>Sepulehres,</HI> rowled up like a Scroll. Three
Windmills belonging to the Town blown down,
to the Amazement of all Beholders; the mighty
upright Po&s;t below the Floor of the Mills being
&s;napt in two like a Reed. Two entire Stacks of
Chimneys in a Hou&s;e uninhabited fell on two
&s;everal Roofs, and made a mo&s;t amazing Ruin
in the Chambers, Floors, and even to the lower
<PB N="91" REF="105">
Windows and Wain&s;cot, &s;plitting and tearing it
as if a Blow by Gun-powder had happen'd. The
Floods at this in&s;tant about the South Bridge,
from a violent S. W. Wind, ro&s;e to a great and
amazing height; the Wind coming over or a|thwart
large open Meadows, did exceeding da|mage
in that part of the Town, by blowing
down &s;ome whole Hou&s;es, carrying whole Roofs
at once into the Streets, and very many le&s;&s;er
Buildings of Tanners, Fell-mongers, Dyers,
Glue-makers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet, through the Goodne&s;s of
God, no Per&s;on killed or maimed: the mighty
Doors of the Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e, barr'd and lock'd,
forced open, whereby the Wind entring, made
a mi&s;erable Havock of the large and lofty Win|dows:
a Pinnacle on the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> with the
Fane, was al&s;o blown down. To &s;peak of Hou|&s;es
&s;hatter'd, Corn-ricks and Hovels blown from
their Standings, would be endle&s;s. In Sir <HI>Tho|mas
Samwell's</HI> Park a very great headed Elm was
blown over the Park-Wall into the Road, and
yet never touched the Wall, being carried &s;ome
Yards. I have confined my &s;elf to this Town.
If the Compo&s;er finds any thing agreeable to his
De&s;ign, he may u&s;e it or di&s;mi&s;s it at his Di&s;|cretion.
Such Works of Providence are worth

<P>THIS Pari&s;h is a very large one in the Coun|ty
of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> on one Side whereof run|neth
the River <HI>Severn,</HI> which by Rea&s;on of the
Violence of the late Storm beat down and tore
to pieces the Sea Wall (which is made of great
Stones, and Sticks which they call Rou&s;es, a Yard
and half long, about the Bigne&s;s of ones Thigh ram|med
into the Ground as firm as po&s;&s;ible) in many
Places, and levell'd it almo&s;t with the Ground,
forcing va&s;t Quantities of Earth a great Di&s;tance
from the Shore, and Stones, many of which
were above a Hundred Weight: and hereby the
<HI>Severn</HI> was let in above a Mile over one part of
the Pari&s;h, and did great Damage to the Land;
it carried away one Hou&s;e which was by the
Sea-&s;ide, and a Gentleman's Stable, wherein
was a Hor&s;e, into the next Ground; and then
the Stable fell to pieces, and &s;o the Hor&s;e came
out. There is one thing more remarkable in
this Pari&s;h, and 'tis this: Twenty Six Sheets of
<PB N="93" REF="107">
Lead, hanging all together, were blown off from
the middle I&s;le of our Church, and were carried
over the North I&s;le, which is a very large one,
without touching it; and into the Church-yard
ten Yards di&s;tant from the Church; and they
were took up all joyned together as they were
on the Roof; the Plummer told me that the
Sheets weighed each Three Hundred and a half
one with another. This is what is mo&s;t ob&s;ervable
in our Pari&s;h; but I &s;hall give you an Account of
one thing (which perhaps you may have from
other Hands) that happen'd in another, call'd
<HI>King&s;cote,</HI> a little Village about Three Miles
from <HI>Tedbury,</HI> and Seven from us; where <HI>Willi|am
King&s;cote</HI> E&s;&abque; has many Woods; among
which was one Grove of very tall Trees, being
each near Eighty Foot high; the which he great|ly
valued for the Tallne&s;s and Pro&s;pect of them,
and therefore re&s;olv'd never to cut them down:
But it &s;o happen'd, that Six Hundred of them,
within the Compa&s;s of Five Acres were whol|ly
blown down; (and &s;uppos'd to be much at
the &s;ame time) each Tree tearing up the Ground
with its Root; &s;o that the Roots of mo&s;t of the
Trees, with the Turf and Earth about them,
&s;tood up at lea&s;t Fifteen or Sixteen Foot high;
the lying down of which Trees is an amazing
Sight to all Beholders. This Account was gi|ven

remarkable; who was killed by the Fall of two
Chimney Stacks, which fell on the Roof, and
drove it in upon my Lord's Bed, forced it
quite through the next Flower down into the

who was found in her Bed; but my Lord had
his Morning Gown on, &s;o that 'tis &s;uppos'd he

Hou&s;e; and &s;everal other Chimney Stacks fell

abundance of Tiles are blown off, and likewi&s;e
Thatch in and about this Town, and &s;everal
Hou&s;es uncover'd, in the Country all about us,
abundance of Apple and Elm Trees are rooted

<P>IN Obedience to your Reque&s;t I have here
&s;ent you a particular Account of the da|mages
&s;u&s;tain'd in our Pari&s;h by the late Vio|lent
Storm; and becau&s;e that of our Church is
the mo&s;t material which I have to impart to
you, I &s;hall therefore begin with it. It is the
finene&s;s of our Church which magnifies our
pre&s;ent lo&s;s, for in the whole it is a large and
noble &s;tructure, compos'd within and without
of A&s;hler curiou&s;ly wrought, and con&s;i&s;ting
of a &s;tately Roof in the middle, and two
I&s;les runing a con&s;iderable length from one
end of it to the other, makes a very beautiful
Figure. It is al&s;o adorn'd with 28 admired
and Celebrated Windows, which, for the va|riety
and finene&s;s of the Painted Gla&s;s that was
in them, do ju&s;tly attract the Eyes of all cu|rious
Travellers to in&s;pect and behold them;
nor is it more famous for its Gla&s;s, than new|ly
renown'd for the Beauty of its Seats and
Paving, both being chiefly the noble Gift of
that pious and worthy Gentleman <HI>Andrew Bar|ker,</HI>
E&s;&abque; the late Deceas'd Lord of the Man
nor. So that all things con&s;ider'd, it does
equal, at lea&s;t, if not exceed, any Parochial
Church in <HI>England.</HI> Now that part of it
which mo&s;t of all felt the fury of the Winds,
was, a large middle We&s;t Window, in Dimen|&s;ion
about 15 Foot wide, and 25 Foot high;
<PB N="98" REF="112">
it repre&s;ents the general Judgment, and is &s;o
fine a piece of Art, that 1500 <HI>l.</HI> has formerly
been bidden for it, a price, though very temp|ting,
yet were the Pari&s;honers &s;o ju&s;t and ho|ne&s;t
as to refu&s;e it. The upper part of this
Window, ju&s;t above the place where our Sa|viour's,
Picture is drawn &s;itting on a Rain|bow,
and the Earth his Foot-&s;tool, is entirely
ruin'd, and both &s;ides are &s;o &s;hatter'd and
torn, e&s;pecially the left, that upon a general
Computation, a fourth part, at lea&s;t, is blown
down and de&s;troy'd. The like Fate has ano|ther
We&s;t Window on the left &s;ide of the
former, in Dimen&s;ion about 10 Foot broad,
and 15 Foot high, &s;u&s;tain'd; the upper half
of which is totally broke, excepting one Stone
Mannel. Now if this were but ordinary
Gla&s;s, we might quickly compute what our
repairs would Co&s;t, but we the more lament
our misfortune herein, becau&s;e the Paint of
the&s;e two, as of all the other Windows in our
Church, is &s;tain'd thro' the Body of the Gla&s;s;
&s;o that if that be true which is generaly &s;aid,
that this Art is lo&s;t, than have we an irretrie|vable
lo&s;s. There are other damages about
our Church, which, tho' not &s;o great as the
former, do yet as much te&s;tify how &s;trong
and boi&s;terous the Winds were, for they un|bedded
3 Sheets of Lead upon the uppermo&s;t
Rooff, and roll'd them up like &s;o much Paper,
Over the Church-porch, a large Pinnacle and
two Battlements were blown down upon the
<PB N="99" REF="113">
leads of it, but re&s;ting there, and their fall be|ing
&s;hort, the&s;e will be repair'd with little
Co&s;t. This is all I have to &s;ay concerning
our Church: Our Hou&s;es come next to be
con&s;idered, and here I may tell you, that
(thanks be to God) the effects of the Storm
were not &s;o great as they have been in many
other places; &s;everal Chimneys, and Tiles,
and Slats, were thrown down, but no body
kill'd or wounded. Some of the Poor, be|cau&s;e
their Hou&s;es were Thatch'd, were the
great&s;t &s;ufferers; but to be particular here|in,
would be very frivolous, as well as vexa|tious.
One In&s;tance of Note ought not to
omitted; on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 26th, being the day
after the Storm, about 2-a-Clock in the After|noon,
without any previous warning, a &s;ud|den
fla&s;h of Lightning, with a &s;hort, but vio|lent
clap of Thunder, immediately following
it like the Di&s;charge of Ordnance, fell upon
a new and &s;trong built Hou&s;e in the middle of
our Town, and at the &s;ame of the Lead of an
upper Window, and &s;truck the Mi&s;tre&s;s of
the Hou&s;e into a Swoon, but this, as appear'd
afterwards, prov'd the effect more of fear,
than of any real con&s;iderable hurt to be found
about her. I have nothing more to add, unle&s;s
it be the fall of &s;everal Trees and Ricks of
Hay among&s;t us, but the&s;e being &s;o common
every where, and not very many in number

the mo&s;t particular Things that hapned in the
late dreadful Tempe&s;t of Wind, and in the

of mine, that was an Exci&s;eman of <HI>Ax|bridge,</HI>
in the We&s;t of our Country of <HI>somer-&s;at:</HI>
the&s;e are his Words,</P>
<P>What I know of the Winds in the&s;e Parts,
are, that it broke down many Trees, and that
the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Richard Henden, of Charter|Hou&s;e</HI>
on <HI>Mendip,</HI> call'd <HI>Piney,</HI> was almo&s;t
<PB N="101" REF="115">
blown down, and in &s;aving their Hou&s;e, they,
and the Servants, and others, heard grievous
Cries and Scrieches in the Air. The Tower of
<HI>Compt$n Bi&s;hop</HI> was much &s;hatter'd and the
Leads that cover'd it were taken clean away,
and laid flat in the Church-Yard: The Hou&s;e
of <HI>John Cray</HI> of that place, received much and
&s;trange Damages, which together with his
part in the Sea-wall, amounted to 500 <HI>l.</HI>
Near the Salt-works in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Burnham,</HI>
was driven five trading Ve&s;&s;els, as Colliers
and Corn-dealers, betwixt <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Bridg|water,</HI>
at lea&s;t 100 Yards on Pa&s;ture Ground.
In the North Mar&s;h, on the &s;ides of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>
River, near <HI>Ken</HI> at <HI>Walton Wood&s;pring,</HI> the
Waters broke with &s;uch Violence, that it came
&s;ix Miles into the Country drowning much
Cattel, carrying away &s;everal Hay-ricks and
Stacks of Corn: And at a Farm at <HI>Churchill</HI>
near <HI>Wrington,</HI> it blew down 150 Elms that
grew mo&s;t in Rows, and were laid as Uniform
as Soldiers lodge their Arms.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cheddar</HI> near <HI>Axbridge,</HI> was much harm
done in Apple-trees, Hou&s;es, and &s;uch like;
but what's worth remark, tho' not the very
Night of the Tempe&s;t, a Company of wicked
People being at a Wedding of one <HI>Thomas Mar|&s;hall,
John,</HI> the Father of the &s;aid <HI>Thomas,</HI> be|ing
as mo&s;t of the Company was very Drunk,
after much filthy Di&s;cour&s;e while he was eat|ing,
a &s;trange Cat pulling &s;omething from his
<PB N="102" REF="116">
Trenchard, he Cur&s;ing her, &s;toopt to take it
up, and died immediately.</P>
<P>At <HI>Brewton</HI> what was mo&s;t Remarkable,
was this, that one <HI>John Dicer</HI> of that Town, lay
the Night as the Tempe&s;t was, in the Barn
of one <HI>John Seller,</HI> the Violence of the Wind
broke down the Roof of the Barn, but fortu|nately
for him there was a Ladder which &s;taid up
a Rafter, which would have fell upon the &s;aid
<HI>John Dicer;</HI> but he narrowly e&s;caping being
killed, did &s;lide him&s;elf thro' the broken Roof,
and &s;o got over the Wall without any great
hurt. What hurt was done more about that
Town is not &s;o con&s;iderable as in other Places;
Such as blowing off the Thatch from a great
many back Hou&s;es of the Town; for the
Town is mo&s;t tiled with a &s;ort of heavy Tile,
that the Wind had no power to move; there
was &s;ome hurt done to the Church, which was
not above 40 <HI>s.</HI> be&s;ides the Windows, where
was a con&s;iderable damage, the Lady <HI>Fitzhard|ing's</HI>
Hou&s;e &s;tanding by the-Church, the Bat|tlement
with part of the Wall of the Hou&s;e
was blown down, which 'tis &s;aid, above 20
Men with all their &s;trength could not have
thrown down; be&s;ides, a great many Trees
in the Park torn up by the Roots, and laid in
very good Order one after another; it was
taken notice that the Wind did not come in a
full Body at once, but it came in &s;everal Gu&s;ts,

Country, that in half a Miles riding I could

then again I might for &s;ome &s;pace &s;ee the
Trees down, and all the Hou&s;es &s;hattred: and
I have taken Notice that it run &s;o all up the
Country in &s;uch a Line as the Wind &s;at; about
One of the Clock it turn'd to the North We&s;t,
but at the beginning was at South We&s;t;
I my &s;elf was up until One and then I went
to Bed, but the highe&s;t of the Wind was af|ter
that, &s;o that my Bed did &s;hake with me.</P>
<P>What was about <HI>Wincanton,</HI> was, that one
Mrs. <HI>Gapper</HI> had 36 Elm-trees growing toge|ther
in a Row, 35 of them was blown down;
and one <HI>Eage$ill</HI> of the &s;ame Town, and his

Hou&s;e begin to Crak, and got out of the Doors
with his whole Family, and as &s;oon as they
were out the Roof of the Hou&s;e fell in, and
the Violence of the Wind took of the Chil|dren's
Head-cloaths, that they never &s;aw them
afterwards.</P>
<P>At <HI>Evercreech,</HI> three Miles from <HI>Brew$on,</HI>
there were a poor Woman beg'd for Lodging
in the Barn of one <HI>Edmond Pe$</HI> that &s;ame
Night that the Storm was, &s;he was wet the
Day before in Travelling, &s;o &s;he hung up her
Cloaths in the Barn, and lay in the Straw;
but when the Storm came it blew down the
Roof of the Barn where &s;he lay, and &s;he nar|rowly
e&s;caped with her Life, being much
<PB N="104" REF="118">
brui&s;ed, and got out almo&s;t naked through
the Roof where it was broken mo&s;t, and went
to the dwelling Hou&s;e of the &s;aid <HI>Edmond Pe|ny,</HI>
and they did ari&s;e, and did help her to
&s;omething to cover her, till they could get
out her Cloaths; that place of <HI>Evercreech</HI> re|ceived
a great deal of hurt in their Hou&s;es,
which is too large to put here.</P>
<P>At <HI>Batcomb</HI> Ea&s;terly of <HI>Evercreech,</HI> they had
a great deal of Damage done as I &s;aid before, it
lay exactly with the Wind from <HI>Evercreech,</HI>
and both places received a great deal of Da|mage;
there was one Widow <HI>Walter</HI> lived in a
Hou&s;e by it &s;elf, the Wind carried away the
Roof, and the Woman's pair of Bodice, that
was never heard of again, and the whole Fa|mily
e&s;caped narrowly with their Lives; all
the Battlements of the Church on that &s;ide of
the Tower next to the Wind was blown in,
and a great deal of Damage done to the
Church.</P>
<P>At <HI>Shipton Mallet</HI> was great Damages done,
as I was told by the Po&s;t that comes to <HI>Brew|ton,</HI>
that the Tiles of the Meeting Hou&s;e was
blown off, and being a &s;ort of light Tiles they
flew again&s;t the Neighbouring Windows, and
broke them to pieces: And at <HI>Chalton</HI> near
<HI>Shepton Mallet</HI> at one <HI>Abbot's,</HI> the Roof was
carried from the Walls of the Hou&s;e, and the
Hou&s;e mightily &s;haken, and &s;eemingly the Foun|dation
removed, and in the Morning they
<PB N="105" REF="119">
found a Foundation Stone of the Hou&s;e upon
the top of the Wall, where was a &s;hew in the
Ground of its being driven out. At <HI>Dinder</HI>
within two Miles of <HI>Shepton,</HI> there was one
<HI>John Allen,</HI> and his Son, being out of Doors
in the mid&s;t of the Tempe&s;t, they &s;aw a great
Body of Fire flying on the &s;ide of a Hill,
call'd <HI>Dinder-hill,</HI> about half a Mile from
them, with a Shew of black in the mid&s;t of it,
and another Body of Fire following it, &s;ome|thing
&s;maller than the former.</P>
<P>There has been a &s;trange thing at <HI>Butly,</HI>
eight Miles from <HI>Brewton,</HI> which was thought
to be Witchcraft, where a great many unu&s;ual
Things happened to one <HI>Pope,</HI> and his Family,
e&s;pecially to a Boy, that was his Son, that
having lain &s;everal Hours Dead, when he
came to him&s;elf, he told his Father, and &s;eve|ral
of his Neighbours, &s;trange Stories of his
being carried away by &s;ome of his Neigh|bours
that have been counted wicked Per&s;ons;
the Things have been &s;o &s;trangely related
that Thou&s;ands of People have gone to &s;ee
and hear it; it la&s;ted about a Year or more:
But &s;ince the Storm I have inquired of the
Neighbours how it was, and they tell me,
that &s;ince the late Tempe&s;t of Wind the Hou&s;e
and People have been quiet; for its generally
&s;aid, that there was &s;ome Conjuration in quiet|ing
of that Hou&s;e. If you have a de&s;ire to hear

<P>I Received yours, de&s;iring an Account of
the Damage done by the late great Wind
about us. At <HI>Wil&s;norton,</HI> three Miles from
<HI>Wittney,</HI> the Lead of the Church was rouled,
and great Damage done to the Church, many
great. Elms were tore up by the Roots: At
<HI>Helford,</HI> two Miles from us, a Rookery of
Elms, was mo&s;t of it tore up by the Roots:
At <HI>Cockeup,</HI> two Miles from us, was a Barn
blown down, and &s;everal Elms blown down
a Cro&s;s the High-way, &s;o that there was no
pa&s;&s;age; a great Oak of about nine or ten
Loads was blown down, having a Raven &s;itting
in it, his Wing-feathers got between two Bows,
and held him fa&s;t; but the Raven received no
hurt: At <HI>Duckelton,</HI> a little thatch't Hou&s;e
was taken off the Ground-pening, and remov|ed
a di&s;tance from the place, the covering not
damaged. Hay-recks abundance are torn to
pieces: At <HI>Wittney,</HI> &s;ix Stacks of Chimneys
<PB N="107" REF="121">
blown down, one Hou&s;e had a &s;heet of Lead
taken from one &s;ide and blown over to the o|ther,
and many Hou&s;es were quite torn to pieces;
&s;everal Hundred Trees blown down, &s;ome
broke in the middle, and &s;ome torn up by the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Brief but exact Remarks on the late Dreadful
Storms of Wind, as it affected the Town, and
the Parts adjacent.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IMPRIMUS.</HI> At <HI>A&s;hil</HI>- Pari&s;h 3 Miles We&s;t
from this Town, the Stable belonging
to the Hare and Hounds Inn was blown down.
in which were three Hor&s;es, one kill'd, ano|ther
very much brui&s;ed.</P>
<P>2. At <HI>Jurdans,</HI> a Gentleman's S$at in the
&s;ame Pari&s;h, there was a Brick Stable, who&s;e
Roof, one Back, and one End Wall, were all
thrown down, and four foot in depth of the
Fore Wall; in this Stable were 4 Hor&s;es, which
by rea&s;on of the Hay-loft that bore up the
Roof, were all pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="122">
3. At <HI>Sevington</HI> Pari&s;h, three Miles Ea&s;t
from this Town, <HI>John Hutkens</HI> had the Roof
of a new built Hou&s;e heaved clean off the
Walls. <HI>Note,</HI> the Hou&s;e was not glazed, and
the Roof was thatch'd.</P>
<P>4. In <HI>White Larkington</HI> Park, a Mile Ea&s;t
from this Town, be&s;ides four or five hundred
tall Trees broken and blown down, (admira|ble
to behold, what great Roots was turned
up) there were three very large Beaches, two
of them that were near five Foot thick in the
Stem were broken off, one of them near the
Root, the other was broken off twelve Foot
above, and from that place down home to the
Root was &s;hattered and flown; the other that
was not broken, cannot have le&s;s than forty
Waggon Loads in it; a very fine Walk of Trees
before the Hou&s;e all blown down, and broke
down the Roof of a Pidgeon Hou&s;e, the Rooke|ry
carried away in Lanes, the Lodg-Hou&s;e da|maged
in the Roof, and one End by the fall of
Trees. In the Garden belonging to the Hou&s;e,
was a very fine Walk of tall Firrs, twenty of
which were broken down.</P>
<P>5. The damage in the Thatch of Hou&s;es,
(which is the u&s;ual Covering in the&s;e Parts)
is &s;o great and general, that the price of Reed
aro&s;e from twenty Shillings to fifty or three
Pounds a Hundred; in&s;omuch that to &s;helter
them&s;elves from the open Air, many poor
People were glad to u&s;e Bean, Helm and Fur&s;e
to thatch their Hou&s;es with, Things
<PB N="109" REF="123">
never known to be put to &s;uch U&s;e before.</P>
<P>6. At <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> a Mile di&s;tance from this
Town, the Church was very much &s;hattered
in its Roof, and Walls too, and all our Coun|try
Churches much &s;hattered, &s;o that Churches
and Gentlemen's Hou&s;es which were tiled,
were &s;o &s;hattered in their Roofs, that at pre|&s;ent,
they are generally patch'd with Reed,
not in Compliance with the Mode, but the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of the Times.</P>
<P>7. At <HI>Broadway,</HI> two Miles We&s;t of this
Town, <HI>Hugh Betty,</HI> his Wife, and four Chil|dren
being in his Hou&s;e, it was by the vio|lence
of the Storm blown down, one of his
Children killed, his Wife wounded, but reco|vered,
the re&s;t e&s;caped with their Lives. A
large Alms-Hou&s;es had mo&s;t of the Tile blown
off, and other Hou&s;es much &s;hattered; a very
large Brick Barn blown down, Walls and Roof
to the Ground.</P>
<P>8. Many large Stacks of Wheat were broken,
&s;ome of the Sheaves carried two or three Hun|dred
Yards from the Place, many Stacks of
Hay turned over, &s;ome Stacks of Corn heaved
off the Stadle, and &s;et down on the Ground,
and not broken.</P>
<P>9. <HI>Dowli&s;h Walk,</HI> two Miles South Ea&s;t,
the Church was very much &s;hattered, &s;everal
Load of Stones fell down, not as yet repair'd,
therefore can't expre&s;s the damage. A very
large Barn broken down that &s;tood near the
<PB N="110" REF="124">
Church, much damage was done to Orchards,
not only in this Place, but in all places round,
&s;ome very fine Orchards quite de&s;troyed;
&s;ome to their great Co&s;t had the Trees &s;et up
right again, but a Storm of Wind came after,
which threw down many of the Trees again;
as to Timber Trees, almo&s;t all our high Trees
were broken down in that violent Storm.</P>
<P>10. In this Town <HI>Henry Dun&s;ter,</HI> his Wife
and 2 Children, was in their Hou&s;e when it was
blown down, but they all e&s;caped with their
Lives, only one of them had a &s;mall Brui&s;e
with a piece of Timber, as &s;he was going out
of the Chamber when the Roof broke in.</P>
<P>The Church, in this Place, &s;cap'd very well,
as to its Roof, being cover'd with Lead only
on the Chancel; the Lead was at the top of
the Roof heaved up, and roll'd together, more
than ten Men could turn back again, without
cutting the Sheets of Lead, which was done
to put it in its place again: But in general the
Hou&s;es much broken and &s;hatter'd, be&s;ides the
fall of &s;ome.</P>
<P>This is a &s;hort, but true Account. I have
heard of &s;everal other things which I have not
mentioned, becau&s;e I could not be po&s;itive in
the truth of them, unle&s;s I had &s;een it. This is
what I have been to &s;ee the truth of. You may
enlarge on the&s;e &s;hort Heads, and methodize
'em as you &s;ee good.</P>
<P>At <HI>Henton St. George,</HI> at the Lord <HI>Pawlet's,</HI>
a new Brick Wall was broken down by the
<PB N="111" REF="125">
Wind for above 100 $oot, the Wall being built
not above 2 years &s;ince, as al&s;o above 60 Trees
near 100 foot high.</P>
<P>At <HI>Barrington,</HI> about 2 miles North of this
Town, there was blown down above eight|&s;core
Trees, being of an extraordinary height,
at the Lady <HI>Strouds.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As the Undertaking you are engag'd in,
to pre&s;erve the Remembrance of the late
dreadful Tempe&s;t, is very commendable in it
&s;elf, and may in &s;everal re&s;pects be &s;erviceable
not only to the pre&s;ent Age, but al&s;o to Po|&s;terity;
&s;o it merits a &s;uitable Encouragement,
and, 'tis hop'd, it will meet with &s;uch, from all
that have either a true &s;en&s;e of Religion, or
<PB N="112" REF="126">
have had any &s;en&s;ible &s;hare of the care of Pro|vidence
over them, or of the goodne&s;s of God
unto them in the Land of the Living, upon
that occa&s;ion. There are doubtle&s;s va&s;t num|bers
of People in all Parts (where the Tem|pe&s;t
raged) that have the greate&s;t rea&s;on (as
the Author of this Paper for one hath) to ble&s;s
God for their wonderful pre&s;ervation, and to
tell it to the Generation following. But to
detain you no longer with Preliminaries, I
&s;hall give you a faithful Account of what oc|curr'd
in my Neighbourhood (according to
the Conditions mention'd in the Adverti&s;e|ment
in the <HI>Gazette</HI>) worthy, at lea&s;t, of my
notice, if not of the Undertakers; and I can
a&s;&s;ure you, that the &s;everal Particulars were
either &s;uch as I can vouch-for on my own cer|tain
Knowledge and Ob&s;ervation, or el&s;e &s;uch
as I am &s;atisfy'd of the truth of by the Te&s;ti|mony
of others, who&s;e Integrity I have no
rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect. I will &s;ay no more than
this in general, concerning the Storm, that, at
its height, it &s;eem'd, for &s;ome hours, to be a
perfect Hurrican, the Wind raging from every
Quarter, e&s;pecially from all the Points of
the Compa&s;s, from <HI>N. E.</HI> to the <HI>N. W.</HI> as the
di&s;mal Effects of it in the&s;e Parts do evident|ly
demon&s;trate, in the demoli&s;hing of Buil|dings
(or impairing 'em at be&s;t) and in the
throwing up $a&s;t numbers of Trees by the
Roots, or &s;napping them off in their Bodies,
or larger Limbs. But as to &s;ome remarkable
<PB N="113" REF="127">
Particulars, you may take the&s;e following,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. The Pari&s;h-Church receiv'd little dam|mage,
tho' it &s;tands high, the chief was in &s;ome
of the Windows on the N. &s;ide, and in the fall of
the Top-&s;tone of one of the Pinnacles, which fell
on a Hou&s;e adjoining to the Tower with little
hurt to the Roof, from which glancing it re&s;t|ed
on the Leads of the South-I&s;le of the
Church. At the fall of it an aged Woman li|ving
in the &s;aid Hou&s;e on which the Stone fell,
heard horrible Scrieches (as &s;he con&s;tantly a|verrs)
in the Air, but none before nor after|wards.</P>
<P>2.
Two &s;tone Chimney-tops were thrown
down, and 2 broad Stones of each of them lay
at even poize on the re&s;pective ridges of both
the Hou&s;es, and tho' the Wind &s;at full again&s;t
one of them to have thrown it off, (and then
it had fallen over a Door, in and out at which
&s;everal People were pa&s;&s;ing during the Storm)
and tho' the other fell again&s;t the Wind, yet
neither of the &s;aid Stones &s;tirr'd.</P>
<P>3. A Stone of near 400 Weight, having
lain about 7 Years under a Bank, defended
from the Wind as it then &s;ate, tho' it lay &s;o
long as to be fix'd in the ground, and was as
much out of the Wind, as could be, being
fenced by the Bank, and a low Stone-wall up|on
the Bank, none of which was demoli&s;h'd,
tho' 2 &s;mall Holms &s;tanding in the Bank be|tween
the Wall, and the Stone, at the foot of
<PB N="114" REF="128">
the Bank were blown up by the roots; I &s;ay,
this Stone, tho' thus fenced from the Storm,
was carried from the place where it lay, into
an hollow-way beneath, at lea&s;t &s;even Yards
from the place, where it was known to have
lain for 7 Years before.</P>
<P>4. A Widdow-woman living in one part of
an Hou&s;e by her &s;elf, kept her Bed till the
Hou&s;e over her was uncover'd, and &s;he ex|pected
the fall of the Timber and Walls; but
getting below Stairs in the dark, and open|ing
the Door to fly for &s;helter, the Wind was
&s;o &s;trong in the Door, that &s;he could neither
get out at it, tho' &s;he attempted to go out
on her knees and hands, nor could &s;he &s;hut
the Door again with all her &s;trenght, but was
forced to &s;it alone for &s;everal hours ('till the
Storm &s;lacken'd,) fearing every Gu&s;t would
have buried her in the Ruins; and yet it
pleas'd God to pre&s;erve her, for the Hou&s;e
(tho' a feeble one) &s;tood over the Storm.</P>
<P>5. Another, who made Malt in his Barn,
had been turning his Malt &s;ometime before
the Storm was at its height, and another of the
Family being de&s;irous to go again into the
&s;aid Barn &s;ometime after, was di&s;&s;waded from
it, and immediately thereupon the &s;aid Barn
was thrown down by the Storm.</P>
<P>6. But a much narrower E&s;cape had one,
for who&s;e &s;afety the Collector of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;a|ges
has the greate&s;t rea&s;on to ble&s;s and prai&s;e
the great Pre&s;erver of Men, who was twice
<PB N="115" REF="129">
in his Bed that di&s;mal Night (tho' he had
warning &s;ufficient to deter him the fir&s;t time
by the falling of &s;ome of the Seiling on his
Back and Shoulders, as he was preparing to
go to Bed) and was altogether in&s;en&s;ible of
the great danger he was in, 'till the next morn|ing
after the Day-light appear'd, when he
found the Tiles, on the &s;ide of the Hou&s;e op|po&s;ite
to the main Stre&s;s of the Weather,
blown up in two places, one of which was o|ver
his Beds-head (about 9 foot above it) in
which 2 or 3 Laths being broken, let down
a Square of 8 or 10 Stone Tiles upon one
&s;ingle Lath, where they hung dropping in|ward
a little, and bended the Lath like a Bow,
but fell not: What the con&s;equence of their
Fall had been, was obvious to as many as &s;aw
it, and none has more rea&s;on to magnify God's
great Goodne&s;s, in this re&s;cue of his Providence,
than the Relater.</P>
<P>7. A young Man of the &s;ame Pari&s;h, who
was &s;ent abroad to look after &s;ome black Cat|tle
and Sheep that fed in an Inclo&s;ure, in, or
near to which there were &s;ome Stacks of
Corn blown down, reports, That tho' he had
much difficulty to find the Inclo&s;ure in the
dark, and to get thither by rea&s;on of the Tem|pe&s;t
then raging in the height of its fury;
yet being there, he &s;aw a mighty Body of Fire
on an high ridge of Hills, about 3 parts of a
Mile from the &s;aid Inclo&s;ure, which gave $o
clear a Light into the Valley below, as that
<PB N="116" REF="130">
by it the &s;aid young Man could di&s;tinctly de|&s;cry
all the Sheep and Cattle in the &s;aid Pa|&s;ture,
&s;o as to perceive there was not one
wanting.</P>
<P>8. At <HI>A&s;hegrove,</HI> in the &s;ame Pari&s;h (where
many tall Trees were &s;tanding on the &s;teep &s;ide
of an Hill) there were two Trees of con&s;iderable
bigne&s;s blown up again&s;t the &s;ide of the Hill,
which &s;eems &s;omewhat &s;trange, to &s;uch as
have &s;een how many are blown, at the &s;ame
place, a quite contrary way, <HI>i. e.</HI> down the
Hill; and to fall downwards was to fall with
the Wind, as upward, was to fall again&s;t it.</P>
<P>9. One in this Neighbourhood had a Pop|lar
in his Back-&s;ide of near 16 Yards high
blown down, which &s;tanding near a &s;mall
Current of Water, the Roots brought up near
a Tun of Earth with them, and there the Tree
lay for &s;ome days after the Storm; but when
the Top or Head of the Tree was &s;aw'd off
from the Body (tho' the Boughs were nothing
to the weight of the But End, yet) the Tree
mounted, and fell back into its place, and
&s;tood as upright without its Head, as ever it
had done with it. And the &s;ame happen'd
at the Lady <HI>Banks</HI> her Hou&s;e near <HI>Sha&s;tsbury,</HI>
where a Wall-nut-Tree was thrown down
in a place that declin'd &s;omewhat, and after
the greater Limbs had been cut off in the day
time, went back in the Night following, of it
&s;elf, and now &s;tands in the &s;ame place and
po&s;$ure it &s;tood in before it was blown down.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="131">
I &s;aw it &s;tanding the 16th of this In&s;tant, and
could hardly perceive any Token of its hav|ing
been Down, &s;o very exactly it &s;ell
back into it's place. This is &s;omewhat the
more remarkable, becau&s;e the Ground (as I
&s;aid) was declining, and con&s;equently the
Tree rai&s;ed again&s;t the Hill. To this I &s;hall
only add, at pre&s;ent, that</P>
<P>10. This Relator lately riding thro' a neigh|bouring
Pari&s;h, &s;aw two Trees near two Hou|les
thrown be&s;ides the &s;aid Hou&s;es, and very
near each Hou&s;e, which yet did little or no
harm, when if they had fallen with the Wind,
they mu&s;t needs have fallen directly upon the
&s;aid Hou&s;es. And</P>
<P>11. That this Relator had two very tall
Elms thrown up by the Roots, which fell in
among five young Walnut Trees, without in|juring
a Twig or Bud of either of them, as
rais'd the admiration of &s;uch as &s;aw it.</P>
<P>12. In the &s;ame place, the Top of another
Elm yet &s;tanding, was carry'd of from the
Body of the Tree, a good part of 20 Yards.</P>
<P><HI>SIR;</HI> I &s;hall trouble you no further at pre|&s;ent,

too much; but however that may be, you, or

<P>Publick notice being given of a de&s;igned

for it may very well be thought to have a
good Influence both upon the pre&s;ent Age,
and &s;ucceeding Generation, to beget in them
a holy admiration and fear of that tremendous
Power and Maje&s;ty, which as one Prophet
tells us, <HI>Cau&s;eth the Vapours to a&s;cend from the
Ends of the Earth, and bringeth the Wind out of
his Trea&s;ures, and as the Prie&s;t &s;aith, hath &s;o

Providence of God all e&s;caped with their
Lives and Limbs, and the main Fabrick of
their Hou&s;es &s;tood; tho' with much &s;haking,

and many mighty Elms being torn up, and
one Elm above the re&s;t, of very great Bulk and
ancient Growth I ob&s;erved, which might have
defied the Strength of all the Men and Teams
in the Pari&s;h, (tho' a&s;&s;aulted in every Branch

another great Elm its Fellow, and next Neigh|bour.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find in the Adverti&s;ments a De&s;ire to have
an Account of what happen'd remarkable
in the late terrible Storm in the Country; the
Stories every where are very many, and &s;eve|ral
of them &s;uch as will &s;carce gain Credit; one
of them I &s;end here an Account of being an
Eye Witne&s;s, and living upon the place: The
Storm here began on the 26th of <HI>Novem.</HI> 1703.
about 12-a-clock, but the &s;evere&s;t Bla&s;ts were
between 5 and &s;ix in the Morning, and between
Eight and Nine the 27th I went up to the
Church, where I found all the middle I&s;le
clearly &s;tript of the Lead from one End to
the other, and a great many of the Sheets
lying on the Ea&s;t End upon the Church, roll'd
up like a piece of Cloth: I found on the
Ground &s;ix Sheets of Lead, at lea&s;t 50 Hun|dred
weight, all joyn'd together, not the lea&s;t
parted, but as they lay upon the I&s;le, which
<PB N="122" REF="136">
&s;ix Sheets of Lead were &s;o carried in the Air
by the Wind fifty Yards and a Foot, mea|&s;ured
by a Workman exactly as cou'd be,
from the place of the I&s;le where they lay, to
the place they fell; and they might have been
carried a great way further, had they not hap|pen'd
in their way upon a Tree, &s;truck off an
Arm of it near 17 Yards high; the End of one
Sheet was twi&s;ted round the Body of the Tree,
and the re&s;t all joyn'd together lay at length,
having broke down the Pales fir&s;t where the
Tree &s;tood, and lay upon the Pales on the
Ground, with one End of them, as I &s;aid be|fore,
round the Body of the Tree.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time at <HI>Mar&s;on,</HI> in the County
of <HI>Warwick,</HI> about 4 Miles from this place, a
great Rick of Wheat was blown off from its
Staddles, and &s;et down without one Sheaf re|mov'd,
or di&s;turb'd, or without &s;tanding a|way
20 Yards from the place.</P>
<P>If you have a mind to be farther &s;aisfied in
this Matter, let me hear from you, and I will
endeavour it: But I am in great ha&s;t at this

<P>I Received yours, and in An&s;wer the&s;e are

no ways behind the re&s;t of our Neighbours
in that mighty Storm or Hurricane. As for
our own Pari&s;h, very few Hou&s;es or Outhou|&s;es
e&s;caped. There was in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Fare|ham</HI>
&s;ix Barns blown down, with divers other
Outhou&s;es, and many Trees blown up by the
Roots, and other broken off in the middle; by
the fall of a large Elm, a very large Stone
Window at the We&s;t End of our Church was
broken down; there was but two Stacks of
Chimneys thrown down in all our Pari&s;h that
I know of, and tho&s;e without hurting any Per|&s;on.
There was in a <HI>Coppice</HI> called <HI>Pupal Cop|pice,</HI>
an Oak Tree, of about a Load of Tim|ber,
that was twi&s;ted off with the Wind, and
the Body that was left &s;tanding down to the
very Roots &s;o &s;hivered, that if it were cut in|to
Lengths, it would fall all in pieces. Not|with&s;tanding
&s;o many Trees, and &s;o much Out|Hou&s;ing

one Bea&s;t that was killed or hurt. There was
on the <HI>Down</HI> called <HI>Port&s;down,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of

that it cannot be all repaired till after a|nother

we had but one Ve&s;&s;el abroad at that time,
which was one <HI>John Wat&s;on,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of

<P>I Perceive by an Adverti&s;ement in the <HI>Ga|zette</HI>

&s;ome con&s;iderable Things which happened in
the late Tempe&s;t is intended to be printed,
which de&s;ign I believe will be well approved
of, that the Memory of it may be perpetua|ted.
I will give you an Account of &s;ome of
the ob&s;ervable Damages done in this Pari&s;h:
The Church which was Til'd is &s;o &s;hattered,
that the Body of it is entirely to be ripp'd.
Two Barns, and a Stable have been blown
down; in the latter were 13 Hor&s;es, and
none of them hurt, tho' there was but one to
be &s;een when the Men fir&s;t came. I have
number'd about 20 large Trees blown down,
which &s;tood in the regular Walks in the Park
here. It is &s;aid, that all the Trees blown
down in both the Parks will make above an
hundred Stacks of Wood. A Summer-hou&s;e
<PB N="132" REF="146">
which &s;tood on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Bowling-green
at <HI>Hatfield</HI>-Hou&s;e, was blown again&s;t
the Wall, and broken, and a large part of it
carried over the Wall, beyond a Cartway in|to
the plowed Grounds. A great part of the
South-wall belonging to one of the Gardens
was levelled with the Ground; tho' it was &s;o
&s;trong, that great part of it continues cemen|ted,
tho' it fell upon a Gravel-walk. Several
Things which happened, incline me to think
that there was &s;omething of an <HI>Hurricane.</HI>
Part of the fine painted Gla&s;s-window in my
Lord <HI>Salisbury's</HI> Chapel was broken, tho' it
looked towards the Ea&s;t. The North-&s;ide of
an Hou&s;e was untiled &s;everal Yards &s;quare.
In &s;ome places the Lead has been rai&s;ed up,
and over one Portal quite blown off. In
<HI>Brocket-hall</HI> Park belonging to Sir <HI>John Reade,</HI>
&s;o many Trees are blown down, that lying as
they do, they can &s;carce be numbred, but by
a moderate Computation, they are &s;aid to a|mount
to above a Thou&s;and. The Damages
which this Pari&s;h hath &s;u&s;tained, undoubtedly
amount to many hundred Pounds, &s;ome of
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable I have mentioned to

with the Wind at N. W. about 10-a-Clock it
<PB N="149" REF="163">
veer'd about from W. to S. W. and back to
We&s;t again, and between 11 and 12-a-Clock
it blew in a mo&s;t violent and dreadful manner,
that the Country hereabouts thought the great
day of Judgment was coming.</P>
<P>It continued thus blowing till 5-a-Clock, and
then began to abate a little, but has done a
Prodigious damage to almo&s;t all forts of
People, for either their Hou&s;es are blown down,
or their Corn blown out of their $tack-yards,
(&s;ome Furlongs di&s;tance) from the &s;ame$
that the very Fields look in a manner, as if
they had &s;hak'd the Sheaves of Corn over
them. Several Barns blown down, and the
Corn that was in the &s;ame carried clear a|way.</P>
<P>The Churches here abouts have &s;uffered
very much, the Roofs of &s;everal are torn in
pieces, and blown a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance
off.</P>
<P>The &s;mall Quantity of Fruit-Trees we had
in the Neighbourhood about us are &s;o di$|member'd,
and torn in pieces, that few or none
are left fit for bearing Fruit.</P>
<P>The large Timber Trees, as Elm, Oak,
and the like, are generally blown down, o&s;pe|cially
the large&s;t and highe&s;t Trees &s;uffered
mo&s;t; for few Gentlemen that had T$$$s a|bout
their Hou&s;es have any left; and it is
generally ob&s;erv'd here, that the Trees and
Hou&s;es that &s;tood in Valleys, and mo&s;t out of
the Wind, have &s;uffered mo&s;t. In &s;hort, the
<PB N="150" REF="164">
Damage has been &s;o general, that both Rich
and Poor have &s;uffered much.</P>
<P>In <HI>H$lford,</HI> a &s;mall Haven, not far from
hence, there was a Tin Ship blown from her
Anchors with only one Man, and two Boys on
Board, without Anchor, Cable or Boat, and
was forc'd out of the &s;aid Haven about 12-a|Clock
at Night; the next Morning by 8-a|Clock,
the Ship miracuiou&s;ly Run in between
two Rocks in the <HI>$&s;le of Weight,</HI> where the
Men and Goods were &s;aved, but the Ship lo&s;t:
Such a Run, in &s;o &s;hort a time, is almo&s;t Incre|dible,
it being near 80 Leagues in 8 hours time,
I belive it to be very true, for the Ma&s;ter of the
&s;aid Ship I know very well, and &s;ome that were
concern'd in her Lading, which was Tin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Thus far our Letters.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;IT has been impo&s;&s;ible to give an exact
relation in the matter of publick Damage,
either as to the particulars of what is remar|keable,
or an E&s;timate of the general lo&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Ab&s;tract here given, as near as we
could order it, is &s;o well taken, that we have,
<HI>generally &s;peaking,</HI> &s;omething remarkable from
every quarter of the Kingdom, to the South
of the <HI>Trent.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It has been ob&s;erv'd, that tho' it blew a
great Storm farther Northward, yet nothing
<PB N="151" REF="165">
&s;o furious as this way. At <HI>Hull,</HI> indeed,
as the Relation Expre&s;&s;es, it was violent,
but even that violence was moderate, com|par'd
to the Stupendious fury with which
all the Southern part of the Nation was At|tack'd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When the Reader finds an Account here
from <HI>Milford-haven</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> and from <HI>Hel|ford</HI>
in <HI>Cornwall</HI> We&s;t, from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> and
<HI>Deal</HI> in the Ea&s;t, from <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> in the
South, and <HI>Hull</HI> in the North, I am not to
imagine him &s;o weak as to &s;uppo&s;e all the
va&s;t Interval had not the &s;ame, or propor|tion'd
&s;uffering, when you find one Letter
from a Town, and two from a County, it
is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that was the whole
damage in that County, but, on the contra|ry,
that every Town in the County &s;uffered
the &s;ame thing in proportion; and it would
have been endle&s;s to the Collector, and tire|&s;om
to the Reader, to have Enumerated all
the Individuals of every County; 'twould be
endle&s;s to tell the De&s;olation in the
Parks, Groves, and fine Walks of the Gen|try,
the general havock in the Orchards and
Gardens among the Fruit Trees, e&s;pecially
in the Countries of <HI>Devon, Somer&s;et, Here|ford,
Glouce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> where the ma|king
great quantities of Cyder and Perry,
is the rea&s;on of numerous and large Orch|ards,
among which, for &s;everal Miles toge|ther,
there would be very few Trees left.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="166">
&startq;In <HI>Kent</HI> the Editor of this Book has &s;een
&s;everal great Orchards, the Trees lying flat
on the Ground, and perhaps one Tree &s;tand|ing
in a place by it &s;elf, as a Hou&s;e might
&s;helter it, perhaps none at all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So many Trees were every where blown
cro&s;s the Road, that till the People were
cal$d to &s;aw them off, and remove them, the
ways were not pa&s;&s;able.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Stacks of Corn and Hay were in all places
either blown down, or &s;o torn, that they re|ceiv'd
great damage, and in this Article 'tis
very ob&s;ervable, tho&s;e which were only blown
down receiv'd the lea&s;t Injury; when the main
body of a Stack of Hay &s;tood &s;afe, the top
being loo&s;en'd by the Violence of the Wind,
the Hay was driven up into the Air, and
flew about like Feathers, that it was entirely
lo&s;t, and hung about in the Neighbouring
Trees, and &s;pread on the Ground for a great
di&s;tance and &s;o perfectly &s;eperated, that there
was no gathering it together.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Barly and Oats &s;uffered the &s;ame ca&s;ualty,
only that the weight of the Corn &s;ettled it
&s;ooner to the Ground than the Hay.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to the Stacks of Wheat, the Accounts
are very &s;trange; from many places we have
Letters, and &s;ome &s;o incredible, that we dare
not venture on the Readers faith to tran&s;mit
them, lea&s;t they &s;hould &s;hock their belief in
tho&s;e very &s;trange Relations already &s;et down,
and better Atte&s;ted, as of a great Stack of
<PB N="153" REF="167">
Corn taken from the Hovel on which it &s;tood,
and without Di&s;locating the Sheaves, &s;et up|on
another Hovel, from whence the Wind
had ju&s;t before remoy'd another Stack of
equal Dimen&s;ions; of a Stack of Wheat ta|ken
up with the Wind, and &s;et down whole
16 Rod off, and the like. But as we have
other Relations equally &s;trange, their Truth
con&s;idered, we refer the Reader to them, and
a&s;&s;ure the World we have &s;everal Accounts
of Stacks of Wheat taken clear off from the
Frame or Steddal, and &s;et down whole,
abundance more over-&s;et, and thrown off
from their &s;tandings, and others quite di&s;|pers'd,
and in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troy'd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis true, Corn was exceeding cheap all
the Winter after, but they who bring that as
a rea&s;on to prove there was no great quan|tity
de&s;troy'd, are oblig'd to bear with me
in telling them they are mi&s;taken, for the
true rea&s;on was as follows,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Stacks of Corn in &s;ome Countries,
the We&s;t chiefly, where the People general|ly
lay up their Corn in Stacks, being &s;o
damni&s;y'd as above, and the Barns in all parts
being Univer&s;ally uncovered, and a va&s;t num|ber
of them overturn'd, and blown down,
the Country People were under a nece&s;&s;ity
of Thre&s;hing out their Corn with all po&s;&s;ible
&s;peed, lea&s;t if a Rain had follow'd, as at that
time of Year was not unlikely, it might ha'
been all &s;poil'd.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="168">
&startq;And it was a &s;pecial Providence to tho&s;e
People al&s;o, as well as to us in <HI>London;</HI> that
it did not Rain, at lea&s;t to any quantity, for
near three Weeks after the Storm.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Be&s;ides this, the Country People were obli|ged
to thre&s;h out their Corn for the &s;ake of
the Straw, which they wanted to repair the
Thatch, and covering of their Barns, in order
to &s;ecure the re&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All the&s;e Circum&s;tances forc'd the Corn to
Market in unu&s;ual quantities, and that by
Con&s;equence made it Cheaper than ordina|ry,
and not the exceeding quantity then in
Store.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Seats of the Gentlemen in all places
had an extraordinary &s;hare in the Damage;
their Parks were in many places per&s;ectly
di&s;mantled, the Trees before their Doors
levelled, their Garden Walls blown down, and
I could give a Li&s;t, I believe, of a thou&s;and
Seats in <HI>England,</HI> within the compa&s;s of
our Collected Papers, who had from 5 to
20 Stacks of Chimnies blown down, &s;ome
more, &s;ome le&s;s, according to the &s;everal Di|mentions
of the Hou&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am not obliging the Reader to comply
with the Ca$culations here following, and it
would have took up too much room in this
&s;mall Tract to name particulars; but accord|ing
to the be&s;t e&s;timate I have been able to
make from the general Accounts &s;ent up by
Per&s;ons forward to have this matter recorded,
<PB N="155" REF="169">
the following particulars are rather under
thanover the real Truth.&endq;</P>
<Q>25 Parks in the &s;everal Countries, who
have above 1000 Trees in each
Park, blown down.</Q>
<P>&startq;<HI>New Fore&s;t</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> above 4000, and
&s;ome of prodigious Bigne&s;s; above 450
Parks and Groves, who have from 200 large
Trees to 1000 blown down in them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Above 100 Chuches covered with Lead,
the Lead roll'd up, the Churches uncover'd;
and on &s;ome of them, the Lead in Prodigi|ous
Quantities blown to incredible Di&s;tances
from the Church.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Above 400 Wind-mils over&s;et, and bro|ken
to pieces; or the Sails &s;o blown round,
that the Timbers and Wheels have heat and
&s;et the re&s;t on Fire, and &s;o burnt them down,
as particularly &s;everal were in the I&s;le
of <HI>Ely.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Seven Steeples quite blown down, be|&s;ides
abundance of Pinacles and Battle|ments
from tho&s;e which &s;tood; and the
Churches where it happened mo&s;t of them
Demoli&s;h'd, or terribly Shattered.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Above 800 dwelling Hou&s;es blown down,
in mo&s;t of which the Inhabitants received
&s;ome Brui&s;e or Wounds, and many lo&s;t their
Lives.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We have reckoned, including the City of
<HI>London,</HI> about 123 People kill'd; be&s;ides
&s;uch as we have had no account of; the Num|ber
<PB N="156" REF="170">
of People drowned are not ea&s;ily Gue&s;t;
but by all the Calculations I have made and
&s;een made, we are within compa&s;s, if we
reckon 8000 Men lo&s;t, including what were
lo&s;t on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> what in Ships
blown away, and never heard of, and what
were drowned in the Flood of the <HI>Severn,</HI>
and in the River of <HI>Thames.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What the Lo&s;s, how many poor Families
ruin'd, is not to be E&s;timated, the Fire of
<HI>London</HI> was an exceeding Lo&s;s, and was by
&s;ome reckon'd at four Millions &s;terling;
which, tho' it was a great Lo&s;s, and hap|pened
upon the &s;pot, where va&s;t Quantities of
Goods being expos'd to the fury of the
Flames, were de&s;troy'd in a hurry, and 14000
dwelling Hou&s;es entirely con&s;um'd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yet on the other Hand, that De&s;ola|tion
was con&s;in'd to a &s;mall Space, the
lo&s;s fell on the wealthie&s;t part of the People;
but this lo&s;s is Univer&s;al, and its extent ge|neral,
not a Hou&s;e, nor a Family that had any
thing to lo&s;e, but have lo&s;t &s;omething by this
Storm, the Sea, the Land, the Hou&s;es, the
Churches, the Corn, the Trees, the Rivers,
all have felt the fury of the Winds.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot therefore think I &s;peak too large,
if I &s;ay, I am of the Opinion, that the Da|mage
done by this Tempe&s;t far exceeded the
Fire of <HI>London.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They tell us the Damages done by the
Tide, on the Banks of the <HI>Severn,</HI> amounts
<PB N="157" REF="171">
to above 200000 pounds, 15000 Sheep
drown'd in one Level, Multitudes of Cattle
on all the &s;ides, and the covering the Lands
with Salt Water is a Damage cannot well be
E&s;timated: The High Tide at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> &s;poil'd
or damni&s;y'd 1500 Hog&s;heds of Sugars and
Tobaccoes, be&s;ides great quantities of other
Goods.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the general Ca|lamity,
and the mo&s;t we can do is, to lead
our Reader to &s;upply by his Immagination
what we omit; and to believe, that as the
Head of the particulars is thus collected, an
infinite Variety at the &s;ame time happened in
every place, which cannot be expected to be
found in this Relation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There are &s;ome additional Remarks to be
made as to this Tempe&s;ts, which I cannot
think improper to come in here: As,&endq;</P>
<P>1. &startq;That in &s;ome Parts of <HI>England</HI> it was
join'd with terrible Lightnings and Fla&s;hings
of Fire, and in other Places none at all, as
to Thunder the Noi&s;e the Wind made, was
&s;o Terrible, and &s;o Unu&s;ual, that I will not
&s;ay, People might not mi&s;take it for Thun|der;
but I have not met with any, who
will be po&s;itive that they heard it Thunder.&endq;</P>
<P>2. &startq;Others, as in many Letters we have
received to that purpo&s;e in&s;i&s;t upon it, that
they felt an Earthquake; and this I am
doubtful of for &s;everal Rea&s;ons.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="172">
1&s;t. &startq;We find few People either in City
or Country ventur'd our of their Hou&s;es, or at
lea&s;t till they were forced out, and I can|not
find any Voucher to this opinion of an
Earthquake, from tho&s;e who&s;e Feet &s;tood
upon the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> felt it move, and will
affirm it to be &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>2d, &startq;As to all tho&s;e People who were in
Hou&s;es, I cannot allow them to be competent
Judges, for as no Hou&s;e was &s;o &s;trong as not
to move and &s;hake with the force of the Wind,
&s;o it mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible for them to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
whither that motion came from a|bove
or below: As to tho&s;e in Ships, they will
not pretend to be competent Judges in this
ca&s;e, and I think the People within doors as
improper to decide, for what might not that
motion they felt in their Hou&s;es, from the
Wind do, that an Earthquake could do. We
found it rockt the &s;tronge&s;t Buildings, and in
&s;everal places made the Bells in the Steeples
&s;trike, $loo&s;en'd the Foundations of the
Hou&s;es, and in &s;ome blew them quite down,
but &s;till if it had been an Earthquake, it mu&s;t
have been felt in every hou&s;e, and every
place; and whereas in tho&s;e Streets of <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
where the Hou&s;es &s;tand thick and well
Built, they could not be &s;o &s;haken with the
Wind as in opener places; yet there the other
would have equally been felt, and better
di&s;tingui&s;ht; and this particularly by the
Watch, who &s;tood on the Ground, under
<PB N="159" REF="173">
&s;helter of publick Buildings, as in St. <HI>Paul's</HI>
Church, the Exchange Gates, the Gates of
the City, and &s;uch like; wherefore, as I
am not for handing to Po&s;terity any matter
of Fact upon ill Evidence, &s;o I cannot tran&s;|mit
what has its Foundation only in the
Amazements of the People.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis true, that there was an Earthquake
felt in the <HI>North Ea&s;t parts of the Kingdoms,</HI>
about a Month afterwards, of which &s;eve|ral
Letters here in&s;erted make mention, and
one very particularly from <HI>Hull;</HI> but that
there was any &s;uch thing as an Earthquake
during the Storm, I cannot agree.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Another remarkable thing I have ob&s;erv'd,
and have &s;everal Letters to &s;how of the Wa|ter
which fell in the Storm, being bracki&s;h,
and at <HI>Cranbrook</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> which is at lea&s;t
16 Miles from the Sea, and above 25 from
any Part of the Sea to windward, from
whence the Wind could bring any moi&s;ture,
<HI>for it could not be &s;uppo&s;s'd to fly again&s;t the
Wind;</HI> the Gra&s;s was &s;o &s;alt, the Cattel
would not eat for &s;everal Days, from whence
the ignorant People &s;ugge&s;ted another Mira|cle,
<HI>viz.</HI> that it rain'd &s;alt Water.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>V. Part of a Letter from Mr. Anthony van

on the late Storm.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Delft, <DATE>Jan. 8. 1704.</DATE> N. S.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Affirmed in my Letter of the 3d of <HI>No|vember</HI>
la&s;t pa&s;t, that Water may be &s;o
da&s;h'd and beaten again&s;t the Banks and Dikes
by a &s;trong Wind, and divided into &s;uch
&s;mall Particles, as to be carried far up into
the Land.</P>
<P>Upon the 8th of <HI>December,</HI> 1703. N. S. We
had a dreadful Storm from the South We&s;t,
in&s;omuch, that the Water mingled with &s;mall
parts of Chalk and Stone, was &s;o da&s;ht again&s;t
the Gla&s;s-windows, that many of them were
darkned there with, and the lower Windows
of my Hou&s;e, which are made of very fine
Gla&s;s, and always kept well &s;cower'd, and
were not open'd till 8-a-Clock that Morning,
notwith&s;tanding that they look to the North.
Ea&s;t, and con&s;equently &s;tood from the Wind;
and more over, were guarded from the Rain
by a kind of Shelf or Pent-hou&s;e over them;
were yet &s;o cover'd with the Particles of the
Water which the Whirl-wind ca&s;t again&s;t
them, that in le&s;s than half an hour they were
deprived of mo&s;t of their tran&s;parency, and,
foral much as the&s;e Particles of Water were
not quite exhaled, I concluded that it mu&s;t
<PB N="162" REF="176">
be Sea-water, which the &s;aid Storm had not
only da&s;ht again&s;t our Windows, but &s;pread
al&s;o over the whole Country.</P>
<P>That I might be &s;atisfied herein, I blow'd
two &s;mall Gla&s;&s;es, &s;uch as I thought mo&s;t
proper to make my Ob&s;ervations with, con|cerning
the Particles of Water that adhered to
my Windows.</P>
<P>Pre&s;&s;ing the&s;e Gla&s;&s;es gently again&s;t my
Windows, that were covered with the &s;uppos'd
Particles of Sea-water, my Gla&s;&s;es were tin|ged
with a few of the &s;aid Particles.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gla&s;&s;es, with the Water I had thus
collected on them, I placed at about half a
Foot di&s;tance from the Candle, I view'd them
by my Micro&s;cope, reck'ning, that by the
warmth of the Candle, and my Face together,
the Particles of the &s;aid Water would be put
into &s;uch a motion, that they would exhale
for the mo&s;t part, and the Salts that were in
'em would be expos'd naked to the &s;ight, and
&s;o it happened; for in a little time a great ma|ny
Salt Particles did, as it were, come out of
the Water, having the Figure of our common
Salt, but very &s;mall, becau&s;e the Water was
little, from whence tho&s;e &s;mall Particles pro|ceeded;
and where the Water had lain very
thin upon the Gla&s;s, there were indeed a
great number of Salt Particles, but &s;o exceed|ing
&s;ine, that they almo&s;t e&s;caped the Sight
through a very good Micro&s;cope.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="177">
From whence I concluded, that the&s;e Gla&s;s|windows
could not be brought to their former
Lu&s;tre, but by wa&s;hing them with a great deal
of Water; for if the Air were very clear, and
the Weather dry, the watry Particles would
&s;oon exhale, but the Salts would cleave fa&s;t to
the Gla&s;s, which &s;aid Salts would be again
di&s;&s;olv'd in moi&s;t Weather, and &s;it like a Dew
or Mi&s;t upon the Windows.</P>
<P>And accordingly my People found it when
they came to wa&s;h the afore-mentioned lower
Windows of my Hou&s;e; but as to the upper
Windows, where the Rain had beat again&s;t
them, there was little or no Salt to be found
&s;ticking upon that Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Now, if we con&s;ider, what a quantity of
Sea-water is &s;pread all over the Country by
&s;uch a terrible Storm, and con&s;equently, how
greatly impregnated the Air is with the &s;ame;
we ought not to wonder, that &s;uch a quanti|ty
of Water, being moved with &s;o great a
force, &s;hould do &s;o much mi&s;chief to Chim|neys,
tops of Hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not to mention the
Damages at Sea.</P>
<P>During the &s;aid Storm, and about 8-a-Clock
in the Morning, I ca&s;t my Eye upon my Ba|rometer,
and ob&s;erv'd, that I had never &s;een
the Quick-&s;ilver &s;o low; but half an hour af|ter
the Quick-&s;ilver began to ri&s;e, tho' the
Storm was not at all abated, at lea&s;t to any
appearance; from whence I concluded, and
&s;aid it to tho&s;e that were about me, that the
<PB N="164" REF="178">
Storm would not la&s;t long; and &s;o it hap|pened.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome that affirm, that the &s;cat|tering
of this Salt-water by the Storm will do
a great deal of harm to the Fruits of the
Earth; but for my part I am of a quite diffe|rent
Opinion, for I believe that a little Salt
&s;pread over the &s;urface of the Earth, e&s;pecial|ly
where it is heavy Clay-ground, does ren|der
it exceeding Fruitful; and &s;o it would be,
if the Sand out of the Sea were made u&s;e of to
the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e Letters are too well, and too judi|ciou&s;ly
Written to need any comment of
mine; 'tis plain, the watry Particles taken up
from the Sprye of the Sea into the Air, might
by the impetuo&s;ity of the Winds be carried
a great way, and if it had been much far|ther,
it would have been no Miracle in my
account; and this is the rea&s;on, why I have
not related the&s;e Things, among the extraor|dinary
Articles of the Storm.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That the Air was full of Meoters, and
fiery Vapours, and that the extraordinary
Motion occa&s;ion'd the firing more of them
than u&s;ual, a &s;mall &s;tock of Philo&s;ophy will
make very rational; and of the&s;e we have
various Accounts, more in &s;ome places tha$
in others, and I am apt to believe the&s;e were
<PB N="165" REF="179">
the Lighntings we have been told of; for I am
of Opinion, that there was really no Light|ning,
&s;uch as we call &s;o in the common Ac|ceptation
of it; for the Clouds that flew with
&s;o much Violence through the Air, were not,
as to my Ob&s;ervation, &s;uch as u&s;ually are
fraighted with Thunder and Lightning, the
Hurries nature was then in, do not con&s;i&s;t
with the Sy&s;tem of Thunder, which is Air
pent in between the Clouds; and as for the
Clouds that were &s;een here flying in the Air,
they were by the fury of the Winds &s;o &s;epera|ted,
and in &s;uch &s;mall Bodies, that there was
on room for a Collection &s;uitable, and nece&s;&s;a|ry
to the Ca&s;e we &s;peak of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e Cautions I thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et
down here, for the &s;atisfaction of the Curi|ous;
and as they are only my Opinions, I
&s;ubmit them to the judgment of the Rea|der.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Of the Damages on the Water.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;AS this might con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal Parts, I
was inclin'd to have divided it into
Sections or Chapters, relating particularly to
the publick Lo&s;s, and the private; to the
Merchant, or the Navy, to Floods by the
Tides, to the River Damage, and that
<PB N="166" REF="180">
of the Sea; but for brevity, I &s;hall confine
it to the following particulars.&endq;</P>
<Q><L><HI>&startq;Fir&s;t,</HI> The Damage to Trade.</L>
<L><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Damage to the Royal Navy.</L>
<L><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Damage by High Tides.</L>
<L><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Of the Damage to Trade.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>&startq;I might call it a Damage to Trade, that
this Sea&s;on was both for &s;ome time before
and after the Tempe&s;t, &s;o exceeding, and &s;o
continually Stormy, that the Seas were
in a manner Unnavigable and Negoce,
at a kind of a general Stop, and when the
Storm was over, and the VVeather began
to be tolerable; almo&s;t all the Shipping in
<HI>England</HI> was more or le&s;s out of Repair, for
there was very little Shipping in the Nation,
but what had receiv'd &s;ome Damage or
other.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is impo&s;&s;ible, but a Nation &s;o full of
Shipping as this, mu&s;t be exceeding Suffer|ers
in &s;uch a general Di&s;a&s;ter, and who ever
con&s;iders the Violence of this Storm by its
other dreadful Effects will rather wonder,
and be thankful that we receiv'd no farther
Damage, than we &s;hall be able to give an
Account of by Sea.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have already ob&s;erv'd what Fleets were
in the &s;everal Ports of this Nation, and from
whence they came: As to Ships lo&s;t of
<PB N="167" REF="181">
whom we have no other Account than that
they were never heard of. I am not able to
give any Perticulars, other than that a|bout
three and forty Sail of all Sorts are
reckon'd to have peri&s;hed in that manner. I
mean of &s;uch Ships as were at Sea, when
the Storm began, and had no Shelter or Port to
make for their Safety: Of the&s;e, &s;ome were
of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Fleet, of whom we had an Ac|count
of 20 Sail lo&s;t the Week before the
great Storm, but mo&s;t of them reach'd the
Ports of <HI>Newca&s;tle, Humber</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI>
and &s;ome of the Men &s;uffered in the general
Di&s;tre&s;s afterwards.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But to proceed to the mo&s;t general Di&s;a|&s;ters,
by the &s;ame Method, as in the former
Articles of Damages by Land. Several Per|&s;ons
having given them&s;elves the Trouble to
further this De&s;ign with Authentick Parti|culars
from the re&s;pective Ports. I con|ceive
we cannot give the World a clearer

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>REading the Adverti&s;ement in the <HI>Gazette,</HI>
of your intending to Print the many
&s;ad Accidents in the late dreadful Storm, in|duced
me to let you know what this place felt,
tho a very good Harbour. Her Maje&s;ty's
Ships the <HI>Cumberland, Coventry, Loo, Ha&s;tings</HI>
and <HI>Hec$or,</HI> being under my Command, with the
<HI>Rye</HI> a Cruizer on this Station, and under our
Convoy about 130 Merchant Ships bound a|bout
Land; the 26th of <HI>November</HI> at one in
the Afternoon the Wind came at S. by E. a
hard Gale, between which and N. W. by W. it
came to a dreadful Storm, at three the next
Morning was the Violente&s;t of the Weather,
when the <HI>Cumberland</HI> broak her Sheet Anchor,
the Ship driving near <HI>this,</HI> and the <HI>Rye,</HI> both
narrowly e&s;cap'd carrying away; &s;he drove
very near the Rocks, having but one Anchor
left, but in a little time they &s;lung a Gun,
with the broken Anchor fa&s;t to it, which they
let go, and wonderfully pre&s;erv'd the Ship
from the Shoar. Guns firing from one Ship or
other all the Night for help, tho' 'twas impo&s;&s;i|ble
to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, the Sea was &s;o high, and
the Darkne&s;s of the Night &s;uch, that we could
not &s;ee where any one was, but by the Fla&s;hes
of the Guns; when day light appear'd, it was a
<PB N="169" REF="183">
di&s;mal &s;ight to behold the Ships driving up and
down one foul of another, without Ma&s;ts,
&s;ome &s;unk, and others upon the Rocks, the
Wind blowing &s;o hard, with Thunder, Light|ning
and Rain, that on the Deck a Man could
not &s;tand without holding. Some drove from
<HI>Dale,</HI> where they were &s;helter'd under the
Land, and &s;plit in pieces, the Men all drown|ed;
two others drove out of a Creek, one on
the Shoar &s;o high up was &s;aved, the other on
the Rocks in another Creek, and Bulg'd; an
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Ship that lay with a Rock thro' her, was
lifted by the Sea clear away to the other &s;ide
of the Creek on a &s;afe place; one Ship forc'd
10 Miles up the River before &s;he could be
&s;top'd, and &s;everal &s;trangely blown into holes,
and on Banks; a Ketch of <HI>Pembroke</HI> was drove
on the Rocks, the two Men and a Boy in her
had no Boat to &s;ave their Lives; but
in this great di&s;tre&s;s a Boat which broke from
another Ship drove by them, without any in
her, the two Men leap into her, and were &s;av'd,
but the Boy drown'd; a Prize at <HI>Pembroke</HI>
was lifted on the Bridge, whereon is a Mill,
which the Water blew up, but the Ve&s;&s;el got
off again; another Ve&s;&s;el carried almo&s;t into
the Gateway which leads to the Bridge, and
is a Road, the Tide flowing &s;everal Foot above
its common Cour&s;e. The Storm continu'd till
the 27th about 3 in the Afternoon; that by
Computation nigh 30 Merchant Ships and
Ve&s;&s;els without Ma&s;ts are lo&s;t, and what Men are
<PB N="170" REF="184">
lo&s;t is not known; 3 Ships are mi&s;&s;ing, that we
&s;uppo&s;e Men and all lo&s;t. None of her Maje&s;ty's
Ships came to any harm; but the <HI>Cumberland</HI>
breaking her Anchor in a Storm which hap|pen'd
the 18th at Night, lo&s;t another, which
renders her uncacapable of proceeding with us

<P>UPon the Evening of <HI>Friday, Nov.</HI> 26.
1703. the Wind was very high; but
about midnight it broke out with a more than
wonted Violence, and &s;o continued till near
break of day. It ended a N. W. Wind, tho'
about 3 in the Morning it was at S. W. The
loude&s;t cracks I ob&s;erved of it, were &s;omewhat
before 4 of the Clock; we had here the com|mon
Calamity of Hou&s;es &s;hatter'd and Trees
thrown down.</P>
<P>But the Wind throwing the Tyde very
&s;trongly into the <HI>Severn,</HI> and &s;o into the <HI>Wye,</HI>
on which <HI>Chep&s;tow</HI> is &s;cituated. And the Fre&s;h
in <HI>Wye</HI> meeting with a Rampant Tyde, over|flowed
<PB N="171" REF="185">
the lower part of our Town. It came
into &s;everal Hou&s;es about 4 foot high, rather
more; the greate&s;t damage &s;u&s;tained in Hou&s;es,
was by the makers of Salt, perhaps their lo&s;s
might amount to near 200 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>But the Bridge was a &s;trange &s;ight; it &s;tands
partly in <HI>Monmouth&s;hire,</HI> and partly in <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI>
and is built mo&s;tly of Wood, with
a Stone Peer in the mid&s;t, the Center of which
divides the two Counties; there are al&s;o Stone
Platforms in the bottom of the River to bear
the Wood-work. I doubt not but tho&s;e Stone
Platforms were covered then by the great Fre&s;h
that came down the River. But over the&s;e
there are Wooden Standards fram'd into Peers
42 Foot high; be&s;ides Ground&s;ils, Cap-heads,
Sleepers, Planks, and (on each &s;ide of the
Bridge) Rails which may make about 6 foot
more, the Tyde came over them all: The
length of the Wooden part of the Bridge in
<HI>Monmouth&s;hire</HI> is 60 yards exactly, and there|about
in <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire;</HI> the <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> &s;ide
&s;uffered but little, but in <HI>Monmouth&s;hire</HI> &s;ide
the Planks were mo&s;t of them carried away,
the Sleepers (about a Tun by mea&s;ure each)
were many of them carried away, and &s;eve|ral
removed, and 'tis not doubted but the
great Wooden Peers would have gone too;
but it was &s;o, that the outward Sleepers on
each &s;ide the Bridge were Pinn'd or Bolted to
the Cap heads, and &s;o kept them in their
places.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="186">
All the level Land on the South part of <HI>Mon|mouth&s;hire,</HI>
called the <HI>Moors,</HI> was overflow'd;
it is a tract of Land about 20 miles long,
all Level, &s;ave 2 little points of High-land, or
3; the Breadth of it is not all of one &s;ize, the
broade&s;t part is about 2 miles and 1/2. This
Tyde came 5 Tydes before the top of the
Spring, according to the u&s;ual run, which &s;ur|prized
the People very much. Many of their
Cattle got to &s;hore, and &s;ome dy'd after they
were landed. It is thought by a <HI>Moderate
Computation,</HI> they might lo&s;e in Hay and Cat|tle
between 3 and 4000 <HI>l.</HI> I cannot hear of any
Per&s;on drowned, &s;ave only one Servant Man, that
ventur'd in que&s;t of his Ma&s;ter's Cattle. The
People were carried off, &s;ome by Boats, &s;ome
otherways, the days following; the la&s;t that
came off (that I can hear of) were on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> E|vening,
to be &s;ure they were unea&s;y and a&s;to|ni&s;hed
in that Interval. There are various reports
about the height of this Tyde in the <HI>Moors,</HI>
comparing it with that in <HI>Jan.</HI> 1606. But
the account that &s;eems likelie&s;t to me, is, that
the former Tyde ran &s;omewhat higher than this.
'Tis thought mo&s;t of their Land will be worth
but little the&s;e 2 or 3 years, and 'tis known,
that the repairing the Sea Walls will be very
chargeable.</P>
<P><HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> too, that borders upon <HI>Se|verne</HI>
hath &s;uffered deeply on the Forre&s;t
of <HI>Deane</HI> &s;ide, but nothing in compari&s;on of
the other &s;hore, from about <HI>Harlingham</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="187">
down to the mouth of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> River <HI>Avon,</HI>
particularly from <HI>Au&s;t Cliffe</HI> to the Rivers
Mouth (about 8 miles) all that Flat, called
the <HI>Mar&s;h</HI> was drowned. They lo&s;t many
Sheep and Cattle. About 70 Seamen were
drown'd out of the <HI>Canterbury</HI> Store&s;hip, and
other Ships that were Stranded or Wreck'd.
The <HI>Arundel</HI> Man of War, <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Can|terbury</HI>
Store&s;hips, a <HI>French</HI> Prize, and a <HI>Dane,</HI>
were driven a&s;hore and damnified; but the <HI>A|rundel</HI>
and the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Ship are got off, the re&s;t
remain on Ground. The <HI>Richard and John</HI> of
about 500 Tun, newly come into <HI>King-road</HI>
from <HI>Virginia,</HI> was Staved. The <HI>Shoram</HI> rode
it out in <HI>King-road;</HI> but I &s;uppo&s;e you may
have a perfecter account of the&s;e things from
<HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> But one thing yet is to be remem|bred,
one <HI>Nelms</HI> of that Country, as I hear
his Name, was carried away with his Wife
and 4 Children, and Hou&s;e and all, and were
all lo&s;t, &s;ave only one Girl, who caught hold
of a Bough, and was pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>There was another unfortunate Accident
yet in the&s;e parts, one Mr. <HI>Churchman,</HI> that
keeps the Inns at <HI>Bete&s;ley,</HI> a pa&s;$age over the
<HI>Severn,</HI> and had a &s;hare in the pa&s;&s;ing Boars,
&s;eeing a &s;ingle Man to&s;&s;ed in a Wood-bu&s;s off
in the River, prevailed with &s;ome belonging
to the Cu&s;toms, to carry him&s;elf and one of
his Sons, and 12 Servants aboard the Boat,
which they did, and the Officers de&s;ired Mr.
<HI>Churchman</HI> to take out the Man, and come
<PB N="174" REF="188">
a&s;hore with them in their Pinnace. But he,
willing to &s;ave the Boat as well as the Man,
tarried aboard, and &s;ometime after hoi&s;ting
Sail, the Boat over&s;et, and they were all
drowned, <HI>viz.</HI> the Man in the Boat, Mr.

Tempe&s;t, in order to make a Collection there|of.
I have prefum'd to pre&s;ent you with the
following particulars concerning <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and
the parts near Adjacent, being an Eye-witne&s;s
of the &s;ame, or the Majority of it. On <HI>Sa|turday</HI>
the 27th of <HI>Novemb.</HI> la&s;t, between the
hours of one and two in the Morning, aro&s;e
a mo&s;t prodigious Storm of Wind, which con|tinued
with very little intermi&s;&s;ion for the &s;pace
of 6 hours, in which time it very much &s;hat|tered
the Buildings, both publick and private,
by uncovering the Hou&s;es, throwing down
the Chimneys, breaking the Gla&s;s Windows,
overthrowing the Pinnacles and Battle|ments
of the Churches, and blowing off the
<PB N="176" REF="190">
Leads: The Churches in particular felt the
fury of the Storm. St. <HI>Stephen's</HI> Tower had
three Pinnacles blown off, which beat down
the greate&s;t part of the Church. The Cathe|dral
is likewi&s;e very much defac'd, two of its
Windows, and &s;everal Battlements being blown
away; and, indeed, mo&s;t Churches in the City
felt its force more or le&s;s; it al&s;o blew down
abundance of great Trees in the Mar&s;h, <HI>Col|lege-Green,</HI>
St. <HI>James</HI>'s Church-yard, and other
places in the City. And in the Country it
blew down and &s;cattered abundance of Hay
and Corn Mows, be&s;ides almo&s;t Levelling ma|ny
Orchards and Groves of &s;tout Trees. But
the greate&s;t damage done to the City was, the
violent over-flowing of the Tide, occa&s;ion'd
by the force of the Wind, which flowed an
extraordinary height, and did abundance of
damage to the Merchants Cellers. It broke
in with great fury over the Mar&s;h Country,
forcing down the Banks or Sea Walls, drown|ing
abundance of Sheep, and other Cattle,
wa&s;hing &s;ome hou&s;es clear away, and break|ing
down part of others, in which many Per|&s;ons
lo&s;t their Lives. It likewi&s;e drove mo&s;t
of the Ships in <HI>Kingroad</HI> a con&s;iderable way
upon the Land, &s;ome being much &s;hatter'd,
and one large Ve&s;&s;el broke all in pieces, and
near all the Men lo&s;t, be&s;ides &s;everal lo&s;t out
of other Ve&s;&s;els. To conclude, the Damage
&s;u&s;tein'd by this City alone in Merchandi&s;e,
Hou&s;es, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> is Computed to an Hundred
<PB N="177" REF="191">
Thou&s;and Pounds, be&s;ides the great Lo&s;s in
the Country, of Cattel, Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which has
utterly ruined many Farmers, who&s;e &s;ub&s;tance
con&s;i&s;ted in their Stock afore&s;aid. So having

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Pari&s;h of <HI>Hunt&s;pill</HI> hath receiv'd
great Damage by the late Inundation
of the Salt Water, particularly the We&s;t part
thereof &s;uffered mo&s;t: For on the 27th Day
of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, about four of the Clock in
the Morning, a mighty Southwe&s;t Wind blew
&s;o &s;trong, as (in a little time) &s;trangely
tore our Sea Walls; in&s;omuch, that a con&s;ide|rable
part of the &s;aid Walls were laid &s;mooth,
after which the Sea coming in with great
Violence, drove in five Ve&s;&s;els belonging to
<HI>Bridgewater Key</HI> out of the Channel, upon a
<PB N="178" REF="192">
Whar$ in our Pari&s;h, which lay &s;ome di&s;tance
off from the Channel, and there they were all
grounded; it is &s;aid, that the Seamen there fa|thom'd
the depth, and found it about nine Foot,
which is taken notice to be four Foot above
our Walls when &s;tanding; the Salt Water &s;oon
overflow'd all the We&s;t end of the Pari&s;h, for|cing
many of the Inhabitants from their Dwel|lings,
and to &s;hift for their Lives: The Wa|ter
threw down &s;everal Hou&s;es, and in one
an antient Woman was drown'd, being about
four&s;core Years old: Some Families &s;helter'd
them&s;elves in the Church, and there &s;taid till
the Waters were abated: Three Window
Leaves of the Tower were blown down, and
the Ruff-ca&s;t &s;cal'd off in many places: Much
of the Lead of the Church was damnify'd;
the Windows of the Church and Chancel
much broken, and the Chancel a great part
of it untiled: The Par&s;onage Hou&s;e, Barn
and Walls received great Damage; as al&s;o,
did &s;ome of the Neighbours in their Hou&s;es:
At the We&s;t end of the Par&s;onage Hou&s;e &s;tood
a very large Elm, which was four Yards a
quarter and half a quarter in the Circumfer|ence,
it was broken off near the Ground by
the Wind, without forcing any one of the
Moars above the Surface, but remain'd as
they were before: The Inhabitants (many of
them) have receiv'd great Lo&s;&s;es in their
Sheep, and their other Cattle; in their Corn
and Hay there is great &s;poil made. This is

<HEAD>From Minehead in Somer&s;et&s;hire, and Swan|zy

be depended upon.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours, and in an&s;wer to it the&s;e
are to acquaint you, that all the Ships in
our Harbour except two (which were 23 or
24 in Number, be&s;ides Fi&s;hing Boats) were,
through the Violence of the Storm, and the
mooring Po&s;ts giving way, drove from their
Anchors, one of them was &s;tav'd to pieces, nine
drove A&s;hoar; but 'tis hoped will be all got off
again, though &s;ome of them are very much
damnified: Several of the Fi&s;hing Boats like|wife,
with their Nets, and other Nece&s;&s;aries
were de&s;troy'd. Three Seamen were drown|ed
in the Storm, and one Man was &s;queez'd
to Death la&s;t <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> by one of the Ships
that was for$'d A&s;hoa$, &s;uddenly com|ing
<PB N="180" REF="194">
upon him, as they were digging round
her, endeavouring to get her off.</P>
<P>Our Peer al&s;o was &s;omewhat damaged, and
'tis thought, if the Storm had continued till
another Tide, it would have been quite wa&s;h|ed
away, even level to the Ground; which
it &s;o, would infallibly have ruined our Har|bour:
Our Church likewi&s;e was almo&s;t all
untiled, the neighbouring Churches al&s;o re|ceived
much Damage: The Hou&s;es of our
Town, and all the Country round about,
were mo&s;t of them damaged; &s;ome (as I am
credibly informed) blown down, and &s;everal
in a great Mea&s;ure uncovered: Trees al&s;o of
a very great Bigne&s;s were broken off in the
middle, and va&s;t Numbers blown down; one
Gentleman, as he told me him&s;elf, having 2500
Trees blown down: I wi&s;h you good Succe&s;s
in the&s;e your Undertakings, and I pray God
that this late great Calamity which was &s;ent
upon us as a puni&s;hment for our Sins, may
be a warning to the whole Nation in general,
and engage every one of us to a hearty and
&s;incere Repentance; otherwi&s;e, I'm afraid we
mu&s;t expect greater Evils than this was to
fall upon us.</P>

<P>I Receiv'd yours and accordingly have made
an enquiry in our Neighbourhood what
damage might be done in the late Storm, thro
Mercy we e&s;cap'd indifferently, but you will
find underwritten as much as I can learn to
be certainly true.</P>
<P>The Storm began here about 12 at Night,
but the mo&s;t violent part of it was about 4
the next Morning, about which time the
greate&s;t part of the Hou&s;es in the Town
were uncovered more or le&s;s, and one Hou&s;e
clearly blown down; the damage &s;u&s;tain'd to
the Hou&s;es is mode&s;tly computed at 200 <HI>l.</HI>
the South I&s;$e of the Church was wholly un|covered,
and con&s;iderable damage done to the
other I&s;les, and 4 large Stones weighing about
One Hundred and Fifty or Two Hundred
Pound each, was blown down from the end of
the Church, three of the four Iron Spears, that
&s;tood with Vanes on the corners of the Tower,
were broke &s;hort off in the middle, and the
Vanes not to be found, and the Tail of the
Weather Cock, which &s;tood in the middle of
the Tower was blown off, and found in a
Court near 400 yards di&s;tant from the Tower.
In <HI>Cline</HI> Wood belonging to the Duke of
<HI>Beaufort</HI> near this Town, there is about 100
large Trees blown down; as al&s;o in a Wood
<PB N="182" REF="196">
on our River belonging to Mr. <HI>Thomas Man&s;ell</HI>
of <HI>Brittonferry</HI> about 80 large Oakes. The
Tydes did not much damage, but two
Ships were blown off our Bar, and by Provi|dence
one came aground on the Salt Hou&s;e
point near our Harbour, el&s;e the Ship and Men
had peri&s;hed; the other came on &s;hore, but
was &s;aved. I hear further, that there are &s;everal
Stacks of Corn over-turn'd by the violence of
the Wind, in the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Roy&s;ily</HI> and <HI>Lar|genny</HI>
in <HI>Gower;</HI> mo&s;t of the Thatcht Hou&s;es

that there was found on the Hedges and

<P>YOu de&s;ire to know what effect the late
dreadful Storm of Wind had upon this
Town; in an&s;wer to your de&s;ire, take the fol|lowing
Account. This Town con&s;i&s;ts of at lea&s;t
600 Hou&s;es, be&s;ides two great Churches, &s;ome
Publick Buildings, and many Shops &s;tanding
upon the Beach near the Sea, and yet by the

upon the Sea &s;hore, but God be thanked
the Sea did us no damage; and the Tydes
were not &s;o great as we have &s;een upon far
le&s;s Storms. The Wind was exceeding Boi&s;te|rous,
which might drive the Froth and Sea
moi&s;ture &s;ix or &s;even miles up the Country,
for at that di&s;tances from the Sea, the Leaves
of the Trees and Bu&s;hes, were as Salt as if

they had been dipped in the Sea, which can be
imputed to nothing el&s;e, but the Violent

<P>YOurs I have receiv'd, in which you de|&s;ire
me to give you an Account of what
remarkable Damage the late violent Storm
hath done at this place; in an&s;wer, We had
mo&s;t of the Ships in our River, and tho&s;e
that laid off from our Keys blown A&s;hoar, &s;ome
partly torn to Wrecks, and three or four blown
&s;o far on Shoar with the Violence of the
Wind, that the Owners have been at the
Charges of unlading them, and dig large
Channels for the Spring Tides to float them
<PB N="193" REF="207">
off, and with much a do have got them off, it
being on a &s;oft Sand or Mud, had but little
Damage; we had, God be prais'd no body
drowned, tho' &s;ome narrowly E&s;cape't: As to
our Town it being mo&s;t part old Building,
we have &s;uffer'd much, few or no Hou&s;es have
e&s;cape't: Several Stacks of Chimneys blown
down, other Hou&s;es mo&s;t part untiled: Seve|ral
People bruis'd, but none kill'd: Abundance
of Trees round about us, e&s;pecially in the
New Fore&s;t blown down; others with their
Limbs of a great bigne&s;s torn; it being what
we had mo&s;t Material. I re&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe&s;e Lines I hope in God will find you
in good Health, we are all left here in
a di&s;mal Condition, expecting every moment
to be all drowned: For here is a great Storm,
and is very likely to continue; we have here
the Rear Admiral of the Blew in the Ship,
call'd the <HI>Mary,</HI> a third Rate, the very next
Ship to ours, &s;unk, with Admiral <HI>Beau|mont,</HI>
and above 500 Men drowned: The
Ship call'd the <HI>Northumberland,</HI> a third Rate,
about 500 Men all &s;unk and drowned: The
Ship call'd the <HI>Sterling Ca&s;tle,</HI> a third Rate,
all &s;unk and drowned above 500 Souls: And
the Ship call'd the <HI>Re&s;toration,</HI> a third Rate,
all &s;unk and drowned: The&s;e Ships were all
clo&s;e by us which I &s;aw; the&s;e Ships fired
their Guns all Night and Day long, poor
Souls, for help, but the Storm being &s;o fierce
and raging, could have none to &s;ave them:
The Ship call'd the <HI>Shrewsberry</HI> that we are in,
broke two Anchors, and did run mighty
fierce backwards, within 60 or 80 Yards of
the Sands, and as God Almighty would have
it, we flung our &s;heet Anchor down, which is
the bigge&s;t, and &s;o &s;topt: Here we all pray'd
to God to forgive us our Sins, and to &s;ave us,
or el&s;e to receive us into his Heavenly King|dom.
If our &s;heet Anchor had given way, we
had been all drown'd: But I humbly thank
<PB N="195" REF="209">
God, it was his gracious Mercy that &s;aved
us. There's one Captain <HI>Fanel</HI>'s Ship, three
Ho&s;pital Ships, all &s;plit, &s;ome &s;unk, and mo&s;t
of the Men drown'd.</P>
<P>There are above 40 Merchant Ships ca&s;t
away and &s;unk: To &s;ee Admiral <HI>Beaumont,</HI>
that was next us, and all the re&s;t of his Men,
how they climed up the main Ma&s;t, hundreds
at a time crying out for help, and thinking
to &s;ave their Lives, and in the twinkling of
an Eye were drown'd: I can give you no
Account, but of the&s;e four Men of War afore|&s;aid,
which I &s;aw with my own Eyes, and
tho&s;e Ho&s;pital Ships, at pre&s;ent, by rea&s;on the
Storm hath drove us far di&s;tant from one ano|ther:
Captain <HI>Crow,</HI> of our Ship, believes we
have lo&s;t &s;everal more Ships of War, by rea|&s;on
we &s;ee &s;o few; we lye here in great dan|ger,
and waiting for a North Ea&s;terly Wind to
bring us to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and it is our Prayers
to God for it; for we know not how &s;oon this
Storm may ari&s;e, and cut us all off, for it is
a di&s;mal Place to Anchor in. I have not had
my Cloaths off, nor a wink of Sleep the&s;e
$our Nights, and have got my Death with
$old almo&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Under&s;tand you are a Per&s;on concerned in
making up a Collection of &s;ome remarka|ble
accidents that happened by the Violence
of the late dreadful Storm. I here pre&s;ent
you with one of the like. I pre&s;ume you ne|ver
heard before, nor hope may never hear
again of a Ship that was blown from her An|chors
out of <HI>Helford Haven</HI> to the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI>
in le&s;s than eight hours, <HI>viz.</HI> The Ship lay
in <HI>Helford Haven</HI> about two Leagues and a
half We&s;tward of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> being laden with
Tin, which was taken on Board from <HI>Guague</HI>
Wharf, about five or &s;ix miles up <HI>Helford</HI>
River, the Commanders name was <HI>Anthony
Jenkins,</HI> who lives at <HI>Falmouth.</HI> About eight $word$
Clock in the Evening before the Storm begun
the &s;aid Commander and Mate came on Board
<PB N="197" REF="211">
and ordered the Crew that he left on Board,
which was but one Man and 2 Boys; that if
the Wind &s;hould chance to blow hard (which
he had &s;ome apprehen&s;ion of) to carry out the
&s;mall Bower Anchor, and moor the Ship by
2 Anchors, and gave them &s;ome other orders,
and his Mate and he went a&s;hoar, and left
the Crew afore&s;aid on Board; about nine a
Clock the VVind began to blow, then they
carried out the &s;mall Bower (as directed) it
continued blowing harder and harder at We&s;t
North We&s;t, at la&s;t the Ship began to drive,
then they were forced to let go the be&s;t Bow|er
Anchor which brought the Ship up. The
Storm increa&s;ing more, they let go the Kedge
Anchor, which was all they had to let go,
&s;o that the Ship rid with four Anchors a head:
Between eleven and twelve a Clock the Wind
came about VVe&s;t and by South in a mo&s;t
Terrible and Violent manner, that notwith|&s;tanding
a very high Hill ju&s;t to VVindward
of the Ship, and four Anchors ahead, &s;he
was drove from all her Anchors; and about
twelve a Clock drove out of the Harbour with|out
Anchor or Cable, nor &s;o much as a Boat
left in ca&s;e they could put into any Harbour.
In dreadful condition the Ship drove out clear
of the Rocks to Sea, where the Man with
the two Boys con&s;ulted what to do, at la&s;t
re&s;olved to keep her far enough to Sea, for
fear of <HI>Deadman</HI>'s <HI>Head,</HI> being a point of Land
<PB N="198" REF="212">
between <HI>Falmonth</HI> and <HI>Plimouth,</HI> the latter of
which places they de&s;igned to run her in, if
po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ave their Lives; the next morn|ing
in this frighted condition they &s;teer'd her
clear of the Land (to the be&s;t of their skill)
&s;ometimes almo&s;t under VVater, and &s;ome|times
a top, with only the bonet of her Fore|&s;ail
out, and the Fore yard almo&s;t lower'd to
the Deck; but in&s;tead of getting into <HI>Plymouth</HI>
next day as intended, they were far enough
off that Port, for the next morning they &s;aw
Land, which proved to be <HI>Peverel</HI> Point, a lit|tle
to the We&s;tward of the <HI>I&s;le of Wight;</HI> &s;o
that they were in a wor&s;e Con&s;ternation then
before, for over-running their de&s;igned Port by
&s;even a Clock, they found them&s;elves off the
<HI>I&s;le of Wight;</HI> where they con&s;ulted again what
to do to &s;ave their Lives, one of the Boys was
for running her into the <HI>Downs,</HI> but that was
objected again&s;t, by rea&s;on they had no An|chors
nor Boat, and the Storm blowing off
&s;hore in the <HI>Downs,</HI> they &s;hould be blown on
the unfortunate <HI>Goodwin Sands</HI> and lo&s;t. Now
comes the la&s;t con&s;ultation for their lives,
there was one of the Boys &s;aid he had been in
a certain Creek in the <HI>I&s;le of Wight,</HI> were be|tween
the Rocks he believed there was room
enough to run the Ship in and &s;ave their Lives
and de&s;ired to have the Helm from the Man,
and he would venture to &s;teer the Ship into
the &s;aid place, which he according did, where
<PB N="199" REF="213">
there was only ju&s;t room between Rock and
Rock for the Ship to come in, where &s;he gave
one blow or two again&s;t the Rocks, and &s;unk
immediately, but the Man and two Boys
jumpt a&s;hore, and all the Lading being Tin
was &s;aved, (and for their Conduct and Risk
they run) they were all very well gratified,
and the Merchants well &s;atisfied.</P>

<DIV2>
<P>&startq;And here I cannot omit that great Notice
has been taken of the Towns-people of <HI>Deal</HI>
who are blam'd, and I doubt not with too
much Rea&s;on for their great Barbarity in neg|lecting
to &s;ave the Lives of abundance of
poor Wretches; who having hung upon the
Ma&s;ts and Rigging of the Ships, or floated
upon the broken Pieces of Wrecks, had got|ten
a Shore upon the <HI>Goodwin Sands</HI> when the
Tide was out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was, without doubt, a &s;ad Spectale to
behold the poor Seamen walking too and fro
upon the Sands, to view their Po&s;tures, and
the Signals they made for help, which, by
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Gla&s;&s;es was ea&s;ily &s;een from
the Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="214">
&startq;Here they had a few Hours Reprieve,
but had neither pre&s;ent Refre&s;hment, nor a|ny
hopes of Life, for they were &s;ure to be
all wa&s;h'd into another World at the Reflux
of the Tide. Some Boats are &s;aid to come
very near them in que&s;t of Booty, and in
&s;earch of Plunder, and to carry off what they
could get, but no Body concern'd them&s;elves
for the Lives of the&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And yet I cannot but incert what I have
receiv'd from very good Hands in behalf of
one Per&s;on in that Town, who&s;e Humanity
de&s;erves this remembrance, and I am glad
of the Opportunity of doing &s;ome Ju&s;tice in
this Ca&s;e to a Man of &s;o much Charity in a
Town of &s;o little.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>Thomas Powell,</HI> of <HI>Deal,</HI> a Slop-Sel|ler
by Trade, and at that time Mayor of
the Town. The Character of his Per&s;on I
need not dwell upon here, other than the
en&s;uing Accounts will de&s;cribe, for when I
have &s;aid he is a Man of Charity and Cou|rage,
there is little I need to add to it, to
move the Reader to value both his Per&s;on,
and his Memory; and tho' I am otherwi&s;e
a perfect Stranger to him, I am very well
plea&s;ed to tran&s;mit to Po&s;terity the Account
of his Behaviour, as an Example to all good
Chri&s;tians to imitate on the like Occa&s;ions.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="215">
&startq;He found him&s;elf mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion
at the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor Creatures, whom
he &s;aw as afore&s;aid in that mi&s;erable Condi|tion
upon the Sands, and the fir&s;t Thing he
did, he made Application to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e
Officers for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Boats and
Men, to &s;ave the Lives of as many as they
could come at, the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Men rude|ly
refus'd, either to &s;end their Men, or to
part with their Boats.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Provoked with the unnatural Carriage of
the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Officers, he calls the
People about him; and finding &s;ome of
the Common People began to be more than
ordinarily affected with the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of
their Countrymen, and as he thought a lit|tle
enclin'd to venture; he made a general
Offer to all that would venture out, that he
would pay them out of his own Pocket. 5 <HI>s.
per head</HI> for all the Men who&s;e Lives they
could &s;ave, upon this Propo&s;al &s;everal offer|ed
them&s;elves to go, if he would furni&s;h 'em
with Boats.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Finding the main Point clear, and that he
had brought the Men to be willing, he with
their A&s;&s;i&s;tance took away the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e
Boats by Force; and tho' he knew he could
not ju&s;tify it, and might be brought into
Trouble for it, and particularly if it were
<PB N="202" REF="216">
lo&s;t, might be oblig'd to pay for it, yet he
re&s;olv'd to venture that, rather than hazard the
lo&s;s of his De&s;ign, for the &s;aving &s;o many poor
Men's Lives, and having Mann'd their Boat
with a Crew of &s;tout hone&s;t Fellows, he with
them took away &s;everal other Boats from o|ther
Per&s;ons, who made u&s;e of them only to
Plunder and Rob, not regarding the Di&s;tre&s;|&s;es
of the poor Men.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Being thus provided both with Men and
Boats he &s;ent them off, and by this means
brought on Shore above 200 Men, who&s;e
Lives a few Minutes after, mu&s;t infallibly
ha' been lo&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nor was this the End of his Care, for
when the Tide came in, and 'twas too late to
go off again, for that all that were left were
&s;wallow'd up with the Raging of the Sea, his
Care was then to relieve the poor Creatures,
who he had &s;av'd, and who almo&s;t dead
with Hunger and Cold, were naked and
&s;tarving.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And fir&s;t he applied him&s;elf to the Queen's
Agent <HI>for Sick and Wounded Seamen,</HI> but
he would not relieve them with One Penny,
whereupon, at his own Charge, he furni&s;h'd
them with Meat, Drink and Lodging.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="217">
&startq;The next Day &s;everal of them died, the
Extremities they had &s;uffer'd, having too
much Ma&s;ter'd their Spirits, the&s;e he was
forc'd to bury al&s;o at his own Charge, the A|gent
&s;till refu&s;ing to Disbur&s;e one Penny.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;After their Refre&s;hment the poor Men a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
by the Mayor, made a fre&s;h Applicati|on
to the Agent for Conduct Money to help
them up to <HI>London,</HI> but he an&s;wer'd he had
no Order, and would Disbur&s;e nothing,
whereupon the Mayor gave them all Mo|ney
in their Pockets, and Pa&s;&s;es to
<HI>Graves-End.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I wi&s;h I could &s;ay with the &s;ame Freedom,
that he receiv'd the Thanks of the Govern|ment,
and Reimbur&s;ement of his Money as
he de&s;erv'd, but in this I have been inform'd,
he met with great Ob&s;tructions and Delays,
tho' at la&s;t, after long Attendance, upon a
right Application I am inform'd he obtain'd
the repayment of his Money, and &s;ome
&s;mall Allowance for his Time &s;pent in &s;ollici|ting
for it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nor can the Damage &s;uffered in the River
of <HI>Thames</HI> be forgot. It was a &s;trange &s;ight to
&s;ee all the Ships in the River blown away,
the Pool was &s;o clear, that, as I remember,
not above 4 Ships were left between the Up|per
part of <HI>Wapping,</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff Cro&s;s,</HI> for
<PB N="204" REF="218">
the Tide being up at the Time when the
Storm blew with the greate&s;t violence. No
Anchors or Landfa&s;t, no Cables or Moor|ings
would hold them, the Chains which lay
cro&s;s the River for the mooring of Ships, all
gave way.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Ships breaking loo&s;e thus, it mu&s;t be
a &s;trange &s;ight to &s;ee the Hurry and Confu&s;ion
of it, and as &s;ome Ships had no Body at all
on Board, and a great many had none but a
Man or Boy left on Board ju&s;t to look after
the Ve&s;&s;el, there was nothing to be done,
but to let every Ve&s;&s;el drive whither and
how &s;he would.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tho&s;e who know the Reaches of the Ri|ver,
and how they lye, know well enough,
that the Wind being at South We&s;t We&s;ter|ly,
the Ve&s;&s;els would naturally drive into the
Bite or Bay from <HI>Ratcliff Cro&s;s</HI> to <HI>Lime-hou&s;e
Hole,</HI> for that the River winding about a|gain
from thence towards the New Dock at
<HI>Deptford,</HI> runs almo&s;t due South We&s;t, &s;o
that the Wind blew down one Reach, and up
another, and the Ships mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity
drive into the bottom of the Angle between
both.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This was the Ca&s;e, and as the Place is not
large, and the Number of Ships very great,
the force of the Wind had driven them &s;o in|to
<PB N="205" REF="219">
one another, and laid them &s;o upon one
another as it were in heaps, that I think a
Man may &s;afely defy all the World to do
the like.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Author of this Collection had the curi|o&s;ity
the next day to view the place, and to ob|&s;erve
the po&s;ture they lay in, which neverthe|le&s;s
'tis impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe; there lay, by
the be&s;t Account he could take, few le&s;s than
700 &s;ail of Ships, &s;ome very great ones be|tween
<HI>Shadwel</HI> and <HI>Limehou&s;e</HI> inclu&s;ive, the
po&s;ture is not to be imagined, but by them
that &s;aw it, &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els lay heeling off with
the Bow of another Ship over her Wa&s;te,
and the Stem of another upon her Fore-Ca|&s;tle,
the Bolt&s;prits of &s;ome drove into the
Cabbin Windows of others; &s;ome lay with
their Sterns to&s;&s;ed up &s;o high, that the Tide
flowed into their Fore-Ca&s;tles before they
cou'd come to Rights; &s;ome lay &s;o leaning
upon others, that the undermo&s;t Ve&s;&s;els
wou'd &s;ink before the other could float; the
numbers of Ma&s;ts, Boltiprits and Yards &s;plit
and broke, the &s;taving the Heads, and Sterns
and Carved Work, the tearing and de&s;tructi|on
of Rigging, and the &s;queezing of Boats to
pieces between the Ships, is not to be reckon|ed;
but there was hardly a Ve&s;&s;el to be
&s;een that had not &s;uffer'd &s;ome damage or o|ther
in one or all of the&s;e Articles.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="220">
&startq;There was &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els &s;unk in this hurry,
but as they were generally light Ships, the
damage was chiefly to the Ve&s;&s;els; but there
were two Ships &s;unk with great quantity of
Goods on Board, the <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> Galley was &s;unk
at <HI>Lime-hou&s;e,</HI> being a great part laden with
Bale Goods for the <HI>Streights,</HI> and the <HI>Sarah</HI>
Gally lading for <HI>Leghorn,</HI> &s;unk at an Anchor
at <HI>Blackwall;</HI> and though &s;he was afterwards
weighed and brought on &s;hore, yet her back
was broke, or &s;o otherwi&s;e di&s;abled, as &s;he
was never fit for the Sea; there were &s;everal
Men drown'd in the&s;e la&s;t two Ve&s;&s;els, but
we could never come to have the particular
number.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Near <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> &s;everal Ships drove on &s;hoar
below <HI>Tilbury</HI> Fort, and among them five
bound for the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> but as the &s;hoar
is ouzy and &s;oft, the Ve&s;&s;els &s;at upright and
ea&s;y, and here the high Tides which follow'd,
and which were the ruin of &s;o many in other
places, were the deliverance of all the&s;e Ships
who&s;e lading and value was very great, for
the Tide ri&s;ing to an unu&s;ual height, floated
them all off, and the damage was not &s;o great
as was expected.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If it be expected I &s;hould give an account
of the lo&s;s, and the particulars relating to
&s;mall Craft, <HI>as the Sailors call it,</HI> in the River
<PB N="207" REF="221">
it is to look for what is impo&s;&s;ible, other than
by generals.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Watermen tell us of above 500 Wher|ries
lo&s;t, mo&s;t of which were not &s;unk only
but da&s;ht to pieces one again&s;t another, or
again&s;t the Shores and Ships, where they
lay: Ship Boats without number were driven
about in every corner, &s;unk and &s;taved, and
about 300 of them is &s;uppo&s;ed to be lo&s;t.
Above 60 Barges and Lighters were found
driven foul of the <HI>Bridge;</HI> &s;ome Printed ac|counts
tell us of &s;ixty more &s;unk or &s;taved
between the <HI>Bridge</HI> and <HI>Hammer&s;mith.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Abundance of Lighters and Barges drove
quite thro' the <HI>Bridge,</HI> and took their fate
below, where of many were lo&s;t, &s;o that we
Reckon by a mode&s;t account above 100
Lighters and Barges lo&s;t and &s;poil'd in the
whole, not reckoning &s;uch as with &s;mall
damage were recovered.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In all this confu&s;ion it could not be, but
that many Lives were lo&s;t, but as the <HI>Thames</HI>
often times Buries tho&s;e it drowns, there
has been no account taken. Two Water|men
at <HI>Black Fryars</HI> were drowned, endea|vouring

I have &s;een, about 22 People were drown'd
<PB N="208" REF="222">
in the River upon this &s;ad occa&s;ion, which
con&s;idering all circum&s;tances is not a great
many, and the damage to Shipping computed
with the va&s;t number of Ships then in the Ri|ver,
the Violence of the Storm, and the
heighth of the Tide, confirms me in the Truth
of that Opinion, which I have heard ma|ny
skilful Men own, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Ri|ver
of <HI>Thames</HI> is the be&s;t Harbour of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The highth of the Tide, as I have already
ob&s;erv'd, did no great damage in the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> and I find none of the Levels of Mar&s;hes,
which lye on both &s;ides the River overflowed

and on both &s;ides in <HI>London,</HI> and the

had a great &s;hare of the Damage.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In <HI>King Road</HI> at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the Damage by

vouch'd, but as they are all true
in &s;ub&s;tance, they &s;o far to be depended
upon, and if there is any mi&s;take it relates
to Numbers, and quantity only.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;From <HI>Yarmouth</HI> we expected terrible
News, nd every one was impatient till they
&s;aw the Accounts from thence, for as there
was a very great Fleet there, both of lader
Colliers, <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Men, and others, there was
nothing to be expected but a dreadful De|&s;truction
among them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But it pleas'd God to order Things there
that the lo&s;s was not in Proportion like
what it was in other Places, not but that it
was very great too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The <HI>Re&s;erve</HI> Man of War was come i$
but a day or two before, Convoy to the
great Fleet from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the Captain, Sur$geon
and Clerk, who after &s;o long a Voyag$
went on Shoar with two Boats to refre&s;t
them&s;elves, and buy Provi&s;ions, had th$
Mortification to &s;tand on Shoar, and &s;ee th$
Ship &s;ink before their Faces; &s;he foundred a$bout
11-a-Clock, and as the Sea went to
high for any help to go off from the Shoa$
to them, &s;o their own Boats being both o$
Shoar, there was not one Man &s;av'd; on
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Ship driving from her Anchors, an
<PB N="211" REF="225">
running foul of a laden Collier &s;unk by his
&s;ide, but &s;ome of her Men were &s;av'd by
getting on Board the Collier; three or &s;our
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els were driven out to Sea, and
never heard of more; as for the Colliers,
tho' mo&s;t of them were driven from their
Anchors, yet going away to Sea, we have
not an account of many lo&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This next to the Providence of God, I give
this rea&s;on for, fir&s;t by all Relations it ap|pears
that the Storm was not &s;o violent far|ther
Northward, as it was there; and as it
was not &s;o Violent, &s;o neither did it conti|nue
&s;o long: Now tho&s;e Ships, who found
they could not ride it out in <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads,
but &s;lipping their Cables went away to Sea,
po&s;&s;ibly as they went away to the Northward,
found the Weather more moderate at lea&s;t, not
&s;o violent, but it might be borne with, to this
may be added, that 'tis well known to &s;uch
as u&s;e the Coa&s;t after they had run the
length of <HI>Flambro,</HI> they had the benefit of the
Weather Shoar, and pretty high land, which
if they took &s;helter under might help them
very much; the&s;e, with other Circum&s;tances,
made the Damage much le&s;s than every Bo|dy
expected, and yet as it was$ it was bad
enough as our Letter from <HI>Hull</HI> gives an
Account. At <HI>Grimsby</HI> it was &s;till wor&s;e as
to the Ships, where almo&s;t all the Ve&s;&s;els
<PB N="212" REF="226">
were blown out of the Road, and a great
many lo&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At <HI>Plymouth</HI> they felt a full Proportion of
the Storm in its utmo&s;t fury, the <HI>Edy&s;tone</HI> has
been mention'd already, but it was a dou|ble
lo&s;s in that, the light Hou&s;e had not
been long down, when the <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> a
homeward bound <HI>Virginia</HI> Man was &s;plit
upon the Rock, where that Building &s;tood,
and mo&s;t of her Men drowned.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Three other Merchant Ships were ca&s;t a|way
in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Road, and mo&s;t of their
Men lo&s;t: The <HI>Monk</HI> Man of War rod it
out, but was oblig'd to cut all her Ma&s;ts by
the Board, as &s;everal Men of War did in o|ther
places.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At <HI>Por&s;mouth</HI> was a great Fleet, as has
been noted already, &s;everal of the Ships
were blown quite out to Sea, whereof &s;ome
were never heard of more; the <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>
was heard off upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI>
where &s;he was lo&s;t with all their Men but
23; the <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> the <HI>Eagle</HI> advice Boat,
and the <HI>Litchfield</HI> Prize felt the &s;ame fate,
only &s;av'd their Men: From <HI>Cows</HI> &s;everal
Ships were driven out to Sea, whereof one
run on Shoar in <HI>Stokes-bay,</HI> one full of Sol|diers,
and two Merchant Men have never
<PB N="213" REF="227">
been heard off, as I could ever learn, abun|bance
of the Ships &s;av'd them&s;elves by cut|ting
down their Ma&s;ts, and other Stranded,
but by the help of the en&s;uing Tides got off
again.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Port&s;mouth, Plymouth, Weymouth,</HI> and mo&s;t
of our Sea Port Towns look'd as if they
had been Bombarded, and the Damage of
them is not ea&s;ily computed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Several Ships from the <HI>Downs</HI> were driven
oyer to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> and &s;ome &s;av'd
them&s;elves there; but &s;everal others were
lo&s;t there.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At <HI>Falmouth</HI> 11 Sail of Ships were &s;tran|ded
on the Shoar, but mo&s;t of them got off
again.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In <HI>Bar&s;table</HI> Harbour, a Merchant Ship
outward bound was over-&s;et, and the ex|pre&s;s
advice Boat very much &s;hatter'd, and the
Key of the Town almo&s;t de&s;troy'd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis endle&s;s to attempt any farther De|&s;cription
of Lo&s;&s;es, no place was free either
by Land or by Sea, every thing that was ca|pable
felt the fury of the Storm; and 'tis
hard to &s;ay, whether was greater the lo&s;s by
Sea, or by Land; the Multitude of brave
<PB N="214" REF="228">
&s;tout Sailors is a melancholy &s;ubject, and if
there be any difference gives the &s;ad Bal|lance
to the Account of the Damage by Sea.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We had an Account of about 11 or 12
Ships droven over for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI>
mo&s;t of which were lo&s;t, but the Men &s;aved,
&s;o that by the be&s;t Ca&s;culation I can make,
we have not lo&s;t le&s;s than 150 &s;ail of Ve&s;|&s;els
of all &s;orts by the Storm; the number
of Men and other damages, are Calculated
el&s;ewhere.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We have &s;everal Branches of this Story
which at fir&s;t were too ea&s;ily credited, $nd
put in Print, but upon more &s;trict examina|on,
and by the di&s;coveries of Time, ap|pear'd
otherwi&s;e, and therefore are not &s;et down.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was in the de&s;ign to have Collected the
&s;everal Accounts of the fatal effects of the
Tempe&s;t abroad in Foreign Parts; but as
our Accounts came in from thence too im|perfect
to be depended upon; the Collector
of the&s;e Papers could not be &s;atisfied to offer
them to the World, being willing to keep
as much as po&s;&s;ible to the Terms of his Pre|face.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="229">
&startq;We are told there is an Ab&s;tract to the &s;ame
purpo&s;e with this in <HI>France,</HI> Printed at <HI>Paris,</HI>
and which contains a &s;trange variety of Ac|cidents
in that Country.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If a particular of this can be obtained, the
Author Promi&s;es to put it into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
adding to them the other Accounts, which
the re&s;t of the World can afford, together
with &s;ome other Additions of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Af|fairs,
which could not be obtain'd in time
here &s;hall make up the &s;econd part of this
Work.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In the mean time the Reader may ob&s;erve,
<HI>France</HI> felt the general &s;hock the Peers, and
Ricebank at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> the Harbour at <HI>Haver
de Grace,</HI> the Towns of <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Bulloign</HI>
give us &s;trange Accounts.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All the Ve&s;&s;els in the Road before <HI>Dun|kirk,</HI>
being 23 or 27, I am not certain, were
da&s;ht in pieces again&s;t the Peer Heads, not
one excepted, that &s;ide being a Lee &s;hoar,
the rea&s;on is plain, there was no going off to
Sea; and had it it been &s;o with us in the
<HI>Downs</HI> or <HI>Yarmonth</HI> Roads, it would have
fared with us in the &s;ame manner, for had
there been no going off to Sea, 300 &s;ail in
<HI>Yarmouth</HI> Road had inevitably peri&s;ht.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="230">
At <HI>Diepe</HI> the like mi&s;chief happened, and
&startq;in proportion <HI>Paris</HI> felt the effects of it, as
bad as <HI>Loudon,</HI> and as a Gentleman who came
from thence &s;ince that time, affirmed it to
me it was much wor&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All the N. Ea&s;t Countries felt it, in <HI>Hol|land</HI>
our accounts in general are very di&s;mal,
but the Wind not being N. W. as at former
Storms, the Tyde did not drown them, no$
beat &s;o directly upon their Sea Wall.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is not very irrational to Judge, that had
the Storm beat more to the North We&s;t, it
mu&s;t have d$$en the Sea upon them in &s;uch
a ma$$$ that all their Dikes and Dams
could not have &s;u&s;tained it, and what the
con&s;equence of &s;uch an Inundation might ha'
been they can be&s;t judge, who remember the
la&s;t terrible Irruption of the Sea there, which
drowned &s;everal thou&s;and People, and Cattle
without number.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But as our Foreign Accounts were not &s;a|tisfactory
enough to put into this Collection,
where we have promi&s;ed to limit our &s;elves

to a farther de&s;cription as before.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Several of our Ships were driven over to

<P>&startq;The <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> a Second Rate, on Board

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HER Maje&s;ty's Ship <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> a &s;e|cond
Rate of 96 Guns, commanded
by Sir <HI>Stafford Fairborne,</HI> Vice-Admiral of the
Red, and under him Captain <HI>Richard Canning,</HI>
&s;ailed from the <HI>Downs</HI> the 24th of <HI>November</HI>
la&s;t, in Company with &s;even other Capital
Ships, under the Command of the Honou|rable
Sir <HI>Cloude&s;ley Shovel,</HI> Admiral of the
White, in their return from <HI>Leghorn</HI> up the
River. They anchored that Night off of the
<HI>Long-&s;and-head.</HI> The next Day &s;truck Yards
and Top-Ma&s;ts. The 27th about three in
the Morning, the Wind at We&s;t South We&s;t,
encrea&s;ed to a Hurricane, which drove the <HI>A&s;|&s;ociation</HI>
from her Anchors. The Night was
exceeding dark, but what was more Dreadful,
the <HI>Galloper,</HI> a very dangerous Sand, was un|der
her Lee; &s;o that &s;he was in Danger of
&s;triking upon it, beyond the Power of Man
to avoid it. Driving thus at the Mercy of
the Waves, it plea&s;ed God, that about five a
Clock &s;he pa&s;&s;ed over the tail of the <HI>Galloper</HI>
in &s;even Fathom of Water. The Sea boi&s;te|rous
and angry, all in a Foam, was ready to
<PB N="219" REF="233">
&s;wallow her up; and the Ship received at that
time a Sea on her Starboard-&s;ide, which beat
over all, broke and wa&s;hed &s;everal half Ports,
and forced in the entering Port. She took in
&s;uch a va&s;t quantity of Water, that it kept
her down upon her &s;ide, and every Body be|liev'd,
that &s;he could not have ri&s;en again,
had not the Water been &s;peedily let down into
the hold by &s;cuttling the Decks. During this
Con&s;ternation two of the Lower-Gun-Deck-Ports
were pre&s;&s;ed open by this mighty weight
of Water, the mo&s;t hazardous Accident, next
to touching the Ground, that could have hap|pened
to us. But the Port, that had been
forced open, being readily &s;ecured by the Di|rection
and Command of the Vice-Admiral,
who, though much indi&s;po&s;ed, was upon
Deck all that time, prevented any farther
Mi&s;chief. As the Ship &s;till drove with the
Wind, &s;he was not long in this Shoal, (where
it was impo&s;&s;ible for any Ship to have lived
at that time) but came into deeper Water,
and then &s;he had a &s;moother Sea. However
the Hurricane did not abate, but rather &s;eem|ed
to gather Strength. For Words were no
&s;ooner uttered, but they were carried away
by the Wind, &s;o that although tho&s;e upon
Deck &s;poke loud and clo&s;e to one another, yet
they could not often di&s;tingui&s;h what was
&s;aid; and when they opened their Mouths,
their Breath was almo&s;t taken away. Part
<PB N="220" REF="234">
of the Sprit Sail, tho' fa&s;t furled, was blown
away from the Yard. A Ten-Oar-Boat, that
was la&s;hed on her Starboard-&s;ide, was often
hove up by the Strength of the Wind, and o|ver-&s;et
upon her Gun-Wale. We plainly &s;aw
the Wind skimming up the Water, as if it had
been Sand, carrying it up into the Air, which
was then &s;o thick and gloomy, that Day light,
which &s;hould have been comfortable to us,
did, but make it appear more gha&s;tly. The
Sun by intervals peeped through the corner of
a Cloud, but &s;oon di&s;appearing, gave us a
more melancholick Pro&s;pect of the Weather.
About 11 a Clock it di&s;per&s;ed the Clouds,
and the Hurricane abated into a more mode|rate
Storm, which drove us over to the Bank
of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and thence along the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> to the entrance of the
Elb, where the 4th of <HI>December</HI> we had almo&s;t
as violent a Storm, as when we drove from
our Anchors, the Wind at North We&s;t, dri|ving
us directly upon the Shoar. So that
We mu&s;t all have inevitably peri&s;hed, had not
God mercifully favoured us about 10 a Clock
at night with a South We&s;t Wind, which gave
us an opportunity to put to Sea. But being
afterwards driven near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway,</HI>
the Ship wanting Anchors and Cables, our
Wood and Candles wholly expended; no Beer
on Board, nor any $$hing el&s;e in lieu; every
one reduced to one quart of Water <HI>per</HI> Day,
<PB N="221" REF="235">
the Men, who had been harra&s;&s;ed at <HI>Belle I&s;le,</HI>
and in our <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Voyage, now jaded
by the continual Fatigues of the Storms, fall|ing
&s;ick every Day, the Vice-Admiral in this
exigency thought it advi&s;able to put into <HI>Got|tenbourgh,</HI>
the only Port where we could hope
to be &s;upplied. We arrived there the 11th of
<HI>December,</HI> and having witout lo&s;t of time
got Anchors and Cables from <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and
Provi&s;ions from <HI>Gottenbourgh,</HI> we &s;ailed thence
the Third of <HI>January,</HI> with twelve Merchant
Men under our Convoy, all loaden with
Stores for her Maje&s;ty's Navy. The Eleventh
following we prevented four <HI>French</HI> Privateers
from taking four of our Store-Ships. At
Night we anchored off the <HI>Long-Sand-Head.</HI>
Weighed again the next Day, but &s;oon came
to an Anchor, becau&s;e it was very hazy Wea|ther.
Here we rid again&s;t a violent Storm,
which was like to have put us to Sea. But af|ter
three Days very bad Weather, we weigh|ed
and arrived to the <HI>Buoy of the Nore</HI> the 23d
of <HI>January,</HI> having run very great Risks a|mong
the Sands. For we had not only con|trary
Winds, but al&s;o very tempe&s;tuous
Winds. We lo&s;t 28 Men by Sickne&s;s, con|tracted
by the Hard&s;hips which they endur'd
in the bad Weather; and had not Sir <HI>Stafford
Fairborne</HI> by his great care and diligence, got
the Ship out of <HI>Gottenbourgh,</HI> and by that pre|vented

<P>I Receiv'd yours, wherein you acquaint me

with that Applau&s;e and Acceptance from the
World which it de&s;erves; but am in no capaci|ty

us in the&s;e Parts. I doubt not but your Intelli|gence
in general from the Northern Parts of the
Nation, &s;upplies you with as little Matter as
what you have from the&s;e hereabouts, it having
been le&s;s violent and mi&s;chievous that way.
Some Stacks of Chimneys were over-turn'd here,
<PB N="226" REF="241">
and from one of them a little Child of my own
was (thanks be to God) almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly
pre&s;erv'd, with a Maid that lay in the Room
with him. I hear of none el&s;e this way that
was &s;o much as in danger, the Storm beginning
here later than I perceive it did in &s;ome other
Places, its greate&s;t Violence being betwixt 7 and
8 in the Morning, when mo&s;t People were &s;tir|ring.</P>
<P>The
Earthquake, which the Publick Accounts
mention to have happen'd at <HI>Hull</HI> and <HI>Lincoln</HI>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am afraid that you will believe me very
rude, that yours, which I receiv'd the 12th
of <HI>April,</HI> has not &s;ooner receiv'd &s;uch an An|&s;wer
as you expect and de&s;ire, and truly I think
<PB N="227" REF="242">
de&s;erve; for, a De&s;ign &s;o generous, as to un|dertake
to tran&s;mit to Po&s;terity, A Memorial
of the dreadful Effects of the late terrible Tem|pe&s;t
(that when God's Judgments are in the
World, they may be made &s;o publick, as to in|gage
the Inhabitants of the Earth to learn Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s)
ought to receive all po&s;&s;ible Encou|ragement.</P>
<P>But
the true Rea&s;on why I writ no &s;ooner,
was, Becau&s;e, by the mo&s;t diligent Enquiries I
cou'd make, I cou'd not learn what Harm that
dreadful Tempe&s;t did in the <HI>Humber;</HI> neither
indeed can I yet give you any exact Account of
it: for, the great Mi&s;chief was done in the
Night; which was &s;o Pitch-dark, that of above
80 Ships that then rid in the <HI>Humber,</HI> about
<HI>Grimsby</HI> Road, very few e&s;cap'd &s;ome Lo&s;s or
other, and none of 'em were able to give a
Relation of any body but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Account of the Effects of the Storm
in the <HI>Humber,</HI> that I have yet met with, I re|ceived
but Ye&s;terday, from Mr. <HI>Peter Walls,</HI>
who is Ma&s;ter of that Watch-Tower, call$d the
<HI>Spurn-Light,</HI> at the <HI>Humber</HI> Mouth, and was
pre&s;ent there on the Night of the 26th of <HI>No|vember,</HI>
the fatal Night of the Storm.</P>
<P>He did verily believe that his Pharos (which
is above 20 Yards high) wou'd have been
blown down; and the Tempe&s;t made the Fire
in it burn &s;o vehemently, that it melted down
the Iron-bars on which it laid, like Lead; &s;o
that they were forced, when the Fire was by
this means almo&s;t extingui&s;hed; to put in new
<PB N="228" REF="243">
Bars, and kindle the Fire a-fre&s;h, which they
kept in till the Morning Light appear'd: And
then <HI>Peter Walls</HI> ob&s;erved about &s;ix or &s;even and
twenty Sail of Ships, all driving about the
<HI>Spurn-Head,</HI> &s;ome having cut, others broke their
Cables, but all di&s;abled, and render'd helple&s;s.
The&s;e were a part of the two Fleets that then
lay in the <HI>Humber,</HI> being put in there by &s;tre&s;s
of Weather a day or two before, &s;ome from
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the re&s;t of 'em <HI>Colliers,</HI> to and from
<HI>Nowca&s;tle.</HI> Of the&s;e, three were driven upon
an I&s;land call'd the <HI>Den,</HI> within the <HI>Spurn</HI> in
the Mouth of the <HI>Humber.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e no &s;ooner touch'd Ground,
but &s;he over-&s;et, and turn'd up her Bottom;
out of which, only one of &s;ix (the Number of
that Ship's Company) was lo&s;t, being in the
Shrowds: the other five were taken up by the
&s;econd Ship, who had &s;av'd their Boat. In this
Boat were &s;aved all the Men of the three Ships
aforementioned (except as before excepted)
and came to Mr. <HI>Walls</HI>'s Hou&s;e, at the <HI>Spurn-Head,</HI>
who got them good Fires, and all Ac|commodations
nece&s;&s;ary for them in &s;uch a Di|&s;tre&s;s.
The &s;econd Ship having no body aboard,
was driven to Sea, with the Violence of the
Tempe&s;t, and never &s;een or heard of more.
The third, which was then a-ground, was (as
he &s;uppo&s;es) broken up and driven; for no|thing,
but &s;ome Coals that were in her, was
to be &s;een the next Morning.</P>
<P>Another Ship, the Day after, <HI>viz.</HI> the 27th
of <HI>November,</HI> was riding in <HI>Grimsby</HI> Road, and
<PB N="229" REF="244">
the Ships Company (except two Boys) being
gone a-&s;hore, the Ship, with the two Lads in
her, drive directly out of <HI>Humber,</HI> and was lo&s;t,
tho' 'tis verily believ'd the two Boys were &s;aved
by one of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Ships, or Convoys.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day, in the Morning, one <HI>John
Baines,</HI> a <HI>Yarmouth</HI> Ma&s;ter, was in his Ship, ri|ding
in <HI>Grimsby</HI> Road, and by the Violence of
the Storm, &s;ome other Ships coming foul upon
him, part of his Ship was broken down, and
was driven towards Sea; whereupon he ancho|red
under <HI>Kiln&s;ey-Land,</HI> and with his Crew came
&s;afe a-&s;hore, in his Boat, but the Ship was ne|ver
&s;een more.</P>
<P>The remainder of the &s;ix or &s;even and twenty
Sail afore&s;aid, being (as was before ob&s;erved)
driven out of the <HI>Humber,</HI> very few, if any of
'em, were ever heard of; and 'tis rationally be|liev'd,
that all, or the mo&s;t of them, peri&s;hed.
And indeed, altho' the Storm was not &s;o vio|lent
here as it was about <HI>Port&s;mouth, Yarmouth</HI>
Roads, and the Southern Coa&s;t, yet the Crews
of the three Ships above-mentioned declare, that
they were never out in &s;o di&s;mal a Night as that
was of the 26th of <HI>November,</HI> in which the con|&s;iderable
Fleet afore&s;aid rid in <HI>Grimsby</HI> Road in
the <HI>Humber;</HI> for mo&s;t of the 80 Sail broke from
their Anchors, and run foul one upon another;
but by rea&s;on of the Darkne&s;s of the Night,
they cou'd &s;ee very little of the Mi&s;chief that
was done.</P>
<P>This is the be&s;t Account I can give you at
pre&s;ent of the Effects of the Tempe&s;t in the
<PB N="230" REF="245">
<HI>Humber;</HI> whereas had the Enquiry been made
immediately after the Storm was over, a great
many more of remarkable Particulars might
have been di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>As to the Earthquake here, tho' I perceiv'd
it not my &s;elf (being then walking to vi&s;it a
&s;ick Pari&s;honer) yet it was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt by &s;o
many Hundreds, that I cannot in the lea&s;t que|&s;tion
the Truth and Certainty of it.</P>
<P>It happen'd here, and in the&s;e Parts, upon
<HI>Innocent</HI>'s Day, the 28th of <HI>December,</HI> being
<HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> about Five of the Clock in the Even|ing,
or thereabout. Soon after I gave as parti|cular
Account as I cou'd learn of it, to that in|genious
Antiquary Mr. <HI>Thorsby</HI> of <HI>Leeds</HI> in <HI>York|&s;hire,</HI>
but had no time to keep a Copy of my
Letter to him, nor have I lei&s;ure to tran&s;cribe a
Copy of this to you, having &s;o con&s;tant a Fa|tigue
of Parochial bu&s;ine&s;s to attend; nor will
my Memory &s;erve me to recollect all the Cir|cum&s;tances
of that Earthquake, as I &s;ent them
to Mr. <HI>Thoresby;</HI> and po&s;&s;ibly he may have
communicated that Letter to you, or will upon
your lea&s;t intimation, being a generous Per&s;on,
who loves to communicate any thing that may
be &s;erviceable to the Publick.</P>
<P>However, le&s;t I &s;hou'd &s;eem to decline the
gratifying your Reque&s;t, I will recollect, and
here &s;et down, &s;uch of the Circum&s;tances of that
Earthquake as do at pre&s;ent occur to my Me|mory.</P>
<P>It
came with a Noi&s;e like that of a Coach
in the Streets, and mightily &s;hak'd both the
<PB N="231" REF="246">
Gla&s;s Windows, Pewter, <HI>China</HI> Pots and
Di&s;hes, and in &s;ome places threw them down
off the Shelves on which they &s;tood. It did ve|ry
little Mi&s;chief in this Town, except the throw|ing
down a Piece of one Chimney. Several Per|&s;ons
thought that a great Dog was got under
the Chair they &s;at upon; and other fell from
their Seats, for fear of falling. It frighted &s;eve|ral
Per&s;ons, and caus'd 'em for a while to break
off their Reading, or Writing, or what they
were doing.</P>
<P>They felt but one Shake here: but a Gentle|man
in <HI>Nottingham&s;hire</HI> told me, that being then
lame upon his Bed, he felt three Shakes, like
the three Rocks of a Cradle, to and again.</P>
<P>At <HI>Laceby</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and in &s;everal other
Parts of that County, as well as of the Counties
of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Earthquake was
felt very &s;en&s;ibly; and particularly at <HI>Laceby</HI> a|fore&s;aid.
There happen'd this remarkable Story.</P>
<P>On <HI>Innocent</HI>'s Day, in the Afternoon, &s;everal
Morrice-Dancers came thither from <HI>Grimsby;</HI>
and after they had Danc'd and play'd their
Tricks, they went towards <HI>Alesby,</HI> a little Town
not far off: and as they were going about Five
a Clock, they felt two &s;uch terrible Shocks of
the Earth, that they had much ado to hold their
Feet, and thought the Ground was ready to o|pen,
and &s;wallow 'em up. Whereupon think|ing
that God was angry at 'em for playing the
Fool, they return'd immediately to <HI>Laceby</HI> in a
great Fright, and the next Day home, not da|ring
to pur&s;ue their intended Circuit and Dan|cing.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="247">
I think 'tis the Ob&s;ervation of Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> that
upon an Earthquake the Earth &s;ends forth noi|&s;ome
Vapours which infect the Air, as the Air
does our Bodies: and accordingly it has prov'd
here, where we have ever &s;ince had a mo&s;t
&s;ickly time, and the greate&s;t Mortality that has
been in this Place for 15 Years la&s;t pa&s;t: and &s;o

<HI>England.</HI> This, SIR, is the be&s;t Account I can

<HEAD>Part of two Letters from Mr. Thoresby,
F. R. S. to the Publi&s;her, concerning an
Earthquake, which happen'd in &s;ome Pla|cos
of the North of England, the <DATE>28th of
December 1703.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>YOU have heard, no doubt, of the late
<HI>Earthquake</HI> that affected &s;ome part of the
<PB N="233" REF="248">
North, as the dreadful Storm did the South.
It being mo&s;t ob&s;ervable at <HI>Hull,</HI> I was de&s;irous
of an Account from thence that might be de|pended
upon; and therefore writ to the very
obliging Mr. <HI>Banks,</HI> Prebendary of <HI>York,</HI> who
being Vicar of <HI>Hull,</HI> was the mo&s;t &s;uitable Per|&s;on
I knew to addre&s;s my &s;elf unto: and he be|ing
plea&s;ed to favour me with a judicious Ac|count
of it, I will venture to communicate it to
you, with his pious Reflection thereupon. &startq;As
to the Earthquake you mention, it was felt
here on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 28th of the la&s;t Month,
which was <HI>Childermas</HI> Day, about three or
four Minutes after Five in the Evening. I con|fe&s;s
I did not feel it my &s;elf; for I was at that
moment walking to vi&s;it a &s;ick Gentleman,
and the Noi&s;e in the Streets, and my quick
Motion, made it impo&s;&s;ible, I believe, for me
to feel it: but it was &s;o almo&s;t univer&s;ally felt,
that there can be no manner of doubt of the
Truth of it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>Peers,</HI> my Reader, (who is an ingeni|ous
good Man) was then at his Study, and
Writing; but the heaving up of his Chair and
his Desk, the Shake of his Chamber, and
the rattling of his Windows, did &s;o amaze
him, that he was really affrighted, and was
forc'd for a while to give over his Work: and
there are twenty &s;uch In&s;tances among&s;t
Trade&s;men, too tedious to repeat. My Wife
was then in her Clo&s;et, and thought her <HI>China</HI>
would have come about her Ears, and my Fa|mily
felt the Chairs mov'd, in which they were
<PB N="234" REF="249">
&s;itting by the Kitchen Fire-&s;ide, and heard &s;uch
a Rattle of the Pewter and Windows as almo&s;t
affrighted them. A Gentlewoman not far off
&s;aid, her Chair lifted &s;o high, that &s;he thought
the great Dog had got under it, and to &s;ave
her &s;elf from falling, &s;lipt off her Chair. I
&s;ent to a Hou&s;e where part of a Chimney was
&s;hak'd down, to enquire of the particulars;
they kept Ale, and being pretty full of Com|pany
that they were merry, they did not per|ceive
the Shock, only heard the Pewter and
Gla&s;s-windows dance; but the Landlady's Mo|ther,
who was in a Chamber by her &s;elf, felt
the Shock &s;o violent, that &s;he verily believed
the Hou&s;e to be coming down (as part of the
Chimney afore mention'd did at the &s;ame Mo|ment)
and cried out in a Fright, and had fall'n,
but that &s;he catched hold of a Table. It came
and went &s;uddenly, and was attended with a
Noi&s;e like the Wind, though there was then a
perfect Calm.&endq;</P>
<P>From other Hands I have an Account that it
was felt in <HI>Beverly,</HI> and other Places; at <HI>South
Dalton</HI> particularly, where the Par&s;on's Wife
(my own Si&s;ter) being alone in her Chamber,
was &s;adly frighted with the heaving up of the

being then at a Gentleman's Hou&s;e in the Neigh|bourhood,
was amaz'd at the Moving of the

<HI>Selby,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Travers,</HI> a Mini&s;ter, being in

Mr. <HI>Peers</HI> above-mentioned; which minds me
of worthy Mr. <HI>Bank</HI>'s &s;erious Conclu&s;ion. &startq;And
now I hope you will not think it unbecoming
my Character to make this Reflection upon it,
<HI>viz.</HI> that Famines, Pe&s;tilences and Earthquakes,
are joyned by our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, as portend|ing
future Calamities, and particularly the De|&s;truction
of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> State; if
not the End of the World, St. <HI>Matth.</HI> 24. 7.
And if, as Philo&s;ophers ob&s;erve, tho&s;e gentler
Convul&s;ions within the Bowels of the Earth,
which give the Inhabitants but an ea&s;ie Jog,
do u&s;ually portend the Approach of &s;ome more
dreadful Earthquake; then &s;urely we have
Rea&s;on to fear the wor&s;t, becau&s;e I fear we
&s;o well de&s;erve it, and pray God of his infinite
Mercy to avert his future Judgments.&endq;</P>
<P>SInce my former Account of the Earthquake
at <HI>Hull,</HI> my Cou&s;in <HI>Cook&s;on</HI> has procured to
me the following Account from his Brother,
who is a Clergyman near <HI>Lincoln, viz,</HI> That he,
being about Five in the Evening, <HI>December</HI> the
20th pa&s;t, &s;et with a neighbouring Mini&s;ter at
his Hou&s;e about a Mile from <HI>Navenby,</HI> they
were &s;urpriz'd with a &s;udden Noi&s;e, as if it had
been of two or three Coaches driven furiou&s;ly
down the Yard, whereupon the Servant was
&s;ent to the Door, in Expectation of &s;ome Stran|gers;
but they quickly perceived what it was,
<PB N="236" REF="251">
by the &s;haking of the Chairs they &s;at upon; they
could perceive the very Stones move: the great|e&s;t
Damage was to the Gentlewoman of the
Hou&s;e, who was put into &s;uch a Fright, that
&s;he mi&s;carried two Days after. He writes, they
were put into a greater Fright upon the Fa&s;t-day;
when there was &s;o violent a Storm, they
verily thought the Church would have fallen up|on
them. We had al&s;o at <HI>Leedes</HI> a much great|er
Storm the Night preceding the Fa&s;t, and a
&s;tronger Wind that Day, than when the fatal
Storm was in the South; but a good Providence
timed this well, to quicken our too cold Devo|tions.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;hort Account I now &s;end to &s;hew
the Providence of God in the late Dread|ful
Storm, (if yet it comes not too late) I had
from the Mouth of the Gentleman him&s;elf,
Mr. <HI>Woodgate Gi&s;&s;er</HI> by Name, who is a Neigh|bour
of mine, living in St. <HI>Martin's-&s;treet</HI> in the
Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Martins</HI> in the Fields, and a Suf|ferer
in the common Calamity; is as follows,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Between Two and Three of the Clock in the
Morning, my Neighbour's Stack of Chimneys fell,
and broke down the Roof of my Garret into the
Pa&s;&s;age going up and down Stairs; upon which,
I thought it convenient to retire into the Kitchen
with my Family; where we had not been above
a Quarter of an Hour, before my Wife &s;ent her
Maid to fetch &s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries out of a Back
Parlour Clo&s;et, and as &s;he had &s;hut the Door,
and was upon her Return, the very &s;ame In|&s;tant
my Neighbour's Stack of Chimneys, on
the other Side of the Hou&s;e, fell upon my Stack,
and beat in the Roof, and &s;o drove down the
<PB N="238" REF="253">
&s;everal Floors through the Parlour into the
Kitchen, where the Maid was buried near Five
Hours in the Rubbi&s;h, without the lea&s;t Da|mage
or Hurt what&s;oever: This her miraculous
Pre&s;ervation was occa&s;ion'd (as I afterwards
with Surprize found) by her falling into a &s;mall
Cavity near the Bed, and afterwards (as &s;he
declar'd) by her creeping under the Te&s;ter that
lay hollow by Rea&s;on of &s;ome Joices that
lay athwart each other, which prevented her
peri&s;hing in the &s;aid Rubbi&s;h: About Eight in
the Morning, when I helped her out of the
Ruins, and asked her how &s;he did, and why
&s;he did not cry out for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;ince &s;he was
not (as I &s;uppos'd &s;he had been) dead, and &s;o
to let me know &s;he was alive; her An&s;wer was,
that truly &s;he for her Part had felt no Hurt, and
was not the lea&s;t affrighted, but lay quiet; and
which is more, even &s;lumbred until then.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ervation of my &s;elf, and the re&s;t of
my Family, about Eleven in Number, was,
next to the Providence of God, occa&s;ion'd by
our running into a Vault almo&s;t level with the
Kitchen upon the Noi&s;e and Alarm of the Fal|ling
of the Chimeys, which breaking through
three Floors, and about two Minutes in pa&s;&s;ing,
gave us the Opportunities of that Retreat.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for your charitable Vi&s;it not
long &s;ince; I could have heartily wi&s;h'd
your Bu&s;ine&s;s would have permitted you
to have made a little longer Stay at the
Par&s;onage, and then you might have taken
a &s;tricker View of the Ruins by the late terrible
Wind. Seeing you are pleas'd to de&s;ire from
me a more particular Account of that &s;ad Di&s;a|&s;ter;
I have for your fuller Satisfaction &s;ent you
the be&s;t I am able to give; and if it be not &s;o
perfect, and &s;o exact a one, as you may expect,
you may rely upon me it is a true, and a faith|ful
one, and that I do not impo&s;e upon you, or
the World in the lea&s;t in any Part of the follow|ing
Relation. I &s;hall not trouble you with the
Unea&s;ine&s;s the Family was under all the fore
Part of the Evening, even to a Fault, as I
thought, and told them, I did not then appre|hend
the Wind to be much higher than it had
been often on other Times; but went to Bed,
hoping we were more afraid than we needed to
have been: when in Bed, we began to be more
&s;en&s;ible of it, and lay mo&s;t of the Night awake,
dreading every Bla&s;t till about Four of the Clock
in the Morning, when to our thinking it &s;eemed
a little to abate; and then we fell a&s;leep, and
<PB N="240" REF="255">
&s;lept till about Six of the Clock, at which Time
my Wife waking, and calling one of her Maids
to ri&s;e, and come to the Children, the Maid ro&s;e,
and ha&s;ten'd to her; &s;he had not been up above
Half an Hour, but all on the &s;udden we heard
a prodigious Noi&s;e, as if part of the Hou&s;e had
been fallen down: I need not tell you the Con|&s;ternation
we were all in upon this Alarm; in a
Minutes Time, I am &s;ure, I was &s;urrounded
with all my Infantry, that I thought I &s;hould
have been overlay'd; I had not even Power to
&s;tir one Limb of me, much le&s;s to ri&s;e, though
I could not tell how to lie in Bed. The Shrieks
and the Cries of my dear Babes perfectly &s;tun'd
me; I think I hear them &s;till in my Ears, I &s;hall
not ea&s;ily, I am confident, if ever, forget them.
There I lay preaching Patience to tho&s;e little
Innocent Creatures, till the Day began to ap|pear.</P>
<P><HI>Preces &amp; La$hrimae,</HI> Prayers and Tears, the
Primitive Chri&s;tians Weapons, we had great
Plenty of to defend us withal; but had the
Hou&s;e all fallen upon our Heads, we were in
that Fright as we could &s;carce have had Power
to ri&s;e for the pre&s;ent, or do any thing for our
Security. Upon our ri&s;ing, and &s;ending a Ser|vant
to view what &s;he could di&s;cover, we &s;oon
under&s;tood that the Chimney was fallen down,
and that with its Fall it had beaten down a great
part of that End of the Hou&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the Upper
Chamber, and the Room under it, which was
the Room I cho&s;e for my Study: The Chim|ney
was thought as &s;trong, and as well built as
<PB N="241" REF="256">
mo&s;t in the Neighbourhood; and it &s;urpriz'd the
Ma&s;on (whom I immediately &s;ent for to view
it) to &s;ee it down: but that which was mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing
to me, was the Manner of its Falling;
had it fallen almo&s;t any other Way than that it
did, it mu&s;t in all Likelihood have killed the
much greater part of my Family, for no le&s;s than
Nine of us lay at that End of the Hou&s;e, my
Wife and Self, and Five Children, and Two
Servants, a Maid, and a Man then in my Pay,
and &s;o a Servant, though not by the Year: The
Bed my Elde&s;t Daughter and the Maid lay in
joyned as near as po&s;&s;ible to the Chimney, and
it was within a very few Yards of the Bed that
we lay in; &s;o that as <HI>David</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Jonathan,</HI>
there &s;eem'd to be but one &s;ingle Step between
Death and us, to all outward Appearance. One
Thing I cannot omit, which was very remarka|ble
and &s;urprizing: It plea&s;ed God &s;o to order
it, that in the Fall of the Hou&s;e two great Spars
&s;eem'd to fall &s;o as to pitch them&s;elves on an
End, and by that Means to &s;upport that other
Part of the Hou&s;e which adjoined to the Upper
Chamber; or el&s;e in all Likelihood, that mu&s;t
al&s;o have fallen too at the &s;ame Time. The
Carpenter (whom we &s;ent for forth with) when
he came, ask'd who plac'd tho&s;e two Support|ers,
&s;uppo&s;ing &s;omebody had been there before
him; and when he was told, tho&s;e two Spars
in the Fall &s;o plac'd them&s;elves, he could &s;carce
believe it po&s;&s;ible; it was done &s;o artificially,
that he declar'd, they &s;carce needed to have been
removed.</P>

of &s;o great and &s;o general Calamity; that we
truly repent us of tho&s;e Sins that have &s;o long

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have de&s;ired an Account of the Di|&s;a&s;ters
occa&s;ion'd by the late Tempe&s;t,
(which I can a&s;&s;ure you was in the&s;e Parts very
Terrible) &s;o I think my &s;elf oblig'd to let you
know, that there was a great Mixture of Mer|cy
with it: For though the Hurricane was
frightful, and very mi&s;chievous, yet God's gra|cious
Providence was therein very remarkable,
in re&s;training its Violence from an univer&s;al
De&s;truction: for then there was a Commotion
of the Elements of Air, Earth and Water,
which then &s;eemed to outvie each other in Mi&s;|chief;
for (in <HI>David</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ion, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22. 8.)
<HI>The Earth trembled and quak'd, the Foundations of
the Heavens mov'd and &s;hook, becau&s;e God was an|gry:</HI>
and yet, when all was given over for lo&s;t,
we found our &s;elves more &s;car'd than hurt; for
our Lives was given us for a Prey, and the
Tempe&s;t did us only &s;o much Damage, as to
make us &s;en&s;ible that it might have done us a
great deal more, had it not been rebuk'd by the
God of Mercy; the Care of who&s;e Providence
has been vi&s;ibly &s;een in our wonderful Pre&s;erva|tions.
My Self and Three more of this Pari&s;h
were then &s;trangely re&s;cued from the Grave:
J$$narrowly e&s;caped with my Life, where I ap|prehended
nothing of Danger; for going out a|bout
Midnight to give Orders to my Servants to
&s;ecure the Hou&s;e, and Reeks of Corn and Fur|&s;es
from being blown all away; as &s;oon as I
<PB N="244" REF="259">
mov'd out of the Place were I &s;tood, I heard &s;ome|thing
of a great Weight fall clo&s;e behind me,
and a little after going out with a Light, to &s;ee
what it was, I found it to be the great Stone
which covered the Top of my Chimney to keep
out the Wet; it was almo&s;t a Yard &s;quare, and
very thick, weighing about an Hundred and
Fifty Pound. It was blown about a Yard off
from the Chimney, and fell Edge-long, and cut
the Earth, about four Inches deep, exactly be|tween
my Foot-&s;teps; and a little after, whil&s;t
&s;itting under the Clavel of my Kitchen Chim|ney,
and reaching out my Arm for &s;ome Fewel
to mend the Fire, I was again &s;trangely pre&s;er|ved
from being knock'd on the Head by a Stone
of great Weight; it being about a Foot long,
Half a Foot braod, and two Inches thick: for
as &s;oon as I had drawn in my Arm, I felt &s;ome|thing
bru&s;h again&s;t my Elbow, and pre&s;ently I
heard the Stone fall clo&s;e by my Foot, a third
Part of which was broken off by the Violence
of the Fall, and skarr'd my Ancle, but did not
break the Skin; it had certainly killed me, had
it fallen while my Arm was extended. The
Top of my Wheat Rick was blown off, and
&s;ome of the Sheaves were carried a Stones Ca&s;t,
and with that Violence, that one of them, at
that Di&s;tance, &s;trock down one <HI>Daniel Fookes</HI> a
late Servant of the Lady <HI>Napier,</HI> and &s;o force|ably,
that he was taken up dead, and to all Ap|pearance
remain'd &s;o a great while; but at la&s;t
was happily recover'd to Life again. His Mo|ther,
poor Widow, was at the &s;ame time more
<PB N="245" REF="260">
fatally threatned at Home, and her Bed had
certainly prov'd her Grave, had not the fir&s;t
Noi&s;e awaken'd and &s;car'd her out of Bed; and
&s;he was &s;carce gotten to the Door, when the
Hou&s;e fell all in: The Smith's Wife likewi&s;e
being &s;car'd at &s;uch a Rate, leapt out of Bed,
with the little Child in her Arms, and ran ha&s;ti|ly
out of Doors naked, without Ho&s;e or Shooes,
to a Neighbour's Hou&s;e; and by that ha&s;ty
Flight, both their Lives were wonderfully pre|&s;erved.
The Sheets of Lead on <HI>Lytton</HI> Church,
were rolled up like Sheets of Parchment, and
blown off to a great Di&s;tance. At <HI>Strode,</HI> a
large Apple Tree, being about a Foot in Square,
was broken off cleverly like a Stick, about four
Foot from the Root, and carried over an Hedge
about ten Foot high; and ca&s;t, as if darted,
(with the Trunk forward) above fourteen
Yards off. And I am credibly inform'd, that at
<HI>Ellwood</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Abbotsbury,</HI> a large
Wheat Rick (belonging to one <HI>Jolyffe</HI>) was
cleverly blown, with its Staddle, off from the
Stones, and &s;et down on the Ground in very
good Order. I would fain know of the Athei&s;t

<HEAD>A great Pre&s;ervation in the late Storm.</HEAD>
<P>ABout Three of the Clock in the Morning,
the Violedce of the Wind blew down a
Stack of Chimneys belonging to the dwelling
Hou&s;e of Dr. <HI>Gideon Harvey,</HI> (&s;ituate in St.
<HI>Martin</HI>'s Lane over again&s;t the Street End) on the

Mr. <HI>Robert Richards</HI> an Apothecary, at the Sign

his Family lodges in the &s;ame. The Chimney
fell with that Force as made them pierce thro'
the Roofs and all the Floors, carrying them
down quite to the Ground. The two Families,
con&s;i&s;ting of Fourteen, Men, Women, and
Children, be&s;ides Three that came in from the

follows, a Footman that us'd to lie in the back
Garret, had not a Quarter of an Hour before re|mov'd
him&s;elf into the fore Garret, by which
means he e&s;cap'd the Danger: In the Room
under that lay Capt. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Child, of Two
Months old, in Bed with the Nur&s;e, and a Ser|vant
Maid lay on the Bed by her; the Nur&s;e's
Child lying in a Cribb by the Bed-&s;ide, which
was found, with the Child &s;afe in it, in the
Kitchen, where the Nur&s;e and Maid likewi&s;e
found them&s;elves; their Bed being &s;hatter'd in
<PB N="247" REF="262">
Pieces, and they a little bruis'd by falling down
Three Stories: Capt. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Child was in about
Two Hours found unhurt in &s;ome Pieces of the
Bed and Curtains, which had fallen through
Two Floors only, and hung on &s;ome broken
Rafters in that Place, which was the Parlour:
In the Room under This, being one Pair of
Stairs from the Street, and two from the Kitchen,
was Capt. <HI>Collier</HI> in his Bed, and his Wife ju&s;t by
the Bed-&s;ide, and her Maid a little behind her,
who likewi&s;e found her &s;elf in the Kitchin a lit|tle
bruis'd, and ran out to cry for Help for her
Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, who lay buried under the
Ruins: Mrs. <HI>Collier</HI> was, by the timely Aid of
Neighbours who remov'd the Rubbi&s;h from her,
taken out in about Half an Hours Time, having
receiv'd no Hurt but the Fright, and an Arm a
little bruis'd: Capt. <HI>Collier</HI> in about Half an Hour
more was likewi&s;e taken out unhurt. In the
Parlour were &s;itting Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> with his Wife,
the Three Neighbours, and the re&s;t of his Family,
a little Boy of about a Year old lying in the Cradle,
they all run out at the fir&s;t Noi&s;e, and e&s;cap'd;
Mrs <HI>Richards</HI> &s;taying a little longer than the re&s;t,
to pull the Cradle with her Child in it along
with her, but the Hou&s;e fell too &s;uddenly on it,
and buried the Child under the Ruins, a Rafter
fell on her Foot. and bruis'd it a little, at which
&s;he likewi&s;e made her E&s;cape, and brought in
the Neighbours, who &s;oon uncovered the Head
of the Cradle, and cutting it off, took the Child

Per&s;ons Lives, who were expos'd to the ut|mo&s;t
Hazards in that Hurricane: I &s;hall here give
you a &s;hort but true In&s;tance of the latter, which
&s;everal Per&s;ons can witne&s;s be&s;ides my &s;elf; and
if you think proper may in&s;ert the &s;ame in the
Book you de&s;ign for that Purpo&s;e; which is as
follows. At the <HI>Sara$en</HI>'s Head in <HI>Friday</HI> Street,
a Country Lad lodging three Pair of Stairs next
the Roof of the Hou&s;e, was wonderfully pre|&s;erv'd
from Death; for about Two a Clock that
<HI>Saturday</HI> Morning the 27th of <HI>November,</HI> (which
prov'd fatal to &s;o many) there fell a Chimney
upon the Roof, under which he lay, and beat
it down through the Ceiling (the Weight of the
Tiles, Bricks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being judged by a Workman
<PB N="249" REF="264">
to be about Five Hundred Weight) into the
Room, fell exactly between the Beds Feet and
Door of the Room, which are not Two Yards
di&s;tance from each other, it being but &s;mall:
the &s;udden Noi&s;e awaking the Lad, he jumps out
of Bed endeavouring to find the Door, but was
&s;topt by the great Du&s;t and falling of more
Bricks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and finding him&s;elf prevented, in
this Fear he got into Bed again, and remain'd
there till the Day Light, (the Bricks and Tiles
&s;till falling between-whiles about his Bed) and
then got up without any Hurt, or &s;o much as a
Tile or Brick falling on the Bed; the only thing
he complain'd of to me, was his being almo&s;t
choak'd with Du&s;t when he got out of Bed, or
put his Head out from under the Cloaths: There
was a great Weight of Tiles and Bricks, which
did not break through, as the Workmen in|form
me, ju&s;t over the Beds Te&s;ter, enough to
have cru&s;h'd him to Death, if they had fallen:
Thus he lay &s;afe among the Dangers that threat|ned
him, whil&s;t wakeful Providence pre&s;erv'd
him. And SIR, if this be worthy your taking
Notice of, I am ready to ju&s;tify the &s;ame. In

<P>THE De&s;ign of your Collecting the re|markable
Accidents of the late Storm co|ming
to my Hands, I thought my &s;elf obliged
to take this Opportunity of making a publick
Acknowledgment of the wonderful Providence
of Heaven to me, namely, the Pre&s;ervation of
my only Child from imminent Danger.</P>
<P>Two large Stacks of Chimneys, containing
each five Funnels, beat through the Roof, in
upon the Bed where &s;he lay, without doing her
the lea&s;t Harm, the Servant who lay with her
being very much brui&s;ed. There were &s;everal
Loads of Rubbi&s;h upon the Bed before my Child
was taken out of it.</P>
<P>This extraordinary Deliverance I de&s;ire al|ways
thankfully to remember.</P>
<P>I was &s;o nearly touch'd by this Accident, that
I could not take &s;o much notice as I intended of
this Storm; yet I ob&s;erv'd the Wind gradually
to encrea&s;e from One a Clock till a Quarter after
Five, or thereabouts: at which time it &s;eem'd
<PB N="252" REF="267">
to be at the highe&s;t; when every Gu&s;t did not
only return with greater Celerity, but al&s;o with
more Force.</P>
<P>From about a Quarter before Six it &s;en&s;ibly
decreas'd. I went often to the Door, at which
times I ob&s;erv'd, that every Gu&s;t was preceded
by &s;mall Fla&s;hes, which, to my Ob&s;ervation,
did not dart perpendicularly, but &s;eem'd rather
to skim along the Surface of the Ground; nor
did they appear to be of the &s;ame kind with the
common Light'ning Fla&s;hes.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot help thinking that
the Earth it &s;elf &s;uffer'd &s;ome Convul&s;ion; and
that for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e &s;everal Springs,
for the &s;pace of 48 Hours afterwards, were ve|ry
muddy, which were never known to be &s;o
by any Storm of Wind or Rain before: nor in|deed
is it po&s;&s;ible, they lying &s;o low, could be
affected by any thing le&s;s than a Concu&s;&s;ion of
the Earth it &s;elf.</P>

<P>THis comes to let you know that I recei|ved
yours in the <HI>Downs,</HI> for which I thank
you. I expected to have &s;een you in <HI>London</HI>
before now, had we not met with a mo&s;t vio|lent
Storm in our way to <HI>Chatham.</HI> On the 27th
of the la&s;t Month, about Three of the Clock in

to Sea: about Six we lo&s;t our Rother, and were
left in a mo&s;t deplorable condition to the mer|cile&s;s
Rage of the Wind and Seas: we al&s;o &s;prung
a Leak, and drove 48 Hours expecting to pe|ri&s;h.
But it plea&s;ed God to give us a wonder|ful
Deliverance, &s;carce to be parallell'd in Hi&s;to|ry;
for about Midnight we were drove into
&s;houl Water, and &s;oon after our Ship &s;truck up|on
the Sands: the Sea broke over us, we expe|cted
every minute that &s;he would drop to pieces,

Pilot, or any Help but Almighty God's) into

order to &s;ave our Lives: but it has plea&s;ed God
al&s;o, far beyond our expectation, to &s;ave our
Ship, and bring us &s;afe off again la&s;t Night.
We &s;hall remain here a con&s;iderable while to re|fit
our Ship, and get a new Rother. Our De|liverance
is mo&s;t remarkable, that in the mid|dle

without knowing where we were, drive into a

thankful, and never forget &s;o great a mercy.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to the publick Notice, I &s;end
you two or three Ob&s;ervations of mine
upon the late dreadful Tempe&s;t: As,</P>
<P>1. In the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Mary Cray, Kent,</HI> a
poor Man, with his Wife and Child, were but
ju&s;t gone out of their Bed, when the Head of
their Hou&s;e fell in upon it; which mu&s;t have
kill'd them.</P>
<P>2. A great long Stable in the Town, near the
Church, was blown off the Foundation entirely
at one &s;udden Bla&s;t, from the We&s;t-&s;ide to the
Ea&s;t, and ca&s;t out into the High-way, over the
Heads of five Hor&s;es, and a Carter feeding them
at the &s;ame time, and not one of them hurt, nor
the Rack or Manger touch'd, which are yet
&s;tanding to the Admiration of all Beholders.</P>
<P>3. As the Church at <HI>Heyes</HI> received great Da|mage,
&s;o the Spire, with one Bell in it, were
blown away over the Church-yard.</P>
<P>4. The Mini&s;ter of <HI>South-A&s;h</HI> had a great De|liverance
from a Chimney falling in upon his
<PB N="255" REF="270">
Bed ju&s;t as he ro&s;e, and hurt only his Feet; as
ble&s;&s;ed be God, our Lives have been all very
miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erv'd, tho' our Buildings every
where damag'd. You may depend on all, as
certify'd by me,</P>
<CLOSER><HI>Thomas Watts,</HI>
Vicar of <HI>Orpington</HI> and St. <HI>Mary Cray.</HI></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>There are an innumerable variety of Delive|rances,
be&s;ides the&s;e, which de&s;erve a Memori|al
to future Ages; but the&s;e are noted from the
Letters, and at the Reque&s;t of the Per&s;ons par|ticularly
concern'd.</P>
<P>Particularly, 'tis a mo&s;t remarkable Story of a
Man belonging to the <HI>Mary,</HI> a fourth Rate Man
of War, lo&s;t upon the <HI>Goodwin Sands;</HI> and all
the Ship's Company but him&s;elf being lo&s;t, he,
by the help of a piece of the broken Ship, got
a-board the <HI>Northumberland;</HI> but the Violence
of the Storm continuing, the <HI>Northumberland</HI>
ran the &s;ame fate with the <HI>Mary,</HI> and coming
on &s;hore upon the &s;ame Sand, was &s;plit to pieces
by the Violence of the Sea: and yet this Per&s;on,
by a &s;ingular Providence, was one of the 64
that were delivered by a <HI>Deal Hooker</HI> out of that
Ship, all the re&s;t peri&s;hing in the Sea.</P>
<P>A poor Sailor of <HI>Brighthelm&s;ton</HI> was taken up
after he had hung by his Hands and Feet on the
top of a Ma&s;t 48 hours, the Sea raging &s;o high,
that no Boat dur&s;t go near him.</P>
<P>A Hoy run on &s;hore on the Rocks in <HI>Milford</HI>
Haven, and ju&s;t &s;plitting to pieces (as by Cap|tain
<HI>Soam</HI>'s Letter) a Boat drove by, being
<PB N="256" REF="271">
broke from another Ve&s;&s;el, with no body in it,
and came &s;o near the Ve&s;&s;el, as that two Men
jumpt into it, and &s;av'd their Lives: the Boy
could not jump &s;o far, and was drowned.</P>
<P>Five Sailors &s;hifted three Ve&s;&s;els on an I&s;land
near the <HI>Humber,</HI> and were at la&s;t &s;av'd by a
Long-boat out of the fourth.</P>
<P>A Waterman in the River of <HI>Thames</HI> lying
a&s;leep in the Cabbin of a Barge, at or near
<HI>Black-Fryers,</HI> was driven thro' Bridge in the
Storm, and the Barge went of her &s;elf into the
<HI>Tower-Dock,</HI> and lay &s;afe on &s;hore; the Man
never wak'd, nor heard the Storm, till 'twas
Day; and, to his great&punc; A&s;toni&s;hment, he found
him&s;elf &s;afe as above.</P>
<P>Two Boys in the <HI>Poultry</HI> lodging in a Garret
or Upper-room, were, by the Fall of Chimneys,
which broke thro' the Floors, carried quite to
the bottom of the Cellar, and receiv'd no Da|mage
at all.</P>

to Norway.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot but write to you of the Particulars
of our &s;ad and terrible Voyage to this Place.
You know we were, by my la&s;t, riding &s;afe in
the <HI>Downs,</HI> waiting a fair Wind, to make the
be&s;t of our way to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and there to ex|pect
the <HI>Lisbon</HI> Convoy.</P>
<P>We had had two terrible Storms, o$e on the
<HI>Friday</HI> before, and one on <HI>Thur&s;day;</HI> the one the
18th, the other the 25th of <HI>November:</HI> In the
la&s;t I expected we &s;hou'd have $ounder'd at an
Anchor; for our Ground Tackle being new and
very good held us fa&s;t, but the Sea broke upon
us &s;o heavy and quick, that we were in danger
two or three times of Foundring as we rod:
but, as it pleas'd God we rid it ou$, we began
to think all was over, and the Bitterne&s;s of
Death was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>There was a great Fleet with us in the <HI>Downs,</HI>
and &s;everal of them were driven from their
Anchors, and made the be&s;t of their way out to
Sea for fear of going on &s;hore upon the <HI>Goodwin.</HI>
the Grand Fleet was ju&s;t come in from the
<HI>Streights,</HI> under Sir <HI>Clou$&s;$y Shovel;</HI> and the
Great Ships being de&s;ign'd for the River, lay to
<PB N="261" REF="276">
Leeward: Mo&s;t of the Ships that went out in
the Night appear'd in the Morning; and I
think there was none known to be lo&s;t, but one
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el upon the <HI>Goodwin.</HI></P>
<P>But the next Day, being <HI>Friday,</HI> in the Even|ing,
it began to gather to Windward; and as
it had blown very hard all Day, at Night the
Wind fre&s;hen'd, and we all expected a &s;tormy
Night. We &s;aw the Men of War &s;trcuk their
Top-ma&s;ts, and rode with two Cables an-end:
&s;o we made all as <HI>&s;nug</HI> as we could, and prepar'd
for the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>In this condition we rid it out till about 12 a-clock;
when, the Fury of the Wind encrea&s;ing,
we began to &s;ee De&s;truction before us: the Ob|jects
were very dreadful on every &s;ide; and tho'
it was very dark, we had Light enough to &s;ee
our own Danger, and the Danger of tho&s;e near
us. About One a-clock the Ships began to drive,
and we &s;aw &s;everal come by us without a Ma&s;t
&s;tanding, and in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>By Two a-clock we could hear Guns firing in
&s;everal Parts of this Road, as Signals of Di&s;tre&s;s;
and tho' the Noi&s;e was very great with the Sea
and Wind, yet we could di&s;tingui&s;h plainly, in
&s;ome &s;hort Intervals, the Cries of poor Souls in
Extremities.</P>
<P>By Four-a-clock we mi&s;s'd the <HI>Mary</HI> and the
<HI>Northumberland,</HI> who rid not far from us, and
found they were driven from their Anchors;
but what became of them, God knows: and
&s;oon after a large Man of War came driving
down upon us, all her Ma&s;ts gone, and in a
<PB N="262" REF="277">
dreadful Condition. We were in the utmo&s;t
De&s;pair at this &s;ight, for we &s;aw no avoiding
her coming thwart <HI>our Hai&s;er:</HI> &s;he drove at la&s;t
&s;o near us, that I was ju&s;t gowing to order the
Mate to cut away, when it pleas'd God the Ship
&s;heer'd contrary to our Expectation to Wind|ward,
and the Man of War, which we found
to be the <HI>Sterling Ca&s;tle,</HI> drove clear off us, not
two Ships Lengths to Leeward.</P>
<P>It was a Sight full of terrible Particulars, to
&s;ee a Ship of Eighty Guns and about Six Hun|dred
Men in that di&s;mal Ca&s;e; &s;he had cut a|way
all her Ma&s;ts, the Men were all in the
Confu&s;ions of Death and De&s;pair; &s;he had nei|ther
Anchor, nor Cable, nor Boat to help her;
the Sea breaking over her in a terrible Manner,
that &s;ometimes &s;he &s;eem'd all under Water; and
they knew, as well as we that &s;aw her, that
they drove by the Tempe&s;t directly for the
<HI>Goodwin,</HI> where they could expect nothing but
De&s;truction: The Cries of the Men, and the
firing their Guns, One by One, every Half Mi|nute
for Help, terrified us in &s;uch a Manner,
that I think we were half dead with the Horror
of it.</P>
<P>All this while we rid with two Anchors a-head,
and in great Di&s;tre&s;s: To fire Guns for Help,
I &s;aw was to no Purpo&s;e, for if any Help was
to be had, there were &s;o many other Objects
for it, that we could not expect it, and the Storm
&s;till encrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Two Ships, a-head of us, had rid it out till
now, which was towards Five in the Morning
<PB N="263" REF="278">
when they both drove from their Anchors, and
one of them coming foul of a &s;mall <HI>Pink,</HI> they
both &s;unk together; the other drove by us, and
having one Ma&s;t &s;tanding, I think it was her
Main-Ma&s;t, &s;he attempted to &s;pread a little
Peak of her Sail, and &s;o &s;tood away before it;
I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he went away to Sea.</P>
<P>At this time, the Raging of the Sea was &s;o
violent, and the Tempe&s;t doubled its Fury in &s;uch
a Manner, that my Mate told me, we had better
go away to Sea, for 'twould be impo&s;&s;ible to ride
it out; I was not of his Opinion, but was for
cutting my Ma&s;ts by the Board, which at la&s;t
we did, and parted with them with as little
Damage as could be expected, and we thought
&s;he rid ea&s;ier for it by a great deal; and I believe,
had it blown two Hours longer, we &s;hould
have rid it out, having two new Cables out,
and our be&s;t Bower and Sheet Anchor down:
But about Half an Hour after Five to Six, it blew,
if it be po&s;&s;ible to conceive it &s;o, as hard again as
it had done before, and fir&s;t our be&s;t Bower An|chor
came Home, the Mate, who felt it give
way, cried out, we are all undone, for the Ship
drove; I found it too true, and, upon as &s;hort a
Con&s;ultation as the Time would admit, we con|cluded
to put out to Sea before we were driven
too far to Leward, when it would be impo&s;&s;ible
to avoid the <HI>Goodwin.</HI></P>
<P>So vve &s;lipt our Sheet Cable, and &s;heering
the Ship tovvards the Shore, got her Head about,
and &s;tood avvay afore it; Sail vve had none, nor
Ma&s;t &s;tanding: Our Mate had &s;et up a Jury
<PB N="264" REF="279">
Mi&s;&s;en but no Canva&s;s could bear the Fury of
the Wind, yet he fa&s;ten'd an old Tarpaulin &s;o
as that it did the Office of a Mi&s;&s;en and kept us
from driving too fa&s;t to Leeward.</P>
<P>In this Condition we drove out of the <HI>Downs,</HI>
and pa&s;t &s;o near the <HI>Goodwin,</HI> that we could &s;ee
&s;everal great Ships fa&s;t a ground, and beating to
Pieces. We drove in this de&s;perate Condition
till Day-break, without any Abatement of the
Storm, and our Men heartle&s;s and di&s;pirited,
$ir'd with the Service of the Night, and every
Minute expecting Death.</P>
<P>About 8 a Clock, my Mate told me, he perceiv'd
the Wind to abate; but it blew &s;till &s;uch a Storm,
that if we had not had a very tite Ship, &s;he mu&s;t
have founder'd, as we were now farther off at
Sea, and by my Gue&s;s might be in the mid Way
between <HI>Harwi$h</HI> and the <HI>Brill,</HI> the Sea we
$ound run longer, and did not break &s;o quick
upon us as before, but it ran exceeding high,
and we having no Sail to keep us to rights, we lay
wallowing in the Trough of the Sea in a mi&s;e|rable
Condition: We &s;aw &s;everal Ships in the
&s;ame Condition with our &s;elves, but could nei|ther
help them, nor they us; and one we
&s;aw founder before our Eyes, and all the Peo|ple
peri&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Another di&s;mal Object we met with, which
was an open Boat full of Men, who, as we may
&s;uppo&s;e, had lo&s;t their Ship; any Man may &s;up|po&s;e,
what Condition a Boat mu&s;t be in, if we
were in &s;o bad a Ca&s;e in a good Ship: we were
&s;oon to&s;t out of their Sight, and what became
<PB N="265" REF="280">
of them any one may gue&s;s; if they had been
within Cables Length of us we could not have
help'd them.</P>
<P>About Two a Clock in the Afternoon, the
Wind encrea&s;ed again, and we made no
doubt it would prove as bad a Night as be|fore;
but that Gu&s;t held not above Half an
Hour.</P>
<P>All Night it blew exce&s;&s;ive hard, and the next
Day, which was Sabbath Day, about Eleven a
Clock it abated, but &s;till blew hard: about three
it blew &s;omething moderately, compar'd with
the former; and we got up a Jury$Main-Ma&s;t,
and rigg'd it as well as we could, and with a
Main Sail lower'd almo&s;t to the Deck, &s;tood at
a great Rate afore it all Night and the next Day,
and on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Morning we &s;aw Land, but could
not tell where it was; but being not in a Condi|on
to keep the Sea, we run in, and made Signals
of Di&s;tre&s;s; &s;ome Pilots came off to us, by whom
we were inform'd we had reached the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Norway,</HI> and having neither Anchor nor Cable
on board capable to ride the Ship, a <HI>Norweigian</HI>
Pilot came on board, and brought us into a
Creek where we had &s;mooth Water, and lay by
till we got Help, Cables, and Anchors, by which
means we are &s;afe in Place.</P>

<HEAD>From on board the John aud Mary, riding in Yar|mouth
Roads duriug the great Storm, but now
in the River of Thames.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEaring of your good De&s;ign of pre&s;erving
the Memory of the late Dreadful Storm
for the Benefit of Po&s;terity, I cannot let you
want the Particulars as happen'd to us on board
our Ship.</P>
<P>We came over the Bar of <HI>Tinmouth</HI> about the
having had terrible blowing Weather
for almo&s;t a Week, in&s;omuch that we were twice
driven back almo&s;t the Length of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> with
much Difficulty and Danger we got well over
that, and made the <HI>High-land</HI> about <HI>Cromer</HI> on
the North-&s;ide of <HI>Norfolk;</HI> here it blew &s;o hard
the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Night before, that we could not
keep the Sea, nor fetch the Roads of <HI>Yarmouth;</HI>
but as the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norfolk</HI> was a Weather-&s;hore,
we hall'd as clo&s;e <HI>Cromer</HI> as we dur&s;t lie, the
Shore there being very flat; here we rode <HI>Wed|ne&s;day</HI>
and <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> the 24th and 25th of <HI>No|vember.</HI></P>
<P>We
could not reckon our &s;elves &s;afe here, for as
this is the mo&s;t dangerous Place between <HI>London</HI>
and <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and has been particularly fatal to
our Colliers, &s;o we were very unea&s;y: I con&s;i|dered
that when &s;uch Tempe&s;tuous Weather
happen'd, as this &s;eem'd to threaten, nothing is
more frequent than for the Wind to &s;hift Points;
<PB N="267" REF="282">
and if it &s;hould have blown half the Wind from
the South Ea&s;t, as now blew from the South
We&s;t, we mu&s;t have gone a-&s;hore there, and
been all lo&s;t for being embayed; there we &s;hould
have had no putting out to Sea, nor &s;taying
there.</P>
<P>This Con&s;ideration made me re&s;olve to be
gon, and thinking on <HI>Friday</HI> Morning the Wind
&s;lacken'd a little, I weigh'd and &s;tood away for
<HI>Yarmouth</HI> Roads; and with great Boating and
Labour got into the Roads about One in the Af|ternoon,
being a little after Flood, we found a
very great Fleet in the Roads; there was above
Three Hundred Sail of Colliers, not reckoning
above Thirty Sail which I left behind me, that
rode it out thereabouts, and there was a great
Fleet ju&s;t come from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> under the Convoy
of the <HI>Re&s;erve</HI> Frigate, and Two other Men of
War; and about a Hundred Sail of Coa&s;ters,
<HI>Hull</HI>-Men, and &s;uch &s;mall Craft.</P>
<P>We had not got to an Anchor, moor'd, and
&s;et all to Rights, but I found the Wind fre&s;hen'd,
the Clouds gather'd, and all look'd very black
to Windward; and my Mate told me, he
wi&s;h'd he had &s;taid where we were, for he
would warrant it we had a blowing Night
of it.</P>
<P>We did what we could to prepare for it,
&s;truck our Top-ma&s;t, and &s;lung our Yards, made
all tite and fa&s;t upon Deck; the Night prov'd
very dark, and the Wind blew a Storm about
Eight a Clock, and held till Ten, when we
thought it abated a little, but at Eleven it
<PB N="268" REF="283">
fre&s;hen'd again, and blew very hard; we rid it
out very well till Twelve, when we veer'd out
more Cable, and in about Half an Hour after,
the Wind encrea&s;ing, let go our Sheet Anchor;
by One a Clock it blew a dreadful Storm, and
though our Anchors held very well, the Sea
came over us in &s;uch a va&s;t Quantity, that we
was every Hour in Danger of Foundring: About
Two a Clock the Sea fill'd our Boat as &s;he lay
upon the Deck, and we was glad to let her go
over board for Fear of &s;taving in our Decks: Our
Mate would then have cut our Ma&s;t by the
Board, but I was not willing, and told him, I
thought we had better &s;lip our Cables, and go
out to Sea, he argued &s;he was a deep Ship, and
would not live in the Sea, and was very eager
for cutting away the Ma&s;t; but I was loth to
part with my Ma&s;t, and could not tell where to
run for Shelter if I lo&s;t them.</P>
<P>About Three a Clock abundance of Ships
drove away, and came by us; &s;ome with all their
Ma&s;ts gone, and foul of one another; in a &s;ad
Condition my Men &s;aid they &s;aw Two founder'd
together, but I was in the Cabin, and cannot
&s;ay I &s;aw it. I &s;aw a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Ship come foul of a
Collier, and both drove away together out of
our Sight, but I am told &s;ince the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Man
&s;unk by her Side.</P>
<P>In this Condition we rid till about Three a
Clock, the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> Ships which lay a-head of me,
and the Men of War, who lay a-head of them,
fir'd their Guns for Help, but 'twas in vain to
expect it; the Sea went too high for any Boat
<PB N="269" REF="284">
to live. About Five, the Wind blew at that
prodigious Rate, that there was no Po&s;&s;ibility
of riding it out, and all the Ships in the Road
&s;eem'd to us to drive: Yet &s;till our Anchors
held it, and I began to think we &s;hould ride it
out there, or founder; when a Ship's long Boat
came driving again&s;t us, and gave &s;uch a Shock
on the Bow that I thougbt it mu&s;t have been a
Ship come foul of us, and expected to &s;ink all at
once; our Men &s;aid there was &s;ome People in the
Boat, but as the Sea went &s;o high no man du&s;t
&s;tand upon the Fore-ca&s;tle, &s;o no Body could be
&s;ure of it; the Boat &s;tav'd to pieces with the
Blow, and went away, &s;ome on One Side of us
and &s;ome on the other; but whether our Cable
receiv'd any Damage by it or not we cannot
tell, but our Sheet Cable gave Way immediate|ly,
and as the other was not able to hold us a|lone,
we immediately drove; we had then no
more to do, but to put afore the Wind,
which we did: it plea&s;ed God by this Time the
Tide of Ebb was begun, which &s;omething aba|ted
the Height of the Sea, but &s;till it went ex|ceeding
high; we &s;aw a great many Ships in the
&s;ame Condition with our &s;elves, and expecting
every Moment to &s;ink in the Sea. In this Ex|tremity
we drove till Day light when we found
the Wind abated, and we &s;tood in for the Shore,
and coming under the Lee of the <HI>Cliff</HI> near
<HI>Scarbro,</HI> we got &s;o much Shelter, as that our
&s;mall Bower Anchors would ride us.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="285">
I can give you no Account but this; but &s;ure
&s;uch a Tempe&s;t never was in the World. They
&s;ay here, that of Eighty Sail in <HI>Grimsby</HI> Road,
they can hear of but Sixteen; yet the re&s;t are all
blown away, Here is about Twelve or Four|teen
Sail of Ships come in to this Place, and
more are &s;tanding in for the Shore.</P>

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor of this Book has labour'd un|der
&s;ome Difficulties in this Account:
and one of the chief has been, how to avoid too
many Particulars, the Crowds of Relations which
he has been oblig'd to lay by to bring the Story
into a Compa&s;s tolerable to the Reader.</P>
<P>And tho' &s;ome of the Letters in&s;erted are
written in a homely Stile, and expre&s;t after the
Country Fa&s;hion from whence they came, the
Author cho&s;e to make them &s;peak their own
Language, rather than by dre&s;&s;ing them in other
Words make the Authors forget they were their
own.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="286">
We receiv'd a Letter, very particular, rela|ting
to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> and refle|cting
upon his Lord&s;hip for &s;ome Words he
&s;poke, <HI>That he had rather have his Brains knock'd
out, than</HI> &amp;c. relating to his Inferiour Clergy.
The Gentleman takes the Di&s;a&s;ter for a Judg|ment
of God on him: But as in his Letter the
Per&s;on owns him&s;elf the Bi&s;hop's Enemy, fills
his Letter with &s;ome Reflexions indecent, at
lea&s;t for us: and at la&s;t, tho' he dates from <HI>So|merton,</HI>
yet baulks &s;etting his Name to his Let|ter:
for the&s;e Rea&s;ons we could not &s;atisfie to
record the Matter, and leave a Charge on the
Name of that unfortunate Gentleman, which,
he being dead, could not an&s;wer, and we alive
could not prove. And on the&s;e Accounts hope
the Reverend Gentleman who &s;ent the Letter
will excu&s;e Us.</P>
<P>Al&s;o we have omitted, tho' our Li&s;t of Parti|culars
promis'd &s;uch a thing, An Account of
&s;ome unthinking Wretches, who pa&s;s'd over this
dreadful Judgment with Banter, Scoffing, and
Contempt. 'Tis a Subject ungrateful to recite,
and full of Horror to read; and we had much
rather cover &s;uch Actions with a general Blank
in Charity to the Offenders, and in hopes of their
Amendment.</P>
<P>One unhappy Accident I cannot omit, and
which is brought us from good Hands, and hap|pen'd
in a Ship homeward bound from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI>
The Ship was in the utmo&s;t Danger of
Foundring; and when the Ma&s;ter &s;aw all, as
he thought, lo&s;t, his Ma&s;ts gone, the Ship leaky,
<PB N="272" REF="287">
and expecting her every moment to &s;ink under
him, fill'd with De&s;pair, he calls to him the
Surgeon of the Ship, and by a fatal Contract, as
&s;oon made as ha&s;tily executed, they re&s;olv'd to
prevent the Death they fear'd by one more cer|tain;
and going into the Cabbin, they both
&s;hot them&s;elves with their Pi&s;tols. It pleas'd
God the Ship recover'd the Di&s;tre&s;s, was driven
&s;afe into&mdash;and the Captain ju&s;t liv'd to
&s;ee the de&s;perate Cour&s;e he took might have
been &s;par'd; the Surgeon died immediately.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal very remarkable Ca&s;es come
to our Hands &s;ince the fini&s;hing this Book, and
&s;everal have been promis'd which are not come
in; and the Book having been &s;o long promis'd,
and &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd by &s;everal Gentlemen
that have already a&s;&s;i&s;ted that way, the Under|takers
could not prevail with them&s;elves to de|lay
it any longer.</P>
