<HEAD>MINUTE S OF THE NEGOTIATION OF <HI>Mon&s;ieur Me&s;nager,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_PUrpo&s;ing here to write for private Remembrance, Memorials of &s;ome par|ticular Secret Negotiati|ons, which I have been employed in by the King's Command for &s;ome Years pa&s;t; I de&s;ign not to form it as an Hi&s;tory of my Life, which was led in a more private Capa|city, or to put it into &s;uch Shape as to appear publickly in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
AS I was for many Years Honoured with being employed among Per&s;ons of Figure, in Things appertaining to the Admini&s;tration of State-Affairs, during the Reign of the late King, of glorious Memory; but more par|ticularly tho&s;e for univer&s;al <HI>Commerce;</HI> IT gave me Acquaintance with the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Europe</HI> in general; and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and furtherance of my Friends, gave me many Oppor|tunities <HI>to be known to the King;</HI> and as his Maje&s;ty had the Goodne&s;s on &s;everal Occa&s;ions to &s;ay &s;ome things in my Favour, it fired me with a Zeal for his Service, and that commenda|ble Ambition of rendering my &s;elf u&s;e|ful in the Intere&s;t of my Country.</P>
<P>It was not a little my good Fortune, that I came frequently before the King with &s;uch Papers and Writings, as having been furni&s;hed by His Ma|je&s;ty's Directions, required to be Sign|ed by his own Hand; for by this means the King took more notice of me than u&s;ual; and as his more &s;e|cret Services &s;ometimes required Per|&s;ons particularly nominated by the Secretaries to be employed, I found that two or three Times his Maje&s;ty
<PB N="5" REF="4">
called for me, to draw up &s;ome Schemes of publick Affairs, which He had di|ge&s;ted in his own Thoughts; and which He was more capable of, than any Prince in the World; and as his Maje&s;ty, in my reading them to Him, would &s;top &s;ometimes, and mu&s;e upon the Manner in which things were worded, He would &s;ome|times &s;ay, <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> might be bet|ter expre&s;s'd, and cau&s;e it to be al|tered as He him&s;elf was plea&s;ed to di|ctate; and &s;ometimes would ask if it were not better <HI>&s;o</HI> or <HI>&s;o,</HI> and ob|lige me to give my Judgment; in which I had often the good Fortune to have my Opinion plea&s;e Him bet|ter than his own.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things made me attend often upon the King, and at length brought <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI> to call for me, upon Occa&s;ions far diffe|rent from the common Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Office; as particularly, about the Year 1706, the King having him&s;elf formed a Scheme for &s;ome Attempts upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> He called me frequently to Him to draw it up in Form: When it was, after &s;everal Alterations, brought to plea&s;e Him, He told me, He was ex|tremely
<PB N="6" REF="5">
fond of that De&s;ign, and ask|ed me if I was willing to go to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> with it? I made his Maje&s;ty &s;en&s;ible what an Honour I &s;hould e&s;teem it, to be &s;ent to any Part of the World where his Service required: <HI>I think,</HI> &s;ays the King, <HI>no Body is &s;o able to tell my Grand&s;on, the King of</HI> Spain, <HI>my Thoughts in all the Particulars, as you who have &s;een all the Alterations, Amendments, and Additions we have made, and known the Ground|plot of the whole.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly I went to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and laid the Scheme before the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> but when He came to have it di&s;cour&s;ed in his Council of State, they were &s;o backward, &s;o ignorant, conceived &s;o ill of the De&s;ign, and rai&s;ed &s;o many Difficulties, that I was obliged to &s;end his Maje&s;ty Word, I thought the <HI>Spani&s;h Court</HI> capable of doing nothing for them&s;elves. The King was exceedingly vexed that his Propo&s;als were not received with &s;o much readine&s;s as was expected, and called me home again, which I was very well plea&s;ed with; nothing be|ing more di&s;agreeable to any Man, who has liv'd in <HI>France,</HI> and e&s;peci|ally at Court, than that &s;tiff, haugh|ty,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
unconcerned Way, that the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> do all their Bu&s;ine&s;s with.</P>
<P>This Project was in &s;hort thus: The King propo&s;ed to &s;end 14 Men of War of the Line, to the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> to attack the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony of <HI>Jamaica:</HI> His Maje&s;ty's Mea&s;ures were, that the Ships &s;hould Rendezvous at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> there to take in Provi&s;ions, and as many <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Seamen as could be had there; from thence to proceed to the <HI>Havana.</HI> This the King ordered, becau&s;e it would amu&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who would not imagine that the De&s;ign was &s;o far out of the Way. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> made a Diffi|culty of every thing; they &s;pent 3 Weeks in getting over the Method to prevent the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants go|ing to <HI>America</HI> in our Ships without Licen&s;e, and would have had me gone back to <HI>Paris</HI> for the King's Hand, to an Engagement, that the <HI>French</HI> Ships &s;hould carry no <HI>European</HI> Mer|chandizes with them; nay, they would have had the King's Men of War &s;ubmitted to be vi&s;ited by the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers. Then they &s;crupled admitting the Men of War into the Port of <HI>Havana,</HI> for fear, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e,</HI> of Seizing it for the King of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>France;</HI> as if when the King had gi|ven the King of <HI>Spain</HI> a Kingdom, He would have attempted to take &s;ome of it again from him.</P>
<P>Tired with this impertinent Slow|ne&s;s in their Proceedings, and with the unperforming Temper of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> the King, as I &s;aid, gave over the be&s;t De&s;ign that was ever laid of that kind, and which could not have failed to have an&s;wered the End, had no uncommon Di&s;a&s;ter befallen it from the Elements; for as for the Enemies, there was no fear of any Preparations they could make for it; becau&s;e there was no po&s;&s;ibility of their having any notice of it.</P>
<P>The Ships, as I have &s;aid, were to have their Rendezvous at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and were to have Six Thou&s;and Men on Board of Regular Troops, to whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were to join Two Thou|&s;and, with Twenty Tran&s;ports; and the Rendezvous being at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> they were to Sail from thence to the <HI>Ha|vana,</HI> becau&s;e it was his Maje&s;ty's O|pinion if they went to <HI>Martinico,</HI> or St. <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI>'s, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would have notice of them, and would immedi|ately
<PB N="9" REF="8">
arm on all Hands, and be ready to oppo&s;e them; but as the <HI>Havana</HI> was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Port, between which and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> I&s;lands, there was no occa&s;ion of Intelligence; it was the King's opinion, that it was ea&s;ie for the Fleet to lie there, and be joined by the other Ships which &s;hould come from <HI>Martinico,</HI> &amp;c. and the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> to have no knowledge of it, which was indeed very rea&s;onable: The King's Orders were then, that they &s;hould &s;end an Expre&s;s to the &s;aid Colonies at <HI>Martinico,</HI> to join them with all the armed Sloops, or other Ships they had, and in a Word, with all the Force they could rai&s;e, which, <HI>as the King &s;aid,</HI> He expected &s;hould be near 4000 Men more, with Ships and Sloops enough to car|ry them; without reckoning 3 Men of War which were there already; and as the King ob&s;erved, He was &s;atisfied, that the <HI>Four Thou&s;and</HI> Men from <HI>Martinico</HI> and St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> would be much fitter for Service, than the <HI>Six Thou&s;and</HI> from <HI>Europe,</HI> for of them, his Maje&s;ty &s;aid, He &s;hould always expect one Half to be Sick.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
<HI>With this Force,</HI> the King's Mea&s;ures were, that they &s;hould Sail from the <HI>Havana</HI> directly to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and come to an Anchor in the Road; from whence they were to alarm all the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> I&s;lands, and by making Preparations to land, they &s;hould at lea&s;t prevent that any Force &s;hould be &s;ent from thence to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where the main De&s;ign was to land; after &s;ome time, the whole Army and half the Men of War &s;hould &s;ail to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which is all with a Trade Wind, and Sea Current, leaving 7 or 8 Men of War at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> to keep them alarm'd; that there the Forces &s;hould go directly on Shore, and attack the Forts at the <HI>Point,</HI> which there was no doubt, after a &s;hort Battery, they would take Sword in Hand; after which, the whole I|&s;land would be reduced of Cour&s;e; be&s;ides the Booty in Merchandizes and Negroes, which would be im|men&s;e.</P>
<P>The King was &s;o wrapt up in this Project, that it was no wonder if He was very much di&s;plea&s;ed at the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> that they had not an equal
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Pa&s;&s;ion for it, when it was propo&s;ed by me; and when I brought his Ma|je&s;ty an Account of their Behaviour, He &s;aid, <HI>They are the mo&s;t &s;tupid Wi&s;e People in the World:</HI> However, the King did not lay a&s;ide his Project, though He left out the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Execution; and though He chang|ed the Nature of the Attempt, and the Scene of Action, which was re|moved to <HI>Nevis,</HI> and <HI>Antegoa:</HI> There the Enterpri&s;e was &s;ome time after carried on with good Succe&s;s; and our Admiral landed, de&s;troyed the former entirely, and plundered the latter; and be&s;ides the other Booty made, and the Spoil done to the E|nemy, our Men took as many Ne|groes from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as they &s;old afterwards to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for 400000 Pieces of Eight. <HI>But this by the Way.</HI></P>
<P>The King had now for many Years been embark'd in a heavy War with almo&s;t all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> in De|fence of his great Grand&s;on King <HI>Phi|lip</HI>'s Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> and though he had happily &s;ucceeded; in the fir&s;t Part, by the good Con|duct of that perfect Politician, the Duke <HI>de Harcourt,</HI> and had brought
<PB N="12" REF="11">
not only the late King of <HI>Spain</HI> to concede the Crown by Te&s;tament, to the then Duke <HI>de Anjou</HI> at his Death; but had quietly placed him on the &s;aid Throne. Yet his Maje&s;ty found in&s;uperable Difficulties in the Pro&s;e|cution of the War, which that Affair was nece&s;&s;arily attended with; and <HI>which was wor&s;e,</HI> Fortune, contrary to her long u&s;age, had faced about to His Maje&s;ty's Enemies, and that to &s;uch a Degree, That in the Space of Two Years, his Forces &s;u&s;tained three &s;uch Shocks, or his Enemies gained three &s;uch terrible Victories, as would have been &s;ufficient to have over|thrown, even the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> it &s;elf, in the Time of its mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The&s;e Advantages not only made the entering upon Mea&s;ures for a Treaty of Peace more nece&s;&s;ary to His Maje&s;ty than before, but more difficult al&s;o; as the Enemy became thereby the more Haughty and un|tractable; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> General the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;was then newly made more Haughty than before, by the Complement, <HI>for it was little more,</HI> which was made him by
<PB N="13" REF="12">
the Emperor, of creating him a Prince of the Empire, by the Title of <HI>Mindleheim,</HI> a little Principality in the Claim of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and which that General could not be ignorant, <HI>though perhaps the Title put that Circum&s;tance from his Head,</HI> mu&s;t be rendred again at a Peace, when|ever it &s;hould come to be treated of again.</P>
<P>Some have &s;aid, that the World ought to have &s;een that the <HI>Duke of M</HI>&mdash;had &s;ome Thoughts that this War was not to be ended at all by Treaty, but by Conque&s;t, and that otherwi&s;e he could not have accepted an Honour &s;o Temporary, as was &s;ure to expire at a Peace; But it would be as much too gro&s;s for us to imagine, that he did not fore&s;ee the latter, as it would, that he &s;hould be &s;o weak to flatter him&s;elf with the former.</P>
<P>However it was, that Prince, <HI>for &s;o I mu&s;t call him,</HI> had &s;uch an a&s;cen|dant now over the Princes and States of the Confederacy, and who were at that time called, the <HI>Grand Alliance,</HI> that itwas to no more Purpo&s;e to think of offering Conditions of Peace
<PB N="14" REF="13">
to any, but through his interpo&s;ition, than it was to make any Offers to him, who &s;eem'd re&s;olved to put no end to the War, but by the Conque&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The King, who &s;aw with other Eyes than mo&s;t Men, and who &s;ome|times knew the Tempers and Chara|cters both of Men and Nations of Men, better than they knew their own; was always po&s;itive in this, that a Treaty &s;hould commence with|out any Application to the <HI>Duke of M</HI>&mdash;: It was &s;trange to &s;ee all his great Men of a contrary Opi|nion, in&s;omuch, that one of them took upon him to &s;ay to the King, that it was impo&s;&s;ible; <HI>The King &s;miled, and &s;aid nothing;</HI> but it was ea&s;ie for a Man of any penetration to know it &s;ignified both Anger and Contempt; and the &s;ame Per&s;on, though of the fir&s;t Rank, had the Mortification &s;oon after to under&s;tand it better, when &s;peaking in common Di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ome|thing very ea&s;ie to be done, but which he thought difficult, <HI>Ouy,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>il et impo&s;&s;ible comme,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;It is as <HI>impo&s;&s;ible as treating without the Prince of Mindleheim;</HI> after this, no
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Man offered to &s;ay there could be no Treaty without the <HI>Duke of M</HI>&mdash;But every one wondred which Way &s;uch a thing could be brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>It was a little while after this, that, attending on <HI>the King</HI> upon &s;ome com|mon Occa&s;ion, his Maje&s;ty called me to him, <HI>Be here,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>at</HI> 5 <HI>a Clock, I mu&s;t &s;et on Foot this impo&s;&s;ible Negotiation;</HI> I bowed, and attended at the Time; and <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI> hav|ing &s;ent to &s;ee if I was in the Anti-chamber, I was no &s;ooner come in, but one of the Bed-chamber &s;aid to me, <HI>You are too happy, Sir;</HI> while we <HI>wait here all Day, and all Night, you are asked for before you come.</HI> I under&s;tood his meaning, and finding Means to let His Maje&s;ty know I was attend|ing, I was immediately led into the King's Clo&s;et; <HI>Come,</HI> &s;ays the King, <HI>I'll &s;hew you how ea&s;ie the&s;e impo&s;&s;ible Things are to be done. I &s;ee I mu&s;t do every thing my &s;elf.</HI> I was going to &s;peak, when the King putting into my Hand a Paper, <HI>Read that over,</HI> &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, <HI>and tell me your Opinion of tho&s;e impo&s;&s;ible Things;</HI> the Sub&s;tance of the&s;e Papers contained &s;everal Rea|&s;onings
<PB N="16" REF="15">
upon the Means to bring the Allies to hearken to a Treaty of PEACE, and how to extricate the <HI>French</HI> Nation from &s;o dangerous a War, and &s;everal Heads of Propo&s;als, as the Plan of a Treaty: When I had read them all over, the King asked me what I thought of them; I told his Maje&s;ty, <HI>I thought it would be a harder Matter to bring the Allies to en|ter into a Treaty at all, than to lay down a Plan to be treated on, or to make Pro|po&s;als for the Ground-work of a Treaty,</HI> and reminded his Maje&s;ty of the Re|pul&s;e they had given to the Offer made by the <HI>Elector of Bavaria</HI> Two Years ago: <HI>You are right,</HI> &s;aid the King; <HI>but I have thought of a Method for that too.</HI> I bowed, and return'd, <HI>your Ma|je&s;ty is the Soul of all your Councils, none can pretend to give Mea&s;ures like your &s;elf:</HI> Says the King, <HI>I mu&s;t have a tru&s;ty Per&s;on at the</HI> Hague; <HI>an able Man never wants In&s;truments; I think you &s;hall be the Man,</HI> Me&s;nager, <HI>What &s;ay you? the Thought ju&s;t now occurs to me;</HI> here the King paus'd as if He had expected my An&s;wer, and after a little, He turn'd &s;hort on me, <HI>Does your Heart fail you?</HI> &s;ays his Maje&s;ty&punc;
<PB N="17" REF="16">
I was a little &s;urprized, for I had no|thing but Joy in my Thoughts on the Motion. <HI>Not to attempt any thing, SIR,</HI> returned I, <HI>that your Maje&s;ty Commands, only doubtful of my Ability: I'll take the Hazard of that,</HI> &s;ays the King: <HI>Get your &s;elf ready, and &s;ee me here to Mor|row after Ve&s;pers.</HI> I attended accord|ingly, and the King had ready his In|&s;tructions written with his own Hand; they were the &s;horte&s;t that ever any Agent received on a Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch Importance, and contained no more than this:</P>
<LG>
<L>'Place your &s;elf at the <HI>Hague</HI> in|cognito.</L>
<L>'Acquaint your &s;elf with Per&s;ons 'as you &s;ee occa&s;ion.</L>
<L>'Corre&s;pond with no Body but 'my Self.</L>
<L>'You know your Bu&s;ine&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<P>I arrived at the <HI>Hague</HI> in 5 Days; took Lodgings in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ome time as an <HI>Hun|garian,</HI> belonging to the Prince&s;s <HI>Ra|gotski;</HI> here I made an Acquaintance or two, by whom I had &s;ome Intel|ligence of the real Cau&s;es why the Treaty of Peace was &s;o oppo&s;ed by
<PB N="18" REF="17">
every &s;ide, while indeed every one was willing enough to have entertain|ed it, could they have made their private Advantages in the Treaty: This was that they were &s;o jealous of one another for; every one know|ing the Readine&s;s of <HI>France</HI> to make a Propo&s;al; that they kept Spies up|on one another in every Court, to watch, if &s;o much as a new Face did but appear: As the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had fre|quently expre&s;s'd their unea&s;ine&s;s on that Account; &s;o had the <HI>Dutch</HI> al|ternately to them; and it was not without great Menage, that an Un|der&s;tanding was pre&s;erved between them.</P>
<P>This Jealou&s;ie made it next to im|po&s;&s;ible for us to make any private Propo&s;al, and as impo&s;&s;ible to have any publick Propo&s;al accepted; <HI>for Example,</HI> when it was offered in the Year 1706, by private Negotiations, it tended only to have the Parties fall upon one another with Jealou&s;ies and Reproaches, and then purge them|&s;elves again, by &s;atisfying one another reciprocally, at the Expence of our Ma&s;ter; this they gave for a Rea&s;on to one another why, when the Duke
<PB N="19" REF="18">
of <HI>Bav$ria,</HI> by his Maje&s;ty's Command, wrote to the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> and at the &s;ame time to the States Deputies, to invite them to a Treaty, they would not give &s;o much as the Civility of an An&s;wer to his Electo|ral Highne&s;s's Letter, till they fir&s;t communicated the &s;aid Letter to each other.</P>
<P>This mutual Jealou&s;ie of the Allies, as it was no Te&s;timony that either had any opinion of the others Hone|&s;ty, &s;o it was well known from whence it proceeded, e&s;pecially on the Part of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which Piece of Secret Hi&s;tory is well worthy to be remembred.</P>
<P>The <HI>High Trea&s;urer</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the &s;ame we call <HI>Superintendant de Fi|nances,</HI> had long complain'd to the States General, of their Deficiency in Paying their Proportions of extraordi|nary Expences for the general Service of the War; particularly, &s;uch as Pro|vi&s;ions and Tran&s;ports for their Forces <HI>in Spain,</HI> where they carried on their Affairs heavily, and at an exorbitant Expence, which extended far beyond the Sums furni&s;hed by their Parlia|ment
<PB N="20" REF="19">
for tho&s;e Services. This in <HI>En|gland</HI> they called <HI>Exceedings;</HI> and being di&s;charged out of Money appointed for other Services, left the Trea&s;ury in Debt every Year; which, it &s;eems, he did not, <HI>as in Duty their Trea&s;urers are bound,</HI> lay Annually before their <HI>Par|liament,</HI> in order to have Provi&s;ion made for it; but left it on the gene|ral Credit of their Finances, to be provided for &s;ome time or other, he knew not when; and in the mean time was very importuning with the States for Payment of their &s;hare of tho&s;e Sums, and that even to &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, and warm Expre&s;&s;ions which pa&s;t between them; particularly the States being pre&s;s'd beyond mea|&s;ure for tho&s;e <HI>Exceedings,</HI> in regard to the War with <HI>Spain;</HI> an&s;wered flatly, that <HI>they did already expend &s;undry great Sums for the publick Good beyond what they thought their Quota; that if they were to be pre&s;s'd beyond their Ability, they mu&s;t put an end to the War upon the be&s;t Terms they could.</HI> This, as it will come to be mentioned again, I remark, becau&s;e <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI>&mdash;our A|gent for &s;ecret Service, then at <HI>Lon|don,</HI> often a&s;&s;ured me afterwards, that <HI>the Trea&s;urer</HI> complain'd in his Hear|ing,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> gave &s;uch An|&s;wers on all Occa&s;ions when he de|manded Ju&s;tice on tho&s;e Accounts; and that there was no Remedy, but <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t pay tho&s;e Sums, though it occa&s;ioned a great Arrear of Debts beyond the Appointments for the Service.</P>
<P>The&s;e were, it &s;eems, the Debts which afterward grew very Clamo|rous again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Trea&s;urer,</HI> and which, as we are told in <HI>France,</HI> were laid to the Charge of his Mi&s;ma|nagement, and was made u&s;e of to cau&s;e him to be di&s;placed from his Office. But this I know little of but by Report.</P>
<P>I found the Jealou&s;ie above&s;aid be|tween the Allies, made them, as I have ob&s;erved, very untractable; and it was long e're I brought my &s;elf to be in any Capacity to render the Service to the King which his Ma|je&s;ty expected; however, by long Re|&s;idence having gotten &s;ome Acquain|tance among the Foreign Mini&s;ters; I found <HI>Mon&s;ieur Pettecum,</HI> the Mini|&s;ter of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> a very penetrating Man; his Figure was too mean, to

that, <HI>for &s;ome Time,</HI> the Queen was very well &s;atisfied that &s;he ought to di&s;place them, and was even plea&s;ed with reflecting, how ju&s;t &s;he had been to her &s;elf, and to her People, in parting with them: tho' this Sa|tisfaction did not continue to the End of her Reign: <HI>But to return to the Character.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The Queen, <HI>as above,</HI> among her many good Qualities, was a very pa&s;&s;ionate Lover of the common People, as generally they were <HI>of her Maje&s;ty;</HI> and &s;he was not ea&s;ier to be deceived by any Pretences, than that of the <HI>Safety and Pro&s;perity</HI> of the People: <HI>In a Word,</HI> &s;he was an excellent Prince&s;s, and wanted no|thing to place her among the Ble&s;|&s;ed, but that &s;he &s;hould have been brought into the Bo&s;om of the <HI>Catho|lick</HI> Church, in which alone is dura|ble Felicity.</Q></P>
<P>I note the&s;e Particulars in the Cha|racter of this Prince&s;s, rather as a nece&s;&s;ary Introduction to what will happen in the Sequel of the&s;e Me|moirs, than that I can give a perfect Character of <HI>the Queen,</HI> to whom we

<P>This Temper of <HI>the Queen</HI> had &s;ome Share in the Changes which now were breaking out in her Court: The Party <HI>which aimed at the Admini&s;tration,</HI> had gotten Ground for &s;ome Time; partly thro' their own politick Management, and the Weakne&s;s of <HI>the Queen;</HI> and partly by &s;ome In&s;truments which they had the good Fortune to place near the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Per&s;on, by whom they failed not to in&s;inuate daily Things di&s;advantage|ous to the Mini&s;try then in Place; yet more e&s;pecially agreeable to the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Inclination; and this they did with &s;uch Application and Succe&s;s, that it &s;oon began to appear, that the Queen had not the &s;ame warm Side to the <HI>Whigs,</HI> which &s;he had before.</P>
<P><HI>It is nece&s;&s;ary to halt here,</HI> and go back to Per&s;ons, who I mu&s;t introduce, not into the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s only, but into her Confidence, for &s;ome Time before any Thing publick appeared; and by who&s;e Arts the <HI>Queen</HI> was prevailed with, <HI>happily for us in</HI> France, to change her Notions of Things, and
<PB N="45" REF="44">
to quit her Engagements with the <HI>Whigs,</HI> who were our <HI>mortal Enemies:</HI> After which, I &s;hall the more ea&s;ily bring on the Part I had to act in the Things which followed, and how all the&s;e Things, <HI>Providence wi&s;ely working,</HI> con|curred to re&s;tore the Glory of our Glorious and Immortal <HI>LEWIS,</HI> and to &s;ave <HI>France</HI> from De&s;truction.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutche&s;s of M</HI>&mdash;was for &s;ome Years &s;o much the Favourite of the <HI>Queen,</HI> that <HI>&s;he was &s;aid to rule</HI> her who reigned: She was not only her neare&s;t Servant, but her Friend, her Companion, her Intimate; the Partner in all &s;he did, and in all &s;he enjoy'd; This Lady had, <HI>as mo&s;t Ladies have,</HI> a principal Ser|vant or Confident <HI>under her,</HI> who was in &s;ome Re&s;pects the &s;ame Favourite to the <HI>Dutche&s;s,</HI> that the <HI>Dutche&s;s</HI> was to the <HI>Queen;</HI> when I had an Account in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> how the <HI>Dutche&s;s</HI> introduced this <HI>Familiar</HI> into the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Chamber, and not only brought her to be known to her Maje&s;ty, but gave her particular Recommendation, prai&s;ing her for her Addre&s;s, her Fidelity, and con&s;tituting her, as it were, her Second, not only in the common Services, but even in the Confidences of her Mi&s;tre&s;s; I

could not refrain calling to Mind the Fate of the <HI>Queen Mother</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. who introduc|ed to the King her Son, her Favourite the <HI>Bi&s;hop of</HI> Lu&ccedil;on, <HI>afterwards the fa|mous Cardinal</HI> Richlieu; and who thence forwards in&s;inuating him&s;elf into the King's Favour upon his own Foot, be|came the Prime Mini&s;ter of that long Reign; but was no &s;ooner &s;o exalted, than he became the mo&s;t implacable Enemy and Per&s;ecutor of his Bene|factre&s;s, never cea&s;ing till he had ob|tained of the King, to bani&s;h her fir&s;t from his Pre&s;ence, and after from his Kingdoms; refu&s;ing either to give her the ju&s;t Dowry, which appertained to her as Queen; or to &s;uffer her to return to his Kingdoms, even to the Day of her Death.</P>
<P>In like Manner, <HI>this mean Per&s;on</HI> being thus &s;tept in, turn'd upon her Bene|factre&s;s: She failed not to be &s;oon laid hold of by a <HI>&s;ubtler Agent,</HI> of whom I am going to &s;peak, and by him to be made an In&s;trument to bring off the Queen from &s;everal Things, which the Per&s;ons then in the Admini&s;tration had in their De&s;ign, relating to the pub|lick Affairs; and here it was that they
<PB N="47" REF="46">
fir&s;t began to find that their Influence in Matters began to abate; That the Queen, who u&s;ed implicitly to give up in what Mea&s;ures were brought to her by the Hands of tho&s;e &s;he entru&s;ted, and to yield wholly to their Advice; began now to he&s;itate, to enquire into Particulars, to di&s;like, to decline giving her Con&s;ent, and the like; and one Time it was ob&s;erved, that when &s;ome Things were brought to her to &s;ign, relating to the carrying on the Prepara|tions for the next Year; her Maje&s;ty &s;igned, but was ob&s;erved to let fall &s;ome Tears; and taking a great Sigh &s;aid, LORD! <HI>When will this Spilling of Blood be at an End.</HI></P>
<P>NOTE, This I learned by Report, after my Coming to <HI>England,</HI> but I had it from &s;uch Per&s;ons of Honour, as merit to be believed; e&s;pecially the Things <HI>I afterwards &s;aw</HI> there con|curring &s;o evidently therewith: When Things began thus to di&s;cover them|&s;elves, it was not difficult to gue&s;s, <HI>who had been ploughing with their Heifer,</HI> (viz.) <HI>ROBERT HARLET</HI> E&s;q; a private Gentleman of <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Extract, but grown popular by his having been a con&s;tant Member of their low|er
<PB N="48" REF="47">
Hou&s;e of Parliament, where he had many Followers, and had been &s;everal Times Speaker; This Man had al&s;o, by the like Recommendation of the High Trea&s;urer to the Queen, been made <HI>Secretary of State;</HI> in which Po&s;t, it &s;carce is to be doubted, but that find|ing he had obtained upon the Queen, whether by meer good Fortune, or by I know not what <HI>Foible&s;s</HI> of the Queen's Judgment, too ea&s;ie to be impo&s;ed upon, or by a certain Addre&s;s peculiar to him|&s;elf, we that know &s;o little of that Nation can ill re&s;olve; I &s;ay, finding he had an Intere&s;t in the Queen, indepen|dent of the Trea&s;urer who brought him in, and who, at fir&s;t, was exceeding fond of him; He &s;oon played the &s;ame Game as the Female had attempted to do, and &s;et him&s;elf to ruin their Inte|re&s;t, who had brought him in.</P>
<P>Having mentioned this Per&s;on, who, as above, I rank as a private Gentle|man, but at my Coming, I found to be Prime Mini&s;ter in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court; I mu&s;t &s;top a little to &s;peak of him, who has made &s;o much Stir in the World, and who&s;e Fate is not yet deter|mined.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48">
He is a Per&s;on of real great Capaci|ties, general Knowledge, and polite Learning, a taking and very engaging Way of Conver&s;ation, and when one di&s;cour&s;es with him on indifferent Af|fairs, he &s;peaks mo&s;t readily and clearly to every Thing, having a va&s;t Memory, and a very happy Elocution; he is affa|ble and courteous, ea&s;y of Acce&s;s, and prevents all Ceremony by a Familiarity that is extremely obliging.</P>
<P>In publick Bu&s;ine&s;s only, he differs from him&s;elf; for there his Di&s;cour&s;e is always re&s;erved, communicating no|thing, and allowing none to know the whole Event of what they are em|ployed to do; his Exce&s;s of Caution makes Bu&s;ine&s;s hang on his Hands, and his Di&s;patches were thereby always both &s;low and imperfect; and it is &s;aid, he &s;carce ever &s;ent any Per&s;on abroad, though on Matters of the greate&s;t Im|portance, but that he left &s;ome of their Bu&s;ine&s;s to be &s;ent after them: The Fame of his Parts brought him in|to the greate&s;t Employments, but <HI>when he was in,</HI> it never failed to render him unea&s;ie to all that were either above or below him: He knew too much to take his Mea&s;ures from any Man, and
<PB N="50" REF="49">
it was &s;aid, that it was the harde&s;t Thing in the World for any Man to take Mea&s;ures from him; he has been thought by mo&s;t People to de&s;ign well in the main, but has taken &s;uch exotick Mea&s;ures to bring his good De&s;igns to pa&s;s, that his Good would be as fatal as other Peoples Evil; his being &s;o ab|&s;olute in his own Mea&s;ures, as to enter into no Freedoms with any, has been the Cau&s;e that he has broke with every Body fir&s;t or la&s;t: When I came to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> his Character was very&punc; &s;trangely compounded of a Mixture of good and evil, no Man &s;poke well of him in the general, all applauded him in par|ticular; he had many Virtues, and few per&s;onal Vices attended him; he had le&s;s Avarice than Ambition, a com|pleat Government of his Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;eemed to be perfectly void of Pride: As to Money, he &s;trove even to a Fault, to merit that Character gien by a fa|mous Author to his Predece&s;&s;or, <HI>(viz.) to be frugal of the Queen's Money, and lavi&s;h of his own:</HI> he had a Genius for the greate&s;t Undertakings, and a Cou|rage equal to the bolde&s;t Attempts; an In&s;tance of which was, the e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the Funds for the Debts unprovided for, and &s;ettling the <HI>South Sea Company;</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="50">
the fir&s;t, even again&s;t the Wills of mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons to whom tho&s;e Debts were due; the la&s;t, again&s;t the univer&s;al Di&s;like of the whole Nation; both which he reduced; and erected &s;uch a Scheme both for a&s;certaining a pre|carious Debt, and appointing an unpra|cticable Commerce, that in le&s;s than one Year, tho&s;e who were the great|e&s;t Oppo&s;ers of the fir&s;t Steps in it, were the Men who bought up all the Stock; in&s;omuch that it was thought by &s;ome, that they oppo&s;ed it at fir&s;t ra|ther becau&s;e they envied him the Succe&s;s of it, than that they did not think it the be&s;t Scheme of its Kind that ever was laid in that Nation: But his Courage has appeared in one Particular, which his wor&s;t Enemies mu&s;t acknowledge, <HI>viz.</HI> His making Twelve Peers at once, when he was in &s;ome Exigence in the Admini|&s;tration of Affairs; a Step, hardly ever ventured upon by any Man before him: And now what is yet more than all the re&s;t, his Intrepidity in Standing his Ground, and hazarding him&s;elf and his Cau&s;e to any Tryal, rather than give his Adver&s;aries any Advantage over him by an ignominious Flight; when at the &s;ame Time, others, who acted under him, have
<PB N="52" REF="51">
done it&punc; and not dared to &s;tand the Tryal; for there is, as I have heard in <HI>England,</HI> one Thing in the Tryals of the Nobility, which, were it to be in any other Nation, would render their Ca&s;e very unhappy, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that when they are obliged to &s;ubmit to publick Ju&s;tice, and appear to plead for their Lives, it may happen that many of tho&s;e Men who give their Votes for their Life or Death, may be their pro|fe&s;&s;ed, declared Enemies; as al&s;o others, who may be depending upon the Court for their Fortunes, by Places and Tru&s;ts: This would be a ju&s;t Objection, and is even allowed in <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf, in the Ca&s;e of any but Peers; for if a Jury-man is charged by the Criminal, for having declared him&s;elf his Enemy, the Exception &s;hall be allowed; but, on the contrary, here, the whole Body of Peers are Jurors, and are to give their Vote: Nor have the Pri&s;oners the Liberty to object, or challenge any of them; likewi&s;e the Sovereign has a Power to make Lords, even out of the Pri&s;oner's wor&s;t Enemies, to add to the Number of tho&s;e who &s;hall try him, and may occa&s;ion his being found guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="52">
This however being the Con&s;titution in <HI>England,</HI> he that &s;eeks to be made a Peer, takes it with all tho&s;e Di&s;ad|vantages, and that alone, <HI>were there no|thing el&s;e to be &s;aid,</HI> takes off all Obje|ction, and makes the Ca&s;e JUST <HI>as to him;</HI> and indeed I think it may be &s;aid not only in this Per&s;on's Ca&s;e, but almo&s;t in any other, that if all who may have profe&s;s'd their per&s;onal Animo&s;ity, or who have been created Peers, while the Ca&s;e may be depending, and all who are in Offices of Profit, from the Sove|reign; I &s;ay, if all the&s;e were to be &s;et by, there would be little Hazard in any Man's being brought to Tryal. But this is a Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Lady who acted the other Part, <HI>as is &s;aid above,</HI> has her Character in few Words, if I may &s;et it down from tho&s;e who know her well, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That &s;he is haughty, &s;ubtle, revengeful; in a Word, one of whom tho&s;e &s;he &s;erv|ed &s;pake much ill, and no Party much good; &s;he made her Fortune and the Fortune of her Family in the little time &s;he was in; and the mo&s;t I could &s;ince hear of her was, that &s;he carried off a great deal of Money.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="53">
I mu&s;t own when I came to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> I found her nece&s;&s;ary to the Bu|&s;ine&s;s I came to negotiate; nor was it her Fault, if &s;ome other Things which we had in our Commi&s;&s;ion did not &s;ucceed: The <HI>able GA&V;TIER</HI> found her very a&s;&s;i&s;ting; and as we were not wanting to &s;hew our Re&s;pect, &s;o had &s;he been as well a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Per&s;on la&s;t &s;poken of as we expected, and had Rea&s;on to expect, we might have &s;een another End of our Negotiation, than what we did.</P>
<P>I cannot omit that I have heard the Dutche&s;s exceedingly blamed for her Conduct in the Ca&s;e of this Lady, and this by <HI>her own Party,</HI> who alledged, that had &s;he kept up to the Queen, and come oftner to Court, not appear|ed di&s;gui&s;ed, and particularly not been ab&s;ent from the Queen at the la&s;t; this Lady could not have &s;upplanted her: In this Ca&s;e they &s;ay, THAT &s;he was not <HI>Courtier enough;</HI> THAT could &s;he have di&s;&s;embled her Re&s;entment, and not with too much Warmth have op|po&s;ed the Queen in her Humour, e&s;pe|cially about the new Notions of Things,
<PB N="55" REF="54">
which, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> the Queen had then entertained, the Queen lov'd her &s;o well, that &s;he would never have parted with her, and &s;he would have had Pow|er enough to have per&s;waded her Ma|je&s;ty again&s;t all the Attempts that could have po&s;&s;ibly been made to &s;up|plant and di&s;grace her; Nay, after long Ab&s;ence, and even &s;ome Unkindne&s;&s;es between the Queen and her, it was &s;aid, that the Queen at her Return from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> to St. <HI>James</HI>'s, at the End of the Summer, 1711. called for the Dutche&s;s, and that a friendly Lady ran to the Dutche&s;&s;es Apartments, and told her of it, pre&s;&s;ing her to lay hold of the Opportunity, a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he might with but one &s;oft Word, be as well with the Queen as ever, and over|throw all her Enemies at once; But that &s;he refu&s;ed to go, tho' her Lodg|ings were on the &s;ame Floor with the Queen's, adding &s;ome very di&s;re&s;pect|ful Words of the Queen, and of her new Favourite; which being related to the Queen, put an End to all Manner of Affection between them, which conti|nued to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>I do not &s;et my Hand to the Parti|culars of this Relation, it being very
<PB N="56" REF="55">
difficult for us in <HI>France</HI> to have an exact Account of &s;uch &s;ecret things Word for Word; but this I may &s;et my Hand to, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that I received this Account from &s;uch Per&s;ons, as to whom I always &s;aw Rea&s;on to give entire Credit; if the Fact is true, I leave it with this Remark, that I think the Dutche&s;s &s;hewed more Ho|ne&s;ty than Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things are proper to the&s;e Memoirs for this End and no other, <HI>(viz.)</HI> as they let us into a clear View of the fir&s;t moving Springs of what followed in the State, and how all the&s;e Things tended at la&s;t to bring on that happy Negotiation, which <HI>Europe</HI> has Cau&s;e to rejoyce in; but which <HI>France</HI> in particular commemo|rates, as being the Means of her De|liverance from inevitable Ruin and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Not that I believe in the lea&s;t, we in <HI>France</HI> are under any per&s;onal O|bligation for our Advantages to the primitive De&s;igns of the&s;e Courtiers; their De&s;ign, it's evident, was the bare re&s;toring them&s;elves to Places in the Admini&s;tration, and to the
<PB N="57" REF="56">
Favour of the Queen; and could they have maintained them&s;elves and the War too, they would have done it gladly; but a Peace with <HI>France</HI> was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to them, a War of Parties among the common Peo|ple being what they fore&s;aw would inevitably fall upon them.</P>
<P>Upon this Foundation, when I came fir&s;t to <HI>England,</HI> I found them under almo&s;t as ab&s;olute a Nece&s;&s;ity of Peace, <HI>as we were in</HI> France; and as we were not &s;o weak as not to di&s;cover it, we found them weak e|nough al&s;o to acknowledge it; on this Account we concealed from them &s;everal Things which were in our Commi&s;&s;ion; for why &s;hould we de&s;ire them to ask more than they were inclin'd to acquie&s;ce in? Or what &s;hould be thought of the King of <HI>France,</HI> to &s;end over Agents &s;o eager to &s;ettle a Peace, as to make Offers of more than would be asked?</P>
<P>But to return to the Queen, her Di&s;&s;atisfactions encrea&s;ing, the Jea|lou&s;ies among the People encrea&s;ed al&s;o; and it began to be known, that the Mini&s;try were not &s;o well

with the Queen as u&s;ual; that there was a Breach between the Queen and the Dutche&s;s; that Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> was every Day with the Queen, and &s;ometimes &s;o long, as that the Mini&s;try were not admitted for a long Time, tho' they came on Bu&s;ine&s;s of Im|portance. It was ob&s;erved al&s;o, that the D&mdash;of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;, who about this Time di&s;covered him&s;elf to be not &s;o well with the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;as before, was more frequent with the Queen and with Mr. <HI>Harley</HI> al&s;o, and <HI>the like;</HI> nor did the Agents of the <HI>Tories</HI> fail to &s;pread the&s;e Things without Doors, as the Principals ad|vanced within; letting the People know, that as their Intere&s;t increa&s;ed with the Queen, &s;o their Party in|crea&s;ed in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>In this Manner Things went on, till all Matters being ready, and the Queen brought over to con&s;ent, the <HI>Coup de Grace</HI> was given; by di&s;mi&s;|&s;ing the great Trea&s;urer at once <HI>with|out the Favour of a hearing;</HI> &s;ending him an Order by the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, that he &s;hould break <HI>his Staff;</HI> and with him fell the Admini&s;tration of the <HI>Whigs</HI> for that Reign: The King mu&s;t

<P>His Maje&s;ty, tho' in a State of War, was never without tru&s;ty Servants in <HI>England,</HI> who were vigilant upon every Occa&s;ion to give him a true State of Things; nor did they fail upon this Occa&s;ion to give the King a clear and full De&s;cription of the new Breaches there, with the Cau&s;es of them, the Ends and De&s;ign of the Parties in them, and &s;uch Ob&s;er|vations thereon, as were &s;uitable to his Maje&s;ty's Affairs, and re&s;pecting the Advantages which might be made of them to our Ca&s;e; at the &s;ame time &s;olliciting earne&s;tly that his Maje&s;ty would &s;end over &s;ome proper Per&s;on to advi&s;e with, and to con&s;ider of

<P>I had known for &s;ome Weeks, that they had in all their Letters mov'd the King to &s;end over &s;ome Per&s;on to re&s;ide <HI>incognito,</HI> to take Care of the Affairs of <HI>France,</HI> and I had &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions that the King would command me upon that Service; <HI>I &s;ay Apprehen&s;ions,</HI> becau&s;e as the Nations had open War, I might have been u&s;ed &s;curvily enough at <HI>London,</HI> if it had appeared that I had acted in the publick Affairs without any Chara|cter: However, I knew my Fate, and that if the King commanded it, I mu&s;t take my Hazard upon the Un|dertaking.</P>
<P>As I expected, &s;o it was not long but the King calling me to him, &s;hew|ed me the Letters he had from time to time received on this Affair, and told me, he had pitch'd upon me for that Service: <HI>Who knows,</HI> &s;aid his Ma|je&s;ty, <HI>but you may have as good Succe&s;s there as you had in</HI> Holland?

now it was Time, not only that the Treachery of the&s;e Things &s;hould be di&s;covered and detected, and the Per|&s;ons expo&s;ed; but that really they were obliged to &s;ay, it was Time <HI>to put an End to the War it &s;elf;</HI> for that the&s;e Things had run the Nation &s;o far in Debt, and brought the rai&s;ing the further needful Sums to be &s;o difficult, that it was not po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t without further Mi&s;chiefs, <HI>which in the End would be in&s;upportable,</HI> to carry the War on any further.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things work'd &s;o well to our Minds in <HI>France,</HI> and were pu&s;hed &s;o effectually in <HI>England,</HI> that our Work &s;eemed done to our Hand, and was partly the Rea&s;on why the King al|tered his Mind, as to &s;ending me to <HI>England</HI> at that Time: His Maje&s;ty was too penetrating, not to know that the&s;e Mea&s;ures would not fail to make way for his own; and had the People in <HI>England</HI> concerted with him, <HI>as I mu&s;t do them the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, they did not at fir&s;t;</HI> they could have done nothing more <HI>a propo</HI> to our De&s;igns; Nay, it was more &s;o, than we expected in this, that it brought them in <HI>England</HI> into Cir|cum&s;tances,

to &s;eek that of our King, which of all other Things in the World, his Maje&s;ty was mo&s;t anxious about, and which we &s;tood in &s;o much Nece&s;&s;ity of, that, two Months before, the King would have given &s;ome Mil|lions to have had it brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>But as the King fore&s;aw now, that what he de&s;ired &s;o much, would &s;oon be asked of him to grant, his Maje&s;ty was too wi&s;e to pu&s;h his Game too fa&s;t; but re&s;olved to &s;tand &s;till a while, and &s;ee what would be the I&s;&s;ue of the&s;e great Events: It is true, this ob|liged his Maje&s;ty to run the Ri&s;que of another Campaign; and &s;ome were very unea&s;ie at that Circum&s;tance, e&s;pecially when they heard, that not|with&s;tanding the great Progre&s;s made in the changing the publick Mini&s;ters at Home, the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;was &s;till continued in the Command of the Army; indeed the King him&s;elf had &s;ome Expectations, <HI>whether founded on certain Intelligences, or in his Maje&s;ty</HI>'s <HI>own Conjectures,</HI> that it would have been otherwi&s;e; and that when &s;o many Mortifications had been put up|on that great Per&s;on, <HI>&s;uch we mu&s;t call him,</HI> he would either voluntarily have
<PB N="68" REF="67">
declined that Service; or the other would not have ventured &s;o much up|on his Genero&s;ity, as not to have ap|prehended his Re&s;entments, in a Tru&s;t of that Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>However, his Maje&s;ty, who &s;aw fur|ther into Things than any of us, and was never at a Lo&s;s in his own Mea|&s;ures, <HI>re&s;olved to venture;</HI> and as it ap|peared afterwards, his Judgment was good; for tho' a Campaign were to prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, the Enemy could not rationally be &s;uppo&s;ed to penetrate further than <HI>Cambray;</HI> and the Affairs of <HI>England</HI> plainly told him, that if they did <HI>hold together</HI> for one Campaign, they would certainly <HI>break</HI> before ano|ther; that either the Duke of&mdash;would not &s;erve another Campaign, or that they would not tru&s;t him; and &s;o it proved.</P>
<P>As to the Affairs in the Field, they appeared in a better Po&s;ture than we expected: The Army was numerous, and compo&s;ed of the be&s;t Troops the whole Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> could produce; <HI>The Hou&s;hold</HI> was filled up and finely clothed, and made the be&s;t Appearance they had at any Time done &s;ince the
<PB N="69" REF="68">
fatal Battle of <HI>Blenheim;</HI> and as they took Po&s;t wi&s;ely on the <HI>Scheld,</HI> to cover <HI>Cambray</HI> and <HI>Arras</HI> at the &s;ame Time; the King ordered the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Villars,</HI> who commanded them, to avoid a Battle, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> and only to lie in &s;uch a Po&s;ture, as to cover tho&s;e two Cities, <HI>(viz.) Cambray</HI> and <HI>Arras,</HI> and that then the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;might do his wor&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mare&s;chal</HI> &s;o well di&s;charged him|&s;elf of this Tru&s;t, that he <HI>not only</HI> a|voided fighting, but did effectually co|ver tho&s;e two Places; &s;o that the Con|&s;ederate Army, tho' much &s;uperior, never could come near them, and were glad to fini&s;h what they call'd a <HI>glorious Campaign,</HI> with the Siege and taking of <HI>Bouchain;</HI> a little Place of &s;mall Con|&s;ideration, and which we retook from them again the next Year, in half the Time they took it now.</P>
<P>As the King was not mi&s;taken in his venturing another Campaign, &s;o nei|ther was he mi&s;taken in his Calculation of the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> and of the Advantage which he &s;hould draw from them by waiting a little longer.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="69">
And here I mu&s;t go back to the State of the Affairs in <HI>England,</HI> with Re|&s;pect to the <HI>new Managers,</HI> particularly as to their Intere&s;t in the Change, and to the Views they had before them at that Time; it is certain, that Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;after all the Machines he had &s;et to Work, in forming this Turn at the Court, when he per&s;waded the Queen to di&s;mi&s;s <HI>the Trea&s;urer,</HI> did not let her &s;ee, neither did he &s;ee him&s;elf, the Nece&s;&s;ity there was for her to go &s;o far as &s;he afterwards found her &s;elf obliged to go: <HI>For Example,</HI> he let her believe, as indeed many other People be|lieved, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that after the Trea&s;urer was out, and a few of his Creatures and Depenoents, the re&s;t of the publick People would &s;oon acquie&s;ce, and be glad to come into her Maje&s;ty's Mea&s;ures, and &s;o Things might <HI>go en,</HI> ju&s;t as they did before; which was certainly the ut|mo&s;t of his fir&s;t Scheme.</P>
<P>Indeed it was very rational to think, that People, who had good Po&s;ts in the Government, and no Fortune of their own, &s;hould have con&s;idered of it be|fore they had thrown up all the Advan|tages they enjoyed; <HI>but &s;o it was,</HI> as
<PB N="71" REF="70">
&s;oon as the Trea&s;urer was turned out, <HI>the Whigs</HI> who were at Court gave him a Meeting, <HI>and there,</HI> as it was &s;aid, &s;olemnly engaged to one another, that they would one and all &s;tand hard and fa&s;t together, and re&s;olve to accept of no Propo&s;als which contained any Thing le&s;s than the re&s;toring them all to their Po&s;ts; and this they performed with ill Nature enough, the Chancellor, the Secretaries, and all the re&s;t, obliging the Queen to di&s;mi&s;s them all.</P>
<P>This, tho' indeed it did by no Means alter the Mea&s;ures of the new Mana|gers in the main, <HI>and only obliged them to make u&s;e of other Hands, than they propo&s;ed at fir&s;t;</HI> yet it was a great Di&s;appointment to Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;who, as he was not of the Opinion, that the <HI>Tories</HI> were the propere&s;t Men to carry on the publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o neither did he think they would come in, <HI>to &s;o compleat a Rule of Management as he had intended;</HI> for his De&s;ign was to have formed a middle Party of NEUTERS, that &s;hould have acted by his Schemes, and under Direction, <HI>as Wheels in a Watch,</HI> perfectly pa&s;&s;ive, except <HI>as wound up,</HI> or <HI>&s;crewed down</HI> by the Engineer, <HI>who was to be him&s;elf;</HI> when therefore the <HI>Whigs</HI>

oppo&s;ed him &s;o warmly, he was driven to the Nece&s;&s;ity of embracing the <HI>Tory Party,</HI> at the Hazard of being obliged to &s;ubmit in many Things to their Mea&s;ures, in&s;tead of having them &s;ub|mit <HI>to his;</HI> nor did he find the <HI>Tories</HI> at fir&s;t &s;o ready to fall in with him as he expected, at lea&s;t not upon general Terms of Subordination to his Mea|&s;ures; <HI>on the contrary,</HI> they offered diffe|rent <HI>Schemes,</HI> from what he had propo&s;|ed, rai&s;ed Difficulties and Scruples a|gain&s;t his <HI>neutral Schemes,</HI> which they called by a Word of their own, TRIM|MING, and in that Ca&s;e they judged much better than he did, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that by coming wholly into a <HI>Tory Admini|&s;tration,</HI> the whole Body of the <HI>High Church</HI> would be entirely with them, who, in Conjunction with the Court, would be &s;o much too &s;trong for the <HI>Whigs,</HI> as to leave them no Room, <HI>&s;o much as to &s;truggle;</HI> but that while they drove at a &s;eparate and mixt Intere&s;t, the <HI>Tories</HI> would come in but warily and &s;lowly; and as the <HI>Whigs</HI> were im|mov$ably fixt again&s;t him, he would never be able to carry his Point.</P>
<P>It was however impo&s;&s;ible to move him, who was &s;o fond of his own

Schemes, till the Cour&s;e of Things brought it about by halves, and by a Kind of Force upon him; This Ob&s;tina|cy was the Ruin of all his De&s;igns, and of his Party too, and will at la&s;t, if I mi&s;take not, bring him and his Friends to fall into the Hands of their implaca|ble Enemies the <HI>Whigs:</HI> When he found the <HI>Tories</HI> thus &s;tiff and backward, he &s;topped his Hand, and tried by the <HI>Queen</HI> her &s;elf, to bring over &s;ome of the <HI>Whig</HI> Lords to come in: The Queen a&s;&s;ured them, and &s;poke at that Time with great Sincerity, that &s;he in|tended no further Alterations; that &s;he de&s;igned no Change of Mea&s;ures, and <HI>above all,</HI> &s;he prote&s;ted that &s;he had not the lea&s;t Thought of altering the Succe&s;&s;ion: Some of the <HI>Whig</HI> Lords were irritated on another Account, and &s;eemed to give too po&s;itive a Denial; but the mo&s;t politick li&s;&s;en'd to the Propo&s;al, and offered to come into the Mea&s;ures, on but two Conditions, <HI>(viz.)

<P><PB N="74" REF="73">
And now Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;was ca&s;t en|tirely upon the <HI>Tories,</HI> and yet &s;o im|po&s;&s;ible it is for politick Men to part with their own <HI>Schemes,</HI> that he never &s;o entirely came into them, as to take <HI>their Mea&s;ures wholly;</HI> nor did they ever come in &s;o far to him, as to be|lieve him <HI>entirely their Friend;</HI> and this mutual Di&s;tru&s;t and Di&s;like drove hundreds from him, increa&s;ed his Op|po&s;ers, and divided the whole Party.</P>
<P>At the pre&s;ent however Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;, being the Spring of the Admini&s;tration, went on his own Way; and the <HI>Whigs</HI> having refu&s;ed to act, he took in the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter:</HI> This was a Step which alarmed the <HI>Whigs</HI> very much, and they might from that Time be &s;ure they &s;hould have no more Applications made to them; and indeed they acted from that Time as Men who were nei|ther to give or take Quarter; The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was a Man, who, of all Men in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Tories,</HI> was really the mo&s;t capable of a high Station without Danger of Mi&s;carriage; and that having been once <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> in the Reign of <HI>King James,</HI> was fully acquainted with the Bu&s;ine&s;s; a Per&s;on

It was the greate&s;t Trial of his Sin|cerity that could be, that the Queen, who was, as above, his near Relation, and for whom he had always a profound Re&s;pect; yet could never engage him to act heartily for her, becau&s;e he e&s;teem|ed her Reign an U&s;urpation upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Stuart,</HI> and he fail'd not to let her know it in the plaine&s;t and open|e&s;t Manner that became his Quality, tho' with the Decency al&s;o that became her Per&s;on.</P>

<P>When I came to <HI>England,</HI> and to ex|amine a little into the&s;e Things, I found that the Inclination to give up this Point to the Whigs proceeded chiefly from the Notion, which not Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;only, but even the Queen her &s;elf, had entertained, of carrying on what they then called <HI>a moderate Admini&s;tration,</HI> and keeping &s;everal of the Heads of the Whigs in their Employment; but it was afterwards confe&s;s'd, that this Notion, <HI>in the Queen e&s;pecially,</HI> proceeded not from any Affection &s;he bore to the Whigs in particular, for &s;he had many Rea&s;ons not to love them, or be plea&s;ed with their Management of her Affairs;

<P>But to return to my Story: The Ele|ctions of their Members, or Deputies of Parliament, were in their Height &s;oon after my Arrival there; and as the Names of the Per&s;ons cho&s;en came to be known, the Court appeared a little chagrin, for that the Number of the Whigs, who were fir&s;t cho&s;en, &s;eem'd to be very much beyond their Expecta|tion; e&s;pecially in that the Whigs boa&s;t|ed that their chief Strength lay in the We&s;tern or Northern Part of the I&s;land, particularly the Provinces or Shires of <HI>Cornwall, Devon, Somer&s;et, Dor&s;et, Wilts,</HI> &amp;c.

in his Intere&s;t, being him&s;elf a Native of the Province of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> from whence they &s;ent up no le&s;s than 44 Deputies to the Parliament.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t do this Ju&s;tice to Mr. <HI>H&mdash;, (viz.)</HI> that if he was not &s;o re&s;olved at fir&s;t in the Mea&s;ures taken, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> for the di&s;&s;olving the Parliament, yet he left no Stone un|turned in the managing the Elections, after he was come into it; and that he did this &s;o effectually, and with &s;o much Judgment and Succe&s;s, that even the <HI>Earl of Godolphin</HI> lo&s;t almo&s;t all the Elections in that, which was call'd <HI>his own Country:</HI> There was not a Town where his Intere&s;t was &s;trong, but he &s;aw him|&s;elf &s;upplanted, and an Intere&s;t form'd to oppo&s;e and overthrow him; <HI>the like Succe&s;s</HI> was &s;een in other Parts; and in a Word, it appeared that he had laid his Mea&s;ures &s;o true, and was &s;erved &s;o pun|ctually, that at the &s;umming up of the Numbers, the Whigs &s;aw them&s;elves di&s;tanc'd, and out-numbered in a &s;ur|prizing Manner, as to the Deputies of their lower Parliament: As to the up|per Parliament, or upper Hou&s;e, as they term it, he had his Eye &s;o intent upon that al&s;o, was &s;o vigilant in taking his Advantages, and &s;o dextrous in improv|ing

<P>It is &s;ignificant to ob&s;erve, how little the&s;e People differ from us in <HI>France,</HI> in the Effect of an ab&s;olute Monarchy, after all the Boa&s;ts they make of their Liberty, the Subordination of their Kings to the Sovereignty of the Laws, the ancient Rights of the People, which they call their Birthright, &amp;c. &s;eeing by the Power of Court Artifice, the Influence of Money, and the Management of &s;ub|tle State&s;men, the People are always made Tools to operate in their own Bondage; and to enthral them&s;elves, ei|ther to this, or that Party, or Prince, as effectually, as if the &s;aid Prince had them under his ab&s;olute Direction; Nay, in this al&s;o, the Prince has the Advan|tage, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that this is done &s;o by the Agency of the Mini&s;ters, that the Ty|ranny is always charged upon them, and the Prince is not blamed; and if ever the Power of the Law gets an Inter|val to exert it &s;elf, it is the Mini&s;ter who bears the Re&s;entment, not the So|vereign; of whom no more is de&s;ired, but to change Hands, and all things are quiet in a Moment: It's true that it has been otherwi&s;e, as in the Example of King <HI>James;</HI> but the Rea&s;on of all that

Difference lay in the impolitick Mea&s;ures of the Prince, who e&s;pou&s;ed his Mini&s;ters to his own Ruine, and took the whole upon him&s;elf: But wi&s;e Princes in that Country have no more to do, but to let their Mini&s;ters &s;ubject the Con&s;titution to the ab&s;olute Will of the Sovereign, by the in&s;en&s;ible Degrees abovementioned, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are as ea&s;ily made Slaves as other Nations; Nay, they will make them&s;elves Slaves, for they will &s;ell and betray their own Liberties and Rights for Money; as they effectually do, who &s;ell their Votes in the Choice of the De|puties of Parliament: And it is mo&s;t cer|tain, that &s;uch is the Blindne&s;s and Unconcernedne&s;s of the People of that ob&s;tinate Nation, and &s;o far are they from having any Notion of the Circum|&s;tances of their Con&s;titution, that what|ever Mini&s;try comes in Play, and will wi&s;ely di&s;po&s;e &s;uch Sums of Money as are nece&s;&s;ary for the Work, they &s;hall not want a Parliament to their Minds; who may give up to them all tho&s;e valuable Rights that a Nation can po&s;&s;e&s;s, who have the be&s;t Con&s;titution in the World.</P>

The Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;&mdash;continued in the Command of the Army; whether it was the Queen's Kindne&s;s to, and Confidence in him, or the Di&s;&s;atisfaction and Diffidence it might have occa&s;ioned among the Allies, I do not re&s;olve: But there &s;eemed an ir|reconcilable Feud between him and the Duke of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;, a <HI>Scotch</HI> Nobleman of
<PB N="100" REF="99">
ri&s;ing Fame, and as full of Ambition as of Merit.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;in Birth and Blood was beneath no Man in that Queen's Court, and by his Gallantry in the Field, had obtained the Fame, not only of a Man per&s;onally brave, but of a very good Officer; he had too much of the <HI>Scots-man</HI> in him, to &s;ubmit to any Man more than he could not help; and too much Sen&s;e, to be wanting to his Ambition; he had &s;everal Ways, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, let it be known, that he did not think him&s;elf well u&s;ed by the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, and it was not doubted but, upon the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion that offered, he would let it be known al&s;o that he knew how to re&s;ent it: It began to be &s;een that on all Occa&s;ions he was building upon the Ruins of his Rival; and having no other Way to act at that Time, he joins in with a Party, who, on the very &s;ame Founda|tion of Di&s;gu&s;t at the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, moved to an Enquiry into the Conduct of the Affairs of the War in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>It fell out very happily for <HI>France,</HI> that at the very Time when this Conte&s;t began, the Queen received Advice that the Duke <HI>de Vendo&s;me,</HI> at the Head of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Army, had &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="101" REF="100">
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops at <HI>Briheuga,</HI> and taken them all Pri&s;oners of War, with their Generals <HI>Stanhope, Carpenter,</HI> &amp;c. and had after this pu&s;hed Count <HI>Starembergh</HI> with the Army of the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles,</HI> to the Nece&s;&s;ity of fighting at <HI>Villa Vico&s;a</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and had obtained a compleat Victory.</P>
<P>To re&s;tore this, the Queen appeared very vigorous, and the Parliament join|ing with it, warm Re&s;olves were taken on all Sides for the carrying on the War with VIGOUR; a Phra&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had been very fond of, and the Clau&s;e was added thus, <HI>e&s;pecially in</HI> Spain.</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more <HI>a propo</HI> to his Maje&s;ty's Intentions, who would have been very glad to &s;ee the Weight of the War removed from <HI>Flanders,</HI> where it lay <HI>too heavy indeed for all</HI> France <HI>to &s;upport;</HI> and to have it carried into <HI>Spain,</HI> where every 10000 Men the Confederates carried into the Field, mu&s;t co&s;t them as much as 40000 Men in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and where they would &s;oon have been weary of the War: Now we began to &s;ee that the King's Mea&s;ures were ju&s;t, and that his Maje&s;ty had nothing to do, but to &s;it &s;till and wait, while the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by their Divi&s;ions,
<PB N="102" REF="101">
Breaches, and Quarrels, would do all this Work to his Hand.</P>
<P><HI>This carrying on the War</HI> E&s;pecially in <HI>Spain, became now the Party-Word in</HI> England; <HI>the Queen opened the new Parliament with a Speech, wherein &s;he has this Expre&s;&s;ion:</HI> The carrying on the War in all its Parts, but particularly in <HI>Spain,</HI> with the utmo&s;t Vigour, is the like|lie&s;t Means, with God's Ble&s;&s;ing, to procure a &s;afe and honourable Peace.</P>
<P>I had the Curio&s;ity, as a Stranger, and <HI>incognito,</HI> to get in among the Croud to their Parliament Hou&s;e, when the Queen made this Speech; and nothing could be a more agreeable Surprize to me, than to hear tho&s;e Words: I knew this would do our Work at once, for we had nothing to fear on that Side; and indeed, as I learn'd &s;ince my Return, the Word was a Kind of Je&s;t or Diver|&s;ion to all <HI>France</HI> for &s;ome Weeks.</P>
<P>Their Mirth was increa&s;ed, when they had &s;ent them the Addre&s;s or Compliment, u&s;ually returned by the Nobility to the Sovereign on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. The Words were eccho'd back to the Queen thus, <HI>(viz.) We con|ceive it to be of the highe&s;t Importance to carry on the War with</HI> VIGOUR <HI>in all its Parts, but e&s;pecially in</HI> Spain:
<PB N="103" REF="102">
When the King read this in a Letter wherein I &s;ent an Account, he laughed heartily, <HI>Ouy Me&s;&s;ieurs,</HI> &s;ays the King, <HI>il et de tres grand Importance aux</HI> France; Yes, Gentlemen, it will be of the highe&s;t Importance to <HI>France,</HI> if you plea&s;e but to carry on the War, <HI>e&s;pecially in</HI> Spain: The Commons or Deputies of the Lower Hou&s;e, had the very &s;ame Words; <HI>We &s;hall &s;tudy to carry on the War with Vigour, e&s;pecially in</HI> Spain; all this was in <HI>December,</HI> and they &s;oon found an Occa&s;ion &s;uitable; for on the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> the Queen received the News of the taking her Troops in <HI>Briheuga,</HI> and the Lo&s;s of the Battle at <HI>Villa Vico&s;a,</HI> mentioned above; all which News, as it was known in <HI>France</HI> before they had it in <HI>England,</HI> the King took Care they &s;hould hear of it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Things going on thus agreeably for us, it is not to be wondered that the King, with all the Satisfaction imagina|ble, re&s;olved to wait the Event of ano|ther Campaign in <HI>Flanders;</HI> not for|getting at the &s;ame Time to &s;end ex|pre&s;s Orders to the Duke <HI>de Vendo&s;me,</HI> to pu&s;h the Enemy with all po&s;&s;ible Vi|gour, which he failed not to do.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="103">
This Notion of <HI>e&s;pecially in</HI> Spain, as it was really in it &s;elf the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd Thing, <HI>&s;peaking as an</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Man,</HI> which that Nation could have entered upon; So, on the other Hand, <HI>&s;peaking as a</HI> French <HI>Man,</HI> it was the mo&s;t op|portune and &s;ea&s;onable Folly that ever our Enemies could have been taken in; and nothing was more a&s;toni&s;hing to us, than that it could be po&s;&s;ible the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;try &s;hould go voluntarily into &s;uch a Snare: The King was &s;o &s;urprized, that he began to think it was the Effect of my &s;ecret Management in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;aid to a certain Per&s;on of Quality, that had an E&s;teem for me, that he had been very well &s;erv'd in <HI>England;</HI> upon which that Per&s;on took Occa&s;ion to felicitate me in very ob|liging Terms: But alas! I had no Claim to any of the Prai&s;e, nor had I &s;o much as made any of my Acquaintance yet in <HI>England,</HI> much le&s;s begun any Negotia|tion: But all this was the Produce of per&s;onal Enmity at the Glory of the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, and was laid as a Train to blow up his Intere&s;t at Court; but whether it an&s;wered their End in <HI>England</HI> or not, yet we have Rea&s;on to remember how well it an|&s;wered ours in <HI>France,</HI> and how many
<PB N="105" REF="104">
Ways it &s;erved us here: And the King failed not to make his Advantage of it fir&s;t; tho' it did not much le&s;&s;en or weaken the Confederate Army in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> nor remove the Duke from the Command; yet it le&s;&s;en'd his Intere&s;t in general; it di&s;pirited his Friends, turn|ed many again&s;t him, and gave him le&s;s E&s;teem, tho' not le&s;s Authority in the Army; likewi&s;e it was naturally the Occa&s;ion of great Contention in their Parliament: The <HI>Whigs</HI> undertook to prove, that the only Way to recover <HI>Spain,</HI> was to pu&s;h the War on in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> where they had the Superiority of Strength, and where they had made already &s;uch Progre&s;s, as had been very threatning to <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, and where, if the War was carried on with a little more Succe&s;s, they &s;aid there was a Probability of penetrating <HI>France,</HI> and breaking thro' into the open Country, where at lea&s;t they &s;hould live at the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Expence; in which Ca&s;e it was not to be doubted, but <HI>Spain</HI> would be given up to &s;ave <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This was a &s;ad Truth to us, and we were very &s;orry to find that any Men in <HI>England</HI> had &s;o right a Notion of it; And here begun my fir&s;t acting in the
<PB N="106" REF="105">
Intere&s;t of my Country; which I did, tho' with the greate&s;t Privacy, yet with no &s;mall Succe&s;s; for getting the Knowledge of a certain capable Per&s;on, by Means of a <HI>French</HI> Printer, and the Help of &s;ome Money rightly placed; I furni&s;hed &s;ome Arguments to &s;et forth the Strength of the <HI>French</HI> Frontiers, the Impo&s;&s;ibility of fini&s;hing the War by taking Towns one or two in a Year; and the certain lengthning out the War by that Method, till <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be impoveri&s;hed, and the Trade ruined; and the&s;e with other Arguments being put together, the Per&s;on I &s;peak of form'd very happily indeed, and pub|li&s;hed in Print; and &s;uch was the Dex|terity of this Author, that he put the &s;ame Arguments into &s;everal Forms, Printing now one Tract, then another: The&s;e Books did us exceeding Service, and made a great Noi&s;e at that Time in <HI>London;</HI> But of this I &s;hall make further Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><HI>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, however,</HI> that what the Whigs &s;aid at that Time, of our Danger by the War in <HI>Flanders,</HI> was very true; Why el&s;e did we make &s;o many Attempts to obtain a Treaty, and put an End to it, and offer that King <HI>Philip</HI> &s;hould quit <HI>Spain</HI> and the
<PB N="107" REF="106">
<HI>Indies</HI> to obtain a Peace? But the other Party gave it a new Turn, they ca&s;t it all back upon the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;and his Friends, as if they were of that Opinion, only to ju&s;tifie their pa&s;t Con|duct, and aggrandize and enrich them|&s;elves by the Command; and thus it became a Party Quarrel; in which it was evident, the Court &s;upported the Duke of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;, on Purpo&s;e to mortifie the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;and the Whigs.</P>
<P>This Quarrel was not only happy for us, but that Happine&s;s was encrea&s;ed by the Appearance we &s;aw, that there was no Probability of its being clo&s;ed; and that it might grow wider and wider, I applied my &s;elf to my mo&s;t ingenious Writer of Pamphlets: The great Thing I de&s;ired of him now was, that he would publi&s;h &s;omething if po&s;&s;ible, for I acknowledge I could not procure one Word to a&s;&s;i&s;t in it, to prove to the People the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of pu&s;hing the War on in <HI>Spain,</HI> rather than in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e Writers of Pamphlets in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> are the be&s;t People of the Kind that are any where to be found; for they have &s;o many Turns to impo&s;e upon their People, that nothing I have met with was ever like it; and the People of
<PB N="108" REF="107">
<HI>England,</HI> of all the People I have met with, are the fonde&s;t of &s;uch Writings; My Writer had an excellent Talent, and Words enough, and was as well qua|lified to prove non-Entities to contain Sub&s;tance, and Sub&s;tance to be entirely Spirituous, as any one I have met with; I was no Judge of his Style, having but little of the Tongue; but as I kept him entirely private, I found the People al|ways eager to read what he wrote, and frequently his Books were &s;aid to be written by one great Lord, or one emi|nent Author or other; and this made them be more called for at the Book|&s;ellers than ordinary, and the Man gain|ed by the Sale, be&s;ides what I allow'd to him, which was not incon&s;iderable: It was a great Di&s;appointment to me, in &s;ome other Views I had at that Time, that this Man fell &s;ick and died: I at|tempted once or twice to furni&s;h my &s;elf with another, but could never get one like him, except a certain Per&s;on, who the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Re&s;ident, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lyencroon,</HI> recommended, and who wrote an excellent Tract in our Intere&s;t, enti|tuled, <HI>Rea&s;ons why this Nation</HI> (meaning <HI>England) ought to put an End to this expen&s;ive War,</HI> &amp;c. I was extremely plea&s;ed with that Piece, tho' I could not read it di&s;tinctly, and for that Rea&s;on
<PB N="109" REF="108">
had it tran&s;lated into <HI>French,</HI> and cau&s;ed it to be Printed at St. <HI>Omer</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and di&s;per&s;ed thro' the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and at <HI>Paris,</HI> for the publick Informati|on of our own People. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lyen|croon</HI> u&s;ed his Endeavour to bring this Author into my Mea&s;ures; and to faci|litate the Thing, I cau&s;ed an hundred Pi&s;tols to be conveyed to him, as a Compliment for that Book, and let him know, it came from a Hand that was as able to treat him honourably, as he was &s;en&s;ible of his Service; But I mi&s;&s;ed my Aim in the Per&s;on, tho' perhaps the Money was not wholly lo&s;t; for I after|wards under&s;tood that the Man was in the Service of the State, and that he had let the Queen know of the hundred Pi&s;tols he had received; &s;o I was ob|liged to &s;it &s;till, and be very well &s;a|tisfied that I had not di&s;covered my &s;elf to him, for it was not our Sea&s;on yet.</P>
<P>This Kind of &s;ecret Negotiation was now the mo&s;t of our Employ in <HI>London,</HI> where, with my &s;elf, there was now no le&s;s than five &s;ecret Agents of <HI>France</HI> employed, as well to li&s;ten into every Thing that was doing in Publick, as to infu&s;e proper Notions into the Minds of the People who we were among, as we had Occa&s;ion; and &s;o faithfully was
<PB N="110" REF="109">
the King &s;erved in the&s;e Things, that although we did not all corre&s;pond with one another, yet being all guided by the &s;ame Hand, we took the mo&s;t regular Mea&s;ures; and as there was nothing pa&s;t without our Ob&s;ervation, &s;o the King was &s;ure to have an exact Account of every Thing that was done or doing, either in the City or the Court.</P>
<P>The Campaign now drew on, and the Armies were preparing to take the Field, the King took Care that the Ar|my in <HI>Flanders</HI> was greater than at any Time the Year before; the Regiments all compleated and clothed, the <HI>Hou&s;|hold</HI> e&s;pecially, made a very fine Appear|ance, but at the &s;ame Time his Maje&s;ty gave expre&s;s Orders to the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Villars,</HI> not to come to a Battle, but to encamp &s;o if po&s;&s;ible, as to cover the Frontiers, and prevent a Siege; for this, &s;ays the King, will be our la&s;t Campaign, if we can avoid a Blow.</P>
<P>As I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Field, it relates not to the&s;e private Remarks to take Notice of what pa&s;t between the Armies; only in general it may be proper to enter &s;omething about it in the&s;e Minutes: In <HI>Spain,</HI> where the Allies were to carry on the War ESPECIALLY, the Duke of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;was &s;ent to com|mand;
<PB N="111" REF="110">
but if he had <HI>more Troops</HI> than u&s;ually the Queen employed there, the re&s;t of the Allies <HI>had le&s;s;</HI> the Lo&s;&s;es of their late Action at the End of the la&s;t Campaign, lay &s;o heavy on them, and the <HI>German</HI> Troops had &s;uffered &s;o much, were &s;o ill recruited, and, <HI>which was wor&s;e,</HI> &s;o ill paid, that all Count <HI>Starembergh</HI> and the <HI>Duke</HI> could do, was but to encamp on the Banks of the <HI>Segra,</HI> and wa&s;te the whole Summer without any con&s;ide|rable Action; which, <HI>to us,</HI> was a Victo|ry, being all that the King expected: In <HI>Flanders</HI> it was much the &s;ame Thing, the two Armies faced one ano|ther a long while on the Banks of the <HI>Sen&s;et;</HI> the Confederates had <HI>Douay</HI> in their Reer, and watched an Occa&s;ion to attack <HI>Arras</HI> or <HI>Bouchain;</HI> the <HI>French</HI> had <HI>Cambray</HI> in their Reer, <HI>Bouchain</HI> on their Right, and <HI>Arras</HI> on their Left, and their Bu&s;ine&s;s was to cover them all; they dodg'd and watch'd one another a great while, till the Time &s;pun out, and it was the latter End of <HI>July</HI> before any Thing was done; when the Duke indeed making a Feint of marching to|wards <HI>Arras,</HI> gave the Mare&s;chal <HI>Villars</HI> the Slip, and by a &s;wift Countermarch pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Scarp</HI> and the <HI>Sen&s;et,</HI> and got behind our Lines; The Mare&s;chal was
<PB N="112" REF="111">
enraged at this Surprize, and had he not been limitted by the King's expre&s;s Orders, would have come to a Battle, which, before their whole Army was come up, he had indeed an Opportunity to do with Advantage: But being ob|liged to follow his In&s;tructions, he had no more to do, but to lye &s;till, and &s;uf|fer <HI>Bouchain</HI> to be inve&s;ted.</P>
<P>People were very merry at <HI>Paris</HI> with the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Villars</HI> on this Occa|&s;ion, who, in his Ga&s;conading Humour, had boa&s;ted in his Letters for a Month before, that he would an&s;wer for that Campaign, that the Confederates &s;hould neither have a Battle or a Siege; but the King was ea&s;ie enough &s;o long as no general Battle had been fought; and no Man knew the true Scituation of his Affairs &s;o well as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In a Word, <HI>Bouchain</HI> was attacked after a World of Time &s;pent, in the nece&s;&s;ary Caution, our Army being &s;o near; the Town made a great De|fence, and held out &s;ome Weeks; and the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Villars</HI> got as much Credit by obliging the Confederate Army to go into Winter Quarters with|out undertaking any other Enterpri&s;e, as he lo&s;t by being &s;urprized at fir&s;t: We, who were in <HI>London,</HI> could not
<PB N="113" REF="112">
but &s;mile to &s;ee the Whigs and Tories fall out about the Glory of this Campaign; one Side complimenting the other Side; mocking the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;upon the great Succe&s;s and glorious Progre&s;s of the Confederates Arms; The <HI>Tories jeering,</HI> asked the <HI>Whigs</HI> when they thought <HI>France</HI> would be conquered at the Rate of a <HI>Bouchain</HI> in a Summer? and how many Millions of Money <HI>Bouchain</HI> had co&s;t, more than the Ground it &s;tood on was worth? The <HI>Whigs,</HI> on the other Hand, taunted the <HI>Tories</HI> with their new Schemes for carrying on the War, ask'd them, what they thought now of ESPE|CIALLY in <HI>SPAIN;</HI> and whether the Duke of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;or the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;were the better Generals? They upbraided them with the Duke of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;being as unea&s;ie at &s;erving under Count <HI>Starembergh,</HI> as he was before under the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;; and asked them, if he had tran&s;mitted no Di&s;contents at the Conduct of that General? They bad them ca&s;t up the Expences, and &s;ee whe|ther the Campaign in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where <HI>&s;omething</HI> was got for their Money, was not a better Account than that in <HI>Cata|lonia,</HI> where the Money was &s;pent, and <HI>nothing</HI> at all done.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="113">
We were not behind Hand to farther the&s;e Complaints on both Sides, as Oc|ca&s;ion offered; for as our De&s;ign was to repre&s;ent the War in &s;uch Colours, as &s;hould per&s;wade the People to think it a Grievance; &s;o we concurr'd in all the Je&s;ts they made on one Side as well as on the other; nor indeed were tho&s;e mutual Railleries un&s;erviceable to our Intere&s;t, &s;eeing they mutually di&s;couraged the People in the Affair of the War in gene|ral; made them think it tedious and burthen&s;ome, and the Notions of Peace, which we were &s;oon to introduce, the more agreeable and de&s;irable on many Accounts.</P>
<P>I am now come to the &s;ub&s;tantial Part of this Management; The Campaign was over, in which, by lo&s;ing no more, we gained a &s;ufficient Victory; the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> might &s;ay in as boa&s;ting a Manner as they plea&s;ed, that they had gained a glorious Conque&s;t; the more they boa&s;t|ed in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, the more would they be expo&s;ed; for even in <HI>England</HI> the People found that the War was very little nearer an End than it was before; the <HI>French</HI> Army was whole and un|broken, and the Confederates only &s;o much more in Debt than they were be|fore.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="114">
But as the King, by the Authority of his own Judgment, re&s;olved before, <HI>even again&s;t the Opinion of all about him,</HI> to make no Steps towards the Mea&s;ures he had de&s;igned, till Things were in a Po&s;ture to his Mind; No, tho' he run the Ri&s;que of another Campaign, <HI>which in|deed, as is &s;aid, we were all full of Ap|prehen&s;ions about;</HI> &s;o now, tho' our Ap|prehen&s;ions were over, the King re&s;olved that the Time was now come to begin: This &s;hewed that the King's Mea&s;ures were not laid according as the War was, or was not pre&s;&s;ing, but according to the Progre&s;s of Things in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, where his Intelligence was punctual and exact, and of which he was the be&s;t Judge.</P>
<P>The Tories had, as is &s;aid, fixed them|&s;elves in the Admini&s;tration in <HI>England,</HI> and Mr. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;having carried his Point in every Thing, was made Trea|&s;urer: But the Oppo&s;ition which the Whigs made in every Step was great, and the certain Views they thought they had of plunging the Mini&s;try into Diffi|culties by the War, buoy'd them up in that Oppo&s;ition; nor was it an im|probable Thing, but that they &s;hould be liable to the &s;ame Mi&s;take, which they found it their Intere&s;t to blame the o|ther

for; nor was the new Mini&s;try a little embarra&s;&s;ed with the Difficulties which the ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance of the Whigs brought them into, with Re&s;pect to their Credit, and the rai&s;ing the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Funds for the War: When the King &s;aw the&s;e Things, he pre&s;ently concluded, that NOW <HI>was the happy Juncture,</HI> which he had &s;o long waited for; and that &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;try were threatned by their Enemies with being di&s;abled from &s;upporting the War, it was not to be doubted but they would accept of having the Glory of making an honourable Peace; and <HI>France</HI> had no more to do, but <HI>to make &s;ome Propo&s;als,</HI> that &s;hould be more particu|larly advantageous to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation than ever was offered before.</P>
<P>The Mare&s;chal <HI>Tallard</HI> was a Pri&s;oner of War in <HI>England,</HI> but was confin'd to an honourable Re&s;traint in the Country, at a Town called <HI>Nottingham,</HI> about an hundred <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles from <HI>London;</HI> But the King having entru&s;ted the Mare|&s;chal with his Mea&s;ures, I was ordered to go to <HI>Nottingham</HI> to concert Mea&s;ures with him, in what Manner to break the Ice, and how to bring the Mini&s;try to hearken to Propo&s;als of Peace.</P>

<P>Your Lord&s;hip, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> will pardon me then, if what I &s;ay reflects on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>He bid me u&s;e my Freedom, adding, that he &s;hould take nothing ill; Be&s;ides, &s;aid he, you only relate the Opinions of your Country-men, you do not &s;ay they are your own.</P>
<P>I told him, we thought they acted in <HI>England,</HI> as if they carried on this War merely to de&s;troy; and to act Revenge up|on Nations and People, not to obtain the Ends they pretended to fight for; and
<PB N="118" REF="117">
that this, we thought, was not Chri|&s;tian.</P>
<P>He replyed, if it were true in Fact, he would grant it was not Chri&s;tian; but, &s;ays he, <HI>I &s;ee no Ground for the Sugge&s;tion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lord, &s;aid I,</HI> the Sugge&s;tion is very ju&s;t; for you mu&s;t carry on the War for meer Glory, to build a Fame to the Reign of your Queen; or, <HI>which would be wor&s;e,</HI> for the per&s;onal Ambition of your Gene|rals and Officers.</P>
<P>Ambition do you call it! &s;aid he, <HI>turning very quick upon me,</HI> if you had &s;aid for getting of Money to our Generals and Officers, I would not have taken much Pains to have ju&s;tified them, for ought I know that may be part of their De&s;ign.</P>
<P>I told him, if I cho&s;e rather to call it <HI>Ambition</HI> than <HI>Avarice,</HI> it was, that I would not &s;ay any Thing di&s;obliging, but I included them both in my Meaning.</P>
<P>He asked me upon what Foundation I charged them with &s;uch a Thing.</P>
<P>I told him, becau&s;e it &s;eem'd evident, that they cho&s;e to obtain that by fight|ing and &s;hedding Blood, which, there was no Que&s;tion, might be obtained by amicable and Chri&s;tian Methods.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="118">
Then I find, &s;aid he, you would lay the Beginning of the War at our Door.</P>
<P>No, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I am not going back to Things &s;o remote; but if the &s;ame Things can be obtained by a Peace, which you can expect by the War; How can you be &s;aid to carry on the War on a Chri&s;tian Principle?</P>
<P>He told me, this was begging the Que&s;tion, for that it did not appear that they could obtain the&s;e Things by a Peace.</P>
<P>No, my Lord, &s;aid I, but it appears you reject all Offers of <HI>Treating,</HI> and by that, you may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to reject all the Offers of a Peace; Did ever Nation make War before, and &s;hut the Doors again&s;t all Propo&s;als of Accommodations?</P>
<P>He told me, I laid my Charge very clo&s;e, but that he did not &s;ee that they rejected all Propo&s;als: There were Propo&s;als indeed made, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> but they could be brought to nothing; I know not where the Fault lies, &s;ometimes we blame your People, and &s;ometimes our own.</P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily &s;atisfie your Lord&s;hip, &s;aid I, where the Fault lay; and I added, that the U&s;age we met with there, would have broken off any Treaty in the World.</P>
<P>I differ from you exceedingly, &s;aid my Lord, and mu&s;t be allowed to think, that there was a much greater Complaint made, than there was Occa&s;ion given.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="119">
I told him, that to avoid Di&s;putes with his Lord&s;hip, I would wave that; But, &s;aid I, mu&s;t there then, my Lord, never be an End of a bloody War, becau&s;e that Treaty came to nothing?</P>
<P>He replyed, that if the King of <HI>France</HI> were &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to Peace, <HI>there was no doubt,</HI> but there might be Ways found out to have his Propo&s;als hearkned to again by the Allies.</P>
<P>And I return'd to his Lord&s;hip, that were tho&s;e Ways found out, <HI>there was no doubt,</HI> but the King of <HI>France</HI> was &s;in|cerely di&s;po&s;ed to Peace: But, my Lord, &s;aid I, are not all the Doors barr'd again&s;t receiving Propo&s;als? Do they think the King will take all the low Steps for a Peace that they &s;eem to &s;ugge&s;t, even to implore it of them?</P>
<P>No, indeed, <HI>&s;aid my Lord,</HI> I &s;ee no Door barr'd up, any of the Parties con|cerned may hear Propo&s;als, tho' none can fairly enter upon any Treaty, without the Participation of the Allies.</P>
<P>I told him, they might legally perhaps; but all the Allies were &s;o afraid of one ano|ther, that none of them cared to meddle; e&s;pecially, &s;aid I, my Lord, you in <HI>England</HI> dare not do it, you would be in&s;ulted pre|&s;ently, and taxed with carrying on a &s;epa|rate Treaty with <HI>France,</HI> the outed Party want no other Handle again&s;t you.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="120">
There may be &s;omething in that indeed, &s;aid he, but were I &s;ure your King would but make an honourable and a practica|ble Offer, I would concern my &s;elf to bring the Government to hear it.</P>
<P>I told him, I wi&s;hed his Lord&s;hip was as able to a&s;&s;ure me of the la&s;t, as I was &s;ure of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Truly, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I make the Offer; be|cau&s;e I confe&s;s I am of the Opinion which you mentioned before, that to carry on the War, when a ju&s;t Satisfaction may be obtained by a Peace, is unchri&s;tian and unlawful; But let us be &s;atisfied, that you will make fair and honourable Propo&s;als.</P>
<P>My Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if your Lord&s;hip will concern your &s;elf to have Propo&s;als ac|cepted, I will concern my &s;elf to have &s;uch made to you? But I fear you promi&s;e more than you can obtain.</P>
<P>We broke off this Di&s;cour&s;e at this Point, and I not only acquainted Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tallard</HI> the Mare&s;chal of it, but the King him&s;elf; who, in Return, ordered me by all Means to renew tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, and if I could introduce any Thing of a Trea|ty, I &s;hould &s;oon have further Directions.</P>
<P>It was not many Days, before my Lord gave me an Opportunity to &s;ee him again; and I could ea&s;ily perceive that he had thought what we di&s;cour&s;ed was &s;o con|&s;irable, that it was worth communicating
<PB N="122" REF="121">
to &s;ome of the great Men then in Bu&s;ine&s;s, who had encouraged him to &s;peak with me again upon that Head: We di&s;cour&s;ed long, and entered into many particular Debates on the Management of the la&s;t Treaty, how &s;evere the Terms, and how rigidly in&s;i&s;ted upon, &amp;c. I complain'd, that if the Confederates would not treat in another and more equal Manner than that was, they could not expect any Po|tentate would treat with them at all; at lea&s;t, not till they were driven to the la&s;t Extremity, and to a much greater Di&s;tre&s;s than they could &s;uppo&s;e the King of <HI>France</HI> was yet brought to, or he was likely to be brought to in many Years; tho' their Succe&s;&s;es &s;hould continue in the War to be as great as before.</P>
<P>My Lord took up that Ca&s;e &s;omething &s;hort, and told me, <HI>that</HI> the People of <HI>England</HI> were very &s;anguine in the Affair of <HI>the War;</HI> and that they made no Que|&s;tion, by the Superiority of their Forces, to compel the King of <HI>France</HI> to comply with all their Demands, and even to accept of wor&s;e Conditions than tho&s;e he refu&s;ed at <HI>Ghertruydenburgh:</HI> He told me, that I could not but &s;ee that we lo&s;t Ground every Year, and that one Town or two more falling thus every Year, the Time mu&s;t come at la&s;t, when there would be no more Towns to take; and that then it mu&s;t be di&s;puted in the Field.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="122">
I replyed, but with a great deal of Re|&s;pect, <HI>that</HI> I believed his Lord&s;hip rather &s;poke the common Sentiments of a Party, than his own; <HI>That</HI> he knew the People were taught to &s;peak thus, to carry on a De&s;ign, rather than that they who in|&s;tructed them, believed it them&s;elves; <HI>That</HI> I thought it was a Di&s;pute, which it was needle&s;s to enter upon, to examine only how long the War might la&s;t, and which Nation would &s;oone&s;t be reduced to a Nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;iring an End of it; <HI>That</HI> the People of <HI>England</HI> had long been flat|tered with the Words, <HI>one Year more,</HI> and <HI>one Year more;</HI> and yet I left it to his Lord&s;hip to con&s;ider impartially, whether the <HI>French</HI> had not rather gain'd than lo&s;t by the War, &s;ince the refu&s;ing the Prelimina|ries; <HI>That</HI> tho' it was true we had lo&s;t <HI>Bou|chain</HI> this Year, which fell by an accidental Surprize, and a Finene&s;s in the Art of War; yet, <HI>That</HI> on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> we had pu&s;h'd the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> to an open Retreat, and had lived at the Expence of the <HI>Germans</HI> all the Summer; <HI>That</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> we had won a glorious Victory, &s;urrounded and taken all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Troops Pri&s;oners, and in the Con&s;equence of tho&s;e Defeats, had regained that whole Kingdom, and reduced the Confederate Army to lie on the de|fen&s;ive, and little better than under the Cannon of <HI>Barcelona; That</HI> we had taken
<PB N="124" REF="123">
<HI>Torto&s;a</HI> and <HI>Gironne,</HI> and not left them any Place of Strength, but that Capital, in the whole Country of <HI>Catalonia&punc;</HI> but that notwith&s;tanding this, and however, <HI>we that were</HI> French-men were of Opinion, the Confederates had as much Rea&s;on to de&s;ire Peace as we; yet it was manife&s;t, the King of <HI>France</HI> did openly de&s;ire Peace, if it might be had upon equal and ju&s;t Conditi|ons; But that, as I &s;aid before, <HI>I thought</HI> the Confederates pur&s;ued the War with an unchri&s;tian Temper, being rather willing to obtain their End by the Sword, than by Treaty: I added, that as the <HI>God of Ju&s;tice</HI> was Witne&s;s to the Sincerity of the King's De&s;igns, &s;o it could never be ex|pected, that Heaven would pro&s;per tho&s;e, who &s;eem'd to pur&s;ue a War, merely for the cruel and unju&s;t Ends of enriching one Nation by the Ruin of another; That I was per&s;uaded, if the Queen had the&s;e Things rightly repre&s;ented to her, her Maje&s;ty was a Prince&s;s of too much Humanity, to countenance the carrying on a War, when <HI>all that could be expected by the War,</HI> was ready to be given her by a Peace; and that without impoveri&s;hing and racking her Subjects, without ruining their Commerce, and de&s;troying the Na|vigation; and in a Word, without the Deva&s;tation of War, and the &s;hedding of Chri&s;tian Blood: I begg'd his Lord&s;hip
<PB N="125" REF="124">
to con&s;ider the&s;e Things; and as his Ho|nourable Station gave him Opportunity to lay the&s;e Things before the Queen, I &s;hould e&s;teem it greatly my Honour and Satisfaction; and I believed &s;o would his Lord&s;hip too, if this accidental Di&s;cour&s;e&punc; which had been begun without any View or De&s;ign, by an ob&s;cure Traveller and Stranger, might be a Means to lay a Foun|dation of &s;o glorious an Event, as that of Peace to &s;o many Nations, who were at this Time involved in this dreadful and de|&s;tructive War.</P>
<P><HI>His Lord&s;hip li&s;&s;en'd to this Di&s;cour&s;e very attentively; but when I had done, he gave me an An&s;wer &s;miling, which I did not &s;o well under&s;tand the Je&s;t of, till &s;ome Time:</HI> MONSIE&V;R, <HI>&s;ays my Lord,</HI> you talk ju&s;t the Language of our new Gentlemen at Court, you make me &s;mile to think, that either you in <HI>France</HI> have convers'd with them, <HI>OR,</HI> they have learned from you; <HI>I made no Reply to this, not &s;eeming to under|&s;tand it, as indeed at fir&s;t I did not; but when this Di&s;cour&s;e was over, his Lord|&s;hip told me, he thought in his Con&s;cience there was no Difficulty &s;o great in the Affair of Peace, as that of making and receiving the Propo&s;als;</HI> That is very true, <HI>my Lord, &s;aid I,</HI> and that is the Rea&s;on, why I &s;aid you do not carry the War on like Chri&s;tians; and that the Door is barr'd a|gain&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="125">
Applications of Peace: <HI>Nay, my Lord, &s;aid I,</HI> have not the Confederates u&s;ed their Intere&s;t in all the Courts of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom,</HI> to de&s;ire that no Prince &s;hould offer his Mediation? Is not this te&s;tifying that they re&s;olve to have no Peace? And is not this contrary to the &V;&s;age of all Nations?</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip &s;eemed offended at this, and &s;aid, there was no Occa&s;ion in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e for Propo&s;als; the King knew what the Confederates in&s;i&s;ted on, the Preliminaries were yet in being, and his Maje&s;ty had no more to do, whenever he really de&s;ired Peace, than to &s;end Word to the States, that he accepted the Preli|minaries, and the War would immediately cea&s;e; and if he did not do thus, it was him, <HI>the King,</HI> who continued the War, not the Confederates.</P>
<P>I replyed, that his Lord&s;hip knew very well, that the Preliminaries, not to &s;peak of the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the Conditions, did not &s;ub&s;i&s;t now; that Things were in another Scituation, &s;o that many of tho&s;e Conditions were impracticable; That, for Example, the Arch-Duke was beaten out of <HI>Spain,</HI> and King <HI>Philip</HI> remained victo|rious; and if it was not in the Power of <HI>France</HI> then, to oblige him in two Months to quit the Throne, much le&s;s would it be &s;o now; That the Arch-Duke was now declared Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> and there
<PB N="127" REF="126">
was Rea&s;on to que&s;tion, <HI>whether all the Allies</HI> would de&s;ire he &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy al&s;o, which Addition would overthrow the Balance of <HI>Europe,</HI> which had been &s;o much &s;poken of by the late Plenipotentiaries; that if the King thought it hard, to oblige his Grand&s;on to quit the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Throne before, he mu&s;t needs think it both hard, with Re&s;pect to his Grand&s;on, and un&s;afe to his own King|doms, to do it now; But that there was no doubt, but Expedients might be found out if a Treaty was &s;et on Foot, and that perhaps, Propo&s;als might be made equally &s;afe for <HI>Europe,</HI> if a Medium was but found out, for the bringing &s;uch Propo&s;als on the Stage.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip told me, the&s;e were ju&s;t the common Topicks of the new Mini|&s;try, who looked as if they were in Con|cert with our People of <HI>France,</HI> to make the treatying ea&s;ier than it was.</P>
<P>I replyed, if they were willing to make Treating ea&s;ie to us, they were &s;o much better Chri&s;tians than others; that if they were in Concert with any of our People, I &s;hould be glad; I only wi&s;hed for the common Good of the World, that ours were in Concert with them, or with any one el&s;e, that a good Peace might be &s;ettled.</P>
<P>That is what I wi&s;h as well as you, <HI>&s;aid my Lord,</HI> but we &s;hall all differ about what

you call a GOOD PEACE; What is good for one, will not be thought good for another; you &s;ee they could not agree about it in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>I returned, that we might perhaps in <HI>England</HI> for all that.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;ays my Lord,</HI> your Propo&s;als mu&s;t be made there.</P>
<P><HI>But why not in</HI> England, my Lord, &s;aid I?</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays my Lord,</HI> I cannot tell; I think any one of the Allies may receive Propo&s;als, and communicate them to the re&s;t; Why do ye not make them?</P>
<P><HI>Now I had brought it as far as I thought was convenient for the pre&s;ent, &s;o I turned off that clo&s;e Que&s;tion thus;</HI> Nay, <HI>my Lord,</HI> I am no Mini&s;ter of State, I am but a private Gentleman; I only entred into the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es by Accident, your Lord&s;hip &s;eeming not to di&s;like the Conver&s;ation; I wi&s;h I had Inte|re&s;t among the great Men on both Sides, I would &s;oon bring them together, and <HI>France</HI> &s;hould make &s;uch Propo&s;als to all the Allies, and to the Queen in-particular, as &s;hould be better to <HI>England</HI> than ever was made yet.</P>
<P>My Lord returned with a great Free|dom thus: Mon&s;ieur, I am very &s;orry to hear what you now tell me; for we were gone &s;o very far, that I verily thought you had &s;ome Intere&s;t in the Affair, and would at la&s;t produce me a &s;ufficient Au|thority to go farther with you; I will

<P>About the Return of the Po&s;t, I took an Occa&s;ion to meet my Lord again; and he asked me if I had heard any Thing further about that Affair; I told him, I had; and that the fir&s;t Thing I had to ask of his Lord&s;hip was, whether he would give me leave to bring into his Company a Gentleman, who had Credentials &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy him, that what he &s;aid was with Authority, and might be depended upon; He an&s;wered me, that he could not go that Length without Leave of the Queen, but that this was he acknowledged a good Advance for &s;o &s;hort a Time on my Part, and he would mention it if I was willing, as a Mark that we were &s;incere in the De|&s;ign; I told him, I had but one Reque&s;t to his Lord&s;hip, which was, that he would give me his Honour for concealing me, and every one el&s;e, till it might be conveni|ent to own what they were about; <HI>You need not capitulate with me,</HI> replyed my Lord, <HI>for that; I would not have it known on my own Account, for</HI> Ten Thou&s;and Pound; <HI>and the Mini&s;try, I am &s;ure, would not for</HI> ten times the Sum, <HI>you have my Word for it.</HI></P>

We parted at that Time, and met again the next Evening; when my Lord &s;eeing me come into the Room alone, he looked a little di&s;appointed; <HI>What are you alone, MONSIE&V;R,</HI> &s;ays he?

<P>He was greatly &s;urprized when he &s;aw this, and e&s;pecially when he knew my Name; and ri&s;ing from his Seat, paid me the Re&s;pects due to an Amba&s;&s;adour.

&s;poke a good while to the Queen again, and when he had done, the Queen turn'd to me, and &s;aid, <HI>'Tis a good Work, pray God &s;ucceed you in it; I am &s;ure I long for Peace, I hate this dreadful Work of Blood;</HI> at which, her Maje&s;ty &s;hook her Head 2 or 3 times, &s;aying &s;ome other Words that <HI>I could</HI> not hear, which I was very &s;orry for; and then the Queen retired, and we with|drew: The Work was now on the Anvil, and we had nothing to do, but to appoint our Meetings, and go on with it; nor were we long about it.</P>
<P>I avoided as carefully as my Lord could de&s;ire it, the entring into a formal Nego|tiation; the chief of our Di&s;cour&s;e turned upon the Method of the making and re|ceiving Propo&s;als, &s;o as to give no Um|brage to the Allies; which, it was ea&s;ie to &s;ee, they would take upon the fir&s;t Ru|mours of &s;uch a Thing: I was willing for a while to put it to his Lord&s;hip to give me his Opinion, in what Manner the Mi|ni&s;try here would act; But he declined that Part, only this he granted me, which he &s;aid, was to avoid Ceremony, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was as &s;incerely de&s;irous to entertain the Notion of Peace, as the King of <HI>France</HI> was to make it: and as the Queen her &s;elf had let me &s;ee her warm De&s;ire for putting an End to the Calamities of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o he
<PB N="135" REF="134">
would not hide it from me, that it was his Opinion, that the Mini&s;try had no other Way to &s;upport their new Engagement, and carry on the Schemes they had laid, but to bring this Treaty to a Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I replyed, that I was very glad to find &s;uch a good Di&s;po&s;ition in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court to put an End to the War; and &s;ince his Lord&s;hip had proceeded hitherto in a generous Confidence with me, I &s;hould endeavour to merit the Favour, by all the honourable and generous Terms po&s;&s;ible; That I hoped, I need not &s;ay any Thing of the &s;incere De&s;ire which the King had to enter into a fair Treaty with all the Allies, the many low Steps his Maje&s;ty had taken to bring the former Treaty to pa&s;s, and the Hard&s;hips which he had &s;ub|mitted to in the carrying it on, had te&s;tifi|ed &s;ufficiently that he de&s;ired nothing more; And as I was &s;atisfied, his Maje&s;ty would meet with more honourable Treat|ment in <HI>England,</HI> and that either they would treat with him with Re&s;pect, or not treat at all; &s;o I was commi&s;&s;ioned to en|ter with her Maje&s;ty into &s;uch a particular Agreement, or <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> re&s;erv'd <HI>Articles,</HI> for her own Part, as &s;hould demon&s;trate the &s;incere Re&s;pect the King my Ma&s;ter had for her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Intere&s;t; which <HI>&s;ecret Articles,</HI> being not to take Place, until the general Peace was made,
<PB N="136" REF="135">
could be no Inju&s;tice to any of the Allies, to whom the King is willing to give all rea&s;onable Satisfaction, according to the mutual Engagements of the Confederacy.</P>
<P>My Lord replyed, he was a&s;&s;ured, that if <HI>England</HI> treated with us at all, it would be with all the Re&s;pect and good Breed|ing imaginable; but he que&s;tioned very much, whether they would be brought to any Thing, without the Surrender of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, as a Preliminary.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that it was my Opinion, that Ca&s;e had received &s;uch a Turn by the Arch-Duke being made Emperor, and by King <HI>Philip</HI> having recovered it all out of his Hands, that it would be found at a Treaty, that all the Allies would not be of the &s;ame Mind in that Article, that they were in before; Nay, that <HI>Great Britain</HI> her &s;elf would not be equally willing to put &s;o great a Part of <HI>Europe</HI> into one Hand, as the Empire and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy would be, joined to the many Kingdoms and Countries al|ready po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and that it much rather concern'd them to prevent it.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;ays my Lord,</HI> it will immediately occur to us, that neither can it be &s;afe to <HI>Europe,</HI> that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy &s;hould be join'd to the powerful Dominions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon;</HI> and this our People
<PB N="137" REF="136">
are already very jealous of; Nay, it was the Rea&s;on for the Beginning of the War.</P>
<P>I replyed, that I granted all this; but that if then a Medium might be found out, by which <HI>Europe</HI> might be &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured that this &s;hould never come to pa&s;s; and that one and the &s;ame Per&s;on &s;hould never be King of the two King|doms at the &s;ame Time; that then a firm Peace might be made between the Nations, tho' the immediate Surrender of <HI>Spain</HI> was not made a Preliminary.</P>
<P>He told me, if &s;uch a Medium could be found out, he would be of my Mind; but he did not &s;ee how it was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Of the Po&s;&s;ibility, my Lord, &s;aid I, the Plenipotentiaries may treat; and if they do not find it po&s;&s;ible, then we have no more to &s;ay; In the mean time, it's a Treaty only that we are at pre&s;ent upon, in which Ca&s;e, I dare venture to grant it as a Preliminary, that the King will freely, and <HI>bona fide,</HI> con&s;ent to all &s;uch Mea&s;ures as &s;hall appear ju&s;t and rea&s;on|able, that the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> may never be united on the Head of the &s;ame Prince.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord &s;eemed plea&s;ed at this, and &s;miling, &s;aid,</HI> You give me now &s;ome View of a Peace, which indeed I never had before; <HI>I grant,</HI> if this can be &s;ecured, the End of
<PB N="138" REF="137">
the War is an&s;wered; <HI>I confe&s;s,</HI> I was never for giving <HI>Spain</HI> to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> &s;ince the pre&s;ent King <HI>Charles, (&s;o he called him,)</HI> was made <HI>Emperor;</HI> only upon this Foundation, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that it was better to him, than to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon;</HI> but if you can find out a Way to &s;ecure <HI>Europe</HI> from the Conjunction of the two Crowns, the End is effectually an&s;wered.</P>
<P><HI>My Lord, &s;aid I,</HI> tho' I make no Que&s;tion &s;uch Mea&s;ures may be found out, yet the finding them out, or propo&s;ing them, is not our pre&s;ent Work; if it is made a Prelimi|nary, that is enough for the pre&s;ent; if after that they cannot adju&s;t it, we cannot help that; all we do now &s;tands for nothing, unle&s;s they agree.</P>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays my Lord, <HI>pray put that Head down in Writing:</HI> I did &s;o, and he carried it away with him, and told me, he did not doubt but to bring me a very good Account of it by the next Evening; who he &s;hewed it to, I know not, but he brought the next Evening a great many Minutes made upon the Subject, &s;ome of which he read to me; in which I found very little Evidence of the Per&s;ons having under&s;tood the Thing they had viewed, and yet I found them very willing to go on upon the de&s;igned Negotiation.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="138">
The next Day we met again, when my Lord pre&s;&s;ed me vehemently to enter with him into the Mea&s;ures which are mentioned in the Propo&s;als; but I told him it did not belong to us, our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;et a Treaty on Foot, not to begin the Treaty it &s;elf; <HI>Well, but,</HI> &s;ays my Lord, <HI>we may make a Conver&s;ati|on upon the Head as private Per&s;ons;</HI> My Lord, &s;ays I, <HI>my In&s;tructions do not allow me to treat; but if your Lord&s;hip de&s;ires to talk in Confidence, I have too great an A&s;&s;urance of your Ju&s;tice, to &s;cruple putting all that Confidence in your Honour, that the greate&s;t Freedom of Di&s;cour&s;e calls for.</HI></P>
<P>Tell me then, &s;ays he, <HI>Do you think the Thing you propo&s;ed about SPAIN fei&s;ible?</HI> I returned with a Que&s;tion, <HI>Can your Lord|&s;hip doubt it?</HI> His Lord&s;hip clapt his Hand upon the Table, and I think &s;wore, that he could not &s;ee any Thing in it but <HI>Renunciations;</HI> and that, he &s;aid, was a Thing &s;o contemptible in <HI>England,</HI> that the very common People would hi&s;s it out of the Nation; every one having in Me|mory the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Treaty, and the many Renunciations made there, which never|thele&s;s were of no Moment, the King of <HI>France</HI> being powerful enough to break them: Here I told his Lord&s;hip, that I
<PB N="140" REF="139">
conceived, even from his la&s;t Words, that there was a manife&s;t Difference between a weak King renouncing his Claim to a Strong Kingdom, and a Strong King re|nouncing a weak Kingdom.</P>
<P>This &s;tartled him again for a while; but after mu&s;ing &s;ome Time, he &s;aid, he believed if the King of <HI>France</HI> was re&s;olv|ed to have &s;uch Renunciations take Place, it might be in his Power to con&s;olidate them by naming the Heirs, and embark|ing all the Confederates in a Guarrantee to &s;upport the Heir in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We had a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e on that Head, and it took us up the whole Evening, but either I made him a Convert to my Opi|nion, or he was &s;o by the Con&s;equences of private Circum&s;tances, for by this Time I began to find the new Managers, who were all in the &s;ecret, were impatient for &s;ome <HI>Coup d' eclat,</HI> to &s;top the Vio|lence of the Whigs, who layed clo&s;e Siege to them, and began to grow very &s;trong.</P>
<P>We met again the next Day, and my Lord told me, he had &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered what we talked of the Night before, and he did not &s;ay but what I had offered had Weight in it, but the Thing was of &s;uch Moment, and it would he &s;o heavy on the Mini&s;try, if they &s;hould make a De|mand &s;hort of what was offered before,
<PB N="141" REF="140">
that they could not &s;upport it; and there|fore he de&s;ired to ask me, if a Treaty was granted on tho&s;e Heads, would the King give the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;ome &s;uch Security that he was &s;incere, as &s;hould be more than was annext to the la&s;t Treaty, and as might be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tifie their Proceedings to all the Allies; I returned to this immediately, that as this was re|mote from what we met about, &s;o I hoped he did not expect my Reply in the Form of an Agent; he &s;aid, no, no, but as a private Conver&s;ation; <HI>Why then,</HI> my Lord, &s;aid I, <HI>what Security would you ask?</HI> His Lord&s;hip returned in a Manner, that ea&s;ily made me under&s;tand he was direct|ed; <HI>Will ye give us</HI> Dunkirk? <HI>Give it you!</HI> my Lord, &s;aid I, <HI>how do you under|&s;tand giving it you?</HI> Give it us as a Pledge of the Sincerity of the King's Intentions: How, &s;aid I, again, will you return it again after the Peace? Nay, &s;ays my Lord, we cannot &s;ay that; but you may give it into our Hands, as a Pledge to be di&s;po&s;ed of afterwards, as by the Peace, when it is concluded, &s;hall be di|rected.</P>
<P><HI>Dunkirk,</HI> my Lord, &s;aid I, is an unva|lued Trea&s;ure, but there is nothing the Queen can ask of the King my Ma&s;ter,
<PB N="142" REF="141">
but what in Dependence upon her Ma|je&s;ty's Ju&s;tice he will be ready to grant.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid he, I would have you write about it; if the King will make a Depo&s;it of that Value in our Hands, I think we &s;hall then have no Rea&s;on to doubt his Sincerity, and I dare &s;ay, on &s;uch a Te&s;timony of his Maje&s;ty's Confi|dence in the Queen, her Maje&s;ty will think her &s;elf obliged to contribute all that in her lies, to put an End to the War, and will look upon the King as her Friend and Allie.</P>
<P>My Lord, &s;aid I, as I am &s;ure there is nothing on Earth which the King my Ma&s;ter de&s;ires more, than a &s;trict Amity with her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty; I dare a&s;&s;ure you, without Writing about it, that he will not &s;cruple to make that Sacrifice to her Maje&s;ty, as a Pledge of his Pa&s;&s;ion for her Friend&s;hip; and when we come to talk clo&s;er on tho&s;e Things, I &s;hall give your Lord&s;hip Satisfaction in that par|ticular.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that when his Lord&s;hip had gained this Point, he was &s;o big with it, that he was unea&s;ie to be gone; and I be|lieved afterward he went directly to the Queen with it.</P>
<P>NOW, by this Time I was &s;o well acquainted with the Court, that I had
<PB N="143" REF="142">
&s;ecret Intelligence of many Pa&s;&s;ages, and particularly I had this Lord watched eve|ry Night when he went from me, &s;o that I knew very well who he communicated his Proceedings to, and con&s;equently, who he concerted Mea&s;ures with; and I quickly learned that his Di&s;cour&s;e to me, though he called it private Conver&s;ation, was all under the In&s;tructions of a &s;ecret Com|mittee of the Managers of that Time, the Queen her &s;elf perhaps often pre&s;ent; the Thoughts of getting <HI>Dunkirk</HI> into their Hands, I found took with the Mini&s;try extremely, as a Thing which would re|commend them to the People, and make the Peace &s;eem particularly advantageous to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>They owned to me afterwards, that it was the more grateful to them, as they were a&s;&s;ured it would be a Mortification to the old Mini&s;try, who never had an Opportunity to ask &s;uch a Thing, or even a Po&s;&s;ibility of it; all their Demands having been made at &s;econd Hand, by the Mini&s;ters of the States General, who would be &s;o far from asking &s;uch a Thing, e&s;pe|cially to have it put into the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that if We had offered it, they would not have con&s;ented to it, but would have in&s;i&s;ted to have it gar|ri&s;on'd
<PB N="144" REF="143">
by an equal Number at lea&s;t, of their own Troops.</P>
<P>They were not backward neither, to acknowledge that the having <HI>Dunkirk</HI> put into their Hands, was the more agree|able to them, as they knew it would be a &s;en&s;ible Mortification to the States General; who, at that Time, they look|ed upon as &s;ecretly abetting and &s;upport|ing the Faction, as they called it, of the Whigs again&s;t them.</P>
<P>After therefore I had a&s;&s;ured them, that the King had ordered me to let the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> know, that he would make that Sacrifice to the Zeal he had for her Maje&s;ty's Satisfaction, and to the De&s;ire he entertained of entring into a &s;trict Friend&s;hip with her Maje&s;ty and her People; I found them in &s;o good a Hu|mour as to every Thing el&s;e, that I had much le&s;s Difficulty to bring other Points to a Conclu&s;ion than I expected; and particularly from this Time, I found my Lord&mdash;came readily into the Article of the Renunciations, and the Rea|&s;onablene&s;s of keeping <HI>Spain</HI> out of the Hands of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> I found al&s;o, that the Arguments I had u&s;ed with his Lord|&s;hip, were pre&s;ently made the popular Ar|guments of the Town; from whence I drew &s;everal Inferences for my private Govern|ment;
<PB N="145" REF="144">
Fir&s;t, I found by it, that the Mini|&s;try were but indifferently furni&s;hed be|fore with a true Notion of the War they were carrying on; and were not &s;orry to have &s;omething put into their Thoughts to an&s;wer the received Opinion of the People of <HI>England,</HI> (viz.) <HI>That no End could be put to the War, without King</HI> Philip <HI>was dethron'd;</HI> which dethroning, appearing every Day more and more diffi|cult, the putting an End to the War, which above all Things was nece&s;&s;ary to them, &s;eemed impracticable; and to &s;ay the Truth, this Difficulty embarra&s;&s;ed them very much: The Whigs had made the carrying on the War &s;uch a Principle in the State, that to talk otherwi&s;e was, among the People, a Kind of Trea&s;on at that Time again&s;t their Con&s;titution; and it was an admirable Policy in the Whigs to do &s;o; for had the Mini&s;try been ob|liged to carry on the War Abroad, they could very ill have &s;upported them&s;elves again&s;t the Oppo&s;ition they met with at Home; And it was upon this Occa|&s;ion, that Mr. <HI>St. John,</HI> at that Time <HI>Se|cretary of State,</HI> when &s;omething was &s;aid in their Parliament concerning &s;ecret Councils, to the Prejudice of the Publick, openly declared in the Hou&s;e of Parlia|ment, that <HI>the Mini&s;try was oppre&s;&s;ed by a</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="145">
Faction, <HI>with de&s;ign to make the carrying on the War difficult; and that her Maje&s;ty was therefore re&s;olved to make Peace upon the be&s;t Terms &s;he could, that &s;he might not come again into the Management of her own Servants.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place, I found that the Mini&s;try were full of Re&s;entments again&s;t the <HI>Dutch;</HI> not only for their offering to interpo&s;e with the Queen in the Ca&s;e of the late Changes at Court, which they called an In&s;olence un&s;ufferable, and med|dling with her Maje&s;ty's private Admini|&s;tration; But for their Tampering, as it was call'd, with the publick Affairs of <HI>Britain,</HI> entring into Confidences, and keeping Corre&s;pondences with the old Mini&s;ters, after they were di&s;placed; &s;upporting their Intrigues, and making Engagements with them, which, as they gave out, they had di&s;covered; <HI>particu|larly</HI> their prevailing with the Duke of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;not to demit the Command of the Army; <HI>and I was told, that they pretended to have Intelligence</HI> that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had offered A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Duke, and his Friends, if he &s;hould find it for the Publick Good, to oblige the new Mi|ni&s;try by Force to lay down; whether they had any Ground for that Sugge|&s;tion, or that they thought it for their
<PB N="147" REF="146">
Service to per&s;uade the Queen to believe it, were it true or not, is yet a Secret to mo&s;t People; But I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to &s;ay the latter was the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But to go back to our Negotiation: We were &s;till upon the Subject of what Conce&s;&s;ions would be nece&s;&s;ary on the King's Side, not only to &s;atisfie the Queen of his Maje&s;ty's &s;incere Re&s;olutions for Peace, but al&s;o to ju&s;tifie the new Mi|ni&s;try in the Mea&s;ures they were to take for a Treaty, by the Advantage of the Offers; and tho' all that we did, was but in Confidence, and taken <HI>ad referen|dum,</HI> yet we went through the Points as if we had been Plenipotentiaries empow|ered to treat, and conclude every Thing we di&s;cour&s;ed of.</P>
<P>Al&s;o we were not without our poli|tick Steps in this Affair on both Sides; for as I ea&s;ily perceived how great an Alteration the Offer of giving up <HI>Dun|kirk</HI> to them had made in their Temper; how open, how free, and how ready they were to grant on their Side, <HI>as it were,</HI> in Return for &s;o generous a Propo&s;al; &s;o I failed not to make &s;ome Advantages of it, and improve it to make a Demand of &s;omething to be given us in Return, and as an Equivalent: When I fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed this to my Lord&mdash;, he
<PB N="148" REF="147">
&s;eemed &s;truck and &s;urprized, and I ea&s;ily perceived the Effects of it increa&s;ed the next Day, after he had communicated it to the Queen; for coming to mention it among other Di&s;cour&s;es, <HI>he told me,</HI> I had the Art of blowing hot and blowing cold; that I gave with the one Hand, and took away with the other; That I had made them believe the King would &s;acrifice <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to her Maje&s;ty, as an A&s;&s;urance of his Sincerity, &amp;c. and that now I talked of an <HI>Equivalent,</HI> which he, &s;aid I, knew was not in her Maje&s;ty's Power to offer, and that it &s;eem'd to him, as if I had repented the Compliment that was offer|ed, or had found it was too ea&s;ily accept|ed, and was willing to throw a Diffi|culty in the Way, and render it impra|cticable; that &s;o we might keep <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> without &s;eeming to break our Word.</P>
<P>I &s;eemed &s;urprized at this Explanation of my Meaning, which I alledged was unkind, and that it &s;uppo&s;ed me to be very di&s;ingenuous in my Propo&s;als; I told his Lord&s;hip, that <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was not only the &s;tronge&s;t Bulwark of the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy, and the Port to a great Part of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions; but had co&s;t the King immen&s;e Sums, as well to purcha&s;e it, as to fortifie and improve it, and to put it into the Condition of one
<PB N="149" REF="148">
of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t important Fortre&s;&s;es in the World; and as his Frontiers would be left naked, and his Revenues infinitely impaired by the giv|ing it up, &s;o it was but rea&s;onable that &s;ome Equivalent &s;hould be given to his Maje&s;ty for &s;uch a Lo&s;s; but I added, that his Lord&s;hip had no Rea&s;on to &s;ugge&s;t any Thing unkind or unfair, in the Man|ner of my propo&s;ing it, and e&s;pecially the Explanations which I &s;hould give it, would fully &s;atisfy his Lord&s;hip that no|thing could be le&s;s in my Thoughts, or remoter from my Views: That for Ex|ample; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the Equivalent I propo&s;ed, I told him, was referr'd to the general Treaty, but that the King would imme|diately put her Maje&s;ty in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Place; <HI>Secondly,</HI> That they knew the Queen could not give this Equivalent, none of the Acqui&s;itions in <HI>Flanders</HI> be|ing in her Maje&s;ty's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but that it mu&s;t come from the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and all that &s;hould be expected was, that her Maje&s;ty would think her &s;elf obliged, to u&s;e her Intere&s;t with the Allies in the en|&s;uing Treaty, to give &s;uch an Equivalent, which there was no doubt, they would comply with, after it was openly menti|oned in the Preliminaries&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="149">
My Lord&mdash;was a Man of too much Sincerity, to manage a Con|ference of this Kind with any, who would take Advantage of tho&s;e Things; I could ea&s;ily perceive, even in his Coun|tenance, the Satisfaction this Declarati|on of my Meaning in the Word, an <HI>Equivalent,</HI> gave him; for he had, as he frankly told me afterwards, looked upon the Treaty as entirely broken off, and at an End upon that Head; and as I placed it, he was made perfectly ea&s;y, for it mattered not much, as I perceived, what the Equi|valent was, &s;o long as the <HI>Dutch</HI> were to give it; and we &s;oon adju&s;ted that Equi|valent between our &s;elves to be the City of <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> and the Towns of <HI>Douay</HI> and <HI>Bouchain,</HI> or any Alternative for the latter, as &s;hould be determined after|wards in a Treaty; as I made this Ad|vance upon them, on Account of the Fondne&s;s they &s;hew'd of getting <HI>Dunkirk</HI> into their Hands; &s;o they were not be|hind Hand with me, in taking Advanta|ges of the Forwardne&s;s which I had &s;hewed in &s;o unexpectedly offering &s;uch a Compliment to the de&s;ired Treaty; and my Lord began to enquire, if we had nothing el&s;e to offer on the Account of the Negotiations, to the particular Intere&s;t of the Queen; for that <HI>Dunkirk,</HI>

Offer of the highe&s;t Nature, and there|fore qualified effectually to convince her Maje&s;ty of both; that I appealed to his Lord&s;hip, whether I had not outdone even his Expectations, that after &s;uch an Advance, I was &s;urprized to hear his Lord&s;hip ask me, <HI>What el&s;e I had to offer?</HI> But as this was a Te&s;timony that his Ma|je&s;ty could deny nothing her Maje&s;ty had Rea&s;on to de&s;ire, &s;o if there was any Thing el&s;e, in which the King could oblige the Queen, if her Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed to let me know it, I would faithfully repre&s;ent it to the King, and did not doubt but I &s;hould obtain it.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip an&s;wered, that there were &s;ome private Things the Queen would de&s;ire, and &s;ome publick; the la&s;t of which, he &s;aid, it was rea&s;onable to make a Part of the Preliminary Agreement, and therefore &s;hould be mentioned as &s;uch, <HI>(viz.)</HI> a &s;olemn Recognition of her Ma|je&s;ty's Title, and of the Settlement of the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>
<P>I could not but &s;mile at this Propo&s;al.

<P>My Lord&mdash;returned, that we mu&s;t talk no Trea&s;on; that the Queen could not admit of any Explanations, whatever her Maje&s;ty's Intentions might be; That the Succe&s;&s;ion was &s;ettled by Act of Parliament, and their Enemies de&s;ired no better Handle again&s;t them, than to find they &s;hould omit any Thing in a Treaty which the Nature of the Thing called for, towards a further Secu|rity of that Settlement; That as to the private Sentiments of the Queen, or of any about her, they could &s;ay nothing about that: This he &s;aid with &s;uch an Air, as let me under&s;tand that he gave a &s;ecret A&s;&s;ent to what I had propo&s;ed; <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> that I had not &s;poken &s;o di&s;agree|able of that Part as he &s;eemed to &s;ugge&s;t; But he &s;aid there were many Rea&s;ons why

<P>My Lord replyed, that he would remem|ber it; upon which, I told him, I did not que&s;tion but a Per&s;on would be &s;ent over, in the Cour&s;e of this Negotiation, to &s;et that Matter in a true Light, and to give her Maje&s;ty full Satisfaction of what Views the King had of that Kind before him; for that I was &s;ure, his Ma|je&s;ty would re&s;olve to take no Mea&s;ures without fir&s;t acquainting and con&s;ulting her Maje&s;ty, and directing all Things according to her Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>&s;aid MY LORD,</HI> let us talk no more of it now; when that Treaty begins, I &s;hall de&s;ire that I may be no Plenipotentiary.</P>
<P>Upon this we wav'd the Di&s;cour&s;e for the pre&s;ent, and I told my Lord, that as to her Maje&s;ty's Title in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the
<PB N="155" REF="154">
King had ordered me to acknowledge it in Form, and to a&s;&s;ure the Queen, that he would be Guarrantee for her quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with his utmo&s;t Force, and with all his Power, and leave it upon his Succe&s;&s;ors to do the &s;ame; and &s;he had no more to do, than to order it to be in&s;erted in the &s;tronge&s;t Manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>My Lord de&s;ired I would put it into Writing, which I did in the very Words which were afterwards publi&s;hed, and called the Preliminaries; <HI>(viz.) That he will acknowledge the Queen of</HI> Great Britain <HI>in that Quality;</HI> he pre&s;&s;ed me to add the other, which I declined for &s;ome Time, but afterwards did, tho' in the mo&s;t am|biguous Terms; thus, <HI>(viz.) As al&s;o the Succe&s;&s;ion of that Crown, according to the</HI> PRESENT <HI>Settlement;</HI> He would have had me added, <HI>on the Hou&s;e of</HI> HANO|VER; but this I intreated him not to de&s;ire of me, and told him, I could by no Means be concerned in it; &s;o he in|&s;i&s;ted no more on it.</P>
<P>We returned then to the Di&s;cour&s;e of other Branches of the Queen's publick Demands; But I entirely prevailed with him to let nothing more be mentioned in Publick: At fir&s;t I told him, that the
<PB N="156" REF="155">
acknowledging the Queen and the Set|tlement, and the giving up <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with a Declaration that all the re&s;t of the Al|lies &s;hould receive Satisfaction in their rea&s;onable Demands at the Treaty, was enough to convince her Maje&s;ty of the King's upright Intentions, and were in them&s;elves Preliminaries enough, at lea&s;t for us to talk of; adding, that if more were found convenient, we might re&s;olve them afterward.</P>
<P>I then asked his Lord&s;hip, if he would plea&s;e to communicate his Thoughts to me upon any further Demands which the Queen had to make, and that we might di&s;cour&s;e on them &s;till in Confi|dence as before; He told me, he would communicate &s;ome to me, but that there were &s;ome Things, which he would not mention, till he had further In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>He told me, that hitherto <HI>England</HI> had acted the generous Part in all the Trea|ties that had been made, and that the Allies had thought fit to let her do &s;o, without &s;hewing any Concern for her Intere&s;t, as if the Queen had no Intere&s;t of her own to pur&s;ue; or that the Allies had no Intere&s;t to look after but their own: That the Mini&s;try, tho' it was not only Ju&s;tice to the Queen, and doing
<PB N="157" REF="156">
their Duty to their Country, but it both recommended them and the Treaty al&s;o to the whole Nation; that &s;omething &s;hould be &s;tipulated for the Honour and Advan|tage of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and that particu|larly re&s;pecting her Commerce, and the Increa&s;e of her Naval Strength, and Fo|reign Dominions: His Lord&s;hip &s;topp'd here a while, as if he expected I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething to it; but I de&s;ired him to go on, and if he plea&s;ed, to de&s;cend to Particulars.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he would give me an Ab&s;tract in Writing of what he had dige&s;ted as proper for the Queen to demand; but that he would be &s;o ju&s;t to me, as to let me know what was his own Thoughts only, and what was the Opinion of other People; for he would always tell me plainly, what he &s;aid of him&s;elf, and what he was directed to &s;ay; upon this, he pulled out two Schemes, and put them into my Hands.</P>
<P>I took them; but before I had opened them, I told him, that as I took the&s;e as private Papers, only to peru&s;e for my own Ob&s;ervation; &s;o he could not expect He and I &s;hould debate them, for that would be to enter upon the Negotiation directly; <HI>Well,</HI> &s;aid my Lord, <HI>but we may</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="157">
<HI>talk over them a little:</HI> I told him, I did not know whether it might be proper for us to go &s;o far or not; But this I would do with his Lord&s;hip, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That when I had read and con&s;idered the Demands, I would draw up Heads of a Propo&s;al on our Part, for him to make the &s;ame U&s;e of, as I did of his Papers: This fully &s;a|tisfied his Lord&s;hip, and thereupon I opened both his Papers, which I found Docketted thus.</P>

<P>I told his Lord&s;hip, on reading his two Papers, That his own was much the more Rea&s;onable, and Practicable of the Two. He An&s;wered, he did not &s;ee but they were both Practicable, if

the King of <HI>France</HI> thought fit to grant them; but that the Improbability of that had re&s;trained his Thoughts in &s;e|veral Demands that he had con&s;idered.</P>
<P>I told his Lord&s;hip I thought they had given their Thoughts a full Latitude, who had contrived the fir&s;t Paper, and that I hardly knew what more they could think of that had the lea&s;t &s;hew of Rea&s;on in it, or which they could de&s;ire we &s;hould Grant.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid my Lord, I know &s;everal Things we could ask, and which would be very u&s;eful to us. We could demand you &s;hould quit to us the French Colo|ny at <HI>Canada,</HI> and the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Que|beck,</HI> which is a Thing makes all our Northern Colonies very unea&s;y: We could demand the I&s;land of <HI>Martinico,</HI> and all your Settlements at St. <HI>Chri&s;to|phers;</HI> or any where el&s;e in <HI>America,</HI> where you daily give great Di&s;turbances to our Commerce, and a great many other things.

Oppo&s;ed by even the Con&s;ederates them|&s;elves, and create jealou&s;ies and unea|&s;ine&s;&s;es among all the People of Europe, and as to his Lord&s;hip's Articles of &s;e|perate Agreements with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> it was a Matter of private Intere&s;t, which would be proper to be moved when the Treaty was entred upon, and I dare to &s;ay the King of <HI>France</HI> would not oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>All this while we had been only in Confidence, di&s;cour&s;ing of what might, or might not be the Subject of a Treaty, when &s;uch a Thing might be &s;et on Foot; but we had not &s;o much as named the Manner of introducing a Treaty, which was the main Thing I came about, and which I watch'd an occa&s;ion to begin, and thought I had found it now; &s;o I moved it to him.

<P>His Lord&s;hip, told me, he &s;aw no|thing in this but what was highly rea|&s;onable,
<PB N="177" REF="176">
and he would repre&s;ent it ac|cordingly to the Queen.</P>
<P>We had now gone thro' every thing it was de&s;ir'd we &s;hould talk of in this manner; and I beg'd his Lord|&s;hip that he would give me &s;ome light into the main Difficulty which I had before me, <HI>(viz.)</HI> how I &s;hould make any Propo&s;al to the Mini&s;try; but I was very much &s;urpriz'd, when his Lord&s;hip told me it was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I know not how it came about, nor how they manage their Affairs in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> but certainly the Whigs had their Spyes nearer the Queen's Per&s;on, and Councils, than the&s;e Men imagin'd; for however, they gave me all the Cau|tions imaginable; and that on my &s;ide, there was not the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibility that any Su&s;picion could happen, yet &s;ome how or other the thing took Air; either the Jealou&s;y of the Whigs lead them to &s;u&s;pect it, or they charged the Mini&s;try with it upon a Pre&s;umption; or they found by the frequent &s;ecret Meetings of &s;ome particular Per&s;ons with the Queen; that &s;omething extraordinary was doing, and &s;o they gue&s;t at the re&s;t, or the thing it &s;elf was betray'd to them by one of tho&s;e who was intru&s;ted;
<PB N="178" REF="177">
however it was, I &s;ay, the thing took Air, and as the Whigs indu&s;triou&s;ly im|proved the Time, it was in a Moment &s;pread over the whole Kingdom, that, <HI>the New Mini&s;try were carrying on a pri|vate Negociation with France.</HI> There wanted not People al&s;o, who daily &s;pread the Report, with &s;uch Confi|dence, as if they had been privy to eve|ry Step that had been taken, tho' that they had any &s;cent of the thing it &s;elf as it &s;tood, I never &s;aw Cau&s;e to be|lieve. But certainly there is not a Nation in the World like <HI>England,</HI> for impo&s;ing on the People with fal&s;e Ru|mours, nor a People ea&s;ier to be im|po&s;ed upon, even by things which have not the lea&s;t probability, and indeed by &s;ome that are &s;carce rational.</P>
<P>This was the Rea&s;on why when I came to di&s;cour&s;e with my Ld&mdash;about the manner of Introducing a Treaty to the Mini&s;try, he an&s;wered, that it was impo&s;&s;ible? <HI>What then have we been doing my Lord,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>and what are we farther to do; I profe&s;s,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I know not what to &s;ay to one or other;</HI> and therewith <HI>he</HI> told me, how the thing was blown, and how it was in the Mouth of every one already, that they were making a &s;eperate Treaty
<PB N="179" REF="178">
with <HI>France;</HI> that there were private Agents here from the King of <HI>France;</HI> and in a Word, that the Treaty was concluded, and that they had made a &s;eperate Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Would to God,</HI> my Lord, &s;aid I, <HI>they were not mi&s;taken who &s;ay &s;o,</HI> I added, that I knew nothing would be more for the Service of <HI>Europe</HI> than that <HI>it were</HI> done, neither could any thing be more for their Advantage who report it; how|ever they might think they in&s;ult the Queen by the Rumour; and &s;peaking with &s;ome Warmth, I &s;aid, <HI>you have nothing to do,</HI> my Lord, <HI>but to go thro' with it, that they may find their Account, and rejoyce in that very thing which they pretend to complain off.</HI></P>
<P>You do not know our People, <HI>Sir, &s;ays my Lord,</HI> they would cut our Throats ju&s;t now, if they could come at the Knowledge of &s;uch a Thing.</P>
<P>I was very much concerned at his &s;aying this, <HI>and ask'd him</HI> what was to be done.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, that they mu&s;t put all to a &s;top for the pre&s;ent, and the Queen mu&s;t publickly di&s;own &s;uch a Thing,
<PB N="180" REF="179">
by a formal Speech to the Parliament, declaring that &s;he never intended, and was re&s;olved not to make a Seperate Peace, or any Peace at all, but in Con|junction with her Allies.</P>
<P>I reflected on this occa&s;ion with &s;ome Concern, upon the mi&s;erable Conditi|on of Princes who Govern by the Ad|mini&s;tration of Contending Parties, and are made to Speak, whether true or fal&s;e, what the Heads of tho&s;e Parties Dictate; <HI>now</HI> this way, <HI>now</HI> that way, and make all they are thus taught to &s;ay, pa&s;s as the re&s;ult of their own Thoughts, and agreeing with their own Judgment, which at the &s;ame time had <HI>bona fide</HI> no Concern in it what&s;oever.</P>
<P>However, in this Ca&s;e, they had ma|ny ways to &s;olve what the Queen was to &s;ay, as (1) This putting a real Stop to our pre&s;ent Negotiations, ju&s;tified her Maje&s;ty's $aying there was no &s;eperate Treaty on foot. (2) That part of what we had Propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> That in a Treaty <HI>Satisfaction &s;hould be given to all their Al|lies,</HI> &s;upported her Maje&s;ty <HI>in &s;aying,</HI> that &s;he would do nothing but <HI>in Participa|tion with all her Allies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="180">
Whether they ever put the Queen upon &s;aying the&s;e Things, either to her Parliament or Council, or otherwi&s;e I have not Ob&s;erved; perhaps the Con|&s;ternation wore off in &s;ome time, but it's certain, they were very much alarm|ed at the Di&s;covery of a <HI>Secret Negotia|tion;</HI> the rather, becau&s;e they began to look on one another with a kind of Jea|lou&s;y, which I know not how to di|&s;cribe; as every one was ready to charge the other with having betray'd the Se|cret, which notwith&s;tanding all that was &s;aid, I have Rea&s;on to believe, was never di&s;cover'd at all; <HI>and the rather, becau&s;e</HI> that when &s;ome time after this, a Per&s;on, who they had Confidence enough in, to &s;end over into <HI>France,</HI> to &s;et the Affair at work again, began to di&s;cour&s;e about the&s;e things at <HI>Paris,</HI> it appeared that Per&s;on had no know|ledge of what had pa&s;&s;ed, or that any Per&s;on had been in <HI>England</HI> on the &s;ame Subject. He knew it &s;eems, that &s;ome|thing had pa&s;t between the King and the Engli&s;h Court, but nothing at all of the manner, or of the Per&s;ons concerned.</P>
<P>I was now at a full &s;top for &s;ome Time, for the Mini&s;try in <HI>England</HI> were very uncertain in their Re&s;olutions, and of|ten times di&s;concerted in their Mea&s;ures,
<PB N="182" REF="181">
being embare&s;&s;ed with the Divi&s;ions a|mong their People, and the Inflamati|ons which their particular oppo&s;ers rai&s;ed again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Two things &s;upported them. (1) The &s;teadine&s;s of the Queen, guided by her own aver&s;ions to &s;ome of the other Peo|ple, and e&s;pecially by her Re&s;entments of the Affronts, which it was &s;aid had been offered her by &s;ome of the Women about her Per&s;on, and (2) the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Management of the Trea&s;urer, who be|ing now abroad again, after the Indi&s;po|&s;ition, occa&s;ioned by the Wound he had received from Count <HI>Gui&s;card,</HI> and pur|&s;uing his fir&s;t Schemes, had carried e|very Point in the Parliament, as well among the Deputies or Commons, as among the Nobility.</P>
<P>I waited 'till the&s;e Things took their Cour&s;e, and was concerned to &s;ee the Anxieties, in which the Courtiers very often appeared, e&s;pecially upon the Ni|ceties of any Vote which was coming on in the Parliament, even the Queen her &s;elf was &s;o concerned for fear things &s;hould &s;ome time or other mi&s;cary, that &s;ome of the Ladies about her, fre|quently reported, that it ca&s;t her into Fits; but if the re&s;t of the Mini&s;try
<PB N="183" REF="182">
were thus Anxious and Concerned, it was my &s;etled Ob&s;ervation, that the Trea&s;urer appeared always in the great|e&s;t Tranquility: When ever he went to the Queen, it was ob&s;erved, he left her Maje&s;ty chearful, tho' &s;he was to the la&s;t degree Chagrin, when he came.</P>
<P>It was never my Fate to have any &s;e|cret Conference with this Eminent Per|&s;on, during the fir&s;t of my being in <HI>England:</HI> I frequently &s;aw him, and had the Honour afterwards of entring into many Di&s;cour&s;es with him; but then not at all. He was ea&s;y of acce&s;s at all times; but it was much ea&s;ier to talk long with him upon trifling and com|mon Occa&s;ions, than to obtain a Mo|ment in &s;erious Bu&s;ine&s;s; in &s;o much, that I have heard of &s;ome who have waited upon him, by his own appoint|ment, on Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Greate&s;t Con|&s;equence, and have been entertained by him, from one Hour to another, on &s;ome Trifle, 'till at la&s;t the main Affair has been confin'd to a Minute or two, or perhaps deferred to another Oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>And yet at that very time he dige&s;ted all the Affairs of the Admini&s;tration,
<PB N="184" REF="183">
and &s;upported all tho&s;e difficult Schemes by him&s;elf, and that with &s;o much cheer|fulne&s;s and calmne&s;s, as was &s;urpri&s;ing to a Stranger: But it &s;eems, others, who afterwards &s;upplanted him with the Queen, charged him with meer Indo|lence and Negligence, and loaded him with Reproaches, for being unconcern|ed for all his Friends, after he had &s;e|cured his private Intere&s;ts. How it might be &s;ince I came from <HI>England,</HI> I know not; but when I was there, he was the la&s;t Re&s;ort in the utmo&s;t Exi|gencies, and if the Trea&s;urer was ea&s;y, every one was &s;o; the Reputation of his Conduct made every Man Serene, and if he Smiled, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that he knew his Mea&s;ures, and knew more then other Men. How they came to di&s;pute the Admini&s;tration with him afterwards, I know not; but I hear it is agreed on all Hands, that his Repu|tation declines, and that he is not &s;o well with the Queen as he u&s;ed to be; which, however I &s;hall not repine at, becau&s;e I had &s;ome Rea&s;on to think him le&s;s our Friend at La&s;t, than I had found him to be at Fir&s;t. If this is &s;o, I mu&s;t be content to be of their Opinion, who thought he was not &s;o Sincere with us, as he ought to have been, and that &s;ince the Peace <HI>(which he aim'd at for private</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="184">
<HI>Rea&s;ons)</HI> is obtained, he would be for making his Court to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Han|nover,</HI> at the Expence of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and of all his Friends.</P>
<P>Indeed he acted a mo&s;t wary Part in the Affair of the Peace; for he would &s;carce ever tran&s;act any thing him&s;elf, but put off every Man to Conferr with other People; contenting him&s;elf to be the Fir&s;t moving Cau&s;e of every Thing, without being really concerned in any of the Particulars: What the Rea&s;ons of the&s;e Prudentials were, perhaps Time may di&s;cover.</P>
<P><HI>However it was,</HI> I had not waited long, but the Nece&s;&s;ities of their own Circum|&s;tances, brought them to entertain &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es with me again; and I might ea&s;ily perceive the Affair of <HI>Peace</HI> was as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Mini&s;try in <HI>England,</HI> as it was to the King of <HI>France,</HI> or as it would have been, if the Duke of&mdash;had been encamped on the Plains of <HI>Compeign.</HI> I remember I had this very Contemplation on the Subject, one Evening, when I received Letters from <HI>France;</HI> wherein the King gave me expre&s;s Orders to wait quiet|ly, and pu&s;h nothing yet; for <HI>the&s;e were the Words added by the King's own</HI>

<P>The King's Opinion, which &s;eldom fail'd to be right, and which often times &s;hewed, that his Maje&s;ty made a better Judgment of things at a Di&s;tance, than his Mini&s;ters could do upon the Spot, <HI>pro|ved right here al&s;o;</HI> for, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> the Mini|&s;try finding nothing could Support them, but to quit their Hands of the War, and to have the King of <HI>France</HI> to be their Friend, <HI>took new Mea&s;ures,</HI> and my Lord&mdash;came to me one Evening, and told me, he de&s;ired to renew the Conferences with me, upon &s;ome very nice Points.

<P>That for this Rea&s;on, they were afraid of every Body, tho' they could Charge no body, and being very unea&s;y at the Rumour of a Treaty, they were obliged to give it over for a while; but that now they had re&s;olved to have the Ru|mour &s;pread on their &s;ide, while there was really nothing doing, that the Whigs might be amu&s;ed with Gene|rals, and be able to dive into no Par|ticulars.</P>

I cannot &s;ay, but as they were &s;tated in <HI>England</HI> at this time, this was a good Thought enough, and they pur&s;ued it as well; for they cau&s;ed Reports to be &s;pread in <HI>Holland,</HI> of a Negotiation pri|vately &s;et on foot in <HI>England,</HI> and that it was avowedly carried on by the Mini|&s;try, tho' they concealed the Per&s;ons they treated with: That there were two <HI>French</HI> Agents come to <HI>London,</HI> who appeared Publickly, tho' without any Character, and as the&s;e Rumours were continually Cultivated, they came at length to Report, That the &s;aid Nego|tiations went very well on, that the Peace advanc'd apace, and that it was expected, in a few Days, the Mini&s;try would declare them&s;elves upon it: Nor was this all; but they went on to give about privately, <HI>Schemes of the Peace it &s;elf,</HI> and Heads of the Preliminary Ar|ticles, quite remote from the real Things of which we had Di&s;cour&s;ed, and yet calculated to employ the Speculations of the People, and prompt them to di&s;cour&s;e frequently of the Thing.</P>
<P><HI>Nor was this all,</HI> but as all publick News flies from Shore to Shore, Letters were written every Po&s;t of it from <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and the Dutch were made unea&s;y to the la&s;t degree; nay &s;o perfectly was

the true De&s;ign covered, that an Agent the Court of <HI>France</HI> had at the <HI>Hague,</HI> wrote to the Court about it, as of a thing Certain, and the King him&s;elf &s;eem'd a little amu&s;ed about it, know|ing what Order I had, and how con|&s;tantly I had acquainted him with the full Stop we had been at for &s;ome time, and how I. had receiv'd his Ma|je&s;ty's Order to let it continue in that Po&s;ture for a while: But it was not many Days before I gave his Maje&s;ty the Eclarici&s;$ement in that Affair, and the King was exceedingly plea&s;ed with the Stratagem, and indeed his Maje&s;ty had rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It was the plea&s;ante&s;t thing in the World, to &s;ee how all the Confederates were alarmed at tho&s;e Rumours. The Envoys and Re&s;idents at <HI>London,</HI> were tormented with the Reproaches of their Ma&s;ters, who complained, that having &s;ent them to re&s;ide at the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court, to take care of their Intere&s;t, they &s;hould &s;it &s;till, and let a Negotiation of that Con&s;equence go on in &s;o publick and open a Manner, and give them no no|tice of any of the Particulars, nor &s;o much as write for further In&s;tructions, how to Act on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion. Upon this they came buzzing about the Court,

were Inqui&s;itive, Unea&s;y, and &s;o Im|portuning, that had it not been divert|ing to the Mini&s;try on another Account, it would have made them very unea&s;y.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mentioned, That not only the&s;e Rumours were rai&s;ed in <HI>Hol|land;</HI> but Letters written, as if coming from the <HI>Hague,</HI> were &s;ecretly &s;ent to the writers of the Publick <HI>Gazetts,</HI> and of News Prints in the City of <HI>London,</HI> who Printed openly in their Articles from the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Account given there of the Progre&s;s made in <HI>England,</HI> in the Secret Negotiations of Peace, and &s;ome times a Sketch of the Articles they were upon.</P>
<P>This being Printed in <HI>England,</HI> and no enquiry made of the Writer, to pu|ni&s;h him for &s;uch an open Publication, or to demand his Authority for it, left the People abroad, no room to doubt of the Truth of Fact. It is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cribe the Confu&s;ion the Whig Party were in, the Great ones, and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t Penetration, could make nothing of it, the Mini&s;try denyed it with all po&s;&s;ible Seriou&s;ne&s;s, as well they might; all the Vigilance, all the Ob&s;ervation, and Conjectures, all the Spies and Secret Attempts for a Di&s;co|very

in this matter came to nothing: The Court was &s;till and quiet, the Mi|ni&s;try appeared bu&s;ied upon other things; nor was there the lea&s;t appear|ance of any thing of this kind; <HI>for the truth was,</HI> that not one Step was all this while taken in the Matter.</P>
<P>When this had wearied the World &s;ome time, and as they thought long enough, my old Core&s;pondent gave me Notice, that he would meet me a|gain: When we were together, he be|gan merrily with this Part; Well Mon|&s;ieur, &s;aies he, <HI>How do you like this la&s;t Pu&s;h; my Lord,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>I think it is a Ma&s;ter|piece, and has done more than all that ever you have &s;aid or done before;</HI> all the Con|federates think you have made the Peace, I know nothing to do now, but to be &s;o kind to them, as to convince them, that they are not mi&s;taken: <HI>Let that be as it will,</HI> &s;ays my Lord, we have yet the Plea&s;ure of reproaching them with injuriou&s;ly charging us, when we have no Hand in any &s;uch thing, and if we bring their Predictions to pa&s;s, we only do that which they abu&s;ed us for, and we cannot, I think, do them a greater piece of Ju&s;tice, than to make good what they have with &s;o much Con|fidence, charged us with doing.</P>

I told his Lord&s;hip he knew the di&s;|po&s;ition of tho&s;e People better than I; that as to the Temper of Parties in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> I thank'd God, it was new to me, that we knew no &s;uch thing in <HI>France;</HI> that I had hear'd much in <HI>France,</HI> of the Happine&s;s of the People of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> on account of the Liberty they enjoy'd; but that I could not be per&s;wa|ded to be of the Opinion, that to have the People above Government, or with|out Government, was to be called Li|berty, or was capable of being thought Happine&s;s; that it was true, our Kings were Ab&s;olute, and in that Re&s;pect, might in their Language be call'd Ty|rants; but that I had rather be under any Tyranny, than that of Parties; that however, this was nothing to out Pur|po&s;e; that his Lord&s;hip knew what Part I had to Act, and that I was ready to take my Mea&s;ures from his Directi|ons.</P>
<P><HI>He Reply'd in &s;hort,</HI> Truly Sir&punc; I am very ill able to Direct you, proceed ju&s;t as you plea&s;e, we will do any thing as becomes us.</P>
<P>My Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if you give me Leave to appear in Publick, I'll wait on the Se|cretary of State, and produce my Creden|tials, and declare I come as an Envoy from

the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, to make her Ma|je&s;ty Propo&s;als of Peace, and demand an Au|dience.</P>
<P>We are very unhappy, <HI>&s;ays my Lord,</HI> That in &s;uch a Ca&s;e no Man dur&s;t be Civil to you; we &s;hould be obliged by meer Jealou&s;y, even to treat you as rudely as the Dutch did, and perhaps putting a Guard upon you, con|vey you to <HI>Dover,</HI> and &s;et you on &s;hore at <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P>What then mu&s;t we do my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> mu&s;t I go back to the King, and tell him the Queen will hearken to no Treaty, but that the War mu&s;t go on.</P>
<P>No Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> not that neither, we are re&s;olved to agree with you if we can; but we mu&s;t do it our own Way, and know not what way that is neither.</P>
<P>I mu&s;ed a while upon this, uncer|tain what to &s;ay, or to do: I con&s;idered that all this was not a matter of Cere|mony, but of Nece&s;&s;ity; that I &s;aw the Court was not only Sincere in the de&s;ign of Peace, but earne&s;tly for it, <HI>(and perhaps ruined without it)</HI> &s;o I de&s;ired my Lord to Con&s;ider 'till the next Even|ing, when we were to meet, and that I would do &s;o too.</P>

Accordingly at the next Meeting he told me with an Air of Satisfaction, that he had found out a Medium, <HI>which was this,</HI> that I &s;hould return to <HI>France,</HI> that a private Gentleman &s;hould come into <HI>France</HI> without any Character, but as a Foreigner to &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity; and that he &s;hould be de&s;ired there to bring a Me&s;&s;age from the Secretary of State, or from the King to her Ma|je&s;ty, &s;ignifying, <HI>THAT, his Majesty was inclined to make rea&s;onable Propo&s;als to the Queen of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>in behalf of her &s;elf and all her Allies, in order to prevent the further Effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian Blood, and to put an end to the Calamities of</HI> Europe: <HI>And that it was his Majesty's De&s;ire, that a Per&s;on &s;hould be admitted to come over to</HI> England <HI>to make &s;uch Propa&s;als.</HI></P>
<P>That upon receiving &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age, her Maje&s;ty would return for an&s;wer, that, <HI>as nothing was more her de&s;ire, than to bring this bloody War to an happy and lasting Peace,</HI> upon ju&s;t and honourable Conditions; <HI>&s;o &s;he was very glad to hear his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty was inclined to make rea&s;onable Propo&s;als for that end; that if any &s;uch were made to her Maje&s;ty, &s;he would Communicate them to her Allies; and &s;he hoped his Maje&s;ty would cau&s;e &s;uch Propo&s;als to be made, as</HI>
<PB N="195" REF="194">
<HI>might give a rea&s;onable Satisfaction to all the Allies, without which, her Maje&s;ty could do nothing in it:</HI> This was the re&s;ult of all our Conferences at that time, and this was no more or le&s;s, than the be|ginning of the Journey of the famous Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> who came into <HI>France</HI> upon this Errand; and although &s;ome Di&s;|cour&s;es were publi&s;h'd to the World, of a long Negociation had with him here; I believe tho&s;e Accounts to be Fictitious; at lea&s;t, there was neither room or occa|&s;ion for any &s;uch Negociations, as ever I knew, all things being &s;etled before he came, <HI>as above.</HI></P>
<P>That he was treated with Di&s;tinction, may be true, as al&s;o, that he had the Honour to wait upon the King, and was frequently with the Marqui&s;s de <HI>Torcy,</HI> and others, between whom, Di&s;cour&s;es on the Subject of a Peace, might be very natural to the Occa&s;ion, but that he ap|peared in a private Capacity, and could enter into no Treaty, I may &s;ay; no|thing of granting or denying, demand|ing or in&s;i&s;ting, could be in reality the Subject of their Di&s;cour&s;e; if Mr. <HI>Pr&mdash;r</HI> a&s;&s;umed the Liberty of making Demands, its what I never heard of in <HI>France,</HI> and what the Mini&s;try always di&s;own'd,
<PB N="196" REF="195">
and even rediculed, when I was after|wards in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s which that Gentleman appeared for in <HI>France,</HI> as far as I was acquainted with it, and as was con|certed with my Ld&mdash;as before; was no other than to come back, and let the Mini&s;try know in <HI>England,</HI> that having been in <HI>France</HI> on his private Occa&s;ions, for which he had obtain'd a pa&s;s at &s;uch a time from the Marqui&s;s de <HI>Torcy,</HI> and likewi&s;e another in <HI>England;</HI> he had been de&s;ired by the &s;aid Mon&s;ieur de <HI>Torcy,</HI> to deliver a Me&s;&s;age to her Ma|je&s;ty, or to her Secretaries of State by Word of Mouth, <HI>(viz.) that as the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King de&s;ired nothing more, than to contribute all his Endeavours to the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of a General Peace;</HI> His Ma|je&s;ty <HI>was inclined to make rea&s;onable Pro|po&s;als to the Queen, in behalf of her &s;elf, and all her Allies,</HI> &amp;c. as before, if her Maje&s;ty <HI>would plea&s;e to receive the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P>With this Me&s;&s;age it &s;eems Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> charged him&s;elf, and as the Story was told in <HI>England,</HI> returned thither Incog|nito, but was &s;topt at his Landing near <HI>Dover,</HI> and detain'd by a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officer, notwith&s;tanding he had a pa&s;s from the Secretaries of State.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="196">
Were it not that the People of <HI>Eng|land</HI> are the ea&s;ye&s;t to be impo&s;ed upon of any Nation in the Univer&s;e, when the Story that is told them &s;uits the part they e&s;pou&s;e, this Story could ne|ver have pa&s;t in the World; it was a very improbable thing, that an Officer of the Cu&s;toms, &s;hould &s;top a Per&s;on who had a pa&s;s in form from the Secreta|ry of State, and I was a&s;&s;ured afterwards, that this method of making publick, the bringing a Me&s;&s;age from <HI>France,</HI> was concerted by the Mini&s;try who knew be&s;t what purpo&s;es it was to &s;erve.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, <HI>when Mr.</HI> Prior <HI>was thus known to have been in</HI> France, <HI>it was no longer a Secret, that he had brought &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age, and perhaps this was the Rea&s;on of making his coming from thence Publick, to which it was al&s;o rea&s;onable to add, that the Queen had given &s;uch an An&s;wer as before, which An&s;wer, none could object again&s;t,</HI> (viz.) <HI>that,</HI> as nothing was more her Maje&s;ty's de&s;ire, then to bring this bloody War to an happy and la&s;ting Peace, <HI>upon ju&s;t and ho|nourable Conditions;</HI> &s;o &s;he was very glad to hear his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty was in|clined to make rea&s;onable Propo&s;als for that end; and if any &s;uch were made to her Maje&s;ty, &s;he would Communicate them to her
<PB N="198" REF="197">
Allies, and &s;he hoped his Maje&s;ty would cau&s;e &s;uch Propo&s;als to be made, as might give a Rea&s;onable Satisfaction to all the Allies; without which her Maje&s;ty could do nothing in it.</P>
<P><HI>It was added to this An&s;wer, in her Maje&s;ty's Name, THAT</HI> leave &s;hould be given to &s;uch Per&s;ons as his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;hould appoint, to bring &s;uch Propo|&s;als, which &s;hould be receiv'd <HI>AD REFEREN|DUM;</HI> but that &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould do no more, than deliver &s;uch Propo&s;als, and &s;hould not be admitted to enter into any Negotiati|ons thereupon, or on any other Subject what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Tran&s;actions, I received his Maje&s;ty's Leave to return to <HI>Paris,</HI> where I gave him a particular Account of all my Management, and had the Honour to have the King &s;ay, <HI>that it was to his Satisfaction.</HI> I entred, by his Or|der, in the next Place, upon &s;ome Expla|nations of the Preliminary Heads, which I had Di&s;cour&s;ed of with my Lord&mdash;, and took the King's Ob&s;ervations upon them in Writing, for my Government in <HI>England,</HI> for it was very &s;oon after my return to <HI>Paris,</HI> that the King let me know, that as &s;oon as he had the Queen's An&s;wer to the General Offer, of making
<PB N="199" REF="198">
Propo&s;als, I &s;hould go to <HI>England</HI> again, in order to carry the Propo&s;als Con|certed before. And,</P>
<P>This was not long, for as every thing was adju&s;ted before, what re|mained, was <HI>for Form &s;ake,</HI> to put the thing into a Regular way.</P>
<P>Malice has generally a &s;hrew'd Gue&s;s, and they who Speak wor&s;t, oftene&s;t <HI>Speak</HI> Truth. I could not but &s;mile when I came into <HI>England,</HI> and found the Propo&s;als were receiv'd in Form, Ad|ju&s;ted, and made Publick; <HI>of which I &s;hall &s;ay more pre&s;ently,</HI> to &s;ee tho&s;e People who oppo&s;ed the Mini&s;try there, enraged to the la&s;t degree; Satyrs were every where publi&s;hed, not on|ly again&s;t the Propo&s;als, but again&s;t the General Notion of making <HI>Peace</HI> at all; among which, this was Remark|able, and it is for the Sake of this, that I mention it, <HI>viz.</HI> That they upbraided the Mini&s;try with having kept a pri|vate Intelligence, <HI>Traytorous they call'd it,</HI> with the Court of <HI>France</HI> for a long time, contrary to their Engagements to the Allies, and Affirm'd confidently, that the pretence of receiving Propo&s;als from <HI>France,</HI> and entring into a Treaty, was a <HI>Comedy,</HI> or rather a <HI>Farce,</HI> which
<PB N="200" REF="199">
they put them&s;elves to the Trouble to Act, only to amu&s;e the People, that they might with as much Rea&s;on, and more Hone&s;ty, have told the Confe|derates, that the Queen having agreed with <HI>France,</HI> upon &s;uch Conditions for her &s;elf, and her Dominions, as &s;he thought fit, the Confederates were at Liberty to do the &s;ame, or let it alone, as they thought fit; that they had left them all at full liberty to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and get the be&s;t Terms that <HI>France</HI> thought fit to Grant.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that this was very true in the Sub&s;tance, tho' not in all the Particulars; but there were two things very odd in it. (1) How the&s;e People came to know this to be true, <HI>if they did know it,</HI> and (2) how they came to gue&s;s &s;o punctually, if they did not.</P>
<P>If they had really known it, I thought they would al&s;o have known &s;ome of the Particulars, which I never could perceive they had any intimation of, except the Time, and that they had to a Day, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the very Day when my Lord&mdash;and I exchanged our Pa|pers of Propo&s;als; but for other Circum|&s;tances, I never hear'd that they Named any, which one may &s;ay they would
<PB N="201" REF="200">
not fail to have done, if it had been in their Power.</P>
<P>However, this was the General News of the Whig Party in <HI>England,</HI> at the appearance of the Preliminaries, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Mini&s;try had made a Pri|vate and Seperate Peace with <HI>France,</HI> &s;everal Months before the Preliminaries appeared, and that the Allies were be|tray'd, the Publick Faith broken, the Honour of Treaties Violated in the breaking of the Confederacy, and the Grand Alliance di&s;&s;olved, and much more to that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I do not take Notice of the Affairs of that unquiet People, more than Nece&s;|&s;ity obliges; therefore, I &s;ay nothing of the Con&s;equences of the&s;e things to them&s;elves, what ever common Fame had charged them with, as unfair in this Matter, the Mini&s;try and the Queen her&s;elf were of another Opinion: <HI>Al&s;o,</HI> I am obliged to &s;ay, <HI>that I think they had Rea&s;on;</HI> for tho' it's true, that in Ca&s;e the Preliminaries were adju&s;ted, and a Treaty follow'd, the Queen had her Terms &s;ettled, as was afterwards the Ca&s;e, yet it was in her Maje&s;ty's Agree|ment, that tho&s;e Terms &s;hould not take Place, or her Maje&s;ty be Obliged
<PB N="202" REF="201">
by them, if the General Peace had not en&s;ued.</P>
<P>But this was to be allowed, as I No|ted already, that if the endeavours of the Queen, to bring the Allies to a Treaty, &s;hould prove ineffectual, and it &s;hould appear, that they &s;tood Ob&s;ti|nately out, again&s;t a Propo&s;al &s;o ju&s;t, as that of having all their Rea&s;onable Demands fully &s;atisfied by a Treaty, <HI>which would be indeed pu&s;hing the War, for love of it,</HI> that then the Queen would withdraw her&s;elf from the Alliance, and would adhere to the Terms agreed on for her&s;elf, and all &s;uch of her Allies as &s;hould think fit to accept the &s;ame. THIS was the <HI>Secret Article</HI> on our &s;ide, which I mentioned before, and which was &s;o Rea&s;onable, that it could not be Di&s;puted; e&s;pecially, &s;ince by that Se|perate Article, the Queen was made Judge of what &s;hould, or &s;hould not, be e&s;teemed a <HI>Rea&s;onable Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>This was that well known and hap|py Clau&s;e, which occa&s;ion'd the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops the next Year to withdraw from the Confederate Army in <HI>Flanders;</HI> and which together with their own ill Con|duct, and the &s;uperior Fortune of the <HI>French,</HI> brought the <HI>Dutch</HI> into <HI>the Peace,</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="202">
and in Con&s;equence of that, put an end to the whole War.</P>
<P>I was now order'd back into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> from whence, I had not been long ab&s;ent, and was preparing for my Jour|ney, when the King &s;ent me Orders to go to the Court of St. <HI>Germans,</HI> and take In&s;tructions there, for &s;ome things which I was to charge my &s;elf with in my Journey to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I obey'd and attended at St. <HI>Germans,</HI> the next Morning, and was no &s;ooner en|tred the Lodgings of the Queen Dowager of <HI>England,</HI> but the Earl of <HI>Middleton</HI> met me, and told me he had expected me &s;ome time, that the Queen had ask't for me twice; and that her Maje&s;ty was in her Clo&s;et, and he was ready to in|troduce me.</P>
<P>Being brought in, after having the Honour to ki&s;s her Maje&s;ty's Hand, &s;he was plea&s;ed to tell me, &s;he knew I was going to <HI>England</HI> upon a &s;ecret and important Negotiation; that &s;he wi&s;hed me good &s;peed, and was re&s;olved to expect that I would take care of her Affairs, and tho&s;e of her Son; adding, that my Lord <HI>Middleton</HI> would di&s;cour&s;e

<P>My Lord <HI>Middleton</HI> is a Per&s;on Emi|nent for nothing in the E&s;teem of the <HI>French,</HI> but his having been long an Exile with the late King of <HI>England:</HI> He is the unfitte&s;t for a prime Mini&s;ter of all the Men I have known, e&s;pecially, if what his own Country-Men &s;ay of him is true <HI>(viz.)</HI> that he is not able to give Council, and is too Proud to ask it; indeed, his po&s;itive and unruly Temper, has had the Misfortune to be the mo&s;t unguarded; and I have &s;een

him Expo&s;ing him&s;elf and his Schemes in the mo&s;t unaccountable manner; he has this Peculiar however attending him, to mortify the haughtye&s;t Temper in the World, <HI>(viz.) that nothing that was undertaken by his Advice ever &s;ucceeded.</HI> It was &s;aid he advi&s;ed his Ma&s;ter King <HI>James</HI> to make that mo&s;t di&s;honourable Attempt upon the Life of the Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> and that the Scheme for A&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation of that Prince, for which, Mon&s;. <HI>Granval</HI> was Executed in <HI>Flanders,</HI> was of his forming, <HI>which if true,</HI> would add very little to his Fame; that Con|trivance being as fooli&s;h in its Scheme, as it was Villainous in its Practice; a thing ju&s;tly abhorr'd by all Chri&s;tian Princes, tho' again&s;t their wor&s;t Enemies. I could give innumerable In&s;tances of the weake&s;t things in the World, which he put that unfortunate Prince upon, which cau&s;ed him nece&s;&s;arily to Mi&s;|carry: If he had any &s;hare in the Coun|cils of that King, before he &s;o prepo&s;to|rou&s;ly left his own Kingdoms, that would be a Rea&s;on to me, why I &s;hould the le&s;s wonder at many things which were done, that no Wi&s;e Prince ever did before him.</P>

I &s;tuck here, but was obliged to be even rude with him, before I could get from him, for all my Arguments were of no weight with him.

<P>The King was exceedingly mov'd when I told him this Story, and expre&s;|&s;ing his dete&s;tation of the Propo&s;al, told me, I &s;hould go no more to St. <HI>Ger|mains,</HI> which I was very glad of, tho' I did charge my &s;elf afterwards, with his Maje&s;ty's Leave, with the other Branch of that Affair, as far as could con&s;i&s;t with the Work I had in hand, and Pro|po&s;ed to render her Maje&s;ty &s;ome Ser|vice, and her Son al&s;o, only as far as moving the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and her Mini&s;ters, to e&s;pou&s;e that Intere&s;t, for the Time, after her Maje&s;ty and her Heirs, of which I &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to &s;ay more.</P>
<P>This breaking off &s;o ab&s;olutely, might, for ought I know, be the Rea|&s;on of the &s;ending the Abbot <HI>Gualtier</HI> over in &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion, to Negoti|ate that Affair; with whom I had &s;e|veral
<PB N="208" REF="207">
Di&s;cour&s;es, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland:</HI> But as it was a Negotiation, which had very little Probability in it, as he de&s;igned to manage it, &s;o I en|deavoured to concert, as little as po&s;&s;i|ble with him, any Mea&s;ures about it; nor can I give any Account &s;uitable to the Exactne&s;s of my Method, of the &s;everal Con&s;ultations which he had a|bout that Affair, which makes me take le&s;s Notice of it here, than otherways I would have done.</P>
<P>The Abbot, as I was informed, had per&s;waded him&s;elf to believe, that if he could get admittance to a Pri|vate Conference with the Queen; I &s;ay he fancied, if he had but even Liberty of Speaking his Mind to her Maje&s;ty, tho' there were others Pre&s;ent, he &s;hould be able to give her &s;uch an Ac|count of the dying Expre&s;&s;ions of her Father, the late King of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch Te&s;timonies of the pre&s;ent King <HI>James</HI>'s being really his Son, and of his pro|te&s;ting his Satisfaction of his being born of the Queen's Body, that he was &s;a|tisfied would touch the Queen in &s;o &s;en|&s;ible a manner, as that her Maje&s;ty would be the le&s;s able to re&s;i&s;t the Argu|ments he would bring afterwards to Prove, that &s;he could never enjoy the
<PB N="109" REF="208">
Kingdom of Heaven, without She delivered up the Crown to him <HI>who&s;e Right it is.</HI></P>
<P>I do confe&s;s, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear the Abbot <HI>Gualtier</HI> &s;hould Speak thus, who is an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick of the Catholick Church, &s;eeing it had been fir&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary for him to have acknowledg'd, that her Maje&s;ty might enjoy the Kingdom of Heaven, while &s;he continued out of the Catholick Church, altho' &s;he had with re&s;pect to the Ca&s;e in Hand, re&s;tored the Crown to her Brother; and that therefore, a Propo&s;al of that kind, was fit for none to in&s;i&s;t upon, but a Pro|te&s;tant, or Hugonet, who&s;e Arguments would not have been liable to the &s;ame Exception: But I had no rea&s;on to have made that Difficulty, if I had con&s;ider'd who the Propo&s;al came from, and that &s;ome Men are &s;o Opinionated, that they will &s;upport their own Notions, tho' with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>However, as the <HI>Abbot Gualtier</HI> was charged with other Negotiations than this, when he was in <HI>England,</HI> he had room, I &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;atisfie him&s;elf, that the Method propo&s;ed, <HI>if he did propo&s;e it,</HI> was impracticable enough. I have hear'd indeed, that he did make the Attempt; but that there was not a Man among&s;t
<PB N="210" REF="209">
the Per&s;ons of Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, who he had conver&s;ed with, that would bear &s;o much as to &s;tay in the Room with him, while he talked of it; much le&s;s undertake to give him an opportunity to move it to the Queen, nor indeed could he expect they &s;hould: But thus it often is, when our Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks turn Polititians.</P>
<P>I was now ju&s;t ready to go over to <HI>England;</HI> the Probability of Succe&s;s in my Negotiations, encrea&s;ed every Day, and the Mar&s;hal <HI>Tallard</HI> pre&s;t the King by Letters every Po&s;t, to make a begin|ning, for that the Mini&s;try in <HI>England,</HI> &s;eemed in a Condition, &s;omething ten|ding to a Cri&s;is, and that they would very &s;oon be pa&s;t help, or in a Circum|&s;tance above the Occa&s;ion of it; which would be equally prejudicial to his Ma|je&s;ty's Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Before I went, the King &s;ent for me, and receiving me with an uncommon Chearfulne&s;s, <HI>Me&s;nager,</HI> &s;ays his Ma|je&s;ty, I am putting the Greate&s;t Piece of Confidence in you, that it is po&s;&s;ible for any Man to be tru&s;ted with, and you car|ry the Fortune of <HI>France</HI> in your Hand: If you manage this Point well, you &s;erve me and &s;ave your Country; I need

give you no other In&s;tructions than you have already, except in two Things.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The other Thing, <HI>continued his Ma|je&s;ty,</HI> relates to the young King here: It will be acceptable to me, if you can render him any Service; and e&s;pe|cially, if you can bring the new Mini&s;try and the Queen into his In|tere&s;t, and make way for his being placed on the Throne, after the Queen; but remember, if the main Affair of the Treaty requires it, <HI>and the Queen in&s;i&s;ts upon it,</HI> you mu&s;t give him up to his better Fortunes, we mu&s;t not be ruined on his Account,</Q> <HI>entender Vous,</HI> &s;ays the King twice togeter, <HI>do you under|&s;tand me;</HI> I bowed, and told his Ma|je&s;ty, I perfectly under&s;tood his Mind, and thought al&s;o, that I &s;aw his Intere&s;t in that particular, and would make both the Rule of my Conduct.

Maje&s;ty, that I might have frequent In&s;tructions, as any thing offered, which the King told me &s;hould be done, and giving me his Hand to ki&s;s, di&s;mi&s;s'd me&punc; and I &s;et out Po&s;t the &s;ame Even|ing for <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P>I arrived at <HI>London,</HI> about the begin|ning of <HI>September,</HI> 1711, but did not appear publickly, 'till &s;ome days after; however, I &s;ignified to my old Corre&s;|pondent, my Lord&mdash;, That I was arrived, and that I made no Que&s;tion, I was furni&s;hed &s;ufficiently, to Con|clude the Great Work, to the Satis|faction, as well of the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the King my Ma&s;ter, as of all the Lovers of Peace in both Nati|ons, and that I left it to his Lord&s;hip, to give Directions, in what Manner, and at what Time, I &s;hould make my &s;elf known.</P>
<P>My Lord detained the Gentleman I &s;ent with this Me&s;&s;age, near two Hours, which afterwards, as I under&s;tood, was 'till he had di&s;cour&s;ed with another Per|&s;on, and then, taking him into his Coach, came directly to me.

<P><PB N="213" REF="212">
We immediately enter'd upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and I &s;hewed him the Heads of our Propo&s;als, both as we left 'em in our former Di&s;cour&s;e, and as they &s;tood now; that I had brought them over new Mo|dell'd, wherein &s;ome things were added, again&s;t my Inclination, and &s;uch, as I told the King expre&s;sly, would not go down in <HI>England,</HI> and were indeed not fit to be Propo&s;ed; <HI>whereof, one was</HI> re|lating to the Article mentioned already, <HI>viz.</HI> That if the Confederates &s;hould &s;tand out ob&s;tinately again&s;t the Treaty, notwith&s;tanding that the Satisfaction his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;hould offer to them, was found to be Rea&s;onable, <HI>that then Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould withdraw from the &s;aid Confederates, and would adhere to the Terms adju&s;ted for her&s;elf,</HI> &amp;c. To this, &s;ome of our wi&s;er Heads in <HI>France</HI> had prevailed with the King, to add as fol|lows, <HI>viz. That if after her Maje&s;ty had &s;o withdrawn from the</HI> Alliance, &amp;c. <HI>if the &s;aid Confederates did not come into the Ge|neral Peace, within one Year; but continued to carry on the War; that then</HI> the Queen <HI>&s;hould act with all her Forces, in Conjun|ction with his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, to oblige them to accept of the Rea&s;onable Satis|faction afore&s;aid.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="213">
My Lord Complained of this Arti|cle, as well for the Sub&s;tance of it, as the manner of its being put in, and told me, it was not only in vain to offer it, but that it was needle&s;s, and of no Values, and that it could be of no Service to us in <HI>France</HI> to have it, nor any Injury to leave it out; but that on the Contrary, all we could Propo&s;e would fall in of Cour&s;e, without it, and yet, that <HI>to offer it,</HI> would be <HI>to put an End to the whole Treaty;</HI> for that not only they were a&s;&s;ured the Queen would not hear it, but that no Mini&s;ter of State dur&s;t Propo&s;e it to her, and if any one &s;hould advi&s;e the Queen to &s;uch a thing, he would be certain, in the next Parlia|ment, to be Voted an Enemy to his Country, and perhaps &s;ent to the Tow|er; <HI>which is the Ba&s;tile in that Country.</HI></P>

Who it was &s;hould owe me &s;uch an ill Turn, I could not Imagin; but it gave me a great unea&s;ine&s;s for &s;ome Days.</P>
<P>In the mean time, my Lord and I went into the detail of this Clau&s;e; fir&s;t he fell foul on the Article it &s;elf, <HI>and tho' in re&s;pectful Terms,</HI> told me, it was ab|&s;urd, weak, and not fit to be offered, he was pleas'd in Compliment to tell me, that he dur&s;t &s;ay, I had no hand in putting it into the Propo&s;als, and that they who did it, &s;hew'd they knew lit|tle of the Affairs of <HI>England,</HI> much le&s;s as they were &s;tated at that time; that it was enough to rai&s;e a Mobb all over the Kingdom again&s;t the Mini&s;try, the Rage of whom they &s;hould be very ill able to with&s;tand, nay, <HI>and as things now &s;tood;</HI> the Queen her&s;elf might not be able to protect them, that I was to con&s;ider the different Intere&s;ts of the two Nations, as to Religion, and how warm the Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> always were on that head; what a handle it would give on that account to the Whigs, and how popu|lar they would make their Oppo&s;ition be to the Mini&s;try by that one Clau&s;e, that in a word, it would bring the Com|mon People as one Man into the other Intere&s;t, bring the Mini&s;try into the ut|mo&s;t

<P>Be&s;ides he told me he thought it was entirely u&s;ele&s;s, and to no manner of purpo&s;e, for that nothing was more cer|tain than this, that if the Confederates ab&s;olutely rejected a Treaty, and re&s;olv'd to carry on the War, it would fir&s;t or la&s;t bring <HI>England</HI> into the War, or bring <HI>France</HI> out of a Condition to want A&s;&s;i&s;tance; for fir&s;t, if the Confederates were Victorious, it could not be expected that they would be long, before they &s;hew'd their Re&s;entment at <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain</HI> would be obliged to pre|vent the Ruin of <HI>France,</HI> lea&s;t they &s;hould be forc'd to come to Blows with the Con|derates for de&s;erting them: On the other Hand, if <HI>France</HI> having the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Forces withdrawn from their Enemies, &s;hould be Victorious, the Rea&s;on of the Article would cea&s;e; the&s;e Arguments

<P>I had little to do now in <HI>England,</HI> but to wait the I&s;&s;ue of this great Tran&s;action, and encourage the Par|ties that had thus &s;erv'd us; and here I had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee, how the Ene|mies of <HI>France,</HI> not in <HI>England</HI> only, but every where el&s;e, raged at this Ne|gotiation: I &s;ay I had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee it, becau&s;e I found they began to be &s;en&s;ible, the Mini&s;try in <HI>England</HI> were now powerfully &s;upported by <HI>France,</HI> and would be able to carry their Point, in &s;pight of all the Oppo&s;ition that could be made.</P>
<P>My Bu&s;ine&s;s was to encourage the Parties; I mean at Court, for indeed
<PB N="227" REF="226">
&s;ome times they were ready to Di&s;pond. The Rage, that the Whig Party &s;hew'd, upon the Publication of the Prelimi|naries; was not only terrible in it|&s;elf, but grew Popular, and they pro|mi&s;ed them&s;elves to have them Cen&s;ur'd in Parliament.</P>
<P>Libels and Satyrs flew like Mu&s;quet-Balls in a Field-Battle, upon the <HI>Preli|minaries;</HI> they were Canva&s;&s;ed, Banter'd, and Expo&s;itions upon them publi&s;hed, as every Man plea&s;ed; but it all came too late. <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> That <HI>Spain</HI> was given up to King <HI>Philip,</HI> and that the Crown which was the occa&s;ion of the War, was left by the&s;e Articles to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon;</HI> that the War carried on ano|ther Year, would have humbled <HI>France,</HI> and was ended now, meerly to pre&s;erve about five Men in the publick Admini|&s;tration; that all the Queen's former Promi&s;es, Speeches, and Declarations, were un&s;aid, broken, and contradicted, and a Thou&s;and Reproaches were ca&s;t daily on the Court, for this, as they call'd it, Perfidious Carriage.</P>
<P>I had nothing to &s;ay to all this, it was none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s; the more of it was true, the better Bargain I had made: But by it may be &s;een what
<PB N="228" REF="227">
Men in Po&s;ts in the Government, will on all &s;ides do, to get in, or to keep in their Places.</P>
<P>I Laugh'd at the People that were out, and told &s;ome of them, whom I happen'd to &s;ee, that the Mini&s;try laid all the Fault on them; for pu&s;hing them on &s;uch de&s;perate Mea&s;ures; that they ought to have known by them&s;elves, that Par|ties, when uppermo&s;t, will not &s;tick at wor&s;e Things than the&s;e, to keep them&s;elves up, and the other down; that if the Mini&s;try had done any thing to the Prejudice of the Queen's Intere&s;t, the Whigs were in the Fault, for refu&s;ing to &s;erve at fir&s;t, when all the&s;e things were unthought of; and that if they had continued in their Po&s;ts, as they might have done, the charge had not been Univer&s;al, and the Mini&s;try had not been run to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity which now they complain'd of.</P>
<P>I had no mind to di&s;pute the&s;e Things, my Bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;it &s;till, and &s;ee what pa&s;&s;ed, and let the thing go on; the Parliament approach'd, and great were the Expectations on both &s;ides, nor were the Mini&s;ters without apprehen|tions; but the exqui&s;ite Conduct of the Trea&s;urer, in the management of the
<PB N="229" REF="228">
Parliament, was never to be equal'd in any Place in the World.</P>
<P>It was now time that I &s;hould with|draw, or at lea&s;t &s;eem to do &s;o, for I had no more publick Bu&s;ine&s;s&punc; in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> it was therefore thought very proper to take a formal Leave, that it might not be &s;uppo&s;ed I was any long|er there; accordingly I made my Vi&s;its in form to the Trea&s;urer, the Se|cretaries of State, &amp;c. and had the Ho|nour to have a Secret Audience of the Queen, in her Clo&s;et, who received me very favourably; I Felicitated her Maje&s;ty upon the happine&s;s of her Reign, and that Heaven would Honour her upon the Occa&s;ion of <HI>Giving Peace to Europe:</HI> I a&s;&s;ured her of the E&s;teem and Friend&s;hip of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and that for the future it &s;hould be in her Maje&s;ty's Brea&s;t, in Con|junction with the Greate&s;t King in the World, to give Laws to Mankind. I concluded, with letting her Maje&s;ty know, that the King my Ma&s;ter, would think him&s;elf further Obliged, if her Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to allow the Mar&s;hal <HI>Tallard,</HI> who had now been a long while Pri&s;oner of War, to return to <HI>France</HI> upon his Parole; He return|ing to his Confinement, if the Peace
<PB N="300" REF="229" MS="Y">
was not made, and that his Maje&s;ty o|bliged him&s;elf, the Mar&s;hal &s;hould per|form as became a Pri&s;oner of War, and a Man of Honour. Her Maje&s;ty An|&s;wered, it &s;hould be granted, &s;aid a great many obliging things to me, and I had my Di&s;mi&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not material to &s;ay here, whe|ther the Queen knew at <HI>that time,</HI> that I was not to go away, or that I went away for a while, and came again; it is &s;ufficient, that even Mon&s;.&mdash;who was with me in all the Publick Part of my Negotiation, knew nothing, and that therefore, I not only went back with him to <HI>Dover,</HI> but embark'd with him, and landed at <HI>Calais;</HI> but telling him I had a Vi&s;it to make at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> I gave him the &s;lip, and after a few Days &s;tay in <HI>France;</HI> in which, however, I &s;aw the King in Private, and gave him an Account of what was done, I return'd immediately to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> where I kept my &s;elf incognito, ex|cept to &s;ome particular Per&s;ons, of whom further Mention &s;hall be made pre&s;antly.</P>
<P>The Trea&s;urer had kept back the Parliament, 'till the <HI>Dutch</HI> were brought into the Treaty, and then they
<PB N="301" REF="230" MS="Y">
were allow'd to meet: The Queen came as u&s;ual, to open their A&s;&s;embly; but far from coming to ask their Con&s;ent, or move them to approve what &s;he had done. She came to tell them in Tri|umph, That <HI>at length, notwith&s;tanding the Arts of tho&s;e who delighted in War, both Place and Time were appointed, for opening a Treaty for a General Peace:</HI> The&s;e are the Words of her Speech.</P>
<P>Contrary to the Fears of the Court, and the hopes of the Enemies of <HI>France,</HI> the Trea&s;urer managed with &s;uch a happy Dexterity, that not one Vote, in either Hou&s;e, ever went again&s;t him, or again&s;t any thing that he ever pu&s;h'd at: One Remarkable Thing, which I think worth a Place among my Ob&s;ervations, was this; it is u&s;ual, after the Queen opens the A&s;&s;embly with a Speech, that the Deputies of the Commons pre&s;ent an Addre&s;s back to the Queen; wherein they generally thank her for her Speech, recapitulating the Heads, and giving a&s;|&s;urances of their ready and dutiful Com|pliance with her Maje&s;ties Commands.</P>
<P>When this Addre&s;s came to be moved in the Hou&s;e, and the Deputies Debated the &s;everal Heads particularly that Point of thanking her Maje&s;ty for the A&s;|&s;urances
<PB N="232" REF="231">
&s;he had given them, of her Concern for the good of all the Allies, in the en&s;uing Treaty.</P>
<P>The Whigs moved to have the&s;e Words included in the Addre&s;s, <HI>And that the Hou&s;e did not doubt, but care would be taken, that</HI> Spain <HI>and the</HI> Indies <HI>&s;hould not be left in the Hands of any Branch of the Hou&s;e of</HI> BOURBON. This was promi&s;ed in our Preliminaries; but the Mini&s;try, who were our Plenipotentiaries, <HI>as I may call them,</HI> carried this again&s;t the Whigs, by a Majority of 126 Voices.</P>
<P>This was te&s;tifying &s;ufficiently to the World, that they had given up <HI>Spain,</HI> and was the &s;ame Thing, as if they had Proclaimed King <HI>Philip</HI> at the Gate of their A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>It was a particular Satisfaction to me, when a private Agent, that I had employ'd to bring me an Account what they were upon, and how it was like to go, came and told me that he could get me into the Hou&s;e, to hear the Debates that &s;hould happen upon that Occa&s;ion; I went accordingly, and was thru&s;t in by a Gentleman, whom I
<PB N="233" REF="232">
knew not, who followed, and placed him&s;elf next me.</P>
<P>It was my Misfortune, That I did not under&s;tand enough of the Language, to take in the ju&s;t Ideas, that what was &s;aid by particular Per&s;ons would have given me; but the &s;trange Gentle|man &s;upplied me in many Ca&s;es, telling me in French the Names of every Per|&s;on that Spoke, and often times what they &s;aid.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance of this A&s;&s;em|bly is Maje&s;tick and Awful, and much repre&s;ents the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim. The Pre&s;ident, whom they called Speaker, is Seated on a Throne, at the upper part of the Room: At his Feet Sat &s;e|veral of the Secretaries, or writing Clerks, with large Books, entring down Minutes, of whatever was Concluded. I ob&s;erved they took no Minutes of what was Spoken, tho' &s;ome times, &s;ome of the Deputies &s;poke very long, which made me enquire, how it happened, that frequently tho&s;e Speeches were made publick in Print; but I was In|formed they are generally fal&s;e, being re-compo&s;ed from the Fragments, that &s;ome Gentlemen bring away in their Memories, and &s;o put together, as the
<PB N="304" REF="233" MS="Y">
Occa&s;ion, and the Party &s;eem'd to Di|rect, mo&s;t of them being made up by the Invention of the <HI>Libel-Writers</HI> in the Town. I wondred much, that the Per|&s;ons them&s;elves would permit &s;uch things to be Impo&s;ed upon them, as well as upon the Word in their Names; but was told, that the Pre&s;s was open, as well as the Mouths of the People in <HI>England,</HI> to Print and Say, all &s;orts of injurous Things, with Impu|nity; and that the Gentlemen were &s;o u&s;ed to it, that they took little or no Notice of it; be&s;ides, the&s;e Speeches, when publi&s;hed, were compo&s;ed &s;o much to the advantage of the Speakers, and they were made to Argue &s;o much hap|pier, to Speak &s;o much finer, and in &s;o much Politer a Stile, than they ever did, or were capable to do; that they were content with the Injury, for the &s;ake of the Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>While I was in the Hou&s;e, they were very hot upon the point, I ju&s;t now mentioned about <HI>Spain,</HI> whether it &s;hould be put into their Addre&s;s to the Queen; there were five or &s;ix of the Friends of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> who &s;truggled ob&s;tinately to have it in, and alledged, that it was the main end for which the War had been fir&s;t declared,
<PB N="305" REF="234" MS="Y">
the Confederacy made, and the Money for carrying on the War rais'd; but I ob&s;erved the other Party did but laugh at them, knowing they had plurality of Voices again&s;t them; for it &s;eem'd to me, that altho' long Speeches were often made, they were little minded, but if a debate held long, the Deputies would go out to the Taverns and Eating Hou&s;es, and &s;et Men to call them when the time came to pa&s;s their Votes, not regarding what Arguments were u&s;ed on one &s;ide or other; &s;o that I &s;aw evidently things were then carryed, not by Rea&s;on and Arguments, but by Number.</P>
<P>I came a way well plea&s;ed with what I had &s;een, and failed not to put it in a Po&s;t&s;cript to the King, that I had ju&s;t now the Plea&s;ure of felicitating his Ma|je&s;ty, upon the mo&s;t agreeable and unex|pected event that had happened in all our Affair, and that I thought the Intere&s;t of his Maje&s;ty and his Family, was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed now by the Parliament, and that they had voted for King <HI>Philip</HI> effectu|ally.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved from this time, that the Whigs began to di&s;pair, and that they were in the greate&s;t Rage imaginable at their new Mini&s;try; for finding that
<PB N="236" REF="235">
the Court were able by Numbers to carry &s;uch a Vote as this, which indeed &s;eem'd to be much again&s;t the popular Notions which the People in that Nation had always entertained of the War, but too apparent that nothing could &s;tand in their way.</P>
<P>The more they were enraged, the more I &s;aw rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed, for now, I &s;aw thro' the dark Cloud which had for &s;o long together hung over the <HI>French</HI> Nation, threatning a total Eclyp&s;e of her Glory, if not a general de&s;truction of her Monarchy and Government; but now I &s;aw her deliverance ri&s;e from tho&s;e very Enemies, and in that Nation which we dreaded mo&s;t.</P>
<P>But not to dwell too long here, this Vote being pa&s;s'd, the Con&s;equence was, that the Terms of Peace was left entirely to the Queen; it &s;eems the Crown claims the right in <HI>England</HI> of making Peace and War, the People re|&s;erving only the Pur&s;e, which tho' it is indeed a great Article, yet in the Ca&s;e I am &s;peaking of, it &s;erved very well to our purpo&s;e, and in this di&s;pute, it was urged home to the Deputies, that all the&s;e things ought to be left to the
<PB N="237" REF="236">
Queen, which was all the Mini&s;ters wanted.</P>
<P>It is true, that at the &s;ame time a like re&s;erve about <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> was offered by the Whigs in the Hou&s;e of Lords, where the Court lo&s;t it by one Voice; but they valued not that, it being in their Power to &s;ecure the Votes of that part of the Parlia|ment, by creating, and giving Votes to as many as they plea&s;ed, which was done by advice of the Trea&s;urer, to the Number of Twelve at a time. It gave me frequent occa&s;ions to Reflect upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, when I &s;aw how they flattered them&s;elves with Notions of great Privileges, which they enjoyed, and of their being more than other Na|tions &s;ecure of their Liberties, which to me &s;eem'd a meer Chymera, &s;eeing I found that Court managements were come to &s;uch a degree of Perfection in <HI>England,</HI> that all the Liberties they &s;o much boa&s;ted to enjoy, were often en|tirely at the Mercy of their Princes, and that who ever reign'd, and what&s;oever Party had the A&s;&s;endant with the So|vereign, they never need want a Parlia|ment to do their Bu&s;ine&s;s, whether the de&s;ign might be to Pre&s;erve tho&s;e Li|berties, or to De&s;troy them; two ways
<PB N="308" REF="237" MS="Y">
I found they have, in that quarrelling divided Nation, to do this <HI>(viz.)</HI> Money in the lower Hou&s;e, or Hou&s;e of De|puties; and Prerogative in the higher Hou&s;e; by the fir&s;t, if the Court was willing to &s;pare enough of it, to bribe and influence Elections, they have ob|tained &s;uch Members to be cho&s;en, as were of their own Party, and who get|ting in by Corruption, would, no doubt, Act by corrupt Principles; and by the other it was in their Power as a Pre|rogative, to make not 12 Voices only, but 12 &s;core at a time, and as of|ten as they found cau&s;e: All which con&s;ider'd, it appeared to me that it is owing to Fate, and the good di&s;po&s;itions of their Princes, more than the &s;tability of their Con&s;titution, that they are not long &s;ince fallen into a wor&s;e Condition of Bondage, than what they think ours to be in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the Hi&s;tory of the Affair in hand, which will illu&s;trate the&s;e Ob&s;ervations; I found the Peace or Treaty now propo&s;ed was doubtle&s;s of the utmo&s;t weight to the Engli&s;h Na|tion, and on the management whereof, depended the whole ballance of Power in <HI>Europe;</HI> and yet how ea&s;ily did they give it up to the Conduct of a Woman;
<PB N="309" REF="238" MS="Y">
and a Woman thro' the goodne&s;s of her Di&s;po&s;ition, not the lea&s;t ea&s;y of all the Women in the World, to be impo&s;ed up|on by her Servants.</P>
<P>In the Conduct of her Maje&s;ty's Par|ticular, I al&s;o found rea&s;on to make one Ob&s;ervation, which may be of u&s;e to us in <HI>France (viz.)</HI> that goodne&s;s of Di&s;po|&s;ition is not always a Vertue, or at lea&s;t, is not the &s;afe&s;t Vertue in a Prince; our Augu&s;t Monarch is a mo&s;t hap|py Example of this; who by the inimitable Fire of his Temper, govern'd at the &s;ame Time by an unexampled Sagacity, Wi&s;dom, and Prudence, has maintained &s;uch an Authority in all his Admini&s;trations, that his Mini&s;ters of State have been entirely kept within the bounds of their Duty; tho' they have been capable of advi&s;ing, yet have they never been capable of impo&s;ing upon their Sovereign.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try had now obtained their end, and the Preliminaries being di&s;|patch'd abroad by the Queen's Orders, means were made u&s;e of to bring the Allies into a Treaty, and to ap|point time and place for that purpo&s;e; this was managed with a great deal of Addre&s;s in foreign Parts, e&s;pecially in
<PB N="240" REF="239">
<HI>Holland</HI> by the Trea&s;urer's Direction, and the Applications of &s;uch Agents as were employed there; and yet &s;o great was the ob&s;tinacy of the Whigs in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;uch Intere&s;t had they in her Allies, that they made it very difficult to bring forward the Negotiation, and had not the ill Succe&s;s in the Field, reduced the States-General to the nece&s;&s;ity of com|plying with the Queen, it had perhaps not been brought to pa&s;s, no not tho' the Queen &s;ent them word, &s;he would think her &s;elf di&s;engag'd from all former Alliances, and actually did &s;eperate her Troops from them in the Field: But when all the&s;e high Mea&s;ures fail'd, fate and the glorious Arms of the King of <HI>France</HI> brought it all to Perfection, to the Eternal Honour of the Management of the mo&s;t Politick, as well as power|ful Prince in the World, as will appear in the &s;equel of this Relation.</P>
<P>The Affair &s;eem'd now tran&s;ported from <HI>England,</HI> and our Eyes were fixt upon the <HI>Dutch;</HI> I liv'd in <HI>London,</HI> as a Per&s;on out of Employment, and that had nothing to do there but to wait my Ma&s;ters Orders, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be, either to continue or to return, as the An&s;wers of the Confederates, were
<PB N="241" REF="240">
or were not &s;uited to the Grand de&s;ign in View.</P>
<P>This time I took to make the attempt in the be&s;t manner I could, to &s;erve, or at lea&s;t to &s;ee what Service I could render to the Court of St. <HI>Germans,</HI> the King having be&s;ides what he had &s;aid to me at parting, given me his Command twice afterwards, to let him know if there was room to do any thing in that Affair.</P>
<P>I had no way for this, but to enter into a Confidence with my fir&s;t Corre&s;pon|dent on this Head, which I found was to be done with the utmo&s;t caution, and I cannot but remark, that he very hand|&s;omly avoided the touching that Point in &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es which I offered, that look't towards it, tho' at a great di&s;tance, but at length I re&s;olved to break it as plainly to him as po&s;&s;ible, and either to bring him into it, or re|ceive a denial; for it was ea&s;y to &s;ee he had Inclinations which were favourable to that Intere&s;t, and &s;o had &s;everal other who were near the Queen, but they could not make it practicable for them, as they all &s;aid, to take any &s;tep in that Intere&s;t, without hazard to their own,
<PB N="242" REF="241">
and I never found they had a true Zeal for any thing el&s;e, but the la&s;t.</P>
<P>However, what I had in Commi&s;&s;ion, I re&s;olved to di&s;charge my &s;elf of, as well as I could, and to bring it on gra|dually, I told his L&mdash;p one E|venning, that I thought there might be &s;ome occa&s;ion for our mutual Con|fidence in &s;everal things that might occur in the en&s;uing Treaty, which would make it ea&s;ier to the Plenipotentia|ries, when they &s;hould come to meet, and that therefore it might not be ami&s;s if he thought fit, to continue our Meetings, that perhaps &s;everal things might offer in &s;uch Conferences, which had not oc|curr'd to us before, which might be of equal Service, and from whence a good I&s;&s;ue might be expected.</P>

but Five of the oppo&s;ite Party more in the Hou&s;e than there was that Day: They would then give ju&s;t contrary <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Opinion;</HI> and that this took much from the Weight of their Re&s;olves: that he knew very well, that in the Chamber of Deputies the &s;ame <HI>Opinion</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> was Condemn'd by 126 Voices; that as to her Maje&s;t's An&s;wer, it might very well be agreed to by all hone&s;t Men, and that I knew nothing more to the Pur|po&s;e, unle&s;s her Maje&s;ty had &s;aid, <HI>That &s;he &s;hould be &s;orry any one &s;hould think &s;he HAD NOT ALREADY done her utmo&s;t to recover</HI> Spain <HI>out of the Hands of the Hou&s;e of</HI> Bourbon; for my Lord &s;aid I, <HI>Has not all been done by WAR that could be done, and have we not beaten you out of</HI> Spain <HI>by a continued Series of Victory, and are ye able to recover it again? The Queen might well have &s;aid that &s;he had done her utmo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord an&s;wer'd, that I talk'd very Cavalierly of the War, but that it was not our Bu&s;ine&s;s, after the Confidence we had u&s;ed with one another to enquire who had mo&s;t occa&s;ion to put an End to it: And taking me by the Hand and &s;ha|king it, &s;aid, That I know the King of <HI>France</HI> was as hard pre&s;t by the War, as the Mini&s;try were by the Whigs, and
<PB N="245" REF="244">
that a Peace was nece&s;&s;ary to both, and it was both our Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es to con&s;ider what was to be done. <HI>My Lord,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>we &s;ettled that Point before, and little more can be &s;aid, let the Plenipotentiaries debate the Mediums: But let us begin with the other,</HI> and <HI>the main Heads that concern</HI> England, <HI>&s;eparately, and talk of them in Order, and we'll come to this again.</HI> I &s;aid this, be|cau&s;e I de&s;ired earne&s;tly to talk about the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Chevalier. <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays my Lord, I find you are willing to put off the mo&s;t difficult Points to la&s;t; where then will you begin?</P>
<P>I told him, I thought we ought to be|gin where the Articles began, <HI>viz.</HI> with the Satisfaction to be given her Maje|&s;ty's Per&s;on, in acknowledging her Ma|je&s;ty's Title to the Crown: And I ask'd him if they had any Form in which they would de&s;ire the King &s;hould do it, that the King, I was &s;ure, would &s;tick at no|thing to oblige her Maje&s;ty. My Lord &s;aid, He did not &s;ee any Thing needful in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, but what was u&s;ual in all &s;uch, <HI>viz.</HI> That her Maje&s;ty's Name, Stile and Titles be made u&s;e of in the Peace, and in all Commi&s;&s;ions, full Powers, Writings, In&s;truments, and Papers made u&s;e of in the Treaty, when mention was to be made of her Per|&s;on;
<PB N="246" REF="245">
that in the mean time &s;he &s;hall be formally treated with as Queen, and that as &s;oon as the Peace is made, an Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary &s;hall be &s;ent to Congratulate her Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, and to own her in the Quality of Queen: And &s;ays he, there's another Thing that I believe the Queen will ex|pect, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Stile of King &s;hall not be given to the <HI>Chevalier.</HI></P>
<P>This was what I waited for, I told him immediately, his Maje&s;ty would readily agree to all the Particulars he had mentioned, or any Thing el&s;e her Maje&s;ty de&s;ired; that as to the <HI>Cheva|lier,</HI> the Title was nothing in the&s;e Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> for the Title of a Family was frequently given to all the Children of that Family, tho' the Elde&s;t only enjoy'd the Sovereignty or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But <HI>now we are mentioning that unfortunate Branch of your Family.</HI> My Lord, &s;aid I, <HI>What will her Maje&s;ty have us do in this Ca&s;e,</HI> and how &s;hall we di&s;po&s;e of him till her Ma|je&s;ty plea&s;e to do him the Ju&s;tice &s;he in|tends?</P>
<P>He turned very briskly, and asked me what I meant, and that I mu&s;t have a great Care what I &s;aid upon that Sub|ject, for Sir, &s;ays he, if you mention
<PB N="247" REF="246">
but his Name among the Mini&s;try, you will frighten them all out of their Wits. <HI>Why &s;o,</HI> my Lord, &s;aid I, <HI>they will, no doubt, do him Ju&s;tice after the Queen. I don't know but they might, if they had it in their Choice,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but they are &s;o jealous of one another on that Head, that not one of them dares mention his Name.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, I was &s;orry they were &s;o frighted at a thing which they knew ve|ry well how to reconcile; and that &s;ee|ing they could not but know he mu&s;t one Time or other be their Ma&s;ter, why &s;hould they not &s;trive to Merit from him. He told me very &s;eriou&s;ly, he thought they would never be thorowly ea&s;y in <HI>England</HI> till it was &s;o, but at pre&s;ent it was the main Clamour which the Whigs made u&s;e of to inflame the People again&s;t them; that the Thing was remote, the Queen a young Woman, and might very well live Twenty Years longer, and they had too much on their Hands to enter into any Di&s;cour&s;e about Things of that Nature; that as I knew her Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tice would not permit her to &s;uffer any Injury to him, which might be prevented; &s;o there might, no Que&s;tion, &s;everal Mediums be found out to reconcile all the Difficulties that other People thought &s;o great; that the King
<PB N="248" REF="247">
of <HI>France</HI> would Contribute all his good Offices to accommodate that Matter to her Maje&s;ty's Satisfaction, that her Royal Hou&s;e might not be Extinct while the Male Branch remained, nor her Crown be po&s;&s;e&s;t by Strangers when a Na|tive, beloved by her People, and who merited to be beloved by all the World, was remaining, and that his Maje&s;ty hoped the Queen would not de&s;ire him to abandon the only Son of her dear Fa|ther, who had recommended him &s;o ear|ne&s;tly to the Protection of <HI>France</HI> on his Death-Bed.</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd a little &s;urpri&s;ed at my Di&s;|cour&s;e; and told me, he did fore&s;ee that the Chevalier mu&s;t be named in the Treaty, and that for Form &s;ake, there might be &s;everal Demands about him. I an&s;wered, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make a Treaty without naming him, and he did not fore&s;ee how they could do le&s;s than oblige the King of <HI>France</HI> to re|move him out of his Dominions; and that therefore, if he might offer his Opinion in private, it would be, that the Chevalier &s;hould, on pretence of a Journey, Travel into &s;ome Parts of the Countries adjoining to <HI>France,</HI> and take that occa&s;ion to be ab&s;ent from <HI>France</HI> at the time of the Treaty; as if he re&s;i|ded by Choice in &s;uch Country.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="248">
I told him, I hoped what ever they expected of the King for Form &s;ake, they would hearken to &s;ome Medium in Behalf of the Right of that Prince, whom the Laws of God and Nature had made a King from his Cradle.</P>
<P>He replied, that he was very glad to hear me talk of &s;uch Mediums, for he fore&s;aw the King of <HI>France</HI> would be obliged not &s;o much to abandon the Che|valier, as to acknowledge the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> as it was mentioned in the &s;econd Preli|minary; and he beg'd me to tell him what Mediums could be found out.</P>
<P>I ask'd his Lord&s;hip, if his Demand was only to hear what I had to offer, or whether it was a &s;incere Intention to accept of Propo&s;als for accommodating the Intere&s;t of the Chevalier after the Queen. He prote&s;ted to me, that he &s;hould be glad to have the Crown de|&s;cend into the right Line, and that he believed the Nation would be mo&s;t ef|fectually &s;ettled by &s;uch a Thing, e&s;pe|cially if the Chevalier would accept of the Advice of &s;ome of his be&s;t Friends as to his future Conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="249">
I an&s;wered, That there needed no more than that a &s;ecret Article &s;hould be made by the Queen, to di&s;ingage the King from all the Obligations of &s;uch Agreements upon &s;uch &s;ub&s;equent Occa|&s;ions as might happen, and a Declaration from her Maje&s;ty, that all the Engage|ments the King &s;hould enter into in the Treaty of Peace, &s;hould be &s;o under|&s;tood by the Queen.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, That he dur&s;t not &s;ay the Queen would Sign &s;uch a Declarati|on, but he dur&s;t engage the Queen would declare by Word of Mouth to him before the Treaty was begun, that &s;he would be &s;atisfied to under&s;tand the Treaty in &s;uch a manner, and that when ever &s;he di&s;charged the King from it, the Obligation on him as to the Recog|nition of the Succe&s;&s;ion &s;hould cea&s;e.</P>
<P>I told him, I did not que&s;tion but the King would accept of a Verbal Decla|ration, and the rather becau&s;e I told him, we were all thorowly &s;atisfied her Ma|je&s;ty would do the Chevalier Ju&s;tice at la&s;t, if not in her Life-time; nay, I was per&s;waded if other Obligations did not hinder, I believed her Maje&s;ty was &s;o good a Chri&s;tian, as not to po&s;&s;e&s;s the
<PB N="251" REF="250">
Right of her Brother one Hour, if &s;he were but to hear what the King her Fa|ther &s;aid of it on his Death-Bed. Here I told him what I had heard the Abbot <HI>Gualtier</HI> had undertaken to do, and how I was pre&s;&s;ed to offer at the &s;ame.</P>
<P>My Lord &s;eemed &s;upri&s;ed at what I &s;aid, and returned, that for his Part he &s;hould be glad to &s;it by and hear the Abbot Harangue upon that Head, and he dur&s;t an&s;wer for the Queen that &s;he would give him a very perti|nent An&s;wer: But that he dur&s;t not undertake to per&s;wade the Queen to <HI>Demit</HI> and &s;et up the Chevalier: Be|&s;ides, he &s;aid, the Queen under|&s;tood the Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> much bet|ter than &s;o; that it was Peace and an End of &s;hedding Blood that her Maje&s;ty de&s;ired, whereas &s;uch a Thing as this would not only kindle a new Fire of War in <HI>Europe,</HI> but remove it from fo|reign Countries and bring it into her own, and to the Gates of her Palace.</P>
<P>I acknowledge this Di&s;cour&s;e had Weight in it, but I was not willing to own it to him, becau&s;e I was unwil|ling to give up the Intere&s;t of the Che|valier on any Account, and therefore I
<PB N="252" REF="251">
told him, that as to a new War, it was mo&s;t certain, that as the King my Ma|&s;ter had carried on this long War to &s;uch a Degree again&s;t all the Confederates; &s;o he de&s;ired no Man to put an End to it, if he could have <HI>Great Britain</HI> draw a Sword again&s;t them too.</P>
<P>He &s;miled at my Di&s;cour&s;e, and told me, That he found I did not under&s;tand him, that I mi&s;took when I talk'd of the Queen, turning all her Forces, &amp;c. that nothing was &s;o &s;ure as that, &s;hould the Queen offer at it, &s;he would have no Forces, that all her Officers, Army and Navy would Revolt from her as one Man; and ask'd me if I thought the Queen had forgot the Fate of her Fa|ther.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s he &s;ilenced me with tho&s;e Reflections, and I &s;tood mute for a while, but not willing to drop the Di&s;cour&s;e, I mentioned again the Power of the King my Ma&s;ter, <HI>Mon&s;ieur,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Speak no more of that, you know it is Peace, not a new War that the King your Ma&s;ter aims at; our Mi&s;tre&s;s de&s;ires it;</HI> But <HI>your Ma|&s;ter really wants it, at lea&s;t he does not want to run into a new War: Remember that his Attempt again&s;t the general ri&s;ing of this Nation again&s;t King</HI> James, <HI>brought the fir&s;t</HI>

<P>My Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> the Propo&s;al is the Abbot <HI>Gualtiers,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you will hear of it in Publick; I confe&s;s, I do not think it very Practicable, tho' I wi&s;h it were other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>I entreated him then to con&s;ider what might be done, and to &s;peak to the Queen about it. <HI>He told me,</HI> that he did not &s;ee room to do any Thing at pre&s;ent, for that no Body could, or dur&s;t &s;peak a Word about it, and indeed he could not &s;ee it was proper &s;o much as to mention it to the Queen.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="253">
I replied, That certainly the Queen could not be &s;o often talking of tho&s;e Things, but &s;he mu&s;t &s;ometime or other mention her Brother; and that I thought nothing could be more <HI>Apropo</HI> than to ask her Maje&s;ty what her Plea|&s;ure was on that Head, and how &s;he would plea&s;e to have him di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He told me, That tho' it was true, that this &s;eem'd Rea&s;onable and Natural upon any &s;uch Occa&s;ion, yet he knew not whether it could be done or not; however, that he would wait &s;uch an Opportunity as might pre&s;ent, and let me know what was the I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>We had no Meeting after this for five or &s;ix Days, except once, when Compa|ny prevented any private Di&s;cour&s;e, on|ly my Lord took an Opportunity ju&s;t at taking his Leave, to &s;ay, He had <HI>thought much</HI> of what we di&s;cour&s;ed la&s;t, and that he believed &s;omething would be done in it: But two Days after, he &s;ent a Servant to tell me, that if I plea&s;ed to Sup with him in Private, he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me at Eight a Clock, I went accordingly; and we were in Pri|vate indeed, not a Servant being admit|ted

to us, but one that waited while we eat: After Supper, my Lord told me, he had met with an unexpected Opportu|nity of mentioning to the Queen what I had recommended to him about the Che|valier, and that the Manner was divert|ing. He told me, he had the Honour to be drinking Tea in the Apartment of a certain Lady, very near the Queen, and that as the Di&s;cour&s;e every where was upon the&s;e new Preliminaries, &s;o much more was it &s;o there, and that the Lady began very freely with him upon that Head: And Sir, &s;ays he to me, <HI>I think you &s;hould have had a Conference with her on this Subject, for by my Faith, the Women dare &s;ay any thing.</HI></P>
<P>I was mighty earne&s;t to hear the Par|ticulars, and begg'd his Lord&s;hip would be pleas'd to let me into the Introducti|on, as well as into the Story it &s;elf: He told me he would do &s;o at large, and then went on thus.</P>

<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible to repeat her Di&s;cour&s;e, be&s;ides the Queen came in and in|terrupted us.</P>
<P>This made me more eager to know the Particulars of their Di&s;cour&s;e, and I pre&s;t him as much as good Manners would permit, when on a &s;udden he turn|ed about, I think, &s;ays he, I mu&s;t bring you and my Lady&mdash;<HI>together and &s;ee what you can make of it; &s;he will talk as freely of it as you can De&s;ire, for</HI>
<PB N="262" REF="261">
<HI>my Part, I am afraid &s;o much as to talk $ my &s;elf of it.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wered, I would be infinitely obli|ged to him to introduce me to &s;uch a Lady, as by his Character of her, I found &s;he was, and e&s;pecially being one near the Queen too; but I beg'd of him, neverthele&s;s, to go on a little further with the Story, e&s;pecially becau&s;e he had mentioned that the Queen came into the Conver&s;ation, he told me he would oblige me as far as he could, but that he could not remember it all; but that when he &s;poke of the Queen's be|ing advi&s;ed, &s;he reflected &s;eriou&s;ly on their not advi&s;ing the Queen, that they might be &s;ure the Queen expected they &s;hould make that Matter ea&s;y to her as well as other Things: That the Queen &s;aw them all &s;o frighted about the Whigs calling them to an Account, that it made her change the Mini&s;try. They repre&s;ented the Whigs to the Queen as a mo&s;t contemptible Party, who they were able to overthrow in every Thing; and now on a &s;udden they were afraid of the very Shadow of them; that there was not a Man among the whole Mini&s;try but my Lord Trea&s;urer, that ever &s;poke a Cheerful Word to the
<PB N="263" REF="262">
Queen, that they ought to know she was a Woman as well as a So|vereign, and that if they were not able to &s;upport what they had underta|ken, they ought to tell her &s;o hone&s;tly, that &s;he might find other Hands that under&s;tood their Bu&s;ine&s;s better.</P>
<P>That in the new Articles there &s;eem'd nothing dige&s;ted, and they &s;eem'd to have left Things &s;o much to the Ple|nipotentiaries, that they had not found &s;o much as a Scheme for them to Act up|on, for Example in this Ca&s;e of the <HI>Che|valier:</HI> When ever the Queen enquired about it, all the An&s;wer &s;he could get was, that they put it off from one to another, one knew nothing of it, and another knew nothing of it; and if ever their Opinion was &s;eperately ask'd, every one always an&s;wered for him&s;elf, that he did not know what to advi&s;e; that he dur&s;t not talk of it, that it was a dangerous Point to &s;peak of, and &s;uch Stuff, as that &s;he wonder'd what Men of Council, and State Wi&s;dom as they all pretended to be, could An&s;wer a Queen in &s;uch a manner, that by the Preliminaries &s;he found he was to be forgotten, and not &s;o much as named&punc; but we might depend upon it he &s;hould

<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he had named the Word BROTHER, the Queen came into the Place; <HI>What,</HI> &s;ays the Queen, <HI>are you always talking Politicks.</HI></P>
<P>Lord Madam, &s;ays &s;he merrily, here's my Lord&mdash;naming me to the Queen, <HI>turned Whig. I cannot think that,</HI> &s;ays the Queen. He is turned Cruel and Barbarous, replies &s;he, <HI>and that I think is to be a Whig.</HI></P>
<P>What is the Matter, <HI>&s;ays the Queen?</HI></P>
<P>Nay Madam, it is all before your Maje|&s;ty, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> their new <HI>Preliminaries here have been the Di&s;pute, I tell my Lord, They</HI> are &s;o Worded, that they will neither let your Maje&s;ty do any thing for a cer|tain Per&s;on, or do it them&s;elves, I &s;up|po&s;e they would be rid on him at any Price;
<PB N="265" REF="264">
I wi&s;h they would tell your Maje&s;ty what you are to do with him.</P>
<P><HI>Says the Queen,</HI> I can never get one of them &s;o much as to &s;peak of him, or to An&s;wer me a Que&s;tion about him, and I don't pre&s;s them, but I hope they will do as becomes them.</P>
<P><HI>I reply'd pre&s;ently to my Lady, not mentioning any thing of what the Queen had &s;aid; Madam,</HI> you Complain of the Mini&s;trys doing nothing in that Affair, per|haps you do not know what is offered at by &s;ome Per&s;ons at this very Time.</P>
<P>Not I, <HI>indeed, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> all Things are &s;o lock'd up with my Lord Trea&s;urer, that we hear nothing; my Lord is incommunicable, all the Queen her &s;elf knows from him, amounts to little more, than that in General all Things go well, and be ea&s;y, <HI>Madam,</HI> be ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Madam &s;ays I, turning to the Queen, your Maje&s;ty knows Mon&s;ieur <HI>M</HI>&mdash;is &s;till in Town, he de&s;ires nothing more than to talk freely of this Matter; and it is true, as my Lady&mdash;&s;ays, that the Mini&s;try are all afraid of meddling with it; he &s;ays, he has &s;omething of
<PB N="266" REF="265">
very great Importance to offer about it, and thinks it hard, that after the Preli|minaries are &s;ettled with him, no Body will give him Audience on the re&s;t. I think if your Maje&s;ty plea&s;es to hear it, my Lady&mdash;would be the be&s;t <HI>Plenipo|tentiary</HI> in &s;uch an Affair; I'll bring Mon&s;.&mdash;to wait on her. <HI>With all my Heart,</HI> &s;ays my Lady&mdash;if the Queen will give me leave, <HI>I won't be &s;o much afraid, as all you Politicians are, that you dare neither &s;peak nor hear.</HI></P>
<P>I think, <HI>&s;ays the Queen,</HI> there can be no Harm in this, any more than in the Pre|liminaries, to hear what they offer.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, we broke up our Di&s;cour&s;e, and I thought I did you a Service you would be plea&s;ed with; and I doubt not the next Time I &s;ee her, &s;he will ask if I have brought you and where you are, for &s;he is mighty willing to talk of the Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I told him he had done me a great deal of Ju&s;tice, in &s;aying that I de&s;ired nothing more than to talk freely of that Affair; and &s;eeing the Women had &s;o much more Courage than the Men, I &s;hould be as glad of a Female Plenipo|tentiary
<PB N="267" REF="266">
as of any other, and only de|&s;ired the Favour to be called to a Con|ference as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, for that the Time drew near when I mu&s;t be gone, his Maje&s;ty having done me the Ho|nour to Name me for one of the Pleni|potentiaries at the approaching Treaty at <HI>&V;trecht.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd at that, and ask|ed me if I gave him leave to let the Queen know it, adding, that he was &s;ure it would be very agreeable to her Maje&s;ty, I told him, I would always be glad to acquaint her Maje&s;ty with every thing that would plea&s;e her, and that he might a&s;&s;ure her Maje&s;ty the King had done me that Honour, on Condition that it was acceptable to the Queen of <HI>England;</HI> &s;o that I had her Maje&s;ty's Approbation to get to my Commi&s;&s;ion, before it would pa&s;s: This made it nece&s;&s;ary to let his Lord&s;hip know, that I had been private|ly with the King, which a little &s;urpri|&s;ed him, my Stay having been &s;o &s;hort, that he hardly mi&s;s'd me.</P>
<P>He then told me, that he began now indeed to think, what he had no Notion of before, <HI>viz.</HI> That I had &s;omething of Importance &s;till to offer. I an&s;wered, I
<PB N="268" REF="267">
had &s;o, but that I would be very free with him, it related wholly to the Affairs of the Court of St. <HI>Germans,</HI> that I would not offer to Di&s;cour&s;e with any&punc; one but him&s;elf, if he would enter into that Point with me, but that if he cho&s;e to refer me to any one el&s;e, I would be directed by him.</P>
<P>He replied, that he was in Earne&s;t in naming the Lady&mdash;to me, for that in Truth for his own Part he did not care to venture; and as for the Women they feared no Body, and that &s;eeing I was willing, he would bring us together in a Day or two. And he added, this I can a&s;&s;ure you, that what you &s;ay there, will be &s;oone&s;t and with mo&s;t Advantage convey'd to the Queen, nay, perhaps, &s;ays he, you may &s;ometimes &s;ee the Queen her &s;elf on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was not long after this, that he carried me to Court, where I follow'd himthro' &s;everal Appartments; at la&s;t we were &s;topt, by the Queen's happening to be pa&s;&s;ing out of her withdrawing Room into her Clo&s;et, we paid our Comple|ments, and pa&s;t on, at length we came into a Room where was a Table by the Fire, and a large ea&s;y Chair, and a Ta|ble at another Side of the Room with
<PB N="269" REF="268">
two Candles and &s;ome loo&s;e Cards: I found afterwards this was the Lady's A|partment that I was to meet, that there had been &s;ome Ladies at Play, but that the Queen had come in, and the Ladies were all fled; that the Queen had &s;at by the Fire &s;ome time after, and was ju&s;t come away when we met her.</P>
<P>The Lady I was to meet with, it &s;eems, was with the Queen; but both the Queen and &s;he too &s;eeing my Lord&mdash;and another Per&s;on with him going on, &s;he came back to us and found us in her Chamber.</P>
<P>When her Lady&s;hip was come into the Room; My Lord&mdash;I found, paid her great Re&s;pect, which tho' it gave me no light into her Name or Quality, yet it imported that &s;he was a Per&s;on fit for me to talk with, after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e be|tween them, he pre&s;ented me to her, and told her, this was the Gentleman he had told her Lady&s;hip of, and that I was in Commi&s;&s;ion from the King of <HI>France,</HI> &s;o that &s;he might put Confidence in all that I &s;hould &s;ay: that &s;he knew what Subject we were to talk upon; that the Court of St <HI>Germans</HI> were very anxious about the Share they &s;hould have in
<PB N="270" REF="269">
Negotiations that were on Foot as to the <HI>Chevalier.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He was going to &#38; s;ay more when &s;he interrupted him,</HI> Pray, my Lord, do not call him by that barbarous Name, call him any Thing but that, and Pretender.</P>
<P>Well Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I'll call him by no Name that &s;hall offend you; but I cannot talk of him at all, I refer it all to this Honour|able Per&s;on and your &s;elf.</P>
<P>With that &s;he turned to me, and told me &s;he &s;hould be very glad of a little Di&s;cour&s;e upon that Head. <HI>LORD,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>the&s;e Politick People</HI> are &s;o &s;hie one of another, they are frighted at Shadows, <HI>for my Part I fear nothing,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, I'll hear what ever you can &s;ay, Sir, and do what ever I can for him: <HI>Call him what you will,</HI> added &s;he, <HI>is he not the Queen's Brother, I know him by that Name, and no other:</HI> And with this &s;he made me &s;it down.</P>
<P>Being thus entred upon Di&s;cour&s;e, my Lord withdrew among &s;ome Ladies who were playing at Cards in the next Room, and I found my &s;elf left alone with my Lady&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="270">
Here I was at &s;ome Lo&s;s how to break my De&s;ign, but &s;he let me &s;oon know that &s;he expected no Ceremony. Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I know your Character, what you have been doing here, and have been always with the Queen when my Lord&mdash;has given her Maje&s;ty an Account of the private Di&s;cour&s;es you two have had, for this is the Room where the Queen always retired to hear it; with this &s;he related &s;everal Branches of our Di&s;cour&s;e, which convinced me, that what &s;he &s;aid was true.</P>
<P>Whereupon ri&s;ing up and making her a very low Bow, I told her I had had the Honour of a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e in Confidence with my Lord, as I per|ceived &s;he knew, that he always told me, that what I Communicated to him, he always laid before the Queen, as I on the other Hand had done the like to the King; that it was the true End of our Confidence mutually to &s;erve our re&s;pe|ctive Sovereigns, and to bring them to tho&s;e Terms of Peace and Friend&s;hip, which they both de&s;ired, and that I hop'd we &s;hould have the Succe&s;s we de&s;ired; but that I had a &s;ecret Commi&s;&s;ion which I was very loth to Communicate to any but &s;uch as his Lord&s;hip &s;hould think
<PB N="272" REF="271">
proper, and that it was for this End I was introduced to her Lady&s;hip, and de|&s;ired to know if &s;he required me to &s;hew my Credentials.</P>
<P>No, by no means, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I am no Plenipotentiary, but I know the meaning is, that we &s;hould talk of that poor di&s;tre&s;s'd Branch of the Royal Blood that is in Exile in your Country, we are very anxious about him.</P>
<P>Madam, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> the Sum of what I have in Commi&s;&s;ion is this, That the King my Ma&s;ter would be glad to know, what is her Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure to have done in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> we are at the greate&s;t lo&s;s imaginable, we mu&s;t not appear to have the lea&s;t Concern about him, we know the <HI>Whigs</HI> will oblige us to pu&s;h at his De&s;truction, if po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>But Madam,</HI> &s;ays I, the King hopes you won't go &s;uch a length.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;he drew a little Table which &s;tood by her nearer to me, and de&s;ired me to &s;it down, and with an Air of mo&s;t obliging Freedom told me, That
<PB N="273" REF="272">
&s;he was very glad to have an Opportuni|ty to Conver&s;e with me upon this Affair, that indeed it was a tender Subject, and the Mini&s;ters were afraid to &s;peak of it, even to the Queen her &s;elf; but that if I thought fit to Communicate to her what I had in Charge upon that Head, &s;he would a&s;&s;ure me &s;he would not be &s;o &s;hy of it.</P>
<P>I told her that I had no In&s;tructions to propo&s;e, becau&s;e the King was now to receive his Mea&s;ures from her Maje&s;ty, being re&s;olv'd to Act as the Queen &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, that was putting hard upon <HI>her Maje&s;ty,</HI> that the Queen could do nothing in his Favour, as things &s;tood; but that it was hoped the King of <HI>France</HI> might find out &s;ome way to Act in his Behalf, if not now, at lea&s;t hereafter.</P>
<P>I told her, that mu&s;t be according as they bound him, or left him free, by the Treaty; and therefore as the King was &s;incerely willing to &s;erve the <HI>Chevalier</HI> to his uttermo&s;t, as Occa&s;ion &s;hould pre|&s;ent, &s;o the Bu&s;ine&s;s for her Ladyship and I to negotiate, was to &s;ee if po&s;&s;ible, that the King might &s;it loo&s;e in that Article,
<PB N="274" REF="273">
or at lea&s;t that no Obligation might be laid upon him, but what her Maje&s;ty might hereafter acquit him of.</P>
<P>She told me I mu&s;t not ask any thing of the Queen that her Maje&s;ty could not grant.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, That I would not wil|lingly do &s;o, but that I thought as all the Articles which concerned the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion to her Maje&s;ty's Dominions, were properly a Capitulation with her &s;elf on|ly; it was in her Maje&s;ty of right to li|mit the Extent of the Obligation, and to declare how far they &s;hould or &s;hould not be binding upon <HI>France</HI> after her Death.</P>
<P>She told me, &s;he was fully of my Mind, but that &s;he feared the Queen would not be brought to give any &s;uch Explanati|on to that Article, or to &s;ign any &s;uch Declaration under her Hand by any Means.</P>
<P>I told her, there appeared to me no other Way than one of the&s;e two, either that the Articles which &s;hould oblige the King to acknowledge the pre&s;ent Settle|ment, &s;hould be made &s;o, as not to bind
<PB N="275" REF="274">
the King beyond her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on&punc; and the Term of her Life, or that &s;ome &s;ecret Explanatory Article &s;hould be en|tered into, to &s;ettle the Matter, &s;o as that at her Maje&s;ty's Decea&s;e, <HI>France</HI> might be at Liberty to Act as should be conve|nient. She replied, the&s;e were difficult Points; however she would take a little Time to think of them, and that we might meet again in a Day or two up|on them, which I &s;ubmitted to, and took my leave: The Lady calling my Lord&mdash;who was <HI>L' introducteur d' Am|ba&s;&s;adeurs</HI> for that Time, to go out with me.</P>
<P>About three Days after, my Lord&mdash;&s;ent to me again; and when I came to him, he told me the Lady de&s;ired to &s;peak with me again upon the old Af|fair; &s;o I went directly with him, and found her all alone waiting on pur|po&s;e for me; we &s;at down to Di&s;cour&s;e with very little Ceremony. My L&mdash;withdrawing as before; she began very frankly with telling me, that she knew I had but very little Time here, that the Affair we had to Di&s;cour&s;e of was, in her Opinion, brought into a very nar|row Compa&s;s; and that our Debate re|lated to two Things, which she &s;um|med up thus.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="276" REF="275">
1. That a Treaty being ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to be &s;et on Foot to re&s;tore Peace to the two Kingdom, who&s;e Intere&s;ts were not now e&s;teem'd &s;o remote, as they were formerly thought to be. It would follow, that for the Satisfa|ction of the People, and of the Allies abroad, the King &s;hould be requi|red in the Queen's Name, to aban|don her Brother and his Intere&s;t, on pretence of adhering to the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion as it was now E&s;tablish'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. That neverthele&s;s this &s;eeming to abandon the &s;aid Intere&s;t, was to be &s;o under&s;tood, that the King should not be obliged, in ca&s;e of her Maje&s;ty's Decea&s;e, not to u&s;e his Endeavours for the placing the &s;aid Prince on his Father's Throne, to which he had an undoubted Right.</P>
<P>We join'd immediately in granting that this was the Ca&s;e, but how this In|terpretation of the &s;aid Clau&s;e of aban|doning the <HI>Chevalier</HI> &s;hould be made Au|thentick, remain'd a Difficulty; I &s;aid it mu&s;t be referred to the Treaty, and that if po&s;&s;ible the Clau&s;e for abandon|ing should be made &s;o &s;afe, that
<PB N="277" REF="276">
his Maje&s;ty might not be obliged to har|der Terms of that kind than need mu&s;t, and that the Plenipotentiaries &s;hould be in&s;tructed accordingly.</P>
<P>I then ask'd her if I &s;hould have the Honour to hear how Things went on here, what might be the Re&s;olutions taken in that Ca&s;e, and what Conditi|ons might be granted, which I told her would be of great U&s;e to me, becau&s;e the King had done me the Honour to Name me to be one of his Plenipotenti|aries at the Treaty.</P>
<P>She Complemented me upon the Ho|nour I had receiv'd, and &s;aid &s;ome very fine Things to me upon that Head, which I receiv'd with a due Acknowledgment of her Goodne&s;s, and ask'd her if &s;he would do me the Honour, to give me leave to Communicate to her Ladyship what &s;hould pa&s;s on this Occa&s;ion, and receive her In&s;tructions. She told me, with all her Heart, &s;he &s;hould be glad to Corre|&s;pond, and that &s;he would give me a Key to write to her by, and that her Let|ters &s;hould be enclo&s;ed to Mon&s;ieur, who belonged to the Emba&s;&s;y, and would not fail to be there.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="277">
<HI>But,</HI> Sir, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>there remains one Thing, which I think may be pre&s;ently di&s;|cour&s;ed of;</HI> whereupon &s;he propo&s;ed a Difficulty, which &s;he &s;aid, I might for ought &s;he knew re&s;olve beforehand. <HI>There is no que&s;tion,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>but they will oblige the King to remove him out of</HI> France, or as the u&s;ual Term is, out of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions; <HI>now where, &s;aid &s;he, will you &s;end him?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wered, That I made no que&s;ti|on but that &s;he had &s;omething to offer upon that Head, becau&s;e &s;he propo&s;ed the Que&s;tion: She prote&s;ted &s;he had not, that &s;he had been mu&s;ing and revolving all the Countries in the World in her Thoughts, and could not think of a Place for him, where it was convenient he &s;hould go, or where it would be tollerable to his Friends to have him re|&s;ide, &s;he did not doubt but the Plenipo|tentiaries would determine the Place.</P>
<P>I told her, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear her &s;peak of it in &s;uch a manner, that it was contrary to the Practice, that the U&s;age of Nations and National Treaties left no Precedent for it; that if the King of <HI>France</HI> be obliged by the Treaty to aban|don
<PB N="279" REF="278">
the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> it mu&s;t be in &s;ome Form like this, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That he &s;hall oblige him to depart his Dominions; that this was enough; that they had no Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire whither he went; it was hardship enough to bid him go; to do the other, was to take him Pri&s;oner and Bani&s;h him to a particular Place, which was not in the Nature of the Thing, it could neither be ask'd or grant|ed, nor could I &s;ee any Rea&s;on to think that the Confederates would meddle with it.</P>
<P>She &s;eem'd a little &s;atisfied with what I had &s;aid upon that Head, but offered to put it to me to Name a Place where I would propo&s;e his Re&s;idence. I told her that I thought it was needle&s;s to Propo&s;e, &s;eeing Nature would dictate, and the <HI>Chevalier</HI> was not &s;o void of Council as not to re&s;olve to be as near <HI>France</HI> as po&s;&s;ible he might be; that after the Peace was made, there would be &s;eve|ral Countries, whither he might retreat, who&s;e Princes would be &s;ufficiently in the Intere&s;t of <HI>France</HI> to &s;ecure his Per|&s;on from Danger, and where he might have hand&s;ome U&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="279">
She &s;eem'd very anxious about it, and &s;aid &s;he would not have him too remote, for that there would certainly be a &s;ud|den Occa&s;ion for him in <HI>England</HI> one Time or other. I told her, I hoped &s;o, and that I would be glad to Contribute to his Service on any Occa&s;ion. <HI>We can only lay Foundations for it now,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>but without tho&s;e Foundations, and unle&s;s they are laid</HI> now, <HI>we &s;hall be undone when the Juncture happens.</HI></P>
<P>She pre&s;t me then to Name any Place where he might Re&s;ide upon the Suppo|&s;ition of the King's being obliged by the Treaty to abandon him and remove him out of <HI>France.</HI> I told her, naming Places by way of Advice to him, I might do, but not as from the King, That the Ele|ctor of <HI>Cologn,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in his Dutchy of <HI>Deux Ponts,</HI> any of the&s;e might afford him a &s;afe Retreat, if he found him&s;elf oblig'd to quit <HI>France,</HI> and that he was within three or four Days riding of <HI>Paris,</HI> if any Emergency required his Return to Court, and there was no doubt but that tho' the King would not be obliged to point tho&s;e Places out to him; yet if he was willing to go to any of them, the

King would u&s;e his Intere&s;t with tho&s;e Princes to receive and entertain him. I a&s;&s;ured her that the King my Ma&s;ter was &s;o far from de&s;iring to put any Difficulties or Hardships upon him, that the Rea&s;on and End of my pre&s;ent Negotiation was, that it might not be required of his Ma|je&s;ty at the Treaty by the Queen's A|gents; and that Things might be made as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, it being not doubted by the King that the <HI>Chevalier</HI> would &s;oon|er or later be call'd by Heaven to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Legal Right to the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Crown, or that it was her Maje&s;ty's De&s;ire he &s;hould after her Decea&s;e enjoy it in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible.

<P><HI>She told me,</HI> that what ever I &s;aid upon this Subject, &s;he took as if it came from the King's own Mouth, by whom, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he knew I was intru&s;ted in that Affair, and if I plea&s;ed to give equal Credit to what &s;he should &s;ay to me, it would give the more Weight to what we should Conclude. <HI>I bow'd,</HI> and a&s;|&s;ured her, <HI>That</HI> whil&s;t I had the Honour
<PB N="282" REF="281">
to wait on her Ladyship, I took my &s;elf to be at an Audience with the Queen, that I knew well enough this was a Ca&s;e in which the Queen her &s;elf could not &s;peak with openne&s;s to any one: That I took it to be the unhappine&s;s of &s;ome pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Go|vernment, which made it &s;o, and that I could not &s;uppo&s;e it to be any Defect in the Di&s;po&s;ition of her Maje&s;ty; that I hoped she would believe the King of <HI>France</HI> knew how to di&s;tinguish right in the Ca&s;e, and how to Act &s;uitable to &s;uch Emergencies as came before him, that in the mean time it was my Bu&s;ine&s;s to believe every Word that came from her Mouth, and give the &s;ame Honour to it, as if &s;poken by the Queen her &s;elf.</P>
<P>She returned then to her fir&s;t De&s;ign, and told me she would give me her Notion of Things, which was, That it was the pre&s;ent unhappine&s;s of the Queen to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Throne of her Bro|ther, and which she had no other Claim to than what the Political Mea&s;ures of the State had made Legal, and in a &s;ort nece&s;&s;ary, which however, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> she believed gave her Maje&s;ty often times &s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s: That this was not all
<PB N="283" REF="282">
the Misfortune, but that by the&s;ame Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of State, she was obliged not only again&s;t her Di&s;po&s;ition, but even again&s;t her Principles, to further and promote the Continuance of the U&s;urpation, not on|ly beyond her own Life, but for ever. <HI>That</HI> I might be &s;ure under &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances it would be an unexpre&s;&s;ible Satisfaction to her Maje&s;ty, to &s;ee her &s;elf delivered from the fatal Nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;o much Wrong; and if it could be po&s;&s;ible with Safety, to the Religion and Liberties of her Subjects, to have her Brother re&s;tored to his Right, at lea&s;t after her Decea&s;e, if it could not be done before.</P>
<P>That it was true the Queen did not &s;ee thro' this, and it &s;eem'd next to im|po&s;&s;ible, <HI>The Rage and Irreconcileable A|ver&s;ion of the greatest Part of the Common People to the Return of her Brother being grown to &s;uch an height:</HI> Nay, she &s;aid, the Queen found it would be impo&s;&s;ible to enter upon any Treaty of Peace, or &s;o much as to let the People hear of putting an End to the War, without entring in|to the &s;tronge&s;t Engagments po&s;&s;ible for the Confirming the Succe&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover, a Thing that I am &s;ure,</HI> &s;ays she, <HI>is all our Aver&s;ions,</HI>

<P>I heard her with great Attention, and taking hold of her la&s;t Words, I replied, That I found &s;he had clearer Thoughts in this Affair than all the State&s;men in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and that &s;he had &s;aid more to the Purpo&s;e, in a few Words, than all the Men of State that I had met with, who all treated it with wary Expre&s;&s;ions, remote and impracticable Notions, <HI>double Entonders,</HI> and Words which &s;ignified no more than this, that they were afraid to own what at the &s;ame time they would have us believe they de&s;ired; and that they talk'd as if they neither aim'd at doing any Service to the Thing they propo&s;ed, or had any Zeal but to their own Safety;
<PB N="285" REF="284">
that they &s;eem'd to me to make no Dif|ference between Conver&s;ing over a Gla&s;s of Wine with their Friends, and talking with a Man under Character and Com|mi&s;&s;ion'd to Treat, but that &s;he had brought the Thing into a Cour&s;e of Ne|gotiation in a few Words, and we had now &s;omething material to go upon.</P>
<P>I told her this was was the very Thing the King de&s;ired, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Plenipotentiaries might be in&s;tructed to in&s;i&s;t upon Things no further than Ne|ce&s;&s;ity obliged, that nothing might be de&s;ired of his Maje&s;ty which he could not grant, and that he might not be pu&s;hed to do Things by the Queen's Brother, which did not become him as a King, and which would Cla&s;h with the profound Re&s;pect he had pre&s;erv'd for his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Family.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e, I told her there might be room left for the King to di&s;engage him&s;elf hereafter from the &s;eeming Obli|gation of that Part of the Treaty, and his Maje&s;ty might be at Liberty to Act as Occa&s;ion &s;hould pre&s;ent: And here I made an offer, that the Am|ba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary which the King &s;hould &s;end to <HI>England</HI> immediately af|ter the Peace, &s;hould have private In|&s;tructions
<PB N="286" REF="285">
to enter into a new Treaty to e&s;tabli&s;h the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and &s;ettle the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown.</P>
<P>She replied, that this was a Step too far, and could not be entered upon now, that it was a Satisfaction to her to have Di&s;cour&s;ed &s;o fully upon this Matter, that &s;he believed I knew her Mind, and that &s;he &s;aw nothing more to be done, but to &s;ettle a Method for the managing this Part at the Treaty of <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> which was approaching: But that in the mean time &s;he de&s;ired to go back to the Mat|ters which we were di&s;cour&s;ing of before, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Re&s;idence of the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and pre&s;t me that I would tell her what Place he &s;hould be &s;ent to, or moved to retreat to.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ently named <HI>Lorrain,</HI> as the mo&s;t convenient Place for him to retreat to on many Accounts, and particularly that it was the neare&s;t Neutral Place, being within two Days Journey of <HI>Paris;</HI> and as it was a Place where I knew the King had Intere&s;t &s;ufficient to oblige the Duke to give him a Re&s;idence, and to order him to be treated with a Re&s;pect &s;uitable to his Dignity; but I added that the King would by no means direct in that
<PB N="287" REF="286">
Ca&s;e, and de&s;ired her Ladyship to ob|&s;erve, that I had not the lea&s;t In&s;tructi|on to offer any Thing of that kind, but that I mentioned it meerly as the Re&s;ult of my own Thoughts, and de&s;ired if it was approved of, that the <HI>Chevalier</HI> might have Intimation from hence to ca&s;t his Eyes that Way, to which &s;he &s;aid no more, than that &s;he would ob&s;erve the di&s;tinction I had made between what I &s;aid with Direction, and what I &s;aid of my &s;elf, and that &s;he would concern her &s;elf to have him acquainted with the&s;e particulars, for that &s;he thought the Place would be very convenient on ma|ny Accounts.</P>
<P>She then told me, &s;he would be glad to con&s;ider with me what Method might be taken for the Management of this Af|fair during the Treaty. I replied, that this depended wholly upon her own Di|rections, and that &s;he had no more to do, but to give me her Commands to lay every Thing before her as the Treaty went on, which I would e&s;teem an Ho|nour too great to allow me to omit any Opportunity of giving her Satisfaction; and if to this I might add my humble Petition, it &s;hould be, that I might have the Honour to know from her, what her
<PB N="288" REF="287">
Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure was on any Article of Importance which might lead us into any Difficulty, I would take care that due regard &s;hould be had to all her Maje|&s;ty's Commands, and would endeavour to let her &s;ee how &s;incerely the King of <HI>France</HI> was di&s;po&s;ed to give her Maje&s;ty all po&s;&s;ible Satisfaction, not in this Ca&s;e only, but in every Thing el&s;e, in which her Intere&s;t or the Intere&s;t of her King|doms were concerned.</P>
<P>She received this with an Air of Sati&s;|faction that ea&s;ily di&s;covered it was what &s;he her &s;elf de&s;ired, telling me, that &s;he &s;hould be very glad of &s;uch a Corre&s;pondence, as the only way to bring the Thing in View to a rational Method of &s;ucceeding; and with this &s;he told me, &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me again in two or three Days, when we would &s;ettle a Method for Corre&s;ponding, and de&s;ired I would think of a Key for you Writing, that if any Letters should be intercepted, they might not be decipher'd or under&s;tood.</P>
<P>I beg'd it might be the next Night, if po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e it was more than Time that I should be in <HI>France;</HI> and that I under&s;tood her Maje&s;ty's Plenipotentia|ries

were already named, and would be at <HI>&V;trecht</HI> before it could be po&s;&s;ible for me to receive the King's In&s;tructions, and to give his Maje&s;ty an Account of my Negotiation.</P>
<P>Accordingly I waited on her the next Evening, without any Introductor, when &s;he received me with all the Civility, and in the mo&s;t obliging manner imagi|nable; &s;he told me &s;he had it in Charge to let me know how well I was with the Queen, and how agreeable it was to her Maje&s;ty to hear that I was to be at <HI>&V;trecht;</HI> And going to her Cabinet, &s;he called me to her, and pre&s;ented me in a Pur&s;e of Crim&s;on Velvet, made up like a Ca&s;e, and fa&s;ten'd with a Gold Cla&s;p, her Maje&s;ty's Picture &s;et round with Diamonds. I &s;tarted back a little, and offered to receive it on my Knee, which &s;he under&s;tood immediately, but would not &s;uffer me; <HI>For, Sir,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I do not tell you that the Queen pre|&s;ents you,</HI> but <HI>you may be a&s;&s;ured BY IT,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>how &s;atisfactory your Vi&s;its here have been,</HI> and how much I think it my Honour to Hand this Pre&s;ent to you.</P>
<P>Several Things pa&s;t at the &s;ame Time of Complement and Ceremony, rather
<PB N="290" REF="289">
than any Thing of Moment: After which I took my Leave, wondring with my &s;elf that &s;uch mean Things could be &s;aid of this Lady, as &s;ome have made publick; and I mu&s;t add, that &s;he &s;eem'd to me as worthy to be the Favourite of a Queen, as any Wo|man I have Convers'd with in my Life.</P>
<P>I had now no Vi&s;its to make, nor Au|dience of Leave to take, but of my Lord&mdash;my happy Corre&s;pondent, which I did the next Evening, and the Morning following took Po&s;t for <HI>Dover,</HI> having a Pa&s;s; and by that Means get|ting a Boat immediately; I landed at <HI>Calais</HI> the &s;ame Evening, and in three Days had the Honour to wait upon the King, and give him a full Account of all my Negotiations; with which, but e&s;pecially this la&s;t, his Maje&s;ty appear'd very well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>I had no Time to lo&s;e, and having the Honour of his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;i|on as Plenipotentiary; and having order|ed my Equipage to be got ready before, and to be &s;ent away, I &s;peeded after, and came to <HI>&V;trecht</HI> the 15th of <HI>January</HI> New Stile, as did al&s;o the Marquis <HI>de Huxelles</HI> and the Abbot <HI>Polignac,</HI> who

<P>I had not been long at <HI>&V;trecht</HI> before I perceiv'd there was a Defect &s;ome|where or other; for I could find no Effects of the Promi&s;es that had been made me, nor would the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini|&s;ters enter into any Conver&s;ation, <HI>much le&s;s</HI> Confidence upon the main Thing, which I expected: I mean as to the <HI>Che|valier.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="291">
I found the Mini&s;ters of the Allies &s;eem'd to pu&s;h that Point rather than the <HI>Briti&s;h:</HI> And there was nothing to be heard of among them, but of obli|ging <HI>France</HI> in the &s;olemne&s;t manner to Renounce him, Drive him out of the Kingdom; and if they had any Room for it, out of the World too: And the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;eem'd not &s;o much to Act in Concert with them, as to &s;tand in &s;ome Su&s;pen&s;e from the Vigour of the others in pu&s;hing that Affair; &s;o that we did not &s;tick to &s;ay, they were aw'd by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>This perplex'd me, becau&s;e I &s;aw evi|dently, that if we had no Path mark'd out by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plenipotentiaries, we could not interpo&s;e in that Affair in the lea&s;t; our Bu&s;ine&s;s being indeed to take our Mea&s;ures from them in every Thing; and to pre&s;s the main De&s;ign, <HI>(viz.) of making a Peace;</HI> &s;o that if they had no private In&s;tructions in favour of the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> there was no Remedy, but he would be intirely lo&s;t.</P>

<P><PB N="302" REF="301">
I had nothing to do, after I had recei|ved this Letter, but to Reflect how un|fortunate the Court of <HI>St. Germans</HI> was, and as I believe will ever be, in precipi|tating their own Affairs, and by their fol|lowing the ra&s;h Coun&s;els of tho&s;e about them, who are impatient of their Exile, tho' the King had done all that could be de&s;ired of him to make it ea&s;y to them; for it pre&s;ently o$cured to me, that this was &s;ome private Negotiation, which they had &s;et on Foot to en|gage &s;ome of the Mini&s;try in <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps <HI>the Trea&s;urer;</HI> many of whom, they vainly thought, would befriend them; whereas I &s;aw clearly when I was in <HI>England,</HI> that the Mini|&s;try there would give them Promi&s;es in Plenty; but not run the lea&s;t Hazard for them to do any Thing effectual; and that if any Dependance was upon them, they would certainly be deceived, after the greate&s;t Expectations, nay, and En|gagements too.</P>
<P>But I was a&s;toni&s;hed when I found, even the King him&s;elf, led into the Af|fair, and made to expect what I was &s;a|tisfied the People in <HI>England</HI> could not &s;o much as Promi&s;e, or indeed &s;peak of,
<PB N="303" REF="302">
but with the greate&s;t Caution, and at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance imaginable: For as I have ob&s;erv'd already, the Whigs watch'd the Mini&s;try &s;o narrowly, and charg'd them &s;o home, upon every Occa|&s;ion, whether ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly, with private Negotiations for the <HI>Chevalier;</HI> which was &s;o popular a Charge, and would &s;o effectually have ruin'd them, as Things then &s;tood, that <HI>I knew</HI> they dur&s;t not entertain any Di&s;cour&s;e of it; nay, they had &s;o little Confidence among&s;t them&s;elves, that in a Ca&s;e of &s;uch Con&s;e|quence, and &s;o Nice, they were jea|lous one of another, to the la&s;t Degree, and dur&s;t not Communicate their Thoughts to their be&s;t Friends.</P>
<P>As I had &s;everal Occa&s;ions to know this perfectly well, &s;o that I could not be deceiv'd; I was almo&s;t certain that whoever it was that had taken &s;o much Freedom with the King, had either im|pos'd upon him, or been greatly impo|&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>And yet it was the harde&s;t thing in the World, and the mo&s;t dangerous of its kind, to &s;ugge&s;t to the King, that his Maje&s;ty was wrong: So I had no more to do, but to wait a while, and
<PB N="304" REF="303">
&s;ay nothing, but what the King extorted from me: Every Letter I receiv'd had &s;omething in it of this kind, biding me expect every Po&s;t effectual Directions in the Affair of the <HI>Chevalier:</HI> But after &s;ome longer waiting, one of my Mi&s;&s;ives had this Expre&s;&s;ion from the King, <HI>viz. Either I am very ill&punc;&s;erv'd in</HI> England, <HI>or &s;omething will come effectually in a very lit|tle Time from thence.</HI></P>
<P>I thought now was a proper Sea&s;on to let his Maje&s;ty know, that the Affair of the <HI>Chevalier</HI> &s;uffered extremely for want of his Maje&s;ty's Return from <HI>Eng|land;</HI> and begg'd his Maje&s;ty would plea&s;e to give me his Commands, in Ca&s;e what he expected from <HI>England</HI> did not arrive; and then enclo&s;ed the Let|ter above, without any Reflections or Remarks at all of my own.</P>
<P>The King, as I heard afterwards, was exceedingly concerned when he &s;aw this Letter; and yet was loth to think it po&s;&s;ible that he could be deceiv'd: However it caus'd his Maje&s;ty to write in &s;uch a manner to tho&s;e Agents, <HI>who|ever they were</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> that they were forced to write back in plain Terms, The Mini&s;try in <HI>England</HI> were Men of no
<PB N="305" REF="304">
Honour, that they had held them in Su&s;pence a long Time; and that now they not only did not come to the Point with them, but declin'd any Conver&s;a|tion on the Subject; only &s;aid in gene|ral, that a certain Per&s;on would be &s;ent over to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> who &s;hould Di&s;cour&s;e by Word of Mouth freely, and &s;hould &s;et|tle that Affair &s;o as &s;hould be agreeable to all Parties: They made long Apolo|gies for their having been dup'd all along by tho&s;e who they had depended upon; and that it was none of their Fault.</P>
<P>The King did not &s;ay much, but he never forgave it them: And in his next Letter, his Maje&s;ty very pa&s;&s;ionately complain'd of his Misfortune, in having employ'd People who did not under&s;tand their Bu&s;ine&s;s; and charged me to try if I could renew that Affair again; for, <HI>as his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s it,</HI> I had left Things in a Way of Succe&s;s, but the&s;e Men had de&s;troyed it all again; and had now put it off to a remote Di&s;|cour&s;e, of a Per&s;on to be &s;ent to <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> they knew not when, or by whom.</P>

<P>I own'd to her, that it was rea&s;onable indeed to argue &s;o, but that as I had &s;e|cret Intelligence of a contrary De&s;ign; it was not improper for me to furni&s;h my &s;elf with Strength to prevent it: I repre&s;ented how di&s;honourable it would be to the King to have any &s;uch Condi|tions impo&s;ed upon him, or &s;o much as offer'd to him, that it was enough to en|gage
<PB N="319" REF="318">
him to abandon a Prince fled to his Court, which was always the A&s;y|lum of bani&s;h'd Princes, and the Refuge of the unfortunate; and that if he &s;hould be offer'd any thing farther, it would be neither more nor le&s;s than breaking off the Treaty, which we &s;hould be all very &s;orry for: But it was impo&s;&s;ible, that the King could bear Things &s;o un|worthy of him&s;elf as this would be: And I again excu&s;ed my being impatient on that Head, becau&s;e, as I had hinted to her before, I was a&s;&s;ured there was &s;ome|thing of that Nature upon the Anvil among the Allies, and we hoped her <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> would not permit them to have it in their Power a &s;econd Time to break off a Treaty, which was &s;o much for the good of all <HI>Europe,</HI> by in&s;i&s;ting upon Things di&s;honourable and impracticable for the King to grant.</P>
<P>I was very long and particular in my in&s;i&s;ting on this Head, which I did the rather, becau&s;e I was really allarm'd with an Intimation I had, that the Al|lies would in&s;i&s;t, that the King &s;hould confine the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and give him a kind of honourable Pri&s;on for Life, which would have been a Thing &s;o hor|rible in its Nature, and which the King
<PB N="320" REF="319">
would have receiv'd the Propo&s;al of with &s;o much di&s;dain, that it would have been the mo&s;t certain Way to have not only broken off the Treaty, but to have made the Breach between the King and Her Britannick Maje&s;ty more irreconci|lable than ever; and to have the War been more <HI>picquant</HI> again&s;t <HI>Britain,</HI> than again&s;t any other Part of the World: All which I fail'd not to repre&s;ent in ve|ry pre&s;&s;ing Terms, and &s;uch as, I thought, mu&s;t have extorted a &s;erious Reply; and therefore I was &s;urpri&s;ed in an extraor|dinary manner, when in her next Let|ter, wherein &s;he was very long, and even abu&s;ive in her Reflections upon &s;ome of the great Men in their own Court; She contented her&s;elf with &s;aying to all my Importunities above, that &s;he could not think I had any Rea|&s;on to be anxious upon that Affair at all.</P>
<P>It is true that either her Intelligence was much better than mine in that Part, or that, though &s;he was not willing to let me know any Thing of her Mea&s;ures, yet that &s;he did take effectual Care to put a &s;top to what I had been told was doing, for I heard no more of it, neither was any Thing of that kind offered at
<PB N="321" REF="320">
the Treaty; tho' in &s;pight of all my En|deavours or hers either; the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mi|ni&s;ters came without any He&s;itation in|to every Propo&s;al to make the <HI>Chevalier</HI>'s Ca&s;e de&s;perate, that any of the Allies could make them, and &s;eem'd to value them&s;elves upon their forwardne&s;s to do &s;o: And thus the Articles came to be loaded, as we now find them, with &s;o many impertinent Repetitions and Cir|cumlocutions, <HI>as we took them to be,</HI> for the binding the King never to e&s;pou&s;e the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> or concern him&s;elf in his Behalf.</P>
<P>There remain'd yet another Negotia|tion to be &s;et on Foot, which made me not re&s;ent the U&s;age abovemen|tioned, &s;o much, as otherwi&s;e I might perhaps have done, for I was real|ly di&s;gu&s;ted to the la&s;t Degree in my Thoughts; and this was, That an Ex|planation might be privately agreed up|on, for the declaring in what manner all the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions, which the King was thus to make, &s;hould be under&s;tood: And this was a Matter of &s;uch Moment to us, and which we found would be with &s;o much le&s;s Difficulty, pa&s;t with &s;ome People in <HI>England,</HI> that I thought it no de&s;pi&s;able Expedient, &s;eeing if tho&s;e De|clara|tions
<PB N="322" REF="321">
were made by the King, and we could get them accepted and &s;igned as a &s;eperate Article in <HI>England,</HI> his Maje&s;ty would then have the greater Freedom to Act as he &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e in Time to come.</P>
<P>I had drawn up the &s;eparate Article in as brief and conci&s;e a Manner as I could, and tran&s;mitted one Copy of it to the King, and another Copy to <HI>Eng|land</HI> in Terms like the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;That it is agreed, and his mo&s;t <HI>Chri|&s;tian Maje&s;ty</HI> hereby declares, on his own Part, That &s;o much of the &s;aid Ar|ticle as obliges him not to give any A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &amp;c. to the <HI>Chevalier de St. George</HI> and his Adherents &s;hall be un|der&s;tood; and is hereby declared on both Sides, to mean only for and du|ring the Life of her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, or any Heirs of her Body, and no long|er: And this Declaration and Explana|tion being made, and &s;igned the &s;ame Day with the &s;aid Treaty, &s;hall be ac|cepted as Part of the &s;ame to all In|tents and Purpo&s;es, as if it were In|corporated therein.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="322">
I receiv'd but very ambiguous An|&s;wers upon this Subject, for a great while, which made my Corre&s;pondence with my Friends in <HI>England,</HI> a little le&s;s Courtly, and le&s;s Plea&s;ant than u&s;ual, the Per&s;ons I &s;olicited on this Head, al|ways expre&s;s'd a great deal of good Will for the <HI>Chevalier</HI> and his Intere&s;t, and I believe were un&s;eignedly, and without Re&s;erve, de&s;irous of every Thing that might Contribute to it; but they were not without their Difficulties on &s;everal Accounts, and I believe, in &s;ome things, were not without their Jealou&s;ies one of another: Again, I often found they were not &s;o &s;ure of the Queen as they pretend|ed to be; and tho' they took a Freedom, <HI>e&s;pecially the Women,</HI> to talk Things at a Di&s;tance, which they really had on the Anvil of their own Management; yet when it came to the Point, they had not ripen'd the Queen up to their Lengths, nor were they able to bring to pa&s;s, what they had fancied was Ea&s;y; nay, even not in &s;uch Things as they had pretended they could undertake for.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t, I believe this was one, and I dare &s;ay, by what I perceiv'd after|wards, however hone&s;t they thought the
<PB N="324" REF="323">
Project of a Declaration, as above, was on the Side of the King of <HI>France,</HI> they could not entertain &s;uch a Notion of it on the Queen's Side, as to venture to propo&s;e it to her Maje&s;ty to Sign and Ex|change it.</P>
<P>To come off of this Difficulty, the next Letter I receiv'd about it, contain'd a long Apology for a Medium in the Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That they would receive &s;uch a De|claration on the King's Side; and the Queen might be told, that the King of <HI>France</HI> expected &s;o to be under&s;tood in all the Conce&s;&s;ions he &s;hould make, and that he would hold him&s;elf to be no far|ther oblig'd, than as this Declaration &s;hould expre&s;s; and that her Maje&s;ty ha|ving been made to know beforehand, how the King under&s;tood him&s;elf bound by the &s;aid Treaty, and how not; it would be &s;ufficient without Signing on her Part.</P>
<P>But as they thought the Queen had too much Re&s;pect to the Integrity of her Way of Treating, to Sign &s;uch an Article; &s;o I a&s;&s;ur'd them the King my Ma&s;ter was too Religious an Ob&s;erver of his own Obligations by Treaty, <HI>whatever &s;candalous Things they had &s;aid in</HI> Eng|land, to think him&s;elf di&s;engag'd by any
<PB N="325" REF="324">
thing, but her Maje&s;ty's accepting po&s;i|tively of his Signing under the Expla|nations mention'd; and that if the <HI>Che|valier</HI> was lo&s;t in the Nicety of this Di&s;|pute: I appeal'd to them, that it was at the Door of the People in <HI>England,</HI> who call'd them&s;elves his Friends, and that we were not to be blam'd, whatever might be the Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>But the Difficulty was too great for them, and they were oblig'd to acknow|ledge, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to get over it: They importun'd me long, that the Declaration might however be made of our Side, and that it &s;hould be of Signification or of no Signification, as the King &s;hould plea&s;e, unle&s;s the Queen might be brought to accept it: But the offer was &s;o below the known Ju&s;tice of his Maje&s;ty, that I dur&s;t no more offer it on tho&s;e Terms to the King, than they dur&s;t offer the other to the Queen: Upon the whole, they de&s;ired me to compleat the Article, and &s;ent it over, tho' un&s;ign'd, that they might have it ready to offer, if they found Room for it: This I could not refu&s;e, but could never get them one Step far|ther than this, that they dur&s;t not move it to the Queen.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="325">
However it was our Opinion, as well as theirs, That the King having made &s;uch a Declaration of his Meaning in the &s;aid Treaty, and that he would be un|der&s;tood to be no otherways bound by the Treaty, than &s;hould con&s;i&s;t with the &s;aid Explanation; it was &s;ufficient to ju|&s;tify his Maje&s;ty's entring upon Mea|&s;ures &s;uitable to the &s;aid Explanati|on, when a proper Sea&s;on &s;hould offer: But that mu&s;t be left to be decided ano|ther way, if the Debate ever comes up|on the Stage.</P>
