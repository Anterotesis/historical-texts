<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THE inimitable, and immortal, <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>, about a hun|dred and thirty Years &s;ince, wrote a Play, on this Subject, and call'd it, The <HI>Life</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI>, the <HI>Fifth:</HI> &mdash; Mine is a <HI>New Fabrick</HI>, yet I built
<PB REF="4">
on <HI>His</HI> Foundation; and the Rea|der, I am afraid, will, too ea&s;ily, di&s;cover, without the Help of a Com|pari&s;on, in what Places I am in|debted to him.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;s, which this Tragedy will meet with, on the Stage, is a Matter, of no Con&s;equence: If it were otherwi&s;e, I &s;hou'd be &s;orry, to have mi&s;taken, &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably, the Ta&s;te of the <HI>Fa&s;hionable!</HI> There is a Kind of <HI>Dumb Drama!</HI> a new, and wonderful, Di&s;covery! that pla|ces the <HI>Wit</HI> in the <HI>Heels!</HI> and the Experience of Both our Theatres might have taught any Writer, but &s;o dull a one as I am, that the <HI>Har|lequins</HI>
<PB REF="5">
are Gentlemen, of better In|tere&s;t than the <HI>Harrys</HI>.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ters of the Stage act, like very di&s;creet Judges: in falling in with a Humour, which they cou'd not have oppos'd but to their Di&s;ad|vantage. What have <HI>They</HI> to do with <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>, to whom <HI>Folly</HI> is mo&s;t profitable?&mdash; To &s;ail, with Wind, and Tide, is &s;afe&s;t, and mo&s;t ea&s;y: Nor is it any Part of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;tem the Current of the Times; and be <HI>Wi&s;e</HI>, with Empty Boxes.</P>
<P>No <HI>French Tricks</HI>, however, in the Days of <HI>my</HI> Hero, were able to
<PB REF="6">
&s;tand before him: Fortune favour'd him, <HI>then</HI>, again&s;t incredible Odds! and who knows, (if the Ladies will forgive me the Pre&s;umption of com|paring <HI>&s;mall</HI> Things with <HI>Great</HI>,) but he may, <HI>now</HI>, become a Match, even for <HI>Eunuchs</HI>, and <HI>Merry-An|drews!</HI></P>
<P>Yet, the Victory, at <HI>Agencourt</HI>, was an Action, not more wonder|ful! And it is, I fear, become im|po&s;&s;ible, &s;ince I have, imprudently, neglected to li&s;t tho&s;e Squadrons of <HI>light-arm'd</HI> Forces, which have, &s;o often, won the Day, for Our <HI>Lea|ders</HI>, in modern Poetry.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">How poor a Thing is <HI>Fame</HI>, when &s;o wretchedly <HI>caball'd</HI> for! It is hard to di&s;tingui&s;h, which is &s;trange&s;t, and mo&s;t ridiculous: the Noi&s;e, and Violence, of &s;uch Ap|plau&s;e, in its fir&s;t breaking out: or the Suddenne&s;s, with which it flat|tens, and leaves the Mon&s;ters <HI>a|ground!</HI> like that &s;traggling Shoal of <HI>Whales</HI>, which the Sea has, lately, lifted into the Meadows of <HI>Ham|borough</HI>.</P>
<P>After all, I am &s;anguine enough to hope, that a Ta&s;te for <HI>Tragedy</HI> may be re&s;tor'd:&mdash; Yet, who wou'd
<PB REF="8">
not de&s;pair of it, when It is de&s;ert|ed by tho&s;e Great Spirits, who&s;e pa&s;t Actions mu&s;t adorn it! &mdash;When a Name may be read, in the Li&s;t of <HI>Opera Directors</HI>, which will fur|ni&s;h the Poets, of Ages, yet to come, with as wonderful a Chara|cter! and with Conque&s;ts gain'd as nobly, over the <HI>French</HI>, and <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>, Arms, as any of the <HI>Ed|wards</HI>, or the <HI>Henrys</HI>, have left us, by the mo&s;t glorious of their anti|ent Victories!</P>
<P>But, in all Events, I will be Ea&s;y, who have no better Rea&s;on to wi&s;h well to Poetry, than my Love for
<PB REF="9">
a <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI>, I &s;hall never be <HI>married</HI> to: For, whenever I grow <HI>ambiti|ous</HI>, I &s;hall wi&s;h to <HI>build higher</HI>; and owe my <HI>Memory</HI> to &s;ome Oc|ca&s;ion, of more Importance, than my <HI>Writings</HI>.</P>
