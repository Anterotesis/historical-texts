<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF A <HI>TRIAL,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 4th of <HI>December</HI>, 1739, at nine o' Clock in the Morning, at the Sittings in the Court of <HI>King's Bench</HI> in <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI>, before the Right Honourable Sir <HI>William Lee</HI>, Knt. <HI>Lord Chief Ju&s;tice</HI> of that Court, came on a Trial by a Spe|cial Jury of Gentlemen, of another Cau&s;e, in which <HI>Theophilus Cibber</HI>, Gent. was Plaintiff, and <HI>William Sloper</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was Defendant.</P>
<P>The Council for the Plaintiff, were Mr. <HI>Solli|tor-General</HI>, Mr. <HI>Mar&s;h</HI>, Mr. <HI>Bootle</HI>, Mr. <HI>Henley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Town&s;hend</HI>. The Council for the De|fendant were Mr. <HI>Lloyd</HI>, Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI>, Mr. <HI>Mur|ray</HI>, Mr. <HI>Denni&s;on</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Barnardi&s;ton</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Town&s;hend</HI>, for the Plaintiff opened the Declaration, which was for Tre&s;spa&s;s and A&s;&s;ault, in taking, leading away, and detaining the Plain|tiff's
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Wife; and again, for a&s;&s;aulting, beat|ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Plaintiff's Wife, whereby he lo&s;t her A&s;&s;i&s;tance to his Damage of TEN THOU|SAND POUNDS.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sollicitor-General, (John Strange</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>) &s;tated the Ca&s;e for the Plaintiff; and (among other Things) took Notice,
<Q>&startq;That there had been another Trial la&s;t Year, for a criminal Conver&s;ation, in which the Plaintiff had a Verdict: That it might have been rea&s;onably expected the Defendant would have di&s;conti|nued his Acquaintance there; but it has un|happily proved otherwi&s;e: She has been &s;e|creted from her Husband in an ob&s;cure Part of the World, <HI>Kennington-lane</HI>, never went abroad, and has been there vi&s;ited by the Defendant Mr. <HI>Sloper:</HI> That after the former Verdict it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed they would act open|ly, or unguardedly, to be as liable to a De|tection, and manife&s;t Proof: That the Declara|tion therefore was only for detaining, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> therefore this pre&s;ent Trial was not likely to afford &s;o much Mirth and Entertainment to to the By&s;tanders as the former; but yet that they (<HI>viz.</HI> for the Plaintiff) &s;hould lay &s;uch an Evidence before the Jury, as &s;hould make it appear the Defendant did not keep her thus retired merely to look on: That if the Wo|man had been left to the Influence and prope$ Expo&s;tulations of her Husband (who has been ready to forgive and cheri&s;h her) &s;he migh$ have been reclaimed: but as the Defendant has not been deterred by the Verdict of la&s;$
<PB N="3" REF="4">
Year, here appears no Remedy again&s;t this Conduct, except another Verdict for &s;uch Damages as may be a &s;ufficient Warning to him; otherwi&s;e he may be willing to conti|nue this Commerce at the Expence of &s;ub|mitting to &s;mall Damages and Co&s;ts yearly. That the Plaintiff in wanting the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Wife, has lo&s;t her Salary of 200 <HI>l.</HI> &endq;a Year, and a Benefit worth 200 <HI>l.</HI> more.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Mar&s;h</HI>, on the &s;ame Side, &s;poke to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; and ob&s;erved, that every Body who had &s;een Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI> perform, mu&s;t know that &s;he is a Woman of an excellent Under|&s;tanding, or &s;he could never perform &s;o well: That this good Sen&s;e of hers mu&s;t have cau&s;ed or revived a Compunction in her for the fal&s;e Step &s;he had made, and have induced her to have been all Duty and Obedience to her Hu&s;|band, and to have u&s;ed double Diligence to have retrieved, or made &s;ome Amends for the Errors of her former Behaviour; if &s;he had not been &s;educed by the Defendant, who it &s;eems has too powerful an Influence over her.</P>
<P>Here Mrs. <HI>Bret</HI> was called to prove the Mar|riage: But Col. <HI>Moreton</HI>, acquaintaing his Lord|&s;hip that he had &s;ome call of a publick Nature $n another Place, was examined to Mr. <HI>Slo|$er</HI>'s Declarations; but the Colonel knew not $ $ny.

<STAGE>Mrs <HI>Sukey Smith</HI>, &s;worn.</STAGE>
<P>She confirmed what her Father and Mother had &s;worn, and gave an account of the taking the Lodging, and of Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI>'s coming there with a Maid (Mrs <HI>Allen</HI>,) and a Nur&s;e and Child about two Months old, named <HI>Mary</HI>: She de&s;cribed two Gardens belonging to the Hou&s;e, with a Sum|mer-hou&s;e and Arbour in them, which were all within the View of ten or twelve Windows of the Hou&s;e, from whence every Thing could be &s;een
<PB N="7" REF="8">
that was done: That one Mr <HI>Shaw</HI> a Surgeon, came there and fancied he knew Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI>. She al&s;o &s;aid, that &s;he &s;aw Mrs <HI>Archer</HI> write in a Book, which (&s;he believes) was the &s;ame which was pro|duced to her at the Trial: That the Child had the Small-pox and was attended by Mr <HI>Bli&s;&s;et</HI>, an A|pothecary; that in a few Days after Mr <HI>Shaw</HI> had been there, Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> came; and the next Day af|ter Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> had been there, Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI> went away.</P>
<STAGE>Mr <HI>Smith</HI> (the Son) &s;worn.</STAGE>
<P><HI>He agreed with the other Witne&s;&s;es, with this:</HI> I can give no Account of the Times of the Gentle|man's coming to vi&s;it, becau&s;e I generally &s;pent all the Day in the City: Sometimes when I came home at Night, I found him there; and he went away u&s;ually at ten at Night: I am &s;ure he never &s;taid later than eleven.
<STAGE>[<HI>Being asked as to his Opi|nion</HI>,]</STAGE>
At fir&s;t, by Rea&s;on of his frequent coming, I believed he was a young Gentleman of Fortune who had married her unknown to his Relations; but afterwards I began to alter my Opinion, becau&s;e he never lay in the Hou&s;e. Gentlemen, you may remember a Night of terrible Thunder and Light|ning la&s;t Summer, he happened to be there that Night, he went away in the Mid&s;t of that Wea|ther, though we pre&s;s'd him to &s;tay, and offered to get ready a Bed for him, but he went away, and I lent him my Great Coat.</P>
<P>This Witne&s;s gave an Account, how the Clerk of the Plaintiff's Attorney came there
<PB N="8" REF="9">
lately to make enquiry, per&s;onating the Defen|dant's Attorney, which the Court declared to be a foul Piece of Practice. The Plaintiff's Attor|ney &s;aid it was done without any Order from him, he knew nothing of it.</P>

<P>I am a Shoemaker. I went along with Mr <HI>Cibber</HI>. He went up Stairs directly. He &s;aid he came to de|mand his Wife, &s;he promi&s;ed to go. He took &s;ome Linnen and Apparrel; &s;he was in Bed, but we went out of the Room 'till &s;he was dre&s;s'd. He &s;aid he was to dine at the <HI>Rummer Tavern</HI> at two o'clock, and de&s;ired her to come to him there, and &s;aid &s;he &s;hould never want a Shilling while he had it.

<P>The Account Book was &s;hewn to him, he never had &s;een the Defendant write, any more than his Name &s;everal times, but had &s;ome Letters from him.

<P>It is here proper to let the Reader under&s;tand that this Tryal is not taken in the very Words at Length: as is &s;ometimes done, when a Short|hand Writer can be conveniently placed. But the Per&s;on who attended on this Occa&s;ion was at &s;uch Di&s;advantage, that he was forced to take it in an abridged Way; writing down the Sub&s;tance of it as well as he could: W$ thought good to mention this, that we may not be under&s;tood to impo&s;e on our Readers nor to injure the great Men concerned: W$ therefore hope that neither the learned Gen|tlemen at the Bar, nor the Court, will be of+fended, that we cannot do them full Ju&s;tice i$ Printing at Length the very good Argument on both Sides, and his Lord&s;hip's excellen$ Charge to the Jury.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="14">
it was impo&s;&s;ible to give a pecuniary Satisfac|tion adequate to the Injury: For that no Sum of Money could re&s;tore a Man's Tranquility of Mind. But that the Plaintiff mu&s;t re&s;t up|on &s;uch Remedy as the Law had given him.</P>
<P>He farther ob&s;erved (<HI>upon the Plaintiff's be|ing a Player</HI>) that 'tis true the Plaintiff was a Player, but he was al&s;o a Gentleman; being well de&s;cended and having had a liberal Edu|cation; that the Plaintiff him&s;elf was a very good Player; that his Father-was well known $o all Gentlemen, who delighted in Theatrical Entertainments to be of the fir&s;t Figure in that Profe&s;&s;ion, and an Author too; that the Plain|$iff's Grandfather was the be&s;t Statuary of his Time; and that the Plaintiff by the Mother's Side, was related to <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham:</HI> and $n right of that Pedigree, had received his Edu|cation upon a Foundation of that great Man.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he knew it was attempted by $ome, to have the Players con&s;idered in a Mat|$er of this Nature, as not upon the &s;ame $ooting with the re&s;t of the Subjects; as if it were more lawful to invade their Properties, $han tho&s;e of other People; but he knew no $aw that deprived them of tho&s;e Comforts, or $f tho&s;e Rights which other Subjects ought to $njoy: That the Stage had been cheri&s;hed $nd encouraged by the Polite&s;t and Wi&s;e&s;t $tates, as a School of Virtue and good Morals; $nd that many received good Le&s;&s;ons and Im|$re&s;&s;ions from what they hear at the <HI>Theatre</HI>;

<P>That there had been a good deal of Pains taken to &s;pread a Report about Town as if the Plaintiff had been con&s;enting to the Wrong the Defendant had done him; but this was only to bla&s;t the Credit of the Plaintiff's Cau&s;e be|fore the Trial; and that it might come with Prejudice before the Jury.

That Love is the mo&s;t govern|ing Pa&s;&s;ion in human Nature; that as it is &s;o all Theatrical Performances abound with it; that they cannot expect to plea&s;e without it: That a very wi&s;e and mode&s;t Man who hath wrote one of the be&s;t Plays extant, could not depend on his Hero for Succe&s;s; that he was forced to interlard it with Love Scenes, or it might probably have been damned the fir&s;t Night; and this is the Tragedy of <HI>Cato</HI>. That the Hero of this Piece, that very <HI>Cato</HI>, the greate&s;t Man of the Time he lived in; is re|corded in Hi&s;tory to have had very free Notions of Love and Matrimony; that he lent his Wife to a Friend to breed out of her, and when they had done, he took her back again, very well contented.

<P>I will tell you all I know o$ the Matter. I do not fear my Character; ther$ are enough in Court that will give me a ver$ good Character. It was about <HI>March</HI> wa$ Twelve-month that Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> u&s;ed fir&s;t t$ come to our Hou&s;e to Mr <HI>Cibber</HI>'s: The Ser+vants did not know who he was; but my Ma+&s;ter called him Mr <HI>Benefit</HI>, and u&s;ed to &s;ay h$ was a <HI>Romp</HI>, and a <HI>good-natured Boy</HI>. Mr <HI>Cib+ber</HI> was then very bare of Money, and afrai$ of his Creditors. I was very &s;orry for it; &s;$ he owed me a good deal of Money, and do &s;o &s;till. But one Day he told me: <HI>Anne</HI>, &s;ay he, I &s;hall have a good deal of Money &s;oo$
<PB N="27" REF="36">
and you &s;hall have &s;ome. And I know he &s;oon after had a good deal of Money, and he paid me five Guineas. That Summer we went to lodge at <HI>King&s;ton</HI>, and Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> with us. My Ma&s;ter u&s;ed often to leave Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> and my Mi&s;tre&s;s at Home, and go a Riding or Abroad, &s;ome where or other. The re&s;t of the Servants wondered at it as well as I; but I knew no Harm. They did not know Mr <HI>Slo|per</HI>'s Name. My Ma&s;ter called him his Cou&s;in <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI>. Afterwards when they came to Town, I left the Service, and took that Lodg|ing. In la&s;t Spring, about <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, I lived with them again. My Ma&s;ter took me a&s;ide, and made me promi&s;e Secrecy concerning &s;ome|thing he was about to &s;ay to me. He told me he was going to <HI>France:</HI> That there was an Affair between Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> and his Wife: That he was ruined for ever if it &s;hould be publickly known. And he made me promi&s;e to live with her till he &s;hould come back, that the re&s;t of the Servants might not know any thing of the Matter. I promi&s;ed him. They took Lodg|ings at <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI>, and my Ma&s;ter went to <HI>France</HI> in <HI>March or April</HI>. He was &s;ome Weeks gone, and in his Ab&s;cence Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> was commonly at the Lodgings at <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI>. When my Ma&s;ter came back he was at a Bag|$io in <HI>Goodman's Fields</HI>, and &s;ent Word to my Mi&s;tre&s;s. Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> was not then at <HI>Ken&s;ing|ton</HI>. My Mi&s;tre&s;s and I went to <HI>Goodman's Fields</HI> in a Hackney Coach, and he came back
<PB N="28" REF="37">
with us to <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI>. In our Return w$ changed our Coach two or three times by th$ Way, that he might not be di&s;covered. Sh$ told him, &s;he expected Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> in a Day o$ two. My Ma&s;ter &s;aid he would take a Lodg+ing when Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> came; or if there was no time for that, he would go lie at &s;ome Inn i$ the Town. Within two or three Days Mr <HI>Slo+per</HI> came; and then Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;ent and took a Lodging at <HI>Blue-Green</HI>, and after Supper about nine or ten o'Clock he went there, with a Ma$ carrying a Lanthorn and Candle, and left Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> and Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> at the Lodgings at <HI>Ken|&s;ington</HI>. He came back to Breakfa&s;t nex$ morning, and dined, and I believe &s;upped; and &s;o he did &s;everal Days, till Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> went a|way; and then Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> paid off the Lod|gings at <HI>Blue-Green</HI>, and came to the Lod|gings in <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> to his Wife.</P>

Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI> u&s;ed to undre&s;s her&s;elf in my Ma&s;ter's Room, and leave her Clothes there, and put on a Bed|gown, and take away one of the Pillows from my Ma&s;ter's Bed, and go away to Mr <HI>Sloper</HI>'s

<PB N="31" REF="40">
but would have been better entitled to $laim that Alliance if he had ob&s;erved <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham</HI>'s Motto, that <HI>Morals make the Man</HI>. The Words are <HI>Manners make the Man</HI>; but <HI>Manners</HI> are there intended to &s;ig|$ify <HI>Morals</HI>.</P>
<P>That upon the whole of the Evidence, (he $he Council) was afraid that the Plaintiff's Wife and the Defendant had gone beyond the $ounds of Duty; but whatever had pa&s;&s;ed, $ppeared not only to have been with the Plain|$ff's Con&s;ent, but even to have been concert|$d by him. That the Defendant was a young $entleman of Fortune, who became acquaint|$d with a Player and his Wife: That &s;he being di&s;tre&s;s of the alluring Arts of the Stage, fir&s;t $gages the young Gentleman's Affection and $aws him in, and this with the Hu&s;band's $tivity and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. For the Plaintiff conceals $e Defendant's true Name from the Know|$dge of the Servants; at one place he calls him $ou&s;in <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI>; at another, Mr <HI>Benefit</HI>; a $t Name, taken from a particular Night in $e Year when they get a great deal of money. $he Plaintiff tells the Servants the Defendant a <HI>Romp</HI>, and <HI>a good natur'd Boy</HI>; and he $akes a Boy of him. He takes his Money, $s him maintain his Family, re&s;igns his Wife him; and then comes to a Court of Ju&s;tice, $d to a Jury of Gentlemen for Reparation in $amages. The Council further repre&s;ented, at it would be of the utmo&s;t ill Con&s;equence,
<PB N="32" REF="41">
if it &s;hould once come to be under&s;tood in the World, that two artful People, being Hu&s;band and Wife, might lay a Snare for the Affection of an unwary young Gentleman, take a Su$ of Money from him, and when he woul$ part with no more, then come for a &s;econ$ Sum to a Court of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>That he (the Council) de&s;ired to be un|der&s;tood as by no means an Advocate for th$ Immorality of the Action; but this is not Pro&s;ecution for the Publick, or to puni&s;h th$ Immorality: This is only a Que&s;tion whether the Defendant has injur'd the Plaintiff; and certainly the Plaintiff cannot be injured, if h$ has not only con&s;ented, but has even taken Price.</P>
<P>However if it &s;hould be thought requi&s;it$ to find a Verdict for the Plaintiff; we had not a Denomination of Coin &s;mall enough to be given him in Damages.</P>
<P>Mr Sollicitor General in his Reply, ob&s;erve the ill Con&s;equence of letting it pa&s;s for a La$ that Men might &s;ell their Wives, which wo$ be the Con&s;equence of giving a Verdict $ the Defendant.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip &s;ummed up the Evidence,</P>
