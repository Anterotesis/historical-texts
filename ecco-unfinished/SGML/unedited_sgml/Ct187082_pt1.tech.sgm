<P>THE hi&s;torian of human life finds le&s;s of diffi|culty
and of intricacy to develop, in its accidents and
adventures, than the inve&s;tigator of the human heart
in its feelings and its changes. In vain may For|tune
wave her many-coloured banner, alternately re|galing
and di&s;maying, with hues that &s;eem glowing
with all the creation's felicities, or with tints that ap|pear
&s;tained with ingredients of unmixt horrors: her
mo&s;t rapid vici&s;&s;itudes, her mo&s;t una&s;&s;imilating ec|centricities,
are mocked, laughed at, and di&s;tanced
by the wilder wonders of the Heart of man; that
amazing a&s;&s;emblage of all po&s;&s;ible contrari$ties, in
which one thing alone is &s;teady&mdash;the perver&s;ene&s;s of
&s;pirit which grafts de&s;ire on what is denied. Its
qualities are indefinable, its re&s;ources unfathomable,
its weakne&s;&s;es indefen&s;ible. In our neighbours we
cannot judge, in our&s;elves we dare not tru&s;t it. We
lo&s;e ere we learn to appreciate, and ere we can com|prehend
it we mu&s;t be born again. Its capacity
o'er-leaps all limit, while its futility includes every
ab&s;urdity. It lives its own &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;it cea&s;es to
beat&mdash;and the void is in&s;crutable! In one grand and
general view, who can di&s;play &s;uch a portrait? Fair|ly,
however faintly, to delineate &s;ome of its features,
is the &s;ole and di&s;criminate province of the pen
which would trace nature, yet blot out per&s;onality.</P>

<P>REPOSE is not more welcome to the worn and
to the aged, to the &s;ick and to the unhappy, than
danger, difficulty, and toil to the young and adven|turous.
Danger they encounter but as the fore-run|ner
of &s;ucce&s;s; difficulty, as the &s;pur of ingenuity;
and toil, as the herald of honour. The experience
which teaches the le&s;&s;on of truth, and the ble&s;&s;ings of
tranquillity, comes not in the &s;hape of warning nor
of wi&s;dom; from &s;uch they turn a&s;ide, defying or
di&s;believing. 'Tis in the bitterne&s;s of per&s;onal proof
alone, in &s;uffering and in feeling, in erring and in re|penting,
that experience comes home with convicti|on,
or impre&s;&s;es to any u&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the bo&s;om of her re&s;pectable family re&s;ided
Camilla. Nature, with a bounty the mo&s;t profu&s;e,
had been lavi&s;h to her of attractions; Fortune, with
a moderation yet kinder, had placed her between lux|ury
and indigence. Her abode was in the par&s;on|age-hou&s;e
of Etherington, beautifully &s;ituated in the
unequal county of Hamp&s;hire, and in the vicinity of
the varied land&s;capes of the New Fore&s;t. Her fa|ther,
the rector, was the younger &s;on of the hou&s;e of
Tyrold. The living, though not con&s;iderable, en|abled
its incumbent to attain every rational object of
his mode&s;t and circum&s;cribed wi&s;hes; to be&s;tow upon
a de&s;erving wife whatever her own forbearance de|clined
not; and to educate a lovely race of one &s;on
and three daughters, with that expan&s;ive propriety,
which unites improvement for the future with pre&s;ent
enjoyment.</P>
<P>In goodne&s;s of heart, and in principles of piety,
this exemplary couple was bound to each other by
<PB N="7" REF="7">
the mo&s;t perfect $ui&s;on of character, though in their
tempers there was a contra&s;t which had &s;carce the
gradation of a &s;ingle &s;hade to &s;mooth off its abrupt
di&s;&s;imilitude. Mr. Tyrold, gentle with wi&s;dom, and
benign in virtue, &s;aw with compa&s;&s;ion all imperfecti|ons
but his own, and there doubled the &s;everity
which to others he &s;pared. Yet the mildne&s;s that
urged him to pity blinded him not to approve; his
equity was unerring, though his judgment was in|dulgent.
His partner had a firmne&s;s of mind which
nothing could &s;hake: calamity found her re&s;olute;
even pro&s;perity was powerle&s;s to lull her duties a&s;leep.
The exalted character of her hu&s;band was the pride
of her exi&s;tence, and the &s;ource of her happine&s;s.
He was not merely her &s;tandard of excellence, but
of endurance, &s;ince her &s;en&s;e of his worth was the
criterion for her opinion of all others. This in&s;ti|g$ted
a &s;pirit of compari&s;on, which is almo&s;t always
uncandid, and which here could rarely e&s;cape proving
injurious. Such, at its very be&s;t, is the un&s;kilful|ne&s;s
of our fallible nature, that even the noble prin|ciple
which impels our love of right, mi&s;leads us but
into new deviations, when its ambition pre&s;umes to
point at perfection. In this in&s;tance, however, di&s;|tinctne&s;s
of di&s;po&s;ition &s;ti&s;led not r$$iprocity of af|fection
&mdash;that magnetic concentration of all marriage
felicity;&mdash;Mr. Tyrold revered while he &s;oftened the
rigid virtues of his wife, who adored while &s;he forti|fied
the melting humanity of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Thus, in an interchange of happine&s;s the mo&s;t de|&s;erved,
and of parental occupations the mo&s;t promi&s;|ing,
pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t married years of this ble&s;t and
ble&s;&s;ing pair. An event then came to pa&s;s ex|tremely
intere&s;ting at the moment, and yet more im|portant
in its con&s;equences. This was the receipt of
a letter from the elder brother of Mr. Tyrold, con|taining
information that he meant to remove into
Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh Tyrold was a baronet, who re&s;ided up|on
the hereditary e&s;tate of the family in York&s;hire.
He was many years older than Mr. Tyrold, who had
<PB N="8" REF="8">
never &s;een him &s;ince his marriage; religious duties,
prudence, and dome&s;tic affairs having from that pe|riod
detained him at his benefice; while a pa&s;&s;ion
for field &s;ports had, with equal con&s;tancy, kept his
brother &s;tationary.</P>
<P>The baronet began his letter with kind enquiries
after the welfare of Mr. Tyrold and his family, and
then entered upon the &s;tate of his own affairs, briefly
narrating, &startq;that he had lo&s;t his health, and, not
knowing what to do with him&s;elf, had re&s;olved to
change his habitation, and &s;ettle near his relations.
The Cleves' e&s;tate, which he heard was ju&s;t by
Etherington, being then upon &s;ale, he de&s;ired his
brother to make the purcha&s;e for him out of hand;
and then to prepare Mrs. Tyrold, with whom he
was yet unacquainted, though he took it for
granted &s;he was a woman of great learning, to re|ceive
a mere poor country '&s;quire, who knew no
more of hic, haec, $oc, than the baby unborn. He
be$ged him to provide a proper apartment for their
niece Indiana Lynmere, whom he &s;hould bring
with him, and another for their nephew Clermont,
who was to follow at the next holidays; and not
to forget Mrs. Margland, Indiana's governe&s;s, &s;he
being rather the mo&s;t particular in point of plea&s;ing
among&s;t them.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, extremely gratified by this unex|pected
renewal of fraternal intercour&s;e, wrote the
warme&s;t thanks to his brother, and executed the com|mi&s;&s;ion
with the utmo&s;t alacrity. A noble man&s;ion,
with an exten&s;ive plea&s;ure ground, &s;carce four miles
di&s;tant from the par&s;onage-hou&s;e of Etherington,
was bought, &s;itted up, and made ready for his re|ception
in the cour&s;e of a few months. The ba|ronet,
impatient to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new ter|ritory,
arrived &s;peedily after, with his niece Indiana,
and was welcomed at the gate of the park by Mr.
Tyrold and his whole family.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh Tyrold inherited from his ance&s;tors an
unincumbered e&s;tate of &pound;. 5000 per annum; which
he enjoyed with ea&s;e and affluence to him&s;elf, and
<PB N="9" REF="9">
di&s;&s;eminated with a good will &s;o generous, that he
appeared to think his per&s;onal pro&s;perity, and that
of all who &s;urrounded him, be&s;towed but to be &s;hared
in common, rather from general right, than through
his own di&s;pen&s;ing bounty. His temper was unalter|ably
&s;weet, and every thought of his brea&s;t was laid
open to the world with an almo&s;t inf$ntine artle&s;&s;ne&s;s.
But his talents bore no proportion to the goodne&s;s of
his heart, an in&s;uperable want of quickne&s;s, and of
application in his early days, having l$ft him, at a
later period, wholly uncultivated, and &s;ingularly &s;elf|formed.</P>
<P>A dearth of all &s;edentary re&s;ources became, when
his youth pa&s;&s;ed away, his own con&s;tant reproach.
Health failed him in the meridian of his life, from
the con&s;equences of a wound in his &s;ide, occa&s;ioned
by a fall from his hor&s;e; exerci&s;e, therefore, and
active diver&s;ions, were of nece&s;&s;ity relinqui&s;hed&punc; and
as the&s;e had hitherto occupied all his time, except
that portion which he delighted to devote to ho&s;|pitality
and neighbourly offices, now equally beyond
his &s;trength, he found him&s;elf at once deprived of
all employment, and de&s;titute of all comfort. Nor
did any plan occur to him to &s;olace his misfortunes,
till he accidentally read in the new&s;papers that the
Cleves' e&s;tate was upon &s;ale.</P>
<P>Indiana, the niece who accompanied him, a beau|tiful
little girl, was the $word$ daughter of a de|cea&s;ed
&s;i&s;ter, who, at the death of her parents, had,
with Clermont, an only brother, been left to the
guardian&s;hip of Sir Hugh; with the charge of a
&s;mall e&s;tate for the &s;on of $word$ &pound;. 200 a-year, and
the &s;um of &pound;. 1000 for the fortune of the daughter.</P>
<P>The meeting was a &s;ource of tender plea&s;ure to
Mr. Tyroll; and gave birth in his young family to
that eager joy which is &s;o naturally attached, by our
happie&s;t early prejudices, to the fir&s;t &s;ight of near
$word$. Mrs. Tyrold received Sir Hugh with the
$word$ due to the brother of her hu&s;band; who
now $word$ higher than ever in her e&s;timation, from a
frat$r$al compari&s;on to the unavolidable di&s;advantage
<PB N="10" REF="10">
of the baronet; though &s;he was not in&s;en&s;ible to the
fair future pro&s;pects of her children, which &s;eemed
the probable re&s;ult of his change of abode.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding his be&s;t affec|tions
were all opened by the &s;ight of &s;o many claimants
to their kindne&s;s, was the only dejected per&s;on of
the group.</P>
<P>Though too good in his nature for envy, a &s;evere
&s;elf-upbraiding followed his view of the happine&s;s of
his brother; he regretted he had not married at the
&s;ame age, that he might have owned as fine a family,
and repined again&s;t the unfortunate privileges of his
birth-right, which, by indulging him in his fir&s;t
youth with whatever he could covet, drove from his
attention that mode&s;t &s;ore&s;ight, which prepares for
later years the con&s;olation they are &s;ure to require.</P>
<P>By degrees, however, the &s;atisfaction &s;pread
around him found &s;ome place in his own brea&s;t, and
he acknowledged him&s;elf &s;en&s;ibly revived by &s;o en|dearing
a reception; though he candidly avowed,
that if he had not been at a lo&s;s what to do, he
&s;hould never have had a thought of taking &s;o long a
journey. &startq;But the not having made,&endq; cried he,
&startq;the proper proficiency in my youth for the filling
up my time, has put me quite behind-hand.&endq;</P>
<P>He care&s;&s;ed all the children with great fondne&s;s,
and was much &s;truck with the beauty of his three
nieces, particularly with that of Camilla, Mr. Ty|rold's
&s;econd daughter; &startq;yet &s;he is not,&endq; he cried,
&startq;&s;o pretty as her little &s;i&s;ter Eugenia, nor much
better than t'other &s;i&s;ter Lavinia; and not one of the
three is half &s;o great a beauty as my little Indiana;
&s;o I can't well make out what it is that's &s;o catching
in her; but there's &s;omething in her little mouth
that quite wins me; though &s;he looks as if &s;he was
half laughing at me too: which can't very well be,
neither; for I &s;uppo&s;e, as yet, at lea&s;t, &s;he knows
no more of books and &s;tudying than her uncle. And
that's little enough, God knows, for I never took to
them in proper &s;ea&s;on; which I have been &s;orry
enough for, upon coming to di&s;cretion.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="11">
Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the boy, he exhorted
him to work hard while yet in his youth, and re|lated
&s;undry anecdotes of the indu&s;try and merit of
his father when at the &s;ame age, though left quite to
him&s;elf, as, to his great misfortune, he had been
al&s;o, &startq;which brought about,&endq; he continued, &startq;my
being this pre&s;ent <HI>ignoramus</HI> that you &s;ee me; which
would not have happened, if my good forefathers
had been plea&s;ed to keep a &s;harper look out upon my
education.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel, the little boy, ca&s;ting a comic glance at
Camilla, begged to know what his uncle meant by a
&s;harper look out?</P>
<P>&startq;Mean, my dear? why correction to be &s;ure;
for all that, they tell me, is to be done by the rod;
&s;o there, at lea&s;t, I might have &s;tood as good a chance
as my neighbours.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And pray, uncle,&endq; cried Lionel, pur&s;ing up his
mouth to hide his laughter, &startq;did you always like
the thoughts of it &s;o well?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why no, my dear, I can't pretend to that; at
your age I had no more ta&s;te for it than you have:
but there's a proper &s;ea&s;on for every thing. How|ever,
though I tell you this for a warning, perhaps
you may do without it; for, by what I hear, the
ri&s;ing generation's got to a much greater pitch &s;ince
my time.&endq;</P>
<P>He then added, he mu&s;t advi&s;e him, as a friend,
to be upon his guard, as his co$&s;in, Clermont Lyn|mere,
who was coming home from Eton &s;chool next
Chri&s;tmas for the holidays, would turn out the very
mirror of &s;cholar&s;hip; for he had given directions to
have him &s;tudy both night and day, except what
might be taken off for eating and &s;leeping: &startq;Be|cau&s;e,&endq;
he continued, &startq;having proved the bad of
knowing nothing in my own ca&s;e, I have the more
right to intermeddle with others. And he will thank
me enough when once he has got over his cla&s;&s;ie$.
And I hope, my dear little boy, you &s;ee it in the
&s;ame light too; which, however, is what I can't
expect.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="12">
The hou&s;e was now examined; the fair little In|diana
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her apartment; Mi&s;s Mar|gland
was &s;atisfied with the attention that had been
paid her; and Sir Hugh was rejoiced to find a room
for Clermont that had no window but a &s;kylight, by
which means his &s;tudies, he ob&s;erved, would receive
no interruption from gaping and &s;taring about him.
And, when the night advanced, Mr. Tyrold had the
happine&s;s of leaving him with &s;ome pro&s;pect of re|covering
his &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The revival, however, la&s;ted but during the no|velty
of the &s;cene; depre&s;&s;ion returned with the
feelings of ill health; and the happier lot of his
brother, though born to almo&s;t nothing, filled him
with ince&s;&s;ant repentance of his own mi&s;management.</P>
<P>In &s;ome mea&s;ure to atone for this, he re&s;olved to
collect him&s;elf a family in his own hou&s;e; and the
young Camilla, who&s;e dawning archne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion
had in&s;tinctively caught him, he now demanded of
her parents, to come and re&s;ide with him and Indiana
at Cleves; &startq;for certainly,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;for &s;uch a
young little thing, &s;he looks full of amu&s;ement.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold objected again&s;t repo&s;ing a tru&s;t &s;o pre|cious
where its value could &s;o ill be appreciated. Ca|milla
was, in &s;ecret, the fonde&s;t hope of her mother,
though the rigour of her ju&s;tice &s;carce permitted the
partiality to beat even in her own brea&s;t. Nor did
the happy little per&s;on need the avowed di&s;tinction.
The tide of youthful glee flowed jocund from her
heart, and the tran&s;parency of her fine blue veins
almo&s;t &s;hewed the velocity of its current. Every
look was a &s;mile, every &s;tep was a &s;pring, every
thought was a hope, every feeling was joy! and the
early felicity of her mind was without allay. O
bli&s;sful &s;tate of innocence, purity, and delight, why
mu&s;t it fleet &s;o fa&s;t? why &s;carcely but by retro&s;pection
is its happine&s;s known?</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, while his tendere&s;t hopes encircled
the &s;ame object, &s;aw the propo&s;al in a &s;airer light,
from the love he bore to his brother. It &s;eemed
certain &s;uch a re&s;idence would &s;ecure her an ample
<PB N="13" REF="13">
fortune; the governe&s;s to whom Indiana was en|tru&s;ted
would take care of his little girl; though re|moved
from the hou$ly in&s;tructions, &s;he would &s;till
be within reach of the general &s;uperintendance of
her mother, into who&s;e power he ca&s;t the uncon|trolled
liberty to reclaim her, if there &s;tarted any
occa&s;ion. His children had no provi&s;ion a&s;certained,
&s;hould his life be too &s;hort to fulfil his own per&s;onal
&s;chemes of economy in their favour: and while to
an argument &s;o incontrovertible Mrs. Tyrold was
&s;ilent, he begged her al&s;o to reflect, that, per&s;ua&s;ive
as were the attractions of elegance and re&s;inement,
no ju&s;t parental expectations could be e&s;&s;entially di&s;|appointed,
where the great moral l$&s;&s;ons were prac|tically
inculcated, by a uniform view of goodne&s;s of
heart, and firmne&s;s of principle. The&s;e his brother
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an eminent degree; and if his character
had nothing more from which their daughter could
derive benefit, it undoubtedly had not a point from
which &s;he could receive injury.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold now yielded; &s;he never re&s;i&s;ted a re|mon&s;trance
of her hu&s;band; and as her &s;en&s;e of duty
impelled her al&s;o never to murmur, &s;he retired to her
own room, to conceal with how ill a grace &s;he com|plied.</P>
<P>Had this lady been united to a man whom &s;he
de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;he would yet have obeyed him, and as
&s;crupulou&s;ly, though not as happily, as &s;he obeyed
her honoured partner. She con&s;idered the vow taken
at the altar to her hu&s;band, as a voluntary ve&s;tal
would have held one taken to her Maker; and no
di&s;&s;ent in opinion exculpated, in her mind, the lea&s;t
deviation from his will.</P>
<P>But here, where an admiration almo&s;t adoring was
fixt of the character to which &s;he &s;ubmitted, &s;he was
&s;ure to applaud the motives which &s;wayed him, how|ever
little their con&s;equences met her &s;entiments:
and even where the contrariety was wholly repugnant
to her judgment, the genuine warmth of her ju&s;t
affection made every compliance, and every forbear|ance,
not merely exempt from pain, but, if to
<PB N="14" REF="14">
him any &s;atisfaction, a &s;acrifice &s;oothing to her
heart.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, who&s;e whole &s;oul was deeply affected
by her excellencies, gratefully felt his power, and
religiou&s;ly &s;tudied not to abu&s;e it: he re&s;pected what
he owed to her con&s;cience, he tenderly returned
what he was indebted to her affection. To render
her virtues conducive to her happine&s;s, to &s;often her
duties by the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of their merit, were the
fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;acred objects of his &s;olicitude in life.</P>
<P>When the lively and lovely little girl, mingling the
tears of &s;eparation with all the childi&s;h rapture which
novelty, to a much later period in&s;pires, was prepar|ing
to change her home, &startq;Remember,&endq; cried Mr.
Tyrold, to her anxious mother, &startq;that on you, my
Georgiana, devolves the &s;ole charge, the unlimited
judgment, to again bring her under this roof, the
fir&s;t moment &s;he appears to you in any danger from
having quitted it.&endq;</P>
<P>The prompt and thankful acceptance of Mrs. Ty|rold
did ju&s;tice to the &s;incerity of this offer: and the
cheerful acquie&s;cence of le&s;&s;ened reluctance, rai&s;ed
her higher in that e&s;teem to which her con&s;tant mind
invariably looked up, as the &s;ummit of her cho&s;en
ambition.</P>

<P>DELIGHTED with this acqui&s;ition to his
hou&s;ehold, Sir Hugh again revived. &startq;My dear
brother and &s;i&s;ter,&endq; he cried, when next the family
vi&s;ited Cleves, &startq;this proves the mo&s;t fortunate &s;t$p
I have ever taken &s;ince I was born. Camilla's a little
jewel; &s;he jumps and &s;kips about till &s;he makes my
eyes ache with looking after her, $word$ fear of her
breaking her neck. I mu&s;t keep a $arp watch, or
&s;he'll put poor Indiana's no&s;e quite out of joint, which
<PB N="15" REF="15">
God forbid. However, &s;he's the life of us all, for
I'm &s;orry to &s;ay it, but I think, my dear brother,
poor Indiana promi&s;es to turn out rather dull.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;prightly little girl, thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the heart,
&s;oon guided the will of her uncle. He could refu&s;e
nothing to her endearing $ntreaty, and felt every in|dulgence
repaid by the enchantment of her gaiety.
Indiana, his fir&s;t idol, lo&s;t her power to plea&s;e him,
though no e&s;&s;ential kindne&s;s was abated in his con|duct.
He &s;till acknowledged that her beauty was the
mo&s;t complete; but he &s;ound in Camilla a variety
that was captivation. Her form and her mind were
of equal ela&s;ticity. Her playful countenance re|kindled
his &s;pirits, the cheerfulne&s;s of her animated
voice awakened him to its own joy. He douted upon
detaining her by his &s;ide, or delighted to gratify her
if &s;he wi&s;hed to be ab&s;ent. She exhilarated him with
plea&s;ure, &s;he &s;upplied him with id$ns, and from the
morning's fir&s;t dawn to the evening's late&s;t clo&s;e, his
eye followed her light-&s;pringing figure, or his ear
vibrated with her &s;portive &s;ounds; catching, as it
li&s;tened, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive rotation, the &s;pontaneous laugh,
the uncon&s;cious bound, the genuine glee of child|hood's
fearle&s;s happine&s;s, uncu$bed by &s;everity, un|tamed
by misfortune.</P>
<P>This a&s;cendance was &s;oon pointed out by the &s;er|vants
to Indiana, who &s;ometimes &s;hewed her re&s;ent|ment
in unexplained and p$uting fullenne&s;s, and at
others, let all pa&s;s unnoticed, with unreflecting for|getfulne&s;s.
But her mind was &s;oon empoi&s;oned with
a jealou&s;y of more permanent &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s; in le&s;s than
a month after the re&s;idence of Camilla at Cleves, Sir
Hugh took the re&s;olution of making her his heire&s;s.</P>
<P>Even Mr. Tyrold, notwith&s;tanding his fondne&s;s
for Camilla, remon&s;trated again&s;t a partiality &s;o in|jurious
to his nephew and niece, as well as to the
re&s;t of his family. And Mrs. Tyrold, though her
&s;ecret heart &s;ub&s;cribed, without wonder, to a pre|dilection
in favour of Camilla, was maternally di&s;|turbed
for her other children, and felt her ju&s;tice
&s;en&s;ibly &s;hocked at a blight &s;o unmerited to the hopes
<PB N="16" REF="16">
cheri&s;hed by Indiana and Clermont Lynmere: for
though the fruits of this change of plan would be
reaped by her little darling, they were robbed of all
their &s;weetne&s;s to a mind &s;o correct, by their un|de&s;erved
bitterne&s;s towards the fir&s;t expectants.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, however, was immoveable; he would
provide hand&s;omely, he &s;aid, for Indiana and Cler|mont,
by &s;ettling a thou&s;and pounds a-year between
them; and he would bequeath capital legacies
among&s;t the re&s;t of his nephews and nieces: but as
to the bulk of his fortune, it &s;hould all go to Camilla;
for how el&s;e could he make her amends for having
amu&s;ed him? or how, when he was gone, &s;hould
he prove to her he loved her the be&s;t?</P>
<P>Sir Hugh could keep nothing &s;ecret; Camilla was
&s;oon informed of the riches &s;he was de&s;tined to in|herit;
and the &s;ervants, who now with added re&s;pect
attended her, took frequent opportunities of im|pre&s;&s;ing
her with the expectation, by the favours they
begged from her in rever&s;ion.</P>
<P>The happy young heire&s;s heard them with little
concern: intere&s;t and ambition could find no room
in a mind, which to dance, &s;ing, and play, could en|liven
to rapture. Yet the continued repetition of
reque&s;ts &s;oon made the idea of patronage familiar to
her, and though wholly uninfected with one thought
of power or con&s;equence, &s;he &s;ometimes $egal$d her
fancy with the pre&s;ents &s;he &s;hould make among&s;t her
friends; de&s;igning a coach for her mamma, that &s;he
might oftener go abroad; an hor&s;e for her brother
Lionel, which &s;he knew to be his mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate
wi&s;h; a new bureau, with a lock and key, for her
elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter Lavinia; innumerable trinkets for her
cou&s;in Indiana; dolls and toys, without end, for her
little &s;i&s;ter Eugenia; and a new library of new
books, finely bound and gilt, for her papa. But
the&s;e munificent donations looked forward to no
other date than the anticipation of womanhood. If
an hint were &s;urmi&s;ed of her &s;urviving her uncle, an
impetuous &s;hower of tears dampt all her gay &s;chemes,
deluged every airy ca&s;tle, and &s;hewed the in&s;tinctive
<PB N="17" REF="17">
gratitude which kindne&s;s can awaken, even in the
unthinking period of earlie&s;t youth, in tho&s;e bo&s;oms it
has ever the power to animate.</P>
<P>Her en&s;uing birth-day, upon which &s;he would
enter her tenth year, wa$ to announce to the adjoin|ing
country her uncle's &s;plendid plan in her favour.
Her brother and &s;i&s;ters were invited to keep it with
her at Cleves; but Sir Hugh declined a&s;king either
her father or mother, that his own time, without re|&s;traint,
might be dedicated to the promotion of her
fe&s;tivity; he even reque&s;ted of Mi&s;s Margland, that
&s;he would not appear that day, le&s;t her pre&s;ence
&s;hould curb the children's &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The gay little party, con&s;i&s;ting of Lavinia, who
was two years older, and Eugenia, who was two
years younger than Camilla, with her beautiful
cou&s;in, who was exactly of her own age, her brother
Lionel, who counted three years more, and Edgar
Mandlebert, a ward of Mr. Tyrold's, all a&s;&s;embled
at Cleves upon this important occa&s;ion, at eight
o'clock in the morning, to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Edgar Mandlebert, an uncommonly &s;pirited and
manly boy, now thirteen years of age, was heir to
one of the fine&s;t e&s;tates in the country. He was the
only &s;on of a bo&s;om friend of Mr. Tyrold, to who&s;e
guardian&s;hip he had been con&s;igned almo&s;t from his
infancy, and who &s;uperintended the care of his edu|cation
with as much zeal, though not as much oeco|nomy,
as that of his own &s;on. He placed him
under the tuition of Dr. Marchmont, a man of con|&s;ummate
learning, and he &s;ent for him to Ethering|ton
twice in every year, where he a&s;&s;i$uou&s;ly kept up
his &s;tudies by his own per&s;onal in&s;tructions. &startq;I leave
him rich, my dear friend,&endq; &s;aid his father, when on
his death-bed he recommended him to Mr. Tyrold,
&startq;and you, I tru&s;t, will make him good, and &s;ee him
happy; and &s;hould hereafter a daughter of your own,
from frequent intercour&s;e, become mi&s;tre&s;s of his af|fections,
do not &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a union from a di&s;parity
of fortune, which a daughter of yours, and of your
incomparable partner's, can hardly fail to counter|balance
<PB N="18" REF="18">
in merit.&endq; Mr. Tyrold, though too noble
to avail him&s;elf of a declaration &s;o generous, by
forming any plan to bring &s;uch a connection to bear,
felt con&s;cientiou&s;ly ab&s;olved from u&s;ing any mea&s;ures
of fru&s;tration, and determined, as the young people
grew up, neither to promote nor impede any ri&s;ing
regard.</P>
<P>The e&s;tate of Beech Park was not all that young
Mandlebert inherited; the friend&s;hip of its late
owner for Mr. Tyrold, &s;eemed in&s;tinctively transfu&s;ed
into his brea&s;t, and he paid back the parental tender|ne&s;s
with which he was watched and cheri&s;hed, by a
fondne&s;s and veneration truly &s;ilial.</P>
<P>Whatever could indulge or delight the little &s;et
was brought forth upon this joyous meeting; fruits,
&s;weetmeats, and cakes; car$s, trinkets, and blind
fidlers, were all at the unlimited command of the
fairy mi&s;tre&s;s of the ceremonies. But unbounded
as were the tran&s;ports of the jovial little group, they
could &s;carcely keep pace with the enjoyment of Sir
Hugh; he entered into all their plays, he forgot all
his pains, he laughed becau&s;e they laughed, and
&s;uffered his darling little girl to govern and direct him
at her plea&s;ure. She made him whi&s;kers of cork,
powdered his brown bob, and covered a thread paper
with black ribbon to hang to it for a quene. She
metamorpho&s;ed him into a female, accoutering him
with her fine new cap, while &s;he enveloped her own
&s;mall head in his wig; and then, tying the maid's
apron round his wai&s;t, put a rattle into his hand, and
Eugenia's doll upon his lap, which &s;he told him was
a baby that he mu&s;t nur&s;e and amu&s;e.</P>
<P>The exce&s;s of merriment thus excited &s;pread
through the whole hou&s;e. Lionel called in the &s;er|vants
to &s;ee this comical &s;ight, and the &s;ervants in|dulged
their numerous gue&s;ts with a peep at it from
the windows. Sir Hugh, meanwhile, re&s;olved to
object to nothing, performed every part a&s;&s;igned him,
joined in their hearty laughs at the grote&s;que figure
they made of him, and cordially encouraged all their
proceedings, a&s;&s;uring them he had not been &s;o much
<PB N="19" REF="19">
diverted him&s;elf &s;ince his fall from his hor&s;e, and
advi&s;ing them, with great zeal, to be merry while
they could: &startq;For you will never, my dears,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;be younger, never while you live; no more,
for that matter, &s;hall I, neither, for all I am &s;o much
older, which, in that point, makes no difference.&endq;</P>
<P>He grew weary, however, fir&s;t; and &s;tretching
him&s;elf his full length, with a prodigious yawn,
&startq;Heigh ho!&endq; he cried, &startq;Camilla, my dear, do
take away poor Doll, for fear I &s;hould let it &s;lip.&endq;</P>
<P>The little gigglers, almo&s;t in convul&s;ions of
laughter, intreated him to nur&s;e it &s;ome time longer;
but he frankly an&s;wered, &startq;No, my dears, no; I
can play no more now, if I'd ever &s;o fain, for I'm
tired to death, which is really a pity; &s;o you mu&s;t
either go out with me my airing, for a re&s;t to your
merry little &s;ides, or &s;lay and play by your&s;elves till I
come back, which I think will put you all into
fevers; but, however, nobody &s;hall trouble your
little &s;ouls with advice to-day; there are days enough
in the year for teazing, without this one.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla in&s;tantly decided for the airing, and with|out
a di&s;&s;entient voice: &s;o entirely had the extreme
good humour of Sir Hugh won the hearts of the
little party, that they felt as if the whole of their
entertainment depended upon his pre&s;ence. The
carriage, therefore, was ordered for the baronet and
his four nieces, and Lionel and Edgar Mandlebert,
at the reque&s;t of Camilla, were gratified with hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Camilla was de&s;ired to fix their route, and while
&s;he he&s;itated from the variety in her choice, Lionel
propo&s;ed to Edgar that they &s;hould take a view of
his hou&s;e, park, and gardens, which were only three
miles from Cleves. Edgar referred the matter to
Indiana, to who&s;e already exqui&s;ite beauty his ju|venile
admiration paid its mo&s;t ea$ly obei&s;ance. In|diana
approved; the little heroine of the day a&s;|&s;ented
with plea&s;ure, and they immediately &s;et out
upon the happy expedition.</P>
<P>The two boys the whole way came with offerings
of wild honey&s;uckle and &s;weet briar, the grateful
<PB N="20" REF="20">
no&s;egays of all-diffu&s;ing nature, to the coach win|dows,
each carefully pre&s;enting the mo&s;t fragrant to
Indiana; for Lionel, even more than &s;ympathi&s;ing
with Edgar, declared his &s;i&s;ters to be mere frights in
compari&s;on with his fair cou&s;in. Their partiality,
however, &s;truggled vainly again&s;t that of Sir Hugh,
who &s;till, in every the mo&s;t trivial particular, gave
the preference to Camilla.</P>
<P>The baron$t had ordered that his own garden
chair &s;hould follow him to $ung Mandlebert's park,
that he might take Camilla by his &s;ide, and go about
the grounds without fatigue; the re&s;t were to walk.
Here Indiana received again the homage of her two
young be$us; they pointed out to her the mo&s;t
beautiful pro&s;pects, they gathered her the faire&s;t
flowers, they loaded her with the be$t and ripe&s;t fruits.</P>
<P>This was no &s;ooner ob&s;erved by Sir Hugh, than
ha&s;tily &s;topping his chair, he called after them aloud,
&startq;Holloa! come hither, my boys! here, you Mr.
young Mandlebert, what are you all about? Why
don't you bring that be&s;t bunch of grapes to Ca|milla?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have already promi&s;ed it to Mi&s;s Lynmere,
Sir.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O ho, have you &s;o? well, give it her then if
you have. I have no right to rob you of your choice.
Indiana, my dear, how do you like this place?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Very much, indeed, un$$$; I never &s;aw any
place I liked &s;o much in my life.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;ure el&s;e,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &startq;I &s;hould never
care for it again my &s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I could look at it for ever,&endq; cried Indiana,
&startq;and not be tired!&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh gravely pau&s;ed the&s;e &s;peeches, and re|ga$$ed
them in turn with much &s;teadine&s;s, as if &s;et|tling
their future de&s;tinies; but ever unable to keep
a &s;ingle thought to him&s;elf, he pre&s;ently bur&s;t forth
aloud with this new mental arrangement, &s;aying:
&startq;Well, my dears, well; this is not quite the thing
I had taken a fancy to in my own private brain, but
it's all for the be&s;t, there's no doubt; though the
<PB N="21" REF="21">
e&s;tate being ju&s;t in my neighbourhood, would have
made it more &s;uitable for Camilla; I mean provided
we could have bought, among us, the odd three miles
between the Parks; which how many acres they
make, I can't pretend to &s;ay, without the proper
calculation; but if it was all joined, it would be the
fine&s;t domain in the county, as far as I know to the
contrary: neverthele&s;s, my dear young Mr. Man|dlebert,
you hav$ a right to choo&s;e for your&s;elf; for
as to beauty, 'tis mere fancy; not but what Indiana
has one or other the prettie&s;t face I ever &s;aw, though
I think Camilla's &s;o much prettier; I mean in point
of winningne&s;s. However, there's no fear as to my
con&s;ent, for nothing can be a greater plea&s;ure to me
than having two &s;uch good girls, both being cou&s;ins,
live &s;o near that they may overlook one another from
park to park, all day long, by the mode of a
tele&s;cope.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, perfectly under&s;tanding him, blu&s;hed deep|ly,
and, forgetting what he had ju&s;t declared, offered
his grapes to Lavinia. Indiana, conceiving her&s;elf
already mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o fine a place, &s;miled with ap|proving
complacency; and the re&s;t were too much
occupied with the objects around them, to li&s;ten to
&s;o long a &s;peech.</P>
<P>They then all moved on; but, &s;oon after, Lionel,
flying up to his uncle's chair, informed Camilla he
had ju&s;t heard from the gardener, that only half a
mile off, at Northwick, there was a fair, to which he
begged &s;he would a&s;k to go. She found no difficul|ty
in obliging him; and Sir Hugh was incapable of
he&s;itating at whatever &s;he could de&s;ire. The carri|age
and the hor&s;es for the boys were again ordered,
and to the regret of only Edgar and Indiana, the
beautiful plantations of Beech Park were relinqui&s;h|ed
for the fair.</P>
<P>They had hardly proceeded twenty yards, when
the &s;miles that had brightened the face of Lavinia,
the elde&s;t daughter of Mr. Tyrold, were &s;uddenly
overca&s;t, giving place to a look of di&s;may, which
&s;eemed the effect of &s;ome abruptly painful recollecti|on;
<PB N="22" REF="22">
and the moment Sir Hugh perceived it, and en|quired
the cau&s;e, the tears rolled fa&s;t down her cheeks,
and &s;he &s;aid &s;he had been guilty of a great-&s;in, and
could never forgive her&s;elf.</P>
<P>They all eagerly endeavoured to con&s;ole her, Ca|milla
fondly taking her hand, little Eugenia &s;ympa|thetically
crying over and ki&s;&s;ing her, Indiana beg|ging
to know what was the matter, and Sir Hugh,
holding out to her the fine&s;t peach from his &s;tores for
Camilla, and &s;aying, &startq;Don't cry &s;o, my dear, don't
cry: take a little bit of peach; I dare &s;ay you are
not &s;o bad as you think for.&endq;</P>
<P>The weeping young penitent be&s;ought leave to get
out of the coach with Camilla, to whom alone &s;he
could explain her&s;elf. Camilla almo&s;t opened the
door her&s;elf to ha&s;ten the di&s;covery; and the mo|ment
they had run up a bank by the road &s;ide, &startq;Tell
me what it is, my dear Lavinia,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;and I
am &s;ure my uncle will do any thing in the world to
help you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O Camilla,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;I have di&s;obeyed
mamma! and I did not mean it in the lea&s;t&mdash;but I
have forgot all her commands!&mdash;She charged me not
to let Eugenia &s;tir out from Cleves, becau&s;e of the
&s;mall pox&mdash;and &s;he has been already at Beech Park&mdash;
and now, how can I tell the poor little thing &s;he mu&s;t
not go to the fair?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Don't vex your&s;elf about that,&endq; cried Camilla,
kindly ki&s;&s;ing the tears off her cheeks, &startq;for I will
&s;tay behind, and play with Eugenia my&s;elf, if my
uncle will drive us back to Beech Park; and then
all the re&s;t may go to the fair, and take us up again
in the way home.&endq;</P>
<P>With this expedient &s;he flew to the coach, charg|ing
the two boys, who with great curio&s;ity had rid|den
to the bank-&s;ide, and li&s;tened to all that had pa&s;&s;|ed,
to comfort Lavinia.</P>
<P>&startq;Lionel,&endq; cried Edgar, &startq;do you know, while Ca|milla
was &s;peaking &s;o kindly to Lavinia, I thought
&s;he looked almo&s;t as pretty as your cou&s;in?&endq; Lio|nel
<PB N="23" REF="23">
would by no means &s;ub&s;cribe to this opinion, but
Edgar would not retract.</P>
<P>Camilla, jumping into the carriage, threw her
arms around the neck of her uncle, and whi&s;pered
to him all that had pa&s;&s;ed. &startq;Poor innocent little
dear!&endq; cried $e, &startq;is that all? it's ju&s;t nothing, con|&s;idering
her young age.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, looking out of the window, &startq;Lavinia,&endq;
he &s;aid, &startq;you have done no more harm than what's
quite natural; and &s;o I &s;hall tell your mamma, who
is a woman of &s;en&s;e, and won't expect &s;uch a young
head as yours to be of the &s;ame age as hers and mine.
But come into the coach, my dear; we'll ju&s;t drive
as far as Northwick, for an airing, and then back
again.&endq;</P>
<P>The extreme delicacy of the con&s;titution of Eu|genia
had hitherto deterred Mrs. Tyrold from ino|culating
her; &s;he had therefore &s;crupulou&s;ly kept
her from all mi&s;$$llaneous intercour&s;e in the neigh|bourhood;
but as the weakne&s;s of her in&s;ancy was
now promi&s;ing to change into health and &s;trength,
&s;he meant to give to that terrible di&s;ea&s;e its be&s;t
chance, and the only &s;ecurity it allows from perpe|tual
alarm, immediately after the heats of the pre&s;ent
autumn &s;hould be over.</P>
<P>Lavinia, unu&s;ed to di&s;obedience, could not be hap|py
in practi&s;ing it: &s;he entreated, therefore, to re|turn
immediately to Cleves. Sir Hugh complied;
premi&s;ing only that they mu&s;t none of them expect
him to be of their play-party again till after dinner.</P>
<P>The coachman then received fre&s;h orders: but
the moment they were communicated to the two
boys, Lionel, prote&s;ting he would not lo&s;e the fair,
&s;aid he &s;hould &s;oon overtake them, and, regardle&s;s of
all remon&s;trances, put &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and gallop|ped
off.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, looking after him with great alarm,
exclaimed, &startq;Now he is going to break all his bones!
which is always the ca&s;e with tho&s;e young boys,
when fir&s;t they get a hor&s;eback.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="24">
Camilla, terrified that &s;he had begged this boon,
reque&s;ted that the &s;ervant might directly ride after
him.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, my dear, if you wi&s;h it,&endq; an&s;wered Sir
Hugh; only we have but this one man for us all,
becau&s;e of the re&s;t &s;taying to get the ball and &s;up|per
ready; &s;o that if we &s;hould be overturned our|&s;elves,
here's never a &s;oul to pick us up.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar offered to ride on alone, and per&s;uade the
truant to return.</P>
<P>&startq;Thank you, my dear, thank you,&endq; an&s;wered Sir
Hugh, &startq;you are as good a boy as any I know, but,
in point of hor&s;eman&s;hip, one's as ignorant as t'other,
as far as I can tell; &s;o we may only &s;ee both your
&s;culls fractured in&s;tead of one, in the mid&s;t of your
galloping; which, God forbid, for either.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Then let us all go together,&endq; cried Indiana,
&startq;and bring him back.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But do not let us get out of the coach, uncle,&endq;
&s;aid Lavinia; &startq;pray do not let us get out!&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh agreed; though he added, that as to
the &s;mall pox, he could by no means &s;ee it in the
&s;ame light, for he had no notion of people's taking
di&s;ea&s;es upon them&s;elves. &startq;Be&s;ides,&endq; continued he,
&startq;&s;he will be &s;ure to have it when her time comes,
whether &s;he is moped up or no; and how did people
do before the&s;e new modes of making them&s;elves &s;ick
of their own accord?&endq;</P>
<P>Pitying, however, the unea&s;ine&s;s of Lavinia, when
they came near the town, he called to the footman,
and &s;aid, &startq;Ha$k'ee, Jacob, do you ride on fir&s;t, and
keep a &s;harp look out that nobody has the &s;mall pox.&endq;</P>
<P>The fair being held in the &s;uburbs, they &s;oon ar|rived
at &s;ome &s;traggling booths, and the coach, at
the in&s;tance of Lavinia, was &s;topt.</P>
<P>Indiana now $word$ &s;olicited leave to alight and
&s;ee the fair; and $dgar offered to be her e&s;quire.
Sir Hugh con&s;ented, but de&s;ired that Lavinia and
Camilla might be al&s;o of the party. Lavinia tried
vainly to excu&s;e her&s;elf; he a&s;&s;ured her it would rai&s;e
her &s;pirits, and bid her be under no apprehen&s;ion,
<PB N="25" REF="25">
for he would &s;tay and amu&s;e the little Eugenia him|&s;elf,
and take care that &s;he came to no harm.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner gone, however, than the lit|tle
girl cried to follow; Sir Hugh, compa&s;&s;ionately
ki&s;&s;ing her, owned &s;he had as good a right as any of
them, and declared it was a hard thing to have her
puni&s;hed for other peoples particularities. This con|ce&s;&s;ion
&s;erved only to make her tears flow the fa&s;ter;
till, unable to bear the &s;ight, he &s;aid he could not an|&s;wer
to his con&s;cience the vexing &s;uch a young thing,
and, promi&s;ing &s;he &s;hould have whatever &s;he liked,
if &s;he would cry no more, he ordered the coachman
to drive to the fir&s;t booth where there were any toy&punc;
to be &s;old.</P>
<P>Here, having no footman to bring the trinkets to
the coach, he alighted, and, &s;uffering the little girl,
for whom he had not a fear him&s;elf, to accompany
him, he entered the booth, and told her to take
whatever hit her fancy, for &s;he &s;hould have as many
playthings as &s;he could carry.</P>
<P>Her grief now gave way to extacy, and her little
hands could &s;oon &s;carcely &s;u&s;tain the loaded &s;kirt of
her white frock. Sir Hugh, determining to make
the re&s;t of the children equally happy, was &s;electing
pre&s;ents for them all, when the little group, igno|rant
whom they &s;hould encounter, advanced towards
the &s;ame booth: but he had hardly time to exclaim,
&startq;Oho! have you caught us?&endq; when the innocent
voice of Eugenia, calling out, &startq;Little boy; what's
the matter with your face, little boy?&endq; drew his
attention another way, and he perceived a child ap|parently
ju&s;t recovering from the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>Edgar, who at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;aw the &s;ame
dreaded &s;ight, darted forward, &s;eized Eugenia in his
arms, and, in defiance of her playthings and her
&s;truggles, carried her back to the coach; while La|vinia,
in an agony of terror, ran up to the little boy,
and, crying out, &startq;O go away! go away!&endq; drag|ged
him out of the booth, and, perfectly uncon&s;cious
what &s;he did, covered his head with her frock, and
held him fa&s;t with both her hands.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="26">
Sir Hugh, all agha&s;t, hurried out of the booth,
but could &s;carce &s;upport him&s;elf from emotion; and,
while he leaned upon his &s;tick, ejaculating, &startq;Lord
help us! what poor creatures we are, we poor mor|tals!&endq;
Edgar had the pre&s;ence of mind to make In|diana
and Camilla go directly to the carriage. He
then prevailed with Sir Hugh to enter it al&s;o, and
ran back for Lavinia. But when he perceived the
&s;ituation into which di&s;tre&s;s and affright had driven
her, and &s;aw her &s;obbing over the child, whom &s;he
&s;till held confined, with an idea of hiding him from
Eugenia, he was in&s;tantly &s;en&s;ible of the danger of
her joining her little &s;i&s;ter. Extremely perplexed
for them all, and afraid, by going from the &s;ick
child, he might him&s;elf carry the infection to the
coach, he &s;ent a man to Sir Hugh to know what
was to be done.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, totally over&s;et by the unexpected ac|cident,
and con&s;cience-&s;truck at his own wilful &s;hare
in ri&s;king it, was utterly helple&s;s, and could only
an&s;wer, that he wi&s;hed young Mr. Edgar would give
him his advice.</P>
<P>Edgar, thus called upon, now fir&s;t felt the abi|lities
which his &s;hort life had not hitherto brought
into u&s;e: he begged Sir Hugh would return imme|diately
to Cleves, and keep Eugenia there for a few
days with Camilla and her cou&s;in; while he under|took
to go him&s;elf in &s;earch of Lionel, with who&s;e
a&s;&s;i&s;tance he would convey Lavinia back to Ether|$ngton,
without &s;eeing her little &s;i&s;ter; &s;ince &s;he
mu&s;t now be as full of contagion as the poor object
who had ju&s;t had the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, much relieved, &s;ent him word he had
no doubt he would become the fir&s;t &s;cholar of the
age; and de&s;ired he would get a chai&s;e for him&s;elf
and Lavinia, and let the footman take charge of his
hor&s;e.</P>
<P>He then ordered the coach to Cleves.</P>
<P>Edgar fulfilled the injunctions of Sir Hugh with
$lacrity; but had a very difficult ta&s;k to find Lionel,
and one far more painful to appea&s;e Lavinia, who&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="27">
apprehen&s;ions were &s;o great as they advanced towards
Etherington, that, to &s;ooth and comfort her, he or|dered
the po&s;tilion to drive $ir&s;t to a $arm-hou&s;e near
Cleves, whence he forwarded a boy to Sir Hugh,
with entreaties that he would write a few lines to
Mrs. Tyrold, in exculpation of her &s;or$owing
daughter.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh complied, but was &s;o little in the habit
of writing, that he &s;ent over a me&s;&s;enger to de&s;ire
they would dine at the farm hou&s;e, in order to give
him time to compo&s;e his epi&s;tic.</P>
<P>Early in the afternoon, he conveyed to them the
following letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mrs. Tyrold at the Par&s;onage Hou&s;e, belonging to
the Rever$nd Rector, Mr. Tyrold, for the Time
being, at Etherington, in Hamp&s;hire.</HEAD>
<OPENER>DEAR SISTER,</OPENER>
<P>I AM no remarkable good writer, in compari&s;on
with my brother, which you will excu&s;e from my
deficiencies, as it is my only apology. I beg you
will not be angry with little Lavinia, as &s;he did
nothing in the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, except wanting to do
right, only not mentioning it in the beginning, which
is very excu&s;able in the light of a fault; the wi&s;e&s;t
of us having been youths our&s;elves once, and the
mo&s;t learned being &s;ubject to do wrong, but how
much &s;o the ignorant? of which I may &s;peak more
properly. However, as &s;he would certainly have
caught the &s;mall pox her&s;elf, except from the lucky
circum&s;tance of having had it before, I think it be&s;t
to keep Eugenia a few days at Cleves, for the &s;ake
of her infection. Not but what if &s;he &s;hould have
it, I tru&s;t your &s;en&s;e won't fret about it, as it is only
in the cour&s;e of Nature: which, if &s;he had been in|oculated,
is more than any man could &s;ay; even a
phy&s;ician. So the whole being my own fault, with|out
the lea&s;t meaning to offend, if any thing comes
of it, I hope, my dear &s;i&s;ter, you won't take it ill,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
e&s;pecially of poor little Lavinia, for 'tis hard if &s;uch
young things may not be happy at their time of life,
before having done harm to a human &s;oul. Poor
dears! 'tis &s;oon enough to be unhappy after being
wicked; which, God knows, we are all liable to be
in the proper &s;ea&s;on. I beg my love to my bro|ther;
and remain,</P>
<CLOSER>Dear &s;i&s;ter,
Your affectionate brother,
<SIGNED>HUGH TYROLD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> It is but ju&s;tice to my brother to mention
that young Ma&s;ter Mandlebert's behaviour has done
the greate&s;t honour to the cla&s;&s;ics; which mu&s;t be a
great &s;atisfaction to a per&s;on having the care of his
education.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the day lo&s;t all its delights to the
young heire&s;s from this unfortunate adventure. The
deprivation of three of the party, with the well|grounded
fear of Mrs. Tyrold's ju&s;t blame, were
greater mortifications to tho&s;e that remained, than
even the ball and &s;upper could remove. And Sir
Hugh, to whom their lowered &s;pirits were &s;uf|ficiently
depre&s;&s;ing, had an additional, though hardly
to him&s;elf acknowledged, weight upon his mind, re|lative
to Eugenia and the &s;mall pox.</P>
<P>The contrition of the trembling Lavinia could not
but obtain from Mrs. Tyrold the pardon it de&s;erved:
but &s;he could make no allowance for the extreme
want of con&s;ideration in Sir Hugh; and anxiou&s;ly
waited the time when &s;he might call back Eugenia
from the management of a per&s;on whom &s;he con|&s;idered
as more childi&s;h than her children them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Con&s;equences.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY precaution being taken with regard to
Lavinia and her clothes, for warding off infection to
<PB N="29" REF="29">
Eugenia, if as yet &s;he had e&s;caped it; Mrs. Tyrold
fixed a day for fetching her little daughter from
Cleves. Sir Hugh, at the earne&s;t intreaty of Ca|milla,
invited the young party to come again early
that morning, that &s;ome amends might be made them
for their recent di&s;appointment of the ball and &s;up|per,
by a holiday, and a little &s;port, previous to the
arrival of Mrs. Tyrold; to whom he voluntarily
pledged his word, that Eugenia &s;hould not again be
taken abroad, nor &s;uffered to appear before any
&s;trangers.</P>
<P>Various gambols were now again enacted by the
once more happy group; but all was conducted with
as much &s;ecurity as gaiety, till Lionel propo&s;ed the
amu&s;ement of riding upon a plank in the park.</P>
<P>A plank was immediately procured by the gar|dener,
and placed upon the trunk of an old oak,
where it parted into two thick branches.</P>
<P>The boys and the three elde&s;t girls balanced one
another in turn, with great delight and dexterity;
but Sir Hugh feared committing the little Eugenia,
for whom he was grown very anxious, among&s;t them,
till the repinings of the child demoli&s;hed his pru|dence.
The difficulty how to indulge her with
&s;afety was, neverthele&s;s, con&s;iderable: and, after va|rious
experiments, he re&s;olved to tru&s;t her to nobody
but him&s;elf; and, placing her upon his lap, occu|pied
one end of the plank, and de&s;ired that as many
of the re&s;t as were nece&s;&s;ary to make the weight
equal, would &s;eat them&s;elves upon the other.</P>
<P>This diver&s;ion was &s;hort, but its con&s;equences
were long. Edgar Mandlebert, who &s;uperintended
the balance, poi&s;ed it with great exactne&s;s; yet no
&s;ooner was Sir Hugh elevated, than, becoming exceedingly
giddy, he involuntarily loo&s;ened his hold
of Eugenia, who fell from his arms to the ground.</P>
<P>In the agitation of his fright, he &s;tooped forward
to &s;ave her, but lo&s;t his equilibrium; and, in&s;tead of
re&s;cuing, followed her.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t confu&s;ion en&s;ued; Edgar, with ad|mirable
adroitne&s;s, pre&s;erved the elder girls from &s;uf|fering
<PB N="30" REF="30">
by the accident; and Lionel took care of
him&s;elf by leaping in&s;tantly from the plank: Sir
Hugh, extremely brui&s;ed, could not get up with|out
pain; but all concern and attention &s;oon centred
in the little Eugenia, who&s;e ince&s;&s;ant cries rai&s;ed ap|prehen&s;ions
of &s;ome more than common mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>She was carried to the hou&s;e in the arms of Edgar,
and delivered to the governe&s;s. She &s;creamed the
whole time &s;he was undre&s;&s;ing; and Edgar, con|vinced
&s;he had received &s;ome injury, gallopped off,
unbid, for a &s;urg$on: but what was the horror of
Sir Hugh, upon hearing him pronounce, that her
left &s;houlder was put out, and that one of her knees
was di&s;located!</P>
<P>In an agony of remor&s;e, he &s;hut him&s;elf up in
his room, without power to i&s;&s;ue a command, or
li&s;ten to a que&s;tion: nor could he be prevailed upon
to open his door, till the arrival of Mrs. Tyrold.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily then ru&s;hing out, he hurried to meet her;
and, &s;natching both her hands, and pre&s;&s;ing them
between his own, he bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ionate flood of
tears, and &s;obbed out: &startq;Hate me, my dear &s;i&s;ter,
for you can't help it! for I am &s;orry to tell it you,
but I believe I have been the death of poor Euge|nia,
that never hurt a fly in her life!&endq;</P>
<P>Pale, and &s;truck with dread, yet always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
her pre&s;ence of mind, Mrs. Tyrold di&s;engaged her|&s;elf,
and demanded where &s;he might find her? Sir
Hugh could make no rational an&s;wer; but Edgar,
who had run down &s;tairs, purpo&s;ing to communicate
the tidings more gently, briefly &s;tated the misfor|tune,
and conducted her to the poor little &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold, though nearly overpowered by a
&s;ight &s;o affecting, &s;till pre&s;erved her faculties for bet|ter
u&s;es than lamentation. She held the child in her
arms while the nece&s;&s;ary operations were performing
by the $urgeon; &s;he put her to bed, and watched by
her &s;ide the whole night; during which, in de&s;ianc$
of all precautions, a high fever came on, and &s;he
grew wor&s;e every moment.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="31">
The next morning, while &s;till in this alarming
&s;tate, the unfortunate little innocent exhibited un|doubted
&s;ymptoms of the &s;mall pox.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf at Cleves,
to &s;hare the parental ta&s;k of nur&s;ing the afflicted
child, who&s;e room he never left, except to give con|&s;olation
to his unhappy brother, who lived wholly in
his own apartment, refu&s;ing the &s;ight even of Ca|milla,
and calling him&s;elf a mon&s;ter too wicked to
look at any thing that was good; though the affec|tionate
little girl, pining at the exclu&s;ion, continu|ally
pre&s;ented her&s;elf at his door.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e bore every p$oguo&s;ti$ of fatal con&s;e|quences,
and the fond parents &s;oon lo&s;t all hope,
though they redoubled every attention.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then gave him&s;elf up wholly to de&s;pair:
he darkened his room, refu&s;ed all food but bread and
water, permitted no one to approach him, and re|viled
him&s;elf invariably with the contrition of a wil|ful
murderer.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of &s;elf-puni&s;hment he per&s;evered, till
the di&s;temper unexpectedly took a &s;udden and happy
turn, and the &s;urgeon made known, that his patient
might po&s;&s;ibly recover.</P>
<P>The joy of Sir Hugh was now as &s;rantic as his
grief had been the moment before: he ha&s;tened to
his drawing-room, commanded that the whole hou&s;e
&s;hould be illuminated; promi&s;ed a year's wages to all
his &s;ervants; bid his hou&s;e-keeper di&s;tribute beef
and broth throughout the village; and &s;ent direc|tions
that the bells of the three neare&s;t pari&s;h
churches &s;hould be rang for a day and a night. But
when Mr. Tyrold, to avert the horror of any wholly
$$prepared di&s;appointment, repre&s;ented the &s;till pre|carious
&s;tate of Eugenia, and the many changes yet
to be feared; he de&s;perately rever&s;ed all his orders,
returned &s;adly to his dark room, and prote&s;ted he
would never more rejoice, till Mrs. Tyrold her&s;elf
&s;hould come to him with good news.</P>
<P>This anxiou&s;ly waited aera at length arrived; Eu|genia,
though &s;eamed and even &s;carred by the hor|rible
<PB N="32" REF="32">
di&s;order, was declared out of danger; and
Mrs. Tyrold, burying her angui&s;h at the alteration,
in her joy for the &s;afety of her child, with an heart
overflowing from pious gratitude, became the me&s;&s;en|ger
of peace; and, holding out her hand to Sir
Hugh, a&s;&s;ured him the little Eugenia would &s;oon be
well.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, in an ec&s;ta&s;y which no power could
check, forgot every pain and infirmity to hurry up
to the apartment of the little girl, that he might
kneel, he &s;aid, at her feet, and there give thanks
for her recovery: but the moment he entered the
room, and &s;aw the dreadful havoc grim di&s;ea&s;e had
made on her face; not a trace of her beauty left,
no re&s;emblance by which he could have known her;
he &s;hrunk back, wrung his hands, called him&s;elf the
mo&s;t &s;inful of all created beings, and in the deepe&s;t
de&s;pondence, &s;unk into a chair and wept aloud.</P>
<P>Eugenia &s;oon began to cry al&s;o, though uncon|&s;cious
for what cau&s;e; and Mrs. Tyrold remon|&s;trated
to Sir Hugh upon the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch
tran&s;ports, calmly be&s;eeching him to retire and com|po&s;e
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, &s;i&s;ter,&endq; he an&s;wered, &startq;yes, I'll go away,
for I am &s;ure, I do not want to look at her again;
but to think of its being all my doing!&mdash;O bro|ther!
O &s;i&s;ter! why don't you both kill me in re|turn?
And what amends can I make her? what
amends, except a poor little trifle of money?&mdash;And
as to that, &s;he &s;hall have it, God knows, every penny
I am worth, the moment I am gone; ay, that &s;he
&s;hall, to a &s;ingle &s;hilling, if I die to-morrow!&endq;</P>
<P>Starting up with revived courage from this idea,
he ventured again to turn his head towards Eugenia,
exclaiming: &startq;O, if &s;he does but get well! does
but ea&s;e my poor con&s;cience by making me out not
to be a murderer, a guinea for every pit in that poor
face will I &s;ettle on her out of hand; yes, before I
&s;o much as breathe again, for fear of dying in the
me$n time!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="33">
Mrs. Tyrold &s;carce noticed this declaration; but
his brother endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from &s;o &s;ud|den
and partial a mea&s;ure: he would not, however,
li&s;ten; he made what &s;peed he could down &s;tairs,
called ha&s;tily for his hat and &s;tick, commanded all
his &s;ervants to attend him, and muttering frequent
ejaculations to him&s;elf, that he would not tru&s;t to
changing his mind, he proceeded to the family cha|pel,
and approaching with eager &s;teps to the altar,
knelt down, and bidding every one hear and wit|ne&s;s
what he &s;aid, made a &s;olemn vow, &startq;That it
he might be cleared of the crime of murder, by the
recovery of Eugenia, he would atone what he could
for the ill he had done her, by bequeathing to her
every thing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the world, in e&s;tate, ca&s;h,
and property, without the deduction of a &s;ixpence.&endq;</P>
<P>He told all pre&s;ent to remember and witne&s;s this,
in ca&s;e of an apoplexy before his new will could be
written down.</P>
<P>Returning then to the hou&s;e, lightened, he &s;aid,
from a load of &s;elf reproach, which had rendered
the la&s;t fortnight in&s;upportable to him, he &s;ent for
the attorney of a neighbouring town, and went up
&s;tairs, with a firmer mind, to wait his arrival in the
&s;ick room.</P>
<P>&startq;O, my dear uncle,&endq; cried his long bani&s;hed Ca|milla,
who hearing him upon the &s;tairs, &s;kipt lightly
after him, &startq;how glad I am to &s;ee you again! I
almo&s;t thought I &s;hould &s;ee you no more!&endq;</P>
<P>Here ended at once the ju&s;t acquired tranquillity
of Sir Hugh; all his &s;atisfaction for&s;ook him at the
appearance of his little darling; he con&s;idered her
as an innocent creature whom he was preparing to
injure; he could not bear to look at her; his heart
&s;mote him in her favour; his eyes filled with tears;
he was unable to go on, and with &s;low and trem|bling
&s;teps, he moved again towards his own room.</P>
<P>&startq;My deare&s;t uncle!&endq; cried Camilla, holding by
his coat, and hanging upon his arm, &startq;won't you
&s;peak to me?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="34">
&startq;Yes, my dear, to be &s;ure I will,&endq; he an&s;wered,
endeavouring to hide his emotion, &startq;only not now;
&s;o don't follow me Camilla, for I'm going to be re|markably
bu&s;y!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, uncle!&endq; &s;he cried, plaintively, &startq;and I have
not &s;een you &s;o long! And I have wi&s;hed &s;o to &s;ee
you! and I have been &s;o unhappy about Eugenia!
and you have always locked your door; and I would
not rap hard at it, for fear you &s;hould be a&s;leep:
But why would you not &s;ee me, uncle$ and why
will you &s;end me away?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Camilla,&endq; he replied, with increa&s;ed
agitation, &startq;I have u&s;ed you very ill; I have been
your wor&s;t enemy, which is the very rea&s;on I don't
care to &s;ee you; &s;o go away, I beg, for I am bad
enough without all this. But I give you my thanks
for all your $word$ playful gambols, having nothing
better now to $word$ you; which is but a poor return
from an uncle $word$ a niece!&endq;</P>
<P>He then $word$ him&s;elf into his room, leaving Ca|milla
drowned in tears at the out&s;ide of the door.</P>
<P>Wretch$d in reflecting upon the &s;hock and di&s;|appointment
which the new di&s;po&s;ition of his affairs
mu&s;t occa&s;ion her, he had not fortitude to inform
her of his intention. He de&s;ired to &s;peak with
Edgar Mandlebert, who, with all the Tyrold fa|mily,
re&s;ided, for the pre&s;ent, at Cleves, and ab|ruptly
related to him the new de&s;tination he had
ju&s;t vowed of his wealth; be&s;eeching that he would
break it in the &s;ofte&s;t manner to his poor little fa|vourite,
a&s;&s;uring her &s;he would be always the fir&s;t in
his love, though a point of mere con&s;cience had
forced him to make choice of another heire&s;s.</P>
<P>Edgar, who&s;e zeal to &s;erve and oblige had never
been put to &s;o &s;evere a te&s;t, he&s;itated how to obey
this injunction; yet he would not refu&s;e it, as he
found that all the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e were enabled,
if they plea&s;ed, to anticipate more incautiou&s;ly the
ill news. He followed her, therefore, into the gar|den,
whither &s;he had wandered to weep unob&s;erved;
but he$ &s;topt &s;hort at &s;ight of her di&s;tre&s;s, con|ceiving
<PB N="35" REF="35">
his errand to be already known to her, and
determined to con&s;ult with Indiana, to whom he
communicated his terrible emba&s;&s;y, intreating her to
devi&s;e &s;ome con&s;olation for her poor cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Indiana felt too much chagrined at her own part
in this tran&s;action, to give her attention to Camilla;
&s;he murmurred without &s;cruple at the deprivation of
what &s;he had once expected for her&s;elf, and at an|other
time for her brother; and expre&s;&s;ed much re|&s;entment
at the behaviour of her uncle, mingled
with &s;omething very near repining, not merely at
his late preference of Camilla, but even at the reco|very
of the little Eugenia. Edgar heard her with
&s;urpri&s;e, and wondered to find how much le&s;s her
beauty attracted him from the failure of her good
nature.</P>
<P>He now pur&s;ued the weeping Camilla, who, di&s;|per&s;ing
her tears at his approach, pretended to be
picking &s;ome lavender, and keeping her eyes &s;ted|fa&s;tly
upon the bu&s;h, a&s;ked him if he would have
any? He took a &s;prig, but &s;poke to her in a voice
of &s;uch involuntary compa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he &s;oon lo&s;t
her &s;elf-command, and the big drops again rolled
fa&s;t down her cheeks. Extremely concerned, he
&s;trove gently to &s;ooth her; but the expre&s;&s;ions of
regret at her uncle's avoidance, which then e&s;caped
her, &s;oon convinced him his own ta&s;k was &s;till to be
performed. With anxious fear of the con&s;equences
of a blow &s;o unlooked for, he executed it with all
the &s;peed, yet all the con&s;ideration in his power$
Camilla, the moment &s;he under&s;tood him, pa&s;&s;ion|ately
cla&s;ped her hands, and exclaimed: &startq;O if that
is all! If my uncle indeed loves me as well as before
all this; I am &s;ure I can never, never be &s;o wicked,
as to envy poor little Eugenia, who has &s;uffered &s;o
much, and almo&s;t been dying, becau&s;e &s;he will be
richer than I &s;hall be!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, delighted and relieved, thought &s;he was
grown a thou&s;and times more beautiful than In|diana;
and eagerly taking her hand, ran with her
to the apartment of the poor di&s;con&s;olate Sir Hugh;
<PB N="36" REF="36">
where his own eyes &s;oon overflowed from tenderne&s;s
and admiration, at the uncommon &s;cene he witne&s;&s;|ed,
of the generous affection with which Camilla
con&s;oled the fond di&s;tre&s;s of her uncle, though
&s;pringing from her own di&s;appointment and lo&s;s.</P>
<P>They &s;taid till the arrival of the attorney, who
took the directions of Sir Hugh, and drew up, for
his immediate &s;atisfaction, a &s;hort deed, making over,
according to his vow, all he &s;hould die po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of&punc;
without any let or qualification what&s;oever, to his
niece Eugenia. This was properly &s;igned and
&s;ealed, and Sir Hugh ha&s;tened up &s;tairs with a copy
of it to Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>All remon&s;trance was ineffectual; his con&s;cience,
he prote&s;ted, could no other way be appea&s;ed; his
noble little Camilla had forgiven him her ill u&s;age,
and he could now bear to look at the change for the
wor&s;e in Eugenia, without finding his heart-&s;trings
ready to $word$ at the &s;ight. &startq;You,&endq; he cried,
&startq;brother, who do not know what it is I have &s;uf|fered
through my con&s;cience, can't tell what it is to
get a little ea&s;e; for if &s;he had died, you might all
have had the comfort to &s;ay 'twas I murdered her,
which would have given you the &s;atisfaction of hav|ing
had no hand in it. But then, what would have
become of poor me, having it all upon my own
head? However, now, thank Heaven, I have no
need to care about the matter; for as to the mere
lo&s;s of beauty, pretty as it is to look at, I hope it
is no &s;uch great injury, as &s;he'll have a &s;plendid for|tune,
which is certainly a better thing, in point of
la&s;ting. For as to beauty, Lord help us! what is
it? except ju&s;t to the eye.&endq;</P>
<P>He then walked up to the child, intending to ki&s;s
her, but &s;topt and &s;ighed involuntarily as he looked
at her, &s;aying: &startq;After all, &s;he's not like the &s;ame
thing! no more than I am my&s;elf. I &s;hall never
think I know her again, never as long as I live! I
can't &s;o much as believe her to be the &s;ame, though
I am &s;ure of its being true. However, it &s;hall make
no change in my love for her, poor little dear, for
<PB N="37" REF="37">
$t's all my own doing: though innocently enough,
as to any meaning, God knows!&endq;</P>
<P>It was &s;till &s;ome time before the little girl reco|vered,
and then a new misfortune became daily more
palpable, &s;rom &s;ome latent and incurable mi&s;chief,
owing to her fall, which made her grow up with
one leg &s;horter than the other, and her whole figure
diminutive and deformed. The&s;e additional evils re|counciled
her parents to the partial will of her uncle,
which they now, indeed, thought le&s;s wanting in
equity, &s;ince no other reparation could be offered to
the innocent &s;ufferer for ills &s;o $$$$$mountable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>

<P>WHEN the tumult of this affair &s;ub&s;ided, Mr.
Tyrold and his family prepared to re-e&s;tabli&s;h them|&s;elves
at Etherington; and Mrs. Tyrold, the great
inducement for the &s;eparation being over, was earne&s;t
to take home again the di&s;inherited Camilla. Sir
Hugh, who&s;e plea&s;ure in her &s;ight was now embit|tered
by regret and remor&s;e, had not courage to
make the &s;malle&s;t oppo&s;ition; yet he &s;pent the day
of her departure in groans and penitence. He
thought it right, however, to detain Eugenia, who,
as his decided heire&s;s, was left to be brought up at
Cleves.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the amu&s;ing &s;ociety of his favourite;
the di&s;appointment he had inflicted upon her, and
the &s;weetne&s;s with which &s;he had borne it, preyed in|ce&s;&s;antly
upon his &s;pirits; and he knew not how to
employ him&s;elf, which way to direct his thoughts,
nor in what manner to beguile one moment of his
time, after the children were gone to re&s;t.</P>
<P>The view of the con&s;tant re&s;ources which his bro|ther
found in literature, augmented his melancholy
<PB N="38" REF="38">
at his own imperfections; and the &s;teady indu&s;try
with which Mr. Tyrold, in early youth, had at|tained
them, and which, while devoted to field &s;ports,
he had often ob&s;erved with wonder and pity, he
now looked back to with &s;elf-reproach, and recog|ni&s;ed
in its effect with a reverence almo&s;t awful.</P>
<P>His imagination, neither regulated by wi&s;dom,
nor di&s;ciplined by experience, having once taken
this turn, he &s;oon fancied that every earthly misfor|tune
originated in a carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of learning, and that
all he wi&s;hed, and all he wanted, upbraided him
with his ignorance. If di&s;ea&s;e and pain afflicted
him, he lamented the juvenile inattention that had
robbed him of acquirements which might have
taught him not to regard them; if the word <HI>&s;cholar</HI>
was named in his pre&s;ence, he $eaved the deepe&s;t
&s;igh; if an article in a new&s;paper, with which he
was unacquainted, was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, he reviled his early
heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;tudy; and the mention of a com|mon
pamphlet, which was unknown to him, gave
him a &s;en&s;ation of di&s;grace: even inevitable cala|mities
he attributed to the negligence of his educa|tion,
and con&s;trued every error, and every evil of
his life, to his youthful di&s;re&s;pect of Greek and
Latin.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of his mind, when his ordi|nary
maladies had the &s;erious aggravation of a vio|lent
fit of the gout.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the acute angui&s;h, and u&s;ele&s;s re|pentance,
which now alternately ravaged his hap|pine&s;s,
it &s;uddenly occurred to him, that, perhaps,
with proper in&s;truction, he might even yet obtain a
&s;ufficient portion of this enviable knowledge, to en|able
him to pa&s;s his evenings with &s;ome &s;imilarity to
his brother.</P>
<P>Revived by this &s;ugge&s;tion, he &s;ent for Mr. Ty|rold,
to communicate to him his idea, and to beg
he would put him into a way to recover his lo&s;t
time, by recommending to him a tutor, with whom
he might &s;et about a cour&s;e of &s;tudies:&mdash;&startq;Not that
I want,&endq; cried he, &startq;to make any particular great
<PB N="39" REF="39">
$igure as a &s;cholar; but if I could only learn ju&s;t
enough to amu&s;e me at odd hours, and make me for|get
the gout, it's as much as I de&s;ire.&endq;</P>
<P>The total impo&s;&s;ibility that &s;uch a project &s;hould
an&s;wer its given purpo&s;e, deterred not Mr. Tyrold
from li&s;tening to his reque&s;t. The mild philo&s;ophy
of his character &s;aw whatever was lenient to human
&s;ufferings as eligible, and looked no further for any
ob&s;tacles to the wi&s;jhes of an another, than to in|ve&s;tigate
if their gratification would be compatible
with innocence. He wrote, therefore, to a college
a&s;&s;ociate of his younger years, whom he knew to be
&s;everely embarra&s;&s;ed in his affairs, and made pro|po&s;als
for &s;ettling him in the hou&s;e of his brother.
The&s;e were not merely gratefully accepted by his old
friend, but drew forth a confe&s;&s;ion that he was daily
menaced with a public arre&s;t for debts, which he had
incurred without luxury or extravagance, from mere
ignorance of the value of money, and of oeconomy.</P>
<P>In the award of cool rea&s;on, to attend to what is
impracticable, appears a folly which no inducement
can excu&s;e. Mrs. Tyrold treated this &s;cheme with
calm, but complete contempt. She allowed no
palliation for a mea&s;ure of which the abortive end
was glaring; to hearken to it di&s;plea&s;ed her, as a
fal&s;e indulgence of childi&s;h vanity; and her under|&s;tanding
felt &s;hocked that Mr. Tyrold would deign
$o humour his brother in an enterpri&s;e which mu&s;t
In$vitably terminate in a fruitle&s;s con&s;umption of
time.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh &s;oon, but without anger, &s;aw her di&s;|approbation
of his plan; her opinions, from a high
&s;uperiority to all deceit, were as unre&s;erved as tho&s;e
of the baronet, from a nature incapable of caution.
He told her he was &s;orry to perceive that &s;he thought
he &s;hould make no proficiency, but intreated her to
take notice there was at lea&s;t no great pre&s;umption in
his attempt, as he meant to begin with the very be|ginning,
and to go no farther at the fir&s;t than any
young little &s;chool-boy; for he &s;hould give him&s;elf
fair play, by trying his hand with the rudiments,
<PB N="40" REF="40">
which would no &s;ooner be run over, than the re&s;t
would become plain failing: &startq;And if once,&endq; he
added. &startq;I &s;hould conquer the ma&s;tery of the cla&s;&s;ics,
I &s;hall make but very &s;hort work of all the re&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold &s;aw, as forcibly as his wife, the utter
impo&s;&s;ibility that Sir Hugh could now repair the
omi&s;&s;ions of his youth; but he was willing to con&s;ole
his want of knowledge, and &s;ooth his mortifications;
and while he grieved for his bodily infirmities, and
pitied his mental repinings, he con&s;idered his idea as
not illaudable, though in$udicious, and in favour of
its blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s, forgave its ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>He was gratified, al&s;o, in offering an honourable
provi&s;ion to a man of learning in di&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e
time and attention could not fail to de&s;erve it, if de|dicated
to his brother, in whatever way they might
be be&s;towed.</P>
<P>He took care to be at Cleves on the day Dr. Ork|borne,
this gentleman, was expected, and he pre|&s;ented
him to Sir Hugh with every mark of regard,
as a companion in who&s;e conver&s;ation, he &s;lattered
him&s;elf, pain might be lightened, and &s;eclu&s;ion from
mixt company cheerfully &s;upported.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude for the kind|ne&s;s
of Mr. Tyrold, and promi&s;ed to make it his fir&s;t
&s;tudy to merit the high con&s;ideration with which he
had been called from his retirement.</P>
<P>A &s;chola&s;tic education was all that had been given
to Dr. Orkborne by his friends; and though in that
their hopes were an&s;wered, no pro&s;perity followed.
His labours had been &s;econded by indu&s;try, but not
enforced by talents; and they &s;oon found how wide
the difference between acquiring &s;tores, and bringing
them into u&s;e. Application, operating upon a re|tentive
memory, had enabled him to lay by the mo&s;t
ample hoards of erudition; but the&s;e, though they
rendered him re&s;pectable among&s;t the learned, proved
nearly nugatory in his progre&s;s through the world,
from a total want of &s;kill and penetration to know
how or where they might turn to any account. Ne|verthele&s;s,
his character was unexceptionable, his
<PB N="41" REF="41">
manners were quiet, and his fortune was ruined.
The&s;e were the motives which induced rather the
benevolence than the &s;election of Mr. Tyrold to
name him to his brother, in the hope that, while
an a&s;ylum at Cl$v$s would exonerate him from all
pecuniary hard&s;hips, his very deficiency in brilliancy
of parts, and knowledge of mankind, which, though
differently modified, was equal to that of Sir Hugh
him&s;elf, would obviate regret of more cultivated &s;o|ciety,
and facilitate their reciprocal &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The introduction over, Mr. Tyrold &s;ought by ge|neral
topics to forward their acquaintance, before
any allu&s;ion &s;hould be made to the profe&s;&s;ed plan of
Sir Hugh; but Sir Hugh was too well plea&s;ed with
its ingenuity to be a&s;hamed of its avowal; he began,
therefore, immediately to de&s;cant upon the indolence
of his early years, and to impeach the want of timely
&s;everity in his in&s;tructors: &startq;For there is an old
&s;aying,&endq; he cried, &startq;but remarkably true, That
learning is better than hou&s;e or land; which I am
an in&s;tance of my&s;elf, for I have hou&s;e and land
plenty, yet don't know what to do with them pro|perly,
nor with my&s;elf neither, for want of a little
notion of things to guide me by.&endq; His brother, he
added, had been too partial in thinking him already
&s;itted for &s;uch a ma&s;ter as Dr. Orkborne; though
he promi&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding his time of life, to be|come
the mo&s;t docile of pupils, and he hoped before
long to do no di&s;credit to the Doctor as his tutor.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, who&s;e own benign $cuntenance could
&s;carce refrain from a &s;mile at this unqualified opening,
endeavoured to divert to &s;ome other &s;ubject the
grave a&s;$oni&s;hment of Dr. Orkborne, who, previ|ou&s;ly
aware of the age and ill health of the baronet,
naturally concluded him&s;elf called upon to &s;olace the
privacy of his life by reading or di&s;cour&s;e, but &s;ug|ge&s;ted
not the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;urmi&s;e he could be &s;um|moned
as a preceptor.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, however, far from palliating any de&s;ign,
di&s;gui&s;ed not even a feeling; he plunged deeper and
deeper in the acknowledgment of his ignorance, and
<PB N="42" REF="42">
&s;oon &s;et wholly apart the delicate circum&s;pection of
his brother, by demanding of Dr. Orkborne what
book he thought he had be&s;t buy for a beginning?</P>
<P>Receiving from the wondering Doctor no an&s;wer,
he good humouredly added, &startq;Come, don't be
a&s;hamed to name the ea&s;ie&s;t, for this rea&s;on; you
mu&s;t know my plan is one of my own, which it is
right to tell you. As fa&s;t as I get on, I intend, for
the &s;ake of remembering my le&s;&s;on, to &s;end for one
of my nephews, and teach it all over again to him
my&s;elf; which will be doing &s;ervice to us all at
once.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now, though for a &s;ew moments he
looked down, thought it be&s;t to leave the matter to
its own cour&s;e, and Dr. Orkborne to his own ob|&s;ervations;
fully per&s;uaded, that the &s;miles Sir Hugh
might excite would be tran&s;ient, and that no &s;erious
or la&s;ting ridicule could be attached to his character,
in the mind of a worthy man, to whom time and
opportunity would be allowed for an acquaintance
with its habitual beneficence. He excu&s;ed him&s;elf,
therefore, from &s;taying any longer, &s;omewhat to the
di&s;tre&s;s of Dr. Orkborne, but hardly with the notice
of the baronet, who&s;e eagerne&s;s in his new pur&s;uit
completely engro&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>His late adventure, and his new h$ire&s;s, now tor|mented
him no more; Indiana was forgotten, Ca|milla
but little thought of, and his whole mind be|came
exclu&s;ively occupied by this fruitful expedient
for retrieving his lo&s;t time.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, who&s;e life had been &s;pent in any
&s;tudy rather than that of human nature, was &s;o little
able to enter into the character of Sir Hugh, that
nothing le&s;s than the re&s;pect he knew to be due to
Mr. Tyrold, could have &s;aved him, upon his fir&s;t re|ception,
from a &s;u&s;picion that he had been &s;ummoned
in mere mockery. The &s;ituation, however, was pe|culiarly
de&s;irable to him, and the experiment, in the
beginning, co$re&s;ponded with the hopes of Mr. Ty|rold.
Placed &s;uddenly in ea&s;e and affluence, Dr.
Orkborne, with the mo&s;t profound de&s;ire to plea&s;e,
<PB N="43" REF="43">
&s;ought to &s;u&s;tain &s;o convenient a po&s;t, by obliging
the patron, whom he &s;oon &s;aw it would be vain to
attempt improving; while Sir Hugh, in return, pro|fe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf the mo&s;t fortunate of men, that he
had now met with a &s;cholar who had the good nature
not to de&s;pi&s;e him.</P>
<P>Relief from care thus combining with opportunity,
Dr. Orkborne was &s;carce &s;ettled, ere he determined
upon the execution of a long, critical, and difficult
work in philology, which he had often had in con|templation,
but never found lei&s;ure to undertake. By
this means he had a con&s;tant re&s;ource for him&s;elf;
and the baronet, ob&s;erving that time never hung
heavy upon his hands, conceived a yet higher ad|miration
of learning, and felt his &s;pirits proportion|ably
re-animated by the fair pro&s;pect of participating
in &s;uch advantages.</P>
<P>From this dream, however, he was &s;oon awakened:
a parcel, by the direction of Dr. Orkborne, arrived
from his book&s;eller, with materials for going to
work.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then &s;ent off a me&s;&s;age to the par&s;onage|hou&s;e,
informing his brother and his family, that
they mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed if they did not &s;ee or hear
of him for &s;ome time, as he had got his hands quite
full, and &s;hould be particularly engaged for a week
or two to come.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, &s;till but imperfectly conceiving the
extent, either of the plan, or of the &s;implicity of
his new pupil, propo&s;ed, as &s;oon as the packet was
opened, that they &s;hould read together; but Sir
Hugh replied, that he would do the whole in order,
and by no means &s;kip the rudiments.</P>
<P>The di&s;appointment which followed, may be ea&s;ily
imagined; with neither quickne&s;s to learn, nor me|mory
to retain, he aimed at being initiated in the
elements of a dead language, for which youth only
can find time and application, and even youth but by
compul&s;ion. His head &s;oon became confu&s;ed, his
ideas were all perplexed, his attention was vainly
&s;trained, and his faculties were totally di&s;ordered.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="44">
A&s;toni&s;hed at his own di&s;turbance, which he attri|buted
&s;olely to not getting yet into the right mode,
he laughed off his chagrin, but was &s;teady in his
per&s;everance; and continued wholly &s;hut up from his
family and friends, with a zeal worthy better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Le&s;&s;on after le&s;&s;on, however, only aggravated his
difficulties, till his intellects grew &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed he
&s;carce knew if he &s;lept or waked. His night be|came
infected by the perturbation of the day; his
health vi&s;ibly &s;uffered from the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of both,
and all his flattering hopes of new and unknown
happine&s;s were ere long exchanged for de&s;pair.</P>
<P>He now &s;ent for his brother, and de&s;ired to &s;peak
with him alone; when, catching him fa&s;t by the
hand, and looking piteou&s;ly in his face, &startq;Do you
know, my dear brother,&endq; he cried, &startq;I find my&s;elf
turning out as &s;heer a blockhead as ever, for all I
have got &s;o many more years over my head than
when I began all this hard jingle jangle before?&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, with greater concern than &s;urpri&s;e,
endeavoured to re-a&s;&s;ure and con&s;ole him, by pointing
out a $oad more attainable for reaping benefit from
the pre&s;ence of Dr. Orkborne, than the impracticable
path into which he had erroneou&s;ly entered.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! no, my dear brother,&endq; he an&s;wered; &startq;if
I don't &s;ucceed this way, I am &s;ure I &s;hall &s;ucceed
no other; for as to pains, I could not have taken
more if I had been afraid to be flogged once a-day:
and that gentleman has done all he can, too, as far as I
know to the contrary. But I really think, whatever's
the meaning of it, there's &s;ome people can't learn.</P>
<P>Then, &s;$aking his head, he added, in a low voice:
&startq;To &s;ay the truth, I might as well have given it up
from the very fir&s;t, for any great comfort I found in
it, if it had not been for fear of hurting that gen|tleman;
however, don't let the poor g$ntleman know
that; for I've no right to turn him off up in nothing,
merely for the fault of my having no head, which
how can he help?&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold agreed in the ju&s;tice of this reflection,
and undertook to deliberate upon &s;ome conciliatory
expedient.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45">
Sir Hugh heartily thanked him; &startq;But only in
the mean time that you are thinking,&endq; cried he,
&startq;how &s;hall I bring it about to &s;top him from coming
to me with all tho&s;e books for my &s;tudy? For, do
you know, my dear brother, becau&s;e I a&s;ked him to
buy me one for my beginning, he &s;ent for a full
&s;core? And when he comes to me about my le&s;&s;on,
he brings them all upon me together: which is one
thing, for ought I know, that helps to confu&s;e me; for
I am wondering all the while when I &s;hall get through
with them. However, &s;ay nothing of all this before the
poor gentleman, for fear he &s;hould take it as a hint;
which might put him out of heart: for which rea&s;on
I'd rather take another le&s;&s;on, Lord help me!&mdash;than
vex him.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold promi&s;ed his be&s;t con&s;ideration, and
to &s;e$ him again the next morning. But he had
hardly left Cleves ten minutes, when a man and hor&s;e
came galloping after him, with a petition that he
would return without delay.</P>
<P>The baronet received him with a countenance re|novated
with &s;elf-complacency. &startq;I won't trouble
you,&endq; he cried, &startq;to think any more; for now I
have got a plan of my own, which I will tell you.
Not to throw this good gentleman entirely away, I
intend having a &s;ort of a kind of &s;chool &s;et up here
in my &s;ick room, and &s;o to let all my nephews come,
and &s;ay their ta&s;ks to him in my hearing; and then,
who knows but I may pick up a little among&s;t them
my&s;elf, without all this hard &s;tudy?&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold &s;tated the obvious objections to fo
wild a &s;cheme; but he be&s;ought him not to oppo&s;e
it, as there was no other way for him to get rid of
his tutoring, without &s;ending off Dr. Orkborne.
He de&s;ired, therefore, that Lionel might come in|&s;tantly
to Cleves; &s;aying, I &s;hall write my&s;elf to
Eton, by the means of the Doctor, to tell the
Ma&s;ter I &s;hall take Clermont entirely home after
the next holidays, for the &s;ake of having him &s;tudy
under my own eye.&endq;</P>
<P>He then entreated him to prepare Dr. Orkborne
for his new avocation.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="46">
Mr. Tyrold, who &s;aw that in this plan the in|ventor
alone could be di&s;appointed, made no further
remon&s;trance, and communicated the de&s;ign to Dr.
Orkborne; who, growing now deeply engaged in his
own undertaking, was perfectly indifferent to whom
or to what his occa&s;ional attendance might be given.</P>

<P>MRS. TYROLD expre&s;&s;ed much a&s;toni&s;hment that
her hu&s;band could afford any countenance to this new
plan. &startq;Your expectations from it,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;can
be no higher than my own; you have certainly &s;ome
influence with your brother; why, then, will you
&s;uffer him thus egregiou&s;ly to expo&s;e him&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot protect his pride,&endq; an&s;wered Mr. Tyrold,
&startq;at the expence of his comfort. His faculties want
&s;ome object, his thoughts &s;ome employment. Inac|tion
bodily and intellectual pervading the &s;ame cha|racter,
cannot but &s;ix di&s;gu&s;t upon every &s;tage and
every &s;tate of life. Vice alone is wor&s;e than &s;uch
double inertion. Where mental vigour can be kept
alive without offence to religion and virtue, inno|cence
as well as happine&s;s is promoted; and the
&s;tarter of difficulties with regard to the means which
point to &s;uch an end, inadvertently ri&s;ks both. To
&s;ave the mind from preying inwardly upon it&s;elf&punc; it
mu&s;t be encouraged to &s;ome outward pur&s;uit. There
is no other way to elude apathy, or e&s;cape di&s;con|tent;
none other to guard the temper from that
quarrel with it&s;elf, which ultimately ends in quarrel|ling
with all mankind.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But may you not, by refu&s;ing to &s;end him
your &s;on, induce him to &s;eek recreation in &s;ome
more rational way?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Recreation, my dear Georgiana, mu&s;t be &s;pon|taneous.
Bidden plea&s;ures fly the perver&s;ity of our
<PB N="47" REF="47">
ta&s;tes. Let us take care, then, &s;crupulou&s;ly, of our
duties, but &s;uffer our amu&s;ements to take care of
them&s;elves. A project, a pa&s;time, &s;uch as this, is,
at lea&s;t, as harmle&s;s as it is hopele&s;s, &s;ince the utmo&s;t
&s;port of wit, or acrimony of malice, can only fa&s;ten
a laugh upon it: and how few are the diver&s;ions
of the rich and indolent that can &s;o lightly be ac|quitted!&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel, the new young &s;tudent, &s;peedily, though
but little to her &s;atisfaction, abetted the judgment
of his mother. He was no &s;ooner &s;ummoned to
Cleves, than, enchanted to find him&s;elf a fellow|pupil
with his uncle, he conceived the highe&s;t ideas
of his own premature genius: and when this vanity,
from the avowed ignorance of the artle&s;s baronet,
&s;ub&s;ided, it was only replaced by a &s;overeign con|tempt
of his new a&s;&s;ociate. He made the mo&s;t
pompous di&s;play of his own little acquirements; he
took every opportunity to a&s;k que&s;tions of Sir Hugh
which he knew he could not an&s;wer; and he would
&s;ometimes, with an arch mock &s;olemnity, carry his
exerci&s;e to him, and beg his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh bore this juvenile impertinence with un|&s;haken
good humour. But the &s;pirits of Lionel
were too mutinous for &s;uch lenity: he grew bolder
in his attacks, and more &s;earle&s;s of con&s;equences;
and in a very &s;hort time, his uncle &s;eemed to him
little more than the butt at which he might level
the &s;hafts of his ri&s;ing triumph; till tired, at length,
though not angry, the baronet applied to Dr. Ork|borne,
and begged he would teach him, out of
hand, &s;ome little &s;mattering of Latin &s;entences, by
which he might make the young pedant think bet|ter
of him.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne complied, and wrote him a few
brief exerci&s;es; but the&s;e, after toiling day and
night to learn, he pronounced &s;o ill, and &s;o con|&s;tantly
mi&s;applied, that, far from impre&s;&s;ing his fel|low-labourer
with more re&s;pect, the moment he ut|tered
a &s;ingle word of his new le&s;&s;on, the boy almo&s;t
rolled upon the floor with convul&s;ive merriment.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="48">
Sir Hugh, with whom the&s;e phra&s;es neither lo&s;t
nor gained by mi&s;taking one word for another, ap|pealed
to Dr. Orkborne to remedy what he conceiv|ed
to be an unaccountable failure. Dr. Orkborne,
ab&s;orbed in his new per&s;onal pur&s;uit, to which he
daily grew more devoted, was carne&s;t to be as little
as po&s;&s;ible interrupted, and therefore only advi&s;ed
him to &s;tudy his la&s;t le&s;&s;on, before he pre&s;&s;ed for
any thing new.</P>
<P>Study, however, was unavailing, and he heard
this injunction with de&s;pair; but finding it con|&s;tantly
repeated upon every application for help, he
was &s;eized again with a horror of the whole attempt,
and begged to con&s;ult with Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>&startq;This gentleman you have recommended to me
for my tutor,&endq; he cried, &startq;is certainly a great &s;cho|lar;
I don't mean to doubt that the lea&s;t in the
world, being no judge: and he is complai&s;ant enough
too, con&s;idering all that; but yet I have rather a
&s;u&s;picion he is afraid I &s;hall make no hand of it;
which is a thing &s;o di&s;heartening to a per&s;on in the
line of improvement, that, to tell you the hone&s;t
truth, I am thinking of giving the whole up at a
blow; for, Lord help me! what &s;hall I be the bet|ter
for knowing Latin and Greek? It's not worth
a man's while to think of it, after being a boy.
And &s;o, if you plea&s;e, I'd rather you'd take Lionel
home again.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold agreed; but a&s;ked what he meant to
do further concerning the Doctor?</P>
<P>&startq;Why that, brother, is the very thing my poor
ignorant head wants your advice for: becau&s;e, as
to that plan about our learning all together, I &s;ee
it won't do; for either the boys will grow up to
be no better &s;cholars than their uncle, which is to
&s;ay, none at all; or el&s;e they'll hold every body
cheap, when they meet with a per&s;on knowing no|thing;
&s;o I'll have no more hand in it. And I &s;hall
really be glad enough to get &s;uch a thing off my
mind; for it's been weight enough upon it from the
beginning.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="49">
He then de&s;ired the opinion of Mr. Tyrold what
&s;tep he &s;hould take to prevent the arrival of Cler|mont
Lynmere, whom, he &s;aid, he dreaded to &s;ee,
being determined to have no more little boys about
him for &s;ome time to come.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold recommended re-&s;ettling him at Eton:
but Sir Hugh declared he could not po&s;&s;ibly do that,
becau&s;e the poor little fellow had written him word
he was glad to leave &s;chool. &startq;And I don't doubt,&endq;
he added, &startq;but he'll make the be&s;t figure of us all;
becau&s;e I had him put in the right mode from the
fir&s;t; though, I mu&s;t needs own, I had as lieve &s;ee
him a mere dunce all his life, &s;uppo&s;ing I &s;hould live
&s;o long, which God forbid in regard to his dying,
as have him turn out a mer$ coxcomb of a pedant,
laughing and grinning at every body that can't &s;pell
a Greek noun.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold promi&s;ed to take the matter into con|&s;ideration;
but early the next morning, the baronet
again &s;ummoned him, and joyfully made known,
that a &s;cheme had come into his own head, which
an&s;wered all purpo&s;es. In the fir&s;t place, he &s;aid,
he had really taken &s;o prodigious a di&s;like to learn|ing,
that he was determined to &s;end Clermont over
the &s;eas, to fini&s;h his Greek and Latin; not be|cau&s;e
he was fond of foreign parts, but for fear, if
he &s;hould let him come to Cleves, the great di&s;ta&s;te
he had now conceived again&s;t tho&s;e &s;ort of lan|guages,
might di&s;gu&s;t the poor boy from his book.
And he had mo&s;t luckily recollected, in the middle
of the night, that he had a dear friend, one Mr.
We&s;twyn, who was going the very next month to
carry his own &s;on to Leip&s;ic; which was ju&s;t what
had put the thought into his head; becau&s;e, by that
means, Clermont might be removed from one &s;tudy|ing
place to t'other, without lo&s;s of time.</P>
<P>&startq;But for all that,&endq; he continued, &startq;as this good
gentleman here has been doing no harm, I won't
have him become a &s;ufferer for my changing my mind:
and &s;o, not to affront him by giving him nothing to
<PB N="50" REF="50">
do, which would be like &s;aying, `You may go your
ways,' I intend he &s;hould try Indiana.&endq;</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving Mr. Tyrold now look with the ex|treme&s;t
&s;urpri&s;e, he added; &startq;To be &s;ure, being a
girl, it is rather out of the way; but as there is
never another boy, what can I do? Be&s;ides I &s;han't
&s;o much mind her getting a little learning, becau&s;e
&s;he's not likely to make much hand of it. And
this one thing, I can tell you, which I have learnt
of my own accord; I'll never pre&s;s a per&s;on to &s;et
about &s;tudying at my time of life as long as I live,
knowing what a plague it is.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel returned to Etherington with his father,
and the re&s;t of the &s;cheme was put into execution
without delay. Mr. We&s;twyn conveyed Clermont
from Eton to Leip&s;ic, where he &s;ettled him with
the preceptor and ma&s;ters appointed for his own
&s;on; and Dr. Orkborne was de&s;ired to become the
tutor of Indiana.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, quitting his learned re&s;idence, the Doctor
might indignantly have blu&s;hed at the propo&s;ition
of an employment &s;o much beneath his abilities:
but he now heard it without the &s;malle&s;t emotion;
&s;edately revolving in his mind, that his literary work
would not be affected by the ignorance or ab&s;urdity
of his &s;everal pupils.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tuition of a young Lady.</HEAD>
<P>THE $air Indiana participated not in the philo&s;o|phy
of her preceptor. The fir&s;t mention of tak|ing
le&s;&s;ons produced an aver&s;ion unconquerable to
their teacher; and the fir&s;t que&s;tion he a&s;ked her at
the appointed hour for &s;tudy, was an&s;wered by a
bur&s;t of tears.</P>
<P>To Dr. Orkborne this &s;orrow would have proved
no impediment to their proceeding, as he hardly
<PB N="51" REF="51">
noticed it; but Sir Hugh, extremely affected, kindly
ki&s;&s;ed her, and &s;aid he would beg her off for this
time. The next day, however, gave ri&s;e but to a
&s;imilar &s;cene; and the next which followed would
preci&s;ely have re&s;embled it, had not the promi&s;e of
&s;ome new finery of attire di&s;per&s;ed the pearly drops
that were preparing to fall.</P>
<P>The uncommon beauty of India had made her
infancy adored, and her childhood indulged by al|mo&s;t
all who had &s;een her. The brilliant picture &s;he
pre&s;ented to the eye by her &s;miles and her &s;pirits,
rendered the deva&s;tation cau&s;ed by crying, pouting,
or fretfulne&s;s &s;o &s;triking, and &s;o painful to behold,
that not alone her uncle, but every &s;ervant in the
hou&s;e, and every &s;tranger who vi&s;ited it, granted to
her lamentations whatever they demanded, to relieve
their own impatience at the lo&s;s of &s;o plea&s;ing an
image. Accu&s;tomed, therefore, never to weep with|out
advantage, &s;he was in the con&s;tant habit of giv|ing
unbridled vent to her tears upon the &s;malle&s;t con|tradiction,
well knowing that not to &s;poil her pretty
eyes by crying, was the current maxim of the whole
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Unu&s;ed, by this means, to any trouble or appli|cation,
the purpo&s;ed tuition of Dr. Orkborne ap|peared
a burden to her intolerable; yet weeping, her
&s;tanding re&s;ource, was with him utterly vain; her
tears were unimportant to one who had taken no no|tice
of her &s;miles; and, intent upon his own learned
ruminations, he never even looked at her.</P>
<P>Bribery, day after day, could procure but a few
in&s;tants attention, given &s;o unwillingly, and &s;o &s;pee|dily
withdrawn, that trinkets, dre&s;s, and excur&s;ions
were &s;oon exhau&s;ted, without the &s;malle&s;t advance|ment.
The general indulgence of the baronet made
partial favours of &s;mall efficacy; and Indiana was
&s;ooner tired of receiving, than he of pre&s;enting, his
offerings.</P>
<P>She applied, therefore, at length to the governe&s;s,
who&s;e expo&s;tulations, &s;he knew by experience, were
<PB N="52" REF="52">
preci&s;ely what Sir Hugh mo&s;t &s;edulou&s;ly aimed to
avoid.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Marg$and was a woman of family and fa&s;hion,
but reduced, through the gaming and extravagance
of her father, to &s;uch indigence, that, after &s;undry
failures in higher attempts, &s;he was compelled to ac|quie&s;ce
in the good offices of her friends, which placed
her as a governe&s;s in the hou&s;e of Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>To Indiana, however, &s;he was but nominally a
tutore&s;s; neglected in her own education, there was
nothing &s;he could teach, though, born and bred in
the circle of fa&s;hion, &s;he imagined &s;he had nothing
to learn. And, while a mind proudly &s;hallow kept
her unacquainted with her own deficiencies, her for|mer
rank in &s;ociety impo&s;ed an equal ignorance of
them upon Sir Hugh. But, notwith&s;tanding he
implicitly gave her credit for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing whatever &s;he
a&s;&s;umed, he &s;ound her of a temper &s;o unplea&s;ant,
and &s;o irritable to o&s;&s;ence, that he made it a rule
never to differ from her. The irk&s;omene&s;s of this
re&s;traint induced him to keep as much as po&s;&s;ible out
of her way; though re&s;pect and pity for her birth
and her misfortunes, led him to re&s;olve never to part
with her till Indiana was married.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of Mi&s;s Margland was as haughty as
her intellects were weak; and her di&s;po&s;ition was &s;o
querulous, that, in her con&s;tant &s;u&s;picion of humi|liation,
&s;he &s;eemed always looking for an affront,
and ready primed for a conte&s;t.</P>
<P>She &s;eized with plea&s;ure the opportunity offered
her by Indiana, of remon&s;trating again&s;t this new
&s;y&s;tem of education; readily allowing, that any ac|compli&s;hment
beyond what &s;he had her&s;elf acquired,
would be completely a work of &s;upererogation. She
repre&s;ented dictatorily her objections to the baronet.
Mi&s;s Lynmere, &s;he &s;aid, though both beautiful and
well brought up, could never cope with &s;o great a
di&s;advantage as the knowledge of Latin: &startq;Con&s;ider,
Sir,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;what an ob&s;tacle it will prove to
her making her way in the great world, when &s;he
comes to be of a proper age for thinking of an
<PB N="53" REF="53">
e&s;tabli&s;hment. What gentleman will you ever find
that will bear with a learned wife? except &s;ome mere
downright fogrum, that no young lady of fa&s;hion
could endure.&endq;</P>
<P>She then &s;poke of the danger of injuring her
beauty by &s;tudy; and ran over all the qualifications
really nece&s;&s;ary for a young lady to attain, which
con&s;i&s;ted &s;imply of an enumeration of all &s;he had her|&s;elf
attempted; a little mu&s;ic, a little drawing, and
a little dancing; which &s;hould all, &s;he added, be but
&s;lightly pur&s;ued, to di&s;tingui&s;h a lady of fa&s;hion
from an arti&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, a good deal di&s;turbed, becau&s;e unable
to an&s;wer her, thought it would be be&s;t to intere&s;t
Dr. Orkborne in his plan, and to beg him to recon|cile
her to its execution. He &s;ent, therefore, a
me&s;&s;age to the Doctor, to beg to &s;peak with him
immediately.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne promi&s;ed to wait upon him without
delay: but he was at that moment hunting for a
pa&s;&s;age in a Greek author, and pre&s;ently forgot both
the promi&s;e and the reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, concluding nothing but &s;ickne&s;s could
detain him, went to his apartment; where, finding
him perfectly well, he &s;tared at him a moment; and
then, &s;itting down, begged him to make no apo|logy,
for he could tell his bu&s;ine&s;s there as well as
any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>He gave a long and copious relation of the ob|jections
of Mi&s;s Margland, earne&s;tly begging Dr.
Orkborne would &s;ave him from &s;uch another ha|rangue,
it being bad for his health, by undertaking
to give her the proper notion of things him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Doctor, who had ju&s;t found the pa&s;&s;age for
which he had been &s;eeking, heard not one word that
he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, receiving no an&s;wer, imagined him to
be weighing the &s;ub&s;tance of his narration; and,
therefore, bidding him not worry his brain too
much, offered him half an hour to fix upon what
<PB N="54" REF="54">
&s;hould be done; and returned quietly to his own
room.</P>
<P>Here he &s;at, counting the minutes, with his watch
in his hand, till the time &s;tipulated arrived: but
finding Dr. Orkborne let it pa&s;s without any notice,
he again took the trouble of going back to his apart|ment.</P>
<P>He then eagerly a&s;ked what plan he had formed?</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, much incommoded by this &s;econd
interruption, coldly begged to know his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, with great patience, though much &s;ur|pri&s;e,
repeated the whole, word for word, over again:
but the hi&s;tory was far too long for Dr. Orkborne,
who&s;e attention, after the fir&s;t &s;entence or two, was
completely re&s;tored to his Greek quotation, which
he was in the act of tran&s;cribing when Sir Hugh re|entered
the room.</P>
<P>The baronet, at length, more categorically &s;aid,
&startq;Don't be &s;o &s;hy of &s;peaking out, Doctor; though
I am afraid, by your &s;ilence, you've rather a notion
poor Indiana will never get on; which, perhaps,
makes you think it not worth while contradicting
Mrs. Margland? Come, &s;peak out!&mdash;Is that the
ca&s;e with the poor girl?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Sir,&endq; an&s;wered Dr. Orkborne, with great
compo&s;ure; though perfectly uncon&s;cious of the
propo&s;ition to which he a&s;&s;ented.</P>
<P>&startq;Lack-a day! if I was not always afraid &s;he had
rather a turn to being a dunce! So it's your opi|nion
it won't do, then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Sir,&endq; again replied the Doctor; his eye
the whole time fa&s;tened upon the pa&s;&s;age which oc|cupied
his thoughts.</P>
<P>&startq;Why then we are all at a &s;tand again! This is
wor&s;e than I thought for! So the poor dear girl has
really no head?&mdash;Hay, Doctor?&mdash;Do &s;peak, pray?
&mdash;Don't mind vexing me. Say &s;o at once, if you
can't help thinking it.&endq;</P>
<P>Another extorted, &startq;Yes, Sir,&endq; completely over|&s;et
Sir Hugh; who, imputing the ab&s;ent and per|plexed
air with which it was pronounced to an un|willingne&s;s
<PB N="55" REF="55">
to give pain, &s;hook him by the hand, and&punc;
quitting the room, ordered his carriage, and &s;et off
for Etherington.</P>
<P>&startq;Oh, brother,&endq; he cried; &startq;Indiana's the be&s;t
girl in the world, as well as the prettie&s;t; but, do
you know, Dr. Orkborne &s;ays &s;he has got no brains!
So there's an end of that &s;cheme! However, I have
now thought of another that will &s;ettle all differ|ences.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold hoped it was an entire di&s;continuance
of all pupilage and tutor&s;hip; and that Dr. Orkborne
might henceforth be con&s;idered as a mere family friend.</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, my dear brother, no! 'tis a better
thing than that, as you &s;hall hear. You mu&s;t know
I have often been concerned to think how glum poor
Clermont will look when he hears of my will in fa|vour
of Eugenia; which was my chief rea&s;on in
my own private mind, for not caring to &s;ee him be|fore
he went abroad; but I have made my&s;elf quite
ea&s;y about him now, by re&s;olving to &s;et little Eu|genia
upon learning the cla&s;&s;ics.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Eugenia! and of what benefit will that prove
to Clermont?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, as &s;oon as &s;he grows a little old, that is
to &s;ay, a young woman, I intend, with your good
will and my &s;i&s;ter's, to marry her to Clermont.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold &s;miled, but declared his entire con|currence,
if the young people, when they grew up,
wi&s;hed for the alliance.</P>
<P>&startq;As to that,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I mean to make &s;ure
work, by having them educated exactly to fit one
another. I &s;hall order Clermont to think of nothing
but his &s;tudies till the proper time; and as to Eu|genia,
I &s;hall make her a wife after his own heart,
by the help of this gentleman; for I intend to bid
him teach her ju&s;t like a man, which, as &s;he's &s;o
young, may be done from the beginning, the &s;ame
as if &s;he was a boy.&endq;</P>
<P>He then enumerated the advantages of this pro|ject,
which would &s;ave Clermont from all di&s;appoint|ment,
by &s;till making over to him his whole fortune,
<PB N="56" REF="56">
with a wife ready formed into a complete &s;cholar for
him into the bargain. It would al&s;o hinder Eugenia
from being a prey to &s;ome fop for her money, who,
being no relation, could not have &s;o good a right to
it; and it would prevent any affront to Dr. Orkborne,
by keeping him a con&s;tant tight ta&s;k in hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold forbore to chagrin him with any &s;trong
expo&s;tulation, and he returned, therefore, to Cleves
in full glee. He repaired immediately to the apart|ment
of the Doctor, who, only by what was now
&s;aid, was apprized of what had pa&s;&s;ed before. Some|what,
therefore, alarmed, to under&s;tand that the
&s;tudies of Indiana were to be relinqui&s;hed, he exerted
all the alacrity in his power for accepting his new
little pupil: not from any idea of preference; for
he concluded the incapacity of Indiana to be rather
that of her &s;ex than of an individual; but from con|ceiving
that his commodious abode at Cleves depend|ed
upon his retaining one &s;cholar in the family. Eu|genia
therefore was called, and the le&s;&s;ons were begun.</P>
<P>The little girl, who was naturally of a thoughtful
turn, and who&s;e &s;tate of health deprived her of mo&s;t
childi&s;h amu&s;ements, was well contented with the ar|rangement,
and &s;oon made a progre&s;s &s;o &s;atisfactory
to Dr. Orkborne, that Sir Hugh, letting his mind
now re&s;t from all other &s;chemes, became fully and
happily occupied by the pro&s;ecution of his la&s;t &s;ug|ge&s;tion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lo&s;t Labour.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this period, the families of Etherington
and Cleves lived in the enjoyment of uninterrupted
harmony and repo&s;e, till Eugenia, the mo&s;t juvenile
of the &s;et, had attained her fifteenth year.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="57">
Sir Hugh then wrote to Leip&s;ie, de&s;iring his
nephew Lynmere to return home without delay.
&startq;Not that I intend,&endq; he &s;aid to Mr. Tyrold,
&startq;marrying them together at this young age, Eu|genia
being but a child, except in point of Latin;
though I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear brother, &s;he's the mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible of the whole, poor Indiana being nothing to
her, for all her prettine&s;s; but the thing is, the
&s;ooner Clermont comes over, the &s;ooner they may
begin forming the proper regard.&endq;</P>
<P>The knowledge of this projected alliance was by
no means confined to Sir Hugh and Mr. and Mrs.
Tyrold; it was known throughout the family, though
never publicly announced, and under&s;tood from her
childhood by Eugenia her&s;elf, though Mrs. Tyrold
had exerted her utmo&s;t authority to prevent Sir
Hugh from apprizing her of it in form. It was ne|verthele&s;s,
the joy of his heart to prepare the young
people for each other: and his &s;cheme received every
encouragement he could de&s;ire, from the zeal and
uncommon progre&s;s in her &s;tudies made by Eugenia;
which mo&s;t happily corre&s;ponded with all his in|junctions
to Leip&s;ic, for the application and acqui$$|ments
of Clermont.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, it was a blow to him the
mo&s;t unexpected, to receive from the young bride|groom
elect, in an&s;wer to his &s;ummons home, a peti|tion
to make the tour of Europe, while yet on the
continent.</P>
<P>&startq;What!&endq; cried Sir Hugh, &startq;and is this all his
care for us? after &s;o many years &s;eparation from his
kin and kind, has he no natural longings to &s;ee his
native land? no yearnings to know his own relations
from &s;trangers?&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, notwith&s;tanding her extreme youth, &s;e|cretly
applauded and admired a &s;earch of knowledge
&s;he would gladly have participated; though &s;he was
not incurious to &s;ee the youth &s;he con&s;idered as her
de&s;tined partner for life, and to whom all her literary
labours had been directed: for the never-failing me|thod
of Sir Hugh to &s;timulate her if &s;he was idle,
<PB N="58" REF="58">
had been to a&s;&s;ure her that, unle&s;s &s;he worked
harder, her cou&s;in Clermont would eclip&s;e her.</P>
<P>She had now acquired a decided ta&s;te for &s;tudy,
which, however unu&s;ual for her age, mo&s;t fortunately
re&s;cued from wearine&s;s or &s;adne&s;s the &s;edentary life,
which a weak &s;tate of health compelled her to lead.
This induced her to look with plea&s;ure upon Cler|mont
as the object of her emulation, and to pro&s;e|cute
every plan for her improvement, with that vi|gour
which accompanies a pur&s;uit of our own choice;
the only labour that a&s;ks no relaxation.</P>
<P>Steady occupations, &s;uch as the&s;e, kept off all
attention to her per&s;onal misfortunes, which Sir
Hugh had &s;trictly ordered &s;hould never be alluded
to; fir&s;t, he &s;aid, for fear they &s;hould vex her; and
next, le&s;t they &s;hould make her hate him, for being
their cau&s;e. Tho&s;e incidents, therefore, from never
being named, glided imperceptibly from her thoughts;
and &s;he grew up as uncon&s;cious as &s;he was innocent,
that, though born with a beauty which &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
that of her lovely &s;i&s;ters, di&s;ea&s;e and accident had
robbed her of that charm ere &s;he knew &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
it. But neither di&s;ea&s;e nor accident had power over
her mind; there, in its pure&s;t proportions, moral
beauty pre&s;erved its fir&s;t energy. The equanimity
of her temper made her &s;eem, though a female, born
to be a practical philo&s;opher; her abilities and her
&s;entiments were each of the highe&s;t cla&s;s, uniting
the be&s;t adorned intellects with the be&s;t principled
virtues.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;atisfaction of Sir Hugh with his nephew
reached not to prohibition: his con&s;ent was painful,
but his remittances were generous, and Clermont had
three years allowed him for his travels through Eu|rope.</P>
<P>Yet this permi&s;&s;ion was no &s;ooner granted than the
baronet again became dejected. Three years ap|peared
to him to be endle&s;s: he could hardly per|&s;uade
him&s;elf to look forward to them with expecta+tion
of life; and all the learned labours he had pro|moted
&s;eemed vain and unpromi&s;ing, ill requiting his
<PB N="59" REF="59">
toils, and &s;till le&s;s an&s;wering his hopes. Even the
&s;tudious turn of Eugenia, hitherto his fir&s;t delight,
he now thought &s;erved but to render her un&s;ociable;
and the time &s;he devoted to &s;tudy, he began to regret
as lo&s;t to him&s;elf; nor could he &s;ugge&s;t any po&s;&s;ible
con&s;olation for his drooping &s;pirits, till it occurred to
him that Camilla might again enliven him.</P>
<P>This idea, and the order for his carriage, were the
birth of the &s;ame moment; and, upon entering the
&s;tudy of Mr. Tyrold, he abruptly exclaimed, &startq;My
dear brother, I mu&s;t have Camilla back! Indiana
&s;ays nothing to amu&s;e me; and Eugenia is &s;o booki&s;h,
I might as well live with an old woman; which God
forbid I &s;hould object to, only I like Camilla better.&endq;</P>
<P>This reque&s;t was by no means welcome to Mr.
Tyrold, and utterly di&s;ta&s;teful to his lady. Camilla
was now ju&s;t &s;eventeen years of age, and attractively
lovely; but of a character that called for more at|tention
to its developement than to its formation;
though of a di&s;po&s;ition &s;o engaging, that affection
kept pace with watchfulne&s;s, and her fond parents
knew as little for their own &s;akes as for her's how to
part with her.</P>
<P>Her qualities had a power which, without con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
how, or con&s;ideration why, governed her
whole family. The airy thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of her nature
was a &s;ource of perpetual amu&s;ement; and, if &s;ome|times
her vivacity rai&s;ed a fear for her di&s;cretion, the
innocence of her mind rea&s;&s;ured them after every
alarm. The intere&s;t which &s;he excited &s;erved to
render her the fir&s;t object of the hou&s;e; it was ju&s;t
&s;hort of &s;olicitude, yet kept it con&s;tantly alive. Her
&s;pirits were volatile, but her heart was tender; her
gaiety had a fa&s;cination; her per&s;ua&s;ion was irre|&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>To give her now up to Sir Hugh, &s;eemed to Mrs.
Tyrold rather impo&s;&s;ible than di&s;agreeable; but he
was too urgent with his brother to be wholly refu&s;ed.
She was granted him, therefore, as a gue&s;t, for the
three en&s;uing months, to aid him to di&s;&s;ipate his im|mediate
di&s;appointment, from the pr$cra&s;tinated ab|&s;ence
of Clermont.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="60">
Sir Hugh received back his fir&s;t favourite with all
the fond glee of a ductile imagination, which in every
new good &s;ees a refuge from every pa&s;t or pre&s;ent
evil. But, as the extreme&s;t di&s;ta&s;te of all literature
now &s;ucceeded tho&s;e &s;anguine views which had lately
made it his exclu&s;ive object, the fir&s;t words he &s;poke
upon her arrival were, to inform her &s;he mu&s;t learn
no Latin; and the fir&s;t &s;tep which followed her wel|come,
was a &s;olemn charge to Dr. Orkborne, that
he mu&s;t give her no le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>The gaiety, the &s;pirit, the playful good humour
of Camilla, had lo&s;t nothing of their charm by added
years, though her under&s;tanding had been &s;edulou&s;ly
cultivated, and her principles modelled by the pure
and practical tenets of her exemplary parents. The
delight of Sir Hugh in regaining her, con&s;i&s;ted not
merely of the renovation of his fir&s;t prejudice in her
favour; it was &s;trengthened by the re&s;toration it af|forded
his own mind to its natural &s;tate, and the relief
of being di&s;burthened of a ta&s;k he was &s;o ill cal|culated
to undertake, as &s;uperintending, in any &s;ort,
intellectual pur&s;uits.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">New Projects.</HEAD>
<P>THE baronet would, at length, have enjoyed
perfect contentment, had he not been mole&s;ted by
the tea&s;ing &s;pirit of Mi&s;s Margland, now daily at
work in propo&s;ing a journey to London, and in re|pre&s;enting
as an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, that the young
ladies &s;hould &s;ee and be &s;een, in a manner &s;uitable to
their &s;ituation in life.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, equally void either of ta&s;te or of
re&s;ources for the country, had langui&s;hed and fretted
away twelve years in its bo&s;om, $word$ no other open|ing
to any &s;atisfaction beyond a maintenance, except
<PB N="61" REF="61">
what &s;he &s;ecretly nouri&s;hed in her hopes, that, when
her beautiful pupil was grown up, &s;he &s;hould accom|pany
her to the metropolis. Her former connections
and acquaintance in high life &s;till continued to be the
&s;tationary pride of her heart, the con&s;tant theme of
her di&s;cour&s;e, and the perpetual allu&s;ion of &s;ome la|mentation
and regret. This excur&s;ion, therefore, in
pro&s;pect, had been her &s;ole &s;upport during her re|tirement;
nor had &s;he failed to in&s;truct her fair di&s;|ciple
to aid her &s;cheme, though &s;he had kept from
her its private motive.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully, indeed, had &s;he in&s;tilled into the
youthful brea&s;t of Indiana, a wondering curio&s;ity to
&s;ee the place which &s;he de&s;cribed as the &s;ole re&s;idence
of elegance and fa&s;hion, and an eager impatience to
exhibit there a per&s;on which &s;he was a&s;&s;ured would
meet with univer&s;al homage.</P>
<P>But neither the exhortations of the governe&s;s, nor
the wi&s;hes of her pupil, could in this point move Sir
Hugh. He had a fixt aver&s;ion to London, and to
all public places, and had con&s;tantly &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter to
relate of every vi&s;it he had accidentally made to them.
The amu&s;ements which had decided his partiality for
the country were now, indeed, no longer within his
reach; but his &s;anguine temper, which occa&s;ionally
entertained him with hopes of a recovery, determined
him always to keep upon the right &s;pot, he &s;aid, for
&s;port, in ca&s;e of any &s;udden and favourable change
in his health.</P>
<P>Upon the vi&s;it of Camilla, Mi&s;s Margland grew
yet more urgent, expecting through her powerful
influence to gain her point. She &s;trove, therefore,
to engage her interce&s;&s;ion, but Camilla, carele&s;s, ea&s;y
and gay, had no wi&s;h about the matter, and could
not be brought into the cabal.</P>
<P>This di&s;appointment &s;o much &s;oured and provoked
Mi&s;s Margland, that &s;he lo&s;t the u&s;ual di&s;cretion &s;he
had hitherto practi&s;ed, of confining her remon&s;trances
to tho&s;e times when &s;he &s;aw Sir Hugh alone. Such
opportunities, indeed, weary of the u&s;e &s;he made of
them, the baronet contrived daily to le&s;&s;en; but every
<PB N="62" REF="62">
meeting now, whether public or private, was &s;eized
alike for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and the nece&s;&s;ity of
<HI>bringing the young ladies out,</HI> and the duty of <HI>thinking
of their e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> were the &s;entences with which
he was &s;o regularly a&s;&s;ailed, that the moment he &s;aw
her he prepared to hear them, and commonly with
an heavy &s;igh anticipated their fatigue to his &s;pirits.</P>
<P>No arguments, however, relative to di&s;po&s;ing of
the young ladies, had any weight with him; he had
long planned to give Eugenia to Clermont Lynmere,
and he depended upon Edgar Mandlebert for In|diana,
while with regard to Camilla, to keep her
unmarried, that he might detain her under his own
roof, was the favourite wi&s;h of his heart. Never|thele&s;s,
this perpetual per&s;ecution became by degrees
in&s;upportable, and, unu&s;ed to be deaf to any claimant,
he was upon the point of con&s;trained compliance,
when his pa&s;&s;ion for forming &s;chemes came again to
his aid, upon hearing that Edgar Mandlebert, after
a twelvemonth's ab&s;ence, was ju&s;t returned to Ether|ington.</P>
<P>This youth had been making the tour of England,
Wales, and Scotland, with Dr. Marchmont, who
had been induced by Mr. Tyrold to relinqui&s;h all
other avocations, and devote to him his whole time.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh ha&s;tening, upon this news, to the par|&s;onage-hou&s;e,
&s;aid: &startq;Don't imagine, brother, I am
going to make any complaint again&s;t Mrs. Margland,
for &s;he is an excellent governe&s;s, and I have no fault
to find with her, except her making too many ob|jections,
which I take to be her wor&s;t part; but as
every body has &s;omething, it would be very unfair
to quarrel with her for &s;uch a mere nothing, e&s;pecially
as &s;he can't help it, after &s;o many years going on
the &s;ame way, without coming to a &s;top; but the
thing I have thought of now may &s;et it all to rights,
which I hope you'll approve, and e&s;pecially my
&s;i&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>He then explained, that as he had fixt upon
marrying Eugenia to Clermont Lynmere, &s;he was
put &s;o completely under the care of Dr. Orkborne,
<PB N="63" REF="63">
in order to make her fit for the young &s;cholar, that
Mi&s;s Margland was of little or no u&s;e to her. He
meant, therefore, to bring forward immediately the
marriage of Indiana with young Mandlebert, and
then to a&s;k Mi&s;s Margland to go and live with them
entirely, as he could very well &s;pare her: &startq;This,&endq;
he continued, &startq;Indiana can't object to, from the
point of having had her &s;o long; and young Mr.
Edgar's remarkably complai&s;ant, for &s;uch a young
youth, which I &s;aw a great while ago. By this
means, Mrs. Margland will get her main end of
going to London, which &s;he may &s;how off to the
young bride, without my budging from home, Lord
help me! being a thing I don't much like, to be
taken about to dances and &s;hews, now that I am not
a boy; &s;o then Camilla will be left to &s;tay with me,
for my own companion; which I a&s;&s;ure you I de&s;ire
no better, though &s;he knows no more, as the Doctor
tells me, of the cla&s;&s;ics, than my old &s;paniel; which,
to give every one his due, is much the &s;ame with
my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, with a very unplea&s;ant a&s;toni&s;hment,
enquired further into his meaning concerning Man|dlebert;
but his &s;urpri&s;e ended in a &s;mile, when he
heard the juvenile circum&s;tances upon which alone
Sir Hugh built his expectations. To argue with
him, however, was always fruitle&s;s; he had found
out, he &s;aid, the intentions of Edgar from the fir&s;t,
and he came now to invite him to pa&s;s a month at
Cleves, for the &s;ake of cutting the court&s;hip &s;hort,
by letting him &s;ee Indiana every day, &s;o that no
time might be lo&s;t in coming to the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t wi&s;h of the &s;ecret heart of Mr. Tyrold
was, that one of its own daughters &s;hould be the
choice of his ward; he did not, therefore, totally
unmoved, hear this project for Indiana, though its
ba&s;is was &s;o little alarming.</P>
<P>Edgar, who was now ju&s;t of age, was receiving
the la&s;t cares of his guardian, and taking into his
own hands his fortune and affairs. He was at Ether|ington,
at pre&s;ent, only for that purpo&s;e, Beech-Park
being already fitted up for his re&s;idence.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="64">
Sir Hugh, de&s;iring to &s;peak with him, mo&s;t cor|dially
made his invitation: &startq;Be&s;ides my&s;elf,&endq; he
cried, &startq;whom I only mention fir&s;t, as being ma&s;ter
of the hou&s;e, which I hope is my excu&s;e for it, you
will meet three very good young girls, not to mention
Dr. Orkborne and Mi&s;s Margland, who are rather
not of the younge&s;t at pre&s;ent, whatever they may
have been in former times; and they will all, my&s;elf
included, make you as welcome as them&s;elves.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar accepted the propo&s;al with plea&s;ure, and
agreed to wait upon him the next day, Mr. Tyrold
con&s;enting that they &s;hould tran&s;act their mutual
bu&s;ine&s;s at Etherington, by morning rides.</P>
<P>At dinner Sir Hugh told the family at Cleves the
new gue&s;t they were &s;o &s;oon to expect, a&s;&s;uring them
he was become a very fine young gentleman, and
bidding Indiana, with a &s;ignificant nod, hold up her
head.</P>
<P>Indiana wanted no charge upon this &s;ubject; &s;he
fully under&s;tood the views of her uncle, and it was
now &s;ome years &s;ince &s;he had heard the name of
Beech-Park without a &s;mile or a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of the young man, Sir Hugh
&s;ummoned his hou&s;ehold to meet him in the hall,
where he received him with an hearty welcome, and,
in the flutter of his &s;pirits, introduced him to them
all, as if this had been his fir&s;t appearance in the
family; remarking, that a full week of &s;hyne&s;s
might be &s;aved, by making acquaintance with the
whole &s;et in a clump.</P>
<P>From eagerne&s;s irrepre&s;&s;ible, he began with In|diana,
apologi&s;ing when he had done, by &s;aying it
was only becau&s;e &s;he was olde&s;t, having the advantage
of three weeks over Camilla: &startq;For which, how|ever,&endq;
he added, &startq;I mu&s;t beg pardon of Mrs. Marg|land
and Dr. Orkborne, who, to be &s;ure, mu&s;t be
pretty much older.&endq;</P>
<P>He next pre&s;ented him to Camilla; and, then,
taking him apart, begged, in a whi&s;per, that he
would not &s;eem to notice the ugline&s;s of Eugenia,
which, he &s;aid, was never mentioned in her hearing,
<PB N="65" REF="65">
by his particular order; &startq;though, to be &s;ure,&endq; he
added, &startq;&s;ince the &s;mall-pox, &s;he's grown plain enough,
in point of beauty, con&s;idering how pretty &s;he was
before. However, &s;he's a remarkably good girl, and
with regard to Virgil and tho&s;e others will po&s;e you
in a &s;econd, for aught I know to the contrary, being
but an indifferent judge in things of that &s;ort, from
leaving off my own &s;tudies rather &s;hort, on account
of the gout; be&s;ides &s;ome other rea&s;ons.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar a&s;&s;ured him the&s;e introductions were by no
means nece&s;&s;ary, a &s;ingle twelvemouth's ab&s;ence being
very in&s;ufficient to obliterate from his memory his be&s;t
and earlie&s;t friends.</P>
<P>Edgar Mandlebert was a young man who, if po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
neither of fortune nor its expectations, mu&s;t
from his per&s;on and his manners have been as attractive
to the young, as from his morals and his conduct to
tho&s;e of riper years. His di&s;po&s;ition was &s;erious and
meditative; but liberal, open, and candid. He was
ob&s;ervant of the errors of others, and watched
till he nearly eradicated his own. But though with
difficulty he be&s;towed admiration, he diffu&s;ed both
in words and deeds, &s;uch general amity and good
will, that if the &s;trictne&s;s of his character in&s;pired
general re&s;pect, its virtues could no le&s;s fail engaging
the kinder mode of affection. When to merit of a
&s;pecies &s;o rare were added a fine e&s;tate and a large
independent fortune, it is not ea&s;y to decide whether
in pro&s;perity or de&s;ert he was mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t week which he &s;pent at Cleves, was pa&s;&s;ed
with a gaiety as unremitting as it was innocent. All
parties felt his arrival as an acqui&s;ition: Indiana
thought the hour of public exhibition, long promi&s;ed
by Mi&s;s Margland, at length fa&s;t approaching; Ca|milla,
who e&s;caped all expectation for her&s;elf, from
being informed of what was entertained by her cou&s;in,
enjoyed the tranquil plea&s;ure of unde&s;igning friend|&s;hip,
unchequered either by hope or fear; Eugenia
met with a re&s;pect for her acquirements that re|doubled
her ambition to increa&s;e them; Sir Hugh
looked forward with joy to the happy di&s;|po&s;al
<PB N="66" REF="66">
of Indiana, and a blamele&s;s riddance of Mi&s;s
Margland; who, on her part, with an almo&s;t bound|le&s;s
&s;atisfaction, &s;aw her near return to a town life,
from the high favour in which &s;he &s;tood with the
&s;uppo&s;ed bride elect; even Dr. Orkborne, though
he di&s;dained with &s;o young a &s;cholar to enter into
much philological di&s;qui&s;ition, was gratified by a
pre&s;ence which afforded a little relief to the &s;tores of
his burthened memory, from authorizing &s;ome occa|&s;ional
utterance of the learned recollections, which
for many years had encumbered it without vent.
Edgar, meanwhile, obliging and obliged, received
plea&s;ure from, them all; for though not blind to any
of their imperfections, they had not a merit which
he failed to di&s;cern.</P>
<P>The &s;econd week opened with a plan which pro|mi&s;ed
a &s;cene more lively, though it broke it into the
calm retirement of this peaceful party. Lionel, who
was now at Etherington, to &s;pend his univer&s;ity va|cation,
rode over to Cleves, to inform Edgar, that
there would be a ball the next evening at Northwick,
at which the officers of the *** regiment, which
was quartered in the neighbourhood, and all the
beaux and belles of the county, were expected to a&s;|&s;emble.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, who was pre&s;ent, &s;truck with
a de&s;ire that Indiana might make her fir&s;t public ap|pearance
in the county, at a ball where Edgar might
be her partner, went in&s;tantly to Sir Hugh to impart
the idea. Sir Hugh, though aver&s;e to all public
places, con&s;ented to the plan, from the hope of ac|celerating
the affair; but declared, that if there was
any amu&s;ement, his little Camilla &s;hould not be left out.
Eugenia, won by the novelty of a fir&s;t expedition of
this &s;ort, made her own reque&s;t to be included;
Lionel undertook to procure tickets, and Mi&s;s Mar|gland
had the welcome labour of arranging their
dre&s;s, for which Sir Hugh, to atone for the &s;hortne&s;s
of the time, gave her powers unlimited.</P>
<P>Indiana was almo&s;t di&s;tracted with joy at this event.
Mi&s;s Margland a&s;&s;ured her, that now was the mo|ment
<PB N="67" REF="67">
for fixing her conque&s;t of Mandlebert, by
adroitly di&s;playing to him the admiration &s;he could
not but excite, in the numerous &s;trangers before
whom &s;he would appear; &s;he gave her various in|&s;tructions
how to &s;et off her per&s;on to mo&s;t advan|tage,
and &s;he delighted Sir Hugh with a&s;&s;urances of
what this evening would effect: &startq;There is nothing,
Sir,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;&s;o conducive towards a right un|der&s;tanding
between per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, as a ball. A
gentleman may &s;pend months and months in this
drow&s;y way in the country, and always think one day
will do as well as another for his declaration; but
when he &s;ees a young lady admired and noticed by
others, he falls naturally into making her the &s;ame
compliments, and the affair goes into a regular train,
without his almo&s;t thinking of it.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh li&s;tened to this doctrine with every de|&s;ire
to give it credit; and though the occupations of
the toilette left him alone the whole of the a&s;&s;embly
day, he was as happy in the pro&s;pect of their diver|&s;ion,
as they were them&s;elves in its preparation.</P>
<P>When the young ladies were ready, they repaired
to the apartment of the baronet, to &s;hew them&s;elves,
and to take leave. Edgar and Lionel were waiting
to meet them upon the &s;tairs. Indiana had never
yet looked &s;o lovely; Camilla, with all her attrac|tions,
was eclip&s;ed; and Eugenia could only have
&s;erved as a foil, even to tho&s;e who had no preten&s;ions
to beauty.</P>
<P>Edgar, neverthele&s;s, a&s;ked Camilla to dance with
him; &s;he willingly, though not without wonder, con|&s;ented.
Lionel de&s;ired the hand of his fair cou&s;in;
but Indiana, &s;elf-de&s;tined to Edgar, who&s;e addre&s;s
to Camilla, &s;he had not heard, made him no an&s;wer,
and ran on to pre&s;ent her&s;elf to her uncle; who,
&s;truck with admiration as he beheld her, cried &startq;In|diana,
my dear, you really look prettier than I could
even have gue&s;&s;ed; and yet I always knew there was
no fault to be found with the out&s;ide; nor indeed
with the in&s;ide neither, Mr. Mandlebert, &s;o I don't
mean any thing by that; only, by u&s;e, one is apt to
put the out&s;ide fir&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68">
Lionel was now hurrying them away, when Sir
Hugh calling to Edgar, &s;aid: &startq;Pray, young Mr.
Mandlebert, take as much care of her as po&s;&s;ible;
which I am &s;ure you will do of your own accord.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, an&s;wered, he &s;hould
be happy to take whatever care was in his power of
all the ladies; &startq;but,&endq; added he, &startq;for my own par|ticular
charge to-night, I have engaged Mi&s;s Ca|milla.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And how came you to do that? Don't you
know I let them all go on purpo&s;e for the &s;ake of
your dancing with Indiana, which I mean as a par|ticular
favour?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir,&endq; replied Edgar, a little embarra&s;&s;ed, &startq;you
are very good; but as Lionel cannot dance with his
&s;i&s;ters, he has engaged Mi&s;s Lynmere him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pho, pho, what do you mind Lionel for? not
but what he's a very good lad; only I had rather
have you and Indiana dance together, which I dare
&s;ay &s;o had &s;he.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, &s;omewhat di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, looked at Camilla:
&startq;O, as to me,&endq; cried &s;he, gaily, &startq;pray let me take
my chance; if I &s;hould not dance at all, the whole
will be &s;o new to me, that I am &s;ure of entertain|ment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are the be&s;t good girl, without the &s;malle&s;t
exception,&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh, &startq;that ever I have known
in the world; and &s;o you always were; by which I
mean nothing as to Indiana, who is ju&s;t &s;uch another,
except in &s;ome points; and &s;o here's her hand, young
Mr. Mandlebert, and if you think you &s;hall meet a
prettier partner at the ball, I beg when you get her
there, you will tell her &s;o fairly, and give her up.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, who had hardly yet looked at her, was
now him&s;elf &s;truck with the unu&s;ual re&s;plendence of
her beauty, and telling Camilla he &s;aw &s;he was glad
to be at liberty, prote&s;ted he could not but rejoice
to be &s;pared a deci&s;ion for him&s;elf, where the choice
would have been &s;o difficult.</P>
<P>&startq;Well then, now go,&endq; cried the delighted ba|ronet;
&startq;Lionel will find him&s;elf a partner, I have
<PB N="69" REF="69">
no doubt, becau&s;e he is nothing particular in point
of &s;hyne&s;s; and as to Camilla, &s;he'll want nothing
but to hear the fiddlers to be as merry as a grig,
which what it is I never knew: &s;o I have no con|cern,&endq;
added he, in a low voice, to Edgar, &startq;except
for little Eugenia, and poor Mrs. Margland; for
Eugenia being &s;o plain, which is no fault of her's,
on account of the &s;mall-pox, many a per&s;on may
overlook her from that objection; and as to Mrs.
Margland, being with all the&s;e young chickens, I
am afraid people will think her rather one of the
olde&s;t for a dancing match; which I &s;ay in no di&s;|re&s;pect,
for oldne&s;s gives one no choice.&endq;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">New Characters.</HEAD>
<P>THE dancing was not yet begun, but the com|pany
was met, and the &s;prightly violins were em|ployed
to quicken their motions, when the Cleves
party entered the ball room. They were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
immediately by a large party of officers, who
a&s;&s;ured Lionel, with whom they were acquainted,
that they had impatiently been expected.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall recompen&s;e you for waiting,&endq; an&s;wered
he, in a whi&s;per, &startq;by introducing you to the rich
heire&s;s of Cleves, who now makes her fir&s;t appear|ance
from the nur&s;ery; though no! upon farther
thoughts, I will only tell you &s;he is one of our &s;et,
and leave it to your own ingenuity to find her out.&endq;</P>
<P>While this was pa&s;&s;ing, Indiana, fluttering with
all the &s;ecret triumph of con&s;cious beauty, attended
by Edgar, and guarded by Mi&s;s Margland, walked
up the room, through a crowd of admiring &s;pec|tators;
in whom a new figure, without half her
loveline&s;s, would have excited the &s;ame curio&s;ity, that
her extreme inexperience attributed &s;olely to her pe|culiar
<PB N="70" REF="70">
charms. Camilla and Eugenia followed rather
as if in her train, than of her party; but Lionel
kept entirely with the officers, in&s;i&s;ting upon their
gue&s;&s;ing which was the heire&s;s; to whom, while he
purpo&s;ely mi&s;led their conjectures, he urged them
to make their court, by enumerating the pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Sir Hugh, and her future expectations.</P>
<P>Camilla, however, pa&s;&s;ed not long unnoticed,
though the &s;plendor of Indiana's appearance ca&s;t her
at fir&s;t on the back ground; a circum&s;tance which,
by impre&s;&s;ing her with a &s;en&s;ation of inferiority, di|ve&s;ted
her mind of all per&s;onal con&s;iderations, and
gave to her air and countenance a graceful &s;implicity,
a di&s;engaged openne&s;s, and a guilele&s;s freedom from
affectation, that rendered her, to the ob&s;ervant eye,
as captivating upon examination, as Indiana, from
the fir&s;t glance, was brilliant and alluring. And
thus, as they patroled the room, Indiana excited an
unmixt admiration, Camilla awakened an endle&s;s va|riety
of remark; while each being &s;een for the fir&s;t
time, and every one el&s;e of the company for at lea&s;t
the &s;econd, all attention was their own, whether for
critici&s;m or for prai&s;e. To Indiana this an&s;wered, in
fulfilling her expectations; by Camilla, it was un|heeded,
for, not awaiting, &s;he did not perceive it;
yet both felt equal &s;atisfaction. The eyes of Ca|milla
&s;parkled with delight as &s;he &s;urveyed all around
her the gay novelty of the &s;cene; the heart of In|diana
beat with a plea&s;ure wholly new, as &s;he di&s;|covered
that all &s;urrounding her regarded her as the
principal object.</P>
<P>Eugenia, meanwhile, had not even the negative
felicity to pa&s;s unob&s;erved; impertinent wittici&s;ms
upon her face, per&s;on and walk, though not uttered
&s;o audibly as to be di&s;tinctly heard, ran round the
room in a confu&s;ed murmur, and produced a di&s;|po&s;ition
for &s;neering in the &s;atirical, and for tittering
in the giddy, that made her as valuable an acqui&s;ition
to the company at large, who collect for any amu&s;e|ment,
indifferent to its nature, as her fair cou&s;in
proved to the admirers of beauty, and her &s;i&s;ter to
<PB N="71" REF="71">
the developers of expre&s;&s;ion. She was &s;hielded, how|ever,
her&s;elf, from all unde&s;erved mortifications, by
not &s;u&s;pecting any were meant for her&punc; and by a
mind delightedly pre-occupied with that &s;udden ex|pan&s;ion
of ideas, with which new &s;cenery and new
objects charm a youthful imagination.</P>
<P>When they had taken two or three turns up and
down the room, the &s;aunterers were called upon to
give place to the dancers. Edgar then led out In|diana,
and the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies brought
Major Cerwood to Camilla.</P>
<P>Eugenia, wholly left out, became the exclu&s;ive
charge of Mi&s;s Margland; &s;he felt no re&s;entment of
neglect, for &s;he had formed no &s;pecies of expectation.
She looked on with perfect contentment, and the
motley and quick changing group afforded her ample
entertainment.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland was not &s;o pa&s;&s;ive; &s;he &s;eized the
opportunity of inveighing very angrily again&s;t the
mi&s;management of Sir Hugh: &startq;If you had all,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;been taken to town, and properly brought
out, according to my advice, &s;uch a di&s;grace as this
could never have happened; every body would have
known who you were, and then, thore is no doubt,
you might have had partners enough; however, I
heartily hope you won't be a&s;ked to dance all the
evening, that he may be convinced who was in the
right; be&s;ides, the more you are tired, the more you
may &s;ee, again&s;t another time, Mi&s;s Eugenia, that it
is better to li&s;ten a little to people's opinions, when
they &s;peak only for your own advantage, than to go
on with ju&s;t the &s;ame indifference, as if you had no
proper per&s;on to con&s;ult with.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia was too well amu&s;ed to heed this remon|&s;trance;
and long accu&s;tomed to hear the voice of
Mi&s;s Margland without profit or plea&s;ure, her ear
received its &s;ound, but her attention included not its
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Indiana and Camilla, in this public e&s;&s;ay, ac|quitted
them&s;elves with all the merits, and all the
faults common to a fir&s;t exhibition. The &s;pectators
upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, though never equally ob&s;ervant,
<PB N="72" REF="72">
are never afterwards &s;o lenient. Whatever fails is
attributed to mode&s;ty, more winning than the ut|mo&s;t
&s;ucce&s;s of excellence. Timidity &s;olicits that
mercy which pride is mo&s;t gratified to grant; the
blu&s;hes of juvenile &s;hame atone for the deficiencies
which cau&s;e them; and aukwardne&s;s it&s;elf, in the
unfounded terrors of youth, is perhaps more intere&s;t|ing
than grace.</P>
<P>Indiana could with difficulty keep to the figure of
the dance, from the exulting, yet unpracti&s;ed cer|tainty
of attracting all eyes; and Camilla perpetually
turned wrong, from the mere flutter of fear, which
made her expect &s;he &s;hould never turn right. Major
Cerwood, her partner, with a view to encourage her,
was profu&s;e in his compliments; but, as new to what
&s;he heard as what &s;he performed, &s;he was only the
more confu&s;ed by the double claim to her attention.</P>
<P>Edgar, meanwhile, was mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous to aid his
fair partner. Mi&s;s Margland, though &s;carcely even
&s;uperficial in general knowledge, was conver&s;ant in
the practical detail of the hackneyed mode of form|ing
matrimonial engagements; &s;he judged, therefore,
rightly, that her pupil would be &s;een to mo&s;t advan|tage,
in the di&s;tinction of that adulation by which
new beholders would &s;tamp new value on her charms.
From the time of his fir&s;t boyi&s;h gallantry, on the
ill-fated birth-day of Camilla, Indiana had never &s;o
much &s;truck young Mandlebert, as while he attended
her up the a&s;&s;embly-room. Mi&s;s Margland ob&s;erved
this with triumph, and prophe&s;ied the &s;peedie&s;t con|clu&s;ion
to her long and weary &s;ojourn at Cleves, in
the much wi&s;hed for journey to London, with a bride
ready made, and an e&s;tabli&s;hment ready formed.</P>
<P>When then two fir&s;t dances were over, the gentle|men
were de&s;ired to change partners. Major Cer|wood
a&s;ked the hand of Indiana, and Edgar repaired
to Camilla: &startq;Do you bear malice?&endq; he cried, with
a &s;mile, or may I now make the claim that Sir
Hugh relinqui&s;hed for me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, with alacrity, when in|formed
of the plan of change; &startq;and I wi&s;h there
<PB N="73" REF="73">
was any body el&s;e, that would dance with me after|wards,
in&s;tead of that Major.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I dare believe,&endq; &s;aid he, laughing, &startq;there are
many bodies el&s;e, who would oblige you, if your de|claration
were heard. But what has the Major done
to you? Has he admired you without knowing how
to keep his own coun&s;el?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no; only he has treated me like a country
&s;impleton, and made me as many fine &s;peeches, as
if he had been talking to Indiana.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You think, then, Indiana would have &s;wallowed
flattery with le&s;s difficulty?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, indeed! but I think the &s;ame things &s;aid
to her would no longer have been &s;o extravagant.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, to whom the &s;un-beams of the mind gave
a glow which not all the &s;parkling rays of the brighte&s;t
eyes could emit, re&s;pected her mode&s;ty too highly to
combat it, and dropping the &s;ubject, enquired what
was become of Eugenia.</P>
<P>&startq;O poor Eugenia!&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;I &s;ee nothing
of her, and I am very much afraid &s;he has had no
better partner all this time than Mi&s;s Margland.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, turning round, pre&s;ently di&s;cerned her;
&s;he was &s;till looking on, with an air of the mo&s;t per|fect
compo&s;ure, examining the various parties, to|tally
without &s;u&s;picion of the examination &s;he was
her&s;elf &s;u&s;taining: while Mi&s;s Margland was vainly
pouring in her ears ob&s;ervations, or exhortations,
evidently of a complaining nature.</P>
<P>&startq;There is &s;omething truly re&s;pectable,&endq; &s;aid Ed|gar,
&startq;in the innate philo&s;ophy with which &s;he bears
&s;uch neglect&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yet I wi&s;h it were put le&s;s to the proof;&endq; &s;aid
Camilla. &startq;I would give the world &s;omebody would
take her out!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You don't think &s;he would dance?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes, &s;he would! her lamene&s;s is no impedi|ment;
for &s;he never thinks of it. We all learnt to|gether
at Cleves. Dancing gives her a little more
exertion, and therefore a little more fatigue than
other people, but that is all.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="74">
&startq;After the&s;e two dances then&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Will you be her partner?&endq; interrupted Ca|milla,
&startq;O go to her at once! immediately! and
you will give me twenty times more plea&s;ure than I
can have in dancing my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>She then flew to a form, and eagerly &s;eated her&s;elf
where &s;he perceived the fir&s;t vacancy, to &s;top any
debate, and enforce his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The dance, which had been delayed by a di&s;pute
about the tune, was now beginning. Edgar, looking
after her with affected reproach, but real admiration,
a&s;ked the hand of Eugenia; who gave it with readi|ne&s;s
and plea&s;ure; for, though contented as a &s;pec|tatre&s;s,
&s;he experienced an agreeable &s;urpri&s;e in be|coming
a party engaged.</P>
<P>Camilla, happy in her own good humour, now
looked at her neighbours; one of which was an el|derly
lady, who, wholly employed in examining and
admiring the performance of her own danghters, &s;aw
nothing el&s;e in the room. The other was a gentle|man,
much di&s;tingui&s;hed by his figure and appear|ance,
and dre&s;&s;ed &s;o completely in the extreme of
fa&s;hion, as more than to border upon foppery. The
ca&s;e and negligence of his air denoted a &s;elf-&s;ettled
&s;uperiority to all about him; yet, from time to time,
there was an archne&s;s in the glance of his eye, that
promi&s;ed, under a deep and wilful veil of conceit and
affectation, a &s;ecret di&s;po&s;ition to deride the very
follies he was practi&s;ing. He was now lounging
again&s;t the wain&s;cot; with one hand on his &s;ide,
and the other upon his eye-lids, occupying the &s;pace,
without u&s;ing the &s;eat, to the left of Camilla.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, perceiving what &s;he regarded as
a fair vacancy, made up to the &s;pot, and &s;aying,
&startq;Sir, by your leave,&endq; was preparing to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the place, when the gentleman, as if with|out
&s;eeing her, dropt &s;uddenly into it him&s;elf, and,
pouring a profu&s;ion of <HI>eau &s;uave</HI> upon his handker|chief,
exclaimed: &startq;What a va&s;tly bad room this is
for dancing!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="75">
Camilla, concluding her&s;elf addre&s;&s;ed, turned
round to him; but, &s;eeing he was &s;niffing up the
<HI>eau &s;auve,</HI> without looking at her, imagined he meant
to &s;peak to Mi&s;s Margland.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland was of the &s;ame opinion, and, with
&s;ome pique at his &s;eizing thus her intended &s;eat, ra|ther
&s;harply an&s;wered: &startq;Yes, Sir, and it's a va&s;t
bad room for <HI>not</HI> dancing; for if every body would
dance that ought, there would be accommodation
&s;ufficient for other people.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Incomparably well ob&s;erved!&endq; cried he, col|lecting
&s;ome bonbons from a bonboniere, and &s;wal|lowing
one after another with great rapidity: &startq;But
won't you &s;it down? You mu&s;t be enormou&s;ly tired.
Let me &s;upplicate you to &s;it down.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, &s;uppo&s;ing he meant to make
amends for his inattention, by delivering up the
place, civilly thanked him, and &s;aid &s;he &s;hould not
be &s;orry, for &s;he had &s;tood a good while.</P>
<P>&startq;Have you, indeed?&endq; cried he, &s;prinkling &s;ome
je&s;&s;amine drops upon his hands; &startq;how horribly abo|minable?
Why don't &s;ome of tho&s;e Mercuries, tho&s;e
Ganymedes, tho&s;e waiters, I believe you call them,
get you a chair?&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, exce&s;&s;ively affronted, turned her
back to him; and Camilla made an offer of her own
&s;eat; but, as &s;he had been dancing, and would pro|bably
dance again, Mi&s;s Margland would not let her
ri&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;Shall I call to one of tho&s;e Barbarians, tho&s;e
Goths, tho&s;e Vandals?&endq; cried the &s;ame gentleman,
who now was &s;pirting lavender water all about him,
with grimaces that proclaimed forcibly his opinion of
the want of perfume in the room: &startq;Do pray let
me harangue them a little for you upon their inor|dinate
want of &s;en&s;ibility.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland deigned not any an&s;wer; but of
that he took no notice, and pre&s;ently called out,
though without rai&s;ing his voice, &startq;Here, Mr.
Waiter! Purveyor, Surveyor, or what&s;oever other
title `<HI>plea&s;e thine car,</HI>' art thou deaf? why do&s;t not
<PB N="76" REF="76">
bring this lady a chair? Tho&s;e people are mo&s;t
amazing hard of hearing! Shall I call again? Waiter,
I &s;ay!&endq; &s;till &s;peaking rather lower than louder;
&startq;Don't I &s;tun you by this &s;hocking vociferation?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir, you're va&s;tly&mdash;obliging!&endq; cried Mi&s;s Mar|gland,
unable longer to hold &s;ilence, yet with a look
and manner that would much better have accorded
with va&s;tly&mdash;<HI>impertinent.</HI></P>
<P>She then pur&s;ued a waiter her&s;elf, and procured a
thair.</P>
<P>Ca&s;ting his eyes next upon Camilla, he examined
her with much attention. Aba&s;hed, &s;he turned away
her head: but not choo&s;ing to lo&s;e his object, he
called it back again, by &s;amiliarly &s;aying, &startq;How
is Sir Hugh?&endq;</P>
<P>A good deal &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;he exclaimed, &startq;Do you
know my uncle, Sir?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not in the lea&s;t, ma'am,&endq; he coolly an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Camilla, much wondering, was then &s;orced into
conver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Margland: but, without
paying any regard to her &s;urpri&s;e, he pre&s;ently &s;aid,
&startq;It's mo&s;t extremely worth your while to take a
glance at that inimitably good figure. Is it not ex|qui&s;ite?&endq;
Can you &s;uppo&s;e any thing beyond it?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, looking at the per&s;on to whom he pointed,
and who was &s;ufficiently ludicrous, from an air of
vulgar &s;olemnity, and a dre&s;s &s;tiffly new, though
completely old-fa&s;hioned, felt di&s;po&s;ed to join in his
laugh, had &s;he not been di&s;concerted by the mingled
liberty and oddity of his attack.</P>
<P>&startq;Sir,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, winking at her to
be &s;ilent, though eager to an&s;wer in her &s;tead, &startq;the
mixt company one always meets at the&s;e public balls,
makes them very unfit for ladies of fa&s;hion, for there's
no knowing who one may either dance with or &s;peak
to.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Va&s;tly true, ma'am,&endq; cried he, &s;uperciliou&s;ly
dropping his eyes, not to look at her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, perceiving this, bridled re&s;ent|fully,
and again talked on with Camilla; till another
exc$$ation interrupted them. &startq;O pray,&endq; cried
<PB N="77" REF="77">
he, &startq;I do intreat you look at that group! Is it not
pa&s;t compare? If ever you held a pencil in your life,
I beg and be&s;eech you to take a memorandum of
that tall may-pole. Have you ever &s;een any thing &s;o
exce&s;&s;ively delectable?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla could not forbear &s;miling; but Mi&s;s
Margland, taking all reply upon her&s;elf, &s;aid:
&startq;Cari$a$ures, Sir, are by no means plea&s;ing for young
ladies to be taking, at their fir&s;t coming out: one
does not know who may be next, if once they get
into that habit!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Immea&s;urably well &s;poken, ma'am,&endq; returned he;
and, ri&s;ing with a look of di&s;gu&s;t, he &s;auntered to
another part of the room.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, extremely provoked, &s;aid &s;he was
&s;ure he was &s;ome Iri&s;h fortune hunter, dre&s;&s;ed out in
all he was worth; and charged Camilla to take no
manner of notice of him.</P>
<P>When the two &s;econd dances were over, Edgar,
conducting Eugenia to Mi&s;s Margland, &s;aid to Ca|milla:
&startq;Now, at lea&s;t, if there is not a &s;pell again&s;t
it, will you dance with me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And if there is one, too,&endq; cried &s;he, gaily&punc;
&startq;for I am perfectly di&s;po&s;ed to help breaking it.&endq;</P>
<P>She ro&s;e, and they were again going to take their
places, when Mi&s;s Margland, reproachfully calling
after Edgar, demanded what he had done with Mi&s;s
Lynmere?</P>
<P>At the &s;ame moment, led by Major Cerwood, who
was paying her in full all the arrears of that gallantry
Mi&s;s Margland had taught her to regret hitherto
mi&s;&s;ing, Indiana joined them; the Major, in making
his bow, lamenting the rules of the a&s;&s;embly, that
compelled him to relinqui&s;h her hand.</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Mandlebert,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;you
&s;ee Mi&s;s Lynmere is again di&s;engaged.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, ma'am,&endq; an&s;wered Edgar, drawing Ca|milla
away; &startq;and every gentleman in the room will
be happy to &s;ee it too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Stop, Mi&s;s Camilla!&endq; cried Mi&s;s Margland;
&startq;I thought, Mr. Mandlebert, Sir Hugh had put
Mi&s;s Lynmere under your protection?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="78">
&startq;O it does not &s;ignify!&endq; &s;aid Indiana, colouring
high with a new rai&s;ed &s;en&s;e of importance; &startq;I don't
at all doubt but one or other of the officers will take
care of me.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, though &s;omewhat di&s;concerted, would &s;till
have proceeded; but Camilla, alarmed by the frowns
of Mi&s;s Margland, begged him to lead out her coufin,
and, promi&s;ing to be in readine&s;s for the next two
dances, glided back to her &s;eat. He upbraided her
in vain; Mi&s;s Margland looked plea&s;ed, and Indiana
was &s;o much p$qued, that he found it nece&s;&s;ary to di|rect
all his attention to appea&s;ing her, as he led her
to join the dance.</P>
<P>A gentleman now, eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by per|&s;onal
beauty&punc; approached the ladies that remained,
and, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, began conver&s;ing
with Mi&s;s Margland; who received his attentions &s;o
gratefully, that, when he told her he only waited to
&s;ee the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies at lei&s;ure, in order
to have the honour of begging the hand of one of
her young ladies, his civilities &s;o conquered all her
pride of etiquette, that &s;he a&s;&s;ured him there was no
&s;ort of occa&s;ion for &s;uch a formality, with a per&s;on
of his appearance and manners; and was bidding
Camilla ri&s;e, who was innocently preparing to obey&punc;
when, to the &s;urpri&s;e of them all, he addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf
to Eugenia.</P>
<P>&startq;There!&endq; cried Mi&s;s Margland, exultingly, when
they were gone; &startq;that gentleman is completely a
gentleman. I &s;aw it from the beginning. How dif|ferent
that impertinent fop that &s;poke to us ju&s;t now!
He has the politene&s;s to take out Mi&s;s Eugenia, be|cau&s;e
he &s;ees plainly nobody el&s;e will think of it, ex|cept
ju&s;t Mr. Mandlebert, or &s;ome &s;uch old acquaint|ance.&endq;</P>
<P>Major Cerwood was now advancing towards Ca|milla,
with that &s;pecies of &s;miling and bowing man|ner,
which is the u&s;ual precur&s;or of an invitation to
a fair partner; when the gentleman whom Mi&s;s
Margland had ju&s;t called an impertinent fop, with a
&s;udden &s;wing, not to be eluded, ca&s;t him&s;elf between
<PB N="79" REF="79">
the Major and Camilla, as if he had not ob&s;erved his
approach; and &s;poke to her in a voice &s;o low, that,
though &s;he concluded he a&s;ked her to dance, &s;he
could not di&s;tinctly hear a word he &s;aid.</P>
<P>A good deal confu&s;ed, &s;he looked at him for an
explanation; while the Major, from her air of at|tention,
&s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf too late, retreated.</P>
<P>Her new beau then, carele&s;sly &s;eating him&s;elf by
her &s;ide, indolently &s;aid: &startq;What a heat! I have not
the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea how you can bear it!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla found it impo&s;&s;ible to keep her counte|nance
at &s;uch a re&s;ult of a whi&s;per, though &s;he com|plied
with the injunctions of Mi&s;s Margland, in
avoiding mutual di&s;cour&s;e with a &s;tranger of &s;o &s;howy
an appearance.</P>
<P>&startq;Yet they are dancing on,&endq; he continued, &startq;ju&s;t
as if the Greenland &s;nows were inviting their exer|ci&s;e!
I &s;hould really like to find out what tho&s;e
people are made of. Can you po&s;&s;ibly imagine their
compo&s;ition?&endq;</P>
<P>Heedle&s;s of receiving no an&s;wer, he &s;oon after
added: &startq;I am va&s;tly glad you don't like dancing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me?&endq; cried Camilla, &s;urpri&s;ed out of her
caution.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes; you hold it in antipathy, don't you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, indeed! far from it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Don't you really?&endq; cried he, &s;tarting back;
&startq;that's amazingly extraordinary! &s;urpri&s;ing in the
extreme! Will you have the goodne&s;s to tell me
what you like in it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir,&endq; interfered Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;there's no|thing
but what's very natural in a young lady's tak|ing
plea&s;ure in an elegant accompli&s;hment; provided
&s;he is &s;ecure from any improper partner, or com|pany.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Irrefragably ju&s;t, ma'am!&endq; an&s;wered he; af|fecting
to take a pinch of &s;nuff, and turning his
head another way.</P>
<P>Here Lionel, ha&s;tily running up to Camilla, whi&s;|pered,
&startq;I have made a &s;ine confu&s;ion among the
red-coats about the heire&s;s of Cleves! I have put
them all upon different &s;cents.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="80">
He was then going back, when a faint laugh from
the neighbour of Camilla detained him; &startq;Look, I
adjure you,&endq; cried he, addre&s;&s;ing her, &startq;if there's
not that delightful creature again, with his bran-new
clothes? and they &s;it upon him &s;o tight, he can't
turn round his va&s;tly droll figure, except like a puppet
with one jerk for the whole body. He is really an
immen&s;e treat: I &s;hould like, of all things in nature,
to know who he can be.&endq;</P>
<P>A waiter then pa&s;&s;ing with a gla&s;s of water for a
lady, he &s;topped him in his way, exclaiming: &startq;Pray,
my extremely good friend, can you tell me who that
agreeable per&s;on is, that &s;tands there, with the air
of a poker?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Sir,&endq; an&s;wered the man; &startq;I know him
very well. His name is Dub&s;ter. He's quite a
gentleman to my knowledge, and has very good for|tunes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Camilla,&endq; cried Lionel, &startq;will you have him for
a partner?&endq; And, immediately ha&s;tening up to him,
he &s;aid two or three words in a low voice, and &s;kipped
back to the dance.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter then walked up to her, and, with an
air con&s;picuou&s;ly aukward, &s;olemnly &s;aid, &startq;So you
want to dance, ma'am?&endq;</P>
<P>Convinced he had been &s;ent to her by Lionel, but
by no means chu&s;ing to di&s;play her&s;elf with a figure
di&s;tingui&s;hed only as a mark for ridicule; &s;he looked
down to conceal her ever-ready &s;miles, and &s;aid &s;he
had been dancing &s;ome time.</P>
<P>&startq;But if you like to dance again, ma'am,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;I am very ready to oblige you.&endq;</P>
<P>She now &s;aw that this offer had been reque&s;ted as
a favour; and, while half provoked, half diverted,
grew embarra&s;&s;ed how to get rid of him, without in|volving
a nece&s;&s;ity to refu&s;e afterwards Edgar, and
every other; for Mi&s;s Margland had informed her of
the general rules upon the&s;e occa&s;ions. She looked,
therefore, at that lady for coun&s;el; while her neigh|bour,
&s;ticking his hands in his &s;ides, &s;urveyed him
from head to foot, with an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch un|di&s;gui&s;ed
<PB N="81" REF="81">
amu&s;ement, that Mr. Dub&s;ter, who could
not help ob&s;erving it, ca&s;t towards him, from time
to time, a look of the mo&s;t angry &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland approving, as well under&s;tanding
the appeal, now authoritatively interfered, &s;aying:
&startq;Sir, I &s;uppo&s;e you know the etiquette in public
places?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The what, ma'am?&endq; cried he, &s;taring.</P>
<P>&startq;You know, I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, that no young lady
of any con&s;ideration dances with a gentleman that is
a &s;tranger to her, without he's brought to her by the
ma&s;ter of the ceremonies?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O as to that, ma'am, I have no objection. I'll
go &s;ee for him, if you've a mind. It makes no dif|ference
to me.&endq;</P>
<P>And away he went.</P>
<P>&startq;So you really intend dancing with him?&endq; cried
Camilla's neighbour. &startq;'Twill be a va&s;tly good &s;ight.
I have not the mo&s;t remo$e conception how he will
bear the pulling and jo&s;tling about. Bend he cannot;
but I am immen&s;ely afraid he will break. I would
give fifty guineas for his portrait. He is indubitably
put together without joints.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter now returned, and, with a look of
&s;ome di&s;turbance, &s;aid to Mi&s;s Margland: &startq;Ma'am,
I don't know which is the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.
I can't find him out; for I don't know as ever I &s;ee
him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O pray,&endq; cried Camilla eagerly, &startq;do not take
the trouble of looking for him; 'twill an&s;wer no
purpo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why I think &s;o too, ma'am,&endq; &s;aid he, mi&s;un|der&s;tanding
her; &startq;for as I don't know the gentle|man
my&s;elf, he could go no great way towards mak|ing
us better acquainted with one another: &s;o we
may ju&s;t as well take our &s;kip at once.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now looked extremely fooli&s;h; and Mi&s;s
Margland was again preparing an ob&s;tacle, when
Mr. Dub&s;ter &s;tarted one him&s;elf. &startq;The wor&s;t is,&endq;
cried he, &startq;I have lo&s;t one of my gloves, and I am
&s;ure I had two when I came. I &s;uppo&s;e I may
<PB N="82" REF="82">
have dropt it in the other room. If you &s;han't
mind it, I'll dance without it; for I don't mind
tho&s;e things my&s;elf of a &s;traw.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! Sir,&endq; cried Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;that's &s;uch a
thing as never was heard of. I can't po&s;&s;ibly con&s;ent
to let Mi&s;s Camilla dance in &s;uch a manner as that.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why then, if you like it better, ma'am, I'll
go back and look for it.&endq;</P>
<P>Again Camilla would have declined giving him
any trouble; but he &s;eemed per&s;uaded it was only
from &s;hyne&s;s, and would not li&s;ten. &startq;Though the
wor&s;t is,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;you're lo&s;ing &s;o much time.
However, I'll give a good hunt; unle&s;s, indeed, that
gentleman, who is doing nothing him&s;elf, except
looking on at us all, would be kind enough to lend
me his.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I rather fancy, Sir,&endq; cried the gentleman, im|mediately
recovering from a laughing fit, and &s;ur|veying
the reque&s;ter with &s;upercilious contempt; &startq;I
rather &s;u&s;pect they would not perfectly fit you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why then,&endq; cried he, &startq;I think I'll go and
a&s;k Tom Hicks to lend me a pair; for it's a pity to
let the young lady lo&s;e her dance for &s;uch a &s;mall
trifle as that.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla began remon&s;trating; but he tranquilly
walked away.</P>
<P>&startq;You are &s;uperlatively in the good graces of for|tune
to-night,&endq; cried her new friend, &startq;&s;uperlatively
to a degree: you may not meet with &s;uch an inva|luably
uncommon object in twenty lu&s;tres.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Certainly,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;there's a
great want of regulation at balls, to prevent low
people from a&s;l$ing who they will to dance with them.
It's bad enough one can't keep people one knows
nothing of from &s;peaking to one.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Admirably hit off! admirable in the extreme!&endq;
he an&s;wered; &s;uddenly twi&s;ting him&s;elf round, and
beginning a whi&s;pering conver&s;ation with a gentle|man
on his other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter &s;oon came again, &s;aying, &s;omewhat
dolorou&s;ly, &startq;I have looked high and low for my
<PB N="83" REF="83">
glove, but I am no nearer. I dare &s;ay &s;omebody
has picked it up, out of a joke, and put it in their
pocket. And as to Tom Hicks, where he can be
hid, I can't tell, unle&s;s he has hanged him&s;elf; for
I can't find him no more than my glove. However
I've got a boy to go and get me a pair; if all the
&s;hops a'n't &s;hut up.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, fearing to be involved in a nece&s;&s;ity of
dancing with him, expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf very &s;orry for
this &s;tep; but, again mi&s;conceiving her motive, he
begged her not to mind it; &s;aying, &startq;A pair of
gloves here or there is no great matter. All I am
concerned for is, putting you off &s;o long from hav|ing
a little plea&s;ure, for I dare &s;ay the boy won't
come till the next two batches; &s;o if that gentleman
that looks &s;o particular at me has a mind to jig it
with you a bit him&s;elf, in the interim, I won't be
his hindrance.&endq;</P>
<P>Receiving no an&s;wer, he bent his head lower down,
and &s;aid, in a louder voice, &startq;Pray, Sir, did you
hear me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir, you are ineffably good!&endq; was the reply;
without a look, or any further notice.</P>
<P>Much affronted, he &s;aid no more, but &s;tood pout|ing
and &s;tiff before Camilla, till the &s;econd dance
was over, and another general &s;eparation of partners
took place. &startq;I thought how it would be, ma'am,&endq;
he then cried; &startq;for I know it's no &s;uch ea&s;y matter
to find &s;hops open at this time of night; for if peo|ple's
'prentices can't take a little plea&s;ure by now,
they can't never.&endq;</P>
<P>Tea being at this time ordered, the whole party
collected to remove to the next room. Lionel, &s;ee|ing
Mr. Dub&s;ter &s;tanding by Camilla, with a rap|turous
laugh, cried, &startq;Well, &s;i&s;ter, have you been
dancing?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, though laughing too, reproachfully &s;hook
her head at him; while Mr. Dub&s;ter gravely &s;aid,
&startq;It's no fault of mine, Sir, that the lady's a &s;itting
&s;till; for I come and offered my&s;elf to her the mo|ment
you told me &s;he wanted a partner; but I hap|pened
<PB N="84" REF="84">
of the misfortune of lo&s;ing one of my gloves,
and not being able to find Tom Hicks, I've been
waiting all this while for a boy as has promi&s;ed to get
me a pair; though, I &s;uppo&s;e he's fell down in the
dark and broke his &s;kull, by his not coming. And,
indeed, if that elderly lady had not been &s;o particu|lar,
I might as well have done without; for, if I
had one on, nobody would have been the wi&s;er but
that t'other might have been in my pocket.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;peech, &s;poken without any ceremony in the
hearing of Mi&s;s Margland, to the vi&s;ible and undi&s;|gui&s;ed
delight of Lionel, &s;o much enraged her, that,
ha&s;tily calling him a&s;ide, &s;he peremptorily demanded
how he came to bring &s;uch a vulgar partner to his
&s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e you took no care to get her a better,&endq;
he an&s;wered, heedle&s;sly.</P>
<P>Camilla al&s;o began to remon&s;trate; but, without
hearing her, he courteou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mr.
Dub&s;ter, and told him he was &s;ure Mi&s;s Margland
and his &s;i&s;ter would expect the plea&s;ure of his com|pany
to join their party at tea.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland frowned in vain; Mr. Dub&s;ter
bowed, as at a compliment but his due; ob&s;erving
he &s;hould then be clo&s;e at hand for his partner; and
they were proceeding to the tea-room, when the
finer new acquaintance of Camilla called after Mr.
Dub&s;ter: &startq;Pray, my good Sir, who may this
Signor Thoma&s;o be, that has the honour to &s;tand &s;o
high in your good graces?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mine, Sir?&endq; cried Mr. Dub&s;ter; &startq;I know no
Signor Thoma&s;o, nor Signor nothing el&s;e neither:
&s;o I don't know what you mean.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Did not I hear you dilating, my very good Sir,
upon a certain Mr. Tom &s;omebody?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What, I &s;uppo&s;e then, Sir, if the truth be
known, you would &s;ay Tom Hicks?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;very probably, Sir; though I am not of the
fir&s;t accuracy as the gentleman's nomenclator.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What? don't you know him, Sir? why he's
the head waiter!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="85">
Then, following the re&s;t of the party, he was
placed, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lionel, next to Camilla,
in utter defiance of all the angry glances of Mi&s;s
Margland, who her&s;elf invited the hand&s;ome partner
of Eugenia to join their group, and reaped &s;ome
con&s;olation in his willing civilities; till the attention
of the whole a&s;&s;embly was called, or rather com|manded
by a new object.</P>
<P>A lady, not young, but &s;till hand&s;ome, with an
air of fa&s;hion ea&s;y almo&s;t to in&s;olence, in a complete
but becoming undre&s;s, with a work-bag hanging on
her arm, whence &s;he was carele&s;sly knotting, en|tered
the ball-room alone, and, walking &s;traight
through it to the large folding gla&s;s doors of the
tea-room, there &s;topt, and took a general &s;urvey of
the company, with a look that announced a decided
&s;uperiority to all &s;he &s;aw, and a perfect indifference
to what opinion &s;he incurred in return.</P>
<P>She was immediately joined by all the officers,
and &s;everal other gentlemen, who&s;e eagerne&s;s to &s;hew
them&s;elves of her acquaintance marked her for a
woman of &s;ome con&s;equence; though &s;he took little
other notice of them, than that of giving to each
&s;ome frivolous commi&s;&s;ion; telling one to hold her
work-bag; bidding another fetch her a chair; a
third, a&s;k for a gla&s;s of water; and a fourth, take
care of her cloak. She then planted her&s;elf ju&s;t
without the folding-doors, declaring there could be
no breathing in the &s;maller apartment, and &s;ent about
the gentlemen for various refre&s;hments; all which
&s;he rejected when they arrived, with extreme contempt,
and a thou&s;and fanta&s;tic grimaces.</P>
<P>The tea-table at which Mi&s;s Margland pre&s;ided
being neare&s;t to the&s;e folding doors, &s;he and her party
heard, from time to time, mo&s;t of what was &s;aid,
e&s;pecially by the newly arrived lady; who, though
&s;he now and then &s;poke for &s;everal minutes in a
laughing whi&s;per, to &s;ome one &s;he called to her &s;ide,
uttered mo&s;t of her remarks, and all her commands
quite aloud, with that &s;ort of deliberate ea&s;e which
belongs to the mo&s;t determined negligence of who
<PB N="86" REF="86">
heard, or who e&s;caped hearing her, who were plea&s;ed
or who were offended.</P>
<P>Camilla and Eugenia were &s;oon wholly engro&s;&s;ed
by this new per&s;onage; and Lionel, &s;eeing her &s;ur|rounded
by the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable men of the a&s;&s;embly,
forgot Mr. Dub&s;ter and his gloves, in an eagerne&s;s
to be introduced to her.</P>
<P>Colonel Andover, to whom he applied, willingly
gratified him: &startq;Give me leave, Mrs. Arlbery,&endq;
cried he, to the lady, who was then conver&s;ing with
General Kin&s;ale, &startq;to pre&s;ent to you Mr. Tyrold.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For Heaven's &s;ake, don't &s;peak to me ju&s;t now,&endq;
cried &s;he; &startq;the General is telling me the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting
thing in the world. Go on, dear General!&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel, who, if guided by his own natural judg|ment,
would have conceived this to be the height of
ill-breeding or of ignorance, no &s;ooner &s;aw Colonel
Andover bow in &s;miling &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her orders,
than he concluded him&s;elf all in the dark with re&s;pect
to the la&s;t licences of fa&s;hion: and, while content|edly
he waited her lei&s;ure for his reception, he ran
over in his own mind the triumph with which he
&s;hould carry to Oxford the newe&s;t flouri&s;h of the
<HI>bon ten.</HI></P>
<P>In a few minutes, after gaily laughing with the
General, &s;he turned &s;uddenly to Colonel Andover,
and, &s;triking him on the arm with her fan, ex|claimed:
&startq;Well, now, Colonel, what is it you
would &s;ay?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Tyrold,&endq; he an&s;wered, &startq;is very ambitious
of the honour of being introduced to you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With all my heart. Which is he?&endq; And then,
nodding to Lionel's bow, &startq;You live, I think,&endq; &s;he
added, &startq;in this neighbourhood? By the way, Co|lonel,
how came you never to bring Mr. Tyrold to
me before? Mr. Tyrold, I flatter my&s;elf you intend
to take this very ill.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel was beginning to expre&s;s his &s;en&s;e of the
lo&s;s he had &s;uffered by the delay, when, again,
patting the Colonel, &startq;Only look, I beg you,&endq; &s;he
cried, &startq;at that in&s;upportable Sir Sedley Clarendel!
<PB N="87" REF="87">
how he &s;its at his ea&s;e there! amu&s;ing his ridiculous
fancy with every creature he &s;ees. Yet what an ele|gant
po&s;ture the animal has found out! I make no
doubt he would as &s;oon forfeit his e&s;tate as give up
that attitude. I mu&s;t make him come to me imme|diately
for that very rea&s;on;&mdash;do go to him, good
Andover, and &s;ay I want him directly.&endq;</P>
<P>The Colonel obeyed; but not &s;o the gentleman he
addre&s;&s;ed, who was the new acquaintance of Camilla.
He only bowed to the me&s;&s;age, and, ki&s;&s;ing his hand
acro&s;s the room to the lady, de&s;ired the Colonel to
tell her he was ine&s;$ably tired; but would inconte&s;t|ably
have the honour to throw him&s;elf at her feet the
next morning.</P>
<P>&startq;O, intolerable!&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;he grows more
conceited every hour. Yet what an agreeable wretch
it is! There's nothing like him. I cannot po&s;&s;ibly
do without him. Andover, tell him if he does not
come this moment he kills me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And is that a me&s;&s;age,&endq; &s;aid General Kin&s;ale,
&startq;to cure him of being conceited?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, Heaven forbid, my good General, I &s;hould
cure him! That would utterly &s;poil him. His con|ceit
is preci&s;ely what enchants me. Rob him of
that, and you lo&s;e all hold of him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is it then nece&s;&s;ary to keep him a fop, in order
to retain him in your chains?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, he is not in my chains, I promi&s;e you. A
&s;op, my dear General, wears no chains but his own.
However, I like to have him, becau&s;e he is &s;o hard
to be got; and I am fond of conver&s;ing with him,
becau&s;e he is &s;o ridiculous. Fetch him, therefore,
Colonel, without delay.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;econd emba&s;&s;y prevailed; he &s;hrugged his
&s;houlders, but aro&s;e to follow the Colonel.</P>
<P>&startq;See, madam, your victory!&endq; &s;aid the General.
&startq;What would not a military man give for &s;uch talents
of command?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ay, but look with what magnificent tardine&s;s
he obeys orders! There is &s;omething quite irre&s;i&s;tible
in his impertinence; 'tis &s;o con&s;cious and &s;o picquant.
I think, General, 'tis a little like my own.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="88">
Sir Sedley now advancing, &s;eized the back of a
chair, which he twirled round for a re&s;ting place t$
his elbow, and exclaimed, &startq;You know your&s;elf in|vincible!&endq;
with an air that &s;hewed him languidly
prepared for her reproaches: but, to his own &s;ur|pri&s;e,
and that of all around him, &s;he only, with a
&s;mile and a nod, cried, &startq;How do do?&endq; and imme|diately
turning wholly away from him, addre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf
to Colonel Andover, de&s;iring him to give her
the hi&s;tory of who was in the tea-room.</P>
<P>At this time a young En&s;ign, who had been en|gaged
at a late dinner in the neighbourhood, &s;troamed
into the ball-room, with the mo&s;t vi&s;ible marks of
his unfitne&s;s for appearing in it; and, in total igno|rance
of his own condition, went up to Colonel An|dover,
and, clapping him upon the back, called out,
with a loud oath, &startq;Colonel, I hope you have taken
care to &s;ecure to me the prettie&s;t little young angel
in the room? You know with what &s;incerity I de&s;pi&s;e
an old hag.&endq;</P>
<P>The Colonel, with &s;ome concern, advi&s;ed him to
retire; but, in&s;en&s;ible to his coun&s;el, he uttered oath
upon oath, and added, &startq;I'm not to be played upon,
Colonel. Beauty in a pretty girl is as nece&s;&s;ary an
ingredient, as honour in a brave &s;oldier; and I could
find in my heart to &s;ink down to the bottom of the
Channel every fellow without one, and every dear
creature without the other.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, in de&s;iance of all remon&s;trance, he &s;tag|gered
into the tea-room: and, after a &s;hort &s;urvey,
&s;topt oppo&s;ite to Indiana, and, &s;wearing aloud &s;he
was the hand&s;ome&s;t angel he had ever beheld, begged
her hand without further ceremony; a&s;&s;uring her he
had broken up the be&s;t party that had yet been made
for him in the county, merely for the joy of dancing
with her.</P>
<P>Indiana, to whom not the &s;malle&s;t doubt of the
truth of this a&s;&s;ertion occurred; and who, not &s;u&s;|pecting
he was intoxicated, thought his manner the
mo&s;t &s;pirited and gallant &s;he had ever &s;een, was
readily accepting his offer: when Edgar, who &s;aw
<PB N="89" REF="89">
her danger, &s;tarted up, and exclaimed: &startq;This lady,
Sir, is engaged to dance the next two dances with
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The lady did not tell me &s;o, Sir!&endq; cried the
En&s;ign, firing.</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;s Lynmere,&endq; replied Edgar, coolly, &startq;will
pardon me, that on this occa&s;ion, my memory has
an intere&s;t to be better than her's. I believe it is
time for us to take our places.&endq;</P>
<P>He then whi&s;pered a brief excu&s;e to Camilla, and
hurried Indiana to the ball-room.</P>
<P>The En&s;ign, who knew not that &s;he had danced
with him the la&s;t time, was obliged to &s;ubmit;
while Indiana, not conjecturing the motive that now
impelled Edgar, was in a yet brighter blaze of beauty,
from an exhilarating notion that there was a conte&s;t
for the honour of her hand.</P>
<P>Camilla, once more di&s;appointed of Edgar, had
now no re&s;ource again&s;t Mr. Dub&s;ter, but the non|arrival
of the gloves; for he had talked &s;o publicly
of waiting for them to dance with her, that every
one regarded her as engaged.</P>
<P>No new propo&s;ition being made for Eugenia, Mi&s;s
Margland permitted her again to be led out by the
hand&s;ome &s;tranger.</P>
<P>When &s;he was gone, Mr. Dub&s;ter, who kept con|&s;tantly
clo&s;e to Camilla, &s;aid: &startq;They tell me,
ma'am, that ugly little body's a great fortune.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla very innocently a&s;ked who he meant.</P>
<P>&startq;Why that little lame thing, that was here drink|ing
tea with you. Tom Hicks &s;ays &s;he'll have a
power of money.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter was de&s;ervedly dear to her,
looked much di&s;plea&s;ed; but Mr. Dub&s;ter, not per|ceiving
it, continued: &startq;He recommended it to me
to dance with her my&s;elf, from the fir&s;t, upon that
account. But I &s;ays to him, &s;ays I, I had no notion
that a per&s;on, who had &s;uch a hobble in their gate,
would think of &s;uch a thing as going to dancing.
But there I was out, for as to the women, a&s;king
your pardon, ma'am, there's nothing will put 'em off
<PB N="90" REF="90">
from their plea&s;ure. But, however, for my part, I
had no thought of dancing at all, if it had not been
for that young gentleman's a&s;king me; for I'm not
over fond of &s;uch jiggets, as they've no great u&s;e in
'em; only I happened to be this way, upon a little
matter of bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o I thought I might as well come
and &s;ee the hop, as Tom Hicks could contrive to get
me a ticket.&endq;</P>
<P>This was the &s;ort of di&s;cour&s;e with which Camilla
was regaled till the two dances were over; and then,
begging her to &s;it &s;till till he came back, he quitted
her, to &s;ee what he could do about his gloves.</P>
<P>Edgar, when he returned with Indiana, addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf privately to Mi&s;s Margland, whom he ad|vi&s;ed
to take the yonng ladies immediately home; as
it would not be po&s;&s;ible for him, a &s;econd time, to
break through the rules of the a&s;&s;embly, and Indiana
mu&s;t, therefore, inevitably accept the young En&s;ign,
who already was following and claiming her, and
who&s;e condition was obviou&s;ly improper for the &s;o|ciety
of ladies.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, extremely plea&s;ed with him, for
thus protecting her pupil, in&s;tantly agreed; and,
collecting her three young charges, ha&s;tened them
down &s;tairs; though the young En&s;ign, inflamed
with angry di&s;appointment, uttered the mo&s;t bitter
lamentations at their &s;udden departure; and though
Mr. Dub&s;ter, pur&s;uing them to the coach door, called
out to Camilla, in a tone of pique and vexation,
&startq;Why, what are you going for now, ma'am, when
I have ju&s;t got a new pair of gloves, that I have
bought o' purpo&s;e?&endq;</P>

<P>IN their way home, Edgar apologi&s;ed to Camilla
for again foregoing the promi&s;ed plea&s;ure of dancing
with her, by explaining the &s;ituation of the En&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="91">
Camilla, internally per&s;uaded that any rea&s;on would
&s;uffice for &s;uch an arrangement, where Indiana was
its object, &s;carce li&s;tened to an excu&s;e which &s;he
con&s;idered as unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Indiana was eager to view in the gla&s;s how her
dre&s;s and ornaments had borne the &s;haking of the
dance, and curiou&s;ly impatient to look anew at a
face and a figure of which no &s;elf-vanity, nor even
the adulation of Mi&s;s Margland, had taught her a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uch as &s;he had acquired from the ad|ventures
of this night. She ha&s;tened, therefore, to
her apartment as &s;oon as &s;he arrived at Cleves, and
there indulged in an examination which forbade all
&s;urpri&s;e, and commanded equal ju&s;tice for the ad|mirers
and the admired.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, anxious to make her own report
to Sir Hugh, accompanied Camilla and Eugenia to
his room, where he was &s;till &s;itting up for them.</P>
<P>She expatiated upon the behaviour of young Man|dlebert,
in terms that filled the baronet with &s;ati&s;|faction.
She exulted in the &s;ucce&s;s of her own mea|&s;ures;
and, &s;inking the circum&s;tance of the intended
impartiality of Edgar, enlarged upon his dancing,
out of his turn, with Indiana, as at an event which
manife&s;ted his &s;erious de&s;igns beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of
mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, in the fulne&s;s of his content, promi&s;ed
that when the wedding day arrived, they &s;hould all
have as fine new gowns as the bride her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The next morning, not con&s;idering that every one
el&s;e would require unu&s;ual repo&s;e, he got up before
his cu&s;tomary hour, from an involuntary hope of ac|celerating
his favourite project; but he had long the
breakfa&s;t parlour to him&s;elf, and became &s;o fatigued
and di&s;comfited by fa&s;ting and waiting, that when
Indiana, who appeared la&s;t, but for whom he in&s;i&s;ted
upon &s;taying, entered the room, he &s;aid: &startq;My
dear, I could really find a plea&s;ure in giving you a
little &s;cold, if it were not for &s;etting a bad example,
which God forbid! And, indeed, it's not &s;o much
your fault as the ball's, to which I can never be a
<PB N="92" REF="92">
&s;incere friend, unle&s;s it be ju&s;t to an&s;wer &s;ome par|ticular
purpo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland defended her pupil, and called upon
Mandlebert for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he readily gave. Sir
Hugh then was not merely appea&s;ed but gratified,
and declared, the next moment, with a marked &s;mile
at Indiana, that his breakfa&s;t had not reli&s;hed &s;o well
for a twelvemonth, owing to the advantage of not
beginning till he had got an appetite.</P>
<P>Soon after, Lionel, galloping acro&s;s the park,
ha&s;tily di&s;mounted, and &s;campered into the parlour.</P>
<P>The zealot for every &s;pecies of &s;port, the candidate
for every order of whim, was the light-hearted
mirthful Lionel. A &s;tranger to reflection, and in|capable
of care, laughter &s;eemed not merely the
bent of his humour, but the nece&s;&s;ity of his exi&s;tence:
he pur&s;ued it at all &s;ea&s;ons, he indulged it upon all
occa&s;ions. With excellent natural parts, he trifled
away all improvement; without any ill temper, he
&s;pared no one's feelings. Yet, though not radically
vicious, nor deliberately malevolent, the egoti&s;m
which urged him to make his own amu&s;ement his fir&s;t
pur&s;uit, &s;acrificed his be&s;t friends and fir&s;t duties, if
they &s;tood in its way.</P>
<P>&startq;Come, my little girls, come!&endq; cried he, as he
entered the room; &startq;get your hats and cloaks as fa&s;t
as po&s;&s;ible; there is a public breakfa&s;t at Northwick,
and you are all expected without delay.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;udden invitation occa&s;ioned a general com|motion.
Indiana gave an involuntary jump; Camilla
and Eugenia looked delighted; and Mi&s;s Margland
&s;eemed ready to &s;econd the propo&s;ition; but Sir
Hugh, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, exclaimed: &startq;A public
breakfa&s;t, my dear boy! why where's the need of
that, when we have got &s;o good a private one?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, let us go! let us go, uncle!&endq; cried Indiana.
&startq;Mi&s;s Margland, do pray &s;peak to my uncle to let
us go!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, Sir,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;it is time
now, in all con&s;cience, for the young ladies to &s;ee a
little more of the world, and that it &s;hould be known
<PB N="93" REF="93">
who they are. I am &s;ure they have been immured
long enough, and I only wi&s;h you had been at the
ball la&s;t night, Sir, your&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me, Mrs. Margland! Lord help me! what
&s;hould I do at &s;uch a thing as that, with all this gout
in my hip?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You would have &s;een, Sir, the fine effects of
keeping the young ladies out of &s;ociety in this man|ner.
Mi&s;s Camilla, if I had not prevented it, would
have danced with I don't know who; and as to Mi&s;s
Eugenia, &s;he was as near as po&s;&s;ible to not dancing
at all, owing to nobody's knowing who &s;he was.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh had no time to reply to this attack,
from the urgency of Indiana, and the impetuo&s;ity of
Lionel, who, applying to Camilla, &s;aid: &startq;Come,
child, a&s;k my uncle your&s;elf, and then we &s;hall go
at once.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla readily made it her own reque&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear,&endq; an&s;wered Sir Hugh, &startq;I can't be &s;o
unnatural to deny you a little plea&s;ure, knowing you
to be &s;uch a merry little whirligig; not but what
you'd enjoy your&s;elf ju&s;t as much at home, if they'd
let you alone. However, as Indiana's head is &s;o
much turned upon it, for which I beg you won't think
the wor&s;e of her, Mr. Mandlebert, it being no more
than the common &s;ault of a young per&s;on no older
than her; why, you mu&s;t all go, I think, provided
you are not &s;atisfied already, which, by the breakfa&s;t
you have made, I &s;hould think likely enough to be
the ca&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>They then eagerly aro&s;e, and the females ha&s;tened
to make &s;ome change in their dre&s;s. Sir Hugh,
calling Eugenia back, &s;aid: &startq;As to you, my little
cla&s;&s;ic, I make but &s;mall doubt you will be half ready
to break your heart at mi&s;&s;ing your le&s;&s;on, knowing
hic haec, hoc, to be dearer to you, and for good rea|&s;ons
enough, too, in the end, than all the hopping
and &s;kipping in the world; &s;o if you had rather &s;tay
away, don't mind all tho&s;e dunces; for &s;o I mu&s;t
needs call them, in compari&s;on to you and Dr. Ork|borne,
though without the lea&s;t meaning to under|value
them.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="94">
Eugenia frankly acknowledged &s;he had been much
amu&s;ed the preceding evening, and wi&s;hed to be again
of the party.</P>
<P>&startq;Why then, if that's the ca&s;e,&endq; &s;aid the baronet,
the be&s;t way will be for Dr. Orkborne to be your
'&s;quire; by which means you may have a little &s;tudy
as you go along, to the end that the le&s;s time may be
thrown away in doing nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, who perceived no objection to this idea,
a&s;&s;ented, and went quietly up &s;tairs, to prepare for
&s;etting out. Sir Hugh, by no means connecting the
laughter of Lionel, nor the &s;mile of Edgar, with his
propo&s;al, gravely repeated it to Dr. Orkborne,
adding: &startq;And if you want a nice pair of gloves,
Doctor, not that I make the offer in any detriment
to your own, but I had &s;ix new pair come home ju&s;t
before my gout, which, I can a&s;&s;ure you, have never
&s;een the light &s;ince, and are as much at your &s;ervice as
if I had be&s;poke them on purpo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>The mirth of Lionel grew now &s;o outrageous, that
Dr. Orkborne, much offended, walked out of the
room without making any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>&startq;There is &s;omething,&endq; cried Sir Hugh, after a
pau&s;e, &startq;in the&s;e men of learning, prodigious nice to
deal with; however, not under&s;tanding them, in point
of their maxims, it's likely enough I may have done
&s;omething wrong; for he could not have &s;eemed
much more affronted, if I had told him I had &s;ix new
pair of gloves lying by me, which he &s;hould be never
the better for.&endq;</P>
<P>When they were all ready, Sir Hugh, calling to
Edgar, &s;aid: &startq;Now as I don't much chu&s;e to have
my girls go to the&s;e &s;ort of places often, which is a
prudence that I dare &s;ay you approve as much as my|&s;elf,
I would wi&s;h to have the mo&s;t made of them at
once; and, therefore, as I've no doubt but they'll
&s;trike up a dance, after having eat what they think
proper, why I would advi&s;e you, Mr. Mandlebert,
to let Indiana trip it away till &s;he's heartily tired, for
el&s;e &s;he'll never give it up, with a good grace, of her
own accord.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="95">
&startq;Certainly, Sir,&endq; an&s;wered Edgar, &startq;I &s;hall not
hurry the ladies.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, as to any of the re&s;t,&endq; interrupted Sir Hugh,
&startq;they'll be as &s;oon &s;atisfied as your&s;elf, except&endq;
lowering his voice &startq;Mrs. Margland, who, between
friends, &s;eems to me as glad of one of tho&s;e freaks,
as when &s;he was but &s;ixteen; which how long it is
&s;ince &s;he was no more I can't pretend to &s;ay, being a
point &s;he never mentions.&endq;</P>
<P>Then addre&s;&s;ing them in general: &startq;I wi&s;h you a
good breakfa&s;t,&endq; he cried, &startq;with all my heart,
which I think you pretty well de&s;erve, con&s;idering you
go &s;o far for it, with one clo&s;e at your elbow, but ju&s;t
&s;wallowed. And &s;o, my dear Indiana, I hope you
won't tire Mr. Mandlebert more than can't be
avoided.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How came you to engage Indiana again, Man|dlebert?&endq;
cried Lionel, in their way to the carriage.</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, finding he he|&s;itated,
&startq;there is no other partner &s;o proper for Mi&s;s
Lynmere.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And pray what's the matter with me? why am
not I as proper as Mandlebert?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e you are her relation, to be &s;ure!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; cried he, vaulting his hor&s;e, &startq;if I meet
but the charming widow, I &s;hall care for none of
you.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Public Breakfa&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THE unfitting, however cu&s;tomary, occa&s;ion of
this &s;peedy repetition of public amu&s;ement in the
town of Northwick, was, that the county a&s;&s;izes
were now held there: and the arrival of the Judges
of the land, to hear cau&s;es which kept life or death
&s;u&s;pended, was the &s;ignal for entertainment to the
<PB N="96" REF="96">
&s;urrounding neighbourhood: a hardening of huma$
feelings again&s;t human crimes and human mi&s;eries, at
which reflection revolts, however habit may per|&s;evere.</P>
<P>The young men, who rode on fir&s;t, joined the
ladies as they entered the town, and told them to
drive &s;traight to the ball-room, where the company
had a&s;&s;embled, in con&s;equence of a &s;hower of rain
which had forced them from the public garden in|tended
for the breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;Here, as they &s;topt, a poor woman, nearly in
rags, with one child by her &s;ide, and another in her
arms, approached the carriage, and pre&s;enting a pe|tition,
be&s;ought the ladies to read or hear her ca&s;e.
Eugenia, with the ready impul&s;e of generous afflu|ence,
in&s;tantly felt for her pur&s;e; but Mi&s;s Margland,
angrily holding her hand, &s;aid, with authority:
&startq;Mi&s;s Eugenia, never encourage beggars; you don't
know the mi&s;chief you may do by it.&endq; Eugenia re|luctantly
de&s;i&s;ted, but made a &s;ign to her footman to
give &s;omething for her. Edgar then alighting, ad|va$$$d
to hand them from the coach, while Lionel
ran forward to &s;ettle their tickets of admittance.</P>
<P>The woman now grew more urgent in her &s;uppli|cations,
and Mi&s;s Margland in her remon&s;trances
again&s;t attending to them.</P>
<P>Indiana, who was placed under the care of Edgar,
enchanted to again di&s;play her&s;elf where &s;ure of again
being admired, neither heard nor &s;aw the petitioner;
but dimpling and &s;miling, quickened her motions to|wards
the a&s;&s;embly $oom: while Camilla, who was
la&s;t, &s;topping &s;hort, &s;aid: &startq;What is the matter, poor
woman?&endq; and took her paper to examine.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, &s;natch$$g it from her, threw it
o$ the ground, peremptorily &s;aying: &startq;Mi&s;s Camilla,
if once you begin &s;uch a thing as that, there will be
no end to it; &s;o come along with the re&s;t of your
company, like other people.&endq;</P>
<P>She then haughtily proceeded; but Camilla,
brought up by her admirable parents never to pa&s;s
di&s;tre&s;s without inquiry, nor to refu&s;e giving at all,
<PB N="97" REF="97">
becau&s;e &s;he could give but little, remained with the
poor object, and repeated her que&s;tion. The wo|man,
&s;hedding a torrent of tears, &s;aid &s;he was wife
to one of the pri&s;oners who was to be tried the next
day, and who expected to lo&s;e his life, or be tran&s;|ported,
for only one bad action of &s;tealing a leg of
mutton; which, though &s;he knew it to be a &s;in, was
not without excu&s;e, being a $word$ offence, and com|mitted
in poverty and &s;ickne&s;$. And this, &s;he was
told, the Judges would take into con&s;ideration; but
her hu&s;band was now &s;o ill, that he could not &s;eed on
the gaol allowance, and not having wherewithal to
buy any other, would either die before his trial, or
be too weak to make known his &s;ad &s;tory in his own
behalf, for want of &s;ome wine or &s;ome b$oth to &s;up|port
him in the meanwhile.</P>
<P>Camilla, ha&s;tily giving her a &s;hilling, took one of
her petitions, and promi&s;ing to do all in her power to
&s;erve her, left the poor creature almo&s;t choaked with
&s;obbing j$y. She was flying to join her party, when
&s;he perceived Edgar at her &s;ide. &startq;I came to &s;ee,&endq;
cried he, with gli&s;tening eyes, &startq;if you were running
away from us; but you were doing far better in not
thinking of us at all.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, accu&s;tomed from her earlie&s;t childhood to
attend to the indigent and unhappy, felt neither re|treating
&s;hame, nor parading pride in the office; &s;he
gave him the petition of the poor woman, and beg|ged
he would con&s;ider if there was any thing that
could be done for her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>&startq;I had received a paper from her&s;elf,&endq; he an&s;wer|ed,
&startq;before you alighted; and I hope I &s;hould not
have neglected it: but I will now take yours, that
my memory may run no ri&s;k.&endq;</P>
<P>They then went on to the a&s;&s;embly room.</P>
<P>The company, which was numerous, was already
&s;eated at breakfa&s;t. Indiana and Camilla, now fir&s;t
&s;urveyed by day-light, again $span$ all eyes; but,
in the &s;implicity of undre$word$ the $$uperiority of Indi|ana
was no longer wholly $span$, though the ge|neral
voice was &s;till &s;trongly $span$ &s;avour.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="98">
Indiana was a beauty of &s;o regular a ca&s;t, that her
face had no feature, no look to which critici&s;m could
point as &s;u&s;ceptible of improvement, or on which ad|miration
could dwell with more delight than on the re&s;t.
No &s;tatuary could have modelled her form with more
exqui&s;ite &s;ymmetry; no painter have harmoni&s;ed her
complexion with greater brilliancy of colouring.
But here ended the liberality of nature, which, in
not fullying this fair workman&s;hip by inclo&s;ing in it
what was bad, contentedly left it vacant of whatever
was noble and d$&s;irable.</P>
<P>The beauty of Camilla, though neither perfect nor
regular, had an influence &s;o peculiar on the beholder,
it was hard to catch its fault; and the cynic connoi&s;|&s;eur,
who might per&s;evere in &s;eeking it, would in vo|luntarily
&s;urrender the &s;trict rules of his art to the
predominance of its loveline&s;s. Even judgment it|&s;elf,
the coole&s;t and la&s;t betrayed of our faculties, &s;he
took by &s;urpri&s;e, though it was not till &s;he was ab|&s;ent
the &s;eizure was detected. Her di&s;po&s;ition was
ardent in &s;incerity, her mind untainted with evil.
The reigning and radical defect of her character&mdash;
an imagination that &s;ubmitted to no control&mdash;prov|ed
not any antidote again&s;t her attractions; it caught,
by its force and fire, the quick-kindling admiration
of the lively; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by magnetic perva&s;ion,
the witchery to create &s;ympathy in the mo&s;t &s;erious.</P>
<P>In their march up the room, Camilla was &s;poken
to by a per&s;on from the tea-table, who was di&s;tinct
from every other, by being particularly ill dre&s;&s;ed;
and who, though &s;he did not know him, a&s;ked her
how &s;he did, with a familiar look of intimacy. She
&s;lightly curt&s;ied, and endeavoured to draw her party
more nimbly on; when another per&s;on, equally con|&s;picuous,
though from being accoutred in the oppo|&s;ite
extreme of full dre&s;s, quitting his &s;eat, formally
made up to her, and drawing on a &s;tiff pair of new
gloves as he &s;poke, &s;aid: &startq;So you are come at la&s;t,
ma'am! I began to think you would not come at
all, begging that gentleman's p$rdon, who told me
to the contrary $word$ night, when I thought, thinks I,
<PB N="99" REF="99">
here I've bought the&s;e new gloves, for no rea&s;on but
to oblige the young lady, and now I might as well
not have bought 'em at all.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, ready to laugh, yet much provoked at
this renewed claim from her old per&s;ecutor, Mr.
Dub&s;ter, looked vainly for redre&s;s at the mi&s;chievous
Lionel, who arc$ly an&s;wered: &startq;O, ay, true, &s;i&s;ter;
I told the gentleman, la&s;t night, you would be &s;ure
to make him amends this morning for putting him
to &s;o much expence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'm &s;ure, Sir,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dub&s;ter, &startq;I did not
&s;peak for that, expence being no great matter to me
at this time; only nobody likes to fool away their
money for nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar having now, at the end of one of the ta|bles,
&s;ecured places for the ladies, Lionel again, in
defiance of the frowns of Mi&s;s Margland, invited Mr.
Dub&s;ter to join them: even the appealing looks of
Camilla &s;erved but to increa&s;e her brother's ludi|crous
diver&s;ion, in coupling her with &s;o ridiculous a
companion; who, without &s;eeming at all aware of
the liberty he was taking, engro&s;&s;ed her wholly.</P>
<P>&startq;So I &s;ee, ma'am,&endq; he cried, pointing to Euge|nia,
&startq;you've brought that limping little body with
you again? Tom Hicks had like to have took me in
finely about her! He thought &s;he was the great for|tune
of the&s;e here parts; and if it had not been for
the young gentleman, I might have known no bet|ter
neither, for there's half the room in the &s;ame
&s;crape at this minute.&endq;</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving Camilla regard him with an unplea&s;ant
&s;urpri&s;e, he more &s;olemnly added: &startq;I a&s;k pardon,
ma'am, for mentioning the thing, which I only do
in excu&s;e for what I &s;aid la&s;t night, not knowing
then you was the fortune your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>An eager &s;ign of &s;ilence from Lionel, forbade her
explaining this mi&s;take; Mr. Dub&s;ter, therefore, pro|ceeded:</P>
<P>&startq;When Tom Hicks told me about it, I &s;aid at
the time, &s;ays I, &s;he looks more like to &s;ome &s;o$t of
an humble young per&s;on, ju&s;t brought out of a little
<PB N="100" REF="100">
good-nature to &s;ee the company, and the like of
that; for &s;he's not a bit like a lady of fortunes, with
that nud$$ing $word$; and I &s;aid to Tom Hicks, by
way of joke, &s;a$$ I, if I was to think of her, which I
don't think I &s;hall, at lea&s;t &s;he would not be much
in my way, for &s;he could not follow a body much
about, becau&s;e of that hitch in her gait, for I'm a
pretty good walker.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the ill dre&s;&s;ed man, who had alr$ady &s;poken
to Camilla, quitting his &s;eat, &s;trolled up to her, and
fa&s;t$ning his eyes upon her face, though without
$owing, made &s;ome &s;peech about the weather, with
the lounging freedom of manner of a confirmed old
acquaintance. His whole appearance had an air of
even wilful &s;lovenline&s;s: His hair was uncombed;
he was in boots, which were covered with mud; his
coat &s;eemed to have been de&s;ignedly emerged in
powder, and his univer&s;al negligence was not only
&s;habby but uncleanly. A&s;toni&s;hed and offended by
his forwardne&s;s, Camilla turned entirely away from
him.</P>
<P>Not di&s;concerted by this di&s;tance, he procured a
chair, upon which he ca&s;t him&s;elf, perfectly at his
ea&s;e, immediately behind her.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the general breakfa&s;t was over, and the
waiters were &s;ummoned to clear away the tables, and
prepare the room for dancing, the lady who had &s;o
&s;trikingly made her appearance the preceding even|ing,
again entered. She was alone, as before, and
walked up the room with the &s;ame decided air of in|difference
to all opinion; &s;ometimes knotting with
as much diligence and earne&s;tne&s;s as if her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
depended upon the rapidity of her work; and at
other times &s;topping &s;hort, &s;he applied to her eye a
near-&s;ighted gla&s;s, which hung to her finger, and
intently examined &s;ome particular per&s;on or group;
then, with a look of ab&s;ence, as if &s;he had not &s;een
a creature, &s;he hummed an opera &s;ong to her&s;elf, and
proceeded. Her rouge was remarkably well put on,
and her claim to being &s;till a &s;ine woman, though pa&s;t
<PB N="101" REF="101">
her prime, was as obvious as it as con&s;cious: Her
dre&s;s was more fanta&s;tic and &s;tudied than the night
before, in the &s;ame propo$tion as that of every other
per&s;on pr$&s;ent was more &s;imple and quiet; and the
commanding air of her c$$$tenance, and the ea&s;ine&s;s
of her carriage, &s;poke a confirmed $word$ a&s;&s;i$ance,
that her cha$$$ and her power were ab&s;olute,
wherever &s;he thought their ex$$tion worth her
trouble.</P>
<P>When &s;he came to the head of the room, &s;he
turned about, and with her gla&s;s, &s;urveyed the whole
company; then &s;milingly advancing to the &s;loven,
whom Camilla was &s;hunning, &s;he called out: &startq;O! are
yon there? what rural deity could break your re&s;t &s;o
early?</P>
<P>&startq;None!&endq; an&s;wered he, rubbing his eyes; &startq;I am
invulnerably a$$$$p at this very moment! In the very
centre of the morphetic dominions. But how bar|barou&s;ly
late you are! I &s;hould never have come to
this va&s;tly horri$ place before my ride, if I had ima|gined
you could be &s;o excruciating.&endq;</P>
<P>Struck with a j$$g$n of which &s;he could not &s;u&s;|pect
two per&s;ons to be capable, Camilla turned round
to her &s;lighted neighbour, and with the greate&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e
recogni&s;ed, upon examination, the mo&s;t brilliant
beau of the preceding evening, in the wor&s;t dre&s;&s;ed
man of the pre&s;ent morning.</P>
<P>The lady now, again holding her gla&s;s to her eye,
which &s;he directed without &s;eruple towards Camilla
and her party, &s;aid: &startq;Who have you got there?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla looked ha&s;tily away, and her whole &s;et,
aba$hed by &s;o un&s;ea&s;oned an inquiry, ca&s;t down their
eyes.</P>
<P>&startq;Hey!&endq; cried he, calmly viewing them, as if for
the fir&s;t time him&s;elf: &startq;Why, I'll tell you!&endq; Then
making her bend to hear his whi&s;per, which never|thele&s;s,
was by no means intended for her own ear
alone, he added: &startq;Two little things as pretty
as angels, and two others as ugly as&mdash;I &s;$y $o
more!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="102">
&startq;O, I take in the full force of your metaphor!&endq;
cried &s;he, laughing; &startq;and acknowledge the truth
of its contra&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla alone, as they meant, had heard them;
and a&s;hamed for her&s;elf, and provoked to find Eu|genia
coupled with Mi&s;s Margland, &s;he endeavoured
to conver&s;e with &s;ome of her own &s;ociety; but their
attention was entirely engaged by the whi&s;perers;
nor could &s;he, for more than a minute, deny her own
curio&s;ity the plea&s;ure of ob&s;erving them.</P>
<P>They now &s;poke together for &s;ome time in low
voices, laughing immoderately at the occa&s;ional &s;allies
of each other; Sir Sedley Clarendel &s;itting at his
ea&s;e, Mrs. Arlbery &s;tanding, and knotting by his
&s;ide.</P>
<P>The officers, and almo&s;t all the beaux, began to
crowd to this &s;pot: but neither the gentleman nor
the lady interrupted their di&s;cour&s;e to return or re|ceive
any &s;al$tations. Lionel, who with much eager|ne&s;s
had quitted an in&s;ide &s;eat at a long table&punc; to pay
his court to Mrs. Arlbery, could catch neither her
eye nor her ear for his bow or his compliment.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, at la&s;t, looking up in her face and
&s;miling, &s;aid: &startq;A'n't you &s;hockingly tired?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To death!&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, co$lly.</P>
<P>&startq;Why then, I am afraid, I mu&s;t po&s;itively do
the thing that's old fa&s;hioned.&endq;</P>
<P>And ri&s;ing, and making her a very elegant how,
he pre&s;ented her his &s;eat, adding: &startq;There, ma'am!
I have the honour to give you my chair&mdash;at the ri&s;$
of my reputation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould have thought,&endq; cried Lionel, now
getting forward, &startq;that omitting to give it would
rather have ri&s;ked your reputation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible you could be born before all that
was over?&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, dropping carele&s;sly
upon the chair as &s;he perceived Lionel, whom &s;he
honoured with a nod: &startq;How do do, Mr. Tyrold?
are you ju&s;t come in?&endq; But turning again to Sir
Sedley, without waiting for his an&s;wer, &startq;I &s;wear,
you barbarian,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;you have really almo&s;t
&startq;killed me with fatigue.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="103">
&startq;Have I indeed?&endq; &s;aid he, &s;miling.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter now, leaning over the table, &s;olemnly
&s;aid: &startq;I am &s;ure I &s;hould have offered the lady my
own place, if I had not been &s;o tired my&s;elf; but
Tom Hicks over-per&s;uaded me to dance a bit before
you came in, ma$am,&endq; addre&s;&s;ing Camilla, &startq;for you
have lo&s;t a deal of dancing by coming &s;o late; for
they all fell to as &s;oon as ever they come; and, as
I'm not over and above u&s;ed to it, it &s;oon makes one
a little &s;ti&s;&s;i&s;h, as one may &s;ay; and indeed, the
lady's much better off in getting a chair, for one $word$
mighty little at one's ca&s;e on the&s;e here beaches, with
nothing to lean one's back again&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And who's that?&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery to Sir
Sedley, looking Mr. Dub&s;ter full in the face.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley made &s;ome an&s;wer in a whi&s;per, which
proved highly entertaining to them both. Mr.
Dub&s;ter, with an air much offended, &s;aid to Ca|milla:
&startq;People's laughing and whi&s;pering, when
one don't know what it$s about, is not one of the
polite&s;t things, I know, for polite people to do;
and, in my mind, they ought to be above it.&endq;</P>
<P>This re&s;entment excited Lionel to join in the
laugh; and Mr. Dub&s;ter, with great gravity of
manner, ro&s;e, and &s;aid to Camilla: &startq;When you
are ready to dance, ma'am, I am willing to be your
partner, and I &s;han't engage my&s;elf to nobody el&s;e;
but I &s;hall go to t'other end of the room till you
choo&s;e to &s;tand up; for I don't much care to &s;tay
here, only to be laughed at, when I don't know
what it's for.&endq;</P>
<P>They now all left the table; and Lionel eagerly
begged permi&s;&s;ion to introduce his &s;i&s;ters and cou&s;in
to Mrs. Arlbery, who readily con&s;ented to the pro|po&s;al.</P>
<P>Indiana advanced with plea&s;ure into a circle of
beaux, who&s;e eyes were mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous to welcome
her. Camilla, though a little alarmed in being pre|&s;ented
to a lady of &s;o &s;ingular a deportment, had
yet a curio&s;ity to &s;ee more of her, that willingly &s;e|conded
her brother's motion. And Eugenia, to
<PB N="104" REF="104">
who&s;e early reflecting mind every new character and
new &s;cene opened a f$$&s;h fund for thought, if not for
knowledge, was charmed to take a nearer view of
what promi&s;ed &s;uch food for ob&s;ervation. But Mi&s;s
Margland began an angry remon&s;trance again&s;t the
proceedings of Lionel, in thus taking out of her
hands the direction of her charges. What &s;he urged,
however, was vain: Lionel was only diverted by her
wrath, and the three young ladies, as they had not
reque&s;ted the introduction, did not feel them&s;elves
re&s;pon&s;ible for its taking effect.</P>
<P>Lionel led them on: Mrs. Arlbery half ro&s;e to
return their curt&s;ies; and gave them a reception &s;o
full of vivacity and good humour, that they &s;oon
forgot the ill-will with which Mi&s;s Margland had
&s;uffered them to quit her; and even lo&s;t all recol|lection
that it belonged to them to return to her.
The &s;atisfaction of Indiana, indeed, flowed &s;imply
from the glances of admiration which every where
met her eye; but Eugenia attended to every word,
and every motion of Mrs. Arlbery, with that &s;ort
of earne&s;tne&s;s which marks an intelligent child at a
fir&s;t play; and Camilla, &s;till more &s;truck by the no|velty
of this new acquaintance, &s;carce permitted
her&s;elf to b$$$the, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e any thing &s;he
&s;aid.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery perceived their youthful wonder,
and &s;elt a propen&s;ity to increa&s;e it, which &s;trength|ened
all her powers, and called forth all her faculties.
Wit &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at will; and, with exertions which
rendered it uncommonly brilliant, &s;he di&s;played it,
now to them, now to the gentlemen, with a gaiety
&s;o fanta&s;tic, a raillery $o arch, a &s;pirit of &s;atire &s;o
&s;ea&s;oned with a delight in coquetry, and a certain
negligence of air &s;o enlivened by a whim&s;ical plea|&s;antry,
that &s;he could not have failed to &s;trike with
admiration even the mo&s;t hackneyed &s;eekers of cha|racter:
much le&s;s the inexperienced young creatures
now pre&s;ented to her; who, with open eyes and
ears, regarded her as a phenomenon, upon finding
<PB N="105" REF="105">
that the &s;plendor of her talents equalled the &s;ingu|larity
of her manners.</P>
<P>When the room was prepared for dancing, Major
Cerwood brought to Indiana Mr. Macder&s;ey, the
young En&s;ign who had &s;o improperly addre&s;&s;ed her
at the b$ll; and, after a formal apology, in his
name, for what had pa&s;&s;ed, begged the honour of
her hand for him this morning. Indiana, flattered
and fluttered together by this ceremony, almo&s;t for|got
Edgar, who &s;tood quietly but watchfully aloof,
and was actually giving her con&s;ent when, meeting
his eye, &s;he recollected &s;he was already engaged.
Mr. Macder&s;ey hoped for more &s;ucce&s;s another time,
and Edgar advanced to lead his fair partner to her
place.</P>
<P>Major Cerwood offered him&s;elf to Camilla; but
Mr. Dub&s;ter coming forward, pulled him by the el|bow,
and making a &s;tiff low bow, &s;aid: &startq;Sir, I
a&s;k your pardon, for taking the liberty of giving you
&s;uch a jog, but the young lady's been engaged to
me ever &s;o long.&endq; The Major looked &s;urpri&s;ed;
but, ob&s;erving that Camilla coloured, he bowed re|&s;pectfully
and retreated.</P>
<P>Camilla, a&s;hamed of her beau, determined not to
dance at all: though &s;he &s;aw, with much vexation,
upon the general di&s;per&s;ion, Mi&s;s Margland approach
to claim her. Educated in all the harmony of con|tentment
and benevolence, &s;he had a horror of a
temper &s;o $$a&s;cible, that made it a penance to re|main
a moment in its vicinity. Mr. Dub&s;ter, how|ever,
le&s;t her not alone to it: when &s;he po&s;itively
refu&s;ed his hand, he &s;aid it was equal agreeable to
him to have only a little di&s;h of chat with her; and
compo&s;edly &s;tationed him&s;elf before her. Eugenia
had already been taken out by the hand&s;ome &s;tran|ger,
with whom &s;he had danced the evening before;
and Lionel, bewitched with Mrs. Arlbery, enli&s;ted
him&s;elf entirely in her train; and with Sir Sedley
Clarendel, and almo&s;t every man of any con&s;equence
in the room, declined all dancing for the plea&s;ure of
attending her.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="106">
Mr. Dub&s;ter, unacquainted with the natural high
&s;pirits of Camilla, inferred nothing to his own di&s;ad|vantage
from her &s;ilence, but talked ince&s;&s;antly him|&s;elf
with perfect complacency. &startq;Do you know,
ma'am,&endq; cried he, &startq;ju&s;t as that elderly lady, that,
I &s;uppo&s;e, is your mamma, took you all away in
that hurry la&s;t night, up comes the boy with my new
pair of gloves! but though I $un down directly to
tell you of it, there was no making the old lady
&s;top; which I was fool to try at; for as to women,
I know their ob&s;tinacy of old. But what I grudged
the mo&s;t was, as &s;oon as I come up again, as ill luck
would have it, Tom Hicks finds me my own t'other
glove! So there I had two pair, when I might as
well have had never a one!&endq;</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that Eugenia was dancing, &startq;Lack a|day!&endq;
he exclaimed, &startq;I'll lay a wager that poor
gentleman has been took in, ju&s;t as I was ye&s;terday!
He thinks that young lady that's had the &s;mall-pox
&s;o bad, is you, ma'am! 'Twould be a fine joke if
&s;uch a mi&s;take as that &s;hould get the little lame duck,
as I call her, a hu&s;band! He'd be in a fine hobble
when he found he'd got nothing but her ugly face
for his bargain. Though, provided &s;he'd had the
$hino, it would not much have &s;ignified: for, as to
being pretty or not, it's no great matter in a wife.
A man &s;oon tires of &s;eeing nothing but the &s;ame
face, if it's one of the be&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla here, in the mid&s;t of her chagrin, could
not forbear a&s;king him if he was married? &startq;Yes,
ma'am,&endq; an&s;wered he calmly, &startq;I've had two wives
to my &s;hare already; &s;o I know what I'm &s;peaking
of; though I've buried them both. Why it was all
along of my wives, what with the money I had with
one, and what with the money I had with the other,
that I got out of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o &s;oon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You were very much obliged to them, then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, yes, ma'am, as to that, I can't &s;ay to
the contrary, now that they're gone: but I can't
&s;ay I had much comfort with 'em while they lived.
They was always a thinking they had a right to
<PB N="107" REF="107">
what they had a mind, becau&s;e of what they brought
me; &s;o that I had enough to do to &s;crape a little
matter together, in ca&s;e of outliving them. One of
'em has not been dead above a twelvemonth, or there
about; the&s;e are the fir&s;t clothes I've bought &s;ince I
left off my blacks.&endq;</P>
<P>When Indiana pa&s;t them, he expre&s;&s;ed his admi|ration
of her beauty. &startq;That young lady, ma'am,&endq;
he &s;aid, &startq;cuts you all up, &s;ure enough. She's as
fine a piece of red and white as ever I &s;ee. I could
think of &s;uch a young lady as that my&s;elf, if I did
not remember that I thought no more of my wife
that was pretty, than of my wi&s;e that was ugly,
after the fir&s;t month or &s;o. Beauty goes for a mere
nothing in matrimony, when once one's u&s;ed to it.
Be&s;ides, I've no great thoughts at pre&s;ent of enter|ing
into the &s;tate again of one while, at any rate,
being but ju&s;t got to be a little comfortable.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;econd dance was now called, when Mrs.
Arlbery, coming &s;uddenly behind Camilla, &s;aid, in
a low voice, &startq;Do you know who you are talking
with?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, ma'am!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A young tinker, my dear! that's all!&endq; And,
with a provoking nod, &s;he retreated.</P>
<P>Camilla, half ready to laugh, half to cry, re|&s;trained
her&s;elf with difficulty from running after her;
and Mr. Dub&s;ter, ob&s;erving that &s;he abruptly turned
away, and would li&s;ten no more, again claimed her
for his partner; and, upon her ab&s;olute refu&s;al, &s;ur|pri&s;ed
and affronted, walked off in &s;ilence. She
was then finally condemned to the moro&s;e &s;ociety of
Mi&s;s Margland: and invectives again&s;t Sir Hugh
for mi&s;management, and Lionel, with whom now
that lady was at open war, for impertinence, &s;illed
up the re&s;t of her time, till the company was inform|ed
that refre&s;hments were &s;erved in the card-room.</P>
<P>Thither, immediately, every body flocked, with
as much &s;peed and avidity, as if they had learnt to
appreciate the ble&s;&s;ing of plenty, by the experience
of want. Such is the vacancy of di&s;&s;ipated plea&s;ure,
<PB N="108" REF="108">
that, never &s;atisfied with what it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, an open|ing
always remains for &s;omething yet to be tried,
and, on that &s;omething &s;till to come, all enjoyment
&s;eems to depend.</P>
<P>The day beginning now to clear, the &s;a&s;hes of a
large bow-window were thrown up. Sir Sedley Cla|rendel
&s;auntered thither, and in&s;tantly every body
followed, as if there were no breathing any where
el&s;e; declaring, while they pre&s;&s;ed upon one ano|ther
almo&s;t to &s;uffocation, that nothing was &s;o reviv|ing
as the fre&s;h air: and, in a minute, not a creature
was to be &s;een in any other part of the room.</P>
<P>Here, in full view, &s;tood &s;undry haple&s;s relations
of the poorer part of the pri&s;oners to be tried the
next morning, who, with &s;upplicating hands and
eyes, implored the compa&s;&s;ion of the company,
whom their very calamities a&s;&s;embled for amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Nobody took any notice of them; nobody ap|peared
even to &s;ee them: but, one by one, all
glided gently away, and the bow-window was pre|&s;ently
the only empty &s;pace in the apartment.</P>
<P>Camilla, contented with having already pre&s;ented
her mite, and Eugenia, with having given her's in
commi&s;&s;ion, retired unaffectedly with the re&s;t; while
Mi&s;s Margland, &s;hrugging up her &s;houlders, and
declaring there was no end of beggars, pompou&s;ly
added, &startq;However, we gave before we came in.&endq;</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently, a paper was handed about to collect
half guineas for a raffle. A beautiful locket, &s;et
round with pearls, ornamented at the top with a
little knot of &s;mall brilliants, and very clegantly
&s;haped, with a &s;pace left for a braid of hair, or a
cypl$er, was produced; and, as if by magnetic
power, attracted into almo&s;t every hand the capri|cious
coin, which di&s;tre&s;s, but the moment before
had repelled.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland lamented &s;he had only guineas or
&s;ilver, but &s;uffered Edgar to be her payma&s;ter; pri|vately
re&s;olving, that if &s;he won the locket, &s;he would
remember the debt: Eugenia, amu&s;ed in &s;eeing the
humour of all that was going forward, readily put
<PB N="109" REF="109">
in; Indiana, &s;atisfied her uncle would repay the
expences of the day, with a heart panting from hope
of the prize, did the &s;ame; but Camilla hung back,
totally unu&s;ed to hazard upon what was unnece&s;&s;ary
the little allowance &s;he had been taught to &s;pend
&s;paringly upon her&s;elf, that &s;omething might be al|ways
in her power to be&s;tow upon others. The
character of this ra&s;&s;le was not of that intere&s;ting
nature which calls forth from the a&s;&s;luent and ea&s;y
re&s;pect as well as aid: the prize belonged to no one
whom adver&s;ity compelled to change what once was
an innocent luxury, into the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence;
it was the mere common mode of getting rid of a
mere common bauble, which no one had thought
worth the full price affixed to it by its toyman. She
knew not, however, till now, how hard to re&s;i&s;t was
the contagion of example, and felt a &s;truggle in her
&s;elf-denial, that made her, when &s;he put the locket
down, withdraw from the crowd, and re&s;olve not to
look at it again.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had ob&s;erved her, read her &s;ecret
conflict with an emotion which impelled him to
follow her, that he might expre&s;s his admiration;
but he was &s;topt by Mrs. Arlbery, who ju&s;t then
ha&s;tily attacked her with, &startq;What have you done
with your friend the tinker, my dear?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, laughing, though extremely a&s;hamed,
&s;aid, &s;he knew nothing at all about him.</P>
<P>&startq;You talked with him, then, by way of experi|ment,
to &s;ee how you might like him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, indeed! I merely an&s;wered him when I
could not help it; but &s;till I thought, at a ball,
gentlemen only would pre&s;ent them&s;elves.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And how many couple,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery,
&s;miling, &startq;do you calculate would, in that ca&s;e,
&s;tand up?&endq;</P>
<P>She then ordered one of the beaux who attended
her, to bring her a chair, and told another to fetch
her the locket. Edgar was again advancing to Ca|milla,
when Lionel, who&s;e de&s;ire to obtain the good
graces of Mrs. Arlbery, had &s;ugge&s;ted to him an
<PB N="110" REF="110">
anticipation of her commands, pu&s;hed forward with
the locket.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, really, it is not ugly,&endq; cried &s;he, taking
it in her hand: &startq;Have you put in yet, Mi&s;s Ty|rold?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, ma'am.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I am va&s;tly glad of that; for now we will
try our fortune together.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, though &s;ecretly blu&s;hing at what &s;he felt
was an extravagance, could not with&s;tand this invi|tation:
&s;he gave her half guinea.</P>
<P>Edgar, di&s;appointed, retreated in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The money being collected, and the names of
ra$$$ers taken down, information was given, that the
prize was to be thrown for in three days time, at
one o'clock at noon, in the &s;hop of a book&s;eller at
Northwick.</P>
<P>Some of the company now departed; others pre|pared
for a la&s;t dance. Mi&s;s Margland de&s;ired Lionel
to &s;ee for their carriage; but Lionel had no greater
joy than to di&s;regard her. Indiana a&s;ked earne&s;tly
to &s;tay longer; Mi&s;s Margland &s;aid, &s;he could only
give way to her reque&s;t, upon condition her partner
&s;hould be Mr. Mandlebert. It was in vain &s;he urged
that &s;he was already engaged to Colonel Andover;
Mi&s;s Margland was inexorable, and Edgar, laughing,
&s;aid, he &s;hould certainly have the whole co$ps upon
his back; but the honour was &s;ufficient to counter|balance
the ri&s;k, and he would, therefore, beg the
Colonel's patience.</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Mandlebert,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;I
know enough of quarrels at balls about partners, and
ladies changing their minds, to know how to act
pretty well in tho&s;e ca&s;es; I &s;hall de&s;ire, therefore,
to &s;peak to the Colonel my&s;elf, and not tru&s;t two
gentlemen together upon &s;uch a nice matter.&endq;</P>
<P>She then be$koned to the Colonel, who &s;tood at
a little di&s;tance, and, taking him apart, told him,
&s;he flattered her&s;elf he would not be offended, if
Mi&s;s Lynmere &s;hould dance again with Mr. Mandle|bert,
<PB N="111" REF="111">
though rather out of rule, as there were par|ticular
rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>The Colonel, with a &s;mile, &s;aid he perceived Mr.
Mandlebert was the happy man, and acquie&s;eed.</P>
<P>A general murmur now ran buzzing round the
room, that Mr. Mandlebert and Mi&s;s Lynmere were
publicly contracted to each other; and, among&s;t
many who heard with di&s;plea&s;ure that the young
beauty was betrothed before &s;he was exhibited to
view, Mr. Macder&s;$y appeared to &s;uffer the mo&s;t
&s;erious mortification.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this dance was over, Edgar conducted
his ladies to an apartment below &s;tairs, and went in
&s;earch of the carriage.</P>
<P>He did not return for &s;ome time. Mi&s;s Margland,
as u&s;ual, grumbled; but Camilla, perceiving Mrs.
Arlbery, rejoiced in the delay; and &s;tationed her|&s;elf
by her &s;ide, all alive in attending to the plea|&s;antry
with which &s;he was amu&s;ing her&s;elf and tho&s;e
around her.</P>
<P>When Edgar, who &s;eemed out of breath from
running, came back, he made but &s;hort an&s;wers to
the murmurs of Mi&s;s Margland; and, ha&s;tening to
Camilla, &s;aid: &startq;I have been with your petition$:
&s;he has all that can comfort her for the pre&s;ent;
and I have learnt the name of her hu&s;band's coun&s;el.
You will be &s;o good as to excu&s;e me at dinner to
Sir Hugh. I &s;hall remain here till I can judge what
may be done.&endq;</P>
<P>The attention of Camilla was now effectually with|drawn
from Mrs. Arlbery, and the pure&s;t delight of
which human feelings are &s;u&s;ceptible, took &s;udden
and &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her youthful mind, in the idea
of being in&s;trumental to the pre&s;ervation of a fellow|creature.</P>
<P>Edgar &s;aw, in the change, yet brightne&s;s of her
countenance, what p$&s;&s;ed within;&mdash;and his di&s;|appointment
concerning the ra&s;tle was immediately
forgotten.</P>
<P>A &s;hort con&s;ultation followed, in which both
&s;poke with &s;o much energy, as not only to overpower
<PB N="112" REF="112">
the remon&s;trances of Mi&s;s Margland for their depar|ture,
but to catch the notice of Mrs. Arlbery, who,
coming forward, and leaning her hand on the &s;houlder
of Camilla, &s;aid: &startq;Tell me what it is that has
thus animated you? Have you heard any good tid|ings
of your new friend?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla in&s;tantly and eagerly related the &s;ubject
that occupied them, without ob&s;erving that the
whole company around were &s;miling, at her earne&s;t|ne&s;s
in a cau&s;e of &s;uch common di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;You are new, my dear,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery,
patting her cheek, &startq;very new; but I take the whim
&s;ometimes of being charitable my&s;elf, for a little
variety. It always looks pretty; and begging is no
bad way of &s;hewing o$$ one's powers. So give me
your documents, and I'll give you my eloquence.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla pre&s;ented her the petition, and &s;he invited
Mandlebert to dine with her. Mi&s;s Margland then
led the way, and the female party returned to
Cleves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Ra&s;$le.</HEAD>
<P>IT was late when Edgar returned to Cleves. Ca|milla
flew to meet him. He told her every thing re|lative
to her petitioner was in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous
train; he had &s;een the pri&s;oner, heard the particulars
of his &s;tory, which all tended to his exculpation;
and Mrs. Arlbery had contrived to make acquaint|ance
with his coun&s;el, whom &s;he found perfectly
well di&s;po&s;ed to exert him&s;elf in the cau&s;e, and whom
&s;he had invited to a &s;plendid &s;upper. The trial was
to take place the next morning.</P>
<P>Camilla, already powerfully &s;truck with Mrs.
Arlbery, was enchanted to find her thus active in
benevolence.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="113">
Edgar was to dine with that lady the next day,
and to learn the event of their joint exertions.</P>
<P>This proved all that could be wi&s;hed. The pro|&s;ecution
had been mild: the judge and jury had
been touched with compa&s;&s;ion; and the venial of|fender
had been relea&s;ed with a gentle $eprimand.</P>
<P>Mandlebert returned to communicate the&s;e tidings
to Camilla, with a pl$a&s;ure exactly in uni&s;on with her
own. Mrs. Arlbery, he avewed, had been as zealous
as him&s;elf; and had manife&s;ted a charity of di&s;po&s;ition
which the &s;lightine&s;s of her manners had not led him
to expect.</P>
<P>The next object of attention was the raffle, which
was to take place the following morning.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was a ver&s;e to letting his nieces go abroad
again &s;o &s;oon: but Mi&s;s Margland, extremely anxious
about her own chance for the prize, &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erted
its nece&s;&s;ity; inveighed again&s;t the mi&s;management of
every thing at Cleves, &s;tifled all her complaints of
Lionel, and pronounced a po&s;itive deei&s;ion, that, to
carry Indiana to public places, was the &s;ole method
of promoting the match.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then, willing to believe, and yet more
willing to get rid of di&s;puting with her, no longer
with-held his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>They were advanced within half a mile of North|wick,
when a &s;ick man, $a$nfully &s;upported by a
woman with a child in her arms, caught their eyes.
The ready hand of Eugenia was immediately in her
pocket; Camilla, locking more intently upon the
group, perceived another child, and pre&s;ently re|cogni&s;ed
the wife of the pri&s;oner. She called to the
coachman to &s;top, and Edgar, at the &s;ame moment,
rode up to the carriage.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland angrily ordered the man to drive
on, &s;aying, &s;he was quite &s;ick of being thus for ever
infe&s;ted with beggars; who really came &s;o often,
they were no better than pick-pockets.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="114">
&startq;O, don't refu&s;e to let me &s;peak to them!&endq; cried
Camilla; &startq;it will be &s;uch a plea&s;ure to &s;ee their joy!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes! they look in much joy indeed! they
&s;eem as if they had not eat a mor&s;$l the&s;e three
weeks! Drive on, I &s;ay, coachman! I like no &s;uch
melanchely fights, for my part. They always make
me ill. I wonder how any body can bear them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But we may help them; we may a&s;&s;i&s;t them!&endq;
&s;aid Camilla, with increa&s;ing earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;And pray, when they have got all our money,
who is to help us?&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, delighted to give, but unhabituated to
any other exertion, &s;lung half a crown to them; and
Indiana, begging to look out, &s;aid, &startq;Dear! I
never &s;aw a pri&s;oner before!&endq;</P>
<P>Encouraged by an expre&s;&s;ive look from Camilla,
Edgar di&s;mounted to hand her from the carriage, af|fecting
not to hear the remon&s;trances of Mi&s;s Mar|gland,
though &s;he &s;crupled not to deliver them very
audibly. Eugenia langui&s;hed to join them, but could
not venture to di&s;obey a direct command; and In|diana,
ob&s;erving the road to be very du&s;ty, &s;ubmitted,
to &s;av$ a pair of beautiful new &s;hoes.</P>
<P>Camilla had all the gratification &s;he promi&s;ed her|&s;elf,
in witne&s;&s;ing the happine&s;s of the poor peti|tioner.
He was crawling to Cleves, with his family,
to offer thanks. They were pennile&s;s, &s;ick, and
wretched; yet the pre&s;ervation of the poor man
&s;eemed to make mi&s;ery light to them all. Edgar
de&s;ired to know what were their de&s;igns for the fu|ture.
The man an&s;wered that he &s;hould not dare go
back to his own country, becau&s;e there his di&s;grace
was known, and he &s;hould procure no work; nor,
indeed, was he now able to do any. &startq;So we mu&s;t
make up our minds to beg from door to door, and in
the &s;treets, and on the high road,&endq; he continued;
&startq;till I get back a little &s;trength; and can earn a
living more creditably.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But as long as we have kept you alive, and
&s;aved you from being tran&s;ported,&endq; &s;aid his wife,
&startq;for which all thanks be due to this good gentleman,
<PB N="115" REF="115">
we &s;hall mind no hard&s;hips, and never go a&s;tray again,
in wicked unthinkingne&s;s of this great mercy.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar inquired what had been their former occu|pations;
they an&s;wered, they had both been day|workers
in the field, till a &s;it of &s;ickne&s;s had hin|dered
the poor man from getting his livelihood: pe|nury
and hunger then pre&s;&s;ing hard upon them all,
he had been tempted to commit the offence for which
he was taken, and brought to death's door. &startq;But
as now,&endq; he added, &startq;I have been &s;aved, I &s;hall
make it a warning for the time to c$me, and never
give my&s;elf up to &s;o bad a cour&s;e again.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar a&s;ked the woman what money &s;he had le&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Sir, none! for we had things to pay, and
people to &s;atisfy, and &s;o every thing you and the
good ladies gave us, is all gone; for while any thing
was left us, they would not be $a&s;y. But this is no
great mi&s;chief now, as my hu&s;band is not taken away
from us, and is come to a right &s;en&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I believe,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &startq;you are very good
&s;ort of people, however di&s;tre&s;s had mi&s;guided you.&endq;</P>
<P>He then put &s;omething into the man's hand, and
Eugenia, who from the carriage window $word$ what
pa&s;&s;ed, flung him another half crown; Camilla added
a &s;hilling, and turning &s;uddenly away, walked a few
paces from them all.</P>
<P>Edgar, gently following, inquired if any thing
was the matter; her eyes were full of tears: &startq;I was
thinking,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;what my dear father would
have &s;aid, had he &s;een me giving half a guinea for a
toy, and a &s;hilling to &s;uch poor &s;tarving people as
the&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, what would he have &s;aid?&endq; cried Edgar,
charmed with her penitence, though joining in the
apprehended cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>&startq;He would more than ever have pitied tho&s;e who
want money, in &s;eeing it &s;o &s;quand$red by one who
&s;hould better have remembered his le&s;&s;ons! O, if I
could but recover that half guinea!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Will you give me leave to get it back $or you?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="116">
&startq;Leave? you would lay me under the greate&s;t
obligation! How far half a gu$$ea would go here,
in poverty &s;uch as this!&endq;</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;ured her he could regain it without diffi|cult;
and then, telling the poor people to po&s;tpone
their walk to Cleves till the evening, when Camilla
meant to prepare her uncle, al&s;o to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, he
handed her to the coach, with feeling$ yet more
plea&s;ed than her own, and galloped forward to exe|cute
his commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was ready at the door of the library to receive
them. As they alighted, Camilla eagerly cried:
&startq;Well! have you &s;ucceeded?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Can you tru&s;t your&s;elf to this &s;pot, and to a re|view
of the allurement,&endq; an&s;wered he, &s;miling, and
holding half a guineaa between his fingers, &startq;yet be
content to &s;ee your chance for the prize withdrawn?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O give it me!&endq; give it me!&endq; cried &s;he, almo&s;t
&s;eizing it from him, &startq;my dear father will be &s;o glad
to hear I have not &s;pent it &s;o f$$li&s;hly.&endq;</P>
<P>The rafflers were not yet a&s;&s;embled; no one was
in the &s;hop but a well dre&s;&s;ed elegant young man,
who was reading at a table, and who neither rai&s;ed
his eyes at their entrance, nor &s;uffered their di&s;cour&s;e
to interrupt his attention; yet though ab&s;tracted from
outward objects, his &s;tudiou&s;ne&s;s was not of a &s;olemn
ca&s;t; he &s;eemed wrapt in what h$ was reading with
a plea&s;ure amounting to extacy. He &s;tarted, acted,
&s;miled, and looked pen&s;ive in turn; while his &s;eatures
were thrown into a thou&s;and different expre&s;&s;ions, and
his per&s;on was almo&s;t writhed with perpetually
varying ge&s;tures. From time to time his rapture
broke forth into loud exclamations of &startq;Exqui&s;ite!
exqui&s;ite!&endq; while he beat the leaves of the book
violently with his hands, in token of applau&s;e, or
lifting them up to his lips, almo&s;t devoured with ki&s;&s;es
the pa&s;&s;ages that charmed him. Sometimes he read
a few words aloud, calling out &startq;Heavenly!&endq; and
vehemently &s;tamping his approbation with his feet;
then &s;uddenly &s;hutting up the book, folded his arms,
and ca&s;ting his eyes towards the ceiling, uttered:</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="117">
&startq;O too much! too much! there is no &s;tanding it!&endq;
yet again, the next minute, opened it and re&s;umed
the lecture.</P>
<P>The youthful group was much diverted with this
unintended exhibition. To Eugenia alone it did not
appear ridiculous; &s;he &s;imply envied his tran&s;ports,
and only wi&s;hed to di&s;cover by what book they were
excited. Edgar and Camilla amu&s;ed them&s;elves with
conjecturing various authors; Indiana and Mi&s;s Mar|gland
required no &s;uch aid to pa&s;s their time, while,
with at lea&s;t equal delight, they contemplated the
hoped-for prize.</P>
<P>Lionel now bounced in: &startq;Why what,&endq; cried he,
&startq;are you all doing in this mu&s;ty old &s;hop, when Mrs.
Arlbery and all the world are enjoying the air on the
public walks?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was in&s;tantly for joining that lady; but
Engenia felt an unconquerable curio&s;ity to learn the
running title of the book. She &s;tole &s;oftly round to
look over the &s;noulder of the reader, and her re&s;pect
for his raptures increa&s;ed, when &s;he &s;aw they were
rai&s;ed by Thom&s;on's Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Neither this approach, nor the loud call of Lionel,
had interrupted the attention of the young &s;tudent,
who perceived and regarded nothing but what he
was about; and though occa&s;ionally he cea&s;ed read|ing
to indulge in pa&s;&s;ionate ejaculations, he &s;eemed
to hold every thing el&s;e beneath his con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Lionel, drawn to ob&s;erve him from the circuit
made by Eugenia, exclaimed: &startq;What, Melmond&punc;
why, how long have you been in Hamp&s;hire?&endq;</P>
<P>The youth, &s;urpri&s;ed from his ab&s;ence of mind by
the &s;ound of his own name, looked up and &s;aid:
&startq;Who's that?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, when the deuce did you come into this
part of the world?&endq; cried Lionel, approaching him
to &s;hake hands.</P>
<P>&startq;O! for pity's &s;ake,&endq; an&s;wered he, with energy,
&startq;don't interrupt me!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="118">
&startq;Why not? have not you enough of that dry
work at Oxford? Come, come, have done with this
boyi&s;h &s;tuff, and behave like a man.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You di$ract me,&endq; an&s;wered Melmond, motion|ing
him away: &startq;I am in a &s;cene that entrances me
to Ely&s;ium! I have never read it &s;ince I could ap|preciate
it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What! old Thom&s;on?&endq; &s;aid Lionel, peeping
over him; &startq;why, I never read him at all. Come,
man! (giving him a &s;lap on the &s;houlder,) come
along with me, and I'll &s;hew you &s;omething more
worth looking at.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will drive me mad, if you break in upon
this epi&s;ode! 'tis a picture of all that is divine upon
earth! hear it, only hear it!&endq;</P>
<P>He then began the truly elegant and feeling de|&s;cription
that concludes Thom&s;on's Spring; and
though Lionel, with a loud &s;hout, cried: &startq;Do you
think I come hither for &s;uch fogrum &s;tuff as that?&endq;
and ran out of the &s;hop; the &startq;wrapt enthu&s;ia&s;$&endq;
continued reading aloud, too much delighted with
the pathos of his own voice in expre&s;&s;ing the &s;enti|ments
of the poet, to deny him&s;elf a regale &s;o &s;ooth|ing
to his $ars.</P>
<P>Eugenia, enchanted, &s;tood on tip-toe to hear him&punc;
her uplifted finger petitioning &s;ilence all around, and
her heart fondly repeating, O ju&s;t &s;uch a youth be
Clermont! ju&s;t &s;uch his pa&s;&s;ion for reading! ju&s;t &s;uch
his fervour for poetry! ju&s;t &s;uch his exaltation of de|light
in literary yet dome&s;tic felicity!</P>
<P>Mandlebert, al&s;o, caught by the rehear&s;al of his
favourite picture of a &s;cheme of human happine&s;s,
which no time, no repetition can make vapid to a
feeling heart, &s;tood plea&s;ed and attentive to hear
him; even Indiana, though &s;he li&s;tened not to the
matter, was &s;truck by the manner in which it was
delivered, which &s;o re&s;embled dramatic recitation,
that &s;he thought her&s;elf at a play, and full of wonder,
advanced &s;traight before him, to look full in his face,
and watch the motions of his right arm, with which
he acted ince&s;&s;antly, while the le&s;t held his book.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="119">
Mi&s;s Margland concluded he was a &s;trolling player,
and did not &s;uffer him to draw her eyes from the
locket. But when, at the words
<Q><L>&startq;&mdash;$word$,</L>
<L>Retirement, rural $word$, $word$, books,</L>
<L>Ea&s;e and $span$ ful life,</L>
<L>Progre&s;&s;ive $word$, and appr$$ing Heaven,&endq;</L></Q>
Mandlebert turned &s;oftly round to read their impre&s;|&s;ion
on the countenance of Camilla&mdash;&s;he was gone!</P>
<P>Attracted by her wi&s;h to &s;ee more of Mrs. Arl|bery,
&s;he had run out of the &s;hop after $ionel, before
$he either kn$w what was reading, or was mi&s;&s;ed by
tho&s;e the reader had eng$$ged. Edgar, though di&s;|appointed,
wondered he &s;hould have &s;tayed him&s;elf
to li&s;ten to what had long been familiar to him, and
was quietly gliding away when he &s;aw her returning.
He then went back to his po$$, wondering, with &s;till
le&s;s &s;atisfaction, how &s;he could ab&s;ent her&s;elf from
hearing what &s;o well was worth her &s;tudying.</P>
<P>The young man, when he came to the concluding
line:</P>
<Q>To &s;eenes where love and l$i&s;s immertal reign!</Q>
<P>ro&s;e, let fall the book, cla&s;ped his hands with a thea|trical
air, and was ca&s;ting his eyes upwards in a fer|vent
and willing trance, when he perceived Indiana
&s;tanding immediately before him.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed and a&s;hamed, his &s;ublimity &s;uddenly &s;or|&s;ook
him; his arms dropt, and his hands were &s;lipt
into his wai&s;$coat pockets.</P>
<P>But, the very next moment, the &s;en&s;ation of &s;hame
and of &s;elf was &s;uper&s;eded by the fair object that had
thus arou&s;ed him. Her beauty, her youth, her at|titude
of examination, &s;truck him at fir&s;t with an
amazement that pre&s;ently gave place to an admira|tion
as violent as it was &s;udden. He &s;tarted back,
bowed profoundly, without any pretence for bowing
at all, and then rivetting his eyes, in which his whole
&s;oul &s;eemed centred, on her lovely face, &s;tood view|ing
<PB N="120" REF="120">
her with a look of homage, motionle&s;s, yet en|raptured.</P>
<P>Indiana, &s;till conceiving this to be &s;ome &s;ort of
acting, unaba&s;hed kept her po&s;t, expecting every
moment he would begin &s;pouting &s;omething more.
But the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the young Oxonian had
changed its object; the charms of poetry yielded to
the &s;uperior charms of beauty, and while he gazed
on the fair Indiana, his ferv$nt mind &s;ancied her
&s;ome being of cele&s;tial order, wonderfully accorded
to his view: How, or for what purpo&s;e, he as little
knew as cared. The play of imagination, in the
romance of early youth, is rarely interrupted with
&s;cruples of probability.</P>
<P>This &s;cene of dumb tran&s;port and unfixed expecta|tion,
was broken up neither by the admirer nor the ad|mired,
but by the entrance of Mrs. Arlbery, Sir Sedley
Clarendel, Lionel, the officers, and many of the re&s;t of
the company that had been pre&s;ent at the public break|fa&s;t:
Nor would even this intru&s;ion have di&s;engaged the
young Oxonian from his devout and extatic adora|tion,
had it been equally indifferent to Indiana; but
the appearance of a party of gay officers was not, to
her, a matter of little moment. Eager for the no|tice
in which &s;he delighted, &s;he looked round in full
confidence of receiving it. The rapture of the
Oxonian, as &s;he had &s;een it kindled while he was
reading, &s;he attributed to &s;omething &s;he did not un|der&s;tand,
and took in it, therefore, no part; but
the adulation of the officers was by no means am|biguous,
and its acceptance was as obvious as its
pre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Willingly, therefore, as well as immediately en|compa&s;&s;ed,
&s;he received a thou&s;and compliments, and
in the gratification of hearing them, completely for|got
her late &s;hort &s;urpri&s;e; but the Oxonian, more
forcibly &s;truck, ardently followed her with his eyes,
&s;tarted back theatrically at every change of attitude
which di&s;played her fine figure, and at her &s;miles
&s;miled again, from the uncontrollable &s;ympathy of a
fa&s;cinated imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="121">
Mi&s;s Margland felt no &s;mall pride in &s;eeing her
pupil thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;ince it marked the &s;hrewd|ne&s;s
of her capacity in foretelling the effect of bring|ing
her forth. Anxious to &s;hare in a con&s;equence
to which &s;he had indu&s;triou&s;ly contributed, &s;he para|dingly
forced her way through the group, and calling
the attentiion of Indiana to her&s;elf, &s;aid: &startq;I am glad
you came away, my dear; for I am &s;ure that man is
only a poor &s;trolling player.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear! let me look at him again!&endq; cried In|diana;
&startq;for I never &s;aw a player before; only at a
play.&endq;</P>
<P>She then turned back to examine him.</P>
<P>Enchanted to again meet her eyes, the youth
bowed with inten&s;e re&s;pect, and advanced a few paces,
as if with intentiion to &s;peak to her, though imme|diately
and with &s;till more precipitance he retreated,
from being ready with nothing to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Lionel, going up to him, and pulling him by the
arm, cried: &startq;Why, man! what's come to you?
The&s;e are wor&s;e heroics than I have &s;een you in yet.&endq;</P>
<P>The bright eyes of Indiana being &s;till fixed upon
him, he di&s;dained all notice of Lionel, beyond a
&s;ilent repul&s;e.</P>
<P>Indiana, having now &s;atisfied her curio&s;ity, re|&s;tored
her attention to the beaux that &s;urrounded her.
The Oxonian, half &s;ighing, unfolded his cla&s;ped
hands, one of which he repo&s;ed upon the &s;houlder of
Lionel.</P>
<P>&startq;Come, prithee, be a little le&s;s in alt,&endq; cried
Lionel, &startq;and an&s;wer a man when he &s;peaks to you.
Where did you leave Smyth&s;on?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who is that divinity; can you tell me?&endq; &s;aid
the Oxonian in a low and re&s;pectful tone of inquiry.</P>
<P>&startq;What divinity?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What divinity? in&s;en&s;ible Tyrold! ta&s;tele&s;s!
adamantine! Look, look yonder, and a&s;k me again
if you can!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O what; my cou&s;in Indiana?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your cou&s;in? have you any affinity with &s;uch a
creature as that? O Tyrold! I glory in your ac|quaintance!
<PB N="123" REF="122">
&s;he is all I ever read of! all I ever con|ceived!
&s;he is beauty in its very e&s;&s;ence! &s;he is ele|gance,
delicacy, and &s;en&s;ibility per&s;oni&s;ied!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All very true,&endq; &s;aid Lionel; &startq;but how &s;hould
you know any thing of her be&s;ides her beauty?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How? by looking at her! Can you view that
countenance and a&s;k me how? Are not tho&s;e eyes all
&s;oul? Does not that mouth promi&s;e every thing that
is intelligent? Can tho&s;e lips ever move but to dif|fu&s;e
&s;weetne&s;s and &s;miles? I mu&s;t not look at her
again! another glance may &s;et me raving!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;May?&endq; cried Lionel, laughing; &startq;why what
have you been doing all this time? However, be a
little le&s;s in the &s;ublime, and I'll introduce you to
her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible? &s;hall I owe to you &s;o cel$&s;tial
a happine&s;s? O Tyrold! you bind me to you for
life!&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel, heartily hallowing, then brought him for|ward
to Indiana: &startq;Mi&s;s Lynmere,&endq; he cried, &startq;a
fellow &s;tudent of mine, though &s;omewhat more given
to &s;tudy than your poor cou&s;in, mo&s;t humbly begs
the honour of ki&s;&s;ing your toe.&endq;</P>
<P>The uncommon lowne&s;s of the bow which the
Oxonian, ignorant of what Lionel would &s;ay, was
making, led Mi&s;s Margland to imagine he was really
going to perform that popi&s;h ceremony; and ha&s;tily
pulling Lionel by the &s;leeve, &s;he angrily &s;aid: &startq;Mr.
Lionel, I de&s;ire to know by who&s;e authority you
pre&s;ent &s;uch actor-men to a young lady under my
care.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel, almo&s;t in convul&s;ions, repeated this aloud;
and the young &s;tudent, who had ju&s;t, in a voice of
the deepe&s;t intere&s;t and re&s;pect, begun, &startq;The high
honour, madam;&endq; hearing an univer&s;al laugh from
the company, &s;topt &s;hort, utterly di&s;coneerted, and
after a few vainly &s;tammering attempts, bowed again,
and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Edgar, who in this di&s;tre&s;s, read an ingenuou&s;ne&s;s
of nature that counterpoi&s;ed its romantic enthu&s;ia&s;m,
felt for the young man, and taking Lionel by the
<PB N="123" REF="123">
arm, &s;aid: &startq;Will you not introduce me al&s;o to your
friend?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Melmond of Brazen No&s;e! Mr. Mandle|bert
of Beech Park!&endq; cried Lionel, flouri&s;hing, and
bowing from one to the other.</P>
<P>Edgar &s;hook hands with the youth, and hoped
they &s;hould be better acquainted.</P>
<P>Camilla, gliding round, whi&s;pered him: &startq;How
like my dear father was that! to give relief to em|barra&s;&s;ment,
in&s;tead of joining in the laugh which
excites it!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, touched by a compari&s;on to the per&s;on he
mo&s;t honoured, gratefully looked his acknowledg|ment;
and all di&s;plea&s;ure at her flight, even from
Thom&s;on's &s;eene of conjugal felicity, was cra&s;ed
from his mind.</P>
<P>The company grew impatient for the ra&s;&s;le,
though &s;ome of the &s;ub&s;cribers were not arrived.
It was voted, at the propo&s;ition of Mrs. Arlbery,
that the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop &s;hould repre&s;ent, as their
turns came round, tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>While this was &s;ettling, Edgar, in &s;ome confu|&s;ion,
drew Camilla to the door, &s;aying: &startq;To avoid
any perplexity about your throwing, &s;uppo&s;e you &s;tep
into the haberda&s;her's &s;hop that is over the way?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who already had felt very awkward with
re&s;pect to her withdrawn &s;ub&s;cription, gladly agreed
to the propo&s;al, and begging him to explain the
matter to Mi&s;s Margland, tript acro&s;s the &s;treet,
while the rafflers were crowding to the point of
action.</P>
<P>Here &s;he &s;at, making &s;ome &s;mall purcha&s;es, till
the bu&s;ine&s;s was over: The whole party then came
forth into the &s;treet, and all in a body poured into
the haberda&s;her's &s;hop, &s;miling, bowing, and of one
accord wi&s;hing her joy.</P>
<P>Concluding this to be in deri&s;ion of her de&s;ertion,
&s;he rallied as well as &s;he was able; but Mrs. Arl|bery,
who entered the la&s;t, and held the locket in
her hand, &s;aid: &startq;Mi&s;s Tyrold, I heartily wi&s;h you

<P>Camilla, colouring, laughing, and unwillingly
taking it, &s;aid: &startq;I &s;uppo&s;e, ma'am&mdash;I hope&mdash;it is
yours?&endq; And &s;he looked about for Edgar to a&s;&s;i&s;t
her; but, he was gone to ha&s;ten the carriage.</P>
<P>Every body crowded round her to take a la&s;t
&s;ight of the beautiful locket. Eager to get rid of it,
&s;he put it into the hands of Indiana, who regarded
it with a partiality which her numerous admirers had
courted, individually, in vain; though the young
Oxonian, by his dramatic emotions, had engaged
more of her attention than &s;he had yet be&s;towed
el&s;ewhere. Eugenia too, caught by his eccentri|city,
was powerfully impelled to watch and admire
him; and not the le&s;s, in the unenvying innocency
of her heart, for his evident predilection in favour of
her cou&s;in. This youth was not, however, &s;uffered
to engro&s;s her; the &s;tranger by whom &s;he had al|ready
been di&s;tingui&s;hed at the ball and public break|fa&s;t,
was one in the group, and re&s;umed a claim
upon her notice, too &s;lattering in its manner to be
repul&s;ed, and too new to her extreme inexperience
to be obtru&s;ive.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Camilla gathered from Major Cer|wood,
that the prize had really fallen to her lot.
Edgar had excu&s;ed her not &s;taying to throw for her|&s;elf,
but the general proxy, the book&s;eller, had been
&s;ucce&s;sful in her name.</P>
<P>In great perplexity how to account for this inci|dent,
&s;he apprehended Edgar had made &s;ome mi&s;|take,
and determined, through his means, to re&s;tore
the locket to the &s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>The carriage of Mrs. Arlbery was fir&s;t ready;
but, pu&s;hing away the throng of beaux offering a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
&s;he went up to Camilla, and &s;aid; &startq;Fair
object of the &s;pleen of all around, will you bring a
little of your influence with good fortune to my do|main,
and come and dine with me?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="125">
Delighted at the propo&s;al, Camilla looked at Mi&s;s
Margland; but Mi&s;s Margland, not being included
in the invitation, frowned a refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Edgar now entered and announced the coach of
Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>&startq;Make u&s;e of it as you can,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arl|bery;
&startq;there is room for one more to go back than
it brought; &s;o pray do the honours prettily. Cla|rendel!
take care of Mi&s;s Tyrold to my coach.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Sedley &s;miled, and played with his watch
chain, but did not move.</P>
<P>&startq;O you lazie&s;t of all lazy wretchee!&endq; cried Mrs.
Arlbery</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall rever&s;e the epithet, and be the alerte&s;t
of the alert,&endq; &s;aid Major Corwood; &startq;if the com|mi&s;&s;ion
may be devolved to my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Po&s;itively not for the world! there is nothing
&s;o plea&s;ant as working the indolent; except, indeed,
making the re&s;tle&s;s keep quiet; &s;o, come forth, Cla|rendel!
be civil, and &s;trike us all with a&s;toni&s;hment!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My adored Mrs. Arlbery!&endq; cried he, (hoi&s;t|ing
him&s;elf upon the &s;hop counter, and &s;winging a
&s;witch to and fro, with a languid motion,) your
maxims are all of the fir&s;t &s;uperlative, except this;
but nobody's civil now, you know: 'tis a &s;ogramity
quite out.'&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So you ab&s;olutely won't &s;tir, then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O pray! pray!&endq; an&s;wered he, putting on his
hat and folding his arms, &startq;a little mercy! 'tis &s;o
va&s;tly in&s;ufferably hot! Calcutta mu&s;t be in the
frigid zone to this &s;hop! a very ice-hou&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who never imagined rudene&s;s could make
a feature of affectation, internally attributed this re|fu&s;al
to his pique that &s;he had di&s;regarded him at the
public breakfa&s;t, and would have made him &s;ome
apology, but knew not in what manner to word it.</P>
<P>The Major again came forward, but Mi&s;s Mar|gland,
advancing al&s;o, &s;aid: &startq; Mi&s;s Camilla! you
won't think of dining out unknown to Sir Hugh?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;ure,&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;you will
have the goodne&s;s to &s;peak for me to Sir Hugh.&endq;
<PB N="126" REF="126">
Then, turning to Lionel, &startq;Mr. Tyrold,&endq; &s;he added,
you mu&s;t go with us, that you may conduct your
&s;i&s;ter &s;afe home Don't be affronted; I &s;hall invite
you for your own &s;ake another time. Come, you
abominable Clarendel! awake! and give a little
&s;pring to our motions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are mo&s;t incommodiou&s;ly cruel!&endq; an&s;wer|ed
he; &startq;but I am bound to be your &s;lave.&endq; Then
calling to one of the apprentices in the &s;hop; &startq;My
va&s;tly good boy,&endq; he cried &startq;do you want to &s;ee me
irrecoverably &s;ubdued by this immen&s;ely inhuman
heat?&endq;</P>
<P>The boy &s;tared; and &s;aid, &startq;Sir.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If not, do get me a gla&s;s of water.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O wor&s;e and wor&s;e!&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery;
&startq;your whims are in&s;upportable. I give you up!
Major! advance.&endq;</P>
<P>The Major, with alacrity, offered his hand; Ca|milla
he&s;itated; &s;he wi&s;hed pa&s;&s;ionately to go, yet
felt &s;he had no authority for &s;uch a mea&s;ure. The
name, though not the per&s;on of Mrs. Arlbery, was
known both at Cleves and at Etherington, as be|longing
to the owner of a capital hou&s;e in the neigh|bourhood;
and though the invitation was without
form, Camilla was too young to be with-held by ce|remony.
Her uncle, &s;he was &s;ure, could refu&s;e her
nothing; and &s;he thought, as &s;he was only a vi&s;itor
at Cleves, Mi&s;s Margland had no right to control
her; the plea&s;ure, therefore, of the &s;cheme, &s;oon
conquered every &s;maller difficulty, and, looking away
from her party, &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be led to the
coach.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;aid aloud: &startq;Re|member!
I give no con&s;ent to this!&endq;</P>
<P>But Eugenia, on the other &s;ide, whi&s;pered:
&startq;Don't be unea&s;y; I will explain to my uncle how
it all happened.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was following, when Indiana ex|claimed:
&startq;Cou&s;in Camilla, what am I to do with
your locket?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="127">
Camilla had wholly forgotten it; &s;he called to
Edgar, who &s;lowly, and with a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s very un|u&s;ual,
obeyed her &s;ummons.</P>
<P>&startq;There has been &s;ome great mi&s;take,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,
&startq;about the locket. I &s;uppo&s;e they neglected to
&s;cratch out my name from the &s;ub&s;cription; for
Major Cerwood &s;ays it really came to me. Will you
be &s;o good as to return it to the book&s;eller?&endq;</P>
<P>The gravity of Edgar immediately vani&s;hed:
&startq;Are you &s;o ready,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;even when it is in
your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to part with &s;o pretty a trinket?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You know it cannot be mine, for here is my
half guinea.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery then got into the coach; but Ca|milla,
&s;till farther recollecting her&s;elf, again called
to Edgar, and holding out the half guinea, &s;aid:
&startq;How &s;hall I get this to the poor people?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They were to come,&endq; he an&s;wered, &startq;to Cleves
this afternoon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Will you, then, give it them for me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No commi&s;&s;ion to Mr. Mandlebert!&endq; inter|rupted
Mrs. Arlbery; &startq;for he mu&s;t po&s;itively dine
with us.&endq;</P>
<P>Mandlebert bowed a plea&s;ed a&s;&s;ent, and Camilla
applied to Eugenia; but Mi&s;s Margland, in deep
wrath, refu&s;ed to let her move a &s;tep.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery then ordered the coach to drive
home. Camilla, begging a moment'&punc; delay, de&s;ired
Edgar to approach nearer, and &s;aid, in a low voice,
&startq;I cannot bear to let tho&s;e poor expectants toll &s;o
far for nothing. I will &s;ooner go back to Cleves
my&s;elf. I &s;hall not &s;leep all night if I di&s;appoint
them. Pray, invent &s;ome excu&s;e for me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you have &s;et your heart upon this vi&s;it,&endq; an|&s;wered
Mandlebert, with vivacity, though in a whi&s;|per,
&startq;I will ride over my&s;elf to Cleves, and arrange
all to your wi&s;hes; but if not, certainly there can
need no invention, to decline an invitation of which
Sir Hugh has no knowledge.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who at the beginning of this &s;peech felt
the highe&s;t glee, &s;unk involuntarily at its conclu&s;ion,
<PB N="128" REF="128">
and turning with a blank countenance to Mrs. Arl|bery,
&s;tammeringly &s;aid; &startq;Can you, will you&mdash;be
&s;o very good, as not to take it ill if I don't go with
you?&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, &s;urpri&s;ed, very coldly an&s;wered:
&startq;Certainly not! I would be no re&s;traint upon you.
I hate re&s;traint my&s;elf.&endq; She then ordered the foot|man
to open the door; and Camilla, too much
aba&s;hed to offer any apology, was handed out by
Edgar.</P>
<P>&startq;Amiable Camilla!&endq; &s;aid he, in conducting her
back to Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;this is a &s;elf-conque&s;t that
I alone, perhaps, expected from you!&endq;</P>
<P>Cheared by &s;uch approbation, &s;he forgot her di&s;|appointment,
and regardle&s;s of Mi&s;s Margland and
her ill humour, jumped into her uncle's coach, and
was the gaye&s;t of the party that returned to Cleves.</P>
<P>Edgar took the locket from Indiana, and promi&s;ed
to rectify the mi&s;take; and then, le&s;t Mrs. Arlbery
&s;hould be offended with them all, rode to her hou&s;e
without any fre&s;h invitation, accompanied by Lionel;
who&s;e anger again&s;t Camilla, for &s;uffering Mi&s;s Mar|gland
to gain a victory, was his theme the whole
ride.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Baru.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t care of Camilla was to intere&s;t Sir Hugh
in the misfortunes of the pri&s;oner and his family;
her next, to relate the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery,
and to beg permi&s;&s;ion that &s;he might wait upon that
lady the next morning, with apologies for her abrupt
retreat, and with acknowledgments for the &s;ervices
done to the poor woman; which fir&s;t the Oxonian,
and then the raffle, had driven from her mind. Sir
Hugh readily con&s;ented, blaming her for &s;uppo&s;ing
<PB N="129" REF="129">
it po&s;&s;ible he could ever he&s;itate in what could give
her any plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Before the tea-party broke up, Edgar returned.
He told Camilla he had &s;tolen away the in&s;tant din|ner
was over, to avoid any mi&s;take about the poor
people, whom he had ju&s;t overtaken by the park|gate,
and conducted to the great barn, where he had
$$ected them to wait for orders.</P>
<P>&startq;I'll run to them immediately,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;for
my half guin$a is in an agony to be gone!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The barn! my dear young Mr. Mandlebert!&endq;
exclaimed Sir Hugh; &startq;and why did you not bring
them to the &s;ervants' hall? My little girl has been
telling me all their hi&s;tory; and, God forbid, I &s;hould
turn hard-hearted, becau&s;e of their wanting a leg of
mutton, in preference to being &s;tarved; though they
might have no great right to it, according to the
forms of law; which, however, is not much impedi|ment
to the calls of nature, when a man &s;ees a but|cher's
&s;tall well covered, and has got nothing within
him, except his own poor craving appetite; which
is a thing I always take into con&s;ideration; though,
God forbid, I &s;hould protect a thief, no man's pro|perty
being another's, whether he's poor or rich.&endq;</P>
<P>He then gave Camilla three guineas to deliver to
them from him&s;elf, to &s;et them a little a-going in an
hone&s;t way, that they might not, he &s;aid, repent
leaving off bad actions. Her joy was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive,
that &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately embraced his knees: and Edgar,
while he looked on, could nearly have bent to her his
own, with admiration of her generous nature. Eu|genia
de&s;ired to accompany her; and Indiana, ri&s;ing
al&s;o, &s;aid: &startq;Dear! I wonder how they will look
in the barn! I &s;hould like to &s;ee them too.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland made no oppo&s;ition, and they &s;et
out.</P>
<P>Camilla, leading the way, with a fleetne&s;s that
mocked all equality, ran into the barn, and &s;aw the
whole party, according to their &s;everal powers, en|joying
them&s;elves. The poor man, &s;tretched upon
&s;traw, was re&s;ting his aching limbs; his wife, by his
<PB N="130" REF="130">
&s;ide, was giving nouri&s;hment to her baby; and the
other child, a little boy of three years old, was
jumping and turning head over heels, with the true
glee of un&s;poilt nature, &s;uperior to poverty and
di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>To the gay heart of Camilla whatever was &s;portive
was attractive; &s;he flew to the little fellow, who&s;e
&s;kin was clean and bright, in the mid&s;t of his rags
and wretchedne&s;s, and, making her&s;elf his play|mate,
bid the woman fini&s;h feeding her child, told
the man to repo&s;e him&s;elf undi&s;turbed, and began
dancing with the little boy, not le&s;s delighted than
him&s;elf at the fe&s;tive exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland ca&s;t up her hands and eyes as &s;he
entered, and poured forth a warm remon&s;trance
again&s;t &s;o demeaning a conde&s;cen&s;ion: but Camilla,
in who&s;e compo&s;ition pride had no &s;hare, though
&s;pirit was a principal ingredient, danced on unheed|ing,
to the equal amaze and enchantment of the poor
man and woman, at the honour done to their little
&s;on.</P>
<P>Edgar came in la&s;t; he had given his arm to Eu|genia,
who was always in the rear if una&s;&s;i&s;ted. Mi&s;s
Margland appealed to him upon the impropriety of
the behaviour of Camilla, adding, &startq;If I had had
the bringing up a young lady who could &s;o degrade
her&s;elf, I prote&s;t I &s;hould blu&s;h to &s;how my face: but
you cannot, I am &s;ure, fail remarking the difference
of Mi&s;s Lynmere's conduct.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar attended with an air of complacency, which
he thought due to the &s;ituation of Mi&s;s Margland in
the family, yet kept his eyes fixt upon Camilla, with
an expre&s;&s;ion that, to the la&s;t di&s;cernment, would
have evinced his utmo&s;t approbation of her innocent
gaiety: but Mi&s;s Margland was among&s;t that nu|merous
tribe, who, content as well as occupied with
making ob&s;ervations upon others, have neither the
power, nor thought, of developing tho&s;e that are re|turned
upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Camilla at length, wholly out of breath, gave
over; but perceiving that the baby was no longer at
<PB N="131" REF="131">
its mother's brea&s;t, flew to the poor woman, and,
taking the child in her arms, &s;aid: &startq;Come, I can
nur&s;e and $e&s;t at the &s;ame time; I a&s;&s;ure you the
baby will be &s;afe with me, for I nur&s;e all the children
in our neighbourhood.&endq; She then fondled the poor
little half-&s;tarved child to her bo&s;om, quieting, and
ki&s;&s;ing, and cooing over it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland was &s;till more incen&s;ed; but Edgar
could attend to her no longer. Charmed with the
youthful nur&s;e, and &s;eeing in her unaffected attitudes,
a thou&s;and graces he had never before remarked, and
reading in her fondne&s;s for children the genuine
&s;weetne&s;s of her character, he could not bear to
have the plea&s;ing reflections revolving in his mind in|terrupted
by the &s;pleen of Mi&s;s Margland, and, &s;lip|ping
away, po&s;ted him&s;elf behind the baby's father,
where he could look on undi&s;turbed; certain it was a
vicinity to which Mi&s;s Margland would not follow
him.</P>
<P>Had this &s;cene la&s;ted till Camilla was tired, its
period would not have been very &s;hort; but Mi&s;s
Margland, finding her exhortations vain, &s;uddenly
called out: &startq;Mi&s;s Lynmere! Mi&s;s Eugenia! come
away directly! It's ten to one but the&s;e people have
all got the gaol di&s;temper!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, quick as lightning at this &s;ound, flew to
Camilla, and &s;natched the child from her arms. In|diana,
with a &s;cream, ran out of the barn; Mi&s;s
Margland hurried after; and Eugenia, following,
earne&s;tly intreated Camilla not to &s;tay another mo|ment.</P>
<P>&startq;And what is there to be alarmed at?&endq; cried &s;he;
&startq;I always nur&s;e poor children when I &s;ee them at
home; and my father never prohibits me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There may be &s;ome rea&s;on, however,&endq; &s;aid
Edgar, while &s;till he tenderly held the baby him&s;elf,
&startq;for the pre&s;ent apprehen&s;ion: I beg you, there|fore,
to ha&s;ten away.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At lea&s;t,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;before I depart, let me
execute my commi&s;&s;ion.&endq; And then, with the kinde&s;t
good wi&s;hes for their better fortune, &s;he put her
<PB N="132" REF="132">
uncle's three guineas into the hands of the poor man,
and her own re&s;cued half guinea into tho&s;e of his
wife: and, de&s;iring Edgar not to remain him&s;elf
where he would not &s;uffer her to &s;tay, ran to give her
arm to Eugenia; leaving it a doubtful point, whether
the good humour accompanying her alms, made the
mo&s;t plea&s;ed impre&s;&s;ion upon their receivers, or upon
their ob&s;erver.</P>

an&s;wer to-morrow evening.</P>
<P>&startq;This, Sir,&endq; continued Mi&s;s Margland, when
Sir Hugh had read the letter; &startq;this is the exact
conduct of a gentleman; all open, all re&s;pectful. No
attempt at any clande&s;tine intercour&s;e. All is ad|dre&s;&s;ed
where it ought to be, to the per&s;on mo&s;t pro|per
to &s;uperintend &s;uch an affair. This is that very
&s;ame gentleman who&s;e politene&s;s I mentioned to you,
and who danced with Mi&s;s Eugenia at Northwick,
when nobody el&s;e took any notice of her. This
is&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why then this is one of the mo&s;t untoward
things,&endq; cried Sir Hugh, who, vainly waiting for a
pau&s;e, began to &s;peak without one, &startq;that has ever
come to bear; for where's the u&s;e of Eugenia's mak|ing
poor young fellows fall in love with her for no|thing?
which I hold to be a pity, provided it's &s;in|cere,
which I take for granted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to that, Sir, I can't &s;ay I &s;ee the rea&s;on why
Mi&s;s Eugenia &s;hould not be allowed to look about
her, and have &s;ome choice; e&s;pecially as the young
gentleman abroad has no fortune; at lea&s;t none an|&s;werable
to her expectations.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="134">
&startq;But that's the very rea&s;on for my marrying them
together. For as he has not had the &s;mall-pox him|&s;elf,
that is, not in the natural way; which, Lord
help me! I thought the be&s;t, owing to my want of
knowledge; why he'll the more readily excu&s;e her
face not being one of the prettie&s;t, for her kindne&s;s
in putting up with his having &s;o little money; being
a thing &s;ome people think a good deal of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But, Sir, won't it be very hard upon poor Mi&s;s
Eugenia, if a better offer &s;hould come, that &s;he mu&s;t
not li&s;ten to it, only becau&s;e of a per&s;on &s;he has never
&s;een, though he has no e&s;tate?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mrs. Margland,&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh, (with &s;ome
heat,) &startq;this is the very thing that I would &s;ooner
have given a crown than have had happen! Who
knows but Eugenia may take a fancy to this young
jackanapes? who, for aught I know, may be as good
a man as another, for which I beg his pardon; but,
as he is nothing to me, and my nephew's my nephew,
why&punc; am I to have the be&s;t &s;cheme I ever made
knocked on the head, for a per&s;on I had as lieve were
twitched into the Red-Sea? which, however, is a
thing I &s;hould not &s;ay, being what I would not do.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland took from her pocket the letter de|&s;igned
for Eugenia, and was going to break the &s;eal;
but Sir Hugh, preventing her, &s;aid: &startq;No, Mi&s;s
Margland; Eugenia &s;hall read her own letters. I
have not had her taught all this time, by one of the
fir&s;t &s;cholars of the age, as far as I can tell, to put
that affront upon her.&endq;</P>
<P>He then rang the bell, and &s;ent for Eugenia.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland &s;tated the utter impropriety of &s;uf|fering
any young lady to read a letter of that &s;ort,
till propo&s;als had been laid before her parents and
guardians. But Si$ Hugh &s;poke no more till Eu|genia
appeared.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear,&endq; he then &s;aid, &startq;here is a letter ju&s;t
come to put your education to the trial; which, I
make no doubt, will &s;tand the te&s;t properly: there|fore,
in regard to the an&s;wer, you &s;hall write it all
your&s;elf, being qualified in a manner to which I have
<PB N="135" REF="135">
no right to pretend; though I &s;hall go to-morrow to
my brother, which will give me a better in&s;ight; his
head being one of the be&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, opened the letter, and
read it with vi&s;ible emotion.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear, and what do you &s;ay to it?&endq;</P>
<P>Without an&s;wering, &s;he read it again.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh repeated the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, Sir,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, (in a tone of &s;adne&s;s,)
&startq;it is &s;omething that afflicts me very much!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lord help us!&endq; cried Sir Hugh, &startq;this comes
of going to a ball! which, begging Mi&s;s Margland's
pardon, is the la&s;t time it &s;hall be done.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland was beginning a vehement defence
of her&s;elf; but Sir Hugh interrupted it, by de&s;iring
to &s;ee the letter.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with increa&s;ed confu&s;ion. folded it up,
and &s;aid: &startq;Indeed, Sir&mdash;Indeed, uncle&mdash;it is a very
improper letter for me to &s;hew.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, that,&endq; cried Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;is a thing
I could never have imagined! that a gentleman, who
is &s;o much the gentleman, &s;hould write an improper
letter!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no,&endq; interrupted &s;he, &startq;not improper&mdash;
perhaps&mdash;for him to write&mdash;but for me to exhibit.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, if that's all, my dear,&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh, &startq;if
it's only becau&s;e of a few compliments, I beg you
not to mind them, becau&s;e of their having no mean|ing;
which is a thing common enough in the way of
making love, by what I hear; though &s;uch a young
thing as you can know nothing of the matter, your
learning not going in that line; nor Dr. Orkborne's
neither, if one may judge; which, God forbid I
&s;hould find fault with, being no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine.&endq;</P>
<P>He then again a&s;ked to &s;ee the letter; and Eu|genia,
a&s;hamed to refu&s;e, gave it, and went out of
the room.</P>

<P>THE delicacy of your highly cultivated mind awes
even the violent pa&s;&s;ion which you in&s;pire. And to

think I pre&s;umed too far, upon an acquaintance, to
my unhappine&s;s, &s;o &s;hort; yet, as I feel it to have
excited in me the mo&s;t la&s;ting attachment, from my

endure to run the ri&s;k of incurring your aver&s;ion.
Allow me then, once more, under the &s;anction of
that excellent lady in who&s;e care I have had the ho|nour

that I may be graced with your own commands about

<P>Sir Hugh, when he had fini&s;hed the letter, heaved
a &s;igh, and leant his head upon his hand, con&s;idering
whether or not to let it be &s;een by Mi&s;s Margland;
who, however, not feeling &s;ecure what his deter|mination
might be, had &s;o contrived to &s;it at the
table as to read it at the &s;ame time with him&s;elf. Nor
had &s;he weighed the intere&s;t of her curio&s;ity ami&s;s;
<PB N="137" REF="137">
Sir Hugh, dreading a debate with her, &s;oon put the
letter into his pocket-book, and again &s;ent for Eu|genia.</P>
<P>Eugenia excu&s;ed her&s;elf from returning, pleaded
a head-ache, and went to bed.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was in the deepe&s;t alarm; though the
evening was far advanced, he could &s;carce refrain
from going to Etherington directly; he ordered his
carriage to be at the door at eight o'clock the next
morning; and &s;ent a &s;econd order, a moment after,
that it &s;hould not be later than half pa&s;t &s;even.</P>
<P>He then &s;ummoned Camilla, and, giving her the
letter, bid her run with it to her &s;i&s;ter, for fear it was
that &s;he was fretting for. And &s;oon after, he went
to bed that he might be ready in the morning.</P>
<P>Eugenia, meanwhile, felt the placid compo&s;ure of
her mind now for the fir&s;t time &s;haken. The a&s;&s;i|duities
of this young man had already plea&s;ed and
intere&s;ted her; but, though gratified by them in
his pre&s;ence, they occurred to her no more in his
ab&s;ence. With the Oxonian &s;he had been far more
&s;truck; his energy, his &s;entiments, his pa&s;&s;ion for
literature, would in&s;tantly have riveted him in her
faire&s;t favour, had &s;he not &s;o completely regarded
her&s;elf as the wife of Clermont Lynmere, that &s;he
denied her imagination any power over her rea&s;on.</P>
<P>This letter, however, filled her with &s;en&s;ations
wholly new. She now fir&s;t reflected &s;eriou&s;ly upon
the nature of her &s;ituation with regard to Clermont,
for whom &s;he &s;eemed be&s;poke by her uncle, without
the &s;malle&s;t knowledge how they might approve or
&s;uit each other. Perhaps he might di&s;like her; &s;he
mu&s;t then have the mortification of being refu&s;ed:
perhaps he might excite her own antipathy; &s;he
mu&s;t then either di&s;appoint her uncle, or become a
mi&s;erable &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Here, on the contrary, &s;he conceived her&s;elf an
elected object. The difference of being accepted,
or being cho&s;en, worked forcibly upon her mind;
and, all that was delicate, feminine, or dignified in
her notions, ro&s;e in favour of him who &s;ought, when
<PB N="138" REF="138">
oppo&s;ed to him who could only con&s;ent to receive
her. Generous, too, he appeared to her, in for|bearing
to apply to Sir Hugh, without her permi&s;|&s;ion:
di&s;intere&s;ted, in declaring he did not wi&s;h for
her hand without her heart; and noble, in not &s;eek|ing
her in a clande&s;tine manner, but referring every
thing to Mi&s;s Margland.</P>
<P>The idea al&s;o of exciting an ardent pa&s;&s;ion, lo&s;t
none of its force from its novelty to her expectations.
It was not that &s;he had hitherto &s;uppo&s;ed it impo&s;|&s;ible;
&s;he had done le&s;s; &s;he had not thought of it
at all. Nor came it now with any triumph to her
mode&s;t and una&s;&s;uming mind; all it brought with it
was gratitude towards B$llamy, and a &s;omething
&s;oothing towards her&s;elf, which, though inexplica|ble
to her rea&s;on, was irre&s;i&s;tible to her feelings.</P>
<P>When Camilla entered with the letter, &s;he ba&s;h|fully
a&s;ked her, if &s;he wi&s;hed to read it? Camilla
eagerly cried: &startq;O, yes.&endq; But, having fini&s;hed
it, &s;aid: &startq;It is not &s;uch a letter as Edgar Mandle|bert
would have written.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;ure, then,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, colouring,
&startq;I am &s;orry to have received it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you not ob&s;erve every day,&endq; &s;aid Camilla,
&startq;the di&s;tance, the delicacy of his behaviour to In|diana,
though Mi&s;s Margland &s;ays their marriage is
fixed; how free from all di&s;tinction that might con|fu&s;e
her? This declaration, on the contrary, is &s;o
abrupt&mdash;and from &s;o new an acquaintance&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Certainly, then, I won't an&s;wer it,&endq; &s;aid Eu|genia,
much di&s;compo&s;ed; &startq;it had not &s;truck me
thus at fir&s;t reading; but I &s;ee now all its im|propriety.&endq;</P>
<P>She then bid good night to Camilla; who, con|cluding
her the appropriated wife of Clermont, had
uttered her opinion without &s;cruple.</P>
<P>Eugenia now again read the letter; but not again
with plea&s;ure. She thought it forward and pre|&s;umptuous:
and the only gratification that remained
upon her mind, was an half con&s;cious, &s;carce ad|mitted,
and, even to her&s;elf, unacknowledged
<PB N="139" REF="139">
charm, in a belief, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power to

<P>MR. and Mrs. Tyrold and Lavinia were at break|fa&s;t
when Sir Hugh entered their parlour, the next
morning. &startq;Brother,&endq; he cried, &startq;I have &s;omething
of great importance to tell you, which it is very fit
my &s;i&s;ter &s;hould hear too; for which rea&s;on, I make
no doubt but my dear Lavinia's good &s;en&s;e will leave
the room without waiting for a hint.&endq;</P>
<P>Lavinia in&s;tantly retired.</P>
<P>&startq;O, my dear brother,&endq; continued the baronet;
&startq;do you know here's a young chap, who appears to
be a rather good &s;ort of man, which is &s;o much the
wor&s;e, who has been falling in love with Eugenia?&endq;</P>
<P>He then delivered the two letters to Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>&startq;Now the only thing that hurts me in this bu|&s;ine&s;s
is, that this young man, who Mi&s;s Margland
calls a per&s;on of fa&s;hion, writes as well as Clermont
would do him&s;elf; though that is what I &s;hall never
own to Eugenia, which I hope is no &s;in, being all
for her own &s;ake; that is to &s;ay, for Clermont's.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, after attentively reading the letters,
gave them to his wife, and made many inquiries con|cerning
their writer, and his acquaintance with Eu|genia
and Mi&s;s Margland.</P>
<P>&startq;Why it was all brought about,&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh,
&startq;by their going to a ball and a public breakfa&s;t;
which is a thing my little Camilla is not at all to
blame for, becau&s;e if nobody had put it in her head,
&s;he would not have known there was a thing of the
kind. And, indeed, it was but natural in poor
Lionel neither, to &s;et her agog, the chief fault lying
in the a&s;&s;izes; to which my particular objection is
<PB N="140" REF="140">
again&s;t the lawyers, who come into a town to hang
and tran&s;port the poor, by way of keeping the peace,
and then encourage the rich to make all the noi&s;e and
riot they can, by their own junkettings; for which,
however, being generally, I believe, pretty good
&s;cholars, I make no doubt but they have their own
rea&s;ons.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I flatter my&s;elf,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold, &s;carce
deigning to fini&s;h the letters, &startq;Eugenia, young as &s;he
is, will need no coun&s;el how to e&s;timate a writer &s;uch
as this. What mu&s;t the man be, who, pre&s;uming
upon his per&s;onal influence, ventures to claim her
concurrence in an application to her friends, though
he has &s;een her but twice, and knows her to be de&s;|titute
of the &s;malle&s;t knowledge of his principles, his
character, or his &s;ituation in life?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Good lack!&endq; cried the baronet, &startq;what a pro|digious
poor head I mu&s;t have! here I could hardly
&s;leep all night, for thinking what a fine letter this
jackanapes, which I &s;hall make no more apology for
calling him, had been writing, fearing it would cut
up poor Clermont in her opinion, for all his grand
tour.&endq;</P>
<P>Perfectly re&s;tored to ea&s;e, he now bad them good
morning; but Mr. Tyrold intreated him to &s;tay till
they had &s;ettled how to get rid of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear brother,&endq; he an&s;wered, &startq;I want no
more help now, &s;ince I have got your opinion, that
is, my &s;i&s;ter's, which I take it for granted is the &s;ame.
I make no doubt but Eugenia will pretty near have
writ her foul copy by the time I get home, which
Dr. Orkborne may overlook for her, to the end that
this Mr. Up&s;tart may have no more fault to find
again&s;t it.&endq;</P>
<P>They both de&s;ired to dine at Cleves, that they
might &s;peak them&s;elves with Eugenia.</P>
<P>&startq;And how,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold, with a &s;trong &s;e|cret
emotion, &startq;how goes on Edgar with Indiana?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Va&s;tly well, va&s;tly well indeed! not that I pre|tend
to &s;peak for my&s;elf, being rather too dull
in the&s;e matters, owing to never entering upon them
<PB N="141" REF="141">
in the right &s;ea&s;on, as I intend to tell other young
men doing the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P>He then, in warm terms, narrated the accounts
given him by Mi&s;s Margland of the &s;ecurity of the
conque&s;t of Indiana.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold fixed his hour for expecting the car|riage,
and the baronet de&s;ired that Lavinia &s;hould
be of the party; &startq;becau&s;e,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;I &s;ee &s;he
has the proper di&s;cretion, when &s;he is wanted to go
out of the way; which mu&s;t be the &s;ame with Ca|milla
and Indiana, too, to-day, as well as with young
Mr. Edgar; for I don't think it prudent to tru&s;t
&s;uch new beginners with every thing that goes on,
till they get a little older.&endq;</P>
<P>The anxiety of Mr. Tyrold, concerning Bellamy,
was now mingled with a cruel regret in relation to
Mandlebert. Even his own upright conduct could
&s;carce con&s;ole him for the lo&s;s of his favourite hope,
and he almo&s;t repented that he had not been more
active in endeavouring to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>All that pa&s;&s;ed in his mind was read and partici|pated
in by his faithful partner, who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure
was greater, though her mortification could but be
equal. &startq;That Edgar,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;&s;hould have kept
his heart wholly untouched, would le&s;s have moved
my wonder; he has a peculiar, though uncon&s;cious
delicacy in his nature, which re&s;ults not from in&s;o|lence
nor pre&s;umption, but from his own invariable
and familiar exerci&s;e of every virtue and of every
duty: the &s;malle&s;t deviation is offen&s;ive, and even
the lea&s;t inaccuracy is painful to him. Was it po&s;&s;ible,
then, to be prepared for &s;uch an election as this?
He has di&s;graced my expectations; he has played
the common part of a mere common young man,
who&s;e eye is his &s;ole governor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My Georgina,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold, &startq;I am deeply
di&s;appointed. Our two elde&s;t girls are but &s;lightly
provided for; and Eugenia is far more dangerou&s;ly
circum&s;tanced, in &s;tanding &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly apart, as
a prize to &s;ome adventurer. One of the&s;e three pre|cious
cares I had fondly concluded certain of pro|tection
<PB N="142" REF="142">
and happine&s;s; for which ever I might have
be&s;towed upon Edgar Mandlebert, I &s;hould have
con&s;idered as the mo&s;t fortunate of her &s;ex. Let us,
however, rejoice for Indiana; no one can more need
a protector; and, next to my own three gi$ls, there
is no one for whom I am &s;o much intere&s;ted. I grieve,
however, for Edgar him&s;elf, who&s;e excellent judgment
will, in time, a&s;&s;ert its rights, though pa&s;&s;ion, at this
period, has &s;et it a&s;ide.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am too angry with him for pity,&endq; &s;aid Mrs.
Tyrold; &startq;nor is his under&s;tanding of a cla&s;s that
has any claim to &s;uch lenity: I had often thought
our gentle Lavinia almo&s;t born to be his wife, and no
one could more truly have de&s;erved him. But the
&s;oft perfection of her character relieves me from any
apprehen&s;ion for her conduct, and almo&s;t all my &s;o|licitude
devolves upon Camilla. For our poor Eu|genia
I had never indulged a hope of his choice;
though that valuable, unfortunate girl, with every
unearned defect about her, intrin&s;ically merits him,
with all his advantages, his accompli&s;hments, and his
virtnes: but to appreciate her, uninfluenced by pe|cuniary
views, to which he is every way &s;uperior, was
too much to expect from &s;o young a man. My
wi&s;hes, therefore, had guided him to our Camilla,
that &s;weet, open, generous, incon&s;iderate girl, who&s;e
feelings are all virtues, but who&s;e impul&s;es have no
re&s;traints: I have not a fear for her, when &s;he can
act with deliberation; but fear is almo&s;t all I have
left, when I con&s;ider her as led by the &s;tart of the
moment. With him, however, &s;he would have been
the &s;afe&s;t, and with him&mdash;next alone to her mother,
the happie&s;t of her &s;ex.&endq;</P>
<P>The kinde&s;t acknowledgments repaid this &s;ym|pathy
of &s;entiment, and they agreed that their felicity
would have been almo&s;t too complete for this lower
world, if &s;uch an event had come to pa&s;s. &startq;Never|thele&s;s
its failure,&endq; added Mrs. Tyrold, &startq;is almo&s;t
incredible, and wholly unpardonable. That Indiana
&s;hould $anqui&s;h where Lavinia and Camilla have
<PB N="143" REF="143">
failed! I feel indignant at &s;uch a triumph of mere
external unintelligent beauty.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia received her parents with the mo&s;t ba&s;h|ful
confu&s;ion; yet they found, upon conver&s;ing with
her, it was merely from youthful &s;hame, and not
from any dangerous prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The ob&s;ervations
of Camilla had broken that &s;pell with which a fir&s;t
declaration of regard is apt to entangle unreflecting
inexperience; and by teaching her to le&s;s value the
votary, had made the conque&s;t le&s;s an object of &s;ati&s;|faction.
She was gratified by the permi&s;&s;ion of her
uncle to write her own an&s;wer, which was now pro|duced.</P>

<P>Mr. Tyrold, who delighted to &s;ee how completely,
in her &s;tudies with Dr. Orkborne, &s;he had e&s;caped any
pedantry or affectation, and even pre&s;erved all the
native humility of her artle&s;s character, returned her
the letter with an affectionate embrace, and told her
he could de&s;ire no alteration but that of omitting the
word <HI>grateful</HI> at the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold was far le&s;s &s;atisfied. She wi&s;hed it
to be completely re-written; prote&s;ting, that a man
<PB N="144" REF="144">
who, in all probability, was a mere fortune-hunter,
would infer from &s;o gentle a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion encouragement
rather than repul&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh &s;aid there was one thing only he de|&s;ired
to have added, which was a hint of a pre|engagement
with a relation of her own.</P>
<P>Eugenia, at this, coloured and retreated; and
Mrs. Tyrold reminded the baronet, with &s;ome di&s;|plea&s;ure,
of his promi&s;e to guard the &s;ecret of his

broke out from him but by accident, which he would
take care &s;hould never get the upper hand again. He
would not, however, con&s;ent to have the letter al|tered,
which he &s;aid would be an a&s;&s;ront to the learn|ing
of Eugenia, unle&s;s it were done by Dr. Ork|borne
him&s;elf, who, being her ma&s;ter, had a right to
correct her fir&s;t penman&s;hip.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, being called upon, &s;lightly glanced
his eye over the letter, but made no emendation,
&s;aying: &startq;I believe it will do very &s;ufficiently; but
I have only concerned my&s;elf with the progre&s;s of
Mi&s;s Eugenia in the Greek and Latin languages;
any body can teach her Engli&s;h.&endq;</P>
<P>The fond parents fini&s;hed their vi&s;it in full &s;ati&s;|faction
with their irreproachable Eugenia, and with
the joy of &s;eeing their darling Camilla as happy and
as di&s;engaged as when &s;he had left them; but Man|dlebert
had &s;pent the day abroad, and e&s;caped, there|fore,
the ob&s;ervations with which they had meant to
have inve&s;tigated his &s;entiments. Indiana, with
whom they conver&s;ed more than u&s;ual, and with the
mo&s;t &s;crutinizing attention, offered nothing either in
manner or matter or re&s;cue his deci&s;ion from their
cen&s;ure: Mrs. Tyrold, therefore, rejoiced at his ab|&s;ence,
le&s;t a coolne&s;s &s;he knew not how to repre&s;s,
&s;hould have led him to &s;urmi&s;e her di&s;appointment.
Her hu&s;band be&s;ought her to be guarded: &startq;We
had no right,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;to the di&s;po&s;al of his
heart: and Indiana, however he may find her in|adequate
to his future expectations, will not di&s;grace
his pre&s;ent choice. She is beautiful, &s;he is young,
<PB N="145" REF="145">
and &s;he is innocent; this in early life is &s;ufficient for
felicity; and Edgar is yet too new in the world to
be aware how much of life remains when youth is
gone, and too unpracti&s;ed to fore&s;ee, that beauty
lo&s;es its power even before it lo&s;es its charms, and
that the &s;ea&s;on of declining nature &s;ighs deeply for
the &s;upport which &s;ympathy and intelligence can
alone be&s;tow.&endq;</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Explication.</HEAD>
<P>THE vi&s;it which Camilla had de&s;igned this morn|ing
to Mrs. Arlbery, &s;he had been induced to relin|qui&s;h
through a &s;peech made to her by Lionel. &startq;You
have done for your&s;elf, now!&endq; &s;aid he, exultingly;
&startq;&s;o you may be governed by that &s;care-crow, Mi&s;s
Margland, at your lei&s;ure. Do you know you were
not once mentioned again at the Grove, neither by
Mrs. Arlbery nor any body el&s;e? and they all agreed
Indiana was the $ine$l girl in the world.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, though of the &s;ame opinion with re&s;pect
to Indiana, concluded Mrs. Arlbery was offended by
her retreat, and lo&s;t all courage for offering any
apology.</P>
<P>Edgar did not return to Cleves till &s;ome time after
the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold, when he met
Mi&s;s Margland and the young ladies &s;trolling in the
park.</P>
<P>Camilla, running to meet him, a&s;ked if he had re|&s;tored
the locket to the right owner.</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; an&s;wered he, &s;miling, &startq;not yet.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What can be done then? my half guinea is
gone; and, to confe&s;s the truth, I have no another
I can well &s;pare!&endq;</P>
<P>He made no immediate reply; but after &s;peaking
to the re&s;t of the party, walked on towards the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="146">
Camilla, in &s;ome perplexity, following him, ex|claimed:
&startq;Pray tell me what I mu&s;t do? indeed I
am quite unea&s;y.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You would really have me give the locket to its
rightful proprietor?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To be $ure I would!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My commi&s;&s;ion, then, is &s;oon executed.&endq; And
taking a little t$$green ca&s;e from his wai&s;tcoat pocket,
he put it into her hand.</P>
<P>&startq;What can you mean? is there &s;till any mi&s;take?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;None but what you may immediately rectify,
by &s;imply retaining your own prize.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, opening the ca&s;e, &s;aw the locket, and
perceived under the cry&s;tal a light knot of braided
$air. But while &s;he looked at it, he hurried into
the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She ran after him, and in&s;i&s;ted upon an explanation,
declaring it to be utterly impo&s;&s;ible that the locket
and the half guinea &s;hould belong to the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>&startq;You mu&s;t not then,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;be angry, if
you find I have managed, at la&s;t, but aukwardly.
When I came to the library, the ma&s;ter of the
ra$$le told me it was again&s;t all rule to refund a &s;ub|&s;cription.&endq;
He &s;topt.</P>
<P>&startq;The half guinea you put into my hand, then,&endq;
cried &s;he, colouring, &startq;was your own?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Mi&s;s Camilla, there is no other occa|&s;ion
upon which I would have hazarded &s;uch a li|berty;
but as the money was for a charity, and as I
had undertaken what I could not perform, I rather
ventured to replace it, than &s;uffer the poor objects for
whom it was de&s;tined, to mi&s;s your kind intention.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have certainly done right,&endq; &s;aid &s;he (feel|ing
for her pur&s;e); &startq;but you mu&s;t not, for that
rea&s;on, make me a &s;econd time do wrong.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will not &s;o much hurt me?&endq; replied he,
gravely; &startq;you will not reprove me as if I were a
&s;tranger, a mere common acquaintance? Where
could the money have been &s;o well be&s;towed? It is
not you, but tho&s;e poor people who are in my debt.
So many were the chances again&s;t your gaining the
<PB N="147" REF="147">
prize, that it was an event I had not even taken into
con&s;ideration: I had merely induced you to leave
the &s;nop, that you might not have the &s;urpri&s;e of
&s;inding your name was not withdrawn; the re&s;t was
accident; and &s;urely you will not puni&s;h me that I
have paid to the poor the penalty of my own ill
weighed offi$iou&s;ne&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla put up her pur&s;e, but, with &s;ome &s;pirit,
&s;aid: &startq;There is another way to &s;ettle the matter
which cannot hurt you; if I do not pay you my
half guinea, you mu&s;t at lea&s;t keep the fruits of your
own.&endq; And &s;he returned him the locket.</P>
<P>&startq;And what,&endq; cried he, laughing, &startq;mu&s;t I do
with it? would you have me wear it my&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Give it,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, innocently, &startq;to In|diana.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No;&endq; replied $he, (reddening and putting it
down upon a table,) but <HI>you</HI> may, if you believe her
value will be greater than your own for the hair of
your two &s;i&s;ters.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;urpri&s;ed, again looked at it, and recog|nized
the hair of Lavinia and Eugenia.</P>
<P>&startq;And how in the world did you get this hair?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I told them both the accident that had hap|pened,
and begged them to contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
to obtain your pardon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible,&endq; cried &s;he, with vivacity, &startq;you
could add to all your trouble &s;o kind a thought?&endq;
and, without a moment's further he&s;itation, &s;he ac|cepted
the prize, returning him the mo&s;t animated
thanks, and flying to Eugenia to inquire further into
the matter, and then to her uncle, to &s;hew him her
new acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, like her&s;elf, immediately &s;aid: &startq;But
why did he not give it to Indiana?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;uppo&s;e,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, &startq;becau&s;e Camilla had
her&s;elf drawn the prize, and he had only added one
hair to it.&endq;</P>
<P>This perfectly &s;atisfied the baronet; but Indiana
could by no means under&s;tand why it had not been
managed better; and Mi&s;s Margland, with much ill
<PB N="148" REF="148">
will, nouri&s;hed a private opinion that the prize might
perhaps have been her own, had not Mandlebert in|terfered.
However, as there &s;eemed &s;ome collu&s;ion
which &s;he could not develope, her con&s;cience wholly
acquitted her of any nece&s;&s;ity to refund her bor|rowed
half guinea.</P>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, decorated her&s;elf with the
locket, and had nothing in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which gave
her equal delight.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland now became, internally, le&s;s &s;an|guine,
with regard to the preference of Edgar for
Indiana; but &s;he concealed from Sir Hugh a doubt
&s;o unplea&s;ant, through an unconquerable repugnance
to acknowledge it po&s;&s;ible &s;he could have formed a
wrong judgment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Panic.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the en&s;uing Sunday, Edgar propo&s;ed that
a party &s;hould be made to vi&s;it a new little cottage,
which he had ju&s;t &s;itted up. This was agreed to;
and as it was not above a mile from the pari&s;h church,
Sir Hugh ordered that his low garden phacton &s;hould
be in readine&s;s, after the &s;ervice, to convey him&s;elf
and Eugenia thither. The re&s;t, as the weather was
fine, de&s;ired to walk.</P>
<P>They went to the church, as u&s;ual, in a coach and
a chai&s;e, which were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as &s;oon as they alight|ed:
but before that period, Eugenia, with a &s;igh,
had ob&s;erved, that Melmond, the young Oxonian,
was &s;trolling the &s;ame way, and had &s;een, with a blu&s;$,
that Bellamy was by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>The two gentlemen recogni&s;ed them as they were
cro&s;&s;ing the church-yard. The Oxonian bowed pro|$oundly,
but &s;tood aloof: Bellamy bowed al&s;o, but
immediately approached; and as Sir Hugh, at that
<PB N="149" REF="149">
moment, accidentally let fall his &s;tick, darted for|ward
to recover and pre&s;ent it him.</P>
<P>The baronet, from &s;urpri&s;e at his quick motion,
dropt his handkerchief in receiving his cane; this
al&s;o Bellamy, attentively &s;haking, re&s;tored to him:
and Sir Hugh, who could accept no civility unre|quited,
&s;aid: &startq;Sir, if you are a &s;tranger, as I
imagine, not knowing your face, you are welcome
to a place in my pew, provided you don't get a &s;eat
in a better; which I'm pretty much afraid you can't,
mine being the be&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>The invitation was promptly accepted.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, always happy to be of con&s;e|quence,
was ha&s;tening to Sir Hugh to put him upon
his guard; when a re&s;pectful offer from Bellamy to
a&s;&s;i&s;t her down the &s;teps, induced her to remit her
de&s;ign to a future opportunity. Any attentions
from a young man were now &s;o new to her as to
&s;eem a call upon her gratitude; nor had her charms
ever been &s;o attractive as to render them common.</P>
<P>Edgar and Indiana, knowing nothing of his late
declaration, thought nothing of his pre&s;ent admi&s;|&s;ion;
to Dr. Orkborne he was an utter &s;tranger;
but Camilla had recour&s;e to her fan to conceal a
&s;mile; and Eugenia was in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion.
She felt at a lo&s;s how to meet his eyes, and $eated
her&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible out of his way.</P>
<P>A few minutes after, looking up towards the gal|lery,
&s;he perceived, in one of the fur$he&s;t rows,
young Melmond; his eyes &s;ixt upon their pew, but
withdrawn the in&s;tant he was ob&s;erved, and his air
the mo&s;t melancholy and dejected.</P>
<P>Again a half &s;igh e&s;caped the tender Eugenia.
How delicate, how elegant, thought &s;he, is this re|tired
behaviour! what re&s;inement re&s;ults from a true
literary ta&s;te! O &s;uch be Clermont! if he re&s;emble
not this Oxonian&mdash;I mu&s;t be wretched for life!</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas, which unavoidably, though unwil|lingly,
interrupted her devotion, were again broken
in upon, when the &s;ervice was nearly over, by the
appearance of Lionel. He had ridden five miles to
<PB N="150" REF="150">
join them, merely not to be thought in leading|&s;trings,
by &s;taying at Etherington to hear his father:
though the name and the excellence of the preach|ing
of Mr. Tyrold, attracted to his church all
&s;trangers who had power to reach it:&mdash;&s;o vehement
in early youth is the eagerne&s;s to appear independant,
and &s;o general is the belief that all merit mu&s;t be
fou$$$ from a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The deeper under&s;tanding of Mandlebert ren|dered
him &s;uperior to this common puerility: and,
though the preacher at Cleves church was his own
tutor, Dr. Marchmont, from whom he was &s;carce
yet emancipated, he li&s;tened to him with reverence,
and would have travelled any di&s;tance, and taken
cheerfully any trouble, that would in the be&s;t and
&s;tronge&s;t manner have marked the re&s;pect with which
he attended to his doctrine.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont was a man of the highe&s;t intel|lectual
accompli&s;hments, uniting deep learning with
general knowledge, and the graceful exterior of a
man of the world, with the $rudition and &s;cience of
a fellow of a coll$ge. He obtained the e&s;teem of the
&s;cholar where$$$ he was known, and caught the appro|bation
of the mo&s;t uncultivated wherever he was &s;een.</P>
<P>When the &s;e$$$ce was over, Edgar propo&s;ed that
Dr. Marchmont &s;hould join the party to the cottage.
Sir Hugh was mo&s;t willing, and they &s;auntered
about the church, while the Doctor retired to the
ve&s;try to take off his gown.</P>
<P>During this interval, Eugenia, who had a pa&s;&s;ion
for reading epitapha and in&s;criptions, became &s;o in|tently
engaged in decyphering &s;ome old ver&s;es on an
antique tablet, that &s;he perceived not when Dr.
Marchmont was ready, nor when the party was leav|ing
the church: and before any of the re&s;t mi&s;&s;ed
her, Bellamy &s;uddenly took the opportunity of her
being out of &s;ight of all others, to drop on one knee,
and pa&s;&s;ionately &s;eize her hand, exclaiming: &startq;O
madam!&mdash;&endq; When hearing an approaching &s;tep, he
ha&s;tily aro&s;e; but parted not with her hand till he
had pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="151">
The a&s;toni&s;hed Eugenia, though at fir&s;t all emo|tion,
was completely recovered by this action. His
kneeling and his &startq;O madam!&endq; had every chance
to affect her; but his ki&s;&s;ing her hand &s;he thought a
liberty the mo&s;t unpardonable. She re&s;ented it as an
injury to Clermont, that would ri&s;k his life &s;hould
he ever know it, and a blot to her own delicacy, as
irreparable as it was irrem$diable&punc;</P>
<P>Bellamy, who, from her $ett$r, had augured
nothing of hardne&s;s of heart, t$nderly $$lie$$ed her
forgivene&s;s; but &s;he made him no an&s;wer: &s;ilent
and offended &s;he walked away, and, lo&s;ing her ti|midity
in her di&s;plea&s;ure, went up to her uncle, and
whi&s;pered: &startq;Sir, the gentleman you invited into
your pew, is Mr. Bellamy!&endq;</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation of Sir Hugh was extreme: he
had concluded him a &s;tranger to the whole party be|cau&s;e
a &s;tranger to him&s;elf; and the di&s;covery of
his mi&s;take made him next conclude, that he had
ri&s;ked a breach of the marriage he &s;o much de&s;ired
by his own indi&s;eretion. He took Eugenia imme|diately
under his arm, as if fearful &s;he might el&s;e be
conveyed away for Scotland before his eyes, and
hurrying to the church porch, called aloud for his
phaeton.</P>
<P>The phaeton was not arrived.</P>
<P>Still more di&s;mayed, he walked on with Eugenia
to the railing round the church yard, motioning with
hi$ left hand that no one &s;hould follow.</P>
<P>Edgar, Lionel, and Bellamy marched to the road,
li&s;tening for the &s;ound of hor&s;es, but they heard
none; and the carriages of the neighbouring gentry,
from which they might have hoped any a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
had been driven away while they had waited for Dr.
Marchmont.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the eyes of Eugenia again caught the
young Oxonian, who was wandering around the
church-yard: neither was he unob&s;erved by Indiana,
who, though &s;he participated not in the turn of rea|&s;oning,
or ta&s;te for the romantic, which awakened
in Eugenia &s;o forcible a &s;ympathy, was yet highly
<PB N="152" REF="152">
gratified by his apparent devotion to her charms:
and had not Mi&s;s Margland narrowly watched and
tutored her, would ea&s;ily have been attracted from
the cold civilities of Edgar, to the magneti&s;m of
animated admiration.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances, a few minutes appeared
many hours to Sir Hugh, and he pre&s;ently exclaim|ed:
&startq;There's no po&s;&s;ibility of waiting here the
whole day long, not knowing what may be the end!&endq;
Then, calling to Dr. Orkborne, he &s;aid to him in
a low voice, &startq;My good friend, here's happened a
&s;ad thing: that young man I a&s;ked into my pew,
for which I take proper &s;hame to my&s;elf, is the &s;ame
per&s;on that wanted to make Eugenia give up Cler|mont
Lynme$e, her own natural relation, and mine
into the bargain, for the &s;ake of a &s;tranger to us all;
which I hold to be rather uncommendable, con&s;ider|ing
we know nothing about him; though there's no
denying his being hand&s;ome enough to look at;
which, however, is no certainty of his making a
good hu&s;band; &s;o I'll tell you a mode I've thought
of, which I think to be a pretty good one, for part|ing
them out of hand.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, who had ju&s;t taken out his tablets,
in order to enter &s;ome hints relative to his great
work, begged him to &s;ay no more till he had fini&s;h|ed
his &s;entence. The bar$n$t looked much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,
but con&s;ented: and when he had done, went on:</P>
<P>&startq;Why, if you will hold Eugenia, I'll go up to
the re&s;t, and &s;end them on to the cottage; and when
they are gone. I &s;hall get rid of this young chap,
by telling him E$genia and I want to be alone.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne a&s;&s;ented; and Sir Hugh, advanc|ing
to the group, made his propo&s;ition, adding:
&startq;Eugenia and I will overtake you as &s;oon as the
garden-chair comes, which, I dare &s;ay, won't be
long, Robert being &s;o behind-hand already.&endq; Then,
turning to Bellamy, &startq;I am &s;orry, Sir,&endq; he &s;aid,
&startq;I can't po&s;&s;ibly a&s;k you to &s;tay with us, becau&s;e of
&s;omething my little niece and I have got to talk
about, which we had rather nobody &s;hould hear,
<PB N="153" REF="153">
being an affair of our own: but I thank you for
your civility, Sir, in picking up my &s;tick and my
pocket handkerchief, and I wi&s;h you a very good
morning and a plea&s;ant walk, which I hope. you
won't take ill.&endq;</P>
<P>Bellamy bowed, and, &s;aying he by no means in|tended
to intrude him&s;elf into the company, &s;lowly
drew back.</P>
<P>Edgar then pointed out a path through the fields
that would con&s;iderably abridge the walk, if the la|dies
could manage to cro&s;s over a dirty lane on the
other &s;ide of the church-yard.</P>
<P>The baronet, who was in high &s;pirits at the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of his &s;cheme, declared that if there was a &s;hort
cut, they &s;hould not part company, for he could
walk it him&s;elf. Edgar a&s;&s;ured him it could not be
more than half a mile, and offered him the u&s;e of
his arm.</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, my good young friend,&endq; an&s;wered he,
&s;miling &s;ignificantly: &startq;take care of Indiana! I have
got a good &s;tick, which I hold to be worth any arm
in Chri&s;tendom, except for not being alive; &s;o take
care of Indiana, I &s;ay.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar bowed, but with a &s;ilence and gravity not
unmixt with &s;urpri&s;e; and Sir Hugh, a little &s;truck,
ha&s;tily added, &startq;Nay, nay, I mean no harm!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Sir,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, recovering, &startq;you can
mean nothing but good, when you give me &s;o fair a
charge.&endq; And he placed him&s;elf at the &s;ide of In|diana.</P>
<P>&startq;Well then, now,&endq; cried Sir Hugh, I'll mar&s;hal
you all: and, fir&s;t, for my little Camilla, who &s;hall
come to my proper &s;hare; for &s;he's certainly the be&s;t
companion of the whole; which I hope nobody will
take for a &s;light, all of us not being the &s;am$ with|out
any fault of our own. Dr. Orkborne &s;hall keep
to Eugenia, becau&s;e, if there &s;hould be a want of
conver&s;ation, they can go over &s;ome of their le&s;&s;ons.
Lionel &s;hall take the care of Mrs. Margland, it being
always right for the young to help people a little
&s;tricken; and as for the odd one, Dr. Marchmont,
<PB N="154" REF="154">
why he may join little Camilla and me; for as &s;he's
none of the &s;teadie&s;t, and I am none of the &s;tronge&s;t,
it is but fair the one over &s;hould be between us.&endq;</P>
<P>Every body profe&s;&s;ed obedience but Lionel; who,
with a loud laugh, called to Edgar to change partners.</P>
<P>&startq;We are all under orders,&endq; an&s;wered he, quietly,
&startq;and I mu&s;t not be the fir&s;t to mutiny.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana &s;miled with triumph; but Mi&s;s Margland,
firing with anger, declared &s;he wanted no help, and
would accept none.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was now beginning an expo&s;tulation with
his nephew; but Lionel preferred compliance to
hearing it; yet, to obviate the ridicule which he was
per&s;uaded would follow &s;uch an acquie&s;cence, he
&s;trided up to Mi&s;s Margland with ha&s;ty &s;teps, and
dropping on one knee, in the du&s;t, &s;eized and ki&s;&s;ed
her hand; but precipitately ri&s;ing, and &s;haking him|&s;elf,
called out: &startq;My dear ma'am, have you never
a little cloaths-bru&s;h in your pocket? I can't kneel
again el&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland wrathfully turned from him; and
the party proceeded to a &s;mall gate, at the back of
the church, that opened to the lane mentioend by
Edgar, over which, when the re&s;t of the company
had pa&s;&s;ed, into a beautiful meadow, Lionel offered
his hand for conducting Mi&s;s Margland, who rejected
it di&s;dainfully.</P>
<P>&startq;Then, you will be &s;ure to fall,&endq; &s;aid he.</P>
<P>&startq;Not unle&s;s you do &s;omething to make me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will be &s;ure to fall,&endq; he repeated coolly.</P>
<P>Much alarmed, &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he would not get
over before him.</P>
<P>He ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The whole party &s;$opt; and Bellamy, who had
hitherto &s;tood &s;till and back, now ventured to ap|proach,
and in the mo&s;t courteous manner, to offer
his &s;ervices to Mi&s;s Margland. She looked victo|riou&s;ly
around her; but as he had &s;poken in a low
voice, only &s;aid: &startq;Sir?&endq; to make him repeat his
propo&s;al more audibly. He complied, and the im|pertinencies
<PB N="155" REF="155">
of Lionel rendered his civility irre&s;i&s;ti|ble:
&startq;I am glad,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;there is &s;till one
gentleman left in the world!&endq; And accepted his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, though her per&s;ecutor whi&s;pered that her
&s;park was a dead man! and &s;trutted &s;ignificantly away.</P>
<P>Half frightened, half &s;u&s;pecting &s;he was laughed
at, &s;he repeated &s;oftly to Sir Hugh the menace of
his nephew, begging that, to prevent mi&s;chief, &s;he
might &s;till retain Bellamy.</P>
<P>&startq;Lord be good unto me!&endq; cried he, &startq;what
amazing fools the boys of now a days are grown!
with all their learning, and teaching, and cla&s;&s;ics at
their tongue's end for nothing! However, not to
&s;et them together by the ears, till they grow a little
wi&s;er, which, I take it, won't be of one while,
why you mu&s;t e'en let this &s;trange gentleman walk
with you till t'other boy's further off. However,
this one thing pray mind! (lowering his voice,)
keep him all to your&s;elf! if he does but &s;o much as
look at Eugenia, give him to under&s;tand it's a thing
I &s;ha$n't take very kind of him.&endq;</P>
<P>Beckoning then to Dr. Orkborne, he unea&s;ily
&s;aid: &startq;As I am now obliged to have that young
fellow along with us, for the &s;ake of preventing an
affray, about nobody knows what, which is the com|mon
rea&s;on of quarrels among tho&s;e raw young fry,
I beg you to keep a particular &s;harp look out, that
he does not take the opportunity to run off with
Eugenia.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the baronet had over-rated his
&s;trength; and he was forced to &s;it upon the lower
&s;tep of a broad &s;tile at the other end of the mea|dow:
while Mi&s;s Margland, who leant her tall thin
figure again&s;t a $ive-barred gate, willingly obviated
his &s;olicitude about Eugenia, by keeping Bellamy
in clo&s;e and unabating conference with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance in the &s;eenery before him now
&s;truck Dr. Orkborne with &s;ome re&s;emblance to a
ve$&s;e in $ne of Virgi$'s Eclogues, which he thought
might be happily applied to illu&s;trate a pa&s;&s;age in his
own work; taking out, therefore, his tablets, he
<PB N="156" REF="156">
begged Eugenia not to move, and wrote his quota|tion;
which, leading him on to &s;ome reflections
upon the &s;ubject, &s;oon drove his charge from his
thoughts, and con&s;igned him &s;olely to his pencil.</P>
<P>Eugenia willingly kept her place at his &s;ide; of|fended
by Bellamy, &s;he would give him no chance of
&s;peaking with her, and the protection under which
her uncle had placed her &s;he deemed &s;acred.</P>
<P>Here they remained but a &s;hort time, when their
ears received the &s;hock of a prodigious roar from a
bull in the field adjoining. Mi&s;s Margland &s;creamed,
and hid her face with her hands. Indiana, taught
by her le&s;&s;ons to nouri&s;h every fear as becoming,
&s;hri$kt &s;till louder, and ran &s;wiftly away, deaf to
all that Edgar, who attended her, could urge. Eu|genia,
to whom Bellamy in&s;tantly ha&s;tened, &s;eeing
the bea&s;t furiou&s;ly make towards the gate, almo&s;t
uncon&s;ciou&s;ly accepted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to accelerate
her flight from its vicinity; while Dr. Orkborne,
intent upon his annotations, calmly wrote on, &s;en|&s;ible
there was &s;ome di&s;turbance, but determining to
evade inquiring whence it aro&s;e, till he had &s;ecured
what he meant to tran&s;mit to po&s;terity from the
treachery of his memory.</P>
<P>Camilla, the lea&s;t frightened, becau&s;e the mo&s;t
enured to &s;uch &s;ounds, from the habits and the in|&s;truction
of her rural life and education, adhered
firmly to Sir Hugh, who began ble&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with
&s;ome alarm; but whom Dr. Marchmont re-a&s;&s;ured,
by &s;aying the gate was &s;ecured, and too high for the
bull to leap, even &s;uppo&s;ing it a vicious animal.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t panic was &s;till in its meridian, when
Lionel, ru&s;hing pa&s;t the bea&s;t, which he had &s;ecretly
been tormenting, &s;kipt over the gate, with every ap|pearance
of terror, and called out: &startq;Save your|&s;elves
all! Mi&s;s Margland in particular; for here's
a mad bull!&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;econd a&s;tounding bellow put a &s;top to any que&s;|tion,
and wholly checked the immediate impul&s;e of
Mi&s;s Margland to a&s;k why &s;he was thus &s;elected;
&s;he &s;natched her hands from her face, not doubting
<PB N="157" REF="157">
&s;he &s;hould &s;ee her e&s;quire &s;oothingly &s;tanding by her
&s;ide; but, though internally &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;hocked
to find her&s;elf de&s;erted, &s;he gathered &s;trength to run
from the gate with the nimblene&s;s of youth, and,
flying to the &s;tile, regardle&s;s of Sir Hugh, and for|getting
all her charges, &s;crambled over it, and ran
on from the noi&s;e, without looking to the right or
the left.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, whom Lionel'$ information, and Mi&s;s
Margland's pu&s;hing pa&s;t him, had extremely ter|rified,
was now al&s;o getting over the &s;tile, with the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Dr. Marchmont, ejaculating; &startq;Lord
help us! what a poor race we are! No &s;afety for us!
if we only come out once in a dozen years, we mu&s;t
meet with a mad bull!&endq;</P>
<P>He had, however, in&s;i&s;ted that Camilla &s;hould
jump over fir&s;t, &s;aying, &startq;There's no need of all of
us being to&s;t, my dear girl, becau&s;e of my &s;lowne&s;s,
which is no fault of mine, but of Robert's not being
in the way; which mu&s;t needs make the poor fellow
unhappy enough, when he hears of it: which, no
doubt, I &s;hall let him do, according to his de&s;erts.&endq;</P>
<P>The other &s;ide of the &s;tile brought them to the
high road. Lionel, who had only wi&s;hed to torment
Mi&s;s Margland, felt his heart &s;mite him, when he
&s;aw the fright of his uncle, and flew to acquaint
him that he had made a mi&s;take, for the bull was
only angry, not mad.</P>
<P>The un&s;u&s;picious baronet thanked him for this
good news, and &s;at upon a bank till the party could
be collected.</P>
<P>This, however, was not &s;oon to be done; the di&s;|per&s;ion
from the meadow having been made in every
po&s;&s;ible direction.</P>

<P>INDIANA, intent upon running on, had nearly
reached the church-yard, without hearkening to one
word of the expo&s;tulating Mandlebert; when, lean|ing
over a tomb&s;tone, on which &s;he had her&s;elf leant
while waiting for the carriage, &s;he perceived the
young Oxonian. An in&s;tinctive &s;pirit of coquetry
made her now increa&s;e her pace; he heard the ru&s;t|ling
of a female approach, and looked up; her
beauty, heightened by her flight, which animated
her complexion, while it di&s;played her fine form,
&s;eemed more than ever cele&s;tial to the enamoured &s;tu|dent;
who darted forward from an impul&s;e of irre|&s;i&s;tible
&s;urpri&s;e. &startq;O Heaven!&endq; &s;he cried, panting
and &s;topping as he met her; &startq;I &s;hall die! I &s;hall
die!&mdash;I am pur&s;ued by a mad bull!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar would have explained, that all was &s;afe;
but Melmond neither heard nor &s;aw him&mdash;&startq;O, give
me, then,&endq; he cried, emphatically; &startq;give me the
extacy to protect&mdash;to &s;ave you!&endq;</P>
<P>His out-&s;pread arms &s;hewed his intention to bear
her away; but Edgar, placing him&s;elf between them,
&s;aid: &startq;Pardon me, Sir! this lady is under my care!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O don't &s;ight about me! don't quarrel!&endq;
cried Indiana, with an apprehen&s;ion half &s;imple,
half affected.</P>
<P>&startq;No, Madam!&endq; an&s;wered Melmond, re&s;pect|fully
retreating; &startq;I know too&mdash;too well! my little
claim in &s;uch a di&s;pute!&mdash;Permit me, however, to
a&s;&s;i&s;t you, Mr. Mandlebert, in your &s;earch of refuge;
and deign, madam, to endure me in your &s;ight, till
this alarm pa&s;&s;es away.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana, by no means in&s;en&s;ible to this language,
looked with &s;om$ elation at Edgar, to &s;ee how he
bore it.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="159">
Edgar was not &s;urpri&s;ed; he had already ob&s;erved
the potent impre&s;&s;ion made by the beauty of In|diana
upon the Oxonian; and was &s;truck, in defiance
of its romance and &s;uddenne&s;s, with its air of &s;in|cerity;
he only, therefore, gently an&s;wered, that
there was not the lea&s;t cau&s;e of fear.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, how can you &s;ay &s;o?&endq; &s;aid Indiana; &startq;how
can you take &s;o little intere&s;t in me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At lea&s;t, at lea&s;t,&endq; cried Melmond, trembling
with eagerne&s;s, &startq;conde&s;cend to accept a double
guard!&mdash;Refu&s;e not, Mr. Mandlebert, to &s;uffer my
attendance!&endq;</P>
<P>Mandlebert, a little embarra&s;&s;ed, an&s;wered; &startq;I
have no authority to decide for Mi&s;s Lynmere; but,
certainly, I &s;ee no occa&s;ion for any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&endq;</P>
<P>Melmond fervently cla&s;ped his hands, and ex|claimed:
&startq;Do not, do not, madam, command me
to leave you till all danger is over!&endq;</P>
<P>The little heart of Indiana beat high with tri|umph;
&s;he thought Mandlebert jealous: Mi&s;s Mar|gland
had often told her there was no &s;u$er way to
quicken him: and, even independently of this idea,
the &s;pirit, the ardour, the admiration of the Oxonian,
had a power upon her mind that needed no auxiliary
for delighting it.</P>
<P>She curt&s;ied her con&s;ent; but declared &s;he would
never go back the &s;ame way. They proceeded,
therefore, by a little round to the high road, which
led to the field in which the party had been di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>Indiana was full of &s;tarts, little &s;hricks, and pal|pitations;
every one of which rendered her, in the
eyes of the Oxonian, more and more captivating;
and, while Edgar walked gravely on, reflecting, with
&s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, upon being thus drawn in to &s;uffer
the attendance of a youth &s;o nearly a &s;tranger, upon
a young lady actually under his protection; Mel|mond
was continually ejaculating in return to her
perpetual apprehen&s;ions, &startq;What lovely timidity!&mdash;
What bewitching &s;oftne&s;s!&mdash;What &s;eminine, what
beautiful delicacy!&mdash;How &s;weet in terror!&mdash;How
&s;oul-pi$r$ing in alarm!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="160">
The&s;e exclamations were nearly enchanting to In|diana,
who&s;e only fear was, le&s;t they &s;hould not be
heard by Edgar; and, whenever they cea&s;ed, when|ever
a pau$e and re&s;pectful &s;ilence took their place,
new &s;tarts, fre&s;h palpitations, and de&s;igned fal&s;e &s;teps,
again called them forth; while the &s;mile with which
&s;he repaid their enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;peaker, was fuel to his
flame, but poi&s;on to his peace.</P>
<P>They had not proceeded far, when they were met
by Mi&s;s Margland, who, in equal trepidation from
anger and from fear, was &s;till making the be&s;t of her
way from the bellowing of the bull. Edgar inquired
for Sir Hugh, and the re&s;t of the party; but &s;he
could &s;peak only of Lionel; his in&s;olence and his
ill u&s;age; prote&s;ting nothing but her regard for In|diana,
could induce her to live a moment longer
under his uncle's roof.</P>
<P>&startq;But where,&endq; again cried Edgar, &startq;where is
Sir Hugh? and where are the ladies?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To&s;&s;ed by the bull,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, petti&s;hly,
&startq;for aught I know; I did not choo&s;e to &s;tay and
be to&s;&s;ed my&s;elf; and a per&s;on like Mr. Lionel can
&s;oon make &s;uch a bea&s;t point at one, if he takes it
into his humour.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar then begged they might ha&s;ten to their
company; but Mi&s;s Margland po&s;itively refu&s;ed to
go back: and Indiana, always ready to &s;econd any
alarm, declared, &s;he &s;hould quite &s;ink with fright,
if they went within an hundred yards of that horrid
field. Edgar &s;till pleaded that the baronet would
expect them; but Melmond, in &s;ofter tones, &s;poke
of fears, &s;en&s;ibility, and dangers; and Edgar &s;oon
found he was talking to the winds.</P>
<P>All now that remained to prevent further &s;epa|ration
was, that Edgar &s;hould run on to the party,
and acquaint them that Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana
would wait for them upon the high road.</P>
<P>Melmond, meanwhile, felt in paradi&s;e; even the
pre&s;ence of Mi&s;s Margland could not re&s;train his
rapture, upon a ca&s;ualty that gave him &s;uch a charge,
though it forced him to forbear making the direct
<PB N="161" REF="161">
and open declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion, with which his
heart was bu$ning, and his tongue quivering. He
attended them both with the mo&s;t fervent re&s;pect,
evidently very gratifying to the object of his adora|tion,
though not noticed by Mi&s;s Margland, who
was wholly ab&s;orbed by her own provocations.</P>
<P>Edgar &s;oon reached the bank by the road's &s;ide,
upon which the baro$$t, Dr. Marchmont, Lionel,
and Camilla were &s;$$ted. &startq;Lord help us!&endq; ex|claimed
Sir Hugh, agha&s;t at his approach, &startq;if here
is not young Mr. Edgar without Indiana! This is a
thing I could never have expected from you, young
Mr. Edgar! that you &s;hould leave her, I don't know
where, and come without her!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar a&s;&s;ured him &s;he was &s;af$, and under the
care of Mi&s;s Margland, but that neither of them
could be prevailed with to come farther: he had,
therefore, advanced to inquire after the re&s;t of the
party, and to arrange where they &s;hould all a&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P>&startq;You have done very right, then, my dear, Mr.
Edgar, as you always do, as far as I can make out,
when I come to the bottom. And now I am quite
ea&s;y about Indiana. But as to Eugenia, what Dr.
Orkborne has done with her is more than I can de|vi&s;e;
unle&s;s, indeed, they are got to &s;tudying &s;ome
of their Greek verbs, and &s;o forgot us all, which is
likely enough; only I had rather they had taken an|other
time, not much caring to &s;tay here longer than
I can help.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar &s;aid&punc; he would make a circuit in &s;earch of
them; but, fir&s;t, addre&s;&s;ing Camilla, &startq;You alone,&endq;
he cried, with an approving &s;mile, &startq;have remained
thus quiet, while all el&s;e have been &s;campering apart,
making <HI>confu&s;ion wor&s;e confounded.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have lived too completely in the country to
be afraid of cattle,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered; &startq;and Dr. march|mont
a&s;&s;ured me there was no danger.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You can li&s;ten, then, even when you are alarm|ed,&endq;
&s;aid he, expre&s;&s;ively, &startq;to the voice of rea&s;on!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla rai&s;ed her eyes, and looked at him, but
dropt them again without making any an&s;wer: Can
<PB N="162" REF="162">
<HI>you,</HI> &s;he thought, have been pleading it in vain? How
I wonder at Indiana?</P>
<P>He then &s;et out to &s;eek Eugenia, recommending
the &s;ame office to Lionel by another route; but
Lionel no &s;ooner gathered where Mi&s;s Margland
might be met with, than his repentance was for|gotten,
and he quitted every thing to encounter her.</P>
<P>Edgar &s;pent near half an hour in his &s;earch, with|out
the &s;malle&s;t &s;ucce&s;s: he was then &s;eriou&s;ly unea&s;y,
and returning to the party, when a countryman, to
whom he was known, told him he had &s;een Mi&s;s Eu|genia
Tyrold, with a very hand&s;ome fine town gen|tleman,
going into a farm hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Edgar flew to the &s;pot, and through a window, as
he advanced, perceived Eugenia &s;eated, and Bellamy
kneeling before her.</P>
<P>Amazed and concerned, $e abruptly made his
way into the apartment. Bellamy ro&s;e in the utmo&s;t
confu&s;ion, and Eugenia, &s;tarting and colouring,
caught Edgar by the arm, but could not &s;peak.</P>
<P>He told her that her uncle and the whole company
were waiting for her in great anxiety.</P>
<P>&startq;And where, where,&endq; $$ed &s;he, &startq;are they? I
have been in agonies about them all! and I could not
prevail&mdash;I could not&mdash;this gentleman &s;aid the ri&s;k
was &s;o great&mdash;he would not &s;uffer me&mdash;but he has
&s;ent for a chai&s;e, though I told him I had a thou&s;and
times rather hazard my life among&s;t them, and with
them, than &s;ave it alone!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They are all perfectly &s;afe, nor has there ever
been any danger.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I was told&mdash;I was a&s;&s;ured&mdash;&endq; &s;aid Bellamy,
&startq;that a mad bull was running wild about the coun|try;
and I thought it, therefore, advi&s;able to &s;end
for a chai&s;e from the neare&s;t $word$, that I might return
this young lady to her friends.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar made no an&s;wer, but offered his arm to
conduct Eugenia to her uncle. She accepted it,
and Bellamy attended on her other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Edgar was &s;ilent the whole way. The attitude in
which he had &s;urpri&s;ed Bellamy, by a&s;&s;uring him of
<PB N="163" REF="163">
the nature of his preten&s;ions, had awakened doubts
the mo&s;t alarming of the de&s;tination in view for the
chai&s;e which he had ordered; and he believed that
Eugenia was either to have been beguiled, or be|trayed,
into a journey the mo&s;t remote from the home
to which &s;he belonged.</P>
<P>Eugenia increa&s;ed his &s;u&s;picions by the mere con|fu&s;ion
which deterred her from removing them. Bel|lamy
h$d a&s;&s;ured her &s;he was in the mo&s;t iminent
per&s;onal d$nger, and had $urried her from field to
field, with an idea that the dreaded animal was in
full pur&s;uit. When carried, however, into the farm
hou&s;e, &s;he lo&s;t all apprehen&s;ion for her&s;elf in fears for
her friends, and in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;haring their fate. Bel|lamy,
who immediately ordered a chai&s;e, then ca&s;t
him&s;elf at her feet, to intreat &s;he would not throw
away her life by &s;o ra&s;h a mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Exhau&s;ted, from her lamene&s;s, &s;he was forced to
&s;it &s;till, and &s;uch was their &s;ituation at the entrance
of Edgar. She wi&s;hed extremely to explain what
had been the object of the &s;olicitation of Bellamy,
and to clear him, as well as her&s;elf, from any fur|ther
$urni&s;es; but &s;he was a&s;hamed to begin the &s;ub|ject.
Edgar had &s;een a man at her feet, and &s;he
thought, her&s;elf, it was a cruel injury to Clermont,
though &s;he knew not how to refu&s;e it forgivene&s;s,
&s;ince it was merely to &s;upplicate &s;he would &s;ave her
own life.</P>
<P>Bellamy, therefore, was the only one who &s;poke;
and his unan&s;wered ob&s;ervations contributed but little
to enliven the walk.</P>
<P>When they came within &s;ight of the party, the
baronet was again &s;eized with the extreme&s;t di&s;may.
&startq;Why now, what's this?&endq; cried he; &startq;here's no|thing
but blunders. Pray, Sir, who gave you au|thority
to take my niece from her own tutor? for &s;o
I may call him, though more properly &s;peaking, he
came among&s;t us to be mine; which however, is no
affair but of our own&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir,&endq; an&s;wered Bellamy, advancing and bowing;
&startq;I hope I have had the happine&s;s of rather doing
<PB N="164" REF="164">
&s;ervice than mi&s;chief; I &s;aw the young lady upon
the point of de&s;truction, and I ha&s;tened her to a
place of &s;ecurity, from whence I had ordered a po&s;t|chai&s;e,
to convey her &s;afe to your hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, my dear uncle,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, recovering
from her embarra&s;&s;ment; &startq;I have occa&s;ioned this
gentleman infinite trouble; and though Mr. Man|dlebert
a&s;&s;ures us there was no real danger, he thought
there was, and therefore I mu&s;t always hold my&s;elf
to be greatly obliged to him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, if that's the ca&s;e, I mu&s;t be obliged to
him too; which, to tell you the truth, is not a thing
I am remarkably fond of having happened. But
where's Dr. Orkborne? I hope he's come to no
harm, by his not &s;hewing him&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At the moment of terror,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, &startq;I
accepted the fir&s;t offer of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, concluding we
were all hurrying away at the &s;ame time; but I &s;aw
Dr. Orkborne no more afterwards.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I can't &s;ay that was over and above kind of him,
nor careful neither,&endq; cried Sir Hugh, &startq;con&s;idering
&s;ome particular rea&s;ons; however, where is he now?&endq;</P>
<P>Nobody could &s;ay; no one had &s;een or ob&s;erved
him.</P>
<P>&startq;Why then, ten to one, poor gentleman!&endq; ex|claimed
the baronet, &startq;but he's the very per&s;on him|&s;elf
who's to&s;&s;ed, while we are all of us running away
for nothing!&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;u&s;picion now occurred to Dr. Marchmont,
which led him to return over the &s;tile into the field
where the confu&s;ion had begun; and there, on the
exact &s;pot where he had fir&s;t taken out his tablets,
calmly &s;tood Dr. Orkborne; looking now upon his
writing, now up to the &s;ky, but &s;eeing nothing any
where, from inten&s;e ab&s;orption of thought upon the
illu&s;tration he was framing.</P>
<P>Awakened from his reverie by the Doctor, his fir&s;t
recollection was of Eugenia; he had not doubted
her remaining quietly by his &s;ide, and the moment
he looked round and mi&s;&s;ed her, he felt con&s;iderable
<PB N="165" REF="165">
compunction. The good Doctor, however, a&s;&s;ured
him all were &s;afe, and conducted him to the group.</P>
<P>&startq;So here you are,&endq; &s;aid the baronet, &startq;and no
more to&s;&s;ed than my&s;elf, for which I am &s;incerely
thankful, though I can't &s;ay I think you have taken
much care of my niece, nobody knowing what might
have become of her, if it had not been for that
&s;trange gentleman, that I never &s;aw before.&endq;</P>
<P>He then formally placed Eugenia under the care
of Dr. Marchmont.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, piqued by this transfer, &s;ullenly
followed, and now gave to her, pertinaciou&s;ly, his
undivided attention. Drawn by a total revul&s;ion of
ideas from the chain of thinking that had led him to
compo&s;ition, he relinqui&s;hed his annotations in re|&s;entment
of this di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, when he might have
pur&s;ued them uninterruptedly without neglect of
other avocations.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Two Doctors.</HEAD>
<P>A COUNCIL was now held upon what cour&s;e
mu&s;t next be taken. Both Sir Hugh and Eugenia
were too much fatigued to walk any further; yet it
was concluded that the garden chair, by &s;ome mi&s;take,
was gone &s;traight to the cottage. Edgar, therefore,
propo&s;ed running thither to bring it round for them,
while Dr. Orkborne &s;hould go forward for Mi&s;s
Margland and Indiana, and conduct them by the
high road to the &s;ame place; where the whole party
might at length re-a&s;&s;emble. Sir Hugh approved the
plan, and he &s;et off in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>But not &s;o Dr. Orkborne; he thought him&s;elf
di&s;graced by being &s;ent from one po&s;t to another;
and though Eugenia was nothing to him, in com|petition
with his tablets and his work, his own in|&s;tructions
<PB N="166" REF="166">
had &s;o rai&s;ed her in his mind, that he
thought her the only female worthy a moment of his
time. Indiana he looked upon with ine$$able con|tempt;
the incapacity &s;he had &s;hewn during the &s;hort
time &s;he was under his pupillage, had convinced him
of the futility of her whole &s;ex, from which he held
Eugenia to be a partial exception: and Mi&s;s Mar|gland,
who never &s;poke to him but in a voice of
haughty &s;uperiority, and whom he never an&s;wered,
but with an air of &s;olemn &s;uper$$$$ou&s;ne&s;s, was his
rooted aver&s;ion. He could not brook being em|ployed
in the &s;eivice of either; he &s;tood, therefore,
motionle&s;s, till Sir Hugh repeated the propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Not caring to di&s;oblige him, he then, without
&s;peaking, &s;lowly and unwillingly moved forwards.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;ee,&endq; &s;aid the baronet, &s;oftened rather than
offended, &startq;he does not much like to leave his little
&s;cholar, which is but natural; though I took it ra|ther
unkind his $$tting the poor thing run again&s;t the
very horns of the bull, as one may &s;ay, if it had
not been for a mere accidental pa&s;&s;enger. However,
one mu&s;t always make allowance for a man that takes
much to his &s;tudies, tho&s;e things generally turning
the head pretty much into a narrow compa&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>He then called after him, and &s;aid if the walk
would tire him, he would wait till they came of
them&s;elves, which no doubt they would &s;oon do, as
Lionel was gone for them.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne gladly &s;topt; but Dr. Marchmont,
&s;eeing little likelihood of a general meeting without
&s;ome trouble, offered to take the commi&s;&s;ion upon
him&s;elf, with a politene&s;s that &s;eemed to &s;hew it to
be a wi&s;h of his own.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh accepted his kindne&s;s with thanks; and
Dr. Orkborne, though &s;ecretly di&s;concerted by &s;uch
&s;uperior alacrity in &s;o learned a man, was well content
to rein&s;tate him&s;elf by the &s;ide of his pupil.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who &s;aw the eyes of Bellamy con&s;tantly
turned towards Eugenia, thought his pre&s;ence highly
dangerous, and with much tribulation, &s;aid: &startq;As
I find, Sir, we may all have to &s;tay here, I don't
<PB N="167" REF="167">
know how long. I hope you won't be affronted, after
my be&s;t thanks for your keeping my niece from the
bull, if I don't make any particular point of begging
the favour of you to &s;tay much longer with us.&endq;</P>
<P>Bellamy, extremely chagrined, ca&s;t an appealing
look at Eugenia, and expre&s;&s;ing his regret that his
&s;ervices were inadmi&s;&s;ible, made his retreat with un|di&s;gui&s;ed
reluctance.</P>
<P>Eugenia, per&s;uaded &s;he owed him a &s;erious obli|gation
for his care, as well as for his partiality, felt
the &s;incere&s;t concern at his apparent di&s;tre&s;s, and
contributed far more than &s;he intended to its re|moval,
by the gentle countenance with which &s;he re|ceived
his &s;orrowful glance.</P>
<P>Bellamy, ha&s;tily overtaking Dr. Marchmont,
darted on before him in &s;earch of Mi&s;s Margland
and Indiana, who, far from advancing, were pacing
their way back to the church-yard. Lionel had
joined them, and the incen&s;ed Mi&s;s Margland had
encouraged the glad attendance of the Oxonian, as
a protection to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of Bellamy by no means tended to di&s;|per&s;e
the &s;torm: She re&s;ented his de&s;erting her while
&s;he was in danger, and de&s;ired to &s;ee no more of
him. But when he had re&s;pectfully &s;uffered her
wrath to vent it&s;elf, he made apologies, with an ob|&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s
&s;o rare to her, and a deference &s;o &s;trik|ingly
contra&s;ted with the daring ridicule of Lionel,
that &s;he did not long oppo&s;e the potent charm of
adulation&mdash;a charm which, however it may be &s;weet|ened
by novelty, &s;eldom lo&s;es its effect by any fa|miliarity.</P>
<P>During the&s;e conte&s;ts, Indiana was left wholly to
young Melmond, and the temptation was too &s;trong
for his impa&s;&s;ioned feelings to with&s;tand: &startq;O faire&s;t,&endq;
he cried, &startq;faire&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful of all created
beings! Can I re&s;i&s;t&mdash;no! this one, one effu&s;ion&mdash;
the fir&s;t and the la&s;t! The &s;en&s;ibility of your mind
will plead for me&mdash;I read it in tho&s;e heavenly eyes&mdash;
they emit mercy in their beauty! they are as radiant
<PB N="168" REF="168">
with goodne&s;s as with loveline&s;s! alas! I t$e&s;pa&s;s&mdash;
I blu&s;h, and dare not hope your forgivene&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topt, terrified at his own pre&s;umption; but
the looks of Indiana were never more beautiful, and
never le&s;s formidable. A milder doom, therefore,
&s;eemed &s;uddenly to bur&s;t upon his view. Elated and
enraptured, he vehemently exclaimed: &startq;Oh, were
my lot not irrevocably mi&s;erable! were the &s;malle&s;t
ray of light to beam upon my de&s;pondence!&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana &s;till &s;poke not a word, but &s;he withdrew
not her &s;miles; and $he enraptured &s;tudent, lifted
into the highe&s;t bli&s;s by the permi&s;&s;ion even of a
doubt, walked on, tran&s;ported, by her &s;ide, too
happy in &s;u&s;pence to wi$h an explanation.</P>
<P>In this manner they proceeded, till they were
joined by Dr. Marchmont. The ta&s;k he had at|tempted
was beyond his power of performance; Mi&s;s
Margland was inexorable; &s;he declared nothing
&s;hould induce her to go a &s;tep towards the field in|habited
by the bull, and every a&s;&s;urance of &s;afety the
Doctor could urge was ineffectual.</P>
<P>He next a&s;&s;ailed Indiana; but her fir&s;t terror,
&s;oothed by the compa&s;&s;ion and admiration of Mel|mond,
was now revived, and &s;he prote&s;ted, almo&s;t
with tears, that to go within an hundred yards of
that dreadful meadow would make her undoubtedly
faint away. The tender commi&s;eration of Melmond
confirmed her apprehen&s;ions, and &s;he &s;oon looked
upon Dr. Marchmont as a ba$barian for making the
propo&s;al.</P>
<P>The Doctor then commended them to the care of
Lionel, and returned with this repul&s;e to Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>The baronet, incapable of being angry with any
one he conceived to be frightened, &s;aid they &s;hould
be pre&s;&s;ed no more, for he would give up going to
the cottage, and put his be&s;t foot forward to walk
on to them him&s;elf; adding he was &s;o overjoyed to
have got rid of that young &s;park, that he had no
fear but that he, and poor Eugenia, too, &s;hould both
do as well as they could.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="169">
They proceeded very &s;lowly, the baronet leaning
upon Dr. Marchmont, and Eugenia upon Dr. Ork|borne,
who watchful, with no &s;mall alarm, of the
behaviour of the only man he had yet &s;een with any
internal re&s;pect, &s;ince he left the univer&s;ity, &s;acrificed
completely his notes and his tablets to emulate his
attentions.</P>
<P>When they approached the church-yard, in which
Mi&s;s Margland and her party had halted, Sir Hugh
perceived Bellamy. He &s;topt &s;hort, calling out, with
extreme chagrin, &startq;Lord help us! what a thing it
is to rejoice! which one never knows the right &s;ea&s;on
to do, on the &s;core of meeting with di&s;appointments!&endq;</P>
<P>Then, after a little meditation, &startq;There is but one
thing,&endq; he cried, &startq;to be done, which is to guard
from the fir&s;t again&s;t any more mi&s;chief, having al|ready
had enough of it for one morning, not to &s;ay
more than I could have wi&s;hed by half: So do you,
good Dr. Marchmont, take Eugenia under your
own care, and I'll make &s;hift with Dr. Orkborne for
my&s;elf; for, in the ca&s;e he &s;hould take again to
writing or thinking, it will be nothing to me to keep
&s;till till he has done; provided it &s;hould happen at a
place where I can &s;it down.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne had never felt &s;o deeply hurt; the
&s;ame commi&s;&s;ion transferred to Edgar, or to Lionel,
would have failed to affect him; he con&s;idered them
as of an age fitted for &s;uch frivolous employment,
which he thought as much below his dignity, as the
young men them&s;elves were beneath his competition:
but the comfort of contempt, a &s;pecies of con&s;olation
ever ready to offer it&s;elf to the impul&s;ive pride of
man, was here an alleviation he could not call to his
aid; the character of Dr. Marchmont &s;tood as high
in erudition as his own; and, though his acquaint|ance
with him was merely per&s;onal, the fame of his
learning, the only attribute to which fame, in his
conception, belonged, had reached him from au|thority
too unque&s;tionable for doubt. The urbanity,
therefore, of his manners, his general diffu&s;ion of
di&s;cour&s;e, and his univer&s;al complai&s;ance, filled him
<PB N="170" REF="170">
with a&s;toni&s;hment, and rai&s;ed an emotion of envy
which no other per&s;on would have been deemed wor|thy
of exciting.</P>
<P>But though his long and fixed re&s;idence at Cleves
had now removed the $word$ circum&s;pection with
which he fir&s;t &s;ought to en&s;ure his e&s;tabli&s;hment, he
yet would not venture any po&s;itive refu&s;al to the ba|ronet;
he re&s;igned, therefore, his young charge to
his new and formidable opponent, and even exerted
him&s;elf to mark &s;ome alacrity in a&s;&s;i&s;ting Sir Hugh.
But his whole real attention was upon Dr. March|mont,
whom his eye followed in every motion, to
di&s;cover, if po&s;&s;ible, by what art unknown he had
acquired &s;uch a command over his thoughts and un|der&s;tanding,
as to bear patiently, nay plea&s;antly, with
the idle and unequal companions of general &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont, who was rector of Cleves, had
been introduced to Sir Hugh upon the baronet's
&s;ettling in the large man&s;ion-hou&s;e of that village;
but he had not vi&s;ited at the hou&s;e, nor had his com|pany
been &s;olicited. Sir Hugh, who could never
&s;eparate under&s;tanding from learning, nor want of
education from folly, concluded that &s;uch a man as
Dr. Marchmont mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily de&s;pi&s;e him; and
though the extreme &s;weetne&s;s of his temper made
him draw the conclu&s;ion without re&s;entment, it &s;o
effectually prevented all wi&s;h of any intercour&s;e, that
they had never conver&s;ed together till this morning;
and his &s;urpri&s;e, now, at &s;uch civilities and good hu|mour
in &s;o great a &s;cholar, di&s;&s;ered only from that
of Dr. Orkborne, in being accompanied with admi|ration
in&s;tead of envy.</P>
<P>Eugenia thus di&s;po&s;ed of, they were proceeding,
when Sir Hugh next ob&s;erved the young Oxonian:
He was &s;peaking with Indiana, to whom his pa&s;&s;ionate
devotion was glaring from his looks, air, and whole
manner.</P>
<P>&startq;Lord help me!&endq; exclaimed he; &startq;if there is
not another of the&s;e new chaps, that nobody knows
any thing about, talking to Indiana! and, for aught
I can tell to the contrary, making love to her! I
think I never took &s;uch a bad walk as this before,
<PB N="171" REF="171">
&s;ince the hour I was born, in point of unluckine&s;s.
Robert will have enough to an&s;wer for, which he
mu&s;t expect to hear; and indeed I am not much ob|liged
to Mrs. Margland her&s;elf, and &s;o I mu&s;t needs
tell her, though it is not what I much like to do.&endq;</P>
<P>He then made a &s;ign to Mi&s;s Margland to ap|proach
him: &startq;Mi&s;s Margland,&endq; he cried, &startq;I &s;hould
not have taken the liberty to beckon you in this man|ner,
but that I think it right to a&s;k you what tho&s;e
two young gentlemen, that I never &s;aw before, do in
the church-yard; which is a thing I think rather
odd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to that gentleman, Sir,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, brid|ling,
&startq;who was &s;tanding by me, he is the only per&s;on
I have found to protect me from Mr. Lionel, who&s;e
behaviour, Sir, I mu&s;t freely tell you&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why certainly, Mi&s;s Margland, I can't deny
but he's rather a little over and above giddy; but I
am &s;ure your under&s;tanding won't mind it, in con|&s;ideration
of his being young enough to be your &s;on,
in the ca&s;e of your having been married time enough.&endq;</P>
<P>He then de&s;ired Indiana would come to him.</P>
<P>The rapture of the Oxonian was converted into
torture by this &s;ummons; and the &s;u&s;pence which the
moment before he had gilded with the gay colours of
hope, he felt would be no longer &s;upportable when
deprived of the &s;ight of his divinity. Scarce could
he refrain from ca&s;ting him&s;elf publicly at her feet,
and pouring forth the wi&s;hes of his heart. But when
again the call was repeated, and he &s;aw her look an|other
way, as if de&s;irous not to attend to it, the im|pul&s;e
of quick ri&s;ing joy di&s;per&s;ed his &s;mall remains
of forbearance, and precipitately cla&s;ping his hands,
&startq;O go not!&endq; he pa&s;&s;ionately exclaimed; &startq;leave
me not in this aby&s;s of &s;uffering! Faire&s;t and mo&s;t
beautiful! tell me at lea&s;t, if my death is inevitable!
if no time&mdash;no con&s;tancy&mdash;no adoration&mdash;may ever
dare hope to penetrate that gentle&s;t of bo&s;oms!&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana her&s;elf was now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;en|&s;ible
of a little emotion; the animation of this addre&s;s
delighted her; it was new, and it$ effect was highly
<PB N="172" REF="172">
plea&s;ing. How cold, &s;he thought, is Edgar! She
made not any an&s;wer, but permitted her eyes to
meet his with the mo&s;t langui&s;hing &s;oftne&s;s.</P>
<P>Melmond trembled through his whole frame;
de&s;pair flew him, and expectation wore her brighte&s;t
plumage: &startq;O pronounce but one word,&endq; he cried,
&startq;one &s;ingle word!&mdash;are, are you&mdash;O &s;ay not yes!
&mdash;irrevocably engaged?&mdash;lo&s;t to all hope&mdash;all po&s;&s;i|bility
for ever?&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana again licen&s;ed her fine eyes with their
mo&s;t melting powers, and all &s;elf-control was finally
over with her impa&s;&s;ioned lover; who, mingling
prayers for her favour, with adoration of her beauty,
heeded not who heard him, and forgot every pre|&s;ence
but her own.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, who, engro&s;&s;ed by per&s;onal re|&s;entment
and debates, had not remarked the ri&s;ing
courage and energy of Melmond, had ju&s;t turned to
Indiana, upon the &s;econd call of Sir Hugh, and be|came
now utterly confounded by the &s;ight of her
willing attention; &startq;Mi&s;s Lynmere,&endq; cried &s;he, an|grily,
&startq;what are you thinking of? Suppo&s;e Mr.
Mandlebert &s;hould come, what might be the con&s;e|quence?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mandlebert?&endq; repeated Melmond, while the
blood for&s;ook his cheeks; &startq;is it then even &s;o?&mdash;is
all over?&mdash;all decided? is my de&s;tiny black and ire|ful
for ever?&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana &s;till more and more &s;truck with him,
looked down, internally uttering: &startq;Ah! were this
charming youth but $$a$ter of Beech Park!&endq;</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant, the rapid approach of a carriage
caught their ears; and eager to avoid making a de|ci&s;ive
reply, &s;he ran to the church-yard gate to look
at it, exclaiming: &startq;Dear! what an elegant cha|riot.&endq;
When it came up to the party, it &s;topt,
and, opening the door him&s;elf, Edgar jumped
ha&s;tily out of it.</P>
<P>The Oxonian &s;tood agha&s;t: but Indiana, &s;pring|ing
forward, and lo&s;ing in curio&s;ity every other &s;en|&s;ation,
<PB N="173" REF="173">
cried: &startq;Dear! Mr. Mandlebert, who&s;e
beautiful new carriage is that?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yours,&endq; an&s;wered he, gallantly, &startq;if you will
honour it with any commands.&endq;</P>
<P>She then ob&s;erved his cre&s;t and cypher were on
the pannels; and another entire new &s;et of ideas
took in&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind. She received
literally an an&s;wer which he had made in gay courte&s;y,
and held out her hand to be helped into the chariot.</P>
<P>Edgar, though &s;urpri&s;ed and even &s;tartled at this
unexpected appropriation of his civility, could not
recede; but the moment he had &s;eated her, ha&s;tily
turned round, to inquire who el&s;e was mo&s;t fatigued.</P>
<P>The Oxonian now felt lo&s;t! &s;uddenly, abruptly,
but irretrievably lo&s;t! The cypher he &s;aw&mdash;the
que&s;tion &startq;who&s;e carriage is that?&endq; he heard&mdash;the
an&s;wer &startq;<HI>yours</HI>&endq; made him ga&s;p for breath, and the
in&s;tantaneous acceptance &s;tung him to the &s;oul.
Wholly in de&s;peration, he ru&s;hed to the oppo&s;ite
window of the chariot, and calling out, &startq;Enough,
cruel!&mdash;cruel!&mdash;enough&mdash;I will &s;ee you no more!&endq;
hurried out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Indiana, who, for the fir&s;t time, thought her&s;elf
mi&s;tre&s;s of a new and elegant equipage, was &s;o
bu&s;ily employed in examining the trappings and the
lining, that &s;he bore his departure without a &s;igh;
though but an in&s;tant before it might have co&s;t her
&s;omething near one.</P>
<P>Eugenia had been touched more deeply. She
was ignorant of what had pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;he had &s;een
the agitation of Melmond, and the moment he di&s;|appeared,
&s;he ejaculated &s;ecretly: &startq;Ah! had he
conceived the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bellamy! where had
been my &s;teadine&s;s? where, O Clermont! thy &s;e|curity!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;crupulous delicacy of her mind was &s;hocked
at this &s;ugge&s;tion, and &s;he rejoiced &s;he had not been
put to &s;uch a trial.</P>
<P>Edgar now explained, that when he arrived at the
cottage, he found, as he had fore&s;een, the garden
chair waiting there, by mi&s;take, and Robert in
<PB N="174" REF="174">
much di&s;tre&s;s, having ju&s;t di&s;covered that an accident
had happened to one of the wheels. He had run
on, therefore, him&s;elf, to Beech Park, for his own
new chariot, which was lately arrived from town,
making Robert follow with Sir Hugh's hor&s;es, as his
own were out at gra&s;s.</P>
<P>It was dinner-time, and Sir Hugh, equally vexed
and fatigued, re&s;olved to return &s;traight home. He
accepted, therefore, a place in the chariot, bid Eu|genia
follow him, and Robert make ha&s;te; &s;olemnly
adding to the latter: &startq;I had fully intended making
you the proper lecture upon your not coming in
time; but as it has turned $ut not to be your fault,
on account of an accident, I &s;hall &s;ay no more; ex|cept
to give you a hint not to do &s;uch a thing again,
becau&s;e we have all been upon the point of being
to&s;&s;ed by a mad bull; which would certainly have
happened, but for the lucky chance of its turning
out a fal&s;e alarm.&endq;</P>
<P>The remainder of the party proceeded without
further adventure. Edgar attended Camilla; Mi&s;s
Margland adhered to Bellamy: Lionel, who dur&s;t
not venture at any new frolic, but with whom time
lingered when none was pa&s;&s;ing, retreated; Dr.
Marchmont, who was near his home, &s;oon al&s;o made
his bow; and Dr. Orkborne, who was glad to be
alone, ruminated with wonder upon what appeared
to him a phenomenon, a man of learning who could
deign to plea&s;e and &s;eem plea&s;ed where books were
not the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and where &s;chola&s;tic at|tainments
were not required to elucidate a &s;ingle
&s;entence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Two Ways of looking at the &s;ame Thing.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the party arrived at Cleves, Camilla,
who had ob&s;erved that Edgar &s;eemed much di&s;ap|pointed
<PB N="175" REF="175">
by the breaking up of the cottage expedi|tion,
propo&s;ed that it &s;hould take place in the even|ing;
and her uncle, though too much fatigued to
venture out again him&s;elf, con&s;ented, or rather in|$i&s;ted,
that the excur&s;ion &s;hould be made without
him.</P>
<P>Before they &s;et out, Edgar de&s;ired to &s;peak with
Sir Hugh in private.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh concluded it was to make his propo&s;als
of marriage for Indiana; and had not patience to
&s;tep into his own apartment, but told them all to re|tire,
with a nod at Indiana, which prepared not only
her&s;elf but Mi&s;s Margland, Camilla, and Eugenia
to join in his expectation.</P>
<P>Indiana, though a good deal fluttered, flew to a
window, to &s;ee if the new chariot was in &s;ight; and
then, turning to Mi&s;s Margland, a&s;ked, &startq;Pray,
&s;hould I refu&s;e him at fir&s;t?&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland &s;pared not for proper in&s;tructions;
and immediately began a negociation with the fair
que&s;tioner, for continuing to live with her.</P>
<P>Eugenia was occupied in reflecting with pity upon
the idlene&s;s of Indiana, which &s;o ill had fitted her
for becoming the companion of Mandlebert.</P>
<P>Camilla, unu&s;ually thoughtful, walked alone into
the garden, and &s;ought a path lea&s;t in &s;ight.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, meanwhile, was mo&s;t unplea&s;antly un|deceived.
Edgar, without naming Indiana, in|formed
him of the &s;ituation in which he had &s;ur|pri&s;ed
Bellamy, and of his &s;u&s;picions with regard to
the de&s;tination of the chai&s;e, but for his own timely
arrival at the farm-hou&s;e; adding, that his gratitude
to Mr. Tyrold, his re&s;pect for him&s;elf, and his affec|tion
for all the family, made him think it his duty to
reveal the&s;e circum&s;tances without delay.</P>
<P>The baronet &s;huddered with horror; and de|clared
he would in&s;tantly &s;end an expre&s;s to bring
Clermont home, that Eugenia might be married out
of hand; and, in the mean time, that he would
have every window in the hou&s;e barred, and keep her
lo$ked up in her room.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="176">
Edgar di&s;&s;uaded him from &s;o violent a mea&s;ure;
but advi&s;ed him to &s;peak with his niece upon the
danger &s;he had probably e&s;caped, and of which &s;he
&s;eemed wholly uncon&s;cious; to prevail with her not
to go out again this evening, and to &s;end for Mr.
Tyrold, and acquaint him with the affair.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh thanked him for his coun&s;el, and im|plicitly
acted by his opinion.</P>
<P>He then ordered the coach for Mi&s;s Margland,
Indiana, and Camilla.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, finding neither Sir Hugh nor Eu|genia
of the party, declined joining it. Lionel was
returned to Etherington; and Edgar rode on
before, to invite Dr. Marchmont, with the con&s;ent
of the Baronet, to take the fourth place in the
carriage.</P>
<P>Arrived at the rectory, he went &s;traight, by pre|&s;criptive
privilege, into the &s;tudy of Dr. March|mont,
whom he found immer&s;ed in books and pa|pers,
which, immediately, at the reque&s;t of Edgar,
he put a&s;ide; not without regret to quit them,
though wholly without reluctance to oblige.</P>
<P>Edgar had ridden &s;o hard, that they had &s;ome
time to wait for the coach. But he did not appear
anxious for its arrival; though he wore a look that
was far from implying him to be free from anxiety.</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent,&mdash;he hemmed,&mdash;he was &s;ilent again,
&mdash;and again he hemmed,&mdash;and then, gently laying
his hand upon the &s;houlder of the Doctor, while his
eyes, full of meaning, were fixed upon his face;
&startq;Doctor,&endq; he cried, &startq;you would hardly have
known the&s;e young ladies?&mdash;they are all grown
from children into women &s;ince you &s;aw them la&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&endq; an&s;wered the Doctor, &startq;and very
charming women. Indiana has a beauty &s;o exqui|&s;ite,
it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to look away from it a mo|ment:
Eugenia joins &s;o much innocence with infor|mation,
that the mind mu&s;t it&s;elf be deformed that
could dwell upon her per&s;onal defects, after conver&s;|ing
with her: Camilla&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="177">
He pau&s;ed, and Edgar ha&s;tily turned another
way, not to look at him, nor be looked at, while
he proceeded:</P>
<P>&startq;Camilla,&endq; he pre&s;ently continued, &startq;&s;eems the
mo&s;t inartificially &s;weet, the mo&s;t unobtru&s;ively gay,
and the mo&s;t attractively lovely of almo&s;t any young
creature I ever beheld.&endq;</P>
<P>With a heart all expanded, and a face full of &s;en|&s;ibility,
Edgar now turned to him, and &s;eizing, in|voluntarily,
his hand, which he eagerly &s;hook, &startq;You
think her, then,&endq;&mdash;he cried,&mdash;but &s;uddenly &s;topt,
dropt his hand, coughed two or three times; and,
taking out his pocket handkerchief, &s;eemed tor|mented
with a violent cold.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont affectionately embraced him.
&startq;My dear young friend,&endq; he cried, &startq;I &s;ee the
&s;ituation of your mind&mdash;and think every po&s;&s;ible
happine&s;s promi&s;es to be yours; yet, if you have
taken no po&s;itive &s;tep, &s;uffer me to &s;peak with you
before you proceed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Far from having taken any po&s;itive &s;tep, I have
not yet even formed any re&s;olution.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the carriage &s;topt for the Doctor, who re|peated,
&startq;Yes! I think every po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s
promi&s;es to be yours!&endq; before he went on to the
ladies. Edgar, in a trepidation too great to be &s;een
by them, kept behind till they drove off, though he
then gallopped &s;o fa&s;t, that he arrived at the cottage
before them: the words, &startq;I think every po&s;&s;ible
happine&s;s promi&s;es to be yours,&endq; vibrating the whole
time in his ears.</P>
<P>When the coach arrived, Edgar handed out Mi&s;s
Margland and Indiana; leaving Camilla to the Doc|tor;
willing to let him &s;ee more of her, and by no
means di&s;plea&s;ed to avoid his eyes at that moment
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Indiana was in the mo&s;t &s;prightly &s;pirits &s;he had
ever experienced; &s;he concluded her&s;elf on the verge
of becoming mi&s;tre&s;s of a fine place and a large for|tune;
&s;he had received adulation all the morning that
had rai&s;ed her beauty higher than ever in her own
<PB N="178" REF="178">
e&s;timation; and &s;he &s;ecretly revolved, with delight,
various articles of ornament and of luxury, which
&s;he had long wi&s;hed to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which now, for
her wedding clothes, &s;he &s;hould have riches &s;ufficient
to purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, too, was all &s;moothne&s;s, com|placency,
and courte&s;y.</P>
<P>Camilla, alone, was grave; Camilla, who, by
nature, alone was gay.</P>
<P>&startq;Dear! is this the cottage we have been coming
to all this time?&endq; cried Indiana, upon entering;
&startq;Lord! I thought it would have been &s;omething
quite pretty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what &s;ort of prettine&s;s,&endq; &s;aid Edgar,
&startq;did you expect from a cottage?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear, I don't know&mdash;but I thought we were
come on purpo&s;e to &s;ee &s;omething extraordinary?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who followed, made an exclamation far
different; an exclamation of plea&s;ure, &s;urpri&s;e, and
vivacity, that re&s;tored for an in&s;tant, all her native
gaiety: for no &s;ooner had &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold,
than &s;he recogni&s;ed, in a woman who was curt&s;ying
low to receive her, and whom Indiana had pa&s;&s;ed
without ob&s;erving, the wi&s;e of the poor pri&s;oner for
whom &s;he had interceded with Mandlebert.</P>
<P>&startq;How I rejoice to &s;ee you!&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;and
to &s;ee you here! and how much better you look!
and how comfortable you &s;eem! I hope you are now
all well?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, madam,&endq; an&s;wered the woman; &startq;we
owe every thing to that good young gentleman! he
has put us in this nice new cottage, and employs us
in his &s;ervice. Ble&s;&s;ings on his head! I am &s;ure he
will be paid for it!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, &s;omewhat agitated, occupied him&s;elf with
jumping the little boy; Camilla looked round with
rapture; Indiana &s;eemed wonder-&s;truck, without
knowing why; Dr. Marchmont narrowly watched
them all; and Mi&s;s Margland, expecting a new col|lection
would be next propo&s;ed for &s;etting them up,
<PB N="179" REF="179">
nimbly recro&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold, to examine the pro&s;|pect
without.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band, now in decent garb, and much re|covered,
though &s;till weak and emaciated; advanced
to Camilla, to make his humble acknowledgments,
that &s;he had recommended them to their kind bene|factor.</P>
<P>&startq;No!&endq; cried Camilla; &startq;you owe me nothing!
your own di&s;tre&s;s recommended you;&mdash;your own
di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;and Mr. Mandlebert's genero&s;ity.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, going up to Edgar, &startq;It is your happy
fate,&endq; &s;he &s;aid, in an accent of admiration, &startq;to act
all that my father &s;o often plans and wi&s;hes, but
which his income will not allow him to execute.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;ee,&endq; an&s;wered he, gratefully, &startq;how
little &s;uffices for content! I have &s;carce done any
thing&mdash;yet how relieved, how &s;atisfied are the&s;e poor
people! This hut was fortunately vacant&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;O, madam!&endq; interrupted the poor woman,
&startq;if you knew but how that good gentleman has
done it all! how kindly he has u&s;ed us, and made
every body el&s;e u&s;e us! and let nobody taunt us with
our bad faults!&mdash;and what good he has done to my
poor &s;ick hu&s;band! and how he has clothed my poor
little half naked children! and, what is more than
all, &s;aved us from the &s;hame of an ill life.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Camilla felt the tears &s;tart into her eyes;&mdash;&s;he
ha&s;tily &s;natched the little babe into her arms; and,
while her ki&s;&s;es hid her face, Happy, and thrice
happy Indiana! with a &s;oft &s;igh, was the &s;ilent eja|culation
of her heart.</P>
<P>She &s;eated her&s;elf on a &s;tool, and, without &s;peak|ing
or hearing any thing more, devoted her&s;elf to
the baby.</P>
<P>Indiana, meanwhile, who&s;e confidence in her own
&s;ituation gave her courage to utter whatever fir&s;t oc|curred
to her, having made a general &s;urvey of the
place and people, with an air of di&s;appointment,
now amu&s;ed her&s;elf with an in&s;pection more minute,
taking up and ca&s;ting down every thing that was
portable, without any regard either to deranging its
<PB N="180" REF="180">
neatne&s;s, or endangering its &s;afety:&mdash;exclaiming, as
&s;he made her round of inve&s;tigation, &startq;Dear!
Crockery ware! how ugly!&mdash;Lord, what little
mean chairs!&mdash;Is that your be&s;t gown, good wo|man?
&mdash;Dear, what an ugly pattern!&mdash;Well, I
would not wear &s;uch a thing to &s;ave my life!&mdash;Have
you got nothing better than this for a floor-cloth?&mdash;
Only look at tho&s;e curtains! Did you ever &s;ee &s;uch
frights?&mdash;Lord! do you eat off the&s;e platters? I
am &s;ure I could &s;ooner die! I &s;hould not mind
&s;tarving half as much!&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, hoping the collection was now
either made or relinqui&s;hed, ventured to re-enter,
and inquire if they never meant to return home?
Camilla unwillingly gave up the baby; but would
not depart without looking over the cottage, where
every thing &s;he &s;aw excited a &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure.
&startq;How neat is this! How tidy that!&endq; were her
continual exclamations; &startq;How bright you have
rubbed your &s;aucepans! How clean every thing is
all round! How &s;oon you will all get well in this
healthy and comfortable little dwelling!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, in a low voice, then told Dr. March|mont
the hi&s;tory of his new cottagers, &s;aying:
&startq;You will not, I hope, di&s;approve what I have
done? Their natures &s;eemed &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to
good, I could not bear to let their wants turn them
again to evil.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have certainly done right,&endq; an&s;wered the
Doctor; &startq;to give money without inquiry, or further
aid, to tho&s;e who have adopted bad practices, is, to
them, but temptation, and to &s;ociety an injury; but
to give them both the coun&s;el and the means to pur|&s;ue
a right cour&s;e, is, to them, perhaps, &s;alvation,
and to the community, the greate&s;t &s;ervice.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana and Mi&s;s Margland, quite wearied, both
got into the carriage; Edgar, having depo&s;ited
them, returned to Camilla, who ki&s;&s;ed both the
children, poured forth good wi&s;hes upon the father
and mother; and, then, gave him her hand. En|chanted,
<PB N="181" REF="181">
he took it, exclaiming; &startq;Ah! who is
like you! &s;o lively&mdash;yet &s;o feeling!&endq;</P>
<P>Struck and penetrated, &s;he made no an&s;wer:
Alas! &s;he thought, I fear he is not quite &s;atisfied
with Indiana!</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont was &s;et down at his own hou&s;e;
where, he begged to have a conference with Edgar
the next morning.</P>
<P>The whole way home, the benevolence of Edgar
occupied the mind of Camilla; and, not in the pre|&s;ent
in&s;tance, the le&s;s, that its object had been ori|ginally
of her own pointing out.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Two R$treats.</HEAD>
<P>MR. and Mrs. Tyrold had obeyed the &s;ummons
of Sir Hugh, whom they found in extreme tribula|tion;
per&s;uaded by his fears not only of the de&s;ign
of Bellamy, but of its inevitable &s;ucce&s;s. His bro|ther,
however, who knew his alarms to be generally
as unfounded as his hopes; and Mrs. Tyrold, who
almo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;edly de&s;pi&s;ed both; no &s;ooner heard
his account, than, declining to di&s;cu&s;s it, they &s;ent
for Eugenia. She related the tran&s;action with a
confu&s;ion &s;o innocent, that it was ea&s;y to di&s;cern
&s;hame alone had hitherto cau&s;ed her &s;ilence; and
with a &s;implicity &s;o unaffected, that not a doubt
could re&s;t upon their minds, but that her heart was
as di&s;engaged as her intentions had been irreproach|able.
Yet they were not the le&s;s &s;truck with the
danger &s;he had incurred; and, while her father
ble&s;&s;ed Mandlebert for her pre&s;ervation, her mother
was &s;o &s;en&s;ible to his care for the family welfare and
honour, that the anger &s;he had conceived again&s;t
him &s;ub&s;ided, though the regret to which it had
owed its birth increa&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="182">
Mr. Tyrold gave his daughter &s;ome &s;light cau|tions
and general advice; but thought it wi&s;e&s;t, &s;ince
he found her tranquil and un&s;u&s;picious, not to rai&s;e
apprehen&s;ions that might di&s;turb her compo&s;ure, nor
awaken ideas of which the termination mu&s;t be
doubtful.</P>
<P>Her mother deemed the matter to be unde&s;erving
the lea&s;t &s;erious alarm. The man had appeared to
her from the beginning to be a de&s;picable adven|turer;
and her lofty contempt of all low arts made
her conclude her well-principled Eugenia as &s;uperior
to their &s;nares as to their practice.</P>
<P>This conference completely quieted the fears of
Sir Hugh; who relinqui&s;hed his de&s;ign of &s;ending
for Clermont, and imagined Edgar to have been too
&s;evere in his judgment of Bellamy, who had only
knelt in pure compa&s;&s;ion, to prevail with Eugenia
to take care of her life.</P>
<P>The rector and his lady were already gone before
the cottage group came home. Edgar was anxious
to inquire of Sir Hugh what had pa&s;&s;ed. The
three females, concluding he had &s;till &s;omething to
&s;ay relative to his propo&s;als, by tacit agreement, re|tired
to their own rooms.</P>
<P>They were not, however, as concurrent in their
eagerne&s;s to re-a&s;&s;emble. Mi&s;s Margland and In|diana
watched the moment when they might appea&s;e
their burning curio&s;ity by de&s;cending; but Eugenia
wi&s;hed to prolong her ab&s;ence, that &s;he might re|cover
from the embarra&s;&s;ment &s;he had ju&s;t &s;uffered;
and Camilla determined not to appear again till the
next morning.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t time in her life after the &s;horte&s;t &s;e|paration,
&s;he forbore to &s;eek Eugenia, whom &s;he
&s;uppo&s;ed would have gathered all the particulars of
the approaching nuptials. She felt no de&s;ire to hear
them. It was a period to which, hitherto, &s;he had
looked forward as to a thing of cour&s;e; but this day
it had &s;truck her that Edgar and Indiana could not
be happy together.&mdash;She had even &s;urmi&s;ed, from
<PB N="183" REF="183">
his la&s;t &s;peech, that he lamented, in &s;ecret, the con|nexion
he had formed.</P>
<P>The gentle&s;t pity took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her brea&s;t;
an increa&s;ing admiration &s;ucceeded to her pity. She
could not bear to witne&s;s &s;o unequal a &s;cene, as the
full &s;atisfaction of Sir Hugh contra&s;ted with the &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s,
perhaps repentance, of Edgar. She
pleaded an head-ache, and went to bed.</P>
<P>The morning did not find her le$s aver&s;e to hear
the confirmation of the &s;u&s;pected news. On the
contrary, her repugnance to have it a&s;certained be|came
&s;tronger. She did not a&s;k her&s;elf why; &s;he
did not con&s;ider the u&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of flying for one hour
what &s;he mu&s;t encounter the next. The pre&s;ent mo|ment
was all &s;he could weigh; and, to procra&s;tinate
any evil, &s;eemed, to her ardent and active imagina|tion,
to conquer it. Again, therefore, &s;he planned
a vi&s;it to Mrs. Arlbery; though &s;he had given it up
$o long, from the di&s;couragement of Lionel, that
&s;he felt more of &s;hame than of plea&s;ure in the idea of
making &s;o tardy an apology; but &s;he could think of
no other place to which the whole party would not
accompany her; and to avoid them and their com|munications,
for however &s;hort a &s;pace of time, was
now her &s;ole aim.</P>
<P>Before breakfa&s;t, &s;he repaired to the apartment
of her uncle; her reque&s;t was granted, as &s;oon as
heard; and &s;he ordered the chai&s;e.</P>
<P>Indiana and Mi&s;s Margland, meanwhile, had learnt
from the baronet, that the propo&s;als were not yet
made. Mi&s;s Margland &s;oftened the di&s;appointment
of Indiana, by &s;ugge&s;ting that her admirer was pro|bably
waiting the arrival of &s;ome elegant trinket,
that he de&s;tined to pre&s;ent her upon his declaration:
but &s;he was by no means free from doubt and &s;ufpi|cion
her&s;elf. She langui&s;hed to quit Cleves, and Sir
Hugh had almo&s;t thought her accountable for the
&s;lowne&s;s of Mandlebert's proceedings. To keep up
her own con&s;equence, &s;he had again repeated her a&s;|&s;urances,
that all was in a pro&s;perous train; though
&s;he had frequently, with &s;trong private unea&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="184" REF="184">
ob&s;erved the eyes of Edgar fixed upon Camilla, with
an attention far more pointed than &s;he had ever re|marked
in them when their direction was towards
her fair pupil.</P>
<P>Camilla hurried over her breakfa&s;t in expectation
of the chai&s;e, and in dread continual, le&s;t her cou&s;in
&s;hould call her a&s;ide, to acquaint her that all was ar|ranged.
Edgar perceived, with &s;urpri&s;e, that &s;he
was going out alone; and, no &s;ooner gathered whi|ther,
than, drawing her to one of the windows, he
earne&s;tly &s;aid: &startq;Is it by appointment you wait upon
Mrs. Arlbery?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Does &s;he at all expect you this morning?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Would it, then, be a&s;king too much, if I &s;hould
intreat you to po&s;tpone your vi&s;it for a &s;hort time?&endq;</P>
<P>The whole de&s;ign of Camilla was to ab&s;ent her|&s;elf
immediately; yet &s;he hated to &s;ay no. She
looked di&s;turbed, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>&startq;Have you made any further acquaintance with
her &s;ince the morning of the raffle?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, none; but I wi&s;h exce&s;&s;ively to know more
of her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She is certainly, very&mdash;agreeable,&endq; &s;aid he, with
&s;ome he&s;itation; &startq;but, whether &s;he is all Mrs. Ty|rold
would approve&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I hope you know no harm of her?&mdash;If you do,
pray keep it to your&s;elf!&mdash;for it would quite afflict
me to hear any thing to her di&s;advantage.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould be grieved, indeed, to be the me&s;&s;enger
of affliction to you; but I hope there may be no
occa&s;ion; I only beg a day or two's patience; and,
in the mean while, I can give you this a&s;&s;urance;
&s;he is undoubtedly a woman of character. I &s;aw
&s;he had charmed you, and I made &s;ome immediate
inquiries. Her reputation is without taint.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A thou&s;and, thou&s;and thanks,&endq; cried Camilla,
gaily, &startq;for taking &s;o much trouble; and ten thou|&s;and
more for finding it needle&s;s!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="185">
Edgar could not forbear laughing, but an&s;wered,
he was not yet &s;o certain it was needle&s;s; &s;ince ex|emption
from actual blemi&s;h could only be a negative
recommendation; he &s;hould very &s;oon, he added,
&s;ee a lady upon who&s;e judgment he could rely, and
who would frankly &s;atisfy him with re&s;pect to &s;ome
other particulars, which, he owned, he con&s;idered
as e&s;&s;ential to be known, before any intimacy
&s;hould be formed.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hing to comply with his reque&s;t, yet impatient
to leave the hou&s;e, Camilla &s;tood &s;u&s;pended till the
chai&s;e was announced.</P>
<P>&startq;I think,&endq; cried &s;he, with a look and tone of ir|re&s;olution,
&startq;my going this once can draw on no ill
con&s;equence?&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar only dropt his eyes.</P>
<P>&startq;You are not of that opinion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have a very particular engagement this morn|ing,&endq;
he replied; &startq;but I will readily give it up,
and ride off in&s;tantly to make my application to this
lady, if it is po&s;&s;ible you can defer only till to-mor|row
your vi&s;it. Will you &s;uffer me to a&s;k &s;uch a
delay? It will greatly oblige me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then,&mdash;I will defer it till to-morrow,&mdash;
or till to-morrow week!&endq; cried &s;he wholly vanqui&s;h|ed;
&startq;I in&s;i&s;t, therefore, that you do not po&s;t|pone
your bu&s;ine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired the &s;ervant, who was taking away
the breakfa&s;t equipage, to order the chai&s;e to be put up.</P>
<P>Edgar, &s;ubdued in his turn, caught her hand;
but, in&s;tantly recollecting him&s;elf, ha&s;tily let it go;
and, throwing up the window &s;a&s;h, abruptly ex|claimed;
&startq;I never &s;aw &s;uch fine weather;&mdash;I hope
it will not rain!&endq;</P>
<P>He then rapidly wi&s;hed them all good morning,
and mounted his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, who, &s;ideling towards the win|dow,
on pretence of examining a print, had heard
and &s;een all that had pa&s;&s;ed, was almo&s;t overpowered
with rage, by the conviction &s;he received that her
apprehen&s;ions were not groundle&s;s. She feared lo&s;ing
<PB N="186" REF="186">
all weight both with the baronet and with Indiana,
if &s;he made this acknowledgment, and retreated,
confounded, to her own room, to con&s;ider what path
to pur&s;ue at &s;o dangerous a cri&s;is; wearing a &s;cowl
upon her face, that was always an indication &s;he
would not be followed.</P>
<P>Camilla al&s;o went to her chamber, in a perturba|tion
at once plea&s;ing and painful. She was &s;orry
to have mi&s;&s;ed her ex$ur&s;ion, but &s;he was happy to
have obliged Edgar; &s;he was delighted he could take
&s;uch intere&s;t in her conduct and affairs, yet dreaded,
more than ever, a private conver&s;ation with In|diana;
&mdash;Indiana, who, every moment, appeared to
her le&s;s and le&s;s calculated to be&s;tow felicity upon
Edgar Mandlebert.</P>
<P>She &s;eated her&s;elf at a window, and &s;oon, through
the trees, perceived him gallopping away. &startq;Too&mdash;
too amiable Edgar!&endq; &s;he cried, earne&s;tly looking
after him, with her hands cla&s;ped, and tears &s;tarting
into her eyes.</P>
<P>Frightened at her own tenderne&s;s, &s;he ro&s;e, &s;hut
the window, and walked to another end of the
apartment.</P>
<P>She took up a book; but &s;he could not read:
&startq;Too&mdash;too amiable Edgar!&endq; again e&s;caped her.
She went to her piano forte; &s;he could not play:
&startq;Too&mdash;too amiable Edgar!&endq; broke forth in de|fiance
of all &s;truggle.</P>
<P>Alarmed and a&s;hamed, even to her&s;elf, &s;he re|&s;olved
to di&s;&s;ipate her ideas by a long walk; and
not to come out of the park, till the fir&s;t dinner-bell
&s;ummoned her to dre&s;s.</P>

<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Two Sides of a Que&s;tion.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of Edgar had been to ride to Mrs.
Needham, the lady of whom he meant to a&s;k the
<PB N="187" REF="187">
information to which he had alluded; but a charm
too potent for re&s;i&s;tance demanded his immediate li|beration
from the promi&s;e to Dr. Marchmont, which
bound him to proceed no further till they had again
conver&s;ed together.</P>
<P>He gallopped, therefore, to the par&s;onage hou&s;e
of Cleves, and entering the &s;tudy of the Doctor,
and taking him by the hand, with the mo&s;t animated
ge&s;ture; &startq;My dear and honoured friend,&endq; he cried,
&startq;I come to you now without he&s;itation, and free
from every painful embarra&s;&s;ment of lurking irre&s;o|lution!
I come to you decided, and upon grounds
which cannot offend you, though the deci&s;ion anti|cipates
your coun&s;el. I come to you, in fine, my
dear Doctor, my good and kind friend, to confe&s;s
that ye&s;terday you &s;aw right, with regard to the
&s;ituation of my mind, and that, to-day, I have only
your felicitations to beg, upon my confirmed, my
irrevocable choice!&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont embraced him: &startq;May you then,&endq;
he cried, &startq;be as happy, my dear young friend, as
you de&s;erve! I can wi&s;h you nothing higher.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;La&s;t night,&endq; continued Edgar, &startq;I felt all
doubt die away: captivating as I have ever thought
her, &s;o &s;oft, &s;o gentle, &s;o touchingly &s;weet, as la&s;t
night, I had never yet beheld her; you witne&s;&s;ed it,
my dear Doctor? you &s;aw her with the baby in her
arms? how beautiful, how endearing a &s;ight!&endq;</P>
<P>The Doctor looked a&s;&s;entingly, but did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>&startq;Yet even la&s;t night was &s;hort of the feelings &s;he
excited this morning. My dear friend! &s;he was
upon the point of making an excur&s;ion from which
&s;he had promi&s;ed her&s;elf peculiar plea&s;ure, and to
&s;ee a lady for whom &s;he has conceived the warme&s;t
admiration&mdash;I begged her to po&s;tpone&mdash;perhaps re|linqui&s;h
entirely the vi&s;it&mdash;&s;he had obtained leave
from Sir Hugh&mdash;the carriage was at the door&mdash;
would you, could you believe &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s with
&s;uch vivacity? &s;he complied with my reque&s;t, and
complied with a grace that has rivetted her&mdash;I own
it&mdash;that has rivetted her to my &s;oul!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="188">
Doctor Marchmont &s;miled, but rather pen&s;ively
than rejoicingly; and Edgar, receiving no an&s;wer,
walked for &s;ome time about the room, &s;ilently en|joying
his own thoughts.</P>
<P>Returning then to the Doctor, &startq;My dear friend,&endq;
he cried, &startq;I under&s;tood you wi&s;hed to &s;peak with me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes&mdash;but I thought you di&s;engaged.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So, except mentally, I am &s;till.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Does &s;he not yet know her conque&s;t?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She does not even gue&s;s it.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont now ri&s;ing, with much energy
&s;aid: &startq;Hear me then, my dear and mo&s;t valued
young friend; forbear to declare your&s;elf, make no
overtures to her relations, rai&s;e no expectations even
in her own brea&s;t, and let not rumour &s;urmi&s;e your
pa&s;&s;ion to the world, till her heart is better known
to you.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, &s;tarting and amazed, with great emotion
exclaimed: &startq;What do you mean, my good Doctor?
do you &s;u&s;pect any prior engagement? any fatal pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;u&s;pect nothing. I do not know her. I
mean not, therefore, the propen&s;ities alone, but the
worth, al&s;o, of her heart; deception is ea&s;y, and
I mu&s;t not &s;ee you thrown away.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let me, then, be her guarantee!&endq; cried Edgar,
with firmne&s;s; &startq;for I know her well! I have known
her from her childhood, and cannot be deceived. I
fear nothing&mdash;except my own powers of engaging
her regard. I can trace to a certainty, even from
my boyi&s;h remarks, her fair, open, artle&s;s, and di&s;|intere&s;ted
character.&endq;</P>
<P>He then gave a recital of the noble$$e&s;s of her
&s;entiments and conduct when only nine years old;
contra&s;ting the relation with the &s;ullen and ungener|ous
behaviour of Indiana at the fame age.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont li&s;tened to the account with at|tention
and plea&s;ure, but not with an air of that full
conviction which Edgar expected. &startq;All this,&endq; he
&s;aid, &startq;is highly prophetic of good, and confirms
<PB N="189" REF="189">
me in the opinion I expre&s;&s;ed la&s;t night, that every
po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s promi&s;es to be yours.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yet, &s;till,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, a little chagrined, &startq;there
&s;eems &s;ome drawback to your entire approbation?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To your choice I have none.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You perplex me, Doctor! I know not to what
you object, what you would intimate, nor what
propo&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All I have to &s;ugge&s;t may be compri&s;ed in two
points: Fir&s;t, That you will refu&s;e confirmation
even to your own intentions, till you have po&s;itively
a&s;certained her actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e virtues with
which &s;he appears to be endowed: and &s;econdly,
That if you find her gifted with them all, you will
not &s;olicit her acceptance till you are &s;atisfied of her
affection.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Doctor,&endq; cried Edgar, half laugh|ing,
&startq;from what an alarm of wild conjecture has
your explanation relieved me! Hear me, however,
in return, and I think I can &s;atisfy you, that, even
upon your own conditions, not an ob&s;tacle &s;tands in
the way of my &s;peaking to Mr. Tyrold this very
evening.</P>
<P>&startq;With regard to your fir&s;t article,&endq; her virtues, I
have told you the dawning &s;uperiority of her mo&s;t
juvenile ideas of right; and though I have latterly
lo&s;t &s;ight of her, by travelling during our vacations,
I know her to have always been under the &s;uperin|tendance
of one of the fir&s;t of women; and for the&s;e
la&s;t three weeks, which I have &s;pent under the &s;ame
roof with her, I have ob&s;erved her to be all that is
amiable, &s;weet, natural, and generous. What then
on this point remains? Nothing. I am irrefragably
convinced of her worth.</P>
<P>&startq;With re&s;pect to your &s;econd condition, I own
you a little embarra&s;s me; yet how may I inquire
into the &s;tate of her affections, without acknowledg|ing
her mi&s;tre&s;s of mine?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hold! hold!&endq; interrupted the Doctor, &startq;you
proceed too rapidly. The fir&s;t article is all un&s;et|tled,
while you are flying to the la&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="190">
&startq;It is true,&endq; and I again repeat it, every promi&s;e
is in your favour; but do not mi&s;take promi&s;e for
performance. This young lady appears to be all ex|cellence;
for an acquaintance, for a friend, I doubt
not you have already &s;een enough to e&s;tabli&s;h her in
your good opinion; but &s;ince it is only within a few
hours you have taken the re&s;olution which is to em|power
her to colour the re&s;t of your life, you mu&s;t
&s;tudy her, from this moment, with new eyes, new
ears, and new thoughts. Whatever &s;he does, you
mu&s;t a&s;k your&s;elf this que&s;tion: &startq;Should I like
&s;uch behaviour in my wife?&endq; Whatever &s;he &s;ays, you
mu&s;t make your&s;elf the &s;ame demand. Nothing mu&s;t
e&s;cape you; you mu&s;t view as if you had never &s;een
her before; the interrogatory, <HI>Were &s;he mine?</HI> mu&s;t
be pre&s;ent at every look, every word, every motion;
you mu&s;t forget her wholly as Camilla Tyrold, you
mu&s;t think of her only as Camilla Mandlebert; even
ju&s;tice is in&s;ufficient during this period of probation,
and in&s;tead of inquiring, &startq;Is this right in her?&endq;
you mu&s;t &s;imply a&s;k, &startq;Would it be plea&s;ing to me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are apprehen&s;ive, then, of &s;ome di&s;&s;imili|tude
of character prejudicial to our future happine&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not of character; you have been very pecu|liarly
&s;ituated for obviating all ri&s;k upon that fir&s;t and
mo&s;t important particular. I have no doubt of her
general worthine&s;s; but though e&s;teem hangs wholly
upon character, happine&s;s always links it&s;elf with
di&s;po&s;ition.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You gratify me, Doctor, by naming di&s;po|&s;ition,
for I can give you the mo&s;t unequivocal a&s;&s;ur|ance
of her &s;weetne&s;s, her innocence, her benevolence,
joined to a &s;pirit of never-dying vivacity&mdash;an anima|tion
of never-cea&s;ing good humour!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know you, my dear Mandlebert, to be, by
nature, penetrating and minute in your ob&s;ervations;
which, in your general commerce with the world,
will protect both your under&s;tanding and your affec|tions
from the u&s;ual &s;nares of youth: But here&mdash;to
be even &s;crupulous is not enough; to avoid all dan|ger
<PB N="191" REF="191">
of repentance, you mu&s;t become po&s;itively di&s;|tru&s;tful.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never, Doctor, never! I would &s;ooner renounce
every pro&s;pect of felicity, than act a part &s;o unge|nerous,
where I am con&s;cious of &s;uch de&s;ert! Upon
this article, therefore, we have done; I am already
and fully convinced of her excellence. But, with
re&s;pect to your &s;econd difficulty, that I will not &s;eek
her acceptance, till &s;atisfied of her regard&mdash;there&mdash;
indeed, you &s;tart an idea that comes home to my &s;oul
in its very inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es! O Doctor!&mdash;could I
hope&mdash;however di&s;tantly&mdash;dur&s;t I hope&mdash;the inde|pendent,
un&s;olicited, involuntary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that
mo&s;t ingenuous, mo&s;t inartificial of human hearts!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And why not? why, while &s;o liberally you do
ju&s;tice to another, &s;hould you not learn to appreciate
your &s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>A look of elation, delight, and happine&s;s con|veyed
to Dr. Marchmont his pupil's grateful &s;en&s;e
of this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>&startq;I do not fear making you vain,&endq; he continued;
&startq;I know your under&s;tanding to be too &s;olid, and
your temperament too philo&s;ophic, to endanger your
running into the common futility of priding your&s;elf
upon the gifts of nature, any more than upon tho&s;e
of fortune; 'tis in their u&s;es only you can claim any
applau&s;e. I will not, therefore, &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert,
you can hardly any where propo&s;e your&s;elf with
much danger of being rejected. You are amiable
and accompli&s;hed; abounding in wealth, high in
character; in per&s;on $$d appearance unexception|able;
you can have no doubt of the joyful appro|bation
of her friends, nor can you entertain a rea|&s;onable
fear of her concurrence; yet, with all this,
pardon me, when I plainly, explicitly add, it is very
po&s;&s;ible you may be utterly indifferent to her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If &s;o, at lea&s;t,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, in a tone and with
a countenance whence all $lation was flown, &startq;&s;he
will leave me ma&s;ter of my&s;elf; &s;he is too noble to
&s;uffer any &s;ordid motives to unite us.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="192">
&startq;Do not depend upon that; the influence of
friends, the prevalence of example, the early no|tion
which every female imbibes that a good e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
mu&s;t be her fir&s;t object in life&mdash;the&s;e are
motives of marriage commonly &s;ufficient for the
whole &s;ex.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Her choice, indeed,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, thought|fully,
&startq;would not, perhaps, be wholly uninfluenced;
I pretend not to doubt that the voice of her friends
would be all in my favour.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&endq; interrupted Dr. Marchmont, &startq;and, be
&s;he noble as &s;he may, Beech-Park will be al&s;o in
your favour! your man&s;ion, your equipage, your do|me&s;tics,
even your table, will be in your favour&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Doctor,&endq; interrupted Edgar, in his turn, &startq;I
know you think ill of women.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do not let that idea weaken what I urge; I
have not had rea&s;on to think well of them; yet I
believe there are individuals who merit every regard:
your Camilla may be one of them. Take, however,
this warning from my experience; whatever is her
appearance of worth, try and prove its foundation,
ere you conclude it invulnerable; and whatever are
your preten&s;ions to her hand, do not nece&s;&s;arily con|nect
them with your chances for her heart.&endq;</P>
<P>Mandlebert, filled now with a di&s;tru&s;t of him&s;elf
and of his powers, which he was incapable of har|bouring
of Camilla and her magnanimity, felt &s;truck
to the &s;oul with the apprehen&s;ion of failing to gain
her affection, and wounded in every point both of
honour and delicacy, from the bare &s;ugge&s;tion of
owing his wife to his &s;ituation in the world. He
found no longer any difficulty in promi&s;ing not to act
with precipitance; his confidence was gone; his ele|vation
of &s;entiment was depre&s;&s;ed; a general mi&s;t
clouded his pro&s;pects, and a &s;u&s;pen&s;ive di&s;comfort in|quieted
his mind. He &s;hook Dr. Marchmont by
the hand, and a&s;&s;uring him he would weigh well all
he had &s;aid, and take no mea&s;ure till he had again
<PB REF="193">
con&s;ulted with him, remounted his hor&s;e, and
&s;lowly walked it back to Cleves.</P>
