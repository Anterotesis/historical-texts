<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER expre&s;&s;ing my Gratitude to the Pub|lick for the kind reception they have given to Mi&s;s Honeycombe, and returning thanks to the Performers for their care and uncommon excellence in the Repre&s;entation, I did not think of adding any thing further by way of Preface: but my Publi&s;her in&s;i&s;ts on the nece&s;&s;ity of my &s;aying &s;ome|thing in behalf of the Piece, which, I think, ought to &s;peak for it&s;elf, and that my friend's &s;cheme is much of the &s;ame colour with Bayes's practice of printing papers <HI>to in&s;inuate the plot into the Boxes</HI>. It has been u&s;ual with the Writers of the French Theatre, it is true, to tack Examens of their Plays, like a &s;ting or <HI>melius non tangere</HI> to the Cri|ticks, to the tail of them. But why need an Eng|li&s;h Author put him&s;elf to that trouble, when the learned and impartial gentlemen of the Reviews are &s;o ready to take it off his hands, unle&s;s it were, like Dryden, to turn the thunder of the Critick's own artillery again&s;t him&s;elf, and to confute or anticipate his cen&s;ures, by proving the Fable, Cha|racters, Sentiments, and Language, to be excel|lent, or, if indeed there were &s;ome parts of it in|ferior to the re&s;t, &s;uch parts were purpo&s;ely <HI>un|derwritten</HI>, in order to &s;et off the &s;uperior to more advantage? This, indeed, Dryden has often done, and done &s;o inimitably; that I &s;hall not attempt
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
it after him. To the Gentlemen, therefore, above|mentioned, the &s;elf-impannelled Jury of the Eng|li&s;h Court of Critici&s;m, without Challenge, I put my&s;elf on my Trial for the High Crime of wri|ting for the Stage, tru&s;ting that their candour will &s;end me a good deliverance.</P>
<P>I could, indeed, in compliance with the reque&s;t of my Publi&s;her, have obliged the Publick, by printing, entire, an original Manu&s;cript, now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, containing &s;everal &s;trictures on the following &s;cenes; being no other than a Letter from my Mother, occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t night's repre&s;entation, which, like mo&s;t other fir&s;t nights, was nothing more than a Publick Rehear&s;al, with ten thou&s;and fears and apprehen&s;ions, that never attend a private one. The Good Gentlewoman, hurt at the confu&s;ion, and in pain for my &s;ucce&s;s, tells me with much warmth, and as dogmatically as any Male Critick could po&s;&s;ibly do, that She is a&s;toni&s;hed at my attempting to violate the received laws of the Drama&mdash;That the <HI>Cata&s;trophe</HI> (that was really her word) is directly contrary to all known rules&mdash;That the &s;everal Characters, in&s;tead of being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, one by one, &s;hould have been indu&s;triou&s;ly kept together, to make a bow to the audience at the dropping of the curtain&mdash;That, notwith&s;tanding any confu&s;ion, created by the Girl's whim&s;ical pa&s;&s;ion for Novels, in the cour&s;e of the Piece, all parties &s;hould be perfectly reconciled to each other at la&s;t. Polly, having manife&s;ted her af|fection for him, &s;hould, to be &s;ure, have been mar|ried to Scribble; and the Parents &s;hould have been thoroughly, though &s;uddenly, appea&s;ed by the declared reformation of both. Ledger might, with much propriety and great probability, have been di&s;po&s;ed of to the Nur&s;e: and the whole
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
Piece, in&s;tead of concluding bluntly with a &s;en|tence in Pro&s;e, &s;hould have been tagged with a Couplet or Two; and then every thing would have gone off &s;moothly and roundly, <HI>&aacute; l&aacute; mode du Th&aacute;atre</HI>.</P>
<P>Having thus pre&s;ented the Publick with a &s;mall &s;pecimen of my good Mother's talents for Criti|ci&s;m, I &s;hall not, by attempting to an&s;wer them, heap Remarks upon Remarks; rather chu&s;ing to leave Her and all other Criticks, Male and Female, to meditate on the following extract from Ben Jon&s;on; but mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, de&s;ire not to be under&s;tood to take to my&s;elf that confidence, with which He pre&s;umes to &s;peak of his own abi|lities.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Though my Cata&s;trophe may, in the &s;trict rigour of Comick Law, meet with cen&s;ure; I de&s;ire the learned and charitable Critick, to have &s;o much faith in me, to think it was done of indu&s;try: for, with what ea&s;e I could have va|ried it nearer his &s;cale (but that I fear to boa&s;t &endq;my own faculty) I could here in&s;ert."</Q> To this quotation I &s;hall add a &s;hort &s;tory, and then con|clude my Preface with the remainder of my good Mother's Letter. The Story is as follows:</P>
<P>A Nobleman of Madrid, being pre&s;ent at the Spani&s;h Comedy, fell a&s;leep during the fir&s;t act, and never woke again till the end of the play. Then rubbing his eyes, and ob&s;erving his friends laughing at the hearty nap he had taken, be cried out, <HI>How now? Gentlemen! What! Is it</HI> OVER <HI>then? Are the Actors all</HI> MARRIED?</P>
<P>The remainder of the Letter is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>&mdash;<Q>&startq;And then I was the more alarmed at this un&s;ea&s;onable attempt at Novelty, le&s;t it &s;hould put it out of my power to pre&s;erve my
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
credit with my worthy friend, Mr. Lute&s;tring, the &s;ilk-mercer, in Cheap&s;ide. You know, Child, that ju&s;t after you had informed me of Polly Honeycombe's being in rehear&s;al, a late me|lancholy event put the whole nation into deep Mourning. The things, which I made up three years ago, on account of the death of the Prince&s;s of Orange, having &s;ince been u&s;ed on &s;everal other occa&s;ions, could by no means be rendered capable of going through the pre&s;ent Mourning: a &s;ix months mourning! quite a thing impo&s;&s;ible. This gave me &s;ome little unea|&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially as I had ju&s;t got my Blue-Tabby cleaned for the winter's wear. However, I did not doubt but that, on the &s;trength of your Farce, my good friend Lute&s;tring would give me credit for two and twenty yards of Bombazine, to make me up a &s;ack and petticoat; and accord|ingly I went immediately up to his hou&s;e. When I got there, Mr. Lute&s;tring was not at home; but the Young Man very civily de&s;ired me to walk into the little parlour behind the &s;hop, till his ma&s;ter's return, and there I found Mrs. Lute&s;tring, who received me with her u&s;ual good-nature. The Good Woman was &s;itting alone (the Two Girls being gone, it &s;eems, to &s;ee the &s;caffolding in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey) in|du&s;triou&s;ly emyloyed in making up her own Mourning; but her Daughters' Gowns, ju&s;t come from the Mantua-Maker's, lay in the window; and black caps, black fans, black gloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the milliner's, were &s;cattered carele&s;ly about the table, together with three or four books, half-bound, and a bulky pamphlet. The&s;e I had the curio&s;ity to examine, and found them to be, (though much thumbed, and in a grea&s;y con|dition,
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
indeed, for the peru&s;al of &s;uch fine la|dies) the fir&s;t volume of the Adventures of Mr. Loveil, the third volume of Bet&s;y Thought|le&s;s, the New Atalantis for the year 1760, and the Catalogue of the Circulating Library. The books I was too well acquainted with to be tempted to any further peru&s;al of them; but (on Mrs. Lute&s;tring's being called into the &s;hop to &s;peak to a particular cu&s;tomer) I made the in|clo&s;ed Extract from the Catalogue, which, as it falls exactly in with your de&s;ign, I now &s;end for your con&s;ideration. Heaven ble&s;s you, My Dear Child! and &s;end that your Farce may do &s;ome &endq;good on the Giddy Girls of this Age!</Q></P>

<P>I have not read &s;o many books for nothing. Novels, Nur&s;ee, Novels! A Novel is the only thing to teach a girl life, and the way of the world, and elegant fancies, and love to the end of the chapter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="19">
<SPEAKER>NURSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, you are always reading your &s;imple &s;tory-books. The <HI>Ventures</HI> of Jack this, and the hi&s;tory of Bet&s;y t'other, and &s;ir Humphrys, and women with hard chri&s;tian names. You had better read your prayer-book, Chicken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o I do; but I'm reading this now&mdash;<STAGE><HI>Look|ing into the book.</HI></STAGE> "She raved, but the baronet"&mdash;I really think I love Mr. Scribble as well as Emilia did &s;ir George.&mdash;Do you think, Nur&s;ee, I &s;hould have had &s;uch a good notion of love &s;o early, if I had not read Novels?&mdash;Did not I make a conque&s;t of Mr. Scribble in a &s;ingle night at a dancing? But my cro&s;s Papa will hardly ever let me go out. &mdash;And then, I know life as well as if I had been in the Beau Monde all my days. I can tell the nature of a ma&s;querade as well as if I had been at twenty. I long for a mobbing &s;cheme with Mr. Scribble to the two-&s;hilling gallery, or a &s;nug party a little way out of town, in a po&s;t-chai&s;e&mdash; and then, I have &s;uch a head full of intrigues and contrivances! Oh, Nur&s;ee, a Novel is the only thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NURSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Contrivances! ay, marry, you have need of contrivances. Here are your Papa and Mama fully re&s;olved to marry you to young Mr. Ledger, Mr. Simeon the rich Jew's wife's nephew, and all the while your head runs upon nothing but Mr. Scribble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fiddle-&s;tick's end for Mr. Ledger! I tell you what, Nur&s;ee. I'll marry Mr. Scribble, and not marry
<PB N="6" REF="20">
Mr. Ledger, whether Papa and Mama chu&s;e it or no.&mdash;And how do you think I'll contrive it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, by my troth, not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O lord, it's the commone&s;t thing in the world. &mdash;I intend to elope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NURSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Elope! Chicken, what's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in the vulgar phra&s;e, run away,&mdash; that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>NURSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on us!&mdash;Run away!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>POLLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, run away, to be &s;ure. Why there's no|thing in that, you know. Every girl elopes, when her parents are ob&s;tinate and ill-natur'd about mar|rying her. It was ju&s;t &s;o with Bet&s;y Thomp&s;on, and Sally Wilkins, and Clarinda, and Leonora in the hi&s;tory of Dick Carele&s;s, and Julia in the Ad|ventures of Tom Ramble, and fifty others&mdash;Did not they all elope? and &s;o will I too. I have as much right to elope, as they had, for I have as much love and as much &s;pirit as the be&s;t of them.</P>

<P>What care I for Papa and Mama?

<LG>
<L>MY poor Papa's in woeful agitation&mdash;</L>
<L>While I, the Cau&s;e, feel here, <STAGE><HI>&s;triking her bo&s;om.</HI></STAGE> no palpitation&mdash;</L>
<L>We Girls of Reading, and &s;uperior notions,</L>
<L>Who from the fountain-head drink love's &s;weet potions,</L>
<L>Pity our parents, when &s;uch pa&s;&s;ion blinds 'em,</L>
<L>One hears the good folks rave&mdash;One never minds 'em.</L>
<L>Till the&s;e dear books infus'd their &s;oft ingredients,</L>
<L>A&s;ham'd and fearful, I was all Obedience.</L>
<L>Then my good Father did not &s;torm in vain,</L>
<L>I blu&s;h'd and cry'd&mdash;<HI>I'll ne'er do &s;o again:</HI></L>

<L>So much the&s;e Dear In&s;tructors change and win us,</L>

<L>Here we at once &s;upply our childi&s;h wants&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>NOVELS</HI> are Hotbeds for your forward Plants.</L>
<L>Not only Sentiments refine the Soul,</L>

<L>Each awkward circum&s;tance for laughter &s;erves,</L>
<L>From Nur&s;e's non&s;en&s;e to my Mother's <HI>NERVES</HI>:</L>
<L>Tho' Parents tells us, that our genius lies</L>
<L>In mending linnen and in making pies,</L>
<L><PB REF="60">I &s;et &s;uch formal precepts at defiance</L>
<L>That preach up prudence, neatne&s;s, and compliance:</L>

<L>To be a Wit, Philo&s;opher, and Slattern&mdash;</L>
