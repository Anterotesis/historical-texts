<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS very natural for Per&s;ons who attempt
things of this Nature, to lay hold on the
&s;malle&s;t Occa&s;ion to claim the Protection of the
Generous and Ju&s;t. I have heard you commend
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Stories, and having ventur'd upon one, pre|&s;ume
to offer it at your Feet. It is almost im|po&s;&s;ible
for a Man of your Goodne&s;s and Chara|cter,
to e&s;cape Addre&s;&s;es of this kind; for as the
Sower and Moro&s;e de&s;pi&s;e the Mu&s;e, &s;o &s;he always
flies them, a Clime too rough and tempe&s;tuous for
her tender Pinions; but with Plea&s;ure a&s;pires to
the Brave: And who more truly de&s;erves that Epi|thet,
than Sr. <HI>Jacob Banks?</HI></P>
<P>One, who tho' not born a Native of <HI>England,</HI>
yet, by his Zeal for the Glory of the Be&s;t of
Queens, and con&s;tant A&s;&s;ertion for the Nation's
Cau&s;e has Ju&s;tly made this Country his own,
un&s;haken to his Friend, and delighting to do
kind Offices to all. I am entred upon a Theme
which did I follow my Inclinations, I &s;hould
not ea&s;ily quit; but &s;ometimes even Truth of|fends
<PB REF="3">
in &s;o nice a Point as Prai&s;e; and Per&s;ons of
Merit with le&s;s Pain <HI>Do</HI> great Actions, than hear
of them. That you may &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s all Happi|ne&s;s,
and long enjoy tho&s;e Pledges of your Love
left you by a Beauteous Wife, for who&s;e Memory
you retain &s;uch a Veneration and Tenderne&s;s,
&s;carce to be met with in your Sex; that the&s;e,
and all other Ble&s;&s;ings may continually attend you,
is the daily Wi&s;h of,</P>

Equipt I &s;ee <HI>a la Mode D'E&s;pagne.</HI> What can&s;t thou
mean by this&mdash;S'death I'd a&s;&s;oon change the
Habit of thy Sex and wear the Womens Furbe|lows
as the&s;e Dam'd Golilia's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Behold what a pair of Spectacles my Rogue of a Tay|$or
has brought me, $word$ Sight of which I $word$ a great Pa&s;&s;ion
bid him look in my Face and gue&s;s $span$ tho&s;e Helps.
<HI>Don Thimble</HI> with the Gravity of a Corrigidore an&s;wer'd,
'twas a Proof of Manhood not of Age&punc; and by the &s;olemn
Oath of St. <HI>Sago,</HI> Swor$ not a Hero of fourteen dur&s;t pre|tend
to a piece of Gallantry without the&s;e Magnifying Gla&s;&s;es,

ye under&s;tand me Friend.</P>
</SP>

<P>Rediculous&mdash;pr'ythee give them me; I'll carry
them for a Pre&s;ent to an Old Decay'd Beauty of my Acquain|quaintance

in his Train as Relations and Men that de&s;ign only to &s;ee the

Plea&s;ure? Why we &s;hould put our &s;elves in pain with the
Formality of their incomprehen&s;ible Dre&s;s? Is indeed to me
unacountable Folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Gay-love,</HI> you mi&s;take my End&mdash;'tis to promote
my Plea&s;ure I have done it. I never yet Addre&s;s'd a Woman

watch him clo&s;e, u&s;e your Pi&s;tol if he proceeds&mdash;&s;o

Behaviour, and try what Luck I &s;hall meet with then.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gay.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on and Pro&s;per&mdash;for my part I have no rea|&s;on
to Complain of my Stars as I am&mdash;Not long ago I
pa&s;s'd the Night in the Arms of a melting Beauty, tho' her
Father lay Coughing over Head, and her &s;noring Brother in
the next Room.</P>

<P>Have a care <HI>Gay-love,</HI> &s;ome of the&s;e Women will be|betray

<P>To confe&s;s the Truth I have&mdash;there is a Woman

may read without my Spectacles, who like a cruel Cerberu$
as he is, forbids all that approach, only by &s;tol'n Glances from
her talking Eyes I fancy my &s;elf not di&s;agreeable to her,
this is the occa&s;ion of my Habit, and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on

we$'t thou Malicious, can do her nor me no harm in it, I dare
