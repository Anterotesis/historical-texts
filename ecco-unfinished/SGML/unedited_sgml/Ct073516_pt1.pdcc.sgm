<P>THE Baron d'Urbin had attained that age, when, it is to be pre|&s;umed, the &s;tormy pa&s;&s;ions are hu&s;hed into a calm, or to &s;peak le&s;s poetically, he had more than compleated his &s;eventieth year; yet, accu&s;tomed from his earlie&s;t youth to every fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;ipation, his reflections on the various &s;cenes of luxu|rious plea&s;ure, in which he had &s;o fre|quently
<PB N="14" REF="5">been engaged, awakened &s;uch plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations and &s;o warmed his ima|gination by recollection, that the&s;e lively ideas &s;triking on the flint of his memory, and from thence dropping on a heart little better than tinder, brought a kind of fire in his eyes which might &s;erve to remind the beholders of tho&s;e mountains we read of, emitting flames from their &s;ummits, though every other part of them is incru&s;ted with &s;now and ice. The Baron, however, though certainly old, did not in the lea&s;t re&s;emble the generality of men at his age. He was naturally good-tempered, lively, gay, entertaining and ever well received in the be&s;t and polite&s;t circles of Paris&mdash;he enjoyed a perfect &s;tate of health, except now and then an unwelcome vi&s;it from the gout made him call in the aid of his ivo|ry-headed crutch and quilted &s;attin
<PB N="15" REF="6">&s;hoe, but otherwi&s;e walked like a man of thirty; held him&s;elf as upright as po&s;&s;i|ble, and &s;poke in a loud voice to prove his lungs unimpaired&mdash;he was likewi&s;e peculiarly happy in a valet-de-chambre, who, by his judicious and elegant man|ner of dre&s;&s;ing a large profu&s;ion of fair curls to re&s;emble a fine head of hair, hid many of his wrinkles, took off &s;everal years from his appearance, and perfectly ingratiated him&s;elf into his ma&s;ter's e&s;teem and affection. The Baron generally pa&s;&s;ed the morning at his toilette; and being dre&s;&s;ed by noon, in the mo&s;t perfect etiquette of the fa&s;hion, he proceed|ed in his glittering vis-a-vis to pay a circle of vi&s;its to &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed beauties; and his evenings were chiefly devoted to places of public diver&s;ion, where, both at the play and opera, he ogled, nodded and &s;miled on
<PB N="16" REF="7">the actre&s;&s;es without mercy. The women of fa&s;hion in general received his adorations with good humour, diverted them&s;elves with his &s;uperannuated com|pliments, and thought it an additional proof of their charms to &s;ubdue a lover who had been the delight and ceci&s;beo of their great-grandmothers; whil&s;t the Ba|ron imagined his antiquated affection could not fail of in&s;piring the mo&s;t flat|tering return of tenderne&s;s and love; and when they &s;miled at his extravagant rap|tures, he fancied they approved his pa&s;&s;i|on&mdash;whil&s;t, &s;uch was his vanity, that he was not in the lea&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed at his good fortune; but con&s;idered it as the mere irre&s;i&s;table effects and impre&s;&s;ion of his all-conquering per&s;on and charms.</P>

<P>THE Barone&s;s D'Urbin, who had journeyed through almo&s;t as many winters as the Baron, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame propen&s;ity for gaiety and plea&s;ure with him&s;elf; and being equally vain, and de|&s;irous of appearing young and hand&s;ome, every art which could either adorn her per&s;on, or make her appear more amia|ble and lovely, was con&s;tantly exerted. A tete <HI>built</HI> by the mo&s;t celebrated hair-architect in all Paris, formed in curls and ringlets of Cupids and bleeding hearts, with a great quantity of rouge, and &s;ome well directed patches, gave her, according to her idea, the bloom and graces of fifteen; whil&s;t a pair of tight &s;tays, made by the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable work|man, drew her flat figure into a proper
<PB N="18" REF="9">roundne&s;s at the top, and &s;mallne&s;s at the bottom; a true garri&s;on hoop hid the pointed projection of her bony hips, and &s;hewed the thin ancle to advantage: thus adorned and armed for conque&s;t, &s;he practi&s;ed a thou&s;and ridiculous airs, and in humble imitation of the god of love, her arrows, like his, were equally direct|ed to the young and old, plain and hand|&s;ome. Every fancied conque&s;t equally gratified her vanity, and love of univer|&s;al power; &s;he &s;miled on one, affected an air of coldne&s;s and di&s;dain to another; laughed and whi&s;pered with a third, whil&s;t negligently reclined on an elegant &s;opha with a fourth, &s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf with her guitar or knotting, to di&s;play the &s;nowy whitene&s;s of her hands and arms; and thus employed &s;he would cir|culate the &s;candal of the day, in an half|li&s;p kind of whi&s;pering tone; every now
<PB N="19" REF="10">and then biting and pinching her lips to give them a more inviting redne&s;s. At length perceiving her conque&s;ts not quite &s;o exten&s;ive, or her &s;laves &s;o faithful as her vanity expected, &s;he began to con&s;i|der what could po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion &s;uch a falling off in her powers of attraction; but at length turning about, and &s;eeing at &s;ome little di&s;tance her beautiful daugh|ter of &s;eventeen, in a circle of pretty fel|lows, with a form and height, which, whil&s;t it convicted her of her declining age, convinced her al&s;o, that her artificial charms had now the misfortune of being cruelly eclip&s;ed by this bloom of elegance, youth, and beauty; and thus chagrined at &s;o dreadful a truth, (which, however, &s;he would not for the world have acknow|ledged) &s;he began for the fir&s;t time to &s;ee the e&s;&s;ential difference between her&s;elf

<HEAD>FOLLY III.</HEAD>
<P>IN imminent danger of being thus wholly neglected, the enraged Baron|e&s;s at length re&s;olved on an expedient well known to mo&s;t Pari&s;ian mothers, who&s;e daughters are either grown tall enough, or hand&s;ome enough to claim a &s;hare in their conque&s;ts: &s;he in&s;tantly therefore determined on a convent, in order to &s;eque&s;ter tho&s;e powerful charms which now began to cau&s;e her &s;o much di&s;quietude; this re&s;olve, however, re|quired &s;ome pau&s;e, and days con&s;idera|tion, to carry into proper execution; not that &s;he her&s;elf ever meant to become her frequent vi&s;itor, but wi&s;hed this con|vent to be one of the fir&s;t in reputation, that the world might approve her con|duct in the &s;teps &s;he was taking, when
<PB N="22" REF="15">they came to know Mademoi&s;elle D'Urbin was placed there; and &s;o great was her care and delicacy in this point, that it being one of tho&s;e where young women of quality had been u&s;ually educated, and one celebrated for the piety and learning of its inhabitants, was not a &s;ufficient re|commendation; &s;he rather wi&s;hed it one of tho&s;e, where &s;ome Prince&s;s re&s;ided at that time, or at lea&s;t one of tho&s;e, that had been an a&s;ylum for blood-royal. Nor was it long before the Barone&s;s had the &s;upreme happine&s;s of hearing of one &s;ui|table to her pre&s;ent wi&s;hes; and no &s;ooner had &s;he made the important di&s;covery, than &s;he in&s;tantly conducted her daughter to this brilliant pri&s;on; and returned home, with the mo&s;t perfect &s;atisfaction at having thus at once relieved her&s;elf from &s;o very trouble&s;ome a companion and rival.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Baron expre&s;&s;ed little or no concern at the Barone&s;s's return from the convent without Mademoi&s;elle D'Urbin; having long re&s;igned the reins and entire management of all dome&s;tic concerns, his own attention (as he thought) being more agreeably taken up and amu|&s;ed, than in the dull mechanic ob&s;ervance of the conduct of either his wife or daugh|ter; and indeed the time of a man of gallantry, is too precious to be devoted to women &s;o nearly related to him; he was likewi&s;e at this juncture, for the hundred and fifty-&s;ixth time, mo&s;t violently in love; and &s;o great was his pa&s;&s;ion, that it entirely changed his natural di&s;po&s;i|tion. The agitation of his mind was im|printed on his very countenance; he be|came
<PB N="24" REF="17">grave and thoughtful; &s;ighed mo&s;t profoundly; lo&s;t both &s;leep and appetite; and was never happy but when in com|pany with the beloved object of his amo|rous pa&s;&s;ion. The nymph who had now made a conque&s;t &s;o flattering to her va|nity, was a beauty of eighteen, a perfect Euphro&s;yne, who lived only to laugh, dance, and &s;ing; and &s;o ungovernable was her mirth, that it frequently di&s;played it&s;elf on the mo&s;t &s;erious &s;ubjects: what then mu&s;t be its effects on one &s;o ridicu|lous as her old lover, who con&s;tantly en|gaged in all her whims and caprices, with the mo&s;t eager and docile compli|ance? Sometimes &s;he would oblige him to run races with her, 'till he was nearly ex|piring for want of breath; at other times &s;he would make him dance, 'till in a mo&s;t unbecoming per&s;piration; now and then, as if intending to confer a favour, &s;he
<PB N="25" REF="18">would entangle her fingers in his hair, derange his fal&s;e curls, beat out the marechale powder with her fan, and keep him in agonies le&s;t his own few grey locks &s;hould be di&s;covered; and whil&s;t thus &s;uffering little le&s;s than the torture, he was obliged to ki&s;s the fingers which acted &s;o maliciou&s;ly; and often when he threw him&s;elf on his knees to implore her conce&s;&s;ion, &s;he would &s;uddenly ring her bell, that her &s;ervants might &s;ur|prize her gallant in &s;o comic a &s;ituation, &s;o unbecoming his years, and which mu&s;t appear to them &s;o truly ridiculous.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY V.</HEAD>
<P>MADAME D'Urbin, in the mid&s;t of her affectation, was &s;truck with the figure of an amiable Chevalier of twenty-two; from daily admiration &s;he became partial, and at length carried her ideas &s;o far as to &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf actually in love; in con&s;equence of which &s;he redoubled her coquetti&s;h airs and antiquated graces, and became, if po&s;&s;ible, more ridiculous than before: the object of her affection was, however, far from believing him&s;elf to be the cau&s;e of the&s;e repeated oglings, and was, in reality, the approved lover of the laughing lady, at who&s;e feet we left the Baron; they had obtained the con&s;ent of their friends on both &s;ides, and waited with impatience the day fixed for
<PB N="27" REF="20">their happy union. The Barone&s;s, in the mean time, a&s;toni&s;hed that her &s;ighs and langui&s;hing looks made not any impre&s;|&s;ion on the Chevalier, imputed, with the mo&s;t perfect &s;atisfaction, his inattention to a want of knowledge of the world, and a diffidence which would not permit him to a&s;pire to a per&s;on of her rank and quality; &s;he therefore re&s;olved generou&s;ly to declare her pa&s;&s;ion; and took an opportunity of &s;lipping into his pocket, unob&s;erved, a billet couched in the following tender words: <Q>Ungrateful man, do not my &startq;frequent &s;ighs and downca&s;t eyes &s;uf|ficiently betray the &s;ecret of that heart which owns you for its con|queror? Is it mode&s;ty, or indifference, which renders you thus blind to tho&s;e &s;entiments you have in&s;pired? I am anxious to know from what cau&s;e it can proceed; be therefore in the
<PB N="28" REF="21">King's garden at &s;even to-morrow evening, where I will endeavour to convince you that your felicity de|pends on your&s;elf, and is greater than you can entertain any idea of at pre|&s;ent.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The Chevalier knew not what to con|jecture from the contents of this note; he was equally a&s;toni&s;hed at the declara|tion of love, and the manner of its being conveyed into his pocket from a prin|ciple of con&s;tancy &s;carcely to be credited; his fir&s;t emotion tempted him to &s;acri|fice it to his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, but like a true man of fa&s;hion he &s;oon hu&s;hed this liberal idea a&s;leep, and in&s;tantly formed in his mind &s;o fair a picture of the beauty and tenderne&s;s of the writer, that he hurried before the appointed hour to the place of a&s;&s;ignation, with the utmo&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="22">&s;elf-complacency and &s;atisfaction. After taking &s;everal turns in different walks, with impatient eyes and ha&s;ty &s;teps, he at length beheld the old Barone&s;s ap|proach; but fearful, le&s;t her pre&s;ence would prevent his enamoured charmer and corre&s;pondent from making her ap|pearance, he endeavoured to avoid the Barone&s;s; but every method was in vain; re&s;olved to join him, &s;he acco&s;ted him with an affected confu&s;ion, whil&s;t the Chevalier, who&s;e bo&s;om beat high with expectation and &s;en&s;ations very different from tho&s;e &s;he could in&s;pire, payed not the lea&s;t attention to her &s;eeming embarra&s;&s;|ment;&mdash;an&s;wered all her que&s;tions with mono&s;yllables only; and unable to con|quer or conceal his di&s;quietude at being thus interrupted &s;o <HI>mal &agrave; propos,</HI> was going to leave her abruptly, when the enraptured Barone&s;s caught hold of his
<PB N="30" REF="23">hand&mdash;<Q>I know (&s;aid &s;he) my dear &startq;Chevalier, what motive brings you hi|ther; it is to meet the mo&s;t tender and faithful of her &s;ex, who comes determined to lay a&s;ide her rank and dignity, and gratify your pa&s;&s;ion; and you behold in me the woman on whom your merit has made &s;o deep an &endq;impre&s;&s;ion.</Q> A&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;mortified, and confu&s;ed at this unexpected decla|ration, the Chevalier retired with preci|pitation, and without power to make her any reply; but could not re&s;train from the loude&s;t bur&s;t of laughter, which the Barone&s;s heard with rage and indigna|tion; yet returned home as perfectly &s;a|tisfied with her own charms, as &s;he was before &s;he made &s;o mortifying an experi|ment.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="31" REF="24">
<HEAD>FOLLY VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE expected a&s;&s;ignation having thus ended in a manner &s;o little conformable to the wi&s;hes of the Che|valier, he determined to make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and went in&s;tantly to ac|quaint his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s with his di&s;co|very: her &s;entiments not being &s;uffici|ently refined to be hurt by only an in|tended infidelity, &s;he rallied him on his conque&s;t, and joined in laughing at the re&s;emblance of their de&s;tiny, which had favoured them with &s;uch antiquated admi|rers; after many mutual <HI>bon-mots,</HI> &s;mart repartees, and &s;allies of plea&s;antry on the occa&s;ion, the fair one following the natural liveline&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, pro|po&s;ed a &s;cheme which the Chevalier, equally malicious, in&s;tantly acquie&s;ced
<PB N="32" REF="25">in, and &s;oon after parted &s;eemingly on as good terms as ever; but how much were all their acquaintance a&s;toni&s;hed, when in a few days the lady became not only thoughtful and re&s;erved with her lover, but was &s;een &s;tealing glances at the Baron, and often permitted him (with the blu&s;h and downca&s;t look of mode&s;|ty) to ki&s;s her hands, with now and then an opportunity thrown carele&s;sly in his way to urge the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had formerly made a je&s;t of? But what heightened this &s;ituation &s;till, and makes it more laughable, is, the Chevalier became at|tached to the Barone&s;s, and &s;eemed charmed with her &s;ociety; and this he carried &s;o far, that when he could not contrive to play at the &s;ame table, he would place him&s;elf the whole evening behind her chair, conver&s;e with her in whi&s;pers, frequent only the families
<PB N="33" REF="26">where &s;he vi&s;ited; and in &s;hort, became &s;o much her faithful and devoted ceci&s;beo, that he at la&s;t prevailed on her to once more give him a private interview at the hou&s;e of a Lady whom they both vi&s;ited. One day, when the old Baron came as u&s;ual to pay his court to the idol of his heart, &s;he ran to meet him in the anti-chamber, <Q>Contrive (&s;aid &s;he, in a whi&s;|pering &startq;accent) to &s;teal unperceived at this hour to-morrow to my cham|ber, I have &s;omething of con&s;equence &endq;to impart to you.</Q> The tran&s;ported Baron was unable to an&s;wer, his whole frame &s;hook as if electrified, his voice faltered, and he could only expre&s;s his ec&s;tacy by &s;queezing the fair hand he held in his: the wi&s;hed for to-morrow at length arrived, and the impatient Ba|ron appeared at the hou&s;e of the charmer; two or three rooms being filled with
<PB N="34" REF="27">company, &s;oon gave him the wi&s;hed for opportunity to go unnoticed to the cham|ber, which he entered on tip toe, and with the utmo&s;t precaution and gentle|ne&s;s, &s;hut the door; the &s;hutters were half clo&s;ed, the curtains entirely drawn down, and a kind of glimmering light &s;eemed to in&s;pire temerity in the lover, and &s;pare the blu&s;hes of the lady. The ob&s;curity redoubled the hopes of the Baron, who, on perceiving his mi&s;tre&s;s reclined on a &s;opha, approached; and, in defiance of gout, rheumati&s;m, and tre|mulous old age, threw him&s;elf on his knees before her. She &s;ighed mo&s;t pro|foundly, yet intimidated (as he &s;uppo&s;ed) by the novelty of her &s;ituation with &s;o enterpri&s;ing a lover, &s;he continued &s;ilent, whil&s;t he in raptures at her conde&s;cen|&s;ion, took her hand and be&s;towed on it the mo&s;t lively care&s;&s;es; at length, re|clining
<PB N="35" REF="28">her head upon his &s;houlder, <Q>Ah! &startq;&endq;(&s;aid &s;he, in a low voice) beloved Che|valier, I adore you.</Q> The Baron, a&s;to|ni&s;hed and &s;urprized, was almo&s;t anni|hilated at this appellation; but recollect|ing him&s;elf, was fearful her agitation of mind had &s;omewhat di&s;ordered her in|tellects. To &s;ooth her terror, he fond|ly took her in his arms, and was going to repeat his vows of everla&s;ting love and fidelity, when the door flew open with a violent noi&s;e, a crowd of company ru&s;hed in, the &s;hutters were opened, the curtains drawn up by an in|vi&s;ible hand, and di&s;covered to the Baron, fondly encircled in his arms, his antiqua|ted wife in an elegant di&s;habille, adorned with a profu&s;ion of ro&s;e coloured ribbon. Never did the head of Medu&s;a produce a more in&s;tantaneous petrefaction, or form two more expre&s;&s;ive &s;tatues of &s;ur|pri&s;e, than tho&s;e of the hu&s;band and
<PB N="36" REF="29">wife, who found them&s;elves &s;o near when they believed them&s;elves &s;o very di&s;tant from each other. <Q>Behold, &startq;Ladies and Gentlemen, (&s;aid a wit of the company) a rare though im|prudent example of conjugal tender|ne&s;s in a couple, who, though for many years united in the clo&s;e&s;t of all ties, yet &s;till continue to love with &s;uch pa&s;&s;ion as to retire even at the hou&s;e of a friend, renounce the charms of an elegant a&s;&s;embly, and find not any plea&s;ure but in &s;olitude, and the &endq;&s;ociety of each other.</Q> The laugh was univer&s;al, except on the part of the unfortunate pair, at who&s;e expence it was rai&s;ed; and they retired in confu&s;ion amid&s;t the jibes and je&s;ts of their ac|quaintance, who&s;e follies, were they equally held up, might perhaps be as laughable as tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent objects of their mirth and ridicule.</P>

<P>LET us now return to the convent, and &s;ee in what manner Mademoi|&s;elle D'Urbin pa&s;&s;ed her time, in a &s;itua|tion &s;o entirely new to her, and the no|velty by no means a plea&s;ing one, as there cannot po&s;&s;ibly be a greater misfor|tune to a young female, ju&s;t flattered into beauty, than to have none but her own &s;ex the in&s;ipid witne&s;&s;es to the improve|ment of her charms; and the brighte&s;t eyes have not the lea&s;t influence over black veils and white forehead cloths. Mademoi&s;elle D'Urbin had the &s;evere mortification of proving the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion; and her u&s;ual &s;pirits became &s;o depre&s;&s;ed by this total &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, that &s;he lo&s;t all chearfulne&s;s, health, and appetite, for &s;everal weeks;
<PB N="38" REF="31">but at length a de&s;ire of amu&s;ement and the love for mi&s;chief getting the better of her dejection, &s;he formed a charitable de&s;ign of diverting her&s;elf by tormenting the nuns, and in&s;tantly practi&s;ed every device, art and imagination could &s;ug|ge&s;t; and being &s;ecure of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of every boarder in the convent in this laudable undertaking, &s;he committed perpetual thefts and depredations in the fruit garden, till at la&s;t her frequent plunders had reduced them to de&s;pair; the garden to a de&s;art; and the holy di|rectors of their con&s;cience went &s;ighing home without any pro&s;pect of their de&s;ert for their &s;ummer, or &s;weetmeats for their winter collation.

<P>HAVING thus di&s;po&s;ed of Ma|demoi&s;elle D'Urbin, the old Ba|rone&s;s began to pa&s;s her time more plea|&s;antly, and thought her&s;elf &s;o much more attended to by the men than when her rival daughter was pre&s;ent, that &s;he &s;incerely regretted her re&s;idence at the convent could be only temporary; and that her fortune was too large for the Ba|ron to con&s;ent to her ever taking the veil: as it was therefore impo&s;&s;ible to hope &s;he &s;hould ever &s;eclude Mademoi&s;elle D'Ur|bin entirely from the world, &s;he deter|mined to marry her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to avoid the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of her again becoming her companion at her re|turn. A change of name would, &s;he flattered her&s;elf, render their relation&s;hip
<PB N="42" REF="37">le&s;s con&s;picuous, as it was to be pre&s;um|ed (being both well-bred women) they might then meet in the &s;ame parties without ever being &s;u&s;pected to be mo|ther and daughter. Full of this idea, &s;he began to look round on the young men of fa&s;hion for a proper hu&s;band for Mademoi&s;elle D'Urbin; and hearing from a friend that the Marquis D'Illois in|tended to marry, &s;he contrived the very next day to have propo&s;als made to him for her daughter. The Marquis having been long the favourite of all tho&s;e fa&s;hionable women who&s;e good graces are the pride of fools, and de&s;pi&s;ed by men of &s;en&s;e, fancied him&s;elf wearied in the labyrinth of folly, and was re&s;olved to exchange the flowery bands of love for the ada|mantine fetters of Hymen: he was not a &s;tranger to the fortune and connections of the Baron, and received the&s;e advan|ces

On the meeting of the Mar|quis and the Baron, every thing &s;eemed to concur to favour her wi&s;hes; the rent roll of the Marquis an&s;wered every paren|tal expectation, and the demanded &s;et|tlement was mo&s;t readily agreed to on his part; in &s;hort, this important affair was nearly brought to a conclu&s;ion be|fore they ever recollected that one e&s;|&s;ential point had been neglected, and that the future hu&s;band and wife had as yet never &s;een each other:

<P>THE Marquis might well be a&s;to|ni&s;hed when he heard the Barone&s;s give this rea&s;on for declining a match fir&s;t propo&s;ed at her own reque&s;t; but Mon&s;ieur D'Illois, being tolerably con|ver&s;ant in the caprices of fine ladies, and judging the Barone&s;s might be of a di&s;po&s;ition variable as his own, he con|cluded &s;o ab&s;urd an objection would not be a la&s;ting one, and therefore redoubled his a&s;&s;iduity and attention to the old lady, in hopes of regaining her favour. The Barone&s;s, who &s;aw him chearful under this delay, imputed it to an indifference to matrimony, or an attachment el&s;ewhere, and though &s;he would not have been di&s;|plea&s;ed on being certain it was the fir&s;t, yet &s;he was fired with jealou&s;y on the

<PB N="71" REF="66">an in&s;eparable barrier to his alliance with the daughter; he therefore muttered a few incoherent words, and abruptly re|tired in confu&s;ion, and left the Barone&s;s in &s;uch a rage that &s;he could have killed him; tears at length came to her relief, and the return of her rea&s;on made her &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of concealing both her re|&s;entment and the cau&s;e of it from the world.</P>

<P>THE di&s;order of the Barone&s;s made &s;o rapid a progre&s;s, that on the fifth day there were no longer any hopes of her life; and &s;he &s;oon after was &s;eized with a delirium, during which &s;he called repeatedly on the name of the Marquis, &s;ometimes earne&s;tly reque&s;ting to &s;ee him, and a few minutes after de&s;iring her attend|ants to keep him from her &s;ight.

Mon&s;ieur D'Urbin received him with great politene&s;s, and even ap|peared extremely plea&s;ed that Mademoi|&s;elle D'Urbin was &s;till the object of his wi&s;hes; he promi&s;ed him their union &s;hould take place as &s;oon as decency would permit the celebration of their nuptials; but the apparent &s;incerity of
<PB N="88" REF="83">the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions (which by no means were intended to be &s;peedily performed) was only meant to &s;ilence the pre&s;ent importuni|ty of the Marquis; for every moment of the Baron's time was at this period devoted to a beautiful widow, who engro&s;&s;ed his time &s;o entirely, that he had neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to attend to the de|&s;ire the Marquis &s;hewed to be introduced to his daughter; and Mon&s;ieur D'Illois, finding he was obliged to conform to this delay made under pretence of re|&s;pect to form and ceremony, was deter|mined once more to wait with patience the re&s;ult of the Baron's caprice.</P>

<P>EQUALLY charmed with each other, the terms of the Marquis were quickly agreed to, and he had the &s;atisfaction to find that this change of lovers was not only perfectly agreeable to the fair Flora, but received from her the mo&s;t &s;acred a&s;&s;urances that &s;he had long wi&s;hed that &s;uch an event might take place, as he had, from the very fir&s;t moment &s;he &s;aw him, in&s;pired her with &s;en&s;ations &s;he had never before experienced for any man.

The&s;e condi|tions were chearfully a&s;&s;ented to by the Marquis; and the lady's genero&s;ity and confidence in his honour was &s;uch, that &s;he gave credit to his promi&s;e of paying the money the next morning, and per|mitted him to pa&s;s the night in her apartment.</P>

<P>THE Marquis did not return home 'till noon, and then made a point of in&s;tantly di&s;charging the debt he had contracted; he therefore gave two hun|dred louis to the valet, whom he honoured with his confidence, and ordered him to carry them directly to Madame de T***. The per&s;on entru&s;ted with this commi&s;&s;ion, was a tall, well-made young man of twenty-three, with all the ruddy graces of youth, and by no means a novice in gallantry; he had often &s;een this cele|brated toa&s;t, and found her &s;o much to his ta&s;te, that he had frequently envied tho&s;e who could afford to purcha&s;e her good graces; but as there was not the lea&s;t probability that he &s;hould ever be rich enough to obtain the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare
<PB N="113" REF="108">of her favour, he had hitherto very wi&s;ely kept his wi&s;hes a &s;ecret: opportunity now, however, &s;eemed to &s;mile upon him, and he re&s;olved to execute a very bold de&s;ign; he dre&s;&s;ed his hair in the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable and becoming &s;tile, put on one of the Marquis's mo&s;t elegant &s;uits, and with the airs of a man of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, went in a chair to the hou&s;e of the charmer, and was announced as a &s;tranger of quality, who had a &s;ecret of importance to communicate to Ma|dame De T***; the lady was too well u&s;ed to &s;uch kind of confidential friends, not to readily gue&s;s what he wi&s;hed to im|part, and granted his Lord&s;hip an immedi|ate audience; and the Valet de Chambre was introduced, who being really hand&s;ome, played the enraptured nobleman with &s;o much art, offered the two hundred louis
<PB N="114" REF="109">with &s;o much grace, and &s;o very <HI>&agrave;pr&ograve;pos,</HI> that few &s;uch ladies could have re&s;i&s;ted the temptation.

<P>WHILST thus the Valet was at once enjoying the triumph of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his mi&s;tre&s;s, and deceiving his ma&s;ter, Flora was calculating that the two hundred louis &s;he had thus un|expectedly obtained, would make four when added to tho&s;e the Marquis had promi&s;ed to &s;end her in a few hours: the&s;e were their different ideas, when her maid ran ha&s;tily into the room, and told her that Mon&s;ieur D'Illois was coming up the &s;tairs. Never was any woman more embarra&s;&s;ed than the faithful Flora: how was it po&s;&s;ible &s;he could conduct her&s;elf with propriety in &s;o critical a &s;ituation, between the two lovers? The &s;tranger, from his magnificent pre&s;ent, was cer|tainly
<PB N="116" REF="111">intitled to be treated with re&s;pect; and from the brilliant promi&s;es of the Marquis, &s;he had every thing to hope; and if either convicted her of infidelity, &s;he might lo&s;e both; &s;he therefore ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to his Lord&s;hip, and re|que&s;ted, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t intreaties, he would deign to hide him&s;elf under the bed, le&s;t he &s;hould be perceived by a jealous coxcomb, who tormented her with his care&s;&s;es, but who had long been the object of her di&s;like, though &s;he was for particular rea&s;ons obliged to di&s;gui&s;e her hatred. The poor Valet, who wi&s;hed to be hid from his ma&s;ter as much as &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h to conceal him, crept ha&s;tily under the bed, extremely glad that &s;he had given him &s;o fair an oppor|tunity to e&s;cape the fury of the Marquis; and Flora, relieved from her fears, met
<PB N="117" REF="112">Mon&s;ieur D'Illois with the utmo&s;t gaiety, embraced him with every demon&s;tra|tion of the mo&s;t ardent affection; and the happy Marquis had not the lea&s;t doubt but his perfections had in&s;pired the bo&s;om of this celebrated beauty with real and di&s;intere&s;ted love.</P>

The heart of Mademoi&s;elle D'Urbin fluttered with joy at the &s;ight of this cavalcade; &s;he embraced her father with rapture, bid adieu to her friends in the convent with an air of triumphant indifference, and on &s;tepping into the carriage, &s;eemed to ru&s;h with tran&s;port into a world to which &s;he was a perfect &s;tranger.</P>

<PB N="200" REF="195">there were not any jewellers nearer than Paris, it was a difficulty not to be obvi|ated that day. Mademoi&s;elle D'Urbin trembled le&s;t &s;he &s;hould once more be obliged to return to the convent; &s;he therefore declared, <Q>that the no&s;egay &startq;was cho&s;en by her&s;elf; that it was the jeweller had a&s;&s;ured her that it was the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable &s;ize, and that it was with difficulty &s;he could prevail on the Marquis to let her have one &s;o &s;mall; &s;he therefore conjured her aunt to per|mit &endq;her to wear it.</Q> On hearing this declaration the Counte&s;s conde&s;cended to be appea&s;ed, &s;o far as to &s;uffer the nup|tials to go on, but declared loudly again&s;t the ab&s;urdity of the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion, and was not in a perfect harmony and good humour the whole day after.</P>

<P>THE terrible word, <HI>I will,</HI> was at length pronounced by Mademoi|&s;elle D'Urbin, by which &s;he renounced the authority of a parent for that of a &s;tranger; lo&s;t her name, and became en|grafted into a family, without being ac|quainted with an individual per&s;on in it, and a&s;&s;umed the title of wife to the Mar|quis of D'Illois, without having con|&s;idered the duties of one, or the lea&s;t inclination to fulfil them if &s;he had.

<P>ANOTHER night when the Mar|quis and his party had been in|dulging them&s;elves with a few innocent midnight frolies, &s;uch as knocking at people's doors to frighten them out of their bed; breaking a multitude of lan|terns; beating &s;everal poor old men and women, and then &s;ending them home with their faces blacked and their hands tied behind them; they found them&s;elves tired, and being in a quarter of the town where they were unknown, they went into one of the lowe&s;t kind of hou&s;es that are open for public entertainment to refre&s;h them&s;elves; they &s;eated them&s;elves on a dir|ty form, round a grea&s;y deal table, en|lightened only by the melancholy end of a

Ju&s;t after he had left the place he met with a labouring man, to whom he pointed out his per&s;ecutor Count D'Arbannes, and giving the man a direction where to meet with him, promi&s;ed him a louis if he would watch the Count home, and bring him word who he was, and where he lived. Having taken this mo&s;t probable method to procure the wi&s;hed-for information, he returned to Paris &s;o exceedingly &s;hocked and a&s;hamed of the treatment he had re|ceived,

<PB N="243" REF="238">Count was but ju&s;t ri&s;en, &s;carce awake, and hardly remembered the tran&s;action of the night before, much le&s;s recollected the per&s;on of the metamorpho&s;ed Abb&eacute;; but being really a brave man, he made no &s;cru|ple to obey the &s;ummons, dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in ha&s;te, put on his &s;word, got with him into an hackney coach, and &s;oon ar|rived at the tree where they had met the evening before. The Count drew his &s;word, and retreating a few paces, put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence, but the Abb&eacute; in&s;tantly pre&s;enting a loaded pi&s;tol; <Q>&startq;Stop, (&s;aid he), we are not as yet on an equal footing; you forced me to &s;ing again&s;t my will, and you &endq;&s;hall now dance to plea&s;e me.</Q> In vain the Count expo&s;tulated that the &s;word was the only method to revenge the affront a gentleman had received, without any other retaliation whatever; the Abb&eacute;
<PB N="244" REF="239">calmly refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to any &s;olicitation, and told him cooly he would blow his brains out in&s;tantly if he did not com|ply: the Count prote&s;ted he never danced, that it was an exerci&s;e he never u&s;ed; that he had &s;prained his ancle, and was incapable of dancing even if he wi&s;hed it; but every entreaty or excu&s;e were equally vain. With the pi&s;tol levelled at his head, the Abb&eacute; obliged him to begin and dance alternately the Minuet de la Cour, Gavote, Rigadoon, and Allemande, which the Count having complied with, the Abb&eacute; fired his pi&s;tol in the air, drew his &s;word, and declared he was now ready to give the Count &s;atisfaction in the way he cho&s;e to demand it: vexed to the very &s;oul at the treatment he had met with, he fought with more pa&s;&s;ion than pru|dence, and was quickly di&s;armed by the Abb&eacute;, who in&s;tantly granted him his
<PB N="245" REF="240">life, in a manner which did honour both to his genero&s;ity and humanity. The Count could not but admire the bravery of his conduct, and the &s;teadine&s;s he had &s;hewn to return the in&s;ult he had met with; but as the Count naturally con|cluded this new method of teaching &s;ing|ing and dancing, would be a good deal talked of, he thought it prudent to make a journey into Italy for a few months 'till it was a little forgotten.</P>

<P>ASTONISHED at the u&s;age &s;he received, Madame D'Illois wearied her&s;elf in expo&s;tulations with the guard, and repeated her a&s;&s;urances that they would &s;everely repent this treatment of a woman of quality; they laughed at her anger, and de&s;pi&s;ed her threats: the foot|men who in vain undertook to defend her, received a &s;hower of blows, were obliged to yield to &s;uperior numbers, and were dragged by the &s;ide of the carriage with their hands tied behind them.

<PB N="276" REF="271">conceived ju&s;tified his opinion of the Marchione&s;s not being his wife, but he was a &s;ingle man; had he been mar|ried, he would not have required any other proof in her behalf, than the very delay which he now interpreted &s;o unfavourably.</P>

<P>AN old fa&s;hioned, vulgar hu&s;band would have in&s;tantly ordered the Abb&eacute; to have been thrown out of the window, but to the well-bred Marquis this &s;cene appeared &s;o extremely comic, that he laughed mo&s;t immoderately, and his extraordinary mirth &s;o very un&s;ea&s;on|able, though an additional &s;ource of con|fu&s;ion to the Abb&eacute;, gave the Mar|chione&s;s &s;ome time for recollection, who addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the Marquis with great gravity, <Q>Cea&s;e, Sir, (&s;aid &s;he) &startq;this unbecoming gaiety; learn, that the gentleman pre&s;ent is a very re&s;|pectable per&s;on, who&s;e pious advice I have long followed in all religious matters, and, after having made an
<PB N="298" REF="293">a&s;&s;ignation with you for this evening, it appeared to me to have &s;o much the air of an intrigue, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to reconcile it to the nice &s;en&s;ibility of a woman of virtue; I felt, therefore, infinite repugnance to comply with it, and as I had been very unea&s;y during the time of the ball, I called as I came from the Duke's on this pious man, to lay before him the &s;cruples of my con|&s;cience, and reque&s;t his advice on &s;o delicate a &s;ubject; he was gone to bed, and came down to me in ha&s;te, (concluding the bu&s;ine&s;s was urgent,) when, without giving him time to new dre&s;s his hair, I brought him hither immediately, where I could at lei&s;ure li&s;ten to his arguments, and that he might likewi&s;e have an opportunity to &endq;acquaint you with his deci&s;ion.</Q></P>

<P>AT the conclu&s;ion of this fine &s;peech, (which had not even the &s;hadow of probability,) Mon&s;ieur D'Illois laughed yet louder than before; and the ro&s;e-co|loured night cap giving great cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect the &s;everity of the Abb&eacute;'s virtue, he called in the &s;ervants from the anti-chamber, and ordered them to treat this director of con&s;ciences with a good drub|bing, and then to turn him into the &s;treet, <Q>That he may ever remember for &startq;the future (&s;aid the Marquis), that it is a very great breach of politene&s;s and re&s;pect to vi&s;it a lady in his night &endq;cap.</Q> The Abb&eacute; on hearing this &s;entence threw him&s;elf on his knees, and begged forgivene&s;s in the mo&s;t abject
<PB N="300" REF="295">manner, but in vain, for the Marchio|ne&s;s, enraged at his cowardice and mean behaviour at this exigence, ordered them to be&s;tow a few more blows on him on her account, to revenge (&s;he &s;aid) his &s;evere and frequent reprehen|&s;ions on her too great fondne&s;s for public diver&s;ions: the footmen, who enjoyed exceedingly the caning an Abb&eacute; with impunity, executed their orders with great alacrity, and then putting him out of the door, wi&s;hed him good night.</P>

<P>THE Marquis remained with the Marchione&s;s, and left her in the morning without the lea&s;t reproof for her ill conduct, or ever once &s;eeming to &s;u&s;|pect that any di&s;honour had been intend|ed him; he then took leave of her with the greate&s;t politene&s;s, and went to drink chocolate with a celebrated tragic actre&s;s, who&s;e per&s;on had plea&s;ed him in the la&s;t new piece, and whom he thought worthy to appear in the character of his favourite &s;ultana. The gentleman was generous, and the lady complying, &s;o that matters could not be long &s;ettling to their mutual &s;atisfaction; the Marquis promi&s;ed on his part five-and-twenty louis a month, the nymph, the fonde&s;t attachment and un|&s;haken fidelity.</P>

<P>THE Marquis generally changed his mi&s;tre&s;s every eight days at lea&s;t, therefore, this kind of treaty &s;uited him exactly, and he determined for the future to confine his amours to ladies ea&s;y of acce&s;s; and as variety could be &s;o cheaply obtained, he thought it would be a plea&s;ant frolick to keep at the &s;ame time an actre&s;s of each theatre; there|fore, having arranged matters with this di&s;ciple of Melpomene, he next paid his devoirs to the prettie&s;t figurer at the opera, who, though &s;he did not excel in the &s;cience &s;he profe&s;&s;ed, was a fine, well-&s;haped girl of &s;eventeen, who&s;e bewitch|ing eyes, joined to a kind of childi&s;h playfulne&s;s in her manner, gained her
<PB N="303" REF="298">many admirers, and &s;he had the offer of jewels and &s;ettlements from many lovers at the &s;ame time; as yet, however, &s;he affec|ted exemplary mode&s;ty: her eyes were fixed to the ground, as if unable to &s;upport the ardent gaze of admiration, and the blu&s;h of innocence &s;eemed &s;till to glow upon her cheek. The Marquis re&s;olved to triumph over a croud of contending ri|vals, and every night he paid con&s;tant attendance to her behind the &s;cenes, where, finding his a&s;&s;iduities graciou&s;ly received, and that &s;he li&s;tened to his flat|tery with vi&s;ible preference, he one even|ing ventured to make propo&s;als for bring|ing the affair to a conclu&s;ion; <Q>Come, &startq;(&s;aid he) my charming Adelaide, let me hope you mean to be mine, deign to fix your own terms, and be a&s;&s;ured, whatever &s;um can purcha&s;e your com|pliance, &endq;&s;hall be your's.</Q> The fair one
<PB N="304" REF="299">looked grave, he&s;itated, and then replied, <Q>&startq;You are very good, very generous, Sir &mdash;but this is an affair in which I am not at liberty to act for my&s;elf&mdash;it is a mat|ter which mu&s;t be entirely regulated &endq;by my mama.</Q> The Marquis pleaded with her, and u&s;ed all the rhetoric he was ma&s;ter of, to prevail on her to &s;peak her own terms; entreaties were vain, he could not obtain any other an&s;wer, than, <Q>that &startq;her mama would be glad to &s;ee him at &endq;eleven the next day.</Q></P>

<P>THE Marquis was too anxious to terminate this important affair, not to be exact to the hour &s;he mentioned; and on being introduced to the pretended mama, &s;he heard his propo&s;als with at|tention, and pondered on them in &s;ilence; at length, <Q>Sir, (&s;aid &s;he to the Mar|quis, &startq;gravely,) we may, perhaps, &s;et|tle this affair, for it now draws near the time in which I wi&s;h to fix Made|moi&s;elle Adelaide in a proper &s;ituation; merit and per&s;on are not of con&s;e|quence in the favoured lover of the ladies of the opera, they are obliged to chu&s;e tho&s;e who can be&s;t repay the expence, in &s;ome degree which their
<PB N="306" REF="301">parents have been at in their educa|tion, therefore my determination has long been fixed that &s;he &s;hall accept the mo&s;t liberal lover, and have made her &s;olemnly promi&s;e to &s;ubmit every propo&s;al to my wi&s;dom and expe|rience. This condition &s;he has faithfully complied with, and I re|gularly give audience every morning to hear the terms of different gentle|men, regi&s;ter the names, quality, and offers of each, carefully in a book &endq;I keep for that purpo&s;e.</Q></P>

<P>WHEN the provident mama had &s;aid this, &s;he ro&s;e, and unlock|ing a table drawer, took out a book with a parchment cover, then putting on her &s;pectacles turned over a great number of leaves with great earne&s;tne&s;s and applica|cation, making at the &s;ame time calcula|tions on her fingers; the Marquis &s;at in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, wondering what would be the event of all this; the old woman continued to mutter to her&s;elf, and would &s;hake her head frequently for &s;ome time; at la&s;t &s;he took off her &s;pectacles, and addre&s;&s;ing Mon&s;ieur D'Illois with great
<PB N="308" REF="303">gravity, <Q>I wi&s;h you joy, Sir, (&s;aid &startq;&s;he) Adelaide is your's; your offers are the mo&s;t truly generous of any of her lovers; you de&s;erve &s;uch a trea&s;ure, for never was there a more innocent heart; and I really think the &s;urrender I make to you of &s;o lovely a girl, de|&s;erves an hundred louis for a new gown for my-&s;elf, be&s;ides the fifty per month you are to pay her; but if you refu&s;e to comply with this &s;mall gratuity to me, our treaty is at an end, if not, &s;he is &endq;your own.</Q> The Marquis agreed to the&s;e conditions, and Adelaide being called, declared with blu&s;hes, that he, of all her lovers, had alone made &s;uffi|cient impre&s;&s;ion on her heart to induce her to wi&s;h that he might meet with the approbation of her mama; yet, &s;uch was the re&s;erve and delicacy of her &s;enti|ments and behaviour, that it was near
<PB N="309" REF="304">three days before he could prevail on her to admit him as a favoured lover, though both mama and her&s;elf acknow|ledged <Q>&s;uch was her predilection in &startq;favour of the Marquis from the fir&s;t moment &s;he beheld him, that her heart mu&s;t have been ab&s;olutely broken, had not the genero&s;ity of his offers been &endq;worthy her acceptance.</Q></P>

<P>SOON after his conque&s;t over this ve&s;tal of the theatre, the Marquis paid his devoirs to the lovelie&s;t of the Italian &s;ingers: a fine figure, and a pair of large black eyes had obtained her the preference of the Marquis over the re&s;t of her companions; but on his fir&s;t lu|crative propo&s;ition, the generous creature bur&s;t into tears: <Q>To what am I reduced &startq;(&s;aid &s;he, in a tone of indignation) that you &s;hould for a &s;ingle moment &s;uppo&s;e me capable of &s;elling my&s;elf for intere&s;t?

<PB N="311" REF="306">accept it with plea&s;ure, yet di&s;dain &endq;every &s;ordid idea of gain.</Q> The Mar|quis was &s;urprized to the la&s;t degree to meet with a di&s;intere&s;ted woman; he was charmed with the genero&s;ity of her mind, and u&s;ed every art and every delicate at|tention to gain the heart of this &s;entimen|tal nymph, who&s;e virtue was at length &s;o far &s;ubdued as to grant him an a&s;&s;igna|tion gratis.</P>
