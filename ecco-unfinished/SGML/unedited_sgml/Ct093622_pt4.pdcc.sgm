<HEAD>THE PROCESSION: ON THE FUNERAL OF QUEEN MARY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. STEELE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This di&s;tingui&s;hed writer, who was a native of Dublin (his father being private &s;ecretary to James duke of Ormond), was educated with Mr. Addi&s;on at the Charter-hou&s;e. His inclination taking a military turn, he entered into the guards, where he &s;oon obtained an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion; and in that &s;tation commenced author, by writing his "Chri&s;tian Hero," printed in 1701, and in&s;cribed to the lord Cutts, under whom he &s;erved; and followed in the next year by "The Funeral," a comedy; which recom|mended him to the notice of king William, but too late in that monarch's life to be of any u&s;e to Mr. Steele. In 1703 his "Tender Hu&s;band" was acted; as was
<Q>&startq;The Lying Lovers&endq; in 1704.</Q>
His next appearance as a wri|ter was, in his own words,
<Q>&startq;in the quality of the lowe&s;t mini&s;ter of &s;tate, as gazetteer;&endq; an office he owed to Mr. Addi&s;on's introducing him to the earls of Hallifax and Sun|derland.</Q>
In 1709 he began "The Tatler;" and was &s;oon after made one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;tamp-office. When he laid down this paper, we are told by Mr. Gay,
<Q>&startq;his di&s;appearing &s;eemed to be bewailed as &s;ome general calamity: every one wanted &s;o agreeable an amu&s;ement: and the coffee-hou&s;es began to be &s;en&s;ible that the E&s;quire's lucubrations alone had brought them more cu&s;tomers than all their other news-papers put together. It mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;&s;ed, that never man threw-up his pen under &s;tronger temptations to have employed it longer; his re|putation was at a greater height than, I believe, ever any living author's was before him. It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that his gains were proportionably con&s;iderable; every one read him with plea&s;ure and good-will: and the Tories, in re&s;pect to his other good qualities, had almo&s;t forgiven his unaccountable imprudence in declaring again&s;t them. La&s;tly, it was highly improbable, if he threw off a character, the ideas of which were &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed in every one's mind, however finely he might write in any new form, that he &s;hould meet with the &s;ame reception. To give you my own thoughts of this gentleman's writings, I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place ob&s;erve, that there is this noble difference between him and all the re&s;t of our polite and gallant authors: the latter have endeavoured to plea&s;e the age by falling-in with them, and encouraging them in their fa&s;hionable vices, and fal&s;e notions of things. It would have been a je&s;t &s;ome time &s;ince, for a man to have a&s;&s;erted that any thing witty could be &s;aid in prai&s;e of a married &s;tate; or that devotion and virtue were any way ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the character of a fine gentleman. Bicker&s;taff ven|tured to tell the town, that they were a parcel of fops, fools, and vain coquettes; but in &s;uch a manner, as even plea&s;ed them, and made them more than half-inclined to believe that he &s;poke truth. In&s;tead of complying with the fal&s;e &s;entiments or vicious ta&s;tes of the age, either in morality, critici&s;m, or good-breeding; he has boldly a&s;&s;ured them, that they were altogether in the wrong, and commanded them, with an authority which perfectly well became him, to &s;urrender them&s;elves to his arguments for virtue and good-&s;en&s;e. It is incredible to conceive the effect his writings have had on the town; how many thou&s;and fol|lies they have either quite bani&s;hed, or given a very great $heck to; how much countenance they have added to virtue and religion; how many people they have rendered happy, by &s;hewing them it was their own fault if they were not &s;o; and, la&s;tly, how entirely they have convinced our fops and young fellows of the value and advantages of learning. He has indeed re&s;cued it out of the hands of pedants and fools, and di&s;covered the true method of making it amiable and lovely to all mankind. In the dre&s;s he gives it, it is a mo&s;t welcome gue&s;t at tea-tables and a&s;&s;emblies, and is reli&s;hed and care&s;&s;ed by the mer|chants on The Change; accordingly there is not one lady at court, nor a banker in Lombard-&s;treet, who is not ve|rily per&s;uaded, that Captain Steele is the greate&s;t &s;cholar and be&s;t ca&s;ui&s;t of any man in England.&endq;</Q>
In 1710-11, in concert with Mr. Addi&s;on, he &s;et up "The Spectator;" a work, which, as Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erves,
<Q>&startq;comprizes precepts of critici&s;m, &s;allies of invention, de&s;criptions of life, and lectures of virtue; it employs wit in the cau&s;e of truth, and makes elegance &s;ub&s;ervient to piety: it has now for more than half a century &s;upplied the Engli&s;h nation, in a great mea&s;ure, with principles of &s;peculation, and rules of prac|tice; and given Addi&s;on a claim to be numbered among the benefactors of mankind.&endq;</Q>
In 1712-13, Mr. Steele began "The Guardian;" and in 1713, "The Engli&s;hman," under which latter title he began a &s;econd collection in 1715. In 1713 he was cho&s;en member for Stockbridge; but was expelled March 15, 1713, for &s;ome libellous paragraphs in "The Engli&s;hman." &mdash;
<Q>&startq;I am in a thou&s;and troubles for poor Dick, (&s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on, in a letter to Mr. Hughes, October 12, 1713), and wi&s;h that his zeal for the publick may not be ruinous to him&s;elf; but he has &s;ent me word, that he is determined to go on; and that any advice I can give him in this particular will have no weight with him.&endq;</Q>
Mr. Addi&s;on (as the event &s;hewed) was too true a prophet. &mdash; In the eighth number of
<Q>&startq;The Engli&s;hman,&endq;</Q>
Oct. 22, 1713, Mr. Steele in&s;erted a letter, giving notice that "The Cri&s;is" was then ready for the pre&s;s; and concluding in the&s;e words:
<Q>&startq;The price of this di&s;cour&s;e will be but one &s;hilling; and per&s;ons who are willing to &s;ub&s;cribe for numbers of them, are de&s;ired to leave their names and &s;uch numbers with Mr. Samuel Buckley, at the Dolphin in Little Britain. I beg the fa|vour of you to in&s;ert this in your very next paper; for I &s;hall govern my&s;elf in the number I print according to the number of &s;ub&s;criptions.&endq;</Q>
After the &s;ub&s;cription had con|tinued open more than two months, "The Engli&s;hman;" Number 26, Dec. 26, acquainted the public, that,
<Q>&startq;at the de&s;ire of &s;everal ladies of quality, the publication of "The Cri&s;is" is put off till the female world have expre&s;&s;ed their zeal for the publick, by a &s;ub&s;cription as large as that made among the other &s;ex.&endq;</Q>
This pamphlet at length appeared on the 19th of January, 1714. In the revi|&s;al and correction of it, he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Bi&s;hop Hoadly, Mr. Addi&s;on, Mr. Lechmere, and Mr. Min&s;hall. &mdash; At the end of 1713, Mr. Steele began "The Lover;" and in 1714, "The Reader." In this year he appeared as editor of a vo|lume of Mi&s;cellaneous Poems; and wrote
<Q>&startq;The Romi&s;h Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of late Years;&endq;</Q>
and in 1715,
<Q>&startq;An Account of the State of the Roman Catholic Religion throughout the World.&endq;</Q>
In April that year, he was knighted by king George I; who had before appointed him &s;urveyor of the royal &s;tables at Hampton Court, and governor of the royal company of comedians. In the &s;ame year he collected &s;everal of his pieces into a volume, under the title of "Political Writings;" and publi&s;hed a paper called "The Town Talk;" in 1718,
<Q>&startq;An Account of the Fi&s;h Pool;&endq;</Q>
in 1719, "The Spin&s;ter," and
<Q>&startq;A Letter to the Earl of Oxford concerning the Bill of Peerage:&endq;</Q>
and, January 2, 1719-20, began "The Theatre;" a ta&s;k which &s;eems to have been &s;oon laid a&s;ide. In the twenty-eighth number the Author ob&s;erved, that this paper
<Q>&startq;was not the product of a mind at ea&s;e, but written by a man neither out of pain in body or mind; yet forced to &s;u&s;pend the angui&s;h of both with the addition of powerful men &s;oli|citing his ruin, &s;hy looks from his acquaintance, &s;urly be|haviour from his dome&s;ticks, with all the train of public and private calamity.&endq;</Q>
He took leave of the town with a promi&s;e of "printing a new comedy called Sir John Edgar;" and at the &s;ame time &s;olicited &s;upport in a de&s;ign by which might be divided "above ten <HI>per cent.</HI> &s;ix times a year." Sir Richard was &s;martly attacked for "The Theatre" by Mr. Dennis, when he had publi&s;hed &s;ix numbers, in a pamphlet called "The Characters and Conduct of Sir John Edgar," the name he had a&s;&s;umed in that publication. (This latter paper, "The Town Talk," and "The Spin&s;ter," have not yet been collected into volumes.)&mdash;On the 23d of that month, his parent of governor of the royal comedians was revoked; on which he printed a &s;tate of the ca&s;e between the lord chamberlain and him&s;elf, computing his lo&s;s at almo&s;t 10,000 l. He publi&s;hed "The Cri&s;is of Property," Jan. 31, 1719-20; and,
<Q>&startq;A Nation a Family; being the Se|quel of "The Cri&s;is of Property;" or a Plan for the Im|provement of the South-Sea Propo&s;al,&endq; Feb. 24.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>&startq;The Con&s;cious Lovers&endq; was acted with great &s;ucce&s;s in 1722; and the king, to whom it was dedicated, gave him 500 l.</Q>
Some years before his death, he grew paralytic, and retired to his &s;eat at Llangunner near Caermarthen in Wales; where he died, September 1, 1729. He had been twice married; and his great e&s;teem for his &s;econd lady is te&s;tified in a dedication to "The Ladies Library."&mdash;It appears by his "Reader," May 3, 1714, that he had materials for a Hi&s;tory of the war in Flanders; which he propo&s;ed to print in folio, but did not execute. The&s;e papers afterwards came into the hands of Mr. Mallet; to whom 500 l. was bequeathed by the dutche&s;s of Marlborough, to write the life of her decea&s;ed lord. It was intended by the dutche&s;s to have been performed jointly by Mr. Glover and Mr. Mallet, under the immediate in&s;pection of lord Che&s;terfield: but Mr. Glover re&s;igned the undertaking; and although it is probable that his colleague had the papers directed by the dutche&s;s de|livered to him, and it is certain was &s;everal years employed about the work (which, he informed the duke of Marlborough in a dedication to his poems, 1762, was &s;o far executed, that he hoped <HI>&s;oon</HI> to pre&s;ent it to him); yet it is &s;aid, at the time of Mr. Mallet's death, in April, 1765, he had made but &s;mall progre&s;s in it.&mdash;Sir Richard was one of the la&s;t eminent men who entertained hopes of being &s;ucce&s;sful in the pur&s;uit of the Philo&s;opher's Stone; a circum&s;tance alluded to in the following couplet of "The Briti&s;h Cen&s;or," a &s;atire leveled at Steele, in 1712:
<Q><L>"A Chemi&s;t now, who&s;e vain projection broke,</L>
<L>"Was not his &s;en&s;e in part di&s;&s;olv'd in &s;moke?"</L></Q>
His Laboratory was at Poplar, a village near London; and is now converted into a garden-hou&s;e.&mdash;See an excellent poe|$ical character of Mr. Steele, in vol. III. p. 77. N.</NOTE>. 1695.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>TO MR.

If the patron is but known to have a ca&s;tle for what is pre&s;ented to him, it gives an hopeful idea of the woark; how much more, when he is an acknowledged ma&s;ter of the art he is de&s;ired to favour? Your ju&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in the va|rious parts of poetry, will make your approbation of the fol|lowing &s;heets a favour to many ingenious gentlemen, who&s;e mode&s;ty wants the &s;anction of &s;uch an authority. Men of your talents oblige the world, when they are &s;tudious to pro|duce in others the &s;imilitude of their excellences. Your great di&s;cerning in di&s;tingui&s;hing the characters of mankind, which is manife&s;ted in your comedies, renders your good opinion a ju&s;t foundation for the e&s;teem of other men. I know, indeed, no argument again&s;t the&s;e collections, in compari&s;on of any other Ton&s;on has heretofore printed; but that there are in it no ver&s;es of yours&punc; that gentle, free, and ea&s;y faculty, which al&s;o in &s;ongs, and &s;hort poems, you po&s;&s;e&s;s above all others, di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf where-ever it appears. I cannot but in|&s;tance your inimitable DORIS, which excels, for politene&s;s, fine raillery, and courtly &s;atire, any thing we can meet with in any language. Give me leave to tell you, that when I con&s;ider your capacity this way, I cannot enough applaud the goodne&s;s of your mind, that has given &s;o few examples of the&s;e &s;everities, under the temptation of &s;o great applau&s;e as the ill-natured world be&s;tows on them, though addre&s;&s;ed without any mixture of your delicacy. I cannot leave my favourite Doris, without taking notice how much that &s;hort performance di&s;covers a true knowledge of life. Doris is the character of a libertine woman of condition, and the &s;atire is worked up accordingly: for people of quality are &s;eldom touched with any repre&s;entation of their vices, but in a light which makes them ridiculous. As much as I e&s;teem you for your excellent writings, by which you are an honour to our nation: I chu&s;e rather, as one that has pa&s;&s;ed many happy hours with you, to celebrate that ea&s;y conde&s;cen&s;ion of mind, and command of a plea&s;ant imagination, which give you the uncommon prai&s;e of a man of wit, always to plea&s;e, and never to offend. No one, after a joyful evening, can reflect upon an expre&s;&s;ion of Mr. Congreve's, that dwells upon him with pain. In a man capable of exerting him&s;elf any way, this (whatever the vain and ill-natured may think of the matter) is an excellence above the brighte&s;t &s;allies of ima|gination. The reflection upon this mo&s;t equal, amiable, and correct behaviour, which can be ob&s;erved only by your inti|mate acquaintance, has quite diverted me from acknow|ledging your &s;everal excellences as a writer; but to dwell particularly on tho&s;e &s;ubjects, would have no very good effect upon the following performances of my&s;elf and friends: thus, I confe&s;s to you, your mode&s;ty is &s;pared only by my vanity, and yet I hope you will give me leave to indulge it yet further, in telling all the world, I am, with great truth, Sir, your mo&s;t obedient, and mo&s;t humble &s;ervant,

<HEAD>EPIGRAM FROM MARTIAL <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With all per&s;ons who have made good &s;en&s;e the rule of action, marriage is de&s;cribed as the &s;tate capable of the highe&s;t human felicity. Tully has epi&s;tles full of affectionate plea|&s;ure, when he writes to his wife, or &s;peaks of his children. But above all the hints of this kind I have met with in writers of ancient date, I am plea&s;ed with an epigram of Martial, in honour of the beauty of his wife Cleopatra. Commentators &s;ay, it was written the day after his wedding-night. When his &s;pou&s;e was retired to the bathing-room in the heat of the day, he, it &s;eems, came in upon her when &s;he was ju&s;t going into the water. To her beauty and carriage on that occa&s;ion we owe this epigram. STEELE.&mdash;See in The Spectator, No. 490, &s;ome excellent remarks on this &s;ubject. N.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ODE TO ST. CECILIA <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The twenty-&s;econd of November, a day appropriated by the calendar of the church of Rome to Saint Cecilia, was re|ligiou&s;ly ob&s;erved in mo&s;t parts of Europe. This lady was eminently beautiful and pious, particularly &s;kilful in mu&s;ic, and a martyr for the Chri&s;tian faith. Towards the latter end of the la&s;t century an entertainment was in&s;tituted in commemoration of her, by many of the fir&s;t rank in this kingdom; which was continued annually for a con&s;iderable time. A &s;plendid entertainment was provided at Stationers Hall, which was con&s;tantly pr$ceded by a performance of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic by the mo&s;t capital performers. This fea&s;t is repre&s;ented by Mr. Motteux, in 1691, as
<Q>&startq;one of the genteele&s;t in the world; there are no formalities nor gatherings like as at others, and the appearance there is &s;plendid.&endq;</Q>
The words, which were always an encomium on their patrone&s;s, were &s;et by Purcell, Blow, and others of the greate&s;t eminence; and it became the fa&s;hion for writers of all ranks to celebrate Saint Cecilia. Dryden, Pope, Addi&s;on, Yalden, employed their talents on this &s;ubject. We have al&s;o Odes to Saint Cecilia by Shadwell, D'Urfey, and &s;ome &s;till more indifferent poets. But we may pardon the tra&s;h which this fertile &s;ubject has given birth to, on account of the excellence of Mr. Dryden's mo&s;t admirable perform|ance. It appears by Mr. Motteux that there were, in 1691, "admirable concerts in Charles-&s;treet and York-buildings." N.</NOTE>,</HEAD>

<HEAD>HORACE, BOOK I. ODE IX.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>IMITATED BY MR. FENTON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Elijah Fenton, de&s;cended from an antient family, and born at Shelton, near Newca&s;tle under Line, in Stafford&s;hire, being the younge&s;t of twelve children, was intended by his parents for the mini&s;try. He was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, where he embraced principles very oppo&s;ite to the government, by which he became di&s;qualified for entering into holy orders. After quitting the univer&s;ity, he was for &s;ome time u&s;her to Mr. Bonwicke, a celebrated &s;chool-ma&s;ter at Headley in Surrey; and afterwards became &s;ecretary to the earl of Orrery: but how long he remained in that &s;tation, we cannot a&s;certain. After he quitted the &s;ervice of this noble peer, it was his cu&s;tom to pay a yearly vi&s;it in the country to his brother, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate of 1000l. per annum. He was a man of great tenderne&s;s and humanity, and carried the faire&s;t reputation. After a life at the clo&s;e of it &s;pent in ea&s;e and tranquillity, he died at Ea&s;t-Hamp&s;tead-Park, near Oakingham, on the 13th of July, 1730, much regretted by all men of ta&s;te, as, what is very &s;ingular, having never been obnoxious to the re|&s;entment of his brother-poets. He publi&s;hed in 1709 the volume whence this and the following poems of his are taken, under the title of "Oxford and Cambridge Ver&s;es," printed for Lin|$ott, without a date. In 1717 he publi&s;hed a volume of his own poems, and in 1723 introduced upon the &s;tage his tragedy of Mariamne, built upon the &s;tory related of her in the third volume of The Spectator, which the ingenious author collected out of Jo&s;ephus. He publi&s;hed al&s;o a very fine edition of the works of Mr. Edmund Waller, illu&s;trated with full and u&s;eful notes of his own; and wrote a Life of Milton, which Dr. John&s;on very hand&s;omely commends. Mr. Fenton was much beloved and e&s;teemed by Mr. Pope, who honoured him with an epitaph. The "Oxford and Cambridge Ver&s;es" were thus in&s;cribed to Lionel earl of Dor&s;et and Middle&s;ex:</P>
<P>"My Lord, I hope, on your return from having been ad|mired in foreign Courts to adorn our own, you will not be &s;urprized with a privilege the Poets a&s;&s;ume, of being trouble|&s;ome to per&s;ons of your rank. But they have more particu|larly applied them&s;elves to your Lord&s;hip's family; in which a continued race of Genius has both advanced their art, and encouraged its profe&s;&s;ors. We owe the ri&s;e of our Engli&s;h Tragedy to one of your Lord&s;hip's ance&s;tors, who fixed us &s;econd to the Greek &s;tage before Shake&s;peare wrote. And, my Lord, your father came the neare&s;t of all the moderns to Horace, in the &s;weetne&s;s and gallantry of his Lyricks, and equalled him in Satire. Thus the &s;tream flows pure in its de&s;cent, to receive a farther increa&s;e from your Lord&s;hip. We read of a Scipio and a Maecenas, who u&s;ed to &s;often the trou|ble&s;ome honours of &s;tate by conver&s;ing with the Mu&s;es; and cheri&s;hed tho&s;e arts of which they them&s;elves were ma&s;ters: yet as &s;ingle in&s;tances of this kind are not frequent, &s;o the vein is very &s;eldom found to have continued a &s;econd genera|tion. But, in your Lord&s;hip's line, Nature &s;eems indu&s;trious to pre&s;erve the genius of Poetry, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ively uniting deli|cacy of ta&s;te, and brightne&s;s of wit, with the greate&s;t abili|ties for council and action. Thus &s;he reconciles the Sea&s;ons in her mo&s;t generous productions, by allowing them to bear Fruit and Blo&s;&s;oms together, and both in perfection. The&s;e &s;hining qualities made your Father the delight and wonder of his age; and had he not &s;urvived him&s;elf in your Lord&s;hip, he had been the envy of ours. The prai&s;es which he received from the mo&s;t refined Wits of our nation have proved real prophecies of you; and it is with plea&s;ure we fore&s;ee that po&s;terity, to de&s;erve the highe&s;t characters, will form them&s;elves on the model of your family, and copy from my Lords of Dor&s;et as the fine&s;t originals. But, my Lord, I am afraid I &s;hall forfeit all hopes of your patronage, by violating your mode&s;ty; and therefore I only beg leave to add, that as the Cabinet and the Field have been happily &s;upplied, to render her Maje&s;ty's reign, at lea&s;t, a rival to her Virgin-predece&s;&s;or's; &s;o, to complete the parallel, it was nece&s;&s;ary that you, my Lord, like another Sidney, &s;hould ari&s;e, to receive the &s;ofter arts into your protection; to excite the young Writers of this age to attempt tho&s;e actions in ver&s;e, which will &s;hine &s;o fairly di&s;tingui&s;hed in our Briti&s;h &s;tory.

<HEAD>THE WRECK. A SATIRE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JAMES GARDINER <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Dr. James Gardiner, Bp. of Lincoln; born at We&s;tmin&s;ter in 1678, and admitted of Immanuel College, Cambridge, in 1694; where having taken the degree of B. A. he removed to Je&s;us College, obtained a fellow&s;hip, and pro|ceeded M. A. During his re&s;idence at the Univer&s;ity, he was a&s;&s;iduous in &s;tudy, and acquired, by repeated peru&s;al of the cla&s;&s;ics, a turn to poetry. His tran&s;lation of
<Q>&startq;Rapin of Gardens&endq;</Q>
was publi&s;hed in 1704, as a farewell to the Mu&s;es, upon his entering into holy orders, and accepting of the &s;ub|deanry of London, in 1705. A &s;econd edition of this tran|&s;lation was printed in 1717, with alterations which reflect much credit on Mr. Gardiner's judgement. This is the &s;ub|&s;tance of what I can meet with of this ingenious poet's hi&s;|tory. Jacob has pre&s;erved the three following &s;tanzas tran|&s;cribed from the middle of an epitaph on this writer's father:

The fe&s;tivity appears to have been al&s;o celebrated at Oxford, and to have been continued there $ger: at lea&s;t, I have two Odes to St. Cecilia, one in 1707 $o&s;ed by Mr. Purcell, the other in 170$ by Dr. Blow, $word$ performed at St. Mary Hall in Oxon, by Mr. S$unders $ and Mr. Court, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the be&s;t voices and hands." Mr. Addi&s;on's Ode was performed there in 1699; and he as "a Song," without date, on the &s;ame occa&s;ion. N.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

And Oldmixon, in his "Art of Logic and Rhetoric," p. 413, is not &s;paring of his reflexions on the poet and his patron. His cen&s;ures, however, are plainly tho&s;e of a di&s;appointed competitor. And perhaps great part of the ridicule, which has been thrown on Eu&s;den, may ari&s;e from his &s;ucceeding &s;o ingenious a poet as Mr. Rowe. That he was no incon&s;i|derable ver&s;i&s;ter, the &s;pecimens here &s;elected will evince; and&punc; as his moral character appears to have been re&s;pectable, his Grace acted a generous, art in providing for a man who had conferred an obligation on him. The fir&s;t-rate poets were either of principles very different from the government, or thought them&s;elves to$ di&s;tingui&s;hed to undergo the drudgery of an annual Ode. Mr. Eu&s;den, however, &s;eems to have been but little known before his preferment, if we judge by the manner in which he is mentioned in the Duke of Buck|ingham's "Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets:"
<Q><L>"In ru&s;hed Eu&s;dem, and cried, who &s;hall have it,</L>

He died at his re&s;tory at Coning&s;by, Lincoln&s;hire, the 27th of September, 1730; and left behind him in MS. a tran&s;lation of the Works of Ta&s;&s;o, with a Life of that Poet. His father, Dr. Eu&s;den, was rector of Spot&s;worth in York&s;hire. N.</P>
<P>In &s;ome old book, which I cannot recollect, I have &s;een it ob&s;erved, that Eu&s;den &s;et out well in life, but afterwards turned out a drunkard, and be&s;otted his faculties away. R.</P></NOTE>, ON A LADY WHO IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND WITTY WHEN SHE IS ANGRY.</BYLINE>

Cromwell, and Charles II. for whom he &s;ecured that kingdom; and by his Plays, Poems, Treati&s;e on the Art of War, State Letters, &amp;c. Of the&s;e works the fir&s;t and the la&s;t were collected and publi&s;hed by his great-grand&s;on John Earl of Orrery (and afterwards of Corke), in 1739 and 1742. He al&s;o wrote "Partheni&s;&s;a," a Romance; poems on mo&s;t of the Fe&s;tivals of the Church; a poem on the Re&s;toration; a political poem (of which Charles II. took a copy in MS.) called "A Dream;" &amp;c. &amp;c. It is ob&s;ervable that he com|po&s;ed mo&s;t of his pieces when confined by the gout; which made Mr. Dryden tell him, in a dedication, that,
<Q>&startq;like the prie&s;te&s;s of Apollo, he delivered his oracles always in tor|ment,&endq;</Q> and that
<Q>&startq;the world was obliged to his mi&s;ery for their delight.&endq;</Q>
Charles II. for his &s;ervices, created him Earl of Orrery in 1660, made him one of the Lords Ju&s;tices of Ireland, Pre&s;ident of Mun&s;ter, and one of the Cabinet Council, and offered him the great &s;eal upon the fall of the Earl of Clarendon, which his infirm health prevented his ac|cepting. See Budgell's Memoirs of the Boyles, p. 112. He died Oct. 16, 1679. Jacob &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;he publi&s;hed &s;ix plays in heroick ver&s;e; wherein true Engli&s;h courage is exactly de|lineated, and morality and virtue truly illu&s;trated.&endq;</Q>
His grand&s;on Charles the fourth Earl (of whom &s;ee p. 70), is well known by his controver&s;y, when a commoner, with Dr. Bentley; as is his great-grand&s;on John (above-mentioned) by his Tran&s;lation of Pliny's Epi&s;tles, Life of Swift, Letters from Italy, &amp;c. &mdash;"By one or other of this family, &s;ays Dr. John&s;on, almo&s;t every art has been encouraged or improved."

<HEAD>MR. HARRISON <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William Harri&s;on e&s;&abque; a young gentleman high in e&s;|teem, and (as Swift expre&s;&s;es it)
<Q>&startq;a little pretty fellow, with a great deal of wit, good &s;en&s;e, and good nature,&endq;</Q>
and fellow of New College, Oxford, had no other income than forty pounds a year as tutor to one of the duke of Queen&s;berry's &s;ons. In this employment he fortunately attracted the favour of Dr. Swift, who&s;e generous &s;olicitations with Mr. St. John obtained for him the reputable employment of &s;ecretary to lord Raby, afterwards earl of Strafford, and then amba&s;&s;ador at The Hague. A letter of his whil&s;t at Utrecht, dated Dec. 16, 1712, is printed in the Dean's Works; to which Dr. Birch has annexed &s;ome curious particulars of Mr. Harri&s;on, who did not long enjoy his ri&s;ing fortune. He was di&s;patched to London with the Barrier-treaty; and died Feb. 14, 1712-13. See the Journal to Stella, of that and the following day: where Dr. Swift laments his lo&s;s with the mo&s;t unaffected &s;incerity. Mr. Tickell has mentioned him with re&s;pect, in his "Pro&s;pect of Peace," Engli&s;h Poets, vol. XXVI. p. 113; and Dr. Young, in the beautiful clo&s;e of an "Epi&s;tle to Lord Lan&s;downe" (vol. LII. p. 185.) mo&s;t pathetically bewails his lo&s;s. Dr. Birch, who has given a curious note on Mr. Har|ri&s;on's Letter to Swift, has confounded him with <HI>Thomas</HI> Harri&s;on, M. A. of Queen's College. The poems here print|ed, with "Wood&s;tock Park" in Dod&s;ley's Collection, are all the poetical writings that are known of this excellent young man; who figured both as an humouri&s;t and a politi|cian in the fifth volume of the Tatler, of which (under the patronage of Bolingbroke, Henley, and Swift) he was profe&s;|&s;edly the editor. See the "Supplement to Swift."&mdash;There was another <HI>William</HI> Harri&s;on, author of

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. JOSEPH HAINES <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The time when this merry Comedian (u&s;ually called <HI>Count Haines)</HI> was born, is uncertain: but he received the ru|diments of learning at the &s;chool of St. Martin's in the Fields, London, where he made &s;uch progre&s;s that he was the admi|ration of all that knew him. His ready wit and facetious humour prevailed upon &s;everal gentlemen to &s;end him to Queen's College, Oxford, where his learning, and infinite f$$d of humour, gained him the e&s;teem and regard of Sir Jo|&s;eph William&s;on, who, when he was made &s;ecretary of &s;tate, took Joe for his Latin &s;ecretary. But Haines had too little t$iturnity for an employment of that kind; for Sir Jo&s;eph $span$ heard the &s;u&s;tance of his epi&s;tles to foreign courts, $word$ they could come to the hands of tho&s;e per&s;ons who were to receive them. Upon this account, Joe was removed from his employment. However, Sir Jo&s;eph recommended him to one of the heads of the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge, where he was willingly received; but a company of players coming to Stourbridge fair, near that place, Joe fell &s;o much in love with their employment and way of living, that he threw a|way his cap and band, and made one of their company. He was &s;oon called to the King's company in Drury-lane, where his inimitable performance and vivacity brought him into the familiarity of the wits of the age, and per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank, in&s;omuch, that a noble duke, going amba&s;&s;ador to France, thought it no di&s;grace to take Haines as a companion. Joe (be&s;ides the dead languages) &s;poke Italian and French to as much perfection as if he had been born both at Rome and Paris; and therefore it is no wonder to he was care&s;&s;ed by many of the French nobility. Here he took the title of Count, and by his art tricked many of the rich citizens of Paris out of large &s;ums of money. After his French expedi|tion, he returned to the &s;tage again, and had the art to form the countenances of his audience by his own; for the mu&s;cles of his face were like gaping, generally catching. His Pro|logues and Epilogues do not &s;eem extraordinary in the reading, but his manner of &s;peaking made them inimitable. The Epilogue in particular, that he &s;poke riding on an a&s;s, created &s;uch a laughter and reiterated applau&s;es, that it was near half an hour in the &s;peaking. This excellent Comedian was author of one play, "A Fatal Mi&s;take, or The Plot &s;poiled; as it was lately acted, 1692." He died of a fever (after a &s;hort illne&s;s) April 4, 1701, at his lodgings in Hart-&s;treet Long Acre, and was buried in Covent Garden church-yard. See "Briti&s;h Theatre, 1752," p. 119.

<HEAD>ON MRS. E. MONTAGUE'S BLUSHING IN THE CROSS-BATH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. FLATMAN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Flatman was born in Alder&s;gate-&s;treet about 1623, educated at Winche&s;ter, and in 1654 elected from thence to New College in Oxford, which he left without taking a degree. He afterwards &s;tudied the law in the Inner Temple; married a young lady with a good fortune, Nov. 26, 1672; died Dec. 8, 1688, in the life-time of his fa|ther (at that time a clerk in chancery, and in his 80th year); and was buried at St. Bride's, London. He is de&s;cribed by Mr. Granger as "one of the un&s;ucce&s;sful imitators of Pindar, or rather of Cowley, in a &s;pecies of poetry which plea&s;ed more from its novelty, than its excellence, in that celebrated writer. He compo&s;ed Pindaric odes on the death of the duke of Albe|marle, the earl of O&s;&s;ory, prince Rupert, and Charles II. The duke of Ormond was &s;o plea&s;ed with that on the death of the earl of O&s;&s;ory, his &s;on, that he &s;ent the author a ring, with a diamond in it, worth 100<HI>l.</HI> It is no wonder that the heart of a father, &s;oftened by the death of &s;uch a &s;on, f$lt &s;omething in reading this compo&s;ition which an indif|ferent per&s;on cannot even imagine; and mi&s;took the natural working of his own brea&s;t, for the art of the poet. Flatman really excelled as an arti&s;t: a man mu&s;t want ears for har|mony, that can admire his poetry; and even want eyes that can cea&s;e to admire his painting. Some of his ta&s;tele&s;s con|temporaries thought him equally excellent in both; but one of his heads is worth a ream of his Pindaries; I had almo&s;t &s;aid all the P$ndaries written in this reign. It does our au|thor &s;ome honour, that Mr. Pope has very clo&s;ely copied &s;e|veral of his ver&s;es, in his ode of
<Q>&startq;The dying Chri&s;tian to his So$l.&endq;</Q>
&mdash;Mr. Granger's cen&s;ure on Flatman's poetry is &s;urely too &s;evere. He was one of the writers in
<Q>&startq;Don Juan Lam|berto, or a Comical-Hi&s;tory of the late Times,&endq;</Q>
more com|monly known by the name of "Montelion's Almanack," fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1660 by J. Philips, continued in the two &s;ucceeding years by Flatman, and &s;aid to be a very facetious and entertaining work. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>ON A LADY'S PICTURE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. BROOME <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Dr. John&s;on is writing the Life of this elegant poet, I will not anticipate the entertainment my readers have &s;uch ample rea&s;on to expect, any farther than to lay before them a few plain facts; for which I am indebted to authorities which it would be pre&s;umption to mention on &s;o &s;light an occa&s;ion. William Broome, &s;prung from mean parents in Che&s;hire, was elected upon the foundation at Eaton, and had the (almo&s;t unheard-of) misfortune of being Captain of that &s;chool for one whole year, 1707, without any vacancy's hap|pening at King's College, by which means he was &s;uper-annuated. I repeat the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>almo&s;t unheard-of</HI>, as it has happened but four times in 160 years; viz. in 1619, 1653, 1707, 1756. Being an excellent Greek &s;cholar, and univer|&s;ally beloved, his friends &s;ent him to St. John's College, Cam|bridge, where by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and a &s;mall exhibition, he was maintained till he entered into orders. Soon after which, accidentally becoming acquainted with Mr. Pope (who was upon a vi&s;it to Sir John Cotton, at Madingley, three miles from Cambridge) an intimacy en&s;ued; and he tran&s;lated eight books of the Ody&s;&s;ey (as appears by a note of his own), and had the merit of being
<Q>&startq;Annotator in part upon the Iliad, and entirely upon the Ody&s;&s;ey.&endq;</Q>
That he furni&s;hed
<Q>&startq;the greater part of the Remarks from Eu&s;tathius, together with &s;everal excellent ob&s;ervations,&endq;</Q>
is acknowledged by Mr. Pope; who, it has been &s;aid, promi&s;ed him a hand&s;ome gra|tuity for his trouble, and when the work was fini&s;hed, quar|reled with him, and di&s;appointed him of the promi&s;ed reward. It is certain that Broome thus repre&s;ented the &s;tory to his friends. Yet, in a Letter to Lord Harvey, from Mr. Pope, who had been charged with
<Q>&startq;&s;elling Broome's works printed with Pope's name,&endq; he tells his lord&s;hip, he printed not his name before a line of the per&s;on's his lord&s;hip men|tions.</Q>
&mdash;"Be&s;ides, my lord, when you &s;aid I <HI>&s;old</HI> another man's works, you ought in ju&s;tice to have added that I <HI>bought</HI> them, which very much alters the ca&s;e; what I gave was five hundred pounds; his receipt can be pro|duced to your lord&s;hip." Broome and Fenton, we learn from Ruffhead, had formed a de&s;ign of tran&s;lating the Ody&s;&s;ey, while Pope was employed upon the Iliad; and went through &s;everal books of the Ody&s;&s;ey, which they de&s;ired him to peru&s;e; he complied with their reque&s;t: and, having made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the work him&s;elf, adopted what he found thus ready, for the &s;peedier advancement of his work; and indeed it is &s;ome confirmation of what is thus related, that, among the poems in Broome's fir&s;t edition, there is one "To a Gentleman who corrected &s;ome of my Ver&s;es," the title of which he afterwards thus changed: "To Mr. A. Pope, who corrected my Ver&s;es." In the Life of Pope, p. 205, it is a&s;&s;erted that Broome received from him 600l. and Fenton 300l. Probably the coadjutors, finding that Pope got more than they or he expected, were de&s;irous of coming in for a &s;hare; but, if they received what they agreed for, there &s;eems no ju&s;t ground of complaint; and though Pope was not ge|nerous on this occa&s;ion, if he had a receipt for 500l. to &s;hew, there is little more to be &s;aid on the &s;ubject.&mdash;Dr. Broome was for &s;ome time Rector of Stur&s;ton in Suffolk, whence he dates the dedication to Lord Town&s;hend (then one of the principal Secretaries of State) Jan. 16, 1726; and was at that time chaplain to Charles lord (afterwards earl) Cornwallis. At Stur&s;ton he married a lady who had a good fortune, which enabled him to take the degree of LL.D. when the king went to Cambridge, April 25, 1728. Upon his re&s;ig|nation of the living of Stur&s;ton, he was pre&s;ented by the crown to the rectory of Pulham in Norfolk, in Augu&s;t, 1733; and held it united to the rectory of Oakley Magna in Suffolk, to which he was pre&s;ented by Lord Cornwallis, who afterwards gave him the vicarage of Eye in Suffolk. The two la&s;t pre|ferments he enjoyed till his death, which happened at Bath, Nov. 16, 1745. He was buried in the abbey church there, by Dr. Gooch, bi&s;hop of Norwich. That he was favoured by the Mu&s;es, appears by his "Poems on &s;everal Occa&s;ions," fir&s;t printed in the year 1727; again in 1739; a third time in 1750; and lately in the collection of the Engli&s;h Poets. One of his poems is intituled,
<Q>&startq;Melancholy, an Ode occa&s;ioned by the Death of a beloved Daughter, 1723;&endq; but it is not quite certain that it was written on a daughter of his own.</Q>
His "Ver&s;es on the Death of a Friend," which were printed in 1727, were afterwards very happily enlarged, and applied to Mr. Fenton, who died in 1730.
<Q>&startq;In The Sacred and Profane Hi&s;tory of the World connected,&endq;</Q>
vol. III. p. 60, Dr. Broome is menttoned by Mr. Shuckford, under the title of

<HEAD>UPON THE TOASTS OF THE HANOVER CLUB.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY A. PHILIPS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ambro&s;e Philips, de&s;cended from an ancient family in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, was educated at St. John's College, Cam|bridge. On his coming to London, he &s;oon ranked among the wits at Button's. The great reputation he gained by his pa&s;torals was the occa&s;ion of Mr. Pope's writing the 40th number of the Guardian, on the merits of Philips and him&s;elf; where he repre&s;ented him&s;elf as the be&s;t ver&s;ifier, and Philips as the better Arcadian. The enemies of Pope exulted, to &s;ee him placed below Philips in a &s;pecies of poetry upon which he was &s;uppo&s;ed to value him&s;elf; but were much mortified to find that Pope him&s;elf was the real author of that paper, and that the whole critici&s;m was irony. On the acce&s;&s;ion of king George I, he was made a ju&s;tice of the peace, and a commi&s;&s;ioner of the lottery; and when Doctor Boulter was advanced to the primacy, Mr. Philips went to Ireland with him, where he had con&s;iderable preferments, and repre&s;ented the county of Armagh in parliament. Purcha&s;ing, &s;ome time after, an annuity of 400l. he returned to England in 1748; but did not live long to enjoy it. He was author of "The Life of Archbi&s;hop Williams;" was concerned with Dr. Boulter and others in "The Freethinker;" and wrote three tragedies, "The Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother," 1711; "The Briton," 1721; and "Humphrey duke of Glouce&s;ter," the &s;ame year. But his greate&s;t reputation is owing to a beau|tiful winter-piece of his in The Tatler, dated Copenhagen, May 9, 1709; which Steele calls
<Q>&startq;as fine a piece as we ever had from any of the &s;chools of the mo&s;t learned paint|&endq;ers.</Q>
&mdash; He collected and publi&s;hed his own poems a &s;hort time before his death; but it is le&s;s to be wondered at that he &s;hould omit this &s;mall epigram, than that he &s;hould have adopted (which he has done, Engli&s;h Poets, vol. XLIV. p. 371.) a &s;hort epigram of Mr. Jeffreys. See Gent. Mag&punc; Dec. 1779. N.</NOTE>; NOT PRINTED IN HIS POEMS.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>EPIGRAM ON MRS. TOFTS, A HANDSOME WOMAN WITH A FINE VOICE, BUT VERY COVETOUS AND PROUD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This epigram, fir&s;t printed anonymou&s;ly in Steele's Col|lection, and copied in the Mi&s;cellanies of Swift and Pope, is a&s;cribed to Pope by Sir John Hawkins in his Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ic &mdash;Mrs. Tofts, who was the daughter of a per&s;on in the family of Bp. Burnet, is celebrated as a $inger little in|ferior, either for her voice or manner, to the be&s;t Italian wo|men. She lived at the introduction of the opera into this kingdom, and &s;ung in company with Nicolini; but, being ig|norant of Italian, chanted her recitative in Engli&s;h, in an|&s;wer to his Italian; yet the charms of their voices overcame the ab&s;urdity. Cibber, in the Apology for his Life, p. 26, &s;peaks of her in very high terms; and in "The Tatler," No. 20, &s;he is de&s;cribed under the character of Camilla; a character, which, from her having repre&s;ented the prince&s;s in the opera of that name, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have di&s;ordered her mind. In the meridian of her beauty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large &s;um of money which &s;he had acquired by &s;inging, Mrs. Tofts quitted the &s;tage, and was married to Mr. Jo&s;eph Smith, a great collector of books, and patron of the arts; who being appointed con&s;ul at Venice, &s;he went with him. He lived in great magnificence; but, the di&s;order of his wife returning, &s;he dwelt &s;eque&s;tered from the world in a remote part of the hou&s;e, and had a large garden to range in, where &s;he would frequently walk, &s;inging and giving way to that innocent frenzy which had &s;eized her in the early part of life. She died about the year 1760; and her hu&s;band about ten years after her. His numerous and valuable collection of books was brought over to this kingdom, and &s;old by auction. N.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>BY MR.

In a letter to Mr. Hughes, ju&s;t before his death, he thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf:
<Q>&startq;Would to God you might live as long as, I am &s;ure, the reputation of your Tragedy mu&s;t!&endq;</Q>
Letters from Eminent Per&s;ons, Lett. 290. In one to his brother, ju&s;t after his death, with other elogiums,

Ibid. I. 197. And, which is &s;till more to the purpo&s;e, this la&s;t
<Q>&startq;te&s;timony of his real regard (as he &s;tyles it) for Mr. Hughes,&endq;</Q>
being given after his death, the editor of his Works was allowed by Mr. Pope to publi&s;h, as
<Q>&startq;a greater in&s;tance of the &s;incerity with which it was given.&endq;</Q>
Ibid. I. 205. The&s;e are his words. And now which is mo&s;t de&s;erving of credit, a te&s;ti|mony thus &s;olemnly given to the world, or the echo, as it were, of his peevi&s;h friend, whom he was afraid to contradict, in a letter which he little thought would have been pre&s;erved and printed; and which, with his others to Swift, he wanted to recall? At every tribunal, a witne&s;s who contradicts him|&s;elf is di&s;believed; if &s;uch an opinion is not allowed to e&s;ta|bli&s;h, much le&s;s &s;hould it be admitted to traduce a character: and, on the whole, the pa&s;&s;age which Dr. John&s;on has thus quoted can, with the con&s;iderate, only degrade and condemn the author of it, though
<Q>&startq;what HE wanted as an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> man, he made up as a genius.&endq;</Q>
I tran&s;cribe this pa&s;&s;age from a writer in "The Gentleman's Magazine, 1779," p. 457, who appears to be well informed. &mdash; Dr. John&s;on having ob|&s;erved that,
<Q>&startq;though Mr. Hughes's advances in literature are in the Biographia very o&s;tentatiou&s;ly di&s;played, the name of his ma&s;ter is &s;omewhat ungratefully concealed;&endq;</Q>
the Reviewer in "The Gentleman's Magazine, 1779," p. 549, exculpates Dr. Campbell by ob&s;erving,
<Q>&startq;that it does not appear, or is likely, that he knew it; and all that can be known is, that Hughes was a fellow-&s;tudent in logic and philo&s;ophy with Dr. Watts and Mr. Say, perhaps under Mr. Thomas Rowe.&endq;</Q>
&mdash; It mu&s;t be owned, however, that concealing a ma&s;ter's name is a venial fault. If it is always to be mentioned, how often mu&s;t the ma&s;ters of Eton and We&s;tmin&s;ter be named, though perhaps they have con|tributed little! A lad may leave &s;chool before he comes under them; or even if he does, all the five of &s;ix previous u&s;hers ought to have their proportionate &s;hare of prai&s;e. &mdash; An Ode, "To the Returning Sun," which I have printed in vol.

<HEAD>ODE TO KING WILLIAM, ON HIS SUCCESSES IN IRELAND.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ON QUEEN CAROLINE'S REBUILDING THE LODGINGS OF THE BLACK PRINCE, AND HENRY V. AT QUEEN'S COLLEGE, OXFORD.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. TICKELL <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Tickell, an Engli&s;h Poet of an excellent genius, was the &s;on of the Rev. Richard Tickell, a clergyman well-preferred in the North of England. Whil&s;t fellow of Queen's College, Oxford, he &s;o effectually made Mr. Addi&s;on his friend, by a complimentary copy of ver&s;es on "Ro&s;amond," that he obtained the office of under &s;ecretary of &s;tate; and, when Mr. Addi&s;on's ill health obliged him to re&s;ign, he &s;o effectually recommended Mr. Tickell to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Mr. Craggs, that he was continued in place till that gentleman's death. Mr. Tickell was appointed &s;ecretary to the lord ju&s;|tices in Ireland in June 1724, and held that office till his death in 1740. He had the care of an edition of Mr. Ad|di&s;on's works, to which he prefixed an account of his patron's life, and a poem on his death. The tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t book of the Iliad, which has been a&s;cribed to Tickell, was &s;aid to be in reality the production of Addi&s;on, to prejudice that which Pope had ju&s;t undertaken: a notion certainly without foundation. Mr. Watts, the printer, a&s;&s;ured a friend of mine, that
<Q>&startq;the tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t book of the Iliad&endq; was in Tickell's hand-writing, but much corrected "and interlined by Addi&s;on."</Q>
He publi&s;hed

<HEAD>ALMAHIDE, AN ODE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. HENRY ST. JOHN, AFTERWARDS LORD BOLINGBROKE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This truly extraordinary genius is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been born in 1672 (or rather not quite &s;o early). He was &s;ent to Eaton when ten years old, and thence to Chri&s;t-Church, Oxford; where he received the title of LL. D. Augu&s;t 27, 1702. He married his fir&s;t lady (Frances daughter of Sir H. Winchcomb of Bucklebury) in 1700; and took his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of commons for Wooton Ba&s;&s;et the &s;ame year. Having greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in that a&s;&s;embly, he was appointed &s;ecretary at war, April 20, 1704; and re|&s;igned Feb. 12, 1707-8. He &s;ucceeded Mr. Boyle, as &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate, Sept. 21, 1710: was created baron St. John and vi&s;count Bolingbroke, July 7, 1712; an honour which he received with much reluctance, having been di&s;ap|pointed of an earldom (extinct on the death of Paulet St. John, earl Bolingbroke, Oct. 5, 1711) and of the Garter; and was made lord lieutenant and cu&s;tos rotulorum of the county of E&s;&s;ex, Oct. 24, 1713. On the acce&s;&s;ion of King George, the &s;eals were taken from him, and all the papers in his office &s;ecured. Soon after the meeting of the new parliament, perceiving him&s;elf in danger, he withdrew into France. On his arrival at Paris, he received an invi|tation from the Pretender, to enter into his &s;ervice; which he declined, and endeavoured to &s;often his pro&s;ecution at home. Retiring to Dauphine, he continued there till July 1715, when he accepted a &s;econd offer of the &s;eals from the Pretender. Having been di&s;carded from the Chevalier's &s;ervice before that year was well expired, he &s;et to work in earne&s;t to make his peace at home; and procured a promi&s;e of pardon, on certain conditions, from the King; who, July 2, 1716, created his father baron of Batter&s;ea and vi&s;count St. John. In 1717, Lord Bolingbroke drew up a vindication of his whole conduct with re&s;pect to the Tories, in the form of a letter to Sir W. Wyndham, which is written with the utmo&s;t elegance and addre&s;s, and abounds with intere&s;ting and entertaining anecdotes. His Maje&s;ty having granted him a full and free pardon, May 28, 1723; he returned to his native country in June, at the very juncture when Bi&s;hop Atterbury was bani&s;hed. Obtaining an act of parliament, in May 1725, to re&s;tore him to his family inheritance, and to enable him to po&s;&s;e&s;s any purcha&s;e he &s;hould make, he pitched upon Dawley in Middle&s;ex; where he amu&s;ed him|&s;elf in rural employments, and in corre&s;ponding and con|ver&s;ing with a few &s;elect friends. He remained, however, &s;till a mere titular Lord, not being admitted to take his &s;eat in parliament. Inflamed with this taint, he again entered upon the public &s;tage, and embarked &s;trongly in oppo&s;ition again&s;t Sir Robert Walpole; which he carried on with ini|mitable &s;pirit, till, in 1735, on a di&s;agreement with his principal coadjutors, he retired to France, with a full re&s;o|lution never more to engage in public bu&s;ine&s;s. On the death of his father, at the age of ninety, in April 1742, he &s;ettled at Batter&s;ea, the ancient &s;eat of the family, where he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his days in the highe&s;t dignity; and died Dec. 15, 1751. During the latter part of his life, he was much in the confidence of Frederick Prince of Wales, father to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the ad|vi&s;er of the mo&s;t important &s;teps taken by that Prince in his political conduct. &mdash; Lord Bolingbroke's &s;econd lady was the dowager marchione&s;s de Vilett$, niece to madam de Main|tenon. His political character is fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the
<Q>&startq;Sup|plement to Swift.&endq;</Q>
&mdash;Mr. Walpole &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;With the mo&s;t agreeable talents in the world, and with great parts, Lord Bolingbroke was neither happy nor &s;ucce&s;sful. He wrote again&s;t the King, who had forgiven him; again&s;t Sir Ro|bert Walpole, who did forgive him; again&s;t the Pretender and the Clergy, who never will forgive him. He is one of our be&s;t Writers; though his attacks on all governments and all religion (neither of which he cared directly to ow$) have nece&s;&s;arily involved his &s;tyle in a want of per&s;picuity.&endq;</Q>

<HEAD>TO A LADY MORE CRUEL THAN FAIR.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. (AFTERWARDS SIR JOHN) VANBRUGH <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This excellent dramatic writer, de&s;cended from an antient family in Che$hire, di&s;covered an early propen&s;ion to poetry and architecture, and &s;oon became eminent in both. He &s;et out in life as an en&s;ign in the army; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a ready wit and an agreeable elocution. In &s;ome of his winter quarters he became acquainted with Sir Thomas Skipwith; who being a &s;harer in a theatrical patent, though little concerned in the conduct of it, young Vanbrugh &s;hewed him the outlines of two plays; and Sir Thomas encouraged him to fini&s;h
<Q>&startq;The Relap&s;e,&endq; which, being acted in 1697, &s;ucceeded beyond their warme&s;t expectations, placed Vanbrugh in a high degree of reputation, and &s;timulated him (under the patronage of lord Halifax) to complete his "Provoked Wife;" which was &s;ucce&s;sfully brought out at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1698.</Q>
Though both the&s;e comedies met with greater applau&s;e than the author expected, yet neither of them wanted enemies; and one of them is &s;aid to verify the ob&s;ervation of Pope,
<Q>"That Van wants grace, who never wanted wit."</Q>
In the &s;ame year, 1698, he brought out his comedy of "Ae&s;op," which was acted at Drury Lan$, and contains much general &s;atire and u&s;eful morality. [A pretty fable from this comedy may be &s;een in p. 344.]
<Q>&startq;The Fal&s;e Friend,&endq; his next comedy, came out in 1702.</Q>
During the reign of queen Anne, he received the honour of knighthood, and enjoyed for &s;ome years the office of Clarencieux king at arms. By king George I. he was appointed &s;urveyor of the works at Greenwich Ho&s;pital in Augu&s;t 1716; and was like|wi&s;e made comptroller-general of his maje&s;ty's works, and &s;urveyor of the gardens and waters. On a vi&s;it to France, his curio&s;ity and natural ta&s;te exciting him to take a &s;urvey of the fortifications in that kingdom, he was taken notice of by an engineer, &s;ecured by authority, and carried to The Ba&s;tile, where his confinement was &s;o much &s;oftened by humanity, that he amu&s;ed him&s;elf by drawing rude draughts of &s;ome co|medies. This circum&s;tance rai&s;ed &s;uch curio&s;ity at Paris, that he was vi&s;ited by &s;eve$ of the noble&s;&s;e, and by their means procured his liberty before any &s;olicitation for it came from England. Sir John Vanbrugh had intere&s;t enough to rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;cription of thirty per&s;ons of quality, at 100l. each, for building a &s;tately theatre in The Hay Market; on the fir&s;t &s;tone that was laid of this theatre was in&s;cribed the words LITTLE WHIG, as a compliment to a celebrated beauty, the toa&s;t and pride of that party. The hou&s;e being fini&s;hed in 1706, it was put by Mr. Betterton and his a&s;&s;ociates under the management of Sir John Vanbrugh and Mr. Congreve, in hopes of retrieving their de&s;perate fortunes; but their expec|tations were too &s;anguine. The new theatre was opened with a tran&s;lated opera, &s;et to Italian mu&s;ic, called
<Q>&startq;The Tri|umph of Love,&endq; which met with a cold reception.</Q>
<Q>&startq;The Confederacy&endq; was almo&s;t immediately after produced by Sir John, and acted with more &s;ucce&s;s than &s;o licentious a per|formance de&s;erved, though le&s;s than it was entitled to if con|&s;idered merely with re&s;pect to its dramatic merit.</Q>
The pro|&s;pects of the theatre being unpromi&s;ing, Mr. Congreve gave up his &s;hare and intere&s;t wholly to Vanbrugh; who, being now become &s;ole manager, was under a nece&s;&s;ity of exerting him&s;elf. Accordingly, in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, he gave the pub|lick three other imitations from the French; viz. 1.
<Q>&startq;The Cuckold in Conceit;&endq; 2. "Squire Trecloby;" and, 3. "The Mi&s;take."</Q>
The &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the dome in the new theatre, by preventing the actors from being di&s;tinctly heard, was an inconvenience not to be &s;urmounted; and an union of the two companies was projected. Sir John, tired of the bu&s;ine&s;s, di&s;po&s;ed of his theatrical concerns to Mr. Owen Swinney, who governed the &s;tage till another great revolution occurred. Our author's la&s;t comedy,
<Q>&startq;The Journey to London,&endq; which was left imperfect, was fini&s;hed to great advantage by Mr. Gibber; who takes notice in the prologue of Sir John's virtuous intention in compo&s;ing this piece, to make amends for &s;cenes written in the fire of youth.</Q>
He &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible indeed of this, when in 1725 he altered an exceptionable &s;cene in "The Provoked Wife," by putting into the mouth of a woman of quality what before had been &s;poken by a clergyman; a change which removed from him the imputation of prophanene&s;s. He died of a quin&s;ey, at his hou&s;e at Whitehall, March 26, 1726; and has left behind him monuments of &s;ame which can never peri&s;h but with ta&s;te and politene&s;s. He lived e&s;teemed by all his acquain|tance, and died without leaving one enemy to reproach his memory. Mr. Walpole, in his "Anecdotes of Painting," vol. III. p. 152, &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;However partial the court was to Vanbrugh, every body was not &s;o blind to his defects. Swift ridiculed both his own diminutive hou&s;e at Whitehall, and the &s;tupendous pile at Blenheim. Of the fir&s;t he &s;ays,
<Q><L>'At length they in the rubbi&s;h &s;py</L>
<L>'A thing re&s;embling a goo&s;e-pye.'</L></Q>
And of the other,
<Q><L>'That if his Grace were no more &s;kill'd in</L>
<L>'The art of battering walls than building,</L>
<L>'We might expect to &s;ee next year</L>
<L>'A mou&s;e-trap-man chief engineer.'</L></Q>
Thus far the <HI>&s;wi$&s;t</HI> was well <HI>found$d</HI>; party rage warped his under&s;tanding, when he cen&s;ured Vanbrugh's plays, and left him no more judgement to &s;ee their beauties, than Sir John had, when he perceived not that they were the only beauties he was formed to compo&s;e.&endq;</Q>
&mdash; This polite writer, perhaps, was not aware of the hand&s;ome apo|logy Dr. Swift and Mr. Pope have made, in the joint preface to their Mi&s;cellanies:
<Q>&startq;In regard to two per&s;ons only we with our raillery, though ever &s;o tender, or re&s;entment, though ever &s;o ju&s;t, had not been indulged. We &s;peak of Sir John Vanbrugh, who was a man of w$t, and of honour; and of Mr. Addi&s;on, who&s;e name de&s;erves all re&s;pect from every <HI>lo$er of learning</HI>.&endq;</Q>

(&s;on of a worthy clergyman in Hereford&s;hire, and great grand&s;on by his mo|ther's &s;ide to the famous Spen&s;er) was educated at Corpus Chri&s;ti College, Oxford; and was chaplain to the &s;econd duke of Richmond, and rector of Stopham in Su&s;&s;ex, near his Grace's &s;eat.&mdash;Be&s;ides the "Bibl$otheca," he was author of &s;everal poems of merit; particularly of
<Q>&startq;The la&s;t Judge|ment of Men and Angels, a poem in twelve books, after

<Q>&startq;To her late Maje&s;ty Queen Anne, upon the Peace of Utrecht;&endq;</Q>
"An Ode to the Memory of Mr. Rowe;" and another, "to the memory of the Counte&s;s of Berkeley." He al&s;o tran&s;lated &s;everal of Addi&s;on's Latin poems; and Philips's Ode to Mr. St. John, Engli&s;h Poets, vol. XXI. p. 29.</P>
<P>P. 44. It &s;ince appears that Mrs. Wharton (wife to Thomas Wharton, e&s;&abque; before he &s;ucceeded to a peerage) is the &s;ame who&s;e poems are printed in the&s;e volumes. Her article in the General Dictionary is a &s;hort one; but the notes on it contain two letters from her to her hu&s;band, and twelve from Dr. Burnet to Mrs. Wharton. The marquis's &s;econd wi&s;e had al&s;o poetical abilities, as will appear in vol. V. p. 10. A &s;mall epigram by the marquis is pre&s;erved in the Supple|ment to Swift.</P>

<P>P. 161. Dr. Evans 'on Ble$heim' reminds me of Lord Che&s;terfield telling Geo. Wade, after Lord Burlington had built him a hou&s;e in Burlington Gardens, with a mo&s;t elegant front, but very inconvenient within, that he did not make the proper u&s;e of it. 'How &s;o, my Lord?

<P>P. 65. Be&s;ides Dr. Brady's Sermon, I have now by me three others on St. Caecilia's day; one, by Ralph Battell, &s;ub-dean of their maje&s;ties chapel royal, 1693; Dr. Hick|man's in 1695; one by S. E&s;twick, B. D. in 1696, when the meeting was held on Nov. 27; Dr. Brady's was in 1697. Bound up with the&s;e is, a Sermon preached at Tiverton in Devon, by John Newton, M. A. rector of Tiverton; &s;ome time fellow of Baliol College, Oxford, Sept. 13, 1696, on occa&s;ion of an organ's being erected in the pari&s;h-church;

<P>P. 304. In the "Supplement to Swift's Works," I have taken &s;ome pains to collect &s;uch particulars of his life and character as had e&s;caped the notice of former editors; and am happy to find that my labours have been favourably ac|cepted. If they furni&s;h any new lights to future Biogra|phers, and particularly if they &s;ugge&s;t a &s;ingle hint to the bright luminary of Engli&s;h literature, I &s;hall receive my be&s;t
<PB N="358" REF="363">
reward.&mdash;One &s;triking anecdote, which has been communica|ted to me &s;ince that publication, is &s;o remarkable, that I &s;hall in&s;ert it here: it is extracted from a letter of Dr. Charles Da|venant, dated Sept. 22, to his &s;on Harry, &s;ecretary and charg&eacute; d'affairs for Q. Anne at Francfort.
<Q>&startq;I de&s;ire you to deliver the inclo&s;ed to Col. Parks (aid-de-camp to the Duke of Marlborough). The chief &s;ubject of it is to be|&s;peak his kindne&s;s for <HI>my cou&s;in Swift</HI> to be his chaplain again&s;t he has a regiment. My cou&s;in has gained immor|tal honour by <HI>having had the principal hand</HI> in a book lately publi&s;hed, called <HI>The Tale of a Tub</HI>, which has made as much noi&s;e, and is as full of wit, as any book, perhaps &endq;that has come out the&s;e la&s;t hundred years.</Q>
It needs not be added that the application was un&s;ucce&s;sful. To the duke of Marlborough, however, Swift (who without &s;cruple
<Q>&startq;li|&endq;belled the whole junto round) appears to have entertained no animo&s;ity.</Q>
The refu&s;al probably was noble; and Swift's conduct to the duke was equally liberal. He di&s;liked his principles; but
<Q>&startq;prevented many hard things being &s;aid of &endq;him.</Q>
And in the Journal to Stella, Jan. 8, 1711-12, it appears the duke de&s;ir$ $ $othing &s;o much as to contrive &s;ome way how to &s;often Dr. $ift; who &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;Tho&s;e things that were harde&s;t again&s;t him were not written by me. And I am &s;ure, now he is down, I &s;hall not trample on him: al|&endq;though I love him not, I di&s;like his being out.</Q></P>
<P>P. 320. Mr. Milbourne publi&s;hed 31 &s;ingle Sermons, be|tween 1682 and 1720.</P>
