<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
AND
PYRACIES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_AS it is u&s;ual for great Per&s;ons
who&s;e Lives have been remar|kable,
and who&s;e Actions de|&s;erve
Recording to Po&s;terity,
to in&s;i&s;t much upon their Ori|ginals,
give full Accounts of
their Families, and the Hi&s;to|ries
of their Ance&s;tors: So, that
I may be methodical, I &s;hall do the &s;ame, tho'
I can look but a very little Way into my Pe|digree
as you will &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>If I may believe the Woman, whom I was
taught to call Mother, I was a little Boy, of
about two Years old, very well dre&s;s'd, had a
Nur&s;ery Maid to tend me, who took me out
<PB N="2" REF="4">
on a fine Summer's Evening into the Fields to|wards
<HI>I&s;lington,</HI> as &s;he pretended, to give the
Child &s;ome Air, a little Girl being with her of
Twelve or Fourteen Years old, that lived in the
Neighbourhood. The Maid, whether by Ap|pointment
or otherwi&s;e, meets with a Fellow,
her Sweet-heart, as I &s;uppo&s;e; he carries her
into a Publick-Hou&s;e, to give her a Pot and a
Cake; and while they were toying in the Hou&s;e,
the Girl plays about with me in her Hand in
the Garden, and at the Door, &s;ometimes in Sight,
&s;ometimes out of Sight, thinking no Harm.</P>
<P>At this Juncture comes by one of tho&s;e Sort
of People, who, it &s;eems, made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s
to Spirit away little Children. This was a Hel|li&s;h
Trade in tho&s;e Days, and chiefly practi&s;ed
where they found little Children very well dre&s;t,
or for bigger Children, to &s;ell them to the
Plantations.</P>
<P>The Woman pretending to take me up in her
Arms and ki&s;s me, and play with me, draws
the Girl a good Way from the Hou&s;e, till at
la&s;t &s;he makes a fine Story to the Girl, and
bids her go back to the Maid, and tell her where
&s;he was with the Child; that a Gentlewoman
had taken a Fancy to the Child, and was ki&s;&s;ing
of it, but &s;he &s;hould not be frighted, or to that
Purpo&s;e; for they were but ju&s;t there; and &s;o
while the Girl went, &s;he carries me quite away.</P>
<P>From this time it &s;eems I was di&s;po&s;ed of to
a Beggar-Woman that wanted a pretty little
Child to &s;et out her Ca&s;e, and after that to
a Gyp&s;ey, under who&s;e Government I continued
till I was about Six Years old; and this Woman,
tho' I was continually dragged about with her,
from one Part of the Country to another, yet
<PB N="3" REF="5">
never let me want for any thing, and I called
her Mother; tho' &s;he told me at la&s;t, &s;he was
not my Mother, but that &s;he bought me for
Twelve Shillings of another Woman, who told
her how &s;he came by me, and told her that my
Name was <HI>Bob S$ngleton,</HI> not <HI>Robert,</HI> but plain <HI>Bob;</HI>
for it &s;eems they never knew by what Name I
was Chri&s;ten'd.</P>
<P>It is in vain to reflect here, what a terrible
Fright the carele&s;s Hu&s;&s;y was in, that lo&s;t me;
what Treatment &s;he received from my ju&s;tly
enraged Father and Mother, and the Horror
the&s;e mu&s;t be in at the Thoughts of their Child
being thus carry'd away; for as I never knew
any thing of the Matter, but ju&s;t what I have
related, nor who my Father and Mother were;
&s;o it would make but a needle&s;s Digre&s;&s;ion to talk
of it here.</P>
<P>My good <HI>Gyp&s;ey Mother,</HI> for &s;ome of her wor|thy
Actions <HI>no doubt,</HI> happened in Proce&s;s of Time
to be hang'd; and as this fell out &s;omething too
&s;oon for me to be perfected in the Strolling
Trade, the Pari&s;h where I was left, which for my
Life I can't remember, took &s;ome Care of me to
be &s;ure; for the fir&s;t thing I can remember of my
&s;elf afterwards, was, that I went to a Pari&s;h-School,
and the Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h u&s;ed to
talk to me to be a good Boy; and that tho' I was
but a poor Boy, if I minded my Book, and &s;er|ved
God, I might make a good Man.</P>
<P>I believe I was frequently removed from one
Town to another, perhaps as the Pari&s;hes di&s;pu|ted
my &s;uppo&s;ed Mother's la&s;t Settlement. Whe|ther
I was &s;o &s;hifted by Pa&s;&s;es, or otherwi&s;e, I
know not; but the Town where I la&s;t was kept,
whatever its Name was, mu&s;t be not far off from
<PB N="4" REF="6">
the Sea Side; for a Ma&s;ter of a Ship who took
a Fancy to me, was the fir&s;t that brought me
to a Place not far from <HI>Southampton,</HI> which I af|terwards
knew to be <HI>Bu&s;&s;elton,</HI> and there I tended
the Carpenters, and &s;uch People as were em|ploy'd
in Building a Ship for him; and when it
was done, tho' I was not above Twelve Years
old, he carried me to Sea with him, on a Voyage
to <HI>Newfoundland.</HI></P>
<P>I lived well enough, and plea&s;ed my Ma&s;ter
&s;o well, that he called me his own Boy; and I
would have called him Father, but he would not
allow it, for he had Children of his own. I went
three or four Voyages with him, and grew a great
&s;turdy Boy, when coming Home again from the
Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> we were taken by an <HI>Al|gerine</HI>
Rover, or Man of War; which, if my Ac|count
&s;tands right, was about the Year 1695,
for you may be &s;ure I kept no Journal.</P>
<P>I was not much concerned at the Di&s;a&s;ter, tho'
I &s;aw my Ma&s;ter, after having been wounded by a
Splinter in the Head during the Engagement, ve|ry
barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed by the <HI>Turks; I &s;ay,</HI> I was
not much concerned, till upon &s;ome unlucky
thing I &s;aid, which, as I remember, was about
abu&s;ing my Ma&s;ter, they took me and beat me
mo&s;t unmercifully with a flat Stick on the Soles
of my Feet, &s;o that I could neither go or &s;tand
for &s;everal Days together.</P>
<P>But my good Fortune was my Friend upon
this Occa&s;ion; for as they were &s;ailing away
with our Ship in Tow as a Prize, &s;teering
for the Streights, and in Sight of the Bay of
<HI>Cadiz,</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Rover was attack'd by two
great <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Men of War, and taken and car|ried
into <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
As I was not much concerned at my Captivity,
not indeed under&s;tanding the Con&s;equences of it,
if it had continued; &s;o I was not &s;uitably &s;en&s;ible
of my Deliverance: Nor indeed was it &s;o much
a Deliverance to me, as it would otherwi&s;e ha'
been; for my Ma&s;ter, who was the only Friend I
had in the World, died at <HI>Lisbon</HI> of his Wounds;
and I being then almo&s;t reduced to my primitive
State, <HI>viz.</HI> of Starving, had this Addition to it,
that it was in a foreign Country too, where I
knew no body, and could not &s;peak a Word of
their Language. However, I fared better here
than I had Rea&s;on to expect; for when all the re&s;t
of our Men had their Liberty to go where they
would, I that knew not whither to go, &s;taid in
the Ship for &s;everal Days, till at length one of
the Lieutenants &s;eeing me, enquired what that
young <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dog did there, and why they did
not turn him on Shore?</P>
<P>I heard him, and partly under&s;tood what he
meant, tho' not what he &s;aid, and began then to
be in a terrible Fright; for I knew not where to
get a Bit of Bread; when the Pilot of the Ship,
an old Seaman, &s;eeing me look very dull, came to
me, and &s;peaking broken <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to me, told me,
I mu&s;t be gone. Whither mu&s;t I go (&s;aid I?)
Where you will, (&s;aid he), Home to your own
Country, if you will. How mu&s;t I go thither
(&s;aid I?) Why have you no Friend (&s;aid he?)
No, (&s;aid I) not in the World, but that Dog,
pointing to the Ship's Dog, (who having &s;tole
a Piece of Meat ju&s;t before, had brought it clo&s;e
by me, and I had taken it from him, and eat
it) for he has been a good Friend, and brought
me my Dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
<HI>Well, well,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>you must have your Dinner;
Will you go with me? Yes,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>with all my Heart.</HI>
In &s;hort, the old Pilot took me Home with him,
and u&s;ed me tolerably well, tho' I fared hard
enough, and I lived with him about two Years,
during which time he was &s;olliciting his Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and at length got to be Ma&s;ter or Pilot under
<HI>D$n Garcia de Pimente&s;ia de Carravallas,</HI> Captain of
a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Gallion, or Carrack, which was bound
to <HI>Goa</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and immediately ha|ving
gotten his Commi&s;&s;ion, put me on Board
to look after his Cabbin, in which he had &s;to|red
him&s;elf with Abundance of Liquors, Suc|cades,
Sugar, Spices, and other things for his
Accommodation in the Voyage, and laid in af|terwards
a con&s;iderable Quantity of <HI>European</HI>
Goods, fine Lace, and Linnen; and al&s;o Bays,
Woollen, Cloath, Stuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under the Pretence
of his Clothes.</P>
<P>I was too young in the Trade to keep any
Journal of this Voyage, tho' my Ma&s;ter, who
was for a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> a pretty good Arti&s;t, prompted
me to it: But my not under&s;tanding the Lan|guage,
was one Hindrance; at lea&s;t, it &s;erved
me for an Excu&s;e. However, after &s;ome time
I began to look into his Charts and Books; and
as I could write a tolerable Hand, under&s;tood
&s;ome <HI>Latin,</HI> and began to have a Smattering of
the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Tongue; &s;o I began to get a little
&s;uperficial Knowledge of Navigation, but not
&s;uch as was likely to be &s;ufficient to carry me
thro' a Life of Adventure, as mine was to be.
<HI>In &s;hort,</HI> I learnt &s;everal material Things in this
Voyage among the <HI>Portugue&s;e:</HI> I learnt particu|larly
to be an errant Thief and a bad Sailor;
and I think I may &s;ay they are the be&s;t Ma|&s;ters
<PB N="7" REF="9">
for Teaching both the&s;e, of any Nation in
the World.</P>
<P>We made our Way for the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> by the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il;</HI> not that it is in the Cour&s;e of
Sailing the Way thither; but our Captain, ei|ther
on his own Account, or by the Direction of the
Merchants, went thither fir&s;t, where at <HI>All Saints
Bay,</HI> or as they call it in <HI>Portugal,</HI> the <HI>Rio de Todos
los Santos,</HI> we delivered near an Hundred Ton of
Goods, and took in a con&s;iderable Quantity of
Gold, with &s;ome Che&s;ts of Sugar, and Seventy
or Eighty great Rolls of Tobacco, every Roll
weighing at lea&s;t 100 Weight.</P>
<P>Here being lodged on Shore by my Ma&s;ter's
Order, I had the Charge of the Captain's Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
he having &s;een me very diligent for my
own Ma&s;ter; and in Requital for his mi&s;taken
Confidence, I found Means to &s;ecure, that is to
&s;ay, to &s;teal about twenty Moydores out of the
Gold that was Shipt on Board by the Merchants,
and this was my fir&s;t Adventure.</P>
<P>We had a tolerable Voyage from hence to
the Cape <HI>de bona Speranza;</HI> and I was reputed
as a mighty diligent Servant to my Ma&s;ter,
and very faithful (I was diligent indeed,
but I was very far from hone&s;t; however,
they thought me hone&s;t, which by the Way,
was their very great Mi&s;take) upon this very
Mi&s;take, the Captain took a particular Li|king
to me, and employ'd me frequently on
his own Occa&s;ions; and on the other Hand, in
Recompence for my Officious Diligence, I re|ceived
&s;everal particular Favours from him;
particularly, I was by the Captain's Command,
made a kind of a Steward under the Ship's
Steward, for &s;uch Provi&s;ions as the Captain de|manded
<PB N="8" REF="10">
for his own Table. He had another
Steward for his private Stores be&s;ides, but my
Office concerned only what the Captain called
for of the Ship's Stores, for his private
U&s;e.</P>
<P>However, by this Means I had Opportunity
particularly to take Care of my Ma&s;ter's Man,
and to furni&s;h my &s;elf with &s;ufficient Provi&s;ions
to make me live much better than the other
People in the Ship; for the Captain &s;eldom or|dered
any thing out of the Ship's Stores, as
above, but I &s;nipt &s;ome of it for my own Share.
We arrived at <HI>Goa</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> in about &s;e|ven
Months, from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and remained there
eight more; during which Time I had indeed
nothing to do, my Ma&s;ter being generally on
Shore, but to learn every thing that is wicked
among the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> a Nation the mo&s;t per&s;i|dious
and the mo&s;t debauch'd, the mo&s;t in&s;olent
and cruel, of any that pretend to call them|&s;elves
Chri&s;tians, in the World.</P>
<P>Thieving, Lying, Swearing, For&s;wearing,
joined to the mo&s;t abominable Lewdne&s;s, was
the &s;tated Practice of the Ship's Crew; <HI>adding
to it,</HI> that with the mo&s;t un&s;ufferable Boa&s;ts of
their new Courage, they were generally &s;peaking
the mo&s;t compleat Cowards that I ever met with;
and the Con&s;equence of their Cowardice was
evident upon many Ccca&s;ions. However, there
was here and there one among them that
was not &s;o bad as the re&s;t; and as my Lot fell
among them, it made me have the mo&s;t con|temptible
Thoughts of the re&s;t, as indeed they
de&s;erved.</P>
<P>I was exactly fitted for their Society indeed;
for I had no Sen&s;e of Virtue or Religion upon
<PB N="9" REF="11">
me. I had never heard much of either, except
what a good old Par&s;on had &s;aid to me when I
was a Child of about Eight or Nine Years old;
nay, I was preparing, and growing up apace,
to be as wicked as any Body could be, or per|haps
ever was. Fate certainly thus directed my
Beginning, knowing that I had Work which I
had to do in the World, which nothing but one
hardened again&s;t all Sen&s;e of Hone&s;ty or Reli|gion,
could go thro'; and yet even in this State
of Original Wickedne&s;s, I entertained &s;uch a
&s;ettled Abhorrence of the abandon'd Vilene&s;s of
the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> that I could not but hate them
mo&s;t heartily from the Beginning, and all my Life
afterwards. They were &s;o bruti&s;hly wicked, &s;o
ba&s;e and per&s;idious, not only to Strangers, but
to one another; &s;o meanly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive when &s;ub|jected;
&s;o in&s;olent, or barbarous and tyrannical
when &s;uperiour, that I thought there was &s;ome|thing
in them that &s;hock'd my very Nature.
Add to this, that 'tis natural to an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>
to hate a Coward, it all joined together to make
the Devil and a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> equally my Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>However, according to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb,
<HI>He that is Shipp'd with the Devil must &s;ail with the
Devil;</HI> I was among them, and I manag'd my
&s;elf as well as I could. My Ma&s;ter had con|&s;ented
that I &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the Captain in the
Office as above; but as I under&s;tood afterwards,
that the Captain allowed my Ma&s;ter Half a
Moydore a Month for my Service, and that
he had my Name upon the Ship's Books al&s;o,
I expected that when the Ship came to be paid
four Months Wages at the <HI>Indies,</HI> as they it &s;eems
always do, my Ma&s;ter would let me have &s;ome|ting
for my &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">
But I was wrong in my Man, for he was
none of that Kind: He had taken me up as in
Di&s;tre&s;s, and his Bu&s;ine&s;s was to keep me &s;o,
and make his Market of me as well as he could;
which I began to think of after a different
Manner than I did at fir&s;t; for at fir&s;t I thought
he had entertained me in meer Charity, upon
&s;eeing my di&s;tre&s;t Circum&s;tances, but did not
doubt, but when he put me on Board the Ship,
I &s;hould have &s;ome Wages for my Service.</P>
<P>But he thought, it &s;eems, quite otherwi&s;e; and
when I procured one to &s;peak to him about it
when the Ship was paid at <HI>Goa,</HI> he flew into the
greate&s;t Rage imaginable, and called me <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Dog, young Heretick, and threaten'd to put
me into the Inqui&s;ition. Indeed of all the Names
the Four and Twenty Letters could make up,
he &s;hould not have called me Heretick; for as
I knew nothing about Religion, neither <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI>
from <HI>Papist,</HI> or either of them from a <HI>Mahome|tan,</HI>
I could never be a Heretick. However, it
pa&s;s'd but a little, but as young as I was, I had
been carried into the Inqui&s;ition; and there, if
they had ask'd me, if I was a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> or a <HI>Catho|lick,</HI>
I &s;hould have &s;aid Yes to that which came
fir&s;t. If it had been the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> they had ask'd
fir&s;t, it had certainly made a Martyr of me for
I did not know what.</P>
<P>But the very Prie&s;t they carried with them, or
Chaplain of the Ship, as we call him, &s;aved me;
for &s;eeing me a Boy entirely ignorant of Religion,
and ready to do or &s;ay any thing they bid me,
he ask'd me &s;ome Que&s;tions about it, which he
found I an&s;wered &s;o very &s;imply, that he took it
upon him to tell them, he would an&s;wer for my
being a good Catholick; and he hoped he &s;hould
<PB N="11" REF="13">
be the Means of &s;aving my Soul; and he plea&s;ed
him&s;elf, that it was to be a Work of Merit to
him; &s;o he made me as good a <HI>Papist</HI> as any of
them in about a Week's Time.</P>
<P>I then told him my Ca&s;e about my Ma&s;ter
how, it is true, he had taken me up in a mi&s;e|rable
Ca&s;e, on Board a Man of War at <HI>Lisbon;</HI>
and I was indebted to him for bringing me on
Board this Ship; that if I had been left at
<HI>Lisbon,</HI> I might have &s;tarv'd, and the like: And
therefore I was willing to &s;erve him; but that I
hop'd he would give me &s;ome little Con&s;idera|tion
for my Service, or let me know how long
he expected I &s;hould &s;erve him for nothing.</P>
<P>It was all one; neither the Prie&s;t or any one
el&s;e could prevail with him, but that I was not
his Servant but his Slave; that he took me in
the <HI>Algerine;</HI> and that I was a <HI>Turk,</HI> only preten|ded
to be an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Boy, to get my Liberty, and
he would carry me to the Inqui&s;ition as a <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>This frighted me out of my Wits; for I had no
body to vouch for me what I was, or from whence
I came; but the good <HI>Padre Antonio,</HI> for that was
his Name, cleared me of that Part by a Way I
did not under&s;tand: For he came to me one
Morning with two Sailors, and told me they
mu&s;t &s;earch me, to bear Witne&s;s that I was not
a <HI>Turk.</HI> I was amazed at them, and frighted; and
did not under&s;tand them; nor could I imagine
what they intended to do to me. However,
&s;tripping me, they were &s;oon &s;atisfy'd; and Fa|ther
<HI>Anthony</HI> bad me be ea&s;y, for they could all
Witne&s;s that I was no <HI>Turk.</HI> So I e&s;caped that
Part of my Ma&s;ter's Cruelty.</P>
<P>And now I re&s;olved from that time to run
away from him if I could; but there was no
<PB N="12" REF="14">
doing of it there; for there were not Ships of
any Nation in the World in that Port, except
two or three <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>Ormus;</HI> &s;o that
if I had offer'd to go away from him, he would
have had me &s;eized on Shore, and brought on
Board by Force. So that I had no Remedy but
Patience, and this he brought to an End too
as &s;oon as he could; for after this he began to
u&s;e me ill, and not only to &s;traiten my Provi&s;i|ons,
but to beat and torture me in a barbarous
Manner for every Trifle; &s;o that in a Word my
Life began to be very mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>The Violence of this U&s;age of me, and the
Impo&s;&s;ibility of my E&s;cape from his Hands, &s;et
my Head a-working upon all Sorts of Mi&s;chief;
and in particular, I re&s;olved, after &s;tudying all
other Ways to deliver my &s;elf, and finding all
ineffectual; I &s;ay, I re&s;olved to murther him.
With this Helli&s;h Re&s;olution in my Head, I &s;pent
whole Nights and Days contriving how to put it
in Execution, the Devil prompting me very
warmly to the Fact. I was indeed entirely at a
Lo&s;s for the Means; for I had neither Gun or
Sword, nor any Weapon to a&s;&s;ault him with.
Poi&s;on I had my Thoughts much upon, but knew
not where to get any; or if I might have got
it, I did not know the Country Word for it, or
by what Name to ask for it.</P>
<P>In this Manner I quitted the Fact intentio|nally
a Hundred and a Hundred Times; but
Providence, either for his &s;ake, or for mine, al|ways
fru&s;trated my De&s;igns, and I could never
bring it to pa&s;s; &s;o I was obliged to continue
in his Chains till the Ship, having taken in her
Loading, &s;et Sail for <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
I can &s;ay nothing here to the Manner of our
Voyage; for as I &s;aid, I kept no Journal; but
this I can give an Account of, that having been
once as high as the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> as we call
it; or <HI>Cabo de bona Speranza,</HI> as they call it, we
were driven back again by a violent Storm from
the W. S. W. which held us &s;ix Days and
Nights, a great Way to the Ea&s;tward; and after
that &s;tanding afore the Wind for &s;everal Days
more, we at la&s;t came to an Anchor on the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI></P>
<P>The Storm had been &s;o violent, that the Ship
had received a great deal of Damage, and it
required &s;ome time to repair her; &s;o &s;tanding
in nearer the Shore, the Pilot, <HI>My Ma&s;ter,</HI>
brought the Ship into a very good Harbour,
where we rid in Twenty &s;ix Fathom Water,
about Half a Mile from the Shore.</P>
<P>While the Ship rode here, there happen'd a
mo&s;t de&s;perate Mutiny among the Men, upon
Account of &s;ome Deficiency in their Allowance,
which came to that Height, that they threaten'd
the Captain to &s;et him on Shore, and go back
with the Ship to <HI>Goa.</HI> I wi&s;h'd they would, with
all my Heart, for I was full of Mi&s;chief in my
Head, and ready enough to do any. So, tho'
I was but a Boy, as they called me, yet I prom|pted
the Mi&s;chief all I could, and embarked in
it &s;o openly, that I e&s;cap'd very little being
hang'd in the fir&s;t and mo&s;t early Part of my
Life; for the Captain had &s;ome Notice, that
there was a De&s;ign laid by &s;ome of the Com|pany
to murther him; and having partly by
Money and Promi&s;es, and partly by Threatning
and Torture, brought two Fellows to confe&s;s the
Particulars, and the Names of the Per&s;ons con|cerned,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
they were pre&s;ently apprehended, till one
accu&s;ing another, no le&s;s than &s;ixteen Men were
&s;eized, and put into Irons, whereof I was one.</P>
<P>The Captain, who was made de&s;perate by his
Danger, re&s;olving to clear the Ship of his Ene|mies,
try'd us all, and we were all condemned
to die. The Manner of his Proce&s;s I was too
young to take Notice of; but the Pur&s;er and
one of the Gunners were hang'd immediately,
and I expected it with the re&s;t. I do not remem|ber
any great Concern I was under about it, on|ly
that I cry'd very much; for I knew little
then of this World, and nothing at all of the
next.</P>
<P>However, the Captain contented him&s;elf with
executing the&s;e two; and &s;ome of the re&s;t, up|on
their hmble Submi&s;&s;ion, and Promi&s;e of fu|ture
good Behaviour, were pardoned; but five
were ordered to be &s;et on Shore on the I&s;land,
and left there, of which I was one. My Ma&s;ter
u&s;ed all his Intere&s;t with the Captain to have
me excu&s;ed, but could not obtain it; for &s;ome|body
having told him that I was one of them,
who was &s;ingled out to have killed him, when
my Ma&s;ter de&s;ired I might not be &s;et on Shore,
the Captain told him, I &s;hould &s;tay on Board
if he de&s;ired it, but then I &s;hould be hang'd;
&s;o he might chu&s;e for me which he thought
be&s;t: The Captain, it &s;eems, was particular|ly
provok'd at my being concerned in the Trea|chery,
becau&s;e of his having been &s;o kind to me,
and of his having &s;ingled me me out to &s;erve him,
as I have &s;aid above; and this perhaps obliged
him to give my Ma&s;ter &s;uch a rough Choice,
either to &s;et me on Shore, or to have me hang'd
on Board: And had my Ma&s;ter indeed known
<PB N="15" REF="17">
what good Will I had for him, he would not
ha' been long in chu&s;ing for me; for I had cer|tainly
determined to do him a Mi&s;chief the
fir&s;t Opportunity I had had for it. This was
therefore a good Providence for me, to keep
me from dipping my Hands in Blood, and it
made me more tender afterwards in Matters of
Blood, than I believe I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have
been. But as to my being one of them that was
to kill the Captain, that I was wrong'd in, for I
was not the Per&s;on; but it was really one of them
that were pardoned, he having the good Luck
not to have that Part di&s;covered.</P>
<P>I was now to enter upon a Part of indepen|dent
Life, a thing I was indeed very ill prepared
to manage; for I was perfectly loo&s;e and di&s;&s;olute
in my Behaviour, bold and wicked while I was
under Government, and now perfectly unfit to be
tru&s;ted with Liberty; for I was as ripe for any
Villainy, as a young Fellow that had no &s;olid
Thought ever placed in his Mind could be &s;uppo|&s;ed
to be. Education, as you have heard, I had
none; and all the little Scenes of Life I had
pa&s;s'd thro', had been full of Dangers and de|&s;perate
Circum&s;tances; but I was either &s;o
young, or &s;o &s;tupid, that I e&s;caped the Grief and
Anxiety of them, for want of having a Sen&s;e of
their Tendency and Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>This thoughtle&s;s, unconcern'd Temper had
one Felicity indeed in it; that it made me daring
and ready for doing any Mi&s;chief, and kept off
the Sorrow which otherwi&s;e ought to have atten|ded
me when I fell into any Mi&s;chief; that this
Stupidity was in&s;tead of a Happine&s;s to me, for
it left my Thoughts free to act upon Means of
E&s;cape and Deliverance in my Di&s;tre&s;s, how|ever
<PB N="16" REF="18">
great it might be; whereas my Compani|ons
in the Mi&s;ery, were &s;o &s;unk by their Fear
and Grief, that they abandoned them&s;elves to
the Mi&s;ery of their Condition, and gave over all
Thought but of their peri&s;hing and &s;tarving,
being devoured by wild Bea&s;ts, murthered, and
perhaps eaten by <HI>Cannibals, and the like.</HI></P>
<P>I was but a young Fellow about 17 or 18;
but hearing what was to be my Fate, I received it
with no Appearance of Di&s;couragement; but I
asked what my Ma&s;ter &s;aid to it, and being told
that he had u&s;ed his utmo&s;t Intere&s;t to &s;ave me,
but the Captain had an&s;wered I &s;hould either
go on Shore or be hanged on Board, which he
plea&s;ed; I then gave over all Hope of being re|ceived
again: I was not very thankful in my
Thoughts to my Ma&s;ter for his &s;olliciting the
Captain for me, becau&s;e I knew that what he did
was not in Kindne&s;s to me, &s;o much as in Kind|ne&s;s
to him&s;elf; I mean to pre&s;erve the Wages
which he got for me, which amounted to above
&s;ix Dollars a Month, including what the Cap|tain
allowed him for my particular Service
to him.</P>
<P>When I under&s;tood that my Ma&s;ter was &s;o
apparently kind, I asked if I might not be ad|mitted
to &s;peak with him, and they told
me I might, if my Ma&s;ter would come down to
me, but I could not be allowed to come up to
him; &s;o then I de&s;ired my Ma&s;ter might be
&s;poke to to come to me, and he accordingly
came to me; I fell on my Knees to him, and
begg'd he would forgive me what I had done to
di&s;plea&s;e him; and indeed the Re&s;olution I had
taken to murther him, lay with &s;ome Horrour
upon my Mind ju&s;t at that Time, &s;o that I was
<PB N="17" REF="19">
once ju&s;t a-going to confe&s;s it, and beg him to
forgive me, but I kept it in: He told me he had
done all he could to obtain my Pardon of the
Captain, but could not; and he knew no Way
for me but to have Patience, and &s;ubmit to my
Fate; and if they came to &s;peak with any Ship
of their Nation at the Cape, he would endea|vour
to have them &s;tand in, and fetch us off
again if we might be found.</P>
<P>Then I begg'd I might have my Clothes on
Shore with me. He told me he was afraid I
&s;hould have little Need of Clothes, for he did
not &s;ee how we could long &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the I&s;land,
and that he had been told that the Inhabitants
were <HI>Cannibals</HI> or <HI>Men-eaters</HI> (tho' he had no Rea|&s;on
for that Sugge&s;tion) and we &s;hould not be
able to live among them. I told him I was not
&s;o afraid of that, as I was of &s;tarving for want
of Victuals; and as for the Inhabitants being
<HI>Cannibals,</HI> I believed we &s;hould be more likely
to eat them, than they us, if we could but get
at them: But I was mightily concerned, I &s;aid,
we &s;hould have no Weapons with us to defend
our &s;elves, and I begg'd nothing now, but that he
would give me a Gun and a Sword, with a little
Powder and Shot.</P>
<P>He &s;miled and &s;aid, they would &s;ignify no|thing
to us, for it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to pretend
to pre&s;erate our Lives among &s;uch a populous
and de&s;perate Nation as the People of the I&s;land
were. I told him, that however it would do
us this Good, for we &s;hould not be devoured or
de&s;troy'd immediately;&s;o I begged hard for the
Gun. At la&s;t he told me, he did not know whe|ther
the Captain would give him Leave to give
me a Gun, and if not, he dur&s;t not do it; but
<PB N="18" REF="20">
he promi&s;ed to u&s;e his Intere&s;t to obtain it forme,
which he did, and the next Day he &s;ent me a Gun,
with &s;ome Ammunition, but told me, the Cap|tain
would not &s;uffer the Ammunition to be given
us, till we were &s;et all on Shore, and till he was ju&s;t
going to &s;et Sail. He al&s;o &s;ent me the few
Clothes I had in the Ship, which indeed were
not many.</P>
<P>Two Days after this we were all carried on
Shore together; the re&s;t of my Fellow-Criminals
hearing I had a Gun, and &s;ome Powder and Shot,
&s;ollicited for Liberty to carry the like with them,
which was al&s;o granted them; and thus we were
&s;et on Shore to &s;hift for our &s;elves.</P>
<P>At our fir&s;t coming into the I&s;land, we were
terrified exceedingly with the Sight of the bar|barous
People; who&s;e Figure was made more
terrible to us than really it was, by the Report
we had of them from the Seamen; but when we
came to conver&s;e with them a while, we found
they were not <HI>Cannibals,</HI> as was reported, or
&s;uch as would fall immediately upon us and eat
us up; but they came and &s;at down by us, and
wondered much at our Clothes and Arms, and
made Signs to give us &s;ome Victuals, &s;uch as
they had, which was only Roots and Plants dug
out of the Ground, for the pre&s;ent, but they
brought us Fowls and Fle&s;h afterwards in good
Plenty.</P>
<P>This encouraged the other four Men that
were with me very much, for they were quite
dejected before; but now they began to be very fa|miliar
with them, and made Signs, that if they
would u&s;e us kindly, we would &s;tay and live
with them; which they &s;eemed glad of, tho'
they knew little of the Nece&s;&s;ity we were under
<PB N="19" REF="21">
to do &s;o, or how much we were afraid of
them.</P>
<P>However, upon other Thoughts, we re&s;olved
that we would only &s;tay in that Part &s;o long
as the Ship rid in the Bay, and then making
them believe we were gone with the Ship, we
would go and place our &s;elves, if po&s;&s;ible, where
there were no Inhabitants to be &s;een, and &s;o
live as we could, or perhaps watch for a Ship
that might be driven upon the Coa&s;t, as we were.</P>
<P>The Ship continued a Fortnight in the Road
repairing &s;ome Damage which had been done
her in the late Storm, and taking in Wood and
Water; and during this time the Boat comning
often on Shore, the Men brought us &s;everal
Refre&s;hments, and the Natives believing we only
belong'd to the Ship, were civil enough. We
lived in a kind of a Tent on the Shore, or rather
a Hut, which we made with the Boughs of
Trees, and &s;ometimes in the Night retired
to a Wood a little out of their Way, to let them
think we were gone on board the Ship. How|ever,
we found them barbarous, treacherous,
and villainous enough in their Nature, only civil
for Fear, and therefore concluded we &s;hould &s;oon
fall into their Hands when the Ship was gone.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;e of this wrought upon my Fellow-Sufferers
even to Di&s;traction; and one of them,
being a Carpenter, in his mad Fit, &s;wan off
to the Ship in the Night, tho' &s;he lay then a
League to Sea, and made &s;uch pitiful Moan to
be taken in, that the Captain was prevailed
with at la&s;t to take him in, tho' they let him
lye &s;wimming three Hours in the Water before
he con&s;ented to it.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
Upon this, and his humble Submi&s;&s;ion, the Cap|tain
received him, and, in a word, the Importu|nity
of this Man (who for &s;ome time petition'd
to be taken in, tho' they hanged him as &s;oon as
they had him) was &s;uch as could not be re&s;i&s;ted;
for, after he had &s;wam &s;o long about the Ship,
he was not able to have reached the Shore again;
and the Captain &s;aw evidently that the Man
mu&s;t be taken on Board, or &s;uffered to drown,
and the whole Ship's Company offering to be
bound for him for his good Behaviour, the Cap|tain
at la&s;t yielded, and he was taken up, but
almo&s;t dead with his being &s;o long in the
Water.</P>
<P>When this Man was got in, he never left Im|portuning
the Captain and all the re&s;t of the
Officers in Behalf of us that were behind,
but to the very la&s;t Day the Captain was in|exorable;
when, at the time their Preparations
were making to &s;ail, and Orders given to hoi&s;t
the Boats into the Ship, all the Seamen in a Body
came up to the Rail of the Quarter-Deck, where
the Captain was walking with &s;ome of his Of|ficers,
and appointing the Boat&s;wain to &s;peak
for them, he went up, and falling on his Knees
to the Captain, begged of him in the humble&s;t
manner po&s;&s;ible, to receive the four Men on
Board again, offering to an&s;wer for their Fide|lity,
or to have them kept in Chains till they
came to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and there to be delivered up
to Ju&s;tice, rather than, as they &s;aid, to have
them left to be murthered by Savages, or de|voured
by wild Bea&s;ts. It was a great while e'er
the Captain took any Notice of them, but when he
did he ordered the Boat&s;wain to be &s;eized, and
<PB N="21" REF="23">
threatned to bring him to the Cap&s;tern for
&s;peaking for them.</P>
<P>Upon this Severity, one of the Seamen, bolder
than the re&s;t, but &s;till with all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect
to the Captain, be&s;ought his Honour, as he cal|led
him, that he would give Leave to &s;ome more
of them to go on Shore, and die with their
Companions, or, if po&s;&s;ible, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them to
re&s;i&s;t the Barbarians. The Captain, rather pro|voked
than cowd with this, came to the Barricado
of the Quarter-Deck, and &s;peaking very prudent|ly
to the Men, (for, had he &s;poken roughly,
two Thirds of them would have left the Ship,
if not all of them) he told them, it was for their
Safety as well as his own, that he had been obli|ged
to that Severity; that Mutiny on board a
Ship was the &s;ame thing as Trea&s;on in the King's
Palace, and he could not an&s;wer it to his Owners
and Employers to tru&s;t the Ship and Goods Com|mitted
to his Charge, with Men who had enter|tained
Thoughts of the wor&s;t and blacke&s;t Na|ture;
that he wi&s;hed heartily that it had been
any where el&s;e that they had been &s;et on Shore,
where they might have been in le&s;s Hazard
from the Savages; that if he had de&s;igned they
&s;hould be de&s;troyed, he-could as well have exe|cuted
them on board as the other two; that he
wi&s;hed it had been in &s;ome other Part of the
World, where he might have delivered them
up to the Civil Ju&s;tice, or might have left them
among Chri&s;tians; but that it was better their
Lives were put in Hazard, than his Life, and the
Safety of the Ship; and that tho' he did not
know that he had de&s;erved &s;o ill of any of them,
as that they &s;hould leave the Ship, rather than
do their Duty; yet if any of them were re&s;olved
<PB N="22" REF="24">
to do &s;o unle&s;s he would con&s;ent to take a Gang of
Traytors on board, who, as he had proved be|fore
them all, had con&s;pired to murther him,
he would not hinder them, nor, for the pre&s;ent,
would he re&s;ent their Importunity; but if there
was no body left in the Ship but himfelf, he
would never con&s;ent to take them on board.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e was delivered &s;o well, was in
it &s;elf &s;o rea&s;onable, was managed with &s;o much
Temper, yet &s;o boldly concluded with a Nega|tive,
that the greate&s;t Part of the Men were &s;a|ti&s;fied
for the pre&s;ent: However, as it put the
Men into Juncto's and Cabals, and they were not
compo&s;ed for &s;ome Hours; the Wind al&s;o &s;lacken|ing
towards Night, the Captain ordered not to
weigh till next Morning.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Night 23 of the Men, among whom
was the Gunner's Mate, the Surgeon's A&s;&s;i&s;tant,
and two Carpenters, applying to the Chief Mate,
told him, that as the Captain had given them
Leave to go on Shore to their Comerades, they
begged, that he would &s;peak to the Captain not
to take it ill that they were de&s;irous to go and
die with their Companions; and that they
thought they could do no le&s;s in &s;uch an Ex|tremity,
than go to them; becau&s;e if there was
any way to &s;ave their Lives, it was by adding
to their Numbers, and making them &s;trong
enough to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in defending them|&s;elves
again&s;t the Savages, till perhaps they might
one time or other find Means to make their
E&s;cape, and get to their own Country again.</P>
<P>The Mate told them in &s;o many Words, that
he dur&s;t not &s;peak to the Captain upon any &s;uch
De&s;ign, and was very &s;orry they had no more
Re&s;pect for him, than to de&s;ire him to go of
<PB N="23" REF="25">
&s;uch an Errand; but if they were re&s;olved up|on
&s;uch an Enterprize, he would advi&s;e them to
take the Long-Boat in the Morning betimes, and
go off, &s;eeing the Captain had given them Leave,
and leave a civil Letter behind them to the
Captain, and to de&s;ire him to &s;end his Men on
Shore for the Boat, which &s;hould be delivered
very hone&s;tly, and he promi&s;ed to keep their
Coun&s;el &s;o long.</P>
<P>Accordingly an Hour before Day, tho&s;e 23
Men, with every Man a Fire-lock and Cutla&s;s,
with &s;ome Pi&s;tols, three Halbards or Half-Pikes,
and good Store of Powder and Ball, without any
Provi&s;ion but about Half and Hundred of Bread,
but with all their Che&s;ts and Clothes, Tools,
In&s;truments, Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> embarked them&s;elves &s;o
&s;ilently, that the Captain got no Notice of it till
they were gotten half the Way on Shore.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Captain heard of it, he called
for the Gunner's Mate, <HI>the Chief Gunner being at that
time &s;ick in his Cabbin,</HI> and ordered to fire at them;
but, to his great Mortification, the Gunner's
Mate was one of the Number, and was gone with
them; and indeed it was by his Means they
got &s;o many Arms, and &s;o much Ammunition.
When the Captain found how it was, and that
there was no Help for it, he began to be a little
appea&s;ed, made light of it, and called up the
Men, &s;poke kindly to them, and told them he
was very well &s;atisfied in the Fidelity and Abi|lity
of tho&s;e that were now left; and that he
would give to them, for their Encouragement,
to be divided among them, the Wages which was
due to the Men that were gone; and that it was a
great Satisfaction to him that the Ship was freed
<PB N="24" REF="26">
from &s;uch a mutinous Rabble, who had not the
lea&s;t Rea&s;on for their Di&s;content.</P>
<P>The Men &s;eemed very well &s;atisfied, and par|ticularly
the Promi&s;e of the Wages of tho&s;e that
were gone, went a great way with them. After
this the Letter which was left by the Men was
given to the Captain, by his Boy, with whom,
it &s;eems, the Men had left it. The Letter was
much to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e of what they had &s;aid
to the Mate, and which he declined to &s;ay
for them; only that at the End of their Letter
they told the Captain, that as they had no di&s;|hone&s;t
De&s;ign, &s;o they had taken nothing away
with them which was not their own, except
&s;ome Arms and Ammunition, &s;uch as were ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to them, as well for their De|fence
again&s;t the Savages, as to kill Fowls or
Bea&s;ts for their Food, that they might not pe|ri&s;h;
and as there were con&s;iderable Sums due
to them for Wages, they hoped he would al|low
the Arms and Ammunition upon their Ac|counts.
They told him, that as to the Ship's
Long-Boat which they had taken to bring them
on Shore, they knew it was nece&s;&s;ary to him,
and they were very willing to re&s;tore it to him;
and if he plea&s;ed to &s;end for it, it &s;hould be very
hone&s;tly delivered to his Men, and not the lea&s;t
Injury offered to any of tho&s;e who came for it,
nor the lea&s;t Per&s;wa&s;ion or Invitation made u&s;e
of to any of them to &s;tay with them; and at
the Bottom of the Letter they very humbly be|&s;ought
him, that for their Defence, and for the
Safety of their Lives he would be plea&s;ed to &s;end
them a Barrel of Powder, and &s;ome Ammuni|tion,
and give them Leave to keep the Ma&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="27">
and Sail of the Boat, that if it was po&s;&s;ible for
them to make them&s;elves a Boat of any kind,
they might &s;hift off to Sea to &s;ave them&s;elves in
&s;uch Part of the World as their Fate &s;hould di|rect
them to.</P>
<P>Upon this the Captain, who had won much
upon the re&s;t of his Men by what he had &s;aid
to them, and was very ea&s;y as to the General
Peace; (for it was very true, that the mo&s;t mu|tinous
of the Men were gone) came out to the
Quarter-Deck, and calling the Men together,
let them know the Sub&s;tance of the Letter; and
told the Men, that however they had not de|&s;erved
&s;uch Civility from him, yet he was not
willing to expo&s;e them more than they were wil|ling
to expo&s;e them&s;elves, he was inclined to
&s;end them &s;ome Ammunition; and as they had
de&s;ired but one Barrel of Powder, he would &s;end
them two Barrels, and Shot, or Lead, and
Moulds to make Shot in proportion: and, to
let them &s;ee that he was civiller to them than
they de&s;erved, he ordered a Cask of Arrack,
and a great Bag of Bread to be &s;ent them for
Sub&s;i&s;tence, till they &s;hould be able to furni&s;h
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Men applauded the Captain's
Genero&s;ity, and every one of them &s;ent us
&s;ome thing or other; and about three in the Af|ternoon
the Pinnace came on Shore, and brought
us all the&s;e things, which we were very glad
of, and returned the Long-Boat accordingly;
and as to the Men that came with the Pinnace,
as the Captain had &s;ingled out &s;uch Men as he
knew would not come over to us, &s;o they had
po&s;itive Orders not to bring any one of us on
board again, upon Pain of Death; and indeed
<PB N="26" REF="28">
both were &s;o true to our Points, that we neither
asked them to &s;tay, nor they us to go.</P>
<P>We were now a good Troop, being in all 27
Men, very well armed and provided with every
thing but Victuals; we had two Carpenters
among us, a Gunner, and, which was worth all
the re&s;t, a Surgeon or Doctor, that is to &s;ay, he
was an A&s;&s;i&s;tant to a Surgeon at <HI>Goa,</HI> and was
entertained as Supernumerary with us: The
Carperters had brought all their Tools, the
Doctor all his In&s;truments and Medicines, and
indeed we had a great deal of Baggage, that is
to &s;ay, in the whole, for <HI>&s;ome of us</HI> had little
more than the Clothes on our Backs, of whom
I was one; but I had one thing which none of
them had <HI>viz.</HI> I had the 22 Moydores of Gold,
which I &s;tole at the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> and two Pieces of
Eight. The two Peices of Eight I &s;hewed, and
one Moydore, but no more; and none of them ever
&s;u&s;pected that I had any more Money in the World,
having been known to be only a poor Boy taken up
in Charity, as you have heard, and u&s;ed like a
Slave, and in the wor&s;t Manner of a Slave, by
my cruel Ma&s;ter the Pilot.</P>
<P>It will be ea&s;y to imagine we four, that were
left at fir&s;t, were joyful, nay, even &s;urprized
with Joy, at the coming of the re&s;t, tho' at fir&s;t
we were frighted, and thought they came to fetch
us back to hang us; but they took ways quick|ly
to &s;atisfy us that they were in the &s;ame Con|dition
with us, only with this additional Cir|cum&s;tance,
that theirs was voluntarily, and ours
by Force.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Piece of News they told us after the
&s;hort Hi&s;tory of their coming away, was, that
our Companion was on board, but how he got
<PB N="27" REF="29">
thither we could not imagine; for he had given us
the Slip, and we never imagined he could &s;wim
&s;o well as to venture off to the Ship, which lay
at &s;o great a Di&s;tance; nay, we did not &s;o much
as know that he could &s;wim at all, and not
thinking any thing of what really happen'd, we
thought that he mu&s;t have wandered into the
Woods, and was devoured, or was fallen into the
Hands of the Natives and was murthered; and
the&s;e Thoughts filled us with Fears enough, and
of &s;everal kinds, about its being &s;ome time or
other our Lot to fall into their Hands al&s;o.</P>
<P>But hearing how he had with much Difficulty
been received on board the Ship again, and par|don'd,
we were much better &s;atisfied than
before.</P>
<P>Being now, as I have &s;aid, a con&s;iderable Num|ber
of us, and in Condition to defend our &s;elves,
the fir&s;t thing we did was to give every one his
Hand, that we would not &s;eparate from one
another upon any Occa&s;ion what&s;oever, but that
we would live and die together; that we would
kill no Food, but that we would di&s;tribute it in
publick; and that we would be in all things
guided by the Majority, and not in&s;i&s;t upon
our own Re&s;olutions in any thing, if the Majority
were again&s;t it; that we would appoint a Cap|tain
among us to be our Governour or Leader
during Plea&s;ure; that while he was in Office, we
would obey him without Re&s;erve, on Pain of
Death; and that every one &s;hould take Turn,
but the Captain was not to act in any particular
thing without Advice of the re&s;t, and by the
Majority.</P>
<P>Having e&s;tabli&s;hed the&s;e Rules, we re&s;olved to
enter into &s;ome Mea&s;ures for our Food, and for
<PB N="28" REF="30">
conver&s;ing with the Inhabitants or Natives of
the I&s;land, for our Supply; as for Food, they
were at fir&s;t very u&s;eful to us, but we &s;oon grew
weary of them, being an ignorant, ravenous,
bruti&s;h &s;ort of People, even wor&s;e than the Na|tives
of any other Country that we had &s;een;
and we &s;oon found that the principal Part of our
Sub&s;i&s;tance was to be had by our Guns, &s;hoot|ing
of Deer and other Creatures, and Fowls of
all other Sorts, of which there is Abundance.</P>
<P>We found the Natives did not di&s;turb or con|cern
them&s;elves much about us; nor did they
enquire, or perhaps know whether we &s;tay'd
among them or not, much le&s;s that our Ship
was gone quite away, and had ca&s;t us off, as
was our Ca&s;e; for the next Morning after we
had &s;ent back the Long-Boat, the Ship &s;tood
away to the South-Ea&s;t, and in four Hours time
was out of our Sight.</P>
<P>The next Day two of us went out into the
Country one Way, and two another, to &s;ee what
kind of a Land we were in; and we &s;oon found
the Country was very plea&s;ant and fruitful, and
a convenient Place enough to live in; but as be|fore,
inhabited by a Parcel of Creatures &s;carce
human, or capable of being made &s;ociable on any
Account what&s;oever.</P>
<P>We found the Place full of Cattle and Pro|vi&s;ions;
but whether we might venture to take
them where we could find them, or not, we
did not know; and tho' we were under a Nece&s;&s;i|ty
to get Provi&s;ions, yet we were loath to bring
down a whole Nation of Devils upon us at once,
and therefore &s;ome of our Company agreed to
try to &s;peak with &s;ome of the Country, if we
could, that we might &s;ee what Cour&s;e was to be
<PB N="29" REF="31">
taken with them. Eleven of our Men went of
this Errand, well armed, and furni&s;hed for De|fence.
They brought Word, that they had
&s;een &s;ome of the Natives, who appeared very
civil to them, but very &s;hy and afraid, &s;eeing
their Guns; for it was ea&s;y to perceive, that
the Natives knew what their Guns were, and
what U&s;e they were of.</P>
<P>They made Signs to the Natives for &s;ome Food,
and they went and fetched &s;everal Herbs and
Roots, and &s;ome Milk; but it was evident
they did not de&s;ign to give it away, but to &s;ell,
making Signs to know what our Men would
give them.</P>
<P>Our Men were perplexed at this, for they
had nothing to Barter; however, one of the
Men pulled out a Knife and &s;hewed them, and
they were &s;o fond of it, that they were ready
to go together by the Ears for the Knife: The
Seaman &s;eeing that, was willing to make a good
Market of his Knife, and keeping them chaffer|ing
about it a good while, &s;ome offered him
Roots, and others Milk; at la&s;t one offered him
a Goat for it, which he took. Then another
of our Men &s;hewed them another Knife, but
they had nothing good enough for that; where|upon
one of them made Signs that he would
go and fetch &s;omething; &s;o our Men &s;tay'd three
Hours for their Return, when they came back
and brought him a &s;mall &s;ized, thick, &s;hort
Cow, very fat, and good Meat, and gave him
for his Knife.</P>
<P>This was a good Market, but our Misfortune
was we had no Merchandize; for our Knives
were as needful to us as to them, and but that
we were in Di&s;tre&s;s for Food, and mu&s;t of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="30" REF="32">
have &s;ome, the&s;e Men would not have
parted with their Knives.</P>
<P>However, in a little time more we found that
the Woods were full of living Creatures which
we might kill for our Food, and that without
giving Offence to them; &s;o that our Men went
daily out a Hunting, and never failed to kill
&s;omething or other; for as to the Natives, we
had no Goods to Barter; and for Money, all
the Stock among us would not have fub&s;i&s;ted
us long; however, we called a general Council
to &s;ee what Money we had, and to bring it
all together, that it might go as far as po&s;&s;ible;
and when it came to my Turn, I pulled out
a Moydore and the two Dollars I &s;poke of
before.</P>
<P>This Moydore I ventured to &s;hew, that they
might not de&s;pi&s;e me too much for adding too
little to the Store, and that they might not
pretend to &s;earch me; and they were very ci|vil
to me upon the Pre&s;umption that I had been
&s;o faithful to them as not to conceal any thing
from them.</P>
<P>But our Money did us little Service, for the
People neither knew the Value or the U&s;e of
it, nor could they ju&s;tly rate the Gold in Pro|portion
with the Silver; &s;o that all our Money,
which was not much when it was all put to|gether,
would go but a little way with us, that
is to &s;ay, to buy us Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Our next Con&s;ideration was to get away from
this cur&s;ed Place, and whether to go; when my
Opinion came to be asked, I told them I would
leave that all to them, and I told them I had
rather they would let me go into the Woods
to get them &s;ome Provi&s;ions, than con&s;ult with
<PB N="31" REF="33">
me, for I would agree to whatever they did;
but they would not agree to that, for they
would not con&s;ent that any of us &s;hould go into
the Woods alone; for tho' we had yet &s;een no
Lions or Tygers in the Woods, we were a&s;&s;ured
there were many in the I&s;land, be&s;ides other
Creatures as dangerous, and, perhaps wor&s;e,
as we afterwards found by our own Experience.</P>
<P>We had many Adventures in the Woods for
our Provi&s;ions, and often met with wild and
terrible Bea&s;ts, which we could not call by their
Names, but as they were like us &s;eeking their
Prey, but were them&s;elves good for nothing,
&s;o we di&s;turbed them as little as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Our Con&s;ultations concerning our E&s;cape from
this Place, which as I have &s;aid, we were now
upon, ended in this only, that as we had two
Carpenters among us, and that they had Tools
almo&s;t of all Sorts with them, we &s;hould try
to build us a Boat to go off to Sea with, and that
then perhaps we might find our way back to
<HI>Goa,</HI> or land on &s;ome more proper Place to make
our E&s;cape. The Coun&s;els of this A&s;&s;embly
were not of great Moment, yet as they &s;eem
to be introductory of many more remarkable
Adventures which happened under my Con|duct
hereabouts many Years after, I think this
Miniature of my future Enterprizes may not be
unplea&s;ant to relate.</P>
<P>To the Building of a Boat I made no Ob|jection,
and away they went to work imme|diately;
but as they went on, great Difficulties
occurred, &s;uch as want of Saws to cut out Plank;
Nails, Bolts, and Spikes, to fa&s;ten the Timbers,
Hemp, Pitch and Tar, to Caulk and Pay her
Seams, <HI>and the like:</HI> At length one of the Com|pany
<PB N="32" REF="34">
propo&s;ed, that in&s;tead of building a Bark
or Sloop, or Shalloup, or whatever they would
call it, which they found was &s;o difficult, they
&s;hould rather make a large <HI>Periagua,</HI> or Canoe,
which might be done with great Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It was pre&s;ently objected, that we could never
make a Canoe large enough to pa&s;s the great
Ocean, which we were to go over, to get to
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI> that it not only would
not bear the Sea, but it would never bear the
Burthen; for we were not only Twenty &s;even
Men of us, but had a great deal of Luggage
with us, and mu&s;t, for our Provi&s;ion, take in a
great deal more.</P>
<P>I never propo&s;ed to &s;peak in their General
Con&s;ultations before; but finding they were at
&s;ome Lo&s;s about what kind of Ve&s;&s;el they &s;hould
make, and how to make it; and what would be
fit for our U&s;e, and what not; I told them I
found they were at a full Stop in their Coun&s;els
of every kind; that it was true we could never
pretend to go over to <HI>Goa,</HI> or the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Malabar</HI> in a Canoe, which tho' we could all
get into it, and that it would bear the Sea
well enough, yet would not hold our Provi|&s;ions,
and e&s;pecially we could not put fre&s;h
Water enough into it for the Voyage; and to
make &s;uch an Adventure would be nothing but
meer running into certain De&s;truction, and yet
that neverthele&s;s I was for making a Canoe.</P>
<P>They an&s;wered, that they under&s;tood all I had
&s;aid before well enough, but what I meant by
telling them fir&s;t how dangerous and impo&s;&s;ible
it was to make our E&s;cape in a Canoe, and yet
then to advi&s;e making a Canoe, that they could
not under&s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35">
To this I an&s;wer'd, that I conceiv'd our Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
was not to attempt our E&s;cape in a Canoe,
but that as there were other Ve&s;&s;els at Sea be|&s;ides
our Ship, and that there were few Nations
that lived on the Sea-Shore that were &s;o barba|rous,
but that they went to Sea in &s;ome Boats
or other, our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to crui&s;e along the
Coa&s;t of the I&s;land, which was very long, and
to &s;eize upon the fir&s;t we could get that was bet|ter
than our own, and &s;o from that to another,
till perhaps we might at la&s;t get a good Ship
to carry us whither ever we plea&s;ed to go.</P>
<P>Excellent Advice, &s;ays one of them, admira|ble
Advice, &s;ays another. Yes, yes, &s;ays the
third, which was the Gunner, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dog
has given excellent Advice; but it is ju&s;t the
way to bring us all to the Gallows; the Rogue
has given Devili&s;h Advice, indeed, to go a
Thieving, till from a little Ve&s;&s;el we come to a
great Ship, and &s;o we &s;hall turn downright
Pyrates, the End of which is to be hanged.</P>
<P>You may call us Pyrates, &s;ays another, if you
will, and if we fall into bad Hands, we may be
u&s;ed like Pyrates; but I care not for that, I'll
be a Pyrate, or any thing, nay, I'll be hang'd
for a Pyrate, rather than &s;tarve here; and there|fore
I think the Advice is very good; and &s;o
they cry'd all, Let us have a Canoe. The Gun|ner
over-ruled by the re&s;t, &s;ubmitted; but as
we broke up the Council, he came to me, takes
me by the Hand, and looking into the Palm of
my hand, and into my Face too, very gravely,
My Lad, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> thou art born to do a World
of Mi&s;cheif; thou ha&s;t commenced Pyrate very
young, but have a Caree of the Gallows, young
<PB N="34" REF="36">
Man; have a Care, I &s;ay, for thou wilt be an
eminent Thief.</P>
<P>I laugh'd at him, and told him, I did not
know what I might come to hereafter; but as
our Ca&s;e was now&punc; I &s;hould make no Scruple to
take the fir&s;t Ship I came at, to get our Liber|ty:
I only wi&s;h'd we could &s;ee one, and come
at her. Ju&s;t while we were talking, one of our
Men that was at the Door of our Hutt, told us,
that the Carpenter, who, it &s;eems, was upon a
Hill at a Di&s;tance, cried out, <HI>a Sail, a Sail.</HI></P>
<P>We all turn'd out immediately; but tho' it
was very clear Weather, we could &s;ee nothing;
but the Carpenter continuing to holloo to us, <HI>a
Sail, a Sail,</HI> away we run up the Hill, and there
we &s;aw a Ship plainly; but it was at a very great
Di&s;tance, too far for us to make any Signal to
her. However, we made a Fire upon the Hill,
with all the Wood we could get together, and
made as much Smoke as po&s;&s;ible. The Wind
was down, and it was almo&s;t calm; but as we
thought by a Per&s;pective Gla&s;s which the Gun|ner
had in his Pocket, her Sails were full,
and &s;he &s;tood away large with the Wind at
E. N. E. taking no Notice of our Signal,
but making for the Cape <HI>de bona Speranza;</HI> &s;o
we had no Comfort from her.</P>
<P>We went therefore immediately to Work about
our intended Canoe, and having &s;ingled out a ve|ry
large Tree to our Mind, we fell to Work with
her; and having three good Axes among us, we
got it down, but it was four Days time fir&s;t, tho'
we worked very hard too. I do not remember
what Wood it was, or exactly what Dimen&s;i|ons&punc;
but I remember that it was a very large one,
and we were as much encouraged when we laun|ched
<PB N="35" REF="37">
it, and found it &s;wam upright and &s;teady,
as we would have been at another time, if we
had a good Man of War at our Command.</P>
<P>She was &s;o very large, that &s;he carried us all
very ea&s;ily, and would have carried two or
three Ton of Baggage with us; &s;o that we began
to con&s;ult about going to Sea directly to <HI>Goa;</HI> but
many other Con&s;iderations check'd that Thought,
e&s;pecially when we came to look nearer into it;
&s;uch as Want of Provi&s;ions, and no Casks for fre&s;h
Water; no Compa&s;s to &s;teer by; no Shelter from
the Breach of the high Sea, which would cer|tainly
founder us; no Defence from the Heat of
the Weather, and the like; &s;o that they all came
readily into my Project, to crui&s;e about where
we were, and &s;ee what might offer.</P>
<P>Accordingly, to gratify our Fancy, we went
one Day all out to Sea in her together, and we
were in a very fair Way to have had enough of
it; for when &s;he had us all on Board, and that
we were gotten about Half a League to Sea, there
happening to be a pretty high Swell of the Sea,
tho' little or no Wind, yet &s;he wallow'd &s;o in
the Sea, that we all of us thought &s;he would
at la&s;t wallow her &s;elf Bottom up; &s;o we &s;et
all to Work to get her in nearer the Shore, and
giving her fre&s;h Way in the Sea, &s;he &s;wam more
&s;teady, and with &s;ome hard Work we got her
under the Land again.</P>
<P>We were now at a great Lo&s;s; the Natives
were civil enough to us, and came often to di&s;|cour&s;e
with us; one time they brought one whom
they &s;hew'd Re&s;pect to as a King, with them,
and they &s;et up a long Pole between them and
us, with a great To&s;&s;el of Hair hanging, not on
the Top, but &s;omething above the Middle of it,
<PB N="36" REF="38">
adorn'd with little Chains, Shells, Bits of Bra&s;s,
and the like; and this we under&s;tood afterwards
was a Token of Amity and Friend&s;hip, and they
brought down to us Victuals in Abundance, Cat|tel,
Fowls, Herbs, Roots, but we were in the
utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion on our Side; for we had no|thing
to buy with, or exchange for; and as to
giving us things for nothing, they had no No|tion
of that again. As to our Money, it was
meer Tra&s;h to them, they had no Value for it;
&s;o that we were in a fair Way to be &s;tarved.
Had we had but &s;ome Toys and Trinckets, Bra&s;s
Chains, Baubles, Gla&s;s Beads, or in a Word, the
verie&s;t Trifles that a Ship Loading would not have
been worth the Freight, we might have bought
Cattel and Provi&s;ions enough for an Army, or
to Victual a Fleet of Men of War, but for Gold
or Silver we could get nothing.</P>
<P>Upon this we were in a &s;trange Con&s;ternati|on.
I was but a young Fellow, but I was for
falling upon them with our Fire Arms; and
taking all the Cattel from them, and &s;end them
to the Devil to &s;top their Hunger, rather than
be &s;tarved our &s;elves; but I did not con&s;ider
that this might have brought Ten Thou&s;and of
them down upon us the next Day; and tho'
we might have killed a va&s;t Number of them,
and perhaps have frighted the re&s;t, yet their
own De&s;peration, and our &s;mall Number, would
have animated them &s;o, that one time or other
they would have de&s;troy'd us all.</P>
<P>In the Middle of our Con&s;ultation, one of
our Men who had been a kind of a Cutler, or
Worker in Iron, &s;tarted up, and ask'd the Car|penter,
if among all his Tools he could not help
him to a File. Yes, &s;ays the Carpenter, I can,
<PB N="37" REF="39">
but it is a &s;mall one. The &s;maller the better,
&s;ays the other. Upon this he goes to Work,
and fir&s;t by heating a Piece of an old broken
Chi&s;&s;el in the Fire, and then with the Help of
his File, he made him&s;elf &s;everal Kinds of Tools
for his Work; and then he takes three or four
Pieces of Eight, and beats them out with a Ham|mer
upon a Stone, till they were very broad and
thin, then he cut them out into the Shape of
Birds and Bea&s;t; he made little Chains of them
for Bracelets and Necklaces, and turn'd them in|to
&s;o many Devices, of his own Head, that it is
hardly to be expre&s;t.</P>
<P>When he had for about a Fortnight exerci&s;ed
his Head and Hands at this Work, we try'd the
Effect of his Ingenuity; and having another Mee|ting
with the Natives, were &s;urprized to &s;ee the
Folly of the poor People. For a little Bit of
Silver cut out in the Shape of a Bird, we had
two Cows; and, which was our Lo&s;s, if it had
been in Bra&s;s, it had been &s;till of more Value.
For one of the Bracelets made of Chain-work,
we had as much Provi&s;ion of &s;everal Sorts, as
would fairly have been worth in <HI>England,</HI> Fifteen
or Sixteen Pounds; and &s;o of all the re&s;t. Thus,
that which when it was in Coin was not worth
Six-pence to us, when thus converted into Toys
and Trifles, was worth an Hundred Times its
real Value, and purcha&s;ed for us any thing we
had Occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>In this Condition, we lived upwards of a Year,
but all of us began to be very much tir'd of it, and
whatever came of it, re&s;olv'd to attempt an E&s;cape.
We had furni&s;hed our &s;elves with no le&s;s than
three very good Canoes; and as the <HI>Mon&s;oones,</HI>
or Trade-Winds, generally affect that Country,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
blowing in mo&s;t Parts of this I&s;land one &s;ix Months
of a Year one Way, and the other &s;ix Months
another Way, we concluded we might be able
to bear the Sea well enough. But always when
we came to look nearer into it, the Want of
fre&s;h Water was the thing that put us off from
&s;uch an Adventure, for it is a prodigious Length,
and what no Man on Earth could be able to
perform without Water to drink.</P>
<P>Being thus prevailed upon by our own Rea|&s;on
to &s;et the Thoughts of that Voyage a&s;ide,
we had then but two things before us; one was,
to put to Sea the other Way, <HI>viz.</HI> We&s;t, and go
away for the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> where fir&s;t or
la&s;t we &s;hould meet with &s;ome of our own Coun|try
Ships, or el&s;e to put for the main Land of
<HI>Africa,</HI> and either travel by Land, or &s;ail along
the Coa&s;t towards the Red Sea, where we &s;hould
fir&s;t or la&s;t find a Ship of &s;ome Nation or other,
that would take us up, or perhaps we might take
them up; which, by the bye, was the thing that
always run in my Head.</P>
<P>It was our ingenious Cutler, whom ever after
we called <HI>Silver-Smith,</HI> that propo&s;ed this; but
the Gunner told him, that he had been in the
Red Sea, in a <HI>Malabar</HI> Sloop, and he knew this,
that if we went into the Red Sea, we &s;hould
either be killed by the wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> or taken and
made Slaves of by the <HI>Turks;</HI> and therefore he
was not for going that Way.</P>
<P><HI>Upon this I took Occa&s;ion to put in my Vote
again.</HI> Why, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> do we talk of being killed by the
<HI>Arabs,</HI> or made Slaves of by the <HI>Turks?</HI> Are we not
able to board almost any Ve&s;&s;el we &s;hall meet with in
tho&s;e Seas; and in&s;tead of their taking us, we to take
them? <HI>Well done,</HI> Pyrate, <HI>&s;aid the Gunner, he
<PB N="39" REF="41">
that had look'd in my Hand, and told me I
&s;hould come to the Gallows;</HI> I'll &s;ay that for
him, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> he always looks the &s;ame Way. But I
think o' my Con&s;cience? 'tis our only Way now. <HI>Don't
tell me,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>of being a Pyrate,</HI> we must be Pyrates,
or any thing, to get fairly out of this cur&s;ed Place.</P>
<P>In a Word, they concluded all by my Advice,
that our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to cruize for any thing
we could &s;ee. Why then, <HI>&s;aid I</HI> to them, our
fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;ee, if the People upon this
I&s;land have no Navigation, and what Boats they
u&s;e; and if they have any better or bigger than
ours, let us take one of them. Fir&s;t indeed all
our Aim was to get, if po&s;&s;ible, a Boat with a
Deck and a Sail; for then we might have &s;aved
our Provi&s;ions, which otherwi&s;e we could not.</P>
<P>We had, to our great good Fortune, one Sailor
among us, who had been A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Cook,
he told us, that he would find a Way how to
pre&s;erve our Beef, without Cask or Pickle; and
this he did effectually by curing it in the Sun,
with the Help of Salt-Petre, of which there
was great Plenty in the I&s;land; &s;o that before
we found any Method for our E&s;cape, we had
dry'd the Fle&s;h of &s;ix or &s;even Cows and Bul|locks,
and ten or twelve Goats, and it reli&s;hed &s;o
well, that we never gave our &s;elves the Trou|ble
to boil it when we eat it, but either broiled
it, or eat it dry: But our main Difficulty about
fre&s;h Water &s;till remained; for we had no Ve&s;|&s;el
to put any into, much le&s;s to keep any for
our going to Sea.</P>
<P>But our fir&s;t Voyage being only to coa&s;t the
I&s;land, we re&s;olved to venture? whatever the
Hazard or Con&s;equence of it might be; and in
order to pre&s;erve as much fre&s;h Water as we
<PB N="40" REF="42">
could, our Carpenter made a Well thwart the
Middle of one of our Canoes, which he &s;epa|rated
from the other Parts of the Canoe, &s;o as to
make it tight to hold the Water, and cover'd
&s;o as we might &s;tep upon it; and this was &s;o
large, that it held near a Hog&s;head of Water
very well. I cannot better de&s;cribe this Well,
than by the &s;ame Kind which the &s;mall Fi&s;her-Boats
in <HI>England</HI> have to pre&s;erve their Fi&s;h alive
in; only, that this, in&s;tead of having Holes to
let the Salt Water in, was made &s;ound every
Way to keep it out; and it was the fir&s;t Inven|tion,
I believe, of its Kind, for &s;uch an U&s;e:
But Nece&s;&s;ity is a Spur to Ingenuity, and the
Mother of Invention.</P>
<P>It wanted but a little Con&s;ultation to re&s;olve
now upon our Voyage. The fir&s;t De&s;ign was only
to coa&s;t it round the I&s;land, as well to &s;ee if we
could &s;eize upon any Ve&s;&s;el fit to embark our &s;elves
in, as al&s;o to take hold of any Opportunity which
might pre&s;ent for our pa&s;&s;ing over to the Main;
and therefore our Re&s;olution was to go on the
In&s;ide, or We&s;t Shore of the I&s;land, where at
lea&s;t at one Point, the Land &s;tretching a great
Way to the North-We&s;t, the Di&s;tance is not
extraordinary great from the I&s;land to the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Africk.</HI></P>
<P>Such a Voyage, and with &s;uch a de&s;perate
Crew, I believe was never made; for it is cer|tain
we took the wor&s;t Side of the I&s;land to look
for any Shipping, e&s;pecially for Shipping of other
Nations, this being quite out of the Way: How|ever,
we put to Sea, after taking all our Provi&s;i|ons
and Ammunition, Bag and Baggage on Board;
we had made both Ma&s;t and Sail for our two
large Periagua's, and the other we paddl'd along
<PB N="41" REF="43">
as well as we could; but when a Gale &s;prung up,
we took her in Tow.</P>
<P>We &s;ail'd merrily forward for &s;everal Days,
meeting with nothing to interrupt us, We &s;aw
&s;everal of the Natives in &s;mall Canoes, catching
Fi&s;h, and &s;ometimes we endeavoured to come near
enough to &s;peak with them, but they were al|ways
&s;hye, and afraid of us, making in for the
Shore, as &s;oon as we attempted it; till one of our
Company remember'd the Signal of Friend&s;hip
which the Natives made us from the South Part of
the I&s;land, <HI>viz.</HI> of &s;etting up a long Pole, and put
us in Mind, that perhaps it was the &s;ame thing
to them as a Flag of Truce was to us: So we
re&s;olved to try it; and accordingly the next time
we &s;aw any of their Fi&s;hing Boats at Sea, we put
up a Pole in our Canoe that had no Sail, and
rowed towards them. As &s;oon as they &s;aw the
Pole, they &s;taid for us, and as we came nearer,
paddl'd towards us. When they came to us,
they &s;hewed them&s;elves very much plea&s;ed, and
gave us &s;ome large Fi&s;h, of which we did not
know the Names, bnt they were very good. It
was our Misfortune &s;till, that we had nothing to
give them in Return; but our Arti&s;t, of whom
I &s;poke before, gave them two little thin Plates
of Silver, beaten, as I &s;aid before, out of a Piece
of Eight; they were cut in a Diamond Square,
longer one way than t'other, and a Hole punch'd
at one of the longe&s;t Corners. This they were
&s;o found of, that they made us &s;tay till they had
ca&s;t their Lines and Nets again, and gave us as
many Fi&s;h as we cared to have.</P>
<P>All this while we had our Eyes upon their
Boats, view'd them very narrowly, and exami|ned
whether any of them were fit for our Turn;
<PB N="42" REF="44">
but they were poor &s;orry things; their Sail was
made of a large Matt, only one that was of a
Piece of Cotton Stuff, fit for little, and their
Ropes were twi&s;ted Flags, of no Strength; &s;o we
concluded we were better as we were, and let
them alone. We went forward to the North,
keeping the Coa&s;t clo&s;e on Board for twelve Days
together; and having the Wind at Ea&s;t, and
E. S. E. we made very fre&s;h Way. We &s;aw no
Towns on the Shore, but often &s;aw &s;ome Hutts
by the Water Side, upon the Rocks, and always
Abundance of People about them, who we could
perceive run together to ftare at us.</P>
<P>It was as odd a Voyage as ever Men went:
We were a little Fleet of three Ships, and an
Army of between Twenty and Thirty as dangerous
Fellows as ever they had among them; and had
they known what we were they would have com|pounded
to give us every thing we de&s;ired, to
be rid of us.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, we were as mi&s;erable as
Nature could well make us to be; for we were
upon <HI>a</HI> Voyage and <HI>no</HI> Voyage, we were bound
<HI>&s;ome</HI> where and <HI>no</HI> where; for tho' we knew
what we intended to do, we did really not know
what we were doing: We went forward and for|ward
by a Northerly Cour&s;e; and as we advan|ced,
the Heat increa&s;ed, which began to be into|lerable
to us who were upon the Water, with|out
any Covering from Heat or Wet; be&s;ides
we were now in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> or there|abouts,
in a Southern Latitude, and as we went eve|ry
Day nearer the Sun, the Sun came al&s;o eve|ry
Day nearer to us, till at la&s;t we found our
&s;elves in the Latitude of 20 Degrees, and having
pa&s;t the Tropick about five or &s;ix Days before that,
<PB N="43" REF="45">
in a few Days more the Sun would be in the
Zenith, ju&s;t over our Heads.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations we re&s;olved to &s;eek
for a good Place to go on Shore again, and pitch
our Tents till the Heat of the Weather abated.
We had by this time mea&s;ured Half the Length
of the I&s;land, and were come to that Part where
the Shore tending away to the North-We&s;t, pro|mi&s;ed
fair to make our Pa&s;&s;age over to the main
Land of <HI>Africk,</HI> much &s;horter than we expected.
But notwith&s;tanding that, we had good Rea&s;on
to believe it was about 120 Leagues.</P>
<P>So, the Heats con&s;ider'd, we re&s;olved to take
Harbour; be&s;ides, our Provi&s;ions were exhau|&s;ted,
and we had not many Days Store left.
Accordingly, putting in for the Shore early in
the Morning, as we u&s;ually did once in three
or four Days, for fre&s;h Water, we &s;at down
and con&s;idered, whether we &s;hould go on, or take
up our Standing there; but upon &s;everal Con|&s;iderations
too long to repeat here, we did not
like the Place, &s;o we re&s;olved to go on for a few
Days longer.</P>
<P>After Sailing on N. W. by N. with a fre&s;h Gale
at S. E. about &s;ix Days, we found at a great Di|&s;tance,
a large Promontory, or Cape of Land,
pu&s;hing out a long Way into the Sea; and as
we were exceeding fond of &s;eeing what was be|yond
the Cape, we re&s;olved to double it before
we took into Harbour; &s;o we kept on our Way,
the Gale continuing, and yet it was four Days
more before we reach'd the Cape. But it is
not po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Di&s;couragement and
Melancholy that &s;eized us all when we came
thither; for when we made the Head Land
of the Cape, we were &s;urprized to &s;ee the Shore
<PB N="44" REF="46">
fall away on the other Side, as much as it had
advanced on this Side, and a great deal more;
and that, in &s;hort, if we would adventure over
to the Shore of <HI>Africk,</HI> it mu&s;t be from hence;
for that if we went further, the Breadth of the
Sea &s;till increa&s;ed, and to what Breadth it might
increa&s;e, we knew not.</P>
<P>While we mu&s;ed upon this Di&s;covery, we were
&s;urprized with very bad Weather, and e&s;pecially
violent Rains, with Thunder and Lightning mo&s;t
unu&s;ually terrible to us. In this Pickle we run
for the Shore, and getting under the Lee of the
Cape, run our Frigates into a little Creek, where
we &s;aw the Land overgrown with Trees, and
made all the Ha&s;te po&s;&s;ible to get on Shore, be|ing
exceeding wet, and fatigued with the Heat,
the Thunder, Lightning and Rain.</P>
<P>Here we thought our Ca&s;e was very deplora|ble
indeed, and therefore our Arti&s;t, of whom
I have &s;poken &s;o often, &s;et up a great Cro&s;s of
Wood on the Hill, which was within a Mile of
the Head Land, with the&s;e Words, but in the
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Language.</P>
<P>Point De&s;peration. Je&s;us have Mercy!</P>
<P>We &s;et to work immediately to build us &s;ome
Hutts, and &s;o get our Clothes dry'd, and tho' I
was young, and had no Skill in &s;uch Things,
yet I &s;hall never forget the little City we built,
for it was no le&s;s; and we fortify'd it accordingly;
and the Idea is &s;o fre&s;h in my Thought, that I can|not
but give a &s;hort De&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>Our Camp was on the South Side of a little
Creek on the Sea, and under the Shelter of a &s;teep
Hill, which lay, tho' on the other Side of the
Creek, yet within a Quarter of a Mile of us
N. W. by N. and very happily itercepted the
<PB N="45" REF="47">
Heat of the Sun all the after Part of the Day.
The Spot we pitched on had a little fre&s;h Water,
Brook, or a Stream running into the Creek by
us, and we &s;aw Cattle feeding in the Plains and
and low Ground, Ea&s;t and to the South of us a
great Way.</P>
<P>Here we &s;et up twelve little Hutts, like Sol|diers
Tents, but made of the Boughs of Trees
&s;tuck into the Ground, and bound together on
the Top with Withes, and &s;uch other things
as we could get; the Creek was our Defence on
the North, a little Brook on the We&s;t, and
the South and Ea&s;t Sides we fortify'd with a
Bank, which entirely covered our Hutts; and
being drawn oblique from the North We&s;t to
the South Ea&s;t, made our City a Triangle.
Behind the Bank, or Line, our Hutts &s;tood, ha|ving
three other Hutts behind them at a good
Di&s;tance. In one of the&s;e, which was a little one,
and &s;tood further off, we put our Gun-powder,
and nothing el&s;e, for fear of Danger; in the
other, which was bigger, we dre&s;t our Victuals,
and put all our Nece&s;&s;aries; and in the third,
which was bigge&s;t of all, we eat our Dinners,
called our Councils, and &s;at and diverted our
&s;elves with &s;uch Conver&s;ation as we had one
with another, which was but indifferent truly at
that time.</P>
<P>Our Corre&s;pondence with the Natives was ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, and our Arti&s;t, the Cutler,
having made Abundance of tho&s;e little Diamond
cut Squares of Silver, with the&s;e we made Shift
to Traffick with the black People for what we
wanted; for indeed they were plea&s;ed wonder|fully
with them: And thus we got Plenty of
Provi&s;ions. At fir&s;t, and in particular, we got
<PB N="46" REF="48">
about fifty Head of Black Cattel and Goats, and
our Cook's Mate took care to cure them, and dry
them, &s;alt and pre&s;erve them for our grand
Supply; nor was this hard to do, the Salt and
Salt-Petre being very good, and the Sun ex|ce&s;&s;ively
hot; and here we lived about four
Months.</P>
<P>The Southern Sol&s;tice was over, and the Sun
gone back towards the <HI>Equinoctial,</HI> when we con|&s;idered
of our next Adventure, which was to go
over the Sea of <HI>Zanquebar,</HI> as the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
call it, and to land, if po&s;&s;ible, upon the Conti|nent
of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>We talked with many of the Natives about
it, &s;uch as we could make our &s;elves intelligible
to; but all that we could learn from them was,
that there was a great Land of Lions beyond
the Sea, but that it was a great Way off; we
knew as well as they that it was a long Way, but
our People differed mightily about it: Some
&s;aid it was 150 Leagues, others not above
100. One of our Men that had a Map of the
World &s;hewed us by his Scale, that it was
not above 80 Leagues. Some &s;aid there were
I&s;lands all the Way to touch at; &s;ome that there
were no I&s;lands at all: For my Part, I knew
nothing of this Matter one way or another, but
heard it all without Concern, whether it was
near or far off; however, this we learned from
an old Man who was blind, and led about by a
Boy, that if we &s;tay'd till the End of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> we
&s;hould be &s;ure of the Wind to be fair, and the
Sea &s;mooth all the Voyage.</P>
<P>This was &s;ome Encouragement, but &s;taying
again was very unwelcome News to us, becau&s;e
that then the Sun would be returning again
<PB N="47" REF="49">
to the South, which was what our Men were
very unwilling to. At la&s;t we called a Council of
our whole Body; their Debates were too tedi|ous
to take Notice of, only to note, that when it
came to <HI>Captain Bob,</HI> (for &s;o they called me ever
&s;ince I had taken State upon me before one of
their great Princes) truly I was on no Side,
it was not one Farthing Matter to me, I told
them, whether we went or &s;tayed, I had no home,
and all the World was alike to me; &s;o I left it
entirely to them to determine.</P>
<P>In a Word, they &s;aw plainly there was nothing
to be done where we were, without Shipping;
that if our Bu&s;ine&s;s indeed was only to eat and
drink, we could not find a better Place in the
World; but if our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to get away, and
get home into our own Country, we could not
find a Wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I liked the Country wonderfully,
and even then had &s;trange Notions of coming
again to live there; and I u&s;ed to &s;ay to them
very often, that if I had but a Ship of 20 Guns,
and a Sloop, and both well Manned, I would not
de&s;ire a better Place in the World to make my
&s;elf as rich as a King.</P>
<P>But to return to the Con&s;ultations they were
in about going: Upon the whole, it was re&s;olved
to venture over for the Main; and venture we
did, madly enough, indeed; for it was the
wrong time of the Year to undertake &s;uch
a Voyage in that Country; for, as the Winds
hang Ea&s;terly all the Months from <HI>September</HI>
to <HI>March,</HI> &s;o they generally hang We&s;terly all
the re&s;t of the Year, and blew right in our
Teeth, &s;o that as &s;oon as we had, with a kind
of a Land Breeze, &s;tretched over about 15 or 20
<PB N="48" REF="50">
Leagues, and, as I may &s;ay, ju&s;t enough to lo&s;e
our &s;elves, we found the Wind &s;et in a &s;teady
fre&s;h Gale or Breeze from the Sea, at We&s;t
W. S. W. or S. W. by W. and never further
from the We&s;t; &s;o that, in a Word we could
make nothing of it.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Ve&s;&s;el, &s;uch as we had
would not lye clo&s;e upon a Wind; if &s;o, we
might have &s;tretched away N. N. W. and have
met with a great many I&s;lands in our Way, as
we found afterwards; but we could make no|thing
of it, tho' we tried, and by the trying had
almo&s;t undone us all; for, &s;tretching away to
the North, as near the Wind as we could, we
had forgotten the Shape and Po&s;ition of the I&s;land
of <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> it &s;elf; how that we came off at
the Head of a Promontory or Point of Land
that lies about the Middle of the I&s;land, and
that &s;tretches out We&s;t a great way into the Sea;
and that now being run a Matter of 40 Leagues
to the North, the Shore of the I&s;land fell
off again above 200 Miles to the Ea&s;t, &s;o that
we were by this Time in the wide Ocean, be|tween
the I&s;land and the Main, and almo&s;t 100
Leagues from both.</P>
<P>Indeed as the Winds blew fre&s;h at We&s;t, as
before, we had a &s;mooth Sea, and we found it
pretty good going before it, and &s;o taking our
&s;malle&s;t Canoe in Tow, we &s;tood in for the Shore
with all the Sail we could make. This was a
terrible Adventure; for if the lea&s;t Gu&s;t of Wind
had come, we had been all lo&s;t, our Canoes be|ing
deep, and in no Condition to make Way in a
high Sea.</P>
<P>This Voyage, however, held us eleven Days
in all, and at length having &s;pent mo&s;t of our
<PB N="49" REF="51">
Provi&s;ions, and every Drop of Water we had,
we &s;pied Land, to our great Joy, tho' at the Di&s;t|ance
of ten or eleven Leagues, and as under
the Land, the Wind came off like a Land Breeze,
and blew hard again&s;t us, we were two Days
more before we reached the Shore, having
all that while exce&s;&s;ive hot Weather, and not a
Drop of Water, or any other Liquor, except
&s;ome Cordial Waters, which one of our Com|pany
had a little of left in a Ca&s;e of Bottles.</P>
<P>This gave us a Ta&s;te of what we &s;hould have
done, if we had ventured forward with a &s;cant
Wind and uncertain Weather, and gave us a
Surfeit of our De&s;ign for the Main, at lea&s;t 'till we
might have &s;ome better Ve&s;&s;els under us; &s;o
we went on Shore again, and pitched our Camp,
as before, in as convenient Manner as we could,
fortifying our &s;elves again&s;t any Surprize; but
the Natives here were exceeding courteous, and
much civiller than on the South Part of the
I&s;land; and tho' we could not under&s;tand what
they &s;aid, or they us, yet we found Means to
make them under&s;tand that we were Sea-faring
Men, and Strangers; and that we were in Di|&s;tre&s;s
for want of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Proof we had of their Kindne&s;s was,
that, as &s;oon as they &s;aw us come on Shore, and
begin to make our Habitation, one of their Cap|tains
or Kings, for we knew not what to call
them, came down with five or &s;ix Men and &s;ome
Women, and brought us five Goats and two
young fat Steers, and gave them to us for no|thing;
and when we went to offer them any
thing, the Captain, or the King, would not let
any of them touch it, or take any thing of us.
About two Hours after came another King or Cap|tain,
<PB N="50" REF="52">
with forty or fifty Men after him; we
began to be afraid of him, and laid Hands upon
our Weapons; but he perceiving it, cau&s;ed two
Men to go before him carrying two long Poles
in their Hands, which they held upright, as
high as they could, which we pre&s;ently per|ceiv'd
was a Signal of Peace, and the&s;e two Poles
they &s;et up afterwards &s;ticking them up in the
Ground; and when the King and his Men came
to the&s;e two Poles, they &s;tuck all their Lances
up in the Ground, and came on unarmed, lea|ving
their Lances, as al&s;o their Bows and Arrows
behind them.</P>
<P>This was to &s;atisfy us, that they were come as
Friends, and we were very glad to &s;ee it; for
we had no Mind to quarrel with them, if we
could help it. The Captain of this Gang &s;eeing
&s;ome of our Men making up their Hutts, and
that they did it but bunglingly, he becken'd
to &s;ome of his Men to go and help us. Immedia|tely
15 or 16 of them came and mingled a|mong
us, and went to Work for us; and, in|deed,
they were better Workmen than we were,
for they run up three or four Hutts for us
in a Moment, and much hand&s;omer done than
ours.</P>
<P>After this they &s;ent us Milk, Plantanes, Pump|kins,
and Abundance of Roots and Greens that
were very good, and then took their Leave,
and would not take any thing from us that we
had. One of our Men offer'd the King or Captain
of the&s;e Men a Dram, which he drank, and was
mightily plea&s;ed with it, and held out his
Hand for another, which we gave him; and, in
a Word, after this, he hardly failed coming to
us two or three times a Week, always bringing
<PB N="51" REF="53">
us &s;omething or other, and one time &s;ent us &s;even
Head of Black Cattle, &s;ome of which we
cured and dried as before.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but remember one thing'
which afterwards &s;tood us in great &s;tead, <HI>viz.</HI>
that the Fle&s;h of their Goats and their Beef al&s;o,
but e&s;pecially the former, when we had dried
and cured it, looked red, and eat hard and firm,
as dry'd Beef in <HI>Holland;</HI> they were &s;o plea&s;ed
with it, and it was &s;uch a Dainty to them, that
at any time after they would Trade with us
for it, not knowing, or &s;o much as imagining,
what it was; &s;o that for Ten or Twelve Pound
Weight of &s;moked dry'd Beef, they would
give us a whole Bullock, or Cow, or any thing
el&s;e we could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Here we ob&s;erved two Things that were very
material to us, even e&s;&s;entially &s;o; fir&s;t, we
found they had a great deal of Earthen-Ware
here, which they make u&s;e of many ways, as
we did: Particularly they had long deep Earthen
Pots, which they u&s;ed to &s;ink into the Ground
to keep the Water which they drank cool and
plea&s;ant; and the other was, that they had lar|ger
Canoes than their Neighbours had.</P>
<P>By this we were prompted to enquire if they
had no larger Ve&s;&s;els than tho&s;e we &s;aw there;
or if any other of the Inhabitants had not &s;uch.
They &s;ignified pre&s;ently, that they had no larger
Boats than that they &s;hewed us; but that on the
other Side of the I&s;land they had larger Boats,
and that with Decks upon them, and large Sails;
and this made us resolve to Coa&s;t round the
whole I&s;land to &s;ee them; &s;o we prepared and
victualled our Canoe for the Voyage, and, in a
Word, went to Sea for the third time.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54">
It co&s;t us a Month or &s;ix Weeks time to per|form
this Voyage, in which time we went on
Shore &s;everal times for Water and Provi&s;ions, and
found. the Natives always very free and cour|teous;
but we were &s;urprized one Morning early,
being at the Extremity of the Northermo&s;t Part of
the I&s;land, when one of our Men cried out <HI>a Sail,
a Sail:</HI> We pre&s;ently &s;aw a Ve&s;&s;el a great Way
out at Sea; but after we had looked at it with
our Per&s;pective Gla&s;&s;es, and endeavoured all we
could to make out what it was, we could not
tell what to think of it; for it was neither Ship,
Ketch, Gally, Galliot, or like any thing that
we had ever &s;een before: All that we could
make of it was, that it went from us &s;tanding
out to Sea. In a Word, we &s;oon lo&s;t Sight of it,
for we were in no Condition to cha&s;e any thing,
and we never &s;aw it again, but by all we could
perceive of it, from what we &s;aw of &s;uch things
afterwards, it was &s;ome <HI>Arabian</HI> Ve&s;&s;el which
had been trading to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mo&s;ambique,</HI> or
<HI>Zanguebar,</HI> the &s;ame Place where we afterwards
went, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>I kept no Journal of this Voyage, nor indeed
did I all this while under&s;tand any thing of Na|vigation,
more than the common Bu&s;ine&s;s of a
Fore-ma&s;t Man; &s;o I can &s;ay nothing to the La|titudes
or Di&s;tances of any Places we were at,
how long we were going, or how far we &s;ailed
in a Day; but this I remember, that being now
come round the I&s;land, we &s;ailed up the Ea&s;tern
Shore due South, as we had done down the We|&s;tern
Shore due North before.</P>
<P>Nor do I remember that the Natives differed
much from one another, either in Stature or
Complexion, or in their Manners, their Habits
<PB N="53" REF="55">
their Weapons, or indeed in any thing; and yet
we could not perceive that they had any Intelli|gence
one with another; but they were extreme|ly
kind and civil to us on this Side, as well as
on the other.</P>
<P>We continued our Voyage South for many
Weeks, tho' with &s;everal Intervals of going on
Shore to get Provi&s;ions and Water. At length,
coming round a Point of Land which lay about
a League farther than ordinary into the Sea, we
were agreeably &s;urprized with a Sight, which,
no doubt, had been as di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e con|cern'd,
as it was plea&s;ant to us. This was the
Wreck of an <HI>European</HI> Ship, which had been ca&s;t
away upon the Rocks, which in that Place run a
great Way into the Sea.</P>
<P>We could &s;ee plainly at Low Water, a great
deal of the Ship lay dry; even at High Water,
&s;he was not entirely covered; and that at mo&s;t
&s;he did not lye above a League from the Shore.
It will ea&s;ily be believ'd, that our Curio&s;ity led
us, the Wind and Weather al&s;o permitting, to go
directly to her, which we did without any Diffi|culty,
and pre&s;ently found that it was a <HI>Dutch</HI>-built
Ship, and that &s;he could not have been very
long in that Condition, a great deal of the upper
Work of her Stem remaining firm, with the
Mizen Ma&s;t &s;tanding. Her Stern &s;eem'd to be
jaum'd in between two Ridges of the Rock,
and &s;o remained fa&s;t, all the Fore-part of the Ship
having been beaten to Pieces.</P>
<P>We could &s;ee nothing to be gotten out of
the Wreck that was worth our while; but we
re&s;olv'd to go on Shore, and &s;tay &s;ometime there|abouts,
to &s;ee if perhaps we might get any Light
into the Story of her, and we were not without
<PB N="54" REF="56">
Hopes that we might hear &s;omething more parti|cular
about her Men, and perhaps find &s;ome of
them on Shore there, in the &s;ame Condition that
we were in, and &s;o might encrea&s;e our Com|pany.</P>
<P>It was a very plea&s;ant Sight to us, when co|ming
on Shore, we &s;aw all the Marks and To|kens
of a Ship-Carpenter's Yard; as a Launch
Block and Craddles, Scaffolds and Planks, and
Pieces of Planks, the Remains of the Building a
Ship or Ve&s;&s;el; and, in a Word, a great many
things that fairly invited us to go about the
&s;ame Work, and we &s;oon came to under&s;and, that
the Men belonging to the Ship that was lo&s;t, had
&s;aved them&s;elves on Shore, perhaps in their Boat,
and had built them&s;elves a Bark or Sloop, and &s;o
were gone to Sea again; and enquiring of the
Natives which Way they went, they pointed to
the South and South-We&s;t, by which we could
ea&s;ily under&s;tand that they were gone away to the
<HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>No body will imagine we could be &s;o dull as not
to gather from hence, that we might take the
&s;ame Method for our E&s;capes; &s;o we re&s;olved fir&s;t
in general, that we would try, if po&s;&s;ible, to
build us a Boat of one Kind or other, and go
to Sea as our Fate &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>In order to this, our fir&s;t Work was to have
the two Carpenters &s;earch about to &s;ee what Ma|terials
the <HI>Dutchment</HI> had left behind them that
might be of U&s;e; and in particular, they found
one that was very u&s;eful, and which I was much em|ploy'd
about, and that was a Pitch-Kettle, and a
little Pitch in it.</P>
<P>When we came to &s;et clo&s;e to this Work, we
found it very laborious and difficult, having but
<PB N="55" REF="57">
few Tools, no Iron Work, no Cordage, no Sails;
&s;o that, in &s;hort, whatever we built, we were
oblig'd to be our own Smiths, Rope-Makers,
Sail-Makers, and indeed to practi&s;e twenty Trades
that we knew little or nothing of: However, Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
was the Spur to Invention, and we did ma|ny
things which before we thought impracticable,
that is to &s;ay, in our Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>After our two Carpenters had re&s;olved upon
the Dimen&s;ions of what they would build, they
&s;et us all to Work, to go off in our Boats, and
&s;plit up the Wreck of the old Ship, and to bring
away every thing we could; and particularly,
that, if po&s;&s;ible, we &s;hould bring away the Mi|zen
Ma&s;t, which was left &s;anding, which with
much Difficulty we effected, after above twenty
Days Labour of fourteen of our Men.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time we got out a great deal of
Iron-Work; as Bolts, Spikes, Nails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which
our Arti&s;t, of whom I have &s;poken already, who
was now grown a very dexterous Smith, made us
Nails and Hinges for our Rudder, and Spikes
&s;uch as we wanted.</P>
<P>But we wanted an Anchor, and if we had had
an Anchor, we could not have made a Cable;
&s;o we contented our &s;elves with making &s;ome
Ropes with the Help of the Natives, of &s;uch Stuff
as they made their Matts of, and with the&s;e
we made &s;uch a kind of cable or <HI>Tow Line,</HI> as
was &s;ufficient to fa&s;ten our Ve&s;&s;el to the Shore,
which we contented our &s;elves with for that
time.</P>
<P>To be &s;hort, we &s;pent four Months here, and
work'd very hard too; at the End of which
time we launch'd our Frigate, which, in a few
Words, had many Defects, but yet, all things
<PB N="56" REF="58">
con&s;idered, it was as well as we could expect
it to be.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it was a kind of a Sloop, of the
Burthen of near 18 or 20 Ton, and had we
had Ma&s;ts and Sails; &s;tanding, and running Rig|ging,
as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and other Con|veniences,
the Ve&s;&s;el might have carry'd us
wherever we could have had a Mind to go; but
of all the Materials we wanted, this was the
wor&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that we had no Tar or Pitch to pay the
Seams, and &s;ecure the Bottom; and tho' we did
what we could with Tallow and Oil, to make
a Mixture to &s;upply that Part, yet we could not
bring it to an&s;wer our End fully; and when
we launch'd her into the Water, &s;he was &s;o
leaky, and took in the Water &s;o fa&s;t, that we
thought all our Labour had been lo&s;t, for we
had much ado to make her &s;wim; and as for
Pumps, we had none, nor had we any Means
to make one.</P>
<P>But at length one of the Natives, a black
<HI>Negro-man,</HI> &s;hewed us a Tree, the Wood of which
being put into the Fire, &s;ends forch a Liquid
that is as glutinous, and almo&s;t as &s;trong as Tar,
and of which, by boiling, we made a Sort of
Stuff which &s;erv'd us for Pitch, and this an&s;we|red
our End effectually; for we perfectly made
our Ve&s;&s;el &s;ound and tight, &s;o that we wanted no
Pitch or Tar at all. This Secret has &s;tood me
in &s;tead upon many Occa&s;ions &s;ince that time,
in the &s;ame Place.</P>
<P>Our Ve&s;&s;el being thus fini&s;hed, out of the Mi|zen
Ma&s;t of the Ship, we made a very good
Ma&s;t to her, and fitted our Sails to it as well as
we could; then we made a Rudder and Tiller;
and, in a Word, every thing that our pre&s;ent
<PB N="57" REF="59">
Nece&s;&s;ity called upon us for; and having victu|alled
her, and put as much fre&s;h Water on Board
as we thought we wanted, or as we knew how
to &s;tow (for we were yet without Casks) we put
to Sea with a fair Wind.</P>
<P>We had &s;pent near another Year in the&s;e
Rambles, and in this Piece of Work; for it was
now, as our Men &s;aid, about the Beginning of
our <HI>February,</HI> and the Sun went from us apace,
which was much to our Satisfaction, for the
Heats were exceeding violent. The Wind, as
I &s;aid, was fair, for as I have &s;ince learnt, the
Winds generally &s;pring up to the Ea&s;tward, as
the Sun goes from them to the North.</P>
<P>Our Debate now was, which Way we &s;hould
go, and never were Men &s;o irre&s;olute; &s;ome were
for going to the Ea&s;t, and &s;tretching away dire|ctly
for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar;</HI> but others who
con&s;idered more &s;eriou&s;ly the Length of that Voy|age,
&s;hook their Heads at the Propo&s;al, knowing
very well, that neither out Provi&s;ions, e&s;pecially
of Water; or our Ve&s;&s;el, were equal to &s;uch a
Run as that is, of near 2000 Miles, without
any Land to touch at in the Way.</P>
<P>The&s;e Men too had all along had a great
Mind to a Voyage for the main Land of <HI>Africk,</HI>
where they &s;aid we &s;hould have a fair Ca&s;t for
our Lives, and might be &s;ure to make our &s;elves
rich which Way &s;oever we went, if we were but
able to$ make our Way through, whether by Sea
or by Land.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as the Ca&s;e &s;tood with us, we had
not much Choice for our Way; for if we had
re&s;olv'd for the Ea&s;t, we were at the wrong Sea|&s;on
of the Year, and mu&s;t have &s;taid till <HI>April</HI> or
<HI>May</HI> before we had gone to Sea. At length, as
<PB N="58" REF="60">
we had the Wind at S. E. and E. S. E. and fine
promi&s;ing Weather, we came all into the fir&s;t
Propo&s;al, and re&s;olved for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa;</HI>
nor were we long in di&s;puting as to our Coa&s;t|ing
the I&s;land, which we were upon; for we
were now on the wrong Side of the I&s;land for
the Voyage we intended; So we &s;tood away to
the North, and having rounded the Cape, we
hall'd away Southward under the Lee of the
I&s;land, thinking to reach the We&s;t Point of Land,
which, as I ob&s;erved before, runs out &s;o far
towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> as would have &s;hor|ten'd
our Run almo&s;t 100 Leagues. But when
we had &s;ailed about thirty Leagues, we found
the Winds variable under the Shore, and right
again&s;t us; &s;o we concluded to &s;tand over di|rectly,
for then we had the Wind fair, and our
Ve&s;&s;el was but very ill fitted to lye near the
Wind, or any Way indeed but ju&s;t afore it.</P>
<P>Having re&s;olv'd upon it therefore, we put
in to the Shore, to furni&s;h our &s;elves again
with fre&s;h Water and other Provi&s;ions, and about
the latter End of <HI>March,</HI> with more Courage than
Di&s;cretion, more Re&s;olution than Judgement, we
launch'd for the main Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>As for me, I had no Anxieties about it; &s;o that
we had but a View of reaching &s;ome Land or
other, I cared not what or where it was to be,
having at this time no Views of what was before
me, nor much Thought of what might, or might
not befal me; but with as little Con&s;ideration as
any one can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have at my Age, I
con&s;ented to every thing that was propo&s;ed,
however hazardous the thing it &s;elf, however
improbable the Succe&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">
The Voyage, as it was undertaken with a great
deal of Ignorance and De&s;peration, &s;o really it
was not carry'd on with much Re&s;olution or
Judgment; for we knew no more of the Cour&s;e
we were to &s;teer, than this, that it was any
where about the We&s;t, within two or three
Points N. or S. and as we had no Compa&s;s with
us, but a little Bra&s;s Pocket Compa&s;s, which one
of our Men had more by Accident than other|wi&s;e,
&s;o we could not be very exact in our
Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>However, as it plea&s;ed God that the Wind
continued fair at S. E. and by E. we found that
N. W. by W. which was right afore it, was as
good a Cour&s;e for us as any we could go, and
thus we went on.</P>
<P>The Voyage was much longer than we expe|cted;
our Ve&s;&s;el al&s;o, which had no Sail that
was proportion'd to her, made but very little
Way in the Sea, and &s;ail'd heavily. We had
indeed no great Adventures happen'd in this
Voyage, being out of the Way of every thing
that could offer to divert us; and as for &s;eeing
any Ve&s;&s;el, we had not the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion to hail
any thing in all the Voyage; for we &s;aw not
one Ve&s;&s;el &s;mall or great, the Sea we were upon
being entirely out of the way of all Commerce;
for the People of <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> knew no more of
the Shores of <HI>Africa</HI> than we did, only that
there was a Country of Lions, as they call <HI>it,
that Way.</HI></P>
<P>We had been eight or nine Days under Sail,
with a fair Wind, when, to our great Joy one
of our Men cry'd out, <HI>Land.</HI> We had great
Rea&s;on to be glad of the Di&s;covery; for we had
not Water enough left for above two or three
<PB N="60" REF="62">
Days more, tho' at a &s;hort Allowance. Howe|ver,
tho' it was early in the Morning when we
di&s;cover'd it, we made it near Night before we
reach'd it, the Wind &s;lackening almo&s;t to a Calm,
and our Ship being, as I &s;aid, a very dull Sailer.</P>
<P>We were &s;adly baulk'd upon our coming to the
Land, when we found, that in&s;tead of the main
Land of <HI>Africk,</HI> it was only a little I&s;tand, with
no Inhabitants upon it, at lea&s;t, none that we
could find; nor any Cattel, except a few Goats,
of which we killed three only. However, they
&s;erved us for fre&s;h Meat, and we found very
good Water; and it was fifteen Days more be|fore
we reach'd the Main, which, however, at
la&s;t we arriv'd at; and which was mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial
to us, we came to it ju&s;t as all our Provi|&s;ions
were &s;pent. Indeed we may &s;ay they were
&s;pent fir&s;t; for we had but a Pint of Water a
Day to each Man for the la&s;t two Days. But
to our great Joy, we &s;aw the Land, tho' at a great
Di&s;tance, the Evening before, and by a plea&s;ant
Gale in the Night, were, by Morning, within
two Leagues of the Shore.</P>
<P>We never &s;crupled going a&s;hore at the fir&s;t
Place we came at, tho' had we had Patience,
we might have found a very fine River a little
farther North. However, we kept our Frigate
on Float by the Help of two great Poles which
we fa&s;ten'd into the Ground to <HI>More</HI> her, like
Piles; and the little weak Ropes, which, as I &s;aid,
we had made of Matting, &s;erved us well enough
to make the Ve&s;&s;el fa&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had viewed the Country a little,
got fre&s;h Water, and furni&s;hed our &s;elves with &s;ome
Victuals, which we found very &s;carce here, we
went onboard again withour Stores. All we got for
<PB N="61" REF="63">
Provi&s;ion, was &s;ome Fowls that we killed, and a
kind of wild Buffloe, or Bull, very &s;mall, but good
Meat: I &s;ay, having got the&s;e things on Board,
we re&s;olved to &s;ail on along the Coa&s;t, which lay
away N. N. E. till we found &s;ome Creek or River
that we might run up into the Country, or &s;ome
Town or People; for we had Rea&s;on enough to
know the Place was inhabited, becau&s;e we &s;eve|ral
times &s;aw Fires in the Night, and Smoke in
the Day, every way at a Di&s;tance from us.</P>
<P>At length we came to a very large Bay, and in
it &s;everal little Creeks or Rivers emptying them|&s;elves
into the Sea, and we run boldly into the
fir&s;t Creek we came at; where &s;eeing &s;ome Hutts
and wild People about them, on the Shore, we run
our Ve&s;&s;el into a little Cove on the North Side
of the Creek, and held up a long Pole with a
white Bit of Cloath on it, for a Signal of Peace
to them. We found they under&s;tood us pre|&s;ently,
for they came flocking to us both Men,
Women, and Children, mo&s;t of them of both
Sexes &s;tark naked. At fir&s;t they &s;tood wondering
and &s;taring at us, as if we had been Mon&s;ters,
and as if they had been frighted; but we found
they inclined to be familiar with us afterwards.
The fir&s;t thing we did to try them, was, we
held up our Hands to our Mouths, as if we were
to drink, &s;ignifying that we wanted Water. This
they under&s;tood pre&s;ently, and three of their
Women and two Boys ran away up the Land, and
came back in about Half a Quarter of an Hour,
with &s;everal Pots made of Earth pretty enough,
and bak'd, I &s;uppo&s;e, in the Sun; the&s;e they
brought us full of Water, and &s;et them down
near the Sea-&s;hore, and there left them, go|ing
<PB N="62" REF="64">
back a little, that we might fetch them,
which we did.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, they brought us Roots
and Herbs, and &s;ome Fruits which I cannot re|member,
and gave us; but as we had nothing to
give them, we found them not &s;o free as the
people in <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> were. However, our Cut|ler
went to Work, and as he had &s;aved &s;ome Iron
out of the Wreck of the Ship, he made Abun|dance
of Toys, Birds, Dogs, Pins, Hooks, and
Rings, and we helped to file them, and make
them bright for him; and when we gave them
&s;ome of the&s;e, they brought us all the Sorts of
Provi&s;ions they had, &s;uch as Goats, Hogs, and
Cows, and we got Victuals enough.</P>
<P>We were now landed upon the Continent of
<HI>Africa,</HI> the mo&s;t de&s;olate, de&s;art, and unho&s;pita|ble
Country in the World, even <HI>Greenland</HI> and
<HI>Nova Zembla</HI> it &s;elf not excepted; with this
Difference only, that even the wor&s;t Part of it
we found inhabited; tho' taking the Nature and
Quality of &s;ome of the Inhabitants, it might
have been much better to us if there had been
none.</P>
<P>And, to add to the Exclamation I am making
on the Nature of the Place, it was here, that we
took one of the ra&s;he&s;t and wilde&s;t, and mo&s;t
de&s;perate Re&s;olutions that ever was taken by
Man, or any Number of Men, in the World;
this was, to travel over Land through the Heart
of the Country, from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mozambique,</HI>
on the Ea&s;t-Ocean to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Angola</HI> or <HI>Gui|nea,</HI>
on the We&s;tern or <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, a Con|tinent
of Land of at lea&s;t 1800 Miles; in which
Journey we had exce&s;&s;ive Heats to &s;upport, un|pa&s;&s;able
De&s;arts to go over, no Carriages, Camels
<PB N="63" REF="65">
or Bea&s;ts of any kind to carry our Baggage,
innumerable Numbers of wild and ravenous
Bea&s;ts to encounter with, &s;uch as Lions, Leo|pards,
Tigers, Lizards, and Elephants; we had
the Equinoctial Line to pa&s;s under, and con&s;e|quently
were in the very Center of the Tor|rid
Zone; we had Nations of Savages to en|counter
with, barbarous and bruti&s;h to the la&s;t
Degree, Hunger and Thir&s;t to &s;truggle with;
and, in one Word, Terrors enough to have
daunted the &s;toute&s;t Hearts that ever were placed
in Ca&s;es of Fle&s;h and Blood.</P>
<P>Yet, fearle&s;s of all the&s;e, we re&s;olved to ad|venture,
and accordingly made &s;uch Preparation
for our Journey, as the Place we were in
would allow us, and &s;uch as our little Experience
of the Country &s;eem'd to dictate to us.</P>
<P>It had been &s;ome time already that we had
been u&s;ed to tread bare-footed upon the Rocks,
the Gravel, the Gra&s;s and the Sand on the Shore;
but as we found the wor&s;t thing for our Feet
was, the walking or travelling on the dry burn|ing
Sands, within the Country; &s;o we provided
our &s;elves with a &s;ort of Shoes made of the Skins
of Wild Bea&s;ts, with the Hair inward, and being
dryed in the Sun, the Out-&s;ide were thick and
hard, and would la&s;t a great while. In &s;hort,
as I called them, &s;o I think the Term very pro|per
&s;till, we made us Gloves for our Feet,
and we found them very convenient and very
comfortable.</P>
<P>We conver&s;ed with &s;ome of the Natives of
the Country who were friendly enough. What
Tongue they &s;poke, I do not yet pretend to
know. We talked as far as we could make them
under&s;tand us, not only about our Provi&s;ions,
<PB N="64" REF="66">
but al&s;o about our Undertaking; and ask'd them
what Country lay that Way, pointing We&s;t with
our Hands. They told us but little to our Pur|po&s;e,
only we thought by all their Di&s;cour&s;e, that
there were People to be found of one Sort or
other every where; that there were many great
Rivers, many Lions and Tygers, Elephants, and
furious wild Cats (which in the End we found to
be Civet Cats) and the like.</P>
<P>When we ask'd them, if any one had ever tra|velled
that Way, they told us Yes, &s;ome had
gone to where the Sun &s;leeps, meaning to the
We&s;t; but they could not tell us who they were.
When we ask'd for &s;ome to guide us, they &s;hrunk
up their Shoulders as <HI>Frenchmen</HI> do when they are
afraid to undertake a thing. When we ask'd
them about the Lions and wild Creatures they
laught, and let us know they would do us no
Hurt, and directed us to a good way indeed to
deal with them, and that was to make &s;ome Fire,
which would always fright them away, and &s;o
indeed we found it.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Encouragements we re&s;olved upon
our Journey, and many Con&s;iderations put us
upon it, which, had the thing it &s;elf been pra|cticable,
we were not &s;o much to blame for,
as it might otherwi&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed; I'll name &s;ome
of them, not to make the Account too tedious.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We were perfectly de&s;titute of Means
to work about our own Deliverance any
other way; we were on &s;hore in a Place perfect|ly
remote from all <HI>European</HI> Navigation; &s;o that
we could never think of being relieved, and
fetch'd off by any of our own Country-men in
that Part of the World. Secondly, If we had
adventured to have &s;ailed on along the Coa&s;t of
<PB N="65" REF="67">
<HI>Mozambique,</HI> and the de&s;olate Shores of <HI>Africa</HI> to
the North, till we came to the Red Sea, all we
could hope for there, was to be taken by the
<HI>Arabs,</HI> and be &s;old for Slaves to the <HI>Turks,</HI> which
to all of us was little better than Death. We
could not build any thing of a Ve&s;&s;el that
would carry us over the great <HI>Arabian</HI> Sea
to <HI>India,</HI> nor could we reach the Cape <HI>de Bona
Speranza,</HI> the Winds being too variable, and the
Sea in that Latitude too tempe&s;tuous; but we all
knew, if we could cro&s;s this Continent of Land,
we might reach &s;ome of the great Rivers that
run into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and that on the
Banks of any of tho&s;e Rivers we might
there build us Canoes which would carry us
down, if it were Thou&s;ands of Miles; &s;o that
we could want nothing but Food, of which we
were a&s;&s;ured we might kill &s;ufficient with our
Guns: And, to add to the Satisfaction of our
Deliverance, we concluded we might every one
of us get a Quantity of Gold, which, if we came
&s;afe, would infinitely recompence us for our Toil.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, that in all our Con&s;ultations I
ever began to enter into the Weight and Merit
of any Enterprize we went upon till now. My
View before was, as I thought, very good, <HI>viz.</HI>
that we &s;hould get into the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph,
or the Mouth of the Red Sea, and waiting for
&s;ome Ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ing, or repa&s;&s;ing there, of which
there is Plenty, have &s;eized upon the fir&s;t
we came at, by Force, and not only have
enriched our &s;elves with her Cargo, but have
carried our &s;elves to what Part of the World we
had plea&s;ed: But when they came to talk to
me of a March of 2 or 3000 Miles on Foot, of
Wandering in De&s;arts, among Lions and Tygers,
<PB N="66" REF="68">
I confe&s;s my Blood run chill, and I u&s;ed all the
Arguments I could to per&s;wade them again&s;t it.</P>
<P>But they were all po&s;itive, and I might as
well have held my Tongue; &s;o I &s;ubmitted, and
told them, I would keep to our fir&s;t Law, to be
governed by the Majority, and we re&s;olved upon
our Journey. The fir&s;t thing we did, was to
take an Ob&s;ervation, and &s;ee whereabouts in
the World we were, which we did, and found
we were in the Latitude of 12 Degrees, 35
Minutes South of the Line. The next thing was
to look on the Charts, and &s;ee the Coa&s;t of
the Country we aimed at, which we found to
be from 8 to 11 Degrees South Latitude,
if we went for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Angola,</HI> or in 12
to 19 Degrees North Latitude, if we made for
the River <HI>Niger,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiney.</HI></P>
<P>Our Aim was for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Angola,</HI> which
by the Charts we had, lying very near the &s;ame
Latitude we were then in, our Cour&s;e thither
was due We&s;t; and as we were a&s;&s;ured we
&s;hould meet with Rivers, we doubted not, but
that by their Help we might ea&s;e our Journey,
e&s;pecially if we could find Means to cro&s;s the
great Lake, or Inland Sea, which the Natives
call <HI>Coalmucoa,</HI> out of which it is &s;aid the River
<HI>Nile</HI> has its Source or Beginning; but we reck|oned
without our Ho&s;t, as you will &s;ee in the
Sequel of our Story.</P>
<P>The next thing we had to con&s;ider was, how
to carry our Baggage, which we were fir&s;t of all
determined not to travel without; neither indeed
was it po&s;&s;ible for us to do &s;o, for even our Am|munition
which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to us,
and on which our Sub&s;i&s;tence, I mean for Food, as
well as our Safety; and particularly our Defence
<PB N="67" REF="69">
again&s;t wild Bea&s;ts, and wild Men depended: I &s;ay,
even our Ammunition was a Load too heavy for
us to carry in a Country where the Heat were
&s;uch, that we &s;hould be Load enough for our &s;elves</P>
<P>We enquired in the Country, and found there
was no Bea&s;t of Burthen known among them;
that is to &s;ay, neither Hor&s;es or Mules or A&s;&s;es,
Camels or Dromedaries; the only Creature they
had, was a kind of Buffloe, or tame Bull, &s;uch a
one as we had killed; and that &s;ome of the&s;e they
had brought &s;o to their Hand, that they taught
them to go and come with their Voices, as they
called them to them, or &s;ent them from them;
that they made them carry Burthens, and parti|cularly,
that they would &s;wim over Rivers
and Lakes upon them, the Creatures &s;wimming
very high and &s;trong in the Water.</P>
<P>But we under&s;tood nothing of the Manage|ment
or Guiding &s;uch a Creature, or how to bind
a Burthen upon them; and this la&s;t Part of
our Con&s;ultation puzzled us extremely: At la&s;t
I propo&s;ed a Method for them, which after
&s;ome Con&s;ideration, they found very conveni|ent;
and this was to quarrel with &s;ome of the
Negro Natives, take ten or twelve of them
Pri&s;oners, and binding them as Slaves, cau&s;e
them to travel with us, and make them car|ry
our Baggage; which I alledged would be
convenient and u&s;eful many ways, as well to
&s;hew us the Way, as to conver&s;e with other
Natives for us.</P>
<P>This Coun&s;el was not accepted at fir&s;t, but
the Natives &s;oon gave them Rea&s;on to approve
it; and al&s;o gave them an Opportunity to put
it in Practice; for as our little Traffick with
the Natives was hitherto upon the Faith of
their fir&s;t Kindne&s;s, we found &s;ome Knavery
<PB N="68" REF="70">
among them at la&s;t; for having bought &s;ome
Cattel of them for our Toys, which, as I &s;aid,
our Cutler had contrived, one of our Men
differing with his Chapman, truly they huff'd
him in their Manner, and keeping the things
he had offered them for the Cattel, made their
Fellows drive away the Cattel before his
Face, and laugh at him; our Man crying out
loud of this Violence, and calling to &s;ome of us,
who were not far off, the Negro he was dealing
with threw a Lance at him, which came &s;o
true, that if he had not with great Agility
jumped a&s;ide, and held up his Hand al&s;o to
turn the Lance as it came, it had &s;truck through
his Body, and, as it was, it wounded him in
the Arm; at which the Man enraged took up
his Fuzee, and &s;hot the Negro through the
Heart.</P>
<P>The others that were near him, and all tho&s;e
that were with us at a Di&s;tance, were &s;o ter|ribly
frighted; fir&s;t, at the Fla&s;h of Fire; &s;e|condly,
at the Noi&s;e: And thirdly, at &s;ee|ing
their Countryman killed, that they &s;tood
like Men &s;tupid and amazed, at fir&s;t, for &s;ome
time: But after they were a little recovered
from their Fright, one of them, at a good Di|&s;tance
from us, &s;et up a &s;udden &s;creaming Noi&s;e,
which, it &s;eems, is the Noi&s;e they make when
they go to Fight; and all the re&s;t under&s;tanding
what he meant, an&s;wered him, and run to|gether
to the Place where he was, and we not
knowing what it meant, &s;tood &s;till looking upon
one another like a Parcel of Fools.</P>
<P>But we were pre&s;ently undeceived, for in
two or three Minutes more we heard the &s;cream|ing
roaring Noi&s;e go on from one Place to a|nother,
through all their little Towns; nay,
<PB N="69" REF="71">
even over the Creek to the other Side; and, on
a &s;udden we &s;aw a naked Multitude running
from all Parts to the Place where the fir&s;t Man
began it, as to a Rendezvous; and, in le&s;s than
an Hour, I believe there was near 500 of them
gotten together, armed &s;ome with Bows and
Arrows, but mo&s;t with Lances, with which they
throw, at a good Di&s;tance, &s;o nicely, that they
will &s;trike a Bird flying.</P>
<P>We had but a very little time for Con&s;ultation,
for the Multitude was encrea&s;ing every Mo|ment;
and I verily believe, if we had &s;tay'd long,
they would have been 10000 together in a lit|tle
time. We had nothing to do therefore, but
to fly to our Ship or Bark, where indeed we
could have defended our &s;elves very well, or
to advance and try what a Volley or two of
&s;mall Shot would do for us.</P>
<P>We re&s;olved immediately upon the latter, de|pending
upon it, that the Fire and Terror of
our Shot would &s;oon put them to Flight; &s;o
we drew up all in a Line, and marched boldly
up to them; they &s;tood ready to meet us, de|pending,
I &s;uppo&s;e, to de&s;troy us all with their
Lances; but before we came near enough for
them to throw their Lances, we halted, and &s;tand|ing
at a good Di&s;tance from one another, to
&s;tretch our Line as far as we could, we gave
them a Salute with our Shot, which be&s;ides what
we wounded that we knew not of, knocked
&s;ixteen of them down upon the Spot, and
three more were &s;o lamed, that they fell about
20 or 30 Yards from them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had fired, they &s;et up the hor|ride&s;t
Yell, or Howling, partly rai&s;ed by tho&s;e
that were wounded, and partly by tho&s;e that
<PB N="70" REF="72">
pitied and condoled the Bodies they &s;aw lye
dead, that I never heard any thing like it be|fore
or &s;ince.</P>
<P>We &s;tood Stock &s;till after we had fired, to
load our Guns again, and finding they did not
&s;tir from the Place, we fired among them again;
we killed about nine of them at the &s;econd Fire;
but as they did not &s;tand &s;o thick as before, all
our Men did not fire, &s;even of us being or|dered
to re&s;erve our Charge, and to advance as
&s;oon as the other had fired, while the re&s;t loaded
again; of which I &s;hall &s;peak again pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had fired the &s;econd Volley we
&s;houted as loud as we could, and the &s;even Men
advanced upon them, and, coming about 20 Yards
nearer, fired again, and tho&s;e that were behind
having loaded again, with all Expedition, fol|low'd
but when they &s;aw us advance, they run
&s;creaming away as if they were bewitched.</P>
<P>When we came up to the Field of Battle, we
&s;aw a great Number of Bodies lying upon the
Ground, many more than we could &s;uppo&s;e were
killed or wounded, nay more than we had Bul|lets
in our Pieces when we fired; and we could
not tell what to make of it; but at length, we
found how it was <HI>viz.</HI> that they were frighted
out of all manner of Sen&s;e; nay, I do believe &s;e|veral
of tho&s;e that were really dead, were frighted
to Death, and had no Wound about them.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e that were thus frighted, as I have &s;aid,
&s;everal of them, as they recovered them&s;elves,
came and wor&s;hipped us (taking us for Gods
or Devils, I know not which, nor did it much
matter to us) &s;ome kneeling, &s;ome throwing
them&s;elves flat on the Ground, made a Thou&s;and
antick Ge&s;tures, but all with Tokens of the mo&s;t
<PB N="71" REF="73">
profound Submi&s;&s;ion. It pre&s;ently came into my
Head, that we might now by the Law of Arms
take as many Pri&s;oners as we would, and make
them travel with us, and carry our Baggage:
As &s;oon as I propo&s;ed it, our Men were all of my
Mind; and accordingly we &s;ecured about 60 lu&s;ty
young Fellows, and let them know they mu&s;t
go with us; which they &s;eemed very willing to
do: But the next Que&s;tion we had among our
&s;elves, was, how we &s;hould do to tru&s;t them, for
we found the People not like tho&s;e of <HI>Madaga&s;ar,</HI>
but fierce, revengful and treacherous, for which
Rea&s;on we were &s;ure, that we &s;hould have no
Service from them but that of meer Slaves, no
Subjection that would continue any longer than
the Fear of us was upon them, nor any Labour
but by Violence.</P>
<P>Before I go any farther, I mu&s;t hint to the
Reader, that from this time forward I began to
enter a little more &s;eriou&s;ly into the Circum|&s;tance
I was in, and concern'd my &s;elf more in
the Conduct of our Affairs; for, tho' my Come|rades
were all older Men, yet I began to find them
void of Coun&s;el, or, as I now call it, Pre&s;ence of
Mind, when, they came to the Execution of a
thing. The fir&s;t Occa&s;ion I took to ob&s;erve this,
was in their late Engagement with the Natives,
when, tho' they had taken a good Re&s;olution to
attack them, and fire upon them, yet when
they had fired the fir&s;t time, and found that the
Negroes did not run as they expected, their
Hearts began to fail, and I am per&s;waded if their
Bark had been near Hand, they would every
Man have run away.</P>
<P>Upon this Occa&s;ion, I began to take upon
me a little to hearten them up, and to call upon
<PB N="72" REF="74">
them to load again, and give them another Volley,
telling them that I would engage, if they would be
ruled by me, I'd make the Negroes run fa&s;t enough.
I found this heartned them, and therefore, when
they fired a &s;econd time, I de&s;ired them to re|&s;erve
&s;ome of their Shot to an Attempt by it
&s;elf, as I mentioned above.</P>
<P>Having fired a &s;econd time, I was indeed for|ced
to command, as I may call it. Now, <HI>Seigniors,</HI>
&s;aid I, let us give them a Chear; &s;o I open'd my
Throat, and &s;houted three times, as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Sailors do on like Occa&s;ions; and now follow me,
&s;aid I to the &s;even that had not fired, and <HI>I'll warrant
you we will make Work with them;</HI> and &s;o it proved
indeed: For as &s;oon as they &s;aw us coming, away
they run as above.</P>
<P>From this Day forward they would call me no|thing
but <HI>Seignior Capitanio;</HI> but I told them, I
would not be called <HI>Seignior.</HI> Well then, &s;aid
the Gunner, who &s;poke good <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> you &s;hall
be called Captain <HI>Bob,</HI> and &s;o they gave me my
Title ever after.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> than
this, take them nationally or per&s;onally; if
they are animated and hearten'd up by any body
to go before, and encourage them by Example,
they will behave well enough; but if they have
nothing but their own Mea&s;ures to follow, they
&s;ink immediately: The&s;e Men had certainly
fled from a Parcel of naked Savages, tho' even
by flying they could not have &s;aved their Lives,
if I had not &s;houted and halloo'd, and made ra|ther
Sport with the thing, than a Fight, to keep
up their Courage.</P>
<P>Nor was there le&s;s need of it upon &s;everal
Occa&s;ions hereafter; and I do confe&s;s, I have of|ten
<PB N="73" REF="75">
wonder'd how a Number of Men, who, when
they came to the Extremity, were &s;o ill &s;uppor|ted
by their own Spirits, had at fir&s;t Courage
to propo&s;e, and to undertake the mo&s;t de&s;perate
and impracticable Attempt that ever Men went
about in the World.</P>
<P>There were indeed two or three indefatigable
Men among them, by who&s;e Courage and Indu|&s;try
all the re&s;t were upheld; and indeed tho&s;e
two or three were the Managers of them from the
Beginning; that was the Gunner, and that Cutler
whom I call the Arti&s;t; and the third, who was
pretty well, tho' not like either of them, was one
of the Carpenters. The&s;e indeed were the Life
and Soul of all the re&s;t, and it was to their Cou|rage
that all the re&s;t ow'd the Re&s;olution they
&s;hewd upon any Occa&s;ion. But when tho&s;e &s;aw
me take a little upon me, as above, they em|braced
me, and treated me with particular Af|fection
ever after.</P>
<P>This Gunner was an excellent Mathematici|an,
a good Scholar, and a compleat Sailor; and
it was in conver&s;ing intimately with him, that
I learnt afterwards the Grounds of what Know|ledge
I have &s;ince had in all the Sciences u&s;eful
for Navigation, and particularly in the Geogra|phical
Part of Knowledge.</P>
<P>Even in our Conver&s;ation, finding me eager
to under&s;tand and learn, he laid the Foundation of
a general Knowledge of things in my Mind, gave
me ju&s;t Ideas of the Form of the Earth and of
the Sea, the Situation of Countries, the Cour&s;e
of Rivers, the Doctrine of the Spheres, the Mo|tion
of the Stars; and, in a Word, taught me a
kind of Sy&s;tem of A&s;tronomy, which I after|wards
improv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">
In e&s;pecial Manner, he filled my Head with
a&s;piring Thoughts, and with an earne&s;t De&s;ire
after learning every thing that could be taught
me; convincing me, that nothing could qualify
me for great Undertakings, but a Degree of
Learning &s;uperior to what was u&s;ual in the Race
of Seamen; he told me, that to be ignorant, was
to be certain of a mean Station in the World, but
that Knowledge was the fir&s;t Step to Preferment.
He was always flattering me with my Capaci|ty
to Learn; and tho' that fed my Pride, yet
on the other Hand, as I had a &s;ecret Ambition
which ju&s;t at that time fed it &s;elf in my Mind,
it prompted in me an in&s;atiable Thir&s;t after
Learning in general, and I re&s;olved, if ever I
came back to <HI>Europe,</HI> and had any thing left to
purcha&s;e it, I would make my &s;elf Ma&s;ter of all
the Parts of Learning needful to the making of
me a compleat Sailor; but I was not &s;o ju&s;t to my
&s;elf afterwards, as to do it when I had an Op|portunity.</P>
<P>But to return to our Bu&s;ine&s;s; the Gunner,
when he &s;aw the Service I had done in the Fight,
and heard my Propo&s;al for keeping a Number
of Pri&s;oners for our March, and for carrying
our Baggage, turns to me before them all, Cap|tain
<HI>Bob, &s;ays he,</HI> I think you mu&s;t be our Lea|der,
for all the Succe&s;s of this Enterprize is
owing to you. <HI>No, no, &s;aid I,</HI> do not compliment
me, you &s;hall be our <HI>Seignior Capitanio,</HI> you &s;hall
be <HI>General,</HI> I am too young for it; &s;o in &s;hort,
we all agreed he &s;hould be our Leader; but he
would not accept of it alone, but would have
me join'd with him, and all the re&s;t agreeing, I
was oblig'd to comply.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
The fir&s;t Piece of Service they put me up|on
in this new Command, was as difficult as
any they could think of, and that was to ma|nage
the Pri&s;oners; which however I chearfully
undertook, as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently: But the
immediate Con&s;ultation was yet of more Con&s;e|quence;
and that was, <HI>First,</HI> Which Way we
&s;hould go, and <HI>Secondly,</HI> How to furni&s;h our &s;elves
for the Voyage with Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>There was among the Pri&s;oners one tall, well-&s;hap'd,
hand&s;om Fellow, to whom the re&s;t &s;eem'd
to pay great Re&s;pect, and who, as we under&s;tood
afterwards, was the Son of one their Kings, his
Father was, it &s;eems, killed at our fir&s;t Volley,
and he wounded with a Shot in his Arm, and
with another ju&s;t on one of his Hips or Haun|ches.
The Shot in his Haunch being in a fle&s;hy
Part, bled much, and he was half dead with
the Lo&s;s of Blood. As to the Shot in his Arm,
it had broke his Wri&s;t, and he was by both
the&s;e Wounds quite di&s;abled, &s;o that we were once
going to turn him away, and let him die; and
if we had, he would have died indeed in a few
Days more: But as I found the Man had &s;ome
Re&s;pect &s;hew'd him, it pre&s;ently occurred to my
Thoughts, that we might bring him to be u&s;eful
to us, and perhaps make him a kind of Com|mander
over them. So I cau&s;ed our Surgeon to
take him in Hand, and gave the poor Wretch
good Words, that is to &s;ay, I &s;poke to him as well
as I could by Signs, to make him under&s;tand that
we would make him well again.</P>
<P>This created a new Awe in their Minds of us,
believing that as we could kill at a Di&s;tance by
&s;omething invi&s;ible to them (for &s;o our Shot was
to be &s;ure) &s;o we could make them well again
<PB N="76" REF="78">
too. Upon this the young Prince (for &s;o we
called him afterwards) called &s;ix or &s;even of the
Savages to him, and &s;aid &s;omething to them;
what it was we knew not, but immediately
all the &s;even came to me, and kneel'd down
to me, holding up their Hands, and making
Signs of Entreaty, pointing to the Place where
one of tho&s;e lay whom we had killed.</P>
<P>It was a long time before I or any of us could
under&s;tand them; but one of them run and lifted
up a dead Man, pointing to his Wound, which
was in his Eye, for he was &s;hot into the Head at
one of his Eyes. Then another pointed to the
Surgeon, and at la&s;t we found it out, that the
Meaning was, that he &s;hould heal the Prince's
Father too, who was dead, being &s;hot thro' the
Head, as above.</P>
<P>We pre&s;ently took the Hint, and would not
&s;ay we could not do it, but let them know, the
Men that were kill'd were tho&s;e that had fir&s;t
fallen upon us, and provoked us, and we would by
no Means make them alive again; and that if any
other did &s;o, we would kill them too, and never
let them live any more: But that if he (the Prince)
would be willing to go with us, and do as we
&s;hould direct him, we would not let him dye, and
would make his Arm well. Upon this he bid his
Men go and fetch a long Stick or Staff, and lay
on the Ground. When they brought it, we &s;aw
it was an Arrow; he took it with his left Hand,
(for his other was lame with the Wound) and
pointing up at the Sun, broke the Arrow in two,
and &s;et the Point again&s;t his Brea&s;t, and then
gave it to me. This was as I under&s;tood after|wards,
wi&s;hing the Sun, whom they wor&s;hip,
might &s;hoot him into the Brea&s;t with an Arrow,
<PB N="77" REF="79">
if ever he failed to be my Friend; and giving
the Point of the Arrow to me, was to be a Te&s;ti|mony,
that I was the Man he had &s;worn to; and
never was Chri&s;tian more punctual to an Oath,
than he was to this, for he was a &s;worn Servant
to us for many a weary Month after that.</P>
<P>When I brought him to the Surgeon, he im|mediately
dre&s;s'd the Wound in his Haunch or
Bottock, and found the Bullet had only graz'd
upon the Fle&s;h, and pa&s;s'd, as it were, by it,
but it was not lodg'd in the Part; &s;o that it was
&s;oon healed and well again: But as to his Arm,
he found one of the Bones broken, which are in
the Fore-part from the Wri&s;t to the Elbow; and
this he &s;et, and &s;plinter'd it up, and bound his
Arm in a Sling, hanging it about his Neck, and
making Signs to him that he &s;hould not &s;tir it;
which he was &s;o &s;trict an Ob&s;erver of, that he &s;et
him down, and never mov'd one Way or other,
but as the Surgeon gave him Leave.</P>
<P>I took a great deal of Pains to acquaint this
Negroe what we intended to do, and what U&s;e
we intended to make of his Men; and particu|larly,
to teach him the Meaning of what we &s;aid:
E&s;pecially to teach him &s;ome Words, &s;uch as <HI>Yes</HI>
and <HI>No,</HI> and what they meant, and to innure him
to our Way of Talking, and he was very willing
and apt to learn any thing I taught him.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to let him &s;ee, that we intended
to carry our Provi&s;ion with us from the fir&s;t Day;
but he made Signs to us to tell us we need not,
for that we &s;hould find Provi&s;ions enough every
where for fourty Days. It was very difficult for
us to under&s;tand how he expre&s;s'd Forty; for he
knew no Figures, but &s;ome Words they u&s;ed to
one another that they under&s;tood it by. At la&s;t,
<PB N="78" REF="80">
one of the Negroes, by his Order, &s;aid fourty
little Stones one by another, to &s;hew us how
many Days we &s;hould travel, and find Provi&s;ions
&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Then I &s;hew'd him our Baggage, which was
very heavy, particularly our Powder and Shot,
Lead, Iron, Carpenters Tools, Seamens In&s;tru|ments,
Ca&s;es of Bottles, and other Lumber. He
took &s;ome of the things up in his Hand to &s;ee
the Weight, and &s;hook his Head at them; &s;o I
told our People, they mu&s;t re&s;olve to divide their
Things into &s;mall Parcels, and make them porta|ble;
and accordingly they did &s;o, by which means
we were fain to leave all our Che&s;ts behind us,
which were Eleven in Number.</P>
<P>Then he made Signs to us, that he would pro|cure
&s;ome Buffloes, or young Bulls, <HI>as I called
them,</HI> to carry things for us, and made Signs too,
that if we were weary, we might be carry'd too;
but that we &s;lighted, only were willing to have
the Creatures, becau&s;e at la&s;t, when they could
&s;erve us no farther for Carriage, we might eat
them all up if we had any Occa&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>I then carry'd him to our Bark, and &s;hewed
him what things we had there; he &s;eem'd
amaz'd at the Sight of our Bark, having never
&s;een any thing of that Kind before, for their Boats
are mo&s;t wretched things, &s;uch as I never &s;aw be|fore,
having no Head or Stern, and being made
only of the Skins of Goats &s;ewed together with
dried Guts of Goats and Sheep, and done over
with a kind of &s;limy Stuff like Ro&s;in and Oil,
but of a mo&s;t nau&s;eous, odious Smell, and they
are poor mi&s;erable things for Boats, the wor&s;t
that any Part of the World ever &s;aw; a Canoe is
an excellent Contrivance compared to them.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81">
But to return to our Boat: We carried our
new Prince into it, and help'd him over the Side,
becau&s;e of his Lamene&s;s. We made Signs to him,
that his Men mu&s;t carry our Goods for us, and
&s;hewed him what we had; he an&s;wer'd, <HI>Ce Seignior,</HI>
or, <HI>Yes Sir,</HI> (for we had taught him that Word,
and the Meaning of it) and taking up a Bundle,
he made Signs to us, that when his Arm was well,
he would carry &s;ome for us.</P>
<P>I made Signs again, to tell him, that if he
would make his Men carry them, we would not
let him carry any thing. We had &s;ecured all the
Pri&s;oners in a narrow Place, where we had bound
them with Matt Cords, and &s;et up Stakes like
a Pali&s;ado round them; &s;o when we carry'd the
Prince on Shore, we went with him to them, and
made Signs to him, to ask them if they were wil|ling
to go with us to the Country of Lions. Ac|cordingly
he made a long Speech to them, and
we could under&s;tand by it, that he told them, if
they were willing, they mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>Ce Seignior,</HI> tel|ling
them what it &s;ignify'd. They immediately
an&s;wered, <HI>Ce Seignior,</HI> and clapt their Hands,
looking up to the Sun, which the Prince &s;igni|fy'd
to us, was Swearing to be faithful. But
as &s;oon as they had &s;aid &s;o, one of them made a
long Speech to the Prince, and in it, we percei|ved
by his Ge&s;tures, which were very antick, that
they de&s;ired &s;omething from us, and that they
were in great Concern about it. So I ask'd him
as well as I could, what it was they de&s;ired of us;
he told us by Signs, that they de&s;ired we &s;hould
clap our Hands to the Sun (that was to &s;wear)
that we would not kill them, that we would
give them <HI>Chiaruck,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Bread, would
not &s;tarve them, and would not let the Lions eat
<PB N="80" REF="82">
them. I told him we would promi&s;e all that;
then he pointed to the Sun, and clapt his
Hands, &s;igning to me, that I &s;hould do &s;o too,
which I did; at which all the Pri&s;oners fell flat
on the Ground, and ri&s;ing up again, made the
odde&s;t, wilde&s;t Cries that ever I heard.</P>
<P>I think it was the fir&s;t time in my Life that
ever any religious Thought affected me; but
I could not refrain &s;ome Reflections, and almo&s;t
Tears, in con&s;idering how happy it was, that
I was not born among &s;uch Creatures as the&s;e,
and was not &s;o &s;tupidly ignorant and barbarous:
But this &s;oon went off again, and I was not
troubled again with any Qualms of that Sort
for a long time after.</P>
<P>When this Ceremony was over, our Concern
was to get &s;ome Provi&s;ions, as well for the pre|&s;ent
Sub&s;i&s;tence of our Pri&s;oners, as our &s;elves;
and making Signs to our Prince, that we were
thinking upon that Subject, he made Signs to
me, that if I would let one of the Pri&s;oners go
to his Town, he &s;hould bring Provi&s;ions, and
&s;hould bring &s;ome Bea&s;ts to carry our Baggage.
I &s;eemed loath to tru&s;t him, and &s;uppo&s;ing that
he would run away, he made great Signs of Fi|delity,
and with his own Hands tied a Rope
about his Neck, offering me one End of it, inti|mating,
that I &s;hould hang him, if the Man did
not come again. So I con&s;ented, and he gave him
Abundance of In&s;tructions, and &s;ent him away,
pointing to the Light of the Sun, which it &s;eems
was to tell him, at what time he mu&s;t be back.</P>
<P>The Fellow run as if he was mad, and held
it till he was quite out of Sight, by which I
&s;uppo&s;ed he had a great Way to go. The next
Morning, about two Hours before the Time
<PB N="81" REF="83">
appointed, the Black Prince, for &s;o I always
called him, beckoning with his Hand to me,
and hollooing after his Manner, de&s;ired me to
come to him, which I did, when pointing to a little
Hill about two Miles off, I &s;aw plainly a little
Drove of Cattel, and &s;everal People with them;
tho&s;e he told me by Signs were the Man he had
&s;ent, and &s;everal more with him, and Cattel for us.</P>
<P>Accordingly by the time appointed, he came
quite to our Hutts, and brought with him a great
many Cowys, oung Runts, about 16 Goats, and, four
young Bulls, taught to carry Burthens.</P>
<P>This was a Supply of Provi&s;ions &s;ufficient; as
for Bread we were obliged to &s;hift with &s;ome
Roots which we had made u&s;e of before. We
then began to con&s;ider of making &s;ome large
Bags like the Soldiers Knap&s;acks, for their Men
to carry our Baggage in, and to make it ea&s;y
to them; and the Goats being killed, I ordered
the Skins to be &s;pread in the Sun, and they
were as dry in two Days as could be de&s;ired; &s;o
we found means to make &s;uch little Bags as we
wanted, and began to divide our Baggage into
them: When the Black Prince found what
they were for, and how ea&s;y they were of Car|riage
when we put them on, he &s;miled a lit|tle,
and &s;ent away the Man again to fetch
Skins, and he brought two Natives more
with him, all loaded with Skins better cured
than ours, and of other kinds, &s;uch as we could
not tell what Names to give them.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Men brought the Black Prince two
Lances of the &s;ort they u&s;e in their Fights, but
finer than ordinary, being made of black &s;mooth
Wood, as fine as Ebony, and headed at the Point
with the End of a long Tooth of &s;ome Creature,
<PB N="82" REF="84">
we could not tell of what Creature; the Head
was &s;o firm put on, and the Tooth &s;o &s;trong,
tho' no bigger than my Thumb, and &s;harp at
the End, that I never &s;aw any thing like it
in any Place in the World.</P>
<P>The Prince would not take them till I gave
him Leave, but made Signs that they &s;hould
give them to me; however I gave him Leave
to take them him&s;elf, for I &s;aw evident Signs of
an honourable ju&s;t Principle in him.</P>
<P>We now prepared for our March, when
the Prince coming to me, and pointing to|wards
the &s;everal Quarters of the World, made
Signs to know, which way we intended to go;
and when I &s;hewed him pointing to the We&s;t,
he pre&s;ently let me know, there was a great
River a little further to the North, which was
able to carry our Bark many Leagues into the
Country due We&s;t. I pre&s;ently took the Hint,
and enquired for the Mouth of the River, which
I under&s;tood by him was above a Day's March,
and by our E&s;timation we found it about &s;even
Leagues further; I take this to be the great
River marked by our Chart-Makers at the
Northmo&s;t Part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> and
called there <HI>Quilloa.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ulting thus with our &s;elves, we re&s;olved
to take the Prince, and as many of the Pri&s;oners
as we could &s;tow in our Frigate, and go about
by the Bay into the River; and that eight of us
with our Arms &s;hould march by Land, to meet
them on the River-&s;ide; for the Prince carrying
us to a ri&s;ing Ground, had &s;hew'd us the River
very plain a great Way up the Country,
and in one Place it was not above &s;ix Miles
to it.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85">
It was my Lot to march by Land, and be
Captain of the whole Carravan: I had eight of
our own Men with me, and Seven and Thirty
of our Pri&s;oners, without any Baggage, for all
our Luggage was yet on board. We drove the
young Bulls with us; nothing was ever &s;o
tame, &s;o willing to work, or carry any thing.
The Negroes would ride upon them four at a
Time, and they would go very willingly; they
would eat out of our Hand, lick our Feet, and
were as tractable as a Dog.</P>
<P>We drove with us &s;ix or &s;even Cows for
Food; but our Negroes knew nothing of curing
the Fle&s;h by &s;alting and drying it, till we
&s;hew'd them the Way, and then they were
mighty willing to do &s;o as long as we had any
Salt to do it with, and to carry Salt a great
Way too, after we found we &s;hould have no more.</P>
<P>It was an ea&s;y March to the River Side for us
that went by Land, and we came thither in a
Piece of a Day, being as above not above &s;ix <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Miles; whereas it was no le&s;s than five Days
before they came to us by Water, the Wind in
the Bay having failed them, and the Way, by
Rea&s;on of a great Turn or Reach in the River
being above fifty Miles about.</P>
<P>We &s;pent this time in a thing which the
two Strangers, which brought the Prince the
two Lances, put into the Head of the Pri&s;oners;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) to make Bottles of the Goats-Skins to carry
fre&s;h Water in, which it &s;eems they knew we
&s;hould come to want; and the Men, did it &s;o dex|terou&s;ly,
having dried Skins fetched them by
tho&s;e two Men, that before our Ve&s;&s;el came up,
they had every Man a Pouch like a Bladder, to
carry fre&s;h Water in, hanging over their Shoulder
<PB N="84" REF="86">
by a Thong made of other Skins, about three In|ches
broad, like the Sling of a Fuzee.</P>
<P>Our Prince, to a&s;&s;ure us of the Fidelity of the
Men in this March, had ordered them to be
tied two and two by the Wri&s;t, as we handcuff
Pri&s;oners in <HI>England;</HI> and made them &s;o &s;en&s;ible
of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it, that he made them
do it them&s;elves, appointing four of them, to
bind the re&s;t; but we found them &s;o hone&s;t, and par|ticularly
&s;o obedient to him, that after we were
gotten a little further off of their own Country,
we &s;et them all at Liberty, tho' when he came
to us, he would have them tied again, and they
continued &s;o for a good while.</P>
<P>All the Country on the Bank of the River was
a high Land, no mar&s;hy &s;wampy Ground in it,
the Verdure good, and Abundance of Cattel feed|ing
upon it, wherever we went, or which
Way &s;oever we look'd; there was not much
Wood indeed, at lea&s;t not near us, but further up
we &s;aw Oak, Cedar, and Pine Trees, &s;ome of which
were very large.</P>
<P>The River was a fair open Channel about as
broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> below <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and a
&s;trong Tide of Flood, which we found held us
about 60 Miles, the Channel deep; nor did we
find any Want of Water for a great Way. In
&s;hort, we went merrily up the River with the
Flood, and the Wind blowing &s;till fre&s;h at E. and
E. N. E, we &s;temm'd the Ebb ea&s;ily al&s;o, e&s;pecially
while the River continued broad and deep; but
when we came pa&s;t the Swelling of the Tide,
and had the natural Current of the River to go
again&s;t, we found it too &s;trong for us, and began
to think of quitting our Bark; but the Prince
would by no means agree to that, for finding we
<PB N="85" REF="87">
had on board pretty good Store of Roping made
of Matts and Flags, which I de&s;cribed before,
he ordered all the Pri&s;oners which were on &s;hore,
to come and take hold of tho&s;e Ropes, and tow
us along by the Shore Side; and as we hoi&s;ted
our Sail too, to ea&s;e them, the Men run along
with us at a very great Rate.</P>
<P>In this Manner the River carry'd us up by our
Computation near 200 Miles, and then it narrow|ed
apace, and was not above as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI>
is at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> or thereabouts; and after another
Day, we came to a great Water-fall or Cataract,
enough to fright us, for I believe the whole
Body of Water fell at once perpendicularly down
a Precipice, above &s;ixty Foot high, which made
a Noi&s;e enough to deprive men of their Hearing,
and we heard it above Ten Miles before we came
to it.</P>
<P>Here we were at a full Stop, and now our Pri&s;o|ners
went fir&s;t on Shore; they had worked very
hard, and very chearfully, relieving one another,
tho&s;e that were weary being taken into the Bark.
Had we had Canoes, or any Boats which might
have been carried by Mens Strength, we might
have gone 200 Miles more up this River in &s;mall
Boats, but our great Boat could go no farther.</P>
<P>All this Way the Country looked green and
plea&s;ant, and was full of Cattel, and &s;ome Peo|ple
we &s;aw, tho' not many; but this we ob&s;erv'd
now, that the People did no more under&s;tand our
Pri&s;oners here, than we could under&s;tand them;
being it &s;eems of different Nations, and of diffe|rent
Speech. We had yet &s;een no wild Bea&s;ts, or at
lea&s;t none that came very near us; except two
Days before we came at the Water-fall, when we
&s;aw three of the mo&s;t beautiful Leopards that ever
<PB N="86" REF="88">
were &s;een, &s;tanding upon the Bank of the River
on the North-&s;ide, our Pri&s;oners being all on the
other Side of the Water. Our Gunner e&s;py'd
them fir&s;t, and ran to fetch his Gun, putting a
Ball extraordinary in it; and coming to me,
now Captain <HI>Bob,</HI> &s;ays he, where's your Prince,
&s;o I called him out, now, &s;ays he, tell your
Men not to be afraid, tell them they &s;hall &s;ee
that Thing in his Hand, &s;peak in Fire to one
of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts, and make it kill it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The poor Negroes looked as if they had
been all going to be killed, notwith&s;tanding
what their Prince &s;aid to them, and &s;tood &s;ta|ring
to expect the I&s;&s;ue, when on a &s;udden the
Gunner fired; and as he was a very good Marks-Man,
he &s;hot the Creature with two Sluggs ju&s;t
in the Head. As &s;oon as the Leopard felt her
&s;elf &s;truck, &s;he rear'd up on her two hind Legs
bolt upright, and throwing her Fore-Paws about
in the Air, fell backward, growling and &s;trug|gling,
and immediately died; the other two
frighted with the Fire and the Noi&s;e, fled, and
were out of Sight in an In&s;tant.</P>
<P>But the two frighted Leopards were not in
half the Con&s;ternation that our Pri&s;oners were;
four or five of them fell down as if they had
been &s;hot, &s;everal others fell on their Knees, and
lifted up their Hands to us; whether to wor|&s;hip
us, or pray us not to kill them, we did
not know; but we made Signs to their Prince
to encourage them, which he did, but it was
with much ado that he brought them to their
Sen&s;e; nay, the Prince, notwith&s;tanding all that
was &s;aid to prepare him for it, yet when the
Piece went off, he gave a Start as if he would
have leap'd into the River.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89">
When we &s;aw the Creature killed, I had a
great Mind to have the Skin of her, and made
Signs to the Prince, that he &s;hould &s;end &s;ome
of his Men over to take the Skin off. As &s;oon
as he &s;poke but a Word, four of them that
offered them&s;elves were untied, and immediately
they jump'd into the River, and &s;wam over,
and went to work with him: The Prince ha|ving
a Knife that we gave him, made four wood|en
Knives &s;o clever, as I never &s;aw any thing
like them in my Life, and in le&s;s than an Hour's
time, they brought me the Skin of the Leopard,
which was a mon&s;trous great one, for it was
from the Ears to the Tail about &s;even Foot,
and near five Foot Broad on the Back, and mo&s;t
admirably &s;potted all over; the Skin of this
Leopard I brought to <HI>London</HI> many Years after.</P>
<P>We were now all upon a Level, as to our
travelling; being un&s;hipp'd, for our Bark would
&s;wim no farther, and &s;he was too heavy to carry
on our Backs; but as we found the Cour&s;e of the
River went a great Way farther, we con&s;ulted
our Carpenters, whether we could not pull the
Bark in Pieces, and make us three or four &s;mall
Boats to go on with. They told us, we might do
&s;o, but it would be very long a-doing; and, that
when we had done, we had neither Pitch or
Tar to make them &s;ound, to keep the Water
out, or Nails to fa&s;ten the Plank; but one of
them toldus, that as &s;oon as he could come at any
large Tree, near the River he would make us a
Canoe or two in a Quarter of the Time, and
which would &s;erve us as well for all the U&s;es we
could have any Occa&s;ion for as a Boat; and
&s;uch, that if we came to any Water-falls, we
might take them up, and carry them for a Mile
or two by Land, upon our Shoulders.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90">
Upon this we gave over the Thoughts of our
Frigate, and hauling her into a little Cove, or
Inlet, where a &s;mall Brook came into the main
River, we laid her up for tho&s;e that came next,
and marched forward. We &s;pent indeed two
Days dividing our Baggage, and loading our
tame Buffloes and our Negroes: Our Pow|der
and Shot, which was the thing we were
mo&s;t careful of, we ordered thus: Fir&s;t the Powder
we divided into little Leather Bags, that is
to &s;ay, Bags of dried Skins with the Hair in|ward,
that the Powder might not grow damp;
and then we put tho&s;e Bags into other Bags
made of Bullocks Skins, very thick and hard,
with the Hair outward, that no Wet might come
in; and this &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that in the
greate&s;t Rains we had, whereof &s;ome were very
violent and very long, we always kept our Pow|der
dry. Be&s;ides the&s;e Bags which held our
chief Magazine, we divided to every one a
Quarter of a Pound of Powder, and Half a Pound
of Shot to carry always about us; which as it
was enough for our pre&s;ent U&s;e, &s;o we were
willing to have no Weight to carry more than
was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e of the Heat.</P>
<P>We kept &s;till on the Bank of the River, and
for that Rea&s;on had very little Communication
with the People of the Country; for, having al&s;o
our Bark &s;tored with Plenty of Provi&s;ions, we
had had no Occa&s;ion to look abroad for a Sup|ply;
but now we came to march on Foot, we
were obliged often to &s;eek out for Food. The
fir&s;t Place we came to on the River that gave us
any Stop, was a little Negro Town, contain|ing
about 50 Hutts, and there appeared about
400 People, for they all came out to &s;ee us,
<PB N="89" REF="91">
and wonder at us. When our Negroes appea|peared,
the Inhabitants began to fly to Arms,
thinking there had been Enemies coming upon
them; but our Negroes, tho' they could not
&s;peak their Language, made Signs to them, that
they had no Weapons, and were tied two and two
together, as Captives; that there were People
behind who came from the Sun, and that could
kill them all, and make them alive again, if they
plea&s;ed; but that they would do them no Hurt,
and came with Peace. As &s;oon as they under&s;tood
this, they laid down their Lances, and Bows and
Arrows, and came and &s;truck twelve large Stakes
in the Ground, as a Token of Peace, bowing
them&s;elves to us in Token of Submi&s;&s;ion. But as
&s;oon as they &s;aw white Men with Beards, that
is to &s;ay, Mu&s;tachoes, they run &s;creaming away
as in a Fright.</P>
<P>We kept at a Di&s;tance from them, not to be
too familiar; and when we did appear, it was
but two or three of us at a time. But our Pri&s;o|ners
made them under&s;tand, that we required
&s;ome Provi&s;ions of them; &s;o they brought us
&s;ome black Cattel, for they have Abundance of
Cows and Buffloes all over that Side of the
Country, as al&s;o great Numbers of Deer. Our
Cutler, who had now a great Stock of things of
his Handy-work, gave them &s;ome little Knick
Knacks, as Plates of Silver and of Iron, cut Dia|mond
Fa&s;hion, and cut into Hearts and into Rings,
and they were mightily plea&s;ed. They al&s;o
brought &s;everal Sorts of Fruits and Roots, which
we did not under&s;tand, but our Negroes &s;ed hear|tily
on them, and after we had &s;een them eat
them, we did &s;o too.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92">
Having &s;tock'd our &s;elves here with Fle&s;h and
Roots as much as we could well carry, we divi|ded
the Burthens among our Negroes, appointing
about 30 to 40 Pound Weight to a Man, which
we thought indeed was Load enough in a hot
Country; and the Negroes did not at all repine
at it, but would &s;ometimes help one another
when they began to be weary, which did happen
now and then, tho' not often: Be&s;ides, as mo&s;t of
their Luggage was our Provi&s;ion, it lighten'd eve|ry
Day like <HI>Aex&s;op</HI>'s Basket of Bread, till we came
to get a Recruit. Note, when we loaded them,
we untied their Hands, and tied them two and
two together by one Foot. The third Day of our
March from this Place, our chief Carpenter de&s;i|red
us to halt, and &s;et up &s;ome Hutts, for he
had found out &s;ome Trees that he liked, and
re&s;olved to make us &s;ome Canoes; for as he told
me, he knew we &s;hould have Marching enough on
Foot after we left the River, and he was re&s;olved
to go no farther by Land than needs mu&s;t.</P>
<P>We had no &s;ooner given Order for our little
Camp, and given Leave to our Negroes to lay
down their Loads, but they fell to Work to build
our Hutts; and tho' they were tied, as above,
yet they did it &s;o nimbly, as &s;urprized us. Here
we &s;et &s;ome of the Negroes quite at Liberty,
that is to &s;ay, without tying them, having the
Prince's Word pa&s;s'd for their Fidelity; and &s;ome
of the&s;e were ordered to help the Carpenters,
which they did very handily, with a little Di|rection,
and others were &s;ent to &s;ee whether they
could get any Provi&s;ion near Hand; but in&s;tead
of Provi&s;ions, three of them came in with two
Bows and Arrows, and five Lances. They could
not ea&s;ily make us under&s;tand how they came by
<PB N="91" REF="93">
them, only that they had &s;urprized &s;ome Negroe
Women, who were in &s;ome Hutts, the Men be|ing
from Home, and they had found the Lances
and Bows in the Hutts or Hou&s;es, the Women
and Children flying away at the Sight of them,
as from Robbers. We &s;eem'd very angry at them,
and made the Prince ask them, if they had not
kill'd any of the Women or Children, making
them believe, that if they had kill'd any Body,
we would make them kill them&s;elves too; but
they prote&s;ted their Innocence, &s;o we excu&s;ed
them. Then they brought us the Bows and Ar|rows
and Lances; but at a Motion of their black
Prince, we gave them back the Bows and Arrows,
and gave them Leave to go out to &s;ee what they
could kill for Food; and here we gave them the
Law of Arms, <HI>viz.</HI> That if any Men appeared to
a&s;&s;ault them, or &s;hoot at them, or offer any Vio|lence
to them, they might kill them; but that
they &s;hould not offer to kill or hurt any that
offer'd them Peace, or laid down their Weapons,
nor any Women or Children, upon any Occa&s;ion
what&s;oever. The&s;e were our Articles of War.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Fellows had not been gone out above
three or four Hours, but one of them came run|ning
to us without his Bow and Arrows, hallooing
and hooping a great while before he came at us,
<HI>Okoamo, Okoamo,</HI> which it &s;eems was, <HI>Help, Help.</HI>
The re&s;t of the Negroes ro&s;e up in a Hurry,
and by Two's, as they could, run forward toward
their Fellows to know what the Matter was. As
for me, I did not under&s;tand it, nor any of our
People; the Prince look'd as if &s;omething unlucky
had fallen out, and &s;ome of our Men took up
their Arms, to be ready on Occa&s;ion. But the
Negroes &s;oon di&s;cover'd the Thing; for we &s;aw
<PB N="92" REF="94">
four of them pre&s;ently after coming along with a
great Load of Meat upon their Backs. The Ca&s;e
was, that the fir&s;t two who went out with their
Bows and Arrows, meeting with a great Herd
of Deer in the Plain, had been &s;o nimble as to
&s;hoot three of them; and then one of them came
running to us for Help, to fetch them away.
This was the fir&s;t Veni&s;on we had met with up|on
all our March, and we fea&s;ted upon it very
plentifully; and this was the fir&s;t time we be|gan
to prevail with our Prince to eat his Meat
dre&s;t our Way; after which, his Men were pre|vailed
with by his Example, but before that, they
eat mo&s;t of the Fle&s;h they had quite raw.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h'd now we had brought &s;ome Bows and
Arrows out with us, which we might have done;
and we began to have &s;o much Confidence in
our Negroes, and to be &s;o familiar with them,
that we oftentimes let them go, or the greate&s;t
Part of them, unty'd, being well a&s;&s;ured they
would not leave us, and that they did not know
what Cour&s;e to take without us; but one thing
we re&s;olved not to tru&s;t them with, and that was
the Charging our Guns; but they always believed
our Guns had &s;ome heavenly Power in them, that
they would &s;end forth Fire and Smoke, and &s;peak
with a dreadful Noi&s;e, and kill at a Di&s;tance
whenever we bid them.</P>
<P>In about eight Days we fini&s;hed three Ca|noes,
and in them we embarked our white Men
and our Baggage, with our Prince, and &s;ome of
the Pri&s;oners. We al&s;o found it needful to keep
&s;ome of our &s;elves always on Shore, not only
to manage the Negroes, but to defend them from
Enemies and wild Bea&s;ts. Abundance of little
Incidents happened upon this March, which it is
<PB N="93" REF="95">
not po&s;&s;ible to crowd into this Account; parti|cularly,
we &s;aw more wild Bea&s;ts now than we
did before, &s;ome Elephants, and two or three
Lions; none of which Kinds we had &s;een any of
before; and we found our Negroes were more
afraid of them a great deal than we were; prin|cipally
becau&s;e they had no Bows and Arrows,
or Lances, which were the particular Weapons
they were bred up to the Exerci&s;e of.</P>
<P>But we cured them of their Fears, by being
always ready with our Fire-Arms. However, as
we were willing to be &s;paring of our Powder,
and the Killing any of the Creatures now was no
Advantage to us, &s;eeing their Skins were too hea|vy
for us to carry, and their Fle&s;h not good to
eat, we re&s;olved therefore to keep &s;ome of our
Pieces uncharg'd, and only prim'd, and cau&s;ing
them to fla&s;h in the Pan, the Bea&s;ts, even the
Lions them&s;elves, would always &s;tart, and fly
back when they &s;aw it, and immediately march off.</P>
<P>We pa&s;t Abundance of Inhabitants upon this
upper Part of the River, and with this Ob&s;erva|tion,
that almo&s;t every ten Miles we came to,
a &s;everal Nation, and every &s;everal Nation had
a different Speech, or el&s;e their Speech had dif|fering
Dialects, &s;o that they did not under&s;tand
one another. They all abounded in Cattel, e&s;pe|cially
on the River Side; and the eighth Day of
this &s;econd Navigation, we met with a little Ne|groe
Town, where they had growing a Sort of
Corn like Rice, which eat very &s;weet; and as we
got &s;ome of it of the People, we made very good
Cakes of Bread of it, and making a Fire, bak'd
them on the Ground, after the Fire was &s;wept
away very well; &s;o that hitherto we had no
Want of Provi&s;ions of any kind we could de&s;ire.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">
Our Negroes towing our Canoes, we travel|led
at a con&s;iderable Rate, and by our own Ac|count,
could not go le&s;s than 20 or 25 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Miles a Day, and the River continuing to be much
at the &s;ame Breadth, and very deep all the Way,
till on the tenth Day we came to another Ca|taract;
for a Ridge of high Hills cro&s;&s;ing the whole
Channel of the River, the Water came tumbling
down the Rocks from one Stage to another in
a &s;trange Manner: So that it was a continued
Link of Cataracts from one to another, in the
Manner of a Caskade; only, that the Falls were
&s;ometimes a Quarter of a Mile from one another,
and the Noi&s;e confu&s;ed and frightful.</P>
<P>We thought our Voyaging was at a full Stop
now; but three of us, with a Couple of our
Negroes, mounting the Hills another Way, to
view the Cour&s;e of the River, we found a fair
Channel again after about half a Mile's March, and
that it was like to hold us a good Way farther.
So we &s;et all Hands to Work, unloaded our Car|go,
and hauled our Canoes on Shore, to &s;ee if
we could carry them.</P>
<P>Upon Examination, we found that they were
very heavy; but our Carpenters &s;pending but
one Day's Work one them, hew'd away &s;o much
of the Timber from their Out&s;ides, as reduced
them very much, and yet they were as fit to
&s;wim as before. When this was done, ten Men
with Poles took up one of the Canoes, and made
nothing to carry it. So we ordered twenty Men
to each Canoe, that one Ten might relieve an|other;
and thus we carried all our Canoes, and
launch'd them into the Water again, and then
fetch'd our Luggage, and loaded it all again
into the Canoes, and all in an Afternoon; and
<PB N="95" REF="97">
the next Morning early we mov'd forward a|gain.
When we had towed about four Days
more, our Gunner, who was our Pilot, begun to
ob&s;erve that we did not keep our right Cour&s;e &s;o
exactly as we ought, the River winding away a
little towards the North, and gave us Notice
of it accordingly. However, we were not wil|ling
to lo&s;e the Advantage of Water-Carriage, at
lea&s;t not till we were forced to it; &s;o we jogg'd on,
and the River &s;erved us about Three&s;core Miles
further; but then we found it grew very &s;mall
and &s;hallow, having pa&s;s'd the Mouths of &s;eve|ral
little Brooks or Rivulets which come into it,
and at Length it became but a Brook it &s;elf.</P>
<P>We tow'd up as far as ever our Boats would
&s;wim, and we went two Days the further, ha|ving
been about twelve Days in this la&s;t Part
of the River, by Lightning the Boats, and taking
our Luggage out, which we made the Negroes
carry, being willing to ea&s;e our &s;elves as long
as we could; but at the End of the&s;e two Days,
in &s;hort, there was not Water enough to &s;wim
a <HI>London</HI> Wherry.</P>
<P>We now &s;et forward wholly by Land, and
without any Expectation of more Water Carri|age.
All our Concern for more Water, was to
be &s;ure to have a Supply for our Drinking; and
therefore upon every Hill that we came near,
we clamber'd up to the highe&s;t Part, to &s;ee the
Country before us, and to make the be&s;t Judg|ment
we could which way to go to keep the low|e&s;t
Grounds, and as near &s;ome Stream of Water
as we could.</P>
<P>The Country held verdant, well grown with
Trees, and &s;pread with Rivers and Brooks, and
tolerably well with Inhabitants, for about thirty
<PB N="96" REF="98">
Days March. After our leaving the Canoes, du|ring
which time things went pretty well with
us; we did not tye our &s;elves down when to
march, and when to halt, but order'd tho&s;e
things as our Convenience, and the Health and
Ea&s;e of our People, as well our Servants, as our
&s;elves, required.</P>
<P>About the Middle of this March, we came
into a low and plain Country, in which we per|ceived
a greater Number of Inhabitants than in
any other Country we had gone thro'; but that
which was wor&s;e for us, we found them a fierce,
barbarous, treacherous People, and who at fir&s;t
look'd upon us as Robbers, and gathered them|&s;elves
in Numbers to attack us.</P>
<P>Our Men were terrified at them at fir&s;t, and
began to di&s;cover an unu&s;ual Fear; and even our
black Prince &s;eemed in a great deal of Confu&s;ion:
But I &s;miled at him, and &s;hewing him &s;ome of our
Guns, I asked him, if he thought that which
killed the &s;potted Cat, (for &s;o they called the
Leopard in their Language) could not make a
Thou&s;and of tho&s;e naked Creatures die at one
Blow? Then he laugh'd, and &s;aid Yes, he believ'd
it would. Well then, &s;aid I, tell your Men not
to be afraid of the&s;e People, for we &s;hall &s;oon
give them a Ta&s;te of what we can do, if they
pretend to meddle with us. However, we con|&s;idered
we were in the Middle of a va&s;t Coun|try,
and we knew not what Numbers of Peo|ple
and Nations we might be &s;urrounded with;
and above all, we knew not how much we
might &s;tand in Need of the Friend&s;hip of the&s;e
that we were now among; &s;o that we ordered the
Negroes to try all the Methods they could, to
make them Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99">
Accordingly, the two Men who had gotten
Bows and Arrows, and two more to whom we
gave the Prince's two fine Lances, went foremo&s;t
with five more having long Poles in their Hands;
and after them ten of our Men advanced toward
the Negro Town that was next to us, and we
all &s;tood ready to &s;uccour them if there &s;hould
be Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>When they came pretty near their Hou&s;es,
our Negroes halloo'd in their &s;creaming Way, and
called to them as loud as they could; upon their
calling, &s;ome of the Men came out, and an&s;wer'd,
and immediately after the whole Town, Men
Women and Children appeared: Our Negroes
with their long Poles went forward a little, and
&s;tuck them all in the Ground, and left them,
which in their Country was a Signal of Peace, but
the other did not under&s;tand the Meaning of
that. Then the two Men with Bows, laid down
their Bows and Arrows, went forward unarmed,
and made Signs of Peace to them, which at
la&s;t the other began to under&s;tand; &s;o two of
their Men laid down their Bows and Arrows,
and came towards them: Our Men made all the
Signs of Friend&s;hip to them that they could
think of, putting their Hands up to their
Mouths, as a Sign that they wanted Provi&s;ions to
eat, and the other pretended to be plea&s;ed and
friendly, and went back to their Fellows, and
talk'd with them a while, and they came forward
again, and made Signs that they would bring
&s;ome Provi&s;ions to them before the Sun &s;et; and
&s;o our Men came back again very well &s;ati&s;fied
for that time.</P>
<P>But an Hour before Sun-&s;et our Men went to
them again, ju&s;t in the &s;ame Po&s;ture as before,
<PB N="98" REF="100">
and they came according to their Appointment,
and brought Deers Fle&s;h, Roots, and the &s;ame
kind of Corn like Rice, <HI>which I mentioned above,</HI>
and our Negroes being furni&s;h'd with &s;uch Toys
as our Cutler had contrived, gave them &s;ome of
them, which they &s;eem'd infinitely pleas'd with,
and promis'd to bring more Provi&s;ions the next
Day.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the next Day they came again,
but our Men perceived they were more in Num|ber
by a great many than before; however, ha|ving
&s;ent out ten Men with Fire-Arms to &s;tand
ready, and our whole Army being in View al&s;o,
we were not much &s;urprized; nor was the
Treachery of the Enemy &s;o cunningly ordered
as in other Ca&s;es; for they might have &s;ur|rounded
our Negroes, which, were but nine,
under a Shew of Peace; but when they &s;aw our
Men advance almo&s;t as far as the Place where
they were the Day before, the Rogues &s;natch'd
up their Bows and Arrows, and come running
upon our Men like &s;o many Furies, at which
our ten Men called to the Negroes to come back
to them, which they did with Speed enough at
the fir&s;t Word, and &s;tood all behind our Men.
As they fled, the other advanced, and let fly
near a 100 of their Arrows at them, by which
two of our Negroes were wounded, and one we
thought had been killed. When they came to
the five Poles that our Men had &s;truck in the
Ground, they &s;tood &s;till a while, and gathering
about the Poles, looked at them, and handled
them as wondering at what they meant. We
then who were drawn up behind all, &s;ent one of
our Number to our ten Men, to bid them fire
among them, while they &s;tood &s;o thick, and to
<PB N="99" REF="101">
put &s;ome &s;mall Shot into their Guns, be&s;ides
the ordinary Charge, and to tell them, that we
would be up with them immediately.</P>
<P>Accordingly they made ready, but by that
time they were ready to fire, the Black Army
had left their wondering about the Poles, and
began to &s;tir as if they would come on, tho' &s;ee|ing
more Men &s;tand at &s;ome Di&s;tance behind
our Negroes, they could not tell what to make of
us; butif they did not under&s;tand us before, they
under&s;tood us le&s;s afterwards, for as &s;oon as ever
our Men found them begin to move forward,
they fired among the thicke&s;t of them, being
about the Di&s;tance of 120 Yards, as near as we
could gue&s;s.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Fright, the
Screaming and Yelling of tho&s;e Wretches upon
this fir&s;t Volley; we killed &s;ix of them, and woun|ded
11 or 12, I mean as we knew of; for, as they
&s;tood thick, and the &s;mall Shot, as we called it,
&s;cattered among them, we had Rea&s;on to believe
we wounded more that &s;tood farther off; for our
&s;mall Shot was made of Bits of Lead, and Bits
of Iron, Heads of Nails, and &s;uch things as
our diligent Artificer the Cutler help'd us to.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e that were killed and wounded, the
other frighted Creatures were under the greate&s;t
Amazement in the World, to think what &s;hould
hurt them; for they could &s;ee nothing but
Holes made in their Bodies they knew not how.
Then the Fire and the Noi&s;e amazed all their
Women and Children, and frighted them out of
their Wits, that they ran &s;taring and howling
about like mad Creatures.</P>
<P>However, all this did not make them fly,
which was what we wanted; nor did we find
<PB N="100" REF="102">
any of them die as it were with Fear, as at fir&s;t,
&s;o we re&s;olved upon a &s;econd Volley, and then
to advance as we did before. Whereupon our
re&s;erved Men advancing, we re&s;olved to fire
only three Men at a time, and move forward
like an Army firing in Platoons; &s;o being all in
Line we fired fir&s;t three on the Right, then
three on the Left, and &s;o on; and every time we
killed or wounded &s;ome of them; but &s;till they
did not fly, and yet they were &s;o frighted, that
they u&s;ed none of their Bows and Arrows, or
of their Lances; and we thought their Numbers
encrea&s;ed upon our Hands; particularly we
thought &s;o by the Noi&s;e; &s;o I called to our Men
to halt, and bid them pour in one whole Volley,
and then &s;hout, as we did in our fir&s;t Fight, and
&s;o run in upon them, and knock them down
with our Mu&s;quets.</P>
<P>But they were too wi&s;e for that too, for as &s;oon
as we had fired a whole Volley, and &s;houted,
they all run away, Men, Women, and Children,
&s;o fa&s;t, that in a few Moments we could not &s;ee
one Creature of them, except &s;ome that were
wounded and lame, who lay wallowing and
&s;creaming here and there upon the Ground, as
they happen'd to fall.</P>
<P>Upon this we came up to the Field of Battle,
where we found we had killed 37 of them, among
which were three Women, and had wounded
about 64 among which were two Women; by
wounded I mean, &s;uch as were &s;o maimed, as not
to be able to go away, and tho&s;e our Negroes
killed afterwards in a cowardly manner in cold
Blood, for which we were very angry, and
threatned to make them go to them if they did
&s;o again.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="103">
There was no great Spoil to be got, for they
were all &s;tark naked as they came into the
World, Men and Women together; &s;ome of
them having Feathers &s;tuck in their Hair, and
others a kind of Bracelets about their Necks, but
nothing el&s;e; but our Negroes got a Booty
here which we were very glad of, and this was
the Bows and Arrows of the vanqui&s;hed, of
which they found more than they knew what
to do with, belonging to the killed and woun|ded
Men; the&s;e we ordered them to pick up, and
they were very u&s;eful to us afterwards. After
the Fight, and our Negroes had gotten Bows
and Arrows, we &s;ent them out in Parties to &s;ee
what they could get, and they got &s;ome Pro|vi&s;ions;
but, which was better than all the re&s;t,
they brought us four more young Bulls, or Buf|floes,
that had been brought up to Labour, and
to carry Burthens: They knew them, it &s;eems,
by the Burthens they had carry'd having galled
their Backs; for, they have no Saddles to cover
them with in that Country.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Creatures not only ea&s;ed our Negroes,
but gave us an Opportunity to carry more Pro|vi&s;ions,
and our Negroes loaded them very hard
at this Place, with Fle&s;h and Roots, &s;uch as
we wanted very much afterwards.</P>
<P>In this Town we found a very little young Leo|pard,
about two Spans high; it was exceeding
tame, and purr'd like a Cat when we &s;troked it
with our Hands, being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, bred up among
the Negroes like a Hou&s;e-Dog. It was our Black
Prince, it &s;eems, who making his Tour among the
abandoned Hou&s;es or Hutts, found this Crea|ture
there, and making much of him, and giving
<PB N="102" REF="104">
a Bit or two of Fle&s;h to him, the Creature fol|lowed
him like a Dog; of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>Among the Negroes that were killed in this
Battle, there was one who had a little thin Bit
or Plate of Gold, about as big as a Six-Pence,
which hung by a little Bit of a twi&s;ted Gutt,
upon his Forehead, by which we &s;uppo&s;ed he
was a Man of &s;ome Eminence among them; but
that was not all, for this Bit of Gold put us
upon &s;earching very narrowly, if there was not
more of it to be had thereabouts, but we
$ound no ne at all.</P>
<P>From this Part of the Country we went on for
about 15 Days, and then found our &s;elves obliged
to march up a high Ridge of Mountains frightful
to behold, and the fir&s;t of the Kind that we met
with; and having no Guide but our little Pocket
Compa&s;s, we had no Advantage of Information
as to which was the be&s;t, or the wor&s;t Way, but
were obliged to chu&s;e by what we &s;aw, and &s;hift
as well as we could. We met with &s;everal Na|tions
of wild and naked People in the plain Coun|try,
before we came to tho&s;e Hills, and we found
them much more tractable and friendly than tho&s;e
Devils we had been forc'd to fight with; and tho'
we could learn little from the&s;e People, yet we
under&s;tood by the Signs they made, that there
was a va&s;t De&s;art beyond tho&s;e Hills, and, <HI>as our
Negroes called them,</HI> much Lion, much &s;potted Cat
(&s;o they called the Leopard) and they &s;ign'd to us
al&s;o, that we mu&s;t carry Water with us. At the
la&s;t of the&s;e Nations we furni&s;hed our &s;elves
with as much Provi&s;ion as we could po&s;&s;ibly car|ry,
not knowing what we had to &s;uffer, or what
Length we had to go; and to make our Way as
Familiar to us as po&s;&s;ible, I propo&s;ed, that of
<PB N="103" REF="105">
the la&s;t Inhabitants we could find, we &s;hould make
&s;ome Pri&s;oners, and carry them with us for
Guides over the De&s;art, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in car|rying
Provi&s;ion, and perhaps in getting it too.
The Advice was too nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;lighted;
&s;o finding by our dumb Signs to the Inhabitants,
that there were &s;ome People that dwelt at the
Foot of the Mountains, on the other Side, be|fore
we came to the De&s;art it &s;elf, we re&s;olved
to furni&s;h our &s;elves with Guides, by fair Means
or foul.</P>
<P>Here, by a moderate Computation, we conclu|ded
our &s;elves 700 Miles from the Sea Coa&s;t
where we began. Our Black Prince was this Day
&s;et free from the Sling his Arm hung in, our Sur|geon
having perf$$$ly re&s;tored it, and he &s;hewed
it to his own Countrymen quite well, which
made them greatly wonder. Al&s;o our two Ne|groes
began to recover, and their Wounds to heal
apace, for our Surgeon was very skilful in ma|naging
their Cure.</P>
<P>Having with infinite Labour mounted the&s;e
Hills, and coming to a View of the Country be|yond
them, it was indeed enough to a&s;toni&s;h as
&s;tout a Heart as ever was created. It was a va&s;t
howling Wilderne&s;s, not a Tree, a River, or a
Green thing to be &s;een, for as far as the Eye
could look; nothing but a &s;calding Sand, which,
as the Wind blew, drove about in Clouds, enough
to overwhelm Man and Bea&s;t; nor could we &s;ee
any End of it, either before us, which was
our Way, or to the right Hand or left: So that
truly our Men began to be di&s;couraged, and
talk of going back again; nor could we indeed
think of venturing over &s;uch a horrid Place as
<PB N="104" REF="106">
that before us, in which we &s;aw nothing but pre|&s;ent
Death.</P>
<P>I was as much affected with the Sight as any
of them, but for all that I could not bear the
Thoughts of going back again. I told them we had
march'd 700 Miles of our Way, and it would be
wor&s;e than Death to think of going back again;
and that if they thought the De&s;art was not pa&s;&s;a|ble,
I thought we &s;hould rather change our Cour&s;e,
and travel South till we came to the <HI>Cape of Good
Hope,</HI> or North to the Country that lay along the
<HI>Nile,</HI> where perhaps we might find &s;ome Way
or other over to the We&s;t Sea; for &s;ure all <HI>Africa</HI>
was not a De&s;art.</P>
<P>Our Gunner, who, as I &s;aid before, was our
Guide as to the Situation of Places, told us, that
he could not tell what to &s;ay to going for the
Cape; for it was a mon&s;trous Length, being from
the Place where we now were, not le&s;s than
1500 Miles, and by his Account, we were come
now a third Part of the Way to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Angola,</HI>
where we &s;hould meet with the We&s;tern Ocean,
and find Ways enough for our E&s;cape Home. On
the other Hand, he a&s;&s;ured us, and &s;hewed us a
Map of it, that if we went Northward, the We|&s;tern
Shore of <HI>Africk</HI> went out into the Sea above a
Thou&s;and Miles We&s;t; &s;o that we &s;hould have &s;o
much, and more Land, to travel afterwards;
which Land might, for ought we knew, be as
wild, barren, and de&s;art, as this: And therefore,
upon the whole, he propo&s;ed that we &s;hould at|tempt
this De&s;art, and perhaps we &s;hould not find
it &s;o long as we feared; and however, he pro|po&s;ed
that we &s;hould &s;ee how far our Provi&s;ions
would carry us, and in particular, our Water;
and that we &s;hould venture no farther than Half
<PB N="105" REF="107">
&s;o far as our Water would la&s;t; and if we found
no End of the De&s;art, we might come &s;afely back
again.</P>
<P>This Advice was &s;o rea&s;onable, that we all
approved of it; and accordingly we calculated,
that we were able to carry Provi&s;ions for 42
Days, but that we could not carry Water for
above 20 Days, tho' we were to &s;uppo&s;e it to
&s;tink too before that time expired. So that we
concluded, that if we did not come at &s;ome Wa|ter
in ten Days time, we would return, but if we
found a Supply of Water, we could then travel
21 Days; and if we &s;aw no End of the Wilder|ne&s;s
in that time, we would return al&s;o.</P>
<P>With this Regulation of our Mea&s;ures, we de|&s;cended
the Mountains, and it was the &s;econd
Day before we quite reached the Plain, where
however, to make us amends, we found a fine
little Rivulet of very good Water, Abundance
of Deer, a &s;ort of Creature like a Hare, but not
&s;o nimble, and who&s;e Fle&s;h we found very agree|able;
but we were deceived in our Intelligence,
for we found no People; &s;o we got no more Pri&s;o|ners
to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in carrying our Baggage.</P>
<P>The infinite Number of Deer and other Creatures
which we &s;aw here, we found was occa&s;ioned by
the Neighbourhood of the Wa&s;t or De&s;art, from
whence they retired hither for Food and Refre&s;h|ment.
We &s;tored our &s;elves here with Fle&s;h and
Roots of divers Kinds, which our Negroes under|&s;tood
better than we, and which &s;erved us for
Bread; and with as much Water as, (by the Al|lowance
of a Quart a Day to a Man for our Ne|groes,
and three Pints a Day a Man for our &s;elves,
and three Quarts a Day each, for our Buffloes)
would &s;erve us 20 Days: And thus loaden for a
<PB N="106" REF="108">
long mi&s;erable March, we &s;et forward, being
all &s;ound in Health, and very chearful, but not
alike &s;trong for &s;o great a Fatigue; and which
was our Grievance, were without a Guide.</P>
<P>In the very fir&s;t Entrance of the Wa&s;t, we
were exceedingly di&s;couraged; for we found the
Sand &s;o deep, and it &s;calded our Feet &s;o much with
the Heat, that after we had, as I may call it, wa|ded
rather than walk'd thro' it, about &s;even or
eight Miles, we were all heartily tired and faint;
even the very Negroes lay down and panted, like
Creatures that had been pu&s;h'd beyond their
Strength.</P>
<P>Here we found the Difference of Lodging great|ly
injurious to us; for (as before) we always made
us Hutts to &s;leep under, which cover'd us from
the Night Air, which is particularly unwhole&s;om
in tho&s;e hot Countries: But we had here no Shel|ter,
no Lodging after &s;o hard a March; for here
were no Trees, no not a Shrub near us: And
which was &s;till more frightful, towards Night we
began to hear the Wolves howl, the Lions bel|low,
and a great many wild A&s;&s;es braying, and
other ugly Noi&s;es which we did not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Upon this we reflected upon our own Indi&s;cre|tion,
that had not at lea&s;t brought Poles or Stakes
in our Hands, with which we might have, as it
were palli&s;adoed our &s;elves in for the Night;
and &s;o we might have &s;lept &s;ecure, whatever
other Inconveniences we &s;uffer'd. However, we
found a Way at la&s;t to relieve our &s;elves a little.
For fir&s;t we &s;et up the Lances and Bows we
had, and endeavoured to bring the Tops of them
as near to one another as we could, and &s;o hung
our Coats on the Top of them, which made us
a kind of a &s;orry Tent; the Leopard's Skin, and
<PB N="107" REF="109">
a few other Skins we had put together, made us
a tolerable Covering, and thus we lay down to
Sleep, and &s;lept very heartily too for the fir&s;t
Night, &s;etting however a good Watch, being two
of our own Men with their Fuzees, whom we re|liev'd
in an Hour at fir&s;t, and two Hours after|wards;
and it was very well we did this; for
they found the Wilderne&s;s &s;warm'd with raging
Creatures of all Kinds, &s;ome of which came di|rectly
up to the very Enclo&s;ure of our Tent. But
our Centinels were ordered not to alarm us with
Firing in the Night, but to fla&s;h in the Pan at
them, which they did, and found it effectual; for
the Creatures went off always as &s;oon as they &s;aw
it, perhaps with &s;ome Noi&s;e or Howling, and
pur&s;ued &s;uch other Game as they were upon.</P>
<P>If we were tired with the Day's Travel, we
were all as much tired with the Night's Lodging:
But our Black Prince told us in the Morning, he
would give us &s;ome Coun&s;el, and indeed it was
very good Coun&s;el. He told us we &s;hould all be
kill'd if we went on this Journey, and thro' this
De&s;art, without &s;ome Covering for us at Night;
&s;o he advi&s;ed us to march back again to a little
River Side where we lay the Night before, and
&s;tay there till we could make us Hou&s;es, as he
called them, to carry with us to lodge in every
Night. As he began a little to under&s;tand our
Speech, and we very well to under&s;tand his Signs,
we ea&s;ily knew what he meant, and that we
&s;hould there make Matts; (for we remembered
that we &s;aw a great deal of Matting, or Ba&s;s
there that the Natives make Matts of) I &s;ay,
that we &s;hould make large Matts there for Co|vering
our Hutts or Tents to lodge in at Night.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110">
We all approv'd this Advice, and immediately
re&s;olved to go back that one Day's Journey, re|&s;olving,
tho' we carried le&s;s Provi&s;ions, we would
carry Matts with us to cover us in the Night.
Some of the nimble&s;t of us got back to the River
with more Ea&s;e than we had travell'd it out the
Day before; but as we were not in Ha&s;te, the re&s;t
made a Halt, encamp'd another Night, and came
to us the next Day.</P>
<P>In our Return of this Day's Journey, our Men
that made two Days of it, met with a very &s;ur|prizing
thing, that gave them &s;ome Rea&s;on to
be careful how they parted Company again. The
Ca&s;e was this. The &s;econd Day in the Morning,
before they had gone Half a Mile, looking be|hind
them, they &s;aw a va&s;t Cloud of Sand or
Du&s;t ri&s;e in the Air, as we &s;ee &s;ometimes in the
Roads in Summer, when it is very du&s;ty, and a
large Drove of Cattel are coming, only very much
greater; and they could ea&s;ily perceive that it
came after them, and that it came on fa&s;ter than
they went from it. The Cloud of Sand was &s;o
great, that they could not &s;ee what it was that
rai&s;ed it, and concluded, that it was &s;ome Army of
Enemies that pur&s;ued them; but then con&s;idering
that they came from the va&s;t uninhabited Wil|derne&s;s,
they knew, it was impo&s;&s;ible any Na|tion
or People that Way &s;hould have Intelli|gence
of them, or of the Way of their March:
And therefore, if it was an Army, it mu&s;t be of
&s;uch as they were, travelling that Way by Acci|dent.
On the other Hand, as they knew that
there were no Hor&s;es in the Country, and that
they came on &s;o fa&s;t, they concluded, that it
mu&s;t be &s;ome va&s;t Collection of wild Bea&s;ts, per|haps
making to the Hill Country for Food or
<PB N="109" REF="111">
Water, and that they &s;hould be all devoured or
trampled under Foot by their Multitude.</P>
<P>Upon this Thought, they very prudently ob|&s;erved
which Way the Cloud &s;eem'd to point,
and they turned a little out of their Way to
the North, &s;uppo&s;ing it might pa&s;s by them.
When they were about a Quarter of a Mile, they
halted to &s;ee what it might be. One of the Ne|groes,
a nimbler Fellow than the re&s;t, went back
a little, and come again in a few Minutes, run|ning
as fa&s;t as the heavy Sand would allow, and
by Signs gave them to know, that it was a great
Herd or Drove, or whatever it might be called,
of va&s;t mon&s;trous Elephants.</P>
<P>As it was a Sight our Men had never &s;een, they
were de&s;irous to &s;ee it, and yet a little unea&s;y at
the Danger too; for tho' an Elephant is a heavy,
unwieldy Creature, yet in the deep Sand, which
was nothing at all to them, they marched at a
great Rate, and would &s;oon have tired our People,
if they had had far to go, and had been pur&s;ued
by them.</P>
<P>Our Gunner was with them, and had a great
Mind to have gone clo&s;e up to one of the outer|mo&s;t
of them, and to have clapt his Piece to his
Ear, and to have fired into him, becau&s;e he had
been told no Shot would penetrate them; but
they all di&s;&s;waded him, le&s;t, upon the Noi&s;e, they
&s;hould all turn upon, and pur&s;ue us; &s;o he was
rea&s;oned out of it, and let them pa&s;s, which in
our People's Circum&s;tance was certainly the right
Way.</P>
<P>They were between 20 and 30 in Number, but
prodigious great ones; and tho' they often &s;hew'd
our Men that they &s;aw them, yet they did not
turn out of their Way, or take any other Notice
<PB N="110" REF="112">
of them, than, <HI>as we might &s;ay,</HI> ju&s;t to look at
them. We that were before, &s;aw the Cloud of
Du&s;t they rai&s;ed, but we thought it had been
our own Carravan, and &s;o took no Notice; but
as they bent their Cour&s;e one Point of the Com|pa&s;s,
or thereabouts, to the Southward of the
Ea&s;t, and we went due Ea&s;t, they pa&s;s'd by us
at &s;ome little Di&s;tance; &s;o that we did not &s;ee
them, or know any thing of them till Evening,
when our Men came to us, and gave us this Ac|count
of them. However, this was a u&s;eful Ex|periment
for our future Conduct in pa&s;&s;ing the
De&s;art, as you &s;hall hear in its Place.</P>
<P>We were now upon our Work, and our Black
Prince was Head Surveyor, for he was an excel|lent
Matt-Maker him&s;elf, and all his Men under|&s;tood
it; &s;o that they &s;oon made us near a Hun|dred
Matts: And as every Man, I mean of the
Negroes, carried one, it was no Manner of Load,
and we did not carry an Ounce of Provi&s;ions the
le&s;s. The greate&s;t Burthen was to carry &s;ix long
Poles, be&s;ides &s;ome &s;horter Stakes; but the Ne|groes
made an Advantage of that, for carrying
them between two, they made the Luggage of
Provi&s;ions which they had to carry, &s;o much the
lighter, binding it upon two Poles, and &s;o made
three Couple of them. As &s;oon as we &s;aw this,
we made a little Advantage of it too; for having
three or four of our Baggs called Bottles, (I mean
Skins or Bladders to carry Water) more than the
Men could carry, we got them fill'd, and carried
them this Way, which was a Day's Water and
more for our Journey.</P>
<P>Having now ended our Work, made our Matts,
and fully recruited our Stores of all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
and having made us Abundance of &s;mall
<PB N="111" REF="113">
Ropes of Matting for ordinary U&s;e, as we might
have Occa&s;ion, we &s;et forward again, having
interrupted our Journey eight Days in all, upon
this Affair. To our great Comfort, the Night
before we &s;et out, there fell a very violent Show|er
of Rain, the Effects of which we found in the
Sand; tho' the Heat of one Day dry'd the Sur|face
as much as before, yet it was harder at Bot|tom,
not &s;o heavy, and was cooler to our Feet,
by which Means we march'd, as we reckoned,
about fourteen Miles in&s;tead of &s;even, and with
much more Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>When we came to encamp, we had all things
ready, for we had fitted our Tent, and &s;et it up
for Trial where we made it; &s;o that in le&s;s than
an Hour, we had a large Tent rai&s;ed, with an
Inner and Outer Apartment, and two Entrances.
In one we lay our &s;elves, in the other our Ne|groes,
having light plea&s;ant Matts over us, and
others at the &s;ame time under us. Al&s;o we had
a little Place without all for our Buffloes, for they
de&s;erved our Care, being very u&s;eful to us, be|&s;ides
carrying Forage and Water for them&s;elves.
Their Forage was a Root which our Black Prince
directed us to find, not much unlike a Pa&s;nip, ve|ry
moi&s;t and nouri&s;hing, of which there was Plen|ty
wherever we came, this horrid De&s;art ex|cepted.</P>
<P>When we came the next Morning to decamp,
our Negroes took down the Tent, and pull'd up
the Stakes, and all was in Motion in as little time
as it was &s;et up. In this Po&s;ture we march'd
eight Days, and yet could &s;ee no End, no Change
of our Pro&s;pect, but all looking as wild and di&s;|mal
as at the Beginning. If there was any Alte|ration,
it was, that the Sand was no where &s;o deep
<PB N="112" REF="114">
and heavy as it was the fir&s;t three Days. This
we thought might be, becau&s;e for &s;ix Months
of the Year the Winds blowing We&s;t, (as for
the other &s;ix, they blew con&s;tantly Ea&s;t) the
Sand was driven violently to the Side of the De&s;art
where we &s;et out, where the Mountains lying
very high, the Ea&s;terly <HI>Mon&s;oons,</HI> when they
blew, had not the &s;ame Power to drive it back
again; and this was confirm'd by our finding
the like Depth of Sand on the farthe&s;t Extent
of the De&s;art to the We&s;t.</P>
<P>It was the ninth Day of our Travel in this
Wilderne&s;s, when we came to the View of a great
Lake of Water, and you may be &s;ure this was
a particular Satisfaction to us, becau&s;e we had
not Water left for above two or three Days
more, at our &s;horte&s;t Allowance; I mean, al|lowing
Water for our Return, if we had been
driven to the Nece&s;&s;ity of it. Our Water had
&s;erved us two Days longer than we expected,
our Buffloes having found for two or three Days,
a kind of Herb like a Broad flat Thi&s;tle, tho'
without any Prickle, &s;preading on the Ground
and growing in the Sand, which they eat freely
of, and which &s;upplied them for Drink as well
as Forage.</P>
<P>The next Day, which was the tenth from our
&s;etting out, we came to the Edge of this Lake,
and very happily for us, we came to it at the
South Point of it, for to the North we could &s;ee
no End of it; &s;o we pa&s;&s;ed by it, and travelled
three Days by the Side of it, which was a great
Comfort to us, becau&s;e it lightened our Bur|then,
there being no need to carry Water, when
we had it in View; and yet, tho' here was &s;o
much Water, we found but very little Altera|tion
<PB N="113" REF="115">
in the De&s;art, no Trees, no Gra&s;s or Her|bage,
except that Thi&s;tle, as I call'd it, and two
or three more Plants, which we did not under|&s;tand,
of which the De&s;art began to be pretty
full.</P>
<P>But as we were refre&s;hed with the Neighbour|hood
of this Lake of Water, &s;o we were now
gotten among a prodigious Number of ravenous
Inhabitants, the like whereof, tis mo&s;t certain
the Eye of Man never &s;aw: For as I firmly believe,
that never Man, nor a Body of Men, pa&s;&s;ed this
De&s;art &s;ince the Flood, &s;o I believe there is not
the like Collection of fierce, ravenous, and de|vouring
Creatures in the World; I mean not in
any particular Place.</P>
<P>For a Day's Journey before we came to this
Lake, and all the three Days we were pa&s;&s;ing
by it, and for &s;ix or &s;even Days March after it,
the Ground was &s;cattered with Elephants Teeth,
in &s;uch a Number, as is incredible; and as &s;ome
of them may have lain there for &s;ome Hundreds
of Years, &s;o &s;eeing the Sub&s;tance of them &s;carce
ever decayes, they may lye there for ought I
know to the End of Time. The Size of &s;ome
of them is, it &s;eems, to tho&s;e to whom I have
reported it, as incredible as the Number, and I
can a&s;&s;ure you, there were &s;everal &s;o heavy, as
the &s;tronge&s;t Man among us could not lift. As
to Number, I que&s;tion not but there are enough
to load a thou&s;and Sail of the bigge&s;t Ships in the
World, by which I may be under&s;tood to mean,
that the Quantity is not to be conceived of;
&s;eeing that as they la&s;ted in View for above eighty
Miles Travelling, &s;o they might continue as far
to the right Hand, and to the left as far, and
many times as far, for ought we knew; for it
<PB N="114" REF="116">
&s;eems the Number of Elephants hereabouts is
prodigious great. In one Place in particular, we
&s;aw the Head of an Elephant, with &s;everal Teeth
in it, but one the bigge&s;t that ever I &s;aw: The Fle&s;h
was con&s;umed to be &s;ure many Hundred Years
before, and all the other Bones; but three of
our &s;tronge&s;t Men could not lift this Scull and
Teeth: The great Tooth, I believe, weighed at
lea&s;t 300 Weight, and this was particularly re|markable
to me, that I ob&s;erved the whole Scull
was as good Ivory as the Teeth, and I believe all
together weighed at lea&s;t 600 Weight, and tho'
I do not know but, by the &s;ame Rule, all the
Bones of the Elephant may be Ivory; yet I
think there is this ju&s;t Objection again&s;t it
from the Example before me, that then all the
other Bones of this Elephant would have been
there as well as the Head.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed to our Gunner, that &s;eeing we had
travelled now 14 Days without Intermi&s;&s;ion, and
that we had Water here for our Refre&s;hment,
and no Want of Food yet, or any Fear of it;
we &s;hould re&s;t our People a little, and &s;ee at
the &s;ame time, if perhaps we might kill &s;ome
Creatures that were proper for Food. The Gun|ner,
who had more Foreca&s;t of that kind, than
I had, agreed to the Propo&s;al, and added, why
might we not try to catch &s;ome Fi&s;h out of the
Lake? The fir&s;t thing we had before us, was
to try if we could make any Hooks, and this
indeed put our Artificer to his Trumps; how|ever,
with &s;ome Labour and Difficulty he did it,
and we catched fre&s;h Fi&s;h of &s;everal kinds. How
they came there, none but he that made the
Lake, and all the World, knows; for to be &s;ure
<PB N="115" REF="117">
no, human Hands ever put any in there, or
pulled any out before.</P>
<P>We not only catched enough for our pre&s;ent
Refre&s;hment, but we dried &s;everal large Fi&s;hes
of Kinds which I cannot de&s;cribe, in the Sun,
by which we lengthen'd out our Provi&s;ion con|&s;iderably;
for the Heat of the Sun dried them
&s;o effectually without Salt, that they were per|fectly
cured dry and hard in one Day's time.</P>
<P>We re&s;ted our &s;elves here five Days, during
which time we had Abundance of plea&s;ant Ad|ventures
with the wild Creatures, too many to
relate: One of them was very particular, which
was a Cha&s;e between a She Lion, or Lione&s;s, and
a large Deer; and tho' the Deer is naturally
a very nimble Creature, and &s;he flew by us like
the Wind, having perhaps about 300 Yards
the Start of the Lion, yet we found the Lion
by her Strength, and the Goodne&s;s of her Lungs,
got Ground of her. They pa&s;t by us within
about a Quarter of a Mile, and we had a View
of them a great Way, when having given them
over, we were &s;urprized about an Hour after, to
&s;ee them come thundering back again on the
other Side of us, and then the Lion was within
30 or 40 Yards of her, and both &s;training to the
Extremity of their Speed, when the Deer com|ing
to the Lake, plunged into the Water, and
&s;wam for her Life, as &s;he had before run for it.</P>
<P>The Lione&s;s plunged in after her, and &s;wam a
little way, but came back again; and when &s;he
was got upon the Land, &s;he &s;et up the mo&s;t
hideous Roar that ever I heard in my Life, as
if done in the Rage of having lo&s;t her Prey.</P>
<P>We walked out Morning and Evening con&s;tantly;
the Middle of the Day we refre&s;hed our &s;elves under
<PB N="116" REF="118">
our Tent; but one Morning early we &s;aw another
Cha&s;e, which more nearly concern'd us than the
other; for our Black Prince, walking by the
Side of the Lake, was &s;et upon by a va&s;t great
Crocodile, which came out of the Lake upon
him; and tho' he was very light of Foot, yet it
was as much as he could do to get away: He
fled amain to us, and the Truth is, we did not
know what to do, for we were told no Bullet
would enter her; and we found it &s;o at fir&s;t, for
tho' three of our Men fired at her, yet &s;he did
not mind them; but my Friend the Gunner,
a ventrous Fellow, of a bold Heart, and great
Pre&s;ence of Mind, went up &s;o near as to thru&s;t
the Muzzle of his Piece into her Mouth, and
fired but let his Piece fall, and run for it the
very Moment he had fired it: The Creature raged
a great while, and &s;pent its Fury upon the Gun,
making Marks upon the very Iron with her
Teeth, but after &s;ome time fainted and died.</P>
<P>Our Negroes &s;pread the Banks of the Lake
all this while, for Game, and at length killed
us three Deer, one of them very large, the other
two very &s;mall. There was Water-Fowl al&s;o in the
Lake, but we never came near enough to them
to &s;hoot any; and, as for the De&s;art, we &s;aw no
Fowls any where in it, but at the Lake.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e killed two or three Civet Cats, but
their Fle&s;h is the wor&s;t of Carrion; we &s;aw
Abundance of Elephants at a Di&s;tance, and ob|&s;erved,
that they always go in very good Com|pany,
that is to &s;ay, Abundance of them to|gether,
and always extended in a fair Line of
Battle; and this, they &s;ay, is the way they de|fend
them&s;elves from their Enemies; for if
Lions or Tygers, Wolves or any Creatures, at|tack
<PB N="117" REF="119">
them, they being drawn up in a Line,
&s;ometimes reaching five or &s;ix Miles in Length,
whatever comes in their Way is &s;ure to be trod
under Foot, or beaten in Pieces with their
Trunks, or lifted up in the Air with their
Trunks; &s;o that if a hundred Lions or Tygers were
coming along, if they meeta Line of Elephants,
they will always fly back till they &s;ee Room
to pa&s;s by to the Right Hand or to the Left;
and if they did not, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for
one of them to e&s;cape; for the Elephant, tho'
a heavy Creature, is yet &s;o dexterous and nim|ble
with his Trunk, that he will not fail to lift
up the heavie&s;t Lion, or any other wild Creature,
and throw him up in the Air quite over his Back,
and then trample him to Death with his Feet.
We &s;aw &s;everal Lines of Battle thus, we &s;aw
one &s;o long, that indeed there was no End of it
to be &s;een, and, I believe, their might be 2000
Elephants in a Row, or Line. They are not
Bea&s;ts of Prey, but live upon the Herbage of
the Field, as an Ox does, and, it is &s;aid, that
tho' they are &s;o great a Creature, yet that a
&s;maller Quantity of Forage &s;upplies one of them,
than will &s;uffice a Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Numbers of this kind of Creature that
are in tho&s;e Parts are inconceivable, as may be
gather'd from the prodigious Quantity of Teeth,
which as I &s;aid we &s;aw in this va&s;t De&s;art, and
indeed we &s;aw a 100 of them to one of any
other Kinds.</P>
<P>One Evening we were very much &s;urprized;
we were mo&s;t of us laid down upon our Matts to
Sleep, when our Watch came running in among
us, being frighted with the &s;udden Roaring of
&s;ome Lions ju&s;t by them, which it &s;eems they
<PB N="118" REF="120">
had not &s;een, the Night being dark, till they
were ju&s;t upon them. There was, as it proved,
an old Lion and his whole Family, for there was
the Lione&s;s and three young Lions, be&s;ides the
old King, who was a mon&s;trous great one: One
of the young ones, who were good large well
grown ones too, leapt up upon one of our Negroes,
who &s;tood Centinel, before he &s;aw him, at which
he was heartily frighted, cried out, and run
into the Tent: Our other Man, who had a
Gun, had not Pre&s;ence of Mind at fir&s;t to
&s;hoot him, but &s;truck him with the But-End
of his Piece, which made him whine a little,
and then growl at him fearfully; but the Fellow
retired, and we being all alarmed, three of our
Men &s;natched up their Guns, run to the Tent-Door,
where they &s;aw the great old Lion by the
Fire of his Eyes, and fir&s;t fired at him, but,
we &s;uppo&s;ed, mi&s;&s;ed him, or at lea&s;t did not
kill him; for they went all off, but rai&s;ed a
mo&s;t hideous Roar, which, as if they had called
for Help, brought down a prodigious Number
of Lions, and other furious Creatures, we know
not what about them, for we could not &s;ee them;
but their was a Noi&s;e and Yelling, and Howling,
and all &s;ort of &s;uch Wilderne&s;s Mu&s;ick on every
Side of us, as if all the Bea&s;ts of the De&s;art were
a&s;&s;embled to devour us.</P>
<P>We asked our Black Prince what we &s;hould
do with them? <HI>Me go,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>fright them all;</HI> &s;o
he &s;natches up two or three of the wor&s;t of our
Matts, and, getting one of our Men to &s;trike
&s;ome Fire, he hangs the Matt up at the End of
a Pole, and &s;et it on Fire, and it blazed abroad
a good while; at which the Creatures all moved
off, for we heard them roar, and make their
<PB N="119" REF="121">
bellowing Noi&s;e at a great Di&s;tance. Well, &s;ays
our Gunner, if that will do, we need not burn
our Matts, which are our Beds to lay under us,
and our Tilting to cover us. Let me alone, &s;ays
he, &s;o he comes back into our Tent, and falls to
making &s;ome artificial Fire-Works, and the like;
and he gave our Centinels &s;ome to be ready at
Hand, upon Occa&s;ion, and particularly he placed
a great Piece of Wild-fire upon the &s;ame Pole
that the Matt had been tied to, and &s;et it on
Fire, and that burnt there &s;o long, that all the
Wild Creatures left us for that time.</P>
<P>However, we began to be weary of &s;uch Com|pany,
and, to be rid of them, we &s;et forward
again two Days &s;ooner than we intended. We
found now, that tho' the De&s;art did not end,
nor could we &s;ee any Appearance of it, yet that
the Earth was pretty full of green Stuff, of one
&s;ort or another, &s;o that our Cattle had no Want.
And &s;econdly, that there were &s;everal little
Rivers which run into the Lake, and &s;o long
as the Country continued low, we found Water
&s;ufficient, which ea&s;ed us very much in our
Carriage, and we went on yet &s;ixteen Days more
without yet coming to any Appearance of better
Soil: After this we found the Country ri&s;e a little,
and by that we perceived, that the Water would
fail us, &s;o, for fear of the wor&s;t, we filled our
Bladder Bottles with Water; we found the Coun|try
ri&s;ing gradually thus for three Days conti|nually,
when, on the &s;udden, we perceived, that
tho' we had mounted up in&s;en&s;ibly, yet that
we were on the Top of a very high ridge of Hills,
tho' not &s;uch as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>When we came to look down on the other Side
of the Hills we &s;aw, to the great Joy of all our
<PB N="120" REF="122">
Hearts, that the De&s;art was at an End; that
the Country was clothed with Green, Abundance
of Trees, and a large River, and we made no
doubt but that we &s;hould find People and Cat|tel
al&s;o; and here, by our Gunner's Account,
who kept our Computations, we had marched
above 400 Miles over this di&s;mal Place of Hor|rour,
having been four and thirty Days a-doing of
it, and con&s;equently were come about 1100 Miles
of our Journey.</P>
<P>We would willingly have de&s;cended the Hills
that Night, but it was too late; the next Morn|ing
we &s;aw every thing more plain, and re&s;ted
our &s;elves under the Shade of &s;ome Trees;
which were now the mo&s;t refre&s;hing things imagi|nable
to us, who had been &s;corched above a
Month without a Tree to cover us. We found
the Country here very plea&s;ant, e&s;pecially con|&s;idering
that we came from, and we killed
&s;ome Deer here al&s;o, which we found very fre|quent
under the Cover of the Woods; al&s;o we
killed a creature like a Goat, who&s;e Fle&s;h was
very god to eat, but it was no Goat: We found
al&s;o a great Number of Fowls like Partridge,
but &s;omething &s;maller, and were very &s;ame, &s;o
that we lived here very well, but found no Peo|ple,
at lea&s;t none that would be &s;een, no not for
&s;everal Days Journey; and, to allay our Joy, we
were almo&s;t every Night di&s;turbed with Lions
and Tygers; Elephants indeed we &s;aw none
here.</P>
<P>In three Days March we came to a River,
which we &s;aw from the Hills, and which we
called the Golden River, and we found it run
Northward, which was the fir&s;t Stream we had
met with that did &s;o; it run with a very rapid
<PB N="121" REF="123">
current, and our Gunner pulling out his Map,
a&s;&s;ured me that this was either the River <HI>Nile,</HI>
or run into the great Lake; out of which the
River <HI>Nile</HI> was &s;aid to take its Beginning; and he
brought out his Carts and Maps, which by his
In&s;truction, I began to under&s;tand very well;
and told me, he would convince me of it, and
indeed he &s;eemed to make it &s;o plain to me, that
I was of the &s;ame Opinion.</P>
<P>But I did not enter into the Gunner's Rea&s;on
for this Enquiry, not in the lea&s;t, till he went
on with it farther, and &s;tated it thus; if
this is the River <HI>Nile,</HI> why &s;hould not we build
&s;ome more Canoes, and go down this Stream rather
than to expo&s;e our &s;elves to any more De&s;arts
and &s;corching Sands, in Que&s;t of the Sea, which
when we are come to, we &s;hall be as much
at a Lo&s;s how to get home as we were at
<HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI></P>
<P>The Argument was good, had there been no
Objections in the Way, of a Kind which none
of us were capable of an&s;wering; but upon the
whole it was an Undertaking of &s;uch a Nature,
that every one of us thought it impracticable,
and that upon &s;everal Accounts; and our Surgeon,
who was him&s;elf a good Scholar, and a Man of
Reading, tho' not acquainted with the Bu&s;ine&s;s
of Sailing, oppo&s;ed it; and &s;ome of his Rea&s;ons,
I remember, were &s;uch as the&s;e; fir&s;t, the Length
of the Way, which both he and the Gunner al|lowed
by the Cour&s;e of the Water and Turnings
of the River, would be at lea&s;t 4000 Miles. Se|condly,
The innumerable Crocodiles in the
River, which we &s;hould never be able to e&s;cape.
Thirdly, The dreadful De&s;arts in the Way;
and la&s;tly, the approaching rainy Sea&s;on, in which
<PB N="122" REF="124">
the Streams of the <HI>Nile</HI> would be &s;o furious, and
ri&s;e &s;o high, &s;preading far and wide over all
the plain Country, that we &s;hould never be able
to know when we were in the Channel of the
River, and when not, and &s;hould certainly be ca&s;t
away, over-&s;et, or run a-ground &s;o often, that it
would be impo&s;&s;ible to proceed by a River &s;o
exce&s;&s;ively dangerous.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Rea&s;on he made &s;o plain to us, that
we began to be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it our &s;elves; &s;o that
we agreed to lay that Thought a&s;ide, and proceed
in our fir&s;t Cour&s;e We&s;tward towards the Sea:
But as if we had been loath to depart, we conti|nued,
by way of refre&s;hing our &s;elves, to loy|ter
two Days upon this River, in which time
our Black Prince, who delighted much in wan|dering
up and down, came one Evening and
brought us &s;everal little Bits of &s;omething, he
knew not what; but he found it felt heavy, and
looked well, and &s;hewed it to me, as what he
thought was &s;ome Rarity. I took not much
Notice of it to him, but &s;tepping out, and call|ing
the Gunner to me, I &s;hewed it him, and told
him what I thought, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was certain|ly
Gold: He agreed with me in that, and al&s;o
in what follow'd, that we would take the Black
Prince out with us the next Day, and make him
&s;hew us where he found it, that if there was any
Quantity to be found, we would tell our Com|pany
of it, but if there was but little, we would
keep Coun&s;el, and have it to our &s;elves.</P>
<P>But we forgot to engage the Prince in the
Secret, who innocently told &s;o much to all the
re&s;t, as that they gue&s;&s;ed what it was, and came
to us to &s;ee; when we found it was publick, we
were more concerned to prevent their &s;u&s;pect|ing
<PB N="123" REF="125">
that we had any De&s;ign to conceal it, and
openly telling our Thoughts of it, we called our
Artificer, who agreed pre&s;ently that it was Gold;
&s;o I propo&s;ed, that we &s;hould all go with the
Prince to the Place where he found it, and if any
Quantity was to be had, we would lye here &s;ome
time, and &s;ee what we could make of it.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we went every Man of us, for no
Man was willing to be left behind in a Di&s;cove|ry
of &s;uch a Nature. When we came to the
Place, we found it was on the We&s;t Side of the
River, not in the main River, but in another &s;mall
River or Stream which came from the We&s;t, and
run into the other River at that Place. We fell
to raking in the Sand, and wa&s;hing it in our
Hands, and we &s;eldom took up a Handful of Sand,
but we wa&s;hed &s;ome little round Lumps as big as
a Pin's Head, or &s;ometimes as big as a Grape&s;tone,
into our Hands, and we found in two or three
Hours time, that every one had got &s;ome, &s;o
we agreed to leave off, and go to Dinner.</P>
<P>While we were eating, it came into my
Thoughts, that while we work'd at this Rate in
a thing of &s;uch Nicety and Con&s;equence, it was
ten to one if the Gold, which was the <HI>Make|bait</HI>
of the World, did not fir&s;t or la&s;t &s;et us
together by the Ears to break our good Arti|cles
and our Under&s;tanding one among another,
and perhaps cau&s;e us to part Companies, or
wor&s;e; I therefore told them, that I was indeed
the younge&s;t Man of the Company, but as they
had always allowed me to give my Opinion in
things, and had &s;ometimes been plea&s;ed to follow
my Advice, &s;o I had &s;omething to propo&s;e now,
which I thought, would be for all our Advantages,
and I believed they would all like it very well. I
<PB N="124" REF="126">
told them we were in a Country where we all
knew there was a great deal of Gold, and that
all the World &s;ent Ships thither to get it; that
we did not indeed know where it was, and &s;o we
might get a great deal, or a little, we did not
know whether; but I offered it to them to con|&s;ider
whether it would not be the be&s;t Way for
us, and to pre&s;erve the good Harmony and
Friend&s;hip that had been always kept among
us, and which was &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our
Safety, that what we found &s;hould be brought
together to one common Stock, and be equally
divided at la&s;t, rather than to run the Hazard of
any Difference which might happen among us,
from any one's having found more or le&s;s than an|other.
I told them, that if we were all upon one
Bottom, we &s;hould all apply our &s;elves heartily to
the Work, and be&s;ides that, we might then &s;et
our Negroes all to Work for us, and receive
equally the Fruit of their Labour, and of our own,
and being all exactly alike Sharers, there could
be no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Quarrel or Di&s;gu&s;t among us.</P>
<P>They all approv'd the Propo&s;al, and every one
jointly &s;wore, and gave their Hands to one ano|ther,
that they would not conceal the lea&s;t Grain
of Gold from the re&s;t; and con&s;ented, that if
any one or more &s;hould be found to conceal
any, all that he had &s;hould be taken from him,
and divided among the re&s;t: And one thing
more was added to it by our Gunner, from Con&s;i|derations
equally good and ju&s;t; that if any one
of us, by any Play, Bett, Game, or Wager, won
any Money or Gold, or the Value of any from
another, during our whole Voyage till our Return
quite to <HI>Portugal,</HI> he &s;hould be obliged by us all
to re&s;tore it again on the Penalty of being di&s;|arm'd,
<PB N="125" REF="127">
and turn'd out of the Company, and of
having no Relief from us on any Account what|&s;ever.
This was to prevent Wagering and Playing
for Money, which our Men were apt to do by &s;e|veral
Means, and at &s;everal Games, tho' they
had neither Cards or Dice.</P>
<P>Having made this whole&s;om Agreement, we
went chearfully to Work, and &s;hew'd our Ne|groes
how to work for us; and working up the
Stream on both Sides, and in the Bottom of the
River, we &s;pent about three Weeks Time dab|bling
in the Water; by which time, as it lay all
in our Way, we had gone about &s;ix Miles, and
not more; and &s;till the higher we went, the
more Gold we found; till at la&s;t, having pa&s;s'd by
the Side of a Hill, we perceived on a &s;udden,
that the Gold &s;topp'd, and that there was not a
Bit taken up beyond that Place; it pre&s;ently oc|curr'd
to my Mind, that it mu&s;t then be from
the Side of that little Hill that all the Gold we
found was work'd down.</P>
<P>Upon this, we went back to the Hill, and fell
to Work with that. We found the Earth loo&s;e,
and of a yellowi&s;h loamy Colour, and in &s;ome
Places, a white hard Kind of Stone, which in
de&s;cribing &s;ince to &s;ome of our Arti&s;ts, they tell
me was the Spar which is found by the Oar, and
&s;urrounds it in the Mine. However, if it had
been all Gold, we had no In&s;trument to force it
out; &s;o we pa&s;&s;ed that: But &s;cratching into the
loo&s;e Earth with our Fingers, we came to a &s;ur|prizing
Place, where the Earth for the Quantity of
two Bu&s;hels, I believe, or thereabouts, crumbled
down with little more than touching it, and ap|parently
&s;hewed us that there was a great deal of
Gold in it. We took it all carefully up, and
<PB N="126" REF="128">
wa&s;hing it in the Water, the loamy Earth wa&s;h'd
away, and left the Gold Du&s;t free in our Hands;
and that which was more remarkable, was, that
when this loo&s;e Earth was all taken away, and we
came to the Rock or hard Stone, there was not
one Grain of Gold more to be found.</P>
<P>At Night we came all together to &s;ee what we
had got, and it appeared we had found in that
Day's Heap of Earth, about Seven and Fifty
Pound Weight of Gold Du&s;t, and about Thirty
Four Pound more in all the re&s;t of our Works
in the River.</P>
<P>It was a happy Kind of Di&s;appointment to us,
that we found full Stop put to our Work;
for had the Quantity of Gold been ever &s;o &s;mall,
yet had any at all come, I do not know when we
&s;hould have given over; for having rummaged this
Place, and not finding the lea&s;t Grain of Gold in
any other Place, or in any of the Earth there,
except in that loo&s;e Parcel, we went quite back
down the &s;mall River again, working it over and
over again, as long as we could find any thing
how &s;mall &s;oever; and we did get &s;ix or &s;even
Pound more the &s;econd time. Then we went
into the fir&s;t River, and tried it up the Stream
and down the Stream, on the one Side and on the
other. Up the Stream we found nothing, no not
a Grain; down the Stream we found very little,
not above the Quantity of Half an Ounce in two
Miles working; &s;o back we came again to the
Golden River, as we ju&s;tly called it, and work'd
it up the Stream and down the Stream twice more
a-piece, and every time we found &s;ome Gold, and
perhaps might have done &s;o, if we had &s;tay'd
there till this time; but the Quantity was at la&s;t
&s;o &s;mall, and the Work &s;o much the harder,
<PB N="127" REF="129">
that we agreed by Con&s;ent to give it over, le&s;t we
&s;hould fatigue our &s;elves and our Negroes &s;o,
as to be quite unfit for our Journey. When we
had brought all our Purcha&s;e together, we had in
the whole three Pound and a Half of Gold to
a Man, Share and Share alike, according to &s;uch
a Weight and Scale as our ingenious Cutler made
for us to weigh it by, which he did indeed by
gue&s;s, but which, as he &s;aid he was &s;ure was ra|ther
more than le&s;s, and &s;o it prov'd at la&s;t; for
it was near two Ounces more than Weight in a
Pound. Be&s;ides this, there was &s;even or eight
Pound Weight left, which we agreed to leave in
his Hands, to work it into &s;uch Shapes as we
thought fit to give away to &s;uch People as we
might yet meet with, from whom we might have
Occa&s;ion to buy Provi&s;ions, or even to buy Friend|&s;hip,
or the like; and particularly we gave about
a Pound to our Black Prince, which he hammer'd
and work'd by his own indefatigable Hand, and
&s;ome Tools our Artificer lent him, into little
round Bits, as round almo&s;t as Beads, tho' not
exact in Shape, and drilling Holes thro' them,
put them all upon a String, and wore them about
his black Neck, and they look'd very well there
I a&s;&s;ure you; but he was many Months a-doing it.
And thus ended our fir&s;t Golden Adventure.</P>
<P>We now began to di&s;cover what we had not
troubled our Heads much about before; and that
was, that let the Country be good or bad that
we were in, we could not travel much farther, for
a con&s;iderable time. We had been now five Months
and upwards in our Journey, and the Sea&s;on
began to change; and Nature told us, that being
in a Climate that had a Winter as well as a Sum|mer,
tho' of a differing Kind from what our own
<PB N="128" REF="130">
Country produced, we were to expect a wet Sea|&s;on,
and &s;uch as we &s;hould not be able to travel in,
as well by rea&s;on of the Rain it &s;elf, as of the
Floods which it would occa&s;ion wherever we
&s;hould come; and tho' we had been no Stran|gers
to tho&s;e wet Sea&s;ons in the I&s;land of <HI>Mada|ga&s;car,</HI>
yet we had not thought much of them
&s;ince we begun our Travels; for &s;etting out when
the Sun was about the Sol&s;tice, that is, when it
was at the greate&s;t Northern Di&s;tance from us,
we had found the Benefit of it in our Travels.
But now it drew near us apace, and we found
it began to rain; upon which we called ano|ther
General Council, in which we debated
our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, and in particular,
whether we &s;hould go forward, or &s;eek for a pro|per
Place upon the Bank of our Golden River,
which had been &s;o lucky to us to fix our Camp
for the Winter.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it was re&s;olved to abide where
we were; and it was not the lea&s;t Part of our
Happine&s;s that we did &s;o, as &s;hall appear in its
Place.</P>
<P>Having re&s;olved upon this, our fir&s;t Mea&s;ures
were to &s;et our Negroes to Work, to make Hutts
or Hou&s;es for our Habitation; and this they did
very dexterou&s;ly; only that we changed the
Ground where we had at fir&s;t intended it, think|ing,
as indeed it happen'd, that the river might
reach it upon any &s;udden Rain. Our Camp was
like a little Town, in which our Hutts were in
the Center, having one large one in the Center of
them al&s;o, into which all our particular Lodgings
opened; &s;o that none of us went into our Apart|ments,
but thro' a publick Tent where we all eat
and drank together, and kept our Councils and
<PB N="129" REF="131">
Society, and our Carpenters made us Tables,
Benches, and Stools in Abundance, as many as
we could make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>We had no Need of Chimneys, it was hot
enough without Fire; but yet we found our &s;elves
at la&s;t oblig'd to keep a Fire every Night upon
a particular Occa&s;ion: For tho' we had in all
other Re&s;pects a very plea&s;ant and agreeable Sci|tuation,
yet we were rather wor&s;e troubled with
the unwelcome Vi&s;its of wild Bea&s;ts here, than in
the Wilderne&s;s it &s;elf; for as the Deer, and other
gentle Creatures came hither for Shelter and
Food, &s;o the Lions, and Tigers, and Leopards,
haunted the&s;e Places continually for Prey.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t we di&s;covered this, we were &s;o
unea&s;y at it, that we thought of removing our
Scituation; but after many Debates about it, we
re&s;olved to fortify our &s;elves in &s;uch a Manner, as
not to be in any Danger from it; and this our
Carpenters undertook, who fir&s;t pali&s;adoed our
Camp quite round with long Stakes (for we had
Wood enough) which Stakes were not &s;tuck in
one by another like Pales, but in an irregular
Manner; a great Multitude of them &s;o placed,
that they took up near two Yards in Thickne&s;s,
&s;ome higher, &s;ome lower, all &s;harpened at the
Top, and about a Foot a&s;under; &s;o that had
any Creature jump'd at them, unle&s;s he had gone
clean over, which it was very hard to do, he
would be hung upon twenty or thirty Spikes.</P>
<P>The Entrance into this, had larger Stakes than
the re&s;t placed &s;o before one another, as to make
three or four &s;hort Turnings, which no four|footed
Bea&s;t bigger than a Dog could po&s;&s;ibly
come in at; and that we might not be attack'd
by any Multitude together, and con&s;equently be
<PB N="130" REF="132">
alarm'd in our Sleep, as we had been, or be
oblig'd to wa&s;te our Ammunition, which we
were very chary of, we kept a great Fire every
Night without the Entrance of our Pali&s;ade, ha|ving
a Hutt for our two Centinels to &s;tand in
free from the Rain, ju&s;t within the Entrance, and
right again&s;t the Fire.</P>
<P>To maintain this Fire, we cut a prodigious
deal of Wood, and piled it upon a Heap to dry,
and with the green Boughs made a &s;econd Co|vering
over our Hutts, &s;o high and thick, that
it might ca&s;t the Rain off from the fir&s;t, and keep
us effectually dry.</P>
<P>We had &s;carce fini&s;hed all the&s;e Works, but
that the Rain came on &s;o fierce, and &s;o conti|nued,
that we had little time to &s;tir abroad for
Food, except indeed that our Negroes, who wore
no Clothes, &s;eem'd to make nothing of the Rain,
tho'to us <HI>Europeans</HI> in tho&s;e hot Climates, nothing
is more dangerous.</P>
<P>We continued in this Po&s;ture for four Months,
that is, from the Middle of <HI>June</HI> to the Middle
of <HI>October;</HI> for tho' the Rains went off, at lea&s;t
the greate&s;t Violence of them, about the <HI>Equinox,</HI>
yet as the Sun was then ju&s;t over our Heads, we
re&s;olved to &s;tay a while till it was pa&s;s'd us a little
to the Southward.</P>
<P>During our Encampment here, we had &s;everal
Adventures with the ravenous Creatures of that
Country, and had not our Fire been always
kept burning, I que&s;tion much whether all our
Fence, tho' we &s;trengthen'd it afterwards with
twelve or fourteen Rows of Stakes more, would
have kept us &s;ecure. It was always in the Night
that we had the Di&s;turbance of them, and &s;ome|times
they came in &s;uch Multitudes, that we
<PB N="131" REF="133">
thought all the Lions, and Tigers, and Leopards,
and Wolves of <HI>Africa</HI> were come together to at|tack
us. One Night being clear Moon&s;hine, one
of our Men being upon the Watch, told us, he
verily believed he &s;aw Ten Thou&s;and wild Crea|tures
of one Sort or another, pa&s;s by our little
Camp; and ever as they &s;aw the Fire, they &s;heer'd
off, but were &s;ure to howl or roar, or whatever
it was, when they were pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;ick of their Voices was very far from
being plea&s;ant to us, and &s;ometimes would be &s;o
very di&s;turbing, that we could not &s;leep for it;
and often our Centinels would call us, that were
awake to come and look at them. It was one windy
tempe&s;tuous Night after a very rainy Day, that
we were indeed all called up; for &s;uch innume|rable
Numbers of Devili&s;h Creatures came about
us, that our Watch really thought they would
attack us. They would not come on the Side
where the Fire was; and tho' we thought our
&s;elves &s;ecure every where el&s;e, yet we all got up,
and took to our Arms. The Moon was near the
Full, but the Air full of flying Clouds, and a
&s;trange Hurricane of Wind to add to the Terror
of the Night; when looking on the Back Part
of our Camp, I thought I &s;aw a Creature with|in
our Fortification, and &s;o indeed he was, except
his Haunches; for he had taken a running Leap,
I &s;uppo&s;e, and with all his Might had thrown
him&s;elf clear over our Pali&s;adoes, except one
&s;trong Pile which &s;tood higher than the re&s;t, and
which had caught hold of him, and by his Weight
he had hang'd him&s;elf upon it, the Spike of the
Pile running into his Hinder-Haunch or Thigh,
on the In&s;ide, and by that he hung growling and
biting the Wood for Rage. I &s;natcht up a Lance
<PB N="132" REF="134">
from on of the Negroes that &s;tood ju&s;t by me,
and running to him, &s;truck it three or four Times
into him, and di&s;patch'd him; being unwilling to
&s;hoot, becau&s;e I had a Mind to have a Volley fired
among the re&s;t, whom I could &s;ee &s;tanding with|out
as thick as a Drove of Bullocks going to a
Fair. I immediately called our People out, and
&s;hewed them the Object of Terror which I had
&s;een, and without any farther Con&s;ultation, fired
a full Volley among them, mo&s;t of our Pieces
being loaden with two or three Sluggs or Bullets
a-piece. It made a horrible Clutter among them,
and in general they all took to their Heels, on|ly
that we could ob&s;erve, that &s;ome walk'd off
with more Gravity and Maje&s;ty than others, be|ing
not &s;o much frighted at the Noi&s;e and Fire;
and we could perceive that &s;ome were left upon
the Ground &s;truggling as for Life, but we dur&s;t
not &s;tir out to &s;ee what they were.</P>
<P>Indeed they &s;tood &s;o thick, and were &s;o near
us, that we could not well mi&s;s killing or woun|ding
&s;ome of them, and we believe they had cer|tainly
the Smell of us, and of our Victuals we had
been killing; for we had killed a Deer, and three
or four of tho&s;e Creatures like Goats, the Day
before; and &s;ome of the Offal had been thrown
out behind our Camp, and this we &s;uppo&s;e drew
them &s;o much about us; but we avoided it for
the future.</P>
<P>Tho' the Creatures fled, yet we heard a fright|ful
Roaring all Night at the Place where they
&s;tood, which we &s;uppo&s;ed was from &s;ome that
were wounded; and as &s;oon as Day came, we went
out to &s;ee what Execution we had done, and,
indeed, it was a &s;trange Sight; there were three
Tygers and two Wolves quite killed, be&s;ides
<PB N="133" REF="135">
the Creature I had killed within onr Pali&s;ado,
which &s;eem'd to be of an ill-gendered kind, between
a Tyger and a Leopard. Be&s;ides this, there was a
noble old Lion alive, but with both his Fore Legs
broke, &s;o that he could not &s;tir away, and he
had almo&s;t beat him&s;elf to Death with &s;trugg|ling
all Night; and we found, that this was the
wounded Soldier that had roared &s;o loud, and
given us &s;o much Di&s;turbance: Our Surgeon,
looking at him, &s;miled; Now, &s;ays he, if I could
be &s;ure this Lion would be as grateful to me,
as one of his Maje&s;ty's Ance&s;tors was to <HI>Androni|cus</HI>
the <HI>Roman</HI> Slave, I would certainly &s;et both
his Legs again, and cure him. I had not heard
the Story of <HI>Andronicus,</HI> &s;o he told it me at large;
but as to the Surgeon, we told him, he had
no Way to know whether the Lion would do &s;o
or not, but to cure him fir&s;t, and tru&s;t to his
Honour; but he had no Faith; &s;o, to di&s;patch
him, and put him out of his Torment, he &s;hot
him into the Head, and killed him, for which we
called him the King-Killer ever after.</P>
<P>Our Negroes found no le&s;s than five of the&s;e
ravenous Creatures wounded and dropt at a
Di&s;tance from our Quarters; whereof, one was
a Wolf, one a fine &s;potted young Leopard, and
the other were Creatures that we knew not what
to call them.</P>
<P>We had &s;everal more of the&s;e Gentle-folks
about us after that, but no &s;uch general Rendezvous
of them as that was, any more; but this ill Effect
it had to us, that it frighted the Deer and
other Creatures from our Neighbourhood, of
who&s;e Company we were much more de&s;irous,
and who were nece&s;&s;ary for our Sub&s;i&s;tence:
However, our Negroes went out every Day a-Hunting,
<PB N="134" REF="136">
as they called it, with Bow and Arrow,
and they &s;carce ever failed of bringing us home
&s;omething or other; and particularly we found
in this Part of the Country, after the Rains had
fallen &s;ome time, Abundance of Wild-fowl, &s;uch
as we have in <HI>England;</HI> Duck, Teal, Widgeon,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ome Gee&s;e, and &s;ome Kinds that we had
never &s;een before, and we frequently killed them.
Al&s;o we catched a great Deal of fre&s;h Fi&s;h out
of the River, &s;o that we wanted no Provi&s;ion;
if we wanted any thing, it was Salt to eat with
our fre&s;h Meat, but we had a little left, and we
u&s;ed it &s;paringly for, as to our Negroes, they
would not ta&s;te it, nor did they care to eat any
Meat that was &s;ea&s;oned with it.</P>
<P>The Weather began now to clear up, the Rains
were down, and the Floods abated, and the Sun,
which had pa&s;&s;ed our Zenith, was gone to the
Southward a good Way, &s;o we prepared to go
on of our Way.</P>
<P>It was the 12th of <HI>October</HI> or thereabouts, that
we began to &s;et forward, and having an ea&s;y
Country to travel in, as well as to &s;upply us with
Provi&s;ions, tho' &s;till without Inhabitants, we
made more Di&s;patch, travelling &s;ome times, as we
calculated it 20 or 25 Miles a Day; nor did we
halt any were in eleven Days March, one Day
excepted, which was to make a Raft to carry
us over a &s;mall River, which having &s;welled
with the Rains was not yet quite down.</P>
<P>When we were pa&s;t this River, which by the
Way run to the Northward too, we found a great
Row of Hills in our Way; we &s;aw indeed the
Country open to the Right at a great Di&s;tance,
but as we kept true to our Cour&s;e due We&s;t, we
were not willing to go a great Way out of our
<PB N="135" REF="137">
Way, only to &s;hun a few Hills; &s;o we advanced;
but we were &s;urprized, when being not quite come
to the Top, one of our Company who with two
Negroes was got up before us, cry'd out the <HI>Sea!</HI>
the <HI>Sea!</HI> and fell a-dancing and jumping as Signs
of Joy.</P>
<P>The Gunner and I were mo&s;t &s;urprized at it,
becau&s;e we had but that Morning been calcu|lating,
that we mu&s;t have yet above a 1000 Miles
to the Sea-&s;ide, and that we could not expect to
reach it till an other rainy Sea&s;on would be
upon us, &s;o that when our Man cry'd out the
Sea, the Gunner was angry, and &s;aid he was
mad.</P>
<P>But we were both in the greate&s;t Surprize imagi|nable,
when coming to the Top of the Hill, and
tho' it was very high, we &s;aw nothing but Water,
either before us, or to the right Hand or the
left, being a va&s;t Sea without any Bound but the
Horizon.</P>
<P>We went down the Hill full of Confu&s;ion of
Thought, not being able to conceive where|abouts
we were, or what it mu&s;t be, &s;eeing by
all our Charts the Sea was yet a va&s;t Way off.</P>
<P>It was not above three Miles from the Hills
before we came the Shore, or Water-edge
of this Sea, and there, to our further Surprize,
we found the Water fre&s;h and plea&s;ant to drink;
&s;o that in &s;hort we knew not what Cour&s;e to
take: The Sea, as we thought it to be, put a
full &s;top to our Journey, (I mean We&s;tward) for
it lay ju&s;t in the Way. Our next Que&s;tion was
which Hand to turn to, to the Right or the
Left, but this was &s;oon re&s;olved; for as we
knew not the Extent of it, we con&s;idered that
our Way, if it had been the Sea really, mu&s;t be to
<PB N="136" REF="138">
the North; and therefore, if we went to the
South now, it mu&s;t be ju&s;t &s;o much out of our Way
at la&s;t: So having &s;pent a good Part of the Day
in our Surprize at the Thing, and con&s;ulting what
to do, we &s;et forward to the North.</P>
<P>We travelled upon the Shore of this Sea full
23 Days, before we could come to any Re&s;olu|tion
about what it was; at the End of which,
early one Morning, one of our Seamen cried
out Land, and it was no fal&s;e Alarm, for we &s;aw
plainly the Tops of &s;ome Hills at a very great
Di&s;tance, on the further Side of the Water, due
We&s;t; but tho' this &s;atisfied us that it was
not the Sea, but an Inland Sea or Lake, yet
we &s;aw no Land to the Northward, that is &s;o &s;ay,
no End of it; but were obliged to travel eight
Days more, and near a 100 Miles further, before
we came to the End of it, and then we found
this Lake or Sea ended in a very great River,
which run N. or N. by E. as the other River had
done, which I mention'd before.</P>
<P>My Friend the Gunner, upon examining, &s;aid,
that he believed that he was mi&s;taken before,
and that this was the River <HI>Nile,</HI> but was &s;till
of the Mind, that we were of before, that we
&s;hould not think of a Voyage into <HI>Egypt</HI> that Way;
&s;o we re&s;olved upon cro&s;&s;ing this River, which
however was not &s;o ea&s;y as before, the River
being very rapid, and the Channel very broad.</P>
<P>It co&s;t us therefore a Week here to get Mate|rials
to wa$t our &s;elves and Cattel over this
River; for tho' here were Store of Trees, yet
there were none of any con&s;iderable Growth,
&s;ufficient to make a Canoe.</P>
<P>During our March on the Edge of this Bank,
we met with great Fatigue, and therefore tra|vell'd
<PB N="137" REF="139">
fewer Miles in a Day than before, there
being &s;uch a prodigious Number of little Rivers
that came down from the Hills on the Ea&s;t Side,
emptying them&s;elves into this Gulph, all which
Waters were pretty high, the Rains having
been but newly over.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t three Days of our Travel we met
with &s;ome Inhabitants, but we found they lived
upon the little Hills, and not by the Water Side;
nor were we a little put to it for Food in this
March, having killed nothing for four or five
Days, but &s;ome Fi&s;h we caught out of the Lake,
and that not in &s;uch Plenty as we found before.</P>
<P>But to make us &s;ome amends, we had no Di&s;tur|bance
upon all the Shore of this Lake, from any
wild Bea&s;ts; the only Inconveniency of that Kind
was, that we met an ugly, venemous, deformed
kind of a Snake or Serpent in the wet Grounds
near the Lake, that &s;everal times pur&s;ued us, as if
it would attack us; and if we &s;truck at, or threw
any thing at it, would rai&s;e it &s;elf up, and hi&s;s
as loud it might be heard a great Way; it had
a helli&s;h, ugly, deformed Look and Voice, and
our Men would not be per&s;waded but it was the
Devil, only that we did not know what Bu&s;ine&s;s
Satan could have there, where there were no
People.</P>
<P>It was very remarkable that we had now tra|velled
a 1000 Miles without meeting with any
People, in the Heart of the whole Continent
of <HI>Africa,</HI> where to be &s;ure never Man &s;et his
Foot &s;ince the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> &s;pread them|&s;elves
over the Face of the whole Earth; here
al&s;o our Gunner took an Ob&s;ervation with his
Fore&s;taff to determine our Latitude, and he
found now, that having marched about 33 Days
<PB N="138" REF="140">
Northward, we were in 6 Degrees 22 Minutes
South Latitude.</P>
<P>After having with great Difficulty got over
this River, we came into a &s;trange wild Country,
that began a little to affright us; for tho' the
Country was not a De&s;art of dry &s;calding Sand,
as that was we had pa&s;&s;ed before, yet it was
mountainous, barren and infinitely full of mo&s;t
furious wild Bea&s;ts, more than any Place we had
pa&s;t yet. There was indeed a kind of coar&s;e
Herbage on the Surface, and now and then a
few Trees or rather Shrubs; but People we
could &s;ee none, and we began to be in great
Su&s;pen&s;e about Victuals; for we had not killed
a Deer a great while, but had lived chiefly upon
Fi&s;h and Fowl alway by the Water Side, both
which &s;eemed to fail us now; and we were in the
more Con&s;ternation, becau&s;e we could not lay in
a Stock here to proceed upon, as we did before, but
were obliged to &s;et out with Scarcity, and with|out
any Certainty of a Supply.</P>
<P>We had however no Remedy but Patience;
and having killed &s;ome Fowls, and dried &s;ome
Fi&s;h, as much as with &s;hort Allowance we reckon|ed
would la&s;t us five Days, we re&s;olved to ven|ture,
and venture we did; nor was it without
Cau&s;e that we were apprehen&s;ive of the Dan|ger,
for we travelled the five Days, and met
neither with Fi&s;h, or Fowl, or four-footed Bea&s;t
who&s;e Fle&s;h was fit to eat; and we were in a
mo&s;t dreadful Apprehen&s;ion of being fami&s;hed
to Death; on the &s;ixth Day we almo&s;t fa&s;ted,
or, as we may &s;ay, we eat up all the Scraps of
what we had left, and at Night lay down &s;up|perle&s;s
upon our Matts with heavy Hearts, be|ing
obliged the eighth Day to kill of one of our
<PB N="139" REF="141">
poor faithful Servants the Buffloes, that carry'd
our Baggage; the fle&s;h of this Creature was very
good, and &s;o &s;paringly did we eat of it, that it
la&s;ted us all three Days and a half, and was ju&s;t
&s;pent; and we were upon the point of killing
another, when we &s;aw before us a Country that
promi&s;ed better, having high Trees and a large
River in the middle of it.</P>
<P>This encouraged us, and we quicken'd our
March for the River Side, tho' with empty Sto|machs,
and very faint and weak; but before
we came to this River we had the good Hap to
meet with &s;ome young Deer, a Thing we had
long wi&s;hed for. In a Word, having &s;hot three
of them, we came to a full Stop to fill our Bellies,
and never gave the Fle&s;h time to cool before we
eat it; nay 'twas much we could &s;tay to kill it,
and had not eaten it alive, for we were in &s;hort
almo&s;t fami&s;hed.</P>
<P>Through all that unho&s;pitable Country we &s;aw
continually Lions, Tygers, Leopards, Civet Cats,
and Abundance of Kinds of Creatures that we
did not under&s;tand; we &s;ay no Elephants, but
every now and then we met with an Elephant's
Tooth lying on the Ground, and &s;ome of them
lying as it were half buried by the Length of
Time that they had lain there.</P>
<P>When we came to the Shore of this River,
we found it run Northerly &s;till, as all the re&s;t
had done, but with this Difference, that as the
Cour&s;e of the other Rivers were N. by E. or
N. N. E. the Cour&s;e of this lay N. N. W.</P>
<P>On the farther Bank of this River we &s;aw
&s;ome Sign of Inhabitants, but met with none
for the fir&s;t Day; but the next Day we came
into an Inhabited Country, the People all Ne|groes,
<PB N="140" REF="142">
and &s;tark naked, without Shame, both
Men and Women.</P>
<P>We made Signs of Friend&s;hip to them, and
found them a very frank, civil, and friendly &s;ort
of People. They came to our Negroes without
any Su&s;pition, nor did they give us any Rea&s;on
to &s;u&s;pect them of any Villainy, as the others
had done; we made Signs to them that we
were hungry, and immediately &s;ome naked
Women ran and fetched us great Quantities of
Roots, and of Things like Pumpkins, which
we made no Scruple to eat; and our Artificer
&s;hewed them &s;ome of his Trinkets that he had
made, &s;ome of Iron, &s;ome of Silver, but none
of Gold: They had &s;o much Judgment to chu&s;e
that of Silver before the Iron, but when we
&s;hewed them &s;ome Gold, we found they did not
value it &s;o much as either of the other.</P>
<P>For &s;ome of the&s;e Things they brought us
more Provi&s;ions, and three living Creatures as
big as Calves, but not of that Kind; neither did
we ever &s;ee any of them before; their Fle&s;h was
very good; and after that they brought us
twelve more, and &s;ome &s;maller Creatures, like
Hares, all which were very welcome to us who
were indeed at a very great Lo&s;s for Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>We grew very intimate with the&s;e People,
and indeed they were the civille&s;t and mo&s;t friend|ly
People that we met with at all, and mightily
plea&s;ed with us; and which was very particular,
they were much ea&s;ier to be made to under&s;tand
our Meaning, than any we had met with before.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, we began to enquire our Way, point|ing
to the We&s;t, they made us under&s;tand ea&s;ily
that we could not go that Way, but they
pointed to us, that we might go North-We&s;t,
<PB N="141" REF="143">
&s;o that we pre&s;ently under&s;tood that there was
another Lake in our Way, which proved to be
true; for in two Days more we &s;aw it plain, and
it held us till we pa&s;t the Equinoctial Line,
lying all the Way on our left Hand, tho' at
a great Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Travelling thus Northward, our Gunner
&s;eemed very anxious about our Proceedings; for
he a&s;&s;ured us, and made me &s;en&s;ible of it by
the Maps, which he had been teaching me out
of, that when we came into the Latitude of &s;ix
Degrees, or thereabouts, North of the Line, the
Land trended away to the We&s;t, to &s;uch a Length,
that we &s;hould not come at the Sea under a March
of above 1500 Miles farther We&s;tward than the
Country we de&s;ired to go to. I asked him if there
were no Navigable Rivers that we might meet
with, which running into the We&s;t Ocean, might
perhaps carry us down their Stream, and then if
it were 1500 Miles, or twice 1500 Miles, we might
do well enough, if we could but get Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Here he &s;hewed me the Maps again, and that
there appeared no River who&s;e Stream was of
any &s;uch Length as to do us any Kindne&s;s, till
we came perhaps within 2 or 300 Miles of the
Shore, except the <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> as they call it,
which lay farther Northward from us, at lea&s;t
700 Miles; and that then he knew not what
kind of Country it might carry us through; for
he &s;aid it was his Opinion, that the Heats on
the North of the Line, even in the &s;ame Latitude,
were violent, and the Country more de&s;olate,
barren, and barbarous than tho&s;e of the South;
and that when we came among the Negroes in
the North Part of <HI>Africa,</HI> next the Sea, e&s;pe|cially
tho&s;e who had &s;een and trafficked with
<PB N="142" REF="144">
the <HI>Europeans,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Dutch, Engli&s;h, Portugue&s;e,
Spaniards,</HI> &amp;c. that they had mo&s;t of them been &s;o
ill u&s;ed at &s;ome time or other, that they would
certainly put all the Spight they could upon
us in meer Revenge.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, he advi&s;ed us, that
as &s;oon as we had pa&s;&s;ed this Lake, we &s;hould
proceed W. S. W. that is to &s;ay, a little enclining
to the South, and that in Time we &s;hould meet
with the great River <HI>Congo,</HI> from whence the
Coa&s;t is called <HI>Congo,</HI> being a little North of <HI>An|gola,</HI>
where we intended at fir&s;t to go.</P>
<P>I asked him, if ever he had been on the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Congo;</HI> he &s;aid yes he had, but was never on
Shore there: Then I asked him, how we &s;hould get
from thence to the Coa&s;t where the <HI>European</HI>
Ships came, &s;eeing if the Land trended away
We&s;t for 1500 Miles, we mu&s;t have all that Shore
to traver&s;e, before we could double the We&s;t
Point of it.</P>
<P>He told me, it was ten to one but we &s;hould
hear of &s;ome <HI>European</HI> Ships to take us in, for
that they often vi&s;ited the Coa&s;t of <HI>Congo</HI> and
<HI>Angola,</HI> in Trade with the Negroes; and that if
we could not, yet, if we could but find Provi|&s;ions,
we &s;hould make our Way as well along
the Sea-Shore, as along the River, till we came
to the Gold Coa&s;t, which he &s;aid was not above
4 or 500 Miles North of <HI>Congo,</HI> be&s;ides the turn|ing
of the Coa&s;t We&s;t about 300 more; that
Shore being in the Latitude of &s;ix or &s;even De|grees,
and that there the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> or
<HI>French,</HI> had Settlements or Factories, perpaps all
of them.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I had more Mind all the while he ar|gued,
to have gone Northward, and Shipt our
<PB N="143" REF="145">
&s;elves in the <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> or as the Traders call it,
the River <HI>Negro,</HI> or <HI>Niger,</HI> for I knew that at la&s;t
it would bring us down to the <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI>
where we were &s;ure of Relief; whereas at the
Coa&s;t we were going to now, we had a prodigious
Way &s;till to go, either by Sea or Land, and no
Certainly which way to get Provi&s;ions but by
Force; but for the pre&s;ent I held my Tongue,
becau&s;e it was my Tutor's Opinion.</P>
<P>But when, according to his De&s;ire, we came
to turn Southward, having pa&s;&s;ed beyond the
&s;econd great Lake, our Men began all to be unea&s;y,
and &s;aid, we were now out of our Way for cer|tain,
for that we were going farther from home,
and that we were indeed far enough off al|ready.</P>
<P>But we had not marched above twelve Days
more, eight whereof was taken up in rounding
the Lake, and four more Southwe&s;t, in order to
make for the River <HI>Congo,</HI> but we were put to a|nother
full Stop, by entring a Country &s;o de&s;o|late,
&s;o frightful, and &s;o wild, that we knew not
what to think or do; for be&s;id&eacute;s that it appeared
as a terrible and boundle&s;s De&s;art, having neither
Woods, Trees, Rivers, or Inhabitants; &s;o even
the Place where we were, was de&s;olate of Inhabi|tants,
nor had we any Way to gather in a Stock
of Provi&s;ions for the pa&s;&s;ing this De&s;art, as we
did before at our entring the fir&s;t, unle&s;s we had
marched back four Days to the Place where we
turned the Head of the Lake.</P>
<P>Well, notwith&s;tanding this we ventured, for
to Men that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch wild Places as we
had done, nothing could &s;eem too de&s;perate to
undertake: We ventured I &s;ay, and the rather be|cau&s;e
we &s;aw very high Mountains in our way at a
<PB N="144" REF="146">
great Di&s;tance, and we imagined, wherever there
was Mountains, there would be Springs and
Rivers, where Rivers, there would be Trees, and
Gra&s;s, where Trees, and Gra&s;s, there would be
Cattel, and where Cattel, &s;ome Kind of Inha|bitants.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, in Con&s;equence of this &s;peculative Phi|lo&s;ophy,
we entered this Wa&s;t, having a great
Heap of Roots and Plants for our Bread, &s;uch as
the <HI>Indians</HI> gave us, a very little Fle&s;h, or Salt,
and but a little Water.</P>
<P>We travelled two Days towards tho&s;e Hills,
and &s;till they &s;eemed as far off as they did at fir&s;t,
and it was the fifth Day before we got to them;
indeed we travelled but &s;oftly, for it was exce&s;|&s;ive
hot, and we were much about the very
<HI>Equin$ctial</HI> Line, we hardly knew whether to the
South or the North of it.</P>
<P>As we had concluded that, where there were
Hills there would be Springs, &s;o it happened;
but we were not only &s;urprized, but really fright|ed,
to find the fir&s;t Spring we came to, and which
looked admirably clear and beautiful, be &s;alt
as Brine: It was a terrible Di&s;appointment to us,
and put us under melancholy Apprehen&s;ions at
fir&s;t; but the Gunner who was of a Spirit never
di&s;couraged, told us we &s;hould not be di&s;turbed at
that, but be very thankful, for Salt was a Bait we
&s;tood in as much Need of as any thing, and there
was no Que&s;tion but we &s;hould find fre&s;h Water
as well as Salt; and here our Surgeon &s;teps in
to encourage us, and told us, that if we did not
know, he would &s;hew us a Way how to make that
&s;alt Water fre&s;h, which indeed made us all more
chearful, tho' we wondered what he meant.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147">
Mean time our Men, without bidding, had
been &s;eeking about for other Springs, and found
&s;everal, but &s;till they were all &s;alt; from whence
we concluded, that there was a &s;alt Rock or Mi|neral
Stone in tho&s;e Mountains, and perhaps they
might be all of &s;uch a Sub&s;tance: But &s;till I won|dered
by what Witchcraft it was that our Ar|ti&s;t
the Surgeon would make this &s;alt Water
turn fre&s;h, and I long'd to &s;ee the Experiment,
which was indeed a very one one; but he went
to Work with as much A&s;&s;urance, as if he had
try'd it on the very Spot before.</P>
<P>He took two of our large Matts, and &s;ow'd
them togehter, and they made a kind of a Bag
four Foot broad, three Foot and a Half high,
and about a Foot and a Half thick when it was
full.</P>
<P>He cau&s;ed us to fill this Bag with dry Sand,
and tread it down as clo&s;e as we could, not to
bur&s;t the Matts. When thus the Bag was full
within a Foot, he &s;ought &s;ome other Earth, and
filled up the re&s;t with it, and &s;till trod it all in as
hard as he could. When he had done, he made
a Hole in the upper Earth, about as broad as the
Crown of a large Har, or &s;omething bigger about,
but not &s;o deep, and bad a Negroe fill it with
Water, and &s;till as it &s;hrunk away, to fill it again,
and keep it full. The Bag he had placed at fir&s;t
cro&s;s two Pieces of Wood, about a Foot from the
Ground, and under it he ordered &s;ome of our
Skins to be &s;pread, that would hold Water. In
about an Hour, and not &s;ooner, the Water began
to come dropping thro' the Bottom of the Bag,
and to our great Surprize, was perfect fre&s;h and
&s;weet; and this continued for &s;everal Hours: But
in the End, he Water began to be a little
<PB N="146" REF="148">
bracki&s;h. When we told him that, Well then,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> turn the Sand out, and fill it again;
whether he did this by way of Experiment from
his own Fancy, or whether he had &s;een it done
before, I do not remember.</P>
<P>The next Day we mounted the Tops of the
Hills, where the Pro&s;pect was indeed a&s;toni&s;hing;
for as far as the Eye could look, South, or
We&s;t, or North-We&s;t, there was nothing to be
&s;een but a va&s;t howling Wilderne&s;s, with neither
Tree or River, or any green thing. The Surface
we found, as the Part we pa&s;&s;ed the Day before,
had a kind of thick Mo&s;s upon it, of a blacki&s;h
dead Colour, but nothing in it that look'd like
Food, either for Man or Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>Had we been &s;tored with Provi&s;ions to have en|tred
for ten or twenty Days upon this Wilder|ne&s;s,
as we were formerly, and with fre&s;h Water,
we had Hearts good enough to have ventured;
tho' we had been obliged to come back again; for
if we went North, we did not know but we might
meet with the &s;ame; but we neither had Provi&s;i|ons,
neither were we in any Place where it was
po&s;&s;ible to get them. We killed &s;ome wild ferine
Creatures at the Foot of the&s;e Hills; but except
two things like to nothing that we ever &s;aw
before, we met with nothing that was fit to eat.
The&s;e were Creatures that &s;eemed to be between
the Kind of a Buffloe and a Deer, but indeed re|&s;embled
neither; for they had no Horns, and had
great Legs like a Cow, with a fine Head, and the
Neck like a Deer. We killed al&s;o at &s;everal times
a Tiger, two young Lions, and a Wolf, but, God
be thanked, we were not &s;o reduced as to eat
Carrion.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149">
Upon this terrible Pro&s;pect I renew'd my Mo|tion
of turning Northward, and making towards
the River <HI>Niger,</HI> or <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> then to turn We&s;t
towards the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlements on the Gold Coa&s;t,
to which every one mo&s;t readily con&s;ented, only
our Gunner, who was indeed our be&s;t Guide, tho'
he happen'd to be mi&s;taken at this time. He mo|ved,
that as our Coa&s;t was <HI>now</HI> Northward, &s;o we
might &s;lant away North We&s;t, that &s;o by cro&s;&s;ing
the Country, we might perhaps meet with &s;ome
other River that run into the <HI>Rio Grand</HI> North|ward,
or down to the Gold Coa&s;t Southward, and
&s;o both direct our Way, and &s;horten the Labour;
as al&s;o, becau&s;e, if any of the Country was inha|bited
and fruitful, we &s;hould probably find it
upon the Shore of the Rivers, where alone we
could be furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>This was good Advice, and too rational not to
be taken; but our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s was, what to
do to get out of this dreadful Place we were in;
behind us was a Wa&s;t, which had already co&s;t us
five Days March, and we had not Provi&s;ions for
five Days left to go back again the &s;ame Way.
Before us was nothing but Horrour as above, &s;o
we re&s;olv'd, &s;eeing the Ridge of Hills we were
upon had &s;ome Appearance of Fruitfulne&s;s, and
that they &s;eemed to lead away to the Northward
a great Way, to keep under the Foot of them
on the Ea&s;t Side, to go on as far as we could,
and in the mean time to look diligently out for
Food.</P>
<P>Accordingly we moved on the next Morning;
for we had no time to lo&s;e, and to our great Com|fort
we came in our fir&s;t Morning's March to ve|ry
good Springs of fre&s;h Water; and lea&s;t we
&s;hould have a Scarcity again, we filled all our
<PB N="148" REF="150">
Bladder Bottles, and carried it with us. I &s;hould
al&s;o have ob&s;erved, that our Surgeon who made
the &s;alt Water fre&s;h, took the Opportunity of
tho&s;e &s;alt Springs, and made us the Quantity of
three or four Pecks of very good Salt.</P>
<P>In our third March we found an unexpected
Supply of Food, the Hills being full of Hares;
they were of a kind &s;omething different from
ours in <HI>England,</HI> larger, and not &s;o &s;wift of Foot,
but very good Meat. We &s;hot &s;everal of them,
and the little tame Leopard, which I told you we
took at the Negroe Town that we plundered, hun|ted
them like a Dog, and killed us &s;everal every
Day; but &s;he would eat nothing of them unle&s;s we
gave it her, which indeed in our Circum&s;tance
was very obliging. We &s;alted them a little, and
dried them in the Sun whole, and carry'd a &s;trange
Parcel along with us, I think it was almo&s;t three
Hundred; for we did not know when we might
find any more, either of the&s;e, or any other Food.
We continued our Cour&s;e under the&s;e Hills very
comfortably eight or nine Days, when we found
to our great Satisfaction, the Country beyond us
began to look with &s;omething better Counte|nance.
As for the We&s;t Side of the Hills, we
never examin'd it till this Day, when three of our
Company, the re&s;t halting for Refre&s;hment,
mounted the Hills again to &s;atisfy their Curi|o&s;ity,
but found it all the &s;ame; nor could they
&s;ee any End of it, no not to the North, the Way
we were going; &s;o the tenth Day finding the Hills
made a Turn, and led as it were into the va&s;t De|&s;art,
we left them, and continued our Cour&s;e
North; the Country being very tolerably full of
Woods, &s;ome Wa&s;t, but not tediou&s;ly long; till
we came, by our Gunner's Ob&s;ervation, into the
<PB N="149" REF="151">
Latitude of 8 Degrees, 5 Minutes, which we
were nineteen Days more a performing.</P>
<P>All this Way we found no Inhabitants, Abun|dance
of wild ravenous Creatures, with whom
we became &s;o well acquainted now, that really
we did not much mind them. We &s;aw Lions
and Tigers, and Leopards every Night and Mor|ning
in Abundance; but as they &s;eldom came
near us, we let them go about their Bu&s;ine&s;s; if
they offer'd to come near us, we made fal&s;e Fire
with any Gun that was uncharged, and they
would walk off as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Fla&s;h.</P>
<P>We made pretty good Shift for Food all this
Way; for &s;ometimes we killed Hares, &s;ometimes
&s;ome Fowls, but for my Life I cannot give Names
to any of them, except a kind of Partridge, and
another that was like our Turtles. Now and then
we began to meet with Elephants again in great
Numbers, tho&s;e Creatures delighting chiefly in
the woody Part of the Country.</P>
<P>This long continued March fatigued us very
much, and two of our Men fell &s;ick, indeed &s;o
very &s;ick, we thought they would have died; and
one of our Negroes died &s;uddenly. Our Surgeon
&s;aid it was an Apoplexy, but <HI>he wondered at it,
he &s;aid,</HI> for he could never complain of his high
Feeding. Another of them was very ill, but our
Surgeon with much ado per&s;wading him, indeed
it was almo&s;t forcing him, to be let Blood, he re|cover'd.</P>
<P>We halted here twelve Days for the &s;ake of
our &s;ick Men, and our Surgeon per&s;waded me,
and three or four more of us, to be let Blood
during the time of Re&s;t, which with other things
he gave us, contributed very much to our conti|nued
<PB N="150" REF="152">
Health, in &s;o tedious a March, and in &s;o hot
a Climate.</P>
<P>In this March we pitched our matted Tents
every Night, and they were very comfortable
to us, tho' we had Trees and Woods to &s;helter
us al&s;o in mo&s;t Places. We thought it very
&s;trange, that in all this Part of the Country we
yet met with no Inhabitants; but the principal
Rea&s;on as we found afterwards was, that we ha|ving
kept a We&s;tern Cour&s;e fir&s;t, and then a
Northern Cour&s;e, were gotten too much into
the Middle of the Country, and among the De|&s;arts:
Whereas the Inhabitants are principally
found among the Rivers, Lakes, and Low-Lands
as well to the South-We&s;t, as to the North.</P>
<P>What little Rivulets we found here, were &s;o
empty of Water, that except &s;ome Pits, and
little more than ordinary Pools, there was
&s;carce any Water to be &s;een in them; and they
rather &s;hewed, that during the Rainy Months
they had a Channel, than that they had really
any running Water in them at that time: By
which it was ea&s;y for us to judge, that we had
a great Way to go; but this was no Di&s;courage|ment
&s;o long as we had but Provi&s;ions, and &s;ome
rea&s;onable Shelter from the violent Heat, which
indeed I thought was much greater now, than
when the Sun was ju&s;t over our Heads.</P>
<P>Our Men being recovered, we &s;et forward again,
very well &s;tored with Provi&s;ions and Water &s;uffi|cient,
and bending our Cour&s;e a little to the
We&s;tward of the North, travelled in Hopes of
&s;ome favourable Stream which might bear a Ca|noe;
but we found none till after twenty Days
Travel, including eight Days Re&s;t, for our Men
being weak we re&s;ted very often; e&s;pecially
<PB N="151" REF="153">
when we came to Places which were proper for
our Purpo&s;e; where we found Cattel, Fowl, or
any thing to kill for our Food. In tho&s;e twenty
Days March, we advanced four Degrees to the
Northward, be&s;ides &s;ome Meridian Di&s;tance We&s;t|ward,
and we met with Abundance of Elephants,
and with a good Number of Elephants Teeth
&s;catter'd up and down, here and there, in the
Woody Grounds e&s;pecially; &s;ome of which were
very large. But they were no Booty to us; our
Bu&s;ine&s;s was Provi&s;ions, and a good Pa&s;&s;age out of
the Country; and it had been much move to our
Purpo&s;e, to have found a good fat Deer, and to
have killed it for our Food, than a hundred Ton
of Elephants Teeth; and yet as you &s;hall pre|&s;ently
hear, when we came to begin our Pa&s;&s;age
by Water, we once thought to have built a
large Canoe on purpo&s;e to have loaded her with
Ivory, but this was when we knew nothing of
the Rivers, nor knew anything how dangerous, and
how difficult a Pa&s;&s;age it was that we were like
to have in them, nor had con&s;idered the Weight
of Carriage to lug them to the Rivers where
we might Embark.</P>
<P>At the End of twenty Days Travel, as above,
in the Latitude of three Degrees, &s;ixteen Minu|tes,
we di&s;covered in a Valley, at &s;ome Di&s;tance
from us, a pretty tolerable Stream, which we
thought de&s;erved the Name of a River, and
which run its Cour&s;e N. N. W. which was
ju&s;t what we wanted. As we had &s;ixt our Thoughts
upon our Pa&s;&s;age by Water, we took this for the
Place to make the Experiment, and bent our
March directly to the Valley.</P>
<P>There was a &s;mall Thicket of Trees ju&s;t in our
Way, which we went by, thinking no harm,
<PB N="152" REF="154">
when on a &s;udden one of our Negroes was very
dangerou&s;ly wounded with an Arrow, &s;hot into
his Back &s;lanting between his Shoulders. This
put us to a full Stop, and three of our Men with
two Negroes &s;preading the Wood, for it was
but a &s;mall one, found a Negro with a Bow,
but no Arrow, who would have e&s;caped; but our
Men that di&s;covered him, &s;hot him in Reven|ge
of the Mi&s;chief he had done; &s;o we lo&s;t the
Opportunity of taking him Pri&s;oner, which if we
had done, and &s;ent him home with good U&s;age,
it might have brought others to us in a friendly
Manner.</P>
<P>Going a little farther, we came to five Negro
Hutts or Hou&s;es, built after a differing Manner
from any we had &s;een yet; and at the Door of
one of them, lay &s;even Elephants Teeth piled
up again&s;t the Wall or Side of the Hutt, as if
they had been provided again&s;t a Market: Here
were no Men, but &s;even or eight Women, and
near twenty Children: We offered them no Unci|vility
or any kind, but gave them every one a
Bit of Silver beaten out thin, as I ob&s;erved be|fore,
and cut Diamond fa&s;hion, or in the Shape
of a Bird; at which the Women were over-joy'd
and brought out to us &s;everal Sorts of Food,
which we did not under&s;tand, being Cakes of
a Meal made of Roots, which they bake in the
Sun, and which eat very well. We went a little
Way farther, and pitched our Camp for that
Night, not doubting but our Civility to the
Women would produce &s;ome good Effect, when
their Husbands might come Home.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the next Morning, the Women,
with eleven Men, five young Boys, and two good
big Girls, came to our Camp; before they came
<PB N="153" REF="155">
quite to us, the Women called aloud, and made
an odd &s;creeking Noi&s;e, to bring us out, and
accordingly we came out, when two of the Wo|men,
&s;hewing us what we had given them, and
pointing to the Company behind, made &s;uch
Signs as we could ea&s;ily under&s;tand &s;ignified
Friend&s;hip. When the Men advanced, having
Bows and Arrows, they laid them down on the
Ground, &s;craped, and threw Sand over their
Heads, and turned round three times with their
Hands laid up upon the Tops of their Heads.
This it &s;eems, was a &s;olemn Vow of Friend&s;hip.
Upon this we beckon'd them with our Hands to
come nearer; then they &s;ent the Boys and Girls
to us fir&s;t, which, it &s;eems was to bring us more
Cakes of Bread, and &s;ome green Herbs, to eat,
which we receiv'd, and took the Boys up and ki&s;&s;ed,
them, and the little Girls too; then Men came
up clo&s;e to us, and &s;at them down on the Ground,
making Signs, that we &s;hould &s;it down by them,
which we did. They &s;aid much to one another,
but we could not under&s;tand them, nor could
we find any way to make them under&s;tand us;
much le&s;s whither we were going, or what we
wanted, only that we ea&s;ily made them under|&s;tand
we wanted Victuals; whereupon one of
the Men ca&s;ting his Eyes about him towards a
ri&s;ing Ground that was abut half a Mile off,
&s;tarts up as if he was frighted, flies to the Place
where they had laid down their Bows and Ar|rows,
&s;natches up a Bow and two Arrows, and
run like a race Hor&s;e to the Place: When he
came here, he let fly both his Arrows, and
comes back again to us with the &s;ame Speed;
we &s;eeing he came with the Bow, but without the
Arrows, were the more inqui&s;tive, but the Fellow
<PB N="154" REF="156">
&s;aying nothing to us, beckons to one of our Ne|groes
to come to him, and we bid him go; &s;o he led
him back to the Place, where lay a kind of a Deer,
&s;hot with two Arrows, but not quite dead; and,
between them, they brought it down to us. This
was for a Gift to us, and was very welcome, I
a&s;&s;ure you, for our Stock was low. The&s;e Peo|ple
were all &s;tark naked.</P>
<P>The next Day there came about a Hundred
Men to us, and Women, making the &s;ame aukward
Signals of Friend&s;hip; and dancing and &s;hewing
them&s;elves very well plea&s;ed, and any thing they
had they gave us. How the Man in the Wood
came to be &s;o butcherly and rude, as to &s;hoot at
our Men, without making any Breach fir&s;t, we
could not imagine; for the People were &s;imple,
plain, and inoffen&s;ive, in all our other Conver&s;a|tion
with them.</P>
<P>From hence we went down the Bank of the
little River I mentioned, and where I found we
&s;hould &s;ee whole Nations of Negroes, but whe|ther
friendly to us, or not, that we could make
no Judgment of yet.</P>
<P>The River was of no U&s;e to us, as to the De&s;ign
of making Canoes, a great while, and we tra|ver&s;ed
the Country, on the Edge of it about
five Days more, when our Carpenters finding
the Stream encrea&s;e, propo&s;ed to pitch our
Tents, and fall to work to make Canoes; but
after we had begun the Work, and cut down
two or three Trees, and &s;pent five Days in the
Labour, &s;ome of our Men wandring further
down the River, brought us Word, that the
Stream rather decrea&s;ed than encrea&s;ed, &s;inking
away into the Sands, or drying up by the Heat
of the Sun; &s;o that the River appeared not able
<PB N="155" REF="157">
to carry the lea&s;t Canoe, that could be any way
u&s;eful to us, &s;o we were obliged to give over our
Enterprize, and move on.</P>
<P>In our further Pro&s;pect this Way, we march'd
three Days full We&s;t the Country on the North
Side, being extraodinary mountainous, and more
parched and dry than any we had &s;een yet;
whereas, in the Part which looks due We&s;t, we
found a plea&s;ant Valley, running a great way
between two great Ridges of Mountains: The
Hills look'd frightful, being entirely bare of
Trees or Gra&s;s, and even white with the Drine&s;s
of the Sand; but in the Valley we had Trees,
Gra&s;s, and &s;ome Creatures that were fit for
Food, and &s;ome Inhabitants.</P>
<P>We pa&s;t by &s;ome of their Hutts or Hou&s;es,
and &s;aw People about them, but they run up into
the Hills as &s;oon as they &s;aw us; at the End of
this Valley we met with a peopled Country,
and at fir&s;t it put us to &s;ome doubt, whether
we &s;hould go among them, or keep up towards
the Hills Northerly; and as our Aim was prin|cipally,
as before, to make our Way to the River
<HI>Niger,</HI> we enclined to the latter, pur&s;uing our
Cour&s;e by the Compa&s;s to the N. W. We march'd
thus without Interruption &s;even Days more,
when we met with a &s;urprizing Circum&s;tance,
much more de&s;olate and di&s;con&s;olate than our
own, and, which, in time to come, will &s;carce
&s;eem credible.</P>
<P>We did not much &s;eek the conver&s;ing, or ac|quainting
our &s;elves with the Natives of the
Country, except where we found the Want of
them for our Provi&s;ion, or their Direction for
our Way; &s;o that whereas we found the Country
here begin to be very populous, e&s;pecially to|wards
<PB N="156" REF="158">
our left Hand, that is, to the South, we
kept at the more Di&s;tance Northerly, &s;till &s;tretch|ing
towards the We&s;t.</P>
<P>In this Tract we found &s;omething or other to
killand eat, which always &s;upplied our Nece&s;&s;ity,
tho' not &s;o well as we were provided in our fir&s;t
&s;etting out; being thus, as it were, pu&s;hing to
avoid the peopled Country, we at la&s;t came to a
very plea&s;ant, agreeable Stream of Water, not
big enough to be called a River, but running to
the N.N.W. which was the very Cour&s;e we
de&s;ired to go.</P>
<P>On the farthe&s;t Bank of this Brook we perceiv'd
&s;ome Hutts of Negroes not many, and in a little
low Spot of Ground &s;ome <HI>Mai&s;e</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn
growing, which intimated pre&s;ently to us, that
there were &s;ome Inhabitants on that Side, le&s;s bar|barous
than what we had met with in other
Places where we had been.</P>
<P>As we went forward our whole Carravan being
in a Body, our Negroes, who were in the Front,
cry'd out, that they &s;aw a <HI>White Man;</HI> we were not
much &s;urprized at fir&s;t, it being, as we thought, a
Mi&s;take of the Fellows, and asked them what
they meant; when one of them &s;tept to me,
and pointing to a Hutt on the other Side of the
Hill, I was a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee a White Man
indeed, but &s;tark naked, very bu&s;y near the
Door of his Hutt, and &s;tooping down to
the Ground with &s;omething in his Hand, as if he
had been at &s;ome Work, and his back being to|wards
us, he did not &s;ee us.</P>
<P>I gave Notice to our Negroes to make no Noi&s;e,
and waited till &s;ome more of our Men were come
up, to &s;hew the Sight to them, that they might be
&s;ure I was not mi&s;taken, and we were &s;oon &s;atis|fied
<PB N="157" REF="159">
of the Truth; for the Man having heard
&s;ome Noi&s;e, &s;tarted up, and looked full at us,
as much &s;urprized, to be &s;ure, as we were,
but whether with Fear or Hope, we then
knew not.</P>
<P>As he di&s;covered us, &s;o did the re&s;t of the Inha|bitants
belonging to the Hutts about him, and
all crouded together, looking at us at a Di&s;tance:
A little Bottom, in which the Brook ran, lying
between us, the white Man, and all the re&s;t,
as he told us afterwards, not knowing well whe|ther
they &s;hould &s;tay, or run away: However, it
pre&s;ently came into my Thoughts, that if there
were white Men among them, it would be much
ea&s;ier for us to make them under&s;tand what we
meant, as to Peace or War, than we found it with
others; &s;o tying a Piece of white Rag to the End
of a Stick, we &s;ent two Negroes with it to the
Bank of the Water, carrying the Pole up as
high as they could; it was pre&s;ently under&s;tood,
and two of their Men, and the white Man, came
to the Shore on the other Side.</P>
<P>However, as the white Man &s;poke no <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI>
they could under&s;tand nothing of one another,
but by Signs; but our Men made the white Man
under&s;tand, that they had white Men with
them too, at which they &s;aid the white Man
laught. However, to be &s;hort, our Men came
back, and told us they were all good Friends,
and in about an Hour four of our Men, two Ne|groes,
and the Black Prince went to the River
Side, were the white Man came to them.</P>
<P>They had not been half a Quarter of an Hour,
but a Negro came running to me, and told me
the white Man was <HI>Ingle&s;e,</HI> as he called him;
upon which I run back, eagerly enough you may
<PB N="158" REF="160">
be &s;ure with him, and found as he &s;aid, that he
was an <HI>Engli&s;hman;</HI> upon which he embraced
me very pa&s;&s;ionately, the Tears running down
his Face. The fir&s;t Surprize of his &s;eeing us
was over before we came, but any one may con|ceive
of it, by the brief Account he gave us after|wards
of his very unhappy Circum&s;tance; and
of &s;o unexpected a Deliverance, &s;uch as perhaps
never happened to any Man in the World; for it
was a Million to one odds, that ever he could
have been relieved; nothing but an Adventure
that never was heard or read of before, could
have &s;uited his Ca&s;e, unle&s;s Heaven by &s;ome Mi|racle
that never was to be expected, had acted
for him.</P>
<P>He appeared to be a Gentleman, not an ordi|nary
bred Fellow, Seaman, or labouring Man;
this &s;hewed it &s;elf in his Behaviour, in the fir&s;t
Moment of our conver&s;ing with him, and in
&s;pight of all the Di&s;advantages of his mi&s;erable
Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>He was a middle-aged Man, not above 37 or 38,
tho' his Beard was grown exceeding long, and the
Hair of his Head and face &s;trangely covered him
to the Middle of his Back and Brea&s;t, he was
white, and his Skin very fine, tho' di&s;coloured,
and in &s;ome Places bli&s;tered and covered with a
brown blacki&s;h Sub&s;tance, &s;curfy, &s;caly, and hard
which was the Effect of the &s;corching Heat of
the Sun; he was &s;tark naked, and had been &s;o,
as he told us, upwards of two Years.</P>
<P>He was &s;o exceedingly tran&s;ported at our meet|ing
with him, that he could &s;carce enter into
any Di&s;cour&s;e at all with us for that Day, and
when he could get away from us for a little,
we &s;aw him walking alone, and &s;hewing all the
<PB N="159" REF="161">
mo&s;t extravagant Tokens of an ungovernable
Joy; and even afterwards he was never without
Tears in his Eyes for &s;everal Days, upon the lea&s;t
Word &s;poken by us of his Circum&s;tances, or by
him of his Deliverance.</P>
<P>We found his Behaviour the mo&s;t courteous
and endearing I ever &s;aw in any Man whatever,
and mo&s;t evident Tokens of a mannerly well|bred
Per&s;on, appeared in all things he did or &s;aid;
and our People were exceedingly taken with him.
He was a Scholar, and a Mathematician; he
could not &s;peek <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> indeed, but he &s;poke
<HI>Latin</HI> to our Surgeon, <HI>French</HI> to another of our
Men, and <HI>Italian</HI> to a Third.</P>
<P>He had no Lei&s;ure in his Thoughts to ask us
whence we came, whither we were going, or
who we were; but would have it always as an
An&s;wer to him&s;elf, that to be &s;ure wherever
we were a-going, we came from Heaven, and were
&s;ent on purpo&s;e to &s;ave him from the mo&s;t
wretched Condition that ever Man was redu|ced
to.</P>
<P>Our Men pitching their Camp on the Bank
of a little River oppo&s;ite to him, he began to
enquire what Store of Provi&s;ion we had, and
how we propo&s;ed to be &s;upplied; when he found
that our Store was but &s;mall, he &s;aid he would
talk with the Natives, and we &s;hould have Pro|vi&s;ions
enough; for he &s;aid they were the mo&s;t
courteo us, good natured Part of the Inhabitants
in all that Part of the Country, as, we might
&s;uppo&s;e by his living &s;o &s;afe among them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t things this Gentleman did for us were
indeed of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to us; for
fir&s;t he perfectly informed us where we were,
and which was the propere&s;t Cour&s;e for us to
<PB N="160" REF="162">
&s;teer: &s;econdly, he put us in a Way how to fur|ni&s;h
our &s;elves effectually with Provi&s;ions; and
Thirdly, he was our compleat Interpreter and
Peace-maker with all the Natives, who now
began to be very numerous about us; and who
were a more fierce and politick People than
tho&s;e we had met with before; not &s;o ea&s;ily
terrified with our Arms as tho&s;e, and not &s;o
ignorant, as to give their Provi&s;ions and Corn
forour little Toys, &s;uch as I &s;aid before our
Artificer made; but as they had frequently traded
and conver&s;ed with the <HI>Europeans</HI> on the Coa&s;t,
or with other Negro Nations that had traded
and been concerned with them, they were the le&s;s
ignorant, and the le&s;s fearful, and con&s;equently
nothing was to be had from them but by Ex|change
for &s;uch things as they liked.</P>
<P>This I &s;ay of the Negro Natives, which we
&s;oon came among; but as to the&s;e poor Peo|ple
that he lived among, they were not much
acquainted with Things, being at the Di&s;tance
of above 300 Miles from the Coa&s;t, only that
they found Elephants Teeth upon the Hills to
the North, which they took and carried about
&s;ixty or &s;eventy Miles South, where other trading
Negroes u&s;ually met them, and gave them Beads
Gla&s;s, Shels, and Cowries for them, &s;uch as
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> and other Traders, furni&s;h
them with from <HI>Europe</HI>.</P>
<P>We now began to be more familiar with our new
Acquaintance; and fir&s;t, tho' we made but a &s;orry
Figure as to Clothes our &s;elves, having neither
Shoe, or Stocking, or Glove or Hat among us,
and but very few Shirts, yet as well as we could
we clothed him; and fir&s;t our Surgeon having
Sci&s;&s;ers and Razors, &s;haved him, and cut his
<PB N="161" REF="163">
Hair; a Hat, as I &s;ay, we had not in all our Stores,
but he &s;upply'd him&s;elf by making him&s;elf a cap
of a Piece of a Leopard Skin, mo&s;t artificially.
As for Shoes or Stockings, he had gone &s;o long
without them, that he cared not even for the Bus|kins
and Foot-Gloves we wore, which I de&s;cri|bed
above.</P>
<P>As he had been curious to hear the whole Story
of our Travels, and was exceedingly delighted
with the Relation; &s;o we were no le&s;s to know,
and plea&s;ed with the Account of his Circum&s;tance,
and the Hi&s;tory of his coming to that &s;trange
Place alone, and in that Condition, which we
found him in, as above.</P>
<P>This Account of his would indeed be in it &s;elf
the Subject of an agreeable Hi&s;tory, and would be
as long and as diverting as our own, having in
it many &s;trange and extraordinary Incidents,
but we cannot have Room here to launch out
into &s;o long a Digre&s;&s;ion; the Sum of his Hi&s;tory
was this.</P>
<P>He had been a Factor for the <HI>Engli&s;h Guiney</HI>
Company at <HI>Siera Leon,</HI> or &s;ome other of their
Settlements which had been taken by the <HI>French,</HI>
where he had been plundered of all his own Ef|fects,
as well as of what was intru&s;ted to him by
the Company. Whether it was, that the Com|pany
did not do him Ju&s;tice in re&s;toring his Cir|cum&s;tances,
or in further employing him, he
quitted their Service, and was employed by tho&s;e
they called Separate Traders; and being after|wards
out of Employ there al&s;o, traded on his
own Account; when pa&s;&s;ing unwarily into one of
the Company's Settlements, he was either betray'd
into the Hands of &s;ome of the Natives, or &s;ome
how or other was &s;urprized by them. Howe|ver,
<PB N="162" REF="164">
as they did not kill him, he found Means to
e&s;cape from them at that time, and fled to another
Nation of the Natives, who being Enemies to the
other, entertained him friendly, and with them
he lived &s;ome time; but not liking his Quarters,
or his Company, he fled again, and &s;everal times
changed his Landlords; &s;ometimes was carry'd
by Force, &s;ometimes hurried by Fear, as Cir|cum&s;tances
altered with him (the Variety of
which de&s;erves a Hi&s;tory by it &s;elf) till at la&s;t
he had wandred beyond all Po&s;&s;ibility of Return,
and had taken up his Abode where we found him,
where he was well received by the petty King of
the Tribe he lived with; and he, in Return, in|&s;tructed
them how to value the Product of their
Labour, and on what Terms to trade with tho&s;e
Negroes who came up to them for Teeth.</P>
<P>As he was naked, and had no Clothes, &s;o he
was naked of Arms for his Defence, having nei|ther
Gun, Sword, Staff, or any In&s;trument of
War about him, no not to guard him&s;elf again&s;t
the Attacks of a wild Bea&s;t, of which the Coun|try
was very full. We asked him how he came
to be &s;o entirely abandoned of all Concern for his
Safety? He an&s;wered, That to him that had &s;o
often wi&s;h'd for Death, Life was not worth de|fending;
and that as he was entirely at the Mer|cy
of the Negroes, they had much the more Con|fidence
in him, &s;eeing he had no Weapons to hurt
them. As for wild Bea&s;ts, he was not much con|cerned
about that; for he &s;carce ever went from
his Hutt; but if he did, the Negroe King and
his Men went all with him, and they were all ar|med
with Bows and Arrows, and Lances, with
which they would kill any of the ravenous Crea|tures,
Lions as well as others; but that they &s;el|dom
<PB N="163" REF="165">
came abroad in the Day; and if the Ne|groes
wander any where in the Night, they al|ways
build a Hutt for them&s;elves, and make a
Fire at the Door of it, which is Guard enough.</P>
<P>We enquired of him, what we &s;hould next do
towards getting to the Sea-&s;ide; he told us we
were about 120 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Leagues from the Coa&s;t,
where almo&s;t all the <HI>European</HI> Settlements and
Factories were, and which is called the Gold
Coa&s;t; but that there were &s;o many different Na|tions
of Negroes in the Way, that it was ten to
one if we were not either fought with continu|ally,
or &s;tarv'd for Want of Provi&s;ions: But that
there were two other Ways to go, which, if he
had had any Company to go with him, he had often
contrived to make his E&s;cape by. The one was
to travel full We&s;t, which, tho' it was farther to
go, yet was not &s;o full of People; and the People
we &s;hould find, would be &s;o much the civiller
to us, or be &s;o much the ea&s;ier to fight with: Or,
that the other Way was, if po&s;&s;ible, to get to the
<HI>Rio Grand,</HI> and go down the Stream in Canoes.
We told him, that was the Way we had re|&s;olved
on before we met with him; but then
he told us, there was a prodigious De&s;art to go
over, and as prodigious Woods to go thro,' be|fore
we came to it, and that both together were
at lea&s;t twenty Days March for us, travel as hard
as we could.</P>
<P>We ask'd him, if there were no Hor&s;es in
the Country, or A&s;&s;es, or even Bullocks or Buf|floes
to make u&s;e of in &s;uch a Journey, and we
&s;hewed him ours, of which we had but three left;
he &s;aid No, all the Country did not afford any
thing of that kind.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166">
He told us, that in this great Wood there
were innumerable Numbers of Elephants, and
upon the De&s;art, great Multitudes of Lions,
Linxes, Tygers, and Leopards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that it
was to that Wood, and to that De&s;art that the
Negroes went to get Elephants Teeth, where
they never failed to find a great Number.</P>
<P>We enquired &s;till more, and particularly the
Way to the Gold Coa&s;t, and if there were no
Rivers to ea&s;e us in our Carriage; and told
him, as to the Negroes fighting with us, we
were not much concern'd at that; nor were we
afraid of &s;tarving; for if they had any Victuals
among them, we would have our Share of it:
And therefore, if he would venture to &s;hew us
the Way, we would venture to go; and as for
him&s;elf, we told him we would live and dye
together, there &s;hould not a Man of us &s;tir from
him.</P>
<P>He told us, with all his Heart, if we re&s;olv'd
it, and would venture, we might be a&s;&s;ured he
would take his Fate with us, and he would en|deavour
to guide us &s;uch a Way, as we &s;hould
meet with &s;ome friendly Savages who would u&s;e
us well, and perhaps &s;tand by us again&s;t &s;ome
others who were le&s;s tractable: So, in a Word,
we all re&s;olved to go full South for the Gold
Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The next Morning he came to us again, and
being all met in Council, as we may call it, he
began to talk very &s;eriou&s;ly with us, that &s;ince
we were now come after a long Journey to a View
of the End of our Troubles, and had been &s;o ob|liging
to him, as to offer Carrying him with
us, he had been all Night revolving in his
Mind what he and we all might do to make
<PB N="165" REF="167">
our &s;elves &s;ome Amends for all our Sorrows;
and fir&s;t he &s;aid, he was to let me know, that
we were ju&s;t then in one of the riche&s;t Parts of
the World, tho' it was really otherwi&s;e, but a
de&s;olate, di&s;con&s;olate Wilderne&s;s; for &s;ays he,
there's not a River here but runs Gold, not a
De&s;art but without Plowing bears a Crop of Ivo|ry.
What Mines of Gold, what immen&s;e Stores
of Gold tho&s;e Mountains may contain, from
whence the&s;e Rivers come, or the Shores which
the&s;e Waters run by, we know not, but may
imagine that they mu&s;t be inconceivably rich, &s;ee|ing
&s;o much is wa&s;hed down the Stream by the
Water wa&s;hing the Sides of the Land, that the
Quantity &s;uffices all the Traders which the <HI>Euro|pean</HI>
World &s;end thither. We ask'd him how
far they went for it, &s;eeing the Ships only trade
upon the Coa&s;t. He told us, that the Negroes
on the Coa&s;t &s;earch the Rivers up for the Length
of 150 or 200 Miles, and would be out a Month
or two or three at a Time, and always come
Home &s;ufficiently rewarded; but, &s;ays he, they
never come thus far, and yet hereabouts is as
much Gold as there. Upon this he told us,
that he believed he might have gotten a Hun|dred
Pound Weight of Gold, &s;ince he came thi|ther,
if he had employed him&s;elf to look and
work for it, but as he knew not what to do
with it, and had long &s;ince de&s;paired of being
ever delivered from the Mi&s;ery he was in, he
had entirely omitted it. For what Advantage
had it been to me, &s;aid he, or what richer had
I been, if I had a Ton of Gold Du&s;t, and lay and
wallowed in it; the Richne&s;s of it, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> would not
give me one Moment's Felicity, or relieve me in
the pre&s;ent Exigency. Nay, &s;ays he, as you all &s;ee,
<PB N="166" REF="168">
it would not buy me Clothes to cover me, or a
Drop of Drink to &s;ave me from peri&s;hing. 'Tis
of no Value here, &s;ays he; there are &s;everal
People among the&s;e Hutts that would weigh Gold
again&s;t a few Gla&s;s Beads, or a Cockle-Shell, and
give you a Handful of Gold Du&s;t for a Hand|ful
of Cowries. <HI>N.B.</HI> The&s;e are little Shells
which our Children call Blackamores Teeth.</P>
<P>When he had &s;aid thus, he pulled out a Piece
of an earthen Pot baked hard in the Sun: Here
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> is &s;ome of the Dirt of this Country, and
if I would, I could have got a great deal more;
and &s;hewing it to us, I believe there was be|tween
two and three Pound Weight of Gold Du&s;t,
of the &s;ame Kind and Colour with that we had
gotten already, as before. After we had look'd
at it a while, he told us &s;miling, we were his De|liverers,
and all he had, as well as his Life, was
ours; and therefore, as this would be of Value
to us when we came to our own Country, &s;o he
de&s;ired we would accept of it among us, and that
this was the only time that he had repented
that he had pickt up no more of it.</P>
<P>I &s;poke for him as his Interpreter to my Com|rades,
and in their Names thank'd him; but
&s;peaking to them in <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> I de&s;ired them
to refer the Accepting his Kindne&s;s to the next
Morning, and &s;o I did, telling him we would far|ther
talk of this Part in the Morning; &s;o we
parted for that time.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I found they were all won|derfully
a&s;fected with his Di&s;cour&s;e, and with the
Genero&s;ity of his Temper, as well as the Magnifi|cence
of his Pre&s;ent, which in another Place had
been extraordinary. Upon the whole, not to
detain you with Circum&s;tances, we agreed, that
<PB N="167" REF="169">
&s;eeing he was now one of our Number, and that
as we were a Relief to him in carrying him out
of the di&s;mal Condition he was in, &s;o he was
equally a Relief to us, in being our Guide thro'
the re&s;t of the Country, our Interpreter with the
Natives, and our Director how to manage with
the Savages, and how to enrich our &s;elves with
the Wealth of the Country; that therefore we
would put his Gold among our common Stock,
and every one &s;hould give him as much as would
make his up ju&s;t as much as any &s;ingle Share of
our own, and for the future we would take our
Lot together, taking his &s;olemn Engagement to
us, as we had before one to another, that we
would not conceal the lea&s;t Grain of Gold we
found, one from another.</P>
<P>In the next Conference we acquainted him with
the Adventures of the Golden River, and how
we had &s;hared what we got there; &s;o that every
Man had a larger Stock than he for his Share;
that therefore in&s;ted of taking any from him, we
had re&s;olved every one to add a little to him. He
appeared very glad that we had met with &s;uch
good Succe&s;s, but would not take a Grain from
us, till at la&s;t pre&s;&s;ing him very hard, he told us,
that then he would take it thus: That when we
came to get any more, he would have &s;o much
out of the fir&s;t as &s;hould make him even, and
then we would go on as equal Adventurers; and
thus we agreed.</P>
<P>He then told us, he thought it would not be
an unprofitable Adventure, if before we &s;et for|ward,
and after we had got a Stock of Pro|vi&s;ions,
we &s;hould make a Journey North to the
Edge of the De&s;art he had told us of, from
whence our Negroes might bring every one a
<PB N="168" REF="170">
large Elephant's Tooth, and that he would get
&s;ome more to a&s;&s;i&s;t; and that after a certain
Length of Carriage, they might be conveyed by
Canoes to the Coa&s;t, where they would yield a
very great Profit.</P>
<P>I objected again&s;t this, on Account of our other
De&s;ign we had of getting Gold Du&s;t; and that
our Negroes, who, we knew would be faithful
to us, would get much more by &s;earching the
Rivers for Gold for us, than by lugging a great
Tooth of an Hundred and &s;ifty Pound Weight, a
Hundred Mile, or more, which would be an
un&s;ufferable Labour to them after &s;o hard a Jour|ney,
and would certainly kill them.</P>
<P>He acquie&s;ced in the Ju&s;tice of this An&s;wer,
but fain would have had us gone to &s;ee the
woody Part of the Hills, and the Edge of the
De&s;art, that we might &s;ee how the Elephants
Teeth lay &s;cattered up and down there; but
when we told him the Story of what we had &s;een
before, as is &s;aid above, he &s;aid no more.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd here twelve Days, during which
Time the Natives were very obliging to us, and
brought us Fruits, Pompions, and a Root like
Carrots, tho' of quite another Ta&s;te, but not
unplea&s;ant neither, and &s;ome <HI>Guiney</HI> Fowls who&s;e
Names we did not know. In &s;hort, they brought
us Plenty of what they had, and we lived very
well, and we gave them all &s;uch little Things as
our Cutler had made, for he had now a whole
Bag full of them.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth Day we &s;et forward, taking
our new Gentleman with us. At Parting, the
Negroe King &s;ent two Savages with a Pre&s;ent
to him, of &s;ome dried Fle&s;h, but I do not remem|ber
what it was, and he gave him again three
<PB N="169" REF="171">
Silver Birds which our Cutler help'd him to,
which I a&s;&s;ure you was a Pre&s;ent for a King.</P>
<P>We travelled now South, a little We&s;t, and
here we found the fir&s;t River for above 2000
Miles March, who&s;e Water run South, all the
re&s;t running North or We&s;t. We followed this
River, which was no bigger than a good large
Brook in <HI>England,</HI> till it began to encrea&s;e its
Water. Every now and then we found our <HI>Eng|li&s;hman</HI>
went down as it were privately to the
Water, which was to try the Land. At Length,
after a Day's March upon this River, he came
running up to us with his Hands full Sand, and
&s;aying <HI>Look here.</HI> Upon looking, we found that a
good deal of Gold lay &s;pangled among the Sand
of the River. Now, &s;ays he, I think we may
begin to work; &s;o he divided our Negroes in|to
Couples, and &s;et them to Work, to &s;earch and
wa&s;h the Sand and Ooze in the Bottom of the
Water where it was not deep.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Day and a Quarter, our Men all
together had gathered a Pound and two Ounces
of Gold, or thereabouts; and as we found the
Quantity encrea&s;ed, the farther we went, we
followed it about three Days, till another &s;mall
Rivulet join'd the fir&s;t, and then &s;earching up
the Stream, we found Gold there too; &s;o we
pitch'd our Camp in the Angle where the Ri|vers
join'd, and we diverted our &s;elves, as I may
call it, in wa&s;hing the Gold out of the Sand of
the River, and in getting Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Here we &s;tay'd thirteen Days more, in which
time we had many plea&s;ant Adventures with the
Savages, too long to mention here, and &s;ome of
them too homely to tell off; for &s;ome of our Men
had made &s;omething free with their Women,
<PB N="170" REF="172">
which, had not our new Guide made Peace for
us with one of their Men, at the Price of &s;even
fine Bits of Silver, which our Artificer had cut
out into the Shapes of Lions, and Fi&s;hes, and
Birds, and had punch'd Holes to hang them up
by (an ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure!) we mu&s;t have gone
to War with them and all their People.</P>
<P>All the while we were bu&s;y wa&s;hing Gold Du&s;t
out of the Rivers, and our Negroes the like, our
ingenious Cutler was hammering and cutting, and
he was grown &s;o dexterous by U&s;e, that he for|med
all Manner of Images. He cut out Ele|phants,
Tygers, Civet Cats, O&s;triches, Eagles,
Cranes, Fowls, Fi&s;hes, and indeed whatever he
plea&s;ed, in thin Plates of hammer'd Gold, for
his Silver and Iron was almo&s;t all gone.</P>
<P>At one of the Towns of the&s;e Savage Nati|ons
we were very friendly received by their
King; and as he was very much taken with our
Workman's Toys, he &s;old him an Elephant cut
out of a Gold Plate as thin as a Six-pence, at
an extravagant Rate. He was &s;o much taken
with it, that he would not be quiet till he had
given him almo&s;t a Handful of Gold Du&s;t, as
they call it. I &s;uppo&s;e it might weigh three
Quarters of a Pound; the Piece of Gold that
the Elephant was made of, might be about the
Weight of a Pi&s;tole, rather le&s;s than more. Our
Arti&s;t was &s;o hone&s;t, tho' the Labour and Art was
all his own, that he brought all the Gold, and
put it into our common Stock: But we had indeed
no Manner of Rea&s;on in the lea&s;t to be cove|tous;
for, as our new Guide told us, we that
were &s;trong enough to defend our &s;elves, and
had Time enough to &s;tay (for we were none of
us in Ha&s;te) might in time get together what
<PB N="171" REF="173">
Quantity of Gold we plea&s;ed, even to an Hun|dred
Pound Weight a Man, if we thought fit; and
therefore he told us, tho' he had as much Rea&s;on
to be &s;ick of the Country as any of us, yet if we
thought to turn our March a little to the South-Ea&s;t,
and pitch upon a Place proper for our
Head Quarters, we might find Provi&s;ions plenty
enough, and extend our &s;elves over the Country
among the Rivers for two or three Year to the
Right and Left, and we &s;hould &s;oon find the Ad|vantage
of it.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;al, however good as to the profita|ble
Part of it, &s;uited none of us; for we were all
more de&s;irous to get Home, than to be rich, be|ing
tired of the exce&s;&s;ive Fatigue of above a Year's
continual Wandring among De&s;arts and wild
Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>However, the Tongue of our new Acquain|tance
had a Kind of Charm in it, and u&s;ed
&s;uch Arguments, and had &s;o much the Power of
Per&s;wa&s;ion, that there was no re&s;i&s;ting him. He
told us, it was prepo&s;terous not to take the Fruit
of all our Labours, now we were come to the
Harve&s;t; that we might &s;ee the Hazard the
<HI>Europeans</HI> run, with Ships and Men, and at great
Expence, to fetch a little Gold; and that we
that were in the Center of it, to go away em|pty
handed, was unaccountable; that we were
&s;trong enough to fight our Way thro' whole
Nations, and might make our Journey afterward
to what Part of the Coa&s;t we plea&s;ed; and we
&s;hould never forgive our &s;elves when we came
to our own Country, to &s;ee we had 500 Pi&s;toles
in Gold, and might as ea&s;ily have had 5000, or
10000, or what we plea&s;ed; that he was no more
covetous than we, but &s;eeing it was in all our
<PB N="172" REF="174">
Powers to retrieve our Misfortunes at once, and
to make our &s;elves ea&s;y for all our Lives, he
could not be faithful to us, or grateful for the
Good we had done him, if he did not let us &s;ee
the Advantage we had in our Hands; and he
a&s;&s;ured us, he would make it clear to our own
Under&s;tanding, that we might in two Years time,
by good Management, and by the Help of our
Negroes, gather every Man a Hundred Pound
Weight of Gold, and get together perhaps two
Hundred Ton of Teeth: Whereas, if once we
pu&s;h'd on to the Coa&s;t, and &s;eparated, we &s;hould
never be able to &s;ee that Place again with our
Eyes, or do any more than Sinners did with Hea|ven,
wi&s;h them&s;elves there, but know they can
never come at it.</P>
<P>Our Surgeon was the fir&s;t Man that yielded to
his Rea&s;oning, and after him the Gunner; and
they two indeed had a great Influence over us, but
none of the re&s;t had any Mind to &s;tay, nor I nei|ther,
I mu&s;t confe&s;s; for I had no Notion of a
great deal of Money, or what to do with my &s;elf,
or what to do with it if I had it. I thought I had
enough already, and all the Thoughts I had about
di&s;po&s;ing of it, if I came to <HI>Europe,</HI> was only how
to &s;pend it as fa&s;t as I could, buy me &s;ome Clothes,
and go to Sea again to be a Drudge for more.</P>
<P>However, he prevailed with us by his good
Words at la&s;t, to &s;tay but for &s;ix Months in the
Country, and then, if we did re&s;olve to go, he
would &s;ubmit: So at length we yielded to that,
and he carry'd us about fifty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles South-Ea&s;t,
where we found &s;everal Rivulets of Water,
which &s;eem'd to come all from a great Ridge of
Mountains, which lay to the North-Ea&s;t, and
which, by our Calculation, mu&s;t be the Beginning
<PB N="173" REF="175">
that Way of the great Wa&s;t, which we had been
forc'd Northward to avoid.</P>
<P>Here we found the Country barren enough,
but yet we had, by his Direction, Plenty of Food;
for the Savages round us, upon giving them &s;ome
of our Toys, as I have &s;o often mentioned, brought
us in whatever they had: And here we found
&s;ome Mai&s;e, or <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat, which the Negroe
Women planted, as we &s;ow Seeds in a Garden,
and immediately our new Proveditor ordered
&s;ome of our Negroes to plant it, and it grew up
pre&s;ently, and by watering it often, we had a
Crop in le&s;s than three Months Growth.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were &s;ettled, and our Camp
fix'd, we fell to the old Trade of Fi&s;hing for Gold
in the Rivers mentioned above; and our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Gentleman &s;o well knew how to direct our Search,
that we &s;carce ever lo&s;t our Labour.</P>
<P>One time, having &s;et us to Work, he asked, if
we would give him Leave, with four or five Ne|groes,
to go out for &s;ix or &s;even Days, to &s;eek his
Fortune, and &s;ee what he could di&s;cover in the
Country, a&s;&s;uring us, whatever he got &s;hould be
for the publick Stock. We all gave him our Con|&s;ent,
lent him a Gun; and two of our Men de|&s;iring
to go with him, they took then &s;ix Ne|groes
with them, and two of our Buffloes that
came with us the whole Journey; they took about
eight Days Provi&s;ion of Bread with them, but
no Fle&s;h, except about as much dried Fle&s;h as
would &s;erve them two Days.</P>
<P>They travelled up to the Top of the Moun|tains
I mentioned ju&s;t now, where they &s;aw, (as
our Men afterwards vouch'd it to be) the &s;ame
De&s;art which we were &s;o ju&s;tly terrified at, when
we were on the further Side, and which, by our
<PB N="174" REF="176">
Calculation, could not be le&s;s than 300 Miles
broad, and above 600 Miles in Length, without
knowing where it ended.</P>
<P>The Journal of their Travels is too long to
enter upon here; they &s;tayed out two and fifty
Days, when they brought us &s;eventeen Pound,
and &s;omething more (for we had no exact Weight)
of Gold Du&s;t, &s;ome of it in much larger Pieces
than any we found before; be&s;ides about fifteen
Ton of Elephants Teeth, which he had, partly
by good U&s;age, and partly by bad, obliged the
Savages of the Country to fetch, and bring down
to him from the Mountains, and which he made
others bring with him quite down to our Camp.
Indeed we wondered what was coming to us,
when we &s;aw him attended with above 200 Ne|groes;
but he &s;oon undeceived us, when he made
them all throw down their Burthens on a Heap,
at the Entrance of our Camp.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, they brought two Lions Skins,
and five Leopards Skins, very large and very fine.
He asked our Pardon for his long Stay, and that
he had made no greater a Booty, but told us, he
had one Excur&s;ion more to make, which he hop'd
&s;hould turn to a better Account.</P>
<P>So having re&s;ted him&s;elf, and rewarded the
Savages that brought the Teeth for him, with
&s;ome Bits of Silver and Iron cut out Diamond
Fa&s;hion, and with two &s;hap'd like little Dogs, he
&s;ent them away mightily plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Journey he went, &s;ome more of
our Men de&s;ired to go with him, and they made
a Troop of ten white Men, and ten Savages, and
the two Buffloes to carry their Provi&s;ions and
Ammunition. They took the &s;ame Cour&s;e, on|ly
not exactly the &s;ame Tract, and they &s;tay'd
<PB N="175" REF="177">
thirty two Days only, in which time they killed
no le&s;s than fifteen Leopards, three Lions, and
&s;everal other Creatures, and brought us Home
four and twenty Pound, &s;ome Ounces of Gold
Du&s;t, and only &s;ix Elephants Teeth, but they
were very great ones.</P>
<P>Our Friend the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> &s;hewed us now, that
our Time was well be&s;tow'd; for in five Months
which we had &s;tayed here, we had gathered &s;o
much Gold Du&s;t, that when we came to &s;hare it,
we had five Pound and Quarter to a Man, be|&s;ides
what we had before, and be&s;ides &s;ix or &s;even
Pound Weight which we had at &s;everal times gi|ven
our Artificer to make Baubles with; and now
we talk'd of going forward to the Coa&s;t, to put
an End to our Journey; but our Guide laught at
us then: Nay you can't go now, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> for the
rainy Sea&s;on beings next Month, and there will
be no &s;tirring then. This we found indeed rea|&s;onable,
&s;o we re&s;olved to furni&s;h our &s;elves with
Provi&s;ions that we might not be obliged to go
abroad too much in the Rain, and we &s;pread our
&s;elves &s;ome one Way, &s;ome another, as far as
we cared to venture, to get Provi&s;ions, and our
Negroes killed us &s;ome Deer which we cured
as well as we could, in the Sun, for we had now
no Salt.</P>
<P>By this time the rainy Months were &s;et in,
and we could &s;carce, for above two Months,
look out of our Hutts. But that was not all, for
the Rivers were &s;o &s;welled with the Land Floods
that we &s;carce knew the little Brooks and Rivu|lets
from the great navigable Rivers. This had
been a very good Opportunity for to have con|vey'd
by Water, upon Rafts, our Elephants
Teeth, of which we had a very great Pile; for
<PB N="176" REF="178">
as we always gave the Savages &s;ome Reward for
their Labour, the very Women would bring us
Teeth upon every Opportunity, and &s;ometimes a
great Tooth carried between two; &s;o that our
Quantity was encrea&s;ed to about two and twenty
Ton of Teeth.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Weather proved fair again, he
told us he would not pre&s;s us to any further Stay,
&s;ince we did not care whether we got any more
Gold or no; that we were indeed the fir&s;t Men
ever he met with in his Life, that &s;aid they had
Gold enough, and of whom it might be truly &s;aid,
that when it lay under our Feet, we would
not &s;toop to take it up. But &s;ince he had made
us a Promi&s;e, he would not break it, nor pre&s;s
us to make any farther Stay, only he thought
he ought to tell us, that now was the Time,
after the Land Flood, when the greate&s;t Quan|tity
of Gold was found; and that if we &s;tayed
but one Month, we &s;hould &s;ee Thou&s;ands of Sava|ges
&s;pread them&s;elves over the whole Country,
to wa&s;h the Gold out of the Sand, for the <HI>Euro|pean</HI>
Ships who would come on the Coa&s;t; that they
do it then, becau&s;e the Rage of the Floods always
works down a great deal of Gold out of the
Hills; and if we took the Advantage to be there
before them, we did not know what extraordi|nary
things we might find.</P>
<P>This was &s;o forcible, and &s;o well argued, that
it appeared in all our Faces we were prevailed
upon; &s;o we told him we would all &s;tay: For
tho' it was true we were all eager to be gone, yet
the evident Pro&s;pect of &s;o much Advantage,
could not well be re&s;i&s;ted: That he was greatly
mi&s;taken when he &s;ugge&s;ted, that we did not de|&s;ire
to encrea&s;e our Store of Gold, and in that
<PB N="177" REF="179">
we were re&s;olved to make the utmo&s;t U&s;e of the
Advantage that was in our Hands, and would
&s;tay as long as any Gold was to be had, if it was
another Year.</P>
<P>He could hardly expre&s;s the Joy he was in on
this Occa&s;ion, and the fair Weather coming on,
we began ju&s;t as he directed, to &s;earch about
the Rivers for more Gold; at fir&s;t we had but
little Encouragement, and began to be doubtful,
but it was very plain that the Rea&s;on was the
Water was not fully fallen, or the Rivers reduced
to there u&s;ual Channel; but in a few Days we
were fully requited, and found much more Gold
than at fir&s;t, and in bigger Lumps; and one of
our Men wa&s;hed out of the Sand a Piece of Gold
as big as a &s;mall Nut, which weighed, by our E&s;ti|mation,
for we had no &s;mall Weights, almo&s;t an
Ounce and half.</P>
<P>This Succe&s;s made us extreamly diligent, and
in little more than a Month, we had all together
gotten near &s;ixty Pound Weight of Gold;
but after this, as he told us, we found Abun|dance
of the Savages, both Men, Women and
Children, hunting every River and Brook, and
even the dry Land of the Hills for Gold, &s;o that
we could do nothing like then, compared to what
we had done before.</P>
<P>But our Artificer found a Way to make other
People find us in Gold without our own Labour;
for when the&s;e People began to appear, he had a
con&s;iderable Quantity of his Toys, Birds, Bea&s;ts,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch as before, ready for them, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Gentleman being the Interpreter, he brought the
Savages to admire them; &s;o our Cutler had Trade
enough; and to be &s;ure &s;old his Goods at a mon|&s;trous
Rate; for he would get an Ounce of Gold,
<PB N="178" REF="180">
&s;ometimes two, for a Bit of Silver, perhaps of
the Value of a Groat, nay if it were Iron; and if
it was of Gold, they would not give the more
for it; and it was incredible almo&s;t to think
what a Quantity of Gold he got that Way.</P>
<P>In a Word, to bring this happy Journey to a
Conclu&s;ion, we encrea&s;ed our Stock of Gold here
in three Months Stay more, to &s;uch a Degree,
that bringing it all to a common Stock, in order
to Share it, we divided almo&s;t four Pound Weight
again to every Man, and then we &s;et forward
for the Gold Coa&s;t, to &s;ee what Method we
could find out for our Pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There happened &s;everal very remarkable Inci|dents
in this Part of our Journey, as to how we
were, or were not, received friendly, by the &s;everal
Nations of Savages through whom we pa&s;t; how
we delivered one Negroe King from Captivity,
who had been a Benefactor to our new Guide;
and how our Guide in Gratitude, by our A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
re&s;tored him to his Kingdom, which perhaps
might contain about 300 Subjects; how he enter|tained
us; and how he made his Subjects go with
our <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and fetch all our Elephants
Teeth, which we had been obliged to leave be|hind
us, and to carry them for us to the River,
the Name of which I forgot, where we made
Rafts, and in eleven Days more came down to
one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlements on the Gold Coa&s;t,
where we arrived in perfect Health, and to our
great Satisfaction. As for our Cargo of Teeth,
we &s;old it to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory, and received
Clothes and other Nece&s;&s;aries for our &s;elves, and
&s;uch of our Negroes as we thought fit to keep
with us; and it is to be ob&s;erved, that we had
four Pound of Gunpowder left when we ended our
<PB N="179" REF="181">
Journey. The <HI>Negro Prince</HI> we made perfectly
free, clothed him out of our common Stock,
and gave him a Pound and a half of Gold for
him&s;elf, which he knew very well how to mana|ge,
and here we all parted after the mo&s;t friendly
Manner po&s;&s;ible. Our <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> remained in the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Factory &s;ome time, and, as I heard after|wards,
died there of Grief; for he having &s;ent a
Thou&s;and Pound Sterling over to <HI>England</HI> by the
Way of <HI>Holland,</HI> for his Refuge, at his Return
to his Friends, the Ship was taken by the <HI>French,</HI>
and the Effects all lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of my Comrades went away in a
&s;mall Bark, to the two <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Factories, near
<HI>Gambia,</HI> in the Latitude of fourteen; and I with
two Negroes which I kept with me, went away
to <HI>Cape Coa&s;t Ca&s;tle,</HI> where I got Pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and arrived there in <HI>September;</HI> and thus
ended my fir&s;t Harve&s;t of <HI>Wild Oats,</HI> the re&s;t
were not &s;owed to &s;o much Advantage.</P>
<P>I had neither Friend, Relation, nor Acquain|tance
in <HI>England,</HI> tho' it was my Native Coun|try,
I had con&s;equently no Per&s;on to tru&s;t with
what I had, or to coun&s;el me to &s;ecure or &s;ave
it; but falling into ill Company, and tru&s;ting the
Keeper of a Publick Hou&s;e in <HI>Rotherhith</HI> with a
great Part of my Money, and ha&s;tily &s;quander|ing
away the re&s;t, all that great Sum, which I
got with &s;o much Pains and Hazard, was gone
in little more than two Years Time; and as I even
rage in my own Thoughts to reflect upon the
Manner how it was wa&s;ted, &s;o I need record no
more; the re&s;t Merits to be conceal'd with Blu&s;hes,
for that it was &s;pent in all Kinds of Folly and
Wickedne&s;s, &s;o this Scene of my Life may be &s;aid
<PB N="180" REF="182">
to have begun in Theft, and ended in Luxury; a
&s;ad Setting out, and a wor&s;e Coming home.</P>
<P>About the Year I began to &s;ee the Bottom
of my Stock, and that it was Time to think
of farther Adventures, for my Spoilers, as I
call them, began to let me know, that as my
Money declined, their Re&s;pect would ebb with it,
and that I had nothing to expect of them farther
than as I might command it by the Force of my
Money, which in &s;hort would not go an Inch the
farther, for all that had been &s;pent in their Fa|vour
before.</P>
<P>This &s;hocked me very much, and I conceived a
ju&s;t Abhorrence of their Ingratitude; but it
wore off; nor had I with it any Regret at the wa|&s;ting
&s;o glorious a Sum of Money, as I brought
to <HI>England</HI> with me.</P>
<P>I next &s;hipped my &s;elf, in an evil Hour to be
&s;ure, on a Voyage to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> in a Ship called the
and in the Cour&s;e of our Voyage, being
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> was obliged to put in to
the <HI>Groyn,</HI> by a &s;trong South We&s;t Wind.</P>
<P>Here I fell into Company with &s;ome Ma&s;ters
of Mi&s;chief, and among them, one forwarder
than the re&s;t, began an intimate Confidence with
me, &s;o that we called one another Brothers, and
communicated all our Circum&s;tances to one an|other;
his Name was <HI>Harris.</HI> This Fellow came to
me one Morning, asking me if I would go on Shore,
and I agreed; &s;o we got the Captain's Leave
for the Boat, and went together. When we were
together, he asked me if I had a Mind for an Ad|venture
that might make amends for all pa&s;t
Misfortunes; I told him yes, with all my Heart;
for I did not care where I went, having nothing
to lo&s;e, and no Body to leave behind me.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="183">
He then asked me if I would &s;wear to be &s;e|cret,
and that if I did not agree to what he pro|po&s;ed,
I would neverthele&s;s never betray him;
I readily bound my &s;elf to that, upon the mo&s;t
&s;olemn Imprecations and Cur&s;es that the Devil
and both of us could invent.</P>
<P>He told me then, there was a brave Fellow in
the other Ship, pointing to another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Ship which rode in the Harbour, who in Con|cert
with &s;ome of the Men had re&s;olved to muti|ny
the next Morning, and run away with the
Ship; and that if we could get Strength enough
among our Ship's Company we might do the &s;ame.
I liked the Propo&s;al very well, and he got eight
of us to join with him, and he told us, that as
&s;oon as his Friend had begun the Work, and was
Ma&s;ter of the Ship, we &s;hould be ready to do
the like; this was his Plot, and I without the
lea&s;t He&s;itation, either at the Villainy of the Fact,
or the Difficulty of performing it, came imme|diately
into the wicked Con&s;piracy, and &s;o it
went on among us; but we could not bring our
Part to Perfection.</P>
<P>Accordingly on the Day appointed, his Cor|re&s;pondent
in the other Ship, who&s;e Name was
<HI>Wilmot,</HI> began the Work, and having &s;eized the
Captain's Mate, and other Officers, &s;ecured the
Ship, and gave the Signal to us; we were but
eleven in our Ship, who were in the Con&s;piracy,
nor could we get any more that we could tru&s;t,
&s;o that leaving the Ship, we all took the Boat
and went off to join the other.</P>
<P>Having thus left the Ship I was in, we were
entertained with a great deal of Joy by Captain
<HI>Wilmot</HI> and his new Gang; and being well pre|pared
for all manner of Roguery, bold, de&s;pe|rate,
<PB N="182" REF="184">
I mean my &s;elf, without the lea&s;t Checks
of Con&s;cience, for what I was entred upon, or
for any Thing I might do, much le&s;s with any
Apprehen&s;ion of what might be the Con&s;e|quence
of it; I &s;ay, having thus embarked with
this Crew, which at la&s;t brought me to con&s;ort
with the mo&s;t famous Pyrates of the Age, &s;ome of
whom have ended their Journals at the Gallows:
I think the giving an Account of &s;ome of my
other Adventures may be an agreeable Piece
of Story; and this I may venture to &s;ay before
Hand, upon the Word of a PYRATE, that I
&s;hall not be able to recollect the full, no not by
far, of the great Variety which has formed one
of the mo&s;t reprobate Schemes that ever Man was
capable to pre&s;ent to the World.</P>
<P>I that was, as I have hinted before, an original
Thief, and a Pyrate even by Inclination before,
was now in my Element, and never undertook
any Thing in my Life with more particular Sa|tisfaction.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> for &s;o we are now to call him,
being thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Ship, and in the Manner
as you have heard, it may be ea&s;ily concluded
he had nothing to do to &s;tay in the Port, or to
wait either the Attempts which might be made
from the Shore, or any Change which might
happen among his Men. On the Contrary, we
weighed Anchor the &s;ame Tide, and &s;tood out to
Sea, &s;teering away for the <HI>Canaries.</HI> Our Ship
had Twenty Two Guns, but was able to carry
Thirty; and be&s;ides, as &s;he was fitted out for a
Merchant Ship only, &s;he was not furni&s;hed either
with Ammunition or &s;mall Arms &s;ufficient for
our De&s;ign, or for the Occa&s;ion we might have
in Ca&s;e of a Fight; &s;o we put into <HI>Cadiz,</HI> that is
<PB N="183" REF="185">
to &s;ay, we came to an Anchor in the Bay; and the
Captain and one whom we call'd young Captain
<HI>Kid,</HI> who was the Gunner, and &s;ome of the Men
who could be&s;t be tru&s;ted, among whom was my
Comrade <HI>Harris,</HI> who was made &s;econd Mate,
and my &s;elf who was made a Lieutenant; &s;ome
Bales of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods were propo&s;ed to be car|ried
on Shore with us for Sale; but my Comrade,
who was a compleat Fellow at his Bu&s;ine&s;s, pro|po&s;ed
a better Way for it; and having been in
the Town before, told us in &s;hort, that he would
buy what Powder and Bullet, &s;mall Arms, or
any thing el&s;e we wanted, on his own Word, to
be paid for when they came on Board, in &s;uch
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods as we had there. This was by much
the be&s;t Way, and accordingly he and the Cap|tain
went on Shore by them&s;elves, and having made
&s;uch a Bargain as they found for their Turn, came
away again in two Hours time, and bringing on|ly
a Butt of Wine, and five Casks of Brandy with
them, we all went on Board again.</P>
<P>The next Morning two Barco Longo's came
off to us deep loaden, with five <HI>Spaniards</HI> on board
them, for Traffick. Our Captain &s;old them good.
Penny worths, and they delivered us &s;ixteen Bar|rels
of Powder, twelve &s;mall Runlets of fine Pow|der
for our &s;mall Arms, &s;ixty Mu&s;quets, and
twelve Fuzees for the Officers; &s;eventeen Ton of
Cannon Ball, fifteen Barrels of Mu&s;quetBullets,
with &s;ome Swords, and twenty good Pair of Pi|&s;tols.
Be&s;ides this, they brought thirteen Butts
of Wine (for we that were now all become Gen|tlemen
&s;corn'd to drink the Ship's Beer) al&s;o &s;ix|teen
Puncheons of Brandy, with twelve Barrels
of Rai&s;ins, and twenty Che&s;ts of Lemons: All
which were paid for in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods; and over
<PB N="184" REF="186">
and above, the Captain received 600 Pieces of
Eight in Money. They would have come again,
but we would &s;tay no longer.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;ailed to the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and from
thence onward to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> where we com|mitted
&s;ome Depredation upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for
Provi&s;ion, and took &s;ome Prizes, but none of
any great Value, while I remained with them,
which was not long at that Time; for having
taken a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sloop on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cartagena,</HI>
my Friend made a Motion to me, that we &s;hould
de&s;ire Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> to put us into the Sloop,
with a Proportion of Arms and Ammunition,
and let us try what we could do; &s;he being much
fitter for our Bu&s;ine&s;s than the great Ship, and a
better Sailer. This he con&s;ented to, and we ap|pointed
our Rendezvous at <HI>Tobago,</HI> making an
Agreement, that whatever was taken by either of
our Ships, &s;hould be &s;hared among the Ship's
Company of both; all which we very punctually
ob&s;erved, and join'd our Ships again about fifteen
Months after, at the I&s;land of <HI>Tobago,</HI> as above.</P>
<P>We crui&s;ed near two Years in tho&s;e Seas, chief|ly
upon the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> not that we made any Dif|ficulty
of taking <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, or <HI>Dutch,</HI> or <HI>French,</HI>
if they came in our Way; and particularly Cap|tain
<HI>Wilmot</HI> attack'd a <HI>New-England</HI> Ship bound
from the <HI>Maderas</HI> to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> and another bound
from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Berbadoes,</HI> with Provi&s;ions;
which la&s;t was a very happy Supply to us. But
the Rea&s;on why we meddled as little with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Ve&s;&s;els as we could, was, fir&s;t, becau&s;e, if they
were Ships of any Force, we were &s;ure of more
Re&s;i&s;tance from them; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e we
found the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships had le&s;s Booty when taken;
for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> generally had Money on board,
<PB N="185" REF="187">
and that was what we be&s;t knew what to do with.
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> was indeed more particularly
cruel when he took any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, that they
might not too &s;oon have Advice of him in <HI>England,</HI>
and &s;o the Men of War have Orders to look out
for him. But this Part I bury in Silence for the
pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We encrea&s;ed our Stock in the&s;e two Years
con&s;iderably, having taken 60000 Pieces of Eight
in one Ve&s;&s;el, and 100000 in another; and being
thus fir&s;t grown rich, we re&s;olved to be &s;trong
too; for we had taken a Brigantine built at <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI>
an excellent Sea Boat, and a good Sailer, and
able to carry twelve Guns; and a large <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Frigat-built Ship, that &s;ailed incomparably well
al&s;o, and which afterwards, by the Help of good
Carpenters, we fitted up to carry twenty eight
Guns. And now we wanted more Hands, &s;o we
put away for the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> not doubting
we &s;hould &s;hip as many Men there as we plea|&s;ed,
and &s;o we did.</P>
<P>Here we &s;old the Sloop that I was in; and
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> keeping his own Ship, I took the
Command of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Frigat, as Captain, and
my Comrade <HI>Harris</HI> as elde&s;t Lieutenant, and a
bold enterprizing Fellow he was as any the World
afforded. One <HI>Culverdine</HI> was put into the Brigan|tine,
&s;o that we were now three &s;tout Ships, well
Mann'd, and Victualled for twelve Months; for
we had taken two or three Sloops from <HI>New-Eng|land</HI>
and <HI>New-York,</HI> loaden with Flour, Pea&s;e,
and Barrell'd Beef, and Pork, going for <HI>Jamaica</HI>
and <HI>Berbadoes;</HI> and for more Beef we went on
Shore on the I&s;le of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where we killed as many
black Cattel as we plea&s;ed, tho' we had very little
Salt to cure them.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188">
Out of all the Prizes we took here, we took
their Powder and Bullet, their &s;mall Arms and
Cutla&s;&s;es; and as for their Men, we always took
the Surgeon and the Carpenter, as Per&s;ons who
were of particular U&s;e to us upon many Occa&s;i|ons;
nor were they always unwilling to go with
us, tho' for their own Security, in Ca&s;e of Acci|dents,
they might ea&s;ily pretend they were car|ried
away by Force, of which I &s;hall give a plea|&s;ant
Account in the Cour&s;e of my other Expe|ditions.</P>
<P>We had one very merry Fellow here, a Qua|ker,
who&s;e Name was <HI>William Walters,</HI> whom we
took out of a Sloop bound from <HI>Pen&s;ilvania</HI> to
<HI>Berbadoes.</HI> He was a Surgeon, and they called
him Doctor; but he was not employed in the
Sloop as a Surgeon, but was going to <HI>Berbadoes</HI>
to get a <HI>Birth,</HI> as the Sailors call it. However,
he had all his Surgeon's Che&s;t on board, and we
made him go with us, and take all his Implements
with him. He was a comick Fellow indeed, a
Man of very good &s;olid Sen&s;e, and an excellent
Surgeon; but what was worth all, very good hu|mour'd
and plea&s;ant in his Conver&s;ation, and a
bold, &s;tout, brave Fellow too, as any we had
among us.</P>
<P>I found <HI>William,</HI> as I thought, not very aver&s;e
to go along with us, and yet re&s;olved to do it
&s;o, that it might be apparent he was taken away
by Force; and to this Purpo&s;e he comes to me,
Friend, &s;ays he, thou &s;aye&s;t I mu&s;t go with thee,
and it is not in my Power to re&s;i&s;t thee, if I
would; but I de&s;ire thou wilt oblige the Ma&s;ter
of the Sloop which I am on board, to certify un|der
his Hand that I was taken away by Force,
and again&s;t my Will; and this he &s;aid with &s;o
<PB N="187" REF="189">
much Satisfaction in his Face, that I could not
but under&s;tand him. Ay, ay, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> whether
it be again&s;t your Will, or no, I'll make him and
all the Men give you a Certificate of it, or I'll take
them all along with us, and keep them till they
do: So I drew up the Certificate my &s;elf, where|in
I wrote that he was taken away by main Force,
as a Pri&s;oner, by a Pyrate Ship; that they carried
away his Che&s;t and In&s;truments fir&s;t, and then
bound his Hands behind him, and forced him
into their Boat; and this was &s;igned by the Ma|&s;ter
and all his Men.</P>
<P>Accordingly I fell a &s;wearing at him, and cal|led
to my Men to tye his Hands behind him, and
&s;o we put him into our Boat, and carry'd him
away. When I had him on board, I called him
to me: Now, Friend, &s;ays I, I have brought you
away by Force, it is true, but I am not of the
Opinion I have brought you away &s;o much again&s;t
your Will as they imagine: Come, &s;ays I, you
will be a u&s;eful Man to us, and you &s;hall have ve|ry
good U&s;age among us; &s;o I unbound his Hands,
and fir&s;t ordered all things that belonged to him
to be re&s;tored to him, and our Captain gave
him a Dram.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t dealt friendly by me, &s;ays he, and
I'll be plain with thee, whether I came willingly
to thee, or not: I &s;hall make my &s;elf as u&s;eful
to thee as I can; but thou knowe&s;t it is not
my Bu&s;ine&s;s to meddle when thou art to fight.
No, no, &s;ays the Captain, but you may meddle a
little when we &s;hare the Money. Tho&s;e things
are u&s;eful to furni&s;h a Surgeon's Che&s;t, &s;ays
<HI>William,</HI> and &s;miled; but I &s;hall be moderate.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>William</HI> was a mo&s;t agreeable Compa|nion,
but he had the better of us in this Part,
<PB N="188" REF="190">
that, if we were taken, we were &s;ure to be
hang'd, and he was &s;ure to e&s;cape; and he knew
it well enough: But in &s;hort he was a &s;prightly
Fellow, and fitter to be Captain than any of
us. I &s;hall have often an Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of
him in the re&s;t of the Story.</P>
<P>Our Crui&s;ing &s;o long in the&s;e Seas began now
to be &s;o well known, that not in <HI>England</HI> only,
but in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Accounts had been made
publick of our Adventures, and many Stories told
how we murthered the People in cold Blood,
tying them Back to Back, and throwing them in|to
the Sea; one Half of which however was not
true, tho' more was done than it is fit to &s;peak
of here.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of this however was, that
&s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War were &s;ent to the
<HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and were particularly in&s;tructed to
cruize in the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and the Gulph of
<HI>Florida,</HI> and among the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands, if po&s;&s;i|ble,
to attack us.</P>
<P>We were not &s;o ignorant of things, as not to
expect this, after &s;o long a Stay in that Part of
the World; but the fir&s;t certain Account we had
of them, was at the <HI>Honduras,</HI> when a Ve&s;&s;el co|ming
in from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> told us, that two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Men of War were coming directly from <HI>Jamaica</HI>
thither, in Que&s;t of us. We were indeed as it were
embay'd, and could not have made the lea&s;t Shift
to have got off, if they had come directly to us;
but as it happen'd, &s;ome body had informed them
that we were in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and they
went directly thither, by which we were not
only free of them, but were &s;o much to the
Windward of them, that they could not make
<PB N="189" REF="191">
any Attempt upon us, tho' they had known we
were there.</P>
<P>We took this Advantage, and &s;tood away for
<HI>Carthagena,</HI> and from thence with great Difficulty
beat it up at a Di&s;tance from under the Shore for
St. <HI>Martha,</HI> tillwe came to the <HI>Dutch</HI> I&s;land of <HI>Cura&s;oe,</HI>
and from thence to the I&s;land of <HI>Tobago;</HI> which, as
before, was our Rendezvous; which being a de&s;er|ted
uninhabited I&s;land, we at the &s;ame time made
u&s;e of for a Retreat: Here the Captain of the <HI>Bri|gantine</HI>
died, and Captain <HI>Harris</HI> at that time my
Lieutenant, took the Command of the <HI>Bri|gantine.</HI></P>
<P>Here we came to a Re&s;olution, to go away to
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and from thence to the Cape
of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> and &s;o for the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies:</HI> But
Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> as I have &s;aid, being now Cap|tain
of the <HI>Brigantine,</HI> alledged that his Ship
was too &s;mall for &s;o long a Voyage; but that if
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> would con&s;ent, he would take
the Hazard of another Cruize, and he would fol|low
us in the fir&s;t Ship he could take: So we
appointed our Rendezvous to be at <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI>
which was done by my Recommendation of the
Place, and the Plenty of Provi&s;ions to be had
there.</P>
<P>Accordingly he went away from us <HI>in an evil
Hour,</HI> for in&s;tead of taking a Ship to follow us,
he was taken, as I heard afterwards, by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Man of War, and being laid in Irons, died of
meer Grief and Anger before he came to <HI>England:</HI>
His Lieutenant, I have heard, was afterwards exe|cuted
in <HI>England</HI> for a Pyrate, and this was the
End of the Man who fir&s;t brought me into this
unhappy Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">
We parted from <HI>Tobago</HI> three Days after, bend|ing
our Cour&s;e for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> but had
not been at Sea above Twenty Four Hours,
when we were &s;eparated by a terrible Storm,
which held three Days, with very little Abate|ment
or Intermi&s;&s;ion. In this Juncture, Captain
<HI>Wilmot</HI> happen'd unluckily to be on board my
Ship, very much to his Mortification; for we
not only lo&s;t Sight of his Ship, but never &s;aw
her more, till we came to <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> where
&s;he was ca&s;t away. In &s;hort, after having in this
Tempe&s;t lo&s;t our Fore-Top Ma&s;t, we were forced
to put back to the I&s;le of <HI>Tobago</HI> for Shelter,
and to repair our Damage, which brought us all
very near our De&s;truction.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner on Shore here, and all very
bu&s;y looking out for a Piece of Timber for a
Top-Ma&s;t, but we perceived &s;tanding in for the
Shore, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War of Thirty &s;ix
Guns: It was a great Surprize to us indeed, becau&s;e
we were di&s;abled &s;o much, but to our great good
Fortune we lay pretty &s;nug and clo&s;e among the
high Rocks, and the Man of War did not &s;ee us,
but &s;tood off again upon his Crui&s;e; &s;o we only
ob&s;erved which Way &s;he went, and at Night
leaving our Work, re&s;olved to &s;tand off to Sea,
&s;teering contrary Way from that which we
ob&s;erved &s;he went. And this we found had
the de&s;ired Succe&s;s, for we &s;aw him no more:
We had gotten an old Mizen Top-Ma&s;t on board,
which made us a Jury Fore-Top-Ma&s;t for the
pre&s;ent, and &s;o we &s;tood away for the I&s;le <HI>Tri|nidad,</HI>
where, though there were <HI>Spaniards</HI> on
Shore, yet we landed &s;ome Men with our Boat,
and cut a very good Piece of Fi$ to make us a
<PB N="191" REF="193">
new Top-Ma&s;t, which we got &s;itted up effectually,
and al&s;o we got &s;ome Cattle here to eke out our
Provi&s;ions, and calling a Council of War among
our &s;elves, we re&s;olved to quit tho&s;e Seas for the
pre&s;ent, and &s;teer away for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing we attempted here, was only
getting fre&s;h Water; but we learnt, that there
lay the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Fleet at the Bay of <HI>All-Saints,</HI>
bound for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> ready to &s;ail, and only waited
for a fair Wind; this made us lye by, wi&s;hing to
&s;ee them put to Sea, and accordingly as they
were, with, or without Convoy, to attack or avoid
them.</P>
<P>It &s;prung up a fre&s;h Gale in the Evening, at
S. W. by W. which being fair for the <HI>Portugal</HI> Fleet,
and the Weather plea&s;ant and agreeable, we
heard the Signal given to unmore, and running
in under the I&s;land of <HI>Si</HI>&mdash;we hauled our
Main-Sail and Fore-Sail up in the Brails, lower'd
the Top-Sail upon the Cap, and clewed them up
that we might lye as &s;nug as we could, expect|ing
their coming out; and the next Morning
&s;aw the whole Fleet come out accordingly, but
not at all to our Satisfaction, for they con&s;i&s;ted of
Twenty &s;ix Sail, and mo&s;t of them Ships of Force,
as well as Burthen, both Merchant Men and Men
of War; &s;o &s;eeing there was no meddling, we lay
&s;till where we was al&s;o, till the Fleet was out of
Sight, and then &s;tood off and on, in hopes of meet|ing
with further Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>It was not long before we &s;aw a Sail, and im|mediately
gave her Cha&s;e, but &s;he proved an ex|cellent
Sailer, and &s;tanding out to Sea, we &s;aw
plainly &s;he tru&s;ted to her Heels, that is to &s;ay, to
her Sails; however, as we were a clean Ship we
gained upon her, tho' &s;lowly, and had we had a
<PB N="192" REF="194">
Day before us, we &s;hould certainly have come
up with her, but it grew dark apace, and in that
Ca&s;e we knew we &s;hould lo&s;e Sight of her.</P>
<P>Our merry Quaker perceiving us to crowd
&s;till after her in the Dark, wherein we could
not &s;ee which way &s;he went, come very drily to
me; <HI>Friend</HI> Singleton, &s;ays he, <HI>doe&s;t thee know what
we are a doing?</HI> Says I, <HI>yes, why we are cha&s;ing yon
Ship, are we not? And how do&s;t thou know that,</HI> &s;ays
he very gravely &s;till? <HI>Nay, that is true,</HI> &s;ays I
again, <HI>we cannot he &s;ure. Yes Friend,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I
think we may be &s;ure that we are running away from
her, not cha&s;ing her. I am afraid,</HI> adds he, <HI>thou art
turned Quaker, and ha&s;t re&s;olved not to u&s;e the Hand
of Power, or art a Coward, and art flying from thy
Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>What do you mean, <HI>&s;ays I, I think I &s;wore at him;</HI>
what do ye &s;neer at now? you have always one dry Rub or
another to give us.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it's plain enough, the Ship &s;tood off
to Sea, due Ea&s;t on purpo&s;e to lo&s;e us, and thou may'&s;t
be &s;ure her Bu&s;ine&s;s does not lie that Way; for what
&s;hould &s;he do at the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> in this Latitude,
which would be as far South as <HI>Congo</HI> or <HI>Angola;</HI> but
as &s;oon as it is dark, that we &s;hall lo&s;e Sight of her, &s;he
will tack and &s;tand away We&s;t again for the <HI>Bra&s;il</HI>
Coa&s;t, and for the Bay, where thou knowe&s;t &s;he was going
before; and are not we then a running away from her?
<HI>I am greately in hopes, Friend,</HI> &s;ays the dry gibing
Creature, <HI>Thou wilt turn Quaker, for I &s;ee thou
art not for Fighting.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Very well</HI> WILLIAM, &s;ays I, <HI>then I &s;hall make an
excellent Pyrate.</HI> However, <HI>William</HI> was in the right,
and I apprehended what he meant immediately,
and Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who lay very &s;ick in his Ca|bin,
overhearing us, under&s;tood him as well as
<PB N="193" REF="195">
I, and called out to me, that <HI>William</HI> was right
and it was our be&s;t Way to change our Cour&s;e,
and &s;tand away for the Bay, where it was Ten
to one but we &s;hould &s;nap her in the Morning.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we went about &s;nip, got our
Larboard Tacks on board, &s;et the Top-gallant
Sails, and crowded for the Bay of <HI>All-Saints,</HI>
where we came to an Anchor, early in the Morn|ing
ju&s;t out of Gun Shot of the Forts; we furl'd
our Sails with Rope-Yarns, that we might haul
home the Sheets without going up to loo&s;e them,
and lowering our Main and Fore-Yards, looked
ju&s;t as if we had lain there a good while.</P>
<P>In two Hours after, we &s;aw our Game, &s;tand|ing
in for the Bay with all the Sail &s;he could make,
and &s;he came innocently into our very Mouths,
for we lay &s;till, till we &s;aw her almo&s;t within
Gun Shot; when our Fore Ma&s;t Geers being
&s;tretched fore and aft, we fir&s;t run up our Yards,
and then hauled home the Top-Sail Sheets; the
Rope-Yarns that furled them giving Way of
them&s;elves, the Sails were &s;et in a few Minutes;
at the &s;ame time &s;lipping our Cable, we came
upon her before &s;he could get under Way upon
'tother Tack: They were &s;o &s;urprized, that they
made little or no Re&s;i&s;tance, but &s;truck after the
fir&s;t Broad-Side.</P>
<P><HI>We were con&s;idering what to do with her,
when</HI> William <HI>came to me.</HI> Hark thee Friend, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> thou ha&s;t made a fine Spot of Work of it now, ha&s;t
thou not? To horrow thy Neighbour's Ship here, ju&s;t at
thy Neighbour's Door, and never ask him Leave; now
do&s;t thou not think there are &s;ome Men of War in the
Port, thou ha&s;t given them the Alarm &s;ufficiently;
thou will have them upon thy Back before Night, depend
upon it, to ask thee, wherefore, Thou di&s;t &s;o?</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196">
Truly <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> for ought I know, that may
be true: What then &s;hall we do next? <HI>Says he,</HI> thou ha&s;t
but two Things to do, either go in and take all the re&s;t, or
el&s;e get thee gone before they come out, and take thee; for
I &s;ee they are hoi&s;ting a Top-Ma&s;t to you great Ship, in
order to put to Sea immediately, and they won't be long
before they come to talk with thee; and what wilt thou
&s;ay to them, when they ask thee why thou borrowed&s;t their
Ship without Leave?</P>
<P>As <HI>William</HI> &s;aid, &s;o it was, we could &s;ee by our
Gla&s;&s;es that they were all in a Hurry, manning
and fitting &s;ome Sloops they had there, and a large
Man of War, and it was plain they would &s;oon
be with us; but we were not at a Lo&s;s what to
do; we found the Ship we had taken was loaden
with nothing con&s;iderable for our Purpo&s;e, except
&s;ome Cocoa, &s;ome Sugar, and Twenty Barrels of
Flower; the re&s;t of her Loading was Hides; &s;o
we took out all we thought for our Turn, and
among the re&s;t all her Ammunition, great Shot,
and &s;mall Arms, and turned her off; we al&s;o
took a Cable and three Anchors &s;he had, which
were for our Purpo&s;e, and &s;ome of her Sails;
&s;he had enough left ju&s;t to carry her into Port,
and that was all.</P>
<P>Having done this, we &s;tood on upon the <HI>Bra&s;il</HI>
Coa&s;t, Southward, till we came to the Mouth of
the River <HI>Janiero:</HI> But as we had two Days the
Wind blowing hard at S. E. and S. S. E. we
were obliged to come to an Anchor under a little
I&s;land, and wait for a Wind. In this time the
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> had it &s;eems given Notice over Land to
the Governour there, that a Pyrate was upon
the Coa&s;t; &s;o that when we came in View of the
Port, we &s;aw two Men of War riding ju&s;t
without the Bar, whereof one we found was
<PB N="195" REF="197">
getting under Sail with all po&s;&s;ible Speed, having
&s;lipt her Cable, on purpo&s;e to &s;peak with us;
the other was not &s;o forward, but was preparing
to follow: In le&s;s than an Hour they &s;tood both
fair after us, with all the Sail they could make.</P>
<P>Had not the Night come on, <HI>William</HI>'s Words
had been made good; they would certainly
have asked us the Que&s;tion what we did there?
for we found the foremo&s;t Ship gained upon us,
e&s;pecially upon one Tack; for we plied away
from them to Windward, but in the Dark lo&s;ing
Sight of them, we re&s;olved to change our Cour&s;e,
and &s;tand away directly to Sea, not doubting but
we &s;hould lo&s;e them in the Night.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Commander gue&s;&s;ed
we would do &s;o or no, I know not; but in the
Morning when the Day-light appeared, in&s;tead
of having lo&s;t him, we found him in Cha&s;e of us,
about a League a-Stern; only to our great good
Fortune we could &s;ee but one of the two; how|ever
this one was a great Ship, carried &s;ix and
forty Guns, and an admirable Sailer, as appeared
by her out-&s;ailing us; for our Ship was an excel|lent
Sailer too, as I have &s;aid before.</P>
<P>When I found this, I ea&s;ily &s;aw there was no
Remedy, but we mu&s;t engage; and as we knew
we could expect no Quarters from tho&s;e Scoun|drels
the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> a Nation I had an original
Aver&s;ion to, I let Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> know how
it was. The Captain, &s;ick as he was, jumped
up in the Cabin, and would be led out upon the
Deck, for he was very weak, to &s;ee how it was;
well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we'll fight them.</P>
<P>Our Men were all in good heart before, but to
&s;ee the Captain &s;o brisk who had lain ill of a Ca|lenture
Ten or Eleven Days, gave them double
<PB N="196" REF="198">
Courage, and they went all Hands to work to
make a clear Ship and be ready. <HI>William</HI> the
Quaker comes to me with a kind of a Smile;
Friend, &s;ays he, what does yo$ Ship follow us
for? Why &s;ays I, to fight us you may be &s;ure;
Well, &s;ays he, and will he come up with us do&s;t
thou think? Yes, &s;aid I, you &s;ee &s;he will. Why
then, Friend, &s;ays the dry Wretch, why do&s;t thou
run from her &s;till, when thou &s;ee&s;t &s;he will over|take
thee? Will it be better for us to be over|taken
further off than here? Much at one for
that, &s;ays I; why what would you have us do?
Do! &s;ays he, let us not give the poor Man more
Trouble than needs mu&s;t; let us &s;tay for him, and
hear what he has to &s;ay to us; he will talk to us
in Powder and Ball &s;aid I: Very well then, &s;ays he
if that be his Country Language, we mu&s;t talk
to him in the &s;ame, mu&s;t we not? Or el&s;e how
&s;hall he under&s;tand us? Very well <HI>William,</HI> &s;ays
I, we under&s;tand you; and the Captain as ill as
he was, called to me, <HI>William</HI>'s right again, &s;ays he,
as good here as a League further; &s;o he gives
a Word of Command, <HI>Haul up the Main-Sail,</HI> we'll
&s;horten Sail for him.</P>
<P>Accordingly we &s;hortened Sail; and as we
expected her upon our Lee Side, we being then
upon our Starboard Tack, brought 18 of our Guns
to the Larboard Side, re&s;olving to give him a
Broad-Side that &s;hould warm him; it was about
half an Hour before he came up with us, all which
time we luffed up, that we might keep the
Wind of him, by which he was obliged to run up
under our Lee, as we de&s;igned him; when we
got him upon our Quarter we edg'd down, and
received the Fire of five or &s;ix of his Guns; by
this time you may be &s;ure all our Hands were at
<PB N="197" REF="199">
their Quarters, &s;o we clapt our Helm hard <HI>a
Weather,</HI> let go the Lee Braces of the Main Top|&s;ail,
and laid it a-back, and &s;o our Ship fell athwart
the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship's Haw&s;e; then we immediately
poured in our Broad-Side, raking them fore and
aft, and killed them a great many Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> we could &s;ee were in the ut|mo&s;t
Confu&s;ion; and not being aware of our De|&s;ign,
their Ship having fre&s;h Way, run their
Bolt&s;prit into the fore Part of our main Shrouds,
as that they could not ea&s;ily get clear of us, and &s;o
we lay locked after that Manner, the Enemy could
not bring above five or &s;ix Guns, be&s;ides their
Small-Arms, to bear upon us, while we played
our whole Broad&s;ide upon him.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Heat of this Fight, as I
was very bu&s;y upon the Quarter Deck, the Cap|tain
calls to me, for he never &s;tirred from us,
what the Devil is Friend <HI>William</HI> a-doing yonder,
&s;ays the Captain, has he any Bu&s;ine&s;s upon Deck?
I &s;tept forward, and there was Friend <HI>William</HI> with
two or three &s;tout Fellows la&s;hing the Ships Bolt|&s;prit
fa&s;t to our Main-Ma&s;t, for fear they &s;hould get
away from us; and every now and then he pulled a
Bottle out of his Pocket and gave the Men a Dram to
encourage them. The Shot flew about his Ears as
thick as may be &s;uppo&s;ed in &s;uch an Action, where
the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> to give them their due, fought very
briskly, believing at fir&s;t they were &s;ure of their
Game, and tru&s;ting to their Superiority; but there
was <HI>William,</HI> as compo&s;ed, and in as perfect Tran|quillity
as to Danger, as if he had been over a
Bowl of Punch, only very bu&s;y &s;ecuring the Mat|ter,
that a Ship of Fourty &s;ix Guns &s;hould not run
away from a Ship of Eight and Twenty.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="200">
This Work was too hot to hold long; our Men
behaved bravely; our Gunner, a gallant Man,
&s;houted below, pouring in his Shot at &s;uch a
Rate, that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> began to &s;lacken their
Fire; we had di&s;mounted &s;everal of their Guns
by firing in at their Foreca&s;tle, and raking them,
as I &s;aid, fore and aft; and pre&s;ently comes <HI>William</HI>
up to me; <HI>Friend</HI> &s;ays he, very calmly, <HI>What
doe&s;t thou mean? Why do&s;t thou not vi&s;it thy Neighbour
in the Ship, the Door being open for thee?</HI> I under&s;tood
him immediately, for our Guns had &s;o tore their
Hull, that we had beat two Port Holes into one,
and the Bulk Head of their Steerage was &s;plit
to Pieces, that they could not retire to their clo&s;e
Quarters; &s;o I gave the Word immediately to
board them. Our Second Lieutenant, with about
Thirty Men, entered in an In&s;tant over the Fore|ca&s;tle,
followed by &s;ome more, with the Boat|&s;wain,
and cutting in Pieces about Twenty five
Men that they found upon the Deck, and then
throwing &s;ome Grenadoes into the Steerage, they
entered there al&s;o; upon which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
cried Quarter pre&s;ently, and we ma&s;tered the
Ship, contrary indeed to our own Expectation;
for we would have compounded with them, if
if they would have &s;heered off, but laying them
athwart the Haw&s;e at fir&s;t, and following our
Fire furiou&s;ly, without giving them any time to
get clear of us, and work their Ship, by this
means, tho' they had &s;ix and forty Guns, they
were not able to Fight above five or &s;ix, as I &s;aid
above, for we beat them immediately from their
Guns in the Foreca&s;tle, and killed them Abun|dance
of Men between Decks, &s;o that when we
entered they had hardly &s;ound Men enough to
fight us Hand to Hand upon their Deck.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201">
The Surprize of Joy, to hear the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
cry Quarter, and &s;ee their Antient &s;truck, was
&s;o great to our Captain, who as I have &s;aid, was
reduced very weak with a high Fever, that it
gave him new Life; Nature conquered the Di|&s;temper,
and the Fever abated that very Night:
So that in two or three Days he was &s;en&s;ibly bet|ter,
his Strength began to come, and he was able
to give his Orders effectually in every thing that
was material, and in about ten Days was entirely
well, and about the Ship.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI>
Man of War, and Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> made me,
or rather I made my &s;elf, Captain of her for the
pre&s;ent; about Thirty of their Seamen took Ser|vice
with us, &s;ome of which were <HI>French,</HI> &s;ome
<HI>Genoe&s;es,</HI> and we &s;et the re&s;t on Shore the next
Day, on a little I&s;land on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> ex|cept
&s;ome wounded Men who were not in a Con|dition
to be removed; and whom we were bound to
keep on board, but we had an Occa&s;ion afterwards
to di&s;po&s;e of them at the Cape, where at their
own Reque&s;t we &s;et them on Shore.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> as &s;oon as the Ship was taken,
and the Pri&s;oners &s;towed, was for &s;tanding in
for the River <HI>Janiero</HI> again, not doubting but we
&s;hould meet with the other Man of War, who
not having been able to find us, and having lo&s;t
the Company of her Comrade, would certainly
be returned, and might be &s;urprized by the Ship
we had taken, if we carryed <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Colours,
and our Men were all for it.</P>
<P>But our Friend <HI>William</HI> gave us better Coun&s;el;
for he came to me, Friend, &s;ays he, I under&s;tand
the Captain is for &s;ailing back to the <HI>Rio Janiero,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="202">
in Hopes to meet with the other Ship that was
in Cha&s;e of thee ye&s;terday; is it true, do&s;t thou
intend it? Why, yes, &s;ays I, <HI>William,</HI> pray why
not? Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> thou may&s;t do &s;o if thou
wilt. Well, I know that too, <HI>William,</HI> &s;aid I;
but the Captain is a Man will be ruled by Rea|&s;on;
what have you to &s;ay to it? Why, &s;ays
<HI>William</HI> gravely, I only ask what is thy Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of all the People thou ha&s;t with
thee? Is it not to get Money? Yes, <HI>William,</HI> it is
&s;o, in our hone&s;t Way: And would&s;t thou, &s;ays
he, rather have Money without Fighting, or
Fighting without Money? I mean, which would&s;t
thou have by Choice, &s;uppo&s;e it to be left to
thee? <HI>O William, &s;ays I,</HI> the fir&s;t of the two, to
be &s;ure. Why then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> what great Gain
ha&s;t thou made of the Prize thou ha&s;t taken now,
tho' it has co&s;t the Lives of thirteen of thy
Men, be&s;ides &s;ome hurt? It is true, thou ha&s;t
got the Ship and &s;ome Pri&s;oners, but thou would&s;t
have had twice the Booty in a Merchant Ship,
with not one Quarter of the Fighting; and how
do&s;t thou know either what Force, or what Num|ber
of Men may be in the other Ship, and what
Lo&s;s thou may&s;t &s;uffer, and what Gain it &s;hall be
to thee, if thou take her? I think indeed thou
may&s;t much better let her alone.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>William,</HI> it is true &s;aid I, and I'll go tell
the Captain what your Opinion is, and bring
you Word what he &s;ays. Accordingly I went
to the Captain, and told him <HI>William</HI>'s Rea&s;ons,
and the Captain was of his Mind, that our Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
was indeed Fighting when we could not help
it, but that our main Affair was Money, and
that with as few Blows as we could; &s;o that Ad|venture
was laid a&s;ide, and we &s;tood along Shore
<PB N="201" REF="203">
again South, for the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> expecting
&s;ome Purcha&s;e thereabouts; e&s;pecially we had
our Eyes upon &s;ome of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships from the
<HI>Bruenos Ayres,</HI> which are generally very rich in
Silver, and one &s;uch Prize would have done our
Bu&s;ine&s;s. We ply'd about here in the Latitude
of South for near a Month, and no|thing
offer'd; and here we began to con&s;ult what
we &s;hould do next, for we had come to no Re&s;o|lution
yet. Indeed my De&s;ign was always for the
<HI>Cape de Bona Speranza,</HI> and &s;o to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI>
I had heard &s;ome flaming Stories of Captain <HI>Avery,</HI>
and the fine things he had done in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
which were doubled and doubled even Ten Thou|&s;and-fold,
and from taking a great Prize in the
Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> where he took a Lady &s;aid to be
the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Daughter, with a great Quan|tity
of Jewels about her. We had a Story told
us, that he took a <HI>Mogul</HI> Ship, &s;o the fooli&s;h Sai|lors
called it, loaden with Diamonds.</P>
<P>I would fain have had Friend <HI>William</HI>'s Advice,
whither we &s;hould go, but he always put it off
with &s;ome <HI>Quaking</HI> Quibble or other. In &s;hort,
he did not care for directing us neither; whether
he made a Piece of Con&s;cience of it, or whether
he did not care to venture having it come again&s;t
him afterwards, or no, this I know not; but we
concluded at la&s;t without him.</P>
<P>We were however pretty long in re&s;olving,
and hanker'd about the <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> a long
time; at la&s;t we &s;py'd a Sail to Windward, and
it was &s;uch a Sail as I believe had not been &s;een in
that Part of the World a great while; it wanted
not that we &s;hould give it Cha&s;e, for it &s;tood di|rectly
towards us, as well as they that &s;teer'd
could make it; and even that was more Accident
<PB N="202" REF="204">
of Weather than any thing el&s;e: For if the Wind
had chopt about any where, they mu&s;t have gone
with it. I leave any Man that is a Sailor, or un|der&s;tands
any thing of a Ship, to judge what a
Figure this Ship made when we fir&s;t &s;aw her,
and what we could imagine was the Matter with
her. Her Main Top-Ma&s;t was come by the Board,
about &s;ix Foot above the Cap, and fell forward,
the Head of the Top-gallant Ma&s;t, hanging in
the Fore Shrouds by the Stay; at the &s;ame time
the Pareil of the Mizen Top&s;ail Yard, by
&s;ome Accident giving Way, the Mizen Top|&s;ail
Braces (the &s;tanding Part of which being
fa&s;t to the Main Top&s;ail Shrouds) brought the
Mizen Top&s;ail, Yard and all, down with it,
which &s;pread over Part of the Quarter Deck like
an Awning: The Fore-Top&s;ail was hoi&s;ted up
two Thirds of the Ma&s;t, but the Sheets were
flown. The Fore Yard was lower'd down upon
the Foreca&s;tle, the Sail loo&s;e, and Part of it
hanging over-board. In this Manner &s;he came
down upon us with the Wind quartering: In a
Word, the Figure the whole Ship made, was the
mo&s;t confounding to Men that under&s;tood the Sea,
that ever was &s;een; &s;he had no Boat, neither had
&s;he any Colours out.</P>
<P>When we came near to her, we fired a Gun to
bring her to. She took no Notice of it, nor of
us, but came on ju&s;t as &s;he did before. We fired
again, but 'twas all one: At length we came with|in
Pi&s;tol Shot of one another, but no body an|&s;wered
nor appeared; &s;o we began to think that
it was a Ship gone a&s;hore &s;omewhere in Di&s;tre&s;s,
and the Men having for&s;aken her, the high Tide
had floated her off to Sea. Coming nearer to her,
we run up along Side of her &s;o clo&s;e, that we
<PB N="203" REF="205">
could hear a Noi&s;e within her, and &s;ee the Mo|tion
of &s;everal People thro' her Ports.</P>
<P>Upon this we Mann'd our two Boats full of
Men, and very well armed, and ordered them to
board her at the &s;ame Minute, as near as they
could, and to enter one at her Fore-chains on one
Side, and the other a Mid-&s;hip on the other
Side. As &s;oon as they came to the Ship's Side,
a &s;urprizing Multitude of black Sailors, <HI>&s;uch
as they were,</HI> appeared upon Deck, and in &s;hort,
terrify'd our Men &s;o much, that the Boat
which was to enter her Men in the Wa&s;te,
&s;tood off again, and dur&s;t not board her; and
the Men that enter'd out of the other Boat,
finding the fir&s;t Boat, as they thought, beaten
off, and &s;eeing the Ship full of Men, jump'd all
back again into their Boat, and put off, not
knowing what the Matter was. Upon this we
prepared to pour in a Broad&s;ide upon her. But
our Friend <HI>William</HI> &s;et us to Rights again here;
for it &s;eems he gue&s;s'd how it was &s;ooner than
we did, and coming up to me (for it was our
Ship that came up with her) Friend, &s;ays he,
I am of Opinion thou art wrong in this Matter,
and thy Men have been wrong al&s;o in their Con|duct:
I'll tell thee how thou &s;halt take this
Ship, without making u&s;e of tho&s;e things call'd
Guns. How can that be, <HI>William,</HI> &s;aid I? Why,
&s;aid he, thou may&s;t take her with thy Helm;
thou &s;ee&s;t they keep no Steerage, and thou &s;ee&s;t
the Condition they are in; board her with thy
Ship upon her Lee Quarter, and &s;o enter her
from the Ship: I am per&s;waded thou wilt take
her without Fighting, for there is &s;ome Mi&s;chief
has befallen the Ship, which we know nothing
of.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206">
In a Word, it being a &s;mooth Sea, and little
Wind, I took his Advice, and lay'd her aboard.
Immediately our Men entred the Ship, where
we found a large Ship with upwards of 600 Ne|groes,
Men and Women, Boys and Girls, and not
one Chri&s;tian, or white Man, on board.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck with Horror at the Sight, for
immediately I concluded, as was partly the Ca&s;e,
that the&s;e black Devils had got loo&s;e, had mur|thered
all the white Men, and thrown them in|to
the Sea; and I had no &s;ooner told my Mind
to the Men, but the Thought of it &s;o enraged
them, that I had much ado to keep my Men
from cutting them all in Pieces. But <HI>William,</HI>
with many Per&s;wa&s;ions prevailed upon them,
by telling of them, that it was nothing but what,
if they were in the Negroes Condition, they
would do, if they could; and that the Negroes
had really the highe&s;t Inju&s;tice done them, to be
&s;old for Slaves without their Con&s;ent; and that
the Law of Nature dictated it to them; that they
ought not to kill them, and that it would be
wilful Murder to do it.</P>
<P>This prevailed with them, and cooled their
fir&s;t Heat; &s;o they only knock'd down twenty
or thirty of them, and the re&s;t run all down
between Decks, to their fir&s;t Places, believing,
as we fancy'd, that we were their fir&s;t Ma&s;ters
come again.</P>
<P>It was a mo&s;t unaccountable Difficulty we had
next, for we could not make them under&s;tand
one Word we &s;aid, nor could we under&s;tand one
Word our &s;elves that they &s;aid. We endea|voured
by Signs to ask them whence they came,
but they could make nothing of it; we pointed
to the Great Cabin, to the Round-hou&s;e, to the
<PB N="205" REF="207">
Cook-room, then to our Faces, to ask if they had
no white Men on board, and where they were
gone? But they could not under&s;tand what we
meant: On the other Hand, they pointed to our
Boat, and to their Ship, asking Que&s;tions as well
as they could, and &s;aid a Thou&s;and things, and
expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, but
we could not under&s;tand a Word of it all, or
know what they meant by any of their Signs.</P>
<P>We knew very well they mu&s;t have been taken
on board the Ship as Slaves, and that it mu&s;t be
by &s;ome <HI>European</HI> People too. We could ea&s;ily
&s;ee that the Ship was a <HI>Dutch</HI>-built Ship, but
very much alter'd, having been built upon, and
as we &s;uppo&s;e, in <HI>France;</HI> for we found two or
three <HI>French</HI> Books on board, and afterwards we
found Clothes, Linnen, Lace, &s;ome old Shoes,
and &s;everal other things: We found among the
Provi&s;ions, &s;ome Barrels of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Beef, &s;ome <HI>New|foundland</HI>
Fi&s;h, and &s;everal other Evidences that
there had been Chri&s;tians on board, but &s;aw no
Remains of them. We found not a Sword, Gun,
Pi&s;tol, or Weapon of any kind, except &s;ome
Cutla&s;&s;es; and the Negroes had hid them below
where they lay. We ask'd them what was be|come
of all the &s;mall Arms, pointing to our own,
and to the Places where tho&s;e belonging to the
Ship had hung: One of the Negroes under&s;tood
me pre&s;ently, and beckon'd to me to come up
upon the Deck, where taking my Fuzee, which
I never let go out of my Hand for &s;ome time
after we had ma&s;ter'd the Ship; I &s;ay, offering
to take hold of it, he made the proper Motion of
throwing it into the Sea, by which I under&s;tood,
as I did afterwards, that they had thrown all
the &s;mall Arms, Powder, Shot, Swords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in|to
<PB N="206" REF="208">
the Sea, believing, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, tho&s;e things
would kill them, tho' the Men were gone.</P>
<P>After we under&s;tood this, we made no Que&s;ti|on
but that the Ship's Crew having been &s;urpri|zed
by the&s;e de&s;perate Rogues, had gone the &s;ame
Way, and had been thrown over-board al&s;o. We
look'd all over the Ship, to &s;ee if we could find
any Blood, and we thought we did perceive &s;ome
in &s;everal Places; but the Heat of the Sun melt|ing
the Pitch and Tar upon the Decks, made it
impo&s;&s;ible for us to di&s;cern it exactly, except in
the Round-hou&s;e, where we plainly &s;aw that
there had been much Blood. We found the
Skuttle open, by which we &s;uppo&s;ed the Captain
and tho&s;e that were with him had made their
Retreat into the Great Cabin, or tho&s;e in the
Cabin had made their E&s;cape up into the Round-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But that which confirmed us mo&s;t of all in
what had happen'd, was, that upon farther En|quiry
we found that there were &s;even or eight
of the Negroes very much wounded, two or
three of them with Shot; whereof one had his
Leg broke, and lay in a mi&s;erable Condition, the
Fle&s;h being mortified, and, as our Friend <HI>William</HI>
&s;aid, in two Days more he would have died.
<HI>William</HI> was a mo&s;t dexterous Surgeon, and he
&s;hew'd it in this Cure; for tho' all the Surgeons
we had on board both our Ships (and we had no
le&s;s than five that called them&s;elves bred Surge|ons,
be&s;ides two or three who were Pretenders or
A&s;&s;i&s;tants) and all the&s;e gave their Opinion that
the Negroe's Leg mu&s;t be cut off, and that his
Life could not be &s;aved without it; that the
Mortification had touch'd the Marrow in the
Bone, that the Tendons were mortified, and that
<PB N="207" REF="209">
he could never have the U&s;e of his Leg, if it
&s;hould be cured. <HI>William</HI> &s;aid nothing in gene|ral,
but that his Opinion was otherwi&s;e, and that
he de&s;ired the Wound might be &s;earch'd, and
that he would then tell them farther. Accor|dingly
he went to Work with the Leg, and, as
he de&s;ired he might have &s;ome of the Surgeons
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, we appointed him two of the able&s;t
of them to help, and all of them to look on, if
they thought fit.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> went to Work his own Way, and &s;ome
of them pretended to find Fault at fir&s;t. Howe|ver,
he proceeded, and &s;earch'd every Part of
the Leg where he &s;u&s;pected the Mortification had
touch'd it: In a Word, he cut off a great deal
of mortified Fle&s;h; in all which the poor Fellow
felt no Pain. <HI>William</HI> proceeded till he brought
the Ve&s;&s;els which he had cut to bleed, and the
Man to cry out: Then he reduced the Splinters
of the Bone, and calling for Help, <HI>&s;et it, as we call
it,</HI> and bound it up, and laid the Man to Re&s;t,
who found him&s;elf much ea&s;ier than before.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t Opening, the Surgeons began to
triumph, the Mortification &s;eem'd to &s;pread, and
a long red Streak of Blood appeared from the
Wound upwards to the Middle of the Man's
Thigh, and the Surgeons told me the Man would
die in a few Hours. I went to look at it, and
found <HI>William</HI> him&s;elf under &s;ome Surprize; but
when I ask'd him how long he thought the poor
Fellow could live, he look'd gravely up at me,
and &s;aid, <HI>As long as thou can&s;t:</HI> I am not at all
apprehen&s;ive of his Life, &s;aid he, but I would
cure him if I could, without making a Cripple of
him. I found he was not ju&s;t then upon the Ope|ration,
as to his Leg, but was mixing up &s;ome|thing
<PB N="208" REF="210">
to give the poor Creature, to repel, as I
thought, the &s;preading Contagion, and to abate
or prevent any feveri&s;h Temper that might
happen in the Blood: After which he went to
Work again, and open'd the Leg in two Pla|ces
above the Wound, cutting out a great deal
of mortified Fle&s;h, which it &s;eems was occa&s;io|ned
by the Bandage which had pre&s;s'd the Parts
too much, and withal, the Blood being at that
time in a more than common Di&s;po&s;ition to
mortify, might a&s;&s;i&s;t to &s;pread it.</P>
<P>Well, our Friend <HI>William</HI> conquer'd all this,
clear'd the &s;preading Mortification, that the red
Streak went off again, the Fle&s;h began to heal,
and Matter to run; and in a few Days the Man's
Spirits began to recover, his Pul&s;e beat regular,
he had no Fever, and gathered Strength daily;
and in a Word he was a perfect &s;ound Man in
about ten Weeks, and we kept him among&s;t us,
and made him an able Seaman. But to return
to the Ship, we never could come at a certain In|formation
about it, till &s;ome of the Negroes which
we kept on board, and whom we taught to &s;peak
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> gave the Account of it afterwards, and
this maim'd Man in particular.</P>
<P>We enquired by all the Signs and Motions
we could imagine, what was become of the Peo|ple,
and yet we could get nothing from them.
Our Lieutenant was for torturing &s;ome of them
to make them confe&s;s; but <HI>William</HI> oppo&s;ed that
vehemently; and when he heard it was under
Con&s;ideration, he came to me, Friend, &s;ays he,
I make a Reque&s;t to thee, not to put any of
the&s;e poor Wretches to Torment. Why, <HI>Willi|am,</HI>
&s;aid I, why not? You &s;ee they will not give
any Account of what is become of the white
<PB N="209" REF="211">
Men. Nay, &s;ays <HI>William,</HI> do not &s;ay &s;o; I &s;up|po&s;e
they have given thee a full Account of every
Particular of it. How &s;o, &s;ays I, pray what are
we the wi&s;er for all their Jabbering? Nay, &s;ays
<HI>William,</HI> that may be thy Fault, for ought I
know; thou wilt not puni&s;h the poor Men be|cau&s;e
they cannot &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and perhaps they
never heard a Word of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> before. Now I
may very well &s;uppo&s;e, that they have given
thee a large Account of every thing; for thou
&s;ee&s;t with what Earne&s;tne&s;s, and how long &s;ome
of them have talk'd to thee, and if thou can&s;t
not under&s;tand their Language, nor they thine,
how can they help that; at the be&s;t thou doe&s;t
but &s;uppo&s;e that they have not told thee the
whole Truth of the Story, and on the contrary
I &s;uppo&s;e they have, and how wilt thou decide
the Que&s;tion, whether thou art right, or whether
I am right? Be&s;ides, what can they &s;ay to thee,
when thou aske&s;t them a Que&s;tion upon the Tor|ture,
and at the &s;ame time they do not under|&s;tand
the Que&s;tion, and thou doe&s;t not know
whether they &s;ay <HI>Ay</HI> or <HI>No?</HI></P>
<P>It is no Complement to my Moderation, to &s;ay
I was convinc'd by the&s;e Rea&s;ons; and yet we
had all much ado to keep our &s;econd Lieute|nant
from murthering &s;ome of them to make
them tell. What if they had told, he did not
under&s;tand one Word of it; but he would not
be per&s;waded but that the Negroes mu&s;t needs
under&s;tand him, when he ask'd them, whether
the Ship had any Boat or no, like ours, and what
was become of it?</P>
<P>But there was no Remedy but to wait till
we made the&s;e People under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and
to adjourn the Story till that time. The Ca&s;e was
<PB N="210" REF="212">
thus. Where they were taken on board the
Ship, that we could never under&s;tand, becau&s;e they
never knew the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Names which we give to
tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, or what Nation they were who be|long'd
to the Ship, becau&s;e they knew not one
Tongue from another; but thus far the Negroe
I examin'd, who was the &s;ame who&s;e Leg <HI>William</HI>
had cured, told us, that they did not &s;peak the
&s;ame Language we &s;poke, nor the &s;ame our <HI>Portu|gueze</HI>
&s;poke; &s;o that in all Probability they mu&s;t
be <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Then he told us, that the white Men u&s;ed
them barbarou&s;ly; that they beat them unmer|cifully;
that one of the Negroe Men had a Wife,
and two Negroe Children, one a Daughter about
&s;ixteen Years old; that a White Man abu&s;ed the
Negroe Man's Wife, and afterwards his Daugh|ter,
which, as he &s;aid, made all the Negroe Men
mad; and that the Woman's Husband was in a
great Rage, at which the White Man was &s;o pro|voked,
that he threaten'd to kill him; but in
the Night, the Negroe Man being loo&s;e, got a
great Club, by which he made us under&s;tand he
meant a Hand&s;pike, and that when the &s;ame
<HI>Frenchman</HI> (<HI>if it was a</HI> Frenchman) came among
them again, he began again to abu&s;e the Ne|groe
Man's Wife; at which the Negroe taking
up the Hand&s;pike, knock'd his Brains out at one
Blow; and then taking the Key from him with
which he u&s;ually unlock'd the Hand-cuffs which
the Negroes were fetter'd with, he &s;et about a
Hundred of them at Liberty, who getting up
upon the Deck by the &s;ame Skuttle that the
White Man came down; and taking the Man's
Cutla&s;s who was killed, and laying hold of what
came next them, they fell upon the Men that
<PB N="211" REF="213">
were upon the Deck, and killed them all, and
afterwards tho&s;e they found upon the Foreca&s;tle;
that the Captain and his other Men, who were
in the Cabin, and the Round-hou&s;e, defended
them&s;elves with great Courage, and &s;hot out at
the Loopholes at them, by which he and &s;everal
other Men were wounded, and &s;ome killed; but
that they broke into the Round-hou&s;e after a
long Di&s;pute, where they killed two of the
white Men, but own'd that the two white Men
killed eleven of their Men before they could
break in; and then the re&s;t having got down
the Skuttle into the Great Cabin, wounded three
more of them.</P>
<P>That after this, the Gunner of the Ship ha|ving
&s;ecured him&s;elf in the Gun-room, one of
his Men haul'd up the Long-Boat clo&s;e under
the Stern, and putting into her all the Arms
and Ammunition they could come at, got all in|to
the Boat, and afterwards took in the Captain,
and tho&s;e that were with him, out of the Great
Cabin. When they were all thus embark'd, they
re&s;olved to lay the Ship aboard again, and try to
recover it; that they boarded the Ship in a de|&s;perate
Manner, and killed at fir&s;t all that &s;tood
in their Way; but the Negroes being by this
time all loo&s;e, and having gotten &s;ome Arms,
tho' they under&s;tood nothing of Powder and
Bullet, or Guns; yet the Men could never ma|&s;ter
them. However, they lay under the Ship's
Bow, and got out all the Men they had left in the
Cook-room, who had maintained them&s;elves
there, notwith&s;tanding all the Negroes could do,
and with their &s;mall Arms killed between thirty
and forty of the Negroes, but were at la&s;t forc'd
to leave them.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214">
They could give me no Account whereabouts
this was, whether near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africk,</HI> or
far off, or how long it was before the Ship fell
into our Hands; only in general, it was a great
while ago, <HI>as they called it,</HI> and by all we could
learn, it was within two or three Days after they
had &s;et Sail from the Coa&s;t. They told us, that
they had killed about thirty of the white Men,
having knock'd them on the Head with Crows and
Hand-&s;pikes, and &s;uch things as they could get;
and one &s;trong Negroe killed three of them with
an Iron Crow, after he was &s;hot twice thro' the
Body, and that he was afterwards &s;hot thro' the
Head by the Captain him&s;elf at the Door of
the Round-hou&s;e, which he had &s;plit open with
the Crow; and this we &s;uppo&s;e was the Occa|&s;ion
of the great Quantity of Blood which we
&s;aw at the Round-hou&s;e Door.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Negroe told us, that they threw all
the Powder and Shot they could find, into the
Sea, and they would have thrown the great Guns
into the Sea, if they could have lifted them.
Being ask'd how they came to have their Sails
in &s;uch a Condition, his An&s;wer was, <HI>they no un|der&s;tand,
they no know what the Sails do;</HI> that was,
they did not &s;o much as know that it was the
Sails that made the Ship go; or under&s;tand what
they meant, or what to do with them. When
we asked him whither they were going, he &s;aid,
they did not know, but believed they &s;hould go
Home to their own Country again. I asked
him in particular, what he thought we were,
when we came fir&s;t up with them? He &s;aid,
they were terribly frighted, believing we were
the &s;ame white Men that had gone away in their
Boats, and were come again in a great Ship, with
<PB N="213" REF="215">
the two Boats with them, and expected they
would kill them all.</P>
<P>This was the Account we got out of them,
after we had taught them to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
to under&s;tand the Names and U&s;e of the things
belonging to the Ship, which they had Occa|&s;ion
to &s;peak of, and we ob&s;erved that the Fel|lows
were too innocent to di&s;&s;emble in their
Relation, and that they all agreed in the Par|ticulars,
and were always in the &s;ame Story,
which confirm'd very much the Truth of what
they &s;aid.</P>
<P>Having taken this Ship, our next Difficulty
was, what to do with the Negroes. The <HI>Portu|gueze</HI>
in the <HI>Bra&s;ils</HI> would have bought them all of
us, and been glad of the Purcha&s;e, if we had
not &s;hew'd our &s;elves Enemies there, and been
known for Pyrates; but as it was, we dur&s;t not
go on Shore any where thereabouts, or treat with
any of the Planters, becau&s;e we &s;hould rai&s;e the
whole Country upon us; and if there were any
&s;uch things as Men of War in any of their
Ports, we &s;hould be a&s;&s;ured to be attack'd by
them, and by all the Force they had by Land
or Sea.</P>
<P>Nor could we think of any better Succe&s;s,
if we went Northward to our own Plantations.
One while we determined to carry them all away
to the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and &s;ell them there to the
<HI>Spaniards;</HI> but they were really too many for
them to make U&s;e of; and to carry them round
to the South-Seas, which was the only Remedy
that was left, was &s;o far, that we &s;hould be
no Way able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them for &s;o long a
Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216">
At la&s;t, our old never-failing Friend <HI>William</HI>
help'd us out again, as he had often done, at
a Dead-lift. His Propo&s;al was this, that he
&s;hould go as Ma&s;ter of the Ship, and about
twenty Men &s;uch as we could be&s;t tru&s;t, and
attempt to trade privately upon the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> with the Planters, not at the principal
Ports, becau&s;e that would not be admitted.</P>
<P>We all agreed to this, and appointed to go
away our &s;elves towards the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> where
we had Thought of going before, and to wait
for him not there, but at <HI>Port St. Pedro,</HI> as the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> call it, lying at the Mouth of the Ri|ver
which they call <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> and where the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> had a &s;mall Fort, and a few People,
but we believe there was no Body in it.</P>
<P>Here we took up our Station, crui&s;ing off and
on, to &s;ee if we could meet any Ships going
to, or coming from the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> or the <HI>Rio
de la Plata;</HI> but we met with nothing worth
Notice. However, we employed our &s;elves in
things nece&s;&s;ary for our going off to Sea; for
we filled all our Water Casks, and got &s;ome Fi&s;h
for our pre&s;ent U&s;e, to &s;pare as much as po&s;&s;i|ble
our Ship's Stores.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> in the mean time went away to the
North, and made the Land about the <HI>Cape de
St. Thomas,</HI> and betwixt that and the I&s;les <HI>de
Tuberon,</HI> he found Means to trade with the Plan|ters
for all his Negroes, as well the Women as
the Men, and at a very good Price too; for <HI>Willi|am,</HI>
who &s;poke <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> pretty well, told them a
fair Story enough, that the Ship was in Scarcity
of Provi&s;ions, that they were driven a great
Way out of their Way, and indeed, <HI>as we &s;ay,</HI>
out of their Knowledge, and that they mu&s;t go
<PB N="215" REF="217">
up to the Northward as far as <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or &s;ell
there upon the Coa&s;t. This was a very plau|&s;ible
Tale, and was ea&s;ily believed; and if you
ob&s;erve the Manner of the Negroes Sailing, and
what happened in their Voyage, was every Word
of it true.</P>
<P>By this Method, and being true to one ano|ther,
<HI>William</HI> pa&s;t for what he was; I mean, for
a very hone&s;t Fellow, and by A&s;&s;i&s;tance of one
Planter, who &s;ent to &s;ome of his Neighbour
Planters, and managed the Trade among them|&s;elves,
he got a quick Market; for in le&s;s than
five Weeks, <HI>William</HI> &s;old all his Negroes, and at
la&s;t &s;old the Ship it &s;elf, and &s;hipp'd him&s;elf and
his twenty Men, and two Negroe Boys whom he
had left, in a Sloop, one of tho&s;e which the Plan|ters
u&s;ed to &s;end on board for the Negroes.
With this Sloop Captain <HI>William,</HI> as we then cal|led
him, came away, and found us at <HI>Port St. Pe|dro,</HI>
in the Latitude of 32 Degrees, 30 Minutes
South.</P>
<P>Nothing was more &s;urprizing to us, than to
&s;ee a Sloop come along the Coa&s;t, carrying <HI>Por|tugueze</HI>
Colours, and come in directly to us, after
we were a&s;&s;ured he had di&s;covered both our
Ships. We fired a Gun upon her nearer Ap|proach,
to bring her to an Anchor, but imme|diately
&s;he fired five Guns by Way of Salute,
and &s;pread her <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Antient: Then we began
to gue&s;s it was Friend <HI>William,</HI> but wondered
what was the Meaning of his being in a Sloop,
whereas we &s;ent him away in a Ship of near
300 Tuns; but he &s;oon let us into the whole
Hi&s;tory of his Management, with which we had
a great deal of Rea&s;on to be very well &s;atisfy'd.
As &s;oon as he had brought the Sloop to an An|chor,
<PB N="216" REF="218">
he came aboard of my Ship, and there
he gave us an Account how he began to
trade, by the Help of a <HI>Portugueze</HI> Planter,
who lived near the Sea-&s;ide; how he went
on Shore, and went up to the fir&s;t Hou&s;e he
could &s;ee, and asked the Man of the Hou&s;e to
&s;ell him &s;ome Hoggs, pretending at fir&s;t he on|ly
&s;tood in upon the Coa&s;t to take in fre&s;h Wa|ter,
and buy &s;ome Provi&s;ions; and the Man not
only &s;old him &s;even fat Hoggs, but invited him
in, and gave him and five Men he had with him,
a very good Dinner, and he invited the Planter
on board his Ship, and in Return for his Kind|ne&s;s,
gave him a Negroe Girl for his Wife.</P>
<P>This &s;o obliged the Planter, that the next
Morning he &s;ent him on board, in a great
Luggage Boat, a Cow and two Sheep, with a
Che&s;t of Sweet-meats, and &s;ome Sugar, and a
great Bag of Tobacco, and invited Captain <HI>William</HI>
on Shore again: That after this, they grew from
one Kindne&s;s to another, that they began to talk
about Trading for &s;ome Negroes; and <HI>William</HI>
pretending it was to do him Service, con&s;ented
to &s;ell him thirty Negroes for his private U&s;e
in his Plantation, for which he gave <HI>William</HI>
ready Money in Gold, at the Rate of five and
thirty Moydores <HI>per</HI> Head; but the Planter was
obliged to u&s;e great Caution in the bringing them
on Shore: For which Purpo&s;e, he made <HI>William</HI>
weigh and &s;tand out to Sea, and put in again,
above fifty Miles farther North, where at a
little Creek he took the Negroes on Shore at
another Plantation, being a Friend's of his whom
it &s;eems he could tru&s;t.</P>
<P>This Remove brought <HI>William</HI> into a farther In|timacy,
not only with the fir&s;t Planter, but al&s;o
<PB N="217" REF="219">
with his Friends, who de&s;ired to have &s;ome of the
Negroes al&s;o; &s;o that from one to another, they
bought &s;o many, till one over-grown Planter took
100 Negroes, which was all <HI>William</HI> had left, and
&s;haring them with another Planter, that other
Planter chaffer'd with <HI>William</HI> for Ship and all,
giving him in Exchange a very clean, large,
well-built Sloop of near &s;ixty Tons, very well
furni&s;h'd, carrying &s;ix Guns, but we made her
afterwards carry twelve Guns. <HI>William</HI> had 300
Moydores of Gold, be&s;ides the Sloop, in Payment
for the Ship, and with this Money, he &s;tored the
Sloop as full as &s;he could hold with Provi&s;ions,
e&s;pecially Bread, &s;ome Pork, and about &s;ixty
Hoggs alive: Among the re&s;t, <HI>William</HI> got eighty
Barrels of good Gunpowder, which was very
much for our Purpo&s;e, and all the Provi&s;ions
which were in the <HI>French</HI> Ship he took out al&s;o.</P>
<P>This was a very agreeable Account to us, e&s;pe|cially
when we &s;aw, that <HI>William</HI> had received in
Gold coin'd, or by Weight, and &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sil|ver,
60000 Pieces of Eight, be&s;ides a new Sloop,
and a va&s;t Quantity of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>We were very glad of the Sloop in particular,
and began to con&s;ult what we &s;hould do, whe|ther
we had not be&s;t turn off our great <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
Ship, and &s;tick to our fir&s;t Ship and the Sloop,
&s;eeing we had &s;carce Men enough for all three,
and that the bigge&s;t Ship was thought too big
for our Bu&s;ine&s;s; however, another Di&s;pute which
was now decided, brought the fir&s;t to a Conclu&s;ion.
The fir&s;t Di&s;pute was, whither we &s;hould go? My
Comrade, as I called him now, that is to &s;ay, he
that was my Captain before we took this <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI>
Man of War, was for going to the South
Seas, and coa&s;ting up the We&s;t Side of <HI>America,</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="220">
where we could not fail of making &s;everal good
Prizes upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and that then if Oc|ca&s;ion
required, we might come home by the
South-Seas to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and &s;o go round the
Globe as others had done before us.</P>
<P>But my Head lay another Way, I had been in
the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and had entertained a Notion
ever &s;ince that, that if we went thither we could
not fail of making good Work of it, and that we
might have a &s;afe Retreat, and good Beef to Victual
our Ship, among my old Friends the Natives of
<HI>Zamguebar,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> or the
I&s;land of St. <HI>Laurence:</HI> I &s;ay, my Thoughts lay this
Way and I read &s;o many Lectures to them all, of the
Advantages they would certainly make of their
Strength, by the Prizes they would take in the
Gulph of <HI>Mocha</HI> or the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> and on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Malabar</HI> or the Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> that I amaz'd them.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Arguments I prevailed on them,
and we all re&s;olved to &s;teer away S. E. for the
Cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI> and in Con&s;equence of this
Re&s;olution, we concluded to keep the Sloop, and
&s;ail with all three, no doubting, as I a&s;&s;ured them,
but we &s;hould find Men there to make up the
Number wanting, and if not, we might ca&s;t any
of them off when we plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>We could do no le&s;s than make our Friend
<HI>William</HI> Captain of the Sloop, which with &s;uch
good Management he had brought us. He told
us, tho' with much good Manners, he would
not command her as a Fregat, but if we would
give her to him for his Share of the <HI>Guinea</HI> Ship,
which we came very hone&s;tly by, he would keep
us Company as a Victualler, if we commanded
him, as long as he was under the &s;ame Force
that took him away.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">
We under&s;tood him, &s;o we gave him the Sloop,
but upon Condition that he &s;hould not go from
us, and &s;hould be entirely under our Command:
However, <HI>William</HI> was not &s;o ea&s;y as before; and
indeed, as we afterwards wanted the Sloop, to
crui&s;e for Purcha&s;e, and a Right thorow-paced
Pyrate in her; &s;o I was in &s;uch Pain for <HI>William,</HI>
that I could not be without him, for he was my
Privy-Coun&s;ellour and Companion upon all Oc|ca&s;ions;
&s;o I put a <HI>Scot&s;man,</HI> a bold enterprizing
gallant Fellow into her, named <HI>Gordon,</HI> and made
her carry 12 Guns, and four Paterero's, though
indeed we wanted Men, for we were none of us
Mann'd in Proportion to our Force.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed away for the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> the
Beginning of <HI>October</HI> 1706, and pa&s;&s;ed by in
Sight of the Cape, the 12 of <HI>November</HI> follow|ing,
having met with a great deal of bad Wea|ther:
We &s;aw &s;everal Merchant Ships in the
Road there, as well <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as <HI>Dutch,</HI> whether
outward bound or homeward we could not tell;
<HI>be it what it would,</HI> we did not think fit to come to
an Anchor, not knowing what they might be,
or what they might attempt again&s;t us, when
they knew what we were: However, as we wanted
fre&s;h Water, we &s;ent the two Boats belonging to
the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Man of War, with all <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
Seamen or <HI>Negroes</HI> in them, to the Watering
Place, to take in Water: And in the mean time
we hung out a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Antient at Sea, and lay by
all that Night. They knew not what we was,
but it &s;eems we pa&s;t for any thing but really what
we was.</P>
<P>Our Boats returning the third time loaden,
about five a Clock next Morning, we thought
our &s;elves &s;ufficiently water'd, and &s;tood away
<PB N="220" REF="222">
to the Ea&s;tward; but before our Men returned
the la&s;t time, the Wind blowing an ea&s;y Gale at
We&s;t, we perceived a Boat in the Grey of the
Morning, under Sail, crowding to come up with
us, as if they were afraid we &s;hould be gone.
We &s;oon found it was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Long-Boat, and
that it was pretty full of Men; we could not
imagine what the Meaning of it &s;hould be; but
as it was but a Boat, we thought there could
be no great Harm in it to let them come on
board: And if it appeared they came only to
enquire who we were, we would give them a full
Account of our Bu&s;ine&s;s, by taking them along
with us, &s;eeing we wanted Men as much as any
thing; but they &s;aved us the Labour of being in
doubt how to di&s;po&s;e of them, for it &s;eems our
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Seamen who went for Water, had not
been &s;o &s;ilent at the Watering Place, as we
thought they would have been. But the Ca&s;e,
in &s;hort was this. Captain, <HI>I forbear
his Name at pre&s;ent, for a particular Rea&s;on,</HI> Captain
of an <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Merchant Ship, bound after|wards
for <HI>China,</HI> had found &s;ome Rea&s;on to be
very &s;evere with his Men, and had handled &s;ome
of them very roughly at St. <HI>Helena;</HI> in&s;omuch,
that they threaten'd among them&s;elves to leave
the Ship the fir&s;t Opportunity, and had long
wi&s;h'd for that Opportunity: Some of the&s;e
Men, it &s;eems, had met with our Boat at the Wa|tering
Place, and enquiring of one another who
we were, and upon what Account; whether the
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Seamen, by faultring in their Account,
made them &s;u&s;pect that we were out upon the
Crui&s;e, or whether they told it in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
or no (for they all &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> enough to be un|der&s;tood)
but &s;o it was, that as &s;oon as ever the
<PB N="221" REF="223">
Men carried the News on board, that the Ships
which lay by to the Ea&s;tward were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
that they were going upon <HI>the Account,</HI> which by
the Way was a Sea Term for a Pyrate; I &s;ay, as
&s;oon as ever they heard it, they went to work,
and getting all things ready in the Night, their
Che&s;ts and Clothes, and whatever el&s;e they could,
they came away before it was Day, and came up
with us about &s;even a Clock.</P>
<P>When they came by the Ship's Side which I
commanded, we hailed them in the u&s;ual Man|ner,
to know what and who they were, and
what their Bu&s;ine&s;s? They an&s;wered, they were
<HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and de&s;ired to come aboard: We told
them they might lay the Ship on board, but or|dered
they &s;hould let only one Man enter the
Ship, till the Captain knew their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
that he &s;hould come without any Arms: They
&s;aid Ay, with all their Hearts.</P>
<P>We pre&s;ently found their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and that
they de&s;ired to go with us; and as for their Arms,
they de&s;ired we would &s;end Men on board the
Boat, and that they would deliver them all to us,
which was done. The Fellow that came up to
me, told me how they had been u&s;ed by their
Captain, how he had &s;tarved the Men, and u&s;ed
them like Dogs; and that if the re&s;t of the Men
knew they &s;hould be admitted, he was &s;atisfied
two Thirds of them would leave the Ship. We
found the Fellows were very hearty in their Re|&s;olution,
and jolly brisk Sailors they were; &s;o I
told them I would do nothing without our Admi|ral,
that was, the Captain of the other Ship: So
I &s;ent my Pinnace on board Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> to
de&s;ire him to come on board; but he was indi&s;po|&s;ed,
and being to Leeward, excu&s;ed his coming,
<PB N="222" REF="224">
but left it all to me: But before my Boat was
returned, Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> called to me by his
Speaking Trumpet, which all the Men might
hear as well as I, thus, calling me by my Name,
<HI>I hear they are hone&s;t Fellows, pray tell them they are
all welcome, and make them a Bowl of Punch.</HI></P>
<P>As the Men heard it as well as I, there was
no need to tell them what the Captain &s;aid; and
as &s;oon as the Trumpet had done, they &s;et up a
Huzza that &s;hewed us they were very hearty in
their coming to us; but we bound them to us by
a &s;tronger Obligation &s;till, after this: For when
we came to <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> with
Con&s;ent of all the Ship's Company, ordered that
the&s;e Men &s;hould have as much Money given
them out of the Stock, as was due to them for
their Pay in the Ship they had left; and after
that, we allowed them Twenty Pieces of Eight
a Man Bounty Money: And thus we entred them
upon Shares, as we were all, and brave &s;tout Fel|lows
they were, being Eighteen in Number,
whereof two were Mid&s;hip-Men, and one a Car|penter.</P>
<P>It was the 28th of <HI>November,</HI> when having had
&s;ome bad Weather, we came to an Anchor in the
Road off of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> Bay, at the South We&s;t
End of my old Acquaintance the I&s;le of <HI>Madaga&s;|car:</HI>
We lay here a while, and traffick'd with the
Natives for &s;ome good Beef, tho' the Weather
was &s;o hot, that we could not promi&s;e our &s;elves to
&s;alt any of it up to keep; but I &s;hewed them the
Way which we practi&s;ed before, to &s;alt it fir&s;t
with <HI>Salt-Petre,</HI> then cure it, by drying it in the
Sun, which made it eat very agreeably, tho' tho' not
&s;o whole&s;ome for our Men, that not agreeing with
our Way of Cooking, <HI>viz.</HI> Boiling with Pud|ding,
<PB N="223" REF="225">
Brewes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and particularly this Way
would be too &s;alt, and the Fat of the Meat be
re&s;ty, or dry'd away, &s;o as not to be eaten.</P>
<P>This however we could not help, and made
our &s;elves amends by feeding heartily on the fre&s;h
Beef while we were there, which was excellent
good and fat, every Way as tender, and as well
reli&s;hed as in <HI>England,</HI> and thought to be much
better to us who had not ta&s;ted any in <HI>England</HI> for
&s;o long a Time.</P>
<P>Having now for &s;ome time remained here,
we began to con&s;ider that this was not a Place for
our Bu&s;ine&s;s; and I that had &s;ome Views, a parti|cular
Way of my own, told them, that this was
not a Station for tho&s;e that look'd for Purcha&s;e;
that there were two Parts of the I&s;land which
were particularly proper for our Purpo&s;es; fir&s;t
the Bay on the Ea&s;t Side of the I&s;land, and
from thence to the I&s;land <HI>Mauritius,</HI> which was
the u&s;ual Way which Ships that came from the
<HI>Malabar</HI> Coa&s;t, or the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> Fore
<HI>St. George,</HI> &amp;c. u&s;ed to take, and where, if we
waited for them, we ought to take our Station.</P>
<P>But on the other Hand, as we did not re&s;olve
to fall upon the <HI>European</HI> Traders, who were
generally Ships of Force, and well Manned, and
where Blows mu&s;t be looked for; &s;o I had an|other
Pro&s;pect, which I promi&s;ed my &s;elf would
yield equal Profit, or perhaps greater, without
any of the Hazard and Difficulty of the former,
and this was the Gulph of <HI>Mocha</HI> or the <HI>Red
Sea.</HI></P>
<P>I told them that the Trade here was great, the
Ships rich, and the Streight of <HI>Babelmandel</HI> narrow;
&s;o that there was no doubt but we might crui&s;e
&s;o as to let nothing &s;lip our Hands, having the
<PB N="224" REF="226">
Seas open from the <HI>Red Sea</HI> along the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Arabia,</HI> to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph, and the <HI>Malabar</HI> Side
of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I told them, what I had ob&s;erved when I &s;ailed
round the I&s;land, in my former Progre&s;s, how
that on the Northmo&s;t Point of the I&s;land were
&s;everal very good Harbours, and Roads for our
Ships: That the Natives were even more civil,
and tractable, if po&s;&s;ible, than tho&s;e where we
were, not having been &s;o often ill treated by
<HI>European</HI> Sailors, as tho&s;e had in the South and
Ea&s;t Sides; and that we might always be &s;ure of
a Retreat, if we were driven to put in by any Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
either of Enemies or of Weather.</P>
<P>They were ea&s;ily convinced of the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s
of my Scheme, and Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> whom
I now called our Admiral, tho' he was at fir&s;t
of the Mind to go and lye at the I&s;land <HI>Mauritius,</HI>
and wait for &s;ome of the <HI>European</HI> Merchant
Ships from the Road of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> or the Bay
of <HI>Bengal,</HI> was now of my Mind. It is true,
we were &s;trong enough to have attacked an <HI>Eng|li&s;h
Ea&s;t India</HI> Ship of the greate&s;t Force, though
&s;ome of them were &s;aid to carry fifty Guns; but
I repre&s;ented to him, that we were &s;ure to have
Blows, and Blood if we took them, and after
we had done, their Loading was not of equal
Value to us, becau&s;e we had no room to di&s;po&s;e
of their Merchandize: And as our Circum&s;tances
&s;tood, we had rather have taken one outward
bound <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Ship, with her ready Ca&s;h on
board, perhaps to the Vallue of forty or fifty
Thou&s;and Pound, than three homeward bound,
though their Loading would at <HI>London</HI> be worth
three times the Money; becau&s;e, we knew not
whither to go to di&s;po&s;e of the Cargo; whereas
<PB N="209" REF="227">
the Ships from <HI>London</HI> had Abundance of things
we knew how to make u&s;e of, be&s;ides their Mo|ney;
&s;uch as their Stores of Provi&s;ions, and Li|quors,
and great Quantities of the like &s;ent to
the Governours and Factories at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settle|ments,
for their U&s;e: So that if we re&s;olved to
look for our own Country Ships, it &s;hould be
tho&s;e that were outward bound, not the <HI>London</HI>
Ships homeward.</P>
<P>All the&s;e things con&s;idered, brought the
Admiral to be of my Mind entirely; &s;o af|ter
taking in Water, and &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;i|ons
where we lay, which was near <HI>Cape St. Mary,</HI>
on the South-We&s;t Corner of the I&s;land, we
weighed, and &s;tood away South, and afterwards
S.S.E. to round the I&s;land, and in about &s;ix Days
Sail, got out of the Wake of the I&s;land, and
&s;teer'd away North, till we came off of <HI>Port
Dauphin,</HI> and then North by Ea&s;t, to the Latitude
of 13 Degrees, 40 Minutes, which was, in &s;hort,
ju&s;t at the farthe&s;t Part of the I&s;land; and the
Admiral keeping a-head, made the open Sea fair
to the We&s;t, clear of the whole I&s;land; upon
which he brought to, and we &s;ent the Sloop to
&s;tand in round the farthe&s;t Point North, and
coa&s;t along the Shore, and &s;ee for a Harbour
to put into, which they did, and &s;oon brought
us an Account, that there was a deep Bay, with
a very good Road, and &s;everal little I&s;lands under
which they found good Riding, in 10 to 17 Fa|thom
Water, and accordingly there we put in.</P>
<P>However, we afterwards found Occa&s;ion to
remove our Station, as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.
We had now nothing to do, but go on Shore,
and acquaint our &s;elves a little with the Natives,
take in fre&s;h Water, and &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions,
<PB N="210" REF="228">
and then to Sea again. We found the People ve|ry
ea&s;y to deal with, and &s;ome Cattel they had;
but it being at the Extremity of the I&s;land,
they had not &s;uch Quantities of Cattel here.
However, for the pre&s;ent, we re&s;olved to ap|point
this for our Place of Rendezvous, and go
and look out. This was about the latter End
of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly we put to Sea, and crui&s;ed away
to the Northward, for the <HI>Arabian</HI> Coa&s;t: It was
a long Run; but as the Winds generally blow
Trade from the South, and S.S.E. from <HI>May</HI>
to <HI>September,</HI> we had good Weather, and in about
twenty Days we made the I&s;land of <HI>Saccatia,</HI>
lying South from the <HI>Arabian</HI> Coa&s;t, and E.S.E.
from the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Mocha,</HI> or the
Red Sea.</P>
<P>Here we took in Water, and &s;tood off and on
upon the <HI>Arabian</HI> Shore. We had not crui&s;ed
here above three Days, or thereabouts, but I
&s;py'd a Sail, and gave her Cha&s;e; but when we
came up with her, never was &s;uch a poor Prize
cha&s;ed by Pyrates that look'd for Booty; for we
found nothing in her, but poor, half-naked <HI>Turks</HI>
going a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca,</HI> to the Tomb of
their Prophet <HI>Mahomet;</HI> the Jonk that carry'd
them had no one thing worth taking away, but
a little Rice, and &s;ome Coffee, which was all the
poor Wretches had for their Sub&s;i&s;tence; &s;o we
let them go, for indeed we knew not what to do
with them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Evening we cha&s;ed another Jonk
with two Ma&s;ts, and in &s;omething better Plight
to look at than the former. When we came
on board, we found them upon the &s;ame Errand,
but only that they were People of &s;ome better
<PB N="211" REF="229">
Fa&s;hion than the other; and here we got &s;ome
Plunder, &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Stores, a few Diamonds in
the Ear-drops of five or &s;ix Per&s;ons, &s;ome fine
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Carpets, of which they made their Saffra's
to lye upon, and &s;ome Money; &s;o we let them go
al&s;o.</P>
<P>We continued here eleven Days longer, and
&s;aw nothing but now and then a Fi&s;hing-Boat;
but the twelfth Day of our Crui&s;e, we &s;py'd a
Ship: Indeed I thought at fir&s;t it had been an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, but it appeared to be an <HI>European</HI>
freighted for a Voyage from <HI>Goa,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Malabar,</HI> to the Red Sea, and was very rich. We
cha&s;ed her, and took her, without any Fight,
tho' they had &s;ome Guns on board too, but not
many. We found her Manned with <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
Seamen, but under the Direction of five Mer|chant
<HI>Turks,</HI> who had hired her on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Malabar,</HI> of &s;ome <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchants, and had
loaden her with Pepper, Salt-petre, &s;ome Spices,
and the re&s;t of the Loading was chiefly Callicoes
and wrought Silks, &s;ome of them very rich.</P>
<P>We took her, and carried her to <HI>Saccatia,</HI> but
we really knew not what to do with her, for the
&s;ame Rea&s;ons as before; for all their Goods were
of little or no Value to us. After &s;ome Days we
found Means to let one of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Merchants
know, that if he would ran&s;om the Ship, we
would take a Sum of Money, and let them go.
He told me, if I would let one of them go on
Shore for the Money, they would do it: So we
adju&s;ted the Value of the Cargo at 30000 Du|cats.
Upon this Agreement we allowed the Sloop
to carry him on Shore at <HI>Dofar</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> where
a rich Merchant laid down the Money for them,
and came off with our Sloop; and on Payment
<PB N="212" REF="230">
of the Money, we very fairly and hone&s;tly let
them go.</P>
<P>Some Days after this, we took an <HI>Arabian</HI> Jonk
going from the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Mocha,</HI> with a
good Quantity of Pearl on board; we gutted
him of the Pearl, which, it &s;eems, was belong|ing
to &s;ome Merchants at <HI>Mocha,</HI> and let him go,
for there was nothing el&s;e worth our taking.</P>
<P>We continued crui&s;ing up and down here, till
we began to find our Provi&s;ions grow low, when
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> our Admiral told us, 'twas time
to think of going back to the Rendezvous, and
the re&s;t of the Men &s;aid the &s;ame, being a little
weary of beating about for above three Months
together, and meeting with little or nothing com|par'd
to our great Expectations. But I was very
loath to part with the Red Sea at &s;o cheap a Rate,
and pre&s;s'd them to tarry a little longer, which
at my In&s;tance we did; but three Days after|wards,
to our great Misfortune, under&s;tood, that
by Landing the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Merchants at <HI>Dofar,</HI> we
had alarmed the Coa&s;t as far as the Gulph of
<HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;o that no Ve&s;&s;el would &s;tir that Way, and
con&s;equently nothing was to be expected on that
Side.</P>
<P>I was greatly mortify'd at this News, and
could no longer with&s;tand the Importunities of
the Men, to return to <HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI> However, as
the Winds continued &s;till to blow at S.S.E. to
E. by S. we were obliged to &s;tand away towards
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the <HI>Cape Guarde Foy,</HI> the
Winds being more variable under the Shore, than
in the open Sea.</P>
<P>Here we chopp'd upon a Booty which we did
not look for, and which made Amends for all our
Waiting; for the very &s;ame Hour that we made
<PB N="213" REF="231">
Land, we &s;py'd a large Ve&s;&s;el &s;ailing along the
Shore, to the Southward. The Ship was of <HI>Bengal,</HI>
belonging to the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Country, but had
on board a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pilot, who&s;e Name, if I remem|ber
right, was <HI>Vanderdie&s;t,</HI> and &s;everal <HI>European</HI>
Seamen, whereof three were <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> She was in
no Condition to re&s;i&s;t us; the re&s;t of her Seamen
were <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Subjects, &s;ome <HI>Mala|bars,</HI>
and &s;ome others. There were five <HI>Indian</HI>
Merchants on board, and &s;ome <HI>Armenian:</HI> It &s;eems
they had been at <HI>Mocha</HI> with Spices, Silks, Dia|monds,
Pearls, Callicoe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch Goods as the
Country afforded, and had little on board now
but Money in Pieces of Eight, which, by the
Way, was ju&s;t what we wanted; and the three
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen came along with us, and the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Pilot would have done &s;o too; but the two <HI>Arme|nian</HI>
Merchants entreated us not to take him;
for that he being their Pilot, there was none of
the Men knew how to guide the Ship: So, at
their Reque&s;t, we refu&s;ed him; but we made
them promi&s;e he &s;hould not be u&s;ed ill for be|ing
willing to go with us.</P>
<P>We got near 200000 Pieces of Eight in this
Ve&s;&s;el; and if they &s;aid true, there was a <HI>Jew</HI> of
<HI>Goa</HI> who intended to have embark'd with them,
who had 200000 Pieces of Eight with him, all
his own; but his good Fortune &s;pringing out of
his ill Fortune, hinder'd him, for he fell &s;ick at
<HI>Mocha,</HI> and could not be ready to travel, which
was the Saving of his Money.</P>
<P>There was none with me at the Taking this
Prize, but the Sloop; for Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI>'s Ship
proving leaky, he went away for the Rendezvous
before us, and arrived there the Middle of <HI>Decem|ber;</HI>
but not liking the Port, he left a great Cro&s;s
<PB N="214" REF="232">
on Shore, with Directions written on a Plate of
Lead fixt to it, for us to come after him to the
great Bay of <HI>Mangahelly,</HI> where he found a ve|ry
good Harbour; but we learnt a Piece of News
here, that kept us from him a great while, which
the Admiral took Offence at; but we &s;topt his
Mouth with his Share of 200000 Pieces of Eight
to him and his Ship's Crew. But the Story which
interrupted our coming to him was this. Between
<HI>Mangahelly</HI> and another Point called <HI>Cape St. Seba|&s;tian,</HI>
there came on Shore in the Night, an
<HI>European</HI> Ship; and whether by Stre&s;s of Wea|ther,
or Want of a Pilot, I know not, but the
Ship &s;tranded, and could not be got off.</P>
<P>We lay in the Cove, or Harbour, where, as
I have &s;aid, our Rendezvous was appointed, and
had not yet been on Shore, &s;o we had not &s;een
the Directions our Admiral had left for us.</P>
<P>Our Friend <HI>William,</HI> of whom I have &s;aid no|thing
a great while, had a great Mind one Day
to go on Shore, and importuned me to let him
have a little Troop to go with him, for Safety,
that they might &s;ee the Country. I was mighti|ly
again&s;t it for many Rea&s;ons; but particularly
I told him, he knew the Natives were but Sava|ges,
and they were very treacherous, and I de&s;i|red
him that he would not go; and had he gone
on much farther, I believe I &s;hould have down|right
refu&s;ed him, and commanded him not to
go.</P>
<P>But in order to per&s;wade me to let him go,
he told me, he would give me an Account of the
Rea&s;on why he was &s;o importunate. He told
me, the la&s;t Night he had a Dream, which was
&s;o forcible, and made &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion upon
his Mind, that he could not be quiet till he had
<PB N="215" REF="233">
made the Propo&s;al to me to go, and if I refu|&s;ed
him, then he thought his Dream was &s;igni|ficant,
and if not, then his Dream was at an
End.</P>
<P>His Dream was, he &s;aid, that he went on Shore
with 30 Men, of which the Cock&s;wain he &s;aid
was one, upon the I&s;land, and that they found a
Mine of Gold, and enrich'd them all; but this
was not the main thing he &s;aid, but that the
&s;ame Morning he had dreamt &s;o, the Cock&s;wain
came to him ju&s;t then, and told him, that he
dreamt he went on Shore on the I&s;land of <HI>Mada|ga&s;car,</HI>
and that &s;ome Men came to him and
told him, they would &s;hew him where he &s;hould
get a Prize would make them all rich.</P>
<P>The&s;e two things put together began to weigh
with me a little, tho' I was never inclined to
give any Heed to Dreams; but <HI>William</HI>'s Impor|tunity
turn'd me effectually, for I always put
a great deal of Stre&s;s upon his Judgment: So
that in &s;hort, I gave them Leave to go; but I
charged them not to go far off from the Sea Coa&s;t,
that if they were forced down to the Sea-Side
upon any Occa&s;ion, we might perhaps &s;ee them,
and fetch them off with our Boats.</P>
<P>They went away early in the Morning, one and
thirty Men of them in Number, very well arm'd,
and very &s;tout Fellows; they travell'd all the Day,
and at Night made us a Signal that all was well,
from the Top of a Hill, which we had agreed on,
by making a great Fire.</P>
<P>Next Day they march'd down the Hill on the
other Side, inclining towards the Sea-Side, as
they had promi&s;ed, and &s;aw a very plea&s;ant Valley
before them with a River in the Middle of it,
which a little farther below them &s;eemed to be
<PB N="216" REF="234">
big enough to bear &s;mall Ships: They marched
a-pace towards this River, and were &s;urprized
with the Noi&s;e of a Piece going off, which by
the Sound could not be far off; they li&s;tened
long, but could hear no more, &s;o they went
on to the River Side, which was a very fine
fre&s;h Stream, but widened a-pace, and they
kept on by the Banks of it, till almo&s;t at once
it opened or widened into a good large Creek,
or Harbour, about five Miles from the Sea;
and that which was &s;till more &s;urprizing, as
they marched forward, they plainly &s;aw in
the Mouth of the Harbour, or Creek, the Wreck
of a Ship.</P>
<P>The Tide was up, as we call it, that did not
appear very much above the Water, but as they
made downwards, they found it grew bigger,
and bigger, and the Tide &s;oon after ebbing out,
they found it lay dry upon the Sands, and ap|peared
to be the Wreck of a con&s;iderable
Ve&s;&s;el, larger than could be expected in that
Country.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, <HI>William</HI> taking out his Gla&s;s
to look at it more nearly, was &s;urprized with
hearing a Mu&s;quet Shot whi&s;tle by him, and
immediately after that, he heard the Gun, and
&s;aw the Smoke from the other Side; upon which
our Men immediately fired three Mu&s;quets to
di&s;cover, if po&s;&s;ible, what or who they were.
Upon the Noi&s;e of the&s;e Guns, Abundance of Men
came running down to the Shore, from among
&s;ome Trees, and our Men could ea&s;ily perceive
that they were <HI>Europeans,</HI> tho' they knew not of
what Nation: However, our Men halloo'd to
them, as loud as they could, and by and by
they got a long Pole, and &s;et it up, and hung a
<PB N="217" REF="235">
white Shirt upon it for a Flag of Truce. They
on the other Side &s;aw it, by the help of their
Gla&s;&s;es too, and quickly after, our Men &s;ee
a Boat launch off from the Shore, as they
thought, but it was from another Creek it &s;eems,
and immediately they came rowing over the
Creek to our Men, carrying al&s;o a white Flag as
a Token of Truce.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the Surprize of Joy
and Satisfaction that appeared on both Sides, to
&s;ee not only white Men, but <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, in a
Place &s;o remote; but what then mu&s;t it be, when
they came to know one another, and to find that
they were not only Country Men, but Comrades,
and that this was the very Ship that Captain
<HI>Wilmot,</HI> our Admiral, commanded, and who&s;e
Company we had lo&s;t in the Storm at <HI>Tobago,</HI>
after making an Agreement to Rendezvous at
<HI>Madaga&s;car?</HI></P>
<P>They had, it &s;eems, got Intelligence of us, when
they came to the South Part of the I&s;land, and
had been a roving as far as the Gulph of <HI>Bengal,</HI>
when they met Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> with whom they
joined, took &s;everal rich Prizes, and among&s;t the
re&s;t, one Ship with the great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Daughter,
and an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure in Money and Jewels,
and from thence they came about the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Coromandel,</HI> and afterwards that of <HI>Malabar,</HI> into
the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where they al&s;o took
&s;ome Prize, and then de&s;igned for the South Part
of <HI>Madaga&s;car;</HI> but the Winds blowing hard at
S. E. and S. E. by E. they came to the North|ward
of the I&s;le, and being after that &s;eparated
by a furious Tempe&s;t from the N. W. they were
forced into the Mouth of that Creek, where they
lo&s;t their Ship. And they told us al&s;o, that they
<PB N="218" REF="236">
heard that Captain <HI>Avery</HI> him&s;elf had lo&s;t his
Ship al&s;o, not far off.</P>
<P>When they had thus acquainted one another
with their Fortunes, the poor over-joyed Men
were in Ha&s;te to go back to communicate their
Joy to their Comrades; and leaving &s;ome of their
Men with ours, the re&s;t went back; and <HI>William</HI>
was &s;o earne&s;t to &s;ee them, that he and two more
went back with them, and there he came to
their little Camp where they lived. There were
about a hundred and &s;ixty Men of them in all; they
had got their Guns on Shore, and &s;ome Ammu|nition,
but a good deal of their Powder was
&s;poil'd. However they had rai&s;ed a fair Platform,
and mounted twelve Pieces of Cannon upon it,
which was a &s;ufficient Defence to them on
that Side of the Sea; and ju&s;t at the End of
the Platform they had made a Launch, and a
little Yard, and were all hard at Work building
another little Ship, as I may call it, to go to Sea
in, but they put a Stop to this Work upon the
News they had of our being come in.</P>
<P>When our Men went into their Hutts, it was
&s;urprizing indeed to &s;ee the va&s;t Stock of Wealth
they had got, in Gold, and Silver, and Jewels,
which however they told was a Trifle to what
Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> had wherever he was gone.</P>
<P>It was five Days we had waited for our Men,
and no News of them, and indeed, I gave them
over for lo&s;t; but was &s;urprized, after five
Days waiting, to &s;ee a Ship's Boat come rowing
towards us along Shore; what to make of it, I
could not tell, but was at la&s;t better &s;atisfied,
when our Men told me they heard them halloo,
and &s;aw them wave their Caps to us.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="237">
In a little time they came quite up to us, and
I &s;aw Friend <HI>William</HI> &s;tand up in the Boat and
make Signs to us; &s;o they came on Board: But
when I &s;aw there was but fifteen of our one and
thirty Men, I asked him what was become of
their Fellows? <HI>O!</HI> &s;ays William, <HI>they are all very
well, and my Dream is fully made good, and the Cock|&s;wain's
too.</HI></P>
<P>This made me very impatient to know how
the Ca&s;e &s;tood; &s;o he told us the whole Story,
which indeed &s;urprized us all. The next Day
we weighed, and &s;tood away Southerly to join
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> and his Ship at <HI>Mangahelly,</HI> where
we found him, as I &s;aid, a little chagrin at our
Stay; but we pacified him afterwards with tel|ling
him the Hi&s;tory of <HI>William</HI>'s Dream, and the
Con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Camp of our Comrades
was &s;o near <HI>Mangahelly,</HI> that our Admiral, and I,
Friend <HI>William,</HI> and &s;ome of the Men, re&s;olved
to take the Sloop, and go and &s;ee them, and
fetch them all, and their Goods, Bag and
Baggage, on board our Ship, which accor|dingly
we did; and found their Camp, their For|tifications,
the Battery of Guns they had erected,
their Trea&s;ure, and all the Men, ju&s;t as <HI>William</HI>
had related it; &s;o after &s;ome Stay, we took all the
Men into the Sloop, and brought them away
with us.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before we knew what was
become of Captain <HI>Avery;</HI> but after about a
Month, by the Direction of the Men who had
lo&s;t their Ship, we &s;ent the Sloop to crui&s;e along
the Shore, to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, where they
were, and in about a Week's Crui&s;e our Men
found them; and particularly, that they had lo&s;t
their Ship, as well as our Men had lo&s;t theirs,
<PB N="220" REF="238">
and that they were every Way in as bad a Con|dition
as ours.</P>
<P>It was about ten Days before the Sloop re|turned,
and Captain <HI>Avery</HI> with them; and
this was the whole Force that, as I remember,
Captain <HI>Avery</HI> ever had with him; for now
we joined all our Companies together, and it
&s;tood thus: We had two Ships and a Sloop, in
which, we had three Hundred and twenty Men,
but much too few to Man them as they ought
to be, the great <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ship requiring of
her &s;elf near 400 Men to Man her compleatly:
As for our lo&s;t, <HI>but now found</HI> Comrade, her Com|pliment
of Men was 180, or there abouts, and
Captain <HI>Avery</HI> had about three Hundred Men
with him, whereof, he had ten Carpenters with
him, mo&s;t of which were taken aboard the Prize
they had taken; &s;o that, in a Word, all the Force
<HI>Avery</HI> had at <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> in the Year 1699, or
thereabouts, amounted to our three Ships, for
his own was lo&s;t, as you have heard, and never
had any more than about twelve Hundred Men
in all.</P>
<P>It was about a Month after this, that all our
Crews got together, and as <HI>Avery</HI> was un&s;hipt,
we all agreed to bring our own Company into
the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Man of War and the Sloop, and
give Captain <HI>Avery</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Frigate, with all
the Tackles, and Furniture Guns, and Ammuni|tion
for his Crew by them&s;elves; for which they
being full of Wealth, agreed to give us Forty
Thou&s;and Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>It was next con&s;idered, what Cour&s;e we &s;hould
take: Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> to give him his due, pro|po&s;ed
our building a little City here, e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
our &s;elves on Shore, with a good Fortifica|tion,
<PB N="221" REF="239">
and Works proper to defend our &s;elves;
and that, as we had Wealth enough, and could
encrea&s;e it to what Degree we plea&s;ed, we
&s;hould content our &s;elves to retire here, and bid
Defiance to the World. But I &s;oon convinc'd him
that this Place would be no Security to us, if we
pretended to carry on our crui&s;ing Trade: For
that then all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and indeed of
that Part of the World, would be engaged to root
us out. But if we re&s;olved to live there, as in a
Retirement, and plant in the Country, as private
Men, and give over our Trade of Pyrating, then
indeed we might Plant, and &s;ettle our &s;elves
where we plea&s;ed; but then I told him, the
be&s;t Way would be to treat with the Natives,
and buy a Tract of Land of them, farther up the
Country, &s;eated upon &s;ome navigable River, where
Boats might go up and down for Plea&s;ure, but
not Ships to endanger us: That thus Planting the
high Ground with Cattle, &s;uch as Cows and
Goats, of which the Country al&s;o was full, to be
&s;ure we might live here as well as any Men in
the World; and I owned to him, I thought it was
a good Retreat for tho&s;e that were willing to leave
off, and lay down, and yet did not care to venture
home and be hanged; that is to &s;ay, to run the
Ri&s;que of it.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> however he made no po&s;itive
Di&s;covery of his Intentions, &s;eemed to me to de|cline
my Notion of going up into the Country
to Plant; on the contrary, it was apparent he was
of Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI>'s Opinion, that they might
maintain them&s;elves on Shore, and yet carry on
their crui&s;ing Trade too; and upon this they
re&s;olved: But as I afterwards under&s;tood, about
fifty of their Men went up the Country, and
<PB N="222" REF="240">
&s;ettled them&s;elves in an Inland Place, as a Co|lony;
whether they are there &s;till or not, I cannot
tell, or how many of them are left alive; but it's
my Opinion, they are there &s;till, and that they
are con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed, for as I hear, they
have got &s;ome Women among them, tho' not
many; for it &s;eems five <HI>Dutch</HI> Women, and three
or four little Girls were taken by them in a
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ship which they afterwards took going to
<HI>Mocha,</HI> and three of tho&s;e Women marrying
&s;ome of the&s;e Men, went with them to live in
their new Plantation; but of this I only &s;peak
by Hear-&s;ay.</P>
<P>As we lay here &s;ome time, I found our Peo|ple
mightily divided in their Notions; &s;ome were
for going this Way, and &s;ome that, till at la&s;t I
began to fore&s;ee they would part Company, and
perhaps we &s;hould not have Men enough to keep
together, to Man the great Ship, &s;o I took Cap|tain
<HI>Wilmot</HI> a&s;ide, and began to talk to him
about it; but &s;oon perceived that he enclined
him&s;elf to &s;tay at <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> and having got a
va&s;t Wealth for his own Share, had &s;ecret De&s;igns
of getting Home &s;ome Way or other.</P>
<P>I argued the Impo&s;&s;ibility of it, and the Hazard
he would run, either of falling into the Hands
of Thieves and Murtherers in the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> who
would never let &s;uch a Trea&s;ure as his was
pa&s;s their Hands, or of his falling into the
Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> who would
certainly hang him for a Pyrate. I gave him an
Account of the Voyage I had made from this
very Place to the Continent of <HI>Africk,</HI> and what
a Journey it was to travel on Foot.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, nothing could per&s;wade him, but he
would go into the <HI>Red Sea</HI> with the Sloop, and
<PB N="223" REF="241">
where the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> pa&s;t through the
Sea dry-&s;hod, and landing there, would travel
to <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> by Land, which is not above
eighty Miles, and from thence he &s;aid he could
Ship him&s;elf by the Way of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> to any
Part of the World.</P>
<P>I repre&s;ented the Hazard, and indeed the Im|po&s;&s;ibility
of his pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Mocha,</HI> and <HI>Judda,</HI>
without being attack'd, if he offered it by Force;
or plundered, if he went to get Leave, and ex|plained
the Rea&s;ons of it &s;o much, and &s;o effectu|ally,
that tho' at la&s;t he would not hearken to
it him&s;elf, none of his Men would go with him.
They told him, they would go any where with
him, to &s;erve him, but that this was running
him&s;elf and them into certain De&s;truction, with|out
any Po&s;&s;ibility of avoiding it, or Probability
of an&s;wering his End. The Captain took what I
&s;aid to him quite wrong, and pretended to re&s;ent
it, and gave me &s;ome Buccanier Words upon it;
but I gave him no Return to it, but this, that I
advi&s;ed him for his Advantage, that if he did
not under&s;tand it &s;o, it was his Fault, not mine;
that I did not forbid him to go, nor had I offered
to per&s;wade any of the Men not to go with him,
tho' it was to their apparent De&s;truction.</P>
<P>However, warm Heads are not ea&s;ily cooled;
the Captain was &s;o eager, that he quitted our
Company, and with mo&s;t Part of his Crew, went
over to Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> and &s;orted with his Peo|ple,
taking all the Trea&s;ure with him, which, by
the Way, was not very fair in him, we having
agreed to &s;hare all our Gains, whether more or
le&s;s, whether ab&s;ent or pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Our Men mutter'd a little at it, but I paci|fied
them as well as I could, and told them, it
<PB N="224" REF="242">
was ea&s;y for us to get as much, if we minded
our Hits; and Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> had &s;et us a very
good Example: For by the &s;ame Rule, the Agree|ment
of any farther Sharing of Profits with them,
was at an End. I took this Occa&s;ion to put into
their Heads, &s;ome Part of my farther De&s;igns,
which were, to range over the Ea&s;tern Sea, and
&s;ee if we could not make our &s;elves as rich as
Mr. <HI>Avery,</HI> who, it was true, had gotten a pro|digious
deal of Money, tho' not one Half of
what was &s;aid of it in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Our Men were &s;o plea&s;ed with my forward,
enterprizing Temper, that they a&s;&s;ured me that
they would go with me, one and all, over the
whole Globe, wherever I would carry them;
and as for Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> they would have
nothing more to do with him. This came to
his Ears, and put him into a great Rage; &s;o
that he threaten'd, if I came on Shore, he would
cut my Throat.</P>
<P>I had Information of it privately, but took no
Notice of it at all, only I took Care not to go
unprovided for him, and &s;eldom walked about
but in very good Company. However, at la&s;t
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> and I met, and talked over the
Matter very &s;eriou&s;ly, and I offered him the Sloop
to go where he plea&s;ed: Or, if he was not &s;atis|fied
with that, I offered to take the Sloop, and
leave him the great Ship. But he declined both,
and only de&s;ired that I would leave him &s;ix Car|penters,
which I had in our Ship, more than I
had need of, to help his Men to fini&s;h the Sloop
that was begun before we came thither, by the
Men that lo&s;t his Ship. This I con&s;ented rea|dily
to, and lent him &s;everal other Hands that
were u&s;eful to them, and in a little time they
<PB N="225" REF="243">
built a &s;tout Brigantine able to carry fourteen
Guns, and two Hundred Men.</P>
<P>What Mea&s;ures they took, and how Captain
<HI>Avery</HI> managed afterwards, is too long a Story
to meddle with here; nor is it any of my Bu|&s;ine&s;s,
having my own Story &s;till upon my Hands.</P>
<P>We lay here about the&s;e &s;everal &s;imple Di&s;|putes
almo&s;t five Months, when about the latter
End of <HI>March</HI> I &s;et Sail with the great Ship,
having in her forty four Guns, and four hundred
Men, and the Sloop, carrying eighty Men. We
did not &s;teer to the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coa&s;t, and &s;o to the
Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as was at fir&s;t intended, the
Ea&s;t Mon&s;oons blowing yet too &s;trong, but we
kept more under the <HI>African</HI> Coa&s;t, where we had
the Wind variable till we pa&s;s'd the Line, and
made the Cape <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> in the Latitude of four De|grees
10 Minutes; from thence, the Mon&s;oons be|ginning
to change to the N. E. and N. N. E. we
led it away, with the Wind large, to the <HI>Mal|divies,</HI>
a famous Ledge of I&s;lands, well known by
all the Sailors who have gone into tho&s;e Parts
of the World; and, leaving the&s;e I&s;lands a little
to the South, we made Cape <HI>Comerin,</HI> the Souther|mo&s;t
Land of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and went
round the I&s;le of <HI>Ceylon.</HI> Here we lay by a while,
to wait for Purcha&s;e; and here we &s;aw three
large <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships going from <HI>Bengal,</HI>
or from Fort St. <HI>George,</HI> home ward for <HI>England,</HI>
or rather for <HI>Bombay</HI> and <HI>Surat,</HI> till the Trade
&s;et in.</P>
<P>We brought to, and hoi&s;ting an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> An|cient
and Pendant, lay by for them, as if we
intended to attack them. They could not tell
what to make of us a good while, though they
&s;aw our Colours; and, I believe, at fir&s;t they
<PB N="226" REF="244">
thought us to be <HI>French;</HI> but as they came nearer
to us, we let them &s;oon &s;ee what we were, for
we hoi&s;ted a black Flag with two cro&s;s Daggers
in it, on our Main Top-ma&s;t Head, which let
them &s;ee what they were to expect.</P>
<P>We &s;oon found the Effect of this; for, at fir&s;t
they &s;pread their Antients, and made up to us
in a Line as if they would fight us, having the
Wind off Shore fair enough, to have brought
them on board us; but when they &s;aw what
Force we were of, and found we were Crui&s;ers
of another kind, they &s;tood away from us again,
with all the Sail they could make. If they had
come up, we &s;hould have given them an unex|pect
Welcome, but as it was, we had no Mind to
follow them, &s;o we let them go for the &s;ame
Rea&s;ons which I mentioned before.</P>
<P>But though we let them pa&s;s, we did not de|&s;ign
to let others go, at &s;o ea&s;y a Price: It was
but the next Morning that we &s;aw a Sail, &s;tand|ing
round Cape <HI>Comeriw,</HI> and &s;teering, as we
thought, the &s;ame Cour&s;e with us. We knew not
at fir&s;t what to do with her, becau&s;e &s;he had
the Shore on her Larboard Quarter, and if we
offered to cha&s;e her, &s;he might put into any Port
or Creek, and e&s;cape us; but to prevent this,
we &s;ent the Sloop, to get in between her and the
Land; as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw that, &s;he haled in to
keep the Land aboard, and when the Sloop &s;tood
towards her, &s;he made right a&s;hore with all the
Canvas &s;he could &s;pread.</P>
<P>The Sloop however came up with her, and
engaged her, and found &s;he was a Ve&s;&s;el of ten
Guns, <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> built, but in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Traders
Hands, and manned by <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> who were bound
from the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> to fetch
<PB N="227" REF="245">
Spices and other Goods from thence. The Sloop's
Men took her, and had the Rummaging of her
before we came up: She had in her &s;ome <HI>European</HI>
Goods, and a good round Sum of Money, and
&s;ome Pearl; &s;o that tho' we did not go to the
Gulph for the Pearl, the Pearl came to us out
of the Gulph, and we had our Share of it. This
was a rich Ship, and the Goods were of very
con&s;iderable Value, be&s;ides the Money and the
Pearl.</P>
<P>We had a long Con&s;ulation here, what we
&s;hould do with the Men; for, to give them the
Ship, and let them pur&s;ue their Voyage to <HI>Java,</HI>
would be to alarm the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory there, who
are by far the &s;tronge&s;t in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and to
make our Pa&s;&s;age that Way impracticable; where|as
we re&s;olved to vi&s;it that Part of the World,
in our Way, but were not willing to pa&s;s the
great Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> where we hoped for a great
deal of Purcha&s;e; and therefore it behoved us not
to be Way-laid before we came there, becau&s;e they
knew we mu&s;t pa&s;s by the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI>
or tho&s;e of <HI>Sundy,</HI> and either Way it was very
ea&s;y to prevent us.</P>
<P><HI>While we were con&s;ulting this in the great
Cabin, the Men had had the &s;ame Debate be|fore
the Ma&s;t, and it &s;eems the Majority there
were for pickling up the poor</HI> Dutchmen <HI>among
the Herrings; in a Word, they were for throw|ing
them all into the Sea. Poor</HI> William <HI>the
Quaker was in great Concern about this, and
comes directly to me, to talk about it.</HI> Hark
thee, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> what wilt thou do with the&s;e
<HI>Dutchmen</HI> thou ha&s;t on board, thou wilt not let them
go I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>&s;ays he?</HI> Why <HI>&s;ays I, William,</HI> would
you advi&s;e me to let them go? No, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> I can|not
<PB N="228" REF="246">
&s;ay it is fit for thee to let them go; that is to &s;ay,
to go on with their Voyage to <HI>Batavia,</HI> becau&s;e it is not
for thy Turn, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Batavia</HI> &s;hould have
any Knowledge of thy being in the&s;e Seas. We&s;t then, <HI>&s;ays
I,</HI> to him, I know no Remedy but to throw them Over-board.
You know <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> a <HI>Dutchman</HI> &s;wims
like a Fi&s;h, and all our People here are of the &s;ame Opini|on
as well as I; at the &s;ame time I re&s;olved it &s;hould not
be done, but wanted to hear what <HI>William</HI> would &s;ay:
But he gravely replyed, if all the Men in the Ship were
of that Mind, I will never believe that thou wilt be of
that Mind thy &s;elf; for I have heard thee prote&s;t a|gain&s;t
Cruelty in all other Ca&s;es. Well <HI>William &s;ays I,</HI>
that is true, but what then &s;hall we do with them?
Why, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> is there no way but to murther
them? I am per&s;waded thou can&s;t not be in earne&s;t; no
indeed <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> I am not in earne&s;t, but
they &s;hall not go <HI>Iava,</HI> no nor to <HI>Ceylon,</HI> that is certain.
But, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> the Men have done thee no Injury
at all, Thou ha&s;t taken a great Trea&s;ure from them,
what can&s;t thou pretend to hurt them for? Nay, <HI>William,
&s;ays I,</HI> do not talk of that, I have Pretence enough if
that be all: My Pretence is to prevent doing me hurt,
and that is as nece&s;&s;ary a Piece of the Law of Self-Pre|&s;ervation as any you can name; but the main Thing is,
I know not what to do with them to prevent their
prating.</P>
<P>While <HI>William</HI> and I was talking, the poo$
<HI>Dutchmen</HI> were openly condemned to die as it
may be called, by the whole Ship's Company; and
&s;o warm were the Men upon it, that they grew
very clamorous; and when they heard that <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
was again&s;t it, &s;ome of them &s;wore they
&s;hould die, and if <HI>William</HI> oppo&s;ed it, he &s;hould
drown along with them.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="247">
But, as I was re&s;olved to put an End
to their cruel Project, &s;o I found itwas time to
take upon me a little, or the bloody Humour
might grow too &s;trong; &s;o I called the <HI>Dutchmen</HI>
up, and talked a little with them. Fir&s;t, I asked
them if they were willing to go with us; two of
them offered it pre&s;ently, but the re&s;t, which
were fourteen, declined it. Well then, &s;aid I,
where would you go? They de&s;ired they &s;hould
go to <HI>Ceylon.</HI> No, I told them, I could not allow
them to go to any <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory, and told them
very plainly the Rea&s;ons of it, which they could
not deny to be ju&s;t. I let them know al&s;o the
cruel bloody Mea&s;ures of our Men, but that I
had re&s;olved to &s;ave them, if po&s;&s;ible, and there|fore
I told them, I would &s;et them on Shore at
&s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> factory in the Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> or put
them on board any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship I met, after I
was pa&s;t the Streights of <HI>Sundy</HI> or of <HI>Malacca,</HI> but
not before; for as to my coming back again, I told
them, I would run the venture of their <HI>Dutch</HI> Power
from <HI>Batavia,</HI> but I would not have the News
come there before me, becau&s;e it would make all
their Merchant Ships lay up, and keep out of
our Way.</P>
<P>It come next into our Con&s;ideration, what we
&s;hould do with their Ship? but this was not long
re&s;olving; for there were but two Ways, either
to &s;et her on Fire, or to run her on Shore, and we
cho&s;e the la&s;t; &s;o we &s;et her Fore-Sail with the
Tack at the Cat-head, and lea&s;ht her Helm a little
to Starboard, to an&s;wer her Head-Sail, and &s;o &s;et
her a-going, with neither Cat or Dog in her, and
it was not above two Hours before we &s;aw her
run right a&s;hore upon the Coa&s;t, a little beyond
<PB N="230" REF="248">
the Cape <HI>Comerin,</HI> and away we went round about
<HI>Ceylon,</HI> for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ailed along there, not in Sight of the Shore,
only, but &s;o near, as to &s;ee the Ships in the Road
at <HI>Fort St. David, Fort St. George,</HI> and at the
other Factories along that Shore, as well as along
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Galconda,</HI> carying our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Anti|ent,
when we came near the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factories,
and <HI>Dutch</HI> Colours when we pa&s;t by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Factories. We met with little Purcha&s;e upon
this Coa&s;t, except two &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Golconda,</HI>
bound cro&s;s the Bay with Bales of Callicoes and
Mu&s;lins, and wrought Silks, and fifteen Bales of
Romalls, from the Bottom of the Bay, which were
going, on who&s;e Account we knew not, to <HI>Achin,</HI>
and to other Ports on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malacca;</HI> we
did not enquire to what Place in particular, but
we let the Ve&s;&s;els go, having none but <HI>Indians</HI> on
board.</P>
<P>In the Bottom of the Bay, we met with a
great <HI>Jonk</HI> belonging to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Court, with
a great many People, Pa&s;&s;engers as we &s;uppo&s;ed
them to be; it &s;eems they were bound for the
River <HI>Hugely,</HI> or <HI>Ganges</HI> and came from <HI>Sumatra;</HI>
this was a Prize worth taking indeed, and we
got &s;o much Gold in her, be&s;ides other Goods
which we did not meddle with, Peper in par|ticular,
that it had like to have put an End to
our Crui&s;e; for almo&s;t all my Men &s;aid we
were rich enough, and de&s;ired to go back again
to <HI>Madaga&s;car;</HI> but I had other things in my
Head &s;till, and when I came to talk to them,
and &s;et Friend <HI>William</HI> to talk with them, we
put &s;uch further Golden Hopes into their Heads,
that we &s;oon prevailed with them to let us
go on.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="249">
My next De&s;ign was, to leave all the dange|rous
Streights of <HI>Malacca, Sincapore,</HI> and <HI>Sundy,</HI>
where we could expect no great Booty, but
what we might light on in <HI>European</HI> Ships,
which we mu&s;t fight for; and tho' we were able to
fight, and wanted no Courage, even to De&s;pera|tion;
yet we were rich too, and re&s;olved to be
richer, and took this for our Maxim: That while
we were &s;ure the Wealth we &s;ought was to be
had without fighting, we had no Occa&s;ion to
put our &s;elves to the Nece&s;&s;ity of fighting for
that which would come upon ea&s;y Terms.</P>
<P>We left therefore the Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> and coming
to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> we put in at a &s;mall
Port, where there was a Town, inhabited only
by <HI>Mallayans,</HI> and here we took in fre&s;h Water,
and a large Quantity of good Pork pickled up,
and well &s;alted, notwith&s;tanding the Heat of
the Climate, being in the very Middle of the
<HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> viz. In three Degrees, fifteen Mi|nutes
North Latitude. We al&s;o took on board
both our Ve&s;&s;els, forty Hogs alive, which &s;er|ved
us for fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, having Abundance of
Food for them &s;uch as the Country produce;
&s;uch as Guams, Potatoes, and a &s;ort of coar&s;e
Rice good for nothing el&s;e, but to feed the
Swine. We killed one of the&s;e Hogs every Day,
and found them to be excellent Meat. We took
in al&s;o a mon&s;trous Quantity of Ducks, and Cocks
and Hens, the &s;ame kind as we have in <HI>England,</HI>
which we kept for Change of Provi&s;ions, and if I
remember right, we had no le&s;s than two Thou|&s;and
of them; &s;o that at fir&s;t we were pe&s;tered
with them very much, but we &s;oon le&s;&s;ened
them by boiling, roa&s;ting, &s;tewing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for we
never wanted while we had them.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="250">
My long projected De&s;ign now lay open to
me, which was, to fall in among&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Spice I&s;lands, and &s;ee what Mi&s;chief I could do
there; accordingly we put out to Sea, the 12th
of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing the Line the 17th, we &s;tood
away due South leaving the Straits of <HI>Sundy,</HI> and
the I&s;le of <HI>Iava</HI> on the Ea&s;t, till we came to the
Latitude of eleven Degrees, twenty Minutes,
when we &s;teered Ea&s;t and E. N. E. having ea&s;y
Gales from the W. S. W. till we came among
the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> or Spice I&s;lands.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e Seas with le&s;s Difficulty than
in other Places, the Winds to the South of <HI>Iava,</HI>
being more variable, and the Weather good, tho'
&s;ometimes we met with Squauly Weather, and
&s;hort Storms; but when we came in among
the Spice I&s;lands them&s;elves, we had a Share of
the Mon&s;oones, or Trade Winds, and made u&s;e
of them accordingly.</P>
<P>The infinite Number of I&s;lands which lye in
the&s;e Seas, embarra&s;t us &s;trangely, and it was with
great Difficulty that we worked our Way thro'
them; then we &s;teered for the North Side of the
<HI>Phillipines,</HI> where we had a double Chance for Pur|cha&s;e,
<HI>viz.</HI> either to meet with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Ships from <HI>Acapulco</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
or we were certain not to fail of finding &s;ome
Ships or Jonks of <HI>China,</HI> who, if they came
from <HI>China,</HI> would have a great Quantity of
Goods of Value on Board, as well as Money;
or if we took them going back, we &s;hould find
them loaden with Nutmegs and Cloves from <HI>Ban|da</HI>
and <HI>Ternate,</HI> or from &s;ome of the other
I&s;lands.</P>
<P>We were right in our Gue&s;&s;es here to a tittle,
and we &s;teered directly through a large Out-let,
<PB N="233" REF="251">
which they call a Streight, tho' it be fifteen Miles
broad, and to an I&s;land they call <HI>Daurma,</HI> and
from thence N. N. E. to <HI>Banda;</HI> between the&s;e
I&s;lands we met with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Jonque, or Ve&s;&s;el
going to <HI>Amboyna.</HI> We took her without much
Trouble, and I had much ado to prevent our
Men murthering all the Men, as &s;oon as they
heard them &s;ay, they belonged to <HI>Amboyna,</HI> the
Rea&s;on I &s;uppo&s;e any one will gue&s;s.</P>
<P>We took out of her about &s;ixteen Ton of Nut|megs,
&s;ome Provi&s;ions, and their &s;mall Arms,
for they had no great Guns, and let the Ship go:
From thence we &s;ailed directly to the <HI>Banda</HI>
I&s;land or I&s;lands, where we were &s;ure to get
more Nutmegs, if we thought fit; for my Part
I would willingly have got more Nutmegs, tho'
I had paid for them, but our People abhorred
paying for any thing; &s;o we got about twelve
Ton more at &s;everal times, mo&s;t of them from
Shore, and only a few in a &s;mall Boat of the Na|tives,
which was going to <HI>Gilolo.</HI> We would have
traded openly, but the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who have made
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all tho&s;e I&s;lands, forbid
the People dealing with us, or any Strangers
whatever, and keep them &s;o in Awe, that they
dur&s;t not do it; &s;o we could indeed have made
nothing of it, if we had &s;tay'd longer, and there|fore
re&s;olved to be gone for <HI>Ternate,</HI> and &s;ee if we
could make up our Loading with Cloves.</P>
<P>Accordingly we &s;tood away North, but found
our &s;elves &s;o intangled among innumerable I&s;lands,
and without any Pilot that under&s;tood the Chan|nel
and Races between them, that we were obli|ged
to give it over, and re&s;olved to go back again
to <HI>Banda,</HI> and &s;ee what we could get among the
other I&s;lands thereabouts.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="252">
The fir&s;t Adventure we made here, had like to
have been fatal to us all, for the Sl$op being a|head,
made the Signal to us for &s;eeing a Sail, and
afterwards another, and a third, by which we
under&s;tood &s;he &s;aw three Sail, whereupon we
made more Sail to come up with her, but on a
&s;udden was gotten among some Rocks, falling
foul upon them in &s;uch a Manner as frighted us
all very heartily; for having it &s;eems but ju&s;t
Water enough as it were to an Inch, our Rudder
&s;truck upon the Top of a Rock, which gave us a
terrible Shock, and &s;plit a great Piece off of the
Rudder, and indeed di&s;abled it &s;o, that our Ship
would not &s;teer at all; at lea&s;t not &s;o as to be de|pended
upon, and we were glad to Hand all our
Sails, except our Fore-&s;ail and Main-top-&s;ail, and
with them we &s;tood away to the Ea&s;t, to &s;ee if we
could find any Creek or Harbour, where we
might lay the Ship on Shore, and repair our Rud|der;
be&s;ides, we found the Ship her &s;elf had re|ceived
&s;ome Damage, for &s;he had &s;ome little Leak
near her Stern Po&s;t, but a great Way under
Water.</P>
<P>By this Mi&s;chance we lo&s;t the Advantages,
whatever they were, of the three Sail of Ships
which we afterward came to hear, were &s;mall
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ships from <HI>Batavia,</HI> going to <HI>Banda</HI> and
<HI>Amboyna,</HI> to load Spice, and no doubt had a good
Quantity of Money on board.</P>
<P>Upon the Di&s;a&s;ter I have been &s;peaking of, you
may very well &s;uppo&s;e that we came to an An|chor
as &s;oon as we could, which was upon a &s;mall
I&s;land not far from <HI>Banda,</HI> where tho' the <HI>Dutch</HI>
keep no Factory, yet they come at the Sea&s;on to
buy Nutmegs and Mace. We &s;tay'd there thir|teen
Days; but there being no Place where we
<PB N="235" REF="253">
could lay the Ship on Shore, we &s;ent the Sloop to
crui&s;e among the I&s;lands, to look out for a Place
fit for us. In the mean time we got very good
Water here, &s;ome Provi&s;ions, Roots, and Fruits,
and a good Quantity of Nutmegs and Mace, which
we found Ways to trade with the Natives for,
without the Knowledge of their Ma&s;ters the
<HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>At length our Sloop return'd, having found an|other
I&s;land where there was a very good Har|bour,
we run in, and came to an Anchor. We
immediately unbent all our Sails, &s;ent them a|&s;hore
upon the I&s;land, and &s;et up &s;even or eight
Tents with them: Then we unrigged our Top|ma&s;ts,
and cut them down, hoi&s;ted all our Guns
out, our Provi&s;ions and Loading, and put them
a&s;hore in the Tents. With the Guns we made
two &s;mall Batteries, for fear of a Surprize, and
kept a Look out upon the Hill. When we were
all ready, we laid the Ship a-ground upon a
hard Sand, the upper End of the Harbour, and
&s;hor'd her up on each Side. At low Water &s;he
lay almo&s;t dry, &s;o we mended her Bottom, and
&s;topt the Leak which was occa&s;ioned by &s;training
&s;ome of the Rudder Irons with the Shock which
the Ship had again&s;t the Rock.</P>
<P>Having done this, we al&s;o took Occa&s;ion to
clean her Bottom, which, having been at Sea &s;o
long, was very foul. The Sloop Wa&s;h'd and Tal|low'd
al&s;o, but was ready before us, and crui&s;ed
eight or ten Days among the I&s;lands, but met
with no Purcha&s;e; &s;o that we began to be tired
of the Place, having little to divert us, but the
mo&s;t furious Claps of Thunder that ever were
read or heard of in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="254">
We were in Hopes to have met with &s;ome Pur|cha&s;e
here among the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> who we had been
told came to <HI>Ternate</HI> to trade for Cloves, and to
the <HI>Banda</HI> I&s;les, for Nutmegs, and we could have
been very glad to have loaded our Galleon, or
great Ship, with the&s;e two Sorts of Spice, and
have thought it a glorious Voyage; but we found
nothing &s;tirring more than what I have &s;aid, ex|cept
<HI>Dutchmen,</HI> who by what Means we could not
imagine, had either a Jealou&s;y of us, or Intelli|gence
of us, and kept them&s;elves clo&s;e in their
Ports.</P>
<P>I was once re&s;olved to have made a De&s;cent at
the I&s;land of <HI>Dumas,</HI> the Place mo&s;t famous for
the be&s;t Nutmegs; but Friend <HI>William,</HI> who was
always for doing our Bu&s;ine&s;s without Fighting,
di&s;&s;waded me from it, and gave &s;uch Rea&s;ons for
it, that we could not re&s;i&s;t; particularly the great
Heats of the Sea&s;on, and of the Place, for we
were now in the Latitude of ju&s;t half a Degree
South; but while we were di&s;puting this Point,
we were &s;oon determined by the following Acci|dent.
We had a &s;trong Gale of Wind at S. W.
by W. and the Ship had fre&s;h Way, but a great
Sea rolling in upon us from the N.E. which we
afterwards found was the Pouring in of the Great
Ocean Ea&s;t of <HI>New Guinea.</HI> However, as I &s;aid,
we &s;tood away large, and made fre&s;h Way, when
on the &s;udden, from a dark Cloud which hover'd
over our Heads, came a Fla&s;h, or rather Bla&s;t of
Lightning, which was &s;o terrible, and quiver'd
&s;o long among us, that not I only, but all our
Men thought the Ship was on Fire. The Heat
of the Fla&s;h or Fire was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly &s;elt in our Fa|ces,
that &s;ome of our Men had Bli&s;ters rai&s;ed by
<PB N="237" REF="255">
it on their Skins, not immediately perhaps by the
Heat, but by the poi&s;onous or noxious Particles,
which mix'd them&s;elves with the Matter in|flam'd.
But this was not all; the Shock of the
Air which the Fracture in the Clouds made, was
&s;uch, that our Ship &s;hook as when a Broad&s;ide is
fired, and her Motion being check'd as it were at
once by a Repul&s;e &s;uperior to the Force that gave
her Way before, the Sails all flew back in a Mo|ment,
and the Ship lay, as we might truly &s;ay,
Thunder-&s;truck. As the Bla&s;t from the Cloud
was &s;o very near us, it was but a few Moments
after the Fla&s;h, that the terrible&s;t Clap of Thun|der
followed that was ever heard by Mortals. I
firmly believe a Bla&s;t of a Hundred Thou&s;and
Barrels of Gunpowder could not have been greater
to our Hearing; nay indeed, to &s;ome of our Men
it took away their Hearing.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe, or any one
to conceive the Terrour of that Minute. Our
Men were in &s;uch a Con&s;ternation, that not a
Man on board the Ship had Pre&s;ence of Mind to
apply to the proper Duty of a Sailor, except
Friend <HI>William;</HI> and had not he run very nimbly,
and with a Compo&s;ure that I am &s;ure I was not
Ma&s;ter of, to let go the Fore-&s;heet, &s;et in the
Weather Brace of the Fore-yard, and haul'd
down the Top&s;ails, we had certainly brought all
our Ma&s;ts by the Board, and perhaps have been
overwhelm'd in the Sea.</P>
<P>As for my &s;elf, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my Eyes were
open to my Danger, tho' not the lea&s;t to any
thing of Application for Remedy. I was all
Amazement and Confu&s;ion, and this was the fir&s;t
Time that I can &s;ay I began to feel the Effects of
<PB N="238" REF="256">
that Horrour which I know &s;ince much more of,
upon the ju&s;t Reflection on my former Life. I
thought my &s;elf doom'd by Heaven to &s;ink that
Moment into eternal De&s;truction; and with this
peculiar Mark of Terror, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Ven|geance
was not executed in the ordinary Way
of human Ju&s;tice, but that God had taken me
into his immediate Di&s;po&s;ing, and had re&s;olved
to be the Executer of his own Vengeance.</P>
<P>Let them alone de&s;cribe the Confu&s;ion I was in,
who know what was the Ca&s;e of&mdash;<HI>Child</HI> of
<HI>Shadwell,</HI> or <HI>Francis Spira.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe.
My Soul was all Amazement and Sur|prize;
I thought my &s;elf ju&s;t &s;inking into Eter|nity,
owning the divine Ju&s;tice of my Puni&s;hment,
but not at all feeling any of the moving, &s;oft|ning
Tokens of a &s;incere Penitent, afflicted at the
Puni&s;hment, but not at the Crime, alarmed at
the Vengeance, but not terrify'd at the Guilt, ha|ving
the &s;ame Gu&s;t to the Crime, tho' terri&s;ied
to the la&s;t Degree at the Thought of the Pu|ni&s;hment,
which I concluded I was ju&s;t now
going to receive.</P>
<P>But perhaps many that read this will be &s;en|&s;ible
of the Thunder and Lightning, that may
think nothing of the re&s;t, or rather may make
a Je&s;t of it all, &s;o I &s;ay no more of it at this
time, but proceed to the Story of the Voyage.
When the Amazement was over, and the Men
began to come to them&s;elves, they fell a calling
for one another, every one for his Friend, or for
tho&s;e he had mo&s;t Re&s;pect for; and it was a &s;ingu|lar
Satisfaction to find that no body was hurt.
The next thing was to enquire if the Ship had
received no Damage, when the Boat&s;wain &s;tep|ping
<PB N="239" REF="257">
forward, found that Part of the Head was
gone, but not &s;o as as to endanger the Bolt|&s;prit;
&s;o we hoi&s;ted our Top&s;ails again, haul'd
aft the Fore-&s;heet, brac'd the Yards, and went
went our Cour&s;e as before: Nor can I deny but
that we were all &s;omewhat like the Ship, our
fir&s;t A&s;toni&s;hment being a little over, and that we
found the Ship &s;wim again, we were &s;oon the
&s;ame irreligious hardned Crew that we were be|fore,
and I among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>As we now &s;teer'd, our Cour&s;e lay N.N.E.
and we pa&s;&s;ed thus with a fair Wind, thro' the
Streight or Channel between the I&s;land of <HI>Gilolo,</HI>
and the Land of <HI>Nova Guinea,</HI> when we were &s;oon
in the open Sea or Ocean, on the South Ea&s;t of
the <HI>Philippines,</HI> being the great Pacifick, or South
Sea, where it may be &s;aid to join it &s;elf with the
va&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed into the&s;e Seas &s;teering due North,
&s;o we &s;oon cro&s;s'd the Line to the North Side,
and &s;o &s;ailed on towards <HI>Mindanoa</HI> and <HI>Manilla,</HI> the
chief of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, without meeting
with any Purcha&s;e, till we came to the North|ward
of <HI>Manilla,</HI> and then our Trade began; for
here we took three <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, tho' at &s;ome
Di&s;tance from <HI>Manilla.</HI> Two of them had made
their Market, and were going Home with Nut|megs,
Cinnamon, Cloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be&s;ides all Sorts
of <HI>European</HI> Goods brought with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships
from <HI>Acapulco.</HI> They had together eight and
thirty Ton of Cloves, and five or &s;ix Ton of
Nutmegs, and as much Cinnamon. We took
the Spice, but meddled with very little of the
<HI>European</HI> Goods, they being, as we thought, not
worth our while, but we were very &s;orry for it
<PB N="240" REF="258">
&s;oon after, and therefore grew wi&s;er upon the
next Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The third <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> was the be&s;t Prize to us, for
he came with Money, and a great deal of Gold
uncoin'd, to buy &s;uch Goods as we mentioned
above: We ea&s;ed him of his Gold, and did
him no other Harm, and having no Intention to
&s;tay long here, we &s;tood away for <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>We were at Sea above two Months upon this
Voyage, beating it up again&s;t the Wind, which
blew &s;teadily from the North Ea&s;t, and within a
Point or two one Way or other; and this indeed
was the Rea&s;on why we met with the more Pri|zes
in our Voyage.</P>
<P>We were ju&s;t gotten clear of the <HI>Philippines,</HI> and
as we purpo&s;ed to go the I&s;le of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> when
the Wind blew &s;o fre&s;h at N. N. E. that there
was no making any thing of it, and we were
forced to put back to <HI>Laconia,</HI> the mo&s;t Norther|ly
of tho&s;e I&s;lands. We rode here very &s;ecure,
and &s;hifted our Situation not in View of any Dan|ger,
for there was none, but for a better Supply
of Provi&s;ions, which we found the People very
willing to &s;upply us with.</P>
<P>There lay while we remained here, three ve|ry
great Galleons or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships, from the South
Seas, whether newly come in, or ready to &s;ail, we
could not under&s;tand at fir&s;t; but as we found
the <HI>China</HI> Traders began to load and &s;et forward
to the North, we concluded the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships had
newly unloaded their Cargo, and the&s;e had been
buying; &s;o we doubted not but we &s;hould meet
with Purcha&s;e in the re&s;t of our Voyage, neither
indeed could we well mi&s;s of it.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd here till the beginning of <HI>May,</HI>
when we were told the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Traders would
<PB N="241" REF="259">
&s;et forward, for the Northern Mon&s;oons end
about the latter End of <HI>March,</HI> or the Beginning
of <HI>April;</HI> &s;o that they are &s;ure of fair Winds
Home. Accordingly we hired &s;ome of the Coun|try
Boats, which are very &s;wift Sailers, to go
and bring us Word how Affairs &s;tood at <HI>Manil|la,</HI>
and when the <HI>China</HI> Jonks would &s;ail, and by
this Intelligence we ordered our Matters &s;o well,
that three Days after we &s;et Sail, we fell in with
no le&s;s than eleven of them, out of which how|ever
having by Misfortune of di&s;covering our
&s;elves, taken but three, we contented our &s;elves,
and pur&s;ued our Voyage to <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI> In the&s;e
three Ve&s;&s;els we took in &s;hort &s;uch a Quantity of
Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamon, and Mace, be&s;ides
Silver, that our Men began to be of my Opinion,
<HI>That we were rich enough;</HI> and in &s;hort, we had
nothing to do now, but to con&s;ider by what Me|thods
to &s;ecure the immen&s;e Trea&s;ure we had
got.</P>
<P>I was &s;ecretly glad to hear, that they were of
this Opinion; for I had long before re&s;olved, if
it was po&s;&s;ible, to per&s;wade them to think of re|turning,
having fully perfected my fir&s;t projected
De&s;ign, of Rummaging among the Spice I&s;lands,
and all tho&s;e Prizes, which were exceeding rich
at <HI>Manilla,</HI> was quite beyond my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>But now I had heard what the Men &s;aid, and how
they thought we were very well. I let them know
by Friend <HI>William,</HI> that I intended only to &s;ail to
the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> where I &s;hould find Opportu|nity
to turn our Spices and <HI>European</HI> Goods into
ready Money, and that then I would tack about
for the South, the Northern Mon&s;oons being per|haps
by that time al&s;o ready to &s;et in. They all
approved of my De&s;ign, and willingly went for|ward,
<PB N="242" REF="260">
becau&s;e, be&s;ides the Winds, which would
not permit until <HI>October,</HI> to go to the South: I
&s;ay, be&s;ides this, we were now a very deep Ship,
having near two Hundred Ton of Goods on board,
and particularly &s;ome very valuable. The Sloop
al&s;o had a Proportion.</P>
<P>With this Re&s;olution we went on chearfully,
when within about twelve Days Sail more, we
made the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> at a great Di&s;tance, but
were our &s;elves &s;hot beyond the Southermo&s;t
Part of the I&s;land, being to Leeward, and almo&s;t
upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>China.</HI> Here we were a little
at a Lo&s;s; for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factories were not far
off, and we might be obliged to fight &s;ome of
their Ships, if we met with them; which tho'
we were able enough to do, yet we did not
de&s;ire it on many Accounts; and particularly
becau&s;e we did not think it was our Bu&s;ine&s;s to
have it known who we were, or that &s;uch a kind
of People as we had been &s;een on the Coa&s;t.
However, we were obliged to keep up to the
Northward, keeping as good an Offing as we could,
with re&s;pect to the Coa&s;t of <HI>China.</HI> We had not
&s;ailed long, but we cha&s;ed a &s;mall <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Jonk;
and having taken her, we found &s;he was bound
to the I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> having no Goods on
board but &s;ome Rice, and a &s;mall Quantity of
Tea; but &s;he had three <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Merchants in her,
and they told us they were going to meet a
large Ve&s;&s;el of their Country, which came from
<HI>Tonquin,</HI> and lay in a River in <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> who&s;e Name
I forget, and they were going to the <HI>Philippine</HI>
I&s;lands, with Silks, Mu&s;lins, Callicoes, and &s;uch
Goods as are the Product of <HI>China,</HI> and &s;ome Gold;
that their Bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;ell their Cargo, and
buy Spices and <HI>European</HI> Goods.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="261">
This &s;uited very well with our Purpo&s;e; &s;o I
re&s;olved now that we would leave off being Py|rates,
and turn Merchants; &s;o we told them
what Goods we had on board, and that if they
would bring their Super-Cargoes or Merchants
on board, we would trade with them. They
were very willing to trade with us, but terribly
afraid to tru&s;t us; nor was it an unju&s;t Fear,
for we had plundered them already of what they
had. On the other Hand, we were as diffident
as they, and very uncertain what to do; but
<HI>William</HI> the Quaker put this Matter into a Way
of Barter. He came to me, and told me he re|ally
thought the Merchants look'd like fair Men,
that meant hone&s;tly; and be&s;ides, &s;ays <HI>William,</HI>
it is their Intere&s;t to be hone&s;t now; for as they
know upon what Terms we got the Goods we
are to truck with them, &s;o they know we can
afford good Pennyworths; and in the next Place,
it &s;aves them going the whole Voyage: So that
the Southerly Mon&s;oons yet holding, if they
traded with us, they could immediately return
with their Cargo to <HI>China, tho' by the Way we af|terwards
found they intended for</HI> Japan. But that
was all one, for by this Means they &s;av'd at
lea&s;t eight Months Voyage. Upon the&s;e Foun|dations
<HI>William</HI> &s;aid he was &s;atisfied we might
tru&s;t them: For, &s;ays <HI>William,</HI> I would as &s;oon
tru&s;t a Man who&s;e Intere&s;t binds him to be ju&s;t
to me, as a Man who&s;e Principle binds him&s;elf.
Upon the whole, <HI>William</HI> propo&s;ed that two of
the Merchants &s;hould be left on board our Ship
as Ho&s;tages, and that Part of our Goods &s;hould
be loaded in their Ve&s;&s;el, and let the third go
with it into the Port where their Ship lay; and
when he had delivered the Spices, he &s;hould
<PB N="244" REF="262">
bring back &s;uch things as it was agreed &s;hould be
exchanged. This was concluded on, and <HI>William</HI>
the Quaker ventured to go along with them, which
upon my Word I &s;hould not have cared to have
done, nor was I willing that he &s;hould; but he
went &s;till upon the Notion, that it was their In|tere&s;t
to treat him friendly.</P>
<P>In the mean time we came to an Anchor un|der
a little I&s;land, in the Latitude of 23 Degrees,
28 Minutes, being ju&s;t under the Northern Tro|pick,
and about twenty Leagues from the I&s;land.
Here we lay thirteen Days, and I began to be ve|ry
unea&s;y for my Friend <HI>William,</HI> for they had
promi&s;ed to be back again in four Days, which
they might very ea&s;ily have done. However, at
the End of thirteen Days we &s;aw three Sail coming
directly to us, which a little &s;urprized us all at
fir&s;t, not knowing what might be the Ca&s;e, and
we began to put our &s;elves in a Po&s;ture of De|fence;
but as they came nearer us, we were &s;oon
&s;atisfy'd: For the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el was that which <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
went in, who carried a Flag of Truce,
and in a few Hours they all came to an Anchor,
and <HI>William</HI> came on board us with a little Boat,
with the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Merchant in his Company, and
two other Merchants, which &s;eem'd to be a kind
of Brokers for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Here he gave us an Account, how civilly he
had been u&s;ed, how they had treated him with
all imaginable Frankne&s;s and Openne&s;s, that they
had not only given him the full Value of his
Spices and other Goods which he carry'd, in Gold,
by good Weight, but had loaded the Ve&s;&s;el again
with &s;uch Goods as he knew we were willing to
trade for; and that afterwards they had re&s;olved
to bring the great Ship out of the Harbour, to
<PB N="245" REF="263">
lye where we were, that &s;o we might make what
Bargain we thought fit; only <HI>William</HI> &s;aid he had
promi&s;ed in our Name, that we &s;hould u&s;e no
Violence with them, nor detain any of the Ve&s;|&s;els
after we had done trading with them. I told
him, we would &s;trive to outdo them in Civility,
and that we would make good every Part of his
Agreement. In Token whereof I cau&s;ed a white
Flag likewi&s;e to be &s;pread at the Poop of our
great Ship, which was the Signal agreed on.</P>
<P>As to the third Ve&s;&s;el which came with them,
it was a kind of Bark of the Country, who
having Intelligence of our De&s;ign to traffick,
came off to deal with us, bringing a great deal
of Gold, and &s;ome Provi&s;ions, which at that time
we were very glad of.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we traded upon the high Seas with
the&s;e Men, and indeed we made a very good Mar|ket,
and yet &s;old Thieves Pennyworths too. We
&s;old here above &s;ixty Ton of Spice, chiefly Cloves
and Nutmegs, and above two Hundred Bales of
<HI>European</HI> Goods; &s;uch as Linnen and Wollen Ma|nufactures.
We con&s;idered we &s;hould have Occa|&s;ion
for &s;ome &s;uch things our &s;elves, and &s;o we
kept a good Quantity of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stuffs, Cloaths,
Bays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for our &s;elves. I &s;hall not take up
any of the little Room I have left here, with the
further Particulars of our Trade; 'tis enough to
mention, that except a Parcel of Tea, and twelve
Bales of fine <HI>China</HI> wrought Silks, we took nothing
in Exchange for our Goods but Gold: So that the
Sum we took here in that glittering Commodity,
amounted to above Fifty Thou&s;and Ounces good
Weight.</P>
<P>When we had fini&s;hed our Barter, we re&s;tored
the Ho&s;tages, and gave the three Merchants about
<PB N="246" REF="264">
the Quantity of Twelve Hundred Weight of
Nutmegs, and as many of Cloves, with a hand|&s;om
Pre&s;ent of <HI>European</HI> Linnen and Stuff for them|&s;elves,
as a Recompence for what we had taken
from them; and &s;o we &s;ent them away exceeding|ly
well &s;atisfy'd.</P>
<P>Here it was that <HI>William</HI> gave me an Account,
that while he was on board the <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, he
met with a kind of Religious, or <HI>Japan</HI> Prie&s;t,
who &s;poke &s;ome Words of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to him; and
being very inqui&s;itive to know how he came to
learn any of tho&s;e Words, he told him, that there
was in his Country <HI>thirteen Engli&s;hmen;</HI> he called
them <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> very articulately and di&s;tinctly,
for he had conver&s;ed with them very frequently
and freely: He &s;aid they were all that were left
of two and thirty Men, who came on Shore on the
North Side of <HI>Japan,</HI> being driven upon a great
Rock in a &s;tormy Night, where they lo&s;t their
Ship, and the re&s;t of their Men were drowned:
That he had per&s;waded the King of his Country
to &s;end Boats off to the Rock or I&s;land, where
the Ship was lo&s;t, to &s;ave the re&s;t of the Men,
and to bring them on Shore; which was done,
and they were u&s;ed very kindly; and had Hou&s;es
built for them, and Land given them to plant for
Provi&s;ion, and that they lived by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he went frequently among them, to
per&s;wade them to wor&s;hip their God, an Idol, I
&s;uppo&s;e, of their own making, which he &s;aid
they ungratefully refu&s;ed; and that therefore the
King had once or twice ordered them to be all put
to Death; but that, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> he had prevailed
upon the King to &s;pare them, and let them live
their own Way, as long as they were quiet and
<PB N="247" REF="265">
peaceable, and did not go about to withdraw
others from the Wor&s;hip of the Country.</P>
<P>I ask'd <HI>William,</HI> why he did not enquire from
whence they came? I did, <HI>&s;aid William,</HI> for how
could I but think it &s;trange, &s;aid he, to hear him
talk of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men on the North Side of <HI>Japan.</HI>
Well, &s;aid I, what Account did he give of it?
An Account, &s;aid <HI>William,</HI> that will &s;uprize thee,
and all the World after thee, that &s;hall hear of it,
and which makes me wi&s;h thou would&s;t go up to
<HI>Japan,</HI> and find them out. What do ye mean,
&s;aid I? Whence could they come? Why, &s;ays
<HI>William,</HI> he pull'd out a little Book, and in it a
Piece of Paper, where it was written in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Man's Hand, and in plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Words, thus;
and &s;ays <HI>William,</HI> I read it my &s;elf: <HI>We came from
Greenland,</HI> and from the <HI>North Pole.</HI> This indeed
was amazing to us all, and more to tho&s;e Sea|men
among us who knew any thing of the in|finite
Attempts which had been made from <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
as well by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to di&s;co|ver
a Pa&s;&s;age that Way into tho&s;e Parts of the
World; and as <HI>William</HI> pre&s;s'd us earne&s;tly to go
on to the North, to re&s;cue tho&s;e poor Men, &s;o
the Ship's Company began to incline to it; and
in a Word, we all came to this, that we would
&s;tand in to the Shore of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> to find this
Prie&s;t again, and have a farther Account of it
all from him. Accordingly the Sloop went over,
but when they came there, the Ve&s;&s;els were very
unhappily &s;ail'd, and this put an End to our En|quiry
after them, and perhaps may have di&s;ap|pointed
Mankind of one of the mo&s;t noble Di&s;|coveries
that ever was made, or will again be made
in the World, for the Good of Mankind in gene|ral:
But &s;o much for that.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="266">
<HI>William</HI> was &s;o unea&s;y at lo&s;ing this Oppor|tunity,
that he pre&s;s'd us earne&s;tly to go up to
<HI>Japan,</HI> to find out the&s;e Men. He told us, that
if it was nothing but to recover Thirteen ho|ne&s;t
poor Men from a kind of Captivity, which
they would otherwi&s;e never be redeemed from,
and where perhaps they might &s;ome time or other
be murdered by the barbarous People, in Defence
of their Idolatry; it were very well worth our
while, and it would be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure making
amends for the Mi&s;chiefs we had done in the
World: But we that had no Concern upon us
for the Mi&s;chiefs we had done, had much le&s;s
about any Satisfaction to be made for it; &s;o he
found that kind of Di&s;cour&s;e would weigh very
little with us. Then he pre&s;s'd us very earne&s;t|ly
to let him have the Sloop to go by him&s;elf,
and I told him I would not oppo&s;e it; but when
he came to the Sloop, none of the Men would
go with him; for the Ca&s;e was plain, they had
all a Share in the Cargo of the great Ship, as
well as in that of the Sloop, and the Richne&s;s
of the Cargo was &s;uch, that they would not leave
it by any means: So poor <HI>William,</HI> much to his
Mortification, was obliged to give it over. What
became of tho&s;e thirteen Men, or whether they
are not there &s;till, I can give no Account of.</P>
<P>We were now at the End of our Crui&s;e; what
we had taken was indeed &s;o con&s;iderable, that it
was not only enough to &s;atisfy the mo&s;t covetous
and the mo&s;t ambitious Minds in the World, but
it did indeed &s;atisfy us; and our Men declared
they did not de&s;ire any more. The next Motion
therefore was about going back, and the Way by
which we &s;hould perform the Voyage, &s;o as not
to be attack'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the Straits of <HI>Sundy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="267">
We had pretty well &s;tored our &s;elves here with
Provi&s;ions, and it being now near the Return
of the Mon&s;oons, we re&s;olved to &s;tand away to
the Southward; and not only to keep without
the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, that is to &s;ay, to the Ea&s;t|ward
of them, but to keep on to the Southward,
and &s;ee if we could not leave, not only the <HI>Mo|lucco's,</HI>
or Spice I&s;lands, behind us, but even <HI>Nova
Guinea</HI> and <HI>Nova Hollandia</HI> al&s;o; and &s;o getting
into the variable Winds, to the South of the
Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> &s;teer away to the We&s;t,
over the great <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean.</P>
<P>This was indeed at fir&s;t a mon&s;trous Voyage
in its Appearance, and the Want of Provi&s;ions
threaten'd us. <HI>William</HI> told us in &s;o many Words,
that it was impo&s;&s;ible we could carry Provi&s;ions
enough to &s;ub&s;i&s;t us for &s;uch a Voyage, and e&s;pe|cially
fre&s;h Water; and that as there would be
no Land for us to touch at, where we could get
any Supply, it was a Madne&s;s to undertake it.</P>
<P>But I undertook to remedy this Evil, and
therefore de&s;ired them not to be unea&s;y at that,
for I knew we might &s;upply our &s;elves at <HI>Min|danao,</HI>
the mo&s;t Southerly I&s;land of the <HI>Philip|pines.</HI>
Accordingly, we &s;et Sail, having taken
all the Provi&s;ions here that we could get, the
28th of <HI>September,</HI> the Wind veering a little at
fir&s;t from the N. N. W. to the N. E. by E. but
afterwards &s;ettled about the N. E. and the E. N. E.
We were nine Weeks in this Voyage, having met
with &s;everal Interruptions by the Weather, and
put in under the Lee of a &s;mall I&s;land in the La|titude
of 16 Degrees, 12 Minutes, of which we
never knew the Name, none of our Charts ha|ving
given any Account of it: I &s;ay, we put in
here, by rea&s;on of a &s;trange <HI>Tornado</HI> or Hurricane,
<PB N="250" REF="268">
which brought us into a great deal of Danger.
Here we rode about &s;ixteen Days, the Winds
being very tempe&s;tuous, and the Weather un|certain.
However, we got &s;ome Provi&s;ions on
Shore, &s;uch as Plants and Roots, and a few Hoggs.
We believed there were Inhabitants on the I&s;land,
but we &s;aw none of them.</P>
<P>From hence, the Weather &s;ettling again, we
went on, and came to the Southmo&s;t Part of <HI>Min|danao,</HI>
where we took in fre&s;h Water, and &s;ome
Cows; but the Climate was &s;o hot, that we did
not attempt to &s;alt up any more, than &s;o as to
keep a Fortnight or three Weeks, and away
we &s;tood South ward cro&s;&s;ing the Line, and
leaving <HI>Gillolo</HI> on the Starboard Side, we coa&s;ted
the Country they call <HI>New Guiney,</HI> where, in the
Latitude of eight Degrees South, we put in again
for Provi&s;ions and Water, and where we found
Inhabitants, but they fled from us, and were alto|gether
inconver&s;able. From thence, &s;ailing &s;till
Southward, we left all behind us that any of
our Charts or Maps take any Notice of, and went
on till we came to the Latitude of 17 Degrees,
the Wind continuing &s;till N. E.</P>
<P>Here we made Land to the We&s;tward, which
when we had kept in Sight for three Days, coa&s;t|ing
along the Shore, for the Di&s;tance of about
four Leagues, we began to fear we &s;hould find
no Outlet We&s;t, and &s;o &s;hould be obliged to go
back again, and put in among the <HI>Molucco's</HI> at
la&s;t; but at length we found the Land break
off, and go trending away to the We&s;t Sea, &s;eem|ing
to be all open to the South and S. W. and
a great Sea came rowling out of the South, which
gave us to under&s;tand, that there was no Land
that Way for a great Way.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="269">
In a Word, we kept on our Cour&s;e to the South,
a little We&s;terly, till we pa&s;s'd the South Tro|pick,
where we found the Winds variable; and
now we &s;tood away fair We&s;t, and held it out
for about twenty Days, when we di&s;covered Land
right a-head, and on our Larboard Bow, we made
directly to the Shore, being willing to take all Ad|vantages
now for &s;upplying our &s;elves with fre&s;h
Provi&s;ions and Water, knowing we were now en|tring
on that va&s;t unknown <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, per|haps
the greate&s;t Sea on the Globe, having with
very little Interruption of I&s;lands, a continued
Sea quite round the Globe.</P>
<P>We found a good Road here, and &s;ome Peo|ple
on Shore; but when we landed, they fled
up the Country, nor would they hold any Cor|re&s;pondence
with us, or come near us, but &s;hot
at us &s;everal Times with Arrows as long as Laun|ces.
We &s;et up white Flags for a Truce, but
they either did not, or would not, under&s;tand it:
On the contrary, they &s;hot our Flag of Truce
thro' &s;everal times with their Arrows; &s;o that, in
a Word, we never came near any of them.</P>
<P>We found good Water here, tho' it was &s;ome|thing
difficult to get at it, but for living Crea|tures
we could &s;ee none; for the People, if they
had any Cattle, drove them all away, and &s;hew'd
us nothing but them&s;elves, and that &s;ometimes
in a threatning Po&s;ture, and in Number &s;o great,
that made us &s;uppo&s;e the I&s;land to be greater than
we at fir&s;t imagined. It is true, they would not
come near enough for us to engage with them,
at lea&s;t, not openly; but they came near enough
for us to &s;ee them, and by the Help of our
Gla&s;&s;es, to &s;ee that they were clothed and arm'd,
but their Clothes were only about their lower
<PB N="252" REF="270">
and middle Parts; that they had long Launces,
like Half Pikes, in their Hands, be&s;ides Bows and
Arrows; that they had great high Things on
their Heads, made, as we believed, of Feathers,
and which look'd &s;omething like our Grenadi|ers
Caps in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When we &s;aw them &s;o &s;hye, that they would
not come near us, our Men began to range over
the I&s;land, <HI>if it was &s;uch, for we never &s;urrounded
it,</HI> to &s;earch for Cattel, and for any of the <HI>In|dians</HI>
Plantations, for Fruits or Plants; but they
&s;oon found, to their Co&s;t, that they were to u&s;e
more Caution than that came to, and that they
were to di&s;cover perfectly every Bu&s;h and every
Tree, before they ventured abroad in the Coun|try;
for, about fourteen of our Men going fur|ther
than the re&s;t, into a Part of the Country
which &s;eemed to be planted, as they thought,
for it did but &s;eem &s;o, only I think it was over|grown
with Canes, &s;uch as we make our Cane
Chairs with: I &s;ay, venturing too far, they were
&s;uddenly attack'd with a Shower of Arrows from
almo&s;t every Side of them, as they thought,
out of the Tops of the Trees.</P>
<P>They had nothing to do, but to fly for it,
which however they could not re&s;olve on, till
five of them were wounded; nor had they e&s;ca|ped
&s;o, if one of them had not been &s;o much
wi&s;er, or thoughtfuller than the re&s;t, as to con|&s;ider,
that tho' they could not &s;ee the Enemy,
&s;o as to &s;hoot at them, yet perhaps the Noi&s;e
of their Shot might terrify them, and that they
&s;hould rather fire at a Venture. Accordingly
Ten of them faced about, and fired at random
any where among the Canes.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="271">
The Noi&s;e and the Fire not only terrify'd
the Enemy, but, as they believed, their Shot had
luckily hit &s;ome of them; for they found not on|ly
that the Arrows which came thick among
them before, cea&s;ed, but they heard the <HI>Indians</HI>
halloo, after their Way, to one another, and make
a &s;trange Noi&s;e more uncouth and inimi$ably
&s;trange, than any they had ever heard, more like
the Howling and Barking of wild Creatures in
the Woods, than like the Voice of Men, only
that &s;ometimes they &s;eemed to &s;peak Words.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erv'd al&s;o, that this Noi&s;e of the <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
went farther and farther off, &s;o that they were
&s;atisfied the <HI>Indians</HI> fled away, except on one Side,
where they heard a doleful Groaning and Howl|ing,
and where it continued a good while, which
they &s;uppo&s;ed was from &s;ome or other of them
being wounded, and howling by rea&s;on of their
Wounds; or kill'd, and others howling over
them: But our Men had enough of making Di&s;|coveries;
&s;o they did not trouble them&s;elves to
look farther, but re&s;olved to take this Opportuni|ty
to retreat. But the wor&s;t of their Adventure
was to come; for as they came back, they pa&s;s'd
by a prodigious great Trunk of an old Tree,
what Tree it was they &s;aid they did not know, but
it &s;tood like an old decay'd Oak in a Park, where
the Keepers in <HI>England</HI> take <HI>a Stand,</HI> as they call
it, to &s;hoot a Deer, and it &s;tood ju&s;t under the
&s;teep Side of a great Rock or Hill, that our Peo|ple
could not &s;ee what was beyond it.</P>
<P>As they came by this Tree, they were of a &s;ud|den
&s;hot at from the Top of the Tree, with &s;even
Arrows and three Launces, which, to our great
Grief, kill'd two of our Men, and wounded three
more. This was the more &s;urprizing, becau&s;e
<PB N="254" REF="272">
being without any Defence, and &s;o near the Trees,
they expected more Launces and Arrows every
Moment; nor would flying do them any Service,
the <HI>Indians</HI> being, as appeared, very good Mark&s;|men.
In this Extremity they had happily this
Pre&s;ence of Mind, <HI>viz.</HI> to run clo&s;e to the Tree,
and &s;tand, as it were under it; &s;o that tho&s;e
above could not come at, or &s;ee them, to throw
their Launces at them. This &s;ucceeded, and gave
them Time to con&s;ider what to do: They knew
their Enemies and Murtherers were above, for
they heard them talk, and tho&s;e above knew
tho&s;e were below; but they below were obli|ged
to keep clo&s;e for fear of their Launces from
above. At length, one of our Men looking a
little more &s;trictly than the re&s;t, thought he
&s;aw the Head of one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> ju&s;t over a
dead Limb of the Tree, which, it &s;eems, the
Creature &s;at upon. One Man immediately fired,
and levell'd his Piece &s;o true, that the Shot went
thro' the Fellow's Head, and down he fell out of
the Tree immediately, and came upon the Ground
with &s;uch Force, with the Height of his Fall,
that if he had not been killed with the Shot,
he would certainly have been killed with da&s;hing
his Body again&s;t the Ground.</P>
<P>This &s;o frighted them&s;elves, that be&s;ides the
howling Noi&s;e they made in the Tree, our Men
heard a &s;trange Clutter of them in the Body of
the Tree, from whence they concluded they had
made the Tree hollow, and were got to hide
them&s;elves there. Now, had this been the Ca&s;e,
they were &s;ecure enough from our Men; for it
was impo&s;&s;ible any of our Men could get up the
Tree on the Out-&s;ide, there being no Branches
to climb by; and, to &s;hoot at the Tree, that
<PB N="255" REF="273">
they tried &s;everal times to no Purpo&s;e, for the
Tree was &s;o thick, that no Shot would enter
it. They made no Doubt however, but that they
had their Enemies in a Trap, and that a &s;mall
Siege would either bring them down Tree and all,
or &s;tarve them out: So they re&s;olved to keep
their Po&s;t, and &s;end to us for Help. According|ly
two of them came away to us for more Hands,
and particularly de&s;ired, that &s;ome of our Car|penters
might come with Tools, to help cut down
the Tree, or at lea&s;t to cut down other Wood,
and &s;et Fire to it; and That they concluded
would not fail to bring them out.</P>
<P>Accordingly our Men went like a little Ar|my,
and with mighty Preparations for an En|terprize,
the like of which has &s;carce been ever
heard, to form the Siege of a great Tree. How|ever,
when they came there, they found the
Task difficult enough, for the old Trunk was in|deed
a very great one, and very tall, being at
lea&s;t Two and Twenty Foot high, with &s;even old
Limbs &s;tanding out every Way on the Top, but
decay'd, and very few Leaves, if any, left on it.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> the Quaker, who&s;e Curio&s;ity led him
to go among the re&s;t, propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould
make a Ladder, and get up upon the Top, and
then throw Wild-fire into the Tree, and &s;moke
them out. Others propo&s;ed going back, and
getting a great Gun out of the Ship, which
&s;hould &s;plit the Tree in Pieces with the Iron
Bullets: Others, that they &s;hould cut down a
great deal of Wood, and pile it up round the
Tree, and &s;et it on Fire, and to burn the Tree,
and the <HI>Indians</HI> in it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;ultations took up our People no
le&s;s than two or three Days, in all which Time
<PB N="256" REF="274">
they heard nothing of the &s;uppo&s;ed Garri&s;on
within this wooden Ca&s;tle, nor any Noi&s;e with|in.
<HI>William</HI>'s Project was fir&s;t gone about, and
a large &s;trong Ladder was made, to &s;cale this
wooden Tower; and in two or three Hours time,
it would have been ready to mount: When, on
a &s;udden, they heard the Noi&s;e of the <HI>Indians</HI> in
the Body of the Tree again, and a little after, &s;e|veral
of them appeared in the Top of the Tree,
and threw &s;ome Launces down at our Men; one
of which &s;truck one of our Seamen a-top of the
Shoulder, and gave him &s;uch a de&s;perate Wound,
that the Surgeons not only had a great deal of
Difficulty to cure him, but the poor Man endu|red
&s;uch horrible Tortures, that we all &s;aid they
had better have killed him outright. However,
he was cured at la&s;t, tho' he never recover'd the
perfect U&s;e of his Arm, the Launce having cut
&s;ome of the Tendons on the Top of the Arm,
near the Shoulder, which, as I &s;uppo&s;e, perfor|med
the Office of Motion to the Limb before;
&s;o that the poor Man was a Criple all the Days of
his Life. But to return to the de&s;perate Rogues
in the Tree; our Men &s;hot at them, but did not
find they had hit them, or any of them; but as
&s;oon as ever they &s;hot at them, they could hear
them huddle down into the Trunk of the Tree
again, and there to be &s;ure they were &s;afe.</P>
<P>Well, however, it was this which put by the
Project of <HI>William</HI>'s Ladder; for when it was done,
who would venture up among &s;uch a Troop of
bold Creatures as were there? And who, they
&s;uppo&s;ed, were de&s;perate by their Circum&s;tances:
And as but one Man at a time could go up, they
began to think that it would not do; and in|deed
I was of the Opinion, <HI>for about this time I
<PB N="257" REF="275">
was come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> that the going up the
Ladder would not do, unle&s;s it was thus, that
a Man &s;hould, as it were run ju&s;t up to the Top,
and throw &s;ome Fire-works into the Tree, and
&s;o come down again; and this we did two or
three Times, but found no Effect of it. At la&s;t,
one of our Gunners made a Stink-pot, as we cal|led
it, being a Compo&s;ition which only &s;mokes,
but does not flame or burn; but withal the
Smoke of it is &s;o thick, and the Smell of it &s;o
intolerably nau&s;eous, that it is not to be &s;uffe|red.
This he threw into the Tree him&s;elf, and
we waited for the Effect of it, but heard or &s;aw
nothing all that Night, or the next Day; &s;o we
concluded the Men within were all &s;mother'd:
When, on a &s;udden, the next Night, we heard
them upon the Top of the Tree again, &s;houting
and hallooing like Madmen.</P>
<P>We concluded, as any body would, that this
was to call for Help, and we re&s;olved to conti|nue
our Siege; for we were all enraged to &s;ee
our &s;elves &s;o baulk'd by a few wild People whom
we thought we had &s;afe in our Clutches; and
indeed never was there &s;o many concurring Cir|cum&s;tances
to delude Men, in any Ca&s;e we had
met with. We re&s;olved however to try another
Stink-pot the next Night, and our Engineer and
Gunner had got it ready, when hearing a Noi&s;e
of the Enemy, on the Top of the Tree, and in
the Body of the Tree, I was not willing to let
the Gunner go up the Ladder, which, I &s;aid,
would be but to be certain of being murthered.
However, he found a <HI>Medium</HI> for it, and that was
to go up a few Steps, and with a long Pole in
his Hand, to throw it in upon the Top of the
Tree, the Ladder being &s;tanding all this while
<PB N="258" REF="276">
again&s;t the Top of the Tree; but when the Gun|ner,
with his Machine at the Top of his Pole,
came to the Tree with three other Men to help
him, behold the Ladder was gone.</P>
<P>This perfectly confounded us, and we now con|cluded
the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Tree had by this Piece
of Negligence taken the Opportunity, and come
all down the Ladder, made their E&s;cape, and had
carried away the Ladder with them. I laugh'd
mo&s;t heartily at my Friend <HI>William,</HI> who, as I
&s;aid, had the Direction of the Siege, and had &s;et
up a Ladder, for the Garri&s;on, <HI>as we called them,</HI>
to get down upon, and run away. But when
Day-Light came, we were all &s;et to rights again;
for there &s;tood our Ladder haul'd up on the Top
of the Tree, with about Half of it in the Hol|low
of the Tree, and the other Half upright in
the Air. Then we began to laugh at the <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
for Fools, that they could not as well have
found their Way down by the Ladder, and have
made their E&s;cape, as to have pull'd it up by main
Strength into the Tree.</P>
<P>We then re&s;olved upon Fire, and &s;o to put an
End to the Work at once, and burn the Tree
and its Inhabitants together; and accordingly
we went to Work to cut Wood, and in a few
Hours time we got enough, as we thought,
together; and piling it up round the Bottom
of the Tree, we &s;et it on Fire: So waiting at a
Di&s;tance, to &s;ee when the Gentlemens Quarters
being too hot for them, they would come flying
out at the Top. But we were quite confounded,
when, on a &s;udden, we found the Fire all put
out by a great Quantity of Water thrown upon
it. We then thought the Devil mu&s;t be in them
to be &s;ure. Says <HI>William,</HI> this is certainly the
<PB N="259" REF="277">
cunninge&s;t Piece of <HI>Indian</HI> Engineering that ever
was heard of, and there can be but one thing more
to gue&s;s at, be&s;ides Witchcraft and Dealing with
the Devil, <HI>which I believe not one Word of, &s;ays he;</HI>
and that mu&s;t be, that this is an artificial Tree,
or a natural Tree artificially made hollow down
into the Earth, thro' Root and all; and that the&s;e
Creatures have an artificial Cavity underneath it,
quite into the Hill, or a Way to go thro', and
under the Hill, to &s;ome other Place, and where
that other Place is, we know not; but if it be
not our own Fault, I'll find the Place, and fol|low
them into it, before I am two Days older.
He then called the Carpenters to know of them,
if they had any large Saws that would cut thro'
the Body, and they told him they had not any
Saws that were long enough, nor could Men
work into &s;uch a mon&s;trous old Stump in a great
while; but that they would go to Work with
it with their Axes, and undertake to cut it down
in two Days, and &s;tock up the Root of it in two
more. But <HI>William</HI> was for another Way, which
proved much better than all this; for he was
for &s;ilent Work, that, if po&s;&s;ible, he might catch
&s;ome of the Fellows in it; &s;o he &s;ets twelve
Men to it with large Augurs, to bore great Holes
into the Side of the Tree, to go almo&s;t thro', but
not quite thro'; which Holes were bored with|out
Noi&s;e, and when they were done, he filled
them all with Gun-Powder, &s;topping &s;trong Plugs
bolted cro&s;s-ways into the Holes, and then boring
a &s;lanting Hole of a le&s;s Size down into the greater
Hole, all which were fill'd with Powder, and at
once blown up. When they took Fire, they
made &s;uch a Noi&s;e, and tore and &s;plit the Tree
in &s;o many Places, and in &s;uch a Manner, that
<PB N="260" REF="278">
we could &s;ee plainly, &s;uch another Bla&s;t would
demoli&s;h it, and &s;o it did. Thus at the &s;econd
time we could at two or three Places put our
Hands into them, and di&s;covered the Cheat,
namely, that there was a Cave or Hole dug in|to
the Earth, from, or thro' the Bottom of the
Hollow, and that it had Communication with
another Cave further in, where we heard the
Voices of &s;everal of the wild Folks calling and
talking to one another.</P>
<P>When we came thus far we had a great Mind
to get at them, and <HI>William</HI> de&s;ired, that three
Men might be given him with Hand-Grenadoes,
and he promi&s;ed to go down fir&s;t, and boldly he
did &s;o; for <HI>William,</HI> give him his due, had the
Heart of a Lion.</P>
<P>They had Pi&s;tols in their Hands, and Swords
by their Sides; but, as they had taught the <HI>In|dians</HI>
before, by their Stink-Pots, the <HI>Indians</HI> re|turned
them in their own Kind, for they made
&s;uch a Smoke come up out of the Entrance into
the Cave or Hollow, that <HI>William</HI> and his three Men,
were glad to come running out of the Cave, and
out of the Tree too, for mere want of Breath,
and indeed they were almo&s;t &s;tifled.</P>
<P>Never was a Fortification &s;o well defended, or
A&s;&s;ailants &s;o many ways defeated; we were
now for giving it over, and particularly I called
<HI>William,</HI> and told him, I could not but laugh to
&s;ee us &s;pinning out our Time here for nothing;
that I could not imagine what we were doing,
that it was certain the Rogues that were in it
were cunning to the la&s;t Degree, and it would
vex any Body to be &s;o baulked by a few naked
ignorant Fellows; but &s;till it was not worth our
while to pu&s;h it any further, nor was there any
<PB N="261" REF="279">
thing that I knew of to be got by the Conque&s;t
when it was made, &s;o that I thought it high time
to give it over.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> acknowledged, that what I &s;aid was
ju&s;t, and that there was nothing but our Curio|&s;ity
to be gratified in this Attempt; and tho',
as <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he was very de&s;irous to have
&s;earched into the Thing, yet he would not in&s;i&s;t
upon it, &s;o we re&s;olved to quit it, and come
away, which we did. However, <HI>William</HI> &s;aid,
before we went, he would have this Satisfaction
of them, <HI>viz.</HI> that he burnt down the Tree and
&s;topt up the Entrance into the Cave. While he
was doing this, the Gunner told him, he would
have one Satisfaction of the Rogues, and this
was, that he would make a Mine of it, and &s;ee
which way it had Vent: Upon this he fetches
two Barrels of Powder out of the Ships, and
placed them in the In&s;ide of the hollow Cave, as
far in as he dur&s;t go to carry them, and then
filling up the Mouth of the Cave where the Tree
&s;tood, and ramming it &s;ufficiently hard, leaving
only a Pipe or Touch-hole, he gave Fire to it,
and &s;tood at a Di&s;tance to &s;ee which way it
would operate, when, on the &s;udden, he found
the Force of the Powder bur&s;t its way out among
&s;ome Bu&s;hes on the other Side the little Hill I
mentioned, and that it came roaring out there
as out of the Mouth of a Cannon; immediate|ly
running thither we &s;aw the Effects of the
Powder.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We &s;aw that <HI>there</HI> was the other Mouth
of the Cave, which the Powder had &s;o torn and
open'd, that the loo&s;e Earth was &s;o fallen in
again, that nothing of Shape could be di&s;cerned;
but there we &s;aw what was become of the Garri|&s;on
<PB N="262" REF="280">
of <HI>Indians</HI> too, who had given us all this
Trouble; for &s;ome of them had no Arms, &s;ome
no Legs, &s;ome no Head, &s;ome lay half buried
in the Rubbi&s;h of the Mine, that is to &s;ay, in
the loo&s;e Earth that fell in; and, in &s;hort,
there was a mi&s;erable Havock made of them
all, for we had good Rea&s;on to believe, not one
of them that were in the In&s;ide could e&s;cape,
but rather were &s;hot out of the Mouth of the
Cave like a Bullet out of a Gun.</P>
<P>We had now our full Satisfaction of the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI>
but, in &s;hort, this was a lo&s;ing Voyage, for
we had two Men killed, one quite crippled,
five more wounded; we &s;pent two Barrels of
Powder, and eleven Days Time, and all to get
the Under&s;tanding how to make an <HI>Indian</HI> Mine,
or how to keep Garri&s;on in a hollow Tree, and
with this Wit bought at this dear Price, we
came away, having taken in &s;ome fre&s;h Water,
but got no fre&s;h Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>We then con&s;idered what we &s;hould do to get
back again to <HI>Madaga&s;car;</HI> we were much about
the Latitude of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> but had
&s;uch a very long Run, and were neither &s;ure
of meeting with fair Winds, or with any
Land in the Way, that we knee not what to
think of it. <HI>William</HI> was our la&s;t Re&s;ort in this
Ca&s;e again, and he was very plain with us.
Friend, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to <HI>CAPT. WILMOT,</HI> what Oc|ca&s;ion
ha&s;t thou to run the Venture of &s;tarving,
merely for the Plea&s;ure of &s;aying, thou ha&s;t
been where no Body ever was before; there are
a great many Places nearer home, of which thou
maye&s;t &s;ay the &s;ame thing, at a le&s;s Expence; I
&s;ee no Occa&s;ion thou ha&s;t of keeping thus far
South, any longer than till you are &s;ure you are
<PB N="263" REF="281">
to the We&s;t End of <HI>Iava</HI> and <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and then
thou may'&s;t &s;tand away North towards <HI>Ceylon,</HI>
and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel</HI> and <HI>Maderas,</HI> where
thou may'&s;t get both fre&s;h Water, and fre&s;h
Provi&s;ions, and to that Part it's likely we may
hold out well enough with the Stores that we have
already.</P>
<P>This was whole&s;ome Advice, and &s;uch as was
not to be &s;lighted, &s;o we &s;tood away to the We&s;t,
keeping between the Latitude of 31, and 35, and
had very good Weather and fair Winds for about
ten Days Sail, by which Time, by our Reckoning,
we were clear of the I&s;les, and might run away
to the North; and, if we did not fall in with
<HI>Ceylon,</HI> we &s;hould at lea&s;t go into the great deep
Bay of <HI>Bengal.</HI></P>
<P>But we were out in our Reckoning a great
deal, for when we had &s;tood due North for
about fifteen or &s;ixteen Degrees, we met with
Land again on our Star-board Bow, about three
Leagues Di&s;tance, &s;o we came to an Anchor
about half a League from it, and Manned out
our Boats to &s;ee what &s;ort of a Country it was:
We found it a very good one, fre&s;h Water ea&s;y
to come at, but no Cattle, that we could &s;ee, or
Inhabitants, and we were very &s;hye of &s;earching
too far after them, le&s;t we &s;hould make &s;uch
another Journey as we did la&s;t; &s;o that we let
rambling alone, and cho&s;e rather to take what
we could find, which was only a few wild Man|goes,
and &s;ome Plants of &s;everal Kinds, which
we knew not the Names of.</P>
<P>We made no Stay here, but put to Sea again,
N. W. by N. but had little Wind for a Fortnight
more, when we made Land again, and &s;tanding
in with the Shore, we were &s;urprized to find
<PB N="264" REF="282">
our &s;elves on the South Shore of <HI>Iava;</HI> and ju&s;t
as we were coming to an Anchor, we &s;aw a Boat
carrying <HI>Dutch</HI> Colours, &s;ailing along Shore. We
were not &s;ollicitous to &s;peak with them, or any
other of their Nation, but left it indifferent to
our People, when they went on Shore, to &s;ee
the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> or not to &s;ee them; our Bu&s;ine&s;s
was to get Provi&s;ions, which indeed by this time
were very &s;hort with us.</P>
<P>We re&s;olved to go on Shore with our Boats in
the mo&s;t convenient Place we could find, and to
look out a proper Harbour to bring the Ship
into, leaving it to our Fate, whether we &s;hould
meet with Friends or Enemies, re&s;olving howe|ver,
not to &s;tay any con&s;iderable Time, at lea&s;t,
not long enough to have Expre&s;&s;es &s;ent cro&s;s the
I&s;land to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and for Ships to come round
from thence to attack us.</P>
<P>We found, according to our De&s;ire, a very
good Harbour, where we rode in &s;even Fathom
Water, well defended from the Weather, what|ever
might happen, and here we got fre&s;h Pro|vi&s;ions,
&s;uch as good Hogs, and &s;ome Cows; and
that we might lay in a little Store, we kill'd
&s;ixteen Cows, and pickled and barrelled up the
Fle&s;h as well as we could be &s;uppo&s;ed to do in the
Latitude of eight Degrees from the Line.</P>
<P>We did all this in about five Days, and filled
our Casks with Water, and the la&s;t Boat was
coming off with Herbs and Roots, we being un|moor'd,
and our Fore Top-Sail loo&s;e for &s;ailing,
when we &s;py'd a large Ship to the Northward,
bearing down directly upon us; we knew not what
&s;he might be, but concluded the wor&s;t, and made
all po&s;&s;ible Ha&s;te to get our Anchor up, and get
under Sail, that we might be in a Readine&s;s to
<PB N="265" REF="283">
&s;ee what &s;he had to &s;ay to us, for we were un|der
no great Concern for one Ship; but our No|tion
was, that we &s;hould be attack'd by three or
four together.</P>
<P>By the time we had got up our Anchor, and
the Boat was &s;tow'd, the Ship was within a League
of us, and, as we thought, bore down to engage
us; &s;o we &s;pread our black Flag or Ancient on
the Poop, and the bloody Flag at the Top-ma&s;t
Head, and having made a clear Ship, we &s;tretcht
away to the We&s;tward, to get the Wind of him.</P>
<P>They had, it &s;eems, quite mi&s;taken us before,
expecting nothing of an Enemy or a Pyrate in
tho&s;e Seas, and not doubting but we had been
one of their own Ships, they &s;eem'd to be in
&s;ome Confu&s;ion when they found their Mi&s;take; &s;o
they immediately haul'd up on a-Wind on t'other
Tack, and &s;tood edging in for the Shore, towards
the Ea&s;termo&s;t Part of the I&s;land. Upon this we
tack'd, and &s;tood, after him with all the Sail we
could, and in two Hours came almo&s;t within Gun
Shot. Tho' they crowded all the Sail they could
lay on, there was no Remedy but to engage us,
and they &s;oon &s;aw their Inequality of Force.
We fired a Gun for them to bring to, &s;o they
Mann'd out their Boat, and &s;ent to us with a
Flag of Truce. We &s;ent back the Boat, but
with this An&s;wer to the Captain, that he had
nothing to do, but to &s;trike, and bring his Ship
to an Anchor under our Stern, and come on board
us him&s;elf, when he &s;hould know our Demands;
but that however, &s;ince he had not yet put us
to the Trouble of forcing him, which we &s;aw we
were able to do, we a&s;&s;ured them, that the Cap|tain
&s;hould return again in Safety, and all his
Men; and that &s;upplying us with &s;uch things as
<PB N="266" REF="284">
we &s;hould demand, his Ship &s;hould not be plun|dered.
They went back with this Me&s;&s;age, and
it was &s;ome time after they were on board, be|fore
they &s;truck, which made us begin to think
they refu&s;ed it; &s;o we fired a Shot, and in a few
Minutes more we perceived their Boat put off;
and as &s;oon as the Boat put off, the Ship &s;truck,
and came to an Anchor, as was directed.</P>
<P>When the Captain came on board, we deman|ded
an Account of their Cargo, which was chief|ly
Bales of Goods from <HI>Bengal</HI> for <HI>Bantam.</HI> We
told them our pre&s;ent Want was Provi&s;ions,
which they had no need of, being ju&s;t at the
End of their Voyage; and that if they would
&s;end their Boat on Shore with ours, and pro|cure
us &s;ix and twenty Head of black Cattel,
three&s;core Hogs, a Quantity of Brandy and Ar|rack,
and three Hundred Bu&s;hels of Rice, we
would let them go free.</P>
<P>As to the Rice, they gave us &s;ix Hundred
Bu&s;hels, which they had actually on board, to|gether
with a Parcel Shipt upon Freight. Also
they gave us thirty middling Casks of very good
Arrack, but Beef and Pork they had none. How|ever,
they went on Shore with our Men, and
bought eleven Bullocks and fifty Hogs, which
were pickled up for our Occa&s;ion, and upon the
Supplies of Provi&s;ion from Shore, we di&s;mi&s;s'd
them and their Ship.</P>
<P>We lay here &s;even Days before we could fur|ni&s;h
our &s;elves with the Provi&s;ions agreed for,
and &s;ome of the Men fancied the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> were
contriving our De&s;truction; but they were very
hone&s;t, and did what they could to furni&s;h the
Black Cattel, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upply
&s;o many. So they came and told us ingenuou&s;ly,
<PB N="267" REF="285">
that unle&s;s we could &s;tay a while longer, they
could get no more Oxen or Cows than tho&s;e
Eleven, with which we were obliged to be &s;ati&s;|fied,
taking the Value of them in other things,
rather than &s;tay longer there. On our Side we
were punctual with them in ob&s;erving the Condi|tions
we had agreed on, nor would we let any
of our Men &s;o much as go on board them, or
&s;uffer any of their Men to come on board us;
for had any of our Men gone on board, no body
could have an&s;wer'd for their Behaviour, any
more than if they had been on Shore in an
Enemy's Country.</P>
<P>We were now Victualled for our Voyage, and
as we matter'd not Purcha&s;e, we went merrily
on for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> where we intended
to touch to get fre&s;h Water again, and more
Provi&s;ions; and we had nothing material offer'd
in this Part of the Voyage, only that we met
with contrary Winds, and were above a Month
in the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>We put in upon the South Coa&s;t of the I&s;land,
de&s;iring to have as little to do with the <HI>Dutch</HI>
as we could; and as the <HI>Dutch</HI> were Lords of
the Country as to Commerce, &s;o they are more
&s;o of the Sea Coa&s;t, where they have &s;everal
Forts, and in particular, have all the Cinnamon,
which is the Trade of that I&s;land.</P>
<P>We took in fre&s;h Water here, and &s;ome Pro|vi&s;ions,
but did not much trouble our &s;elves
about laying in any Stores, our Beef and Hogs
which we got at <HI>Iava</HI> being not yet all gone by
a good deal. We had a little Skirmi&s;h on Shore
here with &s;ome of the People of the I&s;land, &s;ome
of our Men having been a little too familiar with
the <HI>Homely Ladies</HI> of the Country; for Homely
<PB N="268" REF="286">
indeed they were, to &s;uch a Degree, that if our
Men had not had good Stomachs that Way, they
would &s;carce have touch'd any of them.</P>
<P>I could never fully get it out of our Men what
they did, they were &s;o true to one another in
their Wickedne&s;s; but I under&s;tood in the main,
that it was &s;ome barbarous thing they had done,
and that they had like to have paid dear for
it; for the Men re&s;ented it to the la&s;t Degree,
and gathered in &s;uch Numbers about them, that
had not &s;ixteen more of our Men, in another
Boat, come all in the Nick of Time, ju&s;t to re|&s;cue
our fir&s;t Men, who were but Eleven, and
&s;o fetch them off by main Force, they had been
all cut off, the Inhabitants being no le&s;s than two
or three Hundred, armed with Darts and Laun|ces,
the u&s;ual Weapons of the Country, and
which they are very dexterous at the throwing,
even &s;o dexterous, that it was &s;carce credible:
And had our Men &s;tood to fight them, as &s;ome
of them were bold enough to talk of, they had
been all overwhelmed and kill'd. As it was,
&s;eventeen of our Men were wounded, and &s;ome
of them very dangerou&s;ly. But they were more
frighted than hurt too; for every one of them
gave them&s;elves over for dead Men, believing
the Launces were poi&s;oned. But <HI>William</HI> was our
Comfort here too; for when two of our Surge|ons
were of the &s;ame Opinion, and told the Men
fooli&s;hly enough, that they would die, <HI>William</HI>
chearfully went to Work with them, and cured
them all but one, who rather died by drinking
&s;ome Arrack Punch, than of his Wound, the
Exce&s;s of Drinking throwing him into a Fever.</P>
<P>We had enough of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> tho' &s;ome of our
People were for going a&s;hore again, &s;ixty or
<PB N="269" REF="287">
&s;eventy Men together, to be revenged; but
<HI>William</HI> per&s;waded them again&s;t it, and his Re|putation
was &s;o great among the Men, as well as
with us that were Commanders, that he could
influence them more than any of us.</P>
<P>They were mighty warm upon their Revenge,
and they would go on Shore, and de&s;troy five
Hundred of them. Well, &s;ays <HI>William,</HI> and &s;up|po&s;e
you do, what are you the better? Why
then, &s;ays one of them, &s;peaking for the re&s;t,
we &s;hall have our Satisfaction. Well, and what
will you be the better for that, &s;ays <HI>William?</HI>
They could then &s;ay nothing to that. Then,
&s;ays <HI>William,</HI> if I mi&s;take not, your Bu&s;ine&s;s is
Money: Now I de&s;ire to know, if you conquer
and kill two or three Thou&s;and of the&s;e poor
Creatures, they have no Money, pray what will
you get? They are poor naked Wretches, what
&s;hall you gain by them? But then &s;aid <HI>William,</HI>
perhaps, in doing this, you may chance to lo&s;e
Half a Score of your own Company, as 'tis
very probable you may, pray, what Gain is in
it, and what Account can you give the Captain
for his lo&s;t Men? In &s;hort, <HI>William</HI> argued &s;o
effectually, that he convinc'd them that it was
mere Murther, to do &s;o; and that the Men had a
Right to their own, and that they had no Right
to take them away: That it was de&s;troying
innocent Men, who had acted no otherwi&s;e than
as the Laws of Nature dictated; and that it
would be as much Murther to do &s;o, as to meet
a Man on the High-way, and kill him, for the
mere &s;ake of it, in cold Blood, not regarding whe|ther
he had done any Wrong to us or no.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rea&s;ons prevailed with them at la&s;t, and
they were content to go away, and leave them
<PB N="270" REF="288">
as they found them. In the fir&s;t Skirmi&s;h they
killed between &s;ixty and &s;eventy Men, and
wounded a great many more, but they had no|thing,
and our People got nothing by it, but the
Lo&s;s of one Man's Life, and the Wounding &s;ixteen
more, as above.</P>
<P>But another Accident brought us to a Nece&s;&s;ity
of further Bu&s;ine&s;s with the&s;e People, and indeed
we had like to have put an End to our Lives and Ad|ventures
all at once among them; for, about three
Days after our Putting out to Sea, from the Place
where we had that Skirmi&s;h, we were attack'd
by a violent Storm of Wind from the South, or
rather a Hurricane of Wind from all the Points
Southward, for it blew in a mo&s;t de&s;perate and
furious Manner, from the S. E. to the S. W.
one Minute at one Point, and then in&s;tantly turn|ing
about again to another Point, but with the
&s;ame Violence; nor were we able to work the
Ship in that Condition: So that the Ship I was
in &s;plit three Top&s;ails, and at la&s;t brought the
Main Top-ma&s;t by the Board; and in a Word,
we were once or twice driven right a&s;hore; and
one time, had not the Wind &s;hifted the very
Moment it did, we had been da&s;h'd in a Thou|&s;and
Pieces upon a great Ledge of Rocks, which
lay off about Half a League from the Shore; but,
as I have &s;aid, the Wind &s;hifting very often, and
at that time coming to the E. S. E. we &s;tretcht
off, and got above a League more Sea-room in
Half an Hour. After that, it blew with &s;ome
Fury S. W. by S. then S. W. by W. and put us
back again a great Way to the Ea&s;tward of the
Ledge of Rocks, where we found a fair Opening
between the Rocks and the Land, and endea|voured
to come to an Anchor there; but we
<PB N="271" REF="289">
found there was no Ground fit to Anchor in, and
that we &s;hould lo&s;e our Anchors, there being no|thing
but Rocks. We &s;tood thro' the Opening,
which held about four Leagues; the Storm con|tinued,
and now we found a dreadful foul Shore,
and knew not what Cour&s;e to take. We look'd
out very narrowly for &s;ome River, or Creek, or
Bay, where we might run in, and come to an
Anchor, but found none a great while. At length
we &s;aw a great Head-Land lye out far South into
the Sea, and that to &s;uch a Length, that, in &s;hort,
we &s;aw plainly, that if the Wind held where it
was, we could not Weather it; &s;o we run in as
much under the Lee of the Point as we could,
and came to an Anchor in about twelve Fathom
Water.</P>
<P>But the Wind veering again in the Night, and
blowing exceeding hard, our Anchors came home,
and the Ship drove till the Rudder &s;truck again&s;t
the Ground; and had the Ship gone Half her
Length further, &s;he had been lo&s;t, and every one
of us with her. But our Sheet Anchor held its
own, and we heaved in &s;ome of the Cable, to get
clear of the Ground we had &s;truck upon. It was
by this only Cable that we rode it out all Night,
and towards Morning we thought the Wind aba|ted
a little, and it was well for us that it was &s;o;
for in &s;pite of what our Sheet Anchor did for us,
we found the Ship fa&s;t a-ground in the Morning,
to our very great Surprize and Amazement.</P>
<P>When the Tide was out, tho' the Water here
ebb'd away, the Ship lay almo&s;t dry upon a
Bank of hard Sand, which never, I &s;uppo&s;e, had
any Ship upon it before; the People of the Coun|try
came down in great Numbers, to look at us,
and gaze, not knowing what we were, but gaping
<PB N="272" REF="290">
at us as at a great Sight or Wonder, at which
they were &s;urpriz'd, and knew not what to do.</P>
<P>I have Rea&s;on to believe, that upon the Sight
they immediately &s;ent an Account of a Ship being
there, and of the Condition we were in; for the
next Day there appeared a great Man, whether
it was their King or no, I knew not, but he had
Abundance of Men with him, and &s;ome with long
Javelins in their Hands, as long as Half Pikes;
and the&s;e came all down to the Water's Edge, and
drew up in very good Order ju&s;t in our View.
They &s;tood near an Hour without making any
Motion, and then there came near twenty of
them with a Man before them, carrying a white
Flag before them. They came forward into the
Water as high as their Wa&s;tes, the Sea not going
&s;o high as before, for the Wind was abated, and
blew off Shore.</P>
<P>The Man made a long Oration to us, as we
could &s;ee by his Ge&s;tures, and we &s;ometimes heard
his Voice, but knew not a Word he &s;aid. <HI>William,</HI>
who was always u&s;eful to us, I believe, was here
again the Saving of all our Lives. The Ca&s;e was
this. The Fellow, or what I might call him,
when his Speech was done, gave three great
Screams, for I know not what el&s;e to &s;ay they
were, then lower'd his white Flag three times,
and then made three Motions to us with his Arm,
to come to him.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, that I was for Manning out the
Boat, and going to them; but <HI>William</HI> would
by no means allow me: He told me, we ought
to tru&s;t no Body; that if they were the Barbari|ans,
and under their own Government, we might
be &s;ure to be all murthered; and if they were
Chri&s;tians, we &s;hould not fare much better, if
<PB N="273" REF="291">
they knew who we were; that it was the Cu&s;tom
of the <HI>Malabars,</HI> to betray all People that they
could get into their Hands; and that the&s;e were
&s;ome of the &s;ame People; and that if we had
any Regard to our own Safety, we &s;hould not
go to them by any means. I oppo&s;ed him a great
while, and told him, I thought he u&s;ed to be
always right, but that now I thought he was not;
that I was no more for running needle&s;s Ri&s;ques,
than he, or any one el&s;e; but I thought all Na|tions
in the World, even the mo&s;t &s;avage People,
when they held out a Flag of Peace, kept the
Offer of Peace made by that Signal, very &s;acred|ly,
and I gave him &s;everal Examples of it in my
Hi&s;tory of my <HI>African</HI> Travels, which I have here
gone thro' in the Beginning of this Work; and
that I could not think the&s;e People wor&s;e than
&s;ome of them. And be&s;ides, I told him, our
Ca&s;e &s;eem'd to be &s;uch, that we mu&s;t fall into
&s;ome body's Hands or other, and that we had
better fall into their Hands by a friendly Treaty,
than by a forced Submi&s;&s;ion; nay, tho' they had
indeed a treacherous De&s;ign; and therefore I was
for a Parley with them.</P>
<P>Well, Friend, &s;ays <HI>William</HI> very gravely, if thou
wilt go, I cannot help it; I &s;hall only de&s;ire to
take my la&s;t Leave of thee at Parting, for depend
upon it, thou wilt never &s;ee us again: Whether
we in the Ship may come off any better at la&s;t, I
cannot re&s;olve thee; but this I will an&s;wer for, that
we will not give up our Lives idly, and in cool
Blood, as thou art going to do; we will at lea&s;t
pre&s;erve our &s;elves as long as we can, and die at
la&s;t like Men, not like Fools trapann'd by the
Wiles of a few Barbarians.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="292">
<HI>William</HI> &s;poke this with &s;o much Warmth, and
yet with &s;o much A&s;&s;urance of our Fate, that I
began to think a little of the Ri&s;que I was go|ing
to run. I had no more Mind to be murthe|red
than he; and yet I could not for my Life be
&s;o faint-hearted in the thing, as he. Upon which
I asked him, if he had any Knowledge of the
Place, or had ever been here? He &s;aid, <HI>No.</HI> Then
I asked him, if he had heard or read any thing
about the People of this I&s;land, and of their Way
of treating any Chri&s;tians that had fallen into
their Hands? And he told me, he had heard of
one, and he would tell me the Story afterward.
His Name, he &s;aid, was <HI>Knox,</HI> Commander of an
<HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Ship, who was driven on Shore, ju&s;t as
we were, upon this I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> tho' he could
not &s;ay it was at the &s;ame Place, or whereabouts:
That he was beguiled by the Barbarians, and in|ticed
to come on Shore, ju&s;t as we were invited to
do at that time; and that when they had him,
they &s;urrounded him and eighteen or twenty of
his Men, and never &s;uffered them to return, but
kept them Pri&s;oners, or murthered them, he
could not well tell which; but they were carried
away up into the Country, &s;eparated from one
another, and never heard of afterwards, except
the Captain's Son, who miraculou&s;ly made his
E&s;cape after twenty Years Slavery.</P>
<P>I had no Time then to ask him to give the
full Story of this <HI>Knox,</HI> much le&s;s to hear him
tell it me; but as it is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es, when
one begins to be a little touch'd, I turn'd &s;hort
with him, Why then, Friend <HI>William,</HI> &s;aid I,
what would you have us do? You &s;ee what
Condition we are in, and what is before us; &s;ome|thing
mu&s;t be done, and that immediately. Why,
<PB N="275" REF="293">
&s;ays <HI>William,</HI> I'll tell thee what thou &s;halt do: Fir&s;t
cau&s;e a white Flag to be hang'd out, as they do
to us, and Man out the Long-Boat and Pinnace
with as many Men as they can well &s;tow, to han|dle
their Arms, and let me go with them, and
thou &s;halt &s;ee what we will do. If I mi&s;carry, thou
may'&s;t be &s;afe; and I will al&s;o tell thee, that if I
do mi&s;carry, it &s;hall be my own Fault, and thou
&s;halt learn Wit by my Folly.</P>
<P>I knew not what to reply to him at fir&s;t; but
after &s;ome Pau&s;e, I &s;aid, <HI>William, William,</HI> I am
as loath you &s;hould be lo&s;t, as you are that I
&s;hould; and if there be any Danger, I de&s;ire you
may no more fall into it than I. Therefore, if
you will, let us all keep in the Ship, fare alike,
and take our Fate together.</P>
<P>No, no, &s;ays <HI>William,</HI> there's no Danger in the
Method I propo&s;e; thou &s;halt go with me, if
thou thinke&s;t fit. If thou plea&s;e&s;t but to follow
the Mea&s;ures that I &s;hall re&s;olve on, depend upon
it, tho' we will go off from the Ships, we will not a
Man of us go any nearer them than within Call
to talk with them. Thou &s;ee&s;t they have no
Boats to come off to us; but, &s;ays he, I rather
de&s;ire thou would&s;t take my Advice, and manage
the Ship, as I &s;hall give the Signal from the Boat,
and let us concert that Matter together before we
go off.</P>
<P>Well, I found <HI>William</HI> had his Mea&s;ures in his
Head all laid before-hand, and was not at a Lo&s;s
what to do at all; &s;o I told him he &s;hould be Cap|tain
for this Voyage, and we would be all of us
under his Orders, which I would &s;ee ob&s;erved to
a Tittle.</P>
<P>Upon this Conclu&s;ion of our Debates, he or|dered
four and Twenty Men into the Long-Boat,
<PB N="276" REF="294">
and twelve Men into the Pinnace, and the Sea
being now pretty &s;mooth, they went off, being
all very well arm'd. Al&s;o he ordered, that all
the Guns of the great Ship, on the Side which
lay next the Shore, &s;hould be loaded with Mu&s;|quet
Balls, old Nails, Stubbs, and &s;uch like Pieces
of old Iron, Lead, and any thing that came to
Hand; and that we &s;hould prepare to fire as &s;oon
as ever he &s;aw us lower the white Flag, and hoi&s;t
up a red one in the Pinnace.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Mea&s;ures fix'd between us, they
went off towards the Shore, <HI>William</HI> in the Pin|nace
with twelve Men, and the Long-Boat coming
after him with four and twenty more, all &s;tout,
re&s;olute Fellows, and very well arm'd. They
row'd &s;o near the Shore, as that they might &s;peak
to one another, carrying a white Flag as the other
did, and offerring a <HI>Parle.</HI> The Brutes, for &s;uch
they were, &s;hewed them&s;elves very courteous, but
finding we could not under&s;tand them, they
fetch'd an old <HI>Dutchman,</HI> who had been their
Pri&s;oner many Years, and &s;et him to &s;peak to us.
The Sum and Sub&s;tance of his Speech was, That
the King of the Country had &s;ent his General
down to know who we were, and what our Bu|&s;ine&s;s
was? <HI>William</HI> &s;tood up in the Stern of the
Pinnace, and told him, That as to that, he that
was an <HI>European</HI> by his Language and Voice, might
ea&s;ily know what we were, and our Condition;
the Ship being a-ground upon the Sand, would
al&s;o tell him, that our Bu&s;ine&s;s there was that of
a Ship in Di&s;tre&s;s; &s;o <HI>William</HI> de&s;ired to know
what they came down for with &s;uch a Multitude,
and with Arms and Weapons, as if they came to
War with us.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="295">
He an&s;wered, they might have good Rea&s;on
to come down to the Shore, the Country being
alarmed with the Appearance of Ships of Stran|gers
upon the Coa&s;t; and as our Ve&s;&s;els were full
of Men, and that we had Guns and Weapons, the
King had &s;ent Part of his military Men, that, in
Ca&s;e of any Inva&s;ion upon the Country, they
might be ready to defend them&s;elves, what&s;oe|ver
might be the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays he, as you are Men in Di&s;tre&s;s, the
King has ordered his General who is here al&s;o, to
give you all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he can, and to invite
you on Shore, to receive you with all po&s;&s;ible
Courte&s;y. Says <HI>William</HI> very quick upon him,
before I give thee an An&s;wer to that, I de&s;ire
thee to tell me what thou art; for by thy Speech
thou art an <HI>European.</HI> He an&s;wered pre&s;ently,
he was a <HI>Dutchman.</HI> That I know well, &s;ays <HI>Wil|liam,</HI>
by thy Speech; but art thou a Native <HI>Dutch|man</HI>
of <HI>Holland,</HI> or a Native of this Country, that
has learnt <HI>Dutch</HI> by conver&s;ing among the <HI>Hollan|ders,</HI>
who we know are &s;ettled upon this I&s;land.</P>
<P>No, <HI>&s;ays the Old Man,</HI> I am a Native of <HI>Delft</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Holland</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Well, &s;ays <HI>William</HI> immediately, but art thou
a Chri&s;tian or a Heathen, or what we call a

<P>Why let them tell the King, that we are

<PB N="280" REF="298">
his Offer of Civility to us, which, if we are far|ther

that at pre&s;ent we have no Occa&s;ion to come on
Shore: And be&s;ides, that we cannot &s;afely leave
the Ship in the pre&s;ent Condition &s;he is in, but
that we are obliged to take Care of her, in order
to get her off, and expect in a Tide or two more,
to get her quite clear, and at an Anchor.</P>

<PB N="282" REF="300">
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You put a Thought in my Head that
I will &s;peak to you about to Morrow.</P>
<P>Thus they went away, and <HI>William</HI> came on
board, and gave us a full Account of his Parley
with the old <HI>Dutchman,</HI> which was very diver|ting,
and to me in&s;tructing, for I had Abundance
of Rea&s;on to acknowledge <HI>William</HI> had made a
better Judgment of things than I.</P>
</SP>
<P>It was our good Fortune to get our Ship off
that very Night, and to bring her to an Anchor
at about a Mile and a Half further out, and in
deep Water, to our great Satisfaction; &s;o that
we had no need to fear the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s King with
his Hundred Thou&s;and Men; and indeed we had
&s;ome Sport with them the next Day, when they
came down, a va&s;t prodigious Multitude of them,
very few le&s;s in Number, in our Imagination,
than a Hundred Thou&s;and, with &s;ome Elephants;
tho' if it had been an Army of Elephants, they
could have done us no Harm, for we were fairly
at our Anchor now, and out of their Reach; and
indeed we thought our &s;elves more out of their
Reach, than we really were; and it was ten
Thou&s;and to One, that we had not been fa&s;t
a-ground again; for the Wind blowing off Shore,
tho' it made the Water &s;mooth where we lay,
yet it blew the Ebb further out than u&s;ual, and
we could ea&s;ily perceive the Sand which we
touch'd upon before, lay in the Shape of a Half
Moon, and &s;urrounded us with two Horns of it;
&s;o that we lay in the Middle or Center of it, as
in a round Bay, &s;afe ju&s;t as we were, and in deep
Water; but pre&s;ent Death, as it were, on the
right Hand, and on the left, for the two Horns,
<PB N="283" REF="301">
or Points of the Sand, reach'd out beyond where
our Ship lay near two Miles.</P>
<P>On that Part of the Sand which lay on our Ea&s;t
Side, this mi&s;guided Multitude extended them|&s;elves;
and being mo&s;t of them not above their
Knees, or mo&s;t of them not above Ancle deep
in the Water, they, as it were, &s;urrounded us on
that Side, and on the Side of the main Land,
and a little Way on the other Side of the Sand,
&s;tanding in a Half Circle, or rather three Fifths
of a Circle, for about &s;ix Miles in Length; the
other Horn, or Point of the Sand which lay on
our We&s;t Side being not quite &s;o &s;hallow, they
could not extend them&s;elves upon it &s;o far.</P>
<P>They little thought what Service they had
done us, and how unwillingly, and by the great|e&s;t
Ignorance, they had made them&s;elves Pilots to
us, while we having not &s;ounded the Place, might
have been lo&s;t, before we were aware. It is true,
we might have &s;ounded our new Harbour, before
we had ventured out; but I cannot &s;ay for cer|tain,
whether we &s;hould or not; for I, for my
Part, had not the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of what our real
Ca&s;e was. However, I &s;ay, perhaps before we
had weigh'd, we &s;hould have look'd about us a
little. I am &s;ure we ought to have done it; for
be&s;ides the&s;e Armies of human Furies, we had a
very leaky Ship, and all our Pumps could hardly
keep the Water from growing upon us, and our
Carpenters were over-board working to find out,
and &s;top the Wounds we had received, heeling
her fir&s;t on one Side, and then on the other; and
it was very diverting to &s;ee how, when our Men
heel'd the Ship over to the Side next the wild
Army that &s;tood on the Ea&s;t Horn of the Sand,
they were &s;o amazed between Fright and Joy,
<PB N="284" REF="302">
that it put them into a kind of Confu&s;ion, calling
to one another, hallooing and skreeking in a
Manner as it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>While we were doing this, for we were in a
great Hurry, you may be &s;ure, and all Hands at
Work, as well at the &s;topping our Leaks, as re|pairing
our Rigging and Sails, which had receiv'd
a great deal of Damage, and al&s;o in rigging a
new Main-Top-Ma&s;t, and the like: I &s;ay, while
we were doing all this, we perceived a Body of
Men, of near a Thou&s;and, move from that Part
of the Army of the Barbarians, that lay at the
Bottom of the &s;andy Bay, and came all along the
Water's Edge, round the Sand, till they &s;tood ju&s;t
on our Broad&s;ide <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and were within about
Half a Mile of us. Then we &s;aw the <HI>Dutchman</HI>
come forward nearer to us, and all alone, with
his white Flag and all his Motions, ju&s;t as before,
and there he &s;tood.</P>
<P>Our Men had but ju&s;t brought the Ship to
Rights again, as they came up to our Broad&s;ide,
and we had very happily found out and &s;topp'd
the wor&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous Leak that we had,
to our very great Satisfaction; &s;o I ordered the
Boats to be haul'd up, and Mann'd as they were
the Day before, and <HI>William</HI> to go as Plenipoten|tiary.
I would have gone my &s;elf, if I had under|&s;tood
<HI>Dutch;</HI> but as I did not, it was to no Pur|po&s;e,
for I &s;hould be able to know nothing of
what was &s;aid, but from him at &s;econd Hand,
which might be done as well afterwards. All the
In&s;tructions I pretended to give <HI>William,</HI> was, if
po&s;&s;ible, to get the old <HI>Dutchman</HI> away, and, if
he could, to make him come on board.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>William</HI> went ju&s;t as before; and when
he came within about &s;ixty or &s;eventy Yards of
<PB N="285" REF="303">
the Shore, he held up his white Flag, as the
<HI>Dutchman</HI> did, and turning the Boat's Broa&s;ide to
the Shore, and his Men lying upon their Oars,
the Parley or Dialogue began again thus.</P>

<P>Ju&s;t at this time our Ship fired three Guns, to
an&s;wer the Sloop, and let her know we &s;aw her,
who immediately, we perceived, under&s;tood it,
and &s;tood directly for the Place; but it is impo&s;&s;i|ble
to expre&s;s the Confu&s;ion and filthy vile Noi&s;e,
the Hurry and univer&s;al Di&s;order, that was
among that va&s;t Multitude of People, upon our
Firing of three Guns. They immediately all re|paired
to their Arms, as I may call it; for, to
&s;ay they put them&s;elves into Order, would be
&s;aying nothing.</P>
</SP>
<P>Upon the Word of Command then they ad|vanced
all in a Body to the Sea-&s;ide, and re&s;ol|ving
to give us one Volley of their Fire Arms,
for &s;uch they were, immediately they &s;aluted
us with a Hundred Thou&s;and of their Fire-Ar|rows,
every one carrying a little Bag of Cloath
dipt in Brim&s;tone, or &s;ome &s;uch thing; which
flying thro' the Air, had nothig to hinder it ta|king
Fire as it flew, and it generally did &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="307">
I cannot &s;ay but this Method of attacking us,
by a Way we had no Notion of, might give us at
fir&s;t &s;ome little Surprize; for the Number was &s;o
great at fir&s;t, that we were not altogether with|out
Apprehen&s;ions that they might unluckily &s;et
our Ship on Fire; &s;o that he re&s;olved immediately
to row on Board, and per&s;wade us all to weigh,
and &s;tand out to Sea; but there was no time for
it, for they immediately let fly a Volley at the
Boat, and at the Ship from all Parts of the va&s;t
Crowd of People which &s;tood near the Shore.</P>
<P>Nor did they fire, as I may call it, all at once,
and &s;o leave off; but their Arrows being &s;oon
notch'd upon their Bows, they kept continually
&s;hooting, &s;o that the Air was full of Flame.</P>
<P>I could not &s;ay whether they &s;et their Cotton
Rag on Fire before they &s;hot the Arrow, for I
did not perceive they had Fire with them, which
however it &s;eems they had. The Arrow, be&s;ides
the Fire it carried with it, had a Head, or a Peg,
as we call it, of a Bone, and &s;ome of &s;harp Flint
Stone; and &s;ome few of a Metal, too &s;oft in it&s;elf
for Metal, but hard enough to cau&s;e it to enter,
if it were a Plank, &s;o as to &s;tick where it fell.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> and his Men had Notice &s;ufficient to lye
clo&s;e behind their Wa&s;te-boards, which for this
very Purpo&s;e they had made &s;o high, that they
could ea&s;ily &s;ink them&s;elves behind them, &s;o as to
defend them&s;elves from any thing that came Point
blank, <HI>as we call it,</HI> or upon a Line; but for what
might fall perpendicular out of the Air, they had
no Guard, but took the Hazard of that. At fir&s;t
they made as if they would row away, but be|fore
they went, they gave a Volley of their
&s;mall Arms, firing at tho&s;e which &s;tood with the
<HI>Dutchman;</HI> but <HI>William</HI> ordered them to be &s;ure
<PB N="290" REF="308">
to take their Aim at others &s;o as to mi&s;s him,
and they did &s;o.</P>
<P>There was no Calling to them now, for the
Noi&s;e was &s;o great among them, that they could
hear no Body; but our Men boldlyrow'd in nearer
to them, for they were at fir&s;t driven a little off,
and when they came nearer, they fired a &s;econd
Volley, which put the Fellows into a great Con|fu&s;ion,
and we could &s;ee from the Ship, that &s;eve|ral
of them were killed or wounded.</P>
<P>We thought this was a very unequal Fight,
and therefore we made a Signal to our Men, to
row away, that we might have a little of the
Sport as well as they; but the Arrows flew &s;o
thick upon them, being &s;o near the Shore, that
they could not &s;it to their Oars; &s;o they &s;pread
a little of their Sail, thinking they might &s;ail
along the Shore, and lye behind their Wa&s;te|boards:
But the Sail had not been &s;pread &s;ix
Minutes, but it had five Hundred Fire-Arrows
&s;hot into it, and thro' it, and at length &s;et it
fairly on Fire; nor were our Men quite out of
the Danger of its &s;etting the Boat on Fire, and
this made them paddle and &s;hove the Boat away
as well as they could, as they lay, to get further
off.</P>
<P>By this time they had left us a fair Mark at the
whole Savage Army; and as we had &s;heer'd the
Ship as near to them as we could, we fired among
the thicke&s;t of them &s;ix or &s;even times, five Guns
at a time, which&s;hot old Iron, Mu&s;quet Bullets <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We could ea&s;ily &s;ee that we made Havock of
them, and killed and wounded Abundance of
them, and that they were in a great Surprize at
it; but yet they never offered to &s;tir, and all this
while their Fire-Arrows flew as thick as before.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="309">
At la&s;t, on a &s;udden their Arrows &s;topt, and
the old <HI>Dutchman</HI> came running down to the Wa|ter
Side, all alone, with his white Flag as before,
waving it as high as he could, and making Sig|nals
to our Boat to come to him again.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> did not care at fir&s;t to go near him, but
the Man continuing to make Signals to him to
come, at la&s;t <HI>William</HI> went, and the <HI>Dutchman</HI> told
him, that he had been with the General, who was
much mollified by the Slaughter of his Men, and
that now he could have any thing of him.</P>
<P>Any thing, &s;ays <HI>William,</HI> what have we to do
with him? Let him go about his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
carry his Men out of Gun-Shot: Can't he?</P>
<P>Why, &s;ays the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> but he dares not &s;tir,
nor &s;ee the King's Face; unle&s;s &s;ome of your
Men come on Shore, he will certainly put him to
Death.</P>
<P>Why then, &s;ays <HI>William,</HI> he is a dead Man; for
if it were to &s;ave his Life, and the Lives of all
the Crowd that is with him, he &s;hall never have
one of us in his Power.</P>
<P>But I'll tell thee, &s;aid <HI>William,</HI> how thou &s;halt
cheat him, and gain thy own Liberty too, if thou
ha&s;t any Mind to &s;ee thy own Country again, and
art not turn'd Savage, and grown fond of living
all thy Days among Heathens and Savages.</P>
<P>I would be glad to do it with all my Heart,
&s;ays he; but if I &s;hould offer to &s;wim off to you
now, tho' they are &s;o far from me, they &s;hoot &s;o
true, that they would kill me before I got half
Way.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays <HI>William,</HI> I'll tell thee how thou &s;halt
come with his Con&s;ent; go to him, and tell him,
I have offer'd to carry you on board, to try if you
could per&s;wade the Captain to come on Shore,
<PB N="292" REF="310">
and that I would not hinder him, if he was wil|ling
to venture.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutchman</HI> &s;eem'd in a Rapture at the very
fir&s;t Word: I'll do it, &s;ays he, I am per&s;waded
he will give me Leave to come.</P>
<P>Away he runs, as if he had a glad Me&s;&s;age to
carry, and tells the General, that <HI>William</HI> had pro|mi&s;ed,
if he would go on board the Ship with me,
he would per&s;wade the Captain to return with him.
The General was Fool enough to give him Order
to go, and charg'd him not to come back without
the Captain, which he readily promi&s;ed, and ve|ry
hone&s;tly might.</P>
<P>So they took him in, and brought him on board,
and he was as good as his Word to them, for he
never went back to them any more; and the
Sloop being come to the Mouth of the Inlet where
we lay, we weighed, and &s;et Sail. But as we
went out, being pretty near the Shore, we fired
three Guns as it were among them, but without
any Shot, for it was of no U&s;e to us, to hurt any
more of them. After we had fired, we gave them
a Chear, as the Seamen call it; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> we
halloo'd at them by way of Triumph, and &s;o car|ried
off their Amba&s;&s;$dor; how it fared with
their General, we know nothing of that.</P>
<P>This Pa&s;&s;age, when I related it to a Friend of
mine, after my Return from tho&s;e Rambles, agreed
&s;o well with his Relation of what happened to one
Mr. <HI>Knox,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain, who &s;ome time ago
was decoyed on Shore by tho&s;e People, that it
could not but be very much to my Satisfaction to
think what Mi&s;chief we had all e&s;caped; and I
think it cannot but be very profitable to record
the other Story, <HI>which is but &s;hort,</HI> with my own,
to &s;hew, whoever reads this, what it was I avoided,
<PB N="293" REF="311">
and prevent their falling into the like, if they
have to do with the perfidious People of <HI>Ceylon.</HI>
The Relation is as follows.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon</HI> being inhabited for the
greate&s;t Part by Barbarians, which will not allow
any Trade or Commerce with any <HI>European</HI> Na|tion,
and inacce&s;&s;ible by any Travellers, it will
be convenient to relate the Occa&s;ion how the Au|thor
of this Story happen'd to go into this
I&s;land, and what Opportunities he had of being
fully acquainted with the People, their Laws and
Cu&s;toms, that &s;o we may the better depend upon
the Account, and value it as it de&s;erves, for the
Rarity as well as the Truth of it; and both the&s;e
the Author gives us a brief Relation of, in this
Manner. His Words are as follows.</P>
<P>In the Year 1657, the <HI>Anne</HI> Fregat, of <HI>London,</HI>
Captain <HI>Robert Knox</HI> Commander, on the 21&s;t of
<HI>January,</HI> &s;et Sail out of the <HI>Downes,</HI> in the Service
of the Honourable the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company of
<HI>England,</HI> bound for <HI>Fort St. George</HI> upon the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> to trade for one Year from Port
to Port in <HI>India;</HI> which having performed, as he
was lading his Goods to return for <HI>England,</HI> be|ing
in the Road of <HI>Matlipatam,</HI> on the 19th of
<HI>November</HI> 1659, there happen'd &s;uch a mighty
Storm, that in it &s;everal Ships were ca&s;t away,
and he was forc'd to cut his Main Ma&s;t by the
Board, which &s;o di&s;abled the Ship, that he could
not proceed in his Voyage; whereupon, <HI>Cotiar,</HI>
in the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon</HI> being a very commodious
Bay fit for her pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Thomas Cham|bers,</HI>
E&s;&abque; &s;ince Sir <HI>Thomas Chambers,</HI> the Agent at
<HI>Fort St. George,</HI> ordered that the Ship &s;hould take
<PB N="294" REF="312">
in &s;ome Cloath and <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants belonging
to <HI>Porta Nova,</HI> who might trade there while &s;he
lay to &s;et her Ma&s;t, and repair the other Dama|ges
&s;u&s;tained by the Storm. At her fir&s;t coming
thither, after the <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants were &s;et on
Shore, the Captain and his Men were very jea|lous
of the People of the Place, by rea&s;on the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> never had any Commerce or Dealing with
them; but after they had been there twenty Days,
going a&s;hore and returning again at Plea&s;ure,
without any Mole&s;tation, they began to lay a&s;ide
all &s;u&s;picious Thoughts of the People that dwelt
thereabouts, who had kindly entertained them
for their Money.</P>
<P>By this time the King of the Country had No|tice
of their Arrival, and not being acquainted
with their Intents, he &s;ent down a <HI>Di&s;&s;uava,</HI> or
General, with an Army to them, who immedi|ately
&s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to the Captain on board,
to de&s;ire him to come a&s;hore to him, pretending
a Letter from the King. The Captain &s;aluted
the Me&s;&s;age with Firing of Guns, and ordered
his Son <HI>Robert Knox,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Loveland,</HI> Mer|chant
of the Ship, to go a&s;hore and wait on him.
When they were come before him, he demanded
<HI>Who they were, and how long they &s;hould &s;tay?</HI> They
told him, <HI>They were</HI> Engli&s;hmen, <HI>and not to &s;tay
above twenty or thirty Days, and de&s;ired Permi&s;&s;ion to
trade in his Maje&s;ty's Port.</HI> His An&s;wer was, <HI>That
the King was glad to hear that the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>were come
into his Country, and had commanded him to a&s;&s;i&s;t them,
as they &s;hould de&s;ire, and had &s;ent a Letter to be de|livered
to none but the Captain him&s;elf.</HI> They were
then twelve Miles from the Sea-Side, and there|fore
replied, <HI>That the Captain could not leave his Ship
to come &s;o far; but if he plea&s;ed to go down to the
<PB N="295" REF="313">
Sea-Side, the Captain would wait on him to receive the
Letter.</HI> Whereupon the <HI>Di&s;&s;uava</HI> de&s;ired them
to &s;tay that Day, and on the Morrow he would go
with them; which, rather than di&s;plea&s;e him in
&s;o &s;mall a Matter, they con&s;ented to. In the
Evening, the <HI>Di&s;&s;uava</HI> &s;ent a Pre&s;ent to the Cap|tain
of Cattle and Fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which being car|ried
all Night by the Me&s;&s;engers, was delivered
to him in the Morning, who told him withal,
that his Men were coming down with the <HI>Di&s;&s;ua|va,</HI>
and de&s;ired his Company on Shore again&s;t his
coming, having a Letter from the King to deliver
into his own Hand. The Captain mi&s;tru&s;ting
nothing, came on Shore with his Boat, and &s;it|ting
under a Tamarind Tree, waited for the
<HI>Di&s;&s;uava.</HI> In the mean time, the Native Soldiers
privately &s;urrounded him and the &s;even Men he
had with him, and &s;eizing them, carrried them
to meet the <HI>Di&s;&s;uava,</HI> bearing the Captain on a
Hammock on their Shoulders.</P>
<P>The next Day the Long-Boat's Crew, not know|ing
what had happen'd, came on Shore to cut
down a Tree to make Cheeks for the Main-Ma&s;t,
and were made Pri&s;oners after the &s;ame Man|ner,
tho' with more Violence, becau&s;e they were
more rough with them, and made Re&s;i&s;tance, yet
they were not brought to the Captain and his
Company, but quarter'd in another Hou&s;e in the
&s;ame Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;&s;uava</HI> having thus gotten two Boats,
and eighteen Men, his next Care was to gain the
Ship, and, to that End, telling the Captain that
he and his Men were only detained becau&s;e the
King intended to &s;end Letters and a Pre&s;ent to
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation by him, de&s;ired he would
&s;end &s;ome Men on board his Ship to order her
<PB N="296" REF="314">
Stay; and becau&s;e the Ship was in Danger of
being fired by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> if &s;he &s;tay'd long in
the Bay, to bring her up the River. The Cap|tain
did not approve of the Advice, but did not
dare own his Di&s;like; and &s;o &s;ent his Son with
the Order, but with a &s;olemn Conjuration to
return again, which he accordingly did, bring|ing
a Letter from the Company in the Ship,
<HI>That they would not obey the Captain, nor any other in
this Matter, but were re&s;olved to &s;tand on their own
Defence.</HI> This Letter &s;atisfied the <HI>Di&s;&s;uava,</HI> who
thereupon gave the Captain Leave to write for
what he would have brought him from the
Ship, pretending, that he had not the King's
Order to relea&s;e them, though it would &s;ud|denly
come.</P>
<P>The Captain &s;eeing he was held in Su&s;pen&s;e,
and the Sea&s;on of the Year &s;pending for the Ship
to proceed on her Voyage to &s;ome Place, &s;ent
Order to Mr. <HI>John Bur$ord</HI> the chief Mate, to
take Charge of the Ship, and &s;et Sail to <HI>Porta
Nova,</HI> from whence they came, and there to
follow the Agent's Order.</P>
<P>And now began that long and &s;ad Captivity
they all along feared; the Ship being gone, the
<HI>Di&s;&s;uava</HI> was called up to the King, and they
were kept under Guards a while, till a &s;pecial
Order came from the King to part them, and
put one in a Town, for the Conveniency of
their Maintenance, which the King ordered to
be at the Charge of the Country. On <HI>September,</HI>
16, 1660, the Captain and his Son were placed
in a Town called <HI>Bonder Coo&s;wat,</HI> in the Country
of <HI>Hotcurly,</HI> di&s;tant from the City of <HI>Candi</HI>
Northward thirty Miles, and, from the re&s;t of
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a full Day's Journey. Here they had
<PB N="297" REF="315">
their Provi&s;ions brought them twice a Day,
without Money, &s;o much as they could eat, and
as good as the Country yielded. The Situation of
the Place was very plea&s;ant and commodious, but
that Year that Part of the Land was very &s;ickly
by Agues and Fevers, of which many died.
The Captain and his Son, after &s;ome time, were
vi&s;ited with the common Di&s;temper, and the
Captain being al&s;o loaded with Grief for his
deplorable Condition, langui&s;h'd more than three
Months, and then died, <HI>February</HI> the 9th 1660.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Knox</HI> his Son being now left de&s;olate,
&s;ick, and in Captivity, having none to comfort
him but God, who is the Father of the father|le&s;s,
and hears the Groans of &s;uch as are in
Captivity, being alone to enter upon a long
Scene of Mi&s;ery and Calamity, oppre&s;s'd with
Weakne&s;s of Body and Grief of Soul, for the
Lo&s;s of his Father, and his remedile&s;s Trouble
that he was like to endure; and the fir&s;t In|&s;tance
of it was in the Burial of his Father: For
he &s;ent his Black Boy to the People of the
Town, to de&s;ire their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e they
under&s;tood not their Language; but they &s;ent
him only a Rope to drag him by the Neck into
the Woods, and told him, <HI>that they would offer
him no other Help unle&s;s he would pay for it.</HI> This
barbarous An&s;wer increa&s;ed his Trouble, for
his Father's Death, that now he was like to lye
unburied, and be made a Prey to the wild Bea&s;ts
in the Woods; for the Ground was very hard,
and they had not Tools to dig with, and &s;o it was
impo&s;&s;ible for them to bury him; but having
a &s;mall Matter of Money left him, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Pagoda,</HI>
and a Gold Ring, he hired a Man, and &s;o buried
<PB N="298" REF="316">
him in as decent a Manner as their Condition
would permit.</P>
<P>His dead Father being thus removed out of
his Sight, but his Ague continuing, he was re|duced
very low, partly by Sorrow, and partly
by his Di&s;ea&s;e; all the Comfort he had, was to
go into the Wood, and Fields with a Book,
either the <HI>Practice of Piety,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Roger</HI>'s <HI>Seven
Treati&s;es,</HI> which were the only two Books he
had, and meditate and read, and &s;ometimes pray,
in which, his Angui&s;h made him often
invert <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Petition, <HI>That he might die,</HI> becau&s;e
his Life was a burthen to him. God, tho' he
was plea&s;ed to prolong his Life, yet he found
a Way to lighten his Grief, by removing his Ague,
and granting him a De&s;ire, which above all
things, was acceptable to him. He had read his
two Books over &s;o often, that he had both al|mo&s;t
by Heart, and tho' they were both pious
and good Writings, yet he long'd for the Truth
from the original Fountain, and thought it his
greate&s;t Unhappine&s;s, that he had not a Bible,
and did believe, that he &s;hould never &s;ee one
again: But, contrary to his Expectation, God
brought him one after this Manner. As he was
fi&s;hing one Day, with his Black Boy, to catch
&s;ome Fi&s;h to relieve his Hunger, an old Man
pa&s;s'd by them, and asked his Boy, whether his
Ma&s;ter could read; and when the Boy had an|&s;wered,
<HI>Yes;</HI> he told him, <HI>that he had gotten a
Book from the</HI> Portugue&s;e <HI>when they left</HI> Columbo;
<HI>and, if his Ma&s;ter plea&s;ed, he would &s;ell it him.</HI> The
Boy told his Ma&s;ter, who bad him go and &s;ee
what Book it was. The Boy having &s;erved the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ome time, knew the Book, and, as &s;oon
<PB N="299" REF="317">
as he had got it into his Hand, came running to
him, calling out before he came to him, '<HI>Tis the
Bible.</HI> The Words &s;tartled him, and he flung
down his Angle to meet him, and, finding it true,
was mightily rejoyc'd to &s;ee it; but he was a|fraid
he &s;hould not have enough to purcha&s;e it,
tho' he was re&s;olved to part with all the Money
he had, which was but one <HI>Pagoda,</HI> to buy it;
but, his Black Boy per&s;wading him to &s;light it;
and leave it to him to buy it, he at length, ob|tained
it for a knit Cap.</P>
<P>This Accident he could not but look upon as
a great Miracle, that God &s;hould be&s;tow upon
him &s;uch an extraordinary Ble&s;&s;ing, and bring
him a Bible in his own native Language, in &s;uch
a remote Part of the World, where his Name
was not known, and where it was never heard
of, that an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> had ever been before. The
Enjoyment of this Mercy was a great Comfort
to him in his Captivity, and tho' he wanted no
bodily Convenience that the Country did afford,
for the King immediately after his Father's
Death had &s;ent an expre&s;s Order to the Peo|ple
of the Town, that they &s;hould be kind to
him, and give him good Victuals; and, after
he had been &s;ome time in the Country, and un|der&s;tood
the Language, he got him good Conve|niencies,
as, a Hor&s;e and Gardens, and falling
to Husbandry, God &s;o pro&s;pered him, that he
had Plenty, not only for him&s;elf, but to lend
others; which being according to the Cu&s;tom
of the Country, at 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> a Year, much
enriched him. He had al&s;o Goats, which &s;erved
him for Mutton, and Hogs and Hens: Notwith|&s;tanding
this, I &s;ay, for he lived as fine as any
of their Noblemen, he could not &s;o far forget
<PB N="300" REF="318">
his native Country, as to be contented to dwell
in a &s;trange Land, where there was to him a
Famine of God's Word and Sacraments, the
Want of which made all other things to be of lit|tle
Value to him; therefore, as he made it his
daily and fervent Prayer to God, in his good
time, to re&s;tore him to both, &s;o at length he,
with one <HI>Stephen Rutland,</HI> who had lived with him
two Years before, re&s;olved to make their E&s;cape,
and, about the Year 1673, meditated all &s;ecret
Ways to compa&s;s it. They had before taken
up a Way of Peddling about the Country,
and buying Tobacco, Pepper, Garlick, Combs,
and all &s;orts of Iron-Ware, and carried them into
tho&s;e Parts of the Country where they want|ed
them; and now, to promote their De&s;ign,
as they went with their Commodities from
Place to Place, they di&s;cour&s;ed with the
Country People, <HI>for they could now &s;peak their
Language well,</HI> concerning the Ways and Inhabi|tants
where the I&s;le was thinne&s;t and fulle&s;t inha|bited;
where and how the Watches lay from
one Country to another; and what Commodities
were proper for them to carry into all Parts;
pretending, that they would furni&s;h them&s;elves
with &s;uch Wares as the re&s;pective Places wanted.
None doubted but what they did was upon the
Account of Trade, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> was &s;o well
&s;eated, and could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to leave &s;uch
an E&s;tate, was by travelling Northward, be|cau&s;e
that Part of the Land was lea&s;t inhabited;
and &s;o furni&s;hing them&s;elves with &s;uch Wares
as were vendible in tho&s;e Parts, they &s;et forth,
and &s;teered their Cour&s;e towards the North
Part of the I&s;land, knowing very little of the
Ways, which were generally intricate and per|plexed,
<PB N="301" REF="319">
becau&s;e they have no publick Roads,
but a Multitude of little Paths from one Town
to another, and tho&s;e often changing; and for
White Men to enquire about the Ways, was very
dangerous, becau&s;e the People would pre&s;ently
&s;u&s;pect their De&s;ign.</P>
<P>At this Time they travelled from <HI>Canda &V;da,</HI>
as far as the Country of <HI>Neurecalava,</HI> which is in
the furthermo&s;t Parts of the King's Dominions,
and about three Days Journey from their
Dwelling. They were very thankful to Provi|dence
that they had pa&s;&s;ed all Difficulties &s;o far;
but yet dur&s;t not go any further, becau&s;e they
had no Wares left to Traffick with; and it being
the fir&s;t time they had been ab&s;ent &s;o long
from home, they feared the Town&s;men would
come after them to &s;eek for them, and &s;o they
returned home, and went eight or ten times into
tho&s;e Parts with their Wares, till they became
well acquainted both with the People and the
Paths.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Parts Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> met his black Boy,
whom he had turned away divers Years before.
He had now got a Wife and Children, and was
very poor; but being acquainted with the&s;e Quar|ters,
he not only took Directions of him, but
agreed with him for a good Reward, to conduct
him and his Companion to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> He glad|ly
undertook it, and a Time was appointed be|tween
them; but Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> being di&s;abled by a
grievous Pain which &s;eized him on his right Side,
and held him five Days, that he could not travel,
this Appointment proved in vain; for tho' he
went as &s;oon as he was well, his Guide was gone
into another Country about his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and they
dur&s;t not at that time venture to run away with|out
<PB N="302" REF="320">
him. The&s;e Attempts took up eight or nine
Years, various Accidents hindring their De&s;igns,
but mo&s;t commonly the dry Weather, becau&s;e
they fear'd, in the Woods, they &s;hould be &s;tarv'd
with Thir&s;t, all the Country being in &s;uch a Con|dition
almo&s;t four or five Years together for Lack
of Rain.</P>
<P>On <HI>September</HI> 22. 1679, they &s;et forth again,
furni&s;hed with Knives and &s;mall Axes, for their
Defence, becau&s;e they could carry them private|ly,
and &s;end all Sorts of Wares to &s;ell, as for|merly,
and all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions, the Moon
being twenty &s;even Days old, that they might have
Light to run away by, to try what Succe&s;s God
Almighty would now give them, in &s;eeking their
Liberty. Their fir&s;t Stage was to <HI>Anarodgburro,</HI>
in the Way to which lay a Wilderne&s;s, called
<HI>Parraoth Mocolane,</HI> full of wild Elephants, Ty|gers,
and Bears; and becau&s;e 'tis the utmo&s;t
Confines of the King's Dominions, there is al|ways
a Watch kept.</P>
<P>In the Middle of the Way, they heard that
the Governour's Officers of the&s;e Parts were out
to gather up the King's Revenues and Duties,
to &s;end them up to the City; which put them
into no &s;mall Fear, le&s;t finding them, they &s;hould
&s;end them back again: Whereupon they with|drew
to the We&s;tern Parts of <HI>Ecpoulpot,</HI> and &s;at
down to Knitting, till they heard they Officers
were gone. As &s;oon as they were departed, they
went onwards of their Journey, having got a
good Parcel of Cotton Yarn to knit Caps with,
and having kept their Wares, as they pretended,
to exchange for dried Fi&s;h, which was &s;old only
in tho&s;e lower Parts. Their Way lay nece&s;&s;ari|ly
thro' the Governour's Yard at <HI>Collinilla,</HI> who
<PB N="303" REF="321">
dwells there on Purpo&s;e to examine all that go
and come. This greatly di&s;tre&s;s'd them, becau&s;e
he would ea&s;ily &s;u&s;pect they were out of their
Bounds, being Captives; however, they went re|&s;olutely
to his Hou&s;e, and meeting him, pre&s;en|ted
him with a &s;mall Parcel of Tobacco and Be|tel;
and &s;hewing him their Wares, told him, they
came to get dried Fle&s;h to carry back with them.
The Governour did not &s;u&s;pect them, but told
them, he was &s;orry they came in &s;o dry a Time,
when no Deer could be catched, but if &s;ome Rain
fell, he would &s;oon &s;upply them. This An&s;wer
plea&s;ed them, and they &s;eemed contented to &s;tay;
and accordingly abiding with him two or three
Days, and no Rain falling, they pre&s;ented the Go|vernour
with five or &s;ix Charges of Gunpowder,
which is a Rarity among them; and leaving a Bun|dle
at his Hou&s;e, they de&s;ired him to &s;hoot them
&s;ome Deer, while they made a Step to <HI>Anarodg|burro.</HI>
Here al&s;o they were put in a great Fright,
by the coming of certain Soldiers from the King
to the Governour, to give him Orders to &s;et a
&s;ecure Guard at the Watches, that no &s;u&s;picious
Per&s;ons might pa&s;s; which, tho' it was only in|tended
to prevent the Flight of the Relations of
certain Nobles whom the King had clapt up; yet
they feared they might wonder to &s;ee white Men
here, and &s;o &s;end them back again: But God &s;o
ordered it, that they were very kind to them, and
left them to their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o they got &s;afe
to <HI>Anarodgburro.</HI> Their Pretence was dried Fle&s;h,
tho' they knew there was none to be had; but
their real Bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;earch the Way down to
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which they &s;taid three Days to do: But
finding, that in the Way to <HI>Ja&s;napatan,</HI> which is
one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ports, there was a Watch which
<PB N="304" REF="322">
could hardly be pa&s;s'd, and other Inconveniencies
not &s;urmountable, they re&s;olved to go back, and
take the River <HI>Malwatogah,</HI> which they had before
judged would be a probable Guide to lead them to
the Sea; and that they might not be pur&s;ued, left
<HI>Anarodgburro</HI> ju&s;t at Night, when the People never
travel for fear of wild Bea&s;ts. On <HI>Sunday, Oct.</HI> 12.
being &s;tored with all things needful for their Jour|ney,
<HI>viz.</HI> Ten Days Provi&s;ion, a Ba&s;in to boil their
Provi&s;ion in, two Calaba&s;hes to fetch Water in,
and two great Tallipat Leaves for Tents, with
Jaggory, Sweet-meats, Tobacco, Betell, Tinder-Boxes,
and a Deer-Skin for Shoes, to keep their
Feet from Thorns, becau&s;e to them they chiefly
tru&s;ted. Being come to the River, they &s;truck
into the Woods, and kept by the Side of it; yet
not going on the Sand, le&s;t their Foot&s;teps &s;hould
be di&s;cerned, unle&s;s forced, and then going
backwards.</P>
<P>Being gotten a good Way into the Wood, it be|gan
to rain; wherefore they erected their Tents,
made a Fire, and refre&s;h'd them&s;elves again&s;t the
Ri&s;ing of the Moon, which was then eighteen
Days old; and having tied Deer-Skins about their
Feet, and ea&s;ed them&s;elves of their Wares, they
proceeded in their Journey. When they had tra|velled
three or four Hours with Difficulty, be|cau&s;e
the Moon gave but little Light among the
thick Trees, they found an Elephant in their Way
before them, and becau&s;e they could not &s;care him
away, they were forced to &s;tay till Morning; and
&s;o they kindled a Fire, and took a Pipe of Tobac|co.
By the Light they could not di&s;cern that ever
any Body had been there, nothing being to be &s;een
but Woods, and &s;o they were in great Hopes that
they were pa&s;t all Danger, being beyond all Inha|bitants;
<PB N="305" REF="323">
but they were mi&s;taken; for the River
winding Northward, brought them into the mid&s;t
of a Parcel of Towns, called <HI>Ti&s;&s;ea Wava,</HI> where
being in Danger of being &s;een, they were under
a mighty Terror for had the People found them,
they would have beat them, and &s;ent them up to
the King) and to avoid it, they crept into an
hollow Tree, and &s;at there in Mud and Wet, till
it began to grow dark, and then betaking them|&s;elves
to their Legs, travell'd till the Darkne&s;s of
Night &s;top them. They heard Voices behind
them, and feared 'twas &s;omebody in Pur&s;uit of
them; but at length di&s;cerning it was only an
Hallooing to keep the wild Bea&s;ts out of the
Corn, they pitched their Tents by the River,
and having boiled Rice, and roa&s;ted Meat for
their Suppers, and &s;atisfied their Hungers, they
committed them&s;elves to God's Keeping, and laid
them down to Sleep.</P>
<P>The next Morning, to prevent the wor&s;t, they
got up early, and ha&s;ten'd on their Journey; and
tho' they were now got out of all Danger of the
tame <HI>Chiangulays,</HI> they were in great Danger of the
wild ones, of whom tho&s;e Woods were full; and
though they &s;aw their Tents, yet they were all
gone, &s;ince the Rains had fallen, from the River
into the Woods; and &s;o God kept them from that
Danger, for had they met the wild Men, they
had been &s;hot.</P>
<P>Thus they travelled from Morning to Night
&s;everal Days, thro' Bu&s;hes and Thorns, which
made their Arms and Shoulders, which were na|ked,
all of a Gore Blood. They often met with
Bears, Hogs, Deer, and wild Buffloes, but they
all run away as &s;oon as they &s;aw them. The
River was exceeding full of Alligat$$s. In the
<PB N="306" REF="324">
Evening they u&s;ed to pitch their Tents, and make
great Fires both before and behind them, to af|fright
the wild Bea&s;ts, and tho' they heard the
Voices of all &s;orts, they &s;aw none.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> at Noon they cro&s;s'd the River
<HI>Coronda Oya,</HI> which parts the Country of the <HI>Ma|labars</HI>
from the King's, and on <HI>Friday</HI> about Nine
or Ten in the Morning, came among the Inhabi|tants,
of whom they were as much afraid as of
the <HI>Chiangulays</HI> before; for tho' the <HI>Wanniounay,</HI> or
Prince of this People, payeth Tribute to the
<HI>Dutch</HI> out of Fear, yet he is better affected to the
King of <HI>Candi,</HI> and if he had took them, would
have &s;ent them up to their old Ma&s;ter; but not
knowing any Way to e&s;cape, they kept on their
Journey by the River Side by Day, becau&s;e the
Woods were not to be travell'd by Night, for
Thorns and wild Bea&s;ts, who came down then to
the River to drink. In all the <HI>Malabars</HI> Country
they met with only two Bramans, who treated
them civilly, and for their Money one of them
conducted them till they came into the Territories
of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and out of all Danger from the King
of <HI>Candi,</HI> which did not a little rejoice them; but
yet they were in no &s;mall Trouble how to find the
Way out of the Woods, till a <HI>Malabar</HI> for the Lu|cre
of a Knife, conducted them to a <HI>Dutch</HI> Town,
where they found Guides to conduct them from
Town to Town, till they came to the Fort called
<HI>Arepa,</HI> where they arrived <HI>Saturday, October</HI> 18.
1679, and there thankfully ador'd God's wonder|ful
Providence, in thus compleating their Deli|verance
from a long Captivity of Nineteen Years
and &s;ix Months.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="325">
I come now back to my own Hi&s;tory, which
draws near a Conclu&s;ion, as to the Travels
I took in this Part of the World. We were now
at Sea, and we &s;tood away to the North for a
while, to try if we could get a Market for
our Spice, for we were very rich in Nutmegs,
but we ill knew what to do with them; we dur&s;t
not go upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, or, to &s;peak
more properly, among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factories to
Trade; not that we were afraid to fight any two
Ships they had; and be&s;ides that, we knew,
that as they had no Letters of Mart or of Re|pri&s;als
from the Government, &s;o it was none
of their Bu&s;ine&s;s to act offen&s;ively, no not tho'
we were Pyrates. Indeed if we had made any
Attempt upon them, they might have ju&s;tify'd
them&s;elves in joining together to re&s;i&s;t, and
a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another to defend them&s;elves; but
to go out of their Bu&s;ine&s;s to attack a Pyrate
Ship of almo&s;t fifty Guns, as we were, it was
plain, that it was none of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
con&s;equently it was none of our Concern, &s;o we
did not trouble our &s;elves about it; but, on the
other Hand, it was none of our Bu&s;ine&s;s to be
&s;een among them, and to have the News of us
carried from one Factory to another: So that
whatever De&s;ign we might be upon at another
Time, we &s;hould be &s;ure to be prevented and di&s;|covered:
Much le&s;s had we any Occa&s;ion to be
&s;een among the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factories, upon the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Malabar;</HI> for, being fully loaden with the Spi|ces
which we had in the Sen&s;e of their Trade
plundered them of, it would &s;oon have told them
what we were, and all that we had been doing,
and they would, no doubt, have concerned them|&s;elves
all manner of Ways to have fallen upon us.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="326">
The only Way we had for it was to &s;tand away for
<HI>Goa,</HI> and Trade, if we could, for our Spices with the
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Factory there. Accordingly we &s;ailed
almo&s;t thither, for we had made Land two Days
before, and, being in the Latitude of <HI>Goa,</HI> were
&s;tanding in fair for <HI>Marmagoon,</HI> on the Head of <HI>Sal|&s;at,</HI>
at the going up to <HI>Goa,</HI> when I called to the Man
at the Helm to bring the Ship to, and bid the Pilot
go away N. N. W. till we came out of Sight of the
Shore; when <HI>William</HI> and I called a Council as we
u&s;ed to do upon Emergences, what Cour&s;e we
&s;hould take to trade there, and not be di&s;covered;
and we concluded, at length, that we would not
go thither at all; but that <HI>William,</HI> with &s;uch
tru&s;ty Fellows only as could be depended upon,
&s;hould go in the Sloop to <HI>Surat,</HI> which was &s;till
farther Northward, and trade there as Mer|chants,
with &s;uch of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory as they
could find to be for their Turn.</P>
<P>To carry this with the more Caution, and &s;o
as not to be &s;u&s;pected, we agreed to take out all
her Guns, and to put &s;uch Men into her, and
no other, as would promi&s;e us not to de&s;ire or
offer to go on Shore, or to enter into any Talk
or Conver&s;ation with any that might come on
board: And to fini&s;h the Di&s;gui&s;e to our Mind,
<HI>William</HI> documented two of our Men, one a Sur|geon,
as he him&s;elf was, and the other a ready-witted
Fellow, an old Sailor, that had been a
Pilot upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-England,</HI> and was
an excellent Mimick; the&s;e two <HI>William</HI> dre&s;&s;ed
up like two Quakers, and made them talk like
&s;uch. The old Pilot he made go Captain of the
Sloop, and the Surgeon for Doctor, as he was,
and him&s;elf Super-Cargo: In this Figure, and
the Sloop all plain, no curled Work upon her,
<PB N="309" REF="327">
indeed &s;he had not much before, and no Guns
to be &s;een, away he went for <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould indeed have ob&s;erved, that we went,
&s;ome Days before we parted, to a &s;mall &s;andy
I&s;land, clo&s;e under the Shore, where there was
a good Cove of deep Water, like a Road, and
out of Sight of any of the Factories, which are
here very thick upon the Coa&s;t. Here we &s;hift|ed
the Loading of the Sloop, and put into her
&s;uch Things only as we had a mind to di&s;|po&s;e
of there, which was indeed little but Nut|megs
and Cloves, but chiefly the former; and
from thence <HI>William</HI> and his two Quakers, with
about eighteen Men in the Sloop, went away to
<HI>Surat,</HI> and came to an Anchor at a Di&s;tance from
the Factory.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> u&s;ed &s;uch Caution, that he fond
Means to go on Shore him&s;elf, and the Doctor, as
he called him, in a Boat, which came on board
them to &s;ell Fi&s;h, rowed with only <HI>Indians</HI> of the
Country, which Boat he afterwards hired to
carry him on board again. It was not long
that they were on Shore, but that they found
Means to get Acquaintance with &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h|men,</HI>
who though they lived there, and per|haps,
were the Company's Servants at fir&s;t,
yet appeared then to be Traders for them&s;elves,
in whatever Coa&s;t-Bu&s;ine&s;s e&s;pecially came in
their Way, and the Doctor was made the fir&s;t
to pick Acquaintance; &s;o he recommended his
Friend, the Super-Cargo, till, by Degrees, the
Merchants were as found of the Bargain as our
Men were of the Merchants, only that the Cargo
was a little too much for them.</P>
<P>However, this did not prove a Difficulty long
with them; for the next Day they brought two
<PB N="310" REF="328">
more Merchants, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> al&s;o, into their Bargain;
and, as <HI>William</HI> could perceive by their Di&s;|cor&s;e,
they re&s;olved, if they bought them,
to carry them to the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> upon their
own Accounts; <HI>William</HI> took the Hint, and, as
he told me afterwards, concluded we might
carry them there as well as they; but this was
not <HI>William</HI>'s pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s; he had here no le&s;s
than three and thirty Ton of Nuts, and eighteen
Ton of Cloves. There was a good Quantity of
Mace among the Nutmegs; but we did not
&s;tand to make much Allowance. In &s;hort, they
bargained, and the Merchants, who would
gladly have bought Sloop and all, gave <HI>William</HI>
Directions, and two Men for Pilots, to go to a
Creek about &s;ix Leagues from the Factory,
where they brought Boats, and unloaded the
whole Cargo, and paid <HI>William</HI> very hone&s;tly
for it. The whole Parcel amounting, in Money,
to about thirty five thou&s;and Pieces of Eight,
be&s;ides &s;ome Goods of Value, which <HI>William</HI> was
content to take, and two large Diamonds worth
about three Hundred Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>When they paid the Money, <HI>William</HI> invited
them on board the Sloop, where they came, and
the merry old Quaker diverted them exceeding|ly
with his Talk, and <HI>Thee'd</HI> 'em, and <HI>Thou'd</HI> 'em,
till he made 'em &s;o drunk, that they could not go
on Shore for that Night.</P>
<P>They would fain have known who our People
were, and whence they came, but not a Man in
the Sloop would an&s;wer them to any Que&s;tion
they ask'd, but in &s;uch a Manner as let them
think them&s;elves banter'd and je&s;ted with. How|ever,
in Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>William</HI> &s;aid, they were able
Men for any Cargo we could have brought them,
<PB N="311" REF="329">
and that they would have bought twice as much
Spice if we had had it. He ordered the merry
Captain to tell them, that they had another
Sloop that lay at <HI>Marmagoon,</HI> and that had a great
Quantity of Spice on board al&s;o; and that if it
was not &s;old when he went back, for that thither
he was bound, he would bring her up.</P>
<P>Their new Chaps were &s;o eager, that they
would have bargain'd with the old Captain be|fore-hand:
Nay Friend, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I will not trade
with thee un&s;ight and un&s;een; neither do I know
whether the Ma&s;ter of the Sloop may not have
&s;old his Loading already to &s;ome Merchants of
<HI>Sal&s;et;</HI> but if he has not, when I come to him, I
think to bring him up to thee.</P>
<P>The Doctor had his Employment all this
while, as well as <HI>William</HI> and the old Captain; for
he went on &s;hore &s;everal Times a Day in the <HI>In|dian</HI>
Boat, and brought fre&s;h Provi&s;ions for the
Sloop, which the Men had need enough of; he
brought in particularly &s;eventeen large Casks of
Arrack, as big as Buts, be&s;ides &s;maller Quantities,
a Quantity of Rice, and Abundance of Fruits,
Mangoes, Pompions, and &s;uch Things, with
Fowls and Fi&s;h. He never came on board but
he was deep laden; for, in &s;hort, he bought for
the Ship, as well as for them&s;elves; and particu|ly,
they half loaded the Ship with Rice and Ar|rack,
with &s;ome Hogs, and &s;ix or &s;even Cows, a|live;
and thus being well victualled, and having
Directions for coming again, they returned
to us.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> was always the lucky welcome Me&s;&s;en|ger
to us, but never more welcome to us than
now; for where we had thru&s;t in the Ship we could
get nothing, except a few Mangoes and Roots,
<PB N="312" REF="330">
being not willing to make any Steps into the
Country, or make our &s;elves known, till we had
News of our Sloop; and indeed our Mens Pa|tience
was almo&s;t tired, for it was &s;eventeen
Days that <HI>William</HI> &s;pent upon this Enterprize,
and well be&s;tow'd too.</P>
<P>When he came back, we had another Confe|rence
upon the Subject of Trade, namely, whe|ther
we &s;hould &s;end the re&s;t of our Spices, and
other Goods we had in the Ship, to <HI>Surat;</HI> or,
whether we &s;hould go up to the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>
our &s;elves, where it was probable we might &s;ell
them as well as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants of <HI>Surat.
William</HI> was for going our &s;elves, which, by the
Way, was from the good frugal Merchant-like
Temper of the Man, who was for the be&s;t of
every Thing: But here I over-ruled <HI>William,</HI>
which I very &s;eldom took upon me to do; but I
told him, that, con&s;idering our Circum&s;tances, it
was much better for us to &s;ell all our Cargoe
here, though we made but half Price of them,
than to go with them to the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
where we &s;hould run a greater Ri&s;que, and where
People would be much more curious and inqui&s;i|tive
into Things than they were here, and where
it would not be &s;o ea&s;y to manage them, &s;eeing
they traded freely and openly there, not by
Stealth, as tho&s;e Men &s;eemed to do; and be&s;ides,
if they &s;u&s;pected any Thing, it would be much
more difficult for us to retreat, except by meer
Force, than here, where we were upon the
high Sea, as it were, and could be gone when|ever
we plea&s;ed, without any Di&s;gui&s;e, or indeed
without the lea&s;t Appearance of being pur&s;ued,
none knowing where to look for us.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="331">
My Apprehen&s;ions prevailed with <HI>William,</HI>
whether my Rea&s;ons did or no, and he &s;ubmit|ted;
and we re&s;olved to try another Ship's Load|ing
to the &s;ame Merchants; the main Bu&s;ine&s;s
was to con&s;ider how to get off of that Circum|&s;tance
had expo&s;ed them with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants;
namely, that it was our other Sloop;
but this the old Quaker Pilot undertook; for
being, as I &s;aid, and excellent Mimick him&s;elf, it
was the ea&s;ier for him to dre&s;s up the Sloop in
new Clothes; and fir&s;t he put on all the carved
Work he had taken off before; her Stern, which
was painted of a dumb white, or dun Colour, be|fore
all flat, was now all lacquer'd, and blue,
and I know not how many gay Figures in it; as
to her Quarter, the Carpenters made her a neat
little Gallery on either Side; &s;he had 12 Guns
put into her, and &s;ome Patereroes upon her Gun|nel,
none of which were there before; and to
fini&s;h her new Habit or Appearance, and make
her Change compleat, he ordered her Sails to be
alter'd; and as &s;he &s;ailed before with a Half-Sprit,
like a Yacht, &s;he &s;ailed now with &s;quare
Sail and Mizen Ma&s;t, like a Ketch; &s;o that, in a
Word, &s;he was a perfect Cheat, di&s;gui&s;ed in e|very
Thing that a Stranger could be &s;uppo&s;ed to
take any Notice of, that had never had but one
View; for they had been but once on board.</P>
<P>In this mean Figure the Sloop returned; &s;he
had a new Man put into her for Captain, one we
knew how to tru&s;t; and the old Pilot appearing
only as a Pa&s;&s;enger, the Doctor and <HI>William</HI>
acting as the Super-Cargoes, by a formal Procu|ration
from one Captain <HI>Singleton,</HI> and all Things
ordered in Form,</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="332">
We had a compleat Loading for the Sloop;
for be&s;ides a very great Quantity of Nutmegs
and Cloves, Mace, and &s;ome Cinnamon, &s;he had
on board &s;ome Goods, which we took in as we
lay about the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands, while we waited
as looking for Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> made no Difficulty of &s;elling this Car|goe
al&s;o, and in about twenty Days returned
again, freighted with all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions for
our Voyage, and for a long Time; and, as I &s;ay,
we had a great deal of other Goods, he brought
us back about three and thirty thou&s;and Pieces
of Eight, and &s;ome Diamonds; which, tho' <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
did not pretend to much Skill in, yet he
made &s;hift to act, &s;o as not to be impo&s;ed upon,
the Merchants he had to deal with too being
very fair Men.</P>
<P>They had no Difficulty at all with the&s;e Mer|chants;
for the Pro&s;pect they had of Gain made
them not at all inqui&s;itive; nor did they make
the lea&s;t Di&s;covery of the Sloop; and as to the
Selling them Spices which were fetch'd &s;o far
from thence, it &s;eems it was not &s;o much a No|velty
there as we believed; for the <HI>Portugueze</HI>
had frequently Ve&s;&s;els which came from <HI>Macao</HI>
in <HI>China,</HI> who brought Spices, which they bought
of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Traders, who again frequently
dealt among the <HI>Dutch</HI> Spice I&s;lands, and re|ceived
Spices in Exchange for &s;uch Goods as they
carried from <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>This might be called indeed the only trading
Voyage we had made; and now we were really
very rich; and it came now naturally before us
to con&s;ider whither we &s;hould go next; our pro|per
Delivery Port, as we ought to have called it,
was at <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Mangahelly:</HI> But
<PB N="315" REF="333">
<HI>William</HI> took me by my &s;elf into the Cabbin of
the Sloop one Day, and told me, he wanted to
talk &s;eriou&s;ly with me a little; &s;o we &s;hut our
&s;elves in, and <HI>William</HI> began with me.</P>
<P>Wilt thou give me Leave, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> to talk
plainly with thee upon thy pre&s;ent Circum&s;tan|ces,
and the future Pro&s;pect of living, and wilt
thou promi&s;e on thy Word to take nothing
ill of me.</P>
<P>With all my Heart, <HI>&s;aid I, William,</HI> I have al|ways
found your Advice good, and your De&s;igns
have not only been well laid, but your Coun&s;el
has been very lucky to us; and therefore &s;ay
what you will, I promi&s;e you I will not take
it ill.</P>
<P>But that is not all my Demand, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> if
thou do&s;t not like what I am going to propo&s;e to
thee, thou &s;halt promi&s;e me not to make it pub|lick
among the Men.</P>
<P>I will not, <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> upon my Word, and
&s;wore to him too very heartily.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> I have but one Thing
more to article with thee about, and that is,
that thou wilt con&s;ent, that if thou do&s;t not ap|prove
of it for thy &s;elf, thou wilt yet con&s;ent
that I &s;hall put &s;o much of it in Practice as re|lates
to my &s;elf, and my new Comrade <HI>Doctor,</HI>
&s;o that it be in nothing to thy Detriment and
Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>In any Thing, <HI>&s;ays I, William,</HI> but leaving
me, I will; but I cannot part with you upon any
Terms whatever.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> I am not de&s;igning to part
from thee, unle&s;s it is thy own Doing; but a&s;&s;ure
me in all the&s;e Points; and I will tell my Mind
freely.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="334">
So I promi&s;ed him every Thing he de&s;ired of
me in the &s;olemne&s;t Manner po&s;&s;ible, and &s;o &s;eri|ou&s;ly
and frankly withal, that <HI>William</HI> made no
Scruple to open his Mind to me.</P>
<P>Why then, in the fir&s;t Place, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> &s;hall
I ask thee if thou do&s;t not think thou and all thy
Men are rich enough, and have really gotten as
much Wealth together (by what&s;over Way it
has been gotten, that is not the Que&s;tion) as ye
all know what to do with?</P>
<P>Why truly <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> thou art pretty
right, I think we have had pretty good
Luck.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> I would ask, whether,
if thou ha&s;t gotten enough, thou ha&s;t any
Thought of leaving off this Trade; for mo&s;t Peo|ple
leave off Trading when they are &s;atisfied
with getting, and are rich enough; for no body
trades for the &s;ake of Trading, much le&s;s do any
Men rob for the &s;ake of Thieving.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> now I perceive what it is
thou art driving at; I warrant you, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you
begin to hanker after Home.</P>
<P>Why truly, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> thou ha&s;t &s;aid it,
and &s;o I hope thou do&s;t too; it is natural for mo&s;t
Men that are abroad to de&s;ire to come Home
again at la&s;t, e&s;pecially when they are grown rich,
and when they are (as thou owne&s;t thy &s;elf to be)
rich enough, and &s;o rich, as they know not what
to do with more if they had it.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> but now you think
you have laid your Preliminary at fir&s;t &s;o
home, that I &s;hould have nothing to &s;ay; that
is, that when I had got Money enough, it would
be natural to think of going Home; but you
have not explained what you mean by Home,
<PB N="317" REF="335">
and there you and I &s;hall differ. Why, Man, I
am at Home, here is my Habitation, I never had
any other in my Life time; I was a kind of Cha|rity
School-Boy, &s;o that I can have no De&s;ire of
going any where for being rich or poor, for I
have no where to go.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> looking a little confu&s;ed, art
not thou an <HI>Engli&s;hman?</HI> Yes, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I think &s;o, you
&s;ee I &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but I came out of <HI>England</HI> a
Child, and never was in it but once &s;ince I was a
Man, and then I was cheated and impo&s;ed upon,
and u&s;ed &s;o ill, that I care not if I never &s;ee it
more.</P>
<P>Why ha&s;t thou no Relations or Friends there,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> no Acquaintance, none that thou ha&s;t
any Kindne&s;s for, or any remains of Re&s;pect
for?</P>
<P>Not I, <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> not one, no more than
I have in the Court of the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI></P>
<P>Nor any Kindne&s;s for the Country, where
thou wa&s;t born, <HI>&s;ays William.</HI></P>
<P>Not I, any more than for the I&s;land of <HI>Mada|ga&s;car,</HI>
nor &s;o much neither, for that has been a
fortunate I&s;land to me more than once, as thou
knowe&s;t, <HI>William, &s;aid I.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William</HI> was quite &s;tunn'd at my Di&s;cour&s;e, and
held his Peace; and <HI>I &s;aid to him,</HI> go on, <HI>William,</HI>
what ha&s;t thou to &s;ay farther? For I hear you
have &s;ome Project in your Head, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> come,
let's have it out.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> thou ha&s;t put me to Silence,
and all I had to &s;ay is over-thrown; all my Pro|jects
are come to nothing, and gone.</P>
<P>Well, but <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> let me hear what
they were, for tho' it is &s;o that what I have to
aim at does not look your Way; and tho' I have
<PB N="318" REF="336">
no Relation, no Friend, no Acquaintance in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
yet I do not &s;ay I like this roving, crui&s;ing
Life, &s;o well as never to give it over: Let me
hear if thou can&s;t propo&s;e to me any thing be|yond
it.</P>
<P>Certainly Friend, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> very gravely,
there is &s;omething beyond it, and lifting up his
Hands, he &s;eemed very much affected, and I
thought I &s;ee Tears &s;tand in his Eyes, but I, that
was too hardned a Wretch to be moved with the&s;e
Things, laughed at him; what, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you
mean <HI>Death,</HI> I warrant you, don't you, that is
beyond this Trade; why, when it comes, it
comes, then we are all provided for.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> that is true; but it wou'd be
better that &s;ome Things were thought on before
that came.</P>
<P>Thought on, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what &s;ignifies thinking of
it; to think of Death, is to dye; and to be al|ways
thinking of it, is to be all one's Life-long a
dying; 'tis Time enough to think of it when it
comes.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily believe I was well qualified for
a Pirate that could talk thus; but let me leave it
upon Record for the Remark of other hardned
Rogues like my &s;elf. My Con&s;cience gave me a
Pang that I had never felt before, when I &s;aid,
<HI>What &s;ignifies thinking of it,</HI> and told me, I &s;hou'd
one Day think of the&s;e Words with a &s;ad Heart,
but the Time of my Reflection was not yet
come; &s;o I went on.</P>
<P><HI>Says William,</HI> very &s;eriou&s;ly, I mu&s;t tell thee,
Friend, I am &s;orry to hear thee talk &s;o; they that
never think of dying, often dye without think|ing
of it.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="337">
I carried on the je&s;ting Way a while farther,
<HI>and &s;aid,</HI> prithee do not talk of dying; how do
we know we &s;hall ever dye, and began to laugh?</P>
<P>I need not an&s;wer thee to that, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> it
is not my Place to reprove thee who art Comman|der
over me here, but I had rather thou would&s;t
talk otherwi&s;e of Death; 'tis a coar&s;e Thing.</P>
<P>Say any Thing to me, <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> I will take
it kindly: <HI>I began now to be very much moved at his
Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Says William,</HI> Tears running down his Face, it
is becau&s;e Men live as if they were never to dye,
that &s;o many dye before they know how to live;
but it was not Death that I meant, when I &s;aid,
<HI>That there was &s;omething to be thought of beyond this
Way of Living.</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> what was that?</P>
<P>It was <HI>Repentance, &s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> did you ever know a Pirate re|pent?</P>
<P>At this he &s;tarted a little, and return'd, at the
Gallows, I have one before, and I hope thou wilt
be the &s;econd.</P>
<P>He &s;poke this very affectionately, and with an
Appearance of Concern for me.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> I thank you, and I am
not &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s of the&s;e Things, perhaps, as I
make my &s;elf &s;eem to be; but come, let me hear
your Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>My Propo&s;al, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> is for thy Good, as
well as my own; we may put an End to this kind
of Life, and repent; and I think the faire&s;t Oc|ca&s;ion
offers for both at this very Time that
ever did, or ever will, or indeed, can happen
again.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="338">
Look you, <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> let me have your
Propo&s;al for putting an End to our pre&s;ent Way
of Living fir&s;t, for that is the Ca&s;e before us,
and you and I will talk of the other afterward.
I am not &s;o in&s;en&s;ible, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> as you may think
me to be; but let us get out of this helli&s;h Con|dition
we are in fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> thou art in the right there;
we mu&s;t never talk of repenting while we con|tinue
Pirates.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays I, William,</HI> that's what I meant, for
if we mu&s;t not reform, as well as be &s;orry for
what's done, I have no Notion what Repentance
means; indeed, at be&s;t I know little of the Mat|ter;
but the Nature of the thing &s;eems to tell
me, that the fir&s;t Step we have to take, is to
break off this wretched Cour&s;e, and I'll begin
there with you with all my Heart.</P>
<P>I could &s;ee by his Countenance, that <HI>William</HI>
was throughly plea&s;ed with the Offer; and if he
had Tears in his Eyes before, he had more now,
but it was from a quite differing Pa&s;&s;ion, for he
was &s;o &s;wallow'd up with Joy, he could not
&s;peak.</P>
<P>Come, <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> thou &s;hewe&s;t me plain
enough thou ha&s;t an hone&s;t Meaning. Do&s;t thou
think 'tis practicable for us to put an End to our
unhappy Way of Living here, and get off?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I think 'tis very practicable for
me, whether 'tis for thee or no, that will depend
upon thy &s;elf.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I give you my Word, that as I
have commanded you all along, from the Time I
fir&s;t took you on Board, &s;o you &s;hall command me
from this Hour; and every thing you direct me,
I'll do.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="339">
Wilt thou leave it all to me? Do&s;t thou &s;ay
this freely?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> freely, and I'll perform it
faithfully.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> my Scheme is this,
we are now at the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
we have &s;old &s;o much of our Cargo here at <HI>Surat,</HI>
that we have Money enough; &s;end me away for
<HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> with the Sloop, loaden with the <HI>China</HI>
Goods we have on Board, which will make ano|ther
good Cargo; and I'll warrant thee I'll find
Means among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants
there, to lodge a Quantity of Goods and Money
al&s;o <HI>as a Merchant,</HI> &s;o as we will be able to have
Recour&s;e to it again upon any Occa&s;ion, and
when I come Home we will contrive the re&s;t;
and in the mean Time do you bring the Ship's
Crew to take a Re&s;olution to go to <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI>
as &s;oon as I return.</P>
<P>I told him, I thought he need not go &s;o far as
<HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> but might run into <HI>Gombaroon,</HI> or to <HI>Or|mus,</HI>
and pretend the &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>No, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I cannot act with the &s;ame Free|dom
there, becau&s;e the Company's Factory are
there, and I may be laid hold of there on Pre|tence
of Interloping.</P>
<P>Well, but, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you may go to <HI>Ormus</HI> then,
for I am loath to part with you &s;o long as to go to
the Bottom of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph. He return'd
that I &s;hould leave it to him to do as he &s;hould
&s;ee Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We had taken a large Sum of Money at <HI>Surat;</HI>
&s;o that we had near a hundred thou&s;and Pounds
in Money at our Command; but on board the
great Ship we had &s;till a great deal more.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="340">
I ordered him publickly to keep the Money on
board which he had, and to buy up with it a
Quantity of Ammunition if he could get it, and
&s;o to furni&s;h us for new Exploits; and in the
mean Time I re&s;olved to get a Quantity of Gold
and &s;ome Jewels, which I had on board the
great Ship, and place them &s;o, that I might car|ry
them off without Notice, as &s;oon as he came
back; and &s;o according to <HI>William</HI>'s Directions, I
left him to go the Voyage, and I went on board
the great Ship, in which we had indeed an im|men&s;e
Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We waited no le&s;s than two Months, for <HI>Willi|am</HI>'s
Return; and indeed I began to be very
unea&s;y about <HI>William,</HI> &s;ometimes thinking he had
abandoned me, and that he might have u&s;ed the
&s;ame Artifice to have engaged the other Men to
comply with him, and &s;o they were gone away
together; and it was but three Days before his
Return, that I was ju&s;t upon the Point of re&s;ol|ving
to go away to <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> and give him
over; but the old Surgeon, who mimicked the
Quaker, and pa&s;&s;ed for the Ma&s;ter of the Sloop
at <HI>Surat,</HI> per&s;waded me again&s;t that; for which
good Advice, and his apparent Faithfulne&s;s in
what he had been tru&s;ted with, I made him a
Party to my De&s;ign, and he proved very
hone&s;t.</P>
<P>At length <HI>William</HI> came back, to our inexpre&s;|&s;ible
Joy, and brought a great many nece&s;&s;ary
Things with him; as particularly, he brought
&s;ixty Barrels of Powder, &s;ome Iron Shot, and a|bout
thirty Ton of Lead; al&s;o he brought a
great deal of Provi&s;ions; and in a Word, <HI>William</HI>
gave me a publick Account of his Voyage, in the
Hearing of whoever happened to be upon the
<PB N="323" REF="341">
Quarter-Deck, that no Su&s;picions might be
found about us.</P>
<P>After all was done, <HI>William</HI> moved, that he
might go up again, and that I would go with
him; named &s;everal Things which we had on
board that he could not &s;ell there, and particu|larly
told us, he had been obliged to leave &s;eve|ral
Things there, the Caravans being not come
in; and that he had ingaged to come back again
with Goods.</P>
<P>This was what I wanted; the Men were eager
for his Going, and particularly becau&s;e he told
them they might load the Sloop back with
Rice and Provi&s;ions: But I &s;eemed backward to
going; when the old Surgeon &s;tood up, and per|&s;waded
me to go, and with many Arguments
pre&s;&s;ed me to it; as particularly, if I did not go,
there would be no Order, and &s;everal of the
Men might drop away, and perhaps betray all
the re&s;t; and that they &s;hould not think it &s;afe
for the Sloop to go again, if I did not go; and
to urge me to it, he offered him&s;elf to go
with me.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations I &s;eemed to be over|per&s;waded
to go; and all the Company &s;eemed
the better &s;atisfied when I had con&s;ented: And
accordingly we took all the Powder, Lead, and
Iron out of the Sloop into the great Ship, and
all the other Things that were for the Ship's
U&s;e, and put in &s;ome Bales of Spices, and Casks
or Frailes of Cloves, in all about &s;even Ton, and
&s;ome other Goods, among the Bales of which I
had convey'd all my private Trea&s;ure, which, I
a&s;&s;ure you, was of no &s;mall Value; and away
I went.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="342">
At going off, I called a Council of all the Offi|cers
in the Ship, to con&s;ider in what Place they
&s;hould wait for me, and how long, where we ap|pointed
the Ship to &s;tay eight and twenty Days,
at a little I&s;land on the <HI>Arabian</HI> Side of the Gulph;
and that if the Sloop did not come in that Time,
they &s;hould &s;ail to another I&s;land to the We&s;t of
that Place, and wait there fifteen Days more;
and that then if the Sloop did not come, they
&s;hould conclude &s;ome Accident mu&s;t have hap|pened,
and the Rendezvous &s;hould be at <HI>Ma|daga&s;car.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus re&s;olved, we left the Ship, which
both <HI>William,</HI> and I, and the Surgeon never in|rended
to &s;ee any more: We &s;teered directly
for the Gulph, and through to <HI>Ba&s;&s;aro,</HI> or <HI>Bal&s;ara.</HI>
This City of <HI>Bal&s;ara</HI> lies at &s;ome Di&s;tance from
the Place where our Sloop lay, and the River
not being very &s;afe, and we but ill acquainted
with it, having but an ordinary Pilot, we went
on Shore at a Village where &s;ome Merchants live,
and which is very populous, for the &s;ake of &s;mall
Ve&s;&s;els riding there.</P>
<P>Here we &s;tay'd, and traded three or four
Days, landing all our Bales and Spices, and in|deed
the whole Cargoe, that was of any con&s;ide|rable
Value; which we cho&s;e to do rather than
go up immediately to <HI>Bal&s;ara,</HI> till the Project
we had laid was put in Execution.</P>
<P>After we had bought &s;everal Goods, and were
preparing to buy &s;everal others, the Boat being
on Shore with twelve Men, my &s;elf, <HI>William,</HI> the
Surgeon, and one Fourth Man, whom we had
&s;ingled out, we contrived to &s;end a <HI>Turk,</HI> ju&s;t at
the Dusk of the Evening, with a Letter to the
Boat&s;wain; and giving the Fellow a Charge to
<PB N="325" REF="343">
run with all po&s;&s;ible Speed, we &s;tood at a &s;mall

and no &s;ooner were they on board, but they
took the Hint, as we &s;uppo&s;ed; for the next
Morning they were out of Sight; and we
never heard Tale or Tidings of them &s;ince.</P>
<P>We were now in a good Place, and in very
good Circum&s;tances, for we pa&s;t for Mer|chants
of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>It is not material to record here what a
Ma&s;s of ill-gotten Wealth we had got together:
It will be more to the Purpo&s;e to tell you, that I
began to be &s;en&s;ible of the Crime of getting of it
in &s;uch a Manner as I had done, that I had very
little Satisfaction in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and, as
I told <HI>William,</HI> I had no Expectation of keeping it,
<PB N="326" REF="344">
nor much De&s;ire; but as I &s;aid to him one Day
walking out into the Fields near the Town at
<HI>Ba&s;&s;aro,</HI> &s;o I depended upon it, that it would be
the Ca&s;e, which you will hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>We were perfectly &s;ecured at <HI>Ba&s;&s;aro,</HI> by ha|ving
frighted away the Rogues, our Comrades;
and we had nothing to do but to con&s;ider how to
vert our Trea&s;ure in Things proper to make us
look like Merchants, as we were now to be,
and not like Free-booters, as we really had
been.</P>
<P>We happened very opportunely here upon
a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> who had travelled from <HI>Bengal</HI> to
<HI>Agra,</HI> the Capital City of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and
from thence was come to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> by
Land, and got Shipping &s;ome how or other up
the Gulph; and we found his De&s;ign was to go
up the great River to <HI>Bagdat</HI> or <HI>Babylon;</HI> and &s;o
by the Caravan to <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Scanderoon.</HI> As <HI>Willi|am</HI>
&s;poke <HI>Dutch,</HI> and was of an agreeable in&s;inua|ting
Behaviour, he &s;oon got acquainted with this
<HI>Dutchman,</HI> and di&s;covering our Circum&s;tances to
one another, we found he had con&s;iderable Effects
with him; and that he had traded long in that
Country, and was making homeward to his own
Country; and that he had Servants with him,
one an <HI>Armenian,</HI> whom he had taught to &s;peak
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and who had &s;omething of his own, but
had a Mind to travel into <HI>Europe;</HI> and the other
a <HI>Dutch</HI> Sailor, whom he had picked up by his Fan|cy,
and repo&s;ed a great Tru&s;t in him, and a very
hone&s;t Fellow he was.</P>
<P>This <HI>Dutchman</HI> was very glad of an Acquain|tance,
becau&s;e he &s;oon found that we direct|ed
our Thoughts to <HI>Europe</HI> al&s;o, and as he
found we were encumber'd with Goods only,
<PB N="327" REF="345">
for we let him know nothing of our Money, he
readily offer'd us his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to di&s;po&s;e of as
many of them as the Place we were in would put
off, and his Advice what to do with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>While this was doing, <HI>William</HI> and I con&s;ulted
what to do with our &s;elves, and what we had;
and fir&s;t we re&s;olved we would never talk &s;eriou&s;ly
of any of our Mea&s;ures, but in the open Fields,
where we were &s;ure no Body could hear; &s;o every
Evening, when the Sun began to decline, and the
Air to be moderate, we walk'd out &s;ometimes
this Way, &s;ometimes that, to con&s;ult of our Af|fairs.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that we had new
cloathed our &s;elves here after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Manner,
in long Ve&s;ts of Silk, a Gown or Robe of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Crim&s;on Cloth, very fine and hand&s;ome, and had
let our Beards grow &s;o after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Manner,
that we pa&s;t for <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchants, in View only,
tho', <HI>by the Way,</HI> we could not under&s;tand or &s;peak
one Word of the Language of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or indeed
of any other but <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and of the
latter I under&s;tood very little.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Dutchman</HI> &s;upply'd all this for
us, and as we had re&s;olved to keep our &s;elves as
retired as we could, though there were &s;everal
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants upon the Place, yet we never
acquainted our &s;elves with one of them, or ex|changed
a Word with them, by which Means we
prevented their Enquiry of us now, or their
giving any Intelligence of us, if any News of
our Landing here &s;hould happen to come, which it
was ea&s;y for us to know, was po&s;&s;ible enough, if
any of our Comrades fell into bad Hands, or by
many Accidents which we could not fore&s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="346">
It was during my being here, for here we
&s;tay'd near two Months, that I grew very thought|ful
about my Circum&s;tances, not as to the Dan|ger,
neither indeed were we in any, but were
entirely conceal'd and un&s;u&s;pected; but I really
began to have other Thoughts of my &s;elf, and of
the World, than ever I had before.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> had &s;truck &s;o deep into my unthinking
Temper, with hinting to me, that there was
&s;omething beyond all this, that the pre&s;ent Time
was the Time of Enjoyment, but that the Time
of Account approached; that the Work that re|main'd
was gentler than the Labour pa&s;t, <HI>viz.
Repentance,</HI> and that it was high Time to think of
it; I &s;ay the&s;e, and &s;uch Thoughts as the&s;e, en|gro&s;s'd
my Hours, and in a Word, I grew very
&s;ad.</P>
<P>As to the Wealth I had, which was immen&s;ely
great, it was all like Dirt under my Feet; I had
no Value for it, no Peace in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it,
no great Concern about me for the leaving of it.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> had perceiv'd my Thoughts to be
troubled, and my Mind heavy and oppre&s;t for
&s;ome Time; and one Evening, in one of our cool
Walks, I began with him about the leaving our
Effects. <HI>William</HI> was a wi&s;e and wary Man, and
indeed all the Prudentials of my Conduct, had
for a long Time been owing to his Advice, and &s;o
now all the Methods for pre&s;erving our Effects,
and even our &s;elves lay upon him; and he had
been telling me of &s;ome of the Mea&s;ures he had
been taking for our making homeward, and for
the Security of our Wealth, when I took him
very &s;hort. <HI>Why, William,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>do&s;t thou think
we &s;hall ever be able to reach</HI> Europe <HI>with all this Cargo
that we have about us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="347">
Ay, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> without doubt, as well as other
Merchants with theirs, as long as it is not pub|lickly
known what Quantity, or of what Value
our Cargo con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> &s;miling, do you think
that if there is a <HI>God above,</HI> as you have &s;o long
been telling me there is, and that we mu&s;t give an
Account to him? I &s;ay, Do you think if he be
a righteous Judge, he will let us e&s;cape thus with
the Plunder, as we may call it, of &s;o many inno|cent
People, nay, I might &s;ay Nations, and not
call us to an Account for it before we can get to
<HI>Europe,</HI> where we pretend to enjoy it?</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> appeared &s;truck and &s;urprized at the
Que&s;tion, and made no An&s;wer for a great while,
and I repeated the Que&s;tion, adding, that it was
not to be expected.</P>
<P>After a little Pau&s;e, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> Thou ha&s;t
&s;tarted a very weighty Que&s;tion, and I can make
no po&s;itive An&s;wer to it, but I will &s;tate it thus;
fir&s;t, it is Time, that if we con&s;ider the Ju&s;tice of
God, we have no Rea&s;on to expect any Protection,
but as the ordinary Ways of Providence are out
of the common Road of human Affairs, &s;o we may
hope for Mercy &s;till upon our Repentance, and
we know not how good he may be to us; &s;o we
are to act as if we rather depended upon the la&s;t,
I mean the merciful Part, than claimed the
fir&s;t, which mu&s;t produce nothing but Judgment
and Vengeance.</P>
<P>But hark ye, <HI>William, &s;ays I,</HI> the Nature of Re|pentance,
as you hinted once to me, included
Reformation, and we can never reform; how
then can we repent?</P>
<P>Why, can we never reform, <HI>&s;ays William?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="348">
Becau&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> we cannot re&s;tore what we
have taken away by Rapine and Spoil.</P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> we can never do that,
for we can never come to the Knowledge of the
Owners$</P>
<P>But what then mu&s;t be done with our Wealth,
<HI>&s;aid I,</HI> The Effects of Plunder and Rapine? If we
keep it, we continue to be Robbers and Thieves,
and if we quit it, we cannot do Ju&s;tice with it,
for we cannot re&s;tore it to the right Owners?</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> the An&s;wer to it is &s;hort;
to quit what we have, and do it here, is to throw
it away to tho&s;e who have no Claim to it, and to
dive&s;t our &s;elves of it, but to do no Right with
it; whereas we ought to keep it carefully toge|ther,
with a Re&s;olution to do what Right with it
we are able; and who knows what Opportunity
Providence may put into our Hands, to do Ju&s;tice
at lea&s;t to &s;ome of tho&s;e we have injured, &s;o we
ought at lea&s;t to leave it to him, and go on, as it
is, without doubt, our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s to do, to
&s;ome Place of Safety, where we may wait his
Will.</P>
<P>This Refolution of <HI>William</HI> was very &s;atisfying
to me indeed, as, the Truth is, all he &s;aid, and at
all Times, was &s;olid and good; and had not <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
thus, as it were, quieted my Mind, I think
verily I was &s;o alarmed at the ju&s;t Rea&s;on I had to
expect Vengeance from Heaven upon me for my
ill-gotten Wealth, that I &s;hould have run away
from it as the Devil's Goods; that I had nothing
to do with that did not belong to me, and that I
had no Right to keep, and was in certain Danger
of being de&s;troy'd for.</P>
<P>However, <HI>William</HI> &s;ettled my Mind to more
prudent Steps than the&s;e, and I concluded that I
<PB N="331" REF="349">
ought, however, to proceed to a Place of Safety,
and leave the Event to God Almighty's Mercy;
but this I mu&s;t leave upon Record, that I had
from this Time no Joy of the Wealth I had got;
I look'd upon it all as a &s;tolen, and &s;o indeed the
greate&s;t Part of it was; I look'd upon it as a
Hoard of other Mens Goods, which I had robbed
the innocent Owners of, and which I ought, in a
Word, to be hanged for here, and damned for
hereafter; and now indeed I began &s;incerely to
hate my &s;elf for a Dog, a Wretch that had been
a Thief, and a Murtherer; a Wretch, that was
in a Condition which no Body was ever in; for I
had robb'd, and tho' I had the Wealth by me,
yet it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever make any
Re&s;titution; and upon this Account it run in my
Head, that I could never repent, for that Re|pentance
could not be &s;incere without Re&s;tituti|on,
and therefore I mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be damned,
there was no room for me to e&s;cape: I went about
with my Heart full of the&s;e Thoughts, little bet|ter
than a di&s;tracted Fellow; in &s;hort, running
headlong into the dreadfulle&s;t De&s;pair, and pre|meditated
nothing but how to rid my &s;elf out of
the World; and indeed the Devil, if &s;uch Things
are of the Devil's immediate doing, followed his
Work very clo&s;e with me, and nothing lay upon
my Mind for &s;everal Days, but to &s;hoot my &s;elf
into the Head with my Pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>I was all this while in a vagrant Life, among
Infidels, Turks, Pagans, and &s;uch Sort of People;
I had no Mini&s;ter, no Chri&s;tian, to conver&s;e with,
but poor <HI>William,</HI> he was my Gho&s;tly Father, or
Confe&s;&s;or, and he was all the Comfort I had. As
for my Knowledge of Religion, you have heard
my Hi&s;tory; you may &s;uppo&s;e I had not much,
<PB N="332" REF="350">
and as for the Word of God, I don't remember
that I ever read a Chapter in the <HI>Bible</HI> in my Life|time;
I was <HI>little Bob</HI> at <HI>Bu&s;&s;elton,</HI> and went to
School to learn my <HI>Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P>However, it plea&s;ed God to make <HI>William</HI> the
Quaker every thing to me; upon this Occa&s;ion I
took him out one Evening as u&s;ual, and hurried
him away into the Fields with me, in more Ha&s;te
than ordinary, and there, in &s;hort, I told him
the Perplexity of my Mind, and under what ter|rible
Temptations of the Devil I had been, that
I mu&s;t &s;hoot my &s;elf, for I could not &s;upport the
Weight and Terror that was upon me.</P>
<P>Shoot your &s;elf, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> why, what will
that do for you?</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> 'twill put an End to a mi&s;erable
Life.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> are you &s;atisfied the next
will be better?</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> much wor&s;e to be &s;ure.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;hoot your &s;elf is the De|vil's
Notion, no doubt, for 'tis the Devil of a
Rea&s;on, that becau&s;e thou art in an ill Ca&s;e, that
therefore thou mu&s;t put thy &s;elf into a wor&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;hock'd my Rea&s;on indeed: Well, but
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> there is no bearing the mi&s;erable Condition
I am in.</P>
<P>Very well, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> but it &s;eems there is
&s;ome bearing a wor&s;e Condition, and &s;o you will
&s;hoot your &s;elf, that you may be pa&s;t Remedy.</P>
<P>I am pa&s;t Remedy already, <HI>&s;ays I.</HI></P>
<P>How do you know that, <HI>&s;ayshe?</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;atisfied of it, <HI>&s;aid I.</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but you are not &s;ure, &s;o you will
&s;hoot your &s;elf to make it certain; for tho' on this
&s;ide Death you can't be &s;ure you will be damned
<PB N="333" REF="351">
at all, yet the Moment you &s;tep on the other &s;ide
of Time, you are &s;ure of it; for when 'tis done,
'tis not to be &s;aid then that you will, but that you
are damned.</P>
<P><HI>Well, but, &s;ays</HI> William, <HI>as if he had been between
Je&s;t and Earne&s;t,</HI> pray, what did&s;t thou dream of
la&s;t Night?</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I had frightful Dreams all Night,
and particularly I dreamt that the Devil came for
me, and asked me what my Name was? and I
told him, then he askt me what Trade I was?
Trade, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I am a Thief, a Rogue, by my Cal|ling;
I am a Pirate, and a Murtherer, and ought
to be hanged; ay, ay, &s;ays the Devil, &s;o you do,
and you are the Man I look'd for, and therefore
come along with me, at which I was mo&s;t horri|bly
frighted, and cried out, &s;o that it waked me,
and I have been in a horrible Agony ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Very well, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> come, give me the
Pi&s;tol thou talk'&s;t of ju&s;t now.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what will you do with it?</P>
<P>Do with it, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> why, thou need&s;t not
&s;hoot thy &s;elf, I &s;hall be obliged to do it for thee,
why, thou wilt de&s;troy us all.</P>
<P>What do you mean, <HI>William, &s;aid I?</HI></P>
<P>Mean, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> nay, what di&s;t thou mean? to
cry out aloud in thy Sleep, <HI>I am a Thief, a Pirate,
u Murtherer, and ought to be hanged;</HI> why, thou
wilt ruine us all, 'twas well the <HI>Dutchman</HI> did not
under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> In &s;hort, I mu&s;t &s;hoot thee to
&s;ave my own Life; come, come, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> give me
thy Pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, this terrified me again another Way,
and I began to be &s;en&s;ible, that if any Body had
been near me to under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I had been
undone, and the Thought of &s;hooting my &s;elf
<PB N="334" REF="352">
for&s;ook me from that Time, and I turned to <HI>Wil|liam;</HI>
you di&s;order me extremely, <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI>
why, I am never &s;afe, nor is it &s;afe to keep me
Company, what &s;hall I do? I &s;hall betray you all.</P>
<P>Come, come, Friend <HI>Bob, &s;ays he,</HI> I'll put an
End to it all, if you will take my Advice.</P>
<P>How's that, <HI>&s;aid I?</HI></P>
<P>Why only, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that <HI>the next Time thou
talke&s;t with the Devil, thou wilt talk a little &s;oftlier,</HI>
or we &s;hall be all undone, and you too.</P>
<P>This frighted me, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, and allay'd a
great deal of the Trouble of Mind I was in; but
<HI>William,</HI> after he had done je&s;ting with me, enter|ed
upon a very long and &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e with me
about the Nature of my Circum&s;tances, and about
Repentance, that it ought to be attended indeed
with a deep Abhorrence of the Crime that I had
to charge my &s;elf with, but that to de&s;pair of
God's Mercy was no Part of Repentance, but put|ting
my &s;elf into the Condition of the Devil; in|deed,
that I mu&s;t apply my &s;elf with a &s;incere
humble Confe&s;&s;ion of my Crime, to ask Pardon of
God whom I had offended, and ca&s;t my &s;elf upon
his Mercy, re&s;olving to be willing to make Re|&s;titution,
if ever it &s;hould plea&s;e God to put it in|to
my Power, even to the utmo&s;t of what I had in
the World; and this he told me was the Method
which he had re&s;olved upon him&s;elf, and in this
he told me he had found Comfort.</P>
<P>I had a great deal of Satisfaction in <HI>William's</HI>
Di&s;cour&s;e, and it quieted me very much; but
<HI>William</HI> was very anxious ever after about my
talking in my Sleep, and took care to lye with me
always him&s;elf, and to keep me from Lodging in
any Hou&s;e, where &s;o much as a Word of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
was under&s;tood.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="353">
However, there was not the like Occa&s;ion af|terward,
for I was much more compo&s;ed in my
Mind, and re&s;olved for the future to live a quite
differing Life from what I had done: As to the
Wealth I had, I look'd upon it as nothing; I re|&s;olved
to &s;et it apart to any &s;uch Opportunity of
doing Ju&s;tice, that God &s;hould put into my
Hand, and the miraculous Opportunity I had af|terwards
of applying &s;ome Parts of it to pre&s;erve
a ruined Family, whom I had plunder'd, may be
worth reading, if I have Room for it in this Ac|count.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Re&s;olutions I began to be re&s;tored
to &s;ome Degrees of Quiet in my Mind, and
having after almo&s;t three Months Stay at <HI>Ba&s;|&s;ora</HI>
di&s;po&s;ed of &s;ome Goods; but having a
great Quantity left, we hired Boats according
to the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s Direction, and went up to <HI>Bug|dat,</HI>
or <HI>Babylon,</HI> on the River <HI>Tygris,</HI> or rather <HI>Eu|phrates;</HI>
we had a very con&s;iderable Cargo of
Goods with us, and therefore made a great Fi|gure
there, and were receiv'd with Re&s;pect; we
had in Particular, two and Forty Bales of <HI>Indian</HI>
Stuffs of &s;undry Sorts, Silk, Mu&s;lins, and fine
Chints; we had Fifteen Bales of very fine <HI>China</HI>
Silks, and Seventy Packs or Bales of Spices, par|ticularly
Cloves and Nutmegs, with other Goods;
we were bid Money here for our Cloves, but the
<HI>Dutchman</HI> advi&s;ed us not to part with them, and
told us, we &s;hould get a better Price at <HI>Aleppo,</HI>
or in the <HI>Levant,</HI> &s;o we prepared for the Ca|ravan.</P>
<P>We concealed our having any Gold, or Pearls,
as much as we could, and therefore &s;old Three
or Four Bales of <HI>China</HI> Silks, and <HI>Indian</HI> Callicoes,
$o rai&s;e Money to buy Camels, and to pay the
<PB N="336" REF="354">
Cu&s;toms, which are taken at &s;everal Places, and
for our Provi&s;ions over the De&s;arts.</P>
<P>I travelled this Journey carele&s;s to the la&s;t De|gree
of my Goods or Wealth, believing, that as
I came by it all by Rapine and Violence, God
would direct, that it &s;hould be taken from me
again in the &s;ame Manner; and indeed, I think I
might &s;ay, I was very willing it &s;hould be &s;o;
but as I had a merciful Protector above me, &s;o I
had a mo&s;t faithful Steward, Coun&s;ellor, Partner,
or whatever I might call him, who was my Guide,
my Pilot, my Governor, my every thing, and
took care both of me, and of all we had; and
tho' he had never been in any of the&s;e Parts of
the World, yet he took the Care of all upon him;
and in about Nine and Fifty Days we arriv'd
from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> at the Mouth of the River <HI>Tygris</HI>
and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> thro' the De&s;art, and thro' <HI>Aleppo</HI>
to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> or as we call it, <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> in the
<HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>William</HI> and I, and the other two, our
faithful Comrades, debated what we &s;hould do;
and here <HI>William</HI> and I re&s;olved to &s;eparate from
the other Two, they re&s;olving to go with the
<HI>Dutchman</HI> into <HI>Holland,</HI> and by the Means of
&s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship which lay then in the Road:
<HI>William</HI> and I told them, we re&s;olved to go and
&s;ettle in the <HI>Morea,</HI> which then belonged to the
<HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, we acted wi&s;ely in it not to let them
know whither we went, &s;eeing we had re&s;olved
to &s;eparate, but we took our old Doctor's Di|rections
how to write to him in <HI>Holland,</HI> and
in <HI>England,</HI> that we might have Intelligence
from him on Occa&s;ion, and promi&s;ed to give
him an Account how to write to us, which
<PB N="337" REF="355">
we afterwards did, as may in Time be made
out.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd here &s;ome Time after they were
gone, till at length not being thoroughly re&s;olved
whither to go till then, a <HI>Venetian</HI> Ship touch'd at
<HI>Cyprus,</HI> and put in at <HI>Scanderoon</HI> to look for Freight
Home: We took the Hint, and bargaining for our
Pa&s;&s;age, and the Freight of our Goods, we em|bark'd
for <HI>Venice,</HI> where in two and Twenty
Days we arrived &s;afe with all our Trea&s;ure, and
with &s;uch a Cargo, take our Goods, and our Mo|ney,
and our Jewels together, as I believe was
never brought into the City by Two &s;ingle Men,
&s;ince the State of <HI>Venice</HI> had a Being.</P>
<P>We kept our &s;elves here <HI>incognito</HI> for a great
while, pa&s;&s;ing for Two <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants &s;till,
as we had done before; and by this Time we had
gotten &s;o much of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI> Jargon,
which they talk'd at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> and <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and eve|ry
where that we came in the Country, as was
&s;ufficient to make us able to talk to one another,
&s;o as not to be under&s;tood by any Body, though
&s;ometimes hardly by our &s;elves.</P>
<P>Here we converted all our Effects into Money,
&s;ettled our Abode as for a con&s;iderable Time, and
<HI>William</HI> and I maintaining an inviolable Friend&s;hip
and Fidelity to one another, lived like two Bro|thers;
we neither had or &s;ought any &s;eparate In|tere&s;t;
we convers'd &s;eriou&s;ly and gravely, and
upon the Subject of our Repentance continually;
we never changed, that is to &s;ay, &s;o as to leave
off our <HI>Armenian</HI> Garbs, and we were called at <HI>Ve|nice</HI>
the two <HI>Grecians.</HI></P>
<P>I have been two or three times going to give a
Detail of our Wealth, but it will appear incredi|ble,
and we had the greate&s;t Difficulty in the
<PB N="338" REF="356">
World how to conceal it, being ju&s;tly apprehen|&s;ive
le&s;t we might be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in that Country
for our Trea&s;ure; at length <HI>William</HI> told me, he
began to think now that he mu&s;t never &s;ee <HI>Eng|land</HI>
any more, and that indeed he did not much
concern him&s;elf about it; but &s;eeing we had
gained &s;o great a Wealth, and he had &s;ome poor
Relations in <HI>England,</HI> and, if I was willing, he would
write to know if they were living, and to know
what Condition they were in; and if he found
&s;uch of them were alive, as he had &s;ome Thoughts
about, he would, with my Con&s;ent, &s;end them
&s;omething to better their Condition.</P>
<P>I con&s;ented mo&s;t willingly, and accordingly
<HI>William</HI> wrote to a Si&s;ter, and an Uncle, and in
about five Weeks Time receiv'd an An&s;wer from
them both, directed to him&s;elf, under Cover of a
hard <HI>Armenian</HI> Name that he had given him&s;elf,
<HI>viz.</HI> Seignior <HI>Con&s;tantine Alexion of I&s;pahan</HI> at <HI>Ve|nice.</HI></P>
<P>It was a very moving Letter he receiv'd from
his Si&s;ter, who after the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;i|ons
of Joy to hear he was alive, &s;eeing &s;he had
long ago had an Account that he was murthered by
the Pirates in the <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> &s;he intreats him to
let her know what Circum&s;tances he was in; tells
him, &s;he was not in any Capacity to do any thing
con&s;iderable for him, but that he &s;hould be wel|come
to her with all her Heart; that &s;he was left
a Widow with Four Children, but kept a little
Shop in the <HI>Minories,</HI> by which &s;he made &s;hift to
maintain her Family; and that &s;he had &s;ent him
Five Pound, le&s;t he &s;hould want Money in a
&s;trange Country, to bring him Home.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="357">
I could &s;ee the Letter brought Tears out of his
Eyes, as he read it, and indeed when he &s;hewed it
me, and the little Bill for Five Pounds upon an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant in <HI>Venice,</HI> it brought Tears out
of my Eyes too.</P>
<P>After we had been both affected &s;ufficiently
with the Tenderne&s;s and Kindne&s;s of this Letter,
he turns to me, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> what &s;hall I do for this
poor Woman? I mu&s;ed a while, at la&s;t, <HI>&s;ays I&punc;</HI>
I will tell you what you &s;hall do for her; &s;he
has &s;ent you Five Pounds, and &s;he has Four Chil|dren,
and her &s;elf, that's Five; &s;uch a Sum from
a poor Woman in her Circum&s;tances, is as much
as Five Thou&s;and Pounds is to us: You &s;hall &s;end
her a Bill of Exchange for Five Thou&s;and Pounds
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, and bid her conceal her Surprize
at it, till &s;he hears from you again, but bid her
leave off her Shop, and go and take a Hou&s;e &s;ome
where in the Country, not far off from <HI>London,</HI>
and &s;tay there in a moderate Figure, till &s;he hears
from you again.</P>
<P>Now, &s;ays <HI>William,</HI> I perceive by it that you
have &s;ome Thoughts of venturing into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> you mi&s;take me, but it
pre&s;ently occurred to me that you &s;hould venture;
for what have you done that you may not be &s;een
there? Why &s;hould I de&s;ire to keep you from
your Relations purely to keep me Company?</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> look'd very affectionately upon me;
nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we have embarked together &s;o long,
and come together &s;o far, I am re&s;olved I'll never
part with thee as long as I live, go where thou
wilt, or &s;tay where thou wilt; and as for my
Si&s;ter, &s;aid <HI>William,</HI> I cannot &s;end her &s;uch a Sum
of Money; for who&s;e is all this Money we have?
'tis mo&s;t of it thine.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="358">
No, <HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> there is not a Penny of it
mine but what is yours too, and I won't have
any thing but an equal Share with you, and
therefore you &s;hall &s;end it to her, if not, I will
&s;end it.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays William,</HI> it will make the poor Wo|man
di&s;tracted, &s;he will be &s;o &s;urprized, &s;he will
go out of her Wits; well, <HI>&s;aid William,</HI> you may
do it prudently; &s;end her a Bill back'd of a Hun|dred
Pounds, and bid her expect more in a Po&s;t
or two; and that you will &s;end her enough to
live on without keeping Shop, and then &s;end her
more.</P>
<P>Accordingly <HI>William</HI> &s;ent her a very kind Let|ter,
with a Bill upon a Merchant in <HI>London</HI> for a
Hundred and Sixty Pound, and bid her comfort
her &s;elf with the Hope, that he &s;hould be able in
a little Time to &s;end her more. About ten Days
after he &s;ent her another Bill of Five Hundred
and Forty Pound, and a Po&s;t or two after another
for Three Hundred Pound, making in all a Thou|&s;and
Pound; and told her he would &s;end her &s;uf|ficient
to leave off her Shop, and directed her to
take a Hou&s;e, as above.</P>
<P>He waited then till he received an An&s;wer to
all the Three Letters, with an Account, that &s;he
had received the Money, and which I did not
expect, that &s;he had not let any other Acquain|tance
know that &s;he had received a Shilling from
any Body, or &s;o much as that he was alive, and
would not till &s;he heard again.</P>
<P>When he &s;hewed me this Letter, well, <HI>William
&s;aid I,</HI> this Woman is fit to be tru&s;ted with Life
or any thing, &s;end her the re&s;t of the Five Thou|&s;and
Pound; and I'll venture to <HI>England</HI> with you,
to this Woman's Hou&s;e, whenever you will.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="359">
In a Word, we &s;ent her Five Thou&s;and Pound
in good Bills, and &s;he receiv'd them punctually,
and in a little Time &s;ent her Brother Word, that
&s;he had pretended to her Uncle that &s;he was
&s;ickly, and could not carry on the Trade any
longer, and that &s;he had taken a large Hou&s;e
about Four Miles from <HI>London,</HI> under Pretence of
letting Lodgings for her Livelihood; and, in short,
intimated as if &s;he under&s;tood that he intended to
come over to be <HI>Incognito,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him he &s;hould
be as retired as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This was opening the very Door for us, that
we thought had been effectually &s;hut for this Life;
and in a Word, we re&s;olved to venture, but to
keep our &s;elves entirely concealed, both as to
Name, and every other Circum&s;tance; and ac|cordingly
<HI>William</HI> &s;ent his Si&s;ter Word, how
kindly he took her prudent Steps, and that &s;he
had gue&s;&s;ed right, that he de&s;ired to be retired,
and that he obliged her not to increa&s;e her Fi|gure,
but live private, till &s;he might perhaps &s;ee
him.</P>
<P>He was going to &s;end the Letter away; come,
<HI>William, &s;aid I,</HI> you &s;han't &s;end her an empty Let|ter,
tell her, you have a Friend coming with
you, that mu&s;t be as retired as your &s;elf, and I'll
&s;end her Five Thou&s;and Pound more.</P>
<P>So in &s;hort we made this poor Woman's Fami|ly
rich, and yet when it came to the Point, my
Heart failed me, and I dur&s;t not venture, and
for <HI>William,</HI> he would not &s;tir without me, and &s;o
we &s;tayed about two Year after this, con&s;idering
what we &s;hould do.</P>
<P>You may think, perhaps, that I was very pro|digal
of my ill-gotten Goods, thus to load a Stran|ger
with my Bounty, and give a Gift like a
<PB N="342" REF="360">
Prince to one that had been able to merit nothing
of me, or indeed know me: But my Condition
ought to be con&s;idered in this Ca&s;e; though I
had Money to Profu&s;ion, yet I was perfectly de|&s;titute
of a Friend in the World to have the lea&s;t
Obligation or A&s;&s;i&s;tance from, or knew not either
where to di&s;po&s;e or tru&s;t any Thing I had while I
lived, or whom to give it to, if I died.</P>
<P>When I had reflected upon the Manner of my
Getting of it, I was &s;ometimes for giving of it all
to charitable U&s;es, as a Debt due to Mankind,
though I was a Roman-Catholick, and not at all
of the Opinion, that it would purcha&s;e me any
Repo&s;e to my Soul; but I thought, as it was got
by a general Plunder, and which I could make no
Satisfaction for, it was due to the Community,
and I ought to di&s;tribute it for the general Good.
But &s;till I was at a Lo&s;s how, and where, and by
whom to &s;ettle this Charity, not daring to go
Home to my own Country, le&s;t &s;ome of my Com|rades
&s;troled Home &s;hould &s;ee and detect me;
and, for the very Spoil of my Money, or the Pur|cha&s;e
of his own Pardon, betray and expo&s;e me to
an untimely End.</P>
<P>Being thus de&s;titute, I &s;ay, of a Friend, I
pitch'd thus upon <HI>William</HI>'s Si&s;ter; the kind Step
of her's to her Brother, who &s;he thought to be
in Di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ignifying a generous Mind, and a
charitable Di&s;po&s;ition; and having re&s;olved to
make her the Object of my fir&s;t Bounty, I did not
doubt but I &s;hould purcha&s;e &s;omething of a Refuge
for my &s;elf, and a kind of a Centre, to which I
&s;hould tend in my future Actions; for really a
Man that has a Sub&s;i&s;tance, and no Re&s;idence, no
Place that has a Magnetick Influence upon his
Affections, is in one of the mo&s;t odd unea&s;y Con|ditions
<PB N="343" REF="361">
in the World; nor is it in the Power of
all his Money to make it up to him.</P>
<P>It was, as I told you, two Year and upwards,
that we remained at <HI>Venice,</HI> and thereabout, in
the greate&s;t He&s;itation imaginable, irre&s;olute and
unfixed to the la&s;t Degree. <HI>William</HI>'s Si&s;ter im|portuned
us daily to come to <HI>England,</HI> and won|dered
we &s;hould not dare to tru&s;t her, whom we
had to &s;uch a Degree obliged to be faithful; and
in a Manner lamented her being &s;u&s;pected by us.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I began to incline; and I &s;aid to <HI>William,</HI>
Come, Brother <HI>William, &s;aid I, for ever &s;ince our
Di&s;cour&s;e at</HI> Bal&s;ara, <HI>I called him Brother,</HI> if you
will agree to two or three Things with me, I'll go
Home to <HI>England</HI> with all my Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Says William,</HI> let me know what they are.</P>
<P>Why fir&s;t, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you &s;hall not di&s;clo&s;e your
&s;elf to any of your Relations in <HI>England,</HI> but your
Si&s;ter, no not to one.</P>
<P>Secondly, we will not &s;have off our Mu&s;tachoes
or Beards, (for we had all along worn our Beards
after the <HI>Grecian</HI> Manner) nor leave off our long
Ve&s;ts, that we may pa&s;s for <HI>Grecians</HI> and Foreigners.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That we &s;hall never &s;peak <HI>English</HI> in
publick before any body, your Si&s;ter excepted.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That we will always live together,
and pa&s;s for Brothers.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> &s;aid, he would agree to them all with
all his Heart; but that the not &s;peaking <HI>English</HI>
would be the harde&s;t; but he would do his be&s;t
for that too: So, in a Word, we agreed to go
from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> where we verted a large
Sum of Money in Bales of Silk, left a large Sum
in a Merchant's Hands at <HI>Venice,</HI> and another con|&s;iderable
Sum at <HI>Naples,</HI> and took Bills of Ex|change
for a great deal too; and yet we came
<PB N="344" REF="362">
with &s;uch a Cargoe to <HI>London,</HI> as few <HI>American</HI>
Merchants had done for &s;ome Years; for we
loaded in two Ships &s;eventy three Bales of thrown
Silk, be&s;ides thirteen Bales of wrought Silks from
the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> &s;hipt at <HI>Genoa;</HI> with all
which I arrived &s;afely, and &s;ome time after mar|ried
my faithful Protectre&s;s, <HI>William</HI>'s Si&s;ter,
with whom I am much more happy than I de&s;erve.</P>
<P>And now, having &s;o plainly told you, that I
am come to <HI>England,</HI> after I have &s;o boldly own'd
what Life I have led abroad, 'tis Time to leave
off, and &s;ay no more for the pre&s;ent, le&s;t &s;ome
&s;hould be willing to inquire too nicely after</P>
