Dear Jing,

This is an interesting problem; I do not think that we
have encountered it before!

It seems to me that we have *alternative versions* of several
pages. Perhaps pages from two different editions
were bound up together? All we can do is treat these
explicitly as alternative versions, and force them into
<div>s, or perhaps into embedded <text>s, to indicate that.

For the first example, the duplication around pages 43-44,
it seems that two different versions or editions of
pages 43-44 are both found in our image set.

We could use either DIVs or an embedded TEXT. Either would
work, but I think the embedded TEXT (within <P>) is a
little simpler. I suggest something like this:

<DIV TYPE="section" N="5">...
(beginning of section up to the problem bit . . . . )
(image 72, pg 42)
(image 73, pg 43)
(image 74, pg 44)
  <TEXT><BODY>
  <DIV1 TYPE="alternative version of pp 43-44">
  <PB REF="75" N="43">
  (image 76 = duplicate of image 74. Capture as <GAP>)
  (image 77 = duplicate of image 75. Capture as <GAP>)
  <PB REF="78" N="44">
  </DIV1></BODY></TEXT>
(image 79, pg 45)
... etc. ...

--------

The next problem (sect. 7) is a little different, because we
have two complete versions of an entire section. The pages need
to be reassembled in the correct order, but they all seem to be
there (note the strange sequence of image numbers). It would
probably be easiest to capture this section using subordinate
divs rather than an embedded text, like this:

<DIV1 TYPE="section" N="7">
  <DIV2 TYPE="alternative version" N="1">
  <PB REF="87" N="53">
  <HEAD>SECTION VII. <HI>Their former Value.</HI></HEAD>

  <PB REF="97" N="57">

  </DIV2>

  <DIV2 TYPE="alternative version" N="2">
  <PB REF="89" N="53">
  <HEAD>SECTION VII. <HI>Their former Value.</HI></HEAD>
  <P>In estimating the former ... as of the latter.</P> [<P>The]

  <PB REF="95" N="57">
  farthings of our money ... near the Imperial aera.
  </DIV12>
</DIV1>

----

IN the next section (sect. 8), it appears that there is an
alternative version of only the first page of the section,
which makes it more like the problem at pp. 43-44.
Again I suggest using an embedded TEXT to solve the problem.
(Note that image 97 actually belongs in the previous
section, as indicated above).

In general, yes, you should ignore pages that do not
belong at all to the book. But in this case I have looked
through the image set and cannot find a stray page 4.
Do you happen to know which image it is? (i.e. the image
number or file number of the tiff?)

I hope this helps!

Yours,

Paul

<P>AN ESSAY ON MEDALS.</P>

<PB N="iii" REF="2">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as the &s;tudy of medals, at|tending the other arts and &s;ciences upon their revival in Europe, became any thing prevalent, books aiming, like this, to contain general principles of that branch of knowledge likewi&s;e appeared. In Italy, where collections of ancient coins were fir&s;t formed, it was natural that works of this kind &s;hould ari&s;e. Accordingly, in 1548<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Others &s;ay 1555; they had not &s;een the fir&s;t edition of the Giolito, Vinegia, 1548, 4to.</NOTE>, Enea Vico publi&s;hed his Di&s;cour&s;es on the Medals of the Ancients; a treati&s;e of good
<PB N="iv" REF="3">method, and large intelligence for that pe|riod. He therein treats of the metals em|ployed in ancient coinage; of portraits to be found on coins; of the types on their rever&s;es; of their legends; of medallions; of fal&s;e medals, and rules for di&s;cerning them; dates of hi&s;tory; forms of edifices; names of magi&s;trates, &amp;c. His example was imitated in France by Antoine le Pois, who in 1579 gave his Di&s;cour&s;e on the Coins and Seals of the Ancients; of which the dry and verbo&s;e method is compen|&s;ated by the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plates which perhaps ever attended a medallic work.</P>
<P>Tho the&s;e productions had merit, yet they had an unnece&s;&s;ary length, and pe|dantic formality of erudition. The&s;e faults became the more &s;triking as &s;cience advanced, and pedantry, of con&s;equence, began to di&s;appear; for the latter is only the &s;chool-ma&s;ter of the former, and as &s;cience attains to maturity, their acquaint|ance cea&s;es of cour&s;e. When a man is in
<PB N="v" REF="4">the rudiments of any knowledge, how full he is of it! how importantly he talks of it! but, as he advances, it becomes fami|liar, and he wears it ea&s;ily about him. In like manner countries have their pedantry, as well as individuals; it being the nece&s;|&s;ary attendant of the introduction of &s;cience.</P>
<P>A &s;mall work therefore, which &s;hould di&s;play brief and ea&s;y in&s;tructions for the intelligence of coins, being &s;till very much wanted, in 1665 Charles Patin, &s;on of the celebrated Guy Patin phy&s;ician to the French king, and a very &s;kilful medalli&s;t, publi&s;hed his Hi&s;tory of Medals, or Intro|duction to that Science. This treati&s;e, of which the la&s;t edition, 1695, is, in my opinion, much &s;uperior to the work of Jobert, next to be mentioned, ran thro many editions, and was tran&s;lated into all the languages of Europe.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the high merit of this work, and its va&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, in 1692 Pere
<PB N="vi" REF="5">Jobert pre&s;ented to the public his <HI>Science des Medailles;</HI> a title &s;urely the mo&s;t im|pudent that ever &s;tood at the head of any book. Patin had mode&s;tly called his an Introduction to the &s;cience; but Jobert's was the &s;cience it&s;elf; and the book cor|re&s;ponds to the title, being every way worthy of a Je&s;uit, and replete with the mo&s;t glaring plagiari&s;m from Patin, whom he does not mention above once. But &s;uch is the preference of impudence over mode&s;ty, that his book effectually &s;up|planted that of Patin, and has &s;tood its ground ever &s;ince, pa&s;&s;ing thro many edi|tions, and being tran&s;lated into mo&s;t lan|guages. Every book&s;eller will tell us, that literature is a lottery; and the ob&s;er|vation was never more verified than in this in&s;tance. It is proper to add, that the very fir&s;t edition of Jobert is the be&s;t of tho&s;e publi&s;hed by him&s;elf; for that of 1715, which he publi&s;hed in two vo|lumes, is only &s;welled with impertinence, and the crude reveries of Pere Hardouin,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">whom the author wi&s;hed to flatter. The edition of 1739 is doubtle&s;s the very be&s;t; but this we owe to the editor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. le Baron Bimard de la Ba&s;tie; the <HI>Bimardus, Bare Bimar|dus,</HI> and <HI>Bimardus de la Ba&s;tie,</HI> of Froelich's <HI>Notitia.</HI></NOTE>, and not to the author; and even of this edition the &s;econd volume is a mere farrago of u&s;ele&s;s lumber.</P>
<P>In the very year that Jobert publi&s;hed his book, one, &s;omething &s;imilar, fir&s;t ap|peared in the Engli&s;h language<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is a Latin bauble, <HI>De Nummis,</HI> a&s;cribed to our great Selden, of which he is quite innocent. It was written by Alex|ander Sardo, of Ferrara, and publi&s;hed at Mentz, 1575, 4to, tho re-publi&s;hed at London, about 1676, by &s;ome villainous editor, under the name of <HI>Seldenus de Nummis.</HI> Labbe's <HI>Bibliotheca Nummaria</HI> is annexed to it, and they are both of a piece, and fit only to wrap pa&s;try.</NOTE>. It's title is, <Q>The Greek and Roman Hi&s;tory &startq;illu&s;trated by Coins and Medals, repre|&s;enting their Religions, Rites, &amp;c. &amp;c. By O. W. [Obadiah Walker]. Lon|don, &endq;1692.</Q> 12mo. The work an|&s;wers to the title in one re&s;pect; that, of 360 pages, not 60 are medallic; the re&s;t
<PB N="viii" REF="7">are all made up of Roman antiquities and hi&s;tory: but how it illu&s;trates Greek hi&s;|tory cannot be di&s;covered. It's plan is &s;o very confu&s;ed and bad, and the whole work &s;o feeble, that it is no wonder that it never had any &s;ucce&s;s. In 1695 a tran&s;|lation of Jobert's work appeared, inti|tuled, "The Knowledge of Medals," which is a&s;cribed to Walker.</P>
<P>The <Q>Numi&s;mata, or Di&s;cour&s;e of &startq;&endq;Medals, ancient and modern,</Q> by Mr. Evelyn, was printed in 1697. The &s;ize is folio, and the plan and writing are likewi&s;e in folio. That gentleman's &s;tyle is &s;o very uncouth and unintelligible, that, while he wrote upon every thing, he ought to have written about the black art only; but in this work he <HI>outdoes his former out-doings;</HI> for it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to know his meaning if he did not know it before. None of his ob&s;ervations are new, but all tacitly taken from Vico, Le Pois, Patin, and Jobert. The plates of Engli&s;h me|dals
<PB N="ix" REF="8">are of little u&s;e, now that tho&s;e of Snelling have appeared. Even they would have been better under&s;tood, had he not added explanations. There is, in the Bri|ti&s;h Mu&s;eum, a copy of this work, cor|rected by the author, with an original let|ter prefixed, complaining that the printer had utterly mangled and &s;poiled his work, &s;o that it is nece&s;&s;ary to give corrections. The corrections are for the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>In 1720 Nicolao Haym, an Italian fiddler, publi&s;hed at London his <HI>Te&s;oro Britannico,</HI> or Briti&s;h Trea&s;ury, in Italian and Engli&s;h; in which he propo&s;ed to en|grave and de&s;cribe, in about twelve quarto volumes, all the coins, &s;tatues, gems, &amp;c. to be found in cabinets in England, and not before made public. He has accord|ingly given two volumes of Greek and Roman coins, with <HI>his</HI> explanations. But what explanations! If but a letter ap|pears on a coin, he can a&s;certain to what name that letter belongs; if but a no&s;e,
<PB N="x" REF="9">he will find a face to it; if the coin is quite bare, to divine its ancient forms co&s;ts him not a thought. Medals and au|thors are mi&s;repre&s;ented, as objects in the eyes of a madman. With the help of Diogenes Laertius he will find all the phi|lo&s;ophers of Greece upon old coins! Yet the reveries of this ra&s;h <HI>for&s;ennato</HI> have been followed with much reverence by medallic writers, while to people of &s;en&s;e they afford laughter, and utter di&s;gu&s;t. Khell, a German medalli&s;t of &s;ome credit, has even lately republi&s;hed Haym's &s;trange ma&s;s in Latin, with additions. But had he in&s;pected the original medals, or known the character which that pitiful work bears here, where only it can be duly e&s;timated, or indeed been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any judgment, he would not have incurred the imputation of trying to perpetuate the gro&s;s errors of &s;o very fooli&s;h a bauble. As Haym pre|tends to mark the rarity, &amp;c. of many of the coins he produces, his work was en|titled to notice here.</P>
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
<P>Did not my de&s;ign in this preface in|duce me to enumerate every Engli&s;h work, in particular, which has appeared of this kind, I &s;hould pa&s;s in &s;ilent contempt that called <Q>An Introduction to the Know|ledge &startq;of Medals, by the late Reverend David Jennings, D. D. printed by Ba&s;k|erville, &endq;1764,</Q> 12mo. But this being the only other attempt in the language, it is nece&s;&s;ary to mention it in few words. It con&s;i&s;ts only of about 60 pages, mo&s;t of which are taken up with Jewi&s;h &s;hekels and divinity, <HI>as in duty bound to pray.</HI> The only apology which can be made for it is, that it was drawn up by the author, as would &s;eem, without the mo&s;t di&s;tant view of publication; but was &s;ent <HI>into the breathing world, not half made up,</HI> by &s;ome officious friend. It's innumerable blunders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To in&s;tance a few, he tells us that all ancient coins were fir&s;t ca&s;t in molds, then &s;tamped; that there were &s;ometimes five mint|ma&s;ters; that S. C. is on all medals; that an altar on a coin of Augu&s;tus is a gate; that <HI>Votis XXX. mult. XXXX.</HI> implies a wi&s;h that the emperor may live 30 years and 40 more. He &s;eems to &s;ay that all the Roman emperors appear with diadems. He certainly had never &s;een a dozen coins; nor a &s;ingle medallic writer of this century.</NOTE> and holy verbo&s;ity, &s;tamp it
<PB N="xii" REF="11">the mo&s;t childi&s;h work which ever appear|ed in any &s;cience whatever.</P>
<P>From this deduction the reader will per|ceive how much a treati&s;e of this kind was wanted, in our language in particular; tho indeed &s;uch a work has been univer|&s;ally known to be needed, and much wi&s;hed for, during this whole century. How far the pre&s;ent may an&s;wer the in|tention, or expectation, the reader mu&s;t judge; tho if he does not condemn, it will not be owing to the want of previous in&s;tructions; for I am well aware that nothing is more provocative of critici&s;m than any attempt of which the author cri|tici&s;es his predece&s;&s;ors. But, as this is a work of in&s;truction, it was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to point out the faults of others, that they might be avoided.</P>
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
<P>The le&s;s an author &s;ays at any time about his own productions the better; &s;o it &s;hall only be added, that, tho this little e&s;&s;ay was begun as a mere amu&s;ement and relief from idlene&s;s; yet I &s;oon found that infinite labour was required to an&s;wer my own expectations. As it is di&s;agreeable to relinqui&s;h a de&s;ign when entered upon, this toil has not been &s;pared. Indeed the reader will hardly believe how much at|tention is required in a work of this kind, for every page almo&s;t contains a number of minute facts, for each of which con&s;i|derable information is nece&s;&s;ary: in&s;omuch that perhaps in two or three lines the fruit of much re&s;earch into a dozen or two of authors is pre&s;ented. Hence mi&s;takes are unavoidable; and tho all po&s;&s;ible pre|vention has been u&s;ed, yet many errors may have crept in; any of which, if the reader will point out in a letter, inclo&s;ed to the care of the publi&s;her, the admo|nition will be mo&s;t thankfully accepted;
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">and, &s;hould the work attain another edi|tion, be followed by a removal of the fault.</P>
<P>They who wi&s;h to proceed in this &s;ci|ence may next peru&s;e the mo&s;t excellent and u&s;eful work of Froelich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>&startq;Notitia Elementaris Numi&s;matum antiquorum illorum, quae Urbium Liberarum, Regum et Principum, ac Per&s;onarum &endq;Illu&s;trium, appellantur. Viennae, Pragae, et Terge&s;ti, 1758,</Q> 4to. This work is, however, not without faults; the li&s;t of Greek cities of which we have coins is defective in about a third of the number; and the plan of &s;plitting the &s;eries of kings of every realm into different epochs is execrable. A more minute fault is, his giving plated coins the title of <HI>bracteati,</HI> a name be|longing to a very different kind, as the reader will &s;ee in Section XVIII. of this work. <HI>Nummi lamella argentea obducti</HI> was the proper phra&s;e for plated coins.</NOTE>, and after|wards &s;uch books of medals as they plea&s;e, in chronological order as publi&s;hed, from Goltzius down to Pellerin and Combe. I &s;cruple not to recommend Goltzius, tho all his works have many coins not yet found in cabinets, his own being unfortu|nately lo&s;t, becau&s;e medals which he de|&s;cribes, and which were looked upon as fictitious, are yearly found really exi&s;tent,
<PB N="xv" REF="14">and of undoubted antiquity. A French writer compares him to Pliny the natural hi&s;torian, who was thought to deal much in fal&s;ehood, till Time drew his truth out of the well; &s;o that, as knowledge ad|vances, mo&s;t of his wonders acquire gra|dual confirmation. For modern coins and medals, the authors who have treated tho&s;e of each particular country mu&s;t be con&s;ulted; the Engli&s;h, in particular, ap|pear, in Snelling's Works, and Folkes's Tables, to an advantage which will not be &s;oon &s;urpa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As the reader may, however, expect &s;ome directions for his medallic &s;tudies, I &s;hall beg leave to offer him a li&s;t of what authors have appeared to me the be&s;t, after a peru&s;al of almo&s;t every work publi&s;hed in this line, from a duodecimo pamphlet to two volumes folio, and from the begin|ning of the &s;ixteenth century to the pre|&s;ent hour. Perhaps this e&s;timate may be thought too &s;evere, when the &s;hortne&s;s of
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">my li&s;t is con&s;idered; but I will venture to &s;ay, that in no &s;cience whatever have &s;o many bad books, and &s;o few good ones, been given as in this. At the &s;ame time, if the reader wi&s;hes to enlarge his &s;tudies, he may plea&s;e his fancy; all that I &s;hall do here is, to give him a &s;hort catalogue of the be&s;t medallic productions, and the be&s;t editions of them.</P>
<P>For the general &s;cience I mu&s;t recom|mend Vico's work, <HI>Di&s;cor&s;i &s;opra le Me|daglie de gli antichi;</HI> be&s;t editions are, <HI>Vi|negia,</HI> 1555, 4to, and <HI>Parigi,</HI> 1622, 4to: and Patin's <HI>Hi&s;toire des Medailles, ou In|troduction a la connoi&s;&s;ance de cette Science;</HI> be&s;t edition is of Paris, 1695, 12mo.</P>
<P>The &s;tudy of the Greek coins may be begun with Goltzius, <HI>Hi&s;toria Siciliae et Magnae Graeciae ex antiquis Numi&s;matibus,</HI> Antwerpiae, 1644, folio. Recour&s;e may then be had to Ge&s;&s;ner's <HI>The&s;aurus Numi&s;|matum,</HI> Tiguri, 1738, two volumes folio.
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">This work contains all the Greek and Ro|man coins publi&s;hed by every preceding author, and con&s;i&s;ts entirely of copper-plates, with printed explanations of only the Greek kings, tho the civic coins are likewi&s;e explained in copper-plates. The Roman medals, which compo&s;e the &s;econd volume, are not illu&s;trated at all. It is a pity that many of the coins are not in exact order, in the beginning of the fir&s;t volume, and that the author has been fooli&s;h enough to give us many of the forged coins, tho he always marks them as &s;uch; but, upon the whole, this is the be&s;t medallic work of general reference ever publi&s;hed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The work of Ge&s;&s;ner is rare, and, when met with, is very &s;eldom complete. Such copies as have fallen in my way go no lower than Philip the &s;on; later coins will be found in Banduri.</NOTE>. The productions of Pellerin, Paris, 1762, and following years, till 1778, ought next to be peru&s;ed, mak|ing, with all the &s;upplements, ten quarto volumes. The&s;e volumes chiefly contain coins never before publi&s;hed, and are ju&s;tly
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">held in high e&s;teem. I believe it is to M. Pellerin that we are indebted for the fir&s;t plates of medals, perfectly repre&s;ent|ing the originals in every flaw and irregu|larity of edge and impre&s;&s;ion, which is a mo&s;t capital improvement, and makes the view of &s;uch plates almo&s;t equal to that of the coins them&s;elves. Mr. Combe's publication of Dr. Hunter's coins of Greek cities, London, 1782, 4to, as it is the la&s;t, &s;o it is the very be&s;t of the kind ever yet given. The plan of pre&s;enting the weight, metal, and &s;ize of every coin, in marginal columns, cannot be enough prai&s;ed, as every u&s;e may be made of a de&s;cription &s;o arranged that can be drawn from the coins them&s;elves.</P>
<P>For the Greek monarchic coins Ge&s;&s;ner may be referred to, as the mo&s;t ample a&s;|&s;emblage; and a few additional coins may be found in the authors mentioned in Sec|tion II. of this work, Froelich's <HI>Notitia,</HI> and Pellerin. We mu&s;t regret that the
<PB N="xix" REF="18">medals of Greek princes in Dr. Hunter's cabinet are not publi&s;hed, as they form the large&s;t and be&s;t collection of that kind in the world, being infinitely &s;uperior to that of the French king.</P>

<P>The imperial coins of Rome are like|wi&s;e very amply di&s;played by Ge&s;&s;ner; tho along with him, for the rare coins, &s;hould be read Vaillant's <HI>Numi&s;mata Im|peratorum Romanorum,</HI> publi&s;hed by Bal|dini at Rome, 1743, 3 volumes 4to; and Khell's <HI>Numi&s;mata Imperatorum Romano|rum,</HI> Vindobonae, 1767, 4to, being a &s;up|plement to the Roman edition of Vaillant.

<P>Of books on modern coins and me|dals the fir&s;t which ought to be peru&s;ed by a Briti&s;h &s;ubject are tho&s;e relating to his own country. He cannot begin better than with Mr. Clarke's <Q>Connexion of &startq;the Roman, Saxon, and Engli&s;h Coins,
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">&endq;London, 1767,</Q> 4to. A good work on Briti&s;h and Saxon coins, with prints, is much wanted; but as none now exi&s;ts, let us pa&s;s to the Engli&s;h: and in the very fir&s;t place may be recommended Mr. Lowndes's excellent <Q>Report, containing &startq;an E&s;&s;ay for the Amendment of the Silver &endq;Coins,</Q> publi&s;hed by order of govern|ment at London in 1695, 8vo; a produc|tion, tho &s;hort, yet full of the mo&s;t valua|ble and authentic information. Then Snel|ling's Views of Engli&s;h Money, London, 1763, and following years, 4to, ought to be peru&s;ed, and followed by Folkes's Ta|bles of Engli&s;h Coin, London, 1763, 4to, correcting the errors of either work, by means of the other. Ducarel's Letters on Anglo-Gallic Coins are very commendable, and &s;ingularly intere&s;ting to every one con|cerned in the ancient glory of this country. Engli&s;h medals are publi&s;hed by Snelling, and in Vertue's account of Simon's works. On the Scoti&s;h coins the only books are tho&s;e of Ander&s;on and Snelling, neither of
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">them laudable. The Iri&s;h are well di&s;play|ed by Simon, in his Hi&s;torical E&s;&s;ay on Iri&s;h Coin, Dublin, 1749, 4to, with the Supplement.</P>
<P>With regard to other modern countries, the coins of France are be&s;t &s;tudied in Le Blanc's <HI>Trait&egrave; Hi&s;torique des Monnoies de France,</HI> Paris, 1689, or Am&s;terdam &s;ame year, both editions in 4to. The ancient coins of Spain will be found to much ad|vantage in the work of Florez, called <HI>Me|dallas de las Colonias, Municipios y Pueblos antiguos de E&s;pana, con las de los reyes Godos,</HI> 3 tom. 4to; the two fir&s;t were pub|li&s;hed in 1757, the la&s;t in 1773. On the more modern Spani&s;h coins I know of no treati&s;e to recommend. The papal medals were publi&s;hed at Rome in 1696, 2 vo|lumes folio. The German coins, tho many authors have written in the German language about them, are not given in any good work, written in a language of more general intelligence. The Swedi&s;h coins
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">are di&s;played in Brenner's <HI>The&s;aurus Num|morum Sueo-Gothorum,</HI> Holmiae, 1731, 4to. Bizot's <HI>Hi&s;toire Medallique de la Hollande</HI> gives the medals &s;truck by the United Provinces, for few readers will have phlegm enough to read Van Loon's five folio vo|lumes, of which a French tran&s;lation was publi&s;hed at the Hague in 1732. On the coins of the &s;everal Ea&s;tern countries, and tho&s;e of the &s;maller &s;tates in Europe, dif|ferent treati&s;es have been publi&s;hed, but, as they are little intere&s;ting, it were need|le&s;s to enumerate them.</P>
<P>Such is the li&s;t of almo&s;t all the works, worth attention, which have been written on this &s;cience. Mo&s;t of the others the reader will not peru&s;e with impunity, as he will croud his memory with many errors, which it will require much &s;tudy for him to eradicate. Pamphlets upon &s;ingle medals, and the like, are commonly written by the authors only to &s;hew that old women are not the only per&s;ons who can &s;ay a great deal upon nothing. The&s;e
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23">particularly &s;warm; and I will be bold to &s;ay that not one of them de&s;erves peru&s;al, even tho the name of a fir&s;t-rate medallic author &s;tands at the head of it.</P>
<P>This preface cannot be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with|out offering a remark upon the pedantry which, to this day, &s;o prevails in this &s;ci|ence. They who make a pur&s;uit of it, ought to reflect that, tho it is a mo&s;t in|nocent pur&s;uit, and &s;uch as never engaged the attention of a bad man, it is yet a far more laudable amu&s;ement. They ought, in con&s;equence, not to make of it an arti|cle of faith, but to treat all the parts of it with coolne&s;s and candour, as matters of the mere&s;t indifference, and certainly of no nece&s;&s;ity or importance. In&s;tead of this, the conver&s;ation of &s;ome medalli&s;ts is com|monly vehement about trifles, and con|demnatory of every opinion, of either liv|ing or dead authors, which accords not with their own. Like other pedants, they are fierce and &s;tern: for there are
<PB N="xxv" REF="24">many analogies between men and other animals, and none &s;tronger than this, that they get fierce from being kept in the dark.</P>
<P>The French medalli&s;ts treat the &s;cience with more politene&s;s, tho they carry the attachment to a height unknown to us; as may be judged from the very late ex|ample of M. Pellerin, a man of great wealth, who was &s;o fond of medals as to continue to write upon the &s;ubject after he was blind with age. This he did by means of an invention de&s;cribed in the la&s;t volume of his works. The French fa&s;hion is now beginning to be followed among us; and many of the pre&s;ent medalli&s;ts are no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by their knowledge than by their mode&s;t and liberal communication of it; &s;o that it is to be hoped that, in a very &s;hort time, the pedantic &s;pirit which has &s;o long infe&s;ted this &s;cience will totally di&s;appear.</P>

<P>THE amu&s;ement ari&s;ing from medals is &s;o common and univer&s;al, that we meet with few people who have not formed a little collec|tion of &s;ome kind or other. As no axiom is looked upon as more certain than that even the minute&s;t principles of the human mind have been the &s;ame in all ages, we mu&s;t be induced to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;tudy of medals is almo&s;t as ancient as medals them&s;elves. We find not, however, in ancient writers, the &s;lighte&s;t hint of collections of this kind. But many &s;mall par|ticulars of the manners and cu&s;toms of the an|cients are pa&s;&s;ed without notice in their writers.
<PB N="2" REF="32">Indeed, in the days of Greece, a collection of &s;uch coins as then exi&s;ted mu&s;t have been re|garded as no valuable acqui&s;ition, con&s;i&s;ting only of tho&s;e &s;truck by the innumerable little States then u&s;ing the Greek characters and lan|guage. This would give them an air of do|me&s;tic coinage; and make them be regarded with an eye of little curio&s;ity, however exqui|&s;ite their impre&s;&s;ions. Add to this the &s;mall in|tercour&s;e between different provinces and coun|tries during that period, and we &s;hall not won|der that if a traveller or two collected a few hundred coins, yet none of their fellow-citizens thought &s;uch a minute anecdote worth commit|ting to writing.</P>
<P>If we pa&s;s to the Romans, the only other people of antiquity in who&s;e writings we can expect any information of this kind, we &s;hall find that, almo&s;t as &s;oon as any communication was opened between them and the Greeks, the future &s;overeigns of the world treated the Gre|cian art, di&s;played in the minute&s;t, as well as in the large&s;t works of that ingenious nation, with due di&s;tinction and applau&s;e. The Grecian coins were imitated by the Roman workmen, and pre&s;erved in the cabinets of their &s;enators, among the choice&s;t trea&s;ures. The fir&s;t cir|cum&s;tance we learn from the Roman medals of that period; and the latter from Suetonius, who tells us that Augu&s;tus u&s;ed, on &s;olemn occa|&s;ions,
<PB N="3" REF="33">to pre&s;ent his friends with medals of fo|reign &s;tates and princes, along with other the mo&s;t valuable te&s;timonies of his love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Saturnalibus, et &s;i quando alias libui&s;&s;er, modo mun$ta divi|debat, ve&s;tem, et aurum, et argentum; modo nummos omnis notae, et$am veteres regios ac peregrinos. Sueton. in Aug. n. 75.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a more advanced period of the Roman empire, we know that individuals mu&s;t have formed &s;erie&s;es of Roman coins; for a complete &s;eries of &s;ilver was lately found in our i&s;land, containing all the emperors down to Carau&s;ius, inclu&s;ive<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stukeley's Medallic Hi&s;tory of Carau&s;ius; an author whom facts alone can ju&s;tify my quoting.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the decline of the Roman empire a total darkne&s;s envelopes every branch of &s;ci|ence, till the revival of literature in the end of the fifteenth century. Indeed, while the Chri&s;|tian dominion of Con&s;tantinople la&s;ted, which was near twelve unhappy centuries, it may be pronounced to have &s;tood the very palladium and &s;anctuary of ignorance and of barbari&s;m. No fine art flouri&s;hed in any kingdom during that gloomy period. But as &s;oon as Con&s;tan|tinople fell a prey to the Turks, that &s;hrine of ignorance, with the godde&s;s her&s;elf, became their portion; and &s;cience, as at the breaking of a tali&s;man, &s;tood confe&s;t all over Europe in an|cient glory.</P>
<P>During a glimmering twilight which pre|ceeded this radiant morning, literature was a
<PB N="4" REF="34">little cultivated in Italy. And &s;o intimate and nece&s;&s;ary a connection has now the &s;tudy of medals with that of ancient erudition, that, on the very earlie&s;t appearance of a revival of the latter, the former was al&s;o di&s;clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>For we find that Petrarca, one of the very fir&s;t men in Europe who in modern times a&s;pired to the celebrity of learning and of ge|nius, was likewi&s;e the fir&s;t to in&s;titute an ex|ample of the &s;cience of medals. This eminent writer being de&s;ired by the Emperor Charles IV. to compo&s;e a book containing the lives of il|lu&s;trious men, and to place him in the li&s;t, with a noble pride an&s;wered, that he would comply with this de&s;ire whenever the emperor's future life and actions de&s;erved it. Taking occa&s;ion from this, he &s;ent that monarch a collection of gold and &s;ilver coins of celebrated men, as he tells us in his epi&s;tles. "Behold," &s;ays he to the emperor, <Q>to what men you have &s;uc|ceeded! &startq;Behold whom you &s;hould imitate and admire! To who&s;e very form and image you &s;hould compo&s;e your talents! The inva|luable pre&s;ent I &s;hould have given to nobody but you: it was due to you alone. I can only know or de&s;cribe the deeds of the&s;e great men. Your &s;upreme office enables you &endq;to imitate them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecce, Cae&s;ar, quibus &s;ucce&s;&s;i&s;ti. Ecce quos imita$i &s;tudeas, et mirari: ad quorum formulam et imaginem to componas: quos, pretor to unum, nulli hominum daturus eram: tua me movit authoritas. Licet enim ho$um motes et nomina, horum ego res ge&s;tas norim; tuum e&s;t, non modum no&s;&s;e, &s;ed &s;equi. T$hi itaque debebantur. Lib. x. epi&s;t. 3.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<PB N="5" REF="35">
<P>In the next age Alphon&s;o king of Arragon cau&s;ed all the ancient coins, that could be di&s;|covered throughout the whole provinces of Italy, to be collected. The collection, however, mu&s;t not have been very large, as it was placed in an ivory cabinet, and always carried with him. The author of his life informs us, that Alphon&s;o confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf excited to great actions by the pre&s;ence, as it were, of &s;o many illu&s;trious men in their images.</P>
<P>Anthony Cardinal of St. Mark, nephew of Eugene IV. who a&s;cended the pontifical chair in 1431, had a va&s;t collection. Soon after this, Co&s;mo de Medici began the grand mu&s;eum of the family of the Medici at Florence; as the mo&s;t ancient, &s;o the mo&s;t noble, in the univer&s;e. Among a profu&s;ion of other monuments of an|cient art, coins and medals were not neglected. About the &s;ame period Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, formed a noble collection of coins, along with ancient manu&s;cripts and other va|luable reliques of antiquity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For &s;ome of the&s;e in&s;tances the author is indebted to the pre|face of the la&s;t edition of La Science des Meda$lles, Paris, 1739, 2 vols. 12mo.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hitherto, however, no writer had ever thought of examining the &s;ubject of ancient
<PB N="6" REF="36">medals. I take the celebrated Agnolo Poli|ziano, more known by the Latin appellation of Angelus Politianus, to be the very fir&s;t who even adduced them as vouchers of ancient or|thography and cu&s;toms. In his Mi&s;cellanea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. 19.58. &amp;c. Ba&s;il. 1522. 12mo.</NOTE>, written about 1490, he cites different coins of the Mediccan collection, then devolved to Lau|rence de Medicis, duke of Florence, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the great Co&s;mo.</P>
<P>Maximilian I. emperor of Germany, having formed a cabinet of medals, Joannes Hutti|chius was enabled, by its means, to publi&s;h a book of the lives of the emperors, enriched with their portraits, delineated from ancient coins. This book, which is thought to be the fir&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Labb&eacute;, however, in his Bibliotheca Nummaria, mentions a work, called <HI>Illu&s;trium Imagines,</HI> by one Andreas Fulvius, printed in 1$17, in which, as would appear, mo&s;t of the portraits are from medals.</NOTE>of the kind, was printed in 1525, reprinted in 1534, and in 1537 a third edition appeared, with the addition of forty-two con&s;ular medals, engraved on wood. Prior to this, however, and about 1512, Guillaume Bud&eacute;, a French writer, had written his treati&s;e De A&s;&s;e, though it was not printed till many years afterwards.</P>
<P>M. Grollier, trea&s;urer of the armies of France in Italy during part of the &s;ixteenth century, had a great collection of coins in all metals. De Thou tells us, in his Hi&s;tory of his own
<PB N="7" REF="37">times, that, after the death of Grollier, his bra&s;s medals were carried from Paris into Pro|vence, and were about to be &s;ent to Italy, when the King of France, being informed of this tran&s;action, gave orders that they &s;hould be &s;topped, and bought them at a high price for his own cabinet of antiquities. Be&s;ides the me|dals of bra&s;s mentioned by De Thou, M. Grollier had an a&s;&s;ortment of gold and &s;ilver. The cabinet containing them fell, two centu|ries afterwards, into the hands of M. L'Abb&eacute; de Rothelin; and was known to have been that of Grollier from &s;ome &s;lips of paper on which was his u&s;ual in&s;cription for his books, "Jo|annis Grollierii et amicorum."</P>
<P>Guillaume du Choul was the contemporary of Grollier, and likewi&s;e a man of di&s;tinction and fortune. He had a good collection of me|dals, and publi&s;hed many in his treati&s;e on the religion of the ancient Romans, printed at Ly|ons in 1557.</P>
<P>The letters of Era&s;mus &s;hew that the &s;tudy of medals was begun, in the Low Countries, about the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century. About the middle of that century, Hubertus Goltzius, a printer and engraver, travelled over a great part of Europe in &s;earch of coins and medals, for works, relating to them, which he intended to publi&s;h. In the prole|gomena to his life of Julius Cae&s;ar, publi&s;hed
<PB N="8" REF="38">as a &s;pecimen of larger works in con&s;equence of the&s;e re&s;earches, he addre&s;&s;es an epi&s;tle to all the antiquaries who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, or who&s;e ca|binets he vi&s;ited. This epi&s;tle contains a li&s;t of collectors, and their places of re&s;idence; by which it appears that, in the middle of the &s;ix|teenth century, there were, in the Low Coun|tries, 200 cabinets of medals; 175 in Germany; more than 380 in Italy; and about 200 in France. A prodigious number! but which now may be fairly quadrupled, I imagine, for the&s;e countries, with the addition of 500 for our own, which we mu&s;t regret that Goltzius did not vi&s;it.</P>
<P>It is not, however, to be doubted that, while the other kingdoms of Europe were &s;o rich in collections, this i&s;land neglected tho&s;e trea&s;ures of antiquity, which the very &s;oil afforded to every labourer. For in few countries in the world, if we except Italy, are more ancient coins found than in Britain; but at what period the &s;tudy of them particularly commenced among the learned here, we are left in the dark. I &s;u&s;pect, however, that Camden was one of the fir&s;t, if not the very fir&s;t, of our writers, who produced medals in his works, and who mu&s;t have had a &s;mall collection.</P>
<P>In the next, being the &s;eventeenth, century, Thomas Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Mar|&s;hal
<PB N="9" REF="39">of England, well known by the Arundelian Tables, and other monuments of antiquity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the cellar of a hou&s;e in Norfolk Street in the Strand, is a fine antique bath, formerly belonging to this Earl of Arundel, who&s;e hou&s;e and va&s;t gardens were adjacent.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Utility of this Study.</HEAD>
<P>IF we ca&s;t an eye over the whole circle of the productions of human genius, perhaps we &s;hall perceive none of &s;uch grand importance and utility to mankind as Hi&s;tory. Mo&s;t of the other efforts of the mind only intere&s;t indivi|duals as &s;uch; but hi&s;tory, when executed with philo&s;ophic candour and propriety, concerns and in&s;tructs whole empires, indeed the whole univer&s;e. By it &s;tate&s;men and &s;tates are taught, from the example of former and other nations, and that of their own in preceding times, to propagate mea&s;ures that contribute to the gene|ral welfare; and to guard again&s;t evils, which are often unfore&s;een, and, in con&s;equence, not warded off, only becau&s;e they are not known to
<PB N="12" REF="42">have exi&s;ted in ancient periods, nor the me|thods inve&s;tigated which then prevented or mi|tigated them.</P>
<P>But the very ba&s;is of hi&s;tory is truth, without which the cau&s;es of human action, nay the ac|tions them&s;elves, are di&s;gui&s;ed, and the in&s;truc|tion, ari&s;ing from the narration, totally lo&s;t, or converted into an empty chimaera. Now the &s;ole evidence we can have of the veracity of an hi&s;torian con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch collateral documents as are palpable to all, and can admit of no fal&s;ifi|cation.</P>
<P>Such, in modern times, are public memoirs, in&s;tructions to amba&s;&s;adors, letters of &s;tate, and the like vouchers; which every per&s;on allows to be irrefragable.</P>
<P>But as the&s;e proofs are &s;ubject to innumerable accidents, mutilation, and utter lo&s;s, their evi|dence cannot be pre&s;umed to extend to very di&s;tant ages.</P>
<P>Add to this that, as &s;uch vouchers mo&s;t com|monly remain in the country who&s;e actions they import, they cannot be &s;atisfactory to the world at large without a degree of faith which, to the &s;evere eye of philo&s;ophy, will appear too large.</P>
<P>Hence monuments of longer duration are re|quired to evince the veracity of ancient hi&s;tory. Such indeed are public buildings, &s;tatues, and in|&s;criptions. But the evidence of the&s;e te&s;timonies, tho it extends to remote ages, does not extend to
<PB N="13" REF="43">remote countries, if we except a very few in|&s;tances of the two la&s;t articles.</P>
<P>The reader mu&s;t have, ere now, recollected, from this deduction, that medals alone remain as the principal proofs of hi&s;toric truth, their evidence reaching at once to the mo&s;t remote ages, and the mo&s;t remote countries.</P>
<P>The va&s;t utility of this &s;tudy is therefore clear, becau&s;e it &s;erves as a ba&s;is to the mo&s;t important of all human &s;ciences.</P>
<P>Perhaps the grounds of this rea&s;oning may be looked upon as more ab&s;tract than exi&s;tent; but a few examples will &s;hew their ju&s;tice and recti|tude. I &s;hould indeed expect the &s;en&s;ible reader's deri&s;ion, if the&s;e examples were &s;uch as are &s;ometimes adduced on this &s;core. Some writers tell us, that, without the &s;cience of an|cient coins, we &s;hould never have known that Antoninus had a &s;on by Fau&s;tina, called Marcus Annius Valerius Antoninus, had not a Greek coin fortunately pre&s;erved the memory of this mo&s;t &s;tupendous event; that we &s;hould never have known that a tyrant called Pacatianus exi&s;ted, without &s;uch a circular record; nor that Barbia Orbiana was the wife of Alexander Severus. A&s;toni&s;hing di&s;coveries! and equally fitted to delight and in&s;truct!</P>

<P>Leaving the&s;e impertinences of crude erudi|tion, let us examine a little what has been ac|tually performed towards an elucidation of dif|ferent parts of ancient hi&s;tory, by means of the &s;tudy of medals.</P>
<P>Vaillant, in his learned hi&s;tory of the kings of Syria, printed at Paris, 1681, &s;et the fir&s;t important example of fixing the dates, and ar|ranging the order of events in ancient hi&s;torians, by means of the&s;e infallible vouchers. By them alone he was enabled to fix, in a very great degree, the chronology and progre&s;s of events of three of the mo&s;t important king|doms of the ancient world, namely, tho&s;e of Egypt, of Syria, and of Parthia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many coins have been di&s;covered of all the&s;e princes &s;ince Vaillant wrote, which further illu&s;trate his provinces of hi&s;tory. His hi&s;tory of the Ar&s;acidae of Parthia is his wor&s;t work; it is in|deed a po&s;thumous one; but he gives too much way to conjecture, as to the many princes on who&s;e coins dates are wanting; which, in that &s;eries, are &s;o numerous that, at this day, only ten princes have been found who&s;e medals &s;ix their epoch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Father Hardouin trod in the &s;ame path, but with a ra&s;hne&s;s which always attends ignorance, though indeed his Series of the Herodiades, or Kings of Judaea, &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Herod, is the mo&s;t unexceptionable of his works. Noris, in his learned treati&s;e on the epochs of the Syro|macedonian princes, and Bayer, in his hi&s;tory of O&s;rho&euml;ne, followed the &s;ame plan, after|wards

<P>But the &s;tudy of the Greek coins, tho it illu&s;trates the chronology of reigns, yet never interprets that of events. This important addi|tion is di&s;played, in all its vigour, in the Ro|man medals; in which, mo&s;t commonly, with the portrait of the prince, and date of his con|&s;ul&s;hip, or of his tribunician power, we have a repre&s;entation, or poetical &s;ymbol, of &s;ome grand event on the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>The Greek medals, &s;truck in the imperial ages, often mark the year of the prince's reign; the Roman, mo&s;t commonly, the number of the emperor's con&s;ul&s;hips, or of his tribunician power. As the latter aera is &s;ometimes mi&s;|taken, by antiquaries, for a mark &s;ynonymous to the year of the emperor's reign, we &s;hall beg leave to offer a few remarks on that &s;ubject, as perhaps a more proper occa&s;ion may not occur.</P>
<P>When Julius Cae&s;ar a&s;&s;umed the &s;upreme power, he dared not to take the title of King, however ardently de&s;irous of &s;o ambitious a di&s;tinction. He was contented with that of
<PB N="16" REF="46">Perpetual Dictator, &s;ynonymous with the for|mer in effect, and, had he been rightly advi&s;ed of an import even more invidious. Certain i$ is, that it nece&s;&s;arily implied his intention never to quit, or even relax his authority; whereas he ought, under the di&s;gui&s;e of &s;ome &s;upreme magi&s;trature of annual election, to have lulled the people with a dream that they might terminate his power when they plea&s;ed; or that he would him&s;elf re&s;ign it when the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;tate, which required his tempo|rary elevation, had &s;ub&s;ided. His power would by this art have been perpetual, without great envy; whereas his open a&s;&s;umption of an empty title &s;ubmitted him to all the malevolence which the utter de&s;pair of the people could &s;upply. He paid for the mi&s;take with his life.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tus, who, with far le&s;s ability than his uncle, had yet that cunning which, in the commerce of life, commonly avails more to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or than great talents, which are indeed always incompatible with it, had the prudence to follow the proper plan. Every per&s;on, the lea&s;t &s;killed in Roman hi&s;tory, knows that there was an office, entru&s;ted at fir&s;t to two plebeians, called The Tribune&s;hip of the People. This was of annual election; and in fact, in any other hands but tho&s;e of plebeians, mu&s;t have been the &s;upreme power in the &s;tate, for it belonged
<PB N="17" REF="47">to that office to put an ab&s;olute negative upon every public mea&s;ure whatever. Augu&s;tus, as of &s;enatorial rank, could not a&s;&s;ume the title of Tribune of the People, but he inve&s;ted him&s;elf with one quite equivalent, Tribunicia Pote&s;tate, that of being endued with tribunician power. This had the advantages formerly pointed out as accruing to an appearance of temporary &s;u|premacy. Towards the end of his reign, he often a&s;&s;umed his de&s;tined &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Tiberius, as a colleague in the office, for it had been for|merly allotted to two, but at fir&s;t he enjoyed it alone, and in all public in&s;truments and records numbered his tribunician power as an annual office. This, with his other artifice of laying down his under&s;tood &s;upreme power, and re|&s;uming it from ten years to ten years, at the de|&s;ire of the Senate, affianced his &s;overeignty to him in perfect &s;ecurity, to the natural end of his life.</P>
<P>This example was followed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; &s;o that the in&s;cription on their coins is almo&s;t always TRIBUNICIA POTESTA$E, among other ti|tles, with the date annexed to it, as TR. POT. VII. &amp;c. Yet, tho this date far mo&s;t generally im|plies the year of the emperor's reign, it however &s;ometimes happens that the emperor was, by the &s;pecial favour of a former prince, endued with this title before he came to the throne, as being the cho&s;en &s;ucce&s;&s;or to that prince. Of
<PB N="18" REF="48">this Tiberius, the fixed heir of Augu&s;tus, an$ Titus, the elde&s;t &s;on, and natural heir of Ve$|pa&s;ian, are in&s;tances.</P>
<P>From Tacitus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annal. l$b. I.</NOTE> we learn that Augu&s;tus ha$ the tribunician power, or reigned XXXVI years$ and from in&s;criptions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Apud Gruter. p. 295.

<P>This little di&s;qui&s;ition was nece&s;&s;ary, whe$ treating of the utility of the Roman coins to th$ chronology of hi&s;tory; but, leaving it, I &s;hall proceed to ob&s;erve, that a &s;eries of medals pre|&s;ents the very be&s;t &s;uite of documents, of th$ Roman hi&s;tory in particular, that the art o$ man could have invented. Checking the flat$|tery of &s;ome of them by the truth of hi&s;tory they in their turn reciprocally evidence th$ fal&s;ehood or veracity of the hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>Were I inclined to di&s;play erudition upon th$ &s;ubject of the various &s;ources of utility ari&s;ing$ from the &s;tudy of ancient medals, I &s;hould per|haps
<PB N="19" REF="49">run the ri&s;k of rivalling Spanheim, who has written two &s;tupendous folio volumes on this very theme. But as I much prefer a &s;ingle &s;park of Briti&s;h &s;en&s;e to all the German erudi|tion in the world, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with offering a very few remarks further upon this divi&s;ion of my work, and even tho&s;e after pre|mi&s;ing, that if any reader &s;hall be inclined to pronounce, that the principal utility of this &s;tudy is the elegant and &s;cientific amu&s;ement which it affords, I &s;hall not be di&s;po&s;ed to quarrel with him upon the &s;core of difference in our opinions.</P>
<P>However, be&s;ides its &s;ervice to hi&s;tory, the &s;cience of medals is certainly of con&s;iderable u&s;e to geography; to natural hi&s;tory; to the il|lu&s;tration of ancient writers; to architecture; and to the knowledge of a connoi&s;&s;eur, or that of ancient monuments, bu&s;ts, &s;tatues, ceremonies, and the like.</P>
<P>Its utility to geography may be traced from the many Greek coins in which the &s;ituation of towns is a&s;&s;igned, as near &s;ome noted river, mountain, &amp;c. Thus we have MAENHT&OHgr;N &Sgr;HI&Ugr;&Lgr;O&Ugr;, of the inhabitants of Magne&s;ia un|der mount Sipylus: E&PHgr;E&Sgr;I&OHgr;N, and the figure of a river, with KAI&Sgr;TPO&Sgr; in the exergue; which &s;hews that Ephe&s;us &s;tood upon the river Cay&s;ter. Innumerable &s;imilar in&s;tances may be
<PB N="20" REF="50">given upon this head, but the&s;e may &s;erve as a$ &s;pecimen.</P>
<P>The utility of the &s;tudy of ancient medals to natural hi&s;tory ari&s;es chiefly from the coins &s;truck on the celebration of the &s;aecular games in which the figures of various animals are pre|&s;erved. A celebrated naturali&s;t would not have a&s;&s;erted that the camelopard had never been &s;een in Europe till this century, had he chanced on the &s;aecular coin of Philippus, in which, if I mi&s;take not, it appears. Indeed had he read Horace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"$span$ camelo." Epi&s;t. ad Aug.</NOTE>, you will &s;ay, he might have cor|rected this blunder: and Politianus, in his Mi&s;|cellanea<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">$span$.</NOTE>, would have informed him of one &s;ent in a pre&s;ent from the Sultan of Egypt to Lorenzo de Medici. The&s;e &s;aecular medals very often indeed e&s;tabli&s;h the point whether any animal was known to the ancients or not. On many of the Greek medals are the lively repre&s;entations of many uncommon plants and animals; as in mo&s;t of the medals of Cyrene is the celebrated plant called <HI>&s;ylphium;</HI> and on tho&s;e of Tyre the &s;hell-fi&s;h from which the fa|mous Tyrian purple was procured.</P>
<P>The brevity of my de&s;ign obliges me to pa&s;s to the next divi&s;ion of utility, namely, that of the illu&s;tration of ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages in ancient writers to be drawn from coins. This article,
<PB N="21" REF="51">if treated at length, might be found almo&s;t in|finite; for &s;uch parts of authors of antiquity as have been explained, or may be explained, by the help of old coins, and are explainable by that help only, are innumerable. Upon &s;o va&s;t a theme, therefore, I chu&s;e rather to &s;ay no|thing than to &s;ay little.</P>
<P>The u&s;es to be drawn from this &s;tudy to the art of the architect are undoubtedly many; for on medals are pre&s;erved the exact delineations of many of the mo&s;t beautiful edifices of an|tiquity, now not exi&s;ting even in their ruins.</P>
<P>The knowlege of medals is no le&s;s u&s;eful, nay is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to the connoi&s;&s;eur, becau&s;e by it alone he is enabled to a&s;cribe ancient bu&s;ts and &s;tatues to their proper per|&s;ons; with innumerable other minute points of information, without which he cannot a&s;pire to that name, and which are only to be attained from an attention to this branch of &s;cience.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> Connection of the Study of Medals with the Fine Arts of Poetry, Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture.</HEAD>
<P>THE connection of this &s;cience with poetry has already been treated, at a con&s;iderable length, by one of the mo&s;t excellent writers England has produced. Mr. Addi&s;on, in his E&s;&s;ay on the U&s;efulne&s;s of ancient Medals, has compared them with pa&s;&s;ages of the Latin poets at &s;ome length. His title-page mentions that the Greek poets fall likewi&s;e into his plan; but this mu&s;t be a mi&s;take of the printer, or a yet &s;tranger mi&s;take of his own, for there is not the &s;lighte&s;t quotation from any Greek writer whatever from beginning to end. The prefer|ence
<PB N="23" REF="53">indeed which Mr. Addi&s;on &s;eems always inclined to give to the Latin poets, over tho&s;e of Greece<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Was Mr. Addi&s;on &s;killed in the Greek language$ $word$ he was, his &s;ad ta&s;te in neglecting the Greek w$$ters; if he was not, as I &s;u&s;pect, his ignorance, mu&s;t evince him but very $word$ qu$|li$ied for the office of a critic.</NOTE>, that is, to imitation over original genius, cannot be too &s;everely reprobated. The opinion of that ju&s;tly celebrated writer has a va&s;t influence upon public ta&s;te; and it is no wonder, for the Spectator, of which the princi|ples of critici&s;m are, in many in&s;tances, very &s;u&s;picious, is, neverthele&s;s, de&s;ervedly the mo&s;t popular book ever written.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not, however, attempt here to &s;upply that grand defect in Mr. Addi&s;on's performance, having the fear of Greek, and the ladies, before my eyes: not to mention that &s;uch an attempt would &s;well this &s;light e&s;&s;ay to a &s;ize much be|yond my intention. A few remarks, however, upon the general connection between the &s;tudy of medals and poetry I &s;hall beg leave to offer.</P>
<P>It may ju&s;tly be ob&s;erved, that the know|ledge of Greek medals is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;culptor, and perhaps an architect; while that of the Roman is the more intere&s;ting to a poet, and a painter. This is owing to the former containing chiefly the head of &s;ome king, &s;ome god, or godde&s;s, of exqui&s;ite relief and work|man&s;hip
<PB N="24" REF="54">on the obver&s;e; while the rever&s;e &s;el|dom, in the early Greek coins, affords much fancy of &s;ymbol, and, in the Imperial Greek coins, is chiefly impre&s;&s;ed with temples of their deities.</P>
<P>To a man of poetical imagination the Roman coins are mo&s;t entertaining, from the fine per&s;o|nifications and &s;ymbols to be found on their re|ver&s;es.&mdash;To in&s;tance in a few.</P>
<P>HOPE is repre&s;ented as a &s;prightly girl, walk|ing quickly, and looking &s;trait forwards. With her left hand &s;he holds up her garments, that they may not impede the rapidity of her pace; while, in her right hand, &s;he holds forth the bud of a flower, an emblem infinitely more fine than the trite one of an anchor. This per&s;onification, with &s;ome others, mu&s;t have been very familiar to the ancients, for often in this, and a few more in&s;tances, no name, as SPES AVG. or the like, is in&s;erted in the legend.</P>
<P>ABUNDANCE is imaged as a &s;edate matron, with a cornucopia in her hands, of which &s;he &s;catters the fruits over the ground, and does not hold up her cornucopia, and keep its contents to her&s;elf, as many modern poets and painters make her do.</P>
<P>The Emperor Titus, having cau&s;e to import a great &s;upply of corn, during a &s;carcity at Rome, that &s;upply, or the ANNONA, is finely re|pre&s;ented as a &s;edate lady, with a filled cornu|copia
<PB N="25" REF="55">in her left hand, which &s;he holds upright, to indicate that &s;he does not, however, mean to &s;catter it, as Abundance hath a title to do, but to give it to Equity to deal out. This la&s;t par|ticular is &s;hewn by her holding a little image of Equity, known by her &s;cales, and <HI>ha&s;ta pura,</HI> or pointle&s;s &s;pear, in her right hand, over a ba&s;ket filled with wheat. Behind the ANNONA is the prow of a &s;hip, decked with flowers, to imply that the corn was brought by &s;ea (from Africa), and that the &s;hips had had a pro&s;perous voyage. The be&s;t poet in the world could not have given us a finer train of imagery: the be&s;t painter would be puzzled to expre&s;s &s;o much matter in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s.</P>
<P>SECURITY &s;tands leaning on a pillar, indica|tive of her being free from all de&s;igns and pur|&s;uits; and <HI>teres atque rotundus,</HI> round and po|li&s;hed, as Horace phra&s;es i$, again&s;t all the rubs of chance.</P>
<P>The emblems of PIETY, MODESTY, and the like, are equally appo&s;ite and poetical.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of the &s;tate is pictured by a &s;hip, &s;ailing before a pro&s;perous breeze: an image than which the &s;uperlative genius of Gray could find none more exqui&s;ite; and he has accordingly u&s;ed it in his mo&s;t capital pro|duction, The Bard, with due &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The different countries of the then known world are al&s;o delineated with great poetical
<PB N="26" REF="56">imagery. It affords patriotic &s;atisfaction i$ particular to a Briton, to &s;ee his native i&s;land always repre&s;ented, upon the earlie&s;t imperial coins, &s;itting on a globe, with the &s;ymbol o$ military power, the <HI>labarum,</HI> in her hand, and the ocean rolling under her feet. An emblem almo&s;t prophetic of the va&s;t power which her dominion over the &s;ea will always give her, providing &s;he a&s;&s;erts her element of empire with due vigor and per&s;everance.</P>
<P>Speaking of the poetical imagery of ancient coins, it mu&s;t not be forgotten that there is one, and, to add to the wonder, a colonial one, and of rude execution, of Julius and Augu&s;tus, in&s;cribed IMP. &amp; DIVI F. which has a high claim to merit in this way. On the rever&s;e the conque&s;t of Egypt is repre&s;ented by the appo|&s;ite metaphor of a crocodile, an animal almo&s;t peculiar to that country, and at that period e&s;teemed altogether &s;o, which is chained to a palm-tree, at once a native of the country and &s;ymbolic of victory.</P>
<P>But, of the poetical invention di&s;played in very many of the ancient coins, the&s;e few in|&s;tances may &s;uffice, con&s;idering, as has been &s;aid, that Mr. Addi&s;on has written &s;o fully upon the &s;ubject of the connexion of this &s;tudy with that of Latin poetry; and to enter upon that in other languages falls not into the brief plan of this little performance.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="57">
<P>I think we are told that Rubens had a very fine collection of medals, and indeed, to a painter who dealed &s;o much in allegorical &s;ub|jects, they mu&s;t have been of the very fir&s;t im|portance; for no where are the attributes of per&s;onification &s;o finely pre&s;erved or delineated. A cabinet of medals may indeed be &s;aid to form the cla&s;&s;ic erudition of a painter.</P>
<P>It may be added, that, as the rever&s;es are &s;o u&s;eful for knowlege of per&s;onification, &s;ymbols of countries and actions, and the like, &s;o the portraits to be &s;een on old coins are no le&s;s im|portant to a painter; the high merit of a great number of them, in every character, ju&s;tly entitling them to be regarded as the be&s;t &s;tudies in the world. Not to mention that to a painter of the highe&s;t rank, an hi&s;toric painter, the &s;ci|ence of ancient medals is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that he may delineate his per&s;onages with the features they really bore when in exi&s;tence. This can only be attained in this way, or from &s;tatues and bu&s;ts, any one of which will co&s;t as much as hundreds of medals; and indeed a col|lection of &s;uch is only attainable by princes.</P>
<P>This naturally leads me to con&s;ider a little the advantages ari&s;ing from this &s;tudy to &s;culp|tors. Almo&s;t all the u&s;es which connect the &s;cience of medals with painting likewi&s;e render it &s;ub&s;ervient to the art of the &s;culptor but the latter will, from the &s;tudy of the Greek
<PB N="28" REF="58">coins in particular, derive no &s;mall profit. The heads of the &s;everal deities repre&s;ented on them, in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite alto-relievo, will recommend them to his attention in a particular manner.</P>
<P>The wonderful &s;kill of the Greeks in &s;culp|ture has always been a &s;ubject of admiration to the world. Nations, in which a ta&s;te for the fine arts has made any progre&s;s, have viewed, with univer&s;al applau&s;e, the wonderful efforts of Grecian genius; the character and expre&s;&s;ion of the faces, the contour, and perfect nature and &s;ymmetry of the whole figure; the &s;trength, cha&s;|ti&s;ed with inimitable <HI>morbidezza,</HI> that, if not life it&s;elf, is almo&s;t &s;uperior.</P>
<P>Yet, I know not how it is, that the Grecian coins, &s;i&s;ter productions of art, have never yet been regarded, &s;o far as I know, with proper attention by men of ta&s;te. I can only account for this by &s;uppo&s;ing that the &s;tudy of Greek medals has hitherto been looked upon as the province of the mere antiquary. But I will venture to &s;ay, that, to the man who admires medals &s;olely as pieces of workman&s;hip, tho&s;e of Greece will afford the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction. Con&s;idered in this view, and indeed in mo&s;t others, they excel tho&s;e of Rome, the be&s;t times of Rome, to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree. The perfect beauty and ten|derne&s;s of the female portraits, and the &s;trength and expre&s;&s;ion of the male, cannot be exceeded,
<PB N="29" REF="59">in any &s;hape, by the large&s;t efforts of Grecian &s;culpture.</P>
<P>In every quality of art the Roman coins yield to the Greek alone. If any aera were to be a&s;|&s;igned to the Roman, as more eminent for work|man&s;hip than another, that from Augu&s;tus to Adrian mu&s;t have the preference. In the days of Adrian, in particular, the Roman mint &s;eems to have been the very &s;eat of art and genius; witne&s;s the va&s;t number of exqui&s;ite per&s;onifica|tions, engraved with equal workman&s;hip, which &s;warm on the medals of that prince. Yet, from his time, down to the Po&s;thumi, coins of admi|rable execution are to be found. Tho&s;e of the Fau&s;tinas and Lucilla de&s;erve particular men|tion. There is one, and not an uncommon one, of the latter in great bra&s;s, which yields to no|thing of the kind. The rever&s;e is a Venus, with the name around her. The portrait of the obver&s;e &s;eems to &s;pring from the field of the coin. It looks, and breathes; nay, talks, if you tru&s;t your eyes.</P>
<Q><L>"Manca il parlar, di vivo altro non chledi:</L>

<P>The connection of the &s;tudy of ancient coins with architecture con&s;i&s;ts in the views of many of the mo&s;t excellent ancient edifices, which are found in perfect pre&s;ervation on medals, and there only. The&s;e furni&s;h much plea&s;ure and
<PB N="30" REF="60">in&s;truction to the architect, and &s;erve to form his ta&s;te to the ancient manner; that manner which unites perfect &s;implicity with &s;ublimity and grace; that manner which every age ad|mires in proportion as it has genius to imitate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IV.</HI> The various Sources of Delight and Amu&s;ement ari&s;ing from it.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal and mo&s;t legitimate &s;ource of plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the &s;cience of medals is their workman&s;hip. The motives of delight, which owe their origin to the other efforts of imitative art, will here likewi&s;e of cour&s;e predo|minate. A philo&s;ophic enquiry into the prime cau&s;es of our plea&s;ures ari&s;ing from art, tho it would make an admirable &s;ubject for a trea|ti&s;e, yet were in this place foreign and im|pertinent.</P>
<P>Not to enter then into that profound &s;ubject, this we know, that the mo&s;t barbarous nations are more plea&s;ed with the rude&s;t efforts of art than with the mo&s;t admirable works of nature;
<PB N="32" REF="62">and that, in proportion as the powers of the mind are large and various, &s;uch, likewi&s;e, ar$ the plea&s;ures which it receives from tho&s;e &s;u|perlative productions of art, which can only b$ the offspring of va&s;t genius. It follows, tha$ the creation of art alike plea&s;es the mo&s;t unin+formed, and the mo&s;t cultivated, mind.</P>
<P>In that creation the &s;kill of the engraver o$ medals certainly de&s;erves an honourable place$ The offspring of his labour, to the portablene&s;s and high fini&s;hing of miniature painting, adds$ the relief and expre&s;&s;ion of &s;culpture.</P>
<P>The chief and mo&s;t rational amu&s;ement, therefore, which &s;prings from this &s;tudy, origi|nates from the &s;trength and &s;pirit, from the fini&s;h and beauty, which the engraver has di&s;|played.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides this, there are many other &s;ources of entertainment in the &s;cience of medals. Such is the per&s;onal acquaintance which, &s;o to &s;peak, it gives us with all the great men of former times. Nothing can well be more amu&s;ing than to read hi&s;tory, with contemporary coins before you. It brings the actions, in a manner, before our eyes; and we &s;it, as in a theatre, with the actors before us.</P>
<P>Portraits have been always very intere&s;ting to mankind; and I doubt not but the love of them gave ri&s;e, not only to painting, but to &s;culpture.
<PB N="33" REF="63">No where are they to be found &s;o ancient, &s;o numerous, &s;o well pre&s;erved, as in medals. For a knowlege which, tho unimportant, is yet, to our trifling natures, mo&s;t intere&s;ting, namely, that of the form and features of tho&s;e who&s;e virtues and talents almo&s;t &s;urpa&s;&s;ed hu|manity, we are indebted to this &s;cience only. Lawgivers, monarchs, warriors, authors, all pa&s;s, as in a fairy review, before us.</P>
<Q><L>"The medal, faithful to its charge of fame,</L>
<L>"Through climes and ages bears each form and name;</L>
<L>"In one &s;hort view, &s;ubjected to our eye,</L>
<L>"Gods, Emperors, Heroes, Sages, Beauties lie."</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>We even mark, with delight, the &s;urly features of a Per&s;eus, or a Nero, and the lovely counte|nance of a Fau&s;tina, tho their vices di&s;graced human nature.</P>
<P>To this &s;atisfaction we may add that of be|holding, in lively portraiture, the various dre&s;&s;es, manners, and cu&s;toms, religious and civil cere|monies; in &s;hort, <HI>the very form and pre&s;&s;ure of the times</HI> of the ancients. Medals almo&s;t pre&s;ent an hi&s;tory of manners, an article but very lately cultivated, yet perhaps the mo&s;t u&s;eful and in|tere&s;ting of all the provinces of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>For the ineffable delight which the &s;heer an|tiquary takes in any ru&s;ty commodity, and de|faced medals in particular, we &s;hall not attempt
<PB N="34" REF="64">to account, but will leave it to any author who may, in future times, think of writing a much-wanted treati&s;e on the di&s;ea&s;es of the human mind. Certain it is, that men there are of this de&s;cription, who look upon coins as the more ancient, and of cour&s;e the more valuable, becau&s;e the portrait, rever&s;e, and legends, are almo&s;t totally obliterated, or at lea&s;t &s;o far as not to be recognizable by the mo&s;t plodding a&s;|&s;iduity, and forlorn conjecture. That exqui&s;ite device for a tattered banner,
<Q>"Quanto e piu lacera, tanto e piu bella,"</Q>
is their aphori&s;m on the &s;core of coins; where|as, to the man of ju&s;t ta&s;te, the perfect pre|&s;ervation of a medal forms one of its principal qualities.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="65">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> Metals u&s;ed in the fabrication of Coins and Medals.</HEAD>
<P>THESE metals are well known to be princi|pally three; Gold, Silver, and the various modifications of Copper.</P>
<P>It is looked upon as an undeniable axiom in this &s;cience, that the more ancient the gold em|ployed in coinage is, the greater is its purity. The &s;tandard of the utmo&s;t purity of gold $s well known to be twenty-four carats. From the&s;e twenty four carats almo&s;t every nation in modern Europe has deducted nearly two, which are made up of alloy; &s;o that the mo&s;t u&s;ual purity of coined gold amounts to about twenty-two carats. The old Engli&s;h &s;tandard now u&s;ed
<PB N="36" REF="66">is however twenty-three grains and a half fine and half a grain alloy.</P>
<P>Now the gold of the coinage of Philip o$ Macedon, Alexander the Great, Demetrius, and other princes, and cities, within a few centurie$ of their re&s;pective ages, is of &s;uperior pu|rity, and very little inferior to <HI>fine</HI> gold. In|deed, the only rea&s;on which appears, in the&s;e early times, to have occa&s;ioned the u&s;e of alloy at all, &s;eems to have been, that, without it en|tirely, the gold would have been totally unmal|leable and unworkable. For the fact is, tha$ little more alloy is allowed than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of fabrication.</P>
<P>The Roman gold coinage, down to Ve&s;pa&s;ian is very good, tho not &s;o pure, for there is only a forty-eighth part of the <HI>fine</HI> gold alloy$ After that prince, indeed, the alloy is doubled, &s;o that it ri&s;es to a twenty-fourth. Let us not ra&s;hly blame Titus, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the be&s;t of princes, the delight of mankind, for the invidious office of deba&s;ing the public money. To tho&s;e who have properly con&s;idered the &s;ubject, this de|ba&s;ement, far from appearing, as it would do in the&s;e times, an infamous effort of tyrannic power, will, on the contrary, &s;hine forth in its proper colours, as an act which adds glory even to a Titus.&mdash;Let us explain this in few words.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="67">
<P>The taxes of the Roman empire were always returned to the Imperial trea&s;ury in gold, wit|ne&s;s the common terms of civil law: <HI>Aurum Lu&s;trale; Aurum Vice&s;imarium; Aurum Corona|rium,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. On the contrary, the &s;tate expenditure was defrayed in &s;ilver. Hence, when, towards the decline of the empire, in|finite deba&s;ements were permitted in the other metals, yet none was allowed in gold, being that in which the Emperor's income was paid, and of which any abatement in value came, of cour&s;e, out of his own pocket. Thus the ad|ditional alloy permitted by Titus was, in fact, an important alleviation of the taxes of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the gold coins of his father and pre|dece&s;&s;or, Ve&s;pa&s;ian, have a purity quite &s;urpriz|ing, if the &s;tory told by Bodin be as true as it is improbable; for he tells us that the gold&s;miths of Paris, upon melting a Ve&s;pa&s;ian of gold, found only a 788th part alloy. I &s;uppo&s;e any of the&s;e gold&s;miths would have informed him that gold of that purity was never u&s;ed in any &s;hape.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver of the ancient Greek medals is of corre&s;pon&s;ive cha&s;tity, only admitting, as the gold, a very minute proportion of alloy; in like manner as the general run of modern coinage has likewi&s;e ob&s;erved the &s;ame pro|portion of alloy in the gold and the &s;ilver coin.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="68">
<P>But the Roman &s;ilver coinage, even in its greate&s;t antiquity and purity, by no means equals the Greek; for the deba&s;ement of the &s;ilver was as great an advantage to the &s;tate as that of the gold would have been a lo&s;s. However, it can never be called ba&s;e money till the reign of Didius Julianus, who, &s;quan|dering great wealth in his infamous purcha&s;e of the empire and &s;ub&s;equent donations to the praetorians, to induce them to maintain that purcha&s;e, found him&s;elf forced to have recour&s;e to a va&s;t degradation of the &s;ilver coinage. After this period, a pound of &s;uch &s;ilver is only worth a third part of the value of real &s;ilver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patin, introduct. a l$Hi&s;t. des Medailles.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Proceeding to the bra&s;s employed in mintage by the ancients; when pure, which is very un|common, it con&s;i&s;ts of two kinds; the red, or what the ancients called Cyprian bra&s;s, what we call copper; and the yellow.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is very uncommon in the large&s;t &s;ize of bra&s;s medals, or what are called large bra&s;s; but is common in the other &s;izes.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken of the&s;e three pure metals, let us proceed to mention the mixed. With us every coin of mixed metal is looked upon, without he&s;itation, as the produce of a forger's craft; but with the ancients it was otherwi&s;e; their coins in mixed metals being nearly as numerous as any others.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="69">
<P>Taking the&s;e mixtures according to their dignity, the fir&s;t which occurs is <HI>electrum,</HI> being a mixture of equal parts of gold and &s;ilver. The coins of the kings of the Cimmerian Bo&s;|phorus, during the imperial ages of Rome, are &s;truck in this metal, and are very &s;carce.</P>
<P>The next in value were Corinthian bra&s;s, had the ancients even &s;truck a &s;ingle medal in that metal, which, unfortunately for many a fond antiquary, they did not. That celebrated me|tal, during the very little time it was ever known at all, was certainly only employed in the fabrication of va&s;es and other ornamental toys. Indeed its aera of being in u&s;e was, as any rate, very &s;hort; for Pliny the elder tells us, that for a long time it had been utterly unknown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adeoque exolevit fundendi $e$is pretio&s;i ratio, $span$ di$ ne fortuna quidem in aere jus a$t$s habeat. Hi&s;t. Nat. XXXIV. $.</NOTE>. With rea&s;on, therefore, we may laugh at tho&s;e deluded authors, who pretend not only to find this metal in Imperial coins, but even to find three kinds of it; namely, 1. That in which gold predominates; 2. That in which &s;ilver is mo&s;t eminent; 3. That in which bra&s;s is the mo&s;t plenteous metal. I &s;u&s;pect Enea Vico, one of the earlie&s;t writers on me|dals, to have been the author of this &s;trange idea; which Savot, a writer of the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, had &s;en&s;e enough
<PB N="40" REF="70">to confute. The mi&s;take mu&s;t have ari&s;en from the circum&s;tance of the fir&s;t propagator of it not being able to account for the various mix|tures and modifications of bra&s;s, ob&s;ervable in ancient coins of the large &s;ize; and which, e&s;pecially in &s;o common a metal, appear &s;o odd to modern eyes. But, not to mention the authority of Pliny, above quoted, which is per|fect proof; or that of later antiquaries, who all declare that they have never &s;een one coin of Corinthian bra&s;s, or bra&s;s mingled with the &s;lighte&s;t proportion of gold or &s;ilver; there is another evidence of &s;uch &s;imple &s;tructure, and yet &s;uch va&s;t weight, that nothing can well mark the ab&s;ence of the antiquaries more than its omi&s;&s;ion, namely, that it is in the imperial <HI>a&s;es,</HI> worth about a penny, that this precious metal is di&s;covered, for I remember not to have heard of medallions in it. As the great &s;ize and weight of the&s;e <HI>a&s;es</HI> are well known, and they pa&s;&s;ed in common currency for about a penny only, it were truly &s;urpri&s;ing could the ancients have afforded any gold or &s;ilver in their fabric; nay, a predominance of either metal over the bra&s;s!</P>
<P>The fact is, that tho&s;e coins, which &s;ome an|tiquaries denominate of Corinthian bra&s;s, are only &s;truck on a mixture of the red and yellow bra&s;s mentioned above.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="71">
<P>To place the &s;ucceeding &s;orts of mixtures according to their actual value, were an attempt as &s;uperfluous as difficult. They &s;hall there|fore be detailed as they ri&s;e to memory.</P>
<P>Many of the Roman coins are of what the French call <HI>potin,</HI> which is de&s;cribed as a mix|ture of copper, lead, and tin, with a fifth part &s;ilver. The Abb&eacute; Rothelin, a noted collector of this century, had a complete &s;uite of this metal. The &s;uite mu&s;t of con&s;equence have been the work of the Egyptians, who u&s;ed that metal, or of Roman forgers, thro the &s;everal reigns, in imitation of the &s;ilver currency. As mu&s;t likewi&s;e that &s;ort called by the Italians <HI>metalline,</HI> which are common in the third and fourth ages of Roman emperors, and are only of copper tinged or wa&s;hed with &s;ilver. Many coins of what is called large bra&s;s are of tho&s;e mixtures now called pot metal and bell-metal. There are medals of Nero of a mo&s;t deba&s;ed and brittle bra&s;s. After the days of Gallienus coinage of bra&s;s with a very minute addition of &s;ilver, may, I &s;u&s;pect, be in many in&s;tances regarded as that authori&s;ed by the &s;tate. As may tho&s;e of copper or iron plated with &s;ilver, which always, however, con&s;ole the collector, for their diminution of intrin&s;ic value, by their indubitable antiquity.</P>
<P>Coins have been found in lead of undoubted antiquity: of the Greek tho&s;e of Tigranes in
<PB N="42" REF="72">particular. In Ro$$$ they mu&s;t have been prett$ ancient, for P$$$tus mentions them in one o$ two pa&s;&s;ages of his plays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">T$$$umm. Act. IV. Sc 4. et <HI>$word$.</HI></NOTE>; and a few impe|rial ones have been found. That &s;trange work the <HI>Notitia Imperii Romani,</HI> written in the days of Arcadius and Honorius, and worthy of that benighted period, mentions, if I remember right, coins of leather, among others, of which de$$eations are there given; and which are to|tally unlike any ancient coins yet found or ever to be found.</P>
<P>A few particulars relating to ancient coins which de&s;erve notice, and yet which do not &s;o properly fall under any of the other &s;ections of this work, nor are propo&s;ed to be treated at &s;uch length as to con&s;titute &s;ections of them|&s;elves, I &s;hall beg leave to &s;tate here.</P>
<P>The ROMAN MINT, as the mo&s;t important of the&s;e articles, de&s;erves to be fir&s;t mentioned. Of the Greek Mints we know little or nothing, but the excellence of the engravers employed, the mo&s;t important object indeed to the lover of medals. But the Roman Mint we know was ju&s;tly regarded as one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential ornaments and &s;inews of the &s;tate. It's impor|tance was va&s;t, from the va&s;tne&s;s of that empire thro which its produce was to circulate.</P>

<P>The <HI>Que&s;tor</HI> &s;eems at fir&s;t to have had the di|rection of the Mint, as well as the Trea&s;ury.

But under Aurelian it is probable there was but one ma&s;ter of the Roman mint, called the <HI>Rationalis</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vop$&s;cus, in Aureliano.</NOTE>: and I &s;u&s;|pect this change took place under Gallienus.

<PB N="45" REF="79">value, but to the man of antiquity, being gene|rally of rude invention, and always of rude execution.</P>
<P>The ancient manner of coining was very &s;im|ple, as we may judge from the coins them|&s;elves, and from the in&s;truments, as they are repre&s;ented on the rever&s;es of &s;ome ancient me|dals, particularly one with this legend T. CARI|SIVS. The engraving of the dye was indeed a work of much labour and genius; and, what is very &s;urpri&s;ing, hardly any two coins were &s;truck off without an alteration on the dye, of &s;ome minute kind or other. Hence very many antiquaries have been induced to that wild opi|nion, that there was never, in the good ages of the Roman empire, above one coin &s;truck from one dye. Indeed M. de la Ba&s;tie, a mo&s;t able judge of the&s;e matters, informs us, that the only two Roman imperial coins, of the fir&s;t ages, which he had &s;een, that were perfectly alike, were two of Galba; and many compe|tent judges of this &s;cience caution us, when we meet with two coins quite alike, to be upon our guard again&s;t the fal&s;ity of one of them. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the differences in coins apparently from the &s;ame dye, are often very minute, &s;o as &s;ometimes to e&s;cape an eye not u&s;ed to micro&s;copic ob&s;ervation of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s of the Roman coinage &s;eems to have been, 1. The melting the metal, and
<PB N="46" REF="80">making it of the proper alloy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exp$$&s;$ed in the mint-ma&s;ter's titles by <HI>Flando.</HI></NOTE>, then hammer|ing it to the proper thickne&s;s. 2. The cutting it into pieces of due weight; as, in cutting, the pieces, when round, often exceeded weight, we &s;eldom &s;ee medals quite circular, frag|ments being clipped off the &s;ides of them, to reduce them to the $word$ weight. 3. The impre&s;&s;ing the dye, which was done by repeated &s;trokes of the hammer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>$word$.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is looked upon as a certain rule in this &s;ci|ence, that none of the ancient money was ca&s;t in molds, except the Egyptian, and a few of the Greek colonial coins, with &s;ome of Po&s;t|humus, in great and middle bra&s;s. All other ca&s;t coins are forgeries of ancient or of modern times: for this was a manoeuvre of the ancient forgers, as we learn from &s;everal Roman molds<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A $span$ one may be &s;een in the <HI>Nummi P$mbrokiani.</HI></NOTE>which have been found, and which have led the un&s;kilful to imagine that the ancients fir&s;t ca&s;t their money, and then &s;tamped it, to make the impre&s;&s;ion more deep and &s;harp; an idea &s;o ut|terly ab&s;urd as to need no confutation.</P>
<P>The ancients, though &s;trangers to the art of impre&s;&s;ing legends upon the edges of their money, like the DECUS ET TUTAMEN upon our crown pieces, and to the fine indentation ob&s;erv|able on our gold, yet knew &s;omething of cre|nating
<PB N="47" REF="81">the edges of their coin. This they did by cutting out regular notches on the edges, in the &s;hape of &s;mall parts of a circle. Some of the Syrian coins, and of the Roman con&s;ular, with a few other early ones, are ornamented in this manner.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to add to this &s;ection &s;ome hints as to the number of ancient coins, with quite different rever&s;es, which we have. The Abb&eacute; Rothelin had in his cabinet no le&s;s than 1800 coins of Probus, who&s;e reign was but of &s;even years. The number of Roman gold imperial coins may amount to 3000; the &s;ilver to 6000; and the bra&s;s to 30,000. The whole of the different ancient coins, known to us, to about 50,000.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VI.</HI> Different Sizes of ancient Coins.</HEAD>
<P>THE Greek coins, in gold and &s;ilver, are di|vided into the &s;everal denominations of the <HI>Drachm,</HI> which is nearly equal in value to the Roman <HI>denarius,</HI> and commonly a little large$ than our &s;ixpence; the <HI>Didrachm,</HI> or double the former; the <HI>Tridrachm,</HI> or it's triple; and the <HI>Tetradrachm,</HI> equal in value, as the name im|ports, to four <HI>drachms.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e Greek pieces, tho of fixed weight, are of very uncertain &s;izes; the Tetradrachm, for in&s;tance, being &s;ometimes expanded to the &s;ize of our crown-piece, and often no larger than our &s;hilling, tho what it wants in extent
<PB N="49" REF="83">it compen&s;ates in thickne&s;s, &s;o as to pre&s;erve nearly the &s;ame weight. Hence medalli&s;ts have been forced, in arranging the Greek medals, to do it by their weight, while they place the Ro|man according to &s;ize.</P>
<P>Indeed, the ancient Greek gold and &s;ilver coinage was always allotted by the weight of different parts of their ounce, the drachm being in Greece, as at this day, the term of a weight equal to the eighth part of an ounce, and that, I &s;uppo&s;e, before the invention of money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homer mentions &s;cales, but knew nothing of money.</NOTE>: for it is natural to imagine that, upon the invention of coinage, the fir&s;t rude attempts bore no &s;ort of impre&s;&s;ion whatever<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They who wi&s;h to &s;ee this &s;ubject enveloped in the darkne&s;s of German erudition may con&s;ult the book of Sperlingius, <HI>De Nummis non Cu&s;is.</HI></NOTE>, but were &s;olely valued by their weight. As different States, however, found it convenient to pur&s;ue different modes of coinage, &s;ome rude mark, as a badge of di&s;tinc|tion, was at fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ed upon one &s;ide of the coin. This is very evident in the progre&s;s of the Grecian coinage in particular. It is true, that, to this day, no pieces have been found to|tally unimpre&s;&s;ed, or, if they have, no notice has been taken of them; but we have coins which, from their form and feature, are allowed to be the olde&s;t in the world, and which are &s;truck upon one &s;ide with the uncouth figure of a tor|toi&s;e,
<PB N="50" REF="84">while the other has only indented mark$ occa&s;ioned by its being fixed upon &s;ome in&s;tru|ment in order to receive the impre&s;&s;ion. Coi$ of the &s;ame marks in every re&s;pect, and evi|dently of the &s;ame State, but in a more ad|vanced mintage, have All$l upon them.

They &s;hould read the ancient writers Pau$anias, Strabo, and Stephanus of Byzantium, in particula$ with attention.</NOTE>, a city of wealth and extent? But, fo$ my own part, I have little doubt that the&s;e coins belong to Aegina, an i&s;land remarkabl$ for its coinage in the earlie&s;t times, in&s;omuc$ that ancient writers inform us, that it was com|mon for merchants to bargain to be paid fo$ commodities in <HI>drachms</HI> of Aegina.</P>
<P>To return. As weight was doubtle&s;s th$ fir&s;t e&s;timate of coin, &s;o, in the Grecian in par|ticular, it continued always the &s;tandard: th$ it is &s;urprizing that this ingenious people di$ not perceive that by fixing the &s;ize, as well as the weight of money, much unnece&s;&s;ary trou|ble might have been &s;aved in commerce. In|deed,
<PB N="51" REF="85">the weight it&s;elf varied in different &s;tates, and in the &s;ame &s;tate at different periods: but to detail erudition upon this point were as ab|&s;urd as unnece&s;&s;ary; it is &s;ufficient to have laid down the general rules for di&s;tingui&s;hing the different Greek coins. It may not however be improper to add, that &s;mall Grecian &s;ilver coins are likewi&s;e found of the value of the half and quarter, nay the eighth and &s;ixteenth, of a drachm; and that the Greek <HI>&s;tateres,</HI> often mentioned in their writers, were &s;ometimes di|drachms, and &s;ometimes tetradrachms, of gold.</P>
<P>The Grecian bra&s;s coins are, the Lepton, which is the &s;malle&s;t, the Chalcos, the Dichal|cos, Hemiobolium, and Obolus, which is larger than the Roman large bra&s;s; and when it occurs, or the Double Obolus, they are com|monly called <HI>weights</HI> by antiquaries, who, under that name, often di&s;gui&s;e their ignorance of the &s;ize of &s;ome ancient coins.</P>
<P>The &s;izes of the Roman coins are much more fixed and appropriated. In gold we have the golden denarius, by the ancients termed &s;imply <HI>aureus,</HI> which is always much of a &s;ize with the denarius. In &s;ilver likewi&s;e the large&s;t we have is the <HI>denarius.</HI> Any Roman coins in gold or &s;ilver of &s;uperior &s;ize are medallions. Le&s;&s;er &s;ilver coins, however, are the <HI>quinarius,</HI> or half the denarius, and the <HI>&s;e&s;tertius,</HI> or its fourth. There are likewi&s;e a few <HI>quinarii</HI> of gold.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="86">
<P>The Roman copper coinage, it is well known, falls chiefly into three &s;izes; the <HI>as,</HI> or large bra&s;s; the <HI>&s;emis,</HI> or middle bra&s;s; and the <HI>quadrans,</HI> or &s;mall bra&s;s. We have no coins between the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;izes, which are equal to tho&s;e of our crown and half crown; but after the &s;econd &s;ize there is great variety, being the <HI>quincunx, triens, quadrans,</HI> and <HI>&s;ex|tans,</HI> of the ancients; all which however me|dalli&s;ts denominate, without di&s;tinction, coins in &s;mall bra&s;s.</P>
<P>After the time of Gallienus the large bra&s;s is very uncommon, except in the medals of Po&s;tumus; but after Po&s;tumus the large bra&s;s is deemed a medallion, and the middle bra&s;s is regarded as of a rank with the large of the earlier emperors.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VII.</HI> Their former Value.</HEAD>
<P>IN e&s;timating the former value of ancient coins a curious di&s;tinction occurs between them and the modern. In the proportion of the copper to the &s;ilver, both are much alike; but in that of the &s;ilver to the gold there is a very wide difference. Our guinea, equal in &s;ize to our &s;hilling, contains twenty one &s;hillings; whereas the Greek gold drachm, and Roman <HI>aureus,</HI> equal in &s;ize to the &s;ilver drachm, and denarius, were only valued at ten drachms, or denarii, of &s;ilver. The modern di&s;coveries of America, and other countries opulent in mines, can have no effect upon this change in the pro|portional value of gold and &s;ilver, as much being found of the former as of the latter
<PB N="54" REF="90">The cau&s;es why gold encrea&s;es in its value and preeminence over other metals, almo&s;t every century, I mu&s;t confe&s;s to be latent to me, and I have in vain tried to inve&s;tigate them.</P>
<P>It is in the copper and &s;ilver coinage of the ancients that we mu&s;t find our &s;tandard of the relative value of their money to ours. The gold is out of all proportion, owing to the na|tions of antiquity valuing that metal at only one half the price which we put upon it. So that if we are told in an ancient writer that a hou&s;e, for example, was bought for 4000 drach$s of gold, in&s;tead of appretiating the hou&s;e at 80,000 drachms of &s;ilver, the modern proportion, we &s;hould mark it's value at 40,000, the ancient relation of gold to &s;ilver; that is, in&s;tead of 2666<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 13<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> we &s;hould put 1333<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>; if we would have the real purcha&s;e in Engli&s;h money.</P>
<P>It is by no means intended here to lay before the reader any account of the ideal money of the ancients. All that is propo&s;ed is to inform him of the relative value of the real ancient coins which commonly occur, and are mention|ed in the preceding &s;ection. This &s;hall be done in the order they are there enumerated.</P>
<P>The Greek &s;ilver drachm is worth eight pence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some drachms occur worth 7 &frac12;<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>; others of 8 &frac12;<ABBR><HI>d;</HI></ABBR> the mean is cho&s;en.</NOTE> of our money: the gold drachm, being

The lepton is nearly half a farthing; the chalcos nearly a farthing; the dichalcos rather more than a farthing; the hemiobolus rather more than a halfpenny.</P>
<P>In the Roman coinage the <HI>aureus</HI> was, $$t one time, worth, as the Grecian gold drachm, only ten of the &s;ilver denarii. Pliny however in|forms us, that it was afterwards rai&s;ed to the value of &s;ixteen &s;ilver denarii, at which rate it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood ever after; &s;o that we mu&s;t put t$$ <HI>$$ureus</HI> at 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> ancient va|luation, 21<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> modern.</P>

<P>The different divi&s;ions of the <HI>as</HI> may, if it is worth while, be ea&s;ily e&s;timated from the value of the whole.

<P>Nothing contributes &s;o much to the con&s;er|vation of coins as that fine ru&s;t, or rather var|ni&s;h, which their lying in a particular &s;oil oc|ca&s;ions. This is only to be found however in the bra&s;s or copper, the gold and &s;ilver never admitting of it: there is indeed a red ru&s;t which is &s;ometimes found on the latter, but it is pre|judicial, and not ornamental; and corrodes the coin, in&s;tead of pre&s;erving it.</P>
<P>This fine ru&s;t, which is indeed a natural varni&s;h not imitable by any effort of human art, is &s;ometimes of a delicate blue, like that of a turquoi&s;e; &s;ometimes of a bronze brown, equal to that ob&s;ervable in ancient &s;tatues of bronze, and &s;o highly prized; and &s;ometimes of an exqui&s;ite green, a little on the azure hue, which la&s;t is the mo&s;t beautiful of all. In a few in&s;tances a ru&s;t of deeper green is found; and it is &s;ometimes &s;potted with the red or bronze &s;hade, which gives it quite the appear|ance of the Ea&s;t Indian &s;tone called blood-&s;tone. The&s;e ru&s;ts are all, when the real product of time, as hard as the metal it&s;elf, and pre|&s;erve it much better than any artificial varni&s;h could have done; concealing at the &s;ame time
<PB N="60" REF="100">not the mo&s;t minute particle of the impre&s;&s;io$ of the coin.</P>
<P>When medals are found in which the letter are di&s;placed, as is common in tho&s;e of Clau|dius Gothicus, their condition is looked upon as dubious, and they are not near &s;o much e&s;teemed as coins without fault. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of tho&s;e which, not being well fixed in the dye, have &s;lipped at every &s;troke of the hammer, and by this means pre&s;ent a double o$ triple image. Many of the&s;e la&s;t are found in which the portrait is thus blundered, while the rever&s;e is di&s;tinct; and others, of which the portrait is perfectly well &s;truck, while the re|ver&s;e confu&s;es the eye by it's double or triple contours. This mu&s;t have been owing to that particular half of the dye being mi&s;managed in which the fault is found.</P>
<P>There is another blemi&s;h of ancient coins, which, notwith&s;tanding, rather recommends them to the curious than otherwi&s;e. It is when, after having &s;truck a coin, the workmen thro forgetfulne&s;s put another into the dye without retiring the fir&s;t. Hence, the portrait of the other piece being commonly upwards, and in the upper part of the dye, the &s;econd coin is impre&s;&s;ed with it by the dye, and at the &s;ame time made hollow on the other &s;ide with the form of the portrait already &s;tamped on the former medal.</P>

<P>Coins of genuine antiquity are often found &s;plit on the edges, or even in the middle, by the force of the hammer.

<P>Then follow tho&s;e kings and queens who reigned in Sicily, Caria, Cyprus, Heraclia, and Pontus. To the&s;e &s;ucceeds the &s;eries of kings of Aegypt, Syria, the Cimmerian Bo&s;phorus,

This &s;eries extends from the time of Alexander the Great to the birth of Chri&s;t, a period of about 330 years. The la&s;t &s;eries of ancient kings goes down to the fourth century, and includes &s;ome of Thrace, the Bo&s;|phorus, and Parthia; tho&s;e of Commagene, Ede&s;&s;a or O&s;rhoene, Mauretania, and Judaea.</P>
<P>Such are the &s;erie&s;es of the portraits of kings to be found on medals &s;truck with Grecian characters. Of Greek coins, impre&s;&s;ed with the heads of illu&s;trious men, a good number may be found, but ought more properly to be called a collection than a &s;eries, the latter term always implying a chronological &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Roman emperors pre&s;ent a mo&s;t di&s;tinct &s;eries, from Julius, the fir&s;t of them, to the de&s;truction of Rome by the Goths: nay, to a much later period, were not the coins after this &s;o barbarous as to de&s;troy the beauty of the &s;eries while they add to its perfection.</P>

<P>The&s;e rever&s;es, in the ancient Greek and Roman coins, are of infinite variety, and afford one of the chief amu&s;ements ari&s;ing from this &s;tudy. They contain figures of deities, at whole length, with their attributes and &s;ym|$ols; public buildings, and diver&s;ions; allego|rical repre&s;entations; ceremonies, civil and re|ligious; hi&s;torical and private events; figures of ancient &s;tatues; plants, animals, and other &s;ubjects of natural hi&s;tory; ancient magi&s;tracies,
<PB N="66" REF="106">with their in&s;ignia; in &s;hort, almo&s;t every objec$ of nature or art.</P>
<P>Some rever&s;es bear the portrait of the queen$ the &s;on, or the daughter, of the prince wh$ appears on the obver&s;e. Such are e&s;teemed highly by antiquaries, not only becau&s;e it is a rule with them that every coin &s;tamped with portraits on either &s;ide is very valuable, but becau&s;e they identify the per&s;onage on the re|ver&s;e to have been the wife, the &s;on, or the daughter, of &s;uch a particular prince, and by this means help in the adju&s;ting of a &s;eries.</P>
<P>The rever&s;es of the Roman coins have more of art and de&s;ign than the Greek; but, in re|turn, the Greek have more exqui&s;ite relief and workman&s;hip than the other.</P>
<P>In the very ancient coins, as in tho&s;e of the fir&s;t kings of Macedon, no rever&s;e is found, &s;ave a rude mark &s;truck into the metal, as of a &s;quare with a cro&s;s in it, or the like. This was owing to the medal being merely fixed firm to &s;ome in&s;trument on that &s;ide, that it might receive the impre&s;&s;ion upon the other. By degrees however we &s;ee &s;ome little image of a hor&s;e, or other animal, in&s;erted into one of the departments of the rude cro&s;s, or into the body of the &s;quare. Then follows a perfect rever&s;e of an hor&s;e, or the like, with a &s;light mark, and at length without any mark of the &s;quare or
<PB N="67" REF="107">cro&s;s. Such is the progre&s;s of the rever&s;es of coins from rudene&s;s to de&s;ign, which was &s;oon after carried to refinement.</P>
<P>The figures of deities and per&s;onifications, on the Roman coins, are commonly attended with their names, be&s;ides being di&s;tingui&s;hed by their attributes. The&s;e names, when without any adjunct, as they &s;ometimes &s;tand, may be &s;afely looked upon as put down merely becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary the coin &s;hould have a legend. Thus, in a coin of Lucilla, Venus, tho well known by the apple which &s;he always holds in her hand, has yet the name round her, VENVS, without any addition whatever. The like may be ob|&s;erved in a few other in&s;tances. But mo&s;t com|monly an adjunct is added, which renders the in&s;ertion of the name very proper and nece&s;|&s;ary, as in the in&s;tance of a Neptune, with NEPTVNO REDVCI; a Venus, with VENERI VICTRICI; and others &s;imilar. The like may be &s;aid of the coins with a figure of Mode&s;ty, PVDICITIAE AVGVSTAE; of Virtue, VIRTVS AV|GVSTI; and others of the &s;ame kind: for it is the legend which appropriates the virtue to the emperor or empre&s;s, and thus leaves no doubt as to the meaning of the rever&s;e. A quality not &s;o often ob&s;erved on modern medals, which are frequently dark as a riddle; and it &s;eems to be the intention of the de&s;igner to make the
<PB N="68" REF="108">legend and rever&s;e fight a combat together and ob&s;cure, not illu&s;trate, each other's meaning</P>
<P>In the Greek coins, however, perhaps it is a &s;uperior delicacy that the name of the deity i$ never expre&s;&s;ed, but left to the ea&s;y interpre|tation of fixed &s;ymbols. This remarkable dif|ference is ob&s;ervable in the earlie&s;t coins of the two countries, and on which only the bu&s;t o$ the deity or per&s;onification is given. The Ro|man have almo&s;t always the name, as PIE|TAS, LIBERTAS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> while the Greeks conten$ them&s;elves with giving us Ceres with he$ wheaten garland; Jupiter with his mild coun|tenance, laurel crown, and beard; Minerva with her helmet, and &s;o forth.

<PB N="71" REF="111">Jupiter Ammon is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the ram's horn twi&s;ting round his ear: a &s;ymbol of power and &s;trength afterwards whim&s;ically ad|opted by many kings of Syria, to mark their regarding them&s;elves as the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alex|ander the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;on of Ammon.</P>
<P N="2">II. NEPTUNE &s;eldom occurs on the coins of Greece. When he appears he is well known by the trident, or the dolphin; and is &s;ome|times drawn by &s;ea-hor&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">III. APOLLO is frequent on the rever&s;es of the Syrian princes; and is known by the harp, the branch of laurel, or the tripod; &s;ome|times he has a bow and arrows. When the bu&s;t only occurs, he has a fair young face, and is crowned with laurel; and, in the character of the &s;un, his head is &s;urrounded with rays.</P>
<P N="4">IV. MARS, &s;eldom &s;een on Greek medals, is di&s;tingui&s;hable by his armour, and &s;ometimes by a trophy on his &s;houlders. The bu&s;t is known by the helmet and ferocious counte|nance.</P>
<P N="5">V. MERCURY appears with the <HI>caduceus,</HI> or wand twined with &s;erpents, and the <HI>mar&s;upium,</HI> or pur&s;e, which he holds in his hand. He is delineated as a youth with a &s;mall cap on his head, and wings behind his ears and at his feet. The bu&s;t is known by the cap, which re&s;em|bles a &s;mall hat, and the wings.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="112">
<P N="6">VI. AESCULAPIUS is remarkable by his bu&s;h$ beard, and his leaning on a club with a &s;erpen$ twi&s;ted round it. He &s;ometimes occurs with his wife Hygeia, or Health, and their little &s;o$ Tele&s;phorus, or Convale&s;cence, between them.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The attributes of BACCHUS are, the ti|ger, the &s;atyrs around him, the <HI>thyr&s;us</HI> or ro$ twi&s;ted with ivy or vine, and the crown com+po&s;ed of one of the&s;e plants. His bu&s;t is di&s;|tingui&s;hable by the latter &s;ymbol.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The club, lion's &s;kin, and &s;inewy &s;trength, reveal HERCULES: &s;ometimes a cup is added, to imply that wine in&s;pires courage; and the poplar tree, &s;ymbolic of vigor. He often appears as breaking the neck of the Ne|maean lion by cru&s;hing it &s;toutly in his arms. His bu&s;t is common on coins of Alexander the Great, and other princes; as al&s;o on tho&s;e of &s;ome Sicilian cities, as Me&s;&s;ina, and others: it is that of a youth without a beard, with the lion's &s;kin wrapt around it; and on the coins of Alexander has been fal&s;ely taken for the por|trait of that prince. He likewi&s;e is &s;ometimes drawn with a beard, in which ca&s;e he is called the Old Hercules; as, when he appears beard|le&s;s, he is denominated the Young Hercules.</P>
<P N="9">IX. SERAPIS, one of the fanta&s;tic gods of Egypt, is known by his bu&s;hy beard, and the mea&s;ure upon his head. APIS appears as a bull with a flower of the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the <HI>celtis,</HI> or <HI>lotus,
<PB N="73" REF="113">fructu nigricante,</HI> of botani&s;ts, between his horns. This tree, by us called the nettle-tree, from the form of its leaf, &s;eems to have been a great fa|vourite of the ancients, and placed in the &s;ame rank with the laurel and the myrtle, the fa|vourites of Apollo and Venus. Its flower is in the form of a ro&s;e, of five leaves, and with many &s;tamina in the bo&s;om; and its fragrance induced the ancients to &s;prinkle it over their couches, along with the blooms of the myrtle.</P>

<BIBL>ANACREON.</BIBL></Q>
<P N="10">X. HARPOCRATES, the god of &s;ilence, is evident from the familiar token of putting his finger to his mouth. Sometimes he has the &s;i&s;trum in his left hand, which is a &s;ymbol common to mo&s;t of the Egyptian deities.</P>
<P N="11">XI. CANOPUS is very common on the coins of Egypt, in the &s;ingular &s;hape of a human head, placed upon a kind of pitcher. This deified pitcher &s;eems to refer to an anecdote of ancient &s;uper&s;tition, which, I believe, is recorded by Plutarch. It &s;eems, &s;ome Per&s;ian and Egyptian prie&s;ts had a conte&s;t which of their deities had the &s;uperiority. The Egyptian &s;aid that a &s;in|gle va&s;e, &s;acred to Serapis, would extingui&s;h the whole power of the Per&s;ian deity of fire.
<PB N="74" REF="114">The experiment was tried, and the wily Egyp|tian boring holes in the &s;ide of the va&s;e, an$ &s;topping them with wax, afterwards filled th$ ve&s;&s;el with water, which, gu&s;hing through th$ holes, as the wax melted, extingui&s;hed th$ Per&s;ian deity. Hence the va&s;e was deified, and certainly de&s;erved it better than the onions and leeks of that learned and fooli&s;h nation, &s;o wel$ ridiculed by Juvenal:
<Q><L>"O &s;anctas gentes quibus na&s;cuntur in hortis</L>
<L>"Numina!"</L></Q></P>
<P N="12">XII. This li&s;t of &s;ymbolized gods &s;hall be clo&s;ed with the IEPA &Sgr;&Ugr;NK&Lgr;HTO&Sgr;, and IEPO&Sgr; &Dgr;HMO&Sgr;, the HOLY SENATE, and the HOLY PEOPLE, &s;o frequent on Greek Imperial coins. The&s;e ideal per&s;ons are commonly &s;een in the &s;ame image of an ancient bearded head, crowned with laurel; &s;ometimes, however, the latter appears as a youth.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing to the female deities, or godde&s;&s;es, the fir&s;t in dignity is,</P>
<P N="1">I. JUNO, known by the peacock, a bird &s;a|cred to her from the fable of Argus. When &s;he appears as the godde&s;s of marriage, &s;he is veiled to the middle, and &s;ometimes to the toes. Her bu&s;t is that of a beautiful young woman, &s;ometimes without any badge, which is di&s;tinc|tion &s;ufficient, as the re&s;t of the godde&s;&s;es have badges; and &s;ometimes with a diadem.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="115">
<P N="2">II. The &s;ymbols of MINERVA are very re|markable, con&s;i&s;ting of her being in armour, with a &s;pear in her right hand, and the aegis, or &s;hield, with Medu&s;a's head, in the other; an owl commonly &s;tanding be&s;ide her. Her bu&s;t is equally di&s;tingui&s;hable from the helmet which &s;he always wears: it is very common on the gold coin of Alexander the Great; and one cannot help laughing at the odd blunder of Elzevir, or his editor, who, in the be&s;t edition of Quintus Curtius, gave an head of this god|de&s;s for that of Alexander.</P>
<P N="3">III. DIANA is revealed by the cre&s;cent, by her bow and arrows, and often by her hounds. The Ephe&s;ian Diana, common upon Greek Im|perial coins, appears with a number of <HI>mammae;</HI> &s;he is &s;upported by a couple of deer, and bears a panier of fruit on her head. The bu&s;t of Diana is known by the cre&s;cent on her brow, and &s;ometimes by the bow, or quiver, engraved on one &s;ide.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The apple in her hand, the prize of beauty, declares VENUS. Sometimes &s;he is only to be known by her total want of dre&s;s, without any other &s;ymbol. Her bu&s;t is di&s;tingui&s;hable by her &s;upreme beauty, and is often adorned with pearls around the neck. It might have been mentioned above, that CUPID &s;ometimes appears on the Syrian coins, in half-length, as
<PB N="76" REF="116">painters call it, and is known by his infanc$ and wings.</P>
<P N="5">V. CYBELE has the turreted crown, and lion$ or is &s;een in a chariot drawn by lions. Her bu$ is known by the fir&s;t-mentioned attribute.</P>
<P N="6">VI. CERES has the torches in her hands with which &s;he is fabled to have gone in &s;earch of her daughter Pro&s;erpine. She has &s;ometimes two &s;erpents by her, and is &s;ometimes drawn in a chariot by them. Her bu&s;t is readily known by the wheaten garland; and is mo&s;t common on coins of Sicily, an i&s;land celebrated for it's fertility.</P>
<P N="7">VII. ISIS, an Egyptian godde&s;s, has the &s;i&s;|trum in her hand, and a bud, or flower, on her head, &s;ymbolic of the eternal bloom of the in|habitants of heaven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch de I&s;ide.</NOTE>. The flower is &s;aid to be that of the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or &s;outhernwood, which is not very likely: it would rather &s;eem to be that of a &s;pecies of amaranth.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. ASTARTE, a Sidonian godde&s;s, appears on a globe, &s;upported by a chariot of two wheels, and drawn by two hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Such are the more eminent &s;ymbols and attributes of the deities; there only remain to be mentioned a few &s;ymbols, which &s;tand by them&s;elves, as figurative of per&s;ons or cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="117">
<P>Such are va&s;es, with &s;prigs of plants i&s;&s;uing out of them, &s;ymbolic of &s;olemn games. The &s;mall che&s;t, or hamper, with a &s;erpent leaping out of it, &s;hews the my&s;tic rites of Bacchus. Coins with the latter image are called <HI>ci&s;tophori;</HI> and a learned treati&s;e has been publi&s;hed con|cerning them.</P>
<P>The anchor on Seleucian medals marks the coin to be &s;truck at Antioch, where an anchor was found upon digging the fir&s;t foundations of the city, tho at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>A &s;mall &s;eat, like a bu&s;hel pierced with many holes, upon which Apollo &s;its, in dif|ferent coins of the princes of Syria, is that upon which the prie&s;t of Apollo at Daphne, near Antioch, u&s;ed to &s;it to return oracles. It was placed over an aperture of the floor of the temple, through which the gale of in&s;piration was thought to ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t remarkable &s;ym|bols ob&s;erved on the Greek coins, let us exa|mine a very few of the Roman, which &s;tand alone, and require explanation; for the deities and per&s;onifications on the Roman coins, as has been &s;aid, have not only attributes, but their names likewi&s;e in the legend of the medal, which renders it quite unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell upon them.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="118">
<P>An en&s;ign on a Roman rever&s;e, where &s;tands alone, and without any per&s;ons, &s;hews colony drawn from one legion; when many e$+&s;igns or banners appear in the like circum|&s;tances, they evince the colony to have been drawn from as many legions as there are en&s;igns$</P>
<P>A bull often repre&s;ents Apis, and is often &s;ymbol of &s;trength and &s;ecurity. Which of the&s;e is meant in the common coin of Julian, i$ middle bra&s;s, e&s;teemed large bra&s;s in that age$ when no larger was coined, upon the rever&s;e o$ which is a bull, with two &s;tars over him, and the legend SECVRITAS REIPVB. I will not &s;ay.</P>
<P>The caduceus marks peace and concord; the cornucopia, abundance; the pontifical hat, the prie&s;thood. They all appear upon a rever&s;e o$ Julius, and are &s;ymbols of the concord of the empire, and the plenty which attended his power. The la&s;t &s;ymbol only denotes that Cae&s;ar was Pontifex Maximus, not his attention to religion, as Pere Jobert religiou&s;ly ex|plains it.</P>
<P>The <HI>parazonium,</HI> ob&s;ervable on Roman coins, was a baton of command, and not a pointle&s;s dagger, as many antiquaries de&s;cribe it to have been. This is evident from a rever&s;e of Galba, HONOS ET VIRTUS, and other circum&s;tances: it is always held as a baton, not placed by the &s;ide, or held by the handle, as a dagger. Why no Roman emperor or &s;oldier appears on their coins with a &s;word by his &s;ide can never be ex|plained
<PB N="79" REF="119">by antiquaries; much le&s;s why that weapon is never &s;een on their coins.</P>
<P>The in&s;truments of &s;acrifice appear on many Roman coins, and are, 1. The <HI>&s;ece&s;pita,</HI> or an oblong hatchet, or large knife, to kill the vic|tim. 2. <HI>A&s;per&s;orium,</HI> or ve&s;&s;el for holy water, with which the prie&s;t &s;prinkled the a&s;&s;i&s;tants. 3. <HI>Simpullum,</HI> or the ve&s;&s;el for pouring wine on the &s;acrifice. 4. <HI>Patina,</HI> or <HI>patera,</HI> a di&s;h for the fat, and other portions &s;acred to the gods. 5. <HI>Acerra,</HI> a little coffer of incen&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>lituus,</HI> or wand twi&s;ted round at the top, &s;omething like an epi&s;copal &s;taff, is a badge of the augur&s;hip; as the <HI>apex,</HI> or cap with &s;trings, and terminating with a tuft, is of the pontificate.</P>
<P>The <HI>then&s;a,</HI> or divine chariot, which carried the image of a deity in &s;acred proce&s;&s;ions (im|properly termed <HI>carpentum</HI> by &s;ome), is a badge of con&s;ecration of an empre&s;s; as is the peacock, which was the bird of Juno, the queen of Heaven. The&s;e &s;ometimes appear without the legend <HI>Con&s;ecratio,</HI> as the <HI>then&s;a</HI> on a coin &s;truck under Tiberius for the con&s;ecra|tion of Livia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well known that Livia took the name of Julia after her high marriage.</NOTE>, the wife of Augu&s;tus, S.

<P>The palm-tree, on both Greek and Roman coins, is &s;ymbolic of Phoenicia, where that tree flouri&s;hed: as the <HI>&s;ilphium</HI> is of Cyrene, from the earlie&s;t times down to tho&s;e of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>Before this &s;ection is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, a few words mu&s;t be &s;aid re&s;pecting the &s;ymbols ob&s;ervable on the obver&s;es of ancient medals, con&s;i&s;ting of the diadem, and other ornaments of the bu&s;ts of eminent per&s;ons, to be found on them.</P>
<P>The diadem, or <HI>vitta,</HI> was a ribbon worn around the head, and tied in a floating knot be|hind, anciently the &s;imple, but &s;uperlative, badge of kingly power. It is ob&s;ervable on the Greek monarchic medals, from the earlie&s;t ages to the la&s;t; and is almo&s;t an infallible &s;ign of the portrait of a prince. In the Roman coins it is &s;een on the con&s;ular ones of Numa and Ancus; but never after, if I am not mi&s;|taken, till the time of Licinius. So great an aver&s;ion had the Romans to this kingly di&s;tinc|tion, that their emperors had, almo&s;t for an age, worn the radiated crown, peculiar to the gods, before they dared to a&s;&s;ume this tyranni$ badge. In the family of Con&s;tantine the dia|dem becomes common, though not with the ancient &s;implicity, being ornamented on either edge with a row of pearls.</P>
<P>The radiated crown, at fir&s;t, as on the po&s;t|humous coins of Augu&s;tus, a mark of deifica|tion,
<PB N="81" REF="121">was in little more than a century after put upon mo&s;t of the emperors' heads in their &s;e|veral medals.</P>
<P>The crown of laurel was at fir&s;t the honorary prize of conquerors, but afterwards commonly worn, at lea&s;t in their medals, by all the Ro|man emperors from Julius, who was permitted by the &s;enate to wear it always, to hide the baldne&s;s of his forehead. This perhaps gave ri&s;e to the fir&s;t emperors always appearing with it on their coins, a circum&s;tance continued to our times with a mo&s;t ri&s;ible and truly Gothic ab&s;urdity. The laurel, employed by the an|cients in forming their crowns, is undoubtedly what we term the Alexandrian laurel, a mo&s;t beautiful evergreen, of a fine and tender ver|dure.</P>
<P>Agrippa appears on his coins with the ro&s;tral crown, a &s;ign of naval victory or command, being made of gold, in re&s;emblance of prows of &s;hips tied together. He is likewi&s;e &s;een with the mural or turreted crown, the prize of fir&s;t a&s;cending the walls of an enemy's city.</P>
<P>The oaken, or civic crown, is frequent on rever&s;es, as of Galba, and others; and was the badge of having &s;aved the life of a citizen, or of many citizens.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the diadem, the Greek princes &s;ome|times appear with the laurel crown. The Ar|&s;acidae, or kings of Parthia, wear a kind of
<PB N="82" REF="122">&s;a&s;h round the head, with their hair in rows o$ curls like a wig. Tigranes, and the kings o$ Armenia, wear the <HI>tiara,</HI> a &s;ingular kind o$ cap, but the well known badge of imperia$ power in the ancient ea&s;tern world. Xerxes, a petty prince of Armenia, appears in a coi$ extant of him in a conic cap, with a diadem around it. Juba the father has a &s;ingular crown, like a conic cap made of leaves of oak.</P>
<P>The kings of Syria a&s;&s;umed, by way of di&s;|tinction, different &s;ymbols of deity, to be ob|&s;erved on the bu&s;ts of their medals. Such a$ the lion's &s;kin of Hercules, which &s;urrounds the head of the fir&s;t Seleucus; the ram's hor$ placed behind the ear, a &s;criptural image o$ their &s;trength and power, or of their being the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander, called the &s;on of Jupi|ter Ammon; the wing placed, in like manner, behind the ear, &s;ymbolic of the rapidity of their conque&s;ts, or of their de&s;cendance from the god Mercury; and the like.</P>
<P>The empre&s;&s;es and queens never, &s;o far as I remember, are &s;een with the diadem of any kind. The variety of their head-dre&s;&s;es more than compen&s;ates for the want of this orna|ment.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the di&s;tinctions of &s;upreme power, or honorary reward, there are other &s;ymbolic or|naments of the head ob&s;ervable on &s;ome Ro|man coins which ought to be mentioned. Such
<PB N="83" REF="123">is the veil, or more properly the <HI>toga,</HI> drawn over the head, to be &s;een on the bu&s;ts of Julius Cae&s;ar and Lepidus on their coins. This &s;hews that the per&s;on bore the pontificate, or the au|gur&s;hip; the augurs having a particular gown, called <HI>laena,</HI> with which they covered their heads when employed in ob&s;erving the omens. The veil of Fau&s;tina and other empre&s;&s;es, denotes them to have held &s;ome &s;acred dignity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XII.</HI> Their Legends.</HEAD>
<P>MOST coins, along with the portrait it front and various figures in the rever&s;e have likewi&s;e words, explicative of &s;ome cir|cum&s;tance concerning them, marked on one o$ both &s;ides. The early Greek coins of cities commonly only contain the name of the city, o$ the initial letters of it; as tho&s;e of the Greek princes their name, the beginning characters of it, or its monogram<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A monogram, with medalli&s;ts, is the name of a prince, city or the like, of which the characters are woven together, &s;o $word$ &s;peak, and the limb of one character perhaps applies to three o$ four others; &s;o that in the &s;mall room of one or two characters $word$ whole name is comprehended.</NOTE>. But in the Roman
<PB N="85" REF="125">and Greek imperial medals there is &s;ome|times not only a literal information around the face, and around the rever&s;e, but likewi&s;e in the field of the rever&s;e, which in &s;uch in&s;tances often con&s;i&s;ts wholly of this intelligence, with|out any figures whatever. When the letters or words of a medal thus occupy the field, they are called an <HI>in&s;cription;</HI> but when they run round the margin, are on either &s;ide of the figures, or upon the exergue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The exergue is the bottom of a coin, commonly &s;eparated from $he field by a line, upon which the figures of the rever&s;e &s;tand. $word$ is &s;o called from being <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>out of the work</HI> of the medal.</NOTE>, they are denominated a <HI>le|gend.</HI></P>
<P>The French, who are fond of devices, call the figures the <HI>body,</HI> and the legend the <HI>&s;oul,</HI> of a medal.</P>
<P>The legends of the earlie&s;t Greek coins, as above ob&s;erved, are very brief, rehear&s;ing only the initials of the city, or prince; as A&THgr;E, money of Athens; AM, money coined by Au|myntas king of Macedon. Afterwards the name is put at full length, as &Sgr;&Ugr;PAKO&Ugr;&Sgr;I&OHgr;N, coin of the Syracu&s;ians; &PHgr;I&Lgr;I&Pgr;IIO&Ugr;, coin of Philip of Macedon. In proce&s;s of time the Syrian and Egyptian kings, &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alex|ander, added &s;ome epithet which did them prai&s;e, as E&Ugr;EP&Ggr;ETH&Sgr;, beneficent, or the like; together with the title of BA&Sgr;I&Lgr;E&Ugr;&Sgr;, or king; and the year of their aera in which the coin was
<PB N="86" REF="126">&s;truck. Such the Greek coinage remained till the univer&s;ality of the Roman empire &s;wallowed up all the kingdoms and cities which u&s;ed that language.</P>
<P>Under the dominion of the Roman emperor$ the Grecian mint a&s;&s;umed more of the Roman form, then indeed more perfect, as to legend, than their own. On the face they gave the Roman emperor, or empre&s;s, with their titles; the founder of their city, with his name; the &s;enate, or the people of Rome, who had pro|tected them; or the ideal bu&s;t of the genius o$ their city: while the rever&s;e pre&s;ents us with a legend indicative of the name of the magi&s;trate under whom the money was &s;truck; of &s;ome treaty entered into with one or more neigh|bouring &s;tates; of the river, or deity, repre|&s;ented; and the like. Yet it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, to the credit of the Greek arti&s;ts, even when their genius was depre&s;&s;ed by the Roman power, that they &s;eldom or never explain by their legends the rever&s;es of their coins, but leave it to the &s;pectator; commonly, and al|mo&s;t univer&s;ally, putting for the legend of the rever&s;e the name of the city, and frequently adding that of the magi&s;trate. The &s;ymbols of the deities were indeed &s;o familiar as to require no explanatory legend; and per&s;onifications are very rare in Greek coins, except tho&s;e of their cities and rivers. A few in&s;tances how|ever
<PB N="87" REF="127">occur of them, and they are commonly accompanied by an illu&s;trative legend; as on the rever&s;e of a very rare Otho, where we &s;ee his victory over Galba, imaged by a placid female figure, with a victory in one hand, and a tro|phy in the other, with this legend, KPA&Sgr;I&Sgr;, Moderation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spon, Voyage du Levant, tome III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In&s;criptions filling the whole field of the re|ver&s;e are not &s;o common in Greek coins. A few however there are, and particularly upon tho&s;e of Smyrna. The imperial medals &s;truck at Antioch are always very remarkable, from the letters S. C. in&s;cribed on their rever&s;es, within a peculiar crown, or wreath. Sometimes they have longer in&s;criptions; as in that mo&s;t capi|tal coin of Otho, of large bra&s;s, which is in Dr. Hunter's collection; upon which we read, within the u&s;ual wreath of Antiochian medals, EIII MO&Ugr;KIANO&Ugr; ANTIOXE&OHgr;N, with the aera ET. ZIP. How the people of Antioch hap|pened to adopt the S. C. &s;ignifying SENATVS CONSVLTO, "by decree of the &s;enate," a mark almo&s;t peculiar to the Roman mint, in &s;o many of their imperial coins, is a paradox not ex|plained, and not attempted to be explained, by medallic authors.</P>
<P>This leads me to ob&s;erve, that the noted S. C. or mark of the authority of the &s;enate of
<PB N="88" REF="128">Rome for &s;triking any coin, never appears upon tho&s;e of gold or &s;ilver, in the &s;en&s;e we are to con&s;true it, when it occurs upon the bra&s;s, Medalli&s;ts lay it down as an infallible rule, that this mark upon gold and &s;ilver coins always re|fers to the &s;ubject of the rever&s;e upon which it is &s;tamped, and not to the coin it&s;elf. So far as we can learn, the Roman emperors had the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of the gold and &s;ilver coinage, but le&s;t that of bra&s;s entirely to the &s;enate. Hence the S. C. is never wanting upon the bra&s;s, and in very few in&s;tances appears upon the &s;uperior metals; where it is always under&s;tood to refer to the device of the coin, as a &s;tatue, a trium|phal arch, or the like, erected by decree of the &s;enate; and not to the coin it&s;elf, as i&s;&s;ued in virtue of that decree.</P>
<P>The &s;implicity of the legends to be found upon the early Greek coins has already fallen under ob&s;ervation; tho&s;e of the Roman, with equal &s;implicity at fir&s;t, by degrees proceeded to more explicit length, and at length, from elegant and &s;imple veracity, degenerated into flattery. The&s;e remarks refer to the legends of the obver&s;e, for tho&s;e of the rever&s;e began to flatter as &s;oon as there was a prince, an idol upon who&s;e altar to burn the cloudy perfume. We find Clemency and Moderation upon the medals of Tiberius, as well as equivalent vir|tues upon tho&s;e of Titus. The DIVI FILIVS,
<PB N="89" REF="129">"the &s;on of Augu&s;tus the deity," upon the ob|ver&s;es of Tiberius, is a title more of &s;ecurity than flattery: but upon tho&s;e of the following princes we find nothing more than their names, with the date of their Tribunician power, or of their Con&s;ul&s;hip, and the glorious title of PATER PATRIAE, the father of their country, till Com|modus added the title of FELIX, followed by that of PIVS, and at length by the tyrannic pre|face of D. N., DOMINVS NOSTER, Our Lord. In the lower empire Michael fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the proud addition of BA&Sgr;I&Lgr;E&Ugr;&Sgr;, or king; which was followed by that of &Dgr;H&Sgr;&Pgr;OTO&Sgr;, or de&s;pot.</P>
<P>The rever&s;es of the very fir&s;t imperial coins are not however wanting in adulation, nor is it to be wondered at, when we con&s;ider that Virgil and Horace, men of the mo&s;t enlightened minds, whatever may be decided of their claim to ge|nius, were yet capable of even forgetting the &s;a|cred dignity of poetry, and pro&s;tituting it at the bloody foot&s;tool of a tyrant. What Monte&s;|quieu &s;ays of the Engli&s;h, that, if ever they were reduced to be &s;laves, they would prove the meane&s;t of all &s;laves, was exemplified in the conduct of the ancient Romans. This can no way be better proved than from the coin &s;truck by decree of the &s;enate, in which we find all the virtues a&s;cribed to the mo&s;t infamous &s;et of mon&s;ters that ever di&s;graced humanity. It may
<PB N="90" REF="130">however be &s;aid, in vindication of the Romans that the a&s;cribing of virtues to princes, from who&s;e hearts they were mo&s;t di&s;tant, was the only method which they dared to u&s;e to remin$ them of their duty to their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, however, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vir|tuous monarchs authori&s;ed the rever&s;es &s;o fo|reign to mo&s;t of their praedece&s;&s;ors. S. P. Q R. OPTIMO PRINCIPI, &s;o common on the coins o$ Trajan, is not flattery, but glory. All the vir|tues appear without impropriety on the medals of Nerva, Trajan, Adrian, and the Antonini.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t equal in ju&s;tice and glory to the OP|TIMO PRINCIPI of Trajan is a rever&s;e of the emperor Ju&s;tinian, on which is the portrait o$ Beli&s;arius, with this legend, GLORIA ROMANO|RVM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patin, Hi&s;t. des Medailles. I have never &s;een this coin either in books or cabinets.</NOTE>. But, in proportion as the empire de|clined, the more common are flattery and gro&s;s impropriety in the legends of the Roman coin. So early as the time of Severus we find this upon one of Julia his wife, MATer AVGG. MA|Ter SENATVS, MATer PATRIAE.</P>
<P>The Greeks, ingenious in faults as in virtues, likewi&s;e carried their flattery of their Roman ma&s;ters as far as it would well go. Certain it is that they &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Romans them&s;elves in this ba&s;e art. We have a Greek medal of
<PB N="91" REF="131">Commodus with a legend, implying that while that emperor reigned all the world was ble&s;t; a piece of adulation and fal&s;hood only to be equalled by an in&s;cription pre&s;erved in the gar|den of the Villa Borghe&s;e at Fra&s;cati, and for|merly placed under a &s;tatue of Caracalla, in which, among other titles, is NVMINI PRAE|SENTI, "to the pre&s;ent deity." Among other in&s;tances of the Grecian art of conciliating the favour of their ma&s;ters, may be mentioned that of fir&s;t winning the protection of the empre&s;s, and other imperial ladies, by &s;triking beautiful medals in their honour: a flattery to which we are indebted for many a fine portrait not to be found in the Roman coinage.</P>
<P>But it is time that we &s;hould proceed to &s;ome few other particulars ob&s;ervable in the legends of ancient medals. Upon many of the coins &s;truck in the Greek cities we find the legend of the obver&s;e in Latin, while that of the rever&s;e is in Greek. The rea&s;on of this, medallic writers have endeavoured to account for in many ways, but appear not to me to have lighted upon the truth, which &s;eems to be, that the magi&s;trate of &s;uch country mint, not having any portrait of the emperor, &s;ent to Rome for one, which was returned in a die ready cut with the legend. To this a rever&s;e was made by the Greek arti&s;ts, the magi&s;trate inclining to &s;ave the expence of cutting another obver&s;e. In confirmation of this
<PB N="92" REF="132">opinion, I believe, it will be found that few $word$ no coins are found with Latin legends on th$ rever&s;e and Greek, in front.</P>
<P>Perhaps the mo&s;t remarkable feature in th$ legends and in&s;criptions of Greek imperial me|dals is the addition, almo&s;t perpetual, of th$ title NE&OHgr;KOPO&Sgr; to the names of certain cities The word is equivalent to the Latin <HI>Aedituus</HI> and will, in &s;pite of my reader's &s;mile, bear th$ Engli&s;h interpretation of Churchwarden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word is derived by the etymologi&s;ts from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>a temple,</HI> and <HI>$word$, to &s;weep:</HI> the humble primitive meaning is therefore <HI>temple-$$eepers.</HI> In Acts xix. 35, we are told that Ephe&s;us was the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or city devoted to the wor&s;hip of Diana.</NOTE>. I implies that the cities who adopted that appel|lation looked upon them&s;elves as guardians o$ the &s;hrine of &s;ome celebrated deity, who&s;e de|voted wor&s;hippers they were; and of con&s;e|quence ble&s;t in the immediate and peculiar protection of &s;uch heavenly power. At other times it &s;ignifies &s;olely the latter circum&s;tan$$ of particular favour; and in this &s;en&s;e we meet with NE&OHgr;KOP&OHgr;N TO&Ugr; &Sgr;EBA&Sgr;TO&Ugr;, the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of the emperor, and the like; tho in &s;ome in&s;tances this may be doubtle&s;s applied in the full &s;en&s;e of the word; for temples of different &Sgr;EBA&Sgr;TOI, or emperors, were frequent in the Greek cities, as marks of &s;uperlative flattery. Nor let us wonder that the mo&s;t important Greek cities e&s;teemed them&s;elves honoured in a
<PB N="93" REF="133">title which to us appears, at fir&s;t glanoe, &s;o trifling; for the celebrated temples, &s;uch as that of Diana at Ephe&s;us, and others, were the grand &s;ources of all the wealth and power of tho&s;e cities who were their guardians. By them &s;trangers were induced to crowd their &s;treets, and lay out their money to enrich the inhabitants. Hence their wealth: and all po&s;|&s;ible power was derived from the va&s;t influence which the&s;e holy cities had over others, in vir|tue of the &s;acred depo&s;its committed to their care, and the imaginary, but no le&s;s &s;trong, horror of the pre&s;ent deity. Both the autho|rity and the opulence of the&s;e cities were in|crea&s;ed by &s;olemn and pompous games, cele|brated at di&s;tant periods, in honour of their guardian divinity. At the&s;e games the empe|rors, &s;ometimes pre&s;ent, and at other times by commi&s;&s;ion, cau&s;ed &s;uch cities to be &s;olemnly proclaimed NE&OHgr;KOPOI, as a &s;ingular badge of their favour: and hence in coins and in&s;crip|tions we often find B. NE&OHgr;KOP&OHgr;N, T. NE&OHgr;|KOP&OHgr;N, &Dgr;I&Sgr; NE&OHgr;KOP&OHgr;N, TPI&Sgr; NE&OHgr;KO|P&OHgr;N, implying that the inhabitants had been twice or thrice, or oftener, honoured with this &s;olemn di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance almo&s;t as remarkable of the Roman medals, is the in&s;cription VOT. V. MVI. T. X., VOT. X. MVLTIS XX., to be found upon many rever&s;es, and mo&s;t commonly marked on a
<PB N="94" REF="134">&s;hield, or within a crown of laurel. This Du$ Cange interprets to refer to the artifice of Au|gu&s;tus, who pretended to lay down his power, and re&s;ume it for ten years longer as at the re|que&s;t of the &s;enate. This term, &s;ays he, was by &s;ucceeding emperors &s;hortened to five; and &s;olemn vows were entered into by their &s;ubjects for their &s;afety to the end of that period; nay, that double that period might be allotted to their reign, again to be prolonged, in the wi&s;hes of their people, to a further date. To confute this opinion, we need only refer to the coins of Cri&s;pus, and the other Cae&s;ars, upon which this in&s;cription is &s;o common, and from which it is palpable that it can have no reference to their reign, nor to the art of Augu&s;tus. However, while the opinion of Du Cange is rejected, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that no other interpretation has been offered, and this in&s;cription mu&s;t, &s;o far as can be &s;een, be left in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The compa&s;s of a coin is &s;o &s;mall, that arti&s;ts have always been obliged to u&s;e abbreviations in the legends and in&s;criptions. An explana|tion of the mo&s;t common of the&s;e, originally drawn up by Patin, will be found in the Ap|pendix. For any which do not there occur, the reader may have recour&s;e to the large work of Ur&s;atus, <HI>De Notis Romanorum.</HI> The Greeks do not deal &s;o much in abbreviations, and when
<PB N="95" REF="135">they u&s;e them, &s;o much of the word is commonly given as to leave no doubt of the whole. A very little &s;tudy of the Greek medals will enable any one to peru&s;e their legends with facility, e&s;pecially with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any work on Greek coins. It may however be ob&s;erved, that the interpretation of letters which do not often occur is a dangerous attempt, either with regard to the Roman or Greek coins. The ri&s;ible blunders of father Hardouin on the for|mer are well known; and it was Fortunius Li|cetus, a man of learning, who di&s;covered that A. I&Dgr;., upon a coin of Hadrian, implying the fourteenth year of his reign, &s;ignified <HI>Lucernas invenit Delta;</HI> and who from thence a&s;cribed the invention of lanthorns to Egypt.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XIII.</HI> Medallions.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to the particular con|&s;ideration of the coins of different nations, it will be proper to examine the medallions. Under this term are included all tho&s;e pieces, produced by the ancient mints, which, from their &s;uperior &s;ize, were evidently not intended for circulation as coin, but for other occa&s;ions. Such were public games, when the emperor u&s;ed to &s;catter them among the people; whence the Romans called them <HI>Mi&s;&s;ilia:</HI>&mdash;a dangerous diver&s;ion for the mob, whatever amu&s;ement the &s;truggle might afford to the &s;uperior &s;pectators! Medallions were likewi&s;e pre&s;ented by the em|peror to his friends, and by the mint-ma&s;ters to
<PB N="97" REF="137">the emperor, as &s;pecimens of fine workman&s;hip: they were &s;truck upon the commencement of the reign of a new emperor, and other &s;olemn occa&s;ions: and frequently, the Greek in par|ticular, as monuments of gratitude, or of flat|tery. Sometimes they were merely what we would call trial, or pattern, pieces; <HI>te&s;timonia probatae monetae;</HI> and &s;uch mu&s;t be the mo&s;t uncommon.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. VI.</NOTE>, that all Roman pieces in gold, exceeding the denarius aureus; all in &s;ilver, &s;uperior in &s;ize to the denarius; and all in bra&s;s, &s;uperior to the <HI>as,</HI> or what the medalli&s;ts term large bra&s;s; fall under this de|&s;cription. Such, at lea&s;t, is the common divi|&s;ion; but, in my opinion, the gold medallions weighing two, three, or four aurei only, pa&s;&s;ed in currency as the Greek gold didrachms, tri|drachms, or tetradrachms, according to their &s;ize. The like may be &s;aid of the &s;ilver, which are not rare, and are commonly of the value of a Greek tetradrachm: they, I have little doubt, went in currency for four denarii. This opi|nion may be confirmed by ob&s;erving, that, in our own coinage, the five and two guinea pieces, and the crowns in &s;ilver, are as &s;carce in pro|portion as the Roman gold and &s;ilver medal|lions.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="138">
<P>But whether any of the&s;e pieces called me+dallions pa&s;&s;ed as coin with the ancients, is $ matter of no moment; it is &s;ufficient to have pointed out what articles are now accounted o$ that cla&s;s. The bra&s;s medallions, as the large&s;t &s;o are commonly of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite work man&s;hip, and uncommon device. Many o$ them are compo&s;ed of two &s;orts of metal, th$ center being copper, with a ring of bra&s;s around it; or the contrary. The in&s;cription of &s;uch &s;ometimes bites upon both metals, and at othe$ times runs upon one. Medallions of this kin$ are inimitable, and of undoubted antiquity.</P>
<P>Medallions, from the time of Julius to tha$ of Hadrian, are very uncommon, and of va$ price: from Hadrian to Po&s;tumus they are generally &s;peaking, le&s;s rare: very few meda+llions appear after Po&s;tumus; and &s;o few of th$ large bra&s;s coins, that they always rank wit$ medallions of the reigns of all the &s;ucceedin$ princes.</P>
<P>Hardly any Roman medallion is to be foun$ of which the whole type is not repeated upo$ common coin. Hence they appear not of $word$ much importance as the Greek, whereof th$ impre&s;&s;ions are frequently mo&s;t uncommon, an$ no where el&s;e to be found. A remarkable di$+tinction between the Greek and Roman meda+llions lies in their different thickne&s;s, the R$|man
<PB N="99" REF="139">being often three or four lines thick, while the other &s;eldom exceed one. When I &s;peak of the Greek medallions, I mean tho&s;e &s;truck in the imperial periods: for few or no Greek medallions are found prior to the emperors of Rome.</P>
<P>All medallions, &s;ave in one or two in&s;tances, are very rare, and of princely purcha&s;e; for which rea&s;on I &s;hall not enlarge any more upon them, but content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that, even in the riche&s;t cabinets, twenty or thirty medallions are e&s;teemed of great weight. In the la&s;t century, however, Chri&s;tina, queen of Sweden, was &s;o fortunate as to procure about three hundred; and the king of France's cabi|net, the mo&s;t opulent and wonderful collection of medals ever &s;een, has by degrees attained to about twelve hundred medallions; a number in former times not believed to exi&s;t.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XIV.</HI> Medals called <HI>Contorniati.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS cla&s;s ought likewi&s;e to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before proceeding to the common coin$ of antiquity. They are &s;o called from the Ita|lian CONTORNIATO, <HI>encircled;</HI> becau&s;e of the hollow circle which commonly runs around them: and are not di&s;tingui&s;hed from medal|lions by their &s;ize, but by their thinne&s;s; fain$ relief; rever&s;es &s;ometimes in <HI>intaglio,</HI> hollowed, not rai&s;ed; and, in general, by their peculia$ and inferior workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>Many and various have been the opinions o$ medallic writers re&s;pecting the&s;e &s;ingular piece$
<PB N="101" REF="141">of coinage. Some &s;uppo&s;e them &s;truck by Gallienus, to the memory of illu&s;trious men, and celebrated <HI>athletae,</HI> at the time when he cau&s;ed all the con&s;ecration coins of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors to be re&s;tored. This &s;entiment &s;eems nearly adopted by M. Mahudel, who &s;ays, the <HI>contorniati</HI> were &s;truck originally at Rome, about the clo&s;e of the third century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t, de l'Acad. des Belles Lettres, tome V. p. 284.</NOTE>. Others a&s;cribe their invention to Greece, and that in her days of glory; becau&s;e they bear frequently the names and images of illu&s;trious Greeks, as Homer, Pythagoras, Socrates; and of Grecian <HI>athletae,</HI> or actors in the games.</P>
<P>Other opinions have been given, which to enumerate were &s;uperfluous. I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with &s;ubmitting an opinion to the reader, which I have as yet found in no author, together with a few arguments to en|force it.</P>
<P>Upon the very fir&s;t &s;ight I had of <HI>contorniati</HI> coins, it &s;truck me that they could be nothing el&s;e than tickets for different places in the pub|lic games. The dye, appearance, device, in|&s;cription of the rever&s;e, every thing, confirmed this opinion, which I have &s;ince had the plea|&s;ure to find perfectly con&s;onant to that of two or three of the fir&s;t medalli&s;ts in this country.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="142">
<P>The&s;e pieces, tho of different kinds, are mo&s;tly of a &s;ize between two and three inche$ diameter. Some have, upon the obver&s;e part$ the head of the emperor, or empre&s;s, who gave the games; and almo&s;t a &s;eries might be formed of them, from Augu&s;tus down to Gal|lienus. What &s;trengthens my opinion very much is, that &s;uch emperors as were remarkable for their attachment to public diver&s;ions occur very frequently on the&s;e pieces, which we &s;hall in future call <HI>ticket-medals,</HI> if the reader will; whereas the others appear more &s;eldom, and tho&s;e who never pre&s;ented any games, not at all. Nero, for in&s;tance, is &s;o common on their ob|ver&s;es, that his ticket-medals &s;ell for almo&s;t no price at all.</P>
<P>Other obver&s;es are mo&s;t precious from pre|&s;erving to us the portraits of illu&s;trious authors of antiquity, no where el&s;e to be found. Sal|lu&s;t, Horace, and other Roman writers, were delineated on the&s;e tickets, when the memory of their per&s;ons was yet fre&s;h to the inhabitants of Rome, and their portraits may therefore be depended on. So much cannot be &s;aid for the Greek portraits, in this way, of Homer, Solon, Pythagoras, Socrates, and others, all which I take to have been &s;truck at Rome, when Gre|cian actors were to perform; or in the Grecian cities during the Roman empire. However,
<PB N="103" REF="143">even the&s;e are valuable, as being ancient, and perhaps traditional, portraits of tho&s;e great men.</P>
<P>A few obver&s;es again pre&s;ent <HI>athletae,</HI> or actors in the games, and &s;uch are commonly repre&s;ented holding a hor&s;e by the rein, or in &s;ome other attitude peculiar to their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the rever&s;es pre&s;ent the mo&s;t certain ar|guments for the opinion I have advanced with regard to the u&s;e of the&s;e pieces: for on them there is almo&s;t always a charioteer driving a chariot, or &s;ome &s;imilar device, peculiar to public games, and to them alone. Tho&s;e &s;truck for the theatre are the mo&s;t &s;carce, and have &s;ometimes an actor at full length on the rever&s;e, with PLACEAS, "maye&s;t thou plea&s;e!" or &s;ome &s;uch legend. One, in particular, has a bu&s;t of Sallu&s;t on the obver&s;e; and on the other &s;ide, three per&s;ons, one of whom has an in&s;trument re&s;embling the common flute; an|other, an in&s;trument like the &s;cenic flute &s;een in the hands of Pan; while the third is de|claiming. The legend is PETRONI PLACEAS, "maye&s;t thou plea&s;e, Petronius!" The per&s;on repre&s;ented declaiming is evidently this Petro|nius, who was perhaps that day to make his fir&s;t appearance upon the Roman &s;tage; and the whole de&s;ign, of this la&s;t in&s;tance in parti|cular, is &s;o clear, that it moves &s;urprize how
<PB N="104" REF="144">the intention of the&s;e tickets could &s;o long have e&s;caped the medallic authors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tickets of this kind are u&s;ed for the pit, to this day, at ou$ theatres.

<P>It has been &s;aid above, that the&s;e pieces wer$ tickets for different &s;eats or places at the games What leads to this &s;uppo&s;ition is the variety o$ marks to be found on the obver&s;es of them Some have a &s;prig of laurel; others a P, wit$ an E below it, which la&s;t is very common others, a particular animal, or &s;ome &s;uch badge All the&s;e marks, in &s;uch tickets as are perfectly pre&s;erved, are cut in the bra&s;s, and then filled up with &s;ilver. There is in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum a fine collection of upwards of one hundred of the&s;e pieces, pre&s;ented to that noble in&s;titu|tion by the Earl of Exeter, upon one of which the head of an empre&s;s, Fau&s;tina, I think, i$ &s;ingularly adorned with a line of &s;ilver border|ing her head-dre&s;s, and another around he$ neck.

<P>THE Greek coins, if not the mo&s;t ancien$ which we have, are at lea&s;t of &s;uperior antiquity to any who&s;e dates can be clearly au+thenticated. Perhaps &s;ome of the Barbari$ pieces, tho&s;e of Per&s;ia, or other ea&s;tern coun|tries, for in&s;tance, may have a claim to priority of aera; but as that claim is latent, and mu&s;$ ever be &s;o, owing to &s;uch coins having no le|gends, or legends in characters irretrievably lo&s;t, we mu&s;t allot to the Grecian medals that place in a cabinet, from their antiquity, which their workman&s;hip might en&s;ure to them, in|dependent of that adventitious con&s;ideration.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="147">
<P>The invention of coinage, like that of other fine arts, is very ob&s;cure. We know that the Egyptians, who claim the origin of many of the arts, have no title to this; for no Egyptian coins with hieroglyphics are found; nor any that are charged with the deities of Nile, till the introduction of the Greek language into that country under the Ptolemies.</P>
<P>Herodotus, in his fir&s;t book, informs us, that the people of Lydia, a country in A&s;ia Minor, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the fir&s;t who coined money. This is thought to have been about the time of Homer, upwards of one thou&s;and years before the Chri&s;tian aera.</P>
<P>Whether this art was really invented by the Lydians, and by them fir&s;t &s;ub&s;tituted to the ancient ea&s;tern mode of weighing the metal, or whether they received it from their more ea&s;tern neighbours the Per&s;ians, and were con|&s;idered by the Greeks as the original inventors, becau&s;e they handed the art to Greece, cannot be decided. Lydia was, for many centuries after the period to which this invention is a&s;cribed, a powerful and opulent kingdom, till Croe&s;us the la&s;t king, &s;o celebrated for his wealth, was conquered by Camby&s;es king of Per&s;ia; &s;o that it is not at all improbable that to &s;o rich and flouri&s;hing a &s;tate$ he very origin of coinage may be due.</P>

Medalli&s;ts, in deed, impute them to Aegium in Achaia, a place almo&s;t unknown, and where, I will ven+ture to &s;ay, there never was a &s;hadow of a mint; merely becau&s;e they look upon the tor|toi&s;e as a &s;ure &s;ymbol of coins &s;truck &s;ome|where in the Peloponne&s;us: when the mo&s;t &s;uperficial examination mu&s;t convince them that the&s;e &s;ymbols are mo&s;t uncertain, every city having a great number, and perpetually chang|ing them, &s;o that no man would found any thing upon them, except one who is found of building ca&s;tles in the air.

<P>I have dwelt the longer on this point be|cau&s;e that in great cabinets the&s;e coins com|monly occur; and it is a curious fact that the&s;e are the mo&s;t ancient that can be any ways iden|tified. Not to mention that it is a &s;ingular in|&s;tance of the uncertainty of &s;ome parts of this &s;cience, and how ill the general principles of medallic writers apply to particular examples, as this of a king of Argos e&s;tabli&s;hing his mint in Aegina. Indeed, when a medallic au|thor falls into an error, he is commonly blindly followed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who are generally inclined to &s;ave the trouble of con&s;ulting the original authors of antiquity, by taking upon credit the &s;uperficial opinions of tho&s;e who have written on the &s;cience before them. By this blunders are propagated to an endle&s;s degree: and the la&s;t medallic writers &s;eek to cover their depredations from the former only by railing at them in conver&s;ation; in imitation of Voltaire's conduct to Shak&s;pere.</P>
<P>The&s;e coins of Aegina, and all others of mo&s;t remote antiquity, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the&s;e infallible marks: 1. Their oval circum|ference,

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e coins of Aegina, many ancient medals of different &s;tates occur with all the&s;e marks of profound antiquity. Tho&s;e of Athens, Tegea, and two or three other cities; &s;ome Per&s;ian &s;ilver pieces, with the archer upon one &s;ide, and the hollow &s;quare upon the other; &s;everal coins of the fir&s;t kings of Macedon, are examples. There is in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, a medal of &s;ilver, a&s;cribed to Le&s;bos, of this de|&s;cription, upon which much has been &s;aid and written. The art mu&s;t have circulated widely before the &s;quare on the rever&s;e was obliterated by &s;uperior art in the fabric; for I have &s;een a &s;ilver drachm of Cyrene, with the <HI>&s;ylphium</HI> upon one &s;ide, and a head of Jupiter Ammon upon the other, evidently of Grecian workman&s;hip, upon both &s;ides of which the &s;quare was very vi&s;ible.</P>
<PB N="111" REF="151">
<P>But in a &s;hort time the Greek coins a&s;&s;umed that elegance which they were ever afterwards to afford. Innumerable of the medals of cities, which, from the character, we mu&s;t judge of highe&s;t antiquity, have a &s;urprizing &s;trength, beauty, and relief, in their impre&s;&s;ions. Many of tho&s;e of the early Macedonian, and other monarchs, are entitled to no le&s;s prai&s;e: but, about the time of Alexander the Great, the art &s;eems to have attained its very highe&s;t perfec|tion.</P>
<P>It is &s;omething &s;urpri&s;ing, with regard to the coins of this prince, that his own portrait &s;o &s;eldom occurs on them; or, if it does, is &s;o di&s;|gui&s;ed, that medalli&s;ts, after de&s;cribing tho&s;e with the bu&s;t of Hercules, of Jupiter Ammon, and a variety of others, as infallibly &s;tamped with the image of Alexander, and being forced to relinqui&s;h the&s;e opinions by finding tho&s;e very heads upon coins &s;truck before the birth of that prince, &s;eem at la&s;t determined to be|lieve that no head of Alexander is to be found on any medal whatever. But this opinion is doubtle&s;s too wide. Where a coin of this cele|brated monarch occurs with the head bare, or circled with a diadem, there can be no doubt of its bearing his portrait. The coins of Alex|ander are all very common, &s;ave &s;ilver di|drachms, which are &s;o rare as to be almo&s;t unique. His rever&s;es commonly bear a Jupiter

Tome I. p. 14.</NOTE>, mu&s;t be thus interpreted. The &s;phin$ is the &s;ign of Chios: the griffin, of Teos, an$ Abdera: the lion's head in profile, of Cyzicu$ or Cnidus: the hor&s;e's head, of Egea in Cilicia$ the bee, of Ephe&s;us: the ro&s;e, of Rhodes: th$ anchor, of Ancyra: the double axe, of Ten$ dos: the torch, of Amphipolis. An ancie$ author informs us, that &s;ome coins, and tho&s;e $ Alexander in particular, u&s;ed to be worn a amulets; and many medals occur in cabinets evidently bored with this intention.</P>
<P>The coins of the Syrian and Egyptian kings &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander, yield not to his i$ beauty and bold relief. Even the Parthia$ coins of the Ar&s;acidae are worthy the Grecian workmen, who&s;e they are, as is evident from th$ Greek legends impre&s;t on them; in very many of which the&s;e monarchs a&s;&s;ume the &s;ingula$ title of &PHgr;I&Lgr;E&Lgr;HNIKO&Sgr;, or LOVER OF THE GREEKS. Mo&s;t of the Parthian coins are drachms; the other &s;izes frequently occur it tho&s;e of Egypt and Syria.</P>
<P>How the Grecian language and character come to appear upon the latter Parthian me|dals,
<PB N="113" REF="153">cannot be explained, but from the excel|lence, and con&s;equent univer&s;ality, of that &s;peech at the time. Indeed it is no wonder, that a language, in which genius had fir&s;t &s;poken, &s;hould have attracted the admiration of all nations. The Grecian tongue acquired that preeminence from its writers, which the Latin gained afterwards from the force of the Roman arms alone; for no writer in that language di&s;played that miraculous originality of genius which &s;hines in the Grecian productions. The be&s;t Roman writers thought them&s;elves fortu|nate if they could &s;teal from the Greeks with &s;ome dexterity; and their Virgil, whom they fondly cla&s;&s;ed as their fir&s;t poet, obtained that title becau&s;e he was the chief of the robbers, and had not a &s;ingle thing in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which was not &s;tolen. It is amu&s;ing to ob&s;erve upon medals the progre&s;s of the Greek tongue: the very improvement of the character, and other trifles, delight the legitimate admirer of the divine writers of that great country; him I mean who reads them in the original lan|guage, where only they are to be known in all their beauty and maje&s;ty. From the intro|duction of &s;ome characters, the antiquity al&s;o of Greek coins may be a&s;certained; the H and &OHgr;, for in&s;tance, not being known in Greece till the archon&s;hip of Euclid, which falls into the

<P>Of the Greek medals tho&s;e of cities are th$ mo&s;t ancient; that is, we have &s;everal evidently &s;truck before tho&s;e of the Macedonian princes the mo&s;t early &s;eries of monarchic coins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e of Phidon, or rather of Aegina, not having, at any rare, any mark of that prince, always $ank with the cities.</NOTE>.

<P>IT is a little &s;urpri&s;ing, that, tho the Grecian coinage was carried to high perfection before the foundation of Rome, yet near two centuries more &s;hould elap&s;e ere any mint was known to the Romans. For, according to the be&s;t authorities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. XXXIII. C. iii.</NOTE>, it was in the reign of Servius Tullius that the fir&s;t Roman coins were &s;truck, which were large pieces of bra&s;s, rudely im|pre&s;&s;ed, on one &s;ide only, with the figure of an ox, a ram, or &s;ome other animal, whence money it is &s;aid derived its Latin term of <HI>pecu|nia.</HI> The&s;e &s;ymbols, the ox in particular, were
<PB N="118" REF="158">derived from the coins of the Umbri, a people of Italy, originally Lydians, according to He$ rodotus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Herodot. lib. 1. de Lydis loq. T$$ Etru&s;eans were likewi&s;e a colony from Lydia.</NOTE>, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by tha$ token, and unknown characters, re&s;embling the Erru&s;ean, to this day. So that it would ap|pear that not only Greece, but Italy, was in|debted to the Lydians for the tradition, if no$ the invention, of coinage.</P>
<P>The pieces of Servius Tullius would &s;eem to have been divided into two &s;izes; the <HI>dupondius,</HI> or piece of two pounds weight; and the <HI>libella,</HI> or that weighing one pound. The term <HI>aes,</HI> or <HI>as,</HI> &s;eems to have been indi&s;criminately ap|plied to both, and indeed with no impropriety, &s;ignifying merely <HI>a piece of bra&s;s:</HI> but at length it was confined to the latter, the coinage of the former having totally cea&s;ed, after a very &s;hort duration, abridged by its weight and unwieldy inconvenience; circum&s;tances but too eminent even in the &s;maller denomination.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of time the impre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>as</HI> was changed to that of a bu&s;t of Janus, upon the front, and the prow of a &s;hip on the rever&s;e; and, for the more general utility, pieces of inferior weight and value were coined. They bore a relative and a&s;certained value to the parent coin: the <HI>&s;emis</HI> being half the <HI>as;</HI> the <HI>triens,</HI> a third part; the <HI>quadrans,</HI> a fourth
<PB N="119" REF="159">part; and the <HI>&s;extans,</HI> a &s;ixth. While the <HI>as</HI> continued a pound weight, the&s;e parts con&s;e|quently contained proportional ounces, the Roman pound always con&s;i&s;ting of twelve; and the ounce of &s;even denarii, as the Grecian of eight drachms. But the Romans, being much reduced by the Punic wars, and other public calamities, were obliged to lower the &s;ize of their coin &s;o much that the <HI>as</HI> fell down to the weight of one ounce, and its divi&s;ions in proportion. They continued in this &s;tate till about the reign of Gallus, when the <HI>as,</HI> or large&s;t bra&s;s coin, appears again to have been lowered one half in &s;ize; for, after that period, the middle bra&s;s, or what was e&s;teemed the <HI>&s;emis</HI> in former times, occurs in the u&s;ual proportion of the large bra&s;s of the preceding reigns; and this la&s;t is &s;o very unfrequent that it cla&s;&s;es with medallions.</P>
<P>The con&s;ular bra&s;s coins of Rome are not &s;o intere&s;ting as tho&s;e of &s;ilver, but, in return, the imperial &s;eries of large bra&s;s is the mo&s;t im|portant of all the Roman coinage. The &s;mall bra&s;s medals are rare of the early emperors, and the large and middle bra&s;s of the latter.</P>
<P>This article mu&s;t not be left without ob|&s;erving that the notorious <HI>&s;pintriae</HI> of Tiberius, &s;ome of the mo&s;t infamous monuments of vice which any art has produced, cla&s;s with the
<PB N="120" REF="160">&s;mall bra&s;s coins of the early princes. They have no obver&s;e, but the Roman numerals I. II. III. &amp;c. in&s;cribed in the center: the re|ver&s;es&mdash;but I blu&s;h for the degradation of human nature.</P>
<P>Having treated, in &s;uch limits as our work will allow, of the earlie&s;t, being the bra&s;s, coinage of Rome, let us proceed to the next in point of antiquity, namely that of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Pliny tells us it was about the 485th year of Rome, that is, about 300 years after the fir&s;t bra&s;s coinage, and 266 before the Chri&s;tian period, that the fir&s;t &s;ilver i&s;&s;ued from the Ro|man mint. The denarius was the fir&s;t and la&s;t principal form which it a&s;&s;umed, for the other &s;izes are &s;o very &s;carce that it is clear few were ever &s;truck. This was at fir&s;t &s;tamped with a head of Rome in front, and x., or a &s;tar, to mark that it was worth ten a&s;es; and upon the rever&s;e bore Ca&s;tor and Pollux on hor&s;eback, or a chariot of victory. Afterwards the bu&s;ts of different deities were given on the obver&s;e; and, in proce&s;s of time, about the &s;eventh century of Rome, tho&s;e of illu&s;trious men, &s;uch as Ancus Martius, Numa, and others, who&s;e deaths had long &s;ecured their virtues from envy. But, till the age of Julius, a century after, no portrait of a living per&s;onage appears upon any Roman medal: Cae&s;ar was indeed the very
<PB N="121" REF="161">fir&s;t who a&s;&s;umed that high honour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dio, lib. XI. IV.</NOTE>. A good judge<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De la Ba&s;tie, in his notes to the la&s;t edition of La Science des Medailles, 1739.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, that there is very &s;mall dif|ference in the workman&s;hip of the be&s;t and wor&s;t &s;ilver con&s;ular coins upon which illu&s;|trious names occur: this leads him to think, that the plan of engraving on coins the names of great men and magi&s;trates, was only intro|duced about the time of Marius and Sylla.</P>
<P>The rever&s;es of the &s;ilver con&s;ular medals are fraught with much erudition and curio&s;ity. We frequently find remarkable actions, and other matters, repre&s;ented on them in no mean ta&s;te. Thus on a coin of the family of Aemi|lia, with this legend, M. LEPIDVS PONT. MAX. TVTOR REGIS, Lepidus appears in the dre&s;s of a con&s;ul, and puts the crown upon the head of young Ptolemy, whom his father had left to the tutorage of the Roman people. On the obver&s;e is the turreted head of the city Alex|andria in Egypt, with ALEXANDREA. So, in the &s;ame family, there is a medal, with a youth on hor&s;eback carrying a trophy, with this le|gend, M. LEPIDVS ANNORVM XV. PRAETEXTA|TVS HOSTEM OCCIDIT CIVEM SERVAVIT. Many other in&s;tances might be given of the curio&s;ity and importance of con&s;ular medals in &s;ilver,
<PB N="122" REF="162">but I ha&s;ten to &s;peak a little of the imperia &s;eries in this metal, after ju&s;t hinting that, b$ con&s;ular coins, medalli&s;ts only imply tho$ &s;truck by the curators, and afterwards by th$ triumviri of the money, during the time of th$ con&s;uls, until Julius a&s;&s;umed the &s;uprem$ power. The names upon this &s;uite, from which complete catalogues of the Roman illu&s;trious families have been arranged, are always tho&s;e of the curators, or triumviri, at the time, and of illu&s;trious per&s;ons ance&s;tors of their &s;everal families. So many of the&s;e names occur, tha$ it is evident the office was annual till after th$ time of Augu&s;tus; but whether it continued $word$ or not, we have no proof.</P>
<P>The &s;equence of imperial denarii is the lea&s;$ intere&s;ting of any &s;ave the gold. The device$ are almo&s;t always repeated, and to more advan|tage, upon the large and middle bra&s;s. A &s;eries of this metal may be formed at le&s;s ex|pence than any other, there not being above five emperors who are &s;carce, Pertinax, Didius Julianus, Pe&s;cennius Niger, and the Gordian$ Africani.</P>
<P>Gold was fir&s;t coined at Rome 62 years after the application of the mint to &s;ilver. The con&s;ular coins, who&s;e number is e&s;timated a$ 400 in bra&s;s and 1000 in &s;ilver, extend not to above 100 in gold, whereof, if we except the beautiful Pompey with his &s;ons on the rever&s;e,
<PB N="123" REF="163">and the Brutus with his brother Lucius, com|monly cla&s;&s;ed with imperial coins, tho the &s;pirit of the&s;e per&s;onages &s;hould rank them with the con&s;ular, few are of much di&s;tinction. Some, however, are uncommon, and of high price.</P>
<P>The gold imperial &s;eries is by far the lea&s;t intere&s;ting of any, owing to the rever&s;es varying as little from the bra&s;s as tho&s;e of the &s;ilver, and there being infinitely fewer of the gold than of the latter metal: there not being above 3000 various coins in gold, while the &s;ilver may ex|tend to 9000.</P>
<P>It is a &s;triking circum&s;tance, with regard to the Roman coins, to remark how much they are &s;pread thro all parts of the empire, even to the mo&s;t remote corners. The number found in all the countries where the Roman arms penetrated is amazing. It was, no doubt, a cu&s;|tom with that people, in every in&s;tance ardently de&s;irous of fame, to bury parcels of their coin, as a monument of their having, as it were, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground. Pa&s;&s;ing, as without certain foundation, the account of a bra&s;s medal of Augu&s;tus being found in the gold mines at Bra&s;il, and &s;ent by the arch|bi&s;hop of that province to the Pope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maurinus Siculus.</NOTE>; we know that Roman coins have been found in the Orkneys, where we &s;hould not other|wi&s;e
<PB N="124" REF="164">have known that any Roman had been; tho it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome barbaric pirate brought them there from a robbery. Roman coins have likewi&s;e been found in numbers in other the mo&s;t remote parts of Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, at that time di&s;covered. For the quantity found in the central provinces, the want of banks for money, which obliged indi|viduals to bury their ca&s;h for &s;ecurity, and other circum&s;tances of the Roman polity, not ne|ce&s;&s;ary here to dilate, mu&s;t alone account.</P>

<P>HAVING treated, at &s;uch length as the de&s;ign will permit, of the coins of the two principal languages of antiquity, it remains to mention tho&s;e of the others. This &s;hall be done with much brevity, as &s;uch coins are un|important, and of little or no worth.</P>
<P>It may be premi&s;ed, that, by ANCIENT coins, all preceding the ninth century, or age of Charlemagne, are meant: and by MODERN, all po&s;terior to that period.</P>
<P>Taking the &s;ubjects of this &s;ection in a kind of chronological order, the fir&s;t place will be due to the remote coins of Per&s;ia, with the bu&s;t of a king upon one &s;ide, and an archer, mo&s;t commonly, upon the other. The ancient joke
<PB N="126" REF="166">upon Age&s;ilaus is well known, who was force$ to retire from the Per&s;ian dominions by the bri|bery u&s;ed by the barbaric king to in&s;tigate the enemies of Sparta; namely, that he was de|feated by the <HI>archers</HI> of Per&s;ia.

The bu&s;ts of them bear perfect &s;imilarity, in point of dre&s;s, to the Kings who&s;e figures appear on the ruins of Per&s;epolis; and a near re&s;emblance to the Ar&s;acidae, who&s;e coins we have, in|&s;cribed with Greek legends.</P>
<P>The Hebrew &s;hekels, which are of &s;ilver, and about the value of the Greek tetradrachm; and bra&s;s coins, with Samaritan characters; would have been named fir&s;t, were not all of them later than the Chri&s;tian aera, and mo&s;t of them the fabrications of modern Jews. At any rate, the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion of a &s;prig on one &s;ide, and a va&s;e upon the other, runs thro all the coins of that barbarous nation; and the ad|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="127" REF="167">of but one of them is rightly e&s;teemed to be almo&s;t a di&s;grace to a cabinet.</P>
<P>The ancient Arabian coins appear in the &s;ingular &s;hape of a fi&s;h-hook. Such as I have &s;een are of &s;ilver, and the more modern have Arabic in&s;criptions.</P>
<P>The Punic coins, and the Etru&s;can, ought perhaps, in point of time, to precede the Ara|bic. The former are a&s;cribed to Phoenicea, and to Carthage; but Punic characters fre|quently occur on Sicilian coins of cities; on tho&s;e of the elder Juba king of Mauritania; and others. No probable alphabet, or interpre|tation, has yet been given of this language, tho attempts have been made, and a whole &s;cene of Plautus in that tongue exi&s;ts to conduct re|&s;earches. The Etru&s;can character nearly re|&s;embles the Punic; and exi&s;ts upon coins &s;truck by the cities, it is thought, engaged in the grand foederal war again&s;t Rome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About 112 years before the Chri&s;tian period.</NOTE>. Other me|dals and in&s;criptions are likewi&s;e found with Etru&s;can characters; but the language remains unknown<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dutens &s;eems to have given the be&s;t idea of it in his <HI>Me|$$illes Greques et Phaeniciennes,</HI> London, 1775, 4to.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nearly allied to the Punic are tho&s;e coins not uncommonly found in Spain, and by the Spa|ni&s;h writers termed <HI>medallas de&s;conocidas,</HI> "un|known medals." Some of them, it is likely,
<PB N="128" REF="168">were &s;truck by the Carthaginian colonies i$ Spain; and others by the early Spani&s;h king and petty princes. Many of them have been publi&s;hed &s;o long ago as the middle of the la&s;t century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mu&s;co de las Medallas de&s;conocidas E&s;panolas, par Don Vinc. Juan Dela&s;tonola. Hue&s;ca, 1645, 4to.</NOTE>; and &s;ome Spani&s;h writers have at tempted to explain them without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Runic is another unknown language which occurs on a very few of the earlie&s;t northern coins; and a treati&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nicolai Kede$i Runae in Nummis vetu&s;tis, &s;eu De Nummis Runicis Commentarii.

<P>Such are the chief, if not the only, coins of antiquity which occur with unknown legends and barbaric characters. But there are a few medals with Roman legends which fall into this &s;ection: for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that, tho all coins with Greek legends are indi&s;crimi|nately termed Grecian, many with Roman cha|racters by no means rank with the Roman. This is owing to the Roman character having, &s;ince the days of Rome, &s;pread all over Europe, and continued in univer&s;al and con&s;tant u&s;e with mo&s;t nations; &s;o that the ab&s;urdity which would &s;pring from cla&s;&s;ing even the ancient coins of other kingdoms as Roman, becau&s;e
<PB N="129" REF="169">their legends are in Roman characters, is appa|rent, and mu&s;t &s;tart to every eye.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h &s;tand in the very fir&s;t rank of an|cient national medals impre&s;&s;ed with Roman characters. Mo&s;t of them yet &s;ound have CVNO upon one &s;ide, with an ear of wheat, a hor&s;e, a kind of head of Janus, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;ymbol; and often CAMV, thought the initials of Came|lodunum, called by Ptolemy Camudolanum, upon the other &s;ide, with a boar and tree, or variety of other badges. They have likewi&s;e frequently the word TASCIA upon them, not hitherto explained, tho commonly thought the name of the Moneyer. They are mo&s;tly found in copper; but &s;ome in gold, &s;ilver, and elec|trum, or a mixture of the two la&s;t. A very few have VER on the rever&s;e, thought to mean Verulamium; and other legends and in&s;crip|tions. The Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum has a very fine collection, formerly the property of Sir Robert Cotton.</P>
<P>Coins of the early potentates of Gaul and Germany are likewi&s;e found with Roman le|gends: and the reader will perceive that all the kings of France down to Charlemagne range in this divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Liuva I. and the other kings of the We&s;t Goths in Spain, likewi&s;e appear upon their coins encircled with Roman characters. Liuva I.
<PB N="130" REF="170">began his reign in the 567th year of our aera; &s;o that two hundred years, and upwards, of the Spani&s;h monarchy, fall into the period a&s;&s;igned to the coins treated of in this &s;ection.</P>
<P>Different other Gothic kings, who reigned in Italy and other countries, after the fall of the Roman empire of the we&s;t, likewi&s;e u&s;e the Roman language in their coinage. They mo&s;t commonly occur on the &s;ize of medals termed &s;mall bra&s;s; and in this way we meet with Athalaric, Theodahat, Witigez, Totila, Ba|duela, and Theias. Ateula likewi&s;e appears, whom many medalli&s;ts take to be the famous Attila; but, as others doubt of it, and a&s;cribe the&s;e coins to a German prince of the name of Ateula, the point remains dubious.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XVIII.</HI> Modern Coins and Medals.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader mu&s;t readily have ob&s;erved, that thro the whole of this work, till now, the terms Coin and Medal have been u&s;ed as &s;ynonymous; and that of Medallion applied to &s;uch productions of the mint as were not in|tended for the currency of money. But now he will plea&s;e to remark, that, in treating of modern coinage, the word Coin only is u&s;ed in &s;peaking of common ca&s;h; and that of Medal &s;upplies the place of the term Medallion. The word <HI>Medaglione,</HI> from <HI>Medaglia,</HI> &s;ignifies, in its original and proper &s;ignification, 'a large Me|dal;' as <HI>Sallone,</HI> from <HI>Salle,</HI> &s;ignifies a Salloon, or large Hall.</P>
<PB N="132" REF="172">
<P>The term Medallion is very proper in treat|ing of ancient pieces, becau&s;e their devices are &s;o various that &s;ize alone di&s;tingui&s;hes tho&s;e not meant for ca&s;h from the others: but this is not the ca&s;e with the modern; for &s;uch is the &s;tupid gothici&s;m yet predominant over the mo|dern mint, that uncommon impre&s;&s;ion, as fre|quently as &s;ize, di&s;cerns its &s;olemn from i$ common products. Medallion were therefore an improper term if applied generally to the former; and tho it might often be u&s;ed with fitne&s;s in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing particular pieces of modern coinage, yet medalli&s;ts, to &s;ave nice and un|nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinctions, have univer&s;ally adopted the more familiar appellation of Medal.</P>
<P>What are meant by MODERN Coins and Me|dals the foregoing &s;ection has explained to be all &s;truck &s;ince Charlemagne, or the commence+ment of the ninth century. It mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;trike the reader, therefore, that the theme o$ this &s;ection is &s;o va&s;t, as to be almo&s;t infinite But he mu&s;t be informed, that it is intended to &s;ay little or nothing of the &s;everal coinages o$ the different modern nations, but merely to give a few general remarks. The&s;e coinage are in fact only intere&s;ting, &s;aving in a very few in&s;tances, to their particular nations. Fo$ which rea&s;on it is propo&s;ed to di&s;play that o$ our own country at &s;uch length as this &s;ligh$ plan will permit, in the next &s;ection; leaving
<PB N="133" REF="173">the natives of other countries, and tho&s;e who are generally curious in modern coinage, to peru&s;e the be&s;t works which have been written upon the Coins and Medals of each country.</P>
<P>Modern coins, down to the revival of litera|ture in the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, are &s;o very rude, that curio&s;ity is the &s;ole induce|ment to peru&s;e them. Without dates or e|pochs they can &s;erve not one purpo&s;e of utility. The very portraits found on them are &s;o un|couth, that the human face divine is hardly di&s;cernible. The rever&s;es always bear a mo&s;t beautiful cro&s;s garni&s;hed with pellets, or a di&s;h of &s;ome &s;uch exqui&s;ite flavour. Yet &s;uch is the lu&s;t of curio&s;ity, of completing a &s;eries, or of &s;elf-love indulged in the extreme by po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing a bauble which nobody el&s;e does, that ten or twenty guineas are often given for one of the&s;e pretty little things.</P>
<P>Such might be the rigid cen&s;ure of a &s;evere judge upon this &s;ubject; but even the mo&s;t &s;evere judge mu&s;t allow, that national monu|ments, however rude, are more intere&s;ting to far the greater part of a people, than the mo&s;t perfect productions of art pertaining to another nation. And this principle is que&s;tionle&s;s as rational as it is general; for nothing can be more engaging in this way than monuments illu&s;trative of, or in the lea&s;t relating to, per|&s;ons,
<PB N="134" REF="174">or actions, in the glory whereof the com|mon pa&s;&s;ion of national vanity warmly intere&s;ts our affections. The noble of Edward III. on which he appears in a &s;hip, as a&s;&s;erting the Bri|ti&s;h dominion of the ocean, would, tho uncouth in execution, which it by no means is, ju&s;tly command our highe&s;t regard and attention: and doubtle&s;s any patriot, nay, I believe, any Briton, would, even in the&s;e days, (what days!) place mo&s;t ju&s;tly a higher value upon this coin, than upon the mo&s;t perfect medal which Gre|cian &s;kill has produced. The coins of Edward the Black Prince, and others, are alike in|tere&s;ting upon this &s;core, tho indeed the whole Engli&s;h &s;eries mu&s;t be intere&s;ting to every one intere&s;ted in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>But even what is here &s;aid, as to the intere&s;t which particular nations mu&s;t take in their own coinage, is a &s;ufficient argument for touching very lightly upon that of other countries, in order that all the room po&s;&s;ible may be re|&s;erved in this little treati&s;e for the &s;ubjects of national predilection. Indeed, if the reader has &s;een cabinets of coins, or even looked into &s;ale-catalogues, he mu&s;t know that not even kings, or the mo&s;t wealthy private collectors, ever think it worth while to form large and complete &s;erie&s;es of coins of other nations than their own. When &s;uch foreign coins occur, it is from a late period, or owing to &s;ome re|markable
<PB N="135" REF="175">circum&s;tance attending them. So we find medals of Henry IV. in cabinets which po&s;&s;e&s;s not another French coin, becau&s;e of the fame of that prince, and glory of his actions. Such being the ca&s;e, I am confident that not one of my readers will regret my clo&s;ing this &s;ection with a very few remarks.</P>
<P>Di&s;tinct &s;equences of the coins of &s;ome mo|dern &s;tates are ea&s;ily formed; of others not. Indeed it is matter of wonder that the money of &s;ome &s;mall &s;tates &s;hould &s;o much abound, while that of &s;everal very wealthy kingdoms is &s;o deficient. To give one example: the opulence of the More&s;que kingdoms in Spain is well known; yet very few of their coins are extant. Even Granada, the riche&s;t and greate&s;t of the&s;e kingdoms, nay the la&s;t conquered, pre&s;ents us but one or two &s;olitary monarchs, from Mahomad Alhamar, the fir&s;t king, in 1273, to Abo Audili, called Chico, or the Lit|tle, the la&s;t king, from whom the crown was wre&s;ted by Ferdinand king of Spain towards the clo&s;e of the fifteenth century. Yet Gra|nada was the city in which the wonderful pa|lace of Alhambra &s;tood, that va&s;t monument of barbaric wealth and art; Granada was the king|dom graced with the country palace of Alix|ares upon the river Xenil, &s;o celebrated in co|temporary writers for its a&s;toni&s;hing magnifi|cence.
<PB N="136" REF="176">All its apartments were of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing pomp, and the wealth of the king is declare$ in the payment of the architect.</P>
<Q><L>El Moro que las labrava</L>
<L>Cien doblas ganava el dia;</L>
<L>Y el dia que no las labra</L>
<L>Otras tantas &s;e perdia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toria de las Guerras civiles de Granada.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>But, allowing the&s;e ver&s;es the privilege o$ poetry, the remains of the palace called Alham|bra, are a &s;ufficient evidence of the &s;tate of the arts, and va&s;t opulence of this kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Swinburne's Travels in Spain.</NOTE>; and the&s;e arts, and that opulence, con&s;pire to ren|der the extreme &s;carcity of its coinage &s;o unac|countable. Nor let it be imagined that the Mahometan religion had any effect upon this circum&s;tance, for we have coins of fifty or &s;ixty Arabian caliphs, almo&s;t forming a &s;eries.</P>
<P>What conduces to render &s;erie&s;es of mo|dern coins very imperfect, is the great number of petty &s;tates and kingdoms, into which all the grand parts of Europe were divided, during the turbulent night of the middle ages. The Saxon heptarchies in England indeed clo&s;e at the year 801, when Egbert ro&s;e &s;ole monarch of this kingdom; exactly at the very period a&s;&s;igned to the commencement of modern coins.
<PB N="137" REF="177">Hence the &s;eries of modern Engli&s;h coins is more complete than that of any country in the world, not excepting France, tho the latter was a great monarchy, not indeed &s;o wide as at pre|&s;ent, for four centuries before. For, in the &s;eries of Engli&s;h princes, not one reign is want|ing in the coinage; whereas there are &s;everal French kings of whom no coins are found, and hardly any with portraits, till Louis XII.; an imperfection however infinitely more ap|parent in the &s;equences of every other country of no very modern name and government.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t modern MEDALS we know are tho&s;e by Pi&s;ano the painter, and by Bolduci, towards the middle of the fifteenth century. Of Bolduci nothing is known, &s;ave that his works are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the mark <HI>Opus Bolducis.</HI> Pi&s;ano was a painter of &s;ome merit for the time; whence his medals are in&s;cribed <HI>Opus Pi&s;ani pictoris.</HI> Such is that of John Emperor of Con&s;tantinople, 1439; and another of Al|phon&s;o, king of Arragon, 1448; which la&s;t oc|curs in lead, but was doubtle&s;s likewi&s;e &s;truck in more precious metals. Va&s;ari gives us a ca|talogue of the medals engraved by Pi&s;ano in his lives of the painters. A medal of the council of Florence, held in 1439, is likeways ob&s;erva|ble, and is &s;truck in gold.</P>
<P>Paul II. who was created Pope in 1464, is the fir&s;t Pontiff, who &s;truck medals with his
<PB N="138" REF="178">own portrait, as it is believed. We have in|deed Papal medals from Martin V. 1417, but all tho&s;e prior to Paul II. were engraved under the pontificate of Alexander VII. 1655, by the care and direction of Abb&eacute; Bigot, and at the expence of Cardinal Franci&s;co Barberini. Co|aeval medals of Paul II. indeed exi&s;t, but not of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, till Julius II. &s;o that the &s;eries properly begins with the latter.</P>
<P>From the pontificate of Julius II. we have many Papal medals of very fine relief and workman&s;hip; to be found indeed on tho&s;e of Leo X. his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in the highe&s;t perfec|tion. The celebrated Cellini tells us, in the very entertaining account of his own life, that he engraved different medals for Clement VII. but I know not if he put his name upon them, or left them in his pride to be known by the &s;uperiority of the performance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a fine &s;ilver medal of duke Alexander of Florence by Cellini in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum. It is much in the bold manner of the a$$$ent, without that minute fini&s;h ob&s;ervable on mo&s;t mo|dern medals, the rever&s;e is a bu&s;t of Co&s;mo II. There is like|wi&s;e a large bra&s;s medal of Pi&s;ano by him&s;elf, PISANVS PICTOR.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The arts now reviving apace, after the commencement of the &s;ixteenth century we find many medals of all the European powers. It is remarkable that, almo&s;t as &s;oon as the &s;trik|ing of medals was again brought into u&s;e, they began to be &s;atyric, a quality unknown to the
<PB N="139" REF="179">ancient mint. Julius II. having irritated Louis XII. of France, with whom he was at variance, by a &s;atyric medal, that prince retorted by his celebrated one &s;tamped in gold of two &s;izes, about the bulk of our guinea, and le&s;s, in 1512; upon the front of which is the king's bu&s;t, with his titles; and upon the rever&s;e the arms of France, by the bye a mo&s;t improper rever&s;e for the occa&s;ion, with this legend PERDAM BABILONIS NOMEN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of them, with engravings, in that amu&s;ing mi&s;cellany of fugitive Literature, the Gentleman's Magazine, 1782.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame kind, but more witty, is the medal of Henry IV. of France, retorting upon the Duke of Savoy. This prince having &s;eized upon Saluzzo. during the time that the French monarchy was rent by civil wars in 1588, &s;truck a coin, upon the rever&s;e of which a cen|taur appears carrying off a fine woman, with this legend OPPORTVNE. Henry having reconquered Saluzzo in 1603, publi&s;hed another, upon which Hercules appears killing the centaur, with the word OPPORTVNIVS.</P>
<P>Satire indeed forms a chief attribute of mo|dern medals, in&s;omuch that we may &s;afely &s;ay as many exi&s;t of this angry kind, as of almo&s;t all the others. Wit and humour are indeed qualities which may be looked upon as of mere modern growth, and there can be no
<PB N="140" REF="180">harm in their appearing on medals, as well as any where el&s;e. Medals were the vehicles of political &s;atire, till the print-&s;hops took up the trade. Had we any ancient &s;atyric pieces of this &s;ort, they would be valued more highly than any other objects of a cabinet. Witne&s;s that ancient medal, &s;u&s;pected to be &s;atyric upon Gallienus the emperor, under whom the whole empire was torn to pieces by u&s;urpers. The front bears the emperor's bu&s;t GALLIENAE AVG; the rever&s;e a figure of Peace, PAX VBIQVE. Some will have it that there was a Galliena Augu&s;ta; and that the engraver, by a mi&s;take, which &s;ometimes occurs, has put her name round the emperor's bu&s;t; and perhaps at &s;ame time in&s;cribed the name of Gallienus around a dye prepared for her. But the legend of the rever&s;e is &s;o uncommon that I remember it upon no other coin, which induces me to be decidedly of their opinion, who put this piece as &s;atyric. Be&s;ides, if it is not meant to be witty, it is only the more &s;o.</P>
<P>Many of the modern medals are &s;uperior to any ancient productions of the kind in beauty and high fini&s;h; but they commonly yield in &s;trength and relief. The Dutch have perhaps &s;truck the greate&s;t number of medals of any modern nations: and Louis XIV. of France has exceeded all modern princes in this way. But his medals, tho many an Abb&eacute; formed the de|&s;igns,
<PB N="141" REF="181">and many a petit-maitre the mottos, and tho they are likeways tolerably well engraved in a few in&s;tances, are de&s;pi&s;ed even in France $&s;elf, being indeed contemptible efforts of vain glory. The &s;eries of his medals may well be called a chain of lyes; the occa&s;ions and events being far mo&s;t generally fal&s;ified and mi&s;repre|&s;ented: and his blind flatterers converted into matters of prai&s;e actions and events of the mo&s;t ju&s;t obloquy and &s;corn, &s;uch as the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and innumerable others.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e this &s;ection, it will be proper to &s;ay &s;omething re&s;pecting a particular i&s;&s;ue of modern mints, called JETTONS, or COUNTERS. The&s;e pieces very frequently occur, and are apt to confound the un&s;kilful, who know not what to make of them. They are &s;mall, and very thin, pieces, commonly of copper or bra&s;s, tho &s;ometimes of &s;ilver, and even of gold. The latter precious metals were &s;tamped in different countries, and are &s;tamped in France to this day, for the purpo&s;e of being pre&s;ented, by pur&s;es at a time, from trading or other companies, to per&s;ons of high condition upon &s;olemn occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P>The intention of the common counters, as im|plied by both the Engli&s;h name, and the French Jetton, from <HI>Jetter</HI> to <HI>ca&s;t,</HI> whence our phra&s;e <HI>to ca&s;t up</HI> accounts, was merely for calculation.
<PB N="142" REF="182">This was performed by means of a boan$ marked with parallel lines. The bottom line was the place of units, and the &s;econd of tens each &s;uperior line multiplying ten-fold in the &s;ame manner. The operation, difficult in ap|pearance, doubtle&s;s became very ea&s;y by much practice. But, for a proper and clear detail of it, we mu&s;t refer to Mr. Snelling's u&s;eful pamphlet on Counters, commonly bound up with his works on Engli&s;h coins.</P>
<P>The&s;e pieces were of mo&s;t common u&s;e in abbeys, and other places where the revenue was complex, and of difficult adju&s;tment. For this rea&s;on a great number of them is found in the ruins of our Engli&s;h abbeys, whence they are commonly called Abbey-pieces.</P>
<P>But almo&s;t all of them are coined abroad; and that from the fourteenth century down to the pre&s;ent times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">French jettons exi&s;t from Philip VI. 1328.</NOTE>: tho &s;ome few have likewi&s;e been &s;truck in England, from the time of Henry VIII. downwards.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the gold and &s;ilver counters are within the pre&s;ent century, and &s;truck in France. They are &s;o readily known from the arms of the companies on them, and other marks, that it is needle&s;s to dwell on them. The Engli&s;h <HI>touch-pieces</HI> may be cla&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="143" REF="183">&s;ilver counters: they commonly bear St. Mi|chael and the Dragon on one &s;ide, and a &s;hip on the other; and were de&s;igned to be hung round the neck when the king touched the party for the evil: the late&s;t are of James II.</P>
<P>The ancient copper counters are the mo&s;t ready to impo&s;e upon a beginner, who is apt to pay for them as coins, tho they are not worth a penny a piece. For which rea&s;on it will be pro|per to give him &s;ome marks to di&s;cern them. In Mr. Snelling's treati&s;e he will find plates of them of all ages, whereby he will more &s;urely judge of their devices than by any other method. He will there perceive that the mo&s;t ancient have cro&s;&s;es with pellets upon both &s;ides, and &s;imilar devices; the next, globes &s;urmounted by cro&s;&s;es, &amp;c. and the mo&s;t modern portraits of princes and dates, with the arms of the kingdoms on the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>They are be&s;ides ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by their thinne&s;s, which degrades them from all other coin: for as medals are &s;uperior to coin, &s;o counters of all kinds are inferior. The ancient ones can impo&s;e upon nobody, for copper was not coined for currency in France, and other countries where they are principally &s;truck, till about 1580; and bra&s;s never was common coin of any &s;tate in modern times. The modern have almo&s;t always a legend in Latin, French,
<PB N="144" REF="184">or Flemi&s;h, which marks their intention; being &s;o many maxims of ju&s;tice in accompts; or le|gends declarative of their u&s;e, as for accompt|ing in the French king's wardrobe, his exche|quer, or other offices. Tho&s;e with Dutch, Fle|mi&s;h, or German legends are more apt to de|ceive, becau&s;e nobody under&s;tands the lan|guage; but if the reader lays it down as a ge|neral rule that not a coin with the&s;e languages is worth a farthing, he will not be in the wrong.</P>
<P>Some people are &s;o puerile as to allow the&s;e baubles a place in a cabinet, while the true judge ranks them with tho&s;e other counters, of indeed the very &s;ame value, which every toy|man &s;ells to children.

<P>The coins of the Saxon heptarchies might have been treated in the &s;ection intitled <HI>Coins of other ancient nations,</HI> for they are pre|vious to the period a&s;&s;igned for the appellation of modern. But, to pre&s;ent a regular view of
<PB N="147" REF="187">Engli&s;h coinage, it was more proper that they &s;hould come in here.</P>
<P>A few coins &s;uppo&s;ed to be Anglo-&s;axon, or of Saxon kings in England, have been found in gold. But they are almo&s;t univer&s;ally &s;ilver, and of the ancient penny &s;ize and weight. A number of in&s;ignificant pieces of copper, called Stycas, likewi&s;e occur: they are worth about half a farthing, and were only coined in the kingdom of Northumberland towards its termi|nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e Saxon pennies, which have unintelli|gible, or no, legends, are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the mo&s;t ancient; and &s;uch are now termed &s;keats, from the Saxon Sceatta, the name of a coin, twenty of which at fir&s;t went to a &s;hilling; but afterwards they were rai&s;ed to the penny weight, and only five went to the &s;hilling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clarke's Connexion of the Roman, Saxon, and Engli&s;h coins. London, 1767. 4to.</NOTE>. Mr. Clarke likewi&s;e contends that Saxon &s;hillings worth five ancient pennies, about fifteen pence of our money, and Thrim&s;as of three pennies, were actual, and not ideal, coins; but none &s;uch have yet been found.</P>
<P>Saxon pennies appear of many of the hep|tarchic princes; &s;uch as Cuthred and Athel&s;tan of Kent: Eothbert, Sihtric, Anlaff, of Northum|berland, the two latter likeways kings of Ire|land:
<PB N="148" REF="188">Ethelweard of the We&s;t Saxons: Eori$ of the Ea&s;t-Angles: Offa of Mercia, and Quin$ red his queen; with Kenwulf, Wiglaff, Bent$ wulf, Bughred, and Ceolwulf, all kings o$ Mercia: be&s;ides the archbi&s;hops Wlfred and Ciulnoth. And pennies of the kings of all Eng|land are known from Egbert, the fir&s;t &s;ole mo|narch.</P>
<P>The &s;eries of Engli&s;h pennies extends there|fore without any failure from Egbert the fir&s;t king to the pre&s;ent reign; and will, in all pro|bability, to the end of time. It is already, $word$ we except a gradual diminution of &s;ize owing to the encrea&s;ing value of &s;ilver, the mo&s;t uni|form, and, without doubt, the mo&s;t lengthened, &s;equence of one &s;pecies of coins in the world. The Roman denarii extend not, for a certainty, beyond 500 years; but this has already attain|ed very near 1000. The Reverend Mr. South|gate, who, to his many virtues, adds the infe|rior prai&s;e of an eminent &s;kill in medals, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es, in his cho&s;en cabinet, the mo&s;t neat and complete &s;eries of this kind perhaps to be found.

<P>The fir&s;t Engli&s;h pennies weigh 22&frac12; grains Troy, though one would judge, from our term penny-weight, that they primarily weighed 24 grains, which go to our pre&s;ent weight of that denomination. Towards the clo&s;e of Ed|ward III. the penny weighs but 18 grains, and in the reign of Edward IV. it fell to 12, after previou&s;ly &s;inking to 15. In Edward the Sixth's time, 1551, the penny was reduced to 8 grains, and after the 43d of Elizabeth to 7 23/31 grains; at which weight it continues to this day.

<P>Having thus given a brief view of the Eng|li&s;h &s;ilver coinage, I &s;hall offer a few mi&s;cella|neous ob&s;ervations, ere I proceed to the gold; and &s;hall begin with ob&s;erving, that the whole coinage of this country, and the &s;ilver among the re&s;t, have generally been of the fir&s;t purity. At two or three particular periods, however, deba&s;ements of a &s;hort date have taken place. The captivity of Richard I. and the immen&s;e ran&s;om paid to the Emperor Henry VI. for his redemption, mu&s;t have much impoveri&s;hed the kingdom. The ran&s;om amounted to 100,000 marks, which, at 13<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> a mark, makes 1,600,000 pennies, then the only coin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some writers &s;ay 150,000 marks of Cologn &s;ilver, which much enhances the argument.</NOTE>: a va&s;t &s;um in the currency of tho&s;e days, and which prevents our wonder at but one or two Engli&s;h pennies of Richard, and none of John, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, being to be found; tho a dozen or more of Richard's pennies, &s;truck in France<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Engli&s;h coins &s;truck in France have, however, no po$traits, &s;ave the pennies of William I, till the reign of Edward III.</NOTE>, are known, and tho&s;e of John, coined in Ireland, are not &s;o rare. Yet we find not that any degradation, or diminution of the coin took place in con&s;equence of this calamitous event, tho there is no doubt but the public poverty gave ri&s;e to much of the happy ferment
<PB N="152" REF="192">in John's time; and perhaps we may pronounce that it is to the captivity of Richard that we are indebted for our freedom.</P>
<P>Henry VIII. was the fir&s;t prince who deba&s;ed the public money; and it was a deba&s;ement in|deed! for it extended to 91 per cent. All his full-faced money, with a few exceptions, is of this de&s;cription; and his &s;ide-faced, or fir&s;t coined, is good. The rever&s;e is the ca&s;e with that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Edward VI. who&s;e &s;ide-faced is bad, as fir&s;t coined, and his full-faced good, being al&s;o the la&s;t full-face upon Engli&s;h coin. Edward's ba&s;e coin of 1547 is the very fir&s;t Engli&s;h money bearing a date. In 1552 the &s;ilver coin was re&s;tored to the old &s;tandard, and ever &s;ince the 43d year of Elizabeth, 1601, it has &s;tood at 18 penny-weights alloy in the pound weight.</P>
<P>However, the &s;ilver, in William the Third's time, was &s;o prodigiou&s;ly dimini&s;hed by clip|ping, and other infamous arts, that, in 1696, the guinea ro&s;e in its value to thirty &s;hillings of &s;uch &s;ilver currency as then was. The diminu|tion of the &s;ilver had gradually rai&s;ed the value of the gold from 1688, when the guinea was at 21<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>d,</HI></ABBR> till 1696, when at 30<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> This was principally owing to the common circulation of the old hammered &s;ilver coin, very broad and thin, and con&s;equently very liable to clipping and other injuries. By Act of Parliament all
<PB N="153" REF="193">the former &s;ilver was brought in; and in 1696 that which is called The Grand Recoinage of Silver took place, amounting to upwards of 6,400,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> &s;terling. For the more expedition country mints were e&s;tabli&s;hed at Bri&s;tol, Che&s;|ter, Exeter, Norwich, and York; the pieces there &s;truck have the fir&s;t letter of the&s;e names under the bu&s;t of the king; and to this Grand Recoinage it is owing that the &s;ilver of Wil|liam III. is &s;o very common.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, however, the &s;ilver of this kingdom is very near as bad as before the Grand Recoinage; for the Birmingham arti&s;ts gain very much by fabricating current coins, even of good &s;ilver, our &s;hillings not being worth above nine pence, and the re&s;t in propor|tion. This calls aloud for parliamentary inter|po&s;ition, were not all the powers and u&s;es of parliament, at this di&s;mal period, utterly anni|hilated by party. When the Duke of North|umberland went lord lieutenant to Ireland, in 1763, one hundred pounds worth of the pre&s;ent king's &s;hillings were &s;truck; and three other trials have been made at the Tower, the late&s;t 1778: but a &s;ilver coinage, tho wanted in the highe&s;t degree, &s;eems never yet to have been tho ught of.</P>
<P>The GOLD coinage, as the next in antiquity, mu&s;t claim our &s;econd attention. About 1257 Henry III. formed the de&s;ign of a gold coinage,
<PB N="154" REF="194">and ordered it to be current in the kingdom; but it mu&s;t have been very confined, as only one &s;pecimen of it has reached us, at lea&s;t the coin is hitherto unique. It is called a gold penny, of about the &s;ize of a &s;ilver one, and is not of bad execution for the time, as may be judged from a print of it in Snelling's View of the Gold Coin, copied in Folkes's Tables of the la&s;t edition.</P>
<P>But it is from Edward III. that the &s;eries of gold coinage commences, for no more occurs till 1344, when that prince fir&s;t &s;truck Florens, &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o called from the be&s;t gold then coined at Florence, a &s;tate where the fine arts began faintly to dawn. The floren was then worth &s;ix &s;hillings, but is now intrin&s;ically worth nineteen, from the increa&s;ed value of gold, and diminution of &s;ilver coins. The half and quarter of the floren were &s;truck at the &s;ame time; and it is needle&s;s to add that they were of proportional value.</P>
<P>This coin being rather inconvenient, as form|ing no di&s;tinct and articulate portion of larger ideal denominations, in the &s;ame year the Noble was made public, of 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> value, and con&s;e|quently forming half a mark, then the mo&s;t ge|neral ideal mode of money. It was &s;o termed from the nobility of the metal, being of the fine&s;t gold then, or now, u&s;ed in the world for coinage, and was attended by its half and quar|ter:
<PB N="155" REF="195">the proportion of &s;ilver to gold being then 1 to 11. This coin, &s;ometimes called the Ro&s;e Noble, from both &s;ides being impaled in an undulating circle, re&s;embling the outline of an expanded ro&s;e, together with its half and quarter, continued the only gold coins till the Angels of Henry VI, 1422, &s;tamped with the Angel Michael and the Dragon, and the Ange|lets, equal to half the Angel, or 3<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> were &s;ub&s;tituted in their place. Antiquaries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leake, in his Hi&s;torical Account of Engli&s;h Money, and others.</NOTE> like|wi&s;e a&s;&s;ert, that gold being &s;carce in Henry the Fifth's time, that prince dimini&s;hed the noble, retaining its former value; but that Henry VI. re&s;tored it to its &s;ize, and cau&s;ed it to pa&s;s for 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> under the new name of Ryal. According|ly, the noble of Henry V. weighs only 107 grains now, while tho&s;e preceding his reign weigh 118. This &s;peaks gold to have increa&s;ed in value about 10 per cent. The old noble of Edward III. and Richard II, at 118 grains, pa&s;&s;ed but for 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>; but in the 49th year of Henry VI, 1461, the angel was of equal value, tho but 80 grains in weight; which &s;hews gold to have increa&s;ed in value then no le&s;s than 30 per cent. Certain it is that the ryal of 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> and the angel of 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> with their divi&s;ions of half and quarter, were the &s;ole gold coins till, in 1485,

The gold crown of Henry VIII. is about the &s;ize of our &s;hilling, and the half crown of a &s;ixpence, but thin, as all hammered money was in modern times.</P>
<P>The&s;e coins continued, with a few variations, till Charles II. e&s;tabli&s;hed the pre&s;ent &s;orts of gold coin; but &s;ome remarks upon the&s;e varia|tions, and other matters connected with this point, it will be proper to give.</P>
<P>Edward VI., upon a&s;&s;uming the &s;cepter, found the coin in a &s;tate of deba&s;ement, to which none, but that frantic tyrant his father, would have dared to reduce it. The gold of
<PB N="157" REF="197">his la&s;t year being of 20 carats fine and 2 alloy; and the &s;ilver of 4 ounces fine and &mdash; 8 ounces alloy in the pound of 12 ounces! With much labour the gold coin was in 1551 re&s;tored by Edward VI. to its old &s;tandard, after one coinage of 22 carats fine, 2 alloy, which was a proportion occa&s;ionally admitted into our gold coin after Henry VIII. till a very late period, it is believed the reign of George I.</P>
<P>Till Edward VI. our monarchs appear upon their gold coin at full, or three quarters, length; that prince was the fir&s;t who&s;e bu&s;t only is &s;een. Silver, which had been to gold for &s;ome time as 1 to 4, was again reduced in 1551 to its old proportion of 1 to 11.</P>
<P>Upon the union of the crowns, James I. of England gave the &s;overeign the name of unite, it being then of 20<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> value. Of him are like|wi&s;e ro&s;e ryals of 30<ABBR><HI>s.,</HI></ABBR> and &s;pur ryals of 15<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR>; angels of 10<ABBR><HI>s.,</HI></ABBR> and angelets of 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR>; till his ninth year, when gold was rai&s;ed in the pro|portion of 1<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> in 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Silver, which had fallen in its proportion from gold to the degree of 1 to 12, now &s;unk further as 1 to 13 &frac12; in weight. The gold crown, and half crown continued to this prince inclu&s;ive, and the crown to his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign, which had been likewi&s;e commonly termed the broad piece, under the
<PB N="158" REF="198">common-wealth a&s;&s;umed the uninvidious name of the twenty &s;hilling piece, which it retained till &s;upplanted by that of the guinea. The common-wealth likewi&s;e &s;truck ten &s;hilling and five &s;hilling pieces in gold. Oliver publi&s;hed none but twenty &s;hilling pieces, and very few even of the&s;e.</P>
<P>The guinea, &s;o called from the Guinea gold out of which it was fir&s;t &s;truck, was proclaimed in 1663, and to go for 20<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> But it never went for le&s;s than 21<ABBR>s,</ABBR> by tacit and univer&s;al con|&s;ent. Charles II. likewi&s;e i&s;&s;ued half-guineas, double guineas, and five guinea pieces, which have been all continued thro every reign to this day; tho the latter two are not in common circulation. George I. publi&s;hed quarter-gui|neas, an example imitated by his pre&s;ent ma|je&s;ty; but the&s;e la&s;t of George III. were found &s;o trouble&s;ome, and apt to be lo&s;t, that they were &s;topped within a year or two when re|ceived at the Bank of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is computed that the whole ca&s;h of the kingdoms pa&s;&s;es thro the Bank of England once in three years.</NOTE>, and thus &s;i|lently annihilated.

Money of <HI>billon</HI> was com|mon in all France from about the year 1200. <HI>Hardies,</HI> being authori&s;ed black-money, of Edward the Black Prince, are likewi&s;e found.</NOTE>, with a few &s;mall exceptions after the time of Elizabeth, we need not much wonder that, in more remote periods, its deficiency was not at all felt.</P>
<P>The known aver&s;ion of that illu&s;trious queen, and of the nation in general, to a copper coin|age, the la&s;t &s;hewn in a particular manner in the in&s;tance of the farthing-tokens of James I. pre&s;ently to be mentioned, has not been ex|plained by our medallic writers, who, if they explain a legend, think they have done all their duty. It was owing to the counterfeit money, called <HI>black money,</HI> being always of copper mixed or wa&s;hed with about a fifth part &s;ilver. The term of black money evidently aro&s;e from contradi&s;tinction to <HI>white money,</HI> yet a name for that of pure &s;ilver, which it was made to imi|tate. When it is con&s;idered, therefore, that the ba&s;e money was always of copper, it is no wonder that the idea of a copper coinage &s;hould be confounded with that of an impo&s;ition of authori&s;ed bad money.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="202">
<P>Edward VI. was the la&s;t prince under whom farthings could po&s;&s;ibly be coined of &s;ilver, the metal being &s;o increa&s;ed in its value; and tho it is known from records that he did coin farthings, not one of them is to be found. The &s;mallne&s;s indeed even of the &s;ilver half-penny, though continued down to the com|mon-wealth, was of extreme inconvenience; for a dozen of them might be in a man's pocket, and yet not be di&s;covered without a good mag|nifying gla&s;s. Hence in Elizabeth's time, there being no &s;tate-farthings, &s;ome cities, as Bri&s;tol, Oxford, and Worce&s;ter, &s;truck farthings, which were confined to the u&s;e of their re&s;pective in habitants, till called in by government in 1594 Be&s;ides the&s;e cities, near 3000 trade&s;men and others coined tokens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Cotton's Po&s;thuma, 1679, 12mo. p. 199.</NOTE>; upon returning which to the i&s;&s;uer, he gave current coin, or value, for them as de&s;ired.</P>
<P>In 1594 this practice had got to a great length and government had &s;erious thoughts of a cop|per coinage; for now, as would appear, $ &s;mall copper coin was &s;truck, of about the &s;iz$ of a &s;ilver two-pence, with the queen's mono+gram upon one &s;ide, and a ro&s;e on the other; the running legend of both &s;ides being TH$ PLEDGE OF&mdash;A HALF PENNY. Patterns of this occur both in copper, and in &s;ilver, but the
<PB N="163" REF="203">queen not being able to re&s;ign her fixt aver&s;ion to copper coinage, the &s;cheme fell to the ground.</P>
<P>It was not revived till the &s;ucceding reign, when, upon the 19th May, 1613, King James's Royal farthing tokens commenced by proclama|tion. They are mo&s;tly of the &s;ame &s;ize with the above, and have upon one &s;ide two &s;cepters in &s;altier, &s;urmounted with a crown, and the harp upon the other, as would &s;eem with intention that if the Engli&s;h refu&s;ed them currency, as was ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected, they might be ordered to pa&s;s in Ireland. For they were not forced upon the people in the light of farthings, or e&s;ta|bli&s;hed coin, but merely as pledges or tokens, for which government was obliged to give other coin if required. Their legend is the king's common titles running upon each &s;ide.</P>
<P>The&s;e pieces were by no means favourably received, but continued in a kind of reluctant circulation all this reign, and the beginning of the &s;ucceeding. In 1635, Charles I. &s;truck tho&s;e with the ro&s;e in&s;tead of the harp. The va&s;t number of counterfeits, and the king's death in 1648, put an utter &s;$$p to their cur|rency; and the tokens of towns and trade&s;men again took their run, increa&s;ing prodig$ou&s;ly till 1672, when farthings properly &s;o called were fir&s;t publi&s;hed by government.</P>
<PB N="164" REF="204">
<P>The&s;e town pieces and trade&s;mens' tokens, together with them of the time of Elizabeth, are collected by &s;ome antiquaries with an avi|dity truly puerile. For I will venture to &s;ay, that their workman&s;hip is always utterly contemp|tible, and that not one purpo&s;e of ta&s;te, infor|mation, or curio&s;ity, can be drawn from them. It need hardly be added that they are re|commended to the &s;upreme &s;corn of the reader, who may ju&s;tly regard the &s;tudying or collect|ing of them, along with the admiration of counters, as beneath any man of common &s;en&s;e. This madne&s;s, one of the &s;trange&s;t that ever creeped into the confines of any &s;cience, was prophecied in a &s;ingular manner by Evelyn in his work on medals; for which rea&s;on his words are here laid before the reader. Speak|ing of the Attic &s;mall copper coins, he &s;ays, <Q>&startq;Hardly half as large as the tokens, which every tavern and tippling-hou&s;e in the days of &endq;late anarchy among us</Q> (he knew not that they were as frequent in the glorious reign of Elizabeth) <Q>pre&s;umed to &s;tamp, and utter &startq;for immediate exchange; as they were pa&s;&s;a|ble through the neighbourhood. Which, though &s;eldom reaching further than the next &s;treet or two, may haply in after-times come to exerci&s;e and bu&s;y the learned what they &s;hould &s;ignify, and fill whole volumes with conjectures, as I am per&s;uaded &s;everal as ar|rant
<PB N="165" REF="205">&endq;trifles have done.</Q> Similar tokens are to this day current in Scotland, both of cop|per and tin, principally i&s;&s;ued by the bakers and grocers; farthings not being very common in that country.</P>
<P>Government however had now frequent ideas of improving the copper coinage, for many pattern pieces for farthings occur. So early as 1640 one ari&s;es, upon one &s;ide of which the legend is FARTHING TOAKENS, and upon the other TYPVS MONETAE ANG. AERIS; thought to be the work of Briot, as re&s;embling his pat|tern &s;hilling. Tryal farthings of the common-wealth likewi&s;e appear with various types and legends: tho&s;e of Oliver have his bu&s;t with different rever&s;es, and one of his bears the &s;in|gular date of 1651, if Snelling does not mi&s;|lead me, when he was not protector till 1653. Of Charles II. many pattern farthings are known ere 1672, when they and half-pence were fir&s;t made public money: of which the mo&s;t remarkable is that with the king's bu&s;t, CAROLVS A CAROLO, and the rever&s;e of Bri|tannia as in the pre&s;ent, with QVATVOR MARIA VINDICO. The&s;e were fir&s;t &s;truck in 1665, and mo&s;t commonly occur in &s;ilver; whence the copper are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t precious. None of them ever were in circulation, tho we meet with a few impre&s;&s;ions both in &s;ilver and cop|per, dated 1676, thrown off, I &s;uppo&s;e, by the
<PB N="166" REF="206">engraver, to oblige his friends. The half-pence of this legend are more common in copper than in &s;ilver.</P>
<P>In 1670 current half-pence and farthings fir&s;t began to be &s;truck at the Tower, but they were not proclaimed till 16th Augu&s;t 1672. They were of pure Swedi&s;h copper, and the die were engraved by Roettier. The&s;e conti|nued till the la&s;t of Charles II. 1684, when &s;ome di&s;putes ari&s;ing about the copper, latterly had from Engli&s;h mines, tin farthings were coine$ with a &s;tud of copper in the center, and in|&s;cribed round the edge, as the crown-pieces with NVMMORVM FAMVLVS, 1685, or 1686. Half-pence of the &s;ame kind were i&s;&s;ued the year after, 1685, and tin continued to be coined til$ 1692, to the value of upwards of 65,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> I$ 1693 the tin was all called in, and the copper coinage commenced anew.</P>
<P>All the farthings of the following reign o$ Ann are tryal-pieces, &s;ave that of 1714, her la&s;t year. They are of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite work+man&s;hip, exceeding any copper coins of ancien$ or of modern times, and will do honour to th$ engraver, Mr. Croker, to the end of time. Th$ one who&s;e rever&s;e is peace in a car, PAX MISS$ PER O$B$M, is the mo&s;t e&s;teemed, and next t$ it the Britannia under a portal. The other far+things, and the half-pence, are not &s;o valu|able.</P>
<PB N="167" REF="207">
<P>Before this brief account of the copper coin|age is clo&s;ed, I mu&s;t beg leave to make one ob|&s;ervation upon a mo&s;t material defect in it, which is, that the intrin&s;ic worth of the metal is not one half of its currency. The pound of copper, which in it&s;elf is only worth ten pence, yields forty-&s;ix half-pence, or twenty-three pence when coined. Hence forgeries even in good metal are of very high profit, and the whole kingdom &s;warms with counterfeit copper, in&s;omuch that not the fiftieth part of that cur|rency is legitimate; a di&s;grace to the annals, and the legi&s;lature of any nation! In other countries the pound, at ten pence, only yields the proportion of eighteen pence; but certainly twelve pence out of the pound at ten pence were &s;ufficient. The &s;ize of the coin might be doubled without any inconvenience, &s;ave to the forgers; and there is an ample field for fame to any patriot who&s;e &s;ituation may enable him to contribute to the remedy of &s;o large an evil.</P>
<P>Having concluded this &s;hort view of the money of England, before the &s;ubject is left, it is proper that &s;ome coins &s;hould be mentioned, which, being of confined currency, could not well be arranged with the ca&s;h of the kingdom. Such indeed are the town pieces, and trade&s;|mens' tokens above noted; and which would have been fir&s;t mentioned here, had they not
<PB N="168" REF="208">been of &s;uch connection with the copper coin|age, that they could not well be &s;eparated. The fir&s;t that &s;hall be mentioned therefore are what are called the Portcullis coins of Elizabeth, coined in rival&s;hip of the Spani&s;h king, for the &s;ervice of her Ea&s;t India Company in their &s;et|tlements abroad. They are of different &s;izes from the crown downwards, and are ea&s;ily di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the Portcullis on the rever&s;e. The&s;e may be regarded as the fir&s;t peculiar go|vernment money; for the coins of Engli&s;h monarchs, &s;truck in France and Ireland, are not con&s;iderable in this view, but circulated thro all their dominions.</P>
<P>To them &s;ucceed the various &s;iege-pieces of Charles I. in gold and &s;ilver, &s;ome of the latter being &s;o large as to be of forty &s;hillings value. A de&s;cription of the&s;e pieces were as endle&s;s as unnece&s;&s;ary; and it were likewi&s;e needle&s;s to dwell upon the Bombay money; upon lord Baltimore's or the other American coin, one of the be&s;t of which is the two penny, penny, half-penny, and farthing of George I. marked with a ro&s;e, ROSA AMERICANA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was another &s;eheme of Wood, who had the Iri&s;h pa|tent. The&s;e coins are all of Bath metal, a mixture of bra&s;s and copper.</NOTE>.

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE II.</HI> Engli&s;h Medals.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t Engli&s;h medal known is that of Henry VIII. &s;truck in 1545. It is of gold, larger than a crown piece, and has the king's head full-faced upon the obver&s;e, with three legends within each other of his titles and other matter. The rever&s;e contains two in|&s;criptions, declarative of his being the head of the church, &amp;c. the fir&s;t in Hebrew, the other in Greek. This was imitated in all points by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Edward VI. in his coronation me|dal, being the fir&s;t we have. There are other medals of Henry VIII. the large&s;t of which in &s;ilver is that with his &s;ide face upon the front, and titles, and a portcullis on the rever&s;e, with this legend, SECVRITAS ALTERA.</P>
<P>Elizabeth pre&s;ents us with a good number of medals, one or two of which are tolerable, but the re&s;t very poor, inferior indeed to tho&s;e of Philip and Mary, two of whom in &s;ilver by Trezzo are of high relief, and good execution. The medal of Elizabeth mentioned in the Spec|tator, as &s;truck upon the defeat of the Ar|mada, with this device, a fleet &s;cattered by the winds, AFFLAVIT DEVS, ET DISSIPANTVR,
<PB N="170" REF="210">is no where to be &s;ound, tho prints of two re&s;embling it may be &s;een in Evelyn's <HI>Numi&s;|mata;</HI> one of which being quoted from me|mory, no doubt occa&s;ioned the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Decent medals appear of James I. and his queen: and a very large one of Charles I. and Henrietta, in 1636, de&s;erves notice from its fine workman&s;hip. The rever&s;e repre&s;ents Ju&s;tice and Peace ki&s;&s;ing, aukwardly enough; but the execution of the king's bu&s;t, and that of his lovely queen, is very ma&s;terly. The <HI>tout en&s;emble</HI> of the piece is however bad, and quite unlike the antique, the &s;tandard of per|&s;ection in this way; owing to the field of the medal not being above a line thick, while the relievos are a full half inch in thickne&s;s; whereas, in the be&s;t and bolde&s;t ancient medal|lions, the edge of the piece is two or three lines thick, where the relief is three or four. A hollowne&s;s is indeed given in the ancient to the inner field around the relief, both to give more elevation and boldne&s;s, and that the edge may &s;omething protect the &s;ubjects of the field. As the above is a great deficiency in many mo|dern medals, it was thought proper to point it out: tho&s;e with this fault being indeed not me|dals, but embo&s;&s;ed pieces of metal.</P>
<P>To enumerate the many Engli&s;h medals were a vain and unnece&s;&s;ary attempt, nor, after the
<PB N="171" REF="211">well-known miracles of Simon, do any remark|ble occur till the fine gold, &s;ilver, and copper ones of Queen Anne appeared. Only two or three different pieces of the fir&s;t were &s;truck; but, in the other medals of this prince&s;s, we have a &s;eries of all the great events with which Marlborough illuminated her reign.</P>
<P>About 1740, and for &s;ome years before and after, Da&s;&s;ier, a native of Geneva, &s;ettling in London, engraved a &s;eries of medals of all the Engli&s;h kings with great ta&s;te and &s;pirit. They are &s;truck upon fine copper, and amount to thirty-&s;ix in number.

<P>Tho&s;e who wi&s;h for fuller information of Engli&s;h medals, may have recour&s;e to Mr. Snelling's plates of them; as indeed figures, which bring the objects before the eye, con|&s;titute the only plan of &s;tudying this branch of my &s;ubject, if no opportunity is pre&s;ent for that be&s;t of all methods, the peru&s;ing of the medals them&s;elves.</P>

<P>There is no certainty of any coins being &s;truck in Scotland till the reign of Alexander II. which began in the year 1214. Tho&s;e a&s;cribed to Alexander I. there is little doubt, belong to the &s;econd prince of that name; el&s;e many would be found in the long reign of David, who &s;ucceeded Alexander I. and tho the &s;hort time, which Malcolm IV.

Malcolm IV. or William the Lion, are found, which are not a&s;cribed to other princes by the be&s;t medalli&s;ts: tho&s;e of the la&s;t, in particular, belonging to William the Conqueror, only &s;truck in Nor|mandy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the &s;ucceeding ab&s;tract of Scoti&s;h coin, Ruddiman's pre|face to Ander&s;on's Diplomata$et Numi&s;mata Scotice, Edinburgi, 1739, folio. and Snelling on Scoti&s;h coin, London, 1776, 4to. have been the chief guides. The latter only lived to de&s;cribe the &s;ilver coin; but has plates of the gold and billon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;eries from Alexander II. has not the&s;e difficulties to combat, and it is therefore from that king only that we &s;hall date the commence|ment
<PB N="173" REF="213">of Scoti&s;h coin. Nor is it any wonder that no money &s;hould be &s;truck in that king|dom till &s;o late a period, when its want of mines, and its di&s;tance from any country where &s;ilver, the only metal anciently u&s;ed for coin|age, is found, are attended to. Not to add that the kingdom, by no means opulent when complete, was divided into different &s;tates, till the ninth century, when the Picts were &s;ub|dued. Soon after that event however the mo|ney of England &s;eems to have made a gradual progre&s;s into Scotland, as would appear from the different Engli&s;h coins of the Saxon and Norman princes there found: and prior to that period all bargains mu&s;t have been by ex|change; and indeed long after among the poor, for the Engli&s;h ca&s;h was no doubt confined to the higher cla&s;s.</P>
<P>From the Engli&s;h the people of Scotland de|rived, and now derive, mo&s;t of their improve|ments; and, among others, are &s;urely indebted to them for the example of their coin. The Scoti&s;h money indeed continued, as we know from authentic records, the very &s;ame with that of England in &s;ize and value till the time of David II. 1355, who&s;e va&s;t ran&s;om drained the Scoti&s;h coin, and occa&s;ioned a diminution of &s;ize in the little left.

<P>After the ran&s;om of David II. the Scoti&s;h coin gradually dimini&s;hing, in the fir&s;t year of Robert III. it pa&s;&s;ed only for half its nominal value in England; and at length, in 1393 Richard II. ordered that it &s;hould only go for the weight of the genuine metal in it<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stat. 1393. C. 1.</NOTE> To clo&s;e this point at once, the Scoti&s;h money equal in value to the Engli&s;h till 1355, &s;unk by degrees, reign after reign, owing to &s;ucceeding public calamities, and the con&s;equent impo|veri&s;hment of the kingdom, till in 1600 it was only a twelfth part value of Engli&s;h money of
<PB N="175" REF="215">the &s;ame denomination; and remained at that point till the union of the kingdoms cancelled the Scoti&s;h coinage. Having thus briefly di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed the comparative value of the Scoti&s;h mo|ney with the Engli&s;h, let us proceed to men|tion the &s;everal divi&s;ions of it.</P>
<P>To begin therefore with the SILVER: of Alex|ander II. who reigned till 1249, we have only pennies; but Edward I. of England in 1280, having coined half-pence and farthings, in ad|dition to the pennies till then the only coin, Alexander III. who &s;ucceeded Alexander II. and reigned till 1293, likewi&s;e coined half|pence; a few of which we have, but no far|things are found. The groat and half-groat in|troduced by David II. completed the denomi|nations of &s;ilver money till the reign of Mary, when they all cea&s;e to be &s;truck in &s;ilver: for about her time the price of &s;ilver was &s;o in|crea&s;ed, that they could no more be coined, ex|cept in <HI>billon</HI> of four parts copper, and one &s;ilver; which had been practi&s;ed by her prede|ce&s;&s;ors James II.

<PB N="176" REF="216">
<P>In 1544, the &s;econd year of Mary, four marks Scoti&s;h were equal to one mark Engli&s;h, that is, Scoti&s;h money was a fourth of that of England. About 1550 &s;hillings, or te&s;toons, were fir&s;t coined, bearing the bu&s;t of the queen, and the arms of France and Scotland on the rever&s;e; they, being of the &s;ame intrin&s;ic value as tho&s;e of England, were then worth four &s;hillings; the half-te&s;toons two, Scoti&s;h money. Marks of thirteen &s;hillings and four pence Scoti&s;h were al&s;o &s;truck, worth three &s;hillings and four pence Engli&s;h. During the commo|tions of this reign, the coinage appears not to have been directed, as anciently, by acts of Par|liament, but by orders of Privy Council, and oftener, it would &s;eem, by contract and imme|diate order of the queen. Hence the po&s;itive dates of &s;ome new kinds cannot be fixt; yet it may &s;afely be pre&s;umed that about 1560 crown-pieces of &s;ilver, equal to the Engli&s;h, appeared and went for 25<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Scoti&s;h, with the half, &s;ome|times called the mark of 12<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> Scoti&s;h, and quarter of 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 3<ABBR><HI>d,</HI></ABBR> the coin being then as 1 to 5. But it is amazing with what rapidity the coin of Scotland declined in the cour&s;e of a few years; for in 1565, by act of the Privy Council of that kingdom, the crown, weighing an ounce, went for 30<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Scoti&s;h; and le&s;&s;er pieces of 20<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> and 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> were &s;truck in proportion; &s;o that the coin was to the Engli&s;h as 1 to 6.

<P>To clo&s;e this account of the Scoti&s;h &s;ilver coin with a few unconnected remarks, it may be fir&s;t ob&s;erved, that the money of that coun|try is equal to the cotemporary Engli&s;h, and often &s;uperior in workman&s;hip. This is owing indeed merely to the chance of employing &s;u|perior arti&s;ts. The coin of James V. in parti|cular, is much better executed than that of Henry VIII. The groat of James V, in which he always appears with a &s;ide face, is a very good coin; as are the different pieces of Mary, particularly her te&s;toons; but the fine crown of her and Henry Darnley, engraved in Ander|&s;on, is &s;o very &s;carce that few have &s;een it. It is a pity that the portrait of this prince&s;s &s;o &s;eldom appears upon her money. The be&s;t heads of her are tho&s;e upon the &s;hillings, 1553, &amp;c. and gold coins of equal &s;ize, mo&s;tly marked 1555, below the bu&s;t; which la&s;t are &s;uppo&s;ed

<P>There is a &s;ingular defect in the groats of Robert II. who, &s;ucceeding David II, there is no alteration but of the name; the head, and every thing el&s;e, remaining the &s;ame in tho&s;e of Robert as in them of David. A &s;trange in|&s;tance of the &s;tate of the arts in Scotland at that period! tho, if I mi&s;take not, it is paralleled by the coin of England much later, for there are groats of the fir&s;t year of Henry VIII. in which there is no alteration from tho&s;e of his father but in the numeral. The great &s;eals of the five fir&s;t Jame&s;es have &s;imilar ab&s;urdity, the portraits being the &s;ame, whatever minute al|terations may be made otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The GOLD coinage of Scotland will not de|tain us long. In this, as u&s;ual, the Engli&s;h example was imitated. Edward III. having given the fir&s;t currency in this metal, 1344, about thirty years afterwards Robert II. i&s;&s;ued his; for, tho the princes of the middle ages, unhappily, neyer thought of adding numerals, declarative which of the name they were, yet I &s;cruple not, from analogy, to a&s;cribe the fir&s;t gold coinage to Robert II, and not to Robert
<PB N="181" REF="221">III, as others have done. Indeed, it is more probable that this &s;hould happen about thirty years after 1344, when gold fir&s;t appeared in Engli&s;h coinage, than at a longer di&s;tance. However, it is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t upon a point of which no proof has hitherto ari&s;en, e&s;pecially when it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the gold coins of the &s;econd from tho&s;e of the third Robert. Certain it is, that no gold was coined prior to the reign of Robert II.</P>
<P>The gold coins of Scotland are not upon the &s;cale of the Engli&s;h, but of much &s;maller model. They were fir&s;t called St. Andrews, from the figure of that tutelar &s;aint upon his cro&s;s, who appears on them, with the arms of Scotland, a lion in a &s;hield, on the rever&s;e. Mr. Ander&s;on has not given us the names of the gold coins which he delineates, nor indeed are mo&s;t of them to be learned by any po&s;&s;ible re&s;earch. We know, however, that the Lion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gold coins, which Edward the Black Prince &s;truck in France, were, in like manner, termed Leopards, from that ani|mal, part of the then Engli&s;h arms, being on the rever&s;e. They weigh half the noble. Le Lion was a French coin of early date. See Le Blanc.</NOTE>was another name for the large&s;t gold coin, from the Scoti&s;h arms upon it; and that the chief gold pieces of James V. were the Bonnet-pieces, &s;o called from the particular cap, re|&s;embling
<PB N="182" REF="222">indeed a Scoti&s;h bonnet, in which that king's head appears upon them. The&s;e bonnet-pieces are of very fine execution, and almo&s;t equal to the ancient coins, that prince being the fir&s;t who contracted the &s;ize of the coin, without dimini&s;hing its weight, in imitation of the French; an improvement not adopted by the Engli&s;h for a whole century afterwards, when, under Oliver, Simon contracted the ridi|culous thinne&s;s and extent of the &s;overeign and broad piece into a &s;hapely twenty &s;hilling piece. The la&s;t gold coinage of Scotland is the pi|&s;tole and half-pi&s;tole, coined by William II., in 1701, worth 12<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and 6<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Scoti&s;h.</P>
<P>It may be &s;afely imagined that the Engli&s;h names of many gold coins were adopted in Scotland, along with the coins them&s;elves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix, N^o III, for farther illu&s;trations upon the and other point$ relating to Scoti&s;h coin.</NOTE>. Little al&s;o is known with regard to the gold coinage of Scotland, &s;ave that it fell in the &s;ame proportion of ideal value with the &s;ilver. That great prince James I. of Scotland ordered both the gold and &s;ilver money to be put upon a par with that of England; but after his reign, which was, unhappily, not of long dura|tion, they ru&s;hed down with more velocity, like a &s;tream which breaks a bank &s;et again&s;t its winter force.</P>
<PB N="183" REF="223">
<P>The COPPER coinage of Scotland, tho more ancient than that of England, is by no means of &s;o early a date as &s;ome writers would make it. Copper was not coined in France till the time of Henry III. about 1580; and I doubt much if it was lawful coin in any modern &s;tate till the middle of that century. Certain it is, that the Scoti&s;h had the idea no where but from the French; and I am convinced that the notion of a copper coinage was brought over from France, &s;oon after its appearance in that kingdom.</P>
<P>In Dr. Hunter's noble collection there is a coin ranked with copper, and attributed to James II. to whom it may indeed belong, tho I take it to be of James III.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has a bu&s;t on one &s;ide, IACOBVS DEI GRATIA; re|ver&s;e, a cro&s;s, with fleurs de luce and crowns, alternate, REX SCOTORVM. There is another of Mary, quite &s;imilar; both have the full-face. Groats of James V. appear there of this kind al&s;o.</NOTE> Whoever it is of, it is <HI>black-money,</HI> and not copper coinage, and is of a &s;ize meant to pa&s;s for a half-groat. Hi&s;torians mention that one of the chief crimes imputed to James III. was his coining of <HI>black-money;</HI> and the copper, as it is called, attri|buted to James II, III, IV, and V, is all of this de&s;cription. Buchanan &s;peaks confu&s;edly of copper coined in Scotland before James III.; but he either means <HI>black-money,</HI> or was mi&s;|informed;
<PB N="184" REF="224">for in coinage he was never ver&s;ant, and therefore ea&s;ily mi&s;led. Mr. Ruddiman, upon the &s;ubject of the copper coinage of Scot|land, had certainly a de&s;ign to excite our ri&s;ibi|lity, when he tells us, gravely, that money of this metal may have been very ancient in Scot|land, but the &s;pecimens now totally de&s;troy|ed, by lying &s;o long in the ground. He ought to have known that ru&s;t pre&s;erves, and does not de&s;troy, copper; and that Roman copper coins, far more ancient than any Scoti&s;h could po&s;&s;ibly have been, are yet often found, in perfect pre|&s;ervation, to this day, even in the corroding &s;oil of Scotland, which he would paint as being as inimical to antiquities as that of Ireland is to vermin.</P>
<P>All the Scoti&s;h copper coin, down to James VI. may be &s;afely regarded as <HI>black-money,</HI> being of the &s;ize of groats, half groats, and pennies, and intended to go as &s;uch. The ex|ample of Henry VIII. of England had a bad effect upon mo&s;t of the money of Europe for &s;ome years after 1544, when he began &s;o much to deba&s;e the Engli&s;h coin. Hence more of the money of Mary is bad, than of her predece&s;&s;or James V. The reader mu&s;t beware of arrang|ing, as copper coin of Mary, the very common <HI>billon</HI> pieces, of about the &s;ize of a bodle, with a thi&s;tle crowned upon the front, and M. R. at the &s;ides, MARIA D. G. REGINA SCOTORVM;
<PB N="185" REF="225">and upon the rever&s;e two &s;cepters, cro&s;&s;ed, with a fleur de luce in the center, and a flouret of five leaves upon each &s;ide, OPPIDVM EDINBVRGI.

<P>During the reign of James VI. the copper coinage begun; and &s;peedily increa&s;ed in its &s;pecies. The penny, like the billon penny of Mary, has upon one &s;ide I. R. under a crown, IACOBVS D. G. R. SCO.; the rever&s;e, a lion rampant, VILLA EDINBVRG. The coin declining fa&s;t in &s;ize, and, in 1601, be|ing to the Engli&s;h as 1 to 12, and at its lowe&s;t value, unexpectedly the Scoti&s;h money a&s;&s;umed nearly the French &s;hape. For the <HI>bodle,</HI> equal in &s;ize to the <HI>liard,</HI> and worth two pennies Scoti&s;h, was &s;truck, and &s;o called from Bothwell, the mint-ma&s;ter at the time. The <HI>billon</HI> coin, worth &s;ix pennies Scoti&s;h, and called <HI>bas-piece,</HI> from the fir&s;t que&s;tionable &s;hape in which it appeared, being of what the French call <HI>bas-billon,</HI> or the wor&s;t kind of billon, was now &s;truck in copper, and termed, by the Scoti&s;h pronunciation, <HI>baw-bee.</HI> This corre|&s;ponded in value to the French <HI>&s;ol,</HI> and Eng|li&s;h halfpenny; and the penny Scoti&s;h, now

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE IV.</HI> Scoti&s;h Medals.</HEAD>
<P>To enumerate all the medals &s;truck in Scot|land were no difficult ta&s;k; but only one or two of the principal, and mo&s;t remarkable, are meant to be noticed here. The greater part, as may be &s;een in the latter plates of Ander&s;on's <HI>Numi&s;mata et Diplomata Scotioe,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e &s;truck in oval forms by Mary, containing a va|riety of devices upon the rever&s;es, that prince&s;s being fond of the&s;e &s;ymbols, which the fre|quent tournaments rendered at that time, and a whole century afterwards, a favourite &s;tudy of the French court, where &s;he received her edu|cation. The&s;e medals are very uncommon, e&s;pecially in this country, &s;o much &s;o indeed, that, not having &s;een any of them, I can &s;ay nothing of their execution.</P>
<P>It is worthy remark, that a Scoti&s;h medal of James IV, nece&s;&s;arily &s;truck before 1513, when he was killed at Flodden, &s;hould be the very fir&s;t Briti&s;h medal known, for it precedes that of Henry VIII. of England 32 years. I have never &s;een that piece, which mu&s;t indeed be almo&s;t unique, nor had Ander&s;on &s;een it, for Ruddiman gives it in his Prefatory Di&s;&s;ertation
<PB N="189" REF="229">from Evelyn's work on Medals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numi&s;mata, p. 88.</NOTE>, where the original print is to be found. The whole ap|pearance, characters, and every thing, are &s;o re&s;embling the coins of that prince, that not the &s;malle&s;t doubt of its coaeval authenticity can exi&s;t. The front contains a very fine por|trait of James IV. in the collar of the order of St. Michael, IACOBVS IIII. DEI GRATIA REX SCOTORVM. The rever&s;e pre&s;ents a Doric pillar (fit emblem of the unadorned &s;trength of Scot|land), with a bu&s;t of a kind of Janus, bearing two young laurelled heads, evidently both in|tended as portraits likewi&s;e of the king. This pillar &s;tands upon a &s;mall hill, beyond which is a view of the &s;ea, and land on either &s;ide, with this legend, VTRVMQVE. The two lands &s;een are evidently tho&s;e of France and England; and the whole device declares his prudent in|tention to have a watchful eye upon both. Mr. Evelyn thinks this remarkable medal was &s;truck in 1513, when James was preparing his force again&s;t England; but I &s;ee no po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on for this conjecture: and as there is no date on the piece, it will fit any year of his reign, from 1498 to 1513. Indeed there will be no improbability in &s;uppo&s;ing it even prior to the papal ones of Julius II, about 1510; for if a king of Arragon had a medal &s;truck in
<PB N="190" REF="230">1448, why may not a king of Scotland, not a much more remote province from Italy, the &s;eat of the renewal of this art, have one of 1500?</P>
<P>The next remarkable Scoti&s;h medal is that inaugurative of Francis II. of France and Mary of Scotland, tho it is more properly indeed French, being, as would &s;eem, &s;truck upon their coronation as king and queen of that country. It pre&s;ents bu&s;ts of Francis and Mary, face to face, with three legends around them, the outermo&s;t of which contains their titles, the middle one this &s;ingular &s;entence,
<Q>"Which wonders how the devil it got there:"</Q>
HORA NONA DOMINVS IHS EXPIRAVIT HELLI CLAMANS, a mo&s;t ominous motto, one would imagine, to a &s;uper&s;titious ear. The innermo&s;t legend is only the name of the city of Paris. There are fine French crowns of Francis and Mary, likewi&s;e pre&s;enting them face to face, with the arms of France and Scotland upon the rever&s;e, as is likewi&s;e the ca&s;e of the medal ju&s;t mentioned. The&s;e crowns are &s;o fine and rare that Dr. Hunter gave ten guineas for the one in his cabinet, which contains as va&s;t and well-cho&s;en a private collection of all &s;orts of coins and medals as any in the world.</P>
<P>The fine crown of Mary and Henry, 1565, is &s;o rare as to be e&s;teemed a medal of the
<PB N="191" REF="231">highe&s;t value; indeed it is wanting in the very fir&s;t cabinets, and there is no doubt but it would bring 40 or 50 guineas in a &s;ale. Henry and Mary appear on it, face to face, with their ti|tles; and the rever&s;e bears the arms of Scot|land, with this legend, QVOS DEVS CONIVNXIT BOMO NON SEPARET. It is &s;aid that the en|graver at fir&s;t placed the king's name before the queen's; but the latter being offended, the piece was altered. If any pattern exi&s;ts, before the alteration, it were invaluable to the curious collector.</P>
<P>Another remarkable medal of Mary is that which gives her portrait full-faced, and weep|ing, O GOD GRANT PATIENCE IN THAT I SVFFER VRANG. The rever&s;e has this in&s;crip|tion in the center, QVHO CAN COMPARE WITH ME IN GREIF&mdash;I DIE AND DAR NOCHT SEIK RELEIF; and this legend around, HOVRT NOT THE (figure of a heart) QVHAIS IOY THOV ART<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are medals of Lord Loudon, 1634, by Abraham Simon, and of Charles Seton Earl of Dunfermline, 1646, and the Earl of Lauderdale, by Thomas Simon.

<P>The la&s;t Scoti&s;h medal which &s;hall be men|tioned is the celebrated coronation medal of Charles I. when he underwent his inauguration at Edinburgh, 18 June, 633. This was exe|cuted by Briot, an eminent French arti&s;t. It

On the front is the king's bu&s;t, crown|ed and robed, with his titles. The rever&s;e bears a thi&s;tle growing, HINC NOSTRAE CRE|VERE ROSAE. Around the edge is, EX AVRO VT IN SCOTIA REPERITVR BRIOT FECIT EDINBVRGI, 1633. This medal is in the &s;tyle of what the French call <HI>piedforts,</HI> that is, very thick for its &s;ize, which is about that of half a crown. The relief is, however, very flat, and the whole workman&s;hip, if compared to Simon's, not highly laudable. The legend of the edge is very well, as the art then &s;tood, and is crenated with &s;mall upright &s;trokes, which have a good effect, and which I have ob|&s;erved in no other coin. There mu&s;t have been very few &s;truck on the Scoti&s;h gold; for not above three are known to exi&s;t, whereof one is in the Mu&s;eum.

It is &s;omething &s;urpri&s;ing that Mr. Simon, in his E&s;&s;ay on Iri&s;h coins, &s;peaks of Sihtric as a Dani&s;h prince who reigned in Ireland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Kedder, a native of Stockholm, and a &s;heer antiquary, in 170$ publi&s;hed <HI>Nummorum in Hibernia, antequam bac In&s;ula, &s;ub Hen|rico II.

He &s;eems to &s;hew the like want of knowlege as to Anlaff, ano|ther king of Northumberland, and to mention his Iri&s;h coin as of a monarch who reigned in Ireland only. This was certainly owing to his wi&s;h of giving Ireland one native and peculiar
<PB N="195" REF="235">coin at lea&s;t; for he allows the coins of Ethel|red, 866; Edred, 948; and Edgar, 959; to belong to Engli&s;h princes of tho&s;e names: as indeed, when all England obeyed one monarch in Egbert, Dublin, and that part of Ireland formerly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kings of North-umberland, of cour&s;e fell into the hands of Eg|bert and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Ireland, which was totally conquered, in Henry the Second's time, by Robert Fitz-Stephen and Richard Strong|bow earl of Pembroke, with 1630 men only, &s;eems to have been regarded by the former Engli&s;h monarchs as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion not worth holding after Ethelred II. 979, commenced the &s;truggles with the Danes by the inhuman and imprudent ma&s;&s;acre of all tho&s;e to be found in England. The &s;ucceeding Dani&s;h inva&s;ions called for all the &s;orce which the Engli&s;h mo|narchs could mu&s;ter, and there is little doubt but that during them the Engli&s;h garri&s;on was withdrawn from Ireland to &s;trengthen their own country; and the Engli&s;h dominion in Ireland was thus &s;ilently re&s;igned. The numerous petty monarchs conquered by the generals of Henry II. evince Ireland to have been, after the retreat of the Engli&s;h a century or two before, the &s;eat of numerous Fingalian chiefs, neither in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ilver or arti&s;ts to coin it.

<PB N="196" REF="236">what you will, of whom a &s;core could be &s;ub|dued by 1630 men, mu&s;t have been poor and weak indeed: and to look for their coinage were to look for that of the old chiefs of high|land clans.</P>
<P>In 1172 Henry II. was Lord of Ireland, for to take the name of king over &s;uch a country would have been deemed a profanation of that augu&s;t title; and this addition of Lord of Ire|land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;overeignty of Ireland was thus thought much inferior that of Aquitain, a province of France.

King of Ireland was a &s;tyle then de&s;pi&s;ed by the Engli&s;h monarchs, but that country is now one of the brighte&s;t jewels in their crown, and the title worthy of a rank with that fir&s;t in the world, King of Great Britain. None of the Iri&s;h coins of Henry II. are yet found: the fir&s;t are of John his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The Iri&s;h coins from John to Henry V. are known by the tri|angle enclo&s;ing the king's head: after Henry V. they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Iri&s;h cities where they were &s;truck. It may be &s;up|po&s;ed, indeed, that no Iri&s;h money was coined by Henry II. The triangle, which appears in that of John, is con&s;idered by &s;ome antiquaries as alluding to the triangular &s;hape of the harp$
<PB N="197" REF="237">the badge of Ireland. But it is merely a mark of di&s;tinction, and appears on coins of other countries about that period. The harp is never &s;een upon Iri&s;h coin till the reign of Henry VIII.; and it will be difficult to carry the anti|quity of that badge much higher.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h coin being the &s;ame in all re&s;pects with the other money &s;truck by the kings of England, it is perfectly needle&s;s to take any notice of it till &s;ome &s;light differences ari&s;e. The&s;e begin in 1601, when copper pennies and half-pence were coined for Ireland by Eliza|beth, tho &s;he would not li&s;ten to a copper coinage in England. The&s;e circulated in Ire|land when James I. publi&s;hed his copper far|thing-tokens; and the la&s;t are of two &s;izes, in order that if they failed in England they might be &s;ent to Ireland as pennies and half-pence. In 1635 a mint was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Dublin by Charles I.; but the Iri&s;h ma&s;&s;acre, and the un|happy di&s;turbances which followed, put a &s;top to it, and that plan has never &s;ince been re|&s;umed. After that ma&s;&s;acre, 1641, the papi&s;ts &s;truck what are called St. Patrick's half-pence and farthings, known by the legends FLOREAT REX; rever&s;e ECCE GREX; and the farthing QVIESCAT PLEBS. In Cromwell's time copper tokens were &s;truck by towns and trade&s;men, as in England. In 1680 half-pence and farthings were given by authority with the harp and date.</P>

<P>James II. arriving in Ireland from France in 1689, to make a &s;truggle for his lo&s;t domi|nions, he in&s;tituted a mint, and on the 18th June i&s;&s;ued &s;hillings; and half-crowns on the 27th of the &s;ame month. The&s;e coins are &s;truck of all the refu&s;e metal which could be got: &s;ome bra&s;s guns e&s;pecially were em|ployed, whence the coinage is generally called gun-money. The half-crowns gradually dimi|ni&s;hed in &s;ize, as the metal became &s;carce, from June 1689 to July 1690: and the month of their mintage being always upon them, this decrea&s;e is ea&s;ily marked. Pennies and half|pennies of lead mixed with tin, and crowns of white metal, were publi&s;hed in March 1690: and other crowns of gun-metal 15 June 1690, of the &s;ize of half-crowns, and known by having no month marked on them, as the half-crowns have. The crowns of white metal, which are very &s;carce, have James on hor&s;e|back, with titles no longer his; and on the re|ver&s;e the arms, CHRISTO VICIORE TRIVMPHO, with this legend on the rim, MELIORIS TESSERA FATI ANNO RTGNI SEXTO. James, however, having totally mi&s;taken Chri&s;t's meaning in the legend of his crown pieces, and being com|pletely defeated, left Ireland in July 1690; but a few half-pence were &s;truck in Limerick by his adherents, 1691, called <HI>Hibernias,</HI> from the rever&s;e.</P>

<P>In 1722 William Wood, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> acquired from George I. the famous patent which excited &s;uch di&s;content in Ireland. This was for coin|ing halfpence and farthings; and the lo&s;s to Ireland, from the &s;mall &s;ize allowed to the&s;e pieces by the patent it&s;elf, was e&s;timated at 60,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>; but Wood cau&s;ed them to be &s;truck of a far &s;maller form than the patent bore, &s;o that his gain would have been near 100,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> They are, however, of very fine copper and workman&s;hip; and have the be&s;t portrait of George I. perhaps to be any where found. Sir I&s;aac Newton, then at the head of the mint, &s;aid they were &s;uperior to the Engli&s;h in every thing but &s;ize. In 1737, 10th of George II, Iri&s;h halfpence and farthings were again coined of ju&s;t &s;ize and weight, with the harp only on the rever&s;e; and the like are continued to this day. There being no mint in Ireland they are all coined at the Tower, and &s;ent to that king|dom, whence they return in the cour&s;e of cir|culation, and are as common here as the Briti&s;h. In 1760, however, there was a great &s;carcity of copper coin in Ireland; upon which a &s;ociety of Iri&s;h gentlemen applied for leave, upon proper conditions, to coin halfpence; which being granted, tho&s;e appeared with a very bad por|trait of George II. and VOCE POPVLI around it. The bu&s;t bears a much greater re&s;emblance to the pretender; but whether this was a piece
<PB N="200" REF="240">of waggery in the engraver, or only aro&s;e from his ignorance in drawing, mu&s;t be left in doubt.</P>
<P>Since the abolition of the mint erected by Charles I, which happened about 1640, no gold or &s;ilver coins have been &s;truck with the Iri&s;h badge, but copper only. The gold and &s;ilver money, previous to the above period, is not di&s;tinct from that of England, but by the harp upon the rever&s;e after that &s;ymbol was adopted by Henry VIII.: and the triangle and names of cities, as mentioned before, upon the more ancient. To make any further relation of it were therefore unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>BEFORE &s;tating &s;ome notices upon this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, it will be proper to examine a little the metals employed in our mint.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain the purity of gold, a kind of mi|crometer is u&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ting of 24 degrees, each degree being again divided into quarters. The common e&s;timation of gold by carats is meant, the utmo&s;t finene&s;s of that metal being marked at the highe&s;t degree, or twenty four carats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de Jaucourt, in the Encyclopedic, &s;eems to &s;peak other|wi&s;e; for he tells us that an ounce of gold, at 24 carats fine, has 152 grains fine gold, and 24 grains alloy. Perhaps he &s;peaks of chymice gold. Encyclopedic, Neu&s;ch. 1765, art. MONNOYE.&mdash;It mu&s;t, $$owever, $word$ allowed, that no gold can be made quite &s;o fine as 24 carats, but always wants a quarter of a grain. Fine gold is $word$ and flexible as melting wax, but a very little alloy hardens it.</NOTE>.
<PB N="202" REF="242">The&s;e whole 24 carats, con&s;idered as a weight, form but about the &s;ixth part of an ounce Troy, or that u&s;ed in gold&s;mith's work and mintage; but are &s;eldom or never viewed in this light, the carat-weights being always em|ployed about pearls, precious &s;tones, gold, and &s;uch articles of &s;mall &s;ize and va&s;t price<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The carat-grain is but 10/$0 of the grain Troy, the carat being only 3 &frac13; grains Troy. The Venetians have an actual weight of proportion, called a carat, 150 to the ounce Troy, which is the rare of ours. See Harris on Money and Coins.</NOTE>. This divi&s;ion extends over almo&s;t all Europe; but in France the carat is &s;ometimes con&s;idered as containing 4 grains, and at other times as con&s;i&s;ting of 32 divi&s;ions, each divi&s;ion being the 8th part of a grain. The&s;e divi&s;ions are now and then inaccurately marked grains, by ignorant and carele&s;s writers; by which means we meet with 23 carats 16 grains, and the like, in &s;ome French works. The Engli&s;h gold-&s;miths have likewi&s;e the &s;maller divi&s;ions of 20 mites to the grain, 24 droits to the mite, 20 perits to the droit, and 24 blanks to the perit; but they are &s;eldom or never u&s;ed in &s;peaking of coinage.</P>
<PB N="203" REF="243">
<P>The gold employed in Engli&s;h coin was commonly twenty three carats three grains and a half fine; that is, contained only an 192<ABBR><HI>d</HI></ABBR> part alloy, till Henry VIII. deba&s;ed it, by de|grees, even to 20 carats, in his la&s;t coinage, of 1546. This was, however, the only coinage of that degree; but in mo&s;t &s;ucceeding reigns, to a very late period, I &s;uppo&s;e that of George I, coinages of gold have been given at 22 carats, &s;ometimes with two carats, and at others with only one carat, alloy. Such is called <HI>crown gold,</HI> becau&s;e the crowns and half-crowns of Henry VIII. were of that &s;tandard, as well as all the gold crowns and half-crowns of &s;uc|ceeding reigns. The gold has now its pri&s;tine cha&s;tity of twenty-three carats three grains and a half fine, and half a grain, of either &s;ilver or copper, alloy. This purity is only rivalled by the coin of Venice, which has the &s;ame; the other European gold being inferior, and &s;ome of it, as the French louis d'or, not above 21 carats fine.</P>
<P>The e&s;timate of &s;ilver is by the pound weight Troy, of 12 ounces, each ounce being 20 penny-weights, as the penny-weight is 24 grains. Our &s;ilver coinage is 11 ounces 2 penny-weights fine, with 18 penny-weights of copper alloy; that is, about a 13th part. The admi&s;&s;ion of &s;o much alloy is owing to the &s;oftne&s;s of the metal, which is very great; &s;o
<PB N="204" REF="244">that, even with this alloy, &s;ilver coinage is &s;oon &s;o much worn as to lo&s;e all impre&s;&s;ion. In|deed the only u&s;e of alloy, in genuine coinage, is to harden the fine metal, and to pay the ex|pences of the mint; not to add the great ex|pence there is in refining metal to its utmo&s;t purity, gold being never found above 22 carats fine, and &s;eldom that.</P>
<P>Of the copper nothing need be &s;aid, &s;ave that, in the fir&s;t coinages of that metal, Swedi&s;h copper was u&s;ed; but &s;ince &s;o many excellent mines of copper have been found in this i&s;land, the Engli&s;h has been employed.</P>
<P>The coinage of England, as always equal, or &s;uperior to any modern coinage, in the purity of the metals employed, &s;o has maintained an equal pre-eminence in workman&s;hip, till within a very late period. The u&s;e of the hammer in fabricating money being the only method fir&s;t known, was of very ea&s;y management and ex|pence; and hence the va&s;t number of mints known in almo&s;t every city of England during the fir&s;t reigns after the Conque&s;t, and the num|ber of moneyers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e names would &s;eem to have been of the engraver of the dye, not of the moneyer, by which name I under&s;tand ma&s;ter of the little mint; for the &s;ame names appear on Engli&s;h and Scoti&s;h money of the &s;ame period, and tho the arti&s;t might travel about, it is not to be thought that the ma&s;ter did.</NOTE> who&s;e names appear on the early coin, &s;ometimes amounting to a hundred,
<PB N="205" REF="245">or near, upon that of one prince. But illu&s;tra|tions upon the early Engli&s;h mints mu&s;t be left to &s;ome diligent antiquary, the &s;ubject never having as yet been examined properly, tho of much curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>It is the workman&s;hip of the Engli&s;h coinage which is meant to be the &s;ubject of this &s;ection. This, like that of all the world, during the middle ages, mu&s;t be allowed to have &s;mall title to prai&s;e. In the reign of Edward III, when gold, and a larger &s;ize of &s;ilver than pen|nies, were fir&s;t &s;truck, the coin is very tolerable, and certainly &s;uperior to any other money in the world of that period.</P>
<P>A remarkable feature of the modern ham|mered coin is its thinne&s;s, and large &s;ize in re|&s;pect of its value. Hence no relief could well be given to its impre&s;&s;ion, a fault certainly of choice, and not nece&s;&s;ity, for the hammer was the only mode known to the Greek and Roman mints.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine the I&s;t, or the Great, if you plea&s;e, is &s;aid to have ordered the Roman coin to be &s;truck thin, and con&s;equently with very little relief, in order that the common fraud of covering lead or copper with gold or &s;ilver, which we know the thickne&s;s of the ancient coin led to, might be prevented. But, in fact, the money got thinner and thinner, by the gradual decline of art, long before and after
<PB N="206" REF="246">the time of Con&s;tantine; and it was barbari&s;m, and not prevention of fraud, which cau&s;ed this alteration.</P>
<P>No great improvement can be ob&s;erved in the Engli&s;h coinage till the introduction of the mill in place of the hammer. The mill u&s;ed in mintage was invented by Antoine Brucher, in the reign of Henry II. of France; and the fir&s;t money was &s;truck with it in that kingdom in the year 1553. The u&s;e of it continued there till 1585, when, in the fifteenth year of Henry III., it was di&s;continued, becau&s;e of its great expence in compari&s;on of the other plan. Nor was it revived till 1645, when, by an edict of Louis XIV, it was e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever.</P>
<P>Elizabeth, ever zealous of the glory of her kingdom, and de&s;irous of making it, in every re&s;pect, equal to any other in Europe, had milled money, &s;truck in England, &s;o early as 1562. Its continuance, however, was not then above ten years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip Mo&s;t$el, a Frenchman, brought the mill over here, in the reign of Elizabeth. He was banged at Tyburn, for forging the coin of the kingdom, in 1569, 17th January. Stow's Annals, p. 662.&mdash;Did Elizabeth's milled money cea&s;e with him?</NOTE>, and the hammer was again adopted as of far le&s;s expence; an example which was &s;oon followed by France, as the after &s;ucce&s;s of the mill in England was the cau&s;e of its $$ e&s;tabli&s;hment in that kingdom, in 1645.</P>
<PB N="207" REF="247">
<P>Briot, a French arti&s;t of con&s;iderable merit, after making &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to per&s;uade the government of France to adopt again the u&s;e of the mill, came to England in 1623. Being favourably received, he &s;truck &s;everal coins, chie&s;ly pattern pieces, in this way; but the mill was not in con&s;tant and authorized u&s;e in the Engli&s;h mint till 1662. It has been ju&s;t &s;aid, that the &s;ucce&s;s of the mill in this country occa&s;ioned its re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in France, in 1645; and for this there is the au|thority of M. de Jaucourt, a well-informed writer: yet it is &s;omething doubtful if France did not &s;et the example to us; for it is certain that &s;o little of our coin was milled before 1662, that it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed any example of utility could be derived from it. The mill was always, from its invention, u&s;ed in France for medals and jettons, tho di&s;continued in common coinage; and it is probable that the ta&s;te for medals in&s;tilled into Louis XIV, and &s;hewn afterwards in the va&s;t number he &s;truck, was the great cau&s;e of the revival of the fine coinage, produced by means of the mill, in preference to the rudene&s;s of the modern ham|mered money.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, the coinage of England was, &s;oon after the revival of the mill in this kingdom by Briot, carried to a pitch of per|&s;ection which it never had reached; and, in
<PB N="208" REF="248">point of workman&s;hip, never will in future attain. The reader will in&s;tantly perceive that the miraculous works of Thomas Simon are meant; works which excell, and will ever excell any of the kind, either ancient or modern.</P>
<P>The greater number of medals any per&s;on has &s;een, the more he will be inclined to allow this prai&s;e to be ju&s;t. One of the &s;malle&s;t pieces of Simon, the little oval medal of Oliver, in copper, with the olive tree on the rever&s;e, may be compared with the mo&s;t fini&s;hed works of other medallic arti&s;ts, not excepting the great names of Pari&s;e, Karl&s;teen, Hamerani, Da&s;&s;ier, Urbani, Croker, and Heydlinger. What then &s;hall be &s;aid of his large and mo&s;t elaborate productions? But referring tho&s;e who wi&s;h for fuller information upon this point to Mr. Ver|tue's Account of Simon's Works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An improved edition of this work has lately been publi&s;hed, with valuable additions, by Mr. Gough.</NOTE>, a few re|marks only, pertinent to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject of the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h coinage, &s;hall be laid before the reader, with regard to the la|bours of this &s;urprizing arti&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t coins of Simon are the gold and &s;ilver pieces of the Commonwealth, 1648. After he had been brought from York&s;hire, &s;uppo&s;ed his native county, by Briot, on his

The crown and half-crown of Blondeau have a legend on the edge; his &s;hilling and &s;ixpence are grained. The patterns of Ramage, who was employed by the mint, have the &s;hield of England, &s;upported by angels, with the legend, G$ARDED WITH ANGELS. All the&s;e patterns are very &s;carce, but particularly tho&s;e of Ramage, who only &s;truck $$ patterns in all, while Blondeau took 300.

But, under Oliver, the old aukward broad piece begins fir&s;t to a&s;&s;ume the more decent, tho by no means perfect, form of the guinea; and the whole coin gets more &s;olid and compact.

The&s;e are the gold; and the &s;ilver con&s;i&s;ts of the crown, half-crown, &s;hilling, and half-&s;hilling. Of the&s;e the crowns are very &s;carce; and the dye having received a flaw below the neck, after a few were &s;truck, tho&s;e without the line occa&s;ioned by this flaw are &s;till of much greater &s;carcity than the others. But the want of this mark of the flaw is by no means to be e&s;teemed a &s;ign of forgery, as Mr. Leake &s;trangely tells us; as if coins of Simon were to be counter-feited! The half-crown is not &s;o &s;carce, but of equal beauty: the &s;hilling is the mo&s;t com|mon, but very &s;ine. The &s;ixpence, or half-&s;hilling,

<P>In all the&s;e coins the mill is u&s;ed, and their perfection evinces the merit of that invention; but they are &s;o &s;carce that an opinion has been entertained that the money of Oliver never was in circulation.

The $en-&s;hilling piece, and the half-&s;hilling, could $ever be in circulation: of crowns very few ever circulate, becau&s;e few are &s;truck, and even $ho&s;e few are hoarded; and it is likely that not many of the half-crowns were i&s;&s;ued.

<P>As, in this illu&s;trious coinage, the mill fir&s;t $i&s;played its advantages in full &s;plendor, and an
<PB N="212" REF="252">article new to our money, and, it is &s;u&s;pected, to that of any other kingdom, the marking a legend on the edge was introduced, it will not be improper to dwell a moment upon the&s;e points. The advantages of the mill over the former method are indeed &s;o obvious, upon a bare compari&s;on of the products, that it is al|mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to mention that one of the greate&s;t of the&s;e advantages con&s;i&s;ts in the firm and uniform force lent to the dye at once, &s;o much &s;uperior to the repeated exertions of the hammer. By this means an impre&s;&s;ion, infinitely &s;uperior, is given; and the mo&s;t minute &s;trokes are procured from the dye, in all their delicacy, If the reader would &s;ee the difference between the mill and the hammer, in point of delicacy, let him compare the fro&s;t-work in the &s;hields of the Commonwealth money with that on the coins of Oliver.</P>
<P>It is believed that Simon fir&s;t introduced the idea of marking the crown and half-crown with a legend on the edge, as an ornament and protection to the coin. Of this art the inventor is unknown; but the fir&s;t piece, which is yet known to be an in&s;tance of it, is a medal of Fer|dinand Duke of Florence, in 1603. We have &s;een that Briot gave the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of it in Great Britain upon his Scoti&s;h coronation me|dal, 1633; and Simon now introduced it into the larger coin, with great propriety, as it is
<PB N="213" REF="253">both ornamental, and pre&s;erves &s;uch pieces from being clipped.</P>
<P>The method in which this was performed till 1685, when a better plan &s;ucceeded, tho given in the Encyclopedie, is yet conveyed in &s;o &s;hort a manner, that, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it is not intel|ligible to me; but the original de&s;cription, with what can be made of it, will be found be|low<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>&startq;Cotte operation &s;e fai&s;oit en mettant le flanc dane unc vir&s;e ju&s;te, qu'il excedoit de hauteur; et en frappant de&s;&s;us plu&s;ieurs coups de balancier; la matiere s'etendoit, et re&ccedil;evoit l'em|preinte &endq;des lettres qui etoient grav&eacute;es fur la virole.</Q> Encycl. art. <HI>Monnoye.</HI> That is, literally tran&s;lated: <Q>This operation &startq;was performed by putting the piece, before it was &s;tamped with the dye, into a ferule of its &s;ize, which it however exceeded in height; and in &s;triking it with repeated &s;trokes of the pre&s;s or mill, the metal extended it&s;elf, and received the impre&s;&s;ion of &endq;the letters which were engraved on the ferule.</Q> The difficulty lyes in there being no de&s;cription of this <HI>virole,</HI> or ferule: we are indeed referred to that article, of which all that is the lea&s;t like the matter runs thus: <Q>VIROLE: petite bande de for, d'argent, &startq;ou$d'autre metal, qui &s;ert et entoure le petit bout du manche d'une cle&s;ne, &s;erpette, marteau, pe&s;on, couteau, &amp;c. qui &s;ert a &endq;tenir la meche de l'alumele ferme dans le manche.</Q> <Q>A <HI>virole</HI> &startq;is a &s;mall fillet of iron, &s;ilver, or other metal, which clo&s;ely &s;urrounds the &s;mall end of the handle of knives, ham|mers, &s;pindles, &amp;c.: and which &s;erves to hold the in&s;erted part &endq;of the knife firm in its handle.</Q> This is nothing: but &s;uch is the Encyclopedic, which, with its eternal references to other ar|ticles in con&s;equence of its horrible plan, and blunders thence ari&s;ing, may be &s;afely regarded, if con&s;idered as a whole, as a di&s;|grace, and not an ornament, to &s;cience.</NOTE>The proce&s;s, &s;ince 1685, is by means of a very &s;imple, but not the le&s;s ingenious, machine, invented by M. Ca&s;taing, and then
<PB N="214" REF="254">fir&s;t introduced into the French mint; but &s;ince, it is believed, into all the mints in Eu|rope; a de&s;cription of which, taken from the Encyclopedie, &s;hall now be laid before the rea|der. This proce&s;s is indeed kept a &s;evere &s;e|cret at our mint, and the men employed &s;worn not to reveal it; but as it is openly done at all other mints, and given in &s;o well known a book as the Encyclopedie, and in the Engli&s;h Cyclo|pedias, there can be no harm in &s;tating it here.</P>
<P>The machine for this purpo&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of two plates of &s;teel, each being in the oblong &s;hape of a flat ruler, of about a line thick. Upon their edge is engraved the legend, half upon one plate, and half upon the other. One of the&s;e plates is motionle&s;s, and fa&s;tened with &s;crews to a plate of copper, which is again &s;e|cured to a very thick table.</P>
<P>Sometimes little plates which bear the le|gends are fa&s;tened in the in&s;ide of the above plates of &s;teel, and at other times the legend is engraved upon the latter them&s;elves; but the former &s;eems the be&s;t way, if the legend is often changed.</P>
<P>The other plate of &s;teel is moveable, and is placed parallel to the fixed one, at a di&s;tance proper to admit the coin between them. The moveable plate &s;lides upon the plate of copper, to which the other is fa&s;tened, by means of a$
<PB N="215" REF="255">pinioned or indented iron wheel moved by a handle, the teeth of this wheel catching an indentation which is upon the upper face of the &s;liding plate of &s;teel, and &s;o moving it a|long.</P>
<P>From the prints which accompany the de|&s;cription, it appears that the &s;mall plates, upon which the legend is mo&s;t commonly engraved, are &s;o cut upon the in&s;cribed edge, that, below the letters in each, and all along that &s;ide, runs a &s;mall projection of metal, upon which the coin may roll without falling down between them, or touching the copper plate below. When the machine is therefore ready for the in&s;ertion of the coin, the two plates with the legend on their edges are even at the ends, and the legend runs &s;o that the fir&s;t half of it being on the moveable one, for in&s;tance, the other half on the fixed plate &s;tands exactly oppo&s;ite to it.</P>
<P>Thus the piece before it is coined, being placed horizontally between the &s;teel plates, is led on by the motion of that which is move|able, joined to the letters catching its edges, &s;o that, when it has de&s;cribed a &s;emicircle, both halves of the legend are upon it, and it is en|tirely marked. When it reaches the end of the legend, and of the &s;teel plates, it falls off, and drops thro a hole in the table into any recepta|cle which is placed to receive it.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="256">
<P>For this de&s;cription, which I hope is very clear, I am more indebted to the plates than to the account given in the Encyclopedie, which is a very brief, and of con&s;equence a very lame one. We are there told, that by the help of this machine one man may mark 20,000 coins in a day.</P>
<P>To return to the coins of Simon, that won|derful arti&s;t continued in his employment at the mint after the Re&s;toration; but hammered money being again &s;truck after that event, his &s;kill was le&s;s vi&s;ible in the coin, and was chiefly exerted in &s;everal fine medals, &s;eals, &amp;c. Yet, when the u&s;e of the mill was, in 1662, finally adopted, Simon found him&s;elf neglected by Charles II., who had brought over two Flemi&s;h arti&s;ts called Roettiers with him, whom he em|ployed in the coinage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Others &s;ay, the Roettiers were called over in 1662 by the di|rectors of the mint, as Simon's works proceeded too &s;lowly. The fir&s;t milled money of 1662 is by the Roettiers.</NOTE>. Simon, in the pride of emulation, produced that exqui&s;ite crown piece, commonly called, by way of eminence, his Tryal Piece, which will ever be the wonder of the world. From the RELIEF implored of the king in the petition round the edge, it would &s;eem that Simon's large family encum|bered him much, for the &s;alary was 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year$ and he had made con&s;iderable &s;ums by his works, for which he was paid be&s;ides, &s;o as to
<PB N="217" REF="257">be the proprietor of a farm or two. However, even this wonderful piece of workman&s;hip had no effect upon Charles, who&s;e ta&s;te and facul|ties were always be&s;otted with low plea&s;ures. Roettier continued in employment; and of Si|mon we know little more but that he died, in 1665, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, of the plague, but, ac|cording to others, after he retired into his na|tive county. Suppo&s;ing him twenty years of age when taken under Briot's care in 1633, he was only fifty-two when he died, leaving behind him the ju&s;t reputation of being the fir&s;t arti&s;t in this line whom the world had beheld, or could hope to behold. His works might in|deed have been more perfect, had they more re|lief; but, for the want of this, his inimitable fro&s;t-work atones, by deepening the &s;hades, and thus giving the full effect of high relief. It might more ju&s;tly be &s;aid that, had he confined this fro&s;t work to the fle&s;h, for which its &s;oftne&s;s finely adapts it, and given the hair and gar|ments in another &s;tyle, his works would have been perfection it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It has ever been the cur&s;e of this country that, while it &s;uperabounds in men calculated for all the arts and employments, yet, by a &s;ingular frenzy, foreigners are always &s;ure to obtain the preference. This mu&s;t &s;trike every per&s;on in the competition of Simon, a &s;uperla|tive native arti&s;t, with Roettier, a very middling
<PB N="218" REF="258">foreign one. But &s;uch has ever been the ca&s;e; tho in a country equal, as this is, to any in the world for every art, &s;ave painting, it is a &s;hame to put foreign arti&s;ts into tho&s;e &s;ituations, which &s;uperior &s;kill and excellence, with other grand con&s;iderations, entitle natives alone to fill. In a kingdom where the natives are not equal to the arts, as is the ca&s;e in Ru&s;&s;ia ju&s;t now, fo|reigners ought to be employed; but, in any other, it is a tacit confe&s;&s;ion, either of the igno|rance of its arti&s;ts, or of the contempt which the government entertains of its own &s;ubjects. The madne&s;s of this predilection for foreigners, who pick our pockets, and call us a liberal nation, cannot be better demon&s;trated, than in the hi&s;|tory of our coin. Simon and Croker are the only arti&s;ts who&s;e works have done honour to the Briti&s;h coinage; and they were both natives of England.</P>
<P>Till the reign of Queen Anne the coinage re|ceived no improvement, and made no progre&s;s. In that reign Mr. Croker was chief engraver at the mint, and to him we are indebted for many excellent medals, and pattern pieces, which rank his name next to that of Simon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a pity that the works of this great arti&s;t, with &s;ome ac|count of him, are not given to the public in the &s;ame way with tho&s;e of Simon. Dyes of medals, &amp;c. engraved by Croker, to the amount of 150, with &s;everal of the puncheons, are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Martin, of King Street, Covent Garden.</NOTE>. Of the
<PB N="219" REF="259">former the &s;eries of Queen Anne's medals, a &s;eries equal to the glorious actions which gave &s;ubject to them, con&s;titute a grand &s;pecimen: of the latter, the celebrated farthings are well known. The pattern farthings with peace in a chariot, PAX MISSA PER ORBEM, and tho&s;e with Britannia under a porch, are the fine&s;t and rare&s;t: the fir&s;t would however be more perfect did not the traces of the car, injudiciou&s;ly brought in next the eye, give the appearance of a &s;law; whereas in ancient coins, and in the truth of nature, they are utterly invi&s;ible in &s;o diminutive a delineation.</P>
<P>The whole coinage of Queen Anne, and part of that of George I. which is of this arti&s;t, is en|titled to prai&s;e. It afterwards continued in a to|lerable condition till the commencement of the pre&s;ent reign, when it fell into the deplorable &s;tate in which we now view it. In the fir&s;t gold coinage of this reign, the face was quite a mo|del, de&s;titute of all feature and character: and another portrait has been given &s;ince 1770, or a year or two before or after, with &s;uch gro&s;s faults as to make our coinage a matter of laughter. For the head being mo&s;t &s;weetly and langui&s;hingly &s;crewed about to the left, &s;o that a great part of it &s;hould appear, yet, to our a&s;toni&s;hment, no head is to be &s;een; &s;o that the malicious joke of Foote might jump into any one's mouth. In&s;tead of the due proportion of
<PB N="220" REF="260">head and hair, we only perceive the face cut off from the head, and a few rude lines &s;cratched where the junction mu&s;t have been, evidently put there that ladies might not be &s;hocked with the &s;tudy of anatomy.</P>
<P>Our gold coin can only be rivalled by our copper. The fir&s;t halfpence pre&s;ent &s;uch a face as human creature never wore, jutting out &s;omething in the likene&s;s of a macaw. The latter ones are improved a little; and in this our copper coin has a preference over our gold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pattern &s;hilling of 1778 exceeds all our coinage. It is perfection it&s;elf&mdash;in the <HI>bathos</HI> of art.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of coinage in any kingdom is com|monly a barometer of its power, always of the &s;tate of its arts. Hence it is matter of national glory, that the coin be well executed; and the decline of the money is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed a &s;ure &s;ymptom of the decline of the &s;tate. Some grey-haired medalli&s;ts, from this circum&s;tance, foretold the lo&s;s of America, and all the cala|mities which, during this reign, have ha&s;tened the decline of Britain. Je&s;ting apart, whatever may be the ca&s;e with our glory, our coin may rank with that of the lowe&s;t times of the Ro|man empire.</P>
<P>It is not therefore &s;urprizing to hear that a noble Lord has projected a wonderful improve|ment
<PB N="221" REF="261" MS="Y">upon our money, and has actually got pattern pieces &s;truck upon this new plan. The intent of this project is, that all our coin &s;hall be in <HI>cameo,</HI> not <HI>intaglio;</HI> cut hollow, not in re|lief. Were it to take effect, what would be the <HI>nummi bracteati,</HI> or all the efforts of the politer Goths of antiquity, to our currency? May the noble Lord appear upon one of the fir&s;t hollow coins, in all his glory!</P>
<P>But &s;urely the whole plan of coinage is yet &s;u&s;ceptible of real and mo&s;t important improve|ments. A far higher relief might be given to the impre&s;&s;ion, &s;o as to rival the ancient in this grand criterion of good coin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To give more relief to our coinage would take more time, and employ more arti&s;ts; but what are a few hundred pounds to a nation when its perpetual glory is intere&s;ted?</NOTE>; and this relief might with ea&s;e be protected by a circle of equal height around the rim of the piece. This circle would not only &s;erve to pre&s;erve the coin, but might, in the whole coinage, bear a legend upon the edge; an operation &s;o &s;imple as to appear upon the tin halfpence, when they were in u&s;e. This circular legend, now u&s;ed only upon the crown and half-crown, ought to adorn and protect every coin, from the five-guinea piece down to the farthing; for there cannot be &s;o ea&s;y and &s;o effectual a guard again&s;t forgery. The legends ought to be
<PB N="222" REF="262">placed within the circle, and that on the edge might extend over the whole &s;urface, &s;o as no|thing could be taken from the coin without ap|pearance. The copper coinage of 1717, and gold coinage of 1728, are &s;omething in the general &s;tyle of this propo&s;ed, but not of &s;uffi|cient relief, and without the circular legends. Such as they are, however, the&s;e coinages ought to be recommended, as of the very be&s;t form which has ever yet appeared.</P>
<P>As to the obver&s;e, the decorating a modern prince with a crown of laurel, an ornament never now u&s;ed, is truly childi&s;h; as is the Roman armour, and every circum&s;tance not be|longing to real life. Want of genius is the only plea an arti&s;t can offer for the &s;tupid prac|tice of following models at the expence of nature.</P>
<P>On the rever&s;e, the poor pre&s;entation of the arms of a country may be con&s;idered as a proof that Europe wants yet &s;ome centuries of eloping from barbari&s;m. Of all po&s;&s;ible rever&s;es this mu&s;t be allowed the mo&s;t Gothic, and empty of all thought or de&s;ign. Room for the highe&s;t elegance ought to be given upon the rever&s;es of coin, and objects of delight and in&s;truction delineated.</P>
<P>The legends ought always to be in the lan|guage of the country where the coin is &s;truck; for the money is made for it, and not for &s;o|reign
<PB N="223" REF="263">nations; and every inhabitant ought to be enabled to read the legends of the coin, which is made for him, and every day pa&s;&s;es thro his hands. It is &s;urprizing that, when the &s;cripture was given in Engli&s;h, the coin was not likewi&s;e tran&s;lated: but the night of ignorance drops at once; while it is with many a long and arduous &s;truggle that even the dawn of &s;cience appears.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing, for the &s;ake of a reverie, an alte|ration in the Briti&s;h coin upon the&s;e principles, the obver&s;e might thro-out, as at pre&s;ent, con|tain the king's portrait, but without armour, or laurel crown, till he wears them. Around would run the illu&s;trious title, GEORGE III. KING OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND: the other titles, of which the initials cut &s;o auk|ward a figure upon the rever&s;e of our gold and &s;ilver, might be left out of the coin without in|convenience.</P>
<P>But the rever&s;es, if hi&s;torical events are not allowed, in imitation of the Roman, &s;hould be varied, in every &s;pecies, &s;omething in this way. The guinea might pre&s;ent a figure of Liberty, as the mo&s;t precious of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and worthy of the analogy of gold; the legend might be, THE GUARDIAN OF BRITAIN. On the half-guinea, &s;uppo&s;e an image of Fortitude, THE GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY. The crown-piece might bear Liberty, Agriculture, and
<PB N="224" REF="264">Commerce, UNITED TO BLESS: the half-crown, the king, a peer, and a commoner, emblematic of our happy con&s;titution, with the legend, UNITED TO PROTECT. The &s;hilling might be charged with a &s;hip of war conveying a mer|chant ve&s;&s;el, WEALTH AND POWER: the &s;ix|pence with an oak in a &s;torm, STRONGER FROM THE TEMPEST. The halfpenny may remain as it is, with regard to the impre&s;&s;ion, only doubling the &s;ize of the coin; the Britannia &s;hould hold a trident in her right hand, and let the other recline upon the helm of a &s;hip, in|&s;tead of holding both aloft, with impertinent articles in each, a po&s;ture very Gothic, and un|known to the ancients. What is the meaning of her long &s;pear? What of her olive branch, with which &s;he &s;its, like an old lady in a Gothic picture with a flower in her hand? The far|thing, of the &s;ize of the pre&s;ent halfpenny, might pre&s;ent an hu&s;bandman &s;owing, with this legend, BY INDUSTRY SMALL THINGS GROW GREAT.</P>
<P>But any effectual improvement of our coin|age mu&s;t be left till GOD help us; together with the more important improvements of the police of London, of our wa&s;te lands, and of parliamentary repre&s;entation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXI.</HI> Rarity of &s;ome ancient and modern Coins.</HEAD>
<P>FROM different cau&s;es &s;everal coins, ancient and modern, are very &s;eldom to be met with, and in con&s;equence bear high value; &s;uch are called Rare Coins. This rarity is con&s;idered by medalli&s;ts as having four or five degrees, beginning with &s;uch coins as are nei|ther rare nor common, and terminating at the &s;uperlative degree of unique.</P>
<P>The rarity of ancient medallions, and of modern medals, need not be con&s;idered; for &s;uch pieces are con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;arily rare, and a few exceptions do not injure the general rule.</P>
<PB N="226" REF="266">
<P>It mu&s;t occur that the prime cau&s;e of the rarity of coins bearing any particular impre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be owing to the few that were &s;truck with that impre&s;&s;ion, or their being called in, and i&s;&s;ued from the mint in another form. The fir&s;t is the ca&s;e with the copper of Otho and gold of Pe&s;cennius Niger, the latter with the coinage of Caligula; tho this la&s;t is not of &s;in|gular rarity, which &s;hews that even the power of the Roman &s;enate could not annihilate an e&s;tabli&s;hed money, and that the fir&s;t cau&s;e of rarity, ari&s;ing from the &s;mall quantity origi|nally &s;truck, ought to be regarded as the principal.</P>
<P>In the ancient cities this rarity mu&s;t have ari&s;en from the poverty, or &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;tate, and con&s;equent little u&s;e of the mint, and deficience of native currency. The &s;carcene&s;s of ancient regal and imperial coins owes its &s;ource, principally, to the &s;hortne&s;s of the reign, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to no mintage taking place during that reign, as money &s;uper-abounded before. From the la&s;t cau&s;e we all know how rare a &s;hilling of our pre&s;ent king is and may ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imilate this ca&s;e to the an|cient. Shortne&s;s of reign indeed does not al|ways operate; for the coins of Harold II, who reigned but a year, are very common, while tho&s;e of Richard I, who reigned ten years, are almo&s;t unique.</P>
<PB N="227" REF="267">
<P>Sometimes coins, formerly e&s;teemed almo&s;t &s;ingular, will, in later times, lo&s;e that rarity, and become much more common. This is owing to the high price given, which tempts many of the holders to bring them to market; but chiefly to hoards being found. The fir&s;t was the ca&s;e with the farthings of Queen Ann, &s;ome of which, formerly &s;old at five guineas, would not now bring five &s;hillings; the latter with the coins of Cnute, or Canute, king of England, which were very rare till a large hoard of them was di&s;covered in the Orkneys. Owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e of parcels being di&s;|covered, very many coins, of all denominations, lo&s;e their rarity; and perhaps, after the period of di&s;per&s;ion of &s;uch parcels, re&s;ume it: and &s;ome common coins become rare from the very neglect of them.</P>

<P>Of the Roman imperial coins very little need be &s;aid, as a particular e&s;timate of their rarity will be found, at much length, in the Appendix. The rea&s;on of the &s;carcity of Otho in bra&s;s, and his not occurring at all on coins &s;truck at Rome of that metal, is, that the &s;e|nate, as has already been told in a former &s;ection, had the power of &s;triking the bra&s;s money, and it had never declared for Otho, but waited to &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t be|tween him and Vitellius.

<PB N="230" REF="270">the Greek imperial coins, in point of likene&s;s.

Latin coins of Otho in bra&s;s, which have figures on the rever&s;e, are infallibly fal&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In mentioning the rarity of modern coins, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e of Great Britain and Ireland only; and indeed, as it is propo&s;ed to give illu&s;trations upon the Engli&s;h likewi&s;e, in the Appendix, little or nothing need be &s;aid here. Only, as that account of the rarity of Engli&s;h coins, which is chiefly drawn from Mr. Snelling's Works, and Dr. Gifford's Po&s;t&s;cript to Folkes's Tables, will begin at William the Conqueror, it may be proper to &s;ay &s;omething of preced|ing reigns. The heptarchic coins are mo&s;tly rare, &s;ave the &s;tycas, which are very common. Of kings of all England, the money of Alfred, bearing his bu&s;t, is rather &s;carce; his other coin is common. The coins of Hardyknute are very &s;carce; and it was even denied that they exi&s;ted, &s;o as to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of Knute; but there are no le&s;s than

<P>THE gain upon forging imitations of an|cient coins being &s;o immen&s;e, it is no wonder that this &s;pecies of impo&s;ition has been much cultivated. Re&s;tricted by the laws of no country; and far from being con&s;idered as a crime, but, on the contrary, regarded as an exertion of ma&s;terly &s;kill in their profe&s;&s;ion, by the mo&s;t eminent modern arti&s;ts, this kind of forgery, which aro&s;e at the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, has &s;pread, and continues to &s;pread to an amazing degree.</P>
<P>It were unnece&s;&s;ary here to mention &s;everal medals, of which the forgery is &s;o apparent
<PB N="234" REF="274">that he mu&s;t be a novice indeed upon whom they impo&s;e. Such are tho&s;e of Priam BA&Sgr;I&Lgr;EO&Sgr; &Pgr;PIAMO&Ugr;, with a view of Troy TPOIA, upon the rever&s;e; tho&s;e of Aeneas Cicero; and Cae&s;ar, VENI, VIDI, VICI; with &s;everal others of the &s;ame &s;tamp. Of this kind is that of the emperor Heraclius likewi&s;e, with Greek and Latin &s;entences, repre&s;enting tha$ prince &s;troking his beard; with a chariot o$ the rever&s;e.

<P>It is from other arti&s;ts, and other productions that any danger of deceit ari&s;es. And there i$ no wonder that even the &s;kilful are mi&s;led b$ &s;uch arti&s;ts as have u&s;ed this trade; for among them appear the names of Victor Gambello$ Giovani del Cavino, called THE PADUAN, an$ his &s;on; Ale&s;&s;andro Ba&s;&s;iano, likewi&s;e of Padua$ Benvenuto Cellini, Ale&s;&s;andro Greco, Leo Are|tino, Jacobo da Trezzo, Federigo Bonzagna and Giovani Jacopo, his brother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e preceding this mark are all mentioned by Vico, wh$ wrote in 1548.</NOTE>; Seba&s;tian$ Plumbo, Valerio de Vicenza, Gorlaeus, a Ger|man, Carteron, of Holland, and others; all, o$ mo&s;t of them, of the &s;ixteenth century; and Ca|vino, THE PADUAN, who is the mo&s;t famous, o$
<PB N="235" REF="275">the beginning of it, if I am not mi&s;taken. The forgeries of Cavino are held in no little e&s;teem, being of wonderful execution. His, and tho&s;e of Carteron, are the mo&s;t numerous; many of the other arti&s;ts here mentioned not having forged above two or three coins. Later forgers were Dervieu of Florence, who confined him&s;elf to medallions; and Cogornier, who gave coins of the thirty tyrants in &s;mall bra&s;s.</P>
<P>The chief part of the forgeries of Greek me|dals, which have come to my knowledge, are of the fir&s;t mentioned, and very gro&s;s, kind; repre&s;enting per&s;ons who could never appear upon coin, &s;uch as Priam, Aeneas, Plato, Alci|biades, Artemi&s;ia, and others. The real Greek coins were very little known, or valued, till the works of Goltzius appeared, which were hap|pily po&s;terior to the aera of the grand forgers. Why later forgers have &s;eldom thought of counterfeiting them, cannot ea&s;ily be accounted for, if it is not owing to the ma&s;terly workman|&s;hip of the originals, which &s;ets all imitation at defiance. Forgeries, however, of mo&s;t ancient coins may be met with, and of the Greek among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is in the Roman medals that this impo&s;i|tion reigns to an amazing degree. But the reader mu&s;t beware of looking upon all for|geries in the more precious metals as modern. On the contrary, many pieces are of ancient
<PB N="236" REF="276">forgers of the public money; and are often more e&s;teemed than the genuine coins, becau&s;e plated, or otherwi&s;e executed, in a way that no modern forgers could attain to; and of con&s;e|quence bearing intrin&s;ic marks of antiquity. The ancients them&s;elves held coins ingeniou&s;ly counterfeited in &s;uch high e&s;teem, that P$iny informs us many true denarii were often give$ for one fal&s;e one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fal&s;i denarii &s;pectatur exemplar; pluribu&s;que veris denarii$ adulterinus emitur. Plin. Hi&s;t Nat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Even of the Roman con&s;ular coins not very many have ever been forged. The celebrated &s;ilver denarius of Brutus with the cap of liberty and two daggers, is the chief in&s;tance of a con|&s;ular coin of which a counterfeit is cu$$nt. But it is ea&s;ily rejected by this mark: in the true coin the cap of liberty is below the guard, or hilt, of the daggers; in the fal&s;e the top of it ri&s;es above that hilt.</P>
<P>It is in the grande&s;t &s;eries in the world, the imperial &s;eries of Rome, that modern forgery has almo&s;t univer&s;al prevalence: and rules for di&s;cerning it &s;hall pre&s;ently be laid down from the e&s;&s;ay of M. Beauvais, the late&s;t given on$ the &s;ubject<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">La maniere de di&s;cerner les medailles antiques de celles qu$ &s;ont contrefaites, 4to, Paris, 1739.

Vico, whom Beauvais copies, but does not mention, is a far &s;u|petior writer on the point, tho not &s;o general.</NOTE>. It may be premi&s;ed that the de|ception
<PB N="237" REF="277">of forgery at fir&s;t extended to the mo&s;t eminent writers, for William du Choul, who wrote more than two hundred years ago, cau&s;ed to be engraved in his treati&s;e, On the religion of the ancient Romans, two medals of Agrip|pa; one of great bra&s;s, on the rever&s;e of which is the Pantheon: and another of &s;ilver, with Neptune in his car drawn by two &s;ea-hor&s;es, with this legend AEQVORIS HIC OMNIPOTENS. Both of the&s;e medals were undoubtedly fal&s;e. Antony Le Pois, who lived at the &s;ame time, produces different medals of certain fal&s;ity; &s;uch as a Scipio Africanus; the Aelian bridge on a rever&s;e of Hadrian; and a Pe&s;cennius Ni|ger of gold; then undi&s;covered, tho &s;ince found, and to be &s;een in the French king's cabi|net. The&s;e in&s;tances mu&s;t convince us that, almo&s;t as &s;oon as a ta&s;te for coins began to &s;pread among the curious, the trade of impo&s;i|tion aro&s;e.</P>

They are &s;o numerous, that a complete &s;eries of imperial medals, of almo&s;t every metal and &s;ize, may be formed of them alone; nay, a numerous collection of me|dallions them&s;elves.

The &s;ides are filed, which is di&s;coverable by the lea&s;t attention; or they are too much &s;moothed by art, or bear marks of a &s;mall hammer. 6. They are always very circular, which the an|cient are not, e&s;pecially after Trajan<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho M. Beauvais gives the&s;e &s;ix marks here, yet &s;ome of them more properly refer to the two following cla&s;&s;es: a few ob&s;ervations &s;hall therefore be added. 1. The coins and me|dallions of the Paduan are &s;eldom thinner than the ancient, but tho&s;e of inferior forgers are almo&s;t always. 2. The Paduan forgeries very &s;eldom appear as worn, or damaged, but the others very frequently, e&s;pecially in the rever&s;e, and legend of the re|ver&s;e, which &s;ometimes, as in many forged Othos, appear as half con&s;umed by time. 3. The letters in coins ca&s;t in molds taken from the antique have the very rudene&s;s of antiquity. 4. Fal&s;e varni&s;h is either light green or black, and &s;hines too much or too little. 5. The &s;ides of forged coins are often quite &s;mooth, and undi&s;cernable from the ancient; to &s;mooth them indeed requires little or no art. 6. Counterfeit medals are very often of as irregular a form as the real; tho tho&s;e of the Pa|duan are generally circular: fal&s;e coins have often little &s;ec|tions cut off, and other perfect imitations of the ancient. One great di&s;tinction of ca&s;t coins is, that the letters do not go &s;harp down to the field of the medal, but appear as molting into it; &s;o that they have no fixed outline, and one cannot &s;ee to their bottom, &s;o to &s;peak. Add to this, that the minute angles of the letters and drapery, &amp;c. of the figures are commonly filled up in ca&s;t coins, and have not the &s;harpne&s;s of the genuine; and where the figures and letters are faint the coin is greatly to be &s;u&s;pected.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Hence it may be ob&s;erved, once for all, that the letters of the legend form the very &s;ure&s;t te&s;t of medals, tho&s;e of modern medals being always modern, while the ancient have many rude peculiarities, &s;uch as the M always in this form M, and not with &s;traight &s;trokes; which, with many other little differences, con&s;titutes an infallible di&s;tinction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letters form the grand criterion of medals, the modem being uniform, the ancient very rude.

However, mo&s;t of the in&s;tructions given for the fir&s;t cla&s;s likewi&s;e avail in this, with another di&s;tinction, which is, that coins of this cla&s;s are always much lighter than true medals of their &s;ize, becau&s;e fire rare|fies the melted metal, while that which is &s;truck is conden&s;ed, and becomes of con&s;equence more weighty.</P>

The art exerted in this cla&s;s is a&s;toni&s;hing; and a connoi&s;&s;eur is apt the le&s;s to &s;u&s;pect it, as the coins them&s;elves are in fact ancient. The acute minds of the Italian arti&s;ts exerted them&s;elves in this way, when the other kinds of forgeries became common and known. With graving tools they alter the portraits, the rever&s;es, the in&s;criptions them&s;elves, in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner.

Tho this is &s;ometimes done with an artifice almo&s;t miraculous, yet mo&s;t commonly the characters &s;traggle, are di&s;united, and not in a line.</P>
<P>Medals of this cla&s;s are often met with of which the obver&s;e has not been touched, but the rever&s;e made hollow, then filled with ma&s;|tic of the colour of the coin, which is engraved with &s;uch device and legend as the arti&s;t knew was uncommon, and would bear a great price.</P>
<P>Others are only retouched in &s;ome minute particulars, which however very much dimini&s;h the value of the coin.</P>
<P>Again&s;t all the&s;e arts &s;evere &s;crutiny mu&s;t be u&s;ed by the purcha&s;er upon the medal it&s;elf and the inve&s;tigation and opinion of eminent antiquaries had upon its being altered, or ge|nuine as it i&s;&s;ued from the mint.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CLASS V.</HI> Medals impre&s;&s;ed with new Devices, or &s;oldered.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t article of this cla&s;s concerns tho&s;e medals of which the real rever&s;es have been totally filed off, and new ones impre&s;&s;ed by dint of a dye and the hammer. This is done by putting the face or obver&s;e, whichever is not touched, upon different folds of pa&s;teboard, and then applying the dye, and impre&s;&s;ing it with &s;trokes of an hammer.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of &s;uch coins of them&s;elves betray their fal&s;ity; the devices and in&s;criptions being &s;uch as are known not to exi&s;t upon real medals. Such as the Pons Aelius on the rever&s;e of Ha|drian; the Expeditio Judaica of the &s;ame em|peror; and the like.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, another infallible token is the difference, more or le&s;s, in the fabrication of the face and of the new rever&s;e. This an eye of any &s;kill will always di&s;cern at fir&s;t glance.</P>
<P><HI>Soldered</HI> medals are tho&s;e which con&s;i&s;t of two halves belonging to different medals that are &s;awed thro, and then joined with &s;older. This deceit is common in &s;ilver and in bra&s;s. They will take an Antoninus, for example, and &s;aw off the rever&s;e, then &s;older to the obver&s;e a Fau&s;tina which they have treated in like
<PB N="246" REF="286">manner. This makes a medal which will, from an unknowing purcha&s;er, bring an hundred times the price of the two coins which com|po&s;e it. When the deceit is u&s;ed in bra&s;s coins, they take care that the two medals be of one hue; tho indeed &s;ome pretenders in this way &s;ometimes &s;older copper and bra&s;s together, which at once reveals the di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Medals which have a portrait on each &s;ide, and which are always valuable, are the mo&s;t liable to &s;u&s;picion of this fraud.</P>
<P>To a very nice eye the minute ring of the &s;older is always vi&s;ible; and upon in&s;erting a graver the fabrication falls in halves.</P>
<P>Rever&s;es are likewi&s;e often treated in this way, by being &s;oldered to faces not originally connected with them. Pere Jobert tells us of a Domitian, with the Amphitheatre, a rever&s;e of Titus, thus glewed to it: and many others of the like kind ari&s;e to this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The temple of Janus, upon Nero's medals, gives in&s;tance $word$ another art: that of the middle bra&s;s being &s;ometimes taken o$ and in&s;erted into a cavity made in the rever&s;e of a large bra$ coin of that prince.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It may be worth while to ob&s;erve here, that many rever&s;es in coins of the lower empire are &s;o unconnected with their obver&s;es, that they in&s;pire a mi&s;taken &s;u&s;picion of this forgery. The&s;e occur e&s;pecially after the days of Gal|lienus,
<PB N="247" REF="287">when numerous u&s;urpers walked over the tragic &s;cene of empire &s;o fa&s;t that it was difficult to catch their features. The coiners had &s;carcely time to engrave a portrait of the emperor, much le&s;s to make his medal an ap|propriated monument of adulation. Hence PACATOR ORBIS on a rever&s;e of Marius, who reigned only three days: and innumerable others, which are owing to the coiners &s;tamp|ing the medals of the&s;e fugitive &s;overeigns with rever&s;es which they had ready fabricated for &s;ome preceding monarch who&s;e reign was at lea&s;t of &s;ufficient duration to afford time for engraving a rever&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CLASS VI.</HI> Counterfeit Medals which have Clefts, or which are plated.</HEAD>
<P>Many true medals are &s;plit on the &s;ides, owing to the ancient method of &s;triking them with repeated &s;trokes of a hammer. As the&s;e clefts were regarded as infallible marks of an|tiquity, tho&s;e arti&s;ts who wi&s;h to impo&s;e on the collector of medals in every &s;hape readily &s;et them&s;elves to imitate them. This they did by filing an incifion upon the margin of the coin as much re&s;embling the ca&s;ual clefts as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<PB N="248" REF="288">
<P>But this flaw is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from the ca&s;ual by its being wide at the extremity, and going &s;traight in, ending at once in a point, and not with tho&s;e almo&s;t imperceptible fila|ments which terminate the genuine. Add to this, that the two &s;ides of an antique cleft cor|re&s;pond to each other by mutual chinks and protuberances, which are inimitable by the file, &s;o that the di&s;tinction is by no means a ta&s;k of difficulty. If the filaments of the real clefts are attempied to be imitated, a &s;mall needle will ea&s;ily decide of their depth and reality.</P>
<P>Such medals as are <HI>plated,</HI> and in fact forged in ancient times, were believed to be incapable of modern imitation, and very much tru&s;ted to till of late years, when &s;ome ingenious rogues thought of piercing fal&s;e medals of &s;ilver with a red-hot needle, which gave a blackne&s;s to the in&s;ide of the coin, and made it appear plated to an injudicious eye. This fraud is ea&s;ily di&s;|tingui&s;hed by &s;craping the &s;ide of the medal.</P>
<P>This &s;ection &s;hall be concluded, after ob|&s;erving, that tho&s;e rules laid down by M. Beau|vais, tho very proper, will yet be of little &s;er|vice without a real and practical knowledge of coins. This is only to be acquired by &s;eeing a great number, and comparing the forged with the genuine. It cannot therefore be too
<PB N="249" REF="289">much recommended to the young connoi&s;&s;eur, who wi&s;hes to acquire knowledge in this way, to vi&s;it all the &s;ales and cabinets he can, and to look upon all ancient medals with a very mi|cro&s;copic eye. By the&s;e means only is to be acquired that ready knowledge which enables, at fir&s;t glance, to pronounce upon a forgery, however ingenious. Nor let the &s;cience of me|dals be from this concluded to be uncertain, for no knowledge is more certain and immedi|ate when it is properly &s;tudied by examination of the real objects. A man who buys coins, tru&s;ting merely to his theoretic peru&s;al of me|dallic books, will find him&s;elf woefully mi&s;|taken. He ought to &s;tudy coins fir&s;t, where only they can be &s;tudied, in them&s;elves. Nor can it be matter of wonder, or implication of caprice, that a medalli&s;t of &s;kill &s;hould, at one perception, pronounce upon the veracity or fal&s;hood of a medal; for the powers of the hu|man eye, employed in certain lines of &s;cience, are amazing. Hence a &s;tudent can di&s;tingui&s;h a book among a thou&s;and &s;imilar, and quite alike to every other eye: hence a &s;hepherd can di&s;cern and characterize every ram and ewe of his flock, tho they &s;trike every body el&s;e as uniformity it&s;elf: hence a &s;ailor can know of what country a ve&s;&s;el is at an immen&s;e di&s;|tance: hence any one knows his friend, tho in
<PB N="250" REF="290">a croud at the further end of a &s;treet, where any marks of him were unattainable to an in|different &s;pectator: hence the medalli&s;t can in an in&s;tant &s;ay, "this is a fal&s;e coin, and this a true," tho to other people no di&s;tinction be perceivable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXIII.</HI> Directions for forming Cabinets.</HEAD>
<P>CABINETS of medals may be divided into three di&s;tinct &s;izes: I. The large and complete cabinet; containing, or meant to contain, every i&s;&s;ue of the mint, in every age, and of every country. This, it may ea&s;ily be &s;een, requires a va&s;t expence, and few but kings ought to attempt it. The King of France has the mo&s;t opulent cabinet of this kind in exi&s;t|ence, and which is calculated to have co&s;t, &s;ince its in&s;titution till now, when arrived at a point of perfection which it can but little ex|ceed, near 100,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> &s;terling. That of Dr. Hunter is perhaps one of the be&s;t private cabi|nets ever formed in this &s;tyle, and is thought
<PB N="252" REF="292">to have co&s;t about 15,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>&mdash;II. The &s;maller cabinet; the collector of which, confining him|&s;elf to the forming of five or &s;ix &s;equences, as of middle and &s;mall Roman bra&s;s only, of Engli&s;h pennies, or of groats, or any other par|ticular &s;erie&s;es, con&s;iders other medals as out of his line of collecting, tho he may purcha&s;e a few de&s;olate ones, or belonging to other &s;ets, to give variety to his &s;election. Such a cabi|net may infer an expence of from 200<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> or 300<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to 1000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>&mdash;III. The lea&s;t cabinet, or ca&s;ket of medals, which may include all little collections of coins, from a hundred to a thou&s;and or two. In this not above a &s;equence or two can well be formed; but the <HI>amateur</HI> plea&s;es his fancy by the mi&s;cellaneous in&s;ertion of any article which curio&s;ity, or other motives, may incline him to procure. The expence, of con&s;equence, depends entirely upon the plea&s;ure of the pro|prietor.</P>
<P>To begin with the large and complete ca|binet, it is to be ob&s;erved that, in the grand divi&s;ion of ancient coins, as di&s;tinct from the modern, the Greek medals, of every denomina|tion, can never be arranged by the metals, or &s;izes, like the Roman; for no &s;eries of any one metal, or &s;ize, can be found of this cla&s;s in the mo&s;t opulent cabinet. For this rea&s;on the civic coins, of all metals and &s;izes, are dige&s;ted in alphabetical order, and the monarchic in
<PB N="253" REF="293">chronological. The &s;ame rule is to be ob|&s;erved in the Roman con&s;ular medals, which are arranged in alphabetical &s;eries of the fami|lies, like tho&s;e of the Greek cities. Indeed, of all ancient coins, the Roman imperial &s;eries is the only one admitting of being dige&s;ted in &s;izes and metals. And even from it mu&s;t be excepted the <HI>quinarii,</HI> or very &s;malle&s;t coins; which are &s;o &s;carce that the only &s;equence of this kind in the world is that belonging to the King of Spain, which was formed by a mo&s;t &s;kilful French medalli&s;t, and con&s;i&s;ts of all the metals.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the pro|per divi&s;ions of a grand and complete cabinet &s;hall next be &s;tated; which, in the part allotted to ancient coins, may run thus:</P>
<P N="1">I. The coins of cities and of free &s;tates, in alphabetical order.</P>
<P N="2">II. Kings in chronological &s;eries, both as to foundation of empire and &s;eniority of reign.</P>
<P N="3">III. Heroes, heroines, and founders of em|pires, and of cities.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Other illu&s;trious men and women.</P>
<P N="5">V. Roman <HI>a&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. Coins of families, commonly called Con&s;ular.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Imperial medallions.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Imperial gold.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Imperial <HI>quinarii,</HI> of all metals.</P>
<PB N="254" REF="294">
<P N="10">X. Imperial &s;ilver.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Imperial fir&s;t bra&s;s.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Second bra&s;s.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Third bra&s;s.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Colonial coins, which are all of bra&s;s.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Greek cities under the emperors, of all metals and &s;izes. In a &s;maller cabinet they may be put with the Roman, according to their metal and &s;ize.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Egyptian coins &s;truck under the Ro|man emperors, of all metals and &s;izes. They are mo&s;tly of a ba&s;e metal, called by the French writers <HI>potin,</HI> being a kind of pot-metal, or brittle bra&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is compo&s;ed of copper, lead, and tin, with &s;ometimes a fifth, and oftener a tenth, or twelfth part &s;ilver, to make it brit|tle; for, according to my information, without &s;ilver it would not be brittle at all. The Egyptian coins are ca&s;t in molds, and are very thick: perhaps this metal was u&s;ed becau&s;e be&s;t for ca&s;ting. It is worth about 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> a pound weight.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. <HI>Contorniati,</HI> or ticket-medals.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Coins of Gothic princes, &amp;c. in&s;crib|ed with Roman characters.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. Coins of Southern nations, u&s;ing un|known alphabets; as the Per&s;ian, Punic, Etru&s;|can, Spani&s;h.</P>
<P N="20">XX. Coins of Northern nations, u&s;ing un|known characters; as the Runic and German.</P>
<P>In the Modern Part no &s;eries can be formed of copper that will go back above two centu|ries;
<PB N="255" REF="295">but &s;equences of gold and of &s;ilver may be arranged of all the different empires, king|doms, and &s;tates, &s;o far as their &s;everal coinages will allow. Tho&s;e of England and France will be the mo&s;t perfect. Modern &s;ilver is com|monly arranged in three &s;equences: the dollar-&s;ize, the &s;hilling-&s;ize, and the groat-&s;ize. The medals of each modern country ought of cour&s;e to be &s;eparated, tho it is be&s;t to arrange each &s;et in chronological order, let their &s;ize or me|tal be what they will. It may be remarked here that our modern medals, of the &s;ize of a tea-&s;aucer, are only &s;o many monuments of Gothici&s;m. The ancient medallions are almo&s;t univer&s;ally but little larger than our crown-piece, tho three or four of them may extend to two inches diameter, but very many modern medals to four inches and more. A large me|dal always declares an ignorant prince, or an ignorant arti&s;t. Into the &s;ize of a crown-piece the ancients threw more miracles in this way than will ever appear on the&s;e mon&s;trous pro|ductions; but, as Zeuxis &s;aid to his &s;cholar, who had daubed a paltry de&s;ign with florid colours, <Q>&startq;If thou ha&s;t not made it beautiful, thou ha&s;t &endq;made it rich,</Q> &s;o it may be &s;aid to tho&s;e enor|mous arti&s;ts, with this addition, that a pair of &s;cales give the mo&s;t ju&s;t e&s;timate of their works.</P>
<P>The formation of a cabinet of the Second Cla&s;s next demands our attention. The direc|tions
<PB N="256" REF="296">for the former will likewi&s;e apply to this, &s;o far as it is meant to go. But as the Smaller Cabinet only includes a few complete &s;equences, either of ancient or modern coins, &s;ome more particular in&s;tructions may be given. If, for in&s;tance, the collector means to form a &s;eries of the Roman large bra&s;s, he will find the coins of four or five emperors &s;o &s;carce as not to be at|tainable in that &s;eries, even at any price. He mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;upply their places with the middle bra&s;s, as is allowed with regard to Otho even in the be&s;t cabinets, there not being above three coins of that emperor, in large bra&s;s, known in the world; whereas, of the middle bra&s;s, two or three hundred may exi&s;t. If this is allowed in one in&s;tance, why not in others? Why may not Tiberius, or Pertinax, appear in the middle bra&s;s, as well as Otho? I confe&s;s I can &s;ee no rea&s;on for the collector putting him&s;elf to a needle&s;s expence, which might be laid out in articles of more importance to his cabinet, merely that a &s;eries may receive a fini|cal completion, which is of no nece&s;&s;ity but it the eyes of vi&s;ionaries. This will appear the more ju&s;t when we con&s;ider th$t it is not by the &s;ize of the coin only that $word$, even th$ mo&s;t rigid in the &s;uper&s;tition of their fanta&s;ti$ &s;cience, decide whether it belongs to the fir&s;t or &s;econd bra&s;s, but by that of the head which it bears. The conclu&s;ion to be drawn from
<PB N="257" REF="297">the&s;e arguments is, that, in cabinets of the &s;e|cond cla&s;s, the collector may mingle the middle with the large bra&s;s, as he thinks proper: and in like manner the &s;mall with the middle; tho it will not be &s;o well to unite &s;uch di&s;propor|tionate &s;izes as the large and the &s;mall. In the &s;mall &s;equence, however, there can be no harm in his mixing gold, &s;ilver, and bra&s;s, as chance or curio&s;ity may lead him to purcha&s;e any of the&s;e metals. And tho your &s;tarched bigotted medalli&s;t may &s;neer, becau&s;e &s;uch a &s;equence would controvert his formal and narrow way of thinking, common &s;en&s;e will authori&s;e us to laugh at the pedant in our turn, and to pro|nounce &s;uch a &s;eries more various, rich, and in|tere&s;ting, than if the collector had only arranged one metal, and rejected a curious article becau&s;e he did not collect gold or &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Pedantry, in mo&s;t &s;ciences, is now held in ju&s;t contempt, but it yet reigns in the medallic line in a &s;upreme degree. Nor is this &s;urpriz|ing, when it is con&s;idered that the pedants them|&s;elves are the giver of their own &s;illy laws; for, excepting perhaps half a dozen in&s;tances, books upon this &s;ubject have only been written by men lo&s;t in the pedantry of numi&s;matic erudition.</P>
<P>In like manner, if, in the Modern Part of the Smaller Cabinet, any coin of a &s;eries is of high price, or of bad impre&s;&s;ion, there can be no im|propriety in putting another of the &s;ame reign,
<PB N="258" REF="298">which is cheaper, or better executed, tho of a different denomination, and a little larger &s;ize. In &s;hort, the collector has no rules, but in the Greek cities and Roman families to ob&s;erve alphabetical order, and chronology in every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t a &s;election of a ca&s;ket of medals no directions can be given, fancy being the only law. The arrangement may, however, be ma|naged by the ob&s;ervations already made upon the two higher de&s;criptions.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXIV.</HI> Pre&s;ent Prices of Medals.</HEAD>
<P>THE current value of coins is &s;ubject to a few fluctuations, ari&s;ing from the ta&s;te for medals being more, or le&s;s, prevalent at parti|cular periods, and other cau&s;es. Yet, upon the whole, the pre&s;ent prices have taken place for a century or more, except in &s;ome in&s;tances; and may therefore be con&s;idered as permanent. They are certainly high enough in general; and, if any alteration takes place, it may &s;afely be imagined that it will be in favor of the collector.</P>
<P>The gold coins of Greek cities are mo&s;tly very &s;mall; and not above a dozen &s;tates have yet been found in gold: of which only Carthage, Cyrene, and Syracu&s;e, are rather common, and worth but double their intrin&s;ic value. The other gold civic coins are worth from 3<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to 30<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> The king, who has about 400 gold coins, lately pro|cured two <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of Athens before unknown, for that in the Mu&s;eum is &s;u&s;pected: of the&s;e the queen got one for Dr. Hunter, and they are
<PB N="260" REF="300">the only two gold coins of Athens known to exi&s;t. Dr. Hunter's, if &s;old, might bring the very highe&s;t price a coin can bear.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver coins of Greek cities are many of them extremely &s;carce. The common ones are priced according to their &s;ize, for the large&s;t are always the rare&s;t. Tho&s;e of Syracu&s;e, Dyrra|chium, Ma&s;&s;ilia, Athens, and a few other &s;tates are common: drachms, and le&s;&s;er &s;izes, may bring 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> each: didrachms, and tridrachms, from 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> according to beauty and pre|&s;ervation.

<P>Of the copper civic medals of Greece many are common. They are almo&s;t all of tho&s;e &s;izes which are called &s;mall bra&s;s in the Roman &s;eries: the middle &s;ize is &s;carce. The large&s;t, prior to the Roman emperors, is of extreme &s;carcity. The <HI>obolus,</HI> arranged with copper in a former &s;ection, belongs to the
<PB N="261" REF="301">Greek imperial coins, with its half, or the he|miobolium; for had they been current coins of ancient Greece in copper, as many of them mu&s;t have reached us as of the Roman large bra&s;s; whereas not above one or two &s;olitary ones will appear in a large &s;eries, and they of the Roman imperial times. We mu&s;t conclude from this that the obolus, or &s;ixth of a drachm, and the hemiobolium, or its twelfth, were al|ways, in the better days of Greece, coined in &s;ilver; but, about the commencement of the Roman imperial times, were coined in copper, from the deficience of currency, ari&s;ing from the tributes impo&s;ed by the victors, and in|crea&s;e of the value of &s;ilver, as has been the ca&s;e in modern times. There can be little &s;cruple then in putting down the &s;ilver coins, now weighing about the &s;ixth of a drachm, or 10 &frac12; grains, as oboli, and tho&s;e about the twelfth, or 5 &frac12; grains, as hemiobolia. The weight is, however, often dimini&s;hed by time, or indeed at the very coinage, for many drachms under com|mon weight were i&s;&s;ued by different &s;tates, at different times. That there is not a va&s;t multi|tude extant of the&s;e &s;ilver oboli, and hemio|bolia, cannot be wondered at, when their ex|treme &s;mallne&s;s is con&s;idered; for to the &s;ame rea&s;on it is owing that &s;o few of the &s;ilver half|pence and farthings of our ancient kings are met with, tho certainly more current than their
<PB N="262" REF="302">pennies, and nearly as common as their pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;titutes of copper. The analogy of the mo|dern coinages of Europe likewi&s;e contributes very much to confirm this opinion, &s;ilver gra|dually increa&s;ing in value till the minute coin|ages can only appear in copper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the only oboli which occur in bra&s;s, previous to the time of Augu&s;tus, are tho&s;e of the later Ptolemies, with a head of Jupiter on one &s;ide, and an eagle on the other, BA&Sgr;I|&Lgr;EO&Sgr; &Pgr;TO&Lgr;EMEIO&Ugr;. Hemiobolia, nay, double and triple oboli, occur of this de&s;cription. Some medalli&s;ts call them weights, others medallions. Upon the mo&s;t diligent &s;crutiny of the whole ancient writers who have made the lea&s;t mention of the obolus, every one will be convinced that it, and its half, or the hemiobolium, were of &s;ilver, and not of copper, till the Roman empire prevailed over Greece. Hear Cel&s;us, who&s;e proof is po&s;i|tive: <Q>Unius deinde denarii pondus dividi a me in &s;ex parte$ &startq;id e&s;t, &s;ex &s;extulas; ut idem in &s;extula denarii habeam, quo$ &endq;Graeci habent in eo quem <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> appellant.</Q> This &s;hews th$ obolus to have been a &s;ixth of the drachm in weight likewi&s;e, a in value, con&s;equently not of bra&s;s, but &s;ilver; for a bra&s;s obolus would have weighed ten denarii, or drachms. Indeed, the ver$ name, <HI>chalcos,</HI> equivalent to the Roman <HI>as,</HI> or <HI>as,</HI> &s;hews that th$ was at fir&s;t the highe&s;t bra&s;s coin, and called <HI>the piece of bra&s;s,</HI> $word$ way of eminence. We mu&s;t, however, beware of confounding th$ <HI>obolus</HI> of ancient Greece with the <HI>obolus obaratus</HI> of Plautus, or th$ <HI>date obolum Beli&s;ar$o</HI> of the lower empire; in which, and $word$ in&s;tances, the <HI>obolus areus</HI> is u&s;ed to imply a piece of bra&s;s $word$ larger than the &s;ilver obolus; as the <HI>denarius areus</HI> was, in Aus$|lian's reign, a common term for &s;mall bra&s;s coins, of the &s;ize $ the &s;ilver denarius. So late as the &s;ourteenth century Henry K$$|ton u&s;es the term <HI>obolus</HI> for a <HI>bal&s;penny,</HI> telling us, that in 134 fir&s;t appeared the noble, the <HI>obolus,</HI> o$ halfpenny, and the $word$ o$ gold.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Greek cities in large bra&s;s are very rare, but bear no corre&s;ponding value, they and the
<PB N="263" REF="303">middle bra&s;s cla&s;&s;ing together, at about 2<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> a piece. The Grecian civic coins in &s;mall bra&s;s are very common of &s;everal &s;tates, bringing from 3<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> to 1<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>d,</HI></ABBR> according to their pre&s;erva|tion. Very many cities, however, of which not above one or two coins are known, and tho&s;e of bra&s;s, bring higher prices.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, in general, upon the coins of the Greek cities, that the want of a few cities is not thought to injure a &s;eries, as indeed new names are di&s;covered every dozen years, &s;o that no &s;equence can be perfect. To this it is owing, that the rarity of the Grecian civic coins is not much attended to.</P>
<P>The gold coins of the Greek princes like|wi&s;e admit the half and quarter drachm, with tho&s;e of the cities. The didrachms are, how|ever, the mo&s;t common in this metal; and mo&s;t denominations of no rarity in the coinage of Philip of Macedon, Alexander the Great, and Ly&s;imachus, bearing, in con&s;equence, but from 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> above the intrin&s;ic value. But the other princes are rare, and bring from 3<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to 30<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a piece.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ilver monarchic money, with Gre|cian legends, the tetradrachms, which are the deare&s;t, &s;ell from 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 50<ABBR><HI>s,</HI></ABBR> nay perhaps a few very rare from 3<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to 30<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> The drachms may bring half the&s;e prices; the other denomina|tions in proportion.</P>
<PB N="264" REF="304">
<P>The copper coins of the Greek kings are, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, &s;carcer than the &s;ilver; and, like tho&s;e of the cities, are almo&s;t all of the &s;ize called &s;mall bra&s;s. They ought to bring a high price; but the metal, and &s;imilarity to the copper civic coins, which are common, keep their actual purcha&s;e very moderate, if the &s;eller is not well in&s;tructed, and the buyer able and willing to pay the price of rarity.</P>
<P>The Greek coins &s;truck under the Roman empire will all be &s;tated in the particular e&s;ti|mate of imperial coins, to be found in the Ap|pendix; which likewi&s;e leaves me but very few illu&s;trations to add upon the prices of Ro|man medals. A few cla&s;&s;es, however, mu&s;t be noticed, which do not fall into that plan.</P>
<P>Ancient Roman <HI>a&s;es,</HI> with their divi&s;ions ig|norantly enough termed weights<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The appellation of weights given to the large&s;t Roman coins ari&s;es from &s;trange ignorance. Roman weights are &s;een in lead, and &s;ometimes in bra&s;s; but they have only the knobs, marking their proportion to the pound weight, upon one &s;ide, with little <HI>fleurettes</HI> around, but without the &s;malle&s;t &s;hadow of bu&s;ts or le|gends, much lo&s;s of rever&s;es, the other &s;ide being &s;mooth and bare, that it may re&s;t in the &s;cale. Who ever heard of weights i&s;&s;ued from a mint, o$ globular, as the more ancient <HI>a&s;es</HI> are? The ab|&s;urdity is yet greater with regard to the large Greek bra&s;s, of one or two of the Ptolemies, kings of Egypt, &s;ome of which are of a &s;ize equal to the Roman a&s;es. Medalli&s;ts do not &s;eem to reflect that the Greek obolus was equal in value, as P$l$bius tells us, to near two <HI>a&s;es;</HI> and if &s;truck in bra&s;s, even in the late&s;t periods, mu&s;t weigh about two ounces, and if in elder periods a pound, or a pound and a half. In &s;hort, wherever a piece of ancient metal is &s;tamped on both &s;ides with bu&s;ts or figures, it may be laid down as a certain rule that it is a coin; but when marks of proportion of weight appear, with &s;light ornaments, upon one &s;ide only, in that ca&s;e, and that alone, it is to be regarded as a weight.</NOTE>, bring from 2<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 5<ABBR><HI>s,</HI></ABBR> according to the &s;ingularity of their devices.</P>
<PB N="265" REF="305">
<P>Con&s;ular gold coins are worth from 1<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to 5<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> The Pompey, with his &s;ons, 21<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and the two Bruti, 25<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> The &s;ilver rate univer&s;ally from 1<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 2<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>d,</HI></ABBR> &s;ave that with the cap of liberty and daggers, EID.

<P>Upon the Roman imperial coins it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, in general, that a few of many princes, who&s;e medals are numerous, may yet be rendered very precious from uncommon re|ver&s;es.

<P>The Scoti&s;h coins are on a par with the Eng|li&s;h, except that the gold &s;ell higher.

<HEAD><HI>N^o IV.</HI> An e&s;timate of the rarity of all the Coins of Roman Emperors, with their prices.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THE fir&s;t writer who &s;eems to have formed an idea of this e&s;timate was Savot, in his <HI>Di&s;|cours &s;ur les medailles,</HI> Paris, 1627, followed by Bau|delot, in his book <HI>De l'utilit&eacute; des voyages,</HI> Paris, 1686. The Baron Ezekiel Spanheim &s;ucceeded; a man of great di&s;tinction in life, and of no mean knowledge of medals. His manu&s;cript is extant in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, No 3879, of Mr. Ay&s;cough's Catalogue (not to be named without prai&s;e, as the be&s;t dige&s;ted ever yet offered to the public), and is entitled <HI>Numi&s;|mata Imperatoria, &s;ecundum varios raritatis gradus, per Ezekiel$m Spanhemium.</HI> He u&s;es no le&s;s than eight degrees of rarity, which is indeed a &s;uperfluous nicety, and his whole li&s;t is very full of mi&s;takes, whence it is in fact of infinitely more prejudice than utility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The next attempt of this kind was by a French writer of later period, and better information. It is annexed to the be&s;t, but now very rare, edition of La Science des Medailles, Paris 1739. 2 tomes, 12mo. and tho in&s;initely preferable to that of Spanheim, yet is by no means faultle&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>At length M. Beauvais, one of the fir&s;t medalli&s;ts of the age, &s;et about this nece&s;&s;ary work, and pro|duced
<PB N="291" REF="330">his <HI>Hi&s;toire Abreg&eacute;e des Empereurs Romains,</HI> Paris 1767. 3 tomes, 12mo. They however who advi&s;ed him to &s;well his e&s;timate, at fir&s;t his only in|tention, with &s;hort accounts of all the emperors and empre&s;&s;es, gave unnece&s;&s;ary coun&s;el, for the work were better without them. However this has no effect upon his valuation, which may be looked upon as the mo&s;t perfect that can well appear. He was the fir&s;t writer who added the prices, which is a va&s;t improvement: and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he had from M. Pellerin, and others, the fir&s;t medalli&s;ts in France, almo&s;t en&s;ures infallibility to his labours. which I have had before my eye, and almo&s;t copied, but with &s;everal additions and alterations, in every in&s;tance of the &s;ucceeding e&s;timate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>In France and Italy mo&s;t medals bear a higher price than in England: in other countries a lower. This is owing &s;olely to the va&s;t prevalence of this &s;tudy in Italy and France; and its being le&s;s general, and much le&s;s violent, here. The prices therefore fixt by M. Beauvais are in a few in&s;tances reduced one half, to accommodate them to this country: the&s;e alter|ations are however almo&s;t all authorized by atten|tion to &s;ales, and &s;ale catalogues, and other practical modes of information. Yet in very important ar|ticles, &s;uch as medallions, and coins of &s;upreme &s;carcity, no change could take place; becau&s;e if they cannot bring the high value here, the &s;eller may &s;end them with ea&s;e to Paris, &s;o that the price mu&s;t be the &s;ame, if they are bought in this country at all.

<ITEM>P. 151 Some of our fir&s;t medalli&s;ts inform me, that, upon ac|curate in&s;pection and examination, the two Engli&s;h pennies of Richard I. prove to be &s;purious. Mr. Folkes's Pables, and Snelling's View of the Silver Coinage, led me into this error; which is a proof among many how little the be&s;t medallic works are to be tru&s;ted. The&s;e pennies are thought to be the fabrications of a certain col|lector, notorious in this way, and who mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that to em|barra&s;s the path of any &s;cience with forgery and futility implies no infamy. In forgeries of antient coin the fiction is, perhaps, &s;ufficiently atoned by the va&s;t &s;kill required; and the arti&s;t may plau&s;ibly alledge, that his intention was not to deceive, but to excite his utmo&s;t power by an attempt to rival the antient ma&s;ters. But no po&s;&s;ible apology can be made for forging the rude money of former modern times. The crime is certainly greater than that which leads the common coiner to the gallows, ina&s;much as it is committed with more ea&s;e, and the profit is incomparably larger. The per&s;on above hinted at may therefore re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that, when his death &s;hall have rendered the mention of his name &s;afe and free from cruelty, not all his good qualities will prevent its being delivered to po&s;terity with perpetual contempt and obloquy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 154. One other gold penny of Henry III. is known, &s;o that the coin is not unique.</ITEM>

<ITEM>P. 192. I. 21. The Scoti&s;h coronation medal is very common in &s;ilver, and &s;ometimes ri&s;ibly bears the legend EX AVRO, &amp;c. in that metal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 203. Ever &s;ince Charles II. publi&s;hed the guinea, our gold coinage has been, and now is, only 22 carats fine and 2 alloy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 210, <HI>note. For</HI> Ramage's half-crown, <HI>read</HI> Blondeau's half-crown in very remarkable pre&s;ervation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 212. I. 24. The fir&s;t piece marked on the edge is a &s;ilver <HI>pied&s;ort</HI> of Charles IX. of France, dated 1573. The fir&s;t medal
<PB REF="365">is one in &s;ilver of George Frederic Marquis of Brandenburg, dated 1589: the legend on the edge of which la&s;t is, CONCORDIA RES PARVAE CRESCVNT, DISCORDIA RES MAXIMAE DILABVNTVR. G. F. M. B. SACRUM. 1589. Both the&s;e pieces are in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Miles, and have been in&s;pected by the author.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 260. Tridrachms are all very &s;carce, but not the more va|lued on account of their name: however, they may always cla&s;s with tetradrachms in price. Some civic tetradrachms, of exceed|ing rarity and pre&s;ervation, will bring from one to four guineas.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 268. The Iri&s;h white crown has been &s;old twice or thrice, and brought about 4<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 276. Good pennies of Henry I. or of Stephen, are worth 2<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> each. Delete the &s;entence with regard to Engli&s;h coins of Richard I.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 277. The pieces, called groats of Edward I. are all proofs; and it is dubious if they were meant for pieces of that name. It is al&s;o more likely that they belong to Edward II. or III.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 279. Medalli&s;ts a&s;&s;ert, that there are quarter florins of Ed|ward III. known, tho it &s;eems doubtful if they are not coins of Aquitain. They have a helmet on one &s;ide, with a field of fleurs-de-luce; and not above one or two have yet appeared. There are two other gold coinages of Edward III. preceding his 27th year: the la&s;t of which has 42 nobles to the pound weight. All the pieces of both coinages are of great rarity, and much higher value than here &s;tated.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 280. Of Richard III. there are only angels, and angelets; the fir&s;t bring but 3<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 3<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR>; the la&s;t 10<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to 20<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> The double &s;o|vereign of Henry VIII. is common: delete the words in his coin|age "being old &s;tandard."
