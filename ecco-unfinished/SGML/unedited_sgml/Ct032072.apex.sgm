<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not any dramatic entertain|ment more frequently performed on the theatre at Paris, than the Oracle of Mon&s;ieur St. Foix; an author, for delicacy, and purity of &s;tyle, allowed, by all good $udges, to be one of the be&s;t in the French language: and, to &s;ay the truth, the con&s;tant applau&s;e with which the Public have favoured this piece of his, ap|pears to be little le&s;s than what is ju&s;tly due to its merit; &s;ince nothing can be prettier than the idea on which it is founded; or more happily executed, than the character of the girl; in whom love, as the &s;imple production of Nat$re, is drawn in the mo&s;t lively and charming colours.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e circum&s;tances, I was always much &s;urpri&s;ed at the little &s;ucce&s;s it met with upon the Engli&s;h &s;tage. Mrs. Cibber's tran&s;la|tion of it was excellent; and the performance of that incomparable actre&s;s, in the fir&s;t repre&s;enta|tions, gave it additional lu&s;tre. But I imagine, the character of the Fairy, a legendary being, very different in England from what it is in France, threw upon it an air of childi&s;hne&s;s.
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
This, I hope, may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be reme|died by the introduction of a Magician: and the pre&s;ent ta&s;te of the town favouring the at|tempt; I thought, by the addition of mu&s;ic, to which the &s;ubject &s;eems peculiarly adapted; I might be able to render the whole a toy, very capable of affording an hour's amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>THE Oracle has already been twice put into an Engli&s;h dre&s;s; fir&s;t by an anonymous author, and afterwards by Mrs. Cibber. The former is a literal tran&s;lation; and, for that rea&s;on, very indifferent. The latter I &s;hould certainly have made u&s;e of upon this occa&s;ion; but I found, in con&s;equence of my plan, &s;uch curtailing and &s;o many alterations nece&s;&s;ary, that, in the end&punc; I thought it would be ju&s;ter to give a more faulty paraphra&s;e of my own.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the $word$, I apprehend it mu&s;t plea&s;e; as it has been &s;elected with the greate&s;t attention, both to the beauty of the airs, and its effect upon the theatre. There are, in|deed, &s;ome people, who may po&s;&s;ibly be of opi|nion, that I ought to have cho&s;en old Engli&s;h and Scotch ballads; or got mu&s;ic compo&s;ed in the &s;ame ta&s;te. But, in fact, &s;uch &s;ort of compo&s;itions &s;carce de&s;erve the name of mu&s;ic at all; at lea&s;t, they can have little or no merit on the &s;tage; where every thing ought to be &s;upported by a degree of action and character.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">
BUT, be the &s;ucce&s;s of this Opera what it will, it would be very ungrateful in me not to ac|knowledge my obligations to Mr. Garrick for the great pains he has taken in preparing it for repre&s;entation: if it &s;ucceeds, to him, indeed, it mu&s;t be chiefly attributed; who has a genius for every thing; and thinks nothing, however trifling, below his attention, that may prove an entertainment to the Public.</P>

<P>Judge, Amintor, by the tenderne&s;s I have for you, how I was &s;hocked at &s;o dreadful a &s;entence. At length, however, after much reflection, I hoped, by

taking certain mea&s;ures, not only to overcome the dangers with which you were menaced, but even to bring about the accompli&s;hment of the Oracle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam, impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me. When you were about two years old, there was born a prince&s;s, the daughter of a neigh|bouring king; 'twas your Daphne: I in&s;tantly con|veyed her away; and, tran&s;porting her to this palace, inacce&s;&s;ible to all human beings, &s;he has been here educated, and &s;erved only by &s;tatues, to which, by my art, I give motion. In &s;hort, I have taken every me|thod to per&s;uade her, that &s;he and I are the only two creatures that &s;peak, think, and rea&s;on; and that all others, formed merely for our u&s;e, or amu&s;ement, are ab&s;olutely in&s;en&s;ible, and incapable alike of love and hatred, pain and plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to what purpo&s;e, I be&s;eech you, have you filled her mind with all the&s;e fal&s;e prejudices?</P>

<SPEAKER>MINDORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>To make her believe, when I pre&s;ent you $o her&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>AMINTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I under&s;tand you; that I al&s;o am &s;ome unin|formed being; &s;ome puppet; but better organized than the re&s;t. The thought plea&s;es me, and may &s;ucceed. P&s;yche, before &s;he &s;aw Cupid, believed him a mon&s;ter; yet &s;he loved him: and Daphne, full of the notions you have prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her with, will believe me what the Oracle requires &s;he &s;hould; and, no$with&s;tanding, love me. Yes, madam, nature will in&s;truct her; that intellectual intelligence, that &s;ympathetic force of
<PB N="4" REF="10">
hearts, will work; and I &s;hall be the happie&s;t of mor|tals! Come, dear mother, let us go this in&s;tant and find her out: I will be a &s;tatue, a piece of in&s;en&s;ible marble.</P>

<P>Hold; it is not time for you to appear yet. I &s;ee Daphne cro&s;&s;ing the gallery yonder: leave us; and, in the conver&s;ation we have together, depend upon it, I will endeavour to prepare things &s;o as to bring them to your &s;atifaction.</P>

<STAGE>MINDORA, DAPHNE, DANCERS.</STAGE>
<P>Daphne, look at the&s;e &s;tatues; examine them; they are marble, and certainly you do not believe them &s;en|&s;ible; yet, by touching certain &s;prings, I will give them motions as extraordinary as tho&s;e you admired in your birds; which made you believe they felt and thought.&mdash;How now, Daphne; you are &s;ad of a &s;udden; does this little entertainment di&s;plea&s;e you?</P>

<P>It does indeed. Ah! my poor pretty birds! Are you then but machines! I thought you &s;en&s;ible, and th$$ $ou $$&s;ted infinite &s;atisfaction in &s;itting upon the &s;ame bough in the day, and re&s;ting together in &s;ome $word$ $re$ at night.
