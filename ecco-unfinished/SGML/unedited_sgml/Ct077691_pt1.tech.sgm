<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I meditate on my age and my
compatriots, I gaze on numerous fol|lies,
and trace &s;ome horrors. This view
exhibits nothing peculiar or extraordinary;
the human mind has it's few &s;tated eras;
it proceeds till it touches it's limits, and
then with a retrograde &s;tep returns on
it&s;elf. There is much le&s;s novelty in
glaring follies and audacious crimes, than
vulgar fools and vulgar villains &s;hall ever
conceive.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
Every age &s;eems characteri&s;ed by &s;ome
prevailing extravagance, and every emi|nent
philo&s;opher has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf
by &s;ome novel &s;y&s;tem; when the age
clo&s;ed, the extravagance and the philo&s;o|pher
were alike forgotten. Men once
confined their &s;peculations to nature, but
nature is exhau&s;tle&s;s, and man is &s;oon
exhau&s;ted. They then proceeded to mind,
but what we call intelligence has ever
been unintelligible to man. We now unite
matter with mind. A few &s;ublimely in|du&s;trious,
and mode&s;tly great geniu&s;es
have confe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e baffle our re|&s;earches,
and proclaim man an imperfect
being; &s;ome <HI>&s;oi-di&s;ant</HI> philo&s;ophers, in
the temerity of their ignorance, pretend to
have di&s;covered in man &startq;an infinite per|fectibility!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6">
But had our pre&s;ent philo&s;ophy proved,
like former romances of clo&s;et reclu&s;es,
the dreams of metaphy&s;ics, he who is
ver&s;ed in the hi&s;tory of human nature
would not con&s;ider it as an object of
importance. A mere metaphy&s;ician never
yet influenced even the ob&s;cure &s;treet he
inhabited; the vortexes of De&s;cartes, the
monads of Leibnitz, the &s;pirit of Berkley,
or the matter of Spino&s;a, with other
dreams too numerous and too idle to
mention, could only amu&s;e or weary an
incon&s;iderable portion of &s;ociety. The
&s;ophi&s;ts of Greece felt the &s;hrewdne&s;s
and the humour of Lucian, and the Je|&s;uits
of France, the wit and eloquence of
Pa&s;cal. Ridicule is at lea&s;t an admirable
te&s;t of the ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7">
But within this half-century it has
become the artifice of a dangerous cla&s;s of
men to unite politics with metaphy&s;ics,
and, great God! what politics! Here
my little reading de&s;erts me, and I am to
be informed, whether yet the world has
known a philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tem, which has
for it's avowed purpo&s;e a political &s;y&s;|tem?</P>
<P>We live, indeed, in &s;ickly and di&s;tem|pered
times; the MARVELLOUS only
intere&s;ts; it is ea&s;ier to excite our won|der
than to &s;atisfy our judgment; it is
the ta&s;te of the nur&s;ery; it is a childi&s;h
ta&s;te; we &s;hun in&s;truction, and wander
for puerility. Some a&s;&s;ure us that the
human mind is in it's infancy; I fear it
is in it's dotage; and we therefore do
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
not differ re&s;pecting the objects adapted
for it's amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>This philo&s;ophy is imagined to have
derived it's origin from the labours of
Voltaire. It is a calumny on that power|ful
genius. Voltaire, in no part of his
voluminous works, indulges it's romantic
ab&s;urdities; every where he affirms that
the mind and faculties of man are limit|ed,
and that to feel our ignorance and
imperfection is the end of all our &s;tudies.
A race of writers, inferior in ta&s;te and ge|nius,
to exceed the &s;agacity of their great
ma&s;ter, have promulgated their mon&s;trous
hyperboles. The editors of Voltaire's
works have in&s;erted a commentary of
this kind to combat the mode&s;t wi&s;dom
of this penetrating genius. Helvetius,
<PB N="x" REF="9">
Condorcet, and Mirabeau are among
tho&s;e who have &s;ought celebrity by novel
extravagancies. It is the&s;e men, who have
temerariou&s;ly talked of <HI>calculating events</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">To <HI>calculate</HI> has become the colloquial jargon of the French; thus Barras a&s;ked the American amba&s;&s;ador, &startq;Have you <HI>calculated</HI> the con&s;equences of your treaty with England?&endq; and the <HI>Redacteur</HI> (the Gazette of the directory) ob&s;erved on the &s;ail|ing of the French fleet for Ireland, &startq;The expedi|tion cannot fail; it has been well <HI>calculated.</HI>&endq;</NOTE>
which &s;o often depend on accident; have
loudly triumphed in <HI>fir&s;t principles,</HI> ever
concealed my&s;teriou&s;ly from us; and of the
<HI>infinite perfectibility</HI> of our mind and organs,
which, &s;carcely arrived at their exi&s;tence,
peri&s;h before the eyes of tho&s;e who de|claim
on their eternity. The&s;e philo&s;o|phers
&s;upport their &s;y&s;tem by dwelling on
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
what is <HI>not known;</HI> we oppo&s;e them by
what <HI>is known;</HI> that is, we oppo&s;e human
nature to a few metaphy&s;icians.</P>
<P>This doctrine has been &s;ervilely follow|ed
by &s;ome living writers in this country.
Their politics are much more intelligible
than their metaphy&s;ics. Romantic ex|travagance
in philo&s;ophy might be ea&s;ily
forgiven; it were but the fermentation
of &s;ome noble and elevated minds, and,
like the froth floating on the &s;urface of
a rich liquor, we would blow it away, and
ta&s;te the nectar beneath; but of the&s;e
men we will not ta&s;te the &s;ophi&s;ticated
draughts, for they
<Q><L>&startq;&mdash;have drugged their po&s;&s;ets,</L>
<L>That death and nature would contend about us,</L>
<L>Whether to live or die&mdash;&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11">
And let <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them apply the re&s;t
of the quotation; they have projected
their work of death; but they now feel
what a female Cataline felt in her dread
of di&s;appointed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination:
<Q><L>&startq;&mdash;the attempt, and not the deed,</L>
<L>Confounds us&mdash;yet we laid their daggers ready!&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>When I reflect on our religions, I per|ceive
innumerable &s;ects: among the
people the hotte&s;t fanatici&s;m, among phi|lo&s;ophers
the mo&s;t extravagant projects,
and among tho&s;e who are neither people
nor philo&s;ophers the mo&s;t ridiculous my&s;ti|ci&s;m.
Philo&s;ophy has no religion; reli|gion
has no philo&s;ophy; an extermina|tion
is menaced, and an union is alike
rejected. The religion of Chri&s;t is the
pure&s;t philo&s;ophy. I grieve, therefore,
to &s;ee Mu&s;tis in the church of Je&s;us.
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
The warmth and imbecility of certain
bigots re&s;embles the &s;tate of tho&s;e un|happy
beings, who is the la&s;t &s;tage of a
con&s;umption find that their heat is only
the effect of their debility<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Some,</HI> we all fear, would commit a &s;acrilege again&s;t humanity for a mitre, as Bellarmin did for a cardinal's hat. He maintained, for the &s;ake of his promotion, that &startq;if the Pope forbid the exerci&s;e of virtue, and command that of vice, the Roman church, under pain of a &s;in, was ob|liged to abandon virtue for vice, <HI>ni&s;i vellet con|&s;cientiam peccare.</HI>&endq; We have Bellarmins in poli|tics and religion: a va&s;t and aweful interval &s;e|parates a Bellarmin, a Whitaker, and a Hor&s;ley, from a WATSON!</NOTE>. If Chri&s;tia|nity
is ever to fix the affections of man|kind,
it can only be by the virtues and
moderation of it's chiefs; to the clergy
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
we look up, at this vacillating moment,
with hope or with de&s;pair.</P>
<P>When I enter the world of manners, I
&s;ee with indignation our prodigality and
our avarice. This age, even from it's
&s;atiri&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Cowper, I think, calls Brown's E&s;timate of the Times, in his pro&s;aic and nervous ver&s;e,</P>
<P>&startq;The ine&s;timable E&s;timate of Brown.&endq;</P></NOTE>, has received the di&s;tinctive
prai&s;e of humanity; but this humanity
is but a mode of our pervading di&s;&s;ipa|tion;
our hearts, like our fortunes, are
indulged in exce&s;&s;ive gratifications, and
alike become feeble, cold, and exhau&s;ted.
Hence we &s;ee, that the &s;entimentali&s;t is
at a certain period of life the mo&s;t un|feeling,
and the mo&s;t voluble on &s;en&s;ibi|lity.
Enormous wealth is obtained by
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
enormous &s;peculations; we have become
a nation of jobbers; hence, the refu&s;e of
&s;ociety are rai&s;ed to fix the popular re|gard;
the &s;lime of the bed is unnaturally
to&s;&s;ed up, and floats on the clear current
of public honour. Every where the in|dividual
does every thing for the public
eye, and nothing for dome&s;tic enjoyment;
we vie with each other; we &s;acrifice, and
we are &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome popular prejudices
cruel in their effects. To trace and to
expo&s;e them is philo&s;ophical morality.
I have &s;elected one in the hi&s;tory of a
female in this work, who was originally
found in the &s;treets as a pro&s;titute; and
the unju&s;t and melancholy con&s;equences
of that &s;ituation to her&s;elf and to her
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
friends form the axis on which the
wheel of fortune revolves in this hi&s;tory.
If the filial character of Emily &s;hould
exhibit the mi&s;eries of a &s;plendid depen|dence,
in a young and accompli&s;hed
woman, it will not form an in&s;ignificant
per&s;onage in this drama of life.</P>
<P>Such is the analy&s;is of the&s;e Sketches.
I have cho&s;en the <HI>form</HI> rather than the
<HI>matter</HI> of a novel. Some bold and im|partial
truths are contained in the&s;e little
volumes; it is however po&s;&s;ible to be
too partial to &s;ome opinions, without
being of any party.</P>
<P>My &s;incerity is ardent, and if I ap|pear
to prefer one &s;ide to another, it is
becau&s;e otherwi&s;e we can have no princi|ple
of action. In this country, popular
opinion has reached two oppo&s;ite extre|mities;
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
when one party will yield no|thing,
the other will claim every thing.
Our pre&s;s is however free, and if our
writers were &s;incere, it would be the
organ of the public voice; the correc|tion
of our mini&s;ters, our &s;overeign,
and our&s;elves; but there are men who
would quench their mon&s;trous hatreds
in the blood of him who only differs with
them in opinion. I have heard in public
places our government accu&s;ed of in|clining
towards &s;anguinary mea&s;ures! and
by whom? By audacious traitors, who in
their dreams revel on ma&s;&s;acres, who&s;e
phy&s;iognomy betrays the wild and &s;avage
nature of their hearts, who &s;kulk in
petty confederacies in this our beloved
country, and &s;hew that it is &s;till free,
&s;ince they are permitted to voci&s;erate
<PB N="xviii" REF="17">
their accu&s;ations of it's &s;lavery. Liberty
is awefully loved by a Briton; it forms
his national religion; and &s;ince he has
lived to &s;ee it &s;ubmitted to the caprices
of levity, to the pollutions of villainy, to
the temerity of coffee-hou&s;e evening do|tards,
and to the in&s;ane ignorance of the
tumultuous people, he drops a tear on
the venerable CONSTITUTION, and if
he injures it's &s;pirit and it's canons, by
throwing all his weight on one of it's
portions, it is the innocent crime of ne|ce&s;&s;ity;
it is preferable to wre&s;tle with a
&s;overeign, than with a convention;
<Q>&startq;He flies from petty TYRANTS to the THRONE.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The expelled Marius &s;at amid&s;t the
wrecks of Carthage; the blank horror
&s;oothed the ferocious brea&s;t of the re|publican,
and he gave a gha&s;tly &s;mile
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
on the aweful ve&s;tiges of departed gran|deur.
The remor&s;ele&s;s and terrible Sylla

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING read &s;everal detached pa&s;|&s;ages
of this work to three or four
critical friends, I was much grieved in
ob&s;erving their malicious promptne&s;s ap|plying
the characters and reflections to
individuals. I was not much &s;urpri&s;ed
to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame character was
frequently given to different per&s;ons.</P>
<P>And here I mo&s;t &s;olemnly declare, that
the&s;e volumes contain not a &s;ingle indi|viduality;
at the &s;ame time, that there
is not one character, and &s;carcely one
incident, which is not founded on facts.
<PB N="xxi" REF="20">
In two or three places, where the attack
was meant to be per&s;onal, I have <HI>named</HI>
the per&s;ons, who are properly before the
public.</P>
<P>If &s;uch fal&s;e critici&s;ms were to deter
the Noveli&s;t from the duty he owes to
the public and to him&s;elf, we &s;hould lo&s;e
the mo&s;t engaging and mo&s;t in&s;tructive
cla&s;s of literature. I &s;hall only &s;ay here,
that I am a man who would blu&s;h to
court or fear another, whoever he might
be; and that no pu&s;illanimity &s;hall ever
be communicated to my free and hone&s;t
pen. Two great ma&s;ters in the &s;chool,
in which I feel my&s;elf but a feeble
arti&s;t, have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves on this
&s;ubject, and although I would hope that
the pa&s;&s;ages are familiar to every reader,
yet from the frequent violation of the
true &s;pirit of critici&s;m, as rare as the true
&s;pirit of genius, I fear they are either
little attended to, or have never been
<PB N="xxii" REF="21">
read, as &s;ome &s;agacious readers con&s;ider
<HI>Prefaces</HI> as &s;o much wa&s;te paper. I &s;hall,
however, tran&s;cribe the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from
the Prefaces of the&s;e two great &s;tudents
of human nature, and &s;hall never af|terwards
pay the &s;lighte&s;t regard to the
malice of &s;ome readers. Fielding, in his
Preface to Jo&s;eph Andrews, &s;ays, &startq;I
&s;olemnly prote&s;t I have no intention to
vilify or a&s;per&s;e any one; for though
every thing is copied from the book of
nature, and &s;carce a character or action
produced, which I have not taken from
my own ob&s;ervation and experience, yet I
have u&s;ed the utmo&s;t care to ob&s;cure the
per&s;ons by &s;uch different circum&s;tances,
degrees, and colours, that it will be im|po&s;&s;ible
to gue&s;s at them with any degree
of certainty.&endq;&mdash;Le Sage, in his Preface to
Gil Blas, has with an hone&s;t warmth de|livered
his &s;entiments on a &s;imilar accu&s;a|tion.
&startq;As there are &s;ome people who
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
cannot read without making applications
of the vicious and ludicrous characters
they meet with in works of this kind, I
declare to the&s;e mi&s;chievous readers, that
they will be to blame if they apply any
of the pictures drawn in this book. I
publicly own that my purpo&s;e is to re|pre&s;ent
life as we find it; but God forbid
that I &s;hould undertake to delineate any
man in particular!&endq;</P>
<P>Such are the declarations of the&s;e two
great ma&s;ters; with them I &s;hould trem|ble
at any other comparative trial, but in
a love of truth.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Charles departs from his Country Friends,

<P>THE Reverend Mr. Hamilton, the
father of Charles, was a re&s;pected
clergyman, the re&s;ident of above half a
century in his own vicarage. His &s;mall
par&s;onage hou&s;e was adjacent to his
church; it's venerable air of antiquity
re&s;embled the genius of it's inhabitant;
and &s;uch was it's dome&s;tic &s;anctity, that
with greater propriety than the church
it&s;elf, it might have been called &startq;a hou&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="25">
of God.&endq; No emulation of modern
ta&s;te di&s;gui&s;ed it's character; it was a
low building, the Gothic windows were
luxuriantly encircled with the foliage of
the vine, the hall was &s;pacious, the par|lours
&s;mall, but the pannelled wain|&s;cotting
was held by him in high re|verence,
for it had been removed there
from one of Queen Elizabeth's coun|try
palaces; and he would &s;ometimes
point with exultation at a carved chimney-piece,
once appertaining to the above re|gal
per&s;onage, and exclaim, &startq;They work|ed
on a different plan in tho&s;e days; but I
promi&s;e you, none of our chimney-pieces
will be of any &s;ervice to our po&s;terity.&endq;
Some of the juniors of this worthy par&s;on,
who were among the three hundred and
ninety-nine chaplains of the Prince, who
doubled their livings and who tripled
their tythes, adding likewi&s;e a few random
chaplain&s;hips of &s;everal regiments, a plea|&s;ant
<PB N="3" REF="26">
prebend, and a comfortable canonry,
carried on a more lucrative trade, and
were, by &s;uch clerical advantages, enabled
to keep their &s;tables in better repair than
their churches. Mr. Hamilton never
pal&s;ied the arm of indu&s;try with the iron
mace of &s;acerdotal rapacity. He was not
a wea&s;el among the poultry, a rot among
the &s;heep, and a mildew in the ear of corn.
Every one cheri&s;hed &s;ome plea&s;ing re|collection
of his kindne&s;s; and the hearts
of his pari&s;hioners were the concealed
offering the Prie&s;t pre&s;ented to his God.</P>
<P>The good man had indeed an ex|alted
idea of the character he had to
&s;upport, and it was long before he could
per&s;uade him&s;elf to put on that holy
habit, which he wore with an aweful
delight. The &s;elf-re&s;pect he paid to
him&s;elf as a pari&s;h prie&s;t, rendered him
re&s;pectable. A par&s;on (&s;aid he) is a title
familiari&s;ed into vulgarity; but it is the
<PB N="4" REF="27">
mo&s;t aweful humanity can receive. <HI>Par&s;on</HI>
is <HI>per&s;ona;</HI> becau&s;e by his <HI>per&s;on</HI> he re|pre&s;ents
or <HI>per&s;onifies</HI> the church, which
is an invi&s;ible body. He alone is &s;aid,
<HI>Vicem &s;eu per&s;onam eccle&s;iae gerere.</HI> And
this (he would add) is the law of the
land; the expre&s;s words of Sir Edward
Coke; the alliance between church and
&s;tate. This alliance was one of his ea&s;ie&s;t
hobby-hor&s;es. But the mo&s;t remarkable
of them was his voluminous labour on
the Trinity, the eternal object of his me|ditations,
and the &s;ource of his felicity.
To adopt his very expre&s;&s;ions, &startq;It is a
my&s;tery which we firmly believe the
truth of, and heartily adore the depth
of.&endq;</P>
<P>And indeed the only remarkable event
in the quiet uniformity of this good man's
life, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened
on the day that he publi&s;hed his &startq;Evi|dences
of the Trinity throughout all
<PB N="5" REF="28">
Nations.&endq; That important day he di&s;|tingui&s;hed
by allotting a roa&s;ted ox and
a butt of porter to the poor of his
pari&s;h; and we are &s;orry to record, that
this evidence of his rapture, and his be|nevolence,
only &s;erved to increa&s;e the
charges of publication. Perhaps our
worthy Par&s;on had done better in fol|lowing
an old &s;tatute of the Religious of
the Citeaux, which ordered their abbots
to preach every Sunday, excepting on that
of the Trinity&mdash;<HI>propter difficultatem ma|teriae.</HI></P>
<P>Charles was the only &s;on of this ex|cellent
man. In this calm and &s;eque&s;tered
&s;pot his father inured him to tho&s;e in|ten&s;e
habits, which make the pupil the
&s;emblance of the preceptor; as the &s;hadow,
on the &s;mooth and undi&s;turbed &s;urface of
the water, is an accurate repre&s;entation of
the reflected object. Charles was con|&s;titutionally
virtuous; his generous blood
<PB N="6" REF="29">
flowed with an equable gentlene&s;s; na|ture
directed that prompt and active
&s;en&s;ation which looks like in&s;tinct, and
which performs the duties of humanity,
without the cold aid of philo&s;ophy;
acting better than it rea&s;ons. Some prin|ciples
he had received from his father were
often at variance with his heart. A
&s;y&s;tem of religion, or politics, is the
fa&s;hion of a particular period; but the
emotions of humanity are the imperi&s;hable
virtues of every age; the former are but
ridiculous or fanciful dre&s;&s;es, which men
through cu&s;tom adopt, while the latter
con&s;titute the natural form of man, which
we may di&s;gui&s;e, but can never alter.</P>
<P>Allied in blood to the noble family of
the Belfields, Charles had long received
the promi&s;e of their patronage, and the
propo&s;al was now accepted. His vene|rable
parent, reminded by his age, con|&s;idered
this fir&s;t as a final &s;eparation; and
<PB N="7" REF="30">
leading him into his library, enforced &s;ome
<HI>orthodox</HI> in&s;tructions, which had an in|fluence
on the future life of our hero.
The la&s;t trembling pre&s;&s;ure from the hand
of a revered parent; the touching and
interrupted tones of the voice we love, and
&s;hall no more hear; the tear of &s;enility
trickling on the glowing cheek of youth;
the&s;e at the moment penetrate the heart,
in&s;ert them&s;elves amongit's fibres, and a&s;&s;i|milate
with our exi&s;tence. The tear is felt,
when he who &s;heds it, &s;heds tears no
more, and the voice of a father is heard
from his grave. Eventful moment of
exi&s;tence in which we receive the in|heritance
of a paternal character!</P>
<P>There were al&s;o two friends of his
father, inhabitants nearly as ancient as
him&s;elf of this pari&s;h, but their hobby-hor&s;ical
di&s;po&s;itions were of another cha|racter,
being both devoted to works of
ta&s;te. Charles took his farewell of the&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="31">
two friends. The one was the Apothe|cary,
who with tolerable facility com|po&s;ed
much unreadable ver&s;e, and was
then employed on a couple of Epics;
three Centenaries of legitimate &s;onnets;
and on the point of publi&s;hing his Epi|grams
in folio. The other was the Draw|ing
Ma&s;ter, who was a Claude Lorraine;
that is, he painted Sun-&s;ets, which were
mi&s;taken for brick-kilns; hills, like wool|&s;acks,
and trees, with on their tops that
inde&s;cribable grace, that &startq;<HI>Je ne &s;&ccedil;ais quoi,</HI>&endq;
that &startq;<HI>Certo non &s;o che</HI>&endq; that &startq;<HI>Nequeo
mon&s;trare, et &s;entio tantum,</HI>&endq; as Juvenal &s;ays
(how &s;hall I expre&s;s my&s;elf?) which
gave them a &s;triking re&s;emblance to a
row of barber's blocks, with each a little
unpowdered perriwig.</P>
<P>The poetical Apothecary thus addre&s;&s;ed
him, &startq;May your literary talents not have to
encounter the con&s;piracy which, as I have
often mentioned, has &s;o long prevailed
<PB N="9" REF="32">
again&s;t me. I can write ten thou&s;and ver&s;es
a year, but the age has grown horridly
pro&s;aic. Di&s;cover this nefarious cabal,
now exi&s;ting the&s;e forty years. The
Monthly Reviewers are at the head; for
on the publication of my fir&s;t poem, they
had the audacity to a&s;k me, why I did not
write in pro&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>The Painter &s;aid, &startq;I have &s;ent my
pictures to the Academy, and made annual
journies to London, to the utter ruin of
my bu&s;ine&s;s, to attend to that &s;timulating
applau&s;e which my native town (the
future biographer of Engli&s;h painters &s;hall
record) has never given. Here they have
no eyes, and at London they have no
humanity. All my Sun-&s;ets have been
hung in dark corners. Think of that,
Charles! a bad light to a picture is like
tho&s;e errata in printing, which turn one's
fine&s;t things into non&s;en&s;e. My Girl
feeding Pigs was hung &s;o fatally la&s;t year,
<PB N="10" REF="33">
that I heard &s;everal wonder at the &s;tupid
fancy of the painter, who placed a&s;&s;es in
pig-&s;tyes. To be &s;ure the &s;tyes were
&s;tyes; I defy them there, Charles; but
my pigs really looked like a&s;&s;es! a cur&s;e
on all picture-hangers!&endq;</P>
<P>Thus it happens, that when a Par&s;on
publi&s;hes a volume concerning the Tri|nity,
he proclaims the vice of the age to
be Ariani&s;m; the Poet, who compo&s;es
ver&s;es, that might occa&s;ion an indi|ge&s;tion,
perceives the age to be pro&s;aic;
while the Painter bla&s;phemes the light
of heaven for not rendering the objects
of nature more conformable to his no|tions.
The&s;e gentlemen were otherwi&s;e,
when not mounted on their great hor&s;es,
very hone&s;t men; &s;o judicious, as clearly
to di&s;cern the ab&s;urdities of each other,
and &s;o happy, as to enjoy the comfort
of not perceiving their own. But we
cannot but &s;u&s;pect, that if the&s;e hone&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="34">
gentlemen had, in&s;tead of mounting their
hobbies, enclo&s;ed &s;ome of the wa&s;te lands,

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of &s;ome of our Hero's fir&s;t Acquaintance in
London.</HEAD>
<P>LONDON, that univer&s;e of a city,
containing all the climates of the
human mind, and all the variations of the
human &s;pecies, was not entered by the
reflecting Charles without tho&s;e tumul|tuous
emotions produced by the gu&s;h of
novelty, which inebriates the &s;en&s;es. A
mixed conception of grandeur hitherto
unob&s;erved, and mi&s;ery hitherto unknown,
taught him to feel for humanity, a pride
and an humiliation; here he fir&s;t per|ceived
that man was an enigma yet un|&s;olved;
every thing that imagination con|ceives
of great and benevolent, neigh|bouring
clo&s;ely on every thing it con|ceives
<PB N="13" REF="36">
of mean and cruel. Every glance
brought &s;ome new object, every &s;ound
combined with &s;ome new reflection; and
in &s;urrounding objects he &s;eemed to lo&s;e
his own exi&s;tence. He i&s;&s;ued from the
inn, the next morning, to wait on Lord
Belfield, but had &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed a few
&s;treets, when the &s;weet pliability of his
&s;pirits diffu&s;ed it&s;elf around him, and
flying from meditation to meditation, he
found that no object in London was more
intere&s;ting than London it&s;elf.</P>
<P>He walked through the we&s;tern parts
of the town more plea&s;ed than di&s;&s;a|tisfied;
he viewed faces which &s;eemed to
have more mirth than malice, yet won|dered
to encounter &s;ome who dragged
their &s;teps with a li&s;tle&s;s and melancholy
air; becau&s;e he yet knew not the pre&s;&s;ure
of inaction. He knew not that this un|fortunate
race were eager, but volatile in
plea&s;ure; that when they &s;hook the
<PB N="14" REF="37">
blo&s;&s;oms they &s;ighed for the fruit; that
never penetrating the &s;uperficies of the
&s;oul, their imbecile pa&s;&s;ions were without
aliment; plural loves appertain to no one,
and the friend&s;hip commenced in a mi|nute
terminates with the hour.</P>
<P>His eye was detained by the numerous
labours which indolence occa&s;ions; the
magnificent tri&s;les of our Sybarites. As
he looked through the windows of &s;ome
fa&s;hionable &s;hops, he thought, &startq;&s;ome in|genuity
appears in the&s;e inventions, but
more one would think is required in their
u&s;e; to a &s;tranger like me it becomes a
metaphy&s;ical exerci&s;e to comprehend their
purpo&s;es; and I doubt that to rea&s;on on
them for an hour would frequently be
but an un&s;ucce&s;sful operation.&endq;</P>
<P>The narrowe&s;t &s;treets in this metropolis
he found the mo&s;t populous, and thought
that the &s;pacious and &s;olitary elegance
of the we&s;tern &s;eemed to be more requi|&s;ite
<PB N="15" REF="38">
in the ea&s;tern parts of our town. The
latter have the evidences of a rude and par|&s;imonious
age, but the former the exhibi|tions
of corrupt and poli&s;hed times; that
portion of London appeared the ungrateful
and elegant heir of a contemned and &s;ordid
parent. Here a confu&s;ion of all noi&s;es, of all
&s;mells, and of all ranks, appeared to &s;pread
an ince&s;&s;ant di&s;traction, and re&s;embled a tu|multuous
flight. Borne along a tide of ra|tional
beings, Charles found no lei&s;ure to
meditate, and among his fellow citizens was
attracted by no &s;ympathy; for man &s;uc|ceeded
man, like pieces of mechani&s;m, that
proceeding from one mould, may be
counted, but cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>As Charles was engaged in one of his
deepe&s;t reveries, a gentleman apologized
for having trod on his foot, and this with
&s;o winning an urbanity, and &s;uch elegance
of manner, that our hero was enchanted
with this inhabitant of London, the fir&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="39">
with whom he had yet interchanged civi|lities.
He parted from him with regret.
We have none of the&s;e accompli&s;hed men
in our village (&s;aid Charles to him&s;elf)
and the hobnails of a pea&s;ant are not &s;o
painful as his inhumanity. As he was
proceeding in his &s;oliloquy, &startq;a filthy dun|geon
villain,&endq; as Otway de&s;cribes &s;uch,
came up, and in tones more repul&s;ive
than attractive, informed him that he had
certainly been robbed. Charles found it
was true. I am an officer of ju&s;tice, con|tinued
the &s;tern &s;tranger. I know where
to find George, and make me a proper
gratuity, and you may hang him. Charles,
examining the countenance of the runner,
&s;u&s;pected him, and not the polite gentle|man.
He therefore called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the crowd, had
him brought before our modern Lycurgus,
Mr. Ju&s;tice&mdash;.</P>
<P>To write with the veracity and the di&s;|cernment
<PB N="17" REF="40">
of an hi&s;torian (and which we
here inform the reader are by no means
correlative qualities, as men of genius have
found it ea&s;ier to exhibit an admirable
di&s;cernment without any veracity at all)
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that Mr. Ju&s;tice&mdash;(who
I do not name, as the &s;imple name
of certain per&s;ons may not unju&s;tly be
deemed a libel) was not quite &s;o much a&s;|toni&s;hed
as the re&s;t, at &s;eeing his chief
myrmidon in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; for
it is a wi&s;e cu&s;tom with the Areopagus of
Bow-&s;treet, to follow the vulgar precept in
the catching of thieves. Mr. Ju&s;tice
&mdash;felt more indignation than &s;urpri&s;e;
indignation ari&s;ing from the ingratitude
of his <HI>proteg&eacute;;</HI> for he &s;aid in his pa&s;&s;ion,
(and pa&s;&s;ion is a loquacious revealer of &s;e|crets)
that after having been a pad, and a
highwayman on a &s;tolen hor&s;e, and through
his friendly interpo&s;ition &s;uffered to be|come
an hone&s;t man at la&s;t, by his pro|motion
<PB N="18" REF="41">
to the place of head runner, it was
the vile&s;t ingratitude, and the drop &s;hould
now have its rights; adding, in the que|rulous
language of offended patronage,
that there was no tru&s;ting one's own bro|ther.</P>
<P>The runner, who, whatever robberies
he might have committed, was no mon|&s;ter
of ingratitude, having a mo&s;t natural
and feeling antipathy of the afore&s;aid drop,
&s;ince in his pre&s;ent office he had been in
the full receipt of all it's privileges, re|wards,
pro&s;ecutions and non-pro&s;ecutions,
qua&s;hings and hu&s;h-money, &s;ent from his
heart a &s;teaming oath, hot with geneva
and gratitude. Every being expre&s;&s;es
his affections and his a&s;&s;everations accord|ing
to his habits, by which, becau&s;e we
are not always acquainted with them, we
are &s;ometimes more &s;hocked than con|vinced.
The fair reader, on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion,
would rai&s;e her humid eyes to
<PB N="19" REF="42">
heaven, cla&s;p two beautiful white hands,
and &s;hed, in expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence, the &s;ofte&s;t
tear; a per&s;on of a &s;terner mould would
fix a &s;teadfa&s;t eye on the unju&s;t accu&s;er,
and &s;hew his gratitude by an in&s;ulting
contempt of the charge of ingratitude;
now the&s;e, and &s;imilar manners of con|firming
our veracity, or gratitude, had
been perfectly unintelligible to the iron
nerves of Mr. Ju&s;tice&mdash;. And mu&s;t
we be condemned for vulgari&s;m when we
relate the characters of the vulgar? We
pretend not to narrate one continued &s;e|ries
of romantic grandeur; we look for
nature as &s;he walks about this great town.
We &s;hall therefore proceed to inform our
reader in what manner our runner <HI>con|vinced</HI>
Mr. Ju&s;tice of his veracity and
gratitude.</P>
<P>It was done <HI>anatomically;</HI> that is, with
as much knowledge of the human body
as a runner may be &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s.
<PB N="20" REF="43">
He felt the zeal that mo&s;t certainly warm|ed
the good catholic bi&s;hop Ernulphus,
when he dictated that excommunication
which ought to be read and admired in
Shandean hi&s;tory; and he commenced by
mo&s;t devoutly damning his eyes, his liver,
his heart, &amp;c. till having reached a climax
of this &s;elf-anathema, he ea&s;ily per&s;uaded
his patron of his hone&s;ty. He &s;ucceeded
on the principle that makes a carman in|telligible
to his hor&s;es; that is, by certain
oaths who&s;e long u&s;e and intonation they
perfectly under&s;tand; and the mo&s;t dread|ful
to mode&s;t or pious ears are, in the&s;e
ca&s;es, always the be&s;t. When our run|ner
had related the fact, Mr. Ju&s;tice&mdash;,
turning to Charles, with much juridi|cal
importance &s;aid, &startq;Sir, I mu&s;t commit
you for a fal&s;e charge, and for defamation.
That man, I tell you, is one of my ho|ne&s;te&s;t
fellows, and has not committed a
robbery the&s;e ten years.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="44">
In the &s;ecrecy of an interior apartment
our hero became more enlightened. There
George attended a civil me&s;&s;age, and un|der
a promi&s;e of non-pro&s;ecution, and as
a man of honour (as the runner ob&s;erved)
confe&s;&s;ed the robbery. Charles heard
and &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;hment. His accom|pli&s;hed
gentleman acknowledged him&s;elf
a pickpocket, and a guardian of ju&s;tice,
a footpad. Our hero, confe&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf
to be a country gentleman, was in
con&s;ideration of that, &amp;c. di&s;charged with
a reprimand.</P>
<P>Returning in the evening, he was ac|co&s;ted
by &s;ome unfortunate females, who
gave a thou&s;and &s;weet care&s;&s;es from their
impure lips, like ro&s;es di&s;tilled in an alem|bic
tinged with gall. But ingenuous youth
is timid in the fir&s;t moments of it's novel
perils, and imagines all it's trembling
doubts to be a virtuous indignation. To
their obliging invitations Charles replied
<PB N="22" REF="45">
by &s;ome quotations on immode&s;ty from
one of his father's &s;ermons, and would
have entered into further di&s;cour&s;e, had
not each fair auditor expre&s;&s;ed the impa|tience
of contempt. On Holborn Hill, a
female of a certain age and decent dre&s;s,
formed not to provoke love, but to im|pre&s;s
re&s;pect, acco&s;ted him, and laid her
hand on his &s;houlder. A departing
mode&s;ty &s;eemed &s;till to linger in her
&s;ilence. Charles, intere&s;ted in her in|tentions,
at variance with her appear|ance,
forgot his father's &s;ermon, and felt an
emotion of humanity. This child of mis|fortune
bur&s;t into tears, and pre&s;&s;ing his
hand with a gentle &s;ympathy, a warm
blu&s;h flew acro&s;s her cheek, which told
&s;he came not to excite the voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s
of the &s;en&s;es. She de&s;cribed her &s;i|tuation.
She was a widow with four
children, who &s;tood i&s;olated in this a&s;&s;em|blage
of millions of her fellow-beings; who&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="46">
labours were in&s;ufficient to afford a mor|&s;el
to her helple&s;s offspring; and who, in
oppo&s;ition to a blamele&s;s life, and to
a cultivated &s;en&s;ibility, when &s;he heard
the voice of her children, naked, de&s;olate,
and hungry, ru&s;hed, in the darkne&s;s of the
night, to a pollution that never reached
her heart.</P>
<P>&startq;And you, young man, (&s;he &s;aid) who|ever

We are interdicted from the rights of &s;o|ciety;

<P>THE next day our hero ha&s;tened to
Lord Belfield, and as he pa&s;&s;ed
through the &s;treets, clo&s;ed his ear and his
eye as well as he could, to the &s;ugge&s;tions
of fancy, dreading the perplexities of the
preceding day. As he proceeded, all the
ideas of nobility, which his father had &s;o
frequently inculcated, ro&s;e with a glow|ing
&s;en&s;ation. Lord Belfield was one of
the ancient peers who &s;at in the hou&s;e by
de&s;cent, and not by creation. His blood
was enriched with &s;ome &s;prinklings from
the royal veins of France and of Eng|land,
and the imagination of Charles was
awed by the departed predece&s;&s;ors of
<PB N="28" REF="51">
Belfield, who ro&s;e, in a mar&s;halled order,
before his timid and mode&s;t nature. Had
my Lord Belfield (he thought) been a
commoner! &startq;I have <HI>&s;een</HI> commoners. An
ob&s;cure being like my&s;elf, admitted to
the &s;ociety of a man of &s;uch a noble de|&s;cent,
if received haughtily mu&s;t feel a &s;elf-degradation,
and if received with kindne&s;s
mu&s;t &s;till recollect that the equality he
enjoys is a conferred favour, and not a
mutual obligation. How I &s;hould hate
to be one, who is only <HI>&s;uffered</HI> to be what
he is! Yet is nobility a golden chain of
ornament and utility in our government;
a &s;oftening &s;hade of monarchy that re|lieves
the bright picture of our con&s;titu|tion:
a nobleman carries with him a
weight of glory, or a weight of &s;hame; if
he rivals his virtuous ance&s;tors, who more
de&s;erves our veneration? And if he wi|thers
all his leaves of honour, the noble
&s;tem from which he &s;prung will exi&s;t as
<PB N="29" REF="52">
the peculiar memorial of his degeneracy.
The nobleman is entitled to a re&s;pect not
due to a private citizen, who&s;e ob&s;curity
conceals his defects; for this re&s;pect is
either paid to him for him&s;elf, which will
be his glory, or it is paid to the memory
of his ance&s;tors, which will be his infamy.
It is only by this order of men, that a
nation can &s;ecure to it&s;elf a race of illu&s;|trious
characters. Uninfluenced by the
confined intere&s;ts of other individuals,
what does a noble claim for the remunera|tion
of actions, for which others are re|compen&s;ed
by new honours, or meaner
gratifications? Of the&s;e he wants neither;
the remembrance of his ance&s;tors, and the
proud rivalry of his own conduct, are the
pricele&s;s remunerations his great &s;oul can
alone receive. Lord Belfield, the de&s;cen|dant
of &s;o many illu&s;trious progenitors;
what a &s;timulating &s;ource of noble ac|tions!&endq;&mdash;So,
repeating the fir&s;t lines of the
<PB N="30" REF="53">
fir&s;t Ode of Horace, and philo&s;ophizing
in this manner, Charles at length arrived
at the hou&s;e of his noble patron.</P>
<P>Announced, he entered tremblingly and
confu&s;ed into a library, where he &s;aw a jolly
groom, booted and &s;purred, with a du&s;ty
coat and cropt hair.</P>
<P>Lord Belfield received him with the
utmo&s;t familiarity; a familiarity which, as
it was be&s;towed on every one alike, could be
con&s;idered by no one as a favour. His cha|racter
is too unimportant to be recorded
even in this page of minor biography; and,
but for his connection with our hero, would
never have been con&s;idered by us, as
&s;ufficiently important, to &s;ay in print, that
it was unimportant. His revenue was
one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in England;
but his devotion to a faction of dema|gogues,
who a&s;&s;umed the title of repub|licans;
to &s;ophi&s;ts, who called them&s;elves
philo&s;ophers; and his imbecility of mind
<PB N="31" REF="54">
in all the ver&s;atile di&s;&s;ipations of the times,
in which he had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to
have corrupted his own lady; all the&s;e
levities and crimes rendered his fortune
in&s;ufficient for his purpo&s;es. Feeble in
him&s;elf, he became a powerful engine in
the artful hands of others. He was re|markable
for exulting that his coronet
was placed on his carts; the philo&s;ophers
&s;aid he had done this to degrade every
en&s;ign of nobility; while others con&s;idered
that on the contrary the&s;e en&s;igns were
&s;till plea&s;ing to his eye, and were placed
to &s;hew that there exi&s;ted &s;ome di&s;tinction
between the cart of a commoner, and the
cart of a lord. Such was this lord; who
by his nobility was di&s;graced, by his
opulence impoveri&s;hed, and by his philo|&s;ophy
made the dupe of his pa&s;&s;ions.
How many circum&s;tances favourable to
man, were perverted in the character of
Lord Belfield!</P>

He has con&s;tructed tables, phy|&s;ical
and metaphy&s;ical, moral and poli|tical,
where, with preci&s;ion, are marked
the different degrees of probability, and
con&s;equently, the quantity of belief, which
may be a&s;&s;igned to every opinion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This jargon is curiou&s;ly indulged by Helve|rius. &startq;Since truth is an indivi&s;ible point, and that we cannot &s;ay of a truth, that it is more or le&s;s &s;o, it is evident, that if we are more certain of our own exi&s;tence, than that of bodies, the exi&s;tence of bo|dies, con&s;equently, is only a probability; a probabi|lity very great, and which, upon the whole, is equi|valent to evidence. Now, if almo&s;t all our truths, are reduced to probabilities, how much &s;hould we owe to that man of genius who would undertake to direct phy&s;ical, metaphy&s;ical, moral and political tables, where &s;hould be noted with preci&s;ion, all the divers degrees of probability, and con&s;equently of belief, which we ought to a&s;&s;ign to every opinion.&endq; He then has the timely kindne&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the&s;e afore&s;aid tables. &startq;The exi&s;tence of bodies, for in&s;tance, would be placed in the phy&s;ical tables as the fir&s;t degree of certitude; then afterwards would be determined what are the odds that the &s;un will ri&s;e to-morrow, or in ten, or twenty years, &amp;c. In the moral and political tables, would be equally placed, in the fir&s;t degree of certitude, the exi&s;tence of Rome or London; then that of heroes, &s;uch as Cae&s;ar or William the Conqueror; then we &s;hould gradually de&s;cend through the &s;cale of probabilities till we came to facts le&s;s certain; and at length to the pretended miracles of Mahomet, to the prodigies atte&s;ted by &s;o many Arabs.

<P>My boy, I forgot your ru&s;|ticity.
Her Lady&s;hip is one of the mo&s;t
amiable of women, and I, the happie&s;t of

We &s;tudy our mutual happi|ne&s;s,
and we do not <HI>ob&s;ed&eacute;</HI> one another.
We married for this very purpo&s;e, of not
living quite &s;o much together; for when
I paid my <HI>devoirs</HI> to her Lady&s;hip for a
whole &s;ea&s;on, I received her fair hand,
that we might not be obliged to appear
together in public. She has her card
parties, and receives her ma&s;ks; and I
my &s;tud, and my philo&s;ophers. A finer
&s;tud is not in England; &s;old all my

and &s;o nitred by my head &s;coundrel, that
they cocked their tails, and their coats
looked &s;leek and &s;hining when they could
not &s;tir a leg. 'Tis a maxim, Charles, with
me, that a bad hor&s;e you cannot &s;ell,
and a good one you cannot buy too
quickly. Tru&s;t me on the turf. All the

as it is in the Linnean &s;y&s;tem, but the
philo&s;opher in my &s;tables was a block|head

As for her Lady&s;hip, the la&s;t time I

and what is certain cannot pay. The
poor Marquis is in de&s;pair to &s;ettle his
lo&s;t wager, for he is a man of the mo&s;t
delicate honour. The year is clo&s;|ing;
the bewitching emigrant takes all
forms, &s;ei&s;es all hours, but plays off her
artillery in the air. Engli&s;h fle&s;h and
fat, blockade the avenues of the heart,
and in &s;uch a ca&s;e a Briton is a better
accountant than a Gaul. Heh man,
what excites your &s;urpri&s;e? Her Lady|&s;hip
has not yet equalled the Counte&s;s of
Lauragin, who when I was at Paris was the
heroine of the day. The Count's pa&s;|&s;ionate
attachment to Mademoi&s;elle Ar|noux,
the fir&s;t actre&s;s at the opera, had
become, through it's exce&s;&s;ive jealou&s;y,
mo&s;t tormenting to that enchanting wo|man.
She had returned to the Counte&s;s
the pre&s;ents &s;he received from the Count;
the&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of diamonds, a chariot,
and two children. She placed her&s;elf
<PB N="48" REF="71">
under the protection of a mini&s;ter of
&s;tate. The poor Count was in a delirium

<P>CHARLES, having promi&s;ed a &s;ilent

Sangrado, who was for giving the nation a
copious bleeding to invigorate and purify
it's con&s;titution; and Mr. Sympathy, who
had invented a new religion.</P>
<P>In&s;ulated among this conclave of mo|dern
philo&s;ophers (for &s;o each called him|&s;elf,
although &s;uch are of a very ancient
&s;tanding, whether we examine their inten|tions
or their productions) &s;at a Mr.
John&s;on, who &s;poke more by ge&s;ture
than by voice; he was expert in dove|tailing
the cha&s;ms of conver&s;ation, by a
&s;ignificant nod, or an accommodating
hem. Satire, panegyric, and epigram
were in his &s;lighte&s;t ge&s;ture. Every one
con&s;idered him as a per&s;on of con&s;idera|ble
ability, becau&s;e to their knowledge
he had given no public demon&s;tration of
his powers; and which is indeed by no
<PB N="53" REF="76">
means the happie&s;t method of acquiring
great reputation among our friends.</P>
<P>As we con&s;ider the character of the
philo&s;ophic and atrabilarious Subtile, as
neither too common to be pourtrayed,
nor too &s;ingular to want intere&s;t, we &s;hall
attempt to give the features of a cha&s;s of
men, who, in this age of political inquiry
and philo&s;ophical &s;ceptici&s;m, are of greater
importance in &s;ociety, than in any pre|ceding
period, when the &s;peculations of
philo&s;ophy were only told in whi&s;pers, or
publi&s;hed with a &s;olicitous ambiguity, a
ca&s;trated vigour, and an involuntary de|corum;
in a word, when the human mind
was only &s;hown in an imperfect profile,
ill expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;en&s;ations that ani|mate
every particular mu&s;cle of it's full
face.</P>
<P>Subtile, like another Marius, exulted
that he &s;prang from the dregs of the peo|ple.
A minute accident gave the world
this philo&s;opher, as well as the greater
<PB N="54" REF="77">
number of its revolutions, its temporary
fermentations, and its perennial benefits.
By the &s;tall of the father of Subtile (who
was an hone&s;t retailer of meat) daily pa&s;|&s;ed
the coach of the Bi&s;hop of that dio|ce&s;e,
who it could not be forgotten, was
the &s;on of a baker. As certain as the
Bi&s;hop pa&s;&s;ed, the &s;en&s;orium of this ho|ne&s;t
man, combined two ideas, hot rolls,
and Cardinal Wol&s;ey; the fir&s;t by retro|gre&s;&s;ion,
relating to the Bi&s;hop; the &s;e|cond
by progre&s;&s;ion, to his &s;on. To
Oxford was Subtile &s;ent, at the volun|tary
&s;acrifice of tho&s;e &s;ecret comforts of
life, which may be found more uninter|ruptedly
in the &s;hed of indu&s;try, than in
the paace of epi&s;copacy. His father
lived to &s;ee his &s;on a curate, with an in|come
which his &s;tall would have trebled.
Farmers and other provinciali&s;ts, who
conceive no per&s;on in the world more
con&s;iderable than their Bi&s;hop, their
<PB N="55" REF="78">
Lama of Tartary, and who originally
aro&s;e from a &s;tock as humble as their
own, too frequently give the church a
rebellious &s;on, while their town lo&s;es an
u&s;eful citizen. No cla&s;s of men are
rendered more di&s;&s;atisfied in the&s;e good
realms, than country curates, who are
almo&s;t fami&s;hed into athei&s;m, and who,
in the di&s;organization of a people, would
&s;eek their fir&s;t triumph in the flames of
epi&s;copal roofs.</P>
<P>Subtile was no idler; he had exalted
his imagination with certain romances,
vulgarly termed the Roman hi&s;tories;
and with an inten&s;e delight for &s;pecula|tive
notions, plunged far and wide into
the interminable di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of metaphy|&s;ics.
Talents, like his, merit an encou|ragement
they do not ea&s;ily find. He
wrote &s;ermons for Bi&s;hops, who, with a
revenue which it &s;eems an impiety for a
Chri&s;tian pa&s;tor to accept, would only pay
<PB N="56" REF="79">
for them as if they had been merely tran&s;|criptions.
He therefore, by no difficult
tran&s;ition of &s;entiment, became indi&s;po&s;|ed
again&s;t ecle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments;
told the public &s;o in an unorthodox
pamphlet, by which he lo&s;t his cure, pri|vately.
Something &s;imilar is the &s;ecret
hi&s;tory of many of tho&s;e fugitive per|formances
which few have any cau&s;e to
remember but their author; not but
that &s;ometimes a pamphlet has written a
curate into a bi&s;hoprick. The pittance
of a daily meal was now denied the phi|lo&s;ophical
par&s;on. As his father's cleaver
di&s;mally &s;ounded on the block, it &s;eemed
to in&s;ult his indignant feelings; there was
an agony in the ab&s;traction of his rumi|nations;
he thought that like a poi&s;oned
rat he had withdrawn into his hole to die.
What remained? Could a metaphy&s;ician
de&s;cend to put on a blue apron, and
&s;plit calves-heads?</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="80">
He quitted the paternal roof without
the affection of a &s;on. The hopele&s;s fa|ther
&s;unk into de&s;pondence; the poor man
for&s;ook the block he had &s;truck for forty
years, and died in the workhou&s;e of that
pari&s;h, of which he once almo&s;t imagined
his &s;on the dioce&s;an. And all this, and what
evil is to follow, aro&s;e from the pecuniary
illiberality of Bi&s;hops, who would only
pay for original &s;ermons, as more tran&s;|criptions.
Man is &s;o frequently the agent
of impelling circum&s;tances, that had the
Bi&s;hops proved more generous, and Sub|tile
more fortunate, we doubt not that
the philo&s;opher had devoted his talents
in favour of the very cau&s;e of which he
was afterwards &s;o redoubtable an adver|&s;ary.
It is thus man is influenced by
the coincidences of human events, and
thus varies from year to year, according
to new intere&s;ts and new hopes.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="81">
London is the re&s;ource of the country.
Subtile arrived in the metropolis, re&s;o|lutely
pur&s;uing a &s;y&s;tem, which, directed
by a mind of fortitude, and a heart with|out
pa&s;&s;ions, confers on it's follower &s;ome
proud delights, of too fine a &s;pirit to be
ta&s;ted by gro&s;&s;er organs. He now ad|dicted
him&s;elf to literary pur&s;uits; the
enjoyment of opulence, the wealth of
poverty, and the glory of genius.</P>
<P>Subtile was &s;uperior to the profe&s;&s;ion
he a&s;&s;umed; for &s;oon he di&s;covered that
literature was one of the numerous trades
of London, and that tho&s;e who were
bankrupts in all others, attempted to
enrich them&s;elves in this. He found that
Newgate was the Parna&s;&s;us of the age;
and &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;hment and contempt,
that men incapable of every thing, con|ceived
them&s;elves able to in&s;truct others
in all things; that many compo&s;ed hi&s;to|ries
<PB N="59" REF="82">
without the <HI>materia hi&s;torica,</HI> the
echo of an echo, the &s;hade of a &s;hadow;
and that the mo&s;t illiterate were at lea&s;t
editors of Cyclopedias. Even tho&s;e light
and charming compo&s;itions, the recreations
of men of ta&s;te, and the &s;olace of the &s;tu|dious,
he &s;aw were the aliment of the
wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions; a brutal licentiou&s;ne&s;s
that lifted the veil of dome&s;tic quietude,
and in the plea&s;ure grounds of literature,
by their brilliancy and their venom, re|&s;embled
the deadly night&s;hade. Far more
innocent, did Subtile exclaim, is the low
rabble of literature, tho&s;e poor devils,
who make u&s;e of the pockets of their
neighbours, as their own; your abridgers,
and compilers. From me (he cried, in
a virtuous enthu&s;ia&s;m) the dignity of
literature &s;hall receive no degradation.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of his &s;tudies had formed
an intellectual phy&s;iognomy. Whether
genius, in poli&s;hed ages like the pre&s;ent,
<PB N="60" REF="83">
be the impul&s;e of nature, or the imper|ceptible
gradation of art, is a literary en|quiry
of greater curio&s;ity than utility;
&s;ince to him who with ince&s;&s;ant and inten&s;e
plea&s;ure per&s;i&s;ts in any &s;tudy, with pa|tience
to examine, and with habit to
combine; &s;entiments and images will ari&s;e,
and he will at length attain that facility
and charm of performance which is deno|minated
genius. Subtile devoted his
days and his nights to the &s;tudy of me|taphy&s;ics;
and his literary indu&s;try was
at length rewarded with that perfection
of talent which is de&s;ignated by the term,
of metaphy&s;ical genius; &s;ubtilty, acute|ne&s;s,
and profundity, without imagination,
&s;en&s;ibility, and amenity.</P>
<P>From the unmetaphy&s;ical conver&s;a|tions
and irregular arguments of ordi|nary
&s;ociety, he &s;ought a voluntary &s;e|clu&s;ion.
He practi&s;ed, in great perfec|tion,
the virtues of a &s;implicity of man|ners,
<PB N="61" REF="84">
an habitual veracity, and an ex|treme
frugality; the &s;tern virtues of a
haughty poverty. His pen, cha&s;te in its
labours, was polluted by no infamous
traffic of his ideas; he meditated on the
&s;ublime philo&s;ophy of Antoninus, the
conden&s;ed and &s;ententious moralities of
Seneca, and the unimpa&s;&s;ioned and pa|tient
&s;ortitude of Epictetus; but he
thought too favourably of a frivolous
age, when he imagined that we de&s;ired
only to be in&s;tructed. The petty re|&s;ource
derived from one of our literary
journals, was more productive than the
united wi&s;dom of Seneca and Epic|tetus.</P>
<P>Ten years he con&s;umed in a &s;olitary
garret, in a &s;tate partaking more of intel|lect
than of &s;en&s;e. He learnt to rea&s;on,
but he forgot to feel. An habitual me|lancholy
pervaded his gloomy habits.
His acrid blood, and rigid nerves, were
<PB N="62" REF="85">
agitated by no &s;weet emotions; he knew
not the &s;oftening confidence of love, nor
the cheerful con&s;olations of friend&s;hip;
but he calculated the pa&s;&s;ions, and judged
them when they hardened into immobi|bity;
that is, he viewed them when they
cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>To arrange the va&s;t diver&s;ities of na|ture
into the contraction of a &s;y&s;tem, to
methodize what is &s;pontaneous, and to
attempt to enumerate all its endle&s;s va|rieties,
formed his &s;ublime occupation,
and his &s;olitary amu&s;ement. Man was
adapted to his &s;y&s;tem, which is much
ea&s;ier than to adapt a &s;y&s;tem to man.
He peopled the world with Subtiles, and
traced its government according to the
legi&s;lation ob&s;erved in the Utopia of his
garret.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that immoderate rea&s;on
can really become actual in&s;anity? Can
the whole&s;ome cup of rea&s;on overflow
<PB N="63" REF="86">
with its gelid beverage, inflame with its
frigidity, and, like ice-water, taken in
exce&s;&s;ive quantities, will it heat? Sub|tile
in his di&s;mal retreat, was in a &s;imilar
&s;ituation with the religious vi&s;ionary,
who&s;e prolific and atrabilarious fancy,
procreates a mon&s;ter brood, which feed
and gorge on the entrails of their mo|ther;
that &s;pecies of infanity which takes
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the melancholy being, who
&s;evered from all human intere&s;ts, yields
it&s;elf with phrenetic fervour to one &s;oli|tary
and bewitching contemplation. With
a fearle&s;s hand he drew a circle round
nature, and became that unrea&s;onable be|ing
who reduced every thing to the line
and compa&s;s of human rea&s;on; and with
whom to vary in opinion was to wander in
error. An emphatic monotony, gigantic
ideas, and hyperbolical truths formed his
genius, his rigid mind could not change its
<PB N="64" REF="87">
attitude; but, firm and ma&s;&s;y, made every
thing yield to its &s;uperior pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>He con&s;idered all objects, material and
intellectual, as only modifications of the
&s;ame univer&s;al matter; as &s;o many pieces
of mechani&s;m to be arranged and put to|gether
by the arti&s;t. He was a kind of
cabinet-maker of the works of nature,
and &s;aid, of this may be formed a table,
and of that a chair; this man &s;hall be
a general, and that the hi&s;torian who is
to record his battles. Thus a kingdom,
like a hou&s;e, may be furni&s;hed with pro|priety;
but at pre&s;ent our &s;y&s;tems of go|vernment
are &s;uch, that we are compelled
to &s;it on any thing becau&s;e we have not
provided &s;ufficient chairs.</P>
<P>Every object placed in a con&s;picuous
&s;ituation was his abhorrence. The pro|&s;perity
of the great &s;eemed to in&s;ult the
melancholy reclu&s;e. His genius, &s;om|brous
<PB N="65" REF="88">
and &s;ublime, con&s;idered &s;uperiority
as oppre&s;&s;ion. His notion of order was
not gradation, but equality; and as he
fancied (according to the &s;y&s;tem of mo|dern
phy&s;ics) that every mountain in na|ture
was a deformity, an accidental ex|cre&s;cence,
an elevation ari&s;ing from the
inundation that fell on other parts, he
carried this pernicious principle into po|litical
and moral &s;cience; and could not
patiently &s;uffer a Sovereign, or a God.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic habits of Subtile had
all the &s;ullen fortitude and the gloomy
ferocity of an ancient Stoic; for him&s;elf
he felt as little as for others; and there
are occa&s;ions when the ab&s;ence of &s;en&s;i|bility
looks like the mo&s;t refined feeling.
He, like the Roman parent, would have
condemned that &s;on whom the grateful
voice of his country had ab&s;olved. Ab|&s;tracted
from all terrene concerns, he
paced along the &s;treets in uninterrupted
<PB N="66" REF="89">
cogitation; with a firm &s;tep and an ele|vated
countenance, he &s;eemed gazing ei|ther
at the heavens, or reading the pen|dulous
&s;hop-&s;igns. No philo&s;opher of
Laputa could &s;tand in more need of the
attendance of a faithful flapper, to rattle
his bladder with dried pea&s;e again&s;t his
mouth when he was to &s;peak, or again&s;t
his ear when he was to li&s;ten. Ab&s;ent
amid&s;t the petty accidents of life, he
would commence a philo&s;ophical di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion
under a gutter that poured on him
its regular current, and afterwards remark
the heavy rain that had fallen. He en|countered
a thou&s;and mi&s;chances in the
&s;treets; for London, the fitte&s;t &s;pot on
earth to meditate <HI>on,</HI> is the mo&s;t unfit
to meditate <HI>in:</HI> an enraged bull is the
mo&s;t intrepid controver&s;iali&s;t a logician
can meet; and the mo&s;t perplexing di|lemma
is a hor&s;e which near you is
made, by the ingenuity of his rider, to
<PB N="67" REF="90">
go at once backwards and forwards, and
&s;ideways: a porter cru&s;hes a philo&s;opher
like an elephant that carries a ca&s;tle:
the flying whips of carmen cut like the
biting &s;courge of the &s;atiri&s;t: the chim|ney-&s;weeper,
&s;able as Pluto; the hair-dre&s;&s;er,
rapid as Mercury; and the pav|iour,
thundering as Jove, form a few of
the anti-philo&s;ophical embarra&s;&s;ments of
London. In &s;uch ca&s;ualties Subtile's
mania of rea&s;oning gave a &s;emblance of
gentlene&s;s to his feelings, which was fo|reign
to his heart; and when once run
over by a furious coachman, who broke
his leg, he only attempted to oppo&s;e his
dialectic to the brutality of the driver.
He was de&s;irous only of puni&s;hing the
criminal by the perplexities of a regu|lar
&s;yllogi&s;m; and when carried home,
&s;aid, &startq;That man will never again run
over a fellow-citizen. To reform, we
have only to rea&s;on; to puni&s;h is to

aggravate. No man commits a crime

<P>The malicious wit of Swift has failed in this great and cynical performance. It degrades not his own &s;pecies, and forms a tacit compliment to humanity. When he de&s;ired to de&s;cribe a &s;uperior order of beings, he found him&s;elf con&s;trained to give them all the noble qualities of man. Men are Yahoos only when they cea&s;e to be men; and Houyhnhnms are only humane philo&s;ophers. The &s;uppo&s;ed fact proves that the mo&s;t admirable of known beings mu&s;t be Man.</P>
<P>And if it be true, as Swift &s;eems to conceive, and our London philo&s;ophers affirm, that the follies and vices of men proceed only from their ignorance, a &s;ermon, and not a &s;atire, was required to <HI>exhort,</HI> and not to <HI>cha&s;ti&s;e.</HI> The work of Swift is therefore un|generous and incon&s;equential.</P>
<P>But a&s;&s;uredly it is not true, that <HI>ignorance</HI> is the only &s;ource of vice. Some of the mo&s;t enlightened men have been the tyrants of the world.

Subtile was perhaps not of this cla&s;s;
for as men of the world, who culti|vate

<P>WHAT we now give will have more
the appearance of a monologue
than of a dialogue, being a faithful re|pre&s;entation
<PB N="70" REF="93">
of the conver&s;ations of &s;ome
great philo&s;ophers. The interruptions of
di&s;&s;ent to the di&s;cour&s;e of a philo&s;o|pher,
is like loo&s;ening the wool of a
&s;pinning-wheel, which can never perform
its u&s;eful labour, if the &s;aid wool be
not firmly affixed to the iron &s;pindle.</P>
<P>Thus began Mr. Subtile: &startq;The work I
<PB N="71" REF="94">
propo&s;e to publi&s;h is intituled,&endq; &startq;Preju|dices
De&s;troyed, or Paradoxes Proved.&endq;
My motto may be this French ver&s;e:
<Q>&startq;Et nous ferons un bruit, &agrave; rendre les gens &s;ourds.&endq;</Q>
Which may mean, that &s;uch will be the
force of the conviction we leave on the
minds of our readers, that they &s;hall
be deaf to the arguments of our op|ponents.</P>
<P>&startq;Citizen Lord Belfield (this was a title
<PB N="72" REF="95">
of compromi&s;e between the equally ob|&s;tinate
prejudices of the nobleman and
the philo&s;opher) &s;ome will marvel, and
&s;ome will &s;tart at the &s;ingularity of its
doctrines. Twenty tedious years of au|thor&s;hip
and critic&s;hip have taught me
the principles of human nature and li|terary
compo&s;ition; how to intere&s;t the
imagination, how to conduct the un|der&s;tanding,
and how to variegate with
the colouring gleams of a &s;pecious, a
novel, a confounding ratiocination.</P>
<P>I &s;hall depo&s;it in the bo&s;om of friend|&s;hip,
the &s;ecrets of my art, becau&s;e we
cannot now have too many arti&s;ts. Every
opinion that can be promulgated has
an affirmative and a negative, both, to
an ingenious mind, &s;ufficiently accom|panied
by &s;ome probabilities; he who
would di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf <HI>adopts generally
the negative,</HI> and accommodates the un|known
and intangible nature of the in|comprehen&s;ible,
<PB N="73" REF="96">
with the more familiar
and vi&s;ible line of po&s;&s;ibility. Hence
there are certain notions which few have
ventured to promulgate; becau&s;e hi|therto,
in their mo&s;t temerarious efforts,
they have &s;topped at probabilities, while
only with the labour of one &s;tep more,
I enter the glittering &s;cenes of po&s;&s;ibi|lities;
another leap tran&s;ports me into
a fairy land, where, expatiating freely,
I trace tho&s;e half-perceptible objects con|cealed
by their own tenuity, or marvel|lous
by their own immen&s;ity; now &s;e|ductively
bright, now awfully ob&s;cure;
in a word, I luxuriate in all the poe|try
of philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>And ob&s;erve farther, we cannot be
too adventurous; <HI>no po&s;tulata are too bold
to advance.</HI> When a philo&s;opher can|not
accompany his new opinion with
any rea&s;onable degree of probability, he
informs us, that he leaves it to time to
<PB N="74" REF="97">
ripen the germ his bold hand has thrown<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is curious to ob&s;erve, that in this in&s;tance the modern philo&s;ophers imitate the mode which Je&s;us adopted at the earlie&s;t propagation of Chri&s;|tianity. &startq;He declared from the beginning it would not be generally received. He compared it to a trea&s;ure hid in a field; to a grain of mu&s;tard, which in time would grow up to a tree; and al&s;o to leaven hid in a large quantity of meal, by which the whole was in due time to be leavened and improved. But at what period the completion of his great purpo&s;e was to be effected, he has not di&s;clo&s;ed.&endq; The&s;e are the words of Mr. Bryant, in his treati&s;e on the Chri&s;tian religion, p. 211. He adds, &startq;That the religion of Chri&s;t <HI>is going on.</HI>&endq; Right glad am I to hear this cheerful familiarity from this good old man. It is the religion of an hone&s;t man; and I only lament, that I have not met with one Chri&s;|tian &s;ince I have known what Chri&s;tianity really is.</NOTE>.
This can never fail. In the cour&s;e of
&s;ome years, &s;peculative men gather all
the probabilities they can, to accom|pany
this &s;olitary, and as yet un&s;up|ported
opinion; for, as my preceding
<PB N="75" REF="98">
regulation has &s;hewn, every opinion has,
though not immediately perhaps found
out, its po&s;&s;ibilities. When once the&s;e
curious and &s;ubtile po&s;&s;ibilities are drawn
together, then is it that we revive the
exploded extravagancies of the fir&s;t in|ventor.
Hence what appears the in&s;a|nity
of imagination in Helvetius or Mi|rabeau,
becomes authorized in me and
my friend Reverberator. We in our
turn add our extravagant fancies, which
&s;ome of our po&s;terity will alike &s;upport.
Thus from age to age extravagancies are
culled, renovated, and added; and all
this produces an age of rea&s;on!</P>
<P>Another and la&s;t &s;ecret, to which I
intreat your attention, is the variety of
deductions which we may form by an
application of the &s;ingle word IF. I
have compo&s;ed an elaborate di&s;&s;ertation
on IF. In metaphy&s;ics, it is a pick|lock
which opens every door oppo&s;ed to
<PB N="76" REF="99">
our &s;y&s;tem. I &s;hall give you an in&s;tance
in point: Suppo&s;e I de&s;ire to prove that
man does not differ from a hor&s;e, I &s;hould
effect this by a &s;ingle IF; mark me! IF
nature, in place of hands and flexible
fingers, had terminated our fi&s;ts by the
hoof of a hor&s;e, who will doubt that men
without art, without habitations, with|out
a protection again&s;t other animals,
occupied entirely in procuring food, and
&s;hunning brutes of greater ferocity, would
not &s;till have wandered in fore&s;ts like
other fugitive herds?<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Helvetius, L'E&s;prit, vol. I. p. 2.</NOTE> Never forget,
when you wi&s;h to dazzle by novelty, to
employ an IF. We now proceed to the
analy&s;is of our great work.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t po&s;tulatum is, public in|tere&s;t
is the &s;ole te&s;t of virtue. 'Tis
&s;imple, as all &startq;fir&s;t principles&endq; &s;hould be,
but the deductions are quite my own.
<PB N="77" REF="100">
Hence I prove, that gratitude is a vice.
Your friend has effected for you &s;ome e&s;|&s;ential
&s;ervice; you would return the &s;ame;
and this repayment of benefits may be
prejudicial to the public good; hence
you &s;acrifice to your benefactor the duty
you owe to virtue, or the public intere&s;t.
Why &s;hould we be grateful? Gratitude
is a &s;oleci&s;m in the language of rea&s;on.
No man can confer on me <HI>a favour,</HI> but
only do me a <HI>right</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Godwin on Political Ju&s;tice, vol. I. 137, $word$.</NOTE>. You under&s;tand
me; by &s;uch principles I &s;uppo&s;e, that
the famous age of rea&s;on has already taken
place; that univer&s;al illumination per|vades
all cla&s;&s;es; and that all the varieties
of human tempers and human intere&s;ts
are re&s;olved into one general apathy of
congealing Stoici&s;m. I may have ante|dated
my period by ten centuries; but
we mu&s;t begin, or we &s;hall never con|clude.
<PB N="78" REF="101">
If a man therefore &s;aves my life.
I feel no obligation; it is the public.
Nor need I return the benefit, for the
fellow may de&s;erve to be hanged.</P>
<P>Here Mr. John&s;on gave a loud hem&punc;</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it may al&s;o be &s;aid (continued
Subtile) that gratitude is dependant on
the memory; &s;ome may forget to re|member,
and &s;ome may remember to
forget. Who can &s;plit this hair? Mo|tives
are in&s;crutable.</P>
<P>Next follows my chapter on promi&s;es.
All morality depends on ju&s;tice. Simple
principle again; but the deduction is
mine. Promi&s;es are obligations to per|form
what I ought to perform without
a promi&s;e, or it is not proper to perform.
It may be &s;aid, how can a per&s;on know
whether I will join with him in &s;ome fu|ture
concern, if I do not give him my
immediate con&s;ent. Mark my exact
words. &startq;Let beings rational and intelli|gent,
<PB N="79" REF="102">
act as if they were rational and in|telligent,
and the affairs of the world can
be carried on, without the intervention
of promi&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>Here Mr. John&s;on gave another hem,
and a $od.</P>
<P>Subtile continued: You under&s;tand
me; &s;till &s;uppo&s;ing the age of rea&s;on, and
that when a man is de&s;ired to act at the
moment, two things will certainly take
place; powerful arguments to induce him,
and di&s;cernment in him to comprehend
their propriety. All is &s;ecure in this
chapter; for I have made &s;uch numerous
and nice di&s;tinctions, between perfect and
imperfect promi&s;es, that few will under|take
to controvert, what will not ea&s;ily be
under&s;tood by any.</P>
<P>Then &s;ucceeds my chapter on property,
or the making u&s;e of the &s;uper&s;luities of
others. Property is &s;acred.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="103">
Lord Belfield wiped his face with his
handkerchief.</P>
<P>But if I want money, and you have a
&s;uper&s;luity, of which I am in that ca&s;e a
better judge than you, I then po&s;&s;e&s;s a
ju&s;t right, on the grand principle of
equality, to &s;eize from your ma&s;s, what|ever
my nece&s;&s;ities may urge.</P>
<P>Here Lord Belfield, in an irre&s;olute
tone of voice, reque&s;ted to know in what
manner our legi&s;lator would &s;eize on this
property? To which the great philo&s;o|pher
replied, fir&s;t pre&s;&s;ing his no&s;e with
his fore finger, and rai&s;ing half an eye on
his Lord&s;hip:</P>
<P>Di&s;tinguo! If I take more than is ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
I &s;teal; but I am and mu&s;t be the
&s;ole judge of my own nece&s;&s;ities. All &s;uper|fluous
property is an open common.&mdash;'Tis
mine&mdash;'tis your's&mdash;'tis the public's.</P>
<P>Yes, bur&s;t forth Mr. Reverberator, the
only method will be to re&s;cind the word
<PB N="81" REF="104">
property, from the dictionary of human
rea&s;on. It has been foi&s;ted in by &s;tock|holders,
contractors, and monopoli&s;ts; an
hone&s;t poor man could never have con|ceived
the ridiculous notion.</P>
<P>Subtile ordered attention. In the pre|&s;ent
defective &s;tate of &s;ociety, the modes
of &s;eizing on this &s;uper&s;luous property are
various. Some, who are compelled to
labour, take it in &s;alaries; &s;ome, who are
good for nothing el&s;e, accept it in pen|&s;ions;
&s;ome, who are profu&s;e of promi&s;es,
or di&s;&s;ert on gratitude, &s;lip their hands in
your pur&s;e before your fa&s;cinated eyes,
without danger of pro&s;ecution. Some,
who know as yet but little of philo&s;ophy,
take it on foot, and &s;ome on hor&s;eback.
A virtuous republican would act like
Eudemidas, to one friend bequeath his
family, and to another the payment of his
debts. It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the advan|tages
that mu&s;t re&s;ult from this proceeding.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="105">
But the di&s;covery I have made on ano|ther
&s;ubject, apparently the mo&s;t trivial
of all human occurrences, makes me
&s;hudder.</P>
<P>Lord Belfield, rather agitated by the
preceding one on property, enquired with
quickne&s;s what that was?</P>
<P>Subtile replied with his accu&s;tomed
&s;olemnity of voice&mdash;denying your&s;elf
when at home. I would not commit
&s;uch a crime if a bailiff demanded ad|mittance.
It is a national &s;y&s;tem of lying
and impudence; vices which bring hone&s;t
citizens to the gallows; which word gal|lows,
brings me to my chapter on Puni&s;h|ments.
How, think you, I puni&s;h cri|minals?</P>
<P>Lord Belfield ob&s;erved that the guillo|tine
was expeditious.</P>
<P>Mr. Dragon, his eyes reddening, his
face &s;welling, his fi&s;t clenched, exclaimed,
Keep that, Subtile, for the &s;tinking &s;tiff|necked
<PB N="83" REF="106">
ari&s;tocracy; for tho&s;e fugitives
who &s;hall e&s;cape the general ma&s;&s;acre.</P>
<P>Subtile replied: Mr. Dragon, I incul|cate
no tumults, no ma&s;&s;acres. Change
<HI>ideas,</HI> &s;o that men may thus be compelled
to accede to our opinions. But &s;uffer
not the rods of a Roman lictor to &s;hed,
like dropping tears, the blood of one
citizen.</P>
<P>Dragon gave a hideous grin, &s;triking
his knee with his clenched fi&s;t, and mut|tering
that blood, blood was the cement
of true liberty; and that he knew &s;ome of
the greate&s;t patriots of France, males and
females, who knocked down their two
dozen of ari&s;tocrats before dinner.</P>
<P>Subtile continued: I puni&s;h criminals,
by no puni&s;hments at all. Every vice is
only ignorance; merely an erroneous cal|culation
of the mind<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Thus al&s;o Mr. Holcro&s;t, &startq;The tendency of man is to promote his own well-being, and the well-being of the creatures around him; the&s;e can only be promoted by virtue; con&s;equently when he is <HI>vicious</HI> it is from <HI>mi&s;take,</HI> and his original &s;in is ignorance.&endq; Hugh Trevor, vol. i. 170.</P>

De la Beaumelle was the writer of the Memoirs of Madame De Maintenon. His &s;en&s;orium was a volcano of modern philo&s;ophy, and its explo&s;ions were heard in a little volume in|titled &startq;Mes Pen&s;ees.&endq; Had he lived latterly, he would have been a worthy compeer of Robe&s;pierre. His book has been printed in a &s;ingularly ca&s;trated manner, having &s;ometimes merely the fir&s;t &s;yllables of words. He &s;eems to have delighted in the idea that France would &s;oon have its Charles I. He has a thought on the &s;ame &s;ubject as Mr. Godwin, and it is this: &startq;A republic founded by Cartouche, would have had wi&s;er laws than the republic of Solon, and perhaps more rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;es than tho&s;e of the Ro|mans.&endq; p. 82, &s;eventh edition.

<P>Having proved the infinite perfectibi|lity
of mind, I come to that of the human
organs. Mind, as Franklin &s;ays (and
many ancients and many moderns) will at
length prevail over body. What is meant
is extremely &s;imple, or extremely my&s;te|rious;
I prefer the latter. In &s;ome twen|ty,
or forty, or &s;ixty centuries, this earth,
if it la&s;ts &s;o long (of which I have my
doubts, &s;ince Mr. Her&s;chel a&s;&s;ures me,

either &s;uddenly crack, or gradually di&s;|&s;olve,

the poles, I am afraid, are getting flatter

will be peopled by another order of be|ings;
pure intelligences that will pro|create
by &s;elf-impregnations. De&s;cartes
thought that we might prolong life for
two or three centuries, and when one of
his di&s;ciples heard of his death, it took
him two years before he could believe it.
Bi&s;hop Wilkins, who di&s;covered the art
of aereal navigation, had no doubt that in
a few years men would as commonly call
for their wings, as they did for their

That morning I di&s;covered an air, which
has yet no name; I perforated a tumbler
with a &s;mall orifice, placed my three flies

the other poured in the &s;tream of this
namele&s;s air. At fir&s;t I &s;aw, or &s;eemed
to &s;ee a kind of motion. My eye pored,

&s;tirred, &s;hrunk, and &s;tarted; the entire

the &s;tomach and the inte&s;tines took their
proper place, and at length when the
tracheae, and the parts of generation of the
little flies, were &s;ufficiently heated, nature
was re&s;tored to all her rights. They
moved, I moved; they climbed on the
&s;ide of the tumbler, I dropped the micro|&s;cope;
they lifted them&s;elves in air, I lifted

Mr. Sympathy, (who we have ob&s;erved

great agitation, addre&s;&s;ed the metaphy&s;i|cian:</P>
<P>Mr. Subtile, you mean this non-ex|i&s;tence
of God only as a <HI>per&s;onal at|tack

with &s;uch a demon&s;tration! At
this moment, when the ground is pur|cha&s;ed
for my univer&s;al church; my
&s;ub&s;criptions rapidly filling, and my
quarto, proving the exi&s;tence of a God,
on the eve of publication! Be&s;ides, gen|tlemen,
Subtile violates the &s;olemn com|pact
<PB N="93" REF="116">

propo&s;ed writing down all monarchy,
Subtile informed me that he was em|ployed

I, to you I re&s;ign the affairs of the &s;tate,
provided, in return, I have all tho&s;e of the

Lot. If thou goe&s;t to the right, I will
to the left. From that hour, I con&s;idered
all eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters as much my own,
as does the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.
And ju&s;t at the moment my book
and my church are coming out, he pub|li&s;hes
this demon&s;tration. Ob&s;erve how
an envious philo&s;opher can violate his
promi&s;es!</P>
<P>Socrates, in his ba&s;ket, &s;u&s;pended in
the air for the benefit of undi&s;turbed

Subtile in his chair. As if &s;carcely at|tending
to the rage of Mr. Sympathy, he
replied with calm dignity; As for pro|mi&s;es,

my chapter on them. I grieve to
&s;ee a citizen preferring to the public il|lumination

univer&s;al religion.</P>
<P>Dr. Bounce, hitherto &s;ilent, &s;tarted up
in an explo&s;ion of rage. Imagine to your|&s;elf
the &s;hape of Dr. Slop, the fat of par&s;on
Trulliber, put on an immoderate bu&s;hy wig,

eyes, glowing like two of Argand's lamps
through their clear gla&s;s; cheeks, full as
tho&s;e of Aeolus, when he blows his la&s;t
puff in a rage; a mannikin of about four
feet in height, and two in breadth, $wirl|ing
its &s;quare obe&s;ity, rather kicking
than treading on the ground, bellowing
like a young bull.&mdash;But before we pro|ceed&punc;

the &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ub&s;criptions of Sympathy,
a&s;&s;ociating with the idea of the ea&s;y &s;eats

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Rout.</HEAD>
<P>TO delineate the thoughts of Charles,
as he &s;tept into bed, is what we can|not
now attempt; his mind was involved
in ob&s;curity, every new object added per|plexity
to perplexity, and he even &s;u&s;|pected
that the &s;y&s;tems he had adopted
from his youth might po&s;&s;ibly not be le&s;s
ab&s;urd. Such is the fir&s;t &s;tate of a mind,
that, partially enlightened, &s;ees much and
comprehends little; and, if ingenuous,

<P>When Ari&s;totle &s;ays, that the <HI>beginning</HI> of wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in doubting, there is little danger to be in|curred in this principle; but much, if the <HI>end</HI> of wi&s;dome it is agreed can to go no further, which has been the folly of &s;ome wi&s;e men.</P></NOTE>

and habitual apathy; or patiently inve&s;ti|gating
the phenomena of human life, per|fects
its ob&s;ervations, arranges the facts
it a&s;&s;embles, and takes a human intere&s;t
in whatever relates to humanity. Be|tween
the glowing reveries of a Shafte&s;|bury,
and the congealing mi&s;anthropy of
a Mandeville, Charles &s;tood poi&s;ed by
the &s;olid judgment which exerci&s;e had
fortified, and with the &s;en&s;ibility with
which nature had touched his frame.
Without any indeci&s;ion, he yet he&s;itated
to decide; for although he tru&s;ted to the
prompt energies of his heart, he yet was
not a&s;&s;ured that its &s;en&s;ations were faith|ful,
and its impul&s;es unerring.</P>
<P>Among the literary &s;ociety at Lord
Belfield's, he &s;elected only one per&s;on for
his companion, the &s;ilent Mr. John&s;on,
whom he di&s;covered to be a mo&s;t con|ver&s;ible
<PB N="99" REF="122">
per&s;on. The world is apt to ri|dicule
the friend&s;hip of a youth with a
man of advanced age; but &s;uch is nei|ther
incongruous nor unde&s;irable; youth
is not in&s;tructed by youth, age is not de|lighted
by age. The ardency of friend|&s;hip
is never, perhaps, more inten&s;e than
in tho&s;e who, united in the &s;ame habits,
are directed by an unequal experience.
An imperceptible &s;uperiority intere&s;ts
without mortifying; it is an emulation,
it is a coun&s;el, it is an aid; in whatever
form it appears to our judgment, it has
nothing of the malice of rivality. It is a
local enjoyment, of which none are more
&s;en&s;ible of its want than men of genius
and reflection. Such a friend&s;hip is the
pa&s;&s;ion of a &s;age; the only exce&s;s he dares
not di&s;approve; it is the &s;en&s;e of our ex|i&s;tence
in that of another. Such was the
union which took place between Charles
and the ob&s;erving John&s;on. Charles, with
<PB N="100" REF="123">
all the exuberance of animal &s;pirits, had
taught him&s;elf to feel more plea&s;ure in
li&s;tening than in conver&s;ing; the &s;ure&s;t
criterion of future excellence, and the
plea&s;ante&s;t kind of conver&s;ation to our
friends.</P>
<P>It was now that &s;ea&s;on when the opu|lent
appear mo&s;t gay, and the poor mo&s;t
wretched; when the halls of the great are
&s;ultry as &s;ummer, while the mendicant
mourns the rigours of a heaven as unre|lenting
as man; when the flambeaux that
light the rapid chariot dart their tran&s;ient
flame over &s;ome human &s;pectres, perhaps
a mother and her infants who have retired
to &s;leep on the frozen earth, and picking
the offal-bone they find in the &s;treet, con|ceive
the thoughtle&s;s wa&s;te of luxury to
be benevolence. Now the crowded the|atres
and the &s;plendid opera have not one
elbow-place to &s;upport, nor one breath of
air to revive, an hy&s;terical beauty, alike

oppre&s;&s;ed by extreme heat and pathos.
In plainer Engli&s;h, <HI>every body</HI> was in

of &s;ociety the <HI>great world,</HI> &s;o as ju&s;tly
we &s;uppo&s;e the whole of its honourable
members to be <HI>every body.</HI> Lady Bel|field
now di&s;per&s;ed &s;everal packs of cards
of invitation, to the uninterrupted di&s;|turbance
of three adjacent &s;treets.</P>
<P>What an object for Charles was a fa|&s;hionable
rout! what a whirl for the eye
of fancy! what a labour for the head of
meditation! Three &s;pacious drawing|rooms
were thrown open; a multitude
were announced, who glided in, and &s;i|lently
took their places at a table, as if
every thing was to be conducted with the
utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy. From each flight of
&s;tairs a number of names revolved in
echoes, while the noble mi&s;tre&s;s was oc|cupied,
even to extreme fatigue, in &s;a|luting,
not her friends who entered (for
<PB N="102" REF="125">
their entrance was &s;o rapid and continuous
that a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate &s;alutation was
impo&s;&s;ible) but the echoes of confu&s;ed
names, which, had &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;he
could not ea&s;ily have fixed on their own|ers.
Above three hundred friends were
a&s;&s;embled, who, out of kindne&s;s, paid no
attention to the noble and exhau&s;ted lady.
She &s;tood among the crowd as if &s;he were
de&s;erted; her hurried intellect &s;eemed only
lodged in the ear; and her whole enter|tainment
con&s;i&s;ted in li&s;tening to the re|verberation
of names, in bowing to the
pa&s;&s;ing &s;hadows that flitted by, and in
exchanging, for a &s;hort moment, a few
di&s;tant &s;miles.</P>
<P>What an incongruity of per&s;onages!
If wit con&s;i&s;ts in an unexpected a&s;&s;ocia|tion
of remote ideas, perhaps &s;omething
like wit is felt by the mind when we ex|amine
the odd coincidencies of a rout.
Through the narrow lanes formed by the
<PB N="103" REF="126">
numerous card-tables, Charles glided at
fir&s;t with a plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment. An|tiquated
dames were the rivals of bloom|ing
virgins. Cards, like death, level all,
and &s;pread an univer&s;al &s;ilence. In the
ab&s;traction of Whi&s;t, and the complexity
of Ca&s;&s;ino, the &s;en&s;e of beauty &s;eemed
lo&s;t in the men, and the charms of lo|quacious
elegance in the women. At
length this mute exhibition cea&s;ed to in|tere&s;t.
S$d, it appeared to Charles, to
view grey-headed Folly enquiring, with
a bewildered air, for the trumps; and
while his fever was only vi&s;ible in his
hollow eyes, &s;eeming to forget his chalky
hands and flannel feet. Plea&s;ant was the
&s;pectacle, to ob&s;erve little girls directing
their pal&s;ied grandmothers in &s;orting the
cards and numbering the fi&s;h, while their
little bo&s;oms, trembling with a pious af|fection
for their parents, often by a glance
became more u&s;eful auxiliaries than the
<PB N="104" REF="127">
tenderne&s;s of their years &s;eemed to pro|mi&s;e.
Painful to the eye of Charles&punc;
to ob&s;erve &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful
countenances in Europe di&s;torted with
the hideous pa&s;&s;ions, or a&s;&s;uming a ma&s;|culine
exultation. How rapid are the
lines that di&s;order the face of beauty;
how the fiery &s;hade of pa&s;&s;ion inflames
the tender vermilion of the female cheek;
and how much good-humour and &s;u$$ity
of manners are thrown away on the turn|ing
of a fooli&s;h card!</P>
<P>Tired with the monotonous &s;cene, and
one table being only the reflection of
another, Charles withdrew into a corner,
re&s;olved rather to &s;ee nothing than to
&s;uffer the iteration of unmeaning ob|jects.
Mr. John&s;on, who had ob&s;erved
his motions, came to his relief; and
&s;eating him&s;elf, &s;elected the characters
that were mo&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable, for
the amu&s;ement of his young friend.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="128">
&startq;My good friend,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;a rout
is not the unintelligent &s;cene you ima|gine.&endq;
When I look round, indeed, I
am reminded of the republic of bees,
which Buffon de&s;cribes with more inge|nuity
than philo&s;ophy; for he tells us,
that they are only ten thou&s;and automata,
a&s;&s;embled in the &s;ame place, acting pre|ci&s;ely
in the &s;ame manner; and that the
order ob&s;ervable in the &s;ociety is merely
an apparent one, for the &s;ame regularity
would take place in any other automata;
one impels the other, and therefore each,
impelling and impelled, gives a &s;em|blance
of rational order. A rout, Charles,
to a town-philo&s;opher, is as u&s;eful as
the peru&s;al of a voluminous catalogue
of books to a man of letters; it reminds
him of titles he had forgotten, and ex|cites
a recollection of their contents.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve that mo&s;t amiable of her &s;ex
on the right, and at two tables lower,
<PB N="106" REF="129">
a countenance that yields in nothing,
though a few years more of age have
dimini&s;hed its graces, while they impart
its dignity. Nature tells you they are
&s;i&s;ters. The elder is more cheerful; be|cau&s;e,
perhaps, a protracted pain that is
irremediable, dimini&s;hes that romantic
&s;en&s;ibility which di&s;tingui&s;hes her lovely
&s;i&s;ter. Alas! their diamond &s;tomacher
covers a bleeding heart; hearts that have
been violently lacerated from the ten|dere&s;t
felicity. A little further &s;its their
father; mark how &s;lowly he takes up
the tricks, and how cautiou&s;ly he lays
down his card. He is a merchant, who,
when he found his credit on the decline,
turned out his four daughters to a
&s;anctioned pro&s;titution, known by the
phra&s;e of great and honourable con|nexions.
Tho&s;e two daughters had in|terchanged
their affections with two
amiable men; but the &s;peculator found
it nece&s;&s;ary to annihilate the pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="107" REF="130">
that once he had encouraged. When
he hung on the &s;harpe&s;t verge of ruin,
he a&s;&s;umed the highe&s;t &s;tyle of living,
introduced his daughters to the fir&s;t cir|cles,
and kept his eye on our Indian
princes. We have among the imported
luxuries of the age, exhau&s;ted and pith|le&s;s
beings, who return with the rapine
of thirty years, and are only puni&s;hed by
the climate in which they effected their
depredations. They come to be married
and to be buried in England, and to
plant on their tomb &s;ome violated and
weeping ro&s;e of love. Such are the two
beings that gra&s;ped the hands, but could
not reach the hearts of tho&s;e injured
beauties. Modern fathers! Such is the
Moloch rage that &s;acrifices your children
to your ambition! This merchant, in
the freedom of Briti&s;h land, has made
an Indian market for female beauty! He
&s;till has two other &s;laves to &s;ell, whom
<PB N="108" REF="131">
he will not only &s;end away portionle&s;s,
but, by their connexions, will inflame
the radical avarice of his &s;ons, and ini|tiate
them into all the my&s;teries of com|mercial
&s;peculation. Meanwhile, I could
a&s;&s;ure the hu&s;bands of tho&s;e two young
ladies, that they con&s;ider them&s;elves in
a gloomy &s;tate of widowhood; and mourn,
at every interval of reflection, the beloved
partners of their affections, which &s;hall
not cea&s;e but with the la&s;t palpitation of
their heart.</P>
<P>Your eyes are fixed on that maje&s;tic
form; what an ea&s;y grace! what elo|quent
features! what harmonious tones!
That lady was for one winter the public
favourite on the &s;tage; the heart-thrilling
&s;i&s;ter of Thalia. She was (for her dra|matic
exi&s;tence has long cea&s;ed) one of
tho&s;e rare intelligences who can embody
the conceptions of the poet, and, chang|ing

<P>Tho&s;e two gentlemen in clo&s;e conver|&s;ation

his ver&s;e; and his port-folio, abounding
with every &s;pecies of poetry, has the
&s;ame variety as his wardrobe. He has
a &s;trong party in every fa&s;hionable cir|cle,
who buy a certain number of his
<PB N="110" REF="133">
poems, and come, in a certain number,
to his comedy or his tragedy. Some li|terary
men owe their connexions to their
reputation, but he his reputation to his
connexions. When he favours his friends
with a rehear&s;al of his manu&s;cripts, he
takes in his chariot a little Wel&s;h harp,
plays his &s;ongs to his own mu&s;ic, and
the modern min&s;trel &s;its,
<Q>&startq;Proud as Apollo on his forked hill.&endq;</Q>

<P>As for the author, he is here among a
numerous circle of patrons. He lives
<PB N="111" REF="134">
fa&s;hionably among the fa&s;hionable, and
yet pretends to derive his exi&s;tence from
his pen. Ye powers of genius! ye liberal
bounties of patronage! And yet, Charles,
the book&s;ellers know little of this great
genius. At an a&s;&s;embly like the pre&s;ent
he collects &s;ub&s;criptions now for a novel,
now for a poem, now for his travels.</P>
<P>Charles here interrupted Mr. John&s;on,
by enquiring how it was that if this writer
was de&s;titute of learning or genius, he
could collect with &s;uch facility &s;uch nu|merous
&s;ub&s;criptions?</P>
<P>John&s;on continued: Had he genius
or learning, he had not been here. One

&s;o many titles; and the re&s;t have their

I am &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee Mr. Million,

for another &s;tock, to what price he &s;hall
rai&s;e the omnium, and riots in his nume|rical
imagination, by anticipating the next
year's loan. He reali&s;es thou&s;ands for
his breakfa&s;t; and when he appears at the
Bank, his magical eye can excite as many
pa&s;&s;ions as that of Mrs. Siddons. A ge&s;|ture

<P>Something of Mr. Million's arts of
arithmetic have been greatly wanted by
that elegant man of fa&s;hion, who was &s;o
unfortunate as to come too early to his
rental; which little circum&s;tance has

his &s;en&s;e. He married, before he became of
age, a lady who had nothing but her beau|ty,
with a violent de&s;ire of di&s;tinction. He
is &s;carcely thirty, and not one &s;plendid
fragment of his fortune remains. His

lady, merely from a rage of notoriety, in|dulged
a pa&s;&s;ion for gaming in exce&s;s,
heightened every art of di&s;&s;ipation, and
invented &s;ome peculiar to her&s;elf. She
had gold ba&s;kets of bank notes brought
repeatedly in an evening; the bills of her
fancy-dre&s;&s;er annually amounted to &s;eve|ral
thou&s;ands; &s;he had numerous e&s;ta|bli&s;hments,

&s;he fed on the &s;weet hope of &s;eeing her
Baronet in the upper hou&s;e. Her hu&s;|band
was, however, a calculator, but on
a different principle from Mr. Million.
&startq;I have, &s;aid he, a net income of 15,000.

bears too high a price for either&punc;
their income is &s;carcely &s;ufficient for their

and enable them to get through the entire
bu&s;ine&s;s of their day in Bond-&s;treet. Late
ri&s;ing, &s;hort meals, and long dre&s;&s;ing, and
an evening protracted to midnight, is the
uniform nullity of their exi&s;tence. They
have made friends from the total incapa|city
of differing in opinion. To li&s;ten and
a&s;&s;ent is the only operation of their mind.
Attracted by a &s;imilarity of character and
&s;ituation, they are generally &s;een leaning
together on a chimney-piece. They &s;eem
to meet in &s;ilent plea&s;ure, occa&s;ionally a&s;|&s;i&s;ting
each other in dividing a &s;olitary
idea; for when one commences with ef|fort
to expre&s;s &s;omething like a thought,

an equal effort, attempts to aid its imper|fect

There, is a more &s;ingular character!
that young man occupies the &s;ame &s;tation

his ingenuity active; he might be a man
of genius; but, incon&s;iderate prodigal! he
exhau&s;ts his opulence on the meane&s;t ob|jects.
Science has enlightened, and, what
is more rare, ta&s;te has refined; but his
&s;cientific genius is employed on inventing
&s;hoe-latchets which clo&s;e and open by a
particular motion of the &s;$et; and he has
exhibited more indu&s;try and invention in
the manufacture of certain &s;nuff-boxes,
than would be nece&s;&s;ary to complete an
important di&s;covery in natural philo&s;o|phy.
He has ju&s;t returned from an ec|centric
excur&s;ion to Greenland, his curio|&s;ity

even in the di&s;&s;olute age of the &s;econd
Charles, relaxed not of their au&s;tere ho|ne&s;ty,
and exulted in the patrimonial dig|nity
of a long and uncorrupted line. Their
revenues were large as their virtues; and
when my Lord Duke came to their vene|rated
title, his compliances with a certain
party were con&s;idered as the conde&s;cen|tion
of affection, rather than the &s;ubjec|tion
of imbecility. He was a woodcock
for tho&s;e who make &s;pringes. Di&s;&s;ipation
was &s;pirit, caprice invention, and ab&s;urdi|ty

<PB N="123" REF="146">
the Duke? oh! he is playing at tennis with
his grooms, or &s;parring with his pugili&s;ts,
or in his theatre leaping with harlequin.
Happy had my Lord Duke been only an
idiot. It was his pride to throw at the
large&s;t &s;ums. Four of his friends re&s;olved
to &s;et him out; they mutually agreed to
play till each had ruined him&s;elf, or his
adver&s;ary. The Duke &s;ent the three fir&s;t

retired to return no more, and pre&s;ented
to conjugal affection, to filial hope, and
to anxious hone&s;ty, a bleeding cor&s;e. The
Duke was alike for&s;aken by his fortune,
and the accumulation of centuries was
di&s;&s;olved at one final throw. The&s;e are
not all his crimes&mdash;but enough. With an
unmanly con&s;olation he has &s;worn, that

Bourdaloue was nearly the Corneille of the pulpit, as Ma&s;&s;illon was afterwards the Racine. Bourdaloue was de&s;irous of arguing like Corneille, and Ma&s;&s;il|lon &s;tudied to be as elegant in pro&s;e as Racine in ver&s;e. Bourdaloue was accu&s;ed, as was Corneille, of too much rea&s;oning, too much proving in&s;tead of touching, and &s;ometimes giving but indifferent proofs; in a word they had both too much of the Pleader. Ma&s;&s;illon, on the contrary, con&s;idered that it was be&s;t to paint and to agitate; he imitated Racine as much as he could be imitated in pro&s;e. His &s;tyle is pure, and his pictures are affecting. He is a pupil who attempts to wre&s;tle with his ma&s;ter&mdash;Ma&s;&s;illon and Cheminais knew Racine by heart, and concealed the ver&s;es of this divine poet in their pious pro&s;e.</P>
<P>It was thus that many preachers were accu&s;tomed to take le&s;&s;ons of Baron the actor, in the art of decla|mation; and afterwards adju&s;ting the ge&s;ture of the player, by ge&s;tures &s;uitable to a holy orator. No|thing proves clearer, that all the arts are fraternal, although arti&s;ts are far from being &s;o.</P>

<P>&startq;Marvellous is it to me,

with the great Mr. Huntington! The
fellow is of excellent promi&s;e; &s;tout and
hale, &s;eems long-lived, and has a fi&s;t like a
Hercules. Of theological controver&s;i|ali&s;ts,
we judge generally by their corporeal
&s;tate. In the grounds of theology, this
author &s;preads about and becomes as era|dicable
<PB N="141" REF="164">
and acrid as hor&s;e-raddi&s;h; root
him out, up he &s;prings, and runs over any
ground where he is once fairly fixed. The
dog's works &s;ell, for he has two meetings,
and manages matters to admiration. In
Monckton-&s;treet, where his auditors con&s;i&s;t
of aged trade&s;men and canting old &s;i&s;ters,
with not a drop of warm blood under their
&s;hrivelled &s;kin, he rou&s;es them with groans
and &s;ighs, for the eternity of hell fires, and
his grand &s;y&s;tem is there <HI>the fear of God.</HI>
&mdash;But in Titchfield-&s;treet, a gayer part of
the town, with an audience of pretty girls
and &s;mart da&s;hers, he is luxuriant in the
joys of paradi&s;e, the fountain of bli&s;s, the
&s;ongs of Solomon, and his &s;y&s;tem there
con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>the love of God.</HI> I have a great
re&s;pect for Mr. Huntington, although he
was only a coal-heaver till gifted by the
&s;pirit, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him as well as I can in his

&s;tood without doors (as is often the ca&s;e
when he preaches) that vociferating with
&s;uch force, a di&s;mal hoar&s;ene&s;s from a &s;ore
throat has taken place; and the great

whi&s;pers.&endq;</P>
</SP>
<P>Here clo&s;ed this &s;ingular conver&s;ation;
but as Charles felt &s;till a curio&s;ity in what
related to this voluminous &s;aint, in re|turning
home John&s;on gave him a &s;ketch
of his character and his life.</P>
<P>&startq;Can we call that man a fanatic (&s;aid
John&s;on) who,&endq; from the occupation of
digging in a coal-pit, has had the &s;agacity
and the art to e&s;tabli&s;h two religious fra|ternities
of his own, and reali&s;e a con&s;ider|able
income? In his circum&s;cribed &s;pace,
<PB N="143" REF="166">
he has effected as much as Mahomet, had
he only had two &s;treets in this metropolis
at his command, could probably have
done.</P>
<P>Mr. Huntington has favoured the
world with his own life and his own
portrait; and to my ta&s;te they are more
intere&s;ting than Mr. Gilbert Wakefield's
and Mr. John Lackington's, both gentle|men
who are willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t po&s;terity by
two lives which, I am of opinion, no one
el&s;e had been &s;olicitous to write; not|with&s;tanding
Mr. Wakefield can recollect
as great a number of quotations in Greek
ver&s;e, as Mr. Lackington &s;eems to have
known in Engli&s;h; but a quotation is no|thing
but a quotation, whether in Greek
or in Engli&s;h; and Mr. Lackington is far
&s;uperior to the afore&s;aid Mr. Gilbert
Wakefield in his vernacular idiom; for not|with&s;tanding
the &s;aid Greek excerpts of the
&s;aid Gil, he compo&s;es Engli&s;h ver&s;e and
<PB N="144" REF="167">
pro&s;e in the &s;ame manner that Ari&s;totle
would him&s;elf have done, if that Grecian
had re&s;ided a few months in England.</P>
<P>&startq;For heaven's &s;ake (&s;aid Charles,&endq; in|terrupting
John&s;on) leave Wakefield
quietly among his boys. Con&s;ider
<Q><L>&startq;Pains, reading, &s;tudy, are <HI>his</HI> ju&s;t pretence,</L>
<L>And all <HI>he</HI> wants is &s;pirit, ta&s;te, and &s;en&s;e.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>John&s;on. &startq;Shall I &s;uffer in &s;ilence his
fla&s;hing and pidling&endq; of our immortal
Pope? As for his &s;hilling politics, or his
poetical libels, called tran&s;lations, I and
the world would have &s;aid nothing. But
I lo&s;e my patience, and let me own it too,
when a pedant, o&s;tentatiou&s;ly throws his
heavy offerings on the altar of the
Graces.</P>
<P>Saint Huntington pa&s;&s;ed his early
years in a coal-pit, and there to this
moment would have remained quietly,
had accident not thrown a Bible in his
<PB N="145" REF="168">
$and. With an empty &s;tomach and a
full head, the night brought vi&s;ions, and
the day in&s;pirations. When the mind is
bewitched by a religious fancy, the com|mone&s;t
incident, and the &s;lighte&s;t accident,
bear with them te&s;timonies of the election
of heaven. Mark what I have ob&s;erved;
when a man is once fairly converted, as
certain will he convert others; it is the
very precept of Horace in other words;
for what has brought conviction to one
fool, will &s;erve for the conviction of ano|ther.
Two &s;ages argue without perceiv|ing
a mutual conviction; wi&s;dom finds
innumerable impediments; when two fools
rea&s;on, the fir&s;t who begins will be cer|tain
of per&s;uading the other; folly pro|pagates
with facility. I could give you
good metaphy&s;ical rea&s;ons for this. Our
Saint's coal-pit became a conventicle. He
exulted, and emerged into light. Men,
women, and children crowded.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="169">
Huntington, be&s;ides being a great
&s;wearer, lyar, &amp;c. was as brawny as Sam|&s;on,
and as amorous as David. He had
his Dalilah and his Bath&s;heba. Satan,
di&s;gui&s;ed in the gravity of a churchwar|den,
informed him, that whatever free|dom
this country allows to be taken with
the &s;pirit, the act of parliament was &s;trong
relative to tho&s;e of the outward man.
This was the fir&s;t trial; and he confe&s;&s;es
that he was the mo&s;t inveterate of &s;inners,
eager for repetition, and carele&s;s of repen|tance;
but then, as he further ob&s;erves,
gold which is burnt &s;even times in the
furnace, lo&s;es it's alloy, and at length
comes out in all it's virgin purity.</P>
<P>When Satan, in the form of a church|warden,
di&s;appeared, Huntington flew
from his coal-pit with the wings of an
angel; that is, with rapidity and holine&s;s.
As it has been the cu&s;tom of all divine
men (probably for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to
<PB N="147" REF="170">
them&s;elves) &s;ince the time of Abraham,
when they run away, becau&s;e they are
called by the Lord, to di&s;gui&s;e by enlarg|ing
their names, &s;o did our pre&s;ent &s;aint.
Every thing, my friend, in this world is
imitation. His original name was <HI>Hunt,</HI>
which he now enlarged to that of <HI>Hunting|ton,</HI>
and for which take his rea&s;ons. <HI>Hunt,</HI>
becau&s;e I am engaged in the chace of the
wicked, or rather, as we have &s;een, the
wicked were in chace of him; <HI>ing,</HI> becau&s;e
this is the end of all wickedne&s;s, &s;uch as
&s;wearing lying, &amp;c.; and <HI>ton,</HI> becau&s;e I am
a ve&s;&s;el of the Lord.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not dwell on the vi&s;ions and ap|paritions
of Mr. Huntington, they are
minutely recorded in his life; and all that
we can learn from them is, that when once
a man begins to &s;ee vi&s;ions, like any other
habit, it grows on him. His new name,
however, was not more fortunate than it's
predece&s;&s;or; Satan pur&s;ued him from place
<PB N="148" REF="171">
to place, and always cho&s;e the &s;ame figure
of a pari&s;h guardian. Now the man grew
famous throughout the land, &startq;from Dan
even unto Beer&s;heba,&endq; that is, about a cir|cumference
of three miles. His enemies
gathered, and &s;u&s;picions &s;pread, that he was
not &startq;a going about doing good,&endq; and
<HI>merely</HI> for the <HI>propagation</HI> of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all &s;uch per&s;ecutions he bore
him&s;elf up like a man and a prophet;
that is, he has given an unblu&s;hing ac|count
of his conduct, compares him&s;elf
with David and Solomon, and returns
devout thanks that he is no wor&s;e than
they were. Our mi&s;&s;ionary e&s;tabli&s;hed a
regular thriving trade; di&s;&s;erting in pro&s;e,
and allegori&s;ing in ver&s;e, not indeed
with the fertile imagination of a Bunyan,
but with that vein of vulgar &s;en&s;e, which
to the vulgar is true eloquence.</P>
<P>A little country tabernacle was now
his pride and his ambition. He &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="149" REF="172">
in all tho&s;e divine and valuable pro|jects,
which fancy could excite in the brain
of an apo&s;tolical coal-digger. Satan now a&s;|&s;umed
another form, that of an Arian
landlord. And this was the happy origin
of his good fortune; the accidental cau&s;e
of his entering the wide field of theolo|gical
controver&s;y. He paid his rent by
writing again&s;t his landlord, and formed
the gradual, and now mature, e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of two &s;eminaries of fanatici&s;m; two
little theatres of which the receipts are
con&s;iderable, and in him&s;elf unites the
characters of manager, actor, and author.</P>
<P>&startq;I can ob&s;erve no difference&endq; &s;aid
Charles, when John&s;on concluded this nar|rative
&startq;between the fanatici&s;m of Ignorance
and the fanataci&s;m of Philo&s;ophy. Every
philo&s;ophical leader is a kind of Hunting|ton;
and every new &s;y&s;tem &s;eems to ter|minate
in &s;omething like a conventicle.
But WHERE, my friend, ARE THE HO|NEST
MEN?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="173">
To which John&s;on replied&mdash;&startq;Hone&s;t
men, Charles, are not gregarious. Ob|&s;erve
a crowd; the favourite orator is
rarely an hone&s;t man; he is only the or|gan
of a party, while the hone&s;t men, who
are too often &s;ilent, are generally con&s;i|dered
by each party, as &s;o many impedi|ments
in their way to get clo&s;er to the
orator; and in the attempt the&s;e parties
make to unite them&s;elves with him, the
hone&s;t men are pu&s;hed a&s;ide, or trampled
on, as the mercy or the ingratitude of the
multitude wills; exiled like ARISTIDES,
or torn to pieces like DE WITT.</P>

<P>THE unfortunate female, whom Charles
had relieved with a bounty, that pro|ceeded
more from the benevolence of his
heart, than the deci&s;ion of his judgment,
(for &s;till prejudice whi&s;pered in his ear the
hateful di&s;tinction of pro&s;titute) having
been de&s;ired by Charles to di&s;clo&s;e her
hi&s;tory, delivered her&s;elf in the following
plain narrative.</P>
<P>My hi&s;tory is a de&s;cription of the me|lancholy
effects of three great profe&s;&s;ions.
My late hu&s;band Mr. Wil&s;on, at the age
of forty, obtained by the favour of an
old lady, a &s;mall e&s;tate near Bridgewater.
<PB N="152" REF="175">
His life had pa&s;&s;ed in per&s;evering ob&s;e|quiou&s;ne&s;s
and anxious attention, to the
wants and de&s;ires of this aged matron.
Troy did not undergo a &s;iege more re|gular,
and more procra&s;tinated, than this
e&s;tate. He won her affections by pa&s;&s;ing
long evenings in conver&s;ation or in &s;ilence;
in never breaking the repo&s;e of her ea&s;y
naps, while &s;he admired the careful &s;ilence
of his foot&s;teps, and his curious felicity
in &s;tirring the fire, without &s;triking on the
bars of the grate. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making
embrocations, empla&s;ters, and emollients;
di&s;tilling elder flowers, compounding diet-drinks,
and once relieved the feeblene&s;s
of her &s;ight, by a fortunate application
of euphra&s;ia or eyebright. Every morn|ing
he made enquiry, if her cough had
much tickled in the night. His indu&s;try
was at length rewarded, for &s;he coughed
no more.</P>
<P>His character, which was gentlene&s;s,
<PB N="153" REF="176">
devoid of hypocri&s;y, by &s;uch means was
well adapted to obtain an e&s;tate, but
the&s;e were ill &s;uited to pre&s;erve it. The
habits of ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and a&s;&s;ent to
every opinion he heard, enervated his fa|culties;
too timorous to contradict, too
indolent to act, too indeci&s;ive to di&s;cover
the characters of men, he now found
him&s;elf &s;urrounded by beings more per|plexing,
and le&s;s placable than the old
lady, to who&s;e &s;ole quiet he had devoted
his inoffen&s;ive days. Her caprices had
given him an agreeable employment, her
&s;atisfaction was his highe&s;t happine&s;s, and
the old elbow-chair of his venerable a&s;|&s;ociate
long reminded him of plea&s;ures
that had pa&s;t, when he &s;at oppo&s;ite, and
gazed around with a heart full and &s;a|tisfied.</P>
<P>He now experienced a dome&s;tic va|cuity,
intolerable to a per&s;on who could
not &s;often the mi&s;eries of inaction, by
<PB N="154" REF="177">
tho&s;e various pur&s;uits which adorn and
exhilarate our exi&s;tence. My father
was a curate, who lived with extreme
difficulty; and when Mr. Wil&s;on was
de&s;irous of &s;upplying the place of his
ancient companion, he applied to my
father. It was a connexion above our
hopes; the di&s;&s;imilarity of our age,
could form no ob&s;tacle to the humility
of my de&s;ires; and I willingly re&s;igned
my per&s;on to a man of inoffen&s;ive di&s;po|&s;itions,
who I well knew never to have
made an enemy.</P>
<P>We had &s;carcely been happy a few
months, when, to our mutual &s;urpri&s;e,
we perceived that Mr. Wil&s;on had one,
as implacable as he was formidable.
E&s;quire Bu&s;tle had ju&s;t arrived from
London to re&s;ide on his e&s;tate, and it
was &s;oon di&s;covered that he was jealous
to exce&s;s of his manerial rights. He
had a cou&s;in in London, an attorney,
<PB N="155" REF="178">
who had drawn up his will; and as a
mark of his gratitude for what that will
contained, and to en&s;ure its permanency,
he had offered his gratuitous &s;ervices to
the E&s;quire, for the protection of his
property; nor was this an incon&s;iderable
pre&s;ent, or an idle tender; for Bu&s;tle
was known never to retire with plea&s;ure
to re&s;t, unle&s;s the day had produced
&s;ome cau&s;e which might be brought on
at the next term. The co&s;tly price of
law we bewail in this country, as a great
grievance; indeed, it &s;eems only in the
reach of very rich men; but I have &s;ome|times
thought, that it is perhaps not an
evil of the magnitude it appears; for
&s;ince law is thus co&s;tly, all dread a &s;uit,
few are forward to commence one, and
&s;eize on any friendly accommodation.
If law were very cheap, there are many
noxious beings who would di&s;turb the
quiet of a neighbourhood by ince&s;&s;ant
<PB N="156" REF="179">
attacks, formed on pretences, which,
were they fal&s;e, would &s;till remain to be
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. I believe &s;ome men would
pa&s;s their days in court. The character
of Bu&s;tle has taught me the&s;e reflections.
As &s;oon as he had adju&s;ted matters with
his cou&s;in, to have all his law affairs&punc; ma|naged
gratuitou&s;ly, he had nothing more
to do than to indulge in the luxury of
di&s;covering occa&s;ions to employ the ut|mo&s;t
indu&s;try of his attorney. Directly
on his arrival on his e&s;tate, he walked
over his grounds, cautiou&s;ly attended by
his bailiff, who always accompanied him,
that he might be ready as a nece&s;&s;ary
witne&s;s in law. In his fir&s;t peregrination,
he returned home happy, for he was in a
rage.</P>
<P>One of our fields was only divided by
a &s;light quick&s;et hedge, from part of the
grounds of the E&s;quire; there was, in|deed,
a dry ditch &s;carce perceiveable, and
<PB N="157" REF="180">
in which grew a crab-apple tree, placed
in all appearance in our field. It &s;haded
and reclined over our ground, and, from
time immemorial, the property of the&s;e
crab-apples had been con&s;idered to ap|pertain
to the decea&s;ed old lady. One of
our &s;ervants was cutting a crab-&s;tick,
when E&s;quire Bu&s;tle pa&s;&s;ed. He &s;topt,
whi&s;pered the bailiff, and both imme|diately
mea&s;ured the hedge, and groped
in the ditch. Bu&s;tle at length turned to
the bailiff, de&s;ired him to li&s;ten, and re|mark
every thing that &s;hould happen,
without any interference. &startq;My lad,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;how dare you pillage that crab-tree?&endq;
The &s;ervant, who already knew
Bu&s;tle's character, was now well plea&s;ed
(as &s;uch per&s;ons are) in irritating the liti|gious
Lord of the Manor, and a&s;&s;erted
his ma&s;ter's right to the crab-apples. The
E&s;quire was &s;till employed in the ditch,
when, &s;uddenly &s;tarting, he exclaimed,
<PB N="158" REF="181">
&startq;Simple larceny, by G&mdash;! tran&s;porta|tion!
whipping!&endq; So &s;aying, he gravely
announced to the bailiff, that he was go|ing
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crab-tree,
which he began by plucking the fruit.
The &s;ervant oppo&s;ed, and retook the ap|ples
by violence. &startq;That's an action of
battery; mark bailiff!&endq; continued the
E&s;quire. &startq;Tell me, &s;irrah, have your
ma&s;ter and you ever taken conjointly,
and in the night, the&s;e crabs?&endq;&mdash;&startq;Yes,
&s;ure, as well as in the day&endq;&mdash;&startq;Compound
larceny! aiding and abetting by G&mdash;!
Acquaint your ma&s;ter, that he and you
have been both guilty of felonious taking
and carrying away the&s;e my crabs. I'll
have law, by the &s;tatute 6 of Geo. III. c.
36. The ca&s;e is a glorious ca&s;e; it con|tains
a dozen in one. Fir&s;t, the &s;ide of
this hedge is much damaged by that
fellow's clambering for crab-&s;ticks; &s;e|condly,
you are an aider and abettor by
<PB N="159" REF="182">
your own confe&s;&s;ion; thirdly, your ma&s;|ter
has been ob&s;erved taking the&s;e crabs,
which is &s;imple larceny; fourthly, you
have violently a&s;&s;aulted me, which
thievery and battery make compound
larceny; fifthly, you have not only taken
but carried away, and had they only been
carried to the end of the field, and left
there, it is a &s;ufficient <HI>a&s;portation</HI>&mdash;that's
the word. Tell your ma&s;ter I was born
in a land of law and freedom; law is the
privilege of a Briton; I can go to law
with the king. Hark ye! he may not
under&s;tand, unle&s;s you tell him that this
&s;ame crab-tree has got the be&s;t part of
<HI>it's roots</HI> in my ground; and, therefore,
nature has made it my property; and I
promi&s;e he and you &s;hall ta&s;te &s;omething
much &s;ourer than the afore&s;aid crabs;
&s;tatute 6 Geo. III.&endq;</P>
<P>When the &s;ervant returned, and report|ed
this affair, poor Wil&s;on, well knowing
<PB N="160" REF="183">
the di&s;po&s;itions of E&s;quire Bu&s;tle, im|mediately
&s;ent the following note, written
in great &s;implicity of heart, and without
a &s;u&s;picion of malice in the terms.</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Wil&s;on pre&s;ents his be&s;t re&s;pects
to Mr. Bu&s;tle, and very &s;incerely apolo|gi&s;es
for the ignorance of his &s;ervant.
He a&s;&s;ures him, that any number of the
crab-apples, and the crab-&s;ticks, &s;hall
be re&s;erved for his u&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>This note was ill adapted to &s;oothe the
irritated litigant, who vociferated for
law! He ob&s;erved, that this mode of com|promi&s;e
would be as dangerous as com|pounding
felony. I have to an&s;wer, &s;aid
he, to my po&s;terity for the&s;e crabs; and
they &s;hall not &s;uffer from my negligence.
Wil&s;on would compound merely for a life|term,
but this would not be binding on
his heirs, executors, and a&s;&s;igns. The
<PB N="161" REF="184">
crab-tree &s;hall be decided on by a Briti&s;h
jury. 'Tis a nice ca&s;e, a mo&s;t glorious
uncertainty! The roots are equally &s;pread
on both grounds, but being rather more
in mine, it becomes my <HI>natural</HI> property;
if I find the nece&s;&s;ary documents to prove
my grandfather, as I &s;u&s;pect to have been
the planter, it is mine by <HI>inheritance.</HI> And
then the battery, the larceny, the fe|lony;
for a crab, I affirm, is a fruit-tree.
He &s;ecretly exulted, that in pur&s;uing this
complex indictment from court to court,
the agreement of his cou&s;in, the attorney,
protected him from the ruin that even|tually
mu&s;t fall on his adver&s;ary, whether
he gained or lo&s;t his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Had the entire e&s;tate of the E&s;quire
depended on the property of this crab-tree,
his attentions could not have been more
indefatigable, nor his preparations more
formidable. I cannot, Sir, in&s;truct you
correctly re&s;pecting the whole legal proce&s;s.
<PB N="162" REF="185">
How it came at length into the higher
courts, I know not; but outrages were
de&s;cribed in &s;o &s;olemn and terrifying a
manner, that Mr. Wil&s;on appeared the
chief of a banditti, in&s;tead of the mo&s;t in|offen&s;ive
inhabitant of a little village;
while our &s;ervant was divided into as
many a&s;&s;ailants, as tho&s;e who increa&s;ed at
every fre&s;h recital of the fat knight. I
was informed, that in the court of chan|cery,
where it was contrived to carry this
&s;uit, it is nece&s;&s;ary to fill voluminous
&s;kins of parchment with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fic|tions,
and the mo&s;t unintelligible jargon.
Every new plea or petition, brought &s;ome
new exaggeration. Our ducks were
found in his ponds, a hor&s;e leaped over
his pailing, and he calculated, with pre|ci&s;ion,
the lo&s;s he had incurred by our
cattle brow&s;ing a hedge for &s;everal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
years. There was cau&s;e upon
cau&s;e, writs of error from the common
<PB N="163" REF="186">
law &s;ide, and what began in the court
of King's Bench, where we gained our
&s;uit, was, with a writ of error to rever&s;e
judgment, placed by the indu&s;trious in|genuity
of Bu&s;tle's cou&s;in, the attorney,
in that court of appeal, called the court
of Exchequer Chamber, where I think it
did not long re&s;t; but has lain for many
years in the court of Equity.</P>
<P>&startq;Meanwhile, all this was carried on at
an enormous expence on the &s;ide of poor
Wil&s;on. It was now his plea&s;ure, and
the only malice his gentle di&s;po&s;itions were
capable of fermenting to, when he ob|&s;erved
the lion and his jackal, the E&s;quire
and the bailiff, to &s;tand under this crab-tree,
and pluck the apples, while the &s;er|vant
would clamber to cut a crab-&s;tick,
which he flouri&s;hed in open defiance of
the E&s;quire; but all this innocent re|venge,
&s;erved only to &s;upply with new
matter the romantic incidents of that
<PB N="164" REF="187">
great noveli&s;t, the E&s;quire's cou&s;in and
lawyer. I recollect one good-natured
expre&s;&s;ion of Wil&s;on, that &s;ince this crab-tree
had produced a &s;uit in chancery, it
was more than probable, that he &s;hould
at lea&s;t enjoy it's &s;our produce during his
life.</P>
<P>The Law expences threatened to be
ruinous, and poor Wil&s;on's &s;pirits &s;unk
at every new bill of his lawyer. A ner|vous
fever took place. The apothecary of
our village was a warm advocate for Dr.
Buchan's &startq;Dome&s;tic Medicine,&endq; a work,
he a&s;&s;ured us, mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for all
families; but as the pre&s;criptions cannot
be correct, &s;ince that requires a per&s;onal
knowledge of the patient, he referred us
to him&s;elf for that portion of the medical
character. Wil&s;on devoutly applied to
this compilement of human maladies.
But from this &s;low fever on the &s;pirits,
occa&s;ioned by the long &s;uit in chancery,
<PB N="165" REF="188">
he never recovered, and to Dr. Buchan
he was indebted, for a catalogue of hu|man
di&s;ea&s;es of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite nature.
Sometimes he feared to die of a &s;uffoca|tion,
occa&s;ioned by a plethoric habit;
then of the &s;low and certain wheezings
of the a&s;thma; now of the commotions
of an indige&s;tion; he had now the yellow
jaundice, and now. Saint Anthony's fire.
He turned his apartment into a repo&s;itory
of medical apparatus. Fleecy ho&s;iery,
and blue flannel nine times faithfully
dyed; dumb bells and chamber hor&s;es;
fle&s;h bru&s;hes and &s;hower baths; nervous
draughts and fever powders; a &s;pecies of
morbid luxury pre&s;ented it&s;elf around,
and the unhappy patient &s;at with a ther|mometer
in his hand!</P>
<P>If I &s;eemed to think, Sir, that the exor|bitant
co&s;ts of the Law are &s;o far benefi|cial,
that they hinder many a di&s;putant to
re&s;ort incautiou&s;ly to it's tribunals, &s;o I
<PB N="166" REF="189">
equally lament, that the &s;hop of the apo|thecary
is not as extravagant as the court
of chancery. In one re&s;pect it bears a
re&s;emblance; in the length of time the
patient, in either ca&s;e, remains in the
hands of tho&s;e to whom he re&s;orted
for relief. We pay, in both in&s;tances,
for an immoderate number of neutral
draughts.</P>
<P>It was in this feeble and unnerved &s;tate,
that I u&s;ed to &s;it by poor Wil&s;on, while
he was adju&s;ting the &s;crolls of his attor|ney,
which looked like the volumes of
the ancients, which, when unrolled, extend
to an immen&s;e &s;pace. He never quitted
them but with a &s;igh, that expre&s;&s;ively
told the &s;tate of the heart from which it
&s;prung; it was like a hollow voice, that
breathed it's melancholy tones amid&s;t a
&s;cene of ruins. I turned my eyes from
the unoffending victim of law and phy&s;ic,
and when he caught a tear wandering on
<PB N="167" REF="190">
my cheek, I a&s;&s;ured him that it was not
&s;o much occa&s;ioned by the chancellor, as
by Dr. Buchan, who&s;e volume I had
rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, was more pernicious
than the writs of error i&s;&s;ued by E&s;quire
Bu&s;tle.</P>
<P>Law and phy&s;ic were not the only evils
this inoffen&s;ive man had to encounter;
divinity came to di&s;order the &s;eat of rea|&s;on.
Bu&s;tle had ejected (I think that is
the legal term) a certain Antinomian
preacher from his newly erected meeting,
for a nui&s;ance of neighbourhood; fir&s;t, as
a <HI>common nui&s;ance,</HI> for keeping a di&s;orderly
hou&s;e; to which, it &s;eems, his &s;aints had
converted his private dwelling-hou&s;e; and
&s;econdly, as <HI>a private nui&s;ance,</HI> becau&s;e
this meeting blinded an <HI>ancient window</HI>
of an ancient tenement of the E&s;quire's;
but, Sir, if the window had not been <HI>an|cient,</HI>
that is, if it had not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
there a long time without interruption,
<PB N="168" REF="191">
an action, our lawyer &s;aid, could not have
been laid<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone, vol. iii. p. 217.</NOTE> Such is the tenuity of legal
di&s;tinctions! But the wife of the An|tinomian
experienced from the <HI>law</HI> of
Bu&s;tle, the legal misfortunes peculiar to
our &s;ex. He indicted her fir&s;t, as an
eaves-dropper, for li&s;tening under walls
and windows; &s;econdly, as a common
&s;cold, or, as I recollect the term, <HI>communis
vixatrix;</HI> a law latin expre&s;&s;ion, which,
the attorney informed me, was confined
to the feminine gender<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. iv. p. 167.</NOTE>, and which,
permit me to ob&s;erve, is a glaring inju&s;|tice
to our &s;ex; for <HI>common &s;colds</HI> may,
I pre&s;ume, be found more frequently
among certain per&s;ons of the ma&s;culine
gender, and &s;uch characters as Bu&s;tle,
are a&s;&s;uredly a &s;pecies of this genus.</P>
<P>A common fate had introduced this
Antinomian into our hou&s;e, and the plea|&s;ure
<PB N="169" REF="192">
of venting our reciprocal &s;orrows
had made him more intimate than I
de&s;ired. It was not long before I per|ceived,
that the feeble and wounded in|tellect
of Wil&s;on was unre&s;i&s;tingly acce&s;|&s;ible
to the purpo&s;es of this fanatic. His
conver&s;ations afforded him an inten&s;e de|light,
and a continued peru&s;al of contro|ver&s;ial
points in theology ab&s;orbed his
attention from every dome&s;tic concern.
He pa&s;&s;ed laborious days, and &s;leeple&s;s
nights in explaining the con&s;ub&s;tantiality
of the Son with the Father; the di&s;tinction
between grace and ju&s;tification; and was
overjoyed to hear that Bu&s;tle avowedly
ridiculed the Athana&s;ian creed, for which
he was po&s;itive he would feel the eternity
of hell torments. I mu&s;t not now di&s;|gui&s;e
to you, that Mr. Wil&s;on lo&s;t all his
humanity, and while his head wandered&punc;
among the &s;peculative and incomprehen|&s;ible
points of theology, his heart nou|ri&s;hed
<PB N="170" REF="193">
an implacable hatred to, and a thir$t
of vengeance on all per&s;ons who differed
from his extravagant opinions. His lit|tle
charities were now confined to a few
wretched beings, who, in the daily viola|tion
of every moral duty, di&s;&s;erted by the
hour on the efficacy of grace, and the &s;al|vation
of faith. Wil&s;on, by a conver&s;ation
with the Antinomian, was at length made
to believe, that he was in a &s;tate of damna|tion;
becau&s;e of &s;ome controver&s;ial points,
which he unwarily owned he could not
believe, becau&s;e he could not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>&startq;What &s;hall I &s;hall do to &s;ave my pre|cious
&s;oul?&endq; enquired Wil&s;on. &startq;Defend
me, (&s;aid the man of grace) from the at|tacks
of the great Arian&endq;&mdash;E&s;quire Blu&s;|ter.
If the Antinomian had commanded
him to throw him&s;elf into the burning
$ava of Ve&s;uvius, he would not have he|&s;itated;
he, however, now only threw
him&s;elf once more into chancery. We
<PB N="171" REF="194">
&s;oon found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ell our little
e&s;tate, which was bought by our attor|ney.
Wil&s;on never recovered from the
terrible &s;tate in which religion had placed
his mind. He &s;at whole days in melan|choly
&s;ilence, occa&s;ionally ejaculating, &startq;ah
my precious &s;oul!&mdash;the Lamb!
&mdash;The gates of hell open, and lo! there
is gna&s;hing of teeth, wailing, and fires
that burn, but con&s;ume not.&endq; We at
length had &s;carcely money enough left
to convey my unhappy hu&s;band to Lon|don,
for the advice of Dr. Monro. He
expired &s;hortly afterwards, in a fever of
$$nacy and religion, execrating his &s;inful
exi&s;tence, and regarding my&s;elf and his
children with abhorrence. Alas, Sir! this
was more cruel to &s;uffer, than our preced|ing
misfortunes; the inoffen&s;ive and kind
Wil&s;on had been an indulgent hu&s;band.
and an affectionate parent. I was left in this
va&s;t metropolis unfriended and unknown. I
had now no relative on earth. I wanted even
<PB N="172" REF="195">
tho&s;e common friend&s;hips which might
afford me labour. I live on the wages of
pro&s;titution; but I live for my children!</P>
<P>It was thus, that <HI>law</HI> ruined the e&s;tate,
<HI>phy&s;ic</HI> the con&s;titution, and <HI>divinity</HI> the
under&s;tanding of the gentle&s;t and mo&s;t

Fa&s;hionable Sentiments on Friend|&s;hip,
Solitude, and Love.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Belfield had not viewed Charles
with indifference; a female of her
di&s;cernment does not live long with a
hand&s;ome young man without di&s;cover|ing
all his good qualities; and Charles
had that hone&s;t &s;implicity, which render|ed
him unaffectedly ignorant of any &s;in|gle
one he might po&s;&s;e&s;s. The <HI>mauvai&s;e
honte,</HI> &s;o much reprobated by the polite
part of the human &s;pecies, was never yet
repugnant to the &s;en&s;ations of the &s;ex.
We do not pre&s;ume to under&s;tand the
philo&s;ophy of the female mind; but
<PB N="174" REF="197">
po&s;&s;ibly a woman cheri&s;hes every hope,
when &s;he di&s;covers in a man a heart in
it's virgin &s;tate.</P>
<P>Lady Belfield now took a plea&s;ure in
gently &s;eparating the natural incru&s;tation
that covered the precious ore; experience
had given dexterity to her art; but there
is &s;ometimes a rough and immalleable
armour, by which nature protects her&s;elf
from the poli&s;hed in&s;truments of the
fini&s;hing arti&s;t. Charles, however, was
con&s;tantly invited to her parties, employ|ed
as her &s;ecretary, and con&s;ulted as an
arbiter, in the varied circle of her elegant
recreations. Charles was really very po|lite;
but then it was only the politene&s;s
of nature; a di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed,
and to communicate plea&s;ure; and with|out
being &s;en&s;ible of it, he was one of
the mo&s;t per&s;evering flatterers; he was
ever di&s;covering the faire&s;t &s;ides of every
character.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="198">
To Lady Belfield nature had been
liberal of tho&s;e felicitous di&s;po&s;itions
which &s;eize with ardour and facility
whatever is addre&s;&s;ed to the ta&s;te or the
imagination. Her talents had been as
much improved as the volatile routine
of a town life could admit. Her quick
&s;en&s;ibility acted like in&s;tinct; it preceded
the judgment, yet rarely differed from
it's &s;lower deci&s;ion. Her paintings ex|hibited
many carele&s;s inventive touches,
which, in the labours of an arti&s;t of ge|nius,
had been amplified, heightened,
and aided with all the potency of the
art; to &s;uch &s;he re&s;igned the glory,
while &s;he was &s;atisfied with the plea&s;ure.
Her mu&s;ic was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a rapid
and brilliant touch, but nice connoi&s;&s;eurs
affirmed, that &s;he often marred the cor|rectne&s;s
of the tune. Her voice &s;eemed
the modulation of her heart, but par|took
of all it's caprices; it gave a fugi|tive
<PB N="176" REF="199">
and incon&s;tant &s;weetne&s;s, which
&s;carcely charmed ere it was lo&s;t. Her
imagination would have been of the
higher order, but, confined to the com|mon
fictions of common writers &s;wallow|like,
it only &s;kimmed over the fluent
&s;urface of &s;entiment; and her repartee,
formed merely by the vapid dialogue of a
modern theatre, could never ri&s;e above
that tenuity of wit, which, in it's mo&s;t
&s;olid &s;tate, is but an ea&s;y &s;prightline&s;s.</P>
<P>It was the misfortune of this lady, that
in the pre&s;ent day, to excel in tho&s;e ac|compli&s;hments
which dignify or adorn,
or to re&s;pect the decencies of the do|me&s;tic
character, are not con&s;idered as
fa&s;hionable acqui&s;itions. It is very cer|tain,
that in the higher circles of &s;ociety,
a league has been formed by all the
dunces of either &s;ex, to ridicule or to de|plore
the talents of their more ingenious
acquaintances. Shall a per&s;on of fa&s;hion
<PB N="177" REF="200">
(they &s;ay) excel in mu&s;ic, which is only
the profe&s;&s;ion of a compo&s;er; or in poe|try,
with which the &s;hops are far from
being unprovided; or in painting, when
employed or unemployed arti&s;ts have
their re&s;pective prices? The dignity of
rank, they are &s;o fearful to violate by
efforts of this kind, is a prejudice of con|&s;iderable
injury to their per&s;onal charac|ter;
what they may want in the &s;timulus
which poverty or dependance affords to
men of genius, is amply compen&s;ated
by their lei&s;ure and their ta&s;te. The&s;e re|&s;ources
are clo&s;ing rapidly on the fa&s;hiona|ble
circles; and it may be progno&s;ticated,
that the mo&s;t elevated in rank in this
country will be the mo&s;t barbarous, the
mo&s;t unintelligent, and the mo&s;t in&s;igni|ficant
of the nation. A fal&s;e refinement
and a gothic barbarity differ in their ap|pearance,
$ot in their reality.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="201">
Nature in Lady Belfield was, however,
&s;omething &s;tronger than fa&s;hion. She
excelled her companions, but &s;he blu&s;hed
at her excellence. To conceal any di&s;|tingui&s;hing
talent of our own is the great
requi&s;ite of politene&s;s; &s;o that tho&s;e who
have no talents at all, have the faire&s;t
chance to be deemed the mo&s;t polite.
Profe&s;&s;ional men, who feel an ambition to
mix with the mo&s;t poli&s;hed circle, fir&s;t
dive&s;t them&s;elves of the curious know|ledge
their laborious life has collected,
and when once they are reduced to
idioti&s;m, are then the humble com|panions
for idiots; for let men of talents
do whatever they can, an idiot will ever
excel them in his own natural faculty.</P>
<P>This lady mo&s;t $edulou&s;ly &s;tudied to
have no character at all; but Nature main|tained
her rights, for to a &s;en&s;itive heart
&s;he had given an ear and an eye, which
refu&s;ed the con&s;traints their owner put
<PB N="179" REF="202">
on them. She e&s;&s;ayed with great inge|nuity
to annihilate her faculties; but in|voluntarily
&s;he ro&s;e from the dead flat|ne&s;s
of fa&s;hionable uniformity. Some
unlucky circum&s;tance ever happened
that provoked her &s;en&s;ibility; &s;ome fea|ture
of nature to &s;eize, &s;ome harmony to
combine, &s;ome effort of ta&s;te to relieve
the activity of her rapid &s;en&s;ations. In
vain &s;he whirled round the vortex of
frivolity, in vain &s;he indulged a laxity of
morals; nature kept firm hold of her
heart, and it co&s;t her more pains to be
capricious and di&s;&s;olute, than to have
been &s;en&s;ible and virtuous.</P>
<P>One morning Charles was attending
her Lady&s;hip in the painting room. The
&s;ubject that was then placed on her ea&s;el
was an hi&s;torical piece of Damon and Py|thias.
At a great di&s;tance was Damon &s;een
plunging his &s;purs in his hor&s;e, throwing
his body impatiently forwards, while his
<PB N="180" REF="203">
eye &s;eemed already to have reached the
&s;caffold. &startq;This &s;ame Damon (&s;aid her
Lady&s;hip) occa&s;ions me as much anxiety
as if I were Pythias. Don't you think
that &s;hade is too &s;trong, while the hor&s;e is

quite near the &s;caffold, while his hor&s;e is
at an immen&s;e di&s;tance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your Lady&s;hip (replied Charles) is
the &s;evere&s;t critic on your own paintings.
Permit me to admire the ge&s;ture and
animation of that figure of Damon. It
is eloquent to the eye; it &s;eems to &s;ay, a
minute is fatal! That per&s;on, placed at
the mo&s;t di&s;tant part of the crowd, ap|pears
to communicate his intelligence to
tho&s;e who are near, while your Lady&s;hip
has given an evidence of fine ta&s;te, in
breaking tho&s;e ma&s;&s;es, and di&s;tributing the
light among the body of the people, who
&s;eem in a &s;udden tumult, as if they were
catching a report, which has not yet
<PB N="181" REF="204">
reached the &s;pectators who &s;urround Py|thias
and the tyrant. That intere&s;ting
&s;ubject, that delightful &s;tory of my pue|rile
days, I cannot &s;ee without it's re|minding
me with a &s;igh of the friend&s;hips
of this age!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear little fool, you always re|mind
me of E&s;op's Fables; I &s;uppo&s;e you
can never look at a dog or a cat, but
you mu&s;t end with &s;ome &s;tupid moral,
and &s;ome intolerable reflection. What is
this &s;tory of Damon and Pythias, but
one gentleman giving bail for another?
and what man of honour would now run
away from his bail? 'Tis a mo&s;t pedantic
ob&s;ervation you have thrown out on
friend&s;hip. I am &s;ure there is no diffi|culty
in finding friends; one is really
pe&s;tered with them. So many morning
calls is a hard tax to pay for the ac|quaintance
of per&s;ons who&s;e names are
better known than their faces. A lady
<PB N="182" REF="205">
of fa&s;hion has ju&s;t written an e&s;&s;ay on
&startq;The Triumph of Acquaintance over
Friend&s;hip.&endq; She has &s;aved her reputation
by not prefixing her name; for <HI>entre
nous &s;oit dit,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t be a mo&s;t &s;tupid
being to have fatigued her&s;elf with writ|ing,
I a&s;&s;ure you, near a hundred pages.
However, &s;ince the thing is done, I would
advi&s;e you to bind it with your Che&s;ter|field.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Will your Lady&s;hip pardon me if I
confe&s;s, that I can never prefer the intere&s;ts
(&s;ince every action of our life is &s;aid to be
governed by this principle) derived from
an univer&s;al acquaintance, to tho&s;e which
ari&s;e from an individual &s;ympathy. I
prefer the latter, as I would prefer the
ea&s;e and &s;eclu&s;ion of a little cottage of
my own to the liberty of re&s;iding at St.
James's, where I might command all, by
being commanded by all.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="206">
&startq;I have told you, Charles, that &s;imilies
take too much time to under&s;tand, par|ticularly
when they are quite unlike the
thing they are compared to. One idea
at a time if you plea&s;e; that is fatigue
enough. When &s;hall I &s;ee you &s;o accom|pli&s;hed,
as to conver&s;e without any ideas
at all? Your cottage reminds me of that
picture. Reach it. Ther, is a &s;cene of
retirement! I &s;hall darken this grove,
roughen the&s;e rocks, and put my two
lovers a little more in the &s;hade, which is
quite nece&s;&s;ary; for it is by concealing,
that we exhibit objects to the imagina|tion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your Lady&s;hip, I &s;ee, cannot help con|ver&s;ing
without ideas. It is indeed a ro|mantic
&s;olitude; what a calm tranquillity
to the fancy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Again; what &s;olitude a tranquil|lity!
It is a torment. You rural phi|lo&s;ophers
never read fairy tales written
<PB N="184" REF="207">
by a French Counte&s;s, who had a great
deal of wit, when wit was in fa&s;hion.
I mu&s;t tell you one of her pretty inven|tions,
called the Palace of Vengeance.
You doubtle&s;s imagine from the title,
that it is &s;ome
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;Relentle&s;s power,</L>
<L>Who&s;e iron &s;courge and torturing pow'r&endq;</L></Q>
are felt in the terrific abode of the furies.
My dear fool, it is a vernal paradi&s;e, the
eglantine bowers of the Graces, the ro&s;e
and myrtle beds of enchanting loves. The
pre&s;iding genius, jealous of the happine&s;s
of two lovers, places them in this magical
&s;pot. They enter with the feathered feet
of rapture. O amiable &s;olitude, delici|ous
&s;ilence, and friendly &s;hade!&mdash;The
genius was certainly a man of the town,
one experienced in the promenade of
Bond-&s;treet. His project could not fail.
The eternal iteration of the &s;ame atten|tions
<PB N="185" REF="208">
and the &s;ame ideas communicated
a langour to their raptures, a bluntne&s;s to
the fine point of enjoyment. In a word,
our two lovers fini&s;hed by a frank and
reciprocal confe&s;&s;ion, that they had long
viewed each other, fir&s;t with indifference,
and now with con&s;iderable pain. A Pa|radi&s;e
was the Palace of Vengeance! So
much for &s;olitude! I am as much ter|rified
at the &s;ight of a tree as I &s;hould
be to &s;ee a dead man. The plea&s;ures of
&s;olitude entirely con&s;i&s;t in &s;leeping with|out
being di&s;turbed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And yet your Lady&s;hip has painted
land&s;cape with a ta&s;te, and &s;election of
objects, that demon&s;trate the plea&s;ure
you mu&s;t have taken in tracing the fine&s;t
a&s;pects of nature.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have, Charles, given more attention
to the&s;e trifles than becomes me. 'Tis
my folly; I never can pa&s;s my ea&s;el with|out
a touch; I will paint no more, for I
paint too well; it &s;eems with me more
<PB N="186" REF="209">
a &s;tudy than an amu&s;ement. What do
you think of the&s;e hi&s;torical pieces?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That Lucretia charms me. Brutus
rai&s;es the dagger to the gods, and &s;eems
to view on it's en&s;anguined point the &s;al|vation
and the vengeance of Rome.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pooh! I will throw that Lucretia out
of my collection. It is a libel on the &s;ex.
Be&s;ides, I am told not a word of it is true.
But look, my dear boy, (continued Lady
Belfield, ri&s;ing) at that portrait of the
lovely Scotti&s;h queen, and that Cleopatra,
who yet glowing from the embraces of
Anthony, exhibits all the luxuriou&s;ne&s;s of
her per&s;on, the artifice of her dre&s;s, the
inebriation of that &s;tudied &s;cene, where
&s;he throws her&s;elf before the in&s;en&s;ible
Augu&s;tus. There is a &s;imilarity in the
fate of the&s;e unfortunate women. Cleo|patra
was betrothed to Pompey, enjoyed
Cae&s;ar, yet only triumphed in her An|thony.
Mary, betrothed to Francis, en|joyed
<PB N="187" REF="210">
Darnley, yet only triumphed in her
Bothwell. The&s;e are the ornaments of
our &s;ex, models of voluptuous freedom
without vulgar licentiou&s;ne&s;s; pa&s;&s;ion
without rage, enjoyment without &s;atiety.
They &s;hook all the ro&s;es of love without
dropping the fre&s;he&s;t dews. Their plea|&s;ures
were tho&s;e of ver&s;atile de&s;ire.&endq;</P>
<P>Now it is needful to inform the reader,
that &s;ince her Lady&s;hip had ri&s;en from
her &s;eat, and while &s;he was occupied in
di&s;&s;erting on Mary and on Cleopatra, &s;he
rolled on Charles two orbs of beauty &s;o
lively and tender, that neither tho&s;e of
Mary nor Cleopatra could have told more
intelligently the &s;ecrets of a bo&s;om that
had gradually quitted it's gauze.</P>
<P>But Charles knew nothing of all this.
He was looking at the picture. Her
Lady&s;hip was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of
leaning her arm upon his &s;houlder; her
mouth was approaching his cheek. The
<PB N="188" REF="211">
&s;en&s;ation of a white and firm arm awaken|ed
Charles; her attitude embarra&s;&s;ed;
his eye caught the inclination of her lips;
a fine &s;uffu&s;ion mantled his animated
face. How long it takes to write what
&s;carce employed a &s;ingle moment!</P>
<P>With the half-glance, by which he had
caught her Lady&s;hip's attitude, a gentle
tremor thrilled in his heart; he was &s;ur|pri&s;ed;
he was timorous; he was indeed
virtuous; he did not, therefore, incline his
cheek to her, nor &s;uddenly left her Lady&s;hip
un&s;upported; he only turned his face away,
which an&s;wered preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing
as if he had boldly turned his face to
her; for his blooming cheek came in
contact with the warm mouth of Lady
Belfield; &s;he impre&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t criminal
ki&s;s on a guiltle&s;s and blu&s;hing cheek.&mdash;&startq;You
fool, (&s;he &s;aid) I have been talking
an hour in vain!&endq;</P>
<P>As her Lady&s;hip was &s;peaking, Lord
Belfield entered, and ob&s;erving her
<PB N="189" REF="212">
Lady&s;hip adju&s;ting her neck-kerchief, and
Charles &s;ilent and confu&s;ed, apologi&s;ed
for his &s;udden entrance. &startq;My Lord,
(replied Lady Belfield, with perfect com|po&s;ure),
our philo&s;opher has an inveterate
ru&s;ticity. I have attacked him covert|ly,
at a di&s;tance, by in&s;inuation, by
per&s;ua&s;ion, and I at length was obliged
to make an open a&s;&s;ault. The boy
blu&s;hes, but were it not for this blu&s;h I
&s;hould think he had no more &s;en&s;ation
than the great Apollo in the hall.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your Lady&s;hip, (his Lord&s;hip replied)
does him infinite honour; but a rougher
human colt never received a town &s;naffle.
He is no cuckow; he will lay no eggs in
the ne&s;ts of others. I offered to intro|duce
him to the nymph of the Seine, and
acquainted him with your Lady&s;hip's
wager with the Marchione&s;s; but he
looked and talked as &s;ermonically as
Kenyon. By the bye, poor Sir Francis is
<PB N="190" REF="213">
obliged to pay ten thou&s;and pounds for
meeting Lady Betty at the Star and
Garter. That Kenyon has a mill-&s;tone
for his heart; he is as cold, yet as fiery,
as a flint from his own &s;hire, and as of|fen&s;ive
to &s;ociety as the &s;mell of one of his
own overgrown leeks. Will your Lady|&s;hip
credit, that he threatens <HI>us,</HI> if indict|ed
on the gaming act, with his pillory?
What a vulgar fellow! There is the
Counte&s;s of Cog and Mrs. Arch in the
greate&s;t con&s;ternation; they are as black
and as red as their own tables of rouge et
noir. But this Welch judge always puts
one out of one's way. I came to an|nounce
to your Lady&s;hip, that I mu&s;t
have the honour of introducing Mon&s;ieur
Vaurien; the gentleman recommended
to me by the late Duke De Liancourt,
who has &s;uddenly di&s;appeared, and his
friends have not the &s;atisfaction of know|ing
whether he has been guillotined, or
<PB N="191" REF="214">
only ma&s;&s;acred. Vaurien has been with
me this morning. Ah! the accompli&s;h|ed
man! When he has learnt the Engli&s;h
language, Charles, he will become your
rival and your model. I recommend him
&s;trongly to your attentions. Take the
impre&s;&s;ion of his poli&s;h and his figure;
&s;tick to him then like warm &s;ealing-wax.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Di&s;&s;ertation on the Marvellous in Novel
Writing. Mon&s;ieur Vaurien's fir&s;t Ap|pearance
on this Stage.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mon&s;ieur Vaurien is a character of
the fir&s;t importance in this our
veritable hi&s;tory, and as we are &s;olicitous
of affording our readers the &s;elf-flattering
plea&s;ure of di&s;covering the character in
the events, we are inclined to re&s;i&s;t our
own gratification, in this opportunity of
attempting to adorn our narrative with the
pointed &s;entences of a Tacitus, and the
embelli&s;hed periods of a Sallu&s;t.</P>
<P>Dome&s;tic hi&s;torians, like our&s;elves, of
late have duped their readers with the
MARVELLOUS. The bulk of readers,
<PB N="193" REF="216">
the only kind to which we moderns de|vote
our lucubrations, &s;eem now much
more plea&s;ed to be frightened out of their
wits, than to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making a pro|per
u&s;e of them. It is much ea&s;ier to
excite our wonder, than to &s;atisfy our
judgment. Skeletons &s;lowly pacing, ra|pidly
cour&s;ing, or quietly coffined, are
not of difficult invention. We cannot
e&s;teem works, which employing human
characters, exhibit not even a &s;ide-glance
at poor for&s;aken nature; de&s;cribe emo|tions
which as none have felt, none can
decide on their propriety; and he who
writes of gho&s;ts, &s;hould write to gho&s;ts,
but he who writes of man, addre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf
to his fellow citizens. Hi&s;tories of
man, if ill written, are unde&s;ervedly called
<HI>novels,</HI> and well written, are unju&s;tly
termed <HI>fictions.</HI></P>
<P>But if it is agreed, that to intermix
&s;uch ob&s;olete &s;cenery with exi&s;ting man|ners,
<PB N="194" REF="217">
is no dereliction of an author's ta&s;te,
and no impudent in&s;ult on a reader's
judgment, we mo&s;t humbly offer, a pro|ject
for the new machinery of a modern
novel. A certain foreign writer, not
quite unknown for the length of his pro|bo&s;cis,
and no &s;mall &s;avourite of the
ladies of his day, did publi&s;h a collection
of the marvellous, in a very entertaining
and diver&s;ified romance, entitled The
Metamorpho&s;is. We, therefore, mode&s;tly
&s;ubmit whether it would evince inferior
invention, or more violate the truth of
nature, than &s;ome fa&s;hionable volumes
avowedly do, if we were to introduce
the thievi&s;h Mercury among the com|mon
council; Apollo, as the &s;canda|lous
paragrapher of a morning paper;
and alarm a crippled, &s;enile, &s;warthy
nabob for the purity of his Venus, by the
appearance of Mars in Bond-&s;treet. Are
<PB N="195" REF="218">
not the gods and godde&s;&s;es as intere&s;ting
as tho&s;e &s;talking per&s;onages, who have
only made a &s;hort excur&s;ion from Sur|geon's-hall?
The de&s;criptive views before
the denouement are &s;ufficiently fanciful,
yet the &s;udden tremors, with which &s;ome
pale and amiable young ladies are affected,
are not only un&s;ufferably di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, but
always remind us of &startq;The Magical Mir|ror,&endq;
exhibited not long ago, in this
place of exhibition, London; where,
after viewing the charming delu&s;ion of
grapes &s;welling into a blooming ma|turity,
or faces angelically &s;miling, &s;ud|denly
there appeared a mo&s;t hideous
&s;keleton's &s;cull, di&s;tending it's terrific
jaws. This denouement, like that of the
Grecian tragic bard's, did occa&s;ion a few
mi&s;carriages; but <HI>this exhibitor</HI> of <HI>&s;keletons
heads,</HI> after having been <HI>properly</HI> per&s;uad|ed
of it's great impropriety, withdrew his
<PB N="196" REF="219">
gorgonic finale. He &s;upplied it by the
figure of a <HI>bird,</HI> which formed but an un|affecting
clo&s;e. We mu&s;t neither be ex|travagant
nor in&s;ipid. We mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ively
offer this hint to certain exhibi|tors
of &s;keletons in print.</P>
<P>Of our miraculous writers, there have
been a few, who have &s;o far felt a re|verence
for venerable nature, as mode&s;tly
to explain preternatural appearances, by
natural cau&s;es; and a&s;&s;uredly their inge|nuity
de&s;erves commendation, while their
torture excites compa&s;&s;ion. But tales,
con&s;tructed even with this curious po&s;&s;i|bility,
are read like epigrams; merely to
&s;ee how they will end; and like epigrams,
the &s;urpri&s;e they are &s;o &s;olicitous to rai&s;e,
can be rai&s;ed no more. We return in
vain to &s;uch productions, for tho&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ive
truths, which germinate in the
heart, while fancy can only &s;catter pe|ri&s;hable
<PB N="197" REF="220">
blo&s;&s;oms. Nothing is &s;o beau|tiful
as truth, yet, what is extraordinary,
nothing is &s;o durable.</P>
<P>From Germany, has been imported
this groto&s;que ta&s;te; heavy Germany!
The gentlemen of the diplomatic corps,
have laboured to reach that degree in the
&s;cale of ta&s;te, which <HI>we have pa&s;&s;ed;</HI> and
we doubt whether there is more of civi|lity
or barbari&s;m, by a retrograde motion,
to bring our&s;elves down to them. We
have &s;ome poor Engli&s;h &s;tudents, who
are devoutly applying, with all their gut|tural
faculty, to heighten our amenity,
by redundant German con&s;onants, and to
brighten our wit, by clum&s;y German
graces. We mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in preferring,
even to Wicland's &startq;numerous pro&s;e,&endq;
and Haller's and Klop&s;tock's ver&s;e &startq;dragging
it's &s;low length,&endq; their pandects and
their dige&s;ts; but more particularly a
certain manual performance, gloriou&s;ly
<PB N="198" REF="221">
entitled, &startq;The Theatre of Europe,&endq;
which containing the hi&s;tory of twenty
years, has only yet reached to thirty-five
volumes in folio. We write thirty-five
in words, as Robert&s;on does his dates, to
prevent errors. A profound German ex|claims,
with a national exultation, that he
finds every thing in the&s;e works&mdash;every
thing, we imagine, but ta&s;te to &s;elect, and
penetration to comprehend.</P>
<P>Should it therefore happen that all
gho&s;ts are exorci&s;ed from our future hi&s;|tories
of man, which may be the ca&s;e
before the clo&s;e of <HI>this</HI> century, we con|&s;ole
our noble brethren with an a&s;&s;urance
that there will remain enough of THE
MARVELLOUS in NATURE, provided
that they will only convert to it's proper
u&s;e, the EYE, which in our opinion to a
real noveli&s;t, a mere collector of human
facts, is worth that magic wand, or any
other &s;pecies of necromantic art, which
<PB N="199" REF="222">

if he refu&s;es to
<Q>&startq;EYE NATURE'S WALKS,&endq;</Q>

<L>NAT. LEE.</L></Q></P>
<P>But &s;hall not <HI>we</HI> in our turn be cen|&s;ured?
our windows we acknowledge are
but made of gla&s;s, and may be demoli&s;h|ed
by the pebbles thrown by raw boys,
<PB N="200" REF="223">
as well as by the cannonading of graver
critics. We would exhibit a <HI>ve$i&s;imili|tude</HI>
of nature, yet do we not conceive
that this is incompatible with the <HI>marvel|lous.</HI>
A judicial critic, a &s;olemn judge
of his own private election, who has never
been &s;eated at the cabinet councils of
nature, will regard &s;ome of our truths, as
fictions. He will not ea&s;ily comprehend
that nature &s;ometimes twi&s;ts pretty
&s;trongly the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite &s;ingularities;
mo&s;t chymically amalgamates her rare&s;t
metals; and combines tho&s;e varieties in
one character, which generally &s;he finds
quite &s;ufficient to form many ordinary
per&s;onages. We &s;ay this as an apology
for the characters of Vaurien, and the
Platoni&s;t, who hereafter will appear. And
now, for the ea&s;e of our&s;elf, and that bet|ter
half of our&s;elf, the candid reader, we
here clo&s;e our di&s;&s;ertation on the mar|vellous
in novel writing.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="224">
We return to Mon&s;ieur Vaurien, who
being <HI>un homme infiniment aimable,</HI> will
not at all be offended, by this &s;light neg|lect.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object that intere&s;ted the
hou&s;e of Belfield, in the character of
this gentleman, and which is too com|monly
indeed the fir&s;t noticed in a
&s;tranger, was his per&s;onal appearance.
Perhaps men &s;hould not be judged, like
coin, by their look, and their &s;ounds.
Nature, in her fine&s;t hand-writing, on
the whole figure of Vaurien, had &s;aid,
&startq;this is an extraordinary man;&endq; but
&s;he went no further; and the &s;pecies of
the extraordinary, was unfortunately left
to be di&s;covered by the practical expe|rience
of his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Vaurien was ju&s;t above mediocrity in
&s;ize; &s;o that it co&s;t him little exertion to
a&s;&s;ume an air of maje&s;ty, when a bold
and dignified ge&s;ture was requi&s;ite. The
<PB N="202" REF="225">
fine&s;t colours with which nature ever
tinted the human face, glowed on his
countenance; his eyes were of the darke&s;t
lu&s;tre, a liquid fire &s;parkled in tho&s;e
re&s;tle&s;s orbs; their ma&s;culine &s;pirit re|lieved
the delicacy of his complexion;
and without the expre&s;&s;ion they gave
to his face, it would have had little more
than the mo&s;t feminine &s;oftne&s;s. When
nature produced Vaurien &s;he &s;eemed in|clined
to have created a woman; but
Vaurien, with the peculiar &s;en&s;ibility
of the &s;ex, had made him&s;elf &s;omething
more than man. His voice had a cir|cumference
of &s;ound, which included
every note of the human pa&s;&s;ions; awe|ful
in it's loud eloquence, a&s;&s;ua&s;ive and
touching in it's modulated &s;weetne&s;s, and
enchanting even in the murmur of a
whi&s;per. His whole frame was vivified
by the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive ge&s;ture; it was
an embodied voice; eloquent in words,
<PB N="203" REF="226">
he was &s;till more per&s;ua&s;ive in action.
Fa&s;cination was an art in Vaurien; when
he threw him&s;elf at the knees of an of|fended
beauty, her re&s;entment died away,
&s;he felt in&s;tantly what &s;he never felt be|fore,
and to li&s;ten to Vaurien was to &s;e|cure
her own &s;eduction. If an adver&s;ary
accu&s;ed, his mind became confu&s;ed, his
voice failed; the fixed eye, the &s;tarting
ge&s;ture of Vaurien, darted contending
pa&s;&s;ions in his agitated &s;pirits. Was he
engaged in the cau&s;e of a friend? he
in&s;pired confidence, de&s;cribed difficulties,
and taught how to vanqui&s;h them; he
bound the exi&s;tence of his friend with his
own, and whenever it &s;eemed that he
knew too much, it was found that the
fate of his friend could alone depend on
the will of Vaurien.</P>
<P>His genius was probably equal to the
greate&s;t occa&s;ions; he, at lea&s;t, had al|ways
&s;ound it &s;uperior to whatever he
<PB N="204" REF="227">
had hitherto directed it. He joined to
a calm and per&s;evering indu&s;try, an ar|dent
and hazardous te$erity; we mu&s;t
ri&s;que a throw in the game of human
life, he would &s;ay. His pa&s;&s;ions were
impetuous when let loo&s;e, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
when checked. He was judicious and
inventive; temperate and voluptuous;
avaricious and lavi&s;h. In his boundle&s;s
&s;oul was contained each extreme of pa&s;|&s;ion;
flexible or firm, it felt not the in|fluence
of human events; never &s;o mi&s;er|able,
as to be hopele&s;s of enjoyment,
never &s;o humiliated, as to be forgetful
of glory. But his imagination, by hav|ing
greater magnitude than that of
other men, confounded it&s;elf like a
whale in &s;hallow water; men indeed were
in&s;truments in his hand, but for &s;ome
va&s;t and romantic projects, they were
in&s;truments too uncertain and too feeble.
Like Archimedes, he thought that had he
<PB N="205" REF="228">
fit machines, he wanted not the &s;kill, to
move the earth at his plea&s;ure. His
projects were too romantic to be at|tempted,
and too &s;ingular to be cre|dited.
Vaurien, had been a traveller who
had experienced all the benevolence and
all the malice of his fellow men; the
confident of dukes in their palaces, and
of pea&s;ants in their cottages; one who
had &s;tudied in &s;olitude, and acted in life;
who had rioted in plea&s;ure, and felt no
&s;ufferings in it's ab&s;tinence; a vicious
and great man, capable even of virtue.</P>
<P>Such was the per&s;on, who now pre|&s;ented
him&s;elf before Lord and Lady
Belfield, with a mode&s;ty that embelli&s;hed
the winning addre&s;s of his voice and his
manners. His re&s;i&s;tle&s;s grace &s;carcely
&s;een, was felt; he gained their admira|tion,
and, were the &s;en&s;ation not too
&s;trong for &s;uch noble per&s;onages, would
have gained their affections.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="229">
His conver&s;ation was delightful, by the
variegation of it's topics, the vivacity of
his remarks, and it's information copious
and novel. He could only conver&s;e in his
vernacular idiom; and apologized for his
unpardonable ignorance of the language
of a country he admired and venerated.
But he a&s;&s;uredly lo&s;t nothing by con|ver&s;ing
in the brilliant idiom of his ma|ternal
tongue; a language which in it's
mo&s;t familiar phra&s;es and colloquial dic|tion,
di&s;plays that delicacy of expre&s;&s;ion,
that vivacity of ideas, that epigrammatic
point, which would furni&s;h our pre&s;ent
race of dramati&s;ts, with more wit than
they can afford to be&s;tow on their indul|gent
audiences, &s;uppo&s;ing that wit would
&s;erve their turn as well as pantomime.</P>
<P>He de&s;cribed many intere&s;ting events
of the French revolution; but the&s;e he
only de&s;cribed, and did not comment on,
otherwi&s;e than while li&s;tening with per|&s;everance
<PB N="207" REF="230">
to the volubility of Lord Bel|field,
he &s;ometimes re&s;ponded with a
piteous &s;hrug, an a&s;&s;enting inclination of
the head, and a pathetic elevation of the
eyes and the hands. My Lord having
poured out <HI>all</HI> his ideas, was as clearly
&s;een through, as an empty decanter.</P>
<P>His pre&s;ent &s;ituation was enquired. He
informed them that it was well adapted
to cheri&s;h that plea&s;ing melancholy which
an exile feels, when he only &s;uffers for
unavailing efforts employed for the good
of his expellers. &startq;It would be criminal
in me to enjoy any repo&s;e, when my un|happy
country bleeds through all it's
veins. No, my Lord, when I dip my
bread in water, the purity of my heart,
renders it a voluptuous meal. I am an
exile, but I am &s;till a patriot. And
when the ju&s;t Ari&s;tides, even in&s;cribed
the &s;hell that condemned him, &s;hall I
lament, that my intentions are ill under|&s;tood
<PB N="208" REF="231">
by my fellow citizens? Solitude,
my Lord, is not terrible; there I find
the wants of nature are &s;o few, that I
often am &s;urpri&s;ed, a thinking being
&s;hould complain of poverty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is exactly (cried my Lord)
what the great philo&s;opher Subtile has
&s;o often &s;aid. And I dare &s;ay it is true;
but it is &s;urpri&s;ing that if the wants of
nature are &s;o few, philo&s;ophers &s;hould
talk of the ju&s;tice of a public divi&s;ion of
the lands, an Agrarian law.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my Lord (replied Vaurien) de|&s;igning
men too often a&s;&s;ume the glo|rious
di&s;tinction, of preceptors of the hu|man
race. A philo&s;opher &s;hould only
coun&s;el how to employ wealth, but he
cea&s;es to be &s;uch, if he acquires it. Phi|lo&s;ophy
has it's counterfeit coin, my Lord,
that bears the impre&s;&s;ion, but is not
&s;terling. Some of my own countrymen,
who have taken refuge in this courteous
<PB N="209" REF="232">
and bountiful i&s;land, I have &s;een, and do
not like. I keep my&s;elf in the utmo&s;t
&s;eclu&s;ion. Exile &s;hall not convert a pa|triot
into an intriguer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e are noble &s;entiments Mr. Vau|rien,
replied his Lord&s;hip. If you will do me
the honour of occupying an apartment in
my hou&s;e, your re&s;idence in this country,
may be &s;oftened by the attentions I
would pay to your merits. Charles, my
young friend here, will be proud of any
little &s;ervices he can render, and your &s;o|ciety
will in&s;truct a youth inexperienced
in men and manners.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;hall not repeat, for the reader's con|venience
and my own, the infinite obliga|tions,
and the great number of objections,
by which the ingenuity of Vaurien oppo&s;|ed
the invitation of Lord Belfield. In|deed
his Lord&s;hip totally failed in his
de&s;ire of having Mon&s;ieur Vaurien for
his companion. Nothing could prevail
<PB N="210" REF="233">
over the mode&s;ty of the inflexible French|man.</P>
<P>Lady Belfield interpo&s;ed; &s;he de&s;cribed
all the conveniencies &s;he thought might
recommend them&s;elves, and &s;he lamented
the plea&s;ure he denied them from his
conver&s;ation. All in vain! &startq;&s;a Lady&s;hip,
etoit trop flatteu&s;e&endq;&mdash;She fixed her eyes
on Vaurien, a &s;pontaneous glance ex|pre&s;&s;ed
&s;omething more intere&s;ting than a
verbal invitation.&mdash;&startq;<HI>Ah, mon Dieu! Je
&s;uis accabl&eacute; de vos bont&eacute;s; Je &s;uis au comble

<P>In plain Engli&s;h, and without a meta|phor,
Mon&s;ieur Vaurien found him&s;elf
mo&s;t conveniently accommodated at the
hou&s;e of Lord Belfield, enjoying tran|quilly,
<HI>des diners magnifiques, et des &s;oupers
divins,</HI> preci&s;ely ju&s;t as if he were at Paris.
Meanwhile, hone&s;t Charles was quite re|joiced
at the &s;ociable qualities of Mon|&s;ieur
<PB N="211" REF="234">
Vaurien, and was &startq;right glad&endq; to

was rendered voluptuous by the purity

<P>NEITHER dazzled by the &s;plendour,
nor enervated by the enjoyments of
which he participated in the hou&s;e of
Lord Belfield, the plea&s;urable days of
Vaurien were not inactive; he &s;natched
at tho&s;e intervals of time which many
con&s;ume in li&s;tless regrets of a wearied
exi&s;tence, and from midnight orgies,
often e&s;caped to &s;tudious vigils. His
pre&s;ent object was the acqui&s;ition of the
Engli&s;h language; he knew that every
proce&s;s of indu&s;try can be calculated
with preci&s;ion, and that the learning of
languages, of which the knowledge in|&s;lates
the vanity of &s;o many idlers in eru|dition,
<PB N="213" REF="236">
was after all only the gro&s;s amount
of &s;o many days patient labour. &startq;As
for the dead languages (he &s;aid) they are
not of indi&s;pen&s;ible utility in the pre&s;ent
&s;tate of the literature of modern Europe;
we have models of every &s;pecies of com|po&s;ition;
I feel no ambition to re-write
in Greek or in Latin, what is inimitable
in my maternal language; I would not
wre&s;tle with a poet of my own country,
to &s;uffocate him with Olympic du&s;t, or
barbarou&s;ly macerate him with the blows
of a Roman ce&s;tus, loaded with lead.
The idiom of our re&s;idence is a current
coin, but the languages of which men are
even ignorant of the pronunciation, are
only curious medals, to place in the
o&s;tentatious cabinet of the petty vir|tuo&s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>In the mean time every day &s;trengthen|ed
his connexions with our hero. He
enlarged his views with new a&s;pects of
<PB N="214" REF="237">
human life; pointed his knowledge with
&s;ome appo&s;ite anecdote not ea&s;ily for|gotten,
while it came always a&s;&s;ociated
with the ob&s;ervation; and while his pre|ceptive
truths were worthy of a &s;age of
antiquity, was &s;erious without formality,
and gay without frivolity. Charles con|ducted
him through the town; and &s;uch
was the ardour and curio&s;ity with which
Vaurien examined the metropolis, that if
Charles had not con&s;idered him as a great
philo&s;opher, he might have concluded he
was no carele&s;s &s;py.</P>
<P>Certain it was, that our hero often
marvelled, in the &s;implicity of his heart,
at &s;ome &s;ingular notions, which e&s;caped
the fertile imagination of the Frenchman.
In Saint George's Fields, he enquired, if
that was not the place, a certain lunatic
had a&s;&s;embled fifty-thou&s;and men?
&startq;Yes (replied Charles) it was here an
a&s;&s;embled mob &s;uddenly gathered, and
<PB N="215" REF="238">
rapidly diverging, the bur&s;ting flames
were viewed from various parts of the me|tropolis,
and the panic was more general
than the conflagration.&endq; &startq;It is ea&s;y (re|plied
Vaurien) to alarm an opulent city;
no men are &s;o timorous as the rich. I
have not yet &s;een in the&s;e environs, a
place more happily adapted for a battle
or an encampment; here London might
be be&s;ieged, or pillaged, while a mob
might be taught an orderly arrangement.
Men &s;oon become &s;oldiers; they have a
great aptitude for murdering each other.
Tho&s;e ob&s;tructing hou&s;es &s;hould be fir&s;t
pulled down, for that a few hours would
be &s;ufficient.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We are, thank Heaven (&s;aid Charles)
protected from &s;uch future alarms. It
would be now difficult to do, what a
lunatic once did.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;True, (replied Vaurien); but it hap|pens,
my friend, that what is mo&s;t diffi|cult,
is &s;ometimes mo&s;t &s;udden.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="239">
Vaurien could not pa&s;s St. Paul's with
out a re&s;olution to enter it's ball. &startq;That
is a noble height (he &s;aid) I love all
eminences. My mind ri&s;es with my
body; I was never more plea&s;ed than
when in pa&s;&s;ing the Alps, a thunder|&s;torm
&s;uddenly bur&s;t at my feet. Had
I been fifty yards lower, I had been anni|hilated.
The whirlwind, as it ru&s;hed afar,
over&s;et me. I loved, on the Pyrenees, to
&s;cale the ridgy rocks, to gaze on the dark
aby&s;s; and on the glacieres, to mark that
wa&s;te of nature, when a mountain di&s;|&s;olving,
thunders, rolls, and foams like
an ocean.&endq; When he was placed in the
ball, he looked down. &startq;How ridiculous
(&s;aid he) is the &s;carcely vi&s;ible &s;cene be|neath!
Not a &s;ound of it's eternal hub|bub
reacnes us; the carriages &s;eem to
glide in &s;ilence; we can &s;carcely perceive
tho&s;e proud, irrational, imperfect beings!
This place, Charles, is a &s;eat for a philo|&s;opher;
<PB N="217" REF="240">
here only do we feel the undi&s;|turbed
&s;ilence of the heavens.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And yet, my friend (he continued)
we can gain no true knowledge if we
keep too di&s;tant from men; we mu&s;t
mix among fools to learn what is wi&s;|dom.
Suppo&s;e a number of &s;ages were
born in this cupola, and knew nothing
more of mankind than what they could
di&s;cern at this elevation. How idle would
appear the ince&s;&s;ant motion of tho&s;e
minute bodies! they would find as lit|tle
intere&s;t in the &s;cene as we do in gaz|ing
on the pha&s;es of the moon. Believe
me, Charles, they would, however, con&s;i|der
their little republic of great con&s;e|quence.
You &s;mile&mdash;why the &s;tory is
our own! Tho&s;e ambulatory &s;ages be|low
form the very republic I de&s;cribe,
conceive them&s;elves of the utmo&s;t im|portance,
and look on the &s;cale of exi&s;t|ence
<PB N="218" REF="241">
without intelligence, and yet with
pride!&endq;</P>
<P>As they were returning from this ball,
which had given occa&s;ion to &s;o much
&s;ublime philo&s;ophy, that the hone&s;t
youth imagined Vaurien was in&s;pired,
finding no one to interrupt their curio&s;ity,
they rambled in this immen&s;e building,
which only receives the light from oc|ca&s;ional
crevices and loop-holes. It was
curious to examine the interior piles.
&startq;Charles (&s;aid Vaurien) your country|men
are un&s;u&s;picious. I am thinking with
what ea&s;e, if it were nece&s;&s;ary, combu&s;ti|bles
might be left here, which in a con|cealed
but certain manner would involve
this noble edifice in flames, while the
villanous incendiary would enjoy the view
in &s;ecurity.&endq;</P>
<P>Charles replied, &startq;It is very true Mr.
Vaurien; the keepers here are &s;hamefully
<PB N="219" REF="242">
negligent. But perhaps, like my&s;elf, &s;uch
a thought never entered their heads.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The French (&s;aid Vaurien) have very
inventive heads, and the Engli&s;h very
un&s;u&s;picious hearts.&endq;</P>
<P>Vaurien was de&s;irous of viewing the
armoury at the Tower, but no admit|tance
was at pre&s;ent to be obtained. The
dock-yards at Plymouth he would take
in his way to Devon&s;hire with his Lord|&s;hip;
&startq;I am curious (he ob&s;erved) to
view what con&s;titutes the force of every
country I inhabit. One gains but little
intelligence from the ha&s;ty traveller, or
the dry dictionary-maker. Whatever I
view with my own eyes always &s;upplies me
with new ideas, even if they &s;hould
only &s;erve to correct the blunders of other
people.&endq;</P>
<P>The talents and the virtues of Vaurien
daily won the affections of Charles. To
his knowledge, Vaurien had given many
<PB N="220" REF="243">
evidences of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted di&s;po|&s;itions;
and, &s;ince his progre&s;s in the
Engli&s;h language, had reconciled many
di&s;&s;entions in the hou&s;e to the &s;atisfac|tion
of both parties. Lord Belfield had
in&s;i&s;ted on &s;upplying him with money,
and this was liberally di&s;tributed among
the hou&s;ehold, nor refu&s;ed to paupers.
&startq;If your government (&s;aid he) would
oblige the idle to labour, your &s;treets
would not &s;o frequently offend the eye
of humanity; in China there is no poor.
All men can labour; the blind can turn
a wheel; the lame can perform what
depends on the eye; age may have it's
&s;edentary, and even childhood it's active
employments.&endq; Every mouth echoed
the prai&s;es of Vaurien. In the boudoir
and the drawing-room his accompli&s;h|ments
&s;eemed inexhau&s;tible; various,
they never tired with the &s;amene&s;s of
excellence; facility, that charm of ge|nius,
<PB N="221" REF="244">
gave it's peculiar grace to his mo&s;t
fini&s;hed efforts. No man appeared more
de&s;erving, and &s;eemed le&s;s &s;olicitous of
prai&s;e. Lady Belfield was enchanted by
the amenity of his manners; his Lord|&s;hip,
by the ver&s;atility of his conver&s;ation,
and by certain projects that bound him
&s;till more clo&s;ely; Charles viewed him as
a model of humanity and ta&s;te. The
philo&s;ophic circle con&s;idered him as an
acqui&s;ition of rare value; Dragon
thought him not deficient in &s;pirit;
Libel di&s;covered a rich mine of anec|dote
to fill his columns; and the atra|bilarious
Subtile even cea&s;ed to &s;peak,
to attend to the &s;yren &s;weetne&s;s of Vau|rien,
while Mr. Reverberator clapped
his applau&s;e, and remembered his exact
expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>John&s;on was in&s;en&s;ibly &s;upplanted by
Vaurien in the affections of Charles.
&startq;John&s;on (&s;aid our hero) is a man of
<PB N="222" REF="245">
ob&s;ervation, but he had been no traveller.
There is a contraction in his views, an
a&s;perity in his manners, and a deficiency
in ta&s;te for the politer accompli&s;hments.
Vaurien is a citizen of the world; he
feels no prejudices of attachment, there|fore,
for any per&s;on or any place; be&s;ides
he is liberal, for he &s;peaks with kindne&s;s
of John&s;on, but John&s;on never com|mends
in him what in another he would
deem worthy of the highe&s;t prai&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>But there was &s;omething of a very
&s;ecret nature lurking in the heart of
Charles, which prompted this compari&s;on
more favourable to the Gaul than the
Briton. Charles had generou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
Mrs. Wil&s;on in a &s;mall &s;hop of gro|cery;
and when the young man inge|nuou&s;ly
related the whole affair to John|&s;on,
he &s;miled, &s;arca&s;tically ob&s;erving,
&startq;that women of a certain age &s;eemed
the reigning ta&s;te;&endq; and, mi&s;conceiving
<PB N="223" REF="246">
the benevolence of Charles, gave an ad|vice
more hone&s;t than plea&s;ant, on bad
connections. But Vaurien, when the &s;e|cret
was confided to him, in&s;tantly ap|plauded
the de&s;ign: &startq;I can &s;pare a trifle
my&s;elf to increa&s;e the &s;tock of Mrs. Wil|&s;on;
I con&s;ider it a tribute I pay to
virtue, and a favour I owe to friend&s;hip.
She is a &s;i&s;ter of an unfortunate cla&s;s of
human beings, and my heart bleeds
when I think that this numerous cla&s;s
are de&s;erted females! we call them by
the ugly name of pro&s;titute; but the
voice of humanity &s;oftens the di&s;gu&s;ting
appellation; &s;uch a woman, is &startq;a mother

the hou&s;e maintain it&s;elf. Should this
to &s;ome appear mere trifling to narrate,
it is, with another paragraph in the&s;e
volumes<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. page 118.</NOTE>, propo&s;ed as worthy of the at|tention
of a &s;hop-keeper. They were
taken by two per&s;ons, who, as they are
not to be pa&s;&s;ed over ha&s;tily in this
work, we &s;hall pay great re&s;pect to their
fir&s;t appearance, and which, as they are
only ob&s;cure lodgers in ob&s;cure apart|ments,
is doing more than what any
whole neighbourhood would in the&s;e two
great cities.</P>
<P>The&s;e two per&s;ons then were a male
and a female, and very courteou&s;ly were
they received by Mrs. Wil&s;on, without
requiring any references to their friends,
<PB N="227" REF="250">
which was &s;o far fortunate, as it would
have put them to the painful confe&s;&s;ion,
that in this micro-univer&s;e of London
they had no friends at all. The reader
is on the point of ha&s;tily condemning
Mrs. Wil&s;on's negligence, and we entreat
any infantine &s;enile virgin not to exclaim,
&startq;This is ju&s;t what might be expected
from <HI>&s;uch</HI> women!&endq; in our opinion there
was more of humanity than of negligence
in this voluntary omi&s;&s;ion of Mrs. Wil|&s;on;
the relation&s;hip of the&s;e two per|&s;ons
could not ea&s;ily have been mi&s;taken,
for the man was an old Beli&s;arius, who
&s;eemed to &s;ink in the earth as he &s;up|ported
him&s;elf on the arm of an angel,
by her beauty, but evidently a poor &s;uf|fering
woman, by the &s;orrows that had
touched her pale features with a melan|choly
grace. Now, if the reader has
not di&s;covered by this time that the&s;e
two per&s;ons were a father and a daughter,
we &s;hall conceive it as a great favour if
<PB N="228" REF="251">
he would quietly lay down our book,
and bid us an eternal farewell.</P>
<P>The name of the old man was Lieu|tenant
Balfour. Had Hogarth viewed
him, he had drawn a figure either &s;ingu|lar
for the ridiculous or the pathetic;
the &s;ublime and the burle&s;que are too
often &s;o clo&s;ely neighbouring, that it
entirely depends on the ta&s;te of the arti&s;t
to make the &s;ame object affectingly &s;e|rious
or provokingly ri&s;ible.</P>
<P>Balfour, in his exterior, was literally a
fragment of human nature, and an evi|dence
that the &s;ource of life mu&s;t lie
concealed in &s;ome ob&s;cure corner of the
human body, and cannot be di&s;per&s;ed
through all its parts. If we had the
nece&s;&s;ary time allowed us, here might be
a fine exhibition of our recondite re|&s;earches
relating to the pineal gland, the
white medullary &s;ub&s;tance of the brain,
the &s;ubtile matter of De&s;cartes, and the
<PB N="229" REF="252">
vibrations of Harvey; but all the&s;e co|pious
proofs of our great erudition we
with pangs conceal, preferring the plea|&s;ures
of our incurious readers. We do
not however agree with any &s;y&s;tem of our
predece&s;&s;ors, as that would be quite un|cu&s;tomary,
and little inventive.</P>
<P>For our part we do mo&s;t humbly con|ceive,
that the &s;ource of our exi&s;tence
lies in a certain mu&s;cular part, &s;ituated in
the middle of the thorax, but being of
a pyramidal form, brings it's point for|ward
to the front of the brea&s;t. Into
this re&s;ervoir of humanity flows all the
generous blood of <HI>noble men</HI> (we mean
tho&s;e who are &s;o by nature, and not by
title), and by the dilatation or contrac|tion
of the part we morali&s;ts generally
a&s;certain the degree of manhood of every
human form. It mo&s;t con&s;equentially
follows, that a &startq;tun of fle&s;h&endq; may not
contain more of the true principles of
<PB N="230" REF="253">
life than the &s;lighte&s;t ve&s;&s;el, which na|ture
or fortune &s;eems to have treated
with the utmo&s;t carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. When <HI>the
heart</HI> is well placed, it &s;prings with a
warm dilatation, &s;o that it may happen
that a poor unpromoted lieutenant, like
Balfour, &s;hall have his brea&s;t more nobly
and amply filled than even a yellow
admiral's<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e gentlemen are u&s;ually termed by the tars&mdash;; but one mu&s;t not write the unvarni&s;hed words of truth in the pre&s;ent mo&s;t varni&s;hing age.</NOTE>, though his body, like a
&s;hattered frigate after a glorious engage|ment,
be di&s;ma&s;ted, and left a mere
wreck, and as the French, in their me|taphorical
&s;tyle, &s;ay, &startq;all covered with
glory;&endq; and, indeed, the body of our
afore&s;aid lieutenant had little other
covering, which, however, did not ex|cite
in him &s;o much anger as humour,
ob&s;erving generally, when he looked over
the Gazette promotions, that <HI>he</HI> &s;eemed
<PB N="231" REF="254">
to be &s;ent only into this world to be
&s;hot at; and he generally clo&s;ed this ob|&s;ervation
with drinking the king's health,
that is, when he had the wine.</P>
<P>This old man now appeared, led in by
his daughter; a broad black &s;ilk bandage
covered his eyes, which was not worn for
his own convenience, but for that of any
friends; to him it &s;ignified little whether
his eyes were covered or uncovered, &s;ince
in both ca&s;es his vi&s;ion was exactly the
&s;ame. One eye indeed had been dropt
many years ago in boarding a ve&s;&s;el, al|though
he had not yet &s;hared in the
prize-money; it's companion had been
lately lo&s;t by a gutta &s;erena. He had
but one arm, and he only lamented that
it was not the right, as that might have
&s;pared his dear Emily many trouble&s;ome
attentions; he was not born, however,
with one arm, but the other being rather
bu&s;ily employed in grappling with &s;ome
<PB N="232" REF="255">
Frenchmen, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary by
them to get rid of it; one of his legs the
Spaniards had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; and
he had two deep &s;cars on one cheek, left
by the &s;nikker-&s;nee of the Dutchmen's
&s;hort knives, which they u&s;ed at the
Dogger bank. This is an inventory of
the di&s;memberments of Balfour, which
his mode&s;ty could not hide; I &s;hall
however aver, that Balfour was a whole
man, for his heart was well placed.</P>
<P>Should the reader feel any intere&s;t in
what relates to this poor battered old
lieutenant, it can only be our defici|ency,
if he peru&s;es the following account
with the apathy of &s;ome lords of the
admiralty.</P>
<P>Balfour had never been rich, but he
had received the education of a gentle|man,
de&s;igned at an early period for the
navy of Great Britain. His father had
rarely tru&s;ted him to the uncertain hand
<PB N="233" REF="256">
of a preceptor, and beneath the &s;anctity
of the dome&s;tic roof had concealed from
him the depravity of a luxurious age.
When at length he i&s;&s;ued into life, to his
great mortification he could find no a&s;|&s;ociates.
With him temperance had be|come
a habit, and &s;tudy a ta&s;te; his
companions regarded him with contempt;
Balfour was not heard to complain; his
plea&s;ures were &s;ilent and concealed.</P>
<P>About this period he lo&s;t his father,
whom he called the rigid preceptor of his
youth, and the plea&s;ant companion of his
maturity. The father had not died un&s;atis|fied
with exi&s;tence; the reflection of the
future life of that &s;on melted like a &s;cattered
&s;weetne&s;s over his departing &s;pirit. He
rai&s;ed him&s;elf with a proud &s;atisfaction on
the bed of death; &startq;Ob&s;cure as I am (he
cried) I have bequeathed to my country
the rich legacy of one of it's valuable
citizens.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="257">
Balfour was left indeed by his father
with many virtues, but with no money;
two rea&s;ons which alike de&s;troyed the
friend&s;hips of the world. A mi&s;take,
not &s;ingular in a youth of his di&s;po&s;itions,
&s;erved to embitter his age. At the fir&s;t
period of active life he was not &s;en|&s;ible
that he wanted for either friends or
fortune. He thought, that what we owe
to favour was a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion u&s;urped or
precarious, enjoyed without tranquillity;
but what we obtain by merit is unalien|able
as a per&s;onal e&s;tate: he therefore
devoted him&s;elf to profe&s;&s;ional &s;tudies,
as the proper means of his advancement;
but he &s;oon began to perceive how much
a man's fortune depends on his connec|tions.</P>
<P>He met occa&s;ionally repul&s;es, which
wounded the dignity of his character.
His pa&s;&s;ions were efferve&s;cent, and his
di&s;cernment too delicate for the ea&s;e of
<PB N="235" REF="258">
his pa&s;&s;ions. His character was of a tem|per
too fine for common u&s;e; it was an
in&s;trument adapted only for great and
momentous occa&s;ions. He read of illu&s;|trious
characters, a&s;pired to imitate what
he had admired, and acted and conver&s;ed
with a &s;ublimity rarely comprehended
and frequently ridiculed. His manners
contracted a moro&s;ity, and his di&s;po&s;itions
a mi&s;anthropy, of which he was not &s;en|&s;ible.
For the &s;en&s;itive Balfour &s;olitude,
the &s;ole refuge of elevated minds, was
his con&s;olation; glory was the aliment of
his &s;oul; and the contemplation of his
romantic feelings a &s;ource of aweful en|joyment.
The plea&s;ures of memory were
not his plea&s;ures; the pre&s;ent moment
was not his exi&s;tence; his fervid genius
lived only in the ideal of the future; and
his life was a life of anticipation and di&s;|appointment.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="259">
Forty years he fought the battles of
his country, and had only once ki&s;&s;ed
the king's hand, which honour he con|fe&s;&s;ed
was more owing to accident than
di&s;tinction. But he loved his king, and
the remembrance was cheri&s;hed like the
recollection of a victory or a promotion.
With victory he had been familiar, but
promotion never reached the friendle&s;s
lieutenant; he &s;aw, indeed, that what
he expected to have obtained was now
given to the younger brother of an earl,
the third cou&s;in of a duke, and once to
the &s;on of a pillaging keeper of the king's
&s;tores. &startq;I &s;ee now,&endq; &s;aid Balfour, &startq;it
mu&s;t come round to me.&endq; He lived
under the ungentlene&s;s of fortune, un|con&s;cious
of it's ungentlene&s;s; but at
length, battered and broken down with
the la&s;t lo&s;s, that of his right arm, he
was obliged to retire on half pay.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="260">
Balfour was not only born to be &s;hot
at by his fellow men, but to receive all
&startq;the arrows of outrageous fortune.&endq; He
felt the lo&s;s of an amiable woman at this
period, when love alone remained faith|ful,
while hope and glory had proved
traitors. The connubial voice that whi&s;|pered
peace had cea&s;ed, and the lamp
of love was only lighted in a &s;epulchre.
The hero and the philo&s;opher died away
in the blind, old, helple&s;s man. He had
two children, Edward, who had entered
into the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t India Com|pany,
but who, in a battle with Tippoo
Saib, was among the mi&s;&s;ing men. Since
that account had been received, he had
become more feeble and &s;ilent; he pined
daily, and his &s;oul &s;ickened with de&s;pon|dence.
His daughter Emily devoted her
days to his comfort; her tones were gay,
while a tear often trickled on her cheek;
<PB N="238" REF="261">
&s;he fed him and amu&s;ed him, but her
care&s;&s;es &s;eemed only to excite a keener
agony. He would &s;ometimes lean over
her face, but &s;hed no tears; his noble
heart was broken, and he was now too
old to weep.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Death of Lieutenant Balfour.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Lieutenant and his daughter
were ju&s;t arrived from their re&s;idence
at Exmouth in Devon&s;hire. The jour|ney
to London had entirely originated in
the ob&s;tinate affection of Emily, who,
&s;ince her father had lo&s;t the total u&s;e of
his eye, and was thus deprived of the
&s;olitary inlet of plea&s;ure which remained,
found the pain of exi&s;tence intolerable.
The apothecary was of opinion, that it
might be po&s;&s;ible to remove the film
that over&s;pread the pupil of the eye;
but the heavy expence of the journey,
and the uncertainty of the cure, had
always rendered Balfour aver&s;e to this
<PB N="240" REF="263">
project, and he ob&s;erved, &startq;that for a
poor old lieutenant like him&s;elf, it was
incurring funeral charges fit only for an
admiral; be&s;ides (he would add) my dear
Emily, this village is better adapted for
me to die in, and you to live in.&endq; But
Emily cea&s;ed not her importunities; and
one day having heard of a happy cure
performed by Baron Wenzel, &s;he knelt
before her father, and extorted a &s;olemn
promi&s;e to place him&s;elf under the care of
this oculi&s;t.</P>
<P>Such was the purport of this journey.
To Balfour it was as aweful a tran&s;port as
if he had travelled alive in his her&s;e. It
however awakened in him tho&s;e powers
that had long &s;eemed extinct. But his
mind, entirely ab&s;orbed in the fate of his
fair daughter, her &s;eduction appeared to
him di&s;gui&s;ed in a hundred forms. As
he proceeded every &s;light thing &s;ounded
ominou&s;ly fatal to his &s;ombrous fancy.
<PB N="241" REF="264">
The crack of the coachman's whip &s;hook
his nerves; the whirl of the coach obliged
him often to draw his hand to his head;
the dinner conver&s;ations of the travellers
alarmed, and he took Emily frequently
a&s;ide to enquire who were their com|panions.
When they reached the paved
&s;treets of London, and their ear was a&s;|&s;aulted
by the tumultuous hubbub, he
gra&s;ped the hand of his daughter, and
whi&s;pered her, never to quit him a &s;ingle
moment. All the&s;e were objects which
&s;ome twenty years ago exhilarated his
&s;pirits, but now they were a&s;&s;ociated
with the perils of his daughter. The
contra&s;t was too violent for his &s;en&s;itive
frame; he had ju&s;t left a quiet cottage,
rural walks, and conver&s;ations which had
only &s;oothed his ear. He &s;upported
him&s;elf with a decent fortitude before
his fellow travellers; he recollected
that he &s;till wore an old blue coat,
<PB N="242" REF="265">
with yellow buttons which had an an|chor
engraved on them. A veneration
for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice partly kept
up his &s;pirits; but having at length
reached the apartment of Mrs. Wil&s;on,
he &s;unk back in his chair, and &s;wooned.</P>
<P>The minute attentions, and the fre|quent
care&s;&s;es Emily be&s;towed on her
father, charmed the good Mrs. Wil&s;on,
who voluntarily offered her aid in every
thing &s;he could perform. &startq;I am afraid,
(&s;aid Emily,) we &s;hall prove but trouble|&s;ome
lodgers, and &s;hall &s;tand in need of
all the humanity you can be&s;tow on us.
My father has lately been afflicted with a
fever on his &s;pirits, and his temper is
irritable, &s;ince the lo&s;s of my brother.
But when he gets a little more &s;trength,
he has given me his promi&s;e to be
couched; and he holds his promi&s;es
inviolate. I hope &s;oon that he will &s;ee
the per&s;on to whom we are already in|debted
for &s;o much goodne&s;s.&endq; Mrs.
<PB N="243" REF="266">
Wil&s;on &s;ympathi&s;ed with her fair lodger,
and, charmed by her di&s;po&s;itions, and de|lighted
by her accompli&s;hments, &s;he con|tracted
the pure&s;t friend&s;hip. Her lod|gers
had not been there many weeks,
when &s;he took an opportunity of men|tioning
to Charles and Vaurien the &s;in|gular
excellence her little habitation con|tained.
Emily excited their curio&s;ity;
but as &s;he rarely quitted her father in the
day, it was &s;ome time before they could
&s;ee her. When the lieutenant retired to
his early re&s;t, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a few hours in
conver&s;ation with Mrs. Wil&s;on, whom
&s;he found intelligent and &s;ympathetic.</P>
<P>The&s;e conver&s;ations were well adapted
to confirm their friend&s;hip. They felt a
reciprocal want of con&s;olation; both were
&s;olitary females; the whole univer&s;e was
as nothing to them; there was a painful
vacuity in their hearts, which was filled
by the tenderne&s;s of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="267">
When a per&s;on of &s;en&s;ibility has re|ceived
an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice from another,
it is a gratification to relate it. The re|collection
is a continual oppre&s;&s;ion on
the feelings, and the communication frees
us in an-in&s;tant. Gratitude opened the
lips of Mrs. Wil&s;on much more than
tho&s;e voluble communicative di&s;po&s;itions,
which have been generally &s;uppo&s;ed to
form a great portion of a woman's conver|&s;ation.
But there are ca&s;es, when even
the utmo&s;t ardour of gratitude cannot
induce us to relate <HI>all</HI> the kindne&s;s of
another, when that would &s;erve merely to
exhibit our&s;elves in a degrading light.</P>
<P>She therefore with equal gratitude
and prudence mentioned, that &s;he had
been left the widow of a bankrupt, with
four children, and when reduced to de|&s;pair,
in the di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence of
two friends found a&s;&s;i&s;tance to purcha&s;e
her little &s;hop. She mentioned this in|deed
<PB N="245" REF="268">
as a proof of a particular provi|dence,
and as an extraordinary circum|&s;tance.
Now I de&s;ire the reader to ob|&s;erve,
that Emily di&s;&s;ented <HI>in toto</HI> from
this opinion; fir&s;t, becau&s;e in the &s;im|plicity
of her heart &s;he found nothing
extraordinary in the &s;uccour &s;o charita|bly
be&s;towed on a widow and four chil|dren;
and &s;econdly, her father had never
taught her, that there was any rea&s;on to
&s;uppo&s;e the my&s;terious operation of a
particular providence. The &s;ubject, in|$$ed,
they had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; but the lieu|tenant
u&s;ed generally to conclude by
pointing to his one leg and his one eye, and
particularly to a very thread-bare blue
coat which formed his whole wardrobe.</P>
<P>One day when Charles and Vaurien
were conver&s;ing with Mrs. Wil&s;on, Emily
&s;tept down for her harp, which &s;he had
left the preceding evening in the back
parlour of her friend. As &s;he entered,
<PB N="246" REF="269">
Charles mode&s;tly rai&s;ed his eyes on her,
withdrew them, and again ventured to
gaze with a timid re&s;olution. He &s;aw a
grace, a blu&s;hing grace; and that fini&s;h|ed
form, a&s;&s;ociated with the excellence
he had heard, came like an enchantment
over his heart; he bowed, was &s;ilent
and motionle&s;s. Vaurien threw over the
whole form of Emily a rapid glance; it
looked at the face, darted into the bo|&s;om,
fixed on the arm, and wandered in
the mo&s;t voluptuous variety. The di&s;|concerted
Emily &s;eemed for a moment
to forget the object for which &s;he had
entered the room; &s;he murmured &s;ome|thing
of an apology; &s;he took the harp;
her hand trembled; &s;he let it fall; Vau|rien
flew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; her hand
came in contact with his; &s;he reddened,
and quitted the room in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;She is indeed amiable! and faultle&s;s
in her form as in her heart,&endq; &s;aid Charles.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="270">
&startq;Upon my &s;oul (cried Vaurien) &s;he is
the fine&s;t woman I have &s;een in Eng|land.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She is the be&s;t, I am &s;ure&endq; (added Mrs.
Wil&s;on).</P>
<P>&startq;And her father is quite blind?&endq; en|quired
Vaurien maliciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>&startq;She does not quit him a minute&endq;
(replied Mrs. Wil&s;on, &s;imply).</P>
<P>&startq;What filial affection!&endq; exclaimed
Charles, &s;incerely.</P>
<P>Vaurien run on in great volubility.
&startq;She cannot be more than eighteen.
The touch of her arm is enough to cor|rupt
a Carthu&s;ian! Her lips are two ro&s;e
leaves! Her eyes, her bo&s;om, her no&s;e,
perfect Grecian! Did you ob&s;erve her
foot, Charles, when &s;he leant for the harp?
I &s;hall like that harp for it's falling&mdash;what
an attitude it gave us! Why, &s;he
is a model for the colouring of the pain|ter
and the chi&s;&s;el of the &s;tatuary.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="271">
&startq;Mr. Vaurien (&s;aid Mrs. Wil&s;on) you
talk of her in your national manner.
You look on the beauty and forget the
woman.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why indeed (replied Vaurien) one
can only de&s;cribe what one feels. Her
virtues are no doubt great; one might
&s;ee that by her provincial &s;implicity. A
blind father too would be an affecting
incident even in a romance. We have
one on this very &s;ubject in French, but
it is rather a little dry, and if the hero
had not been blind I am afraid our &s;ym|pathy
had not been put to the trial by
the grave lectures of his philo&s;ophy. But
tru&s;t me, now &s;he is gone, I only ima|gine
to have &s;een a fine picture.&endq;</P>
<P>During this colloquy Charles con|tinued
as &s;ilent and motionle&s;s as when
Emily was in the parlour. To have &s;een
her was to have loved her. Vaurien
was all gaiety of heart and volubility of
<PB N="249" REF="272">
tongue; Charles was pen&s;ive and &s;ilent,
and left the hou&s;e of Mrs. Wil&s;on with
a regret he had never yet felt. He car|ried
away in his heart an emotion that
prevailed over all others. He was more
engaged in love, in five minutes, than a
Frenchman, with all it's analytical me|taphy&s;ics,
could be in as many years.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t now return to our he|roine,
who in this moment is a&s;cending
pretty quickly the &s;tair ca&s;e. Emily had
accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to little monologues,
which &s;ome great ob&s;erver of human na|ture
has mo&s;t truely called, &startq;thinking
aloud.&endq; By the means of the&s;e monolo|gues
her father, who had cea&s;ed to &s;ee
her for years, knew whatever &s;he was em|ployed
about, and literally <HI>heard</HI> every
&s;ingle emotion that fluttered in her inno|cent
heart. As &s;oon as &s;he had reached
the door of her apartment &s;he &s;lackened
her &s;teps, and entered, &s;aying, &startq;I am
<PB N="250" REF="273">
very thoughtle&s;s;&endq; and &s;o &s;he quietly &s;hut
the door, as if &s;he had now re&s;olved to
u&s;e caution even in the minute&s;t thing.</P>
<P>&startq;What is my love thoughtle&s;s in?&endq;
&s;aid Balfour; for being, as the reader
knows, very blind, he was apt to be won|derfully
quick in li&s;tening.</P>
<P>&startq;Only in a trifle I hope, &s;ir. Having
left my harp la&s;t night in Mrs. Wil&s;on's
back parlour, I &s;tept down for it, and
without thinking of the impropriety, I
opened the door, and &s;he was engaged
with her two friends.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mrs. Wil&s;on &s;eems a very kind land|lady,
and &s;he will not be ea&s;ily offended;
and I dare &s;ay, Emily, neither will the
other two ladies.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear &s;ir, had they been ladies I
&s;hould not have trembled as I did, and
let fall my harp. They are two charita|ble
gentlemen, who out of humanity
&s;et her up in this little &s;hop, and without
<PB N="251" REF="274">
which, &s;he a&s;&s;ures me, &s;he mu&s;t have
&s;tarved.&endq;</P>
<P>Balfour interrupted his daughter, and
appeared in great emotion&mdash;&startq;Two cha|ritable
gentlemen who &s;et her up in a
&s;hop!&mdash;Almighty God! art thou inex|orable
to the prayer of a father? Ha&s;t
thou brought here to peri&s;h his de&s;erted
child? When thou did&s;t expo&s;e me to the
buffetting mockeries of the worthle&s;s I
was patient; when thou did&s;t di&s;member
me, limb by limb, I murmured not;
when thou tooke&s;t away my &s;on, I gave
but a father's &s;igh; when thou did&s;t
&s;natch my wife from my bo&s;om, I bowed,
and the pang I felt was for this child&mdash;but
now thou ha&s;t cru&s;hed me to the
grave, and thou ha&s;t made my &s;oul ta&s;te
of the bitterne&s;s of death.&endq;&mdash;He pau&s;ed,
then cried out&mdash;&startq;Emily, Emily, where
are you?&mdash;Give me your hand.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="275">
Emily was trembling with con&s;terna|tion
and &s;urpri&s;e. She was kneeling at
his feet; her face was covered with her
hands, and &s;he leant upon his knees;
&s;carcely could &s;he &s;ay, &startq;My father, my
father, what means this?&endq; Emily wept;
the old blind Balfour pa&s;&s;ed his hand
over her face to wipe her tears. He
gra&s;ped her folded hands, and exclaimed
&mdash;&startq;My child, my child, we mu&s;t be in a
bad hou&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A bad hou&s;e! impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ir! Did
you but know Mrs. Wil&s;on, you would
acknowledge her for the kinde&s;t of wo|men.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Cur&s;ed hypocrite! What, &s;he is
young, and gay, and dre&s;&s;y, and, I &s;up|po&s;e,
very agreeable in conver&s;ation?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah no, &s;ir! &s;he is of an advanced
age; is never gay; decent but poorly dre&s;|&s;ed,
and her conver&s;ation is &s;erious, and
&s;o far agreeable.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="276">
&startq;Then &s;he is &s;ome worn out harridan
&mdash;under&s;tand me, child, &s;ome procure&s;s!
I &s;hall now hate that &s;ympathi&s;ing canting
voice. I wondered why &s;he &s;hould be
&s;o kind to a poor old blind man, but I
&s;ee it was for the young daughter!
Emily, Emily, thou wilt be bought and
&s;old. We mu&s;t depart, this week; we
mu&s;t depart. Did I not foretell this?
Did I not premoni&s;h? But I mu&s;t
yield to the per&s;ua&s;ions of a &s;imple
girl! O Emily, your goodne&s;s checks
my anger. If we were but at Exmouth!
There I would have died like a man&mdash;I tell
you, fooli&s;h girl! you can know nothing
of human nature&mdash;dear good Emily, you
have always lived at the &s;ide of a blind
helple&s;s father&mdash;yes, yes, I &s;ee your fate
&mdash;my God! my God! the thought is
agonizing! help me, my child, help; I
am &s;ick, I am very &s;ick, child&mdash;I&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="277">
As he was &s;peaking, the terrified Emily
ob&s;erved his features alter; they writhed,
looked gha&s;tly and he &s;unk in his chair
&s;eemingly a breathle&s;s cor&s;e. She rang
loudly; Mrs. Wil&s;on ha&s;tened to her re|lief;
the apothecary was called, and was
not long in deciding that all medical aid
was in vain; it was a &s;evere paralytic
&s;troke, which could not fail to terminate
the life of the feeble old man.</P>
<P>Balfour with great difficulty combated
with nature for a few days. He gradually
recovered his &s;en&s;es, but they were feeble
and exanimate. His powerful emotions
were exhau&s;ted, and only a tincture of
his native &s;en&s;ibility remained in his de|bilitated
frame, like that racine&s;s which
the empty ve&s;&s;el retains, when all it's
noble &s;pirits are poured out.</P>
<P>Emily watched over him by day and
by night. Mrs. Wil&s;on performed the
<PB N="255" REF="278">
duties of humanity. But nature was
cea&s;ing her operations.</P>
<P>Balfour de&s;ired Emily to approach his
bed, and delivered him&s;elf in the following
words:</P>
<P>&startq;Emily, are we alone? My child, the
hour has come; the chillne&s;s of death
already benumbs me. Approach, my
love!&endq; he ki&s;&s;ed her forehead as &s;he leant
over his face, while her arm &s;upported
his head&mdash;&startq;Emily, you have acted nobly
as a daughter. Since fate has reduced
me to a &s;tate of infancy, more cruel than
the fir&s;t, to your father you have been a
parent. If virtue in this idle exi&s;tence
were it's own reward, I &s;hould have died
happy&mdash;but Balfour has been virtuous
and mi&s;erable.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My father (&s;aid Emily) re&s;pect the
my&s;terious award of the Divinity. This is
an hour of trial; have you not taught
me, by your words and your actions, the
<PB N="256" REF="279">
magnanimity of fortitude? Have you not
often repeated, that virtue has it's &s;elf-enjoyment?
You, my father, have been a
hero and a philo&s;opher; I have &s;een you
&s;mile in &s;orrow. Con&s;ecrate the bed of
death, and teach me how to die.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ble&s;&s;ed be that voice! (cried Bal|four)
that recalls the warm blood that
had almo&s;t de&s;erted my heart. I feel
a new &s;pirit, my Emily! you have de|prived
death of it's pang. Yes! I know
my girl is worthy of her father&mdash;Emily,
your guilele&s;s youth will be&s;tow a virtuous
age. But what will you do, poor and
abandoned, without even your blind fa|ther
to advi&s;e? Oh! had my Emily but
a partner of her exi&s;tence, an hone&s;t
though a menial employment!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My father, you have made me the
creature that I am;&mdash;fear not then for
me&mdash;my virtue is my dower, my talents
my inheritance!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="280">
&startq;Noble girl! I FEAR THE WORLD!
my voice refu&s;es to give my thoughts&mdash;my
brain is confu&s;ed&mdash;O would nature give
another hour! Be fortitude your pride!
When you &s;ee vice you will abhor it;
'tis incongruous with your &s;en&s;ations.
But FEAR THE VIRTUOUS! &s;u&s;pect the
di&s;intere&s;ted; be cautious of the cour|teous;
believe not the profe&s;&s;or of truth;
fly the agreeable; and tru&s;t no one with
the &s;implicity of your heart. Your part,
Emily, in life, is to be on the defen&s;ive.
A&s;&s;ociate with few; find independence in
your own character. Learn from a dying
father, that you can only be &s;ecure on
this earth by &s;u&s;pecting every appearance
of virtue. The error will be rare, and
the virtuous will forgive. It is my la&s;t
reque&s;t that you quit this hou&s;e. The
woman is kind; tell her &s;he has the
thanks of a dying man; but the blind
are &s;u&s;picious. In this town, when a
<PB N="258" REF="281">
woman owes her &s;upport to two young
men, it is under&s;tood by what means
youth becomes &s;o charitable.&mdash;Alas! I
had much to &s;ay, but my thoughts die
before me. I feel a chillne&s;s at my heart.
La&s;t night I dreamt, or I &s;aw in my
thoughts, your mother and Edward&mdash;I
go to join two angels. Emily&mdash;Emily&mdash;pray
for me!!&endq;</P>
<P>She was now kneeling at the bed &s;ide
&mdash;one hand cla&s;ped that of her dying
father&mdash;the other was rai&s;ed to heaven.
As &s;he &s;poke, her harmonious tones
ro&s;e with the fervour of her prayer.
Balfour &s;eemed for a moment to be re|called
from another world&mdash;his face in|clined
towards the hand of Emily to
imprint a la&s;t and parting ki&s;s&mdash;his
face inclined, but in the &s;truggle he
expired!</P>

<PB N="259" REF="282">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Embarra&s;&s;ments of Emily, and the
Character of a Lady who had no Cha|racter.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the la&s;t melancholy honours
were paid to Balfour, when the
tear of his daughter had fallen into his
grave, and the perturbations of Emily's
mind had a little &s;ub&s;ided, the fir&s;t in|tere&s;ting
object that occurred to her was
the dying reque&s;t of her father to quit
the hou&s;e of Mrs. Wil&s;on. This gave
occa&s;ion to the following reflections.</P>
<P>&startq;How hard is it to comply with the
dictate of duty, when it comes uncon|genial
to that of the heart! In this uni|ver&s;e
I have no other friend than Mrs.
Wil&s;on; a friend&s;hip indeed of ye&s;ter|day's;
<PB N="260" REF="283">
but to the friendle&s;s even &s;uch a
friend&s;hip is &s;trong as that of a long du|ration.
In &s;o affectionate a form is there
concealed &s;o foul a di&s;po&s;ition? My father
could not &s;ee her; and even a vigorous
judgment &s;leeps when affection is too
wakeful, and trembles at fancied terrors.
Is human nature &s;o fraught with depra|vity
as that good man has in&s;tructed me?
Alas! this world was never the friend of
my father; he viewed all objects in their
cloudie&s;t a&s;pect. When he thought Mrs.
Wil&s;on young and gay, he &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t
be &s;ome pro&s;titute; but when I told him
&s;he was aged and &s;erious, then &s;he mu&s;t
be &s;ome procure&s;s. If I had told him
&s;he was an angel, he would have &s;aid,
that &s;he was only a di&s;gui&s;ed demon.
Yet, perhaps, there is &s;omething &s;ingu|lar
in the voluntary a&s;&s;i&s;tance from two
young men&mdash;and one of them really looks
not like a being that could have &s;o much
<PB N="261" REF="284">
humanity. If he had not frightened
me, I &s;hould not have dropt the harp;
what a dark quick fla&s;hing in his eyes!
I &s;hudder at the recollection! What an
in&s;olence in examining me with &s;uch
minutene&s;s! If what my father &s;aid were
true! O poor de&s;erted Emily! I will lock
my door every night, and I will quit the
hou&s;e this week.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And now what remains for me to &s;e|cure
my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? I have but a few
guineas my dear father &s;aved, I know
not how. Tho&s;e that want but little
can hardly have rea&s;on to de&s;pair. I am
mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o many in&s;truments, and
Mi&s;s Davies, by only teaching young la|dies
to play on the harp, got a very gen|teel
maintenance. My voice is good,
and I love to declaim; Mr. Sheridan
once told my father, that if I tried the
&s;tage I might become as rich as Mrs.
Siddons, for that I was worth all the
<PB N="262" REF="285">
commentators on Shake&s;peare. But none
of the&s;e employments will &s;uit me; I
&s;hould never be able to &s;upport a public
exhibition. I love an occupation where
I am quite alone; &s;omething that may
be done in one's own room quietly, with|out
the ob&s;ervation of other eyes. I have
&s;ome reputation for painting flowers on
&s;attin; and my dear Edward once told
me, that he &s;old my paintings of mid|night
groves for five guineas a-piece. I
can make $ace too. So I have nothing
more to do now than to prepare my
performances, and carry them to the fir&s;t
&s;hop. How grateful to one like me is the
tranquillity of occupation; it detaches
from many evils; from the li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of
exi&s;tence, the pangs of recollection, and
the de&s;pair of want.&endq;</P>
<P>This artle&s;s monologue was clo&s;ed with
a &s;igh to the &s;ad memory of her father;
&s;he thought of him with &s;uch fervency
of remembrance, that it &s;eemed a kind
<PB N="263" REF="286">
of &s;ilent prayer. She wiped away the
tears that glimmered on her eyes. She
placed her work ba&s;ket on the table, and
in taking out &s;ome mu&s;lin a card fell to
the ground. &startq;It is Mi&s;s Million's ad|dre&s;s
(cried Emily); now this is mo&s;t
fortunate. I had quite forgotten her;
I have not opened my ba&s;ket &s;ince I
have been in town. She will be glad to
&s;ee me, for &s;he repeated her invitations
a hundred times. She is a lady of great
fa&s;hion, and it will be ea&s;y for her to pro|cure
me a fine circle of purcha&s;ers for all
my little works.&endq;</P>
<P>The reader may po&s;&s;ibly recollect, that
in our route exhibition we hung up a
portrait of the father of this lady; an
important per&s;onage from the hours of
twelve to three at the Bank. As for
Mi&s;s Million her&s;elf, her character is
drawn with the utmo&s;t difficulty, being
one of tho&s;e irrational parts of the crea|tion
<PB N="264" REF="287">
that have no character at all. All that
we can &s;ay is, that &s;he was the daugh|ter
and heire&s;s of one of tho&s;e &s;tock|jobbing
citizens, who&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing for|tunes
ri&s;e like exhalations, and &s;ometimes
di&s;appear as &s;uddenly. Men who unite
at once the violent contra&s;t of the mo&s;t
&s;ordid penuriou&s;ne&s;s and the mo&s;t ridicu|lous
extravagance. Mi&s;s Million was ex|actly
like &s;o many other daughters of
&s;uch modern citizens of London, having
only one object, which &s;eemed to require
all her feeble faculties to accompli&s;h;
namely, a violent imitation of the ele|gance
and refinement of women of qua|lity.
But as this was only a later pur|&s;uit,
like young arti&s;ts, &s;he had not been
very &s;ucce&s;sful in her fir&s;t attempts; yet
&s;he had &s;ome favourable qualities to &s;hine
in a fa&s;hionable circle; &s;he abounded in
apathy, was tolerably illiterate, brilliant|ly
vain, fertilely capricious, and was in|ce&s;&s;antly
<PB N="265" REF="288">
calling out for <HI>la bagatelle,</HI> of
which her pronunciation was not quite
accurate. She &s;poke the French lan|guage
as often as the vulgar idiom, and
was a living proof that the maximum of
a fair citizen's knowledge of the Pari&s;ian
dialect did not exceed to that in old
Chaucer's day:
<Q><L>&startq;And French &s;he &s;pake faire and feteou&s;ly,</L>
<L>After the &s;chool of Stratford at Bow;</L>
<L>For French of Paris was to her unknow.&endq;</L>
<L>The PRIORESSE.</L></Q></P>
<P>On the whole, however, Mi&s;s Million,
by acquie&s;cing with every one, by dif|fu&s;ing
an univer&s;al &s;mile, by playing
deeply, and particularly by her &s;plendid
equipages, and &s;till more particularly
by her father's having purcha&s;ed the
necklace of the Queen of France, which
&s;he wore with great ea&s;e, was a favourite
of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="289">
About two years before the moment
at which our hi&s;tory is arrived, her father
had &s;old his omnium for &s;uch an ad|vanced
premium, that he re&s;olved to
quit his hou&s;e in Pudding Lane, to oc|cupy
one of the noble&s;t man&s;ions in Port|man
Square. She was &s;oon initiated into
the my&s;teries of high di&s;&s;ipation; every
per&s;on of fa&s;hion crowded to in&s;pect the
Queen of France's necklace; and Mi&s;s
Million was al&s;o con&s;picuous for &startq;a
rage&endq; for private ma&s;querades and bota|nical
&s;tudies. Hitherto, however, &s;he had
&s;een little of the fore&s;t &s;cenery of England,
excepting that part noticed by &startq;the
lerned clerke&endq;we ju&s;t quoted; and it
was at her villa at Dulwich that &s;he
fir&s;t formed&startq;the prophetic eye of ta&s;te.&endq;
She per&s;uaded her father to make an ex|cur&s;ion
into Devon&s;hire, where the Mar|gravine
of An&s;pach informed her, in the
expre&s;s words that polite authore&s;s em|ploys
<PB N="267" REF="290">
in her elaborate and learned travels
to the Crimea, &startq;that the country had <HI>a
very genteel</HI> appearance;&endq;and likewi&s;e
Mrs. Radcliffe, in her novels, had re|peated
and repeated the expre&s;&s;ion of
&startq;the feature of the land&s;cape.&endq; This
united idea of &startq;the genteel feature&endq;
overflowed the &s;en&s;orium of Mi&s;s Million.
The &s;tockjobber, his daughter, and the
Queen of France's necklace, were whirled
down by four po&s;t hor&s;es; and if Mi&s;s
Million no more admired the lovely and
romantic hills of Devon than the dead
flats of Dulwich, it mu&s;t certainly be
attributed only to the mode of tra|velling.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s Million arrived at Ex|mouth,
greatly did that young lady
marvel at the effect of popular preju|dice.
That &s;pot &s;he had heard men|tioned
and admired in &s;everal polite
$ircles; yet to her it appeared a very
<PB N="268" REF="291">
mean village, by no means comparable
to her favourite Margate; and &s;he could
not ea&s;ily comprehend why &s;ome per&s;ons
&s;hould go two hundred miles to view the
&s;ea, which might be &s;een at le&s;s than
&s;eventy. She made this reflection, which
her father ob&s;erved was a very &s;en&s;ible
one, as they were walking on &s;ome of
it's hanging rocks, and which, &s;he as
&s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erved, &s;he dete&s;ted, becau&s;e
every rock was an acclivity like Highgate
Hill. Nothing now remained for the
amu&s;ement of this amiable young lady,
but an attempt to convert Exmouth
into a mimetic London; &s;he never went
out but to pay vi&s;its; &s;o that upon the
whole, had &s;he only <HI>heard</HI> &s;omething
about Exmouth, &s;he would have <HI>&s;een</HI> it
more than &s;he did at the place it&s;elf.
Her vi&s;its were, however, numerous; they
could not fail to be &s;o by the happy
&s;y&s;tem &s;he had adopted. She re&s;olved to
<PB N="269" REF="292">
vi&s;it two kinds of per&s;ons; fir&s;t, tho&s;e
who &s;he did know; and &s;econdly, tho&s;e
who &s;he did not know.</P>
<P>Among the latter was our dear Emily.
She had ob&s;erved her frequently leading
her father on Chapple Hill, where &s;he
re&s;ided. Whoever &s;aw Emily admired
the ea&s;y grace of her motions, and the
&s;implicity yet tenderne&s;s of her features.
One morning Emily appeared curiou&s;ly
engaged at a hedge; her father had re&s;ted
on the &s;od; at length &s;he plucked a wild
yellow ro&s;e, a flower which &s;ome con&s;ider
as a native of the &s;ofter climate of Devon.
When Emily had extricated this native
ro&s;e, in thoughtle&s;s rapture &s;he turned
to her father&mdash;&s;he &s;ighed and &s;hook her
head. &startq;What is the matter, my love?&endq;
&s;aid old Balfour. &startq;Nothing, nothing,&endq;
replied Emily. &startq;I was only thinking
you cannot any more admire your fa|vourite
ro&s;e; I have plucked one of the
<PB N="270" REF="293">
fine&s;t.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Talk not to me of ro&s;es, child&punc;&endq;
&s;aid Balfour peevi&s;hly; &startq;yet I can &s;till
&s;mell. Give it to me. 'Tis faint, Emily!&endq;
&mdash;&startq;Alas, Sir, it is <HI>only</HI> beautiful!&endq;
&s;aid the fair morali&s;t.</P>
<P>During this dialogue, Mi&s;s Million,
when &s;he perceived that Emily had
plucked a ro&s;e, &s;tarted, rever&s;ed her
chair, and hurried out in all the ardour
of botanical curio&s;ity, and as this curio|&s;ity
was infinitely greater than her know|ledge,
it led to no &s;hort conver&s;ation.
The following day &s;he favoured her dear
little botani&s;t (as &s;he called Emily)
with a vi&s;it, admired her flower paint|ings,
thought they were mon&s;trous fine,
and re&s;olved to rob her of one to hang
in Portman Square. Many vi&s;its were
received from Mi&s;s Million, and many
earne&s;t invitations were given for an ex|cur&s;ion
to the metropolis.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="294">
The&s;e vi&s;its were never oppo&s;ed by
Balfour; for he lamented the $ilial per&s;e|verance
of his Grecian daughter (as he
called Emily) for attending with &s;uch
&s;olicitude his impri&s;onment. When
&s;trangers came he only enquired whether
any officer accompanied them? Several
regiments quartered in the neighbour|hood
had already mole&s;ted the peace of
the quiet, and de&s;troyed the happine&s;s of
the innocent. &startq;Emily,&endq; he would &s;ay,
&startq;abhor the&s;e men! Our home troops are
now &s;uppo&s;ed to be merely trained for a
&s;tationary appearance. They con&s;i&s;t of
all the hot-brained youth in the king|dom;
frivolous and debauched, illiterate
and in&s;olent, they &s;eek for fortune by
plea&s;ing your &s;ex, and for honour by of|fending
their own. The partiality of
your &s;ex for &s;uch mean under&s;tandings
and &s;uch corrupt hearts has given occa|&s;ion
to &s;u&s;pect the imbecility of the fe|male
<PB N="272" REF="295">
character; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed your
ea&s;y attachments to officers are &s;imply
derived from their weakne&s;s and frivolity,
which place them more on a level with
women than any other cla&s;s of men.&endq;
For this har&s;h opinion Balfour had two
rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, becau&s;e he was a naval
officer, and held in &s;overeign contempt
the military buck; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e
it had a great deal of truth.</P>
<P>To Mi&s;s Million Emily now re&s;olved to
have recour&s;e as a patrone&s;s of her little
works. About one o'clock &s;he went to
that lady, whom &s;he found at breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>When Emily entered, &s;he experienced
great difficulty in making her&s;elf known.
She was Mi&s;s Balfour, of Exmouth&mdash;She
had had the honour of Mi&s;s Million's
vi&s;its&mdash;She had not forgotten Mi&s;s Mil|lion's
invitation&mdash;She he&s;itated, &s;tood
&s;ilent, and perplexed.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="296">
Mi&s;s Million &s;tared, and then cried&mdash;&startq;The
old blind lieutenant's daughter!
Lord, my dear, I never expected to &s;ee you
in town. I declare I feel my&s;elf delighted.
Won't you take a chair? And are you
&s;ettled in London? And where do you
live? What has brought you to town?
And who do you vi&s;it in our neighbour|hood?&endq;</P>
<P>All the&s;e que&s;tions were extremely em|barra&s;&s;ing,
and the la&s;t &s;eemed vexatious.
Emily, confu&s;ed, and knowing not which
particular one to &s;elect from the number,
&s;at &s;ilently down. As it happened, &s;he
did what preci&s;ely &s;he would have done
had &s;he been more intimately acquainted
with this fa&s;hionable lady; who was one
of tho&s;e per&s;ons who, when they put
que&s;tions, do not exactly know the nature
of a point of interrogation, and therefore
neither wait for nor expect an an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="297">
To relieve her&s;elf from all the&s;e per|plexities,
Emily re&s;olved to tell her &s;tory
in her own way.</P>
<P>&startq;I have done my&s;elf the plea&s;ure (&s;he
began) of waiting on you, becau&s;e you
can, I think, madam, render me an im|portant
&s;ervice &s;hould I merit your at|tentions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;An important &s;ervice,&endq; muttered
Mi&s;s Million, looking much more gravely
than &s;he did when &s;he was putting her
rapid que&s;tions. Indeed &s;he had good
rea&s;on, for the words, &startq;important &s;er|vice,&endq;
conveyed to her brain a kind of
half-reflection, which always di&s;turbs the
intellectual faculties of a lady of great
fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>&startq;My father (continued Emily) died
la&s;t week in this town. You know, ma|dam,
that a half-pay officer cannot die
rich, yet he may die with honour. My
father has not encumbered his orphan
<PB N="275" REF="298">
daughter with a &s;ingle debt. I am now
obliged to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e talents
which once formed my amu&s;ements. You
have honoured them, madam, with your
partial approbation. I &s;hall &s;oon have
&s;ome little paintings, and &s;ome pieces of
lace, which, if recommended by your pa|tronage,
will procure me an employment
and a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.&endq; She &s;topt, and a few
minutes of &s;ilence took place.</P>
<P>&startq;Oh child, is that all?&endq; replied Mi&s;s
Million, with her eye fixed on a print
that was placed oppo&s;ite. &startq;Have you
brought any with you? Lady Belfield is
a great collector and amateur. I &s;hall
certainly recommend you, child!&endq; Mi&s;s
Million &s;poke all this with that refined
apathy which &s;eems to be a gift from
nature rather than an acqui&s;ition of art.
It was expre&s;&s;ed in that tone of indif|ference
which ladies of her fa&s;hion em|ploy
whenever an object of charity has
<PB N="276" REF="299">
by &s;ome means got introduced mi&s;takenly
into their apartments; a mi&s;take which
they generally afterwards provide again&s;t.</P>
<P>Emily knew nothing of all this; &s;he
only did not find her&s;elf quite &s;o com|fortable
as &s;he had fondly hoped.</P>
<P>As Mi&s;s Million recollected that &startq;the
important &s;ervice&endq; would not occa&s;ion
any exertion, and as &startq;the old blind
lieutenant's daughter,&endq; after all, made no
attack, direct or oblique, on her pur&s;e,
&s;he mo&s;t humanely conde&s;cended to give
Emily&mdash;a very detailed account of
Mrs. Broadhead's ma&s;querade, in which
&s;he had exhibited her&s;elf, and the queen
of France's necklace, in the character of
Britannia.</P>
<P>Suddenly, however, a great change was
ob&s;ervable in this amiable woman. Her
tones were tolerably gentle, her counte|nance
looked almo&s;t with tenderne&s;s, and
&s;oftly pre&s;&s;ing Emily's hand, &s;he &s;aid,
&startq;My dear Mi&s;s Balfour, how I &s;ympathi&s;e
<PB N="277" REF="300">
with you! Your father was a dear good
man, and behaved to me with extreme
politene&s;s; and a&s;&s;uredly your accom|pli&s;hments
well merit a friend. You are
&s;olitary in a dangerous town; I wi&s;h, my
dear, you would accept an a&s;ylum in
Portman Square. Your company would
be a great relief to my &s;pirits. Lord, my
dear! you can't conceive what a poor
nervous being I have grown! Such head|achs
of a morning! &s;uch tremors la&s;t
night at the ma&s;querade, when my neck|lace
hung rather loo&s;e! I am quite in
rapture to &s;ee you, and I in&s;i&s;t on your
making this place your abode.&endq;</P>
<P>Emily was con&s;oled for what &s;he had
&s;uffered. The invitation was a benefit
&s;he could not re&s;i&s;t; it at once relieved
her from parting with Mrs. Wil&s;on in
apparent di&s;plea&s;ure, and it &s;ecured her
from the precarious mode of life &s;he pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="278" REF="301">
to adopt. She acceded to the pro|po&s;al
of Mi&s;s Million. This was the
fir&s;t error &s;he committed in her entrance
into the world; but &s;he was not aware
that &s;he was then violating the &s;olemn
injunction of her father, to &s;eek her inde|pendence
only in her&s;elf.</P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible, in clo&s;ing this chapter,
that &s;ome of our readers (for &s;uch a&s;&s;ur|edly
we &s;hall be mortified with) who&s;e
&s;agacity is of the rapid kind, and who
judge, we &s;uppo&s;e, by intuition, have al|ready
condemned us as having commit|ted
an outrage on venerable nature when
we repre&s;ented Mi&s;s Million &s;o &s;uddenly
differing from her&s;elf in her ge&s;tures, her
voice, and her expre&s;&s;ions. If we are
here condemned by any ra&s;h judge, who
chu&s;es to &s;it on the bench, we &s;hall ab|&s;olutely
move for a new trial before a
judge who can alone form the legal de|cree,
<PB N="279" REF="302">
we mean Rea&s;on, who a very great
poet has called,
<Q>&startq;The lord-chief ju&s;tice in the court of man.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>We do further declare, and hurl the
declaration in the very teeth of critici&s;m,
that we have not in this in&s;tance &s;werved
a &s;ingle hair's breadth from the curved
and involved line of human nature, which
we as much re&s;pect as did Hogarth when
he called it the line of beauty. A lady of
Mi&s;s Million's character, or no character
(as the reader chu&s;es) has frequent occa|&s;ions
to employ the&s;e fluctuations, de|pre&s;&s;ions,
and elevations of her voice and
countenance. What induced Mi&s;s Mil|lion
to differ &s;o very evidently from her|&s;elf
in the &s;hort &s;pace of a quarter of an
hour, we, for the ea&s;e of our candid rea|der,
mo&s;t willingly inform him.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be known, that Mi&s;s
Million had every thing a lady of qua|lity
<PB N="280" REF="303">
has, down to a lap dog and a &s;oci|able<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This &s;oleci&s;m in the Engli&s;h language is a barbarous &s;ub&s;tantive of the polite circles.

termed a humble companion. Mi&s;s Mil|lion
was, as we have &s;een, rather new on
the town, and di&s;dained to bring any
&startq;low creature&endq; from Pudding Lane to
Portman Square. She was on the point
of adverti&s;ing for &s;ome &s;uch &s;ervant out
of place, when, providentially, poor Emily
Balfour appeared. The thought did not
occur immediately, but merely when
the vi&s;ible alteration took place. In a
word, the very compa&s;&s;ionate Mi&s;s Mil|lion
propo&s;ed to make the &s;ame u&s;e of
our amiable heroine as &s;ome &s;till do of a
dumb waiter&mdash;an excellent piece of fur|niture
when a per&s;on happens to be quite
alone.</P>

<P>EMILY, on her return to Mrs. Wil&s;on,
acquainted her with her unexpected
good fortune, felt every gratitude for her,
but propo&s;ed the following day for her
removal. Mrs. Wil&s;on li&s;tened in &s;ilence,
and even after Emily had cea&s;ed to &s;peak,
could only an&s;wer by a profound &s;igh.
At length &s;he &s;aid, &startq;This &s;eparation is
&s;evere as it is &s;udden. Your ab&s;ence
includes the lo&s;s of &s;o many tender ideas,
&s;o much con&s;olation, &s;o &s;weet a tranquil|lity,
and &s;uch numerous and gentle offices!
I know that I am not worthy of enjoying
<PB N="282" REF="305">
a friend&s;hip like yours; but once to have
called &s;uch excellence my own rai&s;es me
in my own e&s;timation. The pride I feel
but gives a &s;harper pang to this laceration
of my affections. I had bu&s;ied my
thoughts in forming an ea&s;y e&s;tabli&s;hment
for you; but it is now over! Allow me,
however, my dear Mi&s;s Emily, when you
are quite &s;ettled, to call once on you.
Let me have at lea&s;t the con&s;olation of
knowing that you feel your &s;ituation
agreeable.&endq; &startq;My dear Mrs. Wil&s;on,&endq;
replied Emily, pre&s;&s;ing her hand, while a
tear dropt from her eye, &startq;I can never for|get
you. Superior to your occupation, I
lament to leave you in it. You was my
fir&s;t friend in this great town; perhaps
the only one I now po&s;&s;e&s;s. Call on me
whenever you chu&s;e; I &s;hall certainly
call frequently on you.&endq; Emily thought
to her&s;elf &startq;what a delicate circum&s;tance!
<PB N="283" REF="306">
I feel grateful, yet mu&s;t not evince gra|titude!&endq;</P>
<P>Emily on the following day removed
to Portman Square. She was received
with exce&s;&s;ive and trouble&s;ome kindne&s;s
by Mi&s;s Million. She allotted her an
apartment, furni&s;hed her with a lady's
maid, and gave many other proofs that
her genero&s;ity was as inexhau&s;tible as her
wealth. Emily received every thing with
a favourable eye and a grateful heart.
She indeed would have wi&s;hed to have
been le&s;s incommoded by this multipli|city
of grandeur, but &s;he &s;uffered it from
affection for the donor; nor did it much
di&s;concert her, for &s;he was educated to
give dignity to the grandeur of an oriental
prince&s;s.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now leave Emily amid&s;t all
the &s;plendors of Mi&s;s Million, arrang|ing
her little affairs, preparing various
implements of ta&s;te, with which &s;he pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="284" REF="307">
adorning the &s;tately man&s;ion in
Portman Square; &s;ometimes attuning
her harp, and by her attitude and har|mony
exhibiting a per&s;onification of that
&s;aint of ta&s;te, Cecilia; nor did &s;he te&s;tify
an inferior affection for &s;ome things
which &s;he never propo&s;ed to exhibit in
public; we mean certain loo&s;e papers,
which book&s;ellers term manu&s;cripts; for
(which we have not hitherto even hinted
to our readers, as we re&s;olved they &s;hould
get her character by degrees) Emily, al|mo&s;t
unknown to every one, and parti|cularly
to her&s;elf, was a delightful and
feeling poete&s;s. She pre&s;umed not to
print her ver&s;es, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;en&s;i|ble
they were quite of another character
from that mo&s;t ornamented, mo&s;t elabo|rate,
mo&s;t offu&s;cating manner of our
fa&s;hionable children of Apollo. All that
we can permit our&s;elves to &s;ay on &s;o
&s;ecret and delicate a &s;ubject as the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="285" REF="308">
is, that &s;he never read Milton but
that &s;he &s;eemed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his own imagi|nation,
if we might judge by the agita|tion
of her frame; and her couplets were
formed on the fini&s;hed &s;tructure of Pope's
opulent yet not gaudy ver&s;ification; and
we are inclined to think, that through
the high poli&s;h of his ver&s;e there ran a
vein of the Italian fancy of her favourite
Milton. There &s;eemed, indeed, a &s;pecies
of plagiari&s;m in her poetical talent, &s;ince,
whenever &s;he ro&s;e from a peru&s;al of &s;ome
of the great ma&s;ters in her beloved art,
and had employed her active fancy in
the &s;ublime and beautiful, as certainly
would &s;he pour out &s;ome effu&s;ions of a
congenial nature; but as the&s;e were only
effu&s;ions of the moment, Emily had
written a great deal of ver&s;e without
having compo&s;ed one poem, or &s;u&s;pecting
her&s;elf of being a poete&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="309">
During the time we have been de|&s;cribing,
Charles and Vaurien had rather
more frequently than heretofore called
on Mrs. Wil&s;on, never omitting enqui|ries
after her fair lodger, who &s;ince the
death of her father was quite invi&s;ible,
and never quitted her apartment. Mrs.
Wil&s;on now informed them, that to her
great regret &s;he had left her apartments
to re&s;ide with Mi&s;s Million, in Portman
Square.</P>
<P>&startq;Charles (&s;aid Vaurien) that is the
ugly huge corpulent daughter of the
loan contractor, who begged us to call
on him to give our opinion of an im|men&s;e
villa he is building. What think
you of a call? The wor&s;t is, that if we
&s;ee Mi&s;s Balfour we mu&s;t &s;ee Mi&s;s Mil|lion,
which is like pa&s;&s;ing through pur|gatory
to get to heaven.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I remember (&s;aid Charles) that Mr.
Million at the routes of Lady Belfield.
<PB N="287" REF="310">
That man always offends me by his o&s;ten|tatious
wealth; he carries his &s;chedule in
his mouth, and &s;eems to be talking to
his &s;teward when he is conver&s;ing with a
friend. Then we &s;hall be perplexed with
all the fluctuations of &s;tocks, and pro|bably
have a mo&s;t true and faithful ac|count
of his interview with Mr. Pitt
about the lottery contract. However
we mu&s;t go, Vaurien, will he, nill he,
for the &s;ake of &s;omething more precious
than even his la&s;t loan.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>De par tous les diables,</HI> Charles! I
&s;ee clearly you are &s;mitten with this girl.
Upon my &s;oul &s;he is worth enjoying; you
are in love, my boy!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed I am not, Mr. Vaurien; I
give you my honour I am not. I never
intend to be in love; a young man like
me cannot afford it. It is one of the
attendant cur&s;es of a luxurious age, Vau|rien,
that it &s;evers all tho&s;e finer affec|tions
<PB N="288" REF="311">
of the heart, without which there
is no true plea&s;ure in exi&s;tence. We
do not marry tho&s;e whom we could love
becau&s;e they are poor; and we marry
tho&s;e whom we can never love, becau&s;e
they are rich. O what a formal, feeble,
frigid Cupid is our modern deity of love!
he has no quiver filled with thrilling darts,
no unerring bow, none of the naked mo|de&s;ty
of the child of beauty; on he trudges
with a black coat, with voluminous parch|ments,
and the only language he whi&s;|pers
agreeable to a woman's ear, is jointure
and &s;ettlement. My friend, I have re|&s;olved
never to render my&s;elf or another
mi&s;erable by matrimony.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A mo&s;t wi&s;e and generous re&s;olution!
A man need not want for wives in the
pre&s;ent day; tho&s;e of his neighbours are
quite his own, if he only knows how to
knock at the door. The noble work of
propagation thrives not the wor&s;e; 'tis
<PB N="289" REF="312">
only a&s;&s;i&s;ting the lame over a &s;tile, Charles!
modern matrimony is one va&s;t &s;y&s;tem of
polygamy. Why, matrimony was a blun|der
of &s;ome &s;tupid and impotent legi&s;la|tor;
nothing can be more unnatural than
to cork up in one bottle elements that can
never blend; marriage! mere oil and
vinegar; one of them will always remain
under; in France we have therefore
e&s;tabli&s;hed divorces at the plea&s;ure of
either party. I knew a young Hercules
who had thirty wives in the fir&s;t year
after the committee of public &s;afety
had decreed it: poor fellow, he was un|lucky;
for, like Hercules, he died of the en|venomed
robe of one of his Dejaniras. But
why need we public divorces, when, with|out
the formality, we live in a cour&s;e of
marriage and divorce.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Vaurien, this &s;ubject is always
revolting to me; you treat it like a
Frenchman, and never in your country
<PB N="290" REF="313">
was true connubial enjoyment found.
Adultery is foul; not becau&s;e the law
has &s;o decreed it, but becau&s;e rea&s;on
tells me this. Adultery takes away from
a hu&s;band the love that was the &s;ource
of his exi&s;tence; from children, the ma|ternal
affection that re-enjoyed the father
in his offspring; from dome&s;tics, the re|&s;pect
that they felt for their mi&s;tre&s;s, and
inflames a woman with &s;alacious pa&s;&s;ions,
who, when &s;he hurries reeking from the
&s;tews, is more mi&s;erable than the com|mon
pro&s;titute, becau&s;e &s;he is not as com|mon.
O Vaurien, 'tis a foul crime; the
cruelty of murder terminates in one per|&s;on,
the cruelty of adultery is propa|gated
through a generation.&endq;</P>
<P>In this dull morali&s;ing &s;train (at lea&s;t
on the &s;ide of Charles) they reached Mr.
Million's hou&s;e; and that day being a

was at home.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="314">

half on the con&s;ols. The fir&s;t Engli&s;h
financier; he &s;aves the nation from ruin
by the harde&s;t Smithfield bargain. But
&s;ince lords have become bankers I think
the banking bu&s;ine&s;s degenerates.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="317">
&startq;We have come, Mr. Million, to &s;ee
the plan of your &s;uperb villa.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Aye, I have begun to build; but
'twill take ten years before I can get into
an apartment. 'Tis long for a man of
&s;ixty! 'Tis a pity that your grand &s;tyle
is always the longe&s;t to manage. My
country hou&s;e will be as large and
&s;olid as the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e; I'm all for
&s;olidity. It will exhau&s;t a mine of Port|land
&s;tone, and will &s;tand, I am told,
in an earthquake. My drawing rooms
are to be papered with &s;ilver mu&s;lin; that
is, they will not be papered at all.
One's obliged to u&s;e old words for new
fa&s;hions, which &s;ometimes confu&s;es our
ideas. My gardens will take up, includ|ing
plea&s;ure grounds, offschapes, and
land&s;capes, above one hundred acres. I
have cut a red-hot gravel coach-road all
through it for the convenience of travel|ling
at home. My hot-hou&s;es are im|men&s;e,
and my pigs &s;hall feed on pines.
<PB N="295" REF="318">
I have got the New River turned into my
garden as a fi&s;h-pond, but it looks like a
puddle. I am fond of &s;eeing hou&s;es, hav|ing
been born in a very narrow lane; and
there is &s;omething too more natural in a
hou&s;e than a tree, for it always &s;hews
there mu&s;t be people near one. I prefer
the view of a &s;ociable wall, and even the
gutter of a neighbour's hou&s;e, to all that
mad jaunt in Devon&s;hire, riding po&s;t over
hill and valley till I was &s;ea-&s;ick; 'tis
an abominable romantic country! So I
have planned an ornament, which no one
ever thought of; in the mid&s;t of my
immen&s;e garden I &s;hall build a row of
&s;mall hou&s;es. I &s;hall call it Million Row,
at Million Place. I have no trees in my
grounds but poplars; for a man of my
age they are the only trees; they &s;pring
the quicke&s;t. A tall poplar, &s;tiff as
this rule in my hand, regales my eye; it
is the Pitt of trees; I call &s;uch the
&s;traight lines of nature. I have a &s;um|mer-hou&s;e,
<PB N="296" REF="319">
in the exact form of the cu|pola
at the Bank, &s;o exact that you would
&s;wear you &s;tood in it. On the walls are
de&s;igned all the Bank offices; here the
three per cents, there the &s;hort annuities,
ju&s;t as they are. The figures at their
various de&s;ks are portraits of my intimate
friends. Pitt is &s;eated in the director's
chair. A curious gallery of pictures!
My daughter wanted me to have a ma&s;|querade
&s;cene painted, with portraits of <HI>her</HI>
friends; but <HI>her</HI> friends all wear ma&s;ks.
So then the arti&s;t ob&s;erved, that they
might be painted, as he &s;aid &s;aints who
had lo&s;t their heads generally were, that
is, by holding their heads in their hands,
like chapeaux bas, under their arms. Did
you ever hear the like? No, no, I pre|ferred
<HI>my</HI> friends, who are not a&s;hamed to
&s;hew their faces, and have heads on their
&s;houlders; for there's not a man of them
worth le&s;s than half a million. D&mdash;e if I
would form a friend&s;hip with any man
<PB N="297" REF="320">
who is not worth a hundred thou&s;and.
'Tis a maxim!&endq;</P>
<P>At this moment a &s;ervant entered, and
informed Mr. Million, that Bob was in a
delirium.</P>
<P>Million exclaimed, wringing his hands,
&startq;In a delirium! The wor&s;t news I have
heard &s;ince the &s;udden peace! Run, fetch
the prince's phy&s;ician, the great city doc|tor&mdash;the
quaker and the Jew&mdash;a con&s;ulta|tion
in&s;tantly. What, Bob in a delirium!
This comes of his high feeding.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who is Bob, Mr. Million,&endq; enquired
Charles, &startq;you have no &s;on, or nephew, or
cou&s;in of that name?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Bob, &s;ir, was one of my ploughboys;
gentlemen! a youth &s;trong as his team of
hor&s;es. Who the devil could think &s;uch
a hor&s;e of a man could ever be deli|rious!&endq;</P>
<P>Charles exclaimed, &startq;How &s;en&s;itive is this
humanity at the di&s;order of his plough|boy.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="321">
Vaurien &s;aid, turning to Charles, &startq;I
wonder at the rea&s;on?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Gentlemen, (continued Million) I
feel my&s;elf &s;uddenly indi&s;po&s;ed. Poor
Bob! I received him in my hou&s;e, fur|ni&s;hed
him with all the requi&s;ites of a
gentleman, and de&s;ired him to live well;
bought turtles on the fir&s;t arrivals of the
We&s;t India fleet; the dog &s;willed a pipe
of Madeira in &s;ix months. What could
man do more? he looked jolly and com|fortable,
and as red in the face as a
burning coal. Poor Bob! I fear I overfed
him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t know the rea&s;on,&endq; &s;aid Vau|rien,
earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>&startq;He mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly (&s;aid Charles) have
performed &s;ome great and good action,
Mr. Million, to have merited affections &s;o
truely paternal.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Gentlemen (replied Million) he is
the complete&s;t &s;coundrel, and only e&s;|caped
hanging by my intere&s;t with the
<PB N="299" REF="322">
mini&s;ter. A mo&s;t per&s;evering thief, a
mo&s;t dauntle&s;s liar, and a mo&s;t univer&s;al
ravi&s;her. He has ba&s;tardi&s;ed a pari&s;h.
But the fellow was the mo&s;t athletic and
brawny &s;coundrel in the three kingdoms;
a perfect iron giant; a fellow who in his
loo&s;e days, before he lived with me, when
'twas thought he could not e&s;cape the
gallows, every great &s;urgeon in town
kept an eye on. Providence, indeed,
ble&s;t the &s;coundrel with a mo&s;t uninter|rupted
&s;tate of health, and excepting the
year after he dome&s;ticated with me, had
never the &s;lighte&s;t ail.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will know the rea&s;on,&endq; &s;aid Vaurien.
&startq;And pray, &s;ir, why did you throw away
&s;uch exce&s;&s;ive indulgences on a man
who has defrauded the gibbet?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Throw away, &s;ir, who the devil
could think of a delirium? I con&s;idered
he was a &s;afer per&s;on than my&s;elf, a poor
tottering old man, and my daughter
of a plethoric habit, and with &s;uch ex|qui&s;ite
<PB N="300" REF="323">
&s;en&s;ibility that &s;he is liable to a
dozen hy&s;terics a day.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Safe in what, &s;ir?&endq; demanded Charles.</P>
<P>&startq;Why have I not already informed
you? Gentlemen, I have both a tontine
and an annuity on the &s;coundrel's life.
If he dies I lo&s;e three thou&s;and a year. I
might have in&s;ured his life, but his appe|tite
was &s;o voracious and regular, his
cheeks &s;o round and ro&s;y, a very Fal&s;taff
without &s;tuffing! On trufle pa&s;ties and
perigord pies he would breakfa&s;t, dine,
and &s;up, with intermediate refre&s;hments.
I cou'd'nt believe it, but the apothecary
&s;aid that his blood was one ma&s;s of in|flammation.
Gentlemen, I mu&s;t beg
leave to retire. I mu&s;t &s;ee how the &s;coun|drel
does. The Lord pre&s;erve his precious
life. Overgorged by G&mdash;!&endq;</P>
<P>This accident broke the purport of the
vi&s;it. &startq;We mu&s;t return again (&s;aid
Vaurien) when Bob is quite recovered or
quite dead.&endq;</P>
