<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Diary is printed from a manu&s;cript of the late Lord Melcombe's, and as the reader may be inqui&s;itive to know the &s;tages, through which it came into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall briefly &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Lord Melcombe died in the year 1762, and bequeathed his whole property, (a few legacies excepted) to his cou&s;in, the late Thomas Wyndham of Hammer&s;mith.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Wyndham, who died in the year 1777, left, among many other kind remembrances, a clau&s;e in his will in the following words "I give to Henry Pen|ruddocke Wyndham all my books, and all the late Lord Melcombe's political papers, letters, and poems, reque&s;ting of him not to print or publi&s;h any of them, but tho&s;e
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
that are proper to be made publick, and &s;uch only, as may, in &s;ome degree, do honour to his memory."</P>
<P>The latter part of this clau&s;e has, hitherto, made me he&s;itate on the propriety of making his Lord&s;hip's Diary publick; for although it may reflect a con&s;iderable degree of ho|nour on his Lord&s;hip's abilities, yet, in my opinion, it &s;hews his political conduct, (however palliated by the ingenuity of his own pen) to have been wholly directed by the ba&s;e motives of avarice, vanity, and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>What, be&s;ide the&s;e motives, induced him to quit the &s;ervice of George II. and to prefer the protection of Frederick, Prince of Wales, to that of his old ma&s;ter? alas! he could not then fore&s;ee the black cloud, which was preparing to ob&s;cure the ex|pected glory of the ri&s;ing &s;un, and to bla&s;t the hopes of all its wor&s;hippers.</P>
<P>What, be&s;ide the&s;e motives, made his Lord&s;hip di&s;contented and mi&s;erable, while
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
he remained in the court of that Prince? a party was, there, quickly combined again&s;t him, which, unfortunately for Lord Mel|combe, was actuated by the &s;ame &s;elfi&s;h principles, as he him&s;elf was.</P>
<P>What, be&s;ide the&s;e motives, tempted him, after the death of the Prince of Wales, to court the Pelhams with the mo&s;t abject and fawning &s;ervility, and, at the &s;ame time, in &s;ecret oppo&s;ition to his great patrone&s;s, the Prince&s;s Dowager?</P>
<P>But all this may be &s;trictly honourable within the verge of a court; and, on this account, I could patiently hear his Lord|&s;hip recommend Mr. Ralph, as a very hone&s;t man, and in the &s;ame pages inform us, that he was ready to be hired to any cau&s;e; that he actually put him&s;elf to auction to the two contending parties (the Bedford and Pelhams) and that, after &s;everal bid|dings, the <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Mr. Ralph was bought by the Pelhams.</P>
<P>However, I cannot patiently forgive the
<PB N="x" REF="7">
violent declamation of his Lord&s;hip again&s;t "<HI>the low and venal wretches of Bridgewater</HI>;" as if a bribe, taken by a mi&s;erable voter, and, po&s;&s;ibly, for the &s;upport of a nume|rous and indigent family, was more di&s;|honourable, than a place or pen&s;ion, en|joyed or coveted by the opulent, for the &s;ole purpo&s;es, either of accumulating riches, or of extending the pomp of pride and power.</P>
<P>I am aware that, in treating the cha|racter of my Author thus freely, I &s;hall appear as a very extraordinary Editor, the practice of whom has generally been, to prefer flattery to truth, and partiality to ju&s;tice. But it may be worth con&s;idering, whether my method or the common one is the le&s;s injurious to the character of an Author; and whether the reader may not be more inclined to overlook or pardon tho&s;e errors, which he is previou&s;ly in|&s;tructed to expect, than he would be, if every page contradicted the favourable im|pre&s;&s;ions, which the Editor had been in|du&s;triou&s;ly labouring to fix on his mind.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="8">But it is now time to an&s;wer a very na|tural que&s;tion, how could I, with &s;uch &s;entiments of the Diary, venture to pub|li&s;h it, con&s;i&s;tent with the clau&s;e in the will?</P>
<P>To what I have &s;aid before, that the Diary was written by Lord Melcombe, I &s;hall add, that every part of it was care|fully copied from rough drafts, and that &s;carcely a blot or correction is to be &s;een throughout the whole. The month al&s;o, and each day of the week, is accurately in&s;cribed on the margin, with his own pen, in printing characters.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances I conclude, that Lord Melcombe wrote for the public, and that he intended his Diary &s;hould, in a future &s;ea&s;on, be produced to light: it is al&s;o manife&s;t, that his Lord&s;hip meant it as an apology for his political conduct, and that he could not write it merely for amu&s;ement, or &s;olely for his own retro&s;|pection, or for the private peru&s;al only of his heirs.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="9">The late Mr. Wyndham, through who&s;e hands the MS. came to me, was of this opinion.</P>
<P>It &s;eems therefore that, in publi&s;hing this Diary, I am certainly fulfilling Lord Melcombe's de&s;ign, and doing what he anticipated &s;ome one or other &s;hould do; it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that, in his opinion, there is nothing di&s;honourable in the Diary, and to his judgment I am in duty bound to &s;acrifice my own: the prejudices, perhaps, of education have in&s;tilled in my mind ideas of honour, very different from tho&s;e of his Lord&s;hip, which &mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash; putavi</L>
<L>Stultus ego huic no&s;trae &s;imiles&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding, if I thought that any part of the Diary would tend to make one worthy character unhappy, or cau&s;e the &s;malle&s;t injury to the common good, I &s;hould, without he&s;itation, &s;uppre&s;s it: nay, I would in&s;tantly commit it to the flames, le&s;t it might hereafter be productive of tho&s;e con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="10">If, on the contrary, by unveiling the my&s;terious intrigues of a court, and by expo&s;ing the latent cau&s;es of oppo&s;ition, the Diary teaches us, that both one and the other may act from the &s;ame intere&s;ted and corrupt principle; it may then make us cautiou&s;ly diffident of the motives of either, and the country gentlemen, in particular, may learn from it, that they have as much to dread from tho&s;e, who are in pur&s;uit of power, as from tho&s;e in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; from tho&s;e, who are, hopefully, working in the cold climate of di&s;appoint|ment, as from tho&s;e, who are luxuriou&s;ly ba&s;king in the &s;un&s;hine of enjoyment.</P>
<P>The Diary may even animate tho&s;e gentle|men to the love of true patrioti&s;m, and, pro|bably, in&s;truct them to be more attentive to the <HI>mea&s;ures</HI> of Admini&s;tration, than to the <HI>parties</HI> which form it; and may check and controul that re&s;tle&s;s aver&s;ion to all goverment, &s;o prevalent among&s;t them, and again&s;t which, the be&s;t Mini&s;ter is no more &s;ecure than the wor&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="11">For have we not &s;ometimes &s;een? when, after a long and laborious &s;truggle, they have at length placed their favourite pilot at the helm; that, before they have &s;uffered him to hold the rudder for one voyage, they have been as violent in their efforts of removing him, as they had been in rai&s;|ing him to it?</P>
<P>I think it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that I have not publi&s;hed the Diary quite entire, as it would be no entertainment to the reader to be informed, who daily dined with his Lord&s;hip, or whom he met at the tables of other people.</P>
<P>Such and &s;ome other trivial particulars I have omitted, but I have been careful not to alter any part of the original writ|ing, for, though &s;ome ob&s;curities darken a few pa&s;&s;ages (which, indeed, might na|turally be expected from his Lord&s;hip's circum&s;tantial manner of reciting long conver&s;ations) yet, I have not pre&s;umed
<PB N="xv" REF="12">
to give them my explanation, being of opinion that the reader has an equal right, with my&s;elf, to put his own con&s;truction upon them.</P>
<P>Some trifling anecdotes, however, may &s;till appear in the pre&s;ent volume, &s;uch as the di&s;putes of the Dor&s;et family; the Bridgewater, and other elections, &amp;c. but the&s;e are &s;o interwoven and connected with the general matter, and &s;o often referred to, that I could not, with pro|priety, reject them, le&s;t the whole might, otherwi&s;e, &s;eem embarra&s;&s;ed and unintelligible.</P>

<HEAD>THE DIARY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of this year, I was<MILESTONE N="1749."> grievou&s;ly afflicted with the fir&s;t fit of the gout, which, with a fall that &s;trained one leg and wounded the other, confined me to my chamber near three months.</P>
<P>During my illne&s;s, &s;everal kind expre&s;|&s;ions from the Prince towards me, were reported to me, and on the 8th of March,<MILESTONE N="8." UNIT="Mar."> his Royal Highne&s;s ordered the Earl of Middle&s;ex, his Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, to &s;end Mr. Ralph (whom he had often talked to about me) with a me&s;&s;age from his Royal Highne&s;s, to offer me the full return of his favour, and to put the principal direction of his affairs into my hands.</P>
<P>I told Mr. Ralph, that I de&s;ired the two following days to con&s;ider of it; and
<PB N="2" REF="14">
that he &s;hould have my an&s;wer at twelve o'clock, on Saturday the 11th in&s;tant.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Mar.">This day in the morning I wrote to Mr. Pelham, de&s;iring him, as I was not able to go out, to wait upon the King, and in my name humbly to re&s;ign, into his Maje&s;ty's hands, my office of Trea&s;urer of the Navy.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day I gave Mr. Ralph my an&s;wer in writing to the Prince's gracious me&s;&s;age, to be delivered to the Earl of Middle&s;ex, taking his honour, that he would lay it before his Royal Highne&s;s, which Mr. Ralph performed, as did al&s;o his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The &s;ame morning, I received a very civil letter from Mr. Pelham, te&s;tifying his concern and &s;urprize at my re&s;olution, and de&s;iring that he might &s;ee me, before he delivered my me&s;&s;age to the King, and ac|quainting me, that he would come to me on Monday the 13th in the morning, be|fore
<PB N="3" REF="15">
he went to court, being then ju&s;t go|ing into the country.</P>
<P>This day early in the morning, Mr.<MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="Mar."> Pelham made me a long vi&s;it with much ci|vility, he &s;eemed to wi&s;h much that this af|fair might go no farther. I told him that I &s;aw the country in &s;o dangerous a condi|tion, and found my&s;elf &s;o incapable to con|tribute to its relief and &s;o unwelcome to attempt it; that I thought it mi&s;became me any longer to receive great emoluments from a country, who&s;e &s;ervice I could not, and if I could, I &s;hould not be &s;uffered to promote: &s;o I begged him to execute my commi&s;&s;ion to the King, and then we parted.</P>
<P>He came to me again, about eleven o'clock, to let me know that the King ac|cepted my re&s;ignation very graciou&s;ly, but expected that I would continue to act, till he could fix upon a proper &s;ucce&s;&s;or. I did &s;o, and was continued in the office till the 3d of May.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="16">The Prince was extremely kind to me, <MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="July">and often admitted me to the honour of &s;upping with him and the Prince&s;s. But on Saturday the 16th of July, going to Carleton Hou&s;e, to make my compliments before I went to Ea&s;tbury, he ordered me to &s;up with him, and invited me to &s;pend the day with him, at Kew, on the following Tue&s;day, being the 18th, want|ing, as he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, to talk to me about bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="July">This day I arived at Kew about eleven o'clock. The Prince received me mo&s;t kindly, and told me he de&s;ired me to come into his &s;ervice upon any terms, and by any title I plea&s;ed: that he meant to put the principal direction of his affairs into my hands: and what he could not do for me in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, mu&s;t be made up to me in futurity. All this in a man|ner, &s;o noble and frank, and with expre&s;|&s;ions &s;o full of affection and regard, that I ought not to remember them, but as a debt, and to perpetuate my gratitude. This pa&s;&s;ed before dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="17">After dinner, he took me into a private room, and of him&s;elf began to &s;ay, that he thought I might as well be called Trea|&s;urer of the Chambers, as any other name: that the Earl of Scarborough, his Trea|&s;urer, might take it ill, if I &s;tood upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment with higher appointments than he did: that his Royal Highne&s;s's de&s;tination was, that I &s;hould have 2000<HI>l. per annum</HI>. That he thought it be&s;t to put me upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment at the highe&s;t &s;alary, only, and that he would pay me the re&s;t him&s;elf. I humbly de&s;ired, that I might &s;tand upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment without any &s;alary, and that I would take what he now de&s;igned for me, when he &s;hould be King, but nothing before. He &s;aid, that it became me, to make him that offer, but it did not become him to accept it, con&s;i&s;tent with his reputation, and therefore, it mu&s;t be in pre&s;ent. He then immediately added, that we mu&s;t &s;ettle what was to happen in rever&s;ion, and &s;aid, that he thought a Peerage with the management of the Hou&s;e of Lords, and the &s;eals of Secretary of State, for the
<PB N="6" REF="18">
Southern Province, would be a proper &s;tation for me, if I approved of it. Per|ceiving me to be under much confu&s;ion at this unexpected offer, and at a lo&s;s how to expre&s;s my&s;elf; he &s;topped me, and then &s;aid, I now promi&s;e you on the word and honour of a Prince, that, as &s;oon as I come to the Crown, I will give you a Peerage and the Seals of the Southern Province. Upon my endeavouring to thank him, he repeated the &s;ame words, and added (putting back his chair) and I give you leave to ki&s;s my hand upon it, now, by way of acceptance, which I did accordingly.</P>
<P>He then continued to &s;ay, that he would provide for my friends, whom he knew I valued more than my&s;elf: that he pro|mi&s;ed Mr. Furne&s;e, the Trea&s;ury: Sir Francis Da&s;hwood, the Trea&s;ury of the Navy, or Cofferrer: Mr. Henley, Solicitor General, and gave me leave to tell them &s;o, adding, that he would confirm it to them him&s;elf. Lord Talbot I was to &s;ettle with, when I &s;aw him in Dor&s;et&s;hire. We agreed,
<PB N="7" REF="19">
that he &s;hould &s;end for me to Cliefden, when he was &s;ettled there, where the war|rant &s;hould be ordered, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon the conver&s;ation before dinner, I had taken the opportunity to beg the Prince&s;s's protection, who an&s;wered me in the mo&s;t obliging manner.</P>
<P>I &s;aw Mr. Furne&s;e and Mr. Ralph at<MILESTONE N="19." UNIT="July"> Hammer&s;mith, to whom I related all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and promi&s;ed Mr. Ralph, that he &s;hould be my Secretary, if I lived to have the Seals.</P>
<P>Went to Ea&s;tbury.<MILESTONE N="20." UNIT="July"></P>
<P>Lord Talbot came over to me at Ea&s;t|bury.<MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="July"> I acquainted him with this whole tran&s;action; he promi&s;ed to &s;upport me to the utmo&s;t, and to do the Prince all po&s;&s;ible &s;ervice: but would accept no re|ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir Francis Da&s;hwood and his Lady<MILESTONE N="31." UNIT="July"> came to Ea&s;tbury. I informed him al&s;o
<PB N="8" REF="20">
of all that had pa&s;&s;ed. He received, with much plea&s;ure, both what related to him|&s;elf and to me.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Aug.">Mr. Bance came to Ea&s;tbury, whom al&s;o I acquainted with all that had pa&s;&s;ed between the Prince and me, and offered him my endeavour to procure for him the rever&s;ion of the Remittances, or of the Board of Trade, if he had a mind to leave the city. He received my narrative with much plea&s;ure, and my offers with great kindne&s;s and affection; prote&s;ting that he had no wi&s;h, but to remain always my faithful friend and &s;ervant, and de&s;ired, nor would have, nothing. But upon my pre&s;&s;ing him, he &s;aid, that if it mu&s;t be &s;o, he &s;hould chu&s;e the Remittances, and to have the &s;ecret and government of the Bank, as what he thought, would render him mo&s;t u&s;eful to his friends; to which I agreed, and promi&s;ed to undertake the affair with the Prince.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="Sept.">I received the Prince's commands, by
<PB N="9" REF="21">
the Earl of Egmont, to attend him at Cliefden.</P>
<P>Lord Shafte&s;bury came this morning:<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Sept."> I opened part of the Prince's &s;cheme to him: he &s;eemed plea&s;ed and willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t; and thought he could an&s;wer for Lord Foley, and promi&s;ed to try him.</P>
<P>Returned to Gunner&s;bury.<MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="Sept."></P>
<P>Saw Mr. Ralph, and talked with him<MILESTONE N="12, 13." UNIT="Sept."> about Lord Egmont's acquainting Cary with the whole tran&s;action between him and me.</P>
<P>Went from Gunner&s;bury to Cliefden.<MILESTONE N="14." UNIT="Sept."> Well received by all the family. There were be&s;ides, the Earl of Bute and Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Willes.</P>
<P>Dined with their Royal Highne&s;&s;es at<MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Sept."> Park Place. Lord Chief Ju&s;tice went from thence to Henley.</P>
<P>Orders to Mr. Drax, by Lord Egmont,<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Sept."> to make out my warrant. Received an
<PB N="10" REF="22">
account that Lord Cobham died on Wed|ne&s;day the 13th.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="Sept.">The Prince and Lord Egmont went to Town from Cliefden. The Prince&s;s to Kew. They returned thither about nine. I met them at ten. Lord Bathur&s;t came to Cliefden in the morning, and from thence to Kew.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="21." UNIT="Sept.">Sir William Stanhope came to Cliefden.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="23." UNIT="Sept.">At A&s;hley. Sent an ode to the Prin|ce&s;s, with a letter, by her command.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="24." UNIT="Sept.">Received an an&s;wer from the Prince&s;s.</P>

The Prince pretty eager about oppo&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>Ki&s;&s;ed the King's hand at Ken&s;ing|ton.<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Oct."> Was civilly received. Wrote to Lady Middle&s;ex about what pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t night. Sent a &s;ervant to the Grange with a letter to Mr. Henley, and wrote to Mr. Waller.</P>
<P>Set out from London. Met an an&s;wer<MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="Oct."> from Mr. Henley; not &s;o full as I expect|ed. Lay at Sutton, and arrived at Ea&s;t|bury the following day.</P>
<P>Mr. Drax came to Ea&s;tbury; he &s;ays,<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Oct."> Lady Middle&s;ex is cunning and &s;illy, and warns me again&s;t her.</P>

His Royal Highne&s;s &s;aid, he had had three methods propo&s;ed to him: the fir&s;t was to let the pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters &s;ettle it, and then part with them and the Parliament. The &s;econd was, to di&s;mi&s;s four or five of the principals, but to vote the civil li&s;t before the Parliament was di&s;&s;olved. The third, (which he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, he thought was my opinion) was to di&s;mi&s;s the Par|liament immediately, to turn all tho&s;e out whom he did not de&s;ign to continue, and to throw him&s;elf upon the country, for a new Parliament, and a provi&s;ion for him&s;elf and family, which he de&s;ired &s;hould be only a clear annuity of 800,000<HI>l.</HI> giving back the duties to the Public, with whatever &s;urplus might attend it.

It was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and we were all, at la&s;t, of opinion, that the third propo&s;ition was the greate&s;t, mo&s;t popular and the be&s;t. His Royal Highne&s;s came heartily into it, gave us his hand, and made us take hands with each other to &s;tand by, and &s;upport it.

<P>I ki&s;&s;ed the Duke's hand. Saw the<MILESTONE N="13."

His Royal Highne&s;s took me into a window, told me that he had &s;ent Middle&s;ex to me, about the &s;eizing the Printer, &amp;c. What was to be done? and then without giving me time to an&s;wer, he ran out into rea&s;ons why nobody that belonged to him mu&s;t appear. I gently let him &s;ee that I thought other|wi&s;e, and in&s;inuated, whether, if Mr. Ralph &s;hould be taken up, it would not be pro|per that Lord Middle&s;ex and I &s;hould bail him: he &s;aid, by no means, and there|fore Ralph &s;hould be &s;poken to, that he might keep out of the way, &amp;c.

After much talk about this and that, and &s;ome idle accounts about the poll at Covent Garden, he made me &s;it by him, and ran into a long di&s;cour&s;e about the army, and then about the reduction of intere&s;t, and &s;o let him&s;elf into a di&s;cour&s;e about the nece&s;&s;ity

of &s;aying &s;omething upon tho&s;e things in Parliament, to feel pul&s;e, and keep the party together, &amp;c. all which was de&s;igned as an apology (in&s;tead of finding fault) to me, for what had pa&s;&s;ed the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;I took it up, upon his men|tioning &s;omething about talk and throwing things out, to expo&s;e, &amp;c. and &s;aid that I &s;uppo&s;ed talk might be right, but people &s;hould con&s;ider what talk, and if they had any thing to &s;ay. That perpetually throwing out things, which one neither under&s;tood nor could prove, was, I thought, and always &s;hould think, expo&s;ing one's &s;elf, and not the per&s;ons aimed at&mdash;That 'twas for his &s;ervice, to put little things into his power, to be verified beyond contradiction; that he might certainly know what dependance was to be had upon tho&s;e they came from, when they inform|ed him of greater matters. Therefore, I would furni&s;h him with one in&s;tance; he had heard I was in a great pa&s;&s;ion about the Earl of Egmont's behaviour upon the Addre&s;s: luckily for me, I had never &s;poken to any body about it, but to two

per&s;ons, favourite &s;ervants of his Royal Highne&s;s, and particular friends of mine, Lords Middle&s;ex; and Baltimore, who join|ed us as we were talking of it very calmly; he &s;eemed to be of our opinion, and &s;aid he had told Cotton we &s;hould not divide with them: I knew that Lord Middle&s;ex had told him how it pa&s;&s;ed, and if he would give me leave to bring Lord Balti|more to him, he would inform his Royal Highne&s;s that there was not the lea&s;t heat among $ny of us all. (I knew Baltimore was the author of this dirty piece of cun|ning.) That by this, he might &s;ee, if he plea&s;ed, what credit was to be given for the future to tho&s;e, who brought him this piece of intelligence. He thanked me, and was very gracious, and talked it off as well as he could, but in the multiplicity of di&s;cour&s;e, owned to me that Baltimore had told him, but meant no harm, &amp;c. I replied, I had never &s;een bu&s;ine&s;s done in a meeting of a dozen, like that, on the 15th day, before the &s;e&s;&s;ion: that tho&s;e meetings were always declaratory, tho' in the &s;hape of deliberation. That
<PB N="24" REF="36">
the fir&s;t concoction was always between the Prince and three or four per&s;ons at mo&s;t: that I hoped to have laid my poor opinions before him in that manner, with two or three only; that I hoped to have found a friend there, e&s;pecially Lord Mid|dle&s;ex, whom I thought, upon all ac|counts, ought to be at the fir&s;t dige&s;tion: that then we &s;hould properly lay our thoughts jointly before his Royal High|ne&s;s, or, if we differed, could rea&s;on it out with one another, and he might judge which &s;ide to adhere to. But to combat the opinions he adopted, &s;eparately with him, was impo&s;&s;ible: we could not, we ought not to di&s;pute with him, as we did with each other.</P>
<P>He was a good deal &s;taggered at what I &s;aid about Lord Middle&s;ex, and &s;aid, he ought, no doubt, to be of the great meeting: I &s;aid, of both &s;ure, and added &s;omething much in his favour. I then told him, that I found very little di&s;po&s;i|tion to friend&s;hip and cordiality with me, in tho&s;e whom he &s;eemed principally to

confide in, &amp;c. He &s;aid, I mu&s;t not won|der there was a little &s;hyne&s;s at fir&s;t, there was &s;o many &s;tories, &amp;c. &amp;c. I replied, that I hoped he did not think, I men|tioned it by way of complaint, for if it were not with relation to his &s;ervice, I &s;hould never think of de&s;iring the favour and countenance of any one or of all of tho&s;e gentlemen, as any &s;ort of addition to me. That, as he thought it for his &s;ervice, I already had done, tho' fruitle&s;sly, and would continue to do every thing, and go all the way to obtain their good will: that I beg|ged he would ob&s;erve, that in con&s;equence of his &s;ervice and commands, I would chearfully do this, but, &s;eparate from his &s;ervice and commands, it never could have entered into my imagination to have made court to tho&s;e gentlemen, becau&s;e I never could think, nor did I believe, any body el&s;e would, that tho&s;e gentlemen any where, or at any time, could do me any honour by admitting me among them. He then &s;aid, that, to be &s;ure, I was in a &s;ituation and upon a footing that I ought not to make court to any man in England;

That I had, long, had this particular point of Dunkirk un|der con&s;ideration: was determined to be at the expence to know, and to procure evidence of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of it, but my
<PB N="34" REF="46">
acquaintance lay &s;o much out of the mer|cantile way, that I was at a lo&s;s how to go about it; that I had pitched upon Mr. Sheriff Jan&s;en, being a trader him&s;elf, and much conver&s;ant in trade, as a proper per|&s;on to inform and a&s;&s;i&s;t me: that the great fit of &s;ickne&s;s he fell into had, till now, di&s;abled him from going out, and that ye&s;terday was the fir&s;t time I could get him to dinner. That I &s;uppo&s;ed, that, tho' I was &s;o unfortunate as not to be rea|dy, his Royal Highne&s;s was well inform|ed of all things nece&s;&s;ary to make out the charge, &amp;c. He &s;aid, no; but the throw|ing it out, would make the Mini&s;try feel they had <HI>la corde au col</HI>, and it was an op|portunity to abu&s;e them, &amp;c.

That if I could have brought this af|fair up to that point, then I had de&s;igned to lay it before his Royal Highne&s;s, with this only remark, how far he thought proper to venture the con&s;equences with France, in the pre&s;ent condition of this country.
<PB N="35" REF="47">
He &s;aid, the Tories wanted &s;omething to be done, and if he did not do &s;omething, they immediately thought he was nego|ciating. I told him al&s;o, that I had been, for &s;ome time, getting &s;uch lights as I could into the affair of Nova Scotia, that I de&s;igned to lay it before him, when I had brought it to be worthy of his con|&s;ideration; but it was my misfortune to think, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to be armed with full proofs and conviction of every &s;ort of the charge, before we brought it into the Hou&s;e. Upon that foot I &s;ub|mitted, that, in ca&s;e upon this que&s;tion of Dunkirk, it &s;hould come out, that the port was left ju&s;t in the &s;ame condition it remained, under the treaty of Utrecht, without any innovation &s;ince the war, (the Mini&s;try not having already enforced a &s;tricter execution of that treaty, than ever had been enforced) it would not, I feared, make a very &s;trong point again&s;t them. He was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, No, to be &s;ure, &s;o long an acquie&s;cence would great|ly dimini&s;h the objection. Upon the&s;e words I left him, and went directly to the

Hou&s;e. In the debate, I argued again&s;t the inexpediency and dangers, (which were the objections, &s;et up by the Court, to granting the&s;e papers) that there could be <HI>none</HI>, becau&s;e if it appeared that there had been no innovations &s;ince the war, and that the po&s;t was in the &s;tate it had remained under the treaty of Utrecht&mdash; though I did not give it up, but &s;till did in&s;i&s;t we had a right to a fuller execution of that treaty confirmed by this, and there|fore I did not give it up. Yet, if that appeared to be the ca&s;e, no danger or inconveniency could ari&s;e from the mo|tion, becau&s;e I was &s;ure that I, for one, would not, and I believed that no gentle|man, upon that account, would move any thing, that might occa&s;ion a rupture with France.</P>
<P>At the end of the debate, Lord Egmont, who made the motion, recapitulated what had been &s;aid again&s;t it. He began, by going out of his way, to &s;ay, that he mu&s;t fir&s;t declare, that he was &s;orry to differ with me, but did not agree, that it would

be &s;ufficient to excu&s;e the Mini&s;try; if it &s;hould appear, as I had &s;tated it, that things remained at Dunkirk, as they were left before the war, &amp;c. &amp;c. I was much &s;urpri&s;ed at this, con&s;idering the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of his Royal Highne&s;s a few hours before. We were beat by a very great majority. This night was publi&s;hed the vile&s;t and mo&s;t rancorous pamphlet again&s;t me, that, I believe, any age or country can &s;hew; the author of it taking, by implication, the character of being in the Prince's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Went to Lord Middle&s;ex with the<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Feb."> words (as near as I could recollect) writ|ten down, which I had u&s;ed in the debate, and which he had heard.

Mr. Ralph and Dr. Sharp came after dinner, much conver&s;ation about the pamphlet,

Af|ter dinner went to Carleton Hou&s;e; ju&s;t as I came thither, I was followed in by Dr. Lee, who brought old Coram with pro|po&s;itions for a vagabond ho&s;pital. I was told that the Prince had a&s;ked for me &s;e|veral times: I was immediately called in: I told the Prince, that Dr. Lee was in the hou&s;e, and that I did not wi&s;h to make him wait: he pretended, that he had for|got he had been long appointed, to bring Coram on that day, but that he would go out to him, and that they were to go up to the Prince&s;s. I &s;aw that his Royal High|ne&s;s had &s;ent for him on purpo&s;e, and therefore &s;aid, that I had nothing to &s;ay to him, but what I &s;hould be glad that Dr. Lee &s;hould hear. He went out to them, and after a &s;hort &s;tay &s;ent them up. He returned and began to talk about the earthquake, which conver&s;ation I continued a little, when I a&s;ked, if the Doctor was

to come down&mdash;he &s;aid, yes. When the Doctor came, I &s;uffered the di&s;cour&s;e to continue general, to &s;ee if he meant only, to give the Doctor the opportunity of making a civil vi&s;it. But, at la&s;t, his Royal High|ne&s;s applying to me, &s;aid, he thought I had &s;omething to &s;ay to him: this, by the Doctor's not moving, made it plain; and therefore I began by &s;aying, that I &s;hould not have pre&s;umed to a&s;k that favour, yet it was a very particular plea&s;ure to me, that he was &s;o good as to admit Dr. Lee to be pre&s;ent, and to hear what I had to lay before his Royal Highne&s;s. That I mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, return my mo&s;t humble thanks for the indignation he had expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the vile and rancorous pamphlet, which had been publi&s;hed again&s;t me, &amp;c. He &s;aid that, as &s;oon as it was &s;ent to him, he &s;aw that it was de&s;igned to per&s;onate Mr. Nugent&mdash;that he immediately &s;ent for him, who denied every part of it with the utmo&s;t abhorrence&mdash;that Lord Eg|mont did the &s;ame, &amp;c.&mdash;ju&s;t as Lord Middle&s;ex related. I replied, that I had never thought &s;o ba&s;ely of either of them
<PB N="43" REF="55">
as to &s;u&s;pect them: that if I had been &s;o injurious to either, yet, after &s;o &s;olemn a denial before the highe&s;t tribunal, their ma&s;ter, their Prince, near being their King, every trace, or thought of &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion mu&s;t be for ever entirely laid out of the que&s;tion: but that it was evident that the character a&s;&s;umed, was of one of the family. Dr. Lee &s;aid, he had never heard of it, till la&s;t Wedne&s;day, and, as he dete&s;ted all things of that nature, had not yet &s;een it, and believed, he never &s;hould. The Prince &s;aid, every body was infa|mou&s;ly abu&s;ed: he and his father had been often &s;o; that it would do me no hurt, &amp;c. I told him that I was very unfortu|nate, if I explained my&s;elf &s;o ill, as to be thought to complain of the pamphlet fur|ther than as it injured his &s;ervice; that I had hitherto, I thought, mentioned it, only as a ground to return him my mo&s;t hum|ble thanks for his generous interpo&s;ition, without being applied to: but that I now beg'd to make another plain and evident u&s;e of it.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="56">That though it was now beyond que&s;|tion, that this libel did not proceed from any of his family, yet, it was as much be|yond que&s;tion, that the behaviour of many of his family had given the author ground to &s;uppo&s;e, that the a&s;&s;umed character might pa&s;s for the real one, and that it was evidently meant, to fix the charge of my intru&s;ion into the family, and their dete&s;|tation of me, to create differences, if there were none, and to publi&s;h and inflame them, if there were. That to this fact, thus plainly proved by the pamphlet, I would add another, which I thought very unfortunate to my&s;elf. That I knew how di&s;agreeable it was, to bring gentlemen head to head, and that I fore&s;aw, his Roy|al Highne&s;s would not like to admit it. But that I could prove (though now I cho&s;e to do it by rea&s;on only, and colla|teral facts) that there was, I did not know what to call it, an opinion, a re&s;olution among the gentlemen his &s;ervants and fol|lowers (excepting Dr. Lee, whom they nominally excepted) to look upon me as an improper and unprofitable &s;ervant, and
<PB N="45" REF="57">
would not unite or communicate with me. That I knew this to be true, and looked upon it as a great misfortune to me, be|cau&s;e, though it did not become me to &s;ay before his Royal Highne&s;s how I came into his family, yet, I certainly embraced, with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure, the opportunity of belonging, as a &s;ervant, to a Prince, whom of all mankind I &s;hould have wi&s;hed to have pa&s;&s;ed my life with, if his misfor|tune and the misfortune of the public had placed him in a private &s;tation. That the di&s;appointment of &s;o flattering a view was the more &s;en&s;ible, becau&s;e I was &s;ure, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;ome fault, and that no &s;mall fault; becau&s;e, after what had &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed at the other end of the Mall (St. James's) and the lively &s;en&s;e his Royal Highne&s;s had expre&s;&s;ed of it, I could not, and did not imagine, that any man, or body of men would be hardy enough to combine, to pre&s;cribe to him whom he &s;hould employ, to what degree, or in what manner. This, as I knew it would, fired him, and though till this, he had kept the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence, he now inter|rupted
<PB N="46" REF="58">
me, and &s;aid, nobody &s;hould pre|tend to do that by him; that he allowed, &s;ometimes, one, and &s;ometimes, another to lay their opinions before him, but no|body pre&s;umed to direct him, and appealed to Dr. Lee, if any one treated him in that manner, &amp;c. &amp;c. I replied that I had &s;aid &s;o, and under&s;tood it &s;o, and that made this treatment the more &s;en&s;ible, becau&s;e I was &s;ure it mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome fault of mine, which I beg'd to be acquainted with, for it plainly appeared that the di&s;|like to me was real.</P>
<P>That I mu&s;t now proceed to another thing, which, I once thought, a mo&s;t cer|tain fact, but which I had &s;ince found was grounded on a mi&s;take; that I was about to &s;ay, that his Royal Highne&s;s a little contributed to lead me into that mi&s;|take, by telling me, when he was mo&s;t graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to command my &s;ervices, that all his family, as well as him&s;elf, were de&s;irous of it. That I had heard the &s;ame, indeed, on all hands, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable had them&s;elves, long, often,
<PB N="47" REF="59">
and with great zeal a&s;&s;ured me of their warme&s;t de&s;ires, and had even taken cre|dit to them&s;elves, for having earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed his Royal Highne&s;s to call me to that honour, which they now thought me &s;o unworthy of. That, therefore, I beg'd they might be a&s;ked, fairly and openly, what was the rea&s;on of &s;o total an altera|tion, as well as &s;o &s;udden an one: for I had thought, that I perceived a difference, even before we came to town, the la&s;t time, from Cliefden. That, as to arro|gance and &s;ufficiency, and de&s;ign to govern his Royal Highne&s;s and them, which I &s;uppo&s;ed, had been plentifully inculcated; I beg'd (and I was glad to do it before the Doctor) he would be plea&s;ed to declare fir&s;t as to him&s;elf, if I had fatigued him with audiences, or had laid hold of the many other opportunities I had, to obtrude my own thoughts upon him, or to know his; to complain to him, that he did not communicate what he was doing to me, and take my opinions, or to pre&s;ume to expo&s;tulate with him, or blame what he had done for not communicating with me.

He &s;aid, No indeed, but twice, as he re|membered&mdash;once, was about a paper I had drawn to lay before him, and the other time, when the printer of the Remem|brancer was taken up. I put him in mind, that, at that time, I mentioned to him the alteration I ob&s;erved in his &s;ervants, which was &s;o long ago as la&s;t November. I then a&s;ked if, in the many lei&s;ure hours of pri|vate life, I had ever &s;poken ill of any one of them, or &s;o much as complained, or endeavoured to le&s;&s;en or depreciate them or their performances. He &s;aid, No: but to be &s;ure I did not expre&s;s any partiality to &s;chemes which I did not approve of&mdash; (but he did not an&s;wer &s;o fully and fairly upon this head, as the truth is) I then &s;aid, I would not de&s;ire his Royal High|ne&s;s to declare, if tho&s;e gentlemen had treated me with the &s;ame fairne&s;s&mdash;as I was &s;ure he would an&s;wer that to him&s;elf. As to the governing them, did I ever in|terfere with them? They formed their own bu&s;ine&s;s, their papers, their own mo|tions, without the lea&s;t communication with, or complaint from me: that I was

&s;orry for it, as they made me a u&s;ele&s;s &s;er|vant to him in Parliament; for that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to go thither, and follow their motions at &s;ight and at hearing, and then to be di&s;owned for my pains. He laughed, and &s;aid, it was becau&s;e they had nothing to communicate; they had done nothing that he knew of. The mutiny bill was an agreed point by all, and they had had nothing el&s;e. That as to the Dunkirk motion, he prote&s;ted it was a thought of his own, that Dr. Lee knew nothing of it, even when he &s;ent it to me by Lord Middle&s;ex. I replied, that, in a conver&s;ation, the grounds of which were my misfortune in being rendered u&s;ele&s;s to a ma&s;ter, who&s;e unmerited goodne&s;s and favour, were my &s;ole ambition and re|liance, it was impo&s;&s;ible that I could change them &s;o gro&s;&s;ly, as to be brought to complain, or to &s;uffer him for a &s;ingle moment to think, that I did complain of him. That I received the communication he had honoured me with, as a mark of his favour, with much re&s;pect: that what I &s;poke of was the non-communication,
<PB N="50" REF="62">
and di&s;avowal of the re&s;t of his &s;ervants, both in the mutiny bill and on another occa&s;ion. He &s;aid, that as to puni&s;hing mutiny with death, he mu&s;t own to me that he, as well as they, differed from me, and had accordingly acted la&s;t year: and that Lords Carli&s;le and Bathur&s;t had dif|fered with Lord Bath upon that clau&s;e; for which he appealed to Dr. Lee, who &s;aid he was confined by illne&s;s (as was I) from coming to the Hou&s;e. As to what happened upon the motion, he was &s;orry for it, but thought it was of no great im|portance. I &s;aid, with &s;ome warmth, that I thought it was of the highe&s;t importance to him: was it to pa&s;s for his &s;en&s;e, was <HI>he</HI> to appear in the light of declaring, that he would, if he were now King, or would force his father to, begin a new broil with France, at this time, in the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces of this country, becau&s;e fifteen months after &s;uch a war ended by &s;uch a peace, France had not carried the demolition of Dunkirk, farther than it had been carried for thirty-two years la&s;t pa&s;t? Was this a point to be maintained? Was it
<PB N="51" REF="63">
a doctrine fit for him to appear as the pro|moter of? I thought it was not, it was $mprudent, it could not be &s;upported, $nd, above all, mo&s;t prejudicial to his &s;er|$ice, to have it thought he gave ear to &s;uch ra&s;h councils: be&s;ides, that his Royal Highne&s;s had agreed with me, the la&s;t $hing he &s;aid to me that very morning, that in the above-mentioned ca&s;e, if it came out only &s;o, the long acquie&s;cence much le&s;&s;ened, if it did not take away the objection. I beg'd pardon for being warm about the con&s;equence of the doctrine, be|cau&s;e that was not the u&s;e I intended to make of it; what I meant to e&s;tabli&s;h by it, was, to prove a &s;ettled re&s;olution in his family, that they would have nothing to do with me, for when Mr. Pitt, who an&s;wered Lord Egmont, came to that part, he pre&s;&s;ed his argument thus: "If it &s;hould come out, that there is no innova|tion, as I verily believe, the truth is, and that it is, as it was left by the treaty of Utrecht, explained in 1717, will any man &s;ay that it is a crime in the Mini&s;try, or a rea&s;on to quarrel with France? will
<PB N="52" REF="64">
any gentleman &s;ay it? does any one &s;ay it?" To this his Lord&s;hip made no reply in affirmation of what he had laid down i$ contradiction to me, which proves to a demon&s;tration, that he went out of his way, in concert with tho&s;e in conjunction with him, to &s;hew the world by a publick di&s;avowal, that they di&s;claimed all concert and connection with me: whether that was for <HI>his</HI> &s;ervice, he be&s;t knew. I beg'd to be under&s;tood, that, in all I had &s;aid, my concern was only in relation to his &s;ervice; if he was &s;atisfied, I was. I de|&s;ired to govern nobody, to &s;upplant nobo|dy: but that I could not follow his fami|ly in public, in whatever they plea&s;ed to &s;tart; that in things I was not con&s;ulted about, where my advice and opinion was neither taken, nor even a&s;ked, I could not go down and appear to approve and &s;up|port: that I was &s;orry it rendered my &s;er|vices u&s;ele&s;s to him in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, but I could not put my&s;elf upon that footing: he &s;aid, to be &s;ure it was not to be expected from me, or to that effect. I replied, that it was very well; I
<PB N="53" REF="65">
was perfectly &s;atisfied, if he was. I then began to put him in mind, that I had not been idle; that I had thought both of the point of Dunkirk, and of Nova Scotia; and had looked into &s;everal things, that might be introductive to the publick ac|counts; and had, above a month ago, hinted &s;omething of it to Dr. Lee, and told him, that I hoped for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. [This the Doctor readily confirmed.] That it might go far, and affect &s;everal families; whether his Royal Highne&s;s would care to go &s;o far, he would be the be&s;t judge. That when I had thought upon any point, in which I could &s;ee day-light; after I had dige&s;ted it a little, I cho&s;e to lay it before a friend or two in the fir&s;t place; if then we liked it, and could give it a body, we &s;hould then lay it before his Royal Highne&s;s for his approbation: if it met with that, then, and not till then, I &s;hould think of communicating it to tho&s;e, who were chiefly to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the execution of it. That this might be go|verning, for ought I knew; but that this was the way of doing bu&s;ine&s;s which I had
<PB N="54" REF="66">
learnt, and indeed, that I had never known any other practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>They both laughed and &s;aid, to be &s;ure it was not governing, and was the only way of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s. I replied, it was the only way I knew, and it might be governing; but if it was, his Royal Highne&s;s would plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that I had not done even that, yet. I then ob|&s;erved to him, how extremely hard it was for a minority, to bring any con&s;iderable, national abu&s;e, into ab&s;olute, undeniable proof, all the offices and documents being in the hands of the court; and I de&s;ired him to look back through all the oppo&s;i|tions for forty years pa&s;t, &s;aying, that I could recollect but one, that was brought home and fixed upon the mini&s;try, which was this very point of Dunkirk: and this his Royal Highne&s;s readily agreed to.</P>
<P>This, to the be&s;t of my memory, was the mo&s;t, if not all the material part that pa&s;&s;ed. The conver&s;ation became general for a time, and then his Royal Highne&s;s
<PB N="55" REF="67">
called for a chair, and left Dr. Lee and me together.</P>
<P>When we were alone, I told the Doctor that I knew there was a combination again&s;t me, that I could prove it, and they knew I could prove it: but that, &s;ince I had had an opportunity of explaining my&s;elf fully to his Royal Highne&s;s, in the pre&s;ence of &s;o good a witne&s;s as him&s;elf, I was entire|ly indifferent as to the event. The Doctor a&s;&s;ured me, in a &s;eeming friendly, and warm manner, that he &s;hould always be glad to act with me, in every thing that might be for the &s;ervice of the Prince, and the utili|ty of the country. I thanked him pro|perly, and de&s;ired him to remember, that I had de&s;ired, and even in&s;i&s;ted with, the Prince, to declare if ever, or at any time, or in what, I had ever attempted to govern him, or complained, that I did not; adding, that po&s;&s;ibly I might have had &s;uch an idea, might have attempted it, might have mi&s;carried, and been reprimanded for it, and might have grown wi&s;er: but if I had done it at all, I &s;hould &s;carcely have chal|lenged

the Prince, before him, to declare it. The next thing I beg'd him to re|member was, that I had fully apprized the Prince, that, in what I was not con|&s;ulted about and advi&s;ed with, I would have nothing to do with in Parliament, and that I would not go down thither upon that footing, and &s;o we parted.</P>

That the Prince was &s;o far in it, that, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;approbation of his council, he had or|dered

a privy &s;eal to be made out, to the Lord Warden of the Stanneries, to call and hold a parliament on or before the &s;econd of November.</P>
<P>That the nature of the Prince's revenue upon tin, was as follows&mdash;All tin, which is rai&s;ed throughout the Dutchy of Corn|wall, mu&s;t be brought to the Prince's &s;melting-hou&s;e, and when &s;melted, pays four &s;hillings for every hundred weight, (which is 120<HI>l.</HI>) Then, when made into pigs, it goes to the coinage, which is only a &s;tamp, with the Prince's arms; and then, and not before, is marketable.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this duty of four &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> hundred weight throughout the dutchy, no tin can be di&s;po&s;ed of, till the Duke has taken the quantity he plea&s;es. This is called the preemption. This preemption has never been exerci&s;ed by Princes, and &s;eldom lea&s;ed out. Once it was under|taken by Queen Anne, and Lord Trea&s;urer Godolphin, and Mr. Bo&s;cawen (afterward Vi&s;count Falmouth) on the other part:
<PB N="70" REF="82">
by which, for the pre&s;ent exigence, the crown got the power in &s;everal boroughs, though they lo&s;t by the undertaking, which was occa&s;ioned by the war.

<P>La&s;t year, the two companies of mine adventurers, and mine battery, both peti|tioned the Prince for the lea&s;e of this pre|emption, the petitions were referred to his privy council and rejected.

<P>This not &s;ucceeding, a petition has late|ly been obtained from the tinners, pray|ing for a parliament, which was, as I have &s;aid, rejected by the council, who &s;uppo&s;ed it was meant to procure a lea&s;e, for the advantage of tho&s;e, who were at the bottom of the former offers, which were &s;o very di&s;proportionate, that nothing but gro&s;s impo&s;ition could be expected from that quarter.

Prince. She &s;aw Dr. Lee one day before the death, and, ju&s;t after the event, &s;he had a long conference, till pa&s;t twelve, with him and the Earl of Egmont.

<P>When this unfortunate event happened, I had &s;et on foot, by the means of the Earl of Shafte&s;bury, a project for an union be|tween the independent Whigs and Tories, by a writing renouncing all tincture of Jaco|biti&s;m, and affirming &s;hort, but con&s;tituti|onal and revolutional principles. I had given his Lord&s;hip the paper: his good heart and under&s;tanding made him indefatigable, and &s;o far &s;ucce&s;sful, that there were good grounds to hope for an happy i&s;&s;ue. The&s;e parties, &s;o united, were to lay this paper, containing the&s;e principles, before the Prince; offering to appear as his party, now; and upon tho&s;e principles to un|dertake the admini&s;tration, when he was

<P><MILESTONE N="22." UNIT="Mar.">Several, in much di&s;tre&s;s, here. The Earl of Shafte&s;bury and Mr. William Beckford here, by their own appointment; they &s;aid, they came to a&s;k directions what to do under this fatal change of &s;ituation: I &s;aid, that it appeared to me that, if the Pelham party did not, in&s;tantly, drive out the Bed|ford intere&s;t, they mu&s;t be driven out by that, though now the weake&s;t party; but that the Bedford party would become the &s;tronge&s;t, having the King's favourite, and, now, only &s;on at their head, and at the head of the army; that he would, by their intere&s;t, &s;mall as it might be, and by the military intere&s;t, force the regency, and then, where are the Pelhams? That this nece&s;&s;ity enforced the nece&s;&s;ity of the projected union&mdash;that, being collected and publickly purged from Jacobiti&s;m, they be|came a re&s;pectable body: that if they were applied to for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they might then
<PB N="101" REF="113">
give it upon &s;uch conditions, and for &s;uch &s;hare of power as they might think &s;afe and honourable for them&s;elves and their country. Secondly, If they were not ap|plied to, and the court &s;hould take a right turn, that then they might, like hone&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted men, &s;upport the court without coming into it. And la&s;tly, What was mo&s;t to be dreaded, if they were not applied to, and the court &s;hould take either a dangerous turn, or &s;hould continue in the &s;ame con&s;uming way as at pre&s;ent, that then they would be ready to do, what it was their duty to do&mdash;oppo&s;e to the ut|mo&s;t and declare that they mean to wre&s;t the admini&s;tration out of tho&s;e hands, to take it into their own, and apply it to bet|ter purpo&s;es.

I told them that I had once drawn &s;uch a politi|cal creed for the la&s;t oppo&s;ition, but the gentlemen did not care to &s;ign it. That, now, I thought the younger part of our friends were very much in earne&s;t, and only wanted proper leaders and proper points to unite heartily. The Lords agreed that &s;omething &s;hould be dige&s;ted imme|diately: I told them that, to make a be|ginning, if they plea&s;ed, I would &s;end them the paper mentioned, in which &s;ome hints might po&s;&s;ibly be of u&s;e; they &s;eemed very de&s;irous of &s;eeing it, and I went home, and &s;ent it directly to the Earl of We&s;tmoreland.

<P><MILESTONE N="11." UNIT="April">I had much talk with Mr. O&s;wald on the &s;tate of affairs, and I told him the &s;teps I had taken towards an union of parties:

that I thought I owed it to our friend&s;hip to acquaint him that, if this great plan could be effected, I mu&s;t take my &s;hare in it. He approved the greatne&s;s and ho|ne&s;ty of the de&s;ign, and, at the &s;ame time, told me that Mr. Pelham had renewed his offers &s;ince the Prince's death, to which he had returned a very general, cool an&s;wer: he &s;aid that he hoped, from the renewing that offer, to find that Mr. Pel|ham would &s;hew re&s;olution enough to enter into engagements with &s;ome more of us, and avail him&s;elf of the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;i|tions of the people, to put him&s;elf upon his country, and get rid of his open ene|mies and fal&s;e friends, which was, now, mo&s;t practicable and even nece&s;&s;ary to pre|vent his being undone by both.</P>
<P>Lord Limerick con&s;ulted with me about<MILESTONE N="13." UNIT="April"> walking at the funeral.

<PB N="110" REF="122">
He expre&s;&s;ed a &s;trong re&s;olution to pay his la&s;t duty to his royal friend, if practi|cable. I beg'd him to &s;tay till I could get the ceremonial; he did, and we there found, in a note, that we might walk. Which note, publi&s;hed &s;even or eight hours before the attendance required, was all the notice that Lords, their &s;ons, and Privy Coun&s;ellors had (except tho&s;e ap|pointed to particular functions) that they would be admitted to walk.</P>
<P>At &s;even o'clock I went, according to the order, to the Hou&s;e of Lords. The many &s;lights that the poor remains of a much-loved ma&s;ter and friend had met with, and who was now preparing the la&s;t trouble he could give his enemies, &s;unk me &s;o low that, for the fir&s;t hour, I was incapa|ble of making any ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The proce&s;&s;ion began, and (except the Lords appointed to hold the pall and at|tend the chief mourner, and tho&s;e of his own dome&s;tics) when the attendants were called in their ranks, there was not one

Engli&s;h Lord, not <HI>one</HI> Bi&s;hop, and only one Iri&s;h Lord (Limerick), two &s;ons of Dukes (Earl of Drumlandrig and Lord Robert Bertie), one Baron's &s;on (Mr. Edge|cumbe) and two Privy Coun&s;ellors (Sir John Ru&s;hout and my&s;elf), out of the&s;e great bodies, to make a &s;how of duty to a Prince, &s;o great in rank and expectation. While we were in the Hou&s;e of Lords, it rained very hard, as it has done all the &s;ea|&s;on; when we came into Palace Yard, the way to the Abbey was lined with &s;oldiers, but the managers had not afforded the &s;malle&s;t covering over our heads; but, by good fortune, while we were from under cover, it held up. We went in at the S. E. door, and turned &s;hort into Henry the VIIth's chapel. The &s;ervice was per|formed without either anthem or organ. So ended this &s;ad day&mdash;<HI>Quem &s;emper acer|bum&mdash;&s;emper honoratum</HI>.</P>

That, as to borough matters, when he was pre&s;|&s;ed about Weymouth (as, to be &s;ure, both of us mu&s;t expect,) he thought the be&s;t language he could hold was, that he and I lived very well together, and that he had no room to think, that any thing would be done there, that would be di&s;agreeable o$

<P>I &s;aid, that, as to quitting the King's &s;er|vice, I did not do it by any compact with the Prince, that it was full four months after, before his Royal Highne&s;s made me any offers, and he then did it in &s;uch a manner, that left me no option to re|fu&s;e, without offending him for ever. That Mr. Solicitor General Murray knew this; and that I had living and written evidence to prove it inconte&s;tably. Since I came into the Prince's &s;ervice, I could appeal to him, whether my behaviour was not entirely calculated to &s;often, rather than to inflame, even to the lo&s;s of my fa|vour; whether, when the little, incendiary &s;y&s;tem prevailed, by which alone many of tho&s;e about his Royal Highne&s;s's per&s;on could ever be of any &s;ignificance, I did not endeavour to check it, and when I could not, did not ab&s;ent my&s;elf from the Hou&s;e, rather than take a part or countenance it. But, however, I de&s;ired the King &s;hould know, that I would not ju&s;tify with my Sovereign and my ma&s;ter, but &s;ubmitted

That this, with the intere&s;t I could, and was willing to center in his Maje&s;ty's &s;er|vice, I thought, might be &s;ufficient to re|move objections, (which had in reality no foundation) e&s;pecially, when conveyed through &s;o able, &s;o powerful, and, I tru&s;ted, &s;o friendly a channel.

<P><MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="July">I went early to town to take my leave of Mr. Pelham. After a little general conver&s;ation, I ro&s;e to go away, and &s;aid that the Solicitor General had told me, that it was not only his own, but Mr. Pelham's opinion, that nothing of our af|fair &s;hould be broken to the King, till his return from Hanover; and, therefore, I a&s;ked him no news. He replied, it was their opinion&mdash;that he had treated me with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity, and would con|tinue to do &s;o&mdash;that he &s;incerely wi&s;hed the thing, and would do every thing to bring it about&mdash;that all rea&s;ons were for it&mdash;that he had told me the peculiarity of temper, the prejudices, &amp;c. that made things di&s;agreeable, but that he would do his be&s;t.

King was informed that, when I quitted his &s;ervice, it was not by a bargain to en|ter into the Prince's, and that I never made the Prince any propo&s;ition at all&mdash;that it was more than four months after my quit|ing, that the Prince made me any. When his Maje&s;ty is de&s;ired to reflect, how much, when I came into the Prince's &s;ervice, I endeavoured to bring a little temper and moderation into it, and when I could not &s;ucceed in that, I would not &s;upport the incendiary part, and therefore did not go to the Hou&s;e. That the Prince&s;s, the Solicitor General, and other living wit|ne&s;&s;es, which I could produce, knew the fir&s;t, and that I could appeal to him&s;elf (Pelham) for the truth of the la&s;t. But, &s;etting all this a&s;ide, when his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be informed that I would not ju&s;|tify again&s;t my King and my ma&s;ter. That, &s;ince he was di&s;plea&s;ed, I was willing to think my&s;elf to blame, and humbly to de|mand his pardon, a&s;&s;uring him that my future &s;ervices &s;hould de&s;erve it. Here I de&s;ired him to ob&s;erve that, when a gen|tleman a&s;ks pardon, he is with us entitled
<PB N="150" REF="162">
to it, and it was what I would not do, when I was in the right, to any &s;ubject in the world, or to any Prince, but him&s;elf. When his Maje&s;ty was a&s;&s;ured that I was capable of facilitating his affairs, and that his chief &s;ervants were de&s;irous of receiv|ing me&mdash;</P>
<P>If all this, repre&s;ented by tho&s;e he did, and ought chiefly to rely on, would not do, I hoped Mr. Pelham would think, that I had di&s;charged my humble duty to his Maje&s;ty, and &s;hewed how de&s;irous I was, of pa&s;&s;ing the re&s;t of my life with him, and under his protection; for, I thought, I had &s;aid and done as much as any man of honour could do, or &s;ay, and had gone as far as was po&s;&s;ible. Mr. Pelham &s;aid, that he under&s;tood me perfectly well, that he wi&s;hed the thing cordially, and would do all imaginable ju&s;tice and leave nothing, in his power, unattempted to per&s;uade the King&mdash;that, in &s;hort, he had explained to me the bottom of his politicks&mdash;that he had a great regard for all Europe, but did not trouble him&s;elf much about it&mdash;
<PB N="151" REF="163">

If <HI>they</HI> would let him do this, he was at their &s;er|vice; if not, he could be contented to be a private man as well as another&mdash;not that he complained of the King, &amp;c.

<P>By the Prince&s;s's commands I pa&s;&s;ed the<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="July"> day with her at Kew. I arrived there about eleven in the morning, and we pa&s;&s;ed two or three hours together, alone, in the gardens.
<PB N="152" REF="164">
I informed her, by her order, of the &s;tate of the Iri&s;h affairs, which had made &s;o much noi&s;e. She a&s;ked me about a report &s;he had heard concerning a reconciliation between the Duke of Dor&s;et and Lord Middle&s;ex. I &s;aid, it would be impracti|cable, unle&s;s Lord Middle&s;ex would en|tirely &s;ubmit to his father; and even then, his behaviour had made the wound &s;o deep, that I could not be an&s;werable what the Duke would do. She &s;eemed de&s;irous of it, and wi&s;hed I would try. I told her that, as Lord and Lady Middle&s;ex were to be with me, in the country, I would &s;ee what his Lord&s;hip could be brought to, for from thence only it could move, if at all. I opened my&s;elf no far|ther to her. We came in, an hour before dinner. I dined at the Bed-chamber wo|man's table, where was Mr. Cre&s;&s;et, who behaved very courteou&s;ly to me, and is a very knowing man. After dinner, her Royal Highne&s;s &s;ent for me: we walked round Richmond Gardens: &s;he was at|tended by the Ladies Augu&s;ta and Eliza|beth, Me&s;&s;rs. Cre&s;&s;et and Bludworth.
<PB N="153" REF="165">
When we returned, &s;he ordered me to come in with her: we &s;at down, and &s;he turned the di&s;cour&s;e upon the mini&s;try. I &s;oon perceived &s;he had heard &s;omething of the late corre&s;pondence between Mr. Pelham and me; I therefore thought it fit to tell her that, from an opportunity which had ari&s;en from them, I had lately renewed my corre&s;pondence with them, and that I had taken occa&s;ion to tell them, that I was de&s;irous of ending my life, in quiet, with tho&s;e with whom I had began it, and whom I mo&s;t e&s;teemed, &amp;c. That they received my offers of friend&s;hip very civilly, and &s;eemed de&s;irous of receiving me; but that they apprehended the prejudices of the King again&s;t me, from the honour I had of belonging to the Prince, &amp;c. That the an&s;wer I made, was that my inclinations were &s;incere, as, I &s;uppo&s;ed, their kind acceptance was al&s;o; and that, for the re&s;t, I mu&s;t leave it to them. I then put her in mind, that I never a&s;ked any thing of his Royal Highne&s;s; that he never promi&s;ed any thing to me, till four months after I had quitted my employment; and
<PB N="154" REF="166">
that I, then, te&s;tified my &s;urpri&s;e to her, and acquainted her with all that pa&s;&s;ed. She &s;aid, &s;he remembered it very well. I then reminded her, how, from my appear|ance as a &s;ervant at Cliefden, I formed a plan of temper and moderation: that, knowing her right way of thinking, I ventured to communicate the plan to her, and beg'd her protection, in the execution of it, even before we returned to town&mdash; that I always had per&s;i&s;ted in it, and never would engage in any other. She replied, it was very true; &s;he was a very good witne&s;s of it, and would always a&s;|&s;ert it, &amp;c. I a&s;ked leave to wait on her at Kew, if &s;he &s;hould be there at my re|turn, which &s;he gave me in a very obliging manner, and then I came home to Ham|mer&s;mith by ten at night.</P>

<P>Went to town to meet the Duke of<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Oct."> Dor&s;et, I made his &s;on's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to him, and endeavoured to procure a full reconciliation. We had a long confe|rence.

<P>I went to town to &s;ee Mr. Pelham, and<MILESTONE N="4." UNIT="Oct."> laid before him the utility of his taking the occa&s;ion of Mr. Poulett's death, to make up the quarrel between the Earl and his brothers, by chu&s;ing Mr. Vere Poulett in his place. Mr. Pelham would not enter into it, as Mr. Vere had left them unhand|&s;omely, and had treated him ill, per&s;onally wherever he could be heard. He was in|deed for the union of the family, but he would have nothing to do with Mr. Vere, from his per&s;onal behaviour, though he could very well live and treat with tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed, and even per&s;onally oppo&s;ed him; which, con&s;idering tho&s;e he has about him, was, I thought, &s;aying in ef|fect, that he would take a blow from a &s;trong man, but not from a weak one. He then &s;aid, that they knew nothing po&s;itive as to the King's coming; but &s;hould know by the next courier, whether he de&s;igned to go to Hanover the next year. For that he had written to his brother, to beg to know
<PB N="158" REF="170">
of his Maje&s;ty, whether he would have the Parliament meet before, or after Chri&s;t|mas. We touched upon the &s;ub&s;idies at|tending the election of a King of the Ro|mans: Mr. Pelham's face fell, and he grew very unea&s;y upon it, and expre&s;&s;ed much di&s;like at the way it was conducted. He &s;aid, he was always again&s;t the&s;e &s;ub|&s;idies; that his idea was, that, if the di&s;|&s;enting electors would give in the ultima|tum of their demands, and perform the conditions before they received the re|ward, then, indeed, when we were &s;ure of our bargain, it might be worth con&s;idering if it were prudent to pay the price: but, to be buying one elector after another, was what he abhorred and could not ap|prove of. It mu&s;t have an end&mdash;he had declared &s;o in Parliament, and, as I was not pre&s;ent at the debate, he would tell me what he &s;aid, for he found that he had been mi&s;repre&s;ented.

Mr. Pelham replied, Who? Pitt? I &s;aid No; I thought it was Mr. Fox. He re|peated, in a low voice; Oh, Fox! with great &s;igns of unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;compo&s;ure, and in that &s;ituation I left him.</P>

<PB N="162" REF="174">
&s;he played, publickly, all the evening very deep. I a&s;ked with whom?

I a&s;ked her, how the&s;e demon&s;trations with him and the Bedfords, were to be repre|&s;ented to the King? She &s;aid, &s;he did not under&s;tand it. That, the Duke of Bedford, when he went out, treated the Duke of Newca&s;tle very ill to the King, not only as to publick, but to private matters with relation to Lord Gower: but that, &s;ome time afterwards, in the &s;ummer, the Duke of Bedford relented, and a&s;ked an audience, when he un&s;aid great part of what he had &s;aid before (and on which account the

King had been very much di&s;plea&s;ed with the Duke of Newca&s;tle) and attributed it to mi&s;information. I a&s;ked her, if that could be &s;o? She replied, &s;he was &s;ure of it, and knew it to be true. I ob&s;erved to her, that, notwith&s;tanding this, in the winter, his Grace (of Bedford) made a formal at|tack, and a very &s;trong one too, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, again&s;t the Saxon &s;ub&s;idy. She &s;aid, it was true, and that then the King was again very angry, and told <HI>her</HI> that the Duke of Bedford did not know his own mind. She her&s;elf, indeed, had no opinion of his judgment, but &s;aid, that he was governed by Lord Sandwich, of whom &s;he did not think very well; that he had made the Duke re&s;ign, and that they were, both, very much combined, and in intimate corre&s;pondence with the Duke of Cumberland. How they mana|ged with the King, &s;he did not know, but &s;he thought that they did not mean to act, at lea&s;t, to any purpo&s;e now: that <HI>their</HI> views were upon the minority.

his office, which office gave him a &s;ettled place in the Council of Regency. She an&s;wered, it was very true&mdash;it was Lord Sandwich's doing&mdash;but that &s;he was &s;atis|fied the minority was their point of action I &s;aid, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for her Roya$ Highne&s;s to look about her a little, and to &s;ecure friends in whom &s;he could tru&s;t, to &s;ee that ju&s;tice was done unto her in that event, not only from that quarter, but from all quarters, for &s;he mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that the pre&s;ent government had taken the be&s;t care, they could, to &s;ecure them&s;elves.

I &s;aid that, not know|ing what part her Royal Highne&s;s would take in the regency bill, I had prepared my&s;elf to oppo&s;e it: that I &s;hould have oppo&s;ed it in a very different manner from tho&s;e, who meddled with it: that I would have oppo&s;ed it upon principles, that &s;hould have made the King him&s;elf weary of the bill, not as an oppo&s;ition to his

Maje&s;ty and his mini&s;ters, but as a mea&s;ure of his mini&s;ters to &s;ecure their own power at the expence, and in the diminution of the power of the Crown: and I did believe, that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I was &s;ure of, I could have hung upon the bill &s;o long, and have &s;hewn it in &s;uch lights, that, at la&s;t, the King &s;hould have been out of humour with it before it pa&s;&s;ed, as I had rea&s;on to believe he was, &s;ince. That, however, when I found, that &s;he took the party of acquie&s;cence, which upon con|&s;ideration (though I thought, I &s;hould hardly have had the prudence to advi&s;e the mea&s;ure) I was thoroughly convinced was much the mo&s;t wi&s;e and advi&s;eable mode that could be t$ken, that, then, I dropped all &s;hew of oppo&s;ition and did not go to the Hou&s;e, that I might not fur|ni&s;h an handle to render me obnoxious: t$t, $ith the &s;ame view in the late tran|&s;action between Mr. Pelham and me, I ha$ $de ten &s;teps to their one, &s;o that if nothing came of it, they could not &s;ay, that I was de&s;irous to continue and propa|gate re&s;entments, &amp;c.</P>

much to the prudence of her conduct, her taking no notice of it. She &s;aid, &s;he could not however bear it, nor help, &s;ome|times, giving the King to under&s;tand her, in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;agreeable light.

I &s;aid that, I thought, &s;he had done all that could be expected; that prudence required letting this and &s;e|veral other matters &s;leep: that I was con|vinced, that the high and ju&s;t opinion people had of her, made them wait with patience. She &s;aid, they were very good to her; that George had no other way of thinking, and would, certainly, act accor|dingly; but yet, &s;he dur&s;t not let any body have the comfort of knowing it, lea&s;t they &s;hould put every thing into a flame: upon which, &s;he ob&s;erved to me the delicacy and tickli&s;hne&s;s of her &s;ituation.

the real di&s;po&s;ition of the Prince to be?&mdash; She &s;aid, that I knew him almo&s;t as well as &s;he did; that he was very hone&s;t, but &s;he wi&s;hed that he was a little more for|ward, and le&s;s childi&s;h, at his age; that &s;he hoped his preceptors would improve him. I beg'd to know what methods they took; what they read to him, or made him read; and whether he &s;hewed a par|ticular inclination to any of the people a|bout him. She &s;aid, &s;he really did not well know what they taught him; but, to &s;peak freely, &s;he was afraid not much: that they were in the country and followed their diver&s;ions, and not much el&s;e that &s;he could di&s;cover; that we mu&s;t hope, it would be better when we came to town. I &s;aid, that I did not much regard books, that what I the mo&s;t wi&s;hed was, that his Royal Highne&s;s &s;hould begin to learn the u&s;ages and knowledge of the world; be informed of the general frame and nature of this government and con&s;titution, and of the general cour&s;e and manner of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, without his de&s;cending into minutias. She &s;aid, &s;he was of my opinion, and
<PB N="172" REF="184">
that Stone told her, that, when he talked to the Prince upon tho&s;e &s;ubjects, he &s;eem|ed to give a proper attention and made pertinent remarks: that Stone was a &s;en|&s;ible man, and capable of in&s;tructing in things, as well as in books: that Lord Harcourt and the Prince agreed very well, but &s;he thought, that he could not learn much from his Lord&s;hip: that Scott, in her opinion, was a very proper preceptor: but that for the good Bi&s;hop, he might be, and &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he was, a mighty learned man, but he did not &s;eem to her very pro|per to convey knowledge to children; he had not that clearne&s;s which &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary; &s;he did not very well compre|hend him, her&s;elf, his thoughts &s;eemed to be too many for his words. That &s;he did not ob&s;erve the Prince to take very parti|cularly to any body about him, but to his brother Edward, and &s;he was very glad of it, for the young people of quality were &s;o ill educated and &s;o very vicious, that they frightened her. I told her, I thought it a great happine&s;s, that he &s;hewed no di&s;po|&s;ition to any great exce&s;&s;es, and beg'd to

know what were his affections and pa&s;|&s;ions. She repeated that he was a very hone&s;t boy, and that his chief pa&s;&s;ion &s;eem|ed to be for Edward. I &s;aid that, as her Royal Highne&s;s had mentioned the nega|tive which the mini&s;try &s;eemed to continue upon the Prince's friends, I pre&s;umed to a&s;k her about the young Prince's affections towards his father's memory; becau&s;e he was, now, bred in a manner, and in hands &s;o totally unacquainted with the late Prince, and with tho&s;e who had been about him, that he might very ea&s;ily be brought to forget them; which, I feared, at the fir&s;t &s;etting out in life, would give a very di&s;advantageous, if not a dangerous impre&s;&s;ion of him: that trifles are of con|&s;equence in the fir&s;t out&s;et (particularly tho&s;e that relate to the heart) to Princes, who&s;e lighte&s;t actions engage the attention, and who&s;e elevation expo&s;es them to the continual in&s;pection of mankind: that many good things lo&s;e their glo&s;s at lea&s;t by untoward impre&s;&s;ions: that a great deal of power might be required to do things, where affection and confidence
<PB N="174" REF="186">
were wanted, which a very little might bring about, where they were once e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by fir&s;t and favourable impre&s;&s;ions. That, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, I &s;hould be ex|tremely &s;orry that his Royal Highne&s;s &s;hould entirely forget tho&s;e, who had been faithfully attached to his father, as that attachment was the only rea&s;on that could be given to ju&s;tify the pro&s;cription which they, now, lie under. She &s;aid, that &s;he agreed with me, that nothing could be more di&s;advantageous and hurtful to him: that it would affect her very &s;en&s;ibly; that &s;he had no rea&s;on to apprehend it, as the Prince &s;eemed to have a very tender regard for the memory of his father, and that &s;he encouraged it as much as &s;he could: that when they behaved wrong, or idly (as children will do) to any that belonged to the late Prince, and who are, now, about her; &s;he always a&s;ked them how they thought their father would have liked to &s;ee them behave &s;o to any body that be|longed to him, and whom he valued; and that they ought to have the more kindne&s;s for them, becau&s;e they had lo&s;t their friend

and protector, who was theirs al&s;o; and &s;he &s;aid, &s;he found that it made a proper impre&s;&s;ion upon them. I humbly beg'd that &s;he would cultivate and improve the per&s;onal influence, which her many vir|tues, as well as natural affection gave her over the Prince: that I was &s;ure, that, from her influence, and the &s;ettled opinion of her prudence with all mankind, all the di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;en&s;ible among&s;t us, hoped for a happy &s;ettlement of the new reign: that I did not mean authoritavely and during a legal minority, but during the very young part of the King's life, and till time and inclination had brought him thoroughly to weigh and under&s;tand what the government of a great country was. She expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf civilly for the regard I te&s;tified for her, and &s;aid &s;he could have nothing &s;o much at heart as to &s;ee him do well, and make the nation happy. N. B.

&s;he could not but wonder at the very lit|tle regard which the Duke was plea&s;ed to to &s;hew her.

I came home between ten and eleven, and have been the more particular in this conver&s;ation, becau&s;e it carries an air of friend&s;hip and openne&s;s, which I, no way, expected from a great lady, who has e&s;tabli&s;hed a character for prudence in not opening her&s;elf much to any body, and of great caution to whom &s;he opens her&s;elf at all.</P>

I &s;aid, I could not conceive that they would &s;tir. He &s;aid, yes; for that Pitt's pa&s;&s;ion was ambition, not avarice&mdash;that he was at a full &s;top, as things were, and could have no hopes of going farther: he was once popular; and if he could again make a di&s;turbance, and get the country on his &s;ide, he then might have hopes: now, and on the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, he could have none. I replied, I thought they could not part with what they had, &amp;c. &amp;c.

He &s;aid, to be &s;ure, but not to him&mdash;that they knew his opinions too well&mdash;that, when they broke from me, he followed me&mdash;that he never was more than commonly acquainted with Pitt&mdash;that Pitt had once dined at his hou&s;e, and they might vi&s;it perhaps once in a winter&mdash;that his Lord&s;hip loved George Grenville per&s;o|nally, but no ways e&s;pou&s;ed his politicks: that, for him&s;elf indeed, his alliance with Lord Kildare naturally led him to Mr. Fox, and that he was much more likely to &s;uc|ceed than Pitt&mdash;that the Pitts could not be quiet, but had been dabbling with the Prince, and that their plans were pre|vented by the Prince's death, as, to be &s;ure, I knew, and Mr. Pelham knew: therefore they mu&s;t be di&s;agreeable to each other,

him&s;elf would be again&s;t him. But, &s;aid he, I think you are not acquainted with Fox, I replied, that I had always known him, and always liked him very well, but had not conver&s;ed much with him of late. He &s;aid, he wondered at it, and what &s;hould be the rea&s;on of it. I &s;aid, that I fancied it was occa&s;ioned by the other &s;ide, for though I liked Mr. Fox very well, it was po&s;&s;ible he might not much like me. He &s;aid, he could not believe it.

I was glad to learn her opinion, for I wanted to know it. I replied, that there were odd|ne&s;&s;es about them, which were peculiar to that family, and I had often told them &s;o. She &s;aid, there was &s;omething very odd among&s;t them, and laughing, added, that &s;he knew but one family that was more odd, and &s;he would not name that family for the world. I &s;aid, it did not become me to gue&s;s at her Royal Highne&s;s; but if it did, I was &s;ure I could not gue&s;s it in a hun|dred years. She laughed and &s;aid, <HI>&agrave; propos</HI>, there has been fine doings in our family; a very fine bu&s;tle indeed! I am glad we are rid of them. I &s;aid, it had indeed oc|ca&s;ioned a great deal of talk. She replied, &s;he was quite weary of hearing it&mdash;that there was &s;uch an outcry at two people's leaving them, as if they were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men in the nation; and who

occa&s;ioned as much wonder and outcry two years ago, when they came to them on account of their being too unknown to come thither&mdash;that &s;he knew nothing of the jacobiti&s;m, the arbitrary principles, the dangerous notions of tho&s;e who were accu&s;ed, or any &s;uch, attempted to be in|&s;tilled into the children&mdash;that &s;he could not conceive what they meant&mdash;that the Bi&s;hop, indeed, was teaching them logick, which, as &s;he was told, was a very odd &s;tudy for children of their age, not to &s;ay, of their condition. I &s;aid that, whatever they meant, they both mu&s;t often, before things came to the&s;e extremities, have applied to her Royal Highne&s;s, and have laid before her &s;ome o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;ons, at lea&s;t, for a ground for their re&s;olution to re&s;ign, when the King returned.

he often in&s;inuated, that there were tho&s;e about the Prince, who encouraged his Royal Highne&s;s again&s;t him, &amp;c.&mdash;that &s;he told him, as the truth was, that &s;he was entirely innocent of any &s;uch practices her|&s;elf, and did not know of any body who could be accu&s;ed of it; and particularly, could not perceive by the children, when they were with her, that any ill offices had been done him&mdash;that the la&s;t time the Bi&s;hop had been with her, he complained more &s;trongly of being di&s;regarded; he beg'd her protection, &s;hewing the great ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a preceptor's being re&s;pected and &s;upported, &amp;c. Upon which &s;he told him, that &s;he always inculcated in the children to &s;hew him great re&s;pect, and was very far from endeavouring, or even wi&s;hing, that it &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened: and this, &s;ays &s;he, not for love of you, my Lord, but be|cau&s;e it is fitting and nece&s;&s;ary; for if they are &s;uffered to want re&s;pect that is due to one degree, they will proceed to want it to another, till, at la&s;t, it would come up to me, and I &s;hould then have taught them to di&s;regard me. This, &s;he &s;aid, was the
<PB N="192" REF="204">
la&s;t conver&s;ation &s;he had with the Bi&s;hop. I a&s;ked her, if &s;he could remember when it was: &s;he an&s;wered, &s;he thought about the end of September, or &s;oon in October. That, as to Lord Harcourt, he never took the lea&s;t notice of her; that &s;he had hardly &s;een him, three times, the whole &s;ummer, though they lived &s;o near together at Kew: that, when he came for the Prince, &s;o far from &s;ending in, to her, he would &s;tay in the hall; and though pre&s;&s;ed to it by the &s;ervants, he would not come into the pic|ture-room, where we always &s;at, when &s;he was above, till &s;he came to us or &s;ent for us up.

and I might well wonder. But &s;o far from that, he never came near her: that he had been twice this year in Oxford&s;hire, and that &s;he never knew when he went, or when he returned: I then &s;aid, that I could not conceive, according to the com|mon form of things, even though his re|&s;olution might be taken, how it was po&s;|&s;ible that he could avoid waiting upon her, to lay &s;ome rea&s;ons before her Royal High|ne&s;s, by way of expo&s;tulation or apology, before the King came home: &s;he &s;aid, he never did, nothing like it: that, &s;ince his return from Oxford&s;hire, the very fir&s;t time &s;he &s;aw him, was at the foot of the &s;tairs at St. James's, the night the King came (Nov. 18); that the next time, was the birth-day (27th) in the private rooms, that he endeavoured to avoid her, but &s;he got between the door and him, and took him by the coat, and &s;aid, he was very fine: he &s;aid, Madam, it is all &s;he manufacture of Spitalfields, and &s;o walked off. That, the Tue&s;day before, he had been with the King, to repre&s;ent that her children were in the way of imbi$ing dangerous no|tions,

&amp;c. That he had no authority, and could do no good, unle&s;s Stone, Cre&s;&s;et, and Scott were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; that they were Jacobites, &amp;c. and had been bred &s;o, they and their families. I &s;aid, this charge upon their families and education made me &s;mile; for that, though I had a per|&s;onal regard for Lord Harcourt, and did &s;tedfa&s;tly believe, that he was as faithful a &s;ervant and &s;ubject, as any the pre&s;ent fa|mily on the Throne had: yet I was &s;orry to &s;ay, that I remembered his predece&s;&s;or, following the Oxford circuit, a very poor, but reckoned a very &s;hrewd lawyer; which &s;hrewdne&s;s in the poor profe&s;&s;or, as he ro&s;e, had ju&s;tice done it, and was called genius and abilities, as it really was, for he was very able, very &s;kilful, and more eminent by his talents and capacity than by his po&s;t. But, till the la&s;t years of his life, he was always e&s;teemed a thorough Jacobite: he even &s;tands impeached upon the&s;e princi|ciples, and though not proceeded again&s;t, he is excepted in &s;everal acts of grace. That I was &s;ure, Lord Harcourt abhorred tho&s;e principles, and would, with chear|fulne&s;s,

ri&s;que every thing for this royal family; but I thought it &s;trange that peo|ple &s;hould not allow conver&s;ion to be as natural and &s;incere in other families, as we had happily experienced it in his; and that, upon the whole, I could not imagine what they meant by this whole tran&s;ac|tion, as to the matter, and yet le&s;s, as to the manner. She &s;aid, that, however it was, the King was very well plea&s;ed with them; but that &s;he could ea&s;ily gue&s;s what they meant. I &s;aid, that now I was &s;e|rious in a&s;&s;uring her Royal Highne&s;s that I could not gue&s;s. She replied, one might gue&s;s by their falling upon Mr. Cre&s;&s;et, who had no more to do with the Prince's education, than I had&mdash;that they had a de&s;ign to get his place for another, and &s;he thought it was for Lord Talbot's brother; but as the King took her recommendation, now Cre&s;&s;et was to be brought into the quarrel&mdash;that the&s;e gentlemen were leagued with &s;ome greater people, whom &s;he need not name to me, to get the Prince to their &s;ide, and then, by their behaviour, to throw her off from
<PB N="196" REF="208">
her temper, and &s;o make their complaints to the King &s;tronger, and then to make her di&s;oblige his Maje&s;ty, in defending the accu&s;ed; not doubting, if they could once force her into any indi&s;creet warmth, to make &s;o plau&s;ible a &s;tory to the King, as might compa&s;s their de&s;ign, which is, to carry the Prince into tho&s;e other hands at la&s;t, by taking him from the people, now about him, and by degrees, con&s;e|quently, from her. This failing, behold the next &s;tep&mdash;the Bi&s;hop comes to take his leave of me, and with abundance of fawning and flattery, thanks me for all my goodne&s;s to him, and all the regard I had been plea&s;ed to &s;hew him, &amp;c. when he was in the family; hoping that I would believe, that he left it like an hone&s;t man. I replied, continued &s;he, that, for the regard I had &s;hewn him, or any &s;er|vices I had done him, he owed me no obli|gation; it was no more than was his due, and what I &s;hould always pay to any body, whom the King was plea&s;ed to put about my children in the &s;ame &s;tation&mdash;that as to the motives of his leaving the family,
<PB N="197" REF="209">
as I was not acquainted with them, I could &s;ay nothing about them. Then, &s;aid &s;he, comes my Lord of Harcourt, and he, in a drier way than the Bi&s;hop, takes his leave, by thanking me for the favours and &s;upport he had received from me, while he was in the family: and in return, I thanked his Lord&s;hip for the con&s;tant care and attendance he had be|&s;towed upon my &s;ons. I replied to her Royal Highne&s;s, that I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the whole before, by what I had heard from the publick talk; but that, now, I was a&s;toni&s;hed. She &s;aid, &s;he thought &s;he had &s;ome little rea&s;on to take it ill, that &s;uch grievous complaints &s;hould be made of ma|nagements about her &s;on, without giving her the lea&s;t previous intimation of them: that Lord Harcourt complained &s;trongly to the King of dangerous notions, and arbi|trary principles being in&s;tilled into the Prince; and that he could be of no u&s;e, unle&s;s the in&s;tillers of that doctrine. Stone, Cre&s;&s;et, and Scott, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. That, as he named no particulars, the King had &s;ent the Archbi&s;hop and the Chancellor to
<PB N="198" REF="210">
command Lord Harcourt to acquaint them with the particulars&mdash;that his Lord&s;hip's an&s;wer was, that the particulars were fit, only, to be communicated to the King, and that he would wait on his Maje&s;ty with them. (All this I knew before.) That he did &s;o, and that &s;he had &s;ince talked with the King, and his Maje&s;ty told her, that Lord Harcourt had only run over the &s;ame general topicks again, without enter|ing into any particulars at all: that the King had a&s;&s;ured her of this, and &s;he be|lieved, he had told her the truth. But, continued &s;he, they have mi&s;&s;ed their ends, for the King was in very good humour with her and the children, and imputed nothing to them in this whole tran&s;action. I &s;aid, that I was extremely plea&s;ed her Royal Highne&s;s had not been thrown off her temper by this behaviour, con&s;idering how offen&s;ive it was, how deep it was laid, and who were at the bottom of it: for that I, particularly, and I believed, all good men placed their chief hopes in the Prince's continuing in her hands and under her di|rection, and in her pre&s;erving that influence

over him, which was ju&s;tly due to her, as well from her prudence, as from nature.&mdash; &s;he replied, they would not find it ea&s;y to make her lo&s;e her temper. I told her of an anonymous letter &s;ent to Dr. Newton, a popular preacher, of St. George's, &s;etting forth the dangerous way the Prince's edu|cation was left in, and, after touching on the Doctor's popularity, concluding by putting it to him as a duty to take notice of it in the pulpit. She had not heard of it, and &s;eemed at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s what it meant. I &s;aid, the only meaning I could give it was, though perhaps with too much refinement, that they had or would write anonymous letters to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to forty or fifty of the London clergy, in hopes that, among &s;o many, one hot-headed fellow might be found, who would take fire at it, and endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by trying to rai&s;e a flame about it. But I did not think proper to tell her Royal Highne&s;s of another anonymous letter, which was &s;ent to General Hawley, on Wedne&s;day the 20th in&s;t. which, when it was opened, contained nothing to him, but
<PB N="200" REF="212">
was a &s;ort of a repre&s;entation or remon|&s;trance to the King from the Whig nobi|lity and gentry; &s;etting forth (as may be &s;een in my papers No. 9,) their great con|cern and apprehen&s;ions for the Prince's edu|cation from the hands in which he, now, is; their di&s;&s;atisfaction at the manner, in which the power of the crown was lodged; that, indeed, &s;ome of tho&s;e who by their offices, were called mini&s;ters, and ought to be &s;o, were &s;ometimes tumbled and to&s;&s;ed about, but that there was a permanence of power placed in three men, whom they looked upon as dangerous; and that the&s;e men entirely tru&s;ted, and were governed by two others; one of whom had the ab|&s;olute direction of the Prince, and was of a Tory family, and bred in arbitrary prin|ciples; and the other, who was bred a profe&s;&s;ed Jacobite of a declared Jacobite family, and who&s;e brother, now at Rome, was a favourite of the Pretender and even his Secretary of State. In &s;hort, the co|rollary was, that Murray, (Solicitor Gene|ral) and Stone, governed this country. This letter was &s;ent to General Hawley with an

That I wi&s;hed the pre|&s;ent mini&s;try unfeignedly well, and was de&s;irous to employ all my credit and friends in their &s;ervice; that, be&s;ides my friends and their intere&s;t, I would un|dertake to chu&s;e five members for them, without putting them to a &s;hilling ex|pence, or de&s;iring them to make a tide-waiter: that I thought much, if not their all, depended on a new Parliament, and I was willing to give them my poor a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, as her Royal Highne&s;s had e&s;pou&s;ed their cau&s;e, and as I was, in my opinion and inclination, made more prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in their favour, than for any body, who was in any likelihood to &s;ucceed them. Here ended all that was material. I am at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s, why this great lady pre&s;&s;es con|ver&s;ations of this nature upon me; I nei|ther attempt, nor de&s;erve her confidence, nor am I &s;o low, as to be fond of half confidences. I think &s;he mu&s;t become nothing, by either &s;iding with the mini&s;|try or the Duke. A third party, of her own, is her only re&s;ource in ca&s;e of a minority, but where &s;he will find that

It may, po&s;&s;ibly, be her wi&s;e&s;t party, and, probably, the party &s;he has or will &s;hortly take, to take hands privately with the Duke of Cumberland, and, in&s;tigated by the timidity of the mini&s;ters, agree with him and repeal the regency bill, and be thus &s;ole regent in appearance, and he in effect. This I think certain, that, if they do not immediately remove the Duke from the army, and with ecl&agrave;t, he will over|power both her and the mini&s;try, who will probably think of &s;truggling when it is too late, but who will not, I think, dare to &s;trike when it might be ea&s;y and deci&s;ive.</P>

I &s;aid, I was very glad that all their Royal High|ne&s;&s;es were plea&s;ed with the Bi&s;hop, whom I did not know by &s;ight, but that &s;he would give me leave to hope, that they were all very well plea&s;ed with the new Governor al&s;o, who was my very good friend, and for whom I had a very great regard. She replied, yes, indeed; that &s;he was but little acquainted with him, but, from all &s;he &s;aw, &s;he had a very good opinion of him; that he was very well bred, very complai&s;ant, and attentive, &amp;c. and the children liked him extemely: but, &s;ays &s;he, I look upon a Governor as a &s;ort of pageant, a man of quality for &s;how, &amp;c.

It may be that it is not, yet, too late to acquire a competence, and that is what I am mo&s;t &s;olicitous about; and if this man, by his manner, &s;hould hit upon the means of giving them that, I &s;hall be mightily plea&s;ed. The Bi&s;hop of Norwich was &s;o confu&s;ed, that one could never tell what he meant, and the children were not at all plea&s;ed with him. I &s;aid, that the whole tran&s;action was a very odd thing, that, cer|tainly, there mu&s;t be &s;ome bottom to it, which we at a di&s;tance could not di&s;cern. She replied, &s;he thought &s;o; that the &s;tories about the hi&s;tory of the Pere d'Orleans was fal&s;e: the only little di&s;|pute, between the Bi&s;hop and Prince Ed|ward, was about le Pere Perefix's hi&s;tory of Henry the IVth, and that was nothing at all to produce &s;uch con&s;equences. That there mu&s;t be politicks at the bottom: that there was a &s;tory of the Bi&s;hop's hav|ing &s;aid, that Murray, (the Solicitor Gene|ral) when he was fir&s;t appointed, told him that Lord Harcourt was only a cypher;

I &s;aid, I was mo&s;t confident it was fal&s;e, that Mr. Murray had too much &s;en&s;e to meddle at all, with what did not belong to him; but if he had done it (which I could never believe) I was &s;ure it could only be in favour of his friend, Stone, with whom he was clo&s;ely connected: that I looked upon Mr. Murray to be a very emi|nent man, and much the mo&s;t able and efficient of all tho&s;e, who were openly and honourably attached to the mini&s;try. She &s;aid, it was very likely; &s;he thought they had very few friends, and wondered at their not getting more, and that it was their cowardice only which hindered them: that, if they talked of the King, &s;he was out of patience; it was as if they &s;hould tell her, that her little Harry below would not do what was proper for him; that ju&s;t &s;o, the

King would &s;putter and make a bu&s;tle, but when they told him that it mu&s;t be done from the nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;ervice, he mu&s;t do it, as little Harry mu&s;t when &s;he came down. I replied, I was &s;incerely &s;orry, not for the pre&s;ent, but that I apprehended this want of real, attached, and declared friends might produce ugly con&s;equences and conte&s;ts, in ca&s;e of a demi&s;e.

If they were not to be rewarded for their attachment, it was &s;ure|ly &s;trange that they were to have an exclu|&s;ion put upon them for it. He &s;huffled and he&s;itated upon this; but at la&s;t &s;aid, to be &s;ure it &s;hould be thought of, and brought about. I &s;aid, it was indeed &s;ur|pri&s;ing, for that tho&s;e gentlemen, in&s;tead of having acquired any merit by their &s;er|vices, were not even allowed the fair play that they would have had, if they had never entered into the &s;ervice of the royal family: I thought it very di&s;advantageous, becau&s;e, in ca&s;e of a demi&s;e, that all would be to be done, which ought to have been long &s;ettled, and ready to be done, in ca&s;e

I then entered into a detail (which I offered to prove) of the inju&s;tice and unrea&s;onable|ne&s;s of the&s;e prejudices, and then &s;aid, that from this long account, he might naturally expect a reque&s;t to enter into a ju&s;tification,
<PB N="226" REF="238">
either by my&s;elf or by him: but that I did not de&s;ire to ju&s;tify with the King. That all I de&s;ired him to &s;ay to the King was, that, though it was never in my intention to offend his Maje&s;ty, it was &s;ufficient, that he was di&s;plea&s;ed, for me to think my&s;elf to blame, and that, to induce him to for|give me, I humbly offered him my &s;ervi|ces and all the intere&s;t I had in the Hou&s;e, and out of it, for the re&s;t of my life. I added, that I thought this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and this offer of five members at lea&s;t, &s;hould be &s;ufficient to wipe away impre&s;&s;ions, even if I had been a declared Jacobite. He &s;aid, it was all that could be &s;aid, and all &s;hould be made of it, that his credit could make. But that, if it &s;hould be practicable, and I &s;hould be in any &s;tation, and the King &s;hould not be prevailed on to behave to me as I might ju&s;tly expect, I might grow un|ea&s;y and be di&s;&s;atisfied, as in the ca&s;e of Pitt, to whom they could never per&s;uade the King to appear commonly civil. I an&s;wered, no, not in the lea&s;t. He &s;aid, yes, I might fancy &s;o, and he believed I &s;hould. I replied, that I an&s;wered with
<PB N="227" REF="239">
certainty, becau&s;e I had con&s;idered and made up my mind about that. That all I wi&s;hed of the King was, to make me over to him (Pelham,) to let him di&s;po&s;e of me, as he thought fit, and &s;uffer him to receive my friend&s;hip, attachment and &s;ervices, that I de&s;ired by no means to encroach upon his Maje&s;ty's time, or thoughts or behaviour, provided he would give him (Pelham) leave to employ me, for his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ervice, in the way that was mo&s;t agreeable to him. That I would give him my rea&s;ons with the utmo&s;t freedom, which were, that, indeed, if I was a new man and in any &s;tation, I &s;hould, in paying my court, expect that &s;ort of civil return which was my due: but after &s;uch unworthy prejudices, and &s;o void of all foundation taken again&s;t me, I &s;hould never de&s;ire any conver&s;ation or intercour&s;e with his Ma|je&s;ty more than a di&s;tant, but profound re|&s;pect on my &s;ide, and that, as &s;eldom as was con&s;i&s;tent with the duty of a mo&s;t faithful and re&s;pectful &s;ubject. Upon the whole, Mr. Pelham behaved in &s;o open and noble a manner, as to chu&s;e to make it
<PB N="228" REF="240">
plain, ten times at lea&s;t, (though he did not make u&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ions preci&s;ely) that I &s;hould rather &s;ee that he wanted power, than have any doubt of his &s;incerity, if it did not &s;ucceed; and that the doubt of his &s;trength and power alone, hindered him from promi&s;ing po&s;itively to effect it: and therefore, if I judge this right, I am obli|ged to him, and am determined to be his friend, whether it &s;ucceeds or not.</P>

<P>Mr. Fo&s;&s;et, Me&s;&s;rs. Murray and Stone, were much acquainted, if not &s;chool fellows, in early life. Their fortune led them different ways: Fo&s;&s;et's was to be a

country lawyer and recorder of Newca&s;tle. John&s;on, now Bi&s;hop of Gloce&s;ter, was one of their a&s;&s;ociates. On the day the King's birth-day was kept, they dined at the Dean of Durham's, at Durham, this Fo&s;|&s;et, Lord Raven&s;worth, Major Davi&s;on, and one or two more, who retired after dinner into another room: the conver&s;a|tion turning upon the late Bi&s;hop of Glou|ce&s;ter's preferments, it was a&s;ked who was to have his Prebend of Durham: the Dean &s;aid, that the la&s;t news from London was, that Dr. John&s;on was to have it: Fo&s;&s;et &s;aid, he was glad that John&s;on got off &s;o well, for he remembered him a Ja|cobite &s;everal years ago, and that he u&s;ed to be with a relation of his who was very di&s;affected, one Vernon, a mercer, where the Pretender's health was frequently drunk. This, pa&s;&s;ing among a few familiar acquain|tance was thought no more of at the time: it &s;pread, however, &s;o much in the north (how, I never heard accounted for) and reached Town in &s;uch a manner, that Mr. Pelham thought it nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;ire Mr. Vane, who was a friend to Fo&s;&s;et and who
<PB N="231" REF="243">
employed him in his bu&s;ine&s;s, to write to Fo&s;&s;et, to know if he had &s;aid this of John|&s;on, and if he had, if it was true.</P>
<P>This letter was written on the 9th of January; it came to Newca&s;tle the Friday following. Fo&s;&s;et was much &s;urpri&s;ed, but the po&s;t going out in a few hours after its arrival, he immediately acknowledged the letter by a long, but not very explicit an&s;wer. This Friday happened to be the club-day of the neighbouring gentlemen at Newca&s;tle&mdash;as &s;oon as Lord Raven&s;|worth, who was a patron and employer of Fo&s;&s;et, came into the town, Fo&s;&s;et ac|quainted him with the extraordinary letter he had received: he told him, that he had already an&s;wered it, and being a&s;ked to &s;hew the copy, &s;aid he kept none; but de&s;ired Lord Raven&s;worth to recollect, if he held &s;uch a conver&s;ation at the Deanry of Durham, the day appointed for the birth-day. Raven&s;worth recollected no|thing at all of it. They went to the club together, and Raven&s;worth went the next morning to &s;ee his mother in the neigh|bourhood,
<PB N="232" REF="244">
with whom he &s;taid till Mon|day; but this thing, of &s;uch con&s;equence, lying upon his thoughts, he returned by Newca&s;tle. He and Fo&s;&s;et had another conver&s;ation, and in endeavouring to re|fre&s;h each other's memory about this dreadful delinquency of John&s;on, Fo&s;&s;et &s;aid, he could not recollect po&s;itively, at &s;uch a di&s;tance of time, whether John&s;on drank tho&s;e healths, or had been pre&s;ent at the drinking them, but that Murray and Stone had done both, &s;everal times. Raven&s;|worth was exce&s;&s;ively alarmed at this, with relation to Stone, on account of his office a|bout the Prince; and thus the affair of John|&s;on was quite forgotten, and the epi&s;ode be|came the principal part. There were ma|ny more conferences between Raven&s;worth and Fo&s;&s;et, upon this &s;ubject, in which the latter always per&s;i&s;ted, that Stone and Murray were pre&s;ent at the drinking, and did drink tho&s;e healths. It may be ob|&s;erved here, that, when he was examined upon oath, he &s;wore to the years 1731 or 1732 at late&s;t. Fo&s;&s;et comes up, as u&s;ual, about his law bu&s;ine&s;s, and is examined by

Me&s;&s;rs. Pelham and Vane, who never had heard of Murray or Stone being named: he is a&s;ked and an&s;wers, only with relation to John&s;on, never mentioning either of the others: but the love of his country, his King, and po&s;terity, burned &s;o &s;trongly in Raven&s;worth's bo&s;om, that he could have no re&s;t, till he had di&s;covered this enormity. Accordingly, when he came to town, he acquainted the mini&s;try and almo&s;t all his great friends with it, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the removal of Stone. The mini&s;try would have &s;lighted it, as it de|&s;erved, but, as he per&s;i&s;ted and had told &s;o many of it, they could not help laying it before the King, who, though he him&s;elf &s;lighted it, was advi&s;e$ to examine it, which examination produced this mo&s;t injudicious proceeding in Parliament. The Duke of De|von&s;hire was the only one of the commit|tee, who was ab&s;ent from the Hou&s;e. The mini&s;ters, and indeed, every body el$e, did imagine, and, I believe, &s;till do, that this whole affair is combined with the re&s;igna|tions, and that there was a &s;et of pretended friends to the Pelhams ready to take ad|vantage
<PB N="234" REF="246">
of it; and, I know, that Mr. Pel|ham did think that this motion would give great lights to it. How far their expecta|tions are an&s;wered, I cannot &s;ay; mine were entirely di&s;appointed, for the whole was &s;o ill conducted and &s;upported, that I &s;hould almo&s;t be tempted to believe, that the grounds, which carried our conjectures into a &s;ort of certainty, had no foundation at all.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29."

Lord Barnard thought writing of great con&s;equence, though, he &s;aid, Mr. Pelham did not. I replied, that Mr. Pel|ham mi&s;took him&s;elf; that no man was more &s;u&s;ceptible of its effects, and no man more ea&s;ily hurt by it: was there a &s;tronger proof of it, than the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e?

I was &s;orry for the &s;tep, becau&s;e I knew how naturally people were mi&s;led when they were hurt. Who could tell, what a man, that had been Secretary of State, might furni&s;h? and how galling it might be rendered by the able&s;t pen in England? That I was grieved to &s;ee &s;o little &s;pirit oppo&s;ed to &s;o much vehemence and viru|lence, as their declared enemies acted with; that their efficient enemies, it was true, were but few in number, but yet, they were the King's &s;on, and daughter, and a Duke of Bedford: that I thought the Pelhams had not three &s;uch efficient friends, in or out of St. James's: that my fears &s;ugge&s;ted, and rea&s;on confirmed me, that, if they did not exert them&s;elves, and give proofs of their power to the world, by their protection to their friends, num|bers would gradually drop from them:

that their all depended upon the new Par|liament: that I hoped they were active about it: that I had &s;ome little influence, as well as po&s;itive intere&s;t, in that election; but that I knew no more, what they were about, and how to apply that influence, than if I had never known their names: he was, however, to under&s;tand me, that the&s;e were the fears, not the complaints of a friend: that I meant no complaint, for that I had nothing to complain of: that I meant and a&s;ked the Pelhams' friend&s;hip and good-will, and in return offered them my &s;ervices and attachment: that Mr. Pelham was plea&s;ed to accept this offer, and to promi&s;e his friend&s;hip and counte|nance in return: that I never a&s;ked him for any emolument, at any time, or in any manner: that his Lord&s;hip knew, I had been reque&s;ted to do &s;o, but that I never would, having re&s;olved to leave it wholly to Mr. Pelham, how he thought proper to make u&s;e of my per&s;onal &s;ervices; tho&s;e, that were in my power, in my pre&s;ent &s;itu|$tion, I had promi&s;ed, and he &s;hould have them.

If he thought I could be of no further u&s;e, I could not help it; but if he thought I might, he would produce me in the way, in which he could be&s;t enable me to per|form it: that this was wholly Mr. Pel|ham's affair&mdash;it did not depend upon me; for what depended upon me, I &s;hould cer|tainly perform: that, therefore, though I de&s;ired he &s;hould know all this clearly and explicitly, yet I expected he &s;hould un|der&s;tand it, as it really was, the naked &s;entiments, only, and apprehen&s;ions of a friend, without any mixture of complaint, or having the lea&s;t intention to complain. I have forgotten to in&s;ert, in its place,

an in&s;tance of their timidity towards their friends, which I mentioned to Lord Bar|nard, and which is too &s;triking to be omit|ted. I a&s;ked his Lord&s;hip, how he thought our friend Murray felt, to find that his friends in power &s;uffered a mo&s;t offen&s;ive and hurtful calumny, meant at them al&s;o, to be fixed on him and made matter of ex|amination, in&s;tead of being rejected with indignation, by a Court the mo&s;t unpre|cedented, through the whole proceeding, that ever met! I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid I, you will tell me, that there were rea&s;ons that made it unavoidable: I know them, the Caven|di&s;hes would not &s;tand it, but leaned the other way. Stop here a moment&mdash;is not that &s;aying, let it hurt whom it will, let it be never &s;o inconvenient and le&s;&s;ening to you, we will not forfeit, nay, not ven|ture one atom of our credit with the herd. Murray conde&s;cends to defend him&s;elf; he treats calumny and clamour with the noble &s;pirit they de&s;erve, and artfully winds in an apology to them: they are then &s;atisfied. That is, after his having been the &s;ubject of an illegal enquiry into an impertinent,

di&s;graceful imputation, and not having the lea&s;t &s;peck appear upon him, the mini&s;try are &s;atisfied. To be &s;ure, Murray mu&s;t think him&s;elf greatly obliged to them. After all this, and when the &s;ame &s;candal was brought into the mo&s;t publick a&s;&s;embly, with the impotence of proof, in order to &s;pread it through the nation: what do his friends in power do? they &s;ay, he was ef|fectually ju&s;tified, without doing one act to &s;hew their re&s;entment of the per&s;ecution he had &s;uffered, either by di&s;gracing the abettors, or puni&s;hing the authors of it. How mu&s;t a mo&s;t able, active, openly at|tached friend feel &s;uch tamene&s;s! he re|plied, he thought (and I believe he did think) as I did. Mr. Pelham &s;poke to me at council, and told me that he had &s;een Lord Barnard, and that he thought him|&s;elf extremely obliged to me for what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, he &s;aid, he was highly &s;en&s;ible how much he owed me, and that he would &s;oon find an opportunity to talk with me at large.</P>

I &s;aid, that was a fault, and that &s;he ought to have them; that the mini&s;try, of late years, had been like children round a fire, telling &s;tories of &s;pirits, till they frightened one another, that they dared not look behind them&mdash;that it was become nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;he &s;hould give them cou|rage&mdash;that the people were very &s;olicitous to &s;ee &s;omething that looked, as if &s;he had a &s;hare in it, and that her &s;ecurity was con&s;idered&mdash;that I would not mention what was &s;aid, becau&s;e particular names were mentioned unfavourably.

I replied, that &s;he would be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, that &s;he would have the&s;e, and only the&s;e hands to work with, if &s;he continued as &s;he was; and it might create &s;ome difficulty to begin with tho&s;e where there was &s;o little corre&s;|pondence or connection.

<P><PB N="269" REF="281">He died about &s;ix o'clock on Wedne&s;day the 6th. Mr. Fox was at the Mar|quis of Hartington's before eight that morning. Negociations begun. The Duke of Devon&s;hire was &s;ent for, the &s;ame day: he came on Saturday night the 9th. I was informed that, as Mr. Fox was &s;upported by the Duke and the Prince&s;s Emily, to &s;ucceed Mr. Pelham, the plan to di&s;appoint him was, to refu&s;e the Trea&s;ury, but to offer him &s;omething that was better than the War Office; which they hoped and believed he would refu&s;e, and then to in|cen&s;e the King again&s;t him, and &s;hew him, that Fox would take nothing, that was compatible with the Duke of Newca&s;tle's remaining in power. This I was told, but could not figure to my&s;elf, what that &s;ome|thing was to be. On Monday the 11th, at night, by the intervention of Lord Har|tington, between the Duke of Newca&s;tle and Mr. Fox, the King agreed that the Duke of Newca&s;tle &s;hould be at the head of the Trea&s;ury, Mr. Legge Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Fox, Secretary of of State. I knew it early the next morn|ing,
<PB N="270" REF="282">
and finding <HI>that</HI> was the <HI>&s;omething</HI>, I thought it a &s;omething that mu&s;t ruin the Duke of Newca&s;tle. On Tue&s;day night, this was declared to the Cabinet Council. Wedne&s;day night, the 13th, Mr. Fox had a meeting with the Duke of Newca&s;tle, where, as it afterwards appeared, they dif|fered about the powers that he (Fox) was to be tru&s;ted with, in his office: for he under&s;tood, by Lord Hartington, that he was to have the direction of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and had acquainted me that morning, by Mr. Ellis, a Lord of the Ad|miralty, that he was to have the ab&s;olute direction of that Hou&s;e, but under the Duke of Newca&s;tle, and as his <HI>man</HI>, who was to remain in full power, with the whole confi|dence and &s;ecret of the King. But finding, at this conference with the Duke of New|ca&s;tle, that either this was not meant; or, that he was not to be tru&s;ted with &s;ufficient powers to execute it properly, they parted di&s;&s;atisfied; and the following morning, Thur&s;day the 14th, Fox wrote to the Duke to be excu&s;ed from accepting the &s;eals of Secretary. This news I heard at dinner,
<PB N="271" REF="283">
and was much &s;urpri&s;ed at it, as was the the whole town. One &s;ide &s;ays, he u&s;ed, and wrote the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, to get the &s;eals: he &s;ays, that he only offered, as he really meant, to &s;erve ab&s;olutely un|der the Duke of Newca&s;tle, and only re|quired &s;ufficient powers to be able to do it in the Hou&s;e, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Ellis came to me, with the avowal<MILESTONE N="15." UNIT="Mar."> of Mr. Fox, to give me the material part of this account, adding that, as a proof of what Mr. Fox meant, he in&s;tanced Mr. Craggs being Lord Sunderland's man, when he had the Trea&s;ury, and was in full power with the late King&mdash;and al&s;o, that he had declared to the Duke of Newca&s;tle, that he never de&s;ired to touch a penny of the &s;ecret-&s;ervice money, or to know the di&s;|po&s;ition of it, farther than was nece&s;&s;ary to enable him to &s;peak to the members, with|out appearing ridiculous. He ended with &s;trong a&s;&s;urances of Mr. Fox's regard and friend&s;hip to me, and his de&s;ires of having mine in return:&mdash;this very &s;trong.</P>

<P>I proceeded to the article of Bridge|water, which I &s;aid was thus&mdash;Long after my mutual engagements with Mr. Pelham, when Lord Egmont made that unfriendly attempt, Mr. Pelham a&s;ked me, what would become of it?

He &s;aid, no, to be &s;ure; and hinted, be&s;ides his publick oppo&s;ition, great di&s;ta&s;te to him per&s;onally, as if &s;ome|thing very di&s;honourable had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween

Some time after that, he told me that the King a&s;ked him, if he &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;igned to endeavour to keep Lord Egmont out of Bridgewater, having been told that it would be a matter of &s;ome trouble and expence&mdash;Mr. Pelham replied, that he could not &s;peak to his Maje&s;ty with any authority, but he thought, I would: that I de&s;ired him, when next tho&s;e mat|ters came to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, to lay me at the King's feet, and tell him, that as I found it would be agreeable to his Maje&s;ty, I would &s;pare neither pains nor expence to exclude him: that thus it became my en|gagement to do it, if I can. That the&s;e were the engagements on my &s;ide with his brother. He &s;aw, that I had not di|mini&s;hed them, and I was fully determined to perform them, let what would fall out on the other &s;ide. The Duke was very &s;erious, and dejected, during the whole
<PB N="277" REF="289">
conver&s;ation, and threw in &s;everal warm expre&s;&s;ions of approbation, and then &s;aid, that he was loaded with too many things at once, for one man to bear: that he had &s;een, and his brother had told him, how hand&s;ome my proceedings had been: that this was the mo&s;t noble, that could be imagined: that he had tran&s;actions with many, but none like this, and beg'd me to &s;ay, what his brother had engaged to do; and to tell him all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and how I under&s;tood it. I &s;aid, I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed; I could not talk about advantages to my|&s;elf, that were to take their ri&s;e from my own a&s;&s;ertion only, when there was nobody to contradict me: I was afraid, he would have enough of that from others: it was &s;ufficient that he was &s;atisfied, that I had not whittled down the obligations which I was to perform. He pre&s;&s;ed me &s;till more &s;trongly; till I told him, that I would not talk of it at all, without remind|ing him, that I was ab&s;olutely determined to fulfil all the engagements I had taken, and repeated to him, without any regard to what might be done on the other &s;ide:
<PB N="278" REF="290">
that it was the la&s;t tran&s;action of my life, and therefore &s;hould &s;uffer no ambiguity: they were too far gone to admit of any al|teration; let what would happen, I could not refine them away; I thought my&s;elf bound by them, and would, at all events, perform them: that my proceeding mu&s;t be as open and clear to the memory of his brother with him, as they would have been with his brother, if we had had the misfortune to lo&s;e his Grace: that, even on this footing, I had very little to &s;ay; for I was &s;ure, he mu&s;t know that his brother was to remove the per&s;onal mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions that I lay under, with the King, at a proper time, and to bring me into the &s;ervice, in a proper manner: that I never thought of fixing him down to a particular day, or a particular office, becau&s;e indeed I meant more, I meant to come in, &s;o as to live with them as an humble friend, under their friend&s;hip and protection. He &s;aid, very &s;eriou&s;ly and warmly, that he would never a&s;&s;ert any thing as done, that he was not &s;ure, was done; but as to the King's di&s;|like, we might wave that, It was impo&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="279" REF="291">
but <HI>that</HI> mu&s;t give way; it could not with&s;tand &s;uch a behaviour as mine: we might put it out of the que&s;tion, with two or three &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions more, to that purpo&s;e. He then a&s;ked me, if his bro|ther had engaged to bring me in, before the elections were over. I &s;aid, he had made me no &s;uch promi&s;e, that I had never bar|tered with him, &s;o as to pin him down to a day or an hour, my views being to obtain their friend&s;hip, &amp;c. as I had before ex|plained to him. He &s;aid, he always un|der&s;tood it &s;o, and a&s;ked me; as there would be many changes, and that they were obliged to cut the cloth into as many pieces as they could, if I thought, I could come in before the election. I &s;aid, I did think I could. He replied, he knew I might be tru&s;ted, and would talk very freely to me, and tell me how things &s;tood, &s;ince I &s;aid, I thought I could come in now: that the Secretary's office was &s;ettled, and that he had four po&s;itive engagements, which were to Lords Hill&s;borough, Dupplin, Barring|ton, and Mr. Nugent: but that he had not, and would not promi&s;e any one of
<PB N="280" REF="292">
them, till it was done and &s;ettled with the King. He then expatiated on the King's kindne&s;s to him, which, however, he at|tributed great part of to the exigencies of the times: that his Maje&s;ty had advi&s;ed him not to promi&s;e, and that he replied, that he &s;hould take great care not to have him&s;elf quoted again&s;t him&s;elf. I &s;aid, I under&s;tood that the Secretary's office was de&s;igned for Sir Thomas Robin&s;on. He &s;aid, yes, and that for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Northern Province, [N. B. He is to have the Southern Province] no man in England under&s;tood it better; that he was not hap|py at explaining him&s;elf, but no man knew more, or had better under&s;tanding. I &s;aid, I knew him very well, he was a worthy man, and I loved him. I &s;aid, what if I came into the place he left? He con&s;idered a little, and &s;aid, very well, pray go on. I &s;aid, I would particularly &s;upport him in the Hou&s;e, <HI>where</HI> he would chiefly want it. He &s;aid, he knew he would. I &s;aid, there is my old place, Trea&s;urer of the Navy; that mu&s;t be vacant: I &s;hould like that better than any thing. But, I added, why
<PB N="281" REF="293">
&s;hould I enter into the&s;e things, I leave it wholly to your Grace. He &s;aid, that, by a &s;trange fatality, the direction of the Hou&s;e of Commons was fallen upon him, who had never thought of it; and he mu&s;t expect, that the great attempt would be, to &s;hew that he could not direct it: there|fore he could not chu&s;e by affection, but mu&s;t comply with tho&s;e who could &s;up|port him <HI>there</HI>. I &s;aid, I under&s;tood &s;o, and that I thought, I might pretend to &s;ome abilities that way: that in the op|po&s;ition, I was thought of &s;ome u&s;e there: that in Court indeed, I never undertook much, becau&s;e he knew I never was &s;up|ported: but now, when I &s;hould be &s;up|ported, I hoped I might pretend to be as u&s;eful there, as my neighbours. He &s;aid, it was inconte&s;tably &s;o. I &s;aid, that I would derogate from nobody, but con&s;idering the &s;uperiority of age, the offices I had gone through, and my rank in the world; and adding to that, chu&s;ing &s;ix members for them at my own great expence, without the expence of one &s;hilling from their &s;ide, I thought the world in general, and even
<PB N="282" REF="294">
the gentlemen them&s;elves, could not ex|pect that their preten&s;ions &s;hould give me the exclu&s;ion. He &s;aid, that what I did, was very great&mdash;that he often thought with &s;urpri&s;e, at the ea&s;e and cheapne&s;s of the election at Weymouth&mdash;that they had no|thing like it. I &s;aid, I believed there were few who could give his Maje&s;ty &s;ix mem|bers for nothing. He &s;aid, he reckoned five, and had put down five to my account. I &s;aid it was &s;o; but this attempt of Lord Egmont's made it &s;ix&mdash;he would ob&s;erve, that I did not pretend to chu&s;e two for Bridgewater: but by Lord Egmont's op|po&s;ition, the two members mu&s;t be entirely owing to me; for if I did not exert my whole force to exclude him, he mu&s;t come in, and the Court would have but one there. He thanked me, &s;aid it was mo&s;t clear as it was now explained, but he had not con&s;idered it in that light. I &s;aid, I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed from talking any more about my&s;elf: that I left it entirely to him, and to the King; that I was fully deter|mined to make this &s;acrifice to his Maje&s;ty; let him u&s;e me as he plea&s;ed: that I would
<PB N="283" REF="295">
keep out of the way of a per&s;onal affront: that I knew I had given no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, but that I would not ju&s;tify with his Maje&s;ty&mdash;that it was enough that he was di&s;plea&s;ed, to make me think that I was in the wrong, and to beg him to forget it: I would not even be in the right again&s;t him, and I was very &s;ure, I would never again be in the wrong again&s;t him, for which I hoped his Grace would be my caution. He &s;aid, he would with all his heart. He took me in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ed me twice, with &s;trong a&s;&s;urances of affec|tion and &s;ervice. I told him, I would go to Mr. Ellis, and acquaint him with his nomination to Weymouth; he de&s;ired I would, and from him tell him, that he agreed to his brother's nomination, but not to &s;ay any thing by way of compliment.</P>

he had no intimacy with him, but was told them by his bo&s;om friend Mr. George Grenville, who was al&s;o his: that, indeed, if Mr. Pitt meant money, I might well think, he ought to be &s;atisfied; but, his pa&s;&s;ion was not money; it was ambi|tion, power; of which he had no &s;hare.

Lord Dupplin &s;aid, he knew that Mr. Pelham, for more than a year before he died, looked upon our union to be as &s;ettled, as any connection he had, and always added, tha$ I was the only man of bu&s;ine&s;s they had, and he was re&s;olved to attach me to them. I replied that, though I had not &s;aid &s;o much to the Duke, Mr. Pelham declared that I had a good deal of marketable war$ (parliamentary intere&s;t) and that, if I would empower him to offer it all to the King without conditions, he would be an&s;wera|ble to bring the affair to a good account that, if this engagement had not been taken

the nature of the thing plainly &s;poke it. Service is obligation, obligation implies return. Could any man of honour profe&s;s friend&s;hip, accept the offers of his friend's whole &s;ervices, &s;uffer tho&s;e &s;ervices to be carried into execution, avail him&s;elf of their whole utility, and then tell that friend, he could not, or he would not make him any return? Could there be &s;uch a charac|ter? Suppo&s;ing this gentleman had a ma&s;|ter, who&s;e affairs were promoted by the&s;e &s;ervices, the concurrence of whom was nece&s;&s;ary to this return, but who was in|di&s;po&s;ed to his friend; could he an&s;wer it to his friend or to the world, when he found his ma&s;ter's re&s;entments irremovea|ble, if he did not advi&s;e his friend to take back his offers, and apply them as he might think be&s;t, unle&s;s he cho&s;e to ri&s;que them on an adventure, for the performance of which he could not be an&s;werable? The&s;e things &s;poke them&s;elves, and all mankind mu&s;t &s;ee them in the &s;ame light: that, be it how it would, it mu&s;t be thoroughly under&s;tood by the world&mdash;If this con|nection, and the acceptance of my effectual

I found means to repeat this particular de|duction and conclu&s;ion, two, or three times, in the &s;ub&s;equent conver&s;ation. We then fell upon Bridgewater&mdash;the Duke of New|ca&s;tle would do every thing to &s;upport the party: he demurred upon petitioning, only, for fear of making it an handle for forming an improper connection at &s;etting out. I knew that tho&s;e in con&s;iderable places dif|fered among them&s;elves, and almo&s;t all di&s;|owned immediate dependence, obligation and allegiance to the Duke, and that they might, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, perplex and di&s;turb his Grace. I &s;aid, I under&s;tood him, and after having &s;trongly repre&s;ented to him that, what I undertook, I had per|formed, &s;ince he acknowledged I was fairly cho&s;en: that I meant it a &s;ervice; if they were &s;atisfied, I was: if they de&s;ired to make effectual, what their own dependents

had ob&s;tructed, I would give my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but that I was wholly unconcerned in their determination: I added, that I did not think this ca&s;e was liable to the inconve|niencies which he had mentioned: for that I had rea&s;on to think, that Mr. Fox would not e&s;pou&s;e, even privately, Lord Egmont again&s;t me, though I had not &s;een him &s;ince my return from the We&s;t. That I had been pre&s;&s;ed by &s;everal with offers of &s;er|vice, to know if I would petition, that the Grenvilles, &amp;c. had given me to under|&s;tand, that they would not only be for me, but actively &s;o: that I would own to him in confidence, that I my&s;elf wi&s;hed there might be no petition: that the Duke might think it no ill bargain, if he could <HI>get</HI> Lord Egmont, by &s;uffering him to &s;it only, with|out any farther preten&s;ions upon his Grace, and, perhaps, I might think &s;o too: but I thought it impracticable; for if I was in his Grace's confidence, I &s;hould be obliged to tell him, that, if Lord Egmont &s;ub&s;cribed to that bargain, when the fourteen days for petitioning were expired, if the Duke did not engage to gratify his Lord&s;hip (which
<PB N="312" REF="324">
would be no ea&s;y matter) the fifteenth day, it was my opinion, that he would break with his Grace on the &s;ixteenth. Lord Dupplin &s;aid much of Lord Egmont's fal&s;ene&s;s and ill behaviour to Mr. Pelham, who told him, that he was &s;o gro&s;s a flat|terer, when he brought him in for Weo|bly, that it was quite &s;hocking, and Mr. Pelham &s;hewed him a letter from Lord Egmont, in which he writes, that he was happy in having found a man, in whom he he could have an <HI>implicit faith</HI>, with a great deal more of this kind. He then entered into the means of managing this affair of Bridgewater. I &s;aid, I could &s;ay but little to it, after what I had &s;aid; that my being in their confidence, or not, mu&s;t and would chiefly decide of the complexion of that bu&s;ine&s;s. He replied, he always looked upon that as done, and to be &s;ure, that mu&s;t be decided, before any mea&s;ures could be taken with effect. I told him, that one way came acro&s;s me, and only one, to make all things ea&s;y, but charged him, as a man of honour, never to mention it, as a thought or &s;ugge&s;tion of mine; becau&s;e it was not

&s;o much as my wi&s;h, and the &s;ugge&s;tion might be con&s;trued to imply the wi&s;h: that the expedient was, if any thing &s;hould happen, or be formed, to make room for me in the &s;ervice, before the meeting of Parliament, that would vacate my &s;eat, and I could neither petition nor &s;tand for Bridgewater&mdash;but I enjoined him never to mention this (for it &s;truck him much, and made him, for a few minutes, very thought+ful) as coming from me, for I really meant it, only as a plea&s;antry, between him and me, that ro&s;e on a &s;udden.</P>
<P>I went to town to &s;ee Lord Dupplin,<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="July"> about the Bridgewater bu&s;ine&s;s. He &s;aid, he had told the Duke of Newca&s;tle all that had pa&s;&s;ed between us, and had explained the nature of the friend&s;hip I offered, in contradi&s;tinction to the inconnection and inconfidence of others in office: that the Duke approved of, and de&s;ired it, and meant to affect it; that he pre&s;&s;ed his Grace to end it with the King; for when the pro|&s;cription was taken off, and the King had accepted me, the Duke might then declare,
<PB N="314" REF="326">
that I was in his confidence, and under his protection, and that he was at liberty, and would do me ju&s;tice, the fir&s;t opportunity that might happen: and then he (Lord Dupplin) could have the plea&s;ure of com|municating every thing, he knew and heard, confidentially to me, and &s;hould con&s;ider me and him&s;elf, and the Attorney and Stone, (which la&s;t was pre&s;ent when he talked to the Duke) as one per&s;on. I &s;aid, I could not imagine any rea&s;on why Stone &s;hould be indi&s;po&s;ed towards me. He cried, in|di&s;po&s;ed! very much the contrary; he de|&s;ires it greatly, and &s;o do all the Duke of Newca&s;tle's friends. I replied, if it ended otherwi&s;e, it would be the mo&s;t &s;candalous tran&s;action that ever appeared to the world, and appear it mu&s;t. He &s;aid, it could not end ill&mdash;he looked upon it as done, for he de&s;ired me to ob&s;erve, that the Duke did not hold up the King at all, or &s;o much as in&s;inuate that he apprehended any difficulty from his Maje&s;ty. I beg'd Lord Dupplin to pre&s;s the Duke to make an end of it, be|fore I went into the We&s;t, and that I would

<P>I went to the Duke of Newca&s;tle's. Af|ter<MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="July"> his Grace had talked indeci&s;ively about Bridgewater, of which I gave him the hear|ing, I de&s;ired to know po&s;itively, what I was to expect: he replied, and told me, that he had laid all my &s;ervices before the King in the fulle&s;t manner, but it did not &s;atisfy him: that his Maje&s;ty endeavoured to le&s;&s;en my credit at Weymouth&mdash;that the Duke replied, that he thought his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf had told him, that the borough was put into my hands, at the renewal of of the charter, on condition of his naming two members for that time only. The King could not deny it; but upon the whole, he would not receive me to any mark of his favour. I &s;aid, that, as it was &s;o, I received his Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure with that re&s;pect and re&s;ignation, which became me towards my Sovereign: that, after &s;uch offers received, and &s;uffered to be carried into execution, at the expence of nearly 4000<HI>l.</HI> I did not believe &s;uch a con|clu&s;ion

The Duke expre&s;&s;ed much &s;orrow; prote&s;ted the &s;incerity of his endeavours, and &s;aid, that what would not do one day might do another. I replied, that I could not judge of that; but if he imagined, that I would remain po&s;tulating among the common herd of &s;uitors, and expo&s;e my&s;elf to &s;uffer twenty unwor|thy preferences more, to get, perhaps, no|thing at la&s;t, certainly nothing that I wanted, &mdash;it was impo&s;&s;ible; I would as &s;oon wear a livery, and ride behind a coach in the &s;treets.

I a&s;ked, if that was not a virtual union. Lord Hill&s;borough replied, 'twas near it: Mr. Pelham had the addre&s;s to play the one again&s;t the other; but the Duke had not. He had had &s;ome talk with the Duke about this, who told him, all would go well, let them do the duty of their offices. The Duke &s;aid, he had informed the King, that he had not much to expect from his fir&s;t rank in the Hou&s;e of Commons (meaning Fox, Pitt, Legge, Grenville) but that he had an ex|cellent &s;econd rank (meaning him (Hill&s;|borough,) Barrington, Dupplin, Nugent, Charles Town&s;hend, &amp;c.)

as the Duke of Newca&s;tle at the head of affairs, even for an hour, either now or then.

<PB N="325" REF="337">
and experience in bu&s;ine&s;s was: that the Duke of Newca&s;tle had the ball at his foot, when his brother died, and he might have made a la&s;ting and advantageous &s;ettle|ment for him&s;elf and the country, but he had not endeavoured to oblige one efficient man, be&s;ides his known enemies: that there was no violence, no oppre&s;&s;ion, no particular complaint, and yet the nation was &s;inking by degrees, and there was a general indi&s;po&s;ition proceeding from the weakne&s;s and worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the mini&s;ter, who would embrace every thing, and was fit for nothing. She an&s;wered, that &s;he was glad to hear me &s;ay that the nation had &s;till great re&s;ources&mdash;for people told her it was undone&mdash;but &s;he did not think &s;o, yet, if there were both re&s;ources and parts too, and they could not both be exerted, what would they avail? She &s;aw, and much la|mented the con&s;uming &s;tate of the nation, which I mentioned: it was of infinite con&s;equence how a young reign began, and it made her very unea&s;y. She was highly &s;en&s;ible how nece&s;&s;ary it was, that the Prince &s;hould keep company with men:

&s;he well knew that women could not i$+form him, but if it was in her power ab+&s;olutely, to whom could &s;he addre&s;s him&punc; What company could &s;he wi&s;h him to keep What friend&s;hips de&s;ire he &s;hould contract&punc; Such was the univer&s;al profligacy, &s;uch th$ character and conduct of the young peopl$ of di&s;tinction, that &s;he was really afraid t$ have them near her children.

Something &s;hould be thought of, and &s;oon&mdash;the &s;um|mer was the time, the winter was not &s;o proper for concerting mea&s;ures.

She men|tioned two things, which were remarkable from the inferences: the fir&s;t, talking of what the Duke of Newca&s;tle ought to do; but then, &s;ays &s;he, he will &s;ay, the <HI>party</HI> will not come into it; the <HI>party</HI>, this; and the <HI>party</HI>, that: but I could never under&s;tand what the party was; I have endeavoured to learn, and I could never find, that the party was any thing el&s;e, but the Duke of De|von&s;hire, and his &s;on, and old Horace Wal|pole. The Duke of Devon&s;hire was the cau&s;e of the Duke of Cumberland's being in the Regency this time, and he in&s;i&s;ted upon his being left &s;ole Regent, at a meet|ing, where were the Duke of Newca&s;tle, the Lord Chancellor, the Duke of Grafton, Lord Waldegrave, and old Horace Walpole. The &s;econd was, on my commending the Prince's figure, and &s;aying he was much
<PB N="329" REF="341">
taller than the King, &s;he replied, yes, he was taller than his uncle. I &s;aid, in height it might be &s;o, but if they mea&s;ured round, the Duke had the advantage of him. She an&s;wered, it was true, but &s;he hoped it was the only advantage that he, ever, would have of him.</P>
<P>In the half hour between her Royal Highne&s;s's dre&s;&s;ing and dinner, Mr. Cre&s;&s;et did me the favour to come to me, and to my very great &s;urpri&s;e, entered, at once, into the wretched management and inabilities of the Duke of Newca&s;tle: he repeated what the Prince&s;s had before &s;aid, and added, the mon&s;trous expence of the pre&s;ent armament, and yet in&s;ufficient; it was well made by tho&s;e who had it in charge, when they were permitted to act; but it was infinitely blameable in the Mi|ni&s;ter, who delayed that permi&s;&s;ion &s;o long, and thereby occa&s;ioned this va&s;t, unnece&s;|&s;ary expence in arming. Why not be pre|pared, or at lea&s;t forward in your prepara|tions, in the autumn? Then every thing might have been done completely, and at

the u&s;ual expence. It was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tand as it was&mdash;for the &s;ame would happen, when the war came upon the Continent in Europe&mdash;Hanover mu&s;t be protected, but it would be in the &s;ame way; a number of expen&s;ive, u&s;ele&s;s engagements entered into in a hurry, too great for the country to bear, and yet, by that hurry, ineffectual to the end, which might be attained by a rea&s;onable plan and upon rea&s;onable terms. Ju&s;t &s;o, was the la&s;t war, ruinous in the expence, and un&s;ucce&s;sful in the end, for want of con&s;ideration and a rea&s;onable plan at the beginning. But it was ea&s;ily &s;een, that <HI>all was going one way:</HI> that it was a &s;ad pro&s;pect for tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to the Prince: that the poor Prince&s;s was very unea&s;y about it.</P>
<P>&rindx;All this is &s;o; and it is as certain, that the Duke is full as much indi&s;po&s;ed to the Duke of Newca&s;tle as the Prince&s;s; and the amount of all will be&mdash;<HI>Nothing</HI>.</P>

the King; all avowedly hate and de&s;|pi&s;e the Duke of Newca&s;tle. The King delegates his power to him. The Prince&s;s and the Duke, (from trifling di&s;likes in my opinion) and the principal people in em|ployment, from this &s;trange &s;ituation of the Royal family, and from great unwil|lingne&s;s to venture their emoluments, can|not unite in bringing about the <HI>&s;ingle thing</HI> in which, perhaps, they all agree.

<P>During a vi&s;it at Horton for two days,<MILESTONE N="29." UNIT="May"> I had much conver&s;ation with Lord Halli|fax. We entirely agreed in the in&s;ufficiency, fal&s;ene&s;s, and meanne&s;s of the Duke of Newca&s;tle's admini&s;tration: and we much lamented the imminent nece&s;&s;ity of the contrary conduct, in the pre&s;ent dangerous &s;tate of our country. The remedy we could not find, though we agreed that neither the Duke nor the country could go on, without other management or other hands. I advi&s;ed his Lord&s;hip to think of it &s;e|riou&s;ly. He &s;aid, the Duke of Newca&s;tle
<PB N="332" REF="344">
was his near relation; he wi&s;hed him well, had &s;erved him hone&s;tly, had a&s;&s;erted the rights of his own office, but had entered into no cabals again&s;t him: that the Duke had &s;ometimes u&s;ed him kindly, and &s;ome|times, otherwi&s;e; had &s;ometimes obliged him, and, &s;ometimes, granted in &s;uch a manner not to oblige: that he had frankly told his Grace all this, and had pre&s;&s;ed upon him, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to pro|ceed with the&s;e hands, obliged as he might think them; but di&s;obliged, as they them|&s;elves thought, or, at lea&s;t, profe&s;&s;ed to think: that he would pre&s;s him again, though without hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. Lord Hallifax owned, he &s;aw nothing to help the Duke, but my friends, Talbot and Da&s;hwood, and me. I &s;aid, that I did not know how he could gain us, unle&s;s he could &s;hew us a real intention to extricate this country from the di&s;tre&s;s, he him&s;elf had &s;o much contributed to bring upon it; and then, that he (Hallifax) &s;hould have the &s;eals, with &s;ufficient authority to carry tho&s;e intentions into execution, or el&s;e, that he would engage with us to force his
<PB N="333" REF="345">
Grace to a compliance. He then added, that he had repre&s;ented the u&s;age he had met with, to the Duke, both as his near relation and his friend&mdash;The unworthy preferences&mdash;Lord Holderne&s;s, incapable &mdash;then, Mr. Fox&mdash;then. Sir Thomas Ro|bin&s;on, every way mo&s;t unfit&mdash;his making Mr. Fox of the Cabinet, which he before, had refu&s;ed him, under pretence that the King would not con&s;ent to it&mdash;his allow|ing Mr. Pitt's claim to the &s;eals of Secre|tary, by making excu&s;es, and laying it wholly upon the King's di&s;like&mdash;his ex|pre&s;&s;ing much alienation to Me&s;&s;rs. Pitt, Fox, and the Grenvilles, on account of the arrogance of the fir&s;t, and of the fal&s;ene&s;s and cunning of the &s;econd, who would deceive the Duke of Newca&s;tle by pretend|ing to be his friend. I &s;aid, that the Duke would deceive him&s;elf, for Mr. Fox did not pretend to do it, and would be &s;orry to have it thought &s;o, as he had declared, he neither had, nor would have any obliga|tion to him. But that it behoved him (Hallifax) not to acquie&s;ce under the pre|ten&s;ions of either; for, by that means, they
<PB N="334" REF="346">
would become realities again&s;t him, and, in ca&s;e of any alterations (which appeared unavoidable) they would acquire a foun|dation, if not &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;aid, that, un|le&s;s the Duke of Newca&s;tle made a new &s;y&s;tem, he could not go on; but if tho&s;e &s;hould &s;ucceed, it would be a very flim&s;y and &s;hort admini&s;tration, for neither the nation, nor the people of quality would confide in either of them. Lord Hallifax added, that he had felt the danger of &s;uf|fering tho&s;e groundle&s;s preten&s;ions to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, but knew not how to prevent them&mdash;and therefore he had told the Duke of Newca&s;tle, that, &s;ince he &s;aw his Grace would not tru&s;t him in bu&s;ine&s;s, and was continually putting people before him, he expected &s;ome mark of di&s;tinction, and de|manded the Garter: that the Duke boggled at it, and &s;aid Lord Carli&s;le was to have it: that Lord Northumberland in&s;i&s;ted upon it: that he would do his be&s;t, but that he (Hallifax) had no friend at Court but him|&s;elf. To which Lord Hallifax replied, he did no know what his Grace meant by that&mdash;that, indeed, he never thought it
<PB N="335" REF="347">
nece&s;&s;ary to apply to whores and knaves; but, in &s;hort, he mu&s;t have it, or quit his office&mdash;he did not care it &s;hould appear to be done in a pique for both their &s;akes, and therefore de&s;ired the Duke would pro|po&s;e it, and in&s;i&s;t upon it, to the King; and if his Maje&s;ty ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed it, that the Duke, upon honour, would tell him &s;o, and he would then take a proper time to quit the &s;ervice, which would pre|vent its appearing to the world, that the Duke had not the power of a Mini&s;ter, or that he him&s;elf had laid down out of re|&s;entment. The Duke &s;aid, he would not for the world draw &s;uch a thing upon his Maje&s;ty, but that he would do his be&s;t to &s;erve him. I &s;aid, I wi&s;hed he had put his weight rather upon a &s;hare of government, and a power to &s;erve his country at this exigence. He replied, it was nothing; he was per&s;uaded that the Duke had never mentioned it to the King. He te&s;tified much kindne&s;s and prote&s;tations of friend|&s;hip, and de&s;ires to unite and act with me and mine. He al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the Duke tru&s;ted the Chancellor no more than him,
<PB N="336" REF="348">
and &s;uffered difference of opinion from him as impatiently.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30." UNIT="May">I had a long conver&s;ation with Lord Temple, who took great pains to per&s;uade me, that they were all very well &s;atisfied with Mr. Fox; though to jealous minds there might be pretence for &s;u&s;picion, from the appearances and the con&s;equences of their different conduct: they are de&s;perate with the King, and have not yet been able to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, either of Leice&s;ter Hou&s;e or of the Duke of Cumberland.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="June">Mr. Fox &s;pent the morning with me. We had a good deal of talk to no purpo&s;e. None of them dare come to any re&s;olution. He was a&s;&s;ured by the Duke of Argyll, that Stone was not well with the Prince&s;s. He heard by We&s;t, that the Duke of New|ca&s;tle, upon We&s;t's pre&s;&s;ing him to make up with him (Fox), &s;aid, that Stone was always advi&s;ing the &s;ame thing, and had lo&s;t him&s;elf at his own court on that ac|count. He &s;aid, that the Duke was with the Prince&s;s on the 22d in&s;tant, and pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="337" REF="349">
to her, taking the Prince with him to Port&s;mouth; which &s;he approved of, and de&s;ired him to a&s;k the Prince him&s;elf&mdash;he did &s;o, and the Prince agreed to it, but not with &s;o much eagerne&s;s as might be ex|pected. On Monday, Lord Waldegrave &s;ent word he would wait on the Duke to &s;ettle the journey on Tue&s;day morning; but, in the mean time, the Prince&s;s had altered her opinion and &s;ent to put it off, on pretence it might give umbrage to the King. Fox refines and is much di&s;&s;atisfied with this tran&s;action: the Duke does not, and &s;ays it is only from a re&s;olution &s;he has taken, not to be accountable for any thing with his Maje&s;ty. But Fox is very unea&s;y, and very &s;olicitous to unite the Duke and the Prince&s;s, which is the only &s;ure ground; but I think it will be exceed|ingly difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible to effect.</P>
<P>Lord Hallifax told me, that the Duke of<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="July"> Newca&s;tle had mentioned his re&s;olution of coming to &s;ome &s;ettlement: that Mr. Pitt did not ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;t upon being Secre|tary; but that there was a great unwilling|ne&s;s
<PB N="338" REF="350">
to &s;peak out: that he (Hallifax) did not wonder at it. If the Duke was not in earne&s;t, why did he &s;end him &s;uch po&s;itive terms or de&s;ire a conference? Could he think, that Pitt would open him&s;elf upon hints, and to &s;uch a me&s;&s;enger as Mr. Yorke? That the Duke, in a former con|ference, had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, "how much concern it gave him, that I &s;hould make a &s;peech again&s;t him&mdash;his re&s;olution to make up with me&mdash;enquiries when I went into Dor&s;et&s;hire, and that, in this conference, he cried out of him&s;elf, we mu&s;t have Dod|dington." Thus far Lord Hallifax&mdash;and to render intelligible what follows, and may follow, with relation to Mr, Pitt, I will throw out what I know of his &s;ituation all together. His extraordinary conver&s;a|tion with Mr. Fox, at Lord Hill&s;borough's, may be &s;een under May 9th. The other conference at Holland Hou&s;e, though &s;omewhat more courtly, was not more &s;a|tisfactory, and has never been renewed. It &s;eems that, a little before the King went to Hanover, old Horace Walpole, either officiou&s;ly, or being &s;ent, tried to bring
<PB N="339" REF="351">
Mr. Pitt into temper, with hints that the Duke of Newca&s;tle de&s;ired it, and would have done every thing in his power to &s;erve him according to his wi&s;hes, and therefore he mu&s;t not be inflexible, &amp;c. Pitt re|plied, he was not, and did not in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;eals now, but would be contented, as a proof of the Duke's &s;incerity, if he would take off all marks of pro&s;cription, that the King &s;hould agree that, when any va|cancy happened, he &s;hould have the &s;eals, and &s;hould, in the mean time, treat him upon that foot. In this way, he would not de&s;ire any vacancy &s;hould be made for him. Old Horace &s;eemed to give into this; and here, let me in&s;ert, that Fox had heard from Lord Hartington, who was informed by old Horace him&s;elf, that the Duke of Newca&s;tle was very angry with Horace, for having advanced &s;o far, and &s;aid, he had gone farther than his commi&s;&s;ion, or than the Duke could go, if he would, or would go, if he could. Then came on the&s;e extraordinary conferences, which, I confe&s;s, I do not yet under&s;tand. I know Mr. Fox imputes it to a de&s;ign of Pitt,
<PB N="340" REF="352">
to fix him&s;elf with the Prince&s;s, and that, <MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="July">in order to do it, it became nece&s;&s;ary to de|clare off with him, as the Duke of Cum|berland's man. But I do not think &s;o; it is too refined for me, as nobody but Cre&s;|&s;et (if he is) is in a &s;ettled confidence of mea&s;ures with the Prince&s;s, and &s;o I told him.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate then, I &s;uppo&s;e, Mr. Yorke &s;ound Mr. Pitt, when he appeared &s;o cold, as the Duke repre&s;ented him to Lord Hal|lifax, when he &s;ounded him by his Grace's order. But the real overture and an&s;wer was, as Mr. James Grenville told me, from Mr. Pitt in effect, (though not avowedly) great a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip and affection&mdash;re|&s;olution to bring about every thing he wi&s;hed, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;de&s;irous that they might talk together, and they &s;hould &s;oon agree, &amp;c.&mdash;this was not by po&s;itive me&s;&s;age, but by in&s;inuation. The an&s;wer was, that as to friend&s;hip and confidence, that was entirely over; it was lo&s;s of time to talk any more in that &s;tyle: that if even tho&s;e a&s;&s;urances were to be carried into
<PB N="341" REF="353">
execution and were realities, it was a doubt whether they would be accepted: that he would not take, nor hold any thing as a favour from the Duke of Newca&s;tle, nor ever will owe him any obligation: that therefore he &s;aw no u&s;e in meetings or con|ferences. But if the Duke was really in earne&s;t, and meant any thing, why did he not propo&s;e plainly the three things&mdash;What was the work he expected to be done? Who were the gentlemen he propo&s;ed to do it? And in what &s;tations he de&s;igned them to act? When he, Pitt, was clearly informed of tho&s;e three points, he &s;hould be able to give an an&s;wer, after he had con|&s;ulted his friends, gentlemen of honour and efficiency, whether it was to be under|taken or not, and upon what terms.</P>
<P>I dined with the Duke of Argyll at Mr.<MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="July"> Fox's. When the company was gone, Fox told me, he was &s;ure that Mr. Pitt had made up with the Prince&s;s, and had it in view, when he declared off with him: that he had long cultivated (above &s;ix months) an acquaintance with one, no way
<PB N="342" REF="354">
connected with the Duke of Newca&s;tle, with whom he had had the fir&s;t confidential conference, &s;ince he &s;aw me: that Pitt in talking of things of that court, I think he called it his court, to that per&s;on, he &s;aid he had heard that Stone was not &s;o well there as u&s;ual: what could be the rea&s;on of it? The per&s;on an&s;wered, &s;hall I tell you? I fear you will not like it; but as you command me, I will tell you. I take it to be from thinking him too much in your intere&s;t. The &s;ame per&s;on told him (who &s;ometimes conver&s;es with Cre&s;|&s;et) that Mr. Pitt was better at that court than u&s;ual: to what degree, or by what means he did not know; but that he found Cre&s;&s;et &s;poke more favourably of him, than he u&s;ed to do. Fox continued then to &s;ay, that Lord Egmont, was thought to have the chief management there; and that the Prince was much fonder of that Lord, than of any other man living. I &s;aid, that Mr. Pitt might have &s;ent offers of &s;ervice, per|haps by Lady Charlotte Edwin, whom my women relations, the Grenvilles and Tem|ples, have been courting all the winter,
<PB N="343" REF="355">
and that they might have been very civilly received and returned: but, that there had been any communication, or propo&s;ition of mea&s;ures between them, or even an au|dience, I did not believe. I might proba|bly think there were no &s;ettled mea&s;ures, but if there were, I thought that neither Pitt nor Egmont had the &s;ecret or the ma|nagement of them, but Cre&s;&s;et only. What then could this tran&s;action, either real or imaginary, amount to but refinement? Could it influence Mr. Pitt's acting in publick? or his (Fox's) in con&s;equence? Then we entered into the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs; and he told me, that the courier, that came the 28th, pa&s;t, with the an&s;wer from Hanover, which was expected to be a deci&s;ive one as to the &s;ailing of the fleet, brought back a letter, which was neither written by Lord Holderne&s;s, nor dictated by the King, but which was certainly &s;ent from hence by the Duke of Newca&s;tle (to gain &s;o much time for inaction) as a proper return for the King to make. For it ac|quainted them, that the King cannot give any po&s;itive orders about the operations of
<PB N="344" REF="356">
the fleet, till he was fully informed of three particular things, which he (Fox) &s;aid he had forgotten, but they were trifles: that tho&s;e trifles were an&s;wered, and his Ma|je&s;ty was humbly advi&s;ed to leave the di|rection of the fleet to their di&s;cretion; and that, by the return of the courier, he had done &s;o: that now, till they had dige&s;ted &s;omething po&s;itive, they agreed to &s;end an order to Sir Edward Hawke, that he &s;hould &s;ail with about &s;ixteen &s;hips of the line to Torbay, and there expect farther in&s;truc|tions: that the&s;e farther in&s;tructions were to be drawn up by Lord An&s;on and Sir Thomas Robin&s;on: that the Duke of Cum|berland had &s;aid, if they had any pro&s;pect of a peace, he had nothing to &s;ay; but if they were convinced it mu&s;t be war, he had no notion of not making the mo&s;t of the &s;trength and opportunity we had in our hands: that, afterwards, in a window with the Dukes of Marlborough and New|ca&s;tle, the latter &s;aid, that, what his Royal Highne&s;s had declared, was full of very good &s;en&s;e, though he was not entirely of the &s;ame opinion: that Lord Granville was
<PB N="345" REF="357">
ab&s;olutely again&s;t meddling with trade&mdash; he called it, vexing your neighbours for a little muck&mdash;but that the Duke of New|ca&s;tle was by no means of that opinion, but thought &s;ome middle way might be &s;ound out. He was a&s;ked, what way? He an|&s;wered, that, to be &s;ure, Hawke mu&s;t go out; but that he might be ordered not to attack the enemy, unle&s;s he thought it worth while. He was an&s;wered, that Hawke was too wi&s;e to do any thing at all, which others, when done, were to pronounce he ought to be hanged for. The Duke re|plied, what if he had orders not to fall upon them, unle&s;s they were more in number together than ten? He was an&s;wered, that the returned part of the Bre&s;t &s;quadron, now at Li&s;bon, is but nine. The Duke &s;aid, he meant <HI>that</HI> of merchantmen only, for, to be &s;ure, he mu&s;t attack any &s;quadron of &s;hips of war. He was a&s;ked, what was a &s;quadron? He &s;aid, three &s;hips or more. This ab&s;urdity is inconceivable. What or|ders they will give to Hawke to-morrow, I &s;hall not go out of my way to enquire.</P>

But the departure of Mon&s;. de Mirepoix looks as if the French would take it up with a high hand, and this may render Hawke's in&s;tructions &s;ome|thing more explicit. Mr. Fox a&s;&s;ured me of one thing ye&s;terday, which &s;urpri&s;ed me much: he &s;aid, that the Ru&s;&s;ians, hitherto, had refu&s;ed our &s;ub&s;idy; as al&s;o, that the Queen of Hungary had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, not only our money, but to have any thing to do with us, &s;aying, it is our own quar|rel and &s;he will not be concerned in it. She is &s;ure, that the French will not med|dle with her, and therefore &s;he will &s;end no troops into Flanders, even if we would be at the whole expence. He added, that, upon his telling his Royal Highne&s;s, that the Duke of Newca&s;tle was for a naval war,
<PB N="347" REF="359">
his Royal Highne&s;s laughed at him, and &s;aid, it was, becau&s;e he could get nobody to take his money, and that he ordered, of his own authority, that more money &s;hould be offered to the Ru&s;&s;ians, than the Re|gency knew of, or even the King; (as he &s;uppo&s;ed.) I pre&s;&s;ed Fox much (who did not &s;eem to feel the force of it) to try if he could fix &s;uch a fact on the Duke of New|ca&s;tle, which is not only criminal in it&s;elf, but if it was approved of afterwards, would be &s;ufficient to frighten him out of his wits, for having acted extra-provincially.

thought it impo&s;&s;ible, and though he had hitherto been very lucky, yet the whole would certainly break about his ears. The Duke &s;aid, he &s;till approved of what he (Hallifax) had advi&s;ed, and he was of the &s;ame intention to do it, but that he could &s;ettle nothing till the King returned. Lord Hallifax replied, that was his Grace's af|fair, and he did not care if his Grace made Mr. Pitt, Secretary; but if he made any alterations, that he (Hallifax) expected to have ju&s;tice done him; he was a wretch, a nobody; he would be of the Cabinet, and have acce&s;s to the King, if any thing was done. The Duke &s;aid, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him talk in this manner, and went on, as if it was laying him under new diffi|culties. To which Lord Hallifax replied, that he found it was more nece&s;&s;ary to talk &s;o, than he at fir&s;t thought, for by his Grace's &s;urpri&s;e, it was plain, that he never thought of it at all: that, though a lover of an active life, yet in the way he was treated, he was weary of it, and would quit it, if ju&s;tice was not done him: that he found, Bo&s;cawen was coming home,
<PB N="350" REF="362">
and he believed the Duke of Newca&s;tle un+der&s;tood that part of the &s;quadron was t$ return with him, and a force equal to wha$ was in Loui&s;bourg, to be left for a time&punc; that he (Hallifax) oppo&s;ed this &s;trongly and &s;aid, if the force to be left is but equal, &s;uppo&s;e the French &s;hould come out and beat them, is it impo&s;&s;ible? Suppo&s;e the &s;quadron, under La Mothe, at Quebec, &s;hould know that there was but an equal number left, might they not fall upon them, and be joined by tho&s;e in Loui&s;bourg, was that impo&s;&s;ible? That the enemy was certainly &s;traitned in provi&s;ions, and if a &s;uperior force remained there, the place, in all probability, mu&s;t fall to us. The Duke &s;aid, the &s;hips could not winter there, and Lord An&s;on was of that opinion. Lord Hallifax replied, he did not regard Lord An&s;on's opinion again&s;t fact; for he would maintain, that the whole navy might ride, the whole winter in Hallifax harbour, with the utmo&s;t &s;afety: that the Albany &s;loop had been there, the&s;e five years, and had co&s;t as little in repairs, as any other ve&s;&s;el, and is now gone out again. The rea&s;oning
<PB N="351" REF="363">
&s;eemed to be thus&mdash;If you leave tho&s;e &s;eas, the French will come out, and Loui&s;bourg will be victualled. If you leave but a &s;mall force, it will be in danger from the &s;hips there, and from a junction of tho&s;e now in the Gulph of St. Lawrence. The French cannot remain there in November, without being frozen up. You can &s;tay, becau&s;e the harbour of Hallifax is never frozen, or very &s;lightly; and you are at &s;ea from thence in &s;even hours, and therefore never need have the &s;ame &s;hips out above a week at a time: &s;o, if the enemy appears, you take them&mdash; if not, you freeze them up, and their num|bers will add to the want of provi&s;ions in the place. The Duke of Newca&s;tle pre&s;&s;ed him to give him the&s;e hints in writing, which Lord Hallifax declined.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the day at Kew. The Prince&s;s<MILESTONE N="6."

She inveighed mo&s;t bitterly again&s;t the not pu&s;hing the French every where. The people would not &s;urely bear it, when the

Parliament met. I &s;aid, I believed they would. Surely, &s;aid &s;he, the Parliament would never bear the &s;uffering the French to bring home their trade and &s;ailors, &amp;c. She &s;aw the terrible con&s;equences of it, and of a patched up peace, which mu&s;t break out, when the French had perfected their naval plan, and fall upon her &s;on, young and inexperienced, at the beginning of his reign. I &s;aid, I doubted if any body would interfere; but if they &s;hould, I hope, Madam, you would not take it ill. I, &s;ays &s;he, no, indeed, very far from it; I am &s;ure, I have no rea&s;on nor any thing like it. She was very &s;olicitous to pu&s;h the war, and wi&s;hed Hanover in the &s;ea, as the cau&s;e of all our misfortunes. I &s;aid, I pre&s;umed to differ with her, that I was as ready to defend Hanover, as Hamp&s;hire, if attacked on our account. I thought it no incum|brance if properly treated, and the only difference between me and the Mini&s;ters, was not about the thing, but the manner. She &s;aid, &s;he perfectly under&s;tood me; and it would be &s;o in another reign, but could not be in this; that, in the manner it had
<PB N="353" REF="365">
been treated, it had been the foundation of all ju&s;t complaints and bad mea&s;ures. I a&s;ked her, if &s;he could account for Lord An&s;on and the Duke of Cumberland con|curring in tying up Hawke's hands: the one, as a &s;ea General, unconnected at lea&s;t; the other, as a land General, at open en|mity with the Duke of Newca&s;tle? &s;he &s;aid, &s;he could not, for the Duke had &s;trongly declared (though not to her, who had not much conver&s;ation with him) for a <HI>naval</HI> war. I replied, that might be the language of good &s;en&s;e only, as being the popular cry, with hopes, that a &s;ea war might probably light up a land one. She &s;aid, I was right&mdash;and added, nobody knew what to do&mdash;no two people were together&mdash;&s;he cho&s;e to &s;it &s;till, (thinking it the only prudent part, as every body was di&s;united. I &s;aid, that the general diffidence &s;he de&s;cribed was the cau&s;e of the infinite &s;peculation and refinement that now prevailed: for as nobody knew, &s;o every one was gue&s;&s;ing each other&mdash;in which her Royal Highne&s;s had a principal part&mdash;&s;he replied, nobody, &s;urely, could
<PB N="354" REF="366">
&s;tand clearer than &s;he, for the world mu&s;t know every body that &s;he &s;aw, and when. She took &s;erious pains to convince me, that &s;he had no fixed &s;ettlement or con|nections at all. She may deceive me; but I am per&s;uaded, &s;he has no fixed, dige&s;ted political plan, or regular communication in politicks, with any body, except Mr. Cre&s;&s;et. She then told me, that the King had &s;ent to invite the two Prince&s;&s;es of Brun&s;wick to Hanover; they came, but their mother (the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's &s;i&s;ter) who was not invited, came with them&mdash; we talked of the match&mdash;&s;urely he would not marry her &s;on, without acquainting her with it &s;o much as by letter&mdash;I &s;aid, certainly not, as he had always behaved very politely to her. It may be &s;o, &s;he replied, but how can this be reconciled? In this manner, &s;aid I; nothing will be &s;ettled at Hanover; but when the King comes back, he may &s;ay in conver&s;ation and commending the Prince's figure, that he wi&s;hes to &s;ee him &s;ettled, before he dies, and that he has &s;een &s;uch and &s;uch young Prince&s;&s;es, and, though he would
<PB N="355" REF="367">
&s;ettle nothing, without her participation, yet he could wi&s;h to &s;ee the Prince &s;ettled before his death, and therefore, if &s;he had no objection, he &s;hould think one of tho&s;e Prince&s;&s;es a very &s;uitable party.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, and &s;aid, no: he was not that &s;ort of man: but, if he &s;hould &s;ettle the match without acquainting her with it, &s;he &s;hould let him know how ill &s;he took it; and if he did it in the manner I mentioned, &s;he &s;hould not fail to tell him fairly and plainly, that it was full early, and that &s;he had eight other children to be provided for, that &s;he hoped, he would think of doing for them, and not leave her elde&s;t &s;on eight younger children to take care of, before he had one of his own: that it was probable the Prince might have &s;o many, that hers could not expect much provi&s;ion. She was determined to behave &s;o, whenever the King &s;poke to her about it. She thought the match premature: the Prince ought to mix with the world &mdash;the marriage would prevent it&mdash;he was &s;hy and backward, the match would &s;hut

him up for ever, with two or three friends of his, and as many of hers. That he was much aver&s;e to it him&s;elf, and that &s;he di&s;|liked the alliance extremely: that the young woman was &s;aid to be hand&s;ome, and had all good qualities and abundance of wit, &amp;c. but if &s;he took after her mo|ther, &s;he will never do here&mdash;the Duke of Brun&s;wick indeed, her father, is a very worthy man&mdash;pray madam, &s;aid I, what is her mother? as I know nothing at all about her&mdash;why, &s;aid &s;he, her mother is the mo&s;t intriguing, medling, and al&s;o the mo&s;t &s;atirical, &s;arca&s;tical per&s;on in the world, and will always make mi&s;chief wherever &s;he comes. Such a character would not do with George, it would not only hurt him in his publick, but make him unea&s;y in his private &s;ituation; that he was not a wild, di&s;&s;ipated boy, but good natured and chearful, with a &s;erious ca&s;t upon the whole&mdash;that tho&s;e, about him, knew him no more, than if they had never &s;een him. That he was not quick, but, with tho&s;e he was acquainted, appli|cable and intelligent. His education had
<PB N="357" REF="369">
given her much pain; his book learning &s;he was no judge of, though &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it &s;mall or u&s;ele&s;s; but &s;he hoped he might have been in&s;tructed in the general under&s;tanding of things. That &s;he did not know Lord Waldgrave, and as to Mr. Stone, if &s;he was to live forty years in the hou&s;e with him, &s;he &s;hould never be bet|ter acquainted with him than &s;he was. She once de&s;ired him to inform the Prince about the con&s;titution; but he declined it, to avoid giving jealou&s;y to the Bi&s;hop of Norwich; and that &s;he had mentioned it again, but he &s;till declined it, as not being his province. Pray, madam, &s;aid I, what is his province? &s;he &s;aid, &s;he did not know, unle&s;s it was, to go before the Prince up|&s;tairs, to walk with him &s;ometimes, &s;el|domer to ride with him, and, now and then, to dine with him&mdash;but when they did walk together the Prince generally took that time, to think of his own affairs and to &s;ay nothing. She &s;hewed me a letter from Hanover, that &s;aid, the news of Bo&s;|cawen's action, which came here on the 15th of June, got to Hanover on the 20th

<P><MILESTONE N="18." UNIT="Augu&s;t">I was at Holland Hou&s;e, and had a long conver&s;ation with Mr. Fox: he &s;aid, the He&s;&s;ian &s;ub&s;idy was ratified&mdash;that the Duke of Newca&s;tle bade Mr. Amyand read Lord Holderne&s;s's letter to the Regency, acquainting them, that the King had made &s;uch a treaty, and cau&s;ed him to ob&s;erve, that his Maje&s;ty directed the Chancellor to fix the &s;eal to it, who only bowed, and their Lord&s;hips &s;igned it without reading it, as a thing of cour&s;e. That the fir&s;t directions to Lord An&s;on and Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, to draw Hawke's in&s;tructions, were, that he &s;hould take and de&s;troy all French &s;hips of war, but no merchant|men

&mdash;when they were brought to the &s;elect per&s;ons of the Regency, they had altered them and re&s;trained Hawke from taking any but &s;hips of the line. The Duke of Cumberland, in this little a&s;&s;embly, was expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;like of the alteration, when the Duke of Newca&s;tle came in, and interrupted his Highne&s;s by &s;aying, that he was glad of the alteration, becau&s;e he knew that it was more conformable to the King's way of thinking, and then de&s;ired his Highne&s;s to proceed; who &s;aid, that he knew his Grace had corre&s;pondences at Hanover, which he did not communicate to him; but he did not know, that his Grace had taken his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, upon that head, till now, when he was plea&s;ed to declare it&mdash;that, &s;ince it was &s;o, he had too many ties ever to &s;ay a word again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, when he knew it. When the in&s;tructions came to the bottom of the table to be &s;igned by him (Fox): he a&s;ked Lord An&s;on, if there were no objections to them, who &s;aid, yes, a hundred, but it plea&s;es tho&s;e at the upper end of the table, and will &s;ignify nothing,

for the French will declare war next week, if they have not done it already. But &s;aid I, that did not happen&mdash;no, replied he, and therefore I am very &s;orry that I &s;igned it. But in a few days, the Duke was very de&s;irous to have them altered, as well as the Duke of Marlborough and my&s;elf; and in the morning before the Regency met, he endeavoured to have them extended, but without effect&mdash;when the Regency was over, the Duke of Marlborough and I de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Duke of New|ca&s;tle, and I told him, how ab&s;urd I thought it, that we, who had begun the war, &s;hould &s;uffer the hands, to pa&s;s by us, that were to be employed again&s;t us, &amp;c. that I de&s;ired him to remember, though I had made no objection at the Regency, yet I now did, and privately to him, declare my di&s;approbation to the&s;e orders. The Duke of Marlborough did the &s;ame. In the afternoon, a note came to Lord An&s;on, while he was at dinner at Mr. Fox's, to meet that evening at the Duke's lodgings, the re&s;ult of which was to &s;end directions to Hawke to &s;eize or de&s;troy every thing

French, trade or men of war, between Cape Artegal and Cape Clear, and &s;o it now &s;tands. Mr. Fox added that, be&s;ides the He&s;&s;ian, a &s;ub&s;idiary treaty was con|cluded with Ru&s;&s;ia, as he under&s;tood, though he had not heard, directly, from Williams. He did not &s;peak out about that corre&s;pondence. The &s;ub&s;idy was 100,000<HI>l. per annum</HI> for four years, to hold in readine&s;s 50 or 60,000 men, for which, when we employed them, we were to pay 500,000<HI>l. per annum</HI>. He al&s;o &s;up|po&s;ed, that there would be &s;ub&s;idies to Ba|varia, and others. Mr. Fox continued, that he had, of late, had opportunities of conver&s;ing much with the Duke of De|von&s;hire, occa&s;ioned by his &s;on's affairs: that he was open and vehement again&s;t all &s;ub&s;idies what&s;oever; that the nation could not carry on a naval war with France, and &s;upport Hanover, and that it mu&s;t take care of it&s;elf: that we had followed the King's politicks too long, and the King mu&s;t be told that the nation could not &s;upport the expence of both: that the Duke of Newca&s;tle held by nothing but

ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and he mu&s;t not, nor would he contradict the King in any thing. Fox &s;aid, that Lord Granville told the Duke of Newca&s;tle, that he would be &s;erved him&s;elf, as he and his brother had &s;erved him (Granville). They would not aba&s;e him, them&s;elves, but would fit &s;till and ra|ther encourage the abu&s;e, than defend him. He po&s;itively knew &s;ome con&s;iderable peo|ple, not &s;u&s;pected of an inclination to dif|fer, who would be ab&s;olutely again&s;t all &s;ub&s;idy what&s;oever&mdash;he did not name them, nor would he to him (Fox). Mr. Fox &s;aid, that, talking this matter of &s;ub&s;idies over with the Duke, his Highne&s;s &s;aid in a word, that he was very &s;orry for them, that the bent of the nation was &s;trong again&s;t &s;ub&s;idies for Germany, and that it would be brought to endure them with much reluctance: that his Highne&s;s laid no great weight upon the point of honour, for it would not do with the bulk of the peo|ple: that we &s;hould &s;ee a &s;trong exertion of power on one hand, and a &s;trong di&s;like and re&s;tivene&s;s on the other. I &s;aid, I thought Hanover might, and ought to be

defended; the que&s;tion was only, who was to pay for it, and in what proportions? Mr. Fox replied, he was &s;urpri&s;ed that I was not again&s;t all &s;ub&s;idies. I told him that tho&s;e, I &s;hould be for, would hardly be the mini&s;terial ones, but I de&s;ired to know what tho&s;e Ru&s;&s;ians were to do? Why, &s;aid he, to prevent the King of Pru&s;&s;ia from attacking Hanover in conjunction with the French. I an&s;wered, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia would not attack Hanover. He &s;aid, he was glad to hear me &s;ay &s;o, and hoped I could make it out. I &s;aid, there was time enough for that, and for my ideas of de|fending Hanover. He might imagine, that I had not given my&s;elf the trouble to dige&s;t my thoughts with very great exactne&s;s, much le&s;s, to put them into writing; but that, whenever he came to act, I would lay every thing I knew before him without re&s;erve, but it was now u&s;ele&s;s to dige&s;t and di&s;cu&s;s what might never come into operation.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt called on me, and acquainted<MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Sept."> me that he had &s;een the Mini&s;ters, and that

he was to &s;ee the Duke of Newca&s;tle at his own de&s;ire, at &s;even this evening. He be|gan upon the &s;ub&s;idies: that the He&s;&s;ian he knew of for 8000 men, as a warrant for the levee money was come to his office: that he would &s;upport a naval war to the utmo&s;t, but, by no means, a continental one: the nation could not &s;upport both: it would carry us up to &s;even millions the fir&s;t year, and would go on encrea&s;ing;&mdash; 'twas bankruptcy. Regard &s;hould be had to Hanover, no doubt, but &s;econdarily: we &s;hould never lay down our arms without procuring &s;atisfaction for any damage they &s;hould receive on our account; but we could not find money to defend it by &s;ub|&s;idies, and if we could, that was not the way to defend it. An open country was not to be defended again&s;t a neighbour who had 150,000 men, and an enemy that had 150,000 more to back them. In &s;hort, he urged many &s;trong, ingenious, and &s;olid rea&s;ons, for making a &s;tand again&s;t them and giving no &s;ub&s;idies at all: that the King's honour would be pre&s;&s;ed, &amp;c. and therefore, if the Duke of Newca&s;tle would

be contented with this He&s;&s;ian &s;ub&s;idy for this once only, and engage, <HI>with proper &s;e|curity</HI>, never to offer another during the whole cour&s;e of the war, and receive it as a compliment to the King for this once, ne|ver to be renewed or attempted again, but to be looked upon as putting a final end to continental &s;ub&s;idies; then&mdash;though it would not be right, yet he might not ab|&s;olutely reject it, but might a&s;k other gen|tlemen's opinion about it: but for the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ub&s;idy of 120,000<HI>l. per annum</HI>, and 500,000<HI>l. per annum</HI> when we took the number of men into pay, which treaty he heard was &s;igned, if not ratified, he could never come into it upon any account&mdash; 'twas better to &s;peak plain, there was no end of the&s;e things: it was deceiving and ruining our&s;elves, and leading Hanover into a &s;nare; for if 70,000 men would not be &s;ufficient, we mu&s;t take more, till they were &s;ufficient, which would ruin us, or we mu&s;t give them up at la&s;t, when we had drawn a war upon them: that the Duke of Newca&s;tle had made a per&s;on write to him (Pitt) to &s;ay, that the Duke was &s;orry

that he was obliged to go into Su&s;&s;ex the next day, but that the Chancellor did not go to Wimple till Wedne&s;day, and he &s;hould be obliged to Mr. Pitt, if he would call upon the Chancellor, which he did. The Chancellor told him, that he hoped, he would a&s;&s;i&s;t them cordially in their bu&s;i|ne&s;s; that the King had, indeed, taken pre|judices which were di&s;agreeable, and that &s;teps had been taken to remove them, be|fore he went to Hanover: that they had been the &s;ubject of corre&s;pondence &s;ince: that they had not all the &s;ucce&s;s they could wi&s;h, <HI>as yet</HI>, but they hoped they would: that the King was very fond of Lord Hol|derne&s;s and Sir Thomas Robin&s;on; but if any accident &s;hould happen, it might pro|bably be brought about, in ca&s;e he would a&s;&s;i&s;t them cordially, that they might pro|cure the &s;eals for him, which he &s;o much de&s;ired. When the Chancellor had fini&s;hed, Mr. Pitt replied, that he mu&s;t begin with his la&s;t words&mdash;the &s;eals which he &s;o much de&s;ired&mdash;of whom?&mdash;he did not remember that he had ever applied to his Lord&s;hip for them: he was &s;ure, he never had to the

Duke of Newca&s;tle; and did a&s;&s;ure the Chancellor, that if they could prevail upon his Maje&s;ty to give them to him, under his pre&s;ent di&s;like, all the u&s;e he would make of them, would be to lay them at his Ma|je&s;ty's feet: that, till the King liked it, and thought it nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;ervice, and till his Mini&s;ters de&s;ired it, he never would accept the &s;eals: that he knew, the King had lately &s;aid, that he had intruded him|&s;elf into office: that the Chancellor knew how much he was mi&s;informed, and if he &s;hould a&s;k for any favour, it would be, that they &s;hould inform his Maje&s;ty better: the Chancellor had &s;aid a great deal, but he de&s;ired his Lord&s;hip to let him know, what he was expected to a&s;&s;i&s;t in, and what was the work? Why, replied the Chancellor, to carry on the war they were engaged in. He &s;aid, there was no doubt of his concur|rence in carrying on the war, as it was a national war; and he thought that regard ought to be had to Hanover, if it &s;hould be attacked upon our account&mdash;The Chan|cellor &s;topt him &s;hort, and &s;aid, he was ex|tremely plea&s;ed that they agreed in their
<PB N="368" REF="380">
principles, and that both thought Hanover <HI>&s;hould be defended</HI>. Mr. Pitt de&s;ired his Lord&s;hip to ob&s;erve the words he had u&s;ed, "that regard was to be had to Hanover," and then &s;aid all he had &s;aid to me before, as to our inability to defend it, and the im|propriety of the defence by &s;ub&s;idy. The Chancellor &s;aid, that he under&s;tood that the Commons, the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, had tacitly allowed, that Hanover mu&s;t be defended: that, in con&s;equence of that acquie&s;cence, there was a &s;ub&s;idiary treaty for 8000 He&s;|&s;ians in the u&s;ual form, and al&s;o, a treaty for a body of Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>But where Mr. Pitt laid the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s, was on what the Chancellor in rea&s;oning had &s;aid; to be &s;ure <HI>tho&s;e things</HI> (meaning &s;ub&s;idies) <HI>&s;hould have their bounds, and that</HI>, he was afraid, <HI>they would not be very popular</HI>; and when he was enforcing the nece&s;&s;ity of putting a total &s;top to them, and leaving Hanover to the &s;y&s;tem and con&s;titution of the empire, the Chancellor &s;eemed to ac|quie&s;ce in the rea&s;on, but told him, he mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that talking in that man|ner

would not make way with the King. Mr. Pitt &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in not giving into the &s;ub&s;idy, and the Chancellor de&s;ired him to &s;ee the Duke of Newca&s;tle, and to talk it over with him. Mr. Pitt &s;aid that, if the Duke &s;ent to de&s;ire to &s;peak with him, he would wait on his Grace, and not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt thought that the Duke of De|von&s;hire would oppo&s;e &s;ub&s;idies, and might be brought to do it in the Hou&s;e of Lords. He had &s;een the Duke of Bedford, who talked warmly and &s;en&s;ibly about them. He left me, fully determined to tell the Duke of Newca&s;tle plainly, that he would not come into the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ub&s;idy upon any account; nor into any thing el&s;e, till he was well appri&s;ed of the mea&s;ures; till he knew who were to carry them into exe|cution, and in what &s;tations they were to be; and till the Hou&s;e was properly treated, and gentlemen were made ea&s;y, who had a right to be &s;o. He had not &s;een Lord Eg|mont, but knew he had been &s;ent to with an offer of Sir William Young's place. He
<PB N="370" REF="382">
hoped, his Lord&s;hip had given no po&s;itive an&s;wer. He promi&s;ed to acquaint me, with the re&s;ult of the conference he was to have this evening, with the Duke of New|ca&s;tle, before he went back into the coun|try, which he &s;hould do to-morrow.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3." UNIT="Sept.">Mr. Pitt returned to me, and told me, that he had painted to the Duke all the ill con&s;equences of this &s;y&s;tem of &s;ub&s;idies in the &s;tronge&s;t light, that his own imagina|tion, heightened by my &s;ugge&s;tions, could furni&s;h him with. He had deprecated his Grace, not to compleat the ruin which the King had nearly brought upon him&s;elf by his journey to Hanover, which all peo|ple &s;hould have prevented, even <HI>with their bodies</HI>.&mdash;A King abroad, at this time, with|out one man about him, that has one En|gli&s;h &s;entiment, and to bring home a whole &s;et of &s;ub&s;idies!&mdash;That he was willing to promote the King's &s;ervice, but if this was what he was &s;ent for to promote, few words were be&s;t&mdash;nothing in the world &s;hould induce him to agree to the&s;e &s;ub&s;i|dies. The Duke was tedious and perplexed,
<PB N="371" REF="383">
and would have per&s;uaded him what a pretty figure he would make, when he was a Ca|binet Coun&s;ellor: that the King was highly plea&s;ed with both his Secretaries, but if any accident &s;hould make a vacancy, to be &s;ure, the King would be glad of his &s;ervices, &amp;c. Mr. Pitt &s;aid, that he did not de&s;ire &s;uch vacancy, nor the office; that he had declared, when pre&s;&s;ed about the Hou&s;e of Commons, that, if they expected him, or any one el&s;e, to do their bu&s;ine&s;s in that hou&s;e, they mu&s;t give him proper di&s;tinc|tion and powers: that, in &s;hort, the Duke's &s;y&s;tem of carrying on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e, he believed, would not do, and that, while he had life and breath to utter, he would oppo&s;e it: that there mu&s;t be men of efficiency and authority, in the Hou&s;e; a Secretary and a Chancellor of the Ex|chequer at lea&s;t, who &s;hould have acce&s;s to the Crown; habitual, frequent, familiar acce&s;s he meant, that they might tell their own &s;tory, to do them&s;elves and their friends ju&s;tice, and not be the victims of a whi&s;per: that he (Pitt) e&s;teemed both the Secreta|ries, but he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;omething was want|ing,
<PB N="372" REF="384">
or why was he &s;ent for? If they were nece&s;&s;ary to government, no doubt they could carry on government, and he &s;hould be glad of it; for his part, if the Mini&s;try a&s;ked nothing of him, he a&s;ked nothing of them. The Duke then &s;aid, that the <HI>&s;y&s;tem</HI> of &s;ub&s;idies, indeed, was not to be in&s;i&s;ted upon, but two did not make a &s;y&s;tem: the King's honour was now engaged, and he enlarged much upon that point. Mr. Pitt replied, that he had a deep regard for the King's honour, but that the &s;y&s;tem of &s;ub|&s;idies was &s;o fatal, that he could not think of &s;ubmitting to 100,000<HI>l.</HI> unle&s;s it was given by gentlemen who became pledges to each other, and to the public; that no|thing, of the like kind, &s;hould ever be offered again, and unle&s;s it &s;hould be noto|riou&s;ly declared and under&s;tood on both &s;ides, that it was given and received, as a mark of the affection of a ruined nation, to &s;ave the honour of its King, who had entered into a ra&s;h engagement: but for two, it was the &s;ame as twenty, and no per&s;ua&s;ion &s;hould make him for them. He then de&s;ired his Grace to think &s;eriou&s;ly of
<PB N="373" REF="385">
the con&s;equences&mdash;What, if the Duke of Devon&s;hire &s;hould begin the oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Lords? If he did, he (Pitt) would not conceal it from the Duke of Newca&s;tle; he would echo it in the Hou&s;e of Commons, as loudly, and with all the powers he was able to exert:&mdash;But was this all?&mdash;were there no &s;ub&s;idies to be re|newed? The Duke mumbled that the Saxon an$ Bavarian were offered and pre&s;&s;ed, but there was nothing done in them: that the He&s;&s;ian was perfected, but the Ru&s;&s;ian was not concluded. Whether the Duke meant un&s;igned, or unratified, we cannot tell, but we under&s;tand it is &s;igned. When his Grace dwelt &s;o much upon the King's honour, Mr. Pitt a&s;ked him&mdash;what, if out of the fifteen millions the King had &s;aved, he &s;hould give his kin&s;man of He&s;&s;e; 100,000<HI>l.</HI> and the Cza|$ 150,000<HI>l.</HI> to be off from the&s;e bad bar|g$ins, and not &s;uffer the &s;ugge&s;tions, &s;o dan|gerous to his own quiet and the &s;afety of his family, to be thrown out, which would, and mu&s;t be, in&s;i&s;ted upon in a debate of this na|ture? Where would be the harm of it? The Duke had nothing to &s;ay, but de&s;ired they
<PB N="374" REF="386">
might talk it over again with the Chancellor: Mr. Pitt replied, he was at their command, though nothing could alter his opinion.</P>
<P>We then, Mr. Pitt and I, talked over whom we could engage; to whom he had communicated this affair? He &s;aid, that Mr. Legge was firm as a rock. He was &s;hy about Lord Egmont, but &s;aid he had &s;een him; he was received very kindly, and Lord Egmont &s;eemed to enter into the thing; but what might happen, when of|fers were made, he (Pitt) could not tell. He de&s;ired me to apply to Lord Hill&s;bo|rough and Sir Francis Da&s;hwood&mdash;I men|tioned O&s;wald&mdash;he &s;aid, he thought that O&s;wald was with us (if &s;o, it mu&s;t be by Legge). I a&s;ked him, if he had commu|nicated it to Mr. Fox? He an&s;wered, no, nor did he de&s;ign to do it: he would tell me the whole of his thoughts upon that matter: that he wi&s;hed Mr. Fox very well, and had nothing to complain of; but that they could not act together, becau&s;e they were not on the &s;ame ground: that Mr. Fox owned to him that he (Fox) was not
<PB N="375" REF="387">
<HI>&s;ui juris</HI>; he could not blame him for it, but he, who was <HI>&s;ui juris</HI>, could not act in connection with one who was not. He (Pitt) was ready, in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, to pro|ceed any lengths again&s;t the Duke of New|ca&s;tle, but when it came to the pu&s;h, Mr. Fox acknowledged he could not, and went on, through the whole &s;e&s;&s;ion, compromi|&s;ing every thing when it began to pinch&mdash; the Reading election; the linen affair; and when Ireland began to be a thorn, Mr. Fox's great friend. Lord Harrington, was to take it out: that by the&s;e means, Mr. Fox had taken the &s;mooth part, and had left him to be fallen upon: Fox had ri&s;en upon his &s;houlders, but he did not blame him, and he only &s;hewed me, how impo&s;|&s;ible it was for two to act together, who did not &s;tand upon the &s;ame ground. Be|&s;ides this, Mr. Fox lived with his greate&s;t enemies. Lord Granville, Me&s;&s;rs. Stone and Murray. Mr. Fox was reported by the Duke of Newca&s;tle, that he had lately of|fered him&s;elf to the Duke&mdash;I here inter|rupted Mr. Pitt, by &s;aying, I was confident it was fal&s;e: he &s;aid, he knew the Duke of
<PB N="376" REF="388">
Newca&s;tle was a very great liar, and there|fore, if Mr. Fox denied it, he &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment, which he &s;hould be|lieve. I then &s;aid, that, as tho&s;e, who united in this attack, were to part no more, it would be proper to think what was to be held out to them, if they &s;ucceeded: he declined this, and &s;aid, it would look too much like a faction; there was nothing country in it. If we &s;ucceeded, to be &s;ure tho&s;e, who contributed, mu&s;t, and would be con&s;idered, when the fir&s;t opportunity of|fered; but to engage for &s;pecifical things and times, he thought no one man had any title, except my&s;elf: that for me, any thing, every thing that I liked, ought to be the common cau&s;e, and he was ready to enter into any engagements with me. He then expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf <HI>&s;trangely</HI> as to me: that he thought me of the greate&s;t con&s;equence; no man in this country would be more li&s;tened to, both in and out of the Hou&s;e, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;that he was mo&s;t de&s;irous to con|nect and unite him&s;elf with me in the &s;tricte&s;t manner&mdash;he ever had the highe&s;t regard for my abilities&mdash;we had always
<PB N="377" REF="389">
acted upon the &s;ame principles: he had the honour of being married into my relations; every thing invited him to it. He added a great deal more, that &s;urpri&s;ed me very much, con&s;idering the treatment I have met with, for years pa&s;t, both from him and tho&s;e relations. It &s;urpri&s;ed me &s;o much, that all I &s;aid was, that I was much obliged to him, but that he might depend upon it, that I would not accept of his friend&s;hip, or of any mark of his confidence, without meet|ing him more than half way.</P>
<P>Thus far, however, is fortunate, and I am glad to find, that I &s;hall be &s;upported in a &s;tep, which, for my own credit, as well as for the intere&s;t of my country, I mu&s;t have taken, though I had met with no &s;upport at all.</P>
<P>Lord Hallifax dined with me, and we<MILESTONE N="6." UNIT="Oct."> &s;ettled how he was to behave to the Duke of Newca&s;tle, on account of a letter to him from his Grace, pre&s;&s;ing him to engage me in the King's &s;ervice.</P>

That they had taken Mahon, and pretended to take St. Philip's, by the end of the month.

He &s;aid, he was not ready, and he was obliged to &s;tay two or three days for his la&s;t 200 men. That we had but 63 &s;hips of the line in Europe, and even tho&s;e &s;till wanted 4000 men. That it was <HI>impar congre&s;&s;us</HI>, and that Mirepoix had told him, that 30 of his ma&s;ter's &s;hips would amu&s;e 80 of ours. That, if Hawke and Bo&s;cawen did not join, we had no naval force equal to what the enemy had at Bre&s;t. I a&s;ked, why were
<PB N="381" REF="393">
you not ready? why have you not more &s;hips, and more men? he replied, he had not the direction of the &s;ea, and his Grace laid a great deal of blame there. And without naming Lord An&s;on, he &s;hewed him&s;elf extremely di&s;atisfied with him; but conjured me, upon my honour, not to mention to any body, what he had &s;aid upon that head. He concluded by in&s;i&s;t|ing that the i&s;land mu&s;t be retaken.</P>
<P>I called upon Mr. Fox. He was full<MILESTONE N="7." UNIT="May"> of concern. He would have &s;ent a &s;qua|dron, and a &s;trong one, the fir&s;t week in March, but could not prevail. Lord An&s;on a&s;&s;ured him, and took it upon him&s;elf, that Byng's &s;quadron would beat any thing the French had, or could have in the Medi|terranean.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox came to me in the Hou&s;e, and<MILESTONE N="17." UNIT="May"> after &s;aying that he mu&s;t &s;hortly call on me, to talk a little freely, as he was very unea&s;y at the po&s;ture of publick affairs, and, particularly, with his own &s;ituation. That the Duke of Newca&s;tle was unu&s;ually
<PB N="382" REF="394">
light and trifling, ye&s;terday, when his Grace dined with him: that he was ex|tremely plea&s;ed with what he (Fox) had declared, on Friday la&s;t, in the Hou&s;e, which was, that Lord An&s;on authorized him to &s;ay, that the Duke had never ob|&s;tructed the &s;ending &s;ooner to the Mediter|ranean, (which was more, &s;ays he, than he could ever make Lord An&s;on &s;ay before) but that they were all agreed upon that point, &amp;c. That, therefore, no body blamed him; that the city imputed nothing to him, as the &s;ea was not his province. Fox a&s;ked him, from whence he had that news&mdash;he replied, from Garraway's. Fox &s;aid, that, if he could believe any thing he heard, the city were extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with the leaving Minorca expo&s;ed, and that, generally, it would be ever true, tha$ tho&s;e who had the chief direction in a$ Admini&s;tration, would bear the greate&s;$ &s;hare of blame, and that tho&s;e people de|ceived him, who told him it was other|wi&s;e now.

of Commons was &s;atisfied with him; Fox replied, he did not know from whom his Grace had his information of the Hou&s;e of Commons, but it appeared plainly to him, that, when Mr. Pitt charged the lo&s;s of Minorca upon his Grace, and he had de|fended him, as an&s;werable only in an equal degree with others, all their friends hung their heads, and not a man of them was, or &s;eemed to be, per&s;uaded, that a &s;quadron could not be &s;ooner &s;ent, or that all had been done, which could be done. He (Fox) indeed had defended his Grace in every thing where he could defend him; but in one thing, he never could, which was, in his not believing it mu&s;t be war, and in not arming &s;ooner. The Duke &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that nobody could think <HI>him</HI> to blame. Mr. Fox went on and &s;aid, that this intelligence came from Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, who was a weak man, &amp;c. That he thought, he him&s;elf had fully an|&s;wered all that could be expected, or which he had engaged for, and hoped, that I thought &s;o too: but he found by the Duke of Newca&s;tle's whole behaviour to
<PB N="384" REF="396">
him, that the Duke was not at all &s;atisfied with what he had done. Was it not true that the chief in an Admini&s;tration would always be the mo&s;t obnoxious? I an&s;wered, yes: unle&s;s they had any one to make a &s;cape-goat. He &s;eemed alarmed, and a&s;ked me, if I thought him likely to be a &s;cape-goat and dwelt upon the expre&s;&s;ion. I told him, as the truth was, that I had not <HI>him</HI> in any degree, &s;o much as in my con|templation, and I had no &s;uch apprehen|&s;ions. Mr. Fox continued and &s;aid, he was very unea&s;y; that the country was in a &s;ad way, but if it was in a better, tho&s;e, who had the direction of it, could no more carry on this war, than his three children. That he him&s;elf had always hinted at &s;ending a &s;quadron to Minorca &s;ooner; and that the Duke of Cumberland pre&s;&s;ed it &s;trongly, &s;o long ago as la&s;t Chri&s;tmas. I then a&s;ked him, whether there was any truth in the report, that the Princes George and Edward were to be kept at Ken&s;ington. He replied, he fan|cied there were &s;ome grounds for it, but he was not, in the lea&s;t, tru&s;ted or con|&s;ulted
<PB N="385" REF="397">
about it; but he knew (though not from them) that the Duke of Newca&s;tle and the Chancellor had had two conferen|ces upon that &s;ubject, and though private conferences between them were nothing new; for he &s;uppo&s;ed they had them every night; yet, they had had two, particularly on this &s;ubject: and he would inform me how <HI>he</HI> knew it. They were overheard in an entry, enough to learn the &s;ubject of tho&s;e conver&s;ations, though not the re&s;ult of them. That, when every thing was &s;ettled, he &s;uppo&s;ed Lords Holderne&s;&s;e, Waldgrave, and him&s;elf &s;hould be called in, and a minute of it would then be made, and carried to the King as their joint advice. That he was ready to &s;ign, upon any of the King's affairs, how delicate &s;oever: but whether he &s;hould &s;ign as his advice, what others had &s;ettled and dige&s;ted, without having it any way communicated to him, was what he wanted to talk with me about, and to know my opinion. I thought this conver&s;ation much too deli|cate to be holden upon the benches, and I,

once, made him move his place, but he would go on.</P>
<P>I went to the Duke of Newca&s;tle's; he would have talked about what had pa&s;&s;ed, the day before, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, upon the committee of the Million Bill, which gives the Trea&s;ury the unpreceden|ted power of borrowing, without limi|ting the rate of intere&s;t. Sir George Lyttleton's candour in opening it made him inform the Hou&s;e with this dangerous and unnece&s;&s;ary innovation, which produ|ced a debate and divi&s;ion, where the Trea|&s;ury rejected the limitation offered to be in&s;erted, by <HI>one</HI> voice only. None of us were acquainted either with the innovation, or of Sir George's de&s;ign to go into the committee that day, &s;o that the numbers were but 37 and 36. I declined talking with his grace upon the &s;ubject, telling him it was too bad. He pre&s;&s;ed me much to go down to the Report, which I re|ceived coolly, and I changed the &s;ubject to con&s;idering what new encouragement &s;hould be given, as a deputation of mer|chants
<PB N="387" REF="399">
had been with me upon that head. He reque&s;ted me to talk with Lord An&s;on. I then pre&s;&s;ed him about Lord Hallifax. The Duke expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t define to pre&s;erve his Lord&s;hip's friend&s;hip, but prote&s;ted, he could no more get him a blue ribband, than he could get the Kingdom of Ireland for me. I &s;aid, I conceived <HI>that</HI> was the mi&s;take. That though I wi&s;hed Lord Hallifax had the Garter, yet I never mentioned it, or meant it: what I meant, was the Cabinet; Lord Hallifax from &s;tation, &s;ervices, and merit, had a right to it: his Grace's own intere&s;t loud|ly called for it, and could not <HI>he</HI> do that? he &s;trongly declared, he would think of it, and do all he could, as &s;oon as the &s;e&s;&s;ion was concluded: but he had talked with Lord Hallifax's friends, and under&s;tood that the Cabinet would not &s;atisfy him. I replied, make his Lord&s;hip to blame then: &s;hew you have done for him, what every one knows you can and ought to do; and if, at la&s;t, you are to break; break at lea&s;t upon a point where you have &s;ome ground to depend upon, and not where you have none,

in declining to do what you can do, be|cau&s;e you do not attempt what, po&s;&s;ibly, there may be &s;ome doubt about. He was very unea&s;y, and prote&s;ted, with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, that he would do all in his power to oblige Lord Hallifax, as &s;oon as the Parliament ro&s;e.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="23."

Lord Hallifax acquie&s;ced upon that condition; but he under&s;tood, I &s;uppo&s;e, by his private dealings with the Duke of Newca&s;tle, that Robin&s;on was not to accept&mdash;Lord Hallifax writes to Robin&s;on, who an&s;wers him, that he has had &s;ome talk about the matter; but not having re|ceived any account how it would end, can|not give his Lord&s;hip the information he de&s;ires, but at the &s;ame time expre&s;&s;es a wi&s;h to &s;ee him.

<P>N. B. The Duke of Newca&s;tle, prepared, and all along informed by Lord Hallifax (who acted &s;hamefully in the affair) joins Pitt; takes the Trea&s;ury; makes Pitt Se|cretary again; Lord Temple, Privy Seal; Lord An&s;on, the head of the Admiralty; &amp;c. &amp;c. and his Grace tells Lord Hallifax, that it is &s;ettled, he (Hallifax) &s;hould be the third Secretary for the Plantations; which was his Lord&s;hip's object, and for which he had overturned our whole plan. Lord Hallifax tells all his friends of it; he goes to Court and talks to Pitt about it, as a hing &s;ettled: Pitt &s;tared at him, and told
<PB N="397" REF="409">
his Lord&s;hip very coolly, and very truly, that he never had heard one word of it, and he did not conceive, that any body had a right to curtail his office to that degree, which was, already, too much encroached upon by the Board. Lord Hallifax, covered with confu&s;ion, goes away in a rage, writes an angry letter to the Duke of Newca&s;tle, complains to the King, but meeting no great comfort, he re&s;igns&mdash;but a&s;ks one or two things for his friends, and is refu&s;ed. The Duke of Newca&s;tle, as Lord Hallifax &s;ays, behaved with the utmo&s;t meanne&s;s; he owned he had not &s;poke to Pitt about it, and that his rea&s;on was, <HI>Pitt looked &s;o much out of humour, that he dur&s;t not</HI>. Lord Hallifax talked of his Grace every where in the mo&s;t opprobrious terms, as the ob|ject of his contempt and dete&s;tation&mdash;<HI>but</HI> as his Grace had not filled up the office, his Lord&s;hip, about Michaelmas, conde|&s;cended to take it up again, ju&s;t as he left it.</P>
<P>The King kept his word with Fox, and
<PB N="398" REF="410">
made him Payma&s;ter&mdash;but his Maje&s;ty was not plea&s;ed to behave &s;o to me.</P>
<P>Thus ended this attempt to deliver the King from hands he did not like, and it failed from Lord Hallifax's duplicity, which drew a greater affront upon him, than I ever remember offered to any body; from the Duke of Newca&s;tle's treachery and in|gratitude, who, after having given his word to the King, that he would never join Mr. Pitt, but by his Maje&s;ty's con&s;ent, forced the King to con&s;ent; and by his Maje&s;ty's timidity, who dared not to &s;upport any body, even in his own cau&s;e.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Sept.">The &s;ecret expedition was founded on the information of one Clarke, a Lieutenant in the Train, who told the Mini&s;try that he pa&s;&s;ed through the place &s;ome years ago, and was &s;hewn the works, as an Engli&s;h officer, by order of the Governor: that the ditch was dry; the fortifications, garri&s;on, &amp;c. &s;uch as might be taken by &s;torm.

The council was then unanimous, that the

attempt upon the place was impracticable. The difficulties of landing at the new di&s;|covered &s;pot were very great&mdash;the tran&s;|ports could not come within a mile and a half of the &s;hore&mdash;the &s;hips of war not within a league&mdash;there was a row of &s;and banks upon the &s;hore, &s;ufficient to conceal a number of men&mdash;the pilot, who had lived there, &s;aid, that he had known a we&s;tern gale blow off &s;hore, for &s;even weeks toge|ther, &s;o &s;tiff that no boat could land upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>However, Mordaunt, though refu&s;ed the protection of one &s;hip, but terrified, perhaps, with the fate of Byng, re&s;olved to land wherever he could, to try to take Fouras and look at Rochefort.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="26." UNIT="Sept.">Spent in looking after better landings, but finding none, Mordaunt embarks his troops the 28th, at night, but the wind made it unadvi&s;eable to land. The next day, Hawke declared that if Mordaunt would take upon him&s;elf the con&s;equences of keeping the great &s;hips out, at that &s;ea&s;on
<PB N="401" REF="413">
of the year, he would &s;tay; otherwi&s;e, he mu&s;t go home. Mordaunt would not do that, &s;o they returned together. And thus ended this expedition, contrived with &s;o much &s;ecrecy, that every thing, nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;ucce&s;s, was a &s;ecret to the contriver him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As a proof of this, a year afterwards, when Mordaunt (who certainly &s;hould have had living witne&s;&s;es of the futility of the plan) had been brought to a trial, and, al&s;o, worried by all the low Court flatter|ers and &s;criblers, it happened that Capt. Dennis took the Rai&s;onable, commanded by the Chevalier de Rohan. Mr. Fox told me, that being with Lords Waldegrave and Gower together, they both told him, that Dennis had a&s;&s;ured each of them &s;e|parately, that his pri&s;oner, the Chevalier de Rohan, had told him, that he (the Chevalier) was at that time in Rochfort, or la Rochelle, (the Lords in comparing notes had no other doubt in their narrative) and that our enemy had 7 or 8000 men there at lea&s;t. That there were 3,500 men
<PB N="402" REF="414">
behind the &s;and-banks, and there was a ma&s;ked battery at each end. That, if we had landed when we fir&s;t appeared, we &s;hould have embarra&s;&s;ed them. But they thought them&s;elves betrayed, when they found we did not land at the time we at|tempted it.</P>
<P>Late in the Autumn this year, the army, that was &s;uppo&s;ed to remain in a &s;tate of inactivity by treaty, took the field again under Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, the Duke of Cumberland and his treaty being di&s;owned by the King.</P>
<P>In the month of June or July, Sir George Lee told me (which was confirmed after|wards by Lord Hallifax) that he had been more than once &s;ollicited to be Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Duke of Newca&s;tle, in the Admini&s;tration he was then negoci|ating. That Sir George con&s;ented not without difficulty. That the Friday before Whit&s;unday he was at Newca&s;tle Hou&s;e, and the Duke told him, that all was &s;ettled in general with the King, and that he was
<PB N="403" REF="415">
to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Duke &s;hewed him, what he &s;aid was, the li&s;t in detail, which he was going to carry to the King at Ken&s;ington, and de&s;ired to &s;ee Sir George the next morning. Upon Sir George's telling him, that he was to go next morning to his brother in Bucks, the Duke pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;tay. His Grace was a&s;ked, if he did not go to the Hou&s;e of Lords from Ken&s;ington&mdash;yes&mdash;Sir George met him there, and the Duke told him all was &s;ettled, and that the King a|greed in form to his being Chancellor of the Exchequer; upon which they parted, Sir George being to return on Monday or Tue&s;day. When he came back to Town, he found the &s;y&s;tem entirely altered, and another Chancellor of the Exchequer (Legge) made part of it. And Sir George further told me, that he never had had any communication from, or with the Duke of Newca&s;tle, either by word of mouth, note, me&s;&s;age, or common friend, &s;ince his parting from him at the Hou&s;e of Lords, till Sunday the 16th July, the day but one preceding our conver&s;ation, when the
<PB N="404" REF="416">
Duke came and &s;ate down by him at Lei|ce&s;ter Hou&s;e, and, with all the ea&s;e and familiarity of an old friend, communicated his no news to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Martin informed me, that Holborne was very willing to agree with Lord Lou|don, in not attacking Loui&s;bourg. And that An&s;on, &s;ince he la&s;t came in, had told the Mini&s;try, that Holborne went out with no better &s;tomach for fighting than Byng. That, at a meeting of the Lords, Newca&s;tle, Hardwick, Holderne&s;&s;e, An&s;on, and Mr. Pitt, it was propo&s;ed to &s;end the armament, then preparing again&s;t Rochefort, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Royal Highne&s;s in Ger|many, on account of the Duke's ill &s;ucce&s;s upon the Continent: that every man was for it, except Mr. Pitt, who in&s;i&s;ted, if that re&s;olution was to prevail, that minutes of the meeting &s;hould be taken, and his di&s;&s;ent entered. Upon which the others de&s;i&s;ted; but no one would acquaint the King with the re&s;ult, and Mr. Pitt was left to do it him&s;elf. He further told me, that the King had &s;aid, his revenues were
<PB N="405" REF="417">
&s;eized, that he was 800,000<HI>l.</HI> in debt, and that the Army mu&s;t di&s;band, if it was not &s;upplied from hence: and that Pitt had con&s;ented to give him 100,000<HI>l.</HI> and 20,000<HI>l.</HI> to &s;ub&s;i&s;t his daughter.</P>
<P>Lord Hallifax told me the following hi&s;tory of his friend Legge. In&s;tigated, as I &s;uppo&s;e, by his Lord&s;hip and O&s;wald, (who hoped to enhance their favour with the Duke of Newca&s;tle, while the negoci|ation with Mr. Pitt was open, by their bringing over &s;o con&s;iderable a per&s;on) and following the low, &s;huffling di&s;po&s;ition of his own heart, Mr. Legge met a little be|fore Ea&s;ter, the Duke of Newca&s;tle, at Lord Dupplin's, coming in at the back door through the park, at nine o'clock. That meeting pa&s;&s;ed in a&s;&s;urances of good-will to each other, and went no farther. That the Duke propo&s;ed another, which Legge was afraid to hazard, but the corre&s;pon|dence was kept up by me&s;&s;age. This treaty was for Legge to come in, without Mr. Pitt, if the latter per&s;i&s;ted in his exor|bitant demands.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="418">The Duke of Newca&s;tle chiefly treated with Mr. Pitt by the Primate of Ireland, Stone. One day, in the beginning of the negociation, when Lord Bute and Mr. Pitt were in conference with the Primate, and in&s;i&s;ted upon very extravagant terms, the Primate beg'd them as a friend, to be a little more moderate, and, before they went &s;o far, to con&s;ider whether they were &s;ure of <HI>all</HI> their friends. They were &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;aid, they thought &s;o. He replied, that he thought otherwi&s;e, and could, if he would, <HI>(for he was authori&s;ed to do it)</HI> tell them a very different &s;tory. Mr. Pitt immediately in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing it, or he would treat no farther. Upon which, the Primate told them this private tran&s;ac|tion of Legge with the Duke of Newca&s;tle. This di&s;covery occa&s;ioned great coolne&s;s to Legge at Leice&s;ter Hou&s;e, which, as &s;oon as he perceived, gave him much un|ea&s;ine&s;s. At la&s;t (I think from Lord Hallifax) Legge found out, that, in return for his thinking of leaving his friends for the Duke of Newca&s;tle, the Duke had be|trayed him to them. He would have ex|po&s;tulated
<PB N="407" REF="419">
with his friends, but they would not &s;uffer it, and, the negociation taking place in their favour, they bade him take the exchequer &s;eals under the Duke of Newca&s;tle, and enter into no further ec|clairci&s;&s;ement. He has done &s;o, detected by Mr. Pitt and Leice&s;ter Hou&s;e; acting under one, whom he hates; who hates him, and has betrayed him; breaking faith with Lord Hallifax, without whom he engaged him&s;elf not to act; and with O&s;wald, to whom he had pledged his honour, never to come into the Trea&s;ury without him.

In which ca&s;e, he &s;hould propo&s;e Lord Percival in his room. All this appeared to me &s;o &s;trange, that I a&s;ked Lord Bute about it. He, after putting me in mind that he had told me, a week ago, that there never was a thought of making Lord Eg|mont a Peer, or that even any application had been made, &s;aid, that very lately Lord Egmont had been with him, and beg'd earne&s;tly to go into the Hou&s;e of Lords&mdash; that his election at Bridgewater was very uncertain&mdash;that he was very ill, and much dejected, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That he (Bute) told him there was very little encouragement, and told me that the King was very little di&s;po&s;ed: he a&s;ked me, what I would do in his election, to which I replied, throw him out. Lord Bute &s;eemed to think it hard he &s;hould be in neither hou&s;e. Perceiving that, I &s;aid that, if the King would keep him out of the Hou&s;e of Lords, and he (Bute) de&s;ired it, I would &s;ecure his election at Bridgewa|ter. He &s;aid, it was too much for me to give up family intere&s;t. I replied, nothing
<PB N="422" REF="434">
is too much that is u&s;eful, where friend&s;hip is real and mutual.&mdash;And here it now &s;tands.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1761.">Lord Bute came and &s;aid, he was &s;ure <MILESTONE N="2." UNIT="Jan.">that the Mini&s;try had &s;ome glimp&s;e of get|ting off our &s;y&s;tem, by &s;etting up that of abandoning Hanover, and of applying the money to di&s;tre&s;s France into a peace; that they would, by their popularity, force this mea&s;ure upon the King, who mu&s;t con&s;e|quently lo&s;e a great deal of his own. I told him, as the truth was, that this mea&s;ure was the only &s;ound one to get out of the war. That I had ye&s;terday begun to put my thoughts upon it into writing, to per|&s;uade him to obtain powers of the King to carry it into execution. That my only doubt was, whether the new Parliament &s;hould not be &s;uffered to meet, only to de|clare in the &s;peech that his Maje&s;ty found him&s;elf involved in this war, to which he had no ways contributed: that, &s;eeing the bent of the nation &s;o violent, he had ac|quie&s;ced in it, without approving of it, per&s;uaded that they would &s;oon feel, if
<PB N="423" REF="435">
they did not &s;ee, their error: that he was convinced that the pre&s;ent method of de|fending Hanover would ruin this country, without defending that; and he therefore would no longer expo&s;e his regal domini|ons to &s;uch hard&s;hips, for fruitle&s;s at|tempts to protect his electoral; but would leave them in the hands of his enemies, and apply the expence to force them to a rea&s;onable peace, by means more probable and proper to attain that end.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed a con&s;iderable time, and did not &s;ay po&s;itively, that he could, or could not, get the King to con&s;ent to this &s;y&s;tem, but he returned to &s;ay, that he thought the Mini&s;try had an eye that way. If &s;uch &s;hould be their &s;cheme, I &s;aid, it would be irre&s;i&s;tible; but there was one way to defeat the u&s;e they propo&s;ed from it, which was, to put him&s;elf at the head of it, in a great office of bu&s;ine&s;s, and to take the lead, and the merit of bringing with him the true Briti&s;h principles of making war, peace, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="436">Lord Bute &s;aid, that, tho' he was &s;ure the Mini&s;try looked that way, he hoped and believed they would not ea&s;ily follow it: that I, indeed, always talked of them, as if they were united, whereas they neither were nor could be. That the Duke of Newca&s;tle mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;hed for peace, and would go any lengths to attain it. That Mr. Pitt meditated a retreat, and would &s;tay in no longer than the war.</P>
<P>But, for my part, I think they will con|tinue the war as long as they can; and keep in, when it is over, as long as they can; and that will be, as long as they plea&s;e, if they are &s;uffered to make peace, which will &s;oon be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to all orders and conditions of men, that all will be glad of it, be it what it will, e&s;pecially if it comes from tho&s;e, who have all the offices and the powers of office. All which can never end well for the King and Lord Bute. His Lord&s;hip now &s;hewed me a letter to Lord Egmont, which he wrote in the King's pre&s;ence, &s;aying, "that the King is re&s;ol|ved to make no more Peers, at pre&s;ent,
<PB N="425" REF="437">
than tho&s;e now before him; that if his Lord&s;hip thinks his per&s;onal application to his Maje&s;ty will make him alter this re&s;olution, he hoped his Lord&s;hip would take that &s;tep: and then added, if you think your election uncertain, and I can be of any &s;ervice to you in it <HI>(as I think I can)</HI> your Lord&s;hip may command me." I hope he will not accept the &s;ervice offered.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip then &s;aid, he was per&s;ua|ded it would be &s;een this very winter, if the Mini&s;try endeavoured to prolong the war; for he thought, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia him&s;elf would in&s;i&s;t upon their making a peace, and even a &s;eparate peace.</P>
<P>This I confe&s;s, I do not under&s;tand&mdash; we agreed upon getting runners, and to &s;ettle what we &s;hould di&s;per&s;e.</P>
<P>I dined at Sir Francis Da&s;hwood's.<MILESTONE N="9." UNIT="Jan."> Lord Bute came, and he &s;hewed me Lord Egmont's an&s;wer: he is di&s;plea&s;ed, but de|&s;ires to know, if he is to under&s;tand his Maje&s;ty refu&s;es him the Peerage for ever,
<PB N="426" REF="438">
or for this time only. We are now quit of his Lord&s;hip. Lord Bute thinks the French will make a &s;eparate peace upon the pre&s;ent foot&mdash;I think not&mdash;and I en|deavoured to &s;hew him, that nothing but ruin could flow from our per&s;i&s;ting in the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures; nothing could produce peace, but withdrawing from the Conti|nent; that it mu&s;t be, either from nece&s;|&s;ity, or from being driven into it by tho&s;e, who brought this ruin upon us, or from a petition to the throne by the united voice of his Maje&s;ty's be&s;t &s;ubjects. But, at all events, it ought to appear, that the giving up Hanover was his Maje&s;ty's own &s;y&s;tem; and therefore in ca&s;e any thing, that looked that way, &s;hould be moved, he (Bute) &s;hould be prepared to take the lead, and that he and I &s;hould begin the affair in the Hou&s;e of Lords. I wi&s;h I may have con|vinced him. I had written, and afterwards I mentioned Lord Talbot's &s;on in law to &s;ucceed Bo&s;cawen who was dying. He was &s;orry, I had not thought of it &s;ooner, but he had agreed to fill his place by a re|moval out of the board of trade. I tried to
<PB N="427" REF="439">
get the Jewel Office for him by an arrange|ment for Lord Lyttleton&mdash;but in vain. We wi&s;hed to have &s;ome coffee-hou&s;e &s;pies, but I do not know how to contrive it.</P>
<P>Lord Bute came, and &s;aid, that he was<MILESTONE N="16." UNIT="Jan."> now &s;ure that Pitt had no thoughts of aban|doning the Continent, and that he was madder than ever. He was unea&s;y with Talbot, as he would have put the Steward's &s;taff into Talbot's hands the fir&s;t day if he could. That he had heard that Talbot thought Granby could per&s;uade his father to quit it, and that, otherwi&s;e, he would not accept it, on account of the friend&s;hip between him and Granby. That Talbot would make an excellent officer to reform that mo&s;t corrupt office. That, in what|ever he (Bute) &s;hould do for his friends, he &s;hould always, at the &s;ame time, con&s;i|der the &s;ervice of his ma&s;ter and of the public. I pre&s;&s;ed him much for Lord Talbot, to which he replied, that he had marks of all the di&s;tinctions that were going. The Council accepted, and refu&s;ed
<PB N="428" REF="440">
in the promotions of Peerage, an Earldom. That he perceived, Lord Talbot meant a place of more con&s;equence than he (Bute) wi&s;hed. He was &s;orry for it&mdash;for he was violent, and I might depend upon it, he would be impracticable in bu&s;ine&s;s. That Lord Talbot had u&s;ed him unkindly. I &s;aid all I could, and from my heart. I touched again upon Rice&mdash;he &s;aid, he thought the board of trade no improper beginning, and that, po&s;&s;ibly, might be &s;haped out. I &s;aid, the offer of any thing directly from him, accepted or not accepted, I thought would be very kindly taken. That Henley owed his being made Chancellor, from Keeper, entirely to him, and that he had brought Henley's letter to &s;hew me. I beg'd his Lord&s;hip to pre|&s;erve that letter, as well as &s;ome others, he had &s;hewn me, properly labelled and tied up: for the ingratitude of mankind might make it of u&s;e to have pre&s;erved them. He &s;miled, and &s;aid he had already &s;ound it &s;o: and then told me Martin's impertinent conver&s;ation at the Admiralty, in pre&s;ence of a dozen people, about a line
<PB N="429" REF="441">
to be drawn between the Scotch and the Engli&s;h, and that it ought to be ob&s;erved and continued.</P>
<P>Lord Bute then &s;aid, that he mu&s;t &s;ee the Duke of Newca&s;tle, to &s;ettle with him, about the elections, &s;hortly. That, to tho&s;e, who had propo&s;ed to him to unite with the Duke upon conditions, he had &s;aid; he would agree to no conditions till he &s;aw Talbot, Da&s;hwood and Charles Town&s;hend, (which la&s;t, he &s;aid, had &s;worn allegiance to him, <HI>for a time)</HI> had &s;uch places as he wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>As to the army, he wi&s;hed he could $alk with an impartial officer: that he thought the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and Prince Ferdinand were as popular as ever. I an|&s;wered, that I thought the King of Pru&s;&s;ia began to be very little &s;o: and that there was &s;omething &s;o &s;ervile in the education of an officer, that, if the officer found out what he de&s;ired to hear, he might be &s;ure of hearing nothing el&s;e. That I thought Prince Ferdinand was become as unpopular
<PB N="430" REF="442">
in the army, as he was once popular&mdash;that he was accu&s;ed of three great heads of malver&s;ation. The fir&s;t was, that he had exacted complete pay for uncomplete corps: the &s;econd, that not one &s;hilling of all tho&s;e deva&s;tating contributions had been carried to the publick account: the third, that he had received good money, and had paid the troops in bad, to a very great amount, and at a great di&s;count: that this la&s;t was an affair mercantile and of exchange&mdash;and that, if the charge was true, I would undertake to find tho&s;e, who &s;hould lay it open to the world beyond contradiction. Lord Bute's notions about the war are very &s;ingular, and, I believe, not throughly dige&s;ted: he thinks, the ene|my will make a peace upon the pre&s;ent foot|ing, if we go on conquering their i&s;lands, &amp;c. I think, that they will never make peace with us, till we withdraw our troops actually, or till they think we de&s;ign it. His opinion is, that withdrawing our troops would either effect a peace, or ena|ble us to carry on a war much cheaper, and by national means for national ends;
<PB N="431" REF="443">
but what compen&s;ation is to be made for Hanover? I replied according to the da|mage done, and the foundation mu&s;t be, how much heavier the taxation of the electorate has been, than what it was un|der its natural Prince. He &s;aid, that, if we made this &s;eparate peace, we mu&s;t &s;till pay the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, which would make the war look more unnational. I thought not, but then, he &s;aid, we mu&s;t &s;top here, and not think of conquering any farther. I an&s;wered, I &s;aw nothing to conquer, that France had as much lo&s;t Martinico, as &s;he could lo&s;e it&mdash;that the French government had not received a &s;ixpence from the duties, nor the &s;ubjects from their e&s;tates, the&s;e two years. He &s;aid, all the produce came home in neutral &s;hips. He then returned to the difficul|ties of indemnifying Hanover, if the troops &s;hould be withdrawn and the peace be made. And this makes me doubt, whether the King can be brought to aban|don Hanover, which &s;eems to me to be the only method to &s;ecure a good peace to that country, as well as to this.</P>

I then a&s;ked if he had &s;ettled the new Parliament with the Duke? he replied, he had not &s;een his Grace for &s;ome days, but &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould &s;oon, and he would then bring his li&s;t with him. That what were ab&s;olutely the King's boroughs, the King would name to; but where the Crown had only an in|fluence, as by the cu&s;toms, exci&s;e, &amp;c. he could not be refu&s;ed the di&s;po&s;ition of it, while he &s;tayed in.

His Lord&s;hip was not for pu&s;hing them yet, for if the peace was a bad one, as it mu&s;t be, they would cer|tainly proclaim, that it was owing to their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e they were not &s;uffered to bring the great work to a happy con|clu&s;ion, to whom the glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which had hitherto attended their conduct|ing it, were entirely to be attributed.

We agreed that, if there was nothing irregular to be done, the new Parliament would be the King's, let who will chu&s;e it: he &s;aid, it was very ea&s;y to make the Duke of Newca&s;tle re&s;ign, and he did not imagine, that his Grace would do it in any ho&s;tile way, or make tho&s;e, whom he elected, oppo&s;e the Mini&s;|try.

<P>HERE the Diary concludes; but it is much to be re|gretted, that his Lord&s;hip did not continue it, during the very intere&s;ting period, which immediately preceded his de|cea&s;e. The confidential letters in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and his Lord|&s;hip's an&s;wers to them (both of which he mo&s;t carefully pre|&s;erved) might a&s;&s;i&s;t me in carrying on the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, till within a month of his death: but, as I have nei|ther lei&s;ure for &s;uch an undertaking, nor &s;ufficient knowledge of that memorable aera, to enable me to &s;elect or dige&s;t the letters properly, I think it prudent to decline &s;o arduous a ta&s;k; a ta&s;k, indeed, that would have been attended with almo&s;t in&s;uperable difficulties: for we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e that, in a written intercour&s;e between his Lord&s;hip and men of various principles, many of the letters and an&s;wers would $nvey repre&s;entations, very contradictory to th$&s;e of others.</P>

<P>THE en&s;uing Narrative is, by &s;ome years, prior to the earlie&s;t date of the Diary; but, as it is fre|quently alluded to in the work, the Editor has in&s;erted it in this Appendix; and he doubts not, that every hone&s;t man will unite with him in the patriotick wi&s;h, that this country may never again be di&s;tracted with di&s;&s;entions, &s;imilar to tho&s;e, which were the con&s;equences of the following tran&s;action.</P>
<P>For &s;uch was the fatality of tho&s;e unnatural di&s;&s;entions, that the judicious and provident part of the nation, and, alas! a Father too, could be ju&s;tified in rejoicing, that a Prince of Wales was numbered with the dead.</P>

<HEAD><DATE>FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1736-7.</DATE> A NARRATIVE OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN The PRINCE and Mr. DODINGTON; AND AFTERWARDS BETWEEN Sir ROBERT WALPOLE and Mr. DODINGTON: UPON The re&s;olution of his Royal Highne&s;s to bring a demand into Parliament, for an augmentation of his allowance to 100,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> and for a jointure upon the Prince&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>ON Monday, the 7th of February, 1736-7, being informed that the Prince went to bed indi&s;po&s;ed, I thought it my duty to go to his lodgings next morn|ing (Thur&s;day the 8th) to enquire of the Pages of the Back Stairs, after his health. I found his &s;addle hor&s;es in the Court; they told me he was pretty well, and in&s;i&s;ted upon letting his Royal Highne&s;s know I was there. I would not admit of it, being obliged, that morning, to attend the Trea&s;ury, and the Hou&s;e; but, before my coach could drive off, one of the Pages, overtook me with a me&s;&s;age from the Prince to at|tend him.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="450">I found him with the &s;ervants in waiting about him, his boots on, and powdering his hair, to ride out. After having fini&s;hed his dre&s;s, he directed the gentlemen to withdraw; and then, with his u&s;ual goodne&s;s, was plea&s;ed to talk to me very freely, upon the &s;tate of his Maje&s;ty's indi&s;po&s;ition, and upon &s;everal other &s;ubjects, relating to tran&s;actions, and per&s;ons, of a publick nature.</P>
<P>After half an hour &s;pent in this kind of conver&s;a|tion, I humbly offered to take my leave, but he com|manded me to &s;it down again, and then &s;aid that he would communicate a &s;ecret to me of great importance, in which he &s;hould de&s;ire my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and de&s;igned partly to employ me. I an&s;wered, that if his Royal Highne&s;s was plea&s;ed to tru&s;t me with a &s;ecret, I had one favour to a&s;k, which was that he would tell it to nobody el&s;e, and then I would be an&s;werable it &s;hould remain a &s;ecret. He told me that it was not of that nature; that it would be known; that &s;everal people now knew it; but that no one &s;ervant of the Crown, as he believed, was acquainted with it: that having always had more kindne&s;s, and affection for me, than for any body, he thought he owed it me, (as he was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s him&s;elf) to communicate it to me, the fir&s;t of any of the King's &s;ervants, and by his own mouth: that tho&s;e who were chiefly concerned, and engaged in it, were appri&s;ed of this his re&s;olution, and not only approved, but even advi&s;ed, that I &s;hould be the fir&s;t of the Court made acquainted with it.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="451">Exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed as I was at this unexpected prelude, I only returned thanks, in the be&s;t manner I was able, for the gracious and conde&s;cending expre&s;|&s;ions he was plea&s;ed to u&s;e, and really did not gue&s;s (as I naturally might have done, if I had not been &s;ur|pri&s;ed) what it tended to. He then entered into very bitter complaints of the u&s;age he had, all along, met with from the Admini&s;tration, and even from their Maje&s;ties: that he was not allowed wherewithall to live, &amp;c. that he was re&s;olved to endure it no longer, and had determined to make a demand in Parliament of a jointure for the Prince&s;s, and of 100,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> for him&s;elf, which his father had, when Prince, and which he looked on to be his right, both in law and equity. I objected to the very great danger of &s;uch an undertaking; put his Royal Highne&s;s in mind, how &s;trongly I had always been again&s;t it, when he for|merly mentioned it; and was going to &s;hew the fatal con&s;equences it mu&s;t produce, be&s;ides the great impro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s. But he interrupted me, and &s;aid, that it was too far gone for tho&s;e con&s;iderations; that he did not a&s;k my advice, but my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he was determined upon the mea&s;ure, and de&s;igned to &s;end and &s;peak with my particular friends, namely, Sir Paul Methuen, Lord Wilmington, and the Duke of Dor&s;et; but cho&s;e out of kindne&s;s to me, to acquaint me, fir&s;t with it: that he would &s;end to Sir Paul by Sir Thomas Frankland, and a&s;ked me, if I would break the matter to them, and what, I believed, they would think of it. Sen&s;ible of the danger and diffi|culties that attend negociations of this delicate na|ture,
<PB N="442" REF="452">
even among the be&s;t friends, I replied, as to the fir&s;t part, that I humbly beg'd to be excu&s;ed from breaking it; that whatever friend&s;hip tho&s;e gentlemen did me the honour to admit me to, I thought it a matter too high to undertake: that, as he had men|tioned his intentions of &s;ending to them, and as they were, by their rank, and affection to his Royal High|ne&s;s, every way qualified to be con&s;ulted, I thought it highly proper that he &s;hould know their &s;entiments from their own mouths, in an affair of this very great importance; that then, what they &s;aid to his Royal Highne&s;s, could not be mi&s;taken, and what he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay to them, could not be mi&s;repre&s;ented. As to what they would think of it, I was confident, by what I felt my&s;elf, that they would be infinitely &s;urpri&s;ed; too much &s;o, in my judgment, to give his Royal Highne&s;s any po&s;itive and determinate opinion. He &s;aid, he did not want their opinion, but their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and what would my friend the Duke of Argyll do? Be extremely &s;urpri&s;ed too, without all doubt, Sir, I replied; I do not know what he will do, but I am confident, I know what he would not do, which is, he would not advi&s;e your Royal Highne&s;s to this mea&s;ure. He an&s;wered, that the mea&s;ure was fixed, that he was re&s;olved, and wanted no advice, but he would not &s;end to him, nor to Lord Scarborough, but to the Duke of Dor&s;et, and Lord Wilmington he would &s;end, being re&s;olved it &s;hould come into the Hou&s;e of Lords the &s;ame day, or &s;oon after, let the fate of it be what it would in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons. He &s;topped here a little, and u&s;ed &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="443" REF="453">
as if he would have me under&s;tand, that he had &s;aid enough about all tho&s;e that he thought I lived with, in the clo&s;e&s;t connection. I endeavoured, after a&s;&s;uring him with what affectionate duty we had always been his &s;incere &s;ervants, to &s;hew the great improba|bility of &s;ucce&s;s in &s;uch an undertaking; but he cut me &s;hort, and &s;aid, None at all, that there were prece|dents for it; and mentioned that of the Prince&s;s of Denmark, in King William's time: that all the op|po&s;ition, and the Tories were engaged in it: that as it was his own determination, and he had been advi&s;ed by nobody, when he had re&s;olved it in his own mind, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak to people him&s;elf; he had done &s;o, to Mr. Pultency, Lord Carteret, Lord Che&s;terfield, Ma&s;ter of the Rolls (Jekyll,) and Sir William Wyndham; that they were all hearty in it; that Mr. Pulteney, at the fir&s;t notice, expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf &s;o hand&s;omely, that he &s;hould never forget it: but &s;aid he could, at that time, only an&s;wer for him|&s;elf, not expecting the propo&s;ition, but beg'd leave to con&s;ult with &s;ome of his friends; which his Royal Highne&s;s granted him, and he had, &s;ince, a&s;&s;ured him that they were unanimous: that Sir William Wynd|ham had &s;aid, that he had long de&s;ired an opportunity of &s;hewing his regard, and attachment to his Royal Highne&s;s; that he would an&s;wer for his whole party, as well as for him&s;elf; and that he was very happy, that an occa&s;ion pre&s;ented it&s;elf to convince his Royal Highne&s;s, by their zealous and hearty appearance in &s;upport of his intere&s;t, how far they were from being Jacobites, and how much they were mi&s;repre&s;ented
<PB N="444" REF="454">
under that name. [N. B. He &s;poke in the debate, but did not vote, and forty-five Tories were ab&s;ent.] That Lord Winchel&s;ea was gone down to Petworth, to bring up the Duke of Somer&s;et, who he thought would move it in the Hou&s;e of Lords: that Mr. Sandys, Sir Thomas Saunder&s;on, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Waller, Sir John Barnard, and &s;everal others were acquainted with it, and highly approved it: that, po&s;&s;ibly, Sir John Barnard might move it. He then a&s;ked me, if I had really heard nothing of it from the Court. I a&s;&s;ured him, with great truth, that I had not; from whence he was plea&s;ed to infer, how generally odious the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t be, that nobody would tell him a thing that &s;o nearly concerned him, when by his Royal Highne&s;s's calculation of tho&s;e that knew it, and a&s;ked leave to con&s;ult their friends, there could not be le&s;s than from forty-&s;ix to fifty that mu&s;t be acquainted with it: he added, that it would make an end of his power, or to that effect, which I had no rea&s;on to be &s;orry for. I told him that, indeed, I had no rea&s;on, nor did I pretend to be partial to the Mini&s;ter, but it was my misfortune to differ &s;o far with his Royal Highne&s;s, that I thought this mea&s;ure would be the mo&s;t effectual one to &s;ecure and &s;trengthen him. He &s;eemed much &s;urpri&s;ed at that, and a&s;ked my rea&s;on. I &s;aid I thought &s;o, becau&s;e the Mini&s;ter had, I believed, long &s;ince experienced, that he could have no hopes of governing by the approbation, and affection, of the people: that his only &s;ecurity, therefore, was his fa|vour, and hold at Court: and in my poor opinion, this unhappy mea&s;ure would make the King's cau&s;e, and
<PB N="445" REF="455">
his, in&s;eparable, and rivet him yet fa&s;ter, where his only &s;trength lay. I then humbly beg'd him to con&s;i|der the circum&s;tance of time; how far it might be con&s;i&s;tent with the known greatne&s;s and genero&s;ity of his character, to make &s;uch an attack, when his father was in a langui&s;hing condition. He replied, that he was &s;en&s;ible of that, but he could not help it: he was engaged, and would go through: the King could not live many years, but might linger thus a good while, and he could not &s;tay that while: that the time, indeed, had its in|conveniencies of one &s;ort, and he wi&s;hed it otherwi&s;e, but it had its conveniencies of another; it would make people more cautious, and apprehen&s;ive of offending him: that, be&s;ides, he had told the Queen of it in the &s;ummer, and a&s;&s;ured her that he de&s;igned to bring it into Parliament; that &s;he had treated it as idle, and chimerical; that it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould make any thing of it, and &s;eemed to think he was only in je&s;t: that if his friends &s;tood by him, he &s;hould carry it in the Hou&s;e, but if he mi&s;&s;ed there, he could not fail of it, in &s;ix months: that I &s;hould know the family as well as any body; he always thought I did; but found that I did not, or would not; but he him|&s;elf knew his own family be&s;t, and he would make a bet that, if he failed, now, he gained his point in le&s;s than a twelvemonth, by this means: in &s;hort, he was re&s;olved, and too far engaged in honour to go back: that it was his due, and his right; ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make him ea&s;y the re&s;t of his life: he could never want his friends but on this occa&s;ion: tho&s;e that would &s;tand by him in this, he &s;hould always look on as his
<PB N="446" REF="456">
friends, and reward as &s;uch; tho&s;e that would not, he &s;hould not reckon to be &s;o, they would have no|thing to expect from him; and &s;everal other expre&s;&s;ions to that purpo&s;e: that it was to be brought in, &s;oon; in what &s;hape, whether by addre&s;s, or otherwi&s;e, he believed was not yet &s;ettled, but &s;oon it mu&s;t be. I made no particular an&s;wer to this la&s;t part, but only expre&s;&s;ed my concern for the con&s;equences, and wait|ing on him down &s;tairs to his hor&s;e, beg'd of him to con&s;ider, how nece&s;&s;ary it was to delay it from the great impropriety of the time. He &s;aid, if a little time would do, it might be con&s;idered, but the King might linger out the &s;e&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame way. I took the liberty to a&s;k what would be the ill con&s;equence if that &s;hould happen, and it &s;hould go over to another &s;e&s;&s;ion. He &s;aid that could not be, his honour was too far engaged, he could not, he would not &s;tay.</P>
<P>Here this conver&s;ation ended, without any direct de|mand to vote for this propo&s;al, on his &s;ide; and with|out any direct promi&s;e, or refu&s;al, on mine: and I left his Royal Highne&s;s with very great unea&s;ine&s;s, and perplexity upon my mind, con&s;iderably augmented by the great ea&s;e and tranquility that appeared upon his; which is the natural effect of great re&s;olutions, when they are fixed and determined.</P>
<P>Upon reflection on what had pa&s;&s;ed, finding it was re&s;olved to apply, per&s;onally to the Duke of Dor&s;et, Lord Wilmington, and Sir Paul Methuen, I thought it a duty of the friend&s;hip in which we had, &s;o many
<PB N="447" REF="457">
years, lived, to prepare them for &s;o di&s;agreeable a con|ference: and fir&s;t, as he was to be called on, the next day but one, I acquainted Sir Paul Methuen with it. We joined in lamenting the fate of this country, to be divided and torn to pieces by a di&s;union in this Royal family, which, with &s;o many ardent wi&s;hes, with the profu&s;ion of &s;o much blood, and trea&s;ure, we had, at la&s;t, &s;o happily placed on the throne, to end all our divi|&s;ions, and protect us in union and tranquility. We agreed that Sir Paul Methuen &s;hould not &s;eem to be any ways appri&s;ed of the cau&s;e of &s;ending for him, but &s;hould lay hold on all overtures that &s;hould be given him, to repre&s;ent &s;trongly to his Royal Highne&s;s the very fatal con&s;equences of this undertaking; and by no means give him any the lea&s;t rea&s;on, or encourage|ment to think, that he would vote for it.</P>
<P>I then opened the matter to the Lords. We had &s;everal conferences upon it; and agreed to communi|cate it to Lord Scarborough, by the Duke of Dor&s;et. The Lords unanimou&s;ly agreed to do their utmo&s;t to prevent this ill-advi&s;ed attempt (if they were &s;ent to,) and not to be hindered by any interruptions, from repre|&s;enting &s;trongly to his Royal Highne&s;s, the fatal con|&s;equences of it. But in ca&s;e he per&s;i&s;ted in it, to declare plainly to him, that they &s;hould think them&s;elves obliged in con&s;cience, and in honour to oppo&s;e it, as fatal to his Royal Highne&s;s, injurious to the King, and de&s;tructive to the quiet and tranquility of the whole country; and de&s;ired me to do &s;o too, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be my lot to be fir&s;t called upon.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="458">Sir P. Methuen was not &s;ent for on Thur&s;day, which gave me &s;ome hopes (vain ones indeed) that the great coldne&s;s I had received the propo&s;ition with, might have had &s;ome weight. On Friday the 11th, I received a me&s;&s;age from the Prince, at Mr. Stanhope's, where I dined, to attend him next morning to Kew. I was not &s;orry for the opportunity, being re&s;olved to leave no ambiguity in his Royal Highne&s;s's mind about my behaviour, and very apprehen&s;ive that names going about, and mi&s;repre&s;ented as doubtful upon &s;o important a point, (how in&s;ignificant &s;o ever) might influence, or mi&s;lead unwary people. Before we ro&s;e from table, at Mr. Stanhope's, a &s;ervant brought me word that Sir P. Methuen had been at my hou&s;e, and left word that he was gone home. I went directly to wait on him. He was then ju&s;t come from the Prince, to whom he had repre&s;ented the danger and impracticability of this mea&s;ure, with all the force and weight that became &s;o hone&s;t and &s;o honourable a man; and u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible arguments, that a good head and a good heart could &s;ugge&s;t, to di&s;&s;uade him from it; but all without ef|fect: that he then declared to him, that he could not be for him; but, at the importunate and repeated re|que&s;t of his Royal Highne&s;s, and reflecting that he had not attended the Hou&s;e, &s;o as to give one &s;ingle vote, &s;ince the exci&s;e bill, he had been prevailed on to pro|mi&s;e his Royal Highne&s;s to be ab&s;ent, as he u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 12th, early in the morning, I re|ceived a me&s;&s;age $m the Prince, that he had put off his journey to K$w that day. However, being willing
<PB N="449" REF="459">
to come to an explanation, it was thought proper that I &s;hould place my&s;elf in the way, and go to his Royal Highne&s;s's apartment, to enquire after his, and her Royal Highne&s;s's health. The Pages told me that he was not come from the Prince&s;s's bed-chamber, but was pretty well, and had altered his re&s;olution of going to Kew. I went away on foot, and did not return home all the morning. Ju&s;t before three, one of the Prince's &s;ervants found me in the Park; told me he had been at my hou&s;e, but the &s;ervants knowing nothing of me, he had been all over the town after me, to let me know there was a mi&s;take in the morning me&s;&s;age, and that the Prince ordered me to dine with him, that day, at his hou&s;e in Pall Mall.</P>
<P>I dre&s;s'd, and got thither before his Royal Highne&s;s, but not before the company, which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of his bed-chamber. When he came, he de&s;ired the gen|tlemen to amu&s;e them&s;elves, and that he would take a walk with me till dinner. In the garden, after a little common conver&s;ation, he began by telling me that he had &s;een Sir Paul Methuen, and in&s;inuated that Sir P. &s;eemed well enough &s;atisfied with the propo&s;i|tion. I &s;aid I was infinitely &s;urpri&s;ed, and mortified that I &s;hould differ with him in opinion, in an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence, con&s;idering the long friend&s;hip between us, which implied &s;ome &s;imilitude of thinking. Upon which, he receded a little from that, and &s;eemed to give me leave to think that Sir P. did not much ap|prove of it, but however, had promi&s;ed to be ab&s;ent. Then he &s;aid he had talked to &s;everal people, and
<PB N="450" REF="460">
they, all, entered into it mo&s;t heartily. Having taken my own party, I did not think proper to enquire who they were, though I was very curious to know: being per&s;uaded, (and I am &s;o &s;till) that there could not be one unprejudiced man in the nation of competent age, weight, and experience, to advi&s;e a Prince, that would approve of &s;uch a mea&s;ure. After &s;ome pau&s;e, he told me he had &s;poken to Mr. Hedges (his Trea&s;urer) and Lord Baltimore (of his bed-chamber) who were zea|lou&s;ly for it. I &s;aid, no doubt his &s;ervants would vote for it; nobody could take it ill of them; they would have leave to do it. He an&s;wered, that 'twas no mat|ter who&s;e leave they had, &s;o he had their votes. He added, that he had &s;poken to Mr. Arthur Herbert, who not only engaged for him&s;elf, but would bring in all his friends. I &s;miled, and &s;aid, I did not apprehend that he could make any vote but his own. [His bro|ther was in France.] He &s;aid he would bet Mr. Her|bert could make above five. I replied, that, if it were &s;o, it mu&s;t be by making u&s;e of his Royal Highne&s;s's name. He &s;aid, that every body was for him: he was ab&s;olutely determined to bring it in: he would hear no advice upon it, and if there were but &s;even in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and three in the Hou&s;e of Lords for him, he would do it. I told him that, &s;ince he was ab&s;o|lutely determined, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to lay my humble opinion before him, when he would plea&s;e to receive it. He &s;aid, he did not want my opinion, his party was taken. I replied, that I did not pre&s;ume to offer my opinion as what was to guide his actions, but to lay before him what was to direct and govern my own; which I

&s;hould be glad to take the fir&s;t opportunity of doing, this not being a proper one, becau&s;e I &s;aw one of the gentlemen coming to acquaint his Royal Highne&s;s that dinner was &s;erved. He took no notice of that, but walked into the wood, and &s;aid that he would &s;hew me the Duke of Somer&s;et's letter; which he did. It con|tained a pretty long account of the precarious &s;tate of his Grace's health, which made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to come to town: referr'd to Lord Winchel&s;ea for his opinion of the communication he had received of his Royal Highne&s;s's intentions; and concluded by wi&s;hes that his Royal Highne&s;s may live many years, in health, pro&s;perity, and plenty: he made me take notice of the word plenty. I &s;aid that, with humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, this letter did not &s;eem to me to amount to a promi&s;e, nor give the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of his Grace's coming to town. He &s;aid it was no matter, he &s;hould have his proxy, which was the &s;ame thing, [as indeed he had.] He then, with a great deal of vehemence, fell upon the difficulties he lay under: that as he had &s;acrificed him|&s;elf to the nation, by demanding a marriage, (though the Prince&s;s was the be&s;t, and mo&s;t agreeable woman in the world) the nation ought to &s;tand by him: that if people would value their employments more than right and ju&s;tice, he could not help it; though he was &s;o &s;trong that he was &s;ure the Court dur&s;t not touch any one that voted for him. I got an opportunity of put|ting in a word here, and &s;aid, that I &s;aw, very well, little regard would be had to any profe&s;&s;ions of not be|ing bla&s;&s;ed by one's employment, though I thought my behaviour towards tho&s;e in power plainly &s;hewed
<PB N="452" REF="462">
(and to nobody more plainly than to him&s;elf) that I was not very &s;olicitous about mine: but I did, in my con&s;cience, think (and believe that every hone&s;t man, who&s;e circum&s;tances were above nece&s;&s;ity, would think) this matter to be far above any pecuniary con&s;idera|tions: that a breach, &s;o irreparable as this proceeding mu&s;t occa&s;ion, would, for the future, take off all the grace and lu&s;tre of any employment of either &s;ide: that no man of honour above nece&s;&s;ity, could &s;erve, for the future, with plea&s;ure, under the unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions that duty on the one &s;ide might be mi&s;con&s;trued into di&s;affection on the other: and therefore I humbly be|&s;ought him to believe that gentlemen, in this great ca&s;e, would lay a&s;ide tho&s;e le&s;&s;er con&s;iderations, and act upon &s;uperior and more affecting motives, their duty to the whole, which I thought evidently in danger. He re|plied, that it was to no purpo&s;e to talk about things &s;ettled, and re&s;olved among&s;t friends: that it was very hard he &s;hould be all his life in want, and the only one in the nation that was not to have ju&s;tice done him: that, now, was the time, and the only one, for people to do what they owed him; that he &s;hould expect it of them; he a&s;ked his right, and neither apprehended, nor fore&s;aw, any ill con&s;equences from it. I a&s;ked him, if he did not think it very dangerous to him to drive things to &s;uch an extremity between him, and his father, as might make it the intere&s;t of one half of the gentlemen of England, that he &s;hould never come upon the throne. He replied, why would they make them|&s;elves de&s;perate? Why would they not do what they owed him, and what was ju&s;tice? It would be their
<PB N="453" REF="463">
own faults: did he de&s;erve le&s;s than the Prince&s;s of Denmark? The gentlemen &s;tood by her. I endeavoured to &s;hew him the difference of the ca&s;e, in one e&s;&s;ential point, which I thought mo&s;t likely to &s;trike him, viz. In that ca&s;e the addition was propo&s;ed when the civil li&s;t was precarious, and not granted to King William for his life; and upon re-granting the duties which were, then, in the power of Parliament, that addition was demanded in her favour. But he gave no attention to it, but walked about with great precipitation, and a good deal agitated. As I &s;aw there was no room left to make any impre&s;&s;ion upon him, I thought it was high time to put an end to the conver&s;ation, and there|fore told him that &s;ince I found him unalterable in his re&s;olution, I would not pre&s;ume to offer any thing more in oppo&s;ition to it, but mu&s;t beg leave to give him my plain &s;entiments as to my&s;elf: that I would have been glad to have had liberty to con&s;ult my friends, becau&s;e it would have given my opinion more weight with my|&s;elf, but as that could not be, and as I believed no|thing they could &s;ay would alter it, I thought my&s;elf obliged to declare to him, and I did it with great con|cern, that if this matter came into Parliament, I &s;hould think my&s;elf obliged, in honour and con&s;cience, to give my ab&s;olute di&s;&s;ent to it, as pernicious and de&s;tructive to all the Royal Family, and to the nation in general. He &s;eemed very angry, but curb'd him&s;elf a little; and &s;aid he could never have expected this from me; but he &s;uppo&s;ed then, that he was to expect all my friends again&s;t him, [meaning tho&s;e gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons whom he thought I could

influence.] I told him that I &s;poke only for my&s;elf; that I had not dropped the lea&s;t hint to any one of them; they would know it but too &s;oon. This con|ver&s;ation brought us to the door; I &s;aw he was very much heated, and, going in, he &s;aid he mu&s;t do as he could; that in the Prince&s;s of Denmark's time there were gentlemen that valued doing right, more than their employments; he was &s;orry the race of them was extinct: I had only time to &s;ay, that I was to &s;ubmit to whatever his Royal-Highne&s;s plea&s;ed to think, or &s;ay, and content my&s;elf with doing what I thought my duty. Thus we went to dinner, with a great deal of anxiety on my part, from the real affection, as well as reverence, that I bear him; and with much more freedom, and gaiety on his, than I could po&s;&s;ibly put on.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as dinner and drinking was over, we ro&s;e, and I &s;huffled my&s;elf into the mid&s;t of the company, in order to get away with the fir&s;t of them, when he plea&s;ed to make us his bow; but he di&s;mi&s;s'd them all, and ordered me to come with him into the little room. This conver&s;ation was much the longe&s;t, la&s;ting near two hours; but as there was a great deal of repe|tition, I &s;hall only put down what has not been al|ready &s;aid; though &s;carce any thing was &s;aid by him, in the two former, that was not &s;trongly repeated, and in&s;i&s;ted upon, in this.</P>
<P>His Royal Highne&s;s began by telling me that he had done with a&s;king me any thing more for his &s;ake,
<PB N="455" REF="465">
but, as he had always had the greate&s;t kindne&s;s and af|fection for me, he would now talk to me a little, for my own.&mdash;That he de&s;ired me &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, in this affair, my own reputation in the world; that it would &s;uffer extremely by leaving him: that I mu&s;t be &s;en&s;i|ble, I had done my&s;elf a great deal of hurt in the opinion of mankind, already, by acquie&s;cing &s;o much as I had done, in mea&s;ures, with tho&s;e who had treated me, and all my friends &s;o ill; but that it would be a great ag|gravation to that prejudice, if I neglected &s;o advanta|geous an opportunity as this of getting free from it: and much more to this purpo&s;e. After humble thanks for his goodne&s;s, I replied that I was very &s;en&s;ible of the difficulties I lay under: that I had no choice to make but what mu&s;t be di&s;agreeable, and painful to me: that as to the Mini&s;try, I had very little regard to tho&s;e who treated me, or any of my friends &s;lightingly: that I thought nobody cared le&s;s who knew it, or took le&s;s pains to conceal it: that in an affair, where I was convinced the whole was concerned, I mu&s;t prefer my own integrity to the opinion of the world, and keep peace at home, whatever other people might think, or &s;ay. He &s;aid it was &s;trange, that his be&s;t friends, and tho&s;e he counted mo&s;t upon, &s;hould be again&s;t him: that he wondered I &s;hould con&s;ider my own character, and my intere&s;t &s;o little: he had always had the greate&s;t kindne&s;s for me, he was re&s;olved to &s;hew it in the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing manner; why would I make it impo&s;&s;ible? Why, when he &s;hould have it in his power, give occa&s;ion to have it thrown in his teeth, that he was going to di&s;tingui&s;h one who had left him at the
<PB N="456" REF="466">
only time that he could want his friend&s;hip? That I mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, after this, he could &s;ee me, no more, upon the foot he had done. I &s;aid, I was extremely &s;en&s;ible of the truth of all he had been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, and that I had no comfort on either &s;ide, but from the &s;en&s;e of doing my duty: that my rea&s;on informed me this was a mea&s;ure fatal to him&s;elf, and to the whole country; I was convinced of it; and my honour and con&s;cience obliged me to di&s;&s;ent from it. He a&s;ked me, &s;uppo&s;ing that were &s;o, if I never had given a vote again&s;t my opinion, in concurrence with tho&s;e I had no rea&s;on to like. I an&s;wered, I had, many; and believed it was the ca&s;e of every body who had acted with a party, either for, or again&s;t an Admini&s;tration: that, in my opi|nion, bu&s;ine&s;s was not to be carried on in an ab&s;tracted way, by con&s;idering every point &s;imply, and without connection to the whole: but that I had never acted contrary to my opinion, where I thought the whole immediately concerned, as I &s;tood convinced it was, in this; and therefore, no earthly con&s;ideration could make me be for it. He then pre&s;s'd me much with the authority of the people engaged: Would I talk with Mr. Pulteney and Lord Carteret? and if I was con|vinced it was their opinion, and they thought it right, would I then be for it? It could do no hurt to &s;ee them at lea&s;t. I replied, I could have no doubt that they were engaged in it, after what his Royal Highne&s;s had been plea&s;ed to &s;ay; and that Lord Carteret might be the more ea&s;ily induced to it from a per&s;ua&s;ion that it mu&s;t drop in the Hou&s;e of Commons. He &s;aid, that if there were but three votes for it, there, it &s;hould
<PB N="457" REF="467">
come into the Hou&s;e of Lords: did I think him &s;o &s;imple as not to know Carteret? Would I &s;ee them? I an&s;wered that I had the greate&s;t regard for Lord Car|teret's parts and abilities, and the mo&s;t &s;incere re&s;pect and value for Mr. Pulteney, with whom I had lived in an intimate acquaintance for &s;ome years, and whom I always reckoned one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men this country had bred: that if his Royal High|ne&s;s commanded me, I was very willing to wait on them, but in no ways upon the foot of altering my opi|nion, &s;ingly upon their authority, and becau&s;e the con|trary might be theirs: but, (I over&s;hot my&s;elf &s;o far as to add) to &s;hew his Royal Highne&s;s how much I was in con&s;cience per&s;uaded of the truth of my opinion, unequal as I was, (and in nobody's thoughts more &s;o, than in my own) I would venture to talk with both tho&s;e gentlemen, before his Royal Highne&s;s, upon the con&s;equences of this mea&s;ure, and if they could &s;hew me that the bringing it into Parliament would not be attended with the greate&s;t dangers, prejudice, and di|vi&s;ions, both in the Royal Family and the nation, be it right, or wrong in it&s;elf, when brought in, then I would be for it. His Royal Highne&s;s dropp'd this propo&s;ition (which I was extremely glad of, having given a very indi&s;creet opening again&s;t my&s;elf) and &s;aid it was his due; he hoped it was no fault to claim his due, and the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls told him that it was his right in equity. I &s;aid that equity among&s;t gentle|men, indeed, was under&s;tood to mean a plau&s;ible de|mand to a thing; but as the Ma&s;ter was a Judge in Equity, I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the expre&s;&s;ion from him,
<PB N="458" REF="468">
and could hardly believe that he would affirm to me, that there could be grounded a legal equity upon that &s;tatute; to take the allotment of the e&s;tate thereby ve&s;ted in the Crown, out of the King's di&s;po&s;ition. He &s;aid it was his right, he had one hundred and eighty en|gaged to &s;upport him, and he hoped he &s;hould ob|tain it.</P>
<P>Not &s;eeing the end of the conver&s;ation, I was re|&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to do what I thought my duty, and to &s;et before him the precipices he was going to plunge into, let the reception it met with be what it would; and accordingly, I took the liberty of &s;aying, that &s;ince it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould have 50,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> addition, I humbly beg'd leave to know of his Royal Highne&s;s, why he would not rather chu&s;e to a&s;k it of the Parliament, than to pu&s;h this dangerous and de&s;perate mea&s;ure? That I was highly &s;en&s;ible this propo&s;ition was very far from being prudent, or advi&s;eable in it&s;elf, but, bad as it was, yet it was &s;o infinitely preferable to the other evil, that I would not only be for it, but would &s;upport and maintain it with all my &s;trength; and would engage that all my friends, not only tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of Commons, but tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of Lords, would be for it. He &s;aid, no, he thought the nation had done enough, if not too much for the family, already: that he would rather beg his bread from door to door, than be a farther charge to them; and that he would have it in this way, or not at all. I replied, that &s;ince he expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much tenderne&s;s to the nation, I intreated him to
<PB N="459" REF="469">
con&s;ider the &s;tate to which he reduced it: to reflect on the profu&s;ion of blood, and trea&s;ure we had lavi&s;hed, to maintain our liberties and con&s;titution: to remem|ber at what a va&s;t expence we had brought over, and maintained his family, &s;olely, and &s;ingly, to &s;ecure to us, and protect us in the quiet enjoyment of tho&s;e liberties, and that con&s;titution; and then to think what &s;entiments it mu&s;t rai&s;e in every hone&s;t country gentleman of great property; who have warm wi&s;hes to all the Royal Family, and who expected no|thing but a good word, and a kind look from every part of it in return; to think a little, I &s;aid, what that body of men mu&s;t feel, to be dragg'd, un|avoidably, by that very Royal Family, into the fatal nece&s;&s;ity of being de&s;perate with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of, or the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Crown: that, for my part, I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed, if they all ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the Hou&s;e, with hearts full of di&s;content, and di&s;ta&s;te on both &s;ides. He &s;aid, that if they would not do their duty chearfully, they mu&s;t be frightened into it; or to that effect; he could not &s;uffer all his life, &amp;c. I a&s;ked him, if he thought they were to be frightened; and if they were, I appealed to his genero&s;ity, if that were a ju&s;t return: that I mo&s;t earne&s;tly &s;upplicated him not to overturn the con&s;titution, and the whole Royal Family together: that I had always been bred in monarchical principles, &s;uch as were con&s;i&s;tent with a free people: that I could no more help the people to intermeddle with the ju&s;t rights of the Crown, than tamely &s;it &s;till, and &s;ee the Crown invade, and de&s;troy
<PB N="460" REF="470">
the ju&s;t rights of the people. Did he, could he believe, that if the King were to propo&s;e to a council, for their opinion, whether he &s;hould give his Royal High|ne&s;s 50,000<HI>l.</HI> or 100,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI> that any of tho&s;e Lords he had named, or my&s;elf, &s;hould have a mo|ment's difficulty, in delivering, and &s;upporting our opinion for the larger &s;um? Surely he could not; there we &s;hould act according to our duty, and con&s;ti|tutionally; but to bring the Parliament into the King's clo&s;et, for them to examine into his mo&s;t pri|vate, dome&s;tick affairs, intrude them&s;elves into the government of his private e&s;tate and family, was, &s;urely, the mo&s;t fatal precedent that could be made, and the mo&s;t unheard of to be attempted by a Prince that was to &s;ucceed him: that I mo&s;t earne&s;tly conjured him to con&s;ider what he was doing: that we all hoped he would have children; that he knew he had a brother; if it &s;hould happen when he was on the throne, that di&s;contents &s;hould ari&s;e, (and there had been di&s;con|tents under the be&s;t Princes that ever reigned) how would he like to have a Parliament tell him, that the Duke was an amiable, and a popular Prince, of great merit and expectation, that they thought his appanage too &s;mall, and de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty to double it: that he was born in England, and the nation could not think them&s;elves &s;afe in keeping up &s;uch an army, unle&s;s the Duke was declared General? Would he like this? and yet this they might do, they would have a precedent for it, and what was more extraordinary, and unan|&s;werable, a precedent of his own making. He &s;aid he knew how to avoid that: he gave me his word he
<PB N="461" REF="471">
would make his children and his brother entirely ea&s;y, they &s;hould have mo&s;t ample allowances; that would be a mo&s;t effectual way to keep every body quiet. I a&s;ked him if he was &s;ure that they would be, all, and always rea&s;onable? Would all tho&s;e that advi&s;ed them, be &s;o? Could he be blind to what fatal foundations he was laying for future di&s;turbances? And beg'd him to con&s;ider, that even rebellions with a Prince of the Blood at the head of them, lo&s;t a great deal of the horror, and even of the danger of common rebellions. I de&s;ired, that he would talk to the Duke of Argyll, and Lord Scarborough, to &s;ee if I was &s;ingle in my apprehen&s;ions. He &s;aid, no, the Duke of Argyll was too deeply engaged with the Court, by his employments. I intreated him to look on the Duke in a far &s;uperior and more ju&s;t light, as one of the fir&s;t of his father's &s;ubjects, and more &s;o, by his firm, and unalterable at|tachment, and unavoidable connection to the whole Royal Family, than by his rank; but, however, Lord Scarborough had no employment. He &s;till &s;aid no; Scarborough, he knew, was always full of his fears, which he laughed at. I replied, that I was &s;ure, if Lord Scarborough had his fears, they were for his Royal Highne&s;s, and not for him&s;elf. He &s;till refu&s;ed to &s;peak to either of them, and &s;aid that, now he did not think to &s;peak to the Duke of Dor&s;et or Lord Wil|mington. I beg'd him to believe, that I only &s;poke my own &s;entiments, and not to alter his de&s;ign of &s;ending for them upon that. He &s;aid, no, it was to no purpo&s;e; he knew we were in the &s;ame way of thinking, and was &s;atisfied, he could expect nothing from thence,
<PB N="462" REF="472">
&s;o would not &s;end for them; nor would he, now, for Sir Thomas Frankland, or Sir Conyers Darcy, as he once de&s;igned. I &s;till per&s;i&s;ted to de&s;ire, that he would not include tho&s;e gentlemen with me, who knew no|thing of it; but he per&s;i&s;ted in the contrary, which made me &s;ay that I was extremely &s;orry that he would not &s;peak to gentlemen of that character; and that I did not believe he would find one di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate man, unheated by oppo&s;ition, of figure enough to be con&s;ulted, who would not, mo&s;t ardently, and vehemently advi&s;e his Royal Highne&s;s again&s;t this mea&s;ure. He then re|newed his in&s;tances &s;trongly to make me for it, and &s;aid he &s;hould make a very bad figure in the world, when it appeared that his be&s;t friends were again&s;t him, (and this he repeated often) in the only point he could want them, and in a point I well knew he was, always, entirely &s;et upon, and had always had in view. I replied, it was true, I did know he was always bent upon it, but his Royal Highne&s;s as well knew, that I always, as con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed this way of attempting it: that he well knew that my firmne&s;s on this head, was the fir&s;t, and chief cau&s;e of his withdrawing, for the&s;e two years la&s;t pa&s;t, the confidence he formerly honoured me with: that I &s;poke it, without the lea&s;t thought of complaint, but he knew it was &s;o; and therefore, as I could, by no means, charge his Royal Highne&s;s with acting incon&s;i&s;tently in pur&s;uing this view; he mu&s;t al&s;o do me the ju&s;tice to own, that I acted con&s;i&s;tently with my&s;elf in di&s;&s;enting from it: that as he had been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed often to u&s;e the word friends leaving one, friends not a&s;&s;i&s;ting one, &amp;c. I mo&s;t humbly
<PB N="463" REF="473">
beg'd leave to &s;ubmit, if it was friendly to take a re&s;o|lution of the highe&s;t nature, a re&s;olution one was known to be again&s;t, and unalterably to fix that re&s;olu|tion, with I could not &s;ay who; not with the friends, certainly, of tho&s;e he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to call friends; and all this, without the lea&s;t communication to them, till it was irrecoverable; without giving them the lea&s;t opportunity of having their objections weighed, or their &s;cruples removed; but only to tell them that the thing was fixed, and they mu&s;t follow, or refu&s;e it. He then &s;et forth how unpopular the Court had made it&s;elf through the nation, which was much the rever&s;e, on his &s;ide. I told him, that I reflected, with much concern, on any unpopularity, but was thoroughly per&s;uaded that this mea&s;ure would le&s;&s;en the unpopularity where he &s;eemed to expre&s;s the greate&s;t di&s;like; and lay a foundation for it, where he thought, and I was per&s;uaded there was none; be|cau&s;e I was convinced that an attack upon his Royal Father, of this nature, and at this time, would produce &s;o incurable a divi&s;ion, that when mens' fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ided, and they began to reflect coolly, the authors, and advi&s;ers of this mea&s;ure, (I did not know them, but the world would certainly fix it &s;omewhere, un|ju&s;tly perhaps) would, in the end, become the dete&s;ta|tion of mankind, and perhaps of po&s;terity. He &s;till continued to pre&s;s m$ warmly, and &s;aid that my being again&s;t him $ut off his fingers; but &s;ure I could not deny him to be $word$, if I would not be for him. I told him, that as I now &s;tood informed, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for me to be ab&s;ent; when I had taken a ma|ture
<PB N="464" REF="474">
re&s;olution upon a thing of this weight, I thought it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with my honour, and reputa|tion, not to dare to &s;hew it: that, however, if I could find any means to &s;atisfy my honour to my&s;elf in being ab&s;ent, I would wait on his Royal Highne&s;s again, but as I, now, was informed, I thought it impo&s;&s;ible: and that nothing could happen to me &s;o fatal, not even his Royal Highne&s;s's di&s;plea&s;ure, as to leave the lea&s;t ambiguity upon his mind, of my conduct. He a&s;ked what I meant by ambiguity. I &s;aid, to leave any doubt with his Royal Highne&s;s, or rea&s;on for him to &s;uppo&s;e, that I would be for him, or ab&s;ent, when he would afterwards hear that I was again&s;t him. He &s;aid it was very &s;trange, that I would not be ab&s;ent, when I had &s;aid, that I thought it natural that many gentlemen of great honour, and property would refu&s;e to vote in this que&s;tion. I replied, that I could not be ab&s;ent, becau&s;e I did not come under the latter part of the de&s;cription I had made of them, for I had &s;aid, that what would make &s;uch gentlemen be ab&s;ent, would be a motive of di&s;&s;atisfaction again&s;t both, for having driven them to that extremity: now that could never be a motive with me, to what&s;oever extremities I might be reduced. He &s;aid, he &s;aw then that he was to expect me, and all my friends (meaning the Commoners) again&s;t him. I told him, that as to my friends, I had not dropp'd the lea&s;t hint to them of this affair: that I hoped, for his &s;ake, they would not &s;ee it in the light that I did; and did promi&s;e him, that I would u&s;e no one argument to induce them to do &s;o: but for my&s;elf, it was with great concern I was obliged
<PB N="465" REF="475">
to &s;ay, that I mu&s;t be again&s;t it, unle&s;s I could find rea&s;ons, which I did not, then, &s;ee, and which I be|lieved it impo&s;&s;ible to find, to be ab&s;ent; if I did, I would certainly wait on his Royal Highne&s;s again, and let him know it: thus ended the mo&s;t painful con|ver&s;ation I ever had, or, believe, I ever &s;hall have, whil&s;t I live.</P>
<P>As what is put down here, is only to aid my own memory, while the tran&s;action is fre&s;h, and in parti|culars, only, where I was immediately concerned, I will not &s;ay when the Mini&s;try fir&s;t knew of this re&s;o|lution: though, I think, I have undeniable rea&s;ons to believe, they did not know it till Sunday the 13th, at &s;oone&s;t, more probably not till Monday the 14th, which is extremely &s;urpri&s;ing. On Wedne&s;day the 16th it was publick, and I was &s;topp'd by &s;everal gentlemen in the Hou&s;e of Commons, who de&s;ired my opinion, which I gave to none. Sir Robert Walpole de&s;ired me to &s;tay the ri&s;ing of the Hou&s;e, that he might &s;peak with me: I did &s;o, and when the Hou&s;e was almo&s;t empty, we went behind the chair together. He was, then, &s;o little informed of people's opinions, that he began by &s;aying, that he de&s;ired to &s;peak to me without re&s;erve, and therefore would a&s;k me, frankly, if upon this great que&s;tion, I would give him a meeting: I an|&s;wered, that this great que&s;tion was not new to me: that for three years preceding the two la&s;t, it had been the great &s;truggle of my life to prevent it from break|ing out then: that I would not have done &s;o, if I had not entirely di&s;approved it; and that, from that time,
<PB N="466" REF="476">
up to this very hour, I had never &s;een any one rea&s;on to induce me to alter my opinion. He &s;aid it was a very hand&s;ome declaration, and he thanked me; but that I well knew many things were liable to be im|puted to us, which we were not guilty of, and there|fore beg'd me to &s;peak to my friends. I &s;aid that I de&s;ired there might be no mi&s;takes between us upon a &s;ubject of this importance; that I &s;poke for my&s;elf plainly, and openly, I always di&s;approved of this mea&s;ure as pernicious, and fatal to the whole Royal Family, and as &s;uch, would give my publick di&s;&s;ent to it. As to what he called my friends, I &s;uppo&s;ed he meant Mr. Dodington; Mr. Wyndham, Mr. Beaghan, and the two Me&s;&s;rs. Tucker. He &s;aid, yes. I replied, that as to this matter, I would tell him the whole truth, in|different how far he credited it: that it would be idle to tell him that I did not know of this mea&s;ure, for I did, long &s;ince, but under &s;uch re&s;trictions that hin|dered me from communicating it to any body; that I regarded tho&s;e ties, and had not even hinted it to any one of tho&s;e gentlemen; but as the thing was, now, publick, I had already &s;poke to &s;ome of them, and did de&s;ign to do &s;o to the re&s;t, to meet me, that night; but, as yet, could give him no manner of gue&s;s, as to their opinion in this matter. He again de&s;ired me not to do the thing by halves, becau&s;e it would be im|puted. I told him that they were independent gentle|men; that though their fortunes were not large, yet they were &s;ufficient, and they were re&s;olved they always &s;hould be &s;ufficient to keep them in independency; that he be&s;t knew they had not been regarded, or treated
<PB N="467" REF="477">
in a manner to give them any great pre&s;ent expectations. He interrupted me here, and &s;aid we under&s;tood one another; that what I &s;aid with relation to tho&s;e gen|tlemen was true, and had proceeded from not being in a &s;ituation to have it otherwi&s;e, [meaning the coldne&s;s between us.] I replied, that I did under&s;tand him, but as he knew they had no pre&s;ent expectations, I could by no means &s;ay how far they would care to for|feit the pro&s;pect of all future favours, and advantages. He pre&s;s'd me again to &s;peak to them, for, indeed, it would be imputed. His repeating that &s;o often, heated me a little, and made me tell him, that I very little regarded what might be imputed to me, unju&s;tly: had I any preten&s;ions? any expectations? What had I a&s;ked, or pretended? He knew I had none; if I had, let him &s;ay it. He &s;aid it was very true: that I mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that there had been great mi&s;under&s;tandings between us, he was willing to &s;uppo&s;e on both &s;ides, but that &s;o great a &s;ervice as this, wiped out a multi|tude of things. I an&s;wered, that what I &s;hould do was from a motive of my duty, that I neither a&s;ked, nor expected any reward for it, nor pretended any thing from it: that as to the gentlemen, I would, as I de|&s;igned, lay the matter fairly before them, and plainly tell them which way I &s;hould vote: whether my exam|ple would influence them, they mu&s;t determine, but I &s;hould u&s;e no arguments to do it.</P>
<P>I did &s;o the &s;ame night: and they, from their own judgments, entirely unbla&s;&s;ed, or attempted to be &s;o, by me, all determined to vote for the King.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="478">On Sunday the 20th, about twelve gentlemen met at Sir Robert Walpole's, to be informed (as the cu&s;tom is of all tho&s;e meetings) of what is re&s;olved upon; in|&s;tead of being con&s;ulted (as the cu&s;tom ought to be) upon what &s;hould be re&s;olved on.</P>
<P>When the company was gone, I told Sir Robert Walpole that I had laid the matter before the gentle|men, and that I found they were di&s;po&s;ed to act in the &s;ame manner, that I had declared I would do. He thanked me, and was going on (as I thought) to mention future expectations; but I prevented him, by continuing to &s;ay, that if I had been &s;o unfortunate as to take another part in this unlucky affair, than that which the real &s;en&s;e of my duty, and zeal for the whole Royal Family had determined me to take, I believed he mu&s;t be very &s;en&s;ible that the connection between tho&s;e gentlemen and me was &s;uch, that we &s;hould not have differed in opinion. He &s;aid there could be no manner of doubt of it. I added that I, then, left him to con&s;ider whether, be&s;ide that real &s;en&s;e of my duty, I had had, from the day this King came upon the throne, up to that hour, any one inducement to do what I had re&s;olved to do. He an&s;wered, to be &s;ure not; the mi&s;under&s;tandings between him and me, were very publick, but now&mdash;and was going on, but I thought it not proper to enter into explanations, and interrupted him by &s;aying, I did not mention this in any the lea&s;t way of complaint, but thought I owed my&s;elf &s;o much ju&s;tice as to put him in mind of it: that as I acted from a principle of honour, and con|&s;cience
<PB N="469" REF="479">
only, I was very regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences that might happen to me from it; though I was not &s;o blind as not to &s;ee that I &s;tood expo&s;ed to future re|&s;entments by it, at lea&s;t as much as any gentleman in England; with which I took my leave. On Tue&s;day the 22d, the motion was made by Mr. Pulteney and &s;econded by Sir John Barnard: the me&s;&s;age and an&s;wer produced by Sir Robert Walpole. The Hou&s;e divided between twelve and one: the numbers for the King were 234, for the Prince 204. There were 45 Tories ab&s;ent; 35 members voted for the Prince again&s;t us, who, I think, never voted again&s;t us before.</P>
<P>On Friday the 25th, the &s;ame motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Lords, (where I was al&s;o) by Lord Carteret, and &s;econded by Lord Gower: the debate la&s;ted till pa&s;t eight, when the motion was rejected. The num|bers for the King were; for the Prince.</P>
<P>Thus ended this unhappy affair in Parliament: God, only, knows where the con&s;equences of it will end in a nation, where, by the profligacy, and di&s;&s;o|lutene&s;s of their manners, the people &s;eem to have for|feited all pretence to the divine favour, and interpo&s;ition; and where ba&s;ene&s;s, degeneracy, and corruption is ar|rived to &s;uch a height, as to make them an ea&s;y prey, not only to the glaring qualities, and mi&s;called virtue$ of great, ill de&s;igning Princes; but even to the mo&s;t barefaced, de&s;picable attempts of the weake&s;t, when|ever they &s;hall think fit to employ a little low cunning, and open corruption to en&s;lave them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I mu&s;t own I am under but little, per|haps too little con&s;traint, when I conver&s;e with your Royal Highne&s;s, in the familiarity of private life, which your conde&s;cen&s;ion, often, calls me to. Yet, when I approach you in the light of a great Prince, of admirable endowments, by nature; highly improved by art and ob&s;ervation; a Prince with one foot on the throne of a, once, great, and powerful people; called thither by Providence, to prevent, or compleat its ruin: when I approach you in this light, and, above all, when I con&s;ider, that I am called to offer my &s;erious opinion, relating to a conduct that mu&s;t determine this awful event; I confe&s;s I am too much agitated,
<PB N="474" REF="483">
between the re&s;olution of doing my duty to my country, and the fear of offending by too full, and plain a di&s;|charge of it, to &s;peak to your Royal Highne&s;s with that calmne&s;s of mind, that full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my&s;elf, which the greatne&s;s of the object, the operation, and the actor require, upon &s;o &s;olemn an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have, therefore, cho&s;en this way of memorial, as a means to lay my thoughts before your Royal Highne&s;s, in a le&s;s confu&s;ed manner, and, at the &s;ame time, to give you an opportunity of examining them, as your lei&s;ure and inclination &s;hall dictate: humbly hoping, only, that you will give them a full, and calm con&s;i|deration, as the &s;ettled opinion, after much reflection, of a man bound by duty, and impelled by gratitude and inclination, to prefer your true glory and intere&s;t, and the welfare of this country, (which are in&s;eparable) to all other, earthly, con&s;iderations; and one, who looks upon the faithful di&s;charge of this great duty, as the mo&s;t important article he is an&s;werable for, to Almighty God, before whom he expects, &s;hortly, to appear.</P>
<P>As nobody has &s;een this paper; elegance, and accu|curacy, it may, po&s;&s;ibly, want: &s;incerity, and affection, it, certainly, will not: the head may err; the heart cannot.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin, Sir, with parliamentary affairs, &s;o far forth, only, as they relate to the part your Royal High|ne&s;s, in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, ought to take in them,
<PB N="475" REF="484">
by tho&s;e who are more immediately honoured with your character, and protection.</P>
<P>I chu&s;e to begin with this head, becau&s;e it is mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing in point of time; becau&s;e it is what you are, mo&s;t deeply, engaged in; and becau&s;e (though per|haps unavoidably, at fir&s;t) it is, now, become the &s;ource, and cau&s;e, of all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable diffi|culties you labour under; and which, each in its turn, may be the &s;ubject of different memorials, if you &s;hall plea&s;e to approve of this method of laying my thoughts before your Royal Highne&s;s.</P>
<P>The narrow mea&s;ure of governing by a party, which has, unfortunately, attended the frequency of Parlia|ments, (a thing, in it&s;elf, mo&s;t de&s;irable) &s;eems to have been the occa&s;ion, that oppo&s;ition has, too fre|quently, changed its views, from the redre&s;s of grie|vances, (its ancient, and only ju&s;tifiable object) to a pur&s;uit of private preferment, or private re&s;entment. Let us take them &s;eparately, and &s;ee, if a Prince of Wales can appear at the head of either, con&s;i&s;tent with his true greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, let us con&s;ider an oppo&s;ition carried on for the private preferment of the oppo&s;ers.&mdash;Can a Prince of Wales be preferr'd?&mdash;He mu&s;t be King; and as he can be nothing el&s;e, can &s;uch an oppo&s;ition make him &s;o, one hour before his time? or if it could, would he not reject it, with horror and indignation?</P>
<P><PB N="476" REF="485">Let us, next, form to our&s;elves, an oppo&s;ition founded upon re&s;entment; a re&s;olution to pull down, po&s;&s;ibly to puni&s;h, tho&s;e that have offended us, without con&s;idering con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Will a Prince of Wales appear to act publickly, from re&s;entment, and pa&s;&s;ion only? and that too, un|der the di&s;advantage of appearing to do it, peevi&s;hly, per&s;onally, ineffectually, when he mu&s;t, one day, have it in his power to do it, nobly, nationally, and effectually?</P>
<P>Having &s;hewn that the ends, to which oppo&s;itions have been, u&s;ually, directed, are incon&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t, and true glory of a Prince of Wales, in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation; let us examine, if the methods of oppo&s;ition, employed to attain tho&s;e ends, are better calculated for your Royal Highne&s;s's great purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, then, that I have &s;tated, which is that of an oppo&s;ition founded on &s;elf intere&s;t, only: the methods, in &s;hort, are, a &s;teady, and unvariable attention to propo&s;e every thing that is &s;pecious, but impracticable, or un&s;ea&s;onable: to depreciate, and le&s;|&s;en every thing that is blamele&s;s, and to exaggerate and inflame every thing that is blameable; in order to make the people de&s;ire, and the Crown con&s;ent, to the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e in power, and place, to make room for the leaders, and followers of the oppo&s;ition. But a Prince of your elevation, Sir, cannot act as the head of any Admini&s;tration; 'tis de&s;cending too low: nor can your followers act under any, without cea&s;ing to
<PB N="477" REF="486">
be &s;o. I humbly think, it is not your intere&s;t to drive them from you; and I am &s;ure, it is not theirs, to quit the certain favour of a King, whom they will have contributed to make a great King, for the uncer|tain, ill-will'd, precarious emoluments, which they may &s;natch, in the &s;cramble of a new Admini&s;tration, forced upon the Crown.</P>
<P>The methods of carrying on the &s;econd &s;ort of op|po&s;ition I have mentioned, in which, re&s;entment is the chief motive and ingredient, admit of a very &s;hort di&s;cu&s;&s;ion: they are much the &s;ame, with the other, only heightened, and inflamed. Propo&s;ing things, not only un&s;ea&s;onable, but dangerous, and &s;ubver&s;ive of government it&s;elf: oppo&s;ing right, and wrong, with equal vehemence: and endeavouring to overturn the whole &s;y&s;tem, rather than not reach tho&s;e, who have the &s;upreme direction of it. I pre&s;ume, you, Sir, who are, by Providence, called to govern, will not contri|bute to make all government impracticable, or &s;acrifice to re&s;entment and pa&s;&s;ion, the welfare and pro&s;perity of the people, in which, your own intere&s;t and glory, is in&s;eparably implicated, and involved: nor will tho&s;e who hope to govern under you, find their account, in &s;uch a method of oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed, Sir, to let us make a little &s;tand, here, to &s;ee what we have proved; and to con&s;ider, what con&s;equences, nece&s;&s;arily, follow from the things proved, that ought to influence your pre&s;ent, and future conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="487">It is proved, I hope beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that the oppo&s;itions we have &s;een carried on, in this country, hitherto, are neither becoming your Royal Highne&s;s, in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, nor advantageous to your followers: that &s;uch an oppo&s;ition never can, either by its means, or its ends, e&s;tabli&s;h that point, which, alone, ought to influence the publick actions of a Prince: of a Prince like you, Sir, who want only to be &s;een, as you really are, not as you are mi&s;repre|&s;ented, (to which mi&s;repre&s;entations, the oppo&s;ition has, unavoidably, furni&s;hed &s;ome foundation, and pre|text) to become the &s;ole object of mankind's expecta|tion, for the redre&s;s of all the grievances they feel, and the di&s;pen&s;ation of all the future benefits they hope for.</P>
<P>Admitting, then, all this to be proved, what follows from it? Are we to infer, that the oppo&s;ition, which your Royal Highne&s;s countenanced and protected, was improperly, and injudiciou&s;ly entered into, and con&s;equently, that there ought to be no oppo&s;ition at all? Are one, or both of the&s;e points, the doc|trine you would e&s;tabli&s;h?&mdash;Neither the one, nor the other.</P>
<P>I am ready to own, that con&s;idering the humiliating &s;ituation prepared for your Royal Highne&s;s, at your fir&s;t coming to Britain, perhaps you had no means of procuring your&s;elf a proper independency, but by having recour&s;e to the unprincely weapon of oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="488">I will, al&s;o, willingly, admit, that &s;uch an indepen|dence was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h the dignity, and great|ne&s;s of your repre&s;entation, and to &s;hew you, in the proper light of a mediator between the King and the people: one, from whom they are to hope, and ex|pect every benefit they wanted, either by your inter|ce&s;&s;ion with, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to &s;overeign power.</P>
<P>But as the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions are true, and ju&s;tify your conduct towards the attainment of that nece&s;&s;ary inde|pendence, your Royal Highne&s;s mu&s;t, on the other &s;ide, own, that your being obliged to pur&s;ue it, by tho&s;e means, has forced you to &s;ubmit to many things, painful to you, in the execution: improper audiencies and applications, conde&s;cen&s;ions and familiarities, that, I humbly apprehend, you feared, and felt, mu&s;t le&s;&s;en that greatne&s;s, and publick &s;ignificance, which, by the independence then &s;truggled for, you were la|bouring to advance, and e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>Your Royal Highne&s;s mu&s;t al&s;o allow, that, as this pur&s;uit carried in its face the full likene&s;s of a private, pecuniary e&s;tabli&s;hment; the bulk of mankind, not being taught to &s;ee it as the foundation of that inde|pendence nece&s;&s;ary to make you their advocate, or their defender, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be aggrieved; the bulk of mankind, I &s;ay, not being taught to &s;ee, or rather being taught not to &s;ee it, in that light, judged of it in gro&s;s, and, as it carried private intere&s;t in the face, concluded, (&s;ince you went into Court upon gaining your point) that the &s;ame private intere&s;t was inter|woven
<PB N="480" REF="489">
with the whole, and compo&s;ed the con&s;tituent, and e&s;&s;ential parts of your intention, and de&s;ign.</P>
<P>So that the unavoidable con&s;equences of this method of oppo&s;ition, became a drawback upon it&s;elf, and, in &s;ome degree, defeated its own &s;ucce&s;s. For, though the nece&s;&s;ary independency was e&s;tabli&s;hed, there was, &s;till, &s;omething wanting, to &s;tamp, and impre&s;s upon the minds of the people, that exalted opinion, that &s;ervent, affectionate confidence and expectation, which the benevolence of your heart, and the force and ex|tent of your natural genius (much embelli&s;hed and improved) exact from all tho&s;e, who have the happi|ne&s;s to &s;ee your Royal Highne&s;s, in a near, and natural light: to find, and to fix this &s;omething, &s;o as it may produce to my country, the full ble&s;&s;ings of your mo&s;t gracious intentions, and beneficent re&s;olutions, is, un|der Heaven, the whole object of all my care, pains, ambition, and reward.&mdash;Nor do I de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>For I cannot believe, now the end is attained, that your Royal Highne&s;s will continue upon your&s;elf tho&s;e inconveniences, which it might be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit to, in order to attain it; we, indeed, your &s;ervants, by going on in the &s;ame eager method, and throwing your great name, and augu&s;t patronage be|fore us, might gratify our re&s;entments, and po&s;&s;ibly, our intere&s;ts, by forcing our&s;elves into place under the Mini&s;try: I &s;ay po&s;&s;ibly might, but I verily believe, that there is not one of us, that harbours &s;o mean a thought; and if any one differs in opinion with me,
<PB N="481" REF="490">
upon the&s;e great points, I humbly hope your Royal Highne&s;s will be per&s;uaded, (as I am from the convic|tion of my con&s;cience) that it proceeds from a different conception of things, only, but from a heart as affec+tionate, and zealous as my own, for your Royal High|ne&s;s's true intere&s;t, and glory. But I, &s;till, return to this point, that I do not imagine, that a Prince of your prudence and di&s;cernment, will continue a pur&s;uit, that cannot, in all human probability, be attended with &s;ucce&s;s: and if it was, could be employed to no de&s;irable end, that falls within the compa&s;s of my poor comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The pur&s;uit I mean, is a majority in Parliament, which I hold, morally, impo&s;&s;ible to gain; and if it could be gained, I am entirely at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s, what advantageous u&s;e to your Royal Highne&s;s, could be made of it; on the contrary, I think it the thing, of all others, the lea&s;t to be wi&s;hed. For, if we were a &s;ufficient majority to drive out the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, your Royal Highne&s;s would not, I pre&s;ume, have us take their places; that were to drive us from you, in|deed; for, in the pre&s;ent unhappy di&s;po&s;ition of the Royal Family, you well know, that to keep the places, into which we had intruded, we mu&s;t act like our pre|dece&s;&s;ors, very di&s;honourably, and di&s;gracefully to our&s;elves, indeed, but certainly, very offen&s;ively to your Royal Highne&s;s. Be&s;ides, if we were that ma|jority, with all the $moluments, and temptations fall within reach, and in our power, is your Royal High|ne&s;s
<PB N="482" REF="491">
very &s;ure you could &s;top us, all, &s;hort, and hinder us from ru&s;hing in, to the plunder?</P>
<P>This great &s;omething, then, that is wanting, this nece&s;&s;ary point of light, which is not to be found in the pre&s;ent methods, or ends of oppo&s;ition, mu&s;t be fixed and a&s;certained, in order to proportion, and adapt the means, to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Now, according to my under&s;tanding, this great, and nece&s;&s;ary point is, to fix in the minds of $$$kind, by the dignity, and &s;teadine&s;s of your own behaviour, a &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your warm, and beneficent intentions for the welfare of this country, without private view, or re&s;entment: and by &s;uch a choice of tho&s;e, to whom you delegate the principal direction of your affairs, as may create a full confidence, that you are, not only thoroughly determined, but al&s;o, pro|perly prepared, to carry tho&s;e intentions into full execution, when you are ve&s;ted with power to do it.</P>
<P>And, now, Sir, I, whom your Royal Highne&s;s may, hitherto, have thought an enemy to all oppo&s;ition, be|come an humble advocate, in my turn, for an oppo&s;i|tion; &s;uch an one, as may be productive of this noble purpo&s;e, &s;uitable to the greatne&s;s of your name, your reputation, and mo&s;t princely accompli&s;hments: an oppo&s;ition &s;trongly marked with the publick good, where your private views, all, plainly, center in the publick welfare; and tho&s;e of your followers, are
<PB N="483" REF="492">
openly, and declaredly, confined to the honour of, one day, carrying your great de&s;igns into execution; till that time, to a&s;k for nothing, to accept of nothing, but devote them&s;elves to watch over the public, and prevent, as far as they can, any farther encroachments being made upon it, till, by becoming the glorious in&s;truments of your gracious intentions, they can redre&s;s all the grievances, they have not been able to prevent.</P>
<P>The noble &s;implicity of this oppo&s;ition, &s;upported with &s;uitable gravity, &s;teadine&s;s, and dignity, without doors, will awake, and fix the attention of mankind on your Royal Highne&s;s, as their proper object of defence, and ex|pectation. And even tho&s;e per&s;onal points, which, though mo&s;t ju&s;tly grounded, and ably &s;upported, would, now, be attempted ineffectually, as the movements of re&s;ent|ment, only, and end in a &s;anction, in&s;tead of a cen&s;ure: the pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e very points, will, when your power to puni&s;h, as well as reward, is equal to your will, be called for, by the people, as national ju&s;tice, and publick &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>To the &s;tandard of an oppo&s;ition thus &s;trongly marked, and characterized with the publick good, and the publick good, only; thus cleared from every cloud, and &s;tain of private intere&s;t, and re&s;entment; the hone&s;t, the brave, and the impartial, will gather, by degrees, and no &s;low ones, to increa&s;e the dignity, as w$ll as numbers, of your Royal Highne&s;s's party. But while they &s;ee, or think they &s;ee, the lea&s;t appearance

<P>All which, is humbly &s;ubmitted to your Royal High|ne&s;s's &s;uperior di&s;cernment, and direction.</P>

<HEAD>This narrative of Mr. Ralph appears to be a ju&s;|tification of Mr. Dodington, from a malicious report that he had intruded him&s;elf upon the late Prince of Wales, and had forced him&s;elf into the &s;ervice of his Royal Highne&s;s. It was written in the year <HI>1751,</HI> and is occa&s;ionally hinted at in the Diary.</HEAD>
<P>IT plea&s;ed his late Royal Highne&s;s the Prince of Wales, &s;ometimes to di&s;cour&s;e of political matters with Mr. Ralph.</P>
<P>On all &s;uch occa&s;ions, the Earl of Middle&s;ex was pre&s;ent; and &s;ometimes Dr. Sharpe.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;cour&s;es were generally pretty long; and $ &s;eldom happened, but that his Royal Highne&s;s men|tioned
<PB N="485" REF="494">
Mr. Dodington's name before they were brought to an end: &s;ometimes with complaints that he, Mr. Dodington, had left his Royal Highne&s;s, but oftener with expre&s;&s;ions of &s;elf-per&s;ua&s;ion, that he &s;hould re|cover him again one day or another.&mdash;Adding the&s;e, or &s;uch words as the&s;e&mdash;"we have good &s;ubalterns enough; but we want leaders."</P>
<P>Mr. Ralph, all this while, either kept on the re&s;erve, or threw in &s;uch general &s;ugge&s;tions concerning Mr. Dodington, as were rather dictated by &s;entiment than policy.</P>
<P>Once, and but once, when the conver&s;ation grew very particular, he did mo&s;t humbly offer him&s;elf to communicate his Royal Highne&s;s's commands to Mr. Dodington, in ca&s;e he had any to communicate, and &s;hould think fit to do him (Mr. Ralph) that honour. But his Royal Highne&s;s waved the motion at that time, by &s;aying, Lord Baltimore had been &s;poken to on that head; and, therefore, when he had any thing to &s;ay, his Lord&s;hip would be the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to &s;ay it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which, at &s;ome di&s;tance of time, his Royal Highne&s;s re&s;umed the topick one evening; and, at parting, clapping his hand on Mr. Ralph's arm, dropped certain expre&s;&s;ions, which, to the be&s;t of Mr. Ralph's remembrance, were the&s;e&mdash;Dear Ralph, or, good Ralph, get me Dodington, if po&s;&s;ible&mdash;I mu&s;t have Dodington at any rate.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="495">Mr. Ralph was rather perplexed, than plea&s;ed, with this commi&s;&s;ion: and Dr. Sharpe coming to him at Turnham Green, (he believes to know his (Mr. Ralph's) opinion concerning it) Mr. Ralph told him he could not proceed upon it, as it was too general; and, con&s;equently, tended more to draw him into a difficulty, with Mr. Dodington, than to an&s;wer his Royal Highne&s;s's purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>What followed was an order for him to come to town immediately; which, on his arrival, was fol|lowed by another, requiring him, expre&s;sly, in the name of his Royal Highne&s;s, to invite Mr. Dodington into his Royal Highne&s;s's &s;ervice; or rather, as it was phra&s;ed, to live with him, as he had formerly done, and as if that &s;ort of life had never been interrupted: which in|vitation was unaccompanied with any offer or &s;tipula|tion of any kind what&s;oever. Nay; when Mr. Ralph a&s;ked&mdash;if no character or employment, either in pre&s;ent or future, was allotted to him; the an&s;wer given, was, that nothing of either kind had been &s;o much as men|tioned.</P>
<P>This invitation Mr. Ralph carried to Mr. Doding|ton, who took two or three days to con&s;ider of it; and, having, in that interval, re&s;igned his employment, did, by Mr. Ralph, &s;end a letter, to be delivered into the hands of Lord Middle&s;ex, (who was the per&s;on em|ployed by his Royal Highne&s;s in this tran&s;action) the contents of which Mr. Dodington is be&s;t able to explain.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="496">About four months pa&s;&s;ed over, after this, without producing any farther explanation of either &s;ide; during which interval (though Mr. Ralph did wonder much, that his Royal Highne&s;s &s;hould be &s;o earne&s;t to have a gentleman at his devotion, whom he did not &s;eem to have any commands for, and might, po&s;&s;ibly, take the liberty to expre&s;s that wonder to his friends at times) he never once pre&s;umed to importune his Royal High|ne&s;s, or to de&s;ire, that he might be importuned on Mr. Dodington's account.</P>
<P>La&s;tly; when his Royal Highne&s;s did, of his <HI>own</HI> mere motion, as Mr. Ralph apprehends, take Mr. Dodington into his actual &s;ervice, he, Mr. Dodington, did require Mr. Ralph, by and through my Lord Mid|dle&s;ex, to repeat the humble reque&s;t, which he had be|fore made to him in per&s;on; viz. that he might have the honour to &s;erve him without &s;alary, till it plea&s;ed God, that his Royal Highne&s;s &s;hould accede to the Throne. Mr. Ralph did, accordingly, communicate this reque&s;t to my Lord Middle&s;ex, to be communicated to his Royal Highne&s;s, which his Royal Highne&s;s re|fu&s;ed to admit: notwith&s;tanding which, Mr. Doding|ton did again renew the &s;ame &s;olicitation, and per&s;i&s;t in it, through the &s;ame channel; till Mr. Ralph was, at la&s;t, told by my Lord Middle&s;ex, that his Royal Highne&s;s was &s;o firm to his purpo&s;e, on that head, that he did not think it advi&s;eable to pre&s;s him any farther.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I UNDERSTAND, by Mr. Fox, and by a letter from your Grace to Lord Hallifax, that the King is di&s;po&s;ed to accept my &s;ervices: and I am very ready to &s;erve him, if I can do it, with utility to his Maje&s;ty and with honour to my&s;elf: for I do not want the &s;er|vice, either to mend my fortune, or for an introduction into the world; I want it for neither. I am come, therefore my Lord, to know of your Grace, in what, and in what &s;hape and &s;ituation his Maje&s;ty expects my &s;ervices.</P>
<P>He &s;aid it was true: and that the King had received what he laid before his Maje&s;ty of my zeal for his fa|mily, and of my abilities, much more favourably of late, than when he formerly had done all that he could with his Maje&s;ty, to&mdash;</P>
<P>My Lord, I beg we may not look back: that, I am &s;ure, will not advance any thing I came hither about.</P>
<P><PB N="489" REF="498">He &s;aid it was very obliging in me, to forget what was pa&s;s'd&mdash;but he mu&s;t have his own thoughts about it.</P>
<P>And I, mine, my Lord.</P>
<P>He proceeded to &s;ay, that as Mr. Fox was a per&s;on agreeable to me, the King had directed that Mr. Fox &s;hould come to Dor&s;et&s;hire to me, to &s;ettle matters, and that his Maje&s;ty would con&s;ent to any thing for my&s;elf, that I liked and &s;hould be agreed among&s;t us; not then knowing that I &s;hould be &s;o &s;oon at Hammer&s;mith.</P>
<P>I &s;aid I had &s;een Mr. Fox, and that he had &s;poke to me, in generals only, about publick affairs, and his Maje&s;ty's favourable di&s;po&s;ition to me.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he under&s;tood it &s;o: and that Mr. Fox had, only, reported that I was well di&s;po&s;ed to enter into the &s;ervice, and if mea&s;ures could be made agreeable, I had no objection to men.&mdash;And that, if there was any thing I liked, and would let it be known, it might be &s;haped out to my &s;atisfaction, &amp;c.</P>
<P>My Lord, where there is no offer, no an&s;wer can be expected.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, all would depend upon mea&s;ures, if tho&s;e could be made agreeable, every thing would be made ea&s;y; and therefore it would be proper to go upon that.</P>
<P>My Lord, if your Grace plea&s;es, one thing at once.
<PB N="490" REF="499">
As you have no offer to make, you can expect no an|&s;wer upon that head: and be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve that <HI>I</HI> have nothing to offer, and nothing to a&s;k.</P>
<P>Why, to be &s;ure, he &s;aid, if what was thought of was not agreeable, any thing el&s;e that I liked, migh$ be brought about: but what the King fir&s;t thought of, was the Comptroller's Staff.</P>
<P>My Lord, I will &s;uppo&s;e I did not hear you, and as <HI>you</HI> have nothing to offer, and <HI>I</HI> have nothing to a&s;k, there can be no an&s;wer, and we may &s;hut the book.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, that, if they had known I &s;hould not have liked the Staff, it would not have been thought of.</P>
<P>My Lord, it &s;hould not have been thought of.&mdash;If you plea&s;e, my Lord, let us &s;uppo&s;e that nothing &s;peci|fical has been offered: and I repeat my expectation that your Grace will remember, that I have nothing to offer, or propo&s;e to you, and nothing to a&s;k.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he under&s;tood it &s;o: and that I came, at his Maje&s;ty's requi&s;ition, who was de&s;irous I &s;hould come into the &s;ervice. And as for mea&s;ures, they had no particular ones, but the two treaties with He&s;&s;e, and Ru&s;&s;ia, which la&s;t, had been negociating, the&s;e two years (what he meant by that, I neither know, nor thought proper to a&s;k) and he &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. Fox had explained them.</P>
<P><PB N="491" REF="500">Upon my an&s;wering in the negative, and &s;aying that I did not believe that Mr. Fox under&s;tood them, tho|roughly, him&s;elf; his Grace began to enter into that with Ru&s;&s;ia; but I &s;topp'd him, by &s;aying that, I &s;up|po&s;ed they were two &s;ub&s;idiary treaties, which, like all others, bargained for a certain number of men, for a certain time: &s;o much &s;ub&s;idy to the Princes and &s;uch pay to the troops, when called for.</P>
<P>Yes&mdash;exactly &s;o&mdash;and then proceeded to &s;hew that the Ru&s;&s;ian treaty was the be&s;t, and only way to defend Hanover, and prevent a Continent war. That if Ha|nover was attacked for the &s;ake of England, it ought to be looked upon as England, &amp;c. and then would have gone on into the particulars, but I interrupted him, by &s;aying, then I would not lo&s;e your Grace's time, in explanation, which can only affect the mode of the thing, and not the &s;ub&s;tance; I may po&s;&s;ibly, think of it, as of a di&s;h dre&s;&s;ed by your Grace's cook, the more palatable, the more unwhole&s;ome. But I will be plain with your Grace; I think this Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ub&s;idy to be ruinous to this country, of mo&s;t dangerous precedent, mo&s;t hurtful to his Maje&s;ty's true intere&s;t, and de&s;tructive of the intere&s;t of his family: at the &s;ame time, in&s;ufficient to the ends propo&s;ed by it, and in&s;tead of preventing a Continental war, the mo&s;t certain &s;eed, and foundation of it. And I can never think I am &s;erving his Maje&s;ty by &s;upporting it.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I will agree with your Grace, and am willing it &s;hould be under&s;tood, I am for defending
<PB N="492" REF="501">
Hanover, if it be attacked out of re&s;entment to England, and that I not only never will con&s;ent to, but will hinder, to the be&s;t of my poor little power, the &s;words being &s;heathed, till Hanover be indemnified. I will go farther, and will allow without farther examination, that if it be, now, attacked, it is on the account of England:&mdash;but I do not think this Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ub&s;idy is the way to defend it, or to make the people fond of it. Be&s;ides, my Lord, your Grace knows, and I know that (without this Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ub&s;idy) it will never be at|tacked. He &s;aid, he wi&s;hed he did, that if I could convince him of that, it would be the be&s;t news that had come to England a great while.</P>
<P>I do know it, my Lord, and I thought your Grace had: unle&s;s we are to &s;uppo&s;e that people will do the direct contrary to what they have promi&s;ed, and enga|ged to do.</P>
<P>But at the &s;ame time I &s;ay this, of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ub|&s;idy, your Grace will ob&s;erve that <HI>I do not &s;ay</HI> that I will be for the He&s;&s;ian: I de&s;ire not to be mi&s;under&s;tood, or mi&s;repre&s;ented. Oh no! he under&s;tood me very well, and would be &s;ure not to mi&s;repre&s;ent me any where.</P>
<P>My Lord, I will not be mi&s;repre&s;ented. I do not &s;ay that I will approve of the He&s;&s;ian &s;ub&s;idy, if there were no Ru&s;&s;ian, becau&s;e con&s;idered by it&s;elf, 'tis a &s;illy, unadvi&s;ed &s;tep, the be&s;t one can think of it, or call it, is a jobb; 'tis &s;o apparently of no &s;ignificancy,

<P>My Lord, I did not come here, to di&s;pute with your Grace: my opinion of the general tendency of the&s;e &s;ub&s;idies, both at home, and abroad, will admit of no variation; and it is fit that I &s;hould acquaint your Grace, that as to the Ru&s;&s;ian, I will oppo&s;e it, with all the little credit, and efficacy I have, both in the Hou&s;e, and out of it: but I will do it with all the decency that is con&s;i&s;tent with truth.

And I went on to &s;ay, that as to the He&s;&s;ians, I did not &s;ay that I would be for them: that point, however, might admit of &s;ome modifica|tion: but if they, both, came in, I would indubitably

know whether ever they told him one word of truth) he &s;hould find (if they did) that I oppo&s;ed it &s;olely from the unfitne&s;s of the thing, and not becau&s;e any body, there, thought fit to oppo&s;e it: that I &s;hould &s;hew it was from opinion, my own opinion only; and not from any body's el&s;e; or out of di&s;like to, or again&s;t any body, that I oppo&s;ed it.

<OPENER><DATELINE>Goodwood,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM much obliged to Mr. Wyndham for the com|munication he has allowed you to make to me of Mr. Dodington's Diary, which has afforded me great en|tertainment, for few readings in my opinion are more amu&s;ing than this &s;ort of original memoirs, which give the true&s;t picture of the times in which they were written.</P>
<P>As the excellence of &s;uch a work con&s;i&s;ts in its being perfectly original, the &s;malle&s;t alteration would in my opinion de&s;troy its merit; and therefore, although the
<PB N="498" REF="507">
part, where I am mentioned, contains by no means a true &s;tate of that bu&s;ine&s;s, yet I am far from wi&s;hing to have it &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or altered. All I de&s;ire is, that, when Mr. Wyndham thinks proper to publi&s;h Mr. Doding|ton's Diary, he will permit this letter containing the true &s;tate of facts to be in&s;erted as an explanatory note to that tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Soon after his Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion, Sir Harry Er&s;kine, who had been removed from the Army by the late King, was re&s;tored to it by his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty with the &s;ame rank he would have had, if he had continued in the &s;ervice; by this means he came in again over my head. This induced me to de&s;ire an audience, in which I re&s;pectfully repre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty that, as I had particularly attached my&s;elf to the Military, and had &s;ought &s;ervice upon all occa&s;ions, I was in hopes that no per&s;on would have been put over me. But finding from his Maje&s;ty's an&s;wer, that Sir Harry Er&s;kine's removal in the late reign was owing to his attachment to his Maje&s;ty when Prince of Wales, and that he had then made him a promi&s;e to re&s;tore him to his rank when he &s;hould come to the Crown, I mo&s;t chearfully &s;ubmitted, and beg'd of his Maje&s;ty to be|lieve, that nothing could be further from my wi&s;h, than that he &s;hould break his word on any account, and particularly on mine. His Maje&s;ty then a&s;ked me, how it happened that I had never thought of any other line than the Military? my an&s;wer was, that I had not cho&s;e to put my&s;elf under an obligation to the Duke of Newca&s;tle or even to my brother-in-law Mr. Fox,
<PB N="499" REF="508">
being unwilling to connect my&s;elf with any Mini&s;ter. His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to receive very graciou&s;ly all I had &s;aid.</P>
<P>Being pre&s;ent at the next leve&egrave; day, Lord Bute took me a&s;ide and told me the King was much plea&s;ed with my behaviour in the clo&s;et: that his Maje&s;ty had ob|&s;erved my &s;aying that I had never thought of any line but the Military, and had ordered him to <HI>&s;ound me</HI> (I perfectly well recollect the expre&s;&s;ion) whether I &s;hould have any inclination to a civil employment? Lord Bute added, that he thought the be&s;t way of <HI>&s;ounding</HI> was at once to tell me the whole. That the King thought of making me a Lord of his Bedchamber; that I might know it would not be proper for the King to make a formal offer, but that, if I was di&s;po&s;ed to have it, I might a&s;k it, and he could a&s;&s;ure me I &s;hould not be refu&s;ed. I thanked his Lord&s;hip, expre&s;&s;ed my gratitude to his Maje&s;ty, and de&s;ired twenty-four hours to con&s;ider of it. I then a&s;ked for it in form and was immediately appointed.</P>
<P>A few days after I had ki&s;&s;ed hands, news arrived of the battle of Clo&s;ter Campen in Germany, in which the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, who commanded there, had been wor&s;ted. Lord Shelburne (then Lord Fitzmaurice) had been pre&s;ent at this action as a vo|lunteer: Lord Downe commanded the 25th regiment and received the wounds of which he afterwards died: my brother, Lord George Lennox, commanded a bat|talion of Briti&s;h grenadiers; he had been in the hotte&s;t
<PB N="500" REF="509">
part of the action, and, although he had the good luck not to be hurt, his cloaths were &s;hot through in &s;everal places, and he had the peculiar &s;atisfaction of remaining to the very la&s;t with the Hereditary Prince in the wood, which was the &s;cene of action, and when all his people were either killed or driven off, he, with a captain Mac Lane, actually carried off in their arms the Hereditary Prince who had no hor&s;e or attendants, and who from the wound he had received in his leg, was unable to walk. Lord Fitzmaurice and Lord Downe were both junior Lieutenant Colonels to Lord George Lennox, but his Maje&s;ty was advi&s;ed to reward their &s;ervices in this action by giving them the rank of Colonel over his head.</P>
<P>I thought it my duty to repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty how great a mortification it mu&s;t be to my brother, after having much di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf during the whole war, to be not only neglected, but even to &s;ee his juniors rewarded by being put over his head for their &s;ervices in this battle, where his behaviour had been &s;o remar|kable.</P>
<P>My repre&s;entations however proved ineffectual; upon which I re&s;igned the Bedchamber, a fortnight after I had received it. I afterwards communicated to Lord Bute the &s;tep I had taken, but have not the &s;malle&s;t recollection of his Lord&s;hip's mentioning to me
<Q>&startq;My having talked offen&s;ively of the Scotch on the pro|motion of Sir Harry Er&s;kine and of him (Bute) in &endq;particular.</Q>
On the contrary his Lord&s;hip was very
<PB N="501" REF="510">
civil to me, and expre&s;&s;ed his regret that I had not fir&s;t communicated to him my intentions of re&s;igning, as po&s;&s;ibly he might have found means to &s;atisfy me about my brother, and have prevented my quitting the Bedchamber.</P>
<P>But the point I am mo&s;t anxious to clear up is Mr. Dodington's a&s;&s;ertion, that the account which Lord Hallifax &s;aid I had given "That the King &s;ent and offered me the Bedchamber"&mdash;<HI>is not true</HI>&mdash;the account I have given will &s;hew whether Lord Bute was not <HI>&s;ent</HI> to me; and whether the manner in which his Lord&s;hip expre&s;&s;ed the orders he had received to <HI>&s;ound me</HI> do not in the language of plain dealing amount to an <HI>offer of the Bed|chamber from the King</HI>. It is true that I did a&s;k it in form (I believe by letter to Lord Bute) but this was &s;ub&s;equent to, and in con&s;equence of his orders to <HI>&s;ound me</HI> and not at the audience I had on the bu&s;ine&s;s of Sir Harry Er&s;kine's affair, which was previous, for I do very po&s;itively declare that till Lord Bute menti|oned the Bedchamber to me in that conver&s;ation, as an idea of the King's, it had not entered into my thoughts, which were never turned to that &s;ort of employment.</P>
<P>The difference of whether I fir&s;t a&s;ked for, or was offered this place, is very immaterial except as to the charge Mr. Dodington brings again&s;t me of having &s;aid <HI>what is not true</HI>. For, altho' it was very flattering to me to be thought of by his Maje&s;ty to be about his per&s;on, I had not the &s;illy impertinence to be above a&s;king for that honour, if my turn of mind had led me
<PB N="502" REF="511">
that way, but I cannot feel indifferent as to a $act which I am &s;tated to have mi&s;repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Your &s;ending this letter to Mr. Wyndham with the extract of the memoirs which I return inclo&s;ed, will much oblige,</P>
