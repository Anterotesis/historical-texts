<HEAD>THE <HI>Scots</HI> Nation and Union VINDICATED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN pur&s;uing an Enemy, that has neither acted the Gentleman or the Chri&s;tian, methinks no Man ought to expect our keeping any Rules.</P>
<P>Some wild Bea&s;ts are reckon'd &s;porting Creatures, and mu&s;t be kill'd fairly; but others that are Ravenous and Cruel, are knock'd down any how, as we can find them.</P>
<P>I have an Adver&s;ary that claims a Place in the la&s;t Cla&s;s; a ravenous Fury, that flies at a whole Nation, in &s;pight of an encorporation of Circum&s;tances, and without the Ceremony of pretending to any Provocation.</P>
<P>If this wild Creature is kill'd, he dies <HI>Felo de &s;e;</HI> for <HI>Scotland</HI> being, by the Union, become a Part of our &s;elves, he that Stabbs <HI>Scotland,</HI> may legally be &s;aid to Wound him&s;elf; for a Man is equally a &s;elf-murtherer what Part of his Body &s;oever receives the Wound: And he that Shoots him&s;elf into the Belly, is as much <HI>Felo de &s;e,</HI> as he that Cuts his own Throat.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> cannot but take it ill to be &s;o us'd &s;ince the Marriage, when &s;he reflects upon the Vows made to her in the Courting.</P>
<P>I re&s;olve to make her amends, and &s;ilence all her Complaints again&s;t her Spou&s;e; for as a Son of <HI>England</HI> has Affronted her, &s;o a Son of <HI>England</HI> &s;hall do her Ju&s;tice,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
and the National Quarrel will be fairly Ballanc'd be|tween us.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion will be, What way to deal with this Man-Mon&s;ter, and with what Weapons we mu&s;t fight him? It is u&s;ually e&s;teem'd the mo&s;t Honourable way of fight|ing, to beat a Man, as they call it, at his own Weapons; that is, to take the &s;ame Arms which his Enemy is mo&s;t a Ma&s;ter of; but I mu&s;t be depriv'd of that Honour; it can't be practis'd here; for the Adver&s;ary begins with <HI>LYING,</HI> a Weapon, at which I acknowledge my &s;elf no match for him.</P>
<P>In the Art of Fortifications, plain Lines, well fac'd Ba&s;tions, &s;olid Works, on good Foundations, are e&s;teem'd the be&s;t Defence again&s;t the mo&s;t furious, roaring, and loude&s;t Battery. In like manner, Matter of Fact and plain Truth, is the &s;olid Fortification of an Argument again&s;t Fal&s;hood and Slander.</P>
<P>He that &s;ets out with a Lye in his Mouth, makes a Bar|gain with the World, That they &s;hould believe nothing he &s;ays, and gives earne&s;t for his own part of the Contract.</P>
<P>Our Author acts the true Bully in every Part of his Work; and does it &s;o to the Life, that no Man can take him for a Mimick; he &s;corns to lye in Je&s;t&punc; and laugh you out of the Re&s;entment; but takes as much Pains to let us know he lyes, as he did to tell it.</P>
<P>He begins his Book, with taxing the <HI>Whiggs</HI> with the Sin of Genero&s;ity, and the only Crime, of which this Age will &s;carce ri&s;e in judgment again&s;t their Predece&s;&s;ors, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of a publick Spirit. This, the <HI>Whiggs</HI> them&s;elves, when they &s;aw the Title Page of his Book, took for a Satyr, and began very candidly to acknowledge they had been too ju&s;tly charg'd with the contrary Extreme, even to a Pro|verb.</P>
<P>But when they come to find the Man in earne&s;t, they could not, in Charity, believe but he mu&s;t be Mad. If he &s;tands upon the Reputation of his Sences, and is loath
<PB N="5" REF="4">
to bear the Scandal upon his Under&s;tanding, it mu&s;t e'en be transferr'd to his Principles; for it mu&s;t be allow'd, that whatever he would have others believe, he doth not be|lieve him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To hear a <HI>Tory</HI> charge the <HI>Whiggs</HI> with Genero&s;ity and a publick Spirit! What mu&s;t this pa&s;s for? A Banter it cannot be, becau&s;e of the Pains he takes to have it be be|lieved; a &s;erious Charge it cannot be, becau&s;e of all the Vouchers to the contrary to be taken from the &s;ame Au|thors own Works.</P>
<P>The&s;e Circum&s;tances reduce it to the Nece&s;&s;ity of be|ing call'd by its own Name, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> without any Coverture, Concealment, or Di&s;gui&s;e what&s;oever, <HI>(viz.)</HI> a known premeditated <HI>LYE.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus oblig'd to call a Spade a Spade, contrary to the Rules of Decency, I mu&s;t make him amends by a Proof of the Fact, which I know no Way to do, but by &s;etting down his own Words, and letting him&s;elf &s;peak for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Page of his Book, we find this mo&s;t excel|lent Introduction, which, tho' I have no room to <HI>Para|graph him,</HI> I mu&s;t recite, and make &s;uch recommendation of its Contents to the Courteous Readers, (&s;o we Authors call our mo&s;t ill natur'd Criticks,) as the Ca&s;e requires.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I cannot without &s;ome Envy, and a ju&s;t Re&s;entment again&s;t the oppo&s;ite Conduct of others, reflect upon the Genero&s;ity and Tenderne&s;s wherewith the Heads and principal Members of a &s;truggling Faction, treat tho&s;e who will undertake to hold a Pen in their De|fence. And the Behaviour of the&s;e Patrons is yet more laudable, becau&s;e the Benefits they confer, are al|mo&s;t <HI>gratis;</HI> if any of their Labourers can &s;cratch out a Pamphlet, they de&s;ire no more; there is no Que&s;tion
<PB N="6" REF="5">
offer'd about the Wit, the Stile, the Argument, let the Pamphlet come out upon demand, and in a pro|per Juncture, you &s;hall be well and certainly paid, you &s;hall be paid before-hand, every one of the Party who is able to Read, and can &s;pare a Shilling, &s;hall be a Sub|&s;criber.</Q></P>
<P>But where now &s;ay you is the Fal&s;ity in this Para|graph&mdash;I'll do the Author the ju&s;tice to own that it is not in the fir&s;t Line, where he &s;ays, he is &s;upply'd with <HI>Envy and Re&s;entment.</HI> No Man will doubt him there, be&s;ides he has di&s;tingui&s;h'd his Manner; for he gives evidence to prove what he &s;ays in that Part, which he has not Thought worth his while to do in any Thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>But before I go on, I mu&s;t not fall into the &s;ame Crime that I condemn, for having &s;aid he has LYED, this mu&s;t be proved. 'Tis a cour&s;e Word at be&s;t, and the cour&s;er it is, the more need to make it out, which I do thus.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis fair to believe it fal&s;e, becau&s;e <HI>it is not</HI> prov'd <HI>affirmante Incumbat probatio,</HI> and our Author having af|firm'd and not prov'd it, thereby proves that he has &s;aid what he cannot prove.</P>
<P N="2">2. But in the next Place, it is believed <HI>he cannot</HI> prove it, and that is the harde&s;t Part upon him.</P>
<P>If he expects to be taken <HI>Verb. &s;acerd.</HI> he mu&s;t excu&s;e me, I alledge it is not fair, becau&s;e publick Faith of all kinds, and this among the re&s;t, does not go at the u&s;ual Price, the Stock is fallen &s;o low there are no Bidders.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, he does not give &s;uch large Credit to tho&s;e he deals with; and in return, if he comes to me to be taken upon his Word, my An&s;wer is, <HI>No tru&s;t by Retail.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, his Affirmation not having the force of an Oath, becau&s;e he is no <HI>Quaker,</HI> proves to
<PB N="7" REF="6">
me of no force at all without Evidence; becau&s;e I am an <HI>&V;nbeliever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He &s;ays the</HI> Whigs <HI>are Generous to their Authors,</HI> You &s;hall be well and certainly paid, you &s;hall be paid before-hand, every one of the Party who is able to Read, and can &s;pare a Shilling, &s;hall be a Sub&s;criber.</P>
<P>That this was not always &s;o, the &s;tarving Authors who have been undone in the Service of the <HI>Whigs,</HI> are invin|cible Evidences; &s;uch as <HI>Julian John&s;on, Lawr. Braddon, John Tutchin, Jer. White, Ditto, Ditto, Ditto, ad Infini|tum,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e who they complain left them for want of Bread; even to their modern Sufferers, now in Pri&s;on and Bani&s;hment, who I doubt cannot boa&s;t.</P>
<P>How long the Alteration has happened among the <HI>Whigs</HI> he has left for a Secret; for if the Pa&s;&s;age he Points at were true, as to the Cri&s;is, it no more helps him out, or &s;aves his Credit, than <HI>one Swallow makes a Summer.</HI></P>
<P>In brief, he has &s;hew'd him&s;elf the wor&s;t Engineer in the World, for as they in a Fire, blow up one Hou&s;e to &s;ave a Street, he has blown up the whole Street to &s;ave a Hou&s;e. His Satyr is upon the Sub&s;cription to the <HI>CRISIS,</HI> to expo&s;e the A&s;&s;i&s;tance to which, he charges all the <HI>Whigs</HI> with profe&s;&s;ing univer&s;ally &s;uch a generous Princi|ple, which it had been infinitely their Honour if it had been true, and is their only Misfortune that it is not.</P>
<P>Thus our Author enters the Stage in very good Com|pany, <HI>ENVY</HI> and Fal&s;hood, one in one Hand, and one in t other, and behind him <HI>RESENTMENT</HI> follows cloath'd with Slander again&s;t his Friends; the Production mu&s;t be Good that is born of &s;uch Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not concern this Tract with any Part of his An&s;wer to the <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e the Author of the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> and he, are able to carry on their own War without any Foreign Alliances; but our Author having been en|gag'd with an Enemy in the Field, has maliciou&s;ly turn'd his Hand, and fired &s;ide ways at the Lookers on. This
<PB N="8" REF="7">
they can't but take unkindly, becau&s;e having not declar'd them&s;elves Parties in the Quarrel, he has acted like an Enemy to Mankind in the Gro&s;s, and falling promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly upon Friend and Foe, &s;hew'd that he choo&s;es to do Evil for the &s;ake of doing Evil, which Theologi&s;ts &s;ay, is not to be charg'd upon Satan him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This brings us to his Twenty &s;econd Page, where he begins to talk of the Union; and where he fires his whole Platoon upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, but e&s;pecially upon the No|bility of that Nation, a Body as illu&s;trious for all tho&s;e Things which make Men truly Noble, as any the World ever produced.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon the Di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation or their Affairs, it is but Ju&s;tice to the Enemy, and much more to the Reader, to give the Matter of Charge in his own Words; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Author may have no Wrong, and every Reader be judge whether he has or no; and <HI>Secondly,</HI> That I may di&s;mi&s;s the Scandalous Creature, and Trouble the Reader no more with him.</P>
<P>The Words which have given &s;uch a ju&s;t Offence to the World, are compri&s;ed in the following Paragraphs taken from the Book entituled, <HI>The Publick Spirit of the Whigs,</HI> &amp;c. and which being ju&s;tly afraid, or a&s;ham'd of, he has thought fit to omit in the &s;ub&s;equent Edition of the &s;ame Libel, as follows.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;After Two and twenty Pages &s;pent in reciting <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 24.</NOTE>Acts of Parliament, <HI>he</HI> (meaning the <HI>Cri&s;is) de|&s;ires leave to repeat the Hi&s;tory and Progre&s;s of the &V;nion;</HI></Q> upon which, I have &s;ome few Things to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>This Work,</HI> he tells us, <HI>was un&s;ucce&s;sfully attempted by &s;everal of her Maje&s;ty's Predece&s;&s;ors;</HI> tho' I do not re|member it was ever Thought on by any except King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, and the late King <HI>William.</HI> I have read indeed, That &s;ome &s;mall Overtures were made by the former of the&s;e Princes towards an Union between the Two Kingdoms, but rejected with Indignation and Con|tempt
<PB N="9" REF="8">
by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And the Hi&s;torian tell us, That how degenerate and corrupt &s;oever the Court and Par|liament then were, they would not give Ear to &s;o infa|mous a Propo&s;al. I do not find that any of the &s;ucceed|ing Princes, before the Revolution ever re&s;umed the De&s;ign, becau&s;e it was a Project for which there could not po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;&s;igned the lea&s;t Rea&s;on or Nece&s;&s;ity: For I defy any Mortal to name one &s;ingle Advantage that <HI>England</HI> could ever expect from &s;uch an Union.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;But towards the End of the late King's Reign, upon Apprehen&s;ion of the Want of I&s;&s;ue from him or the Prince&s;s <HI>Anne,</HI> a Propo&s;ition for Uniting both Kingdoms was begun, becau&s;e <HI>Scotland</HI> had not &s;ettled their Crown upon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> but left them&s;elves at large, in Hopes to make their Advantage: And it was thought highly dangerous to leave that Part of the I&s;land inha|bited by a poor, fierce Northern People, at Liberty to put them&s;elves under a different King: However, the Oppo&s;ition to this Work was &s;o great, that it could not be overcome till &s;ome Time after Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty came to the Crown, when by the Weakne&s;s or Corrup|tion of a certain Mini&s;ter &s;ince dead, an Act of Parlia|ment was obtain'd for the <HI>Scots,</HI> which gave them leave to Arm them&s;elves, and &s;o the Union became nece&s;&s;ary, not for any actual Good it could po&s;&s;ibly do us, but to avoid a probable Evil; and at the &s;ame time, &s;ave an obnoxious Mini&s;ter's Head, who was &s;o Wi&s;e, as to take the fir&s;t Opportunity of procuring a general Pardon by Act of Parliament, becau&s;e he could not with &s;o much Decency or Safety de&s;ire a particular One for him&s;elf. The&s;e Facts are well enough known to the whole King|dom: And I remember, Di&s;cour&s;ing above Six Years ago with the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;on of the adver&s;e Party, and a great Promoter of the Union, he frankly own'd to me, That this Nece&s;&s;ity, brought upon us by
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the wrong Management of the E&mdash;of <HI>G</HI>&mdash;, was the only Cau&s;e of the Union.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Therefore&punc; I am ready to grant Two Points to the Author of the <HI>Cri&s;is:</HI> Fir&s;t, That the Union became Nece&s;&s;ary for the Cau&s;e above related, becau&s;e it preven|ted the I&s;land from being govern'd by Two Kings, which <HI>England</HI> would never have &s;uffer'd: and it might proba|bly have co&s;t us a War of a Year or Two to reduce the <HI>Scots. Secondly,</HI> That it would be Dangerous to break this Union, at lea&s;t in this Juncture, while there is a <HI>Pretender</HI> abroad, who might probably lay hold of &s;uch an Opportunity. And this made me wonder a little at the Spirit of Faction la&s;t Summer among &s;ome People, who having been the great Promoters of the Union, and &s;everal of them the principal Gainers by it, could yet pro|ceed &s;o far, as to propo&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that it &s;hould be Di&s;&s;olved; while, at the &s;ame Time, tho&s;e Peers who had ever oppo&s;ed it in the Beginning, were then for Pre&s;erving it, upon the Rea&s;on I have ju&s;t a&s;&s;igned, and which the Author of the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> hath like|wi&s;e taken Notice of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;But when he tells us, <HI>The</HI> Engli&s;hmen <HI>ought in Genero|&s;ity to be more particularly careful in pre&s;erving</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 25.</NOTE><HI>this &V;nion,</HI> he argues like him&s;elf. <HI>The late Kingdom of</HI> Scotland, (&s;aith he) <HI>had as nu|merous a Nobility as</HI> England, &amp;c. They had indeed; and to that we owe one of the great and nece&s;&s;ary Evils of the Union upon the Foot it now &s;tands. Their No|bility is indeed &s;o numerous, that the whole Revenues of their Country would be hardly able to maintain them according to the Dignity of their Titles; and what is infinitely wor&s;e, they are never likely to be Ex|tinct till the la&s;t Period of all Things, becau&s;e the greate&s;t Part of them De&s;cend to Heirs general. I imagine, a Per&s;on of Quality prevailed on to Marry a Woman much his Inferior, and without a Groat to her Fortune,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and her Friends arguing, &s;he was as good as her Hus|band, becau&s;e &s;he brought him as numerous a Family of Relations and Servants, as &s;he found in his Hou&s;e. <HI>Scot|land</HI> in the Taxes is oblig'd to contribute One Penny for every Forty Pence laid upon <HI>England;</HI> and the Repre&s;en|tatives they &s;end to Parliament are about a Thirteenth. Every other <HI>Scots</HI> Peer has all the Priviledges of an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> one, except that of Sitting in Parliament, and even Precedence before all of the &s;ame Title that &s;hall be cre|ated for the Time to come. The Pen&s;ions and Employ|ments po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Natives of that Country now among us, do amount to more than the whole Body of their Nobility ever &s;pent at Home; and all the Money they rai&s;e upon the Publick is hardly &s;ufficient to defray their Civil and Military Li&s;ts. I could Point out &s;ome with great Titles, who affected to appear very vigorous for Di&s;&s;olving the Union, though their whole Revenues before that Period would have ill maintained a <HI>Welch</HI> Ju&s;tice of the Peace; and have &s;ince gathered more Money than ever any <HI>Scotchmen,</HI> who had not travell'd, could form an Idea of.</Q></P>
<P>That mo&s;t of this is entirely left out in the Third Edition of his Book is true, whether from a Sence of the Wrong done the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, and the injury to Truth, or Sence of Danger and of Ju&s;tice from the Notice taken of his Book in the Hou&s;e of Peers, he knows be&s;t, and would do well to tell.</P>
<P>But does he think this is a Satisfaction to the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Nation? Does he think that having di&s;per&s;t a lybellous Slander, at which not the <HI>Scots</HI> alone, but every impartial <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> is ju&s;tly incens'd, they are to re&s;t &s;atisfy'd, that in the &s;ub&s;equent Edition of his Book he has left it out?</P>
<P>He has made them his Je&s;t already, and mu&s;t think they are in Je&s;t with him, if this Smoothing Iron can work out the Marks and Scars which his rude and in&s;o|lent
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Attack had made on the Character of a whole Nation.</P>
<P>Should this go down, it would be a wor&s;e Affront upon the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation than the fir&s;t; and having told them already they are In&s;olent and Beggarly, and follow'd it with a Throng of the like rough <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which he excels in, it would al&s;o be to tell them they are tame Fools, that know not how to re&s;ent &s;uch U&s;age, or cannot &s;ee when they are Mal-treated; neither of which will be found to be any Part of the <HI>Scots</HI> Character.</P>
<P>This Author is farther inexcu&s;able, either in his Folly, or his In&s;olence to his own Country and to the Govern|ment: For either he &s;aid this upon a Pre&s;umption that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation would joyn with, and agree to this Treat|ment of their newly united Friends the <HI>Scots,</HI> which was the wor&s;t In&s;olence of that Kind he could be guilty of; or el&s;e he mu&s;t depend upon it they would not re&s;ent it, tho' they did not approve of it; in both which, we thank him, he did his be&s;t to make the Quarrel National, but he has <HI>taken a Tartar,</HI> and his Pa&s;&s;ions having left his Sences in the <HI>Lurch,</HI> however he may e&s;cape with his Knavery, his be&s;t Friends will never excu&s;e his Folly.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not honour his Example; I &s;hall act no Envy; I wi&s;h him no Puni&s;hment, tho' if he E&s;capes, it is becau&s;e the Servants of Hell are generally truer to their Employer than tho&s;e who Work for a better Ma&s;ter; and that as the wor&s;t Actions are oftne&s;t conceal'd, and the be&s;t oft|ne&s;t betray'd, he owes his Safety to the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation mu&s;t not lye down under the Charge, becau&s;e it is Slanderous; nor the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> under the Charge of bearing it, becau&s;e that would be Scandalous. For our own Sakes we mu&s;t do Ju&s;tice to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that we may not be reproacht with Connivance at a Slander, and give Occa&s;ion to the <HI>Scots</HI> to &s;ay, that we do not act honourably with them; and for their Sakes, that they may make good the ancient Motto of their Country, <HI>Nemo me Impune Lace&s;$it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
If nothing el&s;e were the Con&s;equence of the Union, this mu&s;t be allow'd, that they are thereby di&s;arm'd from the Power of doing them&s;elves Right again&s;t us in a Parliamentary Manner, which &s;trongly implies that they are more particularly in the Protection of the Parliamen|tary Ju&s;tice which Remains; and that we ought to E&s;teem every Thing that Touches the Honour of <HI>Scotland</HI> Natio|nally, as equally affecting all <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, we &s;hould be Nicer in an Affront offer'd to the Na|tion and Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by how much the more frankly they have by the Union given them&s;elves as it were into our Hands.</P>
<P>The Union was the Act of both Nations: But with|out Offence to either, it may be &s;aid, it was more the act of one than the other: One Side &s;trove more for it than the other; more Oppo&s;ition was made to it on one Part than on the other, which was which, need not be Nam'd; but if that Side &s;hould Reproach the Union fir&s;t, who mo&s;t carne&s;tly &s;ought it before, it mu&s;t be con&s;e&s;s'd the Charge of Ingratitude cannot lye upon the other.</P>
<P><HI>Our &s;landerous Lybeller compares the Union to a Mar|riage, and invidiou&s;ly &s;tates the Compari&s;on,</HI> a Per&s;on of Quality <HI>(England)</HI> marrying a Woman much his inferior&punc; <HI>(Scotland)</HI> and her Friends arguing &s;he was as good as her Husband, becau&s;e &s;he had as many Relations and Servants as he.</P>
<P>Our Author, it &s;eems, knows little of the Laws of Matrimony; perhaps he is under Vows of Prie&s;ts Celibacy; and it &s;eems he knows as little of the Laws of Dignity, for if he looks into Heraldry he will find a &s;tated Rule as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>If a Man of a mean Fortune, and without any De&s;igna|tion, marries a Woman of Quality, by her Marriage &s;he lo&s;es her Dignity, and &s;hall Rank but in the Degree of her Husband <HI>vice Ver&s;a.</HI> A Woman of mean Condition marries a Per&s;on of the highe&s;t Quality, &s;he Ranks in
<PB N="14" REF="13">

Let our Author take this which way he plea|&s;es in the Affair of the Union, which he has call'd a Mar|riage, it will be again&s;t him, and he may thank him&s;elf for the Compari&s;on.</P>
<P>If <HI>Scotland</HI> was inferiour, <HI>England</HI> by the Encorpora|tion of the Union has made her more than equal, for an Encorporation is a Di&s;&s;olving both into one: And the <HI>Scots</HI> are become a part of our&s;elves, &s;o that in Fact there is not a <HI>Scot&s;man</HI> or an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> in the World, the Two Natures, nationally Speaking, being di&s;&s;olved into One, <HI>viz. Britain;</HI> and the Simily or Allu&s;ion of a Marriage is lame, and halts in the Ca&s;e very much; for in a Marriage the Woman is a Subject, an inferiour; Promi&s;es Obedience, and is call'd by the Name of her Husband: But here is an entire Di&s;&s;olution of the former Capacities and Cir|cum&s;tances, and both become &s;ubjected equally to a new Con&s;titution, and take up a new Name.</P>
<P>If either of the&s;e United Per&s;ons, or States, or Bodies, call them as you plea&s;e, practi&s;e the lea&s;t Superiority or Autho|rity over one another as <HI>England,</HI> or as <HI>Scotland,</HI> they invade the Contract, Tre&s;pa&s;s upon the other; are Injurious and Unju&s;t; not to in&s;i&s;t upon their being &s;o far <HI>Felo de &s;e,</HI> and making an Attempt upon that Con&s;titution which being whole and undivided is the Life of both.</P>
<P>But to humour our facetious, tho' &s;currilous Author, let us go on with him in the Whym of a Marriage, in which he makes <HI>England</HI> the Husband, and <HI>Scotland</HI> the Wife. Tho' it &s;eems here is no Head&s;hip as in Matri|mony, but it is the more like our Author &s;till, who&s;e in|con&s;i&s;tent Raillery, has indeed neither Head or Tail.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> being the Husband, has married a Wife, <HI>&s;ays this Author,</HI> much inferiour to him in Quality. <HI>Good!</HI> But who promoted the Match? Did the Wife Court him or draw him in? Was he heated with Liquor, and
<PB N="15" REF="14">
did it when he was Drunk? Or was he hookt in, cheated and &s;urpriz'd into it? Did &s;he mannage him cunningly, and employ Agents to wheedle him? Did &s;he obtain a ra&s;h Promi&s;e, which was performed purely upon Prin|ciples of Honour and the like? If this is the Ca&s;e in a real Marriage of a Man and a Woman, as often hap|pens, we &s;ay of &s;uch a Woman &s;he runs a great Ri&s;que, 'tis odds but &s;he may have the Hearing of it again, and be ill u&s;ed without any Room to complain: But if on the other Hand &s;he declin'd the Match, fled from him, &s;trug|gled vehemently with her Friends who per&s;uaded her to have him, and had the Words of Matrimony as it were cramm'd down her Throat, &s;he may indeed be blam'd if &s;he makes an ill Wife; but he can never be excus'd if he makes an ill Husband. What if her Portion were &s;mall? Nay, what if &s;he had not a Groat, it al|ters not the Ca&s;e at all, neither does it furni&s;h him with the lea&s;t Word to Reproach her with, he being the Ag|gre&s;&s;or in the Match.

<HI>Inferiour,</HI> for you know very well I am of as much more ancient a Family than your &s;elf; that I have as truly noble Blood in my Veins as you, or any of your Re|lations have: Nay, that I am more noble than you, for I am more nearly than you allied to to the Crown that Rules over you; and the Per&s;on of your Prince de&s;cends more immediately from my Family than from yours; my Titles al&s;o are as good as yours, and I could at all Times have been married; nay, and formerly have been married to Per&s;ons of equal Rank (if not Supe|riour) to your &s;elf; nay, and that now I am married to you, I advance my &s;elf nothing in Rank, for I take Place as well, and of as many now, by the Right of my own Titles, as I do by yours: And tho' my Relations are not &s;o rich as yours, they have as much Honour, and their Ance&s;tors have always maintain'd that Honour in former Times, without the Help of yours, and could have done &s;o &s;till; &s;o that I do not E&s;teem my &s;elf your Inferiour at all, except only that I have &s;ubmitted my &s;elf to be your Wife.</Q></P>
<P>If the married Woman can &s;ay all this, will not every Man &s;ay &s;he has wrong done her if &s;he is Mal-treated by her Husband?</P>
<P>To carry on the Matter, our Lybeller's Allu&s;ion of a Marriage, and bring the Husband off hand&s;omely from &s;o &s;candalous an Affair as u&s;ing his Wife inhumanely, i'll &s;uppo&s;e him An&s;wering her thus:</P>

<P>And thus Ends the Family civil: The Honour and Re|putation of the Wife is, and ought to be vindicated; the Sincerity and Ju&s;tice of the Husband is thoroughly cleared by his doing Ju&s;tice upon tho&s;e Servants of his that had thus abu&s;ed his Wife: But having endeavoured to find out the particular Per&s;ons, they deny'd the Fact, and refu&s;ing to accu&s;e one another, the good Man pub|li&s;h'd his Abhorrence of the Mal-treatment his Wife had receiv'd, and promis'd 300 Pieces of Money to any of them that would acquaint him who it was had thus treated his Wife.</P>
<P>This the Lady takes for &s;ufficient Satisfaction, and &s;o they exchanged the Ki&s;s of Peace; and the Tranquility of the Family was re&s;tor'd, as at the Beginning.</P>
<P>If this Allegory does not run upon all Four in our Ca&s;e, let it run on as many Legs as it can, we know on which Side it will Halt.</P>
<P>I apply it to no Body, let tho&s;e that fit the Coat wear it, 'tis Application makes the A&s;s..</P>
<P>This &s;erves, tho' Allegorically, to An&s;wer all that can be objected by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> again&s;t the Union with <HI>Scot|land,</HI> which, if our Lybeller will have it call'd a Mar|riage, has certainly the&s;e few unhappy Circum&s;tances in it, which, what ever el&s;e may be &s;aid, mu&s;t &s;ilence all Complaints on our Side.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>England</HI> &s;ought to <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Uniting, not <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England;</HI> that may be evinc't by many Evidences.</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>Scotland</HI> was not &s;o low, or &s;o poor, but if they had not Courted her, other Nations would.</P>
<P N="4">4. When ever ye think well to break the Union, it it is thought <HI>Scotland</HI> will not deny you.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the <HI>&V;nion</HI> was now broken, or to be broken, it is thought by many, <HI>England</HI> would lo&s;e more by it than <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

<P>From his Affront offer'd to the Nation of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he comes next to fall upon the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this in the mo&s;t unu&s;ual, unhand&s;ome, and unmannerly way that was ever practi&s;ed in the like Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> need no Character or Enco|mium; the Antiquity of their Families, their per&s;onal Gallantry, the merit of their Ance&s;tors, as well as the Honour of their Country, makes them known, and uni|ver&s;ally

e&s;teem'd thro' the whole World. No Men are more acceptable abroad in the World, none more e&s;teem'd, and none owe that E&s;teem more to their own Vertue and Merit than they do. In all Ages, and in all Nations, they have been recommended by their own per&s;onal Behavi|our to the greate&s;t Employments, and to the greate&s;t Favour both of Princes and Kingdoms, as Soldiers and Generals; all the World Courts them, are fond of them, and value them beyond other Nations.</P>
<P>Even this Fellow, who&s;e good will to Slander, no Man can have the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to Que&s;tion; and who having little to &s;ay of their Per&s;ons, vents his Rage again&s;t the Nation it &s;elf. The Contempt he treats them with in general, &s;hews, that he &s;trives to load them with what ever he thinks would render them &s;candalous and odious; but even in this Attempt he comes into <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Character of the Satyr of&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>Much Malice mingled with but little Wit.</L></Q>
<P>Nor could his Malice have betray'd him to more Folly than he has &s;hewn in this Part. Phy&s;itians a&s;cribe one part of Madne&s;s to a Rupture of the Gall, which, when it happens, they &s;ay, it is a kind of Madne&s;s that runs People up to the mo&s;t malicious Things, in the mo&s;t &s;imple and prepo&s;terous Kind imaginable.</P>
<P>Of this kind, the Author of this mad but fooli&s;h Lybel has acted; for de&s;igning to throw Scandal and Dirt upon the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he has &s;ingled out one to Reproach them with, which, at be&s;t, if it had been true, had been only a Misfortune, but was never call'd a Crime before, <HI>viz.</HI> Poverty: And yet we &s;hall &s;ee how far from Truth that &s;candalous A&s;per&s;ion is in it &s;elf, how ill grounded in the whole, and how little it ought to be nam'd in a Nation&punc; where there are to be found
<PB N="21" REF="20">
far more Examples of large Inheritances of Honours and Titles without E&s;tates, than in all <HI>Scotland;</HI> and never|thele&s;s was never retorted upon them as a criminal Po|verty, any more than it ought to be upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the like is not to be &s;ound.</P>
<P>The Poverty with which we in&s;ult the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility, de&s;erves therefore to be a little enquir'd into, and &s;hall be con&s;ider'd ab&s;tractedly and comparatively.</P>
<P>If Poverty is con&s;ider'd ab&s;tractedly, the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> are as far from being Poor, as the Nobility of any Nation under the Sun, having always had &s;ufficient E&s;tates to maintain the Honour and Dignity of their Families, &s;ufficient to &s;upport all the needful Expences of a liberal Education, Travail, Learning, and of a hand&s;ome Intro|duction into the World, &s;uitable to Men of the fir&s;t Rank.</P>
<P>If &s;ome Families have &s;unk by the Misfortunes of &s;ome one or other among them, who have been either le&s;s Pro|vident, or e&s;s Enterprizing, than their Fathers; Is not the like here in <HI>England?</HI> only with this Difference, that there are more Examples in <HI>Scotland</HI> of the Po&s;terity of &s;uch having rai&s;ed tho&s;e Families again by their Vertue and Bravery than there are here, or perhaps in any Nation in the World.</P>
<P>I forbear con&s;idering the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Scot|land</HI> comparatively, becau&s;e it may &s;eem to reflect upon, and give Offence to the Nobility with whom they are now United, and look as if we were making tho&s;e Compari&s;ons to the Di&s;advantage of <HI>England,</HI> which, 'tis declar'd, is not in the lea&s;t intended in this Book.</P>
<P>If the E&s;tates of the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility are &s;maller than tho&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> the Influence and Authority they have upon, and over the People in their own Country, is, without Compari&s;on, beyond what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility have, or pretend to in theirs. And this renders their Per&s;ons far more con&s;iderable, and their Dignity, Honour and In|tere&s;t greater than tho&s;e can be in any Nation, who have
<PB N="22" REF="21">
nothing to render their Figure great but Money and Titles. It might be enquir'd here how many Noble Per&s;ons, in &s;ome Part of the World, more than in <HI>Scotland,</HI> may be found, who have not E&s;tates to &s;upport their Dignities, and become entirely dependant, by that exigence of Circum|&s;tances, upon the Courts and Mini&s;ters of State; of this or that Party, on one Side as well as on the other.</P>
<P>It might be enquir'd and calculated, whether there were more of the&s;e in <HI>Scotland</HI> than in other Parts or no.</P>
<P>It might be enquir'd whether the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility were not always in better Credit; and whether they were more in Debt than the Nobility of other Nations, in proportion to their E&s;tates, tho' at the &s;ame Time they enjoy'd no Pro|tection of Law again&s;t ju&s;t Debts, either for their Per&s;ons or E&s;tates. And whether any Man would not more freely lend Money to a <HI>Scots</HI> Nobleman, than to any of the No|bility of other Countries?</P>
<P>It might be enquir'd whether there are not in other Parts Noblemen to be found le&s;s able to pay their Debts than in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and e&s;pecially le&s;s willing, among tho&s;e that are able; but many Rea&s;ons prevent my Entring up|on the&s;e Compari&s;ons at this Time, however to the Advan|tage of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>If then the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> appear &s;uperior in their Intere&s;t, and influence in their Country; have E&s;tates equally able to &s;upport their Dignity, and an Authority far &s;uperior to all others of equal Rank with them&s;elves, all the &s;candal of their Poverty falls to the Ground.</P>
<P>But it cannot be omitted, that the &s;uppo&s;ed Poverty of the <HI>Scot$</HI> Nobility, &s;o much of it as may be thought real, is too evidently chargeable al&s;o upon <HI>England,</HI> which, on the other Hand, is a good Rea&s;on why the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen might expect not to hear of it in that Country which is &s;o vi&s;ibly the Occa&s;ion of it: And this re&s;pects the removal of the Court from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> whether the No|bility and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> nece&s;&s;arily following, &s;pend
<PB N="23" REF="22">
the Revenues of their E&s;tates either in the u&s;ual Luxury of Courts, which in <HI>England</HI> is encreas'd to a very great Degree, and which has been the ruin of many good <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families, as well as <HI>Scots;</HI> or in following the Fortuues of their Royal Ma&s;ter&punc; who by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rebellion lo&s;t not his Crown only, but his Life; or in their fruitle&s;s Attendance in pur&s;uit of their Intere&s;ts and ju&s;t Reque&s;ts at the Court of the Princes of that Age.</P>
<P><HI>From all which, I believe, the In&s;ults of this Lybeller may be turn'd off from the</HI> Scots <HI>Nation effectually thus, That whereas he alledges &s;candalou&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly, that</HI> the Per&s;ions and Em|ployments po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Natives of that Country <HI>(Scotland)</HI> now among us, do amount to more than the whole Body of their Nobility ever &s;pent at Home.</P>
<P>On the other Hand I undertake to &s;ay, That the Money &s;pent by the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> (and being the produce of their own E&s;tates too) in the Services of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and in their fruitle&s;s Attendance upon, or Re&s;idence in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Courts, amounts to infinitely more than all that they or any of their Nation ever gain'd or receiv'd in Pen&s;ions or Employments from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, &s;ince the Two Crowns were United.</P>
<P>Hence it will follow, that it is &s;o far from being ju&s;t to &s;ay, that the <HI>Scots</HI> are Gainers by <HI>England,</HI> that, on the contrary, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have &s;o far been the Ruin of <HI>Scotland</HI> as to Wealth, Ready-Money, &amp;c. The Revenues and Ca&s;h of that Country having been always carried out of the Country, and the Nobility and Gentry &s;pend|ing their E&s;tates at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court.</P>
<P>Why el&s;e &s;hould all Nations round us encrea&s;e in Wealth and Commerce; their Lands and E&s;tates be improv'd, Rents and Re|venues rais'd, and the like, and <HI>Scotland</HI> only decline and lan|gui&s;h? this could never be, but by a continual Con&s;umption, like an inward Bleeding, that has de&s;troy'd the Vitals of <HI>Scotland,</HI> exhau&s;ted her Wealth, and brought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court to be the Center of all the Wealth and Ready-Money of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which &s;hould otherwi&s;e have circulated in a Home Con&s;umption to the Encouragement of Trade, and the enriching their own People.</P>
