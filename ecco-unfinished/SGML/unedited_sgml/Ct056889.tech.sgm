<HEAD>THE
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_BEFORE I enter upon the
Subject of Preparation for
&s;o terrible a Vi&s;itation, as
this of the Plague; 'tis
meet I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething
of the Rea&s;ons we have to be Ap|prehen&s;ive
of it in this Nation; if the
Rea&s;ons of our Fears are not good,
the Sea&s;onablene&s;s of the whole Work
will be call$d in Que&s;tion; and it may
be, look'd on, as an officious Prophe&s;y|ing
of Evil Tidings. To talk of Prepa|rations
for a Danger which we are not in
danger of; would be a needle&s;s Alarm|ing
the People, and is a Thing often times
attended with ill Con&s;equences to the
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
Publick, being injurious to Commerce,
to Credit, and to the Civil Peace.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, the Evil is yet at
a Di&s;tance, and the Danger may be &s;aid
to be remote; But as we (1.) find it
to be a terrible &s;preading Di&s;temper,
furious and raging beyond what was
ever known in this Country, &s;weeping
away Old and Young, till it has de&s;ola|ted
whole Towns, and even &s;ome popu|lous
Cities. (2.) That it &s;preads apace
this way, having already advanc'd it
&s;elf above 100 Miles in the&s;e Eight
Months pa&s;t; and that we have &s;ome rea|&s;on
to believe that it was come much
nearer than they allow'd us to know of,
on the&s;e Accounts, I think, it is
rea&s;onable, at lea&s;t to put our &s;elves
in a Po&s;ture, not to be &s;urpriz'd if
we &s;hould meet with the &s;ame here.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I am far from being &s;ingu|lar
in my Apprehen&s;ions; the Govern|ment
are evidently in the &s;ame Concern;
and therefore we have had &s;everal <HI>Pro|clamations,
<PB N="v" REF="5">
Orders</HI> of <HI>Council,</HI> and o|ther
Directions for Ships performing
Quarantine, and for Goods to be Open|ed
and Air'd which come from &s;u&s;|pected
Places; and one Act of Parlia|ment
has been pa&s;s'd to Enforce tho&s;e
Orders, upon the highe&s;t Penalties, nay,
even upon pain of Death: And &s;o
cautious was the Parliament in this
Point, that they put the Nation to the
Expence of 25000 l. <HI>Sterling,</HI> to Burn
two <HI>Turkey</HI> Ships which were but &s;u&s;|pected
to have Goods on Board, which
might contain an Infection, and which
might bring the Plague among us,
which 25000 l. has been paid to the
Merchants and Owners of the Ships
and Cargo, in Satisfaction of the Da|mages
done them.</P>
<P>Can any Man &s;ay that the Govern|ment
have not had Occa&s;ion for the&s;e
Mea&s;ures? Let &s;uch look to what has
been done in <HI>Holland,</HI> where they not
only Burn'd two Ships, but Hang'd
a Man for Attempting to &s;ave &s;ome
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
Goods out of the Wreck of one Ship
that was Ca&s;t away, and which &s;hould
otherwi&s;e have been Burnt, as coming
from Places Infected, or &s;uppo&s;ed to be
Infected with the Plague.</P>
<P>Now while we receive daily, &s;uch af|flicting
and melancholly Accounts from
Abroad of the &s;preading of the Plague,
and of its Approaches this Way; and
find not only private Per&s;ons, but even
the Government it&s;elf, and Neighbouring
Governments al&s;o, ju&s;tly alarm'd, Who
can be wholly unconcern'd about it? Cer|tain
it is, that if it proceeds much
farther, nothing but the di&s;tingui&s;hing
Goodne&s;s of God can be &s;aid to keep
it from reaching hither; the Intercour&s;e,
of Commerce, and the many nece&s;&s;ary
Occa&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing be|tween
the two Kingdoms, being &s;o
great and a full &s;top of that Intercour&s;e,
being &s;o many ways Impracticable, as
we &s;ee it is.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">
If the$ we are in Expectation, and
under ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of it, what
Appearance is there of our Preparations
for it? Never le&s;s, I think, was to
be &s;een in any Nation under Heaven;
whether we &s;peak of Preparations to a|void
and e&s;cape it, or of Preparations
to wait and expect it; whether we
&s;peak of Preparations for the Soul or
for the Body: And this alone has
been the Occa&s;ion of writing this Book.</P>
<P>We have indeed &s;ome Phy&s;icians
who have given their Opinions in the
Matter of our managing our &s;elves with
re&s;pect to Medicine, in Ca&s;e of the
Plague breaking out among us; and into
this purpo&s;e they treat a little (<HI>tho' very
&s;uperficially</HI>) of the Nature of the Di&s;|ea&s;e,
the be&s;t preventive Remedies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
But even in this Part, however, as
I &s;aid, &s;urperficial at be&s;t, yet they differ
with, contradict, and oppo&s;e one another,
and leave their Readers as uncertain
and di&s;&s;atisfy'd, as far to &s;eek, and at
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
a lo&s;s for their Conduct, as they were
before.</P>
<P>As to the other Part, and what we
&s;hould think of doing when we &s;et &s;uch
an awful Providence in a clear $ight
before us, with re&s;pect to our religious
Preparations, and for our me$ting and
&s;ubmitting our &s;elves $o all $word$ Di&s;|pen&s;ations
of Providence of $word$ kind
&s;oever, which doubtle&s;s, is the $word$ of
every Chri&s;tian; of this, indeed, I have
&s;een, I may &s;ay, nothing at all offer'd
in Publick; on the contrary, the whole
World is intent and bu&s;y on their or|dinary
Occa&s;ions; Men pur&s;ue the u&s;ual
Cour&s;e of the World, they pu&s;h their
Intere&s;t, $$eir Gain, or their Plea|&s;ures
and Gaity, with the &s;ame Gu&s;t,
or rathe$ more than ever: Nay, the
cry of the Nation's Follies, grows lowder
and lowder every Day; and &s;o far we
are from con&s;idering, that when God's
Judgments are abroad in the Earth,
<HI>the Inhabitants &s;hould learn Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s;</HI>
that we are rather learning
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
to be more &s;uperlatively wicked than ever;
witne&s;s the Increa&s;e of Plays and Play-Hou&s;es,
one being now Building, tho' &s;o
many already in u&s;e; witne&s;s the Publick
Trading and Stock-jobbing <HI>on the Sab|bath-day;</HI>
Witne&s;s the raging Avarice
of the Times, by which the civil Inte|re&s;t
of the Nation, is ruin'd and de|&s;troy'd.
Witne&s;s al&s;o our Feuds, Di|vi&s;ions
and Heats, as well in religi|ous
Differences, as tho&s;e that are Po|litical,
which are all carry'd up to
dreadful Extremes.</P>
<P>&V;pon the&s;e many Accounts, this Work
has been &s;et on Foot, which though in
the De&s;ign of it, 'tis Calculated for the
pre&s;ent particular Occa&s;ion of the Ter|rors
we are under about the Plague,
which I may very well call impending,
yet may be u&s;eful many ways, both to
us and to Po&s;terity, though we &s;hould
be &s;par'd from that Portion of this
Bitter Cup which I verily believe is
re&s;erv'd for us.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="10">
To make this Di&s;cour&s;e Familiar and
Agreeable to every Reader, I have en|deavour'd
to make it as Hi&s;torical as
I could, and have therefore interming|led
it with &s;ome Accounts of Fact,
where I could come at them, and &s;ome
by report, &s;uited to and Calculated for
the Moral, endeavouring by all po&s;&s;ible
and ju&s;t Methods to encourage the great
Work of Preparation, which is the
main end of this &V;ndertaking.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;es I have &s;tated here, are
&s;uited with the utmo&s;t Care to the Cir|cum&s;tances
pa&s;t, and more e&s;pecially as
they are rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;uit tho&s;e
to come; and as I very particularly re|member
the la&s;t Vi&s;itation of this Kind,
which afflicted this Nation in 1665,
and have had Occa&s;ion to Conver&s;e with
many other Per&s;ons who liv'd in this
City all the while: I have cho&s;en &s;ome
of their Ca&s;es as Precedents for our pre|&s;ent
In&s;tructions. I take leave &s;o far to
Per&s;onate the particular People in their
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
Hi&s;tories, as is needful to the Ca&s;e in
hand, without making u&s;e of their Names,
tho' in many Ca&s;es I cou'd have de&s;|cended
to the very Names and Particu|lars
of the Per&s;ons them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But 'tis the Example that is the
Thing aim'd at the Application to the
&s;ame Mea&s;ures is argued, from the Rea|&s;on
and Nature of the Thing, as well
as from the Succe&s;s, and I recommend the
Experiments &s;aid here to be made, no
farther than they appear rational and
ju&s;t, with whatever Succe&s;s they had
been practis'd. As to the religious Hi&s;to|ry
here mention'd; till I &s;ee &s;ome ju&s;t
Exception rais'd again&s;t the Pattern laid
before us in very Part of it, I cannot
&s;ugge&s;t there will lie any again&s;t the man|ner
of relating it, and for that rea&s;on
I make no Apology for that Part, but
proceed directly to the Work it&s;elf.</P>

<P>_PERHAPS my Method in the

the&s;e I divide into ($.) General, Publick

<PB N="2" REF="13">
keeping it out of the Country of City, or
Town we live in, and preventing $$ts
&s;preading and penetrating from one Place
to another: $he Mea&s;ures which are now
taking, being I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, very De|ficient;
and ($.) Particular Preparations,
&s;uch as relate to Per&s;ons and Families for
Pre&s;erving us from $nfection in our Hou&s;cs,
when it plea&s;es God that it &s;hall come into
the City, or Place wherein we live.</P>
<P><HI>General Pr$parations,</HI> &s;eem to be confin'd
to the Mea&s;ures which the Government or
M$gi&s;trates m$y take to pre&s;e$ve the People
from infection. The main $hing the Govern|ment
&s;eem to have their Eyes upon in this
Nation, is to Li$i$ and Prohib$t Com|mhrce
with Places In$ected, and re$$rain the
Importation of &s;uch Good, as are &s;ubject to
be Infe$$ed; $ere it is granted, that &s;ome
Goods are apt more than others to retain
the p$i$onous Eff$uvia which they may
have receiv'd in Foreign Parts, and by
Con&s;equence, are apt to emit tho&s;e Efflu|via
a again when they Arrive $ere and
come to be &s;pread: The&s;e Poi&s;enous or
Infectio$s Effluvia or Particles, as &s;ome call
them, take hold or &s;eize upon the People
who are handling them: I need not in|numerate
the particular &s;orts of Goods
which are thus e&s;teem'd &s;u&s;ceptible o$ in|fection:
Abundance has been &s;aid on that
<PB N="3" REF="14">
Subject by other Authors, and all our
Proclamations, Acts of Parliament, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which have been pa&s;s'd on this Subject,
have taken Notice of them.</P>
<P>It is true, that as I have hinted before,
our Government have &s;eem'd &s;ufficiently
Careful to &s;ettle &s;uch Limitations of Com|merce,
Prohibitions and Quarantin$s, as
have been n$ce&s;&s;$ry to be ob&s;erv'd by
Ships and Pa&s;&s;engers, coming in to his
Maje&s;ty's Dominions, with re&s;pect to the
Places Su&s;pected, as well as to &s;uch as are
known to be $ow Vi&s;ited; and al&s;o, to Ex|tend
tho&s;e Limitations and Re&s;trictions to
more Places and $orts as they $ave thought
fit, and as the Infection has been found
to adv$nce $earer and nea$er&punc; and $ad the
Injunctions thus la$d on our People, been
punctually and duly Ob$erv'd, po&s;&s;ibly
we might with &s;$me Ground have been
encourag$d to hope for Deliverance, or at
lea&s;t to have flatter'd our &s;elves with a
po&s;&s;ibility of Guarding our Principal
Places ain&s;t it.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not omit that we are not
a Nation qualify'd &s;o well to re&s;i&s;t the
Progre&s;s of &s;uch a Di&s;temper, or the En|trance
of it into our Country, as others
are; we have a Set of M$n among us, &s;o
$ent upon their G$in, by that we call
Clande&s;tine Trade, that they would even
<PB N="4" REF="15">
venture to Import the Plague it &s;elf, if
they were to get by it, and &s;o give it
to all that liv'd near them, not valuing
the gro&s;s and horrid Inju&s;tice that they
do to other People; what a Man ventures
for him&s;elf in nothing, becau&s;e it is his own
Act and Deed; but what he ventures for
others, is the wor&s;t of Violence upon
them, and perhaps in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this,
is the wor&s;t &s;ort of Murther.</P>
<P>This Vice in our Commerce, is intro|duc'd
by the Nece&s;&s;ity this N$tion has
been in, of Clogging Foreign Trade with
heavy Duties and Impo&s;ts; which gives
Encouragement to Smugglers and Run|ners
of Goods, to venture at all Hazards
to bring &s;uch Goods in upon us private|ly;
and the&s;e Men, I doubt I may &s;ay
without Injuring them, Value not what
the Goods are or whence they come, &s;o
they can but bring them on Shore free of
the Duties and Impo&s;ts I &s;peak of: We
have Examples of this before us, which
ju&s;tifies the Charge, and I need &s;ay no
more to prove it.</P>
<P>The Preparations again&s;t the Plague
in this Ca&s;e, mu&s;t be the Work of the
Government. It is con&s;e&s;s'd, that this is
a Difficulty even to the Government it
&s;elf, and it will be hard to &s;ay what they
can do more than is done Effectually to pre|vent
<PB N="5" REF="16">
this dreadful Trade, and without
&s;ome very great Severity, I believe it will
never be done; and yet till it is done,
we cannot pretend to take effectual
Mea&s;ures in this Nation for preventing
the Plague coming among us.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians &s;eem at pre&s;ent to fall
in with the <HI>French</HI> Methods, <HI>viz&punc;</HI> of pre|venting
the &s;preading of Infection, by
&s;urrounding the Towns where it &s;hall
happen to be, with Troops of Soldiers;
Cutting of$ all Communication with the
Countries, or Parts of the Country where
&s;uch Towns are that &s;hall be Infected:
This Dr <HI>Mead</HI> has been pleas$d to pro|po&s;e
al&s;o in his Treati&s;e, call'd, <HI>A Short
Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t Con$e&s;s, I do not &s;ee that this can
be made practicable in <HI>England;</HI> and we &s;ee
already it h$s not been Effectual in <HI>France,</HI>
notwith&s;tanding greater Severities have
been us'd there, than I pre&s;ume will ever
be allow'd to be us$d here: <HI>For Example,</HI>
The Plague began in <HI>Provence,</HI> in Part
of the Country the mo&s;t ea&s;ily &s;$para|ted
from the re&s;t of the World or any
that can be &s;ingled out on their Side,
as will apper by the Situation of the
Country. The South Part of <HI>Provence,</HI>
or as &s;ome call it, the <HI>Lower Provence,</HI> is
&s;urrounded by Water on three Sides, and
<PB N="6" REF="17">
by the unp$&s;&s;ible Mountains of <HI>Piedmont</HI>
and <HI>N$$ce</HI> on the $ourch Side; <HI>That is
to &s;ay,</HI> it is Bounded by the Sea from
the &s;aid Mountains to the Mouth of the
Gre$t River <HI>Rh$&s;ne,</HI> on the <HI>South: On
the We&s;t,</HI> it is Bounded by the &s;aid Ri|ver
<HI>Rho&s;ne,</HI> to the Mouth of the <HI>Du|rance,</HI>
on the Sou$h$ &s;ide of the Di&s;trict
of <HI>Avignon: And on the North,</HI> it is Bound|ed
by the &s;aid River <HI>Durance,</HI> to the
Mouth of the River <HI>Verdon,</HI> and thence
by the River <HI>Verdon,</HI> to the Foot of the
&s;aid Mountains of <HI>Piedmont.</HI></P>
<P>On the South-&s;ide, 'tis allow'd there
needed no Guard, the Nature of the
Thing Arm'd all the World, from re|ceiving
any Ve&s;te$ coming from <HI>Pro|vence,</HI>
or &s;uffering the People out of them
to Land; and i$ I am not mi&s;inform$d,
&s;everal People that did put to Sea, (as it
were de&s;perate from thence) are &s;till mi&s;|&s;ing,
and it is believ'd have Peri&s;h'd at
Sea, having not been allow'd to &s;et their
F$et on Shore in any part of the World.</P>
<P>On the Side of the <HI>Rho&s;ne,</HI> the We&s;t
$anks of that River have been &s;o well
Guarded, that nothing has been able to
pa&s;s; and tho' the I&s;lands in the Mouth
of the <HI>Rho&s;ne,</HI> h$ve been infected, the di&s;|tre&s;s'd
People of <HI>Arles,</HI> having almo&s;t by
Force gotten out among them at <HI>La Ca|morgue,
<PB N="7" REF="18">
Salons,</HI> and other Places; yet
the River being Great and the Naviga|tion
of it wholly &s;t$pp'd, the Di&s;temper
has been kept o$f on that Side.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> side al&s;o, the Mountains
and the Fronti$rs of <HI>Nice,</HI> have been
&s;o well Guarded by the Troops of <HI>Pied|mont,</HI>
and the Pa&s;$es of tho&s;e Moun|tains
are &s;o few, &s;o difficult, and &s;o ea&s;y
to be clos$d up, that very few of the
People have attempted to E&s;cape that way,
and tho&s;e that have attempted it, have
been fir'd at and driven back, or if pre&s;|&s;ing
forward have been Kill'd.</P>
<P>But on the <HI>North</HI> Side, the Ca&s;e has
been quite different, for the <HI>Durance</HI> and
the <HI>Verdon</HI> are &s;maller R$vers, and in
many Places Fordable; $o that in &s;pight
of all the Guards plac'd in their Lines,
and the Vigilance of the Patroles on the
Bank of the River, Men have made their
Elcape in the Dark, and by private Ways,
and have gotten into the Mountains, and
from thence being acquainted with the
Country, have pa&s;s'd on from Place to
Place till they have found Retreats and
been receiv'd by their Friends, and Con|ceal'd
as they de&s;ir'd; &s;ome indeed, have
been di&s;cover'd and have been driven
back, and others have been Kill'd; but
certain it is&punc; that among the many of
<PB N="8" REF="19">
the&s;e de&s;perate People, which have thus
got away, &s;ome have been Touch'd with the
Contagion: Nay, &s;ome that perhaps have
thought them&s;elves Sound and in Health,
and the&s;e have carry'd it with them to
the Places where they made their $etreat.</P>
<P>Thus a Galley Slave, who made his
E&s;cape from <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and as it is &s;aid,
reach'd to his Brother's Hou&s;e at <HI>La Ca|norgue</HI>
in the <HI>Gevaudan,</HI> carry'd the
Plague with him; and thus it broke out
at once 140 Miles off of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and
all the Precautions, Guards, Lines, Pa|troles,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> u&s;ed to prevent its coming
out of the <HI>Nether Provinces,</HI> were at once
De$eated.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame Accident, it has &s;pread it
&s;elf in the <HI>Gevaudan</HI> from one Village to
another, and from one Town to another,
till as by the la&s;t Account we are told, a|bove
an Hundred Villages and Towns
are Vi&s;ited in that Part of the Country,
and the Infection is &s;pread into the <HI>Viva|rez</HI>
on one Side, the Dioce&s;s of <HI>&V;zes</HI> on
another, the Province of <HI>Auv$rgne</HI> on a
third, and into <HI>Rovergve</HI> on a fourth Side,
and yet at all the&s;e Places, the Towns In|fected
are immediately Inve&s;ted, and all
Communication with them cut off as
&s;oon as it is known they are Infected;
and all the other Regulations ob&s;erv'd,
<PB N="9" REF="20">
which are directed by the Government
there.</P>
<P>This now is the Effect of &s;urrounding
of Towns with Lines and with Soldiers,
and Impri&s;oning the People again&s;t their
Will, forbidding the Sound &s;eparating
them&s;elves from the Sick, which they
mu&s;t needs take for an un&s;ufferable Cruel|ty,
and by which means they make the
People De&s;perate and Mad: So that ra|ther
than &s;tay in the Place to be poi&s;on|ed
with the Breath of dying People, and
be certainly Infected with the &s;tench of
Bodies Dead or Sick of the Plague, they
venture at all Hazards to make their
E&s;cape, and in Effecting this, Infect their
Friends; and thus it will be among us I
doubt not, if ever &s;uch Methods are put
in practice here.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as they can have no pretence
to Inve&s;t a Town, or Prohibit the Inha|bitants
from quitting it till it is Infected,
they put tho&s;e Inhabitants upon all po&s;&s;i|ble
means of Concealing the Infection
when it is begun, $$ll tho&s;e who are in
the Secret of it can make their E&s;cape;
and thus they Travel &s;ecurely with the
Di&s;temper upon them, and emi$ the Ef|fluvia
of Infection wherever they come:
Thus the City of <HI>$$ignon</HI> was Infected a
Month and Seven days, <HI>viz.</HI> from the
<PB N="10" REF="21">
17th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to the 23d of <HI>September</HI> be|fore
it was publickly known in the Coun|try
round; &s;o that People went freely in|to
the City from all the Villages about
<HI>Avignon,</HI> and the Citizens went freely out
into the Country, and the Di&s;temper was
fetch'd by one and carried by the oth$r,
without any precaution to all the Neigh|bouring
Towns for &s;everal Leagues round
the Place&punc; &s;everal of which Towns are
more $atally touch'd with the Contagion
than the City it&s;elf, as <HI>Bedarid$s</HI> and <HI>Sorgues,</HI>
on the North, <HI>Barbantine</HI> on the South,
and even at length the City of <HI>Orange</HI>
it &s;elf; and now they are oblig'd to quit
the old Lines and po&s;t on the Bank of
the River <HI>Durance,</HI> and to draw a new
Line near 100 Miles in Length, <HI>to wit,</HI>
from St. <HI>Paul de Trois Cha&s;tean</HI> on the
<HI>Rho&s;ne</HI> to <HI>Montbrun</HI> Ea&s;t, and from thence
down to <HI>Lauris</HI> on the <HI>Durance</HI> on the
South, and &s;o on the Bank of that River
to its fall into the <HI>Rho&s;ne</HI> We&s;t; and yet
all the&s;e Lines &s;eem not to be capable to
effect the Thing propos'd by them, for
when the Inhabitants are thus made de&s;|perate
by Locking up the Sound with the
Sick, they do and will find ways to E&s;|cape
whatever Hazard it may be to them|&s;elves
or others.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="22">
Whereas if the People were left at their
Liberty, except as was practis'd here in
the time of the la&s;t Vi&s;itation, <HI>viz.</HI> by
&s;hutting up Hou&s;es known to be Infected.
I &s;ay, if the People were left at Liberty,
tho&s;e that did flee at all, would flee be|fore
they were Infected, and thereby &s;ave
their Lives, and likewi&s;e not carry the
Di&s;temper with them when they went.</P>
<P>In the next place, the Cutting off the
Communication of one part of the Coun|try
with another in <HI>England,</HI> would be
&s;uch a General Interruption of Trade,
that it would entirely ruin the Coun|tries
and Towns &s;o cut off, and the Peo|ple
would be very Tumultuous and
unea&s;y upon that Head.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me a much more rational
Method, that as &s;oon as any Town or
Village appears to be Vi&s;ited, all the
Sound People of the Town be immedi|ately
removed and oblig'd to go to &s;ome
certain particular Place, where Barracks
&s;hould be built for them, or Tents pitch'd
for them, and where they &s;hould be ob|lig'd
to perform a Quarantain of Days,
and after that to be admitted to go
whether they pleas'd, except back to the
Town from whence they came, if they
thought fit to remain where they were
till the Town or Village infected was
<PB N="12" REF="23">
entirely re&s;tor'd, and had been &s;o for a
full Qu$rantain, then they might be ad|mitted
again; and if any Families prov'd
to have the Di&s;temper in their Encamp|ment,
they &s;hould remove again, leaving
the Sick Families behind: And thus con|tinually
moving the Sound from the
Sick, the Di&s;temper would abate of
Cour&s;e, and the Contagion be le&s;s &s;trong
by how much fewer Per&s;ons were In|fected
with it,</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain than that the
Contagion &s;trengthens, and the infectious
Particles in the Air, if any &s;uch there are,
encrea&s;e in Quantity, as the greater Num|ber
of Sick Bodies are kept together: The
Effluvia emitted from Bodies Infected, are
more Rank and more Contagious, and are
carry'd farther in the Air, the more Bodies
are Infected, and are therefore more apt to
be receiv'd from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e; and were
it po&s;&s;ible for all the People in the Po|pulous
Cities and Towns in <HI>England,</HI> to
&s;eparate on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion as this; and
&s;pread them&s;elves over the whole King|dom
in &s;maller Numbers, and at proper
Di&s;tances from one another, 'tis evident
even to Demon&s;tration, that the Plague
would have but very little Power, and
the Effects of it be very little felt: For
we &s;ee evidently that the Plague is car|ry'd
<PB N="13" REF="24">
from one to another, by Infected
Per&s;ons conver&s;ing with one another, or
by Cloths, Goods, Hou&s;hold Stuff or
Merchandizes, (which have been In|fected)
being carried from one Place to
another and not by any General Stagna|tion
of Air, or Noxious Fumes infecting
the Air, or Poi&s;onous Particles carry'd
by the Winds from one Country to ano|ther,
or from one City to another, as &s;ome
have imagin'd.</P>
<P>The Effluvia of Infected Bodies may,
and mu&s;t be indeed convey'd from one to
another by Air, &s;o Words are convey'd
from the Mouth of the Speaker to the
Ear of the Hearer by the Interpo&s;ition
and Vibration of the Air, and the like of
all Sounds; but tho&s;e Effluvia cannot
extend them&s;elves a great Way, but like
ill Smells as they &s;pread they die in the
Air, or a&s;cend and &s;eparate, lo&s;e them|&s;elves,
and are rarify'd in the Air, &s;o as
to lo&s;e all their Noxious or Infectious
Quality.</P>
<P>As the Flavour of an <HI>Orange</HI> Garden,
which in calm Weather would be mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ibly felt at a Di&s;tance all round the
Trees, will be lo&s;t immediately, in a
High Wind, and be only &s;melt that way
which the Wind Blows.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="25">
In the like Ca&s;e, I would caution tho&s;e
People who live in the out Parts of, or
adjacent Places to infected Towns, to
ob&s;erve the Blowing of the Winds, and if
the Wind Blows from the City towards
them, let them for the Time keep their
Windows &s;hut on that Side next the &s;aid
Town or City Infected, and e&s;pecially
not &s;tand Talking or drawing in the Air
into their Mouths that way; but if the
Wind blows the other way, and Blows
to the &s;aid infected City or Town, then
they may freely open their Windows and
Doors, and Breathe or Talk as they will; and
this, becau&s;e the Stench of the Town may
be carried &s;ome &s;mall length on the Wings
of the Wind; But let no Man fill the
Heads of his Neighbours with the Whim|&s;ey
of doing this at any con&s;iderable Di|&s;tance,
&s;uch as four or five Miles or more;
the Na$ure of the Thing making it im|po&s;&s;ible
that the poi&s;onous Effluvia can
keep together &s;o long, or fly &s;o low as in
that part of the Air we Breathe in, at &s;o
great a Di&s;tance from the Place.</P>
<P>If on the contrary, we pretend by Lines
and Troops to Inve&s;t, or Surround an
infected Place, or a Part of the Country
where &s;uch an infected Town may lie:
I affirm, that it is not to be expected that
this can be &s;o effectually done, as to be
<PB N="15" REF="26">
certain that none of the People &s;hall get
out: And be&s;ides, the Cruelty of Locking
up &s;o many Sound People with the Sick, I
&s;ay, it will never be effectually done.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all&punc; for the &s;tanding Troops,
they are not &s;ufficient in Number, and 'tis
&s;uppos'd the Parliament will hardly con|&s;ent
to rai&s;e a new Army for &s;uch a Pur|po&s;e:
As for the Militia, how far they
may be depended upon for &s;uch a Ser|vice,
I refer to judgment: The Militia
are Compos'd of the Inhabitants of the
Neighbouring Towns and Counties where
they &s;erve; it will not be ea&s;y to pre|vent
their conniving at the E&s;cape of an
Innocent Neighbour, or to prevail upon
them to Kill a poor hone&s;t Countryman,
for endeavouring only to &s;ave his own
Life, or to prevent their taking Money
to wink and look another way, or to
take a wrong Aim if they Shoot; and
after all &s;uppo&s;e them faithful, it will
not be &s;o difficult for bold and re&s;olute
Men, who being made de&s;perate by the
Di&s;tre&s;s they are in, care not for the Ri&s;que,
and are as willing to die one way as ano|ther:
I &s;ay, it will not be &s;o difficult
for 20 or 30 Men to join together in the
Night; and with Arms in their Hands,
to break through the Militia Men; who
'tis known are no great Schollars at the
<PB N="16" REF="27">
Trade of Souldering, when if they were
regular Troops, they would not venture
it upon any Terms.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter here upon the Debate
of the Inva&s;ion of Liberty, and the Ruin
of Property, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily at|tend
&s;uch a Practice as this, I mean in
Ca&s;e of Inve&s;ting Towns; the Equity of
the Ca&s;e does by no means agree with
things done in Ca&s;es of other Extremities,
as the Blowing up of Hou&s;es in Ca&s;e of
Fire, Drowning Lands in Ca&s;e of an Ene|my,
and the like; but this is really &s;hed|ding
Innocent Blood, which is a kind of
Evil not to be done that good may come,
no not of any kind.</P>
<P>More e&s;pecially, I object again&s;t this, as it
is not likely to an&s;wer the Means pro|pos'd:
For Example, &s;hould an Infected Per|&s;on
by any adventure whatever, Land at a
Town on our Coa&s;t, and which God of his
infinite Mercy avert, &s;hould he Infect the
Family where he is Lodg'd: Shall 20
or 30000 People, who perhaps Inhabit
that Town, be immediately &s;urrounded,
and as it were ty'd to the infected Family,
till Five Parts in Six of them peri&s;h?
This was, as I am inform'd, the Ca&s;e of
the City of <HI>Thoulon,</HI> only that the Num|ber
dead there, was exceedingly more;
certainly if on the fir&s;t Suprize, the
<PB N="17" REF="28">
Inhabitants of that Place had been permit|ted,
or indeed, order'd to retire to &s;ome
proper Place at a Di&s;tance from the City,
and &s;eparated as they might have been the
Lives of 40000 People in that Town, and
the Villages near it, had been &s;aved.</P>
<P>It is true, that in the Time of the la&s;t
great Plague here, Hou&s;es Infected were
&s;hut up; and it is true, that the &s;hut|ting
up a Hou&s;e is the &s;ame Thing in
its Proportion, for that the Sound ar$
there &s;hut up with the Sick as it is in a
Town; but the Ca&s;e with Submi&s;&s;ion is
not the &s;ame, for here the Sound have
time to go away, they may Conceal the
Infected Sick Per&s;on &s;o long, till they that
are willing in the Family to remove are
removed, and then they are not driven
back again like Murtherers, or Shot
dead for going away.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, in private Hou&s;es, there is
&s;ome difference in the Equity of it, how
they are all of a Family, and have &s;ome
Obligation upon them to take the Ri&s;qu$
one with another; but it is not the &s;ame
in a whole Town, and I cannot but
think Men have a natural Right to
flee for the Pre&s;ervation of their Lives,
e&s;pecially while they are Sound and Un|tainted
with the Infection; and 'tis a
piece of Cruelty incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on,
<PB N="18" REF="29">
that becau&s;e the Di&s;temper has reach'd,
&s;uppo&s;e a Hou&s;e or Family, at one end
of a Town, th$$$ therefore the Families
at the other end of the Town who are
untouch'd, &s;hould be Impri&s;on'd and be
bound to &s;t$y w$ere they are till it comes
to them; and thus as it were Condemn
them to Death for that which is their
Di&s;a&s;ter not their Crime, and kill tho&s;e
People for the good of others, of wh$m
the others were in no Danger.</P>
<P>As for the Arguments drawn from
Nece&s;&s;ity and the public Saic$y, 'tis ful|ly
an&s;wer'd in the Prop$$$&s;al above, of
removing the Sound People wholly from
the Place, and cau&s;ing them to Encamp
either in Te$ts or Barracks, as the Sea&s;on
will permit, till the Infection is over.</P>
<P>And this I take to be a much better
way, (e&s;pecially where the Towns are
not too $$ge.) than removing the Sick
immediately into Barracks, becau&s;e the
Sound can go $$fely away from the Sick,
and injure no Body in the Remove, where|as
the People to be concern'd in remov|ing
the Sick, and the Hou&s;es they go out
of, nay, even the Air as they go along
or are carried along, may receive the In|fection
from them, and it may be many
ways dangerous to remove them, as well
to others as to them&s;elves: But there is
<PB N="19" REF="30">
no Danger of any kind in the Sound go|ing
away from the Sick, except the Dan|ger
of any infected Per&s;on going with
them, which mu&s;t be carfully Guarded
again&s;t; and they mu&s;t remove their Camp
as often as we find that $appen.</P>
<P>It is true, this cannot be done in
<HI>London,</HI> or in other con&s;iderable Cities in
General; that is to &s;ay, not by all the
Inhabitants, and there will be always a
great Number of people, who care not
to remove&punc; whatever Hazard they run:
Some if they &s;hould remove, know not
whether to go; others have not Sub&s;i&s;|tence
to Support them if they remove,
and others even though they cou'd re|move
and have Sub&s;tance &s;ufficient, yet
will not venture The&s;e we have nothing to
&s;ay to, neither is there room to &s;ay any
thing of them; what is &s;aid above re|lates
only&punc; to &s;uch as being de&s;irous to
remove, are not permitted, no not al|tho'
they are really Sound and free from
the Infection.</P>

even to the giving them rea&s;ona|ble
Allowances for their Travelling; that

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That all &s;uch Per&s;ons as have

it was before; for tho' there would
&s;till be many Thou&s;ands of the Inhabi|tants

and who would in &s;uch a
Calamity only &s;erve to Infect one ano|ther,
and &s;trengthen the Contagion in

<P>It might be rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e,
that upon this di&s;per&s;ing of the poor

of <HI>London</HI> would be Ab&s;ent, includ|ing

Part we might make &s;ome Gue&s;s, by what
was the Ca&s;e in the la&s;t Plague in 1665
the removing of the Inhabitants was at

the Report of tho&s;e that were then liv|ing;
I &s;ay it was then very great, for fir&s;t
the whole Court remov'd to <HI>Oxford,</HI> there
was neither Parliament or Term held in
<HI>London;</HI> &s;o that all the Nobility and Gen|try,

the Pa&s;&s;ages every where &s;top'd, nothing
was to be &s;een at the great Hou&s;es of the

but a Servant or two to look after the
Hou&s;e, or perhaps no Body within on|ly
a Watchman or two at the Gate
Night and Day, to prevent Robbing the
Hou&s;e; and as the Plague began in St.
<HI>Giles</HI>'s Pari&s;h, the People at that End of
the Town fled fir&s;t; &s;o that the Streets

barricado'd at both Ends, the Inhabitants
being entirely removed and gone. In the

the Families were thin, half or more of
them gone; and this was, without doubt,
the Rea&s;on why the Number that dy'd
in the City, was much &s;maller in propor|tion
than in any other part, there dy|ing
more by 4551 in the two Pari&s;hes
of <HI>Stepn$y</HI> and <HI>White Chappel,</HI> than in the
whole 97 Pari&s;hes within the Walls.</P>
<P>This was doubtle&s;s owing to the few|ne&s;s
of the Inhabitants within the Walls,
where the People being generally Weal|thy,
provided for them&s;elves and their Fa|milies
<PB N="26" REF="37">
by an early Flight into the Country;
whereas in the Out-parts, the People liv|ing
thicker and clo&s;er together, and be|ing
Poor and wanting Conveniencies, and
not able to flee for want of Friends or
Money, or both, died in heaps and
&s;trengthen'd the Contagion by their
Numbers.</P>
<P>It is a Con&s;ideration well worth the
Concern of the Publick, how many ways
a u&s;eful and valuable Charity it would
be to have the Children of the poorer and
middling &s;ort of People remov'd at &s;uch
a time as that, into Places of Health and
Air, and to have them taken care of for
one Year: I cannot think but well inclin|ed
Chri&s;tians, were it propos'd to them,
would Contribute largely to &s;uch a Pro|po&s;al,
and what Charity and Alms would
not effect, publick Stocks &s;hould &s;upply:
I cannot doubt but a Parliament wou'd
con&s;ider &s;uch a Thing, and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome
Fund payable by the City, either by a
Tax on Coals, a Toll on Cattle and Corn,
con&s;um'd in the City, or &s;ome &s;uch Thing,
upon the Security of which, Money wou'd
be ea&s;ily rais'd to an&s;wer the Expence.</P>
<P>By this means, the Lives of an Hundred
Thou&s;and poor innocent Creatures, who,
as God was pleas'd to &s;ay of <HI>Nineveth,</HI> know
not their Right-hand from their Left,
<PB N="27" REF="38">
would be &s;av'd, and tho&s;e Children be
pre&s;erv'd for the Good of Po&s;terity; mo&s;t
of whom would otherwi&s;e inevitably Pe|ri&s;h,
&s;ome by Want, &s;ome by Neglect,
&s;ome by the lo&s;s of their Parents, and the
re&s;t by the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>But by this means, not a Child would be
le&s;t in the whole City of <HI>London,</HI> and in
all its va&s;t extended Suburbs; whereas
the Di&s;tre&s;s of poor Families in the time
of the la&s;t Plague, by rea&s;on of the great
Numbers of Children that lay &s;tarving
upon their Hands, was inexpre&s;&s;ible, and
the Numbers of them that Peri&s;h'd in the
Streets and in empty Hou&s;es, and in o|ther
Places full of Mi&s;ery, added exceed|ingly
to the Height of the Bills of Mor|tallity.</P>
<P>When
I &s;ay an Hundred Thou&s;and, I
do not &s;ugge&s;t that there are but an
Hundred Thou&s;and Children of 14 Years
old and under, I believe there would be
found near three times the Number with|in
the Extent of the Bills of Mortallity;
but I &s;uppo&s;e, One Hundred Thou&s;and of
the&s;e to be meerly the Children of Mi&s;ery
and Di&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch as mu&s;t be wholly
provided for by Charity, and that the
re&s;t &s;hould be either di&s;pos'd of by their
Parents, or by the City; <HI>that is,</HI> by the
Publick, the Parents paying a competent
<PB N="28" REF="39">
Sum towards their Maintenance as their
Ability &s;hould appear.</P>
<P>Be it which way it will, I in&s;i&s;t upon
it, that there &s;hould not a Child be le$t
in the City under 14 Years of Age: I
could give many Rea&s;ons why &s;uch a Step
as this would be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the
Pre&s;erving the Health of the City, but
I think it will not be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>Having thus clear'd the City of all the
Poor, and of all the Children, and of all
the whole Families of tho&s;e who can and
will voluntarily flee, I think it will not
be needful to &s;ay, that all other living
Creatures &s;hould be &s;ent away or de&s;troy|ed:
<HI>Such as</HI> Dogs, Cats, Monkeys, Parrots,
and any Creatures that eat Fle&s;h all &s;hould
be de&s;troy'd, whether it be Bea&s;t or Bird,
and e&s;pecially all the Wea&s;els, Rats and
Mice if po&s;&s;ible, the fir&s;t of the&s;e, as to
Dogs and Cats, was done in the l$ft Vi&s;i|$ation
<HI>Anno</HI> 1665, but not the latter.</P>
<P>Al&s;o it is my Opinion, that there &s;hould
not be a Swine, $eg or Sow, le&s;t alive
among the Streets, or near them, n$, nor
a Hor&s;e, not that the Hor&s;e him&s;elf ab|&s;tractedly
con&s;ider'd, cou'd be dangerous;
but as the St$bles they are kept in, their
Dung, and the St$le or Water that comes
from them, occa&s;ions an ill Scent: It &s;hould
be prevented by removing the Hor&s;es al|&s;o
of all &s;orts.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="40">

well be placed to the Account of the

bring all the Wa&s;h and Filth of the

The like might be &s;aid of other Places,
but the Proportions are not &s;o well
known, &s;o I dwell no longer upon that
Part: I have mentioned the&s;e Things, to
&s;how how the Opinions of the Phy&s;ici|ans
concerning Na&s;tine&s;s and Nauceious
Smells, that they are Injurious and Dan|gerous,
that they propagate Infection, and
are a means to encrea&s;e the Plague, is
ju&s;t, and that Mea&s;ures ought to be taken
to prevent the&s;e Things, by keeping the
Streets clean, well Pav'd and Swept, as
the Grand Juries have pre&s;ented: Ad|ding
withal, That the Tide Ditches in
<HI>Southwark,</HI> at the <HI>Falcon, Lambeth, Rotherh$th
Hor&s;lydown, &amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be cleans'd and
kept full of Water by proper Sluices, to
be emptied and let go every Spring-Tide,
or el&s;e fill'd up and not &s;uffer'd
any more: Al&s;o that the Gulleys and
Common Shores, running into the <HI>Thames</HI>
on the City Side; &s;uch as one at St.
<HI>Catharines,</HI> one at <HI>Iron-Gate,</HI> one near the
Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e, one at <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> another
at <HI>Dowgate,</HI> and &s;everal others, ought to
be &s;unk Deeper, Arch'd over, and car|ry'd
down to low Water Mark.</P>
<P>But I leave this, as al&s;o the Managing
of <HI>Fleet Ditch,</HI> and the upper part of it,
e&s;pecially between <HI>Holborn-Bridge</HI> and
<HI>Hockley</HI> in the <HI>Hole,</HI> a Nauceious and a|bominable
<PB N="36" REF="47">
Sink of publick Na&s;tine&s;s. I
&s;ay, I leave the&s;e Things to the Con&s;ide|ration
of the Magi&s;trates, who, if they
have any Regard to the Health of the
Inhabitants, will certainly think that
part worth their while to take Notice
of.</P>
<P>I go on (2.) in my own Method to
&s;uch Precautions or Preparations, as are
Private and Per&s;onal; and which I ob|&s;erve,
are not much thought of by many
People, though I believe the mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary
of all the re&s;t. It is true, that the
nauceious Places whi$h I have mention'd,
are of dangerous Con&s;equence in their
kind: But I mu&s;t &s;ay, that People ought
to turn their Thoughts to Clean&s;ing a
wor&s;e Jakes than that of the Tide-Ditches
in <HI>Southwark</HI> or <HI>Fleet-Ditch, &amp;c.</HI>
and that is, that the People, e&s;pecially
&s;uch as are to &s;tay here at all Adventures,
&s;hould Univer&s;ally clean&s;e them&s;elves,
clean&s;e their Bodies of all Scorbutick
Di&s;tempers, ill Habits, and e&s;pecially bad
Dige&s;tures, gro&s;s Di&s;tempers, and the like:
It is the Doctor's Bu&s;ine&s;s to tell every
Man according to his particular Con|&s;itution,
and according to the Tempe|rature
of his Body and Blood what is
fit for him to do. I only here Argue
<PB N="37" REF="48">
the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Thing in General,
and touch &s;ome general Methods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I know Doctor <HI>Mead,</HI> is not a great
Friend to Evacuations in General, and
he &s;ays, indeed, that he would not have
Men bring them&s;elves too low, and make
too large Evacuations, for that it is be&s;t
to keep the Spirit in &s;ome Vigor, and
this is good Advice, where Men are in
a State of perfect Health as 'tis call'd, be|cau&s;e
Nature ought to be Cheri&s;h'd and
kept in Heart, that &s;he may be able to
encounter the great Enemy that threatens
to Invade her. But the Doctor, with
Submi&s;&s;ion to his skill, mi&s;takes the Ca&s;e:
At the time of the Infection I would not by
any means have People bring them&s;elves
down or &s;ink their Spirits by too large
Evacuations: But taking the Ca&s;e early,
and by way of Preparation, that is to &s;ay,
&s;ix Months or more before the Infection
comes, then it is quite another Thing;
then there is time to recover the Spirits
and re&s;tore the Blood, before the time
of the Di&s;tre&s;s comes upom them. Then
is the time, to Clean&s;e the Jakes, as I call
it, I mean the Stomach, and to Purge
off the foul corrupted Humours, colec|ted
by long Intemperance, luxurious Eat|ing,
Gorging the Stomach with Sauces
and high Di$t, Inflaming the Blood with
<PB N="38" REF="49">
innumerable Debauches of Wine and the
like: I &s;ay now is the time for Clean|&s;ing
the Stomach and Bowels, and for pre|paring
the Body, by delivering Nature
from all the Burthens &s;he was loaded
with before.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, where an ill &s;tate of Health
is the Ca&s;e, though it be not &s;o long
before the time, the Thing differs ex|tremely,
and the Man is under a diffe|rent
Nece&s;&s;ity: For he is concern'd to
deliver him&s;elf from the Enemy he has
already within him, lea&s;t that Enemy
&s;hould Con$ederate with the Enemy with|out,
and &s;o the Man &s;hould be plung'd
before he is aware.</P>
<P>That the State of our Body at the
time of the Infection, renders it more or
le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of the Infection it&s;elf, no
Man of common Sen&s;e will Di&s;pute.
There is a Sympathy of Parts between
the Body and the Di&s;temper, while the
Body is clogg'd, the Blood corrupt, the
Stomach foul, doubtle&s;s to receive infected
poi&s;onous Vapours into the Body at that
time, mu&s;t put the whole Ma&s;s of Blood
into new Ferments: We receive Poi&s;on
one of another&punc; and we emit Poi&s;on one
to another; and thus the Plague is pro|pagated,
though we know not the Mo|dus
in every particular Per&s;on, for I
<PB N="39" REF="50">
will not doubt that the Infection or Di|&s;temper
is Contagious.</P>
<P>If we would be freed from receiving
Infection, we &s;hould certainly a&s;&s;ure our
&s;elves that we have no Infection already
lodg'd in us; and this mu&s;t be try'd in
an effectual Manner: The Glands of the
Stomach &s;hould be cleans'd by frequent
Emeticks but gentle, the Venome of
antient Di&s;tempers, &s;hould be purg'd
out of the Blood, and therefore gentle
Salivations would be excellent Prepara|tions
where they can be allow'd of; and
let no Man object the Scandal of that
Medicine, it is certainly admini&s;ter'd in
modern Practice with great Succe&s;s, in
Ca&s;es not at all Venereal, and con&s;equent|ly
not Scandalous: The Blood as well
as the Body mu&s;t be Cleans'd, and no|thing
can &s;o effectually give, as it were,
a New and Infant Blood as this of Sa|livation:
And I dur&s;t Mortgage all my
Skill in Phy&s;ick, if any one Per&s;on, who
being in an ordinary State of Health, &s;o
as not to be Sick of any capital Di&s;temper,
having taken this a few Days, and in but
a moderate Degree. I &s;ay, if any one of
the&s;e &s;hould be affected by the Plague.</P>
<P>But pray take this with you as you go,
that the Evacuations or other Remedies
which I am now &s;peaking of, are not &s;up|pos'd
<PB N="40" REF="51">
to be &s;o much as thought of after
the Infection is come; Nay, not only not
after it is come into the Body, and has
touch'd the Spirits, but I &s;ay, not after
it is come into the Place, for then when
the Enemy is at the Door, all the Forces
of Nature are to be mu&s;ter'd together; but
all the Reinforcements and Encourage|ments
that are proper to &s;trengthen Na|ture
for her Defence, &s;hould be brought
to her Aid. No Garri&s;on ought to have
their Fortifications to build, when the
Siege again&s;t them is laid; all the Parts
&s;hould be done and fini&s;hed before, and
when the Siege is laid and the Enemy
are Battering their Works the Bu&s;ine&s;s then
is to Counter Batter him, Harra&s;s him
with continual Sallies, and be Vigilant, rea|dy
on all his A&s;&s;aults to repel his Forces.</P>
<P>The Simily or Allu&s;ion, I hope, is not
improper, due Evacuations as above, and
after that temperate and whole&s;ome
Dyet are the Fortifications of Nature,
and ought to be the Practice of Time as
long before Hand as po&s;&s;ible. But when
the Enemy is come, then rea&s;onable En|couragement
ought to be given to the
Animal Spirits, which are the Garri&s;on

<P>What I &s;ay now, is to explain my O|pinion
about Purging and Clean&s;ing the
Body by due Evacuations, Namely&punc; That I
particularly limit this to the time we have
to prepare again&s;t the Plague; and that
the&s;e Purgings and Clean&s;ings &s;hould be
done now immediately, that Nature being
delivered in time from all foulne&s;s of the
Stomach, or Burthens on the Con&s;titution,
may be &s;trengthen'd again, and re&s;tor'd
in time, by proper A&s;&s;i&s;tance, for the Com|bat
with her great Enemy.</P>
<P>All Sinks and Receptacles of Filthine&s;s,
&s;ay the Doctors, mu&s;t be Cleans'd for the
pre&s;erving our Healths, by &s;weetening
the Air we breathe in, but what a
Sink and Receptacle of Filth is the Body
of Man? How is he to be re&s;tor'd but
by Clean&s;ing and Purging off the noxi|ous
Slime and Corroded Juices which
are di&s;per&s;ed in all the Ve&s;&s;els of his Body,
even tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els which common Cathar|ticks
will not reach.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="53">
It is upon this Account, that I pro|po&s;e
to as many as have Courage for
&s;uch a Medicine the u&s;e of a gentle Sa|l$vation.</P>
<P>The

when an Infection comes? Who can

will meet an Infection with gro&s;s and
foul Bodies, corrupted with the nauceious
Fumes of ill dige&s;ted Meats; with a Blood
inflam'd with Exce&s;&s;es and Intemperance,
whether of one &s;ort or of another, and
will not apply them&s;elves to &s;uch Re|medies

the Practice of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who upon
Principles of Prede&s;tination, Vi&s;it their
Friends when the Plague is upon them, go
<PB N="43" REF="54">
promi&s;cuou&s;ly and unconcern'd one among
another upon their ordinary Occa&s;ions,
without &s;o much as Enquiring whether
the Plague be among them or not, or de|clining
them when they know it is.</P>
<P>But if we believe the Plague is receiv'd
by Contagion, and that Means may
be made u&s;e o$ to prevent it, we ought
then to u&s;e tho&s;e Means which are pro|per,
and u&s;e them in the time that is pro|per
too otherwi&s;e we may as well omit
the Means wholly, and leave all to Na|ture
and Providence.</P>
<P>I might enter here upon an ea&s;y Proof,
that our ordinary way of Living in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
requires the&s;e Evacuations more
than is the Ca&s;e of the People of other
Nations, and that if the Infection &s;hould
come among us, <HI>which I pray God to pre|vent,</HI>
it will find much more Fuel to
feed on, than it does in other Coun|tries
where People live more Tempe|rately,
and where they feed cleaner
than we do here.</P>
<P>We &s;aw plainly the Difference in this
Matter, in the late great Plague in <HI>Sweeden</HI>
and <HI>Denmark,</HI> where the Malignity of the
Di&s;temper was far le&s;s, than in <HI>England</HI>
in 1665, and even in the Plague in 1665,
we found our People in the <HI>South Parts,</HI>
where we live more plentifully and feed
<PB N="44" REF="55">
more gro&s;ly, were much more violently
Infected, than in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or in the <HI>North</HI>
of <HI>England,</HI> even in proportion to the
Numbers.</P>
<P>Next therefore to Medicines for the
Carrying off the Fund of Di&s;temper which
is to be found in us, and which we owe
to the irregular Diet and intemperance
of our People, I mu&s;t recommend to all
People, to alter their manner of Life, to
Eat, <HI>but e&s;pecially to Drink</HI> more moderate|ly;
and in a Word, to LIVE TEMPE|RAIELY
and Sparing; to Eat le&s;s Fle&s;h,
le&s;s Sauce, and le&s;s of the half Dige&s;ted
Juices and Gravy of their Meats, which
a mo&s;t pernicious Cu&s;tom has enur'd
them to, by which they are brought to
Eat their Meat half Roa&s;ted and half
Boil'd.</P>
<P>It is a mo&s;t unaccountable Habit that
we are brought to by our vitiated Ap|peties
in this Nation, Namely, to Eat
our Fle&s;h Meat, of which al&s;o we feed
immoderately, almo&s;t Raw: Indeed &s;ome
People may be &s;aid to feed little diffe|rent
from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who Eat their
Hor&s;e-fle&s;h Raw, if we were but to be
&s;een by the People of any other Country
how we Eat, e&s;pecially our Wild Fowl, the
Fle&s;h &s;carce warm thro', and all the un|dige&s;ted
Impurities of the Entrails and
<PB N="45" REF="56">
In&s;ide of them &s;erving for our Sauce.
I &s;ay, when Strangers &s;ee us feeding thus,
they mu&s;t be allow'd to take us, as they
do, to be, if not Canibals, yet a &s;ort of
People that have a canine Appetite; and
it was the mode&s;te&s;t Thing I cou'd ex|pect
of them, when in Foreign Countries,
I have heard them de&s;cribe our way of
Feeding in <HI>England,</HI> and tell us that we
<HI>Devour</HI> our Meat, but do not Eat it;
<HI>viz.</HI> Devour it as the Bea&s;ts of Prey do
their Meat with the Blood running be|tween
our Teeth.</P>
<P>Let no Man flatter him&s;elf in his feed|ing
in this gro&s;s Manner, the Body &s;o
fed is prepared not again&s;t, but for a
Contagion; and we have much rea&s;on
to fear, that if we &s;hould now be vi&s;ited,
&s;uch a Vi&s;itation will find us half pre|par'd
for it to work upon, and con&s;e|quently
we &s;hall receive the Di&s;temper
with more Danger.</P>
<P>Some People tell us of the Plague
being propagated by In&s;ects, and the&s;e
carried from Place to Place in the Air,
in an unaccountable manner; which
if it were true, one Place would be ap|parently
Infected as well as any other
and at the &s;ame time, as Blites in our
Orchards, frequently run over the whole
Kingdom. I leave tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers to
<PB N="46" REF="57">
be confuted by the Phy&s;icians, who have
much better and more rational Accounts
to give of the beginning propagating
and &s;preading the Infection: But that
foul Bodies and gro&s;s Feeding make us
more receptible of Infection than we &s;hould
otherwi&s;e be, this &s;eems to be a Truth
that both Sides mu&s;t grant.</P>
<P>Temperate Diet, and avoiding Ex|ce&s;&s;es
in &s;trong Drink, which &s;o many
ways debauch not the Head only but
even the whole Con&s;titution, &s;hould be
avoided as carefully before the Plague,
I &s;ay as carefully as we would avoid Con|ver&s;ing
with an infected Body in the
time of the Plague.</P>
<P>If I can give any Credit to the A&s;&s;u|rances
of tho&s;e who lived in <HI>London,</HI> in
the Time of the la&s;t great Plague, few
of tho&s;e People we call <HI>Drunken Sots,</HI> e&s;|cap'd
the Di&s;temper; it is an odd way of
ob&s;erving on &s;uch things, and therefore
I de&s;ire to explain my &s;elf: By the Word
<HI>Drunken Sots.</HI> I mean a &s;ort of People,
who have by a Habit of Drinking to
Exce&s;s brought them&s;elves to Soti&s;m
that have debilitated them&s;elves, their
Bodies as well as their Under&s;tandings,
and are come to dozing over $heir Drink;
who make their Drink their Food, Eat
little, and Sip to keep their Spirits up;
<PB N="47" REF="58">
I need not de&s;cribe what I mean by a
Sot, but according to my Friend's Re|lation,
the&s;e Men all went off; &s;ome that
Drank hard, but had &s;trong Con&s;titutions
and that were not Conquer'd by their
Drink, tho' they were often Drunk, out
liv'd it, and had not the Di&s;temper, but
the other were generally carry'd off.</P>
<P>What I infer from this, is, that In|temperance
in Drinking, as it is de|&s;tructive
to the Con&s;titution, &s;o it is a
mo&s;t dreadful Induction to the Plague;
when the Spirits are attack'd by the
Venom of the Infection, they being al|ready
Exhau&s;ted, are in no Condition to
Defend the Body, and &s;o the Man dies
of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We make a great &s;tir, as I have &s;aid about
avoiding ill Smells in a time of Infection,
and<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Bradley <HI>in his Book call'd,</HI> the Plague of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> Con&s;ider'd.</NOTE> one tells us, weakly enough, that
the City of <HI>London,</HI> was &s;o clo&s;e Built
in the time of the Plague in 1665, that
the Air had not a free Cour&s;e, &s;ufficient
to Purify the Streets, al&s;o that the Streets
were not Pav'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which 'tis in&s;inuat|ed
added to the ill Smells which pro|pagated
the Di&s;temper, both which as
<PB N="48" REF="59">
they are but trifling in them&s;elves, &s;o,
they are really fal&s;e in Fact; for the
Streets of <HI>London</HI> were Pav'd then as
well as now, and the Streets that were
then, may be judg'd by the Breadth,
and Buildings of tho&s;e Streets which re|main
&s;till, where the Fire did not come,
and which, though they are not quite
&s;o open and wide as the New Buildings
are, yet are they far from being &s;o clo&s;e
as to affect the Health of the Clty: Be|&s;ides
the Weakne&s;s of his Inference is
Evident another way, (<HI>viz.</HI>) it is ap|parent
that the greate&s;t Rage of the
Infection at that time was in the Out-parts,
where the Buildings were the &s;ame as
they are now, as in the Pari&s;hes of
St. <HI>Giles in the Fields,</HI> St. <HI>Martins in the
Fields,</HI> St. <HI>Andrews Holbourn, &amp;c.</HI> on the
We&s;t Part of the Town; and in the Pa|ri&s;hes
of <HI>Cripplegate, Bi&s;hopsgate, Aldgate,
White-Chappel, Stepney, &amp;c.</HI> on the Ea&s;t and
North, in all which Parts the Neighbour|hood
of the Fields prevented all interrup|tion
of Air; whereas in the Clo&s;e built
City, as he calls it, they were Healthyer
than in any other Part.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> likewi&s;e oppo&s;es his private
Opinion again&s;t the common Experience
of the Town, in the late Plague 1665, and
again&s;t the Advice of all the Phy&s;icians
<PB N="49" REF="60">
that were then in practice, about keep|ing
Fires in the Hou&s;es and Streets at
that time, which was u&s;ed with very
good Succe&s;s; and it was found by Ex|perience,
that tho&s;e People who kept Fires
Night and Day in their Hou&s;es, were much
freer than others from the Infection; the
Heat of the Fire rarifying the Air, and di&s;&s;i|pating,
if not con&s;uming the infectious Va|pours
or Particles, call them which we
will, with which the Air on &s;uch Occa&s;i|ons
is &s;uppos'd to be fill'd.</P>
<P>It was on this account that the Ci|tizens,
by order of the Lord <HI>Mayor,</HI> and
the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> by advice of the College
of Phy&s;icians, kept great Fires Night
and Day at the Corners of the Streets, at
the Gate of the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and in other
publick Places; by which they believ'd at
lea&s;t the Pa&s;&s;ing and Re pa&s;&s;ing the princi|pal
Streets of the City, where the greate&s;t
Numbers of People came, was kept
whole&s;ome, or at lea&s;t more whole&s;ome
than other Places</P>
<P>The great Quantity of Coals burnt in
Publick and in Private on that Occa&s;ion,
may Confute that fooli&s;h A&s;tertion of the
Author above mention'd, fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> That
at that time Sea-Coal was hardly in U&s;e:
I think I need &s;ay no more of that ridi|culous
part, than to Quote a Para|graph
<PB N="50" REF="61">
out of his Book, every Branch of
which is contradicted by the Knowledge
and Experience of Thou&s;ands now living;
his Words are as follow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;<HI>London,</HI> at the time of the Plague, 1665
was, perhaps, as much grounded with
People as I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> to have
been when the Plague begun; the
Streets of <HI>London</HI> were, in the time of
the Pe&s;tilence, very narrow, and, as I
am inform'd, unpaved for the mo&s;t
part; the Hou&s;es by continued Jetts
one Story above another, made them
almo&s;t meet at the Garrets, &s;o that the
Air within the Streets was pent up,
and had not a due Freedom of Pa&s;&s;age,
to purify it &s;elf as it ought; the Food
of the People was then much le&s;s invi|gorating
than in the&s;e Days, Foreign
Drugs were but little in U&s;e, and e|ven
<HI>Canary</HI> Wine was the highe&s;t Cordi|al
the People would venture upon; for
Brandy, &s;ome Spices, and hot &s;pirituous
Liquors were then not in Fa&s;hion;
and at that time Sea Coal was hardly
in U&s;e, but their firing was of Wood;
and, for the mo&s;t part, Che&s;tnut, which
was then the chief Furniture of the
Woods about <HI>London,</HI> and in &s;uch Quan|tity,
that the greate&s;t Efforts were made
<PB N="51" REF="62">
by the Proprietors, to prevent the Im|portation
of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Coal, which they
repre&s;ented as an unwhole&s;ome Firing,
but I &s;uppo&s;e, principally, becau&s;e it
would hinder the Sale of their Wood;
for the generality of Men were (
imagine) as they are now, more for
their own Intere&s;t than for the Com|mon
Good.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Year 1665 was the la&s;t that we
can &s;ay the Plague raged in <HI>London,</HI>
which might happen from the De&s;tructi|on
of the City by Fire, the following Year
1666, and be&s;ides the De&s;troying the
Eggs, or Seeds, of tho&s;e poi&s;onous
Animals, that were then in the &s;tag|nating
Air, might likewi&s;e purify that
Air in &s;uch a Manner, as to make it
unfit for the Nouri&s;hment of others of
the &s;ame Kind, which were &s;wimming
or driving in the Circumambient Air:
And again, the Care that was taken to
enlarge the Streets at their Rebuild|ing,
and the keeping them clean after
they were rebuilt might greatly con|tribute
to pre&s;erve the Town from Pe|&s;tilence
ever &s;ince.&endq;</P>
<P>Nothing can be more contrary to Ex|perience
and the Truth of Fact, than this
whole Story together or apart, (1.) to &s;ay
<PB N="52" REF="63">
<HI>London</HI> was &s;upply'd with Wood for Fuel,
in the Year 1665, and that Coal was
hardly in u&s;e: Whereas in a very little
while after, we found the Parliament
thought 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per</HI> Chaldron upon Coals,
a &s;ufficient Tax for the rebuilding St.
<HI>Paul</HI>'s Cathedral, and all the Churches that
were lo&s;t by the Fire; and I appeal to
the Coal Meeters Books, which were
then &s;et up, for the quantity of Coals then
con&s;um'd in <HI>London</HI> and the Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>Then that the Woods about <HI>London,</HI>
were chiefly of <HI>Che&s;nut:</HI> That they were &s;o
about 300 Years before, I believe may be
true; but as the olde&s;t Man alive can|not
remember one Wood of <HI>Che&s;nut</HI> &s;tand|ing
near <HI>London</HI> or &s;o much as a <HI>Che&s;nut</HI>
Tree left among all the Woods near
<HI>London;</HI> 'tis &s;trange this Gentleman &s;hould
take upon him to write that, which &s;o
many People now alive can contradict.</P>
<P>Again, as to the Wines which People
then drank, this Gentleman is mo&s;t ri|diculou&s;ly
mi&s;taken; for when he gives
the Want of the u&s;e of Brandy, and hot
&s;pirituous Liquors for a Proof that the
Plague encrea&s;ed upon them, their Diet
not being &s;o invigorating as now; on the
contrary, I in&s;i&s;t that the Food of the People
was rather more invigorating than it is
now: For $s this Gentleman chiefly men|tions
<PB N="53" REF="64">
the Wines they drank. I oppo&s;e to it,
and appeal to the Knowledge of the whole
Town, that if they had not &s;o great a
variety of Wines to drink, they had no
adulterated Wines to Poi&s;on and Debauch
their Blood as we have.</P>
<P>If <HI>Canary</HI> was their highe&s;t Cordial, I
mu&s;t tell him, that they had then only the
be&s;t, mo&s;t generous and mo&s;t &s;anative
Wine in the World for their Cordial; and
well it were, if we their Self-wi&s;e Po&s;te|rity
had &s;uch Cordials as they had; that
is to &s;ay, that our <HI>Canary</HI> was only our Cor|dials,
and that our other Wines were not
adulterated and poi&s;on'd as they are, and
e&s;pecially con&s;idering that we do not drink
Wine now, by Drams, that is to &s;ay, by
&s;mall Quantities, and as Cordials, as they
did; but by Quarts and Gallons, that we
make our Phy&s;i$k our Food and drink
Di&s;ea&s;es upon our &s;elves which our An|ce&s;tors
at the late Plague knew nothing
of.</P>
<P>In like manner 'tis a mi&s;take to &s;ay,
that they had no Brandy or Cordials at
that time; the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e-Books a|bundantly
contradict it; and it is too re|cent
in our Memory, for any Man of
Years to forget, that the People had their
<HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and other Di&s;till'd Waters to
<PB N="54" REF="65">
drink as Cordials, on all occa&s;ions that
required Cordials.</P>
<P>But it is true, that there was not
Two Thou&s;and Brandy &s;hops, and Twelve
Hundred Punch Hou&s;es in <HI>London,</HI> as they
&s;ay there are now; and that the Spirits
which are now Di&s;till'd, (or rather half
drawn) from Malt and mu&s;ty Grounds,
are rather adapted to Poi&s;on and De&s;troy
Mankind, than to be Cordials to their
Blood.</P>
<P>It is out of que&s;tion that the People of
<HI>England,</HI> liv'd more regular, and if I may
judge of it, far'd better in tho&s;e Days by
far than they do now: What they Eat
and Drank then, was much more invi|gorating
than our way of living now is;
for this Gentleman, though a Member of
the <HI>Royal-Society,</HI> mu&s;t not tell us that In|temperance
is an invigorating way of li|ving;
drinking Wine as we drink Wine,
corrupted, adulterated and poi&s;on'd; drink|ing
Punch by Gallons, made of Malt
Spirits, &s;tinking, <HI>as I may ju&s;tly call it,</HI>
of the humid, and half drawn from the
half Brew'd Worts: Cou'd any Man of
common Sen&s;e in&s;tance the Temperate
living of tho&s;e Days, as a rea&s;on why the
Plague &s;pread with more Violence, and
then bring up the Drunken &s;ordid &s;wal|lowing
down foul Liquors, and gorging
<PB N="55" REF="66">
our&s;elves with Poi&s;on and Stench, as a
rea&s;on why we &s;hould bear it off better
than they?</P>
<P>On the contrary I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t, that
our Vices which are already a Plague
upon our Morals, are a dreadful kind of
Fuel for a Contagion, and mi&s;erably
prepare us for a Plague upon our Bodies:
As to the $$$vock they make of Con&s;ci|ence
and Religion, and the Ruin they are
to Souls, I refer that to its Place.</P>
<P>Our Fore-fathers had Sins enough no
doubt, and for which Heaven brought
Judgments upon them mo&s;t righteou&s;ly;
but our Fore-fathers never were guilty
of the Luxury that we practi&s;e, neither in
kind or in degree.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, the Author $word$ &s;peak|ing
of, &s;hould have gone a little $word$
back too, for the Deficiency in good Li|quors
which he mentions, than the Year
Sixty Five; for the Flux of Wine from
<HI>France,</HI> which began to &s;upply us, and the
Breach made on Peoples Morals by Ex|ce&s;&s;es,
were really begun &s;ometime before;
Namely, at the Re&s;toration of <HI>Civil Peace,</HI>
and the People were arriv'd to &s;ome degrees
of Proficiency in Debanchery by that time,
though not to the violent Height which
they are come to &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="67">
I bring it home to our pre&s;ent Ca&s;e
thus; if the Plague made &s;uch Progre&s;s
in tho&s;e days, when People liv'd in a
&s;o much more temperate manner than
they do now, how much more rea&s;on
have we to apprehend its Progre&s;s now,
when the Bodies of Men are debauch$d
with Exce&s;&s;es, in Meats and Drinks, and
all kinds of Intemperance? From the
whole, it is highly to the Purpo&s;e to pre&s;s
our People to u&s;e proper Remedies, to
clean&s;e their Bodies of all the Gro&s;s Exha|lations
and Nanceous Humours, which
fly up to the Brain from a foul Stomach
and from corrupted Juices in the Body; and
to &s;hew how much rea&s;on there is to change
our way of Living, and begin a tempe|rate
Cour&s;e of Diet, that Nature after
having had the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Medicine,
may be invigorated and &s;upported for the
Combat &s;he is to enter into.</P>
<P>I per&s;wade my &s;elf, that what I have
&s;aid here is &s;o ju&s;t and is &s;upported by
&s;uch Rea&s;ons as it will not be di&s;puted: I
cannot but think, that if the&s;e Things
were effectually con&s;ider'd and put in
Practice, the People of this City, wou'd
fare much better for it in a time of
Infection; and I am &s;ure they would have
particular Satisfaction in the Experiment.</P>

<HEAD>Family Preparations again&s;t the
PLAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>_I include the&s;e Preparations, under
the Head of Private, as oppos'd
to the Publick Preparations, I
&s;poke of in the fir&s;t General;
but they are a kind of Publick, as they
are different from the Preparations la&s;t
mention'd, which are Per&s;onal and Par|ticular.</P>
<P>I
mu&s;t for the &s;ake of this Head &s;up|po&s;e,
that the Plague (God forbid it)
was at the Door, or perhaps really be|gun
in the Nation: Next to the Phy|&s;icking
the Body, as I have &s;aid, and en|tring
into a regular and temperate Life,
it comes to be con&s;ider'd, How Fami|lies
are to manage them&s;elves, and in what
manner of Po&s;ture People &s;hould propo&s;e
to put them&s;elves, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent
the Contagion breaking in upon them.</P>
<P>The Pe&s;tilence, being as has been &s;aid,
a Contagious Di&s;temper, it is one of the
<PB N="58" REF="69">
fir&s;t Principles <HI>in the Argument now in
Hand,</HI> that every Family &s;hould keep
them&s;elves from Conver&s;ing with one
another, that is to &s;ay, from Conver&s;ing
with the Streets as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>When a Hou&s;e is Infected with the
Plague, <HI>we &s;hut it up;</HI> this was done in
the late Plague 1665 with great Severity;
the De&s;ign is to keep the common People
from conver&s;ing with the infected Fami|ly:
When a Hou&s;e is Sound and un in|fected,
<HI>they &s;hould &s;hut them&s;elves up,</HI> to keep
them from conver&s;ing with the com|mon
People, who perhaps may be in|fected:
The fir&s;t is done to keep the Fa|mily
from giving the Plague to the com|mon
People, the la&s;t &s;hould be done to
keep the common People from giving the
Plague to the Family; and the Rea&s;ons
are a ju&s;t Alternative, Nature dictates
the one as well as the other; and let
the Inconveniences be what they will,
it is certain the thing is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary,
and the Succe&s;s &s;o vi&s;ible and promi&s;ing,
that no Family can repent the De&s;ign
of doing it; many have repented &s;oreley
that they did not do it, or did not do it
in time.</P>
<P>Now 'tis no new thing to direct People
to keep as retir'd in their Hou&s;es as po&s;&s;i|ble
in a time of Infection; but the Ca&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="70">
is, that People will not con&s;ine them|&s;elves,
or will not put them&s;elves in a
condition to do it effectually; and I
mu&s;t add, that not to do it effectually,
that is &s;trictly, is not to do it at all:
Nay, not to do it &s;trictly is wor&s;e than
no$ to do it at all, as I &s;hall &s;how pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>I
know a Family at this time living
in <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> who having effectually lock'd
them&s;elves up within their own Hou&s;e,
and never convers'd with the People of
the Town, never had the Di&s;temper at
all; and yet <HI>Mar&s;eiles,</HI> if we may be|lieve
the Accounts we have &s;een from
thence, was in a far more violent man|ner
Infected, than ever the City of <HI>Lon|don</HI>
was.</P>
<P>If we may believe the Accounts from
<HI>Provence,</HI> their died in <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and the
Villages within a League of it, above Sixty
Thou&s;and People.</P>
<P>If we may believe the Bills of Morta|lity
publi&s;h'd in the City of <HI>London,</HI> for
the Year 1665, there died of the Plague
in <HI>London,</HI> and the Villages about it,
that is to &s;ay, within the Lines of Com|munication,
Sixty Eight Thou&s;and Five
Hundred Ninety Six in that Year, and
no more.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="71">
Now all People that know the two
Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> will ac|knowledge
there is no Compari&s;on in the
Dimen&s;ions, or in the Number of Inhabi|tants
between the one and the other: If there
died 60000 People in <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> it will be
granted that there died at lea&s;t two Thirds
of the People; for they who reckon 90000
People to have been in that City, for
the u&s;ual Number of Inhabitants, are, in
my Opinion, &s;ure to reckon enough:
Should the Plague then of 1665 have
&s;wept away in <HI>London,</HI> a Proportion to
what it did in <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> there mu&s;t have
died even then above Four Hundred
Thou&s;and People, which would have been
a Dreadful time indeed.</P>
<P>Again, the Ca&s;e in <HI>London</HI> was really
moderate, compar'd to that of <HI>Mar|&s;eilles;</HI>
for though it is true, there were
but few People &s;een in the Streets in <HI>London</HI>
in the Height of the Infection; yet on
the other Hand, the dead Bodies did
not lie unburied in the Streets in Heaps;
the Sick were not laid out in Blankets
and on Couches in the Streets, to Ex|pire
in the open Air; the poi&s;on'd Bed-Clothes
and Furniture in which the In|fected
had liv'd, and on which the mi&s;e|rable
Wretches had given up the Gho&s;t,
was not to be &s;een in <HI>London,</HI> lying out
<PB N="61" REF="72">
in the Streets and at the Doors, to be
trampled on as the People went along,
all which was the Ca&s;e at <HI>Mar&s;eilles;</HI> &s;o
that if the Particles of Infection were in
the Air, as &s;ome People &s;ugge&s;t, it was
next to impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape it there.</P>
<P>Now if the Family I &s;peak of, did e&s;|cape
the Infection in &s;uch a Place as
<HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and in &s;uch a time, and next
under God's Providence by the circum|&s;pection
they u&s;ed, with regard to con|ver&s;ing
with others, much more might it
be &s;o in the City of <HI>London,</HI> whatever
may happen; if the Di&s;temper be not &s;o
violent as to de&s;pi&s;e all Precaution, and
to Infect People that never come abroad.</P>
<P>It is true for a Family in <HI>London,</HI> to live
perfectly retir'd in time of a Vi&s;itation,
is &s;care practicable, nay, unle&s;s they are
&s;ufficiently &s;tor'd with Provi&s;ions of all
&s;orts for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, with Phy&s;ick,
Clothes, and all other Nece&s;&s;aries, it is
not po&s;&s;ible; and &s;or want of this, as well
at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> as at <HI>London,</HI> many Thou|&s;ands
of Familes were Infected, who might
other wi&s;e have been pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>In order to direct any particular Fa|mily,
who have Sub&s;tance to enable
them to &s;hut them&s;elves up in &s;o &s;trict
a manner as would be ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
for pre&s;erving them effectually from
Contagion, to be receiv'd from any other
<PB N="62" REF="73">
Per&s;on, or the Goods or Clothes of any
that are Infected, I &s;hall here de&s;cribe
a Family &s;o &s;hut up, with the Precau|tions
they u&s;ed, how they maintained
an ab&s;olute Retreat from the World,
and how far they provided for it; it be|ing
partly Hi&s;torical and partly for Di|rection;
by which Pattern, if any Family
upon the like occa&s;ion, thinks &s;it to act,
they may, I doubt not, with the Concur|rence
of Providence hope to be pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>THE FAMILY I &s;peak of, liv'd in the Pa|ri&s;h
of St. <HI>Albans Wood-&s;treet:</HI> They con|&s;i&s;ted
of the Ma&s;ter of the Family and his
Wife, being either of them between Forty
and Fifty Years of Age, the Man about
Eight and Forty, the Wife about Two
and Forty and in pretty good State of
Health; there were Five Children, Three
Daughters and Two Sons, Two Maid
Servants and an Apprentice; the Per&s;on
was a con&s;iderable Dealer, and by Trade
a Whole$$le Grocer: He had another
Apprentice near out of his Time; a
Porter and a Boy, who he kept all em|ploy'd
in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; but &s;eeing the
De&s;olation that was coming upon the
City, he dimi&s;s'd the Boy, gave him
&s;ufficient to carry him to his Friends
in <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> and made him go away
<PB N="63" REF="74">
directly with the Carrier; his Elde&s;t
Apprentice he gave the remainder of
his Time to, and he went away likwi&s;e
by Con&s;ent; as to the Porter, he did not
lodge in his Hou&s;e before, &s;o there was
no occa&s;ion of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him; but be|ing
a poor Man and likely to fall into
Di&s;tre&s;s for want of his Employ, he ob|lig'd
him to come evey day and &s;it at
the Door, from Nine in the Morning to
Six at Night as a Watchman, and to
receive any Orders, go of nece&s;&s;ary Er|rands,
carry Letters to and from the
Po&s;t-hou&s;e, and the like, and had a
Wicket made in the Door, to take in or
give out any thing they thought fit; be|&s;ides
which, there was a Rope fa&s;ten'd to
a little Pully, to draw up any thing from
the Streets, or let any thing down; by
this Rope they often let down Victuals
and Cordials, and what el&s;e they thought
fit to this poor Man the Porter, and
e&s;pecially his Wages con&s;tantly every
Week or oftner as he wanted it.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter having re&s;olv'd thus to &s;hut
him&s;elf up and all his Family; he fir&s;t
took Mea&s;ures for &s;toring him&s;elf with
all manner of Provi&s;ions for his Hou&s;e;
&s;o that if po&s;&s;ible he might not be under
a Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;end for any thing out of
Doors; re&s;olving to make it a &s;tanding
<PB N="64" REF="75">
Rule, that the Door &s;hould not be opened
upon any Account whatever, that the
deare&s;t Friend he had in the World &s;hould
not come in to him nor the greate&s;t
Nece&s;&s;ity in the World, Fire excepted,
oblige any one of his Hou&s;e to go out of
the Doors into the Streets; nor would he
&s;uffer any of his Family &s;o much as to
look out of a Window into the Street,
or open any Ca&s;ement, except a Wooden
Window made for the Purpo&s;e, where
the Pully and Rope was, and that up
two pair of Stairs; and this Wooden
Window, he caus'd to be cover'd with
thin Plates of <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Tin,</HI> that nothing
Infected or Infectious &s;hould &s;tick to it.</P>
<P>Whenever this Wooden Window was
open'd, he caus'd a Fla&s;h of Gun-powder
to be made in the Room, &s;o as to fill
it with Smoke, which as &s;oon as the
Window was open'd, would gu&s;h out with
&s;ome Force, &s;o that it carry'd away what
Air was at the Window, not &s;uffering
any to come in from abroad, till it was
purify'd and &s;ufficiently Sing'd with the
Sulphur that goes with the Gun-powder
Smoke.</P>
<P>While this Smoke la&s;ted, he that look'd
out of the Window talk'd with the Por|ter
at the Gate, let down to him or drew
up from him what he had occa&s;ion for;
<PB N="65" REF="76">
but if the Smoke of the Gun-powder
abated, he immediately &s;hut the Door
till he had made another Fla&s;h with
Powder within.</P>
<P>Before the time of &s;hutting him&s;elf
and Family in, and as &s;oon as he found
there would be a Nece&s;&s;ity of it, he
carefully furni&s;h'd him&s;elf with Stores of
all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions; but did it privately
and with as little noi&s;e as he cou'd; and his
Magazine was as follows, Fir&s;t as he
was Ten in Family, he allow'd them to
Eat a Pound of Bread each <HI>per</HI> Day;
but as he laid in a quantity of Meal be|&s;ides,
he abated one &s;ixth Part, for Cake
Bread, and &s;uch other &s;orts as might be
made in the Hou&s;e; &s;o he bought three
Thou&s;and Pound Weight of Bi&s;cuit Bread,
&s;uch a$ is B$k$d for Ships going to Sea,
and had it put up in Hog&s;heads as if
going to be &s;hipp'd off; &s;o that the Bi&s;|cuit-Baker
knew nothing but that it
was for a Ship that he was fitting out:
Then he caus'd it to be taken away in
a Boat, and bringing it up to <HI>Queen-Hi$$e,</HI>
landed it there and carry'd it by
Cart into his Warehou&s;e, as if it had
been Hog&s;heads of Grocery.</P>
<P>In like manner he caus'd Twenty Bar|rels
of Fine Flower, to be bought and
pack'd up, as they pack up fine Flower
<PB N="66" REF="77">
for <HI>Barbadoes</HI> or <HI>Jamaica:</HI> I mention this
becau&s;e it is known, that unle&s;s Flower
be thus pack'd up and pi$&s;s'd with great
A$t together in the C$sk, and then
Hearded clo&s;e up, &s;o that no Air can get
to it, it will Spoil, he Mu&s;ty, Breed the
Weavl$ and Corrupt.</P>
<P>$word$ he cau&s;ed a &s;mall Oven to be
$span$ $op of his Hou&s;e, that is
$span$ $ney in one of his $span$
laid in a$ many $span$
it, as would &s;erve
$span$ times in two Weeks,
$span$ Year.</P>
<P>$span$ twelve Hog&s;heads of
$span$ Beer, which he had cau&s;ed
to $span$ on purpo&s;e for keeping, be|ing
&s;o well Hopp'd that there was no
doubt o$ its being Sound; and having a
good Vault for keeping them, they were
&s;low'd by them&s;elves, and that the&s;e
might be &s;uppos'd to &s;upply him fully,
he had &s;ix half Hog&s;heads of other Beer
laid in for pre&s;ent u&s;e.</P>
<P>He took care for a rea&s;onable quanti|ty
of Wine, Cordial Waters and Brandy,
not for Mirth or plentiful Drinking, but
for nece&s;&s;ary Supplies, the Phy&s;icians al|&s;o
having advi&s;ed, every one that could
afford it, to drink moderately; &s;o as not
to &s;uffer their Spirits to &s;ink or be dejected,
<PB N="67" REF="78">
as on &s;uch melancholly Occa&s;ions they
might be &s;uppos'd to do.</P>
<P>To this end he bought a half Hog|&s;head
of the be&s;t <HI>Cana y Wine</HI> that he
could get in the whole City.</P>
<P>Two &s;mall C$sks of <HI>Ma$$$&s;ey,</HI> quantity
about 12 Gallons each.</P>
<P>One quarter Cask of <HI>Malaga S$$h.</HI></P>
<P>One &s;m$ll Run$$ of <HI>Tent or M$$$dine.</HI></P>
<P>Two &s;mall Run$$ of <HI>Aqua $word$.</HI></P>
<P>Twelve Gallons of <HI>Anni&s;eed Water.</HI></P>
<P>Two Runlets of Eight Gallons each of
<HI>Brandy,</HI> which was then very rare.</P>
<P>His Wife and Daughters had &s;t$r'd
their Clo&s;ets well with many $$rts of
Di&s;till'd Waters, as well Simple Waters
as others, and particularly a new C$$dial,
prepar'd by a Pre&s;cription of the Phy|&s;icians
at that time and call'd <HI>Plague-Water,</HI>
of this, though very Co&s;tly, they
had prepar'd the Quantity of Two dozen
Bottles.</P>
<P>Al&s;o his Wife and two Elde&s;t Daugh|ters,
had-&s;tored their Clo&s;et with &s;eve|ral
Preparations of Medicines, as directed
by the Phy&s;icians, as <HI>Mithridate, Venice|Treacle,
Dia&s;cordium,</HI> and <HI>Pill. Ruff. Lond.
Treacle, Diackylon, Turpentine,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="79">
Al&s;o they Collected all needful &s;orts
of Herbs and Roots, &s;uch as <HI>Rue, Mint,
Wormwood, Carduus, Angellica, Garlick,
Scabius, White-Lilly-Roots, Sage, Scrrel,</HI> and
other u&s;eful Simples, which they kept
dry, to u&s;e by the Pre&s;criptions of Me|dicine
publi&s;h'd by the College; &s;o that
they might make up the&s;e Things if
need was, without the help of an <HI>Apo|thecary</HI>
or <HI>Surgeon.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to Provi&s;ions,</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, like a pru|dent
Purveyor, took care to do every
thing without Clamour or Noi&s;e; &s;o that
he might not be known to lay in a great
Store of Provi&s;ions; the Danger of &s;uch
Things being made publick being often
great, and no doubt would have been &s;o,
had the City &s;uffer'd any &s;carcity of Pro|vi&s;ions,
which however, by the Prudence
of the Magi&s;trates was prevented; but
as that was more than he knew would
happen, he laid in all his Provi&s;ions with
the utmo&s;t privacy.</P>
<P>Having furni&s;h'd him&s;elf with Bread,
with Flower, and with Beer; in the next
Place he went to a Butcher in <HI>Rotherhith,</HI>
none having yet died of the Plague on that
Side of the Water; and here he caus'd
three Fat Bullocks to be kill'd, and the
<PB N="69" REF="80">
Fle&s;h Pickl'd and Barrel'd up, as if done
for a Ship going a long Voyage; like|wi&s;e
&s;ix Barrels of Pork for the &s;ame pre|tended
Occa&s;ions: The&s;e al&s;o he brought
by Water to <HI>Trigg-Stairs,</HI> where he Landed
them and Carted them to his Ware Hou&s;e
as before, as if it had been Grocery.</P>
<P>He then wrote to &s;everal Corre&s;pon|dents
he had in the Country, and caus'd
Twenty Flitches of Bacon to be &s;ent him,
&s;ome from one Place, &s;ome from another;
&s;o that they did not come to him al|together,
nor above two or three from
any particular Carrier.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e had a large Stock of Chee&s;es,
particularly out of <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Warwick|&s;hire</HI>
and <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> about Six Hundred
Weight in the Whole; he Bought al&s;o
five very large old <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;es; &s;o
that he had a Store of Chee&s;e for much
more than a Year.</P>
<P>Out of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> he had &s;ent him Twelve
Firkins of the be&s;t Salt Butter that cou'd
he had; be&s;ides that, he had &s;everal Pots
of Butter &s;ent him by particular Order
from other Countries where he had Deal|ings.</P>
<P>He
took particular Care to lay in a|bout
a Ton and a half of good White-Wine
Vinegar, as a thing that was par|ticularly
u&s;eful on many Occa&s;ions, he
<PB N="70" REF="81">
laid in a double or threefold Stock of
Coals and Wood for Firing, with Gun-powder
and Brim&s;tone for Scents as a|bove.</P>
<P>Al&s;o
Salt and Pickles in abundance, being
judg'd very whole&s;ome, with &s;ome Hams,
Neats-Tongucs, and Hung Beef for Dainties,
with about 20 &s;mall Jarrs or Stone Bot|tles
of good Oil, rather for Phy&s;ical U&s;es,
than for Salads, for the&s;e they were &s;ure
to be without.</P>
<P>Thus you have, as near as I can Col|lect
his Bill of Stores, and the Magazine
was certainly well fill'd.</P>
<P>It is true, every Family cou'd not do
thus; but 'tis al&s;o true, that if all tho&s;e
that could have done &s;o, had done it,
and had done it in time, the Contagion
had not &s;pread as it did into &s;o many
&s;ub&s;tantial Families; for tho' it was &s;aid,
<HI>which however I do not grant,</HI> that none of
the Market-people were Infected, who
carried Provi&s;ions to &s;upply the City;
yet this I can undertake to &s;ay, and cou'd
prove it by many People &s;till living, that
abundance of People got the Di&s;temper
by going to Market to Buy tho&s;e Provi|&s;ions;
that is to &s;ay, by going out into
the Street to fetch &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries as
they wanted, whether at Shops or in the
Markets; and therefore it was the mo&s;t
<PB N="71" REF="82">
nece&s;&s;ary Precaution that cou'd be taken
by this or any other Per&s;on, to lay in
a Fund of Provi&s;ions for his whole Fa|mily;
&s;o as not to be oblig$d to have
any Per&s;on go out of his Hou&s;e into the
Street, or into his Hou&s;e from the Street,
by which he was as much &s;eparated
from the People of the City, as if he had
liv'd &s;everal Miles off from them.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mention'd, that he took
care to have all other needful petty Things
provided; &s;uch as Shoes, Ho&s;e, Gloves,
and all &s;orts of Linnen and wearing
Clothes; &s;o that nothing cou'd be want|ed
that they need go out for, of that
Kind.</P>
<P>As to Spice and Fruit, and all &s;uch
Things, they had &s;ufficient in the Hou&s;e
by the means of their Trade as a Grocer;
and as to Perfumes of many Kinds, he
provided a great Quantity.</P>
<P>Candles, he laid in about 70 or 80
Dozen, that is to &s;ay, dozen Pound,
with a great many Bottles of <HI>Limon-Juice,</HI>
and <HI>Lime-Juice,</HI> tho&s;e Acids being very ne|ce&s;&s;ary
on that Occa&s;ion. He doubly &s;tor'd
the Hou&s;e, al&s;o with Ve&s;&s;els of all &s;orts;
&s;uch as Earthen-Ware, Gla&s;s-Ware,
and all &s;uch peri&s;hable Things.</P>
<P>He caus'd all the Rats and Mice in his
Hou&s;e, to be effectually Poi&s;on'd and
<PB N="72" REF="83">
De&s;troy'd, and all the Cats and Dogs, to
be Kill'd and Buried deep in the Ground
in his Yard.</P>
<P>He built up three great Terras Ci|&s;terns,
and had them kept con&s;tantly
fill'd with Water, that every Room in
his Hou&s;e might be frequently wa&s;hed,
and not content with the Water of the
<HI>New-River</HI> in his Yard, which came in
by a Pipe, he cau&s;ed a Well to be &s;unk
in his &s;aid Yard, and a Pump plac'd there,
that he might have Water to Dre&s;s their
Provi&s;ions with, which did not run open in
the City Air, or that cou'd be touch'd
with any dead Carca&s;s, or have any li|ving
Body or Clothes wa&s;h'd in it, which
were Infected with the Plague.</P>
<P>His la&s;t and greate&s;t Concern was for
fre&s;h Meat; and this he cou'd not con|trive
any way for; and therefore except|ing
that he made &s;ome Provi&s;ions of live
Fowls, which he cau&s;ed to be kept for
the &s;ake of having a few Eggs in the
Hou&s;e, and for now and then a Fowl to
Eat; he re&s;olv'd to be content without
either Mutton, Lamb or Veal; and this
was the greate&s;t Mortification they &s;uf|fer'd
as to Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Preparations, he began; he
forbore &s;hutting him&s;elf quite in for &s;e|veral
Months after the Plague was be|gun,
<PB N="73" REF="84">
and even till there died above 1000
a Week; becau&s;e that though the In|fection
was very Terrible in the Out Pa|ri&s;hes,
and e&s;pecially in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Part of
the Town, that is to &s;ay, in <HI>Holbourn,</HI>
St. <HI>Giles, Fleet-&s;treet,</HI> and the <HI>Strand;</HI> yet
the City was very Healthy, nor was the
Di&s;temper felt within the Walls to any
Degree, till the latter end of <HI>June</HI> or the
beginning of <HI>July,</HI> for in the &s;econd Week
in <HI>July,</HI> when there died, as by the Week|ly
Bills appeared, 1268 of all Di&s;tempers,
there yet died but 28 of the Plague, in
all the 97 Pari&s;hes within the Walls,
and but 16 in the whole Body of Build|ings
on the <HI>Surrey</HI> Side of the Water.</P>
<P>However, the next Week after it was
doubled again; and as he fore&s;aw the In|fection
o're&s;preading the whole City and
all the Out-parts, like a dreadful Torrent,
as he had always &s;aid it would do, he be|gan
to put his Re&s;olutions more &s;trictly in
Execution; for from the beginning of <HI>July,</HI>
he &s;uffer'd none of his Family to &s;tir
out without the Walls of the City, nor
in the City to any publick Place, Market,
Exchange, Church, or the like; and wrote
to all his Dealers and Corre&s;pondents in
the Country, not to write for any more
Goods, for that he could not &s;end any
<PB N="74" REF="85">
thing out into the Streets to the Carriers,
or receive any thing in from them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>July</HI> he begun to place his
Porter without the Door, where he built
him a little Hutch to &s;it in, and where he
(<HI>the Porter</HI>) receiv'd all Me&s;&s;ages and Errands,
and deliver'd them as he got admittance
at a Wicket in the Door; and gave &s;uch
An&s;wers again when call'd for, as he was
directed: By the 14th of <HI>July</HI> the Plague
was encrea&s;ed in a dreadful Manner in the
Out-parts, &s;o that the Bills amounted that
Week to 1762 of all Di&s;tempers, 1500
of which might be &s;uppos'd to die of the
Plague, and the Number &s;till encrea|&s;ing,
their own Pari&s;h being the &s;econd
that was Infected in the City. I &s;ay on
the 14th of <HI>July</HI> he &s;hut the Wicket of
his Door up, and Bolted, Barr'd and
Lock'd him&s;elf in with all his Hou&s;e,
taking the Keys into his own keeping,
declaring to all his Family, that if any
one of them, though it were his elde&s;t
Son or Daughter, &s;hould offer to &s;tir out
without the Door, though it was but a
Yard off, they &s;hould not come in again
upon any Terms what&s;oever.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time he Nail'd up all the
Ca&s;ements of his Windows, or fa&s;ten'd the
Wooden-&s;hutters on the in&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86">
N. B. <HI>They had no Sa&s;h Windows in tho&s;e
Days, nor for many Years after.</HI> This he
did becau&s;e it had been the Opinion of
&s;ome Phy&s;icians, that there was at lea&s;t
many unwhole&s;ome Steams and Infectious
Smells in the Air, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e
clo&s;e Streets, and among the Hou&s;es where
the Plague was already &s;pread; and it
was more than ordinarily ob&s;erved by
curious People, that in the Hou&s;es which
were Infected, and had been &s;hut up, and
where &s;everal Per&s;ons, or perhaps the
whole Family, had died, there was a
&s;trange Clamy or Dewy Sweat on the in|&s;ide
of the Gla&s;s of the Windows, like
the Sweat that will be on Windows in
a damp Morning; that this did not
melt off with the Heat of the Sun, as in
other Ca&s;es, but rather con&s;i&s;ted the
&s;tronger: That this was the poi&s;onous Air
breathed out of the infected People's Bo|dies
who had died of the Plague was not
doubted; but whether this was Infectious
in its Nature, and would if the Windows
had been opened have Infected the next
Hou&s;es, or the next People that had &s;uck'd
it in with their Breath; this I &s;ay, was
not determin'd, neither do I determine
it, tho' to me it &s;eems rea&s;onable that it
&s;hould do &s;o: However, this Prudent
Hou&s;eholder acting al&s;o by the Direction of
<PB N="76" REF="87">
good Phy&s;icians, clo&s;ed up all his Win|dows
as above, except the Wooden Shut|ter
kept open for Conver&s;ing with his
Porter without Doors, as above; he al&s;o
made Chimney-Boards, to clo&s;e up all
tho&s;e Chimneys in which he did not
keep con&s;tant Fires, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve
afterwards.</P>
<P>Till this time he had taken fre&s;h Meat
of a Country Woman, a Higgler, who a&s;|&s;uring
him &s;he brought it from <HI>Waltham-Abbey</HI>-Market,
and open'd it not till &s;he
came to his Door, he had &s;ome Satisfacti|on
in it; but now he forbid her al&s;o,
and allow'd her coming no more.</P>
<P>Now therefore he opened his Magazine,
and di&s;tributed Bread by Weight to his
Family: It was long e$re his Children could
be brought to eat the coar&s;e and hard
Sea-Bi&s;cuit-Bread, and he was fain to
di&s;tribute to them more Meal and fine
Flower than he purpo&s;ed at fir&s;t, and
they made them&s;elves Cakes and &s;mall
Loaves of Bread as they cou'd; but in a
little time they were us'd to the other, and
they found ways to &s;oak and &s;often them
by &s;uch mixtures as they cou'd get.</P>
<P>Being now entirely &s;hut up, they &s;carce
knew how it far'd with their Neighbours;
except that they heard the Knells con|tinually
Sounding; and their Porter gave
<PB N="77" REF="88">
them in Weekly the Bills of Mortallity,
where they might &s;ee what dreadful Havock
the infection made in the Town round a|bout
them.</P>
<P>After they had been &s;hut up about
three Weeks, their Porter gave them an
Account that the next Hou&s;e to them
but two was Infected; that three Hou&s;es
on the other Side of the Way were &s;hut
up, and that two Servants, out of ano|ther
Hou&s;e on the &s;ame Side of the Way
but on the other Side of their Hou&s;e, were
&s;ent away to the <HI>Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e</HI> beyond <HI>Old-Street.</HI></P>
<P>It
was ob&s;ervable, that it went hard|e&s;t
with the poor Servants of &s;uch Fa|milies,
becau&s;e of their being often oblig'd
to go out on Errands, to fetch Things
which the Families wanted to which they
belong'd; as particularly, to the Markets
and to the Apothecaries and Chandlers-Shops,
which latter were at that time
the principal Market for all Nece&s;&s;aries,
except in Fle&s;h meat, Fi&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It was a great Satisfaction to them,
that the People in the next Hou&s;e to
them on one Side, were all gone away
into the Country at the beginning of the
Vi&s;itation, and had left the Hou&s;e all
lock'd up, all the Windows barr'd on the
In&s;ide, and Boarded up on the Out-&s;ide,
<PB N="78" REF="89">
and had left the Charge of the Hou&s;e with
the Con&s;table and Watch.</P>
<P>The next Hou&s;es to them on the other
Side were all Inhabited and all Vi&s;ited,
and at length all &s;hut up, and in one or
more of them the whole Families peri&s;h|ed.</P>
<P>By
this time they heard a Bell go
ringing Nightly along the Streets,
but knew not what it meant, it not
being like the Sound of the ordinary
Bell man; and tho' they heard a Voice
with the Bell, yet as it did not go at fir&s;t
by their Door, &s;o th$$ cou'd not di&s;tin|gui&s;h
what it was they &s;aid; and as their
Porter did not fit at their Door in the
Night as he did in the Day, they cou'd
not enquire; but at length their Porter
inform'd them that the Numbers of People
that died were &s;o great in the Out-parts,
that it was impo&s;&s;ible to Bury them in
Form, or to provide Coffins for them,
no Body daring to come into the In|fected
Hou&s;es; and that therefore, the
<HI>Lord-Mayor</HI> and <HI>Aldermen,</HI> had order'd
Carts to go about with a Bell-man to
carry away the Dead Bodies; that this
had been done in the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Holbourn,</HI>
and St. <HI>Sepulchres, Cripple-gate,</HI> and other
large Pari&s;hes above a Fortnight; and
that they began now to come into the
<PB N="79" REF="90">
City, and that in particular to the Pari&s;h
of St. <HI>Olave Silver-&s;treet,</HI> which was very
Sickly, and that the Carts were come thi|ther
the Night before.</P>
<P>This was frightful enough, <HI>Silver-&s;treet</HI>
being al&s;o the next Pari&s;h to St. <HI>Albans,</HI>
only on the other &s;ide of the Way, and
the Di&s;temper rag'd violently in both;
&s;o that during that Fornight, which was
the middle of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> there died near
four&s;core in tho&s;e two &s;mall Pari&s;hes, and
&s;till Encrea&s;ing; the Rea&s;on of this might
be partly the Joining of both the&s;e Pari&s;hes
to the <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Side of the Wall, and
the Pari&s;h of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> was at that time
dreadfully Vi&s;ited, the Plague being come
down that way from St. <HI>Giles</HI> in the
Fields, where it began; and the Weight
of the Infection during the latter end of
<HI>Augu&s;t</HI> and the beginning of <HI>September,</HI>
lay chiefly on that Side the City; from
whence it went on to <HI>Bi&s;hopsgate</HI> and
<HI>Shoreditch,</HI> and <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> and &s;o to
<HI>Stepney,</HI> taking the City with it, which
was as it were carried down with the
Stream; for the Infection came, as we may
&s;ay, fir&s;t into the City at <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> and
&s;o &s;pread in a few Weeks quite over it.</P>
<P>At this time, <HI>viz.</HI> from the beginning
to the end of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> or the end of the
fir&s;t Week in <HI>September,</HI> there died from
<PB N="80" REF="91">
700 to 800, and almo&s;t 900 a Week in
<HI>Cripplegate</HI> Pari&s;h only; and then it was
that the Carts were employ'd in that
Pari&s;h, it was indeed impo&s;&s;ible to Bury &s;o
many in the ordinary way, for there
died four Thou&s;and People in five Weeks
time in that Pari&s;h; &s;o that neither cou'd
Coffins be made or Graves dug for them,
or even Church-yards be found to lay
them in, &s;o that they were fain to obtain
a Grant of a Piece of Land from the City
in <HI>Finsbury Fields</HI> adjoining to the Artillery
Ground, which was given them for a Bu|rying
Ground, and remains &s;o to this Day;
in which they dug va&s;t Pits, and threw the
Bodies into them Nightly by Cart-loads,
always covering tho&s;e with Earth in the
Morning, who were thrown in over Night,
and then next Night throwing in more
Bodies and more Earth, and &s;o on till the
Pit was fill'd; &s;o that as it was reported
by the Pari&s;h Officers, about 2200 Peo|ple
were thrown into one of tho&s;e Pits:
But this is a Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>All this while the Family continued
in Health, and the chearful Parent en|courag'd
them to hope for Pre&s;ervation
whatever might happen without Doors;
but when he had &s;uch bad News every
Day from without Doors, and that every
Night he heard the di&s;mal Bell with the
<PB N="81" REF="92">
Cart, and the Voice following it in a
mournful Tone, <HI>Bring out your Dead;
Bring out your Dead.</HI> It cou'd not but
make heavy Impre&s;&s;ions upon the Minds
of the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Fa|mily,
and they began to look upon one
another with &s;ad Hearts; believing they
were all but dead Corp&s;es, and that the
Vi&s;itation was &s;o appointed by Heaven,
as that it would &s;weep away the whole
Body of the Inhabitants, and that none
would be left alive.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s he prudently order'd
all his Family to lodge on the lower
Floor, that is to &s;ay, up one pair of
Stairs, and that as many of them to lie
&s;ingle as po&s;&s;ible; and had all the Rooms
above furni&s;hed with Beds to lay any of
the Family in that &s;hould be taken Sick;
&s;o that if any were taken Sick, they
were to be immediately remov'd into
&s;ome of tho&s;e upper Rooms, as to an In|firmary,
where they &s;hould be &s;epara|ted
entirely from the re&s;t of the Family,
and a Nur&s;e procur'd from abroad, to
tend them, and to be drawn up by the
Pully to the Wooden-Shutter, &s;o as not to
come through the Hou&s;e at all, or Con|ver&s;e
with any in the Family.</P>
<P>In ordering this, he appointed that
if he him&s;elf &s;hould be taken, he would
<PB N="82" REF="93">
go immediately into the Infirmary, and
be attended by a Nur&s;e as above; and
that none of his Children &s;hould be &s;uf|fer'd
to come up the Stairs or come near
him; and that if he &s;hould die, his Body
&s;hould be let down by the Pully al&s;o in|to
the Cart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o of the whole
Hou&s;e: Tho' his Wi&s;e a&s;&s;ur'd him, that
if he was taken Ill &s;he would go up into
the Infirmary and be &s;hut up with
him.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e this Gentleman to
have much more Prudence than Religion,
and much more care of his Body than of
his Soul, and &s;o of the re&s;t of his Fami|ly,
if he took no care all this while of his
Hou&s;e, as to their wor&s;hiping God; be plea|&s;ed
therefore to &s;uppo&s;e, That as he was a
&s;erious pious good Man, &s;o he carefully
maintain'd the Wor&s;hipping of God in his
Hou&s;e, that three times every Day he
call'd his Family together in the &s;olemne&s;t
Manner to read to them, and pray to
God with them, always committing them
with the utmo&s;t Affection and Humility
to the Divine Protection, and ca&s;ting
them&s;elves into the Arms of God's In|finite
Mercy. Twice every Week they
kept a &s;olemn Day, giving them&s;elves up
to God by Fa&s;ting and Prayer: Every
Night indeed, looking on them&s;elves as
<PB N="83" REF="94">
dead Bodies, they laid down with di&s;mal
Apprehen&s;ions; but were &s;till Comforted
with finding them&s;elves every Morning
pre&s;erv'd and in Health.</P>
<P>The careful Father was up every Morn|ing
the fir&s;t in the Hou&s;e, and went to
every Chamber Door, Servants as well as
Children, to ask them how they did;
and when they an&s;wer'd, Very well, left
them with that &s;hort return, <HI>Give God
Thanks.</HI> This he did, that if any had
been Ill, they might immediately have
been removed up Stairs, as is mention'd
above.</P>
<P>Hitherto he had corre&s;ponded with &s;e|veral
of his Acquaintances and Cu&s;tomers
in the Country, and had receiv'd Letters
from them, and written Letters to them
con&s;tantly; but would not do any Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
or &s;end any Goods to them upon
any Account, tho' very much pre&s;s'd to
it; becau&s;e he re&s;olv'd not to open his
Doors whatever Damages he &s;uffer'd.</P>
<P>His Letters were brought by the Po&s;t-Man,
or Letter-Carrier to his Porter, where
he caus d the Porter to Smoke them with
Brim&s;tone, and with Gun-powder, then
to open them, and then to &s;prinkle them
with Vinegar; then he had them drawn
up by the Pulley, then &s;moak'd again
with &s;trong Perfumes, and taking them
<PB N="84" REF="95">
with a pair of Hair Gloves, the Hair
outermo&s;t, he read them with a large
reading Gla&s;s, which read at a great
Di&s;tance&punc; and as &s;oon as they were read
burn'd them in the Fire; and at la&s;t the
Di&s;temper raging more and more, he
forbid his Friends writing to him at
all.</P>
<P>In the Height of this Calamity, and
when (as before) the good Man was almo&s;t
di&s;couraged, he was &s;till more &s;traightn'd
by the lo&s;s of his poor faithful Porter;
he mi&s;s'd him at the u&s;ual Time when he
was wont to lower down by the Pulley
a Me&s;s of Broth to him, or &s;ome other
thing warm for his Breakfa&s;t; but calling
to him he did not an&s;wer, which made
him afraid &s;omething was ami&s;s with him:
However, he heard nothing of him all
that Day or the next; when the third
Day calling again from within the Door
for him, they were an&s;wer'd by a &s;trange
Voice, who &s;poke in a melancholly Tone
that <HI>Abraham</HI> the Porter was dead? And
who then are you, &s;ay the Ma&s;ter to
the Per&s;on that &s;poke? I am his poor
di&s;tre&s;s'd Widow, Sir, &s;ays the An&s;werer,
come to tell you that your poor Servant is
gone? He was greatly afflicted at the lo&s;s
of &s;o u&s;eful and &s;o faithful a Per&s;on: How|ever,
he compos'd him&s;elf, Alas poor Wo|man,
<PB N="85" REF="96">
&s;ays he to her, and what can'&s;t thou
do then? O Sir, &s;ays &s;he, I am provided for,
I have the Di&s;temper upon me, I &s;hall
not be long after him?</P>
<P>He was perfectly a&s;toni&s;h'd and &s;ur|priz'd
at her la&s;t Words, and as he &s;aid,
it made his Heart cold within him:
However, as he &s;tood &s;urounded with the
Smoke of Gun-powder, and within the
Wooden-Shutter, he did not immediately
retire; but &s;aid to her again; if you are
in &s;uch a Condition good Woman why
did you come out? I came, &s;ays &s;he Sir,
becau&s;e I knew you would want poor <HI>A|braham</HI>
to wait at your Door, and I would
let you know: Well, but &s;ays he, if he
is dead, I mu&s;t want him, you cannot
help me that are in &s;uch a Condition as
you &s;peak of? No, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, I cannot
help you, but I have brought you an
Hone&s;t poor Man here that will &s;erve you
as hone&s;tly as poor <HI>Abraham</HI> did; that
is kindly done, &s;aid the Ma&s;ter; But how
do I know what he is, and as he comes
with you that are Sick, as you &s;ay, how
do I know that he is not Infected; I &s;hall
not dare to touch any thing that comes
from him? O Sir, &s;ays &s;he, he is one of
the <HI>&s;afe Men,</HI> for he has had the Di&s;tem|per,
and is recovered, &s;o he is out of
<PB N="86" REF="97">
Danger, or el&s;e I would not have brought
him to you: He will be very Hone&s;t.</P>
<P>This was an encouragement to him,
and he was very glad of the new Man;
but would not believe the Story of his
being recovered till he brought the Con|&s;table
of the Pari&s;h where he liv'd, and
another Per&s;on to Vouch for it; while
this was doing, the poor Woman after
&s;ome further Que&s;tions and &s;ome Money
thrown down to her for Relief, went away.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;ervable now, that whereas
they found, <HI>as is &s;aid above,</HI> that it was
very Melancholly at fir&s;t to hear &s;o many
Knells going continually, &s;o on a &s;udden,
they now ob&s;erv'd that there was not
one Knell to be heard; the Rea&s;on, as his
new Porter told him was, that the Num|ber
of tho&s;e that died was &s;o great, that
they had forbid the Bells Ringing for any
Body, and People were all fetch d away
by the Carts, Rich as well as Poor.</P>
<P>Many Thou&s;ands of People would now
have fled away if they could, but no
Body would let them pa&s;s, and the enclos'd
Family began to be in great Terror; for
the Hou&s;es were de&s;olated round about
them, the Numbers of People that died,
were &s;carce to be reckon'd up, the Bills
gave an Account of near 1500 a Week
within the Walls, notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="87" REF="98">
infinite Number of People that were gone
away into the Country, &s;o that it was
his (the Ma&s;ter's) Opinion, that there
would not one Soul remain in the whole
City, but that all would peri&s;h.</P>
<P>However, he conceal'd his Fears as well
as he was able; and continued as well his
care over his Family, at his earne&s;t Pray|ers
to God every Day, and as I may &s;ay,
every Hour for them.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this Mi&s;ery, and as
he began to be very well plea&s;ed and
much a&s;&s;i&s;ted with his new Porter, and
particularly in that he was one, that hav|ing
had the Di&s;temper, he concluded there
was no Danger of his having it again; I
&s;ay, in the mid&s;t of this he was &s;ur|priz'd
with a near Affliction, for call|ing
one Morning to his new Porter,
no Body an&s;wer d, he call'd &s;everal Times
again, and all that Day and the next he
heard nothing of him; but all the
Satisfaction he cou'd get, was from a
Watchman who &s;tood at the Door of a
Hou&s;e that was &s;hut up, for all &s;uch Hou&s;es
had <HI>Lord have Mercy,</HI> and <HI>a great Cro&s;s</HI>
&s;et on the Door, and a Watchman plac'd
without, to prevent any coming out or
going in: The Watchman hearing the
Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e call the Porter by
his Name, an&s;wer'd, and told him the
<PB N="88" REF="99">
poor Man that u&s;ed to &s;tand at the Door
was Sick of the Plague, and he &s;uppos'd
was Dead; the Ma&s;ter an&s;wer'd, I know
he was Sick that I had fir&s;t, and is Dead;
but this was another: Well Sir, &s;ays the
Watchman, but he may be Sick and
Dead too, I &s;uppo&s;e, as well as the fir&s;t:
No, no, &s;ays the Ma&s;ter, you mu&s;t mi&s;take,
you mean the fir&s;t; No, Sir, &s;ays the
Watchman, I knew your fir&s;t Man <HI>Abra|ham</HI>
was dead, but this Man was call'd
<HI>Thomas Molins,</HI> was he not? Yes, &s;ays the
Ma&s;ter, then it is he I mean, Sir, &s;ays the
Watchman: Why that cannot be, &s;ays
the Ma&s;ter, he had been ill of the Plague
before and was recover'd, and he cannot
have it again? Alas! Sir, &s;ays the Watch|man,
'tis that I &s;uppo&s;e makes you &s;o
hard to under&s;tand me; I know 'tis many
Peoples Opinion, that when any has had
it and recover they are &s;ecure; but I
a&s;&s;ure you it is a mi&s;take, for I have
been twice recover'd of it in the <HI>Pe&s;t|Hou&s;e,</HI>
and been well a Fortnight between
the whiles, and now I am abroad again;
but I don't think my &s;elf &s;afe at all by
that, for I know &s;everal that have had
it three or four Times, and &s;ome that
have recover'd three or four Times have
notwith&s;tanding died of it afterwards:
and is my Porter <HI>Molins</HI> &s;ick of it again,
<PB N="89" REF="100">
&s;ays the Ma&s;ter, Yes, Sir, &s;ays the
Watchman, I heard he was; but I will
acquaint you more particularly to Mor|row.</P>
<P>Accordingly
the next Day, he call'd to
the Watchman again, who told him that
he had enquired and found that poor
<HI>Molins</HI> the Porter was carried away by
the dead Carts, as they call'd them, the
Night before: He was &s;urpriz'd exceed|ingly
at this, and &s;hut the Wooden-Door
immediately without &s;peaking a Word
more to him; and going in &s;at him
down, griev'd mo&s;t heartily, and wept by
him&s;elf a great while, to think that two
poor Men had thus lo&s;t their Lives as it
were to pre&s;erve him.</P>
<P>After &s;ometime, he con&s;ider'd that there
was no room for him to be di&s;courag'd, &s;o
went to his Wife and took a large Gla&s;s
of <HI>Canary,</HI> which was his u&s;ual Cordial,
and putting as good a Countenance on
it as he cou'd, &s;aid nothing of the Death
of the poor Man to his Family; but
re&s;olv'd to remain quietly in the Condi|tion
he was in, and as it pleas'd God
that all his Hou&s;e continu'd in pretty
good Health, he con&s;ider'd that he had
great rea&s;on to be Comforted and thank|ful
for that; and not to have any Sorrows
for others to affect his Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="101">
In this po&s;ture he remain'd about a
Fortnight more, having no manner of
Corre&s;pondence with the Street, and he
had re&s;olv'd to have no more Porters;
&s;o he was perfectly without Intelligence,
except that &s;till he found the Watch|man
he had formerly talk'd with every
Day before the Door of the Hou&s;e as he
thought, where he was at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But after about a Fortnight, he grew
impatient with being &s;o entirely without
Intelligence, and &s;eeing none of the Week|ly
Bills, nor knowing or hering any
thing but the doleful Noi&s;e of the Dead
Cart, and the Bell; at the end, I &s;ay,
of the Fortnight he open'd his Wooden
Window, and call'd to the Watchman,
ask'd him how he did&punc; and how that
Hou&s;e did where he was plac'd, &s;uppo&s;ing
it the &s;ame where he was before? Alas!
Ma&s;ter, &s;ays the poor Man, the di&s;tre&s;s'd
Family are all dead and gone except the
Journeyman, and he is carried to the
<HI>Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e,</HI> and I am plac'd at Mr.&mdash;'<HI>s</HI>
at the next Door, and they have three
People Sick and one Dead.</P>
<P>He ask'd him then in General, how it
went in the City? He told him very
bad, that the la&s;t Weeks Bill was above
Eight Thou&s;and of all Di&s;tempers, that it
Decreas'd at the other end of the Town
<PB N="91" REF="102">
in St. <HI>Giles</HI> and in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> the People
being mo&s;t of them Dead or gone away;
but that it Increas'd dreadfully towards
<HI>Aldgate</HI> and <HI>Stepney,</HI> and al&s;o in <HI>Southwark,</HI>
where it had been more moderate before
than in any other part of the Town.</P>
<P>In a Word, this being the middle of
<HI>September,</HI> the Plague was now in its ut|mo&s;t
Fury and Rage, only that as above
it was abated in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> end of the
Town where it began; and as the poor
Man told him, it had Decrea&s;ed a
little in <HI>Cripple gate</HI> Pari&s;h, tho' there
&s;till died in that Pari&s;h, between Four
and Five Hundred a Week, and in the
Pari&s;h of <HI>Stepney</HI> above Eight Hundred a
Week.</P>
<P>It was heavy News to this poor Gentle|man,
to hear to what a dreadful Height
the Calamity was come; and yet it was
&s;ome Encouragement, that it begun to
go off to the <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> and that it had
Decrea&s;ed &s;o much in <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Pari&s;h,
and he fail'd not to let his Family know
it; but &s;till as the Hou&s;es on both Sides
of him, and almo&s;t the whole Row on
the Side over again&s;t him were Di&s;tem|pered,
and &s;ome whole Families Dead,
it was very terrible to them to think
how they yet liv'd in the mid&s;t of Death:</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="103">
His Family began now to be &s;orely
afflicted for want of Air for Breath, and
with continued Eating of Salt Meats, be|gan
to grow Scorbutick and out of Order;
he did what he could by de&s;iring them
&s;tir and be active and bu&s;y about Hou&s;e to
pre&s;erve Health but would by no means
&s;uffer any Window or Door to be o|pened;
but as the Weather began to be
cooler than it had been, he continued to
keep Fires in every Room on that Floor
where they lodg'd, and had two of his
Family, who by turns &s;at up half a Night,
and two more the other half of the Night,
every Night to keep the Fires in, and
watch the Hou&s;e for fear of Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>This Scorbutick $word$ Increa&s;ed pretty
much upon them but was greatly reliev'd
at la&s;t, by his accidental reading one Day
of People being Cur'd of the <HI>Scurvy</HI> at
our I&s;lands of <HI>Antegoa</HI> or <HI>Mevis,</HI> by cating
Green <HI>Limons,</HI> after a long becalm'd Voyage
from <HI>Guinea:</HI> Upon this he remember'd
that he had a Quantity of <HI>Lime-juice</HI> and
<HI>Limon-juice</HI> in the Hou&s;e, which he gave
plentifully about to the Family, as often
as they would drink it, and in about a
Week or Ten Days time, they found
them&s;elves &s;en&s;ibly better'd by the tak|ing
it.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="104">
The Streets were now a melancholly
Sight to look into, the Pavement was
overgrown with Gra&s;s; it was not one
time in Twenty that they look'd thro'
the Gla&s;s, <HI>for they never open'd any Ca&s;e|ment,</HI>
that they could &s;ee any Body going
along, or &s;o much as a Door open; as
for the Shops they were all &s;hut clo&s;e,
except that the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> and <HI>Chandlers|&s;hops,</HI>
kept a Door open for the letting
People come for what they wanted; not
a Coach or a Cart to be &s;een, exeept
now and then a Coach carrying a Sick
Body to the <HI>Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e;</HI> and every Night
three or four Times a Night, the Dead
Cart, with the Bell-man crying, <HI>Bring out
your Dead?</HI></P>
<P>The poor Man was now &s;o Impatient
for want of his Porter, that he cou'd not
content him&s;elf without opening his
Wooden Window two or three Times
after this, to talk with the Watchman,
who continu'd po&s;ted at the Door of the
Hou&s;e that was &s;hut up, and to inform
him&s;elf how things went; but at la&s;t he
look'd for him and found he was gone too,
which was a great Lo&s;s to him, and he
was the more troubl'd, becau&s;e he in|tended
to have given him &s;ome Money.</P>
<P>But one Day as he was looking thro'
the Gla&s;s, he &s;pied the Man &s;tanding
<PB N="94" REF="105">
on the other Side of the Street, and look|ing
up towards his Hou&s;e, upon which
he ran immediately to his Wooden Win|dow,
and open'd it, tho' not forgetting
to make the u&s;ual Smoke with Gun|powder
for his Pre&s;ervation; when he
had opened the Door, the poor Watch|man
told him he was glad to &s;ee him
&s;till alive, and that he had come twice
before in hopes to &s;ee him, but was a|fraid
he had not been well; that he came
to tell him, that he was di&s;mi&s;s'd from
the Hou&s;e he was &s;et to Watch, mo&s;t
of the poor People being Dead, and that if
he plea&s;ed to accept of it, he would &s;it
at his Door in the Day time, as his two
Porters had done.</P>
<P>He was glad of his Offer, for he had
not been ca&s;y for &s;ome time with being
without, &s;o he an&s;wer'd him, that he
was glad to &s;ee him again, that he might
give him &s;omething for what he had done
for him, in telling him how things were;
&s;o he threw the poor Man two Crowns,
for which he was very thankful; after
which he accepted his Offer, and he took
his po&s;t at the Door as the others had
done before, but he would not let him
go to the Po&s;t-hou&s;e at all, or to any o|ther
Place, only to give him Intelligence of
Things as he heard them among his Neigh|bours.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="106">
He had not been at the Door many
Days, but he call'd to his Ma&s;ter, and
told him that he was glad to give him
the good News that the Infection abated,
and that the <HI>Weekly-Bill</HI> was now Decrea|&s;ed
1837 in one Week, which had of a &s;ud|den
given a great deal of Joy among the
People; that the Burials in <HI>Cripplegate</HI>
Pari&s;h were &s;unk to within 200, tho'
in <HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h they were &s;till as high
as ever, being between Eight and Nine
Hundred</P>
<P>He fail'd not to run to his Wife and
Family with this good News, but was
fain to moderate it too, for that his
Sons began to be impatient to go abroad,
which however, he was re&s;olv'd not to
&s;uffer. This was about the la&s;t Week
in <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>The next Week his New Porter gave
him Notice that the Plague continu'd to
abate, that the <HI>Bill of Mortallity,</HI> was a|gain
Decrea&s;ed between Six and Seven
Hundred more, though they were yet
at a frightful Height, being 5725 in a
Week, of all Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>However, it was a comfortable Thing
to think that the Violence of the Di|&s;temper
began to a&s;&s;wage; and more e&s;|pecially,
that it abated in that part of
the City, for in this la&s;t Bill, the Burials in
<PB N="96" REF="107">
<HI>Cripplegate</HI> Pari&s;h of all Di&s;tempers, came
to but 196, which was but a very few
compar'd to 886 a Week, which had died
there a few Weeks before; So that the
Plague was as much ceas'd to them as
it would have been to the whole City,
if there had not died above 1000 or
1200 <HI>per</HI> VVeek.</P>
<P>His Sons would fain have had him now$
like <HI>Noah,</HI> have &s;ent out a <HI>Dove,</HI> that
is, to have let them have gone out of
Doors to have &s;een how Things were,
and how the City look'd; and they urg'd
him the more, becau&s;e they began to
hear a Noi&s;e of People in the Streets
pa&s;&s;ing to and fro, and that pretty of|ten;
but he kept his Guard, and would
not let any one &s;tir out on any Terms,
or on any pretence what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The next VVeek but two, which was the
third in <HI>October,</HI> there was another great
Decrea&s;e of 1849 in one <HI>Bill;</HI> and now his
Porter knock'd at his Door, they did
not open either Door or VVicket, but
&s;poke to him, and he told them, he de|&s;ir'd
to &s;peak with his Ma&s;ter, to tell
him &s;ome good News: The Ma&s;ter of
the Family &s;oon appear'd at his u&s;ual
Wooden Window with one of his Sons
and one of his Daughters, the Watch|man
told him, that now he hop'd he
<PB N="97" REF="108">
could a&s;&s;ure him, that the Vi&s;itation
was really going off; that there had died
1849 le&s;s the la&s;t Week than the Week
before, and that the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> had or|der'd
the Carts to cea&s;e going about, ex|cept
twice a Week in &s;everal Parts of
the City, and in others but once each
Night; and that there had died but 88
in <HI>Cripple gate</HI> Pari&s;h that Week of all
Di$a&s;$s; that indeed it continu'd very
high in <HI>Stepney,</HI> and e&s;pecially in <HI>South|wark;</HI>
but that in the City it was ex|treamly
abated.</P>
<P>He let down to the poor Man, for his
good News, a Pint Bottle of good <HI>Sack,</HI>
and a &s;mall Basket with Provi&s;ions or
him and his Family. And now they
turn'd their two Days of Fa&s;ting, which
they had con&s;tantly kept in the Family
every Week, into one Day of Fa&s;ting,
and one Day of Thank giving, when on
the &s;udden, to the great Surprize of
the whole Family, the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf,
who was the Life and Spring of all the
Re&s;t, and of all the Management, which
under God, had &s;o evidently pre&s;erv'd
them, I &s;ay the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf was taken
very Sick.</P>
<P>It is not for me at this Di&s;tance, to
de&s;crible the terrible Con&s;ternation they
were all in; not only the whole Family,
<PB N="98" REF="109">
but the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf concluded he
was &s;truck with the Plague; and the
Apprehen&s;ion, lea&s;t he &s;hould be the
means to give it to any of his Children,
he would oblige them to have him car|ry'd
out to the <HI>Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e;</HI> his Wife and
all the Children declar'd again&s;t it, and
prote&s;ted to him every one of them, that
they would rather have the Di&s;temper
with him, and l$ave the Con&s;equence to
God's Mercy.</P>
<P>With the&s;e importunities he was pre|vai'ld
with, but order'd a Bed to be
made immediately in one of the upper
Rooms, mention'd before, and went pre|&s;ently
to Bed; taking &s;uch Things as
were pre&s;crib'd publickly by the <HI>College</HI> of
<HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> to be given at any ones being
fir&s;t taken with the Plague, which was
to provoke Sweat; upon taking the&s;e
Things he fell into a violent Sweat im|mediately,
and continu'd &s;o all Night:
Any one may &s;uppo&s;e the Family had but
little Sleep that Night; being in the ut|mo&s;t
Concern for &s;o careful and &s;o kind
a Father, as al&s;o very anxious to know
whether their Father had the Di&s;temper
or no.</P>
<P>No more can I repre&s;ent lively enough
the Joy there was in the Hou&s;e, when
the next Day they found their Father
<PB N="99" REF="110">
had Sweated very violently, fallen into
a good Sleep after it, and was &s;o much
refre&s;h'd and &s;o well, as to &s;atisfy them
all, that his Di&s;temper was not at all
Infectious; but that it rather proceeded
from the great Weight and Pre&s;&s;ure of his
Cares, which had been too heavy for
his Spirits, and withal, having taken &s;ome
Cold as they thought, by &s;tanding too
long talking at the Wooden Window
to his Watchman.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Sweating had reliev'd him
effectually, and in two or three Days he
was about Hou&s;e again and tolerably well,
tho' weak by Sweating a little too much.</P>
<P>While the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e lay
thus, the Family had no Joy of the De|crea&s;e
of the Plague; for what was the
Decrea&s;e to them if it broke out now
in their own Hou&s;e? but as &s;oon as the
Ma&s;ter recover'd a little, then they began
to look abroad again for Intelligence:
And now they cou'd &s;ee through their
Windows a new Countenance of things in
the Streets and upon the Hou&s;es; that the
People began to go up and down the
Streets very frequently; and &s;ome be|gan
to open their Shops, at lea&s;t to o|pen
them half way; the <HI>Hackney-Coaches</HI>
al&s;o were heard rumbling in the Streets,
&s;o that without calling to the Porter,
<PB N="100" REF="111">
they cou'd ea&s;ily perceive that the Di|&s;temper
was greatly Decrea&s;ed and that
the People that were left, bad more
Courage than before, and in a word that
the Plague was going off, at lea&s;t in the
City, and <HI>Chie&s;ly</HI> on that Side where
they liv'd.</P>
<P>Their Porter or Watchman confirm'd
it to them the next Day, when the <HI>Week|ly
Bill</HI> came about, which he brought
to them: The Ma&s;ter contented him&s;elf
with hearing $ow it was, but would not
let the Bill be taken in&punc; nor would he
yet abate one tittle of his &s;trict Guarding
his Family from Conver&s;ing with the
Streets by any means.</P>
<P>It was now the la&s;t Week in <HI>October,</HI>
and &s;o greatly was the Plague Decrea|&s;ed,
that there was but 22 Buried of it
in all <HI>Cripple-gate</HI> Pari&s;h, and but 20 the
Week before, which was almo&s;t as &s;urpriz|ing
as the great ri&s;e of it at fir&s;t; t$o'
even this Week the <HI>Bills</HI> were high in
<HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h and in <HI>Southwark</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>Now though this was joyful News to
this, as well as to other Families, yet
he was as anxious about the Danger of
opening his Doors too &s;oon, as he was
before of keeping them open at fir&s;t too
long: He was a ware that People would
$he ra&s;h in their Joy, and that preluming
<PB N="101" REF="112">
on the Health of the City being re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd,
they would return to their Hou&s;es
and bring out their Goods, on which o|thers
had died and air them, too &s;oon,
and &s;o perhaps bring back the Infections:
And it was ju&s;t as he had &s;aid, for about
the middle of <HI>November,</HI> the <HI>Bills</HI> on a
&s;udden Increa&s;ed 400 at once, and ro&s;e
from a Thou&s;and to Fourteen Hundred,
and the City was in a terrible Fright
upon that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But it pleas'd God that it went off a|gain,
and the Weather coming in Cool,
the Di&s;temper abated again, and the <HI>Bills</HI>
continu'd Decrea&s;ing till in the third Week
of <HI>November</HI> they were once more under
a Thou&s;and a Week of all Di&s;tempers,
where of but 652 of the Plague.</P>
<P>It is true, that con&s;idering the Number
of People who were dead, which was very
near an Hundred Thou&s;and, and the
great Number &s;led away, which accord|ing
to the mo&s;t moderate Gue&s;s, was at|lea&s;t
three times as many; con&s;idering the
Numbers who had had the Di&s;temper and
were recover'd, who though, <HI>as was Evi|dent
in the Ca&s;e of the Second Porter,</HI> they
were not entirely free from the return
of the Di&s;temper, yet were not &s;o very
ea&s;i'y Infected as others. I &s;ay, con&s;ider|ing
this, the dying of 652 a Week now,
<PB N="102" REF="113">
was as much as the dying of 2000 a
Week, was at the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI>
and this made him continue his Caution
with the &s;ame Rigour as ever, and in|deed
with rather more; for he remem|ber'd
well what a Con&s;ternation the Peo|ple
were every where in, when the Plague
was &s;o increa&s;ed, as to die from Eight
Hundred to a Thou&s;and a Week of all
Di&s;tempers, and even this Week I now
&s;peak of, which was from the 14th of
<HI>November,</HI> to the 21&s;t, the <HI>Bill</HI> &s;tood at
905, whereof 652 of the Plague.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there died in the City of
the Plague that very Week above twice
the Number as did in the Week from
21&s;t to the 28th of <HI>July,</HI> when the <HI>Bill</HI>
was 1761 in all; for then there died but
56 in all the City within the Walls,
whereas now there died 127, I mean of
the Plague: So that the City was not
&s;o Healthy then as the Out-parts: <HI>For
Example,</HI> The great Pari&s;h of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI>
was &s;o &s;trangely re&s;tored, that there died
in the Week from the 21&s;t to the 28th
of <HI>November,</HI> no more than 10 Perions
in all, and but two of them of the Plague;
which perhaps was the lea&s;t Number that
has been known in that Pari&s;h before
or &s;ince, for above an Hundred Years.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="114">
All the&s;e Things he Calculated exactly,
and as he &s;aid, was very loth to lo&s;e all
the Fruit of his Care and Caution; and
of the clo&s;e Confinement he had &s;ubmit|ted
to: I &s;ay he was very loth to lo&s;e it
all at once, by a ra&s;h and needle&s;s Ad|venture:
His Rea&s;ons were &s;o good,
and their own Safety &s;o much concern'd
in it, that his Family &s;ubmitted to it
with the more Chearfulne&s;s, though they
began to labour hard for Breath at that
time, and to be very de&s;irous of Air,
having been &s;hut up &s;o clo&s;e and &s;o long
as above.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>December,</HI> like <HI>Noah,</HI> who
opened the Window of the Ark&punc; to &s;end
out his <HI>Dove,</HI> he opened his Street Door
for the fir&s;t time and walk'd out: The
<HI>Bill</HI> of <HI>Montality</HI> the Week be$ore was 544
of all Di&s;ea&s;es, whereof only 333 of the
Plague, where of near half of that Num|ber
were out of <HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h, and the
<HI>Southwark</HI> Side of the River where the
Sickne&s;s continued longe&s;t, and was
longe&s;t before it began.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>December,</HI> I &s;ay he walk'd
out, but &s;uffer'd none of his Family to
&s;tir but him&s;el$; he view'd the Streets,
the Hou&s;es and Shops, but convers'd with
no Body, nor did he &s;ee any Body that
he knew, except a few ju&s;t in his own
<PB N="104" REF="115">
Neighbourhood; a va&s;t Number of Hou&s;es
were &s;tanding empty and de&s;erted, the
Inhabitants being gone into the Country;
yet in &s;ome of tho&s;e he ob&s;erv'd Servants
return'd, who had opened the Windows
and Doors, and were, as we call it, Airing
the Hou&s;es and the Goods, making Fires
in all the Rooms, opening the Windows,
and burning Per&s;umes in the Rooms, pre|paring
them in that manner for the
Return of the Families that belong'd to
them.</P>
<P>The Numbers of People in the Streets
were greater indeed than he expected;
but this &s;eem'd to be occa&s;ion'd rather
by the Curio&s;ity of the People, which
were left, which led them to go more a|broad
than otherwi&s;e they wou'd have
done, for in the Back-&s;treets and Ways,
le&s;s frequented, he found very few Peo|ple.</P>
<P>He came home again in a few Hours,
not having vi&s;ited any Body, or 'm$ de any
Enquiries after any of his Friends, or
any one el&s;e; and re&s;olv'd to keep up to
his Clo&s;e Quarters one Week longer; nor
would he buy any fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, or
&s;uffer any one to go to Market; but
re&s;olv'd upon &s;ome new Mea&s;ures which
he put in Practice the Week following. He
went out early in the Morning and taking
<PB N="105" REF="116">
his Elde&s;t Son and his Apprentice with
him, they walk'd on Foot as &s;ar as <HI>Totten|ham-High-Cro&s;s,</HI>
and finding a Hou&s;e there
of one of his Acquaintance, which had
not been Infected at all, he took Lodg|ings
or Apartments in it for his whole
Family, and the &s;ame Day return'd to
<HI>London:</HI> The &s;ame Week he remov'd them
all thither, carrying his own Goods and
&s;ome part of his own Provi&s;ions; all which
he cau&s;ed to be fetch'd by Waggons
belonging to the Country People, and
&s;uch as he had good Information were
Sound, and had not been Infected at all.</P>
<P>Here he not only reliev'd his Fa|mily
with fre&s;h Air, which they &s;o much
wanted, but with fre&s;h Provi&s;ions al&s;o,
which he had now brought to them from
<HI>Waltham Market,</HI> by his old Higgler who
had &s;upply'd the Family at the begin|ning
of the Year.</P>
<P>He left his Hou&s;e at <HI>London</HI> $a&s;t lock'd
up, except the Gate into his Yard, the
Key of which he gave to the Hone&s;t
Watchman, and went him&s;elf, or his Son,
or his Apprentice, two or three times a
Week, to &s;ee that every thing was &s;afe
and in good order: And thus he con|tinu'd
till the <HI>February</HI> following; for all the
Month of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January</HI> the Plague
continued in the City, and at the latter
<PB N="106" REF="117">
end of <HI>December</HI> it began to Increa&s;e again$$
which was believ'd to be by the People's
returning fa&s;ter than ordinary to their
Dwellings; &s;o that the third Week in
<HI>December,</HI> the Number Encrea&s;ed was 83,
and then there died of the Plague &s;till
281, the whole Bill being 525.</P>
<P>But by the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> the
Family being well recover'd and re|fre&s;h'd,
and all in perfect Health, and
the City being fill'd again with People,
and in pretty good State of Health, he
remov'd all back again, and came to his
Hou&s;e, open'd his Doors, and carry'd
on his Bu&s;ine&s;s as before.</P>
<P>Thus, next, under the Protection of
God's Providence, a compleat Retirement
from the Street and from Conver&s;ing on
any account whatever with the re&s;t of
the People &s;eparating from them, and
having, <HI>as we may &s;ay,</HI> nothing to do with
them neither to Buy or Sell, or &s;peak
or &s;it with or near them, has been ap|prov'd
to be capable of effectually pre|&s;erving
a Man or a Family, in the
Time of an Infection.</P>
<P>I will not &s;uppo&s;e this Man or his
Family, who were &s;o &s;evere in Fa&s;ting
and Humbling them&s;elves before God,
all the time they were under Appre|$en&s;ions
of the Di&s;temper, and &s;urround|ed
<PB N="107" REF="118">
with daily Experience of the dread|ful
Calamity that lay upon the City,
cou'd &s;o far forget them&s;elves now, as
not to give God Thanks in the mo&s;t
&s;olemn Manner po&s;&s;ible for their Deli|verance:
That part I take for granted;
they cou'd not be rational Creatures any
more than Chri&s;tians, and retain no &s;en&s;e
of &s;o &s;ignal Pre&s;ervation. I will therefore, I
&s;ay, take that for granted, and &s;ugge&s;t, that
the Ma&s;ter of the Family with the ut|mo&s;t
Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Devotion perform'd
this part, and that he oblig'd all his Fa|mily
to do the like.</P>
<P>Here is now a perfect Rule for any
one to walk by, and to pre&s;erve them|&s;elves
again&s;t the mo&s;t violent Infection
that ever yet happen'd in this Nation,
for &s;uch I e&s;teem that plague to be: And
I judge it by this, that although we call
it a Plague Year, and that the Number
of Per&s;ons that died, is accounted to the
whole Year, that is, from the 20th of
<HI>December,</HI> 1664, to the 20th of <HI>December</HI>
1665; yet the gro&s;s part of the Number
peri&s;h'd within the Compa&s;s of le&s;s than
four Months: Namely, from the 18th
of <HI>July</HI> to the 14th of <HI>November,</HI> in which
time there died 81559 People of all Di|&s;tempers;
whereas the whole Number in
the Twelve Months as by the Yearly Bills
<PB N="108" REF="119">
amounts to but 97306: Or take it of the
Numbers reckon'd to die of the Plague
and brought in &s;o by the <HI>Bill of Morta$|lity,</HI>
the whole Number that died of the
Plague in the Year, from the 20th of <HI>De|cember</HI>
1664 to the 19th of <HI>December</HI> 1665
was 68596, whereof there died in the
Compa&s;s of the 4 Months above men|tioned,
from the 18th of <HI>July</HI> to the 14th
of <HI>November,</HI> 65045: So that in the whole
&s;even Months of <HI>January, February, March,
April, May, June,</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> and half
<HI>July</HI> and half <HI>November,</HI> their died of the
Plague 3551 and no more.</P>
<P>Again in Nine Weeks of the&s;e four
Months, the Violence of this Contagion
was indeed mo&s;t dreadful, and beyond all
that ever was before in this Nation:
<HI>For Example,</HI> From the 8th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to
the 10th of <HI>October,</HI> there was Burned
60410 Per&s;ons, an incredible Number$
if we con&s;ider, that by the Judgment of
all that have been &s;eriou$ly inqui&s;itive in
that Matter, the <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Mortallity</HI> neither
did, nor was it po&s;&s;ible as Circum&s;tances
were then known to be, that they &s;hou$d
give a full Account of the Numbers of
People that peri&s;h'd in that dreadful
Calamity: Many peri&s;h'd in the Pields
and High-ways, wandering in their Di&s;tre&s;s,
and De&s;peration from the Town, de&s;olate
<PB N="109" REF="120">
and not knowing whither to go; the
Villages adjacent al&s;o refu&s;ing to &s;uffer
them to come in, or to give them any
&s;helter, Thou&s;ands peri&s;h'd in tho&s;e
Towns adjacent to <HI>London,</HI> which are
not included in the <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Mortallity;</HI>
which were notwith&s;tanding Crowded
with People who fled thither from <HI>London</HI>
in the beginning of the Infection, expect|ing
Safety there; which however, the
Di&s;temper being &s;o violent, was little
Protection to them, and they rather a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
to make tho&s;e Towns more un|healthy
than they would perhaps have
otherwi&s;e been: The&s;e Towns are &s;aid to

Yet in this dreadful Vi&s;itation, a re|treat
has been effectual in the very City,
and doubtle&s;s would &s;till be &s;o, if manag'd
with the &s;ame Prudence at another time.</P>
<P>Here is the Example: The Pattern
contains compleat Directions: And I
cannot doubt, but if the &s;ame method
were taken by any Family, the &s;ame Se|curity
would, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, be
obtained.</P>
<P>I am to ob&s;erve, that whereas this
Gentleman laid in a Magazine of Stores
&s;ufficient for his Family: I mean of Pro|vi&s;ions
for a whole Year; &s;o as he was
not &s;hut up above &s;even Months or
thereabouts, he had a great quantity of
Bi&s;cuit, Beer, Chee&s;e, Beef and other things
remaining.</P>
<P>If his Stores were &s;hort in any thing,
it was in fine Flower, and Butter; but
the Rea&s;on was not, that he had not
duly proportion'd every thing for an
equal Supply; but that his Wife, his
Children, and indeed Servants and all,
having not been us'd to the Coar&s;e hard
Bi&s;cuit-Bread, could at fir&s;t &s;carce bite it
with their Teeth; and contriv'd abun|dance
of &s;mall things, Puddings and Pies,
and Cakes of &s;everal &s;orts, and Bread,
&s;uch as their own little Oven would Bake,
only that wanting Yea&s;t, they could not
<PB N="111" REF="122">
&s;upply them&s;elves with &s;uch Bread as
they u&s;ually had, but were oblig'd to
make it heavy and &s;ad, not knowing
how to leaven their Bread, as &s;ome
Countries do. On the other Hand they
mingl'd Butter, and &s;ometimes fine Oil
with their Flower, and made abundance
of bak'd Things to &s;upply the Place of
Bread; and this was the Rea&s;on of their
Flower not holding out &s;o well as their
Bread.</P>
<P>However, as I may &s;uppo&s;e when he
brought his Family home again, and the
Markets were open and provi&s;ions came in
plenty again, and might be eaten freely,
he brought out what was left of his Maga|zine,
that is to &s;ay, of the Eatables and
Liquids, and made a Thanks-offering of
it to the Poor, nor was it a &s;mall quan;
tity in the whole, &s;eeing he had left.</P>

<P>This Account is given the more large|ly,
becau&s;e it may &s;tand as a Mark of
Direction, which will not merit any Ex|ception
<PB N="112" REF="123">
in the Manner. And I can a&s;&s;ure
my Reader, that &s;everal Families have
been pre&s;erved in this late dreadful Plague
at <HI>Mar&s;cilles</HI> by the &s;ame Method; and I
have &s;een Letters from thence full of the
Particulars, and acknowledging the Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>It is true that the poorer Inhabitants
are not able to do thus, and therefore
this Example or this Advice, does not
immediately reach to them. But as in
the fir&s;t part of this Work, I have men|tion'd
what Care might, and indeed
ought to be taken of the Poor; <HI>viz.</HI> to re|move
their Wives and Children, to keep
and &s;uccour them in particular, &s;epara|ting
them from the re&s;t. I &s;ay, that then
would the remaining Inhabitants, who
were able thus to retreat, do it in the
manner as is here de&s;cribed, t$$y would
nece&s;&s;arily employ &s;o many of the Men
who &s;hould remain as Porters and Watch|men
at their Doors, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t them
with Provi&s;ions from within, that even
tho&s;e poor Men would no$ be expos'd to
the Conver&s;ing with one another, which
is the fatal part, in &s;uch Extremities
as the&s;e.</P>
<P>It is nothing but the Nece&s;&s;ity of
going about among one another, which
prompts the Contagion, and extends it
into every Coner of the City; if the Poor
<PB N="113" REF="124">
cou'd live within Doors, as the Rich may,
the Poor would be as &s;afe as the Rich
are, but that Nece&s;&s;ity that &s;ends them
abroad to get their Bread, brings them
home Infected.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o much the Poor living
clo&s;e and not cleanly that Infects them,
their dirty Clothes and uncomfortable
Lodgings, and hard Fare, does not give
them the Plague, does not Infect them,
if &s;o, they would never be without it;
I will not &s;ay but it makes their Cure
more difficult, and want of Food and
of Phy&s;ick makes them &s;ink under it,
when they have it; but it is their going
abroad among one another that infects
them, and then want of Conveniences,
and of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted and lock'd a$ter,
cau&s;es them to peri&s;h fu&s;ter than others.</P>
<P>The whole Scheme o$ my Di&s;cour&s;e
therefore, aims at &s;eparating the People
as much as po&s;&s;ible from one another;
and on this depends their Safety and
Health; I mean as to &s;econd Cau&s;es and
the means of pre&s;erving it: As to the A|gency
of Providence, I am no way In|vading
it, or Impeaching the Wi&s;dom of
Heaven in the directing the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay, I reject (though with
D$cency) the Notions of tho&s;e People
who take upon them to tell us, that the,
<PB N="114" REF="125">
Plague is not convey'd by Contagion from
the Bodies Infected; it &s;eems to me to
be an Ill-grounded Hypothe&s;is, argued up|on
as the Per&s;ons who e&s;pou&s;e tho&s;e
Notions think fit; and as the Opinion is
boldly advanc'd again&s;t the Univer&s;al Ex|perience
of Mankind for many Ages,
I leave them to be confuted by the &s;ame
Experience.</P>
<P>However to avoid Caviling or making
this Work, which is written with a better
De&s;ign, a Scene of Debate, I leave them
to their own Notions, and tho&s;e that
plea&s;e to believe them, may venture
their Lives upon the Faith of it, if they
think fit; but I believe few will, and in
the mean time, I acknowledge as at the
beginning, that I write this upon a Suppo|&s;ition
of the common Hypothe&s;is, name|ly,
That the Di&s;temper is what we call
Catching or Contagious, that is to &s;ay,
The Sound are Infected by the Sick; let
it be in what manner they plea&s;e, whe|ther
by Effluvia from their Bodies; by
Animalcula mixt and drawn into our
Bodies with our Breath; or by the
Venome of the Tumours, Blanes and
Sores, or how you plea&s;e; and that Con|ver&s;ing
with tho&s;e who are Infected gives
the Infection, which is propagated in that
manner, from one to another: I &s;ay,
<PB N="115" REF="126">
I lay down this as a Principle, which Ex|perience
and the Judgment of very able
Phy&s;icians, and Men of long Practice
confirms to me; who&s;e Authority I mu&s;t
needs &s;ay, I have not yet &s;een overthrown,
and as the Hi&s;tory I have given of a Fa|mily
pre&s;erv'd by retiring from Conver|&s;ation,
is really the Hi&s;tory of &s;everal
Familes, rather than of one, and is a
perfect Model for future Practice. I
think that Account with &s;everal others,
which I cou'd give, within the Com|pa&s;s
of my own Knowledge, or the
Particulars whereof I have had from
the Per&s;ons of Credit. I &s;ay, the&s;e
are convincing Proofs, to me at lea&s;t,
of what I build upon, namely, That
the Di&s;temper is taken by Contagion
from the di&s;eas'd Bodies, let tho&s;e who
believe otherwi&s;e act as they &s;ee fit;
but let them remember that they cannot
&s;ay they have wanted due Caution, de|riv'd
from innumerable Examples of
tho&s;e who have been Infected by their
Conver&s;ing with others.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think, the publi&s;hing
&s;uch a va&s;t variety of Opinions in this
Ca&s;e, as we &s;ee every Day brought to
light, is like publi&s;hing the Cavils and
Opinions of Divines, in the great Di&s;pute
about the <HI>Trinity,</HI> dangerous in&s;tead of di|recting
<PB N="116" REF="127">
to the Readers; amu&s;ing the Peo|ple
&s;o, that (th$$ugh in the mo&s;t important
Article of Religion) they know not
what to conclude, or which Opinion to
accept</P>
<P>In like manner here, in the mo&s;t im|portant
Article of our Health, we are &s;o
perplex'd with the Opinions of the Pay|&s;icians;
&s;ome declaring the Plague not
dangerous one way, and &s;ome that it is
not dangerous another way; while by
common Experience, we find it dange|rous
every way and this carried up to &s;uch
a Degree as it is, that we know not whom
to follow, or whom to give Credit to.</P>
<P>My &s;hort Judgment, and which I leave
to experience, is this; That be the Bo|dies
of Sick Per&s;ons Infectious or not, be
it &s;afe to Vi&s;it and Conver&s;e with them,
or be it not, Things which we may
never determine in Theory; this is cer|tain,
that in declining Conver&s;ation with
the Sick nay in declining all Communi|cation
with one another, in time of In|fection,
there can be but little Error,
and 'tis the much &s;afer Way for all
People to act; In the Negative there
can be no Danger, the retreat then,
which I recommend, mu&s;t be acknow|ledg'd
to be the mo&s;t innocent mi&s;take
that any Man or Family can commit.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="128">
It is a fine Notion, if I had &s;aid a
fine &s;pun Notion, I had been excu&s;able, to
&s;ay that we are in no danger of Infection
from Conver&s;ing with infected Bodies;
But who do the&s;e Gentlemen think they
&s;hall per&s;wade to run the Hazard of the
Experiment? Nay, will the Gentlemen
them&s;elves &s;how us the Way? and if they
&s;hould we mu&s;t &s;ee through the whole
Vi&s;itation, before we can tell whether
they are in the right or no.</P>
<P>Nay, if it &s;hould happen that any
bold Adventurer &s;hould thus Hazard
the Experiment and live, even then it
does not prove the Thing to be true,
for he may live and not be Infected, and
yet I may catch it at the fir&s;t At|tempt
and be lo&s;t. Perhaps this Man's
Con&s;titution, or Precautions, or particular
Conduct, or his Fate, may prevent his be|ing
Infected, but yours or mine may not:
I here are infinite Numbers peri&s;h in a
Plague, that is true, and this convinces
us that it is a Contagion convey'd from
and catched of one another, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet in
the hott$&s;t and highe&s;t Infection that e|ver
was, &s;ome have e&s;caped and never
been Infected at all, although they may
h$ve liv'd among the infected Bodies all
the time: I knew a Sexton and Bearer
of a Pari&s;h in <HI>London,</HI> who Dug ali the
<PB N="118" REF="129">
Graves and help'd to carry all the Bo|dies
that were carried in Coffins to the
Grave, in the whole Pari&s;h he liv'd in,
and yet never had the Di&s;temper, and the
like In&s;tances of many others; but this is
as far from proving that the Di&s;temper
is not Infecting, as it proves that Mu&s;quet
Bullets do not Kill Men in an Army,
becau&s;e all that are Shot at or Wounded
do not die.</P>
<P>Some a&s;cribe it the goodne&s;s of Pro|vidence,
and to a mercifull Di&s;po&s;ition for
the Comfort of the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> at
that time, that the Per&s;ons nece&s;&s;ary to
tend the Sick, to bury the Dead, and to
a&s;&s;i&s;t in publick Matters were pre&s;erved,
and very &s;eldom had the Plague; as
Nur&s;es in the very Chambers of the Sick,
and in the <HI>Pe&s;t-Hou&s;es, Ho&s;pitals,</HI> &amp;c.
Cart-Drivers and Bell Men that carried
away the dead Bodies in the Night, and
Grave Diggers who a&s;&s;i&s;ted to bury them,
and the like; and as it was &s;aid, Market,
People who brought Provi&s;ions to Market,
and who, they &s;ay, never had the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>But (I) With due deference to Oral
Tradition this is a mi&s;take; it is true
poor People pre&s;s'd by their own Cir|cum&s;tances,
Trade and Workman&s;hip be|ing
at a kind of full Stop, were glad for
Bread at any Hazard, to undertake tho&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="130">
dangerous and di&s;mal Offices of tending
the Sick, and burying the Dead; and in
many Ca&s;es the Magi&s;trates of the Ci|ty
oblig'd them to do it; but then it
mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that many did
catch the Di&s;temper, and many of them
died, though as in other Ca&s;es, not all
of them.</P>
<P>(2.) After the Sickne&s;s had been &s;ome|time
among us, as in all Infections &s;ome
died, &s;o in this &s;ome had been in|fected
and recover'd; and tho' it is
true, that it did not perfectly &s;ecure
them from a Relap&s;e, or from having
it a &s;econd or a third time, or oftner
as was found by Experience; yet it was
a general Notion with the People that
they cou'd not have it twice, and that
made &s;uch as had recover'd, be the bold|er
in offering them&s;elves to tho&s;e Works;
and perhaps too they were not &s;o ea&s;ily
Infected as others were, tho' they were
not wholly &s;ecur'd; &s;o that by the time
that the Plague was come to its height
mo&s;t of the Nur&s;es and nece&s;&s;ary People
above, were made up of &s;uch as had been
infected and were recovered; and this
particular Circum&s;tance recommended
them to the Families they were employ'd
in, becau&s;e they then thought they were
&s;afe from lo&s;ing the Nur&s;e they had de|pended
<PB N="120" REF="131">
on, having her die in the Hou&s;e,
or having her carried away, when &s;he
was mo&s;t wanted, and, perhaps not any
other to be had.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, tho&s;e Peo|ple
not dying as others did, is very far
from being a convincing rea&s;on that the
Plague was not Contagious, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as to
the Market People, Higglers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who
brought Provi&s;ions to <HI>London,</HI> being &s;o
$ignally pre&s;erved by Heaven, in Mercy
to the di&s;tre&s;s'd Citizens, that none of
them had the Plague, or carried it home
to their Families. I would be very far
from le&s;&s;ening &s;o great and valuable a
Memorial of merciful Heaven, and of his
Care for the Good of his afflicted Crea|tures,
if I was &s;ure of the Fact; but as
I have never met with &s;ufficient Autho|rity
for the Thing or had it prov'd$ &s;o
as I might depend upon the Truth of it,
I &s;hall &s;ay no more than this to it, that
as tho&s;e who relate it, look upon it to
be little le&s;s than miraculous, &s;o as &s;uch
I &s;hould receive it, if it was prov'd to be
true; but if it were true, it neither way
proves that the Di&s;temper was not Catching.</P>
<P>But to come a little nearer home, if
this were true, what mean the Phy&s;icians
and the Government in <HI>France</HI> at this
time? And what are they doing there, in
<PB N="121" REF="132">
&s;urrounding the Towns which are Vi&s;ited
with their Soldiers, keeping in the Sound
with the Sick till they all Peri&s;h toge|ther?
What need of the dreadful Seve|rities
they have u&s;ed there, in Shooting
dead &s;o many Innocent People, who (made
de&s;perate by their Danger) have attemp|ted
to E&s;cape, either by Force or Secretly,
and to get away if po&s;&s;ible, out of the
Danger? If the poor de&s;perate Creatures
did not &s;ee, that to be lock'd up there a|mong
the Infected People was pre&s;ent
Death to them; and that they would be
unavoidably infected and lo&s;t, what
pu&s;hes them upon &s;uch de&s;perate At|tempts
for e&s;cape? in which they are al|mo&s;t
&s;ure to be di&s;cover'd, and if di&s;|cover'd,
are &s;ure to be kill'd without
Mercy. I &s;ay, what can pu&s;h them up|on
&s;uch de&s;perate Things, but the ap|parent
Knowledge of the Di&s;temper being
catching from the Bodies of their Friends
who were Infected.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, why &s;uch Severi|ties,
nay, Cruelties and Barbarites (for if
there was no rea&s;on for them, they mu&s;t
be call'd &s;uch) as &s;hooting to Death two
poor Innocent Children, who in meer
Duty to their di&s;tre&s;s'd Father, who lay
Sick in the Mountains, found means
to pa&s;s the Lines in <HI>Dauphine</HI> in the
<PB N="122" REF="133">
Night, and go to him to carry him Re|lief:
Which two poor Children, one 13
Years old and one 14, were &s;hot with|out
Mercy, and again&s;t the Entreaties
and Cries of the very Inhabitants where
they were taken? What need <HI>I &s;ay</HI> of &s;uch
inexorable Cruelty, if Nece&s;&s;ity and the
ju&s;t fear of Infection from the Bodies of
tho&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures, did not make
it ju&s;tifiable?</P>
<P>I might in&s;tance in many other Acts
of &s;evcrity; &s;uch as &s;hooting five Soldiers
who had the Guard of the Lines, for ha|ving
per&s;ued two Sheep, to Kill them
within the Lines, lea&s;t they &s;hould get
back and Infect the Country; &s;o that
the poor Men were Kill'd for their extraor|dinary
dilligence in their Duty; there are
more Stories of the like Nature, which we
have had publickly Printed and Written;
but as I cannot depend on the Truth
of the Particulars, I omit them; the gene|ral
Part, namely, that they do practi&s;e
the&s;e Things, and do &s;hoot and put to
Death all that attempt to E&s;cape, if
they come within their Reach, is un|doubted.</P>
<P>Now 'tis certain, the <HI>French</HI> who are a
Nation of Humanity, would never Ex|erci&s;e
&s;uch Severities upon their own
People$ I mean they would not as a Na|tion,
<PB N="123" REF="134">
and as a Government under whole|&s;ome
Laws, if they were not fully &s;atis|fy'd
that the Contagion of this Di&s;tem|per
is thus convey'd from the Bodies of
the Infected, to the Bodies of the Sound;
and that it was dangerous for the Sound
to Conver&s;e with the Sick.</P>
<P>This Opinon of theirs, 'tis evident
all their Phy&s;icians come into, and it is
allow'd that the <HI>French</HI> Court is not ill
furni&s;h'd with Gentlemen that have
made the greate&s;t Proficiency in the
Knowledge of Medicine, and in the Study
of Di&s;tempers, of any Nation what &s;oever.</P>
<P>Nor is it the Opinion of the Phy&s;icians
there only, but the &s;ame Notion is en|tertain'd
by all the Chri&s;tian World,
as appears by the Prohibiting Commerce,
and even Conver&s;ation with any Per&s;on
coming from <HI>France:</HI> which it is plain
proceeds from the Apprehen&s;ions, lea&s;t
tho&s;e Per&s;ons &s;hould be already Infected
with the Di&s;temper, and &s;hould Com|municate
it from their particular Bodies
to the People they come among.</P>
<P>Now if it was true, as the&s;e Men in|finuate,
that no Contagion can be con|vey'd
from one Body to another; then
all the Nations in <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> proceed at
pre&s;ent upon wrong Notions; all the Peo|ple
they Kill in the Severities I &s;peak of,
<PB N="124" REF="135">
are unju&s;tly and injuriou&s;ly Kill'd; and
there are ju&s;t &s;o many cold Blood Mur|thers
committed by them; like wi&s;e all the
Mea&s;ures taken to keep the People in
the places Infected, from coming among
the People that are Sound and not In|fected,
are ridiculous, and to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay no more to this Matter,
the contrary is an Amu&s;ement, and, if
I may give my Opinion, cannot extend
very far, nor will the Gentlemen that have
advanc'd it, I believe, get many Friends
to it, at lea&s;t not &s;uch as will venture
their Lives upon the Credit of the Opinion.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if I go on a mi|&s;take,
I err in much good Company, for
I have the Practice of the whole Chri&s;tian
World on my Side: Nay, tho' I were
to grant it was a mi&s;take, <HI>which however,
I can by no means do,</HI> yet I am right in
my Propo&s;als, in that I am laying down
Rules for the Pre&s;ervation of Mankind,
upon the Foot of that &s;ame Principle
which they all go upon; <HI>Namely,</HI> that of
the Di&s;temper being In&s;ectious, that is to
&s;ay, That the Infection is taken from one
to another by the Infected Bodies emit|ing
poi&s;onous Particles, either from
the Pores of the Body, or from the Breath,
or from &s;ome malignant Effluvia which
pa&s;s from the Body Infected, and are
<PB N="125" REF="136">
receiv'd by the Body at that time to be
Infected: When the World may, by the
introducing this new Opinion, change
their Methods univer&s;ally, then and not
before the Scheme I lay down may be
Voted u&s;ele&s;s. I might proceed to &s;ome
common Remedies or Pre&s;ervatives, which
have been found u&s;eful in times of In|fection
to tho&s;e who&s;e Circum&s;tances would
not permit them to retire from Com|pany,
and from Conver&s;ing with their
Neighbours: But our Phy&s;icianes, have
Crowded the World with Medicines, as
well Simple as Compound; and there is
no room to &s;ay any thing after them:
However, as I have no Notion, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s,
of venturing among Infected People
without any Pre&s;ervative, I cannot but
mention &s;ome of them; I have known that
&s;ome have pre&s;erv'd them&s;elves in the la&s;t
Plague 1665, by only having a Bottle of
<HI>Vinegar</HI> in their Hands, and being con|tinually
&s;melling to it: I my &s;elf have
rid thro'a Town Infected with the Plague,
with a Bunch of <HI>Rue</HI> in my Mouth and
have been &s;ecur'd, others have taken
<HI>Rue</HI> and <HI>Wormwood</HI> together. I know a
Phy&s;ician who Vi&s;ited &s;everal Patients,
even in the <HI>Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> in
1665, and went &s;reely into their Cham|bers,
but all the while he was in the
<PB N="126" REF="137">
Rooms would be Chewing a Stalk of <HI>An|gelica</HI>
in his Mouth, and every Morning
before he went among them, drank the
Quantity of an ordinary Gla&s;s of <HI>Canary,</HI>
with the Stalk of <HI>Angelica</HI> &s;teep'd in it,
and he never was Infected &s;o as to be
quite Sick with it.</P>
<P>Innumerable &s;uch Pre&s;criptions were
to be had, built on the Experience of
many who have practis'd them; but no|thing
of all this ever comes up to the
grand Experiment, which I have recom|mended
in this Work. I mean that of
&s;eparating our&s;elves, and retiring whol|ly
from Conver&s;ation, whether in Fami|lies
or otherwi&s;e, and laying in Store of
Provi&s;ions, to &s;hut them&s;elves as entire|ly
up as if <HI>Lord have Mercy,</HI> and <HI>a Cro&s;s</HI>
was &s;et on their Door.</P>
<P>Frequent Sweatings by tho&s;e that are
retir'd as above, cannot but be very
u&s;eful to them, as well for preventing the
Mi&s;chiefs which frequently follow upon
being too clo&s;ely confin'd, and want of
Air, as to keep the Body from any mi&s;|chief
receiv'd, or like to be receiv'd
from the nearne&s;s of the Contagion; but
then tho&s;e Sweatings &s;hould be very mo|derate
and gentle, and chiefly occa&s;ion'd
by &s;ome little Stirring and Exerci&s;e,
&s;uch as running up and down Stairs,
<PB N="127" REF="138">
or any brisk Motion, but with a &s;tric$
Re&s;erve again&s;t over tireing the Spirits o$
heating the Blood.</P>
<P>I object nothing again&s;t the Medicines
pre&s;crib'd by the Phy&s;icians. Every one
will act in that Ca&s;e as their Opinion of the
&s;everal Phy&s;icians they u&s;e prompts them;
all that I have thought needful of that kind;
I have tied down to Preparative Phy&s;ick,
as above, what is to be done when the Di&s;|a&s;ter
is come, when the Body is Infected,
and the Di&s;temper has &s;eiz'd the Blood,
that is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s or De&s;ign of this
Undertaking, nor does it come within the
Compa&s;s of what we call Preparations.</P>
<P>When the Blood is once Tainted, and
the Body Infected, Preparations are then
at an end: Then you mu&s;t look upon the
Fortre&s;s as effectually Be&s;ieg'd and formal|ly
Attack'd, and you mu&s;t mu&s;ter up
all the Strength of Nature, and Art
for your Relief.</P>
<P>But this is not my Part, as I have &s;aid;
but having brought up the &s;everal &s;tates
of Health to this length, I leave it to
talk of the other Part: I mean <HI>Prepara|tions
for the Plague;</HI> what Preparations I
have mention'd yet, are &s;uch as are
needful to pre&s;erve the Body from the
Plague: And when the Per&s;on has the
<PB N="128" REF="139">
Plague really upon him; I have no
more to &s;ay but this, he mu&s;t turn his
Thoughts another Way, <HI>viz.</HI> he mu&s;t
make Preparations for Death: I &s;ee no|thing
el&s;e before him, nor ought he to
expect any thing el&s;e. And this brings
me to the Second Part of my Work.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="129" REF="140">
<HEAD>PREPARATIONS
FOR THE
PLAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS is the harde&s;t part of the
Work by far: But of the
two, infinitely of greater Con|&s;equence;
as the enternal State
into which we are all to pa&s;s
from this Life, is of more Con&s;equence
than the pre&s;ent State.</P>
<P>Life and Time are indeed of an in|e&s;timable
Value, but they are only &s;o
or principally &s;o, as on the happy Con|clu&s;ion
of them, depends the eternal
Welfare of the Per&s;on to whom they
are &s;o valuable; and e&s;pecially, the Pre|parations
for an Eternal State, are only
<PB N="130" REF="141">
to be made in time, which once &s;lip'd
away, lo&s;t and unapply'd, is irrecovera|bly
lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>The Approaches of Death, are often|times
inperceptible, and the Attacks &s;ud|den;
the Di&s;tempers by which we are
carried away are violent; and it is a double
Terror to the dying Per&s;on to have the
Work of dying and the Work of Re|pentance
both upon his Hands together.
O Sinner! remmember that the Terrors
of thy Con&s;cience will be a Weight too
heavy to be born at the &s;ame time
with the Terrors of Death: Nay, the
Terrors of Con&s;cience, are tho&s;e alone
which give Terrors to Death, which
make the Pa&s;&s;age out of Life dreadful;
and the&s;e many times make a Di&s;ea&s;e
Mortal, which would not otherwi&s;e be
&s;o: Were the Di&s;ea&s;es and Ca&s;ualties of
which People frequently die in this po|pulous
City rightly given into the
<HI>Bills of Mortallity,</HI> many would be &s;et down
of other Di&s;tempers, than as we find
them: In&s;tead of <HI>Hang'd them&s;elves</HI> (being
Di&s;tracted) and <HI>Cut their own Throats</HI> (be|ing
Di&s;tracted) it would be &s;aid, <HI>Hang'd
them&s;elves</HI> (being in De&s;pair) and <HI>Cut their
own Throats</HI> (being in dreadful trouble of
Mind) in&s;tead of <HI>pain in the Head,</HI> it
would be &s;aid, <HI>pain in the Mind,</HI> in&s;tead of
<PB N="131" REF="142">
<HI>Convul&s;ions,</HI> it would be &s;aid, <HI>Horror of
Con&s;cience,</HI> and the like: I doubt not
but the&s;e Horrors I &s;peak of, throw the
Body into <HI>Fevers</HI> and <HI>Convul&s;ions,</HI> and at
lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e Di&s;tempers to de&s;troy us:
It is enough to have a violent <HI>Fever</HI>
drink up the Moi&s;ture and Life, and
not to have the Arrows of the Almighty
<HI>drinking up the Spirits;</HI> that therefore Chri|&s;tians
may prepare in time, for the
dreadful Moments which are approaching;
that when the Call is heard, no other
Noi&s;e may drown their Comforts; and
that the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Life, may now with|out
any delay be to prepare for Death,
I &s;ay, that they may be mov'd to do thus,
this Tract is written.</P>
<P>The Apprehen&s;ions we are under at
this time, of the approaching Calamity
which afflicts our Neighbours, are a
kind of Summons to this Preparation,
and that more forcible, than can be gi|ven
from the Mouth of Man; and many
Thou&s;ands will have rea&s;on to be thank|ful
for &s;o long a Warning, &s;o timely a
Summons; even all tho&s;e who li&s;ten to
the Voice of it: Let me add a Mite to
this Trea&s;ury; The goodne&s;s of God is
very Con&s;picuous in this, that as a Pe&s;ti|lence
&s;weeps whole Towns and Cities of
People away, and Death rages like an
<PB N="132" REF="143">
overflowing Stream, that there is little
or no time given for Repentance or cal|ling
upon God; little time to look up
or to look in: So that Notice given of
its approach, ought to be taken for the
time of Interval, for both looking up and
looking in, and be improv'd to that Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o merciful is God to us, that
we really have more time u&s;ually given
us, in the Ca&s;e of a Plague: I &s;ay, more
time than we have in mo&s;t &s;orts of other
Di&s;tempers, and that time ble&s;t with
greater Advantages: This is &s;o much a|gain&s;t
the Common Notions we have of
it, that it requires &s;ome Explanation,
but you will be more fully inform'd of
it, in a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e which happend
between &s;ome Relations in a Family in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
ju&s;t before the la&s;t great Plague.</P>
<P>The time before that dreadful Vi&s;ita|tion
was, <HI>as this is,</HI> a time of Apprehen|&s;ion
and Terror; Something like this
it is true, the Warnings were not &s;o long
or the Danger &s;o very remote: The Di|&s;temper,
according to that Eminent Phy|&s;ician
Dr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> was brought to <HI>Holland</HI>
on Board a Ship, in &s;ome Bales of Goods
from the <HI>Levant:</HI> I think from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> as
this Contagion now raging in <HI>France,</HI> was
<PB N="133" REF="144">
&s;aid to be brought in Bales of Goods from
<HI>Zidon</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>Cypras.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Holland</HI> it came over hither, how
it was brought over to us, or by who,
that was never particularly known, or at
lea&s;t not publickly: The fir&s;t that died
of it here, at lea&s;t that was put into the
<HI>Bills</HI> openly, as dead of the Plague, was
in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s in the <HI>Fields,</HI>
it was reported that the whole Family
died; and I have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe
they did too, but there was but one
Enter'd in the <HI>Weekly Bill,</HI> and this was
about <HI>December</HI> 1664.</P>
<P>This was Heaven's fir&s;t Alarm to the
City of <HI>London,</HI> for it was remarkable that
the Infection begun in the Heart of the
Kingdom, as I may call it; $t did
not begin in a remote place, as has been
the Ca&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> where it began at
<HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> above Four Hundred Miles off
of Paris, and &s;o came on gradually; but
it fir&s;t appeared in <HI>London</HI> it &s;elf, and <HI>as
I have &s;aid above,</HI> the fir&s;t that was pub|lickly
given in in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Pari&s;h, a|bout
the 20th of <HI>December</HI> 1664; as
this Blow was near the Heart, &s;o it
more nearly touch'd the People, and their
Apprehen&s;ions &s;eem'd to be in Proportion
more &s;erious and affecting.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="145">
Two Brothers and a Si&s;ter, the Chil|dren
of one Pious and &s;erious Mother, a
Widow, liv'd together in one Hou&s;e in
the City; they were all grown to Years
of Di&s;cretion, the$ Si&s;ter (the Younge&s;t)
being about Nineteen, and one of the
Brothers near Forty, the other about
Twenty Six Years of Age; the Si&s;ter
was a mo&s;t Religious and well In&s;tructed
Young Woman, knowing in all Religious
and Heavenly Knowledge; the Brothers
Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s engag'd in it and taken
much up with it; they had been all re|ligiou&s;ly
Educated, and were what we call
Sober and orderly People; but being Em|barra&s;s'd
in Bu&s;ine&s;s and hurry'd in the
World, getting Money and growing Rich,
they had not made the Concern of Eter|nal
Life the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre|&s;ent
Life, as we all ought to do.</P>
<P>The two Gentlemen were Merchants,
had liv'd abroad, and being return'd to
<HI>England,</HI> were entred into great Engage|ment
of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and had va&s;t Concerns
on their Hands; were Partners, and had
two or three Servants and Book-Keepers
that were daily in the Counting-Hou&s;e,
and doing Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well at the Water|&s;ide,
as at the <HI>Royal-Exchange</HI> with their
Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="146">
As the Elede&s;t of the two Brothers was
a Widower, and had but two Chil|dren,
who were very &s;mall, and that the
younge&s;t Brother was a Batchelor, the
young Lady their Si&s;ter was their Hou&s;e|Keeper,
and they call'd her familiarly
their Governe&s;s, and &s;uch &s;he was in|deed
many ways; being not only the
Guide of their whole Family which was
large, but a faithful Monitor to them|&s;elves

at fir&s;t with all the Succe&s;s that &s;he
wi&s;h'd for: Their Heads and Hearts as

and the World.</P>
<P>The old Lady did not live in the
Hou&s;e with them, but having two or
three younger Children with her, liv'd
a little way out of Town, having al&s;o
two other Sons, young Gentlemen of about
Nineteen or Twenty Years of Age, who
were abroad in <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> and plac'd
in very good Bu&s;ine&s;s by the Directions
and on Account of their Brothers.</P>
<P>The good Mother of this Family ha|ving
early Impre&s;&s;ions of the Danger that
was impending, began to have a heavy
Heart, and be deeply concern'd on account
of her Sons; and having receiv'd early
Impre&s;&s;ions as all the Town indeed had,
that a heavy and grievous Judgement
<PB N="136" REF="147">
was coming upon the City, and upon
the whole Nation; and as &s;he came
frequently to Town to her Sons, which
was as it were her other Family, &s;he
fail'd not on every Occa&s;ion to be
putting them in mind what a Stroke,
<HI>as &s;he &s;aid,</HI> was coming upon the Na|tion,

who&s;e eternal State was not &s;e|cur'd,
and who had not the Comfort of
a &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age out of Life in their View.</P>
<P>This &s;he urg'd upon her Children every
time &s;he came to &s;ee them, and particu|larly
would be repre&s;enting to them how
it was in <HI>London</HI> in the time of the great
Plague, as it was then call'd, which had
been 29 Years before, which I, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI>
very well remember, having liv'd here all
that while, and lo&s;t &s;everal Relations and
Acquaintances who died of the Infection,
at which time there died 10400 People
of the Plague in the City only; and

would be thought Prophetick; that the
Plague was not actually broken out be|cau&s;e
one Man had dy'd of it; that he
believ'd it was always in one part or o|ther
of the City a little; that the Plague in
1636, which &s;he remember'd held 8 Years,
and that every Year there died more or
le&s;s, from $00 to 3000, that there was
yet no Publication of it, and <HI>I hope,
Madam,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>there will not;</HI> and there|fore
that we &s;hou$d not be always al|larming
one another, as if it was at the
Door; that the $al mity was terrible
enough when it came; but that to be
always in a Fright about it, was to make
it a Judgment when it was no Judgment,
<HI>and the like;</HI> in a Word, like her Si&s;ter
Preachers, <HI>Mary Magdalen, &amp;c. her Words
&s;eem'd to them as Idl$ T$les,</HI> Luke 24. II.</P>
<P>However, like a true affectionate Mother
&s;he continu'd her monitory Di&s;cour&s;es to
them; you Sons, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> are grown up,
and are above my Admonition as the
Mother, but you cannot be out of the
reach of Exhortation, and my &s;peaking
to you, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> is with &s;o much regard
<PB N="138" REF="149">
to your Years, that you ought not how|ever
to take it ami&s;s that I pre&s;s you to
prepare for the dreadful time of a Vi&s;ita|tion
if it &s;hould come.</P>
<P>No Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Elde&s;t Son,</HI> none
of your Children will take it ami&s;s, but
we think you make your Company, which
was always plea&s;ant to us, be a little Me|ancholly,
for that you are always upon
this frightful Subject: I doubt it is too
much upon your mind and makes you
heavy Hearted, when you might be
Chearful; and then their Di&s;cour&s;e be|gan.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot look back Child with|out
Horror of Mind, upon the dreadful
time, in the Year 1625. I was but newly
Marry'd and Settl'd in the World, and
we were all full of Mirth, <HI>as you are now,</HI>
and on a &s;udden the Di&s;temper broke
out, and all our Smiles were turn'd into
Lamentations and Tears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It came &s;uddenly it may be, with|out
any Warning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, People had Warning
too; but we that were young People then,
<HI>ju&s;t as you are now,</HI> we would take no No|tice
of it; we were Marrying and giving
in Marriage to the very Day that it
came upon us; and when good People
&s;poke to us of Repenting, and preparing
<PB N="139" REF="150">
to meet the Lord in his Day of Wrath,
and humble our&s;elves under his mighty
Hand; we thought them ju&s;t as you do
now, too Melancholly and Flegmatick;
that they did not do well to Alarm the
People, and put Families and Cities into
Frights and Di&s;orders: And thus we
went on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well Madam,</HI> and yet for all that
it may be you thought as &s;eriou&s;ly of
it when it came as they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay Son, but they that had
thought &s;eriou&s;ly of it &s;o long before us,
had a great advantage of us, and were &s;o
much before us in their Preparations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They had &s;o much more indeed
to an&s;wer for, if they were not better
prepar'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, <HI>Son,</HI> it &s;hould be ra|ther
&s;aid, we had &s;o much the more to
an&s;wer for if we were wor&s;e prepar'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>Madam,</HI> What can we do in
the Ca&s;e as it &s;tands now? every one ought
to prepare for Death, whether there be
a Plague in the Town or no: Death
comes in a many other Shapes than
that of a pe&s;tilence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true Child, and I do
not &s;peak again&s;t daily Preparations for
Death, <HI>God &s;orbid</HI> I &s;hould; but when an
Infection comes, Child, Death &s;eems to
<PB N="140" REF="151">
come with more Terrors about him, cuts
down &s;wifter, and we have le&s;s time to
think of what is to follow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some reflect upon the Severity
of the Judgment upon that very Score,
in that People are &s;wept away with a
Stroke, and have &s;carce time to look up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No Son,</HI> let none &s;ay &s;o, for
I affirm, that God's Mercies are &s;o in|ter&s;pers'd
with his Judgments, that we
have abundant Cau&s;e to acknowledge
them, and ought to keep our Eye upon
it in this particular; namely, That God
always gives more time to People to
prepare for Death in the Ca&s;e of a Plague
than of an ordinary Di&s;temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How Madam!</HI> That cannot be, for
in the Plague People often die in Twelve
Hours after they are taken, whereas in
Fevers and other Di&s;tempers, they gene|r$$lly
lie as many Days or more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay Son, but then you do not
con&s;ider that the Plague generally ap|proaches
a Country by &s;low Degrees,
and you have many Months Warning
of it before it comes; &s;o that if it &s;wept
all away in a Day, there is no room to
call it Severity, for every one had Warn|ing
of it before Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But People do not look on the
Judgment as particular, till it touches
<PB N="141" REF="152">
them Per&s;onally, or that it Points to
them in a Family Capacity, that is to
&s;ay, till it has gotten into the Hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Folks do not take Warn|ing,
is their Folly and Fault; but that
God gives them Warning is their Mer|cy,
if they know how to make u&s;e of
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every Body is willing to hope
they &s;hall e&s;cape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>But every Body ought to
provide as if they were not to e&s;cape:
Every Soldier in the Army hopes to e&s;|cape
being Kill'd, but every Soldier puts
on his Head-piece that he may fare the
better if he is hit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We &s;hould prepare no doubt, but
to be apprehen&s;ive continually, as if we
were &s;ure to have the Di&s;temper, is even
to fright us into it: All Phy&s;icians a|gree
that we &s;hould keep our Minds
Ea&s;y and Calm, that the Pa&s;&s;ion of Fear
and Anger prepare the Heart to receive
and nouri&s;h the Infection, at lea&s;t to di&s;|pirit
and debillitate it, &s;o that it is not
duly Forti&s;y'd and Encourag'd to re&s;i&s;t
the Approaching Enemy which it is to
&s;truggle with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>You greatly mi&s;take the thing,
Child, and mi&s;take my meaning: I am of
the &s;ame Mind, and &s;ay as the Doctors
<PB N="142" REF="153">
do, though upon other Grounds; the
Mind &s;hould be kept calm and free,
that Nature might be a&s;&s;i&s;ted to repul&s;e
the Enemy that Attacks her; but then
I &s;ay that nothing can Animate and En|courage
the Mind, like a firm Re&s;igna|tion
to the Will of God, and a comforta|ble
Hope that it &s;hall be well with us
beyond Life; this is certainly the be&s;t
Preparation for the Di&s;temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deny but we &s;hould be
always preparing for Death, but we &s;hould
not be di&s;couraging our &s;elves before it
comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you call di&s;courag|ing
your &s;elves, Preparation is the only
Way to avoid being di&s;courag'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk of Preparation, as if I
was &s;ure it would come upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>As &s;oon as we have rea&s;on to
be &s;atisfied that the Di&s;temper is begun
and is among us, I think every one, <HI>&s;peak|ing
of his Preparations,</HI> &s;hould look upon
him&s;elf as if ab&s;olutely &s;truck, as much
as if he &s;aw the Tokens upon his Fle&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not that all Flegmatick
and Vapours, Madam? Do not many, <HI>do
ye think,</HI> in the Plague as they do in o|ther
Di&s;tempers, fancy they have it, till
they really bring it, and &s;o have it be|cau&s;e
they fancied they &s;hould have it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="143" REF="154">
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>You forgot what I &s;aid, <HI>Son:</HI> I
&s;aid as to our Preparations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>You di&s;tingui&s;h nicely, <HI>Madam,</HI>
but others will take it another Way:
You &s;ay we &s;hould always look upon
our Ca&s;e as if we really had the Di&s;tem|per;
certainly that would be poreing too
much upon a Thing &s;o dreadful! Why
it would make &s;ome People go di&s;tract|ed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I di&s;tingui&s;h clearly, <HI>Son,</HI> tho'
not &s;o nicely as you would have me: I
&s;ay, <HI>as to our Preparations,</HI> we &s;hould do
thus, that is to &s;ay, we ought to prepare
for Death, as if we had the Di&s;temper
ju&s;t now upon us, and my rea&s;on is good;
becau&s;e I can a&s;&s;ure you when the Body
is agitated with that Di&s;temper, there
will be as little Capacity as there may
be time to look up to God and to pre|pare
for Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Madam,</HI> you would have us
think our &s;elves all dead Men, or as if
we were under a Sentence of Death, on|ly
Repriev'd <HI>Sine die,</HI> a little while, and
to be Executed at the plea&s;ure of the
Judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly our Ca&s;e is no o|ther
than that in the whole ordinary
Cour&s;e of Life; but in this of the Plague
it is much more &s;o, e&s;pecially to &s;uch
<PB N="144" REF="155">
who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s and Circum&s;tances call
them to continue in the City on &s;uch
an Occa&s;ion, as you &s;ay <HI>Son,</HI> yours does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Madam,</HI> you have been in
<HI>London</HI> during two Plagues, that in 1625
and that in 1636, and you are &s;till alive,
Why may not we fare as well now if it
&s;hould come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>The more I have of the Mer|cy
of God to account for Child, but I
cannot &s;ay I was in the City all the while,
for the last Plague I was ab&s;ent in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI>
but the fir&s;t indeed, I &s;aw wonderful
Things and terrible to relate; and this
makes me &s;ay that we &s;hould all look
upon our&s;elves as dead Per&s;ons or as re|priev'd
Criminals, and giving up our&s;elves
entirely into God's Hands, &s;hould &s;tand
ready expecting to an&s;wer at the fir&s;t Call,
and &s;ay, <HI>Come Lord Je&s;us;</HI> for take my
Word, <HI>Son,</HI> if it comes you'll &s;ay, 'tis a
time to tremble at, a time to be pre|par'd
for, not a time to <HI>Prepare in.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>Madam,</HI> it may plea&s;e God to
Avert the Judgment, he may be better
to us than our Fears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;o no Man
would ever repent of his Preparations
if they were &s;incere, or &s;ay it was &s;o
much lo&s;t; but flatter not your&s;elf, <HI>Son,</HI>
with its not coming, it is not coming
<PB N="145" REF="156">
<HI>but come,</HI> Have you not &s;een it begun?
there are &s;everal dead of it already, and
more than you think of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>There has one or two died in
St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Pari&s;h indeed, but it was la&s;t
<HI>December,</HI> and we are now in <HI>March,</HI>
and there has been but one more, &s;o that
I hope 'tis over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That hoping 'tis over, is a Snare
of the Devil; flatter not your &s;elf with
it when the Plague begins, tho' there be
but one or two that die at fir&s;t, you ne|ver
hear it goes off &s;o, it always goes on
tho' it begins &s;lowly; and that &s;lowne&s;s
of its begining, is what I call the merciful
Warning given to us all, of the Approach
of the Judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that when one or two die, you
would have us take it that the Plague
is begun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do in&s;i&s;t upon it, and
that it always goes on; <HI>but farther,</HI> let
me tell you, I know very well, that
when our <HI>Weekly Bills</HI> &s;et down one or two
to die of the Plague, you may depend
upon there being more, for People are
always diligent to conceal their Families
being Infected, becau&s;e they would not
have their Shops for&s;aken, their Hou&s;es
&s;hut up, or them&s;elves be &s;hun'd as be|longing
to infected Families; and there|fore
<PB N="146" REF="157">
in the la&s;t Plague of 1636. I remem|ber
there was &s;o much Fraud u&s;ed by
the Pari&s;h Clarks, in forming the <HI>W$ekly
Bills,</HI> that it was certain there died 200
a Week of the Plague, when by the <HI>Bills</HI>
there was only 10, 12 or 15, or therea|bouts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that you look on the Plague
as a thing already begun among us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Child,</HI> I do! and I be|lieve
firmly that it is &s;o at this time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what would you have us
do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>My an&s;wers, <HI>Son,</HI> are &s;hort to
that Que&s;tion, whether you mean by US,
us of this Family, or US of the Nation:
I would have us return to God, lie at
his Feet&punc; take the Words of the Scripture,
and &s;ay,&mdash;<HI>Thou ha&s;t &s;mitten, and thou
wilt bind us up,</HI> Ho&s;. 6. 1. In a Word, I
would have every one prepare them&s;elves
for Death, prepare together, and prepare
apart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>As much as if they were on their
Death Beds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay indeed, the very &s;ame; and
be Thankful, <HI>humbly Thankful</HI> for the time
allow'd for it; Thankful that God had
in Mercy &s;pa$d them an $our with a
re&s;erve of Health and Strength, to turn
to him and Repent; for then be a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="147" REF="158">
when the Vi&s;itation begins, there will be
no room for it, all will be fill'd with
Horror and De&s;olation, every one mourn|ing
for him&s;elf; no Compo&s;ure, no Com|pa&s;&s;ion,
no Affection; none to Comfort,
none to A&s;&s;i&s;t; nothing but Death in all
its mo&s;t di&s;mal Shapes, and in its mo&s;t
frightful Appearances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Madam,</HI> if your Rule was
to be ob&s;erv'd there &s;hould be an imme|diate
Ce&s;&s;ation of all Bu&s;ine&s;s, from the
King upon the Throne, to the School-Boy
to the Beggar in the Street; all
&s;hould fall on their Knees together, like
the People of <HI>Nineveth?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that &s;uch a Sight was to be
&s;een! I am &s;o fully per&s;waded that the
Plague that is coming, and that I &s;ay is
now begun among us, is a Me&s;&s;enger &s;ent
from God, to Scourge us from our crying
Sins, that if the Cry of this Nation was
as Univer&s;ally &s;ent up to Heaven, as
was that of the Citizens of <HI>Nineveth,</HI>
and with the &s;ame &s;incerity of Humilia|tion;
I &s;ay, I firmly believe, that as was
then the Ca&s;e, God would <HI>repent him of
his fierce Anger, that me Peri&s;h not.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you will not &s;ee that here
<HI>Madam?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>Child I doubt not,</HI> and there|fore
I am not talking of National Humilia|tions,
<PB N="148" REF="159">
but of Family and Per&s;onal Hu|miliations
and Repentance, and that,
not on expectation that God &s;hould
withdraw the Judgment from the Coun|try
wherein we live, but that he would
withold his Hand, and the Hand of his
de&s;troying Angel from our Hou&s;es, and
our Families, and our Per&s;ons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Madam,</HI> you would put us
all into Confu&s;ion, you would Fright and
Terrify us &s;o, that we mu&s;t &s;hut up our
Shops, Embargo our Ships, clo&s;e our
Ports; the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e would have
no Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Exchange no Merchants,
the Merchandize no Market?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay again, O that I could &s;ee
&s;uch a Sight in <HI>London:</HI> It is true, it wou'd
be as you de&s;crib'd it; and indeed it
ought to be &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>God &s;orbid, <HI>Madam,</HI> Why we &s;hou'd
be all frighted out of our Wits?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I wi&s;h I cou'd &s;ee
them &s;o out of their Wits as that comes
to; I &s;hould expect that then &s;ome Mi|racle
of Deliverance would follow, as was
the Ca&s;e of <HI>Nineveth,</HI> but it is not to
be expected here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, <HI>Madam,</HI> I believe not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, there is not a Spirit
of National Humiliation among us; but $word$
&s;ee National Sins rather, come up to &s;uch
<PB N="149" REF="160">
height as they never were at in this Nati|on
before; the Dreg$ of the late Wars are
not purg'd out, and will not be purg'd out
but by Fire; that is to &s;ay, by the Fire
of God's Judgment, which is already be|gun
among us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they have been as bad for|merly,
<HI>Madam?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have been as bad for|merly,
in the revelling Days of King&mdash;but
never wor&s;e than now;
and this even under the pretence of greater
Reformation; all manner of Wickedne&s;s
and p$blick Debauchery being let loo&s;e
among us, and breaking in upon us like
a Flood, encourag$d even by tho&s;e who
ought to &s;uppre&s;s them; and by the Ex|ample
of tho&s;e from whom we hoped to
find Examples of good, and at lea&s;t to
have Prophanene&s;s and Immoralities pu|ni&s;hed
and di&s;courag'd by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The World was always as wicked,
I think, as 'tis now, <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;ince I re|member
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we hoped this late turn
of Times &s;hould have given a Blow to
the Wickedne&s;s of the Times and I think
it has rather made them wor&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That lies upon the great Men,
<HI>Madam,</HI> who &s;hould have reform'd us,
and who &s;hould have &s;hew'd better Ex|amples
<PB N="150" REF="161">
to the People; and you &s;ee they
have appointed Days of Humiliation for
us: What can they do more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and God may vi&s;it our
Magi&s;trates as well as others; but cer|tainly
this Judgment will fall upon the
People too; for tho' the other are Princi|pal,
the People are guilty, and 'tis from
them that God expects a general Re|pentance;
and therefore National Humi|liations
are the Duty of the People on
the&s;e Occa&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee nothing in tho&s;e publick
Humiliations but Formality, and making
a kind of Holiday of it; a Day of Idle|ne&s;s
and Sloth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that I hope among &s;e|rious
People it is otherwi&s;e, but in the
general it is too true; and therefore
to $word$ no farther into a Complaint of
what we cannot mend, this, however,
we can do; every one can reform for
them&s;elves, and repent for them&s;elves;
and this is what I would fain &s;ee in
our Families, every one mourning apart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But even that is not likely to be
&s;een in the Manner you would have it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Son,</HI> and therefore I am for
having every Body prepare for the Plague,
by preparing for Death, as &s;eriou&s;ly and
with as much Application, as if they
<PB N="151" REF="162">
were actually. Infected, and had the Di|&s;temper
upon them</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Preparations for Death, <HI>Madam.</HI>
What do you call Preparations for Death?
In the fir&s;t place, if I am to prepare for
Death, I mu&s;t make my Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Child, do not make a
Je&s;t of it; I am &s;peaking with a Heart
full of Grief, upon a Subject, which when
it comes, will perhaps be as terrifying to
you as to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and more too, <HI>Madam,</HI> I am
not je&s;ting with it I a&s;&s;ure you; but
I would hope it may not come, it may
plea&s;e God to prevent it; and therefore
I cannot think of &s;uch a Solemn entring
upon Preparations for dying, as if it was
this Minute upon me; for then, as I &s;aid,
I mu&s;t make my Will, &s;hut up my Coun|ting-Hou&s;e,
&s;top all my Shipping of
Goods, and &s;elling of Goods, put off my

the&s;e Ti$ngs, I $word$ tell you, th$$ every
Man that has any Family Affairs to &s;ettle,
ought to do it forth with; for a time of
the Plague will be no time for making of
Wills and &s;ettling E&s;tates, I a&s;&s;ure you, any
more than it will be for Repentance,
when Mini&s;ters will not be found to Com|fort
<PB N="152" REF="163">
the Souls of dying Penitents; it may
be found &s;till harder to find Seriveners
to make their Wills: When Flus bands are
abandon'd of their Wives&punc; and Wives of
their Husbands, Fathers of their Children,
and Children of their Fathers and Mo|thers;
when every one flies from another
for fear of their own Lives, there will be
no room for fettling Affairs, as you call it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Child, 'tis much wor&s;e to
die in that Condition it &s;elf, than with

<P>I cannot think that to move

be frightful, but 'tis really not &s;o re|mote

publick Mi&s;chiefs, it does hurt to the

<P>Well, <HI>Madam,</HI> that is true too,

Peoples Minds with the Fears of publick

putting us all in an Uproar; as <HI>Jonah</HI>'s

<P>Nay, nay, what with the Mother

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>Son,</HI> to put an end to all
the frivolous Pleadings about frighting

per&s;wade People to Preparations for Death
becau&s;e &s;uch a Judgment is likely to
<PB N="159" REF="170">
come upon them, is not alarming or
frighting them at all; a &s;erious per&s;wad|ing

them to put them&s;elves into &s;uch
a Po&s;ture, as that they may not be fright|ed
or &s;urpriz'd or alarm'd, for to be pre|pared,
is to be pa&s;t being frighted, and
to be in the only Condition that gives
Courage: You may as well &s;ay, <HI>John</HI> the
<HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> frighted the People, when he prea|ched
to them, and cried, <HI>Repent for the

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Child,</HI> I only pre&s;s to
the pre&s;ent going about it, becau&s;e the

complain that this is frighting People, in
which I think you are mi&s;taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Madam,</HI> if you mean no o|therwi&s;e,
I join with you with all my

by all ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Argument to
Repentance and Reformation: I did not
deny that, I only &s;aid I hope, the Plague
may not be &s;o near as you fear it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Son,</HI> we will not differ
about that; if it plea&s;es God to &s;pare
us, and to &s;pare the Land in which we
live, I &s;hall be one of the fir&s;t to rejoice
and give thanks; and tho' I dare not
&s;ay, I expect it, I &s;hall not cea&s;e to pray for
it, &s;till carrying this along with me in all
I have to &s;ay of it, That to Repent and
Reform our Lives and turn with all our
Hearts to the Lord, which is what I mean
by Preparations, is the only way to be
un&s;urpriz'd at it when it comes upon us:
A Mind &s;uitably prepar'd, is a Mind for|tify'd
and made bold to meet the Wor&s;t;
prepar'd to give up its &s;elf into the Hands
of a merciful Saviour; a Heart prepar'd,
is the Heart the Scripture &s;peaks of, when
<PB N="161" REF="172">
it &s;ays, <HI>He &s;hall not be afraid of Evil
Tid$ngs, who&s;e Heart is fixed, tru&s;ting in the
Lord,</HI> P&s;alm 1127.</P>
<P>Thus this Con$erence between Mother
and Son ended for that time; it was now
about the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1665, and there
had died but one of the Plague &s;ince <HI>De|cember,</HI>
and that was in the beginning
of <HI>February;</HI> &s;o that the Elde&s;t Brother
us'd frequently to laugh at his Si&s;ter a|bout
the long Dialogue they had held with
their Mother, on the Subject of the Plague
coming upon them and how it was ac|tually
begun; and once or twice Je&s;ted
with her a little Prophanely, as &s;he thought,
about her Preparations, as &s;he call'd them,
for the Plague.</P>
<P>This griev'd the Young Lady, and
made her &s;hed Tears &s;everal Times; and
once &s;he took the Freedom to &s;ay, Dear
Brother, you Je&s;t at my Preparations with
too much Rea&s;on, they being but very
weak and imperfect; I pray God I may
be able to prepare my &s;elf better again&s;t
&s;uch a dreadful time, if ever it &s;hould
come; but I be&s;eech you Brother, to take
care that your own Preparation be not a
Je&s;t indeed, when &s;uch a Time comes; and if
it &s;hould be &s;o, how you will be able to &s;tand
it, for certainly nothing but a Mind well
prepar'd, can be able to bear up; How
<PB N="162" REF="173">
&s;hall our Hearts endure, or our Hands
be &s;trong in &s;uch a Day as that?</P>
<P>It was in the very angui&s;h of her Mind
that &s;he &s;aid this to her Brother, and
not with any Pa&s;&s;ion or Di&s;plea&s;ure at
his ill u&s;ing her; but &s;he did it with &s;uch
Seriou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uch Gravity, and &s;o many
Tears, that he was very much affected
with it, ask'd her Pardon, told her he
would not je&s;t with her any more upon
that Subject, that he was &s;atisfy'd &s;he was
much better prepar'd than he was, and
that &s;he was in the Right; that he would
for the future do all that lay in his
Power to encourage her Preparations; that
tho' he had not receiv'd &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions
him&s;elf from his Mother's Di&s;course, as
&s;he had, yet, he was far from thinking
her in the Wrong; and that &s;hould &s;uch
a time come, as their Mother had talk'd
of, he could not deny but &s;he was much
better prepar'd to &s;tand it than he was,
but that his dependance was that God
would &s;pare them, and not bring &s;uch a
Calamity upon them.</P>
<P>This heal'd that little Wound his loo&s;e
way of talking had made, and his Si&s;ter
was pacify'd; &s;he told him, &s;he was glad
to find him more &s;erious on a Subject &s;o
Weighty; that as to the Freedom he
took with her, that was nothing; but that
<PB N="163" REF="174">
it griev'd her &s;o, that &s;he cou'd not bear
it, to hear him &s;peak &s;lightingly of the
mo&s;t dreadful Judgments of God, that
were at that time abroad in the Earth;
that as &s;he was entirely of her Mother's
Opinion, that it would not be long be|fore
it broke out here, <HI>however, he might
cen&s;ure&punc; and perhaps ridicule that thought as
Melancholly and Vapouri&s;h,</HI> and that, <HI>as &s;he
&s;aid,</HI> &s;he was fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Belief
of it, &s;o it cou'd not but very &s;orely afflict
her for his &s;ake, to think how light he
made of it: And that her Satisfaction was
as great, in proportion, to &s;ee him abate
of the Levity with which he had talk'd
of tho&s;e Things.</P>
<P>It was not above a Fortnight after
this Di&s;cour&s;e, but the Town h$d ano|ther
Alarm, and her Brother was the Per|&s;on
that brought her home the News of
it; for about the 20th of <HI>April,</HI> the
News was &s;pread all over the Town,
that the Plague was broke out again in
St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Pari&s;h, and that there was a
whole Family dead of it.</P>
<P>The young Lady was in her Chamber
one Morning, when her Brother, having
been out about his Affairs, came home
in a very great Concern, and coming
up to her Door, <HI>O Si&s;ter,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>we
are all undone.</HI> Undone! &s;ays his Si&s;ter,
<PB N="164" REF="175">
<HI>what's the Matter;</HI> he cou'd not &s;peak a|gain
for a good while; but as his Si&s;ter
was frighted, and pre&s;s'd him again, with
repeating the Words, <HI>what's the Matter?</HI>
at la&s;t he cries out again, <HI>We are all un|done,</HI>
Si&s;ter! <HI>my Mother and you were both
in the right,</HI> the PLAGUE is BEGUN!</P>
<P>He appear'd in the greate&s;t Con&s;terna|tion
imaginable, and his Si&s;ter had much
to do to keep him from Swooning; his
Heart, as he &s;aid afterwards was &s;unk
within him, his Thoughts all in Con$u|&s;ion,
and the Affairs both of Body and
Soul, lay heavy upon him (for as I &s;aid
above, he was a Merchant, and engag'd
in a va&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s). His Si&s;ter receiv'd
the News without any fright or &s;urprize,
but with a calm Mind, &s;tood &s;till a while,
and as it were mu&s;ing to bring her Mind
to a &s;ettl'd Frame, while her Brother
went on with his Exclamations, at
length lifting up her Eyes and Hands,
<HI>'Tis the Lord,</HI> cries &s;he, <HI>let him do what
&s;eemeth Good in his Sight;</HI> and immediate|ly
apply'd her&s;elf to relieve her Brother,
and get &s;omething for him to take, to re|&s;tore
his Spirits, Comforting him with
her Words, as well as Actions.</P>
<P>He was not &s;o overwhelm'd, but that
he cou'd perceive the &s;urprizing Manner
with which his Si&s;ter, <HI>tho' &s;o young,</HI> receiv'd
<PB N="165" REF="176">
the News; and how free from any Op|pre&s;&s;ions
or &s;inking of her Spirits; how
it did not di&s;compo&s;e her, &s;o as to hinder
her Concern for him, and when he came
a little to him&s;elf, he &s;aid aloud, O
Si&s;ter! you are happy, that took the
early Coun&s;el of our <HI>Dear Mother;</HI> with
what a different Courage does a pre|par'd
mind receive the Impre&s;&s;ions of the
mo&s;t dreadful Things, from one that be|ing
Carele&s;s and Negligent in the&s;e Things
as I have been, entertains the fir&s;t
Thoughts about them, not till they are
ju&s;t upon him?</P>
<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, do not talk &s;o
of me; my Preparations are poor, empty
Things, I have no Preparations but the&s;e
few, an imperfect Repentance, and an
humble Re&s;olution to ca&s;t my &s;elf upon
infinite Mercy; and I hope, you have
gone beyond me in all the&s;e, for you have
more Knowledge, more Years, more Ex|perience
and more Faith too than I have,
or el&s;e it is but very weak.</P>
<P>You are happy, <HI>Child,</HI> let the Judg|ment
come when it will, &s;ays her Bro|ther,
but I have all my Work to do; I
have had more Years and more Know|ledge
you &s;ay; and I mu&s;t add, that I
have more Work to do, more Talents to
account for, more mi&s;pent time to an&s;wer
<PB N="166" REF="177">
for, and I have made no Preparation for
this &s;urprizing Condition we are all like
to be in, you know I de&s;pis'd it all.</P>
<P>She had be&s;ides this Di&s;cour&s;e, inquir'd
of him, how Things were, and how he
under&s;tood that, as he call'd it, <HI>the Plague
was begun:</HI> He gave her an account that
there had been two Men buried in St.
<HI>Giles</HI> in the <HI>Fields;</HI> that it was true there
was but two put in the <HI>Weekly Bill;</HI> but
that he was a&s;&s;ur'd there were two or three
Hou&s;es Infected, and that five People were
dead in one, and &s;even in another; and
that the Number of Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s
Pari&s;h, which u&s;ed to be about 16 or 18
at mo&s;t, was now Increa&s;ed to 30, which
intimated &s;trongly that the Increa&s;e was
by the Plague, tho' they conceal'd it, and
put them in of other Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>This was a terrifying Account, and he
was exceedingly Affected with it him&s;elf,
as you &s;ee; as for the young Lady his
Si&s;ter, who had long us$d her&s;elf to the
Thoughts of the&s;e Things; who expected
it to be as it happen'd, and who from
her Mother's Di&s;cour&s;e, having for &s;ome
Months look'd upon the Di&s;temper as
begun, had &s;eriou&s;ly apply$d her&s;elf to the
great Work of <HI>Preparation for Death,</HI> and
was come to that happy State of being
entirely re&s;ign'd to the Di&s;po&s;al of Heaven;
<PB N="167" REF="178">
this being her Ca&s;e, I &s;ay, &s;he was far le&s;s
&s;urpriz'd with it than her Brother, and
&s;tood as it were, ready to &s;ubmit to the
Will of God, in whatever way it &s;hould
plea&s;e him to deal with her; and thus &s;he
abundantly made good the Principle her Mo|ther
argued upon, <HI>viz.</HI> that to &s;peak of the
Plague before hand as in View, and make
Preparations for it as a thing certain, was
&s;o far from being a needle&s;s allarm to the
People and frighting and terrifying them,
that it was the only way to pre&s;erve them
from being frighted and terrify'd at it,
when it really came upon them; and was
the only way to keep the publick Peace&punc; as
he called it, by keeping the People compo|&s;ed,
and free from the Confu&s;ions and tu|multuous
Hurries which they are other|wi&s;e
apt to fall into on &s;uch Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But the Scene was not as it were yet
&s;pread, or the Tragedy begun; there was a|nother
Prelude to appear, even in the nar|row
compa&s;s of this one Family; O may
it not be the Ca&s;e of many among us, upon
the pre&s;ent View of Things of the like
kind.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t Di&s;orders of this Thing
were a little abated, and this Gentleman
come a little more to him&s;elf, Things
took a new turn with him; he was ne|ce&s;&s;arily
embarra&s;s'd in his Bu&s;ine&s;s in the
<PB N="168" REF="179">
Day, and in Company in the Evening;
but in the Morning had always a little
Conver&s;ation with his Si&s;ter; and &s;he &s;oon
ob&s;erved that after the fir&s;t two or three
Days, in which he continued much af|fected
with the Danger they were all in,
and his own unprepar'd Condition al&s;o,
as he own'd it to be; I &s;ay, after this
&s;he ob&s;erv'd that he dropt the Di&s;cour&s;e
by little and little; till at la&s;t he &s;aid no|thing
at all of it to her for three or four
Days; upon this, one Morning as they
were talking together, &s;he broke in upon
him with it thus: Dear Brother, &s;ays &s;he,
you tell me no News now, nor how
we &s;tand as to this terrible Stroke that
is coming upon us; I cannot but be very
much concern'd to hear what Condition
we are in, Pray how does it go on?</P>
<P>God be prai&s;ed, &s;ays he, the Di&s;temper
is &s;top'd again; they &s;ay, it was only a
violent Fever &s;eized one or two Families,
and that the People have been in &s;uch a
fright about it, by the ra&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome
Old Women that &s;et up a Cry of the
Plague, that it has put all the Town in
an uproar, but 'tis &s;top'd; and I &s;aw the
Weekly Bill to Day, the Number of
Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI> are Decrea&s;ed again,

than u&s;ual.</P>

out like a Fire that had been &s;mother'd
with hot A&s;hes; and what Havock it made,
and the like at <HI>Gallipoly,</HI> and on the <HI>Ca|labrian</HI>
Coa&s;t; depend upon it the Di&s;tem|per

<P>O <HI>Brother,</HI> you do by the Dan|ger

put it off as long as you can; you talk

a very few Days the Plague be about us,

you will &s;ee People preparing to get

<P>I do not &s;ee that we can go
out of it, at lea&s;t not I; unle&s;s I will give

<P>O I have mock'd God, I &s;ay,
with my former Preparations; when I

fright was over, and we flatter'd our
&s;elves, that the de&s;troying Angel was
pa&s;s'd over, I cool'd and abated in my
Warmth, and became the &s;ame loo&s;e
wicked Fellow I was before, I have broke
all my Vows and Re&s;olutions, drop'd my

<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but it may be too late

<PB N="184" REF="195">
in the Agonies of a Plague&punc; Swelling,

with the Thoughts of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1&s;t. Bro.</SPEAKER>

<P>O <HI>Brother,</HI> who&s;e Heart can
endure, or who&s;e Hands be &s;trong
in the Day that God &s;hall deal with them?
God is now taking us all into his own
Hands; we &s;hall no more be able to dally
with him repent and go back and re|pent
again, and go back again: O'tis
dreadful Work to make a Je&s;t of our Re|pentance

<PB N="185" REF="196">
<SPEAKER>1&s;t. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I be&s;eech you, <HI>Brother,</HI> Com|po&s;e
your &s;elf, you will die with the
Fright indeed at this rate; Come, I'll go
out and &s;ee what I can learn of it, and
what Mea&s;ures are to be taken.</P>
<P>Thus this Di&s;cour&s;e ended al&s;o, and the
elder <HI>Brother</HI> went out into the City, and
he found it to be all true as his <HI>Brother</HI>
had &s;aid; that the Plague now &s;pread in|to
&s;everal Pari&s;hes at the other end of the
Town, and that there was particularly
in the old Place, five of &s;ix Families In|fected,
that is, at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s near <HI>Long-Acre,</HI>
and about the North End o$ <HI>Drury-Lane;</HI>
al&s;o it &s;pread down <HI>Drury Lane into</HI>
St. <HI>Clements</HI> Pari&s;h, and the other way
into St. <HI>Andrews, Holbourn;</HI> &s;o that it ap|parently
went forward towards the City,
and the next <HI>Weekly Bill</HI> had Nine Per&s;ons
put in of the Plague, be&s;ides tho&s;e that
were Conceal'd.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t <HI>Brother</HI> came home in the
Evening, and as he found all that his
<HI>Brother</HI> &s;aid was true, he was very anxious
about it, tho' he did not di&s;cover it &s;o
much as his <HI>Brother;</HI> but in &s;hort, the
whole Hou&s;e was very Melancholly; it
is true the Younger's Melancholly was
different from the re&s;t, and very parti|cular,
becau&s;e it was attended with a
<PB N="186" REF="197">
Sadne&s;s of $$$ther kind; I mean the great
Concern he was under for his future
State.</P>
<P>He had &s;everal Conver&s;ations upon the
Subject $word$ his <HI>Brother,</HI> which chiefly
turn'd upon the Mea&s;ures, that they
were to take to pre&s;erve them&s;elves, and
to put their Bu&s;ine&s;s in a Po&s;ture to re|ceive
as little Damage as Po&s;&s;ible, by
&s;o general interruption as it was like to
meet with on this Occa&s;ion; but as the&s;e
Things do not &s;o nearly concern the Af|fair
of religious Preparations, I have no
exact Account of them, nor are the Par|ticulars
of any Value in this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus much I learn from what I have
Collected, namely, that he did not receive
any manner of Satisfaction or Comfort
from his Elde&s;t <HI>Brother,</HI> in the particular
Thing that afflicted him; and continu|ing
very di&s;con&s;olate, his pious <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI>
who was greatly concern'd for him,
came into his Chamber one Day about
ten Days after the fir&s;t talk with his
<HI>Brother,</HI> where he was fitting very Pen|&s;ive
and Heavy, and began to Comfort
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> I am very &s;orry
to &s;ee you in this melancholly, di&s;courag'd

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray for you, <HI>Brother!</HI> that I

<P>No, no, Come &s;it down here,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, you are quite wrong;
my <HI>Brother</HI> out does us all, he is like one
above it all, that liv'd un&s;haken with any
Apprehen&s;ions whatever; he has a &s;trong

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Si&s;ter, Si&s;ter,</HI> you mi&s;take the
Point; my <HI>Brother,</HI> puts the Evil day far
from him, buoys him&s;elf up with Hopes
that the Judgment will pa&s;s over, and
that it is not &s;o near or &s;o certain, as
we have all rea&s;on to &s;ee it is; and he
flatters him&s;elf with this, or with e&s;cap|ing
<PB N="188" REF="199">
it if it comes: I tell you he has no
more Courage than other People; but I

of &s;uch Danger, but upon very good
Ground; he has a perfect Calm in his Mind
for ought I &s;ee&punc; &s;ure that can never be
but upon a firm Dependance upon God,
and a full Satisfiction of his future State.

God's Will.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ay, <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> that

I neither; you are in a better State than
any of us.</P>

<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> do not &s;ay &s;o of me,
you grieve me extremely, I that am the

</SP>
<SP>

Duty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>We talk of Preparations, and
&s;ome preach up early Preparations; I
know nothing we can do, but learn to

die at the Feet of Chri&s;t, as mi&s;erable

his Sight; and this is a Work proper to
go about, even now; I am &s;ure I mu&s;t

<P>I have done nothing, and can do
nothing; neither can any of us do any

I &s;peak of another Work, <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> that lies
hard and heavy upon my Spirits: I have
a long mi&s;pent Life to look back upon,
I have an Ocean of Crimes to launch
thro', a Weight that &s;inks the Soul, and
without God's infinite Mercy will &s;ink
it for ever; what is re&s;igning to God's
di&s;po&s;al to this? no Man can re&s;ign to
be eternally lo&s;t; no Man can &s;ay he &s;ub|mits
to be rejected of God; I could chear|fully
<PB N="191" REF="202">

<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Brother,</HI> I did not mean &s;o;
we mu&s;t re&s;ign our Bodies, but we are

the Pardon of our Sins&punc; the Sanctifying
our Hearts, and the &s;aving our Souls;

Chearfulne&s;s and Satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother,</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> now you come
to me; this Pardon is not to be obtain|ed,

<P>But, <HI>Brother,</HI> tho' the having

be a di&s;couraging thing, and that as you
<PB N="192" REF="203">
&s;ay, a Sick Bed or the time of Vi&s;itation,
is not a time for it, yet Ble&s;&s;ed be God,
it is not forbidden then; it does not make
our Repentance unlawful, it only unfits
us for it; neither, as you &s;ugge&s;t, does
repenting at la&s;t, make the Repentance be
le&s;s &s;incere, it may indeed render it &s;u&s;|pected
to our&s;elves; but it does not fol|low
that it cannot be &s;incere becau&s;e it
is late.</P>
</SP>

<P>The time is laps'd, Death is

<P>It is true, the Evil, I doubt is

<P>That's true, but what is that
Moral to my Ca&s;e.</P>

<P>Why, <HI>Brother,</HI> he that told that

that Story for?</P>

<P>Here we can follow this happy Couple
no farther at pre&s;ent, <HI>that is,</HI> in their
particular Conver&s;ation, but it is to be
recorded for the Example and Encou|ragement
of others, in like Ca&s;e, that they
<PB N="206" REF="217">
agreed to &s;pend two Hours every Even|ing,
and an Hour every Morning toge|ther
in her Clo&s;et, where they pray'd
together, read the Scripture together,
and di&s;cour&s;ed together as their particu|lar
Circum&s;tances made it &s;ea&s;onable&punc;
In the&s;e retirements the <HI>Brother</HI> pray'd,
and made a daily Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin, the
<HI>Si&s;ter</HI> read the Scriptures, and in their
Di&s;cour&s;es they were mutual.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, they lock'd them&s;elves up
every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> and kept the
whole Day as a Solemn Fa&s;t, neither
Eating or Drinking 'till about Four a
Clock in the Afternoon; where it might be
truly &s;aid of them both, as was &s;aid of <HI>Me|na&s;&s;ah,
That they humbled them&s;elves greatly be|fore
the Lord their God;</HI> and as the Scripture
above mentioned directed, they did it with
<HI>Fa&s;ting,</HI> with <HI>Weeping,</HI> and with <HI>Mourning.</HI></P>
<P>The young Man in particular, was a
Pattern for Penitents; and in an e&s;pecial
Manner he was afflicted, and continual|ly
reproach'd him&s;elf with having put off
his Preparation and Repentance formerly
'till the very Judgment was at the Door;
and with having been once before touch'd
with a like Sen&s;e of the Danger, but
growing cold and unconcern'd again, as
the Danger abated and went off: This
rob'd him of much of the Comfort of
<PB N="207" REF="218">
his pre&s;ent Application; and he continu|ally
upbraided him&s;elf with it, as if it
was a Te&s;t of his future in&s;incerity,
and it was very di&s;couraging to him;
he would al&s;o frequently expre&s;s himfelf
on that Head, how much it &s;hould be
con&s;ider'd by every one in &s;uch Ca&s;es,
never to fall back from their own Re|&s;olutions;
and how &s;ad a Token it was
of real Hypocri&s;y; and particularly,
how hard it would be for &s;uch People,
if ever they came to be true Penitents,
to believe them&s;elves &s;o, or to receive
the Comfort of their own Humiliati|ons.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s of his Mind he receiv'd
great A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Comforting
Di&s;cour&s;es, and excellent Example of his
Pious <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> who was now the Compani|on
of his be&s;t Hours, and his &s;upport in
his greate&s;t di&s;couragements.</P>
<P>She had given the fir&s;t Life to his Re|&s;olutions,
by hinting to him, that our
Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf was the Author
of that Parable of the Prodigal, and that
as it was &s;aid, introductory to the Para|ble
of the unju&s;t Judge, that he <HI>&s;peaks a
Parable to them to</HI> THIS END, <HI>that Men
ought always to Pray and not to faint;</HI> &s;o
that it might be &s;aid of the Parable of
the Prodigal, that he &s;pake a Parable,
<PB N="208" REF="219">
TO THIS END, that Men ought always
to return to God their Father, when
they are in di&s;tre&s;s, and not to decline
for its being late. She had upon all Oc|ca&s;ions
repeated to him &s;uch encourag|ing
Texts of Scripture as occur'd to her
to &s;upport his Re&s;olutions; and &s;he was
daily &s;earching the Bible for &s;uch Tex$s
of Scripture, as might be particularly
adapted to the&s;e Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>It happened, that under &s;ome of his
greate&s;t di&s;couragements, for he had many,
and mo&s;t of them beginning at the
Doubts he had upon his Mind, of his
own &s;incerity, and of his being accepted
becau&s;e of his having not applied him|&s;elf
to his Humiliation, till it plea&s;ed
God to bring the Terror of the Plague
upon him, and till the Judgment was,
as it were at the Door: I &s;ay under one
of the&s;e wor&s;t Dejections, his <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> thought
of another Example; Come, <HI>Brother,</HI> &s;ays
&s;he, I have another Scripture In&s;tance
for your Encouragement, where God ac|cepted
one of the wor&s;t Wretches that e|ver
was alive, and who never returned
till he was brought to the greate&s;t Ex|tremity,
a greater In&s;tance of Wicked|ne&s;s
never was in the World: Nor did
he ever think of returning, as we read
of, till God &s;truck him and brought
<PB N="209" REF="220">
him down to the lowe&s;t degree of Mi|&s;ery;
and yet upon his humbling him|&s;elf,
he was accepted: Will &s;uch an Ex|ample
Comfort you? <HI>&s;ays &s;he:</HI> I think,
&s;ays he, you were born to Comfort me,
Who was it? Here it is, &s;ays &s;he, take
it as it is recorded on purpo&s;e to encou|rage
Penitents under the wor&s;t Circum|&s;tances,
it is the Story of <HI>M$na&s;&s;ah,</HI>
the mo&s;t Wicked of all the Kings of
God's People, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 33. in the begin|ning
of the Chapter to the 7th Ver&s;e,
you have an account of his Wickedne&s;s;
&s;uch as the like was never in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>
before him; doing abominable Things,
prophaning God's Hou&s;e and his Al$$r,
Wi$ch$ra$$, Sorcery, and dealing with
the Devil, al&s;o, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. 'tis &s;aid, <HI>the Lord
&s;p$ke to him, but he would not hearken:</HI> So
that he re&s;i&s;ted even God him&s;elf, and
rejected the gracious Call of God to him
to Repent. This, <HI>Brother,</HI> was much
wor&s;e than what you call growing Cold
and Negligent, and letting your Sen&s;e
of Thir$$s wear off: Well, after this,
$span$. <HI>e the Lord brought upon them
the</HI> cant$$ns <HI>of the Ho&s;t of the King of A&s;&s;yria,
which $o$k Mna&s;&s;$$h a$$ng the thorns, and
bound him with oetters, and carried him to
$ab$lon.</HI> This was driving him, as you
call it, with a witne&s;s; he was pull'd
<PB N="210" REF="221">
down from a Throne to a Dungeon;
from a Crown of Gold and Chains of
Gold as Ornaments, to Chains of Iron
to Fetter and Bind him, as one kept for
Execution; but &s;ee ver. 12, 13. <HI>And when he
was in affliction, he be&s;ought the Lord his
God, and humbled him&s;elf greatly before the
God of his fathers. And prayed unto him, and
he was entreated of him, a$d heard his &s;uppli|cation,
and brought him again to Jeru&s;alem into
his own kingdom. Then Mana&s;&s;$h knew that
the Lord he was God.</HI> Now <HI>Brother,</HI> &s;ays
&s;he, what think you of all this? Tears
of Joy run down his Face while &s;he read
the Words of the two la&s;t Ver&s;es; and
when &s;he ask'd him at la&s;t what he
thought of it; think of it, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> my
Dear <HI>Si&s;ter!</HI> my happy Comforter! I think I
will never be di&s;courag'd more; and he
was in a great Degree as good as his
Word, for he was exceedingly encourag'd
by it upon all Occa&s;ions, had recour&s;e to
that Example, when his reflection upon
his late Repentance gave him any &s;ad
Thoughts.</P>
<P>But he leaves it as a &s;ea&s;onable Caution
for us, upon whom the like Circum&s;tance
of a National Vi&s;itation &s;eem to be com|ing;
that our Preparations may not be ad|journ'd
till the Judgment is upon us; for
that, tho' it may not be in effectual thro'
<PB N="211" REF="222">
God's Mercy for any one to repent then,
however late, yet that it will rob us of
great Comfort, make the Danger a Thou|&s;and
times more dreadful, and fill
us always with dark and di&s;couraging
Thoughts, and 'twill be very hard to bear
up the Mind under them.</P>
<P>He warns all Men by his own Ex|ample,
that when Preparations for Death
have been long put off, 'tis &s;o much the
harder to begin them at all, and the
Heart once harden'd by frequent delay|ing
and putting it off, is not ea&s;ily &s;often'd
to the &s;erious Work again; and when
it &s;hall at la&s;t be brought to go about
it heartily, it will yet go with a heavy
and afflicted Mind, and tho&s;e delays of
Repentance will be the mo&s;t abhorr'd
Things, even equal to the Sins that are
to be repented of; that nothing is more
certain, then that when People put off
tho&s;e Preparations to the la&s;t, God is of|ten
pleas'd in Ju&s;tice to deny the Gift of
Repentance in their Extremity, or at
lea&s;t for a great while, and &s;ometimes
the Comfort of it to the la&s;t Ga&s;p; but
this is a Digre&s;&s;ion: I proceed to the
Story of the Family before me.</P>
<P>The&s;e two happy Penitents went on
in this Cour&s;e for &s;ome time; &s;ome &s;hort
Di&s;cour&s;es which happened between them,
<PB N="212" REF="223">
cou'd they have been entirely pre&s;erv'd,
might have been very u&s;eful to others,
the following however, may not be un|profitable;
the <HI>Brother,</HI> it being during one

thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> we are under the Ap|prehen&s;ion

among us; pray let us &s;tate between
us, what is our Work upon that account
at this time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I under&s;tand $word$, <HI>Brother$</HI>
you would have us &s;tate what $word$ mean
by Preparations, for th$&s;e are the things
we talk much of, and others too <HI>when
they</HI> &s;peak of any &s;erious things, indeed
I have often ask'd my &s;elf, what I mean
by Preparations for the Plague?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and how did you an&s;wer
your own Que&s;tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I an&s;wer'd it as I heard
you mention it once to my <HI>Brother,</HI> and
I thought you had given a very right
account of it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that Preparations
for the Plague were Preparations for
Death, and that they ought to be under|&s;tood
&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but the Que&s;tion is
much the &s;ame then, (<HI>viz.</HI>) what is it
to make Preparations for Death? or what
<PB N="213" REF="224">
what Preparations are proper to be made
for Death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a hard Que&s;tion, <HI>Brother,</HI>
and requires a better Head than mine
to give an an&s;wer to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother,</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> that which is wor&s;e,
is that the Preparations I mean, are to
be &s;uppo&s;ed to be made, by a Man that

Wretch, for great Crimes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>The fir&s;t thing, <HI>Brother,</HI> I think

<P>And then trying the quallity

<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, there is a Bar

of that true Work of Preparation
for the Plague: Let none flatter them|&s;elves

pretend to be making Preparations for
the Plague, that is to &s;ay, for Death,
any other way than by &s;earching and try|ing
their ways and turning to the Lord,
with fa&s;ting, with weeping, and with
<PB N="217" REF="228">
mourning, that is to &s;ay, with &s;incere
Humiliation and Repentance, will but
mock and deceive them&s;elves, and will
find they have made no Preparations at
all.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t leave this pious Couple now a

<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e being ended, the &s;econd
<HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> began to con&s;ider that
it would be their lot to &s;tay in the City;
but being very anxious for their Elder
<HI>Brother,</HI> they re&s;olv'd to per&s;wade him
to go away, chiefly with re&s;pect to the
Confu&s;ion which they found he was in
about his eternal State: In the mean time
as they kept up their daily Conferences
and Fa&s;ts as before, they were every
day more and more Encourag'd and
Comforted, being fully given up to the
di&s;po&s;ing Will o$ Heaven, Iet it be
which way it would, whether for Life
or Death.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="235">
But to bring them to this gradually,
we mu&s;t go back to another of their
Di&s;cour&s;es upon this Subject in one of

<P>Dear <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> I thought we brought our

the Lord:</HI> I have had &s;ome difficulties
with my &s;elf upon this Work of turn|ing
to God; we re&s;olv'd it at our la&s;t
meeting into Repentance; and I think
that is plain in the Text we were up|on,
<HI>turn with fa&s;ting and weeping and mourn|ing.</HI></P>
<P>This I take to be Repentance; but is
there nothing to do be&s;ide? alas, we may
weep and mourn, but as that can make
no Compen&s;ation for our Sin, we mu&s;t
look farther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Si&s;ter,</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, there is more to
be done, but the Scripture is full and plain
even in that, for the Word, <HI>turn to the
Lord,</HI> implies, in my Judgment, flying
to him for Pardon; it is true, that
the manner of applying to God for
Pardon of our Sins, is not expre&s;s'd in
the Prophe&s;y of <HI>Joel;</HI> becau&s;e they were

hope to that Scripture, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 30. where
the Jaylor &s;ays, <HI>Sirs what mu&s;t I do to be

<SP>

<P>It is mo&s;t certain, <HI>Brother,</HI> that

they had re&s;olved at fir&s;t to be guid|ed
by, as the head of the Family, had
not talked of going a way till it was almo&s;t

no Provi&s;ion, either for leaving the Hou&s;e
and Family in Tru&s;t with any Body, or
&s;ecuring what in &s;uch Ca&s;es might be,
and was fit to be &s;ecur'd: They had
provided no Country Being, or Place to
retreat to; the Elder <HI>Brother</HI> indeed, had
a Hou&s;e of his own, and an E&s;tate with
<PB N="230" REF="241">
it as far off as <HI>Che&s;hire;</HI> but it was not
po&s;&s;ible to carry any thing of Goods or

had let it alone &s;o to the la&s;t, the ordinary

only been kept out of their Hou&s;e but
out of their Neighbourhood; no Bo|dy

where they liv'd; but as it was now the

le&s;s in mo&s;t parts of the City.</P>
<P>They had for &s;ometime left off to bury
the Dead in the u&s;ual Forms, and in the
Out-parts e&s;pecially, Carts were appointed
to go thro' the Streets between the Hours
of Twelve and Three in the Night,
with a Bell-man, Crying, <HI>Bring out your
Dead?</HI></P>
<P>It was not 'till the fir&s;t Week in
<HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> that this dreadful Sound was
heard within the Walls; and at fir&s;t it
was principally in tho&s;e Pari&s;hes which
were next the City Walls, on the Side
of <HI>Cripplogate</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate,</HI> and that Week
there died of all Di&s;ea&s;es above 4000.</P>
<P>Their Elder <HI>Brother,</HI> came in the Week

been at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e,</HI> or that Way,

Goods, and had met with &s;ome frightful

<P>While they were under the&s;e Debates,
for it held them there or four Days,
there came a Captain of a Ship up to the

Merchant under great Perplexity about
the encrea&s;es of the Plague, and he be|gan
him&s;elf to tell him, that he wonder'd
he had not remov'd his Family all this

<P>So I did indeed, and I told my

that had liv'd at <HI>Naples,</HI> where they &s;ay

<P>I was not &s;urpriz'd at that part

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She did lie, <HI>Sir,</HI> at <HI>Rotherhith,</HI> in

<P>Sit down again, <HI>Captain;</HI> Come
I'll propo&s;e it to my <HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI>
and hear what they &s;ay to it, for I con|fe&s;s
your Offer comes to me, as if it came
from Heaven, 'tis as if it was a Voice
from above, a Me&s;&s;age to &s;ave us all
<PB N="239" REF="250">
from the mo&s;t dreadful Condition that
ever Family was in; I wonder I &s;hould
never think of it before.</P>
<P>Upon this he call'd his <HI>Brother</HI> and
<HI>Si&s;ter;</HI> and gave them an account of the
<HI>Captain's</HI> Propo&s;al, and of his own Opini|on
of it: They both &s;aid the &s;ame, that
it &s;eem'd to be a merciful Di&s;po&s;ition
of Providence, for the Deliverance of the
whole Family; and the &s;econd <HI>Brother</HI> and
<HI>Si&s;ter</HI> receiv'd it with Acknowledgments
&s;uitable to their Opinion of it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the <HI>Merchant</HI> and the <HI>Captain</HI>
immediately entred into Mea&s;ures for the
putting it in Execution; and to this pur|po&s;e,
he cau&s;ed Beds and Bedding, Linnen
of all &s;orts; with all Kinds of Kitchen
Furniture, and all other Family Nece&s;|&s;aries,
to be pack'd up in Ca&s;es and Boxes
and Bales, as if for the U&s;e of Pa&s;&s;engers,
with all their Plate and Things of Value,
and had it fetch'd away by the Ships
long Boat, and another Boat which they
borrowed, for three Days together, not
&s;uffering the Ship's Men or any of them
to come on Shoar, but had it all put on
Board by his own Servants; at the &s;ame
time the Merchant cau&s;ed the Ship's Bills,
which we hung up on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> in|timating
that She was ready to take in
Goods for <HI>Italy,</HI> to be taken down; tho'
<PB N="240" REF="251">
if he had not, there was no great forward|ne&s;s
in any Merchants to Ship any Goods
at that time.</P>
<P>All the&s;e three Days the <HI>Captain</HI> took
to lay in a larger Store of Provi&s;ions,
and particularly, of Fre&s;h Provi&s;ions;
and fir&s;t he di&s;mi&s;s'd all the Men he had
hir'd for the Voyage, except tho&s;e who
were already actually on Board, who
were his Chief-Mate, Boat&s;wain, Carpen|ter
and Six Seamen or Fore ma&s;t Men;
and the&s;e he forbid to &s;et their Feet on
Shoar or on Board any other Ship on
pain of being turn'd off.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of this Embarkation, tho'
not material to the Subject in Hand; I
mean as to the religious Preparations for
the Plague: I yet cannot think proper
to omit, becau&s;e it may be a direction
for others to take the &s;ame happy Mea|&s;ures
in the like Danger, and perhaps
with as good Succe&s;s; for this, as you
will hear, &s;ucceeded very well.</P>
<P>The <HI>Captain</HI> was a good Agent Victu|aller,
he laid in a double quantity of
Bi&s;cuit, Meal, Beer, Beef, Peas, Fi&s;h, and
every thing u&s;ual in furni&s;hing a Ship
for a Voyage; but that was not all,
he put on Board a quantity of Hay,
and bought two Cows, making a Plat
Form for them in the Hold, which had
<PB N="241" REF="252">
vacancy enough: He bought a great
quantity of Fowls, and twelve Sheep; two
or three Sows with Pigs, and the like:
And in &s;hort, made Provi&s;ion to a Pro|$u&s;ion;
and this he did with &s;uch Expe|dition,
that every thing was on Board
before them.</P>
<P>The Ship was now fully ready for them
to go on Board, and the Boat was order'd
to come up to <HI>Tower Wharf,</HI> to take in
the Family as on the <HI>Wedne&s;day;</HI> when
on the Sabbath day in the Afternoon
their <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> was taken very Ill, which put
them all into a terrible Fright, &s;he con|tinued
exceeding Ill, and particularly,
Vomited violently all Monday, and they
made no doubt but it was the Plague.</P>
<P>She carry'd it with an extraordinary
Compo&s;u$e of Mind, meekly committing
her &s;elf into the Hands of him, on who&s;e
Mercy &s;he had &s;o long depended; in a
Word, &s;he &s;hew'd eminently the diffe|rence
between a Mind &s;olemnly Prepar'd
for Death, and which in earne&s;t had
long expected it; and a Thoughtle&s;s negli|gent
one, who had put the Evil day
far from him.</P>
<P>However, as her Di&s;temper was not
the Plague, &s;he &s;oon began to mend, her
Vomiting abated, and &s;he recover'd
Strength; but I mention it to ob&s;erve
<PB N="242" REF="253">
the Condition of her Elder <HI>Brother,</HI> upon
this Occa&s;ion: Now, and not till now,
he was thoroughly alarmed; he was fright|ed
and terrify'd before with the Danger
he was in; but now he look'd upon it
that God had &s;truck his Family, and
that they &s;hould all die of the Plague
very quickly.</P>
<P>He got no &s;leep that Night, when in
the middle of the Night, between Twelve
and One a Clock, he heard for the fir&s;t
time, that di&s;mal Cry, <HI>Bring out your
Dead!</HI> the Cart begining to go thro' the
Street where he liv'd, being the Pari&s;h
of St. <HI>Margaret Pattons,</HI> that very Night:
The Noi&s;e of the Bell, the doleful Cry
of the Bell-man, and the rumbling of
the Cart Wheels, you may &s;uppo&s;e, join'd
together to pre&s;ent to his Mind the mo&s;t
frightful Ideas, e&s;pecially Increa&s;ed by
the Apprehen&s;ions that the Plague was
already in his Hou&s;e, and that his own
<HI>Si&s;ter</HI> might perhaps be to be fetch'd out
by the Cart and the Bearers the next
Night or two at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>He got up and went to his <HI>Brothers</HI>'s
Chamber, thinking to awaken him, and
to &s;it down by his Bed-&s;ide; but was &s;ur|priz'd
to find no Body in the Room,
and that the Bed was not unmade; In
&s;hort, his <HI>Brother</HI> was up praying with
<PB N="243" REF="254">
his <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> and tho' he believed &s;he had
the Plague upon her, yet he would not
leave her, or &s;tir from her, but as Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
oblig'd him; but &s;at by her, com|forting
and &s;upporting her Mind, with
the Fruit of their former Experiences,
and reading comforting Scriptures to her;
thus, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> they were &s;pending the Night,
when the Elder <HI>Brother,</HI> calling his <HI>Brother</HI>
by Name, the Servant that attended, told
him, and he went out to him, and their
&s;hort and confus'd Di&s;cour&s;e, was to this
purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>Do not ask me, I cannot leave

<P>He had with much ado prevail'd on his
<HI>Brother,</HI> to re&s;olve upon going the next
Morning, and not to &s;tay for the Ship's
Boat, which was to come for them two
Days after, when offering to go into his
<HI>Si&s;ter</HI>'s Chamber again, the Servants met
<PB N="247" REF="258">
him &s;oftly at the Door, and told him
&s;he was fallen into a Sleep, with a little
Sweat; upon which he retir'd into his own
Chamber again: He waited four or five
Hours, and &s;till his <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> &s;lept mo&s;t
&s;weetly, upon which he lay down upon
his own Bed in his Clothes, and &s;lept
&s;everal Hours more, and &s;till his <HI>Si&s;ter</HI>
was not wak'd.</P>
<P>In a Word, &s;he &s;lept till near Nine a
Clock the next Morning, when &s;he wak'd
wonderfully refre&s;h'd, her Di&s;temper quite
abated, the Fever gone; and in a Word,
it appear'd that &s;he had not the lea&s;t
Symptoms of the Infection upon her, to
the inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy of the whole Fami|ly.</P>
<P>On the Day appointed the Boat came
up, and the Elde&s;t <HI>Brother</HI> with his two
Children and one Maid-Servant and a
Man-Servant, went on Foot thro' the
Street to <HI>Galley-Key,</HI> where, it being High-water,
the Boat came clo&s;e to the Shoar
and they went all away.</P>
<P>The next Day, the Boat being order'd
up again, the &s;econd <HI>Brother,</HI> the <HI>Si&s;ter</HI>
and another Maid-Servant, with an
antient Woman, that was formerly the
<HI>Si&s;ter</HI>'s Nur&s;e, went all off in the &s;ame
manner.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="259">
When they were all &s;afe on Board,
the <HI>Captain</HI> ask'd their leave to bring his
own Wife and one Child, a little Boy
of five Years old, and a Maid to be
with him al&s;o, which they all agreed
willingly to; and thus they were all Em|bark'd
together. This being the fir&s;t
Week in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> by which time the Bu|rials
in the City and Suburbs amounted
to no le&s;s than 4030 in all, of which
of the Plague 2817.</P>
<P>They left the Hou&s;e fa&s;ten'd up with
no Soul in it; but left the Care of guard|ing
it, to the ordinary Watch by Night,
and two poor Men, who by turns kept the
outer Door by day, took in Letters and
any &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s, as in that time of a
Ce&s;&s;ation of all Bu&s;ine&s;s, might happen;
the&s;e were particularly directed to take in
the <HI>Weekly Bill</HI> of Mortality, which, with
all Foreign Letters they order'd to be
&s;ent Weekly to a Hou&s;e at <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
and gave Orders at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to have
them brought to the Ship &s;ide, after they
had been Perfum'd and &s;prinkl'd with
<HI>Vinegar,</HI> and then &s;corch'd at the Fire, as
was then the U&s;age.</P>
<P>The Ship, as I ob&s;erv'd, lay at an
Anchor a little above <HI>Deptford,</HI> where
they continued about a Fortnight longer;
but finding by that time the dreadful
<PB N="249" REF="260">
Increa&s;e of the Plague, and that it came
on <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> from the other End of the
Town by the <HI>North Side</HI> of the City into
the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Aldgate, White Chappel</HI> and
<HI>Stepney,</HI> and particularly began to rage in
<HI>Wapping</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> and even down to
<HI>Blackwall;</HI> al&s;o, that &s;ome had died
of it in <HI>Rotherhith</HI> and in <HI>Deptford,</HI> they
found they &s;hould be, as it were, &s;urround|ed;
&s;o the <HI>Captain</HI> at their Reque&s;t,
weigh'd and Fell down the River, to a
Place between <HI>Black-Wall</HI> and <HI>Woolwich,</HI>
which they call <HI>Bugby's-Hole,</HI> being a
&s;ecure place for Ships to ride in.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;el they were in, was a Ship of
Force, carrying 16 Guns, but could car|ry
24; &s;o that they liv'd at large and
had room enough; the Merchant and
his Family had the great Cabbin and
Steerage to them&s;elves, with &s;ome Cabbins
built on purpo&s;e for his Maid-Servants
and Children in the Gun-Room; an
Appartment was built up out of the
great Cabbin for his <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> and her Nur&s;e
and Maid, and him&s;elf and his <HI>Brother</HI>
had each of them a large Cabbin built in
the Steerage, &s;o the re&s;t of the great Cab|bin
was their Dining Room: The <HI>Captain</HI>
had the Round-Hou&s;e and the little Room
before it, which they call the Cuddie, for
his Family, and the Quarter-Deck was
<PB N="250" REF="261">
their Parade or walking Place; over which
the <HI>Captain</HI> had caus'd an Auning to be built,
and cover'd it &s;o clo&s;e, both Top and
Sides, that it was like a great Hall.</P>
<P>They &s;oon found rea&s;on al&s;o to remove
the Place appointed for their Letters,
and order'd them to <HI>Woolwich,</HI> both the
Towns of <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Greenwich,</HI> being
forely Vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>Here they Rode with great Satisfaction,
for all the re&s;t of the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI>
when they receiv'd the la&s;t <HI>Weekly Bill</HI>
for the &s;aid Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which a|mounted
to no le&s;s than 7496, a fright|ful
Number indeed! and which was &s;till
dreadfully Increa&s;ing having Increa&s;'d
almo&s;t 2000, that very Week, not
reckoning &s;uch as died in the Towns of
<HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>This put the Merchant upon a new
Propo&s;al to the <HI>Captain,</HI> which was to go
quite away to Sea; for he was now in
&s;uch a dreadful Con&s;ternation on &s;everal
Accounts, that he was altogether as un|ea&s;y
as he was before he left his Hou&s;e
in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>While they thus lay in <HI>Bugsby's-Hole,</HI> the
<HI>Captain</HI> and the Merchant's &s;econd <HI>Brother,</HI>
with their Boat, had ventur'd down to
<HI>Woolwich,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to the uppper
end of the Town, but did not go on
<PB N="251" REF="262">
Shore, neither were the People of the
Town at fir&s;t willing to let them come
on Shore, not knowing whence they
came, or how they far'd on Board, and
they were the more wary, becau&s;e, be|&s;ides
the Town of <HI>Greenwich,</HI> the Plague
was raging at <HI>Black-Wall,</HI> al&s;o in all that
part of the Country, which contained
&s;everal Villages, all in <HI>Stepney</HI> and <HI>Brom|ley</HI>
Pari&s;hes, &s;uch as <HI>Black Wall, Poplar,
Lime-Hou&s;e, Bow, Old-Ford, Bethnal-Green,
Bromley, Mile-End;</HI> in the former of which
Pari&s;hes (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Stepney,</HI> including <HI>White-Chappel,</HI>
there died 1026 People that very
Week, and the next Week 1327.</P>
<P>However they an&s;wer'd their end at
<HI>Woolwich,</HI> which was fir&s;t to learn that
the Town was not yet Infected, except
two Hou&s;es at a little Di&s;tance towards
<HI>Greenwich,</HI> where three or four had died;
that the Market was yet pretty well
furni&s;h'd with Provi&s;ions; &s;o they got a
good Woman of the Town to buy &s;uch
Provi&s;ions for them, as they had Occa&s;ion
for, &s;uch as fre&s;h Butter, &s;ome Eggs and
a great Quantity of Garden Stuff, &s;uch
as the Sea&s;on afforded, with Apples in
abundance; all which was a great Relief
to them, having been more tied down
to Salt Meats, than agreed with them,
being &s;o differing from their u&s;ual way
<PB N="252" REF="263">
of living before; they got al&s;o fre&s;h Meat,
as Veal and Pork, and in a Word, were
very well &s;tor'd with refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>But by the next Market Day the
Plague was &s;o far got into the Town,
that the Country People came but very
thin to the Market, by which the quantity
of Provi&s;ions was le&s;&s;ened, and not to be
ea&s;ily had; nor did the Merchant care
to venture the Boat on Shore any more.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Captain</HI> made a little Voyage
in his Boat to <HI>Barking</HI> Creek, intending
to go up the &s;aid Creek to <HI>Barking</HI> Market;
but was inform'd by &s;ome of the Fi&s;her|men's
Smaks which lay at the Mouth of
the Creek, that the Plague was there
al&s;o; whether true or not, they did not
&s;tay to Inquire, but came back.</P>
<P>When they found this, the Merchant
grew impatient, and in &s;hort, would lie
there no longer; &s;o they Weigh'd and
went down the River to a Place call'd
<HI>Green-Hithe;</HI> but there being no Market
there, nor any great Store of Provi&s;ions,
and the <HI>Captain</HI> thinking their Riding there
not &s;o &s;afe as lower down, con&s;idering
how few Hands they had on Board he
propo&s;ed going as low as <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where
if it happen'd to over Blow, they might
get &s;ome Men from the Shore.</P>
<P>While they were con&s;idering this, they
<PB N="253" REF="264">
call'd with a Speaking-Trumpet to the
Shore for a Boat to come on Board, ac|cordingly
a Boat came off, but they wou'd
not let them come on Board till they
had enquir'd whether the Plague was
in the Town; nor would the Fellows
come on Board till they had enquir'd
whence the Ship come la&s;t; but after|wards
the Men in the Boat a&s;&s;uring them
that the Town was in perfect Health, and
the <HI>Captain</HI> a&s;&s;uring the Town Boat that
they came from <HI>Bugbys-Hole</HI> only, where
they had ridden three Weeks, that they
were all in perfect Health, and came down
lower becau&s;e they heard that the Plague
was at <HI>Black Wall</HI> and <HI>Woolwich.</HI> I &s;ay af|ter
this they became better acquainted.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o they had News that the
Plague was at <HI>Grave&s;-end,</HI> and as the People
&s;aid, at <HI>Chatham</HI> and <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> but it
&s;eems, as they were afterwards inform'd,
that News was not true; only that a
Rumour had &s;pread over the Country
to that purpo&s;e, a great while before it
was &s;o; however, this alter'd their Re|&s;olutions,
and they continued for the
pre&s;ent where they were; tho' this was
no Market Town, yet they got &s;ome fre&s;h
Provi&s;ions, and particularly &s;ent a Coun|try
Man with a little Cart and two
Hor&s;es to <HI>Dartford,</HI> a Market Town a|bout
<PB N="254" REF="265">
three Miles up the Country, and
which at that time was free from the
Infection; and there they &s;tor'd them|&s;elves
again fully.</P>
<P>But the Merchant was &s;till unea&s;y, for
he could not bear to lie any where with
the Ship, if the Plague was at any Town
beyond him; &s;o he made the <HI>Captain</HI> remove
the Ship again and fall down to <HI>Grave&s;-end,</HI>
and pa&s;&s;ing the Town he came to an
Anchor below a Place, which is &s;ince
call'd the <HI>New Tavern,</HI> being as far as
the Cu&s;tom Officers would let him pa&s;s
without clearing.</P>
<P>Here they were told that the Town
of <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> was perfectly clear of the
Plague, but as they had been told o|therwi&s;e
at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> he would not &s;uf|fer
the Boat to &s;tir on Shore, or call any
Boat to come off to them, but made &s;hift
with &s;uch Provi&s;ions as they had.</P>
<P>While they Rode here, they &s;uffer'd a
violent Storm of Wind, in which they
were in &s;ome Danger of driving from
their Anchors, and going on Shore;
and tho' there was no doubt of &s;av|ing
their Lives, yet it put them in a
very great Fright, lea&s;t they &s;hould be
forc'd from this little Sanctuary (the Ship)
where they had been hitherto &s;o comfort|ably
&s;helter'd.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="266">
However, as they Rode out the Storm
with &s;afety, and got over the Danger,
the <HI>Captain</HI> told his Merchant &s;eriou&s;ly,
that he thought it was not &s;afe to Ride
&s;o low with &s;o few Hands; that if he
was willing to let him go on Shore and
get three or four good Seamen, which
he believed might be ea&s;ily done, he
would then clear the Ship at the Fort, and
fall down into the <HI>Hope,</HI> or go to the
<HI>Buoy</HI> on the <HI>Nore,</HI> where he thought he
might Ride as &s;afe as where they did;
but if not, that then it would be a bet|ter
way to go up to the upper End of
<HI>Long-Reach</HI> and Ride there, where he be|liev'd
there lay five or &s;ix Ships in the
&s;ame Circum&s;tances, and on the &s;ame Ac|count
with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Merchant was utterly again&s;t go|ing
on Shore at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> but e&s;pecially
again&s;t taking any more Seamen on
Board; but would have had the <HI>Captain</HI>
have &s;tood away for <HI>Harwich,</HI> but upon
&s;econd Thoughts, as it had been &s;aid that
the Plague came over fir&s;t from <HI>Holland;</HI>
&s;o to go to <HI>Harwich,</HI> would be ju&s;t to go
in the way of it, the Packet-Boats con|tinuing
to go and come between that
Place and <HI>Holland;</HI> and that they did not
know but that <HI>Harwich</HI> might be Infect|ed,
<PB N="256" REF="267">
and then they were left to the wide
World.</P>
<P>In &s;hort they agreed at la&s;t to come
up the River again, not to <HI>Green-Hithe,</HI>
where they lay before, but to the up|per
part of that which they call <HI>Long-Reach,</HI>
which is about three Miles nearer
<HI>London</HI> than <HI>Green-Hithe.</HI> Here they had
very good Riding and &s;afe, though &s;ome|times
blu&s;tering Weather: Here lay &s;ix
other Ve&s;&s;els, four above them, and two
below them; and tho' they did not go
on Board one another, yet they &s;oon be|came
acquainted with one another, and
conver&s;ed with one another upon the par|ticular
Circum&s;tances of each Ship, and
the publick State of Things al&s;o; and
they found pre&s;ently, that they were all
Outward Bound Ships, but had not their
Loading fully in, that they were, as it
were, embargo'd by the general Calami|ty,
that the <HI>Captains</HI> had all their Fa|milies
on Board, and mo&s;t of them had
other Families on Board al&s;o, and that
they had fallen down there for &s;afety
from the Plague, and it was to their
particular Satisfaction, that they under|&s;tood
that they were all very Healthy &s;o
far, and that there had not the lea&s;t Ap|pearance
of Illne&s;s been among them.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="268">
They had not lain here above three
Days, but the Head-mo&s;t Ship, that is to
&s;ay, that which &s;ay at the upper end of the
<HI>Roach,</HI> made a Signal to the re&s;t, which
this Ship did not under&s;tand; he found
that the re&s;t an&s;wer'd it, and tho' he was
going to call to the next Ship to know
the meaning of it, when the Head-mo&s;t
Ship's Boat came off with the Ship's Mate
on Board, and lying upon their Oars,
they Hal'd the <HI>Captain,</HI> who an&s;wering,
the Mate, told him his <HI>Captain</HI> order'd
him to acquaint them, that the next Day
was the Day that the Six Ships had ap|pointed
ever &s;ince they Rode there in
Company, to keep as a Weekly Fa&s;t on
the pre&s;ent &s;ad Occa&s;ion, in order to beg
of God to pre&s;erve them from the Pe&s;ti|lence;
and that they &s;hould be glad the&s;e
would plea&s;e to join with them in it.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Captain</HI> an&s;wer'd in the Name of
him&s;elf and all that were on Board his
Ve&s;&s;el, that they would join in it with all
their Hearts, and return'd Thanks to
the <HI>Captain</HI> of the fir&s;t Ship, for com|municating
it to him, de&s;iring to know
the time they begun and ended: The
Officer in the Boat told them that they
began at eight a Clock, and re&s;olv'd not
to eat or drink till &s;ix in the Evening;
accordingly they kept a mo&s;t religious
<PB N="258" REF="269">
Day of Fa&s;ting and Humiliation on Board
this Ship; but having no Mini&s;ter on
Board, they made it an Act of private
Devotion only, except we &s;hall call it
Family Devotion: The <HI>Captain</HI> and his
Family kept them&s;elves retir'd the whole
time within the <HI>Round-Hou&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. And not
one of them was &s;een all the Day.</P>
<P>Our Family, of which we are particu|larly
treating, and therefore call them
&s;o, did the like; but the Elder <HI>Brother</HI>
was &s;till &s;o confus'd in his Thoughts, and
had &s;uch a re&s;erv'd Melancholly upon
him, all the time, that he could do little
more than read a Sermon or two out of a
Book to his Servants, and then retir'd
him&s;elf into his particular Cabbin, where he
&s;pent his Time as well as he could; but as
he afterwards &s;aid, very uncomfortably to
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;econd <HI>Brother,</HI> and the <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> join'd
together in the private Devotion of that
Day, and &s;pent it as they us'd to do
their u&s;ual Fa&s;ts; namely, in reading
the Scriptures and private Comforting
one another, and endeavouring to give
them&s;elves up to the di&s;po&s;ing of God's
good Providence, and in praying with one
another, of which more by and by.</P>
<P>About three Days after this, which was
the 6th of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1665 they receiv'd the
<PB N="259" REF="270">
<HI>Weekly Bill</HI> of Mortallity, being from the
29th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to the 5th of <HI>Sept.</HI> in which
the Number of the Dead was 8252, for
one Week only, whereof of the Plague
and Spotted-Fever 7145. This was a
frightful Account, and particularly to
them; becau&s;e the gro&s;s of the Numbers
that died, were in the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> part of the
City, and in <HI>Southwark</HI> &s;ide, where at fir&s;t
they had been longe&s;t without the Infec|tion;
and in &s;hort, that it &s;eem'd to draw
a pace towards them.</P>
<P>This fill'd them all with heavine&s;s, and
as by the help of Speaking-Trumpets, they
now convers'd freely with all the other
Ships, and all tho&s;e Ships with one another,
The Merchant who&s;e mind was &s;till un|ea&s;y,
caus'd the <HI>Captain</HI> to call with his
Trumpet to the re&s;t of the Ships, and
to de&s;ire that the <HI>Captains</HI> of all the Ships
a Head, would come to their <HI>Round-Hou&s;e</HI>
Windows, and that the <HI>Captains</HI> of the
two Ships a Stern would come to the
<HI>Fore-Ca&s;tle</HI> of their Ships, for he had
&s;omething to propo&s;e to them, for the
Common good of them all.</P>
<P>Accordingly they came, and the <HI>Cap|tain,</HI>
in the Name of his chief Owner
who was on Board, &startq;Told them how
dreadfully the Plague was Increa&s;ed,
and how the Weight of it was all at
<PB N="260" REF="271">
the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> part of the Town, and par|ticularly,
that the Towns of <HI>Greenwich,
Woolwich, Black-Wall, We&s;t-Ham,</HI> and
<HI>Barking,</HI> were all Infected, be&s;ides other
Towns on both Sides of them, which
they yet had had no Account of; that
in &s;hort they &s;hould be &s;urrounded
with it on every Side, and &s;hould not
be able to get Provi&s;ions on Shore,
without danger of being Infected; and
that &s;ince they were all, ble&s;&s;ed be God,
in perfect Health at pre&s;ent, and while
they had &s;ufficient Provi&s;ions on Board,
his Advice was, that they &s;hould join
all together, and by Con&s;ent put out to
Sea, and Sail to &s;uch other Port in
<HI>England,</HI> or if need were, in <HI>Ireland,</HI>
where they might be furni&s;hed with
Provi&s;ions and Ride with &s;afety: That
his Merchant a&s;&s;ur'd them he would
&s;tand by them and a&s;&s;i&s;t them, if they
would agree together to &s;tand by one
another; and that as they were &s;even
Sall of Ships in Company all of good
Force, they &s;hould be able to Force
the People wherever they &s;hould come,
to furni&s;h them with Provi&s;ions for
their Money, or to go on Shore and
dwell at large, as they found conveni|ent,
till this terrible Judgment &s;hould
be overpa&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="272">
The <HI>Captains</HI> unanimou&s;ly agreed, that
it was a very good Propo&s;al, and two
of them gave a full and free Con&s;ent
immediately; they two having Authori|ty
enough in them&s;elves and having none
of their Owners Families on Board, or
that if they had, they heard the Offer
and con&s;ented to it: The other <HI>Captains</HI>
an&s;wer'd, That they had every one of
them &s;everal Families of their Owners,
and Merchants on Board, and they would
con&s;ult with them and give their an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Accordingly having call'd their &s;aid
Owners together; and advi&s;ed about it,
&s;ome of them agreed to it, and others
&s;eem'd rather not to be re&s;olute enough
than to differ from it, the Women be|ing
afraid of the Sea at that time of the
Year; however their Debates took up a
great deal of Time, &s;o that it was ne|ver
fully agreed to.</P>
<P>In this Interval the dreadful height
which the Plague was come to, may be
judg'd of in the following Particulars, for
three Weeks only.</P>

Thus that dreadful Affair &s;tood at
that time, and the&s;e three di&s;mal Weeks
were worn out in Con&s;ultations and
un&s;teady Re&s;olutions; the poor Ladies
being both afraid to &s;tay, and afraid to
go away: At length, the 29th of <HI>Septem|ber,
(Michaelmas-day)</HI> they were &s;urpriz'd
in the Morning early, to hear the Head|mo&s;t
Ship Fire five Guns, and looking
out, they found &s;he had &s;pread her An|tient
and Pendants, and all look'd with a
Face of Joy; This being indeed &s;o unu&s;ual
at a time of &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s, they began to
call to one another with their Speaking-Trumpets,
to know what the Occa&s;ion
of it was, when they &s;aw a Boat come
off from the Headmo&s;t Ship to give them
an account of Things.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Boat came on to every
Ship, and at a Di&s;tance, calling to them
one by one, as they row'd by, told them
that their <HI>Captain</HI> had receiv'd the <HI>Bill</HI> of
<HI>Mortallity</HI> for the la&s;t Week, and two
Letters, with an Account that the Plague
was abated in an extraordinary Manner,
and that the Number of Burials was De|creas'd
near 2000.</P>
<P>This was matter of Joy &s;ufficient in|deed
to them all, and they all fir'd their
Guns, and drank to one anothers Health,
as well as they could at that di&s;tance,
<PB N="264" REF="276">
and in hopes the Di&s;temper would go
on to abate, they laid a&s;ide their Thoughts
of going all to Sea, as they had intend|ed
to do.</P>
<P>Nor did their hopes of the gradual
A batement of the Di&s;temper di&s;appoint
them, for the next Week after that, the
<HI>Bills</HI> decrea&s;ed 740, and the next 652, and
the third Week 1849; &s;o that the Num|bers
of Burials between the 19th of <HI>Sept.</HI>
and the 17th of <HI>Octob.</HI> were decrea&s;ed
from 8297 to 3219, and from 4 Pari&s;hes
being clear of the Plague to 16 Pari&s;hes,
and the very next Week after, it decrea&s;ed
1413 more, and 26 Pari&s;hes were entirely
clear of the Infection in the City only.</P>
<P>Any one will conclude, that from this
happy Decrea&s;e, they were greatly en|courag'd,
and indeed they had rea&s;on;
for notwith&s;tanding the Care they had
taken, and the happy retir'd Condition
they were in, even as it were &s;eparated
from all Mankind, yet it was a very
di&s;mal View they had of what might
happen to be their Lot; for they were
as it was, &s;urrounded with the general
Affliction; not only the City was thus
terribly Vi&s;ited, but all the Market Towns
and Towns of Note on both &s;ides the
River, and a great way into the Coun|try
were more or le&s;s Infected; as <HI>Rum|ford,
<PB N="265" REF="277">
Barking, Grayes,</HI> and the Villages a|bout
on the <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Side, and <HI>Greenwich,
Woolwich, Dartford Grave&s;end,</HI> and the Ci|ty
of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> with the Towns of <HI>Stroud</HI>
and <HI>Chattam,</HI> adjoining on the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI>
Side: So that they had but one Cour&s;e
to take, which was that which they had
been Con&s;ulting upon: Namely, of put|ting
out to Sea, and going to the North
round <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Ireland,</HI> which was, at
be&s;t, a long, and con&s;idering it was Win|ter,
a dangerous Voyage.</P>
<P>But now they were in great hopes
of a compleat Deliverance, for every
Week, <HI>as above,</HI> the Plague abated, and
they began to &s;ee the Boats pa&s;s and re|pa&s;s
as u&s;ual, to and from <HI>London;</HI> and
&s;everal Ve&s;&s;els loaden with Corn from the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> went up to Mar|ket,
venturing in hopes of a good Price;
as al&s;o Coa&s;ting Ve&s;&s;els from the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> with Butter and Chee&s;e, came
up in con&s;iderable Numbers; &s;o that
Trade &s;eem'd to be re&s;tor'd, and the
People were not &s;o afraid of one another
as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>However, they continued where they
were all of them, and agreed, that they
would not &s;uffer any Boat to come on
Board them from any place what&s;oever,
or any of their Company to go on Shore,
<PB N="266" REF="278">
or on Board any other Ve&s;&s;el, till they
found things &s;till better: And in this
Cautious manner they liv'd out the whole
Month of <HI>November;</HI> by which time the
Di&s;temper was &s;o far abated in <HI>London,</HI>
that the Burials for the whole Week,
amounted to but 428, whereof of the
Plague but 210; abundance of Pari&s;hes
entirely clear of the Plague, and but
24 dead of it in the whole City.</P>
<P>During this happy Decrea&s;e of the
Burials, tho' they kept their Re&s;olutions
as to the going up to the City; yet they
went on Shoar with their Boats frequently
to <HI>Purfleet</HI> and to <HI>Greenhith,</HI> and to other
unfrequented Places, to get fre&s;h Provi|&s;ions;
Butter, Fowls, Eggs, and &s;uch like;
al&s;o to a little Town call'd <HI>Rainham,</HI>
to which there is a &s;mall Creek that their
Boats could go up in, and where they
employ'd a Butcher to Kill &s;ome Sheep
on purpo&s;e for them; I mean for all the
Ships, and where they got Information
how the Infection was in the Country;
where they found that as it was later
coming among them there, &s;o it was
not &s;o much abated in Proportion in the
Country as in <HI>London;</HI> and this made them
the more Cautious.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as they were thinking of go|ing
up to <HI>London,</HI> they were a little al|larm'd
<PB N="267" REF="279">
with what might indeed be rea|&s;onably
expected: Namely, That the
People flocking on all hands to <HI>London</HI>
by the Nece&s;&s;ity of Bu&s;ine&s;s, pro&s;pect of
Gain, or other Things, they would come
thither too ha&s;tily, and catch the Di|&s;temper,
before it was quite gone; and
indeed &s;o it was, for the very fir&s;t Week
of <HI>November,</HI> when the Plague was De|crea&s;ed
to 1031 <HI>per</HI> Week, it Increa&s;ed a|gain
400 in one Week; and &s;o again the
fir&s;t and &s;econd Week in <HI>December,</HI> when
it was fallen as above to 210, it Increa|&s;ed
again, almo&s;t a Hundred.</P>
<P>This made them more Cautious, and
whereas before they were for coming up
in the Ships Boats to <HI>London.</HI> Now they
alter'd their Mea&s;ures, and re&s;olv'd to
Weigh their Anchors and come up in
the Ships as they were, and come for the
fir&s;t time no farther than to <HI>Deptford Reach,</HI>
where they would continue 'till they
heard how Things went.</P>
<P>Accordingly they Weigh'd from <HI>Long-Reach,</HI>
and having good Weather, came
all together into the lower End, of what
they call now <HI>Limehou&s;e-Reach,</HI> a little a|bove
<HI>Deptford;</HI> here they came to an An|chor,
Mooring their Ships two and two,
clo&s;e a Board one another; whereas they
lay before &s;ingle and &s;eparate one from
<PB N="268" REF="280">
another. And now they began to be bet|ter
acquainted, to Vi&s;it one another, and
Congratulate their Deliverance, and be
thankful al&s;o, <HI>that I am to &s;uppo&s;e,</HI> to their
great Deliverer for their Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>While they continued here, the Fa|mily
I am &s;peaking of, &s;ent &s;ome of their
Servants to Town, to Open and Air the
Hou&s;e, make Fires in the Rooms, Air
and Warm the Beds, dry the Linnen, and
the like; and particularly, the Merchant,
the Elder <HI>Brother,</HI> who had been acquain|ted
with &s;uch Things abroad, cau&s;ed all
the Hangings in the Hou&s;e to be taken
down, and all, except Tape&s;try, to be
Burnt; the Younger <HI>Brother,</HI> would have
had them only Bak'd or Wa&s;h'd in <HI>Vine|gar,</HI>
and dried very near the Fire; but
he was po&s;itive to have them Burnt, as
what he &s;aid might retain an Infectious
Air; tho' they were not &s;ure any &s;uch
Air was in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus after almo&s;t four Months ab&s;ence,
all things being prepar'd within Doors, and
the whole Pari&s;h which their Hou&s;e &s;tood
in, having been &s;everal Weeks free from
the Plague, they returned to their Habi|tation,
Sound and in Health, their Mea|&s;ures
for Preparation, as well as for Pre|&s;ervation,
being &s;uch, as we may ju&s;tly
recommend to the Pactice of others, if
<PB N="269" REF="281">
the like Vi&s;itation &s;hould come upon us
as we have but too much rea&s;on to
fear it may.</P>
<P>But I cannot leave this Subject with|out
returning to the ble&s;&s;ed Couple, the
<HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> who&s;e Preparations for
Death are as Remarkable and Exem|plar,
as the Preparations of the other were
for Life; and which, I hope I may with
more earne&s;tne&s;s than ordinary, recom|mend
for the Practice of all &s;uch who are
apprehen&s;ive of the &s;ame Judgment, and
who de&s;ire to be &s;upported with the &s;ame
Courage, and upon the &s;ame religious
Foundation.</P>
<P>From the time that the Elder <HI>Brother,</HI>
who we call the <HI>Merchant,</HI> accepted the
Offer of the <HI>Captain</HI> of the Ship, they
&s;eem'd to be entirely Pa&s;&s;ive in the
Matter of removing, or not removing,
leaving it wholly to Providence, and
their <HI>Brother</HI>'s Direction only; indeed
they look'd upon the <HI>Captain</HI>'s unexpect|ed
Motion for it, to be &s;omething like
a Call from Heaven to them, to come out
of the Danger, and therefore when they
found that Particular in it, which was
not related to them at fir&s;t, they clos'd
willingly with the Offer.</P>
<P>While they were in the Ship, they con|tinued
their particular Conver&s;ations upon
<PB N="270" REF="282">
the Subject of Death, and their Fa&s;ts twice
a Week as before; tho' they had not &s;o
good Convenience for their Retirement:
They were compo&s;edly Chearful, and as
they were fully re&s;ign'd, and that upon
a good and &s;olid Foundation, to the
di&s;po&s;itions of Providence; &s;o they left all
the other Things, &s;uch as removing from
one Place to another, down the River
and up the River, wholly to the Direc|tion
of their <HI>Brother</HI> the <HI>Merchant.</HI></P>
<P>This was the &s;weet and happy Con&s;e|quence
of a &s;erious Preparation; which I
cannot therefore but earne&s;tly recom|mend
to every Chri&s;tian's Con&s;ideration,
as that alone which will Compo&s;e them
and make them pre&s;ent to them&s;elves in
the greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s, that can be po&s;&s;ible
to fall upon them, and in all the Dangers
of a general Infection.</P>
<P>It may on the contrary be ob&s;erv'd
of the fir&s;t <HI>Brother,</HI> (tho' a religious
Man too in his Degree) yet that hav|ing
put off the Evil Day, and endeavour'd
to keep off the Apprehen&s;ions of it from
his Mind, he had likewi&s;e put off his
Preparations, as well of one &s;ort as of an|other,
either for Soul or Body; and what
was the Con&s;equence? his Pa&s;&s;ions, not
his Piety were Agitated when the Hour
came upon him; he was in a continual
<PB N="271" REF="283">
hurry of Mind, and in a terrible
Fright, even to Amazement and Di&s;|compo&s;ure:
He thought him&s;elf &s;ecure
no where, and he made all their Re|&s;traints
when he was in the Ship, &s;o
much the more &s;evere by his Con&s;tant
unea&s;ine&s;s, lea&s;t the Infection &s;hould reach
them. He would not have had the Ship
have lain at <HI>Long-Reach,</HI> becau&s;e he heard
the Plague was at <HI>Dartford,</HI> tho' the
Town of <HI>Dartford</HI> lay three or four Miles
off in the Country, and up a Creek or Ri|ver,
which few Boats went up or came
down, and none near to them; for they
lay near a Mile below the Creek: He was
al&s;o afraid in the <HI>Hope,</HI> becau&s;e he heard it
was at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> tho' no Boat came near
them, and he would not let any of the
Men go on Shoar, no not in the Mar&s;hes
where there were no Towns, &s;o much as
to Buy Things that they wanted of the
Farmers. His Mind was al&s;o full of
Horror, $word$ when he $ead the <HI>Bills</HI> of
<HI>Mortallity</HI> his Fle&s;h would tremble, and
he would fall into &s;uch Agonies as can
hardly be de&s;crib'd: And $hus &s;tood the
Difference between the Prepar'd and the
Un-prepar'd, <HI>Let us chu&s;e $word$ our &s;elves!</HI>
God grant that every &s;incere Chri&s;tian
may have his Eyes up to him in all
&s;uch Ca&s;es, and prepare his Mind by a
<PB N="272" REF="284">
&s;incere Repentance for all their Sins, and
a re&s;olv'd and &s;teddy giving them&s;elves
up to the Divine di&s;po&s;al; then they
&s;hall experience that happy Truth, that
<HI>he &s;hall not be afraid of Evil Tidings, who&s;e
Heart is fixed tru&s;ting in the Lord.</HI></P>
