<HEAD>The VICAR and <HI>Mo&s;ei.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AT the &s;ign of the Hor&s;e old Spinuext of cour&s;e,</L>
<L>Each night took his pipe and his pot.</L>
<L>O'er a jorum of nappy, quite plea&s;ant and happy,</L>
<L>Was plac'd the canonical &s;ot;</L>
<L>The evening was dark, when in came the clerk,</L>
<L>With reverence due and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>Fir&s;t &s;troak'd his cravat, then twirl'd round his hat,</L>
<L>And bowing pre&s;err'd his petition.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'm come, &s;ir, &s;ays he, to beg, look d'ye &s;ee,</L>
<L>Of your rove end wor&s;hip and glory,</L>
<L>To inter a po$r baby, with as much &s;peed as may be,</L>
<L>And I'll walk with the lanthern befo$e you,</L>
<L>The body well bury, but pray where's the hurry,</L>
<L>Why Lord, &s;ir, the corp&s;e it does &s;tay,</L>
<L>You fool hold your peace, &s;ince miracles cea&s;e,</L>
<L>A corp&s;e Mo&s;es can't run away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Mo&s;es he &s;mil'd, crying, &s;ir, a &s;mall child,</L>
<L>Cannot longer delay your intention,</L>
<L>And I &s;wear by St. Paul, a child that is &s;mall,</L>
<L>Can never enlarge its dimen&s;ions.</L>
<L>Bring Mo&s;es &s;ome beer, and bring me &s;ome, d'ye hear,</L>
<L>For I hate to be call'd from my liquor,</L>
<L>Come Mo&s;es the King, tis a &s;candalous thing</L>
<L>Such a &s;ubject &s;hould be but a Vicar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Mo&s;es he &s;poke, &s;ir, tis pu&s;t twelve o'clock,</L>
<L>Be&s;ides there's a terrible &s;hower,</L>
<L>Why Mo&s;es you elf, &s;ince the clock has &s;truck twelve,</L>
<L>I'm &s;ure it can never &s;trike more.</L>
<L>Be&s;ides, my dear friend, to this le&s;&s;on attend,</L>
<L>Which to &s;ay and to &s;wear I'll be bold,</L>
<L>That the corp&s;e, &s;now or rain, can't endanger, tis plain,</L>
<L>Tho' perhaps you or <HI>I</HI> may catch cold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Mo&s;es went on, &s;ir the clock has &s;truck one,</L>
<L>Pray ma&s;ter look up at the hand,</L>
<L>Why it ne'er can &s;trike le&s;s, tis a folly to pre&s;s</L>
<L>A man for to go that can't &s;tand;</L>
<L>At length has and cloak Old Orthodox took,</L>
<L>But fir&s;t cram'd his jaws with a quid,</L>
<L>Each tipt of his gill, for fear they &s;hould chill,</L>
<L>Then &s;tagger'd away &s;ide by &s;ide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When come to the g$ave, the clerk hum'd a &s;tave,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t the &s;urplice was wrapt round the prie&s;t,</L>
<L>So droll was the figure of Mo&s;es and Vicar,</L>
<L>That the pari&s;h &s;till talk of the je&s;t;</L>
<L>Good people let's pray,&mdash;put the corps $other way,</L>
<L>Or perchance I$ll all over it &s;tumble,</L>
<L>It is be&s;t to take care, tho' the &s;ages delare,</L>
<L>A Mortuum Capuit can't tumble.</L>
<L>Woman that's born of man&mdash;that's wrong, the leafs torn,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O man that as born of a woman.</L>
<L>$an't continue an hour, but's down like a flower,</L>
<L>You &s;ee, Mo&s;es, Death &s;pareth no man;</L>
<L>Here Mo&s;es do look, what a confounded book,</L>
<L>Sure the letters are ture turn'd up&s;ide down,</L>
<L>Such a &s;candalous print, &s;ure the devil is in't,</L>
<L>That this ba&s;ket &s;hould print for the crown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Prithee Mo&s;es you read, for I can't proceed,</L>
<L>And bury the corp&s;e in my &s;tead,&mdash;Amen! Amen!</L>
<L>Why Mo&s;es you're wrong, pray hold &s;till your tongue,</L>
<L>You've taken the tail for the head;</L>
<L>O where's thy &s;ting Death? put the corp&s;e in the earth,</L>
<L>For, believe me, tis terrible weather,</L>
<L>So the corp&s;e was interr'd, without praying a word,</L>
<L>And away they both &s;tagger'd together.</L>
