<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE fate of this little comedy, on its fir&s;t appear|ance, was extremely &s;ingular. After having been very favourably received the two fir&s;t nights, a violent attempt was made to prevent its exhibition on the third. The pretence for this determined condemnation of the piece was, that it contained not only per&s;onal, but even national, reflections. The author had the greate&s;t abhorrence of both. The piece was written &s;everal years ago; the very names of the per&s;ons who &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves aggrieved, were unknown to him; and &s;o far from intending to ca&s;t an illiberal reflection on the Iri&s;h nation, it was evidently his main de&s;ign to vindi|cate the gentlemen of that country from the reproach de&s;ervedly incurred by worthle&s;s adventurers and out|ca&s;ts. The gentlemen of Ireland appeared the foremo&s;t in his defence. The author is truly &s;en&s;ible of their candour on this occa&s;ion, and is &s;o con&s;cious of the pu|rity of his own intentions, which he doubts not will appear on the peru&s;al of the piece, that he has ven|tured to in&s;cribe it to one of the mo&s;t eminent charac|ters of that kingdom.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>_WELL, once more welcome to Lon|don! Welcome, for a &s;hort week at lea&s;t, days of ea&s;e and nights of plea|&s;ure! What? In the dumps, Charles? Prithee, throw off that mu&s;ty col|lege countenance. You breathe the air of dear Covent-Garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So much the wor&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Carel.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So much the wor&s;e? So much the bet|ter, you mean, Charles. Is not this chearful &s;quare beyond the doll gloom of a melancholy
<PB N="2" REF="8">
quadrangle? and the gay appearance of every one you meet, a more plea&s;ing &s;ight, than a few &s;o|lemn faces in &s;tarched bands and grizel wigs? But what can be the matter with you? I never knew you quarrel with jollity before. You were fretful and out of humour all the way upon the road; but there your unaccountable gravity only lulled us to &s;leep; but now, in the name of all that's happy and chearful, awake, man! and be the &s;ame jovial airy <HI>Knowell</HI> you u&s;ed to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Frank, that I am as fond of jollity as you are: but I mu&s;t own, that our pre|&s;ent excur&s;ion, and our late frequent journies to town, I have particular rea&s;ons to di&s;like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What rea&s;ons?&mdash;You are certainly the odde&s;t compound that ever made up one man. One minute, all alive and merry; the next, <HI>tcute &agrave; la mort</HI>. Now would I lay ten to one that little &s;lut of a &s;i&s;ter of mine, that Polly, has done &s;omething to vex you. You have be-rhimed her in &s;ome woeful madrigal, and &s;he has taken no notice of it: for nothing but love could &s;ink a young fellow of &s;o much plea&s;antry into &s;uch low &s;pirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, one thing more, and but one per|haps, could have this effect on me. Suppo&s;e now all my unea&s;ine&s;s &s;hould ari&s;e from friend&s;hip, from my friend&s;hip for you, Frank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From your friend&s;hip for me? Impo&s;&s;i|ble. For, without flattery, there is not a man in the world to whom I &s;hould &s;o &s;oon wi&s;h to be of &s;ervice. Be quick, and clear up this my&s;tery, and let me know in plain Engli&s;h the cau&s;e of all this di&s;quietude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Carele&s;s, I never objected to any &s;chemes of mirth and jollity, nay, have often propo&s;ed them my&s;elf. I am a young man as well
<PB N="3" REF="9">
as you, love mirth as well as you, and enjoy my plea&s;ures as heartily: but I cannot bear to &s;ee the man whom I love be&s;t in the world, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter I am doatingly fond of, and to whom I have rea&s;on to think, I am not indifferent &mdash;&mdash;I cannot bear I &s;ay to &s;ee that man betrayed by the goodne&s;s of his heart into ruin, and falling a prey to &s;harpers and pickpockets!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What can all this mean? Sharpers and pickpockets!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hard words, I mu&s;t confe&s;s: but for my part, I &s;ee no difference between a cheat at the orange barrow, or the hazard-table; nor have I more contempt for a poor rogue in rags than a ra&s;cal in embroidery. To be plain with you, Frank, I believe the&s;e new friends of ours, the&s;e three men, to meet whom was the chief rea&s;on that brought us to town, are no better than arrant &s;harpers; who have a mind for a few throws at your e&s;tate, and will take care to &s;ecure the odds on their &s;ide.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Away with the&s;e idle and ungenerous &s;u&s;|picions, for &s;hame, Charles. They are three as hearty hone&s;t fellows as any in the world. Be&s;ides, they are our fellow-countrymen, you know. They are of the nation, honey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>National reflections are always mean and &s;candalous: but it is owing to &s;uch men as the&s;e that &s;o much unde&s;erved &s;candal has been thrown on our country: a country, which has always pro|duced men as remarkable for honour and genius as any in the world. A few mean wretches, who are acknowledged rogues and vagabonds there, are no &s;ooner landed here, than they commence fine gentlemen and per&s;ons of honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10">
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;till I &s;ee no rea&s;on to look on the&s;e gentlemen in this odious light. Two of them e&s;pe|cially, Shark and Rook, are men of as liberal and gentlemanlike appearance as I ever was acquaint|ed with; and M'Shuffle, though not quite &s;o gen|teel and polite, has a blunt hone&s;ty about him, which makes it ridiculous as well as unju&s;t to &s;u&s;|pect him of any villainy. Be&s;ides, Rook's e&s;tate lies contiguous to mine, and he is very well ac|quainted with the whole neighbourhood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>With every acre of your e&s;tate, that I dare &s;ay; and knows how deep he may touch you, to a &s;hilling. As to that &s;mooth &s;pecious behavi|our, which takes you in, Frank, it is the common glo&s;s and varni&s;h of many a &s;coundrel, and lack|ers over mo&s;t of the &s;harpers in town. But in that rough unpoli&s;hed ra&s;cal M'Shuffle, the cheat is too gro&s;s to pa&s;s. The rank brogue in his mouth, with all that timber in his legs, and bra&s;s in his countenance, that have &s;o long di&s;tingui&s;hed the pretended Iri&s;h <HI>Jontleman</HI> from the true gentlemen of Ireland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Charles, no more of this. It is not hand&s;ome in you. I would not have them &s;u&s;pect your thoughts of them, on any ac|count: nor do I chu&s;e my&s;elf to hear any abu&s;e of my friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your friends!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall always regard them as &s;uch till I have full proof the contrary: and prithee now, my dear Knowell, do not di&s;turb the merriment of the company, but be as free, jolly, and &s;ociable, as u&s;ual. At the &s;ame time I give you my word, that when you can &s;hew any convincing rea&s;ons that they are not men of honour, I will have done with them. Will this &s;atisfy you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11">
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely: but in the mean time have a care; do not engage too ha&s;tily, and &s;uffer convic|tion to come too late for your relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear me. I &s;hall be cautious, I'll warrant you. But we lo&s;e time: we are in the land of joy now, Charles; life is &s;hort, and hours are precious. Let's in, and enquire after our friends, and &s;ee about the girls, my boy: &s;oft, &s;miling, delicate, tempting rogues, Charles! not like red-armed wa&s;herwomen and dirty bed-makers. Per|haps too we &s;hall meet with &s;ome Oxford acquain|tance, for I know that Bob Lounge, and Dick Scamper drew for their quarterage but two days ago; and they always &s;pend the fir&s;t week after they receive it in Covent-Garden.</P>
