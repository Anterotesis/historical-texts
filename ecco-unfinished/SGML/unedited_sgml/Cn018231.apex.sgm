<L>THE Comic Mu&s;e, tho' privelig'd to wear</L>
<L>A ma&s;k on her own face, &s;trips others bare,</L>
<L>And whil&s;t &s;he gives all nature to your view,</L>
<L>Shall not her mirror &s;hew th' Impo&s;tor too?</L>
<L>For tho' mo&s;t knaves in this ingenious age</L>
<L>Out-trick the law, we trap them on the &s;tage:</L>
<L>But then &s;ome poets make their knaves &s;o witty,</L>
<L>That when they pluck their vizors off, you pity.</L>
<L>Now that's a fault of poets dead and gone,</L>
<L>Our bard has kept his con&s;cience clear for one;</L>
<L>Indulge his knave in a few rogui&s;h fallies,</L>
<L>To call him witty wou'd be down right malice;</L>
<L>His bittere&s;t enemies, with all their railing,</L>
<L>Are well di&s;pos'd to'acquit him of that failing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Time was indeed, but that good time is pa&s;t,</L>
<L>When novelties did not grow old &s;o fa&s;t:</L>
<L>Woe to the piece, tho' st fir&s;t &s;ight 'twere &s;triking,</L>
<L>If &s;econd &s;ight &s;teps in and mars your liking!</L>
<L>Like a new face, it glitters for a day,</L>
<L>All run, crow'd, follow; &s;lare&mdash;and turn away.</L>
<L>Love hath it's honey-moon, but, that once o'er,</L>
<L>From &s;weet to flat, from flat it turns to &s;our;</L>
<L>Cro&s;s follows cool, as cool &s;ucceeds to civil,</L>
<L>My duck! my darling! once, and then&mdash;My devil!</L>
<L>Ev'n Wit's fine edge is dull'd by too much wearing,</L>
<L>And truths twice told will tire us in the hearing:</L>
<L>The Orator, that tries his lungs too often,</L>
<L>Will &s;et the lungs of other men a coughing;</L>
<L>No &s;ooner up, than &s;trait all parties join</L>
<L>In one unanimous re&s;olve&mdash;to dine;</L>
<L>The le&s;&s;ening &s;enate melts away by drops;</L>
<L>And metaphors are left for mutton-chops.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How then? If novelties be &s;o uncertain,</L>
<L>Sad news for our old friend behind the curtain,</L>
<L>Who&s;e Mu&s;e has pu&s;h'd her helicon about</L>
<L>So quick, we almo&s;t fear the tap is out:</L>
<L>If truth, wit, eloquence are but a Je&s;t,</L>
<L>How &s;hou'd a mere <HI>Impo&s;tor</HI> &s;tand the te&s;t?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I'll give the Bramble's an&s;wer to the Oak,</L>
<L>Small &s;ticks will blaze, when great ones only &s;moake.</L>

<P>Not yet, not yet: I am waiting here to give his lord&s;hip the good morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you mu&s;t n't wait much longer let me tell you, or it will be mid-day before his morning's be|gun: give him a good rowze in&s;tead of it and pipe all hands to breakfa&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>What kind of manners wou'd that be, friend George? We mu&s;t have no rowzing nor piping here; no &s;uch &s;ea noi&s;es with a nobleman of his high birth and breeding. Where are all my fellows? Where is Oliver?</P>

<P>And a precious Hotten$ot you have made of your&s;elf: Is that a trim to wait upon a lord in? Go, get you gone, you lazy whelp, and let me &s;ee you in your new livery; &s;lip on your other &s;kin, and then pre&s;ent my compliments to Lord Janus and beg to know how he has re&s;ted.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Czar Peter was not more plagu'd to trim the beards and whi&s;kers of his Mu&s;covites, than I to trim the&s;e clod-pated bumpkins out of their long &s;kirts and pudding-cuffs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And after all do you think 'em worth the pains? Surely my friend Oliver is at lea&s;t a match for Mon&s;ieur Philibert, the little ugly Jew-like fellow, that calls him&s;elf Lord Janus's valet de-chambre. His-lord&s;hip's &s;uite is not very &s;plendid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, George; you &s;ay true; Lord Janus does not affect pomp; he travels as it were in|cognito. His lord&s;hip at this di&s;tance from the capital may be liken'd to a comet in the extremity of its orbi$ when he approaches to the point of his attraction he will &s;end forth a &s;hining and a brilliant train: Lord Janus is a man of &s;peculation and enquiry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;hou'dn't you be a man of enquiry too-brother Solomon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where wou'd your wi&s;dom &s;end me to enquire? Of Collins's Peerage? I have his pedigree by heart; I can trace him from the heptarchy; his very title of Janus proves the circum&s;pection of his ance&s;tors; 'tis as much as to &s;ay they had all their eyes about 'em: his armorial bearings are typical of &s;agacity; two vizors in a wreath of &s;erpents: his &s;up|porters are an allegory; on the dexter &s;ide a fo$$ denoting cunning; on the &s;ini&s;ter a goo&s;e, which is the emblem of warine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h you wou'd take a le&s;&s;on from that wary goo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall take a le&s;&s;on from no goo&s;e, nor go to one for coun&s;el, &s;o pr'y thee &s;pare your pains in ad|vi&s;ing me; why will you concern your&s;elf in a bu&s;ine&s;s, that is out of your line? why will you be thru&s;ting in your oar?</P>

<P>'Twou'd not be the fir&s;t I've handled by a pretty many, if I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then keep to your element, dear George, keep to your element, the boi&s;terous ocean: you have not made human nature your &s;tudy; you have not been in the world as I have.</P>

<P>Aye, there's the ca&s;e, you have peei$$ the orange but not ta&s;ted the fruit. I am the man, the happy man, who when I fir&s;t &s;et eyes upon this noble peer, intuitively develop'd all the latent virtues of his heart; and now you &s;hall know, George, that I ex|pect his lord&s;hip to propo&s;e for Eleanor out of hand.</P>

<P>Very ea&s;ily; let him &s;ign the ab&s;tract I have prepared, which effectually binds him to the &s;ettlement, and pay you the 20,000 <HI>l.</HI> into his hands, and the af|fair is done: The marriage takes place immediately, and your daughter is the Lady Vi&s;counte&s;s Janus.</P>

<P>My Lord Janus, I am quite confounded at what has happen'd; I had no intention of inviting any per&s;on di&s;agreeable to your lord&s;hip; but what am I to do, now the gentleman is in my hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon what pretence &s;hall I turn him thus abruptly out of my hou&s;e? Has he any de&s;ign upon your lord&s;hip? Is he unfit company for a gentleman? is he other than he pretend$ to be; a cheat, an im|po&s;tor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has been pleas'd to de&s;cribe my character to you in very hand&s;ome terms: I &s;hall not &s;peak of his; I &s;hall &s;ay no more of Sir Charles Free|mantle, than that I know him only too well; and that if he is to be admitted into your hou&s;e, I mu&s;t po&s;itively quit it.</P>

<P>I can only a&s;&s;ure you, Sir Solomon, that his lord&s;hip has the be&s;t rea&s;ons in the world for what he &s;ays; a per&s;on of Lord Janus's character will be very properly delicate about entering into particulars; you mu&s;t not expect it from him: but if you &s;et any value upon his alliance, I can tell you it is no otherwi&s;e to be obtained but by di&s;ini&s;&s;ing your vi&s;itor.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, I &s;ee what you point at; you told me I was to keep no &s;ecrets from my father; I am to have no preference, no choice nor will of my own. What if I don't like Lord Janus, $Word$ I to be forc'd to marry him again&s;t my inclinations?</P>

<P>Indeed he is not, and I could be glad you would tell me for which of his lord&s;hip's &s;uperior good qualities I ought to hold him in &s;uch admiration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be a little too hard upon

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eleanor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you do him ju&s;tice a while ago, when you told us he was diffident almo&s;t to a failing? there I think I may venture to defend his character, tho' I am as little inclin'd to be his advocate as you can be. You told us at the &s;ame time he had a good heart and an excellent under&s;tanding&mdash;'tis a pity &s;uch perfection &s;hould be lo&s;t upon me. You &s;aid that he was mode&s;t, well-bred, and of the gentle&s;t manners&mdash;the&s;e are charming qualities; convince me only that his lord&s;hip po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, and I cannot chu&s;e but admire him.</P>

<P>Fie upon you, lovely but betwitching temper, you have rifled me of my heart, and now you wou'd rally me out of my rea&s;on: but I'll not be trapp'd into any &s;uch undertaking as you propo&s;e: I &s;hall leave Lord Janus to his own defence.</P>

<P>If I under&s;tood my niece rightly, Sir Charles, you have di&s;covered the &s;ituation of things in this family, and are doing that from your own dell|cacy, which wou'd el&s;e &s;eem a breach of ho&s;pitality to &s;ugge&s;t to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, Sir; I apprehend there is bu&s;ine&s;s going for ward in this family, that wou'd make my company very unrea&s;onable, and, if I am right in my conjecture, why &s;hou'd I put you to the pain of an apology?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir Charles, you have candidly excus'd me from the mo&s;t awkward &s;ervice I was ever engaged in: the truth is, my brother and Lord Janus are ju&s;t now very &s;eriou&s;ly employed; his lord&s;hip's lawyer is come from town for the purpo&s;e; and I under&s;tand the affair to be of &s;uch a nature, as not to allow of tho&s;e attentions, which, in any other circum&s;tances, they would be proud to pay you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I certainly &s;hall not think of Inter|rupting any parties &s;o engag'd; but I flatter my&s;elf that, to a gentleman of your character, I may &s;peak openly and ingenuou&s;ly what occurs to me on this occa&s;ion.</P>

<PB N="34" REF="38">
difficulties than he &s;eems to be aware of; and I am per&s;waded he is the la&s;t man living to pre&s;s forward a treaty with the lady's father, unle&s;s he thought him|&s;elf &s;ecure of her affections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be &s;o, but the&s;e are matters out of my line, which I never meddle in: I love my niece, and wi&s;h to &s;ee her happy, but I have no voice in the di&s;po&s;al of her, nor am I in the &s;ecret of her in clinati|ons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mi&s;under&s;tand me not, I pray you; I am not &s;ounding you on the &s;ubject of her inclinations, I am only guarding again&s;t tho&s;e con&s;equences, which may en&s;ue upon the pre&s;umption of Lord Janus's di&s;|appointment: I know him well, a nobler gentleman does not live, nor is there a family in the kingdom but might well be proud of his alliance.</P>

<P>This is a very honourable te&s;timony on your part, Sir Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice; and if a certain acci|dent, which happen'd this morning, may have left impre&s;&s;ions on your niece's mind in favour of an ob|ject, who&s;e preten&s;ions cannot vie with tho&s;e of Lord Janus, it becomes a very &s;erious point with me to clear my&s;elf from all &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch mean clande&s;tine mea|&s;ures, as one competitor will &s;ometimes enviou&s;ly practi&s;e to degrade and level his &s;uperior; as Lord Ja|nus is my particular friend, I mu&s;t therefore in&s;i&s;t upon an interview with him before I leave the place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I commend you for your caution, and 'tis what you have a right to expect; but as he is now in the very act of &s;igning and &s;ealing with my brother, I think you will not pre&s;s for it immediately, nor per|haps con&s;ider this hou&s;e as the propere&s;t place for your meeting.</P>

<P>The fellow &s;tipulates for an inter|view; he is waiting for me at a rendezvous in the wood; the&s;e people in&s;i&s;t upon my &s;eeing him; the captain was charg'd with a me&s;&s;age to me; Sir Solo|mon &s;till engages for his daughter, if I can drive this lurking lover out of her way.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>

of his lord&s;hip? Well then&mdash;I make up a &s;tory for the purpo&s;e; nobody is pre&s;ent at our meeting, and as he does not know I have quitted my &s;ervice, he believes what I rell him, and I bolt him.</P>

<P>Do you &s;o of a certain? &s;uppo&s;e he will not be bolted.</P>

<P>Nay, man, don't be angry: you have &s;till a good game in hand, if Dorothy's eyes tell truth; follow up your fortune there; when I am gone, the field will be open; Sir Solomon will be outrageous again&s;t his daughter and care&s;s you in hopes of making up matters with me: All this you can manage to your own purpo&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I own this carries &s;ome face: Dorothy is no &s;mall prize either in bulk or balla&s;t; &s;he's full of ingots.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now then, Jack, give me your hand, perhaps for the la&s;t time: Do we part friends?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cordially.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then fare thee well, my hearty fellow, if &s;o it &s;hall be?

<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then here's my hand! and with it my promi&s;e that if ever this fame hand takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dame Dorothy's &s;trong box, there &s;hall be a ne&s;t-egg le&s;t at the bottom for an unlucky friend to brood upon.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's hone&s;t, and I thank thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, as we are upon parting, I'll give thee a proof, that, tho' I have not known thee long, I know thee well. Thou ha&s;t every quality of a gen|tleman about thee, but the principles of one; birth, that &s;hou'd not have been di&s;grac'd; education, that

ought not to have been abus'd; and talents, which it is a &s;candal to pervest; had you applied them as you ought, in&s;tead of &s;inking into the menial drudgery of &s;ervice, you might have rais'd your&s;elf to a level with that &s;tation, which you treacherou&s;ly counterfeit.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil him&s;elf will turn morali&s;t, if you begin a preaching; therefore no more, but be|take your&s;elf to your Dorothy; if my &s;tring fails, I &s;hall away to the next inn, there con&s;ign my&s;elf to the ba&s;ket of &s;ome charitable &s;tage, where I &s;hall &s;it like the real Janus, with a melancholy face looking back|wards on the world, and meditating on the quick tran&s;itions of all human grandeur.</P>

<P>When you charge me with artifice, I am &s;ure there has been &s;ome malice employ'd again&s;t me, and I make no doubt Lord Janus is the author of it; but when you retort upon me for tho&s;e unguarded ad|vances, which prove me only too void of artifice, I can reconcile your treatment of me neither to ju&s;tice nor humanity.</P>

<P>'Tis very true, but he was pleas'd to &s;ay he wou'd take it upon nobody's word but my own; men of the world, Sir Solomon, are hard to believe that per&s;ons of high rank and nobility will &s;tep out of their own line for an alliance, when there is &s;o much beauty and attraction among&s;t their equals, but I have no &s;uch pride of nobility about me; my only am|bition is to be happy, and I per&s;uade my&s;elf your ami|able daughter is the very woman in the world to make me &s;o.</P>

<P>Doubt not, Sir Solomon, but I can make allowances for &s;uch tri&s;ting foibles as I have di&s;cover'd in Mi&s;s Eleanor; &s;o far from being piqu'd at her &s;eem|ing partiality for Sir Charles, I like her the better for it: it proves to me that her nature is &s;u&s;ceptible of love, and as I hope to render her greater &s;ervices than he has per&s;orm'd, I don't doubt of meeting greater returns of love than he has receiv'd.</P>

<P>Your lord&s;hip charms me with the gene|rous candor of your noble &s;entiments. I do not &s;ay to you that my daughter &s;hall obey me, becau&s;e I tru&s;t there will be no &s;uch repugnance on her part as may provoke me to compul&s;ion; but be this as it may, at

<P>I dare &s;ay your lord&s;hip does, and I hope you have that influence and authority over Mr. Poly|carp as may prevent it: My cou&s;in Dorothy is an old maid, and as that is a condition not of her own chu&s;|ing, I am afraid there will be little difficulty in per|&s;uading her to change it: now, my lord, her fortune, which is no trifle, &s;leeps in my hands, and if &s;he calls it out in ha&s;te, &s;he will di&s;able me from paying down the full &s;um upon the nail, which I am pledg'd for to your lord&s;hip.</P>

<P>Depend upon it, Sir Solomon, I am as annious to prevent this match as you can be, and I will take occa&s;ion to talk to Mr. Polycarp in a way, that &s;hall make him de&s;i&s;t.</P>

<P>Pray, my lord, if the que&s;tion be not an improper one, what is Mr. Polycarp's &s;ituation in life?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Polycarp's &s;ituation is dependant; I took him into my pay to relieve me from the d$udgery of writing letters to agents and auditing accounts with &s;rewards; he under&s;tands law, and is no bad &s;cholar, tho' &s;omething of the paedagogue, for to &s;ay the truth he was awhile ago an u&s;her in a country &s;chool; he is by no means of condition to a&s;pire to Mrs. Dorothy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have &s;aid enough, my lord, the country u&s;her is enough, there's an end of Mr. Polycarp, there's not another old dam&s;el in all England &s;o proud of her family as cou&s;in Dorothy: but apropoat here comes my gentleman, with your lord&s;hip's leave I will turn him over to you to prepar$ him for his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday! who are the&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very capital performers &s;ome of them; the&s;e worthy fellows play the parts of con&s;tables; the ladies were to have been married in the play to a pair of the mo&s;t infamous &s;harpers in the kingdom, but they have e&s;cap'd out of their clutches; this gentleman, who is nothing better than a lord's lacquey, plays the part of his ma&s;ter; this other gentleman, who is his brother in iniquity, has been &s;eized by the throat in the play, and by the throat will be &s;eiz'd when it is over: the manager and director of the whole move|ment, to whom alone we are indebted for the happy turn of the plot, you behold in this worthy baronet, the benefactor, friend and pre&s;erver of us all.</P>

<SPEAKER>Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, noble Captain, you will not for|get to re&s;erve a part for the hangman.</P>

<P>Mercy of mercies, have I been dup'd, gull'd, bamboozled after all?</P>

<P>Come, you are well off; hold your tongue and be thankful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Solomon, I congratulate you on your e&s;cape. You have been harbouring a knavi&s;h lacquey under a counter&s;eited title of a noble lord.&mdash;Now, Mr. Harry Singleton, &s;tand forth! What have you to &s;ay for your&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very little, Sir Charles. I have cer|tainly made free with his lord&s;hip's title; but I have endeavoured to do it all the honor in my power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do it honor, &s;irrah! how can that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>By be&s;towing it on the mo&s;t amiable young lady in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Charles</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, there is &s;ome ingenuity in your defence, but it would be an injury to mankind to let &s;uch a fellow loo&s;e upon the world; Sir Solomon, you are an acting magi&s;trate, you will make out his commitment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I an acting magi&s;trate, Sir Charles! I am an acting fool if you plea&s;e; give him his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and &s;end me to the hou&s;e of correction in his room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oliver.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I might advi&s;e, your wor&s;hip &s;hou'd turn him over to the jurymen in livery, and then he will be tried by his peers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Janus</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Sir Charles Freemantle, I be &s;eech you to take pity upon a poor young fellow, who has known better days, and been corrupted by the evil ha|bits of that fraternity, into which his hard fortune in|li&s;ted him; put me into any humble way of life, and I will be hone&s;t.</P>

<SPEAKER>Polyc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Canting ra&s;cal! I always thought you wou'd die dunghill at the la&s;t.</P>

<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday, here's a &s;turdy &s;pirit! 'tis a pity we have no pre&s;&s;gangs going: Cou&s;in Dorothy, what &s;hall we do with this fellow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Dor.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my child, all joy to you: 'Tis the fir&s;t match I have attempted to make for you, and it &s;hall be the la&s;t: hereafter let your own inclinations be your guide.</P>

<P>I believe, Eleanor, I can pretty nearly gue&s;s which way they will lead you.</P>

<P>Ah, my dear uncle, you have a talent for di&s;coveries.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Solomon, you have no impo&s;tor now to deal with; my character will meet the &s;cru|tiny. May I not a&s;pire to claim what I have been &s;o happy as to &s;ave?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Sol.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart and my ble&s;&s;ing to boot; I know of you well, Sir Charles, and &s;hall be proud of your alliance. Now let us have a general gaol delivery, and &s;ince his mock lord&s;hip has fairly brought his drama to it's cata&s;trophe, let us drop our curtain and humbly hope for the plaudit of your hands.</P>

<L>Hi&s;s in his teeth, then back goes every &s;ail,</L>
<L>Furious he drives&mdash;Ah, dreadful &s;ituation!</L>
<L>Stern foremo&s;t down the <HI>rapides</HI> of damnation.</L>
<L>Yet here and there a &s;turdy wit has try'd</L>
