<P>IT was a real De&s;ire to do good, among&s;t a very large and u&s;eful Body of People, that gave Ri&s;e to this little Piece. The Author thought the Stage, where the Bad might be di&s;grac'd, and the Good rewarded, the mo&s;t ready and effectual Me|thod for this Purpo&s;e: And, as he never wrote before in the Dramatic Way, and was unwilling to be known, he was happy in recommending the Per|formance, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Friend, to the Care and Judgment of Mr. GARRICK.</P>
