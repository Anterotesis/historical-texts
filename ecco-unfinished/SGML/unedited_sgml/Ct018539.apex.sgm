<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the long Intimacy that has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, the Obligati|ons I owe to your generous, di&s;in|tere&s;ted Friend&s;hip, and the Protec|tion and Encouragement I received both from you and your Brother, when Nece&s;&s;ity li&s;ted me in the Ser|vice of the Public; there is no Man to whom with equal Propriety and Plea&s;ure I can addre&s;s the fol|lowing Work. It would be paying a bad Compliment to the Town were I to trouble you with an Apo|logy for the Incon&s;iderablene&s;s of the Pre&s;ent. I thought it worthy their Attention, and con&s;equently not beneath the Acceptance of my Friend.

With the Aid of a Love-plot I could have &s;pun out the Piece to the Ex|tent of five Acts; but be&s;ides that I wanted to confine the Eye to the &s;ingle Object of my Satire, I declare my&s;elf a Rebel to this univer&s;al Ty|rant, who, not contented with ex|citing all that is pitiful or terrible in human Nature, has claim'd the Privilege of occa&s;ioning every Thing that is ridiculous or contemptible in it; and thus from the abject Sub|mi&s;&s;ion of our dramatic <HI>Poets</HI> is both <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI> &s;ubjected to the Power of <HI>Love.</HI> It may be thought pre&s;umptuous in me to have digni|fy'd &s;o &s;hort a Performance with the Name of a <HI>Comedy;</HI> but when my Rea&s;ons why it cannot be call'd a <HI>Farce</HI> are con&s;ider'd, the <HI>Critics</HI> mu&s;t indulge me with the U&s;e of that Title; at lea&s;t, till they can furni&s;h me with a better.

Objects of <HI>Comedy</HI> &s;o the Powers of the Imagination (Plot and Incident excepted) are in this kind of Writing greatly re&s;train'd. No unnatural A&s;|&s;emblages, no Creatures of the Fancy can procure the Protection of the <HI>Comic</HI> Mu&s;e; Men and Things mu&s;t appear as they are. To <HI>Farce</HI> greater Liberties are permitted. I look upon <HI>Farce</HI> to hold the &s;ame Rank in the Drama, that <HI>Burle&s;que</HI> does in other Poetry. It is employ'd either in deba&s;ing lofty Subjects&punc; or in rai&s;ing humble Ones&punc; Of the two Kinds we have Examples in the <HI>Tom Thumb</HI> of Mr. <HI>F</HI>&mdash;, and a Trave&s;ty of the <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> where <HI>Penelope</HI> keeps an Alehou&s;e, <HI>Telemachus</HI> is a Tap&s;ter, and the <HI>Heroe</HI> a recruiting Serjeant. In both the&s;e In&s;tances you &s;ee Nature is re|ver&s;ed; but as I flatter my&s;elf in the following Sheets her Steps have been trod with an indeviating Sim|plicity, give me Leave to hope, that

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I was always apprehen&s;ive that the Subject of the following Piece was too ab&s;tracted and &s;ingular for the Comprehen&s;ion of a mix'd A&s;&s;embly. <HI>Juno Lucina, Jupiter Tonans, Phi|dias, Praxiteles,</HI> with the other Gentlemen and Ladies of Antiquity, were, I dare &s;ay, utterly unknown to my very good Friends of the Gal|lery; nor to &s;peak the Truth do I beleive they had many Acquaintances in the other Parts of the Hou&s;e. But tho' I de&s;pair of gratifying the <HI>Populum Tributim</HI> of the THEATRE, yet I flatter my&s;elf the <HI>Primores Populi</HI> will find me no di&s;agreeable Companion in the Clo&s;et, <HI>et &s;atis magnum Theatrum mihi e&s;tis.</HI></P>
<P>I was neither prompted by a lucrative, nor an ambitious Motive to this Undertaking. My De&s;ign was to &s;erve a Man, who had ever great Merit with his Friends, and to whom, on the &s;core of &s;ome late Tran&s;actions, I think the Public va&s;tly indebted. That my good Intenti|ons for Mr. WORSDALE have proved &s;ucce&s;sful, is intirely oweing to the Genero&s;ity and Huma|nity of the Managers of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> THEATRE;
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
they have given him a Benefit and are jointly entitled to my Thanks; but as to Mr. GARRICK, I have more per&s;onal Obligati|ons. I take this Opportunity of a&s;&s;uring him, that I &s;hall ever retain the mo&s;t grateful Re|membrance of his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, A&s;&s;iduity, and kind Concern&punc; at the Birth, Progre&s;s, and un|timely End of this my la&s;t and favourite Off|&s;pring.</P>
<P>The Objects of my Satire were &s;uch as I thought, whether they were con&s;ider'd in a moral, a political, or a ridiculous Light, de&s;er|ved the Notice of the <HI>Comic</HI> Mu&s;e. I was de|termined to brand tho&s;e <HI>Goths</HI> in Science, who had pro&s;tituted the u&s;eful Study of Antiquity to trifling &s;uperficial Purpo&s;es; who had bla&s;ted the Progre&s;s of the elegant Arts among&s;t us, by unpardonable Frauds and ab&s;urd Prejudices; and who had corrupted the Minds and Morals of our Youth, by per&s;uading them that what only &s;erves to illu&s;trate Literature was true Learning, and active Idlene&s;s real Bu&s;ine&s;s. How far this End has been obtain'd is now in the following Sheets more generally &s;ubmitted to the Public.</P>
