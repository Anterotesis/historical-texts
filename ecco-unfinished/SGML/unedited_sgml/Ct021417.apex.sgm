<P>HEIGHO!&mdash;&s;ix dark and weary miles, and not yet at the camp; how tediou&s;ly affliction traces.&mdash;Come, Gregory, come on, why how you lag behind: poor &s;imple &s;oul, what cares has he to weigh him down?&mdash;Oh, yes, he has &s;erved me from my cradle, and his plain hone&s;t heart feels for his mi&s;tre&s;s's fallen fortunes, and is &s;o heavy.&mdash;Come, my good old fel|low, come.</P>

<P>Six&mdash;&s;ixteen, if we've gone an inch; my feet are cut in pieces. A man may as well do pe|nance with peas in his &s;hoes as trudge over the&s;e con|$ounded roads in Northumberland. I u&s;ed to wonder
<PB N="6" REF="5">
when we were at home in the South, where it is as &s;mooth as a bowling-green, what the labourers did with the loo&s;e &s;tones they carried off the highways.&mdash;But now I find they come and &s;hoot their rubbi&s;h in the northern countries. I wi&s;h we had never come into 'em, with all my heart.</P>

<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are weary of my &s;ervice&mdash;you wi&s;h you had not followed me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who, I&mdash;Heaven forbid! I'd follow you to the end of the world;&mdash;nay, for the matter of that, I believe I <HI>&s;hall</HI> follow there: for I have tramp'd after you a damn'd long way without knowing where we are going. But I'd live&mdash;aye and <HI>die</HI> to &s;erve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, we mu&s;t to the wars, my good Gregory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>The wars! O Lord, that' s taking me at my word with a vengeance&mdash;I never could abide fighting, there's &s;omething &s;o plaguey quarrel&s;ome in it.</P>

<P>Don't you ob&s;erve the lights breaking thro' the tents yonder?</P>

<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on me&mdash;they are tents &s;ure enough. Come, Madam, let's wheel about, if you plea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, whither &s;hould I go, poor &s;impleton? my hou&s;e is wretchedne&s;s&mdash;The wars I &s;eek have made it &s;o&mdash;they have robb'd me of my hu&s;band&mdash;comfort now is lo&s;t to me, My very children, who&s;e pretty frolic round our hearth, charm'd even time and made the lagging winter's night fly &s;wift as lover's meet|ings&mdash;even they make my heart bleed if they but &s;mile on me&mdash;I ki&s;s them thro' my tears, and &s;igh that they have lo&s;t a father. Oh Gondibert, too faithful to weak cau&s;e&mdash;our ruin is involved with our betters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, rot the cau&s;e! &s;ay I&mdash;plague on the hou&s;e of Lance&s;ter, it has been many a noble gentle|man's undoing: the white and red ro&s;es have cau&s;ed more eyes to water in England than if we had planted the whole i&s;land with onions. Such a coil kept up with the&s;e two hou&s;es&mdash;one's &s;o old, and t'other's &s;o old, they ought both to be pull'd down, for a couple of nui&s;ances to the nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace! peace! man&mdash;half &s;uch a word tho' &s;poken at random might co&s;t your life&mdash;the times, Gregory, are dangerous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true indeed, Madam; Death has no mode&s;ty in him now-a-days; he &s;tares every body full in the face. I wi&s;h we had kept quiet at home out of his way: who knows but my ma&s;ter, Lord Gondi|bert, might have return'd too as unexpectedly as he went&mdash;I'm &s;ure he left us unexpectedly enough, for the deuce of any notice did he give us of his going.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Gregory, was it not unkind&mdash;and yet I will not call him &s;o&mdash;the times are cruel&mdash;not my hu&s;band&mdash;his affection had too much thought in it to change&mdash;his regular love corrected by the &s;teady vigour of his mind knew not the turbulence of boyi&s;h raptures; but like a &s;ober river in its banks flowed with a &s;weet and equal current. Oh it was &s;uch a placid &s;tream of tenderne&s;s!&mdash;How long is it &s;ince your ma&s;ter left us, Gregory?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Six months come to morrow, Madam&mdash;I caught a violent cold the &s;ame day; it has &s;ettled in my eyes I believe, for they have been trouble&s;ome to me ever &s;ince.&mdash;Ah! I &s;hall never forget that mor|ning when the &s;pies of the hou&s;e of York, that's got upon the throne, &s;urrounded him for being an old friend to the Lanca&s;ters. Egad he laid about him like a lion, and with his broad-&s;word, whack, he comes me one over the &s;conce. Pat he goes me another over the cheek&mdash;and after putting 'em all out of breath,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
about he wheels his hor&s;e, and we have never &s;een or heard of him &s;ince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And from that day to this I have in vain cheri&s;h'd hopes of his return&mdash;fearful, no doubt, of being &s;urpri&s;ed, he keeps conceal'd; thus is he torn from me&mdash;torn from his children&mdash;from tender blo&s;|&s;oms too weak to be expos'd to the rude tempe&s;ts of the times, and leaves their innocence un&s;heltered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and mine among the re&s;t&mdash;But what is it you mean to do, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>To &s;eek him in the camp&mdash;the Lanca&s;ters again are making head here in the north. If he has had an oppotunity of joining them, 'tis more than probable he is in their army&mdash;neither will we, and for this purpo&s;e have I doff'd my woman's habit&mdash;leaving my hou&s;e to the care of a tru&s;ty friend&mdash;and thus ac|coutred have led you, Gregory, the faithful follower of my &s;orrows, a weary journey half over England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Weary, oh dear&mdash;no, not, at all&mdash;I cou'd turn about again directly, and walk back bri&s;ker by half than I came.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, man! afraid? Come, come, we run but little ri&s;que&mdash;example too will animate us&mdash;the very air of the camp, Gregory, will brace your cou|rage to the true martial pitch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be, Madam; and yet for a brac|ing air, people are apt to die in it &s;ooner than in any other place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>P&s;haw, prithee, man, put but a confident look on the matter, and we &s;hall do I warrant&mdash;a bluff and blu&s;tering out&s;ide often conceals a chicken heart&mdash;mine achs I'm &s;ure, but I'll hide my grief under the veil of airy carele&s;&s;ne&s;s&mdash;Down, &s;orrows, I'll be all bu&s;tle like the occa&s;ion.&mdash;Come, Gregory, now I mu&s;t be the petulant <HI>military</HI> &s;tripling&mdash;Mark your mi&s;tre&s;s, man, and learn&mdash;&s;ee how &s;he'll play the part of a young &s;oldier.</P>

<P>A &s;ad head-breaking, I fancy, plaguy trou|ble&s;ome times brother, buffeted by the oppo&s;ite party out of one place, and now waiting till they come to buffet us out of another. Whenever they do come, let me tell you, a man will &s;carce have time to get up from his &s;traw bed before he's laid down again by a long &s;hot of the enemy, we &s;hall be popp'd at like a parcel of partridges ri&s;ing from &s;tubble.</P>

Fear, brother, is for all the world like your bite of a tarantula, there's no conquering its effects without mu&s;ic. We are of as much con&s;e|quence to an army, as wind to a wind-mill. The wings can't be &s;et in motion without us.</P>
