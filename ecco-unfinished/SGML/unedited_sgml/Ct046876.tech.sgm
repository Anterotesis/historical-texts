<P>_THE De&s;ign of this Pam|phlet
is to &s;hew; Fir&s;t,
That King <HI>Tibbald</HI> is
ju&s;tly depos'd from being
King of Dunces, and Prince <HI>Alexan|der</HI>
advanced to the Throne by Right
Hereditary and Right of Merit.</P>
<P>That King <HI>Tibbald</HI> is incapacitated
to hold an Empire of that unbounded
Extent, by &s;ome unfortunate Qualities,
as Learning, Judgment, Sagacity, and
that Mode&s;ty which always attends
Merit.</P>
<P>That Prince <HI>Alexander</HI> is highly
Qualify'd for that &s;upream Office, by
<PB REF="5">
an Impudence which always accompanies
Stupidity, and an Ignorance as gro&s;s
as the old <HI>Egyptian</HI> Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>That his Ignorance is &s;hewn par|ticularly
by attacking &s;everal Per&s;ons
of a Hundred times greater Merit
than him&s;elf; and who had given him
no Provocation, but by &s;urpa&s;&s;ing him.
And if Per&s;ons mu&s;t be Dunces who
va&s;tly &s;urpa&s;s him, what mu&s;t he be
who is &s;o va&s;tly &s;urpa&s;s'd? Surely of
the Number of the Fools of Nature.</P>
<P>That his Ignorance in other Mat|ters
mu&s;t be very wonderful, &s;ince it
appears, that he is utterly ignorant of
an Art, which he has profe&s;s'd all his
Life-time, and that is of Poetry, and
particularly Epick Poetry.</P>
<P>That this gro&s;s Ignorance will ap|pear
by his Practice in the Bea&s;tly
<HI>Dunciad,</HI></P>
<P>And by his Speculations in the Pre|face
to his Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Iliad,</HI></P>
<P>And by his never having writ any
thing that had either any moral Mean|ing,
<PB REF="6">
or any ju&s;t De&s;ign; which has
been often &s;hewn.</P>
<P>That as he is ignorant of the Art
of Poetry, and particularly of Epick
Poetry, he is profoundly ignorant of
<HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Boileau;</HI> to
which latter he very impudently com|pares
him&s;elf, and more impudently
prefers him&s;elf.</P>
<P>That there are Ten important Dif|ferences,
which di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Boileau</HI> from
him.</P>
<P>Secondly, That as Prince <HI>Alexander</HI>
is qualify'd to be Sovereign Prince of
Dunces, he is highly qualify'd to be
King of Kn&mdash;; there being no other
Difference between the greate&s;t of Fools
and the greate&s;t of Kn&mdash;, than there
is between High Probability and Mat|ter
of Fact; Rea&s;on and good Sen&s;e
being, next to Religion, the greate&s;t
Re&s;traints upon Mankind, and the
pure&s;t Sources of Probity, Integrity,
and Sincerity.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
That he is qualify'd for this impor|tant
Office, is &s;hewn,</P>
<P>By his unparallel'd Impudence. For
as Mode&s;ty, which is it&s;elf a moral
Virtue, always accompanies the other
Virtues; great Impudence always attends
great Kn&mdash;ry; as villainous
Calumnies, audacious Lyes, accu&s;ing in|nocent
Per&s;ons of the Accu&s;er's Crimes,
on purpo&s;e to make Men of Sen&s;e look
little to Fools, and &s;hallow Knaves.</P>
<P>Divers of the&s;e Calumnies, and the&s;e
infamous Fal&s;hoods, are di&s;cover'd and
expos'd in this Pamphlet, by &s;everal
Original Letters, either atte&s;ting undeniable
Facts, or confounding impudent
Calumnies.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS
Upon Mr. POPE's
DUNCIAD.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>To Mr. LEWIS THEOBALD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I HAVE lately read over the Two
Letters which were writ by you,
and publi&s;hed in the <HI>Daily Jour|nals,</HI>
and return you my hearty
Thanks for the Plea&s;ure which I
receiv'd from them. I ob&s;erved in tho&s;e Letters
an extraordinary Piece of Gratitude in you, in
re&s;igning that Throne to <HI>P.</HI> to which he him|&s;elf
had advanced you, with Ten times more
Goodne&s;s on his Side than De&s;ert on yours.
<PB N="2" REF="9">
And it was no &s;mall Satisfaction to me, to
find that you were govern'd &s;o entirely by
Ju&s;tice, as to part with an Empire of &s;o un|bounded
an Extent, to one who had Right
Divine to it, who had by Nature an He|reditary
Indefea&s;ible Right to &s;ucceed <HI>Tom
D'Urfey</HI> and <HI>Settle.</HI> One certain Sign of his
being even born to be no le&s;s than ab&s;olute
Monarch of all the Dunces over the whole
Face of the Earth, was his conferring that
Title on you, who have unfortunate Qualities
that are &s;o incompatible with it, as Mode&s;ty,
Humanity, Di&s;cernment, Penetration, Sagacity,
together with an uncommon Knowledge of
Letters, and Skill in the learned Languages:
The&s;e are Talents which utterly unqualify you
to govern a Generation of Mortals, who are
not influenced by any of them, and who
have not the lea&s;t Notion of &s;ome of them.
Whereas <HI>P.</HI> has one Qualification alone, which
gives him an indi&s;putable Right to wear the
Imperial Crown of the Dunces; and that is,
that &s;oaring matchle&s;s Impudence, begot by
Pride on Stupidity, which &s;trikes &s;o &s;trongly
on the outward Sen&s;es, by which Dunces are
entirely govern'd. Whereas Genius, and Wit,
and Learning, and Truth, and Sen&s;e, and De|corum,
&s;peak forcibly only to the under&s;tand|ing
Few, and have Power over them alone.
That high and undaunted A&s;&s;urance qualified
him to &s;et up for an Editor, in &s;pite of Learn|ing,
or Art, or Nature, as you have &s;o clearly
<PB N="3" REF="10">
&s;hewn; and that qualified him to &s;et up for
a Ver&s;ifier, without Numbers; and for a Cri|tick,
without Ta&s;te or Judgment; as I for|merly
&s;hew'd &s;o clearly: That &s;oaring and
matchle&s;s Impudence al&s;o gave him plenary
Power, to throw out his Titles to the Right
and the Left, without any Di&s;cernment or
Di&s;tinction. So that Per&s;ons whom God and
Nature have plac'd immen&s;e Degrees above
him, are dubb'd, by him, Fools, Blockheads,
Dunces, and Scoundrels, according to his So|vereign
Plea&s;ure; which puts me in mind of
a little Gentleman, who was in the Court of
one of our Kings, a Wit, ju&s;t &s;uch a Wit
as Mr. <HI>P.</HI> is in the Reign of King <HI>G.</HI> II.
This motley Gentleman was wont to &s;alute
every one whom he met in the Morning,
with <HI>Good-morrow, Brother Fool,</HI> whether it
was Bi&s;hop or Archbi&s;hop, or Pre&s;ident of the
Council, or Secretary of State, which often
caus'd his lower Parts rudely to &s;uffer for
the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Parts above them.
And I wi&s;h Mr. <HI>P.</HI> had been &s;o happy as to
take Warning by that Example:
<Q>Faelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</Q></P>
<P>It was long before I had the Happine&s;s to
be acquainted with you, who were then very
young, that I publi&s;h'd Remarks upon the
Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Iliad</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> by <HI>P.</HI>
upon his <HI>Wind&s;or Fore&s;t,</HI> writ in Envy of Sir
<PB N="4" REF="11">
<HI>John Denham</HI>'s Poem upon <HI>Cooper</HI>'s <HI>Hill;</HI>
upon the infamous <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> writ in
Envy of <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s Poem upon the &s;ame Sub|ject;
and upon the Ode on <HI>Caecilia</HI>'s Day,
writ in Envy of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Fea&s;t of <HI>Alex|ander;</HI>
an Ode in which <HI>P.</HI> very wi&s;ely pre|tends
to &s;hew the Power of Mu&s;ick, by the
Story of <HI>Orph$us;</HI> that is, by an Allegory.
For <HI>Horace,</HI> who may be allow'd to be a pretty
good Judge of this Ma$ter, tells us, that the
whole Story of <HI>Orpheus</HI> is nothing but an
Allegory:
<Q><L>Sylve&s;tres homines &s;acer interpre&s;que Deorum</L>
<L>Caedibus, &amp; v$ctu foedo det$rru$t Orpheus;</L>
<L>Dictus ob hoc lenire tigres rapido&s;que leones.</L></Q></P>
<P>And my Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon,</HI> in his Trea|ti&s;e
of the Wi&s;dom of the Antients, is of the
&s;ame Opinion.</P>
<P>As I have lately peru&s;ed all the 'fore&s;aid
Remarks, and &s;ome of them after a very long
Di&s;tance of Time from the fir&s;t writing and
publi&s;hing them; &s;o that the warm and partial
Conceit of an Author had been a long time
extingui&s;h'd: As I have not only done this,
but con&s;ulted likewi&s;e my &s;incere&s;t and mo&s;t
judicious Friends, both they and I have found,
that the Remarks which I &s;ubmitted to their
Cen&s;ure&punc; were rea&s;onable, ju&s;t, and &s;olid, and
con&s;equently that the Pieces on which they
were writ, were infinitely below the Ma&s;ter|pieces,
<PB N="5" REF="12">
in Envy of which they were publi&s;hed
by their &s;candalous Author.</P>
<P>Now, as <HI>P.</HI> apparently wrote the 'for$&s;aid
Pieces, in Envy to the Reputation of their
celebrated Authors, neither you nor I can have
any R$a&s;on to doubt, but that if tho&s;e Au|thors
had been his Contemporaries, if Time
and Death, and impartial Po&s;terity had not
given a Sanction to their Writings, he would
have put all of them into the Number of his
Dunces. For either he mu&s;t have re&s;olved to
be a Foil to them, which his mon&s;trous and
impudent Vanity will not let us &s;uppo&s;e, or
he mu&s;t have believed that he could &s;urpa&s;s
them, and con&s;equently we mu&s;t conclude,
that in&s;tead of You, he would have placed
<HI>Dryden,</HI> or <HI>Denham,</HI> or <HI>Waller,</HI> if they had
been now alive, upon the Imperial Throne of
his Dunces.</P>
<P>As in making the&s;e Remarks, I have en|deavour'd
to &s;hew him an Author without
Judgment, or without any thing of that good
Sen&s;e, which, if we will believe <HI>Horace,</HI> is
the only Source of good Writing in Poetry:
<Q>Scribendi recte &s;apere e&s;t &amp; pincipium &amp;
fons;</Q>
Nay, without any Degree of rea&s;onable Mean|ing:
I &s;hall, in &s;ending you Remarks upon
&s;ome of the pro&s;aick Parts of the Edition of
his late Rhap&s;ody in <HI>Quarto,</HI> [for the Rhimes
<PB N="6" REF="13">
by their own Vilene&s;s are &s;ecur'd from Criti|ci&s;m,]
endeavour to lay before you, not only
his utter Ignorance of the poetical Art, but
his Malice, his Impudence, his Fal&s;hood, and
his want of Honour.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, to come to the Prelimina|ries
before his Rhap&s;ody, both that before the
Volume in Twelves, and that before the other
in <HI>Quarto:</HI> Oh, the Truth, the Wi&s;dom, the
Mode&s;ty, the Humility that there is to be found
in both! As he formerly writ Rhimes in his
own Commendation, and publi&s;h'd Mr. <HI>Wy|cherley</HI>'s
Name to them, he has now been
dabbling after the &s;ame Manner in Pro&s;e. He
has before each of the&s;e Volumes writ his own
ful&s;ome Panegyricks: And each of the&s;e &s;ul|&s;ome
Panegyricks is pretended to be writ by
others, for&s;ooth, without the lea&s;t Knowledge
or Privacy of this mode&s;t Author. Now, Sir,
either he imagines, that he can make the im|partial
World believe this, or he does not.
If he does not imagine that he can impo&s;e this
upon the &s;en&s;ible and impartial World, to
what End or Purpo&s;e is this noble Fiction?
Was it to convince his &s;en&s;ible Readers, that
he can out-equivocate, and out-prevaricate the
pontifical Scaramouchi, from whom he had
his Education and In&s;truction? or was it con|triv'd
to make &s;ome Addition to the Hundred
thou&s;and Fools, who, he &s;ays, already admire
him? But if he does imagine that he can im|po&s;e
this Fal&s;hood upon the &s;en&s;ible and impar|tial
<PB N="7" REF="14">
World, can there be a more certain Sign
that he has made you an U&s;urper, and plac'd
you upon a Throne to which he him&s;elf has
an indefea&s;ible Right? Was there ever &s;uch an
empty, &s;uch an impudent Scribler? Did ever
any fanatical <HI>Aegyptian</HI> of old offer more
Incen&s;e to one of Pug's Ance&s;tors, than Pug
has offer'd to him&s;elf, who is at once the Vo|tary
and the Prie&s;t, and a little mimicking,
mi&s;chievous, ludicrous God upon the Altar?</P>
<P>That he was the Author of both the&s;e Pre|liminaries,
is not only a Truth that is in it&s;elf
apparent, and that carries its own Evidence
with it; but 'tis known to half the Town,
that he carried or &s;ent both the&s;e Panegyricks
to the Pre&s;s him&s;elf. That the lat$er was
printed by one <HI>Wr&mdash;t,</HI> who was formerly
Operator to Alderman <HI>B&mdash;,</HI> and who
lives in a Place call'd <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Hill,</HI> between
<HI>Doctors-Commons</HI> and the <HI>Thames,</HI> a Place
in which this Poeta&s;ter exceedingly delights,
becau&s;e he has in the Neighbourhood of it,
like his Brother Proctor <HI>John Littlewit,
Addle Hill</HI> for his <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and <HI>Puddle-Dock</HI>
for his <HI>Hippocrene;</HI> by drinking large
Draughts of which latter, he was in&s;pir'd with
that cleanly, that noble, that gallant Inven|tion
of <HI>Fleet-Ditch;</HI> an Invention &s;o fit to
entertain and charm the mo&s;t delicate Per&s;ons
of both Sexes. Does not half the Town
know, that hone&s;t <HI>J. W.</HI> was the only
Dunce that was per&s;ecuted and plagu'd by this
<PB N="8" REF="15">
Impre&s;&s;ion? that Twenty times the Rhap&s;odi&s;t
alter'd every thing that he gave the Printer?
and that Twenty times, <HI>W.</HI> in Rage and in
Fury, threaten'd to turn the <HI>Rhap&s;ody</HI> back
upon the Rhap&s;odi&s;t's Hands?</P>
<P>Give me Leave, Sir, to &s;ay &s;omething apart
to each of the&s;e two Preliminaries, both to
that in Twelves, and to that in <HI>Quarto.</HI> I
&s;hall begin with the former, which is &s;uper|&s;crib'd,
<HI>The Publi&s;her to the Reader.</HI> The
fir&s;t extraordinary Paragraph in it, has two ge|neral
A&s;&s;ertions, which, generally taken, are
fal&s;e, and which the Author, to &s;hew his Lo|gical
Head, is for proving true by a particular
In&s;tance, and, to &s;hew his great Mode&s;ty, takes
that In&s;tance from him&s;elf. The fir&s;t general
A&s;&s;ertion is, <HI>That, when any Scandal is vented
again&s;t a Man of the highe&s;t Di&s;tinction and
Charact$r, either in the State or in Litera|ture,
the Publick in general afford it a quiet
Reception, and the larger Part accept it as
favourably, as if it were &s;ome Kindne&s;s done
to them&s;elves.</HI> This is the fir&s;t general A&s;&s;er|tion.
Now, Sir, for the particular In&s;tance
intended to prove the Truth of it; <HI>I will
only ob&s;erve one Fact,</HI> &s;ays <HI>P. that every Week
for th$&s;e Two Months pa&s;t, the Town has
been p$r&s;ecuted with Pamphlets, Adverti&s;e|m$nts,
L$tters, and weekly E&s;&s;ays, not only
again&s;t my Wit and Writings, who am a Man
of the highe&s;t Di&s;tinction and Character in
Literature, but again&s;t my Per&s;on and Cha|racter.
<PB N="9" REF="16">
And that of all tho&s;e Men who have
received Plea&s;ure from my Writings, which
by a mode&s;t Computation</HI> [Oh! the charming
Beauties of that attractive Virtue, Mode&s;ty!]
<HI>may be about a Hundred thou&s;and in the&s;e
Kingdoms of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>not to men|tion</HI>
Jer&s;ey <HI>and</HI> Guern&s;ey, [<HI>which you know,
&s;ays</HI> P. <HI>are not in</HI> England, <HI>becau&s;e they are
in</HI> Hamp&s;hire,] <HI>or the</HI> Orcades, [<HI>which I men|tion
without naming</HI> Scotland, <HI>&s;weetly to in|&s;inuate,
that there is no &s;uch thing as Ta&s;te
of Literature in any Part of</HI> North-Britain,
<HI>unle&s;s in that which is next to</HI> Greenland,]
<HI>or the new World, or Foreigners who have
tran&s;lated me into their Languages, not a
Man among them has &s;tood up to &s;ay one Word
in my Defence.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I laid before you the fir&s;t
general A&s;&s;ertion, and the particular In&s;tance
intended to prove the Truth of it. But now,
Sir, as I ob&s;erv'd before, <HI>P</HI>'s undi&s;tingui&s;hing
Noddle has not found out, that his fir&s;t gene|ral
A&s;&s;ertion, generally taken, is fal&s;e; for if
by a Man of the highe&s;t Di&s;tinction and Cha|racter,
he means one who has highly de&s;erv'd
either of his Country or of the Common|wealth
of Learning, [But then he mu&s;t not in
anywi&s;e mean him&s;elf, who has de&s;erved no|thing
of the latter, and very ill of the former] I
may ju&s;tly affirm, that any Scandal or Calum|ny
publi&s;hed again&s;t &s;uch a one, mu&s;t be ut|terly
&s;hocking to any Man of good Sen&s;e, or
<PB N="10" REF="17">
Candour, or Integrity, or Humanity, though
perhaps it may be plea&s;ing enough to <HI>P</HI>'s Hun|dred
thou&s;and Admirers: For People of their
Capacities are always Levellers, and when they
find it impo&s;&s;ible for them to rai&s;e them&s;elves
to an Equality with Merit, they politickly lay
hold of any Opportunity to bring Merit down
to their Level.</P>
<P>Thus have I &s;hewn that this fir&s;t general A&s;|&s;ertion
is not prov'd by the particular In&s;tance,
not only becau&s;e no general Conclu&s;ion can be
drawn from Particulars, but becau&s;e the Per&s;on
mention'd in the general A&s;&s;ertion is immen&s;ely
di&s;tant from the Creature mention'd in the
particular In&s;tance; as di&s;tinct as Ea&s;t from
We&s;t, or as Earth from Heaven. For if <HI>P.</HI>
has the Misfortune to fancy him&s;elf <HI>a Per&s;on
of the highe&s;t Di&s;tinction and Character in
Literature,</HI> as he plainly infers that he does,
his Pericranium is certainly as much out of
Order, and he as much wants to be trepann'd,
as if he had declar'd him&s;elf <HI>Grand Signior,</HI>
Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> or the <HI>Great Mogul.</HI></P>
<P>But now to come to the &s;econd general A&s;|&s;ertion,
which is a ble&s;&s;ed one, and is as fol|lows:
<HI>If a known Scoundrel or Blockhead
chance to be but touch'd upon, a whole Legion
is up in Arms, and it becomes the common
Cau&s;e of all Scriblers, Printers, and Book|&s;ellers
what&s;oever.</HI> Now the particular In|&s;tance
or Fact gives the Lye to this general
A&s;&s;ertion. For a certain known Scoundrel,
<PB N="11" REF="18">
and horrible Blockhead, has lately not only
been touch'd upon, but dwelt upon, and has
been pelted as much and as plentifully as if
his Ears had been nail'd to the Pillory, and
yet not one of all his Hundred thou&s;and Ad|mirers,
whether in <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> or <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> or the
<HI>Orcades,</HI> or in the new World, not any Man
has &s;tood up to &s;ay one Word in his Defence.</P>
<P>I hope this will convince his Patrons and
his Admirers, who have purchas'd Scurrility
and Non&s;en&s;e at &s;o dear a Rate, that nothing
is more ea&s;y than to give foul Language, but
that 'tis Ten times more excu&s;able in Me than
it is in Him; fir&s;t, becau&s;e <HI>lae&s;it prior,</HI> I only
retort the Language he gave; &s;econdly, becau&s;e
in the Remarks which I formerly made upon
the &s;everal Things he has publi&s;h'd, I have
given &s;uch Rea&s;ons, why this Language is his
Due, as have convinc'd every &s;en&s;ible impar|tial
Reader, that there is not in any of tho&s;e
Trifles the lea&s;t Degree of that Solidity, that
Morality, and that good Sen&s;e, which are
the Principles and Fountain of all good Wri|ting
in Poetry: I &s;hall pur&s;ue the &s;ame Method
in the Animadver&s;ions, which from time to
time I &s;hall &s;end you upon the brutal <HI>Dunciad;</HI>
and before I have done with this fir&s;t Prelimi|nary,
I &s;hall take one Occa&s;ion from it, to
convince the Reader, that this bouncing Bully
of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> is nothing but a fal&s;e Brave,
a mere bragging pretending Empirick, and
utterly ignorant of the fir&s;t Rudiments of an
<PB N="12" REF="19">
Art which he has more than Twenty Years
profe&s;&s;ed, and in which he has nothing but
Impudence and Ignorance, and Fal&s;hood to
&s;upport him.</P>
<P><HI>In order to &s;hew this, let us &s;ee the Account
that</HI> P. <HI>him&s;elf gives of his</HI> Dunciad. It is
&s;til'd, <HI>&s;ays be,</HI> Heroick, as being doubly &s;o, not only
with re&s;pect to its Nature, which according
to the be&s;t Rules of the Antients, and &s;tricte&s;t
Ideas of the Moderns, is critically &s;uch; but
al&s;o with regard to the heroical Di&s;po&s;ition,
and high Courage of the Writer, who dar'd to
&s;tir up &s;uch a formidable, irritable, and im|placable
Race of Mortals.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>P.</HI> all at once makes him&s;elf the
Hero of his wonderful Rhap&s;ody, and &s;tiles
his Folly, his Impudence, his In&s;olence, and
his want of Capacity to di&s;cern and to di&s;tin|gui&s;h,
high Courage; for want of which Ca|pacity,
he mu&s;t be told, that a Bully is of all
Mortals, the mo&s;t Fooli&s;h, the mo&s;t Impudent,
and the mo&s;t In&s;olent, but at the &s;ame time
Cowardly. And here, Sir, give me leave to
ob&s;erve what the &s;candalous Chronicle reports,
That as &s;oon as the Rhap&s;ody was publi&s;h'd,
<HI>P.</HI> never dar'd to appear without a tall <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI>
attending him, who is &s;o in&s;eparable from
him, that one would &s;wear that he owes his
Wit as well as his Courage to him.</P>
<P>But there is now a Nece&s;&s;ity for going back
a little, <HI>The</HI> Dunciad, <HI>&s;ays</HI> P, <HI>is &s;tiled Heroick
with re&s;pect to its Nature, which, according to the
<PB N="13" REF="20">
be&s;t Rules of the Antients, and &s;tricte&s;t Ideas
of the Moderns, is critically &s;uch.</HI> Here then
let us &s;ee what the Propo&s;ition of every Epick
Poem, whether Serious and Real, or Mock
and Ridiculous, ought to be; and then whether
<HI>P</HI>'s Propo&s;ition is agreeable to it.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;ition of an Epick Poem, <HI>&s;ays Bo&s;&s;u,</HI>
is, That fir&s;t Part of the Poem, in which the
Author propo&s;es briefly, and in general, what
he de&s;igns to &s;ay in the Body of his Work; in
which there are two Things to be con&s;idered,
the one is what the Poet propo&s;es, and the
other is the Manner of his propo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;ition, <HI>continues he,</HI> ought to
contain the Matter of the Poem only; that is
to &s;ay, the Action of it, and the Per&s;ons who
execute that Action, whether tho&s;e Per&s;ons
are Divine or Human: We find all that in
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;es,</HI> and in the <HI>Aeneid.</HI></P>
<P>The Action that <HI>Homer</HI> propo&s;es to &s;ing in
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> is the Revenge that <HI>Achilles</HI> takes
for the Affront that is offered him; that of
the <HI>Ody&s;&s;es</HI> is the Return of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to <HI>Ithaca;</HI>
and that of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> is the Empire of
<HI>Troy</HI> transferr'd by <HI>Aeneas</HI> to <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>We ought not to &s;uff$r our&s;elves to be &s;ur|prized
by the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Homer</HI> in the Begin|ning
of his <HI>Iliad,</HI> where he &s;ays that he &s;ings
the pernicious Wrath of <HI>Achilles,</HI> nor believe
that he propo&s;es that Wrath as the Subject of
his Poem: At that rate he could not relate an
Action to his Reader, but a Pa&s;&s;ion; We ought
<PB N="14" REF="21">
not to &s;top there, &s;ince he him&s;elf has not &s;topp'd
there. He tells us, that he &s;ings the Wrath
which caus'd the <HI>Greeks</HI> to &s;uffer &s;uch mighty
Lo&s;&s;es, and was the Death of &s;o many Heroes.
He propo&s;es then an Action, and not a &s;imple
Pa&s;&s;ion for the Matter of his Poem; and that
Action is, as we &s;aid before, the Revenge that
<HI>Achilles</HI> takes for the Affront that is offered
him.</P>
<P>Thus in the other two Poems, they propo&s;e
at fir&s;t a Man; but the Propo&s;itions &s;top not
there, they add, that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;uffered very much
in his Endeavour to return into his Country,
or that the De&s;ign of <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Voyage was to
e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in <HI>Italy.</HI> Both the one and
the other, then, of the two Poets propo&s;es to
&s;ing an Action.</P>
<P>But &s;o much for &s;erious and real Epick or
Heroick Poems. Let us now come to the
Mock and the Comick ones, and we &s;hall find,
that this Poem, by changing its Nature, does
not change its Manner. <HI>Boileau,</HI> who was
one of the greate&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Poets, and
one of the mo&s;t judicious of their Criticks,
calls his <HI>Lutrin, Poeme Heroique,</HI> an Heroical
or Epick Poem; and yet in the Propo&s;ition
to this Poem, which was de&s;igned purely for
Plea&s;antry, he propo&s;es to &s;ing an Action, as
appears by the Propo&s;ition it&s;elf.</P>
<Q><L>Je Chante les combats, et ce Prelat terrible,</L>
<L>Qui par &s;es long Travaux et &s;a Force invincible,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="22">
Dans une illu&s;tre Egli&s;e exercant &s;on grand coeur</L>
<L>Fit placer a la fin un Lutrin dans le Choeur.</L>
<L>Ce&s;t en vain que le Chantre appui&eacute; d'un vain Titre,</L>
<L>Deux fois l'enfit oter par les mains du Chapitre;</L>
<L>Ce Prelat &s;ur le Banc de &s;on Rival altier</L>
<L>Deux fois le rapportant l'en couvrit tout entier.</L></Q>
<P>Which in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pro&s;e is thus,</P>
<P>I &s;ing the Combats, and that terrible Pre|late,
who, by his long Labours, and his invin|cible
Courage, cau&s;ing his great Soul to be &s;een
by his Actions, in an illu&s;trious Church, cau&s;ed
at length a &s;tately Pulpit to be erected in the
Choir. In vain did the Chanter, &s;upported by
an empty Title, twice cau&s;e it to be taken down
by the Hands of the Chapter; and twice did
the Prelate, cau&s;ing it to be carried back again,
fix it before the Seat of his proud Rival, and
covering him, and hiding him from the Con|gregation,
mortify him &s;everely.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Boileau,</HI> in the Propo&s;ition to a mock
Epick, or Heroick Poem, propo&s;es to &s;ing an
Action; and accordingly entertains the Reader
with it.</P>
<P>And though <HI>Butler</HI> in his Propo&s;ition to
<HI>Hudibras,</HI> does not pretend to &s;ing one regu|lar
Action [for very little of the Rules of
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> was known then in <HI>England</HI>] yet
&s;till he propo&s;es to &s;ing Action, or Actions, as
will appear by the Propo&s;ition it&s;elf.</P>
<Q><PB N="16" REF="23">
<L>When Civil Fury fir&s;t grew high,</L>

<P>So that the excellent Author of <HI>Hudibras,</HI>
who had &s;o admirable a Talent for Plea&s;antry,
propo&s;es chiefly to entertain his Reader with
the Actions of his Hero.</P>
<P><HI>Now let us take a &s;hort View of</HI> P&mdash;<HI>'s
Propo&s;ition to his</HI> Dunciad; <HI>and after that
you will ea&s;ily judge</HI> how far 'tis Heroick with
re&s;pect to its Nature, and how far it is criti|cally
&s;uch, according to the be&s;t Rules of the
Antients, and &s;tricte&s;t Ideas of the Moderns.</P>
<Q><L>Books, and the Man, I &s;ing, the fir&s;t who brings</L>
<L>The <HI>Smithfield</HI> Mu&s;es to the Ears of Kings.</L></Q>
<P>Let us dive&s;t it of its Jingle, &s;ince Rhyme is
of no u&s;e to the Non&s;en&s;e of &s;uch Pro&s;e as
<PB N="17" REF="24">
this, but to render it more ridiculous, and
more unintelligible.</P>
<P>I &s;ing Books, and I &s;ing the Man, the fir&s;t
Man, who carries the Mu&s;es of <HI>Smithfield</HI> to
the Ear of Kings.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>P.</HI> &s;ings Books, and not an Action;
and the Author who pretends in an Epick
Poem to &s;ing Books in&s;tead of &s;inging an Action,
is only qualified to &s;ing Ballads. And as Na|ture
has begun to qualify him for that melo|dious
Vocation, by giving him that Face, that
Shape, and that Stature; &s;o if Fortune would
but fini&s;h what Nature has begun, he would
be a Nonpareillo in that Employment. As he
has for &s;everal Months la&s;t pa&s;t, been bringing
down a wooden Tempe&s;t upon his Carca&s;s, if
one Eye and one Leg &s;hould &s;uffer &s;everely by
the Storm, which may very well happen, do
not you think, Sir, that his rare Figure would
proclaim him the Prince of Ballad Singers, as,
by ju&s;tly depo&s;ing you, he has made him&s;elf
the King of Dunc$s?</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> is &s;o far from &s;inging an Action, that
there is no &s;uch Thing as Action in his whim|&s;ical
Rhap&s;ody, unle&s;s what proceeds from
Dulne&s;s, that is, from Privation; a very pretty
Principle of Action, and very worthy of <HI>P</HI>'s
Invention! The Thing is divided into Three
Books. In the Fir&s;t, in&s;tead of Action there is
De&s;cription and Declamation. In the Third,
in&s;tead of Action we have nothing but a
<PB N="18" REF="25">
feveri&s;h Dream. The Second is made up of
Na&s;tine&s;s, Ob&s;cenity, and Ab&s;urdity; and is
&s;o far from being Part of an Action, that it
runs counter to the De&s;ign of the whole Thing,
if there could be any De&s;ign in it; for Vigour
of Action can never proceed from Dulne&s;s,
though it may from Madne&s;s. The Hero of
the Piece does nothing at all, and never &s;peaks
but once, unle&s;s it be half a Line in the
Third Book. In the Fir&s;t Book, indeed, he
offers to burn his Works, but is hinder'd by
the Godde&s;s: Now tho&s;e Works are either
Good or Bad; if they are Good, they render
him incapable of being King of the Dunces; if
they are Bad, the Offer to burn them &s;hews his
Judgment, and Judgment mu&s;t be always con|trary
to Dulne&s;s, otherwi&s;e <HI>P.</HI> would be the
brighte&s;t Creature that ever God made.</P>
<P>Whether an Epick Poem, is grave or mock
Epick, the Action mu&s;t have Probability in all
its Parts: Both antient and modern Criticks
agree in this.</P>
<P><HI>Ficta voluptatis cau&s;&agrave; &s;int proxima veris,</HI>
&s;ays <HI>Horace, Let every Thing that is invented
to give the Reader Plea&s;ure, be attended with
Probability:</HI> Nay, <HI>Boileau</HI> makes Probability
more nece&s;&s;ary than Truth it&s;elf, as &s;everal of
the Antients and Moderns have likewi&s;e done.</P>
<Q><L>Jamais au &s;pectateur n'offrez rien d'incroyable,</L>
<L>Le vrai peut quelque fois n'etre pas vrai &s;em|blable.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="26">
Une merveille ab&s;urde e&s;t pour moy &s;ans appas,</L>
<L>L'e&s;prit n'e&s;t point em&ugrave; de ce q'il ne croit pas.</L></Q>
<P>Never offer any thing that is incredible ei|ther
to the Reader or the Spectator. Truth
&s;ometimes may not have Probability. That
which is ab&s;urd, at the &s;ame Time that 'tis
wonderful, has no Charms for me. The Soul
is never mov'd with that which it does not
believe.</P>
<P>And the Rea&s;on that he gives for this is very
&s;olid, <HI>viz.</HI> Truth may &s;ometimes have the
Appearance of a Lye, but Probability has al|ways
the Appearance of Truth. And this
mock Probability, <HI>Butler</HI> in his <HI>Hudibras,</HI>
and <HI>Boileau</HI> in his <HI>Lutrin</HI> have pre&s;erved in|violably.
But what Probability is there in <HI>P</HI>'s
Rhap&s;ody? What Probability in the Games
which take up a third Part of the Piece? Is it
not mon&s;trous to imagine any Thing like that
in the Ma&s;ter Street of a populous City; a
Street eternally crowded with Carriages, Carts,
Coaches, Chairs, and Men pa&s;&s;ing in the
greate&s;t Hurry about Private and Publick
Affairs? What Probability in that noble Inven|tion
of <HI>Fleet Ditch,</HI> which, be&s;ides i$s Extra|vagancy,
and its Stupidity, &s;hews the na&s;ty
Soul of the Author.</P>

<P><HI>P.</HI> talks of <HI>Taylor</HI> the Water-Poet, but

<HI>P.</HI> is properly the Water-Poet, who has Water-Language,

purpo&s;e to learn it from his Daily tran&s;itory
Ma&s;ters, the Scullers.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry I have dwelt &s;o long upon this
whim&s;ical Trifle, call'd, <HI>The Publi&s;her to the
Reader;</HI> which could have been writ by
neither <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> nor <HI>Turk,</HI> nor <HI>Jew,</HI> nor
any one but an Anti-Chri&s;tian Catholick, edu|cated
in Je&s;uitical Maxims, and Religious
Frauds. I appeal to any Man of common
Sen&s;e, if this whim&s;ical Fraud could have been
printed &s;o many times in <HI>Duodecimo,</HI> as the
Author pretends it has been, and in&s;erted at
la&s;t in the Appendix to the Edition in Quarto,
if it had been writ by any one but <HI>P.</HI> him&s;elf.
This appears to me to be utterly impo&s;&s;ible:
And the Truth appears &s;o plainly, and &s;trikes
the Reader &s;o &s;trongly through that pa$try Ar|tifice,
<PB N="21" REF="28">
that if <HI>P.</HI> believes that he conceals him|&s;elf
by it, he &s;hews him&s;elf a thou&s;and times
more weak, and expo&s;es him&s;elf infinitely more
than by any thing that he can &s;ay in Rhyme;
for there are &s;everal Per&s;ons who believe, that
any Sort of Fiction is allowable in Rhyme; but
all the World expects, that when a Man writes
Pro&s;e, he &s;hould &s;peak Truth and Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>As we have &s;hewn that <HI>P.</HI> knows nothing
of the Art of Poetry in general, we now come
to &s;hew, that he knows as little of <HI>Homer</HI> in
particular, whether we con&s;ider the Qualities
and Character of that celebrated <HI>Grecian,</HI> or
the Nature of his Writings; and, in &s;hort, as
little of the Characters of other Poets, whether
ancient or modern. And the impartial Rea|der
will then determine whether the Author
who has all the&s;e Defects, is qualified to &s;et up
for a Tran&s;lator of <HI>Homer,</HI> or for a knowing,
a ju&s;t, and a judicious Critick.</P>
<P>What <HI>P.</HI> is pleas'd to call his Preface, is
neither a ju&s;t Di&s;&s;ertation, nor a mode&s;t En|comium,
but an extravagant hyperbolical Pa|negyrick
on <HI>Homer;</HI> a Heap of dogmatical,
elaborate, illiterate Pedantry: By which he
has equally labour'd to &s;hew the Excellence of
<HI>Homer,</HI> and to expo&s;e and detect his own Un|worthine&s;s.
For there is not in the Tran&s;lation
he lea&s;t Shadow of tho&s;e great Qualities which
either are, or are pretended to be, in <HI>Homer.</HI>
And yet <HI>P.</HI> at the &s;ame Time that he is ex|tolling
him to the Skies, gives infallible Signs
<PB N="22" REF="29">
that he does not know him, and blindly &s;ays
more infamous Things of him, than either
<HI>Terra&s;&s;on, Le Motte,</HI> or <HI>Perrault.</HI></P>
<P>When the Prefacer tells us, in his very fir&s;t
Paragraph, that <HI>Hom$r</HI> is univer&s;ally allow'd
to have had the greate&s;t Invention of any
Writer whatever, he is &s;o far from telling us,
at the &s;ame Time, what Invention is, that he
plainly di$covers that he knows nothing of it.
For he &s;eems to take it for a peculiar Faculty
of the Mind, di&s;tinct from Memory, Ima|gination,
and Judgment; whereas it is the Ef|fect
and Re&s;ult of the confederate Powers and
Operation of all the three. We have a faint
Image of the&s;e Operations in Hawking: For
Memory may be ju&s;tly compar'd to the Dog
that beats the Field, or the Wood, and that
&s;tarts the Game; Imagination to the Falcon
that<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A Term in <HI>Falconry.</HI></NOTE> clips it upon its Pinions after it; and Judg|ment
to the Falconer, who directs the Flight,
and who governs the whole. But <HI>P.</HI> as has
been &s;aid, takes it for a di&s;tinct Faculty; he
oppo&s;es it to Judgment in this very Paragraph;
and in the la&s;t Paragraph of the third Page,
[<HI>Edit.</HI> 2.] he calls it the &s;trong and the ruling
Faculty.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> tells us, in the fir&s;t Page of this wonderful
Preface, that whatever Prai&s;es may be given to
Works of Judgment, there is not a &s;ingle
Beauty in them, but is owing to the Invention.
But he ought to have known that this is reci|procal;
<PB N="23" REF="30">
and that in Works of Invention there
is not a &s;ingle Beauty but is owing to the
Judgment; and that is the Rea&s;on that none
have had great Beauties, but who have had
great Judgment; as <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and
&s;ome few others of the ancient <HI>Grecian</HI>
and <HI>Roman</HI> Poets, and &s;ome very few of the
<HI>Engli&s;h, French,</HI> and <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P>In the Beginning of the &s;econd Page of
the Preface, [Edition the 2d] <HI>P.</HI> is pleas'd to
tell us, <HI>That the Rea&s;on why mo&s;t Criticks are
inclin'd to prefer a judicious and methodical
Genius to a great and fruitful one, is, becau&s;e
they find it ea&s;ier to pur&s;ue their Ob&s;ervations
through a uniform and bounded Walk of Art,
than to comprehend the va&s;t and various Ex|tent
of Nature.</HI> Fine Words without any
Meaning! As if any one could comprehend
the va&s;t and various Extent of Nature, but the
great Author of Nature. If this Prefacer had
not been &s;uperlatively ignorant, he would
have known, that the mo&s;t judicious and me|thodical
Genius's have been the greate&s;t and
the mo&s;t fruitful ones; the mo&s;t admirable,
and the mo&s;t &s;ublime. The Epick Poems of
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> are infallible Proofs of this.</P>
<P>Our Author's Work is a wild Paradi&s;e;
[<HI>&s;ays</HI> P. <HI>towards the Top of his 2d Page,</HI>]
where, if we cannot &s;ee all the Beauties &s;o
di&s;tinctly as in an order'd Garden, it is only
becau&s;e the Number of them is infinitely great|er.
'Tis like a copious Nur&s;ery which contains
<PB N="24" REF="31">
the Seeds and fir&s;t Productions of every Kind,
out of which, tho&s;e who follow'd him have
but &s;elected &s;ome particular Plants, each ac|cording
to his particular Fancy, to cultivate
and beautify. If &s;ome Things are too luxu|riant,
'tis owing to the Richne&s;s of the Soil;
and if others are not arriv'd to Perfection or
Maturity, it is only becau&s;e they are over-run
and oppre&s;s'd by tho&s;e of a &s;tronger Nature.</P>
<P>Now I appeal to you, Sir, if this is not a
Paragraph which &s;hews an Ignorance as gro&s;s
and profund as <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Darkne&s;s: An Ig|norance
which may be felt, tho' it cannot be
under&s;tood. No <HI>Indian,</HI> no <HI>Negro,</HI> no <HI>Hot|tentot,</HI>
knows le&s;s of <HI>Homer,</HI> than <HI>P.</HI> But
what you and I will be pleas'd with, is this,
that as the Author of this Paragraph has af|fronted,
abus'd, and &s;lander'd &s;everal young
Ladies, which alone is &s;ufficient to &s;hew him

ju&s;tly ordain'd that a Lady &s;hould revenge the

<P>What! <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> is <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem then, ac|cording
to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> an indige&s;ted Heap of
Beauties, without Order or Symmetry; a
Piece of Ground upon which nothing but
Seeds, and nothing perfect or accompli&s;h'd, is
to be found; a Production loaded with many
<PB N="25" REF="32">
&s;uperfluous and unprofitable Things, which
ought to be retrench'd, and which oppre&s;s or
disfigure tho&s;e which ought to be pre&s;erv'd?</P>
<P>The mo&s;t inveterate Enemies to <HI>Homer,
&s;ays that judicious Lady,</HI> never &s;aid any thing
more injurious, or more unju&s;t, again&s;t that
Poet.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P.</HI> will pardon me, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> if I op|po&s;e
the three Compari&s;ons in this erroneous
Preface, which &s;eem to me to be very fal&s;e,
and utterly contrary to what the greate&s;t an|cient
and modern Criticks have thought.</P>
<P>To the Point, then, <HI>&s;he continues;</HI> The
<HI>Iliad</HI> is &s;o far from being a wild Paradi&s;e, that
it is the mo&s;t regular Garden, and laid out
with more Symmetry than ever any Garden
was. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Notre</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Gardener to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. He laid out the Gardens of <HI>Ver|&s;ailles</HI> and <HI>Marly.</HI></NOTE>, who was the
greate&s;t Man of the World in his Art, never
ob&s;erv'd in his Garden a more perfect, or more
admirable Symmetry, than <HI>Homer</HI> has ob&s;erv'd
in his Poems. Every thing that is in them, is
not only in the Place in which it ought ju&s;tly
to be, but every thing is formed on Purpo&s;e
for the Place it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. He pre&s;ents you at
fir&s;t with that which ought fir&s;t to be &s;een; he
places in the Middle what ought to be only
there, and what would be improper either at
the Beginning or End; and he places Things
at a greater Di&s;tance, which ought to be &s;o
<PB N="26" REF="33">
di&s;pos'd, in order to create a greater and a
more agreeable Surprize; and to make u&s;e of
a Compari&s;on drawn from Painting, <HI>He di&s;|po&s;es
that in the greate&s;t Light, which cannot
be too vi&s;ible; and &s;inks and hides in the Ob|&s;curity
of the Shadows, what does not require
to be expos'd &s;o fully to Sight. So that we may
&s;ay, that</HI> Homer <HI>was the Painter who be&s;t
knew how to employ the Lights and the Sha|dows.
And it was this beauteous and admi|rable
Order, which</HI> Horace <HI>admir'd in his Po|ems,
and upon which he founded his Rules for
the perfecting the Art of Poetry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The &s;econd Compari&s;on, (&s;he continues) is
as unju&s;t.</HI> How could Mr. <HI>P.</HI> affirm that one
can di&s;cover only Seeds, and the immature Pro|ductions
of every Kind, in the <HI>Iliad?</HI> when
every Beauty in that Poem is &s;o perfect a
Beauty, that the following Ages could find
nothing to add to any Kind of his Excel|lencies?
And the Ancients have always pro|pos'd
<HI>Homer</HI> as the mo&s;t perfect Model, in
every Kind of Poetry.</P>
<P><HI>The third Compari&s;on (&s;he &s;till continues)
is every Jot as unju&s;t, and is compos'd of the
Errors of the two former. Homer</HI> had un|doubtedly
an incomparable Fertility of Inven|tion,
but yet a Fertility which is always re|&s;train'd
by a ju&s;t and &s;incere Judgment,
which made him reject every &s;uperfluous
Thing which his boundle&s;s Imagination could
offer to him, in order to retain only what was
<PB N="27" REF="34">
u&s;eful or nece&s;&s;ary. Judgment guided the
Head of this admirable Gardiner, and was
the Pruning-Hook he made u&s;e of in cutting
off every u&s;ele&s;s Branch from its Trunk. He
has done what <HI>Horace</HI> &s;peaks of in his <HI>Epods,</HI>
<Q>Inutile&s;que &s;alce ramos amputans
Faeliciores in&s;erit.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P, &s;he continues,</HI> had in an extraor|dinary
manner oblig'd us, if he had directed
us to the &s;uperfluous Branches that ought to
be cut off from this Tree: If he had in|&s;tructed
us in the Symmetry, which ought to
be given to that wild Garden, to render it
more regular; if he had given us an Idea of
that Perfection which he &s;ays is wanting to
tho&s;e &s;everal Beauties, of which <HI>Homer,</HI> he
pretends, has only given us a Sketch. It
would be happy for the pre&s;ent Age, and glo|rious
to <HI>England,</HI> to have produced &s;o perfect
a Critick.</P>
<P>Thus far Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> has defended <HI>Homer;</HI>
&s;he next proceeds to defend her&s;elf again&s;t the
&s;en&s;ele&s;s Cavil which he has brought again&s;t
her; which &s;he has done with all the Mode&s;ty,
the Ju&s;tne&s;s, and the Addre&s;s which are pecu|liar
to that judicious Lady. You have &s;een
that Defence in the Original. I have nothing
to do but to ob&s;erve here, that the Wretch
again&s;t whom &s;he writes, has been always in|famous
for his Ingratitude to that Part of the
<PB N="28" REF="35">
Fair Sex, to whom he has had mo&s;t Obliga|tions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to &s;end you &s;ome Re|marks
of my own upon this Preface.</P>
<P>'Tis in the &s;econd Page of it likewi&s;e that
this Pre$acer informs us, <HI>That 'tis to the
Strength of this amazing Invention, that
we are to attribute that unequal'd Fire and
Rapture, which is &s;o forcible in</HI> Homer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
But, by <HI>P</HI>'s Leave, <HI>Homer</HI> owes his Invention
to his Fire, and not his Fire to his Invention:
The more warm any one is by Nature, the
more inventive is that Per&s;on, if the Organs
be rightly di&s;pos'd.</P>
<P>But <HI>P.</HI> goes on, <HI>What he,</HI> that is <HI>Homer,
writes,</HI> [that is, every thing that he writes]
<HI>is of the mo&s;t animated Nature imaginable.</HI>
At the Bottom of this very Page he contra|dicts
this. For, &s;ays he, <HI>'tis remarkable that
his Fancy, which is every where vigorous, is
not di&s;cover'd immediately at the Beginning of
his Poem, in its fulle&s;t Splendour.</HI> But let us
return to what he &s;ays previous to this Con|tradiction
of him&s;elf. <HI>If a Council be call'd,</HI>
&s;ays <HI>P, or a Battle fought, you are not coldly
inform'd of what is &s;aid or done, as from a
third Per&s;on; the Reader is hurried out of
him&s;elf, by the Force of the Poet's Imagina|tion,
and turns in one Place to a Hearer,
in another to a Spectator.</HI> To &s;hew the Ab|&s;urdity
of this, we &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider it with
Regard to Councils, and afterwards with Re|gard
<PB N="29" REF="36">
to Battels. If every thing that is &s;aid in
Council is of the mo&s;t animated Nature ima|ginable,
the Characters of tho&s;e who &s;peak,
either cannot be maintain'd, or cannot be diver|&s;ify'd.
And as for Battels, the Reader is as
much a Spectator of tho&s;e of <HI>Virgil,</HI> as he is
of tho&s;e of <HI>Homer.</HI> The Mu&s;e who pre&s;ides
over Epick Poetry equally relates both. And
if &s;he relates the De&s;truction of <HI>Troy</HI> by the
Mouth of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> that was not a Battle
but a Ma&s;&s;acre. And the Nece&s;&s;ity of the
Action requir'd that Way of relating it; it
being impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et otherwi&s;e before the
Eyes of <HI>Dido,</HI> a thing that was pa&s;t and done
in a different Part of the World.</P>
<P>This little Gentleman &s;ays, towards the
Top of the third Page of the &s;maller Edition,
<HI>That exact Di&s;po&s;ition, ju&s;t Thought, correct
Elocution, poli&s;h'd Numbers, may have been
found in a thou&s;and; but this poetical Fire,
this</HI> Vivida Vis Animi <HI>in a very few.</HI></P>
<P>If he had &s;tudied Twenty Years to be in
the Wrong, he could not have blunder'd
more confoundedly. The very Rever&s;e of
what he a&s;&s;erts is the Truth. Exact Di&s;po&s;i|tion,
ju&s;t Thought, correct Elocution, po|li&s;h'd
Numbers have been found in <HI>Homer</HI>
and <HI>Virgil</HI> alone, of all that have writ in the
Epick Way; but the poetical Fire, the <HI>Vivida
Vis Animi</HI> may have been &s;een in a Thou&s;and.
But let me &s;ee how the little Gentleman goes
on. <HI>Even in Works where all the&s;e are im|perfect
<PB N="30" REF="37">
or neglected, this even over-powers
Critici&s;m, and makes us admire while we di&s;|approve.</HI>
Admirably &s;aid, little <HI>Bays,</HI> $i'faith,
thou &s;econd great Apo&s;tle of Non&s;en&s;e, which
thou art &s;ent by thy evil Genius to preach to
all thy Hundred thou&s;and Admirers! But,
<HI>faveamus Linguis,</HI> let me &s;ee how he goes
on, full of the 'foremention'd God, who&s;e
mi&s;&s;ionary Prie&s;t he has the Honour to be.
<HI>Nay, where this</HI> [Fire] <HI>appears, tho' attended
with Ab&s;urdities, it brightens all the Rubbi&s;h
about it, 'till we &s;ee nothing but its own
Splendor.</HI> Now, did <HI>Bays</HI> the fir&s;t ever &s;ay
any thing &s;o full of admirable Judgment as
this? Can we &s;ufficiently admire a Fire that
brightens all the Rubbi&s;h about it, 'till the
Rubbi&s;h di&s;appears, and is hid by its own
Brightne&s;s? But in the Name of Non&s;en&s;e,
let him go on. <HI>This Fire is di&s;cern'd in</HI> Vir|gil,
<HI>but di&s;cern'd as through a Gla&s;s, reflected
from</HI> Homer, <HI>more &s;hining than fierce, but every
where equal and con&s;tant.</HI> What Devil po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
him, when he wrote &s;uch Stuff as this?
The dulle&s;t Devil, and the mo&s;t egregious
Dunce in all the Profund of Hell. What
does he mean by, this Fire is di&s;cern'd in
<HI>Virgil,</HI> but di&s;cern'd as <HI>through</HI> a Gla&s;s, in|&s;tead
of as <HI>from</HI> a Gla&s;s? What does he mean
by reflected from <HI>Homer?</HI> How is the Fire
in the Fourth, the Sixth, the Tenth <HI>Eclogue</HI>
reflected from <HI>Homer?</HI> or the Fire of
tho&s;e noble Pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Georgicks;</HI> the
Death of <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> the Prai&s;e of <HI>Italy,</HI> or a
<PB N="31" REF="38">
Country Life; or the Plague among the dumb
Creation; or the Story of <HI>Orpheus?</HI> How
comes this trifling Poeta&s;ter, without the lea&s;t
Sagacity or Penetration, to make tho&s;e Di|&s;tinctions
and tho&s;e Di&s;coveries, which the
greate&s;t and the mo&s;t judicious Criticks could
never make? How much Rea&s;on have we
here to cry out with my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common;</HI>
<Q><L>How many Ages &s;ince has <HI>Virgil</HI> writ?</L>
<L>How few are they who under&s;tand him yet?</L>
<L>Approach his Altars with Religious Fear;</L>
<L>No vulgar Deity inhabits there.</L>
<L>Heav'n &s;hakes not more at <HI>Jove</HI>'s imperial Nod</L>
<L>Than Poets &s;hould before their <HI>Mantuan</HI> God.</L>
<L>Hail, mighty <HI>Maro!</HI> may that &s;acred Name</L>
<L>Kindle my Brea&s;t with thy Coele&s;tial Flame.</L></Q></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI> &s;peaks not of <HI>Virgil</HI>
as of a Poet who&s;e Fire was di&s;cern'd as thro'
a Gla&s;s, becau&s;e my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common,</HI> felt
the Fire of that admirable Poet. What does
this <HI>Twickenham</HI> Poeta&s;ter mean, when he
&s;peaks of the Fire of <HI>Virgil,</HI> as more &s;hining
than fierce, and as of a Fire every where equal
and con&s;tant? The Fire of a great and judi|cious
Poet is caus'd by his Ideas, and therefore
can never be equal and con&s;tant, becau&s;e the
Ideas cannot po&s;&s;ibl$ be always equal. What?
Is the Fire of <HI>Virgil</HI> every where equal to that
Divine Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Cumaean</HI> Sybil, in the
Sixth <HI>Aeneid?</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="32" REF="39">
<L>Ventum erat ad limen, cum virgo, Po&s;cere fata</L>
<L>Tempus, ait: Deus, ecce, Deus. Cui talia fanti</L>
<L>Ante fores, &s;ubito non vul$us, non color unus,</L>
<L>Non comptae man&s;ere comae: &s;ed pectus anhelum,</L>
<L>Et rabie fera corda tument; majorque videri,</L>
<L>Nec mortale &s;onans: afflata e&s;t numine quando</L>
<L>Jam propriore Dei.</L></Q>
<P>Which my Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI> has thus finely
imitated, in his admirable E&s;&s;ay on Tran&s;lated
Ver&s;e:
<Q><L>Have you been led thro' the <HI>Cumaean</HI> Cave,</L>
<L>And heard th' impatient Maid divinely rave?</L>
<L>I hear her now; I &s;ee her rowling Eyes;</L>
<L>And panting; Lo! the God, the God, &s;he
cries;</L>
<L>With Words not hers, and more than human
Sound,</L>
<L>She makes th' obedient Gho&s;ts peep trembling
thro' the Ground.</L></Q></P>
<P>But now let us come to <HI>Milton,</HI> in whom,
if we will believe this little Gentleman, <HI>the
poetical Fire glows like a Furnace, kept up to
an uncommon Fiercene&s;s by the Force of Art.</HI>
Now, I dare engage that there are not Two
Per&s;ons in the World who under&s;tand what
the little Gentleman &s;ays there, and I do really
believe that there is not one. What? is the
Tran&s;cendency of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Genius, which has
<PB N="33" REF="40">
been admir'd by all the capable World, re|duced
to Art? Pray, how is the Fire of <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
and <HI>Virgil</HI> kept up? for they &s;eem to me
to have va&s;tly more of the poetical Art than
<HI>Milton.</HI> Indeed <HI>Milton</HI> had more Felicity than
they, which threw him upon the Subject of
<HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t;</HI> a Subject which often fur|ni&s;h'd
him with the greate&s;t Ideas, which &s;up|ply'd
him with the greate&s;t Spirit. But to &s;hew
that it was rather Felicity than Art or Skill,
that determin'd him to that Choice, he was
by no means &s;o happy in the Choice of <HI>Pa|radi&s;e
Regain'd,</HI> a Subject that could &s;upply
him neither with the Ideas nor with the Spi|rit.
For Pride and Ambition, Rage and Re|venge,
and Fury, furni&s;h'd quite another &s;ort
of Spirit, than Patience, Re&s;ignation, Humi|lity,
Meekne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering, and the re&s;t
of tho&s;e quiet divine Virtues that adorn the
Chri&s;tian Scheme. Be&s;ides, <HI>Milton</HI>'s Fire is
&s;o very far from being kept always up by Art,
that for near a &s;ixth Part of the Poem it's &s;et
down for want of Art. For this Poem is
&s;o order'd, that the Subject of the Eleventh
and Twelfth Books could by no means &s;upply
him with the great Ideas, nor con&s;equently
with the great Spirit, which the Fir&s;t, Second,
and Sixth had done before; and &s;everal Parts
of the other Books likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>It would require a Volume to expo&s;e all
the numerous Errors and Blunders which are
$o be met with in his Preface. At the Bot|tom
<PB N="34" REF="41">
of his Third Page he tells us, <HI>That</HI> Homer
<HI>open'd a new and boundle&s;s Walk for his Ima|gination,
and created a World for him&s;elf in
the Invention of Fable: That which</HI> Ari&s;totle
<HI>calls the Soul of Poetry, was fir&s;t breath'd
in it by</HI> Homer. And here that Learned and
Judicious Lady finds Two Faults in that A&s;&s;er|tion.
Fir&s;t, &s;he condems the Fu&s;tian in it, be|cau&s;e
it rai&s;es no clear and di&s;tinct Idea in her
Mind; and &s;econdly, &s;he cen&s;ures the Fal&s;e|hood
in it. <HI>There is not,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>the lea&s;t
Shadow of Truth in a&s;&s;erting, that</HI> Homer
<HI>invented the Fable. It was invented long
before his Time; and he found the U&s;e of it
wholly e&s;tabli&s;h'd, as I have &s;hewn in my
Preface to the</HI> Ody&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now leave Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> for a Mo|ment,
in order to return to her again imme|diately.</P>
<P>The fourth and the fifth Pages of the 'fore|mention'd
Edition, are taken up with a mo&s;t im|pertinent
Divi&s;ion of Fable, into the Probable,
the Allegorical, and the Marvellous, which Divi|&s;ion
I &s;uppo&s;e he had from &s;ome Popi&s;h Pe|dant,
and perhaps, from the &s;acred Scaramou|chi
his Preceptor. Now, in the fir&s;t Place, he
makes the Allegorical a di&s;tinct Species of Fa|ble,
whereas there cannot po&s;&s;ibly be any
Fable, that is, any Action founded upon a
Moral, but what is allegorical. In the &s;econd
Place, in the Epick Fable [which is of the
&s;ame Nature with the <HI>Ae&s;opian</HI> Fables, and
<PB N="35" REF="42">
is di&s;tingui&s;h'd only by its Length] that is,
in the Epick Action founded upon its Moral,
the&s;e Three Qualities, of Allegorical, Proba|ble,
Admirable are united. What Rea&s;on
then can this Author have to make the&s;e
Three &s;o many di&s;tinct Species of Fable, in|&s;tead
of making them Three di&s;tingui&s;h'd Qua|lities
of the Epick Fable, of which alone
'tis his Bu&s;ine&s;s to treat here? The Fable of
an Epick Poem, is very ju&s;tly defin'd, a Di&s;|cour&s;e
invented by Art, to form the Manners
by the Allegory of an Action, related in an
agreeable, a profitable, and a wonderful
Manner.</P>
<P><HI>In treating of the marvellous Fable [for a
Pedant naturally affects ob&s;olete Words,] he
&s;peaks of the Machines of</HI> Homer, <HI>concerning
which he is pleas'd to tell us,</HI> That whatever
Cau&s;e there might be to blame them in a phi|lo&s;ophical
or a religious View, they are &s;o per|fect
in the poetical, that Mankind have been
ever &s;ince contented to follow them; none have
been able to enlarge the Sphere of Poetry be|yond
the Limits which he has &s;et. Every
Attempt of this Nature has prov'd un&s;ucce&s;s|ful;
and after all the various Changes of
Times and Religions, his Gods continue to this
Day, the Gods of Poetry.</P>
<P>What a mon&s;trous Mixture of Ignorance
and Impudence is here? In the Compa&s;s of
Eight Lines there are no le&s;s than Four gro&s;s
Errors. The fir&s;t is this, <HI>That Mankind have
<PB N="36" REF="43">
been contented to follow,</HI> or [to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>]
<HI>to make u&s;e of</HI> Homer'<HI>s Machines ever &s;ince</HI>
Homer'<HI>s Time;</HI> whereas all the World knows,
that <HI>Ta&s;&s;o, Milton, Cowley,</HI> and &s;everal more
have made u&s;e of very different ones. The
&s;econd Error is this: <HI>None have been able to
enlarge the Sphere of Poetry beyond the Li|mits
which he has &s;et.</HI> I neither under&s;tand
this, nor can I meet with any one who does
under&s;tand it: What does <HI>P.</HI> mean by that
Cant and that Fu&s;tian, <HI>enlarging the Sphere of
Poetry,</HI> and <HI>&s;etting Limits to the Sphere of
Poetry?</HI> Now, downright Non&s;en&s;e is cer|tainly
the greate&s;t of all Errors and Blunders.
In other Errors <HI>Pega&s;us</HI> only trips or &s;tumbles,
but in Non&s;en&s;e, the Bea&s;t falls flat down, and
flounders in the Mud.</P>
<P>Now follows the Third Error. <HI>Every At|tempt,</HI>
&s;ays <HI>P, of this Nature has prov'd
un&s;ucce&s;sful.</HI> That is, every Attempt to make
u&s;e of other Machines than what <HI>Homer</HI> has
made u&s;e of. Now, but two of the ancient
Poets, who have writ in the Epick Way, have
&s;ucceeded with the heathen Machines, and
tho&s;e are <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and as many of
the Moderns have &s;ucceeded without tho&s;e
Machines, and tho&s;e are <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI>
who&s;e Machines are almo&s;t entirely taken from
the Chri&s;tian Scheme. And their Succe&s;s is
a Proof from Fact of the Fourth Error, and
is an inconte&s;table one, that the Gods of <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
do not continue to this Day to be the
<PB N="37" REF="44">
Gods of Poetry. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible that any one
at this Time could write an Epick Poem with
heathen Machines &s;ucce&s;sfully. There would
be great Folly in attempting it, becau&s;e the
U&s;e of &s;uch Machines would be de&s;tructive not
only of Truth, but of all Probability. As
for <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> when they writ, they
had Probability on their Side. And it would
be high Inju&s;tice to condemn them for not
fore&s;eeing what 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they could fore|&s;ee,
the univer&s;al Change of Religion.</P>
<P>There is another egregious Blunder of <HI>P</HI>'s,
in the Eighth Page of the &s;maller Edition,
which Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> has with ju&s;t Severity
cen&s;ur'd. <HI>Every thing in the</HI> Iliad, &s;ays <HI>P,
has Manners, as</HI> Ari&s;totle, &s;ays he, <HI>expre&s;&s;es
it; that is, every thing is acted or &s;poken.
Nothing,</HI> &s;ays Madam <HI>Dacier, can be more
contrary to the Doctrine of that Philo&s;opher.</HI>
He never &s;aid that any thing has Manners,
<HI>becau&s;e it is either acted or &s;poken.</HI> On the
contrary he tells us, <HI>that there are Di&s;cour&s;es
without Manners, and that, in his Time,
there were &s;everal Dramatick Pieces without
Manners, and that yet there were in tho&s;e
Pieces both Action and Di&s;cour&s;e; a certain
Sign,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that Manners are neither Acti|on
nor Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ince Action and Di&s;cour&s;e
may be without Manners. What then are
Manners,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>according to that Philo&s;o|pher?</HI>
Manners then, &s;ays <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> are the
Things that di&s;cover the Inclination of him
<PB N="38" REF="45">
who &s;peaks, and the Choice that he is bent
and determin'd to make on Occa&s;ions in
which it would not be ea&s;y to &s;ee what he
will $ollow, and what he will avoid.</P>
<P>I come now to the &s;econd Preliminary, that
I propos'd to take Notice of, which is call'd,
<HI>A Letter to the Publi&s;her,</HI> and &s;ign'd <HI>W. C.</HI>
but was undoubtedly writ by <HI>P.</HI> him&s;elf. For
it is &s;o full of Folly, Fal&s;hood, and Impu|dence,
and the Flattery to <HI>P.</HI> is &s;o ful&s;ome
and &s;o nau&s;cous, that there is not a Man in
<HI>England</HI> who is Fool enough to offer that
Incen&s;e to <HI>P.</HI> but him&s;elf. And that he
him&s;elf is very capable of it, we &s;hall give
an undeniable Proof anon.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Will. Cleland,</HI> I know not whether
there is &s;uch a worthy Per&s;on in the World
or not. But if there is, he will be certainly
oblig'd to me for taking the Fool's Cap from
his own Head, and clapping it upon the Pate
of <HI>P,</HI> who is mo&s;t worthy of it. I have nei|ther
Time nor Inclination to go thro' all the
Paragraphs; but I &s;hall repeat Two or Three
of them, which will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew the
vile and filthy Fal&s;hood of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them is in the Middle of the
Sixth Page, of the Edition in <HI>Quarto,</HI> and
begins with the&s;e Words: <HI>I perceiv'd that
mo&s;t of the&s;e Authors had been</HI> [doubtle&s;s very
wi&s;ely] <HI>the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;ors:</HI> Both you and I,
Sir, have the Honour to know &s;everal of
them, of whom we know this to be fal&s;e.
<PB N="39" REF="46">
But give me leave to acquaint you with what
has pa&s;s'd between that little envious mi&s;chie|vous
Creature and my&s;elf. At his fir&s;t com|ing
to Town, he was very importunate with the
late Mr. <HI>Henry Cromwell</HI> to introduce him to
me: The Recommendation of Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI>
engaged me to be about thrice in Company
with him; after which I went into the Coun|try,
and neither &s;aw him nor thought of him,
'till I found my&s;elf mo&s;t in&s;olently attack'd by
him, in his very &s;uperficial E&s;&s;ay upon Criti|ci&s;m,
which was the Effect of his impotent
Envy and Malice, by which he endeavour'd to
de&s;troy the Reputation of a Man who had
publi&s;h'd Pieces of Critici&s;m, and to &s;et up
his own. I was mov'd with Indignation to
that Degree, at &s;o much Ba&s;ene&s;s, that I im|mediately
writ Remarks upon that E&s;&s;ay, in
order to expo&s;e the Weakne&s;s and the Ab&s;ur|dity
of it; which Remarks were publi&s;h'd, as
&s;oon as they could be printed. I afterwards
writ and publi&s;h'd Remarks upon Part of his
Tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer,</HI> upon his <HI>Wind&s;or Fo|re&s;t,</HI>
and his infamous <HI>Temple of Fame.</HI> When
I had done this, I thought I had Rea&s;on to
be &s;atisfied with the Revenge I had taken.
As the&s;e &s;everal Remarks had made great Im|pre&s;&s;ions
upon the Minds of Per&s;ons of un|doubted
Sen&s;e, and &s;o e&s;teem'd by the Pub|lick,
<HI>P.</HI> began to repent of the Affront he
had offer'd me, and the Injury he had at|tempted
to do me: And to give &s;ome Proofs
<PB N="40" REF="47">
of his Repentance, he &s;ub&s;crib'd to the
Two Volumes of Select Works, almo&s;t in
&s;pite of my Friend Mr. <HI>Henry Cromwell,</HI> in
who&s;e Hands he found the Propo&s;als. He
likewi&s;e &s;ub&s;crib'd afterwards to the Two Vo|lumes
of Letters, which engag'd me to &s;trike
out &s;everal very ju&s;t and &s;evere Reflections
again&s;t him, which were &s;catter'd up and down
in tho&s;e Letters. In Acknowledgment of
which, he &s;ent me the following Letter, to|gether
with the &s;econd Payment:</P>
<LETTER>

<P><PB N="41" REF="48">
And now, Sir, perhaps you may be of
Opinion that I had Rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied,
and to regard Mr. <HI>P.</HI> as a Friend. I indeed
from that Hour ceas'd to be his Enemy, but
could not put an entire Confidence in him,
as often as I reflected on a Piece of mon&s;trous
Perfidy, which he had been guilty of &s;even
Years before; of which I &s;hall give you as
short an Account as I can. The great Suc|ce&s;s
of Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Cato</HI> fermented his Envy,
and provok'd his Malice exceedingly. To di&s;|charge
&s;ome Part of his Spleen, he goes to
Mr. <HI>Lintot</HI> the Book&s;eller, and per&s;uades him
to engage me to write &s;ome Remarks upon
Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s Play. He prevail'd upon the
Book&s;eller, and the Book&s;eller upon me. I
need not acquaint you that I wrote and pub|li&s;h'd
&s;uch Remarks. But his Gratitude for my
complying with his Reque&s;t, may, perhaps,
be a Piece of News, that will not a little &s;ur|prize
you: He writes a very &s;currilous and im|pertinent
Pamphlet, in which he acquaints his
Reader, that I was in the Hands of Dr. <HI>Norris,</HI> a
Curer of mad People, at his Hou&s;e in <HI>Hat|ton-Garden,</HI>
tho' at the &s;ame Time I appear'd
publickly every Day both in the Park and in
the Town. The Manu&s;cript of this Pamphlet
he offer'd to &s;hew to Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> before it
was printed, who had too much Honour, and
too much good Sen&s;e to approve of &s;o
black a Proceeding. He was &s;o far from
<PB N="42" REF="49">
approving of it, that he immediately engag'd
Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> to write the following
Letter to <HI>Lintot.</HI></P>
<LETTER>

<P>MR. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> de&s;ir'd me to tell you, that

way of Dr. <HI>Norris</HI>'s Account. When he thinks
fit to take Notice of Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s Objecti|ons

<P>This Letter was &s;ent by Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI>

<HEAD>To Mr. DENNIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>Thur&s;day April 24, 1729.</DATE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Mr. <HI>Alexander Pope</HI>'s new Edition of
his <HI>Dunciad, with Notes and Additions,</HI>
I find he has done me the Honour to make
me your great Friend and Second, in many
Places of that extraordinary Piece; an Honour
I could not expect: But as he has therein
charg'd me with Facts of which I am innocent,
on account of my <HI>Lives of the Poets,</HI> and
violently attack'd the Reputations of &s;everal
ingenious Gentlemen, endeavouring to render
me the Author of his Scandal, I am to clear
up the&s;e Matters, which are of &s;ome Impor|tance,
by a ju&s;t Vindication of my &s;elf and
others, and a thorough Detection of this great
Slanderer.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with an Enquiry into <HI>Pope</HI>'s
Calumny again&s;t you. He, in his <HI>Dunciad,</HI>
Book the 2d, would per&s;uade the Publick that
your &s;elf had a Hand in the &s;mall Encomium
on your Character in&s;erted in the 1&s;t Volume
of my <HI>Lives of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Poets,</HI> where I
&s;ay in general, <HI>That you are a Per&s;on of &s;ound
Learning, Ma&s;ter of a great deal of Pene|tration
and Judgment, and perfectly regular
in all your Performances;</HI> with a few parti|cular
<PB N="45" REF="52">
Ob&s;ervations, on the <HI>Ju&s;tne&s;s</HI> of the
De&s;ign, <HI>Conduct,</HI> and Moral of your <HI>Plays:</HI>
The lea&s;t, give me Leave to tell you, that
could be &s;aid in your Behalf, by any impar|tial
Writer, who had any Knowledge of you,
or your Works: But this &s;canty Prai&s;e of you,
is thought a great deal too much, by the &s;elfi&s;h
Mr. <HI>Pope;</HI> wherefore he at length in&s;inuates,
that you are the Author of it, which is a ma|licious
and &s;candalous In&s;inuation, without the
lea&s;t Foundation of Truth; for I do &s;olemnly
declare [without any previous Sollicitation
what&s;oever] that you knew nothing at all
thereof, till the Book was printed, and pub|li&s;h'd
by the Book&s;eller.</P>
<P>Now to demon&s;trate how far the invidious
Charge, which he endeavours to fix upon you,
and other Poets, belongs to him&s;elf only, I
&s;hall here relate the true &s;ecret Hi&s;tory con|cerning
him&s;elf. In <HI>The Lives of the Poets,</HI>
Vol. II. p. 145, 146, 151, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Sentences
following are by his Authority: <HI>This excellent
Poet,</HI> [Alexander Pope] <HI>who&s;e Fame exceeds
not his Merit,</HI> was born, <HI>&amp;c. There is great
Ea&s;e, Strength, Wit, and Judgment, in his
Compo&s;itions; all his Pieces are univer&s;ally
applauded, and the great</HI> Sheffield <HI>a&s;&s;erted his
Work. His private Character is the be&s;t,</HI> be|ing
&s;umm'd up in a good Companion, <HI>and a
firm Friend. Mr.</HI> Pope <HI>has Fire and Spirit
equal to that great Undertaking, his Tran|&s;lation
of</HI> Homer: <HI>And he is excellent in Pro&s;e
<PB N="46" REF="53">
as well as Ver&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. That the&s;e high Prai&s;es
and Commendations of him&s;elf were by him
particularly approv'd of, in a printed Proof of
his Life and Character, which I tran&s;mitted to
him for his Correction, I am ready to make
Oath of, if requir'd; and by his Alterations
and Additions therein, he entirely made the
Compliment his own; which now I under|&s;tand
he, in his abundant Mode&s;ty, judges too
little, tho' his great Superiors, in any Ac|counts
of them, would have been very well
contented with le&s;s.</P>
<P>I did every Thing in my Power, by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>
who was generally thought to be a ri&s;ing Ge|nius,
to honour and oblige him; much more
than by Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> who&s;e
Favour and Friend&s;hip I happily procur'd, and
which continued till their Deaths. But <HI>Pope</HI>
is not a <HI>Prior,</HI> nor a <HI>Congreve,</HI> and I may
venture to &s;ay, never will be: For as he is evi|dently
deficient of their poetical Talents and
Abilities, &s;o he is a perfect Stranger to their
Gratitude, Honour, and great Humanity, the
mo&s;t &s;hining Parts of the&s;e excellent Mens
Characters.</P>
<P>The Reward of my good Offices by <HI>Pope,</HI>
has been the greate&s;t Abu&s;e he could invent.
It &s;eems the envious little Gentleman is angry
with me for pre&s;uming to &s;ay any thing in
Favour of others. Here's the Center and
Fountain of his Malice. Truly he can bear
no Character in Competition with his own,
e&s;pecially &s;ince the above-mention'd Poets have
<PB N="47" REF="54">
been dead, in who&s;e Life-times he dared not
to publi&s;h his Impudence and Non&s;en&s;e: Tho'
now he fancies him&s;elf <HI>Lord over all,</HI> and, like
<HI>King Bambridge,</HI> late Warden of the <HI>Fleet</HI> Pri|&s;on,
he endeavour'd to exerci&s;e the mo&s;t ty|rannick
Government within his imaginary Ju|ri&s;diction.
He has done all in the Compa&s;s
of his Malice, to defame, injure, and beat
down every one he knew, except his Friend
and Confederate the ingenious <HI>John Gay,</HI> on
Pretence of my accu&s;ing of whom, for tel|ling
the Truth of that extraordinary Gentle|man,
I have the great and di&s;proportion'd
Share of his violent Invectives which run thro'
his <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> lately printed, and
&s;ome of his Tran&s;lations, one might imagine
he intended to claim the &s;ole Prerogative of
Blundering to him&s;elf. His Blunders in mo&s;t
of his Performances, are very manife&s;t! And
therefore he calls others Blunderers, and Fools,
in &s;o polite a Manner, as not to be parallell'd
or imitated. The Lines upon me in his &s;tupid
Poem, are very harmle&s;s, tho' very maliciou&s;ly
aim'd; for as to my being a Blunderbu&s;s of
Law, this cannot go for any thing, even with
the weake&s;t of his Readers and Admirers; be|cau&s;e
they, with others, will, I think, be
oblig'd to own, that the great Poet <HI>Alexander
Pope,</HI> is no Judge of Law, nor can he make
it appear that what he hath &s;aid of me, was
ever e&s;teem'd any Part of my Character. So
that on this ju&s;t Rea&s;oning I am clear of his
<PB N="48" REF="55">
Satire, (which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on &s;ome Grounds
of Truth) altho' not of his Abu&s;e.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to &s;ay how long Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>
was writing of his <HI>Dunciad;</HI> but his great
Malice again&s;t me, has been ten Years hatch|ing
and laying up, &s;o as not to be brought to
Light till the <HI>Beggars Opera,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> and
Company was acted in the Theatre; which
low and licentious dramatical Piece, de&s;ign'd
for the Encouragement of Gentlemen on the
Highway, and their female A&s;&s;ociates, in <HI>Dru|ry-Lane,</HI>
by its extraordinary Novelty, hap|pening
to &s;trike the giddy Humour of the
Town, has introduc'd a new Species of the
vile&s;t Farce, and turn'd the Heads of both
<HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Gay</HI> (who clubb'd their Wit in that
Performance) &s;ince which, their Pride is be|come
intolerable to all Men of common Sen&s;e.
But the&s;e great poetical Champions in the
Cau&s;e of <HI>Newgate,</HI> will be ju&s;tly pourtraited
in a Supplement to my Account of them in
<HI>The Lives of the Poets.</HI></P>
<P>When I writ and publi&s;h'd my <HI>Hi&s;torical
Regi&s;ter in my Lives of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Poets,</HI>
which is &s;o long ago as 1719, I endeavour'd
to act the candid Part by every Author I
could get ea&s;y Intelligence of; and whatever
mean Opinion Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> may have at any
Time have conceiv'd of me, he had once &s;ome

would not have enter'd into any Corre|&s;pondence

Your Humble Servant,
<SIGNED>GILES JACOB.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I need not ob&s;erve to you, Sir, that there
are three Things remarkable in this Letter.
The fir&s;t, which I hinted at in the Introduction
to it, is, that there are Per&s;ons in the World
who are impudent and unju&s;t to that Degree,
as to throw their own Crimes in the Faces of
innocent Per&s;ons. The &s;econd, which I like|wi&s;e
hinted at above, is that Mr. <HI>P.</HI> is prov'd
by Facts atte&s;ted by a Per&s;on of great Since|rity,
to be his own Trumpeter. The third is,
that Mr. <HI>P.</HI> has a very great Soul, a Soul ex|alted
as much above Gratitude, as above Ju&s;|tice
or Mode&s;ty. The Gentleman who wrote
this Letter, in Complai&s;ance to Mr. <HI>P,</HI> gives
him a Character which they both very well
knew that he was far from de&s;erving. Mr <HI>P,</HI>
by Way of Acknowledgment for this Favour,
acquaints the World, the very fir&s;t Opportu|nity,
that Mr. <HI>Jacob</HI> is a Blunderbu&s;s of Law,
of which <HI>P</HI> does not under&s;tand one Syllable,
as appears both by his Actions, and by his
Writings; which are all of them as contrary
<PB N="50" REF="57">
to Law, as they are to Rea&s;on and Equity. If
<HI>P.</HI> had call'd him a Blunderer in Critici&s;m,
Men of Sen&s;e would have been apt to have
believ'd him, before they had perus'd Mr. <HI>Ja|cob</HI>'s
Letter.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>P.</HI> has been pleas'd in &s;everal Places
of his wonderful <HI>Rhap&s;ody,</HI> to declare that I
wrote &s;uch and &s;uch Things in Concert
with the late Mr. <HI>Gildon,</HI> I here &s;olemnly
declare, upon the Word and Honour of a
Gentleman, that I never wrote &s;o much as
one Line, that was afterwards printed, in
Concert with any one Man what&s;oever. I here
&s;end you the Copies of two Letters, which I
receiv'd formerly from Mr. <HI>Gildon,</HI> by which
it will plainly appear to one of your Di&s;cern|ment,
that we are not Writers in Concert with
each other.</P>

Now, Sir, is it not plain that any one who
&s;ends &s;uch Compliments to another, has not
been us'd to write in Partner&s;hip with him to

<P>I come now to the two Paragraphs in the

him&s;elf, to <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> becau&s;e he
is call'd <HI>Sawny.</HI> But there are the following
<HI>trifling</HI> Differences between that great <HI>French|man,</HI>
and our little <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bard.</P>
<P>I. <HI>Boileau</HI> has as much or more of the Prin|ciples
of good Writing in Poetry, than any
<HI>French</HI> Poet whatever. The Principles of
good Writing according to <HI>Horace,</HI> are
good Sen&s;e, Judgment, and Moral Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> has le&s;s of the&s;e good Qualities than
any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poet whatever; there being no
&s;uch Thing as Judgment or good Sen&s;e to be
found in his trifling Productions.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Boileau</HI> has a great deal of Art, as well
as Genius; <HI>P.</HI> has neither Art nor Genius.
Art is always the Effect of Judgment; and
there never was a great Genius for Poetry,
without great Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="60">
III. The Cen&s;ures of <HI>Boileau</HI> are always
ju&s;t, and therefore his are ju&s;t and legitimate
Satires. The Cen&s;ures of <HI>P.</HI> are unju&s;t to
the very Height of Impudence, and there|fore
<HI>P</HI>'s Invectives are malicious and infa|mous
Libels.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Boileau</HI> prai&s;es as many of the
<HI>French</HI> Poets as he &s;atirizes, and not only
tho&s;e who died before he wrote, as <HI>Marot,
St. Gelais, Malherbe, Racan, Reigner,</HI> but
likewi&s;e his Contemporaries, as <HI>Corneille, Ra|cine,
Moliere, La Fontaine, Segrais, Bea&s;e|rade,</HI>
and likewi&s;e the principal Writers of
Pro&s;e that liv'd in his Time, as the great Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Pa&s;call, Ablancourt, Patru,</HI> and <HI>La
Bruyere.</HI> But <HI>Pope</HI> never commended any
of his Contemporaries, unle&s;s two or three
contemptible Wretches in his own Cabal,
but like an <HI>Indian</HI> that runs a Muck, endea|vours
to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate both Friend and Foe, 'till
he meets with the <HI>Indian</HI>'s Fate.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Boileau</HI> &s;peaks always of him&s;elf, with
Humility, Mode&s;ty, and Di&s;cretion. <HI>Pope</HI>
&s;peaks of him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t Pride and
Folly, and arrogant Impudence.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>Boileau</HI> has generou&s;ly commended an
Author that was very poor, as <HI>Patru,</HI> who
was a fine, though unfortunate Genius. Nay,
he not only generou&s;ly commended that Au|thor,
&s;o far celebrated for the Delicacy of his
Writings, but acted by him more generou&s;ly
than he &s;poke. And when he was reduced
<PB N="54" REF="61">
by the Cruelty of his Creditors, to part with
his choice Library, which he had been &s;o long
in collecting; <HI>Boileau</HI> mo&s;t honourably laid
down the Price of it, and gave <HI>Patru</HI> the En|joyment
of it, for the re&s;t of his Life. But
neither the Action nor the Commendation is
in <HI>Pope</HI>'s little and &s;ordid Soul, or his envi|ous,
malicious, and in&s;olent Nature.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>Boileau</HI> has Numbers, <HI>Pope</HI> has none.
The <HI>Pega&s;us</HI> of <HI>Boileau</HI> has all its Paces: The
<HI>Pega&s;us</HI> of <HI>Pope,</HI> like a <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Po&s;t-Hor&s;e,
is always upon the <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as has been
ob&s;erv'd formerly.</P>
<P>VIII. <HI>Boileau</HI> allows tho&s;e whom he &s;ati|rizes
to have their Merit, and their good Qua|lities,
and had more of the Gentleman as well
as the fine Writer in him, than to call them
either Dunces, or Blockheads, or Fools. Such
Language becomes none but the Boors and
Clowns of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us;</HI> and therefore neither
<HI>Quinaut,</HI> nor <HI>St. Amant,</HI> nor <HI>Brebeuf,</HI> nor
<HI>Scudery,</HI> nor <HI>Chapelain</HI> had any &s;uch from him,
nor any other Writer whom he has attack'd
in his Satires.</P>
<P>The following Pa&s;&s;age in one of his Prefa|ces
is a convincing Proof of this.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall content my&s;elf with putting the
Reader in Mind of one thing, which 'tis
convenient he &s;hould know; which is, that,
by attacking in my Satires, the Defects of ma|ny
of the Writers of the Age in which
we live, I never pretended by doing that, to
<PB N="55" REF="62">
deprive the&s;e Writers of the Merit and the
good Qualities which they may otherwi&s;e
have. I never pretended, I &s;ay, that <HI>Chape|lain,</HI>
tho' a wretched Poet enough, did not
formerly write, I know not by what means,
an Ode that was not contemptible, and that
there was neither Wit nor Agreeablene&s;s
in the Works of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Quinaut,</HI> tho'
very far remov'd from the Perfection of <HI>Vir|gil.</HI>
I am oblig'd to add concerning the
latter, that at the Time in which I wrote
again&s;t him we were both very young, and
that he afterwards publi&s;h'd &s;everal Works,
which got him ju&s;t Reputation. I am like|wi&s;e
ready to own, that there is Genius in
the Writings of <HI>St. Amant,</HI> of <HI>Brebeuf,</HI> of
<HI>Scudery,</HI> and of &s;everal others, whom I have
criticiz'd, and who, as well as my&s;elf, richly
de&s;erve to be criticiz'd. In a Word, with
the &s;ame Sincerity with which I have rallied
them for their Defects, I am willing to
allow whatever they may have that is excel|lent.
And thus, I hope, I have done them
Ju&s;tice, and have convinc'd the Reader, that
it was not a Spirit of Envy or Calumny that
caus'd me to write again&s;t them.&endq;</P>
<P>IX. <HI>Boileau</HI> has not made &s;candalons Re|flections
upon the Lives of innocent Per&s;ons,
as <HI>P.</HI> has done, which the ingenious and &s;aga|cious
Author of <HI>Pope Alexander's Supremacy</HI>
has very ju&s;tly ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="63">
X. <HI>Boileau</HI> was plac'd, by his great Qua|lities,
highly above tho&s;e whom he &s;atiriz'd,
whereas <HI>P.</HI> is many Degrees below &s;everal of
tho&s;e whom he has libell'd; below <HI>Philips</HI>
as a Writer of Pa&s;torals; below You as a Cri|tick,
an Editor, a modern Dramatick Poet,
or a Tran&s;lator of ancient Poetry. For if
your Tran&s;lation of <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> is equal to
the <HI>Specimen</HI> which I have &s;een of it, of
which I make no doubt; it may make him
blu&s;h for his Tran&s;lation of <HI>Homer.</HI> And if
neither of you have had a Sub&s;cription ad|equate
to your Merits, 'tis becau&s;e in this wi&s;e
and judicious Age, the Age of <HI>Opera's,</HI> of
<HI>Beggars Opera's,</HI> of <HI>Dunciads,</HI> and <HI>Hurlo|thrumbo's,</HI>
'tis not in the Nature of Things
at pre&s;ent, and con&s;equently an Impo&s;&s;ibility,
that any Author can have a generous Sub|&s;cription
to a Work that highly de&s;erves it.</P>
