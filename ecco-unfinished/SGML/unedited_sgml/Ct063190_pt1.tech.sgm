<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN one offers to the public the labours of another per&s;on,
it is allowable and precedented to expatiate in prai&s;e of the
work. Of this indulgence however I &s;hall not make ad|vantage.
The indu&s;try of Mr. Vertue was &s;ufficiently known: the
antiquarian world had &s;ingular obligations to him. The many valu|able
monuments relating to our hi&s;tory, and to the per&s;ons of our mo|narchs
and great men, which he &s;aved from oblivion, are la&s;ting evi|dences
of his merit. What thanks are due to him for the materials of
the following &s;heets, the public mu&s;t determine. So far from endea|vouring
to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s them in favour of the work, it &s;hall be my part
fairly to tell them what they mu&s;t expect.</P>
<P>In Italy, where the art of painting has been carried to an amazing
degree of perfection, the lives of the painters have been written in num|berle&s;s
volumes, alone &s;ufficient to compo&s;e a little library. Every pic|ture
of every con&s;iderable ma&s;ter is minutely de&s;cribed. Tho&s;e bio|graphers
treat of the works of Raphael and Corregio with as much
importance as commentators &s;peak of Horace or Virgil; and indulging
them&s;elves in the inflated &s;tyle of their language, they talk of pictures
as works almo&s;t of a divinity, while at the &s;ame time they lament them
<PB N="vi" REF="7" MS="Y">
as peri&s;hing before their eyes. France, neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch ma&s;ters,
nor &s;o hyperbolic in their diction, contrives however to &s;upply by va|nity
what is wanting in either. Pou&s;&s;in is their miracle of genius; Le
Brun would di&s;pute precedence with half the Roman &s;chool. A whole
volume is written even on the life and works of Mignard. Voltaire,
who under&s;tands almo&s;t every thing, and who does not &s;u&s;pect that
judgment in painting is one of his deficiences, &s;peaks ridiculou&s;ly in
commendation of &s;ome of their performers.</P>
<P>This country, which does not always err in vaunting it's own produc|tions,
has not a &s;ingle volume to &s;how on the works of it's painters.
In truth, it has very rarely given birth to a genius in that profe&s;&s;ion.
Flanders and Holland have &s;ent us the greate&s;t men that we can boa&s;t.
This very circum&s;tance may with rea&s;on prejudice the reader again&s;t a
work, the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of which mu&s;t be to celebrate the arts of a
country which has produced &s;o few good arti&s;ts. This objection is &s;o
&s;triking, that in&s;tead of calling it <HI>The Lives of Engli&s;h Painters,</HI> I
have &s;imply given it the title of <HI>Anecdotes of Painting in England.</HI> As
far as it an&s;wers that term, perhaps it will be found curious. The in|defatigable
$ains of Mr. Vertue left nothing unexplored that could il|luminate
his &s;ubject, and collaterally led him to many particularities
that are at lea&s;t amu&s;ing: I call them no more, nor would I advi&s;e any
man, who is not fond of curious trifles, to take the pains of turning
over the&s;e leaves. From the antiquarian I expect greater thanks; he is
more cheaply plea&s;ed than a common reader: the one demands to be
diverted, at lea&s;t in&s;tructed&mdash;the other requires only to be informed.</P>
<P>Mr. Vertue had for &s;everal years been collecting materials for this
work: He conver&s;ed and corre&s;ponded with mo&s;t of the virtuo&s;i in
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
England; he was per&s;onally acquainted with the olde&s;t performers in
the &s;cience; he minuted down every thing he heard from them. He
vi&s;ited every collection, made catalogues of them, attended &s;ales, co|pied
every paper he could find relative to the art, &s;earched offices, re|gi&s;ters
of pari&s;hes and regi&s;ters of wills for births and deaths, turned
over all our own authors, and tran&s;lated tho&s;e of other countries which
related to his &s;ubject. He wrote down every thing he heard, &s;aw, or
read. His collections amounted to near forty volumes large and
&s;mall: In one of his pocket-books I found a note of his fir&s;t intention
of compiling &s;uch a work; it was in 1713; he continued it a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly
to his death in 1757. The&s;e MSS. I bought of his widow after his
decea&s;e; and it will perhaps &s;urprize the reader to find how near a
compleat work is offered to him, though the re&s;earch was commenced
at &s;o late a period: I call it commenced; what little had been done
before on this &s;ubject, was &s;o far from a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it was &s;carce of u&s;e.
The &s;ketch, called, <HI>An E&s;&s;ay towards an Engli&s;h School,</HI> at the end of
the tran&s;lation of Depiles, is as &s;uperficial as po&s;&s;ible; nor could a fact
&s;carce be borrowed from it 'till we come to very modern times. In
general I have been &s;crupulous in acknowledging both Mr. Vertue's
debts and my own. The catalogues of the works of Hollar and Simon,
and tho&s;e of the collection of King Charles I. King James II. and the
Duke of Buckingham, were part of Mr. Vertue's original plan, which
is now compleated by the&s;e volumes.</P>
<P>The compiler had made &s;everal draughts of a beginning, and &s;everal
lives he had written out, but with no order, no connection, no accu|racy;
nor was his &s;tyle clear or correct enough to be offered to the
reader in that unpoli&s;hed form. I have been obliged to compo&s;e
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
a-new every article, and have recurred to the original fountains from
whence he drew his information; I mean, where it was taken from
books. The indige&s;ted method of his collections, regi&s;tered occa&s;io|nally
as he learned every circum&s;tance, was an additional trouble, as I
was forced to turn over every volume many and many times, as they
laid in confu&s;ion, to collect the articles I wanted; and for the &s;econd
and third parts, containing between three and four hundred names, I
was reduced to compo&s;e an index my&s;elf to the forty volumes. One
&s;atisfaction the reader will have, in the integrity of Mr. Vertue; it
exceeded his indu&s;try, which is &s;aying much. No man living, &s;o bi|gotted
to a vocation, was ever &s;o incapable of fal&s;hood He did not
deal even in hypothe&s;is, &s;carce in conjecture. He vi&s;ited, and revi&s;ited
every picture, every monument, that was an object of his re&s;earches;
and being &s;o little a &s;lave to his own imagination, he was cautious of
tru&s;ting to that of others. In his memorandums he always put a quaere
again&s;t whatever was told him of &s;u&s;picious a&s;pect; and never gave cre|dit
to it 'till he received the fulle&s;t &s;atisfaction. Thus whatever trifles
the reader finds, he will have the comfort of knowing that the greate&s;t
part at lea&s;t are of mo&s;t genuine authority. Whenever I have added
to the compiler's &s;tores, I have generally taken care to quote as religi|ou&s;ly
the &s;ource of my intelligence. Here and there I have tried to
enliven the dryne&s;s of the &s;ubject by in&s;erting facts not totally foreign
to it. Yet upon the whole I de&s;pair of it's affording much entertain|ment.
The public have a title to whatever was de&s;igned for them: I
offer this to them as a debt&mdash;nobody will &s;u&s;pect that I &s;hould have
cho&s;en &s;uch a &s;ubject for fame.</P>
<P>If the ob&s;ervation of a dearth of great names in this li&s;t &s;hould ex|cite
emulation, and tend to produce abler ma&s;ters, Mr. Vertue, I be|lieve,
<PB N="ix" REF="10">
and I &s;hould be glad to have the continuation of the work do
greater honour to our country. It would be difficult perhaps to a&s;&s;ign
a phy&s;ical rea&s;on, why a nation that produced Shake&s;pear, &s;hould owe
it's glory in another walk of genius to Holbein and Vandyck. It can|not
be imputed to want of protection: Who countenanced the arts
more than Charles the Fir&s;t? That Prince, who is cen&s;ured for his want
of ta&s;te in pen&s;ioning Quarles, is celebrated by the &s;ame pen for em|ploying
Bernini&mdash;but want of protection is the apology for want of
genius: Milton and Fontaine did not write in the ba&s;k of court-favour.
A poet or a painter may want an equipage or a villa, by wanting pro|tection:
They can always afford to buy ink and paper, colours and
pencils. Mr. Hogarth has received no honours, but univer&s;al admi|ration.</P>
<P>But whatever has been the complaint formerly, we have ground to
hope that a new aera is receiving it's date. Genius is countenanced,
and emulation will follow; Nor is it a bad indication of the flouri&s;h|ing
&s;tate of a country, that it daily makes improvements in arts and
&s;ciences. They may be attended by luxury, but they certainly are pro|duced
by wealth and happine&s;s. The conveniences, the decorations of
life are not &s;tudied in Siberia, or under a Nero. If &s;evere morality
would at any time expect to e&s;tabli&s;h a thorough reformation, I fear it
mu&s;t chu&s;e inho&s;pitable climates, and aboli&s;h all latitude from the
laws. A corporation of merchants would never have kept their oaths
to Lycurgus of ob&s;erving his &s;tatutes 'till he returned. A good go|vernment,
that indulges it's &s;ubjects in the exerci&s;e of their own
thoughts, will &s;ee a thou&s;and inventions &s;pringing up, refinements will
follow, and much plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction will be produced at lea&s;t be|fore
that exce&s;s arrives, which is &s;o ju&s;tly &s;aid to be the forerunner of
<PB N="x" REF="11">
ruin. But all this is in the common cour&s;e of things, which tend to
perfection, and then degenerate. He would be a very ab&s;urd legi&s;la|tor,
who &s;hould pretend to &s;et bounds to his country's welfare, le&s;t it
&s;hould peri&s;h by knowing no bounds. Poverty will &s;tint it&s;elf; riches
mu&s;t be left to their own di&s;cretion; they depend upon trade, and to
circum&s;cribe trade is to annihilate it. It is not rigid nor Roman to &s;ay
it, but a people had better be unhappy by their own fault, than by that
of their government. A <HI>Cen&s;or morum</HI> is not a much greater ble&s;&s;ing
than an <HI>Arbiter elegantiarum.</HI> The world, I believe, is not at all agreed
that the au&s;terities of the Pre&s;byterians were preferable to the licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s
under Charles II. I pretend to defend the one no more than
the other; but I am &s;ure that in the body politic, &s;ymptoms that prog|no&s;ticate
ill, may indicate well. All I meaned to &s;ay was, that the di&s;|po&s;ition
to improvements in this country is the con&s;equence of its' vi|gour.
The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;ociety for the encouragement of arts
will produce great benefits before they are perverted to mi&s;chiefs.
The bounties be&s;towed by that &s;ociety, for facilitating the nece&s;&s;aries
of life to the poor, for encouraging the u&s;e of our own drugs and ma|terials,
or for naturalizing tho&s;e of other countries, are be&s;towed on
noble principles and with patriot views. That &s;ociety does not ne|glect
even the elegancies of life: Arts that are innocent in them&s;elves,
and beneficial to the country, either by adding value to our produc|tions,
or by drawing riches as they invite &s;trangers to vi&s;it us, are
worthy the attention of good citizens; and in all tho&s;e lights that &s;o|ciety
acts upon a national and exten&s;ive plan.</P>
<P>The art, that is chiefly the &s;ubject of the&s;e pages, is one of the lea&s;t
likely to be perverted: Painting has &s;eldom been employed to any bad
purpo&s;e. Pictures are but the &s;cenery of devotion. I que&s;tion if Ra|phael
<PB N="xi" REF="12">
him&s;elf could ever have made one convert, though he had ex|hau&s;ted
all the expre&s;&s;ion of his eloquent pencil on a &s;eries of popi&s;h
doctrines and miracles. Pictures cannot adapt them&s;elves to the
meane&s;t capacities, as unhappily the tongue can. Non&s;en&s;e may make
an apprentice a catholic or a methodi&s;t; but the apprentice would &s;ee
that a very bad picture of St. Francis was not like truth; and a very
good picture would be above his feeling. Pictures may &s;erve as helps
to religion; but are only an appendix to idolatry; for the people mu&s;t
be taught to believe in fal&s;e gods and in the power of &s;aints, before
they will learn to wor&s;hip their images. I do not doubt but if &s;ome
of the fir&s;t reformers had been at liberty to &s;ay exactly what they
thought, and no more than they thought, they would have permitted
one of the mo&s;t ingenious arts implanted in the heart of man by the Su|preme
Being to be employed towards his prai&s;e. But Calvin by his te|nure,
as head of a &s;ect, was obliged to go all lengths. The vulgar will
not li&s;t but for total contradictions: They are not &s;truck by &s;eeing re|ligion
&s;haded only a little darker or a little lighter. It was at Con&s;tan+tinople
alone where the very &s;hopkeepers had &s;ubtlety enought to fight
for a letter more or le&s;s in a Greek adjective<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the decline of the empire there were two &s;ects who proceeded to the greate&s;t violences again&s;t each other in the di&s;pute whether the nature of the &s;econd per&s;on was <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, co-e&s;&s;entialis; or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;imilis e&s;&s;entiae.</NOTE> that expre&s;&s;ed an ab&s;tract
idea. Happily at this time there is &s;o total an extinction of all party-animo&s;ity
both in religion and politics, that men are at liberty to pro|po&s;e
whatever may be u&s;efull to their country, without it's being impu|ted
to them as a crime, and to invent what they mean &s;hould give
plea&s;ure without danger of di&s;plea&s;ing by the very attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="13">
At this epoch of common &s;en&s;e, one may rea&s;onably expect to &s;ee the
arts flouri&s;h to as proud a height as they attained at Athens, Rome, or
Florence. Painting has hitherto made but faint Efforts in England.
Our eloquence and the glory of our arms have been carried to the
highe&s;t pitch. The more peacefull arts have in other countries gene|rally
attended national glory. If there are any talents among us, this
&s;eems the cri&s;is for their appearance: The Throne it&s;elf is now the altar
of the graces, and whoever &s;acrifices to them becomingly, is &s;ure that
his offerings will be &s;miled upon by a Prince, who is at once the exam|ple
and patron of accompli&s;hments. The in&s;titution of a &s;chool of
&s;tatuary in the hou&s;e of a young<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Richmond.</NOTE> Nobleman of the fir&s;t rank rivals the
boa&s;ted munificence of foreign Princes. When we abound with heroes,
orators and patrons, it will be hard if their images are not tran&s;mitted
to po&s;terity under gracefull repre&s;entations.</P>
<P>This is by no means &s;aid to depreciate the arti&s;ts we have, but to in|&s;pire
with emulation tho&s;e ari&s;ing. Ry&s;brack, Roubiliac, Scheemaker,
Wilton, would do honour to any country: But hitherto their &s;kill has
been in a manner confined to private monuments. When we have &s;ub|jects
for hi&s;tory, the people &s;hould read on public edifices the actions
of their ance&s;tors and fellow-citizens in ba&s;reliefs: Bu&s;ts and &s;tatues
&s;hould reward the galant behaviour of the brave, and exhibit them as
models. What made Rome more venerable than every &s;treet being an
illu&s;tration of Livy? Painting has been circum&s;cribed within as &s;elfi&s;h
bounds as &s;tatuary; hi&s;toric compo&s;itions totally neglected. Reynolds
and Ram&s;ay have wanted &s;ubjects, not genius. There is another arti&s;t,
who &s;eems born for an age of naval glory, and is equal to it, Mr. Scott.
<PB N="xiii" REF="14">
Architecture, the mo&s;t &s;uitable field in which the genius of a people,
arrived at &s;uperiority, may range, &s;eems reviving. The ta&s;te and &s;kill
of Mr. Adam is formed for public works. Mr. Chambers's treati&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On civil architecture, folio, 1759.</NOTE>
is the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible book and the mo&s;t exempt from prejudices that ever
was written on that &s;cience. But of all the works that di&s;tingui&s;h this
age, none perhaps excell tho&s;e beautifull editions of Balbec and Palmy|ra&mdash;not
publi&s;hed at the command of a Louis quatorze, or at the ex|pence
of a cardinal nephew, but undertaken by private curio&s;ity and
good &s;en&s;e, and tru&s;ted to the ta&s;te of a poli&s;hed nation. When I en|deavour
to do ju&s;tice to the editions of Palmyra and Balbec, I would not
confine the encomium to the &s;culptures; the books have far higher me|rit.
The mode&s;t de&s;criptions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By Mr. Wood.</NOTE> prefixed are &s;tandards of writing: The
exact mea&s;ure of what &s;hould and &s;hould not be &s;aid, and of what was
nece&s;&s;ary to be known, was never comprehended in more clear diction,
or more elegant &s;tile. The pomp of the buildings has not a nobler air
than the &s;implicity of the narration.&mdash;but I mu&s;t re&s;train my&s;elf; tho'
it is plea&s;ing to expatiate on the ju&s;t prai&s;e of one's country; and they
who cannot perform great things them&s;elves, may yet have a &s;atisfaction
in doing ju&s;tice to tho&s;e who can. If Juvenal was hone&s;t in his &s;atires,
he would have been hapy if he could have lived to write the panegy|ric
of Trajan.</P>

<P>THEY who undertake to write the Hi&s;tory of any art, are fond
of carrying it's origine as far back as po&s;&s;ible. When This
tends to &s;how the improvements made in it, by comparing
latter works with the fir&s;t rude inventions, it may be of &s;ervice; but
it often happens that the Hi&s;torian thinks the antiquity of a di&s;covery
reflects honour on his country, though perhaps his country has been &s;o
carele&s;s or has wanted genius &s;o much, as to have refined very little on
the original hints. Some men pu&s;h this farther, and venerate the fir&s;t
dawnings of an art more than it's productions in a riper age. The
inventor may have had more genius, but the performances of the im|prover
mu&s;t be more perfect. Mr. Vertue had taken great pains to
prove that painting exi&s;ted in England before the re&s;toration of it in
Italy by Cimabue. If what we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it in tho&s;e ignorant times
could be called painting, I &s;uppo&s;e Italy and every nation in Europe re|tained
enough of the deformity of the art to conte&s;t with us in point of
antiquity. That We had gone backwards in the &s;cience farther almo&s;t
than any other country, is evident from our coins, on which there is no
more of human &s;imilitude, than an infant's fir&s;t &s;crawl of the profile of
<PB N="2" REF="17">
a face; and &s;o far therefore as badne&s;s of drawing approaches to anti|quity
of ignorance, we may lay in our claim to very ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
As Italy has &s;o long excelled us in the refinement of the art, &s;he may
leave us the enjoyment of original imperfection.</P>
<P>However, as Mr. Vertue's partiality flowed from love of his coun|try,
and as this is de&s;igned for a work of curio&s;ity, not of &s;peculation
and rea&s;oning, I &s;hall faithfully lay before the reader &s;uch materials as
that laborious antiquarian had ama&s;&s;ed for deducing the Hi&s;tory of

I cannot pa&s;s over the prince&s;s Eleanor, &s;o much celebrated by our

without mentioning the cro&s;&s;es erected to her memory, which Vertue
with great probability &s;uppo&s;ed were built on the de&s;igns of Peter Ca|valini,
a Roman &s;culptor, and whom from various circum&s;tances he
di&s;covered to be the architect of the &s;hrine of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The reader, I am per&s;uaded, will be plea&s;ed to &s;ee how ingeniou&s;ly
my author traced out this hitherto unknown fact.</P>
<P>The original in&s;cription on the tomb ran thus:
<Q><L>Anno milleno Domini cum &s;eptuageno</L>
<L>Et bis centeno, cum completo qua&s;i deno,</L>

<L>Rex fuit Henricus, &s;ancti prae&s;entis amicus.</L></Q></P>
<P>The words <HI>Petrus duxit in actum Romanus civis</HI> were di&s;cernable 'till
very lately. Some old authors a&s;cribe the erection of the &s;hrine to Hen|ry
him&s;elf, others, to Richard de Ware the Abbat, elected in 1260. It
is probable that both were concerned. The new Abbat repaired to
Rome immediately on his election to receive con&s;ecration from Urban
IV. At that time, &s;ays Va&s;ari, flouri&s;hed there Peter Cavalini, a painter
and the inventor of Mo&s;aic, who had performed &s;everal co&s;tly works
in that city. About four years before the arrival of Abbat Ware, that
<PB N="19" REF="34">
is in 1256, had been erected a &s;plendid &s;hrine<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A draught of it by Mr. Talman in the proper colours is pre&s;erved in the fir&s;t volume of the drawings belonging to the Society of Antiquaries. A &s;ketch of it I have among Vertue's MSS.</NOTE> for the martyrs Simpli|cius
and Fau&s;tina, at the expence of John James Capoccio and his
wife, adorned with twi&s;ted columns and inlaid with precious marbles
exactly in the ta&s;te, though not in the preci&s;e form of that of St. Ed|ward.
Nothing is more probable than that a rich abbat, either at his
own expence, or to gratify the ta&s;te of his magnificent ma&s;ter &s;hould
engage a capital arti&s;t to return with him and undertake the &s;hrine of
his ma&s;ter's patron &s;aint, and the great patron of his own church.
Weaver &s;ays expre&s;ly that the abbat brought back with him from
Rome <HI>Workmen</HI> and rich porphyry &s;tones for Edward the Confe&s;&s;or's
feretory; and for the pavement of the chapel<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Before Henry III. began the pre&s;ent church, there had been a rich &s;hrine for the confe&s;&s;or erected by Wiliiam I. as the latter &s;ays expre&s;ly in his charter. Edward had be&s;towed Wind&s;or on the Abbey of We&s;tmin&s;ter; the conqueror, on his acce&s;&s;ion, prevailed on the abbat and convent to re&s;tore Wind&s;or, in ex|change for other lands, being delighted with the &s;cite; &startq;Maxim&egrave; utilis &amp; com|modus e&s;t vi&s;us propter contiguam aquam et &s;ilvam venationibus aptam,&endq; &s;ays he; and after naming the lord&s;hips he gave them, he mentions the gift of an hundred pounds of &s;ilver to compleat and fini&s;h the building of the Abbey, and then adds, &startq;Ob reverentiam nimii amoris quem ego in ip&s;um inclitum regem Edwardum habueram, Tumbum ejus &amp; reginae juxta cum po&s;itae, ex auro et argento fabrili opere arti&s;i$io&s;i decoris mirific&egrave; operiri feci.&endq;</NOTE> This abbat was lord

<L>Abbas Richardus de War&acirc;, qui requie&s;cit</L>

<P>Va&s;ari's &s;ilence on Cavalini's journey to England ought to be no objec|tion;
he not only wrote &s;ome hundred years after the time, but con|founds
his own account &s;o &s;trangely as to make Peter Cavalini &s;cholar
of Giotto, who was twenty years younger. If it may be imagined that
Richard Ware could not have intere&s;t enough to &s;educe &s;o capital a
workman from the &s;ervice of the pope, it might &s;till be accounted for,
by higher authority. Edward I. returning from the Holy Land
was conducted by the king of Sicily to Rome to vi&s;it Gregory X. who
had been Edward's companion and friend in the Holy War. An artful
Pope would certainly be glad to furni&s;h a young king with arti&s;ts who
would encourage him in rai&s;ing &s;hrines and temples. The monument
of Henry III. erected by his &s;on, is beautified in the &s;ame ta&s;te with
porphyry and mo&s;aic; and the fir&s;t brazen &s;tatue known to have been
ca&s;t here, lies upon it. The old paintings round the chapel of St. Ed|ward,
and tho&s;e, in a very beautiful and &s;uperior &s;tyle, though much
decayed, over the ragged regiment, Vertue a&s;cribes to the &s;ame Cava|lini.
This painter and &s;culptor probably, as I have &s;aid, gave the de&s;igns
for the cro&s;&s;es erected by Edward to his beloved Eleanor<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I have &s;ome &s;u&s;picion that a &s;on of Peter Cavalini, is the per&s;on called Peter le Orfever, mentioned in a precept of Edward II. He is there intituled of Stanford, and brought an action again&s;t certain per&s;ons for a&s;&s;ault and battery. As one of
Queen Eleanor's cro&s;&s;es was erected there, it is not improbable that a &s;on of Ca|valini might marry and &s;ettle in that town. See Peck's Stanford, lib. x. &s;ect. 13.</NOTE> Vertue
had drawn them, with a de&s;ign of engraving; I have his original
drawings, I mu&s;t not omit that it was no &s;mall part of Peter Cavalini's
fame, that he made the crucifix that &s;poke to St. Bridget<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Felibien. vol. i. p. 172.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="36">
From all the te&s;timonies above recited, Henry III. appears in a new
light from what has hitherto been known of him. That he was a weak
prince in point of government is indi&s;putable. That he was a great
encourager of the arts, the&s;e records demon&s;trate. When hi&s;torians
talk of his profu&s;ion, they evidence only in what he di&s;&s;ipated on his
favorites. But it is plain that the number and magnificence of his
buildings and palaces mu&s;t have &s;wallowed great part of the &s;ums, ma|liciou&s;ly
charged to the &s;ingle article of unworthy favorites. It matters
not how a prince &s;quanders what he has tyrannically &s;queezed from the
&s;ubject: If he exceeds his revenue, it is almo&s;t as ill &s;pent on edifices
as on mini&s;ters. But it is perhaps no more than ju&s;tice to make &s;ome
allowance for partial or exaggerated relations. Henry was not a wi&s;e
prince&mdash;may I venture to &s;ay more&mdash;He was not a martial prince.
Even in the&s;e more &s;en&s;ible ages one illu&s;trious defect in a king converts
all his other foibles into excellencies. It mu&s;t have done &s;o much more
in a &s;ea&s;on of &s;uch heroic barbari&s;m as that of Henry III. and the want
of an enterprizing &s;pirit in that prince made even his patronage of the
arts be imputed to effeminacy, or be overlooked. The extravagance of
Louis XIV. in his buildings, gardens, water-works, pa&s;&s;ed for an ob|ject
of glory under the canon (if I may &s;ay &s;o) of his ambition. Hen|ry
III. had no conque&s;ts to illuminate his cielings, his halls, his ba&s;re|liefs.
Yet perhaps the generous &s;entiment implied in his motto, <HI>Qui
non dat quod habet, non accipit ille quod optat,</HI> contained more true
glory than all the Fa&s;t couched under Louis's emblem of the &s;un, and
his other o&s;tentatious devices. But let us compare Henry with one
nearer to him. Henry's reign is one of the mo&s;t ignominious in our
annals; That of Edward the I&s;t. of the mo&s;t triumphant. Yet I would
<PB N="22" REF="37">
a&s;k by which of the Two did the nation &s;uffer mo&s;t? By &s;ums lavi&s;hed
on favorites and buildings; or by &s;ums and blood wa&s;ted in unju&s;t
wars? If we look narrowly into Edward's reign, we &s;hall &s;carce<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the Parliamentary Hi&s;tory.</NOTE> find
fewer repre&s;entations again&s;t the tyranny of the &s;on than again&s;t the
encroachments of the father. Who will own that he had not rather
employ ma&s;ter William and Edward of We&s;tmin&s;ter to paint the ge&s;tes
of the kings of Antioch, than imitate the &s;on in his barbarities in
Wales and u&s;urpations in Scotland?</P>

art, though it was certainly pre&s;erved here, at lea&s;t by painting on gla&s;s.
No wonder that a proud, a warlike, and ignorant nobility encouraged
only that branch which atte&s;ted their dignity. Their dungeons were
rendered &s;till darker by their pride. It was the ca&s;e of all the arts;
none flouri&s;hed, but what &s;erved to di&s;play their wealth, or contributed
to their &s;ecurity. They were magnificent without luxury, and pom|pous
<PB N="24" REF="39">
without elegance. Rich plate, even to<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Wickham's crozier at Oxford is an in&s;tance how well the pomp of prelacy was &s;erved by ingenious arti&s;ts. It is certain that in the reigns of the two fir&s;t Edwards there were Greek enamellers in England, who both practiced and taught the art. In Dugdale's Warwick&s;hire, p. 397, 403. are mentioned enamel|led cups very near that period; and &s;ome ancient pieces are &s;till extant. The beautifull cup of gold, enamelled with figures in the habits of the time, given by king John to the corporation of Lynn in Norfolk, and &s;till pre&s;erved there, gives a very favorable idea of the ta&s;te and arti&s;ans of an age, a little antecedent to that I am &s;peaking of. King Alfred's jewel, found at Athelney in Somer&s;et|&s;hire, and of which there is a print in Camden's Britannia, is of much more an|cient date, but of workman&s;hip far more rude. I call it a jewel, becau&s;e it &s;eems to have been u&s;ed as jewels were afterwards, appendent to ribbands. By the cut, I &s;hould take it for engraven gold; Camden, which is extraordinary, does not de&s;cribe the materials, but calls it a picture, which would make one think it was enamelled.</NOTE> the enamelling on gold,
rich &s;tuffs, and curious armour were carried to exce&s;s, while their chairs
were mere pede&s;tals, their cloaths were incumbrances, and they knew
no u&s;e of &s;teel but as it &s;erved for &s;afety or de&s;truction. Their hou&s;es,
for there was no medium between ca&s;tles and hovels, implied the dan|gers

painted before in the beginning of Richard II. 1377, &amp;c.&endq; The&s;e words,
which are very equivocal, &s;tarted a que&s;tion with me, which I found

in oil before John ab Eyck di&s;covered that &s;ecret in 1410? &s;o one
&s;hould think, for what news did the in&s;criber tell, if he only meant that
painting in water-colours or miniature was practiced before painting in
oil? Every illuminated MS. antecedent to that date was a proof of that.
<PB N="27" REF="42">
The &s;hort quaere would be, With what is the picture in que&s;tion
painted? To that I can only reply, that it is covered with gla&s;s, and
is too great a curio&s;ity to have experiments made upon it. It is painted
on a bright golden ground, the colours of the utmo&s;t fre&s;hne&s;s, and
not grown black as oil-colours would be, and is, as I have &s;aid, guarded
by a gla&s;s, all which indicate that it is miniature. Yet I do not pretend
to decide: The in&s;cription I have mentioned and &s;ome other circum|&s;tances
&s;eem to leave a doubt whether John ab Eyck was really the fir&s;t
per&s;on who mixed his colours with oil. We have &s;een by a record re|ported
above, that long before this period oil was at lea&s;t u&s;ed as a var|ni&s;h,
and it is difficult to conceive how it was po&s;&s;ible to varni&s;h with
oil either water-colours or colours mixed with &s;ize. It occured to me to
enquire with what the painters antecedent to John ab Eyck mixed their
colours: Even in this country there are a few pictures extant, and
painted on board, before oil-painting can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been in|troduced
here. Not to mention the picture at Wilton, the other of
Richard II. at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and an undoubted original of Henry IV.
at Hampton-court in Hereford&s;hire, who died within two years after
John ab Eyck's di&s;covery, mu&s;t be allowed to have been drawn before
the new art arrived here. The picture at We&s;tmin&s;ter has indeed been
repainted<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">By one Capt. Broom, a print-&s;eller near the parliament hou&s;e; but this was after Mr. Talman had taken his drawing, from whence the print was engraved.</NOTE>, therefore no conclu&s;ion can be drawn from it. This que|&s;tion,

<P>When they painted on walls, le&s;t their work &s;hould crack, they pro|ceeded
in this manner: They glued a linnen cloth upon the wall, and
covered that with plai&s;ter, on which they painted in di&s;temper: This
was thus prepared: They dropped into the yolk of an egg the milk
that flows from the leaf of a young fig-tree, with which in&s;tead of wa|ter,
gum, or gumdragant, they mixed their la&s;t layer of colours. It is
probable from the la&s;t words of this pa&s;&s;age that they laid their fir&s;t co|lour

<P>Still the much more ancient u&s;e of oil, were it but as a varni&s;h, leaves
a doubt whether John ab Eyck's di&s;covery was entirely his own. The
remarkable record which I have &s;o often mentioned, dates above an
hundred years before the common aera of painting in oil. John ab
Eyck is allowed to have found it in &s;earching for a varni&s;h. Might he
not have heard that &s;uch a varni&s;h or compo&s;ition was in u&s;e in Eng|land?
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I cannot help hazarding a conjecture (though un&s;upported by any of the wri|ters on painting).

If Van Eyck was ever in England, would it not be probable that he learned the &s;ecret of u&s;ing oil here, and took the honour of the invention to him&s;elf, as we were then a country little known to the world of arts, nor at lei&s;ure enough, from the confu&s;ions of the times, to claim the di&s;covery of a &s;ecret which &s;oon made &s;uch fortune abroad? An additional pre&s;umption, though certainly not a proof of Van Eyck's being in England, is a picture in the duke of Devon&s;hire's collection painted by John ab Eyck in 1422, and repre&s;enting the con&s;ecration of St. Tho|mas Becket. The tradition is, that it was a pre&s;ent to Henry V. from his uncle the duke of Bedford, regent of France; but tradition is no proof; and two pic|tures of this author in England, one of them of an Engli&s;h family, and the other of an Engli&s;h &s;tory, are at lea&s;t as good evidence for his having been here, as tra|dition for one of them being painted abroad.

The Painters employed by Henry III. appear to have been Italians, and
yet it is ea&s;y to vindicate the &s;ecret from them, at lea&s;t I can prove that
they mu&s;t have found the practice here, not have brought it over with
them, for we are told expre&s;ly that in Italy they knew of no &s;uch me|thod.

<P>In the reign of Henry VI. our field begins to grow le&s;s barren.
Many portraits of the king him&s;elf are pre&s;erved, as on board at Ken|&s;ington
and on gla&s;s in the chapel of King's college. In my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
is a remarkable piece, which &s;o many circum&s;tances affix to the hi&s;tory
of this prince that I cannot he&s;itate to believe it de&s;igned for him,
though I imagine it was painted after his death. It is the repre&s;enta|tion
of his marriage. There are eleven figures, of which all the heads
are well painted: the draperies are hard and &s;tiff. The king in rich

robes, but with rude di&s;hevelled hair, as are all the men, &s;tands before
the portal of a magnificent church, giving his hand to the queen, who
is far from being a lovely bride, and whom the painter &s;eems &s;atiri|cally
to have in&s;inuated by the prominence of her wai&s;t not to have
been &s;o perfect a virgin as her flowing hair denotes. Kemp arch|bi&s;hop
of York and afterwards of Canterbury, and one of her chief
coun&s;ellors, is performing the marriage rites by holding the pallium
over their conjoined hands. It is remarkable that the prelate wears
thin yellow gloves which are well repre&s;ented. Behind the king in a
robe of &s;tate &s;tands the duke of Gloce&s;ter, and &s;eems reproving a no|bleman,
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He has a hawk on his fi&s;t, a mark of nobility in old paintings.</NOTE> whom I take for the marquis of Suffolk. Behind the
queen is a lady in a kind of turban or diadem, probably de&s;igned for
her mother the titular queen of Naples and Jeru&s;alem. Beyond her,
another in a widow's dre&s;s, oppo&s;ite to whom is a comely gentleman.
This pair I conclude is Jaqueline, duche&s;s of Bedford, widow of duke
John, and her &s;econd hu&s;band. Our hi&s;torian &s;ays that pretty &s;udden|ly
after the duke's death, &s;he married Sir Richard Widville, a goodly
young knight. They were the parents of Elizabeth, queen of Edward IV.</P>
<P>On the fore ground oppo&s;ite to the marqui&s;s of Suffolk &s;tands a
noble virgin, whom I take for Margaret of Richmond, mother of
Henry VII. one of the charges again&s;t the marquis of Suffolk was,
that he endeavoured to marry his &s;on to this lady Margaret, a prince&s;s
of the blood. Near the archbi&s;hop is a cardinal, who is certainly
Winche&s;ter, the king's great uncle. The face is very like the image
on his tomb at Winche&s;ter; nor can one account for his not perform|ing
the ceremony, but by his dignity of prince of the blood, which
did not &s;uffer by the mini&s;tration of an inferior prelate. Behind the
<PB N="38" REF="55">
queen of Naples is an abbe&s;s, and at a di&s;tance a view of a town, that
mu&s;t be Tichfield, from whence the queen was led to be married at
Southwick. Be&s;ides the &s;eeming pregnancy of the queen, there is
another circum&s;tance, conclu&s;ive for this picture being painted after
the death of Henry. Round his head is the nimbus or glory: an ad|dition
that was as po&s;terior to his marriage, as the painter &s;eems to in|timate
the queen's fruitfullne&s;s was anterior to it. Round the hem of
the queen's robe are &s;ome letters<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This was a fa&s;hion as early as the reign of Richard II. when Edward Earl of Rutland, the Lord Spencer and others accu&s;ed the Earl of Arundel of trea&s;on, they appeared before the king at Nottingham in red gowns of &s;ilk, garded and bordered <HI>with white &s;ilk and embroidered with letters of gold.</HI> Peck's Annals of Stanford 12, 39.

If it is objected to me, that This was meer herald's painting, I an|&s;wer,
That was almo&s;t the only painting we had. The art was en|gro&s;&s;ed
by and confined to the vanity or devotion of the nobility. The
arms they bore and quartered, their mi&s;&s;als, their church-windows and
the images of their idols were the only circum&s;tances in which they had
any employment for a painter. Even portraits, the object of modern
vanity, &s;eem not to have been in fa&s;hion. I know not one except of
the blood royal or of a bi&s;hop or two, painted during the period of
which I am writing. Devout &s;ubjects were held in &s;ufficient e&s;timation.
I&s;abel counte&s;s of Warwick in 1439, bequeathed her tablet with the
image of our lady to the church of Wal&s;ingham, and it is even men|tioned
that this tablet had a gla&s;s over it. I cannot pa&s;s over this
magnificent lady without taking a little notice of &s;ome other particu|lars
of her will. She was daughter and at length &s;ole heire&s;s of Tho|mas
le De&s;pen&s;er earl of Gloce&s;ter, widow of Richard Beauchamp earl
of Worce&s;ter, and afterwards by di&s;pen&s;ation married to his cou&s;in that
potent and warlike peer, Richard Beauchamp earl of Warwick. Their
portraits on gla&s;s with others of their lineage were long extant in the
church at Warwick. Her great templys<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jewels hanging on the foreheads of ladies by bodkins thru&s;t into their hair. See Dugdale's Warwick&s;hire, p. 413.</NOTE> with the baleys &s;old to the

with her burial there, and what el&s;e &s;he had appointed to be done a|bout
the &s;ame. To our lady of Wal&s;ingham, her gown of green alyz
cloth of gold with wide &s;leeves, and a tabernacle of &s;ilver like in the
timbre to that over our lady of Caver&s;ham, and ordered that her great
image of wax, then at London, &s;hould be offered to our lady of Wor|ce&s;ter.
<PB N="41" REF="58">
To the abbey of Tewk&s;bury &s;he gave her wedding gown, and
all her cloaths of gold and cloaths of &s;ilk without furs, &s;aving one of
ru&s;&s;et velvet which &s;he be&s;towed on St. Winifrede. But having thus
di&s;po&s;ed of her wardrobe for the u&s;e of the &s;aints, &s;he &s;eems to have
had very different thoughts about her &s;elf, ordering that &startq;a &s;tatue of
her &s;hould be made all nakyd with her hair ca&s;t backward, according
to the de&s;ign and model that one Thomas Porchalion had for that
purpo&s;e.&endq; This extreme prohibition of all covering, I &s;uppo&s;e,
flowed from &s;ome principle of humility in this good lady, who having
dive&s;ted her&s;elf of all vain ornaments in favour of our lady and St.
Winifrede, would not indulge her own per&s;on even in the covering of
the hair of her head. And it looks, by the legacy to the monks above,
as if &s;he had &s;ome apprehen&s;ions that they would not reli&s;h or compre|hend
the delicacy of &s;uch total rejection of all &s;uperfluities. I was will|ing
to mention this te&s;tament too, becau&s;e it &s;eems to record even the
name of an ancient &s;tatuary. Other &s;tatuaries and founders are men|tioned
in the co&s;t be&s;towed on the tomb of the earl her hu&s;band.
Dugdale has pre&s;erved the covenant between the executors and the
arti&s;ts. There I find John E&s;&s;ex, marbler, William Au&s;tin, founder,
Thomas Stevens, copper-&s;myth, John Bourde of Corffe ca&s;tle, marbler,
Bartholomew Lamb&s;pring a Dutch gold-&s;mith; they agree on all the
particulars for the image on the tomb, and the little images and e&s;|cutcheons
round it. The tomb with the image &s;till extant in po|li&s;hed
bra&s;s of the highe&s;t pre&s;ervation witne&s;&s;es that the arti&s;ts were ex|cellent
enough to de&s;erve this memorial. John Prudde of We&s;tmin|&s;ter,
called &s;imply, glazier, appears to have painted the windows of
the chapel; and it was particularly &s;tipulated that &startq;he &s;hould employ
<PB N="42" REF="59">
no gla&s;s of England, but with gla&s;s beyond the &s;eas, and that in the

that may be had in England, and of the fine&s;t colours of blew, yellow,
red, purpure, &s;anguine and violet, and of all other colours that &s;hall be
mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and be&s;t to make rich and embelli&s;h the matters, images

all the&s;e circum&s;tances it is plain that the executors thought that the
magnificence of the intended monument mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the value and

This covenant carries us &s;till farther, and has even brought to

<P>The wealth and &s;plendor of that family was &s;o great, that Henry
Beauchamp, &s;on of Richard and I&s;abel, was at the age of nineteen
created premier earl of England, and three days after he was made
duke of Warwick, with precedence next to the duke of Norfolk and
before the duke of Buckingham&mdash;an act of power &s;o de&s;tructive of all
the vanity of nobility and blood, that the duke of Buckingham could
not dige&s;t it: It occa&s;ioned &s;uch animo&s;ity, that the king was obliged
to qualify his grant, by e&s;tabli&s;hing between the contending parties a
rotation of &s;eniority, each to take place alternately for a year, the &s;ur|vivor
to precede for his life the heir of the other, and &s;o in perpetuum.
A &s;en&s;ele&s;s jumble, &s;oon liquidated by a more egregious act of folly,
the king with his own hand crowning the young duke of Warwick
king of the i&s;le of Wight&mdash;nor can one ea&s;ily conceive a more ridicu|lous
circum&s;tance, than a man who had lo&s;t the kingdom of France
amu&s;ing him&s;elf with be&s;towing the diadem of the little i&s;le of Wight&mdash;but
to return to our arti&s;ts&mdash;I find the name of another &s;culptor at the

the princes and prince&s;&s;es to whom they belonged, or for whom they
were de&s;igned as pre&s;ents. The dre&s;&s;es and buildings of the times are
pre&s;erved, though by frequent anachroni&s;ms applied to the ages of
&s;cripture; and the gold and colours are of the greate&s;t brightne&s;s and

prince, who was not only reckoned the be&s;t painter of his age, but who
would really appear no mean performer in the pre&s;ent: This was Ren&egrave;
of Anjou, king of the two Sicilies, duke of Lorrain and count of
Provence, much known from having lo&s;t almo&s;t all his dominions;
yet it has been little remarked that he was one of the very few princes
who did not de&s;erve to lo&s;e them, having merited from his &s;ubjects
the title of THE GOOD. His own picture painted by him&s;elf is &s;till ex|tant
in the chapel of the Carmelites at Aix, and the print from it in

<P>In this age was fini&s;hed the cloy&s;ter adjoining to the old church of
St. Paul: It was built round a chapel in Pardon-church Hawgh, a
place &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the church, where Thomas More
dean of St. Paul's in the reign of Henry V. re&s;tored an ancient chapel,
but dying before he had accompli&s;hed it, it was fini&s;hed by his execu|tors,
by licen&s;e from Henry VI. On the walls of this cloy&s;ter was
painted, at the charge of Jenkyn Carpenter, a citizen of London, the
Dance of Death, in imitation of that in the cloy&s;ter adjoining to St. In|nocent's
church-yard at Paris. Underneath were Engli&s;h ver&s;es (to
explain the paintings) tran&s;lated from the French, by John Lidgate
the famous poetic monk of Bury. Dugdale has pre&s;erved the lines,
and Holbein by borrowing the thought, ennobled the pictures.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Dugdale's St. Paul's, p. 134, and Stowe, 354.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this reign John de Whetham&s;ted abbot of St. Albans, a man of

in treating naked &s;ubjects than freedom of expre&s;&s;ion. Indeed Raphael
him&s;elf had not then &s;truck out that maje&s;tic freedom, which has &s;ince
animated painting, and delivered it from the &s;ervility of coldly copy|ing
motionle&s;s nature. Mabu&s;e &s;o far improved his ta&s;te, as to intro|duce
among his countrymen poetic hi&s;tory, for &s;o I &s;hould under&s;tand

treated hi&s;toric &s;ubjects allegorically. I never could conceive that rid|dles
and rebus's (and I look upon &s;uch emblems as little better) are
any improvements upon hi&s;tory. Allegoric per&s;onages are a poor de|compo&s;ition
of human nature, whence a &s;ingle quality is &s;eparated and
erected into a kind of half deity, and then to be rendered intelligible,
is forced to have it's name written by the accompanyment of &s;ymbols.

<P>A much admired work of Mabu&s;e was an altar-piece at Middle|burgh,
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Painted for the abbot Maximilian of Burgundy who died 1524.</NOTE> a de&s;cent from the cro&s;s: Albert Durer went on purpo&s;e to

&s;ee and prai&s;ed it. Indeed their &s;tyle was very like: A picture of Ma|bu&s;e
now at St. James's is generally called Albert's. The piece at
Middleburgh was de&s;troyed by lightning. A great number of Ma|bu&s;e's
works were pre&s;erved in the &s;ame city in the time of Carl Ver|mander.
M. Magnus at Delft had another de&s;cent from the cro&s;s by
this ma&s;ter. The<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mint-ma&s;ter of Zeland.</NOTE> Sieur Wyntgis at Am&s;terdam had a Lucretia by
him. But one of his mo&s;t &s;triking performances was the decollation of
St. John, painted in the &s;hades of a &s;ingle colour.</P>
<P>The Marquis de Veren took him into his own hou&s;e, where he drew
the Virgin and Child, borrowing the ideas of their heads from the Ma|quis's
lady and &s;on. This was reckoned his capital piece. It afterwards
pa&s;&s;ed into the cabinet of M. Fro&s;mont.</P>
<P>While he was in this &s;ervice, the Emperor Charles V. was to lodge
at the hou&s;e of that lord, who made magnificent preparations for his re|ception,
and among other expences ordered all his hou&s;hold to be
dre&s;&s;ed in white dama&s;k. Mabu&s;e, always wanting money to wa&s;te in
debauchery, when the tailor came to take his mea&s;ure, de&s;ired to have
the dama&s;k, under pretence of inventing a &s;ingular habit. He &s;old the
&s;tuff, drunk out the money, and then painted a &s;uit of paper, &s;o like
dama&s;k, that it was not di&s;tingui&s;hed, as he marched in the proce&s;&s;ion,
between a philo&s;opher and a poet, other pen&s;ioners of the Marquis,
who being informed of the trick, a&s;ked the Emperor which of the three
&s;uits he liked be&s;t: The Prince pointed to Mabu&s;e's, as excelling in the
whitene&s;s and beauty of the flowers; nor did he 'till convinced by the

Vermander had &s;een &s;everal good drawings by him in black chalk.</P>
<P>At what time Mabu&s;e came to England I do not find; Vermander
&s;ays expre&s;ly that he was here, and the portraits drawn by him are a
confirmation. The picture of Prince Arthur, Prince Henry and Prin|ce&s;s
Margaret, when children, now in the china-clo&s;et at Wind&s;or, was
done by him. A neat little copy of, or rather his original de&s;ign for it,
in black and white oil-colours is at the Duke of Leeds's at Kiveton.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is another of the&s;e in &s;mall in queen's Caroline's clo&s;et at Ken&s;ington, another, very good, at Wilton, and another in Mr. Methuen's collection. One of the&s;e pictures, I do not know which of them, was &s;old out of the royal collec|tion, during the civil war, for ten pounds. The picture that was at Kiveton is now in London, and is not entirely black and white, but the carnations are pale, and all the &s;hadows tinged with pure black: but that was the manner of painting at the time; blues, reds, greens and yellows not being blended in the gradations.</NOTE>
Sandrart &s;peaks of the pictures of two noble youths drawn by him at
Whitehall. Over one of the doors in the King's anti-chamber at St.
James's is his picture of Adam and Eve, which formerly hung in the
gallery at Whitehall, thence called the Adam and Eve gallery.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Evelyn in the preface to his idea of the perfection of painting, mentions this picture, painted, as he calls him, by Malvagius, and objects to the ab&s;urdity of re|pre&s;enting Adam and Eve with navels, and a fountain with carved imagery in Pa|radi&s;e&mdash;the latter remark is ju&s;t; the former is only worthy of a critical manmid|wi&s;e.</NOTE> Mar|tin
Papenbroech, formerly a famous collector in Holland, had another of
them. It was brought over as a picture of Raphael in his fir&s;t manner,
in the time of Vertue, who by the exact de&s;cribtion of it in Vermander
di&s;covered it to be of Mabu&s;e. It was &s;old however for a con&s;iderable

martyrologies, with the in&s;trument of his death. The queen might
have &s;ome devotion to that peculiar &s;aint, or might be born or mar|ried
on his fe&s;tival. Be that as it may, the picture, though in a hard
manner, has it's merit, independent of the curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>John Schorel &s;tudied &s;ome time under Mabu&s;e, but quitted him on
account of his irregularities, by which Schorel was once in danger of
his life. Paul Van Ael&s;t excelled in copying Mabu&s;e's works, and
John Mo&s;tart a&s;&s;i&s;ted the latter in his works at Middleburgh.</P>
<P>In the library of St. John's college Cambridge is an original of their
foundre&s;s Margaret of Richmond, the king's mother, much damaged,
and the painter not known. Mr. We&s;t has a curious mi&s;&s;al (the painter
unknown) which belonged to Margaret queen of Scotland, and was a
pre&s;ent from her father Henry VII. His name of his own writing is in
the fir&s;t page. The queen's portrait praying to St. Margaret, appears
twice in the illuminations, and beneath &s;everal of them are the arms
and matches of the hou&s;e of Somer&s;et, be&s;ides repre&s;entations of the
twelve months, well painted.</P>
<P>In this reign died John Rous, the antiquarian of Warwick&s;hire, who

<P>1509. THE acce&s;&s;ion of this &s;umptuous prince brought along with it
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the arts. He was opulent, grand and li|beral&mdash;how
many invitations to arti&s;ts! A man of ta&s;te en|courages
abilities; a man of expence, any performers; but when a
king is magnificent, whether he has ta&s;te or not, the influence is &s;o ex|ten&s;ive,
and the example &s;o catching, that even merit has a chance of
getting bread. Though Henry had no genius to &s;trike out the im|provements
of latter ages, he had parts enough to chu&s;e the be&s;t of
what the then world exhibited to his option. He was galant as
far as the ru&s;ticity of his country and the boi&s;terous indelicacy of his
own complexion would admit. His tournaments contracted, in imi|tation
of the French, a kind of romantic politene&s;s. In one<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See a de&s;cription and exhibition of this tournament among the prints pub|li&s;hed by the Society of Antiquaries, vol. i.</NOTE> which he
held on the birth of his fir&s;t child, he &s;tyled him&s;elf <HI>Coeur Loyal.</HI> In
his interview with Francis I. in the vale of Cloth of Gold, he revived
<PB N="57" REF="76">
the pageantry of the days of Amadis. He and his favorite Charles
Brandon were the prototypes of tho&s;e illu&s;trious heroes, with which
Mademoi&s;elle Scuderi has enriched the world of chivalry. The Favo|rite's
motto on his marriage with the monarch's &s;i&s;ter retained that mo|ral

<P>Francis the fir&s;t was the &s;tandard which the&s;e princely champions co|pied.
While he contended with Charles V. for empire, he rivalled our
Henry in pomp and protection of the arts. Francis handelled the pen|cil
him&s;elf; I do not find that Henry pu&s;hed his imitation &s;o far; but
though at la&s;t He wofully unravelled mo&s;t of the pur&s;uits of his early
age, (for at lea&s;t it was great violation of galantry to cut off the heads
of the fair dam&s;els who&s;e true knight he had been, and there is no for|giving
him that de&s;truction of ancient monuments and gothic piles and
painted gla&s;s by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries; a reformation, as he
called it, which we antiquarians almo&s;t devoutly lament) yet he had
countenanced the arts &s;o long, and they acquired &s;uch &s;olid foundation
here, that they were &s;carce eradicated by that &s;econd &s;torm which broke
upon them during the civil war,&mdash;an aera we antiquarians lament
with no le&s;s devotion than the former.</P>
<P>Henry had &s;everal painters in his &s;ervice, and, as Francis invited
Primaticcio and other ma&s;ters from Italy, he endeavoured to tempt
hither Raphael<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Raphael did paint a St. George for him, which has &s;ince been in Mon&s;r. Cro|zat's collection. See Recueil des plus beaux tableaux qui &s;ont on France, p. 13.</NOTE> and Titian. Some performers he did get from that

that could be recoverd in relation to him has been &s;edu|lou&s;ly
pre&s;erved; and, as always happens to a real genius, he has been
complimented with a thou&s;and wretched performances that were un|worthy
of him. The year of his birth, the place of his birth have been
conte&s;ted; yet it is certain that the former happened in 1498, and the
latter mo&s;t probably was Ba&s;il. His father was a painter of Au&s;burg,
and &s;o much e&s;teemed, that the Lord of Walberg paid an hundred flo|rins
to the mona&s;tery of St. Catherine for a large picture of the &s;aluta|tion
painted by him. He executed too in half figures the life of St.
Paul, on which he wrote this in&s;cription, &startq;This work was compleated
by J. Holbein, a citizen of Au&s;burg, 1499.&endq; John Holbein, the elder,
had a brother called Sigi&s;mond, a painter too. Hans, &s;o early as 1512,
drew the pictures of both, which came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sandrart,
who has engraved them in his book, and which, if not extremely im|proved
by the engraver, are indeed admirable performances for a boy
of fourteen.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that in the regi&s;ter's office of Wells there is mention of a
Holbein who died here in the reign of Henry VII. Had it been the
father, it would probably have been mentioned by &s;ome of the biogra|phers
of the &s;on; but I find it no where hinted that the father was ever
in England. It is more likely to have been the uncle, who we have
&s;een was a painter, and do not find that he was a very good one. He
might have come over, and died here in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Holbein's inclination to drawing appeared very early, and could not
fail of being encouraged in a family<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Holbein had two brothers, Ambro&s;e and Bruno, who were al&s;o painters at Ba&s;il.</NOTE> &s;o addicted to the art. His father
<PB N="66" REF="88">
him&s;elf in&s;tructed him; and he learned be&s;ides, graving, ca&s;ting, mo|delling
and architecture: in the two latter branches he was excellent.
Yet with both talents and ta&s;te, he for &s;ome time remained in indigence,
di&s;&s;ipating with women what he acquired by the former, and drowning
in wine the delicacy of the latter. At that time Era&s;mus was retired to
Ba&s;il, a man, who&s;e luck of fame was derived from all the circum&s;tan|ces
which he him&s;elf reckoned unfortunate. He lived when learning
was ju&s;t emerging out of barbari&s;m, and &s;hone by lamenting elegantly
the defects of his cotemporaries. His being one of the fir&s;t to attack
&s;uper&s;titions which he had not courage to relinqui&s;h, gave him merit
in the eyes of prote&s;tants, while his time-&s;erving had an air of modera|tion;
and his very poverty, that threw him into &s;ervile adulation, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
it&s;elf in terms that were beautifull enough to be tran&s;mitted to
po&s;terity. His cupboard of plate, all pre&s;ented to him by the greate&s;t
men of the age, was at once a monument of his flattery and genius.
With a mind &s;o poli&s;hed no wonder he di&s;tingui&s;hed the talents of
young Holbein. He was warmly recommended to employment by
Era&s;mus and Amerbach,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See an account of him in Palmer's hi&s;tory of printing, p. 218.</NOTE> a printer of that city. He painted the pic|ture
of the latter in 1519, who &s;howing him the Moriae Encomium of
the former, Holbein drew on the margin many of the characters de&s;cri|bed
in the book. Era&s;mus was &s;o plea&s;ed with tho&s;e &s;ketches that he
kept the book ten days&mdash;the &s;ub&s;equent incidents were trifling indeed,
and not much to the honour of the politene&s;s of either. Holbein, rude|ly
enough, wrote under the figure of an old &s;tudent, the name of Era&s;|mus.
The author, with very little &s;pirit of repartee, wrote under a
fellow drinking, the name of Holbein. The&s;e are anecdotes certainly
<PB N="67" REF="89">
not worth repeating for their importance, but very de&s;criptive of the
e&s;teem in which two men were held of whom &s;uch anecdotes could be
thought worth pre&s;erving.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the Moriae Encomium publi&s;hed at Ba&s;il by M. Patin, 1656, with cuts from Holbein's de&s;igns, there is a large account of him collected by Patin, and a catalogue of his works. On tho&s;e drawings were written the following lines;
<L>Rex Macedon Coo tumidus pictore, cani &s;e</L>
<L>Maeoniae doluit non potui&s;&s;e &s;ene.</L>
<L>Stultitiae potior &s;ors e&s;t; hanc alter Apelles</L>

<L>Seb. Fe&s;chius Ba&s;il.</L></NOTE></P>
<P>Supported by the protection of the&s;e friends, Holbein grew into
great reputation. The earl of Arundel<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Others &s;ay it was the earl of Surrey who was travelling into Italy; and that Holbein not recollecting his name, drew his picture by memory, and Sir Thomas More immediately knew it to be that lord.</NOTE> returning from Italy through
Ba&s;il, &s;aw his works, was charmed with them, and advi&s;ed him to go
into England. At fir&s;t Holbein neglected this advice; but in 1526
his family and the froward temper of his wife increa&s;ing, and his bu|&s;ine&s;s
declining, he determined upon that journey.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he &s;aid he &s;hould quit Ba&s;il but for a time, and only to rai&s;e
the value of his works, which were growing too numerous there; yet
before he went, he intimated that he &s;hould leave a &s;pecimen of the
power of his abilities. He had &s;till at his hou&s;e a portrait that he had ju&s;t
fini&s;hed for one of his patrons&mdash;on the forehead he painted a fly, and
&s;ent the picture to the per&s;on for whom it was de&s;igned. The gentle|man
&s;truck with the beauty of the piece, went eagerly to bru&s;h off the
fly&mdash;and found the deceit. The &s;tory &s;oon &s;pread, and as &s;uch trifling
<PB N="68" REF="90">
deceptions often do, made more impre&s;&s;ion than greater excellencies&punc;
Orders were immediately given to prevent the city being deprived of &s;o
wonderfull an arti&s;t&mdash;but Holbein had withdrawn him&s;elf privately.
Era&s;mus had given him recommendatory letters to Sir Thomas More,
with a pre&s;ent of his own picture by Holbein, which he a&s;&s;ured the
Chancellor was more like than one drawn by Albert Durer.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">At lord Folk&s;ton's at Longford in Wilt&s;hire, are the portraits of Era&s;mus and Aegidius, &s;aid to be drawn by Holbein; they belonged to Dr. Meade, and while in his collection had the following lines written on the frames, and &s;till re|maining there: On that of Era&s;mus,
<Q><L>E tenebris clarum doctrinae attollere lumen</L>
<L>Qui felix potuit, primus Era&s;mus erat.</L>
<L>On Aegidius.</L>
<L>Aegidium mu&s;is charum dilexit Era&s;mus;</L>
<L>Spirat ab Holbenio pictus uterque tuo.</L></Q>
The latter is far the better; that of Era&s;mus, is &s;tiff and flat. However this is believed to be the very picture which Era&s;mus &s;ent by Holbein him&s;elf to Sir Tho|mas More, and which was afterwards in the cabinet of Andrew de Loo and from thence pa&s;&s;ed into the Arundelian collection. But I &s;hould rather think it is the picture which was in king Charles's (&s;ee his catal. No. 13, p. 154.) where it is &s;aid to have been painted by George Spence of Nuremberg. Quintin Mat&s;is too painted Aegidius, with which Sir Thomas More was &s;o plea&s;ed, that he wrote a panegyrie on the painter, beginning,
<Q><L>Quintine, o veteris novator artis,</L>
<L>Magno non minor artifex Apelle.</L></Q>
Aegidius held a letter in his hand from Sir Thomas, with his hand-writing &s;o well imitated, that More could not di&s;tingui&s;h it him&s;elf. Quintin too in the year 1521 drew the picture of the celebrated phy&s;ician Dr. Linacre.</NOTE> Holbein
&s;topped for a &s;hort time at Antwerp, having other letters for P. Aegi|dius,
<PB N="69" REF="91">
a common friend of Era&s;mus and More. In tho&s;e letters the for|mer
tells Aegidius, that Holbein was very de&s;irous of &s;eeing the works
of Quintin Mat&s;is, the celebrated black-&s;mith painter, who&s;e tools, it is
&s;aid, Love converted into a pencil. Of this ma&s;ter Holbein had no
rea&s;on to be jealous: With great truth and greater labour, Quintin's
pictures are inferior to Holbein's. The latter &s;moothed the &s;tiffne&s;s of
his manner by a velvet &s;oftne&s;s and lu&s;tre of colouring; the perfor|mances
of his cotemporary want that perfecting touch; nor are there
any evidences that Quintin could a&s;cend above the coar&s;ene&s;s or defor|mities
of nature. Holbein was equal to dignified character&mdash;He could
expre&s;s the piercing genius of More, or the grace of Ann Boleyn. Em|ployed
by More, Holbein was employed as he ought to be: This was
the happy moment of his pencil; from painting the author, he ro&s;e to
the philo&s;opher, and then &s;unk to work for the king. I do not know
a &s;ingle countenance into which any ma&s;ter has poured greater energy
of expre&s;&s;ion than in the drawing of Sir Thomas More at Ken&s;ington:
It has a freedom, a boldne&s;s of thought and acutene&s;s of penetration
that atte&s;t the &s;incerity of the re&s;emblance. It is Sir Thomas More in
the rigour of his &s;en&s;e, not in the &s;weetne&s;s of his plea&s;antry&mdash;Here he
is the unblemi&s;hed magi&s;trate, not that amiable philo&s;opher, who&s;e hu|mility
neither power nor piety could elate, and who&s;e mirth even mar|tyrdom
could not &s;poil. Here he is rather that &s;ingle cruel judge whom
one knows not how to hate, and who in the vigour of abilities, of know|ledge
and good humour per&s;ecuted others in defence of &s;uper&s;titions
that he him&s;elf had expo&s;ed; and who capable of di&s;daining life at the
price of his &s;incerity, yet thought that God was to be &s;erved by promo|ting
<PB N="70" REF="92">
an impo&s;ture; who triumphed over Henry and Death, and &s;unk
to be an accomplice, at lea&s;t the dupe, of the holy maid of Kent!</P>
<P>Holbein was kindly received by More and was taken into his hou&s;e
at Chel&s;ea. There he worked for near three years, drawing the por|traits
of Sir Thomas, his relations and friends. The king vi&s;iting the
chancellor, &s;aw &s;ome of tho&s;e pictures, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction.
Sir Thomas begged him to accept which ever he liked&mdash;but he enqui|red
for the painter, who was introduced to him. Henry immediately
took him into his own &s;ervice, and told the chancellor, that now he
had got the arti&s;t, he did not want the pictures. An apartment in the
palace was immediately allotted to Holbein, with a &s;alary of 200 florins,
be&s;ides his being paid for his pictures: The price of them I no where
find.</P>
<P>Patin &s;ays that after three years Holbein returned to Ba&s;il to di&s;play
his good fortune, but &s;oon returned to England. It is not probable that
he lived &s;o long with Sir Thomas More as is a&s;&s;erted. He drew the
king &s;everal times, and I &s;uppo&s;e all his queens, though no portrait
of Catherine Parr is known of his hand. He painted too the king's
children, and the chief per&s;ons of the court, as will be mentioned here|after.
The writers of his life relate a &s;tory, which Vermander, his fir&s;t
biographer, affirms came from Dr. I&s;ely of Ba&s;il and from Amerbach:
yet, in another place, Vermander complaining of the latter, to whom
he &s;ays he applied for anecdotes relating to Holbein and his works;
after eight or ten years could get no other an&s;wer, than that it would
co&s;t a great deal of trouble to &s;eek after tho&s;e things, and that he &s;hould
expect to be well paid. The &s;tory is, that one day as Holbein was pri|vately
drawing &s;ome lady's picture for the king, a great lord forced
<PB N="71" REF="93">
him&s;elf into the chamber. Holbein threw him down &s;tairs; the peer
cried out; Holbein bolted him&s;elf in, e&s;caped over the top of the hou&s;e,
and running directly to the king, fell on his knees, and be&s;ought his
maje&s;ty to pardon him, without declaring the offence. The king pro|mi&s;ed
to forgive him if he would tell the truth; but &s;oon began to re|pent,
&s;aying he &s;hould not ea&s;ily overlook &s;uch in&s;ults, and bad him
wait in the apartment 'till he had learned more of the matter. Imme|diately
arrived the lord with his complaint, but &s;inking the provoca|tion.
At fir&s;t the monarch heard the &s;tory with temper, but broke out,
reproaching the nobleman with his want of truth, and adding, &startq;You
have not to do with Holbein, but with me; I tell you, of &s;even pea|&s;ants
I can make as many lords, but not one Holbein&mdash;begone, and
remember, that if you ever pretend to revenge your&s;elf, I &s;hall look
on any injury offered to the painter as done to my&s;elf.&endq; Henry's be|haviour
is certainly the mo&s;t probable part of the &s;tory.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lovelace, in his collection of poems called Luca&s;ta, has an epigram on this &s;ubject, but it is not worth repeating.</NOTE></P>
<P>After the death of Jane Seymour, Holbein was &s;ent to Flanders to

Among the Harleian MSS. there is a letter from Sir Thomas Wyat to
the king, congratulating his maje&s;ty on his e&s;cape, as the duche&s;s's
cha&s;tity was a little equivocal. If it was, con&s;idering Henry's temper,
I am apt to think that the duche&s;s had the greater e&s;cape. It was

<P>Little more occurs memorable of this great painter, but that in
1538, the city of Ba&s;il, on the increa&s;e of his fame, be&s;towed an annuity
of fifty florins on him for two years, hoping, &s;ays my author, that it
would induce him to return to his country, to his wife and his children.
How large &s;o ever that &s;alary might &s;eem in the eyes of frugal Swi&s;s
citizens, it is plain it did not weigh with Holbein again&s;t the opulence
of the court of England. He remained here 'till his death, which was
occa&s;ioned by the plague in the year 1554, in the fifty-&s;ixth year of his
age. Some accounts make him die in the &s;pot where is now the paper-office;

but that is not likely, as that very place had been king Henry's
private &s;tudy, and was then appointed for the reception of the letters

thought, if he died in the precincts of the palace, that it was in &s;ome
&s;light lodgings there, then called the paper-buildings, or in Scotland|yard
where the king's artificers lived; but he was rather of opinion
that Holbein breathed his la&s;t in the duke of Norfolk's hou&s;e in the

the celebrated collector in the reign of Charles I. was de&s;irous of
erecting a monument for him, but dropped the de&s;ign from ignorance
of the place. Strype in his edition of Stowe's Survey &s;ays that he was

<P>Holbein painted in oil, in di&s;temper and water-colours. He had
never practiced the la&s;t 'till he came to England, where he learned it of

He generally painted on a green ground; in his &s;mall pictures often on
a deep blue. There is a tradition that he painted with his left hand,

his own portraits that was in the Arundelian collection and came to
$ord Stafford, in which he holds his pencil in the right hand.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to give a compleat catalogue of his works; they were

to &s;trangers through a grate. And yet, as Vertue ob&s;erved, our
painter had undoubtedly no hand in it. Pope Eugenius IV. appointed
the council of Ba&s;il 1431, and it &s;at there 15 years, during which
time a plague raged that carried off all degrees of people. On the ce&s;|&s;ation
of it, the work in que&s;tion was immediately painted as a memo|rial
of that calamity. Holbein could not be the original painter, for
he was not born 'till 1498; nor had any hand in the part that was add|ed
in 1529, at which time he had left Ba&s;il. Even if he had been there
when it was done (which was about the time of his &s;hort return thither)
it is not probable that mention of him would have been omitted in the
in&s;cription which the magi&s;trates cau&s;ed to be placed under tho&s;e paint|ings,
e&s;pecially when the name of one Hugo Klauber, a painter who
repaired them in 1569, is carefully recorded. But there is a &s;tronger
proof of their not being the work of Holbein, and at the &s;ame time an
evidence of his ta&s;te. The paintings at Ba&s;il are a dull &s;eries of figures,
of a pope, emperor, king, queen, &amp;c. each &s;eized by a figure of Death;
but in the prints which Hollar has given of Holbein's drawings of
Death's Dance, a de&s;ign he borrowed from the work at Ba&s;il, there
are groupes of figures, and a richne&s;s of fancy and invention peculiar
to him&s;elf. Every &s;ubject is varied, and adorned with buildings and

one at Petworth, and another in the gallery at Wind&s;or. But there is
one head of that king at Ken&s;ington, not only genuine, but perhaps
the mo&s;t perfect of his works. It hangs by the chimney in the &s;econd
room, leading to the great drawing-room; and would alone account
for the judgment of Depiles, who in his &s;cale of picture&s;que merit,
allows 16 degrees to Holbein, when he had alloted but 12 to Raphael.
I conclude that it was in the &s;ame light that Frederic Zucchero con&s;i|dered

him to Raphael. Both Zucchero and Depiles under&s;tood the

of colouring, between the greate&s;t genius, in his way, that has ap|peared,

branch of his art. The texture of a ro&s;e is more delicate than that of
an oak; I do not &s;ay that it grows &s;o lofty or ca&s;ts &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;hade.</P>

It is great pity that they have not been engraved, not only that &s;uch

10 <HI>l.</HI>&mdash;18 <HI>s.</HI>&mdash;6 <HI>d.</HI>&endq; Patch and Archee were political characters: The
former, who had been Wol&s;ey's fool, and who like wi&s;er men, had
lived in favour through all the changes of religion and folly with which
four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive courts had amu&s;ed them&s;elves or tormented every body
el&s;e, was employed by Sir Francis Knollys to break down the crucifix,
which queen Elizabeth &s;till retained in her chapel; and the latter, I
&s;uppo&s;e on &s;ome &s;uch in&s;tigation, demoli&s;hed that which Laud erected
at St. James's, and which was probably the true cau&s;e of that prelate
engaging the king and council in his quarrel, though abu&s;ive words
were the pretence. Of little Jeffery I &s;hall &s;ay more in another place.</P>
<P>King James II. as appears by the catalogue of his pictures publi&s;hed
by Bathoe, had &s;everal of Holbein; though all in that li&s;t were not
painted by him.</P>
<P>Of Holbein's public works in England I find an account of only
four. The fir&s;t is that capital picture in &s;urgeon's hall, of Henry VIII.
giving the charter to the company of &s;urgeons. The character of his
maje&s;ty's bluff haughtine&s;s is well repre&s;ented, and all the heads are
finely executed. The picture it&s;elf has been retouched, but is well
known by Baron's print. The phy&s;ician in the middle on the king's
left hand is Dr. Butts, immortalized by Shake&s;pear.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The ring which Henry &s;ent by Dr. Butts to Cardinal Wol&s;ey, was a cameo on a ruby of the king him&s;elf, formerly given to him by the Cardinal.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;econd is the large piece in the hall of Bridewell, repre&s;enting
Edward VI. delivering to the lord mayor of London the royal charter,
by which he gave up and erected his palace of Bridewell into an ho&s;|pital
and workhou&s;e. Holbein has placed his own head in one corner of
the picture. Vertue has engraved it. This picture, it is believed, was
<PB N="87" REF="109">
not compleated by Holbein, both he and the king dying immediately
after the donation.</P>
<P>The third and fourth were two large pictures, painted in di&s;temper,
in the hall of the Ea&s;terling merchants in the Steelyard, Where De&s;|camps
found, I do not know, that they were de&s;igned for ceilings.
It is probably a mi&s;take. The&s;e pictures exhibited the triumphs of
riches and poverty. The former was repre&s;ented by Plutus riding in a
golden carr; before him &s;at Fortune &s;cattering money, the chariot
being loaded with coin, and drawn by four white hor&s;es, but blind,
and led by women, who&s;e names were written beneath. Round the carr
were crowds with extended hands catching at the favours of the god.
Fame and Fortune attended him, and the proce&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed by
Croe&s;us, Midas, and other avaritious per&s;ons of note.</P>
<P>Poverty was an old woman, &s;itting in a vehicle as &s;hattered as the
other was &s;uperb; her garments &s;qualid, and every emblem of wretch|edne&s;s
around her. She was drawn by a&s;&s;es and oxen, which were
guided by Hope, and Diligence, and other emblematic figures, and at|tended
by mechanics and labourers, The richne&s;s of the colouring,
the plumpne&s;s of the fle&s;h, the gaudy ornaments in the former; and
the &s;trong touches and expre&s;&s;ion in the latter were univer&s;ally admi|red.
It was on the &s;ight of the&s;e pictures that Zucchero expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch
e&s;teem of this ma&s;ter: he copied them in Indian ink, and tho&s;e draw|ings
came afterwards into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mon&s;. Crozat. Vo&s;terman
jun. engraved prints from them, at lea&s;t of the triumph of Poverty,
but Vertue could never meet with that of Riches: however in Buck|ingham-hou&s;e
in St. James's park, he found two &s;uch drawings, on
one of which was an in&s;cription attributing them to Holbein, and add|ing,
<PB N="88" REF="110">
that they were the gift of Sir Thomas More, who wrote ver&s;es
under them. Vertue thought that the&s;e drawings were neither of
Holbein nor Zucchero, but the copies which Vo&s;terman had made,
in order to engrave. The&s;e drawings I &s;uppo&s;e were &s;old in the
duche&s;s's auction.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">So I concluded, but have &s;ince been &s;o lucky to find that they were pre|&s;erved at Buckingham hou&s;e, till it was purcha&s;ed by his maje&s;ly, when the pic|tures being expo&s;ed to auction, the&s;e very drawings were exhibited there, as alle|goric pieces by Vandyck. They more than come up to any advantageous idea I had formed of Holbein. The compo&s;ition of each is noble, free, and ma&s;terly. The expre&s;&s;ions admirable, the attitudes gracefull, and &s;everal of them bearing great re&s;emblance to the &s;tyle of Raphael. The Triumph of Riches is much wider than the other. The figures in black and white chalk, the &s;kies coloured. On each are Latin ver&s;es, but no mention of Holbein, as Vertue relates. The figure of Croe&s;us has great re&s;emblance to the younger portraits of Henry VIII. By the ma&s;terly execution of the&s;e drawings, I &s;hould conclude them Zucchero's copies; but the hor&s;es, which are remarkably fine and &s;pirited, and other touches, are &s;o like the manner of Vandyck, that one is apt to attribute them to Vo&s;ter|man who lived in his time. Probably the Triumph of Riches is Vo&s;terman's copy and that of Poverty, Zucchero's. They are now at Strawberry-hill.</NOTE> For the large pictures them&s;elves Felibien and
Depiles &s;ay that they were carried into France from Flanders, whither
they were tran&s;ported I &s;uppo&s;e after the de&s;truction of the company,
of which Stowe<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Survey of London p. 249.</NOTE> gives the following account. The Steelyard was a
place for merchants of Almaine who u&s;ed to bring hither wheat, rye,
and other grain; cables, ropes, ma&s;ts, &s;teel and other profitable mer|chandize.
Henry III. at the reque&s;t of his brother Richard earl of
Cornwall and king of Almaine gave them great privileges, they then
having a hou&s;e called, Guilda Aula Teutonicorum. Edward I. con|firmed
<PB N="89" REF="111">
their charter; and in the &s;ame reign there was a great quarrel
between the mayor of London and tho&s;e merchants of the Haunce,
about the reparation of Bi&s;hop-gate, which was impo&s;ed on them in
con&s;ideration of their privileges, and which they &s;uffered to run to ruin.
Being condemned to the repairs, they were in recompence indulged
with granaries, and an alderman of their own; but in time were com|plained
of, for importing too great quantities of foreign grain. They
were re&s;tricted, yet &s;till increa&s;ed in wealth, and had a noble hall in
Thames-&s;treet with three arched gates, and in the reign of Edward III.
they hired another hou&s;e of Richard Lions, a famous lapidary, one of
the &s;heriffs, who was beheaded by the Kenti&s;h rebels in the reign of
Richard II, and another for which they paid 70<HI>l.</HI> per ann. But &s;till
continuing to engro&s;s the trade, they were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in the reign of
Edward VI. who &s;eized the liberties of the Steelyard into his own
hands.</P>
<P>But for nothing has Holbein's name been oftener mentioned than
for the picture of Sir Thomas More's family, Yet of &s;ix pieces ex|tant
on this &s;ubject, the two &s;maller are certainly copies, the three
larger probably not painted by Holbein, and the &s;ixth, tho' an original
picture, mo&s;t likely not of Sir Thomas and his family. That Hol|bein
was to draw &s;uch a piece is indubitable; a letter of Era&s;mus is
extant, thanking Sir Thomas for &s;ending him the &s;ketch of it; but there
is great pre&s;umption, that though Holbein made the de&s;ign, it was
not he who executed the picture in large, as will appear by the follow|ing
accounts of the &s;everal pieces. The mo&s;t known is that at Burford,
the &s;eat of the famous Speaker Lenthall. To &s;ay that a performance
is not equal to the reputation of it's &s;uppo&s;ed author, is not always an
<PB N="90" REF="112">
argument &s;ufficient to de&s;troy it's authenticity. It is a well-known &s;ay|ing
of Sir Godfrey Kneller, when he was reproached with any of his
ha&s;ty &s;lovenly daubings, &startq;Pho, it will not be thought mine; nobody
will believe that the &s;ame man painted this and the Chine&s;e at Wind|&s;or.&endq;</P>
<P>But there is a &s;peaking evidence on the picture it&s;elf again&s;t it's own
preten&s;ions. Holbein died in 1554. The picture at Burford is dated
1593. It is larger and there are more figures than in it's rival, the
piece in York&s;hire, and &s;ome of the&s;e Vertue thought were painted
from the life. This was kept at Gubbins in Hertford&s;hire, the &s;eat of
the Mores; but by what means the piece pa&s;&s;ed into the hands of
Lenthall, is uncertain; the remains of the family of More are &s;eated
at Barnborough in York&s;hire, where they have a &s;mall picture of their
ance&s;tor and his relations like that at Burford, but undoubtedly not an
original. There too they pre&s;erve &s;ome relicks which belonged to that
great man; as a George enamelled, and within it a miniature of Sir
Thomas; a gold cro&s;s with pearl drops, and the cap he wore at his
execution.</P>
<P>The &s;econd picture is at Heron in E&s;&s;ex, the &s;eat of Sir John Tyrrel,
but having been repainted, it is impo&s;&s;ible to judge of it's antiquity.
The di&s;pute of originality has lain only between the piece at Burford,
and the next.</P>
<P>The third large picture, and which Vertue thought the very one
painted for Sir Thomas him&s;elf, is twelve feet wide, and is the actual
piece which was in Deloo's collection, after who&s;e death it was bought
by Mr. Roper, Sir Thomas's grand&s;on. As Deloo was a collector of
Holbein's works, and his contemporary, it &s;ounds extraordinary, that a
<PB N="91" REF="113">
picture, which he thought genuine, &s;hould be doubted now; and yet
Vertue gives &s;uch &s;trong rea&s;on, &s;upported by &s;o plau&s;ible an hypothe|&s;is,
to account for its not being Holbein's, that I think them worth lay|ing
before the reader. He &s;ays the picture is but indifferent; on this
I lay no more &s;tre&s;s than I do in the ca&s;e of that at Burford; but his
ob&s;ervation that the lights and &s;hades in different parts of the picture
come from oppo&s;ite &s;ides, is unan&s;werable, and demon&s;trate it no ge|nuine
picture of Holbein, unle&s;s that ma&s;ter had been a mo&s;t ignorant
dauber, as he might &s;ometimes be a carele&s;s painter. This ab&s;urdity
Vertue accounts for, by &s;uppo&s;ing, that Holbein quitted the chancel|lor's
&s;ervice for the king's, before he had drawn out the great picture,
which however Sir Thomas always under&s;tood was to be executed;
that Holbein's bu&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ing upon him, &s;ome other painter was
employed to begin the picture, and to which Holbein was to give the
la&s;t touches; in &s;hort that inimitable perfection of fle&s;h which charac|terizes
his works. And this is the more probable as Vertue ob&s;erved
that the faces and hands are left flat and unfini&s;hed, but the ornaments,
jewels, &amp;c. are extremely laboured. As the portraits of the family,
in &s;eperate pieces, were already drawn by Holbein, the injudicious
journeyman &s;tuck them in as he found them, and never varied the
lights, which were di&s;po&s;ed, as it was indifferent in &s;ingle heads, &s;ome
from the right, &s;ome from the left, but which make a ridiculous con|tradiction
when tran&s;ported into one piece. This picture, purcha&s;ed
as I have &s;aid by Mr. Roper, the &s;on of that amiable Margaret, who&s;e
behaviour when Sir Thomas returned to the tower was a &s;ubject not
for Holbein, but for Pou&s;&s;in or Shake&s;pear! This picture remained
'till of late years at Wellhall in Eltham, Kent, the man&s;ion of the Ro|pers.
<PB N="92" REF="114">
That hou&s;e being pulled down, it hung for &s;ome time in the
king's hou&s;e at Greenwich, &s;oon after which, by the death of the la&s;t
Roper, who&s;e &s;ole daughter married Mr. Hen&s;haw, and left three
daughters, the family-picture then valued at 300<HI>l.</HI> came between them,
and Sir Rowland Wynne, who married one of them, bought the
&s;hares of the other two, and carried the picture into York&s;hire where
it now remains.</P>
<P>The other &s;mall one is in the collection of colonel Sothby in Bloom&s;|bury-&s;quare.
It is painted in the neate&s;t manner in miniature. On
the right hand are in&s;erted the portraits of Mr. More and his wife,
Sir Thomas's grand&s;on, for whom it was drawn, and their two &s;ons,
with their garden at Chel&s;ea behind, and a view of London. The
painter of this exqui&s;ite little piece is unknown.</P>
<P>The fifth was in the palace of the Delfino family at Venice, where it
was long on &s;ale, the price fir&s;t &s;et 1500<HI>l.</HI> When I &s;aw it there in 1741,
they had &s;unk it to 400<HI>l.</HI> &s;oon after which the pre&s;ent king of Polend
bought it.</P>
<P>It was evidently de&s;igned for a &s;mall altar-piece to a chapel; in the
middle on a throne &s;its the Virgin and child; on one &s;ide kneels an
elderly gentleman with two &s;ons, one of them a naked infant; oppo&s;ite
kneeling are his wife and daughters. The old man is not only unlike
all repre&s;entations of Sir Thomas More, but it is certain that he never
had but one &s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is recorded a bon-mot of Sir Thomas on the birth of his &s;on: He had three daughters: His wife was impatient for a &s;on; at la&s;t they had one, but not much above an idiot&mdash;&startq;You have prayed &s;o long for a boy, &s;aid the chancellor, that now we have got one who, I believe, will be a boy as long as he lives.&endq;</NOTE>&mdash;For the colouring it is beautifull beyond de&s;crip|tion,
<PB N="93" REF="115">
and the carnations have that enamelled bloom &s;o peculiar to
Holbein, who touched his works 'till not a touch remained di&s;cerni|ble!
A drawing of this picture by Bi&s;chop was brought over in 1723,
from whence Vertue doubted both of the &s;ubject and the painter; but
he never &s;aw the original! By the de&s;cription of the family-picture of
the con&s;ul Mejer, mentioned above, I have no doubt but this is the
very picture&mdash;Mejer and More are names not &s;o unlike, but that in
proce&s;s of time they may have been confounded, and that of More re|tained,
as much better known.</P>

<P>There is a very curious picture in the collection of col. Sothby, &s;aid

retouched by Holbein, as it was probably painted for his patron the
duke of Norfolk, from whom it de&s;cended immediately to the earl
of Arundel, out of who&s;e collection the father of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or
purcha&s;ed it. It repre&s;ents three royal pair dancing in a meadow, with
a magnificent building at a di&s;tance; they are Henry VIII. and Anne
Boleyn; and his &s;i&s;ters Margaret queen of Scots and Mary queen of
France with their &s;econd hu&s;bands, Archibald Douglas and Charles
Brandon.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This was Vertue's opinion. The account in the family calls the man in the middle the duke of Norfolk, and him on the right hand the duke of Suffolk If the tradition that this picture repre&s;ents only Engli&s;h per&s;onages were not &s;o well grounded, I &s;hould take it for a French compo&s;ition. The per&s;on in the middle is a black &s;warthy man with a &s;harp beard, like Francis I. and re&s;embling neither of the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the former of whom is never drawn with a beard, the latter always with a &s;hort &s;quare one: add to this, that the figure called Henry VIII. and which certainly has much of his countenance, is in an ob&s;cure corner of the picture, and exhibits little more than the face.</NOTE> The circum&s;tances of three matches &s;o unequal a&s;&s;embled

related to Anne Boleyn, was certainly not partial to her, as protectre&s;s
of the reformed. If this conj$cture could be verified, it would lead
one to farther reflections. The jealou&s;y which Henry towards the
end of his reign conceived again&s;t the Howards, and his &s;acrificing
the galant earl of Surrey for quartering the arms of England, as he
undoubtedly had a right to quarter them, have always appeared acts
of mo&s;t tyrannic &s;u&s;picion. He &s;o little vouch&s;afed to &s;atisfy the pub|lic
on the grounds of his proceedings, that it is po&s;&s;ible he might &s;ome|times
act on better foundation than any body knew. If he really di&s;|covered
any ambitious views in the hou&s;e of Norfolk, this picture
would &s;eem a confirmation of them. To expo&s;e the blemi&s;hes in the
blood of the three only branches of the royal family, might be a lead|ing
&s;tep towards a&s;&s;erting their own claim&mdash;at lea&s;t their own line

and Douglas.</P>
<P>Holbein's talents were not confined to his pictures; he was an ar|chitect,

<P>His cuts to the bible were engraved and printed at Leyden by Jo|hannes
Frellonius, in 1547, under this title, Icones Hi&s;toriarum vete|ris

that was a mi&s;take, for Hollar engraved them, and there is only Chri&s;t

<P>On the death of Sir Thomas Wyat the poet in 1541, a little book

<P>Of his architecture nothing now remains &s;tanding but the beautifull
porch at the earl of Pembroke's at Wilton. From that and his draw|ings
<PB N="99" REF="121">
it is evident that he had great natural ta&s;te. One cannot but la|ment
that a noble monument of his genius has lately been demoli&s;hed,
the gateway at Whitehall, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been erected for the entry
of Charles V. but that was a mi&s;take; the emperor was here in 1521;
Holbein did not arrive at &s;oone&s;t 'till five years after. Peacham men|tions
a de&s;ign that he &s;aw for a chimney-piece for Henry's new palace
at Bridewell. There undoubtedly, at Whitehall, and at Non&s;uch
were many of his productions.</P>
<P>It may be wondered that I have &s;aid nothing of a work much re|nowned
and a&s;cribed to this ma&s;ter; I mean the chamber at the lord
Montacute's at Coudray; but it is mo&s;t certainly not executed by him.
Though the hi&s;tories repre&s;ented there, the habits and cu&s;toms of the
times, make that room a &s;ingular curio&s;ity, they are it's only merit.
There is nothing good either in th de&s;igns, di&s;po&s;ition or colouring.</P>
<P>There are three other hi&s;toric pieces in the &s;ame hou&s;e, of much
more merit, a&s;cribed likewi&s;e to Holbein, and undoubtedly of his time.
The fir&s;t repre&s;ents Francis I. on his throne, with his courtiers, and
the duke of Suffo (&s;o it is written) and the earl of Southampton &s;tand|ing
before him on an emba&s;&s;y. This is by much the wor&s;t of the three,
and has been repainted. The next is &s;maller, and exhibits two knights
running a tilt on the foreground; one wears the crown of France,
another a coronet, like that of an Engli&s;h prince, compo&s;ed of cro&s;&s;es
and fleurs de lys, and not clo&s;ed at top. An elderly man with a broad
face, and an elderly lady in profile, with &s;everal other figures, boldly
painted, but not highly fini&s;hed, are &s;itting to &s;ee the tilt. On the
back ground is the French king's tent, and &s;everal figures dancing, re|joycing,
and preparing entertainments. A per&s;on &s;eems leading a
queen to the tent. Under this is written, &startq;The meeting of the kings
<PB N="100" REF="122">
between Guines and Arden in the Vale of Gold.&endq; This is an upright
piece. The third is the large&s;t, broad like the fir&s;t. Francis on his
throne at a di&s;tance with guards &amp;c. on each &s;ide in a line. Before him
&s;it on &s;tools with their backs towards you four per&s;ons in black, and
one like a clergyman &s;tanding in the middle and haranguing the king.
One each &s;ide &s;it noblemen, well drawn, coloured and neatly fini&s;hed.
On this piece is written, &startq;The great amba&s;&s;ade &s;ent to the French
king, of the earl of Worce&s;ter, lord chamberlain, the bi&s;hop of Ely, the
lord St. John, the lord Vaux and others.&endq; The&s;e pictures I &s;hould
not think of Holbein; the figures are more free than his, le&s;s fini&s;hed,
and the colouring fainter: and none of the Engli&s;h &s;eem portraits.
The &s;pelling too of <HI>Suffo,</HI> is French. Probably the&s;e pieces were done
by Janet, who was an able ma&s;ter, was contemporary with Holbein,
and who&s;e works are often confounded with our painter's.</P>
<P>Holbein's fame was &s;o thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sandrart.</NOTE> even in his life, that
the Italian ma&s;ters vouch&s;afed to borrow from him. In particular
Michael Angelo Caravaggio was much indebted to him in two differ|ent
pictures. Rubens was &s;o great an admirer of his works that he
advi&s;ed young Sandrart to &s;tudy his Dance of Death, from which Ru|bens
him&s;elf had made drawings.</P>

<P>The advancement of his &s;alary is a proof that Holbein was both

had practiced in his own country.</P>
<P>Henry, be&s;ides the&s;e painters had &s;everal arti&s;ts of note in his &s;er|vice.
The &s;uperb tomb of his father, &s;ays Stowe,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 499.</NOTE> was not fini&s;hed
'till the eleventh year of this king, 1519. It was made, adds the &s;ame
author, by one Peter, a painter of Florence, for which he received a
thou&s;and pounds, for the whole &s;tuff and workman&s;hip. This Peter,
Vertue di&s;covered to be, Pietro Torregiano, a valuable &s;culptor. That
he was here in the preceding year appears by a book of acts, orders,
decrees and records of the Court of Reque&s;ts printed in 1592 in quarto,
where it is &s;aid, p. 60, that in a cau&s;e between two Florentine mer|chants,
Peter de Bardi and Bernard Cavalcanti, heard before the coun|cil
at Greenwich, ma&s;ter Peter Tori&s;ano, a Florentine &s;culptor, was
one of the witne&s;&s;es. Va&s;ari &s;ays, that Torregiano having made &s;eve|ral
figures in marble and &s;mall bra&s;s, which were in the town-hall at
Florence, and drawn many things with &s;pirit and a good manner, in
competition with Michael Angelo (and con&s;equently could be no de$pi|cable

performer) was carried into England by &s;ome merchants, and en|tertained
in the king's &s;ervice, for whom he executed variety of works
in marble, bra&s;s, and wood, in concurrence with other ma&s;ters of this
country, over all whom he was allowed the &s;uperiority&mdash;He receiv|ed,
adds Va&s;ari, &s;uch noble rewards, that if he had not been a proud,
incon&s;iderate, ungovernable man, he might have lived in great felicity
and made a good end; but the contrary happened, for leaving Eng|land
and &s;ettling in Spain, after &s;everal performances there, he was
accu&s;ed of being a heretic,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In a pa&s;&s;ion he had broken an image of the Virgin, that he had ju&s;t carved.</NOTE> was thrown into the inqui&s;ition, tried
and condemned&mdash;the execution indeed was re&s;pited, but he became
melancholy mad and &s;tarved him&s;elf to death at Seville in 1522 in the
fiftieth year of his age.</P>
<P>Torregiano, it &s;eems, with Henry's turbulence of temper, had a|dopted
his religion, and yet, as he quitted England, one &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e
had not &s;upplene&s;s enough to plea&s;e the monarch, even after
that complai&s;ance. In the life of Benvenuto Cellini is farther evi|dence
of Torreggiano's being employed here, and of his di&s;putes with
Michael Angelo.</P>
<P>When Cellini was about &s;eventeen he &s;ays there arrived at Florence
a &s;culptor called Pietro Torreggiani, who came from England where
he had re&s;ided many years; this arti&s;t much frequenting Cellini's
ma&s;ter, told the former, that having a great work of bronze to execute
for the king of England, he was come to engage as many youths as
he could to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; and that Cellini being rather a &s;culptor than a
graver, Torreggiani offered to make his fortune if he would accom|pany
him to London. He was, adds Cellini, of a noble pre&s;ence, bold,
and with the air of a great &s;oldier rather than of a &s;tatuary, his admi|rable
<PB N="104" REF="126">
ge&s;tures, &s;onorous voice, and the action of his brow &s;triking with
amazement, ed ogni giorno ragionava delle &s;ue bravure con quelle be|&s;tie
di quelli Ingle&s;i, every day relating his brave treatment of tho&s;e
bea&s;ts the Engli&s;h. But as much &s;truck as Cellini was with this lofty
behaviour to us &s;avages, he took an aver&s;ion to his new ma&s;ter, on the
latter boa&s;ting of a blow in the face that he had given to the divine
Michael Angelo with his fi&s;t, the marks of which he would carry to his
grave. Others &s;ay that this event happened in the palace of the Car|dinal
de' Medici, Torreggiano being jealous of the &s;uperior honours
paid to Michael Angelo, who&s;e no&s;e was flattened by the blow. The
aggre&s;&s;or fled, and entered into the army, where he obtained a cap|tain's
commi&s;&s;ion, but being &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted with that life, he retired to
Florence, and from thence came to England.</P>

<P>IT is unlucky for the world, that our earlie&s;t ance&s;tors were not
aware of the curio&s;ity which would in&s;pire their de&s;cendents of
knowing minutely every thing relating to them. When they
placed three or four branches of trees acro&s;s the trunks of others and
covered them with boughs or &s;traw to keep out the weather, the good
people were not apprized that they were di&s;covering architecture, and
that it would be learnedly agitated &s;ome thou&s;and of years afterwards
who was the inventor of this &s;tupendous &s;cience. In complai&s;ance to
our inquiries they would undoubtedly have tran&s;mitted an account of
the fir&s;t hovel that was ever built, and from that patriarch hut we &s;hould
po&s;&s;e&s;s a faithfull genealogy of all it's de&s;cendents: Yet &s;uch a curio&s;ity
would de&s;troy much greater trea&s;ures; it would annihilate fables,
re&s;earches, conjectures, hypothe&s;es, di&s;putes, blunders and di&s;&s;ertations,
that library of human impertinence. Nece&s;&s;ity and a little common
&s;en&s;e produced all the common arts, which the plain folks who prac|ticed
them were not idle enough to record. Their inventions were
obvious, their productions u&s;efull and clum&s;y. Yet the little merit
<PB N="113" REF="135">
there was in fabricating them being &s;oon con&s;igned to oblivion, we are
bountifull enough to &s;uppo&s;e that there was de&s;ign and &s;y&s;tem in all
they did, and then take infinite pains to dige&s;t and methodize tho&s;e
imaginary rudiments. No &s;ooner is any aera of an invention invented,
but different countries begin to a&s;&s;ert an exclu&s;ive title to it, and the
only point in which any countries agree is perhaps in a&s;cribing the di&s;|covery
to &s;ome other nation remote enough in time for neither of them
to know any thing of it. Let but France and England once di&s;pute
which fir&s;t u&s;ed a hatchet, and they &s;hall never be accorded 'till the
chancery of learning accommodates the matter by pronouncing that
each received that invaluable uten&s;il from the Phoenicians. Common
&s;en&s;e that would interpo&s;e by ob&s;erving how probable it is that the ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of life were equally di&s;covered in every region, cannot be
heard; a hammer could only be invented by the Phoenicians, the fir&s;t
poli&s;hed people of whom we are totally ignorant. Whoever has thrown
away his time on the fir&s;t chapters of general hi&s;tories, or of hi&s;tories
of arts, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e reflections are but too well ground|ed.
I de&s;ign them as an apology for not going very far back into the
hi&s;tory of our architecture. Vertue and &s;everal other curious per&s;ons
have taken great pains to enlighten the ob&s;cure ages of that &s;cience;
they find no names of architects, nay little more, than what they might
have known without inquiring; that our ance&s;tors had buildings.
Indeed Tom Hearne, Brown Willis, and &s;uch illu&s;trators did &s;ometimes
go upon more po&s;itive ground: They did now and then &s;tumble up|on
an arch, a tower, nay a whole church, &s;o dark, &s;o ugly, &s;o uncouth,
that they were &s;ure it could not have been built &s;ince any idea of grace
had been tran&s;ported into the i&s;land. Yet with this inconte&s;table &s;ecu|rity
on their &s;ide, they &s;till had room for doubting; Danes, Saxons,
<PB N="114" REF="136">
Normans, were all ignorant enough to have claims to peculiar ugline&s;s
in their fa&s;hions. It was difficult to a&s;certain the period<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When men inquire, &startq;who invented Gothic buildings?&endq; they might as well a&s;k, &startq;who invented bad Latin?&endq; The former was a corruption of the Roman architecture, as the latter was of the Roman language. Both were deba&s;ed in bar|barous ages; both were refined, as the age poli&s;hed it&s;elf; but neither were re|&s;tored to the original &s;tandard. Beautifull Gothic architecture was engra$ted on Saxon deformity; and pure Italian &s;ucceeded to vitiated Latin.</NOTE> when one
ungracious form jo&s;tled out another: and this perplexity at la&s;t led
them into &s;uch refinement, that the term <HI>Gothic Architecture,</HI> inflicted
as a reproach on our ancient buildings in general by our ance&s;tors who
revived the Grecian ta&s;te, is now con&s;idered but as a &s;pecies of modern
elegance, by tho&s;e who wi&s;h to di&s;tingui&s;h the Saxon &s;tyle from it.
This Saxon &s;tyle begins to be defined by flat and round arches, by
&s;ome undulating zigzags on certain old fabrics, and by a very few other
characteri&s;tics, all evidences of barbarous and ignorant times. I do not
mean to &s;ay &s;imply that the round arch is a proof of ignorance; but
being &s;o natural, it is &s;imply, when unaccompanied by any gracefull
ornaments, a mark of a rude age&mdash;if attended by mi&s;hapen and heavy
decorations, a certain mark of it. The pointed arch, that peculiar of
Gothic architecture, was certainly intended as an improvement on the
circular, and the men who had not the happine&s;s of lighting on the &s;im|plicity
and proportion of the Greek orders, were however &s;o lucky as
to &s;trike out a thou&s;and graces and effects, which rendered their build|ings
magnificent, yet genteel, va&s;t, yet light,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For in&s;tance, the facade of the cathedral of Rheims.</NOTE> venerable and pictu|re&s;que.
It is difficult for the noble&s;t Grecian temple to convey half &s;o
many impre&s;&s;ions to the mind, as a cathedral does of the be&s;t Gothic
ta&s;te&mdash;a proof of &s;kill in the architects and of addre&s;s in the prie&s;ts
<PB N="115" REF="137">
who erected them. The latter exhau&s;ted their knowledge of the pa&s;|&s;ions
in compo&s;ing edifices who&s;e pomp, mechani&s;m, vaults, tombs,
painted windows, gloom and per&s;pectives infu&s;ed &s;uch &s;en&s;ations of ro|mantic
devotion; and they were happy in finding arti&s;ts capable of
executing &s;uch machinery. One mu&s;t have ta&s;te to be &s;en&s;ible of the
beauties of Grecian architecture; one only wants pa&s;&s;ions to feel
Gothic. In St. Peter's one is convinced that it was built by great
princes&mdash;In We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, one thinks not of the builder; the
religion of the place makes the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion&mdash;and though &s;tripped
of it's altars and &s;hrines, it is nearer converting one to popery than all
the regular pageantry of Roman domes. Gothic churches infu&s;e &s;u|per&s;tition;
Grecian, admiration. The papal &s;ee ama&s;&s;ed it's wealth by
Gothic cathedrals, and di&s;plays it in Grecian temples.</P>
<P>I certainly do not mean by this little contra&s;t to make any compari|&s;on
between the rational beauties of regular architecture, and the unre|&s;trained
licentiou&s;ne&s;s of that which is called Gothic. Yet I am clear
that the per&s;ons who executed the latter, had much more knowledge
of their art, more ta&s;te, more genius, and more propriety than we
chu&s;e to imagine. There is a magic hardine&s;s in the execution of &s;ome
of their works which would not have &s;u&s;tained them&s;elves if dictated by
mere caprice. There is a tradition that Sir Chri&s;topher Wren went
once a year to &s;urvey the roof of the chapel of King's college, and &s;aid
that if any man would &s;how him where to place the fir&s;t &s;tone, he
would engage to build &s;uch another. That there is great grace in &s;e|veral
places, even in their clu&s;ters of &s;lender pillars, and in the appli|cation
of their ornaments, though the principles of the latter are &s;o
confined that they may almo&s;t all be reduced to the trefoil, extended
<PB N="116" REF="138">
and varied, I &s;hall not appeal to the edifices them&s;elves&mdash;It is &s;ufficient
to ob&s;erve, that Inigo Jones, Sir Chri&s;topher Wren and Kent, who cer|tainly
under&s;tood beauty, blundered<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In Lincoln's-inn chapel, the &s;teeple of the church at Warwick, the king's-bench in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, the &s;creen at Glouce&s;ter &amp;c.</NOTE> into the heavie&s;t and clum&s;ie&s;t
compo&s;itions whenever they aimed at imitations of the Gothic&mdash;Is an
art de&s;picable in which a great ma&s;ter cannot &s;hine?</P>
<P>Con&s;idering how &s;crupulou&s;ly our architects confine them&s;elves to
antique precedent, perhaps &s;ome deviations into Gothic may a little re|lieve
them from that &s;ervile imitation. I mean that they &s;hould &s;tudy
both ta&s;tes, not blend them: that they &s;hould dare to invent in the one,
&s;ince they will hazard nothing in the other. When they have built a
pediment and portico, the Sibyll's circular temple, and tacked the wings
to a hou&s;e by a colonade, they &s;eem <HI>au bout de leur Latin.</HI> If half a
dozen man&s;ions were all that remained of old Rome, in&s;tead of half a
dozen temples, I do not doubt but our churches would re&s;emble the
private hou&s;es of Roman citizens. Our buildings mu&s;t be as Vitru|vian,
as writings in the days of Era&s;mus were obliged to be Ciceronian.
Yet confined as our architects are to few models, they are far from
having made all the u&s;e they might of tho&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;s. There are
variations enough to be &s;truck out to furni&s;h new &s;cenes of &s;ingular
beauty. The application of loggias, arcades, terra&s;&s;es and flights of
&s;teps, at different &s;tages of a building, particularly in &s;uch &s;ituations as
Whitehall to the river, would have a magnificent effect. It is true, our
climate and the expence of building in England are great re&s;trictions
on imagination; but when one talks of the extent of which architec|ture
is capable, one mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that pomp and beauty are the prin|cipal
objects; one &s;peaks of palaces and public buildings; not of &s;hops
<PB N="117" REF="139">
and &s;mall hou&s;es&mdash;but I mu&s;t re&s;train this di&s;&s;ertation, and come to
the hi&s;toric part, which will lie in a &s;mall compa&s;s.</P>
<P>Felibien took great pains to a&s;certain the revival of architecture, af|ter
the de&s;truction of the true ta&s;te by the inundation of the northern
nations; but his di&s;coveries were by no means an&s;werable to his labour.
Of French builders he did find a few names, and here and there an
Italian or German. Of Engli&s;h he owns he did not meet with $he lea&s;t
trace; while at the &s;ame time the founders of ancient buildings were
every where recorded: &s;o carefull have the monks (the only hi&s;torians
of tho&s;e times) been to celebrate bigotry and pa&s;s over the arts. But I
own I take it for granted that the&s;e &s;eeming omi&s;&s;ions are to be attri|buted
to their want of per&s;picuity rather than to neglect. As all the
other arts<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The arts flouri&s;hed &s;o much in convents to the la&s;t, that one Gyffard, a vi&s;itor employed by Thomas Cromwell to make a report of the &s;tate of tho&s;e &s;ocietie previous to their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, pleads in behalf of the hou&s;e of Wol&s;trop, &startq;That there was not one religious per&s;on there, but that he could and did u&s;e, either embrotheryng, writing books with very fair hand, making their own garments, <HI>carving, painting, graffing.</HI>&endq; Strype's memor. vol. i. p. 255.</NOTE> were confined to cloy&s;ters, &s;o undoubtedly was architecture
too; and when we read that &s;uch a bi&s;hop or &s;uch an abbot built &s;uch

well as furni&s;hed the nece&s;&s;ary funds; but as tho&s;e chroniclers &s;carce ever

<P>Felibien is &s;o impartial an author, that he does not even reject the
fables with which our own writers have repleni&s;hed the cha&s;ms in our
hi&s;tory. He quotes Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter for the flouri&s;hing con|dition
<PB N="118" REF="140">
of architecture in Britain at a time when indeed neither that nor
any other &s;cience flouri&s;hed here&mdash;King Arthur, &s;ay they,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Felib. vol. v. p. 165.</NOTE> cau&s;ed
many churches and con&s;iderable edifices to be erected here. It would
in truth have been an act of inju&s;tice to us to omit this vi&s;ion, in a man
who on the authority of Agathias, relates that the emperor Ju&s;tinian
had in his &s;ervice one Anthemius, &s;o able a <HI>mathematician</HI> that he could
make artificial earthquakes, and actually did revenge him&s;elf by &s;uch
an experiment on one Zeno a rhetorician. The machinery was ex|tremely
&s;imple, and yet I que&s;tion whether the greate&s;t mathematician
of this age is expert enough to produce the &s;ame effect; it con&s;i&s;ted in
nothing but placing &s;everal caldrons of hot water again&s;t the walls of
Zeno's hou&s;e. The &s;ame author has cited Procopius for the origine
of dams to re&s;train the cour&s;e of rivers, the method of who&s;e con&s;truc|tion
was revealed to Chry&s;es, an architect of Alexandria, in a dream.
Dreams, lies, and ab&s;urdities are all one finds in &s;earching into early
times. In a &s;carcity of facts probability was the la&s;t thing to which
&s;uch authors attended, and con&s;equently they left a mark by which, if

invented.</P>

&s;o many Italians were entertained in the king's &s;ervice. They had &s;een
that architecture revived in their own country in all it's purity&mdash;but
<PB N="122" REF="144">
whether they were not perfectly ma&s;ters of it, or that it was nece&s;&s;ary
to introduce the innovation by degrees, it certainly did not at fir&s;t ob|tain
full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It was plai&s;tered upon Gothic, and made a barba|rous
mixture. Regular columns, with ornaments, neither Grecian nor
Gothic, and half embroidered with foliage, were crammed over fron|ti&s;pieces,
facades and chimnies, and lo&s;t all grace by wanting &s;implici|ty.
This mungrel &s;pecies la&s;ted 'till late in the reign of James the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The beginning of reformation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Brunelle&s;chi began to reform architecture in the fourteenth century. See Voltaire. Hi&s;t. Univ. vol. ii. p. 179.</NOTE> in building &s;eems owing to Hol|bein.
His porch at Wilton, though purer than the works of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors,

gracefull and well cho&s;en. I have &s;een of his drawings too in the

it was adopted from his acquaintance with his fellow-labourers at court.
Henry had actually an Italian architect in his &s;ervice, to whom I &s;hould

<P>This grant was renewed to him in the third of Edward VI. From

<P>Henry had another architect of much note in his time, but who ex|celled

al&s;o introduced) This was Sir Richard Lea ma&s;ter ma&s;on, and ma&s;ter

in Hertford&s;hire, and he him&s;elf be&s;towed a brazen font on the church
of Verulam, or St. Alban's, within a mile of which place out of the
ruins of the abbey he built a &s;eat called Lees-place. The font was
taken in the Scotti&s;h wars, and had &s;erved for the chri&s;tening of the
royal children of that kingdom. A pompous in&s;cription<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See it in Camden's Britannia p. 355. vol. i. edit. 1722.</NOTE> was engrav|ed

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">State of Painting under EDWARD VI. and MARY.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER a minor prince, and amid&s;t a &s;truggle of religions, we
are not likely to meet with much account of the arts. No|body
was at lei&s;ure to mind or record them. Yet the &s;eeds
&s;own by Henry were not eradicated; Holbein was &s;till alive. We have
&s;een that he was cho&s;en to celebrate the in&s;titution of Bridewell. He
drew the young king more than once after he came to the crown.</P>
<P>Among the &s;tores of old pictures at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e was one, paint|ed
on a long board, repre&s;enting the head of Edward VI. to be di&s;cern|ed
only by the reflection of a cylindric mirrour. On the &s;ide of the
head was a land&s;cape, not ill done. On the frame was written Guiliel|mus
pinxit. This was probably
<Q>MARC WILLEMS,</Q>
Who was born at Antwerp about 1527, and was &s;cholar of Michael
Coxie. He was reckoned to &s;urpa&s;s his cotemporaries in his manner
and facility of compo&s;ing. This picture is the &s;ole evidence of his
having been in England: in his own country he painted the decolla|tion
<PB N="126" REF="148" MS="Y">
of St. John, &s;till extant in the church of St. Rombout, for which
too he drew the &s;tory of Judith and Holofernes. When Philip II.
made his public entry into Mechlin in 1549, Willems was employed
to paint a triumphal arch, on which he repre&s;ented the hi&s;tory of
Dido. He made de&s;igns for mo&s;t of the painters, gla&s;s-painters and
arras-makers of his time, and died lamented in 1561.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See De&s;camps and Sandrart.</NOTE></P>
<P>Another picture of Edward VI. was in the collection of Charles I.
painted by Hans Hueet, of whom nothing el&s;e is known. It was &s;old
for 20<HI>l.</HI> in the Civil War.</P>
<P>There was another painter who lived at this time, of whom Vertue
found an account in a MS. of Nicholas Hilliard, but never di&s;covered
any of his works. As this per&s;on is &s;o much commended by a brother
arti&s;t, one may believe he had merit, and as the te&s;timony may lead to
farther inve&s;tigation, I &s;hall give the extract in the author's own words;</P>
<P>&startq;Neverthele&s;s, if a man be &s;o induced by nature, and live in time
of trouble and under a government wherein arts be not e&s;teemed, and
him&s;elf but of &s;mall means, woe be unto him, as unto an untimely
birth; for of my own knowledge, it hath made poor men poorer, as
among&s;t others many, that mo&s;t rare Engli&s;h drawer of &s;tory works
in black and white.
<Q>JOHN BOSSAM.</Q>
One for his &s;kill worthy to have been &s;erjeant-painter to any king or
emperor, who&s;e works in that kind are comparable with the be&s;t what|&s;oever
in cloth, and in di&s;temper-colours for black and white; who
being very poor, and belike wanting to buy fairer colours, wrought
<PB N="127" REF="149">
therefore for the mo&s;t part in white and black; and growing yet poorer
by charge of children, &amp;c. gave painting clean over: but being a very
fair-conditioned, zealous and godly per&s;on, grew into a love of God's
divine &s;ervice upon the liberty of the go&s;pel at the coming in of queen
Elizabeth, and became a reading mini&s;ter; only unfortunate, becau&s;e
he was Engli&s;h born, for even the &s;trangers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">King Philip and the Spaniards.</NOTE> would otherwi&s;e have &s;et
him up.&endq;</P>
<P>The protector was magnificent, and had he lived to compleat Somer|&s;et-hou&s;e,
would probably have called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e arti&s;ts
who&s;e works are the noble&s;t furniture. I have already mentioned his
portrait by Holbein. His ambitious duche&s;s Anne Stanhope and her
&s;on are pre&s;erved in a &s;mall piece<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is a head of her too at Sion, and Mr. Bateman has given me another in &s;mall, with a portrait of the protector in her hand; painted probably after his death.</NOTE> of oil-colours at Petworth, but I
know not who the painter was, nor of the portrait of the protector's
brother, admiral Seymour, at Longleat. A miniature of the &s;ame per|&s;on
is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mrs. George Grenville. Of the admiral's
creature Sir William Sherrington there are two or three pictures ex|tant;
one, among Holbein's drawings at Ken&s;ington. This man was
ma&s;ter of the mint, and was convicted by his own confe&s;&s;ion of great
frauds.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype's memorials vol. ii. p. 123.</NOTE> He put the mint of Bri&s;tol into the hands of the admiral, who
was to take thence 10,000<HI>l.</HI> per month for his rebellious purpo&s;es.
Yet Sherrington was pardoned and re&s;tored. It has never been ob|&s;erved,
but I &s;uppo&s;e the lightne&s;s which is remarked in the coins of
Edward VI. was owing to the embezzlements of this per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="150">
Now I am mentioning the mint, I &s;hall take notice that among the
patent-rolls is a grant in the 6th of Edward to Antony Deric of the
office of capital &s;culptor of the monies in the tower of London; and at
the end of the &s;ame year John Brown is appointed during plea&s;ure &s;ur|veyor
of the coins. Clement Adams has a grant to in&s;truct the king's
henchmen or pages; an office he retained under queen Elizabeth.
In Hackluyt's voyages,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Page 270.</NOTE> that of Richard Chanceler to Cathay is &s;aid
to be written in Latin by that learned young man Clement Adams.</P>
<P>Of the protector's rival, Dudley duke of Northumberland, there is
a good head in the chamber at Knowle, where there are &s;o many cu|rious
portraits, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a&s;&s;embled by the trea&s;urer Buck|hur&s;t.</P>
<P>Another per&s;on of &s;ome note in this reign was Sir John God&s;alve,
created knight of the carpet at the king's coronation;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Strype.</NOTE> and commi&s;|&s;ioner
of vi&s;itation the &s;ame year;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heylin.</NOTE> and in the third year comptroller
of the mint. His portrait is in the clo&s;et at Ken&s;ington, and Vertue
mentions another in miniature, drawn by John Betts,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vertue &s;ays that Betts learned of Hilliard.</NOTE> (who he &s;ays
was an e&s;teemed painter in the reign of queen Elizabeth) On this pic|ture
was written, captum in ca&s;tris ad Boloniam 1540; with his arms,
party per pale gules and azure, on a fe&s;s wavy argent, between three
cro&s;lets pattee, or, as many cre&s;cents &s;able. The knight was drawn
with a &s;pear and &s;hield. This picture belonged to Chri&s;topher God|&s;alve,
clerk of the victualling-office in the reign of Charles I. in who&s;e
<PB N="129" REF="151">
cau&s;e he lo&s;t 7000<HI>l.</HI> and was near being hanged. He was employed
by Charles II. in the navy-office and lived to 1694.</P>
<P>Guillim Stretes was painter to king Edward; in 1551 &startq;He had
paid him, &s;ays Strype,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 494.</NOTE> fifty marks for recompence of three great ta|bles
made by the &s;aid Guillim, whereof two were the pictures of his
highne&s;s, &s;ent to Sir Thomas Hoby, and Sir John Ma&s;on (amba&s;&s;adors
abroad) the third a picture of the late earl of Surrey attainted, and by
the council's commandment fetched from the &s;aid Guillim's hou&s;e.&endq;
The peculiarity of the&s;e la&s;t words induce me to think that I have di&s;|covered
this very picture. In my father's collection was a very large
piece repre&s;enting that unfortunate lord, at whole length, leaning on
a broken column, with this motto, Sat &s;upere&s;t, and other devices,
particularly the arms of England, one of the articles of his impeach|ment,
and only the initial letters of his name. This was evidently
painted after his death, and as his father was &s;till detained in pri&s;on du|ring
the whole reign of Edward, it cannot be probable that a portrait
of the &s;on, with &s;uch marks of honour, &s;hould be drawn by order of the
court. On the contrary, it's <HI>being fetched from Guillim's hou&s;e by the
council's commandment,</HI> &s;eems to imply that it was &s;eized by their order.
It is now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his grace the duke of Norfolk.</P>
<P>Architecture pre&s;erved in this reign the footing it had acquired un|der
the la&s;t king. Somer&s;et-hou&s;e is a compound of Grecian and
Gothic. It was built on the &s;cite of Che&s;ter inn, where the ancient
poet Occleve formerly lived. As the pen&s;ion to John of Padua was
renewed in the third of this king, one may &s;uppo&s;e that he owed it to
the protector, and was the architect of his palace. In the &s;ame &s;tyle

Thynne, a principal officer to the protector.</P>
<P>1553.</P>
<P>The reign of Mary, though &s;horter even than that of her brother,
makes a much more con&s;iderable figure in the annals of painting. It
was di&s;tingui&s;hed by more good painters than one; the principal was
<Q>Sir ANTONIO MORE.</Q>
He was a native of Utrecht, and &s;cholar of John Schorel,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Schorel was &s;cholar of Mabu&s;e, and was a poet, mu&s;ician and orator. See an account of him in Sandrart, p. 235.</NOTE> but &s;eems
to have &s;tudied the manner of Holbein, to which he approached nearer
than to the freedom of de&s;ign in the works of the great ma&s;ters, that
he &s;aw at Rome. Like Holbein he was a clo&s;e imitator of nature, but
did not arrive at his extreme delicacy of fini&s;hing; on the contrary,
Antonio &s;ometimes &s;truck into a bold and ma&s;culine &s;tyle, with a good
knowledge of the Chiaro Scuro. In 1522 he drew Philip II. and was
recommended by cardinal Granvelle to Charles V. who &s;ent him to
Portugal, where he painted John III. the king, Catherine of Au&s;tria
his queen, and the infanta Mary, fir&s;t wife of Philip. For the&s;e three

&s;ent by cardinal Granvelle to the emperor, who ordered two hundred
florins to Antonio. He remained in England during the reign of
Mary, and was much employed, but having neglected, as is frequent,
to write the names on the portraits he drew, mo&s;t of them have lo&s;t
part of their value, by our ignorance of the per&s;ons repre&s;ented. The
poore&s;t performers have it in their power to add &s;o much merit to their
works, as can be conferred by identifying the &s;ubjects, which would
be a little reparation to the curious world, though &s;ome families &s;hould
mi&s;s imaginary ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>On the death of the queen, More followed Philip [and probably
his religion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He was &s;u&s;pected by the inqui&s;ition of making u&s;e of his intere&s;t with the king in favour of his countrymen, &s;ays Sandrart. This might be meant either of their religious or political principles. But &s;ure the inqui&s;itors knew Philip too well to be apprehen&s;ive of his li&s;tening to any in&s;inuations of tenderne&s;s on either head.</NOTE>] into Spain, where he was indulged in &s;o much familia|rity,
that one day the king &s;lapping him pretty roughly on the
&s;houlder, More returned the &s;port with his hand&s;tick: A &s;trange li|berty
to be taken with a Spani&s;h monarch, and with &s;uch a monarch!
His biographer gives but an awkward account of the &s;equel; and I
<PB N="132" REF="155">
repeat it as I find it. A grande&egrave; interpo&s;ed for his pardon, and he was
permitted to retire to the Netherlands, but under promi&s;e of returning
again to Spain. I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e that he was promi&s;ed to have
leave to return thither, after a temporary bani&s;hment; and this &s;uppo|&s;ition
is the more likely, as Philip, for once forgetting maje&s;ty in his
love of the arts, di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to recall him, before he had
fini&s;hed his journey. But the painter &s;en&s;ible of the danger he had
e&s;caped, mode&s;tly excu&s;ed him&s;elf: and yet, &s;ays the &s;tory, the king
be&s;towed noble pre&s;ents and places on his children. At Utrecht An|tonio
found the duke of Alva, and was employed by him to draw &s;e|veral
of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and was made receiver of the revenues of We&s;t-Flanders;
a preferment, with which, they &s;ay, he was &s;o elated, that
he burned his ea&s;el, and gave away his painting tools.</P>
<P>More was a man of a &s;tately and hand&s;ome pre&s;ence; and often went
to Bru&s;&s;els, where he lived magnificently. He died at Antwerp in
1575 in the 56th year of his age.</P>
<P>His portrait, painted by him&s;elf, is in the chamber of painters at
Florence, with which the great duke, who bought it, was &s;o plea&s;ed,
that he ordered a cartel with &s;ome Greek ver&s;es, written by Antonio
Maria Salvini, his Greek profe&s;&s;or, to be affixed to the frame. Salvini
tran&s;lated them into Italian and into the following Latin,
<Q><L>Papae! e&s;t imago cujus,</L>

<P>Another picture of him&s;elf, and one of his wife, were in the collec|tion
of Sir Peter Lely. More's was three feet eight inches high, by
two feet nine wide. King Charles had five pictures painted by this
ma&s;ter; and the duke of Buckingham had a portrait of a man by
him. See his catalogue p. 18. A print of him in profile was publi&s;bed
by Hondius, and a medal &s;truck of him in Italy with this legend, Ant.
More, pictor tran&s;montanus. At what time or where he was knighted
is uncertain. He painted his ma&s;ter John Schorel in 1560. Several
of his works are or were at Sir Philip Sydenham's at Brympton in So|mer&s;et&s;hire.
A very good portrait of Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham is at
Houghton. I have a miniature by him, called Thomas duke of
Norfolk, engraved among the illu&s;trious heads: it belonged to Rich|ard&s;on
the painter, and came out of the Arundelian collection; and a
half length of a lady in black with a gold chain about her wa&s;te, which
is mentioned in the catalogue of pictures of James II. and by that of
Charles I. appears<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See p. 108. No. 7.</NOTE> to be Margaret of Valois, &s;i&s;ter of Henry II. of
France, and duche&s;s of Savoy, at the tournament for who&s;e wedding
that monarch was killed. Lady Elizabeth Germayn has the portrait
of Anne daughter of Francis earl of Bedford and wife of Ambro&s;e
earl of Warwick.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="157">
At New&s;tede abbey in Nottingham&s;hire, the beautifull &s;eat of the
lord Byron, where are the mo&s;t perfect remains of an ancient convent,
is an admirable portrait, painted as I believe by this ma&s;ter, and wor|thy
of Holbein. It is a half length of a fat man with a beard, on a
light greeni&s;h ground. His arms are, three ro&s;es, the middle one
highe&s;t, on a field argent; in ba&s;e, &s;omething like a green hill: The&s;e
arms are repeated on his ring, and over them, J. N. aet. 1557. As
this bearing is evidently foreign, I &s;uppo&s;e the portrait repre&s;ents one
of the family of Numigen. Nicholas Byron married Sophia, daughter
of Lambert Charles of Numigen.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Thoroton's Nottingham&s;hire, p. 261.</NOTE></P>
<P>But More did not always confine him&s;elf to portraits. He painted
&s;everal hi&s;toric pieces, particularly one much e&s;teemed of the re&s;urrec|tion
of Chri&s;t with two angels; and another of Peter and Paul. A
painter, who afterwards &s;old it to the prince of Cond&egrave;, got a great
deal of money by &s;howing it at the foire St. Germain.</P>
<P>He made a fine copy of Titian's Danae for the king; and left un|fini&s;hed
the Circumci&s;ion, de&s;igned for the altar in the church of our
Lady at Antwerp.</P>
<P>In the catalogue of pictures at the palais royal is a portrait &s;aid to
be of Grotius by Antonio More, who was dead above twenty years
before Grotius was born.</P>
<P>Another performer in this reign was
<Q>JOAS VAN CLEEVE,</Q>

perfection he might have attained, his head was turned with vanity; a
misfortune not uncommon to the profe&s;&s;ion, who living &s;ecluded from
the world and &s;eeing little but their own creation ri&s;ing around them,
grow intoxicated with the magic of their own performances. Cleeve
came to England, expecting great prices for his pictures from king
Philip, who was making a collection, but unluckily, &s;ome of the works
of Titian arrived at the &s;ame time. Cleeve begged the recommenda|tion
of Sir Antonio More, his countryman; but Philip was too much
charmed with the beauties of the Venetian ma&s;ter, and overlooked the
labours of the Fleming. This neglect compleated his frenzy, the &s;torm
of which fir&s;t vented it&s;elf on Sir Antonio. Cleeve abu&s;ed him, un|dervaluing
his works, and bidding him return to Utrecht and keep his
wife from the canons. At la&s;t the poor man grew quite frantic,
painted his own cloaths, and &s;poiled his own pictures, 'till they were
obliged to confine him, in which wretched condition he probably died.
He had a &s;on that followed his profe&s;&s;ion, and was, it is &s;aid, no de&s;|picable
performer.</P>

<P>Vertue found grants in this reign to another painter, who, it &s;eems,
had been in the &s;ervice too of Henry and Edward. His name was
<HI>Nicholas Ly&s;ard;</HI> he had a pen&s;ion for life of ten pounds a year, and
the &s;ame fee charged on the cu&s;toms, as had been granted to the
&s;erjeant-painters John Brown and Andrew Wright&mdash;Of Ly&s;ard I find
no farther mention, but that in a roll of queen Elizabeth's new-years
gifts he pre&s;ents her with a table painted of the hi&s;tory of Aha&s;uerus,
and her maje&s;ty gives him one gilt creu&s;e and cover. This was in the
fir&s;t year of her reign. He died in her &s;ervice 1570. In the regi&s;ter

void of intere&s;ted ambition, declined a crown, and preferred the
younger &s;i&s;ter, the prince&s;s Elizabeth. For this partiality, and on
the ri&s;ing of the Carews in Devon&s;hire who were flattered with

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Painters in the Reign of Queen ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<P>THE long and remarkable reign of this Prince&s;s could not but
furni&s;h many opportunities to arti&s;ts of &s;ignalizing them&s;elves.
There is no evidence that Elizabeth had much ta&s;te for
painting; but &s;he loved pictures of her&s;elf. In them &s;he could appear
really hand&s;ome; and yet to do the profe&s;&s;ion ju&s;tice, they &s;eem to
have flattered her the lea&s;t of all her dependents: There is not a
&s;ingle portrait of her that one can call beautifull. The profu&s;ion of
ornaments with which they are loaded, are marks of her continual
fondne&s;s for dre&s;s, while they entirely exclude all grace, and leave no
more room for a painter's genius than if he had been employed to
copy an Indian idol, totally compo&s;ed of hands and necklaces. A pale
Roman no&s;e, a head of hair loaded with crowns and powdered with
diamonds, a va&s;t ruff, a va&s;ter fardingale and a bu&s;hell of pearls are
the features by which every body knows at once the pictures of queen
Elizabeth.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is ob&s;ervable that her maje&s;ty thought enormity of dre&s;s a royal prerogative, for on the 12th of February 1579, an order was made in the Star-chamber, &startq;that no per&s;on &s;hould u&s;e or wear exce&s;&s;ive long cloaks (this might proceed from ap|prehen&s;ion of their concealing arms under them) as of late be u&s;ed, and before two years pa&s;t hath not been u&s;ed in this realm; no per&s;ons to wear &s;uch great ruffes about their necks; to be left off &s;uch mon&s;trous undecent attyring.&endq; Al&s;o another again&s;t wearing any &s;word rapier, that &s;hall pa&s;&s;e the length of one yard and half a quarter in the blade, nor dagger above twelve inches in the blade at mo&s;t. In her father's time, who dictated in every thing from religion to fa&s;hions, an act of parliament was pa&s;&s;ed in his twenty-fourth year again&s;t inordinate u&s;e of apparel, directing that no one &s;hould wear on his apparel any cloth of gold, &s;ilver or tin&s;el, &s;atyn, &s;ilk, or cloth mixed with gold or &s;ilver, any &s;ables, velvet, furrs, embroidery, velvet in gowns or outermo&s;t garments, EXCEPT PERSONS OF DI|STINCTION, dukes, marqui&s;&s;es, $arls, barons and knights of the order, barons' &s;ons, knights or &s;uch that may di&s;pend 250<HI>l.</HI> per ann. This act was renewed in the &s;econd of Elizabeth. Edward VI. carried this re&s;traint &s;till farther: In heads of a bill drawn up with his own hand 1551, (though it never pa&s;&s;ed into a law) no one, who had le&s;s than 100<HI>l.</HI> a year for life, or gentlemen, the king's &s;worn &s;er|vants, was to wear &s;atten, dama&s;k, o&s;trich-feathers, or furs of conies; none not worth 200<HI>l.</HI> or 20<HI>l.</HI> in living certain, to wear chamblet: no &s;erving man, under the degree of a gentleman, to wear any $ur, &s;ave lamb; nor cloth above ten &s;hil|ling the yard.</NOTE> Be&s;ides many of her maje&s;ty, we are &s;o lucky as to po&s;&s;e&s;s
the portraits of almo&s;t all the great men of her reign, and though the
<PB N="140" REF="165">
generality of painters at that time were not equal to the &s;ubjects on
which they were employed, yet they were clo&s;e imitators of nature, and
have perhaps tran&s;mitted more faithfull repre&s;entations, than we could
have expected from men of brighter imagination. The fir&s;t painter
who &s;eems to have made any figure in this reign, was
<Q>LUCAS DE HEERE;</Q>
Born at G$ent in 1534, of a family peculiarly addicted to the arts.
John his father was a good &s;tatuary and architect: Anne Smitter his
<PB N="141" REF="166">
mother painted in miniature, and with &s;uch diminutive neatne&s;s, that
&s;he executed a land&s;cape with a windmill, millers, a cart and hor&s;e and
pa&s;&s;engers; and half a grain of corn would cover the whole compo&s;i|tion.
The father went often to Namur and Dinant, where the &s;on
copied ruins and ca&s;tles; but he &s;oon learned of a better ma&s;ter, Fran|cis
Floris, under whom Lucas improved much, and drew many de&s;igns
(which pa&s;&s;ed for his ma&s;ter's) for tape&s;try and gla&s;s-painters. From
Ghent he went to France and was employed by the queen and queen-mother
in making drawings for tape&s;try; and re&s;iding &s;ome time at
Fontainbleau, where he married Eleanor Carboniere, he contracted a
ta&s;te for the antique by &s;eeing the &s;tatues there, an inclination he &s;how|ed
le&s;s by his own works, than by making a collection of bronzes and
medals. He returned to Ghent, where he drew the Count de Vaken,
his lady and their je&s;ter, and painted two or three churches; in St. Pe|ter's,
the &s;hutters of an altar piece, in which he repre&s;ented the Lord's
Supper, much admired for the draperies of the apo&s;tles. In St. John's
church he painted an altar-piece of the Re&s;urrection, and on the doors
of it, Chri&s;t and the di&s;ciples at Emaus, and his apparition in the
garden.</P>
<P>Lucas was not only a painter, but a poet: He wrote the Orchard of
Poe&s;ie; and tran&s;lated from the French of Marot, the Temple of Cu|pid
and other pieces. He had begun the lives of the Flemi&s;h painters
in ver&s;e. Carl Vermander his &s;cholar, who has given the lives of tho&s;e
ma&s;ters, learned many anecdotes of our Engli&s;h painters from Lucas.</P>
<P>At what time the latter arrived in England is not certain: nor were
his works at all known here, 'till the indefatigable indu&s;try of Mr.
Vertue di&s;covered &s;everal of them.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="167">
1. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was a portrait of Sir William Sidney, grand|father
of Sir Philip; but as Sir William died in 1553 at the age of 72,
when Lucas de Heere was but nineteen, it is not probable that Sir
William was abroad after that young man was in repute enough to
draw his picture; and it is le&s;s probable that he had been in France,
had married and arrived here by the age of nineteen. This picture
which Vertue found at Pen&s;hur&s;t, was in all likelyhood a copy.</P>
<P>2. The next was a portrait of Henry lord Maltravers elde&s;t &s;on of
Henry Fitzalan earl of Arundel, dated 1557, the year before the ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of queen Elizabeth; but as this young lord died at Bru&s;&s;els,
it is probable that De Heere drew his picture there, and that very ac|quaintance
might have been a recommendation of Lucas to England.</P>
<P>3. The third is a picture in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, well known by the print
Vertue made from it. It contains the portraits of Frances duche&s;s of
Suffolk, mother of lady Jane Grey, and her &s;econd hu&s;band Adrian
Stoke. Their ages, and De Heere's mark # are on the picture,
which is in perfect pre&s;ervation, the colouring of the heads clear, and
with great nature, and the draperies which are black with furs and
jewels, highly fini&s;hed and round, though the manner of the whole is
a little &s;tiff. This picture was in the collection of lord Oxford.
There is a tradition that when this great lady made this &s;econd match
with a young fellow who was only ma&s;ter of her hor&s;e, queen Eliza|beth
&s;aid, &startq;What! has &s;he married her hor&s;e-keeper? Yes, madam,
replied my lord Burleigh, and &s;he &s;ays your maje&s;ty would like to do
&s;o too.&endq;&mdash;Leice&s;ter was ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e. The date on this picture
is 1559.</P>
<P>4. lord Darnley, hu&s;band of Mary queen of Scots, and his brother
<PB N="143" REF="168">
Charles Stuart, a boy, afterwards father of the lady Arabella. There
are two of the&s;e; one as large as life, in the room going into the king's
clo&s;et at St. James's; the other &s;mall and neatly fini&s;hed in the private
apartments below &s;tairs at Hampton-court. The date 1569.</P>
<P>5. The next is a very remarkable picture on board at Ken&s;ington:
Queen Elizabeth richly dre&s;t, with her crown, &s;cepter, and globe, is
coming out of a palace with two female attendants. Juno, Pallas, and
Minerva &s;eem flying before her; Juno drops her &s;cepter, and Venus
her ro&s;es; Cupid flings away his bow and arrows, and clings to his
mother. On the old frame remain the&s;e lines, probably written by
the painter him&s;elf, who, we have &s;een, dabled in poetry too;
<Q><L>Juno potens &s;ceptris, et mentis acumine Pallas,</L>
<L>Et ro&s;eo Veneris fulget in ore decor;</L>
<L>Ad&s;uit Elizabeth; Juno percul&s;a refugit;</L>
<L>Ob&s;tupuit Pallas, erubuitque Venus.</L></Q></P>
<P>To have compleated the flattery, he &s;hould have made Juno or
Venus re&s;emble the queen of Scots, and not &s;o hand&s;ome as Elizabeth,
who would not have blu&s;hed like the la&s;t godde&s;s.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Another curious picture painted about the &s;ame time, I know not by what hand, is in the collection of James We&s;t, e&s;&abque; It repre&s;ents Henry VIII. &s;itting under a canopy &s;upported by pillars and delivering the &s;word to prince Edward. On the right hand of the king &s;tand Philip and Mary; Mars is coming in behind them.

be of De Heere, who&s;e mark is &s;till di&s;cernible. It is the portrait of
Mary Neville daughter of George lord Abergavenny, and widow of
Thomas Fienes lord Dacre, executed for an accidental murder in the
reign of Henry VIII. a picture of her hu&s;band, a$t. 22, 1549, copied

whole family. The figures are le&s;s than life, and about half lengths.
An elderly gentleman is at table with his wife, and another lady, pro|bably
from the re&s;emblance, her &s;i&s;ter. The fir&s;t lady has tags of a
particular form, exactly like tho&s;e on the dre&s;s of my duche&s;s of Suf|folk,
as is the colouring, though not &s;o highly fini&s;hed; yet the heads
have great nature. Before them are &s;even young children, their ages
marked, which &s;how that three of them were born at a birth. They
are playing with fruit, and by them are a parrot and a monkey: but
the animals and fruit are much inferior to the figures. There are &s;ome
Latin ver&s;es in commendation of the gentleman, who&s;e name or title
was <HI>Cobham.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e Sir George Brooke lord Cobham, who died
in the fir&s;t year of queen Elizabeth, leaving eight &s;ons and two daugh|ters.
He had been committed to the tower by queen Mary, as privy
to Wyat's rebellion. I have likewi&s;e found two more pieces of this
ma&s;ter at Drayton, the ancient ca&s;tle-like man&s;ion of the Mordaunts,
now of the lady Elizabeth Germain. One is a half length of Marga|ret
Audley &s;econd wife of Thomas duke of Norfolk beheaded temp.
Eliz. Her arms and titles are on the back ground: but the picture
has &s;uffered. The other, of the &s;ame &s;ize, is of a young nobleman, in
a white &s;tiff-bodied habit, black cloak and hat; he is very &s;warthy but
hand&s;ome. His age 22, 1563. This piece is finely pre&s;erved and
&s;trongly coloured. In the life of Holbein I have mentioned the Henry
VIII. at Trinity Coll. Cambridge, with De Heere's mark. The $ace
has been repainted, but the re&s;t of the body is highly fini&s;hed, and does
great honour to the copyi&s;t.</P>
<P>In 1570 Lucas was employed to paint a gallery for Edward earl of
Lincoln, the lord high admiral.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">At the duke of Bedford's at Woburn are two heads of a counte&s;s of Lincoln and of lady Anne Ay&s;cough, daughter of the earl. As they are evidently painted at the &s;ame time, and as the daughter appears the elder per&s;on, there is great rea|&s;on to believe that the counte&s;s was only the mother-in-law, and con&s;equently that this portrait repre&s;ents the fair Geraldine, &s;o much celebrated by the earl of Surrey. Her chief beauty &s;eems to have been her golden hair.

man with cloth of different &s;orts lying by him, and a pair of &s;heers, as
a &s;atire on our ficklene&s;s in fa&s;hions. This thought was borrowed from
Andrew Borde, who in his introduction of knowledge, to the fir&s;t
chapter prefixed a naked Engli&s;hman, with the&s;e lines,
<Q><L>I am an Engli&s;hman, and naked I &s;tand here,</L>
<L>Mu&s;ing in my mind what rayment I &s;hall wear.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is not extraordinary that this wittici&s;m &s;hould have been adopted into the lord admiral's gallery.

He had been a Carthu&s;ian, then rambled over many parts of the world, turned phy&s;ician, and at la&s;t wrote again&s;t the marriage of prie&s;ts; for which I conclude (though Antony Wood could not gue&s;s the rea&s;on) he was &s;hut up in pri&s;on, where &s;ome &s;aid he poi&s;oned him&s;elf. He wrote The Introduc|tion to knowledge, partly in ver&s;e and partly in pro&s;e, and dedicated it to the lady Mary, afterwards queen. There are cuts before every chapter.

Was born at Gouda in 1548, and early pro&s;ecuted his art with great
ardour, under the direction of his uncle, a tolerable painter and a better
&s;cholar. At eighteen he went to Delft, and placed him&s;elf with Antony
Blockland, with whom he remained a year. From thence he travelled
to Fontainbleau, where he worked with great applau&s;e, in competition
with three of his countrymen; but the court coming to Fontainbleau,
they were ordered to leave the palace; Ketel went to Paris and lodged
with John de la Hame, the king's enameller, where he painted &s;ome
hi&s;tories; but an edict obliging the &s;ubjects of the king of Spain to
quit France, Ketel returned to Gouda and remained there &s;ix years.
The troubles in his own country continuing, and con&s;equently little
encouragement being given to the arts, Ketel embarked in 1573 for
England, and was entertained at London by a &s;culptor and architect
there, a friend of his uncle. Here he married a Dutch woman, and
his works growing into e&s;teem, he was much employed by the mer|chants
<PB N="148" REF="174">
in painting portraits, but was &s;eldom engaged on hi&s;tory, to
which his inclination chiefly led him. However, having painted an
allegoric piece of Strength vanqui&s;hed by Wi&s;dom, it was purcha&s;ed
by a young merchant, and pre&s;ented to Sir Chri&s;topher Hatton, after|wards
lord chancellor. This incident introduced Ketel to court; he
drew a good whole length of Sir Chri&s;topher, now at the earl of
Litchfield's at Ditchley; the portrait of Edward Vere earl of Oxford,
of William Herbert earl of Pembroke; of the lord admiral Lincoln,
now at Woburn, and of Henry Fitzalan earl of Arundel; and of &s;e|veral
others. At la&s;t, in 1578, he had the honour of painting the
queen her&s;elf, at the reque&s;t of the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This I &s;uppo&s;e was Frances Howard, &s;econd wife of the earl, and &s;i&s;ter of the lord admiral Nottingham, a favorite.

<P>Ketel left England in 1581, and &s;ettled at Am&s;terdam, where he
painted a large picture of the trained bands with their portraits, and
their captain Herman Rodenburgh Beths at their head. In this pic|ture
too he introduced his own portrait. The di&s;po&s;ition, re&s;emblances,
and the different &s;tuffs of the habits, well imitated, were much admi|red
in this piece. It was placed in the gallery of the Mall at Am&s;ter|dam.
In 1589 he undertook another picture of the &s;ame &s;ort for the
company of St. Seba&s;tian, in which was the portrait of their captain
Didier Ro&s;encraus. It was reckoned not inferior to the former, and
<PB N="149" REF="175">
was neither confu&s;ed nor unanimated, notwith&s;tanding the number of
portraits it contained.</P>
<P>In another of his works, under the figures of Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles,
he repre&s;ented Henry Key&s;er an architect of Am&s;terdam, and the prin|cipal
virtuo&s;os of that city. His be&s;t picture was the portrait of Si|mon
Lack of that city; it was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the &s;ame fa|mily
at the Hague. Many of his works were carried to Dantzick.</P>
<P>In the duke of Buckingham's collection was a large picture by this
ma&s;ter, repre&s;enting the Virtues and Vices. See his catal. p. 19.</P>
<P>But Ketel, not content with the glory he acquired by the&s;e perfor|mances,
in&s;tead of aiming at greater perfection, took it into his head to
make him&s;elf known by a method of painting entirely new. He laid
a&s;ide his bru&s;hes, and painted only with his fingers,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;camps mentions a fine picture painted by Weeninx in the &s;ame manner. Vol. ii. p. 310.

own portrait. The whim took; he repeated the practice, and they
pretend, executed tho&s;e fanta&s;tic works with great purity and beauty
of colouring. In this manner he painted two heads for the Sieur Van
Os of Am&s;terdam; the fir&s;t, a Democritus, was his own portrait; the
other, of M. Moro&s;ini, in the character of Heraclitus. The duc de
Nemours, who was a performer him&s;elf, was charmed with the latter
and bought it. Another, was the picture of Vincent Jacob&s;on, a
noted Wine-merchant of Am&s;terdam, with a gla&s;s of reni&s;h in his
hand. As his &s;ucce&s;s increa&s;ed, &s;o did his folly; his fingers appeared
too ea&s;y tools; he undertook to paint with his feet, and his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay
he pretended to make in public on a picture of the God of Silence. That
public, who began to think like Ketel, that the more a painter was a
<PB N="150" REF="176">
mountebank, the greater was his merit, were &s;o good as to applaud
even this caprice.</P>
<P>Ketel, like De Heere, was a poet too, and wrote de&s;criptions of &s;eve|ral
of his own works in ver&s;e. He under&s;tood architecture, geometry
and per&s;pective, and modelled in clay and wax. He was living in 1600,
when Vermander wrote his account of him. Sandrart who makes him
travel to Venice and Rome, and die young, while he was employed on
a picture of the king of Denmark, has confounded the ma&s;ter with the
&s;cholar; the latter incidents relate to I&s;aac Oteryn of Copenhaguen,
Ketel's only di&s;ciple.</P>
<P>Vermander dedicated to Ketel a di&s;&s;ertation on the &s;tatues of the an|cients,
in which he mentions the great friend&s;hip that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween
them for thirty years.</P>
<P>Vertue ob&s;erved on the works of De Heere and Ketel, that tho&s;e of
the former are generally &s;maller than the life, neater, not &s;o &s;trongly
coloured, and mo&s;t commonly painted on board. Tho&s;e of Ketel, more
&s;trongly coloured and with a fuller pencil, and always as large or rather
larger than nature.</P>

The younger brother of Taddeo, and born like him, at Vado in the
duchy of Urbino, in the year 1550. Frederic was carried by his pa|rents
to Rome, where their elder &s;on was then employed: the younger

a&s;&s;i&s;tance he painted a picture of Helicon and the Mu&s;es for a Roman
nobleman; and executed greate&s;t part of a chapel in which his brother
was engaged. They worked for &s;ome time in concert; and being at
Florence painted in four days the whole hi&s;tory of the Pa&s;&s;ion which
was be&s;poken in a hurry for the decoration of a church on Ea&s;ter &s;un|day.
Taddeo dying at the age of thirty-&s;even, Frederic fini&s;hed his
imperfect works, among which were the paintings at the magnificent
palace then lately built at Caprarola by cardinal Farne&s;e. His picture
in di&s;temper of Calumny, borrowed from the de&s;cription of one paint|ed
by Apelles, was &s;uppo&s;ed a tacit &s;atire on that cardinal, with whom
he had quarrelled on &s;ome deficience of payment. Zucchero's temper

re&s;entment; while he was employed by Gregory XIII. to paint the Pau|line
chapel in the vatican, he fell out with &s;ome of his holine&s;s's officers.
To be revenged, he painted their portraits with ears of a&s;&s;es, and expo|&s;ed
the picture publicly over the gate of St. Luke's church, on the fe&s;ti|val

&s;tocked him&s;elf with a quantity, again &s;et out for Spain, where he pro|po&s;ed
to &s;ell them, but was ca&s;t away on a &s;mall i&s;land near the coa&s;t of
Portugal. He and &s;ome of the crew were relieved by monks that lived
among the rocks, and conducted to Li&s;bon, where relating the danger
he had e&s;caped, a paltry painter there engaged Vroom to draw the
&s;torm he de&s;cribed, in which he &s;ucceeded &s;o happily, that it was &s;old
to a nobleman for a con&s;iderable price. The Portugue&s;e painter was
charmed, and continued to employ Vroom, who improved &s;o much in
&s;ea-pieces, that having got money, and returning home, he applied
him&s;elf entirely to that &s;tyle of painting.</P>
<P>At this period, the great earl of Nottingham, lord high admiral
of England, who&s;e defeat of the Spani&s;h Armada had e&s;tabli&s;hed the
throne of his mi&s;tre&s;s, being de&s;irous of pre&s;erving the detail of that il|lu&s;trious
event, had be&s;poken a &s;uit of tape&s;try de&s;cribing the particu|lars
of each day's engagement. Francis Spiering, an eminent maker
of tape&s;try, undertook the work, and engaged Vroom to draw the de|&s;igns.
The excellence of the performance, obvious to the public eye,
makes encomiums unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is plea&s;ingly remarkable that there are two monuments of this
&s;ort, and both finely executed, the tape&s;try in que&s;tion and the &s;uit at
Blenheim, monuments of two &s;ignal victories, acquired by &s;ea and
land, under the au&s;pices of two queens of the &s;ame country, and both
gained in defence of the liberties of nations, attacked by two of the
mo&s;t powerfull princes, Philip II. and Louis XIV.</P>
<P>Vroom received an hundred pieces of gold for his labour: The arras
it&s;elf containing 708 ells Flemi&s;h, at 10<HI>l. 1s.</HI> per ell, co&s;t 1628<HI>l.</HI> which

<P>The painter came to England to receive in&s;tructions and execute
his commi&s;&s;ion; and contracting a friend&s;hip with I&s;aac Oliver was
drawn by him: There is a print from that picture.</P>
<P>He returned to his own country, and painted a large picture, which
was much admired by prince Maurice, of the &s;eventh day's action of
the fight above-mentioned. Vroom died rich, in what year is not
mentioned.</P>
<P>In the collection of king James II. were two &s;ea-pieces, and in that
of Sir Peter Lely, a land&s;cape, both de&s;cribed to be of old Vroom,
whence I &s;uppo&s;e he had a &s;on who followed his profe&s;&s;ion, and his
&s;tyle too, as in the former catalogue is mentioned a &s;ea-piece with king
Charles coming from Spain, &s;aid to be by Vroom, without the adjunct

<Q>NICHOLAS HILLIARD</Q>
Limner, jeweller and gold&s;mith to queen Elizabeth and afterwards to
king James, was &s;on of Richard Hilliard of Exeter, high &s;heriff of
that city and county in the year 1560. Nicholas (I &s;uppo&s;e a younger
&s;on) was born in 1547, and brought up to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a jeweller
and gold&s;mith, to which his inclination &s;oon added that of painting in
miniature. The want of an able in&s;tructor directed him to &s;tudy the
works of Holbein, as he &s;ays in a MS. I &s;hall mention; &startq;Holbein's
manner of limning I have ever imitated and hold it for the be&s;t.&endq; But
though Hilliard copied the neatne&s;s of his model, he was far from at|taining
that nature and force which that great ma&s;ter impre&s;&s;ed on his
mo&s;t minute works. Hilliard arrived at no &s;trength of colouring; his
faces are pale, and void of any variety of tints, the features, jewels
and ornaments expre&s;&s;ed by lines as &s;lender as a hair. The exact dre&s;s
of the times he curiou&s;ly delineated; but he &s;eldom attempted beyond
a head, yet his performances were greatly valued; Dr. Donne in his
poem on the &s;torm in which the earl of E&s;&s;ex was &s;urprized returning
from the i&s;land voyage, &s;ays,

Hilliard continued in vogue during this reign, and great numbers of
portraits by his hand, e&s;pecially of ladies, are extant. He obtained
&s;till greater favour from king James, drawing his maje&s;ty's and prince
Henry's pictures; and receiving a patent, printed by Rymer, to this
effect,</P>
<P>Whereas our well-beloved &s;ervant Nicholas Hilliard, gentleman,
our principal drawer of &s;mall portraits, and embo&s;&s;er of our medals in
gold, in re&s;pect of his extraordinary &s;kill in drawing, graving, and

twelve years, to invent, make, grave and imprint any pictures of our
image or our royal family, &amp;c. and that no one do pre&s;ume to do,

<P>This grant was of great emolument to him, as about that time he
engraved many &s;mall plates and &s;old licences for others, with the heads

But Hondius, Sandrart, and all the writers who mention him, call him an Engli&s;h|man, and it is an additional confirmation of his Engli&s;h birth, that he wrote in that language a treati&s;e on limning, partly printed in Sander&s;on's Graphice; in his pocket-book was a mixture of French and Engli&s;h.</NOTE></Q>
