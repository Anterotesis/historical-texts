<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOEL, Chap. II. Ver. 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Turn ye even to me with all your Heart, with Fa&s;ting, and with Weeping, and with Mourning.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT Time this Prophet liv'd in, and what Sin, and remarkable Events, his Prophecy was con|cern'd in (&s;ince he has no-where expre&s;ly told us), Interpreters have been divided in their Opinions: Nor &s;hall I &s;pend your Time, in reconciling their different Judg|ments.</P>
<P>This is certain, that the State and Con|dition of tho&s;e Times was extremely &s;ad, and deplorably calamitous, as is plain from tho&s;e full De&s;criptions in the Fir&s;t Chapter.</P>
<P>It is evident likewi&s;e, that the <HI>Jews</HI> ex|pected more dreadful and trouble&s;ome Days from a foreign Inva&s;ion, which was break|ing in upon them, as is here de&s;cribed, with
<PB N="2" REF="5">all tho&s;e Horrors that can either appall or terrify; is painted in the mo&s;t tragical Co|lours, and with &s;uch a kind of Oratory, and &s;uch Strains, as the Prophets u&s;ed of old; when with high and lofty Hyper|boles they would foretel the utter Ruin of a People.</P>
<P>Thus, Ver&s;e 10. <HI>The Earth &s;hall quake before them, and the Heavens &s;hall tremble; the Sun and the Moon &s;hall be dark, and the Stars &s;hall withdraw their Shining.</HI></P>
<P>And, le&s;t the very Thoughts of this hor|rible Confu&s;ion, le&s;t the Apprehen&s;ions of &s;uch amazing Danger, le&s;t the Nearne&s;s of its Approach, &s;hould overwhelm their Spirits, and make them langui&s;h, faint, and die into De&s;pair; God does by the Pro|phet &s;hew them, how they might appea&s;e his Anger, and &s;tay his flaming Sword from the &s;peedy Execution of Vengeance: And the Directions are laid down in the Words of the Text.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore al&s;o now, &s;aith the Lord, Turn ye even to me with all your Heart, and with Fa&s;ting, Weeping, and Mourning.</HI></P>
<P>Which Words I &s;hall fully explain; and then deduce &s;ome practical Inferences from them.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall inquire, What it is to turn unto God.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<P>Now, fir&s;t, in the &s;acred and prophetic Style, tho&s;e may be &s;aid to turn unto God, who, after they had revolted from him, and became Idolaters, were &s;en&s;ible of their Er|ror, and returned to the true God.</P>
<P>Or, at lea&s;t, tho&s;e may be &s;aid to turn unto him, who, having from their very In|fancy taken in the Super&s;titions of their Fathers, together with their Education, and been nouri&s;hed and brought up under &s;uch Prejudices, as have been confirmed by Cu&s;tom, and gathered Strength with Age, &s;hall yet, upon wi&s;e and ju&s;t Motives, change this unrea&s;onable Religion, for one that is recommended by more &s;ober Arguments than a bare Education can pretend to: And this, in the ordinary and common Expre&s;|&s;ion, is call'd Conver&s;ion, or the Turning of a Man's Religion.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e that have a &s;ound and an orthodox Faith in God; tho&s;e that honour God with all the po&s;&s;ible Te&s;timonies of an inward and an outward Reverence; tho&s;e that draw nigh unto him with a Love full of Awe, but without &s;lavi&s;h Fear; tho&s;e that receive him into their Hearts and Souls, by delighting to meditate upon his Nature, and obey his Commands;</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;aid, in Scripture-Phra&s;e, to cleave fa&s;t to God; to be (as it were) clo&s;e|ly united to the Divine Nature; to draw
<PB N="4" REF="7">nigh unto God; to be one with him; to be his peculiar People; to be his adopted Sons.</P>
<P>And, on the other hand, tho&s;e that for|&s;ake the true Religion, and embrace &s;uper|&s;titious and idolatrous Rites, are &s;aid to for&s;ake their God; to deny him; to reject him; to commit &s;piritual Whoredom; to turn their Backs upon him.</P>
<P>This then is the fir&s;t Notion of turning unto God; namely, the quitting of Ido|latry and Super&s;tition, and owning and wor&s;hipping the true God.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Tho&s;e may be &s;aid to turn unto God, that are changed from Wicked|ne&s;s to Piety; from Inju&s;tice, to Righteou&s;|ne&s;s; from a refractory &s;tubborn Temper, to a yielding and obedient Di&s;po&s;ition; from impure and filthy Manners, to cha&s;te and clean Habits.</P>
<P>The&s;e are call'd the Friends of God: And this Turning does imply Repentance; an intire Change of Life and Manners: And the Scripture does in &s;everal Places prove our Obedience to God's Commands to be the certain nece&s;&s;ary Fruits of our being turned unto God.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxx. 2. Returning unto the Lord is explained by obeying his Voice: And in the lvth of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> Ver&s;e 7. <HI>Let the Wicked for&s;ake his Way, and the unrighteous
<PB N="5" REF="8">Man his Thoughts and let him return unto the Lord:</HI> And in the xiith of <HI>Ho&s;ea,</HI> Ver. 6. <HI>Therefore turn thou to thy God: Keep Mercy and Judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Tho&s;e may be &s;aid to turn to the Lord, that are inwardly touched with a deep Sen&s;e of their own Vilene&s;s; and publicly expre&s;s it by &s;ome vi&s;ible Signs.</P>
<P>Thus, when the <HI>Ninevites</HI> fa&s;ted, and &s;at in Sackcloth and A&s;hes, <HI>Jonah</HI> iii. ver. 10. God &s;aw their Works, that <HI>they turned from their evil Way.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Daniel</HI> tells us of him&s;elf, <HI>Daniel</HI> ix. ver. 3. <HI>I &s;et my Face unto the Lord God, to &s;eek by Prayer, and Supplications, with Fa&s;ting, and Sackcloth, and A&s;hes.</HI></P>
<P>Without Controver&s;y; as the Prophet chiefly intended, that Men &s;hould turn to God, in the Two former Sen&s;es; as he would have tho&s;e be fir&s;t in the Inten|tion; &s;o this la&s;t &s;hould be the fir&s;t in Exe|cution; as being a public Te&s;timony of a Mind di&s;po&s;ed to a &s;incere Repentance.</P>
<P>For it is evident from the Sacred Hi|&s;tory, that the <HI>Jews</HI> in that Age had re|volted from the Religion which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had pre&s;cribed them; and were fondly imitating the &s;uper&s;titious Practices of the Heathens.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<P>They were plea&s;ed with the Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> how vile and ba&s;e &s;oever: They affected their cruel and bloody Sa|crifices, their fooli&s;h and ob&s;cene Rites; and, out of a wild Zeal, they became con|formable to their wretched Manners; which were &s;o much below the Dignity of the human Nature, that the Devil &s;eemed on Purpo&s;e to have invented them, to betray unwary Souls: For it is the highe&s;t Luxury of Hell, at once to abu&s;e and en&s;lave, and then to &s;corn and deride Mankind.</P>
<P>In the mean time, that Law which was delivered by Angels, that Law which God him&s;elf gave the People from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> was neglected and di&s;u&s;ed, and al|mo&s;t quite forgot; whil&s;t there was a Plague of Darkne&s;s, thicker than that of <HI>Egypt;</HI> a black impenetrable Cloud covered all the People: They were gro&s;ly ignorant: They were in&s;olently haughty: The delicate Softne&s;s of the Effeminate; the Profu&s;e|ne&s;s of the Luxurious; the In&s;atiablene&s;s of the Covetous; and, the natural Offspring of the&s;e Vices, outrageous Cruelty; the heavie&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion; the mo&s;t execrable Perfi|diou&s;ne&s;s; all Kinds and Degrees of Wicked|ne&s;s; made up the Character of the Nation.</P>
<P>And the&s;e Sins cry'd aloud for Ven|geance; forged the Thunderbolts; and
<PB N="7" REF="10">compelled the God of Recompence to his <HI>&s;trange Work,</HI> as the Prophet &s;tyles the Execution of his Judgments.</P>
<P>And Woe be to the Inhabitants of the Earth, when God is angry! Who can wre&s;tle with the Almighty, or &s;tand in Oppo&s;ition to the Great God? The whole World is but as Stubble, before this con&s;uming Fire: The Day of the Lord is great, and very terrible; and who can abide it?</P>
<P>Therefore al&s;o now, &s;aith the Lord, <HI>Turn ye unto me, if you would prevent the&s;e Judgments; change your wicked Cu&s;toms; amend your Lives; and, as ye have pub|licly imitated the Ceremonies of the</HI> Hea|then, <HI>&s;o give &s;ome public Te&s;timony of your Sorrow: Turn ye unto me with all your Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>And this Conver&s;ion mu&s;t be attended with Fa&s;ting, Weeping, and Mourning: Which needs no laborious Explanation.</P>
<P>By Fa&s;ting, nothing le&s;s is meant, than a Religious Ab&s;tinence, for &s;ome time, from the Kinds and Quantity of our Diet.</P>
<P>And for this no Rules can exactly be laid down; &s;ince Mens Con&s;titutions are va&s;tly different: Some can fa&s;t with Ea&s;e, others cannot do it: The only &s;ure Me|thod is, to mea&s;ure our Fa&s;t, by its pro|moting
<PB N="8" REF="11">our Devotions; and where it hath that Effect, it is a truly Religious Fa&s;t.</P>
<P>By Weeping and Mourning, Men out|wardly expre&s;s their inward Sentiments to others; either by a natural In&s;tinct, or by the received Cu&s;tom of the World: For, when a dead Weight hangs heavily upon the Soul, it is naturally ea&s;ed by a Shower of Tears.</P>
<P>Now, from the Text thus explained, with reference to the Context, I deduce the&s;e Three general Heads of Practical Di&s;cour&s;e:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That, to appea&s;e God's Indigna|tion, and avert his Judgments, nothing can be more effectual, than a &s;erious Re|pentance, and an hearty (intire) Refor|mation of our Lives and Manners.</P>
<P>And, tho' this might be proved by great Variety of Te&s;timonies and Exam|ples from the Scripture; &s;ince the Pro|phets by their awakening Threatenings, by their loud Complaints, by their warm pathetical Exhortations, had only one main End to carry on; which was either to fright, or per&s;uade and move, Men to Repentance;</P>
<P>Yet I &s;hall wholly pa&s;s by tho&s;e well-known In&s;tances, and endeavour to prove my A&s;&s;ertion, by <HI>Rational Arguments.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<P>The fir&s;t of which &s;hall be taken from the natural Genius and Temper of Man|kind, upon whom any Calamities are in|flicted.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Men are immer&s;ed in vicious Habits; whil&s;t they are Proficients in all the crooked Arts of Vice; whil&s;t they indulge them&s;elves in lewd abominable Cu&s;toms;</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, but that they mu&s;t di&s;|plea&s;e a God of infinite Purity, and pro|voke his Indignation again&s;t them; they are not fit and proper Objects of his heaven|ly Mercy; they are not capable of any Fe|licity. They are in &s;uch a State, that the Divine Indulgence may mightily prejudice, but cannot do them any Kindne&s;s; the Favours of Heaven render them, not only wor&s;e, but more mi&s;erable, and unea&s;y to them&s;elves and others.</P>
<P>The longer they are &s;pared, the more are they confirmed in wicked Cour&s;es: Hence they never &s;pend one Thought about Re|pentance; they &s;eem to have no Sen&s;e of their Guilt; their Hearts are hardened; their Con&s;ciences &s;eared; they are deaf to the Threatnings and Terrors of the Lord; their Impurity heightens their audacious Folly, and they grow ob&s;tinate and intract|able.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="13">
<P>They at once forget both God and them&s;elves; and, becau&s;e Sentence is not &s;peedily executed upon them, therefore their Hearts are &s;et in them, de&s;perately &s;et in them, to do wickedly.</P>
<P>They cea&s;e to take God for their Strength; and then they de&s;pi&s;e him, neg|lect his Threats, and endeavour to di&s;pute his Being out of the World. For it is a natural Step from an habitual Wickedne&s;s to downright Athei&s;m.</P>
<P>For no Man ever yet denied a God, but his own Guilt made him fir&s;t wi&s;h, there was none to puni&s;h him.</P>
<P>Now, before Men have quitted their be|loved Vices, before they are re&s;olved to change their Lives, and grow virtuous; is it fit, that either the Judgments, that Men feel, &s;hould be removed; or that God &s;hould extend his Loving-kindne&s;s to them?</P>
<P>But when they are a&s;hamed of their Folly, and begin to be wi&s;e, then are they capable of Mercy; then will they gratefully ac|knowledge and receive the Favours of Hea|ven; and know how to u&s;e their good Fortunes reverently.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> My next Argument &s;hall be taken from the Nature and Intention of temporal Puni&s;hments.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="14">
<P>For the&s;e are de&s;igned to amend what is ami&s;s; and the Fury of God's Anger hath a Mixture of Love: He does cor|rect us in Mercy, and cha&s;ti&s;e us like a Father.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;ic may be bitter and ungrate|ful; but it is to re&s;tore the Patient to his Health: The Cau&s;tic and Saw may look like In&s;truments of Cruelty; but milder Pre&s;criptions would &s;pread the Gangrene, and Lenitives prove fatal to the Man.</P>
<P>Afflictions are the true Purgatory of the Soul; they con&s;ume the Dro&s;s, and refine the whole Ma&s;s, and make it at once both pure and bright; they qualify us for Heaven.</P>
<P>And is it not nece&s;&s;ary, that they &s;hould be laid upon us, till they had ac|compli&s;h'd the Ends for which they were &s;ent? Would it not be rather Cruelty than Mercy to us, to remove them before they had had their ju&s;t Operation?</P>
<P>But, having done this Work, and re|formed the Man, they are of no further U&s;e: They that are whole, need not a Phy|&s;ician; and Afflictions come not to call <HI>the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> My la&s;t Argument &s;hall be taken from the Nature of God him&s;elf, who mortally hates Sin.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="15">
<P>And the di&s;tant Poles may as &s;oon unite, Heaven and Hell may as &s;oon meet each other, as God be reconciled to a wicked impenitent Wretch, whil&s;t he ob&s;tinately continues &s;o.</P>
<P>Now Almighty God knows, what Mi|&s;ery and Trouble the&s;e carele&s;s Sinners ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to; and he pities tho&s;e that have no Compa&s;&s;ion for their own immor|tal Souls.</P>
<P>But yet he expre&s;&s;es his Tenderne&s;s in a Way agreeable to his Nature; by his Ex|hortations and Threatnings: And, when he puni&s;hes, he &s;trikes with Reluctancy: and &s;eems to have inward Strivings: <HI>How &s;hall I give thee up,</HI> Ephraim? <HI>My Heart is turned within me, my Repentings are kindled.</HI></P>
<P>Turn unto the Lord your God; for he is merciful and gracious: He loves the Man, whil&s;t he plagues the Sinner; and would not that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved.</P>
<P>From all which it is clear, that if we would have the Almighty lay a&s;ide his Di&s;|plea&s;ure; if we would have him be merci|ful and gracious; if we would not have him manife&s;t him&s;elf in devouring Flames; <HI>we &s;hould turn unto him.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="16">
<P>And we may humbly hope, that he will dart the chearful Rays of his &s;erener Glories upon us, <HI>that he will lift up the Light of his Countenance upon us,</HI> and deliver us from tho&s;e Evils which we may either fear, or labour under: For the only Expedient to appea&s;e his Anger, and be delivered from his Judgments, is, to turn unto him with all our Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From the &s;econd Explanation of turning unto God, which implies Re|pentance, I cannot but infer, that a broken and a contrite Heart is the ready Way to avert God's Di&s;plea&s;ure; which may be evinc'd by the Rea&s;on of the Thing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Who is there, that, having found out the Plague of his own Heart; having been abundantly con&s;cious of his wicked Life; what Happine&s;s he has lo&s;t; what Mi&s;ery he has madly plunged him&s;elf into;</P>
<P>Who is there, that con&s;iders how im|piou&s;ly, and unju&s;tly, and ungratefully, he has behaved him&s;elf towards that gracious God, in whom he lives and moves, and has his Being?</P>
<P>Who is there that &s;eriou&s;ly reflects upon that Goodne&s;s which he hath abu&s;ed, and upon that Power which he hath provoked?</P>
<P>Who is there that can deliberately me|ditate upon his own Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; his
<PB N="14" REF="17">heinous Iniquities; his intolerable Provo|cations; and not be heartily angry and troubled, that he &s;hould ever be &s;o vile and di&s;engenuous?</P>
<P>And this Sorrow will not fail to work <HI>Repentance to Salvation, not to be repented of.</HI></P>
<P>For no Man can be plea&s;ed with the&s;e Severities for their own &s;akes; no Man can delight in condemning him&s;elf; were it not in order to the rai&s;ing &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion in him&s;elf again&s;t his Sins, as &s;hould &s;ettle and &s;ix into a deep Hatred of his pa&s;t notorious Violations of his Duty: And that will produce a &s;olicitous Care to avoid them for the Time to come</P>
<P>For who, that had e&s;caped a Shipwreck would not indu&s;triou&s;ly avoid the Rocks and Sands? Who, that had felt the Scorch|ings of the Flames, would not cautiou&s;ly dread a &s;econd Burning? And why &s;hould not he, that has felt the Whips and La&s;hes, the Stings and Goads, the Pangs and Throes, of an enraged Con&s;cience, be as anxiou&s;ly careful to e&s;cape its Fury; &s;ince Almighty God has declared that he is plea&s;ed with the Humble and the Contrite? He hath pro|mi&s;ed, the Mourners &s;hall be comforted: He hath his Ble&s;&s;ings for the Poor in Spi|rit; is ready to forgive tho&s;e that with un|feigned Sorrow turn to him.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="18">
<P>He hath Balm to pour into the Wounds of a langui&s;hing Soul; he hath a Pardon ready to be &s;ealed in his Son's Blood, for tho&s;e that have been in Agonies for their Guilt; and are able, with an humble Great|ne&s;s of Mind, to fill up that which is be|hind of the Sufferings of Chri&s;t, <HI>Colo&s;&s;i|ans</HI> i. Ver. 24.</P>
<P>He hath Refre&s;hment, he hath Re&s;t, for all that are weary and heavy-laden; for tho&s;e that &s;toop down with Sorrow, and inflict a &s;evere Penance upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then, that, as ever we de&s;ire to have God be merciful to us, we mu&s;t qualify our&s;elves for his Compa&s;&s;ion, by repenting of our Sins, by turning unto him with a &s;orrowful Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> From the la&s;t Notion of turning to God, which implies our expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome outward Signs of Trouble for our Sins, it may be inferred, That the Favour of God may be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, obtain'd by &s;uch a Behaviour; becau&s;e he doth frequently injoin it.</P>
<P><HI>See&s;t thou how</HI> Ahab <HI>humbleth him&s;elf? Becau&s;e he humbleth him&s;elf, I will not bring the Evil in his Days.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ninevites</HI> keep a &s;trict Fa&s;t, and for that Rea&s;on their great City is &s;pared: <HI>We fa&s;ted, and be&s;ought our God, for this;
<PB N="16" REF="19">and he was intreated of us,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Ezra</HI> viii. 23.</P>
<P>It is not for nothing, that the&s;e out|ward Shews of Sorrow are called Repent|ance in the holy Writ; for God is glori|fied by the&s;e Au&s;terities: They become the Condition and State of every true Peni|tent; they tend to the Edification of our Brethren; they promote, and increa&s;e, and &s;trengthen our Repentance; they are the Pledges, and the hopeful Beginnings of a thorough Reformation.</P>
<P>Now, of the&s;e, Fa&s;ting is one: And be|cau&s;e <HI>this pre&s;ent Solemnity,</HI> and the Na|ture of the Duty, &s;eem to require it; and becau&s;e it may be mi&s;taken (whil&s;t &s;ome may be too &s;evere, and others too remi&s;s); I &s;hall more largely treat of it.</P>
<P>I do not find, in the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> any expre&s;s Rules about the Ob&s;ervation of Fa&s;ts, nor any one particular Time recom|mended for that religious Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Only, in the Laws about the Fea&s;t of Expiation, they are injoined to afflict their Soul by a Statute for ever, <HI>Lev.</HI> xvi. 31. And that, in the Original, &s;ignifies Fa&s;t|ing.</P>
<P>But that they did in&s;titute both ordinary and extraordinary Fa&s;ts (though they had no po&s;itive Revelation about it), is plain
<PB N="17" REF="20">from the viiith Chapter of <HI>Zechariah,</HI> Ver. 19. where you hear of the Fa&s;t of the Fourth Month, and the Fa&s;t of the Fifth Month, and the Fa&s;t of the Seventh, and the Fa&s;t of the Tenth Month.</P>
<P>The Occa&s;ion of the&s;e Fa&s;ts was to pre|&s;erve a yearly Remembrance of the Tables of the Law, that were broken; of the Siege of their Imperial City <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> of the Temple, that was burnt to the Ground; and of the treacherous Murder of <HI>Gedaliah,</HI> who was barbarou&s;ly &s;lain by <HI>I&s;hmael, Je|remiah</HI> xli. Ver. 2.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the common ordinary Fa&s;ts that were ob&s;erved of old; and to this Day are ob&s;erved by the modern <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, they had their extraordi|nary ones; &s;uch were tho&s;e of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> when the <HI>Benjamites</HI> had &s;lain &s;o many of them in Battle, <HI>Judges</HI> xx. 26. They wept, and &s;at before the Lord, and fa&s;ted that Day until Even. Such was that of King <HI>Jeho&s;haphat,</HI> when he dreaded the Incur|&s;ions of the <HI>Moabites</HI> and the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xx. 3. <HI>He feared, and &s;et him&s;elf to &s;eek the Lord; and he proclaimed a Fa&s;t throughout</HI> Judah.</P>
<P>Such likewi&s;e was that of <HI>Ezra,</HI> when he was about the great Work of Reforma|tion; when he was to rebuild a Temple,
<PB N="18" REF="21">to e&s;tabli&s;h the Wor&s;hip of God, and rai&s;e a City from its Ruins.</P>
<P>That private Men did for pious Rea&s;ons oblige them&s;elves to fa&s;t, is clear from the Examples of <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah;</HI> and tho&s;e among&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> that were look'd upon to be more devout than the Genera|lity of the People, religiou&s;ly fa&s;ted every <HI>Monday</HI> and <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> throughout the whole Year.</P>
<P>From whence it is highly probable, that the Cu&s;tom of Fa&s;ting twice a Week (every <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI>) among&s;t the primitive Chri&s;tians took its Original: And this is almo&s;t as antient as the Apo&s;tles Days.</P>
<P>It is mentioned, as what was well known in <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Time, who was the fir&s;t of all the <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers; and 'tis in&s;i&s;ted on by <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if you plea&s;e to con&s;ider the Ends and Advantages of Fa&s;ting: Fir&s;t, This doth naturally afflict and humble the Soul: Hence the Royal <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> confe&s;&s;es of him|&s;elf, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xxxv. 13. <HI>As for me, my Clothing was Sackloth, I humbled my Soul with Fa&s;ting.</HI> But, as a late Divine very happily expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf upon this Occa&s;ion, "Indeed (&s;ays he) <Q>the Soul that dwells in Di&s;hes,
<PB N="19" REF="22">&startq;and is &s;tewed in its own Luxuries, grows loo&s;e, and doth di&s;&s;olve; all its Firmne&s;s for&s;akes it; the Man is &s;trong for nothing but for Lu&s;ts; his Faculties are choaked and &s;tifled; they &s;tagnate, &endq;and are mired within him.</Q> (Dr. <HI>Ale|&s;tree</HI>). And it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>For let a Man re&s;olve to be never &s;o virtuous, yet, except he doth as well pro|&s;ecute the Means, as re&s;olve upon the End, he &s;hall never reach his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>For whil&s;t I furni&s;h my Table with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Varieties; whil&s;t I &s;train my Invention, to care&s;s my Appetite; I am &s;o far from &s;triving again&s;t, that I am dieting my&s;elf for, the mo&s;t dangerous Temptations.</P>
<P>But Fa&s;ting &s;ubdues the outrageous Pa&s;|&s;ions, [puts a Bit and Bridle upon the Bea&s;t within us]; &s;catters all the gro&s;s Fumes that cloud the Under&s;tanding; and doth at once both clear the Head, and fill it with lower Thoughts of our&s;elves: It enables us to &s;ee our own Unworthine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> This prepares us for &s;piritual Food, and qualifies the Soul for the Plea|&s;ures that are at God's Right Hand: It breaks a&s;under tho&s;e Bonds that tied and fettered us to this lower &s;en&s;ual World:
<PB N="20" REF="23">It &s;ets the Soul at Liberty, and wings it (as it were) for Heaven, by removing tho&s;e dull Weights, that every Act of In|temperance lays upon us.</P>
<P>But yet, to prevent Mi&s;takes, an intire Fa&s;t does not do this: For Nature mu&s;t have its Nece&s;&s;aries; and, whil&s;t we deny it Superfluities, we mu&s;t not pretend to be more than Men.</P>
<P>For, how often do we find our&s;elves mi&s;taken; when we would therefore fa&s;t, that we might be more devout? Whil&s;t Nature importunately recoils upon us; And, if we are ob&s;tinate in denying her, we may perhaps rai&s;e &s;trong hypochondria|cal Vapours; we may &s;well with Empti|ne&s;s, but &s;hall be unfit for any Acts of Devotion.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be temperate at all times; but, upon this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, we &s;hould revenge the Jollities, and Fe&s;tivals, of the pa&s;t Year, by Mortifications, and Self-denials; but &s;till with &s;uch a Regard to our Con&s;titutions, that we &s;poil not the good Work by overdoing it.</P>
<P>That Fa&s;t, and that alone, is acceptable to God, which &s;trengthens the Soul, and makes it more active and vigorous in its Devotions.</P>
<P>For, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Our Fa&s;ts have a mighty In|fluence
<PB N="21" REF="24">upon our Prayers; whil&s;t they with|draw our Minds from &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures: For &s;uch is the nimble de&s;ultory Motion of the Fancy, &s;o quick is the Imagination, that, even when we would be &s;erious, we are roving upon the little Vanities of a plea&s;ant Con|ver&s;ation: We are ready to entertain our Thoughts with &s;omething that happened to our&s;elves, or the Company: And the&s;e <HI>Fowls</HI> (like tho&s;e upon <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Car|ca&s;es) light down upon, and interrupt our Devotions; with this fatal Difference, that he drove them away, <HI>Gen.</HI> xv. 11. whereas they prey upon us, and feed upon our Hearts.</P>
<P>Prayer and Fa&s;ting are the Heaven|born Twins of pure Religion, and con|&s;titute the Character of the truly Devout.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid of <HI>Anna</HI> the Prophete&s;s, <HI>that &s;he departed not from the Temple, but &s;erved God with Fa&s;ting and Prayers, Night and Day, St.</HI> Luke ii. 37.</P>
<P>The devout <HI>Cornelius</HI> tells us, <HI>that he was fa&s;ting until the Ninth Hour, and pray|ing in his Hou&s;e;</HI> that is, he fa&s;ted till our Three of the Clock in the Afternoon; for that was their Ninth Hour: And then it was, <HI>that a Man &s;tood before him in bright Clothing,</HI> Acts x. 30.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="25">
<P>An Angel, clad in the &s;hining Robes of Glory, de&s;cended and appeared with a Lu&s;tre round about him.</P>
<P>The Beams were awful, but &s;till kind; and the Love of Heaven was &s;hed upon him, in tho&s;e chearful Rays.</P>
<P>The Fa&s;ts, that were kept before Sacred Orders were conferred in the Church, are as old as Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, <HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 23.</P>
<P>They prayed with Fa&s;ting, when they or|dained Elders in every Church; and com|mended them to the Lord:</P>
<P>As being well a&s;&s;ured, that their Fa&s;ts had a mighty Efficacy upon their Prayers: That the Flame of their Devotion was bright and clear, and a&s;pired with re&s;tle&s;s Ardors to the Throne of Grace; whil&s;t the Spirits were re|fined, and the earthy Mixture &s;eparated by Fa&s;ting; and the Men &s;eemed no longer to have any human Thoughts about them.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Our Fa&s;ts are the Cau&s;es of many admirable Graces, which meet all together, like a glorious Con&s;tellation, in tho&s;e that are thus ab&s;temious.</P>
<P>They convince us of our Infirmities, and fill us with Compa&s;&s;ion, towards our Brethren: For then do my Bowels earn after tho&s;e that want, when, by this holy Di&s;cipline, I have cha&s;ti&s;ed my&s;elf.</P>
<P>They that live &s;oftly and delicately, that &s;tretch them&s;elves upon their Beds of Ivory, and invent to them&s;elves In&s;truments of Mu&s;ic, that frolick it in all Exce&s;s, are never grieved for the Afflictions of <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI></P>
<PB N="23" REF="26">
<P>But he that truly fa&s;ts, gives Alms; he deals his Bread to the Hungry, covers the Naked with a Garment; he hath a deep Sen&s;e of other Mens Calamities, and hides not him|&s;elf from his own Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>And this is &s;uch a Fa&s;t, as God hath cho&s;en; it is &s;ure to find Recompence; for, <HI>Then &s;hall thy Light break forth, as the Morning; and thy Health &s;hall &s;pring forth &s;peedily: Thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall go before thee, and the Glory of the Lord, &s;hall be thy Reward.</HI> I&s;aiah lviii. Ver. 8.</P>
<P><HI>Then &s;hall thy Light ri&s;e in Ob&s;curity, and thy Darkne&s;s be as the Noon-day.</HI> And Ver. 11. <HI>The Lord &s;hall guide the continually, and &s;atisfy thy Soul in Drought, and make fat thy Bones: And thou &s;halt be like a watered Garden, and like a Spring who&s;e Waters fail not.</HI></P>
<P>The Performance of this Duty gives us Peace and Serenity of Spirit; our State and Condition in this Life requires it; the Tempta|tions to which we are expo&s;ed, are avoided by it.</P>
<P>And we have the Plea&s;ure of imitating the Worthies of old; &s;uch as <HI>Mo&s;es, Daniel,</HI> and <HI>Elias;</HI> and of obeying the Command, and conforming to the Example, of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour.</P>
<P>And every good Chri&s;tian will, with St. <HI>Paul, keep under his Body, have it in Subjection: For they that are Chri&s;t's, have crucified the Fle&s;h, with its Affections and Lu&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>And then it is as &s;ure, that tho&s;e are none of Chri&s;t's, who have not crucified the Fle&s;h.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="27">
<P>Nor can they have any comfortable Hope, that they &s;hall one Day be owned by him, that could not, for his &s;ake, fa&s;t &s;ometimes, who for theirs led a Life of Mortifications, was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief.</P>
<P>It is true, that he &s;ometimes went to Fe&s;ti|vals: But, even there, he was exactly tempe|rate; and taught us to u&s;e this World, as not abu&s;ing it; and left his great Example for our Imitation.</P>
<P>It would be arrogant Profanene&s;s in us to pretend to be able to imitate him in his Forty Days Fa&s;t; for that was the Effect of his Power, and as true a Miracle as any that he wrought.</P>
<P>But yet, &s;o far as our Natures will allow us, we &s;hould be temperate in our Meats and Drinks; and, if we re&s;olve never to deny our|&s;elves, our Sentence is read in tho&s;e terrible Words of St. <HI>Paul, Romans</HI> viii. 6.</P>
<P><HI>To be carnally minded is Death;</HI> that is, To indulge our bruti&s;h Sen&s;uality, to mind and &s;tudy the Fle&s;h, will dreadfully expo&s;e us to eternal Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>We &s;hould never make a God of our Belly, by devoting our Study, our Time, our E&s;tates, to plea&s;e it,</P>
<P>The Sum of what I have &s;aid, amounts to This.</P>
<P>Our Fa&s;ts humble and afflict our Souls; they prepare and qualify us for higher, and nobler, and more refined Satisfactions.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="28">
<P>They promote the Ardors of Devotion, and tend to produce many excellent Graces in us.</P>
<P>Therefore let us turn unto God, with all our Heart, with Fa&s;tings and Mortifications.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e &s;hall enable us to carry on that ble&s;&s;ed End, and a&s;&s;i&s;t us in <HI>turning unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>And give me Leave to enforce and drive this Home upon you, by all tho&s;e weighty Con&s;i|derations, that u&s;e to affect either Men or Chri&s;|tians.</P>
<P>For if Gratitude can have any Power over us (and 'tis mo&s;t apt to work upon ingenuous Minds);</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, by the Riches of his Goodne&s;s (<HI>by his Patience, Forbearance, and Long &mdash; Suffering, towards us mi&s;erable Sinners), that you pre&s;ent your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, and acceptable unto him; that you would glorify God in your Bodies, and in your Spirits, which are God's.</HI></P>
<P>For this is one of the Inferences that the Apo&s;tle draws from the Benefits that we have received; <HI>You are bought with a Brice; there|fore glori&s;y God.</HI></P>
<P>If the Importunity of God him&s;elf can chal|lenge any Regard, how oft are we invited! How importunately are we &s;olicited! How ear|ne&s;tly are we courted, <HI>to turn unto our God!</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>we will hear the Prophets;</HI> this was their main Errand, to engage Men to turn from all their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; &s;o that Iniquity might not be their Ruin: <HI>Turn ye, turn ye; Why will ye die! Why will you break through all the&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="29">Obligations, and madly chu&s;e your own De|&s;truction?</HI></P>
<P>The Go&s;pel is the Mini&s;try of Reconcilia|tion, and the Publi&s;hers of it were Emba&s;&s;a|dors of Heaven, and u&s;ed all their earne&s;t Endeavours <HI>to turn Men from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity can excite our Indu&s;try</HI> (and it u&s;es in other Ca&s;es to be a &s;trong and powerful Argument), Why do we not turn to God with all our Hearts? &s;ince we mu&s;t either do it, or it had been good for us, that we had not been born; that we had never &s;een the Light, nor known what it is to breathe in this World.</P>
<P>There is an indi&s;pen&s;able Nece&s;&s;ity of turning unto God, as we ever hope to live with him; and mo&s;t Men are &s;o feelingly convinced of this, that they do not expect a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Pa|radi&s;e beyond the Grave; nor believe that their Lu&s;ts and Vices &s;hall admit them to the Glories of a heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P>But here is the great Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin; Men that are once engaged in wicked Cour&s;es, put the evil Day far from them; they hope to repent, and turn unto God in the Time of their Sickne&s;s, or in their old Age: By which they grant 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to be done; tho' at pre&s;ent they have no Inclination <HI>to turn unto their God.</HI></P>
<P>But is any Man a&s;&s;ured, that he &s;hall be &s;ick before he dies? Or, if he be, that he &s;hall have the U&s;e of his Under&s;tanding, and his Memory?</P>
<PB N="27" REF="30">
<P>Does not the &s;ettling of our temporal Af|fairs often devour all the Intervals of our Time, all the little Ce&s;&s;ations from Pain? And when we are re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y, and full of To&s;&s;ings unto the Dawning of the Day; when we wi&s;h in the Morning, Would God it were Evening! and in the Evening, Would God it were Morning! when we are equally weary of the chearful Light, and the melancholy Darkne&s;s;</P>
<P>When our Friends cannot give us any Re|&s;pite, and we are only &s;olicitous for an ea&s;ier Po&s;ture;</P>
<P>When our Fancies are full of &s;trange incon|&s;i&s;tent Ramblings, and our &s;ickly Dreams are nothing but a wild Heap of confu&s;ed Images;</P>
<P>Are we then fit to repent, when we are un|able to think? And can we turn unto God, when we cannot recollect our Sins, and want an Head to &s;et in Order before us the Things that we have done.</P>
<P>Or, if we could, are we a&s;&s;ured, that he would accept our late-intended Repentance? For tho' he hath promi&s;ed Remi&s;&s;ion to all that repent; yet he has no-where promi&s;ed the Grace of Repentance to tho&s;e that defer it to &s;uch an Hour.</P>
<P>Nor is old Age a proper Sea&s;on for that which requires the Vigour of our Faculties; and few reach to that; or, if they do, they &s;till flatter them&s;elves with living longer; and tho' they are aged, yet they would be older before they repent.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="31">
<P>Be&s;ides, that Age is generally attended with &s;o many Infirmities, that the Man is a kind of a living Ho&s;pital: He can groan and &s;igh, and weary both him&s;elf, and others, with Com|plaints: But his Faculties are dull and heavy; they are weak and feeble; the Staff, and the Couch, bring the Man to Childhood again; and he is helple&s;s, in extreme old Age, as tho&s;e that are only beginning to live.</P>
<P>If our own mo&s;t &s;olemn Vows and Obliga|tions can be powerful enough to hold us to this Duty; Did not our Bapti&s;mal Engagement tie us to renounce the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil? And what is this, <HI>but to turn unto God?</HI> Did not our Sacramental Promi&s;es oblige us to amend our Lives, to change our vicious Habits? And did we not u&s;e this Day a &s;o|lemn Prayer? <Q>Turn thou us, O Lord, and &startq;&s;o &s;hall we be turned: Be favourable, be fa|vourable, to thy People, that turn unto thee, &endq;with Weeping, Fa&s;ting, and Praying.</Q></P>
<P>Either we were in Earne&s;t, or we were not, when we thus &s;poke with our Lips; and he that is not &s;erious at his Prayers, adds the ba&s;e and vile Sin of Hypocri&s;y to his other heinous Guilt: And he that will di&s;&s;emble with his God, that &s;earches his Heart, knows his Spirit, and under&s;tands the mo&s;t retired Motions of his Soul, is in a de&s;perate Condition: <HI>Ne Salus quidem ip&s;a &s;ervare pote&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Salvation it&s;elf cannot &s;ave the Man, that has Impudence enough to di&s;&s;emble with him that made him: There is not (neither indeed
<PB N="29" REF="32">can be) a more heinous Wickedne&s;s than Hy|pocri&s;y.</P>
<P>If Intere&s;t (which u&s;es to move the whole World) can have any good Effect upon us; then we are &s;ure, that if we, through the Spi|rit, do mortify the Deeds of the Fle&s;h, we &s;hall live. If we, that have wa&s;ted our Goods, will return; if we will ari&s;e, and go to our Father; he &s;tands ready, with open Arms, to receive us.</P>
<P><HI>If Danger can rou&s;e and awaken a lethargic Soul;</HI> there is a Place of Torment for a <HI>Dives;</HI> where he mu&s;t not only want his Purple, and fine Linen, his &s;parkling Wines, and his luxu|rious Diet (his fawning Para&s;ites, and his lewd Companions); but, in&s;tead of the&s;e, he is condemned to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Pains; and he that &s;wam in Plenty, cries out to <HI>Abraham, &mdash;Send</HI> Lazarus, <HI>that he may dip the Tip of his Finger in Water, and cool my Tongue; for I am tormented in the&s;e Flames.</HI></P>
<P>Let us, then, ask our&s;elves the Prophet's Que&s;tion; <HI>Who among&s;t us can live with the devouring Flames? Who can dwell with ever|la&s;ting Burnings?</HI></P>
<P>Let us take the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s Advice; <HI>Con&s;ider this, and &s;hew your&s;elves Men: Bring it again to Mind, O! ye Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors: Act like Creatures endued with Rea&s;on and Under|&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>And let us embrace the wi&s;e Coun&s;el of the Son of <HI>Sirach: Say not</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that God's Mercy is great, and he will be pacified for the
<PB N="30" REF="33">Multitude of my Sins; for Mercy and Wrath come from him; and his Indignation re&s;ts upon Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>Make then no tarrying, to turn unto the Lord, and put not off from Day to Day; for &s;uddenly &s;hall the Wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy Security thou &s;halt be de|&s;troyed, and peri&s;h in the Day of Vengeance.</P>
<P>God, of his infinite Mercy, give us Grace, with all the Powers of our Minds, to <HI>turn unto him,</HI> and &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the Things that belong to our Peace; and enable us to &s;ubdue our Lu&s;ts, and conquer our&s;elves! So, we may humbly hope to be victorious over all our Enemies abroad, and &s;oon have the Ble&s;&s;ing of an honourable and la&s;ting Peace.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;hut up all, in the Words of our Holy Mother, the Church.</P>
<P><HI>O Lord, who for our &s;ake did&s;t fa&s;t Forty Days and Forty Nights; Give us Grace to u&s;e &s;uch Ab&s;tinence, that our Fle&s;h being &s;ubdued to the Spirit, we may ever obey thy godly Motions, in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s, to thy Honour and Glory, who live&s;t and reigne&s;t with the Father, and the Holy Gho&s;t, World without End.</HI> Amen.</P>
