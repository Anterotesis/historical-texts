<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which certain per&s;onages of this de|lightful
hi&s;tory are introduced to the
reader's acquaintance.</HEAD>
<P>IT was on the great northern road
from York to London, about the
beginning of the month October, and
the hour of eight in the evening, that
four travellers were by a violent &s;hower
of rain driven for &s;helter into a little
public hou&s;e on the &s;ide of the high|way,
di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;ign which
was &s;aid to exhibit the figure of a black
lion. The kitchen, in which they
a&s;&s;embled, was the only room for en|tertainment
in the hou&s;e, paved with
red bricks, remarkably clean, furni&s;h|ed
<PB N="2" REF="5">
with three or four Wind&s;or chairs,
adorned with &s;hining plates of pewter,
and copper &s;auce-pans nicely &s;coured,
that even dazzled the eyes of the be|holder;
while a chearful fire of &s;ea|coal
blazed in the chimney. Three
of the travellers, who arrived on
hor&s;eback, having &s;een their cattle
properly accommodated in the &s;table,
agreed to pa&s;s the time, until the wea|ther
&s;hould clear up, over a bowl of
rumbo, which was accordingly pre|pared:
but the fourth, refu&s;ing to
join their company, took his &s;tation
at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the chimney,
and called for a pint of two-penny,
with which he indulged him&s;elf apart.
At a little di&s;tance, on his left hand,
there was another groupe, con&s;i&s;ting
of the landlady a decent widow, her
two daughters, the elder of whom
&s;eemed to be about the age of fifteen,
and a country lad, who &s;erved both as
waiter and o&s;tler.</P>
<P>The &s;ocial triumvirate was com|po&s;ed
of Mr. Fillet, a country practi|tioner
in &s;urgery and midwifery, Capt.
<PB N="3" REF="6">
Crowe, and his nephew Mr. Thomas
Clarke, an attorney. Fillet was a
man of &s;ome education, and a great
deal of experience, &s;hrewd, &s;ly, and
&s;en&s;ible. Capt. Crowe had command|ed
a merchant-&s;hip in the Mediter|ranean-trade
for many years, and
&s;aved &s;ome money by dint of fruga|lity
and traffick. He was an excel|lent
&s;eaman, brave, active, friendly
in his way, and &s;crupulou&s;ly hone&s;t;
but as little acquainted with the world
as a &s;ucking child; whim&s;ical, impa|tient,
and &s;o impetuous that he could
not help breaking in upon the con|ver&s;ation,
whatever it might be, with
repeated interruptions, that &s;eemed to
bur&s;t from him by involuntary im|pul&s;e:
when he him&s;elf attempted to
&s;peak, he never fini&s;hed his period;
but made &s;uch a number of abrupt
tran&s;itions, that his di&s;cour&s;e &s;eemed
to be an unconnected &s;eries of unfi|ni&s;hed
&s;entences, the meaning of which
it was not ea&s;y to decypher. His ne|phew,
Tom Clarke, was a young fel|low,
who&s;e goodne&s;s of heart even
<PB N="4" REF="7">
the exerci&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion had not
been able to corrupt. Before &s;tran|gers
he never owned him&s;elf an at|torney,
without blu&s;hing, though he
had no rea&s;on to blu&s;h for his own
practice; for he con&s;tantly refu&s;ed to
engage in the cau&s;e of any client
who&s;e character was equivocal, and
was never known to act with &s;uch in|du&s;try
as when concerned for the wi|dow
and orphan, or any other object
that &s;ued <HI>in forma pauperis.</HI> Indeed
he was &s;o repiete with human kind|ne&s;s,
that as often as an affecting &s;to|ry
or circum&s;tance was told in his hear|ing,
it overflowed at his eyes. Being
of a warm complexion, he was very
&s;u&s;ceptible of pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;omewhat
libertine in his amours. In other re|&s;pects,
he piqued him&s;elf on under|&s;tanding
the practice of the courts,
and in private company he took plea|&s;ure
in laying down the law; but he
was an indifferent orator, and tediou&s;ly
circum&s;tantial in his explanations: his
&s;tature was rather diminutive; but,
upon the whole, he had &s;ome title to
<PB N="5" REF="8">
the character of a pretty, dapper, lit|tle
fellow. The &s;olitary gue&s;t had
&s;omething very forbidding in his a&s;pect,
which was contracted by an habitual
frown. His eyes were &s;mall and red,
and &s;o deep &s;et in the &s;ockets, that each
appeared like the undi&s;tingui&s;hed &s;nuff
of a farthing-candle, gleaming through
the horn of a dark lanthorn. His no|&s;trils
were elevated in &s;corn, as if his
&s;en&s;e of &s;melling had been perpetually
offended by &s;ome un&s;avory odour;
and he looked as if he wanted to &s;hrink
within him&s;elf, from the imperti|nence
of &s;ociety. He wore a black
periwig as &s;traight as the pinions of
a raven, and this was covered with
an hat flapped, and fa&s;tened to his
head by a &s;peckled handkerchief tied
under his chin. He was wrapped in
a great coat of brown frize, under
which he &s;eemed to conceal a &s;mall
bundle. His name was Ferret, and
his character di&s;tingui&s;hed by three
peculiarities. He was never &s;een to
&s;mile: he was never heard to &s;peak
in prai&s;e of any per&s;on what&s;oever;
<PB N="6" REF="9">
and he was never known to give a di|rect
an&s;wer to any que&s;tion that was
a&s;ked: but &s;eemed, on all occa&s;ions,
to be actuated by the mo&s;t perver&s;e
&s;pirit of contradiction.</P>
<P>Capt. Crowe, having remarked that
it was &s;qually weather, a&s;ked how far
it was to the next market-town; and
under&s;tanding that the di&s;tance was
not le&s;s than &s;ix miles, &s;aid he had a
good mind to come to an anchor for
the night, if &s;o be as he could have a
tolerable <HI>berth</HI> in this here harbour.
Mr. Fillet, perceiving by his &s;tile that
he was a &s;ea-faring gentleman, ob&s;er|ved
that their landlady was not u&s;ed
to lodge &s;uch company; and expre&s;&s;ed
&s;ome &s;urprize, that he who had no
doubt endured &s;o many &s;torms and
hard&s;hips at &s;ea, &s;hould think much
of travelling five or &s;ix miles a hor&s;e-back
by moon-light. &startq;For my part,
&s;aid he, I ride in all weathers, and at
all hours, without minding cold, wet,
wind, or darkne&s;s. My con&s;titution
is &s;o ca&s;e-hardened, that I believe I
could live all the year at Spitzbergen.
<PB N="7" REF="10">
With re&s;pect to this road, I know
every foot of it &s;o exactly, that I'll
engage to travel forty miles upon it
blindfold, without making one fal&s;e
&s;tep; and if you have faith enough
to put your&s;elves under my au&s;pices,
I will conduct you &s;afe to an elegant
inn, where you will meet with the
be&s;t accommodation.&endq; &startq;Thank you,
brother, (replied the Captain:) we
are much beholden to you for your
courteous offer; but, how&s;omever,
you mu&s;t not think I mind foul wea|ther
more than my neighbours. I
have worked hard aloft and allow in
many a taught gale&mdash;but this here
is the ca&s;e, d'ye &s;ee; we have run
down a long day's reckoning: our
bea&s;ts have had a hard &s;pell; and as
for my own hap, brother, I doubt
my bottom-planks have lo&s;t &s;ome of
their &s;heathing, being as how I a'n't
u&s;ed to that kind of &s;crubbing.&endq;</P>
<P>The doctor, who had practi&s;ed on
board a man of war in his youth,
and was perfectly well acquainted
with the Captain's dialect, a&s;&s;ured him,
<PB N="8" REF="11">
that if his bottom was damaged, he
would <HI>new-pay</HI> it with an excellent
&s;alve, which he always carried about
him, to guard again&s;t &s;uch accidents
on the road: but Tom Clarke, who
&s;eemed to have ca&s;t the eyes of affec|tion
upon the landlady's elde&s;t daugh|ter,
Dolly, objected to their proceeding
farther without re&s;t and refre&s;hment,
as they had already travelled fifty miles
&s;ince morning; and he was &s;ure his
uncle mu&s;t be fatigued both in mind
and body, from vexation as well as
from a hard exerci&s;e, to which he
had not been accu&s;tomed. Fillet then
de&s;i&s;ted, &s;aying, he was &s;orry to find
the Captain had any cau&s;e for vexa|tion;
but he hoped it was not an in|curable
evil. This expre&s;&s;ion was ac|companied
with a look of curio&s;ity,
which Mr. Clarke was glad of an oc|ca&s;ion
to gratify; for, as we have
hinted above, he was a very commu|nicative
gentleman, and the affair
which now lay upon his &s;tomach in|tere&s;ted
him nearly. &startq;I'll a&s;&s;ure you,
Sir, (&s;aid he) this here gentleman,
<PB N="9" REF="12">
captain Crowe, who is my mother's
own brother, has been cruelly u&s;ed by
&s;ome of his relations. He bears as
good a character as any captain of a
&s;hip on the Royal Exchange, and
has undergone a variety of hard&s;hips
at &s;ea. What d'ye think, now, of
his bur&s;ting all his &s;inews, and making
his eyes &s;tart out of his head, in pul|ling
his &s;hip off a rock, whereby he
&s;aved to his owners&endq;&mdash;Here he was
interrupted by the Captain, who ex|claimed,
&startq;Belay, Tom Belay:&mdash;
prithee, don't veer out &s;uch a deal of
jaw. Clap a &s;topper on thy cable,
and bring thy&s;elf up, my lad.&mdash;
What a deal of &s;tuff thou ha&s;t pump|ed
up concerning bur&s;ting, and &s;tart|ing,
and pulling &s;hips, Laud have
mercy upon us!&mdash;Look ye here
brother&mdash;look ye here&mdash;mind the&s;e
poor crippled joints: two fingers on
the &s;tarboard, and three on the lar|board
hand: crooked, d'ye &s;ee, like
the knees of a bilander.&mdash;I'll tell you
what, brother, you &s;eem to be a&mdash;
&s;hip deep laden&mdash;rich cargoe&mdash;cur|rent
<PB N="10" REF="13">
&s;etting into the bay&mdash;hard gale
&mdash;lee &s;hore&mdash;all hands in the boat&mdash;
tow round the headland&mdash;&s;elf pulling
for dear blood, again&s;t the whole crew.
&mdash;Snap go the finger-braces&mdash;crack
went the eye-blocks.&mdash;Bounce day|light
&mdash;fla&s;h &s;tarlight&mdash;down I foun|dered,
dark as hell&mdash;whizz went my
ears, and my head &s;pun like a whir|ligig.&mdash;
That don't &s;ignify&mdash;I'm a
York&s;hire boy, as the &s;aying is&mdash;
all my life at &s;ea, brother, by rea&s;on
of an old grandmother and maiden
aunt, a couple of old &s;tinking&mdash;kept
me the&s;e forty years out of my grand|father's
e&s;tate.&mdash;Hearing as how they
had taken their departure, came a&s;hore,
hired hor&s;es, and clapped on all my
canvas, &s;teering to the northward, to
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my&mdash;But it don't
&s;ignify talking&mdash;the&s;e two old pirati|cal&mdash;had
held a palaver with a lawyer
&mdash;an attorney, Tom, d'ye mind me,
an attorney&mdash;and by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance
hove me out of my inheritance:&mdash;
that is all, brother&mdash;hove me out of
five hundred pounds a year&mdash;that's
<PB N="11" REF="14">
all&mdash;what &s;ignifies&mdash;but &s;uch wind|falls
we don't every day pick up along
&s;hore.&mdash;Fill about, brother&mdash;yes, by
the Lord! tho&s;e two &s;muggling har|ridans,
with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an attor|ney&mdash;an
attorney, Tom&mdash;hove me
out of five hundred a year.&endq; &startq;Yes,
indeed, Sir, (added Mr. Clarke,) tho&s;e
two malicious old women docked the
intail, and left the e&s;tate to an alien.&endq;</P>
<P>Here Mr. Ferret thought proper to
intermingle in the conver&s;ation with a
&startq;<HI>Pi&s;h,</HI> what, do'&s;t talk of docking
the intail? Do'&s;t not know that by
the Statute We&s;tm. 2. 13 Ed. the will
and intention of the donor mu&s;t be
fulfilled, and the tenant in <HI>tail</HI> &s;hall
not alien after i&s;&s;ue had, or before.&endq;
&startq;Give me leave, Sir, (replied Tom)
I pre&s;ume you are a practitioner in the
law. Now you know, that in the ca&s;e
of a contingent <HI>remainder,</HI> the intail
may be de&s;troyed by levying a fine,
and &s;uffering a recovery; or other|wi&s;e
de&s;troying the particular e&s;tate,
before the contingency happens. If
<HI>feoffees,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;s an e&s;tate only du|ring
<PB N="12" REF="15">
the life of a &s;on, where divers
<HI>remainders</HI> are limited over, make a
<HI>feoffment</HI> in fee to him, by the <HI>feoff|ment</HI>
all the future <HI>remainders</HI> are de|&s;troyed.
Indeed, a per&s;on in <HI>remain|der</HI>
may have a writ of Intru&s;ion, if
any do intrude after the death of a
tenant for life; and the writ <HI>ex gravi
querela</HI> lies to execute a devi&s;e in <HI>re|mainder,</HI>
after the death of tenant in
tail without i&s;&s;ue.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Spoke like a
true di&s;ciple of Geber,&endq; cries Ferrett.
&startq;No, Sir, (replied Mr. Clarke) coun|&s;ellor
Caper is in the conveyancing-way&mdash;I
was clerk to &s;erjeant Croaker.&endq;
&startq;Ay, now you may &s;et up for your|&s;elf;
(re&s;umed the other) for you
can prate as unintelligibly as the be&s;t
of them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Perhaps (&s;aid Tom) I do not
make my&s;elf under&s;tood: if &s;o be as
how that is the ca&s;e, let us change the
po&s;ition; and &s;uppo&s;e that this here
ca&s;e is a <HI>tail after a po&s;&s;ibility of i&s;&s;ue
extinct.</HI> If a tenant in <HI>tail,</HI> after a
po&s;&s;ibility, make a <HI>feoffment</HI> of his
land, he in rever&s;ion may enter for
<PB N="13" REF="16">
the forfeiture. Then we mu&s;t make
a di&s;tinction between <HI>general tail</HI> and
<HI>&s;pecial tail.</HI> It is the word <HI>body</HI> that
makes the <HI>intail:</HI>&mdash;there mu&s;t be
<HI>body</HI> in the <HI>tail,</HI> devi&s;ed to heirs male
or female, otherwi&s;e it is a fee-&s;imple,
becau&s;e it is not limited of what <HI>body.</HI>
Thus a corporation cannot be &s;eized in
<HI>tail.</HI> For example: here is a young
woman&mdash;What is your name, my
dear? &startq;Dolly,&endq; an&s;wered the daugh|ter,
with a curt&s;y. &startq;Here's Dolly&mdash;
I &s;eize Dolly <HI>in tail</HI>&mdash;Dolly I &s;eize
you in <HI>tail</HI>&endq;&mdash;&startq;Sha't then,&endq; cried
Dolly, pouting. &startq;I am &s;eized of land
in fee&mdash;I &s;ettle on Dolly in <HI>tail.</HI>&endq;&mdash;
Dolly, who did not comprehend the
nature of the illu&s;tration, under&s;tood
him in a literal &s;en&s;e, and in a whim|pering
tone exclaimed, &startq;Sha't then,
I tell thee, cur&s;ed tuoad!&endq; Tom,
however, was &s;o tran&s;ported with his
&s;ubject, that he took no notice of poor
Dolly's mi&s;take; but proceeded in his
harangue upon the different kinds of
<HI>tails, remainders,</HI> and <HI>&s;ei&s;ins,</HI> when
he was interrupted by a noi&s;e that a|larmed
<PB N="14" REF="17">
the whole company. The
rain had been &s;ucceeded by a &s;torm
of wind, that howled around the
hou&s;e with the mo&s;t &s;avage impetuo&s;i|ty;
and the heavens were overca&s;t
in &s;uch a manner, that not one &s;tar
appeared, &s;o that all without was
darkne&s;s and uproar. This aggravated
the horror of divers loud &s;creams,
which even the noi&s;e of the bla&s;t could
not exclude from the a&s;toni&s;hed ears
of our travellers. Capt. Crowe called
out, &startq;Ava&s;t, ava&s;t:&endq; Tom Clarke
&s;at &s;ilent, &s;taring wildly, with his
mouth &s;till open: the &s;urgeon him|&s;elf
&s;eemed &s;tartled, and Ferret's coun|tenance
betrayed evident marks of con|fu&s;ion.
The o&s;tler moved nearer the
chimney, and the good woman of
the hou&s;e, with her two daughters,
crept clo&s;e to the company.</P>
<P>After &s;ome pau&s;e, the Captain &s;tart|ing
up, &startq;The&s;e (&s;aid he) be &s;ignals
of di&s;tre&s;s. Some poor &s;ouls in dan|ger
of foundering.&mdash;Let us bear up
a-head, and &s;ee if we can give them
any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&endq; The landlady begged
<PB N="15" REF="18">
him, for Chri&s;tis &s;ake, not to think of
going out; for it was a &s;pirit that
would lead him a&s;tray into fens and
rivers, and certainly do him a mi&s;chief.
Crowe &s;eemed to be &s;taggered by this
remon&s;trance, which his nephew rein|forced,
ob&s;erving, that it might be
a &s;tratagem of rogues to decoy them
into the fields, that they might rob
them under cloud of night. Thus
exhorted, he re&s;umed his &s;eat; and
Mr. Ferret began to make very &s;evere
&s;trictures upon the folly and fear of
tho&s;e who believed and trembled at
the vi&s;itation of &s;pirits, gho&s;ts, and
goblins. He &s;aid, he would engage
with twelve penny-worth of pho&s;pho|rus
to frighten a whole pari&s;h out of
their &s;en&s;es: then he expatiated on the
pu&s;illanimity of the nation in general;
ridiculed the militia, cen&s;ured the go|vernment;
and dropped &s;ome hints
about a change of hands, which
the Captain could not, and the Doc|tor
would not comprehend. Tom
Clarke, from the freedom of his di&s;|cour&s;e,
concluded he was a mini&s;te|rial
<PB N="16" REF="19">
&s;py, and communicated his opi|nion
to his uncle in a whi&s;per, while
this mi&s;anthrope continued to pour
forth his invectives with a fluency pe|culiar
to him&s;elf. The truth is, Mr.
Ferret had been a party-writer, not
from principle, but employment, and
had felt the rod of power; in order
to avoid a &s;econd exertion of which,
he now found it convenient to &s;culk
about in the country: for he had re|ceived
intimation of a warrant from
the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who wanted to
be better acquainted with his per&s;on.
Notwith&s;tanding the tickli&s;h nature of
his &s;ituation, it was become &s;o habi|tual
to him to think and &s;peak in a
certain manner, that even before &s;tran|gers,
who&s;e principles and con|nexions
he could not po&s;&s;ibly know,
he hardly ever opened his mouth,
without uttering &s;ome direct or im|plied
&s;arca&s;m again&s;t the govern|ment.
He had already proceeded a
con&s;iderable way in demon&s;trating,
that the nation was bankrupt and beg|gared,
and that tho&s;e who &s;tood at
<PB N="17" REF="20">
the helm were &s;teering full into the
gulph of inevitable de&s;truction; when
his lecture was &s;uddenly &s;u&s;pended by
a violent knocking at the door, which
threatened the whole hou&s;e with im|mediate
demolition. Capt. Crowe,
believing they &s;hould be in&s;tantly
boarded, un&s;heathed his hanger, and
&s;tood in a po&s;ture of defence. Mr.
Fillet armed him&s;elf with the poker,
which happened to be red-hot: the
o&s;tler pulled down a ru&s;ty firelock,
that hung by the roof, over a flitch
of bacon. Tom Clarke, perceiving
the landlady and her children di&s;tract|ed
with terror, conducted them, out
of meer compa&s;&s;ion, below &s;tairs in|to
the cellar; and as for Mr. Ferret,
he prudently withdrew into an adjoin|ing
pantry. But as a per&s;onage of
great importance in this entertaining
hi&s;tory was forced to remain &s;ome
time at the door, before he could gain
admittance, &s;o mu&s;t the reader wait
with patience for the next chapter, in
which he will &s;ee the cau&s;e of this di&s;|turbance
<PB N="18" REF="21">

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which the hero of the&s;e adventures
makes his fir&s;t appearance on the &s;tage
of action.</HEAD>
<P>THE outward door of the Black
Lion had already &s;u&s;tained two
dreadful &s;hocks; but at the third it
flew open, and in &s;talked an appari|tion,
that &s;mote the hearts of our tra|vellers
with fear and trepidation. It
was the figure of a man armed cap-a-pie,
bearing on his &s;houlder a bun|dle
dropping with water, which af|terwards
appeared to be the body of
a man that &s;eemed to have been
drowned, and fi&s;hed up from the bot|tom
of the neighbouring river. Hav|ing
depo&s;ited his burthen carefully on
the floor, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the
company in the&s;e words: &startq;Be not
&s;urpri&s;ed, good people, at this un|u&s;ual
appearance, which I &s;hall take
an opportunity to explain; and for|give
<PB N="19" REF="22">
the rude and boi&s;terous manner
in which I have demanded, and in|deed
forced admittance. The violence
of my intru&s;ion was the effect of ne|ce&s;&s;ity.
In cro&s;&s;ing the river, my
&s;quire and his hor&s;e were &s;wept away
by the &s;tream; and with &s;ome diffi|culty
I have been able to drag him
a&s;hore, though I am afraid my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
reached him too late: for, &s;ince
I brought him to land, he has given
no &s;igns of life.&endq; Here he was in|terrupted
by a groan, which i&s;&s;ued from
the che&s;t of the &s;quire, and terrified
the &s;pectators as much as it comforted
the ma&s;ter. After &s;ome recollection,
Mr. Fillet began to undre&s;s the body,
which was laid in a blanket on the
floor, and rolled from &s;ide to &s;ide by
his direction. A con&s;iderable quan|tity
of water being di&s;charged from
the mouth of this unfortunate &s;quire,
he uttered a hideous roar, and, open|ing
his eyes, &s;tared wildly around:
then the &s;urgeon undertook for his re|covery;
and his ma&s;ter went forth
with the o&s;tler in que&s;t of the hor&s;es,
<PB N="20" REF="23">
which he had left by the &s;ide of the
river. His back was no &s;ooner turn|ed
than Ferret, who had been peep|ing
from behind the pantry-door, ven|tured
to rejoin the company; pro|nouncing
with a &s;mile, or rather grin
of contempt, &startq;Hey day! what pre|cious
mummery is this? What, are
we to have the farce of Hamlet's
gho&s;t?&endq; &startq;Adzooks, (cried the Cap|tain)
my kin&s;man Tom has dropped
a-&s;tern&mdash;hope in God a-has not bulged
to, and gone to bottom.&endq; &startq;Pi&s;h,
(exclaimed the mi&s;anthrope) there's
no danger: the young lawyer is only
&s;eizing Dolly in tail.&endq;</P>
<P>Certain it is, Dolly &s;queaked at that
in&s;tant in the cellar; and Clarke ap|pearing
&s;oon after in &s;ome confu&s;ion,
declared &s;he had been frightened by
a fla&s;h of lightning: but this a&s;&s;ertion
was not confirmed by the young lady
her&s;elf, who eyed him with a &s;ullen
regard, indicating di&s;plea&s;ure, though
not indifference; and when que&s;tioned
by her mother, replied, &startq;A-doan't
<PB N="21" REF="24">
maind what a-&s;ays, &s;o a-doan't, vor
all his goalden jacket, then.&endq;</P>
<P>In the mean time the &s;urgeon had
performed the operation of phlebo|tomy
on the &s;quire, who was lifted
into a chair, and &s;upported by the
landlady for that purpo&s;e; but he
had not as yet given any &s;ign of having
retrieved the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es. And
here Mr. Fillet could not help con|templating,
with &s;urprize, the &s;trange
figure and accoutrements of his patient,
who &s;eemed in age to be turned of
fifty. His &s;tature was below the mid|dle
&s;ize: he was thick, &s;quat, and
brawny, with a &s;mall protuberance
on one &s;houlder, and a prominent bel|ly,
which, in con&s;equence of the wa|ter
he had &s;wallowed, now &s;trutted
beyond its u&s;ual dimen&s;ions. His
forehead was remarkably convex, and
&s;o very low, that his black bu&s;hy hair
de&s;cended within an inch of his no&s;e:
but this did not conceal the wrinkles
of his front, which were manifold.
His &s;mall glimmering eyes re&s;embled
tho&s;e of the Hamp&s;hire porker, that
<PB N="22" REF="25">
turns up the &s;oil with his projecting
&s;nout. His cheeks were &s;hrivelled
and puckered at the corners, like the
&s;eams of a regimental coat as it comes
from the hands of the contracter: his
no&s;e bore a &s;trong analogy in &s;hape to
a tennis-ball, and in colour to a mul|berry;
for all the water of the river
had not been able to quench the na|tural
fire of that feature. His upper
jaw was furni&s;hed with two long white
&s;harp pointed teeth or fangs, &s;uch as
the reader may have ob&s;erved in the
chaps of a wolf, or full-grown ma&s;|tiff,
and an anatomi&s;t would de&s;cribe
as a preternatural elongation of the
<HI>dentes canini.</HI> His chin was &s;o long,
&s;o peaked, and incurvated, as to form
in profile with his impending forehead
the exact re&s;emblance of a moon in
the fir&s;t quarter. With re&s;pect to his
equipage, he had a leathern cap upon
his head, faced like tho&s;e worn by
marines, and exhibiting in embroidery
the figure of a cre&s;cent. His coat was
of white cloth faced with black, and
cut in a very antique fa&s;hion; and, in
<PB N="23" REF="26">
lieu of a wai&s;tcoat, he wore a buff
jerkin. His feet were ca&s;ed with loo&s;e
bu&s;kins, which, though they ro&s;e
almo&s;t to his knee, could not hide
that curvature known by the appella|tion
of bandy legs. A large &s;tring of
bandaliers garni&s;hed a broad belt that
graced his &s;houlders, from whence
depended an in&s;trument of war, which
was &s;omething between a back-&s;word
and a cutla&s;s; and a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols
were &s;tuck in his girdle. Such was
the figure which the whole company
now &s;urveyed with admiration. After
&s;ome pau&s;e, he &s;eemed to recover his
recollection. He rolled about his eyes
around, and, attentively &s;urveying
every individual, exclaimed, in a
&s;trange tone, &startq;Bodikins! where's
Gilbert?&endq; This interrogation did
not &s;avour much of &s;anity, e&s;pecially
when accompanied with a wild &s;tare,
which is generally interpreted as a
&s;ure &s;ign of a di&s;turbed under&s;tand|ing:
neverthele&s;s, the &s;urgeon endea|voured
to a&s;&s;i&s;t his recollection.
&startq;Come, (&s;aid he) have a good-heart.
<PB N="24" REF="27">
&mdash;How do'&s;t do, friend?&endq; &startq;Do!
(replied the &s;quire) do as well as I
can:&mdash;that's a lie too: I might have
done better. I had no bu&s;ine&s;s to be
here.&endq; &startq;You ought to thank God
and your ma&s;ter (re&s;umed the &s;urgeon)
for the providential e&s;cape you have
had.&endq; &startq;Thank my ma&s;ter! (cried
the &s;quire) thank the devil! Go and
teach your grannum to crack filberds.
I know who I'm bound to pray for,
and who I ought to cur&s;e the longe&s;t
day I have to live.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the Captain interpo&s;ing,
&startq;Nay, brother, (&s;aid he) you are
bound to pray for this here gentleman
as your &s;heet-anchor: for, if &s;o be
as he had not cleared your &s;towage of
the water you had taken in at your
upper works, and lightened your veins,
d'ye &s;ee, by taking away &s;ome of your
blood, adad! you had driven before
the gale, and never been brought up
in this world again, d'ye &s;ee.&endq; &startq;What,
then you would per&s;uade me (replied
the patient) that the only way to &s;ave
my life was to &s;hed my precious blood?
<PB N="25" REF="28">
Look ye, friend, it &s;hall not be lo&s;t
blood to me.&mdash;I take you all to wit|ne&s;s,
that there &s;urgeon, or apothe|cary,
or farrier, or dog-doctor, or
what&s;oever he may be, has robbed
me of the bal&s;am of life:&mdash;he has
not left &s;o much blood in my body
as would fatten a &s;tarved flea.&mdash;O!
that there was a lawyer here to &s;erve
him with a <HI>&s;i&s;erari.</HI>&endq; Then fixing his
eyes upon Ferret, he proceeded:
&startq;An't you a limb of the law, friend?
&mdash;No, I cry you mercy, you look
more like a &s;hew-man or a conjurer.&endq;
&mdash;Ferret, nettled at this addre&s;s, an|&s;wered,
&startq;It would be well for you
that I could conjure a little common
&s;en&s;e into that numb&s;cull of yours.&endq;
&startq;If I want that commodity, (re|joined
the &s;quire) I mu&s;t go to ano|ther
market, I trow.&mdash;You legerde|main
men be more like to conjure the
money from our pockets, than &s;en&s;e
into our &s;culls.&mdash;Vor my own part, I
was once cheated of vorty good &s;hil|lings
by one of your broother cups
and balls.&endq; In all probability he

would have de&s;cended to particulars,
had not he been &s;eized with a return
of his nau&s;ea, which obliged him to
call for a bumper of brandy. This
remedy being &s;wallowed, the tumult
in his &s;tomach &s;ub&s;ided. He de&s;ired
he might be put to-bed without de|lay,
and that half a dozen eggs and a
pound of bacon might, in a couple of
hours, be dre&s;&s;ed for his &s;upper.</P>
<P>He was accordingly led off the
&s;cene by the landlady and her daugh|ter;
and Mr. Ferret had ju&s;t time
to ob&s;erve the fellow was a compo|&s;ition,
in which he did not know whe|ther
knave or fool mo&s;t predominated,
when the ma&s;ter returned from the
&s;table. He had taken off his helmet,
and now di&s;played a very engaging
countenance. His age did not &s;eem
to exceed thirty: he was tall, and
&s;eemingly robu&s;t; his face long and
oval, his no&s;e aquiline, his mouth
furni&s;hed with a &s;et of elegant teeth
white as the drifted &s;now; his com|plexion
clear, and his a&s;pect noble.
His che&s;nut hair loo&s;ely flowed in
<PB N="27" REF="32">
&s;hort natural curls; and his grey eyes
&s;hone with &s;uch vivacity, as plainly
&s;hewed that his rea&s;on was a little di&s;|compo&s;ed.
Such an appearance pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the greater part of the com|pany
in his favour: he bowed round
with the mo&s;t polite and affable ad|dre&s;s;
enquired about his &s;quire, and,
being informed of the pains Mr. Fil|let
had taken for his recovery, in&s;i&s;ted
upon that gentleman's accepting an
hand&s;ome gratuity: then, in con&s;ide|ration
of the cold bath he had un|dergone,
he was prevailed upon to
take the po&s;t of honour; namely,
the great chair fronting the fire, which
was reinforced with a billet of wood
for his comfort and convenience.</P>
<P>Perceiving his fellow-travellers ei|ther
over-awed into &s;ilence by his pre|&s;ence,
or &s;truck dumb with admira|tion
at his equipage, he acco&s;ted them
in the&s;e words, while an agreeable
&s;mile dimpled on his cheek.</P>
<P>&startq;The good company wonders,
no doubt, to &s;ee a man ca&s;ed in ar|mour,
&s;uch as hath been for above
<PB N="28" REF="33">
a whole century di&s;u&s;ed in this and
every other country of Europe; and
perhaps they will be &s;till more &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
when they hear that man pro|fe&s;s
him&s;elf a noviciate of that mi|litary
order, which hath of old been
di&s;tingui&s;hed in Great-Britain, as well
as through all Chri&s;tendom, by the
name of Knights Errant. Yes, gen|tlemen,
in that painful and thorny
path of toil and danger I have begun
my career, a candidate for hone&s;t
fame; determined, as far as in me
lies, to honour and a&s;&s;ert the efforts
of virtue; to combat vice in all her
forms, redre&s;s injuries, cha&s;ti&s;e op|pre&s;&s;ion,
protect the helple&s;s and for|lorn,
relieve the indigent, exert
my be&s;t endeavours in the cau&s;e of
innocence and beauty, and dedicate
my talents, &s;uch as they are, to the
&s;ervice of my country.&endq; &startq;What!
(&s;aid Ferret) you &s;et up for a modern
Don Quixote?&mdash;The &s;cheme is rather
too &s;tale and extravagant.&mdash;What was
an humorous romance, and well-timed
&s;atire in Spain, near two hun|dred
<PB N="29" REF="34">
years ago, will make but a &s;orry
je&s;t, and appear equally in&s;ipid and
ab&s;urd, when really acted from affec|tation,
at this time a-day, in a coun|try
like England.&endq;</P>
<P>The Knight, eying this cen&s;or with
a look of di&s;dain, replied, in a &s;olemn
lofty tone: &startq;He that from affectation
imitates the extravagancies recorded
of Don Quixote, is an impo&s;tor equally
wicked and contemptible. He that
counterfeits madne&s;s, unle&s;s he di&s;|&s;embles
like the elder Brutus, for
&s;ome virtuous purpo&s;e, not only de|ba&s;es
his own &s;oul, but acts as a trai|tor
to heaven, by denying the divinity
that is within him&mdash;I am neither an
affected imitator of Don Quixote,
nor, as I tru&s;t in heaven, vi&s;ited by
that &s;pirit of lunacy &s;o admirably di&s;|played
in the fictitious character exhi|bited
by the inimitable Cervantes. I
have not yet encountered a windmill
for a giant; nor mi&s;taken this public
hou&s;e for a magnificent ca&s;tle: nei|ther
do I believe this gentleman to
be the con&s;table; nor that worthy
<PB N="30" REF="35">
practitioner to be ma&s;ter Elizabat,
the &s;urgeon recorded in Amadis de
Gaul; nor you to be the enchanter
Alquife, nor any other &s;age of hi&s;|tory
or romance.&mdash;I &s;ee and di&s;tin|gui&s;h
objects as they are di&s;cerned
and de&s;cribed by other men. I rea|&s;on
without prejudice, can endure
contradiction, and, as the company
perceives, even bear impertinent cen|&s;ure
without pa&s;&s;ion or re&s;entment.
I quarrel with none but the foes of
virtue and decorum, again&s;t whom I
have declared perpetual war, and
them I will every where attack as the
natural enemies of mankind.&endq; &startq;But
that war (&s;aid the cynic) may &s;oon be
brought to a conclu&s;ion, and your
adventures clo&s;e in Bridewell, pro|vided
you meet with &s;ome determined
con&s;table, who will &s;eize your wor|&s;hip
as a vagrant, according to the
&s;tatute.&endq; &startq;Heaven and earth! (cried
the &s;tranger, &s;tarting up and laying
his hand to his &s;word) do I live to
hear my&s;elf in&s;ulted with &s;uch an op|probrious
epithet, and refrain from
<PB N="31" REF="36">
trampling into du&s;t the in&s;olent calum|niator!&endq;</P>
<P>The tone in which the&s;e words
were pronounced, and the indigna|tion
that fla&s;hed from the eyes of
the &s;peaker, intimidated every indivi|dual
of the &s;ociety, and reduced Fer|ret
to a temporary privation of all his
faculties. His eyes retired within
their &s;ockets: his complexion, which
was naturally of a copper hue, now
&s;hifted to a leaden colour; his teeth
began to chatter; and all his limbs
were agitated by a &s;udden pal&s;y. The
Knight ob&s;erved his condition, and
re&s;umed his feat, &s;aying, &startq;I was to
blame: my vengeance mu&s;t be re|&s;erved
for very different objects.&mdash;
Friend, you have nothing to fear&mdash;the
&s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion is now blown
over. Recollect your&s;elf, and I will
rea&s;on calmly on the ob&s;ervation you
have made.&endq;</P>
<P>This was a very &s;ea&s;onable decla|ration
to Mr. Ferret, who opened his
eyes, and wiped his forehead, while
the other proceeded in the&s;e terms.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="37">
&startq;You &s;ay I am in danger of being
apprehended as a vagrant: I am not
&s;o ignorant of the laws of my coun|try,
but that I know the de&s;cription
of tho&s;e who fall within the legal
meaning of this odious term. You
mu&s;t give me leave to inform you,
friend, that I am neither bearward,
fencer, &s;troller, gip&s;ey, mountebank,
nor mendicant; nor do I practi&s;e &s;ub|tle
craft to deceive and impo&s;e upon
the King's lieges; nor can I be held
as an idle di&s;orderly per&s;on, travelling
from place to place, collecting monies
by virtue of counterfeited pa&s;&s;es, briefs,
and other fal&s;e pretences&mdash;In what
re&s;pect therefore am I to be deemed
a vagrant? An&s;wer boldly, without
fear or &s;cruple.&endq; To this interroga|tion
the mi&s;anthrope replied, with
a faultering accent, &startq;If not a va|grant,
you incur the penalty for rid|ing
armed in affray of the peace.&endq;
&startq;But, in&s;tead of riding armed in
affray of the peace, (re&s;umed the
other) I ride in pre&s;ervation of the
peace; and gentlemen are allowed
<PB N="33" REF="38">
by the law to wear armour for their
defence. Some ride with blunder-bu&s;&s;es,
&s;ome with pi&s;tols, &s;ome with
&s;words, according to their various in|clinations.
Mine is to wear the ar|mour
of my forefathers: perhaps I
u&s;e them for exerci&s;e, in order to ac|cu&s;tom
my&s;elf to fatigue, and &s;trength|en
my con&s;titution: perhaps I a&s;&s;ume
them for a frolick.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But if you &s;wagger armed and
in di&s;gui&s;e, a&s;&s;ault me on the high|way,
or put me in bodily fear, for
the &s;ake of the je&s;t, the law will pu|ni&s;h
you in earne&s;t,&endq; (cried the other.)
&startq;But my intention (an&s;wered the
Knight) is carefully to avoid all tho&s;e
occa&s;ions of offences.&endq; &startq;Then (&s;aid
Ferret) you may go unarmed, like
other &s;ober people.&endq; &startq;Not &s;o, (an|&s;wered
the Knight) as I propo&s;e to
travel all times, and in all places, mine
armour may guard me again&s;t the at|tempts
of treachery: it may defend
me in combat again&s;t odds, &s;hould I be

the philo&s;opher) you intend to co|operate
with the honourable frater|nity
of thief-takers?&endq; &startq;I do pur|po&s;e
(&s;aid the youth, eying him with
a look of ineffable contempt) to act
as a coadjutor to the law, and even to
remedy evils which the law cannot
reach; to detect fraud and trea&s;on,
aba&s;e in&s;olence, mortify pride, di&s;|courage
&s;lander, di&s;grace immode&s;ty,
and &s;tigmatize ingratitude: but the
infamous part of a thief-catcher's cha|racter
I di&s;claim. I neither a&s;&s;ociate
with robbers and pickpockets, know|ing
them to be &s;uch, that, in being
intru&s;ted with their &s;ecrets, I may the
more effectually betray them; nor
&s;hall I ever pocket the reward granted
by the legi&s;lature to tho&s;e by whom
robbers are brought to conviction:
but I &s;hall always think it my duty
to rid my country of that pernicious
vermin, which preys upon the bowels
of the commonwealth&mdash;not but that
an incorporated company of licen&s;ed
thieves might, under proper regula|tions,
<PB N="35" REF="40">
be of &s;ervice to the commu|nity.&endq;</P>
<P>Ferret, emboldened by the pa&s;&s;ive
tamene&s;s with which the &s;tranger
bore his la&s;t reflection, began to think
he had nothing of Hector but his
out&s;ide, and gave a loo&s;e to all the acri|mony
of his party-rancour. Hear|ing
the Knight mention a company of
licen&s;ed thieves, &startq;What el&s;e (cried
he) is the majority of the nation?
What is your &s;tanding army at home,
that eat up their fellow &s;ubjects?
What are your mercenaries abroad,

them&s;elves away? What is your&hellip;..
but a knot of thieves, who pillage
the nation under colour of law, and
enrich them&s;elves with the wreck of
their country? When you con&s;ider
the enormous debt of an hundred
<PB N="36" REF="41">
millions, the intolerable load of taxes
and impo&s;itions under which we groan,
and the manner in which that burthen
is yearly accumulating, to &s;upport two
German electorates, without our re|ceiving
any thing in return but the
&s;hews of triumph and &s;hadows of
conque&s;t: I &s;ay, when you reflect on
the&s;e circum&s;tances, and at the &s;ame
time behold our cities filled with bank|rupts,
and our country with beggars;
can you be &s;o infatuated as to deny
that our m&mdash;y is mad, or wor&s;e than
mad; our wealth exhau&s;ted, our peo|ple
mi&s;erable, our credit bla&s;ted, and
our &s;tate on the brink of perdition?
This pro&s;pect, indeed, will make the
fainter impre&s;&s;ion, if we recollect that
we our&s;elves are a pack of &s;uch pro|fligate,
corrupted, pu&s;illanimous ra&s;|cals,
as de&s;erve no &s;alvation.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;tranger, rai&s;ing his voice to
a loud tone, replied, &startq;Such, indeed,
are the in&s;inuations, equally fal&s;e and
in&s;idious, with which the de&s;perate
emi&s;&s;aries of a party endeavour to
poi&s;on the minds of his Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="37" REF="42">
&s;ubjects, in defiance of common ho|ne&s;ty
and common &s;en&s;e. But he
mu&s;t be blind to all perception, and
dead to candour, who does not &s;ee
and own that we are involved in a
ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war, which has been
maintained on truly Briti&s;h principles,
pro&s;ecuted with vigour, and crowned
with &s;ucce&s;s; that our taxes are ea&s;y,
in proportion to our wealth; that our
conque&s;ts are equally glorious and
important; that our commerce flou|ri&s;hes,
our people are happy, and
our enemies reduced to de&s;pair.&mdash;Is
there a man who boa&s;ts a Briti&s;h heart,
that repines at the &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;pe|rity
of his country? Such there are,
O &s;hame to patrioti&s;m, and reproach
to Great-Britain! who act as the e|mi&s;&s;aries
of France both in word and
writing; who exaggerate our nece&s;|&s;ary
burthens, magnify our dangers,
extol the power of our enemies, de|ride
our victories, extenuate our con|que&s;ts,
condemn the mea&s;ures of our
government, and &s;catter the &s;eeds of
di&s;&s;atisfaction through the land. Such
<PB N="38" REF="43">
dome&s;tic traitors are doubly the ob|jects
of dete&s;tation; fir&s;t, in pervert|ing
truth; and &s;econdly, in propagat|ing
fal&s;ehood, to the prejudice of that
community of which they have pro|fe&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves members. One of
the&s;e is well known by the name of
Ferret, an old, rancorous, incorrigi|ble
in&s;trument of &s;edition: happy
it is for him, that he has never fallen
in my way; for, notwith&s;tanding the
maxims of forbearance which I have
adopted, the indignation which the
character of that caitiff in&s;pires, would
probably impel me to &s;ome act of vio|lence,
and I &s;hould cru&s;h him like an
ungrateful viper, that gnawed the
bo&s;om which warmed it into life!&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words were pronounced
with a wildne&s;s of look, that even
bordered upon frenzy. The mi&s;an|thrope
once more retired to the pan|try
for &s;helter, and the re&s;t of the
gue&s;ts were evidently di&s;concerted.</P>
<P>Mr. Fillet, in order to change the
conver&s;ation, which was likely to
produce &s;erious con&s;equences, expre&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="39" REF="44">
uncommon &s;atisfaction at the re|marks
which the Knight had made,
&s;ignified his approbation of the ho|nourable
office he had undertaken;
declared him&s;elf happy in having
&s;een &s;uch an accompli&s;hed cavalier;
and ob&s;erved, that nothing was want|ing
to render him a complete knight|errant,
but &s;ome celebrated beauty,
the mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart, who&s;e idea
might animate his brea&s;t, and &s;trength|en
his arm to the utmo&s;t exertion of
valour: he added, that love was the
&s;oul of chivalry. The &s;tranger &s;tart|ed
at this di&s;cour&s;e. He turned his
eyes on the &s;urgeon with a fixed re|gard:
his countenance changed: a
torrent of tears gu&s;hed down his
cheeks: his head &s;unk upon his bo|&s;om:
he heaved a profound &s;igh; and
remained in &s;ilence with all the ex|ternal
marks of unutterable &s;orrow.
The company were in &s;ome mea&s;ure
infected by his de&s;pondence; con|cerning
the cau&s;e of which, however,
they would not venture to inquire.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="45">
By this time the landlady, having
di&s;po&s;ed of the &s;quire, de&s;ired to
know, with many curt&s;ies, if his honour
would not chu&s;e to put off his wet
garments; a&s;&s;uring him, that &s;he had
a very good feather-bed at his &s;ervice,
upon which many gentlevolks of the
vir&s;t quality had lain; that the &s;heets
were well aired; and that Dolly &s;hould
warm them for his wor&s;hip with a pan
of coals. This ho&s;pitable offer be|ing
repeated, he &s;eemed to wake from
a trance of grief; aro&s;e from his &s;eat,
and, bowing courteou&s;ly to the com|pany,
withdrew.</P>
<P>Captain Crowe, who&s;e faculty of
&s;peech had been all this time ab&s;orbed
in amazement, now broke into the
conver&s;ation with a volley of inter|jections:
&startq;Split my &s;natchblock!&mdash;Odd's

&s;outh, as the &s;aying is&mdash;Blacks, In|dians,
Moors, Morattos, and Seapoys;&mdash;but,
&s;mite my timbers! &s;uch a man
<PB N="41" REF="46">
of war&mdash;&endq; Here he was interrupted
by his nephew Tom Clarke, who
had di&s;appeared at the Knight's fir&s;t
entrance, and now produced him&s;elf
with an eagerne&s;s in his look, while
the tears &s;tarted in his eyes.&mdash;&startq;Lord
ble&s;s my &s;oul! (cried he) I know that
gentleman, and his &s;ervant, as well
as I know my own father.&mdash;I am his
own god&s;on, uncle: he &s;tood for me
when he was a boy&mdash;yes, indeed, Sir,
my father was &s;teward to the e&s;tate&mdash;I
may &s;ay I was bred up in the family
of Sir Everhard Greaves, who has
been dead the&s;e two years&mdash;this is the
only &s;on, Sir Launcelot; the be&s;t-na|tured,
worthy, generous gentleman&mdash;I
care not who knows it: I love
him as well as if he was my own fle&s;h
and blood&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>At this period Tom, who&s;e heart
was of the melting mood, began to
&s;ob and weep plenteou&s;ly, from pure
affection. Crowe, who was not very
&s;ubject to the&s;e tenderne&s;&s;es, damned
him for a chicken-hearted lubber; re|peating,
with much peevi&s;hne&s;s, &startq;What
<PB N="42" REF="47">
do'&s;t cry for? What do'&s;t cry for, nod|dy?&endq;
The &s;urgeon, impatient to know
the &s;tory of Sir Launcelot, which he
had heard imperfectly recounted, beg|ged
that Mr. Clarke would compo&s;e
him&s;elf, and relate it as circum&s;tantially
as his memory could retain the particu|lars;
and Tom, wiping his eyes, pro|mi&s;ed
to give him that &s;atisfaction;
which the reader, if he be &s;o minded,
may partake in the next chapter.</P>

<P>THE Doctor pre&s;cribed a <HI>repeta|tur</HI>
of the julep, and mixed the
ingredients <HI>&s;ecundem artem;</HI> Tom
Clarke hemmed thrice, to clear his
pipes; while the re&s;t of the com|pany,
including Dolly and her mo|ther,
who had by this time admi|ni&s;tred
to the knight, compo&s;ed them|&s;elves
into earne&s;t and hu&s;hed atten|tion.
Then the young lawyer began
his narration to this effect:&mdash;&startq;I tell
<PB N="43" REF="48">
ye what, gemmen, I don't pretend
in this here ca&s;e to flouri&s;h and ha|rangue
like a&mdash;having never been
called to&mdash;but what of that, d'ye
&s;ee?&mdash;perhaps I may know as much
as&mdash;Facts are facts, as the &s;aying
is.&mdash;I &s;hall tell, repeat, and relate a
plain &s;tory&mdash;matters of fact, d'ye &s;ee,
without rhetoric, oratory, ornament,
or embelli&s;hment; without repetition,
tautology, circumlocution, or going
about the bu&s;h: facts which I &s;hall
aver, partly on the te&s;timony of my
own knowledge, and partly from the
information of re&s;pon&s;ible evidences of
good repute and credit, any circum|&s;tance
known to the contrary notwith|&s;tanding:&mdash;for,
as the law &s;aith, if
&s;o be as how there is <HI>an exception</HI> to
evidence, that <HI>exception</HI> is in its na|ture
but a denial of what is taken to
be good by the other party, and <HI>ex|ceptio
in non exceptis, firmat regulam,</HI>
d'ye &s;ee.&mdash;But, how&s;omever, in re|gard
to this here affair, we need not
be &s;o &s;crupulous as if we were plead|ing
before a judge <HI>&s;edente curia</HI>&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="49">
Ferret, who&s;e curio&s;ity was rather
more eager than that of any other
per&s;on in this audience, being pro|voked
by this preamble, da&s;hed the
pipe he had ju&s;t filled in pieces again&s;t
the grate; and after having pro|nounced
the interjection <HI>pi&s;h,</HI> with
an acrimony of a&s;pect altogether pe|culiar
to him&s;elf, &startq;If (&s;aid he) im|pertinence
and folly were felony by
the &s;tatute, there would be no want
of unexceptionable evidence to hang
&s;uch an eternal babbler.&endq; &startq;Anan,
babbler! (cried Tom, reddening with
pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;tarting up) I'd have you
to know, Sir, that I can bite as well
as babble; and that, if I am &s;o mind|ed,
I can run upon the foot after my
game without being in fault, as the
&s;aying is; and which is more, I can
&s;hake an old fox by the collar.&endq;</P>
<P>How far this young lawyer might
have proceeded to prove him&s;elf
&s;taunch on the per&s;on of the mi&s;an|thrope,
if he had not been prevented,
we &s;hall not determine; but the
whole company were alarmed at his
<PB N="45" REF="50">
looks and expre&s;&s;ions. Dolly's ro&s;y
cheeks a&s;&s;umed an a&s;h-colour, while
&s;he ran between the di&s;putants, cry|ing,
&startq;Naay, naay&mdash;vor the love of
God doant then, doan't then!&endq; But
captain Crowe exerted a parental au|thority
over his nephew, &s;aying, A|va&s;t,
Tom, ava&s;t!&mdash;Snugg's the
word&mdash;we'll have no boarding, d'ye
&s;ee.&mdash;Haul forward thy chair again,
take thy berth, and proceed with thy
&s;tory in a direct cour&s;e, without yaw|ing
like a Dutch yanky.&endq;</P>
<P>Tom, thus tutored, recollected
him&s;elf, re&s;umed his &s;eat, and, after
&s;ome pau&s;e, plunged at once into the
current of narration. &startq;I told you
before, gemmen, that the gentle|man
in armour was the only &s;on of
Sir Everhard Greaves, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
a free e&s;tate of five thou&s;and a year in
our county, and was re&s;pected by all
his neighbours, as much for his per|&s;onal
merit as for his family fortune.
With re&s;pect to his &s;on Launcelot,
whom you have &s;een, I can remem|ber
nothing until he returned from the
<PB N="46" REF="51">
univer&s;ity, about the age of &s;eventeen,
and then I my&s;elf was not more than
ten years old. The young gemman
was at that time in mourning for his
mother; though God he knows, Sir
Everhard had more cau&s;e to rejoice
than to be afflicted at her death:&mdash;
for, among friends, (here he lowered
his voice, and looked round the
kitchen) &s;he was very whim&s;ical, ex|pen&s;ive,
and ill-tempered, and, I'm
afraid, a little&mdash;upon the&mdash;flighty
order&mdash;a little touched or &s;o;&mdash;but
mum for that&mdash;the lady is now dead;
and it is my maxim, <HI>de mortuis nil
ni&s;i bonum.</HI> The young &s;quire was
even then very hand&s;ome, and looked
remarkably well in his weepers: but
he had an aukward air and &s;ham|bling
gait, &s;tooped mortally, and
was &s;o &s;hy and &s;ilent, that he would
not look a &s;tranger in the face, nor
open his mouth before company.
Whenever he &s;pied a hor&s;e or car|riage
at the gate, he would make his
e&s;cape into the garden, and from
thence into the park; where many's
<PB N="47" REF="52">
the good time and often he has been
found &s;itting under a tree, with a
book in his hand, reading Greek,
Latin, and other foreign linguas.</P>
<P>Sir Everhard him&s;elf was no great
&s;cholar, and my father had forgot his
cla&s;&s;ical learning; and &s;o the rector of
the pari&s;h was de&s;ired to examine
young Launcelot. It was a long time
before he found an opportunity: the
&s;quire always gave him the &s;lip.&mdash;
At length the par&s;on catched him in
bed of a morning, and, locking the
door, to it they went tooth and nail.
What pa&s;&s;ed betwixt them the Lord in
heaven knows; but, when the Doctor
came forth, he looked wild and hag|gard
as if he had &s;een a gho&s;t, his
face as white as paper, and his lips
trembling like an a&s;pen-leaf. &startq;Par|&s;on,
(&s;aid the knight) what is the
matter?&mdash;how do'&s;t find my &s;on? I
hope he won't turn out a ninny, and
di&s;grace his family.&endq; The Doctor,
wiping the &s;weat from his forehead,
replied, with &s;ome he&s;itation, &startq;he
could not tell&mdash;he hoped the be&s;t&mdash;
<PB N="48" REF="53">
the &s;quire was to be &s;ure a very ex|traordinary
young gentleman&endq;&mdash;
But the father urging him to give
an explicit an&s;wer, he frankly declar|ed,
that, in his opinion, the &s;on
would turn out either a mirrour of
wi&s;dom, or a monument of folly:
for his genius and di&s;po&s;ition were al|together
preternatural. The knight
was &s;orely vexed at this declaration,
and &s;ignified his di&s;plea&s;ure by &s;aying,
the doctor, like a true prie&s;t, dealt in
my&s;teries and oracles, that would ad|mit
of different and indeed contrary
interpretations. He afterwards con|&s;ulted
my father, who had &s;erved as
&s;teward upon the e&s;tate for above thirty
years, and acquired a con&s;iderable
&s;hare of his favour. &startq;Will. Clarke,
(&s;aid he, with tears in his eyes) what
&s;hall I do with this unfortunate lad?
I would to God he had never been
born; for I fear he will bring my
grey hairs with &s;orrow to the grave.
When I am gone, he will throw
away the e&s;tate, and bring him&s;elf
to infamy and ruin by keeping com|pany
<PB N="49" REF="54">
with rooks and beggars.&mdash;O
Will! I could forgive extravagance
in a young man; but it breaks my
heart to &s;ee my only &s;on give &s;uch
repeated proofs of a mean &s;pirit and
&s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition!&endq;</P>
<P>Here the old gentleman &s;hed a
flood of tears, and not without &s;ome
&s;hadow of rea&s;on. By this time
Launcelot was grown &s;o re&s;erved to
his father, that he &s;eldom &s;aw him,
or any of his relations, except when
he was in a manner forced to appear
at table, and there his ba&s;hfulne&s;s
&s;eemed every day to encrea&s;e. On
the other hand, he had formed &s;ome
very &s;trange connexions. Every morn|ing
he vi&s;ited the &s;table, where he
not only conver&s;ed with the grooms
and helpers, but &s;craped acquaintance
with the hor&s;es: he fed his favourites
with his own hand, &s;troaked, care&s;&s;ed,
and rode them by turns; till at la&s;t
they grew &s;o familiar, that, even when
they were a-field at gra&s;s, and &s;aw
him at a di&s;tance, they would to&s;s
their manes, whinny like &s;o many
<PB N="50" REF="55">
colts at &s;ight of the dam, and, gal|loping
up to the place where he &s;tood,
&s;mell him all over.&mdash;You mu&s;t
know that I my&s;elf, though a child,
was his companion in all the&s;e excur|&s;ions.
He took a liking to me on ac|count
of my being his god&s;on, and
gave me more money than I knew
what to do with: he had always plen|ty
of ca&s;h for the a&s;king, as my fa|ther
was ordered to &s;upply him libe|rally,
the knight thinking that a com|mand
of money might help to rai&s;e
his thoughts to a proper con&s;ideration
of his own importance. He never
could endure a common beggar, that
was not either in a &s;tate of infancy
or of old age: but, in other re&s;pects,
he made the guineas fly in &s;uch a
manner, as looked more like mad|ne&s;s
than genero&s;ity. He had no
communication with your rich yeo|men;
but rather treated them and
their families with &s;tudied contempt,
becau&s;e for&s;ooth they pretended to
a&s;&s;ume the dre&s;s and manners of the
gentry: they kept their footmen,
<PB N="51" REF="56">
their &s;addle-hor&s;es, and chai&s;es: their
wives and daughters appeared in
their jewels, their &s;ilks, and their
&s;attins, their negligees and trollo|pees:
their clum&s;y &s;hanks, like &s;o
many &s;hins of beef, were ca&s;ed in
&s;ilk-ho&s;e and embroidered &s;lippers:
their raw red fingers, gro&s;s as the
pipes of a chamber-organ, which had
been employed in milking the cows,
in twirling the mop or churn-&s;taff,
being adorned with diamonds, were
taught to thrum the pandola, and
even to touch the keys of the harp&s;i|chord:
nay, in every village they kept
a rout and &s;et up an a&s;&s;embly; and
in one place a hog-butcher was ma|&s;ter
of the ceremonies. I have heard
Mr. Greaves ridicule them for their
vanity and aukward imitation; and
therefore, I believe, he avoided all
concerns with them, even when they
endeavoured to engage his attention.
It was the lower &s;ort of people with
whom he chiefly conver&s;ed, &s;uch as
ploughmen, ditchers, and other day-labourers.
To every cottager in the
<PB N="52" REF="57">
pari&s;h he was a bounteous benefactor.
He was, in the literal &s;en&s;e of the
word, a careful over&s;eer of the poor;
for he went from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, in|du&s;triou&s;ly
inquiring into the di&s;tre&s;&s;es
of the people. He repaired their
huts, cloathed their backs, filled their
bellies, and &s;upplied them with ne|ce&s;&s;aries
for exerci&s;ing their indu&s;try
and different occupations.</P>
<P>I'll give you one in&s;tance now, as
a &s;pecimen of his character. He and
I, &s;trolling one day on the &s;ide of a
common, &s;aw two boys picking hips
and haws from the hedges, one &s;eem|ed
to be about five, and the other a
year older: they were both barefoot
and ragged; but at the &s;ame time fat,
fair, and in good condition. &startq;Who
do you belong to?&endq; (&s;aid Mr. Greaves.)
&startq;To Mary Stile, (replied the olde&s;t)
the widow that rents one of them
hou&s;en.&endq; &startq;And how do'&s;t live, my
boy? Thou looke&s;t fre&s;h and jolly;&endq;
re&s;umed the &s;quire. &startq;Lived well
enough till ye&s;terday,&endq; an&s;wered the
child. &startq;And pray what happened
<PB N="53" REF="58">
ye&s;terday, my boy?&endq; continued Mr.
Greaves. &startq;Happened! (&s;aid he)
why, mammy had a coople of lit|tle
Welch keawes, that gi'en milk
enough to fill all our bellies; mam|my's,
and mine, and Dick's here,
and my two little &s;i&s;ters at hoam:
ye&s;terday the &s;quire &s;eized the keawes
for rent, God rot'un! Mammy's
gone to bed &s;ick and &s;ulky: my
two &s;i&s;ters be crying at hoam vor
vood; and Dick and I be come hi|ther
to pick haws and bullies.&endq;&mdash;
My godfather's face grew red as
&s;carlet: he took one of the children
in either hand, and leading them
towards the hou&s;e, found Sir Everhard
talking with my father before
the gate. In&s;tead of avoiding the
old gentleman, as u&s;ual, he bru&s;hed
up to him with a &s;pirit he had ne|ver
&s;hewn before, and pre&s;enting
the two ragged boys, &startq;Surely, Sir,
(&s;aid he) you will not countenance
that there ruffian your &s;teward, in
oppre&s;&s;ing the widow and the father|le&s;s.
On pretence of di&s;training for
<PB N="54" REF="59">
the rent of a cottage, he has robbed
the mother of the&s;e and other poor
infant-orphans of two cows, which
afforded them their whole &s;u&s;te|nance.
Shall you be concerned in
tearing the hard-earned mor&s;el from
the mouth of indigence? Shall your
name, which has been &s;o long men|tioned
as a ble&s;&s;ing, be now dete&s;ted
as a cur&s;e by the poor, the helple&s;s,
and forlorn? The father of the&s;e
babes was once your game-keeper,
who died of a con&s;umption caught
in your &s;ervice.&mdash;You &s;ee they are
almo&s;t naked&mdash;I found them pluck|ing
haws and &s;loes, in order to ap|pea&s;e
their hunger.&mdash;The wretched
mother is &s;tarving in a cold cottage,
di&s;tracted with the cries of other two
infants, clamerous for food; and
while her heart is bur&s;ting with an|gui&s;h
and de&s;pair, &s;he invokes heaven
to avenge the widow's cau&s;e upon the
head of her unrelenting landlord!&endq;</P>
<P>This unexpected addre&s;s brought
tears into the eyes of the good old
gentleman. &startq;Will Clarke, (&s;aid
<PB N="55" REF="60">
he to my father) how dur&s;t you
abu&s;e my authority at this rate?
You who know I have been always
a protector, not an oppre&s;&s;or of the
needy and unfortunate. I charge
you, go immediately and comfort
this poor woman with immediate
relief: in&s;tead of her own cows, let
her have two of the be&s;t milch cows
of my dairy: they &s;hall graze in my
parks in &s;ummer, and be foddered
with my hay in winter.&mdash;She &s;hall
&s;it rent-free for life; and I will take
care of the&s;e her poor orphans.&endq;
This was a very affecting &s;cene.
Mr. Launcelot took his father's hand
and ki&s;&s;ed it, while the tears ran
down his cheeks; and Sir Everha$d
embraced his &s;on with great tender|ne&s;s,
crying, &startq;My dear boy! God
be prai&s;ed for having given you $word$
a feeling heart.&endq; My fath$$ $span$
&s;elf was moved, thof a $span$
of the law, and con&s;equent$ $span$
to di&s;tre&s;&s;es.&mdash;He declared, that he
had given no directions to di&s;train;
and that the bailiff mu&s;t have done
<PB N="56" REF="61">
it by his own authority.&mdash;&startq;If that
be the ca&s;e (&s;aid the young &s;quire)
let the inhuman ra&s;cal be turned out
of our &s;ervice.&endq;</P>
<P>Well, gemmen, all the children
were immediately cloathed and fed,
and the poor widow had well nigh
run di&s;tracted with joy. The old
knight, being of a humane temper
him&s;elf, was plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch
proofs of his &s;on's genero&s;ity: he
was not angry at his &s;pending his
money, but at &s;quandering away his
time among the dregs of the people.
For you mu&s;t know, he not only
made matches, portioned poor mai|dens,
and &s;et up young couples that
came together without money; but
he mingled in every ru&s;tic diver&s;ion,
and bore away the prize in every
conte&s;t. He excelled every &s;wain
of that di&s;trict in feats of &s;trength
and activity; in leaping, running,
wre&s;tling, cricket, cudgel-playing,
and pitching the bar; and was con|fe&s;&s;ed
to be, out of &s;ight, the be&s;t
dancer at all wakes and holidays:
<PB N="57" REF="62">
happy was the country-girl who
could engage the young &s;quire as
her partner! To be &s;ure it was a
comely &s;ight for to &s;ee as how the
buxom country-la&s;&s;es, fre&s;h and fra|grant,
and blu&s;hing like the ro&s;e, in
their be&s;t apparel dight, their white
ho&s;e, and clean &s;hort dimity petti|coats,
their gaudy gowns of print|ed
cotton; their top-knots, ki&s;&s;ing-&s;trings,
and &s;tomachers, bedizened
with bunches of ribbons of various
colours, green, pink, and yellow;
to &s;ee them crowned with garlands,
and a&s;&s;embled on May-day, to dance
before &s;quire Launcelot, as he made
his morning's progre&s;s through the
village. Then all the young pea|&s;ants
made their appearance with
cockades, &s;uited to the fancies of
their &s;everal &s;weet-hearts, and boughs
of flowering hawthorn. The chil|dren
&s;ported about like flocks of
fri&s;king lambs, or the young fry
&s;warming under the &s;unny bank of
&s;ome meandering river. The old
men and women, in their holiday-garments,
<PB N="58" REF="63">
&s;tood at their doors to
receive their benefactor, and poured
forth ble&s;&s;ings on him as he pa&s;&s;ed:
the children welcomed him with
their &s;hrill &s;houts; the dam&s;els with
&s;ongs of prai&s;e; and the young men
with the pipe and tabor marched
before him to the May-pole, which
was bedecked with flowers and
bloom. There the rural dance be|gan:
a plentiful dinner, with oceans
of good liquor, was be&s;poke at the
White Hart: the whole village was
rega$ed at the &s;quire's expence; and
both the day and the night was &s;pent
in mirth and plea&s;ure. Lord help
you! he could not re&s;t if he thought
there was an aching heart in the
whole pari&s;h. Every paultry cottage
was in a little time converted into
a pretty &s;nug, comfortable habita|tion,
with a wooden porch at the
door, gla&s;s ca&s;ements in the win|dows,
and a little garden behind
well &s;tored with greens, roots, and
&s;allads. In a word, the poor's rate
was reduced to a meer trifle, and
<PB N="59" REF="64">
one would have thought the golden
age was revived in York&s;hire. But,
as I told you before, the old knight
could not bear to &s;ee his only &s;on &s;o
wholly attached to the&s;e lowly plea|&s;ures,
while he indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;hunned
all opportunities of appearing in that
&s;uperior &s;phere to which he was de|&s;igned
by nature and by fortune.
He imputed his conduct to meanne&s;s
of &s;pirit, and advi&s;ed with my father
touching the propere&s;t expedient to
wean his affections from &s;uch low-born
pur&s;uits. My father coun&s;elled him
to &s;end the young gentleman up to
London, to be entered as a &s;tudent in
the Temple, and recommended to the
&s;uperintendance of &s;ome per&s;on who
knew the town, and might engage
him in&s;en&s;ibly in &s;uch amu&s;ements
and connexions, as would &s;oon lift his
ideas above the humble objects on
which they had been hitherto em|ployed.
This advice appeared &s;o &s;a|lutary,
that it was followed with|out
the lea&s;t he&s;itation. The young
&s;quire him&s;elf was perfectly well &s;a|tisfied
<PB N="60" REF="65">
with the propo&s;al, and in a
few days &s;et out for the great city:
but there was not a dry eye in the
pari&s;h at his departure, although he
prevailed upon his father to pay in
his ab&s;ence all the pen&s;ions he had
granted to tho&s;e who could not live
on the fruit of their own indu&s;try.
In what manner he &s;pent his time at
London, it is none of my bu&s;ine&s;s to
inquire; tho&s; I know pretty well
what kind of lives are led by gem|men
of your Inns of Court.&mdash;I my|&s;elf
once belonged to Serjeant's Inn,
and was perhaps as good a wit and
a critick as any Templar of them all.
Nay, as for that matter, thof I de|&s;pi&s;e
vanity, I can aver with a &s;afe
con&s;cience, that I had once the ho|nour
to belong to the &s;ociety called
<HI>the Town:</HI> we were all of us attor|neys
clerks, gemmen, and had our
meetings at an ale-hou&s;e in Butcher|row,
where we regulated the diver|&s;ions
of the theatre.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion:
Sir Everhard Greaves did not &s;eem
<PB N="61" REF="66">
to be very well plea&s;ed with the con|duct
of his &s;on at London. He got
notice of &s;ome irregularities and &s;crapes
into which he had fallen; and the
&s;quire &s;eldom wrote to his father, ex|cept
to draw upon him for money,
which he did &s;o fa&s;t, that in eighteen
months the old gemman lo&s;t all pa|tience.</P>
<P>At this period &s;quire Darnel chanced
to die, leaving an only daughter, a
minor, heire&s;s of three thou&s;and a year,
under the guardian&s;hip of her uncle
Anthony, who&s;e brutal character all
the world knows. The breath was
no &s;ooner out of his brother's body
than he re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;uc|ceed
him in parliament as repre&s;en|tative
for the borough of A&s;henton.
Now you mu&s;t know, that this
borough had been for many years a
bone of contention between the fa|milies
of Greaves and Darnel; and at
length the difference was compro|mi&s;ed
by the interpo&s;ition of friends,
on condition that Sir Everhard and
Squire Darnel &s;hould alternately re|pre&s;ent
<PB N="62" REF="67">
the place in parliament. They
agreed to this compromi&s;e for their
mutual convenience; but they were
never heartily reconciled. Their po|litical
principles did not tally; and
their wives looked upon each other as
rivals in fortune and magnificence:
&s;o that there was no intercour&s;e be|tween
them, thof they lived in the
&s;ame neighbourhood. On the con|trary,
in all di&s;putes, they con&s;tantly
headed the oppo&s;ite parties. Sir Everhard
under&s;tanding that Anthony Dar|nel
had begun to canva&s;s, and was
putting every iron in the fire, in vio|lation
and contempt of the <HI>pactum fa|miliae</HI>
before mentioned, fell into a
violent pa&s;&s;ion, that brought on a
&s;evere fit of the gout, by which he
was di&s;abled from giving per&s;onal at|tention
to his own intere&s;t. My father,
indeed, employed all his diligence and
addre&s;s, and &s;pared neither money,
time, nor con&s;titution, till at length he
drank him&s;elf into a con&s;umption,
which was the death of him. But,
after all, there is a great difference
<PB N="63" REF="68">
between a &s;teward and a principal.
Mr. Darnel attended in <HI>propria per&s;ona,</HI>
flattered and care&s;&s;ed the women,
fea&s;ted the electors, hired mobs, made
proce&s;&s;ions, and &s;cattered about his
money in &s;uch a manner, that our
friends dur&s;t hardly &s;hew their heads
in public.</P>
<P>At this very cri&s;is our young &s;quire,
to whom his father had writ an account
of the tran&s;action, arrived unexpect|edly
at Greave&s;bury-hall, and had a
long private conference with Sir Everhard.
The news of his return &s;pread
like wild-fire thro' all that part of the
country: bonfires were made, and the
bells &s;et a ringing in &s;everal towns and
&s;teeples; and next morning above
&s;even hundred people were a&s;&s;embled
at the gate, with mu&s;ic, flags and
&s;treamers, to welcome their young
&s;quire, and accompany him to the
borough of A&s;henton. He &s;et out on
foot with this retinue, and entered
one end of the town ju&s;t as Mr. Dar|nel's
mob had come in at the other.
Both arrived about the &s;ame time at
<PB N="64" REF="69">
the market-place; but Mr. Darnel,
mounting fir&s;t into the balcony of
the town-hou&s;e, made a long &s;peech
to the people in favour of his own
preten&s;ions, not without &s;ome invi|dious
reflections glanced at Sir Everhard,
his competitor. We did not
much mind the acclamations of his
party, which we knew had been
hired for the purpo&s;e: but we were
in &s;ome pain for Mr. Greaves, who
had not been u&s;ed to &s;peak in pub|lic.
He took his turn however in
the balcony, and, uncovering his
head, bowed all round with the mo&s;t
engaging courte&s;y. He was dre&s;&s;ed
in a green frock trimmed with gold,
and his own dark hair flowed about
his ears in natural curls, while his
face was over&s;pread with a blu&s;h,
that improved the glow of youth to
a deeper crim&s;on, and I dare &s;ay &s;et
many a female heart a palpitating.
When he made his fir&s;t appearance,
there was ju&s;t &s;uch a humming and
clapping of hands as you may have
heard when the celebrated Garrick
<PB N="65" REF="70">
comes upon the &s;tage in King Lear,
or King Richard, or any other top
character. But how agreeably were
we di&s;appointed, when our young
gentleman made &s;uch an oration as
would not have di&s;graced a Pitt, an
Egmont, or a Murray! While he
&s;poke, all was hu&s;hed in admiration
and attention&mdash;you could have al|mo&s;t
heard a feather drop to the
ground. It would have charmed
you to hear with what mode&s;ty he
recounted the &s;ervices which his fa|ther
and grandfather had done to
the corporation; with what eloquence
he expatiated upon the &s;hameful in|fraction
of the treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween
the two families; and with
what keen and &s;pirited &s;trokes of &s;atire
he retorted the &s;arca&s;ms of Darnel.
He no &s;ooner concluded his harangue,
than there was &s;uch a bur&s;t of applau&s;e
as &s;eemed to rend the very &s;ky. Our
mu&s;ick immediately &s;truck up; our
people advanced with their en&s;igns,
and, as every man had a good cud|gel,
broken heads would have en|&s;ued,
<PB N="66" REF="71">
had not Mr. Darnel and his
party thought proper to retreat with
uncommon di&s;patch. He never of|fered
to make another public en|trance,
as he &s;aw the torrent ran &s;o
violently again&s;t him; but &s;at down
with his lo&s;s, and withdrew his op|po&s;ition,
though at bottom extreme|ly
mortified and incen&s;ed. Sir Ever|hard
was unanimou&s;ly elected, and
appeared to be the happie&s;t man
upon earth; for, be&s;ides the plea|&s;ure
ari&s;ing from his victory over this
competitor, he was now fully &s;atisfied
that his &s;on, in&s;tead of di&s;gracing,
would do honour to his family. It
would have moved a heart of &s;tone,
to &s;ee with what a tender tran&s;port
of paternal joy he received his dear
Launcelot, after having heard of his
deportment and &s;ucce&s;s at A&s;henton;
where, by the bye, he gave a ball to
the ladies, and di&s;played as much ele|gance
and politene&s;s as if he had been
bred at the court of Ver&s;ailles.</P>
<P>This joyous &s;ea&s;on was of &s;hort
duration: in a little time all the hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="67" REF="72">
of the family was overca&s;t by
a &s;ad incident, which hath left &s;uch
an unfortunate impre&s;&s;ion upon the
mind of the young gentleman, as, I
am afraid, will never be effaced.
Mr. Darnel's niece and ward, the
great heire&s;s, who&s;e name is Aurelia,
was the mo&s;t celebrated beauty of the
whole country&mdash;if I &s;aid the whole
kingdom, or indeed all Europe, per|haps
I &s;hould barely do her ju&s;tice.
I don't pretend to be a limner, gem|men;
nor does it become me to de|lineate
&s;uch excellence: but &s;urely I
may pre&s;ume to repeat from the play;
<Q><L>&startq;O! &s;he is all that painting can
expre&s;s,</L>
<L>&startq;Or youthful poets fancy when
they love!</L></Q></P>
<P>At that time &s;he might be about
&s;eventeen, tall and fair, and &s;o ex|qui&s;itely
&s;haped&mdash;you may talk of
your Venus de Medicis, your Dianas,
your Nymphs, and Galateas; but if
Praxiteles, and Roubillac, and Wil|ton,
<PB N="68" REF="73">
were to lay their heads toge|ther,
in order to make a complete
pattern of beauty, they would hard|ly
reach her model of perfection.&mdash;As
for complexion, poets will talk
of blending the lily with the ro&s;e,
and bring in a parcel of &s;imiles of
cow&s;lips, carnations, pinks, and dai|&s;ies.&mdash;There's
Dolly, now, has got
a very good complexion:&mdash;indeed,
&s;he's the very picture of health and
innocence.&mdash;You are, indeed, my
pretty la&s;s;&mdash;but <HI>parva componere
magnis.</HI>&mdash;Mi&s;s Darnel is all amaz|ing
beauty, delicacy, and dignity!
Then the &s;oftne&s;s and expre&s;&s;ion of
her fine blue eyes; her pouting lips
of coral hue; her neck, that ri&s;es
like a tower of poli&s;hed alaba&s;ter be|tween
two mounts of &s;now.&mdash;I tell
you what, gemmen, it don't &s;ignify
talking: if e'er a one of you was to
meet this young lady alone, in the
mid&s;t of a heath or common, or any
unfrequented place, he would down
on his knees, and think he kneeled
before &s;ome &s;upernatural being. I'll
<PB N="69" REF="74">
tell you more: &s;he not only re&s;em|bles
an angel in beauty, but a &s;aint in
goodne&s;s, and an hermit in humi|lity;&mdash;&s;o
void of all pride and af|fectation;
&s;o &s;oft, and &s;weet, and af|fable,
and humane! Lord! I could
tell &s;uch in&s;tances of her charity!&mdash;Sure
enough, &s;he and Sir Launcelot
were formed by nature for each other:
how&s;oever, the cruel hand of fortune
hath intervened, and &s;evered them for
ever. Every &s;oul that knew them
both, &s;aid it was a thou&s;and pities but
they &s;hould come together, and ex|tingui&s;h
in their happy union the mu|tual
animo&s;ity of the two families,
which had &s;o often embroiled the
whole neighbourhood. Nothing was
heard but the prai&s;es of mi&s;s Aurelia
Darnel and Mr. Launcelot Greaves;
and no doubt the parties were prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed,
by this applau&s;e, in favour of
each other. At length, Mr. Greaves
went one Sunday to her pari&s;h-church;
but, though the greater part of the
congregation watched their looks,
they could not perceive that &s;he took
<PB N="70" REF="75">
lea&s;t notice of him; or that he &s;eemed
to be &s;truck with her appearance.
He afterwards had an opportunity of
&s;eeing her, more at lei&s;ure, at the
York-a&s;&s;embly, during the races; but
this opportunity was productive of
no good effect, becau&s;e he had that
&s;ame day quarrelled with her uncle
on the turf.&mdash;An old grudge, you
know, gemmen, is &s;oon inflamed to
a fre&s;h rupture. It was thought Mr.
Darnel came on purpo&s;e to &s;hew his
re&s;entment. They differed about a
bet upon Mi&s;s Cleverlegs, and, in the
cour&s;e of the di&s;pute, Mr. Darnel cal|led
him a petulant boy. The young
&s;quire, who was as ha&s;ty as gunpow|der,
told him he was man enough
to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his in&s;olence;
and would do it on the &s;pot, if he
thought it would not interrupt the di|ver&s;ion.
In all probability they would
have come to points immediately, had
not the gentlemen interpo&s;ed; &s;o that
nothing further pa&s;&s;ed, but abun|dance
of foul language on the part of
<PB N="71" REF="76">
Mr. Anthony, and a repeated defiance
to &s;ingle combat.</P>
<P>Mr. Greaves, making a low bow,
retired from the field; and in the
evening danced at the a&s;&s;embly with
a young lady from the Bi&s;hoprick,
&s;eemingly in good temper and &s;pi|rits,
without having any words with
Mr. Darnel, who was al&s;o pre&s;ent.
But in the morning he vi&s;ited that
proud neighbour betimes; and they
had almo&s;t reached a grove of trees
on the north-&s;ide of the town, when
they were &s;uddenly overtaken by
half a dozen gentlemen, who had
watched their motions. It was in
vain for them to di&s;&s;emble their de|&s;ign,
which could not now take ef|fect.
They gave up their pi&s;tols,
and a reconciliation was patched up
by the pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;trances of their
common friends; but Mr. Darnel's
hatred &s;till rankled at bottom, and
&s;oon broke out in the &s;equel. About
three months after this tran&s;action, his
niece Aurelia, with her mother, hav|ing
<PB N="72" REF="77">
been to vi&s;it a lady in the chariot,
the hor&s;es being young, and not u&s;ed
to the traces, were &s;tartled at the bray|ing
of a jack-a&s;s on the common, and
taking fright, ran away with the car|riage
like lightning. The coachman
was thrown from the box, and the la|dies
&s;creamed piteou&s;ly for help. Mr.
Greaves chanced to be a hor&s;e-back
on the other &s;ide of an inclo&s;ure,
when he heard their &s;hrieks; and
riding up to the hedge, knew the
chariot, and &s;aw their di&s;after. The
hor&s;es were then running full &s;peed
in &s;uch a direction, as to drive head|long
over a precipice into a &s;tone-quarry,
where they and the chariot,
and the ladies, mu&s;t be da&s;hed in
pieces. You may conceive, gem|men,
what his thoughts were when
he &s;aw &s;uch a fine young lady, in
the flower of her age, ju&s;t plunging
into eternity; when he &s;aw the love|ly
Aurelia on the brink of being pre|cipitated
among rocks, where her de|licate
limbs mu&s;t be mangled and
tore a&s;under; when he perceived that,
<PB N="73" REF="78">
before he could ride round by the gate,
the tragedy would be fini&s;hed. The
fence was &s;o thick and high, flanked
with a broad ditch on the out&s;ide, that
he could not hope to clear it, although
he was mounted on <HI>Scipio,</HI> bred out
of Mi&s;s <HI>Cow&s;lip,</HI> the &s;ire <HI>Muley,</HI> and
his <HI>grand&s;ire</HI> the famous Arabian <HI>Mu|&s;tapha.&mdash;Scipio</HI>
was bred by my father,
who would not have taken a hundred
guineas for him from any other per&s;on
but the young &s;quire.&mdash;Indeed, I
have heard my poor father &s;ay&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>By this time Ferret's impatience was
become &s;o outrageous, that he exclaim|ed
in a furious tone, &startq;Damn your fa|ther,
and his hor&s;e, and his colt into
the bargain!&endq;</P>
<P>Tom made no reply; but began
to &s;trip with great expedition. Cap|tain
Crowe was &s;o choaked with pa&s;|&s;ion,
that he could utter nothing but
disjointed &s;entences: he ro&s;e from his
&s;eat, brandi&s;hed his hor&s;ewhip, and
&s;eizing his nephew by the collar, cried,
&startq;Odd's heartlikins! &s;irrah, I have a
good mind&mdash;Devil fire your running
<PB N="74" REF="79">
tackle, you land-lubber!&mdash;can't you
&s;teer without all this tacking hither
and thither, and the Lord knows whi|ther?&mdash;'Noint
my block! I'd give
thee a rope's end for thy &s;upper, if it
wan't&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Dolly had conceived a &s;neaking
kindne&s;s for the young lawyer, and
thinking him in danger of being
roughly handled, flew to his relief.
She twi&s;ted her hand in Crowe's
neckcloth without ceremony, crying,
&startq;Sha't then, I tell thee, old coger.&mdash;Who
kears a vig vor thy $ooli&s;h
trantrums?&endq;</P>
<P>While Crowe looked black in the
face, and ran the ri&s;que of &s;trangu|lation
under the gripe of this amazon,
Mr. Clarke having di&s;engaged him|&s;elf
of his hat, wig, coat, and wai&s;t|coat,
advanced in an elegant attitude
of manual offence towards the mi&s;an|thrope,
who &s;natched up a gridiron
from the chimney-corner, and Di&s;|cord
&s;eemed to clap her &s;ooty wings
in expectation of battle.&mdash;But as the

a &s;cene or &s;tage of &s;anguinary di&s;pute,
had not Pallas or Di&s;cretion interpo&s;ed
in the per&s;on of Mr. Fillet, and with
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the ho&s;tler di&s;armed
the combatants not only of their
arms, but al&s;o of their re&s;entment.
The impetuo&s;ity of Mr. Clarke was
a little checked at &s;ight of the grid|iron,
which Ferret brandi&s;hed with
uncommon dexterity; a circum&s;tance
from whence the company were,
upon reflexion, induced to believe,
<PB N="76" REF="81">
that before he plunged into the &s;ea
of politicks, he had occa&s;ionally fi|gured
in the character of that facetious
droll, who accompanies your itinerant
phy&s;icians, under the familiar appel|lation
of Merry-Andrew, or Jack-Pudding,
and on a wooden &s;tage en|tertains
the populace with a &s;olo on
the &s;alt-box, or a &s;onnata on the tongs
and gridiron. Be that as it may, the
young lawyer &s;eemed to be a little di&s;|compo&s;ed
at the glancing of this ex|traordinary
weapon of offence, which
the fair hands of Dolly had &s;coured,
until it &s;hone as bright as the &s;hield of
Achilles; or as the emblem of good
old Engli&s;h fare, which hangs by a
red ribbon round the neck of that
thrice-honoured &s;age's head, in vel|vet
bonnet ca&s;ed, who pre&s;ides by
rotation at the genial board, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the title of the <HI>Beef-&s;take
Club:</HI> where the delicate rumps ir|re&s;i&s;tibly
attract the &s;tranger's eye,
and, while they &s;eem to cry &startq;Come
cut me&mdash;come cut me,&endq; con&s;train,
by wondrous &s;ympathy, each mouth
<PB N="77" REF="82">
to overflow: where the obliging and
humorous Jemmy B&mdash;t, the gen|tle
Billy H&mdash;d, replete with hu|man
kindne&s;s, and the generous
Johnny B&mdash;d, re&s;pected and be|loved
by all the world, attend as the
prie&s;ts and mini&s;ters of Mirth, good
Cheer, and Jollity, and a&s;&s;i&s;t with
culinary art the raw, unpracti&s;ed,
aukward gue&s;t.</P>
<P>But, to return from this digre&s;&s;ive
&s;imile: the ho&s;tler no &s;ooner &s;tept
between tho&s;e menacing antagoni&s;ts
than Tom Clarke very quietly re|&s;umed
his cloaths, and Mr. Ferret
re&s;igned the gridiron without further
que&s;tion. The doctor did not find it
quite &s;o ea&s;y to relea&s;e the throat of
Capt. Crowe from the ma&s;culine gra&s;p
of the virago Dolly, who&s;e fingers
could not be di&s;engaged until the ho|ne&s;t
&s;eaman was almo&s;t at the la&s;t ga&s;p.
After &s;ome pau&s;e, during which he
panted for breath, and untied his neck|cloth,
&startq;Damn thee, for a brim&s;tone
galley (cried he); I was never &s;o grap|pled
withal &s;ince I knew a card from
<PB N="78" REF="83">
a compa&s;s.&mdash;Adzooks! the jade
has &s;o taughtened my rigging, d'ye
&s;ee, that I&mdash;Snatch my bowlings,
if I come athwart thy haw&s;er, I'll
turn thy keel upwards&mdash;or mayhap
&s;et thee a-driving under thy bare
poles&mdash;I will&mdash;I will, you hell-fire,
&s;aucy&mdash;I will.&endq;</P>
<P>Do'ly made no reply; but &s;eeing
Mr. Clarke &s;it down again with great
compo&s;ure, took her &s;tation likewi&s;e
at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the apartment.
Then Mr. Fillet reque&s;ted the lawyer
to proceed with his &s;tory, which, af|ter
three hems, he accordingly pro|&s;ecuted
in the&s;e words.</P>
<P>&startq;I told you, gemmen, that Mr.
Greaves was mounted on Scipio,
when he &s;aw mi&s;s Darnel and her
mother in danger of being hurried
over a precipice. Without reflect|ing
a moment he gave Scipio the
&s;pur, and at one &s;pring he cleared
five and twenty feet, over hedge and
ditch, and every ob&s;truction. Then
he rode full &s;peed, in order to turn
the coach-hor&s;es; and, finding them
<PB N="79" REF="84">
quite wild and furious, endeavoured
to drive again&s;t the counter of the
hither hor&s;e, which he mi&s;&s;ed, and
&s;taked poor Scipio on the pole of
the coach. The &s;hock was &s;o great,
that the coach-hor&s;es made a full
&s;top within ten yards of the quarry,
and Mr. Greaves was thrown for|wards
towards the coach-box, which
mounting with admirable dexterity,
he &s;eized the reins before the hor&s;es
could recover of their fright. At
that in&s;tant the coachman came run|ning
up, and loo&s;ed them from the
traces with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch. Mr.
Greaves had now time to give his
attention to the ladies, who were
well nigh di&s;tracted with fear. He
no &s;ooner opened the chariot-door
than Aurelia, with a wildne&s;s of look,
&s;prung into his arms; and, cla&s;ping
him round the neck, fainted away.
I leave you to gue&s;s, gemmen, what
were his feelings at this in&s;tant. The
mother was not &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed, but
that &s;he could contribute to the reco|very
of her daughter, whom the young
<PB N="80" REF="85">
&s;quire &s;till &s;upported in his embrace.
At length &s;he retrieved the u&s;e of her
&s;en&s;es, and perceiving the &s;ituation in
which &s;he was, the blood revi&s;ited her
face with a redoubled glow, while &s;he
de&s;ired him to &s;et her down upon the
turf.</P>
<P>&startq;Mrs. Darnel, far from being
&s;hy or re&s;erved in her compliments
of acknowledgments, ki&s;&s;ed Mr.
Launcelot without ceremony, the
tears of gratitude running down her
cheeks: &s;he called him her dear &s;on,
her generous deliverer, who, at the
hazard of his own life, had &s;aved her
and her child from the mo&s;t di&s;mal
fate that could be imagined. Mr.
Greaves was &s;o much tran&s;ported on
this occa&s;ion, that he could not help
di&s;clo&s;ing a pa&s;&s;ion, which he had hi|therto
indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed. &startq;What
I have done (&s;aid he) was but a com|mon
office of humanity, which I
would have performed for any of my
fellow-creatures: but, for the pre&s;er|vation
of mi&s;s Aurelia Darnel, I would
at any time &s;acrifice my life with plea|&s;ure.&endq;
<PB N="81" REF="86">
The young lady did not hear
this declaration unmoved: her face was
again flu&s;hed, and her eyes &s;parkled
with plea&s;ure: nor was the youth's
confe&s;&s;ion di&s;agreeable to the good
lady her mother, who at one glance
perceived all the advantages of &s;uch
an union between the two families.</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Greaves propo&s;ed to &s;end the
coachman to his father's &s;table for
a pair of &s;ober hor&s;es, that could be
depended upon, to draw the ladies
home to their own habitation; but
they declined the offer, and cho&s;e to
walk, as the di&s;tance was not great.
He then in&s;i&s;ted upon his being their
conductor; and, each taking him
under the arm, &s;upported them to
their own gate, where &s;uch an ap|parition
filled all the dome&s;tics with
a&s;toni&s;hment. Mrs. Darnel, taking
him by the hand, led him into the
hou&s;e, where &s;he welcomed him with
another affectionate embrace, and in|dulged
him with an ambro&s;ial ki&s;s
of Aurelia, &s;aying, &startq;But for you,
we had both been by this time in
<PB N="82" REF="87">
eternity.&mdash;Sure it was heaven that
&s;ent you as an angel to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance!&endq;
She kindly inquired if he had him|&s;elf
&s;u&s;tained any damage in admini|&s;tring
that de&s;perate remedy to which
they owed their lives. She enter|tained
him with a &s;mall collation;
and, in the cour&s;e of the conver&s;a|tion,
lamented the animo&s;ity which
had &s;o long divided two neighbouring
families of &s;uch influence and cha|racter.
He was not &s;low in &s;ignifying
his approbation of her remarks, and
expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t eager de&s;ire of
&s;eeing all tho&s;e unhappy differences re|moved:
in a word, they parted with
mutual &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>&startq;Ju&s;t as he advanced from the out|ward
gate, on his return to Greave&s;|bury-hall,
he was met by Anthony
Darnel on hor&s;eback, who riding up
to him with marks of &s;urprize and re|&s;entment,
&s;aluted him with &startq;Your
&s;ervant, Sir.&mdash;Have you any com|mands
for me?&endq; The other reply|ing
with an air of indifference, &startq;None
at all,&endq; Mr. Darnel a&s;ked, what had
<PB N="83" REF="88">
procured him the honour of a vi&s;it. The
young gentleman, perceiving by the
manner in which he &s;poke that the
old quarrel was not yet extingui&s;hed,
an&s;wered, with equal di&s;dain, that
the vi&s;it was not intended for him;
and that, if he wanted to know the
cau&s;e of it, he might inform him&s;elf
by his own &s;ervants. &startq;So I &s;hall
(cried the uncle of Aurelia); and per|haps
let you know my &s;entiments of
the matter&mdash;&endq; &startq;Hereafter as it may
be,&endq; &s;aid the youth; who, turning
out of the avenue, walked home, and
made his father acquainted with the
particulars of this adventure.</P>
<P>&startq;The old gentleman chid him for
his ra&s;hne&s;s; but &s;eemed plea&s;ed with
the &s;ucce&s;s of his attempt, and &s;till
more &s;o, when he under&s;tood his &s;en|timents
of Aurelia, and the deport|ment
of the ladies.</P>
<P>&startq;Next day the &s;on &s;ent over a &s;er|vant
with a compliment, to enquire
about their health; and the me&s;&s;en|ger,
being &s;een by Mr. Darnel, was
told that the ladies were indi&s;po&s;ed,
<PB N="84" REF="89">
and did not chu&s;e to be troubled
with me&s;&s;ages. The mother was
really &s;eized with a fever, produced
by the agitation of her &s;pirits, which
every day became more and more
violent, until the phy&s;icians de&s;paired
of her life. Believing that her end
approached, &s;he &s;ent a tru&s;ty &s;ervant
to Mr. Greaves, de&s;iring that &s;he
might &s;ee him without delay; and
he immediately &s;et out with the me&s;|&s;enger,
who introduced him in the
dark. He found the old lady in
bed, almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, and the fair
Aurelia &s;itting by her, overwhelmed
with grief, her lovely hair in the ut|mo&s;t
di&s;order, and her charming eyes
inflamed with weeping. The good
lady beckoning Mr. Launcelot to ap|proach,
and directing all the atten|dants
to quit the room, except a fa|vourite
maid, from whom I learned
the &s;tory, &s;he took him by the hand,
and fixing her eyes upon him with all
the fondne&s;s of a mother, &s;hed &s;ome
tears, in &s;ilence, while the &s;ame marks
of &s;orrow trickled down his cheeks.
<PB N="85" REF="90">
After this affecting pau&s;e, &startq;My dear
&s;on (&s;aid &s;he), Oh! that I could have
lived to &s;ee you &s;o indeed! you find me
ha&s;tening to the goal of life&endq;&mdash;Here
the tender-hearted Aurelia, being un|able
to contain her&s;elf longer, broke
out into a violent pa&s;&s;ion of grief, and
wept aloud. The mother, waiting
patiently till &s;he had thus given vent
to her angui&s;h, calmly intreated her
to re&s;ign her&s;elf &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively to the
will of heaven: then turning to Mr.
Launcelot, &startq;I had indulged (&s;aid &s;he)
a fond hope of &s;eeing you allied to my
family.&mdash;This is no time for me to
in&s;i&s;t upon the ceremonies and forms
of a vain world.&mdash;Aurelia looks up|on
you with the eyes of tender pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&endq;
No &s;ooner had &s;he pro|nounced
the&s;e words than he threw
him&s;elf on his knees before the young
lady, and, pre&s;&s;ing her hand to his
lips, breathed the &s;ofte&s;t expre&s;&s;ions
which the mo&s;t delicate love could
&s;ugge&s;t. &startq;I know (re&s;umed the
mother) that your pa&s;&s;ion is mutual|ly
&s;incere; and I &s;hould die &s;atisfied,
<PB N="86" REF="91">
if I thought your union would not be
oppo&s;ed: but that violent man, my
brother-in-law, who is Aurelia's &s;ole
guardian, will thwart her wi&s;hes with
every ob&s;tacle that brutal re&s;entment
and implacable malice can contrive.
Mr. Greaves, I have long admired
your virtues, and am confident that I
can depend upon your honour.&mdash;
You &s;hall give me your word, that,
when I am gone, you will take no
&s;teps in this affair without the con|currence
of your father; and endea|vour,
by all fair and honourable
means, to vanqui&s;h the prejudices,
and obtain the con&s;ent of her uncle:
the re&s;t we mu&s;t leave to the di&s;pen|&s;ation
of Providence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;quire promi&s;ed, in the mo&s;t
&s;olemn and fervent manner, to obey
all her injunctions, as the la&s;t dictates
of a parent whom he &s;hould never
cea&s;e to honour. Then &s;he favoured
them both with a great deal of &s;aluta|ry
advice, touching their conduct be|fore
and after marriage; and pre&s;ented
him with a ring, as a memorial of her
<PB N="87" REF="92">
affection: at the &s;ame time he pulled
another off his finger, and made a ten|der
of it as a pledge of his love to Au|relia,
whom her mother permitted to
receive this token. Finally, he took
a la&s;t farewel of the good matron, and
returned to his father with the parti|culars
of this interview.</P>
<P>&startq;In two days Mrs. Darnel departed
this life, and Aurelia was removed to
the hou&s;e of a relation, where her
grief had like to have proved fatal to
her con&s;titution.</P>
<P>&startq;In the mean time, the mother
was no &s;ooner committed to the earth
than Mr. Greaves, mindful of her ex|hortations,
began to take mea&s;ures for
a reconciliation with the guardian. He
engaged &s;everal gentlemen to inter|po&s;e
their good offices; but they al|ways
met with the mo&s;t mortifying
repul&s;e: and at la&s;t Anthony Darnel
declared, that his hatred to the hou&s;e
of Greaves was hereditary, habitual,
and unconquerable. He &s;wore he
would &s;pend his heart's blood to per|petuate
the quarrel; and that, &s;ooner
<PB N="88" REF="93">
than his niece &s;hould match with
young Launcelot, he would &s;acrifice
her with his own hand. The young
gentleman, finding his prejudice &s;o
rancorous and invincible, left off
making any further advances; and,
&s;ince he found it impo&s;&s;ible to obtain
his con&s;ent, re&s;olved to cultivate the
good graces of Aurelia, and wed her
in de&s;pite of her implacable guardian.
He found means to e&s;tabli&s;h a literary
corre&s;pondence with her, as &s;oon as
her grief was a little abated; and even
to effect an interview, after her return
to her own hou&s;e: but he &s;oon had
rea&s;on to repent of this indulgence.
The uncle entertained &s;pies upon the
young lady, who gave him an account
of this meeting; in con&s;equence of
which &s;he was &s;uddenly hurried to
&s;ome di&s;tant part of the country, which
we never could di&s;cover.</P>
<P>&startq;It was then we thought Mr.
Launcelot a little di&s;ordered in his
brain, his grief was &s;o wild, and his
pa&s;&s;ion &s;o impetuous. He refu&s;ed all
&s;u&s;tenance, neglected his per&s;on, re|nounced
<PB N="89" REF="94">
his amu&s;ements, rode out in
the rain, &s;ometimes bare headed,
&s;trolled about the fields all night, and
became &s;o peevi&s;h, that none of the
dome&s;ticks dur&s;t &s;peak to him, with|out
the hazard of broken bones.
Having played the&s;e pranks for about
three weeks, to the un&s;peakable cha|grin
of his father, and the a&s;toni&s;h|ment
of all that knew him, he &s;ud|denly
grew calm, and his good hu|mour
returned. But this, as your
&s;ea-faring people &s;ay, was a deceitful
calm, that &s;oon u&s;hered in a dread|ful
&s;torm.</P>
<P>&startq;He had long &s;ought an opportu|nity
to tamper with &s;ome of Mr. Dar|nel's
&s;ervants, who could inform him
of the place where Aurelia was con|fined;
but there was not one about the
family who could give him that &s;atis|faction:
for the per&s;ons who accom|panied
her, remained as a watch up|on
her motions, and none of the other
dome&s;tics were privy to the tran&s;action.
All attempts proving fruitle&s;s, he could
no longer re&s;tain his impatience; but
<PB N="90" REF="95">
throwing him&s;elf in the way of the
uncle, upbraided him in &s;uch har&s;h
terms, that a formal challenge en&s;ued.
They agreed to decide their diffe|rence
without witne&s;&s;es; and one
morning, before &s;un-ri&s;e, met on that
very common where Mr. Greaves had
&s;aved the life of Aurelia. The fir&s;t
pi&s;tol was fired on each &s;ide without
any effect; but Mr. Darnel's &s;econd
wounded the young &s;quire in the
flank: neverthele&s;s, having a pi&s;tol in
re&s;erve, he de&s;ired his antagoni&s;t to
a&s;k his life. The other, in&s;tead of
&s;ubmitting, drew his &s;word; and Mr.
Greaves, firing his piece into the air,
followed his example. The conte&s;t
then became very hot, tho' of &s;hort
continuance. Darnel being di&s;armed
at the fir&s;t on&s;et, our young &s;quire gave
him back the &s;word, which he was
ba&s;e enough to u&s;e a &s;econd time
again&s;t his conqueror. Such an in|&s;tance
of repeated ingratitude and bru|tal
ferocity dive&s;ted Mr. Greaves of
his temper and forbearance. He at|tacked
Mr. Anthony with great fury,
<PB N="91" REF="96">
and at the fir&s;t longe ran him up to
the hilt, at the &s;ame time &s;eizing with
his left hand the &s;hell of his enemy's
&s;word, which he broke in di&s;dain.
Mr. Darnel having fallen, the other
immediately mounted his hor&s;e, which
he had tied to a tree before the en|gagement;
and riding full &s;peed to
A&s;henton, &s;ent a &s;urgeon to Antho|ny's
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He afterwards inge|nuou&s;ly
confe&s;&s;ed all the&s;e particulars
to his father, who was overwhelmed
with con&s;ternation, for the wounds of
Darnel were judged mortal; and as
no per&s;on had &s;een the particulars of
the duel, Mr. Launcelot might have
been convicted of murder.</P>
<P>&startq;On the&s;e con&s;iderations, before a
warrant could be &s;erved upon him,
the old knight, by dint of the mo&s;t
eager intreaties, accompanied with
marks of horror and de&s;pair, prevailed
upon his &s;on to withdraw him&s;elf from
the kingdom, until &s;uch time as the
&s;torm &s;hould be overblown. Had his
heart been unengaged, he would have
cho&s;e to travel; but at this period,
<PB N="92" REF="97">
when his whole &s;oul was engro&s;&s;ed
and &s;o violently agitated by his pa&s;&s;ion
for Aurelia, nothing but the fear of
&s;eeing the old gentleman run di&s;trac|ted,
would have induced him to de&s;i&s;t
from the pur&s;uit of that young lady
far le&s;s quit the kingdom where &s;he,
re&s;ided. Well then, gemmen, he
repaired to Harwich, where he em|barked
for Holland, from whence he
proceeded to Bru&s;&s;els, where he pro|cured
a pa&s;s-port from the French
king, by virtue of which he travelled
to Mar&s;eilles, and there took a tartan
for Genoa. The fir&s;t letter &s;ir Ever|hard
received from him was dated at
Florence. Mean while the &s;urgeon's
progno&s;tic was not altogether verified.
Mr. Darnel did not die immediately
of his wounds; but he lingered a long
time, as it were in the arms of death,
and even partly recovered: yet, in all
probability, he will never be wholly re|&s;tored
to the enjoyment of his health;
and is obliged every &s;ummer to attend
the hot well at Bri&s;tol. As his wounds
began to heal, his hatred to Mr.
<PB N="93" REF="98">
Greaves &s;eemed to revive with aug|mented
violence; and he is now, if
po&s;&s;ible, more than ever determined
again&s;t all reconciliation. Mr. Laun|celot,
after having endeavoured to
amu&s;e his imagination with a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of curious objects, in a tour of
Italy, took up his re&s;idence at a town
called Pi&s;a, and there fell into a deep
melancholy, from which nothing could
rou&s;e him but the news of his fa|ther's
death.</P>
<P>&startq;The old gentleman (God re&s;t his
&s;oul) never held up his head after the
departure of his darling Launcelot;
and the dangerous condition of Dar|nel
kept up his apprehen&s;ion: this
was reinforced by the ob&s;tinate &s;ilence
of the youth, and certain accounts of
his di&s;ordered mind, which he had re|ceived
from &s;ome of tho&s;e per&s;ons who
take plea&s;ure in communicating di&s;a|greeable
tidings. A complication of
all the&s;e grievances, co-operating with
a &s;evere $it of the gout and gravel,
produced a fever, which in a few days
brought &s;ir Everhard to his long home;
<PB N="94" REF="99">
after he had &s;ettled his affairs with
heaven and earth, and made his peace
with God and man. I'll a&s;&s;ure you,
gemmen, he made a mo&s;t edifying
and chri&s;tian end: he died regretted
by all his neighbours except Anthony,
and might be &s;aid to be embalmed by
the tears of the poor, to whom he was
always a bounteous benefactor.</P>
<P>&startq;When the &s;on, now &s;ir Launce|lot,
came home, he appeared &s;o mea|gre,
wan, and hollow-eyed, that the
&s;ervants hardly knew their young ma&s;|ter.
His fir&s;t care was to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of his fortune, and &s;ettle accounts
with the &s;teward who had &s;ucceeded
my father. The&s;e affairs being di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed,
he &s;pared no pains to get in|telligence
concerning mi&s;s Darnel;
and &s;oon learned more of that young
lady than he de&s;ired to know; for it
was become the common talk of the
country, that a match was agreed up|on
between her and young &s;quire Sy|camore,
a gentleman of a very great
fortune. The&s;e tidings were pro|bably
confirmed under her own hand,
<PB N="95" REF="100">
in a letter which &s;he wrote to &s;ir
Launcelot. The contents were never
exactly known but to the parties them|&s;elves:
neverthele&s;s, the effects were
too vi&s;ible; for, from that ble&s;&s;ed mo|ment,
he &s;poke not one word to any
living creature for the &s;pace of three
days: but was &s;een &s;ometimes to &s;hed
a flood of tears, and &s;ometimes to bur&s;t
out into a fit of laughing. At la&s;t he
broke &s;ilence, and &s;eemed to wake
from his di&s;order. He became more
fond than ever of the exerci&s;e of
riding, and began to amu&s;e him&s;elf
again with acts of benevolence. One
in&s;tance of his genero&s;ity and ju&s;tice
de&s;erves to be recorded in bra&s;s or
marble: you mu&s;t know, gemmen,
the rector of the pari&s;h was lately
dead, and &s;ir Everhard had promi&s;ed
the pre&s;entation to another clergyman.
In the mean time, &s;ir Launcelot
chancing one Sunday to ride through
a lane, perceived a hor&s;e &s;addled and
bridled feeding on the &s;ide of a fence;
and ca&s;ting his eyes around, beheld
on the other &s;ide of the hedge an ob|ject
<PB N="96" REF="101">
lying extended on the ground,
which he took to be the body of a
murdered traveller. He forthwith
alighted; and, leaping into the field,
de&s;cried a man at full length wrapped
in a great coat, and writhing in ago|ny.
Approaching nearer, he found
it was a clergyman, in his gown and
ca&s;&s;ock. When he inquired into the
ca&s;e, and offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the
&s;tranger ro&s;e up, thanked him for his
courte&s;y, and declared that he was
now very well. The knight, who
thought there was &s;omething my&s;te|rious
in this incident, expre&s;&s;ed a de|&s;ire
to know the cau&s;e of his rolling in
the gra&s;s in that manner; and the
clergyman, who knew his per&s;on,
made no &s;cruple in gratifying his cu|rio&s;ity.
&startq;You mu&s;t know, &s;ir, &s;aid
he, I &s;erve the curacy of your own
pari&s;h, for which the late incumbent
payed me twenty pounds a year; but
this &s;um being &s;carce &s;ufficient to
maintain my wife and children, who
are five in number, I agreed to read
prayers in the afternoon at another
<PB N="97" REF="102">
church about four miles from hence;
and for this additional duty I receive
ten pounds more: as I keep a hor&s;e,
it was formerly an agreeable exerci&s;e
rather than a toil; but of late years I
have been afflicted with a rupture, for
which I con&s;ulted the mo&s;t eminent
operators in the kingdom; but I have
no cau&s;e to rejoice in the effects of
their advice, though one of them a&s;|&s;ured
me I was completely cured.
The malady is now more trouble&s;ome
than ever, and often comes upon me
&s;o violently while I am on hor&s;eback,
that I am forced to alight, and lie
down upon the ground, until the cau&s;e
of the di&s;order can for the time be re|duced.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot not only condoled
with him upon his misfortune, but de|&s;ired
him to throw up the &s;econd cure,
and he would pay him ten pounds a
year out of his own pocket. Your
genero&s;ity confounds me, good &s;ir:
(cried the clergyman) and yet I ought
not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at any in&s;tance of
benevolence in &s;ir Launcelot Greaves;
<PB N="98" REF="103">
but I will check the fulne&s;s of my
heart. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that your
good intention towards me can hard|ly
take effect. The gentleman, who
is to &s;ucceed the late incumbent, has
given me notice to quit the premi&s;es,
as he hath provided a friend of his
own for the curacy.&endq; &startq;What! (cried
the knight) does he mean to take your
bread from you, without a&s;&s;igning any
other rea&s;on?&endq; &startq;Surely, &s;ir, replied
the eccle&s;ia&s;tic, I know of no other
rea&s;on. I hope my morals are irre|proachable,
and that I have done my
duty with a con&s;cientious regard: I
may venture an appeal to the pari&s;hi|oners
among whom I have lived the&s;e
&s;eventeen years. After all, it is na|tural
for every man to favour his own
friends in preference to &s;trangers. As
for me, I propo&s;e to try my fortune
in the great city; and I doubt not but
providence will provide for me and
my little ones.&endq; To this declaration
Sir Launcelot made no reply; but ri|ding
home &s;et on foot a &s;trict enquiry
into the character of this man, who&s;e
<PB N="99" REF="104">
name was Jenkins. He found that
he was a reputed &s;cholar, equally re|markable
for his mode&s;ty and good
life; that he vi&s;ited the &s;ick, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
the needy, compromi&s;ed di&s;putes a|mong
his neighbours, and &s;pent his
time in &s;uch a manner as would have
done honour to any chri&s;tian divine.
Thus informed, the knight &s;ent for
the gentleman to whom the living
had been promi&s;ed, and acco&s;ted him
to this effect: &startq;Mr. Tootle, I have
a favour to a&s;k of you. The per&s;on
who &s;erves the cure of this pari&s;h, is
a man of good character, beloved by
the people, and has a large family. I
&s;hall be obliged to you if you will
continue him in the curacy.&endq; The
other told him he was &s;orry he could
not comply with his reque&s;t, being
that he had already promi&s;ed the cu|racy
to a friend of his own.&endq; &startq;No
matter: (replied Sir Launcelot) &s;ince
I have not intere&s;t with you, I will
endeavour to provide for Mr. Jenkins
in &s;ome other way.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105">
That &s;ame afternoon he walked
over to the curate's hou&s;e, and told
him that he had &s;poken in his behalf
to Dr. Tootle, but the curacy was pre|engaged.
The good man having
made a thou&s;and acknowledgments
for the trouble his honour had taken;
&startq;I have not intere&s;t &s;ufficient to make
you curate, (&s;aid the knight) but I
can give you the living it&s;elf, and that
you &s;hall have.&endq; So &s;aying, he re|tired;
leaving Mr. Jenkins incapable
of uttering one &s;yllable, &s;o powerful|ly
was he &s;truck with this unexpected
turn of fortune. The pre&s;entation
was immediately made out; and in a
few days Mr. Jenkins was put in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his benefice, to the inex|pre&s;&s;ible
joy of the congregation. Hi|therto
every thing went right, and
every unprejudiced per&s;on commended
the knight's conduct: but, in a little
time, his genero&s;ity &s;eemed to over|leap
the bounds of di&s;cretion; and
even in &s;ome ca&s;es might be thought
tending to a breach of the king's
peace. For example, he compelled,
<PB N="101" REF="106">
<HI>vi &amp; armis,</HI> a rich farmer's &s;on to
marry the daughter of a cottager,
whom the young fellow had de|bauched.
Indeed it &s;eems there was
a promi&s;e of marriage in the ca&s;e,
though it could not be legally a&s;cer|tained.
The wench took on di&s;mal|ly;
and her parents had recour&s;e to
Sir Launcelot, who, &s;ending for the
delinquent, expo&s;tulated with him &s;e|verely
on the injury he had done the
young woman, and exhorted him to
&s;ave her life and reputation by per|forming
his promi&s;e; in which ca&s;e
he (Sir Launcelot) would give her
three hundred pounds to her portion.
Whether the farmer thought there
was &s;omething intere&s;ted in this un|common
offer, or was a little elevated
by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his father's
wealth; he rejected the propo&s;al with
ru&s;tic di&s;dain, and &s;aid, if &s;o be as
how the wench would &s;wear the child
to him, he would &s;ettle it with the
pari&s;h: but declared, that no &s;quire
in the land &s;hould oblige him to
buckle with &s;uch a cracked pitcher.
<PB N="102" REF="107">
This re&s;olution, however, he could
not maintain: for, in le&s;s than two
hours, the rector of the pari&s;h had
direction to publi&s;h the banns, and
the ceremony was performed in due
cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, though we know not preci&s;e|ly
the nature of the arguments that
were u&s;ed with the farmer, we may
conclude they were of the minatory
&s;pecies; for the young fellow could
not, for &s;ome time, look any per&s;on in
the face. The knight acted as the
general redre&s;&s;er of grievances. If a
woman complained to him of being
ill treated by her hu&s;band, he fir&s;t in|quired
into the foundation of the
complain; and if he found it ju&s;t,
catechi&s;ed the defendant. If the
warning had no effect, and the man
proceeded to fre&s;h acts of violence;
then his judge took the execution of
the law in his own hand, and hor&s;e|whipped
the party. Thus he invol|ved
him&s;elf in &s;everal law-&s;uits, that
drained him of pretty large &s;ums of
money. He &s;eemed particularly in|cen&s;ed
<PB N="103" REF="108">
at the lea&s;t appearance of op|pre&s;&s;ion;
and &s;upported divers poor
tenants again&s;t the extortion of the
landlords. Nay, he has been known
to travel two hundred miles as a vo|lunteer;
to offer his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the
cau&s;e of a per&s;on, who he heard was
by chicanery and oppre&s;&s;ion wronged
of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate. He accord|ingly
took her under his protection,
relieved her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and was at a
va&s;t expence in bringing the &s;uit to a
determination; which being un&s;a|vourable
to his client, he re&s;olved to
bring an appeal into the hou&s;e of
lords, and certainly would have exe|cuted
his purpo&s;e, if the gentlewoman
had not died in the interim.&endq;</P>
<P>At this period Ferret interrupted
the narrator, by ob&s;erving that the
&s;aid Greaves was a common nu&s;ance,
and ought to be pro&s;ecuted on the &s;ta|tute
of barretry. &startq;No, &s;ir, (re&s;umed
Mr. Clarke) he cannot be convicted
of barretry, unle&s;s he is always at va|riance
with &s;ome per&s;on or other, a
mover of &s;uits and quarrels, who di&s;|turbs
<PB N="104" REF="109">
the peace under colour of law.
Therefore he is in the indictment
&s;tiled, <HI>Communis malefactor, calumnia|tor
&amp; &s;eminator litium.</HI> &startq;Prithee,
truce with thy definitions, (cried Fer|ret)
and make an end of thy long|winded
&s;tory. Thou ha&s;t no title to
be &s;o tedious, until thou come&s;t to
have a coif in the court of common
pleas.&endq; Tom &s;miled contemptuous,
and had ju&s;t opened his mouth to
proceed, when the company were
di&s;turbed by a hideous repetition of
groans, that &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the
chamber in which the body of the
&s;quire was depo&s;ited. The landlady
&s;natched the candle, and ran into the
room, followed by the doctor and the
re&s;t; and this accident naaturally &s;u&s;|pended
the narration. In like man|ner
we &s;hall conclude the chapter, that
the reader may have time to breathe,
and dige&s;t what he has already heard.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="105" REF="110">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which this recapitulation draws to a clo&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the landlady entered the
room from whence the groan|ing
proceeded, &s;he found the &s;quire
lying on his back under the dominion
of the night-mare, which rode him
&s;o hard, that he not only groaned and
&s;norted, but the &s;weat ran down his
face in &s;treams. The perturbation of
his brain, occa&s;ioned by this pre&s;&s;ure,
and the fright he had lately under|gone,
gave ri&s;e to a very terrible
dream, in which he fancied him&s;elf
apprehended for a robbery. The hor|ror
of the gallows was &s;trong upon
him, when he was &s;uddenly awaked
by a violent &s;hock from the doctor;
and the company broke in upon his
view, &s;till perverted by fear, and be|dimmed
by &s;lumber. His dream was
now realized by a full per&s;ua&s;ion that
he was &s;urrounded by the con&s;table
and his gang. The fir&s;t object that
<PB N="106" REF="111">
pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his di&s;ordered view
was the figure of Ferret, who might
very well have pa&s;&s;ed for the fini&s;her
of the law: again&s;t him therefore the
fir&s;t effort of his de&s;pair was directed.
He &s;tarted upon the floor; and &s;eizing
a certain uten&s;il, that &s;hall be name|le&s;s,
launched it at the mi&s;anthrope
with &s;uch violence, that, had he not
cautiou&s;ly &s;lipped his head a&s;ide, it is
&s;uppo&s;ed that actual fire would have
been produced from the colli&s;ion of
two &s;uch hard and &s;olid &s;ub&s;tances.
All future mi&s;chief was prevented by
the &s;trength and agility of captain
Crowe, who, &s;pringing upon the a&s;|&s;ailant,
pinioned his arms to his &s;ides,
crying, &startq;O damn ye, if you are for
running a-head, I'll &s;oon bring you
to your bearings.&endq; The &s;quire thus
re&s;trained, &s;oon recollected him&s;elf,
and gazing upon every individual in
the apartment, &startq;Wounds! (&s;aid he)
I've had an ugly dream. I thought,
for all the world, they were carrying
me to Newgate; and that there was
Jack Ketch coom to vetch me before
<PB N="107" REF="112">
my taim.&endq; Ferret, who was the per&s;on
he had thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, eying him
with a look of the mo&s;t emphatic ma|levolence,
told him, it was very na|tural
for a knave to dream of New|gate;
and that he hoped to &s;ee the
day when this dream would be found
a true prophecy, and the common|wealth
purged of all &s;uch rogues and
vagabonds: but it could not be ex|pected
that the vulgar would be ho|ne&s;t
and con&s;cientious, while the great
were di&s;tingui&s;hed by profligacy and
corruption. The &s;quire was di&s;po&s;ed
to make a practical reply to this in&s;i|nuation,
when Mr. Ferret prudently
withdrew him&s;elf from the &s;cene of
altercation. The good woman of the
hou&s;e per&s;uaded his antagoni&s;t to take
out his nap, a&s;&s;uring him that the eggs
and bacon, with a mug of excellent
ale, &s;hould be forthcoming in due &s;ea|&s;on.
The affair being thus fortunate|ly
adju&s;ted, the gue&s;ts returned to the
kitchen, and Mr. Clarke re&s;umed his
&s;tory to this effect. &startq;You'll plea&s;e to
take notice, gemmen, that be&s;ides the
<PB N="108" REF="113">
in&s;tances I have alledged of Sir Laun|celot's
extravagant benevolence, I could
recount a great many others of the
&s;ame nature, and particularly the lau|dable
vengeance he took of a country
lawyer.&mdash;&mdash;I'm &s;orry that any &s;uch
mi&s;creant &s;hould belong to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion.
He was clerk of the a&s;&s;ize,
gemmen, in a certain town, not a
great way di&s;tant, and having a blank
pardon left by the judges for &s;ome
criminals, who&s;e ca&s;es were attended
with favourable circum&s;tances, he
would not in&s;ert the name of one who
could not procure a guinea for the
fee; and the poor fellow, who had
only &s;tole an hour-gla&s;s out of a &s;hoe|maker's
window, was actually exe|cuted
after a long re&s;pite; during
which he had been permitted to go
abroad, and earn his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by his
daily labour.</P>
<P>&startq;Sir Launcelot, being informed of
this barbarous act of avarice, and
having &s;ome ground that bordered on
the lawyer's e&s;tate, not only rendered
him contemptible and infamous, by
<PB N="109" REF="114">
expo&s;ing him as often as they met on
the grand jury, but al&s;o, being ve&s;ted
with the property of the great tythes,
proved &s;uch a trouble&s;ome neighbour,
&s;ometimes by making wa&s;te among
his hay and corn, &s;ometimes by in&s;ti|tuting
&s;uits again&s;t him for petty tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es,
that he was fairly obliged to
quit his habitation, and remove into
another part of the kingdom. All
the&s;e avocations could not divert Sir
Launcelot from the execution of a
wild &s;cheme, which has carried his
extravagance to &s;uch a pitch, that I
am afraid if a &s;tatute&mdash;&mdash;you under|&s;tand
me, gemmen, were &s;ued, the
jury would&mdash;&mdash;I don't choo&s;e to ex|plain
my&s;elf further on this circum|&s;tance.
Be that as it may, the &s;er|vants
at Greave&s;bury-hall were not a
little confounded, when their ma&s;ter
took down from the family armoury
a compleat &s;uit of armour, which had
belonged to his great grandfather, Sir
Marmaduke Greaves, a great war|rior,
who lo&s;t his life in the &s;ervice of
his king. This armour being &s;coured,
<PB N="110" REF="115">
repaired, and altered, &s;o as to fit Sir
Launcelot, a certain knight, whom I
don't choo&s;e to name, becau&s;e I be|lieve
he cannot be proved <HI>compos men|tis,</HI>
came down &s;eemingly on a vi&s;it,
with two attendants; and, on the eve
of the fe&s;tival of St. George, the ar|mour
being carried into the chapel,
Sir Launcelot (Lord have mercy upon
us!) remained all night in that di&s;mal
place, alone and without light, though
it was confidently reported all over the
country, that the place was haunted
by the &s;pirit of his great great uncle,
who, being lunatic, had cut his throat
from ear to ear, and was found dead
on the communion table.&endq;</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved, that while Mr.
Clarke rehear&s;ed this circum&s;tance,
his eyes began to &s;tare, and his teeth
to chatter; while Dolly, who&s;e looks
were fixed invariably on this narrator,
growing pale, and hitching her joint|&s;tool
nearer the chimney, exclaimed
in a frightened tone, &startq;Moother,
moother, in the neame of God, look
to 'un! how a quakes! as I'm a
<PB N="111" REF="116">
precious &s;aoul, a looks as if a &s;aw
&s;omething.&endq; Tom forced a &s;mile, and
thus proceeded:</P>
<P>&startq;While Sir Launcelot tarried with|in
the chapel, with the doors all
locked, the other knight &s;talked round
and round it on the out&s;ide, with his
&s;word drawn, to the terror of divers
per&s;ons who were pre&s;ent at the cere|mony.
As &s;oon as day broke he
opened one of the doors, and, going
in to Sir Launcelot, read a book for
&s;ome time, which we did &s;uppo&s;e to
be the con&s;titutions of knight-erran|try:
then we heard a loud &s;lap which
ecchoed through the whole chapel,
and the &s;tranger pronounce with an
audible and &s;olemn voice, &startq;In the
name of God, St. Michael, and St.
George, I dub thee knight&mdash;be faith|ful,
bold, and fortunate.&endq; You can|not
imagine, gemmen, what an effect
this &s;trange ceremony had upon the
people who were a&s;&s;embled. They
gazed at one another in &s;ilent horror;
and, when Sir Launcelot came forth
completely armed, took to their heels
<PB N="112" REF="117">
in a body, and fled with the utmo&s;t
precipitation. I my&s;elf was over|turned
in the crowd; and this was
the ca&s;e with that very individual per|&s;on
who now &s;erves him as a &s;quire.
He was &s;o frightened that he could
not ri&s;e, but lay roaring in &s;uch a
manner, that the knight came up, and
gave him a thwack with his launce
acro&s;s the &s;houlders, which rou&s;ed him
with a vengeance. For my own part,
I freely own I was not altogether un|moved
at &s;eeing &s;uch a figure come
&s;talking out of a church in the grey of
the morning; for it recalled to my re|membrance
the idea of the gho&s;t in
Hamlet, which I had &s;een acted in
Drury-lane, when I made my fir&s;t
trip to London; and I had not yet got
rid of the impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;Sir Launcelot, attended by the
other knight, proceeded to the &s;table;
from whence, with his own hands,
he drew forth one of his be&s;t hor&s;es,
a fine mettle&s;ome &s;orrel, who had got
blood in him, ornamented with rich
trappings. In a trice the two knights,
<PB N="113" REF="118">
and the other two &s;trangers, who now
appeared to be trumpeters, were
mounted. Sir Launcelot's armour
was lacquered black; and on his
&s;hield was repre&s;ented the moon in
her fir&s;t quarter, with the motto <HI>im|pleat
orbem.</HI> The trumpets having
&s;ounded a charge, the &s;tranger pro|nounced
with a loud voice, &startq;God pre|&s;erve
this gallant knight in all his ho|nourable
atchievements; and may he
long continue to pre&s;s the &s;ides of his
now adopted &s;teed, which I denominate
Bronzomarte, hoping that he will ri|val
in &s;wiftne&s;s and &s;pirit Bayardo,
Brigliadoro, or any other &s;teed of pa&s;t
or pre&s;ent chivalry? After another
flouri&s;h of the trumpets, all four clap|ped
&s;purs to their hor&s;es, Sir Launce|lot
couching his launce, and galloped
to and fro, as if they had been mad,
to the terror and a&s;toni&s;hment of all
the &s;pectators. What &s;hould have
induced our knight to choo&s;e this here
man for his &s;quire, is not ea&s;y to de|termine;
for, of all the &s;ervants about
the hou&s;e, he was the lea&s;t likely ei|ther
<PB N="114" REF="119">
to plea&s;e his ma&s;ter, or engage in
&s;uch an undertaking. His name is
Timothy Crab&s;haw, and he acted in
the capacity of whipper-in to Sir Ever|hard.
He afterwards married the
daughter of a poor cottager, by whom
he has &s;everal children, and was em|ployed
about the hou&s;e as a plough|man
and carter. To be &s;ure the fel|low
has a dry &s;ort of humour about
him: but he was univer&s;ally hated
among the &s;ervants for his abu&s;ive
tongue and perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, which
often brought him into trouble; for
though the fellow is as &s;trong as an
elephant, he has no more courage na|turally
than a chicken&mdash;I &s;ay natural|ly,
becau&s;e, &s;ince his being a member
of knight-errantry, he has done &s;ome
things that appear altogether incredi|ble
and praeternatural.</P>
<P>&startq;Timothy kept &s;uch a bawling,
after he had received the blow from
Sir Launcelot, that every body on the
field thought &s;ome of his bones were
broken; and his wife, with five bant|lings,
came &s;nivelling to the knight,
<PB N="115" REF="120">
who ordered her to &s;end the hu&s;|band
directly to his hou&s;e. Tim ac|cordingly
went thither, groaning pi|teou&s;ly
all the way, creeping along
with his body bent like a Greenland
canoe. As &s;oon as he entered the
court, the outward door was &s;hut;
and Sir Launcelot coming down &s;tairs
with a hor&s;ewhip in his hand, a&s;ked
what was the matter with him that he
complained &s;o di&s;mally? To this que|&s;tion
he replied, that it was as com|mon
as duck-weed in his country, for
a man to complain when his bones
were broke.&endq; &startq;What &s;hould have
broke your bones?&endq; &s;aid the knight.
&startq;I cannot gue&s;s, (an&s;wered the other)
unle&s;s it was that delicate &s;witch that
your honour in your mad pranks
handled &s;o dextrou&s;ly upon my car|ca&s;e.&endq;
Sir Launcelot then told him,
there was nothing &s;o good for a brui&s;e
as a &s;weat, and he had the remedy in
his hand. Timothy eying the hor&s;e|whip
a&s;kance, ob&s;erved that there
was another &s;till more &s;peedy; to wit,
a moderate pill of lead, with a &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="116" REF="121">
do&s;e of gun-powder. &startq;No,
ra&s;cal, (cried the knight) that mu&s;t
be re&s;erved for your betters.&endq; So &s;ay|ing,
he employed the in&s;trument &s;o
effectually, that Crab&s;haw &s;oon forgot
his fractured ribs, and capered about
with great agility. When he had
been di&s;ciplined in this manner to
&s;ome purpo&s;e, the knight told him he
might retire; but ordered him to re|turn
next morning, when he &s;hould
have a repetition of the medicine, pro|vided
he did not find him&s;elf capable
of walking in an erect po&s;ture. The
gate was no &s;ooner thrown open, than
Timothy ran home with all the &s;peed
of a grey-hound, and corrected his
wife, by who&s;e advice he had pre|tended
to be &s;o grievou&s;ly damaged in
his per&s;on. No body dreamed that
he would next day pre&s;ent him&s;elf at
Greave&s;bury-hall; neverthele&s;s, he was
there very early in the morning, and
even clo&s;etted a whole hour with Sir
Launcelot. He came out making wry
faces, and &s;everal times &s;lapped him|&s;elf
on the fore-head, crying, &startq;Bodi|kins!
<PB N="117" REF="122">
thof he be creazy, I an't, that
I an't!&endq; When he was a&s;ked what
was the matter, he &s;aid, he believed
the devil had got in him, and he
&s;hould never be his own man again.
That &s;ame day the knight carried him
to A&s;henton, where he be&s;poke tho&s;e
accoutrements which he now wears;
and while the&s;e were making, it was
thought the poor fellow would have
run di&s;tracted. He did nothing but
growl, and cur&s;e, and &s;wear to him|&s;elf,
run backwards and forwards be|tween
his own hutt and Greave&s;bury|hall,
and quarrel with the hor&s;es in
the &s;table. At length his wife and fa|mily
were removed into a &s;nug farm|hou&s;e
that happened to be empty, and
care taken that they &s;hould be com|fortably
maintained.</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e precautions being taken,
the knight, one morning, at day|break,
mounted Bronzomarte, and
Crab&s;haw as his &s;quire, a&s;cended the
back of a clum&s;y cart-hor&s;e, called
Gilbert. This again was looked up|on
as an in&s;tance of in&s;anity in the
<PB N="118" REF="123">
&s;aid Crab&s;haw; for, of all the hor&s;es
in the &s;table, Gilbert was the mo&s;t
&s;tubborn and vicious, and had often
like to have done a mi&s;chief to Timo|thy
while he drove the cart and
plough. When he was out of hu|mour
he would kick and plunge as if
the devil was in him. He once thru&s;t
Crab&s;haw into the middle of a quick|&s;et-hedge,
where he was terribly torn;
another time he canted him over his
head into a quagmire, where he &s;tuck
with his heels up, and mu&s;t have pe|ri&s;hed
if people had not been pa&s;&s;ing
that way; a third time he &s;eized him
in the &s;table with his teeth by the rim
of the belly, and &s;wung him off the
ground, to the great danger of his life;
and I'll be hanged if it was not owing
to Gilbert that Crab&s;haw was now
thrown into the river. Thus mounted
and accoutred, the knight and his
&s;quire &s;et out on their fir&s;t excur&s;ion.
They turned off from the common
highway, and travelled all that day
without meeting any thing worth re|counting:
but, in the morning of the
<PB N="119" REF="124">
&s;econd day, they were favoured with
an adventure. The hunt was upon
a common, through which they tra|velled,
and the hounds were in full
cry after a fox, when Crab&s;haw,
prompted by his own mi&s;chievous di&s;|po&s;ition,
and neglecting the order of
his ma&s;ter, who called aloud to him
to de&s;i&s;t, rode up to the hounds, and
cro&s;&s;ed them at full gallop. The
hunt&s;man, who was not far off, run|ning
towards the &s;quire, be&s;towed up|on
his head &s;uch a memento with his
pole, as made the land&s;chape dance
before his eyes; and in a twinkling
he was &s;urrounded by all the fox|hunters,
who plied their whips about
his ears with infinite agility. Sir
Launcelot advancing at an ea&s;y pace,
in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the di&s;a&s;trous &s;quire,
exhorted his adver&s;aries to puni&s;h him
&s;everely for his in&s;olence, and they
were not &s;low in obeying this injunc|tion.
Crab&s;haw finding him&s;elf in
this di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, and that
there was no &s;uccour to be expected
from his ma&s;ter, on who&s;e prowe&s;s he
<PB N="120" REF="125">
had depended, grew de&s;perate; and,
clubbing his whip, laid about him
with great fury, wheeling about Gil|bert,
who was not idle; for he, hav|ing
received &s;ome of the favours in|tended
for his rider, both bit with
his teeth, and kicked with his heels;
and at la&s;t made his way through the
ring that incircled him, though not
before he had broke the hunt&s;man's
leg, lamed one of the be&s;t hor&s;es on
the field, and killed half a &s;core of
the hounds. Crab&s;haw &s;eeing him|&s;elf
clear of the fray, did not tarry to
take leave of his ma&s;ter, but made the
mo&s;t of his way to Greave&s;bury-hall,
where he appeared hardly with any
ve&s;tige of the human countenance, &s;o
much had he been defaced in this ad|venture.
He did not fail to rai&s;e a
great clamour again&s;t Sir Launcelot,
whom he cur&s;ed as a coward in plain
terms, &s;wearing he would never &s;erve
him another day: but whether he al|tered
his mind on cooler reflection, or
was lectured by his wife, who well
under&s;tood her own intere&s;t, he ro&s;e
<PB N="121" REF="126">
with the cock, and went again in
que&s;t of Sir Launcelot, whom he
found on the eve of a very hazardous
enterprize. In the mid&s;t of a lane
the knight happened to meet with a
party of about forty recruits, com|manded
by a &s;erjeant, a corporal,
and a drummer, which la&s;t had his
drum &s;lung at his back; but &s;eeing
&s;uch a &s;trange figure mounted on a
high-&s;pirited hor&s;e, he was &s;eiz|ed
with an inclination to divert his
company. With this view he braced
his drum, and, hanging it in its pro|per
po&s;ition, began to beat a point of
war, advancing under the very no&s;e of
Bronzomarte; while the corporal ex|claimed,
&startq;Damn my eyes, who have
we got here? old king Stephen, from
the hor&s;e armoury, in the Tower; or
the fellow that rides armed at my
lord mayor's &s;hew.&endq; The knight's
&s;teed &s;eemed at lea&s;t as well plea&s;ed
with the &s;ound of the drum as were
the recruits that followed it; and &s;ig|nified
his &s;atisfaction in &s;ome curvet|tings
and caprioles, which did not at
<PB N="122" REF="127">
all di&s;compo&s;e the rider, who, addre&s;s|ing
him&s;elf to the &s;erjeant, &startq;Friend,
&s;aid he, you ought to teach your drum|mer
better manners. I would cha&s;|ti&s;e
the fellow on the &s;pot for his in|&s;olence,
were it not out of the re|&s;pect
I bear to his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.&endq;
&startq;Re&s;pect mine a&mdash;! (cried this
ferocious commander) what, d'ye
think to frighten us with your pew|ter
pi&s;spot on your &s;cull, and your
lacquer'd potlid on your arm? get
out of the way and be damned, or
I'll rai&s;e with my halbert &s;uch a clut|ter
upon your target, that you'll re|member
it the longe&s;t day you have to
live.&endq; At that in&s;tant, Crab&s;haw arriv|ing
upon Gilbert, &startq;So ra&s;cal, &s;aid Sir
Launcelot, you are returned. Go and
beat in that &s;coundrel's drum-head.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;quire, who &s;aw no wea|pons
of offence about the drummer
but a &s;word, which he hoped the
owner dur&s;t not draw; and being re|&s;olved
to exert him&s;elf in making a|tonement
for his de&s;ertion, advanced
to execute his ma&s;ter's orders: but
<PB N="123" REF="128">
Gilbert, who liked not the noi&s;e,
refu&s;ed to proceed in the ordinary
way. Then the &s;quire turning his
tail to the drummer, he advanced
in a retrograde motion, and with
one kick of his heels, not only broke
the drum into a thou&s;and pieces,
but laid the drummer in the mire,
with &s;uch a blow upon his hip-bone,
that he halted all the days of his
life. The recruits, perceiving the
di&s;comfiture of their leader, armed
them&s;elves with &s;tones; the &s;erjeant
rai&s;ed his halbert in a po&s;ture of de|fence,
and immediately a &s;evere ac|tion
en&s;ued. By this time, Crab|&s;haw
had drawn his &s;word, and be|gun
to lay about him like a devil
incarnate; but, in a little time, he
was &s;aluted by a volley of &s;tones,
one of which knocked out two of
his grinders, and brought him to
the earth, where he had like to
have found no quarter; for the
whole company crowded about him,
with their cudgels brandi&s;hed; and
perhaps he owed his pre&s;ervation to
<PB N="124" REF="129">
their pre&s;&s;ing &s;o hard that they hin|dered
one another from u&s;ing their
weapons. Sir Launcelot, &s;eeing with
indignation the unworthy treatment
his &s;quire had received, and &s;corning
to &s;tain his launce with the blood of
plebeians, in&s;tead of couching it in
the re&s;t, &s;eized it by the middle, and
fetching one blow at the &s;erjeant,
broke in twain the halbert which
he had rai&s;ed as a quarter-&s;taff for his
defence. The &s;econd &s;troke encoun|tered
his pate, which being the hard|e&s;t
part about him, &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock
without damage; but the third, light|ing
on his ribs, he honoured the giver
with immediate pro&s;tration. The
general being thus overthrown, Sir
Launcelot advanced to the relief of
Crab&s;haw, and handled his weapon
&s;o effectually, that the whole body
of the enemy were di&s;abled or rout|ed,
before one cudgel had touched
the carca&s;s of the fallen &s;quire. As
for the corporal, in&s;tead of &s;tand|ing
by his commanding officer, he
had overleaped the hedge, and run
<PB N="125" REF="130">
to the con&s;table of an adjoining vil|lage
for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Accordingly, be|fore
Crab&s;haw could be properly
remounted, the peace officer arriv|ed
with his po&s;&s;e; and by the cor|poral
was charged with Sir Launce|lot
and his &s;quire, as two highway|men.
The con&s;table, a&s;toni&s;hed at
the martial figure of the knight, and
intimidated at &s;ight of the havock he
had made, contented him&s;elf with
&s;tanding at a di&s;tance, di&s;playing the
badge of his office, and reminding
the knight that he repre&s;ented his
maje&s;ty's per&s;on. Sir Launcelot, &s;ee|ing
the poor man in great agitation,
a&s;&s;ured him that his de&s;ign was to en|force,
not violate the laws of his
country; and that he and his &s;quire
would attend him to the next ju&s;tice
of the peace; but, in the mean time,
he, in his turn, charged the peace|officer
with the &s;erjeant and the drum|mer,
who had begun the fray. The
ju&s;tice had been a pettifogger, and
was a &s;ycophant to a nobleman in the
neighbourhood, who had a po&s;t at
<PB N="126" REF="131">
court. He therefore thought he
&s;hould oblige his patron, by &s;hew|ing
his re&s;pect for <HI>the military;</HI> and
treated our knight with the mo&s;t
boori&s;h in&s;olence; but refu&s;ed to
admit him into his hou&s;e, until he
had &s;urrendered all his weapons of
offence to the con&s;table. Sir Launce|lot
and his &s;quire being found the
aggre&s;&s;ors, the ju&s;tice in&s;i&s;ted upon
making out their mittimus, if they
did not find bail immediately; and
could hardly be prevailed upon to
agree that they &s;hould remain at
the hou&s;e of the con&s;table, who,
being a publican, undertook to keep
them in &s;afe cu&s;tody, until the knight
could write to his &s;teward. Mean
while he was bound over to the peace;
and the &s;erjeant with his drummer
were told they had a good action a|gain&s;t
him for a&s;&s;ault and battery, ei|ther
by information or indictment.
They were not, however, &s;o &s;ond of
the law as the ju&s;tice &s;eemed to be.
Their &s;entiments had taken a turn in
favour of Sir Launcelot, during the
<PB N="127" REF="132">
cour&s;e of his examination, by which
it appeared that he was really a gen|tleman
of fa&s;hion and fortune; and
they re&s;olved to compromi&s;e the af|fair
without the intervention of his
wor&s;hip. Accordingly, the &s;erjeant
repaired to the con&s;table's hou&s;e,
where the knight was lodged; and
humbled him&s;elf before his honour,
prote&s;ting with many oaths, that if
he had known his quality he would
have beaten the drummer's brains a|bout
his ears, for pre&s;uming to give
his honour or his hor&s;e the lea&s;t di|&s;turbance;
thof the fellow, he be|lieved,
was &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed in
being a cripple for life. Sir Launce|lot
admitted of his apologies; and
taking compa&s;&s;ion on the fellow who
had &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely for his folly,
re&s;olved to provide for his mainte|nance.
Upon the repre&s;entation of
the parties to the ju&s;tice, the war|rant
was next day di&s;charged; and
the knight returned to his own hou&s;e,
attended by the &s;erjeant and the drum|mer
mounted on hor&s;eback, the
<PB N="128" REF="133">
recruits being left to the corporal's
charge.</P>
<P>&startq;The halberdeer found the good
effects of Sir Launcelot's liberality;
and his companion being rendered
unfit for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice by the
heels of Gilbert, is now entertained
at Greave&s;bury-hall, where he will
probably remain for life. As for
Crab&s;haw, his ma&s;ter gave him to
under&s;tand, that if he did not think
him pretty well cha&s;ti&s;ed for his
pre&s;umption and flight by the di&s;|cipline
he had undergone in the la&s;t
two adventures, he would turn him
out of his &s;ervice with di&s;grace. Ti|mothy
&s;aid he believed it would be
the greate&s;t favour he could do him
to turn him out of a &s;ervice in which
he knew he &s;hould be rib-roa&s;ted
every day, and murdered at la&s;t. In
this &s;ituation were things at Greave&s;|bury-hall
about a month ago, when
I cro&s;&s;ed the country to Ferry-bridge,
where I met my uncle: probably,
this is the fir&s;t incident of their &s;econd
excur&s;ion; for the di&s;tance between
<PB N="129" REF="134">
this here hou&s;e and Sir Launcelot's
e&s;tate, does not exceed four&s;core or
ninety miles.&endq;</P>

<P>MR. Clarke having made an end
of his narrative, the &s;urgeon
thanked him for the entertainment he
had received; and Mr. Ferret &s;hrug|ged
up his &s;houlders in &s;ilent di&s;ap|probation.
As for captain Crowe,
who u&s;ed at &s;uch pau&s;es to pour in a
broad&s;ide of di&s;membered remarks,
linked together like chain-&s;hot, he
&s;poke not a &s;yllable for &s;ome time;

began to roll &s;uch voluminous

Though he thus &s;hrouded
him&s;elf from their view, he did not

knew to be a &s;ea-laugh, and this was
followed by an eager exclamation of
&startq;Rare pa&s;time, &s;trike my yards and

the figure that now &s;aluted

and terrible than the fire-breathing
chimaera of the antients. Notwith|&s;tanding

The &s;urgeon was one of tho&s;e
wags who can laugh inwardly, with|out
exhibiting the lea&s;t outward mark
of mirth or &s;atisfaction. He at once
perceived the amu&s;ement which might
be drawn from this &s;trange di&s;po&s;ition
of the &s;ailor, together with the mo&s;t
likely means which could be u&s;ed to
divert him from &s;uch an extravagant

the wink with one &s;ide of his face,
while the other was very gravely turn|ed

performed by any per&s;on what&s;o|ever.
Don Quixote was dubbed by
his landlord; and there are many
in&s;tances on record, of errants oblig|ing
and compelling the next per&s;on
they met to cro&s;s their &s;houlders, and
dub them knights. I my&s;elf would
undertake to be your godfather; and
<PB N="134" REF="139">
I have intere&s;t enough to procure the
keys of the pari&s;h church that &s;tands
hard by; be&s;ides, this is the eve of
St. Martin, who was him&s;elf a knight|errant,
and therefore a proper patron
to a noviciate. I wi&s;h we could bor|row
Sir Launcelot's armour for the
occa&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>Crowe, being &s;truck with this hint,
&s;tarted up, and laying his fingres on his
lips to enjoin &s;ilence, walked off &s;oftly
on his tiptoes, to li&s;ten at the door of
our knight's apartment, and judge
whether or not he was a&s;leep. Mr.
Fillet took this opportunity to tell his
nephew, that it would be in vain for
him to combat this humour with rea|&s;on
and argument: but the mo&s;t ef|fectual
way of diverting him from the
plan of knight-errantry would be, to
frighten him heartily while he &s;hould
keep his vigil in the church. To|wards
the accompli&s;hment of which
purpo&s;e he craved the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
mi&s;anthrope as well as the nephew.
Clarke &s;eemed to reli&s;h the &s;cheme;
and ob&s;erved that his uncle, though
<PB N="135" REF="140">
endued with courage enough to face
any human danger, had at bottom a
&s;trong fund of &s;uper&s;tition, which he
had acquired, or at lea&s;t improved, in
the cour&s;e of a &s;ea-life. Ferret, who
perhaps would not have gone ten paces
out of his road to &s;ave Crowe from the
gallows, neverthele&s;s, engaged as an
auxiliary, merely in hope of &s;eeing a
fellow-creature mi&s;erable; and even
undertook to be the principal agent in
this adventure. For this office, in|deed,
he was better qualified than they
could have imagined: in the bundle
which he kept under his great coat,
there was, together with divers no&s;|trums,
a &s;mall vial of liquid pho&s;pho|rus,
&s;ufficient, as he had already ob|&s;erved,
to frighten a whole neigh|bourhood
out of their &s;en&s;es. In order
to concert the previous mea&s;ures, with|out
being overheard, the&s;e confede|rates
retired with a candle and lan|thorn
into the &s;table; and their backs
were &s;carce turned, when captain
Crowe came in loaded with pieces of
the knight's armour, which he had
<PB N="136" REF="141">
conveyed from the apartment of Sir
Launcelot, whom he had left fa&s;t
a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Under&s;tanding that the re&s;t of the
company were gone out for a moment,
he could not re&s;i&s;t the inclination he
felt of communicating his intention to
the landlady, who, with her daugh|ter,
had been too much engaged in
preparing Crab&s;haw's &s;upper, to know
the purport of their conver&s;ation. The
good woman, being informed of the
captain's de&s;ign to remain alone all
night in the church, began to oppo&s;e
it with all her rhetorick. She &s;aid it
was &s;etting his Maker at defiance, and
a wilful running into temptation. She
a&s;&s;ured him all the country knew that
the church was haunted by &s;pirits and
hobgoblins: that lights had been &s;een
in every corner of it; and a tall wo|man
in white had one night appeared
upon the top of the tower: that dread|ful
&s;hrieks were often heard to come
from the &s;outh aile, where a mur|dered
man had been buried: that &s;he
her&s;elf had &s;een the cro&s;s on the &s;tee|ple
<PB N="137" REF="142">
all a-fire; and one evening as &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed a hor&s;e-back clo&s;e by the &s;tile
at the entrance into the church-yard,
the hor&s;e &s;tood &s;till, &s;weating and
trembling, and had no power to pro|ceed
until &s;he had repeated the Lord's
Prayer.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks made a &s;trong im|pre&s;&s;ion
on the imagination of Crowe,
who a&s;ked, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, if &s;he
had got that &s;ame prayer in print. She
made no an&s;wer; but reaching the
prayer-book from a &s;helf, and turning
up the leaf, put it into his hand: then
the captain, having adju&s;ted his &s;pec|tacles,
began to read or rather &s;pell
aloud with equal eagerne&s;s and &s;olem|nity.
He had refre&s;hed his memory
&s;o well as to remember the whole;
when the doctor, returning with his
companions, gave him to under&s;tand
that he had procured the key of the
chancel, where he might watch his
armour as well as in the body of the
church; and that he was ready to
conduct him to the &s;pot. Crowe was
not now quite &s;o forward as he had
<PB N="138" REF="143">
appeared before to atchieve this ad|venture.
He began to &s;tart objections
with re&s;pect to the borrowed armour:
he wanted to &s;tipulate the comforts of
a can of flip, and a candle's end, dur|ing
his vigil; and hinted &s;omething
of the damage he might &s;u&s;tain from
your malicious imps of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>The doctor told him, the con&s;titu|tions
of chivalry ab&s;olutely required
that he &s;hould be left in the dark
alone, and fa&s;ting, to &s;pend the night
in pious meditations; but if he had
any fears which di&s;turbed his con|&s;cience,
he had much better de&s;i&s;t,
and give up all thoughts of knight-er|rantry,
which could not con&s;i&s;t with
the lea&s;t &s;hadow of apprehen&s;ion. The
captain, &s;tung by this remark, re|plied
not a word; but gathering up
the armour into a bundle, threw it on
his back, and &s;et out for the place of
probation, preceded by Clarke with
the lanthorn. When they arrived at
the church, Fillet, who had procured
the key from the &s;exton, who was his
patient, opened the door, and con|ducted
<PB N="139" REF="144">
our novice into the middle of
the chancel, where the armour was
depo&s;ited. Then bidding Crowe draw
his hanger, committed him to the
protection of heaven, a&s;&s;uring him he
would come back, and find him ei|ther
dead or alive by day-break, and
perform the remaining part of the ce|remony.
So &s;aying, he and the other
a&s;&s;ociates &s;hook him by the hand and
took their leave, after the &s;urgeon had
tilted up the lanthorn, in order to take
a view of his vi&s;age, which was pale
and haggard.</P>
<P>Before the door was locked upon
him, he called aloud, &startq;Hilloa! doc|tor,
hip&mdash;another word, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;&endq;
They forthwith returned, to know
what he wanted, and found him al|ready
in a &s;weat. &startq;Heark ye, bro|ther
(&s;aid he, wiping his face) I do
&s;uppo&s;e as how one may pa&s;s away the
time in whi&s;tling the black joke, or
&s;inging black-ey'd Su&s;an, or &s;ome &s;uch
&s;orrowful ditty.&endq; &startq;By no means,
(cried the doctor) &s;uch pa&s;times are
neither &s;uitable to the place, nor the
<PB N="140" REF="145">
occa&s;ion, which is altogether a reli|gious
exerci&s;e. If you have got any
p&s;alms by heart, you may &s;ing a &s;tave
or two, or repeat the doxology.&endq;
&startq;Would I had Tom Laverick here,
(replied our novitiate) he would &s;ing
you anthems like a &s;ea-mew&mdash;a had
been a clerk a-&s;hore&mdash;many's the time
and often I've given him a rope's end
for &s;inging p&s;alms in the larboard
watch&mdash;would I had hired the &s;on of
a bitch to have taught me a ca&s;t of
his office&mdash;but it cannot be holp, bro|ther&mdash;if
we can't go large, we mu&s;t
haul upon a wind, as the &s;aying is&mdash;
if we can't &s;ing, we mu&s;t pray.&endq;
The company again left him to his
devotion, and returned to the public
hou&s;e, in order to execute the e&s;&s;ential
part of their project.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which the knight re&s;umes his im|portance.</HEAD>
<P>DOCTOR Fillet having borrowed
a couple of &s;heets from the land|lady,
dre&s;&s;ed the mi&s;anthrope and Tom
Clarke in gho&s;tly apparel, which was
re-inforced by a few drops of liquid
pho&s;phorus, from Ferret's phial, rub|bed
on the fore-heads of the two ad|venturers.
Thus equipped they re|turned
to the church with their con|ductor,
who entered with them &s;oftly
at an aile which was oppo&s;ite to a
place where the novice kept watch.
They &s;tole unperceived through the
body of the church; and though it
was &s;o dark that they could not di&s;|tingui&s;h
the captain with the eye, they
heard the &s;ound of his &s;teps, as he
walked backwards and forwards on
the pavement with uncommon expe|dition,
and an ejaculation now and
then e&s;cape in a murmur from his
lips.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="147">
The triumvirate having taken their
&s;tation, with a large pew in their front,
the two gho&s;ts uncovered their heads,
which, by help of the pho&s;phorus, ex|hibited
a pale and lambent flame, ex|tremely
di&s;mal and gha&s;tly to the
view; then Ferret, in a &s;queaking tone
exclaimed, &startq;Samuel Crowe! Samuel
Crowe!&endq; The captain hearing him|&s;elf
acco&s;ted in this manner, at &s;uch a
time, and in &s;uch a place, replied,
&startq;Hilloah;&endq; and turning his eyes to|wards
the quarter whence the voice
&s;eemed to proceed, beheld the terrible
apparition. This no &s;ooner &s;aluted
his view, than his hair bri&s;tled up, his
knees began to knock, and his teeth to
chatter, while he cried aloud, &startq;In the
name of God, where are you bound,
ho?&endq; To this hail, the mi&s;anthrope
an&s;wered, &startq;We are the &s;pirits of
thy grandmother Jane and thy aunt
Bridget.&endq;</P>
<P>At mention of the&s;e names, Crowe's
terrors began to give way to his re&s;ent|ment,
and he pronounced in a quick
tone of &s;urprize, mixed with indigna|tion,
<PB N="143" REF="148">
&startq;What d'ye want? what d'ye
want? what d'ye want, ho?&endq; The
&s;pirit replied, &startq;We are &s;ent to warn
thee of thy fate.&endq; &startq;From whence,
ho?&endq; cried the captain, who&s;e choler
had by this time well nigh triumphed
over his fear. &startq;From heaven,&endq; &s;aid
the voice. &startq;Ye lie, ye b&mdash;s of hell!
(did our novice exclaim) ye are dam|ned
for heaving me out of my right,
five fathom and a half by the lead, in
burning brim&s;tone. Don't I &s;ee the
blue flames come out of your haw&s;e|holes&mdash;mayhap
you may be the devil
him&s;elf for aught I know&mdash;&mdash;but, I
tru&s;t in the Lord, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;I never
di&s;rated a kin&s;man, d'ye &s;ee; &s;o don't
come along &s;ide of me&mdash;put about on
th'other tack, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;you need not
clap hard aweather, for you'll &s;oon
get to hell again with a flowing &s;ail.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he had recour&s;e to his
Pater-no&s;ter; but perceiving the ap|paritions
approach, he thundered out,
&startq;Ava&s;t,&mdash;ava&s;t&mdash;&s;heer off, ye babes
of hell, or I'll be foul of your fore|lights.&endq;
He accordingly &s;prung for|wards
<PB N="144" REF="149">
with his hanger, and very pro|bably
would have &s;et the &s;pirits on
their way to the other world, had not
he fallen over a pew in the dark, and
intangled him&s;elf &s;o much among the
benches, that he could not imme|diately
recover his footing. The
triumvirate took this opportunity to
retire; and &s;uch was the precipitation
of Ferret in his retreat, that he en|countered
a po&s;t, by which his right
eye &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage: a
circum&s;tance which induced him to
inveigh bitterly again&s;t his own folly,
as well as the impertinence of his
companions, who had inveigled him
into &s;uch a trouble&s;ome adventure.
Neither he nor Clarke could be pre|vailed
upon to revi&s;it the novice. The
doctor him&s;elf thought his di&s;ea&s;e was
de&s;perate; and, mounting his hor&s;e,
returned to his own habitation.</P>
<P>Ferret, finding all the beds in the
public hou&s;e were occupied, compo&s;ed
him&s;elf to &s;leep in a wind&s;or-chair at
the chimney-corner; and Mr. Clarke,
who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was extremely amo|rous,
<PB N="145" REF="150">
re&s;olved to renew his practices on
the heart of Dolly. He had reconnoitred
the apartments in which the bodies of
the knight and his &s;quire were depo|&s;ited,
and di&s;covered clo&s;e by the top
of the &s;tair-ca&s;e a &s;ort of a clo&s;et or
hovel ju&s;t large enough to contain a
truckle-bed, which, from &s;ome other
particulars, he &s;uppo&s;ed to be the bed-chamber
of his beloved Dolly, who
had by this time retired to her repo&s;e.
Full of this idea, and in&s;tigated by
the daemon of de&s;ire, Mr. Thomas
crept &s;oftly up &s;tairs; and lifting the
latch of the clo&s;et-door, his heart be|gan
to palpitate with joyous expecta|tion:
but before he could breathe the
gentle effu&s;ions of his love, the &s;up|po&s;ed
dam&s;el &s;tarted up, and &s;eizing
him by the collar with an Herculean
gripe, uttered, in the voice of Crab|&s;haw,
&startq;It wa'n't for nothing that I
dreamed of Newgate, &s;irrah; but
I'd have thee to know, an arrant
&s;quire is not to be robbed by &s;uch a
peddling thief as thee&mdash;here I'll howld
thee va&s;t, and the devil were in thy
<PB N="146" REF="151">
doublet&mdash;help! murder! vire!
help!&endq;</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for Mr. Clarke to
di&s;engage him&s;elf, and equally im|practicable
to &s;peak in his own vindi|cation;
&s;o that here he &s;tood trem|bling
and half throttled, until the
whole hou&s;e being alarmed, the land|lady
and her o&s;tler ran up &s;tairs with
a candle. When the light rendered
objects vi&s;ible, an equal a&s;toni&s;hment
prevailed on all &s;ides: Crab&s;haw was
confounded at &s;ight of Mr. Clarke,
who&s;e per&s;on he well knew; and re|lea&s;ing
him in&s;tantly from his gra&s;p,
&startq;Bodikins! (cried he) I believe as
how this haw&s;e is haunted&mdash;who
thought to meet with Mea&s;ter Laayer
Clarke at midnight, and &s;o far from
hoam.&endq; The landlady could not
comprehend the meaning of this en|counter;
nor could Tom conceive
how Crab&s;haw had tran&s;ported him|&s;elf
hither from the room below, in
which he &s;aw him quietly repo&s;ed.
Yet nothing was more ea&s;y than to
explain this my&s;tery: the apartment
<PB N="147" REF="152">
below was the chamber which the
ho&s;te&s;s and her daughter re&s;erved for
their own convenience; and this
particular having been intimated to
the &s;quire while he was at &s;upper, he
had re&s;igned the bed quietly, and been
conducted hither in the ab&s;ence of
the company. Tom, recollecting
him&s;elf as well as he could, pro|fe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf of Crab&s;haw's opini|on,
that the hou&s;e was haunted,
declaring that he could not well ac|count
for his being there in the dark;
and leaving tho&s;e that were a&s;&s;em|bled
to di&s;cu&s;s this knotty point, re|tired
down &s;tairs, in hope of meeting
with his charmer, whom accordingly
he found in the kitchen ju&s;t ri&s;en,
and wrapped in a loo&s;e di&s;habille.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e of Crab&s;haw's cries had
awakened and arou&s;ed his ma&s;ter,
who, ri&s;ing &s;uddenly in the dark,
&s;natched up his &s;word that lay by
his bed-&s;ide, and ha&s;tened to the
&s;cene of tumult, where all their
mouths were opened at once, to ex|plain
the cau&s;e of the di&s;turbance,
<PB N="148" REF="153">
and make an apology for breaking
his honour's re&s;t. He &s;aid nothing;
but taking the candle in his hand,
beckoned to his &s;quire to follow him
into his apartment, re&s;olving to arm
and take hor&s;e immediately. Crab|&s;haw
under&s;tood his meaning; and
while he &s;huffled on his cloaths,
yawning hideou&s;ly all the while,
wi&s;hed the lawyer at the devil for
having vi&s;ited him &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably;
and even cur&s;ed him&s;elf for the noi&s;e
he had made, in con&s;equence of which
he fore&s;aw he &s;hould now be obliged
to forfeit his night's re&s;t, and travel
in the dark, expo&s;ed to the inclemen|cies
of the weather. &startq;Pox rot thee,
Tom Clarke, for a wicked laayer!
(&s;aid he to him&s;elf) had&s;t thou been
hanged at Bartlemey-tide, I &s;hould
this night have &s;$ept in peace, that I
&s;hould&mdash;an I would there was a
bli&s;ter on this plaguy tongue of mine
for making &s;uch a hollowballoo; that
I do&mdash;five gallons of cold water has
my poor belly been drenched with
&s;ince night fell; &s;o as my reins and
<PB N="149" REF="154">
my liver are all one as if they were
turned into ice, and my whole har|&s;let
&s;hakes and &s;hivers like a vial of
quick-&s;ilver. I have been dragged,
half drowned like a rotten ewe, from
the bottom of a river; and who
knows but I may be next dragged
quite dead from the bottom of a
coal-pit&mdash;if &s;o be as I am, I &s;hall
go to hell to be &s;ure, for being con|&s;arned
like in my own moorder;
that I will: &s;o I will: for a plague
on it, I had no bu&s;ine&s;s with the va|garies
of this crazy-peated mea&s;ter
of mine, a pox on him, &s;ay I.&endq;</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t fini&s;hed this &s;oliloquy
as he entered the apartment of his
ma&s;ter, who de&s;ired to know what
was become of his armour. Timo|thy,
under&s;tanding that it had been
left in the room when the knight
undre&s;&s;ed, began to &s;cratch his head
in great perplexity; and at la&s;t de|clared
it as his opinion that it mu&s;t
have been carried off by witchcraft.
Then he related his adventure with
Tom Clarke, who he &s;aid was con|veyed
<PB N="150" REF="155">
to his bed&s;ide he knew not
how; and concluded, with affirm|ing
they were no better than Pa|pi&s;hes,
who did not believe in witch|craft.
Sir Launcelot could not help
&s;miling at his &s;implicity; but a&s;&s;um|ing
a peremptory air, he commanded
him to fetch the armour without de|lay,
that he might afterwards &s;addle
the hor&s;es, in order to pro&s;ecute their
journey. Timothy retired in great
tribulation to the kitchen, where
finding the mi&s;anthrope, whom the
noi&s;e had al&s;o di&s;turbed, and &s;till im|pre&s;&s;ed
with the notion of his being
a conjurer, he offered him a &s;hilling
if he would ca&s;t a figure, and let him
know what was become of his ma|&s;ter's
armour.</P>
<P>Ferret, in hope of producing more
mi&s;chief, informed him without he&s;i|tation,
that one of the company had
conveyed it into the chancel of the
church, where he would now find
it depo&s;ited; at the &s;ame time pre|&s;enting
him with the key, which
<PB N="151" REF="156">
Mr. Fillet had left in his cu&s;tody.
The &s;quire, who was none of tho&s;e
who &s;et hobgoblins at defiance, be|ing
afraid to enter the church alone
at the&s;e hours, bargained with the
o&s;tler to accompany and light him
with a lanthorn. Thus attended, he
advanced to the place, where the
armour lay in a heap, and loaded it
upon the back of his attendant with|out
mole&s;tation, the launce being
&s;houldered over the whole. In
this equipage they were ju&s;t going
to retire, when the o&s;tler hearing a
noi&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance, wheeled a|bout
with &s;uch velocity, that one
end of the &s;pear &s;aluting Crab&s;haw's
pate, the poor &s;quire mea&s;ured his
length on the ground; and cru&s;hing
the lanthorn in his fall, the light was
extingui&s;hed. The other, terrified
at the&s;e effects of his own &s;udden
motion, threw down his burthen,
and would have betaken him&s;elf to
flight, had not Crab&s;haw laid fa&s;t
hold on his leg, that he him&s;elf
might not be de&s;erted. The &s;ound
<PB N="152" REF="157">
of the pieces clattering on the pave|ment,
rou&s;ed captain Crowe from a
trance or &s;lumber in which he had
lain &s;ince the apparition vani&s;hed;
and he hollowed, or rather bellow|ed,
with va&s;t vociferation. Timo|thy
and his friend were &s;o intimi|dated
by this terrific &s;train, that
they thought no more of the ar|mour,
but ran home arm in arm,
and appeared in the kitchen with
all the marks of horror and con&s;ter|nation.</P>
<P>When Sir Launcelot came forth
wrapped in his cloak, and demanded
his arms, Crab&s;haw declared that
the devil had them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;
and this a&s;&s;ertion was confirmed by
the o&s;tler, who pretended to know
the devil by his roar. Ferret &s;at in
his corner, maintaining the mo&s;t
mortifying &s;ilence, and enjoying the
impatience of the knight, who in
vain reque&s;ted an explanation of this
my&s;tery. At length his eyes began
to lighten, when &s;eizing Crab&s;haw
in one hand, and the o&s;tler in the
<PB N="153" REF="158">
other, he &s;wore by heaven he would
da&s;h their &s;ouls out, and raze the
hou&s;e to the foundation, if they did
not in&s;tantly di&s;clo&s;e the particulars
of this tran&s;action. The good wo|man
fell on her knees, prote&s;ting, in
the name of the Lord, that &s;he was
innocent as the child unborn, thof
&s;he had lent the captain a Prayer
Book to learn the Lord's Prayer, a
lanthorn and candle to light him to
the church, and a couple of clean
&s;heets for the u&s;e of the other gen|tlemen.
The knight was more and
more puzzled by this declaration;
when Mr. Clarke, coming into the
kitchen, pre&s;ented him&s;elf with a
low obei&s;ance to his old patron.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot's anger was imme|diately
converted into &s;urprize. He
&s;et at liberty the &s;quire and the
o&s;tler; and &s;tretching out his hand
to the lawyer, &startq;My good friend
Clarke, (&s;aid he) how came you
hither? Can you &s;olve this knotty
point which hath involved us all in
&s;uch confu&s;ion?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="159">
Tom forthwith began a very cir|cum&s;tantial
recapitulation of what
had happened to his uncle; in what
manner he had been di&s;appointed
of the e&s;tate; how he had acciden|tally
&s;een his honour, been ena|moured
of his character, and be|come
ambitious of following his ex|ample.
Then he related the par|ticulars
of the plan which had been
laid down to divert him from his
de&s;ign, and concluded with a&s;&s;uring
the knight, that the captain was a
very hone&s;t man, though he &s;eemed
to be a little di&s;ordered in his intel|lects.
&startq;I believe it, (replied Sir
Launcelot): madne&s;s and hone&s;ty are
not incompatible&mdash;indeed I feel it by
experience.&endq;</P>
<P>Tom proceeded to ask pardon, in
his uncle's name, for his having
made &s;o free with the knight's ar|mour;
and begged his honour, for
the love of God, would u&s;e his au|thority
with Crowe that he might quit
all thoughts of knight-errantry, for
which he was by no means quali|fied;
<PB N="155" REF="160">
for being totally ignorant of
the laws of the land, he would be
continually committing tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and
bring him&s;elf into trouble. He
&s;aid in ca&s;e he &s;hould prove refrac|tory,
he might be apprehended by
virtue of a friendly warrant, for
having feloniou&s;ly carried off the
knight's accoutrements. &startq;Taking
away another man's moveables, (&s;aid
he) and per&s;onal goods again&s;t the
will of the owner, is <HI>furtum</HI> and fe|lony
according to the &s;tatute: dif|ferent
indeed from robbery, which
implies putting in fear on the king's
highway, <HI>in alta via regia violenter,
&amp; felonice captum &amp; a&s;portatum in
magnum terrorem, &amp;c.</HI> for if the rob|bery
be laid in the indictment as done
<HI>in quadam via pede&s;tri,</HI> in a foot-path,
the offender will not be ou&s;ted of
his clergy. It mu&s;t be <HI>in alta via
regia;</HI> and your honour will plea&s;e
to take notice, that robberies com|mitted
on the river Thames, are ad|judged
as done <HI>in alta via regia;</HI> for
<PB N="156" REF="161">
the king's high&s;tream is all the &s;ame
as the king's highway.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot could not help &s;mil|ing
at Tom's learned inve&s;tigation.
He congratulated him on the pro|gre&s;s
he had made in the &s;tudy of
the law. He expre&s;&s;ed his concern
at the &s;trange turn the captain had
taken; and promi&s;ed to u&s;e his in|fluence
in per&s;uading him to de&s;i&s;t
from the prepo&s;terous de&s;ign he had
formed. The lawyer thus a&s;&s;ured,
repaired immediately to the church,
accompanied by the &s;quire, and held
a parley with his uncle, who, when
he under&s;tood that the knight in per|&s;on
de&s;ired a conference, &s;urrender|ed
up the arms quietly, and return|ed
to the publick-hou&s;e. Sir Laun|celot
received the hone&s;t &s;eaman with
his u&s;ual complacency; and perceiv|ing
great di&s;compo&s;ure in his looks,
&s;aid, he was &s;orry to hear he had
pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch a di&s;agreeable night to &s;o
little purpo&s;e. Crowe, having re|cruited
his &s;pirits with a bumper of
brandy, thanked him for his con|cern
<PB N="157" REF="162">
and ob&s;erved that he had pa&s;|&s;ed
many a hard night in his time;
but &s;uch another as this, he would
not be bound to weather for the
command of the whole Briti&s;h navy.
&startq;I have &s;een Davy Jones in the
&s;hape of a blue flame, d'ye &s;ee, hop|ping
to and fro, on the fprit&s;ail yard
arm; and I've &s;een your Jacks o'the
Lanthorn, and Wills o'the Wi&s;p,
and many &s;uch &s;pirits, both by &s;ea
and land: but, to-night I've been
boarded by all the devils and damn'd
&s;ouls in hell, &s;queaking and &s;qual|ling,
and glimmering and glaring.
Bounce, went the door&mdash;crack, went
the pew&mdash;cra&s;h, came the tackle&mdash;white-&s;heeted
gho&s;ts dancing in one
corner by the glow-worm's light&mdash;black
devils hobbling in another&mdash;Lord,
have mercy upon us! and I
was hailed, Tom, I was, by my
grand-mother Jane, and my aunt
Bridget, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;a couple of damn'd
&mdash;but they're roa&s;ting; that's one
comfort, my lad.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="163">
When he had thus di&s;burthened
his con&s;cience, Sir Launcelot intro|duced
the &s;ubject of the new occu|pation
at which he a&s;pired. &startq;I
under&s;tand, &s;aid he, that you are
de&s;irous of treading the paths of er|rantry,
which I a&s;&s;ure you, are thor|ny
and trouble&s;ome. Neverthele&s;s,
as your purpo&s;e is to exerci&s;e your
humanity and benevolence, &s;o your
ambition is commendable. But to|wards
the practice of chivalry, there
is &s;omething more required than
the virtues of courage and genero&s;i|ty.
A knight-errant ought to un|der&s;tand
the &s;ciences, to be ma&s;ter of
ethics or morality, to be well ver&s;ed
in theology, a complete ca&s;ui&s;t, and
minutely acquainted with the laws
of his country. He &s;hould not only
be patient of cold, hunger, and fa|tigue,
righteous, ju&s;t, and valiant;
but al&s;o cha&s;te, religious, tempe|rate,
polite, and conver&s;able; and
have all his pa&s;&s;ions under the rein,
except love, who&s;e empire he &s;hould
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ively acknowledge. He &s;aid,
<PB N="159" REF="164">
this was the very e&s;&s;ence of chivalry,
and no man had ever made &s;uch a
profe&s;&s;ion of arms, without having
fir&s;t placed his affection upon &s;ome
beauteous object, for who&s;e honour,
and at who&s;e command, he would
chearfully encounter the mo&s;t dread|ful
perils.</P>
<P>He took notice that nothing could
be more irregular than the manner
in which Crowe had attempted to
keep his vigil: for he had never
&s;erved his noviciate&mdash;he had not
prepared him&s;elf with ab&s;tinence and
prayer&mdash;he had not provided a qua|lified
godfather for the ceremony of
dubbing&mdash;he had no armour of his
own to wake; but, on the very thre|&s;hold
of chivalry, which is the per|fection
of ju&s;tice, had unju&s;tly pur|loined
the arms of another knight:
that this was a meer mockery of a
religious in&s;titution; and therefore
unplea&s;ing in the &s;ight of heaven;
witne&s;s, the demons and hobgoblins
that were permitted to di&s;turb and
torment him in his trial.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="165">
Crowe having li&s;tened to the&s;e re|marks,
with earne&s;t attention, re|plied,
after &s;ome he&s;itation: &startq;I am
bound to you, brother, for your kind
and chri&s;tian coun&s;el&mdash;I doubt as
how I've &s;teered by a wrong chart,
d'ye &s;ee&mdash;as for the matter of the
&s;ciences, to be &s;ure, I know plain
&s;ailing and mercator; and am an in|different
good &s;eamen, thof I &s;ay it
that &s;hould not &s;ay it: but as to all
the re&s;t, no better than the viol
block or the geer cap&s;tan. Religion
I han't much over-hauled; and we
tars laugh at your polite conver&s;a|tion,
thof, mayhap, we can chaunt
a few ballads to keep the hands
awake in the night watch; then for
cha&s;tity, brother, I doubt that's not
to be expected in a &s;ailor ju&s;t come
a-&s;hore, after a long voyage&mdash;&s;ure
all tho&s;e poor hearts won't be damn|ed
for &s;teering in the wake of na|ture.
As for a &s;weet-heart, Bet
Mizen of St. Catherine's would fit
me to a hair&mdash;&s;he and I are old
me&s;&s;mates; and&mdash;what &s;ignifies talk|ing,
<PB N="161" REF="166">
brother, &s;he knows already the
trim of my ve&s;&s;el, d'ye &s;ee.&endq; He
concluded with &s;aying, &startq;He thought
he wa'n't too old to learn; and if Sir
Launcelot would take him in tow,
as his tender, he would &s;tand by him
all weathers, and it &s;hould not co&s;t
his con&s;ort a farthing's expence.&endq;</P>
<P>The knight &s;aid, he did not think
him&s;elf of con&s;equence enough to
have &s;uch a pupil; but &s;hould al|ways
be ready to give him his be&s;t
advice, as a &s;pecimen of which he
exhorted him to weigh all the cir|cum&s;tances,
and deliberate calmly
and lei&s;urely, before he actually en|gaged
in &s;uch a boi&s;terous profe&s;&s;ion,
a&s;&s;uring him that if, at the end of
three months, his re&s;olution &s;hould
continue, he would take upon him|&s;elf
the office of his in&s;tructor. In
the mean time, he gratified the ho|&s;te&s;s
for his lodging, put on his ar|mour,
took leave of the company,
and mounting Bronzomarte, proceed|ed
&s;outherly, being attended by his

&s;quire Crab&s;haw, grumbling on the
back of Gilbert.</P>

<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which is within a hair's breadth of
proving highly intere&s;ting.</HEAD>
<P>LEAVING captain Crowe and
his nephew for the pre&s;ent,
though they and even the mi&s;an|thrope
will reappear in due &s;ea&s;on,
we are now obliged to attend the
progre&s;s of the knight, who pro|ceeded
in a &s;outherly direction, in|&s;en&s;ible
of the &s;torm that blew, as
well as of the darkne&s;s, which was
horrible. For &s;ome time Crrb&s;haw
ejaculated cur&s;es in &s;ilence; till at
length his anger gave way to his fear,
which waxed &s;o &s;trong upon him,
that he could no longer re&s;i&s;t the
de&s;ire of alleviating it, by entering
into a conver&s;ation with his ma&s;ter.
By way of introduction, he gave
Gilbert the &s;pur, directing him to|wards
the flank of Bronzomarte,
<PB N="163" REF="168">
which he encountered with &s;uch a
&s;hock, that the knight was almo&s;t
di&s;mounted. When Sir Launcelot,
with &s;ome warmth, a&s;ked the rea|&s;on
of this attack, the &s;quire replied
in the&s;e words: &startq;The devil, (God
ble&s;s us) mun be playing his pranks
with Gilbert too, as &s;ure as I'm a
living &s;oul!&mdash;I'&s;e wage a tea&s;ter,
the foul fiend has left the &s;eaman,
and got into Gilbert, that he has
&mdash;when a has pa&s;&s;ed through an

bea&s;t a will get into next.&endq; &startq;Pro|bably
into a mule, (&s;aid the knight;)
in that ca&s;e you will be in &s;ome
danger&mdash;but I can, at any time,
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s you with a hor&s;ewhip.&endq;&mdash;
&startq;Aye, aye, (an&s;wered Timothy)
your honour has a mortal good
hand at giving a flap with a fox's
tail, as the &s;aying is&mdash;'tis a won|derment
you did not try your hand
on that there wi&s;eacre that &s;tole
your honour's harne&s;s, and wants
to be an arrant with a murrain to
'un&mdash;Lord help his fool's head!
<PB N="164" REF="169">
it becomes him as a &s;ow doth a cart|&s;addle.&endq;
&startq;There is no guilt in
infirmity (&s;aid the knight;) I puni&s;h
the vicious only.&endq; &startq;I would your
honour would puni&s;h Gilbert then,
(cried the &s;quire) for 'tis the mo&s;t
vicious tuoad that ever I laid a leg
over&mdash;but as to that &s;ame &s;ea|faring
man, what may his di&s;tem|per
be?&endq; &startq;Madne&s;s;&endq; (an&s;wered
Sir Launcelot.) &startq;Bodikins, (ex|claimed
the &s;quire) I doubt as how
other volks are leame of the &s;ame
leg&mdash;but a'n't vor &s;uch &s;mall gen|try

leave that to their betters.&endq; &startq;You
&s;eem to hint at me, Crab&s;haw: do

may &s;ay as how I have looked your
honour in the mouth; and a &s;orry
dog &s;hould I be, if I did not know
your humours as well as I know
e'er a bea&s;t in the &s;teable at Greave&s;|bury-hall.&endq;
&startq;Since you are &s;o
well acquainted with my madne&s;s,
(&s;aid the knight) what opinion have
you of your&s;elf, who &s;erve and fol|low
<PB N="165" REF="170">
low a lunatic?&endq; &startq;I hope I han't
&s;erved your honour for nothing,
but I &s;hall inherit &s;ome of your ca&s;t
vagaries&mdash;when your honour is
plea&s;ed to be mad, I &s;hould be very
&s;orry to be found right in my &s;en&s;es.
Timothy Crab&s;haw will never eat
the bread of unthankfulne&s;s&mdash;It
&s;hall never be &s;aid of him that he
was wi&s;er than his mea&s;ter: as for
the matter of following a madman,
we may &s;ay your honour's face is
made of a fiddle; every one that
looks on you loves you.&endq; This com|pliment
the knight returned by &s;aying,
&startq;If my face is a fiddle, Crab&s;haw,
your tongue is a fiddle-&s;tick that
plays upon it&mdash;yet your mu&s;ic is very
di&s;agreeable&mdash;you don't keep time.&endq;
&startq;Nor you neither, mea&s;ter, (cried
Timothy) or we &s;houldn't be here
wandering about under cloud of night,
like &s;heep-&s;tealers, or evil &s;pirits with
troubled con&s;ciences.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the di&s;cour&s;e was inter|rupted
by a &s;udden di&s;a&s;ter, in con|&s;equence
of which the &s;quire uttered
<PB N="166" REF="171">
an inarticulate roar that &s;tartled the
knight him&s;elf, who was very little
&s;ubject to the &s;en&s;ation of fear: but
his &s;urprize was changed into vex|ation
when he perceived Gilbert
without a rider pa&s;&s;ing by, and
kicking his heels with great agility.
He forthwith turned his &s;teed, and,
riding back a few paces, found Crab|&s;haw
ri&s;ing from the ground. When
he a&s;ked what was become of his
hor&s;e, he an&s;wered in a whimpering
tone, &startq;Hor&s;e! would I could once
&s;ee him fairly carrion for the hounds
&mdash;for my part I believe as how 'tis
no hor&s;e but a devil incarnate; and
yet I've been wor&s;e mounted, that I
have&mdash;I'd like to have rid a hor&s;e
that was foaled of an acorn.&endq;</P>
<P>This accident happened in a hollow
way, over&s;hadowed with trees, one of
which the &s;torm had blown down, &s;o
that it lay over the road, and one of
its boughs projecting horizontally,
encountered the &s;quire as he trotted
along in the dark. Chancing to
<PB N="167" REF="172">
hitch under his long chin, he could
not di&s;engage him&s;elf; but hung
&s;u&s;pended like a flitch of bacon;
while Gilbert, pu&s;hing forward, left
him dangling, and, by his aukward
gambols, &s;eemed to be plea&s;ed with
the joke. This capricious animal
was not retaken without the per&s;o|nal
endeavours of the knight: for
Crab&s;haw ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing to budge
a foot from his honour's &s;ide, he
was obliged to alight, and fa&s;ten
Bronzomarte to a tree: then they
&s;et out together, and with &s;ome dif|ficulty
found Gilbert with his neck
&s;tretched over a five barred gate,
&s;nuffing up the morning-air. The
&s;quire, however, was not remount|ed,
without having fir&s;t undergone
a &s;evere reprehen&s;ion from his ma&s;|ter,
who upbraided him with his
cowardice, threatened to cha&s;ti&s;e him
on the &s;pot, and declared that he
would divorce his da&s;tardly &s;oul from
his body, &s;hould he ever be incom|moded
or affronted with another in|&s;tance
<PB N="168" REF="173">
of his ba&s;e-born apprehen&s;ion.
Though there was &s;ome ri&s;que in
carrying on the altercation at this
juncture, Timothy having bound up
his jaws, could not with&s;tand the in|clination
he had to confute his ma&s;ter.
He therefore, in a muttering ac|cent,
prote&s;ted that if the knight
would give him leave, he &s;hould
prove that his honour had tied a knot
with his tongue which he could not
untie with all his teeth. &startq;How,
caitiff, (cried Sir Launcelot) pre|&s;ume
to contend with me in argu|ment!&endq;
&startq;Your mouth is &s;carce
&s;hut, (&s;aid the other) &s;ince you de|clared
that a man was not to be pu|ni&s;hed
for madne&s;s, becau&s;e it was
a di&s;temper: now I will maintain
that cowardice is a di&s;temper as well
as madne&s;s; for nobody would be
afraid if he could help it.&endq; &startq;There
is more logic in that remark (re&s;umed
the knight) than I expected from your
clod-pate, Crab&s;haw: but I mu&s;t ex|plain
the difference between cowar|dice
and madne&s;s. Cowardice, tho'
<PB N="169" REF="174">
&s;ometimes the effect of natural imbe|cility,
is generally a prejudice of edu|cation,
or bad habit contracted from
mi&s;information, or mi&s;apprehen&s;ion,
and may certainly be cured by expe|rience,
and the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on:
but this remedy cannot be applied in
madne&s;s, which is a privation or di&s;|order
of rea&s;on it&s;elf.&endq; &startq;So is cow|ardice,
as I'm a living &s;oul, (ex|claimed
the &s;quire) don't you &s;ay a
man is frightened out of his &s;en&s;es?
for my peart, mea&s;ter, I can neither
&s;ee nor hear, much le&s;s argufy when
I'm in &s;uch a quandary: where|fore,
I believe, odds bodikins! that
cowardice and madne&s;s are both di|&s;tempers,
and differ no more than
the hot and cold fits of an ague.
When it teakes your honour, you're
all heat and fire and fury, Lord ble&s;s
us! but when it catches poor Tim,
he's cold and dead-hearted, he &s;heakes
and &s;hivers like an a&s;pen-leaf, that
he does.&endq; &startq;In that ca&s;e, (an|&s;wered
the knight) I &s;hall not puni&s;h
you for the di&s;temper which you can|not
<PB N="170" REF="175">
help, but for engaging in a &s;er|vice
expo&s;ed to perils, when you knew
your own infirmity: in the &s;ame
manner as a man de&s;erves puni&s;hment,
who enli&s;ts him&s;elf for a &s;oldier, while
he labours under any &s;ecret di&s;ea&s;e.&endq;
&startq;At that rate (&s;aid the &s;quire) my
bread is like to be rarely buttered
o'both &s;ides, I faith. But, I hope,
as by the ble&s;&s;ing of God I have
run mad, &s;o I &s;hall in good time
grow valiant, under your honour's
precept and example.&endq;</P>
<P>By this time a very di&s;agreeable
night was &s;ucceeded by a fair, bright
morning, and a market-town appear|ed
at the di&s;tance of three or four
miles, when Crab&s;haw, having no
longer the fear of hobgoblins before
his eyes, and being moreover cheared
by the &s;ight of a place where he
hoped to meet with comfortable en|tertainment,
began to talk big, to ex|patiate
on the folly of being afraid,
and finally &s;et all danger at defiance;
when all of a &s;udden he was pre&s;ent|ed
with an opportunity of putting in
<PB N="171" REF="176">
practice tho&s;e new adopted maxims.
In an opening between two lanes,
they perceived a gentleman's coach
&s;topped by two highwaymen on
hor&s;eback, one of whom advanced to
reconnoitre and keep the coa&s;t clear,
while the other exacted contribution
from the travellers in the coach.
He who acted as centinel, no &s;ooner
&s;aw our adventurer appearing from
the lane, than he rode up with a
pi&s;tol in his hand, and ordered him to
halt on pain of immediate death.</P>
<P>To this peremptory mandate the
knight made no other reply than
charging him with &s;uch impetuo&s;i|ty
that he was unhor&s;ed in a twink|ling,
and lay &s;prawling on the ground,
&s;eemingly &s;ore brui&s;ed with his fall.
Sir Launcelot commanding Timothy
to alight and &s;ecure the pri&s;oner,
couched his launce, and rode full
&s;peed at the other highwayman, who
was not a little di&s;turbed at &s;ight of
&s;uch an apparition. Neverthele&s;s, he
fired his pi&s;tol without effect; and,
clapping &s;purs to his hor&s;e, fled away
<PB N="172" REF="177">
at full gallop. The knight pur&s;ued
him with all the &s;peed that Bronzo|marte
could exert; but the robber
being mounted on a &s;wift hunter,
kept him at a di&s;tance; and, after a
chace of &s;everal miles, e&s;caped thro'
a wood &s;o entangled with coppice,
that Sir Launcelot thought proper to
de&s;i&s;t. He then, for the fir&s;t time,
recollected the &s;ituation in which he
had left the other thief, and remem|bering
to have heard a female &s;hriek,
as he pa&s;&s;ed by the coach-window,
re&s;olved to return with all expedition,
that he might make a proffer of his
&s;ervice to the lady, according to the
obligation of knight-errantry. But
he had lo&s;t his way; and after an
hour's ride, during which he traver&s;ed
many a field, and circled divers hedges,
he found him&s;elf in the market-town
aforementioned. Here the fir&s;t object
that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his eyes, was
Crab&s;haw, on foot, &s;urrounded by a
mob, tearing his hair, &s;tamping with
his feet, and roaring out in manife&s;t
di&s;traction, &startq;Shew me the mayor,
<PB N="173" REF="178">
(for the love of God) &s;hew me the
mayor!&mdash;O Gilbert, Gilbert! a mur|rain
take thee, Gilbert! &s;ure thou
wa&s;t foaled for my de&s;truction!&endq;</P>
<P>From the&s;e exclamations, and the
antic dre&s;s of the &s;quire, the people,
not without rea&s;on, concluded that
the poor &s;oul had lo&s;t his wits; and
the beadle was ju&s;t going to &s;ecure
him, when the knight interpo&s;ed, and
at once attracted the whole attention
of the populace. Timothy, &s;eeing
his ma&s;ter, fell down on his knees,
crying &startq;The thief has run away with
Gilbert&mdash;you may pound me into a
pea&s;t, as the &s;aying is: but now I'&s;e
as mad as your wor&s;hip; an't afeard
of the devil and all his works.&endq; Sir
Launcelot de&s;iring the beadle would
forbear, was in&s;tantly obeyed by that
officer, who had no inclination to put
the authority of his place in competi|tion
with the power of &s;uch a figure
armed at all points, mounted on a
fiery &s;teed, and ready for the combat.
He ordered Crab&s;haw to attend him
to the next inn, where he alighted;
<PB N="174" REF="179">
then taking him into a &s;eparate apart|ment,
demanded an explanation of
the unconnected words he had uttered.
The &s;quire was in &s;uch agitation, that,
with infinite difficulty, and by dint of
a thou&s;and different que&s;tions, his
ma&s;ter learned the adventure to this
effect: Crab&s;haw, according to Sir
Launcelot's command, had alighted
from his hor&s;e, and drawn his cutla&s;s,
in hope of intimidating the di&s;com|fited
robber into a tame &s;urrender,
though he did not at all reli&s;h the na|ture
of the &s;ervice: but the thief was
neither &s;o much hurt, nor &s;o tame as
Timothy had imagined. He &s;tarted
on his feet with his pi&s;tol &s;till in his
hand; and pre&s;enting it to the &s;quire,
&s;wore with dreadful imprecations, that
he would blow his brains out in an
in&s;tant. Crab&s;haw, unwilling to ha|zard
the trial of this experiment, turn|ed
his back, and fled with great pre|cipitation;
while the robber, who&s;e
hor&s;e had run away, mounted Gilbert,
and rode off acro&s;s the country. It
was at this period, that two footmen
<PB N="175" REF="180">
belonging to the coach, who had
&s;tayed behind to take their morning's
whet, at the inn where they lodged,
came up to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the la|dies,
armed with blunderbu&s;&s;es; and
the carriage proceeded, leaving Ti|mothy
alone in di&s;traction and de|&s;pair.
He knew not which way to
turn, and was afraid of remaining on
the &s;pot, le&s;t the robbers &s;hould come
back and revenge them&s;elves upon
him for the di&s;appointment they had
undergone. In this di&s;tre&s;s, the fir&s;t
thought that occurred, was to make
the be&s;t of his way to the town, and
demand the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the civil
magi&s;trate towards the retrieval of
what he had lo&s;t: a de&s;ign which he
executed in &s;uch a manner, as ju&s;tly
entailed upon him the imputation of
lunacy.</P>
<P>While Timothy &s;tood fronting the
window, and an&s;wering the interro|gations
of his ma&s;ter, he &s;uddenly
exclaimed, &startq;Bodikins! there's Gil|bert!&endq;
and &s;prung into the &s;treet with
incredible agility. There finding his
<PB N="176" REF="181">
&s;trayed companion brought back by
one of the footmen who attended the
coach, he imprinted a ki&s;s on his
forehead; and hanging about his neck,
with the tears in his eyes, hailed his
return with the following &s;alutation:
&startq;Art thou come back, my darling?
ah Gilbert, Gilbert! a pize upon thee!
thou had&s;t like to have been a dear
Gilbert to me! how could&s;t thou
break the heart of thy old friend,
who has known thee from a colt?
&s;even years next gra&s;s have I fed thee
and bred thee; provided thee with
&s;weet hay, delicate corn, and fre&s;h
litter, that thou mought lie warm,
dry, and confortable. Ha'n't I cur|rycombed
thy carca&s;e 'till it was as
&s;leek as a &s;loe, and cheri&s;hed thee as
the apple of mine eye? for all that
thou ha&s;t played me an hundred
dog's-tricks; biting, and kicking, and
plunging, as if the devil was in thy
body; and now thou could&s;t run a|way
with a thief, and leave me to be
flea'd alive by ma&s;ter: what can&s;t
thou &s;ay for thy&s;elf, thou cruel, hard|hearted,
<PB N="177" REF="182">
unchri&s;tian tuoad!&endq; To this
tender expo&s;tulation, which afforded
much entertainment to the boys, Gil|bert
an&s;wered not one word; but
&s;eemed altogether in&s;en&s;ible to the
care&s;&s;es of Timothy, who forthwith
led him into the &s;table. On the
whole, he &s;eems to have been an un|&s;ocial
animal: for it does not appear
that he ever contracted any degree of
intimacy, even with Bronzomarte, du|ring
the whole cour&s;e of their ac|quaintance
and fellow&s;hip. On the
contrary, he has been more than once
known to &s;ignify his aver&s;ion by
throwing out behind, and other erup|tive
marks of contempt for that ele|gant
charger, who excelled him as
much in per&s;onal merit, as his rider
Timothy was out&s;hone by his all|accompli&s;hed
ma&s;ter. While the
&s;quire accommodated Gilbert in the
&s;table, the knight &s;ent for the foot|man
who had brought him back;
and, having pre&s;ented him with a li|beral
acknowledgment, de&s;ired to
<PB N="178" REF="183">
in what manner the hor&s;e had been
retrieved.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger &s;atisfied him in this
particular, by giving him to under|&s;tand,
that the highwayman, perceiv|ing
him&s;elf pur&s;ued acro&s;s the coun|try,
plied Gilbert &s;o &s;everely with
whip and &s;pur, that the animal re|&s;ented
the u&s;age, and being be&s;ides,
perhaps, a little &s;truck with remor&s;e
for having left his old friend Crab|&s;haw,
&s;uddenly halted, and &s;tood
&s;tock &s;till, notwith&s;tanding all the
&s;tripes and tortures he underwent; or
if he moved at all, it was in a re|trograde
direction. The thief, &s;ee|ing
all his endeavours ineffectual, and
him&s;elf in danger of being overtaken,
wi&s;ely quitted his acqui&s;ition, and fled
into the bo&s;om of a neighbouring
wood.</P>
<P>Then the knight inquired about
the &s;ituation of the lady in the coach,
and offered him&s;elf as her guard and
conductor: but was told that &s;he was
already &s;afely lodged in the hou&s;e of
<PB N="179" REF="184">
a gentleman at &s;ome di&s;tance from the
road. He likewi&s;e learned that &s;he
was a per&s;on di&s;ordered in her &s;en&s;es,
under the care and tuition of a widow
lady her relation; and that in a day
or two they &s;hould pur&s;ue their jour|ney
northward to the place of her
habitation. After the footman had
been &s;ome time di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the knight
recollected that he had forgot to a&s;k
the name of the per&s;on to whom he
belonged; and began to be unea&s;y at
this omi&s;&s;ion, which indeed was more
intere&s;ting than he could imagine:
for an explanation of this nature would
in all likelihood, have led to a di&s;co|very,
that the lady in the coach was
no other than Mi&s;s Aurelia Darnel,
who &s;eeing him unexpectedly in &s;uch
an equipage and attitude, as he pa&s;&s;ed
the coach, (for his helmet was off)
had &s;creamed with &s;urprize and terror,
and fainted away. Neverthele&s;s,
when &s;he recovered from her &s;woon,
&s;he concealed the real cau&s;e of her
agitation, and none of her attendants
<PB N="180" REF="185">
were acquainted with the per&s;on of
Sir Launcelot.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the di&s;order,
under which &s;he was &s;aid to labour,
&s;hall be revealed in due cour&s;e. In
the mean time, our adventurer, though
unaccountably affected, never dreamed
of &s;uch an occurrence; but being
very much fatigued, re&s;olved to in|demnify
him&s;elf for the lo&s;s of la&s;t
night's repo&s;e; and this happened to
be one of the few things in which
Crab&s;haw felt an ambition to follow
his ma&s;ter's example.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which may &s;erve to &s;hew, that true pa|trioti&s;m
is of no party.</HEAD>
<P>THE knight had not enjoyed his
repo&s;e above two hours, when
he was di&s;turbed by &s;uch a variety of
noi&s;es, as might have di&s;compo&s;ed a
brain of the firme&s;t texture. The
rumbling of carriages, and the rattling
of hor&s;es feet on the pavement, was
<PB N="181" REF="186">
intermingled with loud &s;houts, and
the noi&s;e of fiddle, french-horn, and
bagpipe. A loud peal was heard
ringing in the church-tower, at &s;ome
di&s;tance, while the inn refounded with
clamour, confu&s;ion, and uproar.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot being thus alarmed,
&s;tarted from his bed, and running to
the window, beheld a cavalcade of
per&s;ons well mounted, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by blue cockades. They
were generally attired like jockies,
with gold-laced hats and buck&s;kin
breeches, and one of them bore a
&s;tandard of blue &s;ilk, in&s;cribed in
white letters, LIBERTY AND THE
LANDED INTEREST. He who rode
at their head was a jolly figure, of a
florid complexion and round belly,
&s;eemingly turned of fifty, and, in all
appearance, of a choleric di&s;po&s;ition.
As they approached the market-place
they waved their hats, huzza'd, and
cried aloud, No FOREIGN CONNEC|TIONS,&mdash;OLD-ENGLAND
FOR EVER.
This acclamation, however, was not
&s;o loud or univer&s;al, but that our ad|venturer
<PB N="182" REF="187">
could di&s;tinctly hear a coun|ter-cry
from the populace, of NO
SLAVERY,&mdash;NO POPISH PRETENDER.
An in&s;inuation &s;o ill reli&s;hed by the
cavaliers, that they began to ply their
hor&s;ewhips among the multitude, and
were, in their turn, &s;aluted with a
di&s;charge or volley of &s;tones, dirt, and
dead cats; in con&s;equence of which
&s;ome teeth were demoli&s;hed, and ma|ny
&s;urtouts defiled.</P>
<P>Our adventurer's attention was &s;oon
called off from this &s;cene, to contem|plate
another proce&s;&s;ion of people on
foot, adorned with bunches of orange
ribbons, attended by a regular band of
mu&s;ick, playing <HI>God &s;ave great George
our king,</HI> and headed by a thin, &s;war|thy
per&s;onage, of a &s;allow a&s;pect and
large goggling eyes, arched over with
two thick &s;emicircles of hair, or ra|ther
bri&s;tles, jet black, and frowzy.
His apparel was very gorgeous, though
his addre&s;s was aukward; he was ac|companied
by the mayor, recorder,
and heads of the corporation, in their
formalities. His en&s;igns were known
<PB N="183" REF="188">
by the in&s;cription, <HI>Liberty of Con|&s;cience
and the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion;</HI>
and the people &s;aluted him as he pa&s;&s;ed
with repeated cheers, that &s;eemed to
progno&s;ticate &s;ucce&s;s. He had par|ticularly
ingratiated him&s;elf with the
good women, who lined the &s;treet,
and &s;ent forth many ejaculatory pe|titions
in his favour.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot immediately compre|hended
the meaning of this &s;olemni|ty:
he perceived it was the prelude
to the election of a member to repre|&s;ent
the county in parliament, and he
was &s;eized with an eager de&s;ire to
know the names and characters of the
competitors. In order to gratify this
de&s;ire, he made repeated application
to the bell-rope that depended from
the cieling of his apartment; but this
produced nothing, except the repeti|tion
of the words &startq;Coming, Sir,&endq;
which ecchoed from three or four dif|ferent
corners of the hou&s;e. The
waiters were &s;o di&s;tracted by a variety
of calls, that they &s;tood motionle&s;s,
in the &s;tate of the &s;choolman's a&s;s be|tween
<PB N="184" REF="189">
two bundles of hay, incapable
of determining where they &s;hould fir&s;t
offer their attendance.</P>
<P>Our knight's patience was almo&s;t
exhau&s;ted, when Crab&s;haw entered
the room, in a very &s;trange equipage:
one half of his face appeared clo&s;e
&s;haved, and the other covered with
lather, while the blood trickled in
two rivulets from his no&s;e, upon a
barber's cloth that was tucked under
his chin; he looked grim with indig|nation,
and under his left arm car|ried
his cutla&s;s, un&s;heathed. Where
he had acquired &s;o much of the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of knight-errantry we &s;hall not
pretend to determine; but, certain it
is, he fell on his knees before Sir
Launcelot, crying, with an accent of
rage and di&s;traction, &startq;In the name of
St. George for England, I beg a boon,
Sir knight, and thy compliance I de|mand,
before the peacock and the
ladies.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, a&s;toni&s;hed at this
addre&s;s, replied in a lofty &s;train, &startq;Va|liant
&s;quire, thy boon is granted, pro|vided
<PB N="185" REF="190">
it doth not contravene the laws
of the land, and the con&s;titutions of
chivalry.&endq; &startq;Then I crave leave (an|&s;wered
Crab&s;haw) to challenge and
defy to mortal combat, that caitif
barber who hath left me in this piteous
condition; and I vow by the peacock,
that I will not &s;have my beard, until
I have &s;haved his head from his &s;houl|ders:
&s;o may I thrive in the occupa|tion
of an arrant &s;quire.&endq;</P>
<P>Before his ma&s;ter had time to en|quire
into particulars, they were join|ed
by a decent man in boots, who
was likewi&s;e a traveller, and had &s;een
the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of Timothy's
di&s;a&s;ter. He gave the knight to un|&s;ter&s;tand,
that Crab&s;haw had &s;ent for
a barber, and already undergone one
half of the operation, when the ope|rator
received the long expected me&s;|&s;age
from both the gentlemen, who
&s;tood candidates at the election. The
double &s;ummons was no &s;ooner inti|mated
to him, than he threw down
his ba&s;on and retired with precipita|tion,
leaving the &s;quire in the &s;uds.
<PB N="186" REF="191">
Timothy, incen&s;ed at this de&s;ertion,
followed him with equal celerity into
the &s;treet, where he collared the &s;ha|ver,
and in&s;i&s;ted upon being entirely
trimmed, on pain of the ba&s;tinado.
The other finding him&s;elf thus arre&s;t|ed,
and having no time to &s;pare for
altercation, lifted up his fi&s;t, and di&s;|charged
it upon the &s;nout of Crab|&s;haw
with &s;uch force, that the un|fortunate
aggre&s;&s;or was fain to bite
the ground, while the victor ha&s;tened
away, in hope of touching the dou|ble
wages of corruption.</P>
<P>The knight being informed of the&s;e
circum&s;tances, told Timothy with a
&s;mile, that he &s;hould have liberty to
defy the barber, but in the mean
time, he ordered him to &s;addle Bron|zomarte,
and prepare for immediate
&s;ervice. While the &s;quire was thus
employed, his ma&s;ter engaged in
conver&s;ation with the &s;tranger, who
happened to be a London dealer tra|velling
for orders, and was well ac|quainted
with the particulars which
our adventurer wanted to know. It
<PB N="187" REF="192">
was from this communicative trade&s;|man
he learned, that the competitors
were Sir Valentine Quick&s;et and Mr.
I&s;aac Vanderpelft; the fir&s;t a mere
fox-hunter, who depended for &s;ucce&s;s
in this election upon his intere&s;t a|mong
the high-flying gentry; the o|ther
a &s;tock-jobber and contractor, of
foreign extract, not without a mixture
of Hebrew blood, immen&s;ely rich,
who was countenanced by his grace
of&mdash;, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have di|&s;tributed
large &s;ums in &s;ecuring a ma|jority
of votes among the yeomanry
of the county, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;mall free|holds,
and copyholders, a great num|ber
of which la&s;t re&s;ided in this bur|rough.
He &s;aid the&s;e were generally
di&s;&s;enters and weavers; and that the
mayor, who was him&s;elf a manufac|turer,
had received a very con&s;ider|able
order for exportation, in con&s;e|quence
of which, it was believed, he
would &s;upport Mr. Vanderpelft with
all his influence and credit.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, rouzed at this in|telligence,
called for his armour,
<PB N="188" REF="193">
which being buckled on in a hurry,
he mounted his &s;teed, attended by
Crab&s;haw on Gilbert, and rode im|mediately
into the mid&s;t of the mul|titude
by which the hu&s;tings were
&s;urrounded, ju&s;t as Sir Valentine
Quicket began to harangue the peo|ple
from an occa&s;ional theatre, form|ed
of a plank &s;upported by the upper
board of the publick &s;tocks, and an
inferior rib of a wooden cage pitched
al&s;o for the accommodation of petty
delinquents.</P>
<P>Though the &s;ingular appearance of
Sir Launcelot at fir&s;t attracted the eyes
of all the &s;pectators, yet they did not
fail to yield attention to the &s;peech of
his brother knight, Sir Valentine,
which ran in the following &s;train:
Gentlemen vreehoulders of this
here county, I &s;han't pretend to meake
a vine vlouri&s;hing &s;peech,&mdash;I'm a plain
&s;poken man, as you all know. I
hope I &s;hall always &s;peak my maind
without vear or vavour, as the zaying
is. 'Tis the way of the Quick&s;ets&mdash;we
are no up&s;tarts, nor vorreigners,
<PB N="189" REF="194">
nor have we any Jewi&s;h blood in our
veins;&mdash;we have lived in this here
neighbourhood time out of maind, as
you all know; and po&s;&s;e&s;s an e&s;tate
of vive thou&s;and clear, which we
&s;pend at whoam, among you, in old
Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality&mdash;All my voreva|thers
have been parliament-men, and
I can prove that ne'er a one o'um
gave a zingle vote for the court &s;ince
the revolution. Vor my own peart,
I value not the mini&s;try three &s;kips of
a lou&s;e, as the zaying is,&mdash;I ne'er
knew but one mini&s;ter that was an
hone&s;t man; and vor all the re&s;t I care
not if they were hanged as high as
Haman, with a pox to'un&mdash;I am,
thank God, a vree-born, true-hearted
Engli&s;hman, and a loyal, thof un|worthy,
&s;on of the church&mdash;vor all
they have done vor H&mdash;r, I'd vain
know what they have done vor the
church, with a vengeance&mdash;vor my
own peart, I hate all vorreigners, and
vorreign mea&s;ures, whereby this poor
nation is broken-backed with a di&s;mal
load of debt, and taxes ri&s;e &s;o high
<PB N="190" REF="195">
that the poor cannot get bread. Gen|tlemen
vreehoulders of this county,
I value no mini&s;ter a vig's end, d'ye
&s;ee; if you will vavour me with your
votes and intere&s;t, whereby I may
be returned, I'll engage one half of
my e&s;tate that I never cry yea to vour
&s;hillings in the pound; but will cro&s;s
the mini&s;try in every thing, as in duty
bound, and as becomes an hone&s;t
vreeholder in the ould intere&s;t&mdash;but,
if you &s;ell your votes and your coun|try
for hire, you will be dete&s;ted in
this here world, and damned in the
next to all eternity: &s;o I leave every
man to his own con&s;cience.&endq;</P>
<P>This eloquent oration was received
by his own friends with loud peals of
applau&s;e; which, however, did not di&s;|courage
his competitor, who, confident
of his own &s;trength, a&s;cended the
ro&s;trum, or, in other words, an old
ca&s;k, &s;et upright for the purpo&s;e.
Having bowed all round to the au|dience,
with a &s;mile of gentle con|de&s;cen&s;ion,
he told them, how am|bitious
he was of the honour to re|pre&s;ent
<PB N="191" REF="196">
this county in parliament;
and how happy he found him&s;elf in
the encouragement of his friends, who
had &s;o unanimou&s;ly agreed to &s;upport
his preten&s;ions. He &s;aid, over and
above the qualification he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a|mong
them, he had four&s;core thou|&s;and
pounds in his pocket, which he
had acquired by commerce, the &s;up|port
of the nation, under the pre&s;ent
happy e&s;tabli&s;hment, in defence of
which he was ready to &s;pend the la&s;t
farthing. He owned him&s;elf a faith|ful
&s;ubject to his maje&s;ty king George,
&s;incerely attached to the prote&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in dete&s;tation and defiance
of a popi&s;h, an abjured, and out|lawed
pretender; and declared that
he would exhau&s;t his &s;ub&s;tance and
his blood, if nece&s;&s;ary, in maintain|ing
the principles of the glorious re|volution.
&startq;This (cried he) is the
&s;olid ba&s;is and foundation upon which
I &s;tand.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words had &s;carce pro|ceeded
from his mouth, when the
head of the barrel or puncheon on
<PB N="192" REF="197">
which he &s;tood, being frail and in|firm,
gave way; &s;o that down he
went with a cra&s;h, and in a twinkling
di&s;appeared from the eyes of the a&s;to|ni&s;hed
beholders. The fox-hunters
perceiving his di&s;a&s;ter, exclaimed, in
the phra&s;e and accent of the chace,
&startq;Stole away! &s;tole away!&endq; and, with
hideous vociferation, joined in the &s;yl|van

<P>The di&s;a&s;ter of Mr. Vanderpelft
was &s;oon repaired by the a&s;&s;iduity of
his friends, who di&s;engaged him from
the barrel in a trice, hoi&s;ted him on
the &s;houlders of four &s;trong weavers,
and re&s;enting the unmannerly exulta|tion
of their antagoni&s;ts, began to
form them&s;elves in order of battle.
An ob&s;tinate fray would have un|doubtedly
en&s;ued, had not their mu|tual
indignation given way to their
curio&s;ity, at the motion of our knight,
who had advanced into the middle
between the two fronts, and waving
his hand, as a &s;ignal for them to give
attention, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to them
<PB N="193" REF="198">
with graceful demeanor, in the&s;e
words: &startq;Countrymen, friends, and
fellow-citizens, you are this day a&s;&s;em|bled
to determine a point of the ut|mo&s;t
con&s;equence to your&s;elves and
your po&s;terity; a point that ought to
be determined by far other weapons
than brutal force and factious clamour.
You, the freemen of England, are
the ba&s;is of that excellent con&s;titution,
which hath long flouri&s;hed the object
of envy and admiration. To you be|longs
the ine&s;timable privilege of
choo&s;ing a delegate properly qualified
to repre&s;ent you in the high court of
parliament. This is your birth-right,
inherited from your ance&s;tors, obtain|ed
by their courage, and &s;ealed with
their blood. It is not only your birth|right,
which you &s;hould maintain in
defiance of all danger, but al&s;o a &s;a|cred
tru&s;t, to be executed with the
mo&s;t &s;crupulous care and fidelity.
The per&s;on whom you tru&s;t ought
not only to be endued with the mo&s;t
inflexible integrity, but &s;hould like-wi&s;e
po&s;&s;e&s;s a fund of knowledge that
<PB N="194" REF="199">
may enable him to act as a part of
the legi&s;lature. He mu&s;t be well ac|quainted
with the hi&s;tory, the con|&s;titution,
and the laws of his coun|try:
he mu&s;t under&s;tand the forms of
bu&s;ine&s;s, the extent of the royal pre|rogative,
the privilege of parliament,
the detail of government, the nature
and regulation of the finances, the
different branches of commerce, the
politicks that prevail, and the con|nections
that &s;ub&s;i&s;t among the dif|ferent
powers of Europe: for, on all
the&s;e &s;ubjects, the deliberations of a
hou&s;e of commons occa&s;ionally turn:
but the&s;e great purpo&s;es will never be
an&s;wered by electing an illiterate &s;a|vage,
&s;carce qualified, in point of un|der&s;tanding,
to act as a country ju&s;tice
of the peace, a man who has &s;carce
ever travelled beyond the excur&s;ion of
a fox-chace, who&s;e conver&s;ation never
rambles farther than his &s;table, his
kennel, and his barn-yard; who re|jects
decorum as degeneracy, mi&s;takes
ru&s;ticity for independence, a&s;certains
his courage by leaping over gates and
<PB N="195" REF="200">
ditches, and founds his triumph on feats
of drinking; who holds his e&s;tate by a
factious tenure, profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf the
blind &s;lave of a party, without know|ing
the principles that gave it birth,
or the motives by which it is actuated,
and thinks that all patrioti&s;m con&s;i&s;ts
in railing indi&s;criminately at mini&s;ters,
and ob&s;tinately oppo&s;ing every mea|&s;ure
of the admini&s;tration. Such a
man, with no evil intentions of his
own, might be u&s;ed as a dangerous
tool in the hands of de&s;perate faction,
by &s;cattering the &s;eeds of di&s;affection,
embarra&s;&s;ing the wheels of govern|ment,
and reducing the whole king|dom
to anarchy.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the knight was interrupted
by the &s;houts and acclamations of
the Vanderpelfites, who cried aloud,
&startq;Hear him! hear him! long life
to the iron-ca&s;ed orator.&endq; This cla|mour
&s;ub&s;iding, he pro&s;ecuted his ha|rangue
to the following effect:</P>
<P>&startq;Such a man as I have de&s;cribed
may be dangerous from ignorance,
but is neither &s;o mi&s;chievous nor &s;o
<PB N="196" REF="201">
dete&s;table as the wretch who know|ingly
betrays his tru&s;t, and &s;ues to be
the hireling and pro&s;titute of a weak
and worthle&s;s mini&s;ter; a &s;ordid
knave, without honour or principle,
who belongs to no family who&s;e ex|ample
can reproach him with degene|racy;
who has no country to com|mand
his re&s;pect, no friends to en|gage
his affection, no religion to re|gulate
his morals, no con&s;cience to
re&s;train his iniquity, and who wor&s;hips
no God but mammon. An in&s;inuat|ing
mi&s;creant, who undertakes for the
dirtie&s;t work of the vile&s;t admini&s;tra|tion;
who practi&s;es national u&s;ury,
receiving by whole&s;ale the rewards
venality, and di&s;tributing the wages
of corruption by retail.&endq;</P>
<P>In this place our adventurer's &s;peech
was drowned in the acclamations of
of the fox-hunters, who now trium|phed
in their turn, and hoick&s;ed the
&s;peaker, exclaiming, &startq;Well opened
Jowler&mdash;to 'un, to 'un, to 'un again,
Sweetlips! hey, Merry, Whitefoot!&endq;

After a &s;hort interruption, he thus re|&s;umed
his di&s;cour&s;e:</P>
<P>&startq;When &s;uch a caitif pre&s;ents him|&s;elf
to you, like the devil, with a
temptation in his hand, avoid him
as if he were in fact the devil&mdash;it is not
the offering of di&s;intere&s;ted love; for
what &s;hould induce him, who has no
affections, to love you, to who&s;e per|&s;ons
he is an utter &s;tranger? alas! it
is not a benevolence, but a bribe. He
wants to buy you at one market, that
he may &s;ell you at another. With|out
doubt his intention is to make an
advantage of his purcha&s;e; and this
aim he cannot accompli&s;h, but by &s;a|crificing,
in &s;ome &s;ort, your intere&s;t,
your independency, to the wicked de|&s;igns
of a mini&s;ter, as he can expect
no gratification for the faithful di&s;|charge
of his duty. But, even if he
&s;hould not find an opportunity of &s;ell|ing
you to advantage, the crime, the
&s;hame, the infamy, will &s;till be the
&s;ame in you, who, ba&s;er than the
mo&s;t abandoned pro&s;titutes, have &s;old
your&s;elves and your po&s;terity for hire

&mdash;for a paultry price, to be refunded
with intere&s;t by &s;ome mini&s;ter, who
will indemnify him&s;elf cut of your

bought and &s;old with your own mo|ney&mdash;
the mi&s;erable pittance you may
now receive, is no more than a pitcher
full of water thrown in to moi&s;ten the
&s;ucker of that pump which will drain
you to the bottom. Let me there|fore
advi&s;e and exhort you, my coun|trymen,
to avoid the oppo&s;ite extremes
of the ignorant clown and the de&s;ign|ing
courtier, and choo&s;e a man of ho|ne&s;ty,

<P>The doctrine of moderation was a
very unpopular &s;ubject in &s;uch an a&s;|&s;embly;
and, accordingly, they re|jected
it as one man. They began
to think the &s;tranger wanted to &s;et up
for him&s;elf, a &s;uppo&s;ition that could
not fail to incen&s;e both &s;ides equally,
as they were both zealou&s;ly engaged
in their re&s;pective cau&s;es. The Whigs
and the Tories joined again&s;t this in|truder,
who being neither, was treated
<PB N="199" REF="204">
like a mon&s;ter, or chimaera in politics.
They hi&s;&s;ed, they hooted, and they
hollowed; they annoyed him with
mi&s;&s;iles of dirt, &s;ticks, and &s;tones;
they cur&s;ed, they threatened, and re|viled,
till at length his patience was
exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>Ungrateful and abandoned mi&s;|creants!

men and chri&s;tians, as free-born Bri|tons

you are a pack of venal, infa|mous
&s;coundrels, and I will treat you
accordingly.&endq; So &s;aying, he brandi&s;h|ed
his lance, and riding into the thick|e&s;t
of the concour&s;e, laid about him
with &s;uch dexterity and effect, that
the multitude was immediately di&s;|per&s;ed,
and he retired without further
mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>The &s;ame good fortune did not at|tend
&s;quire Crab&s;haw in his retreat.
The ludicrous &s;ingularity of his fea|tures,
and the half-mown crop of hair

invited &s;ome wags to make
merry at his expence: one of them

<P>SIR Launcelot, boiling with in|dignation
at the venality and fac|tion

harangued to &s;o little purpo&s;e, retired
with the mo&s;t deliberate di&s;dain to|wards
one of the gates of the town,
on the out&s;ide of which his curio&s;ity

Ferret, mounted upon a &s;tool, with a
<PB N="201" REF="206">
kind of &s;atchel hanging round his
neck, and a vial di&s;played in his right
hand, while he held forth to the au|dience
in a very vehement &s;train of
elocution.</P>
<P>Crab&s;haw thought him&s;elf happi|ly
delivered, when he reached the
&s;uburbs, and proceeded without halt|ing;
but his ma&s;ter mingled with the
crowd, and heard the orator expre&s;s
him&s;elf to this effect: &startq;Very likely,
you may undervalue me and my me|dicine,
becau&s;e I don't appear upon a
&s;tage of rotten boards, in a &s;habby
velvet coat and tye-periwig, with a
fooli&s;h fellow in motley, to make
you laugh by making wry faces: but
I &s;corn to u&s;e the&s;e dirty arts for en|gaging
your attention. The&s;e paul|try
tricks, <HI>ad captandum vulgus,</HI> can
have no effect but on ideots, and if
you are ideots, I don't de&s;ire you
&s;hould be my cu&s;tomers. Take no|tice,
I don't addre&s;s you in the &s;tile of
a mountebank, or a high German
doctor; and yet the kingdom is full
of mountebanks, empirics, and quacks.
<PB N="202" REF="207">
We have quacks in religion, quacks
in phy&s;ic, quacks in law, quacks in
politics, quacks in patrioti&s;m, quacks
in government; high German quacks
that have bli&s;tered, &s;weated, bled, and
purged the nation into an atrophy.
But this is not all: they have not only
evacuated her into a con&s;umption, but
they have intoxicated her brain, until
&s;he is become delirious: &s;he can no
longer pur&s;ue her own intere&s;t; or,
indeed, rightly di&s;tingui&s;h it: like the
people of Nineveh, &s;he can hardly
tell her right hand from her left; but,
as a changeling, is dazzled and de|lighted
by an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> a Will o'
the Wi&s;p, an exhalation from the vile&s;t
materials in nature, that leads her
a&s;tray through We&s;tphalian bogs and
de&s;erts, and will one day break her
neck over &s;ome barren rocks, or leave
her &s;ticking in &s;ome H&mdash;n pit or quag|mire.
For my part, if you have a
mind to betray your country, I have
no objection. In &s;elling your&s;elves
and your fellow-citizens, you only
di&s;po&s;e of a pack of ra&s;cals who de|&s;erve
<PB N="203" REF="208">

why &s;hould not I &s;ell this here
Elixir of Long Life, which if properly
u&s;ed, will protract your days till you
&s;hall have &s;een your country ruined?
I &s;hall not pretend to di&s;turb your un|der&s;tandings,
which are none of the
&s;tronge&s;t, with a hotch-potch of un|intelligible
terms, &s;uch as Ari&s;totle's
four principles of generation, unform|ed
matter, privation, efficient and fi|nal
cau&s;es. Ari&s;totle was a pedantic
blockhead, and &s;till more knave than
fool. The &s;ame cen&s;ure we may &s;afe|ly
put on that wi&s;e-acre Dio&s;corides,
with his faculties of &s;imples, his &s;e|minal,
&s;pecific, and principal virtues;
and that crazy commentator Galen,
with his four elements, elementary
qualities, his eight complexions, his
harmonies, and di&s;cords. Nor &s;hall
I expatiate on the alkahe&s;t of that
mad &s;coundrel Paracel&s;us, with which
he pretended to reduce flints into &s;alt;
nor the <HI>archaeus</HI> or <HI>&s;piritus rector</HI> of
that vi&s;ionary Van Helmont, his &s;imple,
<PB N="204" REF="209">
elementary water, his <HI>gas,</HI> ferments,
and tran&s;mutations; nor &s;hall I en|large
upon the &s;alt, &s;ulphur, and oil,
the <HI>acidum vagum,</HI> the mercury of me|tals,
and the volatilized vitriol of other
modern chymi&s;ts, a pack of ignorant,
conceited, knavi&s;h ra&s;cals, that puzzle
your weak heads with &s;uch jargon,
ju&s;t as a Germanized m&mdash;r throws
du&s;t in your eyes, by lugging in and
ringing the changes on the balance of
power, the prote&s;tant religion, and your
allies on the continent; acting like the
juggler, who picks your pockets while
he dazzles your eyes and amu&s;es your
fancy with twirling his fingers, and
reciting the gibberi&s;h of <HI>hocus pocus;</HI>
for, in fact, the balance of power is
a mere chimera; as for the prote&s;tant
rellgion, nobody gives him&s;elf any
trouble about it; and allies on the
continent we have none; or at lea&s;t,
none that would rai&s;e an hundred men
to &s;ave us from perdition, unle&s;s we
paid an extravagant price for their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But, to return to this here
<PB N="205" REF="210">
Elixir of Long Life, I might embel|li&s;h
it with a great many high-&s;ound|ing
epithets; but I di&s;dain to follow
the example of every illiterate vaga|bond,
that from idlene&s;s turns quack,
and adverti&s;es his no&s;trum in the pub|lic
papers. I am neither a felonious
dry-&s;alter returned from exile, an
ho&s;pital &s;tump-turner, a decayed &s;tay|maker,
a bankrupt-printer, or in&s;ol|vent
debtor, relea&s;ed by act of parlia|ment.
I did not pretend to admini|&s;ter
medicines, without the lea&s;t tinc|ture
of letters, or &s;uborn wretches to
perjure them&s;elves in fal&s;e affidavits of
cures that were never performed; nor
employ a &s;et of led-captains to ha|rangue
in my prai&s;e, at all public pla|ces.
I was bred regularly to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of chymi&s;try, and have tried all
the proce&s;&s;es of alchemy, and I may
venture to &s;ay, that this here Elixir
is, in fact, the <HI>chru&s;eon pepuromenon ek
puros,</HI> the vi&s;ible, glorious, &s;piritual
body, from whence all other beings
derive their exi&s;tence, as proceeding
from their father the &s;un, and their
<PB N="206" REF="211">
mother the moon; from the &s;un, as
from a living and &s;piritual gold, which
is mere fire; con&s;equently, the com|mon
and univer&s;al fir&s;t created mover,
from whence all moveable things have
their di&s;tinct and particular motions;
and al&s;o from the moon, as from the
wife of the &s;un, and the common
mother of all &s;ublunary things: and
for as much as man is, and mu&s;t be
the comprehen&s;ive end of all crea|tures,
and the microco&s;m, he is coun|&s;elled
in the Revelations to buy gold
that is thoroughly fired, or rather pure
fire, that he may become rich and
like the &s;un; as, on the contrary, he
becomes poor, when he abu&s;es the
ar&s;enical poi&s;on; &s;o that his &s;ilver, by
the fire, mu&s;t be calcined to a <HI>caput
mortuum,</HI> which happens, when he
will hold and retain the men&s;truum
out of which he partly exi&s;ts, for his
own property, and doth not daily of|fer
up the &s;ame in the fire of the &s;un,
that the woman may be cloathed with
the &s;un, and become a &s;un, and there|by
rule over the moon; that is to &s;ay,
<PB N="207" REF="212">
that he may get the moon under his
feet.&mdash;Now this here Elixir, &s;old for
no more than &s;ix-pence a vial, con|tains
the e&s;&s;ence of the alkahe&s;t, the
archaeus, the catholicon, the men|&s;truum,
the &s;un, moon, and to &s;um
up all in one word, is the true, ge|nuine,
unadulterated, unchangeable,
immaculate and &s;pecific <HI>chru&s;eon pepu|romenon

<P>The audience were variou&s;ly affect|ed
by this learned oration: &s;ome of
tho&s;e who favoured the preten&s;ions of
the whig candidate, were of opinion
that he ought to be puni&s;hed for his
pre&s;umption in reflecting &s;o &s;curri|lou&s;ly
on mini&s;ters and mea&s;ures. Of
this &s;entiment was our adventurer,
though he could not help admiring
the courage of the orator, and own|ing
within him&s;elf, that he had mixed
&s;ome melancholy truths with his &s;cur|rility.
Mr. Ferret would not have
&s;tood &s;o long in his ro&s;trum unmo|le&s;ted,
had not he cunningly cho&s;en
his &s;tation immediately without the
juri&s;diction of the town, who&s;e ma|gi&s;trates
<PB N="208" REF="213">
therefore could not take cog|nizance
of his conduct; but appli|cation
was made to the con&s;table of
the other pari&s;h, while our no&s;trum|monger
proceeded in his &s;peech, the
conclu&s;ion of which produced &s;uch
an effect upon his hearers, that his
whole cargo was immediately ex|hau&s;ted.
He had ju&s;t &s;tepped down
from his &s;tool, when the con&s;table,
with his &s;taff, arrived, and took him
under his guidance. Mr. Ferret, on
this occa&s;ion, attempted to intere&s;t the
people in his behalf, by exhorting them
to vindicate the liberty of the &s;ubject,
again&s;t &s;uch an act of oppre&s;&s;ion; but
finding them deaf to the tropes and
figures of his elocution, he addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to our knight, reminding him
of his duty to protect the helple&s;s and
the injured, and earne&s;tly &s;oliciting his
interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, without making the
lea&s;t reply to his entreaties, re&s;olved to
&s;ee the end of this adventure; and be|ing
joined by his &s;quire, followed the
pri&s;oner at a di&s;tance, mea&s;uring back
<PB N="209" REF="214">
the ground he had travelled the day
before, until he reached another &s;mall
borough, where Ferret was hou&s;ed in
the common pri&s;on. While he &s;at a|hor&s;eback,
deliberating on the next
&s;tep he &s;hould take, he was acco&s;ted
by the voice of Tom Clarke, who
called in a whimpering tone, through
a window grated with iron, &startq;For
the love of God! Sir Launcelot, do,
dear Sir, be &s;o good as to take the
trouble to alight and come up &s;tairs
&mdash;I have &s;omething to communicate
of con&s;equence to the community in
general, and you in particular&mdash;Pray,
do, dear Sir Knight. I beg a boon
in the name of St. Michael and St.
George for England.&endq;</P>
<P>Our adventurer, not a little &s;ur|prized
at this addre&s;s, di&s;mounted
without he&s;itation, and being admit|ted
to the common jail, there found
not only his old friend Tom, but al&s;o
the uncle, &s;itting on a bench with a
woollen night-cap on his head, and a
pair of &s;pectacles on his no&s;e, reading
very earne&s;tly in a book, which he
<PB N="210" REF="215">
afterwards under&s;tood was intituled,
&startq;The Life and Adventures of Va|lentine

&s;ooner &s;aw his great pattern enter,
than he ro&s;e and received him with
the &s;alutation of &startq;What cheer, bro|ther?&endq;
and before the knight could
an&s;wer, added the&s;e words: &startq;You
&s;ee how the land lies&mdash;here have Tom
and I been fa&s;t a-&s;hore the&s;e four and
twenty hours; and this berth we have
got by attempting to tow your galley,
brother, from the enemy's harbour.&mdash;Adds
bobs! if we had this here fel|low
whore&s;on for a con&s;ort, with all
our tackle in order, brother, we'd &s;oon
&s;hew'em the top&s;ail, &s;lip our cable,
and down with their barricadoes. But,
how&s;omever, it don't &s;ignify talking,
&mdash;patience is a good &s;tream-anchor,
and will hold, as the &s;aying is,
&mdash;but, damn my&mdash;as for the matter
of my bolt&s;prit.&mdash;&mdash;Hearkye, heark|ye,

with three at a time, one upon my
bow, one upon my quarter, and one
right a-head, rubbing, and drubbing,
<PB N="211" REF="216">
lying athwart haw&s;e, raking fore and
aft, battering and grappling, and la&s;h|ing

cra&s;h went the bolt&s;prit&mdash;down came
the round-top&mdash;up with the dead lights
&mdash;I &s;aw nothing but the &s;tars at noon,
lo&s;t the helm of my &s;even &s;en&s;es, and
down I broached upon my broad&s;ide.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>As Mr. Clarke rightly conceived
that his uncle would need an interpre|ter,
he began to explain the&s;e hints
by giving a circum&s;tantial detail of his
own and the captain's di&s;a&s;ter. He
told Sir Launcelot, that notwith&s;tand|ing
all his per&s;ua&s;ion and remon&s;tran|ces,
captain Crowe in&s;i&s;ted upon ap|pearing
in the character of a knight-errant;
and with that view had &s;et
out from the public-hou&s;e on the
morning that &s;ucceeded his vigil in
the church: that upon the high-way
they had met with a coach, contain|ing
two ladies, one of whom &s;eem|ed
to be under great agitation; for,
as they pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;truggled with the
other, thru&s;t out her head at the
window, and &s;aid &s;omething which
<PB N="212" REF="217">
he could not di&s;tinctly hear; that cap|tain
Crowe was &s;truck with admiration
of her unequalled beauty; and he,
(Tom) no &s;ooner informed him who
&s;he was, than he re&s;olved to &s;et her
at liberty, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;he
was under re&s;traint and in di&s;tre&s;s: that
he accordingly un&s;heathed his cutla&s;s,
and riding back after the coach, com|manded
the driver to bring to, on pain
of death: that one of the &s;ervants
believing the captain to be an high|wayman,
pre&s;ented a blunderbu&s;s, and
in all probability would have &s;hot him
on the &s;pot, had not he (the nephew)
rode up and a&s;&s;ured them the gentle|man
was <HI>non compos:</HI> that notwith|&s;tanding
his intimation, all the three
attacked him with the butt ends of
their hor&s;e-whips, while the coach
drove on, and although he laid about
him with great fury, at la&s;t brought
him to the ground by a &s;troke on the
temple: that Mr. Clarke him&s;elf then
interpo&s;ed in defence of his kin&s;man,
and was al&s;o &s;everely beaten: that two
of the &s;ervants, upon application to
<PB N="213" REF="218">
a ju&s;tice of the peace, re&s;iding near
the field of battle, had granted a
warrant again&s;t the captain and his
nephew, and without examination,
committed them as idle vagrants, af|ter
having &s;eized their hor&s;es and their
money, on pretence of their being
&s;u&s;pected for highwaymen. &startq;But,
as there was no ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion,
(added he) I am of opinion, the ju|&s;tice
is guilty of a tre&s;pa&s;s, and may
be &s;ued for <HI>fal&s;um impri&s;onamentum,</HI>
and con&s;iderable damages obtained;
for you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, Sir,
no ju&s;tice has a right to commit any
per&s;on 'till after due examination; be|&s;ides,
we were not committed for an
a&s;&s;ault and battery, <HI>audit&acirc; querela,</HI> nor
as wandering lunatics by the &s;tatute,
who, to be &s;ure, may be apprehend|ed
by a ju&s;tice's warrant, and locked
up and chained, if nece&s;&s;ary, or to
be &s;ent to their la&s;t legal &s;ettlement:
but we were committed as vagrants
and &s;u&s;pected highwaymen. Now
we do not fall under the de&s;crip|tion
of vagrants; nor did any circum|&s;tance
<PB N="214" REF="219">
appear to &s;upport the &s;u&s;picion
of robbery; for to con&s;titute robbery,
there mu&s;t be &s;omething taken; but
here nothing was taken but blows,
and they were upon compul&s;ion: even
an attempt to rob, without any taking,
is not felony, but a mi&s;demeanor.
To be &s;ure there is a taking in deed,
and a taking in law: but &s;till the rob|ber
mu&s;t be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a thing
&s;tolen; and we attempted to &s;teal
our&s;elves away&mdash;&mdash;My uncle indeed
would have relea&s;ed the young lady
<HI>vi et armis,</HI> had his &s;trength been e|qual
to his inclination; and in &s;o do|ing,
I would have willingly lent my
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, both from a de&s;ire to &s;erve
&s;uch a beautiful young creature, and
al&s;o in regard to your honour, for I
thought I heard her call upon your
name.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Ha! how! what! who&s;e name?
&s;ay, &s;peak&mdash;heaven and earth!&endq; (cried
the Knight, with marks of the mo&s;t
violent emotion.) Clarke terrified at
his looks, replied, &startq;I beg your par|don
a thou&s;and times; I did not &s;ay
<PB N="215" REF="220">
po&s;itively &s;he did &s;peak tho&s;e words:
but I apprehended &s;he did &s;peak
them. Words, which may be taken
or interpreted by a law in general,
or common &s;en&s;e, ought not to re|ceive
a &s;trained, or unu&s;ual con&s;truc|tion;
and ambiguous words&endq;&mdash;&mdash;&startq;Speak,
or be dumb for ever! (ex|claimed
Sir Launcelot in a terrific
tone, laying, his hand on his &s;word)
what young lady, ha! What name
did &s;he call upon?&endq; Clarke falling on
his knees, an&s;wered, not without &s;tam|mering,
&startq;Mi&s;s Aurelia Darnel; to
the be&s;t of my recollection, &s;he cal|led
upon Sir Launcelot Greaves.&endq;
&startq;Sacred powers! (cried our adven|turer)
which way did the carriage pro|ceed?&endq;</P>
<P>When Tom told him that the coach
quitted the po&s;t-road, and &s;truck a|way
to the right at full &s;peed, Sir
Launcelot was &s;eized with a pen&s;ive
fit; his head &s;unk upon his brea&s;t,
and he mu&s;ed in &s;ilence for &s;everal
minutes, with the mo&s;t melancholy
expre&s;&s;ion on his countenance: then
<PB N="216" REF="221">
recollecting him&s;elf, he a&s;&s;umed a
more compo&s;ed and chearful air, and
a&s;ked &s;everal que&s;tions with re&s;pect
to the arms on the coach, and the li|veries
worn by the &s;ervants. It was
in the cour&s;e of this interrogation, that
he di&s;covered he had actually con|ver&s;ed
with one of the foot-men,
who had brought back Crab&s;haw's
hor&s;e: a circum&s;tance that filled him
with anxiety and chagrin, as he had
omitted to inquire the name of his
ma&s;ter, and the place to which the
coach was travelling; though, in all
probability, had he made the&s;e inqui|ries,
he would have received very
little &s;atisfaction, there being rea&s;on
to think the &s;ervants were enjoined
&s;ecrecy. The knight, in order to
meditate on this unexpected adven|ture,
&s;at down by his old friend, and
entered into a reverie, which la&s;ted
about a quarter of an hour, and might
have continued longer, had it not
been interrupted by the voice of Crab|&s;haw,
who bawled aloud, &startq;Look
to it, my ma&s;ters&mdash;as you brew you
<PB N="217" REF="222">
mu&s;t drink&mdash;this &s;hall be a dear day's
work to &s;ome of you, for my part I
&s;ay nothing&mdash;the braying a&s;s eats a
little gra&s;s&mdash;one barber &s;haves not &s;o
clo&s;e, but another finds a few &s;tub|ble&mdash;&mdash;you
wanted to catch a capon,
and you've &s;tole a cat. He that takes
up his lodgings in a &s;table, mu&s;t be
contented to lie upon litter.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The knight, de&s;irous of knowing
the cau&s;e that prompted Timothy to
apothegmatize in this manner, looked
through the grate, and perceived the
&s;quire fairly &s;et in the &s;tocks, &s;ur|rounded
by a mob of people. When
he called to him, and a&s;ked the rea|&s;on
of this di&s;graceful re&s;traint, Crab|&s;haw
replied, &startq;There's no cake, but
there's another of the &s;ame make&mdash;
who never climbed never fell&mdash;after
clouds comes clear weather. 'Tis all
long of your honour I've met with
this preferment; no de&s;ervings of my
own, but the intere&s;t of my ma&s;ter.
Sir knight, if you will flay the ju&s;tice,
hang the con&s;table, relea&s;e your &s;quire,
and burn the town, your name will
<PB N="218" REF="223">
be famous in &s;tory: but, if you are
content, I am thankful. Two hours
are &s;oon &s;pent in &s;uch good company;
in the mean time look to'un jailor,
there's a frog in the &s;tocks.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, incen&s;ed at this af|front
offered to his &s;ervant, advanced
to the pri&s;on-door, but found it fa&s;t
locked, and when he called to the
turnkey, he was given to under&s;tand
that he him&s;elf was pri&s;oner. En|raged
at this intimation, he demand|ed
at who&s;e &s;uit; and was an&s;wered
through the wicket, &startq;At the &s;uit of
the king, in who&s;e name I will hold
you fa&s;t, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&endq;</P>
<P>The knight's looks now began to
lighten, he rolled his eyes around,
and &s;natching up an oaken bench,
which three ordinary men could &s;carce
have lifted from the ground, he, in
all likelihood, would have &s;hattered
the door in pieces, had not he been
re&s;trained by the interpo&s;ition of Mr.
Clarke, who intreated him to have a
little patience, a&s;&s;uring him he would
&s;ugge&s;t a plan that would avenge him
<PB N="219" REF="224">
amply on the ju&s;tice, without any
breach of the peace. &startq;I &s;ay, the
ju&s;tice (added Tom) becau&s;e it mu&s;t
be his doing.&mdash;He is a little petulant
&s;ort of a fellow, ignorant of the law,
guilty of numberle&s;s irregularities;
and, if properly managed, may for
this here act of arbitrary power, be
not only ca&s;t in a &s;winging &s;um, but
even turned out of the commi&s;&s;ion
with di&s;grace.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>This was a very &s;ea&s;onable hint,
in con&s;equence of which the bench
was &s;oftly replaced, and captain Crowe
depo&s;ited the poker, with which he
had armed him&s;elf to &s;econd the ef|forts
of Sir Launcelot. They now,
for the fir&s;t time, perceived that Fer|ret
had di&s;appeared; and, upon in|quiry,
found that he was in fact the
occa&s;ion of the knight's detention and
the &s;quire's di&s;grace.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">De&s;cription of a modern Magi&s;trate.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore the knight would take any
re&s;olution for extricating him&s;elf
from his pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ment, he
de&s;ired to be better acquainted with the
character and circum&s;tances of the
ju&s;tice by whom he had been confined,
and likewi&s;e to under&s;tand the mean|ing
of his own detention. To be in|formed
in this la&s;t particular, he re|newed
his dialogue with the turnkey,
who told him, through the grate, that
Ferret no &s;ooner perceived him in the
jail, without his offen&s;ive arms, which
he had left below, than he de&s;ired to
be carried before the ju&s;tice, where
he had given information again&s;t the
knight, as a violator of the public
peace, who &s;trolled about the coun|try
with unlawful arms, rendering
the highways un&s;afe, encroaching up|on
the freedom of elections, putting
his maje&s;ty's liege &s;ubjects in fear of
their lives, and, in all probability,
<PB N="221" REF="226">
harbouring more dangerous de&s;igns
under an affected cloak of lunacy.
Ferret, upon this information, had
been relea&s;ed, and entertained as an
evidence for the king; and Crab|&s;haw
was put in the &s;tocks, as an idle
&s;troller.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, being &s;atisfied in
the&s;e particulars, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to
his fellow-pri&s;oners, and begged they
would communicate what they knew
re&s;pecting the worthy magi&s;trate, who
had been &s;o premature in the execu|tion
of his office. This reque&s;t was
no &s;ooner &s;ignified than a crew of
naked wretches crowded around him,
and, like a congregation of rooks,
opened their throats all at once, in
accu&s;ation of ju&s;tice Gobble. The
knight was moved at this &s;cene, which
he could not help comparing, in his
own mind, to what would appear
upon a much more awful occa&s;ion,
when the cries of the widow and the
orphan, the injured and oppre&s;&s;ed,
would be uttered at the tribunal of an
unerring Judge again&s;t the villainous
<PB N="222" REF="227">
and in&s;olent authors of their calami|ty.</P>
<P>When he had, with &s;ome difficul|ty,
quieted their clamours, and con|fined
his interrogation to one per&s;on
of a tolerably decent appearance, he
learned that ju&s;tice Gobble, who&s;e
father was a taylor, had for &s;ome
time &s;erved as a journeyman ho&s;ier in
London, where he had picked up
&s;ome law-terms, by conver&s;ing with
hackney-writers and attorneys clerks
of the lowe&s;t order; that, upon the
death of his ma&s;ter, he had in&s;inuat|ed
him&s;elf into the good graces of
the widow, who took him for her
hu&s;band, &s;o that he became a per&s;on
of &s;ome con&s;ideration, and &s;aved mo|ney
apace; that his pride, increa&s;ing
with his &s;ub&s;tance, was reinforced by
the vanity of his wife, who per&s;uaded
him to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s, that they
might live genteelly in the country;
that his father dying, and leaving a
couple of hou&s;es in this town, Mr.
Gobble had come down with his la|dy
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and liked the
<PB N="223" REF="228">
place &s;o well as to make a more con|&s;iderable
purcha&s;e in the neighbour|hood;
that a certain peer being in|debted
to him in the large way of his
bu&s;ine&s;s, and either unwilling or un|able
to pay the money, had com|pounded
the debt, by in&s;erting his
name in the commi&s;&s;ion; &s;ince which
period his own in&s;olence, and his
wife's o&s;tentation, had exceeded all
bounds: that, in the exertion of his
authority, he had committed a thou|&s;and
acts of cruelty and inju&s;tice
again&s;t the poorer &s;ort of people, who
were unable to call him to a proper
account: that his wife domineered
with a more ridiculous, though le&s;s
pernicious u&s;urpation, among the fe|males
of the place: that, in a word,
&s;he was the &s;ubject of continual mirth,
and he the object of univer&s;al dete&s;|tation.
Our adventurer, though ex|tremely
well di&s;po&s;ed to believe what
was &s;aid to the prejudice of Gobble,
would not give intire credit to this
de&s;cription, without fir&s;t inquir|ing
into the particulars of his con|duct.
<PB N="224" REF="229">
He therefore a&s;ked the &s;peak|er,
what was the cau&s;e of his par|ticular
complaint. &startq;For my own
part, Sir, (&s;aid he) I lived in repute,
and kept a &s;hop in this here town,
well furni&s;hed with a great variety of
articles. All the people in the place
were my cu&s;tomers; but what I and
many others chiefly depended upon,
was the extraordinary &s;ale at two an|nual
cu&s;tomary fairs, to which all
the country people in the neighbour|hood
re&s;orted to lay out their money.
I had employed all my &s;tock, and
even engaged my credit to procure a
large a&s;&s;ortment of goods for the
Lammas-market: but having given
my vote, in the election of a ve&s;try|clerk,
contrary to the intere&s;t of ju&s;tice
Gobble, he re&s;olved to work my
ruin. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the annual fairs,
by which a great many people, e&s;pe|cially
publicans, earned the be&s;t part
of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The country
people re&s;orted to another town. I
was over&s;tocked with a load of pe|ri&s;hable
commodities; and found my|&s;elf
<PB N="225" REF="230">
deprived of the be&s;t part of my
home cu&s;tomers by the ill-nature and
revenge of the ju&s;tice, who employ|ed
all his influence among the com|mon
people, making u&s;e of threats
and promi&s;es, to make them de&s;ert
my &s;hop, and give their cu&s;tom to
another per&s;on, whom he &s;ettled in
the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s under my no&s;e.
Being thus di&s;abled from making
punctual payments, my commodi|ties
&s;poiling, and my wife breaking
her heart, I grew negligent and care|le&s;s,
took to drinking, and my af|fairs
went to wreck. Being one day
in liquor, and provoked by the fleers
and taunts of the man who had &s;et
up again&s;t me, I &s;truck him at his
own door; upon which I was carried
before the ju&s;tice, who treated me
with &s;uch in&s;olence, that I became
de&s;perate, and not only abu&s;ed him
in the execution of his office, but al|&s;o
made an attempt to lay violent
hands upon his per&s;on. You know,
Sir, when a man is both drunk and
de&s;perate, he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="226" REF="231">
have any command of him&s;elf. I
was &s;ent hither to jail. My creditors
immediately &s;eized my effects; and,
as they were not &s;ufficient to di&s;charge
my debts, a &s;tatute of bankruptcy
was taken out again&s;t me: &s;o that
here I mu&s;t lie, until they think pro|per
to &s;ign my certificate, or the par|liament
&s;hall plea&s;e to pa&s;s an act for
the relief of in&s;olvent debtors.&endq;</P>
<P>The next per&s;on who pre&s;ented
him&s;elf in the croud of accu&s;ers was
a meagre figure, with a green apron,
who told the knight that he had kept
a public hou&s;e in town for a dozen
years, and enjoyed a good trade, which
was in a great mea&s;ure owing to a
&s;kittle-ground, in which the be&s;t peo|ple
of the place diverted them&s;elves
occa&s;ionally: that ju&s;tice Gobble, be|ing
di&s;obliged at his refu&s;ing to part
with a gelding which he had bred for
his own u&s;e, fir&s;t of all &s;hut up the
&s;kittle-ground; but finding the pub|lican
&s;till kept his hou&s;e open, he
took care that he &s;hould be deprived
of his licence, on pretence that the
<PB N="227" REF="232">
number of ale-hou&s;es was too great,
and that this man had been bred to
another employment. The poor pub|lican,
being thus deprived of his bread,
was obliged to try the &s;tay-making
bu&s;ine&s;s, to which he had &s;erved an
apprentice&s;hip: but being very ill|qualified
for this profe&s;&s;ion, he &s;oon
fell to decay, and contracted debts,
in con&s;equence of which he was now
in pri&s;on, where he had no other
&s;upport but what aro&s;e from the la|bour
of his wife, who had gone to
&s;ervice.</P>
<P>The next pri&s;oner who preferred
his complaint again&s;t the unrighte|ous
judge was a poacher, at who&s;e
practices ju&s;tice Gobble had for &s;ome
years connived, &s;o as even to &s;creen
him from puni&s;hment, in con&s;idera|tion
of being &s;upplied with game
gratis, till at length he was di&s;ap|pointed
by accident. His lady had
invited gue&s;ts to an entertainment,
and be&s;poke a hare, which the poa|cher
undertook to furni&s;h. He laid
his &s;nares accordingly over night; but
<PB N="228" REF="233">
they were di&s;covered, and taken away
by the game-keeper of the gentle|man
to whom the ground belonged.
All the excu&s;es the poacher could
make proved ineffectual in appea&s;ing
the re&s;entment of the ju&s;tice and his
wi&s;e, at being thus di&s;concerted. Mea|&s;ures
were taken to detect the delin|quent
in the exerci&s;e of his illicit occu|pation:
he was committed to &s;afe cu&s;to|dy;
and his wife, with five bantlings,
was pa&s;&s;ed to her hu&s;band's &s;ettlement
in a different part of the country.</P>
<P>A &s;tout &s;quat fellow, rattling with
chains, had ju&s;t taken up the ball of
accu&s;ation, when Sir Launcelot was
&s;tartled with the appearance of a wo|man,
who&s;e looks and equipage in|dicated
the mo&s;t piteous di&s;tre&s;s. She
&s;eemed to be turned of the middle
age, was of a lofty carriage, tall,
thin, weather-beaten, and wretched|ly
attired: her eyes were inflamed
with weeping, and her looks di&s;played
that wildne&s;s and peculiarity which
denote di&s;traction. Advancing to Sir
Launcelot, &s;he fell upon her knees,
<PB N="229" REF="234">
and cla&s;ping her hands together, utter|ed
the following rhap&s;ody in the mo&s;t
vehement tone of affliction:</P>
<P>&startq;Thrice potent, generous, and
augu&s;t emperor, here let my knees
cleave to the earth, until thou &s;halt
do me ju&s;tice on that inhuman cai|tiff
Gobble. Let him di&s;gorge my
&s;ub&s;tance which he hath devoured:
let him re&s;tore to my widowed arms
my child, my boy, the delight of my
eyes, the prop of my life, the &s;taff
of my &s;u&s;tenance, whom he hath
torn from my embrace, &s;tolen, be|trayed,
&s;ent into captivity, and mur|dered!&mdash;
Behold the&s;e bleeding wounds
upon his lovely brea&s;t! &s;ee how they
mangle his lifele&s;s coar&s;e! Horrour!
give me my child, barbarians! his
head &s;hall lie upon his Suky's bo&s;om
&mdash;&s;he will embalm him with her
tears.&mdash;Ha! plunge him in the deep!
&s;hall my boy then float in a watry
tomb!&mdash;Ju&s;tice, mo&s;t mighty em|peror!
ju&s;tice upon the villain who
hath ruined us all!&mdash;May heaven's
dreadful vengeance overtake him!
<PB N="230" REF="235">
may the keen &s;torm of adver&s;ity &s;trip
him of all his leaves and fruit! may
peace for&s;ake his mind, and re&s;t be
bani&s;hed from his pillow, &s;o that all
his days &s;hall be filled with reproach
and &s;orrow; and all his nights be
haunted with horrour and remor&s;e!
may he be &s;tung by jealou&s;y without
cau&s;e, and maddened by revenge
without the means of execution!
may all his offspring be blighted and
con&s;umed, like the mildewed ears of
corn, except one that &s;hall grow up
to cur&s;e his old age, and bring his
hoary head with &s;orrow to the grave,
as he him&s;elf has proved a cur&s;e to
me and mine!&endq;</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the pri&s;oners, perceiv|ing
the knight extremely &s;hocked
at her mi&s;ery and horrid imprecation,
removed her by force from his pre|&s;ence,
and conveyed her to another
room; while our adventurer under|went
a violent agitation, and could
not for &s;ome minutes compo&s;e him|&s;elf
&s;o well as to inquire into the na|ture
of this wretched creature's cala|mity.
<PB N="231" REF="236">
The &s;hopkeeper, of whom he
demanded this &s;atisfaction, gave him
to under&s;tand that &s;he was born a
gentlewoman, and had been well
educated: that &s;he married a curate,
who did not long &s;urvive his nuptials;
and afterwards became the wife of
one Oakley, a farmer, in opulent cir|cum&s;tances:
that, after twenty years
cohabitation with her hu&s;band, he
&s;u&s;tained &s;uch lo&s;&s;es by the di&s;temper
among the cattle, as he could not re|pair;
and that this rever&s;e of fortune
was &s;uppo&s;ed to have ha&s;tened his
death: that the widow, being a wo|man
of &s;pirit, determined to keep up
and manage the farm, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of an only &s;on, a very promi&s;ing
youth, who was already contracted in
marriage with the daughter of ano|ther
wealthy farmer. Thus the mo|ther
had a pro&s;pect of retrieving the
affairs of her family, when all her
hopes were da&s;hed and de&s;troyed by
a ridiculous pique which Mrs. Gob|ble
conceived again&s;t the young far|mer's
&s;weet-heart, Mrs. Su&s;an Sedge|moor.
<PB N="232" REF="237">
This young woman chancing
to be at a country a&s;&s;embly, where
the grave-digger of the pari&s;h acted
as ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, was cal|led
out to dance before Mi&s;s Gobble,
who happened to be there pre&s;ent al&s;o
with her mother. The circum&s;tance
was con&s;trued into an unpardonable
affront by the ju&s;tice's lady, who a|bu&s;ed
the director, in the mo&s;t op|probrious
terms, for his in&s;olence and
ill-manners; and, retiring in a &s;torm
of pa&s;&s;ion, vowed revenge again&s;t the
&s;aucy minx who had pre&s;umed to vie.
in gentility with Mi&s;s Gobble. The
ju&s;tice entered into her re&s;entment.
The grave-digger lo&s;t his place; and
Suky's lover, young Oakley, was
pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;oldier. Before his mo|ther
could take any &s;teps for his di&s;|charge,
he was hurried away to the
Ea&s;t-Indies, by the indu&s;try and con|trivance
of the ju&s;tice.&endq; Poor Suky
wept and pined until &s;he fell into a
con&s;umption. The forlorn widow,
being thus deprived of her &s;on, was
overwhelmed with grief to &s;uch a
<PB N="233" REF="238">
degree, that &s;he could no longer ma|nage
her concerns. Every thing
went backward: &s;he ran in arrears
with her landlord, and the pro&s;pect
of bankruptcy aggravated her afflic|tion,
while it added to her incapacity.
In the mid&s;t of the&s;e dia&s;trous circum|&s;tances,
news arrived that her &s;on
Greaves had lo&s;t his life in a &s;ea-en|gagement
with the enemy; and the&s;e
tidings almo&s;t in&s;tantly deprived her
of her rea&s;on. Then the landlord
&s;eized for his rent; and &s;he was ar|re&s;ted
at the &s;uit of ju&s;tice Gobble,
who had bought up one of her debts,
in order to di&s;tre&s;s her, and now pre|tended
that her madne&s;s was feigned.</P>
<P>When the name of Greaves was
mentioned our adventurer &s;tarted,
and changed colour; and, now the
&s;tory was ended, a&s;ked, with marks
of eager emotion, if the name of the
woman's fir&s;t hu&s;band was not Wil|ford.
When the pri&s;oner an&s;wered
in the affirmative, he ro&s;e up, and
&s;triking his brea&s;t, &startq;Good heaven!
(cried he) the very woman who watch|ed
<PB N="234" REF="239">
over my infancy, and even nou|ri&s;hed
me with her milk!&mdash;She was
my mother's humble friend.&mdash;Alas!
poor Dorothy! how would your old
mi&s;tre&s;s grieve to &s;ee her favourite in
this mi&s;erable condition!&endq; While he
pronounced the&s;e words, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment
of the hearers, a tear &s;tole
&s;oftly down each cheek. Then he
de&s;ired to know if the poor lunatic
had any intervals of rea&s;on; and was
given to under&s;tand, that &s;he was al|ways
quiet, and generally &s;uppo&s;ed
to have the u&s;e of her &s;en&s;es, except
when &s;he was di&s;turbed by &s;ome ex|traordinary
noi&s;e, or when any per|&s;on
touched upon her misfortune, or
mentioned the name of her oppre&s;&s;or,
in all which ca&s;es &s;he &s;tarted out into
extravagance and frenzy. They like|wi&s;e
imputed great part of the di&s;or|der
to the want of quiet, proper food,
and nece&s;&s;aries, with which &s;he was
but poorly &s;upplied by the cold hand
of chance charity. Our adventurer
was exceedingly affected by the di|&s;tre&s;s
of this woman, whom he re|&s;olved
<PB N="235" REF="240">
to relieve; and in proportion
as his commi&s;eration was excited, his
re&s;entment ro&s;e again&s;t the mi&s;creant,
who &s;eemed to have infinuated him|&s;elf
into the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace
on purpo&s;e to harra&s;s and oppre&s;s his
fellow-creatures. Thus animated, he
entered into con&s;ultation with Mr.
Thomas Clarke concerning the &s;teps
he &s;hould take, fir&s;t for their deliver|ance,
and then for pro&s;ecuting and
puni&s;hing the ju&s;tice. In re&s;ult of
this conference, the knight called
aloud for the jaylor, and demanded to
&s;ee a copy of his commitment, that
he might know the cau&s;e of his im|pri&s;onment,
and offer bail; or, in
ca&s;e that &s;hould be refu&s;ed, move for
a writ of Habeas Corpus. The jay|lor
told him the copy of the writ
&s;hould be forthcoming; but after he
had waited &s;ome time, and repeated
the demand before witne&s;&s;es, it was
not yet produced. Mr. Clarke then,
in a &s;olemn tone, gave the jaylor to
under&s;tand, that an officer, refu&s;ing
to deliver a true copy of the commit|ment
<PB N="236" REF="241">
warrant, was liable to the for|feiture
of one hundred pounds for
the fir&s;t offence; and for the &s;econd
to a forfeiture of twice that &s;um,
be&s;ides being di&s;abled from executing
his office.</P>
<P>Indeed, it was no ea&s;y matter to
comply with Sir Launcelot's demand;
for no warrant had been granted, nor
was it now in the power of the ju&s;tice
to remedy this defect, as Mr. Ferret had
taken him&s;elf away privately, with|out
having communicated the name
and de&s;ignation of the pri&s;oner. A
circum&s;tance the more mortifying to
the jaylor, as he perceived the extra|ordinary
re&s;pect which Mr. Clarke
and the captain payed to the knight,
and was now fully convinced that he
would be dealt with according to law.
Di&s;ordered with the&s;e reflections, he
imparted them to the ju&s;tice, who
had in vain cau&s;ed &s;earch to be made
for Ferret, and was now extremely
well inclined to &s;et the knight and his
friends at liberty, though he did not
at all &s;u&s;pect the quality and impor|tance
<PB N="237" REF="242">
of our adventurer. He could
not, however, re&s;i&s;t the temptation
of di&s;playing the authority of his
office; and therefore ordered the pri|&s;oners
to be brought before his tribu|nal,
that, in the capacity of a magi|&s;trate,
he might give them a &s;evere
reproof, and proper caution, with re|gard
to their future behaviour.</P>
<P>They were accordingly led thro' the
&s;treet in proce&s;&s;ion, guarded by the
con&s;table and his gang, followed by
Crab&s;haw, who had by this time been
relea&s;ed from the &s;tocks, and &s;ur|rounded
by a crowd of people, at|tracted
by curio&s;ity. When they ar|rived
at the ju&s;tice's hou&s;e, they were
detained for &s;ome time in the pa&s;&s;age:
then a voice was heard, commanding
the con&s;table to bring in the pri&s;oners,
and they were introduced to the hall
of audience, where Mr. Gobble &s;at in
judgment, with a crim&s;on velvet
night-cap on his head; and on his
right hand appeared his lady, puffed
up with the pride and in&s;olence of her
hu&s;band's office, fat, frowzy, and not
<PB N="238" REF="243">
over-clean, well &s;tricken in years,
without the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of an agree|able
feature, having a rubicond no&s;e,
ferret eyes, and imperious a&s;pect. The
ju&s;tice him&s;elf was a little, affected,
pert prig, who endeavoured to &s;olem|nize
his countenance by a&s;&s;uming an
air of con&s;equence, in which pride,
impudence, and folly were &s;trangely
blended. He a&s;pired at nothing &s;o
much as the character of an able
&s;poke&s;man; and took all opportunities
of holding forth at ve&s;try and quarter|&s;e&s;&s;ions,
as well as in the admini&s;tra|tion
of his office in private. He would
not, therefore, let &s;lip this occa&s;ion of
exciting the admiration of his hearers,
and, in an authoritative tone, thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed
our adventurer:</P>
<P>&startq;The laws of this land has pro|vided&mdash;I
&s;ays, as how provi&s;ion is
made by the laws of this here land,
in reverence to delinquems and mane|factors,
whereby the king's peace is
upholden by we magi&s;trates, who re|pre&s;ents
his maje&s;ty's per&s;on, better
than in e'er a contagious nation under
<PB N="239" REF="244">
the &s;un: but, how&s;oemever, that there
king's peace, and this here magi&s;trate's
authority, cannot be adequably and
identically upheld, if &s;o be as how
criminals e&s;capes unpuni&s;hed. Now,
friend, you mu&s;t be confidentious in
your own mind, as you are a noto|rious
criminal, who have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed a|gain
the laws on divers occa&s;ions and
importunities; if I had a mind to ex|erci&s;e
the rigour of the law, according
to the authority wherewith I am we&s;|ted,
you and your companions in ini|quity
would be &s;ewerely puni&s;hed by
the &s;tatue: but we magi&s;trates has a
power to litigate the &s;ewerity of ju&s;|tice,
and &s;o I am contented that you
&s;houlds be mercifully delt withal, and
even di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>To this harangue the knight re|plied,
with &s;olemn and deliberate ac|cent,
&startq;If I under&s;tand your meaning
aright, I am accu&s;ed of being a notori|ous
criminal; but neverthele&s;s you are
contented to let me e&s;cape with im|punity.
If I am a notorious criminal,
it is the duty of you, as a magi&s;trate,
<PB N="240" REF="245">
to bring me to condign puni&s;hment;
and if you allow a criminal to e&s;cape
unpuni&s;hed, you are not only unwor|thy
of a place in the commi&s;&s;ion, but
become acce&s;&s;ary to his guilt, and, to
all intents and purpo&s;es, <HI>&s;ocius criminis.</HI>
With re&s;pect to your proffered mercy,
I &s;hall decline the favour; nor do I
de&s;erve any indulgence at your hands:
for, depend upon it, I &s;hall &s;hew no
mercy to you, in the &s;teps I intend to
take for bringing you to ju&s;tice. I un|der&s;tand
that you have been long hack|neyed
in the ways of oppre&s;&s;ion, and
I have &s;een &s;ome living monuments of
your inhumanity&mdash;of that hereafter.
I my&s;elf have been detained in pri&s;on,
without cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned. I have been
treated with indignity, and in&s;ulted
by jaylors and con&s;tables, led thro'
the &s;treets like a felon, as a &s;pectacle
to the multitude, obliged to dance
attendance in your pa&s;&s;age, and after|wards
branded with the name of no|torious
criminal.&mdash;I now demand to
&s;ee the information in con&s;equence of
which I was detained in pri&s;on, the
<PB N="241" REF="246">
copy of the warrant of commitment
or detainer, and the face of the per|&s;on
by whom I was accu&s;ed. I in&s;i&s;t
upon a compliance with the&s;e de|mands,
as the privileges of a Briti&s;h
&s;ubject; and if it is refu&s;ed, I &s;hall
&s;eek redre&s;s before a higher tribunal.&endq;</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice &s;eemed to be not a lit|tle
di&s;turbed at this peremptory de|claration;
which, however, had no
other effect upon his wife, but that of
enraging her choler, and inflaming her
countenance. &startq;Sirrah! &s;irrah! (cried
&s;he) do you dares to in&s;ult a wor&s;hip|ful
magi&s;trate on the bench?&mdash;Can
you deny that you are a vagram, and
a dilatory &s;ort of a per&s;on? Han't the
man with the &s;atchel made an affidavy
of it?&mdash;If I was my hu&s;band, I'd
lay you fa&s;t by the heels for your re|&s;umption,
and ferk you with a primi|neery
into the bargain, unle&s;s you
could give a better account of your|&s;elf&mdash;I
would.&endq;</P>
<P>Gobble, encouraged by this fillip,
re&s;umed his petulance, and proceed|ed
in this manner:&mdash;&mdash;&startq;Heark ye,
friend, I might, as Mrs. Gobble very
<PB N="242" REF="247">
ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, trounce you for your
audacious behaviour; but I &s;corn to
take &s;uch advantages: how&s;omever,
I &s;hall make you give an account of
your&s;elf and your companions; for I
believes as how you are in a gang, and
all in a &s;tory, and perhaps you may
be found one day in a cord.&mdash;What
are you, friend? What is your &s;tation
and degree?&endq; &startq;I am a gentleman,&endq;
replied the knight. &startq;Ay, that is
Engli&s;h for a &s;orry fellow, (&s;aid the
ju&s;tice.) Every idle vagabond, who
has neither home nor habitation, trade
nor profe&s;&s;ion, de&s;igns him&s;elf a gen|tleman.
But I mu&s;t know how you
live?&endq; &startq;Upon my means.&endq; &startq;What
are your means?&endq;&mdash;&startq;My e&s;tate.&endq;&mdash;
&startq;Whence doth it ari&s;e?&endq; &startq;From
inheritance.&endq; &startq;Your e&s;tate lies in
bra&s;s, and that you have inherited
from nature: but do you inherit lands
and tenements?&endq; &startq;Yes.&endq; &startq;But they
are neither here nor there, I doubt.&mdash;
Come, come, friend, I &s;hall bring
you about pre&s;ently.&endq; Here the exami|nation
was interrupted by the arrival of
Mr. Fillet the &s;urgeon, who chancing to
<PB N="243" REF="248">
pa&s;s, and &s;eeing a croud about the
door, went in to &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which &s;hews there are more ways to kill

<P>MR. Fillet no &s;ooner appeared in
the judgment-chamber of ju&s;tice
Gobble than captain Crowe, &s;eizing
him by the hand, exclaimed, &startq;Body
o'me! Doctor, thou'rt come up in
the nick of time to lend us a hand in
putting about.&mdash;We're a little in the
&s;tays here&mdash;but how&s;omever we've got
a good pilot, who knows the coa&s;t,
and can weather the point, as the &s;ay|ing
is. As for the enemy's ve&s;&s;el, &s;he
has had a &s;hot or two already a-thwart
her fore-foot: the next, I do &s;uppo&s;e,
will &s;trike the hull, and then you'll
&s;ee her taken all a-back.&endq; The doc|tor,
who perfectly under&s;tood his dia|lect,
a&s;&s;ured him he might depend
upon his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and advancing to
the knight, acco&s;ted him in the&s;e
words: &startq;Sir Launcelot Greaves, your
mo&s;t humble &s;ervant.&mdash;When I &s;aw
<PB N="244" REF="249">
a croud at the door, I little thought
of finding you within, treated with
&s;uch indignity.&mdash;Yet I can't help be|ing
plea&s;ed with an opportunity of
proving the e&s;teem and veneration I
have for your per&s;on and character:
&mdash;you will do me a particular plea&s;ure
in commanding my be&s;t &s;ervices.&endq;</P>
<P>Our adventurer thanked him for this
in&s;tance of his friend&s;hip, which he told
him he would u&s;e without he&s;itation;
and de&s;ired he would procure imme|diate
bail for him and his two friends,
who had been impri&s;oned, contrary to
law, without any cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned. Du|ring
this &s;hort dialogue, the ju&s;tice,
who had heard of Sir Launcelot's fa|mily
and fortune, though an utter
&s;tranger to his per&s;on, was &s;eized with
&s;uch pangs of terror and compunction,
as a grovelling mind may be &s;uppo&s;ed
to have felt in &s;uch circum&s;tances; and
they &s;eemed to produce the &s;ame un|&s;avoury
effects that are &s;o humorou&s;ly
delineated by the inimitable Hogarth
in the print of Felix on his tribunal,
done in the Dutch &s;tile. Neverthele&s;s,
&s;eeing Fillet retire to execute the
<PB N="245" REF="250">
knight's commands, he recollected
him&s;elf &s;o far as to tell the pri&s;oners
there was no occa&s;ion to give them|&s;elves
any further trouble; for he
would relea&s;e them without bail or
mainprize. Then di&s;carding all the
in&s;olence from his features, and a&s;|&s;uming
an a&s;pect of the mo&s;t hum|ble
adulation, he begged the knight
ten thou&s;and pardons for the freedoms
he had taken, which were intirely
owing to his ignorance of Sir Launce|lot's
quality. &startq;Yes, I'll a&s;&s;ure you,
Sir, (&s;aid the wife), my hu&s;band would
have bit off his tongue, rather than &s;ay
black is the white of your eye, if &s;o be
he had known your capacity.&mdash;Thank
God, we have been u&s;ed to deal with
gentlefolks, and many's the good
pound we have lo&s;t by them; but
what of that? Sure we know how to
behave to our betters. Mr. Gobble,
thanks be to God, can de&s;y the whole
world to prove that he ever &s;aid an
uncivil word, or did a rude thing to a
gentleman, knowing him to be a per|&s;on
of fortune, Indeed, as to your
poor gentry and riff-raff, your tag,
<PB N="246" REF="251">
rag, and bobtail, or &s;uch vulgar &s;coun|drelly
people, he has always behaved
like a magi&s;trate, and treated them
with the rigger of authority.&endq; &startq;In
other words (&s;aid the knight), he has
tyrannized over the poor, and connived
at the vices of the rich: your hu&s;band
is little obliged to you for this con|fe&s;&s;ion,
woman.&endq; &startq;Woman! (cried
Mrs. Gobble, impurpled with wrath,
and fixing her hands on her &s;ides by
way of defiance) I &s;corn your words.
&mdash;Marry come up, woman! quotha:
no more a woman than your wor&s;hip.&endq;
Then bur&s;ting into tears, &startq;Hu&s;band
(continued &s;he), if you had the &s;oul
of a lou&s;e, you would not &s;uffer me
to be abu&s;ed at this rate: you would
not &s;it &s;till on the bench, and hear
your &s;pou&s;e called &s;uch contemptible
epitaphs.&mdash;Who cares for his title and
his knight&s;hip? You and I hu&s;band,
knew a taylor that was made a knight:
but, thank God, I have noblemen to
&s;tand by me, with their privileges and
beroguetifs.&endq;</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant Mr. Fillet returned
with his friend, a practitioner in the
<PB N="247" REF="252">
law, who freely offered to join in bail|ing
our adventurer, and the other two
pri&s;oners, for any &s;um that &s;hould be
required. The ju&s;tice, perceiving the
affair began to grow more and more
&s;erious, declared that he would di&s;|charge
the warrants and di&s;mi&s;s the
pri&s;oners. Here Mr. Clarke inter|po&s;ing,
ob&s;erved, that again&s;t the
knight no warrant had been granted,
nor any information &s;worn to; con|&s;equently,
as the ju&s;tice had not com|plied
with the form of proceeding di|rected
by &s;tatute, the impri&s;onment
was <HI>coram non judice,</HI> void. &startq;Right,
Sir (&s;aid the other lawyer), if a ju&s;|tice
commits a felon for trial, with|out
binding over the pro&s;ecutor to the
a&s;&s;izes, he &s;hall be fined.&endq;&mdash;&mdash;&startq;And
again (cried Clarke), if a ju&s;tice i&s;&s;ues
a warrant for commitment, where
there is no accu&s;ation, action will lie
again&s;t the ju&s;tice.&endq; &startq;Moreover (re|plied
the &s;tranger), if a ju&s;tice of peace
is guilty of any mi&s;demeanour in his
office, information lies again&s;t him in
<HI>Banco Regis,</HI> where he &s;hall be pu|ni&s;hed
by fine and impri&s;onment.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="253">
&startq;And be&s;ides, (re&s;umed the accurate
Tom), the &s;ame court will grant an
information again&s;t a ju&s;tice of peace,
on motion, for &s;ending even a &s;ervant
to the hou&s;e of correction, or common
jail, without &s;ufficient cau&s;e.&endq; &startq;True!
(exclaimed the other limb of the law)
and, for contempt of law, attachment
may be had again&s;t ju&s;tices of peace in
<HI>Banco Regis.</HI> A ju&s;tice of the peace
was fined a thou&s;and marks for cor|rupt
practices.&endq; With the&s;e words
advancing to Mr. Clarke, he &s;hook
him by the hand, with the appellation
of Brother, &s;aying, &startq;I doubt the
ju&s;tice has got into a cur&s;ed hovel.&endq;
Mr. Gobble him&s;elf &s;eemed to be of
the &s;ame opinion. He changed co|lour
&s;everal times during the remarks
which the lawyers had made; and
now, declaring that the gentlemen
were at liberty, begged, in the mo&s;t
humble phra&s;e, that the company
would eat a bit of mutton with him,
and after dinner the affair might be
amicably compromi&s;ed. To this pro|po&s;al
our adventurer replied, in a
grave and re&s;olute tone, &startq;If your
<PB N="249" REF="254">
acting in the commi&s;&s;ion as a ju&s;tice
of the peace concerned my own par|ticular
only, perhaps I &s;hould wave
any further inquiry, and re&s;ent your
in&s;olence no other way but by &s;ilent
contempt. If I thought the er|rors
of your admini&s;tration proceeded
from a good intention, defeated by
want of under&s;tanding, I &s;hould pity
your ignorance, and, in compa&s;&s;ion,
advi&s;e you to de&s;i&s;t from acting a part
for which you are &s;o ill qualified:
but the prepo&s;terous conduct of &s;uch
a man deeply affects the intere&s;t of
the community, e&s;pecially that part
of it which, from its helple&s;s &s;itua|tion,
is the more entitled to our pro|tection
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I am more|over
convinced, that your mi&s;con|duct
is not &s;o much the con&s;equence
of an uninformed head, as the poi|&s;onous
i&s;&s;ue of a malignant heart, de|void
of humanity, inflamed with pride,
and rankling with revenge. The
common pri&s;on of this little town is
filled with the mi&s;erable objects of
your cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion. In&s;tead
of protecting the helple&s;s, re&s;training
<PB N="250" REF="255">
the hands of violence, pre&s;erving the
public tranquility, and acting as a fa|ther
to the poor, according to the in|tent
and meaning of that in&s;titution
of which you are an unworthy mem|ber,
you have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the widow
and the orphan, given a loo&s;e to all
the in&s;olence of office, embroiled your
neighbours by fomenting &s;uits and ani|mo&s;ities,
and played the tyrant among
the indigent and forlorn. You have
abu&s;ed the authority with which you
were inve&s;ted, intailed a reproach up|on
your office, and, in&s;tead of being
revered as a ble&s;&s;ing, you are dete&s;ted
as a cur&s;e among your fellow-crea|tures.
This, indeed, is generally the
ca&s;e of low fellows, who are thru&s;t
into the magi&s;tracy without &s;entiment,
education, or capacity. Among other
in&s;tances of your iniquity, there is
now in pri&s;on an unhappy woman,
infinitely your &s;uperior in the advan|tages
of birth, &s;en&s;e, and education,
whom you have, even without pro|vocation,
per&s;ecuted to ruin and di|&s;traction,
after having illegally and
inhumanly kidnapped her only child,
<PB N="251" REF="256">
and expo&s;ed him to violent death in a
foreign land. Ah caitiff! if you were
to forego all the comforts of life, di|&s;tribute
your means among the poor,
and do the &s;evere&s;t penance that ever
prie&s;tcraft pre&s;cribed, for the re&s;t of your
days, you could not atone for the ruin
of that haple&s;s family; a family through
who&s;e &s;ides you cruelly and perfidi|ou&s;ly
&s;tabbed the heart of an innocent
young woman, to gratify the pride
and diabolical malice of that wretched
low-bred woman, who now &s;its at
your right hand as the a&s;&s;ociate of
power and pre&s;umption. Oh! if
&s;uch a de&s;picable reptile &s;hall annoy
mankind with impunity; if &s;uch a
contemptible mi&s;creant &s;hall have it in
his power to do &s;uch deeds of inhu|manity
and oppre&s;&s;ion, what avails
the law? Where is our admired con|&s;titution,
the freedom, the &s;ecurity
of the &s;ubject, the boa&s;ted humanity
of the Briti&s;h nation? Sacred Hea|ven!
if there was no human in&s;titu|tion
to take cognizance of &s;uch atro|cious
crimes, I would li&s;ten to the
dictates of eternal ju&s;tice, and, arm|ing
<PB N="252" REF="257">
my&s;elf with the right of nature,
exterminate &s;uch villains from the
face of the earth!&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words he pronounced in
&s;uch a &s;train, while his eyes lightened
with indignation, that Gobble and his
wife underwent the mo&s;t violent agi|tation;
the con&s;table's teeth chattered
in his head, the jailor trembled, and
the whole audience was overwhelmed
with con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort pau&s;e, Sir Launcelot
proceeded in a milder &s;train: &startq;Thank
Heaven, the laws of this country have
exempted me from the di&s;agreeable
ta&s;k of &s;uch an execution. To them
we &s;hall have immediate recour&s;e, in
three &s;eparate actions again&s;t you for
fal&s;e impri&s;onment; and any other
per&s;on who has been injured by your
arbitrary and wicked proceedings, in
me &s;hall find a warm protector, until
you &s;hall be expunged from the com|mi&s;&s;ion
with di&s;grace, and have made
&s;uch retaliation as your circum&s;tances
will allow for the wrongs you have
done the community.&endq;</P>
<P>In order to complete the mortifica|tion
<PB N="253" REF="258">
and terror of the ju&s;tice, the
lawyer, who&s;e name was Fenton, de|clared,
that, to his certain knowledge,
the&s;e actions would be reinforced with
divers pro&s;ecutions for corrupt practi|ces,
which had lain dormant until
&s;ome per&s;on of courage and influence
&s;hould take the lead again&s;t ju&s;tice
Gobble, who was the more dreaded
as he acted under the patronage of
lord Sharpington. By this time fear
had deprived the ju&s;tice and his help|mate
of the faculty of &s;peech. They
were indeed almo&s;t petrified with di&s;|may,
and made no effort to &s;peak,
when Mr. Fillet, in the rear of the
knight, as he retired with his com|pany,
took his leave of them in the&s;e
words:</P>
<P>&startq;And now, Mr. Ju&s;tice, to din|ner
with what appetite you may.&endq;
Our adventurer, though warmly in|vited
to Mr. Fenton's hou&s;e, repaired
to a public inn, where he thought
he &s;hould be more at his ea&s;e, fully
determined to puni&s;h and depo&s;e Gob|ble
from his magi&s;tracy, to effect a
general jail-delivery of all the debtors
<PB N="254" REF="259">
whom he had found in confinement;
and, in particular, to re&s;cue poor Mrs.
Oakley from the mi&s;erable circum|&s;tances
in which &s;he was involved.</P>
<P>In the mean time, he in&s;i&s;ted up|on
entertaining his friends at dinner,
during which many &s;allies of &s;ea-wit
and good-humour pa&s;&s;ed between
captain Crowe and doctor Fillet,
which la&s;t had ju&s;t returned from a
neighbouring village, whither he was
&s;ummoned to fi&s;h a man's yard-arm,
which had &s;napt in the &s;lings. Their
enjoyment, however, was &s;uddenly
interrupted by a loud &s;cream from the
kitchen, whither Sir Launcelot im|mediately
&s;prung, with equal eager|ne&s;s
and agility. There he &s;aw the
landlady, who was a woman in years,
embracing a man dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's
jacket, while &s;he exclaimed, &startq;It is
thy own fle&s;h and blood, &s;o &s;ure as
I'm a living &s;oul.&mdash;Ah! poor Greaves,
poor Greaves, many a poor heart has
grieved for thee!&endq; To this &s;alutation
the youth replied, &startq;I'm &s;orry for
that, mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;How does poor mo|ther?
how does Sukey Sedgemore?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260">
The good woman of the hou&s;e
could not help &s;hedding tears at the&s;e
interrogations; while Sir Launcelot,
interpo&s;ing, &s;aid, not without emo|tion,
&startq;I perceive you are the &s;on of
Mrs. Oakley.&mdash;Your mother is in a
bad &s;tate of health; but in me you
will find a real parent.&endq; Perceiving
that the young man eyed him with
a&s;toni&s;hment, he gave him to under|&s;tand
that his name was Launcelot
Greaves.</P>
<P>Oakley no &s;ooner heard the&s;e words
pronounced, than he fell upon his
knees, and &s;eizing the knight's hand,
ki&s;&s;ed it eagerly, crying, &startq;God for
ever ble&s;s your honour: I am your
name-&s;on, &s;ure enough&mdash;but what of
that? I can earn my bread, without
being beholden to any man.&endq;</P>
<P>When the knight rai&s;ed him up, he
turned to the woman of the hou&s;e,
&s;aying, &startq;I want to &s;ee mother. I'm
afraid as how times are hard with her;
and I have &s;aved &s;ome money for her
u&s;e.&endq; This in&s;tance of filial duty
brought tears into the eyes of our ad|venturer,
<PB N="256" REF="261">
who a&s;&s;ured him his mo|ther
&s;hould be carefully attended, and
want for nothing: but that it would
be very improper to &s;ee her at pre&s;ent,
as the &s;urprize might &s;hock her too
much, con&s;idering that &s;he believed
him dead. &startq;Ey, indeed, (cried the
landlady) we were all of the &s;ame
opinion, being as the report went that
poor Greaves Oakley was killed in
battle.&endq; &startq;Lord mi&s;tre&s;s, (&s;aid Oak|ley)
there wan'n't a word of truth in it,
I'll a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;What, d'ye think I'd
tell a lie about the matter? Hurt I
was, to be &s;ure; but that don't &s;ignify:
we gave 'em as good as they brought,
and &s;o parted.&mdash;Well, if &s;o be I can't
&s;ee mother, I'll go and have &s;ome chat
with Sukey.&mdash;What d'ye look &s;o glum
for? &s;he an't married, is &s;he?&endq; &startq;No,
no, (replied the woman) not mar|ried;
but almo&s;t heart-broken. Since
thou wa&s;t gone, &s;he has done nothing
but &s;ighed, and wept, and pined her|&s;elf
into a decay. I'm afraid thou ha'&s;t
come too late to &s;ave her life.&endq;</P>
<P>Oakley's heart was not proof again&s;t
this information. Bur&s;ting into tears,
<PB N="257" REF="262">
he exclaimed, &startq;O my dear, &s;weet,
gentle Sukey! Have I then lived to be
the death of her whom I loved more
than the whole world!&endq; He would
have gone in&s;tantly to her father's
hou&s;e; but was re&s;trained by the knight
and his company, who had now joined
him in the kitchen. The young man
was &s;eated at table, and gave them to
under&s;tand, that the &s;hip to which he
belonged having arrived in England,
he was indulged with a month's leave
to &s;ee his relations; and that he had
received about fifty pounds in wages
and prize-money. After dinner, ju&s;t
as they began to deliberate upon the
mea&s;ures to be taken again&s;t Gobble,
that gentleman arrived at the inn, and
humbly craved admittance. Mr. Fil|let,
&s;truck with a &s;udden idea, retired
into another apartment with the young
farmer; while the ju&s;tice, being ad|mitted
to the company, declared that
he came to propo&s;e terms of accom|modation.
He accordingly offered to
a&s;k pardon of Sir Launcelot in the pub|lic
papers, and pay fifty pounds to the
poor of the pari&s;h, as an atonement
<PB N="258" REF="263">
for his misbehaviour, provided the
knight and his friends would grant
him a general relea&s;e. Our adventurer
told him, he would willingly wave
all per&s;onal conce&s;&s;ions; but, as the
ca&s;e concerned the community, he in|&s;i&s;ted
upon his leaving off acting in
the commi&s;&s;ion, and making &s;atisfac|tion
to the parties he had injured and
oppre&s;&s;ed. This declaration introdu|ced
a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in the cour&s;e of which
the ju&s;tice's petulance began to revive;
when Fillet, entering the room, told
them he had a reconciling mea&s;ure to
propo&s;e, if Mr. Gobble would for a
few minutes withdraw. He ro&s;e up
immediately, and was &s;hewn into the
room which Fillet had prepared for his
reception. While he &s;at mu&s;ing on
this untoward adventure, &s;o big with
di&s;grace and di&s;appointment, young
Oakley, according to the in&s;tructions
he had received, appeared all at once
before him, pointing to a gha&s;tly
wound, which the doctor had painted
on his forehead. The apparition no
&s;ooner pre&s;ented it&s;elf to the eyes of
Gobble, than, taking it for granted it
<PB N="259" REF="264">
was the &s;pirit of the young farmer
who&s;e death he had occa&s;ioned, he
roared aloud, &startq;Lord have mercy up|on
us!&endq; and fell in&s;en&s;ible on the floor.
There being found by the company,
to whom Fillet had communicated
his contrivance, he was conveyed to
bed, where he lay &s;ome time before
he recovered the perfect u&s;e of his &s;en|&s;es.
Then he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee
the knight, and a&s;&s;ured him he was
ready to comply with his terms, ina&s;|much
as he believed he had not long
to live. Advantage was immediately
taken of this &s;alutary di&s;po&s;ition. He
bound him&s;elf not to act as a ju&s;tice
of the peace, in any part of Great-Britain,
under the penalty of five
thou&s;and pounds. He burned Mrs.
Oakley's note; payed the debts of the
&s;hopkeeper; undertook to compound
tho&s;e of the publican, and to &s;ettle
him again in bu&s;ine&s;s; and, finally,
di&s;charged them all from pri&s;on, pay|ing
the dues out of his own pocket.
The&s;e &s;teps being taken with peculiar
eagerne&s;s, he was removed to his own
hou&s;e, where he a&s;&s;ured his wife he
<PB N="260" REF="265">
had &s;een a vi&s;ion that progno&s;ticated
his death; and had immediate re|cour&s;e
to the curate of the pari&s;h for
&s;piritual con&s;olation.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of the
ta&s;k that now remained, was to make
the widow Oakley acquainted with
her good fortune, in &s;uch a manner
as might lea&s;t di&s;turb her &s;pirits, al|ready
but too much di&s;compo&s;ed.
For this purpo&s;e they cho&s;e the land|lady,
who, after having received pro|per
directions how to regulate her
conduct, vi&s;ited her in pri&s;on that &s;ame
evening. Finding her quite calm,
and her reflection perfectly re&s;tored,
&s;he began with exhorting her to put
her tru&s;t in Providence, which would
never for&s;ake the cau&s;e of the injured
widow and fatherle&s;s: &s;he promi&s;ed
to a&s;&s;i&s;t and befriend her on all oc|ca&s;ions,
as far as her abilities would
reach: &s;he gradually turned the con|ver&s;ation
upon the family of the
Greaves; and by degrees informed
her, that Sir Launcelot, having learn|ed
her &s;ituation, was determined to
extricate her from all her troubles.
<PB N="261" REF="266">
Perceiving her a&s;toni&s;hed, and deeply
affected at this intimation, &s;he artfully
&s;hifted the di&s;cour&s;e, recommended
re&s;ignation to the Divine Will, and
ob&s;erved, that this circum&s;tance &s;eem|ed
to be an earne&s;t of further happi|ne&s;s.
&startq;O! I'm incapable of receiv|ing
more! (cried the di&s;con&s;olate wi|dow,
with &s;treaming eyes)&mdash;Yet I
ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at any ble&s;&s;ing
that flows from that quarter.&mdash;The
family of Greaves were always vir|tuous,
humane, and benevolent.&mdash;
This young gentleman's mother was
my dear lady and benefactre&s;s:&mdash;he
him&s;elf was &s;uckled at the&s;e brea&s;ts.
&mdash;O! he was the &s;weete&s;t, comelie&s;t,
be&s;t conditioned babe!&mdash;I loved not
my own Greaves with greater affection
&mdash;but, he, alas! is now no more!&endq;
&startq;Have patience, good neighbour,
(&s;aid the landlady of the White Hart)
that is more than you have any right
to affirm.&mdash;All that you know of the
matter is by common report, and
common report is commonly fal&s;e:
be&s;ides, I can tell you I have &s;een a
li&s;t of the men that were killed in ad|miral
<PB N="262" REF="267">
P&mdash;'s &s;hip, when he &s;ought
the French in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and
your &s;on was not in the number.&endq;
To this intimation &s;he replied, after a
con&s;iderable pau&s;e, &startq;Don't, my good
neighbour, don't feed me with fal&s;e
hope.&mdash;My poor Greaves too certainly
peri&s;hed in a foreign land&mdash;yet he is
happy:&mdash;had he lived to &s;ee me in
this condition, grief would &s;oon have
put a period to his days.&endq; &startq;I tell
you then, (cried the vi&s;itant) he is
not dead. I have &s;een a letter that
mentions his being well &s;ince the bat|tle.
You &s;hall come along with me&mdash;
you are no longer a pri&s;oner, but &s;hall
live at my hou&s;e comfortably, till your
affairs are &s;ettled to your wi&s;h.&endq;</P>
<P>The poor widow followed her in
&s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, and was imme|diately
accommodated with nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>Next morning her ho&s;te&s;s proceed|ed
with her in the &s;ame cautious man|ner,
until &s;he was a&s;&s;ured that her
&s;on had returned. Being duly pre|pared,
&s;he was ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;ight of
poor Greaves, and fainted away in
his arms.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="268">
We &s;hall not dwell upon this ten|der
&s;cene, becau&s;e it is but of a &s;econ|dary
concern in the hi&s;tory of our
knight-errant: let it &s;uffice to &s;ay,
their mutual happine&s;s was un&s;peak|able.
She was afterwards vi&s;ited by Sir
Launcelot, whom &s;he no &s;ooner be|held,
than, &s;pringing forwards with
all the eagerne&s;s of maternal affection,
&s;he cla&s;ped him to her brea&s;t, crying,
&startq;My dear child! my Launcelot!
my pride! my darling! my kind be|nefactor!
This is not the fir&s;t time I
have hugged you in the&s;e arms! O!
you are the very image of Sir Ever|hard
in his youth; but you have got
the eyes, the complexion, the &s;weet|ne&s;s,
and complacency of my dear
and ever-honoured lady.&endq; This was
not in the &s;train of hireling prai&s;e;
but the genuine tribute of e&s;teem and
admiration. As &s;uch, it could not
but be agreeable to our hero, who
undertook to procure Oakley's di&s;|charge,
and &s;ettle him in a comfort|able
farm on his own e&s;tate.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Greaves went
with a heavy heart to the hou&s;e of
<PB N="264" REF="269">
farmer Sedgemore, where he found
Sukey, who had been prepared for
his reception, in a tran&s;port of joy,
though very weak, and greatly ema|ciated.
Neverthele&s;s, the return of
her &s;weet-heart had &s;uch an happy
effect on her con&s;titution, that in a
few weeks her health was perfectly
re&s;tored.</P>
<P>This adventure of our knight was
crowned with every happy circum|&s;tance
that could give plea&s;ure to a
generous mind. The pri&s;oners were
relea&s;ed, and rein&s;tated in their for|mer
occupations. The ju&s;tice per|formed
his articles from fear; and
afterwards turned over a new leaf
from remor&s;e. Young Oakley was
married to Sukey, with whom he re|ceived
a con&s;iderable portion. The
new-married couple found a farm
ready &s;tocked for them on the knight's
e&s;tate; and the mother enjoyed a
happy retreat in the character of the
hou&s;e-keeper at Greave&s;bury-hall.</P>
