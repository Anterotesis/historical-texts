<HEAD>SOME PARTICULARS OF <HI>THE LIFE</HI> OF THE LATE GEORGE COLMAN, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Richmond,</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec. 4th,</HI> 1787.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FOR &s;ome years pa&s;t I have entertained an idea of leaving behind me &s;ome particulars of my life, which I flattered my&s;elf might not be quite unintere&s;ting, or unentertaining; or at lea&s;t prove more &s;a|tisfactory than the anecdotes retailed by &s;ome chance biographer, who might per|haps be induced to confer on me the honours that have lately been as liberally be&s;towed on per&s;ons of as little importance. Much bu&s;ine&s;s, much illne&s;s, and perhaps
<PB N="2" REF="5">
&s;ome idlene&s;s, have from time to time pro|tracted my commencement of the work, and thinking it not impo&s;&s;ible, nor indeed improbable, that the &s;ame cau&s;es may &s;till prevail, &s;o as at lea&s;t to hinder the com|pletion of it, I now &s;it down to give an account of &s;ome circum&s;tances, touching what has been commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be the leading feature in my character; but in which the world has been mo&s;t gro&s;sly deceived, and mi&s;taken, as the following narration and documents will &s;ufficiently te&s;tify.</P>
<P>It has, I know, long been taken for granted, that &s;uch was the &s;trength of my predilection for theatrical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that I would in &s;pite of all competition, and with|out he&s;itation, forego all other expecta|tions, however magnificent or alluring; and that at a certain aera of my life, about
<PB N="3" REF="6">
twenty years ago, this po&s;ition was mo&s;t fully verified.</P>
<P>Nothing but my re&s;pect and gratitude for the memory of tho&s;e, from who&s;e bounty I &s;till derive a con&s;iderable part of my income, determined me to abide and patiently endure the contempt and obloquy that &s;uch a received opinion brought upon me, le&s;t by vindicating my&s;elf from cau&s;e|le&s;s &s;lander, I might appear willing to throw a &s;tain on tho&s;e who had done much for me, merely becau&s;e they had not done more.</P>
<P>This opinion of my character has been chiefly founded on two propo&s;itions, both of which, with as much delicacy as the truth will admit, I &s;hall &s;hew to be ground|le&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e propo&s;itions is, that by my literary pur&s;uits, and dramatic com|po&s;itions,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
I lo&s;t the favour and affection of the Earl of BATH.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is, that by my purcha&s;e of a fourth of the patent of Covent Garden theatre, I knowingly and voluntarily for|feited the intended beque&s;t of the Newport e&s;tate under the will of General PUL|TENEY.</P>
<P>That I had an early ta&s;te and reli&s;h for polite literature, and particularly for com|po&s;itions of the &s;tage, is mo&s;t true; nor will I pretend to deny that I was betrayed into youthful follies and irregularities, which involved me in temporary incon|veniencies and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. To extricate my&s;elf from the embarra&s;&s;ments that tho&s;e follies, ill &s;uited to narrow circum&s;tances, brought upon me, I had recour&s;e to my pen, which was then rarely u&s;ed, drama|tically,
<PB N="5" REF="8">
or otherwi&s;e, but with a view to profit: the Earl of BATH, however, was &s;o little di&s;plea&s;ed with the&s;e efforts, that he even countenanced and encouraged them, and often deigned to con&s;ider them as the earne&s;t of &s;omething better that was to follow. So dear, indeed, did he hold me, that he has not only in words and in writing told me that he con&s;idered me as his &s;econd &s;on, but, in &s;everal wills and te&s;taments executed during that period, and during the life of my dear friend and kin&s;man, Lord PULTENEY, ab&s;olutely te&s;tified that he regarded me in that light; nor did any of my theatrical productions abate his affection, or in the lea&s;t tend to alter his intentions. A more fatal event was the cau&s;e of &s;uch alterations; I mean the early and unexpected death of Lord PULTENEY. From that moment he new modelled his will, in which he &s;till made
<PB N="6" REF="9">
a hand&s;ome provi&s;ion for me, but left it to the di&s;cretion of General PULTENEY to con&s;ign, or not con&s;ign to me the e&s;tate, which he had, in many preceding wills, ab&s;olutely devi&s;ed to me, in ca&s;e of the death of his only &s;on, Lord PULTENEY.</P>
<P>The little that has been already &s;aid on this &s;ubject, is, perhaps, more than &s;uffici|ent to re&s;ute the charge contained in the fir&s;t propo&s;ition; but it may not be ami&s;s to &s;peak of one or two circum&s;tances, be|fore we entirely di&s;mi&s;s it. I have men|tioned, that Lord BATH con&s;idered me as his &s;econd &s;on; and, indeed, his avowed partiality for me, induced many per&s;ons, not intimately acquainted with the hi&s;tory and connections of the family, to think me really &s;o, and of con&s;equence to report it as a fact. Not to dwell on the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the &s;uppo&s;ition, implying a criminal in|tercour&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="10">
between his lord&s;hip and his wife's &s;i&s;ter, there were certain phy&s;ical impo&s;&s;ibilities in the ca&s;e. My mother went over to my father, who was re&s;ident at Florence, &s;our or five years before I was born. Mr. PULTENEY and his family were in England; I had a &s;i&s;ter born there two years before me, &s;o that neither of us, na|tives of Florence, could derive our origin from my mother's brother in law, con&s;i|dering the unfortunate intervention of the Alps and the Mediterranean. We had, in|deed, each of us, the honour of a royal godfather and godmother, as children of a Briti&s;h plenipotentiary, from whom we took our &s;everal names of GEORGE and CAROLINE.</P>
<P>The other $$$cum&s;tances referred to above, come clo&s;er to the point in que&s;|tion, and, indeed, form a nece&s;&s;ary chain
<PB N="8" REF="11">
in the &s;ucceeding narrative; and it gives me no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to be able to &s;eize this opportunity of paying a due tribute of affection and re&s;pect to a mo&s;t ingeni|ous, learned, and worthy man. The &s;tory will &s;peak$h clogium. The man I mean was my mo&s;t e&s;teemed and honoured friend the late Mr. BOOTH of Lincoln's Inn.</P>
<P>It was Mr. BOOTH who fir&s;t acquaint|ed me, very &s;oon after the irretrievable lo&s;s of poor Lord PULTENEY, of the new arrangements of Lord BATH'S affairs. His lord&s;hip, however, &s;ays he, a&s;&s;ures me he has taken care of you; but that care, I dare &s;ay, will be very unequal to his ori|ginal intentions. The world &s;uppo&s;es, that the death of LORD PULTENEY is a great event in your fortune. You and I know the contrary; and if you have a mind, I will &s;till endeavour to enable you
<PB N="9" REF="12">
to make your fortune another way. Though you are my neighbour in Lin|coln's Inn, and have your chambers in the next &s;tair-ca&s;e to mine, yet I believe you have not hitherto thought of the law &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly as I have done. If you have talents for the bar, you may make much more money than ever I have made; my reli|gion has prevented my appearance there; yet my gains have not been incon&s;idera|ble, though le&s;s than what they have been rated. If you do <HI>not</HI> attend the bar, &s;till the law is no mean re&s;ource. I will, if you plea&s;e, give you a plan of &s;tudy; I will &s;hew you every ca&s;e I ever an&s;wered, and explain to you the principles on which I founded my opinions. <HI>My life is wearing; and as I go out of bu&s;ine&s;s, I will make it a point to bring you into it.</HI></P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of what this good friend &s;aid to me on this occa&s;ion. I
<PB N="10" REF="13">
have every where endeavoured to clothe the matter as near as po&s;&s;ible in his own expre&s;&s;ions, and to the la&s;t words I could almo&s;t venture to &s;wear.</P>
<P>Though he had for &s;ome time &s;hewed me many civilities, and even marks of friend|&s;hip, yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s that this touching in&s;tance of it almo&s;t overcame me.</P>
<P>Penetrated with his kindne&s;s, and &s;truck with the nicety of my &s;ituation, I &s;eriou&s;ly determined to avail my&s;elf of his mo&s;t friendly offer, and to follow his advice. Lord BATH, to the day of his death, con|tinued his favour and protection to me. I entered his hou&s;e as familiarly as my own chambers, and occupied without invita|tion a place at his table.</P>
<P>On his death, his brother, General PUL|TENEY, received me as a friend, and gave
<PB N="11" REF="14">
me to under&s;tand that I was <HI>un enfant de famille,</HI> that mu&s;t not be overlooked or neglected. He told me, that he &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould no longer think of the profe&s;&s;ion to which I had been de&s;tined, and made me a pre&s;ent of his chariot. Such a call <HI>from</HI> the bar was too tempting to be re|&s;i&s;ted, and I accordingly quitted my tye wig, gown, and band, and my chambers at Lincoln's Inn.</P>
<P>I did not, however, roll long in the ge|neral's carriage without &s;ome rather di&s;a|greeable jolts in it. Malice &s;oon began her operations, and endeavoured to preju|dice him again&s;t me; yet he continued my friend, and in an&s;wer to a letter to him at Tunbridge, (of which I have no copy) he returned me the following comfortable epi&s;tle.</P>

<P>I e&s;teem you very much for your ac|knowledgment and grateful &s;en&s;e of poor Lord BATH'S affection and kindne&s;s to you, which has urged you at pre&s;ent (in writing to me,) to expre&s;s your&s;elf (with the overflowings of an hone&s;t heart) in &s;o very obliging a manner, that if I had no other motive, it would be &s;ufficient to make me love you with great cordiality and kindne&s;s to my life's end; but I will over and above a&s;&s;ure you, that I have ever loved you, and am per&s;uaded that nothing will alter my affection and opinion of your de&s;erving from me all the good that Lord BATH has vi&s;ibly de&s;igned and wi&s;hed you to enjoy; all that can be &s;aid further, mu&s;t be &s;uperfluous and un|nece&s;&s;ary; but, let me add, that I &s;hall always be glad of a vi&s;it from you: the rea&s;on that after the eleventh was menti|oned

<P>The publication of private letters I have ever thought exceptionable, unle&s;s &s;ome very particular circum&s;tances render it proper and nece&s;&s;ary to produce them. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I do not &s;ee how I can otherwi&s;e vindicate my character; and
<PB N="14" REF="17">
therefore I tru&s;t that my memory will not be loaded with reproach, merely for an act of &s;elf ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more open and direct than the contents of the above letter; yet &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent events, too &s;trong not to be noticed, but yet too minute to be re|capitulated, made me conceive it more than barely po&s;&s;ible that the General would on &s;ome pretence, render void his mo&s;t ex|plicit and voluntary declaration. Under this per&s;ua&s;ion I thought it advi&s;able to &s;ecure to my&s;elf, i&s; po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome advan|tages more &s;olid and permanent, than an annuity which was to vani&s;h with my life, and might render it impo&s;&s;ible for me to provide for any &s;urivor,</P>
<P>At this critical time, an offer was made me of a &s;hare in Covent Garden theatre, and I had before had the refu&s;al of Mr.
<PB N="15" REF="18">
GARRICK'S &s;hare at Drury Lane. Still, however, I did not enter ha&s;tily into the&s;e undertakings, without attention to the a&s;&s;u|rances I had received, and which were now put to the te&s;t. In March 1767, I &s;igned an agreement with my friend POWELL, and the other intended purcha&s;ers of Covent Garden theatre, under a penalty of three thou&s;and pounds, in ca&s;e of non-perform|ance. I afterwards went to Bath, where I received a letter from General PULTENEY, in an&s;wer to one of mine, of which I have no copy, but of which the &s;ub&s;tance may be collected from his an&s;wer, and my re|ply.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear COLMAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received your letter from Bath, which &s;urpri&s;es me not a little, to find in your letters the &s;ame jealou&s;y and reproach
<PB N="16" REF="19">
as I met with the la&s;t year, from Bath, which were, as I told you then, fal&s;ely grounded from malice and curio&s;ity, and now again I am the more convinced of it, for I declare to you, that I never gave any cau&s;e, to any one what&s;oever, that from any report in your disfavour that I had the lea&s;t thought of paying any regard to it, nor indeed have any per&s;ons, by mi&s;|repre&s;enting you, ever taken that liberty to &s;peak of you di&s;advantageou&s;ly; for it is well known the veneration I have for every thing Lord BATH has recommend|ed, and I will a&s;&s;ure you over and above, that I have a long rooted di&s;po&s;ition in me to befriend you in all things; yet I can &s;ee &s;ome things that are not greatly plea&s;|ing, as mo&s;t certainly the letter which you &s;peak of was rather too ludicrous to be writ to an old gentleman, and your friend, which I found fault with, and I did not
<PB N="17" REF="20">
expect to find it ju&s;tified, by urging that I went to coun&s;ell in di&s;aproving of it, for I think the impropriety of it, would have been di&s;aproved off by a weaker judgem^t. Y^r jealou&s;y about your connection may be founded with rea&s;on, but however that may appear to the world, and may give me a concern, I had not deviated from my own good will, nor from L^d BATH'S inten|tion. I have thus far explained my affec|tion to you this once; but I hope you will give no farther attention to the malice or curio&s;ity of Bath acquaintance, but to di&s;|regard them, as I &s;hall do, if it continues; but otherwi&s;e, re&s;t a&s;&s;ured y^t I am inclined and very de&s;irous of being always, your faithful</P>

<P>Plea&s;e to accept my warme&s;t acknow|ledgments of your kind letter, and give me leave to a&s;&s;ure you that I &s;hall ever entertain the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;e of your goodne&s;s to me on this and every other occa&s;ion. The &s;ole meaning of my la&s;t was to acquit my&s;elf of di&s;re&s;pect or ingra|titude: I was con&s;cious that I had never con&s;ulted lawyers on the &s;ubject there mentioned, which I under&s;tood had been in&s;inuated to you, and I thought my&s;elf bound in duty to you to wipe off the re|proach that &s;uch an imputation carried with it.</P>

<P>From this reply it is evident that the General mi&s;under&s;tood what I had &s;aid in my fir&s;t letter, concerning the con&s;ulta|tion of coun&s;el; yet my unhappy attempts
<PB N="19" REF="22">
at raillery and plea&s;antry, always &s;o well received by Lord BATH, were rather in|judiciou&s;ly directed to his brother, and my inexperience and want of due knowledge of the world, mu&s;t be my only apology. It is likely too, that I might be more anxious than ordinary, from a &s;en&s;e of the coven|ant I had recently, and, perhaps, too ha&s;tily entered into, ju&s;t before I left London. And before my return from Bath, early in May, the expected revolution in the &s;tate of Covent Garden had become a &s;ubject of public conver&s;ation, and of cour&s;e furni&s;h|ed materials for &s;undry paragraphs in the news papers. I waited immediately on General PULTENEY, who received me as cordially as ever. We had a full and free conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject. He expre&s;&s;ed neither warmth nor anger on the occa&s;ion; but on the whole &s;eemed rather to di&s;ap|prove of the undertaking. In con&s;equence
<PB N="20" REF="23">
of which, the following letters pa&s;t be|tween us.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to conceive or ex|pre&s;s the unea&s;ine&s;s I have &s;uffered &s;ince my return from Bath. The late alteration in my circum&s;tances was of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to make me very indifferent about the en|gagements I had entered into, whatever advantages they might promi&s;e; but the hint you gave me of your di&s;approbation of them, made me earne&s;tly endeavour to extricate my&s;elf. The difficulties that at|tended tho&s;e endeavours have only &s;erved to add to my unea&s;ine&s;s; but it is now confidently &s;aid, that other bidders will ap|pear, and this, or &s;ome other unfore&s;een circum&s;tance will, I hope, &s;till defeat the purcha&s;e; if not, I have no re&s;ource but to break through my engagement, and &s;ub|mit
<PB N="21" REF="24">
to a penalty of three thou&s;and pounds. Judge then of the di&s;traction of my mind, between the fear of di&s;plea&s;ing you, and &s;o di&s;agreeable an alternative.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay any thing in vindication of the undertaking. It &s;eems to be di&s;agree|able to you, and that is enough to make me repent of having thought of it. Before it was propo&s;ed to me, I knew that Sir WILLIAM DAVENANT was the original proprietor of this very patent; that Sir RICHARD STEELE had received from the Crown a favour of the &s;ame nature; that Sir JOHN VANBURGH not only built the theatre in the Hay-market, but was actually engaged in the management of it, as well as Mr. CONGREVE in that of Lincoln's Inn Fields; not to mention &s;everal gentle|men now living of rank and fortune &s;upe|rior to my own, who had formed the like
<PB N="22" REF="25">
intentions; &s;o that I really did not think of bringing any reflections on my&s;elf, or tho&s;e who had honoured me with their countenance and protection. Any thing that might carry the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of di&s;re&s;pect to you was the farthe&s;t from my thoughts, and I cannot but be mi&s;era|ble while I &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf liable even to the &s;u&s;picion of it. As to my precipita|tion in this affair, I feel the con&s;equences of it but too &s;en&s;ibly.</P>

<P>Before this reaches your hands, you will have been appri&s;ed, by the papers, of the completion of an affair, which I do a&s;&s;ure you, I have taken every method to avoid, &s;ince I under&s;tood it was at all di&s;|agreeable

to you. The other bidders talked &s;o very confidently of advancing upon our price, that, till la&s;t Thur&s;day was over, I was never thoroughly per|&s;uaded that our party would be the real purcha&s;ers; and if our opponents had ever produced the money to back their a&s;&s;ertions, it would have afforded me an opportunity to recede, which I &s;hould mo&s;t certainly have embraced.

</LETTER>
<P>In the tran&s;cribing the letters of General PULTENEY, the abbreviations, punctua|tion, and orthography, have been religi|ou&s;ly pre&s;erved; not from any de&s;ire of noting any peculiarities, but merely to mark the &s;trict exactne&s;s of the copies. The originals are depo&s;ited with my exe|cutors, who I hope will as &s;peedily as po&s;|&s;ible, after entering on the office they have kindly taken upon them, lay the&s;e &s;heets before the public.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31">
From the&s;e letters, and my an&s;wers, of which the rough draughts are al&s;o left with my executors, I think will mo&s;t evi|dently appear the fal&s;ehood and ab&s;urdity of the &s;econd propo&s;ition. I &s;hewed the General's letter of June 10^t^h, in an&s;wer to mine of the 7^t^h, to &s;everal friends, GAR|RICK in particular, who all congratulated me on the contents. Truth, however, obliges me to mention, that hone&s;t JOSHUA PEELE, a chancery &s;olicitor, long employed and de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed by the family, waiting on General PUL|TENEY on bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;oon after his return from Tunbridge, the General &s;aid to him "So, COLMAN has got the playhou&s;e at la&s;t;" "Yes, &s;ays hone&s;t PEELE, (who had &s;een the General's letter) but I am glad to find that you will not cea&s;e to be
<PB N="29" REF="32">
his friend;" "No, replied the General, I will not cea&s;e to be his friend, but I will not be <HI>&s;o much</HI> his friend." The General had certainly a right to &s;ay and do as he plea&s;ed; but it might, perhaps, not un|rea&s;onably have been expected that he would have &s;aid thus much in his an&s;wer to my letter of the 7^t^h June, an an&s;wer written &s;carce three weeks before the pur|cha&s;e was completed. In that an&s;wer, he in few, but &s;trong words, &s;tates our long friend&s;hip, his leave and con&s;ent that I &s;hould not incur the penalty of my agree|ment, and his a&s;&s;urance that he would not cea&s;e to be my friend. This a&s;&s;urance, connected with his preceding letters, letters particularly &s;hewing <HI>how</HI> he would be my friend, was &s;urely not to be received as a forerunner to his &s;ub&s;equent conduct. Nor can I conceive that General PULTE|NEY wrote his letter of the 10^t^h of June
<PB N="30" REF="33">
under &s;uch an idea. But however that may be, his la&s;t will entirely cancelled all that part of Lord BATH's that he had promi&s;ed to confirm, relative to my &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the Newport E&s;tate, which the General commuted for an annuity of four hundred pounds per annum. Soon after General PULTENEY's death, I received a letter from Mr. PULTENEY, which I &s;ub|join, together with my an&s;wer; only for the &s;ake of having an opportunity to de|clare, that I mo&s;t intirely acquie&s;ce in the truth of the declarations made in his let|ter, as well as to te&s;tify the &s;incerity of the &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ed in my an&s;wer.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that as Lord BATH $ad named you for Mr. NEWPORT's E&s;|tate,
<PB N="31" REF="34">
the change made by General PULTE|NEY's will, tho' in favour of his right heirs, mu&s;t have been a great di&s;appoint|ment to you. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I had not the lea&s;t knowledge, till the will was read, in what manner the General had &s;et|tled that e&s;tate, or that he had done me the honour to mention my name at all in relation to it; and I further a&s;&s;ure you, that I never in my life mentioned you to the General, or did you the &s;malle&s;t preju|dice with him.</P>
<P>I ea&s;ily conceive what I my&s;elf &s;hould feel in your &s;ituation, and it will give me great plea&s;ure if by any attentions, or by any good offices in my power, I can con|tribute in any degree to dimini&s;h your re|gret, which I am &s;en&s;ible it is impo&s;&s;ible entirely to remove; and Mrs. PULTENEY,
<PB N="32" REF="35">
I can venture to a&s;&s;ure you, entertains ex|actly the &s;ame &s;entiments.</P>
<P>If you will give me leave, I will wait upon you, as &s;oon as the nece&s;&s;ary atten|tions upon this occa&s;ion are over, and I &s;hall take every opportunity to convince you, that I am,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am much obliged to you for the kind attention you have been plea&s;ed to &s;hew me in your letter: did I imagine that you would believe me, I would &s;ay, that I was not at all &s;orry for General PULTENEY'S rever&s;al of Lord BATH'S nomination of me for the Newport E&s;tate; but, &s;orry or not
<PB N="33" REF="36">
&s;orry, I do mo&s;t &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, that I am not in the lea&s;t di&s;appointed; and if I feel any regret on this occa&s;ion, it is out of regard to the memory of the General, as I could have wi&s;hed he had not taken the needle&s;s trouble of ratifying more than once under his hand a promi&s;e, which upon reflection he did not think it proper to fulfil. Be that as it may, be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that nobody congratulates you on your good fortune more &s;incerely than my&s;elf. I took the liberty of &s;ending to enquire after your health and Mrs. PUL|TENEY'S the day before ye&s;terday, and propo&s;ed waiting on you the fir&s;t oppor|tunity. Plea&s;e to pre&s;ent my be&s;t re&s;pects to Mrs. PULTENEY, and believe me,</P>
