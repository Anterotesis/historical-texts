<HEAD>An Account of the <HI>Convocati|on</HI>'s Proceedings with relation to Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN my <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI> had been publi&s;hed near Two Months, on <HI>March</HI> 1. 1710/17. I was inform'd that my Affair began to be talk'd of privately among the Members of the Convocation, and that they &s;oon intended to do &s;omewhat therein: That &s;ome of the Leading Men in the Lower Hou&s;e had been Di&s;cour&s;ing about it; and that they &s;eem'd to have &s;ome Thoughts of Appointing a &s;mall Committee of their own Hou&s;e, during the Summer Interval of Convo|cation, to examine my Papers, and give in their Report the next Winter. I &s;u&s;pected this might be &s;o &s;light a way, as &s;hould rather give a Co|lour for a De&s;ire of my not Printing this Sum|mer, than be of any great Service to me, or the Publick. I guarded therefore again&s;t that Danger; and was unwilling to promi&s;e any Delay of Printing, but upon the A&s;&s;urance of a very full, free, and &s;olemn Examination; and yet was very ready to lay my Papers be|fore any Committee of Convocation what&s;o|ever.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3" MS="Y">And, by the way, this &s;mall Tendency to|wards Examination in the Lower Hou&s;e, with $ne more Open Propo&s;al of the &s;ame Exa|mination by a Right Reverend Prelate in the $pper&punc; were all the direct Attempts of that nature, &s;o far as I have heard, which appear'd during the whole Convocation.</P>
<P>A few Days after, while I partly expected a Me&s;&s;age front the Lower Hou&s;e; that I might not be &s;urpriz'd, I drew up an An&s;wer thereto, in ca&s;e it &s;hould have prov'd as I then expected. Which An&s;wer, tho' never &s;ent, becau&s;e I had no &s;uch Me&s;&s;age, &s;hall be here in&s;erted; that the Reader may fully know my Thoughts on that Occa&s;ion.</P>

<SALUTE>Mr. PROLOCUTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce the Convocation has been pleas'd &s;o far to take Notice of me and my De&s;igns as to de&s;ire my Papers, and to appoint a Com|mittee to Examine them; I take this Opportu|nity of particularly Addre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf to them, and of Laying before them, with all due Hu|mility and Submi&s;&s;ion, what it is that I hope for, and in&s;i&s;t upon in this Matter. And I do it the more readily, not only becau&s;e the Great and Important Concerns of True Religion, of the Faith and Practice of Chri&s;tians, of the Peace of the Church, and of the Duty and Ho|nour of the Clergy are therein mo&s;t deeply con|cern'd; but becau&s;e, if this be neglected, I
<PB N="3" REF="4">
may not have &s;uch another Opportunity of $aying open my Thoughts and De&s;ires before this Church and Nation. I need not be very large here, becau&s;e that <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI> which I lately Dedicated to you, and which I &s;uppo&s;e you have all &s;een, does in great Part prevent me, and &s;hew my real Thoughts, Di&s;|coveries, and De&s;ires, to you and the Chri|&s;tian World. Only I cannot but now Obte&s;t and Conjure you, by all the mo&s;t &s;acred Ties and Obligations which lye upon you, as Men, as Chri&s;tians, as Mini&s;ters of Religion, and Re|pre&s;entatives of the main Part of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd National Church; as you all are, or pretend to be, in Earne&s;t for Truth and Genuine Chri&s;tia|nity; and as you all equally with me mu&s;t give an Account to our common Lord, of your Ma|nagement in this Weighty Matter at the great Day; That laying a&s;ide all other Regards of Par|ty, and Policy, and Names of Di&s;tinction, you will join with me in the through Examination and impartial Di&s;covery of tho&s;e Original Truths and Books of our common Chri&s;tianity, which I have to repre&s;ent to you, and lay before you. I have done my utmo&s;t in tho&s;e Matters my &s;elf: And am &s;ure I can &s;afely affirm, that I have Things to propo&s;e to you highly worthy your mo&s;t &s;olemn and publick Con&s;ideration; and &s;uch as ought not to receive any farther De|lay from you. When <HI>Hilkiah</HI> the High-Prie&s;t found the original compleat Book of the <HI>Mo&s;a|ick</HI> Law, he was not reprimanded and di&s;cou|rag'd from producing it; but had it carried im|mediately by <HI>Shaphan</HI> the Scribe to good King <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI>, and found pre&s;ently a Reformation ac|cording to it undertaken by him. Now, to &s;ay nothing of my other-Papers, I do verily believe I have found a greater Trea&s;ure, the Original
<PB N="4" REF="5">
Book of the Chri&s;tian Law, the <HI>Con&s;titutions of the Apo&s;tles</HI>, with their <HI>Doctrine</HI>, and the Genu|ine <HI>Epi&s;tles of Ignatius</HI> giving undeniable Atte&s;ta|tion to them. And &s;hall I not be permitted o|penly to produce the Books, and publickly to alledge their Credentials before the Mini&s;ters of that Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, who&s;e Appointments, who&s;e &s;acred and unalterable Appointments are there|in contain'd? Mu&s;t I be oblig'd to leave the Learned among the Clergy, and try whether the Laity, even the hone&s;t, and commonly un|learned Chri&s;tian Laity will hear me? This is what I am greatly afraid of, and would fain pre|vent if po&s;&s;ible. I earne&s;tly de&s;ire that the Ho|nour of this great Reformation, which mu&s;t en|&s;ue, may belong fir&s;t of all to the Clergy, nay to the Clergy of this Church, among whom I have the Honour to be my &s;elf numbred: And that all Dangers of Schi&s;m or Di&s;&s;ention, with all other Inconveniences both as to Church and State, may be entirely avoided by the Care and Chri&s;tian Endeavours of the Bi&s;hops and Cler|gy of the &s;ame. I &s;ay of the Bi&s;hops and Cler|gy of this Church: For I mu&s;t freely own that till the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, or both Hou&s;es of Convocation, do publickly join in recommend|ing the&s;e weighty Matters to a &s;elect Number of the mo&s;t Learned, whether in or out of Convo|cation, with a &s;olemn Commi&s;&s;ion and Charge to Examine throughly, and &s;peak their Minds freely and openly, and a like &s;olemn Promi&s;e to endeavour immediately the Correction of tho&s;e Things which on &s;uch Examination &s;hall appear not agreeable to the original Settlements of Chri&s;tianity, I &s;hall not look on any le&s;&s;er Attempts of this Nature to be of any Con&s;equence at all; nor &s;hall be moved by them to put any &s;top to my own De&s;igns on their Ac|count.
<PB N="5" REF="6">
This is my real Sen&s;e and Re&s;olution. And if the&s;e mo&s;t Sacred Mattert may not by the Convocation be thought worthy of &s;uch a publick Con&s;ideration, they cannot but be &s;up|pos'd to be plainly &s;lighted and neglected by them. Not that I &s;hall refu&s;e Copies of my Pa|pers to either Hou&s;e, or to any Committee of either Hou&s;e, in any way which &s;hall be de&s;ired by them: But that I look upon any other Me|thod as of &s;mall Con&s;equence, and utterly be|neath the Dignity and Weight of the&s;e Con|cerns; as indeed rather tending to avoid the Im|putation of an open Refu&s;al of Enquiry, than to a through Search, Examination, and Refor|mation. I have however herewith &s;ent my <HI>Di&s;|&s;ertation on the Epi&s;tles of</HI> Ignatius, to be perus'd by all that plea&s;e, before the ri&s;ing of the Con|vocation: And whenever any Committee &s;hall de&s;ire the re&s;t of my Papers, I will take all the Care I can that they may have Copies of them, and that as long as they plea&s;e: So far I mean as &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with my Obligation to the Printing and Publi&s;hing my Four Volumes this Summer: Which indeed I am &s;o far engag'd in, and the Sub&s;cribers may &s;o ju&s;tly expect it from me, that nothing le&s;s than what I have already mention'd can ju&s;tify me in putting a &s;top there|to. I have nothing more to add, but to implore the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing on your Con&s;ultations; and to pray that all may at la&s;t tend to the compleat Di&s;covery of Divine Truth, to the entire Cor|rection of modern Errors in Faith and Practice, and to the Advancement and Ha&s;tening of the coming of the Kingdom of our Lord and Savi|our. All which is &s;incerely done by,</P>

<P><PB N="6" REF="7">But all my Pro&s;pect of Examination &s;oon va|ni&s;hed away. For, after a few Days, I had a private Intimation given me that other Mea&s;ures were taken; and that I was to be publickly Cen|&s;ur'd and Excommunicated, without the Allow|ance of any Examination.</P>
<P>This was a great Surprize to me, and not ea&s;ily to be believ'd; but &s;oon appear'd to be too true. For on <HI>Friday, March</HI> 9. there were Three Speeches made again&s;t me in the Lower Hou&s;e: The fir&s;t by a Dean, who having the <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI> in his Hand, and reading out of it the Cen&s;ure which had been pa&s;s'd upon me at <HI>Cambridge</HI>, mov'd that an Addre&s;s might be made to the Upper Hou&s;e, to know their Lord&s;hips Opinion, what Notice was fit for the Convocation to take of that Book, which was Dedicated to it. This was &s;econded by a long Speech of another Dean, which agreed to the Motion, and tended to aggravate my Offence; and expre&s;s'd his utter Abhorrence of my Do|ctrine, and yet great Commi&s;eration to my Per|&s;on. This was Thirded by another Member, who was &s;horter, but in the main agreed to the Motion; with much the &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ions of ut|ter Abhorrence of my Doctrine, and great Commi&s;eration of my Per&s;on; as the for|mer Dean had us'd. So the Hou&s;e agreed to the Motion. But before this Addre&s;s came up to the Upper Hou&s;e, on <HI>Wedne&s;day March</HI> 14. the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath and Wells</HI> made a vehement Speech again&s;t me there; and mov'd that they might proceed with me as a Court. This was not then agreed to: But a Committe was appointed to meet on <HI>Saturday, March</HI>, 17. at the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s, to con&s;ider what was to be done with Relation to me. On <HI>Friday, March</HI> 16. the be|fore-mentioned
<PB N="7" REF="8">
Addre&s;s came up to the Upper Hou&s;e; and a Motion was there made, that Mr. <HI>Dodwell</HI>'s <HI>Epi&s;tolary Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> concerning the <HI>Natural Mortality of Human Souls</HI>, might be re|ferr'd to the &s;ame Committee; which was a|greed to accordingly. On <HI>Saturday, March</HI> 17. the Committee came to Two Re&s;olutions; <HI>viz.</HI> That they thought the Convocation might pro|ceed as a Court: And that &s;ince the <HI>Historical Preface</HI> was dedicated to them, it was proper to take notice of it. The &s;ame Day I &s;ent the following Letter to the Bi&s;hops a&s;&s;embled in this Committee; which coming a little too late, was only deliver'd to the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln</HI>, at who&s;e Hou&s;e they met; and &s;o it was &s;ent me back again. It was in the&s;e Words.</P>

<P>UNder&s;tanding that you are to Con&s;ider a|bout me and my Opinions this Day, I thought it very rea&s;onable and proper for me to make my Application to your Lord&s;hips, and with all due Humility and Submi&s;&s;ion to de&s;ire a fair and publick Examination of my <HI>MSS.</HI> Pa|pers, before any Cen&s;ure be pa&s;t upon me. The <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI> has &s;uch entire Relation to tho&s;e Papers, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for any to judge fair|ly concerning it, without the Peru&s;al of the other; which therefore I do humbly tender to your Con&s;ideration. And I am bold to move your Lord&s;hips, that the Reverend Dr. <HI>Smalridge</HI>, with &s;uch others as the Convocation &s;hall plea&s;e to nominate, may be directed this Summer to make a Through and Impartial Examination of
<PB N="8" REF="9">
the &s;ame Papers, and to report next Winter whe|ther in their Opinion they contain Things wor|thy of the more publick Con&s;ideration of the Convocation, and of the Chri&s;tian Church, or not. I am &s;o far from intending upon &s;mall E|vidence, or by any doubtful Opinions of my own, to make any Di&s;turbance in the Peace or Faith of the Chri&s;tian Church, that I &s;till of|fer to &s;uppre&s;s my Books, in ca&s;e that a Tenth Part of that Original Evidence which I have to produce on my Side, can be alledg'd for the op|po&s;ite Doctrines. And I have &s;o great an Aver|&s;ion to any thing that looks like Schi&s;m, that I have, as far as po&s;&s;ible, in all publick Admi|ni&s;trations, kept clo&s;e to the Rules and Wor|&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Authority in this Realm all along; and am &s;till di&s;pos'd to do &s;o; even at the &s;ame time that I was, and am fully &s;atisfied that I could make u&s;e of a much more excel|lent Way of Wor&s;hip appointed by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves. And I &s;hould &s;till think it a great Misfortune, if I or others, by any publick Re|jection of Examination in the&s;e mo&s;t Sacred Matters, or by being excluded the Communion of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, &s;hould be forc'd to do any thing which might cau&s;e the lea&s;t Di|&s;turbance or Divi&s;ion among us: All which 'tis certainly in your Lord&s;hips Power, by a fair and publick Examination, to prevent. But if the Convocation &s;hall re&s;olve on the way of Force and Per&s;ecution, in&s;tead of that of En|quiry and Examination, I pray God grant me, and all good Chri&s;tians who may be concern'd, a clear Sen&s;e what will be our Duty in that Ca&s;e; and &s;uch Chri&s;tian Faith and Patience, as will be nece&s;&s;ary under &s;uch great Trials and Afflictions for the &s;ake of our Con&s;ciences.

<P><PB N="9" REF="10">About this time it was al&s;o that, apprehend|ing hard U&s;age, and fearing I might be Cen|&s;$r'd and Excommunicated by the Convocation, without being heard in my own Vindication, I drew up a Solemn Prote&s;tation and Appeal, to be then made, when I &s;hould find my &s;elf in tho&s;e Unhappy Circum&s;tances. But this &s;hall here be omitted, becau&s;e it will more naturally come in hereafter.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday, March</HI> 19. the Re&s;olutions of the Committee were laid before the Lord Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>, their Pre&s;ident. On <HI>Wed|ne&s;day, March</HI> 21. the Archbi&s;hop's An&s;wer was return'd;
<Q>&startq;That he agreed with the Com|mittee that my Book was to be taken notice of; but as to the Manner, and whether in the way of a Court, he would take Time for &endq;Legal Advice.</Q>
On <HI>Friday, March</HI> 23. the Upper Hou&s;e appointed a Committee of their whole Hou&s;e to Sit the Day following about my Matters; and, as far as I could learn, to examine Pre&s;idents, ari&s;ing chiefly from &s;ome unpubli&s;hed Papers of Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>, which &s;eem|ed to prove that the whole Convocation might act as a Court. And now I perceiv'd that there were Three Opinions in Convocation, as to the manner of treating me; be&s;ides that of tho&s;e who were for a fair Examination. The fir&s;t was for the whole Convocation's acting as a Court, and pro|ceeding to Cen&s;ure &amp; Excommunication immedi|ately. The &s;econd for the Archbi&s;hop's doing the &s;ame things, <HI>a&s;&s;identibus &amp; con&s;entientibus Epi&s;copis</HI>, without the Lower Hou&s;e; as in his Court of Au|dience. The Third, for only pa&s;&s;ing a Syno|dical Cen&s;ure on my Book, and referring the puni&s;hing me to the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e, by a Proce&s;s in his own Court. On <HI>Tue&s;day, March</HI>

27. the Bi&s;hops &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Lower Hou&s;e, that they were adjourn'd till <HI>Wedne&s;day, April</HI> 11. and that the fir&s;t thing they would then go upon was the Method of proceeding with me. In this Interval I under&s;tood that the way which was by &s;ome at fir&s;t propos'd, <HI>viz.</HI> of go|ing upon my Matters much &s;ooner, and making the Trial or Proce&s;s more full and publick, had been overrul'd by others; and a Re&s;olution had been taken for delay, and for proceeding more &s;ummarily toward the Conclu&s;ion of the Se&s;&s;i|on. During this Interval al&s;o I drew up the following Letter to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbu|ry</HI>, as Pre&s;ident of the Convocation: Which was dated and deliver'd to him <HI>Apr.</HI> 5. Copies of which were al&s;o deliver'd to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI>; to the Prolocutor of the Lower Hou&s;e; and to &s;ome others; to be &s;hew'd, as Occa&s;ion &s;hould &s;erve: Which though it has been already made publick el&s;ewhere, yet cannot be omitted in this its proper Place.</P>

<P>SInce I perceive that my <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI> has given Offence not only to &s;everal Good Men in particular, but to the Body of the Con|vocation in general; and to many others who are really de&s;irous that Truth and primitive Chri&s;tianity may prevail; and that not only on Account of the <HI>Manner</HI> of my Writing, which &s;eems to be with too great Confidence and A&s;&s;u|rance; but al&s;o becau&s;e it looks like reviving the very <HI>Here&s;y of Arius</HI> him&s;elf, as it was condemn'd by the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>; The great Regard I have to the Peace of the Church, and my &s;in|cere de&s;ire to approve my &s;elf to my Superiors
<PB N="11" REF="12">
in it, have made me think it might be very pro|per to Addre&s;s my &s;elf to your Grace, as Pre&s;i|dent of the Convocation, upon this Occa&s;ion; to lay before you my &s;incere Thoughts as to the&s;e Matters, with the utmo&s;t Humility and Defe|rence: That I may not be e&s;teem'd &s;o perver&s;e and ob&s;tinate as not to own any Indecencies I may have been guilty of: And that I may not be charg'd with what never was in my Thoughts or De&s;igns, with regard to the Revival of the <HI>Arian</HI> Here&s;y: And at the &s;ame time to beg of your Grace to u&s;e your Endeavours that the Things I propo&s;e may not any way &s;uffer on account of any Ra&s;hne&s;s in the way of my propo&s;ing them. For as to the <HI>Manner</HI> of my Writing upon the&s;e Subjects, it is, I confe&s;s, too agreeable to the Warmth and Vehemence of my natural Temper, increas'd by an hearty, and I am &s;ure an hone&s;t Zeal for what things &s;oever at any time appear to me to be true, and of Im|portance in Chri&s;tianity. I hope God, who knows the inmo&s;t Rece&s;&s;es of my Soul, will not impute all that appears to be ra&s;h and a&s;&s;uming, to &s;uch a proud and conceited Temper as it may &s;eem to others to proceed from: And that he will mercifully forgive any Offences of that Nature, where he finds the Heart in the main &s;incere and upright; and hone&s;tly labouring, to the be&s;t of its Knowledge, to promote Truth and Piety in the World. And as I earne&s;tly wi&s;h that the uncorrupt Faith and Practice of the Go&s;pel in every Part may prevail among us, &s;o do I heartily de&s;ire that I may not be found Guilty of breaking any of the Rules of Chri|&s;tian Meekne&s;s, Humility, Mode&s;ty, and De|ference to lawful Authority, while I am aiming to promote, to the be&s;t of my Judgment and A|bility, the Purity of Chri&s;t's Religion among
<PB N="12" REF="13" MS="Y">
Men And I mu&s;t own to your Grace that I am, upon Reflection, &s;en&s;ible that in &s;everal Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and in many Circum&s;tances of my Management, I have not always kept within tho&s;e &s;trict Rules of the Go&s;pel, which the Meekne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s of Chri&s;t and his Re|ligion requires in &s;uch Ca&s;es; and that there|fore I may &s;ometimes have given Occa&s;ion of Offence to my Chri&s;tian Brethren, and to tho&s;e in Authority in particular: For which Faults, wherever they have appear'd, either by Word or Writing, as I do heartily beg Forgivene&s;s of God and of good Men, &s;o do I faithfully pro|mi&s;e that I will be more careful not to be Guilty of the &s;ame hereafter. Humbly de&s;iring that my &s;peaking plainly what I judge to be Truth, may not be e&s;teem'd ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence; that I be allow'd with a decent Freedom to pro|duce all the proper Arguments and Te&s;timonies for what I propo&s;e; and that I be permitted mode&s;tly to declare what Degree of Evidence I think I have for what I a&s;&s;ert. As to the Impu|tation of <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI>, which I confe&s;s I have not been &s;ufficiently careful to avoid, I do declare it never was my Intention to a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Arian He|re&s;y</HI>, &s;trictly &s;o called; or to revive <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">N. B. <HI>By this Here&s;y of</HI> Arius, <HI>and of his peculiar Follow|ers, as it was condemn'd at the Council of</HI> Nice; which afterward I explain more di&s;tinctly, by <HI>tho&s;e particular Novel Doctrines, and the like particular Novel Expre&s;&s;ions, of</HI> Arius <HI>him&s;elf which were condemn'd at the Council of</HI> Nice; and again by <HI>tho&s;e ra&s;h and No|vel A&s;&s;ertions and Expre&s;&s;ions of</HI> Arius, <HI>which caus'd the Di&s;tur|bances in the Church at that time, and were condemn'd by the Coun|cil of</HI> Nice; I meant and could mean only tho&s;e ra&s;h and Novel A&s;&s;ertions and Expre&s;&s;ions, which <HI>Arius</HI> and his Fol|lowers fir&s;t introduc'd into the Church, or fir&s;t di&s;turb'd the Publick about: Such as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. For as for that Council's <HI>Anathema</HI> again&s;t the U&s;e of the Word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>created</HI>, concerning our Savi|our, which &s;eems to have been brought in under the Pre|tence that the <HI>Arians</HI> us'd it in the very &s;ame Sen&s;e of the Son, and of all the Inferior Creatures; (tho' the <HI>Arians</HI> &s;o call'd by me, if not <HI>Arius</HI> and his peculiar Followers al&s;o, ever deny'd it) it was mo&s;t certainly the Ancient and Original Language of the Scripture, and of the fir&s;t Chri&s;ti|ans, and &s;o out of the Power of any Council what&s;oever, to abrogate or condemn: any more than they had Power to con&s;ecrate that novel and un&s;criptural Expre&s;&s;ion of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which had been &s;o expre&s;ly rejected by the Council of <HI>Antioch</HI> long before. So that, in &s;hort, the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, and <HI>Arius</HI> with his peculiar Followers, were both high|ly to blame in the&s;e Matters; and ought neither of them to be followed, without better Authority, by any Chri&s;tian.</NOTE> the <HI>Here&s;y of Arius</HI>, and of his peculiar Followers, as it was

I guarded again&s;t this expre&s;sly in my <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI>, p. 2. by a particular Declaration, that by that <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI> which I &s;peak of, I ever mean the Doctrine of that Part of the Church which was call'd <HI>Arian</HI> in the Fourth Century; and not the Doctrine of <HI>Arius</HI> him&s;elf only, with a few of his particular Followers. And this Di|&s;tinction is &s;o plain in all my Papers, that where|as I every where own the Doctrines of that Part of the Church in the Fourth Century, which their Adver&s;aries would call by the odious Name of <HI>Arian</HI>, yet do not I in any Propo|&s;ition a&s;&s;ert tho&s;e Particular Novel Doctrines, or u&s;e the like Particular Novel Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Arius</HI> him&s;elf, which were condemn'd at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>; but ever confine my &s;elf to the much Ancienter and more Authentick Do|ctrines and Language of the Scripture and the mo&s;t Primitive Writers. And I take leave to ob&s;erve here a few Things farther; That the main Body of tho&s;e whom their Adver&s;aries

call'd <HI>Arians</HI> in the Fourth Century, were them|&s;elves &s;o far from ju&s;tifying any of tho&s;e Ra&s;h and Novel A&s;&s;ertions and Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Arius</HI>, which caus'd the Di&s;turbances in the Church at that time, and were condemn'd by the Coun|cil of <HI>Nice</HI>, that they did not approve of them, or in&s;ert them into their Creeds; nay, did not them&s;elves publickly admit <HI>Arius</HI> and his Follow|ers into the Church again, till he gave in a Creed without the lea&s;t Syllable of them; as is evident in the Hi&s;tory of that Age. In reality, I think no one ought to be at all led by any particular Men, but to take their Chri&s;tian Faith and Practice from tho&s;e mo&s;t Sacred and Primitive Writers, which liv'd long before the Ri&s;e of the Controver&s;ies in the Fourth Cen|tury; as I have endeavour'd to do in my <HI>Account of the Primitive Faith</HI> of Chri&s;tians. I take this Opportunity al&s;o to beg of your Grace, if you &s;hall think fit, to recommend the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of my Papers to the Convocation, or to a Committee of Learned Men this Summer; that &s;o all may proceed with that Fairne&s;s, and &s;incere Regard to Truth and Chri&s;tianity, which becomes the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. If once this Matter be brought to that Method of Proceeding, I &s;hall exceed|ingly rejoice, and be ready, whenever I &s;hall be requir'd, to lay all my Papers before them for their Con&s;ideration; and to correct any Mi|&s;takes in them, or retract any Opinions I have advanc'd, that upon due Examination &s;hall ap|pear not to be well grounded.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Right Reverend Brethren,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHereas your Lord&s;hips, on the 19th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, came to &s;ome Re&s;olutions concerning a Book lately publi&s;h'd by Mr. <HI>Whi|&s;ton</HI>, and in Pur&s;uance thereof did agree at the &s;ame time that they &s;hould be laid before me, for my Opinion thereupon: I have already &s;ignified unto you, that I entirely agree with you in your Re&s;olution, that Notice &s;hould be taken of the &s;aid Book; and after having con&s;ulted &s;uch Books and Per&s;ons as I thought proper on this Occa&s;ion, I do now &s;ubjoin and offer my Opinion concerning the further Me|thods of Proceeding therein, as follows.</P>
<P>To proceed regularly in the Cen&s;ure of Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>, Two Points are to be con&s;ider'd:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Cen&s;ure of the Book, or Doctrine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Cen&s;ure of the Per&s;on.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. In order to a Cen&s;ure upon the Book or Doctrine, Two Things &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to be done. Fir&s;t, To have the Book well examin'd, and to fix upon the Particular Pa&s;&s;ages wherein he has a&s;&s;erted his Pernicious Tenets mo&s;t plain|ly and expre&s;sly. Secondly, To fix the Parti|cular Places of Scripture, and in the Council
<PB N="16" REF="17">
of <HI>Nice</HI>, and the Articles of our own Church, upon which the Charge of Here&s;y may be mo&s;t clearly grounded.</P>
<P N="2">2. In order to a Cen&s;ure of the Per&s;on in a Judicial way, there are Three &s;everal Methods which you will weigh and con&s;ider well, in or|der to judge how far each of them will be &s;afe and expedient, and how far effectual.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Fir&s;t Method is by Court of Con|vocation, in which &s;uch a Judicature hath been evidently exerci&s;ed in many In&s;tances, both before and &s;ince the Reformation, and &s;eems to be the mo&s;t de&s;irable Method in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, if the following Difficulties do not &s;tand in the way. Fir&s;t, Such a Court being final, or the La&s;t Re&s;ort, from which no Appeal is provided by the Stat. 25. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. Cap. 19. it may &s;eem to be doubtful, how far a Pro&s;ecution without Appeal to the Crown, will be con&s;i|&s;tent with 1. <HI>Eliz.</HI> Cap. 1. Sect. 17. whereby all Juri&s;diction, and particularly <HI>for Reformation of Errors, and Here&s;y, and Schi&s;ms, is united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm</HI>; and al&s;o, how far it will be con&s;i&s;tent with the Sta|tute of Appeals, 25. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. Cap. 19. which in the Cour&s;e of the Appeals directed to be thence|forth made, doth not mention Convocation.</P>
<P>Secondly, It &s;eems to be another Difficulty, that there does not appear to have been any Exerci&s;e of &s;uch a Judicature for this la&s;t 100 Years, or thereabout; in which time. Matters of this Nature were u&s;ually con&s;ider'd and ad|judg'd in the High-Commi&s;&s;ion-Court, whil&s;t that remained; and when that Court was &s;up|pre&s;s'd, it was enacted 17. <HI>Car.</HI> 2. Cap. 2. That no Court &s;hould be thenceforth erected with like <HI>Power, Juri&s;diction or Authority</HI>; but that all
<PB N="17" REF="18">
Commi&s;&s;ions erecting any &s;uch Courts, &s;hould be void.</P>
<P>You will therefore think it fit to be duly con|&s;ider'd, how far the Revival of this Judicial Authority in a Convocation, empower'd to proceed and act by Her Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion or Licen&s;e, may be con&s;trued an Erecting of a Court with <HI>like Power</HI> as the High-Commi&s;&s;i|on had.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Since the Di&s;u&s;e of &s;uch Judicial Proceeding, the Writ <HI>de Heretico comburendo</HI> has been taken away by the Statute of 29. <HI>Car.</HI> 2. Cap. 9. And you will al&s;o con&s;ider whether the Provi&s;ion there made for the <HI>Juri&s;diction of Pro|te&s;tant Archbi&s;hops or Bi&s;hops, or any other Judges of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, in Ca&s;es of Athei&s;m, Bla&s;phemy, Here&s;y and Schi&s;m</HI>, extend to Convocation, or only the ordinary E&s;tabli&s;h'd Court of every Archbi&s;hop or Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Fourthly, In the Year 1689, &s;everal Hereti|cal Books having been complain'd of to the Lower-Hou&s;e; the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> Pre&s;ident, and the then Bi&s;hops, after mature Advice and Deliberation thereupon, returned this An&s;wer, <HI>Se&s;&s;.</HI> 13. <HI>Quod con&s;cii &s;unt diver&s;as e&s;&s;e clau&s;ulas pernicio&s;as in libris allatis penes eos, &amp; directione dictae Domus relictis: &s;ed informati &s;unt per Juri&s;peritos utriu&s;&abque; juris proprias e&s;&s;e Curias Judiciales pro puniti|one delictorum huju&s;modi, &amp; eorum ferunt Opiniones non e&s;&s;e conveniens in pre&s;entia &s;e&s;e his rebus im|mi&s;cere.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The Second Method of Proceeding in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, as I humbly conceive, is for the Archbi&s;hop to hold a Court of Audience; and Calling to him his Provincial Bi&s;hops as A&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors there, to examine, proceed, and give Sentence as in his Court of Audience: Into
<PB N="18" REF="19">
which Court he is fully empower'd by a Spe|cial Provi&s;o, 23. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. Cap. 9. Sect. 3. to cite any Per&s;on out of his Dioce&s;e wherein he dwells, in ca&s;e that the Bi&s;hop, or other imme|diate Judge or Ordinary, dare not, or will not convene the Party to be &s;ued before him; and from which Court (as within the Statute of 25. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. Cap. 19.) a Regular Appeal lies to the Queen's Delegates in <HI>Chancery</HI>.</P>
<P N="3">III<HI>ly.</HI> The Bi&s;hop, in who&s;e Dioce&s;e he inhabits, may of his own accord cite him in his Court, or the Cau&s;e may be remitted, or &s;pecially re|commended to him as his proper Ordinary by the Archbi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops in Convocation; which we find hath oftentimes been done in Ca&s;es of the like Nature.</P>
<P>Of the Three foremention'd Methods the two la&s;t &s;eem to be mo&s;t plain and clear in Point of Legality. But becau&s;e the fir&s;t is the mo&s;t &s;olemn, provided it may be pur&s;ued legally, and with &s;afety to the Archbi&s;hop, Bi&s;hops, and Cler|gy of the Province, it &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary to lay the Premi&s;es, or what el&s;e may be the Re|&s;ult of your own Debates and Deliberations, be|fore her Maje&s;ty, with an humble Reque&s;t, as from the Upper Hou&s;e, that Her Maje&s;ty will be graciou&s;ly pleas'd to lay the Ca&s;e before Her Reverend Judges, for their Opinions there|upon.</P>

<PB N="23" REF="24">
and 25th Years of the &s;ame Reign touching Ap|peals, and as the Law now &s;tands, the Convo|cation hath not any Juri&s;diction originally to cite before them any Per&s;on for Here&s;y, or any o|ther Spiritual Offence, which according to the Laws of the Realm may be cited, cen&s;ured, and puni&s;hed in the re&s;pective Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts or Juri&s;dictions of the Archbi&s;hops, Bi|&s;hops, and other Ordinaries; who, we conceive, have the proper Judicature in tho&s;e Ca&s;es; and from whom and who&s;e Courts the Parties accu|&s;ed may have their Appeals; the la&s;t Re&s;ort wherein is lodg'd in the Crown. In which Sta|tute for Citing out of the Dioce&s;e, and in the others, as far as relates to Appeals for &s;uch Of|fences, no Notice is taken of the Convocation, either as to Juri&s;diction or Appeals. Nor doth it any way appear to us in whom the pretended judiciary Power of a Convocation either before or &s;ince the &s;aid Statutes, (if any &s;uch they ever had,) re&s;ided; whether in the whole Body of the Convocation, or in Part. But it is plain by the fir&s;t Statute, That the Archbi&s;hop's Juri&s;di|ction, even in Ca&s;e of Here&s;y, is bounded &s;o that he cannot proceed again&s;t &s;uch Offenders within any other Dioce&s;e than his own, without the Con&s;ent, or in the Default of the Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops. All which Statutes being made for the Ea&s;e and Benefit of the Subjects, they cannot, as we humbly conceive, be deprived of the Be|nefit of them by any pretence of Juri&s;diction in the Convocation; from which we cannot find or be inform'd of any In&s;tance of Appeal. Nor have any Judicial Precedents or Authorities for Convening or Cen&s;uring of &s;uch Offenders in any Convocation &s;ince tho&s;e Statutes, or the Re|formation (which is now near 180 Years) ap|pear'd unto us. And if &s;uch Power &s;hould be
<PB N="24" REF="25">
allow'd to the Convocation, we conceive it would invade the ordinary Juri&s;diction of the Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops; which we conceive are pre&s;erved by the Act of Parliament made in the 17th Year of the Reign of his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. and by another made in the 13th Year of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se|cond, <HI>Chap.</HI> 12. and by the Act made the 29th <HI>Car.</HI> 2<HI>di.</HI> Chap. 9. which took away the Writ <HI>De Heretico Comburendo</HI>; in none of which any mention is made of the Convocation. And by the <HI>Bill of Rights</HI>, 1.

But we con|ceive that Heretical Tenets and Opinions may be examin'd and condemn'd in Convocation, authoriz'd by Royal Licen&s;e, without convening the Authors or Maintainers of them. All which we mo&s;t humbly &s;ubmit to Your Royal Maje&s;ty's Great Wi&s;dom.</P>

<P>UPon Con&s;ideration of the Humble Addre&s;s deliver'd to Us from You, and from the re&s;t of the Bi&s;hops of your Province in Convo|cation A&s;&s;embled, We have con&s;ulted Our Judges, Our Attorney and Sollicitor-General, how far the Convocation, as the Law now &s;tands, may proceed in Examining, Cen&s;uring,

<P>We are plea&s;ed to find that, according to the Opinion of Eight of Our Twelve Judges, and of Our Attorney and Sollicitor-General, as the Law now &s;tands, a Juri&s;diction in Matter of He|re&s;y, and Condemnation of Hereticks, is pro|per to be exercis'd in Convocation; and We cannot doubt but the Convocation may now be &s;atisfied they may employ the Power which belongs to them, in repre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Impious At|tempts, lately made to &s;ubvert the Foundation of the Chri&s;tian Faith</HI>; which was one of the chief Ends we propo&s;ed to our &s;elves in a&s;&s;embling them, as appears from the whole of our Letter, of <HI>December</HI> 12th, and from the fir&s;t Head of Bu&s;ine&s;s, which in our two Sub&s;equent Let|ters of <HI>January</HI> 29th, and <HI>February</HI> 14th, we re|commended to their Con&s;ideration.

<P><PB N="28" REF="29" MS="Y">Accordingly, This Letter was communica|ted to both Hou&s;es, on <HI>Friday May</HI> 11. together with the Opinions of the Judges. The &s;ame Day a Committee of both Hou&s;es was named to compare my Doctrines with tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>England</HI>: The Bi&s;hops of <HI>Norwich</HI>, and St. <HI>David</HI>'s, being named in the Upper; and the Prolocutor, Dean <HI>Kennet</HI>, Dr. <HI>Smalridge</HI>, Dr. <HI>Ed|wards</HI>, and Dr. <HI>Gib&s;on</HI> in the Lower.

<P>Now the Reader is to note, that I have never been able to procure a Copy of that Report of the Committee before-mentioned, as it was fir&s;t brought in, with its Texts of Scripture, and Citations from the two fir&s;t general Councils, and from the publick Acts of the Church of <HI>En|gland</HI>. For tho&s;e Texts and Citations were all dropt afterward in the Lower Hou&s;e, and that Omi&s;&s;ion comply'd with by the Upper; this made the la&s;t Re&s;ult appear in a very different Form from the fir&s;t Draught. After &s;ome time had pa&s;t &s;ince the before-mention'd Letter was delivered, I heard nothing about its being &s;ent to the Convocation; nay I &s;oon heard that it was mo&s;t certainly not &s;ent; and that it was well known the Convocation did not intend to hear me at all. I re&s;olved to try once more to be heard, by writing a more free and bold Let|ter to each Hou&s;e of Convocation, to claim that common Right of Mankind. This la&s;t Letter was directed thus, for the Upper Hou&s;e, <HI>To the Archbi&s;hop's Sub&s;titute</HI>: And, with a very few nece&s;&s;ary Alterations of Stile, for the Lower, <HI>To the Prolocutor</HI>; and was in the&s;e Words.</P>

<P>UNder&s;tanding that there are &s;ome Propo|&s;itions extracted out of my Books, in or|der to their being cen&s;ur'd by the Convocation as Heretical, I cannot but make this Addre&s;s to your Lord&s;hip, as the Sub&s;titute of the Pre&s;i|dent in his Ab&s;ence; and thereby to the Upper Hou&s;e of Convocation, to beg the Favour of a true Copy of tho&s;e Propo&s;itions, and &s;ome &s;mall time to make my Explication and Apology in relation to them.

<P><PB N="31" REF="32">This Letter I &s;ent by Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI>, as a faithful Friend, and as a Per&s;on not generally known by Face to the Members of Convocation; tho' one that had undergone a &s;evere Fine and Im|pri&s;onment in <HI>Ireland</HI>, for much the &s;ame Cau&s;e that this Per&s;ecution has been rais'd again&s;t me in <HI>England</HI>, and on that Account very dear to me. Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI> could not get the Vergers to carry in that Copy which was for the Upper Hou&s;e; and &s;o I was forced to &s;end it afterward another way. But meeting with the Prolocu|tor in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abby</HI>, walking with Dr. <HI>Ga&s;trel</HI>, he delivered the other Copy to him, intending to be unknown, and to appear as a bare Me&s;|&s;enger: But was forc'd by the Importunity of the Prolocutor, and the Knowledge or Gue&s;s of Dr. <HI>Ga&s;trel</HI> to di&s;cover him&s;elf to them. This cau&s;ed a current Report, that I a&s;&s;ociated my &s;elf with a <HI>Socinian Di&s;&s;enter, who &s;till kept a</HI> Socinian <HI>Meeting</HI>.</P>
<P>Which Character of Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Reply to Dr. <HI>Alli$</HI>, p. 42.</NOTE> I take to be directly fal&s;e: As I have el&s;ewhere intima|ted: And I do here venture to recommend his judicious Book Intituled, <HI>An Humble Enquiry into the Scripture Account of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>, for which he &s;uffered that hard Pro&s;ecution in <HI>Ireland</HI> be|fore-mentioned, to the Chri&s;tian Reader; and am bold to &s;ay, that if I could but &s;ee that &s;mall Treati&s;e &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered, it would do more to convince me of my being mi&s;taken, than all that has been yet &s;aid or done relating there|to. That Book was indeed reply'd to by Mr. <HI>Boy&s;e</HI>: But upon Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI>'s Vindication of the Principal Point in it, the Di&s;pute was prudently dropt by the other, and no farther Rejoinder made to it. And, by the way, that the Hone&s;t Rea|der may &s;ee who Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI> is, and for what he was condemn'd in <HI>Ireland</HI>, I will pre&s;ent him with
<PB N="32" REF="33" MS="Y">
an entire and authentick Copy of the Words charg'd upon him in his Indictment, as they were extracted out of his before-mention'd Trea|ti&s;e:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 4.</NOTE>
<Q>&startq;I &s;ee no Rea&s;on, &s;ays, he, there will be to oppo&s;e tho&s;e <HI>Unitarians</HI> who think Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be a &s;ufficient Saviour and a Prince, though he be not the only Supreme God. Nor can any with Rea&s;on attempt to prove him to be &s;uch from his Works and Office as King of his Church; &s;ince 'tis imply'd, that as &s;uch he mu&s;t do Homage to God the Father, in de|livering up his Kingdom to him. And this very Expre&s;&s;ion, (to God the Father,) makes it plain that there is no God the Son in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, or in the &s;ame Supreme E&s;&s;ence with the Father. &mdash; So then Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his highe&s;t Capacity is Inferior to the Father. How can he be the &s;ame God to which he is &s;ubject, or of the &s;ame Rank and Dignity? &mdash; So that I may &s;afely &s;ay thus much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 9.</NOTE> That the Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us has declar'd him&s;elf not to be the Supreme God, or equal to the Father, as plainly as Words could &s;peak, or in brief &endq;Expre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>This Doctrine of Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI> is far enough from <HI>Sociniani&s;m</HI>, and is indeed little different from that which Bi&s;hop <HI>Bull</HI>, and with him our pre|&s;ent Convocation it &s;elf begin freely to a&s;&s;ert. Yet was this but Eight Years ago e&s;teem'd &s;o horrid in <HI>Ireland</HI>, that for a&s;&s;erting it poor Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI>, after Two Indictments drawn up which would not bear, was the third time found Guilty of no le&s;s a Crime than <HI>Bla&s;phemy</HI>; and this by a Jury of Trade&s;men; but at the Dire|ction of a Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, and by the Ter|ror infus'd from the Pre&s;ence and Zeal of Two Archbi&s;hops upon the Bench, and of &s;everal Bi&s;hops in the Court; whereof they were re|minded
<PB N="33" REF="34">
by the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice. Nor was the Sentence and Puni&s;hment &s;mall; but pro|portion'd to &s;o heinous a Crime, &s;o far as the Law would warrant; I mean a Fine of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> with Impri&s;onment till it was paid. Part of the Fine, indeed, was afterward remitted; but not till after more than Two Years Impri&s;onment. Which Puni&s;hment, together with the publick Odium and Infamy, and the lo&s;s of an 100 <HI>l.</HI> a Year Income be&s;ides, he has born with Chri&s;ti|an Patience hitherto. Yet after all this, while his la&s;t Book remains unan&s;wer'd, and not one proper Part of the <HI>Socinian</HI> Doctrine can be charg'd upon him; while he has long left off keeping any Di&s;&s;enting Meeting; nay, has ge|nerally communicated with our Church, &s;o far as in Con&s;cience he can; he is to be a-new Re|proach'd and Stigmatiz'd, becau&s;e at my De&s;ire he carried a Letter for me to the Prolocutor of the Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation, and intend|ed not to have appear'd any otherwi&s;e than as an unknown and namele&s;s Me&s;&s;enger upon that Occa&s;ion. Were not all this plain Fact, one would think it impo&s;&s;ible for Men of any Cha|racter or Figure to behave them&s;elves &s;o partial|ly, unju&s;tly, and unchri&s;tianly, as &s;uch a Pro|cedure implies. And I hope the Body of this Nation are too free, and too aver&s;e from Per&s;e|cution for Con&s;cience &s;ake, to encourage any Man or Number of Men what&s;oever in Matters &s;o utterly unju&s;tifyable and unrea&s;onable. But to return.</P>
<P>When the Propo&s;itions came from the Upper Hou&s;e to the Lower; neither of which vouch|&s;afed to hear me, nor &s;o much as &s;ent me a Co|py of what they were going to Cen&s;ure, it prov'd to be thus: That Propo&s;ition from the Upper Hou&s;e, which condemn'd as Here&s;y my
<PB N="34" REF="35" MS="Y">
Affirming, that <HI>the One God of the Chri&s;tians was not the Three Per&s;ons taken together, but God the Fa|ther only</HI>, was generally yielded to be Heretical: Though more than one of the Lower Hou&s;e own'd it was not &s;o: And one of them entred his Prote&s;tation accordingly, that he did not condemn it as &s;uch. That Propo&s;ition, or Part of a Propo&s;ition al&s;o which, as it came from the Upper Hou&s;e, noted my affirming the Son to be <HI>Subordinate</HI> to the Father, as Heretical; upon De|liberation in the Lower, was own'd not to be &s;o; but to be the true Chri&s;tian Doctrine; and accordingly it was amended or omitted by the Lower Hou&s;e; and at la&s;t the Upper Hou&s;e agreed to &s;uch an Amendment or Omi&s;&s;ion. And other &s;uch Alterations or Omi&s;&s;ions I have heard were made there al&s;o; though I have had &s;o very imperfect Hints about them, that I can give no very good Account of them. Howe|ver, the &s;everal A&s;&s;ertions of mine which were condemn'd as Heretical, were Twelve; be&s;ides a Thirteenth about the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions, as if what I affirmed of them were, tho not He|retical, yet Impious, and &s;uch as tended to di|&s;turb the Canon of Scripture. But &s;o privately has this Matter been carried, and the&s;e Cen&s;ures are &s;o far from being made publick, as one would think their very Nature and De&s;ign requir'd them to be, that I my &s;elf have only heard them read over, but have not been able to procure a Copy of them. I hope the Members begin to be &s;en&s;ible of their Error in this way of Pro|ceeding, and are therefore willing to conceal the Effects thereof from the World: Which if it be &s;o, I own there is good Rea&s;on for Con|cealment: otherwi&s;e I and all the Church have a Right to be informed of the&s;e Matters, and ought to have a Copy of this Cen&s;ure authen|tickly
<PB N="35" REF="36" MS="Y">
communicated to us. But to &s;ay no more upon that Head, I &s;hall venture to leave the&s;e pretended Heretical Propo&s;itions of mine to be confuted by the Learned, when my Four Vo|lumes are publi&s;hed; as well as they have been thus before-hand cen&s;ur'd, without Examination, by the Convocation. I only Remark here the&s;e Two Things, (1.) That the Convocation has not, I perceive, thought fit to cen&s;ure my 20th Propo&s;ition, where my Doctrine was mo&s;t au|thentickly explain'd, concerning the Divinity and Invocation of the Holy Gho&s;t, but only an occa&s;ional Pa&s;&s;age in one of my Letters to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: So that the Sen&s;e of the Convo|cation &s;eems to be this, That although it be un|deniable that the Scriptures, or the mo&s;t primitive Writers never ventur'd to call the Holy Gho&s;t God, or Lord, nor to Invocate him, yet is it Here&s;y now to in&s;inuate that he is not to be &s;o called, nor to be &s;o invocated by Chri&s;tians. Which &s;ort of Determination I cannot but re|commend to the hone&s;t reformed Chri&s;tian's &s;e|rious Con&s;ideration. I do remark (2.) That over and above the other Mi&s;takes or Mi&s;inter|pretations of my Meaning, the Convocation have, at the Conclu&s;ion of its Cen&s;ure, a&s;&s;erted an eminent Matter of Fact which is untrue; nay, when the very Foundation of the Cen&s;ure is built on that Fact &s;o untruly repre&s;ented, as I have el&s;ewhere noted already.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Reply to Dr. <HI>Allix</HI>, p. 24.</NOTE> For I am there|fore cen&s;ured for affirming the Con&s;titutions to be a <HI>Canonical Book</HI>, becau&s;e they &s;ay no General Council ever own'd them as &s;uch. Whereas the $act is, that every General Council, till very late Ages, tho&s;e I mean which &s;peak of the Ca|nonical Books at all, do con&s;tantly own them for undoubtedly <HI>Canonical</HI>; as will at large ap|pear in my <HI>E&s;&s;ay on tho&s;e Con&s;titutions</HI>. This gro&s;s
<PB N="36" REF="37">
Mi&s;take makes it very evident, that tho&s;e who drew up this Cen&s;ure, were not &s;ufficiently careful to under&s;tand the Hi&s;tory of the&s;e Con&s;titutions, nor indeed of tho&s;e General Councils them&s;elves, on who&s;e Authority they rely'd in rejecting them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now add that Speech, that Explicati|on, Defence and Appeal, which I intended to have made <HI>viva voce</HI> before both Hou&s;es of Convocation, had I been permitted &s;o to do. For tho' I could not obtain the Favour of be|ing <HI>heard</HI> by the Convocation, yet do I hope I may obtain that of being <HI>read</HI>, both by them and others, upon &s;o great an Occa&s;ion.

For I find my &s;elf under the Accu&s;ation of Here&s;y; and that not only from a &s;ingle Per&s;on, but from the principal Part of the Re|pre&s;entative Body of the Church whereof I am a Member.

So that I, who fully

believe the&s;e Sacred Texts, and expect to be judg'd according to them, ought certainly to be very careful that I be not guilty of that great and fatal Crime of <HI>Here&s;y</HI>, whereof I am ac|cus'd.</P>
<P>But then, on the other &s;ide, &s;eeing the Crime is &s;o heinous, and the Puni&s;hment &s;o great, particular Care ought to be taken, that none be accus'd of it, without a through Examina|tion, and full Proof; That the Word <HI>Here&s;y</HI>, be now taken in the &s;ame Accptation that St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> us'd it in; and that nothing be e&s;teem'd &s;uch, but upon Sacred and Divine Authority: Nothing, but what is plainly con|trary to the clear Te&s;timony of In&s;pired Wri|tings: Otherwi&s;e it may mo&s;t ea&s;ily happen, that the Mi&s;takes of Men &s;hall pa&s;s for the Truths of God, and the Holy Doctrines of our Reli|gion be e&s;teem'd direct Here&s;ies. That this is no impo&s;&s;ible Suppo&s;ition, I believe you will all grant; as knowing that every one of you your &s;elves, who &s;eem willing to lay this Imputation upon me, are e&s;teem'd <HI>Hereticks</HI> by the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>; And that the&s;e Reformed Kingdoms pa&s;s with a great Part of the Chri&s;tian World, only as the Principal Branch of the <HI>Northern Here&s;y</HI>.

This is the plain Truth of my Ca&s;e. And if any of this Great Body will plea&s;e to go through the &s;ame Cour&s;e of Study, with the &s;ame free and unbya&s;s'd Temper of Mind, and an equal De&s;ire of Primitive Truth, on what Side &s;oever it is found; and will then &s;peak and write his Mind as freely as I have done; I believe he will be in great danger of this Imputation al&s;o. All that I beg therefore is this; That you, who are willing to be Judges, will but &s;pend Part at lea&s;t of that Time and Pains which I took be|fore I fix'd my Opinions, in the &s;erious Exami|nation of them before you proceed again&s;t me.</P>
<P>In Civil Courts, the Judges always &s;atisfy them&s;elves of the Law, before they determine the Ca&s;e. Accordingly, &s;ince the Sacred Books of our Religion are, even by the Direction of the Act of Parliament relating to this Matter, the fir&s;t and principal of your Legal Guides; as well as by the Nature of our Religion, both as Chri&s;tian and as Reformed, your proper Guides in Con&s;cience; I have Rea&s;on to ex|pect, that you &s;earch and examine the &s;ame, before you pa&s;s any Cen&s;ure upon me. Con&s;i|der what An&s;wer you will make to our Lord at the Great Day of Judgment, in ca&s;e you be mi&s;taken, and condemn his Holy and Divine Truths for <HI>Bla&s;phemous</HI> and <HI>Damnable</HI> Here&s;ies? And this merely, becau&s;e you would not &s;earch the Scriptures, nor fairly examine the Doctrines, whether they were his Truths, or not. Con&s;i|der that in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, even tho' you &s;hould happen not to be mi&s;taken, but the Opinions condemned &s;hould really prove Fal&s;e and Here|tical at la&s;t; yet that the Condemning the &s;ame without a through Examination, will be &s;carce a le&s;s Crime in this than in the for|mer

Ca&s;e: Since there is no Examination &s;up|pos'd, whether the Doctrines were truly Here|&s;ies or not; but they are condemn'd while it was not known but they might prove to be the Certain Truths of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. And indeed, what has been already done, I mean the Ad|dre&s;s, or Repre&s;entation of my Opinions to the Queen's mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty as <HI>damnable</HI> and <HI>bla&s;phemous A&s;&s;ertions</HI>; and of me, as one of <HI>pernicious De&s;igns</HI>, as guilty of <HI>direct Bla&s;phemy</HI>, and <HI>contradicting Fundamental Articles</HI> of Chri&s;tia|nity; and this before any Enquiry or Exami|nation; would afford me very great and very ju&s;t Occa&s;ion of Complaint, did not the Sacredne&s;s of the Character of the College of Bi&s;hops, under who&s;e Name that Addre&s;s appears, whom all Chri|&s;tians are to have in the highe&s;t Veneration; and who&s;e Authority, when duly exercis'd, Chri&s;t (by his Apo&s;tles, in their Con&s;titutions) has declar'd to be &s;o indi&s;putable and divine, mightily re&s;train me; and per&s;wade me ra|ther to <HI>lay my hand upon my mouth</HI> for the pre&s;ent, and &s;it down contented under tho&s;e reproachful Characters. However, the good Providence of God will, I hope, afford me in due time &s;ome other more inoffen&s;ive Means of Recovering my Reputation with the Great Defender of our Faith, and Fountain of Ju&s;tice; before whom I have been &s;o hardly repre&s;ented; that I may, if po&s;&s;ible, regain Her Maje&s;ty's good Opinion, without the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of my <HI>&s;peaking evil</HI> of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Rulers of</HI> Chri&s;tian <HI>People</HI>. Only this, I hope, I may have Leave here to &s;ay without Offence; That there can certainly be no Cau&s;e to place me among <HI>Bla&s;phemers</HI>; nor to &s;uppo&s;e me capable of concurring with any <HI>impious Attempts to &s;ubvert the Foundation of the Chri|&s;tian Faith</HI>: Unle&s;s it be <HI>Bla&s;phemy</HI> to prefer what,

upon the fulle&s;t Evidence, I do really believe to be the Sacred Truths of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour concerning the Supreme God, and him&s;elf his Only-begotten Son, and that Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit who is derived from them both; before the late De|crees and Determinations which Human Au|thority has impos'd upon the Church in tho&s;e Matters; And unle&s;s the writing zealou&s;ly for, and by both my Labours, Doctrine and Life, heartily endeavouring to promote the Chri&s;tian Religion, and to &s;pread it over the World, can be interpreted <HI>Subverting the Foundations of it</HI>. E&s;pecially &s;uch Imputations are with le&s;s Rea&s;on laid upon me at this time, when I am upon &s;uch a Great De&s;ign of Recovering the Original Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, and Re&s;toring the Purity of its Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline among Men: And do verily hope and believe, that the entire additional Evidence for the certain Truth of the Go&s;pel I bring with me; <HI>That</HI> which will ari&s;e from a right Under&s;tanding of it, and the Vani&s;hing of tho&s;e pre&s;&s;ing Objecti|ons which have ari&s;en from our modern Mi|&s;takes about it; and <HI>That</HI> which I have to pro|po&s;e anew from that Ine&s;timable and mo&s;t Sa|cred Book of our Religion, the <HI>Con&s;titutions of the Apo&s;tles</HI>, will &s;carcely be inferior to tho&s;e &s;trong and convincing Proofs we have for it al|ready; and &s;o will, I hope, render all the Ef|forts of Athei&s;m and Infidelity, of which there are &s;uch great and &s;uch ju&s;t Complaints among us, for the future perfectly ineffectual. How|ever, my Comfort under &s;o great Reproaches and Accu&s;ations is this, That the be&s;t and fir&s;t Confe&s;&s;ors and Martyrs for our Holy Religion, nay, the Ble&s;&s;ed Author of it him&s;elf, and his Apo&s;tles, could not e&s;cape the like odious Im|putations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts III. 11, 13.</NOTE> St. <HI>Stephen</HI> being accus'd and con|demn'd

<P>I pa&s;s over the har&s;h Interpretation of my Dedication of the <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI> to the Con|vocation; as if it were a Piece of <HI>Confidence</HI> in me, or an Affront offer'd to them; which was &s;incerely intended as a real In&s;tance of Re&s;pect and Deference to the Convocation, and to the Church of <HI>England</HI>. But then, as to the Do|ctrines them&s;elves which I have advanced, I am &s;o well a&s;&s;ur'd of their certain Truth, and of the Strength of the Evidence that I have for them, that I do here again publickly offer to this Convocation, as I have &s;o often done it in other places, that if I be allow'd a fair Hearing, or Conference, or Examination, and the con|trary plain Te&s;timonies in the earlie&s;t Antiqui|ty appear to be one Tenth Part &s;o many in Number, and &s;o weighty as I have to produce for my A&s;&s;ertions, I will entirely &s;uppre&s;s my Papers, and they &s;hall give no farther Di&s;tur|bance to the Chri&s;tian World. I have made this Offer &s;o often in vain el&s;ewhere, that I cannot fully promi&s;e my &s;elf better Succe&s;s here. All therefore that in ca&s;e of Refu&s;al I can farther de&s;ire upon this Head, which in|deed I fully in&s;i&s;t upon, is only this; That till &s;o fair and unexceptionable an Offer be ac|cepted, and its Succe&s;s known, I may not be condemned as an <HI>Heretick</HI>, nor my A&s;&s;ertions pronounc'd to be <HI>Heretical</HI>; le&s;t the free and un|bya&s;s'd Part of Mankind entertain a too di&s;ad|vantagious
<PB N="43" REF="44" MS="Y">
Opinion of the Proceedings of this Convocation, and of that Clergy whom it re|pre&s;ents: As indeed, I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;ay it, not a few of them do already begin to do upon this Occa&s;ion. Permit me farther to &s;ay, that the &s;tiling tho&s;e Doctrines <HI>Heretical</HI>, which are by all the Learned own'd to be plainly con|tain'd in the Con&s;titutions of the Apo&s;tles, and the Larger Epi&s;tles of <HI>Ignatius</HI>, without the lea&s;t Examination of my Proofs for the Genuinene&s;s of tho&s;e Books, is certainly a mo&s;t &s;trange Pro|cedure, and &s;uch as cannot, I think, be recon|cil'd with the known Rules of Ju&s;tice, much le&s;s with Chri&s;tianity. All other bare Human Authorities, and Expre&s;&s;ions of the Ancient Fathers, may &s;ometimes be &s;et a&s;ide by preju|dic'd Men, without the Impeachment of their Chri&s;tianity; becau&s;e they may po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e that the Sacred Books of our Religion do deli|ver Things contrary to tho&s;e Notions. But to call Opinions <HI>Heretical</HI>, that are own'd to be contain'd not only in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s own Bi&s;hop <HI>Ignatius</HI>'s Larger Epi&s;tles, but in the mo&s;t Sacred Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions them&s;elves; while Men not only neglect, but refu&s;e to examine whether tho&s;e Books be genuine or not; &s;eems to me not at all con&s;i&s;tent with our common Chri&s;tianity. Be pleas'd therefore to appoint a fair Examination, at lea&s;t of the Papers which vindicate tho&s;e Books, before you venture to cen&s;ure the Doctrines contain'd in them. And that I may pre&s;s this Matter home upon you, I do here produce and offer to you my <HI>Di&s;&s;erta|tion upon the Epi&s;tles of</HI> Ignatius, which is not very long, and its Subject not too remote from the Studies of the pre&s;ent Age, for your imme|diate Examination accordingly. And I con|jure you by all the Ties of Sincerity and of

Con&s;cience, that at lea&s;t <HI>this one Part</HI> of my E|vidence for what I a&s;&s;ert, may be throughly examin'd, before any Cen&s;ure be pa&s;s'd upon my A&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>And this I do the more boldly plead for, be|cau&s;e, whatever Di&s;agreement there is in the Opinions of the Reverend the Judges, as to the Juri&s;diction of this Body in other Ca&s;es here|to relating, yet do they all unanimou&s;ly agree in this, That the fir&s;t Thing (without Di&s;pute) in the Power of the Convocation, is, the <HI>Exa|mination</HI> of &s;uch Opinions as are repre&s;ented to them as Heretical: Nor do they in the lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that they can cen&s;ure or condemn them, but upon &s;uch an <HI>Examination</HI>. And if &s;o fair and unexceptionable a Propo&s;al be re|fus'd, I mu&s;t appeal from you to God Almigh|ty, and to the whole Chri&s;tian World for my Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>But to come directly to the pre&s;ent Matter, namely, to that <HI>Accu&s;ation of Here&s;y</HI> which is laid again&s;t me, on Account of &s;ome of my Do|ctrines appearing to contradict, I do not &s;ay the Scriptures, for I am well a&s;&s;ured there is but &s;mall Pretence for any &s;uch Imagination, but the Determinations of the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, who&s;e Decrees are one Rule for judging of Here&s;y by the Laws of this Kingdom. Now I do humbly pre&s;ume that this Convocation cannot of it &s;elf alone determine what is <HI>Here&s;y</HI>, at lea&s;t in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e: Since that very Act which is the Principal Legal Guide in this Ca&s;e, expre&s;ly makes the Parliament a nece&s;&s;ary Part of &s;uch Authority: I &s;ay, in &s;uch Ca&s;es as mine at lea&s;t this Con&s;ent both of Parliament and Convoca|tion is nece&s;&s;ary to determine what is legal He|re&s;y; becau&s;e, as will appear pre&s;ently, of the &s;everal Legal Rules which are mention'd in that

Act, tho&s;e Two which are concern'd in my Mat|ters are expre&s;ly contrary to one another in the principal Point of all. For as to the Creed and Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, which are &s;uppos'd in the Ad|dre&s;s to Her Maje&s;ty to contradict my A&s;&s;erti|ons, e&s;pecially in two Points really fundamental to our Religion, I &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantiali|ty</HI> of our Saviour, and his being <HI>begotten ab aeter|n$</HI>, and not <HI>made</HI> or <HI>created</HI>; I mu&s;t declare that I have not &s;o far deny'd the Con&s;ub&s;tanti|ality of the Son, or &s;o far affirmed that our Saviour was <HI>made</HI> or <HI>created</HI> by the Father, in that Sen&s;e I mean wherein the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> intended chiefly to e&s;tabli&s;h the one, and con|demn the other, as is generally believ'd: Which my MSS. Papers will more fully &s;hew. And in|deed my MS. Account of the Primitive Faith does &s;o di&s;tinctly explain my real Sentiments in the&s;e and other Matters, and is &s;o perpetually re|fer'd to by the &s;maller and more imperfect Pa|pers already printed, that I cannot but vehe|mently complain of great Hard&s;hip and mo&s;t &s;evere Treatment whenever my Opinions are, pretended to be authentickly cen&s;ur'd or con|demn'd without the peru&s;al of tho&s;e Papers: E&s;pecially when you all cannot but know that not only the Convocation, or either Hou&s;e, or any Committee of either Hou&s;e, but every &s;ingle Member in particular may mo&s;t ea&s;ily command the u&s;e of the &s;ame Papers at their own Plea&s;ure, upon the lea&s;t Intimation of their De&s;ires to that Purpo&s;e. And as to the Term <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantial</HI>, any that read tho&s;e loo&s;e, uncertain, and improper Significations which were put upon that Word by that Council to the great <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>, when he &s;crupled the u&s;e of it; and that con&s;ider the Word it &s;elf is no where us'd in Scripture, much le&s;s applied to
<PB N="46" REF="47" MS="Y">
our Saviour there; that 'tis no where us'd by the anciente&s;t Catholicks; and that when it fir&s;t appear'd publickly, at the earlier and more va|luable Council of <HI>Antioch</HI>, it was expre&s;ly reject|ed, will be very tender how they interpret my unwillingne&s;s to u&s;e that Word in a Creed, or to own it for an Article of Faith, as a Sign of Heretical Pravity; and how they condemn me for an Heretick upon that Account. E&s;pe|cially when 'tis only the direct Affirmation that the Son is of <HI>another Sub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>another E&s;|&s;ence</HI> from the Father, which is anathematiz'd by that Council, as really Heretical: Which I am &s;ure I have no where done in any of my Papers. However, I cannot but here note al&s;o, how &s;trange the Term <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantial</HI>, or of <HI>the &s;ame Sub&s;tance</HI> with the Supreme God, would have appear'd to tho&s;e fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, who &s;uppos'd, that while all <HI>Sub&s;tances</HI> were derived from the Father, the very term <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> was quite be|neath the Dignity of his Nature, and that he was him&s;elf <HI>beyond all Sub&s;tance</HI> what&s;oever. But as to the u&s;e of the word <HI>create</HI>, with its Paral|lels, and their Derivatives, concerning the O|rigin of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, which is indeed directly anathematiz'd by this Council, as wel$ as denied in its Creed, and yet is, I freely own made u&s;e of by me upon all occa&s;ions: I mu&s;$ fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that it appears by &s;ome of the mo&s;$ authentick Records of this Matter now extan$ I mean <HI>Alexander</HI>'s Circular Letter to the Bi&s;hops and <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s own Letter to his Dioce&s;e from this Council; that the words <HI>Create</HI> and <HI>Make</HI> and the Derivative ones of <HI>Creature</HI> or <HI>Workman+&s;hip of God</HI>, were therefore rejected by it, becau&s;$ it &s;uppos'd that the Followers of <HI>Arius</HI> us'd ther$ in the very &s;ame Sen&s;e of the Son of God, an$ of the inferior Creatures: Which Suppo&s;ition$
<PB N="47" REF="48" MS="Y">
whether ju&s;t or not, did plainly give a Handle for the Council's Rejection or Condemnation of tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions at that time. So that the Sen&s;e wherein they were rejected is &s;uch as little concerns tho&s;e that I call <HI>Arians</HI>; nor among them does it much concern my &s;elf; who ex|pre&s;sly A&s;&s;ert, in my third Propo&s;ition, that <HI>Chri&s;t is in an extraordinary and &s;ingular manner deriv'd from the Supreme God the Father</HI>; as is al&s;o more largely explain'd in one of my MS. Notes upon that Article. And that the Council originally did not mean to deny that Chri&s;t was <HI>created</HI> by God, &s;eems plain, becau&s;e all the Church at that time, and <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> among the re&s;t, ever confe&s;s'd that the Scripture it &s;elf did affirm that He <HI>was created</HI> by him, in tho&s;e known Words of <HI>Solomon</HI>, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Which I think no Chri&s;tian ever deny'd to be rightly rendred, and to belong to our Saviour, till after the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>. And were I not apprehen&s;ive that &s;uch a long Train of Citations from the &s;acred and mo&s;t ancient Books of our Religion would &s;eem too tedious in this place, I could mo&s;t ea&s;ily &s;hew all along, not only that the <HI>Generation</HI> of our Saviour was own'd to be free and voluntary, which I take to mean the &s;ame with his <HI>Creation</HI>; but that he was &s;till mo&s;t expre&s;sly own'd to be <HI>created</HI> or <HI>made</HI> by, and to be the <HI>Creature</HI> or <HI>Workman&s;hip</HI> of the Father. I have above Twenty of tho&s;e Citations now by me, all ancienter than the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, ta|ken out of the <HI>Proverbs</HI> of <HI>Solomon, Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus</HI>, St. <HI>Paul</HI>, St. <HI>John</HI>, the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions, St. <HI>Hermas</HI>, St. <HI>Ignatius, Ju&s;tin Martyr, Athenago|ras, Tatian, Melito</HI>, the Recognitions, <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, Gregory</HI> of <HI>Neocae&s;a|rea, Cyprian, Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Alexandria, Theogno&s;tus, Methodius</HI>, and <HI>Lactantius</HI>. So that I cannot be
<PB N="48" REF="49">
condemn'd of Here&s;y for affirming that our Lord was <HI>created</HI>, unle&s;s at the &s;ame time every one of tho&s;e Sacred and Primitive Writers partake of the &s;ame Condemnation with me, and be pro|nounc'd <HI>Hereticks</HI> al&s;o. In &s;hort, Of the two Le|gal Rules for Here&s;y, the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, which our Church owns to be fallible, &s;ays our Saviour <HI>was not Created:</HI> And the Sacred Writers, even &s;ome of tho&s;e which our Church has in her very Canon, and owns to be infallible, &s;upported by all Antiquity al&s;o, &s;ays our Saviour <HI>was Created</HI>. Which of the&s;e contradictory Authorities mu&s;t the Church judge of Here&s;y by? the fallible Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, or the infallible Word of God? If by the Former, I own I may be condemn'd as an Heretick by Law, for venturing to follow the expre&s;s Words of Scripture, after they had been condemn'd by a General Council: But if by the Latter, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly be condemn'd at all, but mu&s;t be allow'd to be entirely innocent, and to have kept clo&s;e to Divine Revelation and Ex|pre&s;&s;ion in this matter. But now if after all it be &s;aid, that the Church does not except &s;o much again&s;t the <HI>Words</HI> as the <HI>Thing</HI>, and only expects that, in compliance with this fir&s;t General Coun|cil's Doctrine, I really own the proper <HI>Coeternity</HI>, the real <HI>Eternal Generation</HI>, or <HI>Eternal Creation</HI> of the Son of God, or el&s;e &s;ubmit to the Imputa|tion and Puni&s;hment of Legal Here&s;y: I An|&s;wer, That I have never yet been &s;o fortunate as to di&s;cover &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions, or &s;uch Doctrines, either before or at the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>. Nor do I find rea&s;on to believe that any Chri&s;tian &s;o early a&s;&s;erted &s;uch things, as Doctrines of his Religion; whatever Metaphy&s;ick or Philo&s;o|phick Notions do then appear among &s;ome, e&s;pecially as to the &s;ecret Exi&s;tence of the Son of God <HI>in</HI> his Father, <HI>before his real Creation or
<PB N="49" REF="50">
Generation</HI>. This I take to be the Truth of the Ca&s;e, becau&s;e the Original Writers &s;o inform me; and I always endeavour to judge in &s;uch Matters by Original Evidence; and do not pre|&s;ently believe that every Notion <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> vented &s;ome Years afterward was therefore a part of the Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, or even a Doctrine of the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it &s;elf. And I venture to promi&s;e, as I did before on another occa&s;ion, that I will &s;uppre&s;s my Papers &s;till, if even this common Opinion can be fully prov'd, that the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> did ever believe the &s;trict <HI>Co|eternity</HI> of the Son to the Father, or even his <HI>Eternal Generation</HI>, or <HI>Creation</HI> in the modern Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions. Nay I do verily believe, that the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> never was of tho&s;e Opi|nions; nor by con&s;equence can my declaring again&s;t them in the lea&s;t expo&s;e me to Cen&s;ure as an Heretick on account of that Council's De|terminations.</P>
<P>But if I be mi&s;taken, and the Second of the Fundamental Articles of Chri&s;tianity referr'd to in the Addre&s;s to Her Maje&s;ty, as part of the <HI>Nicene</HI> Creed, and deny'd by me, be that con|cerning the Divinity and Adoration of the Holy Gho&s;t, I mu&s;t &s;ay three Things to it: Fir&s;t, That what is now in&s;erted into this Creed, as to this matter, has no relation to the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>, or its proper Creed; but was added at the Council of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> afterward; as all the Learned know: And therefore this &s;hould not be repre&s;ented as belonging to the Creed or Council of <HI>Nice</HI>. Secondly, That what&s;oever is even in that our ordinary Creed, which in gro&s;s we call the <HI>Nicene</HI>, concerning the Holy Gho&s;t, has been all along u&s;ed by me, even in the So|lemn Offices of Religion, as all my Friends can te&s;tify: So that here is not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of
<PB N="50" REF="51">
an Accu&s;ation again&s;t me on this account. Thirdly, Concerning the Holy Gho&s;t, and his Name of <HI>God</HI>, and direct <HI>Invocation</HI> to him, I have kept as clo&s;e to the Churches Rules and Forms as the Nature of our Religion, and the indi&s;putable Te&s;timonies of Scripture and Anti|quity could po&s;&s;ibly allow. And in my 20th Propo&s;ition hereto relating, and, as I remember, every-where el&s;e in my late Writings, I have not affirm'd any thing of my own Opinion, but con|tented my &s;elf with &s;etting down the bare, cer|tain, undeniable Matter of Fact in this Ca&s;e, as to the fir&s;t Ages of the Church: Which, I hope, is far from the Crime of Here&s;y. And indeed, if I have been any way guilty under this Article, either as to my Writings or Practice, it has been in venturing, for the &s;ake of Peace and Uni|formity, to follow &s;omewhat too far the Lan|guage and Practice of our Church, even where I was not certain of Original Sacred Authority to &s;upport and to ju&s;tify me therein.

I do al&s;o &s;olemnly here Declare, that on a full Enquiry, I do verily believe the <HI>Con&s;titutions of the Apo&s;tles</HI> to be the mo&s;t Sacred of the Ca|nonical Books of the New Te&s;tament; and un|deniably

<P>And here I intended to conclude my Ac|count of the&s;e Matters. But becau&s;e there is lately printed a <HI>Repre&s;entation of the State of Reli|gion</HI>;
<PB N="54" REF="55">
drawn up and laid before a Committee of both Hou&s;es of Convocation, for their Appro|bation; wherein &s;everal &s;evere things are &s;aid, which I and all the World mu&s;t take to be meant of me, yet &s;ome of them are by no means true; I &s;hall make bold to &s;ay &s;omewhat by way of Vindication, without taking any far|ther Notice of that publick Body it &s;eems to belong to: Since in this ca&s;e all amounts to lit|tle more than the Authority of the fir&s;t Com|po&s;er, not fully enquired into, or openly con|tradicted by the majority of the re&s;t. Now in this Ca&s;e, what I vehemently and mo&s;t ju&s;tly Complain of in the Compiler of this Repre&s;en|tation, as I did formerly in Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI>, is, that I and my De&s;igns for the Advancement of Chri&s;tianity, are immediately, and without di&s;tinction, ranked with the known Enemies of revealed Religion, and with their pernicious Contrivances for its De&s;truction. Sure never were things &s;o di&s;agreeable and contradictory to one another confounded together, as the&s;e Authors have done in this Ca&s;e. And I dare appeal to all tho&s;e that have known me, and been al&s;o acquainted with tho&s;e Pious, Chari|table, and Religious De&s;igns, which have of late been carried on for the promoting Chri&s;ti|an Knowledge and Practice, even according to the regular Settlement of the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI>; and which in the Fourth Paragraph of this Repre&s;entation, and towards its Conclu&s;ion al&s;o are enumerated as the great Antidotes to the Wickedne&s;s, Here&s;ie and Prophanene&s;s complained of therein; whether I have not, to the utmo&s;t of my Power, promoted every one of them, and am &s;till ready to do the &s;ame, up|on all Occa&s;ions. And therefore it mu&s;t be ve|ry hard and unju&s;t, that in this ca&s;e I am &s;till
<PB N="55" REF="56">
joined with Dei&s;ts, Bla&s;phemers and Athei&s;ts; and my great and hone&s;t De&s;igns for the Re&s;to|ration of the Primitive Faith, Wor&s;hip, and Di&s;cipline, mu&s;t be reckoned among the fatal At|tempts for the &s;etting up, not only Here&s;ie, but Infidelity &amp; Prophanene&s;s among us. But ju&s;t &s;o did the fir&s;t Per&s;ecutors of the Chri&s;tians give them the Name of <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI>, or <HI>Enemies to the Gods</HI>, before they could prevail with them&s;elves or the World to bear with their Cruelties towards them. And ju&s;t &s;o do the Modern Writers of Controver&s;y frequently do with the <HI>Arians</HI> in general, and their Doctrines; fir&s;t join them with the <HI>Socinians</HI>, if not with the Dei&s;ts and Athei&s;ts, and then make the World believe that they all are, in a manner, equally bad, and almo&s;t with equal ea&s;e to be confuted. Yet I cannot but &s;ay, that how little Hone&s;ty and Sincerity &s;oe|ver this Method has in it, yet has it a great deal of Policy and Cunning; there being, I am well a&s;&s;ured, no other way to run down that Chri&s;tianity which has &s;o long been called <HI>Aria|ni&s;m</HI>, but by &s;o far blinding the Eyes of Men that it may pa&s;s in common under the Notion of <HI>Sociniani&s;m</HI>, or as a Branch of tho&s;e wicked De|&s;igns for Irreligion, Infidelity, and Prophane|ne&s;s, which it is the Duty of all pious Men, by all Proper and Chri&s;tian Methods, to put a Stop to. Tho', by the way, &s;ome good Men are of Opinion that even this Repre&s;entation it &s;elf, which propo&s;es little but &s;ome legal Re&s;traints, and the Exerci&s;e of &s;ome temporal Power and Penalties, without any through Amendment of tho&s;e great Scandals which are the principal Oc|ca&s;ions of and Temptations to Infidelity among us, e&s;pecially while Hearing and Examination are refus'd, even in the mo&s;t Nece&s;&s;ary and Im|portant Ca&s;es, will rather increa&s;e than dimi|ni&s;h
<PB N="56" REF="57">
that Di&s;temper it &s;o mightily complains of.</P>
<P>But to wave this, and to come to Particulars. The Compiler of this Repre&s;entation &s;ecurely takes the common Doctrine of a <HI>Trinity of Per|&s;ons</HI> in the <HI>Unity of the Godhead</HI>, for a Fundamen|tal Article of the Catholick Faith; when it is &s;o obvious in Antiquity that 'tis no more than the Doctrine of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>, not yet publickly examin'd and ca&s;t out of the Church: And when he cannot but &s;ee that all the truly Learned and Judicious in the&s;e Matters, nay even the Con|vocation it &s;elf, begin to de&s;ert what has &s;o long been call'd Orthodoxy, and do gradually come into &s;ome main Parts of what has been &s;til'd <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI>, which yet he in general here calls the <HI>Poi&s;on of the</HI> Arian <HI>Here&s;y</HI>, nay <HI>wicked and pe&s;tilent Errors and Bla&s;phemies</HI>. However, by the u&s;e of &s;uch terrible and affrighting Epithets and De|&s;criptions he does not de&s;ert the original &s;ubtle Methods made u&s;e of by <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> and his fir&s;t Followers; who when they found them&s;elves at a Lo&s;s how to an&s;wer &s;ome of the &s;trong Argu|ments of the <HI>Arians</HI>, immediately cry'd out, with great Vehemence, <HI>Bla&s;phemy</HI>; and &s;o af|frighted hone&s;t but &s;uper&s;titious People into their Sentiments; as is very evident in the Writings of the Fourth Age. After this, our Compiler heavily complains, not only that the <HI>Unitarians</HI> &s;et up the publick Wor&s;hip of God according to their own way, as if he would have had them neg|lect all publick Wor&s;hip to God at all; which yet is el&s;ewhere by him ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd a great In|&s;tance of Prophanene&s;s and Irreligion; but al&s;o a&s;&s;erts that the &s;ame <HI>Unitarians had weekly Sermons preach'd in Defence of them</HI>. This every body will certainly under&s;tand of Mr. <HI>Emlin</HI>, and that Meeting he formerly held in <HI>London</HI>, after his Re|lea&s;e out of Pri&s;on in <HI>Ireland</HI>: Who yet utterly de|nies
<PB N="57" REF="58">
the Fact; and a&s;&s;ures me that he ever preach'd the great, known, practical Points of Chri&s;tianity in that Meeting, while it continu|ed; and never once directly treated of either the <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> Controver&s;ies therein; e|ven while he knew &s;ome of his Hearers expect|ed it from him. With what Face then can this Author affirm &s;uch a thing, and endea|vour to draw in a whole Convocation to af|firm the &s;ame, when it is &s;o entirely fal&s;e and groundle&s;s?</P>
<P>After this, we have a large Paragraph, to &s;et forth my great Boldne&s;s in writing and pub|li&s;hing the <HI>Hi&s;torical Preface</HI>, and Dedicating it to the Convocation: For, I &s;uppo&s;e no body can imagine it belongs to any body el&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, I de&s;ire to know, how this Compiler comes to call that hone&s;t, open Appeal, I made to the Learned, and to the Convocation, to enter upon a &s;erious Examination of my Pa|pers, and to enquire into tho&s;e Sacred Truths and Books of Chri&s;tianity, which I had to lay before them, by the Name of <HI>great Boldne&s;s</HI>; nay, of <HI>Boldne&s;s in &s;upporting wicked Po&s;itions</HI> al&s;o? Is the Convocation above Looking in|to &s;uch Important Matters? Or, To whom could I more properly dedicate that <HI>Preface</HI>, than to this Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Body, who alone could le|gally amend any thing that &s;hould appear ami&s;s upon Examination? Or, Are they indeed Infal|lible in their pre&s;ent Notions, and &s;o pa&s;t all Doubts or Di&s;putes about them? Nay, &s;hould not I have been more ju&s;tly reproach'd by them, had I publi&s;h'd all to the Laity, before any Of|fer had been made to this Repre&s;entative Body of the Clergy, when they were met in Con|vocation? But when a Re&s;olution is taken to
<PB N="58" REF="59" MS="Y">
blacken, the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive Things &s;hall be mi&s;con&s;trued and perverted. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible, indeed, for me to do any thing, in order to my De&s;igns, but &s;ome or other will pretend they have Rea&s;on to take Offence: While at the &s;ame time not only I, but many others a|mong the hone&s;t and &s;incere, have the ju&s;te&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence given us, by &s;uch an open and barefac'd Rejection of Enquiry and Exa|mination, and this in Points of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to every good Chri&s;tian's Faith and Practice; nay, by &s;uch a Body of Men, as are of all others under the &s;tronge&s;t Obli|gations to &s;uch a fair and impartial Enquiry and Examination. But then, what he adds at the Conclu&s;ion of this Paragraph, which all the World mu&s;t apply to me al&s;o,
<Q>&startq;That he has &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe the foremention'd Author is &s;upported in his Undertaking, and encourag'd to pro&s;ecute it, by the liberal Contributions, and in&s;idious Applau&s;es of tho&s;e, who are the determin'd Enemies of &endq;all Religion and Goodne&s;s; is utterly fal&s;e, and highly unchri&s;tian.</Q>
As to the Applau&s;es of any of the Enemies of all Religion and Good|ne&s;s, if he thinks that I can be mov'd thereby to attempt the lea&s;t Harm to either Religion or Goodne&s;s, I am &s;ure he does not know me. But as for his Intimation,
<Q>&startq;That I am &s;upport|ed in my Undertaking by &s;uch Men's liberal &endq;Contributions, it is utterly fal&s;e and ground|le&s;s:</Q>
So fal&s;e and groundle&s;s, that when upon my Expul&s;ion from the Univer&s;ity, and a par|ticular Strait I was then in, I did not refu&s;e the kind A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal of my Chri&s;tian Friends; and under&s;tood that &s;ome of another Sort had Humanity enough to be willing; if not de&s;irous to join therein, I utterly refus'd it:
<PB N="59" REF="60">
Not barely becau&s;e I would give no Handle to any &s;uch Scandal upon my De&s;igns;<NOTE PLACE="marg">L. III. C. 8. L. IV. C. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> but be|cau&s;e I well knew the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions forbad me to accept of any &s;uch Oblations. And that the World, as well as this Author, may &s;ee that the Vehemence of my Temper is not only &s;hew'd in Oppo&s;ing Orthodoxy, I &s;hall &s;et down what I well remember was my direct An&s;wer, when I was fir&s;t told of that &s;candalous Report concerning me; <HI>viz. That I would &s;ooner &s;tarve in a Goal, than be &s;upported in that manner</HI>. The&s;e, indeed, are Things of rather too pri|vate a Nature to be publickly told. But &s;uch unju&s;t Reflections extort them from me; and &s;o mu&s;t excu&s;e what they render almo&s;t una|voidable. Tho' I mu&s;t own, I heartily com|mi&s;erate the Circum&s;tances of many among us; who &s;eeming to have a great Stock of Na|tural Probity and Humanity, have yet had the Misfortune to take their Notions of Chri&s;tia|nity from the&s;e late&s;t Antichri&s;tian Ages of it; and who therefore are not a little &s;u&s;picious as to its genuine Truth and Authority: Tho' 'tis certain, no Man of Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on ought to judge after that manner, but always to go to the Fountain-Head for Satisfaction. And I heartily and &s;incerely wi&s;h that I might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be the means of per&s;wading any of the&s;e Unhappy Per&s;ons to do &s;o; that they might &s;ee the undeniable Evidence Primi|tive Chri&s;tianity is built upon; and that no Corruptions, or Abu&s;es, or Tyranny, or Per&s;e|cutions, which the Church, in her Antichri&s;tian State, as was foretold, may have been guilty of, can at all affect the Pure and Undefil'd Re|ligion of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, as it was &s;ettled fir&s;t of all by him and his Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">But to return. When this Paragraph is over, I &s;eem to be forgotten for a great while, unle&s;s it be now and then obliquely; till among the la&s;t Cau&s;es of the Infidelily of the Age, my <HI>New Theory</HI> is reflected upon; for the De&s;cription cannot but include, if it does not alone refer to that Book. This is certainly very &s;trange; when the main and direct De&s;ign of that At|tempt was to prevent Infidelity; and that in &s;ome Points of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence. To &s;hew that Mathematicks, Rea&s;on and Philo|&s;ophy do all atte&s;t to Revelation; and that the Grand Periods and Changes mention'd in Scripture, are rationally to be &s;olv'd in A|greement with the Sacred Accounts; and that &s;uch Solutions and Accounts do mo&s;t admirably accord with, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e an Almigh|ty God, and an All-wi&s;e Providence in the Go|vernment of the World.

<Q>&startq;<HI>That</HI> my Fall manife&s;tly appears to have been occa&s;ion'd by a common Apocalyptical Notion, taken up without due Examination, in Oppo&s;ition to the Papacy; <HI>That</HI> the Author of the <HI>Con&s;ide|rations</HI> gave him an Account of this Di&s;co|very &s;oon after the Publication; and, <HI>That</HI> this has been confirm'd from other Hands &endq;al&s;o.</Q></P>
<P>Now, I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure the Reader and this Au|thor, that all this is utterly groundle&s;s; and that my Apocalyptical Notions were &s;o far at fir&s;t from occa&s;ioning the Di&s;covery, that the Anci|ent Faith was the <HI>Arian</HI>, that for &s;ome time they put &s;everal Difficulties in my way; till after my Di&s;covery thereof, my Learned Friend and I both &s;oon ob&s;erv'd their entire Agreement therewith; &s;o far, I mean, as is here refer'd to by this Author. For I mu&s;t &s;till own, that the Two Witne&s;&s;es in the Apocalyp&s;e, the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> and <HI>Albigen&s;es</HI>, not plainly appearing to have pre&s;erv'd the <HI>Arian</HI> Faith uncorrupted, is rather a Prejudice again&s;t, than an Argument for my Notions to this very Day; tho' it is by no means to be &s;et again&s;t any real Original E|vidence in that Matter. But as to that Inter|pretation in general of the Apocalyp&s;e, which &s;uppo&s;es Ten Kingdoms in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire,
<PB N="65" REF="66">
and the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to be therein mainly intended; I take it to be very plain and evi|dent. Which makes me &s;tand amaz'd at this cool and calm Writer's &s;trange Pa&s;&s;age hereto relating; which I can hardly believe to be originally his own. I &s;hall do little more than &s;et it down, and leave it to others, particularly to my Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI>'s Ca&s;tiga|tion.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;This <HI>New Theory</HI> of Antichri&s;tiani&s;m,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Premonit. p. 5.</NOTE> &s;ays this Author, which tends totally to Unchurch the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>, [this Con&s;equence I am &s;ure is none of mine:] and thence by con&s;equence &s;aps the very Foundations of our Reformation; [He &s;hould have &s;aid, above all things &s;hews the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of, and entirely ju&s;tifies that Reformation:] hath, I am bold to &s;ay, made more <HI>Arians, Socinians, Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, Dei&s;ts</HI>, and even <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI>, than any one Notion what&s;oever, that has ever &endq;been defended by Learned Men.</Q></P>
<P>But before I proceed any farther, the Reader mu&s;t give me leave to &s;et down what large and hone&s;t <HI>Conce&s;&s;ions</HI> the&s;e Writers are oblig'd to make me in the pre&s;ent Matters; &s;uch indeed as are of the greate&s;t Importance, and, in their proper Con&s;equences, will gain me almo&s;t all I contend for. The&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions are as fol|low.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Author of the Premonition is eve|ry where willing to &s;uppo&s;e that I am hone&s;t, and &s;incere in my De&s;igns; and that my Con|duct, tho' warm and vehement, may &s;till be upright and Chri&s;tian at the bottom; That however, the Conduct of God's Providence is to be principally regarded upon this Occa|&s;ion: That 'tis highly rea&s;onable that none be
<PB N="66" REF="67" MS="Y">
condemn'd, without a previous Examination; and, That &s;uch Things as are ami&s;s in the Church, are to be ob&s;erv'd, in order to their Reformation.</P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Premonit. p. 11, 12, 14, 15. Con&s;id. p. 55, 56.</NOTE>(2.) Both him&s;elf, and the Author of the <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI>, does not deny but the greate&s;t Part of the <HI>Anti-Nicene</HI> Writers &s;eem to be of my Side; and that
<Q>&startq;perhaps a far greater Mul|titude of Pa&s;&s;ages may be found in the Pri|mitive Chri&s;tian Writers which &s;peak in the Terms of the <HI>Arians</HI>, than of the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> &endq;or Catholicks:</Q>
That is, in other Words, They &s;uppo&s;e it may be true, that, by the Evidence which appears, the <HI>Arian</HI> Account is mo&s;t a|greeable to that of the greate&s;t Part of the Chri&s;tian Church, in all the Fir&s;t and Pure&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel: Which is one of the Grand Points I contend for; and which, when clear'd, will be too hard for all the uncertain Rea&s;onings of the Moderns to the contrary.</P>
<P N="3"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Premonit. p. 12, 13.</NOTE>(3.) They both &s;eem to own, that if it can be prov'd that the Names of God are Equivo|cal, and that they are not given to Chri&s;t in the &s;ame Sen&s;e with that which they bear when apply'd to God the Father, [as I &s;hall pre&s;ent|ly &s;hew them&s;elves imply they really are not;] one great Foundation of the common Doctrine is gone, and the grand Rea&s;oning of this Book will generally be of no Force again&s;t me.</P>
<P N="4"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Premonit. p. 18. Con&s;id. p. 51, 52, 53.</NOTE>(4.) They appear both freely to a&s;&s;ent to Bi&s;hop <HI>Bull</HI>'s The&s;is, concerning the Subordi|nation of the Son to the Father. And the Au|thor of the <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI>
<Q>&startq;knows not whence I conclude the Church not to hold <HI>the Father to be greater than the Son</HI>, [See the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="68" MS="Y">
Creed, the $9 Articles, and the Proper Pre|face for <HI>Trinity-Sunday</HI>;] or to deny a Subor|dination of Per&s;ons; nor the Father to be greater than the Son in this re&s;pect, That he is a Self-Original and Independent Sub&s;i|&s;tence, and the Fountain of Being to the Son; who will be always &s;o much le&s;s than the Father, as Dependency is than Indepen|dency, and that which is derived is le&s;s than that which is &s;elf-originated.&mdash; That he is the Origin of the Son, and the Fountain of &endq;Power derived to him.</Q>
And I ob&s;erve this the more particularly, becau&s;e it directly an|&s;wers the Purport of the Argument ju&s;t now refer'd to, and the Main of the Book it &s;elf; and &s;hews, that the Names of God mu&s;t be equivocally us'd in Scripture, and cannot be apply'd univocally to the Father and Son. Be|cau&s;e, in their own Hypothe&s;is, they are va&s;tly different from one another, and &s;o can|not po&s;&s;ibly (with truth) have the very &s;ame Divine Names, in the very &s;ame Exalted Ac|ceptation, apply'd to them. No more than a Vicegerent can with truth have the Royal Titles of his Prince, from whom he derives all his Au|thority and Dignity apply'd to him, in the ve|ry &s;ame exalted Signification of them. The Prince and the Vicegerent indeed are <HI>equal</HI>, or rather <HI>alike</HI>, in that they are both of the &s;ame Nature, are both Men, and &s;o Con&s;ub&s;tantial to each other. And this is one main Equality or Likene&s;s, which the Church and the&s;e Au|thors &s;o earne&s;tly contend for, as to the Fa|ther, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t. Now I, who am not &s;ure but they <HI>may</HI> be Con&s;ub&s;tantial, in that or in &s;ome other Sen&s;e, &s;hall readily al|low this Sort of Equality, or Likene&s;s, when it is once <HI>prov'd</HI>. Yet do I look upon all that
<PB N="68" REF="69" MS="Y">
has hitherto been &s;aid about it, as without any &s;ure Foundation in the Chri&s;tian Religion. Nor has the Author of the <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI>, or any one el&s;e hitherto given us &s;o much Evidence for it, as to make it worth any Man's while, in earn|e&s;t, to &s;et about its Confutation.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 18.</NOTE>(5.) The Author of the <HI>Premonition</HI> appears heartily to
<Q>&startq;wi&s;h, and, if it were in his Pow|er, likewi&s;e to endeavour, that the Liturgies of the Church were reduc'd to as great a Sim|&endq;plicity and Plainne&s;s as might be.</Q></P>
<P>This is joining with Dr. <HI>Bradford</HI>, in a mo&s;t Hone&s;t and Chri&s;tian Declaration of his, as to one of the Grand Reformations I labour for, and heartily de&s;ire were effected. And when once our Liturgies and Publick Offices &s;hall leave off Prayers to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to the entire Trinity; and &s;hall pray to the Son more rarely, and after the ancient manner, as to a Mediator, or rather as to the Father's Ap|pointed Vicegerent; to him that is our Lord, and God, and King, &s;ince he a&s;cended as our Me|diator into Heaven; and &s;hall renew the Origi|nal Doxology as it was at fir&s;t, we &s;hall the more ea&s;ily agree in our Speculative Opinions. Nor will the frightful Name of <HI>Arian</HI> after this long di&s;turb us; while all Good Men will mo&s;t rea|dily agree to lay all &s;uch Names a&s;ide, and to u&s;e no other but that of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> for all &s;uc|ceeding Generations.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) He al&s;o appears willing that Human Rea&s;onings be avoided, and that the plain Ori|ginal Te&s;timonies be the Foundation of our Faith in the&s;e Matters. For this I take to be imply'd in his &s;aying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Premonit. p. 21.</NOTE> that <HI>My</HI> 17<HI>th Plain Que|&s;tion</HI>,
<PB N="69" REF="70" MS="Y">
including that very Notion, <HI>&s;hall not be conte&s;ted with me</HI>.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) They both freely own,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 15, 16. Append. N^o. 9, 10.</NOTE> that our Saviour was not only <HI>Begotten</HI> but <HI>Created</HI> by God; and this, exactly as I a&s;&s;ert, a little before the Crea|tion of the World: And that what Eternity &s;oever &s;ome Ancient Chri&s;tians a&s;crib'd to him, it was before his <HI>Generation</HI>, or <HI>Creation</HI>; or was, in &s;hort, what I call a <HI>Metaphy&s;ick Eternity</HI>. This is owning another Great Truth which I con|tend for. And till it be &s;hew'd that that &s;ort of Metaphy&s;ick Eternity was pretended to be more than a Philo&s;ophick Notion; and that it imply'd a real Exi&s;tence, as of a di&s;tinct Active Being or Per&s;on, this Conce&s;&s;ion will imply, that the common Notions of <HI>Eternal Generation</HI>, and of the Proper <HI>Coeternity</HI> of the Son to the Father, are groundle&s;s, and no Part of the Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) This Author cannot deny that there are &s;hrewd Su&s;picions produc'd by me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Premon. p. 21, &amp;c. Con&s;id. p. 51, &amp;c.</NOTE> as to the Hone&s;ty of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>; and is very ready to own, that his Authority may well be &s;et a&s;ide in the&s;e Controver&s;ies; and is plainly of Opi|nion, that the Original Writings can alone be of great Authority in the&s;e Points; or &s;uch Books as were written by <HI>Jews</HI> and Chri&s;tians before ever he appear'd in the World. Nay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Premon. p. 34.</NOTE>
<Q>&startq;That no one ought to be at all led by any <HI>par|ticular Men</HI>, but to take their Chri&s;tian Faith and Practice from tho&s;e mo&s;t Sacred and Pri|mitive Writers, which liv'd long before the Ri&s;e of the Controver&s;ies in the Fourth Cen|&endq;tury.</Q>
Which are Conce&s;&s;ions of very great Con&s;equence in the&s;e Matters.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="70" REF="71" MS="Y">(9.) This Author grants, and ob&s;erves in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Montani&s;m</HI>, which I think he might well have repeated in this Book, upon &s;o fair an Occa&s;ion; That while the <HI>Montani&s;t</HI> Here|&s;y, in &s;ome or other of its Branches, &s;pread it &s;elf into almo&s;t all the other Sects and Parties of Chri&s;tians, yet could it <HI>never get any Footing among the</HI> Arians; which is an illu&s;trious Te&s;ti|mony to them: and does not well agree with this Author's calling them here a <HI>Philo&s;ophick Sect</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Premon. p. 9.</NOTE> unle&s;s he means <HI>Arius</HI> and his peculiar Followers only by that Appellation; for whom I am no way concern'd in this Controver&s;y; but only for that Primitive Chri&s;tianity, which has &s;o long pa&s;s'd by the Name of <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI>, and for the genuine Profe&s;&s;ors of it.</P>
<P>But now, to leave the&s;e fair, ju&s;t, and equi|table Conce&s;&s;ions of this Author, and of his Friend, which, how very far they reach, is left to the Con&s;ideration of the Sagacious Reader; I mu&s;t now come to the Oppo&s;itions to, and Reflections on me, and on &s;ome of my Opi|nions: Concerning which I make the follow|ing General Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That the&s;e Con&s;iderations and Letters do all <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI>, rather than <HI>prove</HI> the Points in Di&s;pute. For certainly, no Man of ordinary Under&s;tanding will believe that the uncertain Deductions, and remote Compari&s;on of Texts, and &s;mall Critici&s;ms made u&s;e of in the&s;e Con|&s;iderations and Letters, would ever have in|form'd any one of the modern Doctrine of the Trinity, who had it not before. No certainly; they are no other than Attempts to prove what the Author ever believed from his Education, and no more. If I could find, that any one &s;a|gacious,
<PB N="71" REF="72" MS="Y">
diligent, and unbia&s;s'd Per&s;on had laid a&s;ide all the modern Notions in the&s;e Matters, and read over the Scripture, and all the Origi|nal Remains of Chri&s;tianity, as I did, on pur|po&s;e to &s;ee what the Old Doctrines of the Go|&s;pel were in the&s;e Points; and after &s;uch a Pro|cedure, declar'd as hone&s;tly that they found it not le&s;s plainly agreeable to <HI>Athana&s;iani&s;m</HI>, than I can declare I found it to be to <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI>, this would &s;hock me indeed; and would make a Review of the Whole highly nece&s;&s;ary. But when this Author, taking his Notions in the main for granted, only produces a few Ob&s;er|vations, by which he hopes to e&s;cape the Force of my plainer and more direct Te&s;timonies to the contrary; and to divert the Reader from hearkning to them; there is le&s;s Nece&s;&s;ity to be&s;tow any great Con&s;ideration upon them.</P>
<P>Thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;id. p. 100, &amp;c.</NOTE> when this Author builds on an un|grounded Tradition, or &s;uper&s;titious Fancy of the <HI>Jews</HI>, that <HI>Jehovah</HI>, the <HI>Nomen Tetragram|maton</HI>, is in &s;uch a tran&s;cendent degree the mo&s;t Sacred and Incommunicable Name of the Supreme God; and that therefore when the <HI>Greek</HI> Word which an&s;wer'd to it, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, is ap|ply'd &s;o continually to our Saviour, it implies an <HI>Equality of Nature</HI>, or <HI>Samene&s;s of Sub&s;tance</HI> with the Supreme God; I know not what An|&s;wer to return to &s;o weak an Argument: While in my Ob&s;ervation of the Scripture-Dialect, the Name <HI>Jehovah</HI> no way relates to the Sub|&s;tance of God; and is one of the mo&s;t com|municable, as to the Son, of all the re&s;t; and while its Communication to him no more im|plies any &s;uch Equality or Samene&s;s, than the Communication of other of God's Names to Angels, to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, to Magi&s;trates, or the like, implies, that all tho&s;e Beings are in &s;ome &s;ort
<PB N="72" REF="73" MS="Y">
equal to, and con&s;ub&s;tantial with him al&s;o. And the Reader is to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame Ob&s;er|vation, as to other of the Names of God al&s;o.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;orts of Rea&s;onings are not of great force, in Ca&s;es where we know the Doctrines for which they &s;erve are otherwi&s;e certainly true: But to think of <HI>determining</HI> &s;uch difficult Que&s;tions as the&s;e by them, &s;hews how far Prejudice and Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion can carry Men, when once they are bya&s;s'd for common No|tions.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, (2.) That the&s;e Con&s;iderations, with others of the modern Books, &s;eem to me to build upon &s;uch a Compari&s;on of Texts in the Old and New Te&s;tament as the late Com|mentators have not fully under&s;tood, and which the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions alone, and tho&s;e Scriptures and Fathers that continued down the &s;ame Explications, can enable them to under|&s;tand; I mean tho&s;e Places where the Son of God <HI>per&s;onates</HI> the Supreme God, and &s;peaks directly in his Name to Mankind. Which Ca&s;e is &s;o peculiar, without the Po&s;&s;ibili|ty of a Parallel, and not to be known with|out Revelation, that I look on the modern De|ductions of this Nature, of which the Contro|ver&s;y about the Divinity of our Saviour is &s;o full, to be very weak, and upon almo&s;t no Foundation at all. And this indeed renders it improper to go far into tho&s;e particular Rea&s;on|ings, till by the freer Publication, and more general Knowledge of tho&s;e Con&s;titutions, and of the other corre&s;ponding Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture and Antiquity, the Chri&s;tian Reader be better prepar'd to judge of that Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74" MS="Y">And, (3.) I ob&s;erve, That the common Do|ctrine of the <HI>Trinity</HI>, or, that Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, are <HI>All Three</HI> Equal, and Con&s;ub|&s;tantial, and One God, is almo&s;t without the lea&s;t Shadow of Proof in the Sacred and Pri|mitive Books of our Religion. Some &s;mall weak Pretences may be made for a <HI>Bina$</HI>, or, That the Father and Son are in &s;ome &s;ort <HI>Equal, Con&s;ub&s;tantial</HI>, and <HI>One God</HI>; but for a <HI>Ternary</HI>, or Trinity, the Joining the Holy Spi|rit to the other Two, and Paying him Invo|cation thereupon, it has little but the Forms of Bapti&s;m and of Ble&s;&s;ing, as injudiciou&s;ly inter|preted by the Moderns, and that of Doxology, as corrupted by 'em to &s;upport it. So that 'tis a mo&s;t &s;urprizing thing, how &s;o many Ages of the Church &s;hould go into it, and be im|pos'd on by it; and is a Demon&s;tration that that <HI>Efficacy of Error</HI> which <HI>Paul</HI> the Apo&s;tle foretels of the Antichri&s;tian Times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The&s;&s;. II.11.</NOTE> has in this Point had its full Effect among us. So that I cannot but expect that the Learned immediate|ly yield up this plain and clear Point, and leave off all Invocation to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to the whole Trinity, by way of Preparation to the Examination of the other. For if they will not relinqui&s;h Doctrines and Practices &s;o evidently unju&s;tifiable as the&s;e are, all Di&s;pu|tation about the other mu&s;t be to no manner of purpo&s;e; and the Church mu&s;t re&s;olve to wave the way of Argument and Evidence, and in all Things, with the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>, entirely acquie&s;ce in her own <HI>Unerring Infallibility</HI>.</P>
<P>But now, before I proceed to other Matters, give me leave to note a very &s;trange Pa&s;&s;age or two in this Premonition to the Reader; where to excu&s;e the Omi&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;ages
<PB N="74" REF="75">
on the <HI>Arian</HI> Side in the Primitive Fathers, they being own'd likely to be too numerous for tho&s;e which the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> can produce; we have the&s;e Words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Premonit. p. 11.</NOTE>
<Q>&startq;There is nothing more ea&s;y than for a Man of Parts and Learning to puzzle any Cau&s;e in the World, when once it comes to be try'd by Number of Au|&endq;thorities, and the Evidence is extended too far.</Q>
And afterwards;<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 14, 15.</NOTE>
<Q>&startq;As for the Authorities and Te&s;timonies of the Ancients, tho' he thinks an <HI>Arian</HI> can have no great Rea&s;on to boa&s;t of them, <HI>when fairly interpreted and &s;tated</HI>, he will not &s;o much in&s;i&s;t upon them; le&s;t this &s;hould be an Occa&s;ion of intricating and &endq;protracting the Que&s;tion.</Q></P>
<P>This is ju&s;t like the Caution of a Man, who being to try a Cau&s;e in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI>, depend|ing on a Matter of Fact, that was 60 or 70 Years pa&s;t, &s;hould in&s;i&s;t, That to hear all the Old Men and Women that could witne&s;s to the Ca&s;e in hand was not &s;o proper, and would take up much Time, and probably puzzle the Cau&s;e at la&s;t; and &s;o &s;hould move, that few of them might be heard; but that the Council might be directed to find out more agreeable Topicks to in&s;i&s;t on, that they might &s;ooner come to a Determination. Nor is this any other than the very Ca&s;e in hand; &s;ince what Doctrines Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles deliver'd, is, for certain, no other than an Ancient Fact; and by con&s;e|quence can no otherwi&s;e be fairly determin'd, but by the&s;e very Witne&s;&s;es, the Original Sa|cred and Primitive Writers in the Chri&s;tian Church. Nay, even the Confining all to the pre&s;ent Sacred Books, is to beg the Que&s;tion in part al&s;o; &s;ince many of tho&s;e which others &s;tile only Primitive Fathers, will evidently ap|pear, on Examination, to belong to the Cata|logue
<PB N="75" REF="76">
of Sacred Writers al&s;o; and only to have been thence excluded in later Ages, without any &s;ufficient Authority for &s;uch their Exclu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Then our Author thinks I mi&s;took,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 15, &amp;c.</NOTE> when I &s;uppo&s;ed Dr. <HI>Allix</HI> and another excellent Per|&s;on to be on my &s;ide, from &s;ome Words which they formerly &s;aid in my Hearing. Pray, Sir, where do I &s;ay they were on my Side? or in|deed that they gave me the Occa&s;ion of falling into <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI>? I told two plain Facts, and thence you &s;uppo&s;e what Inferences I made, without knowing a Word of the Matter: And then at la&s;t draw your own Corollaries from the Inferences you your &s;elf father upon me. I de&s;ire my Readers will take my Words as they lie in my own Book; and not venture any far|ther by Gue&s;s, for they will very often find them&s;elves mi&s;taken in &s;uch their Conjectures: As all Men are who pretend to know Matters of Fact by them, without authentick Te&s;timony; and which indeed I look upon as one of the grand Cheats and Impo&s;itions with which that we call Learning and Critici&s;m has fre|quently abu&s;ed Mankind; and of which the In|&s;tances are innumerable.</P>
<P>After this the Author of the Premonition comes to the <HI>Plain Que&s;tions</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 19, &amp;c.</NOTE> and to his Friends An&s;wers to them. Now in this Ca&s;e I own I find my &s;elf very much di&s;appointed; for where the Title Page promi&s;ed an <HI>An&s;wer to my Plain Que&s;tions</HI>, I expected a direct An&s;wer to them, and indeed to all of them: Yet is it confe&s;s'd that the Author has not taken expre&s;s Notice of one half of them; nay, has mainly in&s;i&s;ted on the Three Fir&s;t; and 'tis expected the others mu&s;t as it were, &s;hrink away of their own ac|cord; or I mu&s;t take &s;ome occa&s;ional Hints and
<PB N="76" REF="77" MS="Y">
Inferences for a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to them. This is but very poor imperfect Procedure in Points of &s;uch mighty Con&s;equence as the&s;e are, and which I &s;o &s;olemnly propos'd to the Chri&s;tian World. Nor indeed are any one of tho&s;e Three properly an&s;wered at all, in the plain Sen&s;e that I intended them; <HI>viz.</HI> Where, or in what Places of the Sacred and Primitive Books of our Religion, the Three Per&s;ons are called <HI>One God</HI>; or Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be properly <HI>Equal</HI> to the Father; or when he is call'd <HI>God</HI>, has the known <HI>Divine Titles</HI> or <HI>Epithets</HI> plainly apply'd to him? Becau&s;e 'tis very &s;urprizing that Do|ctrines of &s;o &s;trange a Nature, and mighty Con|&s;equence &s;hould be true, and Fundamental in Chri&s;tianity, and yet not one plain, home, un|doubted Example of &s;uch Notions and Language &s;hould appear in all the original Books of our Reli|gion: but that all mu&s;t &s;till be drawn out by way of remote Inference, and uncertain Rea&s;on|ings; nay, &s;ometimes in direct Contradiction to the expre&s;s Words of Scripture al&s;o and An|tiquity. This was the true Foundation of tho&s;e Plain Que&s;tions. Yet in An&s;wer to this, our Author does not pretend to find tho&s;e Places and Language which I wanted: He cannot &s;hew where directly the Three Per&s;ons are called <HI>One God</HI>; nor where the Son is &s;aid to be <HI>Equal</HI> to the Father; nor where tho&s;e Divine <HI>Epithets</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> are plainly apply'd to him when he is called God: But becau&s;e he is not able to &s;hew what cannot be &s;hewn, he is forc'd to betake him&s;elf to the u&s;ual way of remote Inferences, and uncertain Rea&s;onings in the Ca&s;e: Which way has been &s;o often tried, and the be&s;t made of it the Matter would bear, that I do not &s;ee to what great purpo&s;e this Repetition of &s;uch Arguments, with the Addition of &s;ome others

of the like Nature are here publi&s;hed; at lea&s;t why they are &s;et down as An&s;wers to my <HI>Plain Que&s;tions</HI>: E&s;pecially while the Nece&s;&s;ity the Author was under of omitting any direct An&s;wers, and of having recour&s;e to the&s;e other Methods, is hereby become more vi&s;ible. So that I take this Book to be an open Acknow|ledgment that tho&s;e <HI>Plain Que&s;tions</HI> are, in their known obvious Sen&s;e, really unan&s;werable: Which I de&s;ire the Reader to ob&s;erve upon this Occa&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 38,&mdash;43.</NOTE> But then to leave the Author of the Con&s;iderations, and to come to the Author of the Premonition, and his 21 <HI>Plain Que&s;tions</HI> put to me, I confe&s;s I am not a little &s;urpriz'd at them. Not by Rea&s;on of any difficulty to An|&s;wer them, but on Account of the Unfairne&s;s of &s;everal of them; the playing with the Am|biguity of Words in many; and the Air of A&s;|&s;urance with which they are propo&s;ed and en|forced in this Place. As if becau&s;e I propo&s;ed &s;o many Plain Que&s;tions, with great A&s;&s;urance, when I had fully examin'd the Matter, and had the Ancient Te&s;timonies ready by me to prove all that I &s;aid, and thereby knew that they could not be directly an&s;wered, this Author had a Right to propo&s;e as many Que&s;tions to me, with the &s;ame A&s;&s;urance; while he mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, if he has made the &s;ame Search that I have done, that they were mo&s;t ea&s;ily to be An|&s;wer'd; and that commonly from plain direct Texts or Te&s;timonies al&s;o. And tho' I might expect a plain and direct An&s;wer to all my 21 Que&s;tions, before I do the &s;ame to the&s;e; yet &s;hall I not in&s;i&s;t on that Privilege, but give a brief and imperfect An&s;wer to every one of them in order; I &s;ay, a brief and imperfect one, becau&s;e if I do it fully &amp; largely, I mu&s;t tran&s;cribe too great a Number of Texts and Te&s;timonies from that

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I.

<P><HI>A.</HI> II. This is my Grand A&s;&s;ertion, that in a true proper Sen&s;e there is but <HI>One God</HI>, and <HI>One Lord</HI>, and <HI>One Object of Divine Wor&s;hip</HI>, when taken in a &s;trict Acceptation; I mean God the
<PB N="79" REF="80" MS="Y">
Father only; as is undeniable in all the Old Books of our Religion. And that according|ly, when the Son is called <HI>God</HI> or <HI>Lord</HI>, or the Wor&s;hip paid him is call'd <HI>Divine Wor&s;hip</HI>, tho&s;e Words are u&s;ed in a lower, derivative, and, to u&s;e <HI>Origen</HI>'s Language, in an <HI>abu&s;ive</HI> Accepta|tion. Nay indeed, whatever Lower Degree of Wor&s;hip was paid to the Son, or Spirit, are deem'd rather Part of our Wor&s;hip paid to the Father, as done to <HI>his</HI> Son and <HI>his</HI> Spirit, by his Command, and for his Glory, than any pro|per Original Independent Wor&s;hip, paid di&s;tinctly to them&s;elves. The Pa&s;&s;ages cited by me out of <HI>Origen</HI>, in my Second Reply to Dr. <HI>Allix</HI>, e&s;pe|cially when compar'd with the Liturgies in the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions, will give great Light to this Matter.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> III. The Father is in Scripture and An|tiquity call'd the <HI>Primary God</HI>, the <HI>God over all</HI>, the <HI>God of Gods</HI>, and the <HI>God of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf; and has all the highe&s;t Epithets po&s;|&s;ible.

This Author him&s;elf owns him <HI>God</HI>, and owns him <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> to the Father: So that if he denies him to be a <HI>&s;ubordinate God</HI>, he takes away almo&s;t all the &s;eeming Force of his Friend's Con&s;iderations, which is entirely built upon the like way of Rea&s;oning.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> V. This Que&s;tion is very &s;urprizing: As if the Scriptures could expre&s;sly deny that, which no Chri&s;tians appear to have ever
<PB N="81" REF="82">
dream'd of till After-ages. Nor can I prove the Scripture has expre&s;sly contradicted Tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation, nor the Wor&s;hip of <HI>Cherubims</HI>, or <HI>Thrones</HI>. This is the very thing I com|plain of, That the <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantiality</HI> is made a Doctrine of the Go&s;pel, without the lea&s;t pre|tence to Divine Revelation, or Original Au|thority. Nay, it is certain, that when the Words <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> came to be us'd, the Council of <HI>Antioch</HI> expre&s;sly &s;aid, the Son was <HI>not Con&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> or <HI>Coe&s;&s;ential</HI> to the Father; as did <HI>Origen</HI> as expre&s;sly affirm he was, as to his <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI>, different from him.</P>
<P>Q. VI. <HI>Where do the Scriptures or mo&s;t Primitive Writers &s;ay any thing of the Sub&s;tance or E&s;&s;ence of the</HI> Holy Spirit? <HI>And where do they &s;ay that God, and the Spirit of God, are of a</HI> different <HI>Nature, E&s;&s;ence and Sub&s;tance? Or how can the Spirit of God &s;earch the Things of God, unle&s;s it be of the</HI> &s;ame <HI>Nature with God? This I want to have explain'd by clear Te&s;timonies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> VI. This Que&s;tion is more &s;urprizing than the former; and my Complaint is &s;till greater, that even the <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantiality</HI> and <HI>Co|e&s;&s;entiality</HI> of the Holy Gho&s;t is made a Do|ctrine of the Go&s;pel, while all know that no Chri&s;tian ever heard of &s;uch Doctrines or Language till long after the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>. As to the Spirit's <HI>&s;earching the deep things of God</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. II.10.</NOTE> as a Proof of his Con&s;ub&s;tantiality; I think it proves ju&s;t the contrary: For what need of Search and Enquiry, if the Spirit knew tho&s;e deep Things as well as the Father? Nay, How can there be room for Search, unle&s;s there be Two real Beings concern'd?<NOTE PLACE="marg">v.11.</NOTE> And as the <HI>Spirit of a man</HI> is, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Philo&s;ophy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The&s;&s;.

<HI>knows</HI>; &s;o, in the Parallel, is the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> really different from the God who&s;e Things he <HI>knows</HI>; tho' our modern Philo&s;ophy has confounded both together in both Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Q. VII. <HI>Where is the Spirit of God called a</HI> Crea|ture <HI>either in the Scriptures or in the mo&s;t Ancient Chri&s;tian Writers? One plain and po&s;itive Te&s;timony &s;hall here &s;uffice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> VII. The Scripture &s;ays, <HI>All things were made by the Son, and without him was not any thing made:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John I.3.</NOTE> Whence <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> infer, that the Holy Spirit, which all own as deriv'd from or by the Son, was <HI>made</HI> by him. The Apo|&s;tles, in their Con&s;titutions, &s;ay, God is <HI>The Maker of the Holy Spirit by Chri&s;t</HI>. The Recognitions &s;ay, The Spirit is <HI>a Being made by a Being which was him&s;elf made</HI>. So that indeed, <HI>a Being made</HI> of the Father, by the Mini&s;tration of the Son, is more &s;trictly genuine as to the Holy Spirit, than that of one <HI>created</HI>, in the Ancient Language. Tho' I do not know any Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o nice a Di&s;tinction; nor do I know any Te&s;timony again&s;t this Doctrine, till after the Council of <HI>Nice</HI>.</P>
<P>Q. VIII. <HI>Where is it &s;aid that the Son is to be wor&s;hip'd only with an</HI> Inferior Wor&s;hip, <HI>and not with the &s;ame Wor&s;hip wherewith we wor&s;hip the Fa|ther? Let me but &s;ee where it is once &s;o written; and I will never Honour the Son as the Father is honour'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> VIII. The Word <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI>, in the Old Books, as well as <HI>Adoration</HI>, were general, and &s;ignified frequently much the &s;ame that Honour and Re&s;pect do now; as 'tis certain <HI>Ju&s;tin Mar|tyr</HI> and <HI>Origen</HI> under&s;tood them: While the former own'd them both not improper to be apply'd to Angels al&s;o; and the latter ob&s;erves,
<PB N="83" REF="84">
that the Scripture applies the latter even to Men. So the &s;everal <HI>In&s;tances</HI>, and <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Frequency</HI> of Wor&s;hip paid to every Being, are the &s;ure&s;t Ways of Di&s;tinction, as to &s;u|preme or &s;ubordinate Wor&s;hip, as to &s;upreme or &s;ubordinate Knowledge, Power and Good|ne&s;s own'd thereby. Now here 'tis certain, the Father has all Sorts of Wor&s;hip, and after the highe&s;t manner, continually paid him by the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians: That the Son has not all Sorts of Wor&s;hip; Has any but &s;eldom, and in a va&s;tly inferior Manner and Stile, paid him by them; And that only as the Father's Vicegerent, and our Mediator, and as com|manded by the Father, and ultimately tending to his Glory. But then the Holy Spirit has hardly any &s;uch Honours paid him as can well come under our Notion of <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Adoration</HI>, tho' they would come under the An|cient larger Notion of them. But &s;ure this Author never read the 17th of <HI>John</HI>, if he thinks the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, 'that we mu&s;t honour the Son <HI>as</HI> we 'honour the Father, does at all imply any pro|per Equality in that Wor&s;hip. Nay this Equality al&s;o &s;eems utterly irreconcilable to this Author's own Opinions, when he &s;o fully confe&s;&s;es the In|feriority and Subordination of the Son to the Father; and, by con&s;equence, I &s;hould think, that the Wor&s;hip to be paid him &s;hould be infe|rior and &s;ubordinate Wor&s;hip al&s;o.</P>
<P>Q. IX. <HI>Where doth the Scripture teach us</HI> Two <HI>or</HI> Three <HI>Degrees of Divine Wor&s;hip? And where do the mo&s;t Primitive Writers di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e</HI> &s;everal Wor&s;hips <HI>to prevent our falling into</HI> Idolatry? <HI>A very few plain Te&s;timonies will here &s;atisfy me better, than all the</HI> Popi&s;h <HI>Di&s;tinctions</HI>.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> XI. The &s;ame for this. Only I add, That we ought to u&s;e the Name of the Holy Gho&s;t in Doxologies, becau&s;e we have Apo&s;to|lical Command and Practice for it: And we ought not to Invocate him, becau&s;e we want all &s;uch Command and Practice. Not to &s;ay that the Original Form of Doxology does ra|ther glorify the Father by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit, than directly glorify the Spirit him&s;elf; any farther than 'tis for the Honour of the Spirit him&s;elf to be thus join'd with the Father and Son in Doxologies.</P>
<P>Q. XII. <HI>Whether the</HI> Subordinate <HI>Wor&s;hip of a Creature was not the Beginning of that Apo&s;tacy from the Primitive Faith and Practice, which by Mr.</HI> Whi&s;ton <HI>is call'd</HI> Antichri&s;tiani&s;m? <HI>And whether, if the Inferior Wor&s;hip of Creatures, highly honour'd by God, be</HI> Anti-chri&s;tian <HI>and Idolatrous, in the Pa|pi&s;ts,
<PB N="85" REF="86">
it be not &s;o al&s;o in the</HI> Arians, <HI>or in any other Anti-trinitarians?</HI></P>

<P>Q. XIII. <HI>Whether Christ be not</HI> properly <HI>in Scripture call'd the</HI> Son <HI>of God? And where is it &s;aid that the</HI> Son, <HI>or</HI> Word, <HI>was</HI> created, <HI>either in the Old or New Te&s;tament? I de&s;ire but one &s;ingle In|&s;tance, according to the Original.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> XIII. Chri&s;t is properly, or in a pecu|liar Sen&s;e &s;til'd the <HI>Son</HI>, the <HI>Only Son</HI>, the <HI>Only-begotten Son of God</HI>; and he is &s;aid to be <HI>created</HI> or <HI>made</HI>, to be God's <HI>Creature</HI> or <HI>Workman&s;hip</HI>, by above Twenty Sacred and Primitive Wri|ters of our Religion; as I have already rec|kon'd them up in my Defence de&s;ign'd for the Convocation. As to any di&s;tinct Mode of Sub&s;i&s;tence of the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>before</HI> his Generation and Creation, I find no Foot&s;teps of it among Chri&s;tians till Philo&s;ophy prevail'd; nor, as far as I can ob&s;erve, did they that fir&s;t &s;pake of it, ever pretend it to be other than a Philo|&s;ophick Notion: So it comes in very odly in this place.</P>
<P>Q. XIV. <HI>What Ab&s;urdity is it to think a</HI> Son <HI>to be of the &s;ame Nature and E&s;&s;ence, or Su&s;tance, with his own</HI> Proper <HI>Father? And wherein doth this con|tradict Scripture, Antiquity, or Rea&s;on? Or why &s;hould it be more incredible in</HI> Heavenly, <HI>than in</HI> Earthly Things? <HI>One plain Rea&s;on, or one plain Text is here only de&s;ir'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> XIV. I do not here intend to &s;peak of the Ab&s;urdity of the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> Scheme, nor
<PB N="86" REF="87">
how unintelligible it is, that the <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> &s;hould be Beings really different, and yet of the &s;ame <HI>Nature, E&s;&s;ence</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> with the Father, while &s;till there is &s;uppos'd but <HI>One Sub&s;tance</HI>, and <HI>One E&s;&s;ence</HI>, and <HI>One God</HI> all the while. Indeed I de|&s;ire &s;ome Evidence, that when the Scriptures and the Ancients call Chri&s;t properly and peculiarly the <HI>Son</HI> of God, they had any regard to &s;uch a No|tion. If the Church will own this <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantiality</HI> to be an Un&s;criptural, Uncertain, Philo&s;ophick Opinion, and will clear her Articles, Creeds, and Wor&s;hip of &s;uch Things, let tho&s;e that &s;ee Rea&s;on believe it if they plea&s;e; but for my &s;elf, I own I want Original Proof, before I yield my A&s;&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>Q. XV. <HI>Where is it &s;aid that</HI> God <HI>was ever without his</HI> Word, <HI>or the</HI> Father <HI>without his</HI> Son? <HI>I de&s;ire but one plain In&s;tance either in the Scriptures, or in Primitive Antiquity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> XV. The Anciente&s;t Writers ever call the Father <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Eternal</HI>, but never call the Son &s;o: They al&s;o generally agree that he was <HI>$reated</HI> a little before the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation. When Philo&s;ophy came in, &s;everal &s;uppos'd he was <HI>in</HI> his Father <HI>potentially</HI>, or as an <HI>Attri|bute</HI> before, and was after begotten or created into a Son, into a real di&s;tinct, active Being. Yet does <HI>Tertullian</HI> him&s;elf, one of the grand Patrons of the Author's <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, expre&s;sly own God once was not a Father, and had not a Son. And I confe&s;s, I want Evidence for even that Metaphy&s;ick Eternity before his Creation or Generation: As I am fully &s;atisfy'd there is no other Eternity can be a&s;crib'd to him.</P>
<P>Q. XVI. <HI>Where is it &s;aid that God was ever with|out his own</HI> Spirit? <HI>Or that this Divine Spirit was
<PB N="87" REF="88" MS="Y">
not of the &s;ame Nature and Power with Him&s;elf; but</HI> far Inferior; <HI>A &s;ingle In&s;tance is only de&s;ir'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> XVI. This Que&s;tion is utterly ground|le&s;s, &s;ince tho&s;e Ancients who were for the Metaphy&s;ick Eternity of the Son, do not ap|pear to have had the lea&s;t Notion of his Exer|ci&s;e of Power, or of the Spirit's actual Deriva|tion from the Father by him, till his actual Creation or Generation, a little before the World.

They own'd him <HI>&s;uch a Creature</HI> as was alone de|riv'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> from the Father, and by who&s;e In&s;trumentality all the other Creatures were made; and thence own'd his Nature va&s;tly &s;uperior to that of all tho&s;e &s;ubordinate Crea|tures; the Wor&s;hip of which alone can be pro|perly &s;til'd any Criminal <HI>Creature-Wor&s;hip</HI>.</P>

<P>But before I proceed I mu&s;t take notice of one Thing, which is mention'd by the Author of the Premonition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 22.</NOTE> and is frequently in the Mouths of the Writers for the Church and for Chri&s;tianity; <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;ome Things are to be
<PB N="91" REF="92">
conceal'd for fear they <HI>gratify Athei&s;ts and Dei&s;ts</HI>. Certainly nothing prejudices Athei&s;ts and Dei&s;ts more than &s;uch Procedure and Expre&s;&s;ions; while they thereby perceive Remains of <HI>pious Frauds</HI> every where; and &s;u&s;pect it has been &s;o from the beginning: They &s;ee they are not to be let plainly into the Truth of Facts, but to be manag'd with Cunning and worldly Pru|dence, for fear of being di&s;gu&s;ted at Chri&s;tia|nity. This is not I think over-con&s;i&s;tent with that Truth and Perfect Sincerity which natural and revealed Religion do require, and which is mo&s;t fully exacted by the Chri&s;tian In&s;titution. I believe Truth will never hurt Truth; nor will Hone&s;ty do any harm to our old genuine Chri|&s;tianity. I am by no means &s;en&s;ible that our Reli|gion, as contain'd in Scripture, &s;tands in need of any &s;ort of Prevarication or Concealments of this Nature: And I ever expect that the Ble&s;|&s;ing of God will &s;o much more go along with downright Hone&s;ty and undi&s;guis'd Sincerity, that I e&s;teem one great Rea&s;on why we gain &s;o little ground upon Infidelity to be this, that we <HI>leave the Paths of Uprightne&s;s to walk in the ways of Darkne&s;s</HI>; we u&s;e human Prudence and world|ly Policy, in&s;tead of downright Truth and perfect Integrity. Nor do I think the plain Forgeries and Cheats of <HI>Antichri&s;tiani&s;m</HI> do real|ly tend to the Harm of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI>, but indeed rather to its Commendation; &s;ince it &s;elf is &s;o utterly an Enemy to them; whatever &s;ome good Men, not yet quite got out of that cor|rupt State, may be ready to imagine upon this Occa&s;ion. Nor ought therefore the unfair Pro|ceedings of, and &s;ince <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>'s Days, be al|ledg'd as any Reproach to the ancienter, pure, and undefil'd Religion of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Only I grant, that every Accu&s;ation of this Nature
<PB N="92" REF="93">
&s;hould be well prov'd. And I a&s;&s;ure this Au|thor I did not &s;peak at Random in my la&s;t Que|&s;tion, which concern'd this Matter; but can &s;oon be ready for the full Proof of what is there|in intimated to the World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;id. p 57, &amp;c. Premon. p. 21, &amp;c.</NOTE>As to the Author of the <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI> Vindi|cation of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>, 'tis very weak; but as to the Author of the <HI>Premonition</HI>'s Management about him, 'tis artful and &s;hrewd enough, but &s;uch as by no means tends to his real Vindica|tion: As plainly implying, that if we allow our &s;elves to make a nice Enquiry about him, and compare one Pa&s;&s;age and Fact with ano|ther, and with the other Authentick Writers, and go by our Evidence, it will be very hard to ju&s;tify him: But if no le&s;s Proof for his Wickedne&s;s be nece&s;&s;ary, than would be re|quir'd in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> to convict him legal|ly of Forgery, he thinks, at this Di&s;tance it will be impo&s;&s;ible. In which way of putting this Matter I perfectly agree with him. And, as a &s;mall Part of &s;uch Legal Evidence is every where &s;ufficient to bla&s;t the Reputation of any man living, and to prevent his Impo&s;ing on the World afterward; &s;o &s;hall I be content that <HI>A|thana&s;ius</HI>'s Reputation be in the &s;ame State; I mean, that it be own'd not legally taken away, &s;o that his Books be thereupon &s;uppre&s;s'd and burnt, as full of notorious Forgeries; but that it be e&s;teem'd &s;o very weak, that we no more &s;uf|fer his Authority in the lea&s;t to impo&s;e upon the Chri&s;tian World any longer. And if that Point be once &s;ecur'd, and true Chri&s;tianity be out of danger of being corrupted by him, I &s;hall not be ve|ry unea&s;y if, in his per&s;onal capacity, he retain what Remainder of good Opinion he can among his former Admirers. For, as this Author com|fortably pleads in his behalf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 23.</NOTE> <HI>There are many Pro|babilities
<PB N="93" REF="94">
which are fal&s;e; and there are al&s;o many Improbabilities which are true</HI>. So I &s;hall be con|tent, that tho&s;e who are loth that all his va&s;t Reputation &s;hould &s;ink at once, reckon his Wickedne&s;s among the <HI>many Probabilities which they hope are fal&s;e</HI>; or his Sincerity among the <HI>many Improbabilities which they hope are true</HI>: Pro|vided they will allow all Chri&s;tians to go &s;o far by the Evidence which lies before them, as to have a watchful Eye over him, and never to tru&s;t him in any of the&s;e Matters, without &s;ome better Evidence hereafter. And if this Author thinks &s;uch an Innovator in Chri&s;tia|nity is to have his Reputation pre&s;erv'd as much as may be, I mu&s;t own my &s;elf, in Company with Chri&s;t, his Apo&s;tles, and all the fir&s;t Chri|&s;tians, of another Opinion; and that <HI>Simon Ma|gus, Cerinthus, Ba&s;ilides, Saturninus, Valentinus, Mar|cion, Marcellus, Athana&s;ius</HI>, and the like real He|reticks, are to be had in the utmo&s;t Dete&s;tation, by every true Di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And I am &s;ure if an Apo&s;tle him&s;elf would not pretend to <HI>have dominion over the Faith</HI> of Chri&s;tians, <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>, on all Accounts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. i.24.</NOTE> tho' he has long had it much more I think than any of the Apo&s;tles in the&s;e Matters, will not de|&s;erve to retain the lea&s;t Part of that <HI>Dominion</HI> hereafter.

<P>Before I conclude, as to this Premonition, give me leave to tran&s;cribe a Pa&s;&s;age out of an unknown, but not injudicious Author, highly worthy eve|ry
<PB N="94" REF="95">
hone&s;t Chri&s;tian's Con&s;ideration: For I own it a Pa&s;&s;age as to me very remarkable; tho' I never &s;aw the Book till very lately; &s;ince it contains another's earlier Di&s;covery of the Old Chri&s;tianity in the&s;e Points, by much the &s;ame hone&s;t Method whereby I di&s;cover'd the &s;ame thing afterward. 'Tis in the <HI>Vindication of the</HI> Unitarians, <HI>again&s;t a late Reverend Author on the Trinity</HI>; or again&s;t Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI>, printed <HI>A. D.</HI> 1690. <HI>pag.</HI> 11, 12. The Words are the&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;But lea&s;t any one &s;hould think, that the Do|ctrine of <HI>Plato</HI> &s;hould have the lea&s;t Influence in wre&s;ting the Scriptures to this Hypothe&s;is, I do hereby in the Pre&s;ence of God declare, what it was that fir&s;t mov'd my Judgment, and turn'd me to be an <HI>Arian</HI>; and if it did me, it &s;hould &endq;move us in Charity to think it did others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;An Acquaintance of mine, &s;peaking by chance of the Trinity, told me, Some thought it a Breach of the fir&s;t Commandment; and to convince me 'twas not reveal'd in the New Te&s;ta|ment, &s;hew'd me that mo&s;t notable Chapter of the Fir&s;t of the <HI>Hebrews</HI>: Now he little thought what he had done, when he did this; for tho' my Zeal boyl'd again&s;t his Bla&s;phemy, as I thought it for a time, yet when I reflected again with my &s;elf, I thought at lea&s;t his Di&s;cour&s;e had rais'd &s;uch Scruples in my Mind, that the very Con&s;iderablene&s;s of the fir&s;t Command|&endq;ment would nece&s;&s;itate me to enquire of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Now this was not only all the Di&s;cour&s;e I had with him, but I remember to this day, that I could never under&s;tand by his Di&s;cour&s;e, whe|ther he were <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI>, nor indeed what either Hypothe&s;is was; tho' lately, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, I have perceiv'd him rather enclin'd to the &endq;<HI>Socinians</HI>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96">
<Q>&startq;But thus it was, that &s;hortly after going for <HI>London</HI>, where my Doubt continuing upon me, I re&s;olv'd to give my &s;elf Satisfaction: I &s;ought for Books but found none; indeed I did not know what to enquire for; whereupon re&s;olv|ing to know that by my &s;elf, which I could not by others, without either knowing of <HI>Ariani&s;m, Socinian&s;m</HI>, or <HI>Platoni&s;m</HI>, I took this following &endq;Cour&s;e:</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I took the New Te&s;tament, where I conceiv'd this Truth was to be found reveal'd, if any where, and reading it with Attention, I col|lected every Text relating to Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, into an Imperial Sheet of Paper; for neither liking giddy Tradition, nor the Tricks of wre&s;ting &s;ingle Texts, I thought that this could be the only way to find the Truth by, &endq;if any.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Now God is my Witne&s;s, that when I did thus, I could not but fall into <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI>; not that I then knew what Name my Opinion had; but &s;ome time after meeting with Books, I &s;aw the difference of <HI>Ariani&s;m</HI> and <HI>Sociniani&s;m</HI>, and found that I was not &s;ingular in my Sentiments, but that the World had thought the &s;ame before &endq;me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Nor was this all, but before I knew that my Hypothe&s;is had been known to the World, thinking that I was &s;ingular in the Truth, I re|&s;olv'd in Charity to Mankind to publi&s;h my Di&s;covery, till &s;ome Friends hearing of it, ad|vis'd me to con&s;ider fir&s;t, that I might be as much blinded by my own Pride of Search, as the World was by their Corruption and Traditi|&endq;ons.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Upon this re&s;olving to be re&s;ign'd to Truth, and fearing le&s;t my Pre&s;umption might ruin me,
<PB N="96" REF="97">
I not only took all my Papers and burnt them, but re&s;olv'd to read all Books for the Trinity, and conver&s;e all Per&s;ons, and if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ati&s;|fy my &s;elf to believe, and acquie&s;ce in &s;o great &endq;a My&s;tery.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But alas, Sir, after all this Care, you &s;ee I am forc'd to differ from you; &s;o that tho' I could willingly lay by my Sentiments, the bet|ter to examine Truth for a-while, yet when on &s;earch I could &s;till do no otherwi&s;e, than think my Old Opinion the be&s;t; I dur&s;t not leave Truth for ever; and I hope the Nece&s;&s;ity of my Ca&s;e will at la&s;t induce you to a Charity for &endq;me.</Q></P>
<P>So far this Hone&s;t and Judicious Au|thor.</P>
<P>What I would propo&s;e to my Chri&s;tian and Impartial Readers Con&s;ideration, at the Con|clu&s;ion is this; that the weak Rea&s;onings and remote Deductions in the&s;e Authors are brought to &s;upport Doctrines confe&s;&s;edly above, if not contrary to the general Light of Nature, and the common Rea&s;on of Mankind; Doctrines that &s;eem at fir&s;t &s;ight to take away one of the fir&s;t Principles of Religion, natural and reveal'd; I mean the Unity of God, whereon the Patriarchal, <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>, and Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ati|ons are entirely built; Doctrines which there|fore, if true, ought certainly to have been mo&s;t plainly reveal'd, and undeniably deliver'd; Do|ctrines which have ever given &s;o great Offence and Scandal to the Unbelievers, whether <HI>Pagans, Jews, Mahometants</HI>; Doctrines that have been one grand Cau&s;e why Chri&s;tianity has &s;o little &s;pread over the re&s;t of the World &s;ince the three
<PB N="97" REF="98">
fir&s;t Centuries; nay, Doctrines which at this Day both hinder the &s;preading of the Go&s;pel in the very &s;ame Manner, and harden the Papi&s;ts in the parallel Ab&s;urdities of their Religion: In &s;hort, Doctrines that want the mo&s;t, and have the lea&s;t Evidence of almo&s;t all tho&s;e that belong to the Chri&s;tian In&s;titution.</P>
<P>Having now di&s;patch'd what I thought pro|per to &s;ay to the Author of the Premonition, and in general to both the&s;e Authors, I &s;hall add a few Things to the Author of the Con&s;i|derations di&s;tinctly; and &s;hall offer what I have to &s;ay in the Order his Con&s;iderations lye be|fore me.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place he thinks to enervate my &s;trong Proof from <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> again&s;t the Ra|tional Soul in Chri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ide|rations, <HI>or</HI> Remarks, p. 1, &amp;c&punc;</NOTE> as di&s;tinct from the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, by ob&s;erving that tho' in the place I quote <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> reckons up Three Parts of a Man, the Spirit, Soul, and Body, yet does he in the ve|ry &s;ame Di&s;cour&s;e directly affirm that Man is made up of <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body</HI>; without &s;aying a Syllable of the <HI>Spirit</HI>: And thence this Author concludes that the Spirit was, in <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI>'s Opi|nion, no proper Part of a Man, but an Influ|ence from the Spirit of God only. Now this is &s;aying what &s;erves the pre&s;ent turn, without &s;earching whether there be Truth at the Bot|tom or not. For had he done that, he would have perceiv'd that all his Foundation was wrong, and that the Ancient Chri&s;tians ever e&s;teem'd Man made up directly of tho&s;e three Parts; without dreaming that one of them was a bare Influence only: And that when <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> and others mention in general but Two, Soul
<PB N="98" REF="99">
and Body, they mean the &s;ame thing as when they enumerate all Three, Spirit, Soul and Bo|dy; becau&s;e the Sen&s;itive Soul is by them look'd upon as &s;till belonging to, or <HI>contain'd in</HI> the Body, as <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> &s;peaks; and by the <HI>Body</HI>, they do not mean a dead &s;en&s;ele&s;s Carca&s;e, but a living Body, with all its &s;en&s;itive Operations and Actions; or a Body with its &s;en&s;itive Soul; as this Author might, if he pleas'd, have learn'd from more Places than one of the &s;ame Book <HI>De Re&s;urrectione</HI>. But then to quote only &s;o late an Author as the Heathen Philo&s;opher <HI>Hierocles</HI>, to &s;hew the Ancient Chri&s;tian Notions about the Compo&s;ition of Man, is to little purpo&s;e; e&s;pecially when that Threefold Divi&s;ion is &s;o plain in the ancienter Sacred and Prophane Writers, Heathens, <HI>Jews</HI>, and Chri&s;tians; as I &s;hall &s;hew before my 15th Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">8, &amp;c.</NOTE>Then our Author proves that none of the Ancients could believe the Son's Pre|exi&s;tence to be <HI>in potentia</HI>, or other than real, before he was begotten or created, becau&s;e of the Ab&s;ur|dities and Contradictions of &s;uch an Hypothe|&s;is. Ju&s;t &s;o might he prove that the Papi&s;ts do not believe Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, or the Church the common Doctrine of the Trinity. I only a&s;&s;ert a Fact: And as I a&s;&s;ert it, &s;o it mo&s;t cer|tainly was; as I can evidently prove. Had I declar'd my own Opinion, he might have urg'd me with its Ab&s;urdity.

<PB N="99" REF="100">
hardly any Ab&s;urdity &s;o great, or Contradicti|on &s;o manife&s;t, but Mankind have been made firmly to believe them, nay to per&s;ecute others for not believing them, as well as them&s;elves; as he very well knows, without my Information. Tho' after all, I think the other Hypothe&s;is which our Author likes better, That our Lord was originally an Attribute in the Father, and was afterward created or begotten into a Per&s;on, is not much more intelligible; and &s;eems to me to want antienter and more &s;acred Authority, than what now appears for it among Chri&s;ti|ans. In plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>, I &s;u&s;pect its Derivation from &s;ome <HI>Prolations</HI> or <HI>Emi&s;&s;ions</HI> deriv'd from the Antient Hereticks, and unwarily entertain'd by &s;ome Philo&s;ophick Chri&s;tians in the latter Part of the Second Century. As to 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> V.7.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 13.</NOTE> and Dr. <HI>Mills</HI> Di&s;&s;ertation about it, my wonder is that when &s;o Learned a Per&s;on had produc'd the Evidence on both &s;ides, tho' giving much more than was real to the Text, and yet the Over-weight was &s;o plainly and va&s;tly again&s;t it, he &s;hould, after all, be able to per&s;uade him|&s;elf to &s;um up the Evidence in Favour of it. As I take it, that Di&s;&s;ertation has de&s;troy'd the Credit of this Ver&s;e with the truly Learned and Impartial already; and, when &s;ome Mi&s;takes are corrected, will do it with others al&s;o. It was the Examination of this Matter in that Di&s;&s;ertation, which &s;atisfy'd me that Text mu&s;t be given up as indefen&s;ible; which before I was not per&s;uaded of.</P>
<P>What follows next, to prove that the Three Di|vine Per&s;ons are <HI>One God</HI> in Scripture Language,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> XII.4, 5, 6. is &s;o very ab&s;urd, and &s;o contrary to the mo&s;t obvious Sen&s;e of the

Nor is that from <HI>Zech.</HI> XIII.7. where the Father &s;tiles the Son his <HI>Neighbour</HI>, or one <HI>Near</HI> to him, very much better. If &s;ome of our pre&s;ent Fundamental Doctrines cannot be more fully prov'd, I hope they will not long be e&s;teem'd Fundamental. As to <HI>Joh.</HI> V. and X.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 16, 17.</NOTE> I am not much concern'd what unju&s;t Impu|tations the <HI>Jews</HI>, our Lord's Enemies, lay'd on him from his Words, as if he claim'd to be pro|perly <HI>God</HI>, or <HI>equal to God</HI>, or rather to <HI>act origanally as God</HI>.

<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 40, 41 &amp; 51, &amp;c</NOTE> I am glad that this Author gives up that <HI>Samene&s;s</HI> or <HI>Equality</HI> of the Son to the Father, which <HI>Origen</HI> &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome <HI>ra&s;h</HI> Chri|&s;tians to have a&s;&s;erted in his Time. I hope the equally <HI>ra&s;h</HI> Chri&s;tians of our Times, will ob&s;erve this Conce&s;&s;ion, and begin, with the&s;e Authors, not to be offended with my Do|ctrines, That the Father is <HI>greater</HI> than the Son, and the Son <HI>le&s;s</HI> than, as well as <HI>inferior</HI> and <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> to the Father; as they have &s;o long been. Only I beg, that the &s;ame Authors, who yield this <HI>Inferiority</HI> becau&s;e they cannot avoid the <HI>Evidence</HI> for the &s;ame, will not a&s;&s;ert an <HI>Equality of Nature and Sub&s;tance</HI>, till they have &s;ome tolerable Evidence for the &s;ame al&s;o; which yet I take to be really none at all. For that is my Ob&s;ervation, So far as Evidence goes, the&s;e Authors own <HI>Inferiority</HI>; but where they have no Evidence, they a&s;&s;ert <HI>Equa|lity</HI>.</P>
<P>I know not what to &s;ay to this Author's Ac|count of <HI>Cerinthus</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 41, 42 43.</NOTE> and to the Impa&s;&s;ibility of the Divine Nature of Chri&s;t, when Incarnate; becau&s;e I can &s;ay little to the purpo&s;e, without Tran&s;cribing large and numerous Te&s;timonies out of my foremention'd Papers. But this Au|thor picks up one or two Pa&s;&s;ages, and omits the re&s;t, and &s;o makes a &s;hew of &s;aying &s;ome|what again&s;t me. When the Reader has &s;een all that I have on that Head, I will leave it to his own Judgment, whether the common Do|ctrine be not a plain Part of the Here&s;y of <HI>Ce|rinthus</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="103" MS="Y"><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 43, &amp;c.</NOTE>As to the Holy Gho&s;t, that he was never called <HI>God</HI> by the Ancients, nor was ever by them <HI>invocated</HI>, I find many of the Learned grant it me; and begin to wi&s;h, that the pre|&s;ent Church obliged to no &s;uch Denomination, or Invocation of him. Nor has this Author &s;aid any thing con&s;iderable upon this Head, but only introduced <HI>$aeus</HI> as on the Side of the&s;e Corruptions, which, of almo&s;t all the Ancients he is mo&s;t evidently again&s;t; as will appear in due place. Sure Divine Wor&s;hip ought to &s;tand on firmer Grounds than this &s;ort of Rea&s;oning; or el&s;e we may Invocate what Beings we plea&s;e, and yet never want To|picks to ju&s;tify what we do.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 53.</NOTE>I wi&s;h this Author had di&s;tinctly told us, whether he owns that the Divine Nature of our Saviour was really ignorant of the Day of Judgment, or not: As, I think, all the Ancients under&s;tood the Texts here referr'd to; even <HI>Irenaeus</HI> him&s;elf. For if this be once yielded, I count the main Di&s;pute is at an End. And as for my &s;elf, I do always look upon the&s;e Texts as &s;o plain and undoubted, that I e&s;teem all the Te&s;timonies which the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> have ever alledg'd for their Notions, not to be equivalent to a &s;mall Part of the Evidence thence ari&s;ing for the <HI>Arians</HI>: And that therefore all the other Texts and Te&s;timonies for them, are <HI>ex abun|danti</HI>, and directly <HI>&s;upernumerary</HI>.</P>
<P>As to the &s;mall Varieties between the Ac|counts in the Go&s;pels and that in the <HI>Con&s;titu|tions</HI>, as to our Saviour's Pa&s;&s;ion, I ju&s;tly in&s;i&s;t upon it, that they ought to weigh no more
<PB N="103" REF="104">
than the like &s;mall Varieties among the Four Go&s;pels them&s;elves. And I venture to a&s;&s;ure this Author, that upon my Examination and Compari&s;on of the Particulars, I take the <HI>Con|&s;titutions</HI> to be &s;till the mo&s;t authentick and ex|act; and that the pre&s;ent Copies of the Go|&s;pels are rather to be corrected by them, than the contrary. I &s;ay, the <HI>pre&s;ent Copies</HI> only: For there is great Rea&s;on to think, that not a few of tho&s;e &s;eeming Contradictions are not Original, but owing wholly to the later Tran|&s;cribers and Interpolators. And indeed, in this very point, I take that Order of a Ver&s;e or two in St. <HI>John</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John XVIII.13.24.</NOTE> which at once contradicts him&s;elf and the re&s;t of the Evangeli&s;ts, to be the pro|per Occa&s;ion of this &s;eeming Contradiction; and that when St. <HI>John</HI>'s Go&s;pel is re&s;tor'd to its Primitive State in this Matter, it will exactly agree with the&s;e <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI>. But this is not a proper place to enlarge upon that Point.</P>
<P>After this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 55, 56.</NOTE> the Author appears plainly to be apprehen&s;ive that my Te&s;timonies for the <HI>Ari|ans</HI> will be too hard for tho&s;e to be produc'd for the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI>; becau&s;e 'tis certain, that the Sacred and mo&s;t Ancient Writers &s;ay that Chri&s;t was not only voluntarily <HI>begotten</HI>, but really <HI>created</HI> by God, a little before the <HI>Mo|&s;aick</HI> Creation; which but ill agrees with his <HI>Coeternity</HI> with the Father. Upon this Occa&s;ion, we have an Hypothe&s;is advanc'd concerning the differing Modes of the Words <HI>Sub&s;i&s;tence</HI>, before and after that Generation or Creation. This is a Philo&s;ophical Suppo&s;ition, without any direct Proof in the Sacred and mo&s;t An|cient Books of our Religion. Nay, it rather &s;eems to me to be contrary to them. For Ex|ample:
<PB N="104" REF="105">
<HI>Hermas</HI> &s;ays, the Angels were <HI>fir&s;t crea|ted</HI>; and not very many Lines after, he &s;ays of the Divine Nature of our Saviour, that it was <HI>fir&s;t of all created</HI>. Now, to interpret <HI>created</HI> in the former Ca&s;e, of the bringing that into Be|ing, which was not in Being before; and in the Second, of only &s;uch an <HI>Emi&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>Prola|tion</HI>, as &s;uppo&s;ed the Per&s;on <HI>created</HI> to have been in Being <HI>before his Creation</HI>, &s;eems to me &s;o &s;trange, that to believe it at all is hard enough; but without any Sacred Evidence to believe it as a Fundamental Article of Faith, and thence to draw the Coeternity of our Sa|viour; nay, thence to make that Coeternity a Fundamental Article al&s;o, &s;eems to me utterly ab&s;urd and unju&s;tifiable. When therefore I &s;ee this Mode of Sub&s;i&s;tence of the Word be|fore his Creation prov'd by plain Texts or Te&s;timonies earlier than <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI>, I will believe it as a Part of my Chri&s;tian Faith; but till then, I &s;hall e&s;teem it rather as a Branch of the Uncertain Philo&s;ophy of &s;ome Ancient Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>As indeed, That is the proper Rule I go by in the&s;e important Affairs; when in tracing up any Ancient Chri&s;tian Opinions I am forc'd to &s;top at &s;ome Chri&s;tian Philo&s;ophers, and can find no Evidence &s;o high as <HI>Polycarp</HI>, I then note the Notions for Points of uncertain Chri|&s;tian Philo&s;ophy, and do not admit them to be certain Articles of Chri&s;tian Faith: As in|deed, the Maintainers of them do never, that I remember, in that ca&s;e pretend them to be otherwi&s;e. Tho' I confe&s;s, I do not pre&s;ently &s;ay, that they therefore are all fal&s;e, and to be wholly rejected; but I let them lye in the &s;ame uncertain State wherein I find them; which
<PB N="105" REF="106">
if the Church had done in all its latter Ages, we had not had Creeds, Articles and Liturgies, &s;o full of the uncertain Philo&s;ophy of Chri&s;ti|ans: Which it is therefore high time to re|view, and to reduce all to the Primitive Standard and Simplicity. But this by the way.</P>
<P>As to what Excu&s;es and Apologies the Au|thor makes for <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 57, &amp;c.</NOTE> they are &s;o very weak, and faintly made, that I believe he is not much different from the Mind of his Friend, the Author of the <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI>: &s;o I &s;hall not repeat what I have before &s;aid upon that Occa|&s;ion. If we entirely believe all that the <HI>Atha|na&s;ians</HI> have &s;aid for him, we may hope he was not a great Knave; but if not, he cannot be ju&s;tified; and there I leave that Matter.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o &s;aid what I thought proper as to <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI>, and <HI>Theogno&s;tus</HI>, and the Spuriou&s;ne&s;s of the former's pretended Letter, in my Second Reply to Dr. <HI>Allix</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 20, 21, 22.</NOTE> and &s;hall not repeat it. Only I mu&s;t de&s;ire all that may at any time have a mind to vindicate the <HI>A|thana&s;ian</HI> Doctrines, that they omit tho&s;e Cita|tions from the Ancients, which wholly depend on <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>'s Te&s;timony, hereafter; becau&s;e they will weigh nothing at all with me, and, I believe, not very much with others neither; excepting &s;uch &s;tanch <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI>, as need no Arguments, but are already &s;atisfy'd in their Faith in the&s;e Matters, without farther Exa|mination.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="107" MS="Y"><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 75, &amp;c.</NOTE>To come now to the <HI>Appendix</HI>: Where, <HI>Numb.</HI> I. this Author aims to prove, That the <HI>Jews</HI> expected their Me&s;&s;ias to be <HI>God</HI>.

But even this &s;eems to me very uncertain; becau&s;e the Que&s;tion which our Lord put to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matthew XXII.42, &mdash; 46.</NOTE> How Chri&s;t, who was to be the <HI>Son of David</HI>, could be call'd <HI>his Lord?</HI> &s;o utterly &s;ilenc'd them: Which it could not certainly have done, if they had expected their Me&s;&s;iah to be really God, as this Au|thor pretends. And that the Term, <HI>Son of God</HI>, had then any &s;uch Notion included in it, as this Author &s;uppo&s;es, I am by no means &s;ati&s;|fy'd. Nor is there any Foot&s;teps of it in the Books of the New Te&s;tament. Indeed, the Word <HI>Only-begotten</HI>, did in the Chri&s;tian &s;en&s;e imply more than <HI>Son</HI>; tho' not at all what the <HI>Athana|&s;ians</HI> would &s;ain draw from it. But that any of the&s;e Words imply any proper <HI>Samene&s;s</HI> or <HI>E|quality</HI> with the Supreme God, is without all ju&s;t Foundation in the World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 82, &amp;c.</NOTE>What is &s;aid next, as to the Son's being cal|led <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> comes to this, that he his call'd <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts</HI>, and that the LXX. &s;ometimes render the &s;ame Epithet <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, therefore. If I &s;hould Rea&s;on thus, I know what Opini|on the Orthodox would have of me. But a &s;mall Argument for what we de&s;ire pa&s;&s;es ea&s;ily for a great one. Yet I mu&s;t do the Author the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay he has yielded me more than &s;ome would de&s;ire, when he here owns, that

<P>But then to think of making <HI>Joh.</HI> XVII.3.<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 84, &amp;c.</NOTE> &s;erve his Purpo&s;e is very gro&s;s: And I do but de&s;ire the Reader, after he has read this Author's Colours, to read the Ver&s;e over again calmly by him&s;elf, and then judge whether it does not plainly a&s;|&s;ert that the Father, as di&s;tinct from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the <HI>Only True God</HI>. If there were but one Text &s;o plain for the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> as this is for the <HI>Ari|rians</HI>, I &s;hould be in no &s;mall pain, notwith|&s;tanding the Strength of the Evidence el&s;e|where for them. I wi&s;h the&s;e remote Com|ments were let alone, and the hone&s;t Chri&s;tian were permitted to learn the Doctrine of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles from the plain Words of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, as the fir&s;t Converts did. I know what would be the Con&s;equence of this. Nor are the <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> unappriz'd of it: And therefore are they &s;o full of their Notes and Comments on all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The next Number is built upon an Ambigui|ty of the Word <HI>God</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 87, &amp;c.</NOTE> that <HI>no God could be formed after God the Father</HI>: Therefore Chri&s;t is Eternal. Right; no Original Eternal God can ever be form'd. But yet all the other Gods, true or fal&s;e, if they were at all real, were <HI>form'd</HI>, and that <HI>after God the Father</HI> al&s;o: As this Author very well knows. And till he proves more than he has yet done, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t may be, in an inferior Sen&s;e, <HI>God</HI>, and yet <HI>formed</HI> or <HI>created</HI> by the Father, as were the Angels, Ma|gi&s;trates,

<P>And now it was, and indeed not till now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;torical Preface, pag. 7.</NOTE> that I had all my Evidence at once before me, and that I was able to affirm, and a&s;&s;uredly pronounce, that the <HI>Arian</HI> Doctrine was in the&s;e Points (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Trinity</HI> and <HI>Incarnation</HI>, as in <HI>Pag.</HI> 6.) mo&s;t certainly the Original Do|ctrine of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, of his Holy Apo&s;tles, and of the mo&s;t Primitive Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>When the Scriptures &s;peak of One God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preface, pag 81, 82.</NOTE> they mean thereby One Supreme God the Father only.</P>
<P>The Moderns called the&s;e Three Divine Per|&s;ons but One God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid</NOTE> and &s;o introduc'd at lea&s;t a new, and un&s;criptural and inaccurate, if not a fal&s;e way of &s;peaking into the Church.</P>

<P>The&s;e I allow to be mine own Words, and to be agreeable to my own, not uncertain Opi|nion, but certain Faith. I was once, as the World will &s;ee by the Occa&s;ion of the latter <HI>Er|ratum</HI>, in the Common Opinion, that the Fa|ther, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, the Three Divine Per&s;ons were truly, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, <HI>One God</HI>, or <HI>the One God</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Religion: That is before I particularly examin'd that Matter in the Scriptures, and the mo&s;t Primitive Writers. But &s;ince I have throughly enquir'd into it, I am &s;o fully &s;atisfy'd that the <HI>Father</HI> alone is the <HI>One
<PB N="114" REF="114" MS="Y">
God</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Religion&punc; that I mu&s;t now own, that when once I deny or doubt of that Doctrine I mu&s;t deny or doubt of our common Chri&s;tianity: There being no one Article more plain, or more univer&s;ally acknowledg'd in all the fir&s;t Ages of the Church than that was.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preface, pag. 28.</NOTE>Since Your Lord&s;hip is &s;o throughly &s;en&s;ible of the Antichri&s;tiani&s;m of Popery, I would fain know how the <HI>Con&s;ub&s;tantiality</HI> and <HI>Coequality</HI> of the Holy Gho&s;t to the Father and the Son, on which &s;oon followed his <HI>Invocation</HI>, which only &s;tands upon <HI>one Letter</HI> of Pope <HI>Liberius</HI> or <HI>Dama&s;us</HI>, can by Your Lord&s;hip be look'd on under any other Denomination.</P>

<P>I allow that the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit is to be wor|&s;hip'd in tho&s;e Forms [<HI>viz.</HI> Bapti&s;m,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pref. pag. 46.</NOTE> Doxo|logy and Ble&s;&s;ing] but never by <HI>Invocation</HI>.</P>

<Q><P>WE do declare, That the abovemention'd Pa&s;&s;ages, cited out of the Books of <HI>William Whi&s;ton,</HI> do contain A&s;&s;ertions Fal&s;e and He|retical, Injurious to our Saviour and the Holy Spirit, Repugnant to the Holy Scriptures, and Contrariant to <HI>the Decrees of the Two fir&s;t

General Councils,</HI> and to <HI>the Liturgy and Articles of our Church</HI>.</P>
<P>And we do earne&s;tly be&s;eech all Christian People, by the Mercies of Chri&s;t, to take heed how they give ear to the&s;e Fal&s;e Doctrines, as they tender the Honour and Glory of our Saviour, and the Holy Spirit, the Pre&s;erva|tion of the Purity of the Go&s;pel, and the Peace of the Church.</P>
<P>And whereas the &s;aid <HI>William Whi&s;ton,</HI> the better to &s;upport his Heretical Opinions, &s;peaking of a Book commonly call'd the <HI>Apo|&s;tolical Con&s;titutions,</HI> hath the&s;e Words,</P></Q>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pref. pag. 85.</NOTE>I have, I think, certainly found that tho&s;e <HI>Apo&s;to|lical Con&s;titutions</HI> which the Antichri&s;tian Church has &s;o long laid a&s;ide as &s;purious or heretical, are no other than the Original Laws and Doctrines of the Go&s;pel: The <HI>New Covenant</HI>; or mo&s;t &s;a|cred Standard of Chri&s;tianity; equal in their Authority to the Four Go&s;pels them&s;elves; and Superior in Authority to the Epi&s;tles of &s;ingle Apo&s;tles: Some Parts of them being our Savi|our's own <HI>Original Laws</HI> deliver'd to the Apo|&s;tles; and the other Parts the <HI>Publick Acts</HI> of the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves met in Councils at <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;area</HI> before their Death: And this was the con&s;tant Opinion and Te&s;timony of the earlie&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><HI>We cannot but declare this A&s;&s;ertion advanced concerning a Book, which was never yet ac|knowledged
