<L>AN antient &s;age, when death approach'd his bed,</L>
<L>Con&s;ign'd to Pluto his devoted head;</L>
<L>And, that no fiend might hi&s;s, or prove uncivil,</L>
<L>With vows and pray'rs he fairly brib'd the Devil:</L>
<L>Yet neither vows nor pray'rs, nor rich oblation,</L>
<L>Cou'd always &s;ave the &s;inner&mdash;from damnation.</L>
<L>Thus authors, tottering on the brink of fate:</L>
<L>The critick's rage with prologues deprecate;</L>
<L>Yet oft the trembling bard implores in vain,</L>
<L>The wit profe&s;s'd, turns out a dunce in grain:</L>
<L>No plea can then avert the dreadful &s;entence,</L>
<L>He mu&s;t be damn'd&mdash;in &s;pite of all repentance.</L>
<L>Here ju&s;tice &s;eems from her &s;traight line to vary,</L>
<L>No guilt attends a fact involuntary;</L>
<L>This maxim the whole cruel charge de&s;troys,</L>
<L>No Poet &s;ure was ever dull&mdash;by choice.</L>
<L>So pleads our Culprit in his own defence,</L>
<L>You cannot prove his dullne&s;s is&mdash;prepen&s;e.</L>

<L>Replete with a variety of flavours:</L>
<L>A &s;tout Hibernian, and ferocious Scot,</L>
<L>Together boil in our inchanted pot;</L>
<L>To taint the&s;e viands with the true fumet,</L>
<L>He &s;hreds a mu&s;ty, vain, French&mdash;martinet.</L>
<L>This &s;tale ingredient might our porridge ma$r</L>
<L>Without &s;ome acid juice of Engli&s;h tar.</L>
<L>To rou&s;e the appetite the drum &s;hall rattle,</L>
<L>And the de&s;ert &s;hall be a bloodle&s;s battle.</L>
<L>What heart will fail to glow, what eye to brighten,</L>
<L>When Britain's wrath arrous'd begins to lighten!</L>
<L>Her thunders roll&mdash;her fearle&s;s &s;ons advance,</L>
<L>And her red en&s;igns wave o'er the pale flow'rs of France.</L>
<L>Such game our fathers play'd in days of yore,</L>
<L>When Edward's banners fann'd the Gallick &s;hore;</L>
<L><PB REF="3">
When Howard's arm Eliza's vengeance hurl'd,</L>
<L>And Drake diffus'd her fame around the world:</L>
<L>Still &s;hall that God-like flame your bo&s;oms fire,</L>
<L>The gen'rous &s;on &s;hall emulate the $ire;</L>

<P>WELL, if this be taking diver&s;ion on the

ground! and if ever I come in &s;ight of
the Sea again, may a watry grave be my portion.&mdash;Fir&s;t,
to be terrified with the thoughts of
drowning&mdash;Secondly, to be to&s;&s;ed and tumbled
about like a foot-ball&mdash;Thirdly, to be drenched
with Sea-water&mdash;Fourthly, to be &s;tunk to death
with pitch and tar and the &s;avoury &s;cent of my

<P>Enough!&mdash;aye, and to &s;pare&mdash;I wi&s;h I could
give part to tho&s;e who envy my good fortune&mdash;
But, how will the good Lady Bloomwell moralize
when &s;he finds her daughter Mi&s;s Harriet is fallen
into the hands of Mon&s;ieur de Champignon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more&mdash;that reflection alarms me!&mdash;yet I
have nothing to fear&mdash;as there is no war declared,
we &s;hall &s;oon be relea&s;ed: and in the mean time
the French will treat us with their u&s;ual polite|ne&s;s.</P>

<P>Pox on their politene&s;s! ah ma&s;ter! commend
me to the blunt &s;incerity of the true &s;urly Briti&s;h
ma&s;tiff&mdash;The ra&s;$allion that took my pur&s;e
bowed &s;o low, and paid me &s;o many compliments,
that I ventured to argue the matter in hopes of
convincing him he was in the wrong&mdash;but he &s;oon
&s;topped my mouth with a vengeance, by clapping
a cocked pi&s;tol to my ear, and telling me he &s;hould
have the honour to blow my brains out&mdash;Another
of tho&s;e polite gentlemen begged leave to ex|change
hats with me&mdash;A third fell in love with
my &s;ilver &s;hoe-buckles&mdash;Nay, that very individual
nice buttock of beef, which I had ju&s;t begun to
&s;urvey with looks of de&s;ire, after the di&s;mal eva|cuation
I had undergone, was ravi&s;hed from my
&s;ight by two fami&s;hed French wolves, who beheld
it with equal joy and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>

the commander did not keep his hands
clear of the pillage&mdash;An in&s;tance of rapaciou&s;ne&s;s

an officer.&mdash;Sure he will behave as &s;uch to
Harriet!</P>

<SPEAKER>BRUSH.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith! not to flatter you, Sir, I take him to be
one of tho&s;e fellows who owe their good fortune
to nothing le&s;s than their good works&mdash;He fir&s;t
rifled your mi&s;tre&s;s, and then made love to her
with great gallantry&mdash;but you was in the right to
call your&s;elf her brother&mdash;if he knew you were
his rival you might pa&s;s your time very di&s;agree|ably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are two officers on board, who &s;eem to
di&s;approve of his conduct; they would not be
concerned in robbing us, nor would they &s;uffer
their &s;oldiers to take any &s;hare of the prey, but
condoled Harriet and me on our misfortune, with
marks of real concern.</P>

<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oclabber I knew at Paris, when I travelled with
my brother, and he then bore the character of an
hone&s;t man and a brave officer&mdash;The other is an
Highlander, excluded (I &s;uppo&s;e) from his own
country on account of the late rebellion; for that
rea&s;on, perhaps, more apt to pity the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;
I &s;ee them walking this way in clo&s;e conference&mdash;

Harriet, you may lounge about and endeavour to

<P>I was indeed terribly alarmed when a cannon
&s;hot came whi&s;tling over our heads; and not a

but, I imagine all danger dimini&s;hes, or at lea&s;t
lo&s;es part of its terror, the nearer you approach it:
and as for this Champignon, he is &s;uch a con|temptible
fellow, that upon recollection, I almo&s;t
de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf for having been afraid of him.&mdash;
O'my con&s;cience! I believe all courage is acquired

&s;hook me by the hand, though I

in order to clinch my remon&s;trance, told him
that my ma&s;ter's great grandmother's aunt was

<P>Don't be afraid, Frenchman&mdash;you &s;ee I have
hoi&s;ted your jacket, thof I &s;truck your en&s;ign&mdash;
we Engli&s;hmen never cut throats in cold blood:
the be&s;t way of beating the French is to &s;pare all
their Shampinions&mdash;Odd's heart! I wou'd all
their commanders were of your trim, brother;
we'd &s;oon have the French navy at Spithead.</P>

<P>Lubber!&mdash;Man and boy, twenty years in
the &s;ervice&mdash;lubber!&mdash;Ben Block was the
man that taught thee, Tom Lyon, to hand, reef,
and &s;teer&mdash;&s;o much for the &s;ervice of old Eng|land&mdash;But
go thy ways, Ben, thy timbers are
crazy, thy planks are &s;tarted, and thy bottom is
foul&mdash;I have &s;een the day when thou would'&s;t
have &s;hewn thy colours with the be&s;t o'un.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIET.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come Mr. Block, I mu&s;t make you friends with
lieutenant Lyon&mdash;As he has been your pupil,
he mu&s;t be an able navigator; and this is no time
for our able &s;eamen to fall out among them&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BLOCK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look ye here, mi&s;tre&s;s, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, as
how, he's as bri&s;k a &s;eaman as ever greas'd a mar|lin&s;pike&mdash;I'll turn 'un a drift with e'er a he that
ever ree&s;ed a fore&s;ail&mdash;A will fetch up his $ee|way
with a wet &s;ail, as the &s;aying is&mdash;and as
for my own part, d'ye &s;ee, I have &s;tood by him
with my blood&mdash;and my heart&mdash;and my liver,
in all weathers&mdash;blow high&mdash;blow low.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAMPIGNON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Lionne, I ave not altogether contradict|ed,
but, perhaps, a littel exceeded my ordres, wich
were to take one Engli&s;h chaloupe for intelligence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;I'm per&s;uaded Mr. Lyon will not be
very &s;evere in his &s;crutiny; and, to &s;hew that we
Engli&s;hmen can forgive injuries, and fight without
malice, give me your hand&mdash;I can't part with
my mi&s;tre&s;s; but in other re&s;pects I am Mon&s;ieur
de Champignon's humble &s;ervant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was once taken by the French, who u&s;ed me
nobly.&mdash;I'm a witne&s;s of their valour, and an
in&s;tance of their politene&s;s&mdash;but there are
Champignon's in every &s;ervice&mdash;While France
u&s;es us like friends, we will return her civili$ies:
when &s;he breaks her treaties and grows in&s;olent,
we will drub her over to her good behaviour&mdash;
Jack Haulyard, you have got a long to the purpo&s;e,
that won't, I believe, be di&s;agreeable to the com|pany.</P>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Mi&s;s MACKLIN.</BYLINE>
<L>AYE&mdash;now I can with plea&s;ure look around,</L>
<L>Safe as I am, thank Heaven, on Engli&s;h ground.&mdash;</L>
<L>In a dark dungeon to be &s;tow'd away,</L>
<L>Mid&s;t roaring, th$nd'ring, danger and di&s;may:</L>
<L>Expos'd to fire and water, &s;word and bullet&mdash;</L>
<L>Might damp the heart of any Virgin pullet.&mdash;</L>
<L>I dread to think what might have come to pa&s;s,</L>
<L>Had not the Briti&s;h Lyon quell'd the Gallic A&s;s&mdash;</L>
<L>By Champignon a wretched victim led</L>
<L>To cloi&s;ter'd cell, or more dete&s;ted bed.</L>
<L>My days in pray'r and fa&s;ting I had &s;pent:</L>
<L>A$ nun, or wife, alike a penitent.</L>
<L>His gallantry, &s;o confident and eager,</L>
<L>Had prov'd a me&s;s of delicate &s;oupe&mdash;maigre.</L>
<L>To bootle&s;s longings I had fallen a martyr:</L>
<L>But, Heav'n be prais'd, the Frenchman caught a Tartar.</L>
<L>Yet &s;oft&mdash;our author's fate you mu&s;t decree:</L>
<L>Shall he come &s;afe to port, or &s;ink at &s;ea?</L>
<L>Your &s;entence, &s;weet or bitter, &s;oft or &s;ore,</L>
<L>Floats his frail bark, or runs it bump a&s;hore.&mdash;</L>
<L>Ye wits above re&s;train your awful thunder:</L>
<L>In his fir&s;t crui&s;e, 'twere pity he &s;hould founder.</L>
<STAGE>[To the gall.</STAGE>
<L>Safe from your &s;hot he fears no other foe,</L>
<L>Nor gulph, but that which horrid yawns below.</L>
<STAGE>[To the pit.</STAGE>
<L>The brave&s;t chiefs, ev'n Hannibal and Cato,</L>
<L>Have here been tam'd with&mdash;pippin and potatoe.</L>
<L>Our hard embarks in a more chri&s;tian cau&s;e,</L>
<L>He craves not mercy; but he claims applau&s;e.</L>
<L>His pen again&s;t the ho&s;tile French is drawn,</L>
<L>Who damns him, is no Antigallican.</L>
<L>Indulg'd with fav'ring gales and &s;miling &s;kies,</L>
<L>Hereafter he may board a richer prize.</L>
<L>But if this welkin angry clouds deform,</L>
<STAGE>[Looking round the hou&s;e.</STAGE>
<L>And hollow groans portend the approaching &s;torm:</L>
<L>Should the de&s;cending &s;how'rs of hail redouble,</L>
<STAGE>[To the gall.</STAGE>
<L>And the&s;e rough billows hi&s;s, and boil and bubble,</L>
<STAGE>[To the pit.</STAGE>
<L>H$'ll launch no more $n &s;uch fell &s;eas of trouble.</L>
