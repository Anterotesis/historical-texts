<HEAD>TO THE Right Hon. LORD THURLOW, LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD, or may it plea&s;e your Lord&s;hip,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Need not acquaint your Lord&s;hip, that a Publication without a Dedi|cation is as great a Phaenomenon as a Mini&s;ter without Power, a Peer with|out Principle, a Bi&s;hop without Learn|ing, or a Maid of Honor without Cha&s;tity; and that it &s;tands as little chance of a favourable reception, as a Candidate for a Place, who carries with him no other recommendation than Integrity and Capability.&mdash;Every one who re&s;orts to the pre&s;s, whether in the character of Author, Editor, or
<PB N="vi" REF="4">Compiler, decorates his Fronti&s;piece with &s;ome illu&s;trious name or other, and catches at that opportunity of of|fering incen&s;e to the God of his ido|latry.&mdash;One does it from motives of avarice, to &s;queeze from the vain and credulous a few of his &s;uperfluous guineas&mdash;A &s;econd, from motives of &s;ecurity, &s;hrewdly concluding that the re&s;pect &s;pontaneou&s;ly and implicitly given to great-per&s;onages, will protect his Works from the Teeth of Envy, Malignity, and Critici&s;m.&mdash;A third, from Vanity, to prove that he can|not be nobody, &s;ince he has the honor of knowing &s;omebody.&mdash;A fourth, from the mo&s;t laudable motives, to hold up for imitation to the <HI>Belle Monde</HI> a &s;ample of conjugal Fidelity, and to let their Lady&s;hips &s;ee, that a woman may ri&s;e above the re&s;t of her &s;ex, without ruining her hu&s;band, and gain admiration without lo&s;ing her reputation.&mdash;And a fifth (to go no fur|ther) from Gratitude, to do homage
<PB N="vii" REF="5">to his patron, and to offer him his warme&s;t tribute of thanks, the only recompence in his power, for twice ten thou&s;and favours conferred upon him.&mdash;Thus ****, and many a poor devil of a garretteer have had their dupe in N&mdash;d. Thus, Sir Wil|liam Chambers looked for a buckler in Maje&s;ty&mdash;Thus, before he was Secre|tary to the Board of Trade, had Cum|berland his Grafton.&mdash;Thus, had Ditto his Model in the prudent and cha&s;te Manche&s;ter:&mdash;and thus do I pique my&s;elf upon having my Apollo, my Maecenas, <HI>magnis editus regibus,</HI> my <HI>proe&s;idium &amp; dulce decus</HI> in the mo&s;t noble and accompli&s;hed Lord Thur|low. Mo&s;t noble and accompli&s;hed indeed! I challenge all the biogra|phers in Chri&s;tendom to name me a man from Adam down to the inge|nious Mr. Pinchbeck, that can touch the heel of your Lord&s;hip's &s;hoe, ei|ther as the State&s;man, the Orator, or the Gentleman. Be&s;ides that you are a
<PB N="viii" REF="6">limb of the ancient and hereditary peerage (which by the way mu&s;t be a matter of con&s;iderable con&s;olation in the&s;e days, when it is &s;o fa&s;hionable to tilt at tho&s;e Lords who are not &s;uch, and to twit them in the teeth with being up&s;tarts, creatures of the day, tools of power, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.) I &s;ay, my Lord, that be&s;ides this, it is well known your Lord&s;hip is Keeper of the K&mdash;'s Con&s;cience, and the great Atlas of the &s;tate: nor is it le&s;s noto|rious, or le&s;s generally acknowledged, that you are the Paragon of Ta&s;te, the Pink of Courte&s;y, and Te&s;t of Ele|gance.</P>
<P>Here, my Lord, I mu&s;t take the liberty which dedications tolerate, of touching upon that generous concern for your country, which influences every action your life; and on that candor, &s;incerity, complacency of manners, and winning conde&s;cen&s;ion which di&s;tingui&s;h your debate, and &s;e|cure to you the admiration and e&s;teem
<PB N="ix" REF="7">of all your hearers; and in doing this, I have no intentions of treading the beaten track and comparing you to Demo&s;thenes or Cicero. To in&s;inuate that you ever had a type or parallel, is to derogate from your <HI>peerle&s;s</HI> endow|ments. No, my Lord, you are your|&s;elf, an Original, an Archetype, a Non&s;uch.</P>
<P>I am aware that this language will offend one who has in <HI>an hundred in|&s;tances</HI> betrayed an aver&s;ion to applau&s;e, tho' he is for ever de&s;erving it; but, my Lord, for once your delicacy and humility mu&s;t be di&s;appointed. I can|not bring my&s;elf to &s;acrifice my gra|tifications to your wi&s;hes, and give up the plea&s;ure I am &s;ure to receive in doing you homage, only becau&s;e you are too mode&s;t to receive your due. In vain do you bid me be &s;ilent; I can no more check my gratitude than your Lord&s;hip can your genero&s;ity; and only when you cea&s;e to de&s;erve prai&s;e, &s;hall I be able to with-hold it.</P>
<PB N="x" REF="8">
<P>Thus much for what I had to ad|dre&s;s per&s;onally to your Lord&s;hip. As to the following Sheets, which by be|ing honored with your kind patron|age, are now to partake of your im|mortality, what I have to communi|cate about them, will perhaps appear with more propriety, and a better grace in an Adverti&s;ement to the can|did Public, for who&s;e future behoof, and not as a trap for reputation or pro|motion, I &s;end them to the Pre&s;s.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor of being, as ever, MY LORD, Your Lord&s;hip's devoted, and grateful humble Servant, A SENATOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>MINISTERS, like other men, have their pa&s;&s;ions, and their filles de joie; and the&s;e filles de joie, like tho&s;e of an in|ferior cla&s;s, will &s;ometimes play their keepers fal&s;e. It was to this infidelity that I am in|debted for the di&s;covery of certain mens po|litics.&mdash;About a fortnight &s;ince, a valet of mine (a &s;mart, young Iri&s;hman) in one of his twilight &s;aunters in the Park, was ac|co&s;ted by Mrs. Harvey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lady will be better known perhaps by the name of Poll H&mdash;es.</NOTE>; and after a &s;hort preliminary or two, conducted to her apart|ments in G&mdash;t O&mdash;d Street. It &s;eems that &s;he had heard that the Iri&s;h &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all other nations in gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es, and &s;ecretly re&s;olved to embrace the fir&s;t moment of put|ting their boa&s;ted pre-eminence to the te&s;t. Her keeper, Lord Churllow, happily was at that period in the country; and a more fa|vourable one &s;he never could look for: &s;he &s;eized the golden opportunity, and was con|vinced that the pre-eminence was more than imaginary. The fellow, &s;he naturally con|cluded,
<PB N="12" REF="10">would expect a recompence for his trouble; and her pur&s;e was in&s;tantly tendered, but, with the true &s;pirit of an Iri&s;hman, he &s;corned to receive wages from the Fair, and begged to be excu&s;ed. His di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s charmed the lady, and determined her to &s;e|cure his further acquaintance. "I cannot think (cried &s;he) of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing you without &s;ome tokens of my gratitude for the trouble I have given you."&mdash;"Far from thinking it any trouble at all, at all, I &s;hall be always <HI>ready,</HI> tho' I &s;ay it, who &s;hould not &s;ay it, to wait upon your &s;weet lady&s;hip, whenever you &s;hall do little Roger O' Tickle the honor to &s;ummon him." "I take you at your word, but you mu&s;t accept &s;ome token."&mdash;"Not I, upon my con&s;cience."&mdash;"Some little keep-&s;ake only then; here, &s;tep to the toilet, and make your election of the things on it." He obeyed; and, as my lucky &s;tars would have it, pitched upon a little Green Box, which &s;eemed to court his acceptance, and which Lord Churllow had that morning, in his hurry, left there. The lady, ignorant of its precious contents, (for &s;he conceived his Lord&s;hip had left it as a pre&s;ent) con&s;ented to his taking it away with him. I happened luckily to be at my door ju&s;t as O' Tickle returned with the box under his arm. I had &s;everal times at my friend Lord Toper's &s;een a mini&s;terial green box, and knew this to be one. I que&s;|tioned
<PB N="13" REF="11">the fellow about it; and as, like the re&s;t of his countrymen, he has too much &s;pirit to tell a lie, I collected to a tittle what I have ju&s;t communicated. Su&s;pecting that it might po&s;&s;ibly contain &s;omething worthy the &s;earch, I begg'd this <HI>trea&s;ure of &s;ecre&s;y</HI> of him, and was gratified. I had not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it half a dozen &s;econds before I ha&s;tened to my library, full of the di&s;coveries I knew I was about to make. I own at fir&s;t &s;ome &s;cruples of con|&s;cience about opening the box pre&s;&s;ed im|pertinently upon my mind; but the recollec|tion that Count ****** (a man of acknow|ledged nice honor) had fully debated, and &s;ettled the matter before me, determined me to open it, and <HI>pre&s;to cockilorum</HI> up flew the lid <HI>&s;ans</HI> further ceremony or delay.</P>
<P>The <HI>general</HI> applau&s;e the count gained from his countrymen by his conduct on that occa&s;ion, bids me hope for the approbation of an Engli&s;h public.&mdash;O you, my coun|trymen and fellow-&s;ufferers, who&s;e perdi|tion I cannot help anticipating, and who&s;e eyes I wi&s;h to open, &s;hall it be &s;aid of you, who&s;e annals record your &s;pirited and &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful oppo&s;ition to powerful u&s;urpation, that you wage unju&s;t and &s;avage war with your fellow &s;ubjects, with freemen, gloriou&s;ly &s;truggling for their rights and immunities? Shall &s;ons of the men who dethroned mighty potentates &s;ubmit to be the &s;laves of
<PB N="14" REF="12">things<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I tru&s;t it will not be imputed to me, that I mean <HI>the three things</HI> a patriotic earl (who&s;e zealous exertion of his fine talents in the cau&s;e of civil liberty cannot be too much applauded) <HI>&s;tooped</HI> to make mention of in the great debate on the Spani&s;h manife&s;to, viz. the gewgaw turtle-eating drow&s;y thing;&mdash;the catch and glee fre&s;h-water thing;&mdash;and the thing without candor, without veracity, without faith, which no man could tru&s;t, or &s;afely ven|ture upon the &s;malle&s;t intercour&s;e with.&mdash;No, God help them, they are poor, in&s;ignificant, harmle&s;s things; &mdash;mere puppets, without &s;ouls, wills, hearts, or tongues of their own.

I &s;aw too plainly how poor a chance I &s;tood of acting upon the auditory, when &s;uch eloquence could per&s;uade a third part only of the mem|bers pre&s;ent to be hone&s;t and faithful to their tru&s;t.</NOTE>?</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13">
<P>The EDITOR, in clo&s;e imitation of the Count, has publi&s;hed the pre&s;ent papers with|out any arrangement, but merely as he drew them out of the box; and he can, with Chri&s;tian &s;incerity, add, without era&s;ing a tit|tle, or without the &s;hadow of a hope of get|ting a pen&s;ion for his pains. He leaves it to the penetration of the Count's readers to de|termine whether <HI>he</HI> has been in like manner impartial and unexpectant.</P>
<P>The Editor held him&s;elf at full liberty to &s;ubjoin his own remarks, and to enlarge more or le&s;s on particular parts, not in proportion to their importance, but ju&s;t as fancy dic|tated; and this he did without caring to be at the trouble of correcting or revi&s;ing them. It may be &s;aid that this is not the mo&s;t de&s;pi|cable apology in the world for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing one's &s;entiments, but an in&s;ufficient vindica|tion of them after their appearance.&mdash;Granted. And therefore he &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if they have the good luck to gain the public approbation, no excu&s;e need be given for them; if they have not, he fears none will be admitted. Thus much however he af|firms, they are offered to the public in the humble language of truth and &s;incerity, as untainted by churli&s;h humours of malcon|tentedne&s;s, as uncorrupted by flattery. Tho' a &s;enator, he is not enli&s;ted under either of the banners of party, and knows the great
<PB N="16" REF="14">only by the fruits of their works. Too ju&s;t to think worth incompatible with rank, and too proud to court the acquaintance of the great, becau&s;e they are powerful, he has prai&s;ed or cen&s;ured but as he found them true or recreant to the &s;tate.</P>
<Q><L>Quid Romae faciam? mentiri ne&s;cio, magnum</L>

<P>He has not taken advantage of his con|cealment, and Fanfaron-like broached things which he &s;hall either blu&s;h or fear to main|tain. He has not even told as much truth as he has come at; and where left to fancy, con|trary to the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom of political dab|lers, he has &s;uppo&s;ed good. He had rather that ninety-and-nine guilty per&s;ons e&s;cape, than be the means of holding up one inno|cent to ridicule or obloquy.</P>

<HEAD>EDITOR's REMARK.</HEAD>
<P>However hard the&s;e terms may appear on the part of Mr. now a Lord Churllow, they certainly kick the beam the moment the other &s;cale receives its ponderous freight of twelve thou&s;and pounds a year, a fat Di&mdash;&s;s for a C&mdash;dp&mdash;le, and provi&s;ion infinite for p&mdash;ps and par&s;ons. The D&mdash;l him&s;elf needs not de&s;ire a &s;urer bait to catch all the lawyers in Chri&s;tendom.&mdash;For the conver&s;ion of tho&s;e (if any &s;uch there are) who &s;till are inclined to think that B. has outwitted C. in the contract, it will not be ami&s;s to add, that the latter is allowed on all hands to be as cunning an old fox as ever carried a bru&s;h. The former unque&s;tionably is no conjurer.</P>
<P>SECOND REMARK.</P>
<P>Honors, and the marks of re&s;pect commonly annexed to them, may flatter the vanity of men, but as they are not always the proof and reward of merit, in them&s;elves include no real glory or &s;olid greatne&s;s. When dealt out with a lavi&s;h and indi&s;criminate hand, they cea&s;e, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, to be honors. Our nobles are become &s;o numerous that it is almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to have nomen|clators, like tho&s;e that attended the candidates at Rome, to tell them the names of the citizens. But the **** who hath turned the &s;pirit of the nation again&s;t him&s;elf, mu&s;t u&s;e every means in his power to detach particular men from the body of the people, and to make them act by motives of private intere&s;t again&s;t the public &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>THIRD REMARK.</P>
<P>In creations, proce&s;s of lineage &s;hould always be con|&s;idered; how lightly &s;oever &s;ome may treat it, no man de&s;pi&s;es birth, but he who is con&s;cious of his deficiency in that point. Merit indeed may &s;upply the want of birth &s;o far as to de&s;erve e&s;teem, but it mu&s;t be united with birth to claim re&s;pect, as well as e&s;teem from all ranks.&mdash;The only genuine claims to merit are public &s;pirit, a &s;ound heart, clean hands, an attachment to the
<PB N="20" REF="17">reigning hou&s;e, the practice of religious duties, and a conduct invariably upright. Nothing more promotes a &s;pirit of emulation than the countenancing family repute. It was this that heightened the valor of the ancient Eng|li&s;h, and made family vie with family which &s;hould pro|duce the greate&s;t number of heroes. The hi&s;tories of many noble families &s;till extant among us will &s;ufficiently verify this a&s;&s;ertion; and there is no truth more obvious, than that if men will not act greatly for the enhancing of their family honor to which they have &s;o clo&s;e an af|finity, they &s;eldom will for the good of their country; for the more diffu&s;ed their connections become in gene|ral, the le&s;s intere&s;ted will they think them&s;elves, and con&s;equently the le&s;s tenacious will they be of the public welfare.&mdash;Thus when it &s;hould no longer be accounted of any con&s;ideration to be born of ance&s;tors who have eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by any worthy acts of public utility, but the man of ye&s;terday, by only po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing a more than common &s;hare of impudence and chicane, &s;hall be holden in equal reverence and repute, emulation will inevitably &s;ub&s;ide, and the de&s;ire of fame, which has been the &s;ource of &s;o many meritorious at|chievements, will &s;oon be extingui&s;hed; for every one will then live uninfluenced by the conduct of his proge|nitors, and equally unawed by any odium an infamous conduct may leave upon record.</P>
<P>FOURTH REMARK.</P>
<P>For the credit of human nature it is to be hoped there exi&s;ts not &s;uch a fool as that Prince mu&s;t be, who abets the divi&s;ions of his people, in&s;tead of &s;triving to unite them, and to be him&s;elf the center of their union; and who puts him&s;elf at the head of a party in order to go|vern his people, in&s;tead of heading his people in order to extirpate all party. Nothing is more certain or more demon&s;trable than that <HI>princes are made</HI> for the people, and not the people for them; and perhaps there is no nation under the &s;un more entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this notion of princes than the Engli&s;h; &s;o that the prince who does not govern him&s;elf by this maxim mu&s;t expect to find in the people &s;trenuous opponents of his will and pur&s;uits.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="18">
<P>FIFTH REMARK.</P>
<P>Our annals &s;how that the inhabitants of this ancient kingdom have ever borne an implacable hatred to that preliminary tyrant&mdash;a favourite; for which rea&s;on the wi&s;e&s;t of our monarchs never be&s;towed the royal confidence on one man, but di&s;tributed that and all other favours equally among the great officers of &s;tate; and the reigns of the&s;e monarchs are the happie&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t on record. So great indeed is the people's aver&s;ion to this creature of power, that it has often produced the noble&s;t effects, though per&s;onally fatal to the deluded prince or his fa|vourite: whil&s;t this aver&s;ion continues the con&s;titution is &s;afe; and no longer than the con&s;titution is main|tained in its original purity, is maje&s;ty &s;ecure. The hi&s;tory of all governments, however de&s;potic, verifies this remark.&mdash;I am ready to &s;upport this and every other I make on the pre&s;ent papers again&s;t any attack that comes with common &s;en&s;e and common decency in it.</P>

You will do well to peru&s;e them with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;|patch and attention.&mdash;We hold it but equi|table to apprize your Lord&s;hip, that on your &s;trict ob&s;ervance of them depends the en|joyment of your pre&s;ent honorable, and what is of infinitely more import, very lu|crative places.&mdash;The additions we are now about to make to what tho&s;e &s;heets will un|fold, &s;hall be equally plain, and comprized in as few words as their importance will allow.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is our joint will and plea&s;ure, that you prefer all Scots Tories and Jacobites who may do you the honor to &s;olicit &s;teeples and places in your gift; and this without pre&s;uming to que&s;tion their qua|lifications,
<PB N="23" REF="20">or weighing their de&s;erts. And in ca&s;es where none of the above de&s;crip|tion apply, you are to pay due re&s;pect to the recommendations of members, care|fully di&s;tingui&s;hing between the leaders and the &s;ubordinates; between tho&s;e who bring in and tho&s;e brought in; between the declaimers and the gapers or &s;ilent voters; tho&s;e who want places and tho&s;e we want in place. You &s;hall encourage and promote, to the utmo&s;t of your abi|lities, &s;loth, effeminacy, gaming, di&s;&s;ipa|tion, and luxury, with its attendant ele|gancies, as the &s;ure&s;t means of impoveri&s;h|ing and humbling the people, that they may be en&s;laved with more ea&s;e, and &endq;plundered with le&s;s ri&s;que.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;You &s;hall make frequent, though &s;light attacks upon the F*****m of the C**********n, till the pre&s;ent &s;piritle&s;s murmurs are changed into loud menaces, and the&s;e ripen into in&s;urrections. In one &s;hort, comprehen&s;ive word, You &s;hall &endq;make our cau&s;e your own.</Q></P>
<P>We deem it fit to apprize your Lord&s;hip that all our future commands will be delivered to you by one or other of our two plenipoes. Should any find their way to you through any other channel, or mode of conveyance, you are to con&s;ider them as &s;purious: our enemies are &s;ubtle, and adepts in the arts of
<PB N="24" REF="21">low deception, and it behoves us to be clo&s;e and vigilant; whil&s;t we are &s;o, we have no|thing to dread; nothing to fling away a thought upon: &s;ecure in our numbers, &s;e|curer in the&mdash;'s vindictive and inflexible &s;pi|rit; and &s;till &s;ecure&s;t in our all-promi&s;ing, powerful, and &s;ecret ally, we have every thing to hope.</P>

<P N="1">1&s;t. Whenever his ******* deigns to talk to me about the inferiority of our fleet&mdash;the defection of our old commanders&mdash;the de&s;er|tion of other nations&mdash;inva&s;ions and &s;uch like, I mu&s;t expatiate on the inundation of our &s;ailors&mdash;the great increa&s;e of our young officers&mdash;our alliance with the powerful Edi|tor of the Morning Po&s;t; with the Charcas, Cherokees, and Chicke&s;aws; and that which we (<HI>mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>placemen</HI>) have made with one another, an alliance &s;uperior to all other alliances, and which cannot fail to humble the pride, and puni&s;h the perfidy of our combined enemies.&mdash;On our inmo&s;t re|&s;ources, our light infantry of tenants and ploughmen, and cavalry of grooms and va|lets, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

If in a fit of the &s;ullens he &s;hould complain of our &s;upinene&s;s in America, I mu&s;t &s;trait produce the <HI>wonderful</HI> return of nails, &s;tuffed bags, barrels of pork, puncheons of rum, mola&s;&s;es, bags of &s;alt, keels, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. taken with &s;uch ri&s;k by Sir George Collier, in his predatory trip up Elizabeth River; and cheer him, by proving, beyond the reach of refutation, that the whole commerce of Che&s;apeek is at an end, and con&s;equently the &s;inews of rebellion de|&s;troyed.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="26">

<P N="4">4th. I begin to think we &s;hould tempt his ******* with beauty, and give to dalliance &s;ome of the hours he devotes to bu&s;ine&s;s and impertinent enquiry. It is evident he is be|coming &s;en&s;ible of our incapability, and it is hight time we furni&s;hed him with a mi&s;tre&s;s in our intere&s;ts. The Q**** is too wi&s;e to exchange peace for politics, and mu&s;ic's charms for war's alarms.

<P>Should we fail in our &s;cheme of &s;eduction, (and I own I am not very &s;anguine in my expectances) it will then become nece&s;&s;ary to &s;train every nerve, exert every &s;inew, and rack invention it&s;elf to keep him in good

<HEAD>EARL OF TEMPLE'S SPEECH.</HEAD>
<P>The Earl began with &s;aying, that he had a full detail of official blunders in his head, and a deep &s;en&s;e of the public calamities in his heart, and they both had co-operated to bring him to the Hou&s;e in de&s;pite of age and infirmities, and to make him give the pre&s;ent motion his warme&s;t &s;upport. He went over both grounds with his u&s;ual cool|ne&s;s and firmne&s;s, enumerating various in|&s;tances of the &s;upinene&s;s and ignorance of Ad|mini&s;tration.&mdash;In&s;tances which he grieved to ob&s;erve made a real change of coun&s;ellors and councils indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite to the nation's &s;ecurity. It was impo&s;&s;ible their Lord&s;hips could be &s;o blind to their intere&s;ts, as not to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of a change; and &s;omething whi&s;pered him within, that they would join with one heart and voice to bring about &s;o happy an event. He al|ready anticipated a new arrangement, and he prayed heaven it might prove as wi&s;e, ho|ne&s;t, and &s;ucce&s;sful an one, as that which in the la&s;t war rai&s;ed the Briti&s;h arms to a pitch of glory unparalleled in ancient or modern hi&s;tory, and of which he was the la&s;t &s;ur|viving member.&mdash; <Q>Not (cried his Lord|&s;hip) &startq;that I am very &s;anguine in my expec|tations
<PB N="36" REF="33">&mdash; &s;o very critical is the &s;tate of af|fairs&mdash;that any new men, however wi&s;e, will be able to &s;ave the nation. The &s;pleen of a pampered people has given place to a &s;ullen and inactive de&s;pondency, and it will take more time to quicken and put them into action again, than I fear our enemies will be di&s;po&s;ed to give them.&mdash;The connections we had mo&s;t rea&s;on to dread, we have ju&s;t been told are already formed. France has two formidable fleets out, and Spain, we have every rea&s;on to believe, keeps pace with her in her armaments.&mdash;The Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, forgetful of old benefits, no longet diverts the force of our natural enemies. Pru&s;&s;ia has not yet forgotten our breach of faith, and is too wi&s;e to tru&s;t us a &s;e|cond time. Even the feeble &s;upport of Denmark is not to be depended upon; and the alliance of marriages, which in the South had acquired unu&s;ual force for our de&s;truction, has in the North produced nothing in our favour.&mdash;Portugal, fen&s;ible of our inability to puni&s;h her, mocks and in&s;ults the very power to which &s;he owes her late deliverance from the inva&s;ion of her neighbouring enemies.&mdash;Ru&s;&s;ia has been inclined to a&s;&s;i&s;t us; but apprized of our impending ruin, is now prudently loth to involve her&s;elf for a people, who mu&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="34">&s;oon leave her to fight alone their de&s;pe|rate battles.&mdash;The American trade no longer furni&s;hes the &s;inews of naval great|ne&s;s, and our late colonies find employ|ment for the fleet which they u&s;ed to &s;up|ply with &s;ailors. This, my Lords, is the true picture of our pre&s;ent condition&mdash;a condition too de&s;perate I fear to be reme|died by the wi&s;e&s;t men. And yet there is a &s;tate in all bad things &s;o tran&s;cendently ill, that our rulers have left us &s;till &s;ome|thing to deprecate; and I have yet one reque&s;t to make to them, which is, that they will not involve us in a war with Holland, in a war where we &s;hall evident|ly be the aggre&s;&s;ors. It is true the United Provinces are a pacific nation, which has been clo&s;ely and firmly connected with us for a century; a nation which naturally wi&s;hes for a counterpoi&s;e to the power of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon; a nation which has too many millions in our funds to be likely to ri&s;e up again&s;t us without pro|vocation&mdash;but men can &s;ometimes forget their intere&s;ts in their pa&s;&s;ions. The pa&s;&s;ions of the Dutch are much inflamed, and the immediate object of narrow|minded merchants may be to &s;uppre&s;s a rival in commerce: be&s;ides, it is not the intere&s;t of any people to be in&s;ulted when they can help them&s;elves; and plain men
<PB N="38" REF="35">may look no further than this maxim. Our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in both the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies are tempting. To think they will not a&s;&s;ert the freedom of their country is weakne&s;s; to compel them to it is ab&s;o|lute di&s;grace: in our negociations with our &s;ew remaining friends let us avoid all crooked and overbearing policy, and act with &s;incerity, with frankne&s;s, with mo|deration, &endq;and with honor.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq; As this is the fir&s;t time I have troubled the Hou&s;e &s;ince the publication of a poli|tical negociation, which was maliciou&s;ly &s;aid to have taken place between my great (and unhappily for this country de|cea&s;ed) relation, and the concealed au|thor of all our evils, I tru&s;t your Lord|&s;hips will permit me to &s;ay a &s;hort word or two about that curious &s;tory.&mdash;My Lords, I took early alarm; my friend's honor, which has ever been as dear to me as my own, determined me, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, to probe the matter to the very bottom. My fir&s;t enquiry con|vinced me, that the whole was neither more nor le&s;s than the &s;illy plot of an of|ficious emi&s;&s;ary and an idle phy&s;ician, to bring their patrons to draw together, no doubt, in full confidence that if they &s;uc|ceeded, they &s;hould both be made privy coun&s;ellors at lea&s;t; &s;ure never was &s;o pe&s;ti|ferous
<PB N="39" REF="36">a de&s;ign &s;o poorly executed. Others, my Lords, envious of the &s;potle&s;s cha|racter the great Earl left behind him, and impotently &s;eeking to &s;ully it, have &s;ince thought fit to advance, that my friend was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the other's wi&s;dom and numbers, as to court an union with him. My Lords, this is an a&s;&s;ertion too pre|po&s;terous for refutation, and teems with ab&s;urdity enough in all con&s;cience to &s;tag|ger the credulity of even Scots, Jacobites, and Tories. That great &s;tate&s;man knew better than to confide in Scotch wi&s;dom, and ever guarded him&s;elf again&s;t danger when a Tory flattered. He was much too wi&s;e to be &s;urprized by courtly infinu|ations; he &s;aw the &s;nare, and, far from wi&s;hing to join the Thane, &s;purned the &s;ubtle advances with the contempt and indignation they de&s;erved. Go, cried he, to the di&s;appointed &s;on of Ae&s;culapius; go tell the officious emi&s;&s;ary, that the man he hopes to &s;urprize, loves the King, and people he has once &s;aved, too ardently to join one who has brought them to ruin. Tho&s;e, my Lords, were his words; and I tru&s;t every Engli&s;hman will wear them at his brea&s;t, till every Scot has lo&s;t his influence in the cabinet.&mdash;He knew the &s;ubtle &s;erpent too well, he had rea&s;on to know him too well, to take him into

<P>His Lord&s;hip, far from blu&s;hing at it, &s;aid, <Q>He gloried in not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, like &startq;&s;ome others, that weight of eloquence and volubility of &s;peech which carry every thing with them. For his part he could not &s;ee of what other u&s;e they were to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, than to render them un|happy in them&s;elves, and trouble&s;ome to their neighbours. That he had with his mother's milk imbibed the utmo&s;t horror for rhetoric, logic, and all &s;uch pedantic &s;tuff, to which he could never be brought to apply either by private admonition or public reprehen&s;ion. He therefore humbly begged he might, without excit|ing the merriment of the Hou&s;e, be per|mitted to <HI>read</HI> his &s;entiments which he had brought in his pocket; and hoped their Lord&s;hips would not conclude from his adopting that mode of delivering them, that he was indebted to his chaplain for them: they were genuine, and his own to a &s;yllable.

<P>His Lord&s;hip followed the Earl of G&mdash;y.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;He &s;aid, he was not <HI>much given to &s;pend</HI> his breath any where, and had ever been particularly <HI>thrifty</HI> of it in that Hou&s;e; but in a matter wherein he was &s;o e&s;&s;entially intere&s;ted, it would be imprudent, it would be more, it would be criminal to ob&s;erve his wonted &s;ilence. He was as zealous in oppo&s;ing the addre&s;s, as the noble Earl who had ju&s;t been upon his legs could be, though on grounds as diametrically oppo&s;ite as the hues of their ribbons. Far from being an advocate for the pro&s;ecution of the war, he reprobated it with all his heart, with all his mind, with all his &s;oul, and with all his &s;trength; not in the lan|guage of a noble Duke, as barbarous, fe|rocious, and nefarious, but merely as an <HI>expen&s;ive one,</HI> in&s;piring the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s|ful forebodings, and pregnant with uni|ver&s;al bankruptcy. God knew he had al|ready felt its effects mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly; and on the &s;acred word of a Peer he could a&s;&s;ure their Lord&s;hips, that the weekly expences of his table alone had, within the la&s;t three years, increa&s;ed ju&s;t 20 &frac18; per cent. and if his cook (who had that morning told him that he could get only three eggs
<PB N="46" REF="43">a groat) &s;poke truth, he was confident they would not fall &s;hort of 22 &frac14; by Mi|chaelmas.

An enormous &s;um, indeed; which carried ruin in its eye, and wore fa|mine in its countenance; and which he defied the mo&s;t prodigal Peer to view with|out horror. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, he mu&s;t be a madman not to oppo&s;e an ad|dre&s;s which &s;truck at his very exi&s;tence; yes, his exi&s;tence; for, if with the emolu|ments of his place, he did but barely exi&s;t, he &s;hould be glad to know what he was &endq;to do when they were <HI>ravi&s;hed</HI> from him?</Q></P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip went largely into the many con&s;equential evils of war, and dwelt with particular energy on taxes, which, like Aaron's rod, &s;wallowed up all the re&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;He had ever paid them as cheerfully as his neighbours, nor did he even murmur when they became &s;o heavy that his two di&s;hes and a bottle of claret were reduced to one and a pint of port; but now they were more than fle&s;h and blood could bear. For his part, he wondered when the great financier would hold his hand; he &s;uppo&s;ed &mdash; God forgive him, if he made an <HI>uncharitable</HI> judgment, but he could not help &s;uppo&s;ing&mdash;not till he had with

<P>For the benefit of tho&s;e of my Readers who live out of the world, and may wi&s;h to be better acquainted with the group of gaping Tritons, whom Lord Churllow in his Notes has made &s;uch honourable mention of, it will not be ami&s;s or un&s;ea&s;onable to <HI>expo&s;e</HI> to public view their &s;ix &s;hades taken warm from nature.</P>
<P>D. r. y.</P>
<P>Is a man of little reading or ob&s;ervation, of &s;till le&s;s profe&s;&s;ional experience, and no more fit for the chair of ju&s;tice he has lately filled, than he was to be Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's Bench. It is however &s;ome little apology for him, that he was drawn into it by a couple of lords, who&s;e &s;ubtlety and power he was too weak to di&s;cern, too timid to re&s;i&s;t: till lately he was mode&s;tly &s;en&s;ible of his incapability, and concealed him&s;elf
<PB N="64" REF="61" MS="Y">from notice and ridicule in prudent &s;olitude and becoming inactivity. He was deemed an excellent tool, and deluded into bu&s;ine&s;s. Poor man! now that he has advanced too far to recede, he finds him&s;elf plunged in a &s;ea of trouble.

<P>D. g. y.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip was the eleventh that went into action, and the fir&s;t out of it. He is one of the few who&s;e conduct mu&s;t have undergone a &s;crutiny, had Sir H. Splice been condemned. He di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf very much in the trial, by que&s;tions which tended to embarra&s;s the witne&s;&s;es, and lead them to bring out facts in their cro&s;s examination that might contradict their fir&s;t evidence. He has travelled through life with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s, but owes it le&s;s to his merit, than to a happy and pliant arrangement of &s;miles and &s;impers, joined with a &s;ober mien of gravity, which impo&s;es on the world an idea of wi&s;dom, whil&s;t the mo&s;t &s;tudied courte&s;y imparts the &s;emblance of friend&s;hip.

<P>The &s;ure&s;t way to get rid of an ingrate, is to confer an obligation upon him.</P>
<P>THIRD REMARK.</P>
<P>Of all the virtues which the antients po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed (&s;ays a &s;en&s;ible writer) the &s;incerity of their friend&s;hips appears to me as the highe&s;t di&s;tinction of their characters: their firm attachments has been the con&s;tant theme of pane|gyric, and if we examine their conduct as companions, we &s;hall find that the rites of their religion were not more &s;acred than the laws of &s;ociety. Neither the menaces of authority, nor the bribes of corruption, could compel or &s;educe them into a breach of confidence, No character was &s;o generally odious as that of a betrayer. He was ab|horred and &s;hunned wherever he went. His di&s;coveries were deemed the effects of malevolence, and received with contempt. Without inveighing again&s;t the practice of the pre&s;ent times, or comparing them with that of the pa&s;t, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if friend&s;hips are no longer to be formed upon principles of fidelity, there is rea&s;on to fear that we are placed in the mo&s;t unfortunate and la|mentable aera &s;ince the creation of mankind. It is not the increa&s;e of vices, in&s;eparable from humanity, that alarms us, but it is the ab&s;ence of that integrity, the neg|lect of that virtue, the contempt of that honor, which, by connecting individuals, formed &s;ociety, and without which &s;ociety can no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="76">
<P>FOURTH REMARK.</P>
<P>When Ari&s;totle was once a&s;ked, what a man could gain by uttering fal&s;hoods; he replied, <Q>not to be credited &startq;&endq;when he &s;hall &s;peak the truth.</Q> The character of a liar is at once &s;o hateful and contemptible, that it might be expected even of tho&s;e who have lo&s;t their virtue, that they &s;hould be re&s;trained by their pride from the vio|lation of truth. Almo&s;t every other vice that di&s;graces human nature may be kept in countenance by applau&s;e and a&s;&s;ociation; the liar, and only the liar, is invariably, and univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed, abandoned, and di&s;owned.</P>
<P>FIFTH REMARK.</P>
<P>It is e&s;&s;ential to the very exi&s;tence of a free government, that the &s;ubject &s;hould have full liberty to declare his principles and opinions; and every act which tends to coerce that liberty, is tyrannical, and injurious to the community. The pre&s;s is the medium through which opinions are di&s;&s;eminated among the people. It is the con&s;titutional Cen&s;or and controller of princes, the ac|cu&s;er of bad mini&s;ters, and the mo&s;t efficacious in&s;tru|ment for rou&s;ing and forming the people to re&s;i&s;t de&s;po|ti&s;m. The liberty of the pre&s;s is of &s;uch infinite con&s;e|quence in this country, that if the con&s;titution was overturned, and the people en&s;laved, a man of &s;pirit, with a free pre&s;s, might &s;oon re&s;tore the one, and re|deem the other: without it, the brave&s;t people can|not long pre&s;erve their rights and liberties.</P>
<P>SIXTH REMARK.</P>
<P>Per&s;onal &s;atire again&s;t corrupt Mini&s;ters, and tho&s;e tools of power who gorge them&s;elves with the entrails of their country, differs widely from that per&s;onal &s;atire which too often proceeds merely from &s;elf-love or ill|nature;
<PB N="80" REF="77">the one is written in defence of the public, the other in defence of &s;elf: the one is armed by the &s;word of Ju&s;tice, and eneouraged not only by the voice of the people, but by the principles of morality; the other is dictated by pa&s;&s;ion, &s;upported by pride, and ap|plauded by flattery.</P>

<P N="10">10. Pandemonium, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Exhibits a very de&s;picable and diabolical picture of the human &s;pecies; for which the painter de&s;erves a cart's tail, and a total deprivation of every comfort and indul|gence which can be admini&s;tered by that humanity, of which he has drawn &s;o unfavourable a repre&s;entation.</P>
<P N="11">11. An Apology, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>If we are not mi&s;informed, little I&s;aac has been much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his friends in providing the pre&s;ent entertain|ment.
<PB N="92" REF="89">It certainly is an exception to the old adage of "The more cooks the wor&s;e broth." Profe&s;&s;ed wits are u&s;ually &s;evere and &s;atirical; but mirth is the &s;ource of I&s;aac's wit. He &s;eems rather to invite you to partake of his merriment, than to attend to his je&s;ts. Had his &s;trokes been general, the per&s;on mu&s;t have been both a churl and a dolt, who did not join in the mirth. The per&s;onal at|tack upon <HI>his two friends</HI> di&s;covers &s;omething wrong with|in, and admits of no palliation.</P>
<P N="12">12. Amours, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>A tickler. Probably fir&s;t undertaken to relieve a tem|porary exigence; the profits of its execution being pre|viou&s;ly di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P N="13">13. An E&s;&s;ay on Man, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Extravagantly &s;illy and puerile throughout. Of the hero of the piece I &s;hall ju&s;t &s;ay, what was ob&s;erved of Zenobia's hermaphrodite a&s;s, that the creature would not be without its u&s;e, if it had but a &s;ex.</P>
<P N="14">14. The Hero's Reveries, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>If publications are to be e&s;timated by the variety and richne&s;s of the entertainment they afford, our pre&s;ent au|thor has a better title to the thanks of the public, than all who have gone before him in the &s;ame walk: but let a work have ever &s;o much merit in it&s;elf it may lie long neglected, if &s;ome circum&s;tance does not immediately gain it the public attention: the author of the&s;e reveries was aware of this, and has very wi&s;ely in&s;ured a favourable fir&s;t reception, by dedicating them to General Minden; an excellent judge of all literary merit, but of this parti|cular branch indi&s;putably the be&s;t judge in the kingdom. I cannot, in ju&s;tice to the good ta&s;te of my readers, but &s;uppo&s;e that mo&s;t of them are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this li|terary trea&s;ure, &s;o that what I have &s;aid of it, is to be con&s;idered as done rather with a view of paying the tribute of prai&s;e, where prai&s;e is &s;o ju&s;tly due, than to recom|mend a work, who&s;e merit alone mu&s;t have univer&s;ally
<PB N="93" REF="90">recommended it before the&s;e &s;heets can have reached the public.</P>
<P N="15">15. The Temple of Virtue.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tently with the brevity of my de|&s;ign, to give the reader a proper idea of this very excel|lent work. An ab&s;tract would convey no ju&s;ter idea of it than the &s;keleton of a departed beauty would of her form when &s;he was alive. Indeed the great and ju&s;t applau&s;e with which it has been received by all ranks of people makes it totally unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing at all about it. Its merit is unque&s;tionably of the very fir&s;t cla&s;s; and I am particularly happy in adding my &s;uffrage to the public voice.</P>

<P>The following paper (the la&s;t but one I took out of the box) was written by the late Earl of Chatham. Not that I found his Lord&s;hip's &s;ignature to it; but I have often &s;een his hand-writing, and knew it to be his the moment I ca&s;t my eye upon the paper: it does not appear how it came to be in <HI>&s;uch good company;</HI> nor can I, for particular rea&s;ons of a private nature, bring my|&s;elf to think that it was ever &s;ent by the great Earl to its late po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or Lord Churllow. If I may ri&s;k a conjecture, it was written by that great man to one of his friends, and &s;ince his death given by that friend to Lord Churllow as a copy for imitation. How clo&s;ely the <HI>noble</HI> Lord has followed it, I leave to others to determine.</P>

<PB N="98" REF="95">entered the &s;acred clo&s;et, but I thought my|&s;elf accountable to God and my country for every &s;yllable I uttered in it.

Such a kind of magi&s;trate is odious to our con&s;ti|tution. I was fond of coun&s;el, and &s;ought it often, but of tho&s;e only whom I knew to be friends from principle to the reigning Prince.

<P>"It is a certain fact that Lord Churllow was pre&s;&s;ed la&s;t night in St. Giles, as he was returning home from e&mdash;l, button'd up, as u&s;ual, in his old ru&s;ty brown coat, &s;louched hat, wor&s;ted &s;tockings, and pi&s;s-burnt caxen. You who know the figure and appearance of the man, will not doubt the truth of the fact. He is the fir&s;t man a pre&s;s-gang would pitch upon for a &s;ailor, and the la&s;t they could &s;u&s;pect of being a gentleman. They took him. He blu&s;tered and &s;wore in his u&s;ual rough manner; but the very means he took to per&s;uade them that he was a gentle|man, &s;erved to convince them that he was &s;ome impudent bullying fellow who wi&s;hed to make his e&s;cape by that means.&mdash; <Q>You &startq;a gentleman&mdash;you black looking &s;on of a b&mdash;, exclaimed the Tar. D&mdash; my eyes, I &s;hould rather &s;u&s;pect you for a &s;wabber. No, no, bear a hand&mdash;You have a d&mdash;d fine hulk and good timbers of your own, and we will make you a gentlemen, I &endq;warrant you.</Q>&mdash;He then changed his tone and expo&s;tulated in mild terms, but all would not do, and away they hurried his Lord&s;hip to the hou&s;e of rendezvous on Tower Hill; nor was he di&s;charged till &s;ix next morning. He di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to his friend Twitcher the moment he reached Tower Hill; but Jemmy enjoyed the joke too much to procure his relea&s;ement in a hurry; and
<PB N="102" REF="99">(I am told) ab&s;olutely &s;ent letters to the lieu|tenant, ordering him not to di&s;charge him on any &s;core whatever till he came him&s;elf there. At &s;ix, when Twitcher went to the hou&s;e, he found his Lord&s;hip with three Tars dead drunk under the table; and it was not without &s;ome difficulty that he prevailed upon him at la&s;t to get into his carriage, &s;o plea&s;ed was his Lord&s;hip with the jollity of the Tars, and the goodne&s;s of the porter he had been &s;wallowing by the gallon.</P>
