<HEAD>A VIEW OF THE Several Intere&s;ts of <HI>Europe,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Death of the Emperor of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> had it happen'd at any other time than this, had, perhaps, been an Event of as little Con&s;equence to <HI>Europe,</HI> as any thing of that Nature could have been; and yet at this time, it comes attended with &s;o many unu&s;ual Circum&s;tances, that the Death of no Prince in Chri&s;tendom could have the like.</P>
<P>The Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> is in it &s;elf a va&s;t unwieldy Body, under perhaps as good an Oe|conomy as a Body made up of &s;o many Members can be, but at the &s;ame time that Oeconomy has not in the be&s;t manner been made Practicabl$: witne&s;s in particular, the fruitle&s;s endeavours of the Dyet of the Empire, to oblige the Re|&s;pective Members to furni&s;h their Quota of Troops to the Army, or of Money to the Mili|tary Che&s;t of the Empire; of the Deficiency of which, we have had &s;ad Experience in this pre|&s;ent War; when, had the Empire exerted it &s;elf in
<PB N="2" REF="3">
due proportion, one part to the other, and ac|cording to the decrees of the Dyet; the <HI>French</HI> Power had, long before now, &s;unk under the Superior Forces of the Confederates.</P>
<P>As the Empire has been thus, by its own Weight and Bulk, render'd unactive, &s;o have the Emperors them&s;elves, <HI>of late years e&s;pecially;</HI> whether by the Embarra&s;sment of their Affairs, the various and too great pre&s;&s;ures of the War on every &s;ide, which they have now for near Thirty Years been oppre&s;&s;ed with, or from meer Confu&s;ion of Councils, we will not deter|mine; but that they have been &s;o, is apparent. It is true, the Emperor <HI>Leopold,</HI> Father of the late <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and al&s;o the late Emperor, had in &s;undry ca&s;es wonderful Succe&s;&s;es; &s;uch as a Series of Victory again&s;t the <HI>Turks;</HI> and after, again&s;t the Elector of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> pu&s;hing the <HI>French</HI> out of <HI>Italy;</HI> the Conque&s;t of <HI>Naples;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>But how did every War fir&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s them? from which Di&s;tre&s;s they behooved to be always Re&s;cued and Delivered, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of o|thers; as $rom t$$ $word$ by the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and Elector of <HI>Saxony;</HI> from the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> by the Duke of <HI>Marl-borough;</HI> and the like. Twice we &s;ee the Emper|or frighted from <HI>Vienna;</HI> once by the <HI>Turk,</HI> and once by the <HI>Bavarian:</HI> The <HI>Hungarians</HI> often In&s;ulted him at the very Gates of his Capital City; and the <HI>Swede</HI> frightned him into a Re|&s;titution of the Prote&s;tant Churches of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and &s;ending Count <HI>Zober, as we may &s;ay,</HI> with a Halter about his Neck to &s;ubmit to the Mercy of the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
Had it been at any other time than this, if Five or Six Emperors had Dyed, it had made no alteration in the Publick Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> at all; an In&s;tance of which we have in the Death of the Emperor <HI>Leopold,</HI> when there was no|thing at all to do, but for his Son to &s;tep into the Imperial Throne; who was before, in a manner, Coadjutor, or Declar'd apparent Suc|ce&s;&s;or, by being Cho&s;en King of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>But now the Ca&s;e is quite altred, and the Death of the Emperor &s;eems to give a &s;hock to all <HI>Europe.</HI> The Princes &s;tand at Gaze and Look|ing upon one another, as if &s;aying to one ano|ther, <HI>What will become of us now?</HI> All the con|certed Mea&s;ures, whether of War or Confede|racy, are at a full &s;top; the Engagements between Princes, Nations, and States, are broken and di&s;&s;olved by this Accident; and all the Mea|&s;ures, whether of War, Peace, or Confedera|cy, will &s;uffer &s;ome Change about it.</P>
<P>In order to come at a view of the &s;everal In|tere&s;ts of <HI>Europe,</HI> in this important Conjuncture, it may not be Unprofitable for us, to enquire how far the &s;everal Princes and States of the World are concern'd and affected in this &s;ud|den &s;troak, and what may probably be the re|&s;ult of their &s;aid Concern in the Proce&s;s of this Summers Conduct. In the view of which, their &s;everal true Intere&s;ts will appear, and &s;o need but a very &s;hort &s;umming up into Generals at the end.</P>
<P>To do this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to lay down the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the Family of the De|ceas'd, as Head of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and as Emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
As to his Family, we are to &s;uppo&s;e him Dead without Children, that it without Sons, and his Titles, Honours, Kingdoms and E&s;tates, de&s;cend directly to his Brother <HI>Charles,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> now proclaim'd King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Fighting for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in <HI>Catalognia.</HI> By the Death of the Emperor, and as Head of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> this Prince (the Daugh|ters not Inheriting) becomes King of <HI>Hun|garia, Bohemia, Croatia, Dalmatia,</HI> and <HI>Sclavonia,</HI> Prince of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> Duke of <HI>Stiria, Carinthia, Sile&s;ia, Carniola,</HI> Mar|quis of <HI>Moravia,</HI> Count <HI>de Tyrol;</HI> the&s;e are tho&s;e we call the Hereditary Countries, not mention|ing le&s;&s;er Principalities, noted in the Maps of <HI>Germany</HI> thus, <HI>Au Mai&s;on de Au&s;triche,</HI> e&s;pecially in the Circle of <HI>Swabia.</HI></P>
<P>By the Death of this Prince as Emperor, <HI>Charles</HI> comes into no acce&s;&s;ion, but that of the Kingdom or Electorate of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> by which he has a Voice in the College of Electors; but by this he &s;tands fair to be cho&s;en Emperor.</P>
<P>As then to the Empire, this Prince leaves the Imperial Throne in various Embarra&s;sments, Wars, Alliances and Engagements, which one way or other re&s;pect indeed the whole Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P N="1">1. The whole Empire falls under this Gene|ral Embarra&s;sment, That there being no King of the <HI>Romans</HI> Elected, there is no immediate Succe&s;&s;or to enter upon the Imperial Admini|&s;tration; nor can there be any Management of the Imperial Affairs, but as by the Golden Bull, or Con&s;titution of the Empire Directed by the Arbi&s;hop of <HI>Mentz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
This immediately produces this unhappy Con&s;equence, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That it Embroils all <HI>Germany</HI> in Factions and Parties in order to a new Election. A thing &s;o unexpected, &s;o un|fore&s;een, &s;o unthought of, that it is hard to Gue&s;s who &s;hall be a Candidate for &s;uch an ex|traordinary Advancement: None of the Electors them&s;elves &s;eem Capable.</P>
<P>To explain this, and that we may be under|&s;tood as we go along, we mean by Capable, ei|ther they are in Circum&s;tances which render them unfit for the Empire, or the Empire unfit for them; either their Circum&s;tances are &s;uch as that the Electors can by no means think of Choo&s;ing them, or in Circum&s;tances, that if they did Choo&s;e them, they would by no means accept of it. <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>PRUSSIA, or BRANDENBURGH, is a Prote&s;tant, and newly Erected into a King, and it is not a very wide Conjecture to &s;ay he would not accept it, having a Powerful and Commanding Intere&s;t in that part of <HI>Europe,</HI> yet &s;uch an Interfering Intere&s;t on many ac|counts with the Imperial Affairs, that as it would not be his Intere&s;t to accept the Imperial Dignity, &s;o neither could it be the Intere&s;t of any of the other Electors to Choo&s;e him, and this on many Accounts too great, and too many to enter upon here.</P>
<P>SAXONY has accepted another Crown, and could not be cho&s;en Emperor without ef|fectually either Relinqui&s;hing the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI> a &s;econd time, or Embroiling the whole Empire in a Bloody and Fatal War with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> a thing at &s;uch a time as this not to be thought on, without hazarding the very Impe|rial
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Crown it &s;elf, while &s;o many other Wars at once oppre&s;s or threaten it.</P>
<P>BAVARIA is an Exile, and has none to recommend him, is under the Ban, Declar'd a Rebbel to the Empire, his Electorate &s;eized up|on, and the upper <HI>Palatinate,</HI> part of it actually given to, and ve&s;ted in the Elector <HI>Palatine.</HI></P>
<P>HANNOVER has accepted the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Britain,</HI> which he would be Di&s;tracted if he &s;hould quit for two Empires.</P>
<P>The next are the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Electors, and they cannot be Emperors by the Con|&s;titution. The only Prince left is King <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the Elector Palatine, and the Con|&s;equences of the&s;e being cho&s;en, &s;hall be con|&s;idred by them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. As Emperor, the Throne, or Imperial Crown, is left in the&s;e Embarra&s;sments.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t.</HI> A Fierce and Bloody War with the Male|contents in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> Subject to the Emperor as King of <HI>Hungary;</HI> a War, which as their King was Emperor, the whole Imperial Power was embark'd in again&s;t them; but if their So|vereign &s;hould come to be only Head of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> it may be doubtful how well he would be able to deal with them, as they may be back'd with <HI>Swedi&s;h, Turki&s;h,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> A League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive with <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turks;</HI> which League, in ca&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould Invade <HI>Poland,</HI> as there is very little Rea&s;on to hope they will not, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily Involve the Empire in a terrible War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and this at a time, when the Empire it &s;elf is Embroil'd on every
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&s;ide: In <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> with the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Poles;</HI> in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> with the Exil'd Elector, who eagerly waits an opportunity to return, and his Subjects, as eagerly an opportunity to receive him: In <HI>Italy,</HI> with King <HI>Philip,</HI> who being po&s;&s;e&s;t of <HI>Sicily,</HI> lies at the Door of <HI>Na|ples,</HI> ready to enter when the <HI>Neopolitans,</HI> al|ready Malecontents enough at the <HI>German</HI> Go|vernment, &s;hall give them the lea&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> A Cruel and Expen&s;ive War again&s;t <HI>France</HI> in General, in Conjunction with the Confederates, <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> with the other Members of the Grand Alliance.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> The Affair of King <HI>Charles</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> which tho' it is true, that it is indeed a branch of the &s;ame War, yet has particularly lain hard upon the Emperor to &s;upport, as being &s;o much for the Particular Intere&s;ts of the Imperial Hou&s;e; and which way however it may now go, cannot be abandon'd, without giving up entire|ly the Confederates, and breaking in upon the Grand Alliance above-named.</P>
<P>It is not &s;o much the de&s;ign of this Tract, to draw a Scheme of the pre&s;ent Intere&s;ts of the Empire as it is to examine how the Intere&s;t of the re&s;pective Powers in <HI>Europe</HI> &s;tand as to a new Election, and this we concieve to be the great pre&s;ent concern, not of this Nation only, but of all the Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and what our Eyes at this time are generally upon.</P>
<P>There is no que&s;tion but <HI>Charles,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and now called King of <HI>Spain,</HI> is next Heir to all the Hereditary Dominions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the Emperor having left no Male-I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
There is no que&s;tion, But, had the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles</HI> not been declar'd King of <HI>Spain,</HI> he would at this time have been Unanimou&s;ly elected King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and declared Em|peror.</P>
<P>But the que&s;tion properly before us, <HI>is this,</HI> Whether &s;hall the King of <HI>Spain</HI> content him|&s;elf with the Hereditary Dominions of <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> taking his Hazard with the Confederates for the Recovery of the Monarchy of <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;o decline the Imperial Dignity? or de|clining his pur&s;uit of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, as attended with great Hazard, Expence, Diffi|culty and Uncertainty, Shall he immediately apply him&s;elf to Cultivate his Intere&s;t in the Colledge of Electors, in order to obtain the Imperial Dignity?</P>
<P>OR, Taking <HI>Spain</HI> to be his Hereditary Right, which now no doubt it is, <HI>tho' before it was not,</HI> &s;hall endeavour to be Cho&s;en Emperor, and keep his hold of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy at the &s;ame time? As to what the King of <HI>Spain</HI> will re&s;olve in this Ca&s;e, no Man can determine, we are very well aware, that Princes, like other Men, never think they have too much; never give up any thing they can lay hold on; or part with any thing they can keep: And no doubt but King <HI>Charles</HI> may be very willing to be Emperor and King of <HI>Spain</HI> too, of which we &s;hall come to &s;peak by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But as to the fir&s;t Choice, if we might &s;peak for King <HI>Charles,</HI> there &s;eems to be no Compa|ri&s;on in the Choice; but that if he can obtain to be Cho&s;en Emperor, and enjoy all the Heredi|tary Dominions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> it &s;eems much better to him, than the Uncertain
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Game of a War, which yet he knows not how it &s;hall end We need &s;pend no time in making the Compari&s;on between the Circum&s;tances of the two Dominions, they are both va&s;tly great, however we &s;hall in brief &s;um up the Account of both:</P>
<P>The Imperial Dignities Superiour, <HI>that is fir&s;t allow'd,</HI> however I &s;hall rate that at but very little, being of no Weight in the Wealth or Power of the Prince.</P>
<P>The Influence, Power, and Advantages, in, over, and from the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> are in|finitely more to the Empire than to <HI>Spain;</HI> nor is there any Compari&s;on between the figure a King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and an Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> makes in the World: The former is unable to &s;tand upon his own Legs again&s;t the meane&s;t of the Capital Powers of <HI>Europe;</HI> the latter's able to Defend it &s;elf again&s;t the mo&s;t Powerful, and has, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, by its own meer Strength, carried on the Greate&s;t Wars in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Native &s;trength of the Empire is, with|out Compari&s;on, more than Ten-fold &s;uperior to that of <HI>Spain,</HI> if we take it as it now &s;tands: The Emperor, at the time of his Death, main|tain'd out of his own Trea&s;ury above 200000 Men, be&s;ides the Troops of the Circles, which they call the Army of the Empire, the Charge of which is what they call the <HI>Roman Months,</HI> Levied by Quota upon the Princes of the Em|pire, and be&s;ides the Armies which the &s;everal Electors are able, and are oblig'd to bring into the Field, when the whole is in Danger. Were the Troubles of <HI>Hungaria</HI> appea&s;ed, and the
<PB N="10" REF="11">
whole Strength of that Kingdom united, the Emperor has been able to rai&s;e very great Forces in that Kingdom, and in <HI>Tran&s;ylvania;</HI> and in the late War again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Emperor had above 80000 <HI>Hungarians, Tran|&s;ylvanians</HI> and <HI>Croatians</HI> in his Army.</P>
<P>The weakne&s;s of <HI>Spain,</HI> e&s;pecially at this time, either in Money or in Troops, is &s;uch; that tho' the Dominions are va&s;tly large, and &s;peaking of the <HI>Spani&s;h Indies,</HI> they may be &s;aid to have more Money than all the World, yet they make no Figure, can rai&s;e no Men, can do nothing in the World Comparatively to make a Monarch Great, or them&s;elves Regarded.</P>
<P>We might mention the Difference of the Peo|ple as to the Soldierly part of things, the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> and <HI>Hungarians</HI> are Warlike, Bold, Da|ring, Enterpri&s;ing and Hardy, and make as good Soldiers as any in the World; the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> Proud, Slothful, Effeminate, Cowardly and unfit for War; in &s;hort, good for nothing: Nor can the King of <HI>Spain</HI> Rai&s;e an Army in any of his Dominions, that when they are Rais'd and Arm'd, may be depended upon.</P>
<P>It is indeed true, that, were a Politic Active Prince upon the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Throne, that were to regulate the Oeconomy of that va&s;t Monarchy, that could bring their Trade to a New Model, Encourage Manufactures and Indu&s;try, and &s;et the Inhabitants to Improve them&s;elves; that the Immen&s;e Trea&s;ure they po&s;&s;e&s;s might not nece&s;&s;ary flow from them to other Countries for the Manufactures and Labour of Nations re|mote to them; that could bring the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="12">
to Arts, Sciences, Indu&s;try and War, they would recover them&s;elves, and be the Greate&s;t Nation in the World: But this mu&s;t be the Work of Time, perhaps of Ages, and no Prince can expect to bring them to it in his Reign.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons it cannot be doubted, but that King <HI>Charles</HI> will, upon the fir&s;t News of the Death of the Emperor, make the be&s;t of his way to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Hereditary Dominions of his Brother, and to make his Intere&s;t Good, in order to be Elected Emperor.</P>
<P>We &s;hall next &s;uppo&s;e the Ca&s;e either way:</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Suppo&s;e he fails in the latter, and is not cho&s;en Emperor, but the Choice falls upon &s;ome other Prince.</P>
<P>If this happens, the fir&s;t thing to be &s;aid is, That New Emperor comes to the Imperial Dignity in a weak Divided Po&s;ture, uncapable to &s;upport the Figure in the pre&s;ent War which the la&s;t Emperors have made; becau&s;e the He|reditary Dominions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> &s;hall be then in another Hand, from which He|reditary Dominions, the main Strength both in Men and Money which the la&s;t Emperor car|ried on the War with are derived. Let us &s;ee how this re&s;pects the pre&s;ent Confederacy.</P>
<P>It is the Empire then only, and not the Em|peror, which will be the Member of the Confe|deracy, and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> remains no more a branch of the Alliance. It is true, we have complain'd that the Emperor did nothing, and the Emperor did not do his part, and the
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Empire Gain'd by the War, and the like: But when you come to Di&s;tingui&s;h between the Em|peror and the Empire, you will find then that indeed the Emperor, not the Empire, has done all. Have we not, <HI>we mean the Confederates now Eugag'd in the War again&s;t</HI> France, 18000 Impe|rial Troops in <HI>Flanders,</HI> 8000 upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> 12000 in <HI>Piemont,</HI> 12000 in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> 10000 in <HI>Millain, Mantua,</HI> and the other Fiefs in <HI>Italy,</HI> 8000 in <HI>Naples,</HI> and 16000, including the&s;e now &s;ending in <HI>Spain;</HI> all the&s;e are acting again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> or keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Countries, which, if they were not there, would &s;oon fall into the Power of the <HI>French:</HI> And of the&s;e Troops not one Regiment are maintain'd by the Empire, but by the Emperor in his Here|ditary Capacity. The Empire maintains in|deed the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Landau, Philipsburgh, Friburgh,</HI> and the Fore&s;t Towns, with the For|tifications upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Neckar.</HI> The Empire &s;ends the Circular Troops little Quo|ta's and Parties of Men which compo&s;e the Army upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and were we to tru&s;t to them, it would &s;oon appear what would be the fate of the Confederacy. From whence this Con&s;equence may be drawn,</P>
<P>That it is the manife&s;t Intere&s;t of the Confe|deracy, that the Imperial Crown &s;hould be continued in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>This will be&s;t be Demon&s;trated, by &s;uppo|&s;ing any other Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> Elected to the Imperial Throne.</P>
<P>The Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> is the Man we might pre|&s;ume to &s;tand faire&s;t for it, and this Prince has in|deed &s;ome Dominions of his own in the Empire, as the <HI>Electorate,</HI> the <HI>&V;pper Palatinate,</HI> with the
<PB N="13" REF="14">
Dutchy of <HI>Juliers</HI> and <HI>Berg;</HI> out of all which the utmo&s;t Strength he can Rai&s;e and Maintain, and that but for a while, might be about 28 or 30000 Men, to &s;peak with the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Will this be an equivalent to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria?</HI> will this carry on the War in <HI>P$emont, Italy,</HI> and the <HI>Rhine?</HI> will this be able to &s;up|port the $lliance, and the Degree of it, which the Emperor hath always been Rated at?</P>
<P>It is true, that if this were pu&s;hed, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> being then po&s;&s;e&s;t of the Dominions of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> might apply the whole &s;trength there|of to &s;upport his Pretentions to <HI>Spain;</HI> But we mu&s;t then ask, Suppo&s;e a War with the <HI>Turks</HI> fall upon him? the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> is indeed Potent, but was never able to &s;tand again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Empire, which, by this War with <HI>France,</HI> is render'd unable, not to A&s;&s;i&s;t only, but even to Defend her &s;elf.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Elector Palatine is already a Member of the Confederacy, and all the Power of his Dominions is exerted in the War already, we have 12000 of his Men in the Army in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> 8000 in the Garri&s;ons and Army on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> 6000 in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;o that his Hereditary Power would be no addition to the Confedera|cy, to make up the lo&s;s of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>The next Prince that had any view this way, is King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and it is true, he is a powerful Prince, whether we reckon his Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> or no; and perhaps more Powerful without, than with the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> as things now &s;tand; becau&s;e, were he $word$ be cho&s;en Emperor without the Kingdom of <HI>Pland,</HI> he would immediately come into good
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Terms with the <HI>Swede;</HI> who upon Replacing King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> would, no doubt, give King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> very good Conditions of Peace, and back his Pretentions to the Empire. But as it is, in League with the <HI>Czaar,</HI> and in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Poland,</HI> none of the Princes of the Empire can be thought to be willing to make him Em|peror,</P>

All the World will readily allow, that to place the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> in the Imperial Throne, and give him <HI>Spain</HI> too, is ju&s;t &s;etting up the Exorbitant Power we have been &s;o long a pulling down.

<P>The other Branch in the Emperor de&s;cending by Succe&s;&s;ion to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> II. came to &s;uch a height, that the Empire became Chain'd to his Sword, the Liberties of <HI>Germany</HI> &s;unk under the Terrour of General <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Army; till the Uni|ver&s;al Ruin of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t being at the Door, and the Sack of the City of <HI>Magde|burgh</HI> making them de&s;perate, the famous <HI>Con|clu&s;ions of Leip&s;ick</HI> were made; the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was Invited over, and the Great Battle of <HI>Leip|&s;ick</HI> fought, where the Imperial Army, <HI>Invincible till then,</HI> was entirely overthrown; and that War was afterwards carried on with incredible Suc|ce&s;s, till the Liberties of <HI>Germany</HI> were entirely re&s;tored by the Treaty of <HI>Mun&s;ter, Anno</HI> 1648.</P>

<P>And fir&s;t let them tell us what the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> will &s;ay to it: It is not for an Author in Print to tell the World po&s;itively what a So|vereign Prince will, or will not do: But tho' we mean &s;o perhaps mo&s;t directly, we &s;hall put it into other Terms thus; Suppo&s;e it a Privy Councellor of the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> giving his Opinion to his Ma&s;ter in Words like the&s;e:</P>
<P>Sir, Your Royal Highne&s;s's Dominions being &s;eated as it were in the Center, between three mighty Powers or Potentates, <HI>viz.

<P>Your Country being without Compari&s;on, Inferiour to any one of the three, and border|ing upon the Dominions of them all, nothing is more E&s;&s;ential to your Highne&s;&s;es Intere&s;t, than to keep up the &s;aid Antipathies, and prevent

the Conjunction of any two of the &s;aid Powers into one, for that by Con&s;equence tho&s;e two &s;o joyned, over-powering the third, will De&s;troy you.</P>
<P>Wherefore if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould offer to be Elected Emperor, without relinqui&s;hing his Claim to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, your Royal Highne&s;s ought immediately to joyn all your Power with &s;ome other; whether <HI>France,</HI> or any el&s;e to prevent it.</P>
<P>Nor let any Man think the D&mdash;of <HI>S&mdash;y</HI> &s;o blind to his own &s;afety, as not to li&s;ten to &s;uch Advice as this, or rather &s;o blind as not to &s;ee without any body's Advice, that this is his true Intere&s;t, and the only way to prevent his De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Come we next to the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> of whom we have an Account already, That the <HI>French</HI> have &s;et on Foot a Negotiation to Unite them in a League again&s;t the Encroachments of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> The mighty Power of the Emperor, and the probability there has been of that Power being doubled, by the &s;et|ting up King <HI>Charles</HI> on the Throne of <HI>Spain,</HI> has &s;tirr'd up the Inclination of tho&s;e Princes to form &s;uch a League; and nothing but the fear of that Power, and the apprehen&s;ions they have, lea&s;t <HI>France</HI> may not be able to protect them in their new Engagements, has prevent|ed the Execution of it.</P>
<P>But &s;hall we think that upon &s;uch a Con|juncture as this, if King <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould attempt to Unite the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and Imperial Crown again in one Head, the Rea&s;ons which moved before, will not double in their Strength,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
e&s;pecially while the fears that prevented the fini&s;hing that De&s;ign &s;hall ju&s;tly vani&s;h by the Death of the Emperor, and the fir&s;t Difficulties that appear in &s;ettling &s;o great an Event?</P>
<P>Let us Examine the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Italy</HI> a little, with re&s;pect to their Affection to the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatne&s;s:</P>
<P N="1">1. The Pope, he is Exa&s;perated to the highe&s;t Degree by the In&s;ults of the <HI>Germans</HI> in many re&s;pects; their Seizing of <HI>Commacchio,</HI> Rai&s;ing Infinite Contributions, Pillaging and Plunder|ing on the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Territories and the Lands of the Church; falling upon him by force of Arms, and obliging his Holine&s;s to Disbur&s;e large Sums to Disband his Forces, and pay the <HI>Germans</HI> Quarters by the Ruin of his Subjects of the <HI>Bologne&s;e</HI> and <HI>Ferrare&s;e,</HI> without any Sa|tisfaction; the City of <HI>Cammachio</HI> being not yet re&s;tored to him, but the Preten&s;ions of the Duke of <HI>Modena</HI> Privately &s;upported again&s;t him, as a pretence to keep a long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and at la&s;t to draw a great Sum of Money out of his Hands.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e things, the Pope has receiv'd Infinite Mortifications, as in the Marching of Count <HI>Thaun</HI> the Emperor's General with the Imperial Army to the Conque&s;t of <HI>Naples:</HI> Not thro' the Territories of the Church only, but even into the Gates of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> with|out asking the Pope leave; the Ravages and Di&s;orders of the <HI>Germans</HI> in their March; the Contributions and the Quartering of Soldiers in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick State, and the haughty Car|riage of the Imperial Mini&s;ter the Marquis <HI>de Prie,</HI> in the &s;everal Treaties for the Accomo|dation of tho&s;e Grievances.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
The&s;e and many more, added to the Native Inclinations of the Pope to the Intere&s;t of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, in all the Debates between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> have been Morti|fications &s;ufficient, to make his Holyne&s;s glad of any occa&s;ion to ca&s;t off the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Austrian</HI> Yoke; but much more, when it &s;hall appear that the doubling the Power of that Yoke is Tran&s;acting as above, by Joyning the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy to the Emperor in one Head.</P>
<P>The Great Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> has been under like Di&s;&s;atisfactions as the Pope, tho' not &s;o much provoked; and the Payment of 50000 Pi&s;toles every year Contribution to the <HI>Germans,</HI> has been always prote&s;ted again&s;t by his Highne&s;s, as an Inju&s;tice, and which he &s;ubmitted to, meer|ly by the Violence and Power of the Imperial Armies, not with any &s;ence of its being a Legal Demand. And the &s;aid Duke, having all along been a Neuteral Prince, will, it's to be fear'd, come into &s;uch Mea&s;ures as may prevent his be|ing oblig'd to quit his mo&s;t advantageous Neu|trality, by which his Port of <HI>Leghorn</HI> enjoys more Trade at this time than the City of <HI>Venice,</HI> and more by Ten times than ever it did before.</P>
<P>The <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> are in the &s;ame Grievance, of whom, tho' no part of their Territory lyes in the Seat of the War, yet 40000 Pi&s;toles have been Annually extorted, for Contributions to the <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can it but be feared, that all the re&s;t of the Petty Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> will take ju&s;t Umbrage at a Conjunction of Power, which as it is now, is formidable to them; but as it will be then, may effectually devour them; e&s;peci|ally &s;ince <HI>France,</HI> which was, in former times, the

only defence again&s;t the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatne&s;s, &s;hall be &s;o reduc'd, as to be in no Capacity to Relieve them in &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Calabria,</HI> are, on the other hand, a living and vi&s;ible Motive to their Apprehen&s;ions, who&s;e Groans under the <HI>German</HI> Government, are &s;o loud, that the Viceroy expecting every hour they &s;hould ri&s;e in Arms, is Night and Day watching and guard|ing again&s;t the Surprize.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>S&mdash;y</HI> comes in again to the number of the&s;e; who, notwith&s;tanding the great and faithful Services done to the Com|mon Cau&s;e and the mighty Lo&s;&s;es &s;uffer'd in the Ravaging his Country Demoli&s;hing his For|tre&s;&s;es, <HI>(viz.) errue, Verciel, Montmellian</HI> and o|thers, with the Siege of his Capital of <HI>Turin,</HI> yet has, in Three years &s;olicitation, not been able to obtain the Inve&s;titure of the little Country of <HI>Vigevano, about as big as the County of Middle|&s;ex,</HI> tho' the Agreement of giving it up to him, pa&s;t at <HI>Milan,</HI> upon his Second Alliance.</P>
<P>The Republic of <HI>Venice,</HI> Politic and Wary, have hither to kept them&s;elves out of the Broil; but &s;hould they &s;ee this &s;tep going to be taken, they are too Penetrating not to know, they &s;hall be no longer in a Condition to refu&s;e the Imperiali&s;ts pa&s;&s;age thro' the <HI>Verone&s;e,</HI> or to maintain their Neutrality; they cannot &s;o early forget, how the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> General <HI>Cordonaa,</HI> Ravaged their whole Dominions on the <HI>Terrae Firma,</HI> Cannonaded <HI>Venice</HI> it &s;elf from the Main Land, and Beat <HI>Seignior Bartholomew Alvi|ano</HI> at the Great Battle of <HI>Vineenza.</HI> The&s;e therefore will certainly joyn in oppo&s;ing the Conjunction.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
Thus <HI>France</HI> gains the D&mdash;of <HI>S</HI>&mdash;, Re-enters <HI>Italy,</HI> brings all the Princes into a League, which this year he has been di&s;appoint|ed in, and of which the <HI>French</HI> will be Garran|tees; and all the work on that Side, may be to be done over again.</P>
<P>Come we next to the Elector <HI>Palatine:</HI> He is Uncle to the late Emperor by the Mother's Side, being the Empre&s;s <HI>Dowager</HI>'s Own Bro|ther, and the only Prince, in the Temporal Election, who is in any probable Po&s;ture of putting in for the Imperial Crown; and as he may &s;eem to Rival his Nephew King <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;o, we may be a&s;&s;ur'd, &s;hould he do &s;o, he will take all tho&s;e for his Enemies that &s;hall Oppo&s;e him. The Power of this Prince, it is confe&s;s'd, is not Great; but as he may expect in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, to add the Electorate of <HI>Bavaria</HI> to him&s;elf upon &s;uch an Advancement, it will con&s;iderably add to him, and it cannot be doubted but he would be very well &s;upported on this &s;ide: But &s;hould the Preten&s;ions of his Nephew King <HI>Charles</HI> be pu&s;h'd on, and at the &s;ame time the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> be re&s;erv'd to him al&s;o, this Prince, might be found among the number of tho&s;e that would Oppo&s;e, as adding a Power to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> which none of the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> ever can de&s;ire to &s;ee them a Se|cond time po&s;&s;e&s;t of.</P>
<P>We might here al&s;o enquire, what the Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Saxony</HI> and of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> would think to be their Intere&s;t in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this? and if we may &s;uppo&s;e they will Judge, by what their Ance&s;tors felt under the Exorbi|tant Greatne&s;s of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria;</HI> From which, had they not been deliver'd by the

Great <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> there had by this time been no &s;uch thing as an Election of an Emperor to be made. If they may, <HI>We &s;ay,</HI> be &s;uppos'd to make a Judgment by the Antient Mi&s;eries of their Country, they will, One and All, Oppo&s;e the making any Man Emperor, who &s;hall &s;o much as make a pretence to the Monar|chy of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus in a brief manner related &s;ome|thing of the Intere&s;t of the Re&s;pective Princes and Powers concern'd in the Affair of the Empire; we come to enquire a little, what it can be rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e is the Intere&s;t of King <HI>Charles</HI> him&s;elf? and in what man|ner he ought, to act upon this Juncture? We have not yet toucht at what the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch, French</HI> or <HI>Swedes,</HI> may have in view re|lating to this matter; We &s;hall come to it of Cour&s;e, when We &s;hall con&s;ider the Intere&s;t of the Confederacy in General, as it &s;tands now involved in a Bloody War again&s;t <HI>French</HI> Power, and may be Influenc'd by the Election, one way or other, of an Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> which indeed will not be a little.</P>
<P>But before we come to this, it &s;eems proper to enquire a little, what the King of <HI>Spain</HI> will or will not do in this nice Conjuncture: By what he will do, is not to be under&s;tood, as if we pre|tended to foretell what Mea&s;ures he will take, or to be of his Council; But rather, as in the Head before is expre&s;t, what he &s;hou'd do, what, as things appear, and as the World now &s;tands, complexly con&s;ider'd, it is his Intere&s;t to do, and what he ought to do for his own Advan|tage, and the Peace of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
We do confe&s;s it &s;eems a difficult thing to Determine on the &s;ide of King <HI>Charles,</HI> becau&s;e of the uncertain Circum&s;tances of his Affairs at this time; for if he relinqui&s;hes his preten|&s;ions to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy&punc; in order to be cho&s;en Emperor, and &s;hould fail of that al&s;o, then he lo&s;es by the Choice, and mu&s;t &s;it down by his Hereditary Dominions; in which if he &s;hould have the <HI>Turks</HI> and Malecontents of <HI>Hungary</HI> to deal with all, his Hereditary Do|minions being Frontiers to the Empire; he may be ill'able to defend him&s;elf without the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Emperor that &s;hall be Elected, which Emperor, if he (K. <HI>Charles)</HI> has fir&s;t oppo&s;ed in his Election, maybe little enclin'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and perhaps willing enough to &s;ee his Power le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>On the other hand, It &s;eems hard to expect of him, that he &s;hould relinqui&s;h his Claim or Preten&s;ions to the Empire, the peaceable po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of which would place him in &s;o great a figure in the World, and the War being happily ended, would render him the fir&s;t Soveraign in <HI>Europe,</HI> and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the mo&s;t powerful. Neither do we undertake to determine which, or how many of the Hereditary Dominions of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> de&s;cends to K. <HI>Charles</HI> by the Emperor's Death, the two Arch-Dutche&s;&s;es, Daughters to his Maje&s;ty, being alive; but for Ar|gument &s;ake will &s;uppo&s;e them all to be his own.</P>
<P>And here I think this Prince may reflect with &s;ome regret upon the ob&s;tinacy of &s;ome of his Friends in the World, who would not con&s;ent to Peace, upon the lea&s;t di&s;membring of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy; which if it had been done, he had now been &s;ettled in that part, and left free to pu&s;h his Fortunes for the Empire, on the foot of his <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">
But this is pa&s;t, we come now to enquire what is the pre&s;ent Intere&s;t of King <HI>Charles</HI> III And this is to be con&s;ider'd in General, and in Particular.</P>
<P>In General&punc; and ab&s;tracted from his Allies, it is no doubt his Intere&s;t to be both Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as it is all Mens Intere&s;t to make them&s;elves as Rich, as Great, and as Powerful as they can; and yet even in General, it is his Intere&s;t not &s;o to Gra&s;p at All, as to Lo&s;e All.

<P>1<HI>&s;t.</HI> There is no doubt it is the Intere&s;t of King <HI>Charles</HI> to po&s;t away to <HI>Vienna</HI> with all &s;peed, and to u&s;e all his Intere&s;t, and all his Friends, to be Cho&s;en Emperor; no$ is there any great que&s;tion of his obtaining the Choice, as the Affairs of <HI>Germany</HI> now &s;tand; no Prince pretending to it, being of equal Power to De|fend and Support the Empire in its pre&s;ent Embarra&s;sment, as a Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria:</HI> So that not only his own Intere&s;t, but the Intere&s;t of all the Electors, and the Intere&s;t of the Allies too, <HI>of which I &s;hall &s;peak by it &s;elf,</HI> &s;eem to concurr in offering to him the Imperial Dignity.

<P>It needs not that we look back to Con&s;ider how great an Ob&s;truction the&s;e things remaining un&s;ettled have been to the Affairs of the War: How long the refu&s;ing to the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> the Inve&s;titure, or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>&V;pper Pala|tinate, tho' it was the Inheritance of his Ancestors, and unjustly given away to the Duke of Bavaria,</HI> retarded the March of his Troops to the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Allies; and kept 22000 Men out of the Army: How long the refu&s;ing to accept the Guarrantee of the Confederates in the Treaty with the Malecontents in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> has kept the War on Foot there, Diverting above 30000 Imperial Troops from the pre&s;ent War; which had they been employ'd on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> had long before now reduc'd the King of <HI>France</HI> to Terms of Peace: How long a mo&s;t ridicu|lous Nicety, at lea&s;t we think &s;o, about the In|ve&s;ting the D&mdash;of <HI>S</HI>&mdash;in the Fief of <HI>Vigevano,</HI> has &s;av'd <HI>Dauphine</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> by Di&s;&s;atisfying and Cooling that Prince in the Pro&s;ecution of the War, and &s;o Di&s;gu&s;ting him, as that he hath declin'd now for two Campaigns to take the field in Per&s;on, or pu&s;h the <HI>French</HI> in &s;uch a manner, as it is not doubted he had otherwi&s;e done.</P>
<P>The&s;e are things, which as they are of Infi|nite Concern to the Intere&s;t of the Confedera|cy, &s;o it cannot be doubted but King <HI>Charles,</HI> when he remembers the great Obligations he is already, and may hereafter be under to the Al|lies, will think him&s;elf bound in Gratitude to Con&s;ider, and to Remove the Difficulties which <HI>Europe</HI> has &s;o long labour'd under on that ac|count.</P>

<P>But the main thing in which we &s;ay it is his Intere&s;t to give Satisfaction to the Confede|rates, is, in his con&s;enting to a new Concert of Mea&s;ures; for the pre&s;ent claim to the Crown of <HI>Spain; whether,</HI> to remain in him&s;elf with &s;uch Re&s;trictions and Appointments as &s;hall be concerted by the General Con&s;ent, and as may make <HI>Europe</HI> ea&s;ie; or to Relinqui&s;h and Demit the &s;ame in favour of &s;uch other Branch of his Hou&s;e, as &s;hall be by the &s;ame general Con&s;ent agreed and concerted.</P>

Princes and Powers, now Zealous for the Con|federacy, will not ea&s;ily come into it, but may oppo&s;e it with all their Power, and perhaps, for|&s;ake their Engagement with us in the Common Cau&s;e&punc; if they find it in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>We need not repeat the Names and Intere&s;t of the&s;e: The Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> have a more than ordinary Concern in this, with all the Prote&s;tant Electors, and Princes of <HI>Germany;</HI> and if the Elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> comes into Mea&s;ures, we mu&s;t believe he rather acts in Complai&s;ance to the mea|&s;ures of the Maritime Powers, than by the Dictates of his <HI>German</HI> Intere&s;t, or of his Judgment.</P>
<P>We come next, to the Intere&s;t of the Con|federates in this great turn of Affairs; it is a great Point, and requires to be con&s;idred many ways.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t. Complexly</HI> or as a Confederacy, and here we may examine how the Intere&s;t of the Grand Alliance &s;tands, <HI>as &s;uch.</HI></P>
<P>As the Grand Alliance is only a Concert of Mea&s;ures among the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> the principle part of tho&s;e Princes being United in One Body, to carry on a War for the main|taining the Liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI> and reducing the Exorbitant Power of <HI>France;</HI> become by his Innumerable Acce&s;&s;ion, a Terror to his Neighbour, and Dangerous to the whole Body.

<P>Yet this is not their Intere&s;t immediately, as a Confederacy, on account of the Family of
<PB N="31" REF="32">
<HI>Au&s;tria</HI> only, any more than to any other Prince equally &s;teddy to the Confederacy; &s;o much as it is &s;o, on the account that no other Prince can be &s;uppos'd to ri&s;e to that Degree, without &s;ome Intrigue, Difficulty, Oppo&s;ition, and per|haps, breaking the Intere&s;t that is now &s;o well United.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly. Separately,</HI> Con&s;idering the Re&s;pective Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> as Members of the Grand Alliance, their Intere&s;ts perhaps may all be brought to a Center in the Election of King <HI>Charles</HI> to the Empire; but Con&s;ider them apart, we &s;hall find few, if any of them, willing to have the Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> added to the Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> in one and the &s;ame Soveraign. This then is the pre&s;ent Enquiry before us, <HI>viz.</HI> How &s;tands the &s;everal Princes Confederated together in this War, Affected to this new Step, and what is their Intere&s;t, as it re&s;pects the advancement of this Prince to the Imperial Throne? We mean their Intere&s;t in their &s;epa|rate Capacity.</P>
<P>We have touch'd already at the Greatne&s;s of the Hou&s;e <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and the Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s, and Ex|orbitance of it, and need not repeat it; we men|tion it only to di&s;tingui&s;h in our Arguing, why the&s;e or tho&s;e, are of this or that Opinion. And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible the Prote&s;tant Prin|ces of <HI>Germany,</HI> if their Eyes are open, can be for &s;uch a mon&s;trous encrea&s;e to the Power of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria: Con&s;ider'd, as before, out of the pre&s;ent Confederacy.</HI></P>
<P>We hinted at this before; we do not &s;peak it Reflecting upon the pre&s;ent King <HI>Charles,</HI> but when a Prince may come to the Throne, who knows not JOSEPH, or when this Prince
<PB N="32" REF="33">
may forget that ever he knew JOSEPH, for Ingratitude hath generally a very bad Memory; when &s;uch a thing happens, the $&s;&s;i&s;tance given, the Support afforded, the Powers lent to ad|vance the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria</HI> to the Throne, may be &s;oon forgotten and laid a&s;leep: For this Rea&s;on we &s;ay, they cannot con&s;ent to &s;uch a Mon&s;trous encrea&s;e of Power; and all People will allow it a good Rea&s;on to Act by, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The probabillity of Po&s;terity &s;inking under the Power they Unwarily Rai&s;e up. The Prote&s;tant Prin|ces of <HI>Germany</HI> are not Di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the re&s;t in this Ca&s;e, only that we think, they have more e&s;pecial Rea&s;on to remember what they felt under the Exorbitance of that very Fami|ly we now &s;peak of.</P>
<P>The Princes and States of <HI>Italy</HI> are next, the&s;e indeed were not &s;o irrecoverably In|volv'd or Swallow'd up in the Intere&s;t and Power of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Greatne&s;s, becau&s;e they had the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>French,</HI> in the Struggles they made to Deliver them&s;elves; the Power of <HI>France</HI> having three or four times Po&s;&s;e&s;t and Re-po&s;&s;e&s;t the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> and Twice the Kingdom of <HI>Naples:</HI> Yet in the Interval of this A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and particularly when <HI>Francis</HI> I. King of <HI>France,</HI> was Pri&s;oner to the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. at the Battle of <HI>Pavia,</HI> then we find <HI>Rome</HI> Be&s;ieg'd and Taken by A&s;&s;ault; <HI>Genoa</HI> Storm'd, and given to the Plunder of the Imperial Soldiers; <HI>Millain</HI> De&s;olated by the Plague brought thi|ther by the <HI>Germans,</HI> and Reduc'd Twice to ex|tremity of Famine; <HI>Naples</HI> mi&s;erably Harrasd with Sieges and A&s;&s;aults; and in &s;hort, <HI>Italy</HI> in General Overwhelm'd by the <HI>Austrian</HI> Great|ne&s;s, and never obtaining any Relaxation of

its Mi&s;eries, but by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>French,</HI> who in their turn, made the &s;ame Havock of their Liberties and their Country, and made them pay dear for the Deliverance they brought them.</P>
<P>No Man can think the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes can acquie&s;ce at the Conjunction of <HI>Spain</HI> to the Im|perial Power; and we name it again, <HI>having &s;poken of this in the first part of this Tract,</HI> upon this account: We are told that the <HI>French,</HI> had already been attempting to concert a League, or private Confederacy between the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> in order to pre&s;erve their Liberties from Subjection to the growing Power of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria;</HI> which League, they &s;ay, was in a fair way of being brought to Perfection, but has been undermin'd and render'd abortive, by the Imperial Councils on that &s;ide: But if this attempt of Joyning the Empire and <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould be made, the <HI>French</HI> have &s;uch an unan|&s;werable Argument to u&s;e to the <HI>Venetian,</HI> the Pope, and the Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> who were the Three Powers &s;uppos'd to form that League, that it is to be fear'd they may, with more ea&s;e, bring &s;uch a League to pa&s;s at this time than ever.</P>
<P>We come next to con&s;ider the Intere&s;t on this &s;ide, &s;uch as of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> the Two Powers, on whom we may, without a&s;&s;uming &s;ay, the weight of the pre&s;ent War, and the Pro|te&s;tant Intere&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI> depends. It is true, that the&s;e Powers are not &s;o immediately con|cern'd in the Opre&s;&s;ions which may happen from the Exorbitant Power of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Austria,</HI> and this makes &s;ome People among us think little of the Danger, it being at a great di&s;tance, not of place only, but remote in time
<PB N="34" REF="35">
al&s;o; for the People of this Age, are remark able for their being more than ever regardle&s;s of things to come, yet we are not unconcern'd in it, and therefore ought to be very wary how we a&s;&s;i&s;t in laying the Foundation of &s;uch a Power, as we may one day be very forward to pull down again.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome People pi&s;h at this thought, and tell us, The Scene of <HI>Europe</HI> is now Chang'd: that we are not in &s;uch Danger of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> as we were then; that the powerful Figure the King of <HI>France</HI> makes in the World is a &s;ufficient Ballance to it all; and, that tho' it were &s;o, our Affairs &s;tand &s;o now, that we cannot help it, we mu&s;t run the venture.</P>
<P>To this we may an&s;wer however, that we ought to be very wary of erecting &s;uch a Power in <HI>Europe,</HI> as may one day be too Great for tho&s;e that &s;et it up to pull down; That there are &s;ome Con&s;iderations to be thought of in this Ca&s;e. Such as the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">1. That a time may come, and has been long wi&s;hed for in <HI>Europe</HI> by the Popi&s;h Powers, when a War of Religion &s;hall be &s;et on Foot in Chri&s;tendom; and that if the Empire and <HI>Spain</HI> comes to be united in one head, whenever Po|pi&s;h Zeal &s;hould prompt them to Unite with <HI>France,</HI> to extirpate the <HI>Northern Here&s;y</HI> as it is called, we &s;hould find the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t &s;o weakned by this Conjunction, that we &s;hould be ill able to maintain our ground again&s;t &s;uch an United Force.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>England</HI> perhaps as little dreamt of the Danger from the great encrea&s;e of <HI>French</HI> Power, when our Shipwrights, and Moulds of our Men of War, Docks, Yards, &amp;c. were lent to the
<PB N="35" REF="36">
King of <HI>France,</HI> as we may think of the encrea&s;e of the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Greatne&s;s in Uniting <HI>Spain</HI> and the Empire. I have heard Wi&s;e Polititians Quarrel, both the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> for what they have done this way to the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> and tell us, that one time or other, he may bring his Naval Power to be a Terror to us all. King <HI>Charles</HI> II. however &s;ome Peo|ple may Reflect upon his Memory, could never be &s;uch an Enemy to his Country, as to De&s;ign that <HI>France</HI> &s;hould, by his means, beat us at Sea, and co&s;t us Twenty Five Years War to Re|duce. No Wi&s;e Nation will ever build up a Power on purpo&s;e to pull down again, or lay a Foundation, that others may build upon with|out their leave, and be too &s;trong for them to di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P N="3">3. The view of &s;uch a Conjunction may, and 'tis more than probable will, break off &s;ome con&s;iderable Branches from the general Confe|deracy, which may have its immediate ill Con|&s;equences, and Weaken, in&s;tead of Strength|ning the Hands of the Allies, in the pur&s;uit of the Common Cau&s;e again&s;t the Exorbitant Power of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In all the Councils of this Age, and e&s;pe|cially of this War, it has been a Fundamental Article, That no &s;uch Conjunction could be Convenient, or for the Intere&s;t or Peace of <HI>Europe;</HI> and the Treaty of Partition is Particu|larly a Proof of this, in the Ninth Article of which, it is Re&s;olv'd by the King of <HI>France,</HI> the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> as a Fundamental of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Peace, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Po&s;terity, and to prevent the breaking out of new Conte&s;ts among the Princes

and Powers concern'd, <HI>That no Conjunctions of Kingdoms &s;hould be form'd:</HI> And to this end it is expre&s;ly Stipulated, That if &s;uch or &s;uch Prin|ces &s;hould die without I&s;&s;ue, to whom &s;uch or &s;uch Succe&s;&s;ions are Limited and Determin'd, then to de&s;cen'd to the Heirs <HI>So</HI> and <HI>So;</HI> But with this Re&s;erve, that the Kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould never devolve to the &s;ame Per&s;on that was Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> on one hand, or King of <HI>France</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e things it &s;eems very plain, that what&s;oever the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the Confederacy may make rea&s;onable to yield to, in order to carry the main Point of Reducing the King of <HI>France,</HI> yet that it can by no means be for the Intere&s;t, either of <HI>Europe</HI> in general, the Confederacy in particular, or of the Prote&s;tant part of it in e&s;pecial manner, to joyn the va&s;t extended Dominions of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Empire, in one Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>To make this out, let us take a &s;hort view of the immen&s;e Greatne&s;s of that Hou&s;e if &s;o United, and what trifling Ob&s;tructions there will be then in the way, to prevent their fini&s;h|ing by Conque&s;t, &s;uch a Figure, as the Chri&s;tian World mu&s;t &s;ome time or other &s;ink under.</P>

<P>To ob&s;truct the Conjunction of the&s;e Domi|nions what is there to be named?

<P>Upon this Notion of the <HI>Ballance of Power,</HI> &s;uch &s;teps as the&s;e have been taken; the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was to be Tran&s;planted from his Dominions in <HI>Germany</HI> to the Dutchy of <HI>Millan,</HI> and placed to Govern a People who&s;e Language he did not under&s;tand; and upon this Notion, this or that Kingdom or Province, was to be appointed this Prince, and this to another, not as the Claim of the Per&s;ons Directed, but as the Square of Dominion, the Safety of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Ballance of Power made it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>And is all this Nece&s;&s;ity &s;unk? Is all the mighty Force of the Great Rule, which Guided the Nations before, lo&s;t at once? Is there no more need of a Ballance of Power in <HI>Europe?</HI> This &s;eems unaccountably &s;trange, and mu&s;t be the effect of want of Con&s;ideration to the high|e&s;t Degree, in the Politicians of this Day; and &s;hould the Notion prevail, it will without doubt, furni&s;h the King of <HI>France</HI> with Argu|ments too powerful for &s;ome Princes in the World to re&s;i&s;t; by which, if he &s;hould bring them over to e&s;pou&s;e his Intere&s;t, it may give

us a Shock at la&s;t in our De&s;igns, and bid fair for undoing what has co&s;t <HI>Europe</HI> &s;o much Blood and Trea&s;ure to bring thus far on.</P>
<P>We come now to Con&s;ider what Medium may be found out, to &s;ettle this Affair to the General Satisfaction of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o as to remove the Jealou&s;ies of our Friends, take away the Advantages of our Enemies, their opportunity of Dividing us, or being able to render the Confederates, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;u&s;pected to one another.</P>
<P>It does not belong to a Common ob&s;ervor to pre&s;cribe Methods in things of this moment, nor can it in the compa&s;s of the&s;e Sheets be expect|ed, that the Scheme of Accomodating &s;o great a matter &s;hould be Drawn at full length; But &s;omething may be done as an E&s;&s;ay, for wi&s;er and more penetrating Heads to work upon.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Project we meet with of this kind, is to make the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> immediately upon the Advancement of the pre&s;ent King <HI>Charles</HI> III. to the Imperial Dig|nity.</P>
<P>Let us Con&s;ider the Propo&s;al it &s;elf fir&s;t, and then in all its Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. They tell us this is Con&s;ider'd in the Grand Alliance, and that it has been Determin'd al|ready, that in &s;uch Ca&s;e the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;hall be Declar'd King of <HI>Spain;</HI> but in this Article, they do not &s;ay one word of what Title, Claim, or Pretence the &s;aid Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> makes to this Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> or upon what Foot it &s;tands; if we &s;ay the Confederates by meer Concert, and of their own Authority, as Allies, &s;hall undertake to &s;ay who &s;hall, or who &s;hall
<PB N="41" REF="42">
not enjoy &s;uch a Crown, we &s;hall then make the Confederates Admini&s;trators of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mo|narchy, and place the Right of Succe&s;&s;ion in them, which we do not find in the lea&s;t that they pretend to: It may be true, that the Con|federates may Concern them&s;elves in the Nega|tive, for preventing the Union of &s;uch and &s;uch Dominions in one Head; but to form Titles, or give Kingdoms to &s;uch or &s;uch Princes, whe|ther they Derive to tho&s;e Crowns by Legal De&s;cent or no, is not (according to the General notion of things) in the Power of the Confede|rates.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this would be to Recognize the Le|gallity of a Gift, which is the Title King <HI>Philip</HI> Claims by, and indeed was the Grand Objection again&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI> the Third's Title, &s;o long as the Emperor, his Brother, was alive: This we find hone&s;tly &s;tated, and boldly too, the Times Co&s;ider'd, by a known Author in this Town, in the&s;e Words, or in Words to this Effect:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;There is no doubt, &s;ays he, that the Right of the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> is in the Augu&s;t Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI></Q> But if it be a right <HI>Jure Devoluto,</HI> as it is apparent to be, then it only De&s;cends to the Heir, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Elde&s;t Son; and this gives the Title to the Emperor and his Heir Male: From whom it is not in the Power of the Emperor him&s;elf, by any Deed, Gift, or Convention, to Alienate that Suc|ce&s;&s;ion. If his Imperial Maje&s;ty will not take upon him the Admini&s;tration, his Children, Male or Female, have the Right; and we do not find, but <HI>Spain</HI> may be Govern'd by a Queen, as was apparent in the Reign of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> Queen
<PB N="42" REF="43">
of <HI>Castile,</HI> and <HI>Joanna,</HI> Widow of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> Mother of <HI>Charles</HI> the Vth, and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> I.</P>
<P>But if the Emperor for Rea&s;ons of State, and in Compliance with the Allies, did not think fit to take the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to him|&s;elf, it does not appear that his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty had any legal Authority to give the &s;ame to his Brother King <HI>Ch</HI>&mdash;III, which had been a manife&s;t Di&s;inheriting his own Sons if he had or &s;hould have any, as was not at all improbable. But if we are oppos'd here, and told, that he had a legal Authority to make a deed of Gift of the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> cutting off the Entail from his own Po&s;tery, then have we been doing wrong in this whole War; and Injuring <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Anjou</HI> King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who Claims by the &s;ame Title of Gift, had that Gift prior to King <HI>Ch</HI>&mdash;, and thereby had the Entail cut off from King <HI>Ch</HI>&mdash;, his Gift coming from the Rightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>If then King <HI>Charles</HI> II. had no Right at his Death, to will or give the Crown in bar of the Rightful Heirs, who were the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> neither could the Emperor <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> give from Him&s;elf and his Heirs, the &s;ame Crown to his Younger Brother, cutting off thereby the En|tail from his own Children: But on the other hand, If the Emperor had a Rightful Authori|ty to give, as above, the Crown to his Younger Brother <HI>Ch</HI>&mdash;III. him&s;elf then alive, and likely to have Children; by the &s;ame Parity of Rea&s;on King <HI>Ch</HI>&mdash;II. of <HI>Spain,</HI> had a Right|ful Authority to make a Will, and give the Crown to <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Anjou,</HI> in bar of the Claim of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> or any Body el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">
The matter &s;tanding thus, and the&s;e Argu|ments &s;uppos'd to be good, we may &s;ay without Offence, that King <HI>Ch</HI>&mdash;III. had really no ju&s;t Claim to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> before, his Elder Brother being then alive.</P>
<P>But if we allow, That the Crown ought to de&s;cend Lineally, and cannot by any of the Rightful Heirs be given away, by this we in|deed are now upon a right foot, That <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Anjou</HI> has no Legal Claim, and the Title and Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> is Legally and Lineally De|&s;cended to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> who&s;e Head, and Rightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, is now <HI>Ch</HI>&mdash;III. King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>From this Principle however, this Inconve|nience follows, That no Man can appoint the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Spain</HI> from King <HI>Ch</HI>&mdash;III. nei|ther can he demit the &s;aid Crown in favour of any other, thereby cutting off his own Children or other Heirs, whether Born or to be Born.</P>
<P>By this Doctrine he mu&s;t be both King and Emperor; but becau&s;e the World is not at pre|&s;ent &s;o Nice, and the&s;e things may or may not be admitted, we &s;hall put it both ways; and &s;tate &s;uch Mediums, as that the Powers now to be E&s;tabli&s;h'd, may not be made a Terror to <HI>Europe,</HI> one way or other: And this is upon the foot of a <HI>Partition,</HI> for it can be no other way.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Son of the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> be declared King of <HI>Spain</HI> to Him and his Heirs, with all the Dominions thereof, except as hereafter, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h-Netherlands,</HI> to be &s;e|que&s;tred to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> as an everla&s;t|ing Barrier between them; and <HI>France, Dunkirk,</HI> and <HI>Newport</HI> only excepted, to be Re&s;tor'd to <HI>England:</HI> On Condition neverthele&s;s that he

Marry the late Emperor's Elde&s;t Daughte</P>
<P>The Dutchy of <HI>Millain,</HI> to be added by <HI>Spa$</HI> to the Principality of <HI>Piemont,</HI> and the Dutchie$ of <HI>Mantua</HI> and <HI>Mirandola,</HI> now under &s;eque &s;tration to the Emperor, to be added by th$ Empire; and the&s;e all, <HI>(viz.) Savoy, Piemont Nice, Finall, Montferat, Millain, Mantua,</HI> and <HI>M$|randola,</HI> erected into one Kingdom of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and given to the pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> with the Title of King, in Reward of his Faithful Servi|ces to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and to de&s;cend to his other Heirs, and in Default of &s;uch Heir, to Prince <HI>Eugeniu.</HI> This would be a Power|ful Barrier, to keep both the <HI>French</HI> and Im|periali&s;ts always a&s;under, and both at a di&s;tance from the re&s;t of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Legallity of the&s;e things, and the cu&s;tom of giving Kingdoms is exploded, as indeed &s;eems mo&s;t Rea&s;onable; then a &s;econd Alotment may be thus, <HI>viz.</HI> to make King <HI>Charles</HI> both Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as by Title and E|lection he is like to be; but then to &s;eparate their &s;everal Dominions, &s;o as that they may not be able to act in Concert to the Terror of <HI>Europe,</HI> as in former Times. <HI>This may be as follows, viz.</HI></P>
<P>That the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> be made King of <HI>Lumbardy as afore&s;aid,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> Here|ditary Governor of the <HI>Spani&s;h Low-Countries,</HI> the Royalty of them to remain to the States General.</P>
<P>This making the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> King, and adding tho&s;e Dominions abovemention'd, has this Effect: That &s;tanding between the Domi|nions of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Empire, it prevents the afore&s;aid Fatal Conjunction of Power, which

<HI>Europe</HI> &s;o much Fears, and has formerly &s;o much Suffer'd under, and is a Kind of Ballance or Umpire between them.</P>
<P>Al&s;o if, upon any Future Treaty with <HI>France,</HI> any part of <HI>Italy, Naples,</HI> or <HI>Scicily,</HI> &s;hould be Conceded to the &s;aid <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Anjou,</HI> the &s;ame <HI>Lombardy,</HI> which would then be a very Powerful Kingdom, would be an effectual Barrier both to one and the other, to keep tho&s;e Powerful Princes of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> or <HI>Germa|ny,</HI> from making <HI>Italy</HI> the Scene of Blood, and the Theater of their Ambition, as in former days it has have been.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome Mediums which may be offer'd for the Stating this Difficult matter, and pre|venting the Evil that <HI>Europe</HI> may have Rea&s;on to apprehend from this unexpected Death of the Emperor; as well from the Advantages <HI>France</HI> may take of this general Di&s;order of <HI>Europe</HI> on this occa&s;ion, as of the Injury a too great Accumulation of Power to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> may bring upon us in Ages to come. And that this may not &s;eem too great an Arro|gance in a private Per&s;on, the Author takes leave to Note, that the&s;e Schemes are drawn from, and with very little difference, are a faithful Ab&s;tract of tho&s;e Original Drafts, from which the late <HI>Treaty of Partition,</HI> which he had the Honour to &s;ee form'd, was after many Con&s;ultations and Alterations Conclu|ded; and which he has &s;till by him to produce.</P>
