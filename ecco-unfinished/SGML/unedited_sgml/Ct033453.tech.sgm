<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON
METHODS for preventing the Ruine
of GREAT-BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE it hath plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it this
Land, and make us feel the fatal Effects
of our Corruption and Folly, it &s;hould be
our care to profit by this Judgment, and
make it an occa&s;ion of our Reformation ra|ther
than of our final Ruin. Sure it is, if we had
been &s;uffered to go on, a few Years longer,
in that full tide of Pro&s;perity, which hath al|ready
&s;o bewitched and debauched the Nation,
we mu&s;t have irretrievably undone our &s;elves,
and grown the &s;ame vile corrupt Slaves, with
tho&s;e who&s;e Vices and Follies we have &s;o
eagerly copied: whereas if warned by our
pre&s;ent Calamities, we &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on the
Cau&s;es that led to them, and remove them by a
contrary Conduct, we may &s;till become a greater
and more flouri&s;hing People than ever; it be|ing
as evident, both from Rea&s;on and Experi|ence,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
that Indu&s;try, Sobriety of Manners,
and the Fear of God build up and pre&s;erve a
People, as that Vice and Irreligion ruin them.
It is therefore heartily to be wi&s;hed that our
Legi&s;lature would, as they love their Coun|try,
think of effectual methods for re&s;toring
and promoting <HI>Religion, Indu&s;try, Frugality,</HI>
and <HI>Public Spirit,</HI> which ever were, and ever
will be, the only &s;ure Foundation of public
Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>RELIGION hath in former days been
cheri&s;hed and reverenced by wi&s;e Patriots and
Lawgivers, as knowing it to be impo&s;&s;ible,
that a Nation &s;hould thrive and flouri&s;h with|out
Virtue, or that Virtue &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out
Con&s;cience, or Con&s;cience without Reli|gion:
in&s;omuch, that an Athei&s;t or Infidel
was looked on with Abhorrence, and treated
as an Enemy to his Country. But in the&s;e
wi&s;er times, a cold Indifference for the natio|nal
Religion, and indeed for all matters of
Faith and divine Wor&s;hip, is thought good
Sen&s;e. It is even become fa&s;hionable to decry
Religion; and that little talent of Ridicule
is applied to &s;uch wrong purpo&s;es, that a good
Chri&s;tian can hardly keep him&s;elf in Counte|nance.</P>
<P>Liberty is the greate&s;t humane Ble&s;&s;ing that
a virtuous Man can po&s;&s;e&s;s, and is very con|&s;i&s;tent
with the Duties of a good Subject and
a good Chri&s;tian. But the pre&s;ent Age a|boundeth
with injudicious Patrons of Liberty,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
who, not di&s;tingui&s;hing between that and
Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, take the &s;ure&s;t Method
to di&s;credit what they would &s;eem to
propagate. For, in effect, can there be a
greater Affront offered to that ju&s;t freedom
of Thought and Action, which is the Prero|gative
of a Rational Creature, or can any
thing recommend it le&s;s to hone&s;t Minds,
than under Colour thereof to obtrude Scurri|lity
and Profanene&s;s on the World? But it
hath been always ob&s;erved of weak Men, that
they know not how to avoid one Extream
without running into another.</P>
<P>Too many of this &s;ort pa&s;s upon vulgar
Readers for great Authors and Men of pro|found
Thought, not on account of any Su|periority
either in Sen&s;e or Style, both which
they po&s;&s;e&s;s in a very moderate degree, nor
of any Di&s;coveries they have made in Arts or
Sciences, which they &s;eem to be little ac|quainted
with: but purely becau&s;e they flat|ter
the Pa&s;&s;ions of corrupt Men, who are
plea&s;ed to have the clamours of Con&s;cience
&s;ilenced, and tho&s;e great points of the Chri|&s;tian
Religion made &s;u&s;pected which with|held
them from many vices of Plea&s;ure and
Intere&s;t, or made them unea&s;y in the com|mi&s;&s;ion
of them.</P>
<P>In order to promote that laudable de&s;ign
of effacing all Sen&s;e of Religion from among
us, they form them&s;elves into A&s;&s;emblies, and
proceed with united Coun&s;els and Endeavours.
With what Succe&s;s, and with what Merit to|wards
the Public, the Effects too plainly
<PB N="4" REF="5">
&s;hew. I will not &s;ay, the&s;e Gentlemen have
formed a direct de&s;ign to ruin their Coun|try,
or that they have the Sen&s;e to &s;ee half
the ill Con&s;equences, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
flow from the &s;preading of their Opini|ons.
But the Nation feels them, and it is
high time the Legi&s;lature put a &s;top to
them.</P>
<P>I am not for placing an invidious Power in
the Hands of the Clergy, or complying with
the Narrowne&s;s of any mi&s;taken Zealots, who
&s;hould incline to per&s;ecute Di&s;&s;enters: but
whatever Conduct, common Sen&s;e as well as
Chri&s;tian Charity obligeth us to u&s;e, towards
tho&s;e who differ from us in &s;ome points of
Religion, yet the public Safety requireth,
that the avowed Contemners of all Religion
&s;hould be &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed. And, perhaps,
it may be no ea&s;y matter to a&s;&s;ign a good
rea&s;on, why Bla&s;phemy again&s;t God &s;hould
not be inquired into and puni&s;hed with the
&s;ame rigour as Trea&s;on again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>For in fine, we may attempt to patch up
our Affairs: but it will be to no purpo&s;e.
The Finger of God will unravel all our vain
Projects, and make them Snares to draw us
into greater Calamities; if we do not reform
that &s;candalous Libertini&s;m, which (whate|ver
&s;ome &s;hallow Men may think) is our wor&s;t
Symptome and the &s;ure&s;t Progno&s;tic of our
Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
INDUSTRY is the natural &s;ure way to
Wealth. This is &s;o true, that it is impo&s;&s;ible
an indu&s;trious free People &s;hould want the
Nece&s;&s;aries and Comforts of Life, or an idle
enjoy them under any form of Government.
Money is &s;o far u&s;eful to the Public, as it
promoteth Indu&s;try; and Credit having the
&s;ame effect, is of the &s;ame value with Mo|ney.
But Money or Credit circulating tho|rough
a Nation from Hand to Hand, with|out
producing Labour and Indu&s;try in the In|habitants,
is direct Gaming.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible for cunning Men to make
&s;uch plau&s;ible Schemes, as may draw tho&s;e
who are le&s;s skilful into their own and the
public Ruin. But &s;urely, there is no Man of
Sen&s;e and Hone&s;ty but mu&s;t &s;ee and own,
whether he under&s;tands the Game or not,
that it is an evident Folly for any People, in|&s;tead
of pro&s;ecuting the old hone&s;t methods
of Indu&s;try and Frugality, to &s;it down to a
public Gaming Table, and play off their Mo|ny
one to another.</P>
<P>The more Methods there are in a State for
acquiring Riches without Indu&s;try or Merit,
the le&s;s there will be of either in that State.
This is as evident as the Ruin that attends it.
Be&s;ides, when Mony is &s;hifted from Hand to
Hand in &s;uch a blind fortuitous manner, that
&s;ome Men &s;hall from nothing in an in&s;tant
acquire va&s;t E&s;tates without the lea&s;t de&s;ert:
while others are as &s;uddenly &s;tript of plenti|ful
Fortunes, and left on the Pari&s;h by their
<PB N="6" REF="7">
own Avarice and Credulity: what can be
hoped for on the one hand, but abandoned
Luxury and Wantonne&s;s; or on the other, but
extream Madne&s;s and De&s;pair?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, all Projects for growing rich by
&s;udden and extraordinary methods, as they ope|rate
violently on the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men, and en|courage
them to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;low moderate
Gains that are to be made by an hone&s;t In|du&s;try,
mu&s;t be ruinous to the Public; and
even the Winners them&s;elves will at length be
involved in the Public Ruine.</P>
<P>It is an ea&s;y matter to contrive Projects for
the Encouragement of Indu&s;try; I wi&s;h it were
as ea&s;y to per&s;wade Men to put them in practice.
There is no Country in <HI>Europe</HI> where there is
&s;o much Charity collected for the Poor, and
none where it is &s;o ill managed. If the Poor
Tax was fixed at a medium in every Pari&s;h,
taken from a Calculation of the la&s;t ten Years,
and rai&s;ed for &s;even Years by Act of Parlia|ment,
that Sum (if the common E&s;timate be
not very wrong) frugally and prudently laid
out in Work-hou&s;es, would for ever free the
Nation from the care of providing for the
Poor, and at the &s;ame time con&s;iderably im|prove
our Manufactures. We might by the&s;e
means rid our Streets of Beggars; even the
Children, the Maimed, and the Blind might
be put in a way of doing &s;omething for their
livelyhood. As for the &s;mall number of tho&s;e,
who by Age or Infirmities, are utterly inca|pable
of all Employment, they might be main|tained
by the Labour of others. And the
<PB N="7" REF="8">
Public would receive no &s;mall advan|tage
from the Indu&s;try of tho&s;e, who
are now &s;o great a Burthen and Expence
to it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Tax, continued three Years longer,
might be very u&s;efully employed in making
high Roads, and rendering Rivers Navigable,
two things of &s;o much Profit and Ornament
to a Nation, that we &s;eem the only People in
<HI>Europe</HI> who have neglected them. So that in
the Space of ten Years the Public may be for
ever freed from a heavy Tax, Indu&s;try encou|raged,
Commerce facilitated, and the whole
Country improved. And all this only by a fru|gal
hone&s;t Management, without rai&s;ing one
Penny extraordinary.</P>
<P>The Number of People is both Means and
Motive to Indu&s;try, it &s;hould therefore be of
great u&s;e to encourage Propagation, by allow|ing
&s;ome Reward or Privilege to tho&s;e who
have a certain number of Children; And, on
the other hand, enacting that the Public &s;hall
inherit the unentailed E&s;tates of all who die un|married
of either Sex.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the immediate End propo&s;ed by the
foregoing methods, they furni&s;h Taxes upon
Pa&s;&s;engers, and dead Batchelors, which are in
no &s;ort grievous to the Subject, and may be
applied towards clearing the public Debt:
which, all Mankind agree, highly concerneth
the Nation in general, both Court and Coun|try.
<HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> indeed, mentions it as a piece of
Policy, that he borrowed Mony from his Offi|cers
<PB N="8" REF="9">
to be&s;tow it on the Soldiers, which fixed
both to his Intere&s;t. And tho' &s;omething like
this may pa&s;s for Skill at certain junctures in
Civil Government, yet if carried too far it will
prove a dangerous Experiment.</P>
<P>There is &s;till room for Invention or Im|provement
in mo&s;t Trades and Manufactures;
and it is probable, that Premiums given on
that account to ingenious Arti&s;ts would &s;oon
be repayed a hundred-fold to the Public. No
Colour is &s;o much worn in <HI>Italy, Spain,</HI> and
<HI>Portugal</HI> as Black: but our black Cloth is nei|ther
&s;o la&s;ting nor of &s;o good a Dye as the
<HI>Dutch;</HI> which is the rea&s;on of their engro&s;&s;ing
the Profits of that Trade. This is &s;o true, that
I have known <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants abroad wear
black Cloth of <HI>Holland</HI> them&s;elves, and &s;ell and
recommend it as better than that of their own
Country. It is commonly &s;aid the Water of
<HI>Leyden</HI> hath a peculiar property for colouring
Black. But it hath been al&s;o &s;aid and pa&s;&s;ed
current, that good Gla&s;&s;es could be made no
where but at <HI>Venice,</HI> and there only in the lit|tle
I&s;land of <HI>Morano:</HI> which was attributed to
&s;ome peculiar property in the Air. And we
may po&s;&s;ibly find other Opinions of that &s;ort
to be as groundle&s;s, &s;hould the Legi&s;lature think
it worth while to propo&s;e Premiums in the
foregoing or the like ca&s;es of general Benefit
to the Public. But I remember to have &s;een,
about &s;even Years ago, a Man pointed at in a
Coffee-hou&s;e, who (they &s;aid) had fir&s;t intro|duced
the right Scarlet Dye among us; by
which the Nation in general, as well as many
private Per&s;ons, have &s;ince been great Gainers;
<PB N="9" REF="10">
tho' he was him&s;elf a Beggar; who, if this be
true, de&s;erved an honourable Maintenance from
the Public.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;everal Manufactures which
we have from abroad, that may be carried on
to as great Perfection here as el&s;ewhere. If it
be con&s;idered that more fine Linnen is worn
in <HI>Great Britain</HI> than in any other Country of
<HI>Europe,</HI> it will be difficult to a&s;&s;ign a Rea&s;on
why Paper may not be made here as good,
and in the &s;ame quantity, as in <HI>Holland,</HI> or
<HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Genoa.</HI> This is a Manufacture of
great con&s;umption, and would &s;ave much to
the Public. The like may be &s;aid of Tape&s;try,
Lace, and other Manufactures, which if &s;et
on foot in cheap parts of the Country, would
employ many hands, and &s;ave Mony to the
Nation, as well as bring it from abroad. Pro|jects
for improving old Manufactures, or &s;et|ting
up new ones, &s;hould not be de&s;pi&s;ed in a
trading Country: But the making them pre|tences
for Stockjobbing hath been a fatal Im|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>As Indu&s;try dependeth upon Trade, and
this, as well as the public Security, upon our
Navigation, it concerneth the Legi&s;lature to
provide that the number of our Sailors do not
decrea&s;e. To which it would very much con|duce,
if a Law were made prohibiting the
Payment of Sailors in Foreign Ports: for it is
u&s;ual with tho&s;e on board Merchant-men, as
&s;oon as they &s;et foot a&s;hore to receive their
Pay, which is &s;oon &s;pent in riotous living.
And when they have emptied their Pockets,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the temptation of a Pi&s;tole pre&s;ent Mony ne|ver
faileth to draw them into any Foreign Ser|vice.
To this (if I may credit the Informati|on
I have had from &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factors abroad)
it is chiefly owing, that the <HI>Venetians, Spani|ards,</HI>
and others, have &s;o many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> on board
their Ships. Some Merchants indeed and Ma|&s;ters
of Ve&s;&s;els may make a Profit in defraud|ing
tho&s;e poor Wretches, when they pay
them in &s;trange Coin (which I have been a&s;|&s;ured
often amounts to twelve-pence in the
Crown) as well as in ridding them&s;elves of
the Charge of keeping them when they &s;ell
their Ships, or &s;tay long in Port. But the
Public lo&s;eth both the Mony and the Men,
who, if their Arrears were to be cleared at
home, would be &s;ure to return, and &s;pend
them in their own Country. It is a &s;hame this
abu&s;e &s;hould not be remedied.</P>
<P>FRUGALITY of Manners is the Nou|ri&s;hment
and Strength of Bodies Politic. It
is that by which they grow and &s;ub&s;i&s;t, till
they are corrupted by Luxury, the natural
cau&s;e of their decay and ruine. Of this we
have Examples in the <HI>Per&s;ians, Lacedaemonians</HI>
and <HI>Romans:</HI> not to mention many later Go|vernments
which have &s;prung up, continued a
while, and then peri&s;hed by the &s;ame natural
Cau&s;es. But the&s;e are it &s;eems of no u&s;e to us:
and, in &s;pight of them, we are in a fair way of
becoming our &s;elves another u&s;ele&s;s Example to
future Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
Men are apt to mea&s;ure national Pro&s;perity
by Riches: it would be righter to mea&s;ure it
by the U&s;e that is made of them. Where they
promote an hone&s;t Commerce among Men,
and are Motives to Indu&s;try and Virtue, they
are without doubt of great advantage. But
where they are made (as too often happens) an
In&s;trument to Luxury, they enervate and di|&s;pirit
the brave&s;t People. So ju&s;t is that Re|mark
of <HI>Machiavel</HI>'s, that there is no truth
in the common Saying, <HI>Mony is the Nerves of
War.</HI> And tho' we may &s;ub&s;i&s;t tolerably for
a time among corrupt Neighbours, yet if ever
we have to do with a hardy, temperate, reli|gious
&s;ort of Men, we &s;hall find, to our co&s;t,
that all our Riches are but a poor exchange
for that Simplicity of Manners which we de|&s;pi&s;e
in our Ance&s;tors. This &s;ole advantage
hath been the main &s;upport of all tho&s;e Re|publics
that have made a figure in the World:
and perhaps it might be no ill Policy in a King|dom
to form it &s;elf upon the Manners of a Re|public.</P>
<P>Simplicity of Manners may be more ea&s;ily
pre&s;erved in a Republic than a Monarchy; but,
if once lo&s;t, may be &s;ooner recovered in a Monar|chy,
the Example of a Court being of great Effi|cacy,
either to reform or corrupt a People.
That alone were &s;ufficient to di&s;countenance
the wearing of Gold or Silver, either on Cloaths
or Equipages. And if the &s;ame were prohibi|ted
by Law, the &s;aving &s;o much Bullion would
be the &s;malle&s;t Benefit of &s;uch an In&s;titution;
<PB N="12" REF="13">
there being nothing more apt to deba&s;e the
Virtue and good Sen&s;e of our Gentry of both
Sexes, than that trifling vanity of Apparel,
which we have learned from <HI>France,</HI> and which
hath had &s;uch vi&s;ible ill Con&s;equences on the Ge|nius
of that People. Wi&s;er Nations have made
it their Care to &s;hut out this folly by &s;evere
Laws and Penalties. And its &s;preading among
us can forebode no good, if there be any truth
in the Ob&s;ervation of one of the Ancients, that
<HI>the direct way to ruine a Man is to dre&s;s him
up in fine Cloaths.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be denied that Luxury of Dre&s;s
giveth a light Behaviour to our Women, which
may pa&s;s for a &s;mall Offence, becau&s;e it is a
common one, but is, in truth, the &s;ource of great
Corruptions. For this very Offence the Prophet
<HI>I&s;aiah</HI> denounced a &s;evere Judgment again&s;t the
Ladies of his time. I &s;hall give the Pa&s;&s;age at
length. &startq;Moreover the Lord &s;aith, becau&s;e
the Daughters of <HI>Zion</HI> are haughty and walk
with &s;tretched forth Necks, walking and
mincing as they go, and making a tinkling
with their Feet. Therefore the Lord will
&s;mite with a &s;cab the Crown of the Head
of the Daughters of <HI>Zion,</HI> and the Lord will
di&s;cover their &s;ecret parts. In that Day the
Lord will take away the bravery of their
tinkling Ornaments about their Feet, and
their cauls and their round tires like the
Moon; the chains, and the bracelets, and
the mufflers; the bonnets and the ornaments
of the Legs, and the head-bands, and the
tablets and the ear-rings. The rings and
<PB N="13" REF="14">
no&s;e-jewels, the changeable Suits of Appa|rel,
and the mantles, and the wimples, and
the cri&s;ping pins. The gla&s;&s;es and the fine
linnen, and the hoods and the vails. And
it &s;hall come to pa&s;s that in&s;tead of &s;weet
&s;mell there &s;hall be a &s;tink: and in&s;tead of
a girdle a rent; and in&s;tead of well-&s;et
hair, baldne&s;s; and in&s;tead of a &s;tomacher
a girding of &s;ackcloth: and burning in&s;tead
of Beauty.&endq; The Scab, the Stench, and the
Burning are terrible pe&s;tilential Symptoms,
and our Ladies would do well to con&s;ider,
they may chance to re&s;emble tho&s;e of <HI>Zion</HI>
in their Puni&s;hment as well as their Offence.</P>
<P>But Dre&s;s is not the only thing to be re|formed.
Sumptuary Laws are u&s;eful in ma|ny
other Points. In former times the natu|ral
Plainne&s;s and good Sen&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
made them le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. But ever &s;ince the
luxurious Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second,
we have been doing Violence to our Natures,
and are by this time &s;o much altered for the
wor&s;e, that it is to be feared, the very &s;ame Di&s;|po&s;itions
that make them nece&s;&s;ary, will for ever
hinder their being Enacted or put in Execution.</P>
<P>A private Family in difficult Circum&s;tances,
all Men agree, ought to melt down their
Plate, walk on foot, retrench the number of
their Servants, wear neither Jewels nor rich
Cloaths, and deny them&s;elves expen&s;ive Diver|&s;ions;
and why not the Public? Had any
thing like this been done, our Taxes had been
le&s;s, or, which is the &s;ame thing, we &s;hou'd
have felt them le&s;s. But it is very remarkable,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
that Luxury was never at &s;o great a height,
nor &s;pread &s;o generally through the Nation, as
during the Expence of the late Wars and the
heavy Debt that &s;till lieth upon us.</P>
<P>This Vice draweth after it a train of E|vils
which cruelly infe&s;t the Public: Faction,
Ambition, Envy, Avarice, and that of the
wor&s;t kind, being much more hurtful in its
con&s;equences, tho' not &s;o infamous as Penury.
It was the great art of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu,</HI> by
encouraging Luxury and Expence to impove|ri&s;h
the <HI>French</HI> Nobility, and render them altoge|ther
dependent on the Crown, which hath been
&s;ince very &s;ucce&s;sfully effected. The&s;e and
many more Con&s;iderations &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity
there is for Sumptuary Laws. Nor can any
thing be &s;aid again&s;t them in this I&s;land, which
might not with equal force be objected in o|ther
Countries, which have neverthele&s;s
judged the public benefit of &s;uch In&s;tituti|ons,
to be of far greater importance than the
&s;hort &s;ufferings of a few who &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the
Luxury of others.</P>
<P>It is evident, that old Taxes may be better
born, as well as new ones rai&s;ed by Sumptu|ary
Laws judiciou&s;ly framed, not to damage
our Trade but retrench our Luxury. It is
evident, that for want of the&s;e, Luxury
(which, like other fa&s;hions, never faileth to de&s;|cend)
hath infected all ranks of People, and
that this enableth the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> to
under&s;ell us, to the great prejudice of our
Traffic. We cannot but know that in our
pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, it &s;hould be our Care,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
as it is our Intere&s;t, to make Poverty tolera|ble.
In fine, we have the Experience of ma|ny
Ages to convince us, that a corrupt
luxurious People mu&s;t of them&s;elves fall into
Slavery, altho' no Attempt be made upon
them. The&s;e and the like obvious Reflexions
&s;hould, one would think, have forced any
People in their Sen&s;es upon frugal mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But we are doomed to be undone. Neither
the plain Rea&s;on of the thing, nor the Ex|perience
of pa&s;&s;ed Ages, nor the Examples
we have before our Eyes, can re&s;train us from
imitating, not to &s;ay &s;urpa&s;&s;ing, the mo&s;t cor|rupt
and ruined People, in tho&s;e very points
of Luxury that ruined them. Our Gaming,
our Opera's, our Ma&s;querades, are, in &s;pight
of our Debts and Poverty, become the Won|der
of our Neighbours. If there be any
Man &s;o void of all Thought and common
Sen&s;e, as not to &s;ee where this mu&s;t end,
let him but compare what <HI>Venice</HI> was at
the League of <HI>Cambray,</HI> with what it is at
pre&s;ent, and he will be convinced, how truly
tho&s;e fa&s;hionable Pa&s;times are calculated to
depre&s;s and ruine a Nation.</P>
<P>But neither <HI>Venice</HI> nor <HI>Paris,</HI> nor any other
Town in any part of the World, ever knew
&s;uch an expen&s;ive ruinous Folly as our Ma&s;|querade.
This alone is &s;ufficient to inflame
and &s;atisfy the &s;everal Appetites for Gaming,
Dre&s;&s;ing, Intriguing, luxurious Eating and
Drinking. It is a mo&s;t skilful Abridgment,
the very Quinte&s;&s;ence, the Ab&s;tract, of $word$ tho&s;e
&s;en&s;ele&s;s Vanities, that have ever been the
<PB N="16" REF="17">
ruine of Fools and dete&s;tation of Wi&s;e Men.
And all this under the notion of an elegant
Entertainment hath been admitted among us:
tho' it be in truth a Contagion of the wor&s;t
kind. The Plague, dreadful as it is, is an E|vil
of &s;hort duration. Cities have often re|covered
and flourished after it. But when
was it known that a People broken and cor|rupted
by Luxury recovered them&s;elves? Not
to &s;ay, that general Corruption of Manners
never faileth to draw after it &s;ome heavy
Judgment of War, Famine or Pe&s;tilence. Of
this we have a fre&s;h in&s;tance in one of the
mo&s;t debauched Towns of <HI>Europe.</HI> And no
body knows how &s;oon it may be our own
Ca&s;e. This elegant Entertainment is indeed
&s;u&s;pended for the pre&s;ent, but there remains
&s;o &s;trong a Propen&s;ion towards it, that if the
Wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lature do not interpo&s;e,
it will &s;oon return with the additional temp|tation
of having been forbid for a time. It
were &s;tupid and barbarous to declaim again&s;t
keeping up the Spirit of the People by pro|per
Diver&s;ions. But then they &s;hould be pro|per,
&s;uch as poli&s;h and improve their Minds
or encrea&s;e the Strength and Activity of their
Bodies: none of which Ends are an&s;wered by
the Ma&s;querade, no more than by tho&s;e
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Follies, which, to our
&s;hame, are imported and encouraged at a time,
when the Nation ought to be too grave for
&s;uch Trifles.</P>
<P>It is not to be believed, what Influence
public Diver&s;ions have on the Spirit and Man|ners
of a People. The <HI>Greeks</HI> wi&s;ely &s;aw
<PB N="17" REF="18">
this, and made a very &s;erious affair of their
Public Sports. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, it will
perhaps &s;eem worthy the care of our Legi&s;la|ture,
to regulate the Public Diver&s;ions, by an
ab&s;olute Prohibition of tho&s;e which have a
direct tendency to corrupt our Morals, as well
as by a Reformation of the Drama: which,
when rightly managed, is &s;uch a noble enter|tainment,
and gave tho&s;e fine Le&s;&s;ons of Mo|rality
and good Sen&s;e to the <HI>Athenians</HI> of
old, and to our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Gentry about a Cen|tury
ago: but for the&s;e la&s;t &s;ixty Years, hath
entertained us, for the mo&s;t part, with &s;uch
poor &s;orry things as &s;poil, in&s;tead of improv|ing,
the Ta&s;te and Manners of the Audience.
Tho&s;e who are attentive to &s;uch propo&s;itions
only, as may fill their Pockets, will proba|bly
&s;light the&s;e things as Trifles below the
care of the Legi&s;lature. But I am &s;ure, all
Hone&s;t Thinking Men mu&s;t lament to &s;ee
their Country run headlong into all tho&s;e
Luxurious Follies, which, it is evident, have
been fatal to other Nations, and will un|doubtedly
prove fatal to us al&s;o, if a timely
&s;top be not put to them.</P>
<P>PUBLIC SPIRIT, that Glorious
Principle of all that is great and good, is &s;o
far from being cheri&s;hed or encouraged,
that it is become ridiculous in this en|lightened
Age, which is taught to laugh at
every thing that is &s;erious as well as &s;acred.
The &s;ame Athei&s;tical narrow Spirit, centring
all our Cares upon private Intere&s;t, and con|tracting
all our Hopes within the Enjoyment
<PB N="18" REF="19">
of this pre&s;ent Life, equally produceth a neg|lect
of what we owe to God and our Coun|try.
<HI>Tully</HI> hath long &s;ince ob&s;erved, that it
is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e, who have no belief of
the Immortality of the Soul or a future State
of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, to Sacrifice
their particular Intere&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions to the
Public Good, or have a generous Concern
for Po&s;terity: And our own Experience con|firmeth
the truth of this Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In order therefore to recover a Sen&s;e of
Public Spirit, it is to be wi&s;hed that Men
were fir&s;t affected with a true Sen&s;e of Reli|gion:
<HI>Pro aris &amp; focis</HI> having ever been the
great Motive to Courage and Per&s;everance in
a Public Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It wou'd likewi&s;e be a very u&s;eful Policy,
and warranted by the example of the wi&s;e&s;t
Governments, to make the natural Love of
Fame and Reputation &s;ub&s;ervient to promot|ing
that noble Principle. Triumphal Arches,
Columns, Statues, In&s;criptions, and the like
Monuments of Public Services, have in for|mer
times been found great Incentives to
Virtue and Magnanimity, and would proba|bly
have the &s;ame effects on <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> which
they have had on <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> And,
perhaps, a Pillar of Infamy would be found
a proper and exemplary Puni&s;hment in ca&s;es
of &s;ignal Public Villany, where the lo&s;s of
Fortune, Liberty or Life are not proportioned
to the Crime: or where the Skill of the Of|fender,
or the Nature of his Offence, may
skreen him from the Letter of the Law.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
Several of the&s;e are to be &s;een at <HI>Genoa,
Milan,</HI> and other Towns of <HI>Italy,</HI> where it
is the Cu&s;tom to demoli&s;h the Hou&s;e of a Ci|tizen,
who hath con&s;pired the Ruin of his
Country, or been guilty of any enormous
Crime towards the Public, and in place there|of
to erect a Monument of the Crime and
Criminal de&s;cribed in the blacke&s;t manner.
We have nothing of this &s;ort, that I know,
but that which is commonly called the Monu|ment:
which in the la&s;t Age was erected for
a trifle, in all its circum&s;tances and con&s;e|quences,
if compared with the modern un|exampled
attempt of Men ea&s;y in their For|tunes,
and unprovoked by Hard&s;hips of any
&s;ort in cool Blood and with open Eyes to
ruine their Native Country. This foul fact
will never be forgotten, and it were to be
wi&s;hed that with it the Public Dete&s;tation
thereof may be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity,
which would in &s;ome mea&s;ure vindicate the
Honour of the pre&s;ent and be an u&s;eful Le&s;|&s;on
to future Ages.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e noble Arts of Architecture, Sculp|ture,
and Painting do not only adorn the
Public, but have al&s;o an influence on the
Minds and Manners of Men, filling them
with great Ideas, and &s;piriting them up to
an Emulation of worthy Actions. For this
Cau&s;e they were cultivated and encouraged
by the <HI>Greek</HI> Cities, who vied with each o|ther
in building and adorning their Temples,
Theaters, Portico's and the like Public
Works, at the &s;ame time that they di&s;cou|raged
<PB N="20" REF="21">
private Luxury: the very rever&s;e of our
Conduct.</P>
<P>To propo&s;e the building a Parliament
Hou&s;e, Courts of Ju&s;tice, Royal Palace, and
other Public Edifices &s;uitable to the Dignity
of the Nation, and adorning them with
Paintings and Statues, which may tran&s;mit
memorable Things and Per&s;ons to Po&s;terity,
would probably be laughed at as a vain Affair,
of great Expence and little u&s;e to the Public;
and it mu&s;t be owned, we have reduced our
&s;elves to &s;uch Straits, that any Propo&s;ition of
Expence &s;uiteth ill with our pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances.
But how improper &s;oever this Pro|po&s;al
may be for the Times, yet it comes &s;o
properly into a Di&s;cour&s;e of Public Spirit,
that I could not but &s;ay &s;omething of it.
And at another time it will not &s;eem un|rea&s;onable,
if we con&s;ider that it is no more
than the wi&s;e&s;t Nations have done before us,
that it would &s;pirit up new Arts, employ
many Hands, keep the Mony circulating at
home, and la&s;tly, that it would be a notable
in&s;tance of Public Spirit, as well as a Motive
to it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame noble Principle may be al&s;o en|couraged,
by erecting an Academy of inge|nious
Men who&s;e Employment it &s;hould be
to compile the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to
make Di&s;cour&s;es proper to in&s;pire Men with a
Zeal for the Public, and celebrate the Memo|ry
of tho&s;e who have been Ornaments to the
Nation, or done it eminent Service. Not to
mention, that this would improve our Lan|guage,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
and amu&s;e &s;ome bu&s;y Spirits of the
Age: which, perhaps, would be no ill Po|licy.</P>
<P>This is not without Example: for, to &s;ay
nothing of the <HI>French</HI> Academy which is
pro&s;tituted to meaner Purpo&s;es, it hath been
the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Senate, to ap|point
one of their Order to continue the
Hi&s;tory of the Republic. This was introdu|ced
in the flouri&s;hing State of that People,
and is &s;till in force. We fall &s;hort of other
Nations in the number of good Hi&s;torians,
tho' no Nation in Chri&s;tendom hath produced
greater Events, or more worthy to be record|ed.
The <HI>Athenian</HI> Senate appointed Orators
to commemorate annually tho&s;e who died in
defence of their Country, which Solemnity
was performed at the Monuments erected in
honour of them by the Public: and the Pa|negyrics
compo&s;ed by <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> and <HI>Pericles,</HI>
as well as many Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Tully,</HI> inform
us with what plea&s;ure the ancient Orators
u&s;ed to expatiate in Prai&s;e of their Coun|try.</P>
<P>Concord and Union among our &s;elves is ra|ther
to be hoped for, as an Effect of public
Spirit, than propo&s;ed as a Means to promote
it. Candid, generous Men, who are true
Lovers of their Country, can never be Ene|mies
to one half of their Countrymen, or car|ry
their Re&s;entments &s;o far as to ruine the
Public for the &s;ake of a Party. Now I have
fallen upon the mention of our Parties, I &s;hall
beg leave to in&s;ert a Remark or two, for the
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Service both of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> without en|tering
into their re&s;pective Merits. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It
is impo&s;&s;ible for either Party to ruine the o|ther,
without involving Them&s;elves and their
Po&s;terity in the &s;ame Ruine. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It is
very fea&s;ible for either Party to get the bet|ter
of the other, if they could fir&s;t get the
better of them&s;elves; and in&s;tead of indulging
the little womani&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions of Ob&s;tinacy,
Re&s;entment, and Revenge, &s;teadily promote
the true Intere&s;t of their Country, in tho&s;e
great clear Points of Piety, Indu&s;try, Sobrie|ty
of Manners, and an hone&s;t Regard for Po|&s;terity;
which, all Men of Sen&s;e agree, are
e&s;&s;ential to public Happine&s;s. There would
be &s;omething &s;o great and good in this Con|duct,
as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily overbear all Ca|lumny
and Oppo&s;ition. But that Men &s;hould
act rea&s;onably is rather to be wi&s;hed than
hoped.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that to talk of public
Spirit, and the Means of retrieving it, mu&s;t
to narrow &s;ordid Minds be matter of Je&s;t and
Ridicule, how conformable &s;oever it be to
right Rea&s;on and the Maxims of Antiquity.
Tho' one would think, the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h Men
might &s;ee it was their Intere&s;t to encourage
a Spirit in others by which they, to be
&s;ure, mu&s;t be Gainers. Yet, &s;uch is the Cor|ruption
and Folly of the pre&s;ent Age, that a
public Spirit is treated like Ignorance of the
World, and want of Sen&s;e; and all the Re|&s;pect
is paid to cunning Men, who bend
and wre&s;t the Public Intere&s;t to their own
private Ends, that in other times hath been
<PB N="23" REF="24">
thought due to tho&s;e who were generous e|nough
to &s;acrifice their private Intere&s;t to
that of their Country.</P>
<P>Such Practices and &s;uch Maxims as the&s;e
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ruine a State. But if the
contrary &s;hould prevail, we may hope to &s;ee
Men in Power prefer the public Wealth and
Security to their own, and Men of Money
make free Gifts or lend it without Intere&s;t
to their Country. This, how &s;trange and
incredible &s;oever it may &s;eem to us, hath
been often done in other States. And the
natural <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Temper con&s;idered, together
with the force of Example, no one can tell
how far a Propo&s;al for a free Gift may go
among the monied Men, when &s;et on Foot
by the Legi&s;lature, and encouraged by the
Example of two or three Men of Figure,
who have the Spirit to do a generous thing,
and the Under&s;tanding to &s;ee it is every pri|vate
Man's Intere&s;t to &s;upport that of the
Public.</P>
<P>If they who have their Fortunes in Money
&s;hould make a voluntary Gift, the Public
would be ea&s;ed, and at the &s;ame time main|tain
it's Credit. Nor is a generous Love of
their Country the only Motive that &s;hould
induce them to this. Common Equity re|quireth
that all Subjects &s;hould equally &s;hare
the public Burthen. And common Sen&s;e
&s;heweth, that tho&s;e who are foremo&s;t in the
Danger &s;hould not be the mo&s;t backward in
contributing to prevent it</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
Before I leave this Subject, I cannot but
take notice of that mo&s;t infamous Practice of
Bribery, than which nothing can be more
oppo&s;ite to Public Spirit. Since every one
who takes a Bribe, plainly owns that he pre|fers
his private Intere&s;t to that of his Country.
This Corruption is become a national Crime,
having infected the lowe&s;t as well as the highe&s;t
among us, and is &s;o general and notorious,
that, as it cannot be matched in former Ages,
&s;o it is to be hoped it will not be imitated by
Po&s;terity. This calls to mind another natio|nal
Guilt which we po&s;&s;e&s;s in a very eminent
degree: There being no Nation under the
Sun where &s;olemn Perjury is &s;o common, or
where there are &s;uch Temptations to it. The
making Men &s;wear &s;o often in their own
Ca&s;es, and where they have an Intere&s;t to
conceal the Truth, hath gradually worn off
that awful Re&s;pect which was once thought
due to an Appeal to Almighty God: In&s;o|much
that Men now-a-days break their Fa&s;t
and a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Oath with the &s;ame
Peace of Mind. It is a Policy peculiar to us,
the obliging Men to perjure or betray them|&s;elves,
and hath had no one good Effect, but
many very ill Ones. Sure I am, that o|ther
Nations, without the hundredth part of
our Swearing, contrive to do their Bu&s;ine&s;s, at
lea&s;t as well as we do. And perhaps our Le|gi&s;lature
will think it proper to follow their
Example. For whatever Mea&s;ures are taken,
&s;o long as we lie under &s;uch a load of Guilt,
as National Perjury and National Bribery, it
is impo&s;&s;ible we can pro&s;per.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
This poor Nation hath &s;orely &s;marted of
late; and to ea&s;e the pre&s;ent Smart, a &s;udden
Remedy (as is natural in &s;uch ca&s;es) hath been
thought of. But we mu&s;t beware not to mi|&s;take
an Anodyne for a Cure. Where the Vi|tals
are touched, and the whole ma&s;s of Hu|mours
vitiated, it is not enough to ea&s;e the
part pained, we mu&s;t look further and apply
general Correctives; otherwi&s;e the ill humour
may &s;oon &s;hew it &s;elf in &s;ome other part.</P>
<P>The <HI>South-Sea</HI> Affair, how &s;en&s;ible &s;oever,
is not the original Evil or the great Source
of our Misfortunes; it is but the natural Effect
of tho&s;e Principles which for many Years have
been propagated with great Indu&s;try. And as
a &s;harp Di&s;temper by reclaiming a Man from
Intemperance may prolong his Life, &s;o it is
not impo&s;&s;ible but this public Calamity that
lieth &s;o heavy on the Nation may prevent its
Ruine: It would certainly prove the greate&s;t of
Ble&s;&s;ings if it &s;hould make all hone&s;t Men of
one Party; If it &s;hould put Religion and Vir|tue
in countenance, re&s;tore a &s;en&s;e of Public
Spirit, and convince Men it is a dangerous fol|ly
to pur&s;ue private Aims in oppo&s;ition to the
Good of their Country; If it &s;hould turn our
Thoughts from Cou&s;enage and Stock-jobbing
to Indu&s;try and frugal Methods of Life; In
fine, if it &s;hould revive and inflame that native
spark of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Worth and Honour which hath
too long lain &s;mothered and oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>With this view I have, among &s;o many
Projects for remedying the ill &s;tate of our Af|fairs
in a particular In&s;tance, ventured to pub|li&s;h
<PB N="26" REF="27">
the foregoing general hints, which as they
have been thrown together from a Zeal for
the public Good, &s;o I heartily wi&s;h they may
be regarded neither more nor le&s;s than as they
are fitted to promote that end.</P>
<P>Tho' it mu&s;t be owned that little can be
hoped if we con&s;ider the corrupt degenerate
Age we live in. I know it is an old folly to
make peevi&s;h complaints of the Times, and
charge the common failures of human Nature
on a particular Age. One may neverthele&s;s
venture to affirm, that the pre&s;ent hath brought
forth new and portentous Villanies, not to be
parallel'd in our own or any other Hi&s;tory.
We have been long preparing for &s;ome great
Cata&s;trophe. Vice and Villainy have by de|grees
grown reputable among us. Our Infi|dels
have pa&s;&s;ed for fine Gentlemen, and our
venal Traytors for Men of Sen&s;e who knew
the World. We have made a je&s;t of Public
Spirit, and cancelled all re&s;pect for whatever
our Laws and Religion repute Sacred. The old
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mode&s;ty is quite worn off, and in&s;tead
of blu&s;hing for our Crimes, we are a&s;hamed
only of Piety and Virtue. In &s;hort, other Na|tions
have been wicked, but we are the fir&s;t
who have been wicked upon Principle.</P>
<P>The truth is, our Symptoms are &s;o bad that
notwith&s;tanding all the care and vigilance of
the Legi&s;lature, it is to be feared the final Pe|riod
of our State approaches. Strong Con&s;ti|tutions,
whether politic or natural, do not feel
light di&s;orders. But, when they are &s;en&s;ibly
affected, the Di&s;temper is for the mo&s;t part
<PB N="27" REF="28">
violent and of an ill Progno&s;tic. Free Govern|ments
like our own were planted by the <HI>Goths</HI>
in mo&s;t parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> And tho' we all know
what they are come to, yet we &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed
rather to follow their Example, than to pro|fit
by it.</P>
<P>Whether it be in the order of things, that
Civil States &s;hould have, like natural Products,
their &s;everal Periods of Growth, Perfection,
and Decay: or whether it be an Effect, as
&s;eemeth more probable, of humane Folly, that as
Indu&s;try produceth Wealth, &s;o Wealth &s;hould
produce Vice, and Vice Ruine.</P>
<P>God grant the time be not near, when Po|&s;terity
&s;hall &s;ay, &startq;This I&s;land was once inha|bited'
by a Religious, Brave, Sincere People,
of plain uncorrupt Manners, re&s;pecting in|bred
Worth rather than Titles and Appea|rances,
A&s;&s;erters of Liberty, Lovers of their
Country, jealous of their own Rights, and
unwilling to infringe the Rights of others;
Improvers of Learning and u&s;eful Arts, E|nemies
to Luxury, tender of other Mens
Lives, and prodigal of their own; inferior in
nothing to the old <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans,</HI> and &s;u|perior
to each of tho&s;e People in the Per|fections
of the other. Such were our An|ce&s;tors
during their Ri&s;e and Greatne&s;s; but
they degenerated, grew &s;ervile Flatterers of
Men in Power, adopted <HI>Epicurean</HI> Notions,
became venal, corrupt, injurious, which drew
upon them the Hatred of God and Man, and
occa&s;ioned their final Ruine.&endq;</P>
