<HEAD>The WOODPECKERS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Greek the Woodpecker was called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, a tree, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, an oak, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, to hollow out by blows; al&s;o <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, wood, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, to cut, and in He&s;ychius <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Ari&s;tophanes calls it, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, an ax, alluding to the form and office of its bill: in modern Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Pliny terms it <HI>Picus Arborarius.</HI> The Hebrew name is <HI>Anapha,</HI> and according to others, <HI>Bleschiat.</HI> In Italian <HI>Pico,</HI> or <HI>Picchio.</HI> In German <HI>Specht.</HI> In Flemi&s;h <HI>Spicht.</HI> In Spani&s;h <HI>Beguebo.</HI> In P&oacute;li&s;h <HI>Dzieziol.</HI> In Turki&s;h <HI>Saegarieck.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Les Pics.</HI> Buff. <HI>Pici.</HI> Linnaeus, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE animals alone, which live upon the fruits of the earth, join in &s;ociety. Nature entertains them with a perpetual banquet, and abundance begets tho&s;e gentle peaceful di&s;po&s;itions which are fitted for &s;ocial intercour&s;e. Other animals are con|&s;tantly engaged in the pur&s;uit of prey;
<PB N="2" REF="15">
urged by want, re&s;trained by apprehen&s;ions of danger, they depend for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on the vigour of their own exertions: they have &s;carce time to &s;atisfy their immediate de&s;ires, and no lei&s;ure to cheri&s;h the bene|volent affections. Such is the &s;olitary con|dition of all the carnivorous birds, except a few cowardly tribes which prowl on putrid carrion, and rather combine like robbers, than unite as friends.</P>
<P>And of all the birds which earn their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by &s;poil, none leads a life &s;o laborious and &s;o painful as the Woodpecker. Nature has condemned it to ince&s;&s;ant toil and &s;lavery. While others freely employ their courage or addre&s;s, and either &s;hoot on rapid wing, or lurk in clo&s;e ambu&s;h; the Woodpecker is con&s;trained to drag out an in&s;ipid exi&s;tence in boring the bark and hard fibres of trees, to extract its humble prey. Nece&s;&s;ity never &s;uffers any inter|mi&s;&s;ion of its labours; never grants an interval of &s;ound repo&s;e: often during the night it &s;leeps in the &s;ame painful po&s;ture as in the fatigues of the day. It never &s;hares the cheerful &s;ports of the other in|habitants of the air: it joins not their vocal concerts, and its wild cries, and &s;addening tones, while they di&s;turb the &s;ilence of the fore&s;t, expre&s;s con&s;traint and effort. Its
<PB N="3" REF="16">
movements are quick; its ge&s;tures, full of inquietude; its looks, coar&s;e and vulgar; it &s;huns all &s;ociety, even that of its own kind; and when it is prompted by lu&s;t to &s;eek a companion, its appetite is not &s;oft|ened by delicacy of feeling.</P>
<P>Such is the narrow and gro&s;s in&s;tinct &s;uited to a mean and a gloomy life. The organs with which the Woodpecker is fur|ni&s;hed, corre&s;pond to its de&s;tination.

Its bill is edged, &s;traight, wedge|&s;haped, &s;quare at the ba&s;e, channelled long|wi&s;e, flat, and cut vertical at its tip like a chi&s;el: this is the in&s;trument with which it pierces the bark, and bores into the wood, to extract the in&s;ects, or their eggs. The &s;ub&s;tance of the bill is hard and &s;olid <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot">Belon and Ari&s;totle.</NOTE>, and ri&s;es out of the cranium, which is very thick. Powerful mu&s;cles act upon its &s;hort neck, and direct its ince&s;&s;ant blows, which
<PB N="4" REF="17">
&s;ometimes penetrate even to the pith of the wood. It darts its long tongue, which is tapered and rounded like an earth-worm, and tipt with a hard bony point, like a needle. Its tail con&s;i&s;ts of ten &s;tiff quills, bent inwards, truncated at the ends, be&s;et with hard bri&s;tles; and this often &s;erves it as a re&s;t, while employed in a con&s;trained, and often inverted, po&s;ture. It breeds in the cavities which it has in part formed it&s;elf; the progeny i&s;&s;ue from the heart of the tree, and, though furni&s;hed with wings, they are almo&s;t confined to the verge of its circumference, and condemned to tread the dull round of life.</P>
<P>The genus of the Woodpecker contains a great number of &s;pecies, which differ in &s;ize and in colours.

Yet nature has placed Woodpeckers in all countries where &s;he has planted trees, and in greater plenty in the warm climates. There are only twelve &s;pecies in Europe, and in the arctic regions; but we may reckon twenty-&s;even from the hot countries of America, of Africa, and of A&s;ia. And thus, though

The Green-Woodpecker is &s;een oftener on the ground <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE> than the other Woodpeck|ers, particularly near ant-hills, where we may be &s;ure to find it, and even to catch it by means of a noo&s;e. It in&s;erts its long tongue into the narrow hole, through which the ants commonly i&s;&s;ue, and as &s;oon as it feels the tip covered with the&s;e in&s;ects, it withdraws, and &s;wallows them. But when the&s;e little republicans are inactive and &s;till, or torpid with cold, the bird a&s;&s;aults their citadel, and, employing both feet and bill, &s;oon makes a breach, and at ea&s;e de|vours them, and their chry&s;alids.</P>
<P>At other times it creeps again&s;t the trees, which it &s;trikes with ince&s;&s;ant blows; and, labouring with the mo&s;t &s;trenuous activity, it often &s;trips them of all their bark. The &s;trokes of its bill are audible at a di&s;tance, and may be di&s;tinctly counted. In other re&s;pects it is indolent, and will &s;uffer a per&s;on to approach near it, and will endea|vour only to conceal it&s;elf from the &s;port&s;|man, by warping round the branch, and clinging on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. It has been &s;aid, that, after a few knocks, it removes to another part of the tree to ob&s;erve if it has pierced it; but its view rather to
<PB N="8" REF="22">
gather on the bark the in&s;ects which it has rou&s;ed and put in motion: and, what is more certain, it judges from the &s;ound of the blow in what cranies the worms are lodged, or where there is a proper cavity for its own accommodation.</P>
<P>It u&s;ually forms its ne&s;t in the heart of &s;ome worm-eaten tree, at the height of fif|teen or twenty feet above the ground, and oftene&s;t in the &s;ofter kinds of wood, the a&s;pin, or the willow, rather than the oak. Both male and female, by turns, labour ince&s;&s;antly in boring the fre&s;h part of the timber, until they penetrate to the rotten center. Then they fa&s;hion and enlarge the cavity, and throw out with their feet the chips and wood du&s;t: &s;ometimes they make the hole &s;o deep and crooked, that the light cannot enter, and they rear their young in the dark. They commonly lay five eggs, which are greeni&s;h, with &s;mall black &s;pots. The infant brood begin to creep before they are able to fly. The parents &s;eldom leave them; they roo&s;t very early, and re|po&s;e in their holes till day.</P>
<P>Some naturali&s;ts have thought the Green-Woodpecker was the rain-bird of the an|cients, <HI>pluviae avis,</HI> becau&s;e it is generally believed to foretell rain by an unu&s;ual cry, which is drawling and plaintive, <HI>pheu, pheu,</HI>

<P>Albertus and Scaliger were a&s;&s;ured that the Green Woodpecker could learn to &s;peak, and that it &s;ometimes pronounces words di&s;tinctly: Willughby ju&s;tly di&s;believes it. The &s;tructure of its tongue, which is long and worm-&s;haped, appears entirely unfit to articulate &s;ounds; and its wild intract|able nature cannot &s;ubmit to education: for how could a bird be trained in the dome&s;tic &s;tate, which lives only upon the in&s;ects that lurk under the bark of trees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Vi&s;count de Querhoent a&s;&s;ures us, however, that he kept them at lea&s;t for &s;ome time; but he confirms us in the idea of their untractable di&s;po&s;ition.

According to Fri&s;ch, the males alone have red on the head; and Klein makes the &s;ame a&s;&s;ertion.

According to the ob&s;er|vation of Linnaeus, this red varies, and appears mixed &s;ometimes with black &s;pots, and &s;ometimes with grey ones, and, in a few in&s;tances, without any &s;pots at all. Some individuals, which are probably old males, a&s;&s;ume a red tint on the two black mu&s;tachoes which ari&s;e from the corners of the bill, and their colours are in general more vivid.</P>
<P>Fri&s;ch relates, that in Germany dur|ing winter, the Green Woodpeckers plun|der bee-hives.

<P>When we di&s;&s;ect them, we commonly find the crop filled with ants. They have no <HI>coecum,</HI> which is wanting equally in all birds of this kind; but in&s;tead of it there

is a dilatation of the inte&s;tine. The gall|bladder is large; the alimentary canal two feet long; the right te&s;ticle round, the left one oblong and arched, which is the natural &s;tructure, &s;ince it was verified on a great number of &s;ubjects <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the mechani&s;m of the tongue has been a &s;ubject of admiration among all naturali&s;ts. Borelli and Aldrovandus have de&s;cribed the form and functions of that organ: <HI>Olaus Jacobaeus,</HI> in the Acts of Copenhagen, and Mery, in the Memoires of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, have delineated its curious anatomy. The tongue of the Green Woodpecker is, accurately &s;peaking, only the bony tip, and what is u&s;ually taken for the tongue is the <HI>os hy&ouml;ides</HI> inve&s;ted with a membranous coat, and ex|tending backwards into two long branches, at fir&s;t o&s;&s;eous, and afterwards cartilagi|nous: the&s;e, after encircling the windpipe, reflect towards the head, and running clo&s;e in a furrow along the &s;kull, they are in|&s;erted on the forehead at the root of the bill. They are ela&s;tic cords, furni&s;hed with an apparatus of mu&s;cles, both <HI>exten&s;ors</HI> and <HI>retractors,</HI> which &s;erve to move and direct this &s;ort of tongue. The whole is &s;heathed
<PB N="16" REF="30">
by the prolongation of the &s;kin, which lines the lower mandible, and which extends when the <HI>os hy&ouml;ides</HI> is protruded, and col|lap&s;es, in annular wrinkles, as that bone is retracted. The bony tip, which is the real tongue, is connected to the extremity, and covered with a &s;caly horn, be&s;et with &s;mall hooks bent back: and that it may be capable both to hold and to pierce its prey, it is naturally moi&s;tened with a vi&s;cous fluid, that di&s;tills from two excretory ducts which ri&s;e from a double gland.&mdash;After this &s;truc|ture the tongue of all the Woodpeckers is fa&s;hioned; indeed we might conclude from analogy, that it al&s;o obtains in &s;uch birds in general, as protrude their tongue by extending it.</P>
<P>The Green Woodpecker has a very large head, and can bri&s;tle the red feathers that cover its crown, which induced Pliny to term it tufted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cirrhas pico martio.</NOTE>.

<P>THIS bird, as &s;mall as the gold cre&s;ted wren, is the dwarf of the large family of Woodpeckers. It is not a creeper, and its &s;traight &s;quare bill &s;hews it to be a real Woodpecker.

<P>THOUGH I place this beautiful bird in the clo&s;e of the family of the Green Woodpecker, I mu&s;t remark, that it &s;eems to emerge from even the genus of the Woodpeckers, both by its habits and &s;ome of its features. Cate&s;by, who ob&s;erved it in Carolina, tells us, that it is oftene&s;t on the ground, and does not creep upon the trunks of trees, but perches on their branches like other birds. Yet its toes are di&s;po&s;ed two before, and two behind, like the Woodpeckers; and, like them too, the feathers of its tail are &s;tiff and hard; and, what is peculiar to it&s;elf, the &s;ide of each is terminated by two &s;mall filaments. Its

bill is, however, di&s;&s;imilar to that of the Woodpeckers; it is not &s;quared, but round|ed, and &s;omewhat curved, pointed, and not formed into an edge. If this bird re&s;embles then the Woodpeckers in the &s;tructure of its feet and tail, it differs in the &s;hape of the bill, and in its habitudes, which nece&s;|&s;arily re&s;ult from the conformation of that principal organ in birds.

It is about the &s;ize of the Green Wood|pecker, and is remarkable for its beautiful form, and the elegant di&s;po&s;ition of its rich colours; black &s;pots, like cre&s;cents and hearts, are &s;cattered on the &s;tomach and belly on a white ground of a dingy ca&s;t; the forepart of the neck is vinous cinereous or lilack, and, on the middle of the brea&s;t, there is a broad black zone, &s;haped like a cre&s;cent; the rump is white; the tail black above, and lined below with a fine yellow re&s;embling dead leaves; the upper &s;ide of the head, and the top of the neck, are of a lead gray, and the back of the head is marked with a fine &s;carlet &s;pot; from the corners of the bill two large black mu&s;ta|choes

<P>THIS is the third &s;pecies of the Euro|pean Woodpeckers. Its plumage is agreeably variegated with white and black, embelli&s;hed with red on the head and belly. The crown of the head is black, with a red bar on the occiput, and the hood terminates in a black point on the neck; thence ri&s;e two branches of black, one of which &s;tretches on each &s;ide to the root of the bill and marks a mu&s;tachoe, and the other de&s;cend|ing to the lower part of the neck, decorates it with a collar; this black &s;treak unites near the &s;houlder with the black piece that
<PB N="58" REF="73">
occupies the middle of the back; two great white &s;paces cover the &s;houlders; in each wing the great quills are brown, the others black, and all mixed with white; the whole of the black is deep, and the whole of the white is pure and unmixed; the red on the head is bright, and that of the belly is a fine &s;carlet. Thus the plumage of this bird is charmingly diver&s;ified, and &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of all the other Woodpeckers in beauty.</P>
<P>This de&s;cription an&s;wers only to the male exactly; the female figured in the <HI>Plan|ches Enlumin&eacute;es</HI> has no red on the back of the head. Some &s;potted Woodpeckers are clothed with a le&s;s beautiful plumage, and &s;ome even are entirely white. There is al&s;o a variety who&s;e colours appear more ob&s;cure, and though all the upper &s;ide of the head and the belly are red, the tint is pale and dull.</P>
<P>Of this variety, Bri&s;&s;on makes his &s;econd <HI>Variegated Woodpecker,</HI> though he had be|fore produced it under the name of the <HI>Great Variegated Woodpecker;</HI> yet the&s;e two birds are both nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, and have ever been referred to the &s;ame &s;pecies. Belon, who lived in an age when the rules of nomenclature and the errors of &s;y&s;ytem had not multiplied the divi&s;ions in the ar|rangement
<PB N="59" REF="74">
of natural objects, cla&s;&s;es all the&s;e varieties with his <HI>epeiche</HI> or Varie|gated Woodpecker. But Aldrovandus ju&s;tly blames both him and Turner for applying to that bird the name <HI>Picus Martius,</HI> which belongs only to the Green Woodpecker.</P>
<P>The Variegated Woodpecker &s;trikes a|gain&s;t the trees with bri&s;ker and harder blows than the Green Woodpecker; it creeps with great ea&s;e upwards, or down|wards, and horizontally under the branches; the &s;tiff quills of its tail &s;erve to &s;upport it, when it hangs in an inverted po&s;ture, and knocks keenly with its bill. It is a &s;hy bird; for when it perceives a per&s;on, it hides it&s;elf behind a branch and remains &s;till. Like the other Woodpeckers, it breeds in a hollow tree. In our provinces, it ap|proaches the habitations during winter, and &s;eeks to &s;ettle on the bark of fruit trees, where the cry&s;alids and eggs of in&s;ects are depo&s;ited in greater quantity than on the trees of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer during droughts, the Varie|gated Woodpeckers are often killed at the wood meres, whither the&s;e birds repair to drink: it approaches the &s;pot in &s;ilence, fluttering from tree to tree; and each time it halts it &s;eems anxiou&s;ly to examine if any
<PB N="60" REF="75">
danger threatens: it has an air of inquie|tude; it li&s;tens, and turns its head on all &s;ides, and even looks through the foliage to the ground below; and the lea&s;t noi&s;e is &s;ufficient to drive it back. When it reaches the tree next the mere, it de&s;cends from branch to branch, until it gets to the lowe&s;t on the margin of the water; it then dips its bill, and at each &s;ip, it hearkens, and ca&s;ts a look round it. After its thir&s;t is quenched, it retires quickly, without ma|king a pau&s;e as on its arrival. When it is &s;hot on a tree, it &s;eldom drops; but as long as a &s;park of life remains, it clings firmly with its nails, &s;o that one is often obliged to fire a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>This bird has a very large <HI>&s;ternum;</HI> its inte&s;tinal canal is &s;ixteen inches long, but there is no <HI>coecum;</HI> its &s;tomach is membra|nous; the point of its bill is bony, and five lines in length. An adult male which had been taken from a ne&s;t of five young, weighed two ounces and an half; the&s;e weighed three gros each, and their toes were di&s;po&s;ed as in the father; their bill wanted the two lateral ridges, which, in the adult, took their origin beyond the no&s;trils, went below them, and extended two thirds of the length of the bill; the nails, though

<P>THE plumage re&s;embles that of the Spot|ted Woodpecker; the back is black, with white di&s;po&s;ed in waves or rather &s;cales on the great quills of the wing, and the&s;e two colours form, when it is clo&s;ed, a check|ed bar: the under &s;urface of the body is white, variegated on the &s;ides with black &s;cales; two white &s;treaks &s;tretch backwards, one from the eye, the other from the bill, and the top of the head is red.</P>

The figure of this bird agrees perfectly with Bri&s;&s;on's de&s;cription of the <HI>Variegated Cayenne Woodpecker,</HI> except that the former has four toes as u&s;ual, and the latter only three. We cannot therefore doubt the exi&s;tence of three-toed Woodpeckers: Lin|naeus de&s;cribes one found in Dalecarlia; Schmidt, one in Siberia; and we are informed by Lottinger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Extract of a letter from M. Lottinger, to M. de Mont|beillard, dated Stra&s;burg, 22d September, 1774.</NOTE> that it occurs al&s;o in Switzerland. The three-toed Wood|pecker appears therefore to inhabit the north of both continents. Ought the want of the toe to be regarded as a &s;pecific character, or con&s;idered as only an accidental de|fect? It would require a great many ob&s;er|vations to an&s;wer that que&s;tion; but it may be denied that the &s;ame bird inhabits al&s;o the equatorial regions, though after Bri&s;|&s;on it is termed <HI>the Spotted Cayenne Wood|pecker</HI> in <HI>the Planches Enluminees.</HI></P>
<P>After this long enumeration of the birds of both continents that are akin to the Woodpeckers, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that we have been obliged to reject &s;ome &s;pecies no|ticed by our nomenclators. The&s;e are the third, eighth, and twentieth, which Bri&s;|&s;on ranges with the Woodpeckers, Seba with the herons, and Moehring with the
<PB N="77" REF="92">
crows. Klein calls the&s;e birds <HI>harpooneers;</HI> becau&s;e, according to Seba, they dart from the air upon fi&s;h and transfix them.

<P>THE genus of the&s;e birds, of which we know only two &s;pecies, appears manife&s;tly di&s;criminated, and con&s;titutes the intermediate link between the Wood|peckers and the Creepers. The fir&s;t and large&s;t &s;pecies re&s;embles mo&s;t the creepers, by its curved bill; and the &s;econd, on the contrary, is more analogous to the Wood|peckers &s;ince it has a &s;traight bill. Both of them have three toes before and one be|hind, like the Creepers; and at the &s;ame time the quills of their tail are &s;tiff and pointed, like the Woodpeckers.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was ten inches long; its head and throat &s;potted with rufous and white; the upper &s;ide of the body, rufous, and the
<PB N="78" REF="93">
under&s;ide, yellow, &s;triped tran&s;ver&s;ely with blacki&s;h; the bill and feet black.</P>
<P>The &s;econd was only &s;even inches long; its head, neck, and brea&s;t, &s;potted with rufous and white; the under&s;ide of the body is rufous, and the belly ru&s;ty brown; the bill gray, and the feet blacki&s;h.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e birds have very nearly the &s;ame natural habits; they creep again&s;t trees like Woodpeckers, &s;upporting them&s;elves by the tail; they bore the bark and the wood with much noi&s;e, and they feed upon the in&s;ects thus detected: they inhabit the fore&s;ts and &s;eek the vicinity of &s;prings, and rivulets. The two &s;pecies live together, and often on the &s;ame tree, on which ma|ny other &s;mall birds are perched; yet they are only fond of each others &s;ociety, and never intermix the breed. They are very agile, and flutter from tree to tree, but ne|ver perch or fly to a di&s;tance. They are commonly found in the interior parts of Guiana, where the natives of the country confound them with the Woodpeckers; which is the rea&s;on that they have received no appropriated name. It is probable that they al&s;o inhabit the other warm climates of America, though no traveller has men|tioned them.</P>

<P>This bird holds it&s;elf very erect on the branch where it &s;its, and its body is even bent backwards. It clings in the &s;ame way to the trunk of a tree when it &s;leeps; but it never clambers like the Woodpecker, nor &s;eeks its food under the bark; its bill, which is nine lines in length and fa&s;hioned as tho&s;e of the Woodpeckers, does not a&s;&s;i&s;t it in finding its nouri&s;hment, and is nothing but the &s;heath of a large tongue three or four fingers in length, which it darts into the ant-hills, and which it again draws back covered with ants that &s;tick to its vi&s;cous humidity. The point of the tongue is &s;harp and horny; and, to give it exten|&s;ion, two great mu&s;cles ri&s;e from its root, and, after inclo&s;ing the larynx, and &s;tretch|ing to the crown of the head as in the Woodpeckers, are in&s;erted in the front.

All tho&s;e parts of animals which are overgrown or mi&s;placed, and which are u&s;ele&s;s or incon|venient, ought not to be ranged in the great plan of the univer&s;e; they &s;hould be imputed to her caprice or over&s;ight, which however tend equally to their object, &s;ince the&s;e extraordinary productions evince, that whatever can be, actually exi&s;ts; and that though a regular &s;ymmetry commonly ob|tains, the di&s;orders, the exce&s;&s;es, and the defects which are permitted, demon&s;trate the extent of that power which is con|fined not to tho&s;e ideas of proportion and &s;y&s;tem that we are apt to regard as the &s;tandards.</P>
<P>And as nature has be&s;towed on mo&s;t ani|mals all the qualities that con&s;pire to beau|ty and perfection of form, &s;he has al&s;o admitted more than one defect in her care|le&s;s productions. The enormous and u&s;e|le&s;s bill of the Toucan includes a tongue, &s;till more u&s;ele&s;s, and who&s;e &s;tructure is
<PB N="105" REF="123">
very uncommon; it is not fle&s;hy or cartila|ginous as in other birds, but a real feather mi&s;placed.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Toucan</HI> means <HI>feather</HI> in the language of Brazil, and <HI>Toucan tabourac&eacute;,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>feathers for dancing,</HI> is ap|plied by the natives to that bird which furni&s;hes them with the decorations worn on fe&s;tival days. Indeed the&s;e birds, &s;o &s;hapele&s;s and mon&s;trous in their bill and tongue, have a brilliant plumage; their throat is orange of the mo&s;t vivid hue; and though &s;uch beautiful feathers are found only in &s;ome &s;pecies of Toucans, yet have they given name to the whole genus. The&s;e feathers are even in Europe in reque&s;t for making muffs. The huge bill of the Toucan has acquired it other honours, and tran&s;lated it among their &s;outhern con&s;tel|lations, where nothing is admitted but what is &s;triking or wonderful <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal des Ob&s;ervations Phy&s;iques du P. Feuill&eacute;e, p. 428.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides the ex|ce&s;&s;ive length of this bill, it is through its whole length wider than the head of the bird; Lery has termed it, <HI>the bill of bills</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage du Bra&s;il. p. 174.</NOTE>, other voyagers have named the Toucan the <HI>bird all-bill</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dampier's Voyage round the World.</NOTE>, and the Creoles of Cayenne
<PB N="106" REF="124">
apply to it the epithet of <HI>Grosbeak.</HI> The mag|nitude of the bill would exceedingly fatigue the head and neck, were it not very thin, in&s;omuch that it may ea&s;ily be cru&s;hed be|tween the fingers. Authors <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot">Hernandez.</NOTE> were there|fore mi&s;taken in a&s;&s;erting, that the Tou|cans bored trees, like the Woodpeckers; or they were at lea&s;t mi&s;lead by the Spaniards, who have confounded the&s;e birds under the &s;ame name <HI>carpenteros</HI> (carpenter), or <HI>tacatacas</HI> in the language of Peru. But it is certain that the Toucans are very differ|ent from the Woodpeckers, and could not imitate them in that habit; and indeed Scaliger has before us remarked that as their bill was hooked downwards, it &s;eemed im|po&s;&s;ible for them to make a perforation.</P>
<P>The form of this huge unwieldy bill is very different in each mandible: the upper one is bent into the &s;hape of a fickle, rounded above, and hooked at the extre|mity; the under one is &s;horter, narrower and le&s;s curved below. Both of them have indentings on the edges, but which are much more perceptible on the upper than on the under; and what appears &s;till more &s;ingular, the&s;e indentings do not fit into each other, nor even corre&s;pond in their relative po&s;ition, tho&s;e on the right &s;ide not
<PB N="107" REF="125">
being oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e on the left, for they begin more or le&s;s behind, and end al&s;o more or le&s;s forward.</P>
<P>The tongue of the Toucans is, if po&s;&s;i|ble, more wonderful than the bill: they are the only birds which may be &s;aid to have a feather in&s;tead of a tongue, and a feather it certainly is, though the &s;haft is a cartilaginous &s;ub&s;tance two lines broad; for on both &s;ides there are very clo&s;e barbs, entirely like tho&s;e of ordinary feathers, and which are longer the nearer they are in&s;erted to the extremity. With an organ &s;o &s;ingular and &s;o different from the ordinary &s;ub&s;tance and organization of the tongue, we might &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e birds were mute; yet they have a voice as well as the re&s;t, and often utter a &s;ort of whi&s;tling, which is reiterated &s;o quickly, and with &s;uch continuance that they have been denominated the <HI>preaching birds.</HI> The &s;avages a&s;cribe great virtues to this feathery tongue <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de la Condamine &s;peaks of a Toucan which he &s;aw on the banks of the Maragnon, who&s;e mon&s;trous bill is red and yellow; its tongue, he &s;ays, which re&s;embles a delicate feather, is e&s;teemed to have great virtues. <HI>Voyage a la riviere des Amazones, Paris,</HI> 1745. <HI>See</HI> al&s;o Gemelli Carreri, <HI>Paris,</HI> 1719. tom.

Some authors <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willughby and Barrere.</NOTE> have &s;uppo&s;ed that the Toucans had no no&s;trils;
<PB N="108" REF="126">
but we may &s;ee them by &s;troking a&s;ide the feathers at the ba&s;e of the bill, which in mo&s;t &s;pecies conceal them; in others, they are bare, and con&s;equently very apparent.</P>
<P>The Toucans have nothing in common with the Woodpeckers, but the di&s;po&s;ition of their toes, two placed before and two behind. Even in this character, a di&s;tinc|tion may be perceived; the toes are much longer and differently proportioned than in Woodpeckers; the outer fore-toe is almo&s;t as long as the whole foot, which is indeed very &s;hort, and the other toes are al&s;o very long, the two inner ones are the lea&s;t &s;o. The feet of the Toucans are only half the length of the legs, &s;o that they cannot walk, but hop, and that awkwardly: the feet are not feathered, but covered with long &s;oft &s;cales. The nails are proportioned to the length of the toes, arched, and &s;omewhat flattened, ob|tu&s;e at the end, and furrowed below length|wi&s;e by a channel; they are of no &s;ervice to the bird in attack or defence, or even for climbing, but only to &s;upport it firmly on the boughs on which it perches.</P>
<P>The Toucans are &s;cattered through all the warm parts of South America, and never occur in the ancient continent. They flit rather than migrate, following the ma|turity of the fruits on which they feed,
<PB N="109" REF="127">
particularly tho&s;e of the palms; and as the&s;e trees delight in wet places near the margin of water, the Toucans affect &s;uch &s;ituations, and &s;ometimes they even lodge on the mangroves, which grow in deluged mud. And hence it has been &s;uppo&s;ed that they eat fi&s;hes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez and Nieremberg.</NOTE>, but the&s;e mu&s;t at lea&s;t be very &s;mall, &s;ince they are obliged to &s;wallow their food entire.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds generally go in &s;mall bodies from &s;ix to ten; their flight is heavy and laborious, owing to the &s;hortne&s;s of their wings and the weight of their enormous bill; yet they ri&s;e above the talle&s;t trees, on the &s;ummits of which they are almo&s;t always perched, and in continual flutter, but the vivacity of their motions di&s;pels not their dull air, for the huge bill gives them a &s;erious melancholy countenance, and their large dull eyes augment the effect: in &s;hort, though lively and active, they appear the more heavy and awkward.</P>
<P>As they breed in the holes abandoned by the Woodpeckers, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed they excavate the&s;e them&s;elves. They lay only two eggs, yet all the &s;pecies contain abundance of individuals. They may be ea&s;ily tamed, if taken young; it is even
<PB N="110" REF="128">
&s;aid that they will propagate in the dome&s;|tic &s;tate. They are not difficult to rear, for they &s;wallow whatever is thrown to them, bread, fle&s;h, or fi&s;h; they al&s;o with the point of their bill, lay hold of the bits that are held near them; they to&s;s the&s;e up, and receive them in their wide throat. But when they are obliged to provide for them&s;elves, and to gather their food from the ground, they &s;eem to grope, and &s;eize the crumb &s;idewi&s;e, that it may leap up, and be caught in its fall. They are &s;o de|licate to impre&s;&s;ions of cold, as to be affect|ed by the coolne&s;s of evening in the hotte&s;t climates, even of the new continent; they have been ob&s;erved in the hou&s;e to make a bed of herbs, of &s;traw, and of whatever they could gather. Their &s;kin is in gene|ral blue under the feathers, and their fle&s;h, though black and hard, is yet palatable.</P>
<P>The genus of the&s;e birds &s;ubdivides it&s;elf into the Toucans and Aracaris: the&s;e differ from each other; 1. in &s;ize, the Toucans being much larger than the Aracaris, 2. by the dimen&s;ions and the &s;ub&s;tance of their bill, which in the Aracaris is much longer, harder, and &s;olider; 3. by their tail, which is longer in the Aracaris, and very &s;en&s;ibly tapered, whereas it is rounded in

<P>Two birds of this kind have been figu|red in the <HI>Planches Enluminees;</HI> the fir&s;t under the denomination of the <HI>Yellow throated Toucan, of Cayenne</HI> <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Rampha&s;tos Dicolorus.</HI> "It is blacki&s;h; its breast, its belly, its vent, and its rump red; $ts throat yellow."</NOTE>, and the &s;econd under that of the <HI>yellow-throated tou|can of Brazil.</HI> <NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Rampha&s;tos-Tucanus.</HI> "It is blacki&s;h; a bar on its belly, its vent and ramp yellow."</NOTE> But they inhabit equal|ly both countries, and appear to us to form the &s;ame &s;pecies. The difference in the colour of their bill, in the extent of the yellow plate on the throat, as well as in the vivacity of their colours, may be owing to the age of the bird: It is certain, that the &s;uperior coverts of the tail are yellow in &s;ome individuals, and red in others. In
<PB N="114" REF="133">
both, the head and upper &s;ide of the body, the wings, and tail, are black; the throat orange, more or le&s;s bright; under the throat, a red bar of various width &s;tretches on the brea&s;t; the belly is blacki&s;h, and the inferior coverts of the tail are red; the bill is black with a blue &s;tripe running from its top all its length: the ba&s;e of the bill is &s;urrounded by a pretty broad yellow or white bar; the no&s;trils are concealed in the feathers at the root, and their apertures are round; the legs are twenty lines in length, and blui&s;h; the bill, four inches and a half long, and &s;eventeen lines high above the ba&s;e; the whole bird, from the end of the bill to the extremity of the tail, is nineteen inches; and if from this we deduct &s;ix inches and two or three lines for the tail, and four inches and a half for the bill, there remains hardly nine inches for the length of the head and body.</P>
<P>It is from this &s;pecies of Toucan, that tho&s;e brilliant feathers u&s;ed as ornaments are obtained; all the yellow part is cut off from the &s;kin, and &s;old at a high price.

<P>THIS Toucan has a yellow neck, like the preceding; but its brea&s;t is a fine red, which in the other is black.

<HEAD>The CALAOS, Or RHINOCEROS BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een that the Toucans, &s;o re|markable for their enormous bill, belong all of them to the continent of South America. We are now to view other birds, natives of Africa and of India, which wear a bill as prodigiou&s;ly large, and of a &s;hape &s;till more exce&s;&s;ively mon&s;trous. For nature is more vigorous in the ancient than in the new world, and even her errors are more luxuriant.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the uncommon expan|&s;ion and cumbrous overgrowth which &s;wells and deforms the bill of the&s;e birds, we are &s;truck with the incongruity and di&s;cordance of their &s;tructure. But nature exhibits other examples of incon&s;i&s;tency; the <HI>cro&s;s|bills</HI> are almo&s;t incapacitated for taking their food, and are unable to defend them|&s;elves again&s;t even the weake&s;t and &s;malle&s;t tribes. In the quadrupeds al&s;o, the &s;loths, the ant-eaters, the &s;hort-tailed manis, &amp;c. naked or mi&s;erable, by rea&s;on of the &s;hape of their body, and of the di&s;proportion of their members, drag out a laborious and

The life of &s;uch fee|ble imperfect &s;pecies is protected by &s;olitude alone, and could never be &s;upported and maintained, but in de&s;ert rece&s;&s;es, untrod by man or the powerful animals.</P>
<P>The bill of the Calao, though large, is weak and ill compacted, and &s;o far from be|ing u&s;eful, it proves burthen&s;ome: it is like a long lever where the force is applied near the <HI>fulcrum,</HI> and con&s;equently the extremity acts feebly: its &s;ub&s;tance is &s;o tender, that it &s;hivers by the lea&s;t attrition, and the&s;e accidental cracks have been mi&s;ta|ken by naturali&s;ts for a regular and natural indenting. The&s;e produce a remarkable effect on the bill of the Rhinoceros Calao; for the mandibles meet only at the point and the re&s;t remains wide open, as if they were not formed for each other.

In the Manilla Calao, a &s;well may be per|ceived on the top of the bill: this is more di&s;tinct in the Molucca Calao: &s;till more con&s;iderable in the Aby&s;&s;inian Calao: the excre&s;cence is prodigious in tho&s;e of the Philippines and Malabar, and quite mon|&s;trous in the Rhinoceros-Calao.

<P>THIS bird has a very large bill, but this is &s;imple, and without any excre&s;cence; yet &s;till fa&s;hioned as in the other Calaos, like a &s;ickle. It re&s;embles them for the mo&s;t part al&s;o in its natural habits, and occurs too in the hotte&s;t climates of the ancient continent. The negroes of Senegal give it the name of Tock, which we &s;hall retain. The young bird differs very much from the adult; for its bill is black, and its plumage a&s;h-gray, and, with age, the bill becomes red, and the plumage blacki&s;h on the up|per &s;ide of the body, on the wings, and on the tail, and whiti&s;h quite round the head, on the neck, and on all the lower parts of the body: it is al&s;o &s;aid, that the legs are originally black, and grow afterwards red|di&s;h. It is not therefore &s;urprizing that Bri&s;&s;on has made two &s;pecies; his fir&s;t de|&s;ignation
<PB N="135" REF="155">
&s;eems applicable to the adult Tock, and his &s;econd to the young Tock.</P>
<P>This bird has three toes before and only one behind: the middle one is clo&s;ely con|nected to the outer toe as far as the third joint, and much more loo&s;ely to the inner toe, and at the fir&s;t joint only. The bill is very thick, bent downwards, and &s;lightly indented on the &s;ides.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject which we de&s;cribe was twenty inches long; its tail &s;ix inches, ten lines: its bill three inches five lines, and twelve lines and a half thick at the ba&s;e; its horny &s;ub&s;tance of the bill is thin and light: the legs are eighteen lines high.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds which are pretty common in Senegal, are very &s;imple when young; they &s;uffer a per&s;on to approach and catch them; and they may be &s;hot at without being &s;cared, or even without their &s;tirring. But age in&s;tructs them by experience; their di&s;|po&s;ition, quite alters; they grow extremely &s;hy, and e&s;cape to the &s;ummits of the trees; while the young ones remain on the lowe&s;t branches and the bu&s;hes, and continue per|fectly &s;till, their head &s;unk between the &s;houlders, &s;o that the bill only is &s;een. The young birds &s;carce ever fly, whereas the old ones &s;oar in a lofty and rapid cour&s;e.
<PB N="136" REF="156">
The young Tocks are numerous in the months of Augu&s;t and September: th$$ may be caught with the hand, and app$$r as tame as if they had been reared in the hou&s;e. But this conduct proceeds from their &s;tupidity, for they do not pick up the food that is thrown to them, and it mu&s;t be put in their bill; which affords a pre|&s;umption that the parents are obliged to maintain them for a great length of time.</P>
<P>The Tock is very different from the Tou|can, and yet one of our mo&s;t intelligent na|turali&s;ts has confounded them. Adan&s;on &s;ays, in his voyage to Senegal, that he kil|led two Toucans in that country; but it is certain that there are no Toucans in Afri|ca.

<P>George Camel has, along with the other birds of the Philippines, de&s;cribed a &s;pecies of Calao, which &s;eems to be much like the pre&s;ent, but not exactly the &s;ame. His ac|count was communicated to the Royal So|ciety of London, by Dr. Petiver, and printed in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, <HI>No.</HI> 285. <HI>Art. III.</HI> It there appears, that this bird termed <HI>Calao</HI> or <HI>Cagao</HI> by the people of India, does not haunt &s;treams, but inhabits the uplands, and even the mountains, living on the fruits of the <HI>baliti,</HI> which is a &s;ort of wild fig-tree, and al&s;o on almonds, pi&s;|tachio nuts, &amp;c. which it &s;wallows entire. We &s;hall here in&s;ert a tran&s;lation: "The bill is black; the rump and back du&s;ky a&s;h colour; the head &s;mall, and black about the eyes; the eye la&s;hes black and long; the eyes blue; the bill is a &s;pan in length, &s;omewhat curved, &s;errated, diaphanous, and of the colour of cinnabar; the lower man|dible is about an inch and a half broad at the middle; the upper mandible is a palm in height, more than a span in length, the top flat and about a &s;pan in mea&s;ure, and bearing a helmet of a palm in breadth. The tongue is &s;mall for &s;uch a bill, being hardly

an inch. Its voice re&s;embles more the grunting of a &s;ow, or the bellowing of an ox, than the cry of a bird.

The Gentiles revere this bird, and relate &s;tories of its fighting with the Crane which they call <HI>Tipul</HI> or <HI>Tihol;</HI> they &s;ay, that after this battle, the Cranes were obliged to remain in the wet grounds, and that the Calaos would not &s;uffer them to approach the mountains <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are &s;orry to remark that the tran&s;lation which the Count de Buffon here gives is exceedingly inaccurate. <HI>Se&s;|quiuncia</HI> is rendered <HI>half an inch,</HI> &amp;c.

That is, the idola|trous Indians have a &s;uper&s;titious veneration for the Calao, and relate that it has entered into a compact with the Crane that it &s;hould live contented with its mar&s;hes, and the Calao with the woods, thence the Crane, if it perch on a tree, cannot &s;tir from the &s;pot, as a puni&s;hment for infring|ing the treaty; and on the other hand, the Calao incurs the &s;ame puni&s;hment, if it alights in the low fens.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>The Rhinoceros bird &s;een by Bontius in the i&s;land of Java, is much larger than the European Raven; it has an offen&s;ive &s;mell, and is very ugly. Bontius thus proceeds; "Its plumage is all black, and its bill oddly fa&s;hioned; for on its upper part, there ri&s;es an excre&s;cence of a horny &s;ub&s;tance which extends forward, and then bends back towards the top like a horn, and which

It is found in Sumatra, in the Philippines, and in other hot parts of India."</P>
<P>Bontius relates &s;ome particulars with re|gard to the oeconomy of the&s;e birds; he &s;ays that they live on carrion, and com|monly follow the hunters of wild cows, boars, and &s;tags, who to le&s;&s;en the trouble of conveying their game, are obliged to divide carca&s;es, and &s;end them to the boats on the river, le&s;t the Calaos &s;hould devour them. Yet the&s;e birds attack no animals but rats and mice, and for that rea&s;on the Indians rear &s;ome of them. Bontius tells us that the Calao fir&s;t flattens the mou&s;e in its bill to &s;often it; and then to&s;&s;es it in the air, receives it in its wide throat, and &s;wallows it entire: indeed this is the only mode of eating compatible with the &s;tructure of its bill, and the &s;mallne&s;s of its tongue, which is concealed almo&s;t in the throat <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, <HI>No.</HI> 285.</NOTE></P>

The Alcyon was not common in Greece or Italy; Choerephon, in Lucian's Dialogues <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dial. Alcyon.</NOTE>, admires its &s;ong as a novelty. Ari&s;totle and Pliny &s;ay, that the appearance of the Alcyon was rare and fugitive, that it wheeled rapidly round the &s;hips, and in|&s;tantly retired into its little grot on the &s;hore <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, lib. v. 9.

<P>The King-fi&s;her may be recognized al&s;o from the mode in which the Alcyon caught its prey: Lycophron calls it the diver <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE>, and Oppian &s;ays that <HI>it drops perpendicularly, and plunges into the Sea.</HI> This peculiarity of diving vertically has given occa&s;ion to the Italian appellation <HI>piombino,</HI> or plummet.

The love &s;ea&s;on of the Alcyon, which was placed about the time of the &s;ol&s;tice, is the only circum&s;tance that does not coincide with the hi&s;tory of the King fi&s;her, which however breeds early and before the vernal equinox. But, be&s;ides that this fable may have been added for embelli&s;hment, it is po&s;&s;ible that, in a hotter climate, the amours of the King-fi&s;her commenced ear|lier. There are different opinions too with regard to the time of the Alcyonian days: Ari&s;totle &s;ays that in the Grecian Archi|pelago, they were not always contiguous to the &s;ol&s;tice, but more con&s;tantly &s;o in the &s;ea of Sicily <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib. v.</HI> 8.</NOTE>.

<P>WE form this name by contraction for <HI>achalalactli</HI> or <HI>michalalactli,</HI> which the bird receives in Mexico, according to Fernandez. It is one of the large&s;t of the King-fi&s;hers, being near &s;ixteen inches long; but its colours are not &s;o brilliant as tho&s;e of the others: blui&s;h gray is &s;pread over all the upper&s;ide of the body, and that colour is variegated on the wings with white fringes in fe&s;toons at the point of the quills, the large&s;t of which are blacki&s;h, and inter&s;ected within by broad white indent|ings; tho&s;e of the tail are marked with broad &s;tripes of white; the under&s;ide of the body is che&s;nut-rufous, which grows more dilute as it ri&s;es on the brea&s;t, where it is &s;caled or mailed with gray; the throat is white, and that colour, extending on the &s;ide of the neck, makes an entire circuit, and hence Nieremberg calls it <HI>the collared bird;</HI> all the head and the nape of the

neck are of the &s;ame blui&s;h gray with the back. This is a migratory bird; it ar|rives at a certain time of the year in the northern provinces of Mexico, and proba|bly comes from the hotter regions, for it is found in th&egrave; Antilles, and we received it from Martinico. Adan&s;on &s;ays, that <HI>it oc|curs likewi&s;e, though rarely, in Senegal, in the places near the mouth of the Niger.</HI> But the difficulty of &s;uppo&s;ing that a Mexican bird could be found al&s;o in Senegal &s;truck him&s;elf, and he &s;ought to trace the differ|ences between the <HI>Achalalactli</HI> of Fernan|dez and Nieremberg and this African King-fi&s;her; and it thence appears that the bird de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on, and delineated in our <HI>Planches Enluminees</HI> is not the real Mexican Achalalactli, but that of Senegal.

<HEAD>The AQUATIC BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Aquatic are the only cla&s;s of birds, which, to their common inheritance of the air and of the earth, join al&s;o the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ea. Numerous &s;pecies, containing va&s;t multitudes of individuals, inhabit its &s;hores and its level &s;urface; they float on the billows with as much ea&s;e and with more &s;ecurity than they &s;oar in their native element. Their provi&s;ions are ever abundant, their prey cannot e&s;cape their pur&s;uit: &s;ome plunge into the waves, others only &s;weep the face of the water: all of them dwell on the fluctuating face of the deep, as if it were a &s;table abode; they form a great &s;ociety, and live in tranquillity amid&s;t the &s;torms: they &s;eem even to play with the billows, to contend with the winds, and to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the vehemence of the tempe&s;t, without apprehending or &s;uffering &s;hipwreck.</P>
<P>It is with reluctance that they leave their favourite re&s;idence, and never until the concerns of incubation detain them on &s;hore, or permit only &s;hort excur&s;ions into the &s;ea; but, as &s;oon as their young are
<PB N="225" REF="249">
hatched, they introduce them into their proper element: there, they may continue as long as they chu&s;e; no water can penetrate their plumage, and when fatigued by flying, they may recruit their exhau&s;ted vigor by re&s;ting on the &s;urface. The long dark nights, or the continued violence of &s;torms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The di&s;order of the elements (in a great &s;torm) drove not the birds from us: from time to time a <HI>Black Tern</HI> fluttered on the troubled face of the &s;ea, and broke the force of the waves by expo&s;ing it&s;elf to their action.

Yet Captain Cook advi&s;es to regard the appearance of the&s;e birds as no certain &s;ign <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"The Blue Petrels which are found on this immen&s;e &s;ea are no le&s;s in&s;en&s;ible to cold than the Penquins.

<P>The &s;hape and confirmation of the&s;e birds &s;hew &s;ufficiently that they are de&s;tined by nature to inhabit the watry element; their body is arched and bulged like the hulk of a &s;hip, and this figure was perhaps copied in the fir&s;t con&s;truction of ve&s;&s;els; their neck, which ri&s;es on a projecting brea&s;t, repre&s;ents the prow; their &s;hort tail, collected into a &s;ingle bundle, &s;erves as a rudder <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, <HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI> Lib. ii. 5.</NOTE>; their broad and palmated feet perform the office of oars; and their thick down, gli&s;tening with oil, which entirely inve&s;ts them, is impenetrable by humidity, and, at the &s;ame time, enables them to float more lightly on the &s;urface of the water <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot"><P>"The birds of warm countries are moderately cloathed, while tho&s;e of cold countries, particularly &s;uch as fly ince&s;|&s;antly on the &s;ea, have a prodigious quantity of feathers, each of which is double."</P>

Be&s;ides they can repo&s;e on the &s;mooth track which the ve&s;&s;el leaves." <HI>Remarks made by the Vi&s;count de Querhoent.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. This <HI>Alcyon</HI> of the mariners is different from the true Alcyon of the ancients or the King-fi&s;her; it is pro|bably a &s;ea-&s;wallow.</P></NOTE>
The habits and oeconomy of the&s;e birds corre&s;pond al&s;o to their organization; they never &s;eem happy but in their appropriated element; they are
<PB N="227" REF="251">
aver&s;e to alight on the land; and the lea&s;t roughne&s;s of the ground hurts their &s;oles, which are &s;oftened by the perpetual bath|ing. The water is to them the &s;cene of plea&s;ure and repo&s;e, where all their motions are performed with facility, and their vari|ous evolutions traced with elegance and grace. View the Swans moving &s;weetly along, or &s;ailing maje&s;tically with expanded plumage upon the wave; they gaily &s;port, they dive and again emerge with gentle un|dulations, and &s;oft energy expre&s;&s;ive of tho&s;e &s;entiments which are the foundation of love: the Swan is the emblem of gracefulne&s;s, the quality which fir&s;t commands our atten|tion, even prior to the fa&s;cination of beauty.</P>
<P>The life of the Aquatic Birds therefore is more peaceful and le&s;s laborious than that of mo&s;t other tribes; &s;maller force is required in &s;wimming than is expended in
<PB N="228" REF="252">
flying; and the element which they inhabit perpetually yields them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: they rather light on their prey than &s;earch for it, and often a friendly wave conveys it within their reach, and they &s;eize it without trou|ble or fatigue. Their di&s;po&s;itions al&s;o are more innocent, and their habits more pacific. Each &s;pecies congregates, from mutual at|tachment; they never attack their compa|nions nor de&s;troy other birds; and, in this great and peaceful nation, the &s;trong never oppre&s;s the weak. Very different from tho&s;e tyrants of the air and of the land, which &s;pread through their empire di&s;order, deva&s;|tation, and war; the winged inhabitants of the water, live in profound harmony with each other, and are never polluted by the blood of their kindred: they re&s;pect even the whole cla&s;s of birds, and employ their &s;trength and their weapons only again&s;t the abject &s;warms of in&s;ects, and the dumb tribes of fi&s;hes. Yet mo&s;t of the Aquatic Birds have a keen appetite, and are furni&s;hed with arms corre&s;ponding. Many &s;pecies, &s;uch as the Goo&s;ander, the Brent|goo&s;e, the Shell-drake, &amp;c. have the inner edges of their bill &s;errated with &s;harp indentings, the better to &s;ecure their prey; all of them almo&s;t are more voracious than the land birds, and there are &s;ome, as the
<PB N="229" REF="253">
Ducks and Gulls, &amp;c. which devour indi&s;|criminately carrion and entrails.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t divide the numerous cla&s;s of Aquatic Birds into two great families: &s;uch as &s;wim and have palmated feet; and &s;uch as haunt the &s;hores and have divided feet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, <HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI> Lib. ix. 16.</NOTE>. The latter are differently &s;haped, their body being &s;lender and tall, and as their feet are not webbed, they cannot dive or re&s;t on the water; they keep near the margin, and, wading with their tall legs among the &s;shallows, they &s;earch by means of their long neck and bill for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the mud: they are a &s;ort of amphibious animals, that occupy the limits between the land and the water, and fill up the gradations in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Thus the a&euml;rial inhabitants con&s;i&s;t of three divi&s;ions, which have each their &s;epa|rate abode: &s;ome are appointed by nature to re&s;ide on the land; others are de&s;tined to &s;ail on the water; and to an intermediate tribe, the confines of the&s;e two elements have been allotted: life has been varied in all its po&s;&s;ible forms, and the immen&s;e rich|ne&s;s of creation di&s;played to our admira|tion and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="254">
We have often had occa&s;ion to remark that none of the quadrupeds and few of the birds which inhabit the Southern re|gions of the one continent, are found in the other; being unable to traver&s;e the va&s;t extent of intervening ocean. But this law entirely fails in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance; the Aquatic birds occur equally in the Old and in the New World, and even in the remote&s;t i&s;lands of the habitable globe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the articles of the <HI>Flamingos,</HI> of the <HI>Pelican,</HI> of the <HI>Frigat,</HI> of the <HI>Tropic Bird,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. And this privilege is even extended to &s;uch as fre|quent only the &s;hores: for, by tracing the line of coa&s;t, they may arrive at the extre|mities of both continents; nor, in their progre&s;s, will they experience much change of climate, &s;ince the heat is tempered and the cold mitigated, by the &s;ea-breezes. Accord|ingly many &s;pecies of &s;hore birds, which in our continent retire to the North in &s;um|mer, &s;eem to have pa&s;&s;ed by degrees into the boreal tracts of America <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the articles of the <HI>Plovers,</HI> of the <HI>Herons,</HI> of the <HI>Spoon-bills,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Aquatic birds appear to be half-nocturnal <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE>; the Herons roam during the night; the Woodcock only begins to fly in the evening; the Bittern &s;till &s;creams after the decline of day; the Cranes are heard to
<PB N="231" REF="255">
cry aloft in the air, admid&s;t the &s;ilence and darkne&s;s of night; this al&s;o is the period when the Gulls range abroad, when the wild Gee&s;e and Ducks alight in our rivers, and &s;tay u&s;ually longer than during the day. The&s;e habits are derived from &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances connected with their &s;upport and &s;ecurity: the coolne&s;s of the evening en|tices the worms to come out of their holes; the fi&s;hes are then in motion, and the gene|ral ob&s;curity conceals the&s;e birds from their enemies. Yet not always prudent in di|recting their attacks, they &s;ometimes fall victims of their own ra&s;hne&s;s or impe|tuo&s;ity. We have found a King-fi&s;her in the belly of an Eel; the Pike often catches the birds that dive or glance over the &s;ur|face, and even tho&s;e which come to drink or bathe at the margin of the pool; and, in the frozen &s;eas, the Whales open their enormous jaws, to &s;wallow not only whole columns of Herrings and other fi&s;hes, but al&s;o the birds which hover in pur&s;uit of the&s;e, &s;uch as the Albatro&s;&s;es, the Penguins, and the Scoter Ducks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus nature, while &s;he be&s;tows great privileges on the birds of the water, annexes al&s;o to their condition &s;ome inconveniences; and &s;he has even withheld from them one of her noble&s;t gifts. None of them has
<PB N="232" REF="256">
the power of warbling, and what has been &s;aid of the &s;ong of the Swan is altogether fabulous. The voice of the Aquatic Birds is &s;trong, har&s;h, and loud, calculated to be heard at a di&s;tance, and to re&s;ound on the wide-&s;pread &s;hores: it con&s;i&s;ts of raucous notes, of cries, and of &s;creams, and has none of tho&s;e flexible and &s;oft accents, nor that &s;weet melody with which our rural chanters enliven the grove, when they pro|claim the delights of &s;pring and of love: as if the formidable element, the &s;cene of &s;torms, had for ever repelled the&s;e charm|ing birds, who&s;e peaceful &s;ong required days of &s;erenity and nights of calm; as if the ocean permitted its winged inhabitants to utter nothing but coar&s;e and &s;avage &s;ounds, which pierce through the horrors of the tempe&s;t, and are heard amid&s;t the roaring of the bla&s;t and the da&s;hing of the &s;urge.</P>
<P>The number of Aquatic birds, including tho&s;e which haunt the &s;hores, and reckoning the individuals, is perhaps equal to that of the Land-birds. If the latter are di&s;per&s;ed through the hills and the vales, through the fore&s;ts and the open fields: the former, plying by the edge of the water, or riding on the waves, inhabit a &s;econd element as va&s;t and as free as the air it&s;elf; their food,
<PB N="233" REF="257">
al&s;o, is more abundant, and depends not on the caprice of the &s;ea&s;ons, or on the produce of human indu&s;try. Hence, too, the water birds a&s;&s;ociate more habitually than the land birds, and form larger flocks; for in&s;tance, few &s;pecies of the&s;e, at lea&s;t of an equal bulk, are &s;o numerous, in the &s;tate of nature, as the Gee&s;e and the Ducks. In general, there is greater union among animals, the further they are removed from the controul of man.</P>
<P>But both the &s;pecies and the individuals of the land birds are more plenty in propor|tion as the climate is hotter; whereas the wa|ter birds &s;eem to prefer the cold regions. Ma|riners inform us that the Herring-gulls, the Penguins, and the Scoter-ducks appear in myriads on the frozen &s;hores of the North, as do the Albatro&s;&s;es, the Manchots, and the Petrels, on the frigid i&s;lets in the high &s;outhern latitudes.</P>
<P>Yet the birds of the land &s;eem to &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e of the water in fecundity; none of an equal &s;ize are &s;o prolific as the gallina|ceous tribe. Nor can this difference be attributed to the abundant and generous food which the dome&s;tic &s;tate affords, for the tame Goo&s;e and Duck never lay &s;o many eggs as the common Hen. The&s;e Aquatic
<PB N="234" REF="258">
birds are rather pri&s;oners than dome&s;tics; they &s;till retain the traces of their primaeval liberty, and &s;hew a degree of independence, which the land-fowl &s;eem to have totally lo&s;t. They die if kept confined; they re|quire to roam at large, and enjoy part of their natural freedom in the fre&s;hning pools. Nay, if their wings be not clipped, they will often join their wild brethren, and make their e&s;cape <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though there are in&s;tances of tame Ducks and Gee&s;e join|ing wild ones, they probably meet with har&s;h u&s;age from their a&s;&s;ociates: for the antipathy between the dome&s;tic and the wild birds &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e &s;pecies as in all others. The Sieur Irecourt, a per&s;on of veracity whom I have frequently cited, having put into a pond wild Ducks taken from the ne&s;t in a mar&s;h, with other tame Ducks of nearly the &s;ame age, the latter a&s;&s;ailed them, and in le&s;s than two or three days killed them outright.</NOTE>. The Swan, that ornament of the artificial lakes in our &s;uperb gardens, &s;ails along rather with the firm dignity of a ma&s;ter than the humble deportment of a &s;lave.</P>
<P>As dome&s;tication impo&s;es little con&s;traint on the Aquatic birds, it introduces but &s;light alterations in their &s;hape or plumage. The tame Duck admits of few varieties; while the Cock pre&s;ents &s;uch a number of new breeds, that they &s;eem almo&s;t to con|found and obliterate the original &s;tock. The birds of the water are al&s;o le&s;s known than tho&s;e of the land; and, by placing
<PB N="235" REF="259">
them on the ocean, nature &s;eems to have removed them from the empire of man.</P>
<P>The &s;eas which abound mo&s;t in fi&s;h, attract and e&s;tabli&s;h on their &s;hores infinite multitudes of Aquatic birds. Innumerable flocks inhabit the Sambal i&s;lands and the coa&s;t of the i&s;thmus of Panama, particu|larly on the Northern &s;ide; nor is the We&s;tern &s;ide of the continent le&s;s fre|quented on the Southern coa&s;t, but there are few on the Northern. Wafer a&s;&s;igns for the rea&s;on, that in the bay of Panama the fi&s;hes are not &s;o plenty as at the Sam|bal i&s;lands. The great rivers of North America are entirely covered with water birds. The &s;ettlers at New Orleans, who kill them on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, formed a &s;mall branch of commerce in the fat or oil extracted from them. Many i&s;lands have been called <HI>Bird I&s;lands,</HI> being de&s;ert and wholly over&s;pread with &s;ea-fowl. The i&s;land of <HI>Aves</HI> among others, fifty leagues to the leeward of Dominica is &s;ettled by unequaled numbers. There we find Plo|vers, Red-&s;hanks, Gallinules, Flamingos, Pelicans, Gulls, Frigats, Boobies, &amp;c. Labat, who publi&s;hes the&s;e facts, remarks, that this coa&s;t is exceedingly rich in fi&s;h, and that the high water mark is con&s;tantly covered by an immen&s;e quantity of &s;hells.
<PB N="236" REF="260">

At that &s;ea&s;on, when the waters of the Nile have &s;ub&s;ided, they obtain abundance of food; but the exce&s;&s;ive heats of &s;ummer drive them to more temperate climates; and they return again in winter, to avoid the &s;everity of the cold; the contrary is the ca&s;e with the Cranes, which vi&s;it us with the Gee&s;e in winter, when the Storks leave us." This remarkable difference is owing to that of the climates which the&s;e birds inhabit; the Gee&s;e and Ducks come from the North, to e&s;cape the rigors of the win|ter; the Storks leave the South, to avoid the &s;corching heats of &s;ummer <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot">Several authors pretend that the Storks do not retire in winter, but then lurk in caverns, or even at the bottom of lakes.

All the body, the head, the neck, and the tail, are inve&s;ted with white feathers, which below the neck are of a con&s;iderable length and pendulous; the quills and the great coverts of the wing are black glo&s;&s;ed with green, and when it is clo&s;ed, the quills next the body appear equal to the exterior ones, a property com|mon to all the Mar&s;h-birds; the orbits are naked and covered with a bright red &s;kin;

We know not whe her this bird migrates like the Stork, which it repre&s;ents in the New World.

<P>THIS bird is a native of Guiana, of Bra&s;il, and of &s;ome countries of North America, which it vi&s;its. It is as large as the Stork, but its body is more &s;lender and longer &s;haped; nor would it reach the height of the Stork, but for the length of its neck and legs, which are larger in proportion: it differs al&s;o by the &s;hape of its bill, which is &s;traight three fourths of its length, but curved at the point, very &s;trong and thick, not furrowed, and of an even roundne&s;s, gradually enlarging as it approaches the head, where it is &s;ix or &s;even inches in girth, and near eight inches long; and this large bill is of a very hard &s;ub|&s;tance, and &s;harp at the edges: the back of the head and the arch of the neck are covered with &s;mall brown feathers, &s;tiff, though loo&s;e: the quills of the wing and of the tail are black, with &s;ome blui&s;h or reddi&s;h re|flections; all the re&s;t of the plumage is

white: the front is bald, and only covered, like the orbits, by a dull blue &s;kin: the throat, which is equally naked of feathers, is inve&s;ted with a &s;kin capable of inflation and exten&s;ion; which has induced Cate&s;by to term it, very improperly, <HI>the Wood Pelican</HI> In fact, the &s;mall bag of the Couricaca differs little from that of the Stork, which al&s;o can dilate the &s;kin of its throat; whereas the Pelican carries a large &s;ac under its bill, and, be&s;ides has its feet pal|mated. Bri&s;&s;on has committed an over|&s;ight in referring the Couricaca to the ge|nus of Curlews, to which it bears no &s;ort of re&s;emblance.

He adds, that its neck is as thick as a man's arm; which is likewi&s;e true. But that author mentions, that the &s;kin on the back of the neck is white, and not red; which may be owing to the difference between the dead and the living &s;ubject.

<P>The Cranes fly very lofty, and arrange them&s;elves for their expedition; they form a triangle, almo&s;t i&s;o&s;celes, the better to cleave the air.

<P>The flight of the Crane is always &s;up|ported uniformly, though it is marked by different inflections; and the&s;e variations have been ob&s;erved to indicate the change of weather: a &s;agacity that may well be allowed to a bird, which, by the va&s;t height to which it &s;oars, is able to perceive or to feel the di&s;tant alterations and motions in the atmo&s;phere <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, Lib. ix. 10.</NOTE>.

The fens which invite them never occur in the mid&s;t of arid plains and burning &s;ands; and if a few tribes follow|ing gradually the chain of mountains, where the heats are mitigated, at la&s;t pa&s;s the equator and advance into the South, they become lo&s;t in tho&s;e countries, di&s;mem|bered from the re&s;t of the &s;pecies, and never join in the migrations to the North.

<P>IT is extremely probable that the Cranes have migrated from the one continent into the other, &s;ince they haunt the North|ern parts of Europe and of A&s;ia. Accord|ingly, we find in America a White Crane, and one or two kinds of Gray or Brown Cranes. But the White Crane, which in our Continent is only an accidental variety, appears to have formed in the other a per|manent race, di&s;criminated by &s;trong and decided characters; &s;o that we may con|ceive it as anciently &s;eparated from the common &s;pecies, and long modified by the influence of climate. It is as tall as our large&s;t Cranes, but of a &s;tronger and thicker make, its bill longer, its head bigger; its neck and legs not &s;o &s;lender: all the plu|mage is white, except the great quills of the wings, which are black, and the head,

which is brown; the crown is callous and covered with black hairs, &s;traggling and delicate, under which the reddi&s;h &s;kin ap|pears naked; a &s;imilar &s;kin covers the cheeks: the tuft of loo&s;e feathers in the tail is flat and pendant: the bill is fur|rowed above, and indented at the edges near the tip; it is brown, and &s;ix inches long. Cate&s;by has de&s;cribed this bird from an entire &s;kin given him by an Indian, who told him that the&s;e birds frequent, in great numbers, the lower parts of the rivers near the &s;ea in the beginning of &s;pring, and return to the mountains in &s;ummer. "This fact, &s;ays Cate&s;by, has been &s;ince confirmed by a white, who informed me that the&s;e Cranes are very noi&s;y, and are &s;een in the Savannas at the mouth of the Altamaha, and other rivers near St. Augu&s;|tine in Florida, and al&s;o in Carolina; but that they are never found further North."</P>

It pa&s;&s;ed the whole of the winter (1778) at Paris, without appearing to &s;uffer from the rigours of a climate &s;o different from its own.

<P>THIS bird, alike con&s;picuous by its mag|nitude and by its figure, is not only of a new &s;pecies, but of a di&s;tinct and de|tatched family; &s;o that it eludes and con|founds all our artificial cla&s;&s;ifications.

The &s;ubject which we de&s;cribe was three feet &s;ix inches high, the tar&s;us alone near a foot; a little above the knee, there were no feathers; the toes were thick and &s;hort armed with hooked nails; the mid-one is almo&s;t twice as long as the lateral ones, which are connected by a membrane near half their length, and the hind toe is very &s;trong: the neck is thick, the bill is &s;trong and cleft beyond the eyes; the upper part of the bill is equally and boldly hooked, nearly as in the Eagle, and it is pointed and &s;harp; the eyes are placed in a &s;ort of naked &s;kin, of an orange colour, which extends beyond the outer corner of the eye, and takes its origin at the root of the bill: there is be&s;ides a &s;ingu|lar character, which &s;till more &s;hows the double nature of this bird; it is an eye|brow formed of one row of black hairs, from &s;ix to ten lines in length <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This eye-brow is fifteen or &s;ixteen lines long, the la&s;hes are ran$ed very clo&s;e, widening at the ba&s;e, &s;cooped into channels, concave below, and convex above.</NOTE>: this fea|ture,

with the tuft of feathers on the top of its neck, its head like that of a bird of prey, its legs like tho&s;e of a Shore-bird, form altogether an extraordinary ambiguous a&s;|&s;emblage.</P>
<P>The habits of this bird are as mixed as its &s;tructure. Though it has the weapons of the rapacious birds, it is exempt from their ferocity; and it never employs its bill, either for defence or for attack. It &s;eeks &s;afety by flight, and often in the hurry of its e&s;cape, it takes leaps of eight or ten feet high. It is gentle and &s;prightly, and &s;oon grows familiar. At the Cape of Good Hope it has even been dome&s;ticated, and is pretty frequent in the hou&s;es of the colo|ni&s;ts: they find it up the country, a few leagues from the &s;hore; they take it young from the ne&s;t, and rear it as much for utility as plea&s;ure, for it de&s;troys Rats, Lizards, Toads and Serpents.</P>
<P>The Vi&s;count de Querhoent has commu|nicated the following ob&s;ervations on this bird. "When the Secretary," &s;ays that ex|cellent ob&s;erver, "lights on a &s;erpent, it fir&s;t tires him out, by &s;triking with its wings; it then lays hold of him by the tail, lifts him up on high, and drops him, which it repeats till the &s;erpent is killed. It &s;preads its wings, and is thus often &s;een running
<PB N="319" REF="351">
and flying at once. It ne&s;tles in bu&s;hes a few feet from the ground, and lays two eggs, which are white with ru&s;ty &s;pots. When di&s;turbed, it makes a hollow croak|ing. It is neither dangerous, nor mi&s;chie|vous. Its di&s;po&s;ition is gentle; and I have &s;een two birds of this kind live peaceably in a court-yard amid&s;t poultry. They were fed with fle&s;h, and were greedy after guts and entrails, which they held under their feet while devouring them, as they would have done a &s;erpent. They &s;lept every night together, and the head of each was turned to the tail of its companion."</P>
<P>This bird, though a native of Africa, &s;eems to accommodate it&s;elf to an Euro|pean climate; it is kept in &s;ome of the menageries of England and of Holland. Vo&s;maer who fed one in that of the Prince of Orange, has made &s;ome remarks on its manner of living. "It tears and &s;wallows greedily the fle&s;h that is offered to it, and does not refu&s;e fi&s;h. When it prepares it&s;elf to repo&s;e and &s;leep, it re&s;ts with its belly and brea&s;t upon the ground: a cry which it rarely utters re&s;embles that of the Eagle: its mo&s;t u&s;ual exerci&s;e is to walk with long &s;teps from one &s;ide to another, and for a con&s;iderable time without halting or &s;lack|ening

its pace <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This quality has probably conferred on it the name of <HI>Me&s;&s;enger,</HI> as the bundle of feathers on the top of the neck has procured that of <HI>Secretary;</HI> though Vo&s;maer &s;uppo&s;es it derived from the appellation of <HI>&s;agitary</HI> applied to it, becau&s;e it often amu&s;es it&s;elf by taking a &s;traw in its bill or its foot and darting it repeatedly into the air.</NOTE>: it is of a cheerful, quiet; and timid di&s;po&s;ition. If a per&s;on ap|proaches while it runs hither and thither with a &s;upercilious air, it makes a conti|nual cracking; but after it has recovered from its fright, it appears familiar, and even prying. When the painter was em|ployed in de&s;igning it, the bird drew near him, looked attentively upon his paper, &s;tretched out its neck, and erected the fea|thers of its head, as if it admired its figure. It often came, with its wings rai&s;ed and its head projected, to ob&s;erve curiou&s;ly what was doing. It thus approached me two or three times, when I was &s;itting at a table in its hut, in order to de&s;cribe it. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, or when it eagerly gathers &s;ome &s;craps, and in general when it is moved by curio&s;ity or de&s;ire, it bri&s;tles high the long feathers on the back of its head, which commonly fall irregularly on the top of the neck.

yet its excrements are liquid and white, like tho&s;e of the Heron. To eat with ea&s;e, it &s;quats on its heels, and thus half-repo&s;ed, it &s;wallows its food. Its &s;trength &s;eems to lie chiefly in the leg; if a live hen be pre|&s;ented, it hits her a violent blow with its &s;ole, and knocks her down by a &s;econd &s;troke. It treats rats in the &s;ame manner. It watches a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly before their holes. In general it prefers living to dead animals, and fle&s;h to fi&s;h."</P>
<P>It is not long that this &s;ingular bird has been known even at the Cape, &s;ince, neither Kolben, nor the others who have de&s;cribed the productions of that country, make any mention of it. Sonnerat found it in the Philippines, after having &s;een it at the Cape. We perceive &s;ome differences between his account and the preceding ones, that &s;eem to de&s;erve notice: Sonnerat, for in&s;tance, repre&s;ents the feathers of the cre&s;t as ri&s;ing on the neck at unequal intervals, and the longe&s;t as placed the lowe&s;t; but neither this order nor proportion occur in the &s;ub|ject which I in&s;pected, the&s;e feathers being collected into an irregular bunch: he adds, that they are bent in the middle next the body, and that their webs are cri&s;ped; Vo&s;maer gives the &s;ame &s;tatement yet in the one which we have de&s;cribed they were

&s;mooth. Are the&s;e differences to be attri|buted to the objects them&s;elves, or only to the de&s;criptions? But a &s;till greater di&s;|agreement occurs in the colour of the plumage, which Vo&s;maer &s;ays is of a blu|i&s;h lead gray, though we found it to be verg|ing on brown: he &s;ays that the bill is blui&s;h, and we found it to be black above and white below. The &s;ubject which we de&s;cribe is lodged in the cabinet of Dr. Mauduit; the two feathers do not as u&s;ual exceed the tail, they only project five inches beyond the wings when clo&s;ed. But ano|ther &s;ubject, from which our figure was taken, has three long feathers, &s;uch as they are de&s;cribed by Vo&s;maer and Sonnerat. We conceive this to be the character of the male. Sonnerat is mi&s;taken when he reckons the bill of the Secretary as <HI>gallina|ceous;</HI> which is the more &s;trange, as that naturali&s;t remarks that the bird it&s;elf is carnivorous.</P>

Amid&s;t the di&s;cordant &s;ounds of the &s;creaming birds and croaking reptiles, there is heard at intervals a powerful note, which drowns the re&s;t, and rebellows from the di&s;tant &s;hores: it is the cry of the Kamichi, a large black bird, di&s;tingui&s;hed by its voice and its armour. On each wing, it has two &s;trong &s;purs, and on its head a pointed horn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;avages of Guiana have named it <HI>Kamichi;</HI> tho&s;e of Brazil call it <HI>Anhima,</HI> and on the river Amazons <HI>cahuitahu,</HI> in imitation of its powerful cry, which Marcgrave denotes more preci&s;ely by <HI>Vyhu-vyhu,</HI> and which he repre&s;ents as &s;omething terrible.</NOTE> three or four inches long, and two or three lines in diameter at the ba&s;e: this horn, which is in&s;erted in the top of the forehead, ri&s;es &s;traight, and ter|minates in a &s;harp point bent &s;omewhat forward; near the ba&s;e it is &s;heathed like the quill of a feather.

Love binds their affections by an indi&s;&s;oluble chain: if one happens to die, the &s;urvivor can hardly &s;upport the lo&s;s of its companion; it wanders perpe|tually moaning, and con&s;umes the wretched remainder of its life near the &s;cenes of tender recollection and of pa&s;t joys &dagger;.</P>

<P>HAPPINESS is not equally be&s;towed on all &s;entient beings.

rapid &s;trides in the &s;ame path of inju&s;tice; and by the imperfection of the organs be|&s;towed on &s;ome of her creatures, &s;he has con|demned them to &s;truggle perpetually with mi&s;ery and want. Neglected children, &s;ent naked into the world, to live in continual penury; their toil&s;ome days are &s;pent in perpetual &s;olicitude, &s;ickened by the re&s;tle&s;s cravings of a fami&s;hed appetite: to &s;uffer and to endure, are often their only re&s;ources, and this inward pain traces its gha&s;tly im|pre&s;&s;ion on their external figure, and ob|literates all the graces which attend on feli|city. The Heron pre&s;ents to us the picture of wretchedne&s;s, anxiety, and indigence; and as it can procure its prey only by lying in ambu&s;h, it remains whole hours, whole days in the &s;ame &s;pot, and &s;o perfectly &s;till, as to di&s;cover no &s;igns of life. When ob|&s;erved by a tele&s;cope (for it can &s;eldom be approached) it appears benumbed, &s;eated on a &s;tone, its body almo&s;t erect, and re&s;t|ing on a &s;ingle foot; its neck folded back along its brea&s;t and belly, its head and bill &s;unk between its &s;houlders, which ri&s;e, and much over-top the brea&s;t. If it changes its po&s;ture to put it&s;elf in motion, it a&s;|&s;umes another, which is &s;till more con|&s;trained; it advances into the water to the height of its knee, and, holding its head between its legs, it watches the pa&s;&s;ing frog
<PB N="331" REF="367">
or fi&s;h. But as it mu&s;t wait the &s;pon|taneous occurrence of its prey, and has only a moment to make the &s;eizure, it is often con&s;trained to &s;uffer long fa&s;tings, and &s;ometimes to peri&s;h of ab&s;olute hunger: for when the waters are bound with ice, it has not the in&s;tinct to retire into milder climates. Some naturali&s;ts are mi&s;taken in ranking it among the birds of pa&s;&s;age <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agricola.</NOTE>; for here we &s;ee Herons at all &s;ea&s;ons, and even during the &s;evere&s;t and mo&s;t continued fro&s;ts.

when clo&s;ed, cover the tail; the height of the tar&s;us, and of the naked part of the thigh; the great length of the toes, of which the middle one has its nail in|dented, and the &s;ingular po&s;ition of the hind one, which is articulated at the &s;ide of the heel near the inner toe; la&s;tly, the naked greeni&s;h &s;kin which &s;preads from the bill to the eyes in them all. Their habits al&s;o are nearly the &s;ame; for they all haunt the mar&s;hes and margins of water; they are patient, &s;low in their motions, and have a melancholy deportment.</P>
<P>The peculiar features of the family of Herons, in which we include the Egrets, are, the neck exce&s;&s;ively long, very &s;lender, clothed below with pendant loo&s;e fea|thers; the body &s;trait, &s;hrunk, and, in mo&s;t &s;pecies, &s;et on tall &s;tilts.</P>

<P>AFTER the enumeration of all the He|rons and Crab-catchers, we &s;hall range a bird, which, though it does not belong to their family, is more nearly related to them than to any other.

<P>The appellation of &s;tary, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <HI>&s;tel|laris,</HI> given by the ancients to the Bittern, is derived&punc; according to Scaliger, from its evening flight, when it &s;oars aloft, and &s;eems to lo&s;e it&s;elf in the &s;tarry-vault: others a&s;&s;ert that the name refers to the &s;pots &s;cattered on its plumage.

The mo&s;t northern parts of America have al&s;o their &s;pecies of Bit|tern; and other &s;pecies occur in the &s;outh|ern regions.

when the cold becomes exce&s;&s;ive. Intel|ligent &s;port&s;men a&s;&s;ure us, that they never found it by the &s;ides of rivulets or near &s;prings in the inclement &s;ea&s;ons: and Wil|lughby &s;eems to regard its lofty flight after &s;un-&s;et in autumn, as its departure to warmer climates.</P>
<P>No ob&s;erver has given us fuller informa|tion on the &s;ubject of this bird than M. Baillon; and I &s;hall here give an extract of the account which he obligingly &s;ent to me.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The Bitterns are found almo&s;t every &s;ea&s;on of the year at Montreuil-&s;ur-Mer, and on the coa&s;ts of Picardy, though they are migratory.</Q> They are &s;een in great numbers in the month of December, and &s;ometimes dozens lurk in a &s;ingle tuft of reeds.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Few birds make &s;o cool a defence; it never attacks, but if once a&s;&s;ailed, it fights with intrepidity and temper.</Q> If darted upon by a bird of prey, it does not fly; it &s;tands erect and receives the &s;hock on the point of its bill, which is very &s;harp; and its wounded antagoni&s;t retreats &s;creaming. Old Buzzards never attack the Bittern, and the Common Falcons never &s;eize it, but by ru&s;hing upon it behind, while it is on
<PB N="402" REF="444">
the wing. It even makes re&s;i&s;tance when wounded by the &s;port&s;man; and in&s;tead of retiring, it waits his on&s;et, and gives &s;uch vigorous pu&s;hes with its bill as to pierce the leg through the boots; and many have in this way been &s;orely wounded. It mu&s;t be killed by blows, for it would contend till death.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Sometimes, though &s;eldom, the Bittern turns on its back like the rapacious birds, and fights both with its bill and its claws, which are very long.</Q> It throws it&s;elf into that po&s;ture, when &s;urprized by a dog.</P>
<P>The patience of this bird is equal to its courage; it remains whole hours, without &s;tirring, in the water concealed by the ru&s;hes: it watches the eels and frogs; and except in the love &s;ea&s;on, when it takes &s;ome excerci&s;e, it is as indolent and melancholy as the Stork. At other times, it cannot be di&s;covered but by dogs. During the months of February and March, the males utter, in the morning and evening, a cry, which may be compared to the explo&s;ion of a large mu&s;ket. The females run to the &s;ound, &s;ometimes a dozen round one male; for the Bitterns are, like the Ducks, poly|gamous: the males &s;trut among their mates, and drive off their rivals. They
<PB N="403" REF="445">
make their ne&s;ts almo&s;t clo&s;e on the water amid&s;t ru&s;hes, in the month of April: the incubation la&s;ts twenty-four or twenty-five days: the young ones are hatched naked, and of an un&s;ightly figure, for they &s;eem to be all neck and legs. They do not venture abroad until twenty days after their birth. The parents feed them fir&s;t with leeches, lizards, and frogs' &s;pawn, and afterwards with &s;mall eels. Their fea|thers are rufous at fir&s;t, as in the adults; their bill and legs rather white than green. The Buzzards, which plunder the ne&s;ts of mo&s;t of the Mar&s;h-birds, &s;eldom touch tho&s;e of the Bittern. The parents main|tain a con&s;tant guard and defence. Chil|dren dare not approach, for they &s;hould ri&s;k the lo&s;s of their eyes."</P>

<P>FOR the knowledge of this bird we are indebted to Adan&s;on, who found it at Senegal. It is rather larger than the Night Heron. It owes its name to the dun or umbre ca&s;t of its plumage. It ought to be regarded as an anomalous &s;pecies in the tribe of Mar&s;h-birds; for it belongs not exactly to any of them. It might be cla&s;&s;ed with the Herons, if its bill had not been of an entirely different form, and even peculiar to it&s;elf; being very broad and thick near the head, growing flatter at the &s;ides as it extends; the ridge of the upper mandible is prominent the whole length, and &s;eems to be detatched by two grooves that run on each &s;ide, which Bri&s;&s;on de&s;cribes, by &s;aying that the bill appears compo&s;ed of &s;everal jointed pieces: the ridge is reflected at the tip of the bill, and terminates in a curved point; the whole

The&s;e mea&s;ures were taken from one of the&s;e birds depo&s;ited in the king's cabinet. Bri&s;&s;on &s;eems to make them larger.

On the convexity of the upper mandible, there are two deep grooves, which are &s;ent off from the no&s;trils and produced, &s;o that the middle &s;pace makes a high ridge terminated by a &s;mall hooked point.

frame, whereon the &s;kin prolonged from the throat is extended. Both mandibles are &s;harp at the edges, and con&s;i&s;t of a &s;olid and very hard horn. The bill is four inches from the corners to its point, and its greate&s;t breadth twenty lines.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding its formidable weapon, the Savacou &s;eems to have a mild di&s;po&s;i|tion, and to lead a calm peaceful life, if we may judge from the names applied by nomenclators: the appellation <HI>Cancrofagus</HI> given by Barrere implies that it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts on crabs. But on the contrary, it removes from the &s;ea &s;hore, and haunts the deluged Savan|nas, or the &s;ides of rivers where the tide never a&s;cends <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations made at Cayenne by M.

<P>Barrere reckons three &s;pecies of the Sava|cou, which Bri&s;&s;on reduces to two, and which may probably be comprehended under one. In fact, the gray and the brown have no remarkable difference, except that the latter is furni&s;hed with a long tuft, which may be the character of the male. The other, which we conceive to be the female, has a trace of the &s;ame character in the feathers which hang from the back of the head. The difference between the colours of their plumage may be attributed to age or &s;ex; e&s;pecially as the <HI>Variegated Savacou</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brought from Cayenne by M.

Their forms and proportions, too, are preci&s;ely the &s;ame; and we are the more convinced that they con&s;titute but a &s;ingle &s;pecies, becau&s;e nature, though &s;he &s;ports with variety in the general plan of her works, leaves &s;ome &s;olitary and in&s;ulated produc|tions of peculiar &s;tructure on the confines of the grand divi&s;ions. The Avo&s;et, the
<PB N="429" REF="475">
Spoonbill, the Flamingo, &amp;c. are examples of this remark.</P>
<P>The Brown and Cre&s;ted Savacou, which we take to be the male, has more of the refous-gray than of the blui&s;h-gray, on its mantle. The feathers of the nape are black, and form a bunch of eight inches long, falling on the back: the&s;e feathers are float|ing, and &s;ome of them eight lines broad.</P>
<P>The Gray Savacou, which appears to be the female, has the whole of its mantle of a blui&s;h light gray, with a &s;mall black zone on the top of the back; the under|&s;ide of the body is black, mixed with rufous; the forepart of the neck and the front, are white; the head-dre&s;s falls back into a point, and is of a blui&s;h black.</P>
<P>In both, the throat is naked; the &s;kin which covers it, &s;eems capable of a con&s;i|derable dilatation: and this is probably what Barre means by the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>ingluvie extuberante.</HI> This &s;kin, according to Marc|grave, is yellowi&s;h, as well as the legs; the toes are &s;lender, and the <HI>phalanges</HI> long. We may al&s;o remark, that the hind-toe is arti|culated with the &s;ide of the heel, near the outer toe, as in the Herons. The tail is &s;hort, and does not project beyond the wing. The total length of the bird is

But the &s;pecies is no where numerous: at Cayenne, for in&s;tance, there are perhaps &s;ix times more Curlews than Spoon-bills, and their greate&s;t flocks never exceed eight or nine at mo&s;t, commonly only two or three, and often the&s;e are accompanied by Flamingoes. In the morning and evening, the Spoon-bills are &s;een on the Sea-&s;hore, or &s;itting on trunks that float near the beach; but about the middle of the day in the &s;ultrie&s;t wea|ther they enter the creeks, and perch very high on the aquatic trees. Yet they are
<PB N="440" REF="487">
not very wild; for at &s;ea they pa&s;s very near the canoes, and on land they &s;uffer a per&s;on to get within gun-&s;hot of them, whether they be alighted or on the wing. Their beautiful plumage is often &s;oiled by the mud, in which they wade deep in que&s;t of prey. M. De la Borde, who made the&s;e ob&s;ervations on their oeconomy, confirms M. Barrere's account of their colour, and a&s;&s;ures us that the Spoon-bills of Guiana do not a&s;&s;ume, until about their third year, that beautiful red tint, and that the young ones are almo&s;t entirely white.</P>
<P>M. Baillon, to whom we are indebted for many good ob&s;ervations, admits two &s;pe|cies of Spoon-bills, and informs me, by letter, that both the&s;e appear on the coa&s;ts of Picardy, in the months of November and April, but that neither of them remains: they &s;top a day or two near the &s;ea, and the adjacent mar&s;hes; they are few in number, and &s;eem extremely &s;hy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the Common Spoon-bill, which is of a very bright white and has no cre&s;t: the &s;econd &s;pecies is cre&s;ted, and &s;maller than the other. M. Baillon thinks that the&s;e differences, with &s;ome varieties in the colours of the bill and plumage, are &s;ufficient to con&s;titute two di&s;tinct and independent &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="488">
He is al&s;o per&s;uaded, that all the Spoon|bills are hatched gray like the Egrets, which they re&s;emble in the &s;hape of their body, in their manner of flying, and in their other habits: he regards tho&s;e of St. Domingo as forming a third &s;pecies. But it appears to us from the rea&s;ons already advanced, that the&s;e are only three varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies, &s;ince they have all the &s;ame in&s;tincts and habits.</P>
<P>M. Baillon ob&s;erved in five Spoon-bills, which he was at the pains to di&s;&s;ect, that all of them had their &s;tomach filled with &s;hrimps, &s;mall fi&s;h, and water in&s;ects; and, as their tongue is almo&s;t nothing, and their bill neither &s;harp nor indented, it would &s;eem that they cannot catch eels, or any fi&s;h that make re&s;i&s;tance, and that they live on very &s;mall animals, which obliges them to &s;earch continually for their food.</P>
<P>It is probable that the&s;e birds in certain circum&s;tances make the &s;ame clattering with their bill as the Storks; for M. Baillon, having wounded one, ob&s;erved that it made that noi&s;e, which was produced by the quick and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive motion of the mandi|bles, though the bill was &s;o weak that it could hardly &s;queeze the finger. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Ro&s;eate or Scarlet Spoon-bill <HI>Platalea-Ajai:</HI> "Its body is blood coloured."</NOTE></P>

<P>The Woodcocks arrive in the night, and &s;ometimes during the day, in cloudy weather <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>, always one by one, or two together, but never in flocks. They alight among large hedge-rows, cop&s;es, and tall clumps, and prefer tho&s;e woods which abound with loo&s;e mould and fallen leaves. They lie concealed the whole day, and lurk &s;o clo&s;e that it requires-a dog to put them
<PB N="444" REF="492">
up, and they often &s;pring at the &s;port&s;man's feet. They leave their dark leafy retreats on the approach of evening, and &s;pread among the glades, keeping always the little paths. They &s;eek the &s;oft and wet pa&s;turage by the &s;kirts of the wood, and the &s;mall meres, where they wa&s;h their bill and feet, which are daubed with earth in &s;earching for their food. They have all the &s;ame oeconomy; and we might &s;ay in general, that the Woodcocks are birds void of character, and that the habits of the individual re&s;ult entirely from tho&s;e of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The Woodcock makes a noi&s;y flapping with its wings when it ri&s;es. In tall groves it &s;hoots pretty &s;traight along, but in cop&s;es it is often obliged to deflect its cour&s;e, and dives behind the bu&s;hes to conceal it&s;elf from the fowler <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. Its flight, though rapid, is neither high, nor long &s;upported. It &s;tops with &s;uch promptne&s;s, as to fall apparently like a dead weight. A few moments after it drops, it runs &s;wiftly; but &s;oon &s;tops, rai&s;es its head, and ca&s;ts a glance all round, before it ventures to lurk in the herbage. Pliny ju&s;tly com|pares the Woodcock to the Partridge in
<PB N="445" REF="493">
regard to the celerity with which it runs <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ru&s;ticula &amp; perdices currunt.</HI> Plin.</NOTE> for it conceals it&s;elf in the &s;ame way, and before the &s;port&s;man reaches the &s;pot where he perceives it to alight, he finds that it has already tripped to a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>It appears that this bird, though it has large eyes, does not &s;ee well but in twilight, and cannot &s;upport a &s;trong light. This &s;eems to be evinced by its manner of life, and by its motions, which are never &s;o agile as in the dawn, or at the clo&s;e of the day. And &s;o &s;trong is this propen|&s;ity to action at the ri&s;e or de&s;cent of the &s;un, that Woodcocks kept in a room have been ob&s;erved to flutter regularly every morning and evening; while during the day or the night, they only tripped on the floor, without attempting to fly. And pro|bably the wild Woodcocks remain &s;till in dark nights; but in moon-light they come abroad in que&s;t of food. Hence the &s;port&s;|men call the full moon of November, <HI>the Woodcock's moon (lune des beca&s;&s;es)</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In England, it is u&s;ually termed <HI>the hunter's moon.</HI> T.</NOTE>, becau&s;e they are then caught in the greate&s;t num|bers.

They may al&s;o be &s;hot in the meres, or on the brooks and fords at &s;un|&s;et: the fowler fits in a clo&s;e arbour near the &s;pot which the Woodcocks frequent; and a little after the clo&s;e of day, e&s;pecially when the mild &s;outh or &s;outh-we&s;t winds blow, they generally arrive, one or two together, and alight on the water, where they may be fired at, with almo&s;t certain &s;ucce&s;s. Yet this &s;port is le&s;s profitable and more precarious than that practi&s;ed by &s;prings &s;et in their paths. The&s;e are &s;witches of hazel, or other flexible and ela&s;tic wood, driven into the ground, and tied down to a trap that encircles a noo&s;e of hair or pack-thread: the re&s;t of the path is inclo&s;ed with boughs; or if the &s;pring be planted on pa&s;ture-ground, brooms or junipers are &s;tuck in rows, &s;o as to leave only a &s;mall pa&s;&s;age. The bird advances in the track, and being aver&s;e to leap or fly, it bru&s;hes on the trap, which &s;tarting, it is &s;eized in the noo&s;e and lifted into the air by the recoil of the &s;witch. The Woodcock thus &s;u&s;pended &s;truggles much, and the &s;port&s;man mu&s;t make more

than one progre&s;s among his &s;nares in the evening, and &s;till more towards the end of the night, el&s;e the fox, a more diligent hunter, informed by the flapping of their wings, will pay a vi&s;it, and carry them off one after another, and, without taking time to eat them, will conceal them in different places, to be devoured at lei&s;ure. The haunts of this bird may be di&s;covered by its excrements, which are large, white, and inodorous. To invite it into pa&s;tures where there are no paths, furrows are traced, which it follows in &s;earch of the worms that are turned up, and it is entangled in the gins or hair-noo&s;es placed in the line.</P>

<HEAD>The SAVANNA WOODCOCK. <HI>Scolopax Paludo&s;ae.</HI> Gmel.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Woodcock of Guiana, though one fourth &s;maller than that of France, has a &s;till longer bill; it is al&s;o rather taller: its legs and bill are brown; light gray inter&s;ected and variegated with bars of black, predominates in its plumage, which is le&s;s mixed with rufous than in our Woodcock. With the&s;e exterior differ|ences, which the climate has perhaps occa|&s;ioned, tho&s;e of its oeconomy and habits, which it al&s;o produces, may be traced, in the Savanna Woodcock: it dwells con&s;tantly in tho&s;e immen&s;e natural meadows where it is never mole&s;ted by men or dogs; it lodges in the bottoms where the mud is collected, and where the herbs are thick and tall; avoiding however tho&s;e &s;hallows where the tide ri&s;es, and makes the water brack|i&s;h. In the rainy &s;ea&s;on, the&s;e Little Wood|cocks
<PB N="461" REF="509">
remove to the uplands, and lodge among the gra&s;s: at this time they pair and ne&s;tle on the gentle elevations in holes lined with dry herbs. They lay only two eggs; but they have a &s;econd hatch, and in July, after the rains are over, they again de&s;cend into the bottom grounds, &s;hifting their re&s;idence from the heights to the vallies the &s;ame way as tho&s;e of Europe. When the Savannas are &s;et on fire, which is often done in September and October, they e&s;cape in great numbers into the cir|cumjacent tracts, but &s;eem to avoid the woods, and when pur&s;ued they never halt, or endeavour to regain their ancient &s;ite; which is contrary to the habits of the European Woodcock. Yet they &s;pring, like the latter, always under the &s;port&s;|man's feet; they make the &s;ame effort in ri&s;ing, have the &s;ame noi&s;y flight, and di&s;|charge their excrement, too, in commenc|ing their motion. If one is &s;hot, it does not e&s;cape to a di&s;tance, but wheels round until it drops. They are generally flu&s;hed two and two, &s;ometimes three together; and when we &s;ee one we may be &s;ure that the other is not far off.

<P>IN the French and German languages the name of the Snipe is the diminutive of the appellation given to the Woodcock; and upon viewing its figure, we &s;hould naturally take it for a &s;mall &s;pecies of that bird: <HI>It would be a little Woodcock,</HI> &s;ays Belon, <HI>were its habits not different.</HI> It has a very long bill, and a &s;quare head; its plumage is al&s;o &s;peckled the &s;ame, except that the rufous is le&s;s intermingled, and that the light gray and the black predominate. But its re&s;emblance to the Woodcock is con|fined to externals only, and its natural
<PB N="464" REF="513">
habits are oppo&s;ite. It never frequents the woods; it lives in wet meadows, or among the herbs and oziers which edge the brinks of &s;treams. It &s;oars to &s;uch height as to e&s;cape from view, though its cry is &s;till heard; this is a feeble note like the bleat of a goat, <HI>m&eacute;e, m&eacute;e m&eacute;e,</HI> which has induced &s;ome nomenclators to term it the <HI>Flying|goat</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Klein, Schwenckfeld, Rzaczyn&s;ki.</NOTE>: it al&s;o vents a &s;hort weak whi&s;tle in taking wing. It differs from the Wood|cock as much, therefore, in its di&s;po&s;itions and habits, as it re&s;embles that bird in its plumage and figure.</P>
<P>In France, the Snipes appear in autumn; they are &s;een &s;ometimes three or four toge|ther, but oftene&s;t &s;ingly. They are flu&s;hed at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and fly very nimbly; and after three turnings, they &s;hoot onwards two or three hundred paces, or tower aloft out of &s;ight. The &s;port&s;|man can bend their cour&s;e and lead them near him by imitating their voice. They continue the whole winter in our pro|vinces, near the unfrozen fountains and the &s;mall contiguous bogs; they retire in great numbers in &s;pring, which al&s;o appears to be the &s;ea&s;on of their arrival in many countries where they breed; as in Ger|many <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>,
<PB N="465" REF="514">
in Sile&s;ia <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE> and in Switzerland <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>. But in France, a few Snipes remain the whole &s;ummer, and ne&s;tle in our mar&s;hes: Willughby makes the &s;ame remark with regard to England, they build in June, on the ground, beneath &s;ome large root of alder or willow, in mora&s;&s;es where the cat|tle cannot reach: their ne&s;t is compo&s;ed of dry herbs and feathers, and contains four or five oblong eggs, of a whiti&s;h colour, with ru&s;tly &s;pots. The young ones leave their man&s;ion, as &s;oon as they bur&s;t from the &s;hell; they appear ugly and &s;hapele&s;s: the mother neverthele&s;s is affectionate to them, and never de&s;erts them till their long bill is firm enough to enable them to pro|cure ea&s;ily their food.</P>
<P>The Snipe continually nibbles in the ground, though we can hardly &s;ay what it eats: nothing is found in its &s;tomach but an earthy &s;ediment and a watery liquor, which is probably the di&s;&s;olved &s;ub&s;tance of the worms on which it feeds; for Aldro|vandus remarks that its tongue is termi|nated as in the Woodpeckers by a &s;harp point, proper for piercing the worms which it digs out of the mud.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="515">
The head of the Snipe has a horizontal balancing, and the tail a motion upwards and downwards; it walks lei&s;urely, its head erect, without hopping or flickering: but &s;eldom is it &s;urprized in that &s;tate; for it carefully conceals it&s;elf among the ru&s;hes and herbage of &s;limy bogs, where the fowl|ers cannot approach, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;ort of rackets made of light deal, &s;o broad as not to &s;ink in the mud. And as the Snipe &s;prings at a di&s;tance, with great rapidity, and makes &s;everal inflexions be|fore it &s;pins along its cour&s;e; it is one of the mo&s;t difficult birds to &s;hoot. It may be caught ea&s;ier with a &s;pringe, &s;imilar to what is &s;et in paths for the Woodcock.</P>

probable, that at other times, they pa&s;s unob&s;erved, intermingled perhaps with the Du&s;ky Sandpipers, or the Hor&s;emen, to which they bear great analogy.</P>
<P>The Ruffs and Reeves are nearly the &s;tature of the Red-&s;hanks, though their legs are not quite &s;o tall; the bill has the &s;ame form, but &s;horter. The females are com|monly &s;maller than the males <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rzaczyn&s;ki.</NOTE>, and re&s;em|ble them in their plumage, which is white with a mixture of brown on the upper &s;urface. But the males in the &s;pring are &s;o different from one another, that each might be taken for a bird of a di&s;tinct &s;pecies: of more than a hundred, compared by Klein at the hou&s;e of the governor of Scania, there were only two preci&s;ely &s;imi|lar; they varied either in &s;hape or in the bulk of their &s;welled ruff round the neck. The feathers which compo&s;e that bunch appear in the beginning of the &s;pring, and remain only during the &s;ea&s;on of love. But be&s;ides the exuberance of growth at that time, the &s;uperabundance of organic mole|cules di&s;plays it&s;elf al&s;o in the eruption of fle&s;hy turgid pimples on the fore&s;ide of the head and round the eyes <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus, <HI>Fauna Sueciea.</HI></NOTE>. This double pro|duction
<PB N="501" REF="553">
implies great prolific powers in the Ruffs. "I know of no bird, M. Bail|lon writes us, in which the appetite of love is more ardent; none who&s;e te&s;ticles are &s;o large in proportion, each being near &s;ix lines in diameter, and an inch or more in length; the other organs of gene|ration are equally dilated in the &s;ea&s;on of its amours. We may judge of the impe|tuo&s;ity of their ho&s;tile a&s;&s;aults, from the &s;trength of that pa&s;&s;ion which blows up the fires of jealou&s;y and rival&s;hip. I have often followed the&s;e birds in our mar&s;hes (in Lower Picardy) where they arrive in the month of April with the Hor&s;emen, but in &s;maller numbers.

The van|qui&s;hed betakes him&s;elf to flight, but the cry of the fir&s;t female which he hears, di&s;pels his fears and awakens his courage; and he again renews the conflict, if another oppo|nent appears. The&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes are repeated every morning or evening until the depar|ture of the birds, which happens &s;ometime in May; for only a few &s;tragglers remain, and their ne&s;ts are never found in our mar&s;hes."</P>

With this view one of the di&s;ciples of Linnaeus con|&s;tructed, at Up&s;al in Sweden, what he terms a <HI>Calendar of Flora.</HI> We have &s;e|lected from it the circum&s;tances relating to birds, and have joined the ob&s;ervations made at Stratton in Norfolk, by Mr. Stil|ling fleet. Up&s;al is in latitude 598 51&prime;, Stratton in 52&deg; 45&prime;.</P>
