<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE great &s;ervice you have done this comedy, by your admirable per|formance in it, obliges the author to return you his publick thanks; he does &s;o mo&s;t &s;incerely; and, at the &s;ame time, begs leave to in&s;cribe it to you, as you have certainly the be&s;t right to what you have made.</P>
<P>It is not the fir&s;t time, indeed, that the writer of this piece has been in|debted to the abilities of Mrs. Abing|ton: tho&s;e per&s;ons who remember her in the Hypocrite, (and &s;uch as have &s;een that play, I think, cannot have ea&s;ily forgot her) mu&s;t allow, that &s;he made a no le&s;s &s;triking figure in Charlotte, (the elegant, and &s;prightly Maria of the Nonjuror) than &s;he now does, in the flaunting, flippant, noi&s;y chambermaid.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
But, while I am endeavouring to acknowledge my obligations to you, let not my complai&s;ance for a lady, make me overlook a friend to whom I am equally bound; I mean Mr. King: who, by all accounts, has &s;upported the character of Mu&s;kato in a manner even to force applau&s;e from enemies.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could devi&s;e a better me|thod than I here take to expre&s;s my gratitude to you both; my prai&s;es can add nothing to your reputation, nor to his: however, I &s;hall have a le&s;s mean opinion of my writings, than I otherwi&s;e would, while they afford either of you an opportunity of in&s;pir|ing the public, with fre&s;h admiration of your talents.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN this Comedy was put into Mr. Garrick's hands, it was delivered to him as a piece, the chief merit of which con&s;i&s;ted in the Intrigue; and, as &s;uch, he agreed with the Author, that it was a very great curio&s;ity. It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, in ju&s;tice to his di&s;cernment, that he thought the exhibition of it a hazardous attempt; however, he at the &s;ame time declared, that if the Play did not too far cla&s;h with the prejudices of $re|vailing ta&s;te, he thought it had an undou$$ed right to &s;ucce&s;s. On what ground the writer founded his hopes, that the&s;e prejudices would not be unrea&s;onably urged again&s;t it; or, if they were, that his Comedy would in the end get the better of them; a &s;hort account of the piece from whence he took it, will pro|bably be the be&s;t explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
THE original of the Play, now laid before the public, is called <HI>El E&s;condido y la Tapada, The Hidden Man and the Veil'd Woman;</HI> and is counted the ma&s;ter-piece of the mo&s;t famous among the Spani&s;h Dramatic Poets, Don Pedro Calderon de la Barca; who, through Moliere, Corneille, Le Sage, Boi&s;&s;y, &amp;c. has provided Vanbrugh, Centlivre, Cibber, and Steel, with The Mi&s;take, The Fal&s;e Friend, The Wonder, The Bu&s;y Body, The Kind Impo&s;tor, The Lady's Philo&s;ophy, and The Lying Lover, all Engli&s;h Comedies, which have been received upon the &s;tage with the warme&s;t marks of approbation.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, neither the&s;e former in&s;tances of Calderon's favourable reception among us, nor the forcible manner in which the writer was &s;truck, when he fir&s;t peru&s;ed this parti|cular Comedy of his, were the &s;ole motives that induced him to adopt it. In a little French book, called <HI>Hi&s;toire des F&ecirc;tes Gallantes des Rois de France,</HI> he found it prai&s;ed as a miracle of invention and dramatic &s;ituations; and that in the year 1668 it was one of the plays that had been performed during the famous fea&s;t at Ver&s;ailles, given by Louis XIV. to his court, and a va&s;t concour&s;e of the fir&s;t people in Europe. In another book, where it is mentioned, he found that in November 1716 it was again put into French, and acted under the title of <HI>L'Amant Cach&egrave; &amp; la Dame Voil&eacute;e,</HI> fir&s;t at the ca&s;tle of the celebrated
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
<HI>Mare&s;chal Noailles,</HI> in honour of his daughter's marriage with Prince Charles; and afterwards by the comedians in Paris, (to whom the Mare&s;chal made it a pre&s;ent) with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. La&s;tly, in the year 1769, it was once more tran&s;lated into the French language, by <HI>Mon&s;. Lanquit,</HI> a Coun&s;ellor of Parliament, and an excellent writer and critic; who, after much prai&s;e of the poet and the piece, (which he names <HI>La Cloi&s;on, The Pannel)</HI> &s;peaking of Don Carlos and Mu&s;kato, being locked up in the unfurni&s;hed hou&s;e, he &s;ays, <Q>&startq;it is an incident the mo&s;t theatrical that can be imagined, and nothing is &s;o inere&s;ting and &s;o &s;ingular as the &s;ituations it produces.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall perhaps be told, that the&s;e te&s;|timonies in favour of the Original may &s;till leave the Copy without excu&s;e; and as I be|lieve they who di&s;like the Play will hardly take my word, when I tell them I have done it no harm, I mu&s;t refer them to the Spani&s;h original, or the French tran&s;lation, (which is literal) to enable them to decide the point. I &s;hall only add, in this place, that the critics have long agreed to make a di&s;tinction be|tween Comedies of Character and Comedies of Intrigue; and notwith&s;tanding the&s;e are undoubtedly the be&s;t, which are compo&s;ed of a due portion of both, I never under&s;tood, from all I have read about the matter, that Comedy forfeited her name by attaching her|&s;elf to either, particularly the latter; in which
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
the great difficulty of the dramatic art &s;eems to lie. Nor can I find, tho' it has been of late years the fa&s;hion for Comedy to addre&s;s her&s;elf rather to the Heart and Under&s;tanding <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ort of Comedy, if plea&s;antry be not intirely excluded, is certainly the mo&s;t commendable of all; and the Author begs leave to ob&s;erve, that the Maid of the Mill, a piece written by him&s;elf, however trifling in other circum&s;tances, was the fir&s;t &s;entimental Drama that had appeared on the Engli&s;h &s;tage for near forty years.</NOTE>, than the Fancy, that &s;he may not addre&s;s her|&s;elf to the Fancy &s;olely, (as in this piece) without calling her title at all in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>THESE propo&s;itions agreed to, I hope I &s;hall be pardoned for thinking that a reader, or &s;pectator, not violently exceptious, who will &s;it down with a hearty de&s;ire to be amu&s;ed, may find great entertainment from Calderon's Play. Nay, even the profe&s;&s;ed critic will meet &s;omething not to be di&s;plea&s;ed with, particularly in the Plot; in which is pre&s;erved a perfect unity of action, at the &s;ame time that it is branched into a multitude of incidents. The&s;e incidents, again, are all naturally prepared; ri&s;ing one from the other, without confu&s;ion, without ob&s;curity; and with le&s;s to excu&s;e, on the plea of nece&s;&s;ity, (a plea which in &s;ome ca&s;es a judicious critic will always be ready to admit) than could be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, in &s;uch a ti&s;&s;ue of events, drawn from a &s;imple circum&s;tance. Nor, let me &s;ay, will a candid judge, who knows how
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
to rate the merit of invention, be very apt to quarrel with &s;uch a Play, for a weak Scene, or unguarded Phra&s;e; or for wanting, what in its nature it cannot have, laboured Dialogue, and high wrought Character.</P>
<P>To the performers in this Comedy, the Engli&s;h Author, or Tran&s;lator, which ever he may be called, has great obligations; particularly to Mr. Reddi&s;h, who, in the character of Don Carlos, accepted of a part, purely to &s;erve him, greatly below his merit; though his &s;pirited action gives it con&s;equence in the repre&s;entation. To Mr. Par&s;ons, Mr. Brereton, and Mr. Baddely, he is al&s;o very much obliged.</P>
<P>To Mr. Garrick he is indebted for&mdash;every thing; but, as they were given in a moment of nece&s;&s;ity and di&s;appointment, he mu&s;t par|ticularly thank him for his Prologue and Epilogue; the value of the gift being in no &s;ort le&s;&s;ened to the receiver, by the &s;hort time taken to produce them.</P>

In a word, it is this intel|ligence that has brought me here to Madrid. It is a duty I owe both to you, and my&s;elf, to find out the truth of the&s;e reports; and, if they prove au|thentic, it will be my duty, to take &s;uch mea&s;ures, as may prevent your running into the like di&s;orders for the future.</P>

<P>Your air &s;peaks a mind in agitation; what's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>You came to-day to my uncle's, to a&s;k about the melancholy affair, in which my cou&s;in, Don Alonzo, was killed by Don Carlos de Pimentel; I then told you all I knew of the matter, and that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in had e&s;caped to Portugal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>About an hour ago, my cou&s;in Marcella and her maid, were overturned in a coach, ju&s;t by my uncle's hou&s;e; going out to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we met two men, who endeavoured to &s;hun us; coming back, we cro&s;&s;ed them again; and, by the light of the flambeaux, which fell directly on their faces, I &s;aw and knew one of them to be Don Carlos. I immediately gave a &s;ervant the word, and he has dogged him, and his man, to a little inn, where they put up two mules, they had with them; and on which, they appeared to be ju&s;t come off a journey.</P>

<P>You are po&s;itive you &s;aw Don Carlos?</P>

<P>I am as po&s;itive it was he, as that I this moment &s;ee you.&mdash;Now, as I am &s;hortly to be married to my cou&s;in, it is highly incumbent upon me to render my&s;elf acceptable to my uncle; and, I am certain, I can do nothing more likely to plea&s;e him, than taking vengeance on the man who kill'd his &s;on. I therefore expect that you will lend me

your a&s;&s;i&s;tance upon &s;o intere&s;ting an occa&s;ion, and accompany me to the place where the &s;ervant is ready to lead us: either to &s;ee that I have no foul play done me in an a&s;&s;ault; or to help me to &s;eize the delinquent, and give him over to the officers of ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>Why &s;o?&mdash;The accident of my brother's coming, may, for &s;ome time, put you in a di&s;agree|able &s;ituation, but not in a de&s;perate one; I have prepared a retreat for you, where his utmo&s;t cunning will never be able to find you.</P>

<P>This hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts, like many others in Madrid, but of two &s;tories: the upper, I occupy my&s;elf; the lower, which, on my father's death, I found I had no occa&s;ion for, I let to one Octavio, a wine-merchant: on this divi&s;ion of the building, a back &s;tair-ca&s;e, which made the communication between the two &s;tories, with a &s;mall clo&s;et adjoin|ing, became u&s;ele&s;s; and, by mutual con&s;ent, was &s;topped up, by a partition on the &s;ide of the apart|ment below, as well as on this. When I had thoughts of bringing you back to Madrid, it occurred to me, that the partition on my &s;ide might again be &s;ecretly opened, and prepared in &s;uch a manner, as would effectually &s;creen you from any &s;earch, &s;hould it ever be &s;u&s;pected that you were in the hou&s;e: ac|cordingly, the thing is done, <STAGE>(going to the back &s;cene, &s;he lifts up a pannel, which di&s;covers the head of a &s;tair-ca&s;e)</STAGE> and this moveable pannel, will, when you plea&s;e, admit you into a place of &s;ecurity; and, when fa&s;tened on the in&s;ide&mdash;</P>

<P>Excu&s;e me, Ma'am, I have too grateful a &s;en&s;e of your kindne&s;s, to avail my&s;elf of a retreat, which mu&s;t expo&s;e you. In this emergency, the mo&s;t &s;imple way is to return to the place from whence I came.</P>

In my opinion, indeed, you ought to take every thing belonging to you out of the&s;e apartments directly; for, depend upon it, as &s;oon as an order can be procured from court, the officers of the police will be here; and, find who or what they will, they'll &s;eize all without mercy.</P>

<HEAD>ACT IV. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Chamber in <HI>Don Guzman's</HI> hou&s;e: <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> enters with a letter, followed by <HI>Lazarillo.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND pray, Sir, who gave you this letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, nobody gave it to me; that is to &s;ay, what you can properly call gave; but ju&s;t now while you were abroad, and I was bru&s;hing your cloaths yonder in the gallery, Mrs. Beatrice bolted out of her lady's chamber; there, &s;ays &s;he, there's a letter for your &s;weet ma&s;ter; 'tis from Donna Marcella, give it him: and with that, Sir, throwing to me, or rather flinging at me, the paper you now hold in your hand, &s;he turn'd upon her heel, and &s;hut the door with a clap, that made the hou&s;e &s;hake again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me read it once more, that I may be &s;ure I clearly under&s;tand her meaning. <Q>&startq;Tho' I am &s;atisfied there are &s;ome in&s;tances of ill behaviour in your &s;ex, which the delicacy of ours hardly permits us to take notice of; I cannot help telling you, that your bringing an ill woman into my father's hou&s;e la&s;t night, is a proceeding of that mon&s;trous nature, as is neither to be defended, or forgiven. What, while you was under a contract of marriage with his daughter; when the mo&s;t &s;acred promi&s;e of la&s;ting fidelity! was ready to part from your lips: but I will not animadvert on an action, I cannot think of without horror; I &s;hall only inform you, that there is an end of any farther connection between you and me.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>And &s;o &s;he concludes, your humble &s;ervant Marcella de Ribbera?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever hear the like of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, I can't charge my memory exactly; but for the meaning of the letter, I think it pretty plain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="80">
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>D'ye?&mdash;Now to me it is utterly inexpli|cable: was there a woman in the hou&s;e la&s;t night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, the &s;ervants &s;ay &s;o:&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e after Donna Marcella&mdash;and from the reports of Mrs. Beatrice&mdash;for my own part, I neither &s;aw man nor woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>A man there was, by all that's &s;acred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir, I don't pretend to contradict you; but how did he contrive to &s;lip away from us then? The centinels were po&s;ted at the door before you came in; and as the family was awake, and &s;tirring about, I think it hardly po&s;&s;ible for him to have got from the chambers to the &s;treet, without meeting &s;ome one or other of us in his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>The po&s;&s;ibility of the thing is clear, by it's having happened. No doubt, a lucky moment favoured his e&s;cape; and though the centinels &s;ay nobody pa&s;&s;ed, he might, before they were ap|prized, have gone out unnoticed by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that's true too, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, at any rate, Lazarillo, I am by no means &s;orry this affair has happened; on the con|trary, it lets me into &s;ome circum&s;tances relative to Donna Marcella's turn of mind, which it is my in|tere&s;t to be acquainted w$th; and I am glad to come to a knowledge of them before it is too late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, and &s;o you ought. Ah! Sir, it is not always your faces full of &s;miles, and dimples, that cover the kinde&s;t hearts, or the be&s;t natures; and between our&s;elves, I have long &s;u&s;pected, that Donna Marcella conceal'd more under hers, than &s;he cho&s;e to let appear for the pre&s;ent. A tyger's a tyger, Sir, for all it's pretty &s;potted &s;kin; and the likene&s;s between the bea&s;t, and the Chri&s;tian, lies in this: as in the animal, a fair out&s;ide is the wrapper, or &s;urtout, to a damn'd, growling, fierce di&s;po&s;ition; &s;o a lady, though &s;he has a face like an angel, may have a temper wor&s;e than a devil.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there, to be &s;ure, Sir, you wou'd have had an advantage: and after all, if there is to be an accu&s;ation trump'd up on either &s;ide, have not you as good a right to que&s;tion Donna Marcella about the man, as &s;he has to call you to an account about the woman?</P>

I writ him a candid account of my rencounter with the Duke, to whom he immediately went; and he managed matters &s;o well, that ju&s;t now he came to the place of my retreat with the me&s;&s;age I have repeated to you: that his Grace took the blame of the whole affair upon him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;ured me, upon his honour, he would not &s;uffer me in any way to be troubled or mole&s;ted about it.</P>
</SP>

<P>It &s;peaks the genero&s;ity which always ought to di&s;tingui&s;h the nobleman.

<P>What you tell me is very odd; however that is not a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for my doubting the truth of it.

<P>Con&s;cious of the indelicacy, I will quit it immediately. Nay more, I will for &s;ome months, or longer if you plea&s;e, return to my exile at Li&s;bon; yet let me hope, that time may open a way to our re-union, at lea&s;t &s;o far&mdash;</P>

<P>Nobody can give a better account of that matter than I; and whenever Don Guzman permits me, I will do my&s;elf the honour to wait upon him, and entertain him with our whole adventure. In the mean time, to the very ground I thank him for all favours; wi&s;hing him health, happine&s;s, and long life.&mdash;Of you al&s;o, young gentleman and lady, I take my leave:&mdash;and of you, Mrs. Beatrice, whom I will attend, within this week, to the mercer's, for a new &s;ilk gown; though I am oblig'd to pay for it out of my wages.&mdash;And, la&s;tly, my dear ma&s;ter. I wi&s;h you joy, from the bottom of my heart, of being relea&s;ed from all your troubles, by the gene|ro&s;ity of this good old gentleman: his be$aviour has been that of a noble Spaniard; and I hope our friends will te&s;tify their &s;atisfaction, by joining to applaud it.</P>
