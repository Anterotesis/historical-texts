<HEAD>To His Grace the Duke of <HI>QUEENSBERRY</HI> and <HI>DOVER</HI>, Marquis of <HI>BEVERLY,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have long lain under the greate&s;t Obligations to Your Grace's Family, and nothing has been more in my Wi&s;hes, than that I might be able to di&s;charge &s;ome part, at lea&s;t, of &s;o large a Debt. But Your Noble Birth and Fortune, the Power, Num|ber and Goodne&s;s of tho&s;e Friends You have already, have plac'd You in &s;uch an Independency on the re&s;t of the World, that the Services I am able to render to Your Grace can never be advan|tageous, I am &s;ure, not nece&s;&s;ary to You in any Part of Your Life. However, the next Piece of Gratitude, and the only one I am capa|ble of, is the Acknowledgment of what I owe: And as this is the mo&s;t publick, and indeed the only way I have of doing it, Your Grace will pardon me if I take this Opportunity to let the World know the Duty and Honour I had for your illu&s;trious Father. It is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, a very tender Point to touch upon; and at the fir&s;t fight may &s;eem an ill cho&s;en Compliment, to renew the Memory of &s;uch a Lo&s;s, e&s;pecially to a Di&s;po&s;ition &s;o &s;weet and gentle, and to a Heart &s;o &s;en&s;ible of filial Piety as Your Grace's has been, even from Your earlie&s;t Childhood. But perhaps this is one of tho&s;e Griefs by which the Heart may be made better; and if the Remem|brance of his Death bring Heavine&s;s along with it, the Honour that is paid to his Memory by all good Men, &s;hall wipe away tho&s;e Tears, and the Example of his Life &s;et before Your Eyes, &s;hall be of the greate&s;t Advantage to Your Grace in the Conduct and future Di&s;po&s;ition of Your Own.</P>
<P>In a Character &s;o amiable as that of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Queensberry</HI> was, there can be no Part &s;o proper to begin with as that, which was in him, and is in all good Men, the Foundation of all other Vertues, either Religious or Civil, I mean good Nature. Good Nature, which is Friend&s;hip between Man and Man, good Breeding in Courts, Charity in Religion, and the true Spring of all Beneficence in ge|neral. This was a Quality he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in as great a Mea&s;ure as any Gentleman I ever had the Honour to know. It was this natu|ral
<PB REF="3">
Sweetne&s;s of Temper, which made him the be&s;t Man in the World to live with, in any kind of Relation. It was this, made him a good Ma&s;ter to his Servants, a good Friend to his Friends, and the ten|dere&s;t Father to his Children. For the la&s;t, I can have no better Voucher than your Grace; and for the re&s;t I may appeal to all that have had the Honour to know him. There was a Spirit and Plea&s;ure in his Conver&s;ation, which always enliven'd the Company he was in, which, together with a certain Ea&s;ine&s;s and Frankne&s;s in his Di&s;|po&s;ition, that did not at all derogate from the Dignity of his Birth and Character, render'd him infinitely agreeable. And as no Man had a more delicate ta&s;te of natural Wit, his Conver&s;ations always abounded in good Humour.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e Parts of his Character which related to the Publick, as he was a Nobleman of the fir&s;t Rank, and a Mini&s;ter of State, they will be be&s;t known by the great Employments he pa&s;t through; all which he di&s;charg'd worthily as to him&s;elf, ju&s;tly to the Princes who employ'd him, and advantageou&s;ly for his Country. There is no occa|&s;ion to enumerate his &s;everal Employments, as Secretary of State, for <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular, for <HI>Britain</HI> in general, or Lord High Commi&s;&s;ioner of <HI>Scotland</HI>; which la&s;t Office he bore more than once; but at no time more honourably, and (as I hope) more hap|pily, both for the pre&s;ent Age, and for Po&s;terity, than when he laid the Foundation for the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Union. The Con&s;tancy and Addre&s;s which he manife&s;ted on that Occa&s;ion, are &s;till fre&s;h in every Body's Memory, and perhaps when our Children &s;hall reap tho&s;e Benefits from that Work, which &s;ome People do not fore&s;ee and hope for, now, they may remember the Duke of <HI>Queensberry</HI> with that Gra|titude, which &s;uch a piece of Service done to his Country de&s;erves.</P>
<P>He &s;hew'd upon all Occa&s;ions a &s;trict and immediate Attachment to the Crown, in the legal Service of which no Man could exert him|&s;elf more dutifully nor more &s;trenuou&s;ly. And at the &s;ame time no Man gave more bold and more generous Evidences of the Love he bore to his Country. Of the latter, there can be no better Proof than the &s;hare he had in the late happy Revolution; nor of the former than that dutiful Re&s;pect, and un&s;haken Fidelity which he pre&s;erv'd for Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, ev'n to his la&s;t moments.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">With &s;o many good and great Qualities, it is not at all &s;trange that he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd &s;o large a Share, as he was known to have, in the E&s;teem of the Queen, and Her immediate Predece&s;&s;or; nor that tho&s;e great Princes &s;hou'd repo&s;e the highe&s;t Confidence in him: And at the &s;ame time, what a Pattern has he left behind him for the Nobi|lity in general, and for Your Grace in particular to copy after.</P>
<P>Your Grace will forgive me, if my Zeal for Your Welfare and Honour (which no body has more at Heart than my &s;elf) &s;hall pre&s;s you with &s;ome more than ordinary Warmth to the Imitation of Your noble Father's Virtues. You have, My Lord, many great Ad|vantages which may encourage You to go on in pur&s;uit of this Repu|tation; it has pleas'd God to give You naturally, that Sweetne&s;s of Temper, which, as I have before hinted, is the the Foundation of all good Inclinations. You have the Honour to be born, not only of the greate&s;t, but of the be&s;t Parents; of a Gentleman generally belov'd, and generally lamented; and of a Lady adorn'd with all Vir|tues that enter into the Character of a good Wife, an admirable Friend, and a mo&s;t indulgent Mother. The natural Advantages of Your Mind, have been cultivated by the mo&s;t proper Arts and Manners of Education, You have the Care of many noble Friends, and e&s;pe|cially of an excellent Unkle, to watch over You in the Tenderne&s;s of Your Youth. You &s;et out among&s;t the fir&s;t of Mankind, and I doubt not but Your Virtues will be equal to the Dignity of Your Rank.</P>
<P>That I may live to &s;ee Your Grace eminent for the Love of Your Country, for Your Service and Duty to your Prince, and in conve|nient time, adorn'd with all the Honours that have ever been con|ferr'd upon Your Noble Family: That you may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd to Po&s;terity, as the Brave&s;t, Greate&s;t, and be&s;t Man of the Age You live in, is the hearty Wi&s;h, and Prayer of.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE; &s;poken by Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>.</HEAD>
<L>TO Night, if you have brought your good old Ta&s;te,</L>
<L>We'll treat you with a downright Engli&s;h Fea&s;t.</L>
<L>A Tale, which told long &s;ince in homely Wi&s;e,</L>
<L>Have n$ver fail'd of melting gentle Eyes:</L>
<L>Let no nice <HI>Sir</HI> de&s;pi&s;e our haple&s;s Dame,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e recording Ballads chaunt her Name;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e venerable ancient Song-Enditers</L>
<L>Scar'd many a Pitch above our modern Writers:</L>
<L>They caterwaul'd in no Romantick Ditty,</L>
<L>Sighing for <HI>Phillis</HI>'s, or <HI>Chloe</HI>'s Pity.</L>
<L>Ju&s;tly they drew the Fair, and &s;poke her plain,</L>
<L>And &s;ung her by her Chri&s;t'an Name&mdash;'twas <HI>Jane</HI>.</L>
<L>Our Numbers may be more refin'd than tho&s;e,</L>
<L>But what we've gain'd in Ver&s;e, we've lo&s;t in Pro&s;e.</L>
<L>Their Words no &s;huffling, double-meaning knew,</L>
<L>Their Speech was homely, but their Hearts were true.</L>
<L>In &s;uch an Age, Immortal <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> wrote,</L>
<L>By no quaint Rules, nor hampering Criticks taught;</L>
<L>With rough, maje&s;tick Force he mov'd the Heart,</L>
<L>And Strength, and Nature made amends for Art.</L>
<L>Our humble Author does his Steps pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>He owns he had the mighty Bard in View;</L>
<L>And in the&s;e Scenes has made it more his Care</L>
<L>To rou&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions, than to charm the Ear.</L>
<L>Yet for tho&s;e gentle <HI>Beaux</HI> who love the Chime,</L>
<L>The Ends of Acts &s;till gingle into Rhime.</L>
<L>The <HI>Ladies</HI> too, he hopes, will not complain,</L>
<L>Here are &s;ome Subjects for a &s;ofter Strain,</L>
<L>A Nymph for&s;aken, and a perjur'd Swain.</L>
<L>What mo&s;t he fears, is, lea&s;t the Dames &s;hou'd frown,</L>
<L>The Dames of Wit and Plea&s;ure about Town,</L>
<L>To &s;ee our Picture drawn, unlike their own.</L>
<L>But left that Error &s;hou'd provoke to Fury</L>
<L>The Ho&s;pitable Hundreds of <HI>Old Drury,</HI></L>
<L>He bid me &s;ay, in our <HI>Jane Shore</HI>'s Defence,</L>
<L>She d$l'd about the charitable Pence,</L>
<L>Built Ho&s;pitals, turn'd a Saint, and dy'd long &s;ince.</L>
<L>For her Example, what&s;oe'er we make it,</L>
<L>They have their Choice to let alone, or take it.</L>
<L>Tho', few, as I conceive, will think it meet,</L>
<L>To weep &s;o &s;orely, for a Sin &s;o &s;weet:</L>
<L>Or mourn and mortify the plea&s;ant Sen&s;e,</L>
<L>To ri&s;e in Tragedy two Ages hence.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE; &s;poken by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>.</HEAD>
<L>YE mode&s;t Matrons all, ye virtuous Wives,</L>
<L>Who lead with horrid Husbands, decent Lives,</L>
<L>You who for all you are in &s;uch a taking,</L>
<L>To &s;ee your Spou&s;es Drinking, Gaming, Raking,</L>
<L>Yet make a Con&s;cience &s;till of Cuckold-making,</L>
<L>What can we &s;ay your Pardon to obtain?</L>
<L>This Matter here was prov'd again&s;t poor <HI>Jane</HI>:</L>
<L>She never once deny'd it, but in &s;hort,</L>
<L>Whimper'd,&mdash;and Cry'd,&mdash;<HI>&s;weet Sir,&mdash;I'm &s;orry for't&punc;</HI></L>
<L>'Twas well &s;he met a kind, good natur'd Soul,</L>
<L>We are not all &s;o ea&s;y to controul:</L>
<L>I fancy one might find in this good Town</L>
<L>Some wou'd ha' told the Gentleman his own;</L>
<L>Have an&s;wer'd &s;mart,&mdash; <HI>To what do you pretend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Blockhead!&mdash; As if I mu&s;t n't &s;ee a Friend:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tell me of Hackney-Coaches&mdash;Jaunts to th' City&mdash;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where &s;hou'd I buy my China&mdash;Faith, I'll fit ye&mdash;</HI></L>
<L>Our Wife was of a milder, meeker Spirit:</L>
<L>You!&mdash;Lords and Ma&s;ters!&mdash;was not that &s;ome Merit?</L>
<L>Don't you allow it to be virtuous Bearing,</L>
<L>When we &s;ubmit thus to your Domineering.</L>
<L>Well, peace be with her, &s;he did Wrong mo&s;t &s;urely;</L>
<L>But &s;o do many more who look demurely:</L>
<L>Nor &s;hou'd our mourning Madam weep alone,</L>
<L>There are more Ways of Wickedne&s;s than one.</L>
<L>If the reforming Stage &s;hou'd fall to &s;haming</L>
<L>Ill-nature, Pride, Hypocri&s;y, and Gaming;</L>
<L>The Poets frequently might move Compa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>And with <HI>She</HI> Tragedies o'er-run the Nation.</L>
<L>Then judge the fair Offender, with good Nature;</L>
<L>And let your Fellow-feeling curb your Satyr.</L>
<L>What if our Neighbours have &s;ome little Failing,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t we needs fall to damning and to railing:</L>
<L>For Her Excu&s;e too, be it under&s;tood,</L>
<L>That if the Woman was not quite &s;o good,</L>
<L>Her Lover was a King, &s;he Fle&s;h and Blood.</L>
<L>And &s;ince &s;he has dearly paid the &s;inful Score,</L>
<L>Be kind at la&s;t, and pity poor <HI>Jane Shore</HI>.</L>
