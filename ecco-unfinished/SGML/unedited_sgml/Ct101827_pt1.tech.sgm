an author who&s;e early love of the

the protection of a predece&s;&s;or of
yours in the direction of the theatre&mdash;
Sir RICHARD STEELE, who, like
Mr. HARRIS, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon
&s;hare of benevolence. He acted as You
would have done: he promoted his
intere&s;t with the utmo&s;t zeal, related
his misfortunes, extolled his merit,
and took all opportunities of re|commending
him. The unfortunate
SAVAGE, in return, would have joined
with others in acknowledging Your
worth and merit, in directing the
mo&s;t rational entertainment of an
<PB REF="5">
enlightened people. It requires no
common exertion of &s;pirit, activity
and abilities to be competitor for the

<PB REF="8">
<HEAD>LIFE
OF THE
AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved in all ages, that the ad|vantages
of nature or of fortune have contributed
$ery little to the promotion of happine&s;s; and that
tho&s;e whom the &s;plendor of their rank, or the extent
of their capacity, have placed upon the &s;ummits of
human life&punc; have not often given any ju&s;t occa&s;ion
to envy in tho&s;e who look up to them from a lower
&s;tation. Whether it be that apparent &s;uperiority
incites great de&s;igns, and great de&s;igns are naturally
liable to fatal mi&s;carriages; or that the general lot
of mankind is mi&s;ery, and the mi&s;fortunes of tho&s;e
who&s;e eminence drew upon them an univer&s;al atten|tion,
have been more carefully recorded, becau&s;e
they were more generally ob&s;erved, and have in
reality been only more con&s;picuous than tho&s;e of
other$, not more frequent, or more &s;evere.</P>
<P>That affluence and power, advantages extrin&s;ic
and adventitious, and therefore ea&s;ily &s;eparable from
tho&s;e by whom they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;hould very often
flatter the mind with expectations of felicity which
they cannot give, rai&s;es no a&s;toni&s;hment; but it
&s;eems rational to hope, that intellectual greatne&s;s
&s;hould produce better effects; that minds qualified
for great attainments &s;hould fir&s;t endeavour their
own benefit; and that they who are mo&s;t able to
teach others the way to happine&s;s, &s;hould with mo&s;t
certainty follow it them&s;elve$&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="9">
But this expectation, however plau&s;ible, has been
very frequently di&s;appointed. The heroes of literary
as well as civil hi&s;tory have been very often no le&s;s
remarkable for what they have &s;uffered, than for
what they have atchieved; and volume, have been
written only to enumerate the mi&s;eries of the learned,
and relate their unhappy lives, and untimely deaths.</P>
<P>To the&s;e mournful narratives, I am about to add
the Life of Richard Savage, a man who&s;e writings
intitle him to an eminent rank in the cla&s;&s;es of
learning, and who&s;e misfortunes claim a degree of
compa&s;&s;ion, not always due to the unhappy, as they
were often the con&s;equences of the crimes of others,
rather than his own.</P>
<P>In the year 1697, Anne Counte&s;s of Macclesfield,
having lived for &s;ome time upon very unea&s;y terms
with her hu&s;band, thought a public confe&s;&s;ion of
adultery the mo&s;t obvious and expeditious method
of obtaining her liberty; and therefore declared,
that the child, with which &s;he was then great, was
begotten by the Earl Rivers. This, as may be ea&s;ily
imagined, made her hu&s;band no le&s;s de&s;irous of a
&s;eparation than her&s;elf, and he pro&s;ecuted his de&s;ign
in the mo&s;t effectual manner; for he applied not to
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts for a divorce, but to the par|liament
for an act, by which his marriage might be
di&s;&s;olved, the nuptial contract totally annulled, and
the children of his wife illegitimated. This act,
after the u&s;ual deliberation, he obtained, tho' with|out
the approbation of &s;ome, who con&s;idered mar|riage
as an affair only cognizable by eccle&s;ia&s;tical
judges<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>$word$ year was made remarkable by the di&s;&s;olution of $word$ $word$ $word$ in the face of the church. SALMON'S $word$</P>

</LETTER></NOTE>; and on March 3d was &s;eparated from his
<PB N="v" REF="10">
wife, who&s;e fortune, which was very great, was re|paid
her; and who having, as well as her hu&s;band,
the liberty of making another choice, was in a &s;hort
time married to Colonel Bret.</P>
<P>While the Earl of Macclesfield was pro&s;ecuting
thi$ affair, his wife was&punc; on the 10th of January
1697-8, delivered of a &s;on, and the Earl Rivers,
by appearing to con&s;ider him as his own, left none
any rea&s;on to doubt of the &s;incerity of her declara|tion;
for he was his godfather, and gave him his
own name, which was by his direction in&s;erted in
the regi&s;ter of St. Andrew's pari&s;h in Holborn, but
unfortunately left him to the care of his mother,
whom, as &s;he was now &s;et free from her hu&s;band,
he probably imagined likely to treat with great ten|derne&s;s
the child that had contributed to &s;o plea&s;ing
an event. It is not indeed ea&s;y to di&s;cover what
motives could be found to overbalance that natural
affection of a parent, or what intere&s;t could be pro|moted
by neglect or cruelty. The dread of &s;hame
or of poverty, by which &s;ome wretches have been
incited to abandon or to murder their children, can|not
be &s;uppo&s;ed to have affected a woman who had
proclaimed her crimes and &s;olicited reproach, and
on whom the clemency of the legi&s;lature had un|de&s;ervedly
be&s;towed a fortune, which would have
been very little dimini&s;hed by the expences which
<PB N="vi" REF="11">
the care of her child could have brought upon her&punc;
It was therefore not likely that &s;he would be wicked
without temptation, that &s;he would look upon her
&s;on from his birth with a kind of re&s;entment and
abhorrence; and in&s;tead of &s;upporting, a&s;&s;i&s;ting,
and defending him, delight to &s;ee him &s;truggling
with mi&s;ery, or that &s;he would take every oppor|tunity
of aggravating his misfortunes, and ob&s;truct|ing
his re&s;ources, and with an implacable and re&s;t|le&s;s
cruelty continue her per&s;ecution from the fir&s;t
hour of his life to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>But whatever were her motives, no &s;ooner was
her &s;on born, than &s;he di&s;covered a re&s;olution of
di&s;owning him; and in a very &s;hort time removed
him from her &s;ight, by committing him to the care
of a poor woman, whom &s;he directed to educate him
as her own, and injoined never to inform him of
his true parents.</P>
<P>Such was the beginning of the life of Richard
Savage: Born with a legal claim to honour and to
affluence, he was in two months illegitimated by
the parliament, and di&s;owned by his mother, doomed
to poverty and ob&s;curity, and launched upon the
ocean of life, only that he might be &s;wallowed by
its quick&s;ands, or d$&s;hed upon its rocks.</P>
<P>His mother could not indeed infect others with
the &s;ame cruelty. As it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid the
inquiries which the curio&s;ity or tenderne&s;s of her
relations made after her child, &s;he was obliged to
give &s;ome account of the mea&s;ures that &s;he had
taken; and her mother, the Lady Ma&s;on, whether
in approbation of her de&s;ign, or to prevent more
$$minal contrivances, engaged to tran&s;act with the
nur&s;e, to pay her for her care, and to &s;uperintend
the edu$$$$on of the child.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="12">
In this charitable office &s;he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his
godmother Mrs. Loyd, who, while &s;he lived, always
looked upon him with that tenderne&s;s, which the
barbarity of his mother made peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary;
but her death, which happened in his tenth year,
was another of the misfortunes of his childhood;
for though &s;he kindly endeavoured to alleviate his
lo&s;s by a legacy of three hundred pounds, yet, as
he had none to pro&s;ecute his claim, to &s;helter him
from oppre&s;&s;ion, or call in law to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
ju&s;tice, her will was eluded by the executors, and
no part of the money was ever paid.</P>
<P>He was however not yet wholly abandoned. The
Lady Ma&s;on &s;till continued her care, and directed
him to be placed at a &s;mall grammar-&s;chool near
St. Alban's, where he was called by the name of
his nur&s;e, without the lea&s;t intimation that he had
a claim to any other.</P>
<P>Here he was initiated in literature, and pa&s;&s;ed
through &s;everal of the cla&s;&s;es, with what rapidity
or what applau&s;e cannot now be known. As he
always &s;poke with re&s;pect of his ma&s;ter, it is pro|bable
that the mean rank, in which he then ap|peared,
did not hinder his genius from being di&s;tin|gui&s;hed,
or his indu&s;try from being rewarded; and
if in &s;o low a &s;tate he obtained di&s;tinction and re|wards,
it is not likely that they were gained but by
genius and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>It is very rea&s;onable to conjecture, that his ap|plication
was equal to his abilities, becau&s;e his im|provement
was more than proportioned to the op|portunities
which he enjoyed; nor can it be doubted,
that if his earlie&s;t productions had been pre&s;erved,
like tho&s;e of happier &s;tudents, we might in &s;ome
have found vigorous &s;allies of that &s;prightly humour,
<PB N="viii" REF="13">
which di&s;tingui&s;hes THE AUTHOR TO BE LET, and
in others, &s;trong touches of that ardent imagination
which painted the &s;olemn &s;cenes of THE WAN|DERER.</P>
<P>While he was thus cultivating his genius, his
father the Earl Rivers was &s;eized with a di&s;temper,
which in a &s;hort time put an end to his life. He
had frequently inquired after his &s;on, and had always
been amu&s;ed with fallacious and eva&s;ive an&s;wers;
but being now in his own opinion on his death-bed,
he thought it his duty to provide for him among his
other natural children, and therefore demanded a
po&s;itive account of him, with an importunity not
to be diverted or denied. His mother, who could
no longer refu&s;e an an&s;wer, determined at lea&s;t to
give &s;uch as &s;hould cut him off for ever from that
happine&s;s which competence affords, and therefore
declared that he was dead; which is perhaps the fir&s;t
in&s;tance of a lie invented by a mother to deprive her
&s;on of a provi&s;ion which was de&s;igned him by ano|ther,
and which &s;he could not expect her&s;elf, though
he &s;hould lo&s;e it.</P>
<P>This was therefore an act of wickedne&s;s which
which could not be defeated, becau&s;e it could not
be &s;u&s;pected; the Earl did not imagine, that there
could exi&s;t in a human form a mother that would
ruin her &s;on without enriching her&s;elf, and there|fore
be&s;towed upon &s;ome other per&s;on &s;ix thou&s;and
pounds, which he had in his will bequeathed to
Savage.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cruelty which incited his mother to
intercept this provi&s;ion which had been intended
him, prompted her in a &s;hort time to another pro|ject,
a project worthy of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition. She
endeavoured to rid her&s;elf from the danger of being
<PB N="ix" REF="14">
at any time made known to him, by &s;ending him
&s;ecretly to the American plantations<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Savage's Preface to his Mi&s;cellany.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By who&s;e kindne&s;s this &s;cheme was counteracted,
or by what interpo&s;ition &s;he was induced to lay a&s;ide
her de&s;ign, I know not; it is not improbable that
the Lady Ma&s;on might per&s;uade or compel her to
de&s;i&s;t, or perhaps &s;he could not ea&s;ily find accom|plices
wicked enough to concur in &s;o cruel an action;
for it may be conceived, that tho&s;e who had by a
long gradation of guilt hardened their hearts again&s;t
the &s;en&s;e of common wickedne&s;s, would yet be
&s;hocked at the de&s;ign of a mother to expo&s;e her &s;on
to &s;lavery and want, to expo&s;e him without intere&s;t,
and without provocation; and Savage might on this
occa&s;ion find protectors and advocates among tho&s;e
who had long traded in crimes, and whom com|pa&s;&s;ion
had never touched before.</P>
<P>Being hindered, by whatever means, from ba|ni&s;hing
him into another country, &s;he formed &s;oon
after a &s;cheme for burying him in poverty and ob|&s;curity
in his own; and that his &s;tation of life, if
not the place of his re&s;idence, might keep him for
ever at a di&s;tance from her, &s;he ordered him to be
placed with a &s;hoemaker in Holborn, that after the
u&s;ual time of trial, he might become his appren|tice<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Preface to Savage's Mi&s;cellanies.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is generally reported, that this project was for
&s;ome time &s;ucce&s;sful, and that Savage was employed
at the awl longer than he was willing to confe&s;s;
nor was it perhaps any great advantage to him, that
an unexpected di&s;covery determined him to quit his
occupation.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="15">
About this time his nur&s;e, who had always treated
him as her own &s;on, died; and it was natural for
him to take care of tho&s;e effects, which by her death
were, as he imagined, become his own; he there|fore
went to her hou&s;e, opened her boxes, and ex|amined
her papers, among which he found &s;ome
letters written to her by the Lady Ma&s;on, which
inform'd him of his birth, and the rea&s;ons for which
it was concealed.</P>
<P>He was now no longer &s;atisfied with the employ|ment
which had been allotted him, but thought he
had a right to &s;hare the affluence of his mother, and
therefore without &s;cruple applied to her as her &s;on,
and made u&s;e of every art to awaken her tenderne&s;s,
and attract her regard. But neither his letters, nor
the interpo&s;ition of tho&s;e friends which his merit or
his di&s;tre&s;s procured him, made any impre&s;&s;ion upon
her mind: She &s;till re&s;olved to neglect, though &s;he
could no longer di&s;own him.</P>
<P>It was to no purpo&s;e that he frequently &s;olicited
her to admit him to &s;ee her; &s;he avoided him with
the mo&s;t vigilant precaution, and ordered him to
be excluded from her hou&s;e, by whom&s;oever he
might be introduced, and what rea&s;on &s;oever he
might give for entering it.</P>
<P>Savage was at the &s;ame time &s;o touched with the
di&s;covery of his real mother, that it was his frequent
practice to walk in the dark evenings<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">PLAIN DEALER, See Ap$$ndix.</NOTE> for &s;everal
hours before her door, in hopes of &s;eeing her as &s;he
might come by accident to the window, or cro&s;s her
apartment with a candle in her hand.</P>
<P>But all his a&s;&s;iduity and tenderne&s;s were without
effect, for he could neither &s;often her heart, nor
<PB N="xi" REF="16">
open her hand, and was reduced to the utmo&s;t mi|&s;eries
of want, while he was endeavouring to awaken
the affection of a mother: He was therefore obliged
to &s;eek &s;ome other means of &s;upport, and having
no profe&s;&s;ion, became, by nece&s;&s;ity, an author.</P>
<P>At this time the attention of all the literary world
was engro&s;&s;ed by the Bangorian controver&s;y, which
filled the pre&s;s with pamphlets, and the coffee-hou&s;es
with di&s;putants. Of this &s;ubject, as mo&s;t popular,
he made choice for his fir&s;t attempt, and without
any other knowledge of the que&s;tion, than he had
ca&s;ually collected from conver&s;ation, publi&s;hed a
poem again&s;t the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>What was the &s;ucce&s;s or merit of this performance
I know not; it was probably lo&s;t among the innu|merable
pamphlets to which that di&s;pute gave occa|&s;ion.
Mr. Savage was him&s;elf in a little time
a&s;hamed of it, and endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s it, by
de&s;troying all the copies that he could collect.</P>
<P>He then attempted a more gainful kind of wri|ting<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jacob's Lives of Dramatic Poets.</NOTE>,
and in his eighteenth year offered to the
&s;tage a comedy borrowed from a Spani&s;h plot, which
was refu&s;ed by the players, and was therefore given
by him to Mr. Bullock, who, having more intere&s;t,
made &s;ome &s;light alterations, and brought it upon
the &s;tage, under the title of<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thi$ play was printed fir&s;t in 8$0, and afterw$rds in 12mo, the f$fth $word$.</NOTE> WOMAN'S A RIDDLE,
but allowed the unhappy author no part of the
profit.</P>
<P>Not di&s;couraged however at his repul&s;e, he wrote
two years afterwards LOVE IN A $E$L, another
comedy, borrowed likewi&s;e from the Spani&s;h, but
<PB N="xii" REF="17">
with little better &s;ucce&s;s than before; for though it
was received and acted, yet it appeared &s;o late in
the year, that the author obtained no other advan|tage
from it, than the acquaintance of Sir Richard
Steele, and Mr. Wilks; by whom he was pitied,
care&s;&s;ed, and relieved.</P>
<P>Sir Richard Steele having declared in his favour
with all the ardour of benevolence which con&s;tituted
his character, promoted his intere&s;t with the utmo&s;t
zeal, related his misfortunes, applauded his merit,
took all opportunities of recommending him, and
a&s;&s;erted,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">PLAIN DEALER.</NOTE> that &startq;the inhumanity of his mother had
given him a right to find every good man his father.&endq;</P>
<P>Nor was Mr. Savage admitted to his acquaintance
only, but to his confidence, of which he &s;ometimes
related an in&s;tance too extraordinary to be omitted,
as it affords a very ju&s;t idea of his patron's cha|racter.</P>
<P>He was once de&s;ired by Sir Richard, with an air
of the utmo&s;t importance, to come very early to his
hou&s;e the next morning. Mr. Savage came as he
had promi&s;ed, found the chariot at the door, and
Sir Richard waiting for him, and ready to go out.
What was intended, and whither they were to go,
Savage could not conjecture, and was not willing
to enquire; but immediately &s;eated him&s;elf with
Sir Richard; the coachman was ordered to drive,
and they hurried with the utmo&s;t expedition to
Hyde-Park Corner, where they &s;topped at a petty
tavern, and retired to a private room. Sir Richard
then informed him, that he intended to publi&s;h a
pamphlet, and that he had de&s;ired him to come
thither that he might write for him. They &s;oon &s;at
<PB N="xiii" REF="18">
down to the work. Sir Richard dictated, and Savage
wrote, till the dinner that had been ordered was
put upon the table. Savage was &s;urprized at the
meanne&s;s of the entertainment, and after &s;ome he|&s;itation
ventured to a&s;k for wine, which Sir Richard,
not without reluctance, ordered to be brought.
They then fini&s;hed their dinner, and proceeded in
their pamphlet, which they concluded in the after|noon.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage then imagined his ta&s;k over, and ex|pected
that Sir Richard would call for the reckoning,
and return home; but his expectations deceived him,
for Sir Richard told him, that he was without
money, and that the pamphlet mu&s;t be &s;old before
the dinner could be paid for; and Savage was there|fore
obliged to go and offer their new production to
&s;ale for two guineas, which with &s;ome difficulty he
obtained. Sir Richard then returned home, having
retired that day only to avoid his creditors, and
compo&s;ed the pamphlet only to di&s;charge his reck|oning.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage related another fact equally uncom|mon,
which, though it has no relation to his life,
ought to be pre&s;erved. Sir Richard Steele having
one day invited to his hou&s;e a great number of per|&s;ons
of the fir&s;t quality, they were &s;urpri&s;ed at the
number of liveries which &s;urrounded the table; and
after dinner, when wine and mirth had &s;et them
free from the ob&s;ervation of rigid ceremony, one of
them enquired of Sir Richard, how &s;uch an expen|&s;ive
train of dome&s;tics could be con&s;i&s;tent with his
fortune. Sir Richard very frankly confe&s;&s;ed, that
they were fellows of whom he wou$d very willingly
be rid. And being then a&s;ked, why he did not
di&s;charge them, declared that they were b$$liffs who
<PB N="xiv" REF="19">
had introduced them&s;elves with an execution, and
whom, &s;ince he could not &s;end them away, he had
thought it convenient to embelli&s;h with liveries, that
they might do him credit while they &s;taid.</P>
<P>His friends were diverted with the expedient, and
by paying the debt di&s;charged their attendance,
having obliged Sir Richard to promi&s;e that they
&s;hould never again find him graced with a retinue
of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch a tutor, Mr. Savage was not likely
to learn prudence or frugality, and perhaps many
of the misfortunes which the want of tho&s;e virtues
brought upon him in the following parts of his life,
might be ju&s;tly imputed to &s;o unimproving an ex|ample.</P>
<P>Nor did the kindne&s;s of Sir Richard end in com|mon
favours. He propo&s;ed to have e&s;tabli&s;hed him
in &s;ome &s;ettled &s;cheme of life, and to have con|tracted
a kind of alliance with him, by marrying
him to a natural daughter, on whom he intended to
be&s;tow a thou&s;and pounds. But though he was
always lavi&s;h of future bounties, he conducted his
affairs in &s;uch a manner, that he was very &s;eldom
able to keep his promi&s;es, or execute his own in|tentions;
and as he was never able to rai&s;e the &s;um
which he had offered, the marriage was delayed.
In the mean time he was officiou&s;ly informed that
Mr. Savage had ridiculed him; by which he was
&s;o much exa&s;perated, that he withdrew the allow|ance
which he had paid him, and never afterwards
admitted him to his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not indeed unlikely that Savage might by his
imprudence expo&s;e him&s;elf to the malice of a tale|beare$;
for his patron had many follies, which as
his di&s;c$rnment ea&s;ily di&s;covered, his imagination
<PB N="xv" REF="20">
might &s;ometimes incite him to mention too ludi|crou&s;ly.
A little knowledge of the world is &s;ufficient
to di&s;cover that &s;uch weakne&s;s is very common, and
that there are few who do not &s;ometimes, in the
wantonne&s;s of thoughtle&s;s mirth, or the heat of
tran&s;ient re&s;entment, &s;peak of their friends and
benefactors with levity and contempt, though in
their cooler moments they want neither &s;en&s;e of
their kindne&s;s, nor reverence for their virtue. The
fault therefore of Mr. Savage was rather negligence
than ingratitude; but Sir Richard mu&s;t likewi&s;e be
acquitted of &s;everity, for who is there that can
patiently bear contempt from one whom he has
relieved and &s;upported, who&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hment he has
laboured, and who&s;e intere&s;t he has promoted?</P>
<P>He was now again abandoned to fortune, without
any other friend than than Mr. Wilks; a man,
who, whatever were his abilities or &s;kill as an actor,
de&s;erves at lea&s;t to be remembered for his virtues<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As it is a l$&s;s to mankind when any good action is for|gotten, I &s;hall in&s;ert another in&s;tance of Mr. Wilks's genero&s;ity, very little known. Mr. Smith, a gentleman educated at Dublin, being hindered by an impediment in his pronunciation from engaging in orde$$, for which his friends de&s;igned him, left his own country, and came to London in que&s;t of employment, but found his &s;olicitations fruitle&s;s, and his nece&s;&s;ities every day more pre&s;&s;ing. In this di&s;tre&s;s he wrote a tragedy, and offered it to the players, by whom it was rejected. Thus were his la&s;t hopes defeated, and he had no other pro&s;pect than of the mo&s;t de|plorable poverty. But Mr. Wilks thought his performance, though not perfect, at lea&s;t worthy of &s;ome $word$, and there|fore off$red him a benefit. This favour he improved with &s;o much diligence, that the hou&s;e $fforded him a con&s;iderable &s;um, with which he went to Leyden, applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, and pro&s;ecuted his de&s;ign with &s;o much diligence and &s;ucce&s;s, that when Dr. $word$ was de&s;ired by the Czarina to recommend proper per&s;ons to introduce into Ru&s;&s;ia the practice and &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, Dr. Smith was one of tho&s;e whom he &s;elected. He had a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion &s;ettled on him at his arrival, and was one of the chief phy&s;icians at the Ru&s;&s;ian court.</NOTE>,

which are not often to be found in the world, and
perhaps le&s;s often in his profe&s;&s;ion than in others.
To be humane, generous and candid, is a very high
degree of merit in any ca&s;e; but tho&s;e qualities
de&s;erve &s;till greater prai&s;e, when they are found in
that condition, which makes almo&s;t every other man,
for whatever rea&s;on, contemptuous, in&s;olent, petu|lant,
&s;elfi&s;h, and brutal.</P>
<P>As Mr. Wilks was one of tho&s;e to whom calamity
&s;eldom complained without relief, he naturally took
an unfortunate wit into his protection, and not only
a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in any ca&s;ual di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but continued
an equal and &s;teady kindne&s;s to the time of his death.</P>
<P>By his interpo&s;ition Mr. Savage once obtained
from his mother<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This I write upon the credit of the author of his life, which was publi&s;hed 1727.</NOTE> fifty pounds, and a promi&s;e of
one hundred and fifty more; but it was the &s;ate of
this unhappy man, that few promi&s;es of any ad|vantage
to him were performed. His mother was
infected among others with the general madne&s;s of
the South-Sea traffic, and having been di&s;appointed
in her expectations, refu&s;ed to pay what perhaps
nothing but the pro&s;pect of &s;udden affluence prompt|ed
her to promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Being thus obliged to depend upon the friend&s;hip
of Mr. Wilks, he was con&s;equently an a&s;&s;iduous
frequenter of the theatres, and in a &s;hort time the
amu&s;ements of the &s;tage took &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
mind, that he never was ab&s;ent from a play in
&s;everal years.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="22">
This con&s;tant attendance naturally procured him
the acquaintance of the players, and among others,
of Mrs. Oldfield, who was &s;o much plea&s;ed with
his conver&s;ation, and touched with his misfortunes,
that &s;he allowed him a &s;ettled pen&s;ion of fifty pounds
a year, which was during her life regularly paid.</P>
<P>That this act of genero&s;ity may receive its due
prai&s;e, and that the good actions of Mrs. Oldfield
may not be &s;ullied by her general character, it is
proper to mention what Mr. Savage often declared
in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that he never &s;aw her alone,
or in any other place than behind the &s;cenes.</P>
<P>At her death he endeavoured to &s;hew his gratitude
in the mo&s;t decent manner, by wearing mourning
as for a mother, but did not celebrate her in elegies,
becau&s;e he knew that too great profu&s;ion of prai&s;e
would only have revived tho&s;e faults which his
natural equity did not allow him to think le&s;s,
becau&s;e they were committed by one who favoured
him; but of which, though his virtue would not
endeavour to palliate them, his gratitude would not
&s;uffer him to prolong the memory, or diffu&s;e the
cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>In his WANDERER, he has indeed taken an op|portunity
of mentioning her, but celebrates her not
for her virtue, but her beauty, an excellence which
none ever denied her: This is the only encomium
with which he has rewarded her liberality, and per|haps
he has even in this been too lavi&s;h of his prai&s;e.
He &s;eems to have thought, that never to mention
his benefactre&s;s would have an appearance of ingra|titude,
though to have dedicated any particular per|formance
to her memory would have only betrayed
an officious partiality, that, without exalting her
character, would have depre&s;&s;ed his own.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="23">
He had &s;ometimes, by the kindne&s;s of Mr. Wilks,
the advantag$ of a benefit, on which occa&s;ions he
often received uncommon marks of regard and com|pa&s;&s;ion;
and was once told by the Duke of Dor&s;et,
that it was ju&s;t to con&s;ider him as an injured noble|man,
and that in his opinion the nobility ought to
think them&s;elves obliged, without &s;olicitation, to
take every opportunity of &s;upporting him by their
countenance and patronage. But he had generally
the mortification to hear that the whole intere&s;t of
his mother was employed to $word$ his applications,
and that &s;he never left any $$pedient untried, by
which he might be cut off $$om the po&s;&s;ibility of
&s;upporting life. The &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition &s;he endea|voured
to diffu&s;e among all tho&s;e over whom nature
or fortune gave her any influence, and indeed suc|ceeded
too well in her de&s;ign; but could not always
propagate her effrontery with her cruelty, for &s;ome
of tho&s;e, whom &s;he incited again&s;t him, were a&s;hamed
of their own conduct, and boa&s;ted of that relief
which they never gave him.</P>
<P>In this cen&s;ure I do not indi&s;criminately involve
all his relations; fo$ A $word$, mentioned with gratitude

unable to recollect, and to whom therefore I cannot

well in oppo&s;ition to influence, precept, and ex|ample.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment which our laws inflict upon tho&s;e
parents who murder their infants is well known, nor
has its ju&s;tice ever been conte&s;ted; but if they de|&s;erve
death, who de&s;troy a child in its birth, what
pains can be &s;evere enough for her who forbears to
de&s;troy him only to inflict &s;harper mi&s;eries upon
him; who prolong his life only to make it mi|&s;erable;
<PB N="xix" REF="24">
and who expo&s;es him, without care and
without pity, to the malice of oppre&s;&s;ion, the ca|prices
of chance, and the temptations of poverty;
who rejoices to &s;ee him overwhelmed with cala|mities;
and when his own indu&s;try, or the charity
of others, has enabled him to ri&s;e for a &s;hort time
above his mi&s;eries, plunges him again into his for|mer
di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>The kindne&s;s of his friends not affording him any
con&s;tant &s;upply, and the pro&s;pect of improving his
fortune, by enlarging his acquaintance, nece&s;&s;arily
leading him to places of expence, he found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In 1$24.</NOTE>
to endeavour once more at dramatic poetry,
for which he was now better qualified by a more
exten&s;ive knowledge, and longer ob&s;ervation. But
having been un&s;ucce&s;sful in comedy, though rather
for want of opportunities than genius, he re&s;olved
now to try whether he &s;hould not be more fortunate
in exhibiting a tragedy.</P>
<P>The &s;tory which he cho&s;e for the &s;ubject, was that
of Sir Thomas Overbury, a &s;tory well adapted to
the &s;tage, though perhaps not far enough removed
from the pre&s;ent age, to admit properly the fictions
nece&s;&s;ary to complete the plan; for the mind, which
naturally love$ truth, is always mo&s;t offended with
the violation of tho&s;e truths of which we are mo&s;t
certain, and we of cour&s;e conceive tho&s;e facts mo&s;t
certain, which approach neare&s;t to our own time.</P>
<P>Out of this &s;tory he formed a tragedy, which, if
the circum&s;tances in which he wrote it be con&s;idered,
will afford at once an uncommon proof of &s;trength
of genius, and evenne&s;s of mind, of a &s;erenity not
$word$ be ru$$$ed, and an imagination not to be $word$</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="25">
During a con&s;iderable part of the time, in which
his was employed upon this performance, he was
without lodging, and often without meat; nor had
he any other conveniences for &s;tudy than the fields
or the &s;treet allowed him; there he u&s;ed to walk
and form his &s;peeches, and afterwards &s;tep into a
&s;hop, beg for a few moments the u&s;e of the pen and
ink, and write down what he had compo&s;ed upon
paper, which he had picked up by accident.</P>
<P>If the performance of a writer thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed is
not perfect, its faults ought &s;urely to be imputed to
a cau&s;e very different from want of genius, and
mu&s;t rather excite pity than provoke cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>But when under the&s;e di&s;couragements the tragedy
was fini&s;hed, there yet remained the labour of in|troducing
it on the &s;tage, an undertaking, which,
to an ingenuous mind, was in a very high degree
vexatious and di&s;gu&s;ting; for having little intere&s;t
or reputation, he was obliged to &s;ubmit him&s;elf
wholly to the players, and admit, with whatever
reluctance, the emendations of Mr. Cibber, which
he always con&s;idered as the di&s;grace of his per|formance.</P>
<P>He had indeed in Mr. Hill another critic of a
very different cla&s;s, from who&s;e friend&s;hip he re|received
great a&s;&s;i&s;tance on many occa&s;ions, and
whom he never mentioned but with the utmo&s;t ten|derne&s;s
and regard*. He had been for &s;ome time
di&s;tingui&s;hed by him with very particular kindne&s;s,
and on this occa&s;ion it was natural to apply to him
as an author of an e&s;tabli&s;hed character. He there|fore
&s;ent this tragedy to him, with a &s;hort copy of
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 181.</NOTE><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 150.</NOTE>ver&s;es, in which he de&s;ired his correction. Mr. Hill,
who&s;e humanity and politene&s;s are generally known
readily complied with his reque&s;t; but as he is re|markable
<PB N="xxi" REF="26">
for &s;ingularity of &s;entiment, and bold ex|periments
in language, Mr. Savage did not think
his play much improved by his innovation, and had
even at that time the courage to reject &s;everal pa&s;|&s;ages
which he could not approve; and what is &s;till
more laudable, Mr. Hill had the genero&s;ity not to
re&s;ent the neglect of his alterations, but wrote the
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 148. 186.</NOTE>prologue and epilogue, in which he touches on the
circum&s;tances of the author with great tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e ob&s;tructions and compliances, he
was only able to bring his play upon the &s;tage in the
&s;ummer, when the chief actors had retired, and the
re&s;t were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e for their own
advantage. Among the&s;e, Mr. Savage was admitted
to play the part of Sir Thomas Overbury, by which
he gained no great reputation, the theatre being a
a province for which nature &s;eemed not to have de|&s;igned
him; for neither his voice, look, nor ge&s;ture,
were &s;uch as are expected on the &s;tage, and he was
him&s;elf &s;o much a&s;hamed of having been reduced
to appear as a player, that he always blotted out his
name from the li&s;t, when a copy of his tragedy was
to be &s;hown to his friends.</P>
<P>In the publication of his performance he was more
&s;ucce&s;sful, for the rays of genius that glimmered in
it, that glimmered through all the mi&s;ts which po|verty
and Cibber had been able to &s;pread over it,
procured him the notice and e&s;teem of many per&s;ons
eminent for their rank, their virtue, and their wit.</P>
<P>Of this play, acted, printed, and dedicated, the
accumulated profits aro&s;e to an hundred pounds,
which he thought at that time a very large &s;um,
having been never ma&s;ter of &s;o much before.</P>
<P>In the Dedication<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">T$ $word$ $word$ E&s;q. of Hereford&s;hire, vol. I. p. 111.</NOTE>, for which he received ten
<PB N="xxii" REF="27">
guineas, there is nothing remarkable. The Preface
contains a very liberal encomium on the blooming
excellencies of Mr. Theophilus Cibber, which Mr.
Savage could not in the latter part of his life &s;ee his
friends about to read without &s;natching the play out
of their hands. The genero&s;ity of Mr. Hill did
not end on this occa&s;ion; for afterwards, when Mr.
Savage's nece&s;&s;ities returned, he encouraged a &s;ub|&s;cription

manner, by publi&s;hing his &s;tory in the

have written his Panegyrics for the peru&s;al only of
his patrons, and to have imagined that he had no
other ta&s;k than to pamper them with prai&s;es however
g$o&s;s, and that flattery would make its way to the
heart, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of elegance or inven|tion.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards the death of the l$ing furni&s;hed
a general &s;ubject for a poetical conte&s;t, in which
Mr. Savage engaged, and is allowed to have carried
the prize of honour from his competitors; but I
know not whether he gained by his performance any
other advantage than the increa&s;e of his reputation;
though it mu&s;t certainly have been with farther
views that he prevailed upon him&s;elf to attempt a
&s;pecies of writing, of which all the topics had been
long before exhau&s;ted, and which was made at once
difficult by the multitudes that had failed in it, and
tho&s;e that had &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>He was now advancing in reputation, and though
frequently involved in very di&s;tre&s;sful perplexities,
appeared however to be gaining upon mankind,
when both his fame and his life were endangered by
an event, of which it is not yet determined, whe|ther
it ought to be mentioned as a crime or a cala|mity.</P>
<P>On the 20th of November 1727, Mr. Savage
came from Richmond, where he then lodged, that
he might pur&s;ue his &s;tudies with le&s;s interruption,
with an intent to di&s;charge another lodging which
he had in We&s;tmin&s;ter, and accidentally meeting
two gentlemen his acquaintances, who&s;e names were
Merchant and Gregory, he went in with them to
a neighbouring coffee-hou&s;e, and &s;at drinking till
it was late, it being in no time of Mr. Savage's life
<PB N="xxix" REF="34">
any part of his character to be the fir&s;t of the com|pany
that de&s;ired to &s;eparate. He would willingly
have gone to bed in the &s;ame hou&s;e, but there was
not room for the whole company, and therefore they
agreed to ramble about the &s;treets, and divert them|&s;elves
with &s;uch amu&s;ements as &s;hould offer them|&s;elves
till morning.</P>
<P>In their walk they happened unluckily to di&s;cover
light in Robin&s;on's coffee-hou&s;e near Charing-cro&s;s,
and therefore went in. Merchant, with &s;ome rude|ne&s;s,
demanded a room, and was told that there was
a good fire in the next parlour, which the company
were about to leave, being then paying their reck|oning.
Merchant, not &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer,
ru&s;hed into the room, and was followed by his com|panions.
He then petulantly placed him&s;elf be|tween
the company and the fire, and &s;oon after
kicked down the table. This produced a quarrel,
&s;words were drawn on both &s;ides, and one Mr. James
Sinclair was killed. Savage having wounded like|wi&s;e
a maid that held him, forced his way with
Merchant out of the hou&s;e; but being intimidated
and confu&s;ed, without re&s;olution either to fly or &s;tay,
they were taken in a back court by one of the com|pany
and &s;ome &s;oldiers, whom he had called to his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Being &s;ecured and guarded that night, they were
in the morning carried before three ju&s;tices, who
committed them to the Gatehou&s;e, from whence,
upon the death of Mr. Sinclair, which happened
the &s;ame day, they were removed in the night to
Newgate, where they were however treated with
&s;ome di&s;tinction, exempted from the ignominy of
chains, and confined, not among the common cri|minals,
but in the Pre&s;$-yard.</P>
<P><PB N="xxx" REF="35">
When the day of trial came, the court was
crouded in a very unu&s;ual manner, and the public
appeared to intere&s;t it&s;elf as in a cau&s;e of general
concern. The witne&s;&s;es again&s;t Mr. Savage and his
friends were, the woman who kept the hou&s;e, which
was a hou&s;e of ill &s;ame, and her maid, the men
who were in the room with Mr. Sinclair, and a
woman of the town, who had been drinking with
them, and with whom one of them had been &s;een
in bed. They &s;wore in general, that Merchant gave
the provocation, which Savage and Gregory drew
their &s;words to ju&s;tify; that Savage drew fir&s;t, and
that he &s;tabbed Sinclair when he was not in a po&s;ture
of defence, or while Gregory commanded his &s;word;
that after he had given the thru&s;t he turned pale,
and would have retired, but that the maid clung
round him, and one of the company endeavoured
to detain him, from whom he broke, by cutting the
maid on the head, but was afterwards taken in a
court.</P>
<P>There was &s;ome difference in their depo&s;itions:
one did not &s;ee Savage give the wound, another
&s;aw it given when Sinclair held his point towards
the ground; and the woman of the town a&s;&s;erted,
that &s;he did not &s;ee Sinclair's &s;word at all: This
difference however was very far from amounting to
incon&s;i&s;tency, but it was &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the
hurry of the di&s;pute was &s;uch, that it was not ea&s;y
to di&s;cover the truth with relation to particular cir|cum&s;tances,
and that therefore &s;ome deductions were
to be made from the credibility of the te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>Sinclair had declared &s;everal times before his
death, that he received his wound from Savage, nor
did Savage at his trial deny the fact, but endea|voured
partly to extenuate it, by urging the &s;ud|denne&s;s
<PB N="xxxi" REF="36">
of the whole action, and the impo&s;&s;ibility
of any ill de&s;ign, or premeditated malice, and partly
to ju&s;tify it by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence, and the
hazard of his own life, if he had lo&s;t that oppor|tunity
of giving the thru&s;t: He ob&s;erved, that nei|ther
rea&s;on nor law obliged a man to wait for the
blow which was threatened, and which, if he &s;hould
&s;uffer it, he might never be able to return; that it
was always allowable to prevent an a&s;&s;ault, and to
pre&s;erve life by taking away that of the adver&s;ary,
by whom it was endangered.</P>
<P>With regard to the violence with which he en|deavoured
to e&s;cape, he declared, that it was not
his de&s;ign to fly from ju&s;tice, or decline a trial, but
to avoid the expences and &s;everities of a pri&s;on, and
that he intended to have appeared at the bar without
compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>This defence, which took up more than an hour,
was heard by the multitude that thronged the court
with the mo&s;t attentive and re&s;pectful &s;ilence: Tho&s;e
who thought he ought not to be acquitted, owned
that applau&s;e could not be refu&s;ed him; and tho&s;e
who before pitied his misfortunes, now reverenced
his abilities.</P>
<P>The witne&s;&s;es which appeared again&s;t him were
proved to be per&s;ons of characters which did not
entitle them to much credit; a common &s;trumpet,
a woman by whom &s;trumpets were entertained, and
a man by whom they were &s;upported; and the cha|racter
of Savage was by &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction
a&s;&s;erted to be that of a mode&s;t inoffen&s;ive man, not
inclined to broils, or to in&s;olence, and who had, to
that time, been only known for his misfortunes and
his wit.</P>
<P><PB N="xxxii" REF="37">
Had his audience been his judges, he had un|doubtedly
been acquitted; but Mr. Page, who was
then upon the bench, treated him with his u&s;ual
in&s;olence and &s;everity, and when he had &s;ummed up
the evidence, endeavoured to exa&s;perate the jury,
as Mr. Savage u&s;ed to relate it, with this eloquent
harangue.</P>
<P>&startq;Gentlemen of the jury, you are to con&s;ider that
Mr. Savage is a very great man, a much greater
man than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; that
he wears very fine clothes, much finer clothes than
you or I, gentlemen of the jury; that he has
abundance of money in his pocket, much more
money than you or I, gentlemen of the jury; but,
gentlemen of the jury, is it not a very hard ca&s;e,
gentlemen of the jury, that Mr. Savage &s;hould
therefore kill you or me, gentlemen of the jury?&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Savage hearing his defence thus mi&s;repre|&s;ented,
and the men who were to decide his fate
incited again&s;t him by invidious compari&s;ons, re&s;o|lutely
a&s;&s;erted, that his cau&s;e was not candidly ex|plained,
and began to recapitulate what he had
before &s;aid with regard to his condition, and the
nece&s;&s;ity of endeavouring to e&s;cape the expences of
impri&s;onment; but the judge having ordered him to
be &s;ilent, and repeated his orders without effect,
commanded that he &s;hould be taken from the bar
by force.</P>
<P>The jury then heard the opinion of the judge,
that good characters were of no weight again&s;t po|&s;itive
evidence, though they might turn the &s;cale,
where it was doubtful; and that though, when two
men attack each other, the death of either is only
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="38">
man&s;laughter; but where one is the aggre&s;&s;or, as in
the ca&s;e before them, and in pur&s;uance of his fir&s;t
attack, kills the other, the law &s;uppo&s;es the action,
however &s;udden, to be malicious. They then de|liberated
upon their verdict, and determined that
Mr. Savage and Mr. Gregory were guilty of murder,
and Mr. Merchant, who had no &s;word, only of
man&s;laughter.</P>
<P>Thus ended this memorable trial, which la&s;ted
eight hours. Mr. Savage and Mr. Gregory were
conducted back to pri&s;on, where they were more
clo&s;ely confined, and loaded with irons of fifty
pounds weight: Four days afterwards they were &s;ent
back to the court to receive &s;entence; on which
occa&s;ion Mr. Savage made, as far as it could be
retained in memory, the following &s;peech.</P>
<P>&startq;It is now, my Lord, too late to offer any thing
by way of defence or vindication; nor can we
expect ought from your Lord&s;hips, in this court,
but the &s;entence which the law requires you, as
judges, to pronounce again&s;t men of our calamitous
condition.&mdash;But we are al&s;o per&s;uaded, that as
mere men, and out of this &s;eat of rigorous ju&s;tice,
you are &s;u&s;ceptive of the tender pa&s;&s;ions, and too
humane, not to commi&s;erate the unhappy &s;ituation
of tho&s;e, whom the law &s;ometimes perhaps&mdash;exacts
&mdash;from you to pronounce upon. No doubt you
di&s;tingui&s;h between offences, which ari&s;e out of
premeditation, and a di&s;po&s;ition habituated to vice
or immorality, and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which are the
unhappy and unfore&s;een effects of ca&s;ual ab&s;ence
of rea&s;on, and &s;udden impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion: We
therefore hope you will contribute all you can to
an exten&s;ion of that mercy, which the gentlemen
of the jury have been plea&s;ed to &s;hew Mr. Mer|chant,
who (allowing facts as &s;worn again&s;t us by
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="39">
the evidence) has led us into this our calamity.
I hope this will not be con&s;trued, as if we meant
to reflect upon that gentleman, or remove any
thing from us upon him, or that we repine the
more at our fate, becau&s;e he has no participation
of it: No, my Lord! For my part, I declare
nothing could more &s;often my grief, than to be
without any companion in &s;o great a misfortune<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">M$ $word$ Life.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Savage had now no hopes of life, but from
the mercy of the crown, which was very earne&s;tly
&s;olicited by his friends, and which, with whatever
$$f$iculty the &s;tory may obtain belief, was ob&s;tructed
only by his mother.</P>
<P>To prejudice the Queen again&s;t him, &s;he made
u&s;e of an incident, which was omitted in the order
of time, that it might be mentioned together with
the purpo&s;e which it was made to &s;erve. Mr. Savage,
when he had di&s;co$ered his birth, had an inc$&s;&s;ant
de&s;ire to &s;peak to his mother, who always avoided
$word$ in public, and refu&s;ed him admi&s;&s;ion into her
$word$. One evening walking, as it was his cu&s;tom,
in the &s;treet that &s;he inhabited, he &s;aw the door of
her hou&s;e by accident open; he entered it, and
finding no per&s;ons in the pa&s;&s;age to hinder him,
$$nt up &s;tairs to &s;alute her. She di&s;covered him
before he could enter her chamber, alarmed the
family with the mo$$ di&s;tre&s;sful outcries, and when
&s;he had by her $word$ gathered them about her,
ordered them to drive out of the hou&s;e that villain,
who had forced him&s;elf in upon her, and endea|voured
to murder her. Savage, who had attempted
with the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s to &s;often her
rage, hearing her utter &s;o dete&s;table an accu&s;ation,
<PB N="xxxv" REF="40">
thought it prudent to retire, and, I believe, never
attempted afterwards to &s;peak to her.</P>
<P>But &s;hocked as he was with her fal&s;hood and her
cruelty, he imagined that &s;he intended no other u&s;e
of her lie, than to let her&s;elf free from his em|braces
and &s;olicitations, and was very far from &s;u&s;|pecting
that &s;he would trea&s;ure it in her memory,
as an in&s;trument of future wickedne&s;s, or that &s;he
would endeavour for this fictitious a&s;&s;ault to deprive
him of his life.</P>
<P>But when the Queen was &s;olicited for his pardon,
and informed of the &s;evere treatments which he had
&s;uffered from his judge, &s;he an&s;wered, that however
unju&s;tifiable might be the manner of his trial, or
whatever extenuation the action for which he was
condemned might admit, &s;he could not think that
man a proper object of the King's mercy, who had
been capable of entering his mother's hou&s;e in the
night, with an intent to murder her.</P>
<P>By whom this atrocious calumny had been tran&s;|mitted
to the Queen; whether &s;he that invented had
the front to relate it; whether &s;he found any one
weak enough to credit it, or corrupt enough to con|cur
with her in her hateful de&s;ign, I know not; but
methods had been taken to per&s;uade the Queen &s;o
&s;trongly of the truth of it, that &s;he for a long time
refu&s;ed to hear any of tho&s;e who petitioned for his
life.</P>
<P>Thus had Savage peri&s;hed by the evidence of a
bawd, a &s;trumpet, and his mother, had not ju&s;tice
and compa&s;&s;ion procured him an advocate of rank
too great to be rejected unheard, and of virtue too
eminent to be heard without being believed. His
merit and his calamities happened to r$$$h the ear
of the Counte&s;s of Hertford, who engaged in his
&s;upport with all the tenderne&s;s that is excised by
pity, and all the zeal which is kindled by genero&s;ity,
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="41">
and demanding an audience of the Queen, laid
before her the whole &s;eries of his mother's cruelty,
expo&s;ed the improbability of an accu&s;ation by which
he was charged with an intent to commit a murder,
that could produce no advantage, and &s;oon con|vinced
her how little his former conduct could de|&s;erve
to be mentioned as a rea&s;on for extraordinary
&s;everity.</P>
<P>The interpo&s;ition of this Lady was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful,
that he was &s;oon after admitted to bail, and on the
9th of March 1728, pleaded the King's pardon.</P>
<P>It is natural to enquire upon what motives his
mother could per&s;ecute him in a manner &s;o outra|geous
and implacable; for what rea&s;on &s;he could
employ all the acts of malice, and all the &s;nares of
calumny, to take away the life of her own &s;on, of
a &s;on who never injured her, who was never &s;up|ported
by her expence, nor ob&s;tructed any pro&s;pect
of plea&s;ure or advantage; why &s;he &s;hould endeavour
to de&s;troy him by a lie; a lie which could not gain
credit, but mu&s;t vani&s;h of it&s;elf at the fir&s;t moment
of examination, and of which only this can be &s;aid
to make it probable, that it may be ob&s;erved from
her conduct, that the mo&s;t execrable crimes are
&s;ometimes committed without apparent temptation.</P>
<P>This mother is &s;till alive, and may perhaps even
yet, though her malice was &s;o often defeated, enjoy
the plea&s;ure of reflecting, that the life which &s;he
often endeavoured to de&s;troy, was at lea&s;t &s;hortened
by her maternal offices; that though &s;he could not
tran&s;port her &s;on to the plantations, bury him in the
&s;hop of a mechanic, or ha&s;ten the hand of the public
executioner, &s;he has yet had the &s;atisfaction of im|bittering
all his hours, and forcing him into exi|gencies,
that hurried on his death.</P>
<P>It is by no means nece&s;&s;ary to aggravate the enor|mity
of this woman's conduct, by placing it in op|po&s;ition
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="42">
to that of the Counte&s;s of Hertford; no
one can fail to ob&s;erve how much more amiable it is
to relieve, than to oppre&s;s, and to re&s;cue innocence
from de&s;truction, than to de&s;troy without an&punc; injury.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage, during his impri&s;onment, his trial,
and the time in which he lay under &s;entence of
death, behaved with great firmne&s;s and equality of
mind, and confirmed by his fortitude the e&s;teem of
tho&s;e, who before admired him for his abilities.
The peculiar circum&s;tances of his life were made
more generally known by a &s;hort account<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Written by Mr. Beckingham and another gentleman.</NOTE>, which
was then publi&s;hed, and of which &s;everal thou&s;ands
were in a few weeks di&s;per&s;ed over the nation; and
the compa&s;&s;ion of mankind operated &s;o powerfully
in his favour, that he was enabled, by frequent
pre&s;ents, not only to &s;upport him&s;elf, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t
Mr. Gregory in pri&s;on; and when he was pardoned
and relea&s;ed, he found the number of his friends
not le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>The nature of the act for which he had been
tried was in it&s;elf doubtful; of the evidences which
appeared again&s;t him, the character of the man was
not unexceptionable, that of the women notoriou&s;ly
infamous: &s;he who&s;e te&s;timony chiefly influenced the
jury to condemn him, afterwards retracted her a&s;|&s;ertions.
He always him&s;elf denied that he was
drunk, as had been generally reported. Mr. Gre|gory,
who is now Collector of Antegua, is &s;aid to
declare him &s;ar le&s;s criminal than he was imagined,
even by &s;ome who &s;avoured him: And Page him&s;elf
afterwards confe&s;&s;ed, that he had treated him with
uncommon rigour. When all the&s;e particulars are
rated together, perhaps the memory of Savage may
not be much &s;ullied by his trial.</P>
<P>Some time after he had obtained his liberty, he
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="43">
met in the &s;treet the woman that had &s;worn with &s;o
much malignity again&s;t him. She informed him,
that &s;he was in di&s;tre&s;s, and, with a degree of con|fidence
not ea&s;ily attainable, de&s;ired him to relieve
her. He, in&s;tead of in&s;ulting her mi&s;ery, and
taking plea&s;ure in the calamities of one who had
brought his life into danger, reproved her gently
for her perjury, and changing the only guinea that
he had, divided it equally between her and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This is an action which in &s;ome ages would have
made a &s;aint, and perhaps in others a hero, and
which, without any hyperbolical encomiums, mu&s;t
be allowed to be an in&s;tance of uncommon gene|ro&s;ity,
an act of complicated virtue; by which he
at once relieved the poor, corrected the vicious, and
forgave an enemy; by which he at once remitted
the &s;tronge&s;t provocations, and exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t
ardent charity.</P>
<P>Compa&s;&s;ion was indeed the di&s;tingui&s;hing quality
of Savage; he never appeared inclined to take ad|vantage
of weakne&s;s, to attack the defencele&s;s, or
to pre&s;s upon the falling: whoever was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed was
certain at lea&s;t of his good wi&s;hes; and when he
could give no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to extricate them from mi&s;|fortunes,
he endeavoured to &s;ooth them by &s;ympathy
and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>But when his heart was not &s;oftened by the &s;ight
of mi&s;ery, he was &s;ometimes ob&s;tinate in his re&s;ent|ment,
and did not quickly lo&s;e the remembrance of
an injury. He always continued to &s;peak with anger
of the in&s;olence and partiality of Page, and a &s;hort
time before his death revenged it by a &s;atire<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is natural to enquire in what terms Mr. Savage
&s;poke of this fatal action, when the danger was over,
and he was under no nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing any art to
&s;et his conduct in the faire&s;t light. He was not
<PB N="xxxix" REF="44">
willing to dwell upon it, and if he tran&s;iently men|tioned
it, appeared neither to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a
murderer, nor as a man wholly free from the guilt
of blood<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In one of his letters he &s;tiles it &startq;a fatal quarrel, but too well known.&endq;</NOTE>. How much and how long he regretted
it, appeared in a<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 93.</NOTE> poem which he publi&s;hed many
years afterwards. On occa&s;ion of a copy of ver&s;es,
in which the failings of good men were recounted,
and in which the author had endeavoured to illu&s;trate
his po&s;ition, that &startq;the be&s;t may &s;ometimes deviate
from virtue,&endq; by an in&s;tance of murder committed
by Savage in the heat of wine, Savage remarked,
that it was no very ju&s;t repre&s;entation of a good man,
to &s;uppo&s;e him liable to drunkenne&s;s, and di&s;po&s;ed
in his riots to cut throats.</P>
<P>He was now indeed at liberty, but was, as before,
without any other &s;upport than accidental favours
and uncertain patronage afforded him; &s;ources by
which he was &s;ometimes very liberally &s;upplied, and
which at other times were &s;uddenly &s;topped; &s;o
that he &s;pent his life between want and plenty, or,
what was yet wor&s;e, between beggary and extra|vagance;
for as whatever he received was the gift
of chance, which might as well favour him at one
time as another, he was tempted to &s;quander what
he had, becau&s;e he always hoped to be immediately
&s;upplied.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e of his profu&s;ion was the ab&s;urd
kindne&s;s of his friends, who at once rewarded and
enjoyed his abilities, by treating him at taverns,
and habituated him to plea&s;ures which he could not
afford to enjoy, and which he was not able to deny
him&s;elf, though he purcha&s;ed the luxury of a &s;ingle
night by the angui&s;h of cold and hunger for a week.</P>
<P>The experience of the&s;e inconveniences deter|mined
him to endeavour after &s;ome &s;ettled income,
<PB N="xl" REF="45">
which, having long found &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and intreaties
fruitle&s;s, he attempted to extort from his mother by
rougher methods. He had now, a$ he acknow|ledged,
lo&s;t that tenderne&s;s for her, which the whole
&s;eries of her cruelty had not been able wholly to
repre&s;s, till he found, by the efforts which &s;he made
for his de&s;truction, that &s;he was not content with
refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and being neutial in his
&s;truggles with poverty, but was as ready to &s;natch
every opportunity of adding to his misfortunes, and
that &s;he was to be con&s;idered as an enemy implacably
malicious, whom nothing but his blood could &s;ati$fy.
He therefore threatened to hara&s;s her with lampoon$,
and to publi&s;h a copious narrative of her conduct,
unle&s;s &s;he con&s;ented to purcha&s;e an exemption from
infamy, by allowing him a pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>This expedient proved &s;ucce&s;sful. Whether &s;hame
&s;till &s;urvived, though virtue was extinct, or whether
her relations had more delicacy than her&s;elf, and
imagined that &s;ome of the darts which fatire might
point at her would glance upon them: Lord Tyr|connel,
whatever were his motives, upon his promi&s;e
to lay a&s;ide his de&s;ign of expo&s;ing the cruelty of his
mother, received him into his family, treated him
as his equal, and engaged to allow him a pen&s;ion of
two hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>This was the golden part of Mr. Savage's life;
and for &s;ome time he had no rea&s;on to complain of
fortune; his appearance was &s;plendid, his expences
large, and his acquaintance exten&s;ive. He was
courted by all who endeavoured to be thought men
of genius, and care&s;&s;ed by all who valued them&s;elves
upon a refined ta&s;te. To admire Mr. Savage was
a proof of di&s;cernment, and to be acquainted with
him was a title to poetical reputation. His pre&s;ence
was &s;ufficient to make any place of public enter|tainment
popular; and his approbation and example
<PB N="xli" REF="46">
con&s;tituted the fa&s;hion. So powerful is genius, when
it is inve&s;ted with the glitter of affluence! Men wil|lingly
pay to fortune that regard which they owe to
merit, and are plea&s;ed when they have an oppor|tunity
at once of gratifying their vanity, and prac|ti&s;ing
their duty.</P>
<P>This interval of pro&s;perity furni&s;hed him with
opportunities of enlarging his knowledge of human
nature, by contemplating life from its highe&s;t gra|dations
to its lowe&s;t, and had he afterwards applied
to dramatic poetry, he would perhaps not have had
many &s;uperiors; for as he never &s;uffered any &s;cene
to pa&s;s before his eyes without notice, he had trea|&s;ured
in his mind all the different combinations of
pa&s;&s;ions, and the innumerable mixtures of vice and
virtue, which di&s;tingui&s;h one character from another;
and as his conception was &s;trong, his expre&s;&s;ions were
clear, he ea&s;ily received impre&s;&s;ions from objects,
and very forcibly tran&s;mitted them to others.</P>
<P>Of his exact ob&s;ervations on human life he has
left a proof, which would do honour to the greate&s;t
names, in a &s;mall pamphlet, called, THE AUTHOR
TO BE LET<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 231.</NOTE>, where he introduces I&s;cariot Hackney,
a pro&s;titute &s;cribbler, giving an account of his birth,
his education, his di&s;po&s;ition and morals, habits of
life, and maxims of conduct. In the introduction
are related many &s;ecret hi&s;tories of the petty writers
of that time, but &s;ometimes mixed with ungenerous
reflections on their birth, their circum&s;tances, or
tho&s;e of their relations; nor can it be denied, that
&s;ome pa&s;&s;ages are &s;uch as I&s;cariot Hackney might
him&s;elf have produced.</P>
<P>He was accu&s;ed likewi&s;e of living in an appear|ance
of friend&s;hip with &s;ome whom he &s;atiri&s;ed, and
of making u&s;e of the confidence which he gained by
a &s;eeming kindne&s;s to di&s;cover failings and expo&s;e
them: it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that Mr. Savage's e&s;teem
<PB N="xlii" REF="47">
was no very certain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that he would
lampoon at one time tho&s;e whom he had prai&s;ed at
another.</P>
<P>It may be alleged, that the &s;ame man may change
his principles, and that he who was once de&s;ervedly
commended, may be afterwards &s;atiri&s;ed with equal
ju&s;tice, or that the poet was dazzled with the ap|pearance
of virtue, and found the man whom he had
celebrated, when he had an opportunity of examin|ing
him more nearly, unworthy of the panegyric
which he had too ha&s;tily be&s;towed; and that as a
fal&s;e &s;atire ought to be recanted, for the &s;ake of him
who&s;e reputation may be injured, fal&s;e prai&s;e ought
likewi&s;e to be obviated, le&s;t the di&s;tinction between
vice and virtue &s;hould be lo&s;t, left a bad man &s;hould
be tru&s;ted upon the credit of his encomia&s;t, or left
others &s;hould endeavour to obtain the like prai&s;es by
the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>But though the&s;e excu&s;es may be often plau&s;ible,
and &s;ometimes ju&s;t, they are very &s;eldom &s;atisfactory
to mankind; and the writer, who is not con&s;tant to
his &s;ubject, quickly &s;inks into contempt, his &s;atire
lo&s;es its force, and his panegyric its value, and he is
only con&s;idered at one time as a flatterer, and as a
calumniator at another.</P>
<P>To avoid the&s;e imputations, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to
follow the rules of virtue, and to pre&s;erve an unva|ried
regard to truth. For though it is undoubtedly
po&s;&s;ible, that a man, however cautious, may be &s;ome|times
deceived by an artful appearance of virtue, or
by fal&s;e evidences of guilt, &s;uch errors will not be
frequent; and it will be allowed, that the name of
an author would never have been made contemptible,
had no man ever &s;aid what he did not think, or mi&s;|led
others, but when he was him&s;elf deceived.</P>
<P>If THE AUTHOR TO BE LET was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in a
&s;ingle pamphlet, and afterwards in&s;erted in a collec|tion
<PB N="xliii" REF="48">
of pieces relating to the Dunciad, which were ad|dre&s;&s;ed
by Mr. Savage to the Earl of Middle&s;ex, in a
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 233.</NOTE>dedication which he was prevailed upon to &s;ign, tho'
he did not write it, and in which there are &s;ome po&s;i|tions,
that the true author would perhaps not have
publi&s;hed under his own name, and on which Mr.
Savage afterwards reflected with no great &s;atisfaction;
the enumeration of the bad effects of the uncon|trolled
freedom of the pre&s;s, and the a&s;&s;ertion that
the &startq;Liberties taken by the writers of Journals with
&punc;their &s;uperiors were exorbitant and unju&s;tifiable,&endq;
very ill became men, who have them&s;elves not al|ways
&s;hewn the exacte&s;t regard to the laws of &s;ubor|dination
in their writing, and who have often &s;ati|ri&s;ed
tho&s;e that at lea&s;t thought them&s;elves their &s;u|periors,
as they were eminent for their hereditary
rank, and employed in the highe&s;t offices of the king|dom.
But this is only an in&s;tance of that partiality
which almo&s;t every man indulges with regard to him|&s;elf;
the liberty of the pre&s;s is a ble&s;&s;ing when we
are inclined to write again&s;t others, and a calamity
when we find our&s;elves overborn by the multitude of
our a&s;&s;ailants; as the power of the crown is always
thought too great by tho&s;e who &s;uffer by its influ|ence,
and too little by tho&s;e in who&s;e favour it is
exerted; and a &s;tanding army is generally accounted
nece&s;&s;ary by tho&s;e who command, and dangerous
and oppre&s;&s;ive by tho&s;e who &s;upport it.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage was likewi&s;e very far from believing,
that the letters annexed to each &s;pecies of bad poets
in the Bathos, were, as he was directed to a&s;&s;ert,
&startq;&s;et down at random;&endq; for when he was charged by
one of his friends with putting his name to &s;uch an
improbability, he had no other an&s;wer to make, than
that &startq;he did not think of it,&endq; and his friend had too
much tenderne&s;s to reply, that next to the crime of
<PB N="xliv" REF="49">
writing contrary to what he thought, was that of
writing without thinking.</P>
<P>After having remarked what is fal&s;e in this dedi|cation,
it is proper that I ob&s;erve the impartiality
which I recommend, by declaring what Savage a&s;|&s;erted,
that the account of the circum&s;tances which
attended the publication of the Dunciad, however
&s;trange and improbable, was exactly true.</P>
<P>The publication of this piece at this time rai&s;ed
Mr. Savage a great number of enemies among tho&s;e
that were attacked by Mr. Pope, with whom he was
con&s;idered as a kind of confederate, and whom he
was &s;u&s;pected of &s;upplying with private intelligence
and &s;ecret incidents: &s;o that the ignominy of an in|former
was added to the te$$or of a &s;atiri&s;t.</P>
<P>That he was not altogether free from literary
hypocri&s;y, and that he &s;ometimes &s;poke one thing,
and wrote another, cannot be denied; becau&s;e he
him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed, that when he lived in great fami|liarity
with Dennis, he wrote an epigram<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>This epigram was, I believe, never publi&s;hed.</P>
<LG>
<L>Should Dennis publi&s;h you had &s;tabb'd your brother,</L>
<L>Lampoon'd your monarch, or debauch'd your mother;</L>
<L>Say what revenge on Dennis can be had,</L>
<L>Too dull for laughter, for reply too mad?</L>
<L>On one &s;o poor you cannot take the law,</L>
<L>On one &s;o old your &s;word you &s;corn to draw:</L>
<L>Uncag'd, then, let the harmle&s;s mon&s;ter race,</L>
<L>Secure in dulne&s;s, madne&s;s, want, and age.</L>
</LG></NOTE> again&s;t
him.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage however &s;et all the malice of all the
pigmy writers at defiance, and thought the friend|&s;hip
of Mr. Pope cheaply purcha&s;ed by being ex|po&s;ed
to their cen&s;ure and their hatred; nor had he
any rea&s;on to repent of the preference, for he found
Mr. Pope a &s;teady and unalienable friend almo&s;t to
the end of his life.</P>
<P><PB N="xlv" REF="50">
About this time, notwith&s;tanding his avowed neu|trality
with regard to party, he publi&s;hed a panegyric
on Sir Robert Walpole, for which he was rewarded
by him with twenty guineas, a &s;um not very large,
if either the excellence of the performance, or the
affluence of the patron be con&s;idered; but greater
than he afterwards obtained from a per&s;on of yet
higher rank, and more de&s;irous in appearance of be|ing
di&s;tingui&s;hed as a patron of literature.</P>
<P>As he was very far from approving the conduct of
Sir Robert Walpole, and in conver&s;ation mentioned
him &s;ometimes with acrimony, and generally with
contempt; as he was one of tho&s;e who were always
zealous in their a&s;&s;ertions of the ju&s;tice of the late
oppo&s;ition, jealous of the rights of the people, and
alarmed by the long-continued triumph of the court;
it was natural to a&s;k him what could induce him to
employ his poetry in prai&s;e of that man who was, in
his opinion, an enemy to liberty, and an oppre&s;&s;or
of his country? He alleged, that he was then de|pendent
upon the Lord Tyrconnel, who was an im|plicit
follower of the mini&s;try, and that being en|joined
by him, not without menaces, to write in
prai&s;e of his leader, he had not re&s;olution &s;ufficient
to &s;acrifice the plea&s;ure of affluence to that of in|tegrity.</P>
<P>On this, and on many other occa&s;ions, he was
ready to lament the mi&s;ery of living at the tables of
other men, which was his fate from the beginning
to the end of his life; for I know not whether he
ever had, for three months together, a &s;ettled habi|tation,
in which he could claim a right of re&s;idence.</P>
<P>To this unhappy &s;tate it is ju&s;t to impute much of
the incon&s;tancy of his conduct; for though a readi|ne&s;s
to comply with the inclination of others was no
part of his natural character, yet he was &s;ometimes
obliged to relax his ob&s;tinacy, and &s;ubmit his own
<PB N="xlvi" REF="51">
judgment and even his virtue to the government of
tho&s;e by whom he was &s;upported: &s;o that if his mi|&s;eries
were &s;ometimes the con&s;equences of his faults,
he ought not yet to be wholly excluded from com|pa&s;&s;ion,
becau&s;e his faults were very often the effects
of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>In this gay period<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1729.</NOTE> of his life, while he was &s;ur|rounded
by affluence and plea&s;ure, he publi&s;hed THE
WANDERER, a moral Poem, of which the de&s;ign is
compri&s;ed in the&s;e lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>I fly all public care, all venal &s;trife,</L>
<L>To try the &s;till, compar'd with active life;</L>
<L>To prove, by the&s;e the &s;ons of men may owe</L>
<L>The fruits of bli&s;s to bur&s;ting clouds of woe;</L>
<L>That e'en calamity, by thought refin'd,</L>
<L>In&s;pirits and adorns the thanking mind.</L>
</LG>
<P>And more di&s;tinctly in the following pa&s;&s;age:</P>
<LG>
<L>By woe, the &s;oul to daring action &s;wells;</L>
<L>By woe, in plaintle&s;s patience it excels;</L>
<L>From patience, prudent clear experience &s;prings,</L>
<L>And traces knowledge thro' the cour&s;e of things!</L>
<L>Thence hope is form'd, thence fortitude, &s;ucce&s;s,</L>
<L>Renown:&mdash;whate'er men covet and care&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<P>This performance was always con&s;idered by him|&s;elf
as his ma&s;ter-piece; and Mr. Pope, when he
a&s;ked his opinion of it, told him, that he read it
once over, and was not di&s;plea&s;ed with it, that it
gave him more plea&s;ure at the &s;econd peru&s;al, and
delighted him &s;till more at the third.</P>
<P>It has been generally objected to THE WANDERER,
that the di&s;po&s;ition of the parts is irregular, that the
de&s;ign is ob&s;cure, and the plan perplexed; that the
<PB N="xlvii" REF="52">
images, however beautiful, &s;ucceed each other with|out
order; and that the whole performance is not &s;o
much a regular fabric, as a heap of &s;hining mate|rials
thrown together by accident, which &s;trikes
rather with the &s;olemn magnificence of a &s;tupendous
ruin, than the elegant grandeur of a fini&s;hed pile.</P>
<P>This critici&s;m is univer&s;al, and therefore it is
rea&s;onable to believe it at lea&s;t in a great degree
ju&s;t; but Mr. Savage was always of a contrary
opinion, and thought his drift could only be mi&s;&s;ed
by negligence or &s;tupidity, and that the whole plan
was regular, and the parts di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>It was never denied to abound with &s;trong repre|&s;entations
of nature, and ju&s;t ob&s;ervations upon life,
and it may ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of his pic|tures
have an evident tendency to illu&s;trate his fir&s;t
great po&s;ition, &startq;that good is the con&s;equence of
evil.&endq; The &s;un that burns up the mountains,
fructifies the vales; the deluge that ru&s;hes down the
broken rocks with dreadful impetuo&s;ity, is &s;eparated
into purling brooks; and the rage of the hurricane
purifies the air.</P>
<P>Even in this poem he has not been able to forbear
one touch upon the cruelty of his mother<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol II. p. $$</NOTE>, which,
though remarkably delicate and tender, is a proof
how deep an impre&s;&s;ion it had upon his mind.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be at lea&s;t acknowledged, which ought
to be thought equivalent to many other excellencies,
that this poem can promote no other purpo&s;es than
tho&s;e of virtue, and that it is written with a very
&s;trong &s;en&s;e of the efficacy of religion.</P>
<P>But my province is rather to give the hi&s;tory of
Mr. Savage's performances, than to di&s;play their
beauties, or to ob$$$te the critici&s;ms which they
have occa&s;ioned, and therefore I &s;hall not dwell upon
<PB N="xlviii" REF="53">
the particular pa&s;&s;ages which de&s;erve applau&s;e: I
&s;hall neither &s;how the excellence of his de&s;criptions<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 59.</NOTE>,
nor expatiate on the terrific portrait of &s;uicide<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">$word$</NOTE>,
nor point out the artful touches<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Ibid. p. 7$.</NOTE>, by whic$ $e has
di&s;tingui&s;hed the intellectual features of the rebels,
who &s;uffer death in his la&s;t canto. It is, however,
proper to ob&s;erve, that Mr. Savage always declared
the characters wholly fictitious, and without the lea&s;t
allu&s;ion to any real per&s;ons or actions.</P>
<P>From a poem &s;o diligently laboured, and &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
fini&s;hed, it might be rea&s;onably expected
that he &s;hould have gained con&s;iderable advantage;
nor can it, without &s;ome degree of indignation and
concern, be told, that he &s;old the copy for ten gui|neas,
of which he afterwards returned two, that the
two la&s;t &s;heets of the work might be reprinted, of
which he had in his ab&s;ence intru&s;ted the correction
to a friend, who was too indolent to perform it with
accuracy.</P>
<P>A &s;uper&s;titious regard to the correction of his
&s;heets was one of Mr. Savage's peculiarities: he
often altered, revi&s;ed, recurred to his fir&s;t reading
or punctuation, and again adopted the alteration;
he was dubious and irre&s;olute without end, as on
a que&s;tion of the la&s;t importance, and at la&s;t was
&s;eldom &s;atisfied: the intru&s;ion or omi&s;&s;ion of a com|ma
was &s;ufficient to di&s;compo&s;e him, and he would
lament an error of a &s;ingle letter as a heavy cala|mity.
In one of his letter relating to an impre&s;&s;ion
of &s;ome ver&s;es, he remarks, that he had, with regard
to the correction of the proof. &startq;a &s;pell upon him;&endq;
and indeed the anxiety, with which he dwelt upon
the minute&s;t and mo&s;t trifling nicetie$, de&s;erved no
other name than that of fa&s;ci$ation.</P>
<P>That he &s;old &s;o valuable a performance for &s;o
&s;mall a price was not to be imputed either to nece&s;|&s;ity,
<PB N="xlix" REF="54">
by which the learned and ingenious are often
obliged to &s;ubmit to very hard conditions, or to
avarice, by which the book&s;ellers are frequently in|cited
to oppre&s;s that genius by which they are &s;up|ported,
but to that intemperate de&s;ire of plea&s;ure,
and habitual &s;lavery to his pa&s;&s;ions, which involved
him in many perplexities; he happened at that time
to be engaged in the pur&s;uit of &s;ome trifling grati|fication,
and being without money for the pre&s;ent
occa&s;ion, &s;old his poem to the fir&s;t bidder, and per|h$p$
for the fir&s;t price that was propo&s;ed, and would
probably have been content with le&s;s, if le&s;s had
been offered him.</P>
<P>This poem was addre&s;&s;ed to the Lord Tyrconnel
not only in the fir&s;t lines<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 7.</NOTE>, but in a formal dedication
filled with the highe&s;t &s;trains of panegyric, and the
war$ne&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude, but by no means
remarkable for delicacy of connection or elegance of
&s;tile.</P>
<P>The&s;e prai&s;es in a &s;hort time he found him&s;elf
inclined to retract, being di&s;carded by the man on
whom he had be&s;towed them, and whom he then
immediately di&s;covered not to have de&s;erved them.
Of this quarrel, which every day made more bitter,
Lord Tyrconnel and Mr. Savage a&s;&s;igned very dif|ferent
rea&s;ons, which might perhaps all in reality
concur, though they were not all convenient to be
alleged by either party. Lord Tyrconnel affirmed,
that it was the con&s;tant practice of Mr. Savage to
enter a tavern with any company that propo&s;ed it,
drink the mo&s;t expen&s;ive wines with great profu&s;ion,
and when the reckoning was demanded, to be with|out
money: If, as it often happened, his company
were willing to defray his part, the affair ended,
without any ill con&s;equences; but if they were re|fractory,
<PB N="l" REF="55">
and expected that the wine &s;hould be paid
for by him that drank it, his method of compo&s;ition
was, to take them with him to his own apartment,
a&s;&s;ume the government of the hou&s;e, and order the
butler in an imperious manner to &s;et the be&s;t wine in
the cellar before his company, who often drank till
they forgot the re&s;pect due to the hou&s;e in which
they were entertained, indulged them&s;elves in the
utmo&s;t extravagance of merriment, practi&s;ed the
mo&s;t licentious frolics, and committed all the out|rages
of drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor was this the only charge which Lord Tyr|connel
brought again&s;t him: Having given him a
collection of valuable books, &s;tamped with his own
arms, he had the mortification to &s;ee them in a &s;hort
time expo&s;ed to &s;ale upon the &s;talls, it being u&s;ual
with Mr. Savage, when he wanted a &s;mall &s;um, to
take his books to the pawnbroker.</P>
<P>Whoever was acquainted with Mr. Savage ea&s;ily
credited both the&s;e accu&s;ations; for having been
obliged from his fir&s;t entrance into the world to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t
upon expedients, affluence was not able to exalt
him above them; and &s;o much was he delighted
with wine and conver&s;ation, and &s;o long had he
been accu&s;tomed to live by chance, that he would at
any time go to the tavern without &s;cruple, and tru&s;t
for his reckoning to the liberality of his company,
and frequently of company to whom he was very
little known. This conduct indeed very &s;eldom
drew upon him tho&s;e inconveniences that might be
feared by any other per&s;on; for his conver&s;ation was
&s;o entertaining, and his addre&s;s &s;o plea&s;ing, that
few thought the plea&s;ure which they received from
him dearly purcha&s;ed, by paying for his wine. It
was his peculiar happine&s;s, that he &s;carcely ever
found a &s;tranger, whom he did not leave a friend;
but it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be added, that he had not often
<PB N="li" REF="56">
a friend long, without obliging him to become a
&s;tranger.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage, on the other hand, declared, that
Lord Tyrconnel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">His expre&s;&s;ion in one of his letters, was, &startq;that Lord T&mdash;I&punc; had involved his e&s;tate, and therefore poorly &s;ought an occa&s;ion to quarrel with him.&endq;</NOTE> quarrelled with him, becau&s;e he
would &s;ub&s;tract from his own luxury and extrava|gance
what he had promi&s;ed to allow him, and that
his re&s;entment was only a plea for the violation of
his promi&s;e: He a&s;&s;erted, that he had done nothing
that ought to exclude him from that &s;ub&s;i&s;tence which
he thought not &s;o much a favour, as a debt, &s;ince
it was offered him upon conditions, which he had
never broken; and that his only fault was, that he
could not be &s;upported with nothing.</P>
<P>He acknowledged, that Lord Tyrconnel often
exhorted him to regulate his method of life, and
not to &s;pend all his nights in taverns, and that he
appeared very de&s;irous, that he would pa&s;s tho&s;e
hours with him, which he &s;o freely be&s;towed upon
others. This demand Mr. Savage con&s;idered as a
cen&s;ure of his conduct, which he could never pa|tiently
bear; and which in the latter and cooler part
of his life was &s;o offen&s;ive to him, that he declared
it as his re&s;olution, &startq;to &s;purn that friend who &s;hould
pre&s;ume to dictate to him;&endq; and it is not likely,
that in his earlier years he received admonitions with
more calmne&s;s.</P>
<P>He was likewi&s;e inclined to re&s;ent &s;uch expecta|tions,
as tending to infringe his liberty, of which
he was very jealous, when it was nece&s;&s;ary to the
gratification of his pa&s;&s;ions, and declared, that the
reque&s;t was &s;till more unrea&s;onable, as the company
to which he was to have been confined was in&s;up|portably
di&s;agreeable. This a&s;&s;ertion affords another
<PB N="lii" REF="57">
in&s;tance of that incon&s;i&s;tency of his writings with
his conver&s;ation, which was &s;o often to be ob&s;erved.
He forgot how lavi&s;hly he had, in his<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 3.</NOTE> Dedication
to THE WANDERER, extolled the delicacy and pe|netration,
the humanity and genero&s;ity, the candour
and politene&s;s of the man, whom, when he no
longer loved him, he declared to be a wretch with|out
under&s;tanding, without goodnature, and without
ju&s;tice; of who&s;e name he thought him&s;elf obliged
to leave no trace in any future edition of his wri|tings;
and accordingly blotted it out of that copy
of THE WANDERER which was in his hands.</P>
<P>During his continuance with the Lord Tyrconnel,
he wrote<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 99.</NOTE> THE TRIUMPH OF HEALTH AND
MIRTH, on the recovery of Lady Tyrconnel from
a langui&s;hing illne&s;s. This performance is remark|able,
not only for the gaiety of the ideas, and the
melody of the numbers, but for the agreeable fiction
upon which it is formed. Mirth, overwhelmed with
&s;orrow for the &s;ickne&s;s of her favourite, takes a flight
in que&s;t of her &s;i&s;ter Health, whom &s;he finds reclined
upon the brow of a lo&s;ty mountain, amid&s;t the fra|grance
of perpetual &s;pring, with the breezes of the
morning &s;porting about her. Being &s;olicited by her
&s;i&s;ter Mirth, &s;he readily promi&s;es her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, flies
away in a cloud, and impregnates the waters of
Bath with new virtues, by which the &s;ickne&s;s of
Belinda is relieved.</P>
<P>As the reputation of his abilities, the particular
circum&s;tances of his birth and life, the &s;plendour of
his appearance, and the di&s;tinction which was for
&s;ome time paid him by Lord Tyrconnel, intitled
him to familiarity with per&s;ons of higher rank, than
tho&s;e to who&s;e conver&s;ation he had been before ad|mitted,
he did not fail to gratify that curio&s;ity,
<PB N="liii" REF="58">
which induced him to take a nearer view of tho&s;e
whom their birth, their employments, or their for|tunes,
nece&s;&s;arily place at a di&s;tance from the greate&s;t
part of mankind, and to examine whether their
merit was magnified or dimini&s;hed by the medium
through which it was contemplated; whether the
&s;plendour with which they dazzled their admirers
was inherent in them&s;elves, or only reflected on
them by the objects that &s;urrounded them; and
whether great men were &s;elected for high &s;tations,
or high &s;tations made great men.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he took all opportunities of con|ver&s;ing
familiarly with tho&s;e who were mo&s;t con|&s;picuous
at that time for their power or their influ|ence;
he watched their loo&s;er moments, and exa|mined
their dome&s;tic behaviour with that acutene&s;s
which nature had given him, and which the un|common
variety of his life had contributed to in|crea&s;e,
and that inqui&s;itivene&s;s which mu&s;t always
be produced in a vigorous mind, by an ab&s;olute free|dom
from all pre&s;&s;ing or dome&s;tic engagements.
His di&s;cernment was quick, and therefore he &s;oon
found in every per&s;on, and in every affair, &s;ome|thing
that de&s;erved attention; he was &s;upported by
others, without any care for him&s;elf, and was there|fore
at lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue his ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>More circum&s;tances to con&s;titute a critic on hu|man
life could not ea&s;ily concur, nor indeed could
any man, who a&s;&s;umed from accidental advantages
more prai&s;e than he could ju&s;tly claim from his real
merit, admit an acquaintance more dangerous than
that of Savage; of whom likewi&s;e it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that abilities really exalted above the com|mon
level, or virtue refined from pa&s;&s;ion, or proof
again&s;t corruption, could not ea&s;ily find an abler
judge, or a warmer advocate.</P>
<P><PB N="liv" REF="59">
What was the re&s;ult of Mr. Savage's enquiry,
though he was not much accu&s;tomed to conceal his
di&s;coveries, it may not be entirely &s;afe to relate,
becau&s;e the per&s;ons who&s;e characters he critici&s;ed are
powerful; and power and re&s;entment are &s;eldom
&s;trangers; nor would it perhaps be wholly ju&s;t, be|cau&s;e
what he a&s;&s;erted in conver&s;ation might, though
true in general, be heightened by &s;ome momentary
ardour of imagination, and as it can be delivered
only from memory, may be imperfectly repre&s;ented;
&s;o that the picture at fir&s;t aggravated, and then un|&s;kilfully
copied, may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected to retain no
great re&s;emblance of the original.</P>
<P>It may however be ob&s;erved, that he did not ap|pear
to have formed very elevated ideas of tho&s;e to
whom the admini&s;tration of affairs, or the conduct
of parties, has been intru&s;ted; who have been con|&s;idered
as the advocates of the crown, or the guar|dians
of the people, and who have obtained the
mo&s;t implicit confidence, and the loude&s;t applau&s;es.
Of one particular per&s;on, who has been at one time
&s;o popular as to be generally e&s;teemed, and at an|other
&s;o formidable as to be univer&s;ally dete&s;ted, he
ob&s;erved, that his acqui&s;itions had been &s;mall, or
that his capacity was narrow, and that the whole
range of his mind was from ob&s;cenity to politics,
and from politics to ob&s;cenity.</P>
<P>But the opportunity of indulging his &s;peculations
on great characters was now at an end. He was ba|ni&s;hed
from the table of Lord Tyrconnel, and turned
again adrift upon the world, without pro&s;pect of find|ing
quickly any other harbour. As prudence was
not one of the virtues by which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed,
he had made no provi&s;ion again&s;t a misfortune like
this. And though it is not to be imagined, but that
the &s;eparation mu&s;t for &s;ome time have been pre|ceded
by coldne&s;s, peevi&s;hne&s;s, or neglect, though
<PB N="lv" REF="60">
it was undoubtedly the con&s;equence of accumulated
provocations on both &s;ides, yet every one that knew
Savage will readily believe, that to him it was &s;udden
as a &s;troke of thunder; that though he might have
tran&s;iently &s;u&s;pected it, he had never &s;uffered any
thought &s;o unplea&s;ing to &s;ink into his mind, but that
he had driven it away by amu&s;ements, or dreams of
future felicity and affluence, and had never taken
any mea&s;ures by which he might prevent a precipi|tation
from plenty to indigence.</P>
<P>This quarrel and &s;eparation, and the difficulties
to which Mr. Savage was expo&s;ed by them, were
&s;oon known both to his friends and enemies; nor
was it long before he perceived, from the behaviour
of both, how much is added to the lu&s;tre of genius,
by the ornaments of wealth.</P>
<P>His condition did not appear to excite much com|pa&s;&s;ion;
for he had not always been careful to u&s;e
the advantages he enjoyed with that moderation,
which ought to have been with more than u&s;ual cau|tion
pre&s;erved by him, who knew, if he had reflected,
that he was only a dependant on the bounty of an|other,
whom he could expect to &s;upport him no
longer than he endeavoured to pre&s;erve his favour,
by complying with his inclinations, and whom he
neverthele&s;s &s;et at defiance, and was continually irri|tating
by negligence or encroachments.</P>
<P>Examples need not be &s;ought at any great di&s;tance
to prove, that &s;uperiority of fortune has a natural
tendency to kindle pride, and that pride &s;eldom fails
to exert it&s;elf in contempt and in&s;ult; and if this is
often the effect of hereditary wealth, and of honours
enjoyed only by the merit of others, it is &s;ome ex|tenuation
of any indecent triumphs to which this
unhappy man may have been betrayed, that his
pro&s;perity was heightened, by the force of novelty,
and made more intoxicating by a &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;ery
<PB N="lvi" REF="61">
in which he had &s;o long langui&s;hed, and perhaps of
the in&s;ults which he had formerly borne, and which
he might now think him&s;elf entitled to revenge. It
is too common for tho&s;e who have unju&s;tly &s;uffered
pain, to inflict it likewi&s;e in their turn, with the
&s;ame inju&s;tice, and to imagine that they have a right
to treat others as they have them&s;elves been treated.</P>
<P>That Mr. Savage was too much elevated by any
good fortune, is generally known; and &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages
of his Introduction to THE AUTHOR TO BE LET &s;uf|ficiently
&s;hew, that he did not wholly refrain from
&s;uch &s;atire as he afterwards thought very unju&s;t,
when he was expo&s;ed to it him&s;elf; for when he was
afterwards ridiculed in the character of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
poet, he very ea&s;ily di&s;covered, that di&s;tre&s;s was not
a proper &s;ubject for merriment, or topic of invective.
He was then able to di&s;cern, that if mi&s;ery be the
effect of virtue, it ought to be reverenced; if of ill-fortune,
to be pitied; and if of vice, not to be in|&s;ulted,
becau&s;e it is perhaps it&s;elf a puni&s;hment ad|equate
to the crime by which it was produced. And
the humanity of that man can de&s;erve no panegyric,
who is capable of reproaching a criminal in the
hands of the executioner.</P>
<P>But the&s;e reflections, though they readily occurred
to him in the fir&s;t and la&s;t parts of his life, were, I
am afraid, for a long time forgotten; at lea&s;t they
were, like many other maxims, trea&s;ured up in his
mind, rather for &s;hew than u&s;e, and operated very
little upon his conduct, however elegantly he might
&s;ometimes explain, or however forcibly he might in|culcate
them.</P>
<P>His degradation therefore from the condition which
he had enjoyed with &s;uch wanton thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, was
con&s;idered by many as an occa&s;ion of triumph. Tho&s;e
who had before paid their court to him, without &s;uc|ce&s;s,
&s;oon returned the contempt which they had
<PB N="lvii" REF="62">
&s;uffered, and they who had received favours from
him, for of &s;uch favours as he could be&s;tow he was
very liberal, did not always remember them. So
much more certain are the effects of re&s;entment than
of gratitude: it is not only to many more plea&s;ing
to recollect tho&s;e faults which place others below
them, than tho&s;e virtues by which they are them|&s;elves
comparatively depre&s;&s;ed; but it is likewi&s;e
more ea&s;y to neglect, than to recompen&s;e; and tho'
there are few who will practi&s;e a laborious virtue,
there will never be wanting multitudes that will in|dulge
an ea&s;y vice.</P>
<P>Savage however was very little di&s;turbed at the
marks of contempt which is ill-fortune brought upon
him, from tho&s;e whom he never e&s;teemed, and with
whom he never con&s;idered him&s;elf as levelled by any
calamities; and though it was not without &s;ome un|ea&s;ine&s;s
that he &s;aw &s;ome, who&s;e friend&s;hip he va|lued,
change their behaviour; he yet ob&s;erved their
coldne&s;s without much emotion, con&s;idered them as
the &s;laves of fortune and the wor&s;hippers of pro&s;pe|rity;
and was more inclined to de&s;pi&s;e them, than
to lament him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It does not appear, that after this return of his
wants, he found mankind equally favourable to him,
as at his fir&s;t appearance in the world. His &s;tory,
though in reality not le&s;s melancholy, was le&s;s af|fecting,
becau&s;e it was no longer new; it therefore
procured him no new friends, and tho&s;e that had
formerly relieved him thought they might now con|&s;ign
him to others. He was now likewi&s;e con&s;idered
by many rather as criminal, than as unhappy; for
the friends of Lord Tyrconnel, and of his mother,
were &s;ufficiently indu&s;trious to publi&s;h his weakne&s;&s;es,
which were indeed very numerous, and nothing was
forgotten, that might make him either hateful or ri|diculous.</P>
<P><PB N="lviii" REF="63">
It cannot but be imagined, that &s;uch repre&s;enta|tions
of his faults mu&s;t make great numbers le&s;s &s;en|&s;ible
of his di&s;tre&s;s; many who had only an oppor|tunity
to hear one part, made no &s;cruple to propa|gate
the account which they received; many a&s;&s;i&s;ted
their circulation from malice or revenge, and perhaps many pre|tended
to credit them, that they
might with a better grace withdraw their regard, or
withhold their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Savage however was not one of tho&s;e, who &s;uffered
him&s;elf to be injured without re&s;i&s;tance, nor was le&s;s
diligent in expo&s;ing the faults of Lord Tyrconnel,
over whom he obtained at lea&s;t this advantage, that
he drove him fir&s;t to the practice of outrage and vio|lence;
for he was &s;o much provoked by the wit and
virulence of Savage, that he came with a number of
attendants, that did no honour to his courage, to
beat him at a coffee-hou&s;e. But it happened that he
had left the place a few minutes, and his lord&s;hip
had without danger the plea&s;ure of boa&s;ting, how he
would have treated him. Mr. Savage went next day
to repay his vi&s;it at his own hou&s;e, but was prevailed
on by his dome&s;tics, to retire without in&s;i&s;ting upon
&s;eeing him.</P>
<P>Lord Tyrconnel was accu&s;ed by Mr. Savage of
&s;ome actions, which &s;carcely any provocations will
be thought &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify; &s;uch as &s;eizing what
he had in his lodgings, and other in&s;tances of wan|ton
cruelty, by which he encrea&s;ed the di&s;tre&s;s of
Savage, without any advantage to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e mutual accu&s;ations were retorted on both
&s;ides for many years, with the utmo&s;t degree of viru|lence
and rage, and time &s;eemed rather to augment
than dimini&s;h their re&s;entment. That the anger of
Mr. Savage &s;hould be kept alive is not &s;trange, be|cau&s;e
he felt every day the con&s;equences of the quar|rel;
but it might rea&s;onably have been hoped, that
<PB N="lix" REF="64">
Lord Tyrconnel might have relented, and at length
have forgot tho&s;e provocations, which, however they
might have once inflamed him, had not in reality
much hurt him.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of Mr. Savage indeed never &s;uffered
him to &s;olicit a reconciliation; he returned reproach
for reproach, and in&s;ult for in&s;ult; his &s;uperiority
of wit &s;upplied the di&s;advantages of his fortune, and
enabled him to form a party, and prejudice great
numbers in his favour.</P>
<P>But though this might be &s;ome gratification of his
vanity, it afforded very little relief to his nece&s;&s;ities,
and he was very frequently reduced to uncommon
hard&s;hips, of which, however, he never made any
mean or importunate complaints, being formed ra|ther
to bear mi&s;ery with fortitude, than enjoy pro|&s;perity
with moderation.</P>
<P>He now thought him&s;elf again at liberty to ex|po&s;e
the cruelty of his mother, and therefore, I be|lieve,
about this time, publi&s;hed THE BASTARD, a
poem remarkable for the vivacious &s;allies of thought
in the beginning<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 91.</NOTE>, where he makes a pompous enu|meration
of the imaginary advantages of ba&s;e birth,
and the pathetic &s;entiments at the end, where he
recounts the real calamities which he &s;uffered by the
crime of his parents.</P>
<P>The vigour and &s;pirit of the ver&s;es, the peculiar
circum&s;tances of the author, the novelty of the &s;ub|ject,
and the notoriety of the &s;tory, to which the
allu&s;ions are made, procured this performance a very
favourable reception; great numbers were imme|diately
di&s;per&s;ed, and editions were multiplied with
unu&s;ual rapidity.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance attended the publication, which
Savage u&s;ed to relate with great &s;atisfaction. His
<PB N="lx" REF="65">
mother, to whom the poem was with &startq;due reverence&endq;
in&s;cribed, happened then to be at Bath, where &s;he
could not conveniently retire from cen&s;ure, or con|ceal
her&s;elf from ob&s;ervation; and no &s;ooner did the
reputation of the poem begin to &s;pread, than &s;he
heard it repeated in all places of concour&s;e, nor
could &s;he enter the a&s;&s;embly-rooms, or cro&s;s the
walks, without being &s;aluted with &s;ome lines from
THE BASTARD.</P>
<P>This was perhaps the fir&s;t time that ever &s;he di&s;|covered
a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and on this occa&s;ion the
power of wit was very con&s;picuous; the wretch who
had, without &s;cruple, proclaimed her&s;elf an adul|tere&s;s,
and who had fir&s;t endeavoured to &s;tarve her
&s;on, then to tran&s;port him, and afterwards to hang
him, was not able to bear the repre&s;entation of her
own conduct, but fled from reproach, though &s;he
felt no pain from guilt, and left Bath with the utmo&s;t
ha&s;te, to &s;helter her&s;elf among the crowds of Lon|don.</P>
<P>Thus Savage had the &s;atisfaction of finding, that
though he could not reform his mother, he could
puni&s;h her, and that he did not always &s;uffer alone.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure which he received from this increa&s;e
of his poetical reputation, was &s;ufficient for &s;ome
time to overbalance the mi&s;eries of want, which
this performance did not much alleviate, for it was
&s;old for a very trivial &s;um to a book&s;eller, who,
though the &s;ucce&s;s was &s;o uncommon, that five im|pre&s;&s;ions
were &s;old, of which many were undoubtedly
very numerous, had not genero&s;ity &s;ufficient to ad|mit
the unhappy writer to any part of the profit.</P>
<P>The &s;ale of this poem was always mentioned by
Savage with the utmo&s;t elevation of heart, and re|ferred
to by him as an inconte&s;table proof of a ge|neral
acknowledgment of his abilities. It was in|deed
<PB N="lxi" REF="66">
the only production of which he could ju&s;tly
boa&s;t a general reception.</P>
<P>But though he did not lo&s;e the opportunity which
&s;ucce&s;s gave him of &s;etting a high rate on his abi|lities,
but paid due deference to the &s;uffrages of
mankind when they were given in his favour, he
did not &s;uffer his e&s;teem of him&s;elf to depend upon
others, nor found any thing &s;acred in the voice of
the people when they were inclined to cen&s;ure him;
he then readily &s;hewed the folly of expecting that
the public &s;hould judge right, ob&s;erved how &s;lowly
poetical merit had often forced its way into the
world; he contented him&s;elf with the applau&s;e of
men of judgment, and was &s;omewhat di&s;po&s;ed to
exclude all tho&s;e from the character of men of judg|ment,
who did not applaud him.</P>
<P>But he was at other times more favourable to
mankind, than to think them blind to the beauties
of his works, and imputed the &s;lowne&s;s of their &s;ale
to other cau&s;es; either they were publi&s;hed at a time
when the town was empty, or when the attention of
the public was engro&s;&s;ed by &s;ome &s;truggle in the
parliament, or &s;ome other object of general concern;
or they were by the neglect of the publi&s;her not
diligently di&s;per&s;ed, or by his avarice not adverti&s;ed
with &s;ufficient frequency. Addre&s;s, or indu&s;try, or
liberality, was always wanting; and the blame was
laid rather on any other per&s;on than the author.</P>
<P>By arts like the&s;e, arts which every man practi&s;es
in &s;ome degree, and to which too much of the little
tranquillity of life is to be a&s;cribed, Savage was
always able to live at peace with him&s;elf. Had he
indeed only made u&s;e of the&s;e expedients to alleviate
the lo&s;s or want of fortune or reputation, or any
other advantages, which it is not in man's power to
be&s;tow upon him&s;elf, they might have been ju&s;tly
mentioned as in&s;tances of a philo&s;ophical mind, and
<PB N="lxii" REF="67">
very properly propo&s;ed to the imitation of multitudes,
who, for want of diverting their imaginations with
the &s;ame dexterity, langui&s;h under afflictions which
might be ea&s;ily removed.</P>
<P>It were doubtle&s;s to be wi&s;hed, that truth and
rea&s;on were univer&s;ally prevalent; that every thing
were e&s;teemed according to its real value; and that
men would &s;ecure them&s;elves from being di&s;appointed
in their endeavours after happine&s;s, by placing it
only in virtue, which is always to be obtained; but
if adventitious and foreign plea&s;ures mu&s;t be pur|&s;ued,
it would be perhaps of &s;ome benefit, &s;ince
that pur&s;uit mu&s;t frequently be fruitle&s;s, if the prac|tice
of Savage could be taught, that folly might be
an antidote to folly, and one fallacy be obviated by
another.</P>
<P>But the danger of this plea&s;ing intoxication mu&s;t
not be concealed; nor indeed can any one, after
having ob&s;erved the life of Savage, need to be cau|tioned
again&s;t it. By imputing none of his mi&s;eries
to him&s;elf, he continued to act upon the &s;ame prin|ciples,
and to follow the &s;ame path; was never made
wi&s;er by his &s;ufferings, nor pre&s;erved by one mi&s;|fortune
from falling into another. He proceeded
throughout his life to tread the &s;ame &s;teps on the
&s;ame circle; always applauding his pa&s;t conduct, or
at lea&s;t forgetting it, to amu&s;e him&s;elf with phan|toms
of happine&s;s, which were dancing before him;
and willingly turned his eyes from the light of
rea&s;on, when it would have di&s;covered the illu&s;ion,
and &s;hewn him, what he never wi&s;hed to &s;ee, his
real &s;tate.</P>
<P>He is even accu&s;ed, after having lulled his ima|gination
with tho&s;e ideal opiates, of having tried
the &s;ame experiment upon his con&s;cience; and having
accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to impute all deviations from the
right to foreign cau&s;es, it is certain that he was upon
<PB N="lxiii" REF="68">
every occa&s;ion too ea&s;ily reconciled to him&s;elf, and
that he appeared very little to regret tho&s;e practices
which had impaired his reputation. The reigning
error of his life was, that he mi&s;took the love for the
practice of virtue, and was indeed not &s;o much a
good man, as the friend of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>This at lea&s;t mu&s;t be allowed him, that he always
pre&s;erved a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the dignity, the beauty,
and the nece&s;&s;ity of virtue, and that he never con|tributed
deliberately to &s;pread corruption among&s;t
mankind; his actions, which were generally pre|cipitate,
were often blameable; but his writings,
being the productions of &s;tudy, uniformly tended to
the exaltation of the mind, and the propagation of
morality and piety.</P>
<P>The&s;e writings may improve mankind, when his
failings &s;hall be forgotten, and therefore he mu&s;t be
con&s;idered upon the whole as a benefactor to the
world; nor can his per&s;onal example do any hurt,
&s;ince, whoever hears of his faults, will hear of the
mi&s;eries which they brought upon him, and which
would de&s;erve le&s;s pity, had not his condition been
&s;uch as made his faults pardonable. He may be
con&s;idered as a child expo&s;ed to all the temptations
of indigence, at an age when re&s;olution was not yet
&s;trengthened by conviction, nor virtue confirmed by
habit; a circum&s;tance, which in his BASTARD he
laments in a very affecting manner.</P>
<LG>

<L>No Father's guardian hand my youth maintain'd,</L>
<L>Call'd forth my virtues, or from vice re&s;train'd.</L>
</LG>
<P>THE BASTARD, however it might provoke or
mortify his mother, could not be expected to melt
her to compa&s;&s;ion, &s;o that he was &s;till under the &s;ame
<PB N="lxiv" REF="69">
want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and he therefore ex|erted
all the intere&s;t which his wit, or his birth, or his
misfortunes could procure, to obtain upon the death
of Eu&s;den the place of Poet Laureat, and pro&s;e|cuted
his application with &s;o much diligence, that
the King publickly declared it his intention to be|&s;tow
it upon him; but &s;uch was the fate of Savage,
that even the King, when he intended his advantage,
was di&s;appointed in his &s;chemes; for the Lord Cham|berlain,
who has the di&s;po&s;al of the laurel, as one
of the appendages of his office, either did not know
the King's de&s;ign, or did not approve it, or thought
the nomination of the Laureat an encroachment up|on
his rights, and therefore be&s;towed the laurel upon
Colly Cibber.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage, thus di&s;appointed, took a re&s;olution
of applying to the Queen, that having once given
him life, &s;he would enable him to &s;upport it, and
therefore publi&s;hed a &s;hort poem on her birth-day,
to which he gave the odd title of VOLUNTEER
LAUREAT.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol II p. 220.</NOTE> The event of this e&s;&s;ay he has him&s;elf
related in the following letter, which he prefixed to
the poem, when he afterwards reprinted it in THE
GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE, from whence I have
copied it intire, as this was one of the few attempts
in which Mr. Savage &s;ucceeded.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>&startq;Mr. URBAN,&endq;</OPENER>
<P>&startq;In your Magazine for February you publi&s;hed
the la&s;t VOLUNTEER LAUREAT, written on a very
melancholy occa&s;ion, the death of the royal pa|trone&s;s
of arts and literature in general, and of the
author of that poem in particular: I now &s;end you
the fir&s;t that Mr. Savage wrote under that title.&mdash;
This gentleman, notwith&s;tanding a very con&s;ider|able
<PB N="lxv" REF="70">
intere&s;t, being, on the death of Mr. Eu&s;den,
di&s;appointed of the Laureat's place, wrote the be|fore-mentioned
poem<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 220.</NOTE>; which were no &s;ooner pub|li&s;hed,
but the late Queen &s;ent to a book&s;eller for them:
the author had not at that time a friend either to
get him introduced, or his poem pre&s;ented at court;
yet &s;uch was the un&s;peakable goodne&s;s of that
Prince&s;s, that, notwith&s;tanding this act of cere|mony
was wanting, in a few days after publication,
Mr. Savage received a Bank-bill of fifty pounds,
and a gracious me&s;&s;age from her Maje&s;ty, by the
Lord North and Guildford, to this effect:&endq; &startq;That
her Maje&s;ty was highly plea&s;ed with the ver&s;es;
that &s;he took particularly kind his lines there re|lating
to the King; that he had permi&s;&s;ion to write
annually on the &s;ame &s;ubject; and that he &s;hould
yearly receive the like pre&s;ent, till &s;omething bet|ter
(which was her Maje&s;ty's intention) could be
done for him.&endq; &startq;After this he was permitted to
pre&s;ent one of his annual poems to her Maje&s;ty,
had the honour of ki&s;&s;ing her hand, and met with
the mo&s;t gracious reception.</P>
<CLOSER>Your's, &amp;c.&endq;</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Such was the performance, and &s;uch its reception;
a reception which, though by no means unkind, was
yet not in the highe&s;t degree generous: to chain
down the genius of a writer to an annual panegyric,
&s;hewed in the Queen too much de&s;ire of hearing her
own prai&s;es, and a greater regard to her&s;elf than to
him on whom her bounty was conferred. It was a
kind of avaricious genero&s;ity, by which flattery was
rather purcha&s;ed than genius rewarded.</P>
<P>Mrs. Oldfield had formerly given him the &s;ame
allowance with much more heroic intention; &s;he had
no other view than to enable him to pro&s;ecute his
&s;tudies, and to &s;et him&s;elf above the want of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
<PB N="lxvi" REF="71">
and was contented with doing good without
&s;tipulating for encomiums.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage however was not at liberty to make
exceptions, but was ravi&s;hed with the favours which
he had received, and probably yet more with tho&s;e
which he was promi&s;ed; he con&s;idered him&s;elf now
as a favourite of the Queen, and did not doubt but
a few annual poems would e&s;tabli&s;h him in &s;ome pro|fitable
employment.</P>
<P>He therefore a&s;&s;umed the title of VOLUNTEER
LAUREAT, not without &s;ome reprehen&s;ions from
Cibber, who informed him, that the title of LAU|REAT
was a mark of honour conferred by the King,
from whom all honour is derived, and which there|fore
no man has a right to be&s;tow upon him&s;elf; and
added, that he might with equal propriety &s;tile him|&s;elf
a Volunteer Lord, or Volunteer Baronet. It
cannot be denied that the remark was ju&s;t; but Sa|vage
did not think any title, which was conferred
upon Mr. Cibber, &s;o honourable as that the u&s;urpa|tion
of it could be imputed to him as an in&s;tance of
very exorbitant vanity, and therefore continued to
write under the &s;ame title, and received every year
the &s;ame reward.</P>
<P>He did not appear to con&s;ider the&s;e encomiums as
te&s;ts of his abilities, or as any thing more than an|nual
hints to the Queen of her promi&s;e, or acts of
ceremony, by the performance of which he was in|titled
to his pen&s;ion, and therefore did not labour
them with great diligence, or print more than fifty
each year, except that for &s;ome of the la&s;t years he
regularly in&s;erted them in THE GENTLEMAN'S
MAGAZINE, by which they were di&s;per&s;ed over the
kingdom.</P>
<P>Of &s;ome of them he had him&s;elf &s;o low an opi|nion,
that he intended to omit them in the collection
of poems, for which he printed propo&s;als, and &s;oli|cited
<PB N="lxvii" REF="72">
&s;ub&s;criptions; nor can it &s;eem &s;trange, that
being confined to the &s;ame &s;ubject, he &s;hould be at
&s;ome times indolent, and at others un&s;ucce&s;sful; that
he &s;hould &s;ometimes delay a di&s;agreeable ta&s;k, till it
was too late to perform it well; or that he &s;hould
&s;ometimes repeat the &s;ame &s;entiment on the &s;ame
occa&s;ion, or at others be mi&s;&s;ed by an attempt after
novelty to forced conceptions, and far-fetched image.</P>
<P>He wrote indeed with a double intention, which
&s;upplied him with &s;ome variety; for his bu&s;ine&s;s was
to prai&s;e the Queen for the favours which he had re|ceived,
and to complain to her of the delay of tho&s;e
which &s;he had promi&s;ed: in &s;ome of his pieces, there|fore,
gratitude is predominant, and in &s;ome di&s;con|tent;
in &s;ome he repre&s;ents him&s;elf as happy in her
patronage, and in others as di&s;con&s;olate to find him|&s;elf
neglected.</P>
<P>Her promi&s;e, like other promi&s;es made to this
unfortunate man, was never performed, though he
took &s;ufficient care that it &s;hould not be forgotten.
The publication of his VOLUNTEER LAUREAT pro|cured
him no other reward than a regular remittance
of fifty pounds.</P>
<P>He was not &s;o depre&s;&s;ed by his di&s;appointments as
to neglect any opportunity that was offered of ad|vancing
his intere&s;t. When the Prince&s;s Anne was
married, he wrote a poem<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">V$$. II. p. 1$$.</NOTE> upon her departure, only,
as he declared, &startq;becau&s;e it was expected from him,&endq;
and he was not willing to bar his own pro&s;pects by
any appearance of neglect.</P>
<P>He never mentioned any advantage gained by this
poem, or any regard that was paid to it, and there|fore
it is likely that it was con&s;idered at court as an
act of duty to which he was obliged by his depen|dence,
and which it was therefore not nece&s;&s;ary to
reward by any new favour: or perhaps the Queen
really intended his advancement, and therefore
<PB N="lxviii" REF="73">
thought it &s;uperfluous to lavi&s;h pre&s;ents upon a man
whom &s;he intended to e&s;tabli&s;h for life.</P>
<P>About this time not only his hopes were in danger
of being fru&s;trated, but his pen&s;ion likewi&s;e of be|ing
ob&s;tructed by an accidental calumny. The writer
of THE DAILY COURANT, a paper then publi&s;hed
under the direction of the mini&s;try, charged him
with a crime, which though not very great in it&s;elf,
would have been remarkably invidious in him, and
might very ju&s;tly have incen&s;ed the Queen again&s;t
him. He was accu&s;ed by name of influencing elec|tions
again&s;t the court, by appearing at the head of
a tory mob; nor did the accu&s;er fail to aggravate
his crime, by repre&s;enting it as the effect of the
mo&s;t atrocious ingratitude, and a kind of rebellion
again&s;t the Queen, who had fir&s;t pre&s;erved him from
an infamous death, and afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed
him by her favour, and &s;upported him by her cha|rity.
The charge, as it was open and confident,
was likewi&s;e by good fortune very particular. The
place of the tran&s;action was mentioned, and the
whole &s;eries of the rioter's conduct related. This
exactne&s;s made Mr. Savage's vindication ea&s;y; for
he never had in his life &s;een the place which was de|clared
to be the &s;cene of his wickedne&s;s, nor ever
had been pre&s;ent in any town when its repre&s;entatives
were cho&s;en. This an&s;wer he therefore made ha&s;te
to publi&s;h, with all the circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary to
make it credible, and very rea&s;onably demanded,
that the accu&s;ation &s;hould be retracted in the &s;ame
paper, that he might no longer &s;uffer the imputation
of &s;edition and ingratitude. This demand was like|wi&s;e
pre&s;&s;ed by him in a private letter to the author
of the paper, who either tru&s;ting to the protection
of tho&s;e who&s;e defence he had undertaken, or having
entertained &s;ome per&s;onal malice again&s;t Mr. Savage,
or fearing, le&s;t, by retracting &s;o confident an a&s;&s;er|tion,
<PB N="lxix" REF="74">
he &s;hould impair the credit of his paper, re|fu&s;ed
to give him that &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary, to his
own vindication, to pro&s;ecute him in the King's
Bench; but as he did not find any ill effects from
the accu&s;ation, having &s;ufficiently cleared his inno|cence,
he thought any farther procedure would have
the appearance of revenge, and therefore willingly
dropped it.</P>
<P>He &s;aw &s;oon afterwards a proce&s;s commenced in
the &s;ame court again&s;t him&s;elf, on an information in
which he was accu&s;ed of writing and publi&s;hing an
ob&s;cene pamphlet.</P>
<P>It was always Mr. Savage's de&s;ire to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed,
and when any controver&s;y became popular,
he never wanted &s;ome rea&s;on for engaging in it with
great ardour, and appearing at the head of the party
which he had cho&s;en. As he was never celebrated
for his prudence, he had no &s;ooner taken his &s;ide,
and informed him&s;elf of the chief topics of the di&s;|pute,
than he took all opportunities of a&s;&s;erting and
propagating his principles, without much regard to
his own intere&s;t, or any other vi&s;ible de&s;ign than that
of drawing upon him&s;elf the attention of mankind.</P>
<P>The di&s;pute between the Bi&s;hop of London and
the Chancellor is well known to have been for &s;ome
time the chief topic of political conver&s;ation, and
therefore Mr. Savage, in pur&s;uance of his character,
endeavoured to become con&s;picuous among the con|troverti&s;ts
with which every coffee-hou&s;e was filled
on that occa&s;ion. He was an indefatigable oppo&s;er
of all the claims of eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, though he
did not know on what they were founded, and was
therefore no friend to the Bi&s;hop of London. But
he had another rea&s;on for appearing as a warm ad|vocate
for Dr. Rundle, for he was the friend of Mr.
<PB N="lxx" REF="75">
Fo&s;ter and Mr. Thomp&s;on, who were the friends of
Mr. Savage.</P>
<P>Thus remote was his intere&s;t in the que&s;tion, which
however, as he imagined, concerned him &s;o nearly,
that it was not &s;ufficient to harangue and di&s;pute,
but nece&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e to write upon it.</P>
<P>He therefore engaged with great ardour in a new
Poem, called by him, THE PROGRESS OF A DIVINE<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. III.</NOTE>,
in which he conducts a profligate prie&s;t by all the
gradations of wickedne&s;s from a poor curacy in the
country, to the highe&s;t preferments of the church,
and de&s;cribes with that humour which was natural
to him, and that knowledge which was extended to
all the diver&s;ities of human life, his behaviour in every
&s;tation, and in&s;inuates, that this prie&s;t, thus accom|pli&s;hed,
found at la&s;t a patron in the Bi&s;hop of
London.</P>
<P>When he was a&s;ked by one of his friends, on what
pretence he could charge the Bi&s;hop with &s;uch an
action, he had no more to &s;ay, than that he had only
inverted the accu&s;ation, and that he thought it rea|&s;onable
to believe, that he, who ob&s;tructed the ri&s;e
of a good man without rea&s;on, would for bad rea&s;ons
promote the exaltation of a villain.</P>
<P>The clergy were univer&s;ally provoked by this
&s;atire, and Savage, who, as was his con&s;tant prac|tice,
had &s;et his name to his performance, was cen|&s;ured
in THE WEEKLY MISCELLANY<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>A &s;hort &s;atire was likewi&s;e publi&s;hed in the &s;ame paper, in which were the following lines:</P>

<P>GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE, May 1735.</P></NOTE> with &s;eve|rity,
which he did not &s;eem inclined to forget.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxi" REF="76">
But a return of invective was not thought a &s;uf|ficient
puni&s;hment. The Court of King's Bench
was therefore moved again&s;t him, and he was obliged
<PB N="lxxii" REF="77">
to return an an&s;wer to a charge of ob&s;cenity. It
was urged in his defence, that ob&s;cenity was criminal
when it was intended to promote the practice of vice,
but that Mr. Savage had only introduced ob&s;cene ideas,
with the view of expo&s;ing them to dete&s;tation, and
of amending the age, by &s;hewing the deformity of
wickedne&s;s. This plea was admitted, and Sir Philip
Yorke, who then pre&s;ided in that court, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
the information with encomiums upon the purity and
excellence of Mr. Savage's writings.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecution, however, an&s;wered in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e by whom it was &s;et on
foot; for Mr. Savage was &s;o far intimidated by it,
that when the edition of his poem was &s;old, he did
not venture to reprint it; &s;o that it was in a &s;hort
time forgotten, or forgotten by all but tho&s;e whom
it offended.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that &s;ome endeavours were u&s;ed to in|cen&s;e
the Queen again&s;t him, but he found advocates
to obviate at lea&s;t part of their effect; for though he
was never advanced, he &s;till continued to receive his
pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>This poem drew more in&s;amy upon him than any
incident of his life, and as his conduct cannot be
vindicated, it is proper to &s;ecure his memory from
reproach, by informing tho&s;e whom he made his
enemies, that he never intended to repeat the pro|vocation;
and that, though whenever he thought he
had any rea&s;on to complain of the clergy, he u&s;ed
to threaten them with a new edition of THE PRO|GRESS
OF A DIVINE, it was his calm and &s;ettled
re&s;olution to &s;uppre&s;s it for ever.</P>
<P>He once intended to have made a better reparation
for the folly or inju&s;tice with which he might be
charged, by writing another poem, called, THE
PROGRESS OF A FREETHINKER, whom he intended
to lead through all the &s;tages of vice and folly, to
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="78">
convert him from virtue to wickedne&s;s, and from
religion to infidelity, by all the modi&s;h &s;ophi&s;try u&s;ed
for that purpo&s;e; and at la&s;t to di&s;mi&s;s him by his
own hand into the other world.</P>
<P>That he did not execute this de&s;ign is a real lo&s;s
to mankind, for he was too well acquainted with all
the &s;cenes of debauchery to have failed in his re|pre&s;entations
of them, and too zealous for virtue not
to have repre&s;ented them in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould
expo&s;e them either to ridicule or dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>But this plan was like others, formed and laid
a&s;ide, till the vigour of his imagination was &s;pent,
and the efferve&s;cence of invention had &s;ub&s;ided, but
&s;oon gave way to &s;ome other de&s;ign, which plea&s;ed
by its novelty for a while, and then was neglected
like the former.</P>
<P>He was &s;till in his u&s;ual exigencies, having no
certain &s;upport but the pen&s;ion allowed him by the
Queen, which, though it might have kept an exact
o$conomi&s;t from want, was very far from being &s;uf|ficient
for Mr. Savage, who had never been accu&s;|tomed
to di&s;mi&s;s any of his appetites without the
gratification which they &s;olicited, and whom nothing
but want of money withheld from partaking of
every plea&s;ure that fell within his view.</P>
<P>His conduct with regard to his pen&s;ion was very
particular. No &s;ooner had he changed the bill, than
he vani&s;hed from the &s;ight of all his acquaintances,
and lay for &s;ome time out of the reach of all the
enquiries that friend&s;hip or curio&s;ity could make
after him; at length he appeared again pennyle&s;s as
before, but never informed even tho&s;e whom he
&s;eemed to regard mo&s;t, where he had been, nor was
his retreat ever di&s;covered.</P>
<P>This was his con&s;tant practice during the whole
time that he received the pen&s;ion from the Queen:
He regularly di&s;appeared and returned. He indeed
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="79">
affirmed, that he retired to &s;tudy, and that the money
&s;upported him in &s;olitude for many months; but his
friends declared, that the &s;hort time in which it was
&s;pent &s;ufficiently confuted his own account of his
conduct.</P>
<P>His politene&s;s and his wit &s;till rai&s;ed him friends,
who were de&s;irous of &s;etting him at length free from
that indigence by which he had been hitherto op|pre&s;&s;ed,
and therefore &s;olicited Sir Robert Walpole
in his favour with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, that they
obtained a promi&s;e of the next place that &s;hould
become vacant, not exceeding two hundred pounds
a year. This promi&s;e was made with an uncommon
declaration. &startq;that it was not the promi&s;e of a mi|ni&s;ter
to a petitioner, but of a friend to his friend.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Savage now concluded him&s;elf &s;et at ea&s;e for
ever, and as he ob&s;erve, in a poem<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 173.</NOTE> written on that
incident of his life, tru&s;ted and was tru&s;ted, but &s;oon
found that his confidence was ill-grounded, and this
friendly promi&s;e was not inviolable. He &s;pent a
long time in &s;olicitations, and at la&s;t de&s;paired and
de&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>He did not indeed deny that he had given the
mini&s;ter &s;ome rea&s;on to believe that he &s;hould not
&s;trengthen his own intere&s;t by advancing him, for he
had taken care to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in coffee-hou&s;es
as an advocate for the mini&s;try of the la&s;t years of
Queen Anne, and was always ready to ju&s;tify the
conduct, and exalt the character of Lord Boling|broke,
whom he mentions with great regard in an
epi&s;tle upon authors, which he wrote about that
time, but was too wi&s;e to publi&s;h, and of which
only &s;ome fragments<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 202.</NOTE> have appeared, in&s;erted by
him in the MAGAZINE after his retirement.</P>
<P>To de&s;pair was not, however, the character of
Savage; when one patronage failed, he had recour&s;e
<PB N="lxxv" REF="80">
to another. The prince was now extremely popular,
and had very liberally rewarded the merit of &s;ome
writers, whom Mr. Savage did not think &s;uperior to
him&s;elf, and therefore he re&s;olved to addre&s;s a poem
to him.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he made choice of a &s;ubject,
which could regard only per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank
and greate&s;t affluence, and which was therefore pro|per
for a poem intended to procure the patronage of
a prince; and having retired for &s;ome time to Rich|mond,
that he might pro&s;ecute his de&s;ign in full
tranquillity, without the temptations of plea&s;ure, or
the &s;olicitations of creditors, by which his medita|tions
were in equal danger of being di&s;concerted, he
produced a poem ON PUBLIC SPIRIT, WITH RE|GARD
TO PUBLIC WORKS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 131.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The plan of this poem is very exten&s;ive, and com|pri&s;es
a multitude of topics, each of which might
furni&s;h matter &s;ufficient for a long performance, and
of which &s;ome have already employed more eminent
writers; but as he was perhaps not fully acquainted
with the whole extent of his own de&s;ign, and was
writing to obtain a &s;upply of wants too pre&s;&s;ing to
admit of long or accurate enquiries, he pa&s;&s;es neg|ligently
over many public works, which, even in
his own opinion, de&s;erved to be more elaborately
treated.</P>
<P>But though he may &s;ometimes di&s;appoint his reader
by tran&s;ient touches upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, which have
often been con&s;idered, and therefore naturally rai&s;e
expectations, he mu&s;t be allowed amply to compen|&s;ate
his omi&s;&s;ions, by expatiating in the conclu&s;ion
of his work upon a kind of beneficence not yet
celebrated by any eminent poet, though it now
appears more &s;u&s;ceptible of embelli&s;hments, more
adapted to exalt the ideas, and affect the pa&s;&s;ions,
than many of tho&s;e which have hitherto been thought
<PB N="lxxvi" REF="81">
mo&s;t worthy of the ornaments of ver&s;e. The &s;ettle|ment
of colonies in uninhabited countries, the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of tho&s;e in &s;ecurity, who&s;e misfortunes
have made their own country no longer plea&s;ing or
&s;afe, the acqui&s;ition of property without injury to
any, the appropriation of the wa&s;te and luxuriant
bounties of nature, and the enjoyment of tho&s;e gifts
which heaven has &s;cattered upon regions uncultivated
and unoccupied, cannot be con&s;idered without giving
ri&s;e to a great number of plea&s;ing ideas, and be|wildering
the imagination in delightful pro&s;pects;
and, therefore, whatever &s;peculations they may pro|duce
in tho&s;e who have confined them&s;elves to po|litical
&s;tudies, naturally fixed the attention, and
excited the applau&s;e of a poet. The politician,
when he con&s;iders men driven into other countries
for &s;helter, and obliged to retire to fore&s;ts and de|&s;erts,
and pa&s;s their lives and fix their po&s;terity in
the remote&s;t corners of the world, to avoid tho&s;e
hard&s;hips which they &s;uffer or fear in their native
place, may very properly enquire why the legi&s;lature
does not provide a remedy for the&s;e mi&s;eries, rather
than encourage an e&s;cape from them. He may con|clude,
that the flight of every hone&s;t man is a lo&s;s
to the community, that tho&s;e who are unhappy
without guilt ought to be relieved, and the life,
which is overburthened by accidental calamities, &s;et
at ea&s;e by the care of the public; and that tho&s;e,
who have by mi&s;conduct forfeited their claim to
favour, ought rather to be made u&s;eful to the &s;ociety
which they have injured, than be driven from it.
But the poet is employed in a more plea&s;ing under|taking
than that of propo&s;ing laws, which, however
ju&s;t or expedient, will never be made, or endeavour|ing
to reduce to rational &s;chemes of government
&s;ocieties which were formed by chance, and are con|ducted
by the private pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who pre&s;ide in
<PB N="lxxvii" REF="82">
them. He guides the unhappy fugitive from want
and per&s;ecution, to plenty, quiet, and &s;ecurity, and
&s;eats him in &s;cenes of peaceful &s;olitude, and undi|&s;turbed
repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Savage has not forgotten, amid&s;t the plea&s;ing &s;en|timents
which this pro&s;pect of retirement &s;ugge&s;ted
to him, to cen&s;ure tho&s;e crimes which have been
generally committed by the di&s;coverers of new re|gions,
and to expo&s;e the enormous wickedne&s;s of
making war upon barbarous nations becau&s;e they
cannot re&s;i&s;t, and of invading countries becau&s;e they
are fruitful; of extending navigation only to pro|pagate
vice, and of vi&s;iting di&s;tant lands only to lay
them wa&s;te. He has a&s;&s;erted the natural equality of
mankind, and endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s that pride
which inclines men to imagine that right is the con|&s;equence
of power<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 141.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His de&s;cription of the various mi&s;eries which force
men to &s;eek for refuge in di&s;tant countries, affords
another in&s;tance of his proficiency in the important
and exten&s;ive &s;tudy of human life, and the tender|ne&s;s
with which he recounts them, another proof of
his humanity and benevolence.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the clo&s;e of this poem di&s;|covers
a change which experience had made in Mr.
Savage's opinions. In a poem written by him in his
youth, and publi&s;hed in his Mi&s;cellanies, he de|clares
his contempt of the contracted views and nar|row
pro&s;pects of the middle &s;tate of life, and de|clares
his re&s;olution either to tower like the cedar,
or be trampled like the &s;hrub; but in this poem,
though addre&s;&s;ed to a prince, he mentions this &s;tate
of life as compri&s;ing tho&s;e who ought mo&s;t to attract
reward, tho&s;e who merit mo&s;t the confidence of
power, and the familiarity of greatne&s;s, and acci|dentally
mentioning this pa&s;&s;age to one of his friends,
<PB N="lxxviii" REF="83">
declared, that in his opinion all the virtue of man|kind
was comprehended in that &s;tate.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing villas and gardens, he did not omit
to condemn that ab&s;urd cu&s;tom which prevails among
the Engli&s;h of permitting &s;ervants to receive money
from &s;trangers for the entertainment that they re|ceive,
and therefore in&s;erted in his poem the&s;e lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>But what the flow'ring pride of gardens rare,</L>
<L>However royal, or however fair,</L>
<L>If gates, which to acce&s;s &s;hould &s;till give way,</L>
<L>Ope but, like Peter's paradi&s;e, for pay?</L>
<L>If perqui&s;ited varlets frequent &s;tand,</L>
<L>And each new walk mu&s;t a new tax demand?</L>
<L>What foreign eye but with contempt &s;urveys?</L>
<L>What mu&s;e &s;hall from oblivion &s;natch their prai&s;e?</L>
</LG>
<P>But before the publication of his performance he
recollected, that the Queen allowed her garden and
cave at Richmond to be &s;hewn for money, and that
&s;he &s;o openly countenanced the practice, that &s;he
had be&s;towed the privilege of &s;hewing them as a
place of profit on a man, who&s;e merit &s;he valued
her&s;elf upon rewarding, though &s;he gave him only
the liberty of di&s;gracing his country.</P>
<P>He therefore thought, with more prudence than
was often exerted by him, that the publication of
the&s;e lines might be officiou&s;ly repre&s;ented as an
in&s;ult upon the Queen, to whom he owed his life
and his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and that the propriety of his
ob&s;ervation would be no &s;ecurity again&s;t the cen&s;ures
which the un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of it might draw upon
him; he therefore &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age in the fir&s;t
edition, but after the Queen's death thought the
&s;ame caution no longer nece&s;&s;ary, and re&s;tored it to
the proper place.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxix" REF="84">
The poem was therefore publi&s;hed without any
political faults, and in&s;cribed to the Prince; but
Mr. Savage, having no friend upon whom he could
prevail to pre&s;ent it to him, had no other method of
attracting his ob&s;ervation than the publication of
frequent adverti&s;ements, and therefore received no
reward from his patron, however generous on other
occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>This di&s;appointment he never mentioned without
indignation, being by &s;ome means or other confident
that the Prince was not ignorant of his addre&s;s to
him, and in&s;inuated, that if any advances in popu|larity
could have been made by di&s;tingui&s;hing him,
he had not written without notice, or without reward.</P>
<P>He was once inclined to have pre&s;ented his poem
in per&s;on, and &s;ent to the printer for a copy with
that de&s;ign; but either his opinion changed, or his
re&s;olution de&s;erted him, and he continued to re&s;ent
neglect without attempting to force him&s;elf into
regard.</P>
<P>Nor was the public much more favourable than
his patron, for only &s;eventy-two were &s;old, though
the performance was much commended by &s;ome
who&s;e judgment in that kind of writing is generally
allowed. But Savage ea&s;ily reconciled him&s;elf to
mankind without imputing any defect to his work,
by ob&s;erving that his poem was unluckily publi&s;hed
two days after the prorogation of the parliament,
and by con&s;equence at a time when all tho&s;e who
could be expected to regard it were in the hurry of
preparing for their departure, or engaged in taking
leave of others upon their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from public
affairs.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be however allowed, in ju&s;tification of the
public, that this performance is not the mo&s;t excel|lent
of Mr. Savage's works, and that though it can|not
be denied to contain many &s;triking &s;entiments,
<PB N="lxxx" REF="85">
maje&s;tic lines, and ju&s;t ob&s;ervations, it is in general
not &s;ufficiently poli&s;hed in the language, or enlivened
in the imagery, or dige&s;ted in the plan.</P>
<P>Thus his poem contributed nothing to the allevia|tion
of his poverty, which was &s;uch as very few
could have &s;upported with equal patience, but to
which it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be confe&s;&s;ed, that few would
have been expo&s;ed who received punctually fifty
pounds a year; a &s;alary which though by no means
equal to the demands of vanity and luxury, is yet
found &s;ufficient to &s;upport families above want, and
was undoubtedly more than the nece&s;&s;ities of life
require.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner had he received his pen&s;ion, than
he withdrew to his darling privacy, from which he
returned in a &s;hort time to his former di&s;tre&s;s, and
for &s;ome part of the year generally lived by chance,
eating only when he was invited to the tables of his
acquaintances, from which the meanne&s;s of his dre&s;s
often excluded him, when the politene&s;s and variety
of his conver&s;ation would have been thought a &s;uffi|cient
recompence for his entertainment.</P>
<P>He lodged as much by accident as he dined, and
pa&s;&s;ed the night, &s;$metimes in mean hou&s;es, which
are &s;et open at night to any ca&s;ual wanderers, &s;ome|times
in cellars among the riot and filth of the meane&s;t
and mo&s;t profligate of the rabble; and &s;ometimes,
when he had not money to &s;upport even the expences
of the&s;e receptacles, walked about the &s;treets till he
was weary, and lay down in the &s;ummer upon a
bulk, or in the winter with his a&s;&s;ociates in poverty,
among the a&s;hes of a gla&s;s-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In this manner were pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e days and tho&s;e
nights which nature had enabled him to have em|ployed
in elevated &s;peculations, u&s;eful &s;tudies, or
plea&s;ing conver&s;ation. On a bulk, in a cellar, or
in a gla&s;s-hou&s;e among thieves and beggars, was to
<PB N="lxxxi" REF="86">
be found the Author of THE WANDERER, the man
of exalted &s;entiments, exten&s;ive views, and curious
ob&s;ervations; the man who&s;e remarks on life might
have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;tate&s;man, who&s;e ideas of virtue
might have enlightened the morali&s;t, who&s;e eloquence
might have influenced &s;enates, and who&s;e delicacy
might have poli&s;hed courts.</P>
<P>It cannot be imagined that &s;uch nece&s;&s;ities might
&s;ometimes force him upon di&s;reputable practices;
and it is probable that the&s;e lines in THE WAN|DERER
were occa&s;ioned by his reflections on his own
conduct:</P>
<LG>
<L>Tho' mis'ry leads to happine&s;s, and truth,</L>
<L>Unequal to the load, this languid youth,</L>
<L>(O, let none cen&s;ure, if, untried by grief,</L>
<L>If, amid&s;t woe, untempted by relief,)</L>
<L>He &s;toop'd reluctant to low arts of &s;hame,</L>
<L>Which then, e'en then he &s;corn'd, and blu&s;h'd to name.</L>
</LG>
<P>Whoever was acquainted with him was certain to
be &s;olicited for &s;mall &s;ums, which the frequency of
the reque&s;t made in time con&s;iderable, and he was
therefore quickly &s;hunned by tho&s;e who were become
familiar enough to be tru&s;ted with his nece&s;&s;ities;
but his rambling manner of life, and con&s;tant ap|pearance
at hou&s;es of public re&s;ort, always procured
him a new &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of friends, who&s;e kindne&s;s had
not been exhau&s;ted by repeated reque&s;ts, &s;o that he
was &s;eldom ab&s;olutely without re&s;ources, but had in
his utmo&s;t exigences this comfort, that he always
imagined him&s;elf &s;ure of &s;peedy relief.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved that he always a&s;ked favours of
this kind without the lea&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or apparent
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of dependence, and that he did not
&s;eem to look upon a compliance with his reque&s;t as
an obligation that de&s;erved any extraordinary ac|knowledgments,
<PB N="lxxxii" REF="87">
but a refu&s;al was re&s;ented by him
as an affront, or complained of as an injury; nor
did he readily reconcile him&s;elf to tho&s;e who either
denied to lend, or gave him afterwards any intima|tion,
that they expected to be repaid.</P>
<P>He was &s;ometimes &s;o far compa&s;&s;ionated by tho&s;e
who knew both his merit and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that they
received him into their families, but they &s;oon di&s;|covered
him to be a very incommodious inmate; for
being always accu&s;tomed to an irregular manner of
life, he could not confine him&s;elf to any &s;tated
hours, or pay any regard to the rules of a family,
but would prolong his conver&s;ation till midnight,
without con&s;idering that bu&s;ine&s;s might require his
friend's application in the morning; and when he
had per&s;uaded him&s;elf to retire to bed, was not,
without equal difficulty, called up to dinner; it was
therefore impo&s;&s;ible to pay him any di&s;tinction with|out
the entire &s;ubver&s;ion of all economy, a kind of
e&s;tabli&s;hment which, wherever he went, he always
appeared ambitious to overthrow.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t therefore be acknowledged, in ju&s;tification
of mankind, that it was not always by the negli|gence
or coldne&s;s of his friends that Savage was
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but becau&s;e it was in reality very difficult
to pre&s;erve him long in a &s;tate of ea&s;e. To &s;upply
him with money was a hopele&s;s attempt, for no
&s;ooner did he &s;ee him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a &s;um &s;ufficient
to &s;et him free from care for a day, than he became
profu&s;e and luxurious. When once he had entered
a tavern, or engaged in a &s;cheme of plea&s;ure, he
never retired till want of money obliged him to &s;ome
new expedient. If he was entertained in a family,
nothing was any longer to be regarded there but
amu&s;ements and jollity; wherever Savage entered he
immediately expected that order and bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould
$ly before him, that all &s;hould thenceforward be left
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="88">
to hazard, and that no dull principle of dome&s;tic
management &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to his inclination, or
intrude upon his gaiety.</P>
<P>His di&s;tre&s;&s;es, however afflictive, never dejected
him; in his lowe&s;t &s;tate he wanted not &s;pirit to a&s;&s;ert
the natural dignity of wit, and was always ready to
repre&s;s that in&s;olence which &s;uperiority of fortune
incited, and to trample that reputation which ro&s;e
upon any other ba&s;is than that of merit: he never
admitted any gro&s;s familiarities, or &s;ubmitted to be
treated otherwi&s;e than as an equal. Once, when he
was without lodging, meat, or cloaths, one of his
friends, a man not indeed remarkable for modera|tion
in his pro&s;perity, left a me&s;&s;age, that he de|&s;ired
to &s;ee him about nine in the morning. Savage
knew that his intention was to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but was
very much di&s;gu&s;ted that he &s;hould&punc; pre&s;ume to pre|&s;cribe
the hour of his attendance, and, I believe,
refu&s;ed to vi&s;it him, and rejected his kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ame invincible temper, whether firmne&s;s or
ob&s;tinacy, appeared in his conduct $ the Lord Tyr|connel,
from whom he very frequently demanded
that the allowance which was once paid him &s;hould
be re&s;tored, but with whom he never appeared to
entertain for a moment the thought of &s;oliciting a
reconciliation, and whom he treated at once with all
the haughtine&s;s of &s;uperiority, and all the bitterne&s;s
of re&s;entment. He wrote to him not in a &s;tyle of
&s;upplication or re&s;pect, but of reproach, menace and
contempt; and appeared determined, if he ever re|gained
his allowance, to hold it only by the right of
conque&s;t.</P>
<P>As many more can di&s;cover, that a man is richer
than that he is wi&s;er than them&s;elves, &s;uperiority of
under&s;tanding is not &s;o readily acknowledged as that
of fortune; nor is that haughtine&s;s, which the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of great abilities incites, borne with the
<PB N="lxxxiv" REF="89">
&s;ame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as the tyranny of affluence; and
therefore Savage, by a&s;&s;erting his claim to deference
and regard, and by treating tho&s;e with contempt
whom better fortune animated to rebel again&s;t him,
did not fail to rai&s;e a great number of enemies in
the different cla&s;&s;es of mankind. Tho&s;e who thought
them&s;elves rai&s;ed above him by the advantages of
riches, hated him becau&s;e they found no protection
from the petulance of his wit. Tho&s;e who were
e&s;teemed for their writings feared him as a critic,
and maligned him as a rival, and almo&s;t all the
&s;maller wits were his profe&s;&s;ed enemies.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e Mr. Millar &s;o far indulged his re|&s;entment
as to introduce him in a farce, and direct
him to be per&s;onated on the &s;tage in a dre&s;s like that
which he then wore; a mean in&s;ult, which only in&s;i|nuated
that Savage had but one coat, and which
was therefore de&s;pi&s;ed by him rather than re&s;ented;
for though he wrote a lampoon again&s;t Millar, he
never printed it: and as no other per&s;on ought to
pro&s;ecute that revenge from which the per&s;on who
was injured de&s;i&s;ted, I &s;hall not pre&s;erve what Mr.
Savage &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; of which the publication would
indeed have been a puni&s;hment too &s;evere for &s;o im|potent
an a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>The great hard&s;hips of poverty were to Savage not
the want of lodging or of food, but the neglect and
contempt which it drew upon him. He complained
that as his affairs grew de&s;perate, he found his repu|tation
for capacity vi&s;ibly decline; that his opinion
in que&s;tions of critici&s;m was no longer regarded,
when his coat was out of fa&s;hion; and that tho&s;e who
in the interval of his pro&s;perity were always encou|raging
him to great undertakings by encomiums on
his genius and a&s;&s;urances of &s;ucce&s;s, now received
any mention of his de&s;igns with coldne&s;s, thought
that the &s;ubjects on which he propo&s;ed to write were
<PB N="lxxxv" REF="90">
very difficult; and were ready to inform him, that
the event of a poem was uncertain, that an author
ought to employ much time in the con&s;ideration of
his plan, and not pre&s;ume to &s;it down to write in
confidence of a few cur&s;ory ideas, and a &s;uperficial
knowledge; difficulties were &s;tarted on all &s;ides, and
he was no longer qualified for any performance but
THE VOLUNTEER LAUREAT.</P>
<P>Yet even this kind of contempt never depre&s;&s;ed
him; for he always pre&s;erved a &s;teady confidence in
his own capacity, and believed nothing above his
reach which he &s;hould at any time earne&s;tly endea|vour
to attain. He formed &s;chemes of the &s;ame
kind with regard to knowledge and to fortune, and
flattered him&s;elf with advances to be made in &s;cience,
as with riches to be enjoyed in &s;ome di&s;tant period of
his life. For the acqui&s;ition of knowledge he was
indeed far better qualified than for that of riches;
for he was naturally inqui&s;itive and de&s;irous of the
conver&s;ation of tho&s;e from whom any information
was to be obtained, but by no means &s;olicitous to
improve tho&s;e opportunities that were &s;ometimes of|fered
of rai&s;ing his fortune; and he was remarkably
retentive of his ideas, which, when once he was in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, rarely for&s;ook him; a quality
which could never be communicated to his money.</P>
<P>While he was thus wearing out his life in expecta|tion
that the Queen would &s;ome time recollect her
promi&s;e, he had recour&s;e to the u&s;ual practice of
writers, and publi&s;hed propo&s;als for printing his
works by &s;ub&s;cription, to which he was encouraged
by the &s;ucce&s;s of many who had not a better right
to the favour of the public; but whatever was the
rea&s;on he did not find the world equally inclined to
favour him, and he ob&s;erved with &s;ome di&s;content,
that though he offered his works at half a guinea,
he was able to procure but a &s;mall number in com|pari&s;on
<PB N="lxxxvi" REF="91">
with tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;cribed twice as much to
Duck.</P>
<P>Nor was it without indignation that he &s;aw his
propo&s;als neglected by the Queen, who patroni&s;ed
Mr. Duck's with uncommon ardour, and incited a
competition among tho&s;e who attended the court,
who &s;hould mo&s;t promote his intere&s;t, and who &s;hould
fir&s;t offer a &s;ub&s;cription. This was a di&s;tinction to
which Mr. Savage made no &s;cruple of a&s;&s;erting that
his birth, his misfortunes, and his genius gave him
a fairer title than could be pleaded by him on whom
it was conferred.</P>
<P>Savage's applications were however not univer&s;ally
un&s;ucce&s;sful; for &s;ome of the nobility countenanced
his de&s;ign, encouraged his propo&s;als, and &s;ub&s;cribed
with great liberality. He related of the Duke of
Chandos particularly, that, upon receiving his pro|po&s;als,
he &s;ent him ten guineas.</P>
<P>But the money which his &s;ub&s;criptions afforded
him was not le&s;s volatile than that which he received
from his other &s;chemes; whenever a &s;ub&s;cription was
paid him he went to a tavern, and as money &s;o col|lected
is nece&s;&s;arily received in &s;mall &s;ums, he never
was able to &s;end his poems to the pre&s;s, but for many
years continued his &s;olicitation, and &s;quandered
whatever he obtained.</P>
<P>This project of printing his works was frequently
revived, and as his propo&s;als grew ob&s;olete, new
ones were printed with fre&s;her dates. To form
&s;chemes for the publication was one of his favourite
amu&s;ements, nor was he ever more at ea&s;e than when
with any friend who readily fell in with his &s;chemes,
he was adju&s;ting the print, forming the adverti&s;e|ments,
and regulating the di&s;per&s;ion of his new edi|tion,
which he really intended &s;ome time to publi&s;h,
and which, as long as experience had &s;hewn him the
impo&s;&s;ibility of printing the volume together, he at
<PB N="lxxxvii" REF="92">
la&s;t determined to divide into weekly or monthly
numbers, that the profits of the fir&s;t might &s;upply
the expences of the next.</P>
<P>Thus he &s;pent his time in mean expedients and
tormenting &s;u&s;pen&s;e, living for the greate&s;t part in
fear of pro&s;ecutions from his creditors, and con&s;e|quently
&s;kulking in ob&s;cure parts of the town, of
which he was no &s;tranger to the remote&s;t corners.
But wherever he came his addre&s;s &s;ecured him friends,
whom his nece&s;&s;ities &s;oon alienated, &s;o that he had
perhaps a more numerous acquaintance than any
man ever before attained, there being &s;carcely any
per&s;on eminent on any account to whom he was not
known, or who&s;e character he was not in &s;ome de|gree
able to delineate.</P>
<P>To the acqui&s;ition of this exten&s;ive acquaintance
every circum&s;tance of his life contributed. He ex|celled
in the arts of conver&s;ation, and therefore
willingly practi&s;ed them: He had &s;eldom any home,
or even a lodging in which he could be private, and
therefore was driven into public-hou&s;es for the com|mon
conveniences of life, and &s;upports of nature.
He was always ready to comply with every invitation,
having no employment to withhold him, and often
no money to provide for him&s;elf; and by dining
with one company, he never failed of obtaining an
introduction into another.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;&s;ipated was his life, and thus ca&s;ual his
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence; yet did not the di&s;traction of his views
hinder him from reflection, nor the uncertainty of
his condition depre&s;s his gaiety. When he had
wandered about without any fortunate adventure by
which he was led into a tavern, he &s;ometimes retired
into the fields, and was able to employ his mind in
&s;tudy, or amu&s;e it with plea&s;ing imaginations; and
&s;eldom appeared to be melancholy, but when &s;ome
&s;udden misfortune had ju&s;t fallen upon him, and
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="93">
even then in a few moments he would di&s;entangle
him&s;elf from his perplexity, adopt the &s;ubject of
conver&s;ation, and apply his mind wholly to the
objects that others pre&s;ented to it.</P>
<P>This life, unhappy as it may be already imagined,
was yet imbittered in 1738, with new calamities.
The death of the Queen deprived him of all the
pro&s;pects of preferment with which he &s;o long enter|tained
his imagination; and as Sir Robert Walpole
had before given him rea&s;on to believe that he never
intended the performance of his promi&s;e, he was
now abandoned again to fortune.</P>
<P>He was however, at that time, &s;upported by a
friend; and as it was not his cu&s;tom to look out for
di&s;tant calamities, or to feel any other pain than
that which forced it&s;elf upon his &s;en&s;es, he was not
much afflicted at his lo&s;s, and perhaps comforted
him&s;elf that his pen&s;ion would be now continued
without the annual tribute of a panegyric.</P>
<P>Another expectation contributed likewi&s;e to &s;up|port
him: he had taken a re&s;olution to write a &s;econd
tragedy upon the &s;tory of Sir Thomas Overbury, in
which he pre&s;erved a few lines of his former play;
but made a total alteration of the plan, added new
incidents, and introduced new characters; &s;o that it
was a new tragedy, not a revival of the former.</P>
<P>Many of his friends blamed him for not making
choice of another &s;ubject; but in vindication of him|&s;elf,
he a&s;&s;erted, that it was not ea&s;y to find a better;
and that he thought it his intere&s;t to extingui&s;h the
memory of the fir&s;t tragedy, which he could only do
by writing one le&s;s defective upon the &s;ame &s;tory;
by which he &s;hould entirely defeat the artifice of the
book&s;ellers, who after the death of any author of
reputation, are always indu&s;trious to &s;well his works,
by uniting his wor&s;t productions with his be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxix" REF="94">
In the execution of this &s;cheme however, he pro|ceeded
but &s;lowly, and probably only employed him|&s;elf
upon it when he could find no other amu&s;ement;
but he plea&s;ed him&s;elf with counting the profits, and
perhaps imagined, that the theatrical reputation
which he was about to acquire, would be equivalent
to all that he had lo&s;t by the death of his patrone&s;s.</P>
<P>He did not, in confidence of his approaching
riches, neglect the mea&s;ures proper to &s;ecure the
continuance of his pen&s;ion, though &s;ome of his fa|vourers
thought him culpable for omitting to write
on her death; but on her birth-day next year, he
gave a proof of the &s;olidity of his judgment, and
the power of his genius. He knew that the track
of elegy had been &s;o long beaten, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible
to travel in it without treading in the foot|&s;teps
of tho&s;e who had gone before him; and that
therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary, that he might di&s;tingui&s;h
him&s;elf from the herd of encomia&s;ts, to find out
&s;ome new walk of funeral panegyric.</P>
<P>This difficult ta&s;k he performed in &s;uch a manner,
that his poem may be ju&s;tly ranked among the be&s;t
pieces that the death of princes has produced. By
transferring the mention of her death to her birth|day,
he has formed a happy combination of topics,
which any other man would have thought it very
difficult to connect in one view; but which he has
united in &s;uch a manner, that the relation between
them appears natural; and it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid,
that what no other man would have thought on, it
now appears &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for any man to mi&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 227.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The beauty of this peculiar combination of images
is &s;o ma&s;terly, that it is &s;ufficient to &s;et this poem
above cen&s;ure; and therefore it is not nece&s;&s;ary to
mention many other delicate touches which may be
<PB N="xc" REF="95">
found in it, and which would de&s;ervedly be admired
in any other performance.</P>
<P>To the&s;e proofs of his genius may be added, from
the &s;ame poem, an in&s;tance of his prudence, an ex|cellence
for which he was not &s;o often di&s;tingui&s;hed;
he does not forget<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 129.</NOTE> to remind the King in the mo&s;t
delicate and artful manner of continuing his pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;ucce&s;s of this addre&s;s, he was
for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; but was in no great de|gree
&s;olicitous about it; and continued his labour
upon his new tragedy with great tranquillity, till the
friend, who had for a con&s;iderable time &s;upported
him, removing his family to another place, took
occa&s;ion to di&s;mi&s;s him. It then became nece&s;&s;ary
to enquire more diligently what was determined in
his affair, having rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that no great
favour was intended him, becau&s;e he had not re|ceived
his pen&s;ion at the u&s;ual time.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that he did not take tho&s;e methods of
retrieving his intere&s;t, which were mo&s;t likely to
&s;ucceed; and &s;ome of tho&s;e who were employed in
the Exchequer, cautioned him again&s;t too much
violence in his proceedings; but Mr. Savage, who
&s;eldom regulated his conduct by the advice of others,
gave way to his pa&s;&s;ion, and demanded of Sir Robert
Walpole, at his levee, the rea&s;on of the di&s;tinction
that was made between him and the other pen&s;ioners
of the Queen, with a degree of roughne&s;s, which
perhaps determined him to withdraw what had been
only delayed.</P>
<P>Whatever was the crime of which he was accu&s;ed
or &s;u&s;pected, and whatever influence was employed
again&s;t him, he received &s;oon after an account that
took from him all hopes of regaining his pen&s;ion;
and he had now no pro&s;pect of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but from
his play, and he knew no way of living for the time
required to fini&s;h it.</P>
<P><PB N="xci" REF="96">
So peculiar were the misfortunes of this man,
deprived of an e&s;tate and title by a particular law,
expo&s;ed and abandoned by a mother, defrauded by
a mother of a fortune which his father had allotted
him, he entered the world without a friend; and
though his abilities forced them&s;elves into e&s;teem and
reputation, he was never able to obtain any real
advantage, and whatever pro&s;pects aro&s;e, were always
intercepted as he began to approach them. The
King's intentions in his favour were fru&s;trated; his
Dedication<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 229.</NOTE> to the Prince, who&s;e genero&s;ity on every
other occa&s;ion was eminent, procured him no re|ward;
Sir Robert Walpole, who valued him&s;elf
upon keeping his promi&s;e to others, broke it to him
without regret; and the bounty of the Queen was,
after her death, withdrawn from him, and from him
only.</P>
<P>Such were his misfortunes, which yet he bore not
only with decency, but with cheerfulne&s;s, nor was
his gaiety clouded even by his la&s;t di&s;appointments,
though he was in a &s;hort time reduced to the lowe&s;t
degree of di&s;tre&s;s; and often wanted both lodging
and food. At this time he gave another in&s;tance of
the in&s;urmountable ob&s;tinacy of his &s;pirit: his cloaths
were worn out, and he received notice, that at a
coffee-hou&s;e &s;ome cloaths and linen were left for
him; the per&s;on who &s;ent them, did not, I believe,
inform him to whom he was to be obliged, that he
might &s;pare the perplexity of acknowledging the
benefit; but though the offer was &s;o far generous,
it was made with &s;ome neglect of ceremonies, which
Mr. Savage &s;o much re&s;ented, that he refu&s;ed the
pre&s;ent, and declined to enter the hou&s;e, till the
cloaths that had been de&s;igned for him were taken
away.</P>
<P>His di&s;tre&s;s was now publickly known, and his
friends, therefore, thought it proper to concert &s;ome
<PB N="xcii" REF="97">
mea&s;ures for his relief; and one of them wrote a
letter to him, in which he expre&s;&s;ed his concern &startq;for
the mi&s;erable withdrawing of his pen&s;ion;&endq; and
gave him hopes, that in a &s;hort time he &s;hould find
him&s;elf &s;upplied with a competence, &startq;without any
dependance on tho&s;e little creatures which we are
plea&s;ed to call the Great.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;cheme propo&s;ed for this happy and inde|pendent
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, was, that he &s;hould retire into
Wales, and receive an allowance of fifty pounds a
year, to be rai&s;ed by a &s;ub&s;cription, on which he
was to live privately in a cheap place, without a&s;|piring
any more to affluence, or having any farther
care of reputation.</P>
<P>This offer Mr. Savage gladly accepted, though
with intentions very different from tho&s;e of his
friends; for they propo&s;ed that he &s;hould continue
an exile from London for ever, and &s;pend all the
remaining part of his life at Swan&s;ea; but he de|&s;igned
only to take the opportunity, which their
&s;cheme offered him, of retreating for a &s;hort time,
that he might prepare his play for the &s;tage, and his
other works for the pre&s;s, and then to return to
London to exhibit his tragedy, and live upon the
profits of his own labour.</P>
<P>With regard to his works, he propo&s;ed very great
improvements, which would have required much
time, or great application; and when he had fini&s;hed
them, he de&s;igned to do ju&s;tice to his &s;ub&s;cribers,
by publi&s;hing them according to his propo&s;als.</P>
<P>As he was ready to entertain him&s;elf with future
plea&s;ures, he had planned out a &s;cheme of life for
the country, of which he had no knowledge but
from pa&s;torals and &s;ongs. He imagined that he
&s;hould be tran&s;ported to &s;cenes of flowery felicity,
like tho&s;e which one poet has reflected to another,
<PB N="xciii" REF="98">
and had projected a perpetual round of innocent
plea&s;ures, of which he &s;u&s;pected no interruption
from pride, or ignorance, or brutality.</P>
<P>With the&s;e expectations he was &s;o enchanted, that
when he was once gently reproached by a friend for
&s;ubmitting to live upon a &s;ub&s;cription, and advi&s;ed
rather by a re&s;olute exertion of his abilities to &s;up|port
him&s;elf, he could not bear to debar him&s;elf
from the happine&s;s which was to be found in the
calm of a cottage, or lo&s;e the opportunity of li&s;ten|ing,
without intermi&s;&s;ion, to the melody of the
nightingale, which he believed was to be heard from
every bramble, and which he did not fail to mention
as a very important part of the happine&s;s of a country
life.</P>
<P>While this &s;cheme was ripening, his friends di|rected
him to take a lodging in the liberties of the
Fleet, that he might be &s;ecure from his creditors,
and &s;ent him every Monday a guinea, which he
commonly &s;pent before the next morning, and tru&s;ted,
after his u&s;ual manner, the remaining part of the
week to the bounty of fortune.</P>
<P>He now began very &s;en&s;ibly to feel the mi&s;eries of
dependance: Tho&s;e by whom he was to be &s;up|ported,
began to pre&s;cribe to him with an air of
authority, which he knew not how decently to re&s;ent,
nor patiently to bear; and he &s;oon di&s;covered from
the conduct of mo&s;t of his &s;ub&s;cribers, that he was
yet in the hands of &startq;Little creatures.&endq;</P>
<P>Of the in&s;olence that he was obliged to &s;uffer, he
gave many in&s;tances, of which none appeared to
rai&s;e his indignation to a greater height, than the
method which was taken of furni&s;hing him with
cloaths. In&s;tead of con&s;ulting him, and allowing
him to &s;end a tailor his orders for what they thought
proper to allow him, they propo&s;ed to &s;end for a
<PB N="xciv" REF="99">
tailor to take his mea&s;ure, and then to con&s;ult how
they &s;hould equip him.</P>
<P>This treatment was not very delicate, nor was it
&s;uch as Savage's humanity would have &s;ugge&s;ted to
him on a like occa&s;ion; but it had &s;carcely de&s;erved
mention, had it not, by affecting him in an uncom|mon
degree, &s;hewn the peculiarity of his character.
Upon hearing the de&s;ign that was formed, he came
to the lodging of a friend with the mo&s;t violent
agonies of rage; and being a&s;ked what it could be
that gave him &s;uch di&s;turbance, he replied with the
utmo&s;t vehemence of indignation, &startq;That they had
&s;ent for a tailor to mea&s;ure him.&endq;</P>
<P>How the affair ended was never enquired, for fear
of renewing his unea&s;ine&s;s. It is probable, that,
upon recollection, he &s;ubmitted with a good grace
to what he could not avoid, and that he di&s;covered
no re&s;entment where he had no power.</P>
<P>He was, however, not humbled to implicit and
univer&s;al compliance; for when the gentleman, who
had fir&s;t informed him of the de&s;ign to &s;upport him
by a &s;ub&s;cription, attempted to procure a recon|ciliation
with the Lord Tyrconnel, he could by no
means be prevailed upon to comply with the mea|&s;ures
that were propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>A letter was written for him<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">By Mr. Pope,</NOTE> to Sir William Le|mon,
to prevail upon him to interpo&s;e his good
offices with Lord Tyrconnel, in which he &s;olicited
Sir William's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &startq;for a man who really
needed it as much as any man could well do;&endq;
and informed him, that he was retiring &startq;for ever to
a place where he &s;hould no more trouble his rela|tions,
friends, or enemies;&endq; he confe&s;&s;ed, that his
pa&s;&s;ion had betrayed him to &s;ome conduct with regard
to Lord Tyrconnel, &startq;for which he could not but
<PB N="xcv" REF="100">
heartily a&s;k his pardon;&endq; and as he imagined Lord
Tyrconnel's pa&s;&s;ion might be yet &s;o high, that he
would not &startq;receive a letter from him,&endq; begged that
Sir William would endeavour to &s;often him; and
expre&s;&s;ed his hopes that he would comply with his
reque&s;t, and that &startq;&s;o &s;mall a relation would not
harden his heart again&s;t him.&endq;</P>
<P>That any man &s;hould pre&s;ume to dictate a letter
to him, was not very agreeable to Mr. Savage; and
therefore he was, before he had opened it, not much
inclined to approve it. But when he read it, he
found it contained &s;entiments entirely oppo&s;ite to his
own; and, as he a&s;&s;erted, to the truth; and there|fore
in&s;tead of copying it, wrote his friend a letter
full of ma&s;culine re&s;entment and warm expo&s;tula|tions.
He very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that the &s;tyle was
too &s;upplicatory, and the repre&s;entation too abject,
and that he ought at lea&s;t to have made him com|plain
with &startq;the dignity of a gentleman in di&s;tre&s;s.&endq;
He declared that he would not write the paragraph
in which he was to a&s;k Lord Tyrconnel's pardon;
for &startq;he de&s;pi&s;ed his pardon, and therefore could not
heartily, and would not hypocritically, a&s;k it.&endq; He
remarked, that his friend made a very unrea&s;onable
di&s;tinction between him&s;elf and him; for, &s;ays he,
when you mention men of high rank &startq;in your own
character,&endq; they are &startq;tho&s;e little creatures whom
we are plea&s;ed to call the great;&endq; but when you
addre&s;s them &startq;in mine,&endq; no &s;ervility is &s;ufficiently
humble. He then with great propriety explained
the ill con&s;equences which might be expected from
&s;uch a letter, which his relations would print in their
own defence, and which would for ever be produced
as a full an&s;wer to all that he &s;hould allege again&s;t
them; for he always intended to publi&s;h a minute
account of the treatment which he had received. It
is to be remembered, to the honour of the gentle|man
<PB N="xcvi" REF="101">
by whom this letter was drawn up, that he
yielded to Mr. Savage's rea&s;ons, and agreed that it
ought to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>After many alterations and delays, a &s;ub&s;cription
was at length rai&s;ed which did not amount to fifty
pounds a year, though twenty were paid by one gen|tleman;
&s;uch was the genero&s;ity of mankind, that
what had been done by a player without &s;olicitation,
could not now be effected by application and intere&s;t;
and Savage had a great number to court and to obey
for a pen&s;ion le&s;s than that which Mrs. Oldfield paid
him without exacting any &s;ervilities.</P>
<P>Mr. Savage however was &s;atisfied, and willing to
retire, and was convinced that the allowance, though
&s;canty, would be more than &s;ufficient for him, being
now determined to commence a rigid economi&s;t, and
to live according to the exacte&s;t rules of frugality;
for nothing was in his opinion more contemptible
than a man, who, when he knew his income, exceeded
it; and yet he confe&s;&s;ed, that in&s;tances of &s;uch folly
were too common, and lamented that &s;ome men were
not to be tru&s;ted with their own money.</P>
<P>Full of the&s;e &s;alutary re&s;olutions, he left London
in July 1739, having taken leave with great tender|ne&s;s
of his friends, and parted from the author of
this narrative with tears in his eyes. He was fur|ni&s;hed
with fifteen guineas, and informed, that they
would be &s;ufficient, not only for the expence of his
journey, but for his &s;upport in Wales for &s;ome time;
and that there remained but little more of the fir&s;t
collection. He promi&s;ed a &s;trict adherence to his
maxims of par&s;imony, and went away in the &s;tage|coach;
nor did his friends expect to hear from him,
till he informed them of his arrival at Swan&s;ea.</P>
<P>But when they lea&s;t expected, arrived a letter
dated the fourteenth day after his departure, in
which he &s;ent them word, that he was yet upon the
<PB N="xcvii" REF="102">
road, and without money; and that he therefore
could not proceed without a remittance. They then
&s;ent him the money that was in their hands, with
which he was enabled to reach Bri&s;tol, from whence
he was to go to Swan&s;ea by water.</P>
<P>At Bri&s;tol he found an embargo laid upon the
&s;hipping, &s;o that he could not immediately obtain a
pa&s;iage; and being therefore obliged to &s;tay there
&s;ome time, he, with his u&s;ual felicity, ingratiated
him&s;elf with many of the principal inhabitants, was
invited to their hou&s;es, di&s;tingui&s;hed at their public
&s;ea&s;ts, and treated with a regard that gratified his
vanity, and therefore ea&s;ily engaged his affection.</P>
<P>He began very early after his retirement to com|plain
of the conduct of his friends in London, and
irritated many of them &s;o much by his letters, that
they withdrew, however honourably, their contri|butions;
and it is believed, that little more was
paid him than the twenty pounds a year, which were
allowed him by the gentleman who propo&s;ed the
&s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;tay at Bri&s;tol he retired to Swan&s;ea,
the place originally propo&s;ed for his re&s;idence, where
he lived about a year very much di&s;&s;atisfied with the
diminution of his &s;alary; but contracted, as in other
places, acquaintance with tho&s;e who were mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed
in that country, among whom he has
celebrated Mr. Powel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 217.</NOTE> and Mrs. Jones<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 197.</NOTE>, by &s;ome
ver&s;es which he in&s;erted in THE GENTLEMAN'S
MAGAZINE.</P>
<P>Here he completed his tragedy, of which two acts
were wanting when he left London, and was de|&s;irous
of coming to town to bring it upon the &s;tage.
This de&s;ign was very warmly oppo&s;ed, and he was
advi&s;ed by his chief benefactor to put it into the
hands of Mr. Thom&s;on and Mr. Mallet, that it
<PB N="xcviii" REF="103">
might be fitted for the &s;tage, and to allow his friends
to receive the profits, out of which an annual pen|&s;ion
&s;hould be paid him.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al he rejected with the utmo&s;t con|tempt.
He was by no means convinced that the
judgment of tho&s;e to whom he was required to &s;ub|mit,
was &s;uperior to his own. He was now deter|mined,
as he expre&s;&s;ed it, to be &startq;no longer kept in
leading-&s;trings,&endq; and had no elevated idea of &startq;his
bounty,&endq; who propo&s;ed to &startq;pen&s;ion him out of the
profits his own labours.&endq;</P>
<P>He attempted in Wales to promote a &s;ub&s;cription
for his works, and had once hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; but
in a &s;hort time afterwards formed a re&s;olution of
leaving that part of the country, to which he thought
it not rea&s;onable to be confined for the gratification
of tho&s;e, who, having promi&s;ed him a liberal income,
had no &s;ooner bani&s;hed him to a remote corner, than
they reduced his allowance to a &s;alary &s;carcely equal
to the nece&s;&s;ities of life.</P>
<P>His re&s;entment of this treatment, which, in his
own opinion at lea&s;t, he had not de&s;erved, was &s;uch,
that he broke off all corre&s;pondence with mo&s;t of his
contributors, and appeared to con&s;ider them as per|&s;ecutors
and oppre&s;&s;ors; and in the latter part of his
life declared, that their conduct toward him, &s;ince
his departure from London, &startq;had been per&s;idious|ne&s;s
improving on per$idiou&s;ne&s;s, and inhumanity
on inhumanity.&endq;</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the nece&s;&s;ities of Mr.
Savage did not &s;ometimes incite him to &s;atirical ex|aggerations
of the behaviour of tho&s;e by whom he
thought him&s;elf reduced to them. But it mu&s;t be
granted, that the diminution of his allowance was a
great hard&s;hip, and that tho&s;e who withdrew their
&s;ub&s;cription from a man, who, upon the faith of
their promi&s;e, had gone into a kind of bani&s;hment,
<PB N="xcix" REF="104">
and abandoned all tho&s;e by whom he had been be|fore
relieved in his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, will find it no ea&s;y ta&s;k
to vindicate their conduct.</P>
<P>It may be alleged, and perhaps ju&s;tly, that he was
petulant and contemptuous, that he more frequently
reproached his &s;ub&s;cribers for not giving him more,
than thanked them for what he received; but it is
to be remembered, that this conduct, and this is the
wor&s;t charge that can be drawn up again&s;t him, did
them no real injury; and that it therefore ought ra|ther
to have been pitied than re&s;ented, at lea&s;t the
re&s;entment it might provoke ought to have been ge|nerous
and manly; epithets which his conduct will
hardly de&s;erve that &s;tarves the man whom he has
per&s;uaded to put him&s;elf into his power.</P>
<P>It might have been rea&s;onably demanded by Sa|vage,
that they &s;hould, before they had taken away
what they promi&s;ed, have replaced him in his former
&s;tate, that they &s;hould have taken no advantages
from the &s;ituation to which the appearance of their
kindne&s;s had reduced him, and that he &s;hould have
been recalled to London before he was abandoned.
He might ju&s;tly repre&s;ent, that he ought to have
been con&s;idered as a lion in the toils, and demand
to be relea&s;ed before the dogs &s;hould be loo&s;ed upon
him.</P>
<P>He endeavoured, indeed, to relea&s;e him&s;elf, and
with an intent to return to London, went to Bri&s;tol,
where a repetition of the kindne&s;s which he had for|merly
found, invited him to &s;tay. He was not only
care&s;&s;ed and created, but had a collection made for
him of about thirty pounds, with which it had been
happy if he had immediately departed for London;
but his negligence did not &s;uffer him to con&s;ider,
that &s;uch proofs of kindne&s;s were not often to be ex|pected,
and that this ardour of benevolence was in a
great degree the effect of novelty, and might, pro|bably,
<PB N="c" REF="105">
be every day le&s;s; and therefore he took no
care to improve the happy time, but was encouraged
by one favour to hope for another, till at length ge|nero&s;ity
was exhau&s;ted, and officiou&s;ne&s;s wearied.</P>
<P>Another part of his mi&s;conduct was the practice of
prolonging his vi&s;its to un&s;ea&s;onable hours, and di&s;|concerting
all the families into which he was admit|ted.
This was an error in a place of commerce
which all the charms of his conver&s;ation could not
compen&s;ate; for what trader would purcha&s;e &s;uch
airy &s;atisfaction by the lo&s;s of &s;olid gain, which mu&s;t
be the con&s;equence of midnight merriment, as tho&s;e
hours which were gained at night were generally lo&s;t
in the morning?</P>
<P>Thus Mr. Savage, after the curio&s;ity of the inha|bitants
was gratified, found the number of his friends
daily decrea&s;ing, perhaps without &s;u&s;pecting for what
rea&s;on their conduct was altered; for he &s;till conti|nued
to harra&s;s, with his nocturnal intru&s;ions, tho&s;e
that yet countenanced him, and admitted him to
their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>But he did not &s;pend all the time of his re&s;idence
at Bri&s;tol in vi&s;its or at taverns, for he &s;ometimes re|turned
to his &s;tudies, and began &s;everal con&s;iderable
de&s;igns. When he felt an inclination to write, he
always retired from the knowledge of his friends,
and lay hid in an ob&s;eure part of the &s;uburbs, till he
&s;ound him&s;elf again de&s;irous of company, to which
it is likely that intervals of ab&s;ence made him more
welcome.</P>
<P>He was always full of his de&s;ign of returning to
London to bring his tragedy upon the &s;tage; but
having neglected to depart with the money that was
rai&s;ed for him, he could not afterwards procure a
&s;um &s;ufficient to defray the expences of his journey;
nor perhaps would a fre&s;h &s;upply have had any other
effect, than, by putting immediate plea&s;ures in his
<PB N="ci" REF="106">
power, to have driven the thoughts of his journey
out of his mind.</P>
<P>While he was thus &s;pending the day in contriving
a &s;cheme for the morrow, di&s;tre&s;s &s;tole upon him by
imperceptible degrees. His conduct had already
wearied &s;ome of tho&s;e who were at fir&s;t enamoured
of his conver&s;ation; but he might, perhaps, &s;till
have devolved to others, whom he might have enter|tained
with equal &s;ucce&s;s, had not the decay of his
cloaths made it no longer con&s;i&s;tent with their vanity
to admit him to their tables, or to a&s;&s;ociate with him
in public places. He now began to find every man from
home at who&s;e hou&s;e he called; and was therefore no
longer able to procure the nece&s;&s;aries of life, but
wandered about the town &s;lighted and neglected in
que&s;t of a dinner which he did not always obtain.</P>
<P>To complete his mi&s;ery he was pur&s;ued by the
officers for &s;mall debt; which he had contracted; and
was therefore obliged to withdraw from the &s;mall
number of friends from whom he had &s;till rea&s;on to
hope for favours. His cu&s;tom was to lie in bed the
greate&s;t part of the day, and to go out in the dark
with the utmo&s;t privacy, and after having paid his
vi&s;it return again before morning to his lodging,
which was in the garret of an ob&s;cure inn.</P>
<P>Being thus excluded on one hand, and confined
on the other, he &s;uffered the utmo&s;t extremities of
poverty, and often fa&s;ted &s;o long that he was &s;eized
with faintne&s;s, and had lo&s;t his appetite, not being
able to bear the &s;mell of meat, till the action of his
&s;tomach was re&s;tored by a cordial.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s he received a remittance of five
pounds from London, with which he provided him|&s;elf
a decent coat, and determined to go to London,
but unhappily &s;pent his money at a favourite tavern.
Thus was he again confined to Bri&s;tol, where he was
every day hunted by bailiffs. In this exigence he
<PB N="cii" REF="107">
once more found a friend, who &s;heltered him in his
hou&s;e, though at the u&s;ual inconveniences with which
his company was attended; for he could neither be
per&s;uaded to go to bed in the night, nor to ri&s;e in
the day.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that in the&s;e various &s;cenes of
mi&s;ery, he was always di&s;engaged and cheerful: he
at &s;ome times pur&s;ued his &s;tudies, and at others con|tinued
or enlarged his epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence, nor
was he ever &s;o far dejected as to endeavour to procure
an increa&s;e of his allowance by any other methods
than accu&s;ations and reproaches.</P>
<P>He had now no longer any hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from
his friends at Bri&s;tol, who as merchants, and by con|&s;equence
&s;ufficiently &s;tudious of profit, cannot be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have looked with much compa&s;&s;ion upon
negligence and extravagance, or to think any excel|lence
equivalent to a fault of &s;uch con&s;equence as
neglect of economy. It is natural to imagine, that
many of tho&s;e who would have relieved his real
wants, were di&s;couraged from the exertion of their
benevolence by ob&s;ervation of the u&s;e which was
made of their favours, and conviction that relief
would only be momentary, and that the &s;ame nece&s;|&s;ity
would quickly return.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he quitted the hou&s;e of his friend, and
returned to his lodging at the inn, &s;till intending to
&s;et out in a few days for London; but on the 10th
of January 1742-3, having been at &s;upper with two
of his friends, he was at his return to his lodgings
arre&s;ted for a debt of about eight pounds, which he
owed at a coffee-hou&s;e, and conducted to the hou&s;e
of a &s;heriff's officer. The account which he gives
of this misfortune, in a letter to one of the gentlemen
with whom he had &s;upped, is too remarkable to be
omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="ciii" REF="108">
&startq;It was not a little unfortunate for me, that I
&s;pent ye&s;terday's evening with you; becau&s;e the
hour hindered me from entering on my new lodg|ing;
however, I have now got one, but &s;uch an
one, as I believe nobody would chu&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;I was arre&s;ted at the &s;uit of Mrs. Read, ju&s;t as I
was going up &s;tairs to bed, at Mr. Bowyer's; but
taken in &s;o private a manner, that I believe nobody
at the White Lion is appri&s;ed of it. Though I let
the officers know the &s;trength (or rather weakne&s;s)
of my pocket, yet they treated me with the utmo&s;t
civility, and even when they conducted me to con|finement,
it was in &s;uch a manner, that I verily
believe I could have e&s;caped, which I would rather
be ruined than have done, notwith&s;tanding the
whole amount of my finances was but three pence
halfpenny.</P>
<P>&startq;In the fir&s;t place I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t, that you will in|du&s;triou&s;ly
conceal this from Mrs. S&mdash;s, becau&s;e
I would not have her goodnature &s;uffer that pain,
which, I know, &s;he would be apt to feel on this
occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;Next, I conjure you, dear Sir, by all the ties of
friend&s;hip, by no means to have one unea&s;y thought
on my account; but to have the &s;ame plea&s;antry
of countenance and unruffled &s;erenity of mind,
which (God be prai&s;ed!) I have in this, and have
had in a much &s;everer calamity. Furthermore, I
charge you, if you value my friend&s;hip as truly as
I do yours, not to utter or even harbour the lea&s;t
re&s;entment again&s;t Mrs. Read. I believe &s;he has
ruined me, but I freely forgive her; and (though
I will never more have any intimacy with her)
would, at a due di&s;tance, rather do her an act of
good, than ill will. La&s;tly (pardon the expre&s;&s;ion),
I ab&s;olutely command you not to o&s;&s;er me any pe|cuniary
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor to attempt getting me any
from any one of your friends. At another time,
<PB N="civ" REF="109">
or on any other occa&s;ion, you may, dear friend, be
well a&s;&s;ured, I would rather write to you in the
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;tyle of a reque&s;t, than that of a peremp|tory
command.</P>
<P>&startq;However, that my truly valuable friend may not
think I am too proud to a&s;k a favour, let me en|treat
you to let me have your boy to attend me for
this day, not only for the &s;ake of &s;aving me the
expence of porters, but for the delivery of &s;ome
letters to people who&s;e names I would not have
known to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>&startq;The civil treatment I have thus far met from
tho&s;e, who&s;e pri&s;oner I am, makes me thankful to
the Almighty, that, though he has thought fit to
vi&s;it me (on my birth-night) with affliction, yet
(&s;uch is his great goodne&s;s!) my affliction is not
without alleviating circum&s;tances. I murmur not,
but am all re&s;ignation to the divine will. As to
the world, I hope that I &s;hall be endued by heaven
with that pre&s;ence of mind, that &s;erene dignity
in misfortune, that con&s;titutes the character of a
true nobleman; a dignity far beyond that of coro|nets;
a nobility ari&s;ing from the ju&s;t principles of
philo&s;ophy, refined and exalted by tho&s;e of chri&s;ti|anity.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>He continued five days at the officer's, in hopes
that he &s;hould be able to procure bail, and avoid the
nece&s;&s;ity of going to pri&s;on. The &s;tate in which he
pa&s;&s;ed his time, and the treatment which he received,
are very ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;ed by him in a letter which he
wrote to a friend: &startq;The whole day,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;has
been employed in various peoples&endq; filling my head
with their fooli&s;h chimerical &s;y&s;tems, which has
obliged me coolly (as far as nature will admit) to
dige&s;t, and accommodate my&s;elf to, every different
per&s;on's way of thinking; hurried from one wild
&s;y&s;tem to another, till it has quite made a chaos of
my imagination, and nothing done&mdash;promi&s;ed&mdash;
<PB N="cv" REF="110">
di&s;appointed&mdash;ordered to &s;end every hour, from
one part of the town to the other.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>When his friends, who had hitherto care&s;&s;ed and
applauded, found that to give bail and pay the debt
was the &s;ame, they all refu&s;ed to pre&s;erve him from
a pri&s;on, at the expence of eight pounds; and there|fore
after having been for &s;ome time at the officer's
hou&s;e, &startq;at an immen&s;e expence,&endq; as he ob&s;erves in his
letter, he was at length removed to Newgate.</P>
<P>This expence he was enabled to &s;upport by the
genero&s;ity of Mr. Na&s;h at Bath, who, upon receiving
from him an account of his condition, immediately
&s;ent him five guineas, and promi&s;ed to promote his
&s;ub&s;cription at Bath with all his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>By his removal to Newgate, he obtained at lea&s;t
a freedom from &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and re&s;t from the di&s;turb|ing
vici&s;&s;itudes of hope and di&s;appointment; he now
found that his friends were only companions, who
were willing to &s;hare his gaiety, but not to partake
of his misfortunes; and therefore he no longer ex|pected
any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t however be ob&s;erved of one gentleman,
that he offered to relea&s;e him by paying the debt,
but that Mr. Savage would not con&s;ent, I &s;uppo&s;e,
becau&s;e he thought he had been before too burthen|&s;ome
to him.</P>
<P>He was offered by &s;ome of his friends, that a col|lection
&s;hould be made for his enlargement, but he
treated the propo&s;al,&endq; and declared,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In a letter after his confinement.</NOTE> &startq;that he
&s;hould again treat it, with di&s;dain. As to writing
any mendicant letters, he had too high a &s;pirit,
and determined only to write to &s;ome mini&s;ters of
&s;tate, to try to regain his pen&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>He continued to complain<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter January 15.</NOTE> of tho&s;e that had &s;ent
him into the country, and objected to them, that he
had &startq;lo&s;t the profits of his play which had been
<PB N="cvi" REF="111">
fini&s;hed three years;&endq; and in another letter declare;
his re&s;olution to publi&s;h a pamphlet, that the world
might know how &startq;he had been u&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>This pamphlet was never written, for he in a very
&s;hort time recovered his u&s;ual tranquillity, and cheer|fully
applied him&s;elf to more inoffen&s;ive &s;tudies. He
indeed &s;teadily declared, that he was promi&s;ed a
yearly allowance of fifty pounds, and never received
half the &s;um; but he &s;eemed to re&s;ign him&s;elf to that
as well as to other misfortunes, and lo&s;e the remem|brance
of it in his amu&s;ements and employments.</P>
<P>The cheerfulne&s;s with which he bore his confine|ment,
appears from the following letter which he
wrote January the 30th to one of his friends in
London:</P>
<P>&startq;I now write to you from my confinement in New|gate,
where I have been ever &s;ince Monday la&s;t
was &s;e'en-night, and where I enjoy my&s;elf with
much more tranquillity than I have known for up|wards
of a twelvemonth pa&s;t; having a room en|tirely
to my&s;elf, and pu$&s;uing the amu&s;ement of
my poetical &s;tudies, uninterrupted and agreeable to
my mind. I thank the Almighty, I am now all
collected in my&s;elf, and though my per&s;on is in
confinement, my mind can expatiate on ample and
u&s;eful &s;ubjects with all the freedom imaginable. I
am now more conver&s;ant with the Nine than ever;
and if, in&s;tead of a Newgate-bird, I may be al|lowed
to be a bird of the Mu&s;es, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir,
I &s;ing very freely in my cage; &s;ometimes indeed
in the plaintive notes of the nightingale; but, at
others, in the cheerful &s;trains of the lark.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>In another letter he ob&s;erves, that he ranges from
one &s;ubject to another, without confining him&s;elf to
any particular ta&s;k, and that he was employed one
week upon one attempt, and the next upon another.</P>
<P>Surely the fortitude of this man de&s;erves, at lea&s;t,
to be mentioned with applau&s;e; and whatever faults
<PB N="cvii" REF="112">
may be imputed to him, the virtue of &s;uffering well
cannot be denied him. The two powers which, in
the opinion of Epictetus, con&s;tituted a wi&s;e man,
are tho&s;e of bearing and forbearing, which cannot
indeed be affirmed to have been equally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
Savage; and indeed the want of one obliged him
very frequently to practi&s;e the other.</P>
<P>He was treated by Mr. Dag$, the keeper of the
pri&s;on, with great humanity; was &s;upported by him
at his own table without any certainty of recom|pen&s;e,
had a room to him&s;elf, to which he could at
any time retire from all di&s;turbance, was allowed to
&s;tand at the door of the pri&s;on, and &s;ometimes taken
out into the fields; &s;o that he &s;uffered &s;ewer hard|&s;hips
in pri&s;on, than he had been accu&s;tomed to
undergo in the greate&s;t part of his life.</P>
<P>The keeper did not confine his benevolence to a
gentle execution of his office, but made &s;ome over|tures
to the creditor for his relea&s;e, but without
effect; and continued, during the whole time of
his impri&s;onment, to treat him with the utmo&s;t ten|derne&s;s
and civility.</P>
<P>Virtue is undoubtedly mo&s;t laudable in that &s;tate
which makes it mo&s;t difficult; and therefore the
humanity of a gaoler certainly de&s;erves this public
atte&s;tation; and the man, who&s;e heart has not been
hardened by &s;uch an employment, may be ju&s;tly
propo&s;ed as a pattern of benevolence. If an in|&s;cription
was once engraved to the &startq;hone&s;t toll|gatherer,&endq;
le&s;s honours ought not to be paid &startq;to
the tender gaoler.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Savage very frequently received vi&s;its, and
&s;ometimes pre&s;ents from his acquaintances, but they
did not amount to a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for the greater part
of which he was indebted to the genero&s;ity of this
keeper; but the&s;e favours, however they might
$ndear to him the particular per&s;ons from whom he
received them, were very far from impre&s;&s;ing upon
<PB N="cviii" REF="113">
his mind any advantageous ideas of the people of
Bri&s;tol, and therefore he thought he could not more
properly employ him&s;elf in pri&s;on, than in writing
a poem called &startq;London and Bri&s;tol<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 231.</NOTE> delineated.&endq;</P>
<P>When he had brought this poem to its pre&s;ent
&s;tate, which, without con&s;idering the cha&s;m, is not
perfect, he wrote to London an account of his de|&s;ign,
and informed his friend, that he was deter|mined
to print it with his name; but enjoined him
not to communicate his intention to his Bri&s;tol ac|quaintance.
The gentleman, &s;urpri&s;ed at his re&s;o|lution,
endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from publi&s;hing
it, at lea&s;t from prefixing his name, and declared,
that he could not reconcile the injunction of &s;ecrecy
with his re&s;olution to own it at its fir&s;t appearance.
To this Mr. Savage returned an an&s;wer agreeable to
his character in the following terms.</P>
<P>&startq;I received yours this morning, and not without
a little &s;urprize at the contents. To an&s;wer a
que&s;tion with a que&s;tion, you a&s;k me concerning
London and Bri&s;tol, Why will I add delineated?
Why did Mr. Woola&s;ton add the &s;ame word to his
RELIGION OF NATURE? I &s;uppo&s;e that it was
his will and plea&s;ure to add it in his ca&s;e; and it
is mine to do &s;o in my own. You are plea&s;ed to
tell me, that you under&s;tand not why &s;ecrecy is
enjoined, and yet I intend to &s;et my name to it.
My an&s;wer is&mdash;I have my private rea&s;ons, which
I am not obliged to explain to any one. You
doubt my friend Mr. S&mdash;would not approve
of it&mdash;And what is it to me whether he does or
not? Do you imagine that Mr. S&mdash;is to dictate
to me? If any man, who calls him&s;elf my friend,
&s;hould a&s;&s;ume &s;uch an air, I would &s;purn at his
friend&s;hip with contempt. You &s;ay I &s;eem to
think &s;o by not letting him know it&mdash;And &s;uppo&s;e
I do, what then? Perhaps I can give rea&s;ons for
<PB N="cix" REF="114">
that di&s;approbation, very foreign from what you
would imagine. You go on in &s;aying, Suppo&s;e I
&s;hould not put my name to it&mdash;My an&s;wer is, that
I will not &s;uppo&s;e any &s;uch thing, being deter|mined
to the contrary; neither, Sir, would I have
you &s;uppo&s;e, that I applied to you for want of
another pre&s;s: Nor would I have you imagine,
that I owe Mr. S&mdash;obligations which I do
not.&endq;</P>
<P>Such was his imprudence, and &s;uch his ob&s;tinate
adherence to his own re&s;olutions, however ab&s;urd.
A pri&s;oner! &s;upported by charity! and, whatever
in&s;ults he might have received during the latter part
of his &s;tay in Bri&s;tol, once care&s;&s;ed, e&s;teemed, and
pre&s;ented with a liberal collection, he could forget
on a &s;udden his danger and his obligations, to gra|tify
the petulance of his wit, or the eagerne&s;s of his
re&s;entment, and publi&s;hed a &s;atire, by which he
might rea&s;onably expect, that he &s;hould alienate
tho&s;e who then &s;upported him, and provoke tho&s;e
whom he could neither re&s;i&s;t nor e&s;cape.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution, from the execution of which, it
is probable, that only his death could have hindered
him, is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, how much he di&s;regarded
all con&s;iderations that oppo&s;ed his pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ions,
and how readily he hazarded all future advantages
for any immediate gratifications. Whatever was his
predominant inclination, neither hope nor fear hin|dered
him from complying with it, nor had oppo|&s;ition
any other effect than to heighten his ardour,
and irritate his vehemence.</P>
<P>This performance was however laid a&s;ide, while
he was employed in &s;oliciting a&s;&s;i&s;tance from &s;everal
great per&s;ons, and one interruption &s;ucceeding ano|ther,
hindered him from &s;upplying the cha&s;m, and
perhaps from retouching the other parts, which he
can hardly be imagined to have fini&s;hed, in his own
opinion; for it is very unequal, and &s;ome of the
<PB N="cx" REF="115">
lines are rather in&s;erted to rhyme to others, than to
&s;upport or improve the &s;en&s;e; but the fir&s;t and la&s;t
parts are worked up with great &s;pirit and elegance.</P>
<P>His time was &s;pent in the pri&s;on for the mo&s;t part
in &s;tudy, or in receiving vi&s;its; but &s;ometimes he
de&s;cended to lower amu&s;ements, and diverted him|&s;elf
in the kitchen with the conver&s;ation of the cri|minals;
for it was not plea&s;ing to him to be much
without company, and though he was very capable
of a judicious choice, he was often contented with
the fir&s;t that offered: for this he was &s;ometimes re|proved
by his friends, who found him &s;urrounded
with felons; but the reproof was on that, as on
other occa&s;ions, thrown away; he continued to gra|tify
him&s;elf, and to &s;et very little value on the opi|nion
of others.</P>
<P>But here, as in every other &s;cene of his life, he
made u&s;e of &s;uch opportunities as occurred of be|nefiting
tho&s;e who were more mi&s;erable than him&s;elf;
and was always ready to perform any offices of hu|manity
to his fellow-pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>He had now cea&s;ed from corre&s;ponding with any
of his &s;ub&s;cribers except one, who yet continued to
remit him the twenty pounds a year which he had
promi&s;ed him, and by whom it was expected, that
he would have been in a very &s;hort time enlarged,
becau&s;e he had directed the keeper to enquire after
the &s;tate of his debts.</P>
<P>However, he took care to enter his name accord|ing
to the forms of the court, that the creditor might
be obliged to make him &s;ome allowance, if he was
continued a pri&s;oner, and when on that occa&s;ion he
appeared in the hall was treated with very unu&s;ual
re&s;pect.</P>
<P>But the re&s;entment of the city was afterwards rai&s;ed
by &s;ome accounts that had been &s;pread of the &s;atire,
and he was informed that &s;ome of the merchants
intended to pay the allowance which the law re|quired,
<PB N="cxi" REF="116">
and to detain him a pri&s;oner at their own
expence. This he treated as an empty menace, and
perhaps might have ha&s;tened the publication, only
to &s;hew how much he was &s;uperior to their in&s;ults,
had not all his &s;chemes been &s;uddenly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>When he had been &s;ix months in pri&s;on, he re|ceived
from one of his friends<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pope.</NOTE>, in who&s;e kindne&s;s
he had the greate&s;t confidence, and on who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;|tance
he chiefly depended, a letter, that contained
a charge of very atrocious ingratitude, drawn up in
&s;uch terms as &s;udden re&s;entment dictated. Mr. Sa|vage
returned a very &s;olemn prote&s;tation of his in|nocence,
but however appeared much di&s;turbed at
the accu&s;ation. Some days afterwards he was &s;eized
with a pain in his back and &s;ide, which, as it was
not violent, was not &s;u&s;pected to be dangerous; but
growing daily more languid and dejected, on the
25th of July he confined him&s;elf to his room, and
a &s;ever &s;eized his &s;pirits. The &s;ymptoms grew every
day more formidable, but his condition did not
enable him to procure any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The la&s;t time
that the keeper &s;aw him was on July the 31&s;t<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">$word$</NOTE>, when
Savage, &s;eeing him at his bed-&s;ide, &s;aid, with an
uncommon earne&s;tne&s;s, &startq;I have &s;omething to &s;ay to
you, Sir;&endq; but, after a pau&s;e, moved his hand in
a melancholy manner, and finding him&s;elf unable
to recollect what he was going to communicate, &s;aid,
&startq;'Tis gone!&endq; The keeper &s;oon after left him, and
the next morning he died. He was buried in the
church-yard of St. Peter, at the expence of the
keeper.</P>
<P>Such were the life and death of Richard Savage,
a man equally di&s;tingui&s;hed by his virtues and vices,
and at once remarkable for his weakne&s;&s;es and abi|lities.</P>
<P>He was of a middle &s;tature, of a thin habit of
body, a long vi&s;age, coar&s;e features, and melancholy
<PB N="cxii" REF="117">
a&s;pect; of a grave and manly deportment, a &s;olemn
dignity of mien; but which, upon a nearer ac|quaintance,
&s;oftened into an engaging ea&s;ine&s;s of
manners. His walk was &s;low, and his voice tre|mulous
and mournful. He was ea&s;ily excited to
&s;miles, but very &s;eldom provoked to laughter.</P>
<P>His mind was in an uncommon degree vigorous
and active. His judgment was accurate, his appre|hen&s;ion
quick, and his memory &s;o tenacious, that
he was frequently ob&s;erved to know what he had
learned from others in a &s;hort time, better than tho&s;e
by whom he was informed, and could frequently
recollect incidents, with all their combination of
circum&s;tances, which few would have regarded at
the pre&s;ent time, but which the quickne&s;s of his
apprehen&s;ion impre&s;&s;ed upon him. He had the pe|culiar
felicity, that his attention never de&s;erted him:
he was pre&s;ent to every object, and regardful of the
mo&s;t tri&s;ling occurrences. He had the art of e&s;caping
from his own reflections, and accommodating him&s;elf
to every new &s;cene.</P>
<P>To this quality is to be imputed the extent of his
knowledge, compared with the &s;mall time which he
&s;pent in vi&s;ible endeavours to acquire it. He mingled
in cur&s;ory conver&s;ation with the &s;ame &s;teadine&s;s of
attention as others apply to a lecture, and, amid&s;t
the appearance of thoughtle&s;s gaiety, lo&s;t no new
idea that was &s;tarted, nor any hint that could be
improved. He had therefore made in coffee-hou&s;e$
the &s;ame pro$iciency as in other &s;tudies; and it is
remarkable, that the writings of a man of little
education and little reading have an air of learning
&s;carcely to be found in any other performances, but
which perhaps as often ob&s;cures as embelli&s;hes them.</P>
<P>His judgement was eminently exact both with re|gard
to writings and to men. The knowledge of
life was indeed his chief attainment, and it is not
without &s;ome &s;atisfaction, that I can produce the
<PB N="cxiii" REF="118">
&s;uffrage of Savage in favour of human nature, of
which he never appeared to entertain &s;uch odious
ideas, as &s;ome, who perhaps had neither his judgment
nor experience, have publi&s;hed, eitherin oftentation
of their &s;agacity, vindication of their crimes, or
gratification of their malice.</P>
<P>His method of life particularly qualified him for
conver&s;ation, of which he knew how to practi&s;e all
the graces. He was never vehement or loud, but
at once mode&s;t and ea&s;y, open and re&s;pectful; his
language was vivacious and elegant, and equally
happy upon grave or humorous &s;ubjects. He was
generally cen&s;ured for not knowing when to retire,
but that was not the defect of his judgment, but of
his fortune; when he left his company, he was fre|quently
to &s;pend the remaining part of the night in
the &s;treet, or at lea&s;t was abandoned to gloomy re|flections,
which it is not &s;trange that he delayed as
long as he could, and &s;ometimes forgot that he gave
others pain to avoid it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;aid, that he made u&s;e of his abilities
for the direction of his own conduct: an irregular
and di&s;&s;ipated manner of life had made him the &s;lave
of every pa&s;&s;ion that happened to be excited by the
pre&s;ence of its object, and that &s;lavery to his pa&s;|&s;ions
reciprocally produced a life irregular and di&s;|&s;ipated.
He was not ma&s;ter of his own motions
nor could promi&s;e any thing for the next day.</P>
<P>With regard to his economy, nothing can be
added to the relation of his life: He appeared to
think him&s;elf born to be &s;upported by others, and
di&s;pen&s;ed from all nece&s;&s;ity of providing for him&s;elf;
he therefore never pro&s;ecuted any &s;cheme of advan|tage,
nor endeavoured even to &s;ecure the profits
which his writings might have afforded him.</P>
<P>His temper was, in con&s;equence of the dominion
of his pa&s;&s;ions, uncertain and capricious; he was
ea&s;ily engaged, and ea&s;ily di&s;gu&s;ted; but he is ac|cu&s;ed
<PB N="cxiv" REF="119">
of retaining his hatred more tenaciou&s;ly than
his benevolence.</P>
<P>He was compa&s;&s;ionate both by nature and principle,
and always ready to perform offices of humanity;
but when he was provoked, and very &s;mall offences
were &s;ufficient to provoke him, he would pro&s;ecute
his revenge with the utmo&s;t acrimony till his pa&s;&s;ion
had &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>His friend&s;hip was therefore of little value; for
though he was zealous in the &s;upport or vindication
of tho&s;e whom he loved, yet it was always dan|gerous
to tru&s;t him, becau&s;e he con&s;idered him&s;elf
as di&s;charged by the fir&s;t quarrel from all ties of
honour or gratitude; and would betray tho&s;e &s;ecrets,
which, in the warmth of confidence, had been im|parted
to him. This practice drew upon him an
univer&s;al accu&s;ation of ingratitude; nor can it be
denied that he was very ready to &s;et him&s;elf free
from the load of an obligation; for he could not
bear to conceive him&s;elf in a &s;tat$ of dependance,
his pride being equally powerful with his other pa&s;|&s;ions,
and appearing in the form of in&s;olence at one
time, and of vanity at another. Vanity, the mo&s;t
innocent &s;pecies of pride, was mo&s;t frequently pre|dominant:
He could not ea&s;ily leave off, when he
had once began to mention him&s;elf, or his works;
nor ever read his ver&s;es without &s;tealing his eyes
from the page, to di&s;cover, in the faces of his audi|ence,
how they were affected with any favourite
pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>A kinder name than that of vanity ought to be
given to the delicacy with which he was always care|ful
to &s;eparate his own merit from every other man's,
and to reject that prai&s;e to which he had no claim.
He did not forget, in mentioning his performances,
to mark every line that had been &s;ugge&s;ted or amend|ed,
and was &s;o accurate, as to relate that he owed
<PB N="cxv" REF="120">
three words in THE WANDERER to the advice of
his friends.</P>
<P>His veracity was que&s;tioned, but with little rea&s;on;
his accounts, though not indeed always the &s;ame, were
generally con&s;i&s;tent. When he loved any man, he
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed all his faults; and when he had been
offended by him, concealed all his virtues: But his
characters were generally true, &s;o far as he pro|ceeded;
though it cannot be denied, that his partiality
might have &s;ometimes the effect of fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es indifferent he was zealous for virtue, truth,
and ju&s;tice: he knew very well the nece&s;&s;ity of good|ne&s;s
to the pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s of man|kind;
nor is there perhaps any writer, who has le&s;s
endeavoured to plea&s;e by flattering the appetites, or
perverting the judgment.</P>
<P>As an author, therefore, and he now cea&s;es to
influence mankind in any other character, if one
piece which he had re&s;olved to &s;uppre&s;s be excepted,
he has very little to fear from the &s;tricte&s;t moral or
religious cen&s;ure. And though he may not be alto|gether
&s;ecure again&s;t the objections of the critic, it
mu&s;t however be acknowledged, that his works are
the productions of a genius truly poetical; and,
what many writers who have been more lavi&s;hly
applauded cannot boa&s;t, that they have an original
air, which has no re&s;emblance of any foregoing
writer; that the ver&s;ification and &s;entiments have a
ca&s;t peculiar to them&s;elves, which no man can imi|tate
would in another be affectation. It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed
with &s;ucce&s;s, becau&s;e what was nature in Savage,
that his de&s;criptions are &s;triking, his images
animated, his fictions ju&s;tly imagined, and his alle|gories
artfully pur&s;ued; that his diction is elevated,
though &s;ometimes forced, and his numbers &s;onorous
and maje&s;tic, though frequently &s;luggi&s;h and en|cumbered.
Of his &s;tyle the general fault is har&s;h|ne&s;s,
and its general excellence is dignity; of his
<PB N="cxvi" REF="121">
&s;entiments the prevailing beauty is &s;ublimity, and
uniformity the prevailing defect.</P>
<P>For his life, or for his writings, none, who can|didly
con&s;ider his fortune, will think an apology
either nece&s;&s;ary or difficult. If he was not always
&s;ufficiently in&s;tructed in his &s;ubject, his knowledge
was at lea&s;t greater than could have been attained
by others in the &s;ame &s;tate. If his works were &s;ome|times
unfini&s;hed, accuracy cannot rea&s;onably be ex|acted
from a man oppre&s;&s;ed with want, which he
has no hope of relieving, but by a &s;peedy publica|tion.
The in&s;olence and re&s;entment of which he is
accu&s;ed, were not ea&s;ily to be avoided by a great
mind, irritated by perpetual hard&s;hips, and con|&s;trained
hourly to return the &s;purns of contempt,
and repre&s;s the in&s;olence of pro&s;perity; and vanity
may &s;urely readily be pardoned in him, to whom
life afforded no other comforts than barren prai&s;es,
and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erving them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are no proper judges of his conduct, who
have &s;lumbered away their time on the down of
a&s;&s;luence; nor will any wi&s;e man pre&s;ume to &s;ay,
&startq;Had I been in Savage's condition, I &s;hould have
lived or written better than Savage.&endq;</P>
<P>This relation will not be wholly without its u&s;e,
if tho&s;e, who langui&s;h under any part of his &s;uf|ferings,
&s;hall be enabled to fortify their patience,
by reflecting that they feel only tho&s;e afflictions from

<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis hard that a Spani&s;h woman can't have
an amour, but &s;ome jealous-pated father or brother
mu&s;t interfere with the honour of his family. Now
I have heard, that the Engli&s;h women may take
what diver&s;ion they plea&s;e, and be rather celebrated
<PB N="18" REF="138">
for their beauty, than cen&s;ur'd.&mdash;Nay, that the very
wives may have a whole equipage of lovers, and be
the more admired by their hu&s;bands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the nature of the climate, Madam; as
in France the coquet is rather admir'd for her airs,
than cen&s;ur'd for her inclinations. Not but there's
detraction in both climates; but there 'tis a plea&s;ure
peculiar to the women, where &s;candal pa&s;&s;es for wit,
and one beauty ri&s;es on the falling reputation of
another. The men, unle&s;s the beaus, have nothing
to do with it; and tho&s;e no farther, than a little
raillery for their diver&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd be as free as they had I the power&mdash;
For I have cho&s;e a per&s;on of my own liking, and
my father has contracted me to one that is indifferent
to me. Now, methinks, there's &s;uch a plea&s;ure in
the di&s;obedience, that it adds an eloquence to the
&s;uit of a lover.</P>

animal, a hu&s;band.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis want of courage in our lovers to put a
good cu&s;tom in practice, otherwi&s;e the jealous fury
of a Spani&s;h Don might in time be moderated to
the content of a London citizen.</P>

<P>I hope, my lord, I &s;hall never be &s;o

<SP>

<P>D'ye know him?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, my lord, and know him to
be a man of honour&mdash;I ow'd my life to him when
I was in England&mdash;and ever after there was &s;uch
a friend&s;hip between us, that during my continuance
there we were &s;eldom or never a&s;under.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear &s;o honourable a character

<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, that proceeds from the wild|ne&s;s
of his youth&mdash;we are all &s;ubject to &s;uch
faults&mdash;Sir Charles is what we e&s;teem a fine gen|tleman;

<SPEAKER>D. Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may: con&s;ider, to confine a young
gentleman from his plea&s;ures, is bla&s;ting him in the
bloom of his life&mdash;Be&s;ides, liberty is the very &s;oul
of the Engli&s;h, and they had rather &s;ubmit to ho|honourable
death, than bondage.</P>

<P>What can I do in this affair?</P>

<P>If your lord&s;hip will allow him to be a

<SP>

<P>My lord, I know the circum&s;tances of
the &s;tory, and the people concern'd in't, except the
young lady&mdash;therefore, if you $ll believe me, when
I left M$drid, the wounded cavalier was not actually
dead&mdash;nay, there was &s;ome hopes of his recovery.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles, I am come to you concerning
an affair of con&s;equence.&mdash;You mu&s;t know, Alon|zo,
the father of Fidelia, and I, when young,
were never &s;eparated from each other&mdash;Now, I
under&s;tand by a letter from Madrid, you have late|ly
depriv'd him of his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! depriv'd him of her, my lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; but methinks I would willingly heal
this breach&mdash;therefore I'd advi&s;e you to find &s;ome
<PB N="93" REF="213">
means, by which you might reconcile your&s;elf to
him, and re&s;tore the honour of the young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I under&s;tand you not&mdash;'Tis
true, I love Fidelia as my life; but for her honour,
it is not in the lea&s;t forfeited on my account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her father is of a quite contrary opinion.&mdash;
Therefore, if you have either a value for your&s;elf,
or an affection for the young lady, you will con&s;ent
to tho&s;e means, that will contribute to her ea&s;e, as
well as to your own &s;ecurity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I own the wildne&s;s of my
youth.&mdash;But I have &s;o true an affection for Fidelia,
that for my &s;ecurity, I prize it not in compari&s;on
with her content.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ee, Sir Charles, you begin to gue&s;s at
my meaning&mdash;Therefore I que&s;tion not but to
find you the man of honour, I was apt at fir&s;t &s;ight
to believe you&mdash;Her &s;ame upon your account is
very much become the di&s;cour&s;e of the world&mdash;
therefore to reconcile all, wou'd you be willing to
accept her for a wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, I needed not this preparation
to embrace &s;uch welcome propo&s;als.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Con&s;ent to that, and I'll engage your par|don
&s;hall be &s;ecur'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>My life is of as little value to me now,
as when I ran the ri&s;que of forfeiting it for her&mdash;
<PB N="94" REF="214">
But for the loo&s;er wi&s;hes that my incon&s;tancy has
been guilty of, cou'd I be &s;o happy to &s;ee her, they
wou'd immediately vani&s;h at her &s;ight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know then, Sir Charles, the lady is &s;till in

</SP>
<SP>

<P>How! in Valencia, my lord?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then there is a mi&s;take in this&mdash;
The lady that was taken with me, I can a&s;&s;ure
you, is not Fidelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her father's &s;ervant cou'd not be mi&s;taken,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know her face too well to be deceiv'd&mdash;
The lady that was taken with me, I was a &s;tranger
to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a pretty contrivance indeed!&mdash;
In the fir&s;t place, the young lady owns her&s;elf to
be Fidelia, but at the &s;ame time denies a corre&s;|pondence
with you&mdash;and now you own a corre&s;|pondence
with her, but deny &s;he is the per&s;on&mdash;
Who was it then that you had an a&s;&s;ignation with
la&s;t night at my hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you have made a di&s;covery in
that affair, 'twa$ with the lady that was &s;eiz'd
with me.</P>

<P>Now &s;he actually &s;ays &s;he is&mdash;but denies
that &s;he has either &s;een you, or had any di&s;cour&s;e
with you in Valencia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then, there is a farther my&s;tery in
this!&mdash;I am certain, the lady I met la&s;t night was
not Fidelia.&mdash;Now if the per&s;on you mean, that
denies all this, &s;hou'd prove to be her, then your
lord&s;hip is mi&s;taken, for &s;he can't be the &s;ame that
was &s;eiz'd with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, there has been no art magic to tran&s;|form
her, nor to change one per&s;on to another.&mdash;
Therefore depend on't, &s;he's the &s;ame&mdash;Now the
me&s;&s;enger from her father went away &s;atisfy'd &s;he

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE importunity of the Publi&s;her being
very pre&s;&s;ing, I omit the Preface, which I in|tended;
wherein I propo&s;ed, by way of E&s;&s;ay,
A DISCOURSE ON TRAGEDY: the &s;ubject be|ing
too copious to treat of, in this &s;hort time,
I defer it, either to publi&s;h it &s;ingle, or to join
it with &s;ome other work.</P>
<P>But my gratitude prompts me to declare
the obligations I have to my be&s;t and deare&s;t
friend, Mr. Aaron Hill, for his many judi|cious
corrections in this Tragedy. On that
worthy gentleman, who&s;e mind is enriched with
every noble &s;cience, and in who&s;e brea&s;t all
the virtues of humanity are compri&s;ed, it will
be my pride, to offer my &s;entiments in a more
di&s;tingui&s;hing manner hereafter.</P>
<P><PB REF="233">
I think it my duty al&s;o, to return thanks
to the town, for their favourable reception
of this play; and for the applau&s;e their indul|gence
be&s;tow'd on the performance of the
young actors: particularly, for my own &s;uc|ce&s;s,
in a double capacity, as actor and author,
I &s;hall ever publicly confe&s;s their genero&s;ity,
as it will ever prove my &s;ecret &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;advantage this play
may have received in the repre&s;entation, I can|not
omit acknowledging a debt of gratitude to
Mr. Theophilus Cibber, who was very care|ful
in the management of the rehear&s;als, and
endeavoured to in&s;truct every one concerned in
the play; a mechani&s;m, which my inexperi|ence,
as an actor, made me incapable of.</P>
<P>Though an author knows the meaning of his
&s;cenes, he may be unacquainted with a thea|trical
method of &s;etting them in the mo&s;t
advantageous appearance. Example enforces
<PB REF="234">
precept: and therefore, Mr. Cibber, junior,
took the noble&s;t method to improve others,
by doing ju&s;tice to his own character; and,
though he labours under the pre&s;ent di&s;advantage
of &s;mall &s;tature, I cannot help concurring with
the opinion of many others, that in action and
elocution, he is certainly a prodigy!</P>
