<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Hi&s;tory of this <HI>Beautiful
Lady,</HI> is to &s;peak for it&s;elf:
If it is not as Beautiful as the
Lady her&s;elf is reported to be;
if it is not as diverting as the
Reader can de&s;ire, and much
more than he can rea&s;onably expect; and if
all the mo&s;t diverting Parts of it are not a|dapted
to the In&s;truction and Improvement of
the Reader, the <HI>Relator &s;ays,</HI> it mu&s;t be from
the Defect of his Performance; dre&s;&s;ing up
the Story in wor&s;e Cloaths than the <HI>Lady,</HI>
who&s;e Words be &s;peaks, prepar'd it for the
World.</P>
<P>He takes the Liberty to &s;ay, That this
Story differs from mo&s;t of the Modern Per|formances
of this Kind, tho' &s;ome of them
have met with a very good Reception in the
World: I &s;ay, It differs from them in this
Great and E&s;&s;ential Article, <HI>Namely,</HI> That
the Foundation of This is laid in Truth of
<PB REF="3">
<HI>Fact;</HI> and &s;o the Work is not a Story, but a
Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The Scene is laid &s;o near the Place where
the Main Part of it was tran&s;acted, that it
was nece&s;&s;ary to conceal Names and Per&s;ons;
le&s;t what cannot be yet entirely forgot in that
Part of the Town, &s;hou'd be remember'd, and
the Facts trac'd back too plainly, by the many
People yet living, who wou'd know the Per|&s;ons
by the Particulars.</P>
<P>It is not always nece&s;&s;ary that the Names
of Per&s;ons &s;hou'd be di&s;cover'd, tho' the Hi|&s;tory
may be many Ways u&s;eful; and if we
&s;hou'd be always oblig'd to name the Per&s;ons,
or not to relate the Story, the Con&s;equence
might be only this, That many a plea&s;ant
and delightful Hi&s;tory wou'd be Buried in the
Dark, and the World be depriv'd both of the
Plea&s;ure and the Profit of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Writer</HI> &s;ays, He was particularly ac|quainted
with this Lady's Fir&s;t Hu&s;band, the
<HI>Brewer,</HI> and with his Father; and al&s;o,
with his Bad Circum&s;tances; and knows that
fir&s;t Part of the Story to be Truth.</P>
<P>This may, he hopes, be a Pledge for the
Credit of the re&s;t, tho' the Latter Part of
her Hi&s;tory lay Abroad, and cou'd not &s;o well
be vouch'd as the Fir&s;t; yet, as &s;he has told
it her&s;elf, we have the le&s;s Rea&s;on to que|&s;tion
the Truth of that Part al&s;o.</P>
<P>In the Manner &s;he has told the Story, it
is evident &s;he does not in&s;i&s;t upon her Ju&s;tifi|cation
<PB REF="4">
in any one Part of it; much le&s;s does
&s;he recommend her Conduct, or indeed, any
Part of it, except her Repentance to our
Imitation: On the contrary, &s;he makes fre|quent
Excur&s;ions, in a ju&s;t cen&s;uring and
condemning her own Practice: How often
does &s;he reproach her&s;elf in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;i|onate
Manner; and guide us to ju&s;t Re|flections
in the like Ca&s;es?</P>
<P>It is true, She met with unexpected Suc|ce&s;s
in all her wicked Cour&s;es; but even in
the highe&s;t Elevations of her Pro&s;perity, &s;he
makes frequent Acknowledgments, That the,
Plea&s;ure of her Wickedne&s;s was not worth
the Repentance; and that all the Satisfaction
&s;he had, all the Joy in the View of her Pro&s;|perity,
no, nor all the Wealth &s;he rowl'd in;
the Gayety of her Appearance; the Equi|pages,
and the Honours, &s;he was attended
with, cou'd quiet her Mind, abate the Re|proaches
of her Con&s;cience, or procure her
an Hour's Sleep, when ju&s;t Reflections kept
her waking.</P>
<P>The Noble Inferences that are drawn
from this one Part, are worth all the re&s;t of
the Story; and abundantly ju&s;tifie (as they
are the profe&s;s'd De&s;ign of) the Publica|tion.</P>
<P>If there are any Parts in her Story, which
being oblig'd to relate a wicked Action, &s;eem
to de&s;cribe it too plainly, the <HI>Writer</HI> &s;ays, all
imaginable Care has been taken to keep clear of
<PB REF="5">
Indecencies, and immode&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions; and
'tis hop'd you will find nothing to prompt a vi|cious
Mind, but every-where much to di&s;cou|rage
and expo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Scenes of Crime can &s;carce be repre&s;ented
in &s;uch a Manner, but &s;ome way make a Cri|minal
U&s;e of them; but when Vice is painted
in its Low-priz'd Colours, 'tis not to make
People in love with it, but to expo&s;e it; and if
the Reader makes a wrong U&s;e of the Figures,
the Wickedne&s;s is his own.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Advantages of the
pre&s;ent Work are &s;o great, and the Virtuous
Reader has room for &s;o much Improvement,
that we make no Question, the Story, how|ever
meanly told, will find a Pa&s;&s;age to his
be&s;t Hours; and be read both with Profit and
Delight.</P>

<HEAD>THE
Fortunate Mi&s;tre&s;s:
OR, A
HISTORY
OF
The Life, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_I Was BORN, <HI>as my Friends told me,</HI>
at the City of POICTIERS, in the
Province, or County of POICTOU,
in <HI>France,</HI> from whence I was brought
to <HI>England</HI> by my Parents, who fled
for their Religion about the Year 1683, when
the Prote&s;tants were Bani&s;h'd from <HI>France</HI> by the
Cruelty of their Per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>I, who knew little or nothing of what I was
brought over hither for, was well-enough pleas'd
with being here; <HI>London,</HI> a large and gay City,
<PB N="2" REF="7">
took with me mighty well, who, from my being
a Child; lov'd a Crowd, and to &s;ee a great-many
fine Folks.</P>
<P>I retain'd nothing of <HI>France,</HI> but the Language:
My Father and Mother being People of better
Fa&s;hion, than ordinarily the People call'd REFU|GEES
at that Time were; and having fled early,
while it was ea&s;ie to &s;ecure their Effects, had, be|fore
their coming over, remitted con&s;iderable Sums
of Money, or, <HI>as I remember,</HI> a con&s;iderable Va|lue
in <HI>French</HI> Brandy, Paper, and other Goods;
and the&s;e &s;elling very much to Advantage here,
my Father was in very good Circum&s;tances at his
coming over, &s;o that he was far from applying
to the re&s;t of our Nation that were here, for
Countenance and Relief: On the contrary, he had
his Door continually throng'd with mi&s;erable Ob|jects
of the poor &s;tarving Creatures, who at that
Time fled hither for Shelter, on Account of Con|&s;cience,
<HI>or &s;omething el&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I have indeed, heard my Father &s;ay, That he
was pe&s;ter'd with a great-many of tho&s;e, who, <HI>for
any Religion they had,</HI> might e'en have &s;tay'd where
they were, but who flock'd over hither in Droves,
for what they call in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a Livelihood; here|ing
with what Open Arms the REFUGEES were
receiv'd in <HI>England,</HI> and how they fell readily into
Bu&s;ine&s;s, being, by the charitable A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
People in <HI>London,</HI> encourag'd to Work in their Ma|nufactures,
in <HI>Spittle-Fields, Canterbury,</HI> and other
Places; and that they had a much better Price for
their Work, than in <HI>France, and the like.</HI></P>
<P>My Father, <HI>I &s;ay, told me,</HI> That he was more
$word$ with the Clamours of the&s;e People, than
of tho&s;e who were truly REFUGEES, and fled
in Di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>merely for C$n&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="8">
I was about ten Years old when I was brought
over hither, where, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> my Father liv'd
in very good Circum&s;tances, and died in about
eleven Years more; in which time, as I had ac|compli&s;h'd
my&s;elf for the &s;ociable Part of the
World, &s;o I had acquainted my&s;elf with &s;ome of
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Neighbours, as is the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Lon|don;</HI>
and as, while I was Young, I had pick'd-up
three or four Play-Fellows and Companions, &s;uita|ble
to my Years; &s;o as we grew bigger, we learnt
to call one-another Intimates and Friends; and
this forwarded very much the fini&s;hing me for
Conver&s;ation, and the World.</P>
<P>I went to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Schools, and being young, I
learnt the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue perfectly well, with all the
Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Young-Women; &s;o that I
retain'd nothing of the <HI>French,</HI> but the Speech; nor
did I &s;o much as keep any Remains of the <HI>French</HI>
Language tagg'd to my Way of Speaking, <HI>as mo&s;t
Foreigners do,</HI> but &s;poke what we call Natural <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI>
as if I had been born here.</P>
<P>Being to give my own Character, I mu&s;t be ex|cus'd
to give it as impartially as po&s;&s;ible, and as
if I was &s;peaking of another-body; <HI>and the Se|quel
will lead you to judge whether I flatter my&s;elf
or no.</HI></P>
<P>I was (<HI>&s;peaking of my&s;elf as about Fourteen Years
of Age</HI>) tall, and very well made; &s;harp as a
Hawk in Matters of common Knowledge; quick
and &s;mart in Di&s;cour&s;e; apt to be Satyrical;
full of Repartee, and a little too forward in Con|ver&s;ation;
or, as we call it in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> BOLD,
tho' perfectly Mode&s;t in my Behaviour. Being
<HI>French</HI> Born, I danc'd, <HI>as &s;ome &s;ay,</HI> naturally, lov'd
it extremely, and &s;ung well al&s;o, and &s;o well, that,
<HI>as you will hear,</HI> it was afterwards &s;ome Advantage
to me: With all the&s;e Things, I wanted neither
<PB N="4" REF="9">
Wit, Beauty, or Money. In this Manner I &s;et out
into the World, having all the Advantages that
any Young Woman cou'd de&s;ire, to recommend
me to others, and form a Pro&s;pect of happy Li|ving
to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>At about Fifteen Years of Age, my Father gave
me, <HI>as he call'd it in</HI> French, 25000 Livres, <HI>that
is to &s;ay,</HI> two Thou&s;and Pounds portion, and mar|ried
me to an Eminent Brewer in the City; <HI>par|don
me if I conceal his Name, for tho' he was the
Foundation of my Ruin, I cannot take &s;o &s;evere a Re|venge
upon him.</HI></P>
<P>With this Thing call'd a Husband, I liv'd
eight Years in good Fa&s;hion, and for &s;ome Part
of the Time, kept a Coach, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> a kind
of Mock-Coach; for all the Week the Hor&s;es
were kept at Work in the Dray-Carts, but on
<HI>Sunday</HI> I had the Privilege to go Abroad in my
Chariot, either to Church, or otherways, as my
Husband and I cou'd agree about it; which, <HI>b$
the way,</HI> was not very often: But of that here|after.</P>
<P>Before I proceed in the Hi&s;tory of the Marry'd
Part of my Life, you mu&s;t allow me to give as
impartial an Account of my Husband, as I have
done of my&s;elf: He was a jolly, hand&s;ome Fel|low,
as any Woman need wi&s;h for a Companion;
tall, and well made; rather a little too large, but
not &s;o as to be ungentile; he danc'd well, which,
<HI>I think,</HI> was the fir&s;t thing that brought us to|gether:
He had an old Father, who manag'd the
Bu&s;ine&s;s carefully, &s;o that he had little of that
Part lay on him, but now-and-then to appear, and
&s;how him&s;elf; and he took the Advantage of it,
for he troubl'd him&s;elf very little about it, but
went Abroad, kept Company, hunted much, and
lov'd it exceedingly.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10">
After I have told you that he was a Hand&s;ome
Man, and a good Sport&s;man, I have, indeed, &s;aid
all; and unhappy was I, like other young Peo|ple
of our Sex, I cho&s;e him for being a hand|&s;ome,
jolly Fellow, as I have &s;aid; for he was o|therwi&s;e
a weak, empty-headed, untaught Crea|ture,
as any Woman could ever de&s;ire to be cou|pled
with: And here I mu&s;t take the Liberty,
whatever I have to reproach my&s;elf with in my
after-Conduct, to turn to my Fellow-Creatures,
the Young Ladies of this Country, and &s;peak to
them, by way of Precaution, If you have any
Regard to your future Happine&s;s any View of
living comfortably with a Husband; any Hope
of pre&s;erving your Fortunes, or re&s;toring them af|ter
any Di&s;a&s;ter; Never, Ladies, marry a Fool;
any Husband rather than a Fool; with &s;ome o|ther
Husbands you may be unhappy, but with a
Fool you will be mi&s;erable; with another Hus|band
you <HI>may,</HI> I &s;ay, be unhappy, but with a
Fool you <HI>mu&s;t;</HI> nay, if he wou'd, he cannot make
you ea&s;ie; every thing he does is &s;o awkward,
every thing he &s;ays is &s;o empty, a Woman of
any Sence cannot but be &s;urfeited, and &s;ick of
him twenty times a-Day: What is more &s;hock|ing,
than for a Woman to bring a hand&s;ome,
comely Fellow of a Husband, into Company, and
then be oblig'd to Blu&s;h for him every time &s;he
hears him &s;peak? To hear other Gentlemen talk
Sence, and he able to &s;ay nothing? And &s;o look
like a Fool, or, which is wor&s;e, hear him talk
Non&s;ence, and be laugh'd at for a Fool.</P>
<P>In the next Place, there are &s;o many Sorts of
Fools, &s;uch an infinite Variety of Fools, and
&s;o hard it is to know the Wor&s;t of the Kind,
that I am oblig'd to &s;ay, No Fool, Ladies, at
all, no kind of Fool; whether a mad Fool, or a
<PB N="6" REF="11">
&s;ober Fool, a wi&s;e Fool, or a &s;illy Fool; take a|ny
thing but a Fool; <HI>nay, be</HI> any thing, be even
an Old Maid, the wor&s;t of Nature's Cur&s;es, rather
than take up with a Fool.</P>
<P>But to leave this a-while, for I &s;hall have Occa|&s;ion
to &s;peak of it again my Ca&s;e was particu|larly
hard, for I had a Variety of fooli&s;h Things
complicated in this unhappy Match.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> and which, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is very un&s;uf|ferable,
he was a conceited Fool, <HI>Tout Opiniatre,</HI>
every thing he &s;aid, was Right, was Be&s;t, and was
to the Purpo&s;e, whoever was in Company, and
whatever was advanc'd, by others, tho' with the
greate&s;t Mode&s;ty imaginable; and yet when he
came to defend what he had &s;aid, by Argument
and Rea&s;on, he would do it &s;o weakly, &s;o emptily,
and &s;o nothing to the Purpo&s;e, that it was enough
to make any-body that heard him, &s;ick and a|&s;ham'd
of him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He was po&s;itive and ob&s;tinate, and
the mo&s;t po&s;itive in the mo&s;t &s;imple and in|con&s;i&s;tent
Things, &s;uch as were intollerable to
bear.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Articles, if there had been no more,
qualified him to be a mo&s;t unbearable Creature
for a Husband, and &s;o it may be &s;uppos'd at fir&s;t
Sight, what a kind of Life I led with him:
However, I did as well as I could, and held my
Tongue, which was the only Victory I gain'd
over him; for when he would talk after his
own empty rattling Way with me, and I would
not an&s;wer, or enter into Di&s;cour&s;e with him
on the Point he was upon, he would ri&s;e up in
the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion imaginable, and go away;
which was the cheape&s;t Way I had to be deli|ver'd.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">
I could enlarge here much, upon the Method I
took to make my Life pa&s;&s;able and ea&s;ie with the
mo&s;t incorrigible Temper in the World; but it is
too long, and the Articles too trifling: I &s;hall
mention &s;ome of them as the Circum&s;tances I am
to relate, &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily bring, them in.</P>
<P>After I had been Married about four Years,
my own Father died, my Mother having been
dead before; he lik'd my Match &s;o ill, and &s;aw
&s;o little Room to be &s;atisfied with the Conduct
of my Husband, that tho' he left me 5000 Li|vres,
and more at his Death, yet he left it in the
Hands of my Elder Brother, who running on too
ra&s;hly in his Adventures, as a Merchant, fail'd,
and lo&s;t not only what he had, but what he had
for me too; as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Thus I lo&s;t the la&s;t Gift of my Father's Bounty,
by having a Husband not fit to be tru&s;ted with
it; there's one of the Benefits of marrying a Fool.</P>
<P>Within two Years after my own Father's Death,
my Husbands Father al&s;o died, and, as I thought,
left him a con&s;iderable Addition to his E&s;tate, the
whole Trade of the Brewhou&s;e, which was a very
good one, being now his own.</P>
<P>But this Addition to his Stock was his Ruin,
for he had no Genius to Bu&s;ine&s;s; he had no
Knowledge of his Accounts; he bu&s;tled a little
about; it indeed, at fir&s;t, and put on a Face of
Bu&s;ine&s;s, but he &s;oon grew flack it was below him
to in&s;pect his Books, he committed all that to his
Clerks and Book-Keepers; and while he &s;ound
Money in Ca&s;h to pay the Malt-Man, and the
Excie, and put fome in his Pocket, he was perfect|ly
ea&s;ie and indolent, let the main Chance go how
it would.</P>
<P>I fore&s;aw the Con&s;equence of this, and at|tempted
&s;everal times to per&s;wade him to apply
<PB N="8" REF="13">
him&s;elf to his Bu&s;ine&s;s I put him in Mind how
his Cu&s;tomers complain'd of the Neglect of his
Servants on one hand, and how abundance Broke
in his Debt, on the other hand, for want of the
Clerk's Care to &s;ecure him, <HI>and the like;</HI> but he
thru&s;t me by, either with hard Words, or fraudu|lently,
with repre&s;enting the Ca&s;es otherwi&s;e than
they were.</P>
<P>However, to cut &s;hort a dull Story, which
ought not to be long, he began to find his Trade
&s;unk, his Stock declin'd, and that, in &s;hort, he
could not carry on his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and once or twice
his Brewing Uten&s;ils were extended for the Ex|ci&s;e;
and the la&s;t Time he was put to great Extre|mities
to clear them.</P>
<P>This allarm'd him, and he re&s;olv'd to lay down
his Trade; which, indeed, I was not &s;orry for;
fore&s;eeing that if he did not lay it down in Time;
he would be forc'd to do it another Way, namely,
as a Bankrupt. Al&s;o I was willing he &s;hould draw
out while he had &s;omething left, left &s;hould come
to be &s;tript at Home, and be turn'd out of Doors
with my Children; for I had now five Children
by him; the only Work (perhaps) that Fools are
good for.</P>
<P>I thought my&s;elf happy when he got another
Man to take his Brewhou&s;e clear off of his Hands;
for paying down a large Sum of Money, my
Husband found him&s;elf a clear Man, all his Debts
Paid, and with between Two and Three Thou|&s;and
Pound in his Pocket; and being now o|blig'd
to remove from the Brewhou&s;e, we took a
Hou&s;e at&mdash;, a Village about two Miles out of
Town; and happy I thought my&s;elf, all things
con&s;ider'd, that I was got off clear, upon &s;o good
Terms; and had my hand&s;ome Fellow had but one
Cap full or Wit, I had been &s;till well enough.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14">
I propos'd to him either to buy &s;ome Place with
the Money, or with Part of it, and offer'd to
join my Part to it, which was then in Being, and
might have been &s;ecur'd; &s;o we might have
liv'd tollerably, at lea&s;t, during his Life. But as
it is the Part of a Fool to be void of Council, &s;o
he neglected it, liv'd on as he did before, kept his
Hor&s;es and Men, rid every Day out to the Fo|re&s;t
a Hunting, and nothing was done all this
while; but the Money decreas'd apace, and I
thought I &s;aw my Ruin ha&s;tening on, without any
po&s;&s;ible Way to prevent it.</P>
<P>I was not wanting with all that Per&s;wa&s;ions
and Entreaties could perform, but it was all fruit|le&s;s;
repre&s;enting to him how fa&s;t our Mo|ney
wa&s;ted, and what would be our Condition
when it was gone, made no Impre&s;&s;ion on him:
but like one &s;tupid, he went on, not valuing all
that Tears and Lamentations could be &s;uppos'd.
to do; nor did he abate his Figure or Equi|page,
his Hor&s;es or Servants, even to the la&s;t;
till he had not a Hundred Pound left in the whole
World.</P>
<P>It was not above three Years that all the Rea|dy-Money
was thus &s;pending off; yet he &s;pent
it, as I may &s;ay, fooli&s;hly too, for he kept no
valuable Company neither but; generally with
Hunt&s;men and Hor&s;e-Cour&s;ers, and Men meaner
than him&s;elf which is another Con&s;equence of
a Man's being a Fool; &s;uch can never take De|light
in Men more wi&s;e and capable than them|&s;elves;
and that makes them conver&s;e with Scoun|drels,
drink Belch with Porters, and keep Company
always below them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This was my wretched Condition, when one
Morning my Husband told me, he was &s;en|&s;ible
he was come to a mi&s;erable Condition, and
<PB N="10" REF="15">
he would go and &s;eek his Fortune &s;omewhere or
other; he had &s;aid &s;omething to that Purpo&s;e
&s;everal times before that, upon my pre&s;&s;ing him to
con&s;ider his Circum&s;tances, and the Circum&s;tan|ces
of his Family before it &s;hould be too late: But
as I found he had no Meaning in any thing of
that Kind, as indeed, he had not much in any
thing he ever &s;aid; &s;o I thought they were but
Words of Cour&s;e now: When he &s;aid he wou'd
be gone, I us'd to wi&s;h &s;ecretly, and even &s;ay in my
Thoughts, <HI>I wi&s;h you wou'd, for if you go on thus,
you will &s;tarve us all.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;taid, however, at home all that Day, and
day at home that Night; early the next Morning
he gets out of Bed, goes to a Window which
look'd out towards the Stables, and founds his
<HI>French</HI> Hom, as he called it; which was his u&s;ual
Signal to call his Men to go out a hunting.</P>
<P>It was about the latter-end of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and &s;o
was light yet at five a-Clock, and it was about
that Time that I heard him and his two Men go
out and &s;hut the Yard-Gates after them. He &s;aid
nothing to me more than as u&s;ual when he us'd
to go out upon his Sport neither did I ri&s;e, or
&s;ay any thing to him that was material, but went
to-&s;leep again after he was gone, for two Hours, or
thereabouts.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be a little &s;urprizing to the Reader to
tell him at once, that after this, I never &s;aw my
Husband more; but to go farther, I not only ne|ver
&s;aw him more, but I never heard from him, or
of him, neither of any or either of his two Ser|vants,
or of the Hor&s;es, either what became of
them, where, or which Way they went, or what
they did, or intended to do, no more than if the
Ground had open'd and &s;wall'd them all up,
and no-body had known it; except as hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16">
I was not, for the fir&s;t Night or two, at-all
&s;urpriz'd, no nor very much the fir&s;t Week or
two, believing that if anything Evil had befallen
them, I &s;hould &s;oon enough have heard of that;
and al&s;o knowing that as he had two Servants and
three Hor&s;es with him, it would be the &s;trange&s;t
Thing in the World that any thing could befal
them all, but that I mu&s;t &s;ome time or other hear
of them.</P>
<P>But you will ea&s;ily allow, that as Time run on a
Week, two Weeks, a Month, two Months, and &s;o
on, I was dreadfully frighted at la&s;t, and the more
when I look'd into my own Circum&s;tances, and
con&s;ider'd the Condition in which I was left;
with five Children, and not one Farthing Sub|&s;tance
for them, other than about &s;eventy Pound
in Money, and what few Things of Value I had
about me, which, tho' con&s;iderable in them&s;elves,
were yet nothing to feed a Family, and for a
length of Time too.</P>
<P>What to do I knew not, nor to whom to have
recour&s;e; to keep in the Hou&s;e where I was, I
could not, the Rent being too great; and to leave
it without his Order, if my Husband &s;hould re|turn,
I could not think of that neither; &s;o that I
continued extremely perplex'd, melancholly, and
di&s;courag'd, to the la&s;t Degreec.</P>
<P>I remain'd in this dejected Condition near a
Twelvemonth. My Husband had two Si&s;ters,
who were married, and liv'd very well, and &s;ome
other near Relations that I knew of, and I hop'd
would do &s;omething for me; and I frequently
&s;ent to the&s;e, to know if they could give me any
Account of my vagrant Creature; but they all
declared to me in An&s;wer, That they knew no|thing
about him; and after frequent &s;ending,
began to think me trouble&s;ome, and to let me
<PB N="12" REF="17">
know they thought &s;o too, by their treating my
Maid with very &s;light and unhand&s;ome Returns
To her Inquiries.</P>
<P>This grated hard, and added to my Affliction,
but I had no recour&s;e but to my Tears, for I had
not a Friend of my own left me in the World:
I &s;hould have ob&s;erv'd, that it was about
half a Year before this Elopement of my Hus|band,
that the Di&s;a&s;ter I mention'd above be$el
my Brother; who Broke, and that in &s;uch bad
Circum&s;tances, that I had the Mortification to
hear not only that he was in Pri&s;on, but that
there would be little or nothing to be had by
Way of Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Misfortunes &s;eldom come alone: This was the
Forerunner of my Husband's Flight; and as my
Expectations were cut off on that Side, my Hus|band
gone, and my Family of Children on my
Hands, and nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them, my Condi|tion
was the mo&s;t deplorable that Words can ex|pre&s;s.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome Plate and &s;ome Jewels, as might
be &s;uppo&s;ed, my Fortune and former Circum|&s;tances
con&s;ider'd; and my Husband, who had
never &s;taid to be di&s;tre&s;s'd, had not been put to
the Nece&s;&s;ity of rifling me, as Husbands u&s;ually
do in &s;uch Ca&s;es: But as I had &s;een an End of
all the Ready-Money, during the long Time I
had liv'd in a State of Expectation for my Hus|band,
&s;o I began to make away one Thing after
another, till tho&s;e few Things of Value which I
had, began to le&s;&s;en apace, and I &s;aw nothing but
Mi&s;ery and the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s before me, even
to have my Children &s;tarve before my Face; I
leave any one that is a Mother of Children, and
has liv'd in Plenty and good Fa&s;hion, to con&s;ider
and reflect, what mu&s;t be my Condition: As to
<PB N="13" REF="18">
my Husband, I had now no Mope or Expectation
of &s;eeing him any more; and, indeed, if I had,
he was the Man, of all the Men in the World, the
lea&s;t able to help me, or to have turn'd his hand
to the gaining one Shilling towards le&s;&s;ening our
Di&s;tre&s;s; he neither had the Capacity or the In|clination;
he could have been no Clerk, for he
&s;carce wrote a legible Hand; he was &s;o far from
being able to write Sence, that he could not
make Sence of what others wrote; he was &s;o far
from under&s;tanding good <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that he could
not &s;pell good <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> To be out of all Bu&s;ine&s;s
was his Delight; and he wou'd &s;tand leaning a|gain&s;t
a Po&s;t for half an Hour together, with a Pipe
in his Mouth, with all the Tranquillity in the
World, &s;moaking, like Dryden's <HI>Countryman that
Whi&s;tled as he went, for want of Thought;</HI> and this
even when his Family was, as it were &s;tarving,
that little be had wa&s;ting, and that we were all
bleeding to Death; he not knowing, and as little
con&s;idering, where to get another Shilling when
the la&s;t was &s;pent.</P>
<P>This being his Temper, and the Extent of his
Capacity, I confe&s;s I did not &s;ee &s;o much Lo&s;s in
his parting with me, as at fir&s;t I thought I did;
tho' it was hard and cruel, to the la&s;t Degree in
him, not giving me the lea&s;t Notice of his De|&s;ign;
and, indeed, that which I was mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;h'd
at, was, that &s;eeing he mu&s;t certainly have
intended this Excur&s;ion &s;ome few Moments at
lea&s;t, before he put it in Practice, yet he did
not come and take what little Stock of Money
we had left; or at lea&s;t, a Share of it, to bear
his Expence for a little while, but he did not;
and I am morally certain he had not five Guineas
with him in the World, when he went away I
All that I could come to the Knowledge of, about
<PB N="14" REF="19">
him, was, that he left his Hunting-Horn, which he
call'd the <HI>French</HI> Horn, in the Stable, and his
Hunting Saddle, went away in a hand&s;ome Fur|niture,
as they call it, which he u&s;ed &s;ometimes
to Travel with; having an embroidered Hou&s;ing,
a Ca&s;e of Pi&s;tols, and other things belonging to
them; and one of his Servants had another Sad|dle
with Pi&s;tols, though plain; and the other a
long Gun; &s;o that they did not go out as Sport&s;|men,
but rather as Travellers; What Part of
the World they went to, I never heard for ma|ny
Years.</P>
<P>As I have &s;aid, I &s;ent to his Relations, but
they &s;ent me &s;hort and &s;urly An&s;wers; nor did
any one of them offer to come to &s;ee me, or to
&s;ee the Children, or &s;o much as to enquire after
them, well perceiving that I was in a Condition,
that was likely to be &s;oon trouble&s;ome to them:
But it was no Time now to dally with them, or
with the World; I left off &s;ending to them, and
went my&s;elf among them; laid my Circum&s;tances
open to them, told them my whole Ca&s;e, and the
Condition I was reduc'd to, begg'd they would
advi&s;e me what Cour&s;e to take, laid my&s;elf as
low as they could de&s;ire, and intreated them to.
con&s;ider that I was not in a Condition to help my|&s;elf
and that without &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we mu&s;t
all inevitably peri&s;h: I told them, that if I had
had but one Child, or two Children, I would
have done my Endeavour to have work'd for
them with my Needle, and &s;hould only have
come to them to beg them to help me to &s;ome
Work, that I might get our Bread by my La|bour;
but to think of one &s;ingle Woman not
bred to Work, and at a Lo&s;s where to get Em|ployment,
to get the Bread of five Children, that
was not po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome of my Children being
<PB N="15" REF="20">
young too, and none of them big enough, to help
one another.</P>
<P>It was all one, I receiv'd not one Farthing of
A&s;&s;i&s;tance from any-body, was hardly ask'd to &s;it
down at the two Si&s;ters Hou&s;es, nor offered to
Eat or Drink at two more near Relations. The
Fifth, an Ancient Gentlewoman, Aunt-in-Law
to my Husband, a Widow, and the lea&s;t able
al&s;o of any of the re&s;t, did, indeed, ask me to
&s;it down, gave me a Dinner, and refre&s;h'd me
with a kinder Treatment than any of the re&s;t;
but added the melancholly Part, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;he
would have help'd me, but that, indeed, &s;he was
not able which, however, I was &s;atisfied was
very true.</P>
<P>Here I reliev'd my&s;elf with the con&s;tant A&s;|&s;i&s;tant
of the Afflicted, I mean Tears; for, rela|ting
to her how I was received by the other of
my Husband's Relations, it made me bur&s;t into
Tears, and I cry'd vehemently for a great while
together, till I made the good old Gentlewoman
cry too &s;everal times.</P>
<P>However, I came home from them all without
any Relief, and went on at home till I was re|duc'd
to &s;uch inexpre&s;&s;ible Di&s;tre&s;s, that it is not
to be de&s;crib'd: I had been &s;everal times after
this at the old Aunt's for I prevail'd with her
to promi&s;e me to go and talk with the other
Relations at lea&s;t, that, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;he could
bring &s;ome of them to take off the Children,
or to contribute &s;omething towards their Main|tenance;
and, to do her Ju&s;tice, &s;he did u&s;e her
Endeavour with them, but all was to no Pur|po&s;e,
they would do nothing, at lea&s;t that Way:
I think, with much Entreaty, &s;he obtain'd by a
kind of Collection among them all, about eleven
or twelve Shillings in Money; which, tho' it was a
<PB N="16" REF="21">
pre&s;ent Comfort, was yet not to be nam'd as capa|ble
to deliver me from any Part of the Load that
lay upon me.</P>
<P>There was a poor Woman that had been a kind
of a Dependant upon our Family, and who I had
often, among the re&s;t of the Relations, been very
kind to; my Maid put it into my Head one
Morning to &s;end to this poor Woman, and to &s;ee
whether &s;he might not be able to help, in this
dreadful Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t remember it here, to the Prai&s;e of this poor
Girl, my Maid, that tho' I was not able to give her
any Wages, and had told her &s;o, nay I was not able
to pay her the Wages that I was in Arrears to her, yet
&s;he would not leave me; nay, and as long as &s;he
had any Money, when I had none, the would help
me out of her own; for which, tho' I acknowleg'd
her Kindne&s;s and Fidelity, yet it was but a bad Coin
that &s;he was paid in at la&s;t, as will appear in its Place.</P>
<P><HI>AMY,</HI> (for that was her Name) put it into
my Thoughts to &s;end for this poor Woman to
come to me, for I was now in great Di&s;tre&s;s, and
I re&s;olv'd to do &s;o; but ju&s;t the very Morning that
I intended it, the old Aunt, with the poor Wo|man
in her Company, came to &s;ee me; the good
old Gentlewoman was, it &s;eems, heartily concern'd
for me, and had been talking again among tho&s;e
People, to &s;ee what &s;he could do for me; but to
very little Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>You &s;hall judge a little of my pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s
by the Po&s;ture &s;he found me in: I had five lit|tle
Children, the Elde&s;t was under ten Years
old, and I had not one Shilling in the Hou&s;e to
buy them Victuals, but had &s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> out with
a Silver Spoon, to &s;ell it, and bring home &s;ome
thing from the Butcher's; and I was in a Par|lour,
&s;itting on the Ground, with a great Heap
<PB N="17" REF="22">
of old Rags, Linnen, and other things about me,
looking them over, to &s;ee if I had any thing among
them that would Sell or Pawn for a little Money,
and had been crying ready to bur&s;t my&s;elf, to think
what I &s;hould do next.</P>
<P>At this Juncture they knock'd at the Door, I
thought it had been <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;o I did not ri&s;e up,
but one of the Children open'd the Door, and
they came directly into the Room where I was, and
where they found me in that Po&s;ture, and crying
vehemently, as above I was &s;urpriz'd at their co|ming,
you may be &s;ure e&s;pecially &s;eeing the Per&s;on
I had but ju&s;t before re&s;olv'd to &s;end for: But
when they &s;aw me; how I look'd, for my Eyes
were &s;well'd with crying, and what a Condition
I was in as to the Hou&s;e, and the Heaps of Things
that were about me, and especially when I told
them what I was doing, and on what Occa&s;ion,
they &s;at down like <HI>Job</HI>'s three Comforters, and
&s;aid not one Word to the for a great while, but
both of them cry'd as fa&s;t, and as heartily as I did.</P>
<P>The Truth was, there was no Need of much
Di&s;cour&s;e in the Ca&s;e, the Thing &s;poke it &s;elf;
they &s;aw me in Rags and Dirt, who was but a
little before riding in my Coach; thin, and look|ing
almo&s;t like one Starv'd, who was before fat
and beautiful: The Hou&s;e, that Was before hand|&s;omely
furni&s;h'd with pictures and Ornaments,
Cabinets, Peir-Gla&s;&s;es, and every thing &s;uita|ble,
was now &s;tripp'd, and naked, mo&s;t of the
Goods having been &s;eiz'd by the Landlord for
Rent, or &s;old to buy Nece&s;&s;aries; in a word, all
was Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s, the Face of Ruin was
every where to be &s;een; we had eaten up almo&s;t e|very
thing, and little remain'd, unle&s;s, like one of
the pitiful Women of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> I &s;hould cat up
my very Children them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="23">
After the&s;e two good Creatures had &s;at, as I
&s;ay, in Silence &s;ome time, and had then look'd
about them, my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> came in, and brought
with her a &s;mall Brea&s;t of Mutton, and two great
Bunches of Turnips, which &s;he intended to &s;tew
for our Dinner: As for me, my Heart was &s;o
overwhelm'd at &s;eeing the&s;e two Friends, for &s;uch
they were, tho' poor, and at their &s;eeing me in
&s;uch a Condition, that I fell into another violent
Fit of Crying; &s;o that, in &s;hort, I could not &s;peak
to them again for a great while longer.</P>
<P>During my being in &s;uch an Agony, they went
to my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> at another Part of the &s;ame
Room, and talk'd with her: <HI>Amy</HI> told them all
my Circum&s;tances, and &s;et them forth in &s;uch
moving Terms, and &s;o to the Life, that I could not
upon any Terms have done it like her my&s;elf, and
in a Word, affected them both with it in &s;uch a
manner, that the old Aunt came to me, and tho'
hardly able to &s;peak for Tears: Look ye, Cou&s;in,
&s;aid &s;he, in a few Words, Things mu&s;t not &s;tand
thus; &s;ome Cour&s;e mu&s;t be taken, and that forth|with;
pray where were the&s;e Children born? I
told her the Pari&s;h where we liv'd before, that four
of them were born there; and one in the Hou&s;e
where I now was, where the Landlord, after ha|ving
&s;ieiz'd my Goods for the Rent pa&s;t not then
knowing my Circum&s;tances, had now given me leave
to live for a whole Year more without any Rent,
being moved with Compa&s;&s;ion; but that this
Year was now almo&s;t expir'd.</P>
<P>Upon hearing this Account, they came to this
Re&s;olution: That the Children &s;hould be all car|ried
by them to the Door of one of the Relati|ons
mention'd above, and be &s;et down there by
the Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and that I, the Mother, &s;hould
remove for &s;ome Days, &s;hut up the Doors, and
<PB N="19" REF="24">
be gone; that the People &s;hould be told, That if
they did not think fit to to take &s;ome Care ofthe
Children, they might &s;end for the Church-Wardens
if they thought that, better; for that they were
born in that Pari&s;h, and there they mu&s;t be provi|ded
for; as for the other Child which was born
in the Pari&s;h of&mdash;, that was already taken Care
of by the Pari&s;h-Officers there; for, indeed, they
were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Family, that
they had, at fir&s;t Word, done what was their Part
to do.</P>
<P>This was what the&s;e good Women propos'd,
and bade me leave the re&s;t to them. I was at
fir&s;t, &s;adly afflicted at the Thoughts of parting
with my Children, and e&s;pecially at that ter|rible
thing, their being taken, into the Pari&s;h-keep|ing;
and then a hundred terrible things came
into my Thoughts; <HI>viz.</HI> of Pari&s;h-Children being
Starv'd at Nur&s;e; of their being ruin'd, let grow
crooked, lam'd, and the like, for want of being
taken care of; and this &s;unk my very Heart with|in
me.</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;ery of my own Circum&s;tance hard|ned
my Heart again&s;t my own Fle&s;h and Blood;
and when I con&s;ider'd they mu&s;t inevitably be
Starv'd, and I too, if I continued to keep them
about me, I began to be reconcil'd to parting
with them all, any how, and any where, that I
might be freed from the dreadful Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ee|ing
them all peri&s;h, and peri&s;hing with them my|&s;elf:
So I agreed to go away out of the Hou&s;e,
and leave the Management of the whole Matter to
my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and to them, and accordingly I
did &s;o; and the &s;ame Afternoon they carried them
all away to one of their <HI>Aunts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> a re&s;olute Girl, knock'd at the Door,
with the Children all with her, and bade the
<PB N="20" REF="25">
Elde&s;t, as &s;oon as the Door was open run in, and
the re&s;t after her: She &s;et them all down at the
Door before &s;he knocked, and when &s;he knock'd,
&s;he &s;taid till a Maid-Servant came to the Door;
Sweetheart, &s;aid &s;he, pray go in and tell your
Mi&s;tre&s;e, here are her little Coufins come to &s;ee

Child, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> take one of 'em in your Hand,
And I'll bring the re&s;t; &s;o &s;he gives her the lea&s;t,
And the Wench goes in mighty innocently, with
the Little One in her Hand, upon which <HI>Amy</HI> turns
the re&s;t in after her, &s;huts the Door &s;oftly, and
marches off as fa&s;t as &s;he cou'd.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t in the Interval of this, and even while the
Maid and her Mi&s;tre&s;e were quarrelling, for the
Mi&s;tre&s;s rav'd and &s;colded at her like a Mad|Woman,
and had ordered her to go and &s;top the
Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and turn all the Children out of the
Doors again; but &s;he had been at the Door, and
<HI>Amy</HI> was gone, and the Wench, was out of her
Wits, and the Mi&s;tre&s;s too: I &s;ay, ju&s;t at this
Juncture came die poor old Woman, not the Aunt,
But the other of the two that had been with me,
and knocks at the Door; the Aunt did not go,
becau&s;e &s;he had pretended to Advocate for me,
and they would have &s;u&s;pected her of &s;ome Con|trivance;
but as for the other Woman, they did
not &s;o much as know that &s;he had kept up any
Corre&s;pondence with me.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> and &s;he had concerted this between them,
and it was well enough contriv'd that they did &s;o
When &s;he came into the Hou&s;e, the Mi&s;tre&s;s was

upon me, and tells me, that a Wench brought
them to the Door, and thru&s;t them in, and bade
her carry them to me; but it &s;hall be no Di|&s;turbance
to me, for I have order'd them to be
&s;et in the Street, without the Door, and &s;o let the
Church-Wardens take Care of them, or el&s;e make
this dull Jade carry 'em back to&mdash;again,
and let her that brought them, into the World,
look after them if &s;he will; what does &s;he &s;end
her Bratts to me for?.</P>
<P>The la&s;t, indeed, had been the be&s;t of the two,
&s;ays the Poor Woman, if it had been to be done,
and that brings me to tell you my Errand, and
the Occa&s;ion of my coming, for I came on pur|po&s;e
about this very Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to have prevent|ed
this being put upon you, if I cou'd; but I &s;ee
I am come too late.</P>
<P>How do you mean too late, &s;ays the Mi&s;tre&s;s?
What, have you been concern'd in this Affair
then? What, have you help'd bring this Family|Slur
upon us? I hope you do not think &s;uch a
thing of me, Madam, &s;ays the poor Woman; but
I went this Morning to&mdash;, to &s;ee my old Mi|&s;tre&s;s
and Benefactor, for &s;he had been very kind to
me, and when I came to the Door, I found all fa&s;t
lock'd mid bolted, and the Hou&s;e looking as if no|body
was at Home.</P>
<P>I knock'd at the Door, but no-body came, till
at la&s;t &s;ome of the Neighbours Servants call'd to
me and &s;aid, There's no-body lives there, Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="22" REF="27">
what do you knock for? I &s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd
at that: What, no-body live there! <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> what
d' ye mean! Does not Mrs.&mdash;live there? The
An&s;wer was, No, &s;he is gone; at which I parly'd
with one of them, and ask'd her what was the
Matter; Matter, &s;ays &s;he, why 'tis Matter enough,
the poor Gentlewoman has liv'd there all alone,
and without any thing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t her, a long time,
and this Morning the Landlord turn'd her out of
Doors.</P>
<P>Out of Doors! <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what with all her Chil|dren,
poor Lambs, what is become of them I Why
truly, nothing wor&s;e, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> can come to them
than &s;taying here, for they were almo&s;t &s;tarv'd
with Hunger; &s;o the Neighbours &s;eeing the poor
Lady in &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s, for &s;he &s;tood crying, and
wringing her Hands over her Children like one
di&s;tracted, &s;ent for the Church-Wardens to take
care of the Children; and they, when they came,
took the Youngeft, which was born in this Pari&s;h,
and have got it a very good Nur&s;e, and taken
Care of it; but as for the other four, they had
&s;ent them away to &s;ome of their Father's Relati|ons,
and who were very &s;ub&s;tantial People, and
who be&s;ides that, liv'd in the Pari&s;h where they
were born.</P>
<P>I was not &s;o &s;urpriz'd at this, as not pre&s;ently
to fore&s;ee that this Trouble would be brought
upon you, or upon Mr.&mdash;; &s;o I came imme|diately
to bring you word of it, tnat you might
be prepar'd for it, and might not be &s;urpriz'd?
but I &s;ee they have been too nimble for me, &s;o that
I know not what to advi&s;e; the poor Woman,
it &s;eems, is turn'd out of Doors into the Street;
and another of the Neighbours there told me,
that when they took her Children from her, &s;he
&s;woon'd away, and when they recovered her out
<PB N="23" REF="28">
of that, &s;he run di&s;tracted, and is put into a Mad|Hou&s;e
by the Pari&s;h: for there is no-body el&s;e to
take any Care of her.</P>
<P>This was all acted to the Life by this good,
kind, poor Creature; for tho' her Dei&s;gn was per|fectly
good and charitable, yet there was not one
Word of it true in Fact; for I was not turn'd out
of Doors by the Landlord, nor gone di&s;tracted;
it was true, indeed, that at parting with my poor
Children, I fainted, and was like one Mad when I
came to my&s;elf and found they were gone; but I
remain'd in the Hou&s;e a good while after that; as
you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>While the poor Woman was telling this di&s;mal
Story, in came the Gentlewoman's Husband, and
tho' her Heart was harden'd again&s;t all Pity, who
was really and nearly related to the Children,
for they were the Children of her own Brother;
yet the good Man was quite &s;often'd with the di&s;|mal
Relation of the Circum&s;tances of the Family;
and when the poor Woman had done, he &s;aid to
his Wife, This is a di&s;mal Ca&s;e, my Dear, in|deed,
and &s;omething mu&s;t be done: His Wife fell
a raving at him, What <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> do you want to
have four Children to keep? Have we not Children
of our own? Would you have the&s;e Bratts come
and eat up my Children's Bread? No, no, let 'em
go to the Pari&s;h, and let them take Care of them,
I'll take Care of my own.</P>
<P>Come, come, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays the Husband</HI> Cha|rity
is a Duty to the Poor, and <HI>he that gives to the
Poor, lends to the Lord;</HI> let us lend our Heavenly
Father a little of our Children's Bread, as you
call it, it will be a Store well laid up for them,
and will be the be&s;t Security that our Children
&s;hall never come to want Charity, or be turn'd
out of Doors, as, the&s;e poor innocent Creatures are.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="29">
Don't tell me of Security, <HI>&s;ays the Wife,;</HI> 'tis a
good Security for our Children, to keep what we
have together, and provide for them, and then 'tis
time enough to help keep other Folks Children;
Charity begins at home.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he again,</HI> I only talk of
putting out a little Money to Intere&s;t, our Maker
is a good Borrower, never fear making a bad Debt
there Child; I'll be Bound for it.</P>
<P>Don't banter me with your Charity, and your
Allegories, <HI>&s;ays the Wife angrily,</HI> I tell you they
are my Relations, not yours, and they &s;hall not
roo&s;t here, they &s;hall go to the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>All your Relations are my Relations now, <HI>&s;ays
the good Gentleman very calmly,</HI> and I won't &s;ee your
Relations in Di&s;tre&s;s and not pity them, any more
than I would my own; indeed, my Dear, they
&s;han't go to the Pari&s;h, I a&s;&s;ure you none of my
Wife's Relations &s;hall come to the Pari&s;h, if I can
help it.</P>
<P>What, will you take four Children to keep?
<HI>&s;ays the Wife.</HI></P>
<P>No, no, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> there's your Si&s;ter&mdash;I'll
go and talk with her, and your Un|cle&mdash;,
I'll &s;end for him and the re&s;t; I'll war|rant
you when we are all together we will find
Ways and Means to keep four poor little Crea|tures
from Beggary and Starving, or el&s;e it will be
very hard; we are none of us in &s;o bad Circum|&s;tances
but we are able to &s;pare a Mite for the Fa|therle&s;s;
don't &s;hut up your Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion
again&s;t your own Fle&s;h and Blood: Could you hear
che&s;e poor innocent Children cry at your poor for
Hunger, and give them no Bread?</P>
<P>Prethc$ what need they cry at our Door? <HI>&s;ays
&s;he,</HI> 'tis the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Pari&s;h to provide for
them, they than a cry at our Door; if they do, I'll
<PB N="25" REF="30">
give them nothing: Won't you, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but I will,
remember that dreadful Scripture is directly again&s;t
us, <HI>Prov. 21. 13. Who&s;e &s;toppeth his Ears at the Cry
of the Poor, he al&s;o &s;hall cry him&s;elf, but &s;hall not be
heard.</HI></P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you mu&s;t do what you will,
becau&s;e you pretend to be Ma&s;ter; but if I had
my Will, I would &s;end them Where they ought
to be &s;ent, I would &s;end them from whence they
came.</P>
<P>Then the poor Woman put in, and &s;aid, But,
Madam, that is &s;ending them to &s;tarve indeed;
for the Pari&s;h has no Obligation to take Care of
'em, and &s;o they would lie and peri&s;h in the Street.</P>
<P>Or be &s;ent back again, <HI>&s;ays the Husband,</HI> to our
Pari&s;h in a Cripple-Cart, by the Ju&s;tice's Warrant,
and &s;o expo&s;e us and all the Relations to the la&s;t
Degree, among our Neighbours, and among tho&s;e
who knew the good Old Gentleman their Grandfa|ther,
who liv'd and flouri&s;h'd in this Pari&s;h &s;o ma|ny
Years, and was &s;o well belov'd among all People,
and de&s;erv'd it &s;o well.</P>
<P>I don't value that one Farthing, not I, <HI>&s;ays the
Wife,</HI> I'll keep none of them.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays her Husband,</HI> but I value it,
for I won't have &s;uch a Blot lie upon the Family,
and upon your Children; he was a worthy, anci|ent,
and good Man, and his Name is re&s;pected a|mong
all his Neighbours; it will be a Reproach to
you, that are his Daughter, and to our Children,
that are his Grand-Children, that we &s;hould let
your Brother's Children peri&s;h, or come to be a
Charge to the Publick, in the very Place where
your Family once flouri&s;h'd: Come, &s;ay no more,
I'll &s;ee what can be done.</P>
<P>Upon this, he &s;ends and gathers all the Relati|ons
together at a Tavern hard-by, and &s;ent for
<PB N="26" REF="31">
the four little Children that they might &s;ee them;

Care of; and becau&s;e his Wife was &s;o furious
that &s;he would not &s;uffer one of them to be kept
at Home, they agreed to keep them all together
for a-while; &s;o they committed them to the poor
Woman that had manag'd the Affair for them, and
enter'd into Obligations to one another to &s;upply
the needful Sums for their Maintenance; and not
to have one &s;eparated from the re&s;t, they &s;ent for
the Younge&s;t from the Pari&s;h where it was taken
in, and had them all brought up together.</P>
<P>It would take up too long a Part of this Story
to give a particular Account with what a charita|ble
Tenderne&s;s this good Per&s;on, who was but
Uncle-in-Law to them, manag'd that Affair; how
careful he was of them; went con&s;tantly to &s;ee
them, and to &s;ee that they were well provided for,
cloath'd, put to School, and at la&s;t put out in the
World tor their Advantage but 'tis enough to &s;ay
he acted more like a Father to them, than an Un|cle-in-Law,
tho' all along much again&s;t his Wife's
Con&s;ent, who was of a Di&s;po&s;ition not &s;o tender
and compa&s;&s;ionate as her Husband.</P>
<P>You may believe I heard this with the &s;ame Plea|&s;ure
which I now feel at the relating it again; for
I was terribly frighted at the Apprehen&s;ions of my
Children being brought to Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s, as
tho&s;e mu&s;t be who have no Friends, but are left
to Pari&s;h Benevolence.</P>
<P>I was now, however, entring on a new Scene
of Life; I had a great Hou&s;e upon my Hands,
and &s;ome Furniture left in it, but I was no more
able to maintain my&s;elf and My Maid <HI>Amy</HI> in it,
than I was my five Children nor had I any thing
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t with, but what I might get by work|ing,
and that was not a Town where much Work
was to be had.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="32">
My Landlord had been very kind indeed, af|ter
he came to know my Circum&s;tances, tho' be|fore
I was acquainted with that Part, he had gone
&s;o far as to &s;eize my Goods, and to carry &s;ome of
them off too.</P>
<P>But I had liv'd three Quarters of a Year in his
Hou&s;e after that, and had paid him no Rent, and
which was wor&s;e, I was in no Condition to pay
him any; however, I ob&s;erv'd he came oftner to
&s;ee me, look'd kinder upon me, and &s;poke more
friendly to me, than he us'd to do; particularly the
la&s;t two or three times he had been there, he ob|&s;erv'd,
<HI>he &s;aid,</HI> how poorly I liv'd, how low I was re|duc'd,
and the like, told me it griev'd him for my
&s;ake; and the la&s;t time of all he was kinder &s;till, told
me he came to Dine with me, and that I &s;hould give
him leave to Treat me; &s;o he call'd my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI>
and &s;ent her out to buy a Joint of Meat; he told
her what &s;he &s;hould buy, but naming two or three
things, either of which &s;he might take the Maid,
a cunning Wench, and faithful to me, as the Skin
to my Back, did not buy any thing out-right, but
brought the Butcher along with her, with both
the things that &s;he had cho&s;en, for him to plea&s;e
him&s;elf; the one was a large very good Leg of
Veal; the other a Piece of the Fore-Ribs of
Roa&s;ting Beef; he look'd at them, but bade me
chaffer with the Butcher for him, and I did &s;o, and
came back to him, and told him what the Butcher
demanded for either of them, and what each, of
them came to; &s;o he pulls out 11. <HI>s.</HI> and 3 <HI>d.</HI> which
they came to together, and bade me take them
both, the re&s;t, he &s;aid, would &s;erve another time.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpriz'd, you may be &s;ure, at the Bounty
of a Man that had but a little while ago been my
Terror and had torn the Goods out of my Hou&s;e,
like a Fury, but I con&s;ider'd that my Di&s;tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="28" REF="33">
had mollified his Temper, and that he had after|wards
been &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate as to give me Leave
to live Rent-free in the Hou&s;e a whole Year.</P>
<P>But now he put on the Face, not of a Man of
Compa&s;&s;ion only, but of a Man of Friend&s;hip and
Kindne&s;s, and this was &s;o unexpected, that it was
&s;urprizing: We chatted together, and were, as I
may call it, Chearful, which was more than I could
&s;ay I had been for three Years before; he &s;ent for
Wine and Beer too, for I had none poor <HI>Amy</HI> and
I had drank nothing but Water for many Weeks,
and indeed, I have often wonder'd at the faithful
Temper of the poor Girl; for which I but ill re|quited
her at la&s;t.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> was come with the Wine, he made
her fill a Gla&s;s to him, and with the Gla&s;s in his
Hand, he came to me, and ki&s;s'd me, which I
was, I confe&s;s, a little &s;urpriz'd at, but more at
what follow'd; for he told me, That as the &s;ad
Condition which I was reduc'd to, had made
him pity me, &s;o my Conduct in it, and the Cou|rage
I bore it with, had given him a more than or|dinary
Re&s;pect for me, and made him very
thoughtful for my Good; that he was re&s;olv'd for
the pre&s;ent to do &s;omething to relieve me, and to
employ his Thoughts in the mean time, to &s;ee if
he could, for the future, put me into a Way to
&s;upport my&s;elf.</P>
<P>While he found me change Colour, and look &s;ur|priz'd
at his Di&s;cour&s;e, for &s;o did to be &s;ure, he
turns to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and looking at her, he
&s;ays co me, I &s;ay all this Madam, before your Maid,
becau&s;e both &s;he and you &s;hall know that I have no
ill De&s;ign, and that I have, in meer Kindne&s;s, re|&s;olv'd
to do &s;omething for you, if I can; and as I
have been a Witne&s;s of the uncommon Hone&s;ty
and Fidelity of Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> here, &s;o you in all your
<PB N="29" REF="34">
Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I know &s;he may be tru&s;ted with &s;o ho|ne&s;t
a De&s;ign as mine is; for, I a&s;&s;ure you, I bear
a proportion'd Regard to your Maid too, for her
Affection to you.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> made him a Curt&s;ie, and the poor Girl
look'd &s;o confounded with Joy, that &s;he could not
&s;peak, but her Colour came and went, and every
now and then &s;he blu&s;h'd as red as Scarlet, and
the next Minute look'd as pale as Death: Well,
having &s;aid this, he &s;at down, made me &s;it down,
and then drank to me, and made me drink two
Gla&s;&s;es of Wine together; for, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you have
Need of it, and &s;o indeed I had: When he had
done &s;o, Come <HI>Amy, &s;ays he,</HI> with your Mi&s;tre&s;s's
Leave, you &s;hall have a Gla&s;s too, &s;o he made her
drink two Gla&s;&s;es al&s;o, and then ri&s;ing up; and
now <HI>Amy, &s;ays he,</HI> go and get Dinner; and you,
Madam, &s;ays he to me, go up and dre&s;s you, and
come down and &s;mile and be merry; adding, I'll
make you ea&s;ie, if I can; and in the mean time,
he &s;aid, he would walk in the Garden.</P>
<P>When he was gone, <HI>Amy</HI> chang'd her Counte|nance
indeed, and look'd as merry as ever &s;he did
in her Life; Dear Madam! <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> what does this
Gentleman mean? Nay, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> he means to
do us Good, you &s;ee, don't he? I know no other
Meaning he can have, for he can get nothing by me:
I warrant you, Madam, <HI>&s;ays,</HI> he'll ask you a Fa|vour
by and by: No, no, you are mi&s;taken, <HI>Amy,</HI>
I dare &s;ay, <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> you heard what he &s;aid, didn't
you? Ay, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> it's no matter for that, you
&s;hall &s;ee what he will do after Dinner: Well, well,
<HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> you have hard Thoughts of him, I
cannot be of your Opinion I don't &s;ee any thing
in him yet that looks like it: As to that, Madam,
&s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I don't &s;ee any thing of it yet neither;
but what &s;hould move a Gentleman to take Pity of
<PB N="30" REF="35">
us, as he does? Nay, <HI>Says I,</HI> that's a hard thing too,
that we &s;hould judge a Man to be wicked becau&s;e
he's charitable; and vicious becau&s;e he's kind: O
Madam, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> there's abundance of Charity
begins in that Vice, and he is not &s;o unacquainted
with things, as not to know, that Poverty is the
&s;tronge&s;t Incentive; a Temptation, again&s;t which
no Virtue is powerful enough to &s;tand out; he
knows your Condition as well as you do: Well,
and what then? Why then he knows too that you
are young and hand&s;ome, and he has the &s;ure&s;t
Bait in the World to take you with.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> but he may find him&s;elf mi|&s;taken
too in &s;uch a thing as that: Why, Ma|dam,
&s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I hope you won't deny him, if he
&s;hould offer it.</P>
<P>What d'ye mean by that, <HI>Hu&s;&s;y, &s;aid I?</HI> No, I'd
&s;tarve fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I hope not, Madam, I hope you would be wi&s;er;
I'm &s;ure if he will &s;et you up, as he talks of, you
ought to deny him nothing; and you will &s;tarve
if you do not con&s;ent, that's certain.</P>
<P>What, con&s;ent to lye with him for Bread?
<HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> How can you talk &s;o?</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> don't think you wou'd
for any thing el&s;e; it would not be Lawful for
any thing el&s;e, but for Bread, Madam; why no|body
can &s;tarve, there's no bearing that, I'm &s;ure.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> but if he would give me an E&s;tate

<P>Why look you, Madam, if he would but give
you enough to live ea&s;ie upon, he &s;hould lye with
me for it with all my Heart.</P>
<P>That's a Token, <HI>Amy</HI> of inimitable Kindne&s;s

But however, <HI>Amy,</HI> you &s;hall not be a Whore to

me much more than he is able to give me, or do
for me.</P>
<P>Why Madam, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I don't &s;ay I will go
and ask him; but I &s;ay, if he &s;hould promi&s;e

&s;uch, that he would not &s;erve you unle&s;s I would
let him lye with me, he &s;hould lye with me as of|ten
as he would, rather than you &s;hould not have
his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but this is but Talk, Madam, I
don't &s;ee any need of &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e, and you are
of Opinion that there will be no need of it.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;o I am, <HI>Amy;</HI> but, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if there was,

<P>Hitherto I had not only pre&s;erv'd the Virtue it|&s;elf,

tho' I had peri&s;h'd of meer Hunger; for, without
que&s;tion, a Woman ought rather to die, than to
pro&s;titute her Virtue and Honour, let the Tempta|tion
be what it will.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="37">
But to return to my Story; he walk'd about the
Garden; which was, indeed, all in Di&s;order, and
over-run with Weeds, becau&s;e I had not been able
to hire a Gardener to do any thing to it, no not &s;o
much as to dig up Ground enough to &s;ow a few
Turnips and Carrots for Family-U&s;e: After he
had view'd it, he came in, and &s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> to fetch
a poor Man, a Gardener, that us'd to help our
Man-Servant, and carry'd him into the Garden,
and order'd him to do &s;everal things in it, to put
it into a little Order; and this took him up near
an Hour.</P>
<P>By this time I had dre&s;s'd me, as well as I could,
for tho' I had good Linnen left &s;till, yet I had but
a poor Head-Dre&s;s, and no Knots, but old Frag|ments;
no Necklace, no Ear-Rings; all tho&s;e things
were gone long ago for meer Bread.</P>
<P>However, I was tight and clean, and in better
Plight than he had &s;een me in a great while, and
he look'd extreamly pleas'd to &s;ee me &s;o; for he &s;aid
I look'd &s;o di&s;con&s;olate, and &s;o afflicted before, that
it griev'd him to &s;ee me; and he bade me pluck up
a good Heart, for he hop'd to put me in a Condi|tion
to live in the World, and be beholden to no|body.</P>
<P>I told him that was impo&s;&s;ible, for I mu&s;t be
beholden to him for it, for all the Friends I had
in the World wou'd not, or cou'd not, do &s;o much
for me as that he &s;poke of. Well, <HI>Widom, &s;ays he,</HI>
&s;o he call'd me, and &s;o indeed I was in the wor&s;t
Sence that de&s;olate Word cou'd be us'd in, if you
are beholden to me, you &s;hall be beholden to no|body
el&s;e.</P>
<P>By this time Dinner was ready, and <HI>Amy</HI> came
in to lay the Cloth, and indeed, it was happy
there was none to Dine but he and I, for I had
but &s;ix Places left in the Hou&s;e, and but two
<PB N="33" REF="38">
Di&s;hes; however, he knew now things were, and
bade me make no Scruple about bringing out what
I had, he hop'd to &s;ee me in a better Plight, he
did nor come, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> to be Entertain'd, but to En|tertain
me, and Comfort and Encourage me: Thus
he went on, &s;peaking &s;o chearfully to me, and &s;uch
cheerful things, that it was a Cordial to my very
Soul, to hear him &s;peak.</P>
<P>Well, we went to Dinner, I'm &s;ure I had not eat a
good Meal hardly in a Twelvemonth, at lea&s;t, not
of &s;uch a Joint of Meat as the Loin of Veal was;
I eat indeed very heartily, and &s;o did he, and he
made me drink three or four Gla&s;&s;es of Wine, &s;o
that, in &s;hort, my Spitits were lifted up to a De|gree
I had not been us'd to, and I was not only
chearful, but merry, and &s;o he pre&s;s'd me to be.</P>
<P>I told him, I had a great deal of Rea&s;on to be
merry, &s;eeing he had been &s;o kind to me, and had
given me Hopes of recovering me from the wor&s;t
Circum&s;tances that ever Woman of any &s;ort of
Fortune, was &s;unk into; that he cou'd not but
believe that what he had &s;aid to me, was like Life
from the Dead; that it was like recovering one
Sick from the Brink of the Grave; how I &s;hould
ever make him a Return any way &s;uitable, was
what I had not yet had time to think of; I cou'd
only &s;ay, that I &s;hould never forget it while I had
Life, and &s;hou'd be always ready to acknowlege it.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, That was all he de&s;ir'd of me, that
his Reward would be, the Satisfaction of having
re&s;cued me from Mi&s;ery; that he found he was
obliging one that knew what Gratitude meant; that
he would make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to make me com|pleatly
Ea&s;ie, fir&s;t or la&s;t, if it lay in his Power;
and in the mean time, he bade me con&s;ider
of any thing that I thought he might do for me,
for my Advantage, and in order to make me perfect|ly
ea&s;ie.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="39">
After we had talk'd thus, he bade me be chearful;
come, &s;ays he, lay a&s;ide the&s;e melancholly things,
and let us be merry: <HI>Amy</HI> waited at the Table,
and &s;he &s;mil'd, and laugh'd, and was &s;o merry &s;he
could hardly contain it, for the Girl lov'd me to
an Exce&s;s, hardly to be de&s;crib'd; and it was &s;uch
an unexpected thing to hear any one talk to her
Mi&s;tre&s;s, that the Wench was be&s;ides, her&s;elf al|mo&s;t,
and as &s;oon as Dinner was over, <HI>Amy</HI> went
up-Stairs, and put on her Be&s;t Clothes too, and
came down dre&s;$'d like a Gentlewoman.</P>
<P>We &s;at together talking of a thou&s;and Things,
of what had been, and what was to be, all the
re&s;t of the Day, and in the Evening he took his
Leave of me, with a thou&s;and Expre&s;&s;ions of
Kindne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s, and true Affection to
me, but offer'd not the lea&s;t of what my Maid
<HI>Amy</HI> had &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>At his poing away, he took me in his Arms,
prote&s;ted an hone&s;t Kindne&s;s to me; &s;aid a thou|&s;and
kind things to me, which I cannot now recol|lect,
and after ki&s;&s;ing me twenty times, or there|abouts,
put a Guinea into my Hand; which, he
&s;aid, was for my pre&s;ent Supply, and told me,
that he would &s;ee me again, before 'twas out; al&s;o
he gave <HI>Amy</HI> Half a Crown.</P>
<P>When he was gone, Well, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> are you
convinc'd now that he is an hone&s;t as well as a
true Friend, and that there has been nothing, not
the lea&s;t Appearance of any thing of what you
imagin'd, in his Behaviour: Yes, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I am,
but I admire at it; he is &s;uch a Friend as the
World, &s;ure, has not abundance of to &s;how.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> he is &s;uch a Friend as I have
long wanted and as I have as much Need of as any
Creature in the World has, or ever had; and, in
&s;hort, I was &s;o overcome with the Comfort of it,
<PB N="35" REF="40">
that I &s;at down and cry'd for Joy a good-while,
as I had formerly cry'd for Sorrow. <HI>Amy</HI> and I
went to Bed that Night (for <HI>Amy</HI> lay with me)
pretty early, but lay chatting almo&s;t all Night a|bout
it, and the Girl was &s;o tran&s;ported, that &s;he
got up two or three times in the Night, and danc'd
about the Room in her Shift; in &s;hort, the Girl
was half di&s;tracted with the Joy of it; a Te&s;timo|ny
&s;till of her violent Affection for her Mi&s;tre&s;s, in
which no Servant ever went beyond her.</P>
<P>We heard no more of him for two Days, but
the third Day he came again; then he told me,
with the &s;ame Kindne&s;s, that he had order'd me a
Supply of Hou&s;hold-Goods for the furni&s;hing the
Hou&s;e; that in particular, he had &s;ent me back
all the Goods that he had &s;eiz'd for Rent, which
con&s;i&s;ted, indeed, of the be&s;t of my former Fur|niture;
and now, &s;ays he, I'll tell you what I
have had in my Head for you, for your pre&s;ent
Supply, and that is, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that the Hou&s;e being
well furni&s;h'd, you &s;hall Let it out to Lodgings,
for the Summer Gentry, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> by which you
will ea&s;ily get a good comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tance, e&s;|pecially
&s;eeing you &s;hall pay me no Rent for two
Years, nor after neither, unle&s;s you can afford it.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t View I had of living comfort|ably
indeed, and it was a very probable Way, I
mu&s;t confe&s;s; &s;eeing we had very good Conveni|ences,
&s;ix Rooms on a Floor, and three Stories
high: While he was laying down the Scheme of
my Management, came a Cart to the Door with a
Load of Goods, and an Uphol&s;terer's Man to put
them up; they were chiefly the Furniture of two
Rooms, which he had carried away for his two
Years Rent, with two fine Cabinets, and &s;ome Peir-Gla&s;&s;es,
out of the Parlour, and &s;everal other valu|able
things.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="41">
The&s;e were all re&s;tor'd to their Places, and he
told me he gave them me freely, as a Satisfaction
for the Cruelty he had us'd me with before; and
the Furniture of one Room being fini&s;h'd, and &s;et
up, he told me, he would furni&s;h one Chamber
for him&s;elf, and would come and be one of my
Lodgers, if I would give him Leave.</P>
<P>I told him, he ought not to ask me Leave, who
had &s;o much Right to make him&s;elf welcome; &s;o
the Hou&s;e began to look in &s;ome tollerable Fi|gure,
and clean; the Garden al&s;o, in about a Fort|night's
Work, began to look &s;omething le&s;s like a
Wilderne&s;s than it us'd to do; and he order'd me
to put up a Bill for Letting Rooms, re&s;erving one
for him&s;elf, to come to as he &s;aw Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>When all was done to his Mind, as to placing
the Goods, he &s;eem'd very well pleas'd, and we
din'd together again of his own providing, and
the Uphol&s;terer's Man gone; after Dinner he took
me by the Hand, Come, now Madam, &s;ays he,
you mu&s;t &s;how me your Hou&s;e, (for he had a-Mind
to &s;ee every thing over again) No, Sir, &s;aid
I, but I'll go &s;how you your Hou&s;e, if you plea&s;e; &s;o
we went up thro' all the Rooms, and in the Room
which was appointed for him&s;elf, <HI>Amy</HI> was doing
&s;omething; Well, <HI>Amyf</HI> &s;ays he, I intend to Lye
with you to Morrow-Night; <HI>To Night, if you
plea&s;e Sir,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Amy</HI> very innocently, <HI>your Room is
quite ready:</HI> Well <HI>Amy, &s;ays he,</HI> I am glad you are
&s;o willing: No, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I mean your Chamber
is ready to-Night, and away &s;he run out of the
Room a&s;ham$d enough; for the Girl meant no
Harm, whatever &s;he had &s;aid to me in private.</P>
<P>However, he &s;aid no more then; but when <HI>Amy</HI>
was gone, he walk'd about the Room, and look'd
at evert thing, and taking me by the Hand, he
ki&s;s'd me, and &s;poke a great many kind, affectionate
<PB N="37" REF="42">
things to me indeed; as of his Mea&s;ures for my Ad|vantage,
and what he wou'd do to rai&s;e me again
in the World; told me, that my Afflictions, and
the Conduct I had &s;hown in bearing them to &s;uch
an Extremity, had &s;o engag'd him to me, that
he valued me infinitely above all the Women in the
World; that tho' he was under &s;uch Engagements
that he cou'd not Marry me, [his Wife and he
had been parted, for &s;ome Rea&s;ons, which make
too long a Story to intermix with mine] yet that
he wou'd be every thing el&s;e that a Woman cou'd
ask in a Husband, and with that he ki&s;s'd me a|gain,
and took me in his Arms, but offer'd not the
lea&s;t uncivil Action to me, and told me, he hop'd I
would not deny him all the Favours he &s;hould ask,
becau&s;e he re&s;olv'd to ask nothing of me but what it
was fit for a Woman of Virtue and Mode&s;ty, for
&s;uch he knew me to be, to yield.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the terrible Pre&s;&s;ure of my former Mi|&s;ery,
the Memory of which lay heavy upon my
Mind, and the &s;urprizing Kindne&s;s with which
he had deliver'd me, and withal, the Expecta|tions
of what he might &s;till do for me, were pow|erful
things, and made me have &s;carce the Power
to deny him any thing he wou'd ask; however, I
told him thus, with an Air of Tenderne&s;s too,
that he had done &s;o much for me, that I thought
I ought to deny him nothing, only I hop'd, and
depended upon him, that he wou'd not take the
Advantage of the infinite Obligations I was under
to him, to de&s;ire any thing of me, the yielding
to which would lay me lower in his E&s;teem than
I de&s;ir'd to be; that as I took him to be a Man of
Honour, &s;o I kn$w he could not like me the better
for doing any thing that was below a Woman of
Hone&s;ty and Good Manners to do.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="43">
He told me, that he had done all this for me,
without &s;o much as telling me what Kindne&s;s or
real Affection he had for me, that I might not be
under any Nece&s;&s;ity of yielding to him in any
thing, for want of Bread; and he would no more
oppre&s;s my Gratitude now, than he would my
Nece&s;&s;ity before, nor ask any thing, &s;uppo&s;ing he
would &s;top his Favours, or withdraw his Kind|ne&s;s,
if he was deny'd; it was true, he &s;aid, he
might tell me more freely his Mind now, than
before, &s;eeing I had let him &s;ee that I accepted his
A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;aw that he was &s;incere in his
De&s;ign of &s;erving me; that he had gone thus far
to &s;hew me that he was kind to me, but that now
he would tell me, that he lov'd me, and yet
wou'd demon&s;trate that his Love was both ho|nourable,
and that what he &s;hou'd de&s;ire, was what
he might hone&s;tly ask, and I might hone&s;tly grant.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd, That within tho&s;e two Limitations,
I was &s;ure I ought to deny him nothing, and I
&s;hould think my&s;elf not ungrateful only, but very
unju&s;t, if I &s;hou'd; &s;o he &s;aid no more, but I ob|&s;erv'd
he ki&s;s'd me more, and took me in his
Arms in a kind of familiar Way, more than u&s;ual,
and which once or twice put me in Mind of my
Maid <HI>Amy</HI>'s Words; and yet, I mu&s;t acknowlege,
I was &s;o overcome with his Goodne&s;s to me in
tho&s;e many kind things he had done, that I not only
was ea&s;ie at what he did, and made no Re&s;i&s;t|ance,
but was inclin'd to do the like, whatever he
had offer'd to do: But he went no farther than
what I have &s;aid, nor did he offer &s;o much as to
&s;it down on the Bed-&s;ide with me, but took his
Leave, &s;aid he lov'd me tenderly, and would con|vince
me of it by &s;uch Demon&s;trations as &s;hould
be to my Satisfaction: I told him, I had a great
deal of Rea&s;on to believe him; that he was full
<PB N="39" REF="44">
Ma&s;ter of the whole Hou&s;e, and of me, as far as
was within the Bounds we had &s;poken of, which I
believ'd he would not break; and as'd him if he
wou'd not Lodge there that Night.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he cou'd not well &s;tay thbt Night, Bu|&s;ine&s;s
requiring him in <HI>London,</HI> but added, &s;miling,
that he wou'd come the next Day, and take a
Night's Lodging with me. I pre&s;s'd him to &s;tay
that Night, and told him, I &s;hould be glad a
Friend &s;o valuable &s;hould he under the &s;ame Roof
with me; and indeed, I began at that time not
only to be much oblig'd to him, but to love him
too, and that in a Manner that I had not been ac|quainted
with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>O let no Woman &s;light the Temptation that
being generou&s;ly deliver'd from Trouble, is to any
Spirit furni&s;h'd with Gratitude and ju&s;t Principles:
This Gentleman had freely and voluntarily deli|ver'd
me from Mi&s;ery, from Poverty, and Rags;
he had made me what I was, and put me into a
Way to be even more than I ever was, namely, to
live happy and pleas'd, and on his Bounty I de|pended:
What could I &s;ay to this Gentleman
when he pre&s;s'd me to yield to him, and argued
the Lawfullne&s;s of it? But of that in its Place.</P>
<P>I pre&s;s'd him again to &s;tay that Night, and told
him it was the fir&s;t compleatly happy Night that
I had ever had in the Hou&s;e in my Life, and I
&s;hould be very &s;orry to have it be without his
Company, who was the Cau&s;e and Foundation of
it all; that we would be innocently merry, but
that it could never be without him; and, in &s;hort,
I courted him &s;o, that he &s;aid, he cou'd not deny
me, but he wou'd take his Hor&s;e, and go to <HI>London,</HI>
do the Bu&s;ine&s;s he had to do, which, it &s;eems, was
to pay a Foreign Bill that was due that Night, and
wou'd el&s;e be prote&s;ted; and that he wou'd come
<PB N="40" REF="45">
back in three Hours at farthe&s;t, and Sup with
me, but bade me get nothing there, for &s;ince I was
re&s;olv'd to be merry, which was what he de&s;ir'd
above all things, he wou'd &s;end me &s;omething
from <HI>London,</HI> and we will make it a Wedding Sup|per,
my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and with that Word, took
me in his Arms, and ki&s;s'd me &s;o vehemently,
that I made no que&s;tion but he intended to do
every thing el&s;e that <HI>Amy</HI> had talk'd of.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted a little at the Word <HI>Wedding:</HI> What
do ye mean? to call it by &s;uch a Name, <HI>&s;ays I;</HI>
adding, We will have a Supper, but t'other is im|po&s;&s;ible,
as well on your &s;ide as mine; he laugh'd,
Well, &s;ays he, you &s;hall call it what you will, but
it may be the &s;ame thing, for I &s;hall &s;atisfie you, it
is not &s;o impo&s;&s;ible as you make it.</P>
<P>I don't under&s;tand you, &s;aid I, have not I a Hu&s;|band,
and you a Wife?</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;ays he, we will talk of that after
Supper; &s;o he ro&s;e up, gave me another Ki&s;s, and
took his Hor&s;e for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This kind of Di&s;cour&s;e had fir'd my Blood, I
confe&s;s, and I knew not what to think of it; it
was plain now that he intended to lye with me,
but how he would reconcile it to a legal thing, like
a Marriage, that I cou'd not imagine: We had
both of us us'd <HI>Amy</HI> with &s;o much Intimacy, and
tru&s;ted her with every thing, having &s;uch unexam|pled
In&s;tances of her Fidelity, that he made no
Scruple to ki&s;s me, and &s;ay all the&s;e things to me
before her, nor had he car'd one Farthing if I
would have let him Lay with me, to have had <HI>Amy</HI>
there too all Night. When he was gone, Well,
<HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays I, what will all this come to now? I
am all in a Sweat at him: Come to, Madam, &s;ays
<HI>Amy,</HI> I &s;ee what it will come to, I mu&s;t put you

&s;o impudent, you Jade you, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> wou'd you?
Yes, I wou'd, &s;ays &s;he, with all my Heart, and
think you both as hone&s;t as ever you were in your
Lives.</P>
<P>What ails the Slut to talk &s;o? <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> Hone&s;t! how
can it be hone&s;t? Why, I'll tell you, Madam, &s;ays
<HI>Amy,</HI> I &s;ounded it as &s;oon as I heard him &s;peak,
and it is very true too; he calls you Widow, and
&s;nch, indeed, you are; for as my Ma&s;ter has left
you &s;o many Years, he is dead to be &s;ure: at lea&s;t,
he is dead to you; he is no Husband, you are, and
ought to be free to marry who you will; and his
Wife being gone from him, and refu&s;es to lye with
him, then he is a &s;ingle Man again, as much as
ever; and tho' you cannot bring the Laws of the
Land to join you together, yet one refu&s;ing to do
the Office of a Wife, and the other of a Husband,
you may certainly take one another fairly.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> If I cou'd take him fairly,
you may be &s;ure I'd take him above all the Men in
the World; it turn'd the very Heart within me,
when I heard him &s;ay he lov'd me; how cou'd it
do otherwi&s;e? when you know what a Condition I
was in before; de&s;pis'd, and trampled on by all
the World; I cou'd have took him in my Arms,
and ki&s;s'd him as freely as he did me, if it had
not boon for Shame,</P>
<P>Ay, and all the re&s;t too, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> at the fir&s;t
Word; I don't &s;ee how you can think of denying
him any thing; has he not brought you out of the
Devil's Clu$ches; brought you out of the black|e&s;t
Mi&s;ery that ever poor Lady was reduc'd to?
Can a Woman deny &s;uch a Man any thing?</P>
<P>Nay, I don't know what to do, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays I; I

in foul Linnen the Wedding-Night.</P>
<P>But that I know you to be a very hone&s;t Girl,

<P>It's no matter for that, Madam, I &s;ay nothing
but what I think; you own yew love this Gentle|man,
and he has given you &s;ufficient Te&s;timony of
his Affection to you; your Conditions are alike
unhappy, and he is of Opinion that he may take
another Woman, his fir&s;t Wife having broke her
Honour, and living from him, and that, tho' the
Laws of the Land will not allow him to marry for|mally,
yet, that he may take another Woman into
his Arms, provided he keeps true to the other
Woman as a Wife; nay he &s;ays it is u&s;ual to do &s;o,
and allow'd by the Cu&s;tom of the Place, in &s;everal
Countries abroad; and, I mu&s;t own, I'm of the

&s;he has jilted and abandon'd her Husband, to
confine him from the Plea&s;are as well as Conveni|ence
of a Woman all Days of his Life, which
wou'd be very unrea&s;onable; and as times go, not
tollerable to all People; and the like on your &s;ide,
Madam.</P>
<P>Had I now had my Sences about me, and had
my Rea&s;on not been overcome by the powerful
Attraction of &s;o kind, &s;o beneficent a Friend; had
I con&s;ulted Con&s;cience and Virtue, I &s;hou'd have
repell'd this <HI>Amy,</HI> however faithful and hone&s;t to
me in other things, as a Viper, and Engine of the
Devil; I ought to have remembred that neither
he or I, either by the Laws of God or Man,
<PB N="43" REF="48">
cou'd come together, upon any other Terms than
that of notorious Adultery: The ignorant Jade's
Argument, That he had brought me out of the
Hands of the Devil, by which &s;he meant the
Devil of Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hou'd have been a
powerful Motive to me, not to plunge my&s;elf into
the Jaws of Hell, and into the Power of the real
Devil, in Recompence for that Deliverance; I
&s;hou'd have look'd upon all the Good this Man
had done for me, to have been the particular
Work of the Goodne&s;s of Heaven; and that Good|ne&s;s
&s;hou'd have mov'd me to a Return of Duty
and humble Obedience; I &s;hou'd have received
the Mercy thankfully, and apply'd it &s;oberly, to
the Prai&s;e and Honour of my Maker; whereas by
this wicked Cour&s;e, all the Bounty and Kindne&s;s
of this Gentleman, became a Snare to me, was a
meer Bait to the Devil's Hook; I receiv'd his
Kindne&s;s at the dear Expence of Body and
Soul, mortgaging Faith, Religion, Con&s;cience, and
Mode&s;ty, for (as I may call it) a Mor&s;el of Bread;
or, if you will, ruin'd my Soul from a Principle
of Gratitude, and gave my&s;elf up to the Devil,
to &s;hew my&s;elf grateful to my Benefactor: I
mu&s;t do the Gentleman that Ju&s;tice, as to &s;ay,
I verily believe that he did nothing but what
he thought was Lawful; and I mu&s;t do that
Ju&s;tice upon my&s;elf, as to &s;ay, I did what my
own Con&s;cience convinc'd me at the very Time I
did it, was horribly unlawful, &s;candalous, and
abominable.</P>
<P>But Poverty was my Snare; dreadful Poverty!
the Mi&s;ery I had been in, was great, &s;uch as wou'd
make the Heart tremble at the Apprehen&s;ions of
its Return; and I might appeal to any that has had
any Experience of the World, whether one &s;o
entirely de&s;titute as I was, of all manner of all
<PB N="44" REF="49">
Helps, or Friends, either to &s;upport me, or to a&s;|&s;i&s;t
me to &s;upport my&s;elf, could with&s;tand the Pro|po&s;al;
not that I plead this as a Ju&s;tification of
my Conduct, but that it may move the Pity, even
of tho&s;e that abhor the Crime.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, I was young, hand&s;ome, and with
all the Mortifications I had met with, was vain,
and that not a little; and as it was a new thing,
&s;o it was a plea&s;ant thing, to be courted, care&s;s'd,
embrac'd, and high Profe&s;&s;ions of Affection made
to me by a Man &s;o agreeable, and &s;o able to
do me good.</P>
<P>Add to this, that if I had ventur'd to di&s;oblige
this Gentleman, I had no Friend in the World to
have Reconr&s;e to; I had no Pro&s;pect, no, not of a
Bit of Bread; I had nothing before me, but to
fall back into the &s;ame Mi&s;ery that I had been in
before.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> had but too much Rhetorick in this Cau&s;e;
&s;he repre&s;ented all tho&s;e Things in their proper
Colours; &s;he argued them all with her utmo&s;t
Skill, and at la&s;t, the Merry Jade, when &s;he came
to Dre&s;s me, Look ye, Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> if you
won't con&s;ent, tell him you'll do as <HI>Rachael</HI> did to
<HI>Jacob,</HI> when &s;he could have no Children, pnt her
Maid to Bed to him; tell him you cannot comply
with him, but there's <HI>Amy,</HI> he may ask her the
Que&s;tion, &s;he has promis'd me &s;he won't deny
y$u.</P>
<P>And wou'd you have me &s;ay &s;o, <HI>Amy? &s;aid I.</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam, but I wou'd really have you do &s;o,
be&s;ides you are undone if you do not; and if my
doing it wou'd &s;ave you from being undone, as I
&s;aid before, he &s;hall if he will; if he asks me, I
won't deny him, not I; Hang me if I do, <HI>&s;ays
Amy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="50">
Well, I know not what to do, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> to
<HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P>Do! <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> Your Choice is fair and plain;
here you may have a hand&s;ome, charming Gentle|man,
be rich, live plea&s;antly, and in Plenty; or
refu&s;e him, and want a Dinner, go in Rags, live
in Tears; in &s;hort, beg and &s;tarve; you know
this is the Ca&s;e, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> I wonder how
you can &s;ay you know not what to do.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> the Ca&s;e is as you &s;ay, and
I think verily I mu&s;t yield to him; but then, <HI>&s;aid I,
mov'd by Con&s;cience,</HI> don't talk any more of your
Cant, of its being Lawful that I ought to Marry
again, and that he ought to Marry again, and
&s;uch Stuff as that; 'tis all Non&s;ence, <HI>&s;ays I, Amy,</HI>
there's nothing in it, let me hear no more of that;
for if I yield, 'tis in vain to mince the Matter, I
am a Whore, <HI>Amy,</HI> neither better nor wor&s;e, I
a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>I don't think &s;o, Madam, by no means, <HI>&s;ays
Amy,</HI> I wonder how you can talk &s;o; and then
&s;he run on with her Argument of the Unrea&s;ona|blene&s;s
that a Woman &s;hould be oblig'd to live
&s;ingle, or a Man to live &s;ingle in &s;uch Ca&s;es, as be|fore:
Well, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> come let us di&s;pute no
more; for the longer I enter into that Part, the
greater my Scruples will be; but if I let it alone,
the Nece&s;&s;ity of my pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances is &s;uch,
that I believe I &s;hall yield to him, if he &s;hould im|portune
me much about it, but I &s;hould be glad
he would not do it all, but leave me as I am.</P>
<P>As to that, Madam, you may depend, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI>
he expects to have you for his Bedfellow to
Night; I &s;aw it plainly in his Management all Day,
and at la&s;t he told you &s;o too, us plain, I think, as he
cou'd: Well, well, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I,</HI> I don't know what to
&s;ay, if he will, he mu&s;t, I think, I don't know
<PB N="46" REF="51">
how to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a Man, that has done &s;o much
for me: I don't know how you &s;hou'd, <HI>&s;ays Amy.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Amy</HI> and I canva&s;s'd the Bu&s;ine&s;s between
us; the Jade prompted the Crime, which I had
but too much Inclination to commit; that is to
&s;ay, not as a Crime, for I had nothing of the
Vice in my Con&s;titution; my Spirits were far
from being high; my Blood had no Fire in it, to
kindle the Flame of De&s;ire; but the Kindne&s;s and
good Humour of the Man, and the Dread of my
own Circum&s;tances concurr'd to bring me to the
Point, and I even re&s;olv'd, before he ask'd, to give
up my Virtue to him, whenever he &s;hould put it to
the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In this I was a double Offender, whatever he
was; for I was re&s;olv'd to commit the Crime,
knowing and owning it to be a Crime; he, if it
was true as he &s;aid, was fully per&s;waded it was
Lawful, and in that Per&s;wa&s;ion he took the Mea|&s;ures,
and us'd all the Circumlocutions which I
am going to &s;peak of.</P>
<P>ABOUT two Hours after he was gone, came a
<HI>Leaden-Hall</HI> Basket-Woman, with a whole Load
of good Things for the Mouth; the Particulars
are not to the Purpo&s;e, and brought Orders to get
Supper by Eight a-Clock; however, I did not intend
to begin to dre&s;s any thing, till I &s;aw him; and he
gave me time enough, for he came before Seven;
&s;o that <HI>Amy,</HI> who had gotten one to help her, got
every thing ready in Time.</P>
<P>We &s;at down to Supper about Eight, and were
indeed, very merry; <HI>Amy</HI> made us &s;ome Sport,
for &s;he was a Girl of Spirit and Wit; and with
her Talk &s;he made us laugh very often, and yet
the Jade manag'd her Wit with all the good Man|ners
imaginable.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="52">
But to &s;horten the Story; after Supper, he took
me up into his Chamber, where <HI>Amy</HI> had made a
good Fire, and there he pull'd out a great many
Papers, and &s;pread them upon a little Table, and
then took me by the Hand, and after ki&s;&s;ing me
very much, he enter'd into a Di&s;cour&s;e of his
Circum&s;tances, and of mine, how they agreed in
&s;everal things exactly; for Example, That I was
abandon'd of a Husband in the Prime of my
Youth and Vigour, and he of a Wife in his Mid|dle-Age;
how the End of Marriage was de&s;troy'd
by the Treatment we had either of us receiv'd;
and it wou'd be very hard that we &s;hould be ty'd
by the Formality of the Contract, where the E&s;|&s;ence of
it was de&s;troy'd: I interrupted him, and
told him, There was a va&s;t Difference between our
Circum&s;tances, and that in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Part;
namely, That he was Rich, and I was Poor; that
he was above the World, and I infinitely below it;
that his Circum&s;tances were very ea&s;ie, mine mi|&s;erable,
and this was an Inequality the mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential
that cou'd be imagin'd: As to that, my
Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I have taken &s;uch Mea&s;ures as &s;hall
make an Equality &s;till; and with that, he &s;hew'd
me a Contract in Writing, wherein he engag'd
him&s;elf to me; to cohabit con&s;tantly with me; to
provide for me in all Re&s;pects as a Wife; and re|peating
in the Preamble, a long Account of the
Nature and Rea&s;on of our living together, and an
Obligation in the Penalty of 7000 l. never to a|bandon
me; and at la&s;t, &s;hew'd me a Bond for
500 l. to be paid to me, or to my A&s;&s;igns, with|in
three Months after his Death.</P>
<P>He read over all the&s;e things to me, and then
in a mo&s;t moving, affectionate Manner, and in
Words not to be an&s;wer'd, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> Now, my
Dear, is this not &s;ufficient? Can you object any
<PB N="48" REF="53">
thing again&s;t it? If not, as I believe you will not,
then let us debate this Matter no longer; with
that, he pull'd out a &s;ilk Pur&s;e, which had three|&s;core
Guineas in it, and threw them into my Lap,
and concluded all the re&s;t of his Di&s;cour&s;e with
Ki&s;&s;es, and Prote&s;tations of his Love; of which
indeed, I had abundant Proof.</P>
<P>Pity humane Frailty, you that read of a Wo|man
reduc'd in her Youth, and Prime, to the ut|mo&s;t
Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s; and rais'd again, as
above, by the unexpected and &s;urprizing Bounty
of a Stranger; I &s;ay pity her if &s;he was not
able, after all the&s;e things, to make any more Re|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>However, I &s;tood out a little longer &s;till, I ask'd
him, how he cou'd expect that I cou'd come into a
Propo&s;al of &s;uch Con&s;equence, the very fir&s;t Time it
was mov'd to me? and that I ought (if I con&s;ented
to it) to capitulate with him, that he &s;hould never
upbraid me with Ea&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;enting too &s;oon:
<HI>He &s;aid,</HI> No; but on the contrary, he would take
it as a Mark of the greate&s;t Kindne&s;s I could &s;how
him; then he went on to give Rea&s;ons why there
was no Occa&s;ion to u&s;e the ordinary Ceremony of
Delay; or to wait a rea&s;onable Time of Court&s;hip,
which was only to avoid Scandal; but, as this was
private, it had nothing of that Nature in it; that he
had been courting me &s;ome time, by the be&s;t of
Court&s;hip, <HI>viz.</HI> doing Acts of Kindne&s;s to me; and
that he had given Te&s;timonies of his &s;incere Affecti|on
to me, by Deeds, not by flattering Trifles,
and the u&s;ual Court&s;hip of Words, which were of|ten
found to have very little Meaning; that he
took me not as a Mi&s;tre&s;s, but as his Wife; and
prote&s;ted, it was clear to him he might lawfully do
it, and that I was perfectly at Liberty; and a&s;&s;ur'd
me by all that it was po&s;&s;ible for an Hone&s;t Man
<PB N="49" REF="54">
to &s;ay, that he would treat me as his Wife, as
long as he liv'd; in a Word, he conquer'd all the
little Re&s;i&s;tance I intended to make; he prote&s;ted
he lov'd me above all the World, and begg'd I
would for once believe him; that he had never de|ceiv'd
me, and never would, but would make it
his Study to make my Life comfortable and
happy, and to make me forget the Mi&s;ery I had
gone through: I &s;tood &s;till a-whlie, and &s;aid no|thing,
but &s;eeing him eager for my An&s;wer,
I &s;mil'd, and looking up at him; and mu&s;t I then,
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> &s;ay Yes, at fir&s;t asking? Mu&s;t I depend up|on
your Promi&s;e? Why then, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> upon the
Faith of that Promi&s;e, and in the Sence of that
inexpre&s;&s;ible Kindne&s;s you have &s;hown me, you
&s;hall be oblig'd, and I will be wholly yours to the
End of my Life; and with that, I took his
Hand which held me by the Hand, and gave it
a Ki&s;s.</P>
<P>And thus in Gratitude for the Favours I receiv'd
from a Man, was all Sence of Religion, and Duty
to God, all Regard to Virtue and Honour, given
up at once, and we were to call one another Man
and Wife, who, in the Sence of the Laws, both of
God and our Country, were no more than two
Adulterers, in &s;hort, a Whore and a Rogue; nor,
as I have &s;aid above, was my Con&s;cience &s;ilent
in it, tho', it &s;eems, his was; for I &s;inn'd with
open Eyes, and thereby had a double Guilt upon
me; as I always &s;aid his Notions were of ano|ther
Kind, and he either was before of the Opi|nion,
or argued him&s;elf into it now, that we were
both Free, and might lawfully Marry.</P>
<P>But I was quite of another Side, my, and my
Judgment was right, but my Circum&s;tances were
my Temptation; the Terrors behind me look'd
blacker than the Terrors before me; and the
<PB N="50" REF="55">
dreadful Argument of wanting Bread, add being
run into the horrible Di&s;tre&s;&s;es I was in before,
ma&s;ter'd all my Re&s;olution, and I gave my&s;elf up,
as above.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Evening we &s;pent very agreea|bly
to me; he was perfectly good-humour'd, and
was at that time very merry; then he made <HI>Amy</HI>
dance with, him, and I told him, I wou'd put <HI>Amy</HI>
to Bed to him; <HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, with all her Heart, &s;he
never had been a Bride in her Life; in &s;hort, he
made the Girl &s;o merry, that had he not been
to lye with me the &s;ame Night, I believe he wou'd
have play'd the Fool with <HI>Amy</HI> for half an Hour,
and the Girl wou'd no more have refus'd him,
than I intended to do; yet before, I had always
found her a very mode&s;t Wench, as any I ever &s;aw
in all my Life; but, in &s;hort, the Mirth of that
Night, and a few more &s;uch afterwards, ruin'd
the Girl's Mode&s;ty for ever, as &s;hall appeal by and
by, in its Place.</P>
<P>So far does fooling and toying &s;ometimes go, that
I know nothing a young Woman has to be more
cautious of; &s;o far had this innocent Girl gone
in je&s;ting between her and I, and in talking that
&s;he would let him lye with her, if he would but
be kinder to me, that at la&s;t &s;he let him lye with
her in earne&s;t; and &s;o empty was I now of all
Principle, that I encourag'd the doing it almo&s;t
before my Face.</P>
<P>I &s;ay but too ju&s;tly, that I was empty of Prin|ciple,
beacuse, as above, I had yielded to him,
not as deluded to believe it Lawful, but as over|come
by his Kindne&s;s, and terrify'd at the Fear
of my own Mi&s;ery, if he &s;hould leave me; &s;o
with my Eyes open, and with my Con&s;cience, as
I may &s;ay, awake, I &s;inn'd, knowing it to be a
Sin, but having no Power to re&s;i&s;t; when this had
<PB N="51" REF="56">
thus made a Hole in my Heart, and I was come to
&s;uch a height, as to tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t the Light of
my own Con&s;cience, I was then fit for any Wick|edne&s;s,
and Con&s;cience left off &s;peaking, where
it found it cou'd not be heard.</P>
<P>But to return to our Story; having con&s;ented, as
above, to his Propo&s;al, we had not much more to
do; he gave me my Writings, and the Bond for
my Maintenance during his Life, and for 500 l. after
his Death; and &s;o far was he from abating his
Affection to me afterwards, that two Year after
we were thus, as he call'd it, Marry'd, he made
his Will, and gave me a Thou&s;and Pound more,
and all my Hou&s;hold-Stuff, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was
con&s;iderable too.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> put us to-Bed, and my new Friend, I
cannot call him Husband, was &s;o well pleas'd with
<HI>Amy,</HI> for her Fidelity and Kindne&s;s to me, that
he paid her all the Arrear of her Wages that I
ow'd her, and gave her five Guineas over, and
had it gone no farther, <HI>Amy</HI> Had richly de&s;erv'd
what &s;he had, for never was a Maid &s;o true to a
Mi&s;tre&s;s in &s;uch dreadful Circum&s;tances as I was
in; nor was what follow'd more her own Fault
than mine, who led her almo&s;t into it at fir&s;t, and
quite into it at la&s;t; and this may be a farther Te|&s;timony
what a hardne&s;s of Crime I was now ar|riv'd
to, which was owing to the Conviction that
was from the beginning, upon me, that I was a
Whore, not a Wife; nor cou'd I ever frame my
Mouth to call him Husband, or to &s;ay my Hu&s;|band,
when I was &s;peaking of him.</P>
<P>We liv'd, &s;urely, the mo&s;t agreeable Life, the
grand Exception only excepted, that ever Two
liv'd together; he was the mo&s;t obliging Gentle|manly
Man, and the mo&s;t tender of me, that ever

the lea&s;t Interruption to our mutual Kindne&s;s, no,
not to the la&s;t Day of his Life: But I mu&s;t bring
<HI>Amy</HI>'s Di&s;a&s;ter in an once, that I may have done
with her.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was dre&s;&s;ing me one Morning, for now I

Dear Madam, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> what, a'n't you with-Child

&s;ays I,</HI> let him try, can't yon: No, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> you'll

all my Heart, but I won't now, now he's all your

<P>I'll venture that, <HI>Amy, &s;ays I.</HI></P>
<P>After Supper, that Night, and before we were

Hark ye, Mr.&mdash;, Do you know that you are

&s;aid No &s;till, and it pa&s;s'd off.</P>
<P>At Night, when we came to go to-Bed, <HI>Amy</HI>
came into the Chamber to undre&s;s me, and her

Piece, and led her to the Bed to him: <HI>Here,</HI>
&s;ays I, <HI>try what you can do with your Maid</HI> Amy:
She pull'd back a little, would not let me pull off
her Cloaths at fir&s;t, but it was hot Weather, and
&s;he had not many Cloaths on, and particularly, no
Stays on; and at la&s;t, when &s;he &s;ee I was in earne&s;t,
&s;he let me do what I wou'd; &s;o I fairly &s;tript her,
and then I threw open the Bed, and thru&s;t her
in.</P>
<P>I need &s;ay no more; this is enough to con|vince
any-body that I did not think him my Hu&s;|band,

all Mode&s;ty, and had effectually &s;tifled Con|&s;cience.</P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> I dare &s;ay, began now to repent, and
wou'd fain have got out of Bed again; but he &s;aid
to her, Nay, <HI>Amy,</HI> you &s;ee your Mi&s;tre&s;s has put
you to-Bed, 'tis all her doing, you mu&s;t blame
her; &s;o he held her fa&s;t, and the Wench being
naked in the Bed with him, 'twas too late to
look back, &s;o &s;he lay &s;till, and let him do what
he wou'd with her.</P>
<P>Had I look'd upon my&s;elf as a Wife, you can|not
&s;uppo&s;e I would have been willing to have let
my Husband lye with my Maid, much le&s;s, be|fore
my Face, for I &s;tood-by all the while; but
as I thought my&s;elf a Whore, I cannot &s;ay but
<PB N="54" REF="59">
that it was &s;omething de&s;ign'd in my Thoughts, that
my Maid &s;hould be a Whore too, and &s;hould not
reproach me with it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> however, le&s;s vicious than I, was grievou&s;ly
out of Sorts the next Morning, and cry'd, and
took-on mo&s;t vehemently; that &s;he was ruin'd and
undone, and there was no pacifying her; &s;he was
a Whore, a Slut, and &s;he was undone! undone!
and cry'd almo&s;t all Day; I did all I could to
pacify her: A Whore! <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> well, and am not
I a Whore as well as you? No, no, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI>
no, you are not, for you are Marry'd not I, <HI>Amy,
&s;ays I,</HI> I do not pretend to it; he may Marry you
to-Morrow if he will, for any thing I cou'd do to
hinder it, I am not Marry'd, I do not look up|on
it as any thing: Well, all did not pacify <HI>Amy,</HI>
but &s;he cry'd two or three Days about it; but it
wore off by Degrees.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e differ'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and her Ma|&s;ter,
exceedingly; for <HI>Amy</HI> retain'd &s;he &s;ame kind
Temper &s;he always had; but on the contrary,
he was quite alter'd, for he hated her heartily,
and could, I believe, have kill'd her after it, and he
told me &s;o, for he thought this a vile Action;
whereas what he and I had done, he was per|fectly
ea&s;ie in, thought it ju&s;t, and e&s;teem'd me as
much his Wife as if we had been Marry'd from
our Youth, and had neither of us known any o|ther;
nay, he lov'd me, I believe, as entirely, as if I
had been the Wife of his Youth; nay, he told
me, it was true, in one Sence, that he had two
Wives, but that I was the Wife of his Affection,
the other, the Wife of his Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was extremely concern'd at the Aver&s;ion he
&s;iad taken to my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and us'd my utmo&s;t
Skill to get it alter'd; for tho' he had; indeed,
debauch'd the Wench, I knew that I was the
<PB N="55" REF="60">
principal Occa&s;ion of it; and as he was the be&s;t-humour'd
Man in the World, I never gave him
over till I prevail'd with him to be ea&s;ie with her,
and as I was now become the Devil's Agent, to
make others as wicked as my&s;elf, I brought him
to lye with her again &s;everal times after that, till
at la&s;t, as the poor Girl &s;aid, &s;o it happen'd, and
&s;he was really with-Child.</P>
<P>She was terribly concern'd at it, and &s;o was he
too: Come, my Dear <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> when <HI>Rachael</HI> put
her Handmaid to-Bed to <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;he took the
Children as her own; don't be unea&s;ie, I'll take
the Child as my own; had not I a hand in the
Frolick of putting her to-Bed to you? It was my
Fault as much as yours; &s;o I call'd <HI>Amy,</HI> and
encourag'd her too, and told her, that I wou'd
take Care of the Child and her too, and added
the &s;ame Argument to her; for, <HI>&s;ays I, Amy,</HI> it
was all my Fault; did not I drag your Cloaths off
of your Back, and put you to-Bed to him: Thus
I that had, indeed, been the Cau&s;e of all the Wick|edne&s;s
between them, encourag'd them both,
when they had any Remor&s;e about it, and ra|ther
prompted them to go on with it, than to
repent of it.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> grew Big, &s;he went to a Place I had
provided for her, and the Neighbours knew no|thing
but that <HI>Amy</HI> and I was parted; &s;he had a
fine Child indeed, a Daughter, and we had it
nurs'd, and <HI>Amy</HI> came again in about half a Year,
to live with her old Mi&s;tre&s;s; but neither my
Gentleman, or <HI>Amy</HI> either, car'd for playing that
Game over again; for as he haid, the Jade might
bring him a Hou&s;e-full of Children to keep.</P>
<P>We liv'd as merrily, and as happily, after this,
as cou'd be expected, con&s;idering our Circum|&s;tances;
I mean as to the pretended Marriage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="61">
and as to that, my Gentleman had not the lea&s;t
Concern about him for it; but as much as I was
harden'd, and that was as much, as I believe, ever
any wicked Creature was, yet I could not help it;
there was, and would be, Hours of Intervals, and
of dark Reflections which came involuntarily in,
and thru&s;t in Sighs into the middle of all my
Songs; and there would be, &s;ometimes, a heavi|ne&s;s
of Heart, which intermingl'd it&s;elf with all
my Joy, and which would often fetch a Tear
from my Eye; and let others pretend what they
will, I believe it impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e with
any-body; there can be no &s;ub&s;tantial Satisfaction
in a Life of known Wickedne&s;s; Con&s;cience will,
and does, often break in upon them at particular
times, let them do what they can to prevent it.</P>
<P>But I am not to preach, but to relate, and what|ever
loo&s;e Reflections were, and how often &s;oever
tho&s;e dark Intervals came on, I did my utmo&s;t to
conceal them from him; ay, and to &s;uppre&s;s and
&s;mother them too in my&s;elf, and to outward Ap|pearance
we liv'd as chearfully, and as agreeably, as
it was po&s;&s;ible for any Couple in the World to
live.</P>
<P>After I had thus liv'd with him &s;omething
above two Year, truly, I found my-&s;elf with-Child
too; my Gentleman was mightily pleas'd
at it, and nothing could be kinder than he
was in the Preparations he made for me, and
for my Lying-in, which was, however, very pri|vate,
becau&s;e I car'd for as little Company as po&s;&s;i|ble;
nor had I kept up my neighbourly Acquain|tance;
&s;o that I had no-body to invite upon &s;uch
an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was brought to-Bed very well, (of a Daughter
too, as well as <HI>Amy</HI>) but the Child died at about
&s;ix Weeks old, &s;o all that Work was to do over
<PB N="57" REF="62">
again, that is to &s;ay, the Charge, the Expence,
the Travel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The next Year I made him amends, and brought
him a Son, to his great Satisfaction; it was a
charming Child, and did very well: After this,
my Husband, as he call'd him&s;elf, came to me one
Evening, and told me, he had a very difficult
Thing happen'd to him, which he knew not what
to do in, or how to re&s;olve about, unle&s;s I would
make him ea&s;ie; this was, that his Occa&s;ions re|quir'd
him to go over to <HI>France</HI> for about two
Months.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and how &s;hall I make
you ea&s;ie?</P>
<P>Why, by con&s;enting to let me go, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> up|on
which Condition, I'll tell you the Occa&s;ion of
my going, that you may judge of the Nece&s;&s;ity
there is for it on my Side; then to make me ea&s;ie in
his going, he told me, he would make his Will be|fore
he went, which &s;hould be to my full Satis|faction.</P>
<P>I told him, the la&s;t Part was &s;o kind, that I
could not decline the fir&s;t Part, unle&s;s he would
give me Leave to add, that if it was not for put|ting
him to an extraordinary Expence, I would go
over along with him.</P>
<P>He was &s;o pleas'd with this Offer, that he told
me, he would give me full Satisfaction for it, and
accept of it too; &s;o he took me to <HI>London</HI> with
him the next Day, and there he made his WILL,
and &s;hew'd at to me, and &s;eal'd it before proper
Witne&s;&s;es, and then gave it to me to keep: In this
WILL he gave a thou&s;and Pounds to a Per&s;on that
we both knew very well, in Tru&s;t, to pay it, with
the Intere&s;t from the Time of his Decea&s;e, to me,
or my A&s;&s;igns; then he Will'd the Payment of
my Jointure, as he call'd it, <HI>viz.</HI> his Bond of a
<PB N="58" REF="63">
Hundred Pounds, after his Death; al&s;o he gave
me all my Hou&s;hold-Stuff, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This was a mo&s;t engaging thing for a Man to
do to one under my Circum&s;tances; and it would
have been hard, as I told him, to deny him any
thing, or to refu&s;e to go with him any where; &s;o
we &s;ettled every thing as well as we cou'd; left
<HI>Amy</HI> in Charge with the Hou&s;e; and for his other
Bu&s;ine&s;s, which was in Jewels, he had two Men
he entru&s;ted, who he had good Security for,
and who manag'd for him, and corre&s;ponded with
him.</P>
<P>Things being thus concerted, we went away to
<HI>France,</HI> arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>Calais,</HI> and by ea&s;ie Jour|neys,
came in eight Days more to <HI>Paris,</HI> where
we lodg'd in the Hou&s;e of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant of
his Acquaintance, and was very courteou&s;ly en|tertain'd.</P>
<P>My Gentleman's Bu&s;ine&s;s was with &s;ome Per|&s;ons
of the Fir&s;t Rank, and to whom he had &s;old
&s;ome Jewels of very good Value, and receiv'd a
great Sum of Money in Specie, and, as he told
me privately, he gain'd 3000 Pi&s;toles by his Bar|gain,
but would not &s;uffer the mo&s;t intimate
Friend he had there, to know what he had re|ceiv'd;
for it is not &s;o &s;afe a thing in <HI>Paris,</HI> to
have a great Sum of Money in keeping, as it might
be in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>We made this Journey much longer than we
intended; and my Gentleman lent for one of his
Managers in <HI>London,</HI> to come over to us to <HI>Paris</HI>
with &s;ome Diamonds, and &s;ent him back to <HI>London</HI>
again, to fetch more; then other Bu&s;ine&s;s fell into
his Hands &s;o unexpectedly, that I began to think we
&s;hould take up our con&s;tant Re&s;idence there, which
I was not very aver&s;e to it, being my Native
Country, and I &s;poke the Language perfectly well;
<PB N="59" REF="64">
&s;o we took a good Hou&s;e in <HI>Paris,</HI> and liv'd very
well there; and I &s;ent for <HI>Amy</HI> to come over to
me, for I liv'd gallantly, and my Gentleman was,
two or three times, going to keep me a Coach, but
I declin'd it, elpecially at <HI>Paris;</HI> but as they have
tho&s;e Conveniences by the Day there, at a certain
Rate, I had an Equipage provided for me when|ever
I pleas'd, and I liv it here in a very good Fi|gure,
and might have liv'd higher if I pleas'd.</P>
<P>But in the middle of all this Felicity, a dreadful
Di&s;a&s;ter befel me, which entirely unhing'd all
my Affairs, and threw me back into the &s;ame &s;tate
of Life that I was in before; with this one happy
Exception however, that whereas before I was
Poor, even to Mi&s;ery, now I was not only provi|ded
for, but very Rich.</P>
<P>My Gentleman had the Name in <HI>Paris,</HI> for a
very rich Man, and indeed, he was &s;o, tho' not
&s;o immen&s;ely rich as People imagin'd; but that
which was fatal to him, was, that he generally
carried a &s;hagreen Ca&s;e in his Pocket, e&s;pecially
when he went to Court, or to the Hou&s;es of any
of the Princes of the Blood, in which he had
Jewels of very great Value.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day, that being to go to <HI>Ver|&s;ailles,</HI>
to wait upon the Prince of&mdash;, he came
up into my Chamber in the Morning, and laid out
his Jewel-Ca&s;e, becau&s;e he was not going to &s;how
any Jewels, but to get a Foreign Bill accepted,
which he had receiv'd from <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> &s;o when
he gave me the Ca&s;e, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> My Dear, I think I
need not carry this with me, becau&s;e, it may be,
I may not come back till Night, and it is too much
to venture; I return'ed, then My Dear, you &s;ha'n't
go; Why? <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> becau&s;e as they are too much
for you, &s;o you are too much for me to venture; and
you &s;hall not go, unle&s;s you will promi&s;e me not to
&s;tay &s;o as to come $span$.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="65">
I hope there's no Danger, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> &s;eeing I have
nothing about me of any Value; and therefore,
le&s;t I &s;hould, take that too, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and gives me
his Gold Watch, and a rich Diamond, which he
had in a Ring, and always wore on his Finger.</P>
<P>Well, but <HI>my Dear, &s;ays I,</HI> you make me more
unea&s;ie now, than before; for if you apprehend
no Danger, why do u&s;e this Caution? and if you
apprehend there is Danger, why do you go at
all?</P>
<P>There is no Danger, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if I do not &s;tay late,
and I do not de&s;ign to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Well, but promi&s;e me then, that you won't, <HI>&s;ays
I,</HI> or el&s;e I cannot let you go.</P>
<P>I wont, indeed, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> unle&s;s I am
oblig'd to it; I a&s;&s;ure you I do not intend it;
but if I &s;hou'd, I am not worth robbing now; for
I have nothing about me, but about &s;ix Pi&s;toles in
my little Pur&s;e, and that little Ring, &s;howing me
a &s;mall Diamond Ring, worth about ten or twelve
Pi&s;toles, which he put upon his Finger, in the
room of the rich one he u&s;ually wore.</P>
<P>I &s;till pre&s;s'd him not to &s;tay late, and he &s;aid he
wou'd not; but if I am kept late, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> beyond my
Expectation, I'll &s;tay all Night, and come next
Morning: This &s;eem'd a very good Caution; but
&s;till my Mind was very unea&s;ie about him, and I
told him &s;o, and entreated him not to go; I told
him, I did not know what might be the rea&s;on, but
that I had a &s;trange Terror upon my Mind, about
his going, and that, if he did go, I was per&s;waded
&s;ome Harm wou'd attend him; he &s;mil'd, and
return'd, Well, my Dear, if it &s;hould be &s;o, you
are now richly provided for; all that I have here,
I give to you; and with that, he takes up the
Casket, or Ca&s;e, Here, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> hold your Hand,
there is a good E&s;tate for you, in this Ca&s;e; if
<PB N="61" REF="66">
any thing happens to me, 'tis all your own, I
give it you for your&s;elf; and with that, he put
the Casket, the fine Ring, and his Gold Watch,
all into my Hands, and the Key of his Srutore be|&s;ides,
adding, and in my Scrutore there is &s;ome
Money, 'tis all your own.</P>
<P>I &s;tar'd at him, as if I was frighted, for I
thought all his Face look'd like a Death's-Head;
and then, immediately, I thought I perceiv'd his
Head all Bloody; and then his Cloaths look'd
Bloody too; and immediately it all went off, and
he look'd as he really did; immediately I fell a-crying,
and hung about him, My Dear <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I
am frighted to Death; you &s;hall not go, depend
upon it, &s;ome Mi&s;chief will befal you; I did
not tell him how my vapouri&s;h Fancy had repre|&s;ented
him to me, that I thought was not proper;
be&s;ides he wou'd only have laugh' d at me, and
wou'd have gone away with a Je&s;t about it: But
I pre&s;s'd him &s;eriou&s;ly not to go that Day, or if
he did, to promi&s;e me to come Home to <HI>Paris</HI> a|gain
by Day-light: he look'd a little graver then,
than he did before; told me, he was not appre|hen&s;ive
of the lea&s;t Danger; but if there was, he
wou'd either take Care to come in the Day, or,
as he had &s;aid before, wou'd &s;tay all Night.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Promi&s;es came to nothing; for he
was &s;et upon in the open Day, and robb'd, by three
Men on Hor&s;eback, mask'd, as he went; and one
of them, who, it &s;eems, rifled him, while the
re&s;t &s;tood to &s;top the Coach, &s;tabb'd him into the
Body with a Sword, &s;o that he died immediate|ly:
He had a Footman behind the Coach, who
they knock'd down with the Stock, or But-end
of a Carabine: They were &s;uppos'd to kill him,
becau&s;e of the Di&s;appointment they met with, in
not getting his Ca&s;e, or Casket of Diamonds, which
<PB N="62" REF="67">
they knew he carry'd about him; and this was
&s;uppos'd, becau&s;e after they had kill'd him, they
made the Coachman drive out of the Road, a
long-Way over the Heath, till they came to a con|venient
Place, where they pull'd him out of the
Coach, and &s;earch'd his Cloaths more narrowly,
than they cou'd do while he was alive.</P>
<P>But they found nothing but his little Ring, &s;ix
Pi&s;toles, and the Value of about &s;even Livres in
&s;mall Moneys.</P>
<P>This was a dreadful Blow to me; tho' I cannot
&s;ay I was &s;o &s;urpriz'd as I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have
been; for all the while he was gone, my Mind
was oppre&s;s'd with the Weight of my own
Thoughts; and I was as &s;ure that I &s;hould ne|ver
&s;ee him any more, that I think nothing could
be like it the Impre&s;&s;ion was &s;o &s;trong, that, I
think, nothing could make &s;o deep a Wound,
that was imaginary; and I was &s;o dejected, and
di&s;con&s;olate, that when I received the News of
his Di&s;a&s;ter, there was no room for any extraor|dinary
Alteration in me: I had cry'd all that Day,
eat nothing, and only waited, as I might &s;ay, to
receive the di&s;mal News, which I had brought to
me about Five a-Clock in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>I was in a &s;trange Country; and tho' I had a
pretty many Acquaintances, had but very few
Friends that I could con&s;ult on this Occa&s;ion;
all po&s;&s;ible Enquiry was made after the Rogues,
that had been thus barbarous, but nothing could
be heard of them; nor was it po&s;&s;ible, that
the Footman could make any Di&s;covery of them,
by his De&s;cription; for they knock'd him down
immediately, &s;o that he knew nothing of what
was done afterwards; the Coachman was the on|ly
Man that cou'd &s;ay any thing, and all his Ac|count
amounted to no more than this, that one
<PB N="63" REF="68">
of them had Soldiers Cloaths, but he cou'd not
remember the Particulars of his Mounting, &s;o as
to know what Regiment he belong'd to; and as
to their Faces, that he could know nothing of,
becau&s;e they had all of them Masks on.</P>
<P>I had him Buried as decently as the Place would
permit a Prote&s;tant Stranger to be Buried, and
made &s;ome of the Scruples and Difficulties on that
Account, ea&s;ie, by the help of Money to a cer|tain
Per&s;on, who went impudently to the Curate
of the Pari&s;h St. <HI>Sulpitius,</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> and told him,
that the Gentleman that was kill'd, was a Catho|lick;
that the Thieves had taken from him a
Cro&s;s of Gold, &s;et with Diamonds, worth 6000
Livres; that his Widow was a Catholick, and
had &s;ent by him 60 Crowns to the Church of&mdash;,
for Ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid for the Repo&s;e of
his Soul: Upon all which, <HI>tho' not one Word of it
was true,</HI> he was Buried with all the Ceremonies
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<P>I think I almo&s;t cry'd my&s;elf to Death for him;
for I abandon'd my&s;elf to all the Exce&s;&s;es of
Grief; and indeed, I lov'd him to a Degree inex|pre&s;&s;ible;
and con&s;idering what Kindne&s;s he had
&s;hewn me at fir&s;t, and how tenderly he had us'd
me to the la&s;t, what cou'd I do le&s;s?</P>
<P>Then the Manner of his Death was terrible and
frightful to me, and above all, the &s;trange Notices
I had of it; I had never pretended to the Second-Sight,
or any thing of that Kind; but certainly,
if any one ever had &s;uch a thing, I had it at this
time; for I &s;aw him as plainly in all tho&s;e terrible
Shapes, as above, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as a Skeleton, not Dead
only, but rotten and wa&s;ted; <HI>Secondly,</HI> as kill'd,
and his Face bloody; and <HI>Thirdly,</HI> his Cloaths
bloody; and all within the Space of one Minute,
or indeed, of a very few Moments.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="69">
The&s;e things amaz'd me, and I was a good-while
as one &s;tupid; however, after &s;ome time, I
began to recover, and look into my Affairs; I had
the Satisfaction not to be left in Di&s;tre&s;s, or in
danger of Poverty; on the contrary, be&s;ides what
he had put into my Hands fairly, in his Life-time
which amounted to a very con&s;iderable Value I
found above &s;even Hundred Pi&s;toles in Gold, in
his Scrutore, of which he had given me the Key;
and I found Foreign-Bills accepted, for about
12000 Livres; &s;o that, in a Word, I found my|&s;elf
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of almo&s;t ten Thou&s;and Pounds
Sterling, in a very few Days after the Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I did upon this Occa&s;ion, was,
to &s;end a Letter to my Maid, as I &s;till call'd her,
<HI>Amy;</HI> wherein I gave her an Account of my Di&s;|a&s;ter,
how my Husband, as &s;he call'd him (<HI>for I
never call'd him &s;o</HI>) was murther'd; and as I did
not know how his Relations, or his Wife's Friends,
might act upon than Occa&s;ion, I order'd her to
convey away all the Plate, Linnen, and other
things of Value, and to &s;ecure them in a Per&s;on's
Hands that I directed her to, and then to &s;ell,
or di&s;po&s;e the Furniture of the Hou&s;e, if &s;he
could; and &s;o, without acquainting any-body with
the Rea&s;on of her going, withdraw; &s;ending No|tice
to his Head Manager at <HI>London,</HI> that the
Hou&s;e was quitted by the Tennant, and they
might come and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for the Exe|cutors:
<HI>Amy</HI> was &s;o dext'rous, and did her Work
&s;o nimbly, that &s;he gutted the Hou&s;e, and &s;ent
the Key to the &s;aid Manager, almo&s;t as &s;oon as
he had Notice of the Misfortune that befel their
Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Upon their receiving the &s;urprizing News of
his Death, the Head Manager came over to <HI>Paris,</HI>
and came to the Hou&s;e; I made no Scruple of
<PB N="65" REF="70">
calling my&s;elf Madam&mdash;, the Widow of Mon|&s;ieur&mdash;,
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Jeweller; and as I &s;poke
<HI>French</HI> naturally, I did not let him know but that
I was his Wife, married in <HI>France,</HI> and that I had
not heard that he had any Wife in <HI>England;</HI> but
pretended to be &s;urpriz'd and exclaim again&s;t him
for &s;o ba&s;e an Action; and that I had good
Friend in <HI>Poictou,</HI> where I was Born, who would
take Care to have Ju&s;tice done me in <HI>England,</HI> out
of his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erv'd, that as &s;oon as the News
was publick, of a Man being murther'd, and that
he was a jeweller, Fame did me the Favour as
to publi&s;h pre&s;ently, that he was robb'd of his
Casket of Jewels, which he always carry'd about
him; I confirm'd this, among my daily Lamenta|tions
for his Di&s;a&s;ter, and added, that he had
with him a fine Diamond Ring, which he was
known to wear frequently about him, valued at
100 Pi&s;toles, a Gold Watch, and a great Quantity
of Diamonds of ine&s;timable Value, in his Casket;
which Jewels he was carrying to the Prince of&mdash;,
to &s;how &s;ome of them to him; and the
Princc own'd, that he had &s;poken to him to bring
&s;ome &s;uch Jewels, to let him &s;ee them. But I &s;orely
repented this Part afterward as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>This Rumour put an End to all Enquiry after
his Jewells, his Ring, or his Watch; and as
for the 700 Pi&s;toles, that I &s;ecur'd: For the
Bills which, were in hand, I own'd I had them;
but that, as <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> I brought my Husband 30000
Livres Portion, I claim'd the &s;aid Bills, which
came to not above 12000 Livres, for my <HI>Amende;</HI>
and this, with the Plate, and the Hou&s;hold-Stuff,
was the principal of all his E&s;tate which they
could come at; as to the Foreign-Bill, which he
was going to <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> to get accepted, it was real|ly
<PB N="66" REF="71">
lo&s;t with him; but his Manager, who had re|mitted
the Bill to him, by Way of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI>
bringing over the &s;econd Bill, the Money was &s;av'd,
as, they call'd it, which would, otherwi&s;e, have
been al&s;o gone; the Thieves who robb'd and
murther'd him, were, to be &s;ure, afraid to &s;end
any-body to get the Bill accepted; for that would
undoubtedly have di&s;cover'd them.</P>
<P>By this time my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> was arriv'd, and
&s;he gave me an Account of her Management, and
how &s;he had &s;ecur'd every thing, and that &s;he had
quitted the Hou&s;e, and &s;ent the Key to the Head-Manager
of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and let me know how
much &s;he had made of every thing, very punctu|ally
and hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erv'd in the Account of his
dwelling with me &s;o long at&mdash;, that he never pa&s;s'd
for any thing there, but a Lodger in the Hou&s;e;
and tho' he was Landlord, that did not alter the
Ca&s;e; &s;o that at his Death <HI>Amy</HI> coming to quit
the Hou&s;e, and give them the Key, there was no
affinity between that, and the Ca&s;e of their Ma|&s;ter,
who was newly kill'd.</P>
<P>I got good Advice at <HI>Paris,</HI> from an eminent
Lawyer, a Coun&s;ellor of the Parliament there,
and laying my Ca&s;e before him, he directed me
to make a Proce&s;s in Dower upon the E&s;tate, for
making good my new Fortune upon Matrimony,
which accordingly I did and, upon the whole,
the Manager went back to <HI>England,</HI> well &s;atisfied,
that he had gotten the unaccepted Bills of Ex|change,
which was for 2500 l. with &s;ome other
things, which together, amounted to 17000 Li|vres;
and thus I got rid of him.</P>
<P>I was vi&s;ited with great Civility on this &s;ad
Occa&s;ion, of the Lo&s;s of my Husband, as they
thought him, by a great many Ladies of Quality;
<PB N="67" REF="72">
anid the Prince of&mdash;, to whom it was reported
he was carrying the Jewels, &s;ent his Gentleman
with a very hand&s;ome Compliment of Condolance
to me and his Gentleman, whether with, or
without Order, hinted, as if his Highne&s;s did in|tend
to have vi&s;ited me him&s;elf, but that &s;ome Ac|cident
which he made a long Story of, had pre|vented
him.</P>
<P>By the Concour&s;e of Ladies and others, that
thus came to vi&s;it me, I began to be much known;
and as I did not forget to let my&s;elf out with all
po&s;&s;ible Advantage, considering the Dre&s;s of a
Widow, which in tho&s;e Days was a mo&s;t fright|ful
thing; I &s;ay, as I did thus from my own
Vanity, for I was not ignorant that I was very
hand&s;ome I &s;ay, on this Account, I was &s;oon
made very publick, and was known by the Name
of <HI>La Belle veufeu de Poictou;</HI> or, The pretty Wi|dow
of <HI>Poictou:</HI> As I was very well pleas'd to &s;ee
my&s;elf thus hand&s;omely us'd in my Affliction, it
&s;oon dry'd up all my Tears; and tho' I appear'd
as a Widow, yet, as we lay in <HI>England,</HI> it was
of a Widow comforted: I took Care to let the
Ladies &s;ee, that I know how to receive them;
that I was not at a Lo&s;s how to Behave to any
of them; and in &s;hort, I began to be very popu|lar
there but I had an Occa&s;ion afterwards, which
made me decline that kind of Management, as
you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>About four Days after I had received the Com|pliments
of Condolance from the Prince&mdash;,
the &s;ame Gentleman he had &s;ent before, came to
tell me, that his Highne&s;s was coming to give me a
Vi&s;it; I was indeed, &s;uprized at that, and perfect|ly
at a Lo&s;s how to Behave: However, as there
was no Remedy, I prepar'd to receive him as well
as I cou'd; it was not many Minutes after, but
<PB N="68" REF="73">
he was at the Door, and came in, introduc'd by
his own Gentleman, as above, and after, by my
Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI></P>
<P>He treated me with abundance of Civility,
and condol'd hand&s;omely the Lo&s;s of my Hus|band,
and likewi&s;e the Manner of it; he told me,
he under&s;tood he was coming to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> to
him&s;elf, to &s;hew him &s;ome Jewels; that it was
true, that he had di&s;cours'd with him about
Jewels, but cou'd not imagine how any Villains
&s;hou'd hear of his coming at that time with them;
that he had not order'd him to attend with
them at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> but told him, that he would
come to <HI>Paris</HI> by &s;uch a Day, &s;o that he was no
way acce&s;&s;ary to the Di&s;a&s;ter: I told him grave|ly,
I knew very well that all his Highne&s;s
had &s;aid of that Part, was true; that the&s;e Vil|lains
knew his Profe&s;&s;ion, and knew, no doubt,
that he always carry'd a Casket of Jewels about
him, and than he always, wore a Diamond Ring
on his Finger, worth a hundred Pi&s;toles, which
Report had magnified to five Hundred and that
if he had been going to any other Place, it wou'd
have been the &s;ame thing; After this, his High|ne&s;s
ri&s;e up to go, and told me, he had re&s;olv'd
however, to make me &s;omee Reparation; and
with the&s;e Words, put a &s;ilk Pur&s;e into my
Hand, with a hundred Pi&s;toles, and told me, he
would make me a farther Compliment of a &s;mall
Pen&s;ion, which, his Gentleman would inform me of.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure I behav'd with a due Sence of
&s;o much Goodne&s;s, and offer'd to kneel to ki&s;s his
Hand, but he took me up, and &s;aluted me, and
&s;at down again, (<HI>tho' before he made as if he was
going away,</HI> making me &s;it down by him.</P>
<P>He then begun to talk with me more familiarly;
told me, he hop'd I was not left in bad Circum|&s;tances;
<PB N="69" REF="74">
that Mr.&mdash;was reputed to be very
Rich, and that he had gain'd lately great Sums
by &s;ome Jewels; and he hop'd, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that I had
&s;till a Fortune agreeable to the Condition I had
liv'd in before.</P>
<P>I reply'd, with &s;ome Tears, which, I confe&s;s,
were a little forc'd, That I believ'd if Mr.&mdash;had
liv'd, we &s;hou'd have been out of Danger of Want;
but that it was impo&s;&s;ible to E&s;timate the Lo&s;s
which I had &s;u&s;tain'd, be&s;ides that of the Life of
my Husband; that by the Opinion of tho&s;e that
knew &s;omething of his Affairs, and of what Va|lue
the Jewels were which he intended to have
&s;hown to <HI>his Highne&s;s,</HI> he could not have le&s;s about
him, than the Value of a hundred Thou&s;and Li|vres
that it was a fatal Blow to me, and to his
whole Family, e&s;pecially that they &s;hould be lo&s;t
in &s;uch a Manner.</P>
<P>His Highne&s;s return'd, with an Air of Concern,
that he was very &s;orry for it; but he hop'd, if I
&s;ettled in <HI>Paris,</HI> I might find Ways to re&s;tore my
Fortune; at the &s;ame time he complimented me
upon my being very hand&s;ome, <HI>as he was pleas'd to
call it,</HI> and that I could not fail of Admirers: I
&s;tood up, and humbly thank'd <HI>his Highne&s;s,</HI> but
told him, I had no Expectations of that Kind;
that I thought I &s;hould be oblig'd to go over to
<HI>England,</HI> to look after my Husband's Effects there,
which I was told, were con&s;iderable; but that I
did not know what Ju&s;tice a poor Stranger wou'd
get among them; and as for <HI>Paris,</HI> my Fortune be|ing
&s;o impair'd, I &s;aw nothing before me, but to go
back to <HI>Poictou,</HI> to my Friends, where &s;ome of
my Relations, I hop'd, might do &s;omething for
me, and added, that one of my Brothers was an
<HI>Abbot</HI> at&mdash;, near <HI>Poictiers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="75">
He &s;tood up, and taking me by the Hand, led
me to a large Looking-Gla&s;s, which made up the
Peir in the Front of the Parlour; Look there,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> Is it fit that Face, pointing to
my Figure in the Gla&s;s, &s;hould go back to <HI>Poictou?</HI>
No, Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;tay, and make &s;ome Gen|tleman
of Quality happy, that may, in return,
make you forget all your Sorrows; and with that,
he took me in his Arms, and ki&s;&s;ng me twice, told
me, he wou'd &s;ee me again, but with le&s;s Cere|mony.</P>
<P>Some little time after this, but the &s;ame Day,
his Gentleman came to me again, and with great
Ceremony and Re&s;pect, deliver'd men Black Box
ty'd with a Scarlet Ribband, and &s;eal'd with a
noble Coat of Arms, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, was the
Prince's; there was in it a Grant from his High|ne&s;s,
or an A&s;&s;ignment, I know not which to call
it, with a Warrant to his Banker to pay me two
Thou&s;and Livres a Year, during my Stay in <HI>Paris,</HI>
as the Widow of Mon&s;ieur&mdash;the Jeweller, men|tioning
the horrid Murther of my late Husband,
as the Occa&s;ion of it, as above.</P>
<P>I receiv'd it with great Submi&s;&s;ion, and Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of being infinitely oblig'd to his Ma&s;ter,
and of my &s;howing my&s;elf on all Occa&s;ions, <HI>his
his Highne&s;s's</HI> mo&s;t obedient Servant; and after giving
my mo&s;t humble Duty to <HI>his Highne&s;s,</HI> with the
utmo&s;t Acknowledgments of the Obligation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
I went to a little Cabinet, and taking out &s;ome
Money, which made a little Sound in taking it
out, offer'd to give him five Pi&s;toles.</P>
<P>He drew back, but with the greate&s;t Re&s;pect,
and told me, he humbly thank'd me, but that he
dur&s;t not take a Farthing; that <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> wou'd
take it &s;o ill of him, he was &s;ure, he would never
&s;ee his face more; but that he wou'd not fail
<PB N="71" REF="76">
to acquaint his Highne&s;s what Re&s;pect I had of|fer'd;
and added, I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, you are
more in the good Graces of my Ma&s;ter, the
Prince of&mdash;, than you are aware of; and I
believe you will hear more of him.</P>
<P>Now I began to under&s;tand him, and re&s;olv'd
if his Highne&s;s did come again, he &s;hould &s;ee me
under no Di&s;advantages, if I could help it: I told
him, if <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> did me the Honour to &s;ee me
again, I hop'd he would not let me be &s;o &s;urpriz'd
as I was before; that I would be glad to have
&s;ome little Notice of it, and would be oblig'd to
him, if he would procure it me; he told me, he
was very &s;ure, that when <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> intended to
vi&s;it me, he &s;hould be &s;ent before, to give me
Notice of it; and that he would give me as much
Warning of it, as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>He came &s;everal times after this, on the &s;ame
Errand, that is, about the Settlement, the Grant,
requiring &s;everal things yet to be done, for making
it payable, without going every time to the Prince
again for a fre&s;h Warrant; the Particulars of
this Part I did not under&s;tand; but as &s;oon as it
was fini&s;h'd, which was above two Months, the
Gentleman came one Afternoon, and &s;aid, <HI>his
Highne&s;s</HI> de&s;ign'd to vi&s;it me in the Evening;
but de&s;ir'd to be admitted without Ceremony.</P>
<P>I prepar'd not my Rooms only, but my&s;elf;
and when he came in, there was no-body ap|pear'd
in the Hou&s;e but his Gentleman, and my
Maid <HI>Amy;</HI> and of her I bid the Gentleman ac|quaint
<HI>his Highne&s;s,</HI> that &s;he was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wo|man;
that &s;he did not under&s;tand a Word of
<HI>French;</HI> and that &s;he was one al&s;o that might be
tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>When he came into my Room, I fell down at
his Feet, before he could come to &s;alute me,
<PB N="72" REF="77">
and with Words that I had prepar'd, full of Duty
and Re&s;pect, thank'd him for his Bounty and
Goodne&s;s to a poor de&s;olate Woman, oppre&s;s'd
under the Weight of &s;o terrible a Di&s;a&s;ter, and
refus'd to ri&s;e till he would allow me the Honour
to ki&s;s his Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Levez vous donc,</HI> &s;ays the Prince, taking me in
his Arms, I de&s;ign more Favours for you, than
this Trifle and going on, he added, You &s;hall,
for the future, find a Friend where you did not
look for it; and I re&s;olve to let you &s;ee how
kind I can be, to one, who is to me the mo&s;t a|greeable
Creature on Earth.</P>
<P>I was dre&s;s'd in a kind of half-Mourning, had
turn'd off my Weeds, and my Head, <HI>tho' I had
yet no Ribbands or Lace,</HI> was &s;o dre&s;s'd, as fail'd
not to &s;et me out with Advantage enough, for I
began to under&s;tand his Meaning; and the Prince
profe&s;s'd, I was the mo&s;t beautiful Creature on
Earth; <HI>and where have, I liv'd?</HI> &s;ays he and how
ill have I been &s;ev'd that I &s;hould never till now,
be &s;hew'd the fine&s;t Woman in France?</P>
<P>This was the Way, in ail the World, the mo&s;t
likely to break in upon my Virtue, if I had been
Mi&s;tre&s;s of any, for I was now become the vain|e&s;t
Creature upon Earth, and particularly, of my
Beauty; which, as other People admir'd, &s;o I be|came
every Day more &s;ooli&s;hly in Love with my|&s;elf,
than before.</P>
<P>He &s;aid &s;ome very kind Things to me after this,
and &s;at down with me, for an Hour, or more;
when getting up, and calling his Gentleman,
by his Name, he threw open the Door, <HI>Au Boir,
&s;ays he;</HI> upon which, his Gentleman immediately
brought up a Jittle Table, cover'd with a fine Da|mask
Cloth, the Table no bigger than, he cou'd
brng in his two Hands; but upon it, was &s;et two
<PB N="73" REF="78">
Decanters, one of Champaign, and the other of
Water, &s;ix Silver Plates, and a Service of &s;ine
Sweet-Meats in fine <HI>China</HI> Di&s;hes, on a Sett of
Rings &s;tanding up about twenty Inches high, one
above another; below, was three roa&s;ted Partri|ges
and a Quail; as &s;oon as his Gentleman had
&s;et it all down, he ordered him to withdraw;
now, <HI>&s;ays the Prince,</HI> I intend to Sup with you.</P>
<P>When he &s;ent away his Gentleman, I &s;tood up,
and offer'd to wait on <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> while he Eat,
but he po&s;itively refus'd, and told me, No, To-Morrow
you &s;hall be the Widow of Mon&s;ieur&mdash;the
Jeweller, but to-Night you &s;hall be my Mi&s;|tre&s;s;
therefore &s;it here, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and Eat with me,
or I will get up and &s;erve.</P>
<P>I would then have call'd tip my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI>
but I thought that would not be proper neither;
&s;o I made my Excu&s;e, that &s;ince <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> wou'd
not let his own Servant wait, I wou'd not pre&s;ume
to let my Woman come up; but if he wou'd
plca&s;e to let me wait, it would be my Honour to
fill <HI>his Highne&s;s's Wine;</HI> but, as before, he Would
by no means allow me; &s;o we &s;at and Eat toge|ther.</P>
<P>Now, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Prince,</HI> give me leave to
lay a&s;ide my Character; let us talk together with
the Freedom of Equals; my Quality &s;ets me at a
Di&s;tance From you, and makes you ceremonious;
your Beauty exalts you to more than an Equality,
I mu&s;t then treat you, as Lovers do their
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, but I cannot &s;peak the Language
'tis enough to tell you, how agreeable you are to
me how I am &s;urpriz'd at your Beauty, and re|&s;olve
to make you happy, and to be happy with
you.</P>
<P>I knew not what to &s;ay to him a good-while,
but blu&s;h'd, und looking up towards him, &s;aid,
<PB N="74" REF="79">
I was already made happy, in the Favour of a
per&s;on of &s;uch Rank; and had nothing to ask of
<HI>his Highne&s;s,</HI> but that he would believe me in&s;i|nitely
oblig'd.</P>
<P>After he had Eaten, he pour'd the Sweet-Meats
into my Lap; and the Wine being out, he call'd
his Gentleman again, to take away the Table,
who, at fir&s;t, only took the Cloth, and the Remains
of what was to Eat, away and laying another
Cloth, &s;et the Table on one &s;ide of the Room,
with a noble Service of Plate upon it, worth, at
lea&s;t, 200 Pi&s;toles; then having &s;et the two De|canters
again upon the Table, fill'd, as before,
he withdrew, for I found the Fellow under&s;tood
his Bu&s;ine&s;s very well, and his Lord's Bu&s;ine&s;s
too.</P>
<P>About half an Hour after, the Prince told me,
that I offer'd to wait a little before; that if I
would now take the Trouble, he would give me
leave to give him &s;ome Wine; &s;o I went to the
Table, fill'd a Gla&s;s of Wine, and brought it to
him, on a fine Salver, which the Gla&s;&s;es &s;tood on,
and brought the Bottle, or Decanter for Water, in
my other Hand, to mix it as he thought fit.</P>
<P>He &s;mil'd, and bid me look on that Salver,
which I did, and admir'd it much, for it was a
very fine one, indeed: You may &s;ee, <HI>&s;ays be,</HI> I re|&s;olve
to have more of your Company, for ray Ser|vant
&s;hall leave you that Plate, for my U&s;e: I
told him, I believ'd <HI>his Higne&s;s</HI> wou'd not take
it ill, that I was not Furni&s;h'd fit to Entertain a
Per&s;on of his Rank; and that I would take great
Care of it, and value my&s;elf infinitely upon the
Honour of <HI>his Highne&s;'s Vi&s;it.</HI></P>
<P>It now began to grow late, and he began to take
Notice of it but, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I cannot leave you;
have you not a &s;pare Lodging, fo$ one Night? I
<PB N="75" REF="80">
told him, I had but a homely Lodging to Enter|tain
&s;uch a Gue&s;t; he laid &s;omething exceed|ing
kind on that Head, but not fit to repeat;
adding, that my Company would make him a|mends.</P>
<P>About Midnight he &s;ent his Gentleman of an
Errand, after telling him, aloud, that he in|tended
to &s;tay here all Night in a little time
his Gentleman brought him a Night-Gown, Slip|pers,
two Caps, a Neckcloth, and Shirt, which
he gave me to carry into his Chamber, and &s;ent
his Man home; and then turning to me, &s;aid,
I &s;hou'd do him the Honour to Be his Chamber|lain
of the Hou&s;hold, and his Dre&s;&s;er al&s;o:
I &s;mil'd, and told him, I wou'd do my&s;eif the
Honour to wait on him upon all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>About One in the Morning, while his Gentle|man
was yet with him, I begg'd Leave to withdraw,
&s;uppo&s;ing he wou'd go to-Bed but he took the
Hint, and &s;aid, I'm not going to-Bed yet; pray
let me &s;ee you again.</P>
<P>I took this time to undre&s;s me, and to come in
a new Dre&s;s, which was, in a manner, <HI>une De&s;ha|bile,</HI>
but &s;o fine, and all about me &s;o clean, and &s;o
agreeable, that he &s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd: I thought,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you could not have dre&s;s'd to more Advan|tage,
than you had done before; but now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>

I may the better wait on <HI>your Highne&s;s;</HI> he pulls

and &s;itting on the Bed-&s;ide, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Now you
&s;hall be a Prince&s;s, and know what it is to oblige
the gratefulle&s;t Man alive; and with that, he took
me in his Arms,&mdash;I can go no farther in the
Particulars of what pa&s;s'd at that time; but it
<PB N="76" REF="81">
ended in this, that, in &s;hort, I lay with him all
Night.</P>
<P>I have given you the whole Detail of this Story,
to lay it down as a black Scheme of the Way how
Unhappy Women are ruin'd by Great Men; for
tho' Poverty and Want is an irre&s;i&s;tible Tempta|tion
to the Poor, Vanity and Great Things are as
irre&s;i&s;tible to others to be courted by a Prince,
and by a Prince who was fir&s;t a Benefactor, then an
Admirer; to be call'd hand&s;ome, the fine&s;t Wo|man
in <HI>France,</HI> and to be treated as a Woman fit
for the Bed of a Prince; the&s;e are Things, a
Woman mu&s;t have no Vanity in her, nay, no
Corruption in her, that is not overcome by it
and my Cafe was &s;uch, that, as before, I had e|nough
of both,</P>
<P>I had now no Poverty attending me on the
contrary, I was Mi&s;tre&s;s of ten Thou &s;and Pounds
before the Prince did any thing for me; had I
been Mi&s;tre&s;s of my Re&s;olution; had I been le&s;s
obliging, and rejected the fir&s;t Attack, all had
been &s;afe; but my Virtue was lo&s;t before, and the
Devil, who had found the Way to break-in upon
me by one Temptation, ca&s;ily ma&s;ter'd me now,
by another and I gave my&s;elf up to a Per&s;on,
who, tho' a of high Dignity, was yet the
mo&s;t tempting and obliging, that ever I met with
in my Life.</P>
<P>I had the &s;ame Particular to in&s;i&s;t upon here
with the Prince, that I had with my Gentleman
before; I he&s;itated much at con&s;enting, at fir&s;t
asking; but the Prince told me, Princes did not
court like other Men; that they brought more
powerful Arguments; and he very prettily added,
that they were &s;ooner repuls'd than other Men, and
ought to be &s;ooner comply'd with intimating,
tho' very genteely, that after a Woman had po&s;i|tively
<PB N="77" REF="82">
refus'd him once, he cou'd not, like other
Men, wait with Importunities and Stratagems
and laying-long Sieges; but as &s;uch Men as he
Storm'd warmly, &s;o, if repuls'd, they made no &s;e|cond
Attacks; and indeed it was but rea&s;onable;
for as it was below their Rank, to be long battering
a Woman 's Con&s;tancy, &s;o they ran greater Ha|zards
in being expos'd in their Amours, than
other Men did.</P>
<P>I took this for a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer, and told
<HI>his Highne&s;s,</HI> that I had the &s;ame Thoughts, in re|&s;pect
to the Manner of his Attacks, for that his
Per&s;on, and his Arguments were irre&s;i&s;tible; that
a Per&s;on of his Rank; and a Munificence &s;o un|bounded,
cou'd not be with&s;tood; that no Virtue
was Proof again&s;t him, except &s;uch, as was able
too, to &s;uffer Martyrdom; that I thought it im|po&s;&s;ible
I cou'd be overcome, but that now I
found it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hou'd not be overcome;
that &s;o much Goodne&s;s, join'd with &s;o much
Greatne&s;s, wou'd have conquer'd a Saint; and
that I confe&s;s'd he had the Victory over me, by
a Merit infinitely &s;uperior to the Conque&s;t he had
made.</P>
<P>He made me a mo&s;t obliging An&s;wer; told
me, abundance of fine things, which &s;till flatter'd
my Vanity, till at la&s;t I began to have Pride e|nough
to believe him, and fancy'd my&s;elf a fit
Mi&s;tre&s;s for a Prince.</P>
<P>As I had thus given the Prince the La&s;t Favour,
and he had all the Freedom with me, that it was
po&s;&s;ible for me to grant, &s;o he gave me Leave to
u&s;e as much Freedom with him, another Way,
and that was, to have every thing of him, I
thought fit to command; and yet I did not ask
of him with an Air of Avarice, as it I was
greedily making a Penny of him; but I manag'd
<PB N="78" REF="83">
him with &s;uch. Art, that he generally anticipated
my Demands he only reque&s;ted of me, that I
wou'd not think of taking another Hou&s;e, as I
had intimated to <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> that I had intend|ed,
not thinking it good enough to receive his
Vi&s;its in; but, <HI>he &s;aia,</HI> my Hou&s;e was the mo&s;t
convenient that could po&s;&s;ibly be found in all <HI>Pa|ris,</HI>
for an Amour, e&s;pecially for him having a
Way out into Three Streets, and not over|look'd
by any Neighbours, &s;o that he could pa&s;s
and repa&s;s, without Ob&s;ervation; for one of the
Back-ways open'd into a narrow dark Alley,
which Alley was a Thorow-fare, or Pa&s;&s;age, out
of one Street into another; and any Per&s;on that
went in or out by the Door, had no more to
do, but to &s;ee, that there was no-body fol|lowing
him in the Alley, before he went in at
the Door: This Reque&s;t I knew was rea&s;onable,
and therefore I a&s;&s;ur'd him, I wou'd not change
my Dwelling, &s;eeing <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> did not think it
too mean for me to receive him in.</P>
<P>He al&s;o de&s;ir'd me, that I wou'd not take any
more Servants, or let up any Equipage, at lea&s;t,
for the pre&s;ent; for that it would then be imme|diately
concluded, I had been left very Rich, and
then I &s;hou'd be throng'd with the Impertinence
of Admirers, who wou'd be attracted by the Mo|ney,
as well as by the Beauty of a young Widow,
and he &s;hou'd be frequently in$errupted in his
Vi&s;its or, that the World wou'd conclude I was
maintain'd by &s;omebody, and wou'd be inde|fatigable
to find out the Per&s;on; &s;o that he &s;hou'd
have Spies peeping at him, every rime he went out
or in, which it wou'd be impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;appoint;
and that he &s;hou'd pre&s;ently have it talk'd over
all the Toilets in <HI>Paris,</HI> that the Prince de&mdash;had
got the Jeweller's Widow &s;ot a $span$.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="84">
This was too ju&s;t to oppo&s;e; and I made no
Scruple to tell <HI>his Highne&s;s,</HI> that &s;ince he had
&s;toop'd &s;o low as to make me his own, he ought
to have all the Satisfaction in the World, that
I was all his own; that I would take all Mea|&s;ures
he &s;hould plea&s;e to direct me, to avoid the
impertinent Attacks of others; and that, if he
thought fit, I would be wholly within-Doors, and
have it given out, that I was obliged to go to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
to &s;ollicit ray Affairs there, after my Hus|band's
Misfortune and that I was not expected
there again for at lea&s;t a Year or two: This he
lik'd very well, only, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that he would by
no means have me confin'd that it would injure
my Health; and that I &s;hould then take a Coun|try-Hou&s;e
in &s;ome Village, a good-way off of the
City, where it &s;hould not be known who I was;
and that I &s;hould be there &s;ometimes, to divert
me.</P>
<P>I made no Scruple of the Confinement, and told
<HI>his Highne&s;s,</HI> no Place could be a Confinement,
where I had &s;uch a Vi&s;iter; and &s;o I put off the
Country-Hou&s;e, which would have been to re|move
my&s;elf farther from him, and have le&s;s of
his Company; &s;o I made the Hou&s;e be, as it were
&s;hut up; <HI>Amy,</HI> indeed, appear'd; and when any
of the Neighbours and Servants enquir'd, &s;he an|&s;wer'd
in broken <HI>French</HI> that I was gone to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
to look alter my Affairs; which pre&s;ently
went current thro' the Streets about us: For, you
are to note, that the People of <HI>Paris,</HI> e&s;pe|cially
the Women, are the mo&s;t bu&s;ie and im|pertinent
Enquirers into the Conduct of their
Neighbours, e&s;pccially that of a Single Woman,
that are in the World; tho' there are no
greater Intriguers in the Univer&s;e than them|&s;elves;
<PB N="80" REF="85">
and perhaps that may be the Rea&s;on of
it; for it is an old, but a &s;ure Rule; that
<Q><L>When deep Intrigues are close and &s;hy,</L>
<L>The GUILTY are the fir&s;t that &s;py.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> had the mo&s;t ea&s;ie, and yet
the most undi&s;coverable Acce&s;s to me, imaginable,
and he &s;eldom fail'd to come two or three Nights
in a Week, and &s;ometimes &s;tay'd two or three
Nights together: Once he told me, he was re|&s;olv'd
I &s;hould be weary of his Company and
that he would learn to know what it was to be a
Pri&s;oner; &s;o he gave out among his Servants, that
he was gone to&mdash;, where he often went a
Hunting, and that he &s;hould not return under a
Fortnight; and that Fortnight he &s;tay'd wholly
with me, and never went out of my Doors.</P>
<P>Never Woman, in &s;uch a Station, liv'd a Fort|night
in &s;o compleat a fullne&s;s of Humane De|light;
for to have the entire Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of
the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Princes in the World, and
of the polite&s;t, be&s;t bred Man; to conver&s;e with
him all Day, and, <HI>as he profe&s;s'd,</HI> charm him all
Night; what could be more inexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ing,
and e&s;pecially, to a Woman of a va&s;t deal' of
Pride, as I was?</P>
<P>To fini&s;h the Felicity of this Part, I mu&s;t not
forget, that the Devil had play'd a new Game with
me, and prevail'd with me to &s;atisfie my&s;elf with
this Amour, as a lawful thing; that a Prince of
&s;uch Grandeur, and Maje&s;ty; &s;o infinitely &s;upe|rior
to me, and one who had made &s;uch an Intro|duction
by an unparalell'd Bounty, I could not re|&s;i&s;t;
and therefore, that it was very Lawful for
me to do it, being at that time perfectly &s;ingle,
<PB N="81" REF="86">
and uningag'd to any other Man; as I was, mo&s;t
certainly, by the unaccountable Ab&s;ence of my
fir&s;t Husband, and the Murther of my Gentle|man,
who went for my &s;econd.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted but that I was the ea&s;ier
to per&s;wade my&s;elf of the Truth of &s;uch a, Do|ctrine
as this, when it was &s;o much for my Ea&s;e,
and for the Repo&s;e of my Mind, to have it be &s;o.</P>
<Q><L>In Things we wi&s;h, 'tis ea&s;ie to deceive;</L>
<L>What we would have, we willingly believe.</L></Q>
<P>Be&s;ides, I had no Ca&s;ui&s;ts to re&s;olve this
Doubt; the &s;ame Devil that put this into my
Head, bade me go to any of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Clergy,
and under the Pretence of Con&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;tate the
Ca&s;e exactly, and I &s;hould &s;ee they would either
re&s;olve it to be no Sin at all, or ab&s;olve me upon
the ea&s;ie&s;t Pennance: This I had a &s;trong Incli|nation
to try, but I know not what Scruple put
me off of it, for I could never bring my&s;elf to
like having to do with tho&s;e Prie&s;ts; and tho' it
was &s;trange that I, who had thus pro&s;tituted my
Cha&s;tity, and given up all Sence of Virtue, in two
&s;uch particular Ca&s;es, living a Life of open A|dultery,
&s;hould &s;cruple any thing yet &s;o it was, I
argued with my&s;elf that I could not be a Cheat
in any thing that was e&s;teem'd Sacred; that I
could not be of one Opinion, and then, pretend
my&s;elf to be of another nor could I go to Con|fe&s;&s;ion,
who knew nothing of the Manner of it,
and &s;hould betray my&s;elf to the Prie&s;t, to be a
Hugonot, and then might come into Trouble; but,
In &s;hort, tho' I was a Whore, yet I was a Prote|&s;tant
Whore, and could not act as if I was Popi&s;h,
upon any Account what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="87">
But, I &s;ay, &s;atisfy'd my&s;elf with the &s;urpriz|ing
Occa&s;ion, that, as it was all irre&s;i&s;table, &s;o it
was all lawful; for that Heaven would not &s;uffer
us to puni&s;h'd for that which it was not po&s;&s;i|ble
for us to avoid; and with the&s;e Ab&s;urdities I
kept Con&s;cience from giving me any con&s;iderable
Di&s;turbance in all this Matter; and I was as per|fectly
ea&s;ie as to the Lawfulne&s;s of it as if I had
been Marry'd to he Prince, and had no other
Husband: So po&s;&s;ible is it for us to roll our&s;elves
Up in Wickedne&s;s, till we grow invulnerable by
Con&s;cience and that Centinel once doz'd, &s;leeps
fa&s;t, not be awaken'd while the Tide of Ple&s;ure
continues to flow, or till &s;omething dark and dread|ful
brings us to our&s;elve again.</P>
<P>I have, I confe&s;s, wonder'd at the Stupidity that
my intellectual Part was under all that while;
what Lethargick Fumes doz'd the Soul; and how
it was po&s;&s;ible tlaat I, who in the Ca&s;e before,
where the Temptation was many ways more forci|ble,
and the Arguments Argument, &s;tronger and more irri|&s;i&s;table,
was yet under a continued Inquietude on
account of the wicked Life I led, could now live
in the mo&s;t profound Tranquility, and with an
uninterrupted Peace, nay, even ri&s;ing up to Satis|faction,
and Joy, and yet in a more palpable
State of Adultery $an before; for before, my
Gentleman who call'd me Wi&s;e, had the Pretence
of His Wi&s;e being parted from him, refu&s;ing to
do the. Duty of her Office as a Wife to him as
for me, my Circum&s;tances were the &s;ame; but as
for the Prince, as he had a, fine and extraordinary
Lady, or Prince&s;s, of his own; &s;o he had had
two or three Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es more be&s;ides me, and made
no Scruple of it at all.</P>
<P>However, I &s;ay, as to my own Fart, I enjoy'd
my&s;elf in perfect Tranquility: and as the Prince
<PB N="83" REF="88">
was the only Deity I wor&s;hipp'd, &s;o I was really
his Idol; and however it was with his Prince&s;s
I a&s;&s;ure you, his other Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es found a &s;enfible
Difference; and tho' they could never find me out,
yet I had good Intelligence, that they gue&s;s'd ve|ry
well, that their Lord had got &s;ome new Fa|vourite,
that robb'd them of his Company, and
perhaps, of &s;ome of his u&s;ual Bounty too: And
now I mu&s;t mention the Sacrifices he made to his
Idol, and they were not a few, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>As he lov'd like a Prince &s;o he rewarded, like a
Prince; for tho' he declin'd my making a Fi|gure,
as above, he let me &s;ee, that he was above
doing it for the &s;aving the, Expence of it, and,&s;o
he told me, and that he would make it up in o|ther
things: Fir&s;t of all, he &s;ent me a Toilet,
with all the Appurtenances of Silver, even &s;o
much as the Frame of the Table; and then, for
the Hou&s;e, he gave me the Table, or Side-board of
Plate I mention'd above, with all things belonging
to it, of ma&s;&s;y Silver; &s;o that, in &s;hort, I could
not, for my Life, &s;tudy to ask him for any thing of
Plate which I had not.</P>
<P>He could then accomodate me in nothing more
but Jewels and Cloaths, or Money for Cloaths;
he &s;ent his Gentleman to the Mercer's, and bought
me a Suit, or whole Piece, of the fine&s;t Bro|caded
Silk, figur'd with Gold, and another with
Silver, and another of Crim&s;on; &s;o that I had
three Suits of Cloaths, &s;uch as the Queen of <HI>France</HI>
would not have di&s;dain'd to have worn at that
time; yet I went out no-where but as tho&s;e
were for me to put on, when I went out of Mourn|ing,
I dre&s;s'd my&s;elf in them, one after another,
always when <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> came to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>I had no le&s;s than five &s;everal Morning Dre&s;&s;es
be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;o that I need never be &s;een twice
<PB N="84" REF="89">
in the &s;ame Dre&s;s; to the&s;e he added &s;everal Par|cels
of fine Linnen, and of Lace, &s;o much, that I
had no $oom to ask for more, or indeed, for &s;o
much.</P>
<P>I took the Liberty once, in our Freedoms, to
tell him, he was too Bountiful, and that I was too
chargeable to him for a Mi&s;tre&s;s, and that I would
be his faithful Servant, at le&s;s Expence to, him;
and that he not only left me no room to ask him
for any thing, but that he &s;upply'd me With &s;uch
a Profu&s;ion of good, things, that I &s;carce, could
wear them, or u&s;e them; unle&s;s I kept a great
Equipage, which he knew was no way conveni|ent
for him, or for me; he &s;mil'd and took me
in his Arms, and told me, he was re&s;olv'd, while
I was his, I &s;hould never be able to ask him for
any-thing; but that he-would be daily asking new
Favours of me.</P>
<P>After we were, up, for this Conference was in
Bed, he de&s;ir'd would dre&s;s me in the be&s;t Suit
of Cloaths had It was a Day or two after the
three Suits were made, and brought home; I told
him, if he pleas'd, I would rather dre&s;s me in
that Suit which I knew he lik'd belt, he ask'd
me, how I could know which he would like be&s;t,
before he had &s;een them? I told him, I would
Pre&s;ume, for once, to gue&s;s at his Fancy-by my
own; $ I went away, and dre&s;s'd me in the &s;e|cond
Suit, brocaded With Silver, and return'd in
full Dre&s;s, with a Suit of Lace upon my Head,
which; would have been worth, in <HI>England,</HI> 200 l.
Sterling; and I was every Way &s;et cut as well as
<HI>Amy</HI> could, dre&s;s me, who was a very gentile Dre&s;|&s;er
too: In this Figure I came to him, out of my
Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, which open'd with Folding-Doors
into his Bed-Chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90">
He &s;at as one a&s;toni&s;h'd, a good-while, looking

up to him, kneel'd on one Knee to him, and al|mo&s;t
whether he would or no, ki&s;s'd his Hand$
he took me up, and &s;tood up him&s;elf, but; was
&s;urpriz'd, when taking me in his Arms, he perceiv'd
Tears to run down my Cheeks; My Dear, <HI>&s;ays they</HI>
aloud, what mean the&s;e Tears? My Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI>
after some little Cheek, for I cou'd not &s;peak pre|&s;ently,

Tears of Sorrow, but Tears of Joy; it is impo&s;|&s;ible
for me to &s;ee my&s;elf &s;natch'd from the Mi&s;ery
It was fallen into, and at once to be in the Arms of
a Prince of &s;uch Goodne&s;s, &s;uch immen&s;e Boun|ty,
and be treated in &s;uch a Manner; 'tis not po&s;|&s;ible,

me with, who am &s;o infinitely below you.</P>
<P>It wou'd look a little too much like a Romance
here, to repeat all the kind things he &s;aid to me,
on that Occa&s;ion; but I can't omit one Pa&s;&s;age; as
he &s;aw the Tears drop down my Cheek, he pulls
out a fine Cambrick Hankerchief, and was going
to wipe the Tears off, but check'd his Hand, as it
he was afraid to deface &s;omething; I &s;ay, he
check'd his Hand and to&s;s'd the Handkerchief
to me, to do it my&s;elf; I took the Hint immedi|ately,
and with a kind of plea&s;ant Di&s;dam, <HI>How,
my Lord! &s;aid I, Have you ki&s;s'd me &s;o often and
don't you know whether I am Painted, or not? Pray
let your Highne&s;s &s;atisfie your&s;elf? that you have no

to &s;ay, I have not deceiv'd you with fal&s;e Colours:</HI>
With this, I put a Handkerchief into his Hand,

my Face &s;o hard, that he was unwilling to do it,
for fear of hurting me.</P>

him &s;wear, from my fir&s;t knowing him, that he
cou'd not have believ'd there was any &s;uch Skin,
without Paint, in the World; <HI>Well, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid I,
<HI>your Highne&s;s &s;hall have a farther Demon&s;tration than
this; as to that which you are pleas'd to accept for
Beauty, that it is the meer Work of Nature;</HI> and
with that, I &s;tept to the Door, and rung a little
Bell, for my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> and bade her bring
me a Cup-full of hot Water, which &s;he did; and
when it was come, I de&s;ir'd <HI>his Highne&s;s</HI> to feel
if it was warm; which he did, and I immedi|ately
wa&s;h'd my Face all over with it, before
him; this was, indeed, more than Satisfaction,
that is to &s;ay, than Believing for it was an unde|niable
Demon&s;tration, and he ki&s;s'd my Cheeks
and Brea&s;ts a thou&s;and times, with Expre&s;&s;ions of
the greatest Surprize imaginable.</P>
<P>Nor was I a very indifferent Figure as to Shape;
tho' I had had two Children by my Gentleman, and
fix by my true Husband, I &s;ay, I was no de&s;pi&s;a|ble
Shape and my Prince I mu&s;t be allow'd the
Vanity to call him &s;o) was taking his View of me as
I walk'd from one End of the Room to the other,
at la&s;t he leads me to the darke&s;t Part of the
Room, and &s;tanding behind me, bade me hold
up my Head, when putting both his Hands

Hand, that I complain'd he hurt me a little; what
he did it for, $ new not, nor had I the lea&s;t Su&s;|picion

<PB N="87" REF="92">
in half a Minute more, led me to a Peir-Gla&s;s,

Necklace of Diamonds; whereas I felt no more
what he was doing, than if he had really
done nothing at-all, nor did I &s;u&s;pect it, in

that did not fly up into my Face; Neck, and

rai&s;e the Value of it, at their own Expence; give
va&s;t Pre&s;ents for a ruinous Favour, which is &s;o

I cou'd not, in the height of all this fine doings,

<P>But I could not but &s;ometimes $ook back, with

the mo&s;t &s;candalous of our Sex, for granting them
the Liberty of abu&s;ing them&s;elves and ruining

<P>I, that knew what this Carca&s;s is of mine had been
but a few Years before; how overwhelm'd with
Grief, drown'd in Tears, frighted with the Pro&s;|pect
of Buggery' and &s;urrounded with Rags, and
Fatherle&s;s Children; that was pawning and &s;el|ling
the Rags that cover'd me, for a Dinner, and

while before, if I cou'd ha$ $ got my Bread by it.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, I cou'd not but reflect upon the Brutallity

<P>It is for this Rea&s;on, that I have &s;o largely &s;et|down
the Particulars of the Care&s;&s;es; I was treated

he defaces the Image of God in his Soul; de|thrones
his Rea&s;on; cau&s;es Con&s;cience to abdi|cate
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and exalts Sence into the va|cant

<P>O! could we hear now, the Reproaches this
Great Man afterwards loaded him&s;elf with, when
he grew weary of this admir'd Creature, and be|came
&s;ick of his Vice! how profitable would the
Report of them be to the Reader of this Story;
but had he him&s;elf al&s;o known the dirty Hi&s;tory
of my Actings upon the Stage of Life, that little
time I had been in the World, how much more
&s;evere would tho&s;e Reproaches have been upon
him&s;elf but: I &s;hall come to this again.</P>
<P>I liv'd in this gay &s;ort of Retirement almo&s;t
three Years, in which time, no Amour of &s;uch a
Kind, &s;ure, was ever carry'd up &s;o high; the
Prince knew no Bounds to his Munificence; he
cou'd give me nothing, either for my wearing or
$&s;ing, or eating, or drinking, more than he had
done from the Beginning.</P>
<P>His Pre&s;ents were, alter that, in Gold, and very
frequent, and large; often a hundred Pi&s;toles, ne|ver
le&s;s than fifty; at a time and I mu&s;t do my|&s;elf
the Ju&s;tice that I &s;eem'd rather backward to
<PB N="90" REF="95">
receive, than craving, and encroaching; not that
I had not an avaricious Temper; nor was it, that
I did not fore&s;ee that this was my Harve&s;t, in
which I was to gather up, and that it would not
la&s;t long; but it was, that really his Bounty al|ways
anticipated my Expectations, and even my
Wi&s;hes; and he gave me Money &s;o fa&s;t, that he
rather pour'd it in upon me, than left me room to
ask it; &s;o that, before I could &s;pend fifty Pi&s;toles,
I had always a hundred to make it up.</P>
<P>After I had been near a Year and a half in his
Arms, as above, or thereabouts, I prov'd with-Child;
I did not take any Notice of it to him, till
I was &s;atisfied, that I was not deceiv'd when
one Morning early, when we were in Bed toge|ther,
I &s;aid to him, My Lord, I doubt your
Highne&s;s never gives your&s;elf Leave to think,
what the Ca&s;e &s;hould be, if I &s;hould have the
Honour to be wich-Child by you: Why, my
Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we are able to keep it, it &s;uch a
thing &s;hould happen I hope you are not concern'd
about that: No my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I &s;hould think
my&s;elf very happy, if I could bring your High|ne&s;s
a Son, I &s;hould hope to &s;ee him a Lieutenant-General
of the King's Armies, by the Intere&s;t of
his Father, and by his own Merit.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, Child, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if it &s;hou'd be &s;o,
I will not refu&s;e owning him for my Son, tho' it
be, as they call it, a Natural Son; and &s;hall never
&s;light or neglect him, for the &s;ake of his Mother:
Then he began to importune me, to know if it
was &s;o but I po&s;itively denied it &s;o long, till at
la&s;t, I was able to give him the Satisfaction of
knowing it him&s;elf, by the Motion of the Child
within me.</P>
<P>He profe&s;s'd him&s;elf overjoy'd at the Di&s;cover,
bur rold me, that now it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="91" REF="96">
for me to quit the Confinement, which, he faid, I
had &s;uffer'd for his &s;ake, and to take a Hou&s;e
&s;omewhere in the Country, in order for Health,
as well as for Privacy, again&s;t my Lying-in: This
was quite out of my Way; but the Prince, who
was a Man of Plea&s;ure, had, it &s;eems, &s;everal Re|treats
of this Kind, which he had made u&s;e of,
I &s;uppo&s;e, upon like Occa&s;ions; and &s;o leaving it,
as it were, to his Gentleman, he provided a very
convenient Hou&s;e, about four Miles <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI>
at the Village of&mdash;, where I had very a|greeable
Lodgings, good Gardens, and all things
very ea&s;ie, to my Content; but one thing did
not plea&s;e me at all, <HI>viz.</HI> that an Old Woman
was provided, and put into the Hou&s;e, to furni&s;h
every thing nece&s;&s;ary to my Lying-in, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t
at my Travel.</P>
<P>I did not like this Old Woman at all; &s;he look'd
&s;o like a Spy upon me, or, (as &s;ometimes I was
frighted to imagine) like one &s;et privately to dis|patch
me out of the World, as might be&s;t &s;uit
with, the Circum&s;tance of my Lying-in; and
when his Highne&s;s came the next time to &s;ee me,
which was not many Days, I expo&s;tulated a little
on the Subject of the Old Woman; and by the
Management of my Tongue, as well as by the
Strength of rea&s;oning, I convinc'd him, that it
would not beat all convenient; that it would be
the greater Ri&s;que on his Side; and that fir&s;t, or
la&s;t, it would certainly expo&s;e him, and me al&s;o
I a&s;&s;ur'd him, that my Servant being an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Woman, never knew, to that Hour, who his High|ne&s;s
was; that I always call'd him the <HI>Count de
Clerac;</HI> and that &s;he knew nothing el&s;e of him,
nor ever &s;hould, that if he would give me leave
to choo&s;e proper Per&s;ons for my U&s;e, it &s;hou'd
be &s;o order'd, that not one of them &s;hould know
<PB N="92" REF="97">
who he was, or perhaps, ever &s;ee his Face and
that for the reallity of the Child that &s;hould be
born, his Highne&s;s, who had alone been at the
first of it, &s;hould, if he pleas'd, be pre&s;ent in the
Room all the Time; &s;o that he would need no
Witne&s;&s;es on that Account.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e fully &s;atified him, &s;o that he or
pipe der'd his Gentleman to di&s;mi&s;s the Old Woman
the &s;ame Day; and, without any Difficulty, I &s;ent
my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>Callais,</HI> and thence to <HI>Dover,</HI>
where &s;he got$an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Midwife, and an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Nur&s;e, come over, on purpo&s;e to attend an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Lady of Quality, as they &s;til'd me, for four
Months certain: The Midwife, <HI>Amy</HI> had agreed:
to pay a hundred Guineas to, and bear her Char|ges
to <HI>Paris,</HI> and back again to <HI>Dover;</HI> the poor
Woman that was to be my Nur&s;e, had twenty
Pounds, and the &s;ame Term for Charges, as the
other.</P>
<P>I was very ea&s;ie when <HI>Amy</HI> return'd, and the
more becau&s;e the brought with the Midwife, a
good Motherly &s;ort of Woman, who was to be
her A&s;&s;i&s;tant, and would be very helpful on Occa|&s;ion,
and be&s;poke a Man-Midwife at <HI>Paris</HI> too, if
there &s;hould be any Nece&s;&s;ity for his Help: Ha|ving
thus made Provi&s;ion for every thing, the
$word$, for &s;o we all call'd him in publick, came as
often to &s;ee me, as I could expect, and conti|nued
exceeding kind, as he had always been one
Day, conver&s;ing together, upon the Subject of my
being with-Child, It told him how all things were
in order; but that I had a &s;trange Apprehen&s;ion
that I &s;hould die with that Child: He $mil'd, <HI>So all
$word$ $word$ &s;ay,</HI> my Dear, &s;ays he, <HI>when they are with-Celld,</HI>
Well, however, my Lord, faid I, it is but
ju&s;t, that care &s;hould be taken, that what you
ju&s;t that care &s;hould be taken, that what you
Have be&s;tow'd in your Exce&s;s of Bounty upon
<PB N="93" REF="98">
me, &s;hould not be lo&s;t and upon this, I pull'd a
Paper out of my Bo&s;om, folded up, but not &s;eal'd,
and I read it to him: Wherein I had left Order,
that all the Plate and Jewels, and fine Furniture,
which his Highne&s;s had given me, &s;hould be re|&s;tor'd
to him by my Woman, and the Keys be
immediately deliver'd to his Gentleman, in ca&s;e of
Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>Then I recommended my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> to his
Favour for a hundred Pi&s;toles, on Condition &s;he
gave the Keys up, as above, to his Gentleman,
and his Gentleman's Receipt for them when he
&s;aw this, <HI>My Dear Child,</HI> &s;aid he, and took me in
his Arms, <HI>What have, you been making your Will,
and di&s;po&s;ing your $ffects? Pray who do you make
your univer&s;al Heir?</HI> So far as to do Ju&s;tice to your
Highne&s;s, in ca&s;e of Mortality, I have, my Lord,
<HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and who &s;hould I di&s;po&s;e the valuable
things to, which I have had from your Hand, as
Pledges of your Favour, and Te&s;timonies of your
Bounty, but to the Giver of them? If the Child
&s;hould live, your Highne&s;s will, I don't que&s;tion,
act like your&s;elf in that Part, and I &s;hall have the
utmo&s;t Satisfaction, that it will be well us'd by
your Direction.</P>
<P><HI>I con'd &s;ee he took this very well:</HI> I have for&s;a|ken
all the Ladies in <HI>Paris, &s;ays he,</HI> for you and I
have liv'd every Day &s;ince I knew you, to &s;ee that you
know how to merit all that a Man of Honour can do
for you; be ea&s;ie, Child, I hope you &s;hall not-die; and
all you have is your own, to do what with it you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I was then within about two Months of my
Time, and that &s;oon wore off when I found my
Time was come, it fell out very happily, that he
was in the Hou&s;e, and I entreated he would con|tinue
a few Hours in the Hou&s;e, which he a|greed
to; they call'd his Highne&s;s to come into
<PB N="94" REF="99">
the Room, if he pleas'd, as I had offer'd, and as
I de&s;ir'd him, and I &s;ent Word, I would make as
few Cries as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent di&s;turbing him;
he came into the Room once, and call'd to me, to
be of good Courage, it wou'd &s;oon be over, and
then he withdrew again; and in about half an
Hour more, <HI>Amy</HI> carried him the News, that I
was Deliver'd, and had brought him a charming
Boy; he gave her ten Pi&s;toles for her News,
&s;tay'd till they had adju&s;ted things about me, and
then came into the Room again, chear'd me, and
&s;poke kindly to me, and look'd on the Child, then
withdrew; and came again the next Day, to vi|&s;it
me.</P>
<P>Since this, and when I have look'd back
upon the&s;e things with Eyes unpo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with
Crime, when the wicked Part has appear'd in its
clearer Light, and I have &s;een it in its own natural
Colours; when no more blinded with the glitter|ing
Appearances, which at that time deluded me,
and, <HI>as in like Ca&s;es, if I may gue&s;s at others by my|&s;elf,</HI>
too much po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Mind; I &s;ay, &s;ince
this, I have often wonder'd, with what Plea&s;ure,
or Satisfaction, the Prince cou'd look upon the
poor innocent Infant; which, tho' his own, and
that he might: that Way have &s;ome Attachment in
his Affections to it, yet mu&s;t always afterwards
be a Remembrancer to him of his mo&s;t early
Crime and which was wor&s;e, mu&s;t bear upon it|&s;elf
unmerited, an eternal Mark of Infamy, which
&s;hould be &s;poken of upon all Occa&s;ions, to its Re|proach,
from the Folly of its Father, and Wicked|ne&s;s
of its Mother.</P>
<P>Great Men are, indeed, deliver'd from the Bur|then
of their Natural Children, or Ba&s;tards, as to
their Maintenance: This is the main Affliction
in other Ca&s;es, where there is not Sub&s;tance
<PB N="95" REF="100">
&s;uffcient, without, breaking into the Fortunes of
the Family, in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, either a Man's legi|timate
Children &s;uffer, which is very unnatural;
or the unfortunate Mother of that illegitimate Birth,
has a dreadful Affliction, either of being turn'd
off with her Child, and be left to &s;tarve, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
or of &s;eeing the poor Infant pack'd off with a
Piece, of Money, to &s;ome of tho&s;e She-Butchers,
who take Children off of their Hands, as 'tis
call'd; that is to &s;ay, &s;tarve 'em, and, in a Word,
murther 'em.</P>
<P>Great Men, I &s;ay, are deliver'd from this Bur|then,
becau&s;e they are always furni&s;h'd to &s;upply
the Expence of their Out-of-the-Way Off-&s;pring,
by making little A&s;&s;ignments upon the Bank of
<HI>Lyo$s,</HI> or the Town-Hou&s;e of <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;ettling
tho&s;e Sums, to be receiv'd for the Maintainance of
&s;uch Expence as they &s;ee Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, in the Ca&s;e of this Child of mine, while
he and I convers'd, there was no need to make any
Appointment, as an Appennage, or Maintenance
for the Child, or its Nur&s;e; for he &s;upplied me
more than &s;ufficiently for all tho&s;e things; but
afterward, when Time, and a particular Circum|&s;tance,
put an End to our conver&s;ing together; as
&s;uch things always meet with a Period, and gene|rally
break off abruptly I &s;ay, after that, I found
he appointed the Children a &s;ettled Allowance,
by an A&s;&s;ignment of annual Rent, upon the Bank
of <HI>Lyons,</HI> which was &s;u&s;&s;icient for bringing them
hand&s;omely, tho' privately, up in the World; and
that not in a Manner unworthy of their Father's
Blood, tho' I came to be &s;unk and forgotten in
the Ca&s;e; nor did the Children ever know any|thing
of their Mother, to this Day, other, than as
you may have an Account hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="101">
But to look back to the particular Ob&s;ervation I
was making, which, I hope may be of U&s;e to
tho&s;e who read my Story; I &s;ay, it was &s;omething
wonderful to me, to &s;ee this Per&s;on &s;o exceedingly
delighted at the Birth of this Child, and &s;o pleas'd
with it; for he would &s;it and look at it, and with
an Air of Seriou&s;ne&s;s &s;ometimes, a great while to|gether;
and particularly, I ob&s;erv'd, he lov'd to
look at it when it was a&s;leep.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, a lovely, charming Child, and
had a certain Vivacity in its Countenance, that
is, far from being common to all Children &s;o
young; and he would often &s;ay to me, that he be|liev'd
there was &s;omething extraordinary in the
Child, and he did not doubt but he would come
to be a Great Man.</P>
<P>I could never hear him &s;ay &s;o, but tho' &s;ecretly
it pleas'd me, yet it &s;o clo&s;ely touch'd me another
Way, that I could not refrain Sighing, and &s;ome|times
Tears; and one time, in particular, it &s;o
affected me, that I could not conceal it from him;
but when he &s;aw Tears run down my Face, there
was no concealing the Occa&s;ion from him; he
was too importunate to be deny'd, in a thing of
that Moment; &s;o I frankly an&s;wer'd, It &s;en&s;ibly
affects me, My LORD, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that whatever
the Merit of this little Creature may be, he mu&s;t
always have a Bend on his Arms; the Di&s;a&s;ter
of his Birth will be always, not a Blot only to
his Honour, but a Bar to his Fortunes in the
World; our Affection will be ever his Affli|ction,
and his Mother's Crime be the Son's Re|proach;
the Blot can never be wip'd out by the
mo&s;t glorious Actions; nay, if it lives to rai&s;e a
Family, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> the Infamy mu&s;t de&s;cend even to
its innocent Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="102">
He took the Thought, and &s;ometimes told me
afterwards, that it made a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on
him, than he di&s;cover'd to me at that time; but
for the pre&s;ent, he put it off, with telling me,
the&s;e things cou'd not be help'd; that they &s;erv'd
for a Spur to the Spirits of brave Men; in&s;pir'd
them with the Principles of Gallantry, and
prompted them to brave Actions; that tho' it
might be true, that the mention of Illegitimacy
might attend the Name, yet that Per&s;onal Virtue
plac'd a Man of Honour above the Reproach of
his Birth; that as he had no Share in the Offence, he
would have no Concern at the Blot; when having
by his own Merit plac'd him&s;elf out of the reach
of Scandal, his Fame &s;hou'd drown the Memory
of his Beginning.</P>
<P>That as it was u&s;ual for Men of Quality to make
&s;uch little E&s;capes, &s;o the Number of their Natu|ral
Children were &s;o great, and they generally
took &s;uch good Care of their Education, that
&s;ome of the greate&s;t Men in the World had a
Bend in their Coats of Arms, and that it was of
no Con&s;equence to them, e&s;pecially when their
Fame began to ri&s;e upon the Ba&s;is of their acquir'd
Merit; and upon this, he began to reckon up to
me &s;ome of the greate&s;t Families in <HI>France,</HI> and
in <HI>England</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>This carry'd off our Di&s;cour&s;e for a time; but
I went farther with him once, removing the
Di&s;cour&s;e from the Part attending our Children,
to the Reproach which tho&s;e Children would be
apt to throw upon us, their Orginals; and when
&s;peaking a little too feelingly on the Subject, he
began to receive the Impre&s;&s;ion a little deeper than
I wi&s;h'd he had done; at la&s;t he told me, I;
had almo&s;t acted the Confe&s;&s;or to him; that I
might, perhaps, preach a more dangerous Doctrine
<PB N="98" REF="103">
to him, than we &s;hou'd either of us like, or than
I was aware of; for, <HI>my Dear, &s;ays he,</HI> if once we
come to talk of Repentance, we mu&s;t talk of
parting.</P>
<P>If Tears were in my Eyes before, they flow'd
too fa&s;t now to be re&s;train'd, and I gave him but
too much Satisfaction by my Looks, that I had
yet no Reflections upon my Mind, &s;trong enough
to go that Length, and that I could no more think
of Parting, than he could.</P>
<P>He &s;aid a great many kind things, which were
Great, like him&s;elf, and extenuating our Crime,
intimated to me, that he cou'd no more part with
me, than I cou'd with him; &s;o we both, as I
may &s;ay, even again&s;t our Light, and again&s;t our
Conviction, concluded to SIN ON, indeed, his
Affection to the Child, was one great Tye to
him, for he was extremely fond of it.</P>
<P>This Child liv'd to be a con&s;iderable Man:
He was fir&s;t, an Officer of the Guard <HI>du Corps</HI> of
<HI>France;</HI> and afterwards Colonel of a Regiment of
Dragoons, in <HI>Italy;</HI> and on many extraordinary
Occa&s;ions, &s;hew'd, that he was not unworthy &s;uch
a Father, but many ways de&s;erving a legitimate
Birth, and a better Mother: Of which hereafter.</P>
<P>I think I may &s;ay now, that I liv'd indeed like
a Queen; or if you will have me confe&s;s, that my
Condition had &s;till the Reproach of <HI>a Whore,</HI> I
may &s;ay, I was &s;ure, the Queen of Whores; for
no Woman was ever more valued, or more care&s;s'd
by a Per&s;on of &s;uch Quality, only in the Station
of a Mi&s;tre&s;s; I had, indeed, one Deficiency,
which Women in &s;uch Circum&s;tances &s;eldom are
chargeable with; namely, I crav'd nothing of
him; I never ask'd him for any thing in my
Life; nor &s;uffer'd my&s;elf to be made u&s;e of, as is
too much the Cu&s;tom of Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, to ask Fa|vours
<PB N="99" REF="104">
for others; his Bounty always prevented
me in the fir&s;t, and my &s;trict concealing my&s;elf,
in the la&s;t; which was no le&s;s to my Convenience,
than his.</P>
<P>The only Favour I ever ask'd of him, was, for
his Gentleman, who he had all along intru&s;ted
with the Secret of our Affair, and who had once
&s;o much offended him, by &s;ome Omi&s;&s;ions in his
Duty, that he found it very hard to make his
Peace; he came and &s;aid his Ca&s;e before my Wo|man,
<HI>Amy,</HI> and begg'd her to &s;peak to me, to
interceed for him; which I did, and on my Ac|count,
he was receiv'd again, and pardon'd; for
which, the grateful Dog requited me, by getting
to-Bed to his Benefactre&s;s, <HI>Amy;</HI> at which I was
very angry; but <HI>Amy</HI> generou&s;ly acknowledg'd,
that it was her Fault as much as his; that &s;he
lov'd the Fellow &s;o much, that &s;he believ'd, if
he had not ask'd her, &s;he &s;hould have ask'd
him; I &s;ay, this pacify'd me, and I only obtain'd
of her, that &s;he &s;hould not let him know, that I
knew it.</P>
<P>I might have inter&s;pers'd this Part of my Story
with a great many plea&s;ant Parts, and Di&s;cour&s;e,
which happen'd between my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and I;
but I omit them, on account of my own Story,
which has been &s;o extraordinary: However, I
mu&s;t mention &s;omething, as to <HI>Amy,</HI> and her
Gentleman; I enquir'd of <HI>Amy,</HI> upon what
Terms they came to be &s;o intimate; but <HI>Amy</HI>
&s;eem'd backward to explain her&s;elf; I did not
care to pre&s;s her upon a Que&s;tion of that Na|ture,
knowing that &s;he might have an&s;wer'd my
Que&s;tion with a Que&s;tion, and have &s;aid, Why,
how did I and the Prince come to be &s;o intimate?
&s;o I left off farther inquiring into it, till after
&s;ome time, &s;he told it me all freely, of her own
<PB N="100" REF="105">
Accord, which, to cut it &s;hort, amounted to no
more than this, that <HI>like</HI> Mi&s;tre&s;s, <HI>like</HI> Maid;
as they had many lei&s;ure Hours together below,
while they waited re&s;pectively, when his Lord
and I were together above; I &s;ay, they could
hardly avoid the u&s;ual Que&s;tion one to another,
namely, Why might not they do the &s;ame thing
below, that we did above?</P>
<P>On that Account, indeed, as I &s;aid above, I
could not find in my Heart to be angry with
<HI>Amy;</HI> I was indeed, afraid the Girl would have
been with-Child too, but that did not happen,
and &s;o there was no Hurt done; for <HI>Amy</HI> had
been han&s;ell'd before, as well as her Mi&s;tre&s;s,
and by the &s;ame Party too, <HI>as you have heard.</HI></P>
<P>After I was up again, and my Child provided
with a good Nur&s;e, and withal, Winter coming
on, it was proper to think of coming to <HI>Paris</HI>
again, which I did; but as I had now a Coach
and Hor&s;es, and &s;ome Servants to attend me, by
my Lord's Allowance, I took the Liberty to have
them come to <HI>Paris</HI> &s;ometimes, and &s;o to take a
Tour into the Garden of the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> and the
other plea&s;ant Places of the City: It happened one
Day, that my Prince (if I may call him &s;o) had
a-Mind to give me &s;ome Diver&s;ion, and to take
the Air with me; but that he might do it, and
not be publickly known, he comes to me in a
Coach of the Count <HI>de</HI>&mdash;, a great Officer
of the Court, attended by his Liveries al&s;o; &s;o
that, in a word, it was impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s by the
Equipage, who I was, or who I belong'd to; al|&s;o,
that I might be the more effectually conceal'd,
he order'd me to be taken up at a Mantua-Ma|ker's
Hou&s;e, where he &s;ometimes came, whe|ther
upon other Amours, or not, was no Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of mine to enquire: I knew nothing whither
<PB N="101" REF="106">
he intended to carry me; but when be was in the
Coach, with, me, he told me, he had order'd his
Servants to go to Court with me, and he would
&s;hew me &s;ome of the <HI>Beau Monde;</HI> I told him, I
car'd not where I went, while I had the Honour to
have him with me; &s;o he carried me to the fine
Palace of <HI>Meudon,</HI> where the <HI>Dauphine</HI> then was,
and where he had &s;ome particular Intimacy with
one of the <HI>Dauphine</HI>'s Dome&s;ticks, who procur'd a
Retreat for me in his Lodgings, while we &s;tay'd
There; which was three or four Days.</P>
<P>While I was there, the KING happen'd to
come thither, from <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and making but a
&s;hort Stay, vi&s;ited Madam the <HI>Dauphine&s;s,</HI> who
was then living: The Prince was here <HI>Incognito,</HI>
only becau&s;e of his being with me; and there|fore,
when he heard, 'that the KING was in the
Gardens, he kept clo&s;e within the Lodgings; but
the Gentleman, in who&s;e Lodgings we were, with
his Lady, and &s;everal others, were out to &s;ee the
KING, and I had the Honour to be ask'd to go
with them.</P>
<P>After we had &s;een the KING, who did not
&s;tay long in the Gardens, we walk'd up the Broad
Terra&s;s, and cro&s;&s;ing the Hall, towards the Great
Stair-Ca&s;e, I had a Sight, which confounded me
at once, as, I doubt not, it wou'd have done to
any Woman in the World: The Hor&s;e-Guards,
or what they call there the <HI>Gensd' arms,</HI> had up|on
&s;ome Occa&s;ion, been either upon Duty, or been
Review'd, or &s;omething (I did not understand that
Part) was the Matter, that occa&s;ion'd their being
there, I know not what; but walking in the
Guard-Chamber, and with his Jack-Boots on, and
the whole Habit of the Troop, as it is worn,
when our Hor&s;e-Guards are upon Duty, as they
call it, at St. <HI>James</HI>'s-Park; I &s;ay, there, to my
<PB N="102" REF="107">
inexpre&s;&s;ible Confu&s;ion, I &s;aw Mr.&mdash;, my
fir&s;t Husband, the Brewer.</P>
<P>I cou'd not be deceiv'd; I pa&s;s'd &s;o near him,
that I almo&s;t bru&s;h'd him with my Cloaths, and
look'd him full in the Face, but having my Fan be|fore
my Face, &s;o that he cou'd not know me;
however, I knew him perfectly well, and I heard
him &s;peak, which was a &s;econd Way of knowing
him; be&s;ides, <HI>being, you may be &s;ure, a&s;toni&s;h'd and
&s;urpriz'd at &s;uch a Sight,</HI> I turn'd about after I had
pa&s;s'd him &s;ome Steps, and pretending to ask the
Lady that was with me, &s;ome Que&s;tions, I &s;tood
as if I had view'd the Great Hall, the outer Guard-Chamber,
and &s;ome other things; but I did it, to
take a full View of his Dre&s;s, that I might far|ther
inform my&s;elf.</P>
<P>While I &s;tood thus amu&s;ing the Lady that was
with me, with Que&s;tions, he walk'd, talking with
another Man of the &s;ame Cloth, back again, ju&s;t
by me; and to my particular Satisfaction, or Di&s;|&s;atisfaction,
take it which way you will, I heard
him &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the other being, it &s;eems, an
<HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>I then ask'd the Lady &s;ome other Que&s;tions;
Pray, Madam, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what are the&s;e Troopers,
here? are they the KING's Guards? <HI>No, &s;ays &s;he,</HI>
they are the <HI>Gensd' arms;</HI> a &s;mall Detachment of
them, I &s;uppo&s;e, attended the KING to-Day,
but they are not his Maje&s;ty's ordinary Guard;
another Lady that was with her, &s;aid, No, Ma|dam,
it &s;eems that is not the Ca&s;e; for I heard
them &s;aying, the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> were here to-Day by
&s;pecial Order, &s;ome of them being to march towards
the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the&s;e attend for Orders; but they
go back to-Morrow to <HI>Orleans,</HI> where they are ex|pected.</P>
<P>This &s;atisfied me in Pait, but I found Means
<PB N="103" REF="108">
after this, to enquire, who&s;e particular Troop it
was that the Gentlemen that were here, belong'd
to; and with that, I heard, they would all be at
<HI>Paris</HI> the Week alter.</P>
<P>Two Days after this, we return'd for <HI>Paris,</HI>
when I topk Occa&s;ion to &s;peak to my Lord, that
I heard the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> were to be in the City
the next Week, and that I &s;hould be charm'd
with &s;eeing them March, if they came in a Body:
He was &s;o obliging in &s;uch things, that I need
but ju&s;t name a thing of that Kind, and it was
done; &s;o he order'd his Gentleman (I &s;hou'd now
call him <HI>Amy's Gentleman,</HI>) to get me a Place in a
certain Hou&s;e, where I might &s;ee them March.</P>
<P>As he did not appear with me on this Occa|&s;ion,
&s;o I had the Liberty of taking my Woman,
<HI>Amy,</HI> with me; and &s;tood where we were very
well accommodated for the Ob&s;ervation which I
was to make: I told <HI>Amy</HI> what I had &s;een, and
&s;he was as forward to make the Di&s;covery, as I
was to have her, and almo&s;t as much &s;urpriz'd
at the thing it&s;elf;&s;h a Word, the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> en|ter'd
the City, as was expected, and made a mo&s;t
glorious Show indeed, being new-cloath'd and
arm'd, and being to have their Standards ble&s;s'd
by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris;</HI> on this Occa&s;ion,
they indeed, look'd very gay; and as they
march'd very lei&s;urely, I had time to take as cri|tical
a View, and make as nice a Search among
them, as I pleas'd: Here, in a particular Rank,
eminent for one mon&s;trous &s;iz'd Man on the Right;
here, I &s;ay, I &s;aw my Gentleman again, and a very
hand&s;ome jolly Fellow he was, as any in the
Troop, tho' not &s;o mon&s;trous large as that great
one I &s;peak of, who it &s;eems was however, a
Gentleman of a good Family in <HI>Ga&s;cogne,</HI> and was
call'd the <HI>Giant of Ga&s;cogne.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="109">
It was a kind of a good Fortune to us, among
the other Circum&s;tances of it, that &s;omething
caus'd the Troops to Halt in their March, a lit|tle
before that particular Rank came right-again&s;t
that Window which I &s;tood in, &s;o that then we
had Occa&s;ion to take our full View of him, at
a &s;mall Di&s;tance, and &s;o, as not to doubt of his
being the &s;ame Per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Amy,</HI> who thought &s;he might, on many Ac|counts,
venture with more Safety to be particular,
than I cou'd, ask'd her Gentleman, how a parti|cular
Man, who &s;he &s;aw there, among the <HI>Gens|d'arms,</HI>
might be enquir'd after, and found out;
&s;he having &s;een an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> riding there, which
was &s;uppos'd to be dead in <HI>England</HI> for &s;everal
Years before &s;he came out of <HI>London,</HI> and that his
Wife had marry'd again: It was a Que&s;tion the
Gentleman did not well under&s;tand how to an|&s;wer;
but another Per&s;on, that &s;tood by, told
her, if &s;he wou'd tell him the Gentleman's Name,
he wou'd endeavour to find him out for her, and
ask'd je&s;tingly, if he was her Lover? <HI>Amy</HI> put that
off with a Laugh, but &s;till continued her Enquiry,
and in &s;uch a Manner, as the Gentleman ea&s;i|ly
perceiv'd &s;he was in earne&s;t; &s;o he left ban|tering,
and ask'd her in what Part of the Troop
he rode; &s;he fooli&s;hly told him his Name, which
&s;he &s;hou'd not have done; and pointing to the
Comet that Troop carried, which was not then
quite out of Sight, &s;he let him ea&s;ily know where-abouts
he rode, only &s;he cou'd not name the Cap|tain;
however, he gave her &s;uch Directions af|terwards,
that, in &s;hort, <HI>Amy,</HI> who was an inde|fatigable
Girl, found him out, it &s;eems he had
not chang'd his Name, not &s;uppo&s;ing any Enquiry
would be made after him here; but, I &s;ay, <HI>Amy</HI>
found him out, and went boldly to his Quarters,
<PB N="105" REF="110">
ask'd for him, and he came out to her immedi|ately.</P>
<P>I believe I was not more confounded at my fir&s;t
&s;eeing him at <HI>Meudon,</HI> than he was at &s;eeing <HI>Amy;</HI>
he &s;tarted, and turn'd pale as Death; <HI>Amy</HI> be|liev'd,
if he had &s;een her at fir&s;t, in any conveni|ent
Place for &s;o villainous a Purpo&s;e, he would
have murther'd her.</P>
<P>But he &s;tarted, as I &s;ay above, and ask'd in
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with an Admiration, What are you! <HI>Sir,</HI>
&s;ays &s;he, <HI>don't you know me? Yes,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I knew

&s;uppo&s;e, for a new&punc; Tennant; but none of the

Money he had in the World, but 25 l. which
was as little as he could take with him, to &s;eek
his Fortune in the World; he cou'd not doubt
but that his Relations, &s;eeing they were all Rich,
<PB N="108" REF="113">
wou'd have taken the poor Children off, and not
let them come to the Pari&s;h; and that his Wife

that very Rea&s;on, he never wrote to her, or let
her know he was alive, that &s;he might, in a rea|&s;onable
Term of Years, marry, and perhaps, mend
her Fortunes: That he re&s;olv'd never to claim
her, becau&s;e he &s;hould rejoice to hear, that &s;he had
&s;ettled to her Mind; and that he wi&s;h'd there
had been a Law made, to empower a Woman to
marry, if her Husband was not heard of in &s;o
long time; which time, he thought, &s;hou'd not
be above four Year, which was long enough to &s;end
Word in, to a Wife or Family, from any Part of
the World.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, &s;he cou'd &s;ay nothing to that; but
this, that &s;he was &s;atisfied, her Mi&s;tre&s;s would
marry no-body, unle&s;s &s;he had certain Intelli|gence
that he had been dead, from &s;omebody that
&s;aw him buried; but alas! <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> my Mi&s;tre&s;s
was reduc'd to &s;uch di&s;mal Circum&s;tances, that
no-body wou'd be &s;o fooli&s;h to think of her, un|le&s;s
it had been &s;omebody to go a-begging with
her.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> then &s;eeing him &s;o perfectly deluded, made
a long and lamentable Outcry, how &s;he had been
deluded away, to marry a poor Footman; for
he is no wor&s;e, or better, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> tho' he calls
him&s;elf a Lord's Gentleman; and here, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI>
he has dragg'd me over into a &s;trange Country,
to make a Begger of me; and then &s;he falls a
howling again, and &s;niveling; which, by the
way, was all Hypocri&s;ie, but acted &s;o to the Life,
as perfectly deceiv'd him, and he gave entire Cre|dit
to every Word of it.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="114">
Why, <HI>Amy, &s;ays be,</HI> you are very well dre&s;s'd,
you don't look as if you were in danger of being
a Begger; <HI>Ay,</HI> hang him, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> they love to
have fine Cloaths here, if they have never a Sm&mdash;k
under them; but I love to have Money in Ca&s;h,
rather than a Che&s;t full of fine Cloaths; be&s;ides,
Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> mo&s;t of the Cloaths I have, were gi|ven
me in the la&s;t Pluce I had, when I went away
from my Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of the Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>Amy</HI> got out
of him, what Condition he was in, and how he
liv'd, upon her Promi&s;e to him, that if ever &s;he
came to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;hould &s;ee her old Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
&s;he &s;hould not let her know that he was
alive: <HI>Alas!</HI> Sir, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> I may never come to
&s;ee <HI>England</HI> again, as long as I live; and if I
&s;hou'd, it wou'd be ten Thou&s;and to One, whe|ther
I &s;hall &s;eemy old Mi&s;tre&s;s; for how &s;hou'd
I know which&punc; Way to look for her? or what
Part of <HI>England</HI> &s;he may be in; not I, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I don't
&s;o much as know how to enquire for her, and if I
&s;hou'd, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> ever be &s;o happy as to &s;ee her, I
would not do her &s;o much Mi&s;chief as to tell her
where you were, Sir, unle&s;s &s;he was in a Con|dition
to help her&s;elf and you too; This farther
deluded him, and made him entirely open in his
conver&s;ing with her: As to his own Circum|&s;tances,
he told her, &s;he &s;aw him in the highe&s;t
Preferment he had arrived to, or was ever like
to arrive to; for, having no Friends or Acquain|tance
in <HI>France,</HI> and which was wor&s;e, <HI>no Money,</HI>
he never expected to ri&s;e; that he could have
been made a Lieutenant to a Troop of Ligh-Hor&s;e
but the Week before, by the Favour of an
Officer in the <HI>Gensd'arms,</HI> who was his Friend; but
that he mu&s;t have found 8000 Livres to have
paid for it, to the Gentleman who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd it,
<PB N="110" REF="115">
and had Leave given him to &s;ell: <HI>But where cou'd
I get</HI> 8000 <HI>Livers,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that have never been Ma|&s;ter
of 500 Livres Ready-Money,</HI> at a-time, <HI>&s;ince I
came into</HI> France?</P>
<P>O Dear! <HI>Sir, &s;ays Amy,</HI> I am very &s;orry to
hear you &s;ay &s;o, I fancy if you once got up to
&s;ome Preferment, you wou'd think of my old
Mi&s;tre&s;s again, and do &s;omething for her; poor
Lady, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> &s;he wants it, to be&s;ure, and then
&s;he falls a-crying again; 'tis a &s;ad thing, indeed,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> that you &s;hould be &s;o hard put to it for
Money, when you had got a Friend to recom|mend
you, and &s;hou'd lo&s;e it for want of Money;
ay, &s;o it was, <HI>Amy,</HI> indeed, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> but what can
a Stranger do, that has neither Money or Friends?
Here <HI>Amy</HI> puts in again on my Account; well,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> my poor Mi&s;tre&s;s has had the Lo&s;s, tho'
&s;he knows nothing of it; O dear! how happy it
would have been, to be&s;ure, Sir, you wou'd have
help'd her all you cou'd; <HI>Ay,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Amy, &s;o I
wou'd,</HI> with all my Heart; <HI>and even as I am, I</HI> wou'd
&s;end her &s;ome Reliefs if I thought &s;he wanted it; only,
that then letting her know I was alive, might do her
&s;ome Prejudice, in ca&s;e of her &s;ettling, or marrying
any-body.</P>
<P>Alas! <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> Marry! who will marry her,
in the poor Condition &s;he is in? And &s;o their
Di&s;cour&s;e ended for that Time.</P>
<P>All this was meer Talk on both Sides, and
Words of Cour&s;e; for on farther Enquiry, <HI>Amy</HI>
&s;ound, that he had no &s;uch Offer of a Lieutenant's
Commi&s;&s;ion, or any thing like it; and that he
rambled in his Di&s;cour&s;e, from one thing to ano|ther:
But of that in its Place.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure, that this Di&s;cour&s;e, as <HI>Amy</HI> at
fir&s;t related it, was moving, to the la&s;t Decree,
upon me; and I was once going to have &s;ent him,
<PB N="111" REF="116">
the 8000 Livres, to purcha&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ion he
had &s;poken of; but as I knew his Character better
than any-body, I was willing to &s;earch a little
farther into it; and &s;o I &s;et <HI>Amy</HI> to enquire of
&s;ome other of the Troop, to &s;ee what Character
he had, and whether there was any-thing in the
Story of a Lieutenant's Commi&s;&s;ion, or no.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> &s;oon came to a better Under&s;tanding
of him; for &s;he pre&s;ently learnt, that he had a
mo&s;t &s;coundrel Character; that there was nothing
of Weight in any thing he &s;aid; but that he was,
in &s;hort, a meer Sharper; one that would &s;tick
at nothing to get Money, and that there was no
depending on any thing he &s;aid; and that, more
e&s;pecially, about the Lieutenant's Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;he
under&s;tood, that there was nothing at-all in it;
but they told her, how he had often made u&s;e of
<HI>that Sham,</HI> to borrow Money, and move Gentle|men
to pity him, and lend him Money, in hopes
to get him Preferment; that he had reported,
that he had a Wife, and five Children, in <HI>England,</HI>
who he maintain'd out of his Pay; and by the&s;e
Shifts had run into Debt in &s;everal Places; and
upon &s;everal Complaints for &s;uch things, he had
been threatned to be turn'd out of the <HI>Gensd'arms;</HI>
and that, in &s;hort, he was not to be believ'd in
any thing he &s;aid, or tru&s;ted on any Account.</P>
<P>Upon this Information, <HI>Amy</HI> began to cool in
her farther meddling with him; and told me, it
was not &s;afe for me to attempt doing him any
Good, unle&s;s I re&s;olv'd to put him upon Su&s;pici|ons
and Enquiries, which might be to my Ruin,
in the Condition I was now in.</P>
<P>I was &s;oon confirm'd in this Part of his Cha|racter;
for the next time that <HI>Amy</HI> came to talk
with him, he di&s;cover'd him&s;elf more effectually;
for while &s;he had put $word$ in Hopes or procuring
<PB N="112" REF="117">
One to advance the Money for the Lieutenant's
Commi&s;&s;ion for him, upon ea&s;ie Conditions, he by
Degrees, dropt the Di&s;cour&s;e, then pretended it
was too late, and that he could not get it; and
and then de&s;cended to ask poor <HI>Amy</HI> to lend him
500 Pi&s;toles.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> pretended Poverty; that her Circum|&s;tances
were but mean; and that &s;he cou'd not
rai&s;e &s;uch a Sum; and this &s;he did, to try him
to the utmo&s;t; he de&s;cended to 300, then to
100, then to 50, and then to a Pi&s;tole, which &s;he
lent him, and he never intending to pay it, play'd
out of her Sight, as much as he cou'd; and thus
being &s;atisfied that he was the &s;ame worthle&s;s
Thing he had ever been, I threw off all Thoughts
of him; whereas, had he been a Man of any
Sence, and of any Principle of Honour, I had it
in my Thoughts to retire to <HI>England</HI> again, &s;end
for him over, and have liv'd hone&s;tly with him:
But as <HI>a Fool</HI> is the wor&s;t of Husbands to do a
Woman Good, &s;o <HI>a Fool</HI> is the wor&s;t Husband a
Woman can do Good to: I wou'd willingly have
done him Good, but he was not qualified to re|ceive
it, or make the be&s;t U&s;e of it; had I &s;ent
him ten Thou&s;and Crowns, in&s;tead of eight Thou|&s;and
Livres, and &s;ent it with expre&s;s Condition,
that he &s;hould immediately have bought him&s;elf
the Commi&s;&s;ion he talk'd of, with Part of the
Money, and have &s;ent &s;ome of it to relieve the
Nece&s;&s;ities of his poor mi&s;erable Wife at <HI>London,</HI>
and to prevent his Children to be kept by the
Pari&s;h, it was evident, he wou'd have been &s;till
but a private Trooper, and his Wife and Children
ihould &s;till have &s;tarv'd at <HI>London,</HI> or been kept of
meer Charity, as, for ought he knew, they then
were.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="118">
Seeing therefore, no Remedy, I was oblig'd to
withdraw my Hand from, him, that had been my
fir&s;t De&s;troyer, and re&s;erve the A&s;&s;i&s;tance that I
intended to have given him, for another more de|&s;irable
Opportunity; all that I had now to do,
was to keep my&s;elf out of his Sight, which was
not very difficult for me to do, con&s;idering in what
Station he liv'd.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> and I had &s;everal Con&s;ultations then, up|on
the main Que&s;tion, namely, how to be &s;ure
never to chop upon him again, by Chance, and
&s;o be &s;urpriz'd into a Di&s;covery; which would
have been a fatal Di&s;covery indeed: <HI>Amy</HI> pro|pos'd,
that we &s;hou'd always take Car to know
where the <HI>Gensd$arms</HI> were quarter'd, and thereby
effectually avoid them; and this was one Way.</P>
<P>But this was not &s;o as to be fully to my Sa|tisfaction;
no ordinary Way of enquiring where
the <HI>Gensd'arms</HI> were quarter'd, were &s;ufficient to
me; but I found out a Fellow, who was compleatly
qualified for the Work of a Spy, (for <HI>France</HI> has
Plenty of &s;uch People,) this Man I employ'd
to be a con&s;tant and particular Attendant upon
his Per&s;on and Motions; and he was e&s;pe|cially
employ'd, and order'd to haunt him <HI>as a
Gho&s;t,</HI> that he &s;hould &s;carce let him be ever out
of his Sight; he perform'd this to a Nicety, and
&s;ail'd not to give me a perfect Journal of all his
Motions, from Day to Day; and whether for his
Plea&s;ures, or his Bu&s;ine&s;s, was always at his
Heels.</P>
<P>This was &s;omewhat expen&s;ive, and &s;uch a Fel|low
merited to be well paid; but he did his Bu|&s;ine&s;s
&s;o exqui&s;itely punctual, that thin poor Man
&s;carce went out of the Hou&s;e, without my know|ing
the Way he went, the Company he kept, when
he went Abroad, and when he &s;tay'd at Home.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="119">
By this extraordinary Conduct I made my&s;elf
&s;afe, and &s;o went out in publick, or &s;tay'd at-home,
as I found he was, or was not, in a Po&s;&s;i|bility
or being at <HI>Paris,</HI> at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> or any Place
I had Occa&s;ion to be at: This, tho' it was very
chargeable, yet as I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary,
&s;o I took no Thought about the Expence of it;
for I knew I cou$d not purcha&s;e my Safety too
dear.</P>
<P>By this Management I found an Opportunity
to &s;ee what a mo&s;t in&s;ignificant, unthinking Life,
the poor indolent Wretch, who by his unactive
Temper had at fir&s;t been my Ruin, now liv'd;
how he only ro&s;e in the Morning, to go to-Bed at
Night; that &s;aving the nece&s;&s;ary Motion of the
Troops, which he was oblig'd to attend, he was a
meer motionle&s;s Animal, of no Con&s;equence in
the World; that he &s;eem'd to be one, who, tho'
he was indeed, alive, had no manner of Bu&s;ine&s;s
in Life, but to &s;tay to be call'd out of it; he
neither kept any Company, minded any Sport,
play'd at any Game, or indeed, did any thing of
moment; but, <HI>in &s;hert,</HI> $word$ about, like one,
that it was net two Livres Value whether he was
dead or alive; that when he was gone, would
leave no Remembrance behind him that ever he
was here; that if ever he did any thing in the
World to be talk'd of, it was, only to get five
Beggers, and &s;tarve his Wife: The Journal of his
Life, which I had con&s;tantly &s;ent me every Week,
was the lea&s;t &s;ignificant of any-thing of its Kind,
that was ever &s;een; us it had really nothing of
Earne&s;t in it, &s;o it wou'd make no Je&s;t, to relate
it; it was not important enough, &s;o much as to
make the Reader merry withal; and for that Rea|&s;on
I omit it.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="120">
Yet this <HI>Nothing-doing Wretch$</HI> was I oblig'd to
watch and guard again&s;t, as again&s;t the only thing
that was capable of doing me Hurt in the World,
I was to &s;hun him, as we wou'd &s;hun a Spectre, or
even the Devil, if he was actually in our Way;
and it co&s;t me after the Rate of a 150 Livres a
Month, and very cheap too, to have this Crea|ture
con&s;tantly kept in View; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> my
Spy undertook, never to let him be out of his
Sight an Hour, but &s;o as that he cou'd give an Ac|count
of him; which was much the ea&s;ier for be
done, con&s;idering his Way or Living; for he was
&s;ure, that for whole Weeks together, he wou'd be
ten Hours of the Day, half a&s;leep on a Bench at
the Tavern-Door where he quarter'd, or drunk
within the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho' this wicked Life he led, &s;ometimes mov'd
me to pity him, and to wonder &s;how &s;o well-bred,
Gentlemanly a Man as he once was, could degene|rate
into &s;uch a u&s;ele&s;s thing, as he now appear'd;
yet, at the &s;ame time, it gave me mo&s;t con|temptible
Thoughts o$ him, an made me often
&s;ay, I was a Warning for all the Ladies of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
again&s;t maryiag of FOOLS; a Man of Sence
falls in the World, and gets-up again, and a Wo|man
has &s;ome Chance for her&s;elf; but with a
FOOL! once fall, and ever undone; once in the
Ditch, and die in the Ditch; once poor, and &s;ure
to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>But 'tis time to have done with him, once I
had nothing to hope for, but to &s;ee him again;
now my only Felicity was, it po&s;&s;ible, never to
&s;ee him, and, above all, to keep him from &s;ee|ing
me; which, as above, I took effectual Care
of.</P>
<P>I was now return'd to <HI>Paris;</HI> my little <HI>Son of
Honour;</HI> as I call'd him, was left at&mdash;, where
<PB N="116" REF="121">
my la&s;t Country Seat then was, and I came to
<HI>Paris,</HI> at the Prince's Reque&s;t; thither he came to
me as &s;oon as I arriv'd, and told me, he came to
give me Joy of my Return, and to make his Ac|knowledgments,
for that I had given him a SON: I
Thought indeed, he had been going to give me
a Pre&s;ent, and &s;o he did the next Day, but in
what he &s;aid then, he only je&s;ted with me: He
gave me his Company all the Evening; Supp'd
with me about Midnight, and did me the Honour,
as I then call'd it, to lodge me in his Arms all the
Night, telling me, in je&s;t, that the be&s;t Thanks for
a son born, was giving the Pledge for another.</P>
<P>But as I hinted, &s;o it was, the next Morning he
laid me down, on my Toilet, a Pur&s;e with 300
Pi&s;toles: I &s;aw him &s;ay it down, and understood
what he meant, but I took no Notice of it, till I
came to it (as it were) ca&s;ually; then I gave a
great Cry-out, and fell a-&s;colding in my Way, for
he gave me all po&s;&s;ible Freedom of Speech, on
&s;uch Occa&s;ions: I told him, he was unkind;
that he would never give me an Opportunity to
ask him for any thing; and that he forc'd me
to Blu&s;h, by being too much oblig'd, <HI>and the like;</HI>
all which I knew was very agreeable to him; for
as he was Bountiful, beyond Mea&s;ure, &s;o he was
infinitely oblig'd by my being &s;o backward to ask
any Favours; and I was even with him, for I
never ask'd him for a Fathing in my Life.</P>
<P>Upon this rallying him, he told me, I had ei|ther
perfectly &s;tudied the Art of Humour, or el&s;e,
what was the greate&s;t Difficulty to others, was
Natural to me; adding, That nothing cou'd be
more obliging to a Man of Honour, than not to
be &s;olliciting and craving.</P>
<P>I told him, nothing cou'd be craving upon him;
that he left no room for it, that I hop'd he did
<PB N="117" REF="122">
not give, meerly to avoid the Trouble of being
importun'd; I told him, he might depend upon
it, that I &s;hould be reduc'd very low indeed, be|fore
I offer'd to di&s;turb him that Way.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, a Man of Honour ought always to
know what he ought to do; and as he did no|thing
but what he knew was rea&s;onable, he gave
me Leave to be free with him, if I wanted any
thing; that he had too much Value for me, to
deny me any thing, if I ask'd; but that it was
infinitely agreeable to him to hear me &s;ay, that
what he did, was to my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>We &s;train'd Compliments thus a groat while, and
as he had me in his Arms mo&s;t Part of the Time, &s;o
upon all my Expre&s;&s;ions of his Bounty to me, he
put a Stop to me with his Ki&s;&s;es, and wou'd ad|mit
me to go on no farther.</P>
<P>I &s;hould in this Place mention, that this Prince
was not a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> tho' at that Time he
re&s;ided at <HI>Paris,</HI> and was much at Court, where, I
&s;uppo&s;e, he had or expected &s;ome con&s;iderable Em|ployment:
But I mention at on this Account; that
a few Days after this, he came to me, and told me,
he was come to bring, me not the mo&s;t welcome
News that ever I heard from him in his Life;
I look'd at him, a little &s;urpriz'd; but he return'd,
Do not be unea&s;ie, it is as unplea&s;ant to me, as to
you, but I come to con&s;ult with you about it, and
&s;ee, if it cannot be made a little ea&s;ie to us both.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd &s;till more concern'd, and &s;urpriz'd;
at la&s;t he &s;aid, it was, that he believ'd he &s;hould
be oblig'd to go into <HI>Italy;</HI> which tho' otherwi&s;e
it was very agreeable to him, yet his parting with
me, made it a very dull thing but to think of.</P>
<P>I &s;at mute, as one Thunder-&s;truck, for a good-while;
and it pre&s;antly occur'd to me, that I was
going to lo&s;e him, which, indeed, I cou'd but ill
<PB N="118" REF="123">
bear the Thoughts of; and as he told me, I turn'd
pale: What's the Matter? <HI>&s;aid he, ha&s;tily;</HI> I have
&s;urpriz'd you, indeed; and &s;tepping no the Si$e-Board,
fills a Dram o$ Cordial-Water, (which was
of his own bringing) and comes to me, Be not
&s;urprizd, <HI>&s;aid be,</HI> I'll go no-where without you;
adding &s;everal other things &s;o kind, as nothing
could exceed it.</P>
<P>I might, indeed, turn pale, for I was very much
&s;urpriz'd at fir&s;t, believing that this was, as it of|ten
happens in &s;uch Ca&s;es, only a Project to drop
me, and break off an Amour, which he had now
carried on &s;o long; and a thou&s;and Thoughts
whirl'd about my Head in the few Moments while
I was kept in &s;u&s;pence; (for they were but a few)
I &s;ay, I was indeed, &s;urpriz'd, and might, per|haps,
look pale; but I was not in any Danger of
Fainting, that I knew of.</P>
<P>However, it not n little pleas'd me, to &s;ee
him &s;o concern'd and anxious about me; but I
&s;topp'd a little, when he put the Cordial to my
Mouth, and taking the Glats in Hand, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI>
My Lord, your Words are in&s;initely more of a
Cordial to me, than this Citron; for as nothing
can be a greater Affliction, than to lo&s;e you, &s;oo
nothing can be a greater Satisfaction than the A&s;|&s;urance,
that I &s;hall not ha$$ that Misfortune.</P>
<P>He made me &s;it down, and &s;at down by me, and
after &s;aying a thou&s;and kind things to me; he turns
upon me, with a Smile, Why, will you venture
your'd to <HI>Italy</HI> with me? <HI>&s;ays $e;</HI> I &s;topp'd a-while,
and then an&s;wer'd, that I wonder'd the would ask
me that Que&s;tion; for I would go any-where in the
World, or all over the World, wherever he &s;hou$d

Then he enter'd into a long Account of the
Occa&s;ion of his Journey, and how the King
had Engag'd him to go, and &s;ome other Cir|cum&s;tances,
which are not proper to enter into
here; it being by no means proper to &s;ay any|thing,
that might lead the Reader into the lea&s;t
Gue&s;s at the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>But to cut &s;hort this Part of the Story, and the
Hi&s;tory of our Journey, and Stay abroad, which
would almo&s;t fill up a Volume of it&s;elf, I &s;ay, we
&s;pent all that Evening in chear ul Con&s;ultations a|bout
the Manner of our Travelling; the Equi|page
and Figure lie &s;hou'd go in; and in what
Manner I &s;hou'd go: Several Ways were propos'd,
but none &s;eem d &s;$a&s;ible till, at la&s;t, I told him,
I thought it wou'd be &s;o trouble&s;ome, &s;o expen|&s;ive,
and &s;o publick, that it wou'd be many
Ways inconvenient to him; and tho' it was a
kind of Death to me, to lo&s;e him, yet that ra|ther
than &s;o very much perplex his Affairs, I
wou'd &s;ubmit to any-thing.</P>
<P>At the next Vi&s;it I fill'd his Head with the
&s;ame Difficulties, and then, at la&s;t, came over
him with a Propo&s;al, that I wou'd &s;tay in <HI>Paris,</HI>
or where el&s;e he &s;hou'd direct; and when I heard
of his &s;a$e Arrival, wou$d come away by my&s;elf,
and place my&s;elf as near him as I cou'd.</P>
<P>This gave him no Satisfaction at all; nor wou'd
he hear any more of it; but if I dur&s;t venture
my&s;elf, as be call'd it, &s;uch a Journey, he wou'd
not lo&s;e the Satisfaction of my Company; and as
for the Expence, that was not to be nam'd, nei|ther,
indeed, was there room to name it; for I
found, that he travell$ d at the KING's Expence,
as well for him&s;elf, as for all his Equipage; being
upon a Piece of &s;ecret Service of the la&s;t Impor|tance.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="125">
But after &s;everal Debates between our&s;elves, he
came to this Re&s;ulution, <HI>viz.</HI> that he wou'd tra|vel
<HI>Incognito,</HI> and &s;o he &s;hon'd avoid all publick
Notice, either of him&s;elf, or of who went with
him; and that then he &s;hou'd not only carry me
with him, but have a perfect Lei&s;ure of enjoying
my agreeable Company, (<HI>as he was pleas'd to call it</HI>)
all the Way.</P>
<P>This was &s;o obliging, that nothing cou'd be
more;&s;o upon this Foot, he immediately &s;et to
Work to prepare things for his Journey; and by
his Directions, &s;o did I too: But now I had a
terrible Difficulty upon me, and which way to get
over it, I knew not; and that was, in what Man|ner
to take Care of what I had to leave behind
me; I was Rich, as I have &s;aid, very Rich, and
what to do with it, I knew not, nor who to leave
in Tru&s;t, I knew nor; I had no-body but <HI>Amy,</HI>
in the World, and to travel without <HI>Amy,</HI> was
very uncomfortable; or to leave all I had in the
World with her, and if &s;he mi&s;carried, be ruin'd
at once, was &s;till a frightful Thought; for <HI>Amy</HI>
might die, and who&s;e Hands things might fall
into, I knew not: This gave me great Unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
and I knew not what to do; for I could not
mention it to the Prince, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;ee that I
was richer than he thought I was.</P>
<P>But the Prince made all this ea&s;ie to me; for in
concerning Mea&s;ures for our Journey, he &s;tarted the
thing him&s;elf, and ask'd me merrily one Evening,
who I wou'd tru&s;t with all my Wealth, in my
Ab&s;ence?</P>
<P>My Wealth, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> except what I
owe to your Goodne&s;s, is but &s;mall; but yet,
that little I have, I confe&s;s, cau&s;es &s;ome Thought|fulne&s;s;
becau&s;e I have no Acquaintance in <HI>Paris,</HI>
that I $$re tru&s;t with it, nor any-body but my
<PB N="121" REF="126">
Woman, to leave in the Hou&s;e, and how to do
without her upon the Road, I do not well know.</P>
<P>As to the Road, be not concern'd, <HI>&s;ays the Prinoc,</HI>
I'll provide you Servants to your Mind; and as
for your Woman, if you can tru&s;t her, leave her
here, and I'll put you in a Way how to &s;ecure
things, as well as if you were at Home: I bow'd,
and told him, I cou'd not be put into better hands
than his own, and that therefore, I wou'd govern
all my Mea&s;ures by his Directions; &s;o we talk'd
no more of it that Night.</P>
<P>The next Day he &s;ent me in a great Iron Che&s;t,
&s;o large, that it was as much as &s;ix lu&s;ty Fel|lows
could get up the Steps, into the Hou&s;e; and
in this I put, indeed, all my Wealth; and for my
Safety, he order'd a good hone&s;t ancient Man
and his Wife, to be in the Hou&s;e with her, to
keep her Company, and a Maid-Servant, and
Boy; &s;o that there was a good Family, and <HI>Amy</HI>
was Madam, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Things being thus &s;ecur'd, we &s;et out <HI>Incog&punc;</HI> as
he call'd it; but we had two Coaches and Six
Hor&s;es; two Chai&s;es; and about eight Men-Ser|vants
on Hor&s;eback, all very well Arm'd.</P>
<P>Never was Woman better us'd in this World,
that went upon no other Account than I did; I
had three Women-Servants to wait on me, one
whereof was an old Madam&mdash;, who thorow|ly
understood her Bu&s;ine&s;s, and manag'd every
thing, as if &s;he had been <HI>Major Domo;</HI> &s;o I had
no Trouble; they had one Coach to them&s;elves,
and the Prince and I in the other; only that
&s;ometimes, where he knew it nece&s;&s;ary, I went
into their Coach; and one particular Gentleman
of the Retinue rode with him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall $ay no more of the Journey, than that
when we came to tho&s;e frightful Mountains, the
<PB N="122" REF="127">
<HI>Alps;</HI> there was no travelling in our Coaches, &s;o
he order'd a Hor&s;e-Litter, but carried by Mules,
to be provided for me, and him&s;elf went on
Hor&s;eback; the Coaches went &s;ome other Way
back to <HI>Lyons;</HI> then we had Coaches hir'd at <HI>Turin,</HI>
which met us at <HI>Su&s;a;</HI> &s;o that we were accommo|dated
again, and went by ea&s;ie Journeys afterwards,
to <HI>Rome,</HI> where his Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>whatever it was,</HI> call'd
him to &s;tay &s;ome time; and from thence to <HI>Ve|nice.</HI></P>
<P>He was as good as his Word, indeed; for I
had the Plea&s;ure of his Company, and in a word,
engro&s;s'd his Conver&s;ation almo&s;t all the Way:
He took Delight in &s;howing me every thing that
was to be &s;een, and particularly, in telling me
&s;omething of the Hi&s;tory of every thing he &s;how d$
me.</P>
<P>What valuable Pains were here thrown away up|One,
who he was &s;ure, at la&s;t, to abandon w$th
Regret! How below him&s;elf, did a Man of Qua|lity,
and of a thou&s;and Accompli&s;hments, behave
in all this! Tis one of my Rea&s;ons for entring in|to
this Part, which otherwi&s;e wou'd not be worth
relating: Had I been a Daughter, or a Wife, of
whom it might be &s;aid, that he had a ju&s;t Con|cern
in their In&s;truction, or Improvement, it had
been an admirable Step; but all this to a Whore!
to one who he carried with him upon no Account,
that could be rationally agreeable; and none but
to gratifie the meane&s;t of humane Frailties: This
was the Wonder of it.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the Power of a vicious Inclination;
Whoring was, in a Word, his Darling Crime; the
wor&s;t Excur&s;ion he made; for he was otherwi&s;e,
one of the mo&s;t excellent Per&s;ons in the World;
no Pa&s;&s;ions; no furious Excur&s;ions; no oftentati|ous
Pride; the mo&s;t humble, courteous, affable

Per&s;on in the World; not an Oath; not an inde|cent
Word, or the lea&s;t Blemi&s;h in Behaviour,
was to be &s;een in all his Conversation, except as
before excepted; and it has given me Occa&s;ion
for many dark Renections &s;ince; to look back
and think, that I &s;hould be the Snare of &s;uch a
Per&s;on's I $e; that I &s;hould influence him to &s;o
much Wickedne&s;s; and that I &s;hould be the in|&s;trument
in the Hand of the Devil, to do him &s;o
much Prejudice.</P>
<P>We were near two Year upon this <HI>Grand Tour,</HI>
as it may be call'd, during mo&s;t or which, I re&s;i|ded
at <HI>Rome,</HI> or at <HI>Venice,</HI> having only been twice
at <HI>Florence,</HI> and once at <HI>Naples:</HI> I made &s;ome very
diverting and u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations in all the&s;e Places;
and particularly, o the Con$uct of the Ladies;
for I had Opportunity to conver&s;e very much a|mong
them, by the Help of the old Witch that
travell'd with us; &s;he had been at <HI>Naples,</HI> and at
<HI>Venice,</HI> and had liv'd in the former,
&s;everal Years,
where, as I found, &s;he had liv'd but a loo&s;e Life,
as indeed, the Women of <HI>Naples</HI> generally do;
and, in &s;hort, I found &s;he was fully acquainted
with all the intrieguing Arts of that Part or the
World.</P>
<P>Here my Lord bought me a little Female <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Slave, who being Taken at Sea by a <HI>Malthe&s;e</HI> Man
of War, was in brought there; and of her I learnt
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language; their Way of Dre&s;&s;ing,
and Dancing, and &s;ome <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> or rather <HI>Moori&s;h</HI>
Songs, of which I made U$e, to my Advantage,
on an extraordinary Occa&s;ion, &s;ome Years after, as
you &s;hall hear in its Place. I need not &s;ay I learnt
<HI>Italian</HI> too, for I got pretty well Mi&s;tre&s;s of that,
before I had been there a Year; and as I had Lei|&s;ure
enough, and lov'd the Language, I read all the
<HI>Italian</HI> Books I cou'd come at.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="129">
I began to be &s;o in Love with <HI>Italy,</HI> especially with
<HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> that I cou'd have been very
well &s;atisfied to have &s;ent for <HI>Amy,</HI> and have taken
up my Re&s;idence there for Life.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Rome,</HI> I did not like it at-all: The Swarms
of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of all Kinds, on one &s;ide, and
the &s;coundre$ Babbles of the Common People, on
the other, make <HI>Rome</HI> the unplea&s;ante&s;t Place in
the World, to live in; the innumerable Number
of Valets, Lacqueys, and other Servants, is &s;uch,
that they us'd to &s;ay, that there are very few of
the Common People in <HI>Rome,</HI> but what have been
Footmen, or Porters, or Grooms to Cardinals, or
Foreign Amba&s;&s;adors: In a Word, they have an
Air of &s;harping and couzening, quarrelling and
&s;colding, upon their general Behaviour; and when
I was there, the Footmen made &s;uch a Broil be|tween
two Great Families in <HI>Rome,</HI> about which
of their Coaches (the Ladies being in the Coaches
on either &s;ide,) &s;hou'd give Way to t'other; that
there was above thirty People wounded on both
Sides; five or &s;ix kill'd outright; and both the
Ladies frighted almo&s;t to Death.</P>
<P>But I have no-Mind to write the Hi&s;tory of my
Travels on this &s;ide of the World, at lea&s;t, not
Now; it would be too full of Variety.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, omit, that the Prince
continued in all this Journey, the mo&s;t kind, obli|ging
Per&s;on to me, in the World, and &s;o con&s;tant,
that tho' we were in a Country, where 'tis well
known all manner of Liberties are taken, I am yet
well a&s;&s;ur'd, he neither took the Liberty he knew
he might have, or &s;o much as de&s;ir'd it.</P>
<P>I have often thought of this Noble Per&s;on, on
that Account; had he been but half &s;o true, to
faithful, and con&s;tant to the Be&s;t Lady in the
World, I mean his Prince&s;s; how glorious a Vir|tue
<PB N="125" REF="130">
had it been in him? and how free had he been
from tho&s;e ju&s;t Reflections which touch'd him, in
her behalf, when it was too late.</P>
<P>We had &s;ome very agreeable Conver&s;ations up|on
this Subject; and once he told me, with a
kind of more than ordinary Concern upon his
Thoughts, that he was greatly beholden to me for
taking this hazardous and difficult Journey; for
that I had kept him Hone&s;t; I look'd up in his
Face, and colour'd as red as Fire: Well, well, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> do not let that &s;urprize you; I do &s;ay, you
have kept me Hone&s;t: My Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> 'tis not
for me to explain your Words, but I with I cou'd
turn 'em my own Way; I hope, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and be|lieve,
we are both as Hone&s;t as we can be, in our
Circum&s;tances; ay, ay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and hone&s;ter than
I doubt I &s;hou'd have been, if you had not been
with me; I cannot &s;ay but it you had not been
here, I &s;hou'd have wander'd among the gay
World here, in <HI>Naples,</HI> and in <HI>Venice</HI> too;
for 'tis not &s;uch a Crime here, as 'tis in other
Places; but I prote&s;t, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I have not touch'd a
Woman in <HI>Italy,</HI> but your&s;elf; and more than
that, I have not &s;o touch as had any De&s;ire to it;
&s;o that, I &s;ay, you have kept me Hone&s;t.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent, and was glad that he interrupted
me, or kept me from &s;peaking, with ki&s;&s;ing me,
for really I knew not what to &s;ay: I was once go|ing
to &s;ay that if his Lady, the Prince&s;s, had
been with him, &s;he wou'd, doubtle&s;s, have had
the &s;ame Influence upon his Virtue, with infinitely
more Advantage to him; but I con&s;ider'd this
might give him Offence; and be&s;ides, &s;uch things
might have been dangerous to the Circum&s;tance
I &s;tood in, &s;o it pa&s;s'd off: But I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
I &s;aw that he was quite another Man, as to Wo|men,
than I under&s;tood he had always been be|fore;
<PB N="126" REF="131">
and it was a particular Satisfaction to me,
that I was thereby convinc'd that what he &s;aid,
was true, and that he was, as I may &s;ay, <HI>all my Own.</HI></P>
<P>I was with-Child again in this Journey, and
Lay-in at <HI>Venice,</HI> but was not &s;o happy as before;
I brought him another Son, and a very fine Boy
it was, but it liv$ d not above two Months; nor,
after the fir&s;t Touches of Affection (which are u|&s;ual,
I believe, to all Mothers) were over, was I
&s;orry the Child did not live, the nece&s;&s;ary Diffi|culties
attending it in our travelling, being con&s;i|der$d.</P>
<P>After the&s;e &s;everal Perambulations, my Lord
told me, his Bu&s;ine&s;s began to clo&s;e, and we wou$d
think of returning to <HI>France;</HI> which I was very glad
of, but principally on Account of my Trea&s;ure
I had there, which, as you have heard, was very
con&s;iderable: It is true, I had I e$$ers very fre|quently
from my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> with Accounts, that
every thing was very &s;afe, and that was very much
to my Satisfaction: flowever, as the Prince's Ne|gociations
were at an End, and he was oblig'd to
return, I was very glad to go; &s;o we return'd from
<HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Turin;</HI> and in the Way, I &s;aw the fa|mous
City of <HI>M$lan;</HI> from <HI>Turin,</HI> we went over the
Mountains again, as before, and our Coaches met
us at <HI>Pont a v$sia,</HI> between <HI>C$amberry</HI> and <HI>Lyons;</HI>
and &s;o, by ca$$e Journeys, we arriv'd &s;afely at
<HI>Paris,</HI> having been ab&s;ent about two Years, want|ing
about eleven Days, as above.</P>
<P>I found the little family we left, ju&s;t as we left
them; and <HI>Amy</HI> cry'd for Joy, when the &s;aw me,
and I almost did the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Prince took his Leave of me the Night be|fore;
for as he told me, he knew he &s;hou'd
be met upon the Road by &s;everal Per&s;ons of Qua|lity,
and perhaps, by the Prince&s;s her&s;elf;&s;o we
<PB N="127" REF="132">
lay at two different Inns that Night, le&s;t &s;ome
&s;hou'd come quite to the Place, as indeed, it hap|pen'd.</P>
<P>After this, I &s;aw him not, for above twenty
Days, being taken-up in his Family, and al&s;o with
Bu&s;ine&s;s; but he &s;ent me his Gentleman, to tell
me the Rea&s;on of it; and bid me not be unea&s;ie;
and that &s;atisfied me effectually.</P>
<P>In all this Affluence of my good Fortune, I did
not forget that I had been Rich and Poor once al|ready,
alternately; and that I ought to know,
that the Circum&s;tances I was now in, were not to
be expected to la&s;t always; that I had one Child,
and expected another; and if I bred often, it
wou'd &s;omething impair me in the Great Article
that &s;upported my Intere&s;t, I mean, what he call'd
Beauty; that as that declin'd, I might expect the
Fire won'd abate, and the Warmth with which
I was now &s;o carre&s;s'd, wou'd cool, and in time,
like the other Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of Great Men, I might
be dropt again; and that, therefore, it was my
Bu&s;ine&s;s to take Care that I &s;hou'd fall as &s;oftly as
I cou'd.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, I did not forget, therefore, to make as
good Provi&s;ion for my&s;elf, as if I had had nothing
to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on, but what I now gain'd:
whereas I had not le&s;s than ten Thou&s;and Pounds,
as I &s;aid above, which I had ama&s;s'd, or &s;ecur'd,
rather out of the Ruins of my faithful Friend,
the Jeweller; and which, he little thinking of what
was &s;o near him when he went out, told me, tho'
in a kind of a Je&s;t, was all my own, if he was
knock'd o'th' Head; and which, upon that Title,
I took Care to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>My greate&s;t Difficulty now, was, how to &s;ecure
my Wealth, and to keep what I had got; for I
had greatly added to this Wealth, by the gene|rous
<PB N="128" REF="133">
Bounty of the Prince&mdash;, and the more,
by the private retired Manner of Living, which he
rather de&s;ir'd for Privacy, than Par&s;imony; for
he &s;upply'd me for a more magnificent Way of
Life than I de&s;ir'd, if it had been proper.</P>
<P>I &s;hall cut &s;hort the Hi&s;tory of this pro&s;perous
Wickedne&s;s, with telling you I brought him a
third Son, within little more than eleven Months
after our Return from <HI>Italy;</HI> that now I liv'd a
little more openly, and went by a particular Name
which he gave me Abroad; but which I mu&s;t o|mit
<HI>viz.</HI> the Counte&s;s <HI>de</HI>&mdash;, and had Coaches,
and Servants, &s;uitable to the Quality he had gi|ven
me the Appearance of; and which is more
than u&s;ually happens in &s;uch Ca&s;es, this held
eight Years from the Beginning; during which
Time, as I had been very faithful to him, &s;o, I
mu&s;t &s;ay, as above, that I believe he was &s;o &s;epa|rated
to me, that whereas he u&s;ually had two or
three Women, which he kept privately, he had
not in all that Time meddled with any of them,
but that I had &s;o perfectly engro&s;s'd him, that he
dropt them all; not, perhaps, that he &s;av'd much
by it, for I was a very chargable Mi&s;tre&s;s to him,
that I mu&s;t acknowlege; but it was all owing to
his particular Affection to me, not to my Extra|vagance;
for, as I &s;aid, he never gave me leave
to ask him for any thing, but pour'd in his
Favours and Pre&s;ents fa&s;ter than I expected, and
&s;o fa&s;t, as I could not have the A&s;&s;urance to make
the lea&s;t Mention of de&s;iring more.</P>
<P>Nor do I &s;peak this of my own Gue&s;s, I mean,
about his Con&s;tancy to me, and his quirting all
other Women; but the old <HI>Harradan,</HI> as I may
call her, who he made the Guide of our Travel|ling,
and who was a &s;trange old Creature, told me
a Thou&s;and Stories of his Gallantry, as &s;he call'd
<PB N="129" REF="134">
it, and how, as he had no le&s;s than three Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
at one time, and, as I found, all of her procuring,
he had of a &s;udden, dropt them all, and that he
was entirely lo&s;t to both her and them;that they
did believe he had fallen into &s;ome new Hands,
but &s;he could never hear who, or where, till he
&s;ent for her to go this Journey; and then the old
Hag complimented me upon his Choice, That &s;he
did not wonder I had &s;o engro&s;s'd him;&s;o much
Beauty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I found by her, what was, you
may be &s;ure, to my particular Satisfaction, <HI>viz.</HI>
that, as above, I had him all my own.</P>
<P>but the highe&s;t Tide has its Ebb; and in all
things of this Kind, there is a Reflux which
&s;ometimes al&s;o is more impetuou&s;ly violent than
the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;ion: My Prince was a Man of a
va&s;t Fortune, tho' no Sovereign, and therefore
there was no Probability that the Expence of
keeping a Mi&s;tre&s;s could be injurious to him, as
to his E&s;tate; he had al&s;o &s;everal Employments,
both out of <HI>France,</HI> as well as in it;For, as above,
I &s;ay, he was not a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> tho' he liv'd
in that Court: He had a Prince&s;s, a Wife, with
whom ho had liv'd &s;everal Years, and a Woman
(<HI>&s;o the Voice of Fame reported</HI>) the mo&s;t valuable
of her Sex; of Birth equal to him, if not &s;upe|riour,
and of Fortune proportionable; but in
Beauty, Wit, and a thou&s;and good Qualities, &s;u|periour
not to mo&s;t Women, but even to all her
Sex;and as to her Virtue, the Character, which
was mo&s;t ju&s;tly her due, was that of, not only the
be&s;t of Prince&s;&s;es, but even the be&s;t of Women.</P>
<P>They liv'd in the utmo&s;t Harmony, as with
&s;uch a Prince&s;s it was impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e;
but yet the Prince&s;s was not in&s;en&s;ible that her
Lord had his <HI>Foible&s;s;</HI> that he did make &s;ome Ex|cur&s;ions;
<PB N="130" REF="135">
and particularly, that he had one Fa|ourite
Mi&s;tre&s;s which &s;ometimes engro&s;s'd him
more than &s;he (the Prince&s;s) cou'd wi&s;h, or be
ea&s;ily &s;atisfied with: However, &s;he was &s;o good,
&s;o generous, &s;o truly kind a Wife, that &s;he never
gave him any Unea&s;ine&s;s on this Account; except
&s;o much as mu&s;t ari&s;e from his Sence of her
bearing the Affront of it with &s;uch Patience, and
&s;uch a profound Re&s;pect for him, as was in it&s;elf
enough to have reform'd him, and did &s;ometimes
&s;hock his generous Mind, &s;o as to keep him at
Home, as I may call it, a great-while together;
and it was not long before I not only perceiv'd it
by his Ab&s;ence, but really got a Knowledge of
the Rea&s;on of it, and once or twice he even ac|knowledged
it to me.</P>
<P>It was a Point that lay not in me to manage;
I made a kind of Motion, once or twice, to him,
to leave me, and keep him&s;elf to her, as he ought
by the Laws and Rites of Matrimony to do, and
argued the Genero&s;ity of the Prince&s;s to him, to
per&s;wade him;but I was a Hypocrite;for had I
preva$$'d with him really to be hone&s;t, I had lo&s;t
him, which I could not bear the Thoughts of;
and he might ea&s;ily &s;ee I was not in earne&s;t;
one time in particular, when I took upon me to
talk at this rate, I found when I argued &s;o much
for the Virtue and Honour, the Birth, and above
all, the generous U&s;age he found in the Per&s;on of
the Prince&s;s, with re&s;pect to his private Amours,
and how it &s;hould prevail upon him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I found
it began to affect him, and he return'd, <HI>And do
you indeed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>per&s;wade me to leave you? Would
you have me think you &s;incere?</HI> I look'd up in his
Face, &s;$$$ng, <HI>Not for any other Favourite,</HI> my
$word$, &s;aid I; <HI>that wou'd break my Heart;</HI> but <HI>for
Mad$$n the Prince&s;s!</HI> &s;aid I, and then I could &s;ay no
<PB N="131" REF="136">
more, Tears follow'd, and I &s;at &s;ilent a-while: Well,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> if ever I do leave you, it &s;hall be on the
Virtuous Account; it &s;hall be for the Prince&s;s, I
a&s;&s;ure you it &s;hall be for no other Woman; <HI>That's
enough, my Lord,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>There I ought to &s;ubmit; and
while I am a&s;&s;ur'd it &s;hall be for no other Mi&s;tre&s;s, I
promi&s;e Your Highne&s;s, I will not repine;</HI> or that, if
I do, <HI>it &s;hall be a &s;ilent Grie&s;, it &s;hall not interrupt
your Felicity.</HI></P>
<P>All this white I &s;aid I knew not what, and &s;aid
what I was no more able to do, than he was a|ble
to leave me; which, at that time, He own'd
he cou'd not do, no, not for the Prince&s;s her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But another Turn of Affairs determin'd this
Matter;for the Prince&s;s was taken very ill, and
in the Opinion of all her Phy&s;icians, very dange|rou&s;ly
&s;o;in her Sickne&s;s &s;he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with
her Lord, and to take her Leave of him: At this
grievous Parting, &s;he &s;aid &s;o many pa&s;&s;ionate kind
Things to him;lamented that &s;he had left him
no Children;&s;he had had three, but they were
dead; hinted to him, that it was one of the
chief things which gave her Satisfaction in Death,
us to this World; that &s;he &s;hould leave him room
to have Heirs to his Family, by &s;ome Prince&s;s
that &s;hould &s;upply her Place; with all Humility,
but with n Chri&s;tian Earne&s;tne&s;s recommended
to him to do Ju&s;tice to &s;uch Prince&s;s, whoever
it &s;hould be, from whom, <HI>to be &s;ure,</HI> he would ex|pect
Ju&s;tice; that is to &s;ay, to keep to her &s;ingly,
according to the &s;olemne&s;t Part of the Marriage
Covenant; humbly ask'd his Highne&s;s Pardon, if
&s;he had any way offended him; and appealing to
Heaven, before who&s;e Tribunal &s;he was to ap|ppear,
that &s;he had never violated her Honour,
or her Duty to him; and praying to Je&s;us, and
the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, for his Highne&s;s;and thus with
<PB N="132" REF="137">
the mo&s;t moving, and mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;i|ons
of her Affection to him, took her la&s;t Leave
of him, and died the next Day.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e from a Prince&s;s &s;o valuable in her|&s;elf,
and &s;o dear to him, and the Lo&s;s of her fol|lowing
&s;o immediately after, made &s;uch deep Im|pre&s;&s;ions
on him, that he look'd back with De|te&s;tation
upon the former Part of his Life; grew
melancholly and re&s;erv'd; chang'd his Society,
and much of the general Conduct of his Life;
re&s;olv'd on a Life regulated mo&s;t &s;trictly by the
Rules of Virtue, and Piety;and in a word, was
quite another Man.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of his Reformation, was a Storm
upon me;for, about ten Days after the Prince&s;s's
Funeral, he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to me by his Gentle|man,
intimating, tho' in very civil Terms, and
with a &s;hort Preamble, or Introduction, that he
de&s;ir'd I wou'd not take it ill that he was oblig'd
to let me know, that <HI>he could &s;ee me no more:</HI> His
Gentleman told me a long Story of the new Re|gulation
of Life his Lord had taken up, and that
he had been &s;o afflicted for the Lo&s;s or his Prin|ce&s;s,
that he thought it would either &s;horten his
Life, or he wou'd retire into &s;ome Religious
Hou&s;e, to end his Days in Solitude.</P>
<P>I need not direct any-body to &s;uppo&s;e how I
receiv'd this News; I was indeed, exceedingly
&s;urpriz$ d at it, and had much a-do to &s;upport my|&s;elf,
when the fir&s;t Part of it was deliver'd;tho'
the Gentleman deliver'd his Errand with great
Re&s;pect, and with all the Regard to me, that
he was able, and with a great deal of Ceremony;
al&s;o telling me how much he was concerned to
bring me &s;uch a Me&s;&s;sge.</P>
<P>But when I heard the Particulars of the Story
at large, and e&s;pecially, that of the Lady's Di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="138">
to the Prince, a little before her Death, I
was fully &s;atisfied;I knew very well He had
done nothing but what any Man mu&s;t do, that
had a true Sence upon him of the Ju&s;tice of
the Prince&s;s's Di&s;cour&s;e to him, and of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
there was of his altering his Cour&s;e of
Life, if he intended to be either a Chri&s;tian, or
an hone&s;t Man: I &s;ay, when I heard this, I was
perfectly ea&s;ie;I confe&s;s it was a Circum&s;tance
that it might be rea&s;onably expected &s;hou'd have
wrought &s;omething al&s;o upon me: I that had &s;o
much to reflect upon more, than the Prince;that
had now no more Temptation of Poverty, or of
the powerful Motive, which <HI>Amy</HI> us'd with me,
namely, <HI>Comply and live; deny and &s;tarve;</HI> I &s;ay, I
that had no Poverty to introduce Vice, but was
grown not only well &s;upply'd, but Rich, and not
only Rich, but was very Rich; in a word, richer
than I knew how to think of; for the Truth of
it was, that thinking of it &s;ometimes, almo&s;t di|&s;tracted me, for want of knowing how to di&s;|po&s;e
of it, and for fear of lo&s;ing it all again by
&s;ome Cheat or Trick, not knowing any-body that
I could commit the Tru&s;t of it to.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides I &s;hould add at the Clo&s;e of this Affair,
that the Prince did not, as I may &s;ay, turn me off
rudely, and with Di&s;gu&s;t;but with all the Decen|cy
and Goodne&s;s peculiar to him&s;elf, and that
could con&s;i&s;t with a Man reform'd, and &s;truck
with the Sence of his having abus'd &s;o good a
Lady as his late Prince&s;s had been; nor did he
&s;end me away empty, but did every thing like
him&s;elf;and in particular, order'd his Gentleman
to pay the Rent of the Hou&s;e, and all the Ex|pence
of his two Sons; and to tell me how they
were taken Care of, and where; and al&s;o, that
I might, at all times, in&s;pect the U&s;age they
<PB N="134" REF="139">
had, and if I di&s;lik'd anything, it &s;hould be recti|fied;
and Having thus fini&s;h'd every thing, he re|tir'd
into <HI>Lorrain,</HI> or &s;omewhere that Way, where
he had an E&s;tate, and I never heard of him more,
I mean, not as a Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Now I was at Liberty to go to any Part of
the World, and take Care of my Money my&s;elf:
The fir&s;t thing that I re&s;olv'd to do, was to go
directly to <HI>England,</HI> for there, I thought, being a|mong
my Countryfolks, (for I e&s;teem'd my&s;elf an
<HI>English-Woman,</HI> tho' I was born in <HI>France,</HI>) but
there, I &s;ay, I thought I cou'd better manage things,
than in <HI>France,</HI> at lea&s;t, that I would be in le&s;s
Danger of being circumvented and deceiv'd; but
how to get away with &s;uch a Trea&s;ure as I had
with me, was a difficult Point, and what I was
greatly at a Lo&s;s about.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant in <HI>Paris,</HI> that
was a Per&s;on of great Reputation for a Man of
Substance, and of Hone&s;ty, but I had no man|ner
of Acquaintance with him, nor did I know
how to get acquainted with him, &s;o as to di&s;co|ver
my Circum&s;tances to him; but at la&s;t I em|ploy'd
my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;uch I mu&s;t be allow'd to
call her, (notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid of
her) becau&s;e &s;he was in the Place of a Maid-Ser|vant;
I &s;ay, I employ'd my Maid <HI>Amy</HI> to go to
him, and &s;he got a Recommendation to him from
&s;omebody el&s;e, I knew not who;&s;o that &s;he got
Acce&s;s to him well enough.</P>
<P>But now was my Ca&s;e as bad as before; for
when I came to him, what cou'd I do? I had
Money and Jewels, to a va&s;t Value, and I might
leave all tho&s;e with him; that I might indeed, do;
and &s;o I might with &s;everal other Merchants in
<HI>Paris,</HI> who wou'd give me Bills for it, payable at
<HI>London,</HI> but then I ran a Hazard of my Money;
<PB N="135" REF="140">
and I had no-body at <HI>London</HI> to &s;end the Bills to,
and &s;o to &s;tay till I had an Account that they
were accepted; for I had not one Friend in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
that I cou'd have recour&s;e to, &s;o that, indeed,
I knew not what to do.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e I had no Remedy, but that I mu&s;t
tru&s;t &s;omebody; &s;o &s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>this Dutch</HI> Mer|chant,
as I &s;aid above; he was a little &s;urpriz'd
when <HI>Amy</HI> came to him, and talk'd to him of re|mitting
a Sum of about 12000 Pi&s;toles to <HI>England,</HI>
and began to think &s;he came to put &s;ome Cheat:
upon him; but when he found that <HI>Amy</HI> was but
a Servant, and that I came to him my&s;elf, the
Ca&s;e was alter'd pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>When I came to him my&s;elf, I presently &s;aw
&s;uch a plainne&s;s in his Dealing, and &s;uch Hone&s;ty
in his Countenance, that I made no Scruple to tell
him my whole Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That I was a Widow;
that I had &s;ome Jewels to di&s;po&s;e of, and al&s;o
&s;ome Money, which I had a-mind to &s;end to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and to follow there my&s;elf; but being but a
Woman, and having no Corre&s;pondence in <HI>London,</HI>
or any-where el&s;e, I knew not what to do, or how
to &s;ecure my Effects.</P>
<P>He dealt very candidly with me, but advis'd
me, when he knew my Ca&s;e &s;o particularly, to
take Bills upon <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and to go that Way
to <HI>England;</HI> for that I might lodge my Trea&s;ure
in the Bank there, in the mo&s;t &s;ecure Manner in
the World; and that there he cou'd recommend
me to a Man who perfectly under&s;tood Jewels, and
would deal faithfully with me in the di&s;po&s;ing
than.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, but &s;crupled very much the
travelling &s;o far in a &s;trange Country, and e&s;peci|ally
with &s;uch a Trea&s;ure about me; that whether
known, or conceal'd, I did not know how to ven|ture
<PB N="136" REF="141">
with it: Then he told me, me wou'd try to
di&s;po&s;e of them there, that is, at <HI>Paris,</HI> and con|vert
them into Money, and &s;o get me Bills for the
whole; and in a few Days he brought a <HI>Jew</HI> to
me, who pretended to buy the Jewels.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Jew</HI> &s;aw the Jewels, I &s;aw my
Folly; and it was ten Thou&s;and to one but I had
been ruin$d, and perhaps, put to Death in as cruel
a Manner as po&s;&s;ible; and I was put in &s;uch a
Fright by it, that I was once upon the Point of
flying for my Life, and leaving the Jewels and
Money too, in the Hands of the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> with|out
any Bills, or any thing el&s;e;the Ca&s;e was
thus:</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Jew</HI> &s;aw the Jewels, he falls
a jabbering in <HI>Dutch,</HI> or <HI>Partugue&s;e,</HI> to the Mer|chant,
and I cou'd presently perceive that they
were in &s;ome great Surprize, both of them; the
<HI>Jew</HI> held up his Hands, look'd at me with &s;ome
Horrour, then talk'd <HI>Dutch</HI> again, and put him|&s;elf
into a thou&s;and Shapes, twi&s;ting his Body,
and wringing up his Face this Way, and that
Way, in his Di&s;cour&s;e; &s;tamping with his Feet,
and throwing abroad his Hands, as if he was not
an a Rage only, but in a meer Fury; then he
wou'd turn, and give a Look at me, like the Devil;
I thought I never &s;aw any thing &s;o frightful in
my Life.</P>
<P>At length I put in a Word; Sir, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> to the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, What is all this Di&s;cour&s;e to my
Bu&s;ine&s;s? What is this Gentleman in all the&s;e
Pa&s;&s;ions about? I wi&s;h, if he is to treat with me, he
Wou'd &s;peak, that I may under&s;tand him; or if
you have Bu&s;ine&s;s of your own between you, that
is to be done fir&s;t, let me withdraw, and I'll come
again when you are at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="142">
No, no, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Dutchman,</HI> very kindly,
you mu&s;t not go, all our Di&s;cour&s;e is about you,
and your Jewels, and you &s;hall hear it pre&s;ently,
it concerns you very much, I a&s;&s;ure you: Con|cern
me, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what can it concern me &s;o much, as
to put this Gentleman into &s;uch Agonies? and
what makes him give me &s;uch Devil's Looks as he
does? why he looks as if he wou'd devour me.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jew</HI> understood me pre&s;ently, continuing in
a kind of Rage, and &s;poke in <HI>French,</HI> Yes, Madam,
it doesr, concern you much, very much, very much,
repeating the Words, &s;haking his Head, and
then turning to the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> pray
tell her what is the Ca&s;e; no, <HI>&s;ays the Merchant,</HI>
not yet, let us talk a little farther of it by our|&s;elves;
upon which, they withdrew into another
Room, where &s;till they talk'd very high, but in
a Language I did not under&s;tand: I began to be
a little &s;upriz'd at what the <HI>Jew</HI> had &s;aid, you
may be &s;ure, and eager to know what he meant,
and was very impatient till the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant
came back, and that &s;o impatient, that I call'd one
of his Servants to let him know, I de&s;ir'd to &s;peak
with him; when he came in, I ask'd his Pardon
for being &s;o impatient, but told him, I cou'd not
be ea&s;ie, till he had told me what the Meaning
of all this was: Why Madam, <HI>&s;ays the Dutch Mer|chant,</HI>
in &s;hort, the Meaning is, what I am &s;ur|priz'd
at too: This Man is a <HI>Jew,</HI> and under|&s;tands
Jewels perfectly well, and that was the Rea|&s;on
I &s;ent for him, to di&s;po&s;e of them to him, for
you; but as &s;oon as he &s;aw them, he knew the
Jewels very di&s;tinctly, and flying out in a Pa&s;&s;ion,
as you &s;ee he did; told me, in &s;hort, that they
were the very Parcel of Jewels which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Jeweller had about him, who was robb'd going to
<HI>Ver&s;ailies,</HI> (about eight Years ago) to &s;how them
<PB N="138" REF="143">
the Prince <HI>d'</HI>&mdash;, and that it was for the&s;e ve|ry
Jewels that the poor Gentleman was murther'd;
and he is in all this Agony to make me ask you,
how you came by them; and he &s;ays, you ought
to be charg'd with the Robbery and Murther,
and put to the Que&s;tion, to discover who were the
Per&s;ons that did it, that they might be brought to
Ju&s;tice: While he &s;aid this, the <HI>Jew</HI> came impu|dently
back, into the Room, without calling,
which a little &s;urpriz'd me again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant &s;poke pretty good <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
and he knew that the <HI>Jew</HI> did not under&s;tand <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
at-all; &s;o he told me the latter Part, when the
<HI>Jew</HI> came into the Room, in <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> at which I
&s;mil'd, which put the <HI>Jew</HI> into his mad Fit again,
and &s;haking his Head, and making his Devil's Fa|ces
again, he &s;eem'd to threaten me for Laugh|ing;
&s;aying in <HI>French,</HI> This was an Affair I &s;hou'd
have little Rea&s;on to laugh at, and the like; at
this, I laugh'd again, and flouted him, letting him
&s;ee, that I &s;corn'd him; and turning to the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Merchant, <HI>Sir</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>That tho&s;e Jewels were be|longing
to Mr.&mdash;, the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Jeweller,</HI> name|ing
his Name readily, <HI>in that,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>this Per&s;on is
right, but that I &s;hou'd be question'd</HI> how I came to
have them, <HI>is a Token of his Ignorance; which,</HI> how|ever,
<HI>he might have manag'd with a little mare good
Manners, till I had told him who I am; and both
he, and you too? will be more ea&s;ie in that Part, when
I &s;hould tell you, that I am the unhappy Widow of
that Mr.&mdash;, who was &s;o barbarou&s;ly murther'd
going to</HI> Ver&s;ailles; <HI>and that he was not robb'd of
tho&s;e Jewels, but of others; Mr.&mdash;having
left tho&s;e behind him, with me, le&s;t he &s;hould be robb'd;
had I,</HI> Sir, <HI>come otherwi&s;e by them, I &s;hould not have
been weak enough to have expos'd them to Sale here,
where the Thing was done, but have carried them far|ther
off.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="144">
This was an agreeable Surprize to the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Merchant, who being an hone&s;t Man him&s;elf,
believ'd every thing I &s;aid, which indeed, be|ing
all really and literally true, except the De|ficiency
of my Marriage, I &s;poke with &s;uch an
unconcern'd Ea&s;ine&s;s, that it might plainly be
&s;een, that I had no Guilt upon me, as the <HI>Jew</HI>
&s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jew</HI> was confounded when he heard that I
was the <HI>Jeweller's Wife;</HI> but as I had rais'd his Pa&s;|&s;ion,
with &s;aying, he look'd at me with a De|vil's
Face, he &s;tudied Mi&s;chief in his Heart, and
an&s;wer'd, <HI>That &s;hould not &s;erve my Turn;</HI> &s;o call'd
the <HI>Dutchman</HI> out again, when he told him, that
he re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute this Matter farther.</P>
<P>There was one kind Chance in this Affair,
which indeed, was my Deliverance, and that was,
that the Fool cou'd not re&s;train his Pa&s;&s;ion, but
mu&s;t let it fly to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant; to whom,
when they withdrew a &s;econd time, as above, he
told, that he would bring a Proce&s;s again&s;t me for
the Murther; and that it &s;hould co&s;t me dear,
for u&s;ing him at that rate; and <HI>away he went,</HI> de|&s;iring
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant to tell him when I wou'd
be there again: Had he &s;u&s;pected, that the <HI>Dutch|man</HI>
wou'd have communicated the Particulars to
me, he wou'd never have been &s;o fooli&s;h as to
have mention'd that Part to him.</P>
<P>But the Malice of his Thoughts anticipated
him, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant was &s;o good, as to
give me an Account of his De&s;ign, which indeed,
was wicked enough in its Nature; but to me it
would have been wor&s;e, than otherwi&s;e it wou'd
to another; for upon Examination, I cou'd not
have prov'd my&s;elf to be the Wife of the Jeweller,
&s;o the Su&s;picion might have been carried on with
the better Face; and then I &s;hou'd al&s;o, have
<PB N="140" REF="145">
brought all his Relations in <HI>England</HI> upon me;
who finding by the Proceedings, that I was not
his Wife, but a Mi&s;tre&s;s, or in <HI>Engli&s;h, a Whore,</HI>
wou'd immediately have laid Claim to the Jew|els,
as I had own'd them to be his.</P>
<P>This Thought immediately ru&s;h'd into my
Head, as &s;oon as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant had told
me, what wicked things were in the Head of that
cur&s;ed <HI>Jew;</HI> and the Villain (<HI>for &s;o I mu&s;t call him</HI>)
convinc'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant that he was in ear|ne&s;t,
by an Expre&s;&s;ion which &s;hew'd the re&s;t of
his De&s;ign, and that was a Plot to get the re&s;t of
the Jewels into his Hand.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t he hinted to the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> that the
Jewels, were &s;uch a Man's, meaning my Husband's,
he made wonderful Explanations on account of
their having been conceal'd &s;o long; where mu&s;t
they have lain? and what was the Woman that
brought them? and that &s;he, meaning me, ought
to he immediately apprehended, and put into the
Hands of Ju&s;tice; and this was the time that, as
I &s;aid, he made &s;uch horrid Ge&s;tures, and look'd
at me &s;o like a Devil.</P>
<P>The Merchant hearing him talk at that rate,
and &s;eeing him in earne&s;t, &s;aid to him, Hold your
Tongue a little, this is a thing of Con&s;equence;
if it be &s;o, let you and I go into the next Room
and con&s;ider of it there; and &s;o they withdrew,
and le&s;t me.</P>
<P>Here, as before, I was unea&s;ie, and call'd him
our, and having heard how it was, gave him than
An&s;wer, <HI>that I was his Wife,</HI> or Widow, which
the malicious <HI>Jew</HI> &s;aid <HI>&s;hou'd not &s;erve my turn;</HI> and
then it was, that the <HI>Dutchman</HI> call'd him out a|gain;
and in this time of his withdrawing, the
Merchant finding, as above, that he was really in
earne&s;t, counter $cited a little to be of his Mind,
<PB N="141" REF="146">
and enter'd into Propo&s;als with him for the thing
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this they agreed to go to an Advocate, or
Council, for Directions how to proceed, and to
meet again the next Day, again&s;t which time
the Merchant was to appoint me to come again
with the Jewels, in order to &s;ell them: <HI>No,</HI> &s;ays
the Merchant, <HI>I will go farther with her than &s;o; I
will de&s;ire her to leave the Jewels with me, to &s;how to a|nother
Per&s;on, in order to get the better Price for them:
That's right, &s;ays the Jew, and I'll engage &s;he &s;hall
Never be Mi&s;tre&s;s of them again; they &s;hall either be
&s;eiz'd by us, &s;ays he, in the King's Name, or &s;he &s;hall
be glad to give them up to us, to prevent her being put
to the Torture.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant &s;aid Yes to every thing he
offer'd, and they agreed to meet the next mor|ning
about it, and I was to be per&s;waded to
leave the Jewels with him, and come to them
the next Day, at four a-Clock, in order to make
a good Bargain for them; and on the&s;e Con|ditions
they parted; but the hone&s;t <HI>Dutchman,</HI>
fill'd with Indignation at the barbarous De&s;ign,
came directly to me, and told me the whole
Story; <HI>and now,</HI> Madam, &s;ays he, <HI>you are to con&s;i|der
immediately what you have to do.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, if I was &s;ure to have Ju&s;tice, I
would not fear all that &s;uch a Rogue cou'd do
to me; but how &s;uch things were carried on
in <HI>France</HI> I knew not, I told him, the greate&s;t
Difficulty would be to prove our Marriage, for
that it was done in <HI>England,</HI> and in a remote
Part of <HI>England</HI> too, and which was wor&s;e, it
would be hard to produce authentick Vouchers
of it, becau&s;e we were Married in Private: <HI>But
as to the Death of your Husband,</HI> Madam, <HI>what
can be &s;aid to that?</HI> &s;aid he; <HI>nay,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>what can
<PB N="142" REF="147">
they &s;ay to it?</HI> In <HI>England,</HI> added I, if they wou'd
offer &s;uch an Injury to any one, they mu&s;t prove
the Fact, or give ju&s;t Rea&s;on for their Su&s;pici|ons;
that my Husband was Murther'd, that
every one knows; but that he was robb'd, or of
what, or how much, that none knows, no, not
my&s;elf; and why was I not que&s;tion'd for it
then? I have liv'd in <HI>Paris</HI> ever &s;ince, liv'd pub|lickly
and no Man had yet the Impudence to &s;ug|ge&s;t,
&s;uch a thing of me.</P>
<P>I am fully &s;atisfied of that, <HI>&s;ays the Merchant;</HI>
but as this is a Rogue, who will &s;tick at nothing,
what can we &s;ay? and who knows what he may
&s;wear? &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould &s;wear, that he knows
your Husband had tho&s;e particular Jewels with
him the Morning when the went out, and that he
&s;hew'd them to him, to con&s;ider their Value, and
what Price he &s;hould ask the Prince <HI>de</HI>&mdash;for
them.</P>
<P>Nay, by the &s;ame Rule, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> he may &s;wear,
that I murther'd my Husband, if he finds it
for his Turn: That's true, <HI>&s;aid he;</HI> and if he
&s;hou'd, I do not &s;ee what cou'd &s;ave you; but I
added, I have found out his more immediate De|&s;ign;
his De&s;ign is to have you carried to the
<HI>$word$,</HI> that the Su&s;picion may appear ju&s;t;
and then to get the Jewels out of your Hands,
if po&s;&s;ible; then, at la&s;t, to drop the Pro&s;e|cution,
on your contening to quit the Jewels to
him; and how you will do to avoid this, is the
Que&s;tion, which I would have you con&s;ider of.</P>
<P>My Misfortune, or, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> is, that I have no
Time to con&s;ider, and I have no Per&s;on to con|&s;ider
with, or advi&s;e about it; I find, that In|nocence
may be oppre&s;s'd by &s;uch an impudent
Fellow as this; he that does not value a Perjury,
has any Man's Life at his Mercy; but Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="148">
is the Ju&s;tice &s;uch here, that while I may be in
the Hands of the Publick, and under Pro&s;ecution,
he may get hold of my Effects, and get my Jew|els
into his Hands?</P>
<P>I don't know, <HI>&s;ay he,</HI> what may be done in that
Ca&s;e; but if not he, if the Court of Ju&s;tice &s;hou'd
get hold of them, I do not know but you may find
it as difficult to get them out of their Hands a|gain,
and, at lea&s;t, it may co&s;t you half as much as
they are worth; &s;o I think it would be a much
better Way, to prevent their coming at them
at-all.</P>
<P>But what Cour&s;e can I take to do that, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI>
now they have got Notice, that I have them? If
they get me into their Hands, they will oblige me
to produce them, or perhaps, &s;entence me to Pri|&s;on
till I do.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> as this Brute &s;ays too, put you
to the Que&s;tion? that is, to the Torture, on Pre|tence
of making you confe&s;s who were the Mur|therers
of your Husband.</P>
<P>Confe&s;s! <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> how can I confe&s;s what I know
nothing of?</P>
<P>If they come to have you to the Rack, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
they will make you confe&s;s you did it your&s;elf,
whether you did it or no, and then you are ca&s;t.</P>
<P>The very word Rack frighted me to Death al|mo&s;t,
and I had no Spirit left in me: Did it my|&s;elf!
<HI>&s;aid I;</HI> that's impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P>No, Madam, &s;ays he, 'tis far from impo&s;&s;ible;
the mo&s;t innocent People in the World have
been forc'd to cenfe&s;s them&s;elves Guilty of what
they never heard of, much le&s;s, had any Hand in.</P>
<P>What then mu&s;t I do? <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> what wou'd you
advi&s;e me to?</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I wou'd advi&s;e you to be gone;
you intended to go away in four or five Days,
<PB N="144" REF="149">
and you may as well go in two Days; and if
you can do &s;o, I &s;hall manage it &s;o, that he &s;hall
not &s;u&s;pect your being gone, for &s;everal Days af|ter:
Then he told me, how the Rogue wou'd have
me order'd to bring the Jewels the next Day, for
Sale; and that then he wou'd have me appre|hended;
how he had made the <HI>Jew</HI> believe he
wou'd join with him in his De&s;ign; and that he
[the Merchant] wou'd get the Jewels into his
Hands: Now, <HI>&s;ays the Merchant,</HI> I &s;hall give you
Bills for the Money you de&s;ir'd, immediately, and
&s;uch as &s;hall not fail of being paid; take your
Jewels with you, and go this very Evening to
<HI>St. Germains en Lay;</HI> I'll &s;end a Man thither with
you, and from thence, he &s;hall guide you to-Mor|row,
to <HI>Roan,</HI> where there lies a Ship of mine,
ju&s;t ready to &s;ail for <HI>Rotterdam;</HI> you &s;hall have
your Pa&s;&s;age in that Ship, on my Account, and I
will &s;end Orders for him to &s;ail as &s;oon as you
are on Board, and a Letter to my Friend at <HI>Rotter|dam,</HI>
to Entertain and take Care of you.</P>
<P>This was too kind an Offer for me, as things
&s;tood, not to be accepted, and be thankful for;
and as to going away, I had prepar'd every thing
for parting; &s;o that I had little to do, but to go
back, take two or three Boxes and Bundles, and
&s;uch things, and my Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> and be gone.</P>
<P>Then the Merchant told me the Mea&s;ures he
had re&s;olv'd to take to delude the <HI>Jew,</HI> while I
made my E&s;cape, which were very well contriv'd
indeed: FIRST, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> when he comes to-Mor|row,
I &s;hall tell him, that I propos'd to you, to
leave the Jewels with me, as we agreed; but that
you &s;aid, you wou'd come and bring them in the
Afrernoon, &s;o that we mu&s;t &s;tay for you till four
a-Clock; but then, at that time, I will &s;how a
Letter from you, as if ju&s;t come in, wherein you
<PB N="145" REF="150">
&s;hall excu&s;e your not coming; for that &s;ome Com|pany
came to vi&s;it you, and prevented you; but
that you de&s;ire me to take Care that the Gentle|man
be ready to buy your Jewels; and that you
will come to Morrow, at the &s;ame Hour, without
fail.</P>
<P>When to-Morrow is come, we &s;hall wait at
the Time, but you not appearing, I &s;hall &s;eem
mo&s;t di&s;&s;atisfied, and wonder what can be the
Rea&s;on; and &s;o we &s;hall agree to go the next
Day to get out a Proce&s;s again&s;t you; but the
next Day, in the Morning, I'll &s;end to give him
Notice, that you have been at my Hou&s;e, but he
not being there, have made another Appointment,
and that I de&s;ire to &s;peak with him; when he
comes, I'll tell him, you appear perfectly blind,
as to your Danger; and that you appear'd much
di&s;appointed that he did not come, tho' you cou'd
not meet the Night before; and oblig'd me to
have him here to-Morrow at three a-Clock; <HI>when
to-Morrow comes, &s;ays he, you &s;hall &s;end word, that
you are taken &s;o ill, that you cannot come out for that
Day; but that you will not fail the next Day; and
the next Day you &s;hall neither come or &s;end, nor let us
ever hear any more of you; for by that time you &s;hall be
in Holland, if you plea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I cou'd not but approve all his Mea&s;ures, &s;eeing
they were &s;o well contriv'd, and in &s;o friendly a
Manner, for my Benefit; and as he &s;eem'd to be
&s;o very &s;incere, I re&s;olv'd to put my Life in his
Hands: Immediately I went to my Lodgings, and
&s;ent away <HI>Amy</HI> with &s;uch Bundles as I had pre|par'd
for my Travelling; I al&s;o &s;ent &s;everal Par|cels
of my fine Furniture to the Merchant's hou&s;e,
to be &s;aid up for me, and bringing the Key of the
Lodgings with me, I came back to his Hou&s;e:
Here we fini&s;h'd our Matters of Money; and I de|liver'd
<PB N="146" REF="151">
into his Hands &s;even Thou&s;and eight Hun|dred
Pi&s;toles in Bills and Money; a Copy of an
A&s;&s;ignment on the Town-Hou&s;e of <HI>Paris,</HI> for 4000
Pi&s;toles, at 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, atte&s;ted; and a
Procuration for receiving the Intere&s;t halt-yearly;
but the Original I kept my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I cou'd have tru&s;ted all I had with him, for he
was perfectly hone&s;t, and had not the lea&s;t View of
doing me any Wrong; indeed, after it was &s;o ap|parent
that he had, as it were, &s;av'd my Life, or
at lea&s;t, &s;av'd me from being expos'd and ruin'd;
I &s;ay, after this, how cou'd I doubt him in any
thing?</P>
<P>When I came to him, he had every-thing rea|dy
as I wanted, and as he had propos'd as to my
Money, he gave me fir&s;t of all an accepted Bill,
payable at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> for 4000 Pi&s;toles, and
drawn from <HI>Genoa</HI> upon a Merchant at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI>
payable to a Merchant at <HI>Paris,</HI> and endors'd by
him to my Merchant; this-he a&s;&s;ur'd me wou'd be
punctually paid, and &s;o it was, to a Day; the re&s;t
I had in other Bills of Exchange, drawn by him|&s;elf
upon other Merchants in <HI>Holland:</HI> Having &s;e|cur'd
my Jewels too, as well as I cou'd, he &s;ent
me away the &s;ame Evening in a Friend's Coach,
which he had procur'd for me, to <HI>St. Germains,</HI>
and the next Morning to <HI>Roan;</HI> he al&s;o &s;ent a Ser|vant
of his own, on Hor&s;eback, with me, who
provided every thing for me, and who carried
his Orders to the Captain o$ the Ship, which
lay about three Miles below <HI>Roan,</HI> in the River, and
by his Directions I went immediately on Board:
The third Day after I was on Board, the Ship
went away, and we were out at Sea the next day
after that; and thus I took my Leave of <HI>France,</HI>
and got clear of an ugly Bu&s;ine&s;s, which, had it
gone on, might have ruin'd me, and &s;ent me back
<PB N="147" REF="152">
as Naked to <HI>England,</HI> as I was a little before I
left it.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Amy</HI> and I were at Lei&s;ure to look up|on
the Mi&s;chiefs that we had e&s;cap'd; and had I
had any Religion, or any Sence of a Supreme
Power managing, directing, and governing in both
Cau&s;es and Events in this World, &s;uch a Ca&s;e as
this wou'd have given any-body room to have been
very thankful to the Power who had not only put
&s;uch a Trea&s;ure into my Hand, but given me
&s;uch an E&s;cape from the Ruin that threaten'd
me; but I had none of tho&s;e things about me;
I had indeed, a grateful Sence upon my Mind of
the generous Friend&s;hip of my Deliverer, the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant; by whom I was &s;o faithfully
&s;erv'd, and by whom, as far as relates to &s;econd
Cau&s;es, I was pre&s;erv'd from De&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, I had a grateful Sence upon my Mind, of
his Kindne&s;s and Faithfullne&s;s to me, and I re&s;olv'd
to &s;how him &s;ome Te&s;timony of it, as &s;oon as I
came to the End of my Rambles, for I was yet
but in a State of Uncertainty, and &s;ometimes
that gave me a little Unea&s;ine&s;s too; I had Paper
indeed, for my Money, and he had &s;hew'd him|&s;elf
very good to me, in conveying me away, as
above: But I had not &s;een the End of things yet;
for unle&s;s the Bills were paid, I might &s;till he a
great Lo&s;er by my <HI>Dutchman,</HI> and he might, per|haps,
have contriv'd all that Affair of the <HI>Jew,</HI> to
put me into a Fright, and get me to run away,
and that, as if it were to &s;ave my Life; that if
the Bills &s;hould he refus'd, I was cheated, with a
Witne&s;s, and the like; but the&s;e were but Sur|mi&s;es,
and indeed, were perfectly without Cau&s;e;
for the hone&s;t Man acted as hone&s;t Men always
do; with an upright and di&s;intere&s;ted Principle;
and with a Sincerity not often to be found in the
<PB N="148" REF="153">
World; what Gain he made by the Exchange,
was ju&s;t, and was nothing but what was his Due,
and was in the Way of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; but other|wi&s;e
he made no Advantage of me at-all.</P>
<P>When I pa&s;s'd in the Ship between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Cal|lais,</HI>
and &s;aw Beloved <HI>England</HI> once more under my
View; <HI>England,</HI> which I counted my Native Coun|try,
being the Place I was bred up in, tho' not born
there; a &s;trange kind of Joy po&s;&s;e&s;s'd my Mind,
and I had &s;uch a longing De&s;ire to be there, that
I would have given the Ma&s;ter of the Ship twenty
Pi&s;toles to have &s;tood-over, and &s;et me on &s;hore in
the <HI>Downs;</HI> and when he told me he cou'd not
do it, that is, that he dur&s;t not do it, if I wou'd
have given him an hundred Pi&s;toles, I &s;ecretly
wi&s;h'd, that a Storm wou'd ri&s;e, that might drive
the Ship over to the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> whether
they wou'd or not, that I might be &s;et on Shore
any-where upon <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground.</P>
<P>This wicked Wi&s;h had not been out of my
Thoughts above two or three Hours, but the Ma|&s;ter
&s;teering away to the <HI>North,</HI> as was his Cour&s;e
to do, we lo&s;t Sight of Land on that Side, and
only had the <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Shore in View on our Right-hand,
or, as the Seamen call it, the Starboard-Side;
and then with the Lo&s;s of the Sight, the
Wi&s;h for Landing in <HI>England,</HI> abated; and I con|&s;ider'd
how fooli&s;h it was to wi&s;h my&s;elf out of
the Way of my Bu&s;ine&s;s; that if I had been on
Shore in <HI>England,</HI> I mu&s;t go back to <HI>Holland,</HI> on
account of my Bills, which were &s;o con&s;iderable,
and I having no Correspondence there, that I cou'd
not have manag'd it, without going my&s;elf: But
we had not been out of Sight of <HI>England</HI> many
Hours, before the Weather began to change,
the Wirds whi&s;tl'd, and made a Noi&s;e, and the
Seamen laid to one-another, that it wou'd Blow|hard
<PB N="149" REF="154">
hard at Night: It was then about two Hours be|fore
Sun-&s;et, and we were pa&s;s'd by <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and
I think they &s;aid we were in Sight of <HI>O&s;tend;</HI> but
then the Wind grew high, and the Sea &s;well'd,
and all things look'd terrible, e&s;pecially to us, that
under&s;tood nothing but ju&s;t what we &s;aw before us;
in &s;hort, Night came on, and very dark it was,
the Wind fre&s;hen'd, and blew harder and harder,
and about two Hours within Night, it blew a ter|rible
Storm.</P>
<P>I was not quite a Stranger to the Sea, having
come from <HI>Rochelle</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> when I was a Child,
and gone from <HI>London,</HI> by the River <HI>Thames,</HI> to
<HI>France</HI> afterward, as I have &s;aid: But I began to
be alarm'd a little with the terrible Clamour of
the Men over my Head, for I had never been in
a Storm, and &s;o had never &s;een the like, or heard
it; and once, offering to look out at the Door of
the Steerage, as they call'd it, it &s;truck me with
&s;uch Horrour, the darkne&s;s, the fiercene&s;s of the
Wind, the dreadful height of the Waves, and the
Hurry the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sailors were in, who&s;e Language
I did not under&s;tand one Word of; neither when
they curs'd, or when they pray'd; I &s;ay, all the&s;e
things together, fill'd me with Terror; and, in
&s;hort, I began to be very much frighted.</P>
<P>When I was come back into the Great-Cabbin,
there &s;at <HI>Amy,</HI> who was very Sea-&s;ick, and I had
a little before given her a Sup of Cordial-waters, to
help her Stomach: When <HI>Amy</HI> &s;aw me come back,
and &s;it down without &s;peaking, for &s;o I did, &s;he
look'd two or three times up at me, at la&s;t &s;he came
running to me, Dear Madam! <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> what is the
Matter? what makes you look &s;o pale? why,
you a'nt well; what is the Matter? I &s;aid nothing &s;till
but held up my Hands two or three times;
<HI>Amy</HI> doubl'd her Importunities; upon that, I &s;aid
<PB N="150" REF="155">
no more, but, <HI>&s;tep to the Steerage-Door, and look out
as, I did;</HI> &s;o &s;he went away immediately, and
looked too, as I had bidden her; but the poor Girl
came back again in the greate&s;t Amazement and
Horrour, that ever I &s;aw any poor Creature in,
wringing her Hands, and crying out &s;he was un|done!
&s;he was undone! &s;he &s;hou'd be drown'd!
they were all lo&s;t! Thus &s;he ran about the Cab|bin
like a mad thing, and as perfectly out of her
Sen&s;es, as any one in &s;uch a Ca&s;e cou'd be &s;up|pos'd
to be.</P>
<P>I was frighted, my&s;elf; but when I &s;aw the Girl
in &s;uch a terrible Agony, it brought me a little to
my&s;elf, and I began to talk to her, and put her in
a little Hope; I told her, there was many a Ship
in a Storm, that was not ca&s;t-away; and I hop'd
we &s;hou'd not be drown'd; that it was true, the
Storm was very dreadful, but I did not &s;ee that
the Seamen were &s;o much concern'd as we were;
and &s;o I talk'd to her as well as I cou'd, tho' my
Heart was full enough of it, as well as <HI>Amy</HI>'s, and
Death began to &s;tare in my Face, ay, and &s;ome|thing
el&s;e too, that is to &s;ay, Con&s;cience, and my
Mind was very much di&s;turb'd, but I had no|body
to comfort me.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> being in &s;o much wor&s;e a Condition,
that is to &s;ay, &s;o much more terrify'd at the
Storm, than I was, I had &s;omething to do to
comfort her; &s;he was, as I have &s;aid, like one
di&s;tracted, and went raving about the Cabbin,
crying our, &s;he was undone! undone! &s;he &s;hou'd
be drown'd, <HI>and the like;</HI> and at la&s;t, the Ship gi|ving
a Jerk, by the Force, I &s;uppo&s;e, of &s;ome vio|lent
Wave, it threw poor <HI>Amy</HI> quite down, for
&s;he was weak enough before, with being Sea-&s;ick,
and as it threw her forward, the poor Girl &s;t$uck
her Head again&s;t the Bulk-head, as the Seamen
<PB N="151" REF="156">
call it, of the Cabbin, and &s;aid her as dead as a
Stone, upon the Floor, or Deck, that is to &s;ay,
&s;he was &s;o to all Appearance.</P>
<P>I cry'd out for Help; but at had been all one,
to have cry'd out on the top of a Mountain,
where no-body had been within five Miles of me;
for the Seamen were &s;o engag'd, and made &s;o much
Noi&s;e, that no-body heard me, or came near me;
I open'd the Great-Cabbin Door, and look'd into
the Steerage, to cry for Help, but there, to en|crea&s;e
my Fright, was two Seamen on their Knees,
at Prayers, and only one Man who &s;teer'd, and
he made a groaning Noi&s;e too, which I took to be
&s;aying his Prayers, but it &s;eems it was an&s;wering to
tho&s;e above, when they call'd to him, to tell him
which Way to &s;teer.</P>
<P>Here was no Help for me, or for poor <HI>Amy,</HI>
and there &s;he lay &s;till &s;o, and in &s;uch a Condition,
that I did not know whether &s;he was dead or a|live;
in this Fright I went to her, and lifted her
a little way up, &s;etting her on the Deck, with her
Back to the Boards of the Bulk-head, and I got
a little Bottle out of my Pocket, and I held it
to her No&s;e, and rubb'd her Temples, and what
el&s;e I coulld do, but &s;till <HI>Amy</HI> &s;hew'd no Signs of
Life, till I felt for her Pul&s;e, but could hardly di&s;tin|gui&s;h
her to be alive; however, after a great while,
&s;he began to revive, and in about half an Hour
&s;he came to her&s;elf, but remember'd nothing at
fir&s;t of what had happen'd to her, for a good-while
more.</P>
<P>When &s;he recover'd more fully, &s;he ask'd me
where &s;he was? I told her, &s;he was in the Ship
yet, but God knows how long it might be; Why,
Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> is not the Storm over? <HI>No, no,</HI>
&s;ays I, <HI>Amy; why, Madam,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>it was calm ju&s;t now,</HI> (meaning when &s;he was in the &s;wooning
<PB N="152" REF="157">
Fit, occa&s;ion'd by her Fall,) <HI>Calm</HI> Amy, <HI>&s;ays I,
'tis far from calm; it may be it will be calm by-and-by,
when we all drown'd, and gone to</HI> HEAVEN.</P>
<P>HEAVEN! madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> what makes you
talk &s;o? HEAVEN! I go to HEAVEN! <HI>No,
no,</HI> If I am drown'd, I am damn'd! <HI>Don't you know
what a wicked Creature I have been?</HI> I have been a
Whore to two Men, and have liv'd a wretched a|bominable
Life of Vice and Wickedne&s;s for four|teen
Years; O Madam, <HI>you know it,</HI> and GOD
knows it; and now <HI>I am to die; to be drown'd; O!</HI>
what will become of me? <HI>I am undone for Ever!</HI> ay,
Madam, <HI>for Ever! to all Eternity! O I am lo&s;t! I
am lO&s;t! If I am drown'd, I am lo&s;t for Ever!</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e, you will ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, mu&s;t be &s;o
many Stabs into the very Soul of one in my own
Ca&s;e; it immediately occur'd to me, <HI>Poor</HI> Amy!
<HI>what art thou, that I am not?</HI> what ha&s;t thou been,
that I have not been? Nay, I am guilty of my
own Sin, and thine too: Then it came to my Re|membrance,
that I had not only been the &s;ame with
<HI>Amy,</HI> but that I had been the Devil's In&s;trument,
to make her wicked; that I had &s;tripp'd her,
and pro&s;tituted her to the very Man that I had
been Naught with my&s;elf; that &s;he had but fol|low'd
me; I had been her wicked Example; and
I had led her into all; and that as we had &s;inn'd
together, now we were likely to &s;ink together.</P>
<P>All this repeated it&s;elf to my Thoughts at that
very Moment; and every one of <HI>Amy</HI>'s Cries
&s;ounded thus in my Ears: I am the wicked Cau&s;e
of it all; I have been thy Ruin, <HI>Amy;</HI> I have
brought thee to this, and now thou art to &s;uffer
for the Sin I have entic'd thee to; and if thou art
lo&s;t for ever, <HI>what mu&s;t I be?</HI> what mu&s;t be my
Portion?</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="158">
It is true, this Difference was between us, that
I &s;aid all the&s;e things within my&s;elf, and &s;igh'd,
and mourn'd inwardly; but <HI>Amy,</HI> as her Temper
was more violent, &s;poke aloud, and cry'd, and
call'd out aloud, like one in an Agony.</P>
<P>I had but &s;mall Encouragement to give her, and
indeed, con'd &s;ay but very little; but I got her
to compo&s;e her&s;elf a little, and not let any of the
People of the Ship under&s;tand what &s;he meant,
or what &s;he &s;aid; but even in her greate&s;t Com|po&s;ure, &s;he continued to expre&s;s her&s;elf with the
utmo&s;t Dread and Terror, on account of the wick|ed
Life &s;he had liv'd; and crying out, &s;he &s;hou'd
be damn'd, and the like; which was very terri|ble
to me, who knew what Condition I was in my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e &s;erious Con&s;iderations, I was very
Penitent too, for my former Sins, and cry'd out,
<HI>tho' &s;oftly,</HI> two or three times, <HI>Lord have Mercy up|on
me;</HI> to this, I added abundance or Re&s;olutions,
of what a Life I wou'd live, if it &s;hould plea&s;e
God but to &s;pare my Life but this one time;
how I would live a &s;ingle and a virtuous Life,
and &s;pend a great deal of what I had thus wick|edly
got, in Acts of Charity, and doing Good.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e dreadful Apprehen&s;ions, I look'd
back on the Life I had led, with the utmo&s;t Con|tempt
and Abhorrence; I blu&s;h'd, and wonder'd
at my&s;elf, how I cou'd act thus; how I cou'd di|ve&s;t
my&s;elf of Mode&s;ty and Honour, and pro&s;ti|tute
my&s;elf for $$in; and I thought, if ever it
&s;hou'd plea&s;e G$$ to &s;pare me this one time from
Death, it wou'd not be po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould be
the &s;ame Creature again.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> went farther; &s;he pray'd, &s;he re&s;olv'd, &s;he
vow'd to lead a new Life, if God wou'd &s;pare
her but this time: It now began to be Day-light,
<PB N="154" REF="159">
for the Storm held all Night-long, and it was
&s;ome Comfort to &s;ee the Light of another Day,
which indeed, none of us expected; but the Sea
went Mountains high, and the Noi&s;e of the Wa|ter
was as frightful to us, as the Sight of the
Waves; nor was any Land to be &s;een; nor did
the Seamen know whereabout they were; at la&s;t,
to our great Joy, they made Land, which was in
<HI>England,</HI> and on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Suffolk;</HI> and the
Ship being in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s, they ran for
the Shore, at all Hazards, and with great Diffi|culty,
got into <HI>Harwich,</HI> where they were &s;afe,
as to the Danger of Death; but the Ship was &s;o
full of Water, and &s;o much damag'd, that if they
had not laid her on Shore the &s;ame Day, &s;he
wou'd have &s;unk before Night, according to the
Opinion of the Seamen, and of the Workmen
on Shore too, who were hir'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in
&s;topping their Leaks.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was reviv'd as &s;oon as &s;he heard they
had e&s;py'd Land, and went out upon the
Deck, but &s;he &s;oon came in again to me, <HI>O Ma|dam,
&s;ays &s;he, there's the Land indeed, to be &s;een,
it looks like a Ridge of Clouds, and may be all a
Cloud, for ought I know, but if it be Land, tis a
great Way off; and the Sea is in &s;uch a Combu&s;tion,
we &s;hall all peri&s;h before we can reach it; '$s the
dreadfulle&s;t Sight, to look at the Waves, that ever
was &s;een; why, they are as high as Mountains; we
&s;hall certainly be all &s;wallow'd up, for-all the Land is
&s;o near.</HI></P>
<P>I had conceiv'd &s;ome Hope, that if they &s;aw
Land, we &s;hould be deliver'd; and I told her,
&s;he did not under&s;tand things of that Nature;
that &s;he might be &s;ure, if they &s;aw Land, they
would go directly towards it, and wou'd make
into &s;ome Harbour; but it was, as <HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, a
<PB N="155" REF="160">
frightful Di&s;tance to it: The Land looked like
Clouds, and the Sea went as high as Mountains,
&s;o that no Hope appear'd in the &s;eeing the Land;
but we were in fear of $ounding, before we cou'd
reach it; this made <HI>Amy</HI> &s;o de&s;ponding &s;till; but
as the Wind, which blew from the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> or that
Way, drove us furiou&s;ly towards the Land; &s;o
when, about half an Hour after, I &s;tept to the
Ste$rage-Door, and look'd-out, I &s;aw the Land
much nearer than <HI>Amy</HI> repre&s;entd it; &s;o I went
in, and encourag'd <HI>Amy</HI> again, and indeed, was
encourag'd my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In about an Hour, or &s;omething more, we &s;ee,
to our infinite Satisfaction, the open Harbour of
<HI>Harwich,</HI> and the Ve&s;&s;el &s;tanding directly towards
it, and in a few Minutes more, the Ship was in
&s;mooth Water, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible Comfort;
and thus I had, tho' again&s;t my Will, and contra|ry
to my true Intere&s;t, what I wi&s;h'd for, to be
driven away to <HI>England,</HI> tho' it was by a Storm.</P>
<P>Nor did this Incident do either <HI>Amy</HI> or me
much Service; for the Danger being over, the
Fears of Death vani&s;h'd with it; ay, and our
Fear of what was beyond Death al&s;o; our
Sence of the Life we had liv'd, went off, and
with our return to Life, our wicked Ta&s;te of Life
return'd, and we were both the &s;ame as before,
if not wor&s;e: So certain is it, that the Repent|ance
which is brought about by the meer Appre|hen&s;ions
of Death, wears off as tho&s;e Apprehen|&s;ions
wear off; and Death-bed Repentance, or
Storm-Repentance, which is much the &s;ame, is
&s;eldom true.</P>
<P>However, I do not tell you, that this was
all at once, neither; the Fright we had at Sea
la&s;ted a little while afterwards, at lea&s;t, the Im|pre&s;&s;ion
was not quite blown off, as &s;oon as the
<PB N="156" REF="161">
Storm; e&s;pecialiy poor <HI>Amy,</HI> as &s;oon as &s;he &s;et
her Foot on Shore, &s;he fell flat upon the Ground,
and ki&s;s'd it, and gave God thanks for her Deli|verance
from the Sea; and turning to me when &s;he
got up, I hope, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you will never go
upon the Sea again.</P>
<P>I know not what ail'd me, not I; but <HI>Amy</HI>
was much more penitent at Sea, and much more
&s;en&s;ible of her Deliverance when &s;he Landed, and
was &s;afe, than I was; I was in a kind of Stupi|dity,
I know not well what to call it; I had a
Mind full of Horrour in the time of the Storm,
and &s;aw Death before me, as plainly as <HI>Amy,</HI> but
my Thoughts got no Vent, as <HI>Amy</HI>'s did; I had
a &s;ilent &s;ullen kind of Grief, which cou'd not
break out either in Words or Tears, and which
was, therefore, much the wor&s;e to bear.</P>
<P>I had a Terror upon me for my wicked Life
pa&s;t, and firmly believ'd I was going to the Bot|tom,
launching into Death, where I was to give
an Account of all my pa&s;t Actions; and in this
State, and on that Account, I look'd back upon
my Wickedne&s;s with Abhorrence, as I have &s;aid
above; but I had no Sence of Repentance, from
the true Motive of Repentance; I &s;aw nothing of
the Corruption of Nature, the Sin of my Life, as
an Offence again&s;t God; as a thing odious to the
Holine&s;s of his Being; as abu&s;ing his Mercy, and
de&s;pi&s;ing his Goodne&s;s; in &s;hort, I had no thorow
effectual Repentance; no Sight of my Sins in their
proper Shape; no View of a Redeemer, or Hope
in him: I had only &s;uch a Repentance as a Crimi|nal
has at the Place of Execution, who is &s;orry,
not that he has committed the Crime, as it is a
Crime, but &s;orry <HI>that he is to be Hang'd for it.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Amy</HI>'s Repentance wore off too, as
well as mine, but not &s;o &s;oon; however, we were
both, very grave for a time.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="162">
As &s;oon as we could get a Boat from the Town,
we went on Shore, and immediately went to a
Publick-Hou&s;e in the Town of <HI>Harwich;</HI> where
we were to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, what was to be
done, and whether we &s;hould go up to <HI>London,</HI> or
&s;tay till the Ship was refitted, which, they &s;aid,
would be Fortnight, and then go for <HI>Holland,</HI> as
we intended, and as Bu&s;ine&s;s requir'd.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on directed that I &s;hou'd go to <HI>Holland,</HI>
for there I had all my Money to receive, and there
I had Per&s;ons of good Reputation and Character,
to apply to, having Letters to them from the ho|ne&s;t
<HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant at <HI>Paris,</HI> and they might,
perhaps, give me a Recommendation again, to
Merchants in <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o I &s;hould get Acquain|tance
with &s;ome People of Figure, which was
what I lov'd; whereas now I knew not one Crea|ture
in the whole City of <HI>London,</HI> or any-where
el&s;e, that I cou'd go and make my&s;elf known to:
Upon the&s;e Considerations, I re&s;olv'd to go to <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
a whatever came on it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> cry'd and trembled, and was ready to
fall into Fits, when I did but mention going upon
the Sea again, and begg'd of me, not to go, or if
I wou'd go, that I wou'd leave her behind, tho' I
was to &s;end her a-begging; the People in the Inn
laugh'd at her, and je&s;ted with her; ask'd her, if
&s;he had any Sins to confe&s;s, that &s;he was a&s;ham'd
&s;hou'd be heard of? and that &s;he was troubled
with an evil Con&s;cience; told her, if &s;he came to
Sea, and to be in a Storm, if &s;he had lain with
her Ma&s;ter, &s;he wou'd certainly tell her Mi&s;tre&s;s
of it; and that it was a common thing, for poor
Maids to confe&s;s all the Young-Men they had lain
with; that there was one poor Girl that went over
with her Mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e Husband was a&mdash;r,
in&mdash;, in the City of <HI>London,</HI> who con|fe&s;s'd,
<PB N="158" REF="163">
in the Terror of a Storm, that the had lain
with her Ma&s;ter, and all the Apprentices &s;o often,
and in &s;uch and &s;uch Places, and made the poor
Mi&s;tre&s;s, when &s;he return'd to <HI>London,</HI> fly at her
Husband, and make &s;uch a Stir, as was indeed,
the Ruin of the whole Family: <HI>Amy</HI> cou'd bear
all that well enough; for tho' &s;he had indeed,
lain with her Ma&s;ter, it was with her Mi&s;tre&s;s's
Knowledge and Con&s;ent, and which was wor&s;e,
was her Mi&s;tre&s;s's own doing; <HI>I record it to the
Reproach of my own Vice,</HI> and to expo&s;e the Ex|ce&s;&s;es
of &s;uch Wickedne&s;s, as they de&s;erve to be
expos'd.</P>
<P>I thought <HI>Amy</HI>'s Fear would have been over by
that time the Ship would be gotten ready, but I
found the Girl was rather wor&s;e and wor&s;e; and
when I came to the Point, that we mu&s;t go on
Board, or lo&s;e the Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Amy</HI> was &s;o terrified,
that &s;he fell into Fits, &s;o the Ship went away
without us.</P>
<P>But my going being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as
above, I was oblig'd to go in the Packet-Boat
&s;ome time after, and leave <HI>Amy</HI> behind, at <HI>Har|wich,</HI>
but with Directions to go to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;tay
there, to receive Letters and Orders from me what
to do: Now I was become, from a Lady of Plea|&s;ure,
a Woman of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and of great Bu&s;ine&s;s
too, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>I got me a Servant at <HI>Harwich,</HI> to go over with
me, who had been at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> knew the Place,
and &s;poke the Language, which was a great Help
to me, and away I went; I had a very quick Pa&s;|&s;age,
and plea&s;ant Weather, and coming to <HI>Rot|erdam,</HI>
&s;oon found out the Merchant to whom I
was recommended, who receiv'd me with extraor|dinary
Re&s;pect; and fir&s;t he acknowledg'd the ac|cepted
Bill for 4000 Pi&s;toles, which he afterwards
<PB N="159" REF="164">
paid punctually; other Bills that I had al&s;o pay|able
at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> he procur'd to be receiv'd for
me; and whereas one of the Bills for a Thou&s;and
two Hundred Crowns, was prote&s;ted at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI>
he paid it me him&s;elf, for the Honour of the
Endor&s;er, as he call'd it, which was my Friend,
the Merchant at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>There I enter'd into a Negociation, by his
Means, for my Jewels, and he brought me &s;eve|ral
Jewellers, to look on them, and particularly,
one to Value them, and to tell me what every
Particular was worth: This was a Man who had
great Skill in Jewels, but did not Trade at that
time; and he, was de&s;ir'd by the Gentleman that I
was with, to &s;ee that I might not be impos'd
upon.</P>
<P>All this Work took me up near half a Year, and
by managing my Bu&s;ine&s;s thus my&s;elf, and having
large Sums to do with, I became as expert in it,
as any She-Merchant of them all; I had Credit
in the Bank for a large Sum of Money, and Bills
and Notes for much more.</P>
<P>After I had been here about three Months, my
Maid <HI>Amy</HI> writes me word, that &s;he &s;iad receiv'd
a Letter from her Friend, as &s;he call'd him, that,
<HI>by the way,</HI> was the Prince's Gentleman, that had
been, <HI>Amy</HI>'s extraordinary Friend indeed; for <HI>Amy</HI>
own'd to me, he had lain with her a hundred
times; that is to &s;ay, as often as he pleas'd; and
perhaps, in the eight Year which that Affair la&s;t|ed,
it might be a great deal oftner: This was
what &s;he call'd her Friend, who &s;he corre&s;ponded
with upon this particular Subject; and among o|ther
things, &s;ent her this particular News, that
my extraordinary Friend, my real Husband, who
rode in the <HI>Gensd'arms,</HI> was dead; that he was
kill'd in a Rencounter, as they call it, or acciden|tal
<PB N="160" REF="165">
Scuffle among the Troopers; and &s;o the Jade
congratulated me upon my being now a real Free|Woman;
and now Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he, at the End of
her Letter,</HI> you have nothing to do but to come hi|th$r,
and &s;et up a Coach, and a good Equipage;
and if Beauty and a good Fortune won't make you
a Dutche&s;s, nothing will; <HI>but I had not fix'd my
Mea&s;ures yet;</HI> I had no Inclination to be a Wife
again, I had had &s;uch bad Luck with my fir&s;t
Husband, I hated the Thoughts of it; I found,
that a Wife is treated with Indifference, a Mi|&s;tre&s;s
with a &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion; a Wife is look'd up|on,
as but an Upper-Servant, a Mi&s;tre&s;s is a So|vereign;
a Wife mu&s;t give up all &s;he has; have
every Re&s;erve &s;he makes for her&s;elf, be thought
hard of, and be upbraided with her very <HI>Pin-Mo|ney;</HI>
whereas a Mi&s;tre&s;s makes the Saying true,
<HI>that what the Man has,</HI> is hers, and <HI>what &s;he has,</HI> is
her own; the Wife bears a thou&s;and In&s;ults, and
is forc'd to &s;it &s;till and bear it, or part and be un|done;
a Mi&s;tre&s;s in&s;ulted, helps her&s;elf immedi|ately,
and takes another.</P>
<P>The&s;e were my wicked Arguments for Whoring,
for I never &s;et again&s;t them the Difference ano|ther
way, I may &s;ay, every other way; <HI>how that,</HI>
FIRST, A Wife appears boldly and honourably
with her Husband; lives at Home, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
his Hou&s;e, his Servants, his Equipages, and has
a Right to them all, and to call them her own;
entertains his Friends, owns his Children, and
has the return of Duty and Affection from them,
as they are here her own, and claims upon his
E&s;tate, by the Cu&s;tom of <HI>England,</HI> if he dies,
and leaves her a Widow.</P>
<P>The Whore &s;culks about in Lodgings; is vi|&s;ited
in the dark; di&s;own'd upon all Occa&s;ions, be|fore
God and Man; is maintain'd indeed, for a
<PB N="161" REF="166">
time; but is certainly condemn'd to be abandon'd
at la&s;t, and left, to the Mi&s;eries of Fate, and her
own ju&s;t Di&s;a&s;ter: If &s;he has any Children, her
Endeavour is to get rid of them, and not main|tain
them; and if &s;he lives, &s;he is certain to &s;ee
them all hate her, and be a&s;ham'd of her; while
the Vice rages, and the Man is in the Devil's
Hand, <HI>&s;he has him,</HI> and while &s;he has him, &s;he
makes <HI>a Prey of him;</HI> but if he happens to fall
Sick; if any Di&s;a&s;ter befals him, the Cau&s;e of all
lies upon her; he is &s;ure to lay all his Misfor|tunes
at her Door; and if once he comes to Re|pentance,
or makes but one Step towards a Refor|mation,
he begins with her; leaves her; u&s;es her
as &s;he de&s;erves, hates her; abhors her; and <HI>&s;ees
her no more;</HI> and that with this never-failing Ad|dition,
namely, That the more &s;incere and un|feign'd
his Repentance is, the more earne&s;tly he
looks up; and the more effectually he looks in,
the more his Aver&s;ion to her, encrea&s;es; and he
cur&s;es her from the Bottom of his Soul; nay,
it mu&s;t be from a kind of Exce&s;s of Charity,
if he &s;o much as wi&s;hes God may forgive her.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ite Circum&s;tances of a <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Whore,</HI>
are &s;uch, and &s;o many, and I have &s;ince &s;een the
Difference with &s;uch Eyes, as I cou'd dwelL upon
the Subject a great-while; but my Bu&s;ine&s;s is Hi|&s;tory;
I had a long Scene of Folly yet to run
over; perhaps the Moral of all my Story may
bring me back-again to this Part, and if it does,
I &s;hall &s;peak of it fally.</P>
<P>While I continued in <HI>Holland,</HI> I receiv'd &s;everal
Letters from my Friend, (&s;o I had good Rea&s;on
to call him) the Merchant in <HI>Paris;</HI> in which he
gave me a farther Account o$ the Conduct of that
Rogue, the <HI>Jew,</HI> and how he acted after I was gone;
how Impatient he was while the &s;aid Merchant
<PB N="162" REF="167">
kept him in &s;u&s;pence, expecting me to come again;
and how he rag'd when he found I came no more.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, after he found I did not come, he
found out, by his unweary'd Enquiry, where I had
liv'd; and that I had been kept as a Mi&s;tre&s;s, by
&s;ome Great Per&s;on, but he cou'd never learn by
who, except that, he learnt the Colour of his
Livery; in Pur&s;uit of this Enquiry, he gue&s;s'd
aa the right Per&s;on, but cou'd not make it out,
or offer any po&s;itive Proof of it; but he found
out the Prince's Gentleman, and talk'd &s;o &s;aucily
to him of it, that the Gentleman treated him, as
the <HI>French</HI> call it, <HI>au Coup de Barton;</HI> that is to &s;ay,
Can'd him very &s;everely, as he de&s;erv'd; and
that not &s;atisfying him, or curing his In&s;olence,
he was met one Night late, upon the <HI>Pont Neuf</HI>
in <HI>Paris,</HI> by two Men, who muffling him up in
a great Cloak, carried him into a more private
Place, and cut off both his Ears, telling him, It
was for talking impudently of his Superiours; ad|ding,
that he &s;hou'd take Care to govern his
Tongue better, and behave with more Manners,
or the next time they would cut his Tongue out
of his Head.</P>
<P>This put a Check to his Saucine&s;s that Way;
but he comes back to the Merchant, and threat|ned
to begin a Proce&s;s again&s;t him, for corre&s;|ponding
with me, and being acce&s;&s;ary to the
Murther of the Jeweller, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchant found by his Di&s;cour&s;e, that
he &s;uppos'd I was protected by the &s;aid Prince
<HI>de</HI>&mdash;, nay, the Rogue &s;aid, he was &s;ure I
was in his Lodgings at <HI>Ver&s;ailies; for he never had
&s;o much as the lea&s;t Intimation of the Way I was really
gone;</HI> but that I was there, he was certain, and
certain that the Merchant was privy to it: The
Merchant bade him Defiance; however, he gave
<PB N="163" REF="168">
him a great deal of Trouble, and put him to a
great Charge, and had like to have brought him
in for a Party to my E&s;cape, in which Ca&s;e, he
wou'd have been oblig'd, to have produc'd me,
and that in the Penalty of &s;ome capital Sum of
Money.</P>
<P>But the Merchant was too-many for him ano|ther
Way; for he brought an Information again&s;t
him for a Cheat; wherein, laying down the whole
Fact, How he intended-fal&s;ly to accu&s;e the Wi|dow
of the Jeweller, for the &s;uppos'd Murther of
her Husband; that he did it purely to get the
Jewels from her; and that he offer'd to bring him
[<HI>the Merchant</HI>] in, to be Confederate with him,
and to &s;hare the Jewels between them; proving
al&s;o, his De&s;ign to get the Jewels into his Hands,
and then to have dropp'd the Pro&s;ecution, up|on
Condition of my quitting the Jewels to him;
upon this Charge, he got him laid by the Heels;
&s;o he was &s;ent to the <HI>Concergerie,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to
<HI>Bridewell,</HI> and the Merchant clear'd: He got out
of Jayl in a little-while, tho' not without the
help of Money, and continued teizing the Mer|chant
a long while and at la&s;t threatning to a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inate
and murther him; &s;o the Merchant, who
having b$ried his Wife about two Months before,
was now a &s;ingle Man, and not knowing what
&s;uch a Villain might do, thought fit to quit <HI>Paris,</HI>
and came away to <HI>Holland</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that &s;peaking of Originals, I
was the Source and Spring of all that Trouble and
Vexation to this hone&s;t Gentleman; and as it
was afterwards in my Power to have made him
full Satisfaction, and did not, I cannot &s;ay but I
added Ingratitude to all the re&s;t of my Follies;
but of that I &s;hall give a fuller Account pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="169">
I was &s;urpriz'd one Morning, when being at
the Merchant's Hou&s;e, who he had recommended
me to, in <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and being bu&s;ie in his Coun|ting-Hou&s;e,
managing my Bills, and preparing to
write a Letter to him, to <HI>Paris,</HI> I heard a Noi&s;e
of Hor&s;es at the Door; which is not very com|mon
in a City, where every-body pa&s;&s;es by Wa|ter;
but he had, it &s;eems, ferry'd over the <HI>Maez</HI>
from <HI>William&s;tadt,</HI> and &s;o came to the very Door;
and I looking towards the Door, upon hearing the
Hor&s;es, &s;aw a Gentleman alight, and come in
at the Gate, I knew nothing, and expected no|thing,
to be &s;ure, of the Per&s;on; but, as I &s;ay,
was &s;urpriz'd, and indeed, more than ordinarily
&s;urpriz'd, when coming nearer to me, I &s;aw it was
my Merchant of <HI>Paris;</HI> my Benefactor; and in|deed,
my Deliverer.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, it was an agreeable Surprize to me,
and I was exceeding glad to &s;ee him, who was
&s;o honourable, and &s;o kind to me, and who in|deed,
had &s;av'd my Life: As &s;oon as he &s;aw me,
he run to me, took me in his Arms, and ki&s;s'd
me, with a Freedom that he never offer'd to take
with me before; <HI>Dear Madam</HI>&mdash;, &s;ays he, <HI>I
am glad to &s;ee you &s;afe in this Country; if you had
&s;tay'd two Days longer iu</HI> Paris, <HI>you had been uudone:</HI>
I was &s;o glad to &s;ee him, that, I cou'd not &s;peak
a good-while, and I bur&s;t out into Tears, with|out
&s;peaking a Word for a Minute; but I reco|ver'd
that Di&s;order, and &s;aid, <HI>The more,</HI> Sir, <HI>is my
Obligation to you, that &s;av'd my Life;</HI> and added,
<HI>I am glad to &s;ee you here, that I may con&s;ider how to
ballance an Account, in which I am &s;o much your
Debtor.</HI></P>
<P>You and I will adju&s;t that Matter ea&s;ily, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> now we are &s;o near together; pray where do
you Lodge? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="170">
In a very hone&s;t good Hou&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> where
that Gentleman, your Friend, recommended me;
pointing to the Merchant in whole Hou&s;e we then
were.</P>
<P>And where you may Lodge too, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the
Gentleman,</HI> if it &s;uits with your Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
your other Conveniency.</P>
<P>With-all my Heart, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> then Madam, <HI>adds
he,</HI> turning to me, I &s;hall be near you, and have
Time to tell you a Story, which will be very
long, and yet many ways very plea&s;ant to you,
how trouble&s;ome that devili&s;h Fellow, the <HI>Jew,</HI>
has been to me, on your Account; and what a
helli&s;h Snare he had laid for you, if he cou'd
have found you,</P>
<P>I &s;hall have Lei&s;ure too, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> to tell you
all my Adventures &s;ince that; which have not
been a few, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he took up his Lodgings in the &s;ame
Hou&s;e where I lodg'd, and the Room he lay in,
open'd as he was wi&s;hing it wou'd, ju&s;t oppo|&s;ite
to my Lodging-Room; &s;o we cou'd almo&s;t
call out of Bed to one another, and I was not at|all
&s;hy of him on that Score, for I believ'd him
perfectly hone&s;t, and &s;o indeed, he was; and if
he had not, that Article was at pre&s;nt, no Part
of my Concern.</P>
<P>It was not till two or three Days, and after his
fir&s;t Hurries of Bu&s;ine&s;s were over, that we began
to enter into the Hi&s;tory of our Affairs on every
&s;ide, but when we began, it took up all our Con|ver&s;ation,
for almo&s;t a Fortnight: Fir&s;t, I gave
him a particular Account of every thing that
happen'd material upon my Voyage; and how
we were driven into <HI>Harwich</HI> by a very terri$le
Storm; how I had left my Woman behind me,
&s;o frighted with the Danger &s;he had been in, that
<PB N="166" REF="171">
&s;he dor&s;t not venture to &s;et her Foot into a Ship
again, any more; and that I had not come my &s;elf,
if the Bills I had of him, had not been payable
in <HI>Holland;</HI> but that Money, he might &s;ee, wou'd
make a Woman go any-where.</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd to laugh at all our womani&s;h Fears
upon the Occa&s;ion of the Storm; telling me, it
was nothing but what was very ordinary in tho&s;e
Seas; but that they had Harbours on every Coa&s;t,
&s;o near, that they were &s;eldom in Danger of be|ing
lo&s;t indeed; for, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if they cannot fetch
one Coa&s;t, they can always &s;tand away for ano|ther,
and run afore it, <HI>as he call'd it,</HI> for one &s;ide
or or other: But when I came to tell him what
a crazy Ship it was, and how, even when they
got into <HI>Harwich,</HI> and into &s;mooth Water, they
were fain to run the Ship on Shore, or &s;he wou'd
have &s;unk in the very Harbour; and when I told
him, that when I look'd out at the Cabin-Door,
I &s;aw the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> one upon his Knees here,
and another there, at their Prayers, then indeed,
he acknowledg'd I had rea&s;on to be alarm'd; but
&s;miling, <HI>he added,</HI> But you, Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> are
&s;o good a Lady, and &s;o pious, you wou'd but
have gone to Heaven a little the &s;ooner, the Dif|ference
had not been much to you.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, when he &s;aid this, it made all the
Blood turn in my Veins, and I thought I &s;hou'd
have fainted; poor Gentleman! thought I, you
know little of me; what wou'd I give to be really
what you really think me to be! He perceiv'd the
Di&s;order, but &s;aid nothing till I &s;poke; when
&s;haking my Head, <HI>O Sir!</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>Death in any
Shape has &s;ome Terror in it;</HI> but in the frightful Fi|gure
of a Storm at Sea, and a &s;inking, Ship, it
comes with a double, a trebble, and indeed, an
inexpre&s;&s;ible Horrour; and if I were that Saint
<PB N="167" REF="172">
you think me to be, which, God knows, I am
not, 'tis &s;till very di&s;mal; I de&s;ire to die in a
Calm, if I can: He &s;aid a great many good things,
and very prettily order'd, his Di&s;cour&s;e, between
&s;erious Reflection and Compliment; but I had
too much Guilt to reli&s;h it as it was meant, &s;o
I turn'd it off to &s;omething el&s;e, and talk'd of the
Nece&s;&s;ity I had on me to come to <HI>Holland;</HI> but
I wi&s;h'd my&s;elf &s;afe on Shore in <HI>England</HI> again.</P>
<P>He told me, he was glad I had &s;uch an Obli|gation
upon me to come over into <HI>Holland,</HI> how|ever;
but hinted, that he was &s;o intere&s;ted in
my Wellfare, and be&s;ides, had &s;uch, farther
De&s;igns upon me, that if I had not &s;o happily
been found in <HI>Holland,</HI> he was re&s;olv'd to have
gone to <HI>England</HI> to &s;ee me; and that it was one
of the principal Rea&s;ons of his leaving <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, I was extremely oblig'd to him for
&s;o far intere&s;ting him&s;elf in my Affairs; but that
I had been &s;o far his Debtor before, that I knew
not how any thing could encrea&s;e the Debt; for
I ow'd my Life to him already, and I could not
be in Debt for any-thing more valuable than
that.</P>
<P>He an&s;wer'd in the mo&s;t obliging Manner po&s;|&s;ible,
that he wou'd put it in my Power to pay that
Debt, and all the Obligations be&s;ides, that ever he
had, or &s;hould be able to lay upon me.</P>
<P>I began to under&s;tand him now, and to &s;ee
plainly, that he re&s;olv'd to <HI>make Love to me;</HI> but
I would by no means &s;eem to take the Hint, and
be&s;ides I knew that he had a Wife with him in
<HI>Paris;</HI> and I had, <HI>ju&s;t then, at lea&s;t,</HI> no Gu&s;t to any
more intriguing; however, he &s;urpriz'd me into
a &s;udden Notice of the thing a little-while after,
by &s;aying &s;omething in his Di&s;cour&s;e, that he did
<HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> in his Wife's Days; I &s;tarted at that
<PB N="168" REF="173">
Word; <HI>What mean you by that?</HI> Sir, &s;aid I; <HI>Have
you $word$ a Wife at</HI> Paris? No, Madam, indeed,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my Wife died the beginning of <HI>September</HI>
la&s;t; which, it &s;eems, was but a little after I came
away.</P>
<P>We liv'd in the &s;ame Hou&s;e all this while;
and as we lodg'd not far off of one-another, Op|portunities
were not wanting of as near an Ac|quaintance
as we might de&s;ire; nor have &s;uch
Opportunities the lea&s;t Agency in vicious Minds,
to bring to pa&s;s even what they might not intend
it fir&s;t.</P>
<P>However, tho' he courted &s;o much at a di|&s;tance,
yet his Preten&s;ions were very honourable;
and as I had before found him a mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;t|ed
Friend, and perfectly hone&s;t in his Dealings,
even when I tru&s;ted him with all I had; &s;o now
I found him &s;trictly virtuous, till I made him o|therwi&s;e
my&s;elf even almo&s;t, whether he wou'd
or no; as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>It was not long after our former Di&s;cour&s;e,
when he repeated what he had in&s;inuated before,
namely, that he had yet a De&s;ign to lay before
me, which, it I wou'd agree to his Propo&s;als,
wou'd more than ballance all Accounts between
us: I told him, I cou'd not rea&s;onably deny him
any-thing; and <HI>except one things, which I hop'd and
believ'd he wou'd not think of,</HI> I &s;hould think my|&s;elf
very ungrateful if I did not do every thing for
him that lay in my Power.</P>
<P>He told me, what he &s;hould de&s;ire of me, wou'd
be fully in my Power to grant, or el&s;e he &s;hou'd
be very unfriendly to offer it, and &s;till, all this
while, he declin'd making the Propo&s;al, <HI>as he call'd
it,</HI> and &s;o, for that time, we ended our Di&s;cour&s;e,
turning it off to other things; &s;o that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I
began to think he might have met with &s;ome Di|&s;a&s;ter
<PB N="169" REF="174">
in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and might have come a|way
from <HI>Paris</HI> in &s;ome Di&s;credit; or had had
&s;ome Blow on his Affairs in general; and as really
I had Kindne&s;s enough to have parted with a
good Sum to have help'd him, and was in Grati|tude,
bound to have done &s;o, <HI>he having &s;o effectually
&s;av'd to me all I had;</HI> &s;o I re&s;olv'd to make him
the Offer, the fir&s;t time I had an Opportunity,
which, two or three Days after, offer'd it&s;elf, ve|ry
much to my Satisfaction.</P>
<P>He had told me at large, <HI>tho' on &s;everal Occa|&s;ions,</HI>
the Treatment he had met with from the
<HI>Jew,</HI> and what Expence he had put him to; how
at length he had ca&s;t him, <HI>as above,</HI> and had re|cover'd
good Damage of him, but that the Rogue
was unable to make him any con&s;iderable Repa|ration;
he had told me al&s;o, how the Prince <HI>d'&mdash;'s</HI>
Gentleman had re&s;ented his Treatment
of his Ma&s;ter; and how he had caus'd him to be
us'd upon the <HI>Pont Neuf,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>as I have mention'd
above;</HI> which I laugh'd at mo&s;t heartily.</P>
<P>It is pity, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that I &s;hould &s;it here, and
make that Gentleman no Amends; if you wou'd
direct me, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> how to do it, I wou'd
make him a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent, and acknowledge
the Ju&s;tice he had done to me, as well as to the
Prince, his Ma&s;ter: He &s;aid he wou'd do what
I directed in it; &s;o I told him, I would &s;end him
500 Crowns; <HI>chat's too much,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for you are
but half intere&s;ted in the &V;&s;age of the</HI> Jew; <HI>it was
on his Ma&s;ter's Account he corrected him, not on yours:</HI>
Well, however, we were oblig'd, to do nothing in
it, for neither of us knew how to dirct a Letter
to him, or to direct any-body to him; &s;o I told
him, I wou'd leave it till I came to <HI>England,</HI> for
that my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> corre&s;ponded with him,
and that he had made Love to her.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="175">
Well, but Sir. <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> as in requital for his ge|nerous
Concern for me, I am careful to think of
him; it is but ju&s;t, that what Expence you have
been oblig'd to be at, which was all on my Ac|count,
&s;hou'd be repaid you; and therefore, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI>
let me &s;ee&mdash;<HI>and there I paus'd,</HI> and began to rec|kon
up what I had ob&s;erv'd from his own Di&s;|cour&s;e,
it had co&s;t him in the &s;everal Di&s;putes,
and Hearings, which he had with that <HI>Dog</HI> of a
<HI>Jew,</HI> and I ca&s;t them up at &s;omething above 2130
Crowns; &s;o I pull'd out &s;ome Bills which I had
upon a Merchant in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and a particular
Account in Bank, and was looking on them, in
order to give them to him.</P>
<P>When he &s;eeing evidently what I was going a|bout,
interrupted me with &s;ome Warmth, and told
me, he wou'd have nothing of me on that Ac|count,
and de&s;ir'd I wou'd not pull out my Bills
and Papers on that Score; that he had not told
me the Story on that Account, or with any &s;uch
View; that it had been his Misfortune fir&s;t to
bring <HI>that ugly Rogue</HI> to me, which, tho' it was
with a good De&s;ign, yet he wou'd puni&s;h him&s;elf
with the Expence he had been at, for his being
&s;o unlucky to me; that I cou'd not think &s;o hard
of him, as to &s;uppo&s;e he wou'd take Money of
me, <HI>a Widow,</HI> for &s;erving me, and doing Acts of
Kindne&s;s to me in a &s;trange Country, and in Di|&s;tre&s;s
too; but, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he wou'd repeat what he
had &s;aid before, that he kept me for a deeper Rec|koning,
and that, as he had told me, he would
put me into a Po&s;ture to Even all that Favour,
as I call'd it, <HI>at once,</HI> &s;o we &s;hou'd talk it over ano|ther
time, and ballance all together.</P>
<P>Now I expected it wou'd come out, but &s;till he
put it off, as before, from whence I concluded, it
cou'd not be Matter of <HI>Love,</HI> for that tho&s;e things
<PB N="171" REF="176">
are not u&s;ually delay'd in &s;uch a manner, and
therefore it mu&s;t be Matter of Money; upon
which Thought, I broke the Silence, and told him,
that as he knew I had, by Obligation, more Kind|ne&s;s
for him, than to deny any Favour to him that
I could grant, and that he &s;eem'd backward to
mention his Ca&s;e; I begg'd Leave of him to give
me Leave to ask him, whether any-thing lay up|on
his Mind, with re&s;pect to his Bu&s;ine&s;s and Ef|fects
in the World? that if it did, he knew what
I had in the World, as well as I did; and that if
he wanted Money, I wou'd let him have any Sum
for his Occa&s;ion as far as five or &s;ix Thou&s;and
Pi&s;toles, and he &s;hou'd pay me as his own Affairs
wou'd permit; and that, if he never paid me, I
wou'd a &s;&s;ure him, that I wou'd never give him
any Trouble for it.</P>
<P>He ri&s;e up with Ceremony, and gave me Thanks,
in Terms that &s;ufficiently told me, he had been
bred among People more polite, and more courte|ons,
than is e&s;teem'd the ordinary U&s;age of the
Dutch; and after his Compliment was over, he
came nearer to me, and told me, that he was o|blig'd
to a&s;&s;ure me, tho' with repeated Acknow|lodgments
of my kind Offer, that he was not in
any want of Money; that he had met with no
Unea&s;ine&s;s in any of his Affairs, no not of any
Kind whatever, except that of the Lo&s;s of his
Wife, and one of his Children, which indeed,
had troubled him much; but that this was no Part
of what he had to offer to me, and by granting
which, I &s;hou'd ballance all Obligations; but that,
in &s;hort, it was that &s;eeing Providence had (as
it were for that Purpo&s;e) taken his Wife from
him, I wou'd make up the Lo&s;s to him; and
with, that, he held me fa&s;t in his Arms, and ki&s;|&s;ing
me, wou'd not give me Leave to &s;ay No,
and hardly to Breathe.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="177">
At length, having got room to &s;peak, I told
him, that, as I had &s;aid before, I could deny
him but one thing in the World; I was very &s;or|ry
he &s;hou'd propo&s;e <HI>that thing only</HI> that I cou'd
not grant.</P>
<P>I could not but &s;mile however, to my&s;elf, that
he &s;hou'd make &s;o many Circles, and round-about
Motions, to come at a Di&s;cour&s;e which had no
&s;uch rarity at the Bottom of it, if he had known
all: Put there was another Rea&s;on why I re&s;olv'd
not to have him, when, at the &s;ame time, if he
Bad courted me in a Manner le&s;s hone&s;t or virtu|ous,
I believe I &s;hou'd not have denied him; but
I &s;hall come to that Part pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>He was, as I have &s;aid, long a-bringing it out,
but when he had brought it out, he pur&s;ued it
with &s;uch Importunities, as would admit of no De|nial,
<HI>at lea&s;t he intended they &s;hou'd not;</HI> but I re|&s;i&s;ted
them ob&s;tinately, and yet with Expre&s;&s;ions
of the utmo&s;t Kindne&s;s and Re&s;pect for him that
cou'd be imagin'd, often telling him, there was
nothing el&s;e in the World that I cou'd deny him,
and &s;hewing him all the Re&s;pect, and upon all Oc|ca&s;ions
treating him with Intimacy and Freedom,
as if he had been my Brother.</P>
<P>He tried all the Ways imaginable to bring his
De&s;ign to pa&s;s, but I was inflexible; at la&s;t, he
thought of a Way, which, he flatter'd him&s;elf
wou'd not fail; nor would he have been mi&s;taken
perhaps, in any other Woman in the World, <HI>but
me;</HI> this was, to try if he cou'd take me at an Ad|vantage,
and get to-Bed to me, and then, <HI>as was
mo&s;t rational to think,</HI> I &s;hould willingly enough
marry him afterwards.</P>
<P>We were &s;o intimate together, that nothing but
Man and Wife could, or at lea&s;t ought to be, more;
but &s;till our Freedoms kept within the Bounds of
<PB N="173" REF="178">
Mode&s;ty and Decency; But one Evening, above
all the re&s;t, we were very merry, and I fancy'd he
pu&s;h'd the Mirth to watch for his Advantage;
and I re&s;olv'd that I wou'd, at lea&s;t, feign to be
as merry as he; and that, in &s;hort, if he offer'd
any-thing, he &s;hou'd have his Will ea&s;ily enough.</P>
<P>About One a-Clock in the Morning, for &s;o long
we &s;at-up together, I &s;aid, <HI>Come,</HI> 'tis One a-Clock,
<HI>I mu&s;t go to-Bed; Well,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I'll go with you;</HI>
No, No, &s;ays I, <HI>go to your own Chamber;</HI> he &s;aid
he wou'd go to-Bed with me: <HI>Nay,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>if you
will,</HI> I don't know what to &s;ay; <HI>if I can't help it,
you mu&s;t:</HI> However, I got from him, left him, and
went into my Chamber, but did not &s;hut the
Door; and as he cou'd ea&s;ily &s;ee that I was un|dre&s;&s;ing
my&s;elf, he &s;teps to his own Room, which
was but on the &s;ame Floor, and in a few Minutes
undre&s;&s;es him&s;elf al&s;o and returns to my Door in
his Gown and Slippers.</P>
<P>I thought he had been gone indeed, and &s;o that
he had been in je&s;t; and by the way, thought either
he had no-mind to the thing, or that he never
intended it; &s;o I &s;hut my Door, that is, latch'd
it, for I &s;eldom lock'd or bolted it, and went to-Bed;
I had not been in-Bed a Minute, but he
comes in his Gown, to the Door, and opens it a
little-way, but not enough to come in, or look in,
and &s;ays &s;oftly, What are you really gone to-Bed?
<HI>Yes, yes,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>get you gone:</HI> No indeed, &s;ays he,
<HI>I &s;hall not begone, you gave me Leave before, to come
to-Bed and you &s;han't &s;ay get you gone now:</HI> So he
comes into my Room, and then turns about, and
fa&s;tens the Door, and immediately comes to the
Bed-&s;ide to me: I pretended, to &s;cold and &s;truggle,
and bid him begone, with more Warmth than be|fore;
but it was all one; he had not a Rag of
Cloaths on, but his Gown and Slippers, and Shirt;
<PB N="174" REF="179">
&s;o he throws off his Gown, and throws open the
Bed, and came in at once.</P>
<P>I made a &s;eeming Re&s;i&s;tance, but it was no more
indeed; for, <HI>as above,</HI> I re&s;olv'd from the Begin|ning,
he &s;hou'd Lye with me if he wou'd, and
for the re&s;t, I left it to come after.</P>
<P>Well he lay with me that Night, and the two
next, and very merry we were all the three Days
between; but the third Night he began to be a
little more grave: Now, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> tho'
I have pu&s;h'd this Matter farther than ever I in|tended;
or than, I believe, you expected from me,
who never made any Pretences to you but what
were very hone&s;t; yet to heal it all up, and let
you &s;ee how &s;incerely I meant at fir&s;t, and how
hone&s;t I will ever be to you, I am ready to mar|ry
you &s;till, and de&s;ire you no let it be done to|Morrow
Morning; and I will give you the &s;ame
fair Conditions of Marriage as I wou't have done
before.</P>
<P>This, it mu&s;t be own'd, was a Te&s;timony that
he was very hone&s;t, and that he lov'd me &s;incere|ly;
but I con&s;trued it quite another Way, name|ly;
that he aim'd at the Money: But how &s;ur|priz'd
did he look! and how was he confounded,
when he &s;o found me receive his propo&s;al with, Cold|ne&s;s
and Indifference! and &s;till tell him, that it
was the <HI>only thing</HI> I cou'd not grant!</P>
<P>He was a&s;toni&s;h'd! What, not take me now!
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> when I have been a-Bed with you! I an|&s;wer'd
coldly, tho' re&s;pectfully &s;till, <HI>It is true,</HI> to
my Shame be it &s;poken, &s;ays I, <HI>that you have ta|ken
me by Surprize, and have had your Will of me;
but I hope you will not take it ill that I cannot con&s;ent
to Marry, for-all that; if I am with-Child,</HI> &s;aid I,
<HI>Care mu&s;t be taken to manage that as you &s;hall direct;
I hope you won't expo&s;e me for my having expos'd my|&s;elf
<PB N="175" REF="180">
to you, but I cannot go any farther;</HI> and at that
Point I &s;tood, and wou'd hear of no Matrimony,
by any means.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e this may &s;eem a little odd, I &s;hall
&s;tate the Matter clearly, as I under&s;tood it my|&s;elf;
I knew that while I was Mi&s;tre&s;s, it is
cu&s;tomary for the Per&s;on kept; to receive from
them that keep; but if I &s;hou'd be a Wife, all
I had then, was given up to the Husband, and
I was thenceforth to be under his Authority on|ly;
and as I had Money enough, and needed not
fear being what they call <HI>a ca&s;t-off Mi&s;tre&s;e,</HI> &s;o I
had no need to give him twenty Thou&s;and Pound
to marry me, which had been buying my Lodging
too dear a great deal.</P>
<P>Thus his Project of coming to-Bed to me, was
a Bite upon him&s;elf, while he intended, it for a
Bite upon me; and he was no nearer his Aim of
marrying me, than he was before; all his Argu|ments
he could urge upon the Subject of Matri|mony,
were at an Fnd, for I po&s;itively declin'd
marrying him; and as he had refus'd the thou|&s;and
Pi&s;toles which I had offer'd him in Compen|&s;ation
for his Expences and Lo&s;s, at <HI>Paris,</HI> with
the <HI>Jew,</HI> and had done it upon the Hopes he had
of marrying me; &s;o when he found his Way
difficult &s;till, he was amaz'd, and, I had &s;ome
Rea&s;on to believe, repented that he had refus'd
the Money.</P>
<P>But thus it is when Men run into wicked Mea|&s;ures,
to bring their De&s;igns about; I that was in|finitely
oblig'd, to him before, began to talk to
him, as if I had ballanc'd Accounts with him
now; and that the Favour of $ying with a Whore,
was equal, not to the thou&s;and Pi&s;toles only, but
to all the Debt I ow'd him, for &s;aving my Life,
and all my Effects.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="181">
But he drew him&s;elf into it, and tho' it was
a dear Bargain, yet it was a Bargain of his own
making he cou'd not &s;ay I had trick'd him into
it; but as he projected and drew me in to lye
with him, depending that it was a &s;ure Game in
order to a Marriage, &s;o I granted him the Fa|vour,
as he call'd it, to ballance the Account of
Favours receiv'd from him, and keep the thou&s;and
Pi&s;toles with a good Grace.</P>
<P>He was extremely di&s;appointed in this Article,
and knew not how to manage for a great-while;
and as I dare &s;ay, if he had not expected to have
made it an Earne&s;t for marrying me, he would
never have attempted me the other way; &s;o, I
believ'd, if it had not been for the Money, which
he knew I had, he wou'd never have de&s;ir'd
to marry me after he had lain with me: For,
where is the Man that cares to marry a Whore, tho'
of his own making? And as I knew him to be
no Fool, &s;o I did him no Wrong, when I &s;up|pos'd
that, but for the Money, he wou'd not
have had any Thoughts of me that Way; e&s;pe|cially
after my yielding as I had done; in which
it is to be remember'd, that I made no Capitula|tion
for marrying him, when I yielded to him,
but let him do ju&s;t what he pleas'd, without any
previous Bargain.</P>
<P>Well, hitherto we went upon Gue&s;&s;es at one-another's
De&s;igns but as he continued to impor|tune
me to marry, tho' he had lain with me,
and &s;till did lye with me as often as he pleas'd,
and I continued to refu&s;e to marry him, tho'
I let him lye with me whenever de de&s;ir'd it; I
&s;ay, as the&s;e two Circum&s;tances made up our
Conver&s;ation, it cou'd not continue long thus, but
we mu&s;t come to an Explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="182">
One Morning, in the middle of our unlawful,
Freedoms, that is to &s;ay, when we were in Bed
together; he &s;igh'd, and told me, he de&s;ir'd my
Leave to ask me one Que&s;tion, and that I wou'd
give him an An&s;wer to it with the &s;ame ingenu|ous
Freedom and Hone&s;ty, that I had us'd to treat
him with; I told him I wou'd: Why then his
Que&s;tion was, why I wou'd not marry him, &s;eeing
I allow'd him all the Freedom of a Husband? <HI>Or,
&s;ays he,</HI> my Dear, <HI>&s;ince you have been &s;o kind as to
take me to your Bed, why will you not make me
your Own, and take me for good-and-all,</HI> that we
may enjoy our&s;elves, <HI>without any Reproach to one-another?</HI></P>
<P>I told him, that as I confe&s;s'd it was the
only thing I cou'd not comply with him in, &s;o it
was the only thing in all my Actions, that I could
not give him a Rea&s;on for; that it was true, I had
let him come to-Bed to me, which was &s;uppos'd
to be the greate&s;t Favour a Woman could grant;
but it was evident, and he might &s;ee it, that as I
was &s;en&s;ible of the Obligation I was under to him,
for &s;aving me from the wor&s;t Circum&s;tance it was
po&s;&s;ible for me to be brought to, I could deny
him nothing; and if I had had any greater Fa|vour
to yield him, I &s;hould have done it, <HI>that of
Matrimony only excepted,</HI> and he cou'd not but &s;ee
that I lov'd him to an extraordinary Degree, in
every Part of my Behaviour to him; but that
as to marrying, which was giving up my Liberty,
it was what once he knew I had done, and he had
&s;een how it had hurried me up and down in the
World, and what it had expos'd me to; that I
had an Aver&s;ion to it, and de&s;ir'd he wou'd not
in&s;i&s;t upon it he might ea&s;ily &s;ee I had no A|ver&s;ion
to him; and that if I was with-Child by
him, he &s;hou'd &s;ee a Te&s;timony of my Kindne&s;s
<PB N="178" REF="183">
to the Father, for that I wou'd &s;ettle all I had in
the World upon the Child.</P>
<P>He was mute a good-while; at la&s;t, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
Come, my Dear, you are the fir&s;t Woman in the
World that ever lay with a Man, and then refus'd
to marry him, and therefore there mu&s;t be &s;ome o|ther
Rea&s;on for your Refu&s;al; and I have therefore,
One other Reque&s;t, and that is, If I gue&s;s at the true
Rea&s;on, and remove the Objection, will you then
yield to me? I told him, if he remov'd the Ob|jection,
I mu&s;t needs comply, for I &s;hou'd cer|tainly
do every-thing that I had no Objection
again&s;t.</P>
<P>Why then, my Dear, it mu&s;t be, that either
you are already engag'd, and marry'd to &s;ome o|ther
Man, or you are not willing to di&s;po&s;e of
your Money to me, and expect to advance your|&s;elf
higher with your Fortune; now, if it be the
fir&s;t of the&s;e, my Mouth will be &s;topp'd, and I
have no more to &s;ay; but if it be the la&s;t, I am
prepar'd effectually to remove the Objection, and
an&s;wer all you can &s;ay on that Subject.</P>
<P>I took him up &s;hort at the fir&s;t of the&s;e; tel|ling
him, He mu&s;t have ba&s;e Thoughts of me
indeed, to think that I could yield to him in &s;uch
a Manner as I had done, and continue it with &s;o
much Freedom, as he found I did, if I had a
Husband, or were engag'd to any other Man; and
that he might depend upon it, that was not my
Ca&s;e, nor any Part of my Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> as to the other, I have an
Offer to make to you, that &s;hall take off all the
Objection, <HI>viz.</HI> That I will not touch one Pi&s;tole
of your E&s;tate, more, than &s;hall be with your
own voluntary Con&s;ent; neither now, or at any
other time, but you &s;hall &s;ettle it as you plea&s;e,
for your Life, and upon who you plea&s;e after your
<PB N="179" REF="184">
Death; that I &s;hou'd &s;ee he was able to maintain
me without it; and that it was not for that,
that he follow'd me from <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I was indeed, &s;urpriz'd at that Part of his Of|fer,
and he might ea&s;ily perceive it; it was not
only what I did not expect, but it was what I
knew not what An&s;wer to make to: He had in|deed,
remodv'd my principal Objection, nay, all
my Objections, and it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to
give any An&s;wer; for if upon &s;o generous an
Offer I &s;hou'd agree with him, I then did
as good as confe&s;s, that it was upon the Ac|count
of my Money that I refus'd him; and that
tho' I cou'd give up my Virtue, and expo&s;e my|&s;elf,
yet I wou'd not give up my Money, which,
tho' it was true, yet was really too gro&s;s for me
to acknowledge, and I cou'd not pretend to mar|ry
him upon that Principle neither; then as to
having him, and make over all my E&s;tate out of
his Hands, to us not to give him the Manage|ment
of what I had, I thought it would be not
only a little Gothick and Inhumane, but would be
always a Foundation of Unkindne&s;s between us,
and render us &s;u&s;pected one to another; &s;o that,
upon the whole, I was oblig'd to give a new
Turn to it, and talk upon a kind of an elevated
Strain, which really was not in my Thoughts at
fir&s;t, at-all; for I own, <HI>as above,</HI> the dive&s;ting
my&s;elf of my E&s;tate, and putting my Money out
of my Hand, was the Sum of the Matter, that
made me refu&s;e to marry; but, I &s;ay, I gave it a
new Turn, upon this Occa&s;ion, as follows:</P>
<P>I told him, I had, perhaps, differing Notions
of Matrimony, from what the receiv'd Cu&s;tom
had given us of it; that I thought a Woman was
a free Agent, as well as a Man and was born free,
and cou'd &s;he manage her&s;elf &s;uitably, might en|joy
<PB N="180" REF="185">
that Liberty to as much Purpo&s;e as the Men
do; that the Laws of Matrimony were indeed,
otherwi&s;e, and Mankind at this time, acted quite
upon other Principles; and tho&s;e &s;uch, that a
Woman gave her&s;elf entirely away from her&s;elf
in Marriage, and capitulated only to be, at be&s;t,
but <HI>an &V;pper-Servant,</HI> and from the time &s;he took
the Man, &s;he was no better or wor&s; than the
Servant among the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who had his Ears
bor'd, <HI>that is,</HI> nail'd to the Door-Po&s;t; who by
that Act, gave him&s;elf up to be a Servant du|ring
Life.</P>
<P>That the very Nature of the Marriage-Contract
was, in &s;hort, nothing but giving up Liberty,
E&s;tate, Authority, and every-thing, to the Man,
and the Woman was indeed, a meer Woman ever
after, that is to &s;ay, a Slave.</P>
<P>He reply'd, that tho' in &s;ome Re&s;pects it was
as I had &s;aid, yet I ought to con&s;ider, that as
an Equivalent to this, the Man had all the Care
of things devolv'd upon him; that the Weight of
Bu&s;ine&s;s lay upon his Shoulders, and as he had
the Tru&s;t, &s;o he had the Toil of Life upon him,
his was the Labour, his the Anxiety of Living;
that the Woman had nothing to do, but to eat
the Fat, and drink the Sweet; to &s;it &s;till, and
look round her; be waited on, and made much
of; be &s;erv'd, and lov'd, and made ea&s;ie; <HI>e&s;peci|ally
if the Husband acted as became him;</HI> and that,
in general, the Labour of the Man was appointed
to make the Woman live quiet and unconcern'd
in the World; that they had the Name of Sub|jection,
without the Thing; and if in inferiour Fa|milies,
they had the Drudgery of the Hou&s;e, and
Care of the Provi&s;ions upon them; yet they had
indeed, much the ea&s;ier Part; for in general, the
Women had only the Care of managing, that is,
<PB N="181" REF="186">
&s;pending what their Husbands get; and that a
Woman had the Name of Subjection indeed, but
that they generally commanded not the Men on|ly,
but all they had; manag'd all for them&s;elves,
and where the Man did his Duty, the Woman's
Life was all Ea&s;e and Tranquility; and that &s;he
had nothing to do but to be ea&s;ie, and to make
all that were about her both ea&s;ie and merry.</P>
<P>I return'd, that while a Woman was &s;ingle, &s;he
was a Ma&s;culine in her politick Capacity; that
&s;he had then the full Command of what &s;he had,
and the full Direction of what &s;he did; that &s;he
was a Man in her &s;eparated Capacity, to all In|tents
and Purpo&s;es that a Man cou'd be &s;o to
him&s;elf that &s;he was controul'd by none, becau&s;e
accountable to none, and was in Subjection to
none; &s;o I &s;ung the&s;e two Lines of Mr.&mdash;'<HI>s.</HI></P>
<Q><L>O! 'tis plea&s;ant to be free,</L>
<L>The &s;weete&s;t MISS is Liberty.</L></Q>
<P>I added, that whoever the Woman was, that
had an E&s;tate, and would give it up to be the
Slave of <HI>a Great Man,</HI> that Woman was a Fool,
and mu&s;t be fit for nothing but a Beggar; that
it was my Opinion, a Woman was as fit to go|vern
and enjoy her own E&s;tate, without a Man, as
a Man was, without a Woman; and that, if &s;he
had a-mind to gratifie her&s;elf as to Sexes, &s;he
might entertain a Man, as a Man does a Mi|&s;tre&s;s;
that while &s;he was thus &s;ingle, &s;he
was her own, and if &s;he gave away that Power,
&s;he merited to be as mi&s;erable as it was po&s;&s;ible
that any Creature cou'd be.</P>
<P>All he cou'd &s;ay, cou'd not an&s;wer the Force
of this, as to Argument; only this, that the other
Way was the ordinary Method that the World
<PB N="182" REF="187">
was guided by; that he had Rea&s;on to ecpect I
&s;hou'd be content with that which all the World
was contented with; that he was of the Opinion,
that a &s;incere Affection between a Man and his
Wife, an&s;wer'd all the Objections that I had made
about the being a Slave, a Servant, <HI>and the like;</HI>
and where there was a mutual Love, there cou'd
be no Bondage; but that there was but one In|tere&s;t;
one Aim; one De&s;ign; and all con&s;pir'd
to make both very happy.</P>
<P><HI>Ay,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>that is the Thing I complain of;</HI> the
Pretence of Affection, takes from a Woman every
thing that can be call'd <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> &s;he is to have no
Interest; no Aim; no View; but all is the In|tere&s;t,
Aim, and View, of the Husband; &s;he is
to be the pa&s;&s;ive Creature you &s;poke of, <HI>&s;aid I;</HI>
&s;he is to lead a Life of perfect Indolence, and
living by Faith (not in God, but) in her Hus|band,
&s;he &s;inks or &s;wims, as he is either Fool or
wi&s;e Man; unhappy or pro&s;perois, and in the
middle of what &s;he thinks is her Happine&s;s and
Pro&s;perity, &s;he is ingulph'd in Mi&s;ery and Beg|gary,

I liv'd? and what dreadful Families had I liv'd
among, that had frighted me into &s;uch terrible
Apprehen&s;ions of things? that the&s;e things indeed,
might happen where Men run into hazardous
things in Trade, and without Prudence, or due
Con&s;ideration, launch'd their Fortunes in a De|gree
beyond their Strength, gra&s;ping at Adven|tures
beyond their Stocks, <HI>and the like;</HI> but that,
as he was &s;tated in the World, if I wou'd embark
with him, he had a Fortune equal with mine;
that together; we &s;hould have no Occa&s;ion of
engaging in Bu&s;ine&s;s any more; but that in any
Part of the World where I had a-mind to live,
whether <HI>England, France, Holland,</HI> or where I
would, we might &s;ettle, and live, as happily as
the World could make any one live, that if I
de&s;ir'd the Management of our E&s;tate, when put
together, if I wou'd not tru&s;t him with mine, he
would tru&s;t me with his; that we wou'd be up|on
one Bottom, and I &s;hou'd &s;teer: Ay, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI>
you'll allow me to &s;teer, <HI>that is,</HI> hold the Helm, but
you'll conn the Ship, <HI>as they call it;</HI> that is, as at
Sea, a Boy &s;erves to &s;tand at the Helm, but he that
gives him the Orders, is Piiot.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="189">
He laugh'd, at my Simile; No, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you
&s;hall be Pilot then, you &s;hall conn the Ship; ay,
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> as long as you plea&s;e, but you can take
the Helm out of my Hand when you plea&s;e, and
bid me go &s;pin: It is not you, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> that I &s;u&s;|pect,
but the Laws of Matrimony puts the Power
into your Hands; bids you do it; commands you
to command; and binds me, for&s;ooth, to obey;
you, that are now upon even Terms with me, and
I with you, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> are the next Hour &s;et up upon
the Throne, and the humble Wife plac'd at your
Foot&s;tool; all the re&s;t, all that you call Onene&s;s
Of Intere&s;t, Mutual Affection, <HI>and the like,</HI> is Cur|tefie
and Kindne&s;s then, and a Woman is indeed,
infinitely oblig'd where &s;he meets with it; but
cau't help her&s;elf where it fails.</P>
<P>Well, he did not give it over yet, but came to
the &s;erious Part, and there he thought he &s;hould
be too many for me; he fir&s;t hinted, that Mar|riage
was decreed by Heaven; that it was the
fix'd State of Life, which God had appointed for
Man's Felicity, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing a legal Po&s;te|rity;
that there cou'd be no legal Claim of E&s;tates
by Inheritance, but by Children born in Wed|lock;
that all the re&s;t was &s;unk under Scandal
and Illegitimacy; and very well he talk'd upon
that Subject, indeed.</P>
<P>But it wou'd not do; I took him &s;hort there;
Look you, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you have an Advantage of
me there indeed, in my particular Ca&s;e; but it
wou'd not be generous to make u&s;e of it; I rea|dily
grant, that at were better for me to have
marry'd you, than to admit you to the Liberty
I have given you; but as I cou'd not reconcile
my Judgment to Marriage, for the Rea&s;ons above,
and had Kindne&s;s enough for you, and Obliga|tion
too much on me, to re&s;i&s;t you, I &s;uffer'd your
<PB N="185" REF="190">
Rudene&s;s, and gave up my Virtue; but I have two
things before me to heal up that Breach of Honour,
without that de&s;perate one of Marriage; and tho&s;e
are, Repentance for what is pa&s;t, and putting an
End to it for Time to come.</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd to be concern'd, to think that I
&s;hou'd take him in that Manner; he a&s;&s;ur'd me
that I mi&s;-under&s;tood him; that he had more
Manners, as well as more Kindne&s;s for me; and
more Ju&s;tice, than to reproach me with what he had
been the Aggre&s;&s;or in, and had &s;urpriz'd me into;
That what he &s;poke, refer'd to my Words above;
that the Woman, if &s;he thought fit, might en|tertain
a Man, as the Man did a Mi&s;tre&s;s; and
that I &s;eem'd to mention that way of Living as
ju&s;tifiable, and &s;etting it as a lawful thing, and in
the Place of Matrimony.</P>
<P>Well, we &s;train'd &s;ome Compliments upon
tho&s;e Points, not worth repeating; and I added,
I &s;uppos'd when he got to-Bed to me, he thought
him&s;elf &s;ure of me; and indeed, in the ordinary
Cour&s;e of things, after he had lain with me, he
ought to think &s;o; but that, upon the &s;ame foot
of Argument which I had di&s;cours'd with him
upon, it was ju&s;t the contrary; and when a Wo|man
had been weak enough to yield up the la&s;t
Point before Wedlock, it wou'd be adding one
Weakne&s;s to another, to take the Man afterwards;
to pin down the Shame of it upon her&s;elf all
Days of her Life, and bind her&s;elf to live all her
Time with the only Man that cou'd upbraid her
with it; that in yielding at fir&s;t, &s;he mu&s;t be a
Fool, but to take the Man, is to be &s;ure to be
call'd Fool; that to re&s;i&s;t a Man, is to act with
Courage and Vigour, and to ca&s;t off the Reproach,
which, in the Cour&s;e of things, drops out of
Knowledge, and dies; the Man goes one-way, and
<PB N="186" REF="191">
the Woman another, as Fate, and the
Circum|&s;tances of Living direct; and if they keep one|another's
Council, the Folly is heard no more of;
but to take the Man, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> is the mo&s;t prepo&s;te|rous
thing in Nature, and (&s;aving your Pre&s;ence)
is to befoul one's-&s;elf, and live always in the Smell
of it; <HI>No, no,</HI> added I, after a Man has lain with
me <HI>as a Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> he ought never to lye with me
<HI>as a Wife;</HI> that's not only pre&s;erving the Crime
in Memory, but it is recording it in the Family;
if the Woman marries the Man afterwards, &s;he
bears the Reproach of it to the la&s;t Hour; if
her Husband is not a Man of a hundred Thou|&s;and,
he &s;ometime or other upbraids her with it;
if he has Children, they fail not one way or o|ther,
to hear of it; if the Children are virtu|ous,
they do their Mother the Ju&s;tice to hate her
for it; if they are wicked, they give her the
Mortification of doing the like, and giving her
for the Example: On the other-hand, if the
Man and the Woman part, there is an End of the
Crime, and an End of the Clamour; Time wears
out the Memory of it; or a Woman may remove
but a few Streets, and &s;he &s;oon out-lives it, and
hears no more of it.</P>
<P>He was confounded at this Di&s;cour&s;e, and told
me, he cou'd not &s;ay but I was right in the Main;
that as to that Part relating to managing E&s;tates,
it was arguing <HI>a la Cavalier;</HI> it was in &s;ome Sence,
right, if the Women were able to carry in on &s;o,
but that in general, the Sex were not capable of
it; their Heads were not turn'd for it, and they
had better choo&s;e a Per&s;on capable, and hone&s;t,
that knew how to do them Ju&s;tice, as Women,
as well as to love them; and that then the Trou|ble
was all taken off of their Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="192">
I told him, it was a dear Way of purcha&s;ing
their Ea&s;e; for very often when the Tremble was
taken off of their Hands, &s;o was their Money too;
and that I thought it was far &s;afer for the Sex
not to be afraid of the Trouble, but to be really
afraid of their Money; that if no-body was
tru&s;ted, no-body wou'd be deceiv'd; and $he
Staff in their own Hands, was the be&s;t Security
in the World.</P>
<P>He reply'd, that I had &s;tarted a new thing in the
World; that however I might &s;upport it by &s;ubtle
rea&s;oning, yet it was a way of arguing that was
contrary to the general Practice, and that he con|fe&s;s'd
he was much di&s;appointed in it; that had
he known I wou'd have made &s;uch a U&s;e of it,
he wou'd never have attempted what he did,
which he had no wicked De&s;ign in, re&s;olving to
make me Reparation, and that he was very &s;orry
he had been &s;o unhappy; that he was very &s;ure
he &s;hou'd never upbraid me with it hereafter,
and had &s;o good an Opinion of me, as to believe
I did not &s;u&s;pect him; but &s;eeing I was po&s;itive
in refu&s;ing him, notwith&s;tanding what had pa&s;s'd,
he had nothing to do but to &s;ecure me from Re|proach,
by going back again to <HI>Paris,</HI> that &s;o, ac|cording
to my own way of arguing, it might die
out of Memory, and I might never meet with it
again to my Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>I was not pleas'd with this Part at-all, for I had
no-mind to let him go neither; and yet I had no|mind
to give him &s;uch hold of me as he wou'd
have had; and thus I was in a kind of &s;u&s;pence,
irre&s;olute, and doubtful what Cour&s;e to take.</P>
<P>I was in the Hou&s;e with, him, as I have ob&s;erv'd,
and I &s;aw evidently that he was preparing to go
back to <HI>Paris;</HI> and particularly, I found he was
remitting Money to <HI>Paris,</HI> which was, as I un|der&s;tood
<PB N="188" REF="193">
afterwards, to pay for &s;ome Wines which he
had given Order to have bought for him, at
<HI>Troyes</HI> in <HI>Champagne;</HI> and I knew not what Cour&s;e
to take; and be&s;ides that, I was very loth to part
with him; I found al&s;o, that I was with-Child
by him, which was what I had not yet told him
of; and &s;ometimes I thought not to tell him of
it at-all; but I was in a &s;trange Place, and had
no Acquaintance, tho' I had a great deal of Sub|&s;tance,
which indeed, having no Friends there,
was the more dangerous to me.</P>
<P>This oblig'd me to take him one Morning,
when I &s;aw him, as I thought, a little anxious a|bout
his going, and irre&s;olute; <HI>&s;ays I</HI> to him,
<HI>I fancy you can hardly find in your Heart to
leave me now:</HI> The more <HI>unkind is it in you,</HI> &s;aid
he, &s;everely <HI>unkind, to refu&s;e a Man that knows not
how to part with you.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;o far from being unkind to you, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that
I will go all over the World with you, if you
de&s;ir'd me, except to <HI>Paris,</HI> where you know I
can't go.</P>
<P>It is pity &s;o much Love, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> on both Sides,
&s;hou'd ever &s;eparate.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> do you go away from me?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you won't take me.</P>
<P>But if I won't take you, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you may take
me, any-where, but to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>He was very loth to go any-where, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> with|out
me; but he mu&s;t go to <HI>Paris,</HI> or to the <HI>Ea&s;t|Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I told him I did not u&s;ee to court, but I dur&s;t
venture my&s;elf to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> with him, if
there was a Nece&s;&s;ity of his going.</P>
<P>He told me, God be thank'd, he was in no
Nece&s;&s;ity of going any-where, but that he had a
tempting Invitation to go to the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="194">
I an&s;wer'd, I wou'd &s;ay nothing to that; but
that I de&s;ir'd he wou'd go any-where but to <HI>Paris;</HI>
becau&s;e there he knew I mu&s;t not go.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he had no Remedy, but to go where
I cou'd not go; for he cou'd not bear to &s;ee me,
if he mu&s;t not have me.</P>
<P>I told him, that was the unkinde&s;t thing he
cou'd &s;ay of me, and that I ought to take it very
ill, &s;eeing I knew how very well to oblige him to
&s;tay, without yielding to what he knew I cou'd
not yield to.</P>
<P>This amaz'd him, and he told me, I was pleas'd
to be my&s;terious; but, that he was &s;ure it was in
no-body's Power to hinder him going, if he re|&s;olv'd
upon it, except me; who had Influence e|nough
upon him to make him do any-thing.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>I told him,</HI> I cou'd hinder him, becau&s;e I
knew he cou'd no more do an unkind thing by
me, than he cou'd do an unju&s;t one; and to put
him out of his Pain, I told him I was with-Child.</P>
<P>He came to me, and taking me in his Arms,
and ki&s;&s;ing me a Thou&s;and times almo&s;t, &s;aid,
Why wou'd I be &s;o unkind, not to tell him that
before?</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>'twas hard,</HI> that, to have him &s;tay,
I &s;hou'd be forc'd do as Criminals do to avoid the
Gallows, <HI>plead my Belly;</HI> and that I thought I
had given him Te&s;timonies enough of an Affe|ction
equal to that of a Wife; if I had not
only lain with him; been with-Child by him;
&s;hewn my&s;elf unwilling to part with him; but
offer'd to go to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> with him; and ex|cept
One Thing that I could not grant, what cou'd
he ask more?</P>
<P>He &s;tood mute a good-while but afterwards
told me, he had a great-deal more to &s;ay, if I
cou'd a&s;&s;ure him, that I wou'd not take ill what|ever
<PB N="190" REF="195">
Freedom he might u&s;e with me in his Di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I told him, he might u&s;e any Freedom in Words
with, me; for a Woman who had given Leave to
&s;uch other Freedoms, as I had done, had left her|&s;elf
no room to take any-thing ill, let it be what
it wou'd.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> I hope you believe, Madam,
I was born a Chri&s;tian, and that I have &s;ome
Sence of Sacred Things upon my Mind; when I
fir&s;t broke-in upon my own Virtue, and a&s;&s;aulted
yours; when I &s;urpriz'd, and, as it were, forc'd
you to that which, neither you intended, or I
de&s;ign'd, but a few Hours before, it was upon a
Pre&s;umption that you wou'd certainly marry me,
if once I cou'd go that Length with you; and it
was with an hone&s;t Re&s;olution to make you my
Wife.</P>
<P>But I have been &s;urpriz'd with &s;uch a Denial,
that no Woman in &s;uch Circum&s;tances ever gave
to a Man; for certainly it was never known, that
any Woman refus'd to marry a Man that had fir&s;t
lain with her, much le&s;s a Man that had gotten
her with-Child; but you go upon different Noti|ons
from all the World; and tho' you rea&s;on up|on
it &s;o &s;trongly, that a Man knows hardly what
to an&s;wer, yet I mu&s;t own, there is &s;omething in
it &s;hocking to Nature, and &s;omething very un|kind
to your&s;elf; but above all, it is unkind to
the Child that is yet unborn; who, if we mar|ry,
will come into the World with Advantage
enough, but if not, is ruin'd before it is born;
mu&s;t bear the eternal Reproach of what it is not
guilty of; mu&s;t be branded from its Cradle with
a Mark of Infamy, be loaded with the Crimes
and Follies of its Parents, and &s;uffer for Sins that
it never committed; This I take to be very hard,
<PB N="191" REF="196">
and indeed cruel to the poor Infant not yet
born, who you cannot think of, with any Patience,
if you have the common Affection of a Mother,
and not do that for it, which &s;hou'd at once
place it on a Level with the re&s;t or the World;
and not leave it to cur&s;e its Parents for what al&s;o

Tenderne&s;s, (and I thought I &s;aw Tears in his

ra&s;hly, and without due Con&s;ideration, done; I
&s;ay, I do not approve of it as lawful; and there|fore
tho' I did, with a View I have mention'd, one
unjustifiable Action, I cannot &s;ay, that I cou'd

what, in Judgement, we mu&s;t both condemn;
and tho' I love you above all the Women in the

pa&s;s'd between us, and by offering to quit all Pre|ten&s;ions
to any Part of your E&s;tate, &s;o that I
&s;hou'd, as it were, take a Wife after I had lain
with her, and without a Farthing Portion; which,
as my Circum&s;tances are, I need not do; I &s;ay,
notwith&s;tanding my Affection to you, which is in|expre&s;&s;ible,
yet I cannot give up Soul as well as
Body, the Intere&s;t of this World, and the Hopes
of another; and you cannot call this my Di&s;re|&s;pect

might do &s;o indeed; might entertain a Man

did not hear me &s;ay I wou'd do &s;o; and tho', by
what had pa&s;s'd, he might well cen&s;ure me in

with the Opportunity; $or that, as he had fail'd
already, he was loth to <HI>lead him&s;elf into the Tempta|tion</HI>
of offending again; and that this was the true

that he cou'd willingly leave me, and would be
very far from wanting my Invitation; but if he

to call him Father, &s;hou'd upbraid him with

could &s;atisfie my&s;elf to be &s;o cruel to an innocent
Infant, not yet born; profe&s;s'd he cou'd neither bear
the Thoughts of it, much le&s;e bear to &s;ee it, and
hop'd I wou'd not take it ill that he cou'd not
&s;tay to &s;ee me Deliver'd, for that very Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;aw he &s;poke this with a di&s;turb'd Mind, and
that it was with &s;ome Difficulty that he re&s;train'd
his Pa&s;&s;ion; &s;o I declin'd any farther Di&s;cour&s;e

and had come from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> on pur|po&s;e
to &s;eek me; he had offer'd me Marriage,
even after I was with-Child by him, and had of|fer'd
to quit all his Preten&s;ions to my E&s;tate,
and give it up to my own Management, having
a plentiful E&s;tate of his own: Here I might have
&s;ettled my&s;elf out of the reach even of Di&s;a&s;ter

even then above two Thou&s;and Pounds a Year,

I had been given up to for &s;everal Years, and

him with its being illegitimate; that if it was
a Boy, I wou'd breed it up like the Son of a Gen|tleman,
and u&s;e it well for his &s;ake; and after a
little more &s;uch Talk as this, and &s;eeing him re|&s;olv'd
to go, I retir'd, but cou'd not help letting
him &s;ee the Tears run down my Cheeks; he came
to me, and ki&s;s'd me, entreated me, conjur'd me
by the Kindne&s;s he had &s;hewn me in my Di&s;tre&s;s;
by the Ju&s;tice he had done me in my Bills and
Money-Affairs; by the Re&s;pect which made him
refu&s;e a Thou&s;and Pi&s;toles from me for his Ex|pences
with that Traytor, the <HI>Jew;</HI> by the
Pledge of our Misfortunes, <HI>&s;o he call'd it,</HI> which I
carry'd with me; and by all that the &s;incere&s;t
Affection cou'd propo&s;e to do, that I wou'd not
drive him away.</P>
<P>But it wou'd not do; I was &s;tupid and &s;ence|le&s;s,
deaf to all his Importunities, and continued
&s;o to the la&s;t; &s;o we parted, only de&s;iring me to
promi&s;e that I would write him word when I was
Deliver'd, and how he might give me an An&s;wer;
<PB N="195" REF="200">
and this I engag'd my Word I would do; and
upon his de&s;iring to be inform'd which Way I
intended to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf, I told him, I re|&s;olv'd
to go directly to <HI>England,</HI> and to <HI>London,</HI>
where I propos'd to Lye-in; but &s;ince he re&s;olv'd
to leave me, I told him, I &s;uppos'd it wou'd be of
no Con&s;equence to him, what became of me.</P>
<P>He lay in his Lodgings that Night, but went
away early in the Morning, leaving me a Letter,
in which he repeated all he had &s;aid; recom|mended
the Care of the Child, and de&s;ir'd of
me, that as he had remitted to me the Offer of
a Thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, which I wou'd have given
him for the Recompence of his Charges and
Trouble with the <HI>Jew,</HI> and had given it me back;
&s;o he de&s;ir'd I wou'd allow him to oblige me to
&s;et apart that Thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, with its Improve|ment,
for the Child, and for its Education;
earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing me to &s;ecure that little Portion
for the abandon'd Orphan, when I &s;hou'd think
fit, <HI>as he was &s;ure I wou'd,</HI> to throw away the re&s;t
upon &s;omething as worthle&s;s as my &s;incere Friend
at <HI>Paris,</HI> he concluded with moving me to re|flect
with the &s;ame Regret as he did, on our Follies
we had committed together; ask'd me Forgive|ne&s;s
for being the Aggre&s;&s;or in the Fact; and for|gave
me every-thing, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> but the Cruelty of
refu&s;ing him, which he own'd he cou'd not for|give
me &s;o heartily as he &s;hou'd do, becau&s;e he
was &s;atisfied it was an Injury to my&s;elf; would
be an Introduction to my Ruin; and that I wou'd
&s;eriou&s;ly repent of it; he foretold &s;ome fatal
things, which, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he was well a&s;&s;u'd I &s;hou'd
fall into; and that, at la&s;t I wou'd be ruin'd by
a bad Husband; bid me be the more wary, that
I might render him a Fal&s;e Prophet; but to re|member,
that if ever I came into Di&s;tre&s;s, I had
<PB N="196" REF="201">
a fa&s;t-Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> who wou'd not upbraid me
with the unkind things pa&s;t, but wou'd be al|ways
ready to return me Good for Evil.</P>
<P>This Letter &s;tunn'd me; I cou'd not think it
po&s;&s;ible for any-one, that had not dealt with the
Devil, to write &s;uch a Letter; for he &s;poke of
&s;ome particular things which afterwards were to
befal me, with &s;uch an A&s;&s;urance, that it frighted
me before-hand; and when tho&s;e things did come
to pa&s;s, I was per&s;waded he had &s;ome more than
humane Knowledge; in a word, his Advices to
me to repent, were very affectionate; his Warn|ings
of Evil to happen to me, were very kind;
and his Promi&s;e of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, if I wanted him,
were &s;o generous, that I have &s;eldom &s;een the
like; and tho' I did not at fir&s;t &s;et much by that
Part, becau&s;e I look'd upon them as what might
not happen, and as what was improbable to hap|pen
at that time; yet all the re&s;t of his Letter
was &s;o moving, that it left me very melancholly,
and I cry'd four and twenty Hours after, almo&s;t,
without cea&s;ing, about it; and yet, even all this
while, whatever it was that bewitch'd me, I had
not one &s;erious Wi&s;h that I had taken him; I
wi&s;h'd heartily indeed, that I cou'd have kept
him with me; but I had a mortal Aver&s;ion to mar|rying
him, or indeed, any-body el&s;e; but form'd
a thou&s;and wild Notions in my Head, that I was
yet gay enough, and young, and hand&s;ome enough
to plea&s;e a Man of Quality; and that I wou'd
try my Fortune at <HI>London,</HI> come of it what
wou'd.</P>
<P>Thus blinded by my own Vanity, I threw away
the only Opportunity I then had, to have effectu|ally
&s;ettl'd my Fortunes, and &s;ecur'd them for
this World; and I am a Memorial to all that
&s;hall read my Story; a &s;tanding Monument of
<PB N="197" REF="202">
the Madne&s;s and Di&s;traction which Pride and In|fatuations
from Hell runs us into; how ill our Pa&s;|&s;ions
guide us; and how dangerou&s;ly we act, when
we follow the Dictates of an ambitious Mind.</P>
<P>I was rich, beautiful, and agreeable, and not
yet old; I had known &s;omething of the Influence
I had had upon the Fancies of Men, even of the
highe&s;t Rank; I never forgot that the Prince <HI>de</HI>&mdash;had
&s;aid with an Exta&s;ie, that I was the
fine&s;t Woman in <HI>France;</HI> I knew I cou'd make
a Figure at <HI>London,</HI> and how well I cou'd grace
that Figure; I was not at a Lo&s;s how to behave,
and having already been ador'd by Princes, I
thought of nothing le&s;s than of being Mi&s;tre&s;s to
the King him&s;elf: But I go back to my immediate
Circum&s;tances at that time.</P>
<P>I got over the Ab&s;ence of my hone&s;t Merchant
but &s;lowly at fir&s;t; it was with infinite Regret
that I let him go at-all; and when I read the Let|ter
he left, I was quite confounded; as &s;oon as
he was out of Call, and irrecoverable, I wou'd
have given half I had in the World, for him back
again; my Notions of things chang'd in an In|&s;tant,
and I call'd my&s;elf a thou&s;and Fools, for
ca&s;ting my&s;elf upon a Life of Scandal and Ha|zard;
when after the Shipwreck of Virtue, Ho|nour,
and Principle, and &s;ailing at the utmo&s;t
Ri&s;que in the &s;tormy Seas of Crime, and abo|minable
Levity, I had a &s;afe Harbour pre&s;ented,
and no Heart to ca&s;t-Anchor in it.</P>
<P>His Predictions terrify'd me; his Promi&s;es of
Kindne&s;s if I came to Di&s;tre&s;s, melted me into
Tears, but frighted me with the Apprehen&s;ions of
ever coming into &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s, and fill'd my Head
with a thou&s;and Anxieties and Thoughts, how
it &s;hou'd be po&s;&s;ible for me, who had now &s;uch
a Fortune, to &s;ink again into Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="203">
Then the dreadful Scene of my Life, when I
was left with my five Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as I have
related, repre&s;ented it&s;elf again to me, and I &s;at
con&s;idering what Mea&s;ures I might take to bring
my&s;elf to &s;uch a State of De&s;olation again, and
how I &s;hou'd act to avoid it.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things wore off gradually; as to my
Friend, the Merchant, he was gone, and gone ir|recoverably,
for I dur&s;t not follow him to <HI>Paris,</HI>
for the Rea&s;ons mention'd above; again, I was
afraid to write to him to return, left he &s;hou'd
have refus'd, as I verily believ'd he wou'd; &s;o I
&s;at and cry'd intollerably, for &s;ome Days, nay, I
may &s;ay, for &s;ome Weeks; but I &s;ay, it wore off
gradually; and as I had a pretty deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s
for managing my Effects, the Hurry of that par|ticular
Part, &s;erv'd to divert my Thoughts, and in
part to wear out the Impre&s;&s;ions which had been
made upon my Mind.</P>
<P>I had &s;old my Jewels, all but the fine Diamond
Ring, which my Gentleman, the Jeweller, us'd
to wear; and this, at proper times, I wore my|&s;elf;
as al&s;o the Diamond Necklace, which the
Prince had given me, and a Pair of extraordinary
Ear-Rings, worth about 600 Pi&s;toles; the other,
which was a fine Casket, he left with me at his
going to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and a &s;mall Ca&s;e with &s;ome
Rubies and Emeralds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;ay, I &s;old them at
the <HI>Hague</HI> for 7600 Pi&s;toles; I had receiv'd all
the Bills which the Merchant had help'd me to
at <HI>Paris,</HI> and with the Money I brought with me,
they made up 13900 Pi&s;toles more; &s;o that I had
in Ready-Money, and in Account in the Bank at
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> above One and twenty Thou&s;and Pi|&s;toles,
be&s;ides Jewels; and how to get this Trea|&s;ure

<P><PB N="199" REF="204">
The Bu&s;ine&s;s I had had now with a great ma|ny
People, for receiving &s;uch large Sums, and &s;el|ling
Jewels of &s;uch con&s;iderable Value, gave me
Opportunity to know and conver&s;e with &s;everal of

<P>Having thus &s;pent nine Months in <HI>Holland;</HI> re|fus'd

had; parted unkindly, and indeed, bar|barou&s;ly
with the be&s;t Friend, and hone&s;te&s;t Man
in the World; got all my Money in my Pocket,
and a Ba&s;tard in my Belly, I took Shipping at
the <HI>Briel,</HI> in the Packet-Boat, and arriv'd &s;afe at
<HI>Harwich,</HI> where my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> was come, by
my Direction, to meet me.</P>
<P>I wou'd willingly have given ten Thou&s;and
Pounds of my Money, to have been rid of the
Burthen I had in my Belly, as above; but it
cou'd not be; &s;o I was oblig'd to bear with that
Part, and get rid of it by the ordinary Method
of Patience, and a hard Travel.</P>
<P>I was above the contemptible U&s;age that Wo|men
in my Circum&s;tances oftentimes meet with;
I had con&s;ider'd all that before-hand; and having
&s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> before-hand, and remitted her Money

there near a Week before I came; &s;o I had no|thing

where I pa&s;s'd for a <HI>French</HI> Lady, by the Title
of&mdash;.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s was, to get all my Bills ac|cepted;
which, to cut the Story &s;hort, was all
both accepted, and currently paid; and I then
re&s;olv'd to take me a Country-Lodging &s;omewhere
near the Town, to be <HI>Incognito,</HI> till I was brought|to-Bed;
which, appearing in &s;uch a Figure, and
having &s;uch an Equipage, I ea&s;ily manag'd, with|out
any-body's offering the u&s;ual In&s;ults of Pari&s;h-Enquiries:
I did not appear in my new Hou&s;e for
&s;ome time; and afterwards I thought fit, for
particular Rea&s;ons, to quit that Hou&s;e, and not
come to it at-all&punc; but take hand&s;ome large Apart|ments
in the <HI>Pall-mall,</HI> in a Hou&s;e, out of which
was a private Door into the King's Garden, by
the Permi&s;&s;ion of the Chief Gardener, who had
liv'd in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I had now all my Effects &s;ecur'd; but my
Money being my great Concern at that time, I
found it a Difficulty how to di&s;po&s;e of it, &s;o
as to bring me in an annual Intere&s;t; however,
in &s;ome time I got a &s;ub&s;tantial &s;afe Mortgage for
14000 Pound, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the famous
Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> for which, I had an E&s;tate of
1800 Pounds a Year bound to me; and had 700
Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> Intere&s;t for it.</P>
<P>This, with &s;ome other Securities, made me a
very hand&s;ome E&s;tate, of above a Thou&s;and

Pounds a Year; enough, one wou'd think, to keep
<HI>any</HI> Woman in <HI>England</HI> from being a Whore.</P>
<P>I Lay-in at&mdash;, about four Miles from
<HI>London,</HI> and brought a fine Boy into the World;
and according to my Promi&s;e, &s;ent an Account of
it to my Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> the Father of it; and
in the Letter, told him how &s;orry I was for his
going away, and did as good as intimate, that if
he wou'd come once more to &s;ee me, I &s;hould
u&s;e him better than I had done: He gave me a
very kind and obliging An&s;wer, but took not the
lea&s;t Notice of what I had &s;aid <HI>of his coming Over,</HI>
&s;o I found my Intere&s;t lo&s;t there for ever: He
gave me Joy of the Child, and hinted, that he
hop'd I wou'd make good what he had begg'd
for the poor Infant, as I had promis'd; and I
&s;ent him word again, that I wou'd fullfil his Or|der

I was in this la&s;t Letter, notwith&s;tanding what
I have &s;aid of his not taking Notice of my In|vitation,
as to ask his Pardon almo&s;t, for the
U&s;age I gave him at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and &s;toop'd &s;o
low, as to expo&s;tulate with him for not taking
Notice of my inviting him to come to me again,
as I had done; and which was &s;till more, went
&s;o far, as to make a &s;econd &s;ort of an Offer to
him, telling him almo&s;t in plain Words, that if
he wou'd come Over now, I wou'd have him;
but he never gave me the lea&s;t Reply to it at-all,
which was as ab&s;olute a Denial to me, as he was
ever able to give; &s;o I &s;at down, I cannot &s;ay
contented, but vex'd heartily that I had made
the Offer at-all; for he had, as I may &s;ay, his
full Revenge of me, in &s;corning to an&s;wer, and to
let me twice ask that of him, which he with &s;o

<P>I paid 60 <HI>l.</HI> a Year for my new Apartments,

were hand&s;ome Lodgings indeed, and very richly
furni&s;h'd; I kept my own Servants to clean and
look after them; found my own Kitchen-Ware,
and Firing; my Equipage was hand&s;ome, but not
very great: I had a Coach, a Coachman, a Foot|man,
my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> who I now dre&s;s'd like
a Gentlewoman, and made her my Companion,
and three Maids; and thus I liv'd for a time:
I dre&s;s'd to the height of every Mode; went ex|tremely
rich in Cloaths; and as for Jewels, I
wanted none; I gave a very good Livery lac'd
with Silver, and as rich as any-body below the
Nobility, cou'd be &s;een with: And thus I ap|pear'd,

no Acquaintances, only made as gay a Show as I
was able to do, and that upon all Occa&s;ions: I
found however, the World was not altogether &s;o
unconcern'd about me, as I &s;eem'd to be about
them; and fir&s;t, I under&s;tood that the Neigh|bours
begun to be mighty inqui&s;itive about me;
as who I was? and what my Circum&s;tances were?</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was the only Per&s;on that cou'd an&s;wer
their Curio&s;ity, or give any Account of me, and
&s;he a tattling Woman, and a true Go&s;&s;ip, took

Propo&s;als of the <HI>Dutch Merchant,</HI> who
offer'd me the Di&s;po&s;al of my whole E&s;tate, and
had as much of his own to maintain me with; I
was right now, in refu&s;ing tho&s;e Offers which
came generally from Gentlemen of good Families,

of them, were always needy and nece&s;&s;itous, and
wanted a Sum of Money to make them&s;elves ea|&s;ie,

then the Woman is Pri&s;oner for Life, and may
live as they plea&s;e to give her Leave: This Life

found means, by one Stratagem or other, to get
acce&s;s to my Lady&s;hip; but in &s;hort, I an&s;wer'd

on account of the Mortgage which he
help'd me to, it is nece&s;&s;ary to take Notice, that I
had much Advantage in my ordinary Affairs, by
his Advice, and therefore I call it my good For|tune;
for as he paid me &s;o con&s;iderable an annual
Income as 700 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, &s;o I am to acknowledge
my&s;elf much a Debtor, not only to the Ju&s;tice

rai&s;e my Fortune to a prodigious Height, if I
wou'd but order my Family-Oeconomy &s;o far
within my Revenue, as to lay-up every Year
&s;omething, to add to the Capital.</P>
<P>I was convinc'd of the Truth of what he &s;aid,

take it as you go, that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> &s;uppos'd by my
own Di&s;cour&s;e, and e&s;pecially, by my Woman,

as he &s;aid, by my way Living, that I cou'd not
&s;pend above one Thou&s;and; and &s;o, he added, I
might prudently lay-by <HI>1000 l.</HI> every Year, to
add to the Capital; and by adding every Year
the additional Intere&s;t, or Income of the Money
to the Capital, he prov'd to me, that in ten Year
I &s;hou'd double the <HI>1000 l. per Annum,</HI> that I

ju&s;t as Merchants do by Trade; whereas now,
<HI>&s;ays</HI> Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> by the Humour of living up to
the Extent of their Fortunes, and rather beyond,
tbe Gentlemen, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> ay, and the Nobility too,
are, almo&s;t all of them, Borrowers, and all in ne|ce&s;&s;itous
Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>As Sir <HI>Robert</HI> frequently vi&s;ited me, and was
(if I may &s;ay &s;o from his own Mouth) very
well pleas'd with my way of conver&s;ing with him,
for he knew nothing, nor &s;o much as gue&s;s'd
at what I had been; I &s;ay, as he came often
to &s;ee me, &s;o he always entertain'd me with
this Scheme of Frugality; and one time he
brought another Paper, wherein he &s;hew'd me,
much to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e as the former, to what
Degree I &s;hou'd encrea&s;e my E&s;tate, if I wou'd
come into his Method of contracting my Expen|ces;
and by this Scheme of his, it appear'd,
that laying up a thou&s;and Pounds a Year, and
every Year adding the Intere&s;t to it, I &s;hou'd in
twelve Years time have in Bank, One and twenty
Thou&s;and, and Fifty eight Pounds; after which,
I might lay-up two Thou&s;and Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>I objected, that I was a young Woman; that I
had been us'd to live plentifully, and with a
good Appearance; and that I knew not how to be
a Mi&s;er.</P>
<P>He told me, that if I thought I had enough, it
was well; but if I de&s;ir'd to have more, this
was the Way; that in another twelve Year, I
&s;hou'd be too rich, &s;o that I &s;hou'd not know
what to do with it.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="211">
Ay Sir, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you are contriving how to make
me a rich Old Woman, but that won't an&s;wer
my End; I had rather have 20000 <HI>l.</HI> now, than
60000 <HI>l.</HI> when I am fifty Year old.</P>
<P><HI>Then,</HI> Madam, &s;ays he, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e your Honour
has no Children?</HI></P>
<P>None, Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>but what are provided for;</HI>
&s;o I left him in the dark, as much as I found him:
However, I con&s;ider'd his Scheme very well, tho' I
&s;aid no more to him at that time, and I re&s;olv'd,
tho' I would make a very good Figure, I &s;ay, I
re&s;olv'd to abate a little of my Expence, and
draw in; live clo&s;er, and &s;ave &s;omething, if not
&s;o much as he propos'd to me: It was near the
End of the Year that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> made this Propo|&s;al
to me, and when the Year was up, I went to
his Hou&s;e in the City, and there I told him, I
came to thank him for his Scheme of Fruga|lity;
that I had been &s;tudying much upon it;
and tho' I had not been able to mortifie my&s;elf
&s;o much as to lay-up a thou&s;and Pounds a Year;
yet, as I had not come to him for my Intere&s;t
half-yearly, as was u&s;ual, I was now come to let
him know, that I had re&s;olv'd to lay-up that
&s;even Hundred Pound a Year, and never u&s;e a
Penny of it; de&s;iring him to help me to put it
out to Advantage.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> a Man thorowly vers'd in Arts of
improving Money, but thorowly hone&s;t, <HI>&s;aid to
me,</HI> Madam, I am glad you approve of the Me|thod
that I propos'd to you; but you have be|gun
wrong; you &s;hou'd have come for your Inte|re&s;t
at the Half-Year, and then you had had the
Money to put out; now you have lo&s;t half a
Year's Intere&s;t of 350 <HI>l.</HI> which is 9 <HI>l.</HI> for I had
but 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on the Mortgage.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="212">
Well, well, Sir, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> can you put this out
for me now?</P>
<P>Let it lie, Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> till the next Year,
and then I'll put out your 1400 <HI>l.</HI> together, and in
the mean time I'll pay you Intere&s;t for the 700 <HI>l.</HI>
&s;o he gave me his Bill for the Money, which
he told me &s;hou'd be no le&s;s than 6 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI>
Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI>'s Bill was what no-body wou'd
refu&s;e; &s;o I thank'd him, and let it lie; and next
Year I did the &s;ame; and the third Year Sir <HI>Ro|bert</HI>
got me a good Mortgage for 2200 <HI>l.</HI> at 6 <HI>per
Cent. Intere&s;t:</HI> So I had 132 <HI>l.</HI> a Year added to
my Income; which was a very &s;atisfying Ar|ticle.</P>
<P>But I return to my Hi&s;tory: As I have &s;aid, I
found that my Mea&s;ures were all wrong, the Po|&s;ture
I &s;et up in, expos'd me to innumerable Vi|&s;iters
of the Kind I have mention'd above; I was
cry'd up for a va&s;t Fortune, and one that Sir
<HI>Robert Clayton</HI> manag'd for; and Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI>
was courted for me, as much as I was for my|&s;elf:
But I had given Sir <HI>Robert</HI> his Cue; I had
told him my Opinion of Matrimony, in ju&s;t the
&s;ame Terms as I had done my Merchant, and he
came into it pre&s;ently; he own'd that my Ob|&s;ervation
was ju&s;t, and that, if I valued my Li|berty,
as I knew my Fortune, and that it was
in my own Hands, I was to blame, if I gave it
away to any-one.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Robert</HI> knew nothing of my De&s;ign;
that I aim'd at being a kept Mi&s;tre&s;s, and to have
a hand&s;ome Maintenance; and that I was &s;till
for getting Money, <HI>and laying it up too,</HI> as much
as he cou'd de&s;ire me, only by a wor&s;e Way.</P>
<P>However, Sir <HI>Robert</HI> came &s;eriou&s;ly to me one
Day, and told me, he had an Offer of Matri|mony
to make to me, that was beyond all that
<PB N="208" REF="213">
he had heard had offer'd them&s;elves, and this
was a Merchant; Sir <HI>Robert</HI> and I agreed exactly
in our Notions of a Merchant; Sir <HI>Robert</HI> &s;aid,
and I found it to be true, that a true-bred Mer|chant
is the be&s;t Gentleman in the Nation; that
in Knowledge, in Manners, in Judgment of things,
the Merchant out-did many of the Nobility;
that having once ma&s;ter'd the World, and being
above the Demand of Bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' no real
E&s;tate, they were then &s;uperiour to mo&s;t Gentle|men,
even in E&s;tate; that a Merchant in flu&s;h
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and a capital Stock, is able to &s;pend
more Money than a Gentleman of 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year
E&s;tate; that while a Merchant &s;pent, he only
&s;pent what he got, and not that; and that he
laid up great Sums every Year.</P>
<P>That an E&s;tate is a Pond; but that a Trade
was a Spring; that if the fir&s;t is once mort|gag'd,
it &s;eldom gets clear, but embarra&s;s'd the
Per&s;on for ever; but the Merchant had his E&s;tate
continually flowing; and upon this, he nam'd me
Merchants who liv'd in more real Splendor, and
&s;pent more Money than mo&s;t of the Noblemen
in <HI>England</HI> cou'd &s;ingly expend, and that they
&s;till grew immen&s;ly rich.</P>
<P>He went on to tell me, that even the Trade&s;|men
in <HI>London,</HI> &s;peaking of the better &s;ort of
Trades, cou'd &s;pend more Money in their Fami|lies,
and yet give better Fortunes to their Chil|dren,
than, generally &s;peaking, the Gentry of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
from a 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year downward, cou'd do,
and yet grow rich too.</P>
<P>The Up&s;hot of all this was, to recommend to
me, rather the be&s;towing my Fortune upon &s;ome
eminent Merchant, who liv'd already in the fir&s;t
Figure of a Merchant, and who not being in Want
or Scarcity of Money, but having a flouri&s;hing
<PB N="209" REF="214">
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and a flowing Ca&s;h, wou'd at the fir&s;t
word, &s;ettle all my Fortune on my&s;elf and Chil|dren,
and maintain me like a Queen.</P>
<P>This was certainly right; and had I taken his
Advice, I had been really happy; but my Heart
was bent upon an Independency of Fortune; and
I told him, I knew no State of Matrimony, but
what was, at be&s;t, a State of Inferiority, if not
of Bondage; that I had no Notion of it; that I
liv'd a Life of ab&s;olute Liberty now; was free
as I was born, and having a plentiful Fortune, I
did not under&s;tand what Coherence the Words
<HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Obey</HI> had with the Liberty of a <HI>Free
Woman;</HI> that I knew no Rea&s;on the Men had
to engro&s;s the whole Liberty of the Race, and
make the Women, notwith&s;tanding any de&s;parity
of Fortune, be &s;ubject to the Laws of Marriage,
of their own making; that it was my Misfor|tune
to be a Woman, but I was re&s;olv'd it &s;hou'd
not be made wor&s;e by the Sex; and &s;eeing Li|berty
&s;eem'd to be the Men's Property, I wou'd
be a <HI>Man-Woman;</HI> for as I was born free, I wou'd
die &s;o.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert</HI> &s;mil'd, and told me, I talk'd a kind
of <HI>Amazonian</HI> Language; that he found few Wo|men
of my Mind, or that if they were, they
wanted Re&s;olution to go on with it; that not|with&s;tanding
all my Notions, which he could not
but &s;ay had once &s;ome Weight in them, yet he un|der&s;tood
I had broke-in upon them, and had been
marry'd; I an&s;wer'd, I had &s;o, but he did not
hear me &s;ay, that I had any Encouragement from
what was pa&s;t, to make a &s;econd Venture; that
I was got well out of the To$&punc; and if I came
in again, I &s;hou'd have no-body to blame but
my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="215">
Sir <HI>Robert</HI> laugh'd heartily at me, but gave over
offering any more Arguments, only told me, he
had pointed me out for &s;ome of the be&s;t Merchants
in <HI>London,</HI> but &s;ince I forbad him, he wou'd
give me no Di&s;turbunce of that Kind; he ap|plauded
my Way of managing my Money,
and told me, I &s;hou'd &s;oon be mon&s;trous rich;
but he neither knew, or mi&s;tru&s;ted, that with all
this Wealth, I was yet a Whore, and was not
aver&s;e to adding to my E&s;tate at the farther Ex|pence
of my Virtue.</P>
<P>But to go on with my Story as to my way of
living; I found, as above, that my living as I
did, wou'd not an&s;wer; that it only brought the
<HI>Fortune-Hunters</HI> and Bites about me, as I have
&s;aid before, to make a Prey of me and my Mo|ney;
and in &s;hort, I was harra&s;s'd with Lovers,
<HI>Beaus,</HI> and <HI>Fops</HI> of Quality, in abundance; but it
wou'd not do, I aim'd at other things, and was
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with &s;o vain an Opinion of my own
Beauty, that nothing le&s;s than the KING him$elf
was in my Eye; and this Vanity was rais'd by
&s;ome Words <HI>let fall</HI> by a Per&s;on I convers'd with,
who was, perhaps, likely enough to have brought
&s;uch a thing to pa&s;s, had it been &s;ooner; <HI>but that
Game began to be pretty well $ver at Court:</HI> However,
the having mention'd &s;uch a thing, it &s;eems, a lit|tle
too publickly, it brought abundance of People
about me, upon a wicked Account too.</P>
<P>And now I began to act in a new Sphere; the
Court was exceeding gay and fine, tho' fuller of
Men than of Women, the Queen not affecting to
be very much in publick; on the other hand, it
is no Slander upon the Courtiers, <HI>to &s;ay,</HI> they were
as wicked as any-body in rea&s;on cou'd de&s;ire them:
The KING had &s;everal Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who were
prodigious fine, and there was a glorious Show on
<PB N="211" REF="216">
that Side indeed: If the Sovereign gave him&s;elf
a Loo&s;e, it cou'd not be expected the re&s;t of the
Court &s;hou'd be all Saints; &s;o far was it from
that, tho' I wou'd not make it wor&s;e than it was,
that a Woman that had any-thing agreeable in her
Appearance, cou'd never want Followers.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found my&s;elf throng'd with Admirers,
and I receiv'd Vi&s;its from &s;ome Per&s;ons of very
great Figure, who always introduc'd them&s;elves
by the help of an old Lady or two, who were
now become my Intimates; and one of them, I
under&s;tood afterwards, was &s;et to-work on purpo&s;e
to get into my Favour, in order to introduce
what follow'd.</P>
<P>The Conver&s;ation we had, was generally court|ly,
but civil; at length, &s;ome Gentlemen propos'd
to Play, and made, what they call'd, a Party;
this it &s;eems, was a Contrivance of one of my
Female hangers-on, <HI>for, as I &s;aid, I had two of them,</HI>
who thought this was the way to introduce Peo|ple
as often as &s;he pleas'd, and &s;o indeed, it was:
They play'd high, and &s;tay'd late, but begg'd
my Pardon, only ask'd Leave to make an Ap|pointment
for the next Night; I was as gay, and
as well-pleas'd as any of them, and one Night told
one of the Gentlemen, my Lord&mdash;, that &s;ee|ing
they were doing me the Honour of diverting
them&s;elves at my Apartment, and de&s;ir'd to be
there &s;ometimes, I did not keep a Gaming-Ta|ble,
but I wou'd give them a little Ball the next
Day, if they pleas'd; which they accepted very
willingly.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the Evening the Gentlemen be|gan
to come, where I let them &s;ee, that I under|&s;tood
very well what &s;uch things meant: I had
a large Dining-Room in my Apartments, with five
other Rooms on the &s;ame Floor, all which I $word$
<PB N="212" REF="217">
Drawing-Rooms for the Occa&s;ion, having all the
Beds taken down for the Day; in three of the&s;e
I had Tables plac'd, cover'd with Wine and Sweet-Meats;
the fourth had a green Table for Play,
and the fifth was my own Room, where I &s;at,
and where I receiv'd all the Company that came
to pay their Compliments to me: I was dre&s;s'd,
you may be &s;ure, to all the Advantage po&s;&s;ible,
and had all the Jewels on, that I was Mi&s;tre&s;s of:
My Lord&mdash;, to whom I had made the In|vitation,
&s;ent me a Sett of fine Mu&s;ick from the
Play-Hou&s;e, and the Ladies danc'd, and we be|gan
to be very merry; when about eleven a-Clock
I had Notice given me, that there were
&s;ome Gentlemen coming in Ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd a little &s;urpriz'd, and began to appre|hend
&s;ome Di&s;turbance; when my Lord&mdash;perceiving
it, &s;poke to me to be ea&s;ie, for that
there was a Party of the Guards at the Door,
which &s;hou'd be ready to prevent any Rudene&s;s;
and another Gentleman gave me a Hint, as if the
KING was among the Masks; I colour'd, as red
as Blood it&s;elf cou'd make a Face look, and ex|pre&s;s'd
a great Surprize; however, there was
no going back; &s;o I kept my Station in my
Drawing-Room, but with the Folding-Doors wide
open.</P>
<P>A-while after, the Masks came in, and began
with a Dance <HI>a la Comique,</HI> performing wonder|fully
indeed; while they were dancing, I with|drew,
and le$t a Lady to an&s;wer for me, that I
wou'd return immediately; in le&s;s than half an
Hour I return'd, dre&s;s'd in the Habit of <HI>a Turki&s;h
Prince&s;s;</HI> the Habit I got at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> when my
<HI>Foreign Prince</HI> bought me a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Slave, as I have
&s;aid, the <HI>Malthe&s;e</HI> Man of War had, it &s;eems,
taken a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el going from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to
<PB N="213" REF="218">
<HI>Alexandria,</HI> in which were &s;ome Ladies bound for
<HI>Grand Cairo</HI> in <HI>Egypt;</HI> and as the Ladies were made
Slaves, &s;o their fine Cloaths were thus expos'd;
and with this <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Slave, I bought the rich
Cloaths too: The Dre&s;s was extraordinary fine
indeed, I had bought it as a Curio&s;ity, having
never &s;een the like; the Robe was a fine <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> or
<HI>India</HI> Damask; the Ground white, and the Flow|ers
blue and gold, and the Train held five Yards;
the Dre&s;s under it, was a Ve&s;t of the &s;ame, em|broider'd
with Gold, and &s;et with &s;ome Pearl in
the Work, and &s;ome <HI>Turquois</HI> Stones; to the
Ve&s;t, was a Girdle five or &s;ix Inches wide, after
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mode; and on both Ends where it
join'd, or hook'd, was &s;et with Diamonds for eight
Inches either way, only they were not true Dia|monds;
but no-body knew that but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Turban, or Head-Dre&s;s, had a Pinacle on
the top, but not above five Inches, with a Piece
of loo&s;e Sarcenet hanging from it; and on the
Front, ju&s;t over the Forehead, was a good Jewel,
which I had added to it.</P>
<P>This Habit, as above, co&s;t me about &s;ixty Pi|&s;toles
in <HI>Italy,</HI> but co&s;t much more in the Coun|try
from whence it came; and little did I think,
when I bought it, that I &s;hou'd put it to &s;uch a
U&s;e as this; tho' I had dre&s;s'd my&s;elf in it many
times, by the help of my little <HI>Turk,</HI> and after|wards
between <HI>Amy</HI> and I, only to &s;ee how I
look'd in it: I had &s;ent her up before, to get
it ready, and when I came up, I had nothing to
do, but &s;lip it on, and was down in my Draw|ing-Room
in a little more than a quarter of an
Hour; when I came there, the room was full of
Company, but I order'd the Folding-Doors to be
&s;hut for a Minute or two, till I had receiv'd
the Compliments of the Ladies that were in the
<PB N="214" REF="219">
Room, and had given them a full View of my
Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>But my Lord&mdash;, who happen'd to be in
the Room, &s;lipp'd out at another Door, and
brought back with him one of the Masks, a tall
well-&s;hap'd Per&s;on, but who had no Name, <HI>being
all Mask'd,</HI> nor would it have been allow'd to ask
any Per&s;on's Name on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; the Per|&s;on
&s;poke in <HI>French</HI> to me, that it was the fine&s;t
Dre&s;s he had ever &s;een; and ask'd me, if he
&s;hou'd have the Honour to dance with me? I
bow'd, as giving my Con&s;ent, but &s;aid, As I had
been a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> I cou'd not dance after the
Manner of this Country; I &s;uppos'd their Mu&s;ick
wou'd not play <HI>a la More&s;que;</HI> he an&s;wer'd mer|rily,
I had a Chri&s;tian's Face, and he'd venture
it, that I cou'd dance like a Chri&s;tian; adding,
that &s;o much Beauty cou'd not be <HI>Mahometan:</HI>
Immediately the Folding-Doors were flung open,
and he led me into the Room: The Company
were under the greate&s;t Surprize imaginable; the
very Mu&s;ick &s;topp'd a-while to gaze; for the Dre&s;s
was indeed, exceedingly &s;urprizing, perfectly new,
very agreeable, and wonderful rich.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, <HI>whoever he was,</HI> for I never
knew, led me only a Courant, and then ask'd me,
if I had a-mind to dance an Antick, that is to &s;ay,
whether I wou'd dance the Antick as they had
danc'd in Ma&s;querade, or any-thing by my&s;elf;
I told him, any thing el&s;e rather, if he pleas'd;
&s;o we danc'd only two <HI>French</HI> Dances, and he led
me to the Drawing-Room Door, when he retir'd
to the re&s;t of the Masks: When he left me at the
Drawing-Room Door, I did not go in, as he
thought I wou'd have done, but turn'd about, and
$word$ my&s;elf to the whole Room, and calling
$word$ Woman to m$, gave her &s;ome Directions to
<PB N="215" REF="220">
the Mu&s;ick, by which the Company pre&s;ently un|der&s;tood
that I would give them a Dance by my|&s;elf:
Immediately all the Hou&s;e ro&s;e up, and paid
me a kind of a Compliment, by removing back
every way to make me room, for the Place was
exceeding full; the Mu&s;ick did not at fir&s;t hit the
Tune that I directed, which was a <HI>French</HI> Tune,
&s;o I was forc'd to &s;end my Woman to 'em again,
&s;tanding all this while at my Drawing-Room Door;
but as &s;oon as my Woman &s;poke to them again,
they play'd it right; and I, to let them &s;ee it was
&s;o, &s;tepp'd forward to the middle of the Room;
then they began it again, and I danc'd by my|&s;elf
a Figure which I learnt in <HI>France,</HI> when the
Prince <HI>de</HI>&mdash;de&s;ir'd I wou'd dance for his
Diver&s;ion; it was indeed, a very fine Figure, in|vented
by a famous Ma&s;ter at <HI>Paris,</HI> for a Lady
or a Gentleman to dance &s;ingle; but being per|fectly
new, it pleas'd the Company exceedingly,
and they all thought it had been <HI>Turki&s;h;</HI> nay,
one Gentleman had the Folly to expo&s;e him&s;elf
&s;o much, as to &s;ay, <HI>and I think &s;wore too,</HI> that
he had &s;een it danc'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> which was
ridiculous enough.</P>
<P>At the fini&s;hing the Dance, the Company clapp'd,
and almo&s;t &s;houted; and one of the Gentlemen
cry'd out, <HI>Roxana Roxana</HI> by&mdash;, with an
Oath; upon which fooli&s;h Accident I had the
Name of <HI>Roxana</HI> pre&s;ently fix'd upon me all over
the Court End of Town, as effectually as if I had
been Chri&s;ten'd <HI>Roxana:</HI> I had, it &s;eems, the Fe|licity
of plea&s;ing every-body that Night, to an
Extreme; and my Ball, but e&s;pecially my Dre&s;s,
was the Chat of the Town for that Week, and &s;o
the Name <HI>Roxana</HI> was the Toa&s;t at, and about the
Court; no other Health was to be nam'd with it.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="221">
Now things began to work as I wou'd have
them, and I began to be very popular, as much
as I cou'd de&s;ire: The Ball held till (as well
as I was pleas'd with the Show) I was &s;ick of
the Night; the Gentlemen mask'd, went off about
three a-Clock in the Morning; the other Gen|tlemen
&s;at down to Play; the Mu&s;ick held it
out; and &s;ome of the Ladies were dancing at Six
in the Morning.</P>
<P>But I was mighty eager to know who it was
danc'd with me; &s;ome of the Lords went &s;o far
as to tell me, I was very much honour'd in my
Company; one of them &s;poke &s;o broad, as almo&s;t
to &s;ay it was the KING, but I was convinc'd af|terwards,
it was not; and another reply'd, If he
had been His Maje&s;ty, he &s;hou'd have thought
it no Di&s;honour to Lead-up a <HI>Roxana;</HI> but to
this Hour I never knew po&s;itively who it was;
and by his Behaviour I thought he was too young,
His Maje&s;ty being at that time in an Age that
might be di&s;cover'd from a young Per&s;on, even in
his Dancing.</P>
<P><HI>Be that as it wou'd,</HI> I had 500 Guneas &s;ent me
the next Morning, and the Me&s;&s;enger was order'd
to tell me, that the Per&s;ons who &s;ent it, de&s;ir'd a
Ball again at my Lodgings on the next <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI>
but that they wou'd have my Leave to give the
Entertainment them&s;elves: I was mighty well
pleas'd with this, (to be &s;ure) but very inqui&s;itive
to know who the Money came from; but the
Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ilent as Death, as to that Point;
and bowing always at my Enquiries, begg'd me
to ask no Que&s;tions which he cou'd not give an
obliging An&s;wer to.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention that the Gentlemen that
play'd, gave a Hundred Guineas to the Box,
<HI>$word$ they call'd it,</HI> and at the End of their Play,
<PB N="217" REF="222">
they ask'd my Gentlewoman of the Bed-Cham|ber,
as they call'd her, (Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> for&s;ooth) and
gave it her; and gave twenty Guineas more a|mong
the Servants.</P>
<P>This magnificent Doings egually both pleas'd
and &s;urpriz'd me, and I hardly knew where I was;
but especially, that Notion of the KING being
the Per&s;on that danc'd with me, puff'd me up to
that Degree, that I not only did not know any|body
el&s;e, but indeed, was very far from know|ing
my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I had now the next <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> to provide for the
the like Company; but alas! it was all taken out
of my Hand; three Gentlemen, who yet were,
it &s;eems, but Servants, came on the <HI>Saturday,</HI> and
bringing &s;ufficient Te&s;timonies that they were
right, for one was the &s;ame who brought the
five hundred Guineas; I &s;ay, three of them came,
and brought Bottles of all &s;orts of Wines, and
Hampers of Sweet-Meats to &s;uch a Quantity, it
appear'd they de&s;ign'd to hold the Trade on more
than once, and that they wou'd furni&s;h every|thing
to a Profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>However, as I found a Deficiency in two things,
I made Provi&s;ion of about twelve Dozen of fine
Damask Napkins, with Table-cloaths of the &s;ame,
&s;ufficient to cover all the Tables, with three Ta|ble-cloaths
upon every Table, and Side-boards in
Proportion; al&s;o I bought a hand&s;ome Quantity of
Plate, nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;erv'd all the Side-boards,
but the Gentlemen would not &s;uffer any of it to
be us'd; telling me, they had bought fine <HI>China</HI>
Di&s;hes and Plates for the whole Service; and
that in &s;uch publick Places they cou'd not be
an&s;werable for the Plate; &s;o it was &s;et all up in
a large Gla&s;s-Cupboard in the Room I &s;at in,
where it made a very good Show indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="223">
On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> there came &s;uch an Appearance of
Gentlem$n and Ladies, that my Apartments were
by no means able to receive them; and tho&s;e who
in particular appear'd as Principals, gave Order be|low,
to let no more Company come up; the Street
was full of Coaches with Coronets, and fine Gla&s;s-Chairs;
and in &s;hort, it was impo&s;&s;ible to receive
the Company; I kept my little Room, as before,
and the Dancers fill'd the great Room; all the
Drawing-Rooms al&s;o were fill'd, and three
Rooms below-Stairs, which were not mine.</P>
<P>It was very well that there was a &s;trong Party
of the Guards brought to keep the Door, for
without that, there had been &s;uch a promi&s;cuous
Crowd, and &s;ome of them &s;candalous too, that
we &s;hou'd have been all Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion;
but the three Head-Servants manag'd all that, and
had a Word to admit all the Company by.</P>
<P>It was uncertain to me, and is to this Day, who
it was that danc'd with me the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> before,
when the Ball was my own; but that the K&mdash;was
at this A&s;&s;embly, was out of Que&s;tion with
me, by Circum&s;tances that I &s;uppo&s;e I cou'd
not be deceiv'd in; and particularly, that there
were five Persons who were not Mask'd, three
of them had blue Garters, and they appear'd not
to me till I came out to dance.</P>
<P>This Meeting was manag'd ju&s;t as the fir&s;t, tho'
with much more Magnificence, becau&s;e of the
Company; I plac'd my&s;elf (exceedingly rich in
Cloaths and Jewels) in the middle of my little
Room, as before, and made my Compliment to
all the Company, as they pa&s;s'd me, as I did be|fore;
but my Lord&mdash;, who had &s;poken open|ly
to me the fir&s;t Night, came to me, and unmask|ing,
told me the Company had order'd him to tell
me, they hop'd they &s;hou'd &s;ee me in the Dre&s;s
<PB N="219" REF="224">
I had appear'd in the fir&s;t Day, which had been
&s;o acceptable, that it had been the Occa&s;ion of
this new Meeting; and Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> there
are &s;ome in this A&s;&s;embly, who it is worth your
while to oblige.</P>
<P>I bow'd to my Lord&mdash;, and immediately
withdrew: While I was above, a-dre&s;&s;ing in my
new Habit, two Ladies, perfectly unknown to me,
were convey'd into my Apartment below, by the
Order of a Noble Per&s;on, who, with his Family,
had been in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and here indeed, I thought I
&s;hou'd have been out-done, or perhaps, baulk'd.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e Ladies was dre&s;s'd mo&s;t exqui|&s;itely
fine indeed, in the Habit of a Virgin Lady
of Quality of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and the other in the &s;ame
Habit of <HI>Armenia,</HI> with each of them a Woman-Slave
to attend them.</P>
<P>The Ladies had their Petticoats &s;hort, to their
Ancles, but pleated all round, and before them
&s;hort Aprons, but of the fine&s;t Point that cou'd
be &s;een; their Gowns were made with long An|tick
Sleeves hanging down behind, and a Train
let down; they had no Jewels; but their Heads
and Brea&s;ts were dre&s;s'd up with Flowers, and
they both came in veil'd.</P>
<P>Their Slaves were <HI>bare-headed;</HI> but their long
black Hair was breeded in Locks hanging down
behind, to their Wa&s;tes, and tied up with Rib|bands;
they were dre&s;s'd exceeding rich, and
were as beautiful as their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; for none
of them had any Masks on: They wanted in my
Room till I came down, and all $word$ their Re|&s;pects
to me after the $word$ $nner, and $at
down on a <HI>Safra,</HI> that is to $word$ cro&s;s-legg'd
on $span$ laid on the
$span$</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="225">
This was admirably fine, and I was indeed,
&s;tartled at it; they made their Compliment to
me in <HI>French,</HI> and I reply'd in the &s;ame Language;
when the Doors were open'd, they walk'd into
the Dancing-Room, and danc'd &s;uch a Dance, as
indeed, no-body there had ever &s;een, and to an
In&s;trument like a Guittar, with a &s;mall low-found|ing
Trumpet, which indeed, was very fine, and
which my Lord&mdash;had provided.</P>
<P>They danc'd three times all-alone, for no-body
indeed, cou'd dance with them: The Novel|ty
pleas'd, truly, but yet there was &s;omething
wild and <HI>Bizarre</HI> in it, becau&s;e they really acted
to the Life the barbarous Country whence they
came; but as mine had the <HI>French</HI> Behaviour un|der
the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Dre&s;s, it was every way as
new, and pleas'd much better, indeed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had &s;hewn their <HI>Georgian</HI> and
<HI>Armenian</HI> Shapes, and danc'd, as I have &s;aid, three
times, they withdrew, paid their Compliment to
me, (for I was Queen of the Day) and went off
to undre&s;s.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen then danc'd with Ladies all
in Masks, and when they &s;topp'd, no-body ro&s;e
up to dance, but all call'd out <HI>Roxana, Roxana;</HI> in
the Interval, my Lord&mdash;had brought another
mask'd Per&s;on into my Room, who I knew not,
only that I cou'd di&s;cern it was not the &s;ame Per&s;on
that led me out before: This noble Per&s;on (for I
afterwards under&s;tood it was the Duke of&mdash;)
after a &s;hort Compliment, led me out into the
middle of the Room.</P>
<P>I was dre&s;s'd in the &s;ame Ve&s;t and Girdle as be|fore;
but the Robe had a Mantle over it, which
is u&s;ual in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Habit, and it was of Crim|&s;on
and Green; the Green brocaded with Gold;
and my <HI>Tyhiaai,</HI> or <HI>Head-Dre&s;s,</HI> vary'd a little from
<PB N="221" REF="226">
that I had before, as it &s;tood higher, and had
&s;ome Jewels about the ri&s;ing Part; which made it
look like a Turban crown'd.</P>
<P>I had no Mask, neither did I Paint; and yet
I had the Day of all the Ladies that appear'd at
the Ball, I mean, of tho&s;e that appear'd with Fa|ces
on; as for tho&s;e Mask'd, nothing cou'd be
&s;aid of them, no doubt there might be many finer
than I was; it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that the Habit
was infinitely advantageous to me, and every-body
look'd at me with a kind of Plea&s;ure, which gave
me great Advantage too.</P>
<P>After I had danc'd with that noble Per&s;on, I
did not offer to dance by my&s;elf, as I had be|fore;
but they all call'd out <HI>Roxana</HI> again; and
two of the Gentlemen came into the Drawing-Room,
to intreat me to give them the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Dance, which I yielded to, readily; &s;o I came
out and danc'd, ju&s;t as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>While I was dancing, I perceiv'd five Per&s;ons
&s;tanding all together, and among them, one only
with his Hat on; it was an immediate Hint to me
who it was, and had at fir&s;t, almo&s;t put me into
&s;ome Di&s;order; but I went on, received the Ap|plau&s;e
of the Hou&s;e, as before, and retir'd into
my own Room; when I was there, the five Gen|tlemen
came cro&s;s the Room to my Side, and co|ming
in, follow'd by a Throng of Great Per&s;ons,
the Per&s;on with his Hat on, &s;aid Madam <HI>Roxana</HI>
you <HI>perform to Admiration;</HI> I was prepar'd, and
offer'd to kneel to ki&s;s his Hand, but he declin'd
it, and &s;aluted me, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing back again thro'
the Great Room, went away.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay here, who this was, but I &s;ay, I
came afterwards to know &s;omething more plainly;
I wou'd have withdrawn, and di&s;rob'd, being
&s;omewhat too thin in that Dre&s;s, unlac'd, and open|brea&s;ted,
<PB N="222" REF="227">
as if I had been in my Shift; but it cou'd
not be, and I was oblig'd to dance afterwards with
&s;ix or eight Gentlemen, mo&s;t, if not all of them,
of the Fir&s;t Rank; and I was told afterwards, that
one of them was the D&mdash;of <HI>M&mdash;th.</HI></P>
<P>About two or three a-Clock in the Morning, the
Company began to decrea&s;e, the Number of Wo|men
e&s;pecially, dropp'd away Home, &s;ome and
&s;ome at a time; and the Gentlemen retir'd down
Stairs, where they unmask'd, and went to Play.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> waited at the Room where they Play'd;
&s;at up all-Night to attend them; and in the
Morning, when they broke-up, they &s;wept the
Box into her Lap, when &s;he counted out to me,
&s;ixty two Guineas and a half; and the other Ser|vants
got very well two: <HI>Amy</HI> came to me when
they were all gone, <HI>Law&mdash;Madam,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI>
with a long gaping Cry, what &s;hall I do with all
this Money? And indeed, the poor Creature was
half-mad with Joy.</P>
<P>I was now in my Element; I was as much talk'd
of as any-body cou'd de&s;ire, and I did not doubt
but &s;omething or other wou'd come of it; but
the Report of my being &s;o rich, rather was a Baulk
to my View, than any-thing el&s;e; for the Gentle|men
that wou'd, perhaps, have been trouble&s;ome
enough otherwi&s;e, &s;eem'd to be kept off; for
<HI>Roxana</HI> was too high for them.</P>
<P>There is a Scene which came in here, which I
mu&s;t cover from humane Eyes or Ears; for three
Years and about a Month, <HI>Roxana</HI> liv'd retir'd, ha|ving
been oblig'd to make an Excur&s;ion, in a Man|ner,
and with a Per&s;on, which Duty, and private
Vows, obliges her not to reveal, at lea&s;t, not yet.</P>
<P>At the End of this Time I appear'd again; but
I mu&s;t add, that as I had in this Time of Retreat,
<HI>made Hay,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;&s;o I did not come Abroad
<PB N="223" REF="228">
again with the &s;ame Lu&s;tre, or &s;hine with &s;o much
Advantage as before; for as &s;ome People had got
at lea&s;t, a Su&s;picion of where I had been, and
who had had me all the while, it began to b$
publick, that <HI>Roxana</HI> was, in &s;hort, a meer <HI>Roxana,</HI>
neither better nor wor&s;e; and not that Woman of
Honour and Virtue that was at fir&s;t &s;uppos'd.</P>
<P>You are now to &s;uppo&s;e me about &s;even Years
come to Town, and that I had not only &s;uffer'd
the old Revenue, which I hinted was manag'd by
Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> to grow, as was mention'd be|fore;
but I had laid-up an incredible Wealth, the
time con&s;ider'd; and had I yet had the lea&s;t
Thought of reforming, I had all the Opportu|nity
to do it with Advantage, that ever Woman
had; for the common Vice of all Whores, I mean
Money, was out of the Que&s;tion, nay, even Ava|rice
it&s;elf &s;eem'd to be glutted; for, including
what I had &s;av'd in re&s;erving the Intere&s;t of
14000 <HI>l.</HI> which, as above, I had left to grow;
and including &s;ome very good Pre&s;ents I had
made to me, in meer Compliment, upon the&s;e
&s;hining ma&s;querading Meetings, which I held up
for about two Years, and what I made of three
Years of the mo&s;t glorious Retreat, <HI>as I call it,</HI> that
ever Woman had, I had fully doubled my fir&s;t
Sub&s;tance, and had near 5000 Pounds in Money,
which I kept at-home; be&s;ides abundance of Plate,
and Jewels, which I had either given me, or had
bought to &s;et my&s;elf out for Publick Days.</P>
<P>In a word, I had now five and thirty Thou|&s;and
Pounds E&s;tate; and as I found Ways to live
without wa&s;ting either Principal or Intere&s;t, I
laid-up 2000 <HI>l.</HI> every Year, at lea&s;t, out of the
meer Intere&s;t, adding it to the Principal; and
thus I went on.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="229">
After the End of what I call my Retreat, and
out of which I brought a great deal of Money, I ap|pear'd
again, but I &s;eem'd like an old Piece of
Plate that had been hoarded up &s;ome Years, and
comes out tarni&s;h'd and di&s;colour'd; &s;o I came
out blown, and look'd like <HI>a ca&s;t-off Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> nor
indeed, was I any better; tho' I was not at-all
impair'd in Beauty, except that I was a little fat|ter
than I was formerly, and always granting that
I was four Years older.</P>
<P>However, I pre&s;erv'd the Youth of my Tem|per;
was always bright, plea&s;ant in Company,
and agreeable to every-body, or el&s;e every-body
flatter'd me; and in this Condition I came A|broad
to the World again; and tho' I was
not &s;o popular as before, and indeed, did not
&s;eek it, becau&s;e I knew it cou'd not be; yet I
was far from being without Company, and that of
the greate&s;t Quality, <HI>of Subjects I mean,</HI> who fre|quently
vi&s;ited me, and &s;ometimes we had Meet|ings
for Mirth, and Play, at my Apartments,
where I fail'd not to divert them in the mo&s;t
agreeable Manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Nor cou'd any of them make the lea&s;t parti|cular
Application to me, from the Notion they
had of my exce&s;&s;ive Wealth, which, as they
thought, plac'd me above the meanne&s;s of a Main|tenance;
and &s;o left no room to come ea&s;ily about
me.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t I was very hand&s;omly attack'd by
a Per&s;on of Honour, and (which recommended
him particularly to me) a Per&s;on of a very great
E&s;tate; he made a long Introduction to me upon
the Subject of my Wealth: Ignorant Creature!
<HI>&s;aid $ to my&s;elf,</HI> con&s;idering him as a LORD; was
there ever Woman in the World that cou'd &s;toop
to the Ba&s;ene&s;s of being a Whore, and was above
<PB N="225" REF="230">
taking the Reward of her Vice! <HI>No, no depend
upon it,</HI> if your Lord&s;hip obtains any-thing of me, you
mu&s;t pay for it; and the Notion of my being &s;o rich,
&s;erves only to make it co&s;t you the dearer, &s;eeing you
cannot offer a &s;mall Matter to a Woman of 2000 <HI>l.
a Year E&s;tate.</HI></P>
<P>After he had harangu'd upon that Subject a
good-while, and had a&s;&s;ur'd me he had no De|&s;ign
upon me; that he did not come to make a
Prize of me, or to pick my Pocket, which (by the
way) I was in no fear of, for I took too much Care
of my Money, to part with any of it that way;
he then turn'd his Di&s;cour&s;e to the Subject of
Love; a Point &s;o ridiculous to me, without the
the main thing, I mean the Money, that I had no
Patience to hear him make &s;o long a Story of it.</P>
<P>I receiv'd him civilly, and let him &s;ee I cou'd
bear to hear a wicked Propo&s;al, without being af|fronted,
and yet I was not to be brought into it
too ea&s;ily: He vi&s;ited me a long-while, and in
&s;hort, courted me as clo&s;ely and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, as if
he had been wooing me to Matrimony; he made me
&s;everal valuable Pre&s;ents, which I &s;uffer'd my&s;elf
to be prevail'd with to accept, but not without
great Difficulty.</P>
<P>Gradually I &s;uffer'd al&s;o his other Importunities,
and when he made a Propo&s;al of a Compliment,
or Appointment to me, for a Settlement, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI>
That tho' I was rich, yet there was not the le&s;s
due from him, to acknowledge the Favours he re|ceiv'd;
and that if I was to be his, I &s;hou'd not
live at my own Expence, <HI>co&s;t what it wou'd:</HI> I told
him, I was far from being Extravagant, and yet
I did not live at the Expence of le&s;s than 500 <HI>l.</HI> a
Year out of my own Pocket; that however, I was not
covetous of &s;ettled Allowances, for I look'd upon
that as a kind of <HI>Golden Chain,</HI> &s;omething like Ma|trimony;
<PB N="226" REF="231">
that tho' I knew how to be true to a
Man of Honour, as I knew his Lord&s;hip to be,
yet I had a kind of Aver&s;ion to the Bonds; and
tho' I was not &s;o rich as the World talk'd me up
to be, yet I was not &s;o poor as to bind my&s;elf
to Hard&s;hips, for a Pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>He told me, he expected to make my Life per|fectly
ea&s;ie, and intended it &s;o; that he knew of
no Bondage there cou'd be in a private Engage|ment
between us; that the Bonds of Honour he
knew I wou'd be ty'd by, and think them no Bur|then;
and for other Obligations, he &s;corn'd to
expect any-thing from me, but what he knew,
as a Woman of Honour, I cou'd grant; then, as
to Maintenance, he told me, he wou'd &s;oon &s;how
me that he valued me infinitely above 500 <HI>l.</HI> a
Year; and upon this foot we began.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd kinder to him after this Di&s;cour&s;e;
and as Time and Private Conver&s;ation made us
very intimate, we began to come nearer to the main
Article, <HI>namely,</HI> the 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; he offer'd
that at fir&s;t Word; and to acknowledge it as
an infinite Favour to have it be accepted of; and I,
that thought it was too much by all the Money,
&s;uffer'd my&s;elf to be ma&s;ter'd, or prevail'd with,
to yield, even on but a bare Engagement upon Pa|role.</P>
<P>When he had obtain'd his End that way, I told
him my Mind: Now you &s;ee, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI>
how weakly I have acted, <HI>namely,</HI> to yield to you
without any Capitulation, or any-thing &s;ecur'd to
me, but that which you may cea&s;e to allow, when
you plea&s;e; if I am the le&s;s valued for &s;uch a Con|fidence,
I &s;hall be injur'd in a Manner that I will
endeavour not to de&s;erve.</P>
<P>He told me, that he wou'd make it evident to
me, that he did not &s;eek me by way of Bargain,
<PB N="227" REF="232">
as &s;uch things were often done; that as I had
treated him with a generous Confidence, &s;o I &s;hou'd
find I was in the Hands of a Man of Honour, and
one that knew how to value the Obligation; and
upon this, he pull'd out a Gold&s;mith's Bill for
300 <HI>l.</HI> which, putting it into my Hand, he &s;aid
he gave me as a Pledge, that I &s;hou'd not be a
Lo&s;er by my not having made a Bargain with
him.</P>
<P>This was engaging indeed, and gave me a good
Idea of our future Corre&s;pondence; and in &s;hort,
as I cou'd not refrain treating him with more
Kindne&s;s than I had done before, &s;o one thing
begetting another, I gave him &s;everal Te&s;timonies
that I was entirely his own, by Inclination, as well
as by the common Obligation of a Mi&s;tre&s;s; and
this pleas'd him exceedingly.</P>
<P>Soon after this private Engagement, I began to
con&s;ider, whether it were not more &s;uitable to the
Manner of Life I now led, to be a little le&s;s pub|lick;
and as I told my Lord, it wou'd rid me of
the Importunities of others, and of continual Vi|&s;its
from a &s;ort of People who he knew of, and
who, by the way, having now got the Notion of
me which I really de&s;erv'd, began to talk of the
old Game, Love and Gallantry, and to offer at what
was rude enough; things as nauceous to me now,
as if I had been married, and as virtuous as other
People: The Vi&s;its of the&s;e People began indeed,
to be unea&s;ie to me, and particularly, as they were
always very tedious and impertinent; nor cou'd
my Lord&mdash;be pleas'd with them at-all, if
they had gone on: It wou'd be diverting to &s;et
down here, in what manner I repuls'd the&s;e &s;ort
of People; how in &s;ome I re&s;ented it as an Affront,
and told them, that I was &s;orry they &s;hou'd oblige
me to vindicate my&s;elf from the Scandal of &s;uch
<PB N="228" REF="233">
Sugge&s;tions, by telling them, that <HI>I cou'd &s;ee them
no more,</HI> and by de&s;iring them not to give them|&s;elves
the trouble of vi&s;iting me, who, tho' I
was not willing to be uncivil, yet thought my|&s;elf
oblig'd never to receive any Vi&s;it from any
Gentleman, after he had made &s;uch Proposals as
tho&s;e to me: But the&s;e things wou'd be too te|dious
to bring in here; it was on this Account
I propos'd to his Lord&s;hip my taking new Lodg|ings
for Privacy; be&s;ides I con&s;ider'd that as I might
live very hand&s;omely, and yet not &s;o publickly,
&s;o I needed not &s;pend &s;o much Money, by a great
deal; and if I made 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year of this generous
Per&s;on, it was more than I had any Occa&s;ion to
&s;pend, by a great deal.</P>
<P>My Lord came readily into this Propo&s;al, and
went farther than I expected; for he found out
a Lodging for me in a very hand&s;ome Hou&s;e,
where yet he was not known; I &s;uppo&s;e he had
employ'd &s;omebody to find it out for him; and
where he had a convenient Way to come into the
Garden, by a Door that open'd into the Park;
a thing very rarely allow'd in tho&s;e Times.</P>
<P>By this Key he cou'd come in at what time of
Night or Day he pleas'd; and as we had al&s;o a
little Door in the lower Part of the Hou&s;e, which
was always left upon a Lock, and his was the
Ma&s;ter-Key, &s;o if it was twelve, one, or two a-Clock
at Night, he cou'd come directly into my
Bed-Chamber. <HI>N. B.</HI> I was not afraid I &s;hou'd be
found a-Bed with any-body el&s;e, for, in a word,
I convers'd with no-body at-all.</P>
<P>It happen'd plea&s;antly enough one Night; his
Lord&s;hip had &s;taid late, and I not expecting him
that Night, had taken <HI>Amy</HI> to-Bed with me, and
when my Lord came into the Chamber, we were
both fa&s;t a&s;leep, I think it was near three a-Clock
<PB N="229" REF="234">
when he came in, and a little merry, but not at|all
&s;uddl'd, or what they call in Drink; and he
came at once into the Room.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was frighted out of her Wits, and cry'd
out; <HI>I &s;aid calmly,</HI> indeed my Lord, I did not ex|pect
yow to-Night, and we have been a little
frighted to-Night with Fire: O! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I &s;ee you
have got a Bedfellow with you; I began to make
an Apology, <HI>No? no, &s;ays my Lord,</HI> you need no Ex|cu&s;e,
'tis not a Man-Bedfellow I &s;ee; but then
talking merrily enough, he catch'd his Words
back; but hark-ye, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> now I think on't, how
&s;hall I be Satisfied it is not a Man-Bedfellow? O,
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I dare &s;ay your Lord&s;hip is &s;atisfy'd 'tis
poor <HI>Amy;</HI> yes, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> 'tis Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> but how
do I know what <HI>Amy</HI> is? It may be Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> for
ought I know; I hope you'll give me Leave to
be &s;atify'd: I told him, Yes, by all means I
wou'd have his Lord&s;hip &s;atisfy'd, but I &s;uppos'd
he knew who &s;he was.</P>
<P>Well, he fell foul of poor <HI>Amy,</HI> and indeed, I
thought once he wou'd have carry'd the Je&s;t on
before my Face, as was once done in a like Ca&s;e;
but his Lord&s;hip was not &s;o hot neither; but he
wou'd know whether <HI>Amy</HI> was Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> or Mrs.
<HI>Amy</HI> and &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e he did; and then being &s;a|tisfy'd
in that doubtful Ca&s;e, he walk'd to the
farther-end of the Room, and went into a little
Clo&s;et, and &s;at down.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Amy</HI> and I got up, and I bid
her run and make the Bed in another Chamber for
my Lord, and I gave her Sheets to put into it;
which &s;he did immediately, and I put my Lord
to-Bed there; and when I had done, at his De|&s;ire,
went to-Bed to him: I was backward at fir&s;t,
to come to-Bed to him, and made my Excu&s;e, be|cau&s;e
I had been in-Bed with <HI>Amy,</HI> and had not
<PB N="230" REF="235">
&s;hifted me, but he was pa&s;t tho&s;e Niceties at that
time; aud as long as he was &s;ure it was Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI>
and not Mr. <HI>Amy,</HI> he was very well &s;atisfy'd, and
&s;o the Je&s;t pa&s;s'd over; but <HI>Amy</HI> appear'd no
more all that Night, or the next Day, and when
&s;he did, my Lord was &s;o merry with her upon
his <HI>Ecclairici&s;&s;iment,</HI> as he call'd it, that <HI>Amy</HI> did
not know what to do with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Not that <HI>Amy</HI> was &s;uch a nice Lady in the main,
if &s;he had been fairly dealt with, as has appear'd
in the former Part of this Work; but now &s;he
was &s;urpriz'd, and a little hurried, that &s;he &s;carce
knew where &s;he was; and be&s;ides, &s;he was, as
to his Lord&s;hip, as nice a Lady as any in the
World, and for any-thing he knew of her, &s;he
appear'd as &s;uch; the re&s;t was to us only that
knew of it.</P>
<P>I held this wicked Scene of Life out eight Years,
$eckoning from my fir&s;t coming to <HI>England;</HI> and
tho' my Lord found no Fault, yet I found, with|out
much examining, that any-one who look'd
in may Face, might &s;ee I was above twenty Years
old, and yet, without flattering my&s;elf, I carried
my Age, which was above Fifty, very well too.</P>
<P>I may venture to &s;ay, that no Woman ever liv'd
a Life like me, of &s;ix and twenty Years of Wick|edne&s;s,
without the lea&s;t Signals of Remor&s;e;
without any Signs of Repentance; or without &s;o
much us a Wi$h to put an End to it; I had &s;o
long habituated myself to a Life of Vice, that
really it appear'd to be no Vice to me; I went on
&s;mooth and plea&s;ant; I wallow'd in Wealth, and
it flow'd in upon me at &s;uch a Rate, having taken
the frugal Mea&s;ures that the good Knight di|rected;
&s;o that I had at the End of the eight
Years, two Thousand eight Hundred Pounds co|ming
Yearly in, of which I did not &s;pend one
<PB N="231" REF="236">
Penny, being maintain'd by my Allowance from
my Lord&mdash;, and more than maintain'd, by
above 200 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> for tho' he did not con|tract
for 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, as I made dumb Signs to
have it be, yet he gave me Money &s;o often, and
that in &s;uch large Parcels, that I had &s;eldom &s;o
little as &s;even to eight Hundred Pounds a Year
of him, one Year with another.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t go back here, after telling openly the
wicked things I did, to mention &s;omething, which
however, had the Face of doing good; I remember'd,
that when I went from <HI>England,</HI> which
was fifteen Years before, I had left five little Chil|dren,
turn'd out, as it were, to the wide World,
and to the Charity of their Father's Relati|ons;
the Elde&s;t was not fix Years old, for we had
not been marry'd full &s;even Years when their Fa|ther
went away.</P>
<P>After my coming to <HI>England,</HI> I was greatly de|&s;irous
to hear how things &s;tood with them; and
whether they were all alive or not; and in what
Manner they had been maintain'd; and yet I re|&s;olv'd
not to di&s;cover my&s;elf to them, in the lea&s;t;
or to let any of the People that had the breed|ing
of them up, know that there was &s;uch a-body
left in the World, as their Mother.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was the only-body I cou'd tru&s;t with &s;uch
a Commi&s;&s;ion, and I &s;ent her into <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI>
to the old Aunt, and to the poor Woman, that
were &s;o in&s;trumental in di&s;po&s;ing the Relations to
take &s;ome Care of the Children, but they were
both gone, dead and buried &s;ome Years; the next
Enquiry &s;he made, was at the Hou&s;e where &s;he
carry'd the poor Children, and turn'd them in at
the Door; when &s;he came there, &s;he found the
Hou&s;e inhabited by other People, &s;o that &s;he cou'd
make little or nothing of her Enquiries, and
<PB N="232" REF="237">
came back with an An&s;wer, that indeed, was no
An&s;wer to me, for it gave me no Satisfaction
at-all: I &s;ent her back to enquire in the Neigh|bourhood,
what was become of the Family that
liv'd in that Hou&s;e? and if they were remov'd,
where they liv'd? and what Circum&s;tances they
were in? and withal, if &s;he cou'd, what became
of the poor Children, and how they liv'd, and
where? how they had been treated? <HI>and the
like.</HI></P>
<P>She brought me back word, upon this &s;econd
going, that &s;he heard as to the Family, that the
Husband, who tho' but Uncle-in-Law to the Chil|dren,
had yet been kinde&s;t to them, was dead;
and that the Widow was left but in mean Circum|&s;tances,
that is to &s;ay, &s;he did not want, but
that &s;he was not &s;o well in the World as &s;he was
thought to be when her Husband was alive.</P>
<P>That as to the poor Children, two of them it
&s;eems, had been kept by her, that is to &s;ay, by
her Husband, while he liv'd, for that it was a|gain&s;t
her Will, that we all knew; but the hone&s;t
Neighbours pity'd the poor Children, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI>
heartily; for that their Aunt us'd them barba|rou&s;ly,
and made them little better than Servants
in the Hou&s;e, to wait upon her and her Children,
and &s;carce allow'd them Cloaths fit to wear.</P>
<P>The&s;e were, it &s;eems my Elde&s;t, and Third,
which were Daughters; the Second was a Son;
the Fourth a Daughter; and the Younge&s;t a Son.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h the melancholly Part of this Hi&s;tory
of my two unhappy Girls, &s;he brought me word,
that as &s;oon as they were able to go out, and get
any Work, they went from her; and &s;ome &s;aid,
&s;he had turn'd them out of Doors; but it &s;eems
&s;he had not done &s;o, but &s;he us'd them &s;o cruelly
that they left her; and one of them went to Ser|vice
<PB N="233" REF="238">
to a Neighbour's a little-way off, who knew
her, an hone&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Weaver's Wife, to whom
&s;he was Chamber-Maid, and in a little time &s;he
took her Si&s;ter out of the <HI>Bridewell</HI> of her Aunt's
Hou&s;e, and got her a Place too.</P>
<P>This was all melancholly and dull; I &s;ent her
then to the Weaver's Hou&s;e, where the Elde&s;t had
liv'd, but found that her Mi&s;tre&s;s being dead, &s;he
was gone, and no-body knew there, whither &s;he
went; only that they heard &s;he had liv'd with a
great Lady at the other-end of the Town; but
they did not know who that Lady was.</P>
<P>The&s;e Enquiries took us up three or four Weeks,
and I was not one Jot the better for it, for I cou'd
hear nothing to my Satisfaction; I &s;ent her next to
find out the hone&s;t Man, who, as in the Beginning
of my Story I ob&s;erv'd made them be entertain'd,
and caus'd the Younge&s;t to be fetch'd from the
Town where we liv'd, and where the Pari&s;h-Of|ficers
had taken Care of him: This Gentleman
was &s;till alive; and there &s;he heard that my young|e&s;t
Daugher and elde&s;t Son was dead al&s;o; but
that my younge&s;t Son was alive, and was at that
time, about 17 Years old; and that he was put
out Apprentice, by the Kindne&s;s and Charity of
his Uncle, but to a mean Trade, and at which lie
was oblig'd to work very hard.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was &s;o curious in this Part, that &s;he went
immediately to &s;ee him, and found him all-dirty,
and hard at-work; &s;he had no remembrance at-all
of the Youth, for &s;he had not &s;een him &s;ince he
was about two Years old; and it was evident $word$
cou'd have no Knowledge of her.</P>
<P>However, &s;he talk'd with him, and found him a
good &s;en&s;ible mannerly Youth; that he knew little
of the Story of his Father or Mother, and had no
View of any-thing, but to work hard for his Li|ving;
<PB N="234" REF="239">
and &s;he did not think fit to put any great
things into his Head, le&s;t it &s;hou'd take him off
of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and perhaps, make him turn giddy|headed,
and be good for nothing; but &s;he went
and found out that Kind Man, his Benefactor, who
had put him out; and finding him a plain well|meaning,
hone&s;t, and kind-hearted Man, &s;he o|pen'd
her Tale to him the ea&s;ier: She made a
long Story, how &s;he had a prodigious Kindne&s;s
for the Child, becau&s;e &s;he had the &s;ame for his
Father and Mother; told him, that &s;he was the
Servant-Maid that brought all of them to their
Aunt's Door, and run away and left them; to that
their poor Mother wanted Bread; and what came
of her after, &s;he wou'd have been glad to know;
&s;he added, that her Circum&s;tances had happen'd
to mend in the World; and that, as &s;he was in
Condition, &s;o &s;he was di&s;pos'd to &s;hew &s;ome Kind|ne&s;s
to the Children, if &s;he cou'd find them out.</P>
<P>He receiv'd her with all the Civility that &s;o
kind a Propo&s;al demanded; gave her an Account
what he had done for the Child; how he had
maintain'd him, fed and cloath'd him; put him
to School, and at la&s;t, put him out to a Trade;
<HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> he had indeed, been a Father to the
Child; but Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> 'tis a very laborious hard|working
Trade, and he is but a thin weak Boy;
that's true, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but the Boy cho&s;e the Trade,
and I a&s;&s;ure you, I gave 20 <HI>l.</HI> with him, and am
to find him Cloaths all his Apprentice&s;hip; and as
to its being a hard Trade, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that's the Fate
of his Circum&s;tances, poor Boy; I cou'd not well
do better for him.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, as you did all for him in Charity,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> it was exceeding well; but as my Re&s;o|lution
is to do &s;omething for him, I de&s;ire you
will, if po&s;&s;ible, take him away again, from that
<PB N="235" REF="240">
Place, where he works &s;o hard, for I cannot bear
to &s;ee the Child work &s;o very hard for his Bread,
and I will do &s;omething for him, that &s;hall make
him live without &s;uch hard Labour.</P>
<P>He &s;mil'd at that; I can indeed, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> take
him away, but then I mu&s;t lo&s;e my 20 <HI>l.</HI> that
I gave with him.</P>
<P>Well Sir, &s;aid <HI>Amy,</HI> I'll enable you to lo&s;e
that 20 <HI>l.</HI> immediately, and &s;o &s;he put her Hand
in her Pocket, and pulls out her Pur&s;e.</P>
<P>He begun to be a little amaz'd at her, and
looked her hard in the Face, and that &s;o very
much, that &s;he took Notice of it, and &s;aid, Sir,
I Fancy by your looking at me, you think you
know me, but I am a&s;&s;ur'd you do not, for I
never &s;aw your Face before; I think you
have done enough for the Child, and that you
ought to be acknowleg'd as a Father to him,
but you ought not to lo&s;e by your Kindne&s;s to
him, more than the Kindne&s;s of bringing him
up obliges you to; and therefore there's the
twenty Pound, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> and pray let him be
fetch'd away.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I will thank you for
the Boy, as well as for my &s;elf; but will you
plea&s;e to tell me, what I mu&s;t do with him.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> as you have been &s;o Kind to
keep him &s;o many Years, I beg you will take
him home again one Year more, and I'll bring
you an hundred Pound more, which I will de&s;ire
you to lay-out in Schooling and Cloaths for him,
and to pay you for his Board; perhaps I may
put him in a Condition to return your Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>He look'd pleas'd, but &s;urpriz'd very much,
and enquir'd of <HI>Amy,</HI> but with very great Re|&s;pect,
what he &s;hould go to School to learn? and
what Trade &s;he would plea&s;e to put him $$$|to?</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="241">
<HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, he &s;hould put him to learn a little
<HI>Latin,</HI> and then Merchants-Accounts; and to
write a good Hand, for &s;he would have him be
put to a <HI>Turkey</HI>-Merchant.</P>
<P>Madam, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I am glad for his &s;ake, to
hear you talk &s;o; but do you know that a
<HI>Turkey</HI>-Merchant will not take him under 4 or
500 Pounds?</P>
<P>Yes Sir, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I know it very well.</P>
<P>And, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that it will require as many
Thou&s;nds to let him up?</P>
<P>Yes Sir, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> I know that very well too;
and re&s;olving to talk very big, <HI>&s;he added,</HI> I have
no Children of my own, and I re&s;olve to make
him my Heir; and if ten Thou&s;and Pounds be re|quir'd
to &s;et him up, he &s;hall not want it; I was
but his Mother's Servant when he was born, and
I mourn'd heartily for the Di&s;a&s;ter of the Fa|mily;
and I always &s;aid, if ever I was worth any|thing
in the World, I wou'd take the Child for
my own, and I'll be as good as my Word now,
tho' I did not then fore&s;ee that it wou'd be with
me, as it has been &s;ince: And &s;o <HI>Amy</HI> told him a
long Story how &s;he was troubled for me; and
what &s;he wou'd give to hear whether I was dead
or alive, and what Circum&s;tances I was in; that
if &s;he cou'd but find me, if I was ever &s;o poor, &s;he
wou'd take Care of me, and make a Gentlewo|man
of me again.</P>
<P>He told her, That as to the Child's Mother, &s;he
had been reduc'd to the la&s;t Extremity, and was ob|lig'd
(as he &s;uppos'd &s;he knew) to &s;end the Children
all among her Husband's Friends; and if it had not
been for him, they had all been &s;ent to the Pari&s;h;
but that he oblig'd the other Relations to &s;hare
the Charge among them; that he had taken two,
whereof he had lo&s;t the elde&s;t, who died of the
<PB N="237" REF="242">
Small-Pox; but that he had been as careful of this,
as of his own, and had made very little Difference
in their breeding up; only that when he came to
put him out, he thought it was be&s;t for the Boy,
to put him to a Trade which he might &s;et-up in,
without a Stock; for otherwi&s;e his Time wou'd
be lo&s;t; and that as to his Mother, he had never
been able to hear one Word of her, no, not tho'
he had made the utmo&s;t Enquiry after her; that
there went a Report, that &s;he had drown'd her|&s;elf;
but that he cou'd never meet with any-body
that cou'd give him a certain Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> counterfeited a Cry for her poor Mi&s;tre&s;s;
told him, &s;he wou'd give any thing in the World
to &s;ee her, if &s;he was alive; and a great deal more
&s;uch-like Talk they had about that; then they
return'd to &s;peak of the Boy.</P>
<P>He enquir'd of her, why &s;he did not &s;eek after
the Child before, that he might have been brought
up from a younger Age, &s;uitable to what &s;he de|&s;ign'd
to do for him.</P>
<P>She told him, &s;he had been out of <HI>England,</HI>
and was but newly return'd from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI>
that &s;he had been out of <HI>England,</HI> and was but
newly return'd, was true; but the latter was fal&s;e,
and was put in to blind him, and provide again&s;t
farther Enquiries; for it was not a &s;trange thing
for young Women to go away poor to the
<HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and come home va&s;tly Rich; &s;o &s;he
went on with Directions about him; and both
agreed in this, that the Boy &s;hould by no means
be told what was intended for him, but only that
he &s;hould be taken home again to his Uncle's;
that his Uncle thought the Trade too hard for
him, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>About three Days after this, <HI>Amy</HI> goes again,
and carry'd him the hundred Pound &s;he promis'd
<PB N="238" REF="243">
him, but then <HI>Amy</HI> made quite another Figure
than &s;he did before; for &s;he went in my Coach,
with two Footmen after her, and dre&s;s'd very
fine al&s;o, with Jewells and a Gold Watch; and
there was indeed, no great Difficulty to make
<HI>Amy</HI> look like a Lady, for &s;he was a very hand|&s;ome
well-&s;hap'd Woman, and genteel enough;
the Coachman and Servants were particularly
order'd to &s;how her the &s;ame Re&s;pect as they
wou'd to me, and to call her Madam <HI>Collins,</HI> if
they were ask'd any Questions about her.</P>
<P>When the Gentleman &s;aw what a Figure &s;he
made, it added to the former Surprize, and he
entertain'd her in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful Manner
po&s;&s;ible; congratulated her Advancement in For|tune,
and particularly rejoyc'd that It &s;hould fall
to the poor Child's Lot to be &s;o provided for,
contrary to all Expectation.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy</HI> talk'd big, but very free and fami|liar;
told them &s;he had no Pride in her good-Fortune;
(and that was true enough for to give
<HI>Amy</HI> her due, &s;he was far from it, and was as
good-humour'd a Creature as ever liv'd) that
&s;he was the &s;ame as ever, and that &s;he always
lov'd this Boy, and was re&s;olv'd to do &s;omething
extraordinary for him.</P>
<P>Then &s;he pull'd out her Money, and paid him
down an hundred and twenty Pounds, which,
&s;he &s;aid, &s;he paid him, that he might be &s;ure
he &s;hould be no Lo&s;er by taking him Home
again, and that &s;he would come and &s;ee him again,
and talk farther about things with him, that &s;o
all might be &s;ettled for him, in &s;uch a Manner,
as the Accidents, &s;uch as Mortality, or any-thing
el&s;e, &s;hould make no Alteration to the Child's
Prejudice.</P>

At this Meeting, the Uncle brought his Wife
out, a good motherly, comely, grave Woman
who &s;poke very tenderly of the Youth, and as
it appear'd, had been very good to him, tho'
&s;he had &s;everal Children of her own: After a long
Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he put in a Word of her own; Ma|dam,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I am heartily glad of the good In|tentions
you have for this poor Orphan, and I re|joice
&s;incerely in it, for his &s;ake; but Madam,
you know, (I &s;uppo&s;e) that there are two Si&s;ters
alive too, may we not &s;peak a Word for them?
<HI>Poor Girls, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> they have not been &s;o kindly
us'd, as he has; and are turn'd out to the wide
World.</P>
<P>Where are they, Madam? <HI>&s;ays Amy.</HI></P>
<P>Poor Creatures, <HI>&s;ays the Gentlewoman,</HI> they are
out at Service; no-body knows where but them|&s;elves;
their Ca&s;e is very hard.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> tho', if I cou'd find
them, I would a&s;&s;i&s;t them; yet my Concern is for
my boy, <HI>as I call him,</HI> and I will put him into a
Condition to take Care of his Si&s;ters.</P>
<P>But, Madam, <HI>&s;ays the good compa&s;&s;ionate Creature,</HI>
he may not be &s;o charitable perhaps, by his own
Inclination, for Brothers are not Fathers; and they
have been cruelly us'd already, poor Girls; we
have often reliev'd them, both with Victuals and
Cloaths too, even while they were pretended to be
kept by their barbarous Aunt.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> what can I do for
them; they are gone, it &s;eems, and cannot be
heard of? When I &s;ee them, 'tis time enough.</P>
<P>She pre&s;s'd <HI>Amy</HI> then, to oblige their Brother,
out of the plentiful Fortune he was like to have,
to do &s;omething for his Si&s;ters, when, he &s;hould
be able.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="245">
<HI>Amy</HI> &s;poke coldly of that &s;till, but &s;aid, &s;he
would con&s;ider of It; and &s;o they parted for that
time; they had &s;everal Meetings after this, for <HI>Amy</HI>
went to &s;ee her adopted Son, and order'd his School|ing,
Cloaths, and other things, but enjoin'd them
not to tell the Young-Man any-thing, but that
they thought the Trade he was at, too hard for
him, and they wou'd keep him at-home a little
longer, and give him &s;ome Schooling, to fit him
for better Bu&s;ine&s;s; and <HI>Amy</HI> appear'd to him as
&s;he did before, only as one that had known his
Mother, and had &s;ome Kindne&s;s for him.</P>
<P>Thus this Matter pa&s;s'd on for near a Twelve|month,
when it happen'd, that one of my Maid-Servants
having ask'd <HI>Amy</HI> Leave, for <HI>Amy</HI> was
Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Servants, and took, and put-out
&s;uch as &s;he pleas'd; I &s;ay, having ask'd Leave to
go into the City, to &s;ee her Friends, came Home
crying bitterly, and in a mo&s;t grievous Agony
&s;he was, and continued &s;o &s;everal Days, till <HI>Amy</HI>
perceiving the Exce&s;s, and that the Maid wou'd
certainly cry her&s;elf Sick; &s;he took an Opportunity
with her, and examin'd her about it.</P>
<P>The Maid told her a long Story, that &s;he had
been to &s;ee her Brother, the only Brother &s;he had
in the World; and that &s;he knew he was put-out
Apprentice to a&mdash;; but there had come a
Lady in a Couch, to his Uncle&mdash;, who had
brought him up, and made him take him Home
again; and &s;o the Wench run-on with the whole
Story, ju&s;t as 'tis told above, till &s;he came to
that Part that belong'd to her&s;elf; and there, <HI>&s;ays
&s;he,</HI> I had not let them know where I liv'd; and
the Lady wou'd have taken me, and they &s;ay,
wou'd have provided for me too, as &s;he has done
for my Brother, but no-body cou'd tell where to
find me, and &s;o I have lo&s;t it all, and all the Hopes
<PB N="241" REF="246">
of being any-thing, but a poor Servant all my
Days; and then the Girl fell a-crying again.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid, what's all this Story? who cou'd
this Lady be? it mu&s;t be &s;ome Trick &s;ure? No,
<HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> it was not a Trick, for &s;he had made
them, take her Brother home from Apprentice,
and bought him new Cloaths, and put him to
have more Learning; and the Gentlewoman &s;aid
&s;he wou'd make him her Heir.</P>
<P>Her Heir! <HI>&s;ays Amy;</HI> what does that amount
to; it may be &s;he had nothing to leave him; &s;he
might make any-body her Heir.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>&s;ays the Girl,</HI> &s;he came in a fine Coach
and Hor&s;es, and I don't know how-many Footmen
to attend her, and brought a great Bag of Gold,
and gave it to my Uncle&mdash;, he that brought
up my Brother, to buy him Cloaths, and to pay
for his Schooling and Board.</P>
<P>He that brought up your Brother? <HI>&s;ays Amy;</HI>
why, did not he bring you up too, as well as your
Brother? Pray who brought you up then?</P>
<P>Here the poor Girl told a melancholly Story,
how an Aunt had brought-up her and her Si&s;ter,
and how barbarou&s;ly &s;he had us'd them, as we
have heard.</P>
<P>By this time <HI>Amy</HI> had her Head full enough,
and her Heart too; and did not know how to hold
it, or what to do, for &s;he was &s;atisfied that this
was no other than my own Daughter; for &s;he
told her all the Hi&s;tory of her Father and Mo|ther;
and how &s;he was carried by their Maid, to
her Aunt's Door, ju&s;t as is related in the begin|ning
of my Story.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> did not tell me this Story for a great|while;
nor did &s;he well know what Cour&s;e to take
in it; but as &s;he had Authority to manage every|thing
in the Family, &s;he took Occa&s;ion &s;ome time
<PB N="242" REF="247">
after, without letting me know any thing of it, to
find &s;ome&punc; Fault with the Maid, and turn her
away.</P>
<P>Her Rea&s;ons were good, tho' at fir&s;t I was not
pleas'd when I heard of it, but I was convinc'd
afterwards, that &s;he was in the right; for if &s;he
had told me of it, I &s;hou'd have been in great
Perplexity between the Difficulty of concealing
my&s;elf from my own Child, and the Inconveni|ence
of having my Way of Living be known a|mong
my Fir&s;t Husband's Relations, and even to
my Husband him&s;elf; for as to his being dead at
<HI>Paris, Amy</HI> &s;eeing me re&s;olv'd again&s;t marrying
any-more, had told me, that &s;he had form'd that
Story only to make me ea&s;ie, when I was in <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
if any-thing &s;hould offer to my liking.</P>
<P>However, I was too tender a Mother &s;till, not|with&s;tanding
what I had done, to let this poor
Girl go about the World drudging, as it were,
for Bread, and &s;laving at the Fire, and in the Kit|chin,
as a Cook-Maid; be&s;ides it came into my
Head, that &s;he might, perhaps, marry &s;ome poor
Devil of a Footman, or a Coachman, or &s;ome
&s;uch thing, and be undone that way; or, which
was wor&s;e, be drawn in to lie with &s;ome of that
cour&s;e cur&s;ed Kind, and be with-Child, and be
utterly ruin'd that way; and in the mid&s;t of all
my Pro&s;perity this gave me great Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>As to &s;ending <HI>Amy</HI> to her, there was no doing
that now; for as &s;he had been Servant in the
Hou&s;e, &s;he knew <HI>Amy,</HI> as well as <HI>Amy</HI> knew me;
and no doubt, tho' I was much out of her Sight,
yet &s;he might have had the Curio&s;ity to have
peep'd at me, and &s;een me enough to know me
again, if I had di&s;cover'd my&s;elf to her &s;o that,
in &s;hort, there was nothing to be done that way.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="248">
However, <HI>Amy,</HI> a diligent indefatigable Creature,
found out another Woman, and gave her her Er|rand,
and &s;ent her to the hone&s;t Man's Hou&s;e in
<HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> whither &s;he &s;uppos'd the Girl wou'd
go, after &s;he was out of her Place; and bade her
talk with her, and tell her at a di&s;tance, that as
&s;omething had been done for her Brother, &s;o &s;ome|thing
wou'd be done for her too; and that &s;he
&s;hou'd not be di&s;courag'd, &s;he carried her 20 <HI>l.</HI> to
buy her Cloaths, and bid her not go to Service any|more,
but think of other things; that &s;he &s;hou'd
take a Lodging in &s;ome good Family, and that &s;he
&s;hou'd &s;oon hear farther.</P>
<P>The Girl was overjoy'd with this News, you
may be &s;ure, and at fir&s;t a little too much elevated
with it, and dre&s;s'd her&s;elf very hand&s;omely in|deed,
and as &s;oon as &s;he had done &s;o, came and
paid a Vi&s;it to Madam <HI>Amy,</HI> to let her &s;ee how
fine &s;he was: <HI>Amy</HI> congratulated her, and wi&s;h'd
it might be all as &s;he expected; but admoni&s;h'd
her not to be elevated with it too much; told
her, Humility was the be&s;t Ornament of a Gentle|woman;
and a great deal of good Advice &s;he gave
her, but di&s;cover'd nothing.</P>
<P>All this was acted in the fir&s;t Years of my &s;et|ting-up
my new Figure here in Town, and while
the Masks and Balls were in Agitation; and <HI>Amy</HI>
carried on the Affair of &s;etting-out my Son into
the World, which we were a&s;&s;i&s;ted in by the &s;age
Advice of my faithful Coun&s;ellor, Sir <HI>Robert Clay|ton,</HI>
who procur'd us a Ma&s;ter for him, by whom
he was afterwards &s;ent Abroad to <HI>Italy,</HI> as you
&s;hall hear in its Place; and <HI>Amy</HI> manag'd my
Daughter too, very well, tho' by a third hand.</P>
<P>My Amour with my Lord&mdash;began now
to draw to an end, and indeed, notwith&s;tanding
his Money, it had la&s;ted &s;o long, that I was much
<PB N="244" REF="249">
more &s;ick of his Lord&s;hip, than he cou'd be of
me; he grew old, and $retful, and captious, and
I mu&s;t add, which made the Vice it&s;elf begin to
grow $ur$eiting and nauceous to me, he grew wor&s;e
and wickeder the older he grew, and that to &s;uch
Degree, as is not fit to write of; and made me &s;o
weary of him, that upon one of his capricious
Humours, which he often took Occa&s;ion to trou|ble
me with, I took Occa&s;ion to be much le&s;s com|plai&s;ant
to him than I us'd to be; and as I knew
him to be ha&s;ty, I fir&s;t took care to put him into
a little Pa&s;&s;ion, and then to re&s;ent it, and this
brought us to Words; in which I told him, I
thought he grew &s;ick of me; and he an&s;wer'd, in
a heat, that <HI>truly &s;o he was;</HI> I an&s;wer'd, that I
$ound his Lord&s;hip was endeavouring to <HI>make me
&s;ick too;</HI> that I had met with &s;everal &s;uch Rubs
from him of late; and that he did not u&s;e me as
he us'd to do; and I begg'd his Lord&s;hip, he
wou'd make him&s;elf ea&s;ie: This I &s;poke with an
Air of Coldne&s;s and Indifference, &s;uch as I knew
he cou'd not bear; but I did not downright quar|rel
with him, and tell him <HI>I was &s;ick of him too,</HI> and
de&s;ire him to quit me, for I knew that wou'd
come of it&s;elf; be&s;ides, I had receiv'd a great-deal
of hand&s;ome U&s;age from him, and I was loth to
have the Breach be on my Side, that he might
not be able to &s;ay I was ungrateful.</P>
<P>But he put the Occa&s;ion into my Hands, for he
came no more to me for two Months; indeed I
expected a Fit of Ab&s;ence, for &s;uch I had had
&s;everal time before, but not for above a Fort|night
or three-Weeks at mo&s;t: But after I had
&s;taid a Month, which was longer than ever he
kept away yet, I took a new Method with him,
for I was re&s;olv'd now it &s;hou'd be in my Power
to continue, or not, as I thought $it; at the end
<PB N="245" REF="250">
of a Month therefore, I remov'd, and took Lodg|ings
at <HI>Ken&s;ington Gravel-Pitts,</HI> and that Part next
to the Road to <HI>Acton,</HI> and left no-body in my
Lodgings but <HI>Amy</HI> and a Footman; with proper
In&s;tructions how to behave, when his Lord&s;hip
being come to him&s;elf, &s;hou'd think fit to come
again, which I knew he wou'd.</P>
<P>About the end of two Months, he came in the
Dusk of the Evening, as u&s;ual; the Footman an|&s;wer'd
him, and told him, his Lady was not at|home,
but there was Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> above; &s;o he did
not order her to be call'd down, but went up-Stairs
into the Dining-Room, and Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> came
to him; he ask'd where I was? My Lord, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he,</HI> my Mi&s;tre&s;s has been remov'd a good-while,
from hence, and lives at <HI>Ken&s;ington:</HI> Ay, Mrs. <HI>Amy!</HI>
how come you to be here then? My Lord, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he,</HI> we are here till the Quarter-Day, becau&s;e the
Goods are not remov'd, and to give An&s;wers, if
any comes to ask for my Lady: Well, and what
An&s;wer are you to give to me? Indeed, my Lord,
<HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> I have no particular An&s;wer to your
Lord&s;hip, but to tell you, and every-body el&s;e,
where my Lady lives, that they may not think
&s;he's run away: No, Mrs. <HI>Amy, &s;ays he,</HI> I don't
think &s;he's run away, but indeed, I can't go after
her &s;o far as that; <HI>Amy</HI> &s;aid nothing to that, but
made a Curt&s;ie, and &s;aid, &s;he believ'd I wou'd be
there again for a Week or two, in a little time:
How little time, Mrs. <HI>Amy? &s;ays my Lord:</HI> She
comes next <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Amy:</HI> Very well, &s;ays my
Lord, I'll call and &s;ee her then; and &s;o he went
away.</P>
<P>Accordingly I came on the <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> and &s;taid a
Fortnight, but he came not; &s;o I went back to
<HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> and after that, I had very few of his
Lord&s;hip's Vi&s;its, which I was very glad of, and
<PB N="246" REF="251">
in a little time after was more glad of it, than I
was at fir&s;t, and upon a far better Account too,</P>
<P>For now I began not to be &s;ick of his Lord&s;hip
only, but really I began to be &s;ick of the Vice;
and as I had good Lei&s;ure now to divert and en|joy
my&s;elf in the World, as much as it was po&s;|&s;ible
for any Woman to do, that ever liv'd in it;
&s;o I $ound that my Judgment began to prevail up|on
me to fix my Delight upon nobler Objects than
I had formerly done; and the very beginning of
this brought &s;ome ju&s;t Reflections upon me, rela|ting
to things pa&s;t, and to the former Manner of
my living; and tho' there was not the lea&s;t Hint
in all this, from what may be call'd Religion or
Con&s;cience, and far from any-thing of Repentance,
or any-thing that was a-kin to it, e&s;pecially at fir&s;t;
yet the Sence of things, and the Knowledge I
had of the World, and the va&s;t Variety of Scenes
that I had acted nay Part in, began to work up|on
my Sences, and it came &s;o very &s;trong upon
my Mind one Morning, when I had been lying
awake &s;ome time in my Bed, as if &s;omebody had
ask'd me the Que&s;tion, <HI>What was I a Whore for now?</HI>
It occurr'd naturally upon this Enquiry, that at
fir&s;t I yielded to the Importunity of my Circum|&s;tances,
the Mi&s;ery of which, the Devil di&s;mal|ly
aggravated, to draw me to comply; for I
confe&s;s, I had &s;trong Natural Aver&s;ions to the
Crime at fir&s;t, partly owing to a virtuous Educa|tion,
and partly to a Sence of Religion; but the
Devil, and that greater Devil of Poverty, pre|vail'd;
and the Per&s;on who laid Siege to me, did
it in &s;uch an obliging, and I may almo&s;t &s;ay, irre|&s;i&s;tible
Manner, all &s;till manag'd by the Evil Spi|rit;
for I mu&s;t be allow'd to believe, that he has
a Share in all &s;uch thing, if not the whole Ma|nagement
of them: But, I &s;ay, it was curried on
<PB N="247" REF="252">
by that Per&s;on, in &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible Manner, that,
(as I &s;aid when I related the Fact) there was no
with&s;tanding it: The&s;e Circum&s;tances, I &s;ay, the
Devil manag'd, not only to bring me to comply,
but he continued them as Arguments to fortifie
my Mind again&s;t all Reflection, and to keep me
in that horrid Cour&s;e I had engag'd in, as if it
were hone&s;t and lawful.</P>
<P>But not to dwell upon that now; this was a Pre|tence,
and here was &s;omething to be &s;aid, tho'
I acknowledge, it ought not to have been &s;uffici|ent
to me at all; but, I &s;ay, to leave that, all
this was out of Doors; the Devil him&s;elf cou'd
not form one Argument, or put one Rea&s;on into
my Head <HI>now,</HI> that cou'd &s;erve for an An&s;wer, no,
nor &s;o much as a pretended An&s;wer to this Que|&s;tion,
<HI>Why I &s;hou'd be a Whore now?</HI></P>
<P>It had for a-while been a little kind of Excu&s;e
to me, that I was engag'd with this wicked old
Lord, and that I cou'd not, in Honour, for&s;ake
him; but how fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd did it look, to
repeat the Word Honour on &s;o vile an Occa&s;ion?
As if a Woman &s;hou'd pro&s;titute her Honour in
Point of Honour; horrid Incon&s;i&s;tency; Honour
call'd upon me to dete&s;t the Crime and the Man
too, and to have re&s;i&s;ted all the Attacks which
from the beginning had been made upon my Vir|tue;
and Honour, had it been con&s;ulted, wou'd
have pre&s;erv'd me hone&s;t from the Beginning.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>For HONESTY and HONOUR, are the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>This, however, &s;hews us with what faint Excu&s;es,
and with what Trifles we pretend to &s;atisfie our|&s;elves,
and &s;uppre&s;s the Attempts of Con&s;cience
in the Pur&s;uit of agreeable Crime, and in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
tho&s;e Plea&s;ures which we are loth to part
with.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="253">
But this Objection wou'd now &s;erve no longer;
for my Lord had, in &s;ome &s;ort, broke his En|gagements
(<HI>I won't call it Honour again</HI>) with me,
and had &s;o far &s;lighted me, as fairly to ju&s;tifie
my entire quitting of him now; and &s;o, as the
Objection was fully an&s;wer'd, the Que&s;tion re|main'd
&s;till unan&s;wer'd, <HI>Why am I a Whore now?</HI>
Nor indeed, had I any-thing to &s;ay for my&s;elf,
<HI>even to my&s;elf;</HI> I cou'd not without blu&s;hing, as
wicked as I was, an&s;wer, that I lov'd it for the
&s;ake of the Vice, and that I delighted in being a
Whore, <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> I &s;ay, I cou'd not &s;ay this, even
to my&s;elf <HI>and all alone,</HI> nor indeed, wou'd it have
been true; I was never able in Ju&s;tice, and with
Truth, to &s;ay I was &s;o wicked as that; but as Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
fir&s;t debauch'd me, and Poverty made me
a Whore at the Beginning; &s;o exce&s;s of Avarice
for getting Money, and exce&s;s of Vanity, conti|nued
me in the Crime, not being able to re&s;i&s;t
the Flatteries of Great Per&s;ons; being call'd the
fine&s;t Woman in <HI>France;</HI> being care&s;s'd by a
Prince; and afterwards I had Pride enough to
expect, and Folly enough to believe, tho' in|deed
without ground, by a Great Monarch:
The&s;e were my Baits, the&s;e the Chains by which
the Devil hold me bound; and by which I was
indeed, too fa&s;t h$ld for any Rea&s;oning that I
was then Mi&s;tre&s;s of, to deliver me from.</P>
<P>But this was all over now; Avarice cou'd
have no $word$; I was out of the reach of all
that $ate could be &s;uppo&s;'d to do to reduce me;
now I was &s;o $word$ from Poor, or the Danger of
it, that I had fifty Thou&s;and Pounds in my Poc|ket
at lea&s;t; $ay, I had the Income of fifty Thou|sand
Pounds; for I had 2500 <HI>l.</HI> a year coming

<PB N="249" REF="254">
Occa&s;ions, and be&s;ides Jewels and Plate,

the&s;e put together, when I ruminated on it all in my
Thoughts, as you may be &s;ure I did often, ad|ded
Weight &s;till to the Que&s;tion, as above, and
it &s;ounded continually in my Head, what's next?
<HI>What am I a Whore for now?</HI></P>
<P>It is true, this was, as I &s;ay, &s;eldom out of
my Thoughts, but yet it made no Impre&s;&s;ions
upon me of that Kind which might be expected
from a Reflection of &s;o important a Nature, and
which had &s;o much of Sub&s;tance and Seriou&s;ne&s;s
in it.</P>
<P>But however, it was not without &s;ome little
Con&s;equences, even at that time, and which gave
a little Turn to my Way of Living at fir&s;t, as
you &s;hall hear in its Place.</P>
<P>But one particular thing interven'd be&s;ides this,
which gave me &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s at this time, and
made way for other things that follow'd: I have
mention'd in &s;everal little Digre&s;&s;ions, the Concern
I had upon me for my Children, and in wh$$
Manner I had directed that Affair; I mu&s;t go
on a little with that Part, in order to bring the
&s;ub&s;equent Parts of my Story together.</P>
<P>My Boy, the only Son I had left, that I had a
legal Right to call Son, was, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> $word$
from the unhappy Circum&s;tances of being Ap|prentice
to a Mechanick, and was brought-up upon
a new foot; but tho' this was infinitely to $word$
Advantage, yet it put him back near three Years
in his coming into the World, for he had been
near a Year at the Drudgery he was fir&s;t put to,
and it took up two Year more to form him fo$
what he had Hopes given him he &s;hou'd hereafter
be, &s;o that he was full 19 Years old, or rather
20 years, before he came to be put-out as I in|tended;
<PB N="350" REF="255">
at the end of which time, I put him to
a very flouri&s;hing <HI>Italian</HI> Merchant, and he again
&s;ent him to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> in the I&s;land of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and
a little before the Juncture I am now &s;peaking of,
I had Letters from him, that as to &s;ay, Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI>
had Letters from him, intimating, that he was
out of his Time, and that he had an Opportu|nity
to be taken into an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e there, on
very good Terms, if his Support from hence
might an&s;wer what he was bid to hope for; and
&s;o begg'd, that what wou'd be done for him,
might be &s;o order'd, that he might have it for
his pre&s;ent Advancement, referring for the Par|ticulars
to his Ma&s;ter, the Merchant in <HI>Landon,</HI>
who he had been put Apprentice to here; who,
to cut the Story &s;hort, gave &s;uch a &s;atisfactory
Account of it, and of my Young-Man, to my
&s;teddy and faithful Coun&s;ellor, Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI>
that I made no Scruple to pay 4000 <HI>l.</HI> which was
1000 <HI>l.</HI> more than he demanded, or rather pro|pos'd,
that he might have Encouragement to en|ter
into the World better than he expected.</P>
<P>His Ma&s;ter remitted the Money very faithfully
to him, and finding by Sir <HI>Robert Clayton,</HI> that the
young Gentleman, for &s;o he call'd him, was well
&s;upported, wrote &s;uch Letters on his Account, as
gave him a Credit at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> equal in Value to
to the Money it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I cou'd not dige&s;t it very well, that I &s;hou'd
all this while conceal my&s;elf thus from my own
Child, and make all this Favour due, in his Opi|nion,
to a Stranger; and yet I cou'd not find in
my Heart to let my Son know what a Mother
he had, and what a Life &s;he liv'd; when at the
&s;ame time that he mu&s;t think him&s;elf infinitely
oblig'd to me, he mu&s;t be oblig'd, if he was a
Man of Virtue, to hate his Mother, and abhor
<PB N="251" REF="256">
the Way of Living, by which all the Bounty
he enjoy'd, was rais'd.</P>
<P>This is the Rea&s;on of mentioning this Part of
my Son's Story, which is otherwi&s;e no ways con|cern'd
in my Hi&s;tory, but as it put me upon think|ing
how to put an End to that wicked Cour&s;e $
was in, that my own Child, when he &s;hou'd af|terwards
come to <HI>England</HI> in a good Figure, and
with the Appearance of a Merchant, &s;hou'd not
be a&s;ham'd to own me.</P>
<P>But there was another Difficulty, which lay
heavier upon me a great-deal, and that was, my
Daughter; who, as before, I had reliev'd by the
Hands of another In&s;trument, which <HI>Amy</HI> had
procur'd: The Girl, as I have mention'd, was di|rected
to put her&s;elf into a good Garb, take
Lodging, and entertain a Maid to wait upon
her, and to give her&s;elf &s;ome Breeding, that is to
&s;ay, to learn to Dance, and $it her&s;elf to appear
as a Gentlewoman; being made to hope, that &s;he to
&s;hou'd, &s;ometime or other, find that &s;he &s;hou'd
be put into a Condition to &s;upport her Character&punc;
and to make her&s;elf amends for all her former
Troubles; &s;he was only charg'd not to be drawn
into Matrimony, till &s;he was &s;ecur'd of a For|tune
that might a&s;&s;i&s;t to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf &s;ui|table
not to what &s;he then was, but what &s;he was
to be.</P>
<P>The Girl was too &s;en&s;ible of her Circum&s;tan|ces,
not to give all po&s;&s;ible Satisfaction of that
Kind, and indeed, &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of too much
Under&s;tanding, not to &s;ee how much &s;he &s;hou'd
be oblig'd to that Part, for her own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It was not long after this, but being well e|quipp'd,
and in every-thing well &s;et-out, as &s;he
was directed, &s;he came, as I have related above,
and paid a Vi&s;it to Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and to tell her $word$
<PB N="252" REF="257">
her good Fortune: <HI>Amy</HI> pretended to be much &s;ur|priz'd
at the Alteration, and overjoy'd for her &s;ake,
and began to treat her very well, entertain'd her
hand&s;omely, and when &s;he wou'd have gone away,
pretended to ask my Leave, and &s;ent my Coach
home with her; and in &s;hort, learning from her
where &s;he lodg'd, which was in the City, <HI>Amy</HI>
promis'd to return her Vi&s;it, and did &s;o; and in
a word, <HI>Amy</HI> and SUSAN, (for &s;he was my own
Name) began an intimate Acquaintance together.</P>
<P>There was an inexpre&s;&s;ible Difficulty in the
poor Girl's way, or el&s;e I &s;hou'd not have been
able to have forborn di&s;covering my&s;elf to her,
and this was, her having been a Servant in my
particular Family; and I cou'd by no means think
of ever letting the Children know what a kind of
Creature they ow'd their Being to, or giving them
an Occa&s;ion to upbraid their Mother with her
&s;candalous Life, much le&s;s to ju&s;tifie the like Pra|ctice
from my Example.</P>
<P>Thus it was with me; and thus, no doubt, con|&s;idering
Parents always find it, that their own
Children are a Re&s;traint to them in their wor&s;t
Cour&s;es, when the Sence of a Superiour Power
has not the &s;ame Influence: <HI>But of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>There happen'd however, one good Circum|&s;tance
in the Ca&s;e of this poor Girl, which brought
about a Di&s;covery &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e it wou'd
have been; and it was thus: After &s;he and <HI>Amy</HI>
had been intimate for &s;ome time, and had ex|chang'd
&s;everal Vi&s;its, the Girl now grown a Wo|man,
talking to <HI>Amy</HI> of the gay things that us'd
to fall-out when &s;he was Servant in my Family,
&s;poke of it with a kind of Concern, that &s;he cou'd
not &s;ee [me] her Lady; and at la&s;t &s;he adds, <HI>'twas
very &s;trange:</HI> Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he to</HI> Amy, but tho' I
liv'd near two Years in the Hou&s;e, I never &s;aw my
<PB N="253" REF="258">
Mi&s;tre&s;s in my Life, except it was that publick
Night when &s;he danc'd in the fine <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Habit,
and then &s;he was &s;o di&s;guis'd, that I knew no|thing
of her afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was glad to hear this; but as &s;he was a
cunning Girl from the beginning, &s;he was not to
be Bit, and &s;o &s;he laid no Stre&s;s upon that, at fir&s;t,
but gave me an Account of it; and, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s,
it gave me a &s;ecret Joy, to think that I was
not known to her, and that, by virtue of that only
Accident, I might, when other Circum&s;tances
made room for it, di&s;cover my&s;elf to her, and let
her know &s;he had a Mother in a Condition fit to
be own'd.</P>
<P>It was a dreadful Re&s;traint to me before, and
this gave me &s;ome very &s;ad Reflections, and made
way for the great Que&s;tion I have mention'd above;
and by how much the Circum&s;tance was bitter to
me, by &s;o much the more agreeable it was, to
under&s;tand that the Girl had never &s;een me, and
con&s;equently, did not know me again, if &s;he was
to be told who I was.</P>
<P>However, the next time &s;he came to vi&s;it <HI>Amy,</HI>
I was re&s;olv'd to put it to a Tryal, and to come
into the Room, and let her &s;ee me, and to &s;ee by
that, whether &s;he knew me or no; but <HI>Amy</HI> put
me by, le&s;t indeed, as there was rea&s;on enough
to que&s;tion, I &s;hou'd not be able to contain, or
forbear di&s;covering my&s;elf to her; &s;o it went off
for that time.</P>
<P>But both the&s;e Circum&s;tances, and that is the
rea&s;on of mentioning them, brought me to con&s;i|der
of the Life I liv'd, and to re&s;olve to put my|&s;elf
into &s;ome Figure of Life, in which I might
not be &s;candalous to my own Family, and be a|fraid
to make my&s;elf known to my own Children,
who were my own Fle&s;h and Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="259">
There was another Daughter I had, which, with
all our Enquiries we cou'd not hear-of, high nor
low, for &s;everal Years after the fir&s;t: But I return
to my own Story.</P>
<P>Being now in part remov'd from my old Station,
I &s;eem'd to be in a fair Way of retiring from my
old Acquaintances, and con&s;equently from the vile
abominable Trade I had driven &s;o long; &s;o that
the Door &s;eem'd to be, as it were, particularly o|pen'd
to my Reformation, if I had any-mind to
it in earne&s;t; but for all that, &s;ome of my old
Friends, as I had us'd to call them, enquir'd me
out, and came to vi&s;it me at <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> and that
more frequently than I wi&s;h'd they would do;
but it being once known where I was, there was
no avoiding it, unle&s;s I wou'd have downright re|fus'd
and affronted them; and I was not yet in
Earne&s;t enough with my Resolutions, to go that
lengths.</P>
<P>The be&s;t of it was, my old lewd Favourite,
who I now heartily hated, entirely dropp'd me;
he came once to vi&s;it me, but I caus'd <HI>Amy</HI> to
deny me, and &s;ay I was gone out; &s;he did it &s;o
oddly too, that when his Lord&s;hip went away,
he &s;aid coldly to her, Well, well, Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> I
find your Mi&s;tre&s;s does not de&s;ire to be &s;een;
tell her I won't trouble her <HI>any-more,</HI> repeating the
Words <HI>any-more</HI> two or three times over, ju&s;t at his
going away.</P>
<P>I reflected a little on it at fir&s;t, as unkind to him,
having had &s;o many con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents from him;
but, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> I was &s;ick of him, and that on
&s;ome Accounts, which, if I cou'd &s;uffer my&s;elf to
publi&s;h them, wou'd fully ju&s;tifie my Conduct;
but that Part of the Story will not bear telling;
&s;o I mu&s;t leave it, and proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260">
I had begun a little, <HI>as I have &s;aid above,</HI> to re|flect
upon my Manner of Living, and to think of
putting a new Face upon it; and nothing mov'd
me to it more, than the Con&s;ideration; of my
having three Children, who were now grown up;
and yet, that while I was in that Station of Life,
I cou'd not conver&s;e with them, or make my&s;elf
Known to them; and this gave me a great-deal of
Unea&s;ine&s;s; at la&s;t I enter'd into Talk on this
Part of it, with my Woman, <HI>Amy.</HI></P>
<P>We liv'd at <HI>Ken&s;ington, as I have, &s;aid,</HI> and
though I had done with my old wicked L&mdash;,
as above, yet I was frequently vi&s;ited, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI>
by &s;ome others, &s;o that, in a word, I began to be
known in the Town, not by my Name only,
but by my Character too, which was wor&s;e.</P>
<P>It was one Morning when <HI>Amy</HI> was in-Bed
with me, and I had &s;ome of my dulle&s;t Thoughts
about me, that <HI>Amy</HI> hearing me &s;igh pretty often,
ask'd me if I was not well? Yes, <HI>Amy,</HI> I am
well enough, <HI>&s;ays</HI> I, but my Mind is oppre&s;s'd
with heavy Thoughts, and has been &s;o a good|while,
and then I told her how it griev'd me
that I cou'd not make my&s;elf known to my
own Children, or form any Accquaintances in the
World: Why &s;o? <HI>&s;ays Amy;</HI> Why prethee, <HI>Amy,
&s;ays I,</HI> what will my Children &s;ay to them&s;elves,
and to one another, when they find their Mo|ther,
however rich &s;he may be, is at be&s;t but a
Whore, a common Whore? And as for Accquaint|ance,
prethee <HI>Amy,</HI> what &s;ober Lady, or what
Family of any Character will vi&s;it or be ac|quainted
with a Whore?</P>
<P>Why, all that's true, Madam, &s;ays <HI>Amy;</HI> but
how can it be remedy'd now? 'Tis true <HI>Amy, &s;aid
I,</HI> the thing cannot be remedy'd now, but the
Scandal of it, I fancy, may be thrown off.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="261">
Truly, &s;ays <HI>Amy</HI> I do not &s;ee how, unle&s;s you
will go Abroad again, and live in &s;ome other
Nation, where no-body has known us, or &s;een
us, &s;o that they cannot &s;ay they ever &s;aw us
before.</P>
<P>That very Thought of <HI>Amy</HI> put what follows
into my Head; and I return'd, Why <HI>Amy, &s;ays
I,</HI> is it not po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;hift my Being,
from this Part of the Town, and go and live
in another Part of the City, or another Part of
the Country, and $e as entirely conceal'd as if
I had never been known?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> I believe it might; but then
you mu&s;t put off all your Equipages, and Ser|vants,
Coaches, and Hor&s;es; change your Li|veries,
nay, your own Cloaths, and if it was
po&s;&s;ible, your very Face.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and that's the way <HI>Amy,</HI> and that
I'll do, and that forthwith; for I am not able
to live in this Manner any longer: <HI>Amy</HI> came
into this with a kind of Plea&s;ure particular to
her&s;elf, that is to &s;ay, with an Eagerne&s;s not to
be re&s;i&s;ted; for <HI>Amy</HI> was apt to be precipitant
in her Motions, and was for doing it immedi|ately:
Well, <HI>&s;ays I, Amy,</HI> as &s;oon as you will,
but what Cour&s;e mu&s;t we take to do it? we
cannot put off Servants, and Coach and Hor&s;es,
and every-thing; leave off Hou&s;e-keeping, and
transform our&s;elves into a new Shape, all in a
Moment; Servants mu&s;t have Warning, and the
Goods mu&s;t be &s;old off, and a thou&s;and things,
and this began to perplex us, and in particular,
took us up two or three Days Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, <HI>Amy,</HI> who was a clever Manager in
&s;uch Ca&s;es, came to me with a Scheme, as &s;he
call'd it; I have found it out, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI>
I have found a Scheme how you &s;hall, if you
<PB N="257" REF="262">
have a-mind to it, begin, and fini&s;h a perfect
entire Change of your Figure and Circum&s;tances,
in one Day; and &s;hall be as much unknown,
Madam, in twenty-four Hours, as you wou'd be
in &s;o many Years.</P>
<P>Come <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> let us hear it, for you plea&s;e
me mightily with the Thoughts of it: Why then,
<HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> let me go into the City this Afternoon,
and I'll enquire out &s;ome hone&s;t, plain, &s;ober Fa|mily,
where I will take Lodgings for you, as for
a Country-Gentlewoman that de&s;ires to be in <HI>Lon|don</HI>
for about half a Year, and to Board your&s;elf
and a Kin&s;woman, that is half a Servant, half a
Companion, meaning my&s;elf; and &s;o agree with
them by the Month.</P>
<P>To this Lodging (if I hit upon one to your
Mind) you may go to-Morrow Morning, in a
Hackney-Coach, with no-body but me, and leave
&s;uch Cloaths and Linnen as you think fit; but to
be &s;ure, the plaine&s;t you have, and then you are
remov'd at once, you need never &s;o much as &s;et
your Foot in this Hou&s;e again, (meaning where
we then were) or &s;ee any-body belonging to it;
in the mean time I'll let the Servants know, that
you are going over to <HI>Holland</HI> upon extraordinary
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and will leave off your Equipages, and &s;o
I'll give them Warning, or, if they will accept of it,
give them a Month's Wages; then I'll &s;ell off your
Furniture as well as I can; as to your Coach, it
is but having it new-painted, and the Lining
chang'd, and getting new Harne&s;s and Hammer-Cloths,
and you may keep it &s;till, or di&s;po&s;e of
it, as you think fit; and only take care to let
this Lodging be in &s;ome remote Part of the Town,
and you may be as perfectly unknown, as if you
had never been in <HI>England</HI> in your Life.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="263">
This was <HI>Amy</HI>'s Scheme; and it pleas'd me &s;o
well, that I re&s;olv'd not only to let her go, but
was re&s;olv'd to go with her my&s;elf; but <HI>Amy</HI> put
me off of that, becau&s;e, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he &s;hou'd have
Occa&s;ion to hurry up-and-down &s;o long, that if
I was with her, it wou'd rather hinder than far|ther
her; &s;o I wav'd it.</P>
<P>In a word, <HI>Amy</HI> went, and was gone five long
Hours; but when &s;he came back, I cou'd &s;ee by
her Countenance, that her Succe&s;s had been &s;uita|ble
to her Pains; for &s;he came laughing and gaping,
O Madam! <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I have pleas'd you to the
Life; and with that, &s;he tells me how &s;he had
fix'd upon a Hou&s;e in a Court in the <HI>Minories;</HI>
that &s;he was directed to it meerly by Accident;
that it was a Female Family, the Ma&s;ter of the
Hou&s;e being gone to <HI>New-England;</HI> and that the
Woman had four Children; kept two Maids, and
liv'd very hand&s;omely, but wanted Company to
divert her; and that on that very account, &s;he had
agreed to take Boarders.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> agreed for a good hand&s;ome Price, becau&s;e
&s;he was re&s;olv'd I &s;hou'd be us'd well; &s;o &s;he
bargain'd to give her 35 <HI>l.</HI> for the Half-Year, and
50 <HI>l.</HI> if we took a Maid, leaving that to my choice;
and that we might be &s;atisfied we &s;hou'd meet
with nothing very gay; the People were QUAKERS,
and I lik'd them the better.</P>
<P>I was &s;o pleas'd, that I re&s;olv'd to go with <HI>Amy</HI> the
next Day to &s;ee the Lodgings, and to &s;ee the Wo|man
of the Hou&s;e, and &s;ee how I lik'd them; but
if I was pleas'd with the general, I was much more
pleas'd with the particulars; for the Gentlewoman,
I mu&s;t call her &s;o, tho' &s;he was a QUAKER, was
a mo&s;t courteous, obliging, mannerly Per&s;on; per|fectly
well-bred, and perfectly well-humour'd, and
in &s;hort, the mo&s;t agreeable Conver&s;ation that ever
<PB N="259" REF="264">
I met with; and which was worth all, &s;o grave,
and yet &s;o plea&s;ant and &s;o merry, that 'tis &s;carce
po&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s how I was pleas'd and
delighted with her Company; and particularly, I
was &s;o pleas'd, that I wou'd go away no more;
&s;o I e'en took up my Lodging there the very fir&s;t
Night.</P>
<P>In the mean time, tho' it took up <HI>Amy</HI> almo&s;t a
Month &s;o entirely, to put off all the Appearan|ces
of Hou&s;e-keeping, as above; it need take me
up no Time to relate it; 'tis enough to &s;ay, that
<HI>Amy</HI> quitted all that Part of the World, and came
Pack and Package to me, and here we took up
our Abode.</P>
<P>I was now in a perfect Retreat indeed; remote
from the Eyes of all that ever had &s;een me, and
as much out of the way of being ever &s;een or
heard-of by any of the Gang that us'd to follow
me, as if I had been among the Mountains in <HI>Lan|ca&s;hire;</HI>
for when did a Blue Garter, or a Coach-and-Six
come into a little narrow Pa&s;&s;age in the
<HI>Minories,</HI> or <HI>Goodman's-Fields?</HI> And as there was
no Fear of them, &s;o really I had no De&s;ire to &s;ee
them, or &s;o much as to hear from them any-more,
as long as I liv'd.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd in a little Hurry while <HI>Amy</HI> came and
went, &s;o every-Day, at fir&s;t; but when that was
over, I liv'd here perfectly retir'd, and with a mo&s;t
plea&s;ant and agreeable Lady; I mu&s;t call her &s;o,
for tho' a QUAKER, &s;he had a full Share of
good Breeding, &s;ufficient to her, if &s;he had been
a Dutche&s;s; in a word, &s;he was the mo&s;t agreeable
Creature in her Conver&s;ation, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI>
that ever I met with.</P>
<P>I pretended, after I had been there &s;ome time,
to be extreamly in Love with the Dre&s;s of the

QUAKER was gone out of the Room, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI>
I gue&s;s your Meaning; it is a perfect Di&s;gui&s;e to
you; why you look quite another-body, I &s;hou'd
not have known you my&s;elf; nay, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI> more
than that, it makes you look ten Years younger
than you did.</P>
<P>Nothing cou'd plea&s;e me better than that; and
when <HI>Amy</HI> repeated it, I was &s;o fond of it, that
I ask'd my QUAKER, (I won't call her Landlady,
'tis indeed, too cour&s;e a Word for her, and &s;he
de&s;erv'd a much better) I &s;ay, I ask'd her if &s;he
wou'd fell it; I told her, I was &s;o fond of it, that
I wou'd give her enough to buy her a better Suit;
&s;he declin'd it at fir&s;t, but I &s;oon perceiv'd that
it was chiefly in good Manners, becau&s;e I &s;hou'd
not di&s;honour my&s;elf, as &s;he call'd it, to put on
her old Cloaths; but if I pleas'd to accept of
them, &s;he wou'd give me them for my dre&s;&s;ing-Cloaths,
and go with me, and buy a Suit for me,
that might be better-worth my wearing.</P>
<P>But as I convers'd in a very frank open Manner
with her, I bid her do the like with me; that I
made no Scruples of &s;uch things; but that if &s;he
wou'd let me have them, I wou'd &s;atisfie her; &s;o
&s;he let me know what they co&s;t, and to make her
amends, I gave her three Guineas more than they
co&s;t her.</P>
<P>This good (tho' unhappy) QUAKER had the Mis|fortune
to have had a bad Husband, and he was
gone beyond-Sea; &s;he had a good Hou&s;e, and
well-furni&s;h'd, and had &s;ome Jointure of her own
E&s;tate, which &s;upported her and her Children, &s;o
<PB N="261" REF="266">
that &s;he did not want; but &s;he was not at-all above
&s;uch a Help, as my being there was to her; &s;o &s;he
was as glad of me, as I was of her.</P>
<P>However, as I knew there was no way to fix
this new Acquaintance, like making my&s;elf a Friend
to her, I began with making her &s;ome hand&s;ome
Pre&s;ents, and the like to her Children; and fir&s;t,
opening my Bundles one Day in my Chamber, I
heard her in another Room, and call'd her in, with
a kind of familiar way; there I &s;how'd her &s;ome of
my fine Cloaths, and having among the re&s;t of my
things, a Piece of very fine new Holland, which I
had bought a little before, worth about 9 <HI>s.</HI> an
Ell, I pull'd it out, <HI>Here, my Friend,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>I will
make you a Pre&s;ent, if you will accept of it;</HI> and with
that I laid the Piece of Holland in her Lap.</P>
<P>I cou'd &s;ee &s;he was &s;urpriz'd, and that &s;he
cou'd hardly &s;peak; <HI>What do&s;t thou mean?</HI> &s;ays
&s;he; <HI>indeed I cannot have the Face to accept &s;o fine a
Pre&s;ent as this;</HI> adding, <HI>'Tis fit for thy own &V;&s;e
but 'tis above my Wear, indeed:</HI> I thought &s;he had
meant &s;he mu&s;t not wear it &s;o fine, becau&s;e &s;he
was a QUAKER; &s;o I return'd, Why, do not
you QUAKERS wear fine Linnen neither? Yes,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> we wear fine Linnen when we can afford
it, but this is too good for me: However, I made
her take it, and &s;he was very thankful too; but my
End was an&s;wer'd another Way; for by this I en|gag'd
her &s;o, that as I found her a Woman of Un|der&s;tanding,
and of Hone&s;ty too, I might, upon
any Occa&s;ion, have a Confidence in her, which
was indeed, what I very much wanted.</P>
<P>By accu&s;toming my&s;elf to conver&s;e with her,
I had not only learn'd to dre&s;s like a QUAKER,
but &s;o us'd my&s;elf to THEE and THOU, that
I talk'd like a QUAKER too, as readily and naturally
as if I had been born among them; and, in a word,
<PB N="262" REF="267">
I pa&s;s'd for a QUAKER among all People that did
not know me; I went but little Abroad, but I had
been &s;o us'd to a Coach, that I knew not how well
to go without one; be&s;ides, I thought it wou'd
be a farther Di&s;gui&s;e to me, &s;o I told my Quaker-Friend
one Day, that I thought I liv'd too clo&s;e
that I wanted Air; &s;he propos'd taking a Hackney-Coach
&s;ometimes, or a Boat; but I told her, I
had always had a Coach of my own, till now,
and I cou'd find in my Heart to have one again.</P>
<P>She &s;eem'd to think it &s;trange at fir&s;t, con&s;ider|ing
how clo&s;e I liv'd, but had nothing to &s;ay when
&s;he found I did not value the Expence; &s;o in &s;hort,
I re&s;olv'd I wou'd have a Coach: When we came
to talk of Equipages; &s;he extoll'd the having all
things plain; I &s;aid &s;o too; &s;o I left it to her Di|rection,
and a Coach-Maker was &s;ent for, and he
provided me a plain Coach, no gilding or painting,
lin'd with a light-grey Cloath, and my Coachman
had a Coat of the &s;ame, and no Lace on his Hat.</P>
<P>When all was ready, I dre&s;s'd my&s;elf in the
Dre&s;s I bought of her, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> Come, I'll be a
QUAKER to-Day, and you and I'll go Abroad;
which we did, and there was not a QUAKER in the
Town look'd le&s;s like a Counterfeit than I did:
But all this was my particular Plot to be the more
compleatly conceal'd, and that I might depend
upon being not known, and yet need not be con|fin'd
like a Pri&s;oner, and be always in Fear; &s;o
that all the re&s;t was Grimace.</P>
<P>We liv'd here very ca&s;ie and quiet, and yet I
cannot &s;ay I was &s;o in my Mind; I was like a
Fi&s;h out of Water; I was as gay, and as young
in my Di&s;po&s;ition, as I was at five and twenty;
and as I had always been courted, flatter'd, and
us'd to love it, &s;o I mi&s;s'd it in my Conver&s;ation;
and this put me many times, upon looking-back up|on
on things pa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="268">
I had very few Moments in my Life, which
in their Reflection, afforded me any-thing but
Regret; but of all the fooli&s;h Actions I had to
look back upon in my Life, none look'd &s;o pre|po&s;terous,
and &s;o like Di&s;traction, nor left &s;o much
Mclancholly on my Mind, as my Parting with
my Friend, the <HI>Merchant of Paris,</HI> and the refu|&s;ing
him upon &s;uch honourable and ju&s;t Conditi|ons
as he had offer'd; and tho' on his ju&s;t (which
I call'd unkind) rejecting my Invitation to come
to him again, I had look'd on him with &s;ome
Di&s;gu&s;t, yet now my Mind run upon him continu|ally,
and the ridiculous Conduct of my refu&s;ing
him, and I cou'd never be &s;atified about him;
I flatter'd my&s;elf, that if I cou'd but &s;ee him, I
cou'd yet Ma&s;ter him, and that he wou'd pre&s;ently
forget all that had pa&s;s'd, that might be thought
unkind; but as there was no room to imagine
any-thing like that to be po&s;&s;ible, I threw tho&s;e
Thoughts off again as much as I cou'd.</P>
<P>However, they continually return'd, and I had
no Re&s;t Night or Day, for thinking of him, who
I had forgot above eleven Years. I told <HI>Amy</HI> of
<HI>it,</HI> and we talk'd it over &s;ometimes in-Bed, al|mo&s;t
whole Nights together; at la&s;t, <HI>Amy</HI> &s;tarted
a thing of her own Head, which put it in a Way of
Management, tho' a wild one too: <HI>You are &s;o
unea&s;ie, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> about this Mr.&mdash;,
the Merchant at</HI> Paris; <HI>Come,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>if you'll
give me Leave, I'll go over, and &s;ee what's become
of him.</HI></P>
<P>Not for ten Thou&s;and Pounds, <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> no, nor
if you met him in the Street, not to offer to &s;peak
to him on my Account: No, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> I wou'd
not &s;peak to him at-all, or if I did, I warrant you
it &s;hall not look to be upon your Account; I'll
only enquire after him, and if he is in Being,
<PB N="264" REF="269">
you &s;hall hear of it him; if not, you &s;hall hear
of him &s;till, and that may be enough.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> if you will promi&s;e me not to en|ter
into any-thing relating to me, with him; nor
to begin any Di&s;cour&s;e at-all, unle&s;s he begins it
with you, I cou'd almo&s;t, be per&s;waded to let you
go and try.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> promis'd me all that I de&s;ir'd; and, in a
word, to cut the Story &s;hort, I let her go; but ty'd
her up to &s;o many Particulars, that it was almo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible, her going cou'd &s;ignifie any-thing; and
had &s;he intended to ob&s;erve them, &s;he might as
well have &s;taid at-home as have gone; for I charg'd
her, if &s;he came to &s;ee him, &s;he &s;hou'd not &s;o
much as take Notice that &s;he knew him again; and
if he &s;poke to her, &s;he &s;hou'd tell him, &s;he was
come away from me a great-many Years ago, and
knew nothing what was become of me; that &s;he
had been come-over to <HI>France</HI> &s;ix Years ago, and
was marry'd there, and liv'd at <HI>Calais,</HI> or to that
Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> promis'd me nothing indeed; for, <HI>as &s;he
&s;aid,</HI> it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to re&s;olve what wou'd
be fit to do, or not to do, till &s;he was there, upon
the Spot, and had found out the Gentleman, or
heard of him; but that then, if I wou'd tru&s;t her,
as I had always done, &s;he wou'd an&s;wer for it, that
&s;he wou'd do nothing but what &s;hou'd be for my
Intere&s;t, and what &s;he wou'd hope I &s;hou'd be very
well pleas'd with.</P>
<P>With this general Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Amy,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding
&s;he had been &s;o frighted at the Sea, ven|tur'd
her Carca&s;s once more by Water, and away
&s;he goes to <HI>France;</HI> &s;he had four Articles of Con|fidence
in Charge to enquire after, for me; and as
I found by her, &s;he had one for her&s;elf; I &s;ay, four
for me, becau&s;e tho' her <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and principal Erran'd
<PB N="265" REF="270">
was, to inform her&s;elf of my <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant;
yet I gave her in Charge to enquire, 2. After my
Husband, who I left a Trooper in the <HI>Gensd' arms.</HI>
3. After that Rogue of a <HI>Jew,</HI> who&s;e very Name
I hated, and of who&s;e Face I had &s;uch a fright|ful
<HI>Idea,</HI> that <HI>Sathan</HI> him&s;elf cou'd not counter|feit
a wor&s;e: And <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> After my Foreign Prince:
And &s;he di&s;charg'd her&s;elf very well of them all,
tho' not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as I wi&s;h'd.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> had a very good Pa&s;&s;age over the Sea, and
I had a Letter from her, from <HI>Calais,</HI> in three
Days after &s;he went from <HI>London:</HI> When &s;he came
to <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;he wrote me an Account, that as to her
fir&s;t and mo&s;t important Enquiry, which was after
the <HI>Dutch <HI>Merchant;</HI></HI> her Account was, That he
had return'd to <HI>Paris;</HI> liv'd three Years there, and
quitting that City, went to live at <HI>Roan:</HI> So away
goes <HI>Amy</HI> for <HI>Roan.</HI></P>
<P>But as &s;he was going to be&s;peak a Place in the
Coach to <HI>Roan,</HI> &s;he meets very accidentally in the
Street, with her Gentleman, <HI>as I call'd him;</HI> that
is to &s;ay, the Prince <HI>de</HI>&mdash;'<HI>s</HI> Gentleman, who
had been her Favourite, <HI>as above.</HI></P>
<P>You may be &s;ure there were &s;everal other kind
Things happen'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and him, as you
&s;hall hear afterwards: But the two main things
were, 1. That <HI>Amy</HI> enquir'd about his Lord, and
had a full Account of him; of which pre&s;ently;
and in the next Place, telling him whither &s;he was
going, and for what; he bade her not go yet, for
that he wou'd have a particular Account of it the
next Day, from a Merchant that knew him; and
accordingly he brought her word the next Day,
that he had been for &s;ix Years before that, gone
for <HI>Holland,</HI> and that he liv'd there &s;till.</P>
<P>This, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> was the fir&s;t News from <HI>Amy,</HI> for
&s;ome time, <HI>I mean,</HI> about my Merchant: In the
<PB N="266" REF="271">
mean time, <HI>Amy, as I have &s;aid,</HI> enquir'd about
the other Per&s;ons &s;he had in her In&s;tructions: As
for the Prince, the Gentleman told her, he was gone
into <HI>Germany,</HI> where his E&s;tate lay, and that he
liv'd there; that he had made great Enquiry af|ter
me; that he (his Gentleman) had made all
the Search he had been able, for me; but that he
cou'd not hear of me; but that, he believ'd if his
Lord had known I had been in <HI>England,</HI> he wou'd
have gone over to me; but that, after long En|quiry,
he was oblig'd to give it over; but that
he verily believ'd, if he cou'd have found me, he
wou'd have married me; and that he was ex|tremely
concern'd that he cou'd hear nothing of me.</P>
<P>I was not at-all &s;atisfied with <HI>Amy's</HI> Account,
but order'd her to go to <HI>Roan</HI> her&s;elf; which &s;he
did, and there with much Difficulty, (the Per&s;on
&s;he was directed to being dead) I &s;ay, with much
Difficulty, &s;he came to be inform'd, that my Mer|chant
had liv'd there two Years, or &s;omething
more; but that having met with a very great
Misfortune, he had gone back to <HI>Holland, as the</HI>
French <HI>Merchant &s;aid,</HI> where he had &s;taid two
Years; but with this Addition, <HI>viz.</HI> that he came
back-again to <HI>Roan,</HI> and liv'd in good Reputation
there another Year; and afterwards, he was gone
to <HI>England:</HI> and that he liv'd in <HI>London:</HI> But
<HI>Amy</HI> cou'd by no means learn how to write to
him there, till by great Accident, an old <HI>Dutch</HI>
Skipper, who had formerly &s;erv'd him, coming
to <HI>Roan, Amy</HI> was told of it; and he told her,
that he lodg'd in St. <HI>Lawrence Pountncy's-Lane,</HI> in
<HI>London;</HI> but was to be &s;een every Day upon the
<HI>Exchange,</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Walk.</P>
<P>This <HI>Amy</HI> thought it was time enough to tell
me of, when &s;he came over; and be&s;ides &s;he did
not find this <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, till &s;he had &s;pent
<PB N="267" REF="272">
four or five Months, and been again at <HI>Paris,</HI>
and then come back to <HI>Roan</HI> for farther Infor|mation:
But in the mean time &s;he wrote me
from <HI>Paris,</HI> that he was not to be found by any
means; that he had been gone from <HI>Paris</HI> &s;even
or eight Years; that &s;he was told he had liv'd
at <HI>Roan,</HI> and &s;he was a-going thither to enquire,
but that &s;he had heard afterward, that he was
gone al&s;o from thence to <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;o &s;he did
not go.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, was <HI>Amy's</HI> fir&s;t Account; and I
not &s;atisfied with it, had &s;ent her an Order to
go to <HI>Roan,</HI> to enquire there al&s;o <HI>as above.</HI></P>
<P>While this was negociating, and I received
the&s;e Accounts from <HI>Amy</HI> at &s;everal times, a &s;trange
Adventure happen'd to me, which I mu&s;t men|tion
ju&s;t here; I had been Abroad to take the
Air, as u&s;ual, with my QUAKER, as far as <HI>Epping-Forre&s;t,</HI>
and we were driving back towards <HI>London;</HI>
when on the Road between <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Mile-End,</HI>
two Gentlemen on Hor&s;eback came riding-by,
having over-taken the Coach, and pa&s;s'd it, and
went forwards towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>They did not ride apace, tho' they pa&s;s'd the
Coach, for we went very &s;oftly, nor did they
look into the Coach at-all, but rode &s;ide by &s;ide,
earne&s;tly talking to one another, and linclining
their Faces &s;ide-ways a little towards one another,
he that went neare&s;t the Coach, with his Face
from it, and he that was farthe&s;t from the Coach,
with his Face towards it, and pa&s;&s;ing in the
very next Tract to the Coach, I could hear
them talk <HI>Dutch</HI> very di&s;tinctly; but it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to de&s;cribe the Confu&s;ion I was in, when
I plainly &s;aw that the farthe&s;t of the two, him
who&s;e Face look'd towards the Coach, was my
Friend, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="273">
If it had been po&s;&s;ible to conceal my Di&s;or|der
from my Friend, the QUAKER, I would have
done it, but I found &s;he was too well accquaint|ed
with &s;uch things, not to take the Hint;
do&s;t Thou under&s;tand <HI>Dutch? &s;aid &s;he; Why? &s;aid
I; Why, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> 'tis ea&s;ie to &s;uppo&s;e that Thou art
a little concern'd at &s;omewhat tho&s;e Men &s;ay;
I &s;uppo&s;e they are talking of Thee: Indeed my
good Friend, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> thou art mi&s;taken this time, for
I know very well what they are talking of, but
'tis all about Ships, and Trading Affairs: Well,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> then one of them is a Man-Friend of
Thine, or &s;omewhat is the Ca&s;e; for tho' thy
Tongue will not confe&s;s it, thy Face does.</P>
<P>I was going to have told a bold Lye, and &s;aid,
I knew nothing of them, but I found it was
impo&s;&s;ible to conceal it, &s;o <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> indeed, I think
I know the farthe&s;t of them; but I have neither
&s;poken to him, or &s;o much as &s;een him for above 11
Years: Well then, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> Thou ha&s;t &s;een him with
more than common Eyes, when thou did'&s;t &s;ee
him; or el&s;e &s;eeing him now would not be &s;uch
a Surprize to Thee: Indeed, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> 'tis true I am
a little &s;urpriz'd at &s;eeing him ju&s;t now, for I
thought he had been in quite another Part of
the World; and I can a&s;&s;ure you, I never &s;aw
him in <HI>England</HI> in my Life: Well then, 'tis the
more likely he is come over now on purpo&s;e to
&s;eek Thee: No, no, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> Knight-Errantry is over,
Women are not &s;o hard to come at, that Men
&s;hould not be able to plea&s;e them&s;elves without
running from one Kingdom to another: Well,
well, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I would have him &s;ee Thee for-all
that, as plainly as Thou ha&s;t &s;een him; No,
but he &s;han't, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> for I am &s;ure he don't
know me in this Dre&s;s, and I'll take Care he
&s;han't &s;ee my Face, if I can help it; &s;o I held up
<PB N="269" REF="274">
my Fan before my Face, and &s;he &s;aw me re&s;olute
in that, &s;o &s;he pre&s;s'd me no farther.</P>
<P>We had &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es upon the Subject,
but &s;till I let her know I was re&s;olv'd he &s;hould
not know me; but, at la&s;t, I confe&s;s'd &s;o
much, that tho' I would not let him know who
I was, or where I liv'd, I did not care if I knew
where he liv'd, and how I might enquire about
him: She took the Hint immediately, and her
Servant being behind the Coach, &s;he call'd him
to the Coach-&s;ide, and bade him keep his Eye
upon that Gentleman, and as &s;oon as the Coach
came to the End of <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> he &s;hould
get down, and follow him clo&s;ely, &s;o as to &s;ee
where he put up his Hor&s;e, and then to go
into the Inn, and enquire, if he could, who he
was, and where he liv'd.</P>
<P>The Fellow follow'd diligently to the Gate
of an Inn in <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate-Street,</HI> and &s;eeing him go
in, made no doubt but he had him fa&s;t, but
was confounded, when upon Enquiry he found
the Inn was a Thorowfare into another Street,
and that the two Gentlemen had only rode tho|row
the Inn, as the Way to the Street where they
were going, and &s;o, in &s;hort, came back no wi&s;er
than he went.</P>
<P>My kind QUAKER was more vex'd at the Di&s;|appointment,
at lea&s;t apparently &s;o, than I was;
and asking the Fellow, if he was &s;ure he knew
the Gentlemen again if he &s;aw him; the Fellow
&s;aid, he had follow'd him &s;o clo&s;e, and took &s;o
much Notice of him, in order to do his Errand
as it ought to be done, that he was very &s;ure
he &s;hould know him again; and that be&s;ides, he
was &s;ure he &s;hould know his Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>This Part was, indeed, likely enough; and the
kind QUAKER, without telling me any-thing of
<PB N="270" REF="275">
the Matter, caus'd her Man to place him&s;elf ju&s;t
at the corner of <HI>Whitechappel-Church-Wall</HI> every
<HI>Saturday</HI> in the Afternoon, that being the Day
when the Citizens chiefly ride Abroad to take the
Air; and there to watch all the Afternoon, and
look for him.</P>
<P>It was not till the fifth <HI>Saturday,</HI> that her Man
came, with a great deal of Joy, and gave her an
Account, that he had found out the Gentleman;
that he was a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> but a <HI>French</HI> Merchant;
that he came from <HI>Roan,</HI> and his Name was&mdash;;
and that he lodg'd at Mr.&mdash;on <HI>Lawrence Pount|nery's-Hill:</HI>
I was &s;urpriz'd, you may be &s;ure, when
&s;he came and told me one Evening, all the Particu|lars,
except that of having &s;et her Man to watch
I have found out thy <HI>Dutch</HI> Friend, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> and
can tell THEE how to find him too; I colour'd
again as red as Fire: Then THOU ha&s;t dealt with
the Evil One, Friend, <HI>&s;aid I very gravely:</HI> No, no,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I have no Familiar; but I tell Thee, I
have found him for Thee, and his Name is <HI>&s;o and
&s;o</HI> and he lives as above recited.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpriz'd again at this, not being able to
imagine how &s;he &s;hou'd come to know all this:
However, to put me out of Pain, &s;he told me
what &s;he had done; well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> Thou art very
kind, but this is not worth thy Pains; for now
I know it, 'tis only to &s;atisfie my Curio&s;ity, for I
&s;hall not &s;end to him upon any Account: Be that
as thou wilt, <HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI> be&s;ides, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> Thou
art in the right to &s;ay; &s;o to me; for, why &s;hou'd
I be tru&s;ted with it? tho' if I were, <HI>I a&s;&s;ure thee,</HI> I
&s;hou'd not betray thee: That is very kind, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI>
and I believe thee; and a&s;&s;ure They-&s;elf, if I do
&s;end to him, Thou &s;halt know it, and be tru&s;ted
with it too.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="276">
During this Interval of five Weeks, I &s;uffer'd a
hundred Thou&s;and Perplexities of Mind; I was
thorowly convinc'd I was right as to the Per&s;on,
that it was the Man; I knew him &s;o well, and
&s;aw him &s;o plain, I cou'd not be deceiv'd: I drove
out again in the Coach, (<HI>on Pretence of Air</HI>) al|mo&s;t
every-Day, in hopes of &s;eeing him again,
but was never &s;o lucky as to &s;ee him; and now
I had made the Di&s;covery, I was as far to &s;eek
what Mea&s;ures to take, as I was before.</P>
<P>To &s;end to him, or &s;peak to him fir&s;t, if I
&s;hou'd &s;ee him, &s;o as to be known to him, that I
re&s;olv'd not to do, if I dy'd for it; to watch
him about his Lodging, that was as much be|low
my Spirit as the other; &s;o that, <HI>in a word,</HI>
I was at a perfect Lo&s;s how to act, or what to do.</P>
<P>At length came <HI>Amy</HI>'s Letter, with the la&s;t Ac|count
which &s;he had at <HI>Roan,</HI> from the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Skipper, which confirming the other, left me out
of Doubt that this <HI>was my Man;</HI> but &s;till, no hu|mane
Invention cou'd bring me to the Speech of
him, in &s;uch a manner as wou'd &s;uit with my
Re&s;olutions; for <HI>after all,</HI> how did I know what
his Circum&s;tances were? whether marry'd or &s;in|gle?
and if he had a Wife, I know he was &s;o
hone&s;t a Man, he wou'd not &s;o much as conver&s;e
with me, or &s;o much as know me, if he met me
in the Street.</P>
<P>In the next Place, as he had entirely neglected
me, which, in &s;hort, is the wor&s;t Way of &s;light|ing
a Woman, and had given no An&s;wer to my
Letters, I did not know but he might be the &s;ame
Man &s;till; &s;o I re&s;olv'd, that I cou'd do nothing
in it, unle&s;s &s;ome fairer Opportunity pre&s;ented,
which might make my Way clearer to me; for I
was determin'd he &s;hou'd have no room to put
any more Slights upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="277">
In the&s;e Thoughts I pa&s;s'd away near three
Months; till at la&s;t, (being impatient) I re&s;olv'd
to &s;end for <HI>Amy</HI> to come Over, and tell her how
things &s;tood, and that I wou'd do nothing till &s;he
came; <HI>Amy</HI> in An&s;wer &s;ent me word, &s;he wou'd
come away with all &s;peed, but begg'd of me, that
I wou'd enter into no Engagement with him, or
any-body, till &s;he arriv'd; but &s;till keeping me in
the dark, as to the thing it&s;elf, which &s;he had to
&s;ay, at which I was heartily vex'd, for many
Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>But while all the&s;e things were tran&s;acting, and
Letters and An&s;wers pa&s;s'd between <HI>Amy</HI> and I
a little &s;lower than u&s;ual, at which I was not &s;o
well pleas'd as I us'd to be with <HI>Amy</HI>'s Di&s;patch;
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> in this time the following Scene open'd.</P>
<P>It was one Afternoon, about four a-Clock, my
Friendly QUAKER and I &s;itting in her Cham|ber
up-stairs, and very chearful, chatting together,
(<HI>for &s;he was the be&s;t Company in the World</HI>) when
&s;omebody ringing ha&s;tily at the Door, and no Ser|vant
ju&s;t then in the way, &s;he ran down <HI>her&s;elf,</HI>
to the Door; when a Gentleman appears with a
Footman attending, and making &s;ome Apologies,
which &s;he did not thorowly under&s;tand, he &s;peak|ing
but broken <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> he ask'd to &s;peak with
me, by the very &s;ame Name that I went by in her
Hou&s;e; which, <HI>by the way,</HI> was not the Name
that he had known me by.</P>
<P>She, with very civil Language, <HI>in her way,</HI> brought
him into a very hand&s;ome Parlour below-&s;tairs,
<HI>and &s;aid,</HI> &s;he wou'd go and &s;ee whether the Per&s;on
who lodg'd in her Hou&s;e own'd that Name, and
he &s;hou'd hear farther.</P>
<P>I was a little &s;urpriz'd, even before I knew any|thing
of who it was, my Mind foreboding the
thing as it happen'd; (<HI>whence that ari&s;es, let the
<PB N="273" REF="278">
Naturali&s;ts explain to us</HI>) but I was frighted, and
ready to die, when my QUAKER came up all
gay, and crowing; <HI>There,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>is the</HI> Dutch
French <HI>Merchant come to &s;ee Thee:</HI> I cou'd not &s;peak
one Word to her, nor &s;tir off of my Chaur, but
&s;at as motionle&s;s as a Statue: She talk'd a thou&s;and
plea&s;ant things to me, but they made no Impre&s;&s;ion
on me; at la&s;t &s;he pull'd me, and teiz'd me, <HI>Come,
come,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>be thy &s;elf, and rouze up,</HI> I mu&s;t go
down again to him; what &s;hall I &s;ay to him? &s;ay,
<HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that you have no &s;uch-body in the Hou&s;e:
That I cannot do, <HI>&s;ays &s;he, becau&s;e it is not the
Truth;</HI> be&s;ides, I have own'd Thou art above;
<HI>Come, come, go down with me;</HI> not for a thou&s;and
Guineas, <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> well, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I'll go and tell him
Thou wilt come quickly; &s;o, without giving me
Time to an&s;wer her, away &s;he goes.</P>
<P>A Million of Thoughts circulated in my Head
while &s;he was gone, and what to do I cou'd not
tell; I &s;aw no Remedy but I mu&s;t &s;peak with
him, but wou'd have given 500 <HI>l.</HI> to have &s;hun'd
it; yet, had I &s;hun'd it, perhaps then, I wou'd
have given 500 <HI>l.</HI> again, that I had &s;een him:
Thus fluctuating, and unconcluding, were my
Thoughts; what I &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd, I declin'd
when it offer'd it&s;elf; and what now I pretended
to decline, was nothing but what I had been at
the Expence of 40 or 50 <HI>l.</HI> to &s;end <HI>Amy</HI> to <HI>France</HI>
for; and even without any View, or indeed, any
rational Expectation of bringing it to pa&s;s; and
what, for half a Year before, I was &s;o unea&s;ie a|bout,
that I cou'd not be quiet Night or Day,
till <HI>Amy</HI> propos'd to go over to enquire after him:
In &s;hort, my Thoughts were all confus'd, and
in the utmo&s;t Di&s;order; I had once refus'd, and re|jected
him, and I repented it heartily; then I had
taken ill his Silence, and in my Mind rejected him
<PB N="274" REF="279">
again, but had repented that too: Now I had
&s;toop'd &s;o low as to &s;end after him into <HI>France,</HI>
which if he had known, perhaps, he had never
come after me; and &s;huou'd I reject him a third
time! On the other-hand, he had repented too in
his Turn, perhaps, and not knowing how I had
acted, either in &s;tooping to &s;end in Search after
him, or in the wickeder Part of my Life, was
come over hither to &s;eek me again; and I might
take him perhaps, with the &s;ame Advantages as
I might have done before, and wou'd I now be
backward to &s;ee him! Well, while I was in this
Hurry, my Friend the QUAKER, comes up again,
and perceiving the Confu&s;ion I was in, &s;he runs to
her Clo&s;et, and fetch'd me a little plea&s;ant Cor|dial,
but <HI>I wou'd not ta&s;te it: O</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I under|&s;tand
Thee, be not unea&s;ie, I'll give thee &s;omething &s;hall
take off all the Smell of it; if he ki&s;&s;es Thee a thou|&s;and
times, he &s;hall be no wi&s;er;</HI> I thought with my|&s;elf,
Thou art perfectly acquainted with Affairs of
this Nature, I think you mu&s;t govern me now, &s;o
I began to incline to go down with her; upon that,
I took the Cordial, and &s;he gave me a kind of
&s;picey Pre&s;erve after it, who&s;e Flavour was &s;o
&s;trong, and yet &s;o deliciou&s;ly plea&s;ant, that it
wou'd cheat the nice&s;t Smelling, and it left not
the lea&s;t taint of the Cordial on the Breath.</P>
<P>Well, after this, (<HI>tho' with &s;ome He&s;itation &s;till</HI>)
I went down a Pair of Back-&s;tairs with her, and
into a Dining-Room, next to the Parlour in which
he was; but there I halted, and de&s;ir'd &s;he wou'd
let me con&s;ider of it a little: <HI>Well, do &s;o,</HI> &s;ays he,
and left me with more readine&s;s than &s;he did be|fore;
<HI>do, con&s;ider, and I'll come to Thee again.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' I hung back with an awkwardne&s;s that
was really un&s;eign'd, yet when &s;he &s;o readily left
me, I thought it was not &s;o kind, and I began to
<PB N="275" REF="280">
think &s;he &s;hould have pre&s;s'd me &s;till on to it;
&s;o fooli&s;hly backward are we, to the thing, which
of all the World we mo&s;t de&s;ire; mocking our|&s;elves
with a feign'd Reluctance, when the Nega|tive
wou'd be Death to us; but &s;he was too cun|ning
for me, for while I, as it were, blam'd her in
my Mind, for not carrying me to him, tho' at the
&s;ame time I appear'd backward to &s;ee him; on a
&s;udden &s;he unlocks the Folding-Doors, which
look'd into the next Parlour, and throwing them
open, <HI>There,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, (u&s;hering him in) <HI>is the Per|&s;on
who, I &s;uppo&s;e, thou enquire&s;t for;</HI> and the &s;ame
Moment, with a kind Decency &s;he retir'd, and that
&s;o &s;wift, that &s;he wou'd not give us leave, hard|ly,
to know which Way &s;he went.</P>
<P>I &s;tood up, but was confounded with a &s;udden
Enquiry in my Thoughts, how I &s;hou'd receive
him? and with a Re&s;olution as &s;wift as Lightning,
in An&s;wer to it, <HI>&s;aid to my&s;elf,</HI> It &s;hall be COLDLY;
&s;o, on a &s;udden, I put on an Air of Stiffne&s;s and
Ceremony, and held it for about two Minutes;
but it was with great Difficulty.</P>
<P>He re&s;train'd him&s;elf too, on the other-hand,
came towards me gravely, and &s;aluted me in
Form; but it was, it &s;eems, upon his &s;uppo&s;ing
the QUAKER was behind him, whereas &s;he, <HI>as I
&s;aid,</HI> under&s;tood things too well, and had retir'd,
as if &s;he had vani&s;h'd, that we might have full
Freedom; for, <HI>as &s;he &s;aid afterwards,</HI> &s;he &s;uppos'd
we had &s;een one-another before, tho' it might have
have been a great-while ago.</P>
<P>Whatever Stiffne&s;s I had put on my Behaviour
to him, I was &s;urpriz'd in my Mind, and angry at
his, and began to wonder what kind of a ceremo|nious
Meeting it was to be: However, after he
perceiv'd the Woman was gone, he made a kind
of a He&s;itation, looking a little round him; <HI>In|deed,
<PB N="276" REF="281">
deed,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I thought the Gentlewoman was not
withdrawn,</HI> and with that, he took me in his Arms,
and ki&s;s'd me three or four times; but I that was
prejudic'd to the la&s;t Degree, with the coldne&s;s
of his fir&s;t Salutes, when I did not know the
Cau&s;e of it, cou'd not be thorowly clear'd of the
Prejudice, tho' I did know the Cau&s;e; and thought
that even his return, and taking me in his Arms,
did not &s;eem to have the &s;ame Ardour with which
he us'd to receive me, and this made me behave
to him awkwardly, <HI>and I know not how,</HI> for a good|white;
<HI>but this by the way.</HI></P>
<P>He began with a kind of an Exta&s;ie upon the
Subject of his finding me out; how it was po&s;|&s;ible
that he &s;hou'd have been four Years in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and had us'd all the Ways imaginable, and
cou'd never &s;o much as have the lea&s;t Intimation of
me, or of any-one like me; and that it was now
above two Years that he had de&s;pair'd of it, and
had given over all Enquiry; and that now he
&s;hou'd chop upon me, as it were, unlook'd and
un&s;ought-for.</P>
<P>I cou'd ea&s;ily have accounted for his not finding
me, if I had but &s;et down the Detail of my real
Retirement; but I gave it a new, and indeed, a
truly hypocritical Turn; I told him, that any-one
that knew the manner of Life I led, might ac|count
for his not finding me; that the Retreat I
had taken up, wou'd have render'd it a hundred
Thou&s;and to one odds that he ever found me at-all;
that as I had abandon'd all Conver&s;ation;
up another Name; liv'd remote from <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and had not pre&s;erv'd one Acquaintance in
it; it was no wonder he had not met with me;
that even my Dre&s;s wou'd let him &s;ee, that I did
not de&s;ire to be known by any-body.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="282">
Then he ask'd if I had not receiv'd &s;ome Let|ters
from him? I told him, No, he had not
thought fit to give me the Civility of an An&s;wer
to the la&s;t I wrote to him; and he cou'd not &s;up|po&s;e
I &s;hou'd expect a Return, after a Silence in a
Ca&s;e where I had laid my&s;elf &s;o low, and expos'd
my&s;elf in a Manner I had never been us'd to; that
indeed, I had never &s;ent for any Letters after that,
to the Place where I had order'd his to be di|rected;
and that being &s;o Ju&s;tly, as I thought, pu|ni&s;h'd
for my Weakne&s;s, I had nothing to do, but
to repent of being a Fool, after I had &s;trictly ad|her'd
to a ju&s;t Principle before: That however,
as what I did was rather from Motions of Grati|tude,
than from real Weakne&s;s, however it might
be con&s;trued by him, I had the Satisfaction in my|&s;elf
of having fully di&s;charg'd the Debt: <HI>I added,</HI>
that I had not wanted Occa&s;ions of all the &s;eeming
Advancements which the pretended Felicity of a
Marriage-Life was u&s;ually &s;et-off with, and might
have have been what I de&s;ir'd not to name; but
that, however low I had &s;toop'd to him, I had
maintain'd the Dignity of Female Liberty, again&s;t
all the Attacks, either of Pride or Avarice; and
that I had been infinitely oblig'd to him for gi|ving
me an Opportunity to di&s;charge the only Ob|ligation
that endanger'd me, without &s;ubjecting
me to the Con&s;equence; and that I hop'd he
was &s;ati&s;fied I had paid the Debt, by offering my|&s;elf
to be chain'd; but was infinitely Debtor to
him another way, for letting me remain free.</P>
<P>He was &s;o confounded at this Di&s;cour&s;e, that
he knew not what to &s;ay, and for a good-while
he &s;tood mute indeed; but recovering him&s;elf a
little, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> I run-out into a Di&s;cour&s;e he hop'd
was over, and forgotten, and he did not intend to
revive it; that he knew I had not had his Letters,
<PB N="278" REF="283">
for that, when he fir&s;t came to <HI>England,</HI> he had
been at the Place to which they were directed,
and found them all lying there, but one; and that
the People had not known how to deliver them;
that he thought to have had a Direction there,
how to find me, but had the Mortification to be
told, that they did not &s;o much as know who
I was; that he was under a great Di&s;appointment,
and that I ought to know, <HI>in An&s;wer to all my
Re&s;entments,</HI> that he had done a long, and (he
hop'd) a &s;ufficient Pennance for the Slight <HI>that
I had &s;uppos'd</HI> he had put upon me; that it was
true, (<HI>and I cou'd not &s;uppo&s;e any other</HI>) that upon
the Repul&s;e I had given him in a Ca&s;e &s;o circum|&s;tanc'd
as his was, and after &s;uch earne&s;t $word$
and &s;uch Offers as he had made me, he went
away with a Mind heartily griev'd, and full of
Re&s;entment; that he had look'd back on the
Crime he had committed, with &s;ome Regret, but
on the Cruelty of my Treatment of the poor In|fant
I went with at that time, with the utmo&s;t
Detetation; and that this made him unable to
&s;end an agreeable An&s;wer to me; for which Rea&s;on
he had &s;ent none at-all for &s;ome time; but that
in about &s;ix or &s;even Months tho&s;e Re&s;entments
wearing off by the return of his Affection to me,
and his Concern in the poor Child&mdash;<HI>there he
&s;topp'd, and indeed, Tears &s;tood in his Eyes, while in
$word$ Parenthe&s;is</HI> he only added, <HI>and to this Minute he
did not know whether it was dead or alive;</HI> he then
went on, tho&s;e Re&s;entments wearing off, he &s;ent
me &s;everal Letters, <HI>I think he &s;aid,</HI> &s;even or eight,
but receiv'd no An&s;wer; that then his Bu&s;ine&s;s
obliging him to go to <HI>Holland,</HI> he came to <HI>England,</HI>
as in his Way, but found, <HI>as above,</HI> that his Letters
had not been call'd for, but that he left them at
the Hou&s;e after paying the Po&s;tage of them; and
<PB N="279" REF="284">
going then back to <HI>France,</HI> he was yet unea&s;ie,
and cou'd not refrain the <HI>Knight-Errantry</HI> of co|ming
to <HI>England</HI> again to &s;eek me, tho' he knew
neither where, or of who, to enquire for me, be|ing
di&s;appointed in all his Enquiries before: That
he had yet taken up his Re&s;idence here, firmly
believing, that one-time or other he &s;hou'd meet
me, or hear of me, and that &s;ome kind Chance
wou$ d at la&s;t throw him in my Way; that he
had liv'd thus above four Years, and tho' his
Hopes were vani&s;h'd, yet he had not any Thoughts
of removing any more in the World, unle&s;s it
&s;hou'd be at la&s;t, as it is with other old Men, he
might have &s;ome Inclination to go Home, to die
in his own Country; but that he had not thought
of it yet; that if I wou'd con&s;ider all the&s;e Steps,
I wou'd find &s;ome Rea&s;ons to forget his fir&s;t Re|$entments,
and to think that Pennance, <HI>as he call'd
it,</HI> which he had undergone in &s;earch of me, an
<HI>Amende Honorable,</HI> in Reparation of the Affront
given to the Kindne&s;s of my Letter of Invitation;
and that we might at la&s;t make our&s;elves &s;ome
Satisfaction on both &s;ides, for the Mortifications
pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I cou'd not hear all this withot be|ing
mov'd very much, and yet I continued a little
&s;tiff and formal too, a good-while: <HI>I told him,</HI>
that before I cou'd give him any Reply to the
re&s;t of his Di&s;cour&s;e, I ought to give him the
Satisfaction of telling him, <HI>that his Son was alive;</HI>
and that indeed, &s;ince I &s;aw him &s;o concern'd a|bout
it, and mention it with &s;uch Affection, I was
&s;orry that I had not found out &s;ome Way or other
to let him know it &s;ooner; but that I thought,
after his &s;lighting the Mother, <HI>as above,</HI> he had
&s;umm'd up his Affection to the Child, in the Let|ter
he had wrote to me about providing for it;
<PB N="280" REF="285">
and that he had, as other Fathers often do, look'd
upon it as a Birth, <HI>which being out of the Way,</HI> was to
be forgotten, as its Beginning was to be repented
of; that in providing &s;ufficiently for it, he had
done more than all &s;uch Fathers us'd to do, and
might be well &s;atisfied with it.</P>
<P>He an&s;wer'd me, that he &s;hou'd have been very
glad if I had been &s;o good, but to have given him
the Sati&s;faction of knowing the poor unfortunate
Creature was yet alive, and he wou'd have taken
&s;ome Care of it upon him&s;elf, and particularly, by
owning it for a legitimate Child, which, where no|body
had known to the contrary, wou'd have taken
off the Infamy which wou'd otherwi&s;e cleave to it;
and &s;o the Child &s;hou'd not, <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> have known
any-thing of its own Di&s;a&s;ter; but that he fear'd it
was now too late.</P>
<P><HI>He added,</HI> that I might &s;ee by all his Conduct
&s;ince that, what unhappy Mi&s;take drew him into
the thing at fir&s;t; and that he wou'd have been
very far from doing the Injury to me, or being
in&s;trumental to add <HI>vne Mi&s;erable,</HI> (that was his
Word) to the World, if he had not been drawn
into it, by the Hopes he had of making me his
own; but that, if it was po&s;&s;ible to re&s;cue the Child
from the Con&s;equences of its unhappy Birth, he
hop'd I wou'd give him leave to do it, and he
wou'd let me &s;ee that he had both Means and
Affection &s;till to do it; and that, notwith&s;tanding
all the Mi&s;fortunes that had befallen him, nothing
that belong'd to him, e&s;pecially by a Mother he
had &s;uch a Concern for, as he had for me, &s;hou'd
ever want what he was in a Condition to do for it.</P>
<P>I cou'd not hear this without being &s;en&s;ibly
touch'd with it; I was a&s;ham'd that he &s;hou'd
&s;how that he had more real Affection for the Child,
tho' he had never &s;een it in his Life, than I that
<PB N="281" REF="286">
bore it; for indeed, I did not love the Child,
nor love to &s;ee it; and tho' I had provided for it,
yet I did it by <HI>Amy</HI>'s Hand, and had not &s;een it
above twice in four Years; being privately re&s;olv'd
that when it grew up, it &s;hou'd not be able to call
me Mother.</P>
<P>However, <HI>I told him,</HI> the Child was taken Care
of, and that he need not be anxious about it, un|le&s;s
he &s;u&s;pected, that I had le&s;s Affection for
it than he, that had never &s;een it in his Life; that
he knew what I had promis'd him to do for it,
<HI>namely,</HI> to give it the Thou&s;and Pi&s;toles which I
had offer'd him, and which he had declined; <HI>that,
I a&s;&s;ur'd him,</HI> I had made my Will, and that I had
left it 5000<HI>l.</HI> and the Intere&s;t of it till he &s;hou'd
come of Age, if I died before that time; that I
wou'd &s;till be as good as that to it; but if he
had a-mind to take it from me, into his Govern|ment,
I wou'd not be again&s;t it; and to &s;ati&s;fie
him that I wou'd perform what I &s;aid, I wou'd
cau&s;e the Child to be deliver'd to him, and the
5000<HI>l.</HI> al&s;o for its Support; depending upon it,
that he wou'd &s;how him&s;elf a Father to it by
what I &s;aw of his Affection to it, now.</P>
<P>I had ob&s;erv'd that he had hinted two or three
times in his Di&s;cour&s;e, his having had <HI>Misfortunes
in the World</HI> and I was a little &s;urpriz'd at the
Expre&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially at the repeating it &s;o often,
but I took no Notice of that Part yet.</P>
<P>He thank'd me for my Kindne&s;s to the Child,
with a Tenderne&s;s which &s;hew'd the Sincerity of
all he had &s;aid before; and which encrceas'd the
Regret with which, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> I look'd back on
the little Affection I had &s;hew'd to the poor Child;
<HI>he told me,</HI> he did not de&s;ire to take him from me,
but &s;o as to introduce him into the World as his
own; which he cou'd &s;till do, having liv'd ab&s;ent
<PB N="282" REF="287">
from his other Children (for he had two Sons
and a Daughter which were brought up at <HI>Nimeu|gen</HI>
in <HI>Holland,</HI> with a Si&s;ter of his) &s;o long, that
he might very well &s;end another Son of ten Years
old to be bred up with them; and &s;uppo&s;e his
Mother to be dead or alive, as he found Occa|&s;ion;
and that as I had re&s;olv'd to do &s;o hand|&s;omely
for the Child, he wou'd add to it &s;ome|thing
con&s;iderable, tho' having had &s;ome great
Di&s;appointments, (<HI>repeating the Words</HI>) he cou'd
not do for it as he wou'd otherwi&s;e have done.</P>
<P>I then thought my&s;elf oblig'd to take Notice of
his having &s;o often mention'd his having <HI>met with
Di&s;appointments;</HI> I told him, I was very &s;orry to
hear he had met with any-thing afflicting to him
in the World; that I wou'd not have any-thing
belonging to me, add to his Lo&s;s, or weaken him
in what he might do for his other Children;
and that I wou'd not agree to his having the
Child away, <HI>tho' the Propo&s;al was infinitely to the
Child's Advantage,</HI> unle&s;s he wou'd promi&s;e me,
that the whole Expence &s;hou'd be mine; and that
i&s; he did not think 5000 <HI>l.</HI> enough for the Child,
I wou'd give it more.</P>
<P>We had &s;o much Di&s;cour&s;e upon this, <HI>and the old
Affairs,</HI> that it took up all our Time at his fir&s;t
Vi&s;it; I was a little importunate with him, to tell
me how he came to find me out, but he put it
off for that time; and only obtaining my Leave
to vi&s;it me again, he went away; and indeed, my
Heart was &s;o full with what he had &s;aid already,
that I was glad when he went away; &s;ometimes
I was full of Tenderne&s;s and Affection for him,
and e&s;pecially, when he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf &s;o ear|ne&s;tly
and pa&s;&s;ionately about the Child; other|times
I was crowded with Doubts about his Cir|cum&s;tances;
&s;ometimes I was terrify'd with Ap|prehen&s;ions,
<PB N="283" REF="288">
let if I &s;hou'd come into a clo&s;e Cor|re&s;pondence
with him, he &s;hou'd any-way come
to hear what kind of Life I had led at <HI>Pall-Mall,</HI>
and in other Places, and it might make me mi&s;e|rable
a&s;terwards; from which la&s;t Thought I con|concluded,
that I had better repul&s;e him again,
than receive him: All the&s;e Thoughts, and many
more, crowded in &s;o fa&s;t, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> upon me, that I
wanted to give Vent to them, and get rid of him,

<P>We had &s;everal Meetings after this, in which
&s;till we had &s;o many Preliminaries to go through,
that we &s;carce ever border'd upon the main Sub|ject;

put it off with a kind of a Je&s;t; alas! <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> tho&s;e

two Ages &s;ince tho&s;e things were talk'd between
us, <HI>&s;ays I;</HI> you &s;ee I am grown <HI>an Old-Woman</HI>
&s;ince that: Another time he gave a little Pu&s;h at
it again, and I laugh'd again; <HI>Why what do&s;t thou
talk of,</HI> &s;aid I, in a formal way, <HI>Do&s;t thou not &s;ee I
am turn'd</HI> QUAKER? <HI>I cannot &s;peak of tho&s;e things

as other People, and love one-another as well; be|&s;ides,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the QUAKERS Dre&s;s does-not ill-become

went off for a third time; <HI>however,</HI> I began to be kind-to
him in proce&s;s of time, <HI>as they call it,</HI> and we
grew very intimate; and if the following Accident

with &s;ome great Lo&s;&s;es and Misfortunes;
that he had been in <HI>Holland</HI> on that very

from a <HI>Dutch</HI> Skipper, that he was at <HI>London,</HI>

was to be found upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> on the

Pountney's-Lane,</HI> and the like; &s;o <HI>Amy</HI>

worth looking-after: This &s;he did becau&s;e
of the next Clau&s;e, which the Jade had mo&s;t
mind-to, on many Accounts.</ITEM>

me, in a Figure &s;uitable to my Quality.</ITEM>

<P><HI>Amy,</HI> an ambitious Jade, who knew my weake&s;t

I lov'd to be flatter'd and courted; &s;aid abun|dance

been able to come at a Certainty what was
become of him, or in what Part of the
World he was; but that thus much &s;he had
learn'd from good-hands, that he had com|mitted
a Crime, in being concern'd in a De|&s;ign
to rob a rich Banker at <HI>Paris;</HI> and that
he was fled, and had not been heard-of there
for above &s;ix Years.</ITEM>

<P>This Account of the Prince, and the return of
his Affection to me, with all the flattering great
things which &s;eem'd to come along with it; and
e&s;pecially, as they came gilded, and &s;et-out by my
Maid <HI>Amy; I &s;ay,</HI> this Account of the Prince
came to me in a very unlucky Hour, and in the
very Cri&s;is of my Affair.</P>
<P>The Merchant and I had enter'd into clo&s;e Con|ferences
upon the grand Affair; I had left off
talking my Platonicks, and of my Independency,
and being a <HI>Free Woman, as before;</HI> and he having
clear'd up my Doubts too, as to his Circum&s;tances,
and the Mi&s;fortunes he had &s;poken of, I had gone
&s;o far, that we had begun to con&s;ider where we
&s;hou'd live, and in what Figure; what Equipage;
what Hou&s;e, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>I had made &s;ome Harangues upon the delight|full
Retirement of a Country-Life, and how we
might enjoy our&s;elves &s;o effectually, without the
Incumbrances of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the World; but
all this was <HI>Grimace,</HI> and purely becau&s;e I was afraid
to make any publick Appearance in the World,
for fear &s;ome impertinent Per&s;on of Quality &s;hou'd
chop upon again, and cry out, <HI>Roxana, Roxana,</HI>
by&mdash;, with an Oath, <HI>as had been done before.</HI></P>
<P>My Merchant, bred to Bu&s;ine&s;s, and us'd to
conver&s;e among Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, cou'd hardly
tell how to live without it; at lea&s;t, it appear'd
he &s;hou'd be like a Fi&s;h out of Water, unea&s;ie and
dying; but however, he join'd with me, only-ar|gued,
that we might live as near <HI>London</HI> as we
cou'd; that he might &s;ometimes come to <HI>Change,</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="292">
and hear how the World &s;hou'd go Abroad, and
how it far'd with his Friends, and his Children.</P>
<P><HI>I an&s;wer'd,</HI> That if he cho&s;e &s;till to embarra&s;s
him&s;elf with Bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;uppos'd it wou'd be more
to his Sati&s;faction to be in his own Country, and
where his Family was &s;o well known, and where
his Children al&s;o were.</P>
<P>He &s;mil'd at the Thoughts of that, <HI>and let me
know,</HI> that he &s;hou'd be very willing to embrace
&s;uch an Offer, but that he cou'd not expect it of
me, to whom <HI>England</HI> was, <HI>to be &s;ure,</HI> &s;o natu|raliz'd
now, as that it wou'd be carrying me out
of my native Country, which he wou'd not de|&s;ire
by any means, however agreeable it might be
to him.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> he was mi&s;take in me; that as I
had told him &s;o much of a Married State being a
Captivity, and the Family being a Hou&s;e of Bon|dage;
that when I married, I expected to be but
an Upper Servant; &s;o if I did, notwith&s;tanding,
&s;ubmit to it, I hop'd he &s;hou'd &s;ee I knew how
to act the Servant's Part, and do every-thing to
oblige my Ma&s;ter; that if I did not re&s;olve to
go with him wherever he de&s;ir'd to go, he might
depend I wou'd never have him; <HI>and did I not,</HI>
&s;aid I, <HI>offer my&s;elf to go with you to the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies?</P>
<P>All this while, this was indeed, but a Copy of
my Countenance; for as my Circum&s;tances wou'd
not admit my Stay in <HI>London,</HI> at lea&s;t, not &s;o as
to appear publickly; I re&s;olv'd if I took him, to
live remote in the Country, or go out of <HI>England</HI>
with him.</P>
<P>But in <HI>an evil Hour,</HI> ju&s;t now came <HI>Amy</HI>'s Le|tter;
in the very middle of all the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es;
and the fine things &s;he had &s;aid about <HI>the Prince,</HI>
began to make &s;trange Work with me; the Notion
of being <HI>a Prince&s;s,</HI> and going over to live where
<PB N="288" REF="293">
all that had happen'd here, wou'd have been quite
&s;unk out of Knowledge, as well as out of Memo|ry,
(<HI>Con&s;cience excepted</HI>) was mighty taking; the
Thoughts of being &s;urrounded with Dome&s;ticks;
honour'd with Titles; be call'd HER HIGHNESS;
and live in all the Splendor of a Court; and, <HI>which
was &s;till more,</HI> in the Arms of a Man of &s;uch Rank,
and who I knew lov'd and valued me; all this,
<HI>in a word,</HI> dazzl'd my Eyes; turn'd my Head;
and I was as truly craz'd and di&s;tracted for about
a Fortnight, as mo&s;t of the People in <HI>Bedlam,</HI>
tho' perhaps, not quite &s;o far gone.</P>
<P>When my Gentleman came to me the next time,
I had no Notion of him; I wi&s;h'd I had never re|ceiv'd
him at-all; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I re&s;olv'd to have no
more to &s;ay to him; &s;o I &s;eign'd my&s;elf indi&s;pos'd;
and tho' I did come down to him, and &s;peak to
him a little, yet I let him &s;ee that I was &s;o ill,
that I was <HI>(as we &s;ay)</HI> no Company, and that it
wou'd be kind in him to give me Leave to quit
him for that time.</P>
<P>The next Morning he &s;ent a Footman to enquire
how I did; and I let him know, I had a violent
Cold, and was very ill with it; two Days after,
he came again, and I let him &s;ee me again, but
feign'd my&s;elf &s;o hoar&s;e, that I cou'd not &s;peak
to be heard; and that it was painful to me but
to whi&s;per; and, <HI>in a word,</HI> I held him in this &s;u&s;|pence
near three Weeks.</P>
<P>During this time, I had a &s;trange Elevation up|on
my Mind; and the Prince, <HI>or the Spirit of him,</HI>
had &s;uch a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, that I &s;pent mo&s;t of
this Time in the reallizing all the Great Things
of <HI>a Life with the Prince,</HI> to my Mind; plea&s;ing
my Fancy with the Grandeur I was &s;uppo&s;ing my|&s;elf
to enjoy; and withal, wickedly &s;tudying in
what Manner to put off this Gentleman, and be|$id
of him $word$.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="294">
I cannot but &s;ay, that &s;ometimes the Ba&s;ene&s;s of
the Action &s;tuck hard with me; the Honour and
Sincerity with which he had always treated me;
and, <HI>above all,</HI> the Fidelity he had &s;hew'd me at
<HI>Paris,</HI> and that I ow'd my Life to him; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> all
the&s;e &s;tar'd in my Face; and I frequently argued
with my&s;elf upon the Obligation I was under,
to him; and how ba&s;e wou'd it be, <HI>now too, after
&s;o many Obligations and Engagements,</HI> to ca&s;t him off?</P>
<P>But the Title of <HI>Highne&s;s</HI> and of <HI>a Prince&s;s,</HI>
and all tho&s;e fine things, as they came in, weigh'd
down all this; <HI>and the Scene of Gratitude vani&s;h'd,
as if it had been a Shadow.</HI></P>
<P>At other times, I con&s;ider'd the Wealth I was
Mi&s;tre&s;s of; that I was able to live like a Prince&s;s,
tho' not a Prince&s;s; and that my Merchant (<HI>for he
had told me all the Affair of his Mi&s;fortunes</HI>) was far
from being poor, or even mean; that together,
we were able to make up an E&s;tate of between
three and four Thou&s;and Pounds a Year, which
was in it&s;elf, equal to &s;ome Princes abroad: But
tho' this was true, yet the Name of <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> and
the flutter of it, <HI>in a word,</HI> the Pride weigh'd 'em
down; and all the&s;e Arguings generally ended to
the Di&s;advantage of my Merchant; &s;o that, <HI>in
&s;hort,</HI> I re&s;olv'd to drop him, and give him a final
An&s;wer, at his next coming; <HI>namely,</HI> That &s;ome|thing
had happen'd in my Affairs, which had
caus'd me to alter my Mea&s;ures, unexpectedly;
and, <HI>in a word,</HI> to de&s;ire him to trouble him&s;elf
no farther.</P>
<P>I think verily, this rude Treatment of him, was
for &s;ome time, the Effect of a violent Fermentation
in my Blood; for the very Motion which the &s;teddy
Contemplation of my fancy'd Greatne&s;s had put
my Spirits into, had thrown me into a kind of
Fever, and I &s;carce knew what I did.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="295">
I have wonder'd &s;ince, that it did not make me
Mad; nor do I now think it &s;trange, to hear of
tho&s;e, who have been quite <HI>Lunatick</HI> with their
Pride; that fancy'd them&s;elves Queens, and Em|pre&s;&s;es,
and have made their Attendants &s;erve them
upon the Knee; given Vi&s;itors their Hand to
ki&s;s, <HI>and the like;</HI> for certainly, if Pride will not
turn the Brain, nothing can.</P>
<P>However, the next time my Gentleman came,
I had not Courage enough, <HI>or not Ill-Nature enough,</HI>
to treat him in the rude Manner I had re&s;olv'd
to do; and it was very well I did not; for &s;oon
after, I had another Letter from <HI>Amy,</HI> in which
was the mortifying News, and indeed, &s;urprizing
to me, that my Prince (<HI>as I with a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure
had call'd him</HI>) was very much hurt by a Brui&s;e he
had receiv'd in hunting (and engaging with) a
wild Boar; a cruel and de&s;perate Sport, which the
Noblemen of <HI>Germany,</HI> it &s;eems, much delight in.</P>
<P>This alarm'd me indeed, and the more, becau&s;e
<HI>Amy</HI> wrote me word, that his Gentleman was gone
away Expre&s;s to him, not without Apprehen&s;ions,
that he &s;hou'd find his Ma&s;ter was dead, before
his coming home; but that he [<HI>the Gentleman</HI>]
had promis'd her, that as &s;oon as he arriv'd, he
wou'd &s;end back the &s;ame Courier to her, with
an Account of his Ma&s;ter's Health, and of the
main Affair; and that he had oblig'd <HI>Amy</HI> to &s;tay
at <HI>Paris</HI> fourteen Days for his Return; &s;he having
promis'd him before, to make it her Bu&s;ine&s;s to go
to <HI>England,</HI> and to find me out for his Lord, if he
&s;ent her &s;uch Orders; and he was to &s;end her a
Bill for fifty Pi&s;toles, for her Journey: So <HI>Amy</HI>
told me &s;he waited for the An&s;wer.</P>
<P>This was a Blow to me &s;everal Ways; for <HI>fir&s;t,</HI>
I was in a State of Uncertainty as to his Per&s;on,
whether he was alive or dead; and I was not un|concern'd
<PB N="291" REF="296">
in that Part, I a&s;&s;ure you; for I had an
inexpre&s;&s;ible Affection remainiing for his Per&s;on,
be&s;ides the Degree to which it was reviv'd by the
View of a firmer Intere&s;t in him; <HI>but this was not
all;</HI> for in lo&s;ing him, I for-ever lo&s;t the Pro&s;pect

Letter, I was like &s;till, to remain another Fort|night;
and had I now continued the Re&s;olution of
u&s;ing my Merchant in the rude Manner I once in|tended,
I had made, perhaps, a &s;orry Piece of Work
of it indeed, and it was very well my Heart fail'd
me, <HI>as it did.</HI></P>
<P>However, I treated him with a great-many
Shuffles, and &s;eign'd Stories, to keep him off from
any clo&s;er Conferences than we had already had,
that I might act afterwards as Occa&s;ion might
offer, one way or other: But that which morti|fied
me mo&s;t, was, that <HI>Amy</HI> did not write, tho'
the fourteen Days was expir'd; at la&s;t, to my
great Surprize, when I was, with the utmo&s;t Impa|tience,
looking out at the Window, expecting the
Po&s;tman, that u&s;ually brought the Foreign Let|ters;
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I was agreeably &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee a
Coach come to the Yard-Gate where we liv'd,
and my Woman, <HI>Amy,</HI> alight out of it, and come
towards the Door, having the Coachman bring|ing
&s;everal Bundles after her:</P>
<P>I flew like Lightning down-&s;tairs, to &s;peak to
her; but was &s;oon damp'd with her News: Is
the Prince alive or dead, <HI>Amy? &s;ays I:</HI> She &s;poke
coldly, and &s;lightly: <HI>He is alive, Madam,</HI> &s;aid &s;he,
<HI>but it is not much Matter, I had as-lieu he had been
dead;</HI> &s;o we went up-&s;tairs again to my Chamber,
and there we began a &s;erious Di&s;cour&s;e of the
whole Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="297">
Fir&s;t, <HI>&s;he told me a long Story</HI> of his being hurt
by a Wild-Boar; and of the Condition he was
reduc'd to, &s;o that every-one expected he &s;hou'd
die, the Angui&s;h of the Wound having thrown
him into a Fever; with abundance of Circum|&s;tances,
too long to relate here; how he recover'd
of that extreme Danger, but continued very weak;
how the Gentleman had been <HI>Homme de Parole,</HI>
and had &s;ent back the Courier, as punctually, as
if it had been to the KING; that he had given
a long Account of his Lord, and of his Illne&s;s,
and Recovery; but the &s;um of the Matter, <HI>as to
me,</HI> was, That as to the Lady, his Lord was turn'd
Penitent; was under &s;ome Vows for his Recovery,
and cou'd not think any-more on that Affair; and
e&s;pecially, the Lady being gone, and that it had
not been offer'd to her, &s;o there was no Breach of
Honour; but that his Lord was &s;en&s;ible of the
good Offices of Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> and had &s;ent her the
fifty Pi&s;toles for her Trouble, as if &s;he had really
gone the Journey.</P>
<P>I was, <HI>I confe&s;s,</HI> hardly able to bear the fir&s;t Sur|prize
of this Di&s;appointment; <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;aw it, and gapes
out, (<HI>as was her way) Law'd Madam!</HI> never be con|cern'd
at it; you &s;ee he is gotten among the Prie&s;ts;
and I &s;uppo&s;e, they have &s;aucily impos'd &s;ome
Pennance upon him; and, <HI>it may-be,</HI> &s;ent him of
an Errand barefoot, to &s;ome <HI>Madonna</HI> or <HI>No&s;ter|dame</HI>
or other; and he is off of his Amours for the
pre&s;ent; I'll warrant you, he'll be as wicked a|gain
as ever he was, when he is got throrow-well,
and gets but out of their Hands again: I hate
this out-o'-Sea&s;on Repentance; what Occa&s;ion
had he in his Repentance, to be off of taking
a good Wife? I &s;hou'd have been glad to &s;ee you
have been a Prince&s;s, <HI>and all that;</HI> but if it can't
be, never afflict your&s;elf; you are rich enough to
<PB N="293" REF="298">
be a Prince&s;s to your&s;elf; you don't want him,
that's the be&s;t of it:</P>
<P>Well, I cry'd for-all that, and was heartily
vex'd and that a great-while; but as <HI>Amy</HI> was
always at my Elbow, and always jogging it out of
my Head, with her Mirth, and her Wit, it wore
off again.</P>
<P>Then I told <HI>Amy</HI> all the Story of my Merchant,
and how he had found me out, when I was in
&s;uch a Concern to find him; how it was true,
that he lodg'd in St. <HI>Lawrence Pountney's-Lane;</HI>
and how I had had all the Story of his Misfor|tune,
which &s;he had heard of, in which he had
lo&s;t above 8000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; and that he had
told me frankly of it, before &s;he had &s;ent me any
Account of it, or, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> before I had taken any
Notice that I had heard of it.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was very joyful at that Part; Well, Ma|dam
then, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> what need you value the
Story of the Prince? and going I know not whe|ther
into <HI>Germany,</HI> to lay your Bones in another
World, and learn the Dev'il's Language, call'd
HIGH-DUTCH? You are better here, by-half, <HI>&s;ays
Amy:</HI> Law'd Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> why are not you
as rich as <HI>Cra&s;&s;us?</HI></P>
<P>Well, it was a great-while &s;till, before I cou'd
bring my&s;elf off of this fancy'd Sovereignty; and
I that was &s;o willing once to be Mi&s;tre&s;s to a KING,
was now ten thou&s;and times more fond of being
Wife to a Prince.</P>
<P>So fa&s;t a hold has Pride and Ambition upon our
Minds, that when once it gets Admi&s;&s;ion, no|thing
is &s;o chimerical, but under this Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
we can form <HI>Ideas</HI> of, in our Fancy, and realize
to our Imagination: Nothing can be &s;o ridicu|lous
as the &s;imple Steps we take in &s;uch Ca&s;es; a
Man or a Woman becomes a meer <HI>Malade Imagi|naire,</HI>
<PB N="294" REF="299">
and I believe, may as ea&s;ily die with Grief,
or run-mad with Joy, (as the Affair in his Fancy
appears right or wrong) as if all was real, and actu|ally
under the Management of the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I had indeed, two A&s;&s;i&s;tants to deliver me from
this Snare, and the&s;e were, <HI>fir&s;t, Amy,</HI> who knew my
Di&s;ea&s;e, but was able do nothing as to the Reme|dy;
the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> the Merchant, who really brought
the Remedy, but knew nothing of the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>I remember, when all the&s;e Di&s;orders were up|on
my Thoughts, in one of the Vi&s;its my Friend
the Merchant made me, he took Notice, that he
perceiv'd I was under &s;ome unu&s;ual Di&s;order;
he believ'd, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that my Di&s;temper, <HI>what|ever
it was,</HI> lay much in my Head, and it being
Summer-Weather, and very hot, propos'd to me
to go a little-way into the Air.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted at his Expre&s;&s;ion; what <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> do you
think then, that <HI>I am $raz'd?</HI> you &s;hou'd then
propo&s;e a Mad-Hou&s;e for my Cure: No, no, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
I do not mean any-thing like that, I hope the
Head may be di&s;temper'd, and not the Brain:
Well, I was too &s;en&s;ible that he was right, for I
knew I had acted a &s;trange wild kind of Part with
him; but he in&s;i&s;ted upon it, and pre&s;s'd me to
go into the Country: <HI>I took him &s;hort again,</HI> What
need you, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> &s;end me out of your Way? It is
in your Power to be le&s;s troubled with me, and
with le&s;s Inconvenience to us both.</P>
<P>He took that ill, and told me I us'd to have a
better Opinion of his Sincerity; and de&s;ir'd to
know what he had done to forfeit my Charity: I
mention this, only to let you &s;ee how far I had
gone in my Mea&s;ures of quitting him, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI>
how near I was of &s;hewing him how ba&s;e, ungrate|ful,
and how vilely I cou'd act: But I found I had
carried the Je&s;t far enough, and that a little Mat|ter;
<PB N="295" REF="300">
might have made him &s;ick of me again, as he
was before; for I began, by little and little, to change
my way of talking to him, and to come to Di&s;cour&s;e
to the Purpo&s;e again, as we had done before.</P>
<P>A while after this, when we were very merry,
and talking familiarly together, he call'd me with
an Air of particular Satisfaction, <HI>his Prince&s;s;</HI> I
colour'd at the Word, <HI>for it indeed touch'd me
to the quick;</HI> but he knew nothing of the Rea&s;on of
my being touch'd with it: What d'ye mean by
that, <HI>&s;aid I?</HI> Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I mean nothing, but
that you are a Prince&s;s to me: Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> as to
that, I am content; and yet I cou'd tell you, I
might have been a Prince&s;s if I wou'd have quit|ted
you, and believe I cou'd be &s;o &s;till: It is not
in my Power to make you a Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but
I can ea&s;ily make you a Lady, here in <HI>England,</HI>
and a Counte&s;s too, if you will go out of it.</P>
<P>I heard both with a great-deal of Satisfaction,
for my Pride remain'd, tho' it had been baulk'd,
and I thought <HI>with my&s;elf,</HI> that this Propo&s;al wou'd
make me &s;ome Amends for the Lo&s;s of the Title
that had &s;o tickl'd my Imagination another-way;
and I was impatient to under&s;tand what he meant;
but I wou'd not ask him by any-means; &s;o it
pa&s;s'd off for that time.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I told <HI>Amy</HI> what he had
&s;aid, and <HI>Amy</HI> was as impatient to know the Man|ner,
how it cou'd be, as I was; but the next
time, (<HI>perfectly unexpected to me</HI>) he told me, that
he had accidentally mention'd a thing to me, la&s;t
time he was with me, having not the lea&s;t Thought
of the thing it&s;elf; but not knowing but &s;uch a
thing might be of &s;ome Weight to me, and that
it might bring me Re&s;pect among People where I
might appear, he had thought &s;ince of it, and
was re&s;olv'd to ask me about it.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="301">
I made light of it, and told him, that as he
knew I had cho&s;en a retir'd Life, it was of no
Value to me to be call'd LADY, or COUNTESS
either; but that if he intended to drag me, <HI>as I
might call it,</HI> into the World again, perhaps it
might be agreeable to him; but, <HI>be&s;ides that,</HI> I
cou'd not judge of the thing, becau&s;e I did not
understand how either of them was to be done.</P>
<P>He told me, that Money purchas'd Titles of
Honour in almo&s;t all Parts of the World; tho'
Money cou'd not give Principles of Honour,
they mu&s;t come by Birth and Blood; that how|ever,
Titles &s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;t to elevate the Soul,
and to infu&s;e generous Principles into the Mind,
and e&s;pecially, where there was a good Foundation
laid in the Per&s;ons; that he hop'd we &s;hou'd nei|ther
of us misbehave, if we came to it; and that
as we knew how to wear a Title without undue
Elevations, &s;o it might &s;it as well upon us, as on
Another; that as to <HI>England,</HI> he had nothing to
do, but to get an Act of <HI>Naturalization</HI> in his Fa|vour,
and he knew where to purcha&s;e a Patent
for BARONET, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> to have the Ho|nour
and Title tran&s;ferr'd to him; but if I in|tended
to go Abroad with him, he had a Nephew,
the Son of his Elder Brother, who had the Title
of COUNT, with the E&s;tate annex'd, which was
but &s;mall; and that he had frequently offer'd to
make it over to him for a thou&s;and Pi&s;toles,
which was not a great-deal of Money; and con&s;i|dering
it was in the Family already, he wou'd,
upon my being willing, purcha&s;e it immediately.</P>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> I lik'd the la&s;t be&s;t; but then, I
wou'd not let him buy it, unle&s;s he wou'd let me
pay the thou&s;and Pi&s;toles: No, No, <HI>&s;ay he,</HI> I
refus'd a thou&s;and Pi&s;toles that I had more Right
to have accepted, than that, and you &s;hall not be
<PB N="297" REF="302">
at &s;o much Expence now: Yes, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you did
refu&s;e it, and perhaps, repented it afterwards: I
never complain'd, <HI>&s;ays he;</HI> but I did <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and often
repented it for you: I do not under&s;tand you, <HI>.&s;ays
he:</HI> Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I repented that I &s;uffer'd you to
refu&s;e it; Well, well, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we may talk of that
hereafter, when you &s;hall re&s;olve which Part of the
World you will make your &s;ettl'd Re&s;idence in:
Here he talk'd very hand&s;omely to me, and for
a good-while together; how it had been his Lot
to live all his Days out of his Native Country,
and to be often &s;hifting and changing the Situa|tion
of his Affairs; and that I my&s;elf had not al|ways
had a fix'd Abode; but that now, as neither
of us was very Young, he fancy'd I wou'd be for
taking-up our Abode, where, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> we might
remove no more; that as to his Part, he was
of that Opinion entirely, only with this Ex|ception,
that the Choice of the Place &s;hou'd be
mine; for, that all Places in the World were alike
to him; only with this &s;ingle Addition, <HI>namely,</HI>
that I was with him.</P>
<P>I heard him with a great-deal of Plea&s;ure, <HI>as well</HI>
for his being willing to give me the Choice, as
for that re&s;olv'd to live Abroad, for the Rea&s;on
I have mention'd already, <HI>namely,</HI> le&s;t I &s;hou'd at
any-time be known in <HI>England,</HI> and all that Story
of <HI>Roxana,</HI> and the Balls, &s;hou'd come out; as al&s;o
I was not a little tickl'd with the Satisfaction of
being &s;till <HI>a Counte&s;s,</HI> tho' I cou'd not be <HI>a Prince&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I told <HI>Amy</HI> all this Story, for &s;he was &s;till my
Privy-Coun&s;ellor; but when I ask'd her Opinion,
&s;he made me laugh heartily: <HI>Now, which of the
two &s;hall I take,</HI> Amy? <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> &s;hall I be a Lady,
<HI>that is,</HI> a Baronet's Lady in <HI>England,</HI> or a Counte&s;s
in <HI>Holland?</HI> the ready-witted Jade, that knew the
Pride of my Temper too, almo&s;t as well as did,
<PB N="298" REF="303">
my&s;elf, an&s;wer'd, (without the lea&s;t He&s;itation)
<HI>both, Madam;</HI> which of them! <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> (repeating
the Words) why not both of them? and then
you will be really <HI>a Prince&s;s;</HI> for &s;ure, to be a
Lady in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and a Counte&s;s in <HI>Dutch,</HI> may
make a Prince&s;s in <HI>High-Dutch:</HI> Upon the whole,
tho' <HI>Amy</HI> was in je&s;t, he put the Thought into
my Head, and I re&s;olv'd, that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I wou'd
be both of them; which I manag'd as you &s;hall
hear.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;eem'd to re&s;olve that I wou'd live and
&s;ettle in <HI>England,</HI> only with this Condition, <HI>namely,</HI>
that I wou'd not live in <HI>London;</HI> I pretended that
it wou'd choak me up; that I wanted Breath when
I was in <HI>London;</HI> but that any-where el&s;e I wou'd
be &s;atisfied; and then I ask'd him, whether any
Sea-Port Town in <HI>England</HI> wou'd not &s;uit him?
becau&s;e I knew, tho' he &s;eem'd to leave off, he
wou'd always love to be among Bu&s;ine&s;s, and con|ver&s;ing
with Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and I nam'd &s;eve|ral
Places, either neare&s;t for Bu&s;ine&s;s with <HI>France,</HI>
or with <HI>Holland;</HI> as <HI>Dover,</HI> or <HI>Southampton</HI> for the
<HI>fir&s;t;</HI> and <HI>ip&s;wich,</HI> or <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> or <HI>Hull,</HI> for the <HI>la&s;t;</HI>
but I took care that we wou'd re&s;olve upon no|thing
only by this it &s;eem'd to be certain, that
we &s;hou'd live in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It was time now, to bring things to a Con|clu&s;ion,
and &s;o in about &s;ix Weeks time more,
we &s;ettl'd all our Preliminaries; and among the
re&s;t, he let me know, that he &s;hou'd have the Bill
for his <HI>Naturalization</HI> pa&s;s'd time enough; &s;o that
he wou'd be, (<HI>as he call'd it</HI>) an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> before
we <HI>marry'd:</HI> That was &s;oon perfected, the Parlia|ment
being then &s;itting, and &s;everal other Foreign|ers
joining in the &s;aid Bill, to &s;ave the Expence.</P>
<P>It was not above three or four Days after, but
that, without giving me the lea&s;t Notice that he
<PB N="299" REF="304">
had &s;o much as been about the Patent for <HI>Baronet,</HI>
he brought it me in a fine embroider'd Bag; and
&s;aluting me by the Name of my Lady&mdash;(<HI>joining his own Sirname to it</HI>) pre&s;ented it to me,
with his Picture &s;et with Diamonds; and at the
&s;ame time, gave me a Brea&s;t-Jewel worth a thou|&s;and
Pi&s;toles, and the next Morning we were mar|ry'd:
Thus I put an End to all the intrieguing
Part of my Life; a Life full of pro&s;perous Wick|edne&s;s;
the Reflections upon which, were &s;o much
the more afflicting, as the time had been &s;pent in
the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Crimes, which the more I look'd-back
upon, the more black and horrid they appear'd,
effectually drinking up all the Comfort and Satis|faction
which I might otherwi&s;e have taken in that
Part of Life which was &s;till before me.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Satisfaction, however, that I took in
the new Condition I was in, was in reflecting, that
at length the Life of Crime was over; and that
I was like a Pa&s;&s;enger coming back from the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
who having, after many Years Fatigues and
Hurry in Bu&s;ine&s;s, gotten a good E&s;tate, with in|numerable
Difficulties and Hazards, is arriv'd &s;afe
at <HI>London</HI> with all his Effects, and has the Plea|&s;ure
of &s;aying, he &s;hall never venture upon the Seas
any-more.</P>
<P>When we were marry'd, we came back imme|diately
to my Lodgings, (<HI>for the Church was but
ju&s;t-by</HI>) and we were &s;o privately marry'd; that
none but <HI>Amy</HI> and my Friend the QUAKER,
was acquainted with it: As &s;oon as we came into
the Hou&s;e, he took me in his Arms, and ki&s;&s;ing
me, <HI>Now you are my Own,</HI> &s;ays he; <HI>O!</HI> that you
had been &s;o good to have done this, eleven Years
ago: Then, <HI>&s;aid I, you perhaps, wou'd have been tir'd
of me long ago;</HI> 'tis much better now; <HI>for now</HI> all
our happy Days are to come; be&s;ides, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I
<PB N="300" REF="305">
&s;hould not have been half &s;o rich; but that I &s;aid
to my&s;elf, for there was no letting him into
the Rea&s;on of it: O! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I &s;hou'd not been
tir'd of you; but be&s;ides having the Satisfaction
of your Company, it had &s;av'd me that unlucky
Blow at <HI>Paris,</HI> which was a dead Lo&s;s to me, of
above 8000 Pi&s;toles, and all the Fatigues of &s;o
many Years Hurry and Bu&s;ine&s;s; and then <HI>he ad|ded,</HI>
but I'll make you pay for it all, now I have
you: I &s;tarted a little at the Words: <HI>Ay,</HI> &s;aid I,
<HI>do you threaten already?</HI> Pray what d'ye mean by
that? <HI>and began to look a little grave.</HI></P>
<P>I'll tell you, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> very plainly what I mean, and
&s;till he held me fa&s;t in his Arms; I intend from
this time, never to trouble my&s;elf with any-more
Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o I &s;hall never get one Shilling for you,
more than I have already; all that you will lo&s;e
one way; <HI>next,</HI> I intend not to trouble my&s;elf
with any of the Care or Trouble of managing
what either you have for me, or what I have to
add to it; but you &s;hall e'en take it all upon your|&s;elf,
as the Wives do in <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;o you will pay
for it that way too; for all the Drudgery &s;hall be
yours; <HI>thirdly,</HI> I intend to condemn you to the
the con&s;tant Bondage of my impertinent Company,
for I &s;hall tie you like a Pedlar's Pack, at my Back,
I <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;carce ever be from you; for, I am &s;ure, I
can take Delight in nothing el&s;e in this World:
Very well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> but I am pretty heavy, I hope
you'll &s;et me down &s;ometimes, when you are a|weary;
as for that, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> tire me if you can.</P>
<P>This was all Je&s;t and Allegory; but it was all
true, in the Moral of the Fable, as you &s;hall hear
in its Place: We were very merry the re&s;t of
the Day, but without any Noi&s;e, or Clutter; for
he brought not one of his Acquaintance, or Friends,
either <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or Foreigner: The hone&s;t QUAKRE
<PB N="301" REF="306">
provided us a very noble Dinner indeed, con&s;ider|ing
how few we were to eat it; and every Day
that Week &s;he did the like, and wou'd, at la&s;t, have
it be all at her own Charge, which I was utterly
aver&s;e to; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e I knew her Circum&s;tances
not to be very great, tho' not very low; <HI>and next,</HI>
becau&s;e &s;he had been &s;o true a Friend, and &s;o chear|ful
a Comforter to me, <HI>ay, and Coun&s;ellor too,</HI> in all
this Affair, that I had re&s;olv'd to make her a Pre|&s;ent,
that &s;hou'd be &s;ome Help to her when all was
over.</P>
<P>But to return to the Circum&s;tances of our Wed|ding;
after being very merry, <HI>as I have told you,
Amy</HI> and the QUAKER, put us to-Bed, the
hone&s;t QUAKER little-thinking we had been
<HI>a-Bed together</HI> eleven Years before; nay, that was
a Secret which, <HI>as it happen'd, Amy</HI> her&s;elf did not
know: <HI>Amy</HI> grinn'd, and made Faces, as if &s;he
had been pleas'd; but it came out in &s;o many
Words, when he was not by, the Sum of her
mumbling and muttering was, that this &s;hou'd
have been done ten or a dozen Years before; that
it wou'd &s;ignifie little now; <HI>that was to &s;ay, in
&s;hort,</HI> that her Mi&s;tre&s;s was pretty near Fifty,
and too old to have any Children; I chid her;
the QUAKER laugh'd; complimented me upon
my not being &s;o old as <HI>Amy</HI> pretended; that I
cou'd not be above Forty, and might have a Hou&s;e|full
of Children yet; but <HI>Amy</HI> and I too, knew
better than &s;he, how it was; for, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I was old
enough to have done breeding, however I look'd;
but I made her hold her Tongue.</P>
<P>In the Morning my QUAKER-Landlady came
and vi&s;ited us, before we were up, and made us
eat Cakes, and drink Chocolate in-Bed; and then
left us again, and bid us take a Nap upon it,
which I believe we did; in <HI>&s;hort,</HI> &s;he treated us &s;o
<PB N="302" REF="307">
hand&s;omly, and with &s;uch an agreeable Chearful|ne&s;s,
as well as Plenty, as made it appear to me,
that QUAKER may, and that this QUAKER
did, under&s;tand Good-Manners, as well as any|other
People.</P>
<P>I re&s;i&s;ted her Offer, <HI>however,</HI> of treating us for
the whole Week; and I oppos'd it &s;o long, that
I &s;aw evidently that &s;he took it ill, and wou'd
have thought her&s;elf &s;lighted, if we had not ac|cepted
it; &s;o I &s;aid no more, but let her go on,
only told her, I wou'd be even with her, <HI>and &s;o I
was:</HI> However, for that Week &s;he treated us, <HI>as
&s;he &s;aid &s;he wou'd,</HI> and did it &s;o very fine, and with
&s;uch a Profu&s;ion of all &s;orts of good things, that
the greate&s;t Burthen to her was, how to di&s;po&s;e of
things that were left; for &s;he never let any-thing,
how dainty, or however large, be &s;o much as &s;een
twice among us.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome Servants indeed, which help'd her
off a little; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> two Maids, for <HI>Amy</HI>
was now a Woman of Bu&s;ine&s;s, not a Servant, and
eat always with us; I had al&s;o, a Coachman, and
a Boy; my QUAKER had a Man-Servant too,
but had but one Maid; but &s;he borrow'd two
more of &s;ome of her Friends, for the Occa&s;ion;
and had a Man-Cook for dre&s;&s;ing the Victuals.</P>
<P>She was only at a lo&s;s for Plate, which &s;he gave
me a Whi&s;per of; and I made <HI>Amy</HI> fetch a large
&s;trong Box, which I had lodg'd in a &s;afe Hand, in
which was all the fine Plate, which I had provi|ded
on a wor&s;e Occa&s;ion, <HI>as is mention'd before;</HI> and
I put it into the QUAKER'S Hand, obliging
her not to u&s;e it as mine, but as her own, for a
Rea&s;on I &s;hall mention pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>I was now my LADY&mdash;, and I mu&s;t
own, I was exceedingly pleas'd with it; 'twas &s;o
Big, and &s;o Great, to hear my&s;elf call'd <HI>Her Lady|&s;hip,</HI>
<PB N="303" REF="308">
and <HI>Your Lady&s;hip, and the like;</HI> that I was like
the <HI>Indian</HI> King at <HI>Virginia,</HI> who having a Hou&s;e
built for him by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and a Lock put upon
the Door, wou'd &s;it whole Days together, with
the Key in his Hand, locking and unlocking, and
double-locking the Door, with an unaccountable
Plea&s;ure at the Novelty; &s;o I cou'd have &s;at a
whole Day together, to hear <HI>Amy</HI> talk to me, and
call me <HI>Your Lady&s;hip</HI> at every word; but after a|while
the Novelty wore off, and the Pride of it
abated; till at la&s;t, truly, I wanted the other Ti|tle
as much as I did that of <HI>Lady&s;hip</HI> before.</P>
<P>We liv'd this Week in all the Innocent Mirth
imaginable; and our good-humourd QUAKER
was &s;o plea&s;ent in her Way, that it was particu|larly
entertaining to us: We had no Mu&s;ick at-all,
or Dancing; only I now and then &s;ung a <HI>French</HI>
Song, to divert my Spou&s;e, who de&s;ir'd it, and
the privacy of our Mirthgretly added to the
Plea&s;ure of it: I did not make many Cloaths for
my Wedding, having always a great-many rich
Cloaths by me, which with a little altering for
the Fa&s;ion were cperfectly new: The next Day
he pre&s;s'd me to dre&s;s, tho' we had no Company;
at la&s;t, je&s;ting with him, I told him, I believ'd I
was able to dre&s;s me &s;o, in one kind of Dre&s;s that
I had by me, that he wou'd not know his Wife
when he &s;aw her, e&s;pecially if any-body el&s;e was
by: <HI>No!</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>that was impo&s;&s;ible;</HI> and he long'd
to &s;ee that Dre&s;s; <HI>I told him,</HI> I wou'd dre&s;s me
in it, if he wou'd promi&s;e me never to de&s;ire me
to appear in it before Company; he promis'd he
wou'd not, but wanted to know <HI>why</HI> too; as
Husbands, you know, are inqui&s;itive Creatures,
and love to enquire after any-thing they think is
kept from them; but I had an An&s;wer ready for
him; becau&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> it is not a decent Dre&s;s in
<PB N="304" REF="309">
this Country, and wou'd not look mode&s;t; nei|ther
indeed, wou'd it, for it was but one Degree off,
from appearing in one's Shift; but was the u&s;ual
Wear in the Country where they were u&s;ed: He
was &s;atisfy'd with my An&s;wer, and gave me his
Promi&s;e, never to ask me to be &s;een in it before
Company: I then withdrew, taking only <HI>Amy</HI>
and the <HI>QUAKER</HI> with me; and <HI>Amy</HI> dre&s;s'd
me in my old <HI>Turki&s;h Habit</HI> which I danc'd in for|merly,
<HI>&amp;c. as before:</HI> The QUAKER was charm'd
with the Dre&s;s, <HI>and merrily &s;aid,</HI> That if &s;uch
a Dre&s;s &s;hou'd come to be worn here, &s;he &s;hou'd
not know what to do; &s;he &s;hou'd be tempted not
to dre&s;s in the QUAKERS Way any-more.</P>
<P>When all the Dre&s;s was put on, I loaded it with
Jewels, and in particular, I plac'd the large Brea&s;t-Jewel
which he had given me, of a thou&s;and Pi|&s;toles,
upon the Front of the <HI>Tyhaia,</HI> or Head-Dre&s;s;
where it made a mo&s;t glorious Show in|deed;
I had my own Diamond-Necklace on, and
my Hair was <HI>Tout Brilliant,</HI> all glittering with
Jewels.</P>
<P>His Picture &s;et with Diamonds, I had plac'd
&s;titch'd to my Ve&s;t, ju&s;t, <HI>as might be &s;uppos'd,</HI> upon
my Heart, (which is the Compliment in &s;uch Ca&s;es
among the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> People) and all being open at
the Brea&s;t, there was no room for any-thing of a
Jewel there: In this Figure <HI>Amy</HI> holding the
Train of my Robe, I came down to him: He
was &s;urpriz'd, and perfectly a&s;toni&s;h'd; he knew
me, <HI>to be&s;ure,</HI> becau&s;e I had prepar'd him, and be|cau&s;e
there was no-body el&s;e there, but the QUAKER
and <HI>Amy;</HI> but he by no means knew <HI>Amy;</HI> for
&s;he had dre&s;s'd her&s;elf in the Habit of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Slave, being the Garb of my <HI>little Turk,</HI> which I
had at <HI>Naples, as I have &s;aid;</HI> &s;he had her Neck
and Arms bare; was bare-headed, and her Hair
<PB N="305" REF="310">
breeded in a long To&s;&s;el hanging down her Back;
but the Jade cou'd neither hold her Countenance,
or her chattering Tongue, &s;o as to be conceal'd
long.</P>
<P>Well, he was &s;o charm'd with this Dre&s;s, that
he wou'd have me &s;it and dine in it; but it was
&s;o thin, and &s;o open before, and the Weather be|ing
al&s;o &s;harp, that I was afraid of taking Cold;
however, the Fire being enlarged, and the Doors
kept &s;hut, I &s;at to oblige him; and he profe&s;s'd,
he never &s;aw &s;o fine a Dre&s;s in his Life: I after|wards
told him, that my Husband (<HI>&s;o he call'd the</HI>
jeweller <HI>that was kill'd</HI>) bought it for me, at <HI>Leg|horn,</HI>
with a young <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Slave, which I parted
with at <HI>Paris;</HI> and that it was by the help of that
Slave that I learn'd how to dre&s;s in it, and how
every-thing was to be worn, and many of the
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms al&s;o, with &s;ome of their Lan|guage;
this Story agreeing with the Fact, only
changing the Per&s;on, was very natural, and &s;o it
went off with him; but there was good Rea&s;on
why I &s;hou'd not receive any Company in this
Dre&s;s, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> not in <HI>England; I need not re|peat
it; you will hear more of it.</HI></P>
<P>But when I came Abroad, I frequently put it
on, and upon two or three Occa&s;ions danc'd in
it, but always at his Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>We continued at the QUAKER'S Lodgings for
above a Year; for now making as tho' it was dif|ficult
to determine where to &s;ettle in <HI>England</HI> to
his Satisfaction, unle&s;s in <HI>London,</HI> which was not
to mine; I pretended to make him an Offer, that
to oblige him, I began to incline to go and live A|broad
with him; that I knew nothing could be
more agreeable to him, and that as to me, every
Place was alike; that as I had liv'd Abroad without
a Husband &s;o many Years, it cou'd be no
<PB N="306" REF="311">
Burthen to me to live Abroad again, <HI>e&s;pecially
with him;</HI> then we fell to &s;training our Courte|&s;ies
upon one-another; he told me, he was per|fectly
ea&s;ie at living in <HI>England,</HI> and had &s;quar'd
all his Affairs accordingly; for that, as he had
told me he intended to give over all Bu&s;ine&s;s in
the World, as well the Care of managing it, as
the Concern about it; &s;eeing we were both in
Condition, neither to want it, or to have it
be worth our while; or I might &s;ee it was his
Intention, by his setting, him&s;elf Naturaliz'd,
and getting the Patent of Baronet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Well,
for-all that, I told him, I accepted his Com|pliment,
but I cou'd not but know that his Na|tive
Country, where his Children were breeding
up, mu&s;t be mo&s;t agreeable to him, and that if I
was of &s;uch Value to him, I wou'd be there then,
to enhan&s;e the rate of his Satisfaction; that where|ever
he was, wou'd be a Home to me; and any
Place in the World wou'd be <HI>England</HI> to me, if
he was with me; and thus, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I brought
him to give me leave to oblige him with going to
live Abroad; when in truth, I cou'd not have
been perfectly ea&s;ie at living in <HI>England,</HI> unle&s;s
I had kept constantly within-doors; le&s;t &s;ome time or
other, the di&s;&s;olute Life I had liv'd here, &s;hou'd
have come to be known; and all tho&s;e wicked
things have been known too, which I now began
to be very much a&s;ham'd of.</P>
<P>When we clos'd up our Wedding-Week, in
which our QUAKER had been &s;o very hand|&s;ome
to us, I told him how much thought we
were oblig'd to her for her generous Carriage to
us; how &s;he had acted the kinde&s;t Part thro' the
whole, and how faithful a Friend &s;he had been to
me, upon all Occa&s;ions; and then letting him
know a little of her Family Unhappine&s;&s;es, I pro|pos'd,
<PB N="307" REF="312">
that I thought I not only ought to be grate|ful
to her, but really to do &s;omething extraor|dinary
for her, towards making her ea&s;ie in her
Affairs; <HI>and I added,</HI> that I had no hangers-on,
that &s;hou'd trouble him; that there was no-body
belong'd to me, but what was thorowly provided
for; and that if I did &s;omething for this hone&s;t
Women, that was con&s;iderable, it &s;hou'd be the
la&s;t Gift I wou'd give to any-body in the World,
<HI>but Amy;</HI> and as for her, we was not a-going to
turn her adrift, but whenever any-thing offer'd,
for her, we wou'd do as we &s;aw Cau&s;e; that <HI>in
the mean time, Amy</HI> was not poor; that &s;he had&s;-av'd
together between &s;even and eight Hundred
Pounds; <HI>by the way, I did not tell him how, and by
what wicked Ways &s;he had got it;</HI> but <HI>that &s;he had it;</HI>
and that was enough to let him know &s;he wou'd
never be in want of us.</P>
<P>My Spou&s;e was exceedingly pleas'd with my
Di&s;cour&s;e about the QUAKER, made a kind of a
Speech to me upon the Subject of Gratitude;
<HI>told me,</HI> it was one of the brighte&s;t Parts of a Gen|tlewoman;
that it was &s;o twi&s;ted with Hone&s;ty,
<HI>nay,</HI> and even with Religion too, that he que&s;ti|on'd
whether either of them cou'd be found, where
Gratitude was not to be found; that in this Act
there was not only Gratitude, but Charity; and
that to make the Charity &s;till more Chri&s;tian-like,
the Object too had real Merit to attract it; he
therefore agreed to the thing with all his Heart,
only wou'd have had me let him pay it out of his
Effects.</P>
<P>I told him, <HI>as for that,</HI> I did not de&s;ign <HI>what|ever
I had &s;aid formerly,</HI> that we &s;hou'd have <HI>two
Pockets;</HI> and that tho' I had talk'd to him of being
a Free Woman, and an Independent, <HI>and the like,</HI>
and he had offer'd and promis'd that I &s;hou'd keep
<PB N="308" REF="313">
all my own E&s;tate in my own Hands; yet, that
&s;ince I had taken him, I wou'd e'en do as other
<HI>hone&s;t Wives</HI> did, where I thought fit to give my|&s;elf,
I &s;hou'd give what I had too; that if I re|&s;erv'd
any-thing, it &s;hou'd be only in ca&s;e of Mor|tality,
and that I might give it to his Children af|terwards,
<HI>as my own Gift;</HI> and that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> if he
thought fit to join Stocks, we wou'd &s;ee to Mor|row
Morning, what Strength we cou'd both make
up in the World, and bringing it all together, con|&s;ider
before we re&s;olv'd upon the Place of remo|ving,
how we &s;hou'd di&s;po&s;e of what we had, as
well as of our&s;elves: This Di&s;cour&s;e was too obli|ging,
and he too much a Man of Sence, not to
receive it, as it was meant; <HI>he only an&s;wer'd,</HI> We
wou'd do in that, as we &s;hou'd both agree; but
the thing under our pre&s;ent Care, was to &s;hew not
Gratitude only, but Charity and Affection too, to
our kind Friend the QUAKER; and the fir&s;t
Word he &s;poke of, was to &s;ettle a thou&s;and Pounds
upon her, <HI>for her Life, that is to &s;ay,</HI> &s;ixty Pounds
a Year; but in &s;uch a manner, as not to be in the
Power of any Per&s;on to reach, but her&s;elf: This
was a great thing, and indeed, &s;hew'd the generous
Principles of my Husband, and for that rea&s;on I
mention it; but I thought that a little too much
too, and particularly, becau&s;e I had another thing
in View for her, about the Plate; &s;o I told him,
I thought if he gave her a Pur&s;e with a Hundred
Guineas as a Pre&s;ent <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and then made her a
Compliment of. 40 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> for her Life, &s;e|cur'd
any &s;uch Way as &s;he &s;hou'd de&s;ire, it wou'd
be very hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>He agreed to that; and the &s;ame Day, in the
Evening, when we were ju&s;t going to-Bed, he
took my QUAKER by the Hand, and with a
Ki&s;s, told her, That we had been very kindly
<PB N="309" REF="314">
treated by her from the beginning of this Affair,
and his Wife before, as &s;he, (<HI>meaning me</HI>) had in|form'd
him; and that he thought him&s;elf bound
to let her &s;ee, that &s;he had oblig'd Friends who
knew how to be grateful; that for his Part of the
Obligation, he de&s;ir'd &s;he wou'd accept of <HI>that,</HI>
for an Acknowledgment in Part only, (<HI>putting the
Gold into her Hand</HI>) and that his Wife wou'd talk
with her about what farther he had to &s;ay to her;
and upon that, not giving her time hardly to &s;ay
<HI>thank ye,</HI> away he went up-Stairs, into our Bed-Chamber,
leaving her confus'd, and not knowing
what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>When he was gone, &s;he began to make very
hand&s;ome and obliging Repre&s;entations of her
Good-will to us both, but that it was without
Expectation of Reward; that I had given her
&s;everal valuable Presents before, <HI>and &s;o indeed I
had;</HI> for, be&s;ides the Piece of Linnen which I had
given her <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> I had given her a Suit of Da|mask
<HI>Table-Linnen,</HI> of the. Linneh I bought for my
Balls, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Table-cloths, and three Dozen
of Napkins; and at another time, I gave her a
little Necklace of Gold Beads, <HI>and the like;</HI> but
that is <HI>by the way;</HI> but &s;he mention'd them, <HI>I &s;ay;</HI>
and how &s;he was obl'g'd by me, on many other Oc|ca&s;ions;
that &s;he was not in Condition to &s;how
her Gratitude any other way, not being able to
make a &s;uitable Return; and that now we took
from her all Opportunity to ballance my former
Friend&s;hip, and left her more in Debt than &s;he
was before: She &s;poke this in a very good kind
of a Manner, <HI>in her own way,</HI> but which was very
agreeable, indeed, and had as much apparent Sin|cerity,
and I verily believe as real, as was po&s;&s;ible
to be expre&s;s'd; but I put a Stop to it, and bid
her &s;ay no more, but accept of what my Spou&s;e
<PB N="310" REF="315">
had given her, which was but in Part, as &s;he had
heard him &s;ay; and <HI>put it up,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>and come and
&s;it down here, and give me Leave to &s;ay &s;omething el&s;e
to you, on the &s;ame Head, which my Spou&s;e and I have
&s;ettled between our&s;elves, in your Behalf;</HI> What do&s;t
Thee mean, <HI>&s;ays &s;he?</HI> and blu&s;h'd, and look'd
&s;urpriz'd, but did not &s;tir; &s;he was going to &s;peak
again, but I interrupted her, and told her, &s;he
&s;hou'd make no more Apologies of any kind what|ever,
for I had better things than all this, to talk
to her of; &s;o I went on, and told her, That as
&s;he had been &s;o friendly and kind to us on every
Occa&s;ion; and that her Hou&s;e was the lucky Place
where we came together; and that &s;he knew I
was from her own Mouth, acquainted in Part, with
her Circum&s;tances, we were re&s;olv'd &s;he &s;hou'd be
the better for us, as long as &s;he liv'd: Then I
told her what we had re&s;olv'd to do for her;
and that &s;he had nothing more to do, but to con|&s;ult
with me, how it &s;hou'd be effectually &s;ecur'd
for her, di&s;tinct from any of the Effects which
were her Husband's; and that if her Husband did
&s;o &s;upply her, that &s;he cou'd live comfortably, and
not want it for Bread, or other Nece&s;&s;aries, &s;he
&s;hou'd not make U&s;e of it, but lay up the Income
of it, and add it every Year to the Principal, &s;o
to encrea&s;e the Annual Payment, which in time,
and perhaps before &s;he might come to want it,
might double it&s;elf; that we were very willing
whatever &s;he &s;hou'd &s;o lay up, &s;hou'd be to her|&s;elf,
and whoever &s;he thought fit after her; but
that the forty Pound a-Year, mu&s;t return to our
Family, after her Life; which we both wi&s;h'd
might be long and happy.</P>
<P>Let no Reader wonder at my extraordinary
Concern for this poor Woman; or at my giving
my Bounty to her a Place in this Account; it is
<PB N="311" REF="316">
not, <HI>I a&s;&s;ure you,</HI> to make a Pageantry of my Cha|rity,
or to value my&s;elf upon the Greatne&s;s of my
Soul; that &s;hou'd give in &s;o profu&s;e a Manner as
this, which was above my Figure, if my Wealth
had been twice as much as it was; but there was
another Spring from whence all flow'd, and 'tis on
that Account I &s;peak of it: Was it po&s;&s;ible I cou'd
think of a poor de&s;olate Woman with four Chil|dren,
and her Husband gone from her, <HI>and per|haps
good for little if he had &s;tay'd; I &s;ay,</HI> was I,
that had ta&s;ted &s;o deep of the Sorrows of &s;uch a
kind of Widowhood, able to look on her, and
think of her Circum&s;tances, and not be touch'd
in an uncommon Manner? No, No, I never look'd
on her, and her Family, tho' &s;he was not left &s;o
helple&s;s and friendle&s;s as I had been, without re|membring
my own Condition; when <HI>Amy</HI> was &s;ent
out to pawn or &s;ell my <HI>Pair of Stays,</HI> to buy a
Brea&s;t of Mutton, and a Bunch of Turnips; nor
cou'd I look on her poor Children, tho' not poor
and peri&s;hing, like mine, without Tears; reflect|ing
on the dreadful Condition that mine were re|duc'd
to, when poor <HI>Amy</HI> &s;ent them all into their
Aunt's in <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> and run away from them:
The&s;e were the Original Springs, or Fountain-Head,
from whence my Affectionate Thoughts
were mov'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t this poor Woman.</P>
<P>When a poor Debtor, having lain long in the
<HI>Compter,</HI> or <HI>Ludgate,</HI> or the <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI> for Debt,
afterwards gets out, ri&s;es again in the World,
and grows rich &s;uch an one is a certain Bene|factor
to the Pri&s;oners there, and perhaps to every
Pri&s;on he pa&s;&s;es by, as long as he lives; for he
remembers the dark Days of his own Sorrow;
and even tho&s;e who never had the Experience

Di&s;po&s;ition, did they as &s;en&s;ibly remember what
it is, that di&s;tingui&s;hes them from others, by a
more favourable and merciful Providence.</P>
<P>This, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> was however, the Spring of my
Concern for this hone&s;t friendly and grateful
QUAKER, and as I had &s;o plentiful a Fortune
in the World, I re&s;olv'd &s;he &s;hould ta&s;te the
Fruit of her kind U&s;age to me, in a manner that
&s;he cou'd not expect.</P>
<P>All the while I talk'd to her, I &s;aw the Di&s;|order
of her Mind; the &s;udden Joy was too
much for her, and &s;he colour'd, trembled, chang'd,
and at la&s;t grew pale, and was indeed near faint|ing;
when &s;he ha&s;tily rung a little Bell for her
Maid, who coming in immediately, &s;he beckon'd
to her, <HI>for &s;peak &s;he cou'd not,</HI> to fill her a Gla&s;s
of Wine, but &s;he had no Breath to take it in,
and was almo&s;t choak'd with that which &s;he
took in her Mouth; I &s;aw &s;he was ill, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted
her what I cou'd, and with Spirits and things
to &s;mell too, ju&s;t kept her from Fainting, when
&s;he beckon'd to her Maid to withdraw, and im|mediately
bur&s;t our in crying, and that reliev'd
her; when &s;he recover'd her&s;elf a little, &s;he flew
to me and throwing her Arms about my Neck,
O! <HI>&s;ays &s;he, thou ha&s;t almo&s;t kill'd me;</HI> and there
&s;he hung, laying her Head in my Neck for half
a quarter of an Hour, not able to &s;peak, but
&s;obbing like a Child that had been whipp'd.</P>
<P>I was very &s;orry, that I did not &s;top a little, in
the middle of my Di&s;c$ur&s;e, and make her drink
a Gla&s;s of Wine, before it had put her Spirits into
&s;uch a violent Motion; but it was too late, and
it was ten to one odds, but that it had kill'd
her.</P>
<P>But &s;he came to her&s;elf at la&s;t, and began to
&s;ay &s;ome very good things in return for my
<PB N="313" REF="318">
kindne&s;s; I would not let her go on, but
<HI>told her,</HI> I had more to &s;ay to her &s;till, than all
this, but that I would let it alone till another
time; my meaning was, about the Box of Plate,
good part of which I gave her, and &s;ome I gave
to <HI>Amy,</HI> for I had &s;o much Plate, and &s;ome &s;o
large, that I thought if I let my Husband &s;ee it,
he might be apt to wonder what Occa&s;ion I
cou'd ever have for &s;o much, and for Plate of
&s;uch a kind too; as particularly, a great Ci&s;tern
for Bottles, which co&s;t a hundred and twenty
Pounds, and &s;ome large Candle&s;ticks, too big, for
any ordinary U&s;e: The&s;e I caus'd <HI>Amy</HI> to &s;ell;
<HI>in &s;hort, Amy</HI> &s;old above three hundred Pound's-worth
of Plate; what I gave the QUAKER,
was worth above &s;ixty Pounds, and I gave <HI>Amy</HI>
above thirty Pound's-worth, and yet I had a
great-deal left for my Husband.</P>
<P>Nor did our Kindne&s;s to the QUAKER end
with the forty Pound a Year, for we were always,
while we &s;tay'd with her, which was above ten
Months, giving her one good thing or another;
and, <HI>in a word,</HI> in&s;tead of Lodging with her, &s;he
Boarded with us, for I kept the Hou&s;e, and &s;he
and all her Family eat and drank with us, and
yet we paid her the Rent of the Hou&s;e too;
<HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I remember'd <HI>my Widowhood,</HI> and I
made this Widow's Heart glad many a Day
the more, upon that Account.</P>
<P>And now my Spou&s;e and I begun to think o$
going over to <HI>Holland,</HI> where I had propos'd to
him to live, and in order to &s;ettle all the Preli|minaries
of our future Manner of Living, I began
to draw in my Effects, &s;o as to have them all
at Command, upon whatever Occa&s;ion we thought
fit; after which, <HI>one Morning</HI> I call'd my Spou&s;e
up to me; hark ye, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> I have
<PB N="314" REF="319">
two very weighty Que&s;tions to ask of you; I
don't know what An&s;wer you will give to the
<HI>fir&s;t,</HI> but I doubt you will be able to give but
a &s;orry An&s;wer to the <HI>other,</HI> and yet, <HI>I a&s;&s;ure
you,</HI> it is of the la&s;t Importance to your&s;elf, and
towards the future Part of your Life, wherever
it is to be.</P>
<P>He did not &s;eem, to be much alarm'd, becau&s;e
he could &s;ee I was &s;peaking in a kind of merry
way, <HI>Let's hear your Que&s;tions,</HI> my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,
and I'll give the be&s;t An&s;wer I can to them:</HI> Why
fir&s;t, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI>
1. You have marry'd a Wife here, made her
a <HI>Lady,</HI> and put her in Expectation of being
&s;omething el&s;e &s;till, when &s;he comes Abroad;
pray have you examin'd whether you are
able to &s;upply all her extravagant Demands
when &s;he comes Abroad; and maintain an
expen&s;ive <HI>Engli&s;hwoman</HI> in all her Pride, and
Vanity? <HI>In &s;hort,</HI> have you, enquir'd whether
you are able to keep her?</P>
<P>2. You have marry'd a Wife here, and given
her a great many fine things, and you main|tain
her like a <HI>Prince&s;s,</HI> and &s;ometimes call
her <HI>&s;o;</HI> pray what Portion have you had
with her? what Fortune has &s;he been to
you? and where does her E&s;tate lie, that
you keep her &s;o fine? I am afraid you keep
her in a Figure a great-deal above her E&s;tate,
<HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> above all that you have &s;een of it
yet? are you &s;ure you ha'n't got a <HI>Bite?</HI> and
that you have not made a Beggar a <HI>Lady?</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> have you any more Que&s;tions
to ask? let's have them all together, perhaps they
may be all an&s;wer'd in a few Words, as well
<PB N="315" REF="320">
as the&s;e two: No, &s;ays I, the&s;e are the two grand
Que&s;tions, at lea&s;t, for the pre&s;ent: Why then,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I'll an&s;wer you in a few Words, That
I am fully Ma&s;ter of my qwn Circum&s;tances,
and without father Enquiry, can let my Wife
you &s;peak of, know, that as I have made her a
<HI>Lady,</HI> I can maintain her <HI>as a Lady,</HI> wherever &s;he
goes with me; and this, whether &s;he has any Pi|&s;tole
of her Portion, or whether I have one Por|tion
or no: And as I have not enquir'd whether
&s;he has any Portion or not, &s;o &s;he &s;hall not have
the le&s;s Re&s;pect &s;hew'd her from me, or be oblig'd
to live meaner, or be any-ways &s;traiten'd on that
Account; on the contrary, if &s;he goes Abroad to
live with me in my own Country, I will make
her more than a <HI>Lady</HI> and &s;upport the Expence
of it too, without meddling with any-thing &s;he
has; and this I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> contains an An|&s;wer
to both your Que&s;tion together.</P>
<P>He &s;poke this with a great deal more Earne&s;t|ne&s;s
in his Countenance, than I had when I
propos'd my Que&s;tions; and &s;aid a great-many
kind things upon it, as the Con&s;equence of for|mer
Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;o that I was oblig'd to be in
earne&s;t too; My Dear, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I was but in je&s;t
in my Que&s;tions; but they were propos'd to in|troduce
what I am going to &s;ay to you in ear|ne&s;t;
<HI>namely,</HI> that if I am to go Abroad, 'tis time
I &s;hou'd let you know how things &s;tand, and what
I have to bring you, with your Wife; how it is to
be di&s;pos'd, and &s;ecur'd, <HI>and the like;</HI> and there|fore
come, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> &s;it down, and let me &s;how you
your Bargain here; I hope you will find, that
you have not got a Wife without a Fortune.</P>
<P>He told me then, that &s;ince he found I was in
earne&s;t, he de&s;ir'd that I wou'd adjourn it till to-Morrow,
and then we wou'd do as the poor Peo|ple
<PB N="316" REF="321">
do after they Marry, feel in their Pockets, and
&s;ee how much Money they can bring together in
the World; well <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> with all my Heart; and
&s;o we ended our Talk for that time.</P>
<P>As this was in the Morning, my Spou&s;e went
out after Dinner to his Gold&s;mith's, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> and
about three Hours after, returns with a Porter and
two large Boxes, with him; and his Servant
brought another Box, which I ob&s;erv'd was almo&s;t
as heavy as the two that the Porter brought, and
made the poor Fellow &s;weat heartily; he di&s;|mi&s;s'd
the Porter, and in a little-while after went
out again with his Man, and returning at Night,
brought another Porter with more Boxes and Bun|dles,
and all was carried up, and put into a Cham|ber,
next to our Bed-Chamber, and in the Morn|ing
he call'd for a pretty large round Table, and
began to unpack.</P>
<P>When the Boxes were open'd, I found they
were chiefly full of Books, and Papers, and Parch|ments,
<HI>I mean,</HI> Books of Accompts, and Writings,
<HI>and &s;uch things,</HI> as were in them&s;elves of no Mo|ment
to me, becau&s;e I under&s;tood them not; but
I perceiv'd he took them all out, and &s;pread them
about him, upon the Table, and Chairs, and began
to be very bu&s;ie with them; &s;o I withdrew, and
left him; and he was indeed, &s;o bu&s;ie among them,
that he never mi&s;s'd me, till I had been gone a
good-while; but when he had gone thro' all his
Papers, and come to open a little Box, he call'd
for me again; Now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and call'd me <HI>his
Counte&s;s,</HI> I am ready to an&s;wer your <HI>fir&s;t Que&s;tion;</HI>
it you will &s;it down till I have open'd <HI>this Box,</HI>
we will &s;ee how it &s;tands.</P>
<P>So we open'd the Box; there was in it indeed,
what I did not expect, for I thought he had &s;unk
his E&s;tate, rather than rais'd it; but he produc'd
<PB N="317" REF="322">
me in Gold&s;miths Bills, and Stock in the <HI>Engli&s;h
Ea&s;t-India Company,</HI> about &s;ixteen thou&s;and Pounds
Sterling; then he gave into my Hands, nine A&s;|&s;ignment
upon the Bank of <HI>Lyons</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and
two upon the Rents of the Town-Hou&s;e in <HI>Paris,</HI>
amounting in the whole to 5800 Crowns <HI>per An|num,</HI>
or annual Rent, <HI>as 'tis call'd there;</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI>
the Sum of 30000 <HI>Rixdollars</HI> in the Bank of <HI>Am|&s;terdam;</HI>
be&s;ides &s;ome Jewels and Gold in the Box,
to the Value of about 15 or 1600 <HI>l.</HI> among which
was a very good Necklace of Pearl, of about 200 <HI>l.</HI>
Value; and that he pull'd out, and ty'd about
my Neck; telling me, That &s;hou'd not be reckon'd
into the Account.</P>
<P>I was equally pleas'd and &s;urpriz'd; and it was
with an inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy, that I &s;aw him &s;o rich:
You might well tell me, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> that you were able
to make me <HI>Counte&s;s,</HI> and maintain me as &s;uch: <HI>In
&s;hort,</HI> he was immen&s;ly rich; for be&s;ides all this,
he &s;hew'd me, which was the Rea&s;on of his be|ing
&s;o bu&s;ie among the Books, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> he &s;hew'd
me &s;everal Adventures he had Abroad, in the Bu|&s;ine&s;s
of his Merchandize; as particularly, an
eighth Share in an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ship then Abroad $
an Account-Courant with a Merchant, at <HI>Cadiz</HI>
in <HI>Spain;</HI> about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> lent upon <HI>Bottomree,</HI>
upon Ships gone to the <HI>Indies;</HI> and a large Cargo
of Goods in a Merchant's Hands, for Sale, at <HI>Li&s;|bon</HI>
in <HI>Portugal;</HI> &s;o that in his Books there was a|bout
12000 <HI>l.</HI> more; all which put together, made
about 27000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, and 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>I &s;tood amaz'd at this Account, <HI>as well I might,</HI>
and &s;aid nothing to him for a good-while, and the
rather, becau&s;e I &s;aw him &s;till bu&s;ie, looking over
his Books: After a-while, as I was going to ex|pre&s;s
my Wonder; <HI>Hold,</HI> my Dear, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> this is
not all neither; then he pull'd me out &s;ome old
<PB N="318" REF="323">
Seals, and &s;mall Parchment-Rolls, which I did
not under&s;tand; <HI>but he told me,</HI> they were a Right
of Rever&s;ion which he had to a Paternal E&s;tate
in his Family, and a Mortgage of 14000 <HI>Rixdol|lars,</HI>
which he had upon it, in the Hands of the
pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; &s;o that was about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> more.</P>
<P>But now hold again, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for I mu&s;t pay my
Debts out of all this, and they are very great, <HI>I
a&s;&s;ure you;</HI> and the <HI>fir&s;t, he &s;aid,</HI> was a black Article
of 8000 Pi&s;toles, which he had a Law-Suit about,
at <HI>Paris,</HI> but had it awarded again&s;t him, which
was the Lo&s;s he had told me of, and which made
him leave <HI>Paris</HI> in Di&s;gu&s;t; that in other Accounts
he ow'd about 5300 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling; but after all this,
upon the whole, he had &s;till 17000 <HI>l.</HI> clear Stock
in Money, and 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a-Year in Rent.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Pau&s;e, it came to my Turn to &s;peak;
Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> 'tis very hard a Gentleman with
&s;uch a Fortune as this, &s;hou'd come over to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and marry a Wife with <HI>Nothing;</HI> it &s;hall ne|ver,
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> be &s;aid, but what I have, I'll bring into
the Publick Stock; &s;o I began to produce.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I pull'd out the Mortgage which good Sir
<HI>Robert</HI> had procur'd for me, the annual Rent 700 <HI>l.
per Annum;</HI> the principal Money 14000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I pull'd out another Mortgage upon
Land, procur'd by the &s;ame faithful Friend, which
at three times, had advanc'd 12000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I pull'd him out a Parcel of little Se|curities,
procur'd by &s;everal Hands, by Fee-Farm
Rents, and &s;uch Petty Mortgages as tho&s;e Times
afforded, amounting to 10800 <HI>l.</HI> principal Money,
and paying &s;ix hundred and thirty &s;ix Pounds a-Year;
&s;o that in the whole, there was two thou|&s;and
fifty &s;ix Pounds a-Year, Ready-Money con|&s;tantly
coming in.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="324">
When I had &s;hewn him all the&s;e, I laid them
upon the Table, and bade him take them, that
he might be able to give me an An&s;wer to the
<HI>&s;econd Que&s;tion</HI> viz. <HI>What Fortune he had with his
Wife?</HI> and laugh'd a little at it.</P>
<P>He look'd at them a-while, and then handed
them all back again to me; I will not touch them,
&s;ays he, nor one of them, till they are all &s;ettl'd in
Tru&s;tees Hands, for your own U&s;e, and the Ma|nagement
wholly your own.</P>
<P>I cannot omit what happen'd to me while all
this was acting, tho' it was chearful Work in
the main, yet I trembled every Joint or me, wor&s;e
for ought I know, than ever <HI>Bel&s;hazzer</HI> did at the
Hand-writing on the Wall, and the Occa&s;ion was
every way as ju&s;t: &V;nhappy Wretch, &s;aid I to my|&s;elf,
<HI>&s;hall my ill-got Wealth, the Product of</HI> pro&s;pe|rous
Lu&s;t, <HI>and of a vile and vicious Life</HI> of Whore|dom
and Adultery, <HI>be intermingled with the hone&s;t
well-gotten E&s;tate of this innocent Gentleman, to be
a Moth and a Catterpiller among it, and bring the
Judgments of Heaven upon him, and upon what he
has, for my &s;ake! Shall my Wickedne&s;s bla&s;t his Com|forts!
Shall I</HI> be Fire in his Flax! <HI>and be a Means
to provoke Heaven to cur&s;e his Ble&s;&s;ings!</HI> God for|bid!
<HI>I'll keep them a&s;under, if it be po&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>This is the true Rea&s;on why I have been &s;o par|ticular
in the Account of my va&s;t acquir'd Stock;
and how his E&s;tate, which was perhaps, the Pro|duct
of many Years fortunate Industry; and which
was equal, if not &s;uperior, to mine, at be&s;t, was <HI>at
my Reque&s;t,</HI> kept apart from mine, <HI>as is mention'd
above.</HI></P>
<P>I have told you how he gave back all my
Writings into my own Hands again; <HI>Well, &s;ays I,</HI>
&s;eeing you will have it be kept apart, <HI>it &s;hall be
&s;o,</HI> upon one Condition, which I have to propo&s;e,
<PB N="320" REF="325">
and no other; and what is the Condition, <HI>&s;ays he?</HI>
why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> all the Pretence I can have for the
making-over my own E&s;tate to me, is, that in
Ca&s;e of your Mortallity, I may have it re&s;erv'd
for me, if I out-live you; well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that is
true: But then, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> the Annual Income is
always received by the Husband, during his Life,
as 'tis &s;uppos'd for the mutual Sub&s;i&s;tance of the
Family; now, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> here is 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, which
I believe is as much as we &s;hall &s;pend, and I
de&s;ire none of it may be &s;av'd; and all the
Income of your own E&s;tate, the Intere&s;t of the
17000 <HI>l.</HI> and the 1320 <HI>l.</HI> a Year may be con&s;tantly
laid by for the Encrea&s;e of your E&s;tate, and &s;o,
<HI>added I,</HI> by joining the Intere&s;t every Year to the
Capital, you will perhaps grow as rich as you
would do, if you were to Trade with it all, if
you were oblig'd to keep Hou&s;e out of it too.</P>
<P>He lik'd the Propo&s;al very well, <HI>and &s;aid</HI> it
&s;hould be &s;o; and this way I, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure,
&s;atisfied my&s;elf, that I &s;hould not bring my Hu&s;|band
under the Bla&s;t of a ju&s;t Providence, for
mingling my cur&s;ed ill-gotten Wealth with his
hone&s;t E&s;tate: This was occa&s;ion'd by the Reflecti|ons
which at &s;ome certain Intervals of time, came
into my Thoughts, of the Ju&s;tice oF Heaven, which
I had rea&s;on to expect would &s;ometime or other &s;till fall
upon me or my Effects, for the dreadful Life
I had liv'd.</P>
<P>And let no-body conclude from the &s;trange Suc|ce&s;s
I met with in all my wicked Doings, and the
va&s;t E&s;tate which I had rais'd by it, that there|fore
I either was happy or ea&s;ie: No, no, there was
a Dart &s;truck into the Liver; there was a &s;ecret
Hell within, even all the while, when our Joy was
at the highe&s;t; but more e&s;pecially <HI>now,</HI> after it
was all over, and when according to all appearance,
<PB N="321" REF="326">
I was one of the happie&s;t Women upon Earth,
all this while, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I had &s;uch a con&s;tant Terror
upon my Mind, as gave me every now and then ve|ry
terrible Shocks, and which made me expect &s;ome|thing
very frightful upon every Accident of Life.</P>
<P><HI>In a word,</HI> it never Lightn'd or Thunder'd, but
I expected the next Fla&s;h wou'd penetrate my
Vitals, and melt the Sword [<HI>Soul</HI>] in this Scab|bord
of Fle&s;h; it never blew a Storm of Wind,
but I expected the Fall of &s;ome Stack of Chim|neys,
or &s;ome Part of the Hou&s;e wou'd bury me
in its Ruins; and &s;o of other things.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall perhaps, have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of
all the&s;e things again by-and-by; the Ca&s;e before
us was in a manner &s;ettl'd; we had full four thou|&s;and
Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for our future Sub&s;i&s;tence,
be&s;ides a va&s;t Sum in Jewels and Plate; and be|&s;ides
this, I had about eight thou&s;and Pounds re|&s;erv'd
in Money, which I kept back from him, to
provide for my two Daughters; of whom I have
yet much to &s;ay.</P>
<P>With this E&s;tate, &s;ettl'd as you have heard,
and with the be&s;t Husband in the World, I left
<HI>England</HI> again; I had not only in humane Pru|dence,
and by the Nature of the thing, <HI>being now
marry'd and &s;ettl'd in &s;o glorious a Manner,</HI> I &s;ay, I
had not only abandon'd all the gay and wicked
Cour&s;e which I had gone throrow before, but
I began to look back upon it with that Horror,
and that Dete&s;tation, which is the certain Com|panion,
if not the Forerunner, o$ Repentance.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Wonders of my pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances
wou'd work upon me, and I &s;hould have
&s;ome Raptures upon my Soul, upon the Subject of
my coming &s;o &s;moothly out of the Arms of Hell,
that I was not ingulph'd in Ruin, as mo&s;t who
lead &s;uch Lives are, fir&s;t or la&s;t; but this was a
<PB N="322" REF="327">
Flight too high for me; I was not come to that
Repentance that is rais'd from a Sence of Heaven's
Goodne&s;s; I repented of the Crime, but it was of
another and lower kind of Repentance, and ra|ther
mov'd by my Fears of Vengeance, than from
a Sen&s;e of being &s;par'd from being puni&s;h'd, and
landed &s;afe after a Storm.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing which, happen'd after our coming
to the <HI>Hague,</HI> (where we lodg'd For a-while) was,
that my Spou&s;e &s;aluted me one Morning with the
Title of <HI>Counte&s;s;</HI> as he &s;aid he intended to do, by
having the Inheritance to which the Honour was
annex'd, made over to him; it is true, it was a
Rever&s;ion, but it &s;oon fell, and in the mean time,
as all the Brothers of a <HI>Count</HI> are call'd <HI>Counts,</HI> &s;o I
had the Title by Courte&s;ie, about three Years be|fore
I had it in reality.</P>
<P>I was agreeably &s;urpriz'd at this coming, &s;o &s;oon,
and wou'd have had my Spou&s;e have taken the Mo|ney
which it co&s;t him, out of my Stock, but he
&s;augh'd at me, and went on.</P>
<P>I was now in the height of my Glory and Pro&s;|perity,
and I was call'd the <HI>Counte&s;s de</HI>&mdash;; for
I had obtain'd that unlook'd for, which I &s;ecretly
aim'd at, and was really the main Rea&s;on of my
coming Abroad: I took now more Servants; liv'd
in a kind of Magnificence that I had not been ac|quainted
with; was call'd <HI>Your Honour</HI> at every
word, and had a <HI>Coronet</HI> behind my Coach; tho'
at the &s;ame time I knew little or nothing of my
new Pedigree.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that my Spou&s;e took upon him
to manage, was to declare our&s;elves marry'd ele|ven
Years before our arriving in <HI>Holland;</HI> and
con&s;equently to acknowledge our little Son, who
was ye: in <HI>England,</HI> to be legitimate; order him
to be brought over, and added to his Family, and
acknowledge him to be our own.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="328">
This was done by giving Notice to his People at
<HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where his Children (which were two
Sons and a Daughter) were brought-up; that he
was come over from <HI>England;</HI> and that he was ar|riv'd
at the <HI>Hague,</HI> with his Wife, and &s;hou'd re|&s;ide
there &s;ome time; and chat he wou'd have his
two Sons brought down to &s;ee him, which ac|cordingly
was done, and where I entertain'd them
with all the Kindne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s that they
cou'd expect from their Mother-in-Law; and who
pretended to be &s;o ever &s;ince they were two or
three Years old.</P>
<P>This &s;uppo&s;ing as to have been &s;o long marry'd,
was not difficult at-all, in a Country where we had
been &s;een together about that time, <HI>viz.</HI> eleven
Years and a half before; and where we had never
been &s;een afterwards, till we now return'd together;
this being &s;een together, was al&s;o openly own'd,
and acknowledg'd of cour&s;e, by our Friend, the
Merchant at <HI>Rotterdam;</HI> and al&s;o by the People in
the Hou&s;e where we both lodg'd, in the &s;ame City,
and where our fir&s;t Intimacies began, and who, as
it happen'd, were all alive; and therefore to make
it the more publick, we made a Tour to <HI>Rotter|dam</HI>
again, lodg'd in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, and was vi|&s;ited
there by our Friend, the Merchant; and af|terwards
invited frequently to his Hou&s;e, where
he treated us very hand&s;omely.</P>
<P>This Conduct of my Spou&s;e, and which he
manag'd very cleverly, was indeed, a Te&s;timony
of a wonderful Degree of Hone&s;ty and Affection
to our little Son; for it was done purely for the
&s;ake of the Child.</P>
<P>I call it an hone&s;t Affection, becau&s;e it was from
a Principle of Hone&s;ty that he &s;o enrne&s;tly con|cern'd
him&s;elf, to prevent the Scandal which wou'd
otherwi&s;e have fallen upon the Child, <HI>who was it|&s;elf
<PB N="324" REF="329">
innocent;</HI> and as it was from this Principle of
Ju&s;tice that he &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ollicited me, and con|jur'd
me by the natural Affections of a Mother,
to marry him, when it was yet young within me,
and unborn, that the Child might not &s;uffer for
the Sin of its Father and Mother; &s;o tho' at the
&s;ame time, he really lov'd me very well, yet I had
rea&s;on to believe, that it was from this Principle
of Ju&s;tice to the Child, that, he came to <HI>England</HI>
again to &s;eek me, with de&s;ign to marry me, and,
<HI>as he call'd it,</HI> &s;ave the innocent Lamb from an In|famy
wor&s;e than Death.</P>
<P>It is with a ju&s;t Reproach to my&s;elf, that I mu&s;t
repeat it again, that I had not the &s;ame Concern for
it, tho' it was the Child of my own Body; nor
had I ever the hearty affectionate Love to the
Child, that he had; what the rea&s;on of it was, I
cannot tell; and indeed, I had &s;hown a general
Neglect of the Child, thro' all the gay Years of my
<HI>London</HI> Revels; except that I &s;ent <HI>Amy</HI> to look
upon it now and then, and to pay for its Nur&s;ing;
as for me, I &s;carce &s;aw it four times in the fir&s;t four
Years of its Life, and often wi&s;h'd it wou'd go
quietly out of the World; whereas a Son which
I had by the Jeweller, I took a different Care of,
and &s;hew'd a differing Concern for, tho' I did not
let him know me; for I provided very well for
him; had him put out very well to School; and
when he came to Years fit for it, let him go over
with, a Per&s;on of Hone&s;ty and good Bu&s;ine&s;s, to
the <HI>Indies;</HI> and after he had liv'd there &s;ome time,
and began to act for him&s;elf, &s;ent him over the
Value of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> at &s;everal times, with which he
traded, and grew rich; and, <HI>as 'tis to be hop'd,</HI> may
at la&s;t come over again with forty or fifty Thou|&s;and
Pounds in his Pocket, as many do who have
not &s;uch Encouragement at their Beginning.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="330">
I al&s;o &s;ent him over a Wife; a beautiful young
lady, well-bred, an exceeding good-natur'd plea|&s;ant
Creature; but the nice young Fellow did not
like her, and had the Impudence to write to me,
<HI>that is, to the Per&s;on I employ'd to corre&s;pond with him,</HI>
to &s;end him another; and promis'd, that he wou'd
marry her I had &s;ent him, to a Friend of his, who
lik'd her better than he did; but I took it &s;o ill,
that I wou'd not &s;end him another, and withal,
&s;topp'd another Article of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> which I had ap|pointed
to &s;end him: He con&s;ider'd of it af|terwards,
and offer'd to take her; but then truly
&s;he took &s;o ill the fir&s;t Affront he put upon her,
that &s;he wou'd not have him, and I &s;ent him word,
I thought &s;he was very much in the right: How|ever,
after courting her two Years, and &s;ome Friends
interpo&s;ing, &s;he took him, and made him an ex|cellent
Wi&s;e, as I knew &s;he wou'd; but I never
&s;ent him the thou&s;and Pound Cargo, &s;o that he
lo&s;t that Money for mi&s;u&s;ing me, and took the
Lady at la&s;t without it.</P>
<P>My new Spou&s;e and I, liv'd a very regular con|templative
Life, and in it&s;elf certainly a Life fill'd
with all humane Felicity: But if I look'd upon my
pre&s;ent Situation with Satisfaction, as I certainly
did, &s;o in Proportion I on all Occa&s;ions look'd
back on former things with Dete&s;tation, and with
the utmo&s;t Affection; and now indeed, and not
till now, tho&s;e Reflections began to prey upon my
Comforts, and le&s;&s;en the Sweets of my other En|joyments:
They might be &s;aid to have gnaw'd a
Hole in my Heart before; but now they made a
Hole quite thro' it; now they eat into all my
plea&s;ant things; made bitter every Sweet, and
mix'd my Sighs with every Smile.</P>
<P>Not all the Affluence or a plentiful Fortune;
not a hundred Thou&s;and Pounds E&s;tate; (for be|tween
<PB N="326" REF="331">
is we had little le&s;s) not Honour and Ti|tles,
Attendants and Equipages; <HI>in a word,</HI> not all
the things we call Plea&s;ure, cou'd give me any
reli&s;h, or &s;weeten the Ta&s;te of things to me; <HI>at
lea&s;t,</HI> not &s;o much, but I grew &s;ad heavy, pen|&s;ive,
and melancholly; &s;tept little, and eat little;
dream'd continually of the mo&s;t frightful and ter|rible
things imaginable: Nothing but Apparitions
of Devils and Mon&s;ters; falling into Gulphs, and
off from &s;teep and high Precipices, <HI>and the like;</HI>
&s;o that in the Morning, when I &s;hou'd ri&s;e, and
be refre&s;h'd with the Ble&s;&s;ing of Re&s;t, I was <HI>Hag|ridden</HI>
with Frights, and terrible things, form'd
meerly in the Imagination; and was either tir'd,
and wanted Sleep, or over-run with Vapours, and
not fit for conver&s;ing with my Family, or any-one
el&s;e.</P>
<P>My Husband, the tendere&s;t Creature in the
World, and particularly &s;o to me, was in great
Concern for me, and did every-thing that lay in
his Power, to comfort and re&s;tore me; &s;trove to
rea&s;on me out of it; then tried all the Ways po&s;&s;i|ble
to divert me; but it was all to no purpo&s;e, or
to but very little.</P>
<P>My only Relief was, &s;ometimes to unbo&s;om
my&s;elf to poor <HI>Amy,</HI> when &s;he and I was alone;
and &s;he did all &s;he cou'd to comfort me, but all
was to little Effect there; for tho' <HI>Amy</HI> was the
better Penitent before, when we had been in the
Storm; <HI>Amy</HI> was ju&s;t where &s;he us'd to be, <HI>now,</HI> a
wild, gay, loo&s;e Wretch, and not much the graver
for her Age; for <HI>Amy</HI> was between forty and fifty
by this time too.</P>
<P>But to go on with my own Story; as I had no
Comforter, &s;o I had no Coun&s;ellor; it was well,
<HI>as I often thought,</HI> that I was not a <HI>Roman-Catholick;</HI>
for what a piece of Work &s;hou'd I have made, to
<PB N="327" REF="332">
have gone to a Prie&s;t with &s;uch a Hi&s;tory as I
had to tell him? and what Pennance wou'd any
<HI>Father-Confe&s;&s;or</HI> have oblig'd me to perform? e&s;peci|ally
if he had been hone&s;t and true to his Office.</P>
<P>However, as I had none of the recour&s;e, &s;o I
had none of the Ab&s;olution, by which the Crimi|nal
confe&s;&s;ing, goes away comforted; but I went
about with a Heart loaded with Crime, and alto|gether
in the dark, as to what I was to do; and in
this Condition I langui&s;h'd near two Years; I may
well call it langui&s;hing, for if Providence had not
reliev'd me, I &s;hou'd have died in little time: <HI>But
of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t now go back to another Scene, and join
it to this End of my Story, which will compleat
all my Concern with <HI>England, at lea&s;t,</HI> all that I
&s;hall bring into this Account. I have hinted at
large, what I had done for my two Sons, one at
<HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and the other in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>But I have not gone thorow the Story of my two
Daughters: I was &s;o in danger of being known by
one of them, that I dur&s;t not &s;ee her, &s;o as to let
her know who I was; and for the other, I cou'd
not well know how to &s;ee her, and own her, and
let her &s;ee me, becau&s;e &s;he mu&s;t then know that
I wou'd not let her Si&s;ter know me, which wou'd
look &s;trange; &s;o that upon the whole, I re&s;olv'd
to &s;ee neither of them at-all, but <HI>Amy</HI> manag'd all
that for me; and when &s;he had made Gentlewo|men
of them both, by giving them a good tho'
late Education, &s;he had like to have blown up the
whole Ca&s;e, and her&s;elf and me too, by an unhap|py
Di&s;covery of her&s;elf to the la&s;t of them, <HI>that is,</HI>
to her who was our Cookmaid, and who, <HI>as I &s;aid
before, Amy</HI> had been oblig'd to turn away, for
fear of the very Di&s;covery which now happen'd:
I have ob&s;erv'd already in what Manner <HI>Amy</HI> ma|nag'd
<PB N="328" REF="333">
her by a third Per&s;on; and how the Girl,
when &s;he was &s;et up for a Lady, <HI>as above,</HI> came and
vi&s;ited <HI>Amy</HI> at my Lodgings; after which, <HI>Amy</HI>
going, as was her Cu&s;tom, to &s;ee the Girl's Bro|ther,
(my Son) at the hone&s;t Man's Hou&s;e in <HI>Spit|tle-Fields;</HI>
both the Girls were there, meerly by ac|cident,
at the &s;ame time, and the other Girl una|wares
di&s;cover'd the Secret; <HI>namely,</HI> that this was
the Lady that had done all this for them.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was greatly &s;urpriz'd at if, but as &s;he &s;aw
there was no Remedy, &s;he made a Je&s;t of it; and &s;o
after that, convers'd openly, being &s;till &s;atisfied
that neither of them cou'd make much of it, as
long a they knew nothing of me: So &s;he took
them together one time, and told them the Hi|&s;tory,
<HI>as &s;he call'd it, of their Mother;</HI> beginning
at the mi&s;erable carrying them to their Aunt's
&s;he own'd &s;he was not their Mother, her&s;elf, but
de&s;crib'd her to them: However, when &s;he &s;aid &s;he
was not their Mother, one of them expre&s;s'd her&s;elf
very much &s;urpriz'd, for the Girl had taken up a
&s;trong Fancy that <HI>Amy</HI> was really her Mother;
and that &s;he had for &s;ome particular Rea&s;ons, con|ceal'd
it from her; and therefore when &s;he told her
frankly that &s;he was not her Mother, the Girl fell
a-crying, and <HI>Amy</HI> had much ado to keep Life in
her: This was the Girl who was at fir&s;t my Cook|maid
in the <HI>Pallmall;</HI> when <HI>Amy</HI> had brought her
to again a little, and &s;he had recover'd her fir&s;t Di&s;|order,
<HI>Amy</HI> ask'd what ail'd her? the poor Girl
hung about her, and ki&s;s'd her, and was in &s;uch
a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;till, tho' &s;he was a great Wench of
Nineteen or Twenty Years old, that &s;he cou'd
not be brought to &s;peak a great-while; at la&s;t, ha|ving
recover'd her Speech, &s;he &s;aid &s;till, <HI>But O do
not &s;ay you a'n't my Mother! I'm &s;ure you are my
Mother;</HI> and then the Girl cry'd again like to kill
<PB N="329" REF="334">
her&s;elf; <HI>Amy</HI> cou'd not tell what to do with her a
good-while; &s;he was loth to &s;ay again, <HI>&s;he was not
her Mother,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he wou'd not throw her into
a Fit of crying again; but &s;he went round about
little with her: Why Child, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> why wou'd
you have me be your Mother? If it be becau&s;e I
am &s;o kind to you, be ea&s;ie, my Dear, &s;ays <HI>Amy,</HI>
I'll be as kind to you &s;till, as if I was your Mother.</P>
<P>Ay but, <HI>&s;ays the Girl,</HI> I am &s;ure you are my Mo|ther
too; and what have I done that you won't
own me, and that you will not be call'd my Mo|ther?
tho' I am poor, you have made me a Gen|tlewoman,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> and I won't do any-thing to
di&s;grace you; be&s;ides, <HI>adds &s;he,</HI> I can keep a Secret
too, e&s;pecially for my own Mother, &s;ure; then
&s;he calls <HI>Amy</HI> her <HI>Dear Mother,</HI> and hung about
her Neck again, crying &s;till vehemently.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Part of the Girl's Words alam'd <HI>Amy,</HI>
and, <HI>as &s;he told me,</HI> frighted her terribly; nay, &s;he
was &s;o confounded with, it, that &s;he was not able to
govern her&s;elf, or to conceal her Di&s;order from the
Girl her&s;elf, <HI>as you &s;hall hear: Amy</HI> was at a full Stop,
and confus'd to the la&s;t Degree; and the Girl a
&s;harp Jade, turn'd it upon her: My dear Mother,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> do not be unea&s;ie about it; I know it all;
but do not be unen&s;ie, I won't let my Si&s;ter know
a word of it, or my Brother either, without you
give me leave; but don't di&s;own me now you
have found me; don't hide your&s;elf from me any
longer; I can't bear that, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> it will break my
Heart.</P>
<P>I think the Girl's mad, <HI>&s;ays Amy;</HI> why Child,
I tell thee, if I was thy Mother I wou'd not di&s;|own
thee; don't you &s;ee I am as kind to you as if
I was your Mother? <HI>Amy</HI> might as well have &s;ung
a Song to a Kettle-Drum, as talk to her: Yes, <HI>&s;ays
the Girl,</HI> you are very good to me indeed; and
<PB N="330" REF="335">
that was enough, to make any-body believe &s;he
was her Mother too; but however, that was not
the Ca&s;e, &s;he had other Rea&s;ons to believe, and
to know that &s;he was her Mother; and it was a &s;ad
thing &s;he wou'd not let her call her Mother, who
was her own Child.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was &s;o Heart-full with the Di&s;turbance of
it, that &s;he did not enter farther with her into the
Enquiry, as &s;he wou'd otherwi&s;e have done; I mean,
as to what made the Girl &s;o po&s;itive, but
comes away, and tells me the whole Story.</P>
<P>I was Thunder-&s;truck with the Story at fir&s;t,
and much more afterwards, <HI>as you &s;hall hear;</HI> but,
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I was Thunder-&s;truck at fir&s;t, and amaz'd,
and &s;aid to <HI>Amy,</HI> There mu&s;t be &s;omething or o|ther
in it more than we know of; but having exa|min'd
farther into it, I found the Girl had no No|tion
of any-body, but of <HI>Amy;</HI> and glad I was
that I was not concern'd in the Pretence, and that
the Girl had no Notion of me in it: But even this
Ea&s;ine&s;s did not continue long, for the next time
<HI>Amy</HI> went to &s;ee her, &s;he was the &s;ame thing, and
rather more violent with <HI>Amy</HI> than &s;he was before:
<HI>Amy</HI> endeavour'd to pacifie her by all the Ways
imaginable; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> &s;he told her, &s;he took it ill that
&s;he wou'd not believe her; <HI>and told her,</HI> if &s;he
wou'd not give over &s;uch a fooli&s;h Whim&s;ie, &s;he
wou'd leave her to the wide World, as &s;he found
her.</P>
<P>This put the Girl into Fits, and &s;he cry'd ready
to kill her&s;elf and hung about <HI>Amy</HI> again, like a
Child; Why, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> why can yon not be ea&s;ie
with me then, and compo&s;e your&s;elf, and let me
go on to do you good, and &s;how you Kindne&s;s,
as I wou'd do, and as I intend to do? Can you
think that if I was your Mother, I would not tell
you &s;o? What Whim&s;ie is this that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es your
<PB N="331" REF="336">
Mind? <HI>&s;ays Amy:</HI> Well, the Girl told her in a few
Words, but tho&s;e few &s;uch as frighted <HI>Amy</HI> out of
her Wits, land me too; That &s;he knew well enough
how it was; I know, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> when you left&mdash;,
<HI>naming the Village,</HI> where I liv'd when my Father
went away from us all, that you went over to
<HI>France,</HI> I know that too, and who you went with,
<HI>&s;ays the Girl;</HI> did not my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> come back
again with you? I know it all well enough, tho'
I was but a Child, I have heard it all.&mdash;And thus
&s;he run on with &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e, as put <HI>Amy</HI> out
of all Temper again; and &s;he rav'd at her like
a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and <HI>told her,</HI> &s;he wou'd never come
near her any more; &s;he might go a-begging again
if &s;he wou'd; &s;he'd have nothing to do with her:
The Girl, a pa&s;&s;ionate Wench, <HI>told her,</HI> &s;he knew
the wor&s;t of it, &s;he cou'd go to Service again, and
if &s;he wou'd not own her own Child, &s;he mu&s;t do
as &s;he pleas'd then &s;he fell into a Pa&s;&s;ion or crying
again, as if &s;he wou'd kill her&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>In &s;hort,</HI> this Girl's Conduct terrify'd <HI>Amy</HI> to the
la&s;t Degree, and me too, and was it not that we
knew the Girl was quite wrong in &s;ome things,
&s;he was yet &s;o right in &s;ome other, that it gave me
a great-deal of Perplexity; but that which put
<HI>Amy</HI> the mo&s;t to it, was, that the Girl <HI>(my Daugh|ter)</HI>
told her, that &s;he (<HI>meaning me her Mother</HI>) had
gone away with the <HI>Jeweller,</HI> and into <HI>France</HI> too;
&s;he did not call him <HI>the Jeweller,</HI> but with the
Landlord of the Hou&s;e; who, after her Mother
fell into Di&s;tre&s;s, and that <HI>Amy</HI> had taken all the
Children from her, made much of her, and after|wards
marry'd her.</P>
<P><HI>In &s;hort,</HI> it was plain the Girl had but a broken
Account of things, but yet, that &s;he had receiv'd
&s;ome Accounts that had a reallity in the Bottom of
them, &s;o that it &s;eems our fir&s;t Mea&s;ures, and the

the Children to, and &s;he made &s;ome Bu&s;tle it &s;eems,
about it; but as good-luck was, it was too late,
and I was remov'd, and gone, none knew whither;

<P>This we pick'd out of the Girl's Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>that

of broken Fragments of Stories, &s;uch as the
Girl her&s;elf had heard &s;o long ago, that &s;he her&s;elf
cou'd make very little of it; only that in the main,
that her Mother had play'd the Whore; had gone
away with the Gentleman that was Landlord of
the Hou&s;e; that he married her; that &s;he went
into <HI>France;</HI> and as &s;he had learn'd in my Family,
where &s;he was a Servant, that Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> and her
Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> had been in <HI>France</HI> together; &s;o &s;he
put all the&s;e things together, and joining them
with the great Kindne&s;s that <HI>Amy</HI> now &s;hew'd
her, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Creature that Amy was really
her Mother; nor was it po&s;&s;ible for Amy to con|quer
it for a long time.</P>
<P>But this, after I had &s;earch'd into it as far as
by <HI>Amy</HI>'s relation I cou'd get an Account of it,
did not di&s;quiet me half &s;o much, as that the
young Slut had got the Name of <HI>Roxana</HI> by the
end; and that &s;he knew who her Lady <HI>Roxana</HI>
was, <HI>and the like;</HI> tho' this neither, did not hang
together, for then &s;he wou'd not have fix'd upon
<HI>Amy</HI> for her Mother: But &s;ome time after, when
<HI>Amy</HI> had almo&s;t per&s;waded her our of it, and that
the Girl began to be &s;o confounded in her Di&s;|cour&s;es
of it, that they made neither Head nor
Tail; at la&s;t, the pa&s;&s;ionate Creature flew out
in a kind of Rage, <HI>and &s;aid to</HI> Amy, That
<PB N="333" REF="338">
if &s;he was not her Mother, Madam <HI>Roxana</HI> was
her Mother; then, for one of them, <HI>&s;he was &s;ure,</HI>
was her Mother; and then all this that <HI>Amy</HI> had
done for her, was by Madam <HI>Roxana's,</HI> Order;
and I am &s;ure, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> it was my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI>'s
Coach that brought the Gentlewoman (whoever
it was) to my Uncle's in <HI>Spittle-Fields;</HI> for the
Coachman told me &s;ob: <HI>Amy</HI> fell a- laughing at her
aloud, <HI>as was her u&s;ual way;</HI> but as <HI>Amy</HI> told me,
it was but on one &s;ide of her Mouth; for &s;he was
&s;o confounded at her Di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;he was ready
to &s;ink into the Ground; and &s;o was I too, when
&s;he told it me.</P>
<P>However, <HI>Amy</HI> brazen'd her out of it all; <HI>told
her,</HI> Well, &s;ince you think you are &s;o high-born,
as to be my Lady <HI>Roxana</HI>'s Daughter, you may
go to her and claim your Kindred, can't you? I
&s;uppo&s;e, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> you know where to find her?
<HI>She &s;aid,</HI> &s;he did not que&s;tion to find her, for &s;he
knew Where &s;he was gone to live privately; but
tho' &s;he might be remov'd again, for I know how
it is, &s;ays &s;he, with a kind of a Smile, or a Grin;
I know how it all is, well enough.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was &s;o provok'd, that &s;he told me, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI>
&s;he began to think it wou'd be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
to murther her: That Expre&s;&s;ion fill'd me with
Horror; all my Blood ran chill in my Veins, and
a Fit of trembling &s;eiz'd me, that I cou'd not
&s;peak a good-while; at la&s;t, What is the Devil
in you, <HI>Amy, &s;aid I?</HI> Nay, nay, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> let it be
the Devil, or not the Devil, it I thought he knew
one tittle of your Hi&s;tory, I wou'd di&s;patch her
if &s;he were my own Daughter a thou&s;and times;
and I <HI>&s;ays I in a Rage,</HI> as well as I love you, wou'd
be the fir&s;t that &s;hou'd put the Halter about your
Neck, and &s;ee you hang$d, with more Satisfaction
than ever I &s;aw you in my Life; nay, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you
<PB N="334" REF="339">
wou'd not live to be hang'd, <HI>I believe,</HI> I &s;hou'd cut
your Throat with my own Hand; I am almo&s;t rea|dy
to do it, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> as 'tis, for your but naming
the thing; with that, I call'd her cur&s;ed Devil,
and bade her get one of the Room.</P>
<P>I think it was the fir&s;t time that ever I was an|gry
with <HI>Amy</HI> in all my Life; and when all was
done, tho' &s;he was a devili&s;h Jade in having &s;uch
a Thought, yet in was all of it the Effect of her
Exce&s;s of Affection and Fidelity to me.</P>
<P>But this thing gave me a terrible Shock, for it
happn'd ju&s;t after I was marry'd, and &s;erv'd to
ha&s;ten my going over to <HI>Holland;</HI> for I wou'd not
have been &s;een, to as to be known by the Name of
<HI>Roxana,</HI> no, not for ten Thou&s;and Pounds; it
wou'd have been enough to have ruin'd me to all
Intents and Purpo&s;es with my Husband, and every|body
el&s;e too; I might: as well have been the <HI>Ger|man
Prince&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Well, I &s;et <HI>Amy</HI> to-work, and give <HI>Amy</HI> her
due, &s;he &s;et all her Wits to-work, to find out
which way this Girl had her Knowledge but
more particularly, how much Knowledge &s;he had,
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> what &s;he really knew, and what &s;he
did not know; for this was the main thing with
me how he cou'd &s;ay &s;he knew who Madam
<HI>Roxana</HI> was, and what notions &s;he had of that
Affair was very my&s;terious to me; &s;or 'twas cer|tain
&s;he cou'd not have a right Notion of me, be|cau&s;e
&s;he wou'd have it be, that <HI>Amy</HI> was her Mo|ther.</P>
<P>I &s;colded hearity at <HI>Amy,</HI> for letting the Girl
ever know her, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> know her in this Af|fair
for that &s;he knew her, cou'd not be hid, be|cau&s;e
&s;he, <HI>as I might &s;ay,</HI> &s;erv'd <HI>Amy,</HI> or rather
under <HI>Amy,</HI> in my Family, <HI>as is &s;aid before;</HI> but
&s;he <HI>(Amy)</HI> talk'd with her at fir&s;t by another Per|&s;on,
<PB N="335" REF="340">
and not by her&s;elf; and than Secret came out
by an Accident, <HI>as I have &s;aid above.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was concern'd at it as well as I, but cou'd
not help it; and tho' it gave us great Unea&s;ine&s;s,
yet us there was no Remedy, we were bound to
make as little Noi&s;e of in as we cou'd, that it
might go no farther: I bade <HI>Amy</HI> puni&s;h the Girl
for it, <HI>and &s;he did &s;o,</HI> for &s;he parted with her in a
Huff, <HI>and told her,</HI> &s;he &s;hou'd &s;ee, &s;he was not her
Mother, for that &s;he cou'd leave her ju&s;t where &s;he
found her; and &s;eeing &s;he cou'd not be content to
be &s;ervd by the Kindne&s;s of a Friend, but that &s;he
wou'd needs make a Mother of her, &s;he wou'd
for the future, be neither Mother or Friend; and
to bid her go to Service again, and be a Drudge,
as &s;he was before.</P>
<P>The poor Girl cry'd mo&s;t lamentably, but wou'd
not be beaten out of it &s;till; but that which dum|tounded
<HI>Amy</HI> more than all the re&s;t, was, that
when &s;he had rated the poor Girl a long time,
and cou'd not beat her out of it, and had, <HI>as I
have ob&s;erv'd,</HI> threaten'd to leave her; the Girl
kept to what &s;he &s;aid before, and put this Turn to
it again; that &s;he was &s;ure, it Amy wa'n't, my
Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was, her Mother; and that &s;he
wou'd go find her out; <HI>adding,</HI> that &s;he made no
doubt but &s;he cou'd do it, for &s;he knew where to
enquire the Name or her new Husband.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> came home with this Piece of News in her
Mouth, to me; I cou'd ea&s;ily perceive when &s;he
came in that &s;he was mad in her Mind, and in a
Rage at &s;omething or other, and was in great Pain
to get it out; for when &s;he came fir&s;t in, my Hu&s;|band
was in the Room; however, <HI>Amy</HI> going up
to undre&s;s her, I &s;oon made an Excu&s;e to follow
her, and coming into the Room; What the D&mdash;I
is the Manner, <HI>Amy</HI> &s;ays, I&punc; am &s;ure you have
<PB N="336" REF="341">
&s;ome bad News: News, <HI>&s;ays Amy, aloud,</HI> ay, &s;o I
have; I think the D&mdash;I is in that young Wench,
&s;he'll ruin us all, and her&s;elf too, there's no quiet|ing
her: So &s;he went on, and told me all the Par|ticulars;
but &s;ure nothing was &s;o a&s;toni&s;h'd as I
was when &s;he told me that the Girl knew I was
marry'd; that &s;he knew my Husband's Name,
and wou'd endeavour to find me out; I thought
I &s;hould have &s;unk down at the very Words; in
the middle of all my Amazement, <HI>Amy</HI> &s;tarts up,
and runs about the Room like a di&s;tracted body;
I'll, put an End to it, that I will; I can't bear it;
I mu&s;t murther her; I'll kill her B&mdash;, <HI>and
&s;wears by her Maker, in the mo&s;t &s;erious Tone in the
World;</HI> and then repeated it over three or four
times, walking to-and-again in the Room; I will,
<HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I will kill her, if there was, not another
Wench, in the World.</P>
<P>Prethee hold thy Tongue, <HI>Amy, &s;ays I,</HI> why
thou art mad; ay, &s;o I am, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> &s;tark-mad,
but I'll be the Death of her for-all that, and then
I &s;hall be &s;ober again: But you &s;han't, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI>
you &s;han't hurt a Hair of her Head; why you
ought to be hang'd for what you have done al|ready;
for having re&s;olv'd on it, is doing it,
as to the Guilt of the Fact; you are Murthe|rer
already, as much as it you had done it al|ready.</P>
<P>I know that, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> and it can be no wor&s;e;
I'll put you out of your Pain, and her too; &s;he
&s;hall never challenge you for her Mother in this
World, whatever &s;he may in; the next: Well
well, &s;ays I, be quiet, ant do not talk thus, I
can't bear it; &s;o &s;he grew a little &s;oberer after a|while.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, the Notion of being di&s;|cover'd, carried
with it &s;o many frightful <HI>Ideas,</HI>
<PB N="337" REF="342">
and hurry'd my Thoughts &s;o much, that I was
&s;carce my&s;elf, any more than <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;o dreadful a
thing is a Load of Guilt upon the Mind.</P>
<P>And yet when <HI>Amy</HI> began the &s;econd time, to
talk thus abominably of killing the poor Child,
of murthering her, and &s;wore by her Maker that
&s;he wou'd, &s;o that I began to &s;ee that &s;he was
in earne&s;t, I was farther terrified a great deal, and
it help'd to bring me to my&s;elf again in other
Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>We laid our Heads together then, to &s;ee if it
was po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover by what means &s;he had
learn'd to talk &s;o, and how &s;he (<HI>I mean my Girl</HI>)
came to know that her Mother had marry'd a
Husband; but it wou'd not do, the Girl wou'd
acknowlege nothing, and gave but a very imperfect
Account of things &s;till, being di&s;gu&s;ted to the la&s;t
Degree with <HI>Amy</HI>'s leaving her &s;o abruptly as
&s;he did.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Amy</HI> went to the Hou&s;e where the Boy was,
but it was all one; there they had only heard a
confus'd Story of the <HI>&s;omebody,</HI> they knew not
who, which this &s;ame Wench had told them, but
they gave no heed to it at-all: <HI>Amy</HI> told them
how fooli&s;hly the Girl had acted; and how &s;he
had carry'd on the Whim&s;ie &s;o far, in &s;pight of
all they cou'd &s;ay to her; that &s;he had taken it to
ill, &s;he wou'd &s;ee her no more, and &s;o &s;he might
e'en go to Service again if &s;he wou'd, for &s;he <HI>(Amy)</HI>
wou'd have nothing to do with her, unle&s;s &s;he
humbled her&s;elf, and chang'd her Note, and that
quickly too.</P>
<P>The good old Gentleman who had been the Be|nefactor
to them all, was greatly concern'd at it,
and the good Woman his Wife was griev'd be|yond
all expre&s;&s;ing, and begg'd her Lady&s;hip, <HI>mean|ing
Amy,</HI> not to re&s;ent it, they promis'd too, they
<PB N="338" REF="343">
would talk with her about it; and the old Gentle-woman
added, <HI>with &s;ame A&s;toni&s;hment,</HI> Sure &s;he can|not
be &s;uch a Fool but &s;he will be prevail'd with
to hold her Tongue, when &s;he has it from your
own Mouth, that you are not her Mother, and &s;ees
that it di&s;obliges your Lady&s;hip to have her in&s;i&s;t
upon it and &s;o <HI>Amy</HI> came away, with &s;ome Ex|pectation
that it wou'd be &s;topp'd here.</P>
<P>But the Girl was &s;uch a Fool for-all that, and
per&s;i&s;ted in it ob&s;tinately, notwith&s;tanding all they
cou'd &s;ay to her; nay, her Si&s;ter begg'd and in|treated
her not to play the Fool, for that it wou'd
ruin her too; and that the Lady (<HI>meaning Amy</HI>)
wou'd abandon them both.</P>
<P>Well, notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI>
upon it, and which was wor&s;e, the longer it la&s;ted,
the more &s;he began to drop <HI>Amy</HI>'s Lady&s;hip, and
wou'd have it, that the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was her Mo|ther
and that &s;he had made &s;ome Enquiries about
it, and did not doubt but &s;he &s;hou'd find her out.</P>
<P>When it was come to this, and we found there
was nothing to be done with the Girl, but that &s;he
was &s;o ob&s;tinately bent upon the Search after me,
that &s;he ventur'd to forfeit all &s;he had in view;
<HI>I &s;ay</HI> when I found it was come to this, I began
to be more &s;erious in my Preparations of my going
beyond-Sea; and particularly, it gave me &s;ome rea|&s;on
to fear that there was &s;omething in it; but the
following Accident put me be&s;ide all my Mea&s;ures,
and &s;truck me into the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion that ever
I was in, in my Life.</P>
<P>I was &s;o near going Abroad, that my Spou&s;e and
I had taken Mea&s;ures for our going-off; and be|cau&s;e
I wou'd be &s;ure not to go too publick, but
&s;o as to take away all Po&s;&s;ibility of being &s;een, I
had made &s;ome Exception to my Spou&s;e again&s;t
going in the ordinary publick Pa&s;&s;age-Boats; my
<PB N="339" REF="344">
Pretence to him, was the promi&s;ouous Crowds in
tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els; want of Convenience, <HI>and the like;</HI>
&s;o he took the Hint, And found me out an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Merchant-Ship, which was bound for <HI>Rotterdam,</HI>
and getting &s;oon acquainted with the Ma&s;ter, he
hir'd his whole Ship, <HI>that is &s;o &s;ay,</HI> his Great-Cab|bin,
for I do not mean his Ship for Freight; that
&s;o we had all the Conveniences po&s;&s;ible, for our
Pa&s;&s;age; and all things being near ready, he brought
home the Captain one Day to Dinner with him,
that I might &s;ee him, and be acquainted a little
with him; &s;o we came, after Dinner, to talk of
the Ship, and the Conveniences on-board, and the
Captain pre&s;s'd me earne&s;tly to come on-board,
and &s;ee the Ship, intimating, That he wou'd
treat us as well as he cou'd; and in Di&s;cour&s;e I
happen'd to &s;ay, I hop'd he had no other Pa&s;&s;en|gers;
<HI>he &s;aid,</HI> No, he had not; but, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> his
Wife had courted him a good-while to let her go
over to <HI>Holland</HI> with him, for he always us'd that
Trade, but he never cou'd think of venturing all
he had in one Bottom; but if I went with him, he
thought to take her and her Kin&s;woman along with
him this Voyage, that they might both wait upon
me; <HI>and &s;o added,</HI> that if we wou'd do him the
Honour to Dine on-board the next Day, he wou'd
bring his Wife on-board, the better to make us
welcome.</P>
<P>Who now cou'd have believ'd the Devil had
any Snare at the Bottom of all this? or that I
was in any Danger on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, &s;o remore
and out of the way as this was? But the Event
was the odde&s;t that cou'd be thought of: As it
happen'd, <HI>Amy</HI> was not at-home when we accepted
this Invitation, and &s;o &s;he was left out of the
Company; but in&s;tead of <HI>Amy,</HI> we took our ho|ne&s;t,
good-humour'd, never-to-be-omitted Friend
<PB N="340" REF="345">
the QU$KER, one of the be&s;t Creatures <HI>that
ever liv'd,</HI> &s;ure; and who, be&s;ides a thou&s;and good
Qualities unmix'd with one bad one, was parti|cularly
Excellent for being the be&s;t Company in
The World; tho' I think I had carry'd <HI>Amy</HI> too,
If &s;he had not been engag'd in this unhappy Girl's
Affair; for on a &s;udden the Girl was lo&s;t, and no
News was to be heard of her, and <HI>Amy</HI> had hunt|ed
her to every Place &s;he cou'd think of, that it was
likely to find her in, but all the News &s;he cou'd hear
of her, was, That &s;he eas gone to an old Come|rade's
Hou&s;e of hers, which &s;he call'd Si&s;ter, and
who was marry'd to a Ma&s;ter of a Ship who liv'd
At <HI>Redriff,</HI> and even this the Jade never told me:
It &s;eems when this Girl was directed by Amy to
get her &s;ome Br'ceding, go to the Boarding-School,
<HI>and the like,</HI> &s;he was recommended to a Boarding-School at <HI>Camberwell,</HI> and there &s;he contracted an
Acquaintance with a young Lady <HI>(&s;o they are all
Call'd)</HI> her Bedfellow, that they call'd Si&s;ters, and
promis'd never to break off their Acquaintaince.</P>
<P>But judge you what an unaccountable Surprized
mu&s;t be in, when I came on-board the Ship, and
was brought into the Captain's Cabbin, or, <HI>what
they call it,</HI> the Great-Cabbin of the Ship, to &s;ee
his Lady or Wife, and another young Per&s;on with
her, who, when I came to &s;ee her near-hand, was
my old Cook-Maid in the Pall$all, and as appear'd
by the Sequel of the Story, was neither more or
le&s;s, than my own Daughter; that I knew her, was
out of Doubt; $word$ tho' &s;he had not had Oppor|tunity
to &s;ee me very often, yet I had often &s;een
her, <HI>as I mu&s;t needs,</HI> being in my own Fa$$ly to
long.</P>
<P>If $ver I had need of Courage, and a &s;aid $word$
&s;ence of Mind, it was now; it was the only val$|le
Secret in the World to me; all depended upon
<PB N="341" REF="346">
this Occa&s;ion; it the Girl knew me, I was un|done;
and to di&s;cover any Suprize or Di&s;order,
had been to make her know me, or gue&s;s it, and
di&s;cover her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was once going to &s;eign a &s;wooning, and $aint|away,
and &s;o falling on the Ground, or Floor, put
them all into a Hurry and Fright, and by that
means get an Opportunity to be continually hold|ing
&s;omething to my No&s;e to &s;mell to, and &s;o hold
my Hand, or my Handkerchief, or both, before
my Mouth; then pretend I cou'd not bear the
Smell of the Ship, or the clo&s;ene&s;s of the Cabbin;
but that wou'd have been only to remove into a
clearer Air upon the Quarter-Deck, where we &s;hou'd
with it, have had a clearer Light too; and if I had
pretended the Smell of the Ship, it wou'd have
&s;erv'd only to have carry'd us all on-Shoar, to the
Captain's Hou&s;e, which was hard-by; for the Ship
lay &s;o clo&s;e to the Shore, that we only walk'd
over a Plank to go on-board, and over another
Ship which lay within her; &s;o this not appearing
$ea&s;ible, and the Thought not being two Minutes
old, there was no time, for the two Ladies ri&s;e up,
and we &s;aluted, &s;o that I was bound to come &s;o
near <HI>my Girl,</HI> as to ki&s;s her, which I wou'd not
have done, had it been po&s;&s;ible to Have avoided
$t;but there was no room to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I cannot but take Notice here, that notwith|&s;tanding
there was a &s;ecret Horror upon my Mind,
and I was ready to &s;ink when I came clo&s;e to her,
to &s;alute her; yet it was a &s;ecret inconceivable Plea|sure
to me when I ki&s;s'd her, to know that I ki&s;s'd
my own Child; my own Fle&s;h and Blood, born of
my Body; and who I had never ki&s;s'd &s;ince I took
the $atal Farewel of them all, with a Million or
Tears, and a Heart almo&s;t dead with Grief, when
<HI>Amy</HI> and the Good Woman took them all away,
<PB N="342" REF="347">
and went with them to <HI>Spittle-Fields:</HI> No Pen can
de&s;cribe, no Words can expre&s;s, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> the &s;trange
Impre&s;&s;ion which this thing made upon my Spi|rits;
I felt &s;omething &s;hoot thro' my Blood; my
Heart flutter'd; my Head fla&s;h'd, and was dizzy,
and ail within me, <HI>as I thought,</HI> turn'd about, and
much, ado I had, not to abandon my&s;elf to an Exce&s;s
of Pa&s;&s;ion at the fir&s;t Sight of her, much more
when my Lips touch'd her Face; I thought I mu&s;t
have taken her in my Arms, and ki&s;s'd her again
a thou&s;and times, whether I wou'd or no.</P>
<P>But I rous'd up my Judgment, and &s;hook it off,
And with infinite Unea&s;ine&s;s in my Mind, I &s;at
down: You will not wonder, if upon this Sur|prize
I was not conver&s;ible for &s;ome Minutes, and
that the Di&s;order had almo&s;t di&s;cover'd it&s;elf; I
had a Complication or &s;evere things upon me;
I cou'd not conceal my Di&s;order without the ut|mo&s;t
Difficulty; and yet upon my concealing it,
depended the whole of my Pro&s;perity; &s;o I us'd
all manner of Violence with my&s;elf, to prevent
the Mi&s;chief which was at the Door.</P>
<P>Well, I &s;aluted her; but as I went fir&s;t forward
to the Captain's Lady, who was at the farther-end
of the Cabbin, towards the Light, I had the Oc|ca&s;ion
offer'd, to &s;tand with my Back to the Light,
when I turn'd about to her, who &s;tood more on
my Left-hand, &s;o that &s;he had not a fair Sight
of me, tho' I was &s;o near her; I trembled, and
knew neither what I did, or &s;aid; I was in the
utmo&s;t Extremity, between &s;o many particular
Circumstances as lay upon me; for I was to con|ceal
my Di&s;order from every-body, at the ut|mo&s;t
Peril, and at the &s;ame time expected every|body
wou'd di&s;cern it; I was to expect &s;he wou'd
di&s;cover that &s;he knew me, and yet was, by all means
po&s;&s;ible, to prevent it; I was to conceal my&s;elf, if
<PB N="343" REF="348">
po&s;&s;ible, and yet had not the lea&s;t room to do
any-thing towards it; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> there was no re|treat;
no &s;hifting any-thing off; no avoiding or
preventing her having a full Sight of me; nor was
there any counterfeiting my Voice, for then my Hus|band
wou'd have perceiv'd it; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> there was not
the lea&s;t Circum&s;tance that offer'd me any A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
or any favourable thing to help me in this
Exigence.</P>
<P>After I had been upon the Rack for near half
an Hour, during which, I appear'd &s;tiff and re&s;erv'd,
and a little too formal; my Spou&s;e and the Cap|tain
fell into Di&s;cour&s;es about the Ship, and the
Sea, and Bu&s;ine&s;s remote from us Women, and
by-and-by the Captain carry'd him out upon the
Quarter-Deck, and left us all by our&s;elves, in
the Great-Cabbin: Then we began to be a lit|tle
freer one with another, and I began to be a lit|tle
reviv'd, by a &s;udden Fancy of my own, <HI>namely,</HI>
I thought I perceiv'd that the Girl did not know
me; and the chief Rea&s;on of my having &s;uch a
Notion, was, becau&s;e I did not perceive the lea&s;t
Di&s;order in her Countenance, or the lea&s;t Change
in her Carriage; no Confu&s;ion, no He&s;itation in
her Di&s;cour&s;e; <HI>nor,</HI> which had my Eye particu|larly
upon, did I ob&s;erve that &s;he fix'd her Eyes
much upon me, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> not &s;ingling me out
to look &s;teddily at me, as I thought wou'd have
been the Ca&s;e; but that &s;he rather &s;ingl'd out my
Friend the QUAKER, and chatted with her on
&s;everal things; but I ob&s;erv'd too, that it was all
about indifferent Matters.</P>
<P>This greatly encourag'd me, and I began to be a
little chearful; but I was knock'd down again as
with a Thunder-Clap, when turning to the Cap|tain's
Wife, and di&s;cour&s;ing of me, <HI>&s;he &s;aid to her,</HI>
Si&s;ter, I cannot but think <HI>(my Lady)</HI> to be very
<PB N="344" REF="349">
much like &s;uch a Per&s;on, <HI>then &s;he nam'd the Per|&s;on</HI>
and the Captains Wife &s;aid, <HI>&s;he thoght &s;o
too;</HI> the Girl reply'd again, <HI>&s;he was &s;ure &s;he had
&s;een me before, but &s;he cou'd not recollect where;</HI> I an|&s;wer'd,
(tho' her Speech was not directed to me)
<HI>That I fancy'd &s;he had not &s;een me before, in</HI> England,
but ask'd, if &s;he had liv'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> She &s;aid, <HI>No,
no, &s;he had never been out of</HI> England; and I added;
<HI>That &s;he cou'd not then have known me in</HI> England
<HI>unle&s;s it was very lately, for had liv'd, at Rot|terdam
a great while:</HI> This carry'd me out of
that, Part of the Broil, pretty well; and to
make it go off the better, when a little <HI>Dutch</HI> Boy
came into the Cabbin, who belong'd to the Cap|tain,
and who I ea&s;ily perceiv'd to be <HI>Dutch,</HI> I
je&s;ted, and talk'd <HI>Dutch</HI> to him, and was merry
about the Boy, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> as merry as the
Con&s;ternation I was &s;till in, wou'd let me be.</P>
<P>However, I began to be thorowly convinc'd
by this time, that the Girl did not know me,
which was an infinite Satisfaction to me; or,
<HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> that tho' &s;he had &s;ome Notion of me, yet
that &s;he did not think any-thing about my being
who I was, and which perhaps, &s;he wou'd have
been as glad to have known, as I wou'd have
been &s;urpriz'd if &s;he had; indeed it was evident,
that had &s;he &s;u&s;pected any-thing of the Truth, &s;he
would not have been able to have conceal'd it.</P>
<P>Thus this Meeting went off, and, <HI>you may be &s;a$re,</HI>
I was re&s;olv'd, if once I got off of it, &s;he &s;hould ne|ver
&s;ee me again, to revive her Fancy; but I was mi|&s;taken
there too, <HI>as you &s;hall hear:</HI> After we had been
$$-board, the Captain's Lady carry'd us <HI>home to</HI>
her Hou&s;e, which was but ju&s;t on-&s;hore, and treat|ed
us there again, very hand&s;mely, and made us
promise that we wou'd come again and &s;ee her be&s;fore
we went, to concert our Affairs for the Voy|age,
<PB N="345" REF="350">
<HI>and the like;</HI> for &s;he a&s;&s;ur'd us, that both
&s;he and her Si&s;ter went the Voyage at that time,
for our Company; and I thought to my&s;elf, <HI>Then
you'll never go the Voyage at-all;</HI> for I &s;aw from that
Moment, that it wou'd be no way convenient for <HI>my
Lady&s;hip</HI> to go with them; for that frequent Con|ver&s;ation
might bring me to her Mind, and &s;he
wou'd certainly claim her Kindred to me in a few
Days, us indeed, wou'd have been the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It is hardly po&s;&s;ible for me to conceive what
wou'd have been our Part in this Affair, had my
Woman <HI>Amy</HI> gone with me on-board this Ship;
it had certainly blown-up the whole Affair, and I
mu&s;t for-ever after have been this Girl's Va&s;&s;al,
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> have let her into the Secret; and tru&s;t|ed
to her keeping in too, or have been expos'd, and
undone; <HI>the very Thought fill'd me with Horror.</HI></P>
<P>But I was not &s;o unhappy neither, as it fell out,
for <HI>Amy</HI> was not with us, and that was my De|liverance
indeed; yet we had another Chance to
get over &s;till: As I re&s;olv'd to put off the Voyage,
&s;o I re&s;olv'd to put Off the Vi&s;it, <HI>you may be &s;ure;</HI>
going upon this Principle, <HI>namely,</HI> that I was fix'd
in it, that the Girl had &s;een her la&s;t of me, and
&s;hou'd never &s;ee me more.</P>
<P>However, to bring my&s;elf well off, and withal
to &s;ee (if I cou'd) a little farther into the Matter,
I &s;ent my Friend, the QUAKER, to the Cap|tain's
Lady, to make the Vi&s;it promis'd, and to
make my Excu&s;e that I cou'd not po&s;&s;ibly wait on
her, for that I was very much out of Order; and
in the end of the Di&s;cour&s;e, I bade her in&s;inuate
to them, that &s;he was afraid I &s;hou'd not be able
to get ready to go the Voyage, &s;o &s;oon as the
Captain wou'd be oblig'd to go; and that per|haps
we might put it off to his next Voyage:
I did not let the QUAKER into any other Rea|&s;on
<PB N="346" REF="351">
for it, than that I was indi&s;pos'd; and not
knowing what other Face to put upon that Part,
I made her believe that I thought I was a-breed|ing.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;ie to put that into her Head, and &s;he
of cour&s;e hinted to the Captain's Lady, that &s;he
found me &s;o very ill, that &s;he was afraid I wou'd
mi&s;carry; and then, <HI>to be &s;ure,</HI> I cou'd not think
of going.</P>
<P>She went, and &s;he managd that Part very dexte|rou&s;ly,
<HI>as I knew &s;he wou'd,</HI> tho' &s;he knew not a
word of the grand Rea&s;on of my Indi&s;po&s;ition;
but I was all &s;unk, and dead-hearted again, when
&s;he told me, She cou'd not under&s;tand the Mean|ing
of one thing in her Vi&s;it, <HI>namely,</HI> That the
young Woman, <HI>as &s;he call'd her,</HI> that was with the
Captain's Lady, and who &s;he call'd Si&s;ter, was mo&s;t
impertinently inqui&s;itive into things; as who I was?
How long I had been in <HI>England?</HI> Where I had
liv'd? <HI>and the like;</HI> and that, <HI>above all the re&s;t,</HI>
&s;he enquir'd if I did not live once at the other
end of the Town.</P>
<P>I thought her Enquiries &s;o out of the way, <HI>&s;ays
the hone&s;t</HI> QUAKER, that I gave her not the lea&s;t
Satisfaction but as I &s;aw by <HI>the</HI> An&s;wers on-board
the Ship, when &s;he talk'd of <HI>thee,</HI> that <HI>thou</HI> did'&s;t
not incline to let her be acquainted with <HI>thee,</HI> &s;o
I was re&s;olv'd that &s;he &s;hou'd not be much the
wi&s;er for me; and when &s;he ask'd me if <HI>thou</HI>
ever liv'd'&s;t <HI>here or there,</HI> I always &s;aid <HI>No;</HI> but
that <HI>thou</HI> wa&s;t a <HI>Dutch</HI> Lady, and was going home
again to <HI>thy</HI> Family, and liv'd Abroad.</P>
<P>I thank'd her very heartily for that Part, and
indeed, &s;he &s;erv'd me in it, more than I let her
know &s;he did; <HI>in a word,</HI> &s;he thwarted the Girl
&s;o cleverly, that if &s;he had known the whole Af|fair,
&s;he cou'd not have done it better.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="352">
But I mu&s;t acknowledge, all this put me upon
the Rack again, and I was quite di&s;courag'd, not
at-all doubting but that the Jade had a right Scent
of things, and that &s;he knew and remember'd my
Face, but had artfully conceal'd her Knowledge
of me, till &s;he might perhaps, do it more to my
Di&s;advantage; I told all this to <HI>Amy, for &s;he was
all the Relief I had:</HI> The poor Soul (<HI>Amy</HI>) was rea|dy
to hang her&s;elf, that, <HI>as &s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he had been
the Occa&s;ion of it all; and that if I was ruin'd,
(<HI>which was the word I always us'd to her</HI>) &s;he had
ruin'd me; and &s;he tormented her&s;elf about it &s;o
much, that I was &s;ometimes fain to comfort her
and my&s;elf too.</P>
<P>What <HI>Amy</HI> vex'd her&s;elf at, was chiefly, that
&s;he &s;hou'd be &s;urpriz'd &s;o by the Girl, <HI>as &s;he call'd
her,</HI> I mean &s;urpriz'd into a Di&s;covery of her&s;elf to
<HI>the Girl;</HI> which indeed, was a fal&s;e Step of <HI>Amy</HI>'s,
and &s;o I had often told her; but 'twas to no Pur|po&s;e
to talk of that now the Bu&s;ine&s;s was, how
to get clear of the Girl's Su&s;picions, and of the
Girl too, for it look'd more threatning every Day,
than other and if I was unea&s;ie at what <HI>Amy</HI>
had told me of her rambling and rattling to her,
(<HI>Amy</HI>) I had a thou&s;and times as much rea&s;on to
be unea&s;ie <HI>now,</HI> when &s;he had chopp'd upon me
&s;o unhappily as this; and not only had &s;een my
Face, but knew too where I liv'd; what Name I
went by, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>And I am not come to the wor&s;t of it yet nei|ther,
for a few Days after my Friend the <HI>QUA|KER</HI>
had made her Vi&s;it, and excus'd me on the
account of Indi&s;po&s;ition; as if they had done it
in over and above Kindne&s;s, becau&s;e they had been
told I was not well, they comes both directly to
my Lodgings, to vi&s;it me; the Captain's Wife,
and my Daughter, (<HI>who &s;he call'd Si&s;ter</HI>) and the
<PB N="348" REF="353">
Captain to &s;how them the Place; the Captain only
brought them to the Door, put them in, and went
away upon &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Had not the kind QUAKER, in a lucky Mo|ment,
come running in before them, they had
not only clapp'd in upon me, in the Parlour, <HI>as it
had been a Surprize;</HI> but which wou'd have been
a thou&s;and times wor&s;e, had &s;een <HI>Amy</HI> with me;
I think if that had happen'd I had had no Re|medy,
but to take the Girl by her&s;elf, and have
made my&s;elf known to her, which wou'd have
been all Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>But the QUAKER, a lucky Creature to me,
happen'd to &s;ee them come to the Door, before
they rung the Bell, and in&s;tead of going to let
them in, came running in, with &s;ome Confu&s;ion
in her Countenance, and told me who was a-co|ming;
at which, <HI>Amy</HI> run fir&s;t, and I after her,
and bid the QUAKER come up as &s;oon as &s;he
had let them in.</P>
<P>I was going to bid her deny me, but it came
into my Thoughts, that having been repre&s;ented
&s;o much out of Order, it wou'd have look'd very
odd; be&s;ides, I knew the hone&s;t QUAKER,
tho' &s;he wou'd do any-thing el&s;e for me, wou'd
not LYE for me, and it wou'd have boon hard to
have de&s;ir'd it of her.</P>
<P>After &s;he had let them in, and brought them
into the Parlour, &s;he came up to <HI>Amy</HI> and <HI>I,</HI> who
were hardly out of the Flight, and yet were con|gratulating
one another, that <HI>Amy</HI> was not &s;urpriz'd
again.</P>
<P>They paid their Vi&s;it in Form, and I receiv'd
them as formally; but took Occca&s;ion two
or three times to hint, that I was &s;o ill that I
was afraid I &s;hou'd not be able to go to <HI>Holland,
at lea&s;t,</HI> not &s;o &s;oon as the Captain mu&s;t go off; and
<PB N="349" REF="354">
made my Compliment, how &s;orry I was to be di&s;|appointed
of the Advantage of their Company
and A&s;&s;itance in the Voyage; and &s;ometimes I
talk'd as if I thought I might &s;tay till the Cap|tain
return'd, and wou'd be ready to go again;
then the QUAKER put in, That then I might be
too far gone, <HI>meaning with-Child,</HI> that I &s;hou'd not
venture at-all; and then (<HI>as if &s;he &s;hou'd be pleas'd
with it</HI>) <HI>added,</HI> She hop'd I wou'd &s;tay and Lye-in
at her Hou&s;e; &s;o as this carried its own Face with
it, <HI>'twas well enough.</HI></P>
<P>But it was now high-time to talk of this to my,
Husband, which however, was not the greate&s;t Dif|faculty
before me: For after this and other Chat
had taken up &s;ome time, the young Fool began
her Tattle again; and two or three times &s;he
brought it in, That I was &s;o like a Lady that &s;he
had the Honour to know at the other end of the
Town, that &s;he cou'd not put that Lady out of
her Mind, <HI>when I was by;</HI> and once or twice I fan|cy'd
the Girl was ready to cry; by-and-by &s;he
was at it again; and at la&s;t, I plainly &s;aw Tears
in her Eyes:, upon which, <HI>I ask'd her if the Lady was
dead, becau&s;e &s;he &s;eem'd to be in &s;ome Concern for her;</HI>
&s;he made me much ea&s;ier by her An&s;wer, than
ever &s;he did before: <HI>She &s;aid, She did not really
know, bur &s;he believ'd &s;he was dead.</HI></P>
<P>This, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> a little reliev'd my Thoughts, but
I was &s;oon down again; for after &s;ome time, the
Jade began to grow Talkative and as it was plain,
that &s;he had told all that her Head cou'd retain of
<HI>Roxana,</HI> and the Days of Joy which I had &s;pent
at that Part of the Town, another Accident had
like to have blown us all up again.</P>
<P>I was in a kind of <HI>Di&s;habille</HI> when they came,
having on a loo&s;e Robe, like a Morning-Gown,
but much after the <HI>Italian</HI> Way, and I had not
<PB N="350" REF="355">
alter'd it when I went up, only dre&s;s'd my Head
a little; and as I had been rere&s;ented as having
been lately very ill, &s;o the Dre&s;s was becoming
enough for a Chamber.</P>
<P>This Morning-Ve&s;t, or Robe, <HI>call it as you plea&s;e,</HI>
was more &s;hap'd to the Body, than we wear them
&s;ince, &s;howing the Body in its true Shape, and
perhaps, a little too plainly, if it had been to be
worn where any Men were to come; but among
our&s;elves it was well enough, e&s;pecially for hot
Weather the Colour was green, figur'd; and the
Stuff a <HI>French</HI> Damask, very rich.</P>
<P>This Gown, or Ve&s;t, put the Girl's Tongue a-running
again, and her Si&s;ter, <HI>as &s;he call'd her,</HI>
prompted it; for as they both admir'd my Ve&s;t,
and were taken up much about the Beauty of the
Dre&s;s; the charming Damask; the noble Trim|ming,
<HI>and the like;</HI> my Girl puts in a Word to the
Si&s;ter, (<HI>Captain's Wife</HI>) This is ju&s;t &s;uch a Thing
as I told you, <HI>&s;ay &s;he,</HI> the Lady danc'd in: What,
<HI>&s;ays the Captain's Wife,</HI> the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> that you
told me of? O! that's a charming Story, <HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI>
tell it <HI>my Lady;</HI> I cou'd not avoid &s;aying &s;o too,
tho' from my Soul I wi&s;h'd her in Heaven for but
naming it; <HI>nay,</HI> I won't &s;ay but if &s;he had been
carried t'other Way, it had been much at one to
me, if I cou'd but have been rid of her, and her
Story too; for when &s;he came to de&s;cribe the
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s, it was impo&s;&s;ible but the QUAKER,
who was a &s;harp penetrating Creature, &s;hou'd re|ceive
the Impre&s;&s;ion in a more dangerous Manner,
than the Girl; only that indeed, &s;he was not &s;o
dangerous a Per&s;on; for if &s;he had known it all,
I cou'd more freely have tru&s;ted her, than I cou'd
the Girl, by a great-deal; <HI>nay,</HI> I &s;hou'd have been
perfectly ea&s;ie in her.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="356">
However, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> her Talk made me
dreadfully unea&s;ie, and the more when the Cap|tain's
Wife mention'd but the Name of <HI>Roxana;</HI>
what my Face might do towards betraying me, I
know not, becau&s;e I cou'd not &s;ee my&s;elf, but my
Heart beat as if it wou'd have jump'd out at my
Mouth; and my Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o great, that for
want of Vent, I thought I &s;hou'd have bur&s;t: <HI>In
a word,</HI> I was it a kind of a &s;ilent Rage; for the
Force I was under of re&s;training my Pa&s;&s;ion, was
&s;uch, as I never felt the like of: I had no Vent;
no-body to open my&s;elf to, or to make a Com|plaint
to for my Relief; I dur&s;t not leave the
Room by any means, for then &s;he wou'd have told
all the Story in my Ab&s;ence, and I &s;hou'd have
been perpetually unea&s;ie to know what &s;he had
&s;aid, or had not &s;aid; &s;o that, <HI>in a word,</HI> I was
oblig'd to &s;it and hear her tell all the Story of
<HI>Roxana, that is to &s;ay,</HI> of my&s;elf, and not know at
the &s;ame time, whether &s;he was in earne&s;t or in
je&s;t; whether &s;he knew me or no; or, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI>
whether I was to be expos'd, or not expos'd.</P>
<P>She began only in general, with telling where
&s;he liv'd; what a Place &s;he had of it; how gallant
a Company her Lady had always had in the Hou&s;e;
how they us'd to &s;it up all-Night in the Hou&s;e,
gaming and dancing; what a fine Lady her Mi|&s;tre&s;s
was; and what a va&s;t deal of Money the
upper Servants got; as for her, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> her whole
Bu&s;ine&s;s was in the next Hou&s;e, &s;o that &s;he got
but little; except one Night, that there was twenty
Guineas given to be divided among the Servants,
when, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he got two Guineas and a half for
her Share.</P>
<P>She went on, and told them how many Ser|vants
there was, and how they were order'd; but,
<HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> there was one Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> who was over
<PB N="352" REF="357">
them all; and that &s;he being the Lady's Favourite,
got a great-deal; &s;he did not know, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> whe|ther
<HI>Amy</HI> was her Chri&s;tian Name, or her Sir-Name,
but &s;he &s;uppos'd it was her Sir-Name; that
they were told, &s;he got three&s;core Pieces of Gold
at one time, being the &s;ame Night that the re&s;t of
the Servants had the twenty Guineas divided a|mong
them.</P>
<P>I put in at that Word, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> 'twas a va&s;t deal
to give away; why, <HI>&s;ays,</HI> 'twas a Portion for a
Servant: O Madam! <HI>&s;ay &s;he</HI> was nothing to
what &s;he got afterwards; we that were Servants,
hated her heartily for it, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> we wi&s;h'd
it had been our Lott, in her &s;tead: <HI>Then I &s;aid
again,</HI> Why, it was enough to get her a good
Husband, and &s;ettle her for the World, if &s;he had
Sence to manage it: So it might, <HI>to be &s;ure,</HI> Madam,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he;</HI> for we were told, &s;he laid up above 500 <HI>l.</HI>
But, <HI>I &s;ppo&s;e,</HI> Mrs. Amy was too &s;en&s;ible that her
Character wou'd require a good Portion to put her
Off.</P>

<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I don't know, but they talk'd
very much of a young Lord that was very great

I was willing to hear a little (<HI>&s;eeing &s;he wou'd talk of

<P>Thus far our Di&s;cour&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> went, and
no farther, for &s;he knew no more of her; but then
the QUAKER unhappily, tho' unde&s;ignedly, put

<P><PB N="354" REF="359">
<HI>Roxana! &s;ays &s;he;</HI> I know not what to &s;ay of

<P>I cannot help confe&s;&s;ing what a Re&s;erve of Pride

<P>This was &s;till agreeable to me one way; but
there was a devili&s;h Sting in the Tail of it all, and

<P>That's one of the brighte&s;t Parts of her Story

Balls and Meetings in her Lady&s;hip's Apartments,
every Week almo&s;t; bit one time <HI>my Lady</HI> invited

<P>I think you &s;aid, the KING was there, Si&s;ter,
didn't you?</P>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> that was the &s;econd time,
when <HI>they &s;aid</HI> the KING had heard how finely
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lady danc'd, and that he was there to
&s;ee her; but the KING, if His Maje&s;ty was there,
came di&s;guis'd.</P>
<P>That is what they call <HI>Incog. &s;ays my Friend the</HI>

wou'd di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf; yes, <HI>&s;ays the Girl,</HI> it was
&s;o, lie did not come in Publick, with his Guards,
but we all knew which was the KING, well e|nough;
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> which they &s;aid was the
KING.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays the Captain's Wife,</HI> about the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Dre&s;s; pray let us hear that: Why, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,
my Lady</HI> at in ii fine little Drawing-Room, which
open'd into the Great Room, and where &s;he re|ceiv'd
die Compliments of the Company; and
when the Dancing began, a great Lord, <HI>&s;ays &s;he, I
forget who they calld him,</HI> (but he was a very great
Lord or Duke, I don't know which) took her
out, and danc'd with her; but after a-while, my
Lady on a &s;udden &s;hut the Drawing-Room, and
run up-&s;tairs with her Woman, Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> and
tho' &s;he did not &s;tay long, (<HI>for I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had
<PB N="356" REF="361">
contriv'd it all before-hand</HI>) &s;he came down dre&s;s'd
in the &s;trange&s;t Figure that ever I &s;aw in <HI>my Life;</HI>
but it was exceeding fine.</P>
<P>Here &s;he went on to de&s;cribe the Dre&s;s, as I
have done already; but did it &s;o exactly, that I
was &s;urpriz'd at the Manner of her telling it;
there was not a Circum&s;tance of it left out.</P>
<P>I was now under a new Perplexity; for this
young Slut gave &s;o compleat an Account of every|thing
in the Dre&s;s, that my Friend the QUAKER
colour'd at it, and look'd two or three times, at me,
to &s;ee if I did not do &s;o too; for (<HI>as &s;he told me
afterwards</HI>) &s;he immediately perceiv'd it was the
&s;ame Dre&s;s that &s;he had &s;een me have on, as I have
&s;aid before: However, as &s;he &s;aw I took no Notice
of it, &s;he kept her Thoughts private to her&s;elf;
and I did &s;o too, as well us I cou'd.</P>
<P>I put in two or three times that &s;he had a
good Memory, that cou'd be &s;o particular in every
Part of &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P>O Madam! <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> we that were Servants, &s;tood
by our&s;elves in a Corner, but &s;o, as we cou'd &s;ee
more than &s;ome Strangers be&s;ides, &s;ay &s;he, it was
all our Conver&s;ation for &s;everal Days in the Fa|mily,
and what one did not ob&s;erve, another did:
Why, &s;ays I to her, this was no Per&s;ian Dre&s;s;
only, I &s;uppo&s;e, your Lady was &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Come|dian,
that is to &s;ay, a Stage Amazon, that put on a
counterfeit Dre&s;s to plea&s;e the Company, &s;uch as
they us'd in the Play of <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> at Paris, or
&s;ome &s;uch.</P>
<P>No indeed, Madam, <HI>&s;ays &s;he, I a&s;&s;ure you,</HI> my Lady
was no Actre&s;s; &s;he was a fine mode&s;t Lady, fit to
be a Prince&s;s; every-body &s;aid, If &s;he was a Mi&s;tre&s;s,
&s;he was fit to be a Mi&s;tre&s;s to none but the KING;
and they talk'd her up for the KING, as if it
really been &s;o: Be&s;ides, Madam, <HI>&s;he &s;ays,</HI> my

Lady danc'd a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dance, all the Lords and
Gentry &s;aid it was &s;o; and one of them &s;wore,
<HI>he had &s;een it danc'd in</HI> Turkey <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> &s;o that
it cou'd not come from the Theatre at <HI>Paris;</HI>
and then the Name <HI>Roxana, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> was a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Name.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but that was not your Lady's
Name, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>No, no, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, I know that; I know
my Lady's Name and Family very well; <HI>Roxana</HI>
was not her Name, that's true indeed.</P>
<P>Here &s;he run me a-ground again; for I dur&s;t not
ask her what was <HI>Roxan's</HI> a real Name, left &s;he
had really dealt with the Devil, and had boldly
given my own Name in for An&s;wer: So that I
was &s;till more and more afraid that the Girl had
really gotten the Secret &s;omewhere or other; tho'
I cou'd not imagine neither, how that cou'd be.</P>
<P><HI>In a word,</HI> I was &s;ick of the Di&s;cour&s;e, and en|deavour'd
many ways to put an End to it, but it
was impo&s;&s;ible; for the Captain's Wife, <HI>who call'd
her Si&s;ter,</HI> prompted her, and pre&s;s'd her to tell it,
mo&s;t ignorantly thinking, that it wou'd be a plea|&s;ant
Tale to all of us.</P>
<P>Two or three times the QUAKER put in, That
this Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> had a good Stock at A&s;&s;urance;
and that 'twas likely, it &s;he had been in <HI>Turkey,</HI>
&s;he had liv'd with, or been kept by, &s;ome Great
<HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> there: But &s;till &s;he wou'd break-in upon all
&s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e, and fly-out into the mo&s;t extrava|gant
Prai&s;es of her Mi&s;tre&s;s, the fam'd <HI>Roxana:</HI>
I run her down, as &s;ome &s;candalous Woman; that
it was not po&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e; but &s;he wou'd
not hear of it; her Lady was a Per&s;on of &s;uch
and &s;uch Qualifications; that nothing but un An|gel
was like her, <HI>to be &s;ure;</HI> and yet, <HI>after all &s;he</HI>
cou'd &s;ay, her own Account brought her down to
<PB N="358" REF="363">
this, That, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> her Lady kept little le&s;s than
a Gaming-Ordinary; or, <HI>as it wou'd be called in
the Times &s;ine that,</HI> an A&s;&s;embly for Gallantry and
Play.</P>
<P>All this while I was very unea&s;ie, <HI>as I &s;aid be|fore,</HI>
and yet the whole Story went off again-with|out
any Di&s;covery, only that I &s;eem'd a little con|cern'd,
that &s;he &s;hou'd liken me to this gay Lady,
who&s;e Character I pretended to run down very
much, even upon the foot of her own Relation.</P>
<P>But I was not at the End of my Mortifications
yet neither; for now my innocent QUAKER
threw out an unhappy Expre&s;&s;ion, which put me
upon the Tenters again; <HI>Says &s;he to me,</HI> This Lady's
Habit, <HI>I fancy,</HI> is ju&s;t &s;uch a-one as <HI>thine,</HI> by the De|&s;cription
of it; <HI>and then turning to the Captain's
Wife, &s;ays &s;he, I fancy, my</HI> Friend has a finer
<HI>Turki&s;h or Per&s;ian</HI> Dre&s;s, a great-deal: O! <HI>&s;ays the
Girl,</HI> 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to be finer; my Lady's, <HI>&s;ays
&s;he,</HI> was all cover'd with Gold, and Diamonds;
her Hair and Head-Dre&s;s, <HI>I forgot the Name they
gave it, &s;aid &s;ghe,</HI> &s;hone like the Stars, there was
&s;o many Jewels in it.</P>
<P>I never wi&s;h'd my good Friend the QUAKER
out of my Company before <HI>now;</HI> but indeed,
I wou'd have given &s;ome Guineas to have been
rid of her <HI>ju&s;t now;</HI> for beginning to be curi|ous
in the comparing the two Dre&s;&s;es, &s;he inno|cently;
began a De&s;cription of <HI>mine;</HI> and nothing
terrify'd me &s;o much, as the Apprehen&s;ion le&s;t
&s;he &s;hou'd importune me to &s;how it, which I was
re&s;olv'd I wou'd never agree to.</P>
<P>But before it came to this, &s;he pre&s;s'd <HI>my Girl</HI>
to de&s;cribe the <HI>Tyhaia,</HI> or Head-dre&s;s; which &s;he
did &s;o cleverly, that the QUAKER cou'd not
help &s;aying, <HI>Mine was ju&s;t &s;uch a-one;</HI> and after
&s;everal other Similitudes, all very vexatious to
<PB N="359" REF="364">
me, out comes the kind Motion to me, <HI>to let
the Ladies &s;ee my Dre&s;s;</HI> and they join'd their ea|ger
De&s;ires of it? even to Importunity.</P>
<P>I de&s;ir'd to be excus'd; tho' I had little to &s;ay
at fir&s;t, why I declin'd it; but at la&s;t, it came into
my Head to &s;ay, <HI>It was pack'd up with my other
Cloaths that I had lea&s;t Occa&s;ion for, in order to be &s;ent
on-board the Captain's Ship;</HI> but that if we liv'd to
come to Holland together, (which, <HI>by the way,</HI> I re|&s;olv'd
&s;hou'd never happen) then, I told then, at
unpacking my Cloaths, they &s;hou'd &s;ee me dre&s;s'd
in it; but they mu&s;t not expect I &s;hou'd dance in
it, like the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> in all her &s;ine things.</P>
<P>This carry'd it off pretty well; and getting over
this, got over mo&s;t of the re&s;t, and I began to be
ea&s;ie again; and, <HI>in a word,</HI> that I may di&s;mi&s;s the
Story too, as &s;oon as may be, I got-rid at la&s;t, of
my Vi&s;itors, who I had wi&s;h'd gone two Hours
&s;oner than they intended it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, I run up to <HI>Amy,</HI>
and gave Vent to my Pa&s;&s;ions, by telling her the
whole Story, and letting her &s;ee what Mi&s;chiefs
one fal&s;e Step of hers had like, unluckily, to have
involv'd us all in, more perhaps, than we cou'd
ever have liv'd to get through: <HI>Amy</HI> was &s;en&s;ible
of it enough, and was ju&s;t giving her Wrath a
Vent another way, <HI>viz.</HI> by calling the poor Girl
all the damn'd Jades and Fools, <HI>&s;aid &s;ometimes wor&s;e
Names</HI>) that &s;he cou'd think of; in the middle of
which, up comes my hone&s;t good QUAKER, and
put an end to our Di&s;cour&s;e: The QUAKE$ $ame
in &s;iniling, (for &s;he was always &s;o $crly $word$)
<HI>Well, &s;ays &s;he, Thou act deli$ $$$d at la&s;t; I $word$
To joy thee of it; I perceiv'd thou $span$
Vou&s;ly of thy Vi&s;itors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Indeed,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>&s;o I was;</HI> $word$ fool$$$ young
Girl held us all in a Ca$bury $word$, I $chought
<PB N="360" REF="365">
&s;he wou'd never have done with it: Why truly,
I thought &s;he was very careful to let <HI>thee</HI> know
&s;he was but a Cookmaid: Ay, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and at a
Gaming-Hou&s;e, or Gaming-Ordinary, and at t'o|ther-end
of the Town too; all which (<HI>by the way</HI>)
&s;he might know, wou'd add very little to her
Good-Name among us Citizens.</P>
<P>I can't think, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> QUAKER, but &s;he had
&s;ome other Drift in that long Di&s;cour&s;e; there's
&s;omething el&s;e in her Head, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I am &s;atisfy'd
of that: <HI>Thought I,</HI> are you &s;atisfy'd of it? I am
&s;ure I am the le&s;s &s;atisfy'd for that; <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> 'tis
but &s;mall Satisfaction to me, to hear you &s;ay &s;o:
What can this be? <HI>&s;ays I;</HI> and when will my
Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es have an end? <HI>But this was &s;ilent, and to
my&s;elf, you may be &s;ure:</HI> But in An&s;wer to my Friend
the QUAKER, I return'd, by asking her a Que|&s;tion
or two about it: As what &s;he thought was
in it? and why &s;he thought there was any-thing in
it? For, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> &s;he can have nothing in it relating
to me.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays the kind</HI> QUAKER, if &s;he had any
View towards <HI>thee,</HI> that's no Bu&s;ine&s;s of mine; and
I &s;hou'd be far from de&s;iring <HI>thee</HI> to inform me.</P>
<P>This allarm'd me again; not that I fear'd tru&s;t|ing
the good-humour'd Creature with it, if there
bad been any-thing of ju&s;t Su&s;picion in her;
hut this Affair was a Secret I car'd not to commu|nicate
to any-body: However, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> this allarm'd
me a little; for as I had conceal'd every-thing
from her, I was willing to do &s;o &s;till; but as &s;he
cou'd not but gather up abundance of things from
the Girl's Di&s;cour&s;e, which look'd towards me, &s;o
&s;he was too penetrating to be put-off with &s;uch
An&s;wers, as might &s;top another's Mouth: Only
there was this double Felicity in it; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> That
&s;he was not Inqui&s;itive to know, or find any-thing
<PB N="361" REF="366">
out; and not dangerous, if &s;he had known the
whole Story: But, <HI>as I &s;ay,</HI> &s;he cou'd not but ga|ther
up &s;everal Circum&s;tances from the Girl's Di&s;|cour&s;e;
as particularly, the Name of <HI>Amy;</HI> and
the &s;everal De&s;criptions of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s, which
my Friend the QUAKER, had &s;een, and taken &s;o
much Notice of, <HI>as I have &s;aid above.</HI></P>
<P>As for that, I might have turn'd it off by je&s;t|ing
with <HI>Amy,</HI> and asking her, who &s;he liv'd with
before &s;he came to live with me? but that wou'd
not do; for we had unhappily anticipated that
way of talking, by having often talk'd how long
<HI>Amy</HI> had liv'd with me; and which was &s;till wor&s;e,
by having own'd formerly, that I had had Lodg|ings
in the <HI>Pallmall;</HI> &s;o that all tho&s;e things cor|re&s;ponded
too well: There was only one thing that
help'd me out with the QUAKER, and that was,
the Girl's having reported how rich Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI> was
grown, and that &s;he kept Her Coach; now as
there might be many more Mrs. <HI>Amy</HI>'s be&s;ides
<HI>mine,</HI> &s;o it was not likely to be my <HI>Amy,</HI> becau&s;e
&s;he was far from &s;uch a Figure as keeping her
Coach; and this carry'd it off from the Su&s;pic|ons
which the good Friendly QUAKER might
have in her Head.</P>
<P>But as to what &s;he imagined <HI>the Girl</HI> had in her
Head, there lay more real Difficulty in that Part,
a great-deal; and I was allarm'd at it very much;
for my Friend the QUAKER, <HI>told me,</HI> She ob|&s;erv'd
that the <HI>Girl</HI> was in a great Pa&s;&s;ion when
talk'd of the Habit, and more when I had
been importun'd to &s;how her mine, but declin'd
it: <HI>She &s;aid,</HI> She &s;everal times perceiv'd her to be

thought that, I wou'd have put her out of her

I began to believe &s;o too, and &s;hou'd have be|liev'd
&s;o &s;till, if <HI>thou</HI> had, &s;t not &s;atisfy'd me to
the contrary, by thy taking no Notice of It, and
by what <HI>thou</HI> ha&s;t &s;aid &s;ince: Shou'd you have
believ'd &s;o? &s;aid I, <HI>warmly,</HI> I am very &s;orry for

when &s;he nam'd <HI>thy</HI> Maid <HI>Amy</HI> too, and &s;everal
other Circum&s;tamces concurring? I &s;hou'd certainly
have believ'd it, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> if <HI>thou</HI> had'&s;t not con|tracidted
it; but as &s;oon as I heard <HI>thee</HI> &s;peak, I
concluded it was otherwi&s;e: That was very kind,
&s;aid I, and I am oblig'd to you for doing me &s;o
much Ju&s;tice; 'tis more it &s;eems, than young
talking Creature that does: Nay, &s;ays the QUAKER,

affront her: No, <HI>thou</HI> &s;halt not affront her, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI>
(full of her good-humour and Temper) I'll take
that Part off thy hands, for I'll affront her for
<HI>thee,</HI> and not let her &s;ee <HI>thee;</HI> I thought that was
a very kind Offer, but was at a Lo&s;s how &s;he
wou'd be able to do it; and the Thought of
&s;eeing her there again, half di&s;tracted me; not
knowing what Temper &s;he wou'd come in, much
le&s;s what Manner to receive her in; but my fa&s;t
Friend, and con&s;tant Comforter, the QUAKER,
&s;aid &s;he perceiv'd the Girl was impertinent, and
that I had no Inclination to conver&s;e with her;
and &s;he was re&s;olv'd I &s;hou'd not be troubled with
her: But I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;ay more of this
pre&s;ently for this Girl went farther yet, than I
thought &s;he had.</P>
<P>It was now time, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> to take Mea|&s;uies
with my Husband, in order to put-off
my Voyage; &s;o I fell into Talk with, him one
Morning as he was dre&s;&s;ing, and while I was in-Bed;
I pretended I was very ill; and as I had but
too ea&s;ie a Way to impo&s;e upon him, becau&s;e he
&s;o ab&s;olutely believ'd every-thing I &s;aid; &s;o I ma|nag'd
my Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o, as that he &s;hould under|&s;tand
by it, I was a-breeding, tho' I did not tell
him &s;o.</P>
<P>However, I brought it about &s;o hand&s;omely,
that before he went out of the Room, he came and
&s;at down by my Bed-&s;ide, and began to calk very
&s;eriou&s;ly to me, upon the Subject of my being
&s;o every-Day ill; and that, as he hop'd I was
with-Child, he wou'd have me con&s;ider well of it,
whether I had not be&s;t alter my Thoughts the
Voyage to <HI>Holland;</HI> for that being Sea-&s;ick, and
<PB N="364" REF="369">
which was wor&s;e, if a Storm &s;hou'd happen, might
be very dangerous to me; and after &s;aying abun|dance
of the kinde&s;t things that the kinde&s;t of
Husbands in the World cou'd &s;ay, he concluded,
That it was his Reque&s;t to me, that I wou'd not
think any-more of going, till after all &s;hou'd be
over; but that I wou'd, <HI>on the contrary,</HI> prepare to
Lye-in where I was, and where I knew as well as
he, I cou'd be very well provided, and very well
a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>This was ju&s;t what I wanted; for I had, <HI>as you
have heard,</HI> a thou&s;and good Rea&s;ons why I &s;hou'd
put off the Voyage, <HI>e&s;pecially,</HI> with that Creature in
Company, but I had a-mind the putting it off &s;hou'd
be at his Motion, not my own; and he came into
it of him&s;elf, ju&s;t as I wou'd have had it: This
gave me an Opportunity to hang-back a little, and
to &s;eem as if I was unwilling: <HI>I told him,</HI> I cou'd
not abide to put him to Difficulties and Perplexi|ties
in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; that now he had hir'd the
Great-Cabbin in the Ship, <HI>and perhaps,</HI> paid &s;ome
of the Money, and, <HI>it may be,</HI> taken Freight for
Goods; and to make him break it all off again,
wou'd be a needle&s;s Charge to him, <HI>or perhaps?</HI> a
Damage to the Captain.</P>
<P>As to that, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> it was not to be nam'd, and
he wou'd not allow it to be any Con&s;ideration at-all;
that he cou'd ea&s;ily pacific the Captain of
the Shim by telling him the Rea&s;on of it; and
that if he did make him &s;ome Satisfaction for the
Di&s;ppointment, it &s;hou'd not be much.</P>
<P>But my Dear, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you ha'n't heard me &s;ay
I am with-Child, neither can I &s;ay &s;o; and if it
&s;hou'd not be &s;o at la&s;t, then I &s;hall have made a
fine Piece of Work of it indeed; be&s;ides, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI>
the two Ladies, the Captain's Wife, and Her Si|&s;ter,
they depend upon our going over, and have
<PB N="365" REF="370">
made great Preparations, and all in Compliment
to me; what mu&s;t I &s;ay to them?</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, &s;ays he, if you &s;hou'd not be
with-Child, tho' I hope you are, yet there is no
harm done; the &s;taying three or four Months
longer in <HI>England</HI> will be no Damage to me,
and we can go when we plea&s;e, when we are &s;ure
yon are riot with-Child, or when it appearing
that you are with-Child, you &s;hall be down and
up again; and as for the Captain's Wife and Si|&s;ter,
leave that Part to me, I'll an&s;wer for it, there
&s;hall be no Quarrel rais'd upon that Subject; I'll
make your Excu&s;e to them by the Captain him|&s;elf;
&s;o all will be well enough there, I'll war|rant
you.</P>
<P>This was as much as I cou'd de&s;ire; and thus
it re&s;ted for a-while: I had indeed, &s;ome anxious
Thoughts about this impertinent Girl, but believ'd
that putting off the Voyage wou'd have put an End
to it all; &s;o I began to be pretty ea&s;ie; but I found
my&s;elf mi&s;taken, for I was brought to the Point of
De&s;truction by her again, and that in the mo&s;t un|accountable
Manner imaginable.</P>
<P>My Husband, as he and I had agreed, meeting
the Captain of the Ship, took the Freedom to tell
him, That he was afraid he mu&s;t di&s;appoint him,
for that &s;omething had fallen out, which had o|blig'd
him to alter his Mea&s;ures, and that his Fa|mily
cou'd not be ready to go, time enough for
him.</P>
<P>I know the Occa&s;ion, Sir, <HI>&s;ays the Captain;</HI> I
hear your Lady has got a Daughter more than &s;he
expected; I give you Joy of it: What do you
mean by that? <HI>&s;ays my Spou&s;e:</HI> Nay, nothing, <HI>&s;ays
the Captain,</HI> but what I hear the Women tattle over
the Tea-Table; I know nothing, but that you
don't go the Voyage upon it, which I am &s;orry
<PB N="366" REF="371">
for; but you know your own Affairs, <HI>added the
Captain,</HI> that's no Bu&s;ine&s;s of mine.</P>
<P>Well but, <HI>&s;ays my Husband,</HI> I mu&s;t make you
&s;ome Satisfaction for the Di&s;appointment, and &s;o
pulls out his Money: No, no, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> and
&s;o they fell to &s;training their Compliments one up|on
another; but, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> my Spou&s;e gave him
three or four Guineas, and made him take it; and
&s;o the fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e went off again, and they
had no more of it.</P>
<P>But it did not go off &s;o ea&s;ily with me; for
now, <HI>in a word,</HI> the Clouds begen to thicken about
me, and I had Allarms on every &s;ide: My Hus|band
told me what the Captain had &s;aid; but
very happily took it, that the Captain had brought
a Tale by-halves, and having heard it one way,
had told it another; and that neither cou'd he
under&s;tand the Captain, ueither did the Captain
nnder&s;tand him&s;elf; &s;o he contented him&s;elf to
tell me, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> word for word, as the Captain de|liver'd
it.</P>
<P>How I kept my Husband from discovering my di&s;covering, my
Di&s;order, <HI>you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently;</HI> but let it &s;uffice
to &s;ay ju&s;t now, that if my Husband did not under|&s;tand
the Captain, nor the Captain under&s;tand
him&s;elf, yet I under&s;tood them both very well;
and to tell the Truth, it was a wor&s;e Shock than
ever I had had yet: Invention &s;upply'd me in|deed,
with a &s;udden Motion to avoid &s;howing
my Surprize; for as my Spoute and I was &s;itting
by a little Table, near the Fire, I reach d out mg
Hand, as if I had intended to take a Spoon which
lay on the other &s;ide, and threw one of the Can|dles
off of the Table; and then &s;natching it up,
&s;tarted up upon my Feet, and &s;toop'd to the Lap
of my Gown, and took it in my Hand; O! <HI>&s;ays I,</HI>
my Gown's &s;poil'd; the Candle has greas'd it
<PB N="367" REF="372">
prodigiou&s;ly: This furni&s;h'd me with an Excu&s;e
to my Spou&s;e, to break off the Di&s;cour&s;e for the
pre&s;ent, an call <HI>Amy</HI> down; and Amy not coming
pre&s;ently, I &s;aid to him, My Dear, I mu&s;t run up|&s;tairs,
and put it off, and let <HI>Amy</HI> clean it a-little;
&s;o my Husband ri&s;e up too, and went into a Clo|&s;et,
where he kept his Papers and Books, and
fetch'd a Book out, and &s;at down by him&s;elf, to
read.</P>
<P>Glad I was that I had got away; and up I run
to <HI>Amy,</HI> who, as it happen'd, was alone; <HI>O Amy!
&s;ays I,</HI> we are all utterly undone; and with that,
I bur&s;t out a-crying, and cou'd not &s;peak a Word
for a great-while.</P>
<P>I cannot help &s;aying, that &s;ome very good Re|flections
offer'd them&s;elves upon this Head; it
pre&s;ently occurr'd, What a glorious Te&s;timony it is
to the Ju&s;tice of Providence, und to the Concern
Providence has in guiding all the Affairs of Men,
(<HI>even the lea&s;t, as well as the greate&s;t</HI>) that the mo&s;t
&s;ecret Crimes are, by the mo&s;t unfore&s;een Acci|dents,
brought to light, and di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>Another Reflection was, How ju&s;t it is, that Sin
and Shame follow one-another &s;o con&s;tantly at the
Heels, that they are not like Attendants only, but
like Cau&s;e and Con&s;equence, nece&s;&s;aly connected
one with another; that the Crime going before,
the Scandal is certain to follow; and that 'tis not
in the Power of humane Nature to conceal the
fir&s;t, or avoid the la&s;t.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I do? <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>as &s;oon as I cou'd
&s;peak;</HI> and what will become of me? and then I
cry'd again &s;o vehemently, that I cou'd &s;ay no
more a great-while; <HI>Amy</HI> was frighted almo&s;t out
of her Wits, but knew nothing what the Matter
was; but &s;he begg'd to know, and per&s;waded me
to compo&s;e my&s;elf and not cry &s;o: Why Madam,
<PB N="368" REF="373">
If my Ma&s;ter &s;hou'd come up now, &s;ays &s;he, he will
&s;ee what a Di&s;order you are in; he will know you
have been crying, and then he will want to know
the Cau&s;e of it; with that I broke-out again, O!
he knows it already, <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;ays I; he knows all;
'tis all di&s;cover'd! and we are undone! <HI>Amy</HI> was
Thunder-&s;truck now indeed: Nay, <HI>&s;ays Amy,</HI> if
that be true, we are undone indeed; but that can
never be; that's impo&s;&s;ible, I'm &s;ure.</P>
<P>No, <HI>no, &s;ays I,</HI> 'tis far from impo&s;&s;ible, for I tell
you 'tis &s;o; and by this time being a little reco|ver'd,
I told her what Di&s;cour&s;e my Husband and
the Captain had had together, and what the Cap|tain
had &s;aid: This put <HI>Amy</HI> into &s;uch a Hurry,
that &s;he cry'd; &s;he rav'd; &s;he &s;wore and curs'd
like a Mad-thing; then &s;he upbraided me, that I
wou'd not let her kill the Girl when &s;he wou'd
have done it; and that it was all my own doing,
<HI>and the like:</HI> Well however, I was not for killing
the Girl yet, I cou'd not bear the Thoughts of that
neither.</P>
<P>We &s;pent half an Hour in the&s;e Extravagances,
and brought nothing out of them neither; for
indeed, we cou'd do nothing, or lay nothing, that
was to the Purpo&s;e; for if any-thing was to come
out-of-the-way, there was no hindring it, nor help
for it; &s;o after thus giving a Vent to my&s;elf by
crying, I began to reflect how I had left my Spou&s;e
below, and what I had pretended to come up for;
&s;o I chang'd my Gown that I pretended the Can|dle
fell upon, and put on another, and went down.</P>
<P>When I had been down a good-while, and found
my Spou&s;e did not fall into the Story again, as I
expected, I took-heart, and call'd for it: My
Dear, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> the Fall of the Candle put you out
of your Hi&s;tory; won't you go on with it? What,
Hi&s;tory? <HI>&s;ays he:</HI> Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> about the Cap|tain;
<PB N="369" REF="374">
O! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I had done with it; I know
no more, than that the Captain told a broken
Piece of News that he had heard by halves, and
told more by halves than he heard it; <HI>namely,</HI> of
your being with-Child, and that you cou'd not go
the Voyage.</P>
<P>I perceiv'd my Husband enter'd not into the
thing at-all, but took it for-a Story, which being
told two or three times over, was puzzl'd, and
come to nothing; and that all that was meant by
it was, what he knew, or thought he knew al|ready,
<HI>viz.</HI> that I was with-Child, which he wi&s;h'd
might be true.</P>
<P>His Ignorance was a Cordial to my Soul; and I
curs'd them in my Thoughts, that &s;hou'd ever un|deceive
him; and as I &s;aw him willing to have the
Story end there, as not worth being farther men|tion'd,
I clos'd it too; and &s;aid, I &s;uppos'd the Cap|tain
had it from his Wife; &s;he might have found
&s;omebody el&s;e to make her Remarks upon, and
&s;o it pa&s;s'd off with my Husband well enough,
and I was &s;till &s;afe there, where I thought my&s;elf
in mo&s;t Danger; but I had two Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es &s;till;
<HI>the fir&s;t was,</HI> le&s;t the Captain and my Spou&s;e
&s;hou'd meet again, and enter into farther Di&s;|cour&s;e
about it; and <HI>the &s;econd</HI> was, le&s;t die bu&s;ie
impertinent Girl &s;hou'd come again, and when &s;he
came, how to prevent her &s;eeing <HI>Amy,</HI> which was
an Article as material as any of the re&s;t; for &s;eeing
<HI>Amy,</HI> wou'd have been as fatal to me, as her know|ing
all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e, I knew the Captain
cou'd not &s;tay in Town above a Week; but that
his Ship being already full of Goods, and fallen
down the River, he mu&s;t &s;oon follow; &s;o I
contriv'd to carry my Husband &s;omewhere out of
Town for a few Days, that they might be &s;ure not
to meet.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="375">
My greate&s;t Concern was, where we &s;hou'd go;
at la&s;t I fix'd upon <HI>North-Hall,</HI> not, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> that
I wou'd drink the Waters, but that, I thought
the Air was good, and might be for my Advan|tage
He who did evrery-thing upon the Foun|dation

&s;o many Eyes that had &s;een before So that,
<HI>after &s;ame time,</HI> I told my Husband that I thought
Newnarket was &s;o of People at that time, that
we &s;hou'd get no Accommodation; that feeing the
Court, and the Crowd, was no Entertainment
at all to me, unlie&s;s as it might be &s;o to him that
if he thought fit, we won'd rather put it off to ano|ther
time off to another time and that if when he went-to Holland,
we &s;ou'd go by Harwich we might take a round
By Newmarket and Bury, and &s;o come down to
<HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> and go from thence to the Sea-&s;ide: He
was ea&s;ly put off from this, as he was from any|thing
el&s;e, that I did not approve; and &s;o with
all imaginable Facility he appointed to be ready
early in the Morning to go with me for Tun|bridge.</P>
<P>I had a double De&s;ign in this, <HI>viz</HI> fir&s;t, to
get away my Spou&s;t from &s;eeing the Captain any|more;
and &s;ecoudly, To be out of the way my &s;elf,
in ca&s;e this impertinent Girl, who was now my Plague,
&s;hou'd offer to come again, as my friend the Quaker
<HI>beliv'd the wou'd</HI> and as indeed, happen'd
within two or three Days a&s;terwards.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ecur'd my going away the next

<HEAD>N. B. My Husband gave her that Name in je&s;t,
on our Wedding-Day, and we had call'd her
by it ever aFter; &s;o that &s;he &s;poke literally true
at that time.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Girl reply'd very mode&s;tly,</HI> That &s;he was &s;orry
if &s;he gave her any Offence in asking; that &s;he did
not de&s;ign to be rude to her, or pretend to exa|mine
her; but that &s;he was in &s;uch an Agony at
this Di&s;a&s;ter, that &s;he knew not what &s;he did or
&s;aid; and that &s;he &s;hou'd be very &s;orry to di&s;oblige
her; but begg'd of her again, as &s;he was a Chri|&s;tian,
and a Woman, and had been a Mother of
Children, that &s;he wou'd take Pity on her, and,
<HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;o that &s;he might but come to
me, and &s;peak a few Words to me.</P>
<P>The tender-hearted QUAKER told me, the
Girl &s;poke this with &s;uch moving Eloquence, that
it forc'd Tears from her; but &s;he was oblig'd to
&s;ay, That &s;he neither knew where I was gone, or
how to write to me; but that if &s;he did ever $ee
me again, &s;he wou'd not Fail to give me an Ac|count
of all &s;he had &s;aid to her, or that &s;he &s;hou'd
<PB N="378" REF="383">
yet think fit to &s;ay; and to take my An&s;wer to
it, if I thought fit to give any.</P>
<P>Then the QUAKER took the Freedom to ask
a few Particulars about this wonderful Story,
<HI>as &s;he call'd it;</HI> at which, the Girl beginning at
the fir&s;t Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my Life, <HI>and indeed, of her
own,</HI> went thro' all the Hi&s;tory of her mi&s;erable
Education; her Service under the Lady <HI>Roxana,
as &s;he call'd me,</HI> and her Relief by Mrs. <HI>Amy;</HI> with
the Rea&s;ons &s;he had to believe, that as <HI>Amy</HI>
own'd her&s;elf to be the &s;ame that liv'd with her
Mother, <HI>and e&s;pecially,</HI> that <HI>Amy</HI> was the Lady
<HI>Roxana's</HI> Maid too, and came out of <HI>France</HI> with
her, She was by tho&s;e Circum&s;tances, and &s;everal
others in her Conver&s;ation, as fully convinc'd,
that the Lady <HI>Roxana</HI> was her Mother, as &s;he
was that the Lady&mdash;at her Hou&s;e [<HI>the
Quaker's</HI>] was the very &s;ame <HI>Roxana</HI> that &s;he had
been Servant to.</P>
<P>My good Friend the QUAKER, tho' terribly
&s;hock'd at the Story, and not well-knowing what
to &s;ay, yet was too much my Friend to &s;eem con|vinc'd
in a Thing, which &s;he did not know to
be true, and which, if it was true, &s;he cou'd &s;ee
plainly I had a-mind &s;hou'd not be known; &s;o &s;he
turn'd her Di&s;cour&s;e to argue the Girl out of it:
She in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;lender Evidence &s;he had
of the Fact it &s;elf, and the Rudene&s;s of claiming
&s;o near a Relation of one &s;o much above her, and
of who&s;e Concern in it &s;he had no Knowledge, <HI>$word$
lea&s;t,</HI> no &s;ufficient Proof; that as the Lady at her
Hou&s;e was a Per&s;on above any Di&s;gui&s;s, &s;o &s;he
cou'd not believe that &s;he wou'd deny her being
her Daughter, if &s;he was really her Mother; that
the was able &s;ufficiently to have provided for her,
if &s;he had not a-mind to have her known; and
therefore, &s;eeing &s;he had heard all &s;he had &s;aid of
<PB N="379" REF="384">
the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> and was &s;o far from owning
her&s;elf to be the Per&s;on, &s;o &s;he had cen&s;ur'd that
Sham-Lady as a Cheat, and a Common Woman;
and that 'twas certain &s;he cou'd never be brought
to own a Name and Character &s;he had &s;o ju&s;tly
expos'd.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide, <HI>&s;he told her,</HI> that her Lodger, <HI>meaning me,</HI>
was not a Sham-Lady, but the real Wife of a
Knight Baronet; and that &s;he knew her to be
hone&s;tly &s;uch, and far above &s;uch a Per&s;on as &s;he
had de&s;crib'd; <HI>She then added,</HI> that &s;he had ano|ther
Rea&s;on why it was not very po&s;&s;ible to be
true, <HI>and that is, &s;ays &s;he, Thy</HI> Age is in the way, for
<HI>thou</HI> acknowledge&s;t, that <HI>thou</HI> art four and twenty
Years old; and that <HI>thou</HI> wa&s;t the Younge&s;t of three
of <HI>thy</HI> Mother's Children; &s;o that, by <HI>thy</HI> Account,
<HI>thy</HI> Mother mu&s;t be extremely young, or this La|dy
cannot be <HI>thy</HI> Mother; for <HI>thou</HI> &s;ee&s;t, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI>
and any one may &s;ee, &s;he is but a young Woman
now, and cannot be &s;uppos'd to be above Forty
Years old, if &s;he is &s;o much, and is now big with-Child
at her going into the Country; &s;o that I
cannot give any Credit to <HI>thy</HI> Notion of her being
<HI>thy</HI> Mother; and if I might coun&s;el thee, it &s;hou'd
be to give-over that Thought, as an improbable
Story that does but &s;erve to di&s;order <HI>thee,</HI> and di|&s;turb
<HI>thy</HI> Head for, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> I perceive <HI>thou</HI> art
much di&s;turb'd indeed.</P>
<P>But this was all nothing: She cou'd be &s;atis|fy'd
with nothing but &s;eeing me; but the QU A|KER
defended her&s;elf very well, and in&s;i&s;ted on
it, that &s;he cou'd not: give her any Account of
me and finding her &s;till importunate, &s;he affected
at la&s;t, being a little di&s;gu&s;ted that &s;he &s;hou'd not
believe her, <HI>and added,</HI> That indeed, if &s;he had
known where I was gone, &s;he wou'l not have gi|ven
any-one an Account of it, unle&s;s I had given
<PB N="380" REF="385">
her Orders to do &s;o; but &s;eeing &s;he has not ac|quainted
me, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> where &s;he is gone, 'tis an
Intimation to me, &s;he was not de&s;irous it &s;hou'd
be publickly known and with this &s;he ri&s;e up,
which was as plain a de&s;iring her to ri&s;e up too,
and be gone, as cou'd be expre&s;s'd, except the
downright &s;howing her the Door.</P>
<P>Well, the Girl rejected all this, <HI>and told her,</HI>
She cou'd not indeed expect that &s;he (<HI>the</HI> QUA|KER)
&s;hou'd be affected with the Story &s;he had
told her, however moving; or that &s;he &s;hou'd take
any Pity on her: That it was her Misfortune,
that when &s;he was at the Hou&s;e before, and in the
Room with me, &s;he did not beg to &s;peak a Word
with me in private, or throw her&s;elf upon the
Floor, at my Feet, and claim what the Affection
of a Mother wou'd have done for her but &s;ince
&s;he had &s;lipped her Opportunity, &s;he wou'd wait
for another; that &s;he found by her (<HI>the Quaker's</HI>)
Talk, that &s;he had not quite left her Lodgings,
but was gone into the Country, <HI>&s;he &s;uppos'd,</HI> for
the Air; and &s;he was re&s;olv'd &s;he wou'd take &s;o
much <HI>Knight-Errantry</HI> upon her, that &s;he wou'd vi&s;it
all the Airing-Places in the Nation, and even all
the Kingdom over, ay, and <HI>Holland</HI> too, but &s;he
wou'd find me; for &s;he was &s;atisfy'd &s;he cou'd &s;o
convince me that &s;he was my own Child, that I
wou'd not deny it; and &s;he was &s;ure I was &s;o ten|der
and compa&s;&s;ionate, I wou'd not let her peri&s;h
after I was convinced that, &s;he was my own Fle&s;h
and Blood and in &s;aying &s;he wou'd vi&s;it all the
Airing-Places in <HI>England,</HI> &s;he reekon'd them all up
by Name, and began with <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> the very
Place I was gone to; then reckoning up <HI>Fp&s;om,
North-Hall, Barnet, Newmarket, Bury,</HI> and at la&s;t,
The Bath: And with this &s;he took her Leave.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="386">
My, faithful Agent the QUAKER, &s;ail'd not
to write to me immediately; but as &s;he was a
cunning, as well as an hone&s;t Woman, it pre&s;ent|ly
occurred to her, that this was a Story, which,
$word$ True or Fal&s;e, was not very fit to
$word$ to my Husband's Knowledge that as &s;he
$word$ not know what I might have been, or might
have been call'd in former Times, and how far
there might have been <HI>&s;omething</HI> or <HI>nothing</HI> in it,
&s;o &s;he thought if it was a Secret, I ought to have
the telling it my &s;elf; and if it was not, it might
as well, be public afterwards, as now; and that,
<HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> &s;he ought to leave it where &s;he found it,
and not hand it forwards to any-body without my
Con&s;ent: The&s;e prudent Mea&s;ures were inexpre&s;|&s;ibly
kind, as well as &s;ea&s;onable; for it had been
likely enough that her Letter might have come
publickly to me, and tho' my Husband wou'd
not have open'd it, yet it wou'd have look'd a
little odd that I &s;hou'd conceal its Contents from
him, when I had pretended &s;o much to commu|nicate
all my Affairs.</P>
<P>In Con&s;equence of this wi&s;e Caution, my good
Friend only wrote me in few Words, That the
impertinent Young-Woman had been with her,
as &s;he expected &s;he wou'd and that &s;he thought
it wou'd be very convenient that, if I cou'd &s;pare
<HI>Cherry,</HI> I wou'd &s;end her up, (meaning <HI>Amy</HI>) be|cau&s;e
&s;he found there might be &s;ome Occa&s;ion for
her.</P>
<P>As it happen'd, this Letter was enclosed to <HI>Amy</HI>
her&s;elf, and not &s;ent by the Way I had at fir&s;t or|der'd;
but it came &s;afe to my Hands; and tho'
I was allarm'd a little at it, yet I was not ac|quainted
with the Danger I was in of an imme|diate
Vi&s;it from this teizing Creature, till after|wards;
and I run a greater Ri&s;que indeed, than
<PB N="382" REF="387">
ordinary, in that I did not &s;end <HI>Amy</HI> up under
thirteen or fourteen Days, believing my&s;elf as

<P>But the Concern my faithful SPY, (<HI>for &s;uch my</HI>

Sagacity</HI>) I &s;ay, her Concern for me, was my Safety
in this Exigence,, when I was, <HI>as it were,</HI> keeping
no Guard for my&s;elf; for finding <HI>Amy</HI> not come
up, and that &s;he did not know how &s;oon this wild
Thing might put her de&s;ign'd Ramble in Practice,
&s;he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to the Captain's Wife's Hou&s;e,
where &s;he lodg'd, to tell her that &s;he wanted to
&s;peak with her: She was at the Heels of the Me&s;|&s;enger,
and came eager for &s;ome News; and
hon'd, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> the Lady, (<HI>meaning me</HI>) had been
come to Town.</P>
<P>The QUAKER, with as much Caution as &s;he
was Mi&s;tre&s;s of, <HI>not to tell a downright Lye,</HI> made
her believe &s;he expected to hear of me very quick|ly,
and frequently <HI>by the by,</HI> &s;peaking of being A|broad
to take the Air, talk'd of the Country about
<HI>Bury,</HI> how plea&s;ant it was how whole&s;ome; and
how fine an Air: How the <HI>Downs</HI> about Newmar|ket
were exceeding fine; and what a va&s;t deal of
Company there was, now the <HI>Court</HI> was there; till
at la&s;t, the Girl began to conclude, that <HI>my Lady|&s;hip</HI>
was gone thither; for, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> She knew I
lov'd to &s;ee a great-deal of Company.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays my Friend, thou</HI> tak'&s;t me wrong, I
did not &s;ugge&s;t, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> that the Per&s;on <HI>thou</HI> en|quir$&s;t
after, is gone thither, neither do I believe
&s;he is, I a&s;&s;ure thee; Well, the Girl &s;mil'd, and
let her know, that &s;he believ'd it for-all that; &s;o,
to clench it fa&s;t, Verily <HI>&s;ays &s;he, with great Seriou&s;|ne&s;s,
Thou</HI> do'&s;t not do well, for <HI>thou</HI> &s;u&s;pecte&s;t
every-thing, and believe&s;t nothing: I &s;peak &s;o|lemnly
<PB N="383" REF="388">
to <HI>thee,</HI> that I do not believe they are gone
that Way; &s;o if <HI>thou giv'&s;t thy&s;elf</HI> the Trouble
to go that Way, and art di&s;appointed, do not
&s;ay that I have deceiv'd <HI>thee:</HI> She knew well e|nough,
that if this did abate her; Su&s;picion, it
would not remove it; and that it wou'd do little
more than amu&s;e her; but by this &s;he kept her in
&s;u&s;pence till <HI>Amy</HI> came up, and that was enough.</P>
<P>When <HI>Amy</HI> came up, &s;he was quite confounded,
to hear the Relation which, the QUAKER gave
her, and found means to acquaint me of it; only
letting me know, to my great Satisfaction, that
&s;he wou'd not come to <HI>Tunbridge</HI> fir&s;t; but that
&s;he wou'd certainly go to <HI>Newmarket</HI> or <HI>Bury</HI> fir&s;t.</P>
<P>However, it gave me very great Unea&s;ine&s;s;
for as &s;he re&s;olv'd to ramble in &s;earch after me,
over the whole Country, I was &s;afe no-where, no,
not in <HI>Holland</HI> it&s;elf; &s;o indeed, I did not know
what to do with her: And thus I had a <HI>Bitter</HI> in
all my <HI>Sweet,</HI> for I was continually perplex'd with
this Hu&s;&s;y, and thought &s;he haunted me like an
Evil Spirit.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Amy</HI> was next-door to &s;tark|mad
about her; &s;he dur&s;t not &s;ee her at my Lodg|ings,
for Life; and &s;he went Days without
Number, to <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> where &s;he us'd to come,
and to her &s;ormer Lodging, and cou'd never
meet with her; at <HI>length,</HI> &s;he took up a mad Re&s;o|lution,
that &s;he wou'd go directly to the Captain's
Hou&s;e in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and &s;peak with her; it was a
mad Step, <HI>that's true,</HI> but, <HI>as</HI> Amy <HI>&s;aid,</HI> &s;he was
mad, &s;o nothing &s;he cou'd do, cou'd be other|wi&s;e
For if <HI>Amy</HI> had found her at <HI>Redriff,</HI> &s;he
(<HI>the Girl</HI>) wou'd have concluded pre&s;ently, that the
QUAKER had given her Notice, and &s;o that we
were all of a Knot, and that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> all &s;he had
&s;aid was right: But as it happen'd, things came to
<PB N="384" REF="389">
hit better than we expected; for that <HI>Amy</HI> going
out of a Coach, to take Water at <HI>Tower-Wharf,</HI>
meets <HI>the Girl</HI> ju&s;t come on-Shoar, having cro&s;s'd
the Water from Redriff: <HI>Amy</HI> made as if &s;he
wou'd have pa&s;s'd by her, tho' they met &s;o full
that &s;he did not pretend &s;he did not &s;ee her, for
&s;he looked fairly upon her fir&s;t; but then turning
her Head away, with, a Slight, offer'd to go from
her; but the Girl &s;topp'd, and &s;poke fir&s;t, and
made &s;ome Manners to her.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> &s;poke coldly to her, and a little angry;
and after &s;ome Words, &s;tanding in the Street, or
Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>the Girl &s;aying,</HI> &s;he &s;eem'd to be angry,
and wou'd not Have &s;poken to her: <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays
<HI>Amy, How tan you expect I &s;hou'd have any-more
to &s;ay to you, after I had done &s;o much for you, and
you have b$hav'd &s;o to me?</HI> The Girl &s;cem'd to take
no Notice of that now, but an&s;wer'd, <HI>I was going
to wait on you now:</HI> Wait on me! <HI>&s;ays Amy;</HI> what
do you mean by that? Why, <HI>&s;ays &s;he again, with a
kind of Familiarity,</HI> I was going to your Lodgings.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> was provok'd to the la&s;t Degree at her,
and yet &s;he thought it was not her time to re&s;ent,
becau&s;e &s;he had tit more fatal and wicked De&s;ign
in her Head, again&s;t her; which indeed, I never
knew till after it was executed, nor dur&s;t <HI>Amy</HI> ever
communicate it to me; for as I had always ex|pre&s;s'd
my&s;elf vehemently again&s;t hurting a Hair
of her Head, &s;o &s;he was re&s;olv'd to take her own
Mea&s;ures, without con&s;ulting me any-more.</P>
<P>In order to this, <HI>Amy</HI> gave her good Words,
and conceal'd her Re&s;entment as much as &s;he cou'd;
and when &s;he talk'd of going to her Lodging, <HI>Amy</HI>
&s;mi'd, and &s;ald, nothing, but call'd for a Pair of
Oars to go to Greenwich; and ask'd her, &s;eeing <HI>&s;he
&s;aid</HI> &s;he was going to her Lodging, to go along
with her, for &s;he was going Home, and was all|alone.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="390">
<HI>Amy</HI> did this with &s;uch a Stock of A&s;&s;urance,
that the Girl was confounded, and knew not what
to &s;ay; but the more &s;he he&s;itated, the more <HI>Amy</HI>
pre&s;'d her to go; and talking very kindly to her,
<HI>told her,</HI> If &s;he did not go to &s;ee her Lodgings, &s;he
might go to keep her Company, and &s;he wou'd pay
a Boat to bring her back-again; &s;o, <HI>in a word, Amy</HI>
prevailed on her to go into the Boat with her,
and carry'd her down to Greenwich.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, that <HI>Amy</HI> had no more Bu&s;ine&s;s at
<HI>Greenwich</HI> than I had nor was &s;he going thither;
but we were all hamper'd to the la&s;t Degree, with
the Impertinence of this Creature and in particu|lar,
I was horribly perplex'd with it.</P>
<P>As they were in the Boat, <HI>Amy</HI> began to re|proach
Her with Ingratitude, in treating her &s;o
rudely, who had done &s;o much for her, and been
&s;o kind to her; and to ask her what &s;he had got
by it? or what &s;he expected to get? T'hen came
in my Share, the Lady <HI>Roxana; Amy</HI> je&s;ted with
that, and banter'd her a little <HI>and ask'd her,</HI> if &s;he
had found her yet?</P>
<P>But <HI>Amy</HI> was both &s;urpriz'd and curag'd, when
the Girl told her roundly, That &s;he thank'd her
for what &s;he had done for her; but that &s;he wou'd
not have her think &s;he was &s;o ignorant, as not to
know that what &s;he [<HI>Amy</HI>] had done, was by her
Mother's Order; and who &s;he was beholden to for
it: That &s;he cou'd never make In&s;truments pa&s;s
for Principals, and pay the Debt to the Agent,
when the Obligation was all to the Original: That
&s;he knew well enough who &s;he was, and who &s;he
was employ'd by: That &s;he knew the Lady&mdash;
very well, (<HI>naming the Name that I now went by</HI>)
which, was my Husband's true Name, and by
which &s;he might know whether &s;he had found out
her Mother or no.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="391">
<HI>Amy</HI> wi&s;h her at the Bottom of the <HI>Thames;</HI>
and had there been no Watermen in the Boat, and
no-body in &s;ight, <HI>&s;he $word$ to me,</HI> &s;he wou'd have
thrown her into the River: I was horribly di|&s;turb'd
when &s;he told me this Story, and began to
think this wou'd, at la&s;t, all end in my Run; but
when <HI>Amy</HI> &s;poke of throwing her into the River,
and drowning her, I was &s;o provok'd at her, that
all my Rage turn'd again&s;t Amy, and I fell tho|rowly
out with her: I had now kept <HI>Amy</HI> almo&s;t
thirty Year, and found her on all Occa&s;ions, the
faithfule&s;t Creacure to me, that ever Woman had;
I &s;ay, faithful to me; for however wicked &s;he
was, &s;till &s;he was true to me; and even this Rage
of her$ was all upon my Account, and for &s;car
any Mi&s;clne&s; &s;hou'd be&s;al me.</P>
<P>But be that how it wou'd, I cou'd not bear the
Mention of her Murthering the poor Girl, and
it put me &s;o be&s;ide my&s;elf, that I ri&s;e up in a
Rage, and bade her get out of my Sight, and out
of my Hou&s;e; <HI>told her,</HI> I had kept her too long,
and that I wou'd never &s;ee her Fa$e more; I had
before told her, That &s;he was a Murtherer,, and a
bloody-minded Creature; that &s;he cou'd not but
knew that I cou'd not bear the Thought of it,
much le&s;s the Mention of it; and that it was
the impudence$ &s;t Thing that ever was known, to
make &s;uch a Propo&s;al to me, when &s;he $word$ that
I was really the Mother of this Girl, and that &s;he
was my own Child; that it wicked enough
in her; but that &s;he mu&s;t conclude I was ten times
wic$eder than her&s;elf, if I cou'd come into it:
That the Girl was in the right and I had nothing
to blame her for; but that it was owing to the
Wickedne&s;s of my $ife, that made it nece&s;&s;ary
for me to keep her from a Di&s;covery; but that I
wou'd not murther my Child, tho' I was otherwi&s;e

and &s;hort, Would I not, but &s;he wou'd, <HI>&s;he &s;aid;</HI>
if &s;he had an Opportunity: And upon the&s;e Words
it was that I bade Her get out of my Sight, and
out of my Hou&s;e; and it went &s;o far, that <HI>Amy</HI>
pack'd up her Alls, and march'd off, and was gone
for almo&s;t good-and-all: <HI>But of that in its Order;
I mu&s;t go back to her Relation of the Voyage which they
made to</HI> Greenwich <HI>together.</HI></P>
<P>They held on the Wrangle all-the-way by Wa|ter;
the Girl in&s;i&s;ted upon her knowing that I
was her Mother, and told her all the Hi&s;tory of
my Life in the <HI>Pallmall,</HI> as well after her being
turn'd away, as before; and of my Marriage &s;ince;
and which was wor&s;e, not only who my pre&s;ent
Husband was, but where he had liv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Roan</HI>
in <HI>France;</HI> &s;he knew nothing of <HI>Paris,</HI> or of where
we was going to live, <HI>Namely,</HI> at <HI>Nimuegen; but

find me here, &s;he would go to <HI>Holland</HI> after
me.</P>
<P>They landed at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and <HI>Amy</HI> carried her
into the Park with her, and they walk'd above
two Hours there, in the farthe&s;t and remote&s;t
Walks; which <HI>Amy</HI> did, becau&s;e as they talk'd,
with great heat, it was apparent they were quar|relling,
and the People took Notice of it.</P>

wou'd go no farther; <HI>but &s;aid,</HI> She wou'd not go
in there.</P>
<P><HI>Amy</HI> &s;mil'd, and ask'd her what was the Mat|ter?
<HI>She replied &s;hort,</HI> She did not know where &s;he
was, nor where &s;he was going to carry her, and &s;he
wou'd go no farther; and without any-move Ce|remony,

$emony, turns back, and walks apace away from
her: <HI>Amy</HI> own'd &s;he was &s;urpriz'd, and came back
too, and call'd to her; upon which the Girl &s;topt,
and <HI>Amy</HI> coming up to her, ask'd her, what &s;he
meant?</P>
<P><HI>The Girl boldly replied,</HI> She did not know but &s;he
might murther her; and that, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> She wou'd
not tru&s;t her&s;elf with her; and never wou'd come
into her Company again, alone.</P>
<P>It was very provoking; but however, <HI>Amy</HI> kept
her Temper, with much Difficulty, and bore it,
knowing that much, might depend upon it; &s;o &s;he
mock'd her fooli&s;h Jealou&s;ie, <HI>and told her,</HI> She need
not be unea&s;ie for her, &s;he wou'd do her no Harm,
and wou'd have done her Good, if &s;he wou'd
have let her; but &s;ince &s;he was of &s;uch a refractory
Humour, &s;he &s;hou'd not trouble her&s;elf, for &s;he
&s;hou'd never come into her Company again; and
that neither &s;he, or her Brother, or Si&s;ter, &s;hou'd
ever hear from her, or &s;ee her any-more; and &s;o
&s;he &s;hou'd have the Satisfaction of being the Ruin
of her Brother and Si&s;ter, as well as of her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Girl &s;eem'd a little mollifi'd at that, <HI>and
&s;aid,</HI> That for her&s;elf, &s;he knew the wor&s;t of it,
&s;he cou'd &s;eek her Fortune; but 'twas hard her
Brother and Si&s;ter &s;hou'd &s;uffer on her Score;
and &s;aid &s;omething that was tender, and well e|nough,
on that Account: <HI>But Amy told her,</HI> It
was for her to take that into Consideration; for
&s;he wou'd let her &s;ee, that it was all her own,
that &s;he wou'd have done them all Good, but
that having been us'd thus, &s;he wou'd do no more
for any of them; and that &s;he &s;hou'd not need to
be afraid to come into her Company again, for
&s;he wou'd never give her Occa&s;ion for it any-more;
<HI>by the way,</HI> was fal&s;e in <HI>the Girl</HI> too, for &s;he did venture into <HI>Amy's</HI> Company again after that, once too
much; <HI>as I &s;hall relate by it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="394">
They grew cooler however, afterwards, and
<HI>Amy</HI> carry'd her into a Hou&s;e at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where
&s;he was acquainted, and took an Occa&s;ion to leave
the Girl in a Room a-while, to &s;peak to the People
in the Hou&s;e, and &s;o prepare them to own her as
a Lodger in the Hou&s;e; and then going in to her
again, <HI>told her,</HI> There &s;he lodg'd, if &s;he had a|mind

any-thing to &s;ay to her and &s;o <HI>Amy</HI> di&s;mi&s;s'd
her, and got rid of her again; and finding an
empty Hackney-Coach in the Town, came away
by Land to <HI>London,</HI> and the Girl going down to
the Water-&s;ide, came by Boat.</P>
<P>This Conver&s;ation did not an&s;wer <HI>Amy's</HI> End
at-all, becau&s;e it did not &s;ecure the Girl from
pur&s;uing her De&s;ign of hunting me out; and tho'
my indefatigable Friend the QUAKER, amus'd
her three or four Days, yet I had &s;uch Notice of
it at la&s;t, that I thought fit to come away from
<HI>Tunbridge</HI> upon it, and where to go, I knew not;
but, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> I went to a little Village upon <HI>Epping-Fare&s;t,</HI>
call'd <HI>Woodford,</HI> and took Lodgings in a
Private Hou&s;e, where I liv'd retir'd about &s;ix
Weeks, till I thought &s;he might be tir'd of her
Search, and have given me over.</P>
<P>Here I received an Account from my tru&s;ty QUA|KER,
that <HI>the Wench</HI> had really been at <HI>Tunbridge;</HI>
had found out my Lodgings; and had told her Tale
there in a mo&s;t di&s;mal Tone that &s;he had &s;ollow'd
us as &s;he thought, to <HI>London;</HI> but the QUAKER
had an&s;wer'd her, That &s;he knew nothing or it,
which was indeed true and had admoni&s;h$d her
to be ea&s;ie and not hunt after People of &s;uch
Fa&s;hion as we were, as if we were Thieve; that
&s;he might ha a&s;&s;ur'd, that &s;ince I was not willing
to &s;ee her, I wou'd not be forc'd to it; an treat|ing
me thus wou'd effectually di&s;oblige me: And
<PB N="390" REF="395">
And with &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es as the&s;e &s;he quieted her;
and <HI>&s;he</HI> (the QUAKER) <HI>added,</HI> that &s;he hop'd
I &s;hou'd not be troubl'd much more with her.</P>
<P>It was in this time that <HI>Amy</HI> gave me the Hi|&s;tory
of her <HI>Greenwich Voyage,</HI> when &s;he &s;poke of
drowning and killing the Girl, in &s;o &s;erious a man|ner,
and with &s;uch an apparent Re&s;olution of do|ing
it, that, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> put me in a Rage with her,
&s;o that I effectually turn'd her away from me, <HI>as I
have &s;aid above;</HI> and &s;he was gone; nor did &s;he &s;o
much as tell me whither, or which Way &s;he was
gone; on the other-hand, when I came to re|flect
on it, that now I had neither A&s;&s;i&s;tant or
Confident to &s;peak to, or receive the lea&s;t Infor|mation
from, <HI>my Friend the</HI> QUAKER <HI>excepted,</HI> it,
made me very unea&s;ie.</P>
<P>I waited, and expected, and wonder'd, from
Day to Day, &s;till thinking <HI>Amy</HI> wou'd one time or
other, think a little, and come again, or <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI>
let me hear of her; but for ten Days together I
heard nothing of her; I was &s;o impatient, that
I got neither Re&s;t by Day, or Sleep by Night,
and what to do I knew not; I dur&s;t not go to
Town to the QUAKER'S, for fear of meeting that
vexatious Creature, <HI>my Girl,</HI> and I cou'd get no In|telligence,
where I was; &s;o I got my Spou&s;e, upon
Pretence of wanting her Company, to take the
Coach one Day, and fetch my good QUAKER to me.</P>
<P>When I had her, I dur&s;t ask her no Que&s;tions,
nor hardly knew which End of the Bu&s;ine&s;s to be|gin
to talk of; but of her own accord <HI>&s;he told me,</HI>
that the Girl had been three or four times haunt|ing
her, for News from me; and that &s;he had
been &s;o trouble&s;ome, that &s;he had been oblig'd
to &s;how her&s;elf a little angry with her, and <HI>at la&s;t,</HI>
told her plainly, that &s;he need give her&s;elf no Trou|ble
in &s;earching after me, by her means; for &s;he
<PB N="391" REF="396">
(<HI>the</HI> QUAKER) wou'd not tell her, if &s;he knew;
upon which &s;he refrain'd a-while: But on the
other-hand, <HI>&s;he told me,</HI> it was not &s;a$e for me to
&s;end my own Coach for her to come in; for the
had $ome Rea$on to believe, that <HI>&s;he,</HI> (<HI>my Daugh|ter</HI>)
$word$ her Door Night and Day, <HI>nay,</HI> and
watch'd her too every time &s;he went in and out;
for &s;he was &s;o bent upon a Di&s;covery, that &s;he
&s;par'd no Pains; and &s;he believ'd &s;he had taken a
Lodging very near their Hou&s;e, for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I could hardly give her a Hearing of all this,
for my $word$ to ask for <HI>Amy;</HI> but I was con|founded
when &s;he told me &s;he had heard nothing
of her; $word$ impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the anxious
Thoughts that rowl'd about in my Mind, and
continually perplex'd me about her; particularly, I
reproach'd my&s;elf with my Ra&s;hne&s;s, in turning
away &s;o faithful a Creature, that for &s;o many Years
had not only been a Servant, but an Agent; and
not only an Agent, but a Friend, and a faithful
Friend too.</P>
<P>Then I con&s;ider'd too, that <HI>Amy</HI> knew all the
Secret Hi&s;tory of my Life; had been in all the In|triegues
of it, and been a Party in both Evil and
Good, and at be&s;t, there was no Policy in it;
that <HI>as</HI> it was very ungenerous and unkind, to
run Things to &s;uch an Extremity with her, and
for an Occa&s;ion too, in which all the Fault &s;he
was guilty of, was owing to her Exce&s;s of Ca$e
for my Safety; <HI>&s;o</HI> it mu&s;t be only her &s;teddy
Kindne&s;s to me, and an exce&s;s of Generous Friend|&s;hip
for me, that &s;hou'd keep her from ill-u&s;ing
me in return or it; which ill-u&s;ing me was enough
in her Power, and might be my utter Undoing.</P>
<P>The&s;e Thoughts perplex'd me exceedingly; and
what Cour&s;e to take, I really did not know; I be|gan
indeed, to give <HI>Amy</HI> quite over, for &s;he had
<PB N="392" REF="397">
now been gone above a Fortnight; and as &s;he had
taken away all her Cloaths, and her Money too,
<HI>which was not a little,</HI> and &s;o had no Occa&s;ion of
that kind, to come any-more, &s;o &s;he had not left
any word where &s;he was gone, or to which Part of
the World I might &s;end to hear of her.</P>
<P>And I was troubl'd on another Account too, <HI>viz.</HI>
That my Spou&s;e and I too had re&s;olv'd to do very
hand&s;omely for <HI>Amy,</HI> without con&s;idering what
&s;he might have got another way at-all; but we had
&s;aid nothing of it to her; and &s;o I thought, as
&s;he had not known what was likely to fall in her
way, &s;he had not the Influence of that Expectation
to make her come back.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Perplexity of this Girl,
who hunted me, as if, <HI>like a Hound,</HI> &s;he had had
a hot Scent, but was now at a Fault; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> that
Perplexity, and this other Part, of <HI>Amy</HI> being
gone, i&s;&s;ued in this, I re&s;olv'd to be gone, and go
over to <HI>Holland;</HI> there I believ'd, I &s;hou'd be at
re&s;t: So I took Occa&s;ion one-Day to tell my
Spou&s;e, that I was afraid he might take it ill that
I had amus'd him thus long, and that, <HI>at la&s;t,</HI> I
doubted I was not with-Child; and that &s;ince it
was &s;o, our Things being pack'd-up, and all in order
for going to <HI>Holland,</HI> I wou'd go away now, when
he pleas'd.</P>
<P>My Spou&s;e, who was perfectly ca&s;$e, whether
in going or &s;taying, left it all entirely to me; &s;o I
con&s;ider'd of it, and began to prepare again for
my Voyage; but alas! I was irre&s;olute to the la&s;t
Degree; I was, for want of <HI>Amy,</HI> $word$; I had
lo&s;t my Right-Hand; &s;he was my Steward, ga|ther'd
in my Rents, <HI>I mean my Intere&s;t-Money,</HI> and
kept my Accompts, and, <HI>in a word,</HI> did all my Bu|&s;ine&s;s;
and without her, <HI>indeed,</HI> I knew not how
to go away, nor how to &s;tay: But an Accident
<PB N="393" REF="398">
thru&s;t it&s;elf in here, and that even in <HI>Amy's</HI> Con|duct
too, which frighted me away, and without her
too, in the utmo&s;t Horror and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have related how my faithful Friend the
QUAKER, was come to me, and what Account
&s;he gave me of her being continually haunted by
my Daughter; and that, <HI>as &s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he watch'd
her very Door, Night and Day; <HI>the Truth was,</HI> &s;he
had &s;et a SPY to watch &s;o effectually, that &s;he
(<HI>the</HI> QUARER) neither went in or out, but &s;he
had Notice of it.</P>
<P>This was too evident, when the next Morning
after &s;he came to me, (<HI>for I kept her all-Night</HI>) to
my un&s;peakable Surprize, I &s;aw a Hackney-Coach
&s;top at the Door where I lodg'd, and &s;aw her (<HI>my
Daughter</HI>) in the Coach all-along: It was a very
good Chance in the middle of a bad one, that my
Husband had taken out the Coach that very Morn|ing,
and was gone to <HI>London;</HI> as for me, I had
neither Life or Soul left in me; I was &s;o confounded,
I knew not what to do, or to &s;ay.</P>
<P>My <HI>happy Vi&s;itor</HI> had more Pre&s;ence of Mind
than I; <HI>and ask'd me,</HI> If I had made no Acquain|tance
among the Neighbours? <HI>I told her,</HI> Yes, there
was a Lady lodg'd two Doors off, that I was very
intimate with; but ha&s;t <HI>thou</HI> no Way out backward
to go to her? <HI>&s;ays &s;he:</HI> Now it happen'd there was
a Back-Door in the Garden, by which we u&s;ually
went and came to and from the Hou&s;e; &s;o I told
her of it: Well, well, &s;ays &s;he, <HI>Go out and make a
Vi&s;it then, and leave the re&s;t to me:</HI> Away I run;
told the Lady, (for I was very free there) that I
was a Widow to-Day, my Spou&s;e being gone to
<HI>London,</HI> &s;o I came not to vi&s;it her, but to dwell
with her that Day; becau&s;e al&s;o, our Landlady
had got Strangers come from <HI>London:</HI> So having
fram'd this orderly LYE, I pull'd &s;ome Work
<PB N="394" REF="399">
out of my Pocket, <HI>and added,</HI> I did not come to
be Idle.</P>
<P>As I went out one-way, my Friend the QUAKER
went the other, to receive this unwelcome Gue&s;t:
The Girl made but little Ceremony; but having
bid the Coachman $word$ at the Gate, gets down, out
of the Coach, and comes to the Door; a Count|ry-Girl
going to the Door, (belonging to the
Hou&s;e) for the QUAKER forbid any of my
Maids going: <HI>Madam</HI> ask'd for my QUAKER by
Name; and the Girl ask'd her to walk in.</P>
<P>Upon this, my QUAKER &s;eeing there was no
hanging-back, goes to her immediately, but put
on all the Gravity upon her Countenance, that &s;he
was Mi&s;tre&s;s of; and that was not a little $word$.</P>
<P>When &s;he (<HI>the</HI> QUAKER) came into the Room,
(<HI>for they had &s;how'd my Daughter into a little Par|lour</HI>)
&s;he kept her grave Countenance, but &s;aid not
a Word; nor did <HI>my Daughter</HI> &s;peak a good-|while;
but after &s;ome time, <HI>my Girl</HI> began, <HI>and
said,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you know me, Madam.</P>

Here the Girl importun'd her again, with the

that my poor QUAKER was &s;often'd with it,
and began to per&s;wade me to con&s;ider of it, and

and hear what &s;he had to &s;ay; but this was
afterwards: <HI>I return to the Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The QUAKER was perplex'd with her a long
time; &s;he talk'd of &s;ending back the Coach, and
lying in the Town all-Night: This my Friend
knew wou'd be very unea&s;ie to me, but &s;he dur&s;t
not &s;peak a Word again&s;t it; but on a &s;udden
Thought, &s;he offer'd a bold Stroke, which tho'
dangerous if it had happen'd wrong, had its de|&s;ir'd
Effect.</P>
<P><HI>She told her,</HI> That as for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her Coach,
that was as &s;he pleas'd; &s;he believ'd, &s;he wou'd
not ea&s;ily get a Lodging in the Town; but that

of the Hou&s;e, that if they had room, &s;he might
have a Lodging there for one Night, rather than
be forc'd back to <HI>London,</HI> before &s;he was free to
go.</P>
<P>This was a cunning, tho' a dangerous Step, and
it &s;ucceeded accordingly, for it amus'd the Creature
entirely, and &s;he pre&s;ently concluded, that really
I cou'd not be there then; otherwi&s;e &s;he wou'd
never have ask'd her to lie in the Hou&s;e $word$ &s;he
grew cold again pre&s;ently, as to her lodging there;
<HI>and &s;aid, No,</HI> &s;ince it was &s;o, She wou'd go back

<P>She &s;aid little to that, except that, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> &s;he

mi&s;taken; and &s;he (<HI>the</HI> QUAKER) &s;hou'd watch
her&s;elf, very narrowly; or &s;he might one time or
other get &s;ome Intelligence from her, whether &s;he
wou'd or no; and &s;he was &s;atisfy'd &s;he had gain'd
&s;ome of her by this Journey; for that if I was not in
the Hou&s;e, I was not far off; and if I did not remove
very quickly, &s;he wou'd find me out: Very well,

to &s;ee <HI>thee, thou</HI> giv'&s;t me Notice to tell her, that
&s;he may get out out of <HI>thy</HI> Way.</P>
<P>She flew out in a Rage at that, <HI>and told my Friend,</HI>

Children after her; and denounc'd &s;uch horrid
things upon her, as frighted the poor tender-heart|ed

Temper, than ever I &s;aw her before; so that &s;he
re&s;olv'd to go home the next Morning; and I,

however, upon &s;econd Thoughts, I did not; but

for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>I &s;tay'd there about a Fortnight, and in all that

a Letter from my QUAKER, intimating, that &s;he
had &s;omething of moment to &s;ay, that &s;he cou'd not
communicate by a Letter, but wi&s;h'd I wou'd give
my&s;elf the Trouble to come up; directing me to
come with the Coach into <HI>Goodman's-Fields,</HI> and
then walk to her Back-Door on-foot, which being
left open on purpo&s;e, the watchful Lady, if &s;he
had any Spies, could not well &s;ee me.</P>

<P>I was &s;truck as with a Bla&s;t from Heaven, at

&s;he haunted my Imagination, if &s;he did not haunt
the Hou&s;e; my Fancy &s;how'd her me in a hun|dred
Shapes and Po&s;tures; &s;leeping or waking, &s;he
was with me: Sometimes I thought I &s;aw her
with her Throat cut; &s;ometimes with her Head
cut, and her Brains knock'd-out; other-times
hang'd up upon a Beam; another time drown'd
in the Great Pond at <HI>Camberwell:</HI> And all the&s;e
Appearances were terrifying to the la&s;t Degree;
and that which was &s;till wor&s;e, I cou'd really
hear nothing of her: I &s;ent to the Captain's Wife
in <HI>Redriff, and &s;he an&s;wer'd me,</HI> She was gone to
her Relations in <HI>Spittle-Fields;</HI> I &s;ent thither, <HI>and
they &s;aid,</HI> &s;he was there about three Weeks ago;
but that &s;he went out in a Coach with the Gen|tlewoman
that us'd to be &s;o kind to her; but
whither &s;he was gone, they knew not; for &s;he
<PB N="402" REF="407">
had not been there &s;ince I &s;ent back the Me&s;&s;en|ger
for a De&s;cription of the Woman &s;he went
out with; and they de&s;crib'd her &s;o Perfectly,
that I knew it to be <HI>Amy,</HI> and none but <HI>$word$</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;ent word again,</HI> That Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> $word$ &s;he
went out with, left her in two or three Hou$$;
and that they &s;hou'd &s;earch for her, for I had rea|&s;on
to fear &s;he was Murther'd: This frighted them
all intollerably; they believ'd: <HI>Amy</HI> had carry'd
her to pay her a Sum of Money, and that &s;ome|body
had watch'd her after her having receiv'd it,
and had Robb'd and Murther'd her.</P>
<P>I believ'd nothing of that Part; but I believ'd as
it was, That whatever was done, <HI>Amy</HI> had done
it; and that, <HI>in &s;hort, Amy</HI> had made her away&punc;
and I believ'd it the more, becau&s;e <HI>Amy</HI> came no
more near me, but confirm'd her Guilt by her
Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I mourn'd thus for her, for
above a Month; but finding <HI>Amy</HI> &s;till come not
near me, and that I mu&s;t put my Affairs in a Po|&s;ture
that I might go to <HI>Holland,</HI> I open'd all my
Affairs to my dear tru&s;ty Friend, the QUAKER,
and plac'd her, in Matters of Tru&s;t, in the room of
<HI>Amy,</HI> and with a heavy, bleeding Heart for my
poor Girl, I embark'd with my Spou&s;e, and all
our Equipage and Goods, on-board another <HI>Hol|land's-Trader,</HI>
not a Packet-Boat, and went over
to <HI>Holland;</HI> where I arriv'd as I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t put in a Caution however, here, that
you mu&s;t not under&s;tand me as if I let my Friend
the QUAKER into any Part of the Secret Hi|&s;tory
of my former Li$e; nor did I commit the
Grand re&s;erv'd Article of all, to her, <HI>viz.</HI> That
I was really the Girl's Mother, and the Lady
<HI>Roxana;</HI> there was no need of that Part being
expos'd; and it was always a Maxim with me,
<PB N="403" REF="408">
<HI>That Secrets &s;hou'd never be open'd, without evident
&V;tility:</HI> It cou'd be of no manner of U&s;e to me,
or her, to communicate that Part to her, be&s;ides
&s;he was too hone&s;t her&s;elf, to make it &s;afe to me;
for tho' &s;he lov'd me very &s;incerely, and it was
plain, by many Circum&s;tances, that &s;he did &s;o;
yet &s;he wou'd not <HI>Lye</HI> for me upon Occa&s;ion, as
<HI>Amy</HI> wou'd, and therefore it was not advi&s;able on
any Terms to communicate that Part; for if the
Girl, or any one el&s;e, &s;hou'd have come to her af|terwards,
and put it home to her, Whether &s;he
knew that I was the Girl's Mother or not; or was
the &s;ame as the Lady <HI>Roxana,</HI> or not, &s;he either
wou'd not have denied it, or wou'd have done it
with &s;o ill a Grace, &s;uch Blu&s;hing, &s;uch He&s;itations,
and Faultrings in her An&s;wers, as wou'd have put
the Matter out of doubt, and betray'd her&s;elf
and the Secret too.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I did not di&s;cover any|thing
of that kind to her; but I plac'd her, <HI>as I
have &s;aid,</HI> in <HI>Amy</HI>'s &s;tead, in the other Affairs of
receiving Money, Intere&s;ts, Rents, <HI>and the like,</HI>
and &s;he was as faithful as <HI>Amy</HI> cou'd be, and as
diligent.</P>
<P>But there fell out a great Difficulty here, which
I knew not how to get over; and this was, how to
convey the u&s;ual Supply, or Provi&s;ion and Money,
to the Uncle and the other Si&s;ter, who depended,
e&s;pecially the Si&s;ter, upon the &s;aid Supply, for her
Support; and indeed, tho' <HI>Amy</HI> had &s;aid ra&s;hly,
that &s;he wou'd not take any more Notice of the
Si&s;ter, and wou'd leave her to peri&s;h, <HI>as above,</HI>
yet it was neither in my Nature, or <HI>Amy</HI>'s either,
much le&s;s was it in my De&s;ign; and therefore I
re&s;olv'd to leave the Management of what I had
re&s;erv'd for that Work, with my faithful QUAKER,
but how to direct her to manage them, was the great
Difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="409">
<HI>Amy</HI> had told them in &s;o many Words, That
&s;he was not their Mother, but that &s;he was the
Maid <HI>Amy,</HI> that carried them to their Aunt's;
that &s;he and their Mother went over to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI>
to &s;eek their Fortune, and that there good
Things had befallen them; and that their Mother
was very rich and happy; that &s;he (<HI>Amy</HI>) had
married in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but being now a Widow,
and re&s;olving to come over to <HI>England,</HI> their Mo|ther
had oblig'd her to enquire them out, and do
for them as &s;he had done; and that now &s;he was
re&s;olv'd to go back to the <HI>Indies</HI> again; but that
&s;he had Orders from their Mother to do very
hand&s;omely by them; and, <HI>in a word,</HI> told them,
She had 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a-piece for them, upon Condi|tion
that they prov'd &s;ober, and married &s;uitably
to them&s;elves, and did not throw them&s;elves away
upon Scoundrels.</P>
<P>The good Family in who&s;e Care they had been,
I had re&s;olv'd to take more than ordinary Notice
of; and <HI>Amy,</HI> by my Order, had acquainted them
with it, and oblig'd my Daughters to promi&s;e to
&s;ubmit to their Government, as formerly, and to
be rul'd by the hone&s;t Man, as by a Father and
Coun&s;ellor; and engag'd him to treat them as his
Children; and to oblige him effectually to take
Care of them, and to make his Old-Age comfort|able
both to him and his Wife, who had been &s;o
good to the Orphans: had order'd her to &s;ettle
the other 2000 <HI>I. that is to &s;ay,</HI> the Intere&s;t of it,
which was 120 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, upon them: to be theirs
for both their Lives; but to come to my two
Daughters after them: This was &s;o ju&s;t, $word$
was &s;o pr$$$ntly manag'd by <HI>Amy,</HI> that nothing
&s;he ever did for me, pleas'd me better: And in
this Po&s;ture, leaving my two Daughters with their
$word$ Friend, and &s;o coming away to me, (<HI>as they
<PB N="405" REF="410">
thought to the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies) &s;he had prepar'd every|thing
in order to her going over with me to <HI>Hol|land;</HI>
and in this Po&s;ture that Matter &s;tood when
that unhappy Girl, <HI>who I have &s;aid &s;o much of,</HI> broke
in upon all our Mea&s;ures, <HI>as you have heard;</HI> and
by an Ob&s;tinacy never to be conquer'd or pacify'd,
either with Threats or Per&s;wa&s;ions, pur&s;u'd her
Search after me (<HI>her Mother) as I have &s;aid,</HI> till &s;he
brought me even to the Brink of De&s;truction, and
wou'd, in all Probability, have trac'd me out at
la&s;t, if <HI>Amy</HI> had not by the Violence of her
Pa&s;&s;ion, and by a Way which I had no Know|ledge
of, and indeed abhorr'd, put a Stop to her;
of which I cannot enter into the Particulars here.</P>
<P>However, notwith&s;tanding this, I cou'd not
think of going away, and leaving this Work so
unfini&s;h'd as <HI>Amy</HI> had threatn'd to do, and for
the Folly of one Child, to leave the other to
&s;tarve; or to &s;top my determin'd Bounty to the
good Family I have mention'd: So, <HI>in a word,</HI> I
committed the fini&s;hing it all, to my faithful Friend
the QUAKER, to whom I communicated as much
of the old Story, as was needful to empower her to
perform what <HI>Amy</HI> had promis'd; and to make
her talk &s;o much to the Purpo&s;e, as one employ'd
more remotely than <HI>Amy</HI> had been, needed to do.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e, &s;he had fir&s;t of all a full Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Money; and went fir&s;t to the Ho|ne&s;t
Man and his Wife, and &s;ettl'd all the Matter
with them; when &s;he talk'd of Mrs. <HI>Amy,</HI> &s;he
talk'd of her as one that had been empower'd by
the Mother of the Girls, in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but was
oblig'd to go back to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and had &s;ettl'd all
&s;ooner, if &s;he had not been hinder'd by the ob&s;ti|nate
Humour of the other Daughter; that &s;he had
left In&s;tructions with her for the re&s;t; but that the
other had affronted her &s;o much, that &s;he was
<PB N="406" REF="411">
gone away without doing any-thing for her; and
that now, if any-thing was done, it mu&s;t be by
fre&s;h Orders from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I need not &s;ay how punctually my new Agent
acted; but which was more, <HI>&s;he</HI> brought the Old-Man
and his Wife, and my other Daughter, &s;everal
times to her Hou&s;e, by which I had an Opportu|nity,
<HI>being there only as a Lodger, and a Stranger,</HI> to
&s;ee my other Girl, which I had never done be|fore,
&s;ince &s;he was a little Child.</P>
<P>The Day I contriv'd to &s;ee them, I was dre&s;s'd-up
in a <HI>Quaker</HI>'s Habit, and look'd &s;o like a <HI>Quaker,</HI>
that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them, who had never
&s;een me before, to &s;uppo&s;e I had ever been anything
el&s;e; al&s;o my Way of talking was &s;uitable
enough to it, for I had learn'd that long before.</P>
<P>I have not Time here to take Notice what a
Surprize it was to me, to &s;ee my Child; how it
work'd upon my Affections; with what infinite
Struggle I ma&s;ter'd a &s;trong Inclination that I had
to di&s;cover my&s;elf to her; how the Girl was the
very Counterpart of my&s;elf, only much hand|&s;omer;
and how &s;weetly and mode&s;tly &s;he behav'd;
how on that Occa&s;ion I re&s;olv'd to do more for her,
than I had appointed by <HI>Amy, and the like.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis enough to mention here, that as the &s;et|ling
this Affair made Way for my going on-board,
notwith&s;tanding the Ab&s;ence of my old Agent
<HI>Amy;</HI> &s;o however, I left &s;ome Hints for <HI>Amy</HI> too,
for I did not yet de&s;pair of my hearing from her;
and that if my good QUAKER &s;hou'd ever &s;ee
her again, &s;he &s;hould let her &s;ee them; wherein
particularly ordering her to leave the Affair of
<HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> ju&s;t as I had done, in the Hands of
my Friend, &s;he &s;hou'd come away to me, upon
this Condition neverthele&s;s, that &s;he gave full Sa|tisfaction
to my Friend the QUAKER, that &s;he
<PB N="407" REF="412">
had not murther'd my Child; for if &s;he had, <HI>I told
her,</HI> I wou'd never &s;ee her Face more: How,
notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he came over afterwards,
without giving my Friend any of that Satisfaction,
or any Account that &s;he intended to come over.</P>
<P>I can &s;ay no more now, but that, <HI>as above,</HI> being
arriv'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> with my Spou&s;e and his Son,
<HI>formerly mention'd,</HI> I appear'd there with all the
Splendor and Equipage &s;uitable to our new Pro|&s;pect,
<HI>as I have already ob&s;erv'd.</HI></P>
<P>Here, after &s;ome few Years of flouri&s;hing, and
outwardly happy Circum&s;tances, I fell into a dread|ful
Cour&s;e of Calamities, and <HI>Amy</HI> al&s;o; the very
Rever&s;e of our former Good Days; the Bla&s;t of
Heaven &s;eem'd to follow the Injury done the poor
Girl, by us both; and I was brought &s;o low again,
that my Repentance &s;eem'd to be only the Con&s;e|quence
of my Mi&s;ery, as my Mi&s;ery was of my
Crime.</P>
