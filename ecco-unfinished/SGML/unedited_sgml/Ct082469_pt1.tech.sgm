<P>THE curio&s;ity entertained by all civilized nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I.</NOTE>
of enquiring into the exploits and adventures
of their ance&s;tors, commonly excites a regret
that the hi&s;tory of remote ages &s;hould always be &s;o much
involved in ob&s;curity, uncertainty, and contradiction.
Ingenious men, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lei&s;ure, are apt to pu&s;h their
re&s;earches beyond the period in which literary monuments
are framed or pre&s;erved, without reflecting, that the hi|&s;tory
of pa&s;t events is immediately lo&s;t or disfigured when
intru&s;ted to memory or oral tradition, and that the ad|ventures
of barbarous nations, even if they were pre&s;erv|ed,
could afford little or no entertainment to tho&s;e born
in a more cultivated age. The convul&s;ions of a civi|lized
<PB REF="8">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB REF="9">

<PB N="2" REF="10">
&s;tate u&s;ually compo&s;e the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and mo&s;t
intere&s;ting part of its hi&s;tory; but the &s;udden, violent,
and unprepared revolutions, incident to Barbarians, are
&s;o much guided by caprice, and terminate &s;o often in
cruelty, that they di&s;gu&s;t us by the uniformity of their
appearance; and it is rather fortunate for letters that
they are buried in &s;ilence and oblivion. The only cer|tain
means, by which nations can indulge their curio&s;ity
in re&s;earches concerning their remote origin, is to con&s;i|der
the language, manners and cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors,
and to compare them with tho&s;e of the neighbouring na|tions.
The fables, which are commonly employed to
&s;upply the place of true hi&s;tory, ought entirely to be di&s;|regarded;
and if any exception be admitted to this gene|ral
rule, it can only be in favour of the antient Greek
fictions, which are &s;o celebrated and &s;o agreeable, that
they will ever be the objects of the attention of mankind.
Neglecting therefore, all traditions or rather tales con|cerning
the more early hi&s;tory of Britain, we &s;hall only
con&s;ider the &s;tate of the inhabitants, as it appeared to the
Romans on their inva&s;ion of this country: We &s;hall
briefly run over the events, which attended the conque&s;t
made by that empire, as belonging more to Roman than
Briti&s;h, &s;tory: We &s;hall ha&s;ten thro' the ob&s;cure and un|intere&s;ting
period of Saxon annals; And &s;hall re&s;erve a
more full narration for tho&s;e times, when the truth $word$ both
&s;o well a&s;certained and &s;o complete as to promi&s;e &s;ome
entertainment and in&s;truction to the reader.</P>
<P>ALL antient writers agree in repre&s;enting the fir&s;t in|habitants
of Britain as a tribe of the Gauls or Celtae,
who peopled that i&s;land from the neighbouring continent.
Their language was the &s;ame, their manners, their go|vernment,
their &s;uper&s;tition; varied only by tho&s;e &s;mall
differences, which time or a communication with the
bordering nations mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily introduce. The inha|bitants
of Gaul, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts which lye con|tiguous
<PB N="3" REF="11">
to Italy, had acquired, from a commerce with
their &s;outhern neighbours, &s;ome refinement in the arts,
which gradually diffu&s;ed them&s;elves northwards, and
&s;pread but a very faint light over this i&s;land. The Greek
and Roman navigators or merchants (for there were
&s;carce any other travellers in tho&s;e ages) brought back
the mo&s;t &s;hocking accounts of the ferocity of the people,
which they magnified, as u&s;ual, in order to excite the ad|miration
of their countrymen. The &s;outh-ea&s;t parts,
however, of Britain had already, before the age of Cae|&s;ar,
made the fir&s;t and mo&s;t requi&s;ite &s;tep towards a civil
&s;ettlement, and the Britains, by tillage and agriculture,
had there encrea&s;ed to a great multitude<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar, lib. 4.</NOTE>. The other
inhabitants of the i&s;land &s;till maintained them&s;elves by
pa&s;turage; They were cloathed with &s;kins of bea&s;ts:
They dwelt in huts, which they reared in the fore&s;ts and
mar&s;hes, with which the country was covered: They
&s;hifted ea&s;ily their habitation, when actuated either by
the hopes of plunder or the fear of an enemy: The con|venience
of feeding their cattle was even a &s;ufficient mo|tive
for removing their &s;eats: And being ignorant of
all the refinements of life, their wants and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
were equally &s;canty and limited.</P>
<P>THE Britains were divided into many &s;mall nations or
tribes: and being a military people, who&s;e &s;ole property
was their &s;word and their cattle, it was impo&s;&s;ible, after
they had acquired a reli&s;h of liberty, for their princes or
chieftains to e&s;tabli&s;h any de&s;potic authority over them.
Their governments, tho' monarchical,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Diod. Sic. l. 4. Mela, lib. 3. cap. 6. Strabo, lib. 4</NOTE> were free, as
well as tho&s;e of all the Celtic nations; and the common
people &s;eem even to have enjoyed more liberty among
them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, lib. 75.</NOTE>, than among the nations of Gaul<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar, lib. 6.</NOTE>, from whom
they were de&s;cended. Each &s;tate was divided into fac|tions
<PB N="4" REF="12">
within it&s;elf<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE>: It was agitated with emulation to|wards
the neighbouring &s;tates: And while the arts of
peace were yet unknown, wars were the chief occupa|tion,
and formed the chief object of ambition among
the people.</P>
<P>THE religion of the Britains was one of the mo&s;t con|siderable
parts of their government; and the Druids,
who were their prie&s;ts, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great authority among
them. Be&s;ides mini&s;tring at the altar, and directing all
religious duties, they pre&s;ided over the education of
youth; they were endowed with an immunity from wars
and taxes; they enjoyed both the civil and criminal juri&s;|diction;
they decided all controver&s;ies among &s;tates as
well as private per&s;ons, and whoever refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to
their decree was expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties.
The &s;entence of excommunication was denounced again&s;t
him: He was forbid acce&s;s to the &s;acrifices or public wor|&s;hip:
He was debarred all intercour&s;e with his fellow-ci|tizens,
even in the common affairs of life: His company
was univer&s;ally &s;hunned, as profane and dangerous: He
was refu&s;ed the protection of law<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar, lib. 6. Strabo, lib. 4.</NOTE>: And death it&s;elf be|came
to him an acceptable relief from the mi&s;ery and in|famy
to which he was expo&s;ed. Thus, the bands of go|vernment,
which were naturally loo&s;e among that rude
and turbulent people, were happily corroborated by the
terrors of their &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>No &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;tition was ever more terrible than
that of the Druids. Be&s;ides the &s;evere penalties, which
it was in the power of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics to inflict in this
world, they inculcated the eternal tran&s;migration of &s;ouls;
and thereby extended their authority as far as the fears of
their timorous votaries. They practi&s;ed their rites in dark
groves or other &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Plin. lib. 12. cap. 1.</NOTE>; and in order to throw a
greater my&s;tery on their religion, they communicated
<PB N="5" REF="13">
their doctrines only to the initiated, and &s;trictly forbad
the committing them to writing; left they &s;hould at any
time be expo&s;ed to the examination of the profane vulgar.
Human &s;acrifices were practi&s;ed among them: The &s;poils
of war were often devoted to their divinities; and they
puni&s;hed with the &s;evere&s;t tortures whoever dared to &s;e|crete
any part of the con&s;ecrated offering: The&s;e trea&s;ures
they pre&s;erved in woods and fore&s;ts, &s;ecured by no other
guard than the terrors of their religion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Cae&s;ar, lib. 6.</NOTE> and this conti|nued
conque&s;t over human avidity may be regarded as
more &s;ignal than their prompting men to the mo&s;t extra|ordinary
and mo&s;t violent efforts. No idolatrous wor&s;hip
ever attained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over mankind as that of
the antient Gauls and Britains; and the Romans, after
their conque&s;t, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile the&s;e na|tions
to the laws and in&s;titutions of their ma&s;ters, while
it maintained its authority, were at la&s;t obliged to aboli&s;h
it by penal &s;tatutes; a violence, which had never in any
other in&s;tance been practi&s;ed by the&s;e tolerating conque|rors<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sueton. In vita Ciaudii.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The ROMANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Britains had long remained in this rude but inde|pendant
&s;tate, when Cae&s;ar, having over-run all
Gaul by his victories, fir&s;t ca&s;t his eye on their i&s;land.
He was not allured either by its riches or its renown; but
being ambitious of carrying the Roman arms into a new
world, then wholly unknown, he took advantage of a
&s;hort interval in his Gaulic wars, and made an inva&s;ion
on Britain. The natives, informed of his intention,
were &s;en&s;ible of the unequal conte&s;t, and endeavoured to
appea&s;e him by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno ant. C. 55.</NOTE> which, however, retarded
not the execution of his de&s;ign. After &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="6" REF="14">
he landed, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, at Deal, and having obtained
&s;everal advantages over the Britains, and obliged them to
promi&s;e ho&s;tages for their future dutiful behaviour, he
was con&s;trained, by the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs, and
the approach of winter, to withdraw his forces into
Gaul. The Britains, relieved from the terror of his
arms, neglected the performance of their &s;tipulations;
and that haughty conqueror re&s;olved next &s;ummer to
cha&s;ti&s;e them for this breach of treaty. He landed with
a greater force; and tho' he found a more regular re&s;i&s;t|ance
from the Britains, who had united under Ca&s;&s;ive|launus,
one of their petty princes; he di&s;comfited them
in every action. He advanced into the country; pa&s;&s;ed
the Thames in the face of the enemy; took and burned
the capital of Ca&s;&s;ivelaunus; e&s;tabli&s;hed his ally, Mandu|bratius,
in the &s;overeignty of the Trinobantes; and ha|ving
obliged the inhabitants to make him new &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions,
he again returned with his army into Gaul, and
left the authority of the Romans more nominal than real
in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>THE civil wars, which en&s;ued, and which prepared the
way for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of monarchy in Rome, &s;aved
the Britains from that yoke, which was ready to be im|po&s;ed
upon them. Augu&s;tus, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Cae&s;ar, con|tent
with the victory obtained over the liberties of his
own country, was little ambitious of acquiring fame by
foreign wars; and being apprehen&s;ive left the fame un|limited
extent of dominion, which had &s;ubverted the re|public,
might al&s;o overwhelm, the empire, he recommended
to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors never to enlarge the territories of
the Romans. Tiberius, jealous of the fame, which might
be acquired by his generals, made this advice of Augu&s;tus
a pretence for his inactivity<NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE> The mad &s;allies of Ca|ligula,
in which he menaced Britain with an inva&s;ion,
&s;erved only to expo&s;e him&s;elf and the empire to ridicule:
<PB N="7" REF="15">
and the Britains had now, during almo&s;t a century, en|joyed
their liberty unmole&s;ted; when the Romans, in
the reign of Claudius, began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of reducing
them under their dominion. Without &s;eeking any more
ju&s;tifiable rea&s;ons of ho&s;tility than were employed by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 43.</NOTE>
latter Europeans in &s;ubjecting the Africans and Ameri|cans,
they &s;ent over an army under the command of
Plautius, an able general, who gained &s;ome victories, and
made a considerable progre&s;s in &s;ubduing the inhabitants.
Claudius him&s;elf, finding affairs &s;ufficiently prepared for
his reception, made a journey into Britain; and received
the &s;ubmission of &s;everal Briti&s;h &s;tates, the Cantii, Atre|bates,
Regni, and Trinobantes, who inhabited the &s;outh|ea&s;t
parts of the i&s;land, and whom their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and
cultivated manner of life rendered willing to purcha&s;e
peace at the expence of their liberty. The other Britains,
under the command of Caractacus, &s;till maintained an
ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, and the Romans made little progre&s;s
again&s;t them; till O&s;torius Scapula was &s;ent over to
command their armies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 50.</NOTE> This general advanced the Ro|man
conque&s;ts over the Britains; pierced into the coun|try
of the Silures, a warlike nation, who inhabited the
banks of the Severne; defeated Caractacus in a great bat|tle;
took him pri&s;oner, and &s;ent him to Rome, where
his magnanimous behaviour procured him better treat|ment
than tho&s;e conquerors u&s;ually be&s;towed on captive
princes<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. Lib. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>NOT WITHSTANDING the&s;e misfortunes, the Britains
were not &s;ubdued; and this i&s;land was regarded by the
ambitious Romans as a field, in which military honour
might &s;till be acquired.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 59.</NOTE> Under the reign of Nero, Sue|tonius
Paulinus was inve&s;ted with the command, and
prepared to &s;ignalize his name by victories over the&s;e bar|barians.
Finding that the i&s;land of Mona, now Angle|&s;ey,
<PB N="8" REF="16">
was the chief &s;eat of the Druids, he re&s;olved to at|tack
it, and to &s;ubject a place, which was the center of
their &s;uper&s;tition, and which afforded protection, to all
their baffled forces. The Britains endeavoured to ob|&s;truct
his landing on this &s;acred i&s;land, both by the force
of their arms and the terrors of their religion., The wo|men
and prie&s;ts were intermingled with the &s;oldiers upon
the &s;hore; and running about with flaming torches in
their hands, and to&s;&s;ing their di&s;hevelled hair, they &s;truck
greater terror into the a&s;toni&s;hed Romans by their howl|ings,
cries, and execrations, than the real danger from,
the armed forces was able to in&s;pire. But Suetonius, ex|horting
his troops to de&s;pi&s;e the menaces of a &s;uper&s;tition,
which they de&s;pi&s;ed, impelled them to the attack, drove
the Britains off the field, burned the Druids in the fame
fires which they had prepared for their captive enemies,
de&s;troyed all the con&s;ecrated groves and altars; and hav|ing
thus triumphed over the religion of the Britains, he
thought his future progre&s;s would be ea&s;y in reducing the
people to &s;ubjection. But he was di&s;appointed in his expec|tations.
The Britains, taking advantage of his ab&s;ence,
were all in arms; and being headed by Boadicea, Queen
of the Iceni, who had been treated in the mo&s;t ignominy|ous
manner by the Roman tribunes, had already attacked
with &s;ucce&s;s &s;everal &s;ettlements of their in&s;ulting conquer|ors.
Suetonius ha&s;tened to the protection of London,
which was already a flourishing Romar colony; but
found on his arrival, that it would be requi&s;ite for the ge|neral
&s;afety to abandon that place to the mercile&s;s fury of
the enemy. London was reduced to a&s;hes; &s;uch of the
inhabitants, as remained in it, cruelly ma&s;&s;acred; the
Romans and all &s;trangers, to the number of 70,000, put
to the &s;word without diftinction; and the Britains, by
rendering the war thus bloody, &s;eemed determined to cut
off all hopes of peace or compo&s;tion with the enemy. But
this cruelty was revenged by Suetonius in a great and de|ci&s;ive
<PB N="9" REF="17">
battle, where 80,000 of the Britains are &s;aid to have
peri&s;hed; and Boadicea her&s;elf, rather than fall into the
hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her own life
by poi&s;on<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. lib. 14.</NOTE>. Nero &s;oon after recalled Suetonius from a
government, where by &s;uffering and inflicting &s;o many
&s;everities, he was judged improper for compo&s;ing the
angry and alarmed minds of the inhabitants. After &s;ome
interval, Cerealis received the command from Ve&s;pa&s;ian,
and by his bravery propagated the terror of the Roman
arms. Julius Frontinus &s;ucceeded Cerealis both in au|thority
and reputation: But the general, who finally e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
the dominion of the Romans in this i&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 78.</NOTE> was
Julius Agricola, who governed it in the reigns of Ve&s;pa|&s;ian,
Titus, and Domitian, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf
in that &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>THIS great commander formed a regular plan for &s;ub|duing
Britain, and rendering the acqui&s;ition u&s;eful to the
conquerors. He carried his victorious arms northwards,
defeated the Britains in every encounter, pierced into the
inacce&s;&s;ible fore&s;ts and mountains of Caledonia, reduced
every thing to &s;ubjection in the &s;outhern parts of the
i&s;land, and chaced before him all the men of fiercer and
more intractable &s;pirits, who deemed war and death it&s;elf
le&s;s intolerable than &s;ervitude under the victors. He even
defeated them in a deci&s;ive action, which they fought un|der
Galcacus, their leader; and having drawn a rampart,
and fixed a train of garri&s;ons between the friths of Clyde
and Forth, he thereby cut off the ruder and more barren
parts of the i&s;land, and &s;ecured the Roman province from
the inva&s;ion of the barbarous inhabitants<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE></P>
<P>DURING the&s;e military enterprizes, he neglected not
the arts of peace. He introduced laws and civility among
the Britains, taught them to de&s;ire and rai&s;e all the con|veniencies
of life, reconciled them to the Roman lan|guage
<PB N="10" REF="18">
and manners, in&s;tructed them in letters and &s;ci|ence,
and employed every expedient to render tho&s;e
chains, which he had forged, both ea&s;y and agreeable to
them<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Agr.</NOTE>. The inhabitants having experienced how une|qual
their own force was to re&s;i&s;t that of the Romans, ac|quie&s;ced
in the dominion of their ma&s;ters, and were gra|dually
incorporated as a part of that mighty empire.</P>
<P>THIS was the la&s;t durable conque&s;t made by the Ro|mans;
and Britain, once &s;ubdued, gave no farther in|quietude
to the victor. Caledonia alone, defended by its
barren mountains, and by the contempt which the Ro|mans
entertained of it, &s;ometimes infe&s;ted the more culti|vated
parts of the i&s;land by the incur&s;ions of its inhabi|tants.
The better to &s;ecure the frontiers of the empire,
Adrian, who vi&s;ited this i&s;land, built a &s;trong rampart be|tween
Tyne and the frith of Solway: Lollius Urbicus,
under Antoninus Pius, repaired that of Agricola: Severus,
who made an expedition into Britain, and carried his
arms into the mo&s;t northern extremity of it, added new
fortifications to the wall of Adrian; and during all the
reigns of the Roman emperors, &s;uch a profound tranquil|lity
prevailed in Britain, that little mention is made of the
affairs of that i&s;land by any hi&s;torian. The only inci|dents
which occur, are &s;ome &s;editions or rebellions of the
Roman legions quartered there, and &s;ome u&s;urpations of
the imperial dignity by the Roman governors. The na|tives,
di&s;armed, di&s;pirited, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, had lof&s; all
de&s;ire and even idea of their former liberty and indepen|dance.</P>
<P>BUT the period was now come, when that enormous
fabric of the Roman empire, which had diffu&s;ed &s;lavery
and oppre&s;&s;ion, together with peace and civility, over &s;o,
con&s;iderable a part of the globe, was approaching towards
its final di&s;&s;olution. Italy, and the center of the empire,
removed, during &s;o many ages, from all concern in the
<PB N="11" REF="19">
wars, had entirely lo&s;t the military &s;pirit, and were peo|pled
by an enervated race, equally di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to a
foreign yoke, or to the tyranny of their own rulers. The
emperors found them&s;elves obliged to recruit their legions
from the frontier provinces, where the genius of war,
though langui&s;hing, was not totally extinct; and the&s;e
mercenary forces, carele&s;s of laws and civil in&s;titutions,
e&s;tabli&s;hed a military government, no le&s;s dangerous to
the &s;overeign than to the people. The farther pro|gre&s;s
of the &s;ame di&s;orders introduced the bordering
barbarians into the &s;ervice of the Romans; and tho&s;e
fierce nations, having now added di&s;cipline and &s;kill to
their native bravery, could no longer be re&s;trained by the
impotent policy of the emperors, who were accu&s;tomed
to employ the one in the destruction of the other. Sen|&s;ible
of their own force, and allured by the pro&s;pect of &s;o
rich a prize, the northern barbarians, in the reign of Ar|cadius
and Honorius, a&s;&s;ailed at once all the frontiers of
the Roman empire; and having fir&s;t &s;atiated their avidity
by plunder, began to think of fixing a &s;ettlement in the
wa&s;ted provinces. The more di&s;tant barbarians, who oc|cupied
the de&s;erted habitations of the former, advanced
in their acqui&s;itions, and pre&s;&s;ed with their incumbent
weight the Roman &s;tate, already unequal to the load
which it &s;u&s;tained. In&s;tead of arming the people in their
own defence, the emperors recalled all the di&s;tant legions,
in whom alone they could repo&s;e confidence; and collect|ed
the whole military force for the defence of the capital
and center of the empire. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion
had &s;uperceded the ambition of power; and the an|cient
point of honour, of never contracting the limits of
the empire, could no longer be attended to in this de&s;pe|rate
extremity.</P>
<P>BRITAIN by its &s;ituation was removed from the fury of
the&s;e barbarous incur&s;ions; and being al&s;o a remote pro|vince,
not much valued by the Romans, the legions,
<PB N="12" REF="20">
which defended it, were carried over to the protection of
Italy and Gaul. But that province, though &s;ecured by
the &s;ea again&s;t the inroads of the greater tribes of barbari|ans,
found enemies on its frontiers, who took advantage
of its pre&s;ent defencele&s;s &s;ituation. The Picts and Scots,
who dwelt in the northern parts, beyond the wall of An|toninus,
made incur&s;ions upon their peaceable and effemi|nate
neighbours; and be&s;ides the temporary depredations
which they committed, threatened the whole province
with &s;ubjection, or, what the inhabitants more dreaded,
with plunder and deva&s;tation. The former nation &s;eem
to have been a tribe of the native Briti&s;h race, who, hav|ing
been chaced into the northern parts by the conque&s;ts
of Agricola, had there intermingled with the ancient in|habitants:
The other were derived from the &s;ame Celtic
origin, had fir&s;t been e&s;tabli&s;hed in Ireland, had &s;ent over
a colony to the north-we&s;t coa&s;ts of this i&s;land, and had
long been accu&s;tomed, as well from their old as their new
&s;eats, to infe&s;t the Roman province by their pyracy and
rapine. The&s;e two tribes, finding their more opulent
neighbours expo&s;ed to inva&s;ion, &s;oon broke over the Ro|man
wall, no longer defended by the Roman arms; and
though a contemptible enemy in them&s;elves, met with no
re&s;i&s;tance from the unwarlike inhabitants. The Britains,
accu&s;tomed to have recour&s;e to the emperors for defence
as well as government, made &s;upplications to Rome; and
one legion was &s;ent over for their protection. This force
was an over-match for the barbarians, repelled their inva|&s;ion,
routed them in every engagement, and having chaced
them into their ancient limits, returned in triumph to the
defence of the &s;outhern provinces of the empire<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Bede, lib. 1. cap. 12. Paull. Diacon. Alured. Beverl. P. 43. ex edit. Hearne.</NOTE>. Their
retreat brought on a new inva&s;ion of the enemy. The
Britains made again an application to Rome, and ob|tained
again the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a legion, which proved ef|fectual
<PB N="13" REF="21">
for their relief: But the Romans, reduced to ex|tremities
at home, and fatigued with the&s;e di&s;tant expe|ditions,
informed the Britains that they mu&s;t no longer
look to them for &s;uccour, exhorted them to arm in their
own defence, and urged, that as they were now their
own ma&s;ters, it became them, to protect by their valour
that independance which their ancient lords had confer|red
upon them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 12. Gul. Malm. p. 8. Ann. Beverl. p. 44.</NOTE>. That they might leave the i&s;land with
the better grace, the Romans a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in erecting
anew the wall of Severus, which was built entirely of
&s;tone, and which the Britains had not at that time arti|zans
&s;kilful enough to repair<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 12. Ann. Beverl. p. 44.</NOTE>. And having done this
la&s;t good office to the inhabitants, they bid a final adieu
to Britain, about the year 448; after being matters of
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of it during the cour&s;e of near
four centuries.</P>

<HEAD>The BRITAINS.</HEAD>
<P>THE abject Britains regarded this pre&s;ent of liberty as
fatal to them; and were in no condition to put in
practice the prudent advice given them by the Romans,
of arming in their own defence. Unaccu&s;tomed both to
the perils of war, and to the cares of civil government,
they found them&s;elves incapable of forming or executing
any mea&s;ures for re&s;i&s;ting the incur&s;ions of the barbarians.
Gratian al&s;o and Con&s;tantine, two Romans who had a
little before a&s;&s;umed the purple in Britain, had carried
over into the continent the flower of the Briti&s;h youth;
and having peri&s;hed in their un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts on the
imperial throne, had de&s;poiled the i&s;land of tho&s;e, who,
in this de&s;perate extremity, were be&s;t able to defend it.
The Picts and Scots, finding that the Romans had final|ly
relinqui&s;hed Britain, now regarded the whole as their
<PB N="14" REF="22">
prize, and attacked the northern wall with redoubled for|ces.
The Britains, already &s;ubdued by their own fears,
found the ramparts but a weak defence for them; and de|&s;erting
their &s;tation, left the country entirely open to the
inroads of the barbarous enemy. The invaders carried
deva&s;tation and ruin along with them; and exerted to the
utmo&s;t their native ferocity, which was not mitigated by
the helple&s;s condition and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive behaviour of the in|habitants<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Bede, lib. 1. Ann. Beverl. p. 45.</NOTE>
The unhappy Britains had a third time re|cour&s;e
to Rome, which had declared its re&s;olution for ever
to abandon them. Aetius, the patrician, &s;u&s;tained, at
that time, by his valour and magnanimity, the tottering
ruins of the empire, and revived for a moment among the
degenerate Romans the &s;pirit, as well as di&s;cipline of
their ance&s;tors. The Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;adors carried to him
the letter of their countrymen, which was in&s;cribed, <HI>The
Groans of the Britains.</HI> The tenor of the epi&s;tle was &s;uit|able

Aetius, pre&s;&s;ed by the arms of Attila, the mo&s;t terrible
enemy that ever a&s;&s;ailed the empire, had no lei&s;ure to at|tend
to the complaints of allies, whom genero&s;ity alone
could induce him to a&s;&s;i&s;t<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. II. Edit. 1692.</NOTE>. The Britains, thus rejected,
were reduced to de&s;pair, de&s;erted their habitations, aban|doned
tillage, and flying for protection to the fore&s;ts and
mountains, &s;uffered equally from hunger and from the
enemy. The barbarians them&s;elves began to feel the
pre&s;&s;ures of famine in a country which they had ravaged;
and being harra&s;&s;ed by the di&s;per&s;ed Britains, who had not
dared to re&s;i&s;t them in a body, they retreated with their
&s;poils into their own country<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ann. Beverl. P. 45.</NOTE>.</P>

THE Britains, taking advantage of this interval, re|turned

<P>OF all the barbarous nations, known either in ancient
or modern times, the Germans &s;eem to have been
the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed both by their manners and political
in&s;titutions, and to have carried to the highe&s;t pitch the
virtues of valour and love of liberty; the only virtues
which can have place among an uncivilized people, where
ju&s;tice and humanity are commonly neglected. Kingly
government, even when e&s;tabli&s;hed among the Germans,
(for it was not univer&s;al) po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very limited autho|rity;
and though the &s;overeign was u&s;ually cho&s;en from
among&s;t the royal family, he was obliged to be directed in
every mea&s;ure by the common con&s;ent of the nation,
over whom he pre&s;ided. When any important affairs
were tran&s;acted, all the warriors of the nation met in
arms; the men of greate&s;t authority employed per&s;ua&s;ion
to engage their cont&s;ent; the people expre&s;&s;ed their appro|bation
by rattling their armour, or their di&s;&s;ent by mur|murs;
there was no nece&s;&s;ity for a nice &s;crutiny of votes
among a multitude, who were u&s;ually carried with a
&s;trong current to one fide or the other; and the mea&s;ure
thus &s;uddenly cho&s;en by general agreement, was execut|ed
with alacrity, and prosecuted with vigour. Even i$
war, their princes governed more by example than by
authority: But in peace, the civil union was in a great
mea&s;ure di&s;&s;olved, and the inferior leaders admini&s;tere$
ju&s;tice, after an independant manner, each in his parti|cular
di&s;trict. The&s;e were elected by the votes of th$
people in their great councils; and though regard wa$
paid to nobility in the choice, their per&s;onal qualities
<PB N="17" REF="25">
chiefly their valour, procured them from the &s;uffrages $word$
their fellow-citizens that honourable but dangerous di|&s;tinction.
The warriors of each tribe attached them|&s;elves
to their leader, with the mo&s;t devoted affection and
mo&s;t un&s;haken con&s;tancy. They attended him as his or|nament
in peace, as his defence in war, as his council in
the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. Their con&s;tant emulation
in military renown di&s;&s;olved not that inviolable friend&s;hip
which they profe&s;&s;ed to their chieftain and to each other.
To die for the honour of their band was their chief ambi|tion:
To &s;urvive its di&s;grace, or the death of their lead|er,
was infamous. They even carried into the field their
women and children, who adopted all the martial &s;enti|ments
of the men: And being thus impelled by every hu|man
motive, they were invincible; where they were not
oppo&s;ed, either by the &s;imilar manners and in&s;titutions of
the neighbouring Germans, or by the &s;uperior di&s;cipline,

not beyond a bare &s;ub$i&s;tance; and the honours, acquired
by a &s;uperior rank, were the only reward of their &s;upe|rior
dangers and fatigues. All the refined arts of life
were unknown among the Germans: Tillage it&s;elf was
almo&s;t wholly neglected: They &s;eem to have been even
anxious to prevent any improvements of that nature; and
the leaders, by annually distributing anew all the land
among the inhabitants of each village, prevented them
from attaching them&s;elves to particular po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or
making any &s;uch progre&s;s in agriculture as might divert

<P>THESE two brothers, ob&s;erving the other provinces of

<P>THE Britains, impelled by the&s;e violent extremities, and

were nece&s;&s;itated to take arms; and having depo&s;ed Vor|tigern,
who had become odious from, his vices, and from

under the command of his &s;on, Vortimer<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Math. We&s;t. A. D. 454. Gul. Malm. p. 9.</NOTE>. They fought
many battles with their enemies; and tho' the victories in
the&s;e actions be di&s;puted between the Briti&s;h and Saxon
annali&s;ts, the progre&s;s &s;till made by the Saxons prove that
the advantage was commonly on their fide. In one bat|tle,

over his countrymen in the hands of Hengi&s;t<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Math. We&s;t. A. D. 455. Saxon Chron. p. 13. Nennius, cap. 46.</NOTE>. This ac|tive

the terror of his arms, he &s;pared neither age, nor &s;ex, nor

The private and public edifices of the Britains were
reduced to a&s;hes: The prie&s;ts were &s;laughtered on the al|tars
by the&s;e idolatrous ravagers: The bi&s;hops and nobi|lity
&s;hared the fate of the vulgar: The people flying into
the mountains and de&s;erts, were intercepted and butcher|ed
in heaps: Some were glad to accept of life and &s;ervi|tude

country, took &s;helter in the province of Armorica; where
being charitably received by a people of the &s;ame language

the country the name of Brittany<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15. U$her, p. 226. Gildas, &sect;. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Briti&s;h writers a&s;&s;ign one cau&s;e, which facilitated
the entrance of the Saxons into this i&s;land; the love,

<P>AFTER the death of Vortimer, Ambro&s;ius, a Britain,

to unite them in their re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Saxons.
The&s;e conte&s;ts increa&s;ed the animo&s;ity between the two
nations, and rouzed the military &s;pirit of the ancient in|habitants
which had before been &s;unk into &s;uch a fatal

lethargy. Hengi&s;t, however, notwith&s;tanding their op|position,
&s;till kept his ground in Britain; and in order to
divide the forces and attention of the Britains, he called
over a new t$ibe of Saxons under the command of his
brother Octa, and of Ebi&s;&s;a, the &s;on of Octa; and he
&s;ettled them in Northumberland. He him&s;elf remained
in the &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, and laid the founda|tion
of the kingdom of Kent, comprehending the county
of that name, Middle&s;ex, E&s;&s;ex, and part of Surrey. He
fixed his royal &s;eat at Canterbury; where he governed
about forty years, and he died in or near the year 488;
leaving his new acquired dominions to his po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of Hengi&s;t excited the avidity of the other
inhabitants of the northern regions of Germany; and at
different times, and under different leaders, they flocked
over in multitudes to the inva&s;ion of this i&s;land. The&s;e
conquerors were chiefly compo&s;ed of three tribes, the Sax|ons,
Angles, arid Jutes<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 15. Ethelwerd, p. 833. Edit. Camdeni. Chron. Sax. p. 12. Ann. Beverl. p. 78. The inhabitants of Kent and the I&s;$e of Wight were Jutes. E&s;&s;ex, Middle&s;ex, Surrey, Su&s;&s;ex, and all the &s;outhern counties to Cornwal, were peopled by Saxons: Mercia and other parts of the kingdom were inhabited by Angles,</NOTE> who pa&s;&s;ed, all of them, un|der

being governed by the &s;ame in&s;titutions, they were natu|rally
led, from the&s;e cau&s;es, as well as from their com|mon
intere&s;t, to unite them&s;elves again&s;t the antient inha|bitants.
The re&s;i&s;tance, however unequal, was &s;till
maintained by the Britains; but became every day more
feeble: And their misfortunes admitted of few intervals,
till they were driven into Cornwal and Wales, and re|ceived
protection from the remote &s;ituation or inacce&s;&s;ible
mountains of tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Saxon &s;tate, after that of Kent, which was
e&s;tabli&s;hed in Britain, was the kingdom of South-Saxo|ny.
<PB N="23" REF="31">
In the year 477<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 14. Ann. Beverl. p. 81.</NOTE>. Aella, a Saxon chieftain, brought
over an army from Germany; and landing in the &s;outh|ern
coa&s;t, proceeded to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the neighbour|ing
territory. The Britains, now armed, abandoned not
tamely their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; nor were they expelled, till de|feated
in many battles by their warlike invaders. The
mo&s;t memorable action, mentioned by hi&s;torians, is that
of Mearcredes-Burn<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Saxon. Chron. A. D. 485. Flor. Wigorn</NOTE>. where, tho' the Saxons &s;eem to
have obtained the victory, they &s;uffered &s;o con&s;iderable a
lo&s;s, as &s;omewhat retarded the progre&s;s of their conque&s;ts.
But Aella, re-inforced by fre&s;h numbers of his country|men,
again took the field again&s;t the Britains; and laid
&s;iege to Andred-Cea&s;ter, which was defended by the gar|ri&s;on
and inhabitants with de&s;perate valour<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Hen. Huntin. lib. 2.</NOTE>. The Sax|ons,
enraged by this re&s;i&s;tance, and by the fatigues and
dangers which they had &s;u&s;tained, redoubled their efforts
again&s;t the place, and when ma&s;ters of it, put all their
enemies to the &s;word without di&s;tinction. This deci&s;ive
advantage &s;ecured the conque&s;ts of Aella, who a&s;&s;umed
the name of King, and extended his dominion over Su&s;|&s;ex
and a great part of Surrey. He was &s;topped in his
progre&s;s to the ea&s;t by the kingdom of Kent: In that to
the we&s;t, by another tribe of Saxons, who had taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that territory.</P>
<P>THESE Saxons, from the &s;ituation of the country, in
which they &s;ettled, were called the We&s;t-Saxons, and
landed in the year 495, under the command of Cerdic,
and of his &s;on Kenric<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Will. Malm. lib. 1. cap. 1. p. 12. Chron. Sax. p. 15.</NOTE>. The Britains were, by pa&s;t ex|perience,
&s;o much on their guard, and &s;o well prepared to
receive the enemy, that they gave battle to Cerdic the
very day of his landing; and tho' vanqui&s;hed, &s;till de|fended,
for &s;ome time, their liberties again&s;t the invaders.
None of the other tribes of Saxons met with &s;uch vigor|ous
<PB N="24" REF="32">
re&s;i&s;tance, or exerted &s;uch valour and per&s;everance in
pu&s;hing their conque&s;ts. Cerdic was even obliged to call
for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his countrymen from the kingdoms of
Kent and Su&s;&s;ex, as -well as from Germany, and he was
thence joined by a fre&s;h army under the command of
Porte, and of his &s;ons Bleda and Megla<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 17.</NOTE>. Strengthened
by the&s;e &s;uccours, he fought in the year 508 a de&s;perate
battle with the Britains, commanded by Nazan-Leod,
their leader, who was victorious in the beginning of the
action, and routed the wing in which Cerdic him&s;elf
commanded. But Kenric, who had prevailed in the
other wing, brought timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his father, and
re&s;tored the battle, which ended in a complete victory on
the fide of the Saxons<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 2. Ethelwerd, lib. 1. Chron. Sax. p. 17.</NOTE>. Nazan-Leod peri&s;hed, with
5000 of his army: But left the Britains more weakened
than di&s;couraged by his death. The war &s;till continued,
tho' the &s;ucce&s;s was commonly on the &s;ide of the Saxons,
who&s;e &s;hort &s;words and clo&s;e manner of fighting, gave
them great advantage over the mi&s;&s;ile weapons of the
Britains. Cerdic was not wanting to his good fortune;
and in order to extend his conque&s;ts, he laid &s;iege to
Mount Badon or Bane&s;downe near Bath, whither the
Mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of the di&s;comfited Britains had retired. The
&s;outhern Britains in this extremity applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance
to Arthur, prince of the Silures, who&s;e heroic valour now
&s;u&s;tained the declining fate of his country<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hunting. lib. 2.</NOTE>. This is that
Arthur &s;o much celebrated by the &s;ongs of Thalie&s;&s;in,
and the other Briti&s;h bards, and who&s;e military atchieve|ments
have been blended with &s;o many fables as to give
occa&s;ion for entertaining a doubt of his real exi&s;tence.
But poets, tho' they disfigure the mo&s;t certain hi&s;tory by
their fictions, and u&s;e &s;trange liberties with truth where
they are the &s;ole hi&s;torians, as among the Britains, have
commonly &s;ome foundation for their wilde&s;t exaggera|tions.
<PB N="25" REF="33">
Certain it is, that the &s;iege of Badon was rai&s;ed
by the Britains in the year 520, and the Saxons there
di&s;comfited in a great battle<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gildas, Saxon Chron. H. Hunting, lib. 2.</NOTE>. This misfortune &s;top|ed
the progre&s;s of Cerdic; but was not &s;ufficient to wre&s;t
from him the conque&s;ts, which he had already made.
He and his &s;on, Kenric, who &s;ucceeded him, e&s;tabli&s;hed
the kingdom of the We&s;t-Saxons or of We&s;&s;ex over the
counties of Hants, Dor&s;et, Wilts, Berks, and the I&s;le

<P>WHILE the Saxons made this progre&s;s in the &s;outh,
their countrymen were not le&s;s active in other quarters.
In the year 527<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting, lib. 2,</NOTE> a great tribe of adventurers, under &s;e|veral
leaders, landed on the ea&s;t-coa&s;t of Britain; and
after fighting many battles, of which hi&s;tory has pre&s;erv|ed
no particular account, they e&s;tabli&s;hed three new king|doms
in this i&s;land. Uffa a&s;&s;umed the title of king of the

and Erkenwin that of Ea&s;t-Saxony or E&s;&s;ex nearly about
the &s;ame time; but the year is uncertain. This latter
kingdom was di&s;membered from that of Kent, and com|prehended
E&s;&s;ex, Middle&s;ex, and part of Hertford&s;hire.
That of the Ea&s;t-Angles, the counties of Cambridge,
Suffolk and Norfolk: Mercia was extended over all the
middle counties, from the banks of the Severn, to the
frontiers of the&s;e two kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE Saxons, &s;oon after the landing of Hengi&s;t, had
been planted in Northumberland; but meeting with an
ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, and making but &s;mall progre&s;s in
&s;ubduing the inhabitants, their affairs were in &s;o un|&s;ettled

a de&s;cent, as did all the other princes of that nation,
from Woden, brought over a reinforcement from Ger|many,
and enabled the Northumbrians to carry on their
conque&s;ts again&s;t the Britains. He entirely &s;ubdued the
county, now called Northumberland, the bi&s;hopric of
Durham, as well as &s;ome of the &s;outh-ea&s;t counties of
Scotland; and he a&s;&s;umed the crown under the title of
King of Bernicia. Nearly about the &s;ame time, Aella,
another Saxon prince, having conquered Lanca&s;hire, and
the greate&s;t part of York&s;hire, received the appellation of
King of De&iuml;ri<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ann. Beverl. p. 78.</NOTE> The&s;e two kingdoms were united in
the per&s;on of Ethelfrid, grand&s;on of Ida, who married
Acca, the daughter of Aella; and expelling her brother,
Edwin, e&s;tabli&s;hed one of the mo&s;t powerful of the Saxon
kingdoms, under the title of Northumberland. How far
his dominions extended into the country now called Scot|land
is uncertain; but it cannot be doubted, that all the
lowlands, e&s;pecially the ea&s;t-coa&s;t of that country, were
peopled in a great mea&s;ure from Germany; tho' the expe|ditions,
made by the &s;everal Saxon adventurers, have
e&s;caped the records of hi&s;tory. The language, &s;poke in
the&s;e countries, which is purely Saxon, is a &s;tronger

<HEAD>The HEPTARCHY.</HEAD>
<P>THUS was e&s;tabli&s;hed, after a violent &s;truggle of
near an hundred and fifty years, the Heptarchy, or
&s;even Saxon kingdoms, in Britain; and the whole
&s;outhern part of the i&s;land, except Wales and Cornwal,
<PB N="27" REF="35">
had totally changed its inhabitants, language, cu&s;toms,
and political in&s;titutions. The Britains, under the Ro|man
dominion, had made &s;uch advances towards arts and
civil manners, that they had built twenty-eight con&s;ider|able
cities within their province, be&s;ides a great number
of villages and country-feats<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Gildas. Bede, lib. I.</NOTE>; but the fierce conquerors,
by whom they were now &s;ubdued, threw every thing
back into antient barbarity; and tho&s;e few natives, who
were not either ma&s;&s;acred or expelled their habitations,
were reduced to the mo&s;t abject flavery. None of the
other northern conquerors, the Franks, Goths, Vandals,
or Burgundians, tho' they over-ran the &s;outhern provin|ces,
like a mighty torrent, made &s;uch deva&s;tations in the
conquered territories, or were inflamed into &s;uch a vio|lent
animo&s;ity again&s;t the antient inhabitants. As the
Saxons came over at intervals in &s;eparate bodies,
the Britains, however at fir&s;t unwarlike, were tempt|ed
to make re&s;i&s;tance; and ho&s;tilities, being there|by
prolonged, proved more de&s;tructive to both par|ties,
e&s;pecially to the vanqui&s;hed. The fir&s;t invad|ers
from Germany, in&s;tead of excluding other adven|turers,
who mu&s;t &s;hare with them the &s;poils and proper|ty
of the antient inhabitants, were obliged to invite over
fre&s;h &s;upplies from their own country; and a total exter|mination
of the Britains became the &s;ole expedient for
providing a &s;ettlement and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance to the new plant|ers.
Hence there have been found in hi&s;tory few con|que&s;ts
more ruinous than that of the Saxons; and few
revolutions more violent than that which they introduced.</P>
<P>So long as the conte&s;t was maintained with the natives,
the &s;everal Saxon princes pre&s;erved an union of councils
and intere&s;ts; but after the Britains were &s;hut up in the
barren countries of Cornwal and Wales, and gave no far|ther
inquietude to the conquerors, the band of alliance
was in a great mea&s;ure di&s;&s;olved among the princes of the
<PB N="28" REF="36">
Heptarchy; and tho' one prince &s;eems &s;till to have been
allowed or to have a&s;&s;umed an a&s;cendant over the whole,
his authority, if it ought ever to be deemed regular or
legal, was extremely limited; and each &s;tate acted as if it
had been totally &s;eparate and independant of the re&s;t.
Wars, therefore, and revolutions and di&s;&s;entions were
unavoidable among a turbulent and military people; and
the&s;e events, however intricate or confu&s;ed, &s;hould now
become the objects of our attention. But, added to the
difficulty of carrying on at once the hi&s;tory of &s;even inde|pendant
kingdoms, there is a great di&s;couragement to a
writer, ari&s;ing from the uncertainty, at lea&s;t barrenne&s;s,
of the accounts tran&s;mitted to us. The Monks, who
were the only annali&s;ts during tho&s;e ages, lived remote
from public affairs, con&s;idered the civil tran&s;actions as en|tirely
&s;ubordinate to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and be&s;ides parta|king
of the ignorance and barbarity, which were then
univer&s;al, were &s;trongly infected with credulity, with the
love of wonder, and with a propen&s;ity to impo&s;ture;
vices almo&s;t in&s;eparable from their profe&s;&s;ion, and man|ner
of life. The hi&s;tory of that period abounds in names,
but is extremely barren of events; or the events are re|lated
&s;o much without circum&s;tances and cau&s;es, that the
mo&s;t profound or mo&s;t eloquent writer mu&s;t de&s;pair of
rendering them either in&s;tructive or entertaining to the
reader. Even the great learning and vigorous imagina|tion
of Milton &s;unk under the weight; and this author
&s;cruples not to declare, that he e&s;teems the &s;kirmi&s;hes of
kites or crows equally de&s;erving of a particular narrative,
as the con&s;u&s;ed tran&s;actions and battles of the Saxon
Heptarchy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Milton in Kennet, p. 50.</NOTE>. In order, however, to connect the events
in &s;ome tolerable mea&s;ure, we &s;hall give a &s;uccinct ac|count

<HEAD>The Kingdom of KENT.</HEAD>
<P>ESCUS &s;ucceeded his father, Hengi&s;t, in the kingdom
of Kent; but &s;eems not to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the military
reputation enjoyed by that conqueror, who fir&s;t made way
for the entrance of the Saxon arms into Britain. All the
Saxons, who &s;ought the &s;ame of valour, or new e&s;tabli&s;h|ments
by arms, flocked to the &s;tandard of Aella, King
of Su&s;&s;ex, who was carrying on &s;ucce&s;sful war again&s;t
the Britains, and laying the foundations of a new king|dom.
E&s;cus was contented to po&s;&s;e&s;s in tranquillity the
kingdom of Kent, which he left in 512 to his &s;on Octa,
in who&s;e time the Ea&s;t-Saxons e&s;tabli&s;hed their monarchy,
and di&s;membered the provinces of E&s;&s;ex and Middle&s;ex
from that of Kent. His death, after twenty-two years
reign, made room for his &s;on Hermenric in 534, who
performed nothing memorable during a reign of thirty|two
years; except a&s;&s;ociating with him his &s;on, Ethel|bert,
in the government, in order the better to &s;ecure
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his family, and prevent &s;uch revolutions
as are incident to a turbulent and barbarous monarchy.</P>
<P>ETHELBERT revived the reputation of his family,
which had langui&s;hed for fome generations. The inacti|vity
of his predece&s;&s;ors, and the &s;ituation of his country,
&s;ecured from all ho&s;tility with the Britains, &s;eems to
have much weakened the warlike genius of the Kenti&s;h
Saxons; and Ethelbert, in his fir&s;t attempt to aggrandize
his country, and di&s;tingui&s;h his own name, met with
very bad &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 21.</NOTE>. He was twice di&s;comfited in battle
by Ceaulin, King of We&s;&s;ex; and obliged to yield the
&s;uperiority in the Heptarchy to that ambitious monarch,
who pre&s;erved no moderation in his victory, and by &s;ub|jecting
the kingdom of Su&s;&s;ex, excited jealou&s;y in all the
<PB N="30" REF="38">
other princes. An a&s;&s;ociation was formed again&s;t him;
and Ethelbert, entru&s;ted with the command of the allies,
fought him in a great battle, and obtained a deci&s;ive vic|tory<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 2.</NOTE>.
Ceaulin died &s;oon after; and Ethelbert &s;ucceed|ed
as well to his a&s;cendant among the Saxon &s;tates, as to
his other ambitious and exorbitant projects. He reduced
all the princes, except the king of Northumberland, to a
&s;trict dependance upon him; and even e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf
by force on the throne of Mercia, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive of
the Saxon kingdoms. Apprehen&s;ive, however, of a dan|gerous
league again&s;t him, like that by which he him&s;elf
had been enabled to overthrow Ceaulin, he had the pru|dence
to re&s;ign the throne of Mercia to Webba, the
rightful heir, the &s;on of Crida, who had fir&s;t founded
that monarchy. But governed &s;till by ambition more
than by ju&s;tice, he gave Webba po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown
on &s;uch conditions, as rendered him little better than a
tributary prince under his artful benefactor.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t memorable and mo&s;t fortunate event,
which di&s;tingui&s;hed the reign of this great prince, was
the introduction of the Chri&s;tian religion among the Eng|li&s;h
Saxons. The &s;uper&s;tition of the Germans, particu|larly
that of the Saxons, was of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t bar|barous
kind; and being founded on certain traditional
tales, received from their ance&s;tors, not reduced to any
&s;y&s;tem, not &s;upported by political in&s;titutions, like that
of the Druids, it &s;eems to have made little impre&s;&s;ion on
its votaries, and to have ea&s;ily re&s;igned its place to the
new doctrine, promulgated to them. Woden, whom
they believed the ance&s;tor of all their princes, was regard|ed
as the god of war, and, by a natural con&s;equence, be|came
their &s;upreme deity, and the chief object of their re|ligious
wor&s;hip. They believed, that, if they obtained
the favour of this divinity by their valour, (for they made
<PB N="31" REF="39">
le&s;s account of the other virtues) they would be ad|mitted
after their death into his hall, and repo&s;ing on
couches, would &s;atiate them&s;elves with ale from the &s;kulls
of their enemies, whom they had &s;lain in battle. In|cited
by this idea of paradi&s;e, which gratified at once
the pa&s;&s;ion of revenge and that of intemperance, the
ruling inclinations of barbarians, they de&s;pi&s;ed the dan|gers
of war, and encrea&s;ed their native ferocity again&s;t
the vanqui&s;hed by their religious prejudices. We know
little of the other theological tenets of the Saxons: We
only learn that they were idolaters; that they wor&s;hip|ped
the &s;un and moon; that they adored the god of
thunder, under the name of Thor; that they had ima|ges
in their temples; that they practi&s;ed &s;acrifices; be|lieved
firmly in &s;pells and inchantments; and admitted in
general a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines, which they held as &s;acred,
but which, like all other &s;uper&s;titions, mu&s;t bear the air
of the wilde&s;t extravagance, if propounded to tho&s;e who
are not familiarized to it from their earlie&s;t infancy.</P>
<P>THE con&s;tant ho&s;tilities which the Saxons maintained
again&s;t the Britains, would naturally indi&s;po&s;e them from
receiving the Chri&s;tian faith, when preached to them by
&s;uch inveterate enemies; and perhaps the Britains, as is
objected to them by Gildas and Bede, were not over|fond
of communicating to their cruel invaders the doc|trine
of eternal life and &s;alvation. But as a civilized
people, however &s;ubdued by arms, &s;till maintain a &s;en|&s;ible
&s;uperiority over barbarous and ignorant nations, all
the other northern conquerors of Europe had been al|ready
induced to embrace the Chri&s;tian faith, which they
found e&s;tabli&s;hed in the empire; and it was impo&s;&s;ible
but the Saxons, informed of this event, mu&s;t have re|garded
with &s;ome degree of veneration a doctrine which
had acquired the a&s;cendant over all their brethren. How|ever
limited in their views, they could not but have per|ceived
a degree of cultivation in the &s;outhern counties
<PB N="32" REF="40">
beyond what they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and it was na|tural
for them to yield to that &s;uperior knowlege, as well
as zeal, by which the inhabitants of the Chri&s;tian king|doms
were even at this time di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e cau&s;es might long have failed of operating
their effect, had not a favourable incident prepared the
means of introducing Chri&s;tianity into Kent. Ethelbert,
in his father's lifetime, had married Bertha, the only
daughter of Caribert, king of Paris<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Greg. of Tours, lib. 9. cap. 26. H. Hunting. lib. 2.</NOTE>, one of the de&s;cend|ants
of Clovis, the conqueror of Gaul; but before he
was admitted to this alliance, he was obliged to &s;tipulate,
that the prince&s;s &s;hould enjoy the free exerci&s;e of her re|ligion;
a conce&s;&s;ion not difficult to be obtained from
the idolatrous Saxons<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 25. Brompton, p. 729.</NOTE>. Bertha brought over a French
bi&s;hop to the court of Canterbury; and being zealous for
the propagation of her religion, &s;he had been very a&s;&s;i|duous
in her devotional exerci&s;es, had &s;upported the
credit of her faith by an irreproachable conduct, and had
employed every art of in&s;inuation and addre&s;s to recon|cile
her hu&s;band to her religious principles. Her popu|larity
in the court, and her influence over Ethelbert,
had &s;o well paved the way for the reception of the Chri&s;|tian
doctrine, that Gregory, &s;irnamed the Great, the
pre&s;ent Roman pontiff, began to entertain hopes of ef|fectuating
a project, which he him&s;elf, before he mounted
the papal throne, had once embraced for converting the
Briti&s;h Saxons.</P>
<P>IT happened, that this prelate, being then in a pri|vate
&s;tation, had ob&s;erved in the market-place of Rome
&s;ome Saxon youths expo&s;ed to &s;ale, whom the Roman
merchants, in their trading voyages to Britain, had
bought of their mercenary parents. Struck with the
beauty of their fair complexions and blooming counte|nances,
<PB N="33" REF="41">
Gregory a&s;ked to what country they belonged;
and being told they were <HI>Angles,</HI> he replied, that they
ought more properly to be denominated <HI>angels;</HI> and it
was a pity that the Prince of Darkne&s;s &s;hould enjoy &s;o
fair a prey, and that &s;o beautiful a fronti&s;piece &s;hould
cover a mind devoid of internal grace and righteou&s;ne&s;s.
Enquiring farther concerning the name of their province,
he was informed, that it was De&iuml;ri, a divi&s;ion of Nor|thumberland:
<HI>De&iuml;ri!</HI> replied he, <HI>that is good! They are
called to the mercy of God from his anger,</HI> De ira. <HI>But
what is the name of the King of that province?</HI> He was
told it was <HI>Aella</HI> or <HI>Alla; Alleluiah,</HI> cried he <HI>We mu&s;t
endeavour that the prai&s;es of God be &s;ung in their country.</HI>
Moved by the&s;e allu&s;ions, which appeared to him &s;o
happy, he determined to undertake him&s;elf a mi&s;&s;ion into
Britain; and having obtained the Pope's permi&s;&s;ion, he
prepared for that dangerous journey: But his popularity
at home was &s;o great, that the Romans, unwilling to
expo&s;e him to &s;uch hazards, oppo&s;ed his de&s;ign; and he
was obliged for the pre&s;ent to lay a&s;ide farther thoughts
of executing that pious purpo&s;e<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 1. Spell. Conc. p. 91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE controver&s;y between the Pagans and the Chri&s;ti|ans
was not entirely cooled in that age; and no pontiff
before Gregory had ever carried to greater exce&s;&s;es his
intemperate zeal again&s;t the former religion. He had de|clared
war again&s;t all the precious monuments of the an|tients,
and even again&s;t their writings; which, as ap|pears
from the &s;train of his own wit, as well as the &s;tyle
of his compo&s;itions, he had not ta&s;te nor genius &s;uffi|cient
to comprehend. Ambitious to di&s;tingui&s;h his pon|tificate
by the conver&s;ion of the Briti&s;h Saxons, he pitch|ed
on Augu&s;tine, a Roman monk, and &s;ent him with
forty a&s;&s;ociates to preach the go&s;pel in this i&s;land. The&s;e
mi&s;&s;ionaries, terrified with the dangers, which might
<PB N="34" REF="42">
attend their propo&s;ing a new doctrine to &s;o fierce a
people, of who&s;e language they were entirely ignorant,
&s;topped &s;ome time in France, and &s;ent back Augu&s;tine
to lay the hazards and difficulties before the Pope, and
crave his permi&s;&s;ion to de&s;i&s;t from the undertaking. But
Gregory exhorted them to per&s;evere in their purpo&s;e,
advi&s;ed them to chu&s;e &s;ome interpreters from among the
Franks, who &s;till &s;poke the &s;ame language with the
Saxons<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 23,</NOTE>, and recommended them to the good offices of
Queen Brunehaut, who had at this time u&s;urped the &s;o|vereign
power in their, country. This prince&s;s, tho'
&s;tained with every vice of treachery and cruelty, either
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or pretended great zeal for the cau&s;e; and Gre|gory
acknowledged, that to her friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance was
in a great mea&s;ure owing the &s;ucce&s;s of that undertak|ing<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Greg. Epi&s;t. lib. 9. epi&s;t. 56. Spell. Conc. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AUGUSTINE, on his arrival in Kent in the year 597<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Higden, Polychron. lib. 5. Chron. Sax. p. 23.</NOTE>,
found the danger much le&s;s than he had apprehended.
Ethelbert, already well-di&s;po&s;ed towards the Chri&s;tian
faith, a&s;&s;igned him a habitation in the i&s;le of Thanet;
and &s;oon after admitted him to a conference. Appre|hen&s;ive,
however, that &s;pells or enchantments might be
employed again&s;t him by prie&s;ts, who brought an un|known
wor&s;hip from a di&s;tant country, he took the pre|caution
of receiving them in the open air, where he be|lieved
the force of their magic would be more ea&s;ily di&s;|&s;ipated<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. $. cap. 25. H. Hunting. lib. 3. Brompton, p. 729. Parker Antiq. Brit. Eccl. p. 61.</NOTE>. Here Augu&s;tine, by means of his interpre|ters,
delivered to him the tenets of the Chri&s;tian, faith,

replied Ethelbert, &startq;are fair; but becau&s;e, they are new
and uncertain, I cannot entirely yield to them, and
relinqui&s;h the principles, which I and my ance&s;tors
have &s;o long maintained. You are welcome, how|ever,
to remain here in peace; and as you. have un|dertaken
&s;o long a journey, &s;olely, as appears, for

you with all nece&s;&s;aries, and permit you to deliver

<P>AUGUSTINE, encouraged by this favourable recep|tion,
and &s;eeing now a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, proceeded
with redoubled zeal to preach the go&s;pel to the Kenti&s;h
Saxons. He attracted their attention by the au&s;terity of
his manners, by the &s;evere penances to which he &s;ub|jected
him&s;elf, by the ab&s;tinence and &s;elf-denial which
he practi&s;ed: And having excited their wonder by a
cour&s;e of life, which appeared &s;o contrary to nature, he
procured more ea&s;ily their belief for miracles, which, it
was pretended, he wrought for their conversion<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 26.</NOTE>. In|fluenced
by the&s;e motives, and by the declared favour of
the court, numbers of the Kenti&s;h men were baptized;
and the King him&s;elf was per&s;uaded to &s;ubmit to that
rite of Chri&s;tianity. His example wrought powerfully
on his &s;ubjects; but he employed no force to bring them
over to the new doctrine. Augu&s;tine thought proper, in
the commencement of his mi&s;&s;ion, to a&s;&s;ume the ap|pearance
of the greate&s;t lenity; and he told Ethelbert,
that the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t mu&s;t be entirely Voluntary, and
that no violence ought ever to be u&s;ed in propagating &s;o
&s;alutary a doctrine<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 26. H. Hunting. $b. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE intelligence received of the&s;e &s;piritual conque&s;ts
conveyed great joy to the Romans; who now exulted
<PB N="36" REF="44">
as much in tho&s;e peaceful trophies, as their ance&s;tors
had ever done in their mo&s;t &s;anguinary triumphs, and
mo&s;t &s;plendid victories. Gregory wrote a letter to Ethel|bert,
in which, after informing him, that the end of
the world was approaching, he exhorted him to di&s;play
his zeal in the conver&s;ion of his &s;ubjcts, to exert rigour
again&s;t the wor&s;hip of idols, and to build up the good
work of holine&s;s by every expedient of exhortation, ter|ror,
blandi&s;hment or correction<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 32. Brompton, p. 732. Spell Conc. p. 86.</NOTE>: A doctrine more &s;uit|able
to that age, and to the u&s;ual papal maxims, than
the tolerating principles which Augu&s;tine had thought it
prudent to inculcate. The pontiff al&s;o an&s;wered &s;ome
que&s;tions, which the mi&s;&s;ionary had put concerning the
government of the new church of England. Be&s;ides
other queries, which it is not nece&s;&s;ary here to relate,
Augu&s;tine a&s;ked, <HI>Whether cou&s;in-germans might be allowed
to marry?</HI> Gregory an&s;wered, that that liberty had in|deed
been formerly granted by the Roman law; but
that experience had &s;hown, that no po&s;terity could ever
come from &s;uch marriages; and he therefore prohibited
them. Augu&s;tine a&s;ks, <HI>Whether a woman pregnant might
be baptized?</HI> Gregory an&s;wers, that he &s;ees no objection.
<HI>How &s;oon after the birth the child might receive bapti&s;m?</HI>
It was an&s;wered, Immediately, if requi&s;ite. <HI>How &s;oon
a hu&s;band might have commerce with his wife after her deli|very?</HI>
Not till &s;he had given &s;uck to her child; a prac|tice
to which Gregory exhorts all women. <HI>How &s;oon a
man might enter the church, or receive the &s;acrament, after
having had commerce with his wife?</HI> It was replied, that
unle&s;s he had approached her without de&s;ire, merely for
the &s;ake of propagating his &s;pecies, he was not free from
&s;in; but in all ca&s;es it was requi&s;ite for him, before he
entered the church, or communicated, to purge him&s;elf
by prayer and ablution; and ought not, even after u&s;ing
the&s;e precautions, to participate immediately of the &s;a|cred

Saxons.</P>
<P>THE more to facilitate the reception of Chri&s;tianity,
Gregory injoined Augu&s;tine to remove the idols from the
Heathen altars, but not to de&s;troy the altars them&s;elves;
becau&s;e the people, he &s;aid, would be allured to fre|quent
the Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, when they found it cele|brated
in a place, which they were accu&s;tomed to revere
as &s;acred. And as the Pagans practi&s;ed &s;acrifices, and
fea&s;ted with the prie&s;ts on their offerings, he al&s;o ex|horted
the mi&s;&s;ionary to per&s;uade them, on Chri&s;tian fe&s;|tivals,
to kill their cattle in the neighbourhood of the
church, and to indulge them&s;elves in tho&s;e cheerful en|tertainments

<P>THE marriage of Ethelbert with Bertha, and much
more his embracing Chri&s;tianity, begot a connexion of
his &s;ubjects with the French, Italians, and other nations
on the continent, and tended to reclaim them from that

the kingdom of Kent fifty years; and dying in
616<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. P. 25.</NOTE>, left the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his &s;on, Eadbald. This

for &s;ome time the Chri&s;tian faith, -which permitted
not the&s;e ince&s;tuous marriages; and his whole people
immediately returned with him to idolatry. Lauren|tius,
the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Augu&s;tine, found the Chri&s;tian
wor&s;hip wholly abandoned, and was preparing to return
into France, in order to &s;ave him&s;elf the mortification of
preaching the go&s;pel without fruit to the infidels. Mel|litus

He appeared before that prince; and throwing off his

&s;tripes, which he had received. Eadbald, wondering
that any man &s;hould have dared to treat in that manner

had received this cha&s;ti&s;ement fromt $t. Peter, the prince
of the apo&s;tles, who had appeared to him in a vi&s;ion, and
&s;everely reproving him for his intention to de&s;ert his

hitherto been allowed a toleration by the two preceding
monarchs. He reigned twenty-four years; and left the
crown to Egbert, his &s;on, who reigned nine years.

began to prevail among the nobility; which invited
Cedwalla, King of We&s;&s;ex, with his brother Mollo, to

<HEAD>The Kingdom of NORTHUMBERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>ADELFRID, King of Bernicia, having married Acca,
the daughter of Aella, Kling of De&iuml;ri, and expelled
her infant brother, Edwin, had united all the counties
north of Humber, into one monarchy, and acquired a
great a&s;cendant in the heptarchy. He al&s;o &s;pread the
terror of the Saxon arms to the neighbouring people;
and by his victories over the Scots and Picts, as well as
Wel&s;h, extended on all &s;ides the bounds of his domi|nions.
Having laid &s;iege to Che&s;ter, the Britains marched
out with all their forces to engage him; and they were
attended with a body of 1250 monks from the mona&s;tery
of Bangor, who &s;tood at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the field
of battle, in order to encourage the combatants by their
pre&s;ence and exhortations. Adelfrid enquiring about
the purpo&s;e of this unu&s;ual appearance, was told, that
the&s;e prie&s;ts had come to pray again&s;t him: <HI>Then they are
as much our enemies,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>as tho&s;e who intend to fight
again&s;t us</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 779.</NOTE>: And he immediately &s;ent a detachment, who
fell upon them, and committed &s;uch &s;laughter, that only
fifty e&s;caped with their lives<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Trivet. apud Spell. Conc. P. 111.</NOTE>. The Britains, a&s;toni&s;hed
with this event, received a total defeat: Che&s;ter was
obliged to &s;urrender: And Adelfrid, pur&s;uing his victory,
made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Bangor, and entirely demoli&s;hed
the mona&s;tery. It was &s;o va&s;t a building, that there was
a mile's di&s;tance from one gate of it to another; and it
contained two thou&s;and one hundred monks, who are
<PB N="42" REF="50">
&s;aid to have been there maintained by the fruits of their
own labour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 2. W. Malme&s;. lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING Adelfrid's &s;ucce&s;s in war, he
lived in inquietude on account of young Edwin, whom
he had unju&s;tly di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the crown of De&iuml;ri. This
prince, now grown to man's e&s;tate, wandered from place
to place, in continual danger from the attempts of Adel|frid;
and received at la&s;t protection in the court of Red|wald,
King of the Ea&s;t-Angles; where his engaging and
gallant deportment procured him the affections of every
one. Redwald, however, was &s;trongly &s;olicited by the
King of Northumberland to kill or deliver up his gue&s;t:
Rich pre&s;ents were promi&s;ed him, if he would comply;
and war denounced again&s;t him, in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al.
After rejecting &s;everal me&s;&s;ages of this kind, his gene|ro&s;ity
began to yield to the motives of intere&s;t; and he
retained the la&s;t amba&s;&s;ador, till he &s;hould come to a re|&s;olution
in a ca&s;e of &s;uch importance. Edwin, informed
of his friend's he&s;itation, was yet determined at all haz|ards
to remain in Ea&s;t-Anglia; and thought, that if the
protection of that court failed him, it were better to die
than prolong a life &s;o much expo&s;ed to the per&s;ecutions
of his powerful rival. This confidence in Redwald's
honour and friend&s;hip, with his other accompli&s;hments,
engaged the Queen on his &s;ide; and &s;he effectually re|pre&s;ented
to her hu&s;band the infamy of delivering up to
certain de&s;truction tbeir royal gue&s;t, who had fled to them
for protection again&s;t his cruel and jealous enemies<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 1. cap. 3. H. Hunting lib. 3. Bede.</NOTE>.
Redwald, therefore, embracing more generous re&s;olu|tions,
thought it &s;afe&s;t to prevent Adelfrid, before he was
aware of his intention, and to attack him while he was
yet unprepared for defence. He marched &s;uddenly with
an army into the kingdom of Northumberland, and
<PB N="43" REF="51">
fought a battle with Adelfrid; where that monarch was
defeated and killed, after revenging him&s;elf by the death
of Regner, &s;on to Redwald<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 12. Brompton, p. 781.</NOTE>. His own &s;ons, Eanfrid,
O&s;wald, and O&s;wy, yet infants, fled into Scotland; and
Edwin obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown of Northumber|land.</P>
<P>EDWIN was the greate&s;t prince of the heptarchy dur|ing
his time, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, both by his in|fluence
over the other kingdoms<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 27.</NOTE>, and by the &s;trict exe|cution
of ju&s;tice in his own dominions. He reclaimed
his &s;ubjects from the licentious life to which they had
been habituated; and it was a common &s;aying, that in
his reign a woman or child might openly carry every
where a pur&s;e of gold, without any danger of violence
of robbery<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 2. Bede, W. Malme&s;.</NOTE>. There is a remarkable in&s;tance, tran&s;mit|ted
to us, of the affection borne him by his &s;ervants.
Cuichelme, King of We&s;&s;ex, was his enemy; and find|ing
him&s;elf unable to maintain open war again&s;t &s;o gal|lant
and powerful a prince, he determined to make u&s;e
of treachery again&s;t him, and he employed one Eumer
for that criminal purpo&s;e. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, having obtained
admittance, by pretending to deliver a me&s;&s;age from Cui|chelme,
drew his dagger, and ru&s;hed upon the King.
Lilla, an officer of his army, &s;eeing his ma&s;ter's danger,
and having no other means of defence, interpo&s;ed with
his own body between the King and Eumer's dagger,
which was pu&s;hed with &s;uch violence, that, after pierc|ing
Lilla, it even wounded Edwin: And before the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in
could renew his blow, he was di&s;patched by the
guards<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. cap. 9. Chron. Sax. p. 27. Higden, lib. 5. H. Hunting. lib. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Ea&s;t-Angles con&s;pired again&s;t Redwald, their
King; and having put him to death, they offered their
<PB N="44" REF="52">
crown to Edwin, of who&s;e valour and capacity they had had
experience, while he re&s;ided among them. But
Edwin, &s;en&s;ible of gratitude towards his benefactor,
obliged them to &s;ubmit to Earpwold, the &s;on of Red|wald;
and that prince pre&s;erved his authority, tho' on
a precarious footing, under the protection of the Nor|thumbrian
monarch<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gul. Malmef. lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EDWIN, after his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, married
Ethelburga, the daughter of Ethelbert, King of Kent;
and this prince&s;s, emulating the glory of her mother
Bertha, who had been the in&s;trument of converting her
hu&s;band and his people to Chri&s;tianity, carried Paulli|nus,
a learned bi&s;hop, along with her<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 3.</NOTE>; and be&s;ides &s;ti|pulating
a toleration for the exerci&s;e of her own reli|gion,
which was readily granted her, &s;he u&s;ed every
rea&s;on to per&s;uade the King to embrace it. Edwin, like
a prudent prince, he&s;itated on the propo&s;al; but pro|mi&s;ed
to examine the foundations of that doctrine; and
if he found them &s;atisfactrory, he declared him&s;elf willing
to be converted<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 9.</NOTE>. Accordingly he held &s;everal confer|ences
with Paullinus, canva&s;&s;ed the arguments propound|ed
with the wi&s;e&s;t of his coun&s;ellors, retired frequently
from company, in order to revolve alone that import|ant

in favour of the Chri&s;tian religion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 9. Malme&s;. lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE>. The people
&s;oon after imitated his example. Be&s;ides the authority
and influence of the King, they were moved by another
&s;triking example. Coifi, the high prie&s;t, being con|verted
after a public conference with Paullinus, led the
way in de&s;troying the images, which he had &s;o long

<P>MERCIA, the large&s;t, if not the mo&s;t powerful

Wibba, the &s;on of Crida, founder of the monarchy,
being placed on the throne by Ethelbert, King of Kent,
governed his paternal dominions by a very precarious au|thority;
and after his death, Ceorl, his kin&s;man, was,
by the influence of the Kenti&s;h monarch, preferred to his

experience, or reflection. He engaged in continual ho&s;|tilities
again&s;t all the neighbouring &s;tates; and by his

his own &s;ubjects and to &s;trangers. Sigebert, Egric, and

enterprizes again&s;t Lothaire, King of Kent, and Ken|wulph,
King of We&s;&s;ex. He defeated the former in a
bloody battle at Otford upon the Darent, and reduced
his kingdom to a &s;tate of dependance: He gained a vic|tory
over the latter at Ben&s;ington in Oxford&s;hire; and
conquering that county, together with that of Gloce&s;ter,
annexed it to his other dominions. But all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;|&s;es
were &s;tained by his treacherous murder of Ethelbert,
King of the Ea&s;t-Angles, and his violent &s;eizure of that
kingdom. This young prince, who is &s;aid to have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
great merit, had made &s;uit to Elfrida, the daugh|ter

joy and fe&s;tivity of the&s;e entertainments, he was &s;eized

abhorred her father's treachery, had time to give warn|ing

The treacherous prince, de&s;irous of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing his
character in the world, and perhaps of appea&s;ing the re|mor&s;es
of his own con&s;cience, payed great court to the
clergy, and practi&s;ed all the monki&s;h devotions, which
were &s;o much e&s;teemed in that ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious
age. He gave the tenth of all his goods to the church<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Spell. Conc. P. 308. Brompton, p. 776.</NOTE>;
be&s;towed rich donations on the cathedral of Hereford;
and even made a pilgrimage to Rome, where his great
power and riches could not fail of procuring him the pa|pal
ab&s;olution. The better to ingratiate him&s;elf with the
<PB N="51" REF="59">

a yearly donation for the &s;upport of an Engli&s;h col|lege

intitled to the crown, and becau&s;e he had acquired, to
an eminent degree, the affections of the people. Egbert,
&s;en&s;ible of his danger from the &s;u&s;picions of Brithric, with|drew
&s;ecretly into France<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 4.</NOTE>; where he was well received

court, and &s;erving in the armies of that prince, the mo&s;t

proved thus of infinite advantage to him.</P>
<P>IT was not long before Egbert had opportunities of
di&s;playing his natural and acquired talents. Brithric,
King of We&s;&s;ex, had married Eadburga, natural daugh|ter<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 749, 750. W. Malme&s;. lib. 1. cap. 2. H. Hunting. lib. 4.</NOTE>
of Offa, King of Mercia, a profligate woman,
equally infamous for cruelty and for incontinence. Ha|ving
great influence over her hu&s;band, &s;he often incited
him to de&s;troy &s;uch of the nobility as were obnoxious to
her; and where this expedient failed her, &s;he &s;crupled
not being her&s;elf active in traiterous attempts upon their
life. She had mixed a cup of poi&s;on for a young noble|man,
who had acquired her hu&s;band's friend&s;hip, and
had on that account become the object of her jealou&s;y:
But unfortunately, the King drank of the fatal cup along

joined to her other crimes, rendered Eadburga &s;o odious,

a&s;cend the throne of his ance&s;tors<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. A. D. 800. Brompton, p. 801.</NOTE>. He attained that

From this fatal cau&s;e, together with the admiration of
the mona&s;tic life, and the opinion of merit, attending the
pre&s;ervation of cha&s;tity even in a married &s;tate, the royal
families had been entirely extingui&s;hed in all the king|doms
except that of We&s;&s;ex; and the emulations, &s;u&s;pi|cions,
and con&s;piracies, which had formerly been con|fined
to the princes of the blood alone, were now diffu&s;ed
among all the nobility in the &s;everal Saxon &s;tates. Eg|bert
was the &s;ole de&s;cendant of tho&s;e fir&s;t conquerors who
&s;ubdued Britain, and who enhanced their authority by
claiming a pedigree from Woden, the &s;upreme divinity of
their ance&s;tors. But that prince, tho' invited by this fa|vourable
circum&s;tance to make attempts on the neighbour|ing
Saxons, gave them for &s;ome time no di&s;turbance,
and rather cho&s;e to turn his arms again&s;t the Britains in
Cornwal, whom he defeated in &s;everal battles<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 69.</NOTE>. He was
recalled from the conque&s;t of that country by an inroad
made into his dominions by Bernulf, King of Mercia.</P>
<P>THE Mercians, before the acce&s;&s;ion of Egbert, had
very nearly attained the ab&s;olute &s;overeignty over the
heptarchy: They had reduced the Ea&s;t-Angles under-&s;ub|jection,
and e&s;tabli&s;hed tributary princes in the king|doms
of Kent and E&s;&s;ex. Northumberland was involved
in anarchy; and no &s;tate of any con&s;equence remained
but that of We&s;&s;ex, which, much inferior in extent to
Mercia, was &s;upported by the great qualities of its &s;ove|reign
alone. Egbert led his army again&s;t the invaders;
and encountering them at Ellandun in Wilt&s;hire, obtain|ed
a complete victory, and by the &s;laughter executed on
them in their flight, gave a mortal blow to the power of
the Mercians. Whil&s;t he him&s;elf, in pro&s;ecution of his

from their hatred to the Mercian government,
which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed over them by treachery and
violence, and probably exerci&s;ed with tyranny, imme|diately
ro&s;e in arms, and craved the protection of Eg|bert<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ethelwerd, lib. 3. cap. 3.</NOTE>.
Bernulf, the Mercian King, who marched
again&s;t them, was defeated and &s;lain; and two years af|ter,

The&s;e in&s;urrections and calamities facilitated the enterpri|zes

territories, and made ea&s;y conque&s;ts over a di&s;heart|ened

the real powers of &s;overeignty<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ingulph. p. 7, 8, 10.</NOTE>. The anarchy,

unable to re&s;i&s;t his power, and de&s;irous of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome

as he had done to Mercia and Ea&s;t-Anglia, the
power of electing a King, who paid him tribute, and was
dependant on him.</P>
<P>THUS were united all the kingdoms of the heptarchy
in one great &s;tate, near four hundred years after the fir&s;t
arrival of the Saxons in Britain; and the fortunate arms
and prudent policy of Egbert at la&s;t effectuated what had
been &s;o often attempted in vain by &s;o many princes<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 71.</NOTE>
Kent, Northumberland, and Mercia, which had &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively
<PB N="62" REF="72">
a&s;pired to general dominion, were now incorpo|rated
in his empire; and the other &s;ubordinate kingdoms
&s;eemed wiliingly to &s;hare the &s;ame fate. His territories
were nearly of the &s;ame extent with what is now proper|ly
denominated England; and a favourable pro&s;pect was
afforded the Anglo-Saxons, of e&s;tabli&s;hing a civilized
monarchy, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tranquillity within it&s;elf, and &s;e|cure
again&s;t foreign inva&s;ion. This great event happen|ed
in the year 827<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Saxons, tho' they had been &s;o long &s;ettled in the
i&s;land, &s;eem not as yet to have been much improved be|yond
their German ance&s;tors, either in arts, civility,
knowledge, humanity, ju&s;tice, or obedience to the laws.
Even Chri&s;tianity, tho', among other advantages, it open|ed
the way to connexions between them and the more
poli&s;hed &s;tates of Europe, had not hitherto been very ef|fectual,
in bani&s;hing their ignorance, or &s;oftening their
barbarous manners. As they received that doctrine thro'
the corrupted channels of Rome, which had &s;trongly
tinctured the original purity of the Chri&s;tian faith, it car|ried
along with it a great mixture of credulity and &s;uper|&s;tition,
equally de&s;tructive to the under&s;tanding and to
morals. The reverence towards &s;aints and reliques &s;eems
to have almo&s;t &s;upplanted the adoration of the &s;upreme
Being: Mona&s;tic ob&s;ervances were e&s;teemed more meri|torious
than the active virtues: The knowledge of
natural cau&s;es was neglected from the univer&s;al belief
of miraculous interpo&s;itions and judgments: Bounty to
the church atoned for all violences again&s;t &s;ociety: And
the remor&s;es for cruelty, murder, treachery, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination,
and the more robu&s;t vices, were appea&s;ed, not by amend|ment
of life, but by penances, &s;ervility to the monks,
and an abject and illiberal devotion<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The&s;e abu&s;es were common to all the European churches; but th$ prie&s;ts in Italy, Spain, and Gaul, made &s;ome atonement for them by other advantages, which they rendered &s;ociety. For &s;everal ages, they were almo&s;t all Romans, or, in other words, the antient natives; and they pre&s;erved the Roman language and laws, with &s;ome remains of the former civility. But the prie&s;ts in the heptarchy, after the fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ion|aries, were wholly Saxon, and almo&s;t as ignorant and barbarous as the laity. They contributed, therefore, little to the improvement of the &s;o|ciety in knowledge or the arts.</NOTE>. The reverence for
<PB N="63" REF="73">
the clergy had mounted &s;o high, that wherever a per&s;on
appeared in a &s;acerdotal habit, tho' on the high way, the
people flocked around him; and &s;howing him all marks
of profound re&s;pect, received every word he uttered as the
mo&s;t &s;acred oracles<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 3. cap. 26.</NOTE>. Even the military virtues, &s;o inhe|rent
in all the Saxon tribes, began to be neglected; and
the nobility, preferring the &s;ecurity and &s;loth of the cloy|&s;ter
to the tumults and glory of war, valued them&s;elves
chiefly on the endowment of mona&s;teries, of which they
a&s;&s;umed the government<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 23. Epi&s;to|la Bedae ad Egbert.</NOTE>. The crown too, being ex|tremely
impoveri&s;hed by continual benefactions to the
church, to which the &s;tates of the kingdom weakly con|&s;ented,
could be&s;tow no rewards on valour or military
&s;ervices, and retained not even &s;ufficient influence to &s;up|port
the government<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Bedae. Epi&s;t. ad Egbort.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER inconvenience, which attended this corrupt
&s;pecies of Chri&s;tianity, was the &s;uper&s;titious attachment
to Rome, and the gradual &s;ubjection of the kingdom to a
foreign juri&s;diction. The Britains had never acknow|ledged
any &s;ubordination to the Roman pontiff, and had
conducted all eccle&s;ia&s;tical government by their dome&s;tic
&s;ynods and councils<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Append, to Bede, numb. 10. ex edit. 1722. Spelm. Conc. p. 108, 109.</NOTE>: But the Saxons, receiving their
religion from Roman monks, were taught at the &s;ame
time a pro&s;ound reverence to that &s;ee, and were naturally
led to regard it as the capital of their religion. Pil|grimages
<PB N="64" REF="74">
to Rome were repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t meritori|ous
acts of devotion. Not only noblemen and ladies of
rank undertook this tedious journey<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap 7.</NOTE>; but Kings them|selves,
abdicating their crowns, &s;ought for a &s;ecure pa&s;&s;|port
to heaven at the feet of the Roman pontiff. New
reliques, continually &s;ent from that endle&s;s mint of &s;uper|&s;tition,
and magnified by lying miracles, invented in
convents, operated on the a&s;toni&s;hed minds of the multi|tude:
And every prince attained the eulogies of the
monks, the only hi&s;torians of tho&s;e ages, not in p$opor|tion
to his civil and military virtues, but to his devoted
attachment towards their order, and his &s;uper&s;titious re|verence
for Rome.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign pontiff, encouraged by this blindne&s;s
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition of the people, advanced every
day in his enterprizes on the independance of the Eng|li&s;h
churches. Wilfrid, bi&s;hop of Lindisferne, the &s;ole
prelate of the Northumbrian kingdom, gave the fini&s;h|ing
&s;troke to this &s;ubjection in the eighth century, by his
making an appeal to Rome again&s;t the deci&s;ions of an
Engli&s;h &s;ynod, which had abridged his dioce&s;e by the
erection of &s;ome new bi&s;hoprics<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See Appendix to Bede, numb. 19. Higden, lib. 5. Matth. We&s;t. p. 124. Brompton, p. 793, 794.</NOTE>. Agatho, the pope,
readily embraced this precedent of an appeal to his court;
and Wilfrid, though the haughtie&s;t and mo&s;t luxurious
prelate of his age<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eddius vita Vilfr, &sect; 24, 60.</NOTE>, having obtained with the people the
character of &s;anctity, finally prevailed in the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>THE great topic, by which he confounded the imag$ i|nations
of men, was, that St. Peter, to who&s;e cu&s;tody
the keys of heaven were entru&s;ted, would certainly re|fu&s;e
admittance to every one who had been wanting in
re&s;pect to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This conceit, well calculated
for vulgar conceptions, had a powerful operation on the
<PB N="64" REF="75">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="65" REF="76">
people during &s;everal ages; and has not even at pre&s;ent
lo&s;t all influence in the catholic countries.</P>
<P>HAD this abject &s;uper&s;tition produced general peace
and tranquillity, it had made &s;ome atonement for the ills
attending it; but, added to the u&s;ual avidity of men for
power and riches, it engendered frivolous controver&s;ies
in theology, which were &s;o much the more fatal, as they
admitted not, like the others, of any final determination
from e&s;tabli&s;hed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The di&s;putes, excited in Bri|tain,
were of the mo&s;t ridiculous kind, and entirely wor|thy
of tho&s;e ignorant and barbarous ages. There were
&s;ome intricacies, ob&s;erved by all the Chri&s;tian churches,
in adju&s;ting the day of keeping Ea&s;ter; which depended
on a complicated con&s;ideration of the cour&s;e of the &s;un
and moon: And it happened that the mi&s;&s;ionaries, who
had converted the Scots and Britains, had followed a dif|ferent
calendar from what was ob&s;erved at Rome in the
age when Augu&s;tine converted the Saxons. The prie&s;ts
al&s;o of all the Chri&s;tian churches were accu&s;tomed to &s;have
part of their head; but the form given to this &s;ton&s;ure,
was different in the former from what was practi&s;ed in
the latter. The Scots and Britains pleaded the antiquity
of <HI>their</HI> u&s;ages: The Romans, and their di&s;ciples, the
Saxons, in&s;i&s;ted on the univer&s;ality of <HI>theirs.</HI> That Ea&s;|ter
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be kept by a rule, which compre|hended
both the day of the year and age of the moon,
was agreed by all; that the &s;having of a prie&s;t could not
be omitted without the utmo&s;t impiety, was a point un|di&s;puted:
But the Romans and Saxons called their anta|goni&s;ts
&s;chi&s;matics; becau&s;e they celebrated Ea&s;ter on the
very day of the full moon in March, if that day fell on
a Sunday, in&s;tead of waiting till the Sunday following;
and becau&s;e they &s;haved their whole forehead from ear to
ear, in&s;tead of making that ton&s;ure on the crown of the
head, and in a circular form. In order to render their
<PB N="65" REF="77">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="66" REF="78">
antagoni&s;ts odious, they affirmed, that once in &s;even
years they concurred with the Jews in the time of cele|brating
that fe&s;tival<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 19.</NOTE>: And that they might recommend
their own form of ton&s;ure, they maintained, that it imi|tated
&s;ymbolically the crown of thorns worn by our Savi|our
in his pa&s;&s;ion; whereas the latter was invented by
Simon Magus, without any regard to that con&s;ideration<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 21. Eddius, &sect; 24.</NOTE>.
The&s;e controver&s;ies had from the beginning excited &s;uch
animo&s;ity between the Briti&s;h and Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, that,
in&s;tead of concurring in their endeavours to convert the
idolatrous Saxons, they refu&s;ed all communion together,
and each regarded his opponent as no better than a Pa|gan<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 2. cap. 2, 4, 20. Eddius, &sect; 12.</NOTE>. The di&s;pute la&s;ted more than a century; and was

ritual over the Scots and Briti&s;h<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 5. cap. 16, 22.</NOTE>. Wilfrid, bi&s;hop
of Lindisferne, acquired great merit, both with the
court of Rome and with all the &s;outhern Saxons, by ex|pelling
the quartodeciman &s;chi&s;m, as it was called, from

bi&s;hops in Britain<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spell. Conc. vol. 1. p. 168.</NOTE>; where was accepted and ratified the
decree of the Lateran council, &s;ummoned by Martin the
fir&s;t, again&s;t the here&s;y of the Monothelites. The coun|cil
and &s;ynod maintained, in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e heretics,
that tho' the divine and human nature in Chri&s;t made but
one per&s;on; yet had they &s;till different inclinations,
wills, acts, and &s;entiments, and that the unity of the

This opinion it &s;eems &s;omewhat difficult to comprehend;
and no one, unacquainted with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory
of tho&s;e ages, could imagine the height of zeal and vio|lence
with which it was then inculcated. The decree of
the Lateran council calls the Monothelites impious, ex|ecrable,
wicked, abominable, and even diabolical; and

<P>THE Saxons, from the fir&s;t introduction of Chri&s;tiani|ty

had not made &s;o quick a progre&s;s with the&s;e
idolaters: But they had not paid any &s;pecies of wor&s;hip

into one &s;tate under Egbert;<NOTE PLACE="marg">827.</NOTE> and the inhabitants of
the &s;everal provinces had lo&s;t all de&s;ire of revolting from
that conqueror, or of re&s;toring their independant govern|ments.
Their language was every where nearly the
&s;ame; their cu&s;toms, laws, in&s;titutions civil and reli|gious;
and as the race of their antient kings was totally
extinct in all their &s;ubjected &s;tates, the people readily
transferred their allegiance to a prince, who &s;eemed to
merit it, by the &s;plendor of his victories, the vigour of his
admini&s;tration, and the &s;uperior nobility of his birth.
An union al&s;o in government opened to them the agree|able
pro&s;pect of future tranquillity; and it appeared more
probable, that they would thenceforth become terrible to
their neighbours, than be expo&s;ed to their inroads and
<PB N="69" REF="81">
deva&s;tations. But the&s;e flattering views were &s;oon over|ca&s;t
by the appearance of the Danes, who, during &s;ome
centuries, kept the Anglo-Saxons in perpetual inquie|tude,
committed the mo&s;t barbarous ravages upon them,
and at la&s;t reduced them to the mo&s;t grievous &s;ervi|tude.</P>
<P>THE emperor Charlemagne, tho' naturally generous
and humane, had been induced by bigotry to exerci&s;e
great &s;everities again&s;t the pagan Saxons in Germany,
whom he &s;ubdued; and be&s;ides often ravaging their coun|try
by fire and &s;word, he had in cold blood decimated all
the inhabitants for their revolts, and had obliged them,
by the mo&s;t rigorous edicts, to make a &s;eeming compli|ance
with the chri&s;tian doctrine. That religion, which
had ea&s;ily made its way among the Briti&s;h-Saxons by in|&s;inuation
and addre&s;s, appeared &s;hocking to their Ger|man
brethren, when impo&s;ed on them by the violence of
Charlemagne; and the mo&s;t generous and warlike of
the&s;e pagans had fled northward into Jutland, in order to
e&s;cape the fury of his per&s;ecutions. Meeting there with
a people of &s;imilar manners, they were readily received
among them; and they &s;oon &s;timulated the natives to
concur in enterprizes, which both promi&s;ed revenge on
the haughty conquerors, and afforded &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to tho&s;e
numerous inhabitants, with which the northern coun|tries
were now overburthened<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;tria, p. 414.</NOTE>. They invaded the pro|vinces
of France, which were expo&s;ed by the degeneracy
and di&s;&s;entions of Charlemagne's po&s;terity; and being
known there under the general name of Normans, which
they received from their northern &s;ituation, they became
the terror of all the maritime and even of the inland
countries. They were al&s;o tempted to vi&s;it England in
their frequent excur&s;ions; and being able by &s;udden in|roads
<PB N="70" REF="82">
to make great progre&s;s over a people, who were
not defended by any naval force, who had relaxed their
military in&s;titutions, and who were &s;unk into a &s;uper&s;ti|tion,
which had become odious to the Danes and antient
Saxons, they made no di&s;tinction in their ho&s;tilities be|tween
the French and Engli&s;h kingdoms. Their fir&s;t
appearance in this i&s;land was in the year 787<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 6.</NOTE>, when
Brithric reigned in We&s;&s;ex. A &s;mall body of them land|ed
in that kingdom, with a view of learning the &s;tate of
the country; and when the magi&s;trate of the place que&s;|tioned
them concerning the rea&s;on of their enterprize,
and cited them to appear before the king, and account
for their intentions, they killed him, and flying to their
&s;hips, e&s;caped into their own country. The next alarm
was given no Northumberland in the year 794<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 66. Alur. Beverl. p. 108.</NOTE>; when a
body of the&s;e pirates pillaged a mona&s;tery; but their
&s;hips being much damaged by a &s;torm, and their leader
&s;lain in a &s;kirmi&s;h, they were at la&s;t defeated by the inha|bitants,
and the remainder of them put to the &s;word.
Five years after Egbert had e&s;tabli&s;hed his monarchy over
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">832</NOTE> the Danes landed in the I&s;le of Shepey, and
having pillaged it, e&s;caped with impunity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 72. Mat. We&s;t. p. 155.</NOTE>. They were
not &s;o fortunate in their next year's enterprize, when
they di&s;embarked from thirty-five &s;hips, and were en|countered
by Egbert, at Charmouth in Dor&s;et&s;hire.
The battle was bloody; but tho' the Danes lo&s;t great
numbers, they maintained the po&s;t, which they had ta|ken,
and made good their retreat to their &s;hips<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 72. Ethelward, lib. 3. cap. 2. Math. We&s;t. p. 155.</NOTE>. Hav|ing
learned by experience, that they mu&s;t expect a vigo|rous
re&s;i&s;tance from this warlike prince, they entered in|to
an alliance with the Britains of Cornwal; and landing

<P>THIS prince had neither the abilities nor vigour of his

from this partition; as the continual terror of the
Dani&s;h inva&s;ions prevented all dome&s;tic di&s;&s;ention. A

in Ea&s;t-Anglia and Linde&s;ey and Kent<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Math. We&s;t. 156.</NOTE>; where, tho'

obtained their end of committing &s;poil upon the country,
and carrying off their booty. They avoided coming to a
general engagement, which was not &s;uited to their plan
of operations. Their ve&s;&s;els were &s;mall, and ran ea&s;ily
up the creeks and rivers; where they drew them a&s;hore,
and having formed an entrenchment around them, which
they guarded with part of their number, they &s;cattered
them&s;elves every where, and carrying off the inhabitants,
and cattle, and goods, they ha&s;tened to their &s;hips, and
&s;uddenly di&s;appeared. If the military force of the county
was a&s;&s;embled (for there was no time for troops to march
from a di&s;tance) the Danes either were able to repul&s;e
them and to continue their ravages with impunity, or
they betook them&s;elves to their ve&s;&s;els; and &s;etting &s;ail,
invaded &s;uddenly &s;ome di&s;tant quarter, which was not
prepared for their reception. Every part of England was
held in continual alarm; and the inhabitants of one coun|ty
dared not to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e of another, le&s;t

<PB N="75" REF="87">
delivered over to Ethelbald the &s;overeignty of the we&s;t|ern.
And immediately after, he &s;ummoned the &s;tates of
the whole kingdom, and with the &s;ame facility, confer|red
a perpetual and very important donation on the
church.</P>
<P>THE eccle&s;ia&s;tics, in tho&s;e days of ignorance, made
very rapid advances in the acqui&s;ition of power and gran|deur;

doctrines, tho' they met &s;ometimes, from the contrary
intere&s;ts of the laity, with an oppo&s;ition, which it re|quired
time and addre&s;s to overcome, they found no ob|&s;tacle
in their rea&s;on or understanding. Not content with
the donations of land made them by the Saxon princes
and nobles, and with the temporary oblations from, the
devotion of the people, they had ca&s;t a wi&s;hful eye on a
va&s;t revenue, which they claimed as belonging to them
by a divine, indefeizable and inherent title. However
little ver&s;ed in the &s;criptures, they had been able to di&s;co|ver,
that the prie&s;ts, under the Jewi&s;h law, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
tenth of all the produce of land; and forgetting what they
them&s;elves taught, that the moral part only of that law
was obligatory on chri&s;tians, they in&s;i&s;ted, that this do|nation
was a perpetual property, conferred by heaven on
tho&s;e who officiated at the altar. During &s;ome centuries,
the whole &s;cope of &s;ermons and homilies was directed to
this purpo&s;e; and one would have imagined, from the
general tenor of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, that all the practical
parts of chri&s;tianity were comprehended in the exact and
faithful payment of tythes to the clergy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo, &s;opra beneficii eccle&s;ia&s;tici, p. 51, 52. Edit Colon. 1675.</NOTE>. Encouraged
by their &s;ucce&s;s in inculcating the&s;e doctrines; they ven|tured
farther than they were warranted even by the Le|vitical
law, and pretended to draw the tenth of all indu&s;|try,
merchandize, wages of labourers, and pay of &s;ol|diers

Tho' pari&s;hes had been instituted in England by Hono|rius,

favourable opportunity of making that acqui&s;ition; when

would not permit the entrance of more ravagers into the

this treaty, which it &s;eemed the intere&s;t of the Danes

landed, and having collected all the &s;cattered troops of

<P>THIS la&s;t incident quite broke the &s;pirit of the Saxons,
and reduced them to de&s;pair. Finding that, after all
the mi&s;erable havock, which they had undergone in their
per&s;ons and in their property; after all the vigorous ac|tions,
which they had exerted in their own defence; a
new band, equally greedy of &s;poil and &s;laughter, had di&s;|embarked
among them; they believed them&s;elves aban|doned
by heaven to de&s;truction, and delivered over to
tho&s;e &s;warms of robbers, which the fertile north thus in|ce&s;&s;antly
poured forth again&s;t them. Some left their
country, and retired into Wales or fled beyond &s;ea:
Others &s;ubmitted to the conquerors, in hopes of ap|pea&s;ing
their fury by a &s;ervile obedience<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 84. Alured Beverl. p. 105.</NOTE>: And every
man's attention being now engro&s;&s;ed in concern for his
own pre&s;ervation, no one would hearken to the exhor|tations
of the King, who &s;ummoned them to make, un|der
his conduct, one effort more in defence of their
prince, their country, and their liberties. Alfred him|&s;elf
was obliged to relinquish the en&s;igns of his dignity, to
di&s;mi&s;s his &s;ervants, and to &s;eek &s;helter, in the meane&s;t
di&s;gui&s;es, from the pur&s;uit and fury of his enemies. He
concealed him&s;elf under a pea&s;ant's habit, and lived &s;ome
time in the hou&s;e of a neat-herd, who had been entru&s;t|ed
<PB N="84" REF="96">
with the care of &s;ome of his cows<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 9.</NOTE>. There pa&s;&s;ed
here an incident, which has been recorded by all the
hi&s;torians, and was long pre&s;erved by popular tradition;
tho' it contains nothing memorable in it&s;elf, except &s;o
far as every circum&s;tance is intere&s;ting, which attends &s;o
great virtue and dignity, reduced to &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s. The
wife of the neat-herd was ignorant of the condition of her royal gue&s;t; and ob&s;erving him one day bu&s;y by the
&s;ire-fide in trimming his bow and arrows, &s;he de&s;ired him to take care of &s;ome cakes, which were toa&s;ting,
while &s;he was employed el&s;ewhere in other dome&s;tic af|fairs.
But Alfred, who&s;e thoughts were otherwi&s;e en|gaged,
neglected this injunction; and the good woman,
on her return, finding her cakes all burnt, rated the
King very &s;everely; and upbraided him, that he always
&s;eemed very well plea&s;ed to eat her warm cakes, tho' he
was thus negligent in toa&s;ting them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 9. M. We&s;t. p. 170.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY degrees, Alfred, as he found the &s;earch of the ene|my
become more remi&s;s, collected &s;ome of his retainers,
and retired into the center of a bog, formed by the &s;tag|nating
waters of the Thone and Parret, in Somer&s;et|&s;hire.
He here found two acres of firm ground; and
building a habitation on them, rendered him&s;elf &s;ecure
by its fortifications, and &s;till more by the unknown and
inacce&s;&s;ible roads which led to it, and by the fore&s;ts and
mora&s;&s;es, with which it was every way environed. This
place he called. Aethelingey, or the I&s;le of Nobles<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 85. W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. Ethelwerd, lib. 4. cap. 4. Ingulf, p. 26.</NOTE>; and
it now bears the name of Athelney. He thence made
frequent and unexpected fallies upon the Danes, who
often felt the vigour of his arm, but knew not from what
quarter the blow came. He &s;ub&s;i&s;ted him&s;elf and his
followers by the plunder which he acquired; he procur|ed
<PB N="85" REF="97">
them consolation by revenge; and from &s;mall &s;ucce&s;|&s;es,
he opened their minds to hope, that, notwith&s;tand|ing
his pre&s;ent misfortunes, more important victories
might at length attend his valour<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 170. Simeon Dunelm. p. 128.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALFRED lay here concealed, but not unactive, during
a twelvemonth; when the news of a pro&s;perous event
reached his ears, and called him into the field. Hubba,
the Dane, having &s;pread deva&s;tation, &s;ire, and &s;laugh|ter,
over all Wales, had landed in Devon&s;hire from
twenty-three ve&s;&s;els, and laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle of Kin|with,
a place &s;ituated near the mouth of the &s;mall river
Tau<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 10.</NOTE>. Oddune, earl of Devon&s;hire, with his follow|ers,
had taken &s;helter there; and being ill &s;upplied with
provi&s;ions, and even with water, he determined, by &s;ome
vigorous blow, to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to
the barbarous enemy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Flor, Wigorn. 590.</NOTE>. He made a &s;udden &s;ally on the
Danes before &s;un-ri&s;ing; and taking them unprepared,
he put them to rout, pur&s;ued them with great &s;laughter,
killed Hubba him&s;elf, and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the famous
<HI>Reaf$n</HI> or enchanted &s;tandard, in which the Danes put
great confidence<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 84. Abbas Rieval. p. 355. Alured Beverl. P. 105.</NOTE>. It contained the figure of a raven,
which had been inwove by the three &s;i&s;ters of Hinguar
and Hubba, with many magical incantations, and which,
by its different movements, progno&s;ticated, as the Danes
believed, the good or bad &s;ucce&s;s of any enterprise<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN Alfred ob&s;erved this &s;ymptom of &s;ucce&s;sful re|&s;i&s;tance
in his &s;ubjects, he left his retreat; but before he
would a&s;&s;emble them in arms, or urge them to any at|tempt,
which, if unfortunate, might, in their pre&s;ent
de&s;pondency, prove fatal, he re&s;olved, him&s;elf, to in|&s;pect
the &s;ituation of the enemy, and to judge of the
probability of &s;ucce&s;s. For this purpo&s;e, he entered their
<PB N="86" REF="98">
camp under the di&s;gui&s;e of a harper, and pa&s;&s;ed un&s;u&s;|pected
thro' every quarter. He &s;o entertained them with
his mu&s;ic and facetious humours, that he met with a
welcome reception; and was even introduced to Guth|rum,
their prince's tent, where he remained &s;ome days<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4.</NOTE>.
He remarked the &s;upine &s;ecurity of the Danes, their con|tempt
of the Engli&s;h, their negligence in foraging and
plundering, and their di&s;&s;olute wa&s;ting of what they
gained by rapine and violence. Encouraged by the&s;e
favourable appearances, he &s;ecretly &s;ent out his emi&s;&s;a|ries
to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his &s;ubjects, and &s;um|moned
them to a rendezvous, along with their warlike
followers, at Brixton, on the borders of Selwood fore&s;t<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 85.</NOTE>.
The Engli&s;h, who had hoped to put an end to their ca|lamities
by &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, now found the in&s;olence
and rapine of the conqueror more intolerable than all
their pa&s;t fatigues and dangers; and at the appointed
day, they joyfully re&s;orted to their prince. On his ap|pearance
before them, they received him with &s;houts of
applau&s;e<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er, p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 85. Simeon Dunelm. p. 128. Alured Beverl. p. 105. Abbas Rieval. p. 354.</NOTE>; and could not &s;atiate their eyes with the &s;ight
of this beloved monarch, whom they had long regarded
as dead, and who now, with voice and looks expre&s;|&s;ing
his confidence of &s;ucce&s;s, called them to liberty and
vengeance. He in&s;tantly conducted them to Edding|ton,
where the Danes were encamped; and taking ad|vantage
of his previous knowledge of the place, he di|rected
his attack again&s;t the mo&s;t unguarded quarter of the enemy.
The Danes, &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee an army of Eng|li&s;h,
whom they con&s;idered as totally &s;ubdued, and &s;till
more a&s;toni&s;hed to hear Alfred was at their head, made
but a faint re&s;i&s;tance, notwith&s;tanding their &s;uperiority

prince, was be&s;ieged by Alfred in a fortified place, to
which they fled; but being reduced to extremity by want

victor, and offered to &s;ubmit on any conditions<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er, p. 10. Chron. Sax. p. 85. Alured Beverl. p. 105.</NOTE> The
King, no le&s;s generous than brave, gave them their
lives; and even formed a &s;cheme for converting them,
from mortal enemies, into faithful &s;ubjects and confe|derates.
He knew, that the kingdoms of Ea&s;t-Anglia
and Northumberland were left totally de&s;olate by the
frequent inroads of the Danes; and he now purpo&s;ed to
re-people them by &s;ettling there Guthrum and his fol|lowers.
He hoped that the new planters would at la&s;t
betake them&s;elves to indu&s;try, when, by rea&s;on of his
re&s;i&s;tance, and the exhau&s;ted condition of the country,
they could no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t by plunder; and that they
might &s;erve him as a rampart again&s;t any future incur|&s;ions
of their countrymen. But before he ratified the&s;e
mild conditions with the Danes, he required, that they
&s;hould give him one pledge of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and of
their inclination to coale&s;ce with the Engli&s;h, by de|claring
their conversion to Chri&s;tianity<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 85.</NOTE>. Guthrum and
his army had no aver&s;ion to this propo&s;al; and, without
much in&s;truction, or argument, or conference, they were

<P>THE King employed this interval of tranquillity in
re&s;toring order to the &s;tate, which had been &s;haken by &s;o
many violent convul&s;ions, in e&s;tabli&s;hing civil and mili|tary
institutions, in compo&s;ing the minds of men to in
du&s;try and ju&s;tice, and in providing again&s;t the return of
like calamities. He was, more properly than his grand|father
Egbert, the &s;ole monarch of the Engli&s;h, (for &s;o
the Saxons were now univer&s;ally called) becau&s;e the
kingdom of Mercia was at la&s;t incorporated in his &s;tate,
and was governed by Ethelbert, his brother-in-law, who
bore the title of earl: And tho' the Danes, who peo|pled
Ea&s;t-Anglia and Northumberland, were, for &s;ome
$word$, ruled immediately by their own princes, they all
acknowledged a &s;ubordination to Alfred, and &s;ubmitted
to his &s;uperior authority. As equality among &s;ubjects is
the great &s;ource of concord, Alfred gave the &s;ame laws
to the Danes and Engli&s;h, and put them entirely on the
&s;ame footing in the admini&s;tration both of civil and cri|minal
ju&s;tice. The fine for the murder of a Dane was
the &s;ame with that for the murder of an Englishman; the great &s;ymbol of equality in tho&s;e ages.</P>

<P>BUT Alfred, &s;en&s;ible that the proper method of op|po&s;ing
an enemy, who made incur&s;ions by &s;ea, was to
meet them on their own element, took care to provide
him&s;elf with a naval power<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 9. M. We&s;t. p. 179.</NOTE>, which, tho' the mo&s;t na|tural

in the practice, as well of &s;ailing, as of naval ac|tion.
He di&s;tributed his armed ve&s;&s;els in proper &s;tations
around the i&s;land, and was &s;ure to meet the Dani&s;h

Danes might &s;uddenly, by &s;urprize, di&s;embark on the

and the&s;e re&s;tle&s;s tribes being no longer re|&s;trained

The Engli&s;h army, left in London, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
a body of the citizens, attacked the enemy's entrench|ments

gave them hopes of booty, but were not &s;o ea&s;ily en|gaged
to relinqui&s;h their enterprize, or &s;ubmit to return
baffled, and without plunder, into their native country.
Great numbers of them, after Ha&s;tings's departure, &s;eiz|ed
and fortified Shobury at the mouth of the Thames;
and having left a garri&s;on there, they coa&s;ted along the
river, till they came to Boddington in the county of Glo|ce&s;ter;
where, being reinforced by &s;ome Wel&s;h, they

threw up entrenchments, and prepared for their defence.
The King here &s;urrounded them with the whole force of
his dominions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 94.</NOTE>; and as he had now a certain pro&s;pect of
victory, he re&s;olved to tru&s;t nothing to chance, but ra|ther
to ma&s;ter his enemies by famine than a&s;&s;ault. They
were reduced to &s;uch extremities, that, having eat their
own hor&s;es, and having many of them peri&s;hed with
hunger<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 94. M. We&s;t. p. 179. Flor. Wigorn. p. 596.</NOTE>, they made a de&s;perate &s;ally upon the Engli&s;h;
and tho' the greater number fell in the action, a con|&s;iderable
body made their e&s;cape<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 95.</NOTE>. The&s;e roved about
for &s;ome time in England, &s;till pur&s;ued by the vigilance
of Alfred; they attacked Leice&s;ter with &s;ucce&s;s, defend|ed
them&s;elves in Hartford, and then fled to Quatford;
where they were finally broken and &s;ubdued. The &s;mall
remains of them either di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves among their
countrymen in Northumberland and Ea&s;t-Anglia<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 97.</NOTE>, or
had recour&s;e again to the &s;ea, where they exerci&s;ed py|racy,
under the command of Sigefert, a Northumbrian.
This free-booter, well acquainted with Alfred's naval pre|parations,
had framed ve&s;&s;els of a new con&s;truction,
higher, and longer, and &s;wifter, than tho&s;e of the Eng|li&s;h:
But the King &s;oon &s;howed him his &s;uperior &s;kill,

than tho&s;e of the Northumbrians<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 98. H. Hunt. lib. 5. Alur. Beverl. p. 107.</NOTE>; and falling upon
them, while they were exerci&s;ing their ravages in the

the pri&s;oners at Winche&s;ter, he hanged them as pyrates,

for the future &s;ecurity of the government. The
Ea&s;t-Anglian and Northumbrian Danes, on the fir&s;t ap|pearance
of Alfred upon their frontiers, made anew the
mo&s;t humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to him; and he thought it pru|dent
to take them under his immediate government,
without e&s;tabli&s;hing over them a viceroy of their own
nation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 598.</NOTE>. The Wel&s;h al&s;o acknowledged his authority;
and this great prince had now, by prudence and ju&s;tice
and valour, e&s;tabli&s;hed his &s;overeignty over all the &s;ou|thern
parts of the i&s;land, from the Engli&s;h channel to
the frontiers of Scotland: When he died, in the vigour
of his age and the full &s;trength of his faculties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">901.</NOTE> after a
glorious reign of twenty-nine years and a half<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 21. Chron. Sax. p. 99.</NOTE>; in
which he de&s;ervedly attained the appellation of Alfred
the Great, and the title of Founder of the Engli&s;h mo|narchy.</P>
<P>THE merit of this prince, both in private and public
life, may with advantage be &s;et in oppo&s;ition to that
of any monarch or citizen, which the annals of any age
or any nation, can pre&s;ent to us. He &s;eems indeed to
be the complete model of that perfect character, which,
under the denomination of a &s;age or wi&s;e man, the phi|lo&s;ophers
have been fond of delineating, rather as a fic|tion
of their imagination, than in hopes of ever &s;eeing
it reduced to practice: So happily were all his virtues
tempered together; &s;o ju&s;tly were they blended; and &s;o
powerfully did each prevent the other from exceeding its
proper bounds! He knew how to conciliate the mo&s;t
enterprizing &s;pirit with the coole&s;t moderation; the mo&s;t
ob&s;tinate per&s;everance with the ea&s;ie&s;t flexibility; the
mo&s;t &s;evere ju&s;tice with the greate&s;t lenity; the greate&s;t
vigour in command with the greate&s;t affability of
de|portment<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 13.</NOTE>; the highe&s;t capacity and inclination for &s;ci|ence
<PB N="95" REF="107">
with the mo&s;t &s;hining talents for action. His civil
and his military virtues are almo&s;t equally the objects of
our admiration; excepting only, that the former, being
more rare among princes, as well as more u&s;eful, &s;eem
chiefly to challenge our applau&s;e. Nature al&s;o, as if de|&s;irous,
that &s;o bright a production of her &s;kill &s;hould be
&s;et in the faire&s;t light, had be&s;towed on him all bodily
accompli&s;hments, vigour of limbs, dignity of &s;hape and
air, and a plea&s;ant, engaging and open countenance<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 5.</NOTE>.
Fortune alone, by throwing him into that barbarous
age, deprived him of hi&s;torians worthy to tran&s;mit his
fame to po&s;terity; and we wi&s;h to &s;ee him delineated
in more lively colours, and with more particular &s;trokes,
that we may at lea&s;t perceive &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;mall &s;pecks
and blemi&s;hes, from which, as a man, it is impo&s;&s;ible
he could be entirely exempted.</P>
<P>BUT we &s;hould give but an imperfect idea of Alfred's
merit, were we to confine our narration to his military
exploits, and were not more particular in our account of
his in&s;titutions for the execution of ju&s;tice, and of his
zeal for the encouragement of arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>AFTER Alfred had &s;ubdued and &s;ettled or expelled
the Danes, he found the kingdom in the mo&s;t wretched
condition; lying in de&s;olation from the ravages of tho&s;e
barbarians, and thrown into di&s;orders, which were cal|culated
to perpetuate its mi&s;ery. Tho' the great armies
of the Danes were broke, the country was full of &s;trag|gling
troops of that nation, who, being accu&s;tomed to
live by plunder, were become incapable of indu&s;try, and
who, from the natural ferocity of their manners, indulg|ed
them&s;elves in the commi&s;&s;ion of violence, even be|yond
what was requi&s;ite to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities. The
Engli&s;h them&s;elves, reduced to the mo&s;t extreme indi|gence
by the&s;e continued depredations, had &s;haken off
<PB N="96" REF="108">
all bands of government; and tho&s;e who had been plun|dered
to-day, betook them&s;elves to a like di&s;orderly life,
and from de&s;pair joined next day the robbers in pillaging
and ruining their fellow-citizens<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. M. We&s;t. p. 177.</NOTE> The&s;e were the
evils, for which it was nece&s;&s;ary that the vigilance and
activity of Alfred &s;hould provide a remedy.</P>
<P>THAT he might render the execution of ju&s;tice &s;trict
and regular, he divided all England into counties; the&s;e
counties he &s;ubdivided into hundreds; and the hundreds
into tythings<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4. Ingulf. p. 28. Brompton, p. 818. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 22.</NOTE>. Every hou&s;eholder was an&s;werable for
the behaviour of his family, and his &s;laves, and even of
his gue&s;ts, if they lived above three days in his hou&s;e<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Leg. St. Edw. cap. 27.</NOTE>.
Ten neighbouring hou&s;eholders were formed into one
corporation, who, under the name of a tything, decen|nary,
or fribourg, were an&s;werable for each other's con|duct,
and over whom one per&s;on, called a tything-man,
headbourg, or bor&s;holder, was appointed to pre&s;ide.
Every man was puni&s;hed as an outlaw, who did not re|gi&s;ter
him&s;elf in &s;ome tything<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 28.</NOTE>: and no man could
change his habitation, without a warrant and certificate
from the bor&s;holder of the tything, to which he formerly
belonged.</P>
<P>WHEN any per&s;on in any tything or decennary was
guilty of a crime, the bor&s;holder was &s;ummoned to an|&s;wer
for him; and if he was not willing to be &s;urety for
his appearance and his clearing him&s;elf, the criminal
was committed to pri&s;on, and there detained till his trial.
If he fled, either before or after finding &s;ureties, the
bor&s;holder and decennary became liable to enquiry, and
were expo&s;ed to the penalties of law<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. lib. 2. cap. 4.</NOTE>. Thirty-one days
were allowed them for producing the criminal; and if
that time elap&s;ed without their being able to find him,
<PB N="97" REF="109">
the bor&s;holder, with two other members of the decenna|ry,
was obliged to appear, and together with three chief
members of the three neighbouring decennaries (making
twelve in all) to &s;wear that his decennary was free from
all privity both of the crime committed, and of the e&s;cape
of the criminal. If the bor&s;holder could not find &s;uch a
number to an&s;wer for their innocence, the decennary
was compelled by fine to make &s;atisfaction to the King,
according to the degree of the crime<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Leges St. Edw. cap. 20. apud Wilkins, p. 202.</NOTE>. By this in&s;titu|tion
every man was obliged from his own intere&s;t to keep
a watchful eye over the conduct of his neighbours; and
was in a manner &s;urety for the behaviour of tho&s;e who
were placed under the divi&s;ion, to which he belonged:
Whence the&s;e decennaries received the name of frank|pledges.</P>
<P>SUCH a regular di&s;tribution of the people, and &s;uch a
&s;trict con&s;inement in their habitation, may not be nece&s;|&s;ary
in times, when men are more enured to obedience
and ju&s;tice, and might perhaps be regarded as de&s;tructive
of liberty and commerce in a poli&s;hed &s;tate; but were
well calculated to reduce the&s;e fierce and licentious peo|ple
under the &s;alutary re&s;traint of law and government.
But Alfred took care to temper the&s;e rigours by other in|&s;titutions favourable to the freedom and &s;ecurity of the
citizens; and nothing could be more popular and liberal
than his plan for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. The bor&s;|holder
&s;ummoned together his whole decennary to a&s;&s;i&s;t
him in deciding any le&s;&s;er differences, which occurred
among the members of this &s;mall community. In affairs
of greater moment, in appeals from the decennary, or in
controver&s;ies ari&s;ing between members of different decen|naries,
the cau&s;e was brought before the hundred, which
con&s;i&s;ted of ten decennaries, or a hundred families of free-men,
and which was regularly a&s;&s;embled once in four
<PB N="98" REF="110">
weeks, for the deciding of cau&s;es<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Leg Edw. cap. 2.</NOTE>. Their method of
deci&s;ion de&s;erves to be noted; as being the origin of ju|ries;
an in&s;titution, admirable in it&s;elf, and the be&s;t cal|culated
for the pre&s;ervation of liberty and the admini&s;tra|tion
of ju&s;tice, that ever was devi&s;ed by the wit of man.
Twelve freeholders were cho&s;en; who having &s;worn,
together with the hundreder or pre&s;iding magi&s;trate of
that divi&s;ion, to admini&s;ter impartial ju&s;tice<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Faedus Alfred, and Gothurn, apud Wilkins. cap. 3. p. 47. Leg. Ethel&s;tani, cap. 2. apud Wilkins, p. 58. LL. Ethelr. &sect; 4. Wilkins, p. 117.</NOTE>, proceeded
to the examination of that cau&s;e, which was &s;ubmitted to
their juri&s;diction. And be&s;ide the&s;e monthly meetings of
the hundred, there was an annual meeting, appointed
for a more general in&s;pection of the police of the di&s;trict;
the enquiry into crimes, the correction of abu&s;es in ma|gi&s;trates,
and the obliging every per&s;on to &s;hew the de|cennary
in which he was regi&s;tered. The people, in
imitation of their ance&s;tors, the antient Germans, a&s;&s;em|bled
there in arms; whence a hundred was &s;ometimes
called a wapentake, and its court &s;erved both for the
&s;upport of military di&s;cipline, and for the admini&s;tration
of civil ju&s;tice<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Spellman in voce Wapentake.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next &s;uperior court to that of the hundred was
the county-court, which met twice a year after Michael|mas
and Ea&s;ter, and con&s;i&s;ted of all the freeholders of the
county, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an equal vote in the deci&s;ion of
cau&s;es. The bi&s;hop pre&s;ided in this court, together with
the alderman; and the proper object of the court was the
receiving appeals from the hundreds and decennaries, and
the deciding &s;uch controver&s;ies as aro&s;e between men of
different hundreds. Formerly, the alderman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
both the civil and military authority; but Alfred, &s;en|&s;ible
that this coalition of powers rendered the nobility
<PB N="99" REF="111">
dangerous and independant, appointed al&s;o a &s;heriff in
each county; who enjoyed a co-ordinate authority with
the former in the judicial function<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ingulf. p. 870.</NOTE>. His office al&s;o em|powered
him to guard the rights of the crown in the
county; and to levy the fines impo&s;ed; which in that
age formed no contemptible part of the public revenue.</P>
<P>THERE lay an appeal, in default of ju&s;tice, from all
the&s;e courts to the King him&s;elf in council; and as the
people, &s;en&s;ible of the equity and great talents of Alfred,
placed their chief confidence in him, he was &s;oon over|whelmed
with appeals from all parts of England. He
was indefatigable in the di&s;patch of the&s;e cau&s;es<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 20.</NOTE>; but
finding that his time mu&s;t be entirely engro&s;&s;ed by this
branch of duty, he re&s;olved to obviate the inconvenience,
by correcting the ignorance or corruption of the inferior
magi&s;trates, from which it aro&s;e<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 18. 21. Flor. Wigorn. p. 594. Abbas Rieval, p. 355.</NOTE>. He took care to
have his nobility in&s;tructed in letters and the laws<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wigorn. p. 594. Brompton, p. 814.</NOTE>: He
cho&s;e the earls and &s;heriffs from among the men mo&s;t ce|lebrated
for probity and knowledge: He puni&s;hed &s;evere|ly
all malver&s;ation in office<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Le Miroir de Ju&s;tice, chap. 2.</NOTE>: And he removed all the
earls, whom he found unequal to the tru&s;t<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 20.</NOTE>; allowing
only &s;ome of the mo&s;t elderly to &s;erve by a depute, till
their death &s;hould make room for more worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>THE better to guide the magi&s;trates in the admini&s;tra|tion
of ju&s;tice, Alfred framed a body of laws; which,
tho' now lo&s;t, &s;erved long as the ba&s;is of Engli&s;h juri&s;|prudence,
and is generally e&s;teemed the origin of what is
denominated the COMMON LAW. He appointed regular
meetings of the &s;tates of England twice a year in Lon|don<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Le Miroir de Ju&s;tice.</NOTE>; a city which he him&s;elf had repaired and beauti|fied
<PB N="100" REF="112">
and which he thus rendered the capital of the king|dom.
The &s;imilarity of many of the&s;e in&s;titutions to the
cu&s;toms of the antient Germans, to the practice of the
other northern conquerors, and to the Saxon laws during
the Heptarchy, prevents us from regarding Alfred as the
&s;ole author of this plan of government; and leads us ra|ther
to think, that, like a wi&s;e man, he contented him|&s;elf
with reforming, extending, and executing the in&s;ti|tutions,
which he found previou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed. But on
the whole, &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s attended his legi&s;lation, that eve|ry
thing bore &s;uddenly a new face in England: Rob|beries
and iniquities of all kinds were repre&s;&s;ed by the pu|ni&s;hment
or reformation of the criminals<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 27.</NOTE>: And &s;o exact
was the general police, that Alfred, it is &s;aid, hung up,
by way of bravado, golden bracelets near the high|ways;
and no man dared to touch them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 4. M. We&s;t. p. 177. Brompton, p. 818.</NOTE>. Yet amid&s;t
the&s;e rigours of ju&s;tice, this great prince pre&s;erved the
mo&s;t &s;acred regard to the liberty of his people; and it is a
memorable &s;entiment pre&s;erved in his will, that it was
ju&s;t the Engli&s;h &s;hould for ever remain as free as their
own thoughts<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As good morals and knowledge are almo&s;t in&s;eparable,
in every age, tho' not in every individual; the care of
Alfred for the encouragement of learning among his &s;ub|jects
was another u&s;eful branch of his legi&s;lation, and
tended to reform the Engli&s;h from their former di&s;&s;olute
and barbarous manners: But the King was guided in this
pur&s;uit le&s;s by political views, than by his natural bent
and propen&s;ity towards letters. When he came to the
throne, he found the Engli&s;h &s;unk into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t igno|rance
and barbari&s;m, proceeding from the continued di&s;|orders
in the government, and from the ravages of the Danes: The mona&s;teries were de&s;troyed, the monks
<PB N="101" REF="113">
butchered or di&s;per&s;ed, their libraries burnt; and thus
the only &s;eats of erudition in tho&s;e ages were totally &s;ub|verted<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 18.</NOTE>. Alfred him&s;elf complains, that on his acce&s;|&s;ion
he knew not one per&s;on, &s;outh of the Thames, who
could &s;o much as interpret the Latin &s;ervice; and very
few in the northern parts, who had reached even that
pitch of erudition<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 25.</NOTE>. But this prince invited over the
mo&s;t celebrated &s;cholars from all parts of Europe<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 167. Chron. Abb. de St. Petri de Burgo, p. 21.</NOTE>;
he e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;chools every where for the in&s;truction of
his people; he founded, or at lea&s;t repaired<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;er. p. 16. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 207.</NOTE> the univer|&s;ity
of Oxford, and endowed it with many privileges, re|venues
and immunities; he enjoined by law all freehold|ers
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two hydes<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">A hyde contained land &s;ufficient to employ one plough. See H. Hunting. lib. 6. in A. D. 1008. Annal Waverl. in A. D. 1083. Gerva&s;e of Tilbury &s;ays it commonly contained about 100 acres.</NOTE> of land or more to &s;end their

he had the plea&s;ure, before his death, to &s;ee a great

for the encouragement of learning, was his own
example, and the con&s;tant a&s;&s;iduity, with which, not|with&s;tanding
the multitude and urgency of his affairs, he
employed him&s;elf in the pur&s;uits of knowledge. He u&s;ually

thus to lead the way to his people in the pur&s;uits

<P>MEANWHILE, this prince was not negligent in en|couraging
the vulgar and mechanical arts, which have a
more &s;en&s;ible, tho' not a clo&s;er connexion with the inte|re&s;ts

<P>THIS prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">901.</NOTE> who equalled his father in military ta|lents,
tho' inferior to him in knowledge and erudi|tion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 5. Hoveden, p. 421.</NOTE>, found immediately, on his acce&s;&s;ion, a &s;pecimen
of that turbulent life, which attended all princes, and
even all individuals, in an age when men, le&s;s re&s;trained
by ju&s;tice or law, and le&s;s occupied by indu&s;try, had no
other aliment for their inquietude, but wars, in&s;ur|rections,
convul&s;ions, rapine, and depredation. Ethel|wald,

the throne<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 99, 100.</NOTE>; and arming his partizans, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

&s;eize the fir&s;t pretence or opportunity of rebellion. The
event did not di&s;appoint his expectations: The North|umbrians
declared for him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 100. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 352.</NOTE>; and Ethelwald, having thus

were &s;eated in the heart of Mercia, began to put them|&s;elves
in motion; and the Engli&s;h found that they were
again menaced with tho&s;e convul&s;ions, from which the
valour and policy of Alfred had &s;o lately redeemed them.
The rebels, headed by Ethelwald, made an incur&s;ion in|to

having exerci&s;ed their ravages in the&s;e places, they re|tired
with their booty, before the King, who had a&s;&s;em|bled
his army, was able to approach them. Edward,
however, who was determined that his preparations
&s;hould not be fruitle&s;s, conducted his forces into Ea&s;t-Anglia,
and retaliated the injuries which the inhabitants
had committed, by &s;preading the like deva&s;tation among
them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 352. Brompton, p. 832.</NOTE>. Being &s;atiated with revenge, and loaded with
booty, he gave orders to retire: But the authority of
the&s;e antient Kings, which was feeble in peace, was not
much better obeyed in the field; and the Kenti&s;h men,
greedy of more &s;poil, ventured, contrary to repeated or|ders,
to &s;tay behind him, and to take up their quarters
in Bury<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 101. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 352.</NOTE>. This di&s;obedience proved in the i&s;&s;ue fortu|nate
to Edward. The Danes a&s;&s;aulted the Kenti&s;h
men; but met with &s;o &s;tout a re&s;i&s;tance, that, tho'
they gained the field of battle, they bought that advan|tage
by the lo&s;s of their brave&s;t leaders, and among the
re&s;t, by that of Ethelwald, who peri&s;hed in the action<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 101. Brompton, p. 832.</NOTE>.

but the &s;ubjection of the Northumbrians, who, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed
by the &s;cattered Danes in Mercia, continually infe&s;ted
the bowels of the kingdom. Edward, in order to divert
the force of the&s;e enemies, prepared a fleet to attack

off their coa&s;t, they mu&s;t at lea&s;t remain at home, and
provide for their own defence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 352.</NOTE>. But the Northumbri|ans
were le&s;s anxious to &s;ecure their own property than

Edward's territories with all their forces<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 102. Flor. Wigorn. p. 599.</NOTE>. The

&s;ubdued the Ea&s;t-Angles, and forced them to &s;wear alle|giance

<P>THE &s;tain in this prince's birth was not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">925.</NOTE> in tho&s;e
times, deemed &s;o con&s;iderable as to exclude him
from the throne; and Athel&s;tan, being of an age, as well
as of a capacity, &s;itted for government, obtained the pre|ference
to Edward's younger children, who, tho' legiti|mate,
were of too tender years to rule a nation &s;o much
expo&s;ed both to foreign inva&s;ion and to dome&s;tic convul&s;ions.
Some di&s;contents, however, prevailed on his ac|ce&s;&s;ion;
and Alfred, a nobleman of con&s;iderable power,
was thence encouraged to enter into a con&s;piracy again&s;t
him. This event is related by hi&s;torians with circum|&s;tances,
which the reader, according to the degree of
credit he is di&s;po&s;ed to give them, may impute either to
the invention of monks, who forged them, or to their ar|tifice,
who found means to make them real. Alfred, it
is &s;aid, being &s;eized upon &s;trong &s;u&s;picions, but without
any certain proof, firmly denied the con&s;piracy imputed
to him; and in order to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, he offered to
&s;wear to his innocence before the Pope, who&s;e per&s;on, it
was &s;uppo&s;ed, contained &s;uch &s;uperior &s;anctity, that no
one could pre&s;ume to give a fal&s;e oath in his pre|&s;ence,
and yet hope to e&s;cape the immediate vengeance
of heaven. The King accepted of the condition, and
Alfred was conducted to Rome; where, either con&s;cious
of his innocence, or neglecting the &s;uper&s;tition, to which
he appealed, he ventured to make the oath required of
him, before John, who then filled the papal chair. But
no &s;ooner had he pronounced the fatal words, than he
fell into convul&s;ions, of which in three days after he ex|pired.
The King, as if the guilt of the con&s;pirator were
now fully a&s;certained, confi&s;cated his e&s;tate, and made a

pre&s;ent of it to the mona&s;tery of Malme&s;bury<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 6. Spell. Conc. p. 407.</NOTE>; &s;e$ure

<P>THE dominion of Athel&s;tan was no &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed
over his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, than he endeavoured to give &s;e|curity
to the government, by providing again&s;t the in&s;ur|rections
of the Danes, which had created &s;o much di|&s;turbance
to his predece&s;&s;ors. He marched into Nor|thumberland;
and finding, that the inhabitants bore
with impatience the Engli&s;h yoke, he thought it prudent
to give Sithric, a Dani&s;h nobleman, the title of King,
and to attach him to his intere&s;ts, by marrying him to his
&s;i&s;ter, Editha<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Alured Beverl. p. 109. W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 6. Hoveden, p. 422.</NOTE>. But this policy proved by accident the
&s;ource of very dangerous con&s;equences. Sithric died in a
twelvemonth after; and his two &s;ons by a former mar|riage,
Anlaf and Godfrid, founding preten&s;ions on their
father's elevation, a&s;&s;umed the &s;overeignty, without wait|ing
for Athel&s;tan's con&s;ent. They were &s;oon expelled
by the power of that monarch; and the former took &s;hel|ter
in Ireland, as the latter did in Scotland<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 6.</NOTE>; where he
received, during &s;ome time, protection from Con&s;tantine,
who then enjoyed the crown of that kingdom. The
Scotti&s;h prince, however, continually &s;olicited, and even
menaced, by Athel&s;tan, at la&s;t promi&s;ed to deliver up his
gue&s;t; but &s;ecretly dete&s;ting this treachery, he gave God|frid
warning to make his e&s;cape<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and that fugitive, af|ter
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting by pyracy $or &s;ome years, freed the King,
by his death, from any farther anxiety. Athel&s;tan, re|&s;enting
Con&s;tantine's behaviour, entered Scotland with a
great army; and ravaging the country with impunity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 111. Hoveden, p. 42. H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 354.</NOTE>,
he reduced the Scots to &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, that their King was

content to pre&s;erve his crown, by making the mo&s;t hum|ble
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the enemy. The Engli&s;h hi&s;torians
a&s;&s;ert<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 422,</NOTE> that Con&s;tantine did homage to Athel&s;tan for
his whole kingdom; and they add, that the latter
prince, being urged by his courtiers to pu&s;h the pre&s;ent

that it was more glorious to confer than conquer

<P>CONSTANTINE, whether he owed the retaining his
crown to the moderation of Athel&s;tan, who was unwil|ling

policy of that monarch, who e&s;teemed the humiliation of
an enemy a greater acqui&s;ition than the &s;ubjection of a
di&s;contented and mutinous people, thought the behaviour
of the Engli&s;h more an object of re&s;entment than of gra|titude.
He entered into a confederacy with Anlaf, who
had collected a great body of Dani&s;h pyrates, whom he
found hovering in the Iri&s;h &s;eas; and with &s;ome Wel&s;h
princes, who were terrified with the growing power of
Athel&s;tan: And all the&s;e allies made by concert an irrup|tion
with a great army into England. Athel&s;tan, collect|ing

and defeated them in a general engage|ment<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 11$, 113. W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 6. Ethel|werd, cap. 5. H. Hunting. lib. 5 p$ 3 $4 O&s;berne, p. 80.

<P>THERE is a circum&s;tance, not unworthy of notice,
which hi&s;torians relate with regard to the tran&s;actions of
this war. Anlaf, on the approach of the Engli&s;h army,
thought, that he could not venture too much to en&s;ure a
fortunate event; and employing the artifice formerly
practi&s;ed by Alfred again&s;t the Danes, he entered the ene|my's
camp in the habit of a min&s;trel. The &s;tratagem was
for the pre&s;ent attended with a like &s;ucce&s;s. He gave
&s;uch &s;atisfaction to the &s;oldiers, who flocked about him,
that they introduced him to the King's tent; and Anlaf,
having played before that prince and his nobles during
their repa&s;t, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a hand&s;ome reward. His
prudence kept him from refu&s;ing the pre&s;ent; but his
pride determined him, on his departure, to bury it, while
he fancied that he was une&s;pied by all the world. But a
&s;oldier in Athel&s;tan's camp, who had formerly &s;erved un|der
Anlaf, had been &s;truck with &s;ome &s;u&s;picion on the
fir&s;t appearance of the min&s;trel; and was engaged by curi|o&s;ity
to ob&s;erve all his motions. He regarded this la&s;t action
as a full proof of Anlaf's di&s;gui&s;e; and he immediately
carried the intelligence to Athel&s;tan, who blamed him for
not &s;ooner giving him information, that he might have
&s;eized his enemy. But the &s;oldier told him, that as he
had formerly &s;worn fealty to Anlaf, he could never have
pardoned him&s;elf the treachery of betraying and ruining
his ancient ma&s;ter; and that Athel&s;tan him&s;elf, after &s;uch
an in&s;tance of his criminal conduct, would have had
equal rea&s;on to doubt of his allegiance. Athel&s;tan, hav|ing
prai&s;ed the genero&s;ity of the &s;oldier's principles, re|flected
on the incident, which he fore&s;aw might be at|tended
<PB N="112" REF="124">
with important con&s;equences. He removed his
&s;tation in the camp; and as a bi&s;hop arrived that even|ing
with a reinforcement of troops, (for the eccle&s;ia&s;tics
were then no le&s;s warlike than the civil magi&s;trates) he
occupied with his train that very place which had been
left vacant by the King's removal. The precaution of
Athel&s;tan was found prudent: For no &s;ooner had dark|ne&s;s
fallen, than Anlaf broke into the camp, and ha&s;ten|ing
directly to the place where he had left the King's
tent, put the bi&s;hop to death, before he had time to pre|pare
for his defence<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 6. Higden, p. 263.</NOTE>.</P>

their e&s;cape with difficulty, leaving the greate&s;t part of
their army on the field of battle. After this &s;ucce&s;s,
Athel&s;tan enjoyed his crown in tranquillity; and he is
regarded as one of the able&s;t and mo&s;t active of tho&s;e an|tient

to have devi&s;ed. That a merchant, who had made two

<P>EDMUND was very young when he came to the crown;
yet his reign was &s;hort, as his death was violent. One
day, as he was &s;olemnizing a fe&s;tival in the county of
Gloce&s;ter, he remarked, that Leolf, a notorious robber,
whom he had &s;entenced to bani&s;hment, had yet the bold|ne&s;s
to enter the hall where he him&s;elf dined, and to &s;it at
table with his attendants. Enraged at this in&s;olence, he
ordered him to leave the room; but on his refu&s;ing to
obey, the King, who&s;e temper, naturally choleric, was
inflamed by this additional in&s;ult; leaped on him him&s;elf,
and &s;eized him by the hair: But the ruffian, pu&s;hed to
extremity, drew his dagger, and gave Edmund an wound,
<PB N="114" REF="126">
of which he immediately expired<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 7. Hoveden, p. 423. Chron, de Mui$|ro&s;e, p. 148.</NOTE> This event happen|ed

were incapable of governing the kingdom; and his bro|ther,
Edred, was promoted to the crown.</P>

<HEAD>EDRED.</HEAD>
<P>THE reign of this prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">946.</NOTE> as that of his predece&s;&s;ors,
was di&s;turbed by the rebellions and incur&s;ions of the
Northumbrian Danes, who, tho' frequently quelled,
were never entirely &s;ubdued, nor had ever paid a &s;in|cere
allegiance to the crown of England. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of a new King &s;eemed to them a favourable opportu|nity
for &s;haking off the yoke; but on Edred's appearance
with an army, they made him their wonted &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions;
and the King having wa&s;ted the country with fire and
&s;word, as a puni&s;hment of their rebellion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 423. Wallingford, p. 541.</NOTE>, obliged them
to renew their oaths of allegiance; and he &s;trait returned
with his forces. The obedience of the Danes la&s;ted no
longer than the pre&s;ent terror. Provoked at the deva&s;ta|tions
of Edred, and even reduced by nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ub&s;i&s;t
on plunder, they broke into a new rebellion, and were
again &s;ubdued<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ethelwerd, cap. 7. Hoveden, p. 423.</NOTE>: But the King, now in&s;tructed by expe|rience,
took better precautions again&s;t their future revolt.
He fixed Engli&s;h garri&s;ons in their mo&s;t con&s;iderable
towns; and placed over them an Engli&s;h governor, who
might watch all their motions, and &s;uppre&s;s their in&s;ur|rections
on the fir&s;t appearance. He obliged al&s;o Mal|colm,
<PB N="115" REF="127">
King of Scotland, to renew his homage for the
lands which he held in England<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Matth. We&s;t. p. 186. Higden, p. 263.</NOTE></P>
<P>EDRED, tho' not unwarlike, nor unfit for active life,
lay under the influence of the lowe&s;t &s;uper&s;tition, and
had blindly delivered over his con&s;cience to the guidance
of Dun&s;tan, commonly called St. Dun&s;tan, abbot of
Gla&s;tenbury<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 7. Brompton, p. 862.</NOTE>, whom he advanced to the highe&s;t offices,
and who covered, under the appearance of &s;anctity, the
mo&s;t violent and mo&s;t In&s;olent ambition. Taking ad|vantage
of the implicit faith repo&s;ed in him by the King,
this churchman imported into England a new prder of
monks, who much changed the &s;tate of eccle&s;ia&s;tical af|fairs,
and excited, on their, fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, the mo&s;t
violent commotions.</P>
<P>FROM the time of the fir&s;t introduction of Chri&s;tiani|ty
among the Saxons, there had been mona&s;teries in
England; and the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments had extremely multi|plied,
by the donations of the princes and nobles; who&s;e
&s;uper&s;tition, derived from their ignorance and precari|ous
life, and encrea&s;ed by remor&s;es for the crimes into
which they were &s;o frequently betrayed, knew no other
expedient $or appeasing the Deity than a profu&s;e libera|lity
towards the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. But the monks had hi|therto
been a &s;pecies of &s;ecular prie&s;ts, who lived in the
convents after the manner of the pre&s;ent canons or pre|bendaries,
and were both intermingled, in &s;ome degree,
with the world, and endeavoured to render them&s;elves
u&s;eful to it. They were employed in the education of
youth<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne in Anglia Sa$ra, tom. 2. p. 92.</NOTE>: They had the di&s;po&s;al of their own time and
indu&s;try: They were not &s;ubjeected to the rigid rules of
an order: They had made no vows of implicit obedience
to their &s;uperiors<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 91.</NOTE>: And they &s;till retained the choice,
<PB N="116" REF="128">
without quitting the convent, either of a married or a
&s;ingle life<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">See Wharton's notes to Anglia Scara, tom. $2. p. 91. Gerva&s;e, p. 1645. Chron. Wint, MS. Apud Spell, Con$, p. 434.</NOTE>. But a mi&s;taken piety had produced in Italy
a nevv &s;pecies of monks, called Benedictines; who, car|rying
farther the plau&s;ible principles of mortification, &s;e|cluded
them&s;elves entirely from the world, renounced
all claim to liberty, and made a merit of the mo&s;t invio|lable
cha&s;tity. The&s;e practices and principles, which
&s;uper&s;tition at fir&s;t engendered, were greedily embraced
and promoted by the policy of the court of Rome. The
Roman pontiff, who was making every day great ad|vances
towards an univer&s;al &s;overeignty over the eccle|&s;ia&s;tics,
perceived, that the celibacy alone of the clergy
could break off entirely their connexion with the civil
power, and depriving them of every other object of am|bition,
engage them to promote, with uncea&s;ing indu&s;|try,
the grandeur of their own order. He was &s;en&s;ible,
that &s;o long as the monks were indulged in marriage,
and were allowed families, they never could be &s;ubjected
to a &s;trict rule, or reduced to that &s;lavery under their
&s;uperiors, which was requi&s;ite to procure to the orders,
i&s;&s;ued from Rome, a ready and zealous obedience. Ce|libacy,
therefore, began to be extolled, as the indi&s;pen&s;ible
duty of prie&s;ts; and the Pope undertook to make
all the clergy throughout the we&s;tern world renounce at
once the privilege of marriage: A fortunate policy, but
at the &s;ame time an undertaking the mo&s;t difficult of
any, &s;ince he had the &s;tronge&s;t propen&s;ities of human na|ture
to encounter, and found, that the &s;ame connexions
with the female &s;ex, which generally encourages devo|tion,
was here unfavourable to the &s;ucce&s;s of his pro|ject.
It is no wonder, therefore, that this ma&s;ter-&s;troke
of art &s;hould have met with violent contradiction, and
that the intere&s;ts of the hierarchy, and the inclinations
<PB N="117" REF="129">
of the prie&s;ts, being now placed in this &s;ingular oppo&s;i|tion,
&s;hould, notwith&s;tanding the continued efforts of
Rome, have retarded the execution of that bold &s;cheme,
during the cour&s;e of near three centuries.</P>
<P>As the bi&s;hops and parochial clergy lived apart with
their families, and were more connected with the world,
the hopes of &s;ucce&s;s with them were fainter, and the
pretence for making them renounce marriage was much
le&s;s plau&s;ible. But the pope, having ca&s;t his eye on the
monks as the ba&s;is of his authority, was determined to
reduce them under &s;trict rules of obedience, to procure
them the credit of &s;anctity by an appearance of the mo&s;t
rigid mortifications, and to break off all their other
connections which might interfere with his &s;piritual po|licy.
Under pretence, therefore, of reforming abu&s;es,
which were, in &s;ome degree, unavoidable in the antient
e&s;tabli&s;hments, he had already &s;pread over the &s;outhern
countries of Europe the &s;trict rules of the mona&s;tic life,
and began to form attempts towards a like innovation in England.
The favourable opportunity offered it&s;elf (and
it was greedily &s;eized) ari&s;ing from the weak &s;uper&s;tition of Edred, and the violent impetuous character of Dun|&s;tan.</P>
<P>DUNSTAN was born of noble parents in the we&s;t of
England; and being educated under his uncle, Aldhelm,
then Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, had betaken him&s;elf to
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical life, and had acquired &s;ome character in
the court of Edmund. He was, however, defamed to
that prince as a man of licentious manners<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 95. Math. We&s;t. p. 187.</NOTE>; and find|ing
his fortune bla&s;ted by the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, his ardent am|bition
prompted him to repair his indi&s;cretions by run|ning
into an oppo&s;ite extreme. He &s;ecluded him&s;elf en|tirely
from the world; he framed a cell &s;o &s;mall that he
could neither &s;tand erect in it, nor &s;tretch out his limbs
<PB N="118" REF="130">
during his repo&s;e; and he here employed him&s;elf perpe|tually
either in devotion or in manual labour<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 96.</NOTE>. It is
probable, that his brain became gradually crazed by the&s;e
&s;olitary occupations, and that he framed chimeras, which,
being believed by him&s;elf and his &s;tupid votaries, pro|cured
him the general character of &s;anctity among the
people. He fancied, that the devil, among the frequent
vi&s;its, which he paid him, was one day more earne&s;t
than u&s;ual in his temptations; till Dun&s;tan, provoked at
his importunity, &s;eized him by the no&s;e with a pair of
red hot pincers, as he put his head into the cell; and he
held him there, till that malignant &s;pirit made the whole neighbourhood refound with his bellowings. This not|able
exploit was &s;eriou&s;ly credited and extolled by the
public; it is tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity by one who, con|&s;idering
his age, may pa&s;s for a writer of &s;ome elegance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 97.</NOTE>;
and it in&s;ured to Dun&s;tan, a reputation, which no real
piety, much le&s;s virtue, could, even in the mo&s;t en|lightened
period, have ever been able to procure him
with the people.</P>
<P>SUPPORTED by the character, obtained in his retreat,
Dun&s;tan appeared again at court; and gained &s;uch an
a&s;cendant over Edred, who had &s;ucceeded to the crown,
as made him, not only the director of his con&s;cience,
but his coun&s;ellor in the mo&s;t momentous affairs of go|vernment.
He was placed at the head of the trea&s;ury<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 102. Wallingford, p. 541.</NOTE>,
and being thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both of power at court, and of
credit with the populace, he was enabled to attempt
with &s;ucce&s;s the mo&s;t arduous undertakings. Finding,
that his advancement had been owing to the opinion of
his au&s;terity, he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a partizan of the rigid
mona&s;tic rules; and after introducing that reformation
<PB N="119" REF="131">
into the convents of Gla&s;tenbury and Abingdon, he en|deavoured
to render it univer&s;al in the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE minds of men were already well prepared for
this innovation. The prai&s;es of an inviolable cha&s;tity
had been carried to the highe&s;t extravagance by &s;ome
of the fir&s;t preachers of chri&s;tianity among the Saxons:
The plea&s;ures of love had been repre&s;ented as incompa|tible
with chri&s;tian perfection: And a total ab&s;tinence
from all commerce with the &s;ex was deemed &s;uch a me|ritorious
pennance, as was &s;ufficient to atone for the greate&s;t enormities. The con&s;equence &s;eemed natural,
that tho&s;e at lea&s;t who officiated at the altar &s;hould be
clear of this pollution; and when the doctrine of tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation,
which was now creeping in, was once
fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, the reverence to the real body of Chri&s;t
in the euchari&s;t, be&s;towed on this argument an addi|tional
force and influence. The monks knew how to
avail them&s;elves of all the&s;e popular topics, and to &s;et
off their own character to the be&s;t advantage. They
affected the greate&s;t au&s;terity of life and manners: They
indulged them&s;elves in the highe&s;t &s;trains of devotion:
They inveighed bitterly again&s;t the vices and pretended
luxury of the age: They were particularly vehement
again&s;t the di&s;&s;olute lives of the &s;ecular clergy, their ri|vals:
Every particular in&s;tance of libertini&s;m in that or|der
was repre&s;ented as a general corruption: And where
other topics of defamation were wanting, their marriage
became a &s;ure object of invective, and their wives re|ceived
the name of <HI>concubines,</HI> or other more opprobrious
appellation. The &s;ecular clergy, on the other hand,
who were numerous and rich, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
dignities, defended them&s;elves with vigour, and
endeavoured to retaliate upon their adver&s;aries. The
people were thrown into agitation; and few in&s;tances
<PB N="120" REF="132">
occur of more violent diffentions, excited by the mo&s;t
material differences in religion; or rather by the mo&s;t
frivolous: Since it is a general remark, that the more
affinity there is between theological parties, the greater
commonly is their animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s of the monks, which was become con|&s;iderable,
was &s;omewhat retarded by the death of Ed|red,
their partizan, who expired after a reign of nine
years<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chorn. Sax. p. 115.</NOTE>. He left children; but as they were infants, his
nephew, Edwy, &s;on to Edmund, was placed on the
throne.</P>

<HEAD>EDWY.</HEAD>
<P>EDWY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">955.</NOTE> at the time of his acce&s;&s;ion, was not above &s;ix|teen
or &s;eventeen years of age, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the
mo&s;t amiable figure, and even endowed, according to
authentic accounts, with the mo&s;t promi&s;ing virtues<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">H. Hunting. lib. 5. p. 356.</NOTE>. He would have been the favourite of his people, had he
not unhappily, on the commencement of his reign, been
engaged in a controver&s;y with the monks, who&s;e rage
neither the graces of the body nor virtues of the mind
could mitigate, and who have pur&s;ued his memory with
the &s;ame unrelenting vengeance, which they exerci&s;ed
again&s;t his per&s;on and dignity during his &s;hort and un|fortunate
reign. There was a beautiful prince&s;s of the
royal blood, called Elgiva, who had made impre&s;&s;ion on
the tender heart of Edwy; and as he was of an age,
when the force of the pa&s;&s;ions begins fir&s;t to be felt, he
had ventured, contrary to the advice of his grave&s;t coun|&s;ellors,
and the remon&s;trances of the more dignified ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics
<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 7.</NOTE>, to e&s;pou&s;e her; tho' &s;he was within the de|grees
of affinity, prohibited by the canon-law<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. As the
<PB N="121" REF="133">
au&s;terity, affected by the monks, made them particularly
violent on this occa&s;ion, Edwy entertained a &s;trong pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
again&s;t them; and &s;eemed on that account de|termined
not to &s;econd their project, of expelling the &s;e|culars
from all the convents, and of acquiring to them|&s;elves
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e rich e&s;tabli&s;hments. The war
was therefore declared between the King and the monks;
and the former &s;oon found rea&s;on to repent him of his
provoking &s;uch dangerous enemies. On the day of his
coronation, his nobility were a&s;&s;embled in a great hall,
and were indulging them&s;elves in that riot and di&s;order,
which, from the example of their German ance&s;tors,
had become habitual to the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Wallingford, p. 542.</NOTE>; when Edwy, at|tracted
by &s;ofter plea&s;ures, retired into the Queen's
apartments, and in that privacy, gave reins to his fond|ne&s;s
towards his wife, which was only moderately check|ed
by the pre&s;ence of her mother. Dun&s;tan conjectured
the rea&s;on of the King's retreat; and carrying along
with him, Odo, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, over whom
he had gained an entire a&s;cendant, he bur&s;t into the apartment, upbraided Edwy with his la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, pro|bably
be&s;towed on the Queen the mo&s;t opprobrious
epithet which can be applied to her &s;ex, and tearing him
from her arms, pu&s;hed him back, in a di&s;graceful man|ner,
into the fe&s;tival of the nobles<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 7. O&s;berne, p. 83. 105. M. We&s;t. p. 195, 196.</NOTE>. Edwy, tho' young
and oppo&s;ed by the prejudices of the people, found an
opportunity of taking revenge for this public in&s;ult. He
que&s;tioned Dun&s;tan concerning the admini&s;tration of the
trea&s;ury during the reign of his predece&s;&s;or<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Wallingford, p. 542. A$lur. Beverl. p. 112.</NOTE>; and when
that mini&s;ter refu&s;ed to give any account of money,
expended, as he affirmed, by the late King's orders, he
accu&s;ed him of malver&s;ation in his office, and bani&s;hed

during his ab&s;ence: They filled the people's ears
with high $anegyrics on his &s;anctity: They exclaimed
again&s;t the impiety of the King and Queen: And hav|ing
poi&s;oned the minds of men by the&s;e declamations,
they proceeded to &s;till more outrageous violences again&s;t
the royal authority. Archbi&s;hop Odo &s;ent into the pa|lace
a party of &s;oldiers, who &s;eized the Queen, and hav|ing
burned her face with a red hot iron, in order to de|&s;troy
that fatal beauty, which had &s;educed Edwy, they
carried her by force into Ireland, there to remain in perpetual exile<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 84. Gerva&s;e, p. 1644.</NOTE>. Edwy, finding it in vain to re&s;i&s;t, was
obliged to con&s;ent to his divorce, which was pronounced
by Odo<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 425.</NOTE>; and a cata&s;trophe, &s;till more di&s;mal, awaited
the unhappy Elgiva. That amiable prince&s;s being cured
of her wounds, and having even obliterated the &s;cars,
with which Odo had hoped to deface her beauty, re|turned
into England, and was flying to the embraces of
the King, whom &s;he &s;till regarded as her hu&s;band; when
&s;he fell into the hands of a party, whom the primate had
ordered to intercept her. Nothing but her death could
now give &s;ecurity to Odo and the monks; and her mo&s;t
cruel death was requi&s;ite to &s;atiate their vengeance. She
was ham&s;tringed; and expired a few days after at Glo|ce&s;ter
in the mo&s;t acute torments<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">O&s;berne, p. 84. Gerva&s;e, p. 1645, 1646.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h, blinded with &s;uper&s;tition, in&s;tead of
being &s;hocked with this inhumanity, exclaimed that the
misfortunes of Edwy and his &s;pou&s;e were a ju&s;t judgment
on them for their di&s;&s;olute contempt of the eccle&s;i|a$tical
&s;tatutes. They even proceeded to rebellion again&s;t
their &s;overeign; and having placed Edgar at their head,
the younger brother of Edwy, a boy of thirteen years of
<PB N="123" REF="135">
age, they &s;oon put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mercia, Nor|thumberland,

The only difference is, that O&s;berne and &s;ome others call her his &s;trumpet, not his wife, as &s;he is &s;aid to be by Malme&s;bury. But this difference is ea&s;ily reconciled: For if Edwy married her contrary to the canons, the monks would be &s;ure to deny her to be his wife, and would in&s;i&s;t that &s;he could be nothing but his &s;trumpet: So that, on the whole, we may e&s;teem this repre&s;entation of the matter as certain; at lea&s;t, as by far the mo&s;t probable. If Edwy had only kept a mi&s;tre&s;s, it is well known, that there were methods of accommodation with the church, which would have prevented the clergy from proceeding to &s;uch extremities again&s;t him: But his marriage, contrary to the canons, was an in&s;ult on their authority, and called for tneir highe&s;t re&s;emment.</NOTE>.</P>

he con&s;ulted the&s;e prelates in the admini&s;tration of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and even in that of many civil; and
tho' the vigour of his own genius prevented him from
being implicitly guided by them, the King and the
bi&s;hops found &s;uch advantages in their mutual harmony,
that they acted always in concert, and united their influ|ence
in pre&s;erving the peace and tranquillity of the
public.</P>
<P>IN order to compleat the great work of placing the
new order of monks in all the convents, Edgar &s;um|moned
a general council of the prelates and the heads of the
religious orders. He here inveighed again&s;t the di&s;|&s;olute
lives of the &s;ecular clergy; the &s;mallne&s;s of their
ton&s;ure, which, it is probable, maintained no longer any
re&s;emblance to the crown of thorns; their negligence in
attending the exerci&s;e of their function; their mixing
with the laity in the plea&s;ures of gaming, hunting,
dancing and &s;inging; and their openly living with con|cubines,
by which it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed he meant
their wives. He then turned him&s;elf to Dun&s;tan the
primate; and in the name of the late King, Edred, his
father, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to look, down from Heaven
with indignation again&s;t all tho&s;e enormities, he thus
addre&s;&s;ed him. &startq;'Tis you, Dun&s;tan, by who&s;e advice
I founded mona&s;teries, built churches, and expended
my trea&s;ure in the &s;upport of religion and religious
hou&s;es. You was my coun&s;ellor and a&s;&s;i&s;tant in all
my &s;chemes: You was the director of my con&s;cience:
<PB N="127" REF="139">
To you I was obedient in all things. When did you
call for &s;upplies, which I refu&s;ed you? Was my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
ever wanting to the poor? Did I deny &s;upport
and e&s;tabli&s;hments to the clergy and, the convents?
Did I not hearken to your in&s;tructions, who told me,
that the&s;e charities were, of all others, the mo&s;t grate|ful
to my Maker, and fixed a perpetual fund for the
&s;upport of religion? And are all our pious endeavours
now fru&s;trated by the di&s;&s;olute lives of the prie&s;ts?
Not that I throw any blame on you: You have rea|&s;oned,
be&s;ought, inculcated, inveighed; But it be|hoves
you now to u&s;e &s;harper and more vigorous re|medies;
and conjoining your &s;piritual authority with
the civil power, to purge effectually the temple of
God from thieves and intruders<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Abbas Rieval. p. 360, 361. Spel. Conc. p. 476, 477, 478.</NOTE>.&endq; It is ea&s;y to ima|gine
that this harangue had the de&s;ired effect; and that,
when the King and prelates thus concurred with the
popular prejudices, it was not long before the monks
prevailed, and e&s;tabli&s;hed their new rules in almo&s;t all
the convents.</P>
<P>WE may remark, that the declamations again&s;t the
&s;ecular clergy are both here and in all the hi&s;torians,
conveyed in general terms; and as that order of men are
commonly re&s;trained by the decency of their character,
not to mention &s;uperior motives, it is difficult to believe
that the complaints again&s;t their di&s;&s;olute manners could
be &s;o univer&s;ally ju&s;t as is pretended. It is more pro|bable,
that the monks paid court to the populace by an
affected au&s;terity of life; and, repre&s;enting the mo&s;t in|nocent
liberties, taken by the other clergy, as great and
unpardonable enormities, thereby prepared the way for
the increa&s;e of their own power and influence. Edgar,
however, like a true politician, concurred with the pre|vailing
<PB N="128" REF="140">
party; and he even indulged them in preten&s;ions,
which, tho' they might, when complied with, engage
the monks to &s;upport royal authority during his own
reign, proved afterwards very dangerous to his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, and gave di&s;turbance to the whole civil power. He
&s;econded the policy of the court of Rome, in granting to
&s;ome mona&s;teries an exemption from epi&s;copal juri&s;dic|tion:
He allowed the convents, even tho&s;e of royal
foundation, to u&s;urp the election of their own abbot:
And he admitted their forgeries of antient charters, by
which, from the pretended grant of former kings, they
a&s;&s;umed like privileges and exemptions<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 118. W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 8. Seldeni Spi|$ileg. ad Eadm. p. 149. 157.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE merits of Edgar have procured him the highe&s;t
panegyrics from the monks; and he is tran&s;mitted to us
not only under the character of a great politician and an
active prince, prai&s;es to which he &s;eems to have been in|titled,
but under that of a great &s;aint and a man of vir|tue.
But nothing could more betray both his own hy|pocri&s;y
in inveighing again&s;t the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;e|cular
clergy, and the intere&s;ted &s;pirit of his partizans, in
be&s;towing &s;uch eulogies on his piety, than the u&s;ual te|nor
of his conduct, which was licentious to the highe&s;t
degree, and violated every law, human and divine. Yet
tho&s;e very monks, who, as we are told by Ingulf, a
very antient hi&s;torian, had no idea of any moral or re|ligious
merit, except cha&s;ity and obedience, not only
connived at his enormities, but loaded him with the
highe&s;t prai&s;es. Hi&s;tory, however, has pre&s;erved &s;ome
in&s;tances of his amours, from which, as from a &s;pecimen,
we may form a conjecture of the reft.</P>
<P>EDGAR broke into a convent, carried off Editha, a
nun, by force, and even committed violence on her per|&s;on<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 8. O&s;berne, p. 3. Diceto, p. 457. Higden, p. 265. 267, 268. Spell. Conc. p. 481.</NOTE>.
<PB N="129" REF="141">
For this act of &s;acrilege and brutality he was re|primanded
by Dun&s;tan; and that he might reconcile him|&s;elf
with the church, he was obliged, not to &s;eparate
from his mi&s;tre&s;s, but to ab&s;tain from wearing his crown
during &s;even years, and to deprive him&s;elf &s;o long of that

the mo&s;t odious colours. Such is the a&s;cendant which
may be attained, by hypocri&s;y and cabal, over man|kind!</P>
<P>THERE was another mi&s;tre&s;s of Edgar, called Elfleda,
with whom he fir&s;t formed a connexion by a kind of ac|cident.
Pa&s;&s;ing one day by Andover, he lodged in the
hou&s;e of a nobleman, who&s;e daughter, being endowed
with all the graces of per&s;on and behaviour, enflamed
him at fir&s;t fight with the highe&s;t de&s;ire, and made him
re&s;olve by any expedient to gratify it. As he had not
lei&s;ure to employ court&s;hip or addre&s;s for attaining his
purpo&s;e, he went directly to her mother, declared the
violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, and de&s;ired that the young lady might be allowed to pa&s;s that very night with him. The
mother was a woman of virtue, and determined not to
di&s;honour her daughter and her family by compliance;
but being well acquainted with the impetuo&s;ity of the
King's temper, &s;he thought it would be ea&s;ier, as well
as &s;afer, to deceive than refu&s;e him. She feigned there|fore
a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will; but &s;ecretly ordered a
waiting maid, of no di&s;agreeable figure, to &s;teal into the
<PB N="130" REF="142">
King's bed, after all the company &s;hould be retired to
re&s;t. In the morning, before day-break, the dam&s;el,
agreeable to the injunctions of her mi&s;tre&s;s, offered to re|tire;
but Edgar, who had no re&s;erve in his plea&s;ures,
and who&s;e love to his bedfellow was rather enflamed by
enjoyment, refu&s;ed his con&s;ent, and employed force and
entreaties to detain her. Elfleda, tru&s;ting to her own
charms, and to the love with which, &s;he hoped, &s;he had
now in&s;pired the King, made probably but a faint re&s;i&s;t|ance;
and the return of light di&s;covered the deceit to
Edgar. He had pa&s;&s;ed a night &s;o much to his &s;atisfac|tion,
that he expre&s;&s;ed no di&s;plea&s;ure with the old lady
on account of her fraud; his love was transferred to El|fleda;
&s;he became his favourite mi&s;tre&s;s, and maintained
her a&s;cendant over him, till his marriage with Elfrida<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 8. Higden, p. 268.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tances of his marriage with this lady
were more &s;ingular, and more criminal. Elfrida was
daughter and heir of Olgar, earl of Devon&s;hire; and
tho' &s;he had been educated in the country, and had ne|ver
appeared at court, &s;he had filled all England with
the reputation of her beauty. Edgar him&s;elf, who was
indifferent to no accounts of this nature, found his cu|rio&s;ity
excited by the frequent panegyrics which he heard
of Elfrida; and reflecting on her noble birth, he re&s;olv|ed,
if he found her charms an&s;werable to their fame, to
obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her on honourable terms. He com|municated
his intention to earl Athelwold, his favour|ite;
but u&s;ed the precaution, before he made any ad|vances
to her parents, to order that nobleman, on &s;ome
pretence, to pay them a vi&s;it, and to bring him a certain
account of the beauty of their daughter. Athelwold,
when introduced to the young lady, found general re|port
to have fallen much &s;hort of the truth; and being
inflamed with the highe&s;t love, he determined to &s;acri|fice
<PB N="131" REF="143">
to this new pa&s;&s;ion all his fidelity to his ma&s;ter, and
to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. He returned to Edgar, and
told him, that the riches alone, and high quality of El|frida,
had been the ground of the admiration paid her,
and that her charms, far from being any wi&s;e extraordi|nary,
would have been overlooked in a woman of infe|rior
&s;tation. When he had, by this deceit, turned the
King from his purpo&s;e, he took an opportunity, after
&s;ome interval, of turning again the conver&s;ation on El|frida;
and he remarked, that, tho' the parentage and
fortune of the lady had not produced on him, as on
others, any illu&s;ion with regard to her beauty, he could
not forbear reflecting, that &s;he would on the whole be
an advantageous match for him, and might, by her
birth and riches, make him a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for
the homeline&s;s of her per&s;on. If the King, therefore,
gave his approbation to the de&s;ign, he was determined to
make propo&s;als in his own behalf to the earl of Devon|shire,
and doubted riot to obtain his, as well as the
young lady's con&s;ent to the marriage. Edgar, plea&s;ed
with an expedient for e&s;tabli&s;hing his favourite's fortune,
not only exhorted him to execute his purpo&s;e, but for|warded
its &s;ucce&s;s by his recommendations to the parents
of Elfrida; and Athelwold was &s;oon made happy in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mi&s;tre&s;s. Dreading, however, the de|tection
of the artifice, he employed every pretence for
detaining Elfrida in the country, and for keeping her
at a di&s;tance from Edgar.</P>
<P>THE violent pa&s;&s;ion of Athelwold had concealed from
him the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences which mu&s;t attend his
conduct, and the advantages which the numerous ene|mies
that always pur&s;ue a royal favourite, would, by its
means, be able to make again&s;t him. Edgar was &s;oon
informed of the truth; but before he would execute ven|geance
on Athelwold's treachery, he re&s;olved to &s;atisfy
<PB N="132" REF="144">
him&s;elf with his own eyes of the certainty and full ex|tent
of his guilt. He told him, that he intended to pay
him a vi&s;it in his ca&s;tle, and be introduced to the ac|quaintance
of his new married wife; and Athelwold, as
he could not refu&s;e this honour, begged only leave to go
before him a few hours, that he might the better prepare
every thing for his reception. He then di&s;covered the
whole matter to Elfrida; and begged her, if &s;he had any
regard, either to her own honour or to his life, to con|ceal
from Edgar, by every circum&s;tance of dre&s;s and
behaviour, that fatal beauty, which had &s;educed him
from fidelity to his friend, and had betrayed him into &s;o
many fal&s;ehoods. Elfrida promi&s;ed compliance, tho'
nothing was farther from her intentions. She deemed
her&s;elf little beholden to Athelwold for a pa&s;&s;ion, which
had deprived her of a crown; and knowing the force of
her own charms, &s;he did not de&s;pair even yet of reach|ing
that &s;tation, of which her hu&s;band's artifice had be|reaved
her. She appeared before the King with all the
advantages which the riche&s;t attire, and the mo&s;t en|gaging
airs, could be&s;tow upon her, and excited at once
in his bo&s;om the highe&s;t love towards her&s;elf, and the
mo&s;t furious de&s;re of revenge again&s;t her hu&s;band. He
knew, however, how to di&s;&s;emble the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; and
&s;educing Athelwold into a wood, on pretence of hunt|ing,
he &s;tabbed him with his own hand, and &s;oon after
publicly e&s;pou&s;ed Elfrida<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s; lib. 2 cap. 8. Hoveden, p. 426. Brompton, p. 865, 866. Flor. Wigorn. p. 606. Higden, p. 268.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BEFORE we conclude our account of this reign, we
mu&s;t mention two circum&s;tances, which are remarked
by hi&s;torians. The reputation of Edgar allured a great
number of foreigners to vi&s;it his court; and he gave
them encouragement to re&s;ide in England<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 116. H. Hunting. lib. 5. 356. Brompton, p. 865.</NOTE>. We are
told, that they imported all the vices of their re&s;pective
<PB N="133" REF="145">
countries, and contributed to corrupt the &s;imple manners
of the natives<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 8.</NOTE>: But as this &s;implicity of manners, &s;o
highly and often &s;o injudiciou&s;ly extolled, pre&s;erved them
not from barbarity and treachery, the greate&s;t of all
vices, and the mo&s;t incident to a rude uncultivated pe|ople,
we ought perhaps to deem their acquaintance with
foreigners rather an advantage; as it tended to enlarge
their views, and to cure them of tho&s;e illiberal prejudices
and ru&s;tic manners to which i&s;landers are often &s;ubject.</P>
<P>ANOTHER remarkable incident of this reign was the
extirpation of wolves from England. This advantage
was attained by the indu&s;trious policy of Edgar. He
took great pains in hunting and pur&s;uing tho&s;e ravenous
animals; and when he found, that they had all taken
&s;helter in the mountains and fore&s;ts of Wales, he chan|ged
the tribute of money impo&s;ed on the Wel&s;h princes
by Athel&s;tan, his predece&s;&s;or<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 6. Brompton, p. 838.</NOTE>. into an annual tribute of
three hundred heads of wolves; which produced &s;uch di|ligence
in hunting them, that the creature has been no
more &s;een in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>EDGAR died, after a reign of &s;ixteen years, and in the
thirty-third of his age. He was &s;ucceeded by Edward,
whom he had by his fir&s;t marriage with the daughter of
Earl Ordmer<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 8. Hoveden, p. 426. Knighton, p. 2313.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD the Martyr.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of this prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">957.</NOTE> who was only fifteen
years of age at his father's death, did not take place
without much difficulty and opposition. Elfrida, his
&s;tep-mother, had a &s;on, Ethelred, &s;even years old,
whom &s;he attempted to rai&s;e to the throne: She affirmed,
<PB N="134" REF="146">
that Edgar's marriage with the mother of Edward, was
expo&s;ed to in&s;uperable objections; and as &s;he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
great credit with her hu&s;band, &s;he had &s;ound means to
acquire partisans, who &s;econded all her preten&s;ions.
But the title of Edward was &s;upported by many advantages.
He was appointed &s;ucce&s;&s;or by the will of his fa|ther<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 427. Eadmer, p. 3:</NOTE> He was approaching to man's e&s;tate, and might
&s;oon be able to take into his own hands the reins of go|vernment:

over whom he had already acquired a great a&s;cendant<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, ex edit. Seldeni, p. 3,</NOTE>
and was determined to execute the will of Edgar in his

<P>IT was of great importance to Dun&s;tan and the monks,
to place on the throne a King favourable to their cau&s;e:
The &s;ecular clergy had &s;till partizans in England, who
de&s;ired to keep them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the convents, and of
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority. On the fir&s;t intelligence of
Edgar's death, Alfere, duke of Mercia, expelled the new
orders of monks from all the mona&s;teries which lay with|in
his juri&s;diction<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 123. W. Malmef. lib. 2. cap. 9. Hoveden, p. 427. Brompton, p. 870. Flor. Wigorn. p. 607.</NOTE>; but Elfwin, duke of Ea&s;t-Anglia,

the late laws enacted in their favour<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 427. Brompton, p. 870. Higden, 269.</NOTE> In order to &s;ettle
this controver&s;y, there were &s;ummoned &s;everal &s;ynods,
which, according to the practice of tho&s;e times, con&s;i&s;t|ed
partly of eccle&s;ia&s;tical members, partly of the lay no|bility.
The monks were able to prevail in all the&s;e a&s;|&s;emblies;
Tho', as it appears, contrary to the &s;ecret
wi&s;hes, if not the declared oppo&s;ition, of the leading
men in the nation<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Melme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 9.</NOTE>. They had more invention in
forging miracles to &s;upport their cau&s;e; or having been
&s;o fortunate as to obtain, by their pretended au&s;terities,
the character of piety, their miracles were better believed
by the populace.</P>
<P>IN one &s;ynod, Dun&s;tan, finding the majority of votes
again&s;t him, ro&s;e up, and informed the audience, that he
had, in that in&s;tant, received an immediate revelation in
behalf of the monks; and the a&s;&s;embly were &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed
at this intelligence, or probably &s;o overawed by the popu|lace,
that they proceeded no farther in their delibera|tions.
In another &s;ynod, a voice i&s;&s;ued from the cruci|fix,
and informed the members, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
the monks was founded on the will of heaven, and could
not be oppo&s;ed without impiety<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. lib. 2. cap. 9. O&s;berne, p. 112. Gerva&s;e, p. 1647. Brompton, p. 870. Higden, p. 269.</NOTE>. But the miracle per|formed
in the third &s;ynod was &s;till more alarming: The
floor of the hall, in which the a&s;&s;embly met, &s;unk of a

brui&s;ed or killed by the fall. It was remarked, that
Dun&s;tan had prevented that day the King from attending
the &s;ynod, and that the beam on which his own chair
&s;tood, was the only one which did not &s;ink under the

<P>EDWARD lived four years after his acce&s;&s;ion, and

death was memorable and tragical<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 124.</NOTE>. This young prince

rai&s;ed a party in favour of her own &s;on, he always &s;how|ed

de&s;ired &s;ome liquor to be brought him; and while he

partly from the e&s;tabli&s;hments which that nation had
obtained in the north of France, and which employed all
their &s;uperfluous hands to people and maintain them;
partly from the vigour and warlike &s;pirit of a long race of
Engli&s;h princes, who pre&s;erved the country in a po&s;ture
of defence by &s;ea and land, and either prevented or repel|led
every attempt of the invaders. But a new generation

who could no longer di&s;burthen them&s;elves on Norman|dy;
the Engli&s;h had rea&s;on to dread, that they would
again vi&s;it an i&s;land, to which they were invited, both by
the memory of their pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and by the expecta|tion
of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their countrymen, who, tho' long e&s;tabli&s;hed in the kingdom, were not yet thoroughly
united with the natives, nor had entirely forgot their in|veterate
habits of war and depredation: And as the pre|&s;ent

<P>THE Danes, before they dur&s;t attempt any important
enterprize again&s;t England, made a &s;mall incur&s;ion, by
way of trial;<NOTE PLACE="marg">981.</NOTE> and having landed from &s;even ve&s;&s;els near

with like &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 126. Hoveden, p. 427. Sim Dun. p. 161</NOTE>; and the invaders, having now found
affairs in a very different &s;ituation from that in which they
formerly appeared, encouraged their countrymen to a&s;|&s;emble
a greater force, and to hope for more con&s;iderable
advantages.<NOTE PLACE="marg">991.</NOTE> They landed in E&s;&s;ex under the command

Ethelred, to whom hi&s;torians give the epithet of
the <HI>Unready</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, vol. 1. p. 225.</NOTE>, in&s;tead of rou&s;ing his people to defend
with courage their honour and their property, hearkened
to the advice of Siricius, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury,
which was &s;econded by many of the degenerate nobility;

he bribed them to depart the kingdom<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 126. W. Malm. p. 62. H. Hunt. p. 357. Hoveden, p. 428.</NOTE>. This &s;hameful

The Danes appeared next year off the ea&s;tern

their arms, which repelled them. But the Engli&s;h, &s;en|&s;ible

fleet capable of repul&s;i$ng the enemy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 126.</NOTE>; tho' that judicious
mea&s;ure failed of &s;ucce&s;s, from the treachery of Alfric,
duke of $$$micia, who&s;e name is infamous in the annals of
that age, by the calamities which his repeated perfidy
brought upon his country. This nobleman had, in 983,
&s;ucceeded to his father, Alfere, in that exten&s;ive com|mand;
but being deprived of it two years after, and ba|ni&s;hed the kingdom<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 125. Chron, St. Petri di Burgo, p. 31. Brompton, p. 879.</NOTE>, he was obliged to employ all his
intrigue, and all his power, which was too great for a
&s;ubject, to be re&s;tored to his country, and re-in&s;tated in
his authority. Having had experience of the credit and
malevolence of his enemies, he thenceforth tru&s;ted for &s;e|curity,
not to his &s;ervices or to the affections of his fel|low
citizens, but to the influence which he had obtained
over his va&s;&s;als, and to the public calamities, which he
thought mu&s;t, in every revolution, render his a&s;&s;i&s;tance
nece&s;&s;ary. Having fixed this re&s;olution, he determined
to prevent all &s;uch &s;ucce&s;&s;es as might e&s;tabli&s;h the royal
authority, or render his own &s;ituation dependant and pre|carious.
As the Engli&s;h had formed the plan of &s;ur|rounding
and de&s;troying the Dani&s;h fleet in harbour, he
privately informed the enemy of their danger; and when
they put to &s;ea, in con&s;equence of this intelligence, he
de&s;erted, with the &s;quadron under his command, the
night before the engagement, and thereby di&s;appointed
all the efforts of his countrymen<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 127. W. Malm. p. 62. Higden, p. 270.</NOTE>. Ethelred, enraged
at this perfidy, &s;eized his &s;on, Alfgar, and ordered his
eyes to be put out<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 128. W. Malm. p. 62. H. Hunt. p. 358. Higden, p. 270.</NOTE>; But &s;uch was the power of Alfric,
<PB N="141" REF="157">
that he again forced him&s;elf into authority<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 357. Higden, p. 270;</NOTE> and tho'
he had given this &s;pecimen of his character, and received
this grievous provocation, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to en|tru&s;t
him anew with the government of Mercia. This
conduct of the court, which, in all its circum&s;tances, is
&s;o barbarous, imprudent, and weak, both merited and
progno&s;ticated the mo&s;t grievous calamities.</P>
<P>THE northern invaders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">993.</NOTE> now well acquainted with
the defencele&s;s condition of England, made a powerful
de&s;cent, under the command of Swein, King of Den|mark,
and Olave, King of Norway; and &s;ailing up the
Humber, &s;pread on all &s;ides their de&s;tructive ravages.
Linde&s;ey was laid wa&s;te; Banbury was de&s;troyed<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Chron. Mailr. p. 1$2. Sim. Dun. p. 162.</NOTE>; and
all the Northumbrians, tho' mo&s;tly of Dani&s;h de&s;cent,
were obliged either to join the victors, or to &s;uffer under
their depredations. A powerful army was a&s;&s;embled to
oppo&s;e the invaders, and a general action en&s;ued; but
the Engli&s;h were abandoned in the battle, by the cow|ardice
or treachery of their three leaders, all of them
men of Dani&s;h race, Frena, Frithegi&s;t, and Godwin,
who gave the example of a &s;hameful flight to the troops
under their command<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 128. H. Hunt. p. 357. Hoveden, p. 428. Brompton, p. 880.</NOTE></P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by this &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;till more by the
contempt which it in&s;pired of their enemy, the pirates
ventured to attack the center of the kingdom; and en|tering
the Thames in ninety-four ve&s;&s;els, laid &s;iege to
London, and threatened it with total de&s;truction. But
the citizens, alarmed with the danger, and firmly united
among them&s;elves, made a bolder defence than the cow|ardice
of the nobility and gentry gave the invaders rea&s;on
<PB N="142" REF="158">
to apprehend<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 63. H. Hunt. p. 358. Hoveden, p. 428.</NOTE>; and the be&s;iegers, after &s;uaffering the
greate&s;t hard&s;hips, were finally fru&s;trated, in their at|tempt.
In order to revenge them&s;elves, they laid wa&s;te
E&s;&s;ex, Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, and Hamp&s;hire; and having there
procured hor&s;es, they were thereby enabled to &s;pread, in|to
the more inland counties, the fury of their depreda|tions<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 128. W. Malm. p. 63. H. Hunt. p. 358. Hoveden, p. 428. Sim. Dun. p. 162, 163.</NOTE>. In this extremity, Ethelred and his nobles had
recour&s;e to the former expedient; and &s;ending amba&s;&s;a|dors
to the two northern kings, they promi&s;ed them &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
and tribute, on condition they would, for the
pre&s;ent, put an end to their ravages, and &s;oon after de|part
the kingdom. Sweyn and Olave agreed to the
terms, and peaceably took up their quarters at Southamp|ton,
where the &s;um of &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds was paid
them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 129. Hoveden, p. 428. Chron. Mailr. p. 152.</NOTE>. Olave even made a journey to Andover, where
Ethelred re&s;ided; and he received the rite of confirmation
from the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops, as well as many rich pre&s;ents
from the King. He here promi&s;ed, that he would never
more infe&s;t the Engli&s;h territories, and he faithfully per|formed
that engagement<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. 129. H. Hunt. p. 358. Hoveden, p. 428. Chron. Mailr. p. 152. Sim. Dun, p. 163. Brompton, p. 880.</NOTE>. This prince receives the ap|pellation

<P>THIS compo&s;ition brought but a &s;hort interval to the
mi&s;eries of the Engli&s;h.<NOTE PLACE="marg">997.</NOTE> The Dani&s;h pirates appeared
<PB N="143" REF="159">
&s;oon after in the Severne; and having committed &s;poil in
Wales, as well as in Cornwall and Devon, they &s;ailed
round to the &s;outh-coa&s;t, and entering the Tamar, com|pleated
the deva&s;tation of the&s;e two counties. They then
returned to the Bri&s;tol-channel; and penetrating into
the country by the Avon, &s;pread them&s;elves over all that
neighbourhood, and carried fire and &s;word even into
Dor&s;et&s;hire<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 129. Hoveden, p. 428. Sim. Dun. 163.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">998.</NOTE> They next changed the &s;eat of war; and
after ravaging the Ifle of Wight, they entered the

After this victory, the whole province of Kent was made
a &s;cene of &s;laughter, fire and deva&s;tation. The extremi|ty
of the&s;e mi&s;eries forced the Engli&s;h into councils for
common defence both by &s;ea and land; but the weak|ne&s;s
of the King, the divi&s;ions of the nobility, the trea|chery
of &s;ome, the cowardice of others, the want of con|cert
in all, fru&s;trated every endeavour; and their Heets
and armies either came too late to attack the enemy, or
were repul&s;ed with di&s;honour; and the people were thus
equally ruined by re&s;i&s;tance or by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 129, 130. W. Malm. p. 63. Hoveden, p. 429. Higden, p. 271. Sim. Dun. p. 164.</NOTE>. The
Engli&s;h, therefore, devoid both of prudence and unani|mity
in council, of courage and conduct in the field, had
recour&s;e to the &s;ame weak expedient, which by experi|ence
they might have already found &s;o ineffectual; and
they offered the Danes to buy peace by paying them a
large &s;um of money. The&s;e ravagers ro&s;e continually
in their demands; and now required the payment of
24,000 l. which the Engli&s;h were &s;o mean and impru|dent
as to &s;ubmit to<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 429. Chron. Mailr. p. 153. Sim. Dun. p. 164.</NOTE>. The departure of the Danes Pro|cuted
<PB N="144" REF="160">
them a &s;hort interval of repo&s;e, which they enjoy|ed
as if it were to be perpetual, without making any ef|fectual
preparations for giving them a more vigorous re|ception
upon their next return.</P>
<P>BESIDES receiving this &s;um, the Danes were engaged
by another circum&s;tance to depart a kingdom, which ap|peared
&s;o little in a &s;ituation to re&s;i&s;t their efforts: They
were invited over by their countrymen in Normandy,
who at this time were hard pre&s;&s;ed by the arms of Robert,
King of France, and who found it difficult to defend the
&s;ettlement, which with &s;o much advantage to them&s;elves
and glory to their nation, they had made in that country.
It is probable, al&s;o, that Ethelred, ob&s;erving the clo&s;e
connexions, thus maintained among all the Danes,
however divided in government or &s;ituation, was de&s;irous
of procuring an alliance with that formidable people;
and for this purpo&s;e, being now a widower, he made his
addre&s;&s;es to Emma, &s;i&s;ter to Richard II. duke of Nor|mandy,

Rollo, a petty prince or chieftain in Denmark, who&s;e

He was expo&s;ed in his youth to the jealou&s;y of
the King of Denmark, who attacked his &s;mall, but inde|pendant

peace; and falling &s;uddenly upon him, he murder|ed
his brother and his brave&s;t officers, and forced him to
fly for &s;afety into Scandinavia. Here many of his antient
&s;ubjects, induced partly by affection to their prince, part|ly
by the oppre&s;&s;ions of the Dani&s;h Monarch, ranged
them&s;elves under his &s;tandard, and offered to follow him
in every enterprize. Rollo, in&s;tead of attempting to re|cover
his paternal dominions, where he mu&s;t expect a
vigorous re&s;i&s;tance from the Danes, determined to pur&s;ue
an ea&s;ier, but more important undertaking, and to make
his fortune, in imitation of his countrymen, by pillaging
the richer and more &s;outhern coa&s;ts of Europe. He col|lected
a body of troops, which like that of all the&s;e ra|vagers,
was compo&s;ed of Norwegians, Swedes, Fri&s;ians,
Danes, and adventurers of all nations, who, being ac|cu&s;tomed
to a roving, un&s;ettled life, took delight in no|thing
but war and plunder. His reputation drew him
a&s;&s;ociates from, all quarters; and a vi&s;ion, which he pre|tended

according to his interpretation of it, progno&s;ticated to
him the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, proved al&s;o a powerful incen|tive

<P>THE fir&s;t attempt of Rollo was on England, near
the end of Alfred's reign; when that great monarch, having
&s;ettled Guthrun and his followers in Ea&s;t-Anglia, and
others of the&s;e free-booters in Northumberland, and ha|ving
re&s;tored peace to his harra&s;&s;ed country, had e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
the mo&s;t excellent military, as well as civil in&s;titutions
among the Engli&s;h. The prudent Dane, finding that
no advantages could be gained, over &s;uch a people, go|verned
by fuch a prince, &s;oon turned his enterprizes
again&s;t France, which he found more expo&s;ed to his in|roads<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 2. cap. 6.</NOTE>;
<PB N="146" REF="162">
and during the reigns of Eudes, an u&s;urper, and
of Charles the Simple, a weak prince, he committed the
mo&s;t de&s;tructive ravages on the inland, as well as mari|time
provinces of that kingdom. The French, having
no means of defence againft a chie&s;tain, who united all
the valour of his countrymen with the policy of more ci|vilized
nations, were obliged to &s;ubmit to the expedient
practi&s;ed by Alfred, and to offer the invaders a &s;ettlement
in &s;ome of tho&s;e provinces, which they had depopulated
by their arms<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Dudo, p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on why the Danes for many years pur&s;ued
mea&s;ures &s;o different from tho&s;e embraced by the Goths,
Vandals, Franks, Burgundians, Lombards, and other
northern conquerors, was the great difference, in the
method of attack which was practi&s;ed by the&s;e &s;everal na|tions,
and to which the nature of their particular &s;itua|tions
nece&s;&s;arily confined them. The latter tribes, living
in an inland country, made incur&s;ions by land upon the
Roman empire; and when they entered far into the
frontiers, they were obliged to carry along with them
their wives and families, whom they had no hopes of
&s;oon re-vl&s;iting, and who could not otherwi&s;e participate
of their plunder. This circum&s;tance quickly made them
think of forcing a &s;ettlement in the provinces, which they
had over-run; and the&s;e barbarians, &s;preading them|&s;elves
over the country, found an intere&s;t in protecting
the property and indu&s;try of the people, whom they &s;ub|dued.
But the Danes and Norwegians, invited by their
maritime &s;ituation, and obliged to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves in
their uncultivated country by fi&s;hing, had acquired &s;ome
experience of navigation; and in their military excur&s;ions pur&s;ued the method practi&s;ed again&s;t the Roman empire
by the more early Saxons: They made de&s;cents in &s;mall
bodies from their &s;hips or rather boats, and ravaging the
<PB N="147" REF="163">
coa&s;ts, returned with the booty to their families, whom
they could not conveniently carry along with them in
the&s;e hazardous enterprizes. But when they increa&s;ed
their armaments, made incur&s;ions into the inland coun|tries,
and found it &s;afe to remain longer in the mid&s;t
of the enemy, they had been accu&s;tomed to crowd their
ve&s;&s;els with their wives and children, and having no
longer any temptation to return into their own country,
they willingly embraced an opportunity of &s;ettling in the
warm climates and cultivated fields of the &s;outh.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS were in this &s;ituation with Rollo and his fol|lowers,
when Charles propo&s;ed to relinqui&s;h to them the
province formerly called Neu&s;tria, and to purcha&s;e peace
of them on the&s;e hard conditions. After all the terms
were fully agreed, there appeared only once circum&s;tance
&s;hocking to the haughty Dane: He was required to do
homage to Charles for his province, and to put him&s;elf in
that humiliating po&s;ture, impo&s;ed on va&s;&s;als by the rites
of the feudal law. He long refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to this in|dignity;
but being unwilling to lo&s;e &s;uch important ad|vantages
for a mere ceremony, he made a &s;acrifice of his
pride to his intere&s;t, and acknowledged him&s;elf in form
the va&s;&s;al of the French monarch<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 417.</NOTE>. Charles gave him
his daughter, Gi&s;la, in marriage; and that he might
bind him fa&s;ter to his intere&s;ts, made him a donation of
a con&s;iderable territory, be&s;ides what he was obliged to
&s;urrender to him by his &s;tipulations. When &s;ome of the
French nobles informed him, that, in return for &s;o gene|rous
a pre&s;ent, it was expeted, that he &s;hould throw
him&s;elf at the King's feet, and make &s;uitable acknow|ledgments
for his bounty; Rollo replied, that he would
rather break off the whole treaty; and it was with &s;ome
difficulty they could per&s;uade him to make that compli|ment
by one of his captains. The Dane, commi&s;&s;ioned
<PB N="148" REF="164">
for this purpo&s;e, full of indignation at the order, and
de&s;pi&s;ing &s;o unwarlike a prince, caught Charles by the
foot, and pretending to carry it to his mouth, that he
might ki&s;s it, overthrew him before all his courtiers.
The French nation, &s;en&s;ible of their pre&s;ent weakne&s;s,
found it prudent to overlook this in&s;ult<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 2. cap. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ROLLO, who was now in the decline of life, and was
tired of wars and depredations, applied him&s;elf with ma|ture
councils, to the &s;ettlement of his new acquired
territory, which was thenceforth called Normandy; and
he parcelled it out among his captains and followers.
He followed in this partition the cu&s;toms of the feudal
law, which was then univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;outhern
countries of Europe, and which &s;uited the peculiar cir|cum&s;tances
of that age. He treated the French
&s;ubjects who &s;ubmitted to him, with mildne&s;s and
ju&s;tice; he reclaimed his ancient followers from their
ferocity and violence; he e&s;tabli&s;hed law and order
throughout his &s;tate; and after a life, &s;pent in tumults
and ravages, he died peaceably in a good old age, and left
his dominions to his po&s;terity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 2. cap. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE></P>

years after the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Normans in
France. This was the duke, who gave his &s;i&s;ter, Em|ma,
in marriage to Ethelred, King of England, and
who thereby formed connexions, with a country, which
his po&s;terity were &s;o &s;oon after de&s;tined to &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>THE Danes had been e&s;tabli&s;hed during a longer pe|riod
in England than in France; and tho' the &s;imilarity
of their original language to that of the Saxons invited
them to a more early coalition with the natives, they
had found, as yet, &s;o little example of civilized manners
among the Engli&s;h, that they retained all their ancient
ferocity, and valued them&s;elves only on their national
character of military bravery. The recent, as well as
more antient atchievements of their countrymen, tended
to &s;u&s;tain this idea; and the Engli&s;h princes, particularly
Athel&s;tan and Edgar, &s;en&s;ible of that &s;uperiority, had
been accu&s;tomed to keep-in pay bodies of Dani&s;h troops,
who were quartered about the country, and committed
many violences upon the inhabitants. The&s;e mercena|ries
had attained to &s;uch a height of luxury, according
to the old Engli&s;h writers<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wallingford, p. 547.</NOTE>, that they combed their hair
once a day, bathed them&s;elves once a week, changed
their cloaths frequently; and by all the&s;e arts of effe|minacy,
as well as by their military character, had ren|dered
them&s;elves &s;o agreeable to the fair &s;ex, that they
debauched the wives and daughters of the Engli&s;h, and
had di&s;honoured many families. But what mo&s;t provoked
the inhabitants, was, that, in&s;tead of defending them
again&s;t invaders, they were ever ready to betray them to
the foreign Danes, and to a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves with all
the &s;traggling parties of that nation. The animo&s;ity be|tween
<PB N="150" REF="166">
the inhabitants of Engli&s;h and Dani&s;h race, had,
from the&s;e repeated injuries, ri&s;en to a great height;
when Ethelred, from a policy incident to weak princes,
embraced the cruel re&s;olution of ma&s;&s;acring the latter
throughout all his dominions<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Almo&s;t all the antient hi&s;torians &s;peak of this ma&s;&s;acre of the Danes as if it had been univer&s;al, and as if every individual of that nation throughout England had been put to death.

This repre&s;en&s;tation therefore of the matter is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. Great re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t have been made, and violent wars in&s;ued; which was not the ca&s;e. This account given by Wallingford, tho' he &s;tands &s;ingle, mu&s;t be admitted as the only true one. We are told, that the name <HI>Lurdane, lord Dane,</HI> for an idle lazy fellow, who lives at other people's expence, came from the conduct of the Danes, who were put to death. But the Engli&s;h princes had been entirely ma&s;ters for &s;everal generations; and only &s;upported a military corps of that nation.

the prince, from whom death had &s;o lately delivered them.
He ravaged the ea&s;tern coa&s;t with mercile&s;s fury, and put

the counties of Dor&s;et, Wilts, and Somer&s;et; where an
army was a&s;&s;embled again&s;t him, under the command of
prince Edmond and duke Edric. The latter &s;till conti|nued
his perfidious machinations; and after endeavour|ing
in vain to get the prince into his power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1015.</NOTE> found

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this misfortune, Edmond was
hot di&s;concerted; but a&s;&s;embling together all the force of
England, was in a condition to give the enemy battle.
The King had had &s;uch frequent experience of perfidy
among his &s;ubjects, that he had lo&s;t all confidence in
them; and he remained at London, pretending &s;ick|nefs,

commit equal ravages with tho&s;e practi&s;ed by the Danes<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 147. Hoveden, p. 434.</NOTE>;
and after making &s;ome fruitle&s;s expeditions into the north,
which had &s;ubmitted entirely to Canute's power, he re|tired
to London, determined there to maintain to the
la&s;t extremity the &s;mall remains of Engli&s;h liberty. He
here found every thing in confu&s;ion by the death of
the King, who expired after an unhappy and inglorious
reign of thirty-five years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1016.</NOTE> He left two &s;ons by his fir&s;t

<HEAD>EDMOND Iron&s;ide.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prince, who received the name of Iron&s;ide from
his hardy valour, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed courage and abilities &s;uffi|cient
to have &s;aved his country from &s;inking into the&s;e
calamities, but not to rai&s;e it from that aby&s;s of mi&s;ery
into which it had already fallen. Among the other mi&s;|fortunes
of the Engli&s;h, treachery and difaffection had
crept in among the nobility and prelates; and Edmond
found no better expedient to prevent the farther progre&s;s
of the&s;e fatal evils, than to lead his army in&s;tantly into the
<PB N="157" REF="173">
field, and to employ them again&s;t the common enemy.
After meeting with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s at Gillingham<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72. H. Hunt. p. 363. Hoveden, p. 434. Higden, p. 273.</NOTE>. he pre|pared
him&s;elf in one general engagement to decide the
fate of his crown, and at Scoer&s;ton, in the county of
Gloce&s;ter, he offered battle to the enemy, who were
commanded by Canute and Edric. Fortune in the begin|ning
of the day declared for him; but Edric, having cut
off the head of one O&s;mer, who&s;e countenance re&s;embled
that of Edmond, he fixed it on a &s;pear, carried it thro' the
ranks in triumph, and called aloud to the Engli&s;h, that
it was time for them to fly; for behold! the head of
their &s;overeign<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72. Hoveden, p. 435. Higden, p. 273.</NOTE> And tho' Edmond, ob&s;erving the con|&s;ternation
of the troops, took off his helmet<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72.</NOTE>, and
&s;howed him&s;elf to them, the utmo&s;t he could gain by
his activity and valour was to leave the victory undecid|ed.
Edirc took now a &s;urer method to ruin him, by
pretending to de&s;ert to him; and as Edmond was well
acquainted with his power, and probably knew no other
of the chief nobility in whom he could repo&s;e more con|fidence,
he was obliged, notwith&s;tanding his repeated
perfidy, to give him a con&s;iderable command in his army<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72. Hoveden, p. 435.</NOTE>.
A battle &s;oon after en&s;ued at A&s;&s;ington in E&s;&s;ex; where
Edric, flying in the beginning of the day, occa&s;ioned the
total defeat of the Engli&s;h, followed by a great &s;laughter
of the nobility<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72. Hoveden, p. 435. Higden, p. 274. Wallingford, p. 549.</NOTE>. The indefatigable Edmond, however,
had &s;till re&s;ources; and a&s;&s;embling a new army at Glo|ce&s;ter,
was again in a condition to di&s;pute the field;
when the Dani&s;h and Engli&s;h nobility, equally harra&s;&s;ed
with the&s;e convul&s;ions, obliged their kings to come to a
compromi&s;e, and to divide the kingdom between them
by treaty. Canute re&s;erved to him&s;elf the northern di|vi&s;ion
<PB N="158" REF="174">
of Mercia, Ea&s;t-Anglia, and Northumberland,
which he had entirely &s;ubdued: The &s;outhern parts were
left to Edmond<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 72.</NOTE>. This prince &s;urvived the treaty about
a month; and was murdered at Oxford by two of his

<HEAD>CANUTE the Great.</HEAD>
<P>THE Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1017.</NOTE> who had been unable to defend their
country, and maintain their independancy, under &s;o
active and brave a prince as Edmond, could, after his
death, expect nothing but total &s;ubjection from Canute,
who, active and brave him&s;elf, was at the head of a
great force, and was ready to take advantage of the mi|nority
of Edwin and Edward, the two &s;ons of Edmond.
Yet this conqueror, who was commonly &s;o little &s;crupu|lous,
&s;howed him&s;elf anxious to cover his inju&s;tice under
plau&s;ible pretences; and before he &s;eized the dominions
of the Engli&s;h princes, he &s;ummoned a general a&s;&s;embly
of the &s;tates of England, in order to fix the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of the kingdom. He here &s;uborned &s;ome nobles to de|po&s;e,
that, in the treaty of Gloce&s;ter, it was agreed,
that, in ca&s;e of Edmond's death, Canute &s;hould either
be his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in his dominions, or be tutor to his chil|dren
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 436. Higden, p. 274. Sim. Dun. p. 175. Abbas Rieval. p. 565. Brompton, p. 907.</NOTE> (for hi&s;torians vary in this particular): And this
evidence, &s;upported by the great power of Canute, de|termined
the &s;tates immediately to put the Dani&s;h mo|narch
in p&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government. Canute, jealous
of the two young princes, but &s;en&s;ible that he &s;hould
<PB N="159" REF="175">
render him&s;elf extremely odious, if he ordered them to
be di&s;patched in England, &s;ent them abroad to his ally,
the king of Sweden, whom he de&s;ired, &s;o &s;oon as they
arrived at his court, to rid him, by their death, of all
farther anxiety. The Swedi&s;h monarch was too gene|rous
to comply with this reque&s;t; but being afraid to
draw on him&s;elf a quarrel with Canute, by protecting
the Engli&s;h princes, he &s;ent them to Solomon, King of
Hungary, to be educated in his court<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 73. Hoveden, p. 436. Chron. Mailr. p. 155. Higden, p. 275. Sim. Dun. p. 176. Diceto, p. 466.</NOTE>. The elder,
Edwin, was afterwards married to Solomon's &s;i&s;ter;
but dying without i&s;&s;ue, that prince gave his &s;i&s;ter-in-law,
Agatha, daughter of the Emperor Henry II. in mar|riage
to Edward, the younger brother; and &s;he bore him
Edgar Atheling, Margaret, afterwards Queen of Scot|land,
and Chri&s;tina, who retired into a convent.</P>
<P>CANUTE, tho' he had reached his great point of am|bition,
in obtaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h crown, was
obliged at fir&s;t to make great &s;acrifices to it; and to gra|tify
the chief of the nobility, by be&s;towing on them the
mo&s;t exten&s;ive governments and juri&s;dictions. He created
Thurkill earl or duke of Ea&s;t-Anglia, (for the&s;e titles
were then nearly of the &s;ame import) Yric of Northum|berland,
and Edric of Mercia; re&s;erving only to himself
the admini&s;tration of We&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 151. W. Malm. p. 73. Hoveden, p. 436, Higden, p. 274. Brompton, p. 906.</NOTE>. But &s;eizing afterwards
a favourable opportunity, he expelled Thurkill and Yric
from their governments, and bani&s;hed them the king|dom<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 437.</NOTE>: He put to death $many of the Engli&s;h nobility, on
who&s;e fidelity he could no&punc; rely, and whom he hated
<PB N="160" REF="176">
on account of their infidelity to their native prince<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 363. Abbas Rieval. p. 365.</NOTE>:
And even the traitor, Edric, having had the a&s;&s;urance
to reproach him with his &s;ervices, was condemned to be
executed, and his body to be thrown into the Thames;
a &s;uitable reward for his multiplied acts of perfidy and
rebellion<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 73. Hoveden, p. 436.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CANUTE al&s;o found him&s;elf obliged, in the begin|ning
of his reign, to load the people with heavy taxes,
in order to reward his Dani&s;h followers; and he exacted
from them at one time the &s;um of 72,000 pounds; be|&s;ides
11,000 pounds, which he levied from London
alone<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 151. H. Hunt. p. 363. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 37</NOTE>. He was probably willing, from political mo|tives,
to mulct &s;everely that city, on account of its af|fectionate
adhering to Edmond, and its re&s;i&s;ting, dur|ing
the late reign, the Dani&s;h power in two ob&s;tinate
&s;ieges<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W Malm. p. 72. In one of the&s;e &s;ieges, Canute diverted the cour&s;e of the Thames, and by that means brought hi &s;hips above Lon|don bridge.</NOTE> But the&s;e rigors were imputed to nece&s;&s;ity;
and Canute, like a wi&s;e prince, was determined, that
the Engli&s;h people, now deprived of all their dangerous
leaders, &s;hould be reconciled to the Dani&s;h yoke, by the
ju&s;tice and equality of his administration<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 58.</NOTE>. He &s;ent back
to Denmark as many of his followers as he could &s;afely
&s;pare; He re&s;tored the Saxon cu&s;toms in a general a&s;|&s;embly
of the &s;tates of the kingdom<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 151. Chron. Mailr. p. 155. Higden, p. 275.</NOTE>: He made no di&s;|tinction
between Danes and Engli&s;h in the di&s;tribution
of ju&s;tice<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. p. 73.</NOTE>: And he took care, by a &s;trict execution of
law, to protect the lives and properties of all his people.
The Danes were gradually incorporated with his new
&s;ubjects; and both were glad to breathe a little from
tho&s;e multiplied calamities, from which the one, no le&s;s
<PB N="161" REF="177">
than the other, had, in their fierce conte&s;t for power,
experienced &s;uch fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE removal of Edmond's children into &s;o di&s;tant a
country as Hungary, was, next to their death, regarded by Canute as the greate&s;t &s;ecurity of his government;
and he had no farther anxiety, except with regard to
Alfred and Edward, who were protected and &s;upported
by their uncle, Richard, duke of Normandy. Richard
even fitted out a great armament, in order to re&s;tore the
Engli&s;h princes to the throne of their ance&s;tors, and
tho' the navy was di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, Canute &s;aw the
danger to which he was expo&s;ed, from the animo&s;ity of
&s;o warlike a people as the Normans. In order to ac|quire
the friend&s;hip of the duke, he paid his addre&s;s to
Queen Emma, the &s;i&s;ter of that prince; and promi&s;ed,
that he would leave the children whom he &s;hould have
by that marriage, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown of England.
Richard complied with his demand, and &s;ent over Em|ma
to England, where &s;he was &s;oon after married to
Canute<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 151. W. Malme&s;. p. 73.</NOTE>. The Engli&s;h, tho' they di&s;approved of her
e&s;pou&s;ing the mortal enemy of her former hu&s;band and
his family, were plea&s;ed to find at court a &s;overeign to
whom they were accu&s;tomed, and who had already form|ed
connections with them: And thus Canute, be&s;ides
&s;ecuring, by his marriage, the alliance of Normandy,
gradually acquired, by the &s;ame means, the confidence
of his own people<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. p. 73. Higden, p. 275.</NOTE>. The Norman prince &s;urvived not
long the marriage of Emma; and he left the inheritance
of the dutchy to his elde&s;t &s;on of the &s;ame name; who,
dying a year after him without children, was &s;ucceeded
by his brother Robert, a man of valour and ability.</P>
<P>CANUTE, having &s;ettled his power in England be|yond
all danger of a revolution, made a voyage to Den|mark,
<PB N="162" REF="178">
where he was attacked by the King of Sweden;
and he carried along with him a great body of the Eng|li&s;h, under the command of earl-Godwin. This noble|man
had here an opportunity of performing a &s;ervice,
by which he both reconciled the King's mind to the
Engli&s;h nation, and gaining to him&s;elf the friend&s;hip of
that prince, laid the foundation of that immen&s;e fortune
which he acquired to his family. He was &s;tationed next
the Swedi&s;h camp; and ob&s;erving a favourable opportu|nity,
which he was obliged &s;uddenly to &s;eize, he at|tacked
the enemy in the night, drove them from their
trenches, threw them into di&s;order, pur&s;ued his ad|vantage,
and obtained a deci&s;ive victory over them.
Next morning, Canute, &s;eeing the Engli&s;h camp en|tirely
abandoned, imagined that the&s;e di&s;affected troops
had de&s;erted to the enemy; and he was agreeably &s;ur|pri&s;ed
to find that they were at that time engaged in
pu&s;uit of the di&s;comfited Swedes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 73. H. Hunt. p. 364. Higden, p. 275. Bromp|ton, p. 908. Matth. We&s;t. p. 207.</NOTE>. He was &s;o plea&s;ed
with this &s;ucce&s;s, and the manner of obtaining it, that
he be&s;towed his daughter in marriage upon Godwin,
and treated him ever after with the mo&s;t entire confi|dence
and regard.</P>
<P>IN another voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1028.</NOTE> which he made afterwards to Den|mark,
Canute attacked Norway, and expelled the ju&s;t,
but unwarlike Olaus, from his kingdom, of which he
retained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the death of that prince<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 153. H. Hunt. p. 364. Hoveden, p. 437. Chron. Mailr. p. 155. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 38.</NOTE>. He
had now by his conque&s;ts and valour attained the utmo&s;t
height of his ambition; and having lei&s;ure from wars
and intrigues, he felt the un&s;atisfactory nature of all
human enjoyments; and equally weary of the glories
and turmoils of this life, he began to ca&s;t his view to|wards

that future exi&s;tence, which it is &s;o natural for
the human mind, whether &s;atiated by pro&s;perity or di&s;|gu&s;ted with adver&s;ity, to make the object of its atten|tion.
Unfortunately, the &s;pirit which prevailed in that
age gave a wrong direction to his devotion; and in&s;tead
of making atonement to tho&s;e whom he had injured by
his former acts of violence, he employed him&s;elf entirely
in tho&s;e exerci&s;es of piety, which the monks repre&s;ented
as the mo&s;t meritorious. He built churches, he endow|ed
mona&s;teries<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 61.</NOTE>, he enriched the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and he
be&s;towed revenues for the &s;upport of chantries at A&s;&s;ing|ton

again&s;t him<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 73. Diceto, p. 467.</NOTE>. He even undertook a pilgrimage to

be&s;ides obtaining from the Pope &s;ome privileges for the

through who&s;e dominions he was obliged to pa&s;s, to de|&s;i&s;t
from tho&s;e heavy impo&s;itions and tolls, which they
were accu&s;tomed to exact from the Engli&s;h pilgrims<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 74, 75. Hoveden, p. 437. Ingulf, p. 59, 60. Higden, p. 275. Sim. Dun. p. 178.</NOTE>.
By this &s;pirit of devotion, no le&s;s than by his equitable
and politic admini&s;tration, he gained, in a good mea|&s;ure, the affections of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>CANUTE, who was the greate&s;t and mo&s;t powerful
prince of his time, &s;overeign of Denmark and Norway,
as well as of England, could not fail to meet with adu|lation
from his courtiers; a tribute which is liberally
paid even to the meane&s;t and weake&s;t princes. Some of
his flatterers breaking out, one day, in admiration of
his grandeur, exclaimed that every thing was po&s;&s;ible for

him: Upon which the monarch, it is &s;aid, ordered his
chair to be &s;et on the &s;ea-&s;hore, while the tide was mak|ing;
and as the waters approached, he commanded them
to retire, and to obey the voice of him who was lord of the ocean. He feigned to &s;it &s;ome time in expectation
of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but when the &s;ea &s;till advanced to|wards
him, and began to wa&s;h him with its billows, he
turned to his courtiers, and remarked to them, that
every creature in the univer&s;e was feeble and impotent,
and that power re&s;ided with one Being alone, in who&s;e
hands were all the elements of nature, who could &s;ay to

<P>THE only memorable action which Canute performed
after his return from Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1031.</NOTE> was an expedition again&s;t
Malcolm, King of Scotland<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 153, 154.</NOTE>. During the reign of
Ethelred, there had been impo&s;ed a tax of a &s;hilling a
hide on all the lands of England, which was commonly
called <HI>Danegelt;</HI> becau&s;e the revenue had been employed,
either in buying peace with the Danes, or in making preparations again&s;t the inroads of that ho&s;tile nation.</P>
<P>That prince had required, that the &s;ame tax &s;hould be
paid by the lands of Cumberland, which were held by
the Scots; but Malcolm, a warlike prince, told him,
that, as he was always able to repul&s;e the Danes by his
own power, he would neither &s;ubmit to buy peace of
his enemies, nor pay others for re&s;i&s;ting them. Ethel|red,
offended at this reply, which contained a &s;ecret re|proach
of his own conduct, undertook an expedition
again&s;t Cumberland; and tho' he committed ravages
upon the country<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 33. Sim. Dun. p. 164. Flor, Wigom. p. 610.</NOTE>, he could never bring Malcolm to a

temper more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive or compliant. Canute, after
his acce&s;&s;ion, &s;ummoned the Scotti&s;h King to acknow|ledge
him&s;elf a va&s;&s;al for Cumberland to the crown of
England; but Malcolm refu&s;ed compliance, on pretence
that he owed this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion only to tho&s;e princes, who
by right of blood inherited that kingdom. Canute was
not of a temper to bear this in&s;ult; and the King of
Scotland &s;oon found, that the &s;ceptre was in very dif|ferent
hands from tho&s;e of the feeble and irre&s;olute
Ethelred. Upon Canute's appearing on his frontiers
with a formidable army, Malcolm agreed, that his grand|&s;on
and heir, Duncan, whom he put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Cumberland, &s;hould make the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions required, and
that the heirs of Scotland &s;hould always acknowledge
them&s;elves va&s;&s;als to England for that province<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W, Malm. p. 74.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CANUTE pa&s;&s;ed four years in peace after this enter|prize,

THAT nobleman knew, that he was univer&s;ally be|lieved

King; and perhaps he thought, by di&s;playing this rage
again&s;t Harold's memory, to ju&s;tify him&s;elf from having
had any participation in his coun&s;els. But prince Ed|ward,
being invited over by the King his half brother<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. 156. W. Malm. p. 76. H. Hunt. p. 365.</NOTE>,
immediately on his appearance, entered an accu&s;ation again&s;t Godwin for the murder of Alfred, and demand|ed
ju&s;tice upon him for that act of barbarity. Godwin,
in order to appea&s;e the King, made him a magnificent
pre&s;ent of a galley with a gilt &s;tern, rowed by four&s;core
men, who wore each of them a gold bracelet on his arm,
weighing &s;ixteen ounces, and was armed and
cloathed in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous manner. Hardicanute,
plea&s;ed with the &s;plendor of this &s;pectacle, quickly for|got
his brother's murder; and on Godwin's &s;wearing
that he was innocent of that crime, he allowed him to
be acquitted<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 77. Hoveden, p. 439. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, P. 39. Sim. Dun, p. 180.</NOTE>.</P>

affections of the nation by his mi&s;conduct; but nothing
appeared more grievous to them, than his renewing the
impo&s;ition of Danegelt, and obliging the nation to pay
a great &s;um of money to the fleet, which brought him over
from Denmark. The di&s;contents went high in many
places; and in Worce&s;ter the populace ro&s;e, and put
to death two of the collectors<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 76.</NOTE>. The King, enraged at

ordered three noblemen, Godwin, duke of We&s;&s;ex, Si|ward,
duke of Northumberland, and Leofric, duke of

<HEAD>EDWARD the Confe&s;&s;or.</HEAD>
<P>THE Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1041.</NOTE> on the death of Hardicanute, &s;aw a
favourable opportunity offered for recovering their
liberty, and for &s;haking off the Dani&s;h yoke, under
which they had &s;o long laboured. Sweyn, King of
Norway, the elde&s;t &s;on of Canute, was ab&s;ent; and
as the two la&s;t Kings had died without i&s;&s;ue, there ap|peared
none of that race, whom the Danes could &s;up|port
as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the throne. Prince Edward was for|tunately
at court on his brother's demi&s;e; and tho' th$
de&s;cendants of Edmond Iron&s;ide were the true heirs of
the Saxon family, yet their ab&s;ence in &s;o remote a coun|try
as Hungary, appeared a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for their
exclu&s;ion to a people like the Engli&s;h, &s;o little accu&s;|tomed
to ob&s;erve a regular order in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
their monarchs. All delays might be dangerous; and
the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion mu&s;t ha&s;tily be embraced; while the
Danes, without concert, without a leader, a&s;toni&s;hed at
the pre&s;ent incident, and anxious only for their per&s;onal
<PB N="171" REF="187">
&s;afety, dared not to oppo&s;e the united voice of the whole
nation.</P>
<P>BUT this concurrence of circum&s;tances in Edward's
favour might have failed of its effect, had his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
been oppo&s;ed by Godwin, who&s;e power, alliances,
and abilities gave him a great influence at all times,
much more in tho&s;e &s;udden emergencies, which always
attend a revolution of government, and which, either
&s;eized or neglected, commonly prove &s;o deci&s;ive. There
were circum&s;tances, which divided men's hope$s and fears
with regard to their expectations of Godwin's conduct.
On the one hand, the credit of that nobleman lay chief|ly
in We&s;&s;ex, which was almo&s;t entirely peopled with
Engli&s;h; and it was therefore pre&s;umed, that he would
&s;econd the wi&s;hes of his people, in re&s;toring the Saxon
line, and in humbling the Danes, from whom he, as
well as they, had rea&s;on to dread, as they had already
felt, the mo&s;t grievous oppre&s;&s;ions. On the other hand,
there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a declared animo&s;ity between Edward
and Godwin, on account of Alfred's murder; of which
the latter had publicly been accu&s;ed by the prince, and
which he might believe &s;o deep an offence, as could ne|ver,
on account of any &s;ub&s;equent merits, be &s;incerely
pardoned. But their common friends here interpo&s;ed;
and repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of their good corre&s;pon|dence,
obliged them to lay a&s;ide all jealou&s;y and ran|cour,
and concur in re&s;toring liberty to their native
country. Godwin only &s;tipulated, that Edward, as a
pledge of his &s;incere reconcilement, &s;hould promi&s;e to
marry his daughter, Editha<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malm, p. 80. H. Hunt. p. 365. Ingulph, p. 62.</NOTE>; and having fortified him|&s;elf
by this alliance, he &s;ummoned at Gillingham a ge|neral
council of the nation, and prepared every mea&s;ure
for &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to Edward. The Engli&s;h
were unanimous and zealous in their re&s;olutions; the
<PB N="172" REF="188">
Danes were divided and di&s;pirited: Any &s;mall oppo&s;i|tion,
which appeared in this a&s;&s;embly, was brow-beaten
and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and Edward was crowned King, with the highe&s;t demon&s;trations of duty and affection<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 80.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE triumph of the Engli&s;h, upon this &s;ignal and de|ci&s;ive
advantage, was at fir&s;t attended with &s;ome in&s;ult
and violence again&s;t the Danes; but the new King, by
the mildne&s;s of his character, &s;oon reconciled the latter
to his admini&s;tration, and the di&s;tinction between the
two nations gradually di&s;appeared. They were inter|&s;per&s;ed
with the Engli&s;h in mo&s;t of the provinces; they
&s;poke nearly the &s;ame tongue; they differed little in their
manners and laws; the prevalence of dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en|&s;ions
in Denmark, prevented, for a long time, any
powerful inva&s;ion from thence<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">In the year 1046, the Danes made an inva&s;ion from twenty-five &s;hips, the only one we read of during this reign. Chron. Sax. p. 158.

en&s;ued &s;oon after, reduced both nations to equal &s;ub|jection,
there is no farther mention in our hi&s;tories of
any difference between them. The joy, however, of
their pre&s;ent deliverance made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion on the
minds of the Engli&s;h, that they in&s;tituted an annual fe&s;|tival
for celebrating that great event; and it was ob|&s;erved
in &s;ome counties, even to the age of Spellman<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Spellm. Glo&s;&s;ary in verbo <HI>Hocday.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE popularity, which Edward enjoyed on his ac|ce&s;&s;ion,
was not de&s;troyed by the fir&s;t act of his admini|&s;tration,
the re&s;uming all the grants of his immediate
predece&s;&s;ors; an attempt, which is commonly attended
with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. The poverty of
the crown convinced the nation, that this act of vio|lence
was become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and as the lo&s;s
<PB N="173" REF="189">
fell chiefly on the Danes, who had obtained large
grants from the late Kings, their countrymen, on ac|count
of their &s;ervices in &s;ubduing the kingdom, the
Engli&s;h were rather plea&s;ed to &s;ee them reduced to their
primitive poverty. The King's &s;everity al&s;o towards his
mother the Queen-dowager, tho' expo&s;ed to &s;ome more
cen&s;ure, met not with very general di&s;approbation. He
had hitherto lived on very indifferent terms with that
prince&s;s: He accu&s;ed her of neglecting him and his bro|ther
during their adver&s;e fortune<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 237.</NOTE>: He remarked, that
as the &s;uperior qualities of Canute, and his better treat|ment
of her<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 64. 80. Brompton, p. 906.</NOTE>, had made her entirely indifferent to the
memory of Ethelred, &s;he al&s;o gave the preference to her
children of the &s;econd bed, and always regarded Hardi|canute
as her favourite. The &s;ame rea&s;ons had pro|bably
made her unpopular in England; and tho' her be|nefactions
to the monks obtained her the favour of that
order, the nation was not, in general, di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee
her &s;tripped by Edward of immen&s;e trea&s;ures which &s;he
had ama&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 157. W. Malm. p. 80. Hoveden, p. 439. Higden, p. 277.</NOTE>. He confined her, during the remainder
of her life, to a mona&s;tery in Winche&s;ter; but carried
no farther his rigour again&s;t her. The &s;tories of his ac|cu&s;ing
her of a participation in her &s;on, Alfred's mur|der,
and of a criminal corre&s;pondence with the bi&s;hop
of Winche&s;ter, and al&s;o of her ju&s;tifying her&s;elf by tread|ing
unhurt with her bare feet over nine burning plow|&s;hares,
were the inventions of the monki&s;h hi&s;torians,
and were propagated and believed from the &s;illy wonder
of po&s;terity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 277.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h flattered them&s;elves, that, by the ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of Edward, they were delivered for ever from
the dominion of foreigners; but they &s;oon found, that
that evil was not yet entirely removed. The King had
<PB N="174" REF="190">
been educated in Normandy; and had contracted many
intimacies with the natives of that country, as well as
an affection to their manners<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ingulph, p. 62.</NOTE>. The court of England
was &s;oon filled with Normans, who being di&s;tingui&s;hed,
both by the favour of Edward, and by a degree of culti|vation
&s;omewhat &s;uperior to that of the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e
ages, &s;oon rendered their language, cu&s;toms and laws
fa&s;hionable in the kingdom. The &s;tudy of the French
tongue became general among the people. The courti|ers
affected to imitate that nation in their dre&s;s, equi|page,
and entertainments: Even the lawyers employed a foreign language in their deeds and papers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ingulph, p. 62.</NOTE>: But above
all, the church felt the influence and dominion of the&s;e
&s;trangers: Ulf and William, two Normans, who had
formerly been the King's chaplains, were created bi|&s;hops
of Dorche&s;ter and London. Robert was promoted
to the &s;ee of Canterbury<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 161.</NOTE> and always enjoyed the high|e&s;t
favour of his ma&s;ter, of which his abilities rendered
him not unworthy. And tho' the King's prudence or
his want of authority, made him confer almo&s;t all the
civil and military employments on the natives, the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
preferments fell often to the &s;hare of the Nor|mans;
and as the latter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Edward's confidence,
they had &s;ecretly a great influence on public affairs, and
excited the jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h, particularly of earl
Godwin<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 80.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS powerful nobleman, be&s;ides being duke or earl
of We&s;&s;ex, had, annexed to his government, the coun|ties
of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex. His elde&s;t &s;on, Swayn, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
the &s;ame authority in the counties of Oxford, Berks,
Gloce&s;ter and Hereford: And Harold, his &s;econd &s;on,

of E&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 441. Higden, p. 279. Sim. Dun. p. 184.</NOTE>. The exorbitant authority of his family was
&s;upported by immen&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and powerful allian|ces;
and the abilitirs, as well as ambition, of Godwin
him&s;elf contributed to render it &s;till more dangerous. A
prince of greater capacity and vigour than Edward would
have found it difficult to &s;upport the dignity of the crown
under &s;uch circum&s;tances; and as the haughty temper of
Godwin made him often forget the re&s;pect, due to his
prince, Edward's animo&s;ity again&s;t him was grounded
on per&s;onal as well as political con&s;iderations, on recent
as well as more antient injuries. The King, in pur|&s;uance
of his engagements, had indeed married Editha,
the daughter of Godwin<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 157.</NOTE>; but this alliance became ra|ther
the &s;ource of enmity between them. Edward's
hatred of the father was transferred to that prince&s;s;
and Editha, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many amiable accompli&s;h|ments,
never could acquire the confidence and affection
of her hu&s;band. It is even pretended, that, during the
whole cour&s;e of her life, he ab&s;tained from all commerce
of love with her; and &s;uch was the ab&s;urd admiration,
paid to an inviolable cha&s;tity, during tho&s;e ages, that
his conduct in this particular is highly celebrated by the

He hurried immediately to court; complained of the
u&s;age he had met with; the King entered zealou&s;ly into
the quarrel, and re&s;ented that a &s;tranger of &s;uch di&s;|tinction,

the in&s;olence and animo&s;ity of his people. He gave
orders to Godwin, in who&s;e government Dover lay, to
go immediately to the place, and to puni&s;h the inhabi|tants
for the crime: But Godwin, who de&s;ired rather
to encourage, than repre&s;s, the popular di&s;content again&s;t
foreigners, refu&s;ed obedience, and endeavoured to throw
the whole blame on the count of Boulogne, and his re|tinue<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 163. W. Malm. p. 81. Higden, p. 179.</NOTE>.
Edward, touched in &s;o &s;en&s;ible a point, &s;aw
the nece&s;&s;ity of exerting the royal authority; and he
threatened Godwin, if he per&s;i&s;ted in his di&s;obedience,
to make him feel the utmo&s;t effects of his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>THE earl, perceiving a rupture to be unavoidable,
and plea&s;ed to embark in a cau&s;e, where he was likely
to be &s;upported by his countrymen, prepared for his
own defence, or rather for an attack on Edward; and
under pretence of repre&s;&s;ing &s;ome di&s;orders on the Wel&s;h

then applied for protection to Siward, duke of Nor|thumberland,
and Leofric, duke of Mercia, two power|ful
noblemen, who&s;e jealou&s;y of Godwin's greatne&s;s, as
well as their duty to the crown, engaged them to de|fend
the King in this extremity. They ha&s;tened to him
with &s;uch of their followers as they could a&s;&s;emble on
the &s;udden; and finding the danger &s;till greater than
they had apprehended, they i&s;&s;ued orders for mu&s;tering all
the forces within their government, and for marching
them without delay to the defence of the King's per&s;on
and authority<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 441. Sim. Dun. p. 184.</NOTE>. Edward, meanwhile, endeavoured to
protract time by negotiation; while Godwin, who
thought the King entirely in his power, and who was
willing to &s;ave appearances, fell into the &s;nare; and not
&s;en&s;ible, that he ought to have no farther re&s;erve after
he had proceeded &s;o far, he lo&s;t the favourable oppor|tunity
of rendering him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the government.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h, tho' they had not a very high idea of
Edward's vigour and capacity, bore him great affection
on account of his humanity, ju&s;tice, and piety, as well
as of the long race of their native kings, from whom he
was de&s;cended; and they ha&s;tened from all quarters to
defend him from the pre&s;ent danger. His army was
now &s;o con&s;iderable, that he ventured to take the field;
and marching to London, he &s;ummoned a great council
of the kingdom, to judge of the rebellion of Godwin
and his &s;ons. The&s;e noblemen pretended at fir&s;t that
they were willing to &s;tand their trial; but having in vain
endeavoured to make their adherents per&s;i&s;t in rebellion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 441. Sim. Dun. p. 185.</NOTE>,
they offered to come to London, provided they might
receive ho&s;tages for their &s;afety<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 279.</NOTE>; and this propo&s;al being
<PB N="178" REF="194">

their forces, and to have recour&s;e to flight<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 164. W. Malm. p. 81, 82.</NOTE>. Baldwin,
earl of Flanders, gave protection to Godwin and his
three &s;ons, Gurth, Sweyn, and To&s;ti; the latter of
whom had married the daughter of that prince: Harold
and Leofwin, two others of his &s;ons, took &s;helter in

<P>BUT Godwin had fixed his authority on too firm a
ba&s;is, and he was too &s;trongly &s;upported by alliances
both abroad and at home, not to occa&s;ion farther disturb|ances,
and make new efforts for his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment.
The earl of Flanders allowed him to purcha&s;e and hire
&s;hips within his harbours;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1052.</NOTE> and Godwin, having manned
them with his followers, and with free-booters of all
nations, put to &s;ea, and attempted to make a de&s;cent at
Sandwich. The King, informed of his preparations,
had equipped a con&s;iderable fleet, much &s;uperior to that
of the enemy; and the earl ha&s;tily, before their ap|pearance,
made his retreat into the Flemi&s;h harbours<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dun. p. 186.</NOTE>.
The Engli&s;h court, allured by the pre&s;ent &s;ecurity, and
devoid of all vigorous councils, allowed the &s;eamen to
di&s;band, and the fleet to go to decay<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 166.</NOTE>; while Godwin, expecting this event, kept his men in a readine&s;s for ac|tion.
He put to &s;ea immediately, and &s;ailed to the I&s;le
of Wight, where he was joined by Harold with a &s;qua|dron,
which that nobleman had collected in Ireland.
He was now ma&s;ter of the &s;ea; and entering every har|bour
<PB N="179" REF="195">
in the &s;outhern coa&s;t, he &s;eized all the &s;hips<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 166.</NOTE>, and
&s;ummoned his followers in tho&s;e counties, which had &s;o

The King alone &s;eemed re&s;olute to defend him&s;elf to the

many of whom favoured Godwin's preten&s;ions,
made Edward hearken to terms of accommodation;
and the feigned$ humility of the earl, who di&s;claimed all in|tentions
of offering violence to his &s;overeign, and de&s;ired
only to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by a fair and open trial, paved the

&s;ubjection<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">The ingenious author of the article GODWIN, in the Biographia Bri|tannica, has endeavoured to clear the memory of that nobleman, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that all the Engli&s;h annals had been fal&s;ified by the Nor|man hi&s;torians after the conque&s;t. But that this &s;uppo&s;ition has not much foundation, appears hence, that almo&s;t all the&s;e hi&s;torians have given a very good character of his &s;on Harold, whom it was much more the in|tere&s;t of the Norman cau&s;e to blacken.</NOTE>. He was &s;ucceeded in the government of
We&s;&s;ex, Su&s;&s;ex, Kent, and E&s;&s;ex, and in the office of
&s;teward of the hou&s;ehold, a place of great power, by his
&s;on, Harold, who was actuated by an ambition equal to
that of his father, and was &s;uperior to him in addre&s;s,
in in&s;inuation, and in virtue. By a mode&s;t and gentle
demeanour, he acquired the good-will of Edward; at
lea&s;t, &s;oftened that hatred which the prince had &s;o long
borne his family<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 948.</NOTE>; and gaining every day new parti|zans
by his bounty and affability, he proceeded, in a
more &s;ilent, and therefore a more dangerous manner, to
the increa&s;e of his authority. The King, who had not
&s;ufficient vigour directly to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s, knew
of no other expedient than that hazardous one, of rai&s;|ing
him a rival in the family of Leofric, duke of Mer|cia,
who&s;e &s;on, Algar, was inve&s;ted in the government
of Ea&s;t-Anglia, which, before the bani&s;hment of Ha|rold,
had belonged to this latter nobleman. But this
policy, of balancing oppo&s;ite parties, required a more
&s;teady hand to manage it than that of Edward, and na|turally
produced faction, and even civil broils, among
nobles of &s;uch mighty and independant authority. Al|gar
was &s;oon after expelled his government by the in|trigues
and power of Harold<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 169. H. Hunt. p. 366. Hoveden, p. 443. Ingulf, p. 66. Chron. Mailr. p. 158. Higden, p. 281.</NOTE>; but being protected by
Griffith, prince of Wales, who had married his daugh|ter,
as well as by the power of his father, Leofric, he
obliged Harold to &s;ubmit to an accommodation, and was
re-in&s;tated in the government of Ea&s;t-Anglia. This
<PB N="181" REF="197">
peace was not of long continuance: Harold, taking ad|vantage
of Leofric's death, which happened &s;oon after,
expelled Algar anew, and bani&s;hed him the kingdom<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 444.</NOTE>
And tho' that nobleman made a fre&s;h irruption into Ea&s;t-Anglia
with an army of Norwegians, and over-run the
country<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 66. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 44.</NOTE>, his death, a &s;hort time after, freed Harold
from the preten&s;ions of &s;o dangerous a rival. Edward,
his elde&s;t &s;on, was indeed advanced to the government of
Mercia; but the balance, which the King de&s;ired to
e&s;tabli&s;h between the&s;e powerful families, was entirely
lo&s;t, and the influence of Harold entirely preponderated.</P>
<P>THE death of Siward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1055.</NOTE> duke of Northumberland, made
the way &s;till more open to the ambition of that noble|man.
Siward, be&s;ides his other merits, had acquired honour to England, by his &s;ucce&s;sful conduct of the on|ly
foreign enterprize which was undertaken during the
reign of Edward. Duncan, King of Scotland, was a
prince of a very gentle di&s;po&s;ition, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not vi|gour
&s;ufficient to govern a country &s;o turbulent, and &s;o
much infe&s;ted by the intrigues and animo&s;ities of the
great. Macbeth, a powerful nobleman, and nearly al|lied
to the crown, not contented with curbing the King's
authority, carried farther his pe&s;tilent ambition: He put
his &s;overeign to death; chaced Malcolm Kenmure, his
&s;on and heir, into England; and u&s;urped the crown.
Siward, who&s;e daughter was married to Duncan, em|braced,
by Edward's orders, the protection of this di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed
family: He marched an army into Scotland; and
having defeated and killed Macbeth in battle, he re|&s;tored Malcolm to the thronc of his ance&s;tors<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 79. Hoveden, p. 443. Chron. Mailr. p. 158. Buchanan. p. 115. edit. 1715.</NOTE>. This
&s;ervice, added to his former connexions with the royal
family of Scotland, brought great acce&s;&s;ion to the autho|rity
<PB N="182" REF="198">
of Siward in the north; but as he had lo&s;t his elde&s;t
&s;on, O&s;bern, in the action with Macbeth, it proved in
the i&s;&s;ue fatal to his family. His &s;econd &s;on, Walthoef,
appeared, on his father's death, too young to be entru&s;t|ed
with the government of Northumberland; and Ha|rold's
influence obtained that dukedom to his brother,
To&s;ti<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt p. 366.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE are two circum&s;tances related of Siward, which
di&s;cover his high &s;en&s;e of honour and his martial di&s;po&s;i|tion.
When intelligence was brought him of his &s;on
O&s;bern's death, he was incon&s;olable; till he heard,
that the wound was received in the brea&s;t, and that he
had behaved with great gallantry in the action<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 366. Higden, p. 280. Brompton, p. 946.</NOTE> When
he found his own death approaching, he ordered his &s;er|vants
to cloathe him in a complete &s;uit of armour; and
&s;itting erect on the couch, with a &s;pear in his hand, de|clared,
that, in that po&s;ture, the only one worthy of a
warrior, he would patiently await the fatal moment<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 281. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. $3. Diceto, p. 477.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, now worn with cares and infirmities, felt
him&s;elf far advanced in the decline of life; and having
no i&s;&s;ue him&s;elf, began to think of fixing a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to
the kingdom. He &s;ent a deputation into Hungary, to
invite over his nephew, Edward, &s;on to his elder bro|ther,
and the only remaining heir of the Saxon line<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt, p. 366. Hoveden, p. 444. Ingulf, p. 66. Chron. Mailr. p. 158.</NOTE>.
That prince, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown would have
been ea&s;y and undi&s;puted, came over to England with his
children, Edgar, &s;urnamed Atheling, Margaret, and
Christina; but his death, which happened a few days af|ter
his arrival, threw the King into new difficulties.
He &s;aw, that the great power and ambition of Harold
had tempted him to think of obtaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="183" REF="199">
throne on the fir&s;t vacancy, and that Edgar, on account
of his youth and inexperience, was very unfit to oppo&s;e
the preten&s;ions of &s;o popular and enterpri&s;ing a rival.
The animo&s;ity which he had long borne earl Godwin,
made him aver&s;e to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his &s;on; and he
could not, without extreme reluctance, think of an in|crea&s;e
of grandeur to a family, which had ri&s;en on the
ruins of royal authority, and which, by the murder of
Alfred, his brother, had contributed &s;o much to the
weakening the Saxon line. In this uncertainty, he &s;e|cretly
ca&s;t his eye towards his kin&s;man, William duke
of Normandy, as the only per&s;on who&s;e power, and cha|racter,
and capacity, could &s;upport any de&s;tination which
he might make to the exclu&s;ion of Harold, and his fa|mily<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 68.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS famous prince was natural &s;on of Robert, duke
of Normandy, by Hariotta, daughter of a tanner in Fa|lai&s;e<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 910.</NOTE>,
and was very early e&s;tabli&s;hed in that grandeur,
from which his birth &s;eemed to have &s;et him at &s;o great a
di&s;tance. While he was but nine years of age, his fa|ther
had re&s;olved to undertake a pilgrimage to Jeru&s;a|lem;
a fa&s;hionable act of devotion, which had taken
place of the pilgrimages to Rome, and which, as it was
attended with more difficulty and danger, and carried
the&s;e religious adventurers to the fir&s;t &s;ources of Chri&s;tia|nity,
appeared to them much more pious and meritori|ous.
Before his departure, he a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of the
dutchy; and informing them of his purpo&s;e, he en|gaged
them to &s;wear allegiance to his natural &s;on, Wil|liam,
whom, as he had no legitimate i&s;&s;ue, he intended,
in ca&s;e he &s;hould die in the pilgrimage, to leave &s;ucce&s;|&s;or
to his dominions<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 95.</NOTE> As he was a prudent prince, he
could not but fore&s;ee the great inconveniencies which
<PB N="184" REF="200">
mu&s;t attend his journey, and this &s;ettlement of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion;
ari&s;ing from the natural turbulency of the great,
the claims from other branches of the ducal family, and
the power of the French monarch: But all the&s;e views
were &s;uper&s;eded by the prevailing zeal for pilgrimages<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;tr. p. 452.</NOTE>;
and probably, the more important they were, the more
would Robert exult in &s;acrificing them to what he ima|gined
to be his religious duty.</P>
<P>THIS prince, as he had apprehended, died in his pil|grimage;
and the minority of his &s;on was attended with
all tho&s;e inconveniencies, which were unavoidable in his
&s;ituation. The licentious nobles, freed from the awe of
&s;overeign authority, broke out into per&s;onal animo&s;ities
again&s;t each other, and made the whole country a &s;cene
of war and deva&s;tation<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 95. Gul. Ge|met. lib. 7. cap. 1.</NOTE>. Roger, count of Toni, and
Alain, count of Britanny, advanced preten&s;ions to the
dominion of the &s;tate; and Henry I. King of France,
thought the opportunity favourable for reducing the
power of a va&s;&s;al, who had at fir&s;t acquired his &s;ettlement
in &s;uch a violent and invidious manner, and who had
long appeared formidable to his &s;overeign<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 97.</NOTE>. The re|gency
e&s;tabli&s;hed by Robert found great difficulties in
&s;upporting the government again&s;t this complication of
dangers; and the young prince, when he came to age,
found him&s;elf reduced to a very low condition. But the
great qualities, which he &s;oon di&s;played in the field and
in the cabinet, gave encouragement to his friends, and
&s;truck a terror into his enemies. He oppo&s;ed himself on
all &s;ides again&s;t his rebellious &s;ubjects, and again&s;t foreign
invaders; and by his valour and conduct prevailed in
every action. He obliged the French King to grant
him peace on rea&s;onable terms; he expelled all pretend|ers
to the &s;overeignty; and he reduced his turbulent ba
<PB N="185" REF="201">
to pay &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority, and to &s;u&s;pend
their mutual animo&s;ities. The natural &s;everity of his
temper appeared in a rigorous admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice;
and having found the happy effects of this plan of govern|ment,
without which the laws in tho&s;e ages became to|tally
impotent, he e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a fixed maxim, that
an inflexible conduct was the fir&s;t duty of a &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE tranquillity which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed in his do|minions
had given William lei&s;ure to pay a vi&s;it to the
King of England during the time of Godwin's bani&s;h|ment;
and he was received in a manner &s;uitable to the
great reputation which he had acquired, to the relation
by which he was connected with Edward, and to the
obligations which that prince had owed to his family<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 442. Ingulf, p. 65. Chron. Mailr. p. 157. Hig|den, p. 279.</NOTE>.
On the return of Godwin, and the expul&s;ion of the
Norman favourites, Robert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury,
had, before his departure, per&s;uaded Edward to think of
adopting William as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; a council, which was
favoured by the King's aver&s;ion to Godwin, his prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
towards the Normans, and his e&s;teem of the
duke. That prelate, therefore, received a commi&s;&s;ion
to inform William of the King's intentions in his fa|vour;
and he was the fir&s;t per&s;on who opened the mind
of the prince to entertain the&s;e ambitious hopes<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 68. Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 31. Order. Vitalis, p. 492.</NOTE>. But
Edward, irre&s;olute and feeble in his purpo&s;e, finding that
the Engli&s;h would more ea&s;ily acquie&s;ce in the re&s;tora|tion
of the Saxon line, had, in the mean while, invited
his brother's de&s;cendants from Hungary, with a view of
having them recognized heirs to the throne<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 93. H. Hunt. p. 366.</NOTE>. The death
of his nephew, and the inexperience and unpromi&s;ing
qualities of young Edgar, made him re&s;ume his former
<PB N="186" REF="202">
intentions in favour of the duke of Normandy; though
his aver&s;ion to hazardous enterprizes engaged him to
po&s;tpone the execution, and even to keep his purpo&s;e &s;e|cret
from all his mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>HAROLD, mean while, proceeded, after a more open
manner, in increa&s;ing his popularity, in e&s;tabli&s;hing his
power, and in preparing the way for his advancement on
the fir&s;t vacancy of the throne; an event which, from the
age and infirmities of the King, appeared not very di&s;tant.
But there was &s;till an ob&s;tacle, which it was requi&s;ite for
him p$eviou&s;ly to overcome. Earl Godwin, when re|&s;tored
to his power and fortune, had given ho&s;tages for
his good behaviour; and among the re&s;t one &s;on and one
grand&s;on, whom Edward, for greater &s;ecurity, had &s;ent
over to be kept in Normandy. Harold, tho' he was not
aware of the duke's being his competitor, was unea&s;y,
that &s;uch near relations &s;hould be detained pri&s;oners in a

in favour of Edgar, retain the&s;e pledges as a check on

therefore, to the King his unfeigned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to royal
authority, his &s;teady duty to his prince, and the little

obedience, to detain any longer tho&s;e ho&s;tages, who had
been required on the fir&s;t compo&s;ing of civil di&s;cords. By
the&s;e topics, enforced by his great power, he extorted

on his journey to Normandy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 449. Brompton, p. 947 Eadmer, lib. I. p. 4. Alur. Beverl. p. 125.</NOTE>. A tempe&s;t drove

Harold found means to convey intelligence of his
condition to the duke of Normandy; and repre&s;ented,
that, while he was proceeding to <HI>his</HI> court, in execution
of a commi&s;&s;ion from the King of England, he had met
with this har&s;h treatment from the mercenary di&s;po&s;ition
of the count of Ponthieu.</P>
<P>WILLIAM was immediately &s;en&s;ible of the importance
of the incident. He fore&s;aw, that, if he could once gain
Harold, either by favours or menaces, his way to the
throne of England would be open, and Edward would
meet with no farther ob&s;tacle in executing the favourable
intentions which he had entertained in his behalf. He
&s;ent, therefore, an amba&s;&s;ador to Guy, in order to de|mand
the liberty of his pri&s;oner; and that nobleman, not
daring to refu&s;e &s;o great a prince, put Harold into the
hands of the Norman amba&s;&s;ador, who conducted him
to Ro&uuml;en<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 93. Hoveden, p. 449. Brompton, p. 947. Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 31.</NOTE>. William received him with every demon|&s;tration
of re&s;pect and friend&s;hip; and after &s;howing him|&s;elf
di&s;po&s;ed to comply with his de&s;ire, in delivering up
the ho&s;tages, he took an opportunity of di&s;clo&s;ing to him
the great &s;ecret, of his preten&s;ions to the crown of Eng|land,
and of the will which Edward intended to make in
his favour. He de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Harold in per|fecting
that de&s;ign; he made profe&s;&s;ions of the utmo&s;t
gratitude in return for &s;o great an obligation; he pro|mi&s;ed
that the pre&s;ent grandeur of Harold's family, which
&s;upported it&s;elf with difficulty under the jealou&s;y and ha|tred
of Edward, &s;hould receive new increa&s;e from a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or,
who would be &s;o &s;en&s;ibly beholden to him for his
advancement. Harold was &s;urprized with this declara|tion
of the duke; but being &s;en&s;ible, that he could ne|ver
recover his own liberty, much le&s;s that of his brother
and nephew, if he refu&s;ed the demand, he feigned a

crown for him&s;elf, and profe&s;&s;ed his &s;incere intention of
&s;upporting the will of Edward, and &s;econding the preten|&s;ions
of the duke of Normandy. William, to tie him
fa&s;ter to his &s;ervice, be&s;ides offering him his daughter in
marriage<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 93. H. Hunt. p. 366. Hoveden, p. 449. In|gulf,

fulfil his promi&s;es; and in order to render that oath more
binding, he employed an artifice, well &s;uited to the ig|norance
and &s;uper&s;tition of the age. He &s;ecretly convey|ed
under the altar, on which Harold agreed to &s;wear, the
reliques of &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pected martyrs; and
when Harold had taken the oath, he &s;howed him the re|liques,

which had been ratified by &s;o tremendous a

confidence by the duke of Normandy.</P>
<P>WHEN Harold found him&s;elf at liberty, his ambition
&s;ugge&s;ted ca&s;ui&s;try &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify to him the violation
of an oath, which had been extorted from him by fear,
and which, if fulfilled, might be attended with the &s;ub|jection
of his native country to a foreign power. He
continued &s;till to practi&s;e every art of popularity; to in|crea&s;e
the number of his partizans; to reconcile the
minds of the Engli&s;h to the idea of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; to re|vive
their hatred of the Normans; and by an o&s;tentation
of his power and influence, to deter the timorous Ed|ward
from executing his intended de&s;tination in favour of
William. Fortune, about this time, threw two inci|dents
in his way, by which he was enabled to acquire
<PB N="189" REF="205">
general favour, and to increa&s;e the character, which he
had already obtained, of virtue and capacity.</P>
<P>THE Wel&s;h, tho' a le&s;s formidable enemy than the
Danes, had been long accu&s;tomed to infe&s;t the we&s;tern
borders; and after committing &s;poil on the low coun|tries,
they u&s;ually made a ha&s;ty retreat into their moun|tains,
where they were &s;heltered from the pur&s;uit of their
enemies, and were ready to &s;eize the fir&s;t favourable op|portunity
of renewing their depredations. Griffith, their
pre&s;ent prince, had much di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in th&s;e
incur&s;ions; and his name had become &s;o terrible to the
Engli&s;h, that Harold found he could do nothing more
acceptable to the public, and more honourable to him|&s;elf,
than the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;o dangerous an enemy. He
formed the plan of an expedition again&s;t Wales; and
having prepared &s;ome light-armed foot to pur&s;ue the na|tives
into their fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, &s;ome cavalry to &s;cour the open
country, and a &s;quadron of &s;hips to attack the &s;ea|coa&s;t,
he employed at once all the&s;e forces again&s;t the Wel&s;h,
pro&s;ecuted his advantages with vigour, made no inter|mi&s;&s;ion
in his a&s;&s;aults, and at la&s;t reduced the enemy to
&s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, that, in order to prevent their total de|&s;truction,
they made a &s;acrifice of their prince, who&s;e
head they cut off, and &s;ent to Harold; and they were
contented to receive as their &s;overeigns two Wel&s;h
noblemen appointed by Edward to rule over them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 170. W. Malm. p. 79. H. Hunt. p. 367. Hoveden, p. 446. Ingulf, p. 68. Chron. Mailr. p. 159. Higden, p. 283. Sim. Dun. 192.</NOTE>. The
other incident was no le&s;s honourable to Harold.</P>
<P>TOSTI, the elder brother of this nobleman, had been

tyrannical temper, had practi&s;ed &s;uch cruelty and inju&s;|tice
over the inhabitants, that they ro&s;e in rebellion
again&s;t him, and chaced him from his government.
<PB N="190" REF="206">
Morcar and Edwin, two brothers, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great
power in tho&s;e quarters, and who were grand&s;ons of the
great duke, Leofric, concurred in the in&s;urrection; and
the former, being elected duke, advanced with an army,
to oppo&s;e Harold, who was commi&s;&s;ioned by the King to
reduce and puni&s;h the Northumbrians. Before the
armies came to action, Morcar, well acquainted with
the generous di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h commander, en|deavoured
to ju&s;tify his conduct; and repre&s;ented to him,
that To&s;ti had behaved in a manner unworthy of the &s;ta|tion
to which he was advanced, and no one, not even a
brother, could &s;upport &s;uch tyranny, without participat|ing,
in &s;ome degree, of the infamy attending it; that the
Northumbrians, accu&s;tomed to a legal admini&s;tration,
and regarding it as their birth-right, were willing to &s;ub|mit
to the King, but required a governor who would pay
regard to their rights and privileges; that they had been
taught by their ance&s;tors, that death was preferable to
&s;ervitude, and had come to the field determined to peri&s;h
rather than bear a renewal of tho&s;e indignities, to which
they had been &s;o long expo&s;ed; and they tru&s;ted, that
Harold, on reflection, would not defend in another that
violent conduct, from which, in his own government,
he had always kept at &s;o great a di&s;tance<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 283.</NOTE>. This vigor|ous
remon&s;trance was accompanied with &s;uch a detail of
facts, &s;o well &s;upported, that Harold found it prudent to
abandon his brother's cau&s;e; and returning to Edward,
he per&s;uaded him to pardon the Northumbrians, and to
confirm Morcar in the government<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 171. W. Malm. p. 83. H. Hunt. p. 367. Higden p. 283. Sim. Dun. p. 193.</NOTE>. He even married

<P>BY this marriage, Harold broke all mea&s;ures with the
duke of Normandy; and William clearly perceived, that
he could no longer rely on the oaths and premi&s;es,
which he had extorted from him. But the Engli&s;h
nobleman thought him&s;elf now in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that
it was no longer nece&s;&s;ary for him to di&s;&s;emble. He had
in his conduct again&s;t the Northumbrians, given &s;uch a
&s;pecimen of his moderation as had gained him the affec|tions
of his countrymen. He &s;aw, that almo&s;t all Eng|land
was under the command of him&s;elf or his friends;
while he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the government of We&s;&s;ex, Morcar
that of Northumberland, and Edwin that of Mercia.
He now openly a&s;pired to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and in&s;i&s;ted,
that, &s;ince it was nece&s;&s;ary, by the confe&s;&s;ion of all, to
&s;et a&s;ide the royal family, on account of the imbecility of
Edgar, the &s;ole &s;urviving heir, there was no one &s;o ca|pable
of filling the throne, as a nobleman, of great
power, of mature age, of long experience, of approved
courage and ability, who being a native of the kingdom,
would effectually &s;ecure it again&s;t the dominion and ty|ranny
of foreigners. Edward, broken with age and in|firmities,
&s;aw the difficulties too great for him to encoun|ter
and tho' his inveterate prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions kept him from
&s;econding the preten&s;ions of Harold, he took but feeble
and irre&s;olute &s;teps for &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the duke
of Normandy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><P>The whole &s;tory of the tran&s;actions between Edward, Harold, and the duke of Normandy is told &s;o differently by the antient writers, that there are few important pa&s;&s;ages of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory liable to &s;o great uncertainty. I have followed the account, which appeared to me the moil mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent and probable. It does not &s;eem likely, that Edward ever executed a will in the duke's favour, much le&s;s that he got it ra|tified by the &s;tates of the kingdom, as is affirmed by &s;ome. The will would have been known to all, and would have been produced by the Conqueror, to whom it gave &s;o plau&s;ible, and really &s;o ju&s;t a title; but the doubtful and ambiguous manner in which he &s;eems always to have mentioned it, proves, that he could only plead the known intentions of that monarch in his favour, which he was de&s;irous to call a will. There is indeed a charter of the Conqueror, pre&s;erved by Dr. Hickes, vol. 1. where he calls him&s;elf <HI>rex hereditarius,</HI> meaning heir by will; but a prince, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much power, and attended with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, may employ what pretences he plea&s;es: It is &s;ufficient to re&s;ute his pretences to ob&s;erve, that there is a great diffidence and variation among the hi&s;torians with regard to a point, which, had it been real, mu&s;t have been agreed upon by all of them.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ome hi&s;torians, particularly Malme&s;bury and Matthew We&s;tmin&s;ter, affirm that Harold had no intention of going over to Nor|mandy, but that taking the air in a plea&s;ure-boat on the coa&s;t, he was driven over by &s;tre&s;s of weather to the territories of Guy count of Pon|thieu: But be&s;ides that this &s;tory is not probable in it&s;elf, and is contra|dicted by mo&s;t of the ancient hi&s;torians, it is refuted by a very curious and authentic monument lately di&s;covered. It is a tape&s;try, pre&s;erved in the ducal palace of Ro&uuml;en, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been wrought by orders of Matilda, wi$e to the Emperor: At lea&s;t it is of very great anti|quity. Harold is there repre&s;ented as taking his departure from K. Ed|ward in execution of &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion, and mounting his ve&s;&s;el with a great train. The de&s;ign of redeeming his brother and nephew, who were ho&s;tages, is the mo&s;t likely caufe that can be a&s;&s;igned; and is accordingly mentioned by Eadmer, Hoveden, Brompton, and Simeon of Durham. For a farther account of this piece of tape&s;try, &s;ee Hi&s;toire de I'Academie de Literature, tom. ix. page 535.</P></NOTE>. While he continued in this uncertain|ty,
he was &s;urprized by &s;ickne&s;s, which brought him to
<PB N="192" REF="208">
his grave, on the fifth of January 1066, in the &s;ixty-fifth
year of his age, and twenty-fifth of his reign.</P>
<P>THIS prince, to whom the monks gave the title of
&s;aint and confe&s;&s;or, was the la&s;t of the Saxon line, who
ruled in England; and tho' his reign was peaceable and
fortunate, he owed this pro&s;perity le&s;s to his own ability
than to the conjunctures of the times. The Danes, em|ployed
in other enterprizes, attempted not tho&s;e incur|&s;ions,
<PB N="193" REF="209">
which had been &s;o trouble&s;ome to all his predece&s;|&s;ors,
and fatal to &s;ome of them. The facility of his
di&s;po&s;ition made him acquie&s;ce under the government of
Godwin and his &s;on Harold; and the capacity, as well
as the power of the&s;e noblemen, enabled them, while
they were intru&s;ted with authority, to pre&s;erve dome&s;tic
peace and tranquillity. The mo&s;t commendable circum|&s;tance
of Edward's government was his attention to the
admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and his compiling for that pur|po&s;e
a body of laws, which he collected from the laws
of Ethelbert, Ina, and Alfred. This compilation, tho'
now lo&s;t (for the laws that pa&s;s under Edward's name
were compo&s;ed afterwards<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spelm. in verbo <HI>Balliva.</HI></NOTE>) were long the objects of
affection to the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>EDWARD the Confe&s;&s;or was the fir&s;t who touched for
the King's evil: The opinion of his fanctity procured
belief to this cure among the people; and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,
regarded it as a part of their power and grandeur to up|hold
the &s;ame opinion. It has been continued down to
our time; and the practice was fir&s;t dropped by the pre|&s;ent
royal family, who ob&s;erved, that it could no longer
give amazement even to the populace, and was attended with ridicule in the eyes of all men of under&s;tanding.</P>

came from abroad, and from his own brother,
To&s;ti, who had &s;ubmitted to a voluntary bani&s;hment in
Flanders. Enraged at the &s;ucce&s;sful ambition of Ha|rold,
to which he him&s;elf had fallen a &s;acrifice, he fil|led
the court of Baldwin with complaints of the inju&s;|tice,
which he had &s;uffered: He engaged the intere&s;t of
that family again&s;t his brother: He endeavoured to form
intrigues with &s;ome malcontent nobility of England:
He &s;ent his emi&s;&s;aries to Norway, in order to rouze to
arms the freebooters of that kingdom, and excite their
hopes of reaping advantage from the un&s;ettled &s;tate of
affairs on the u&s;urpation of the new King: And that he
might render the combination more formidable, he made
a journey to Normandy; in expectation, that the duke,
<PB N="195" REF="213">
who had married Matilda, another daughter of Baldwin,
would, in revenge of his own injuries, as well as tho&s;e

<P>THE duke of Normandy, when he fir&s;t received in|telligence

might give the better colour to his preten&s;ions, he &s;ent
over an amba&s;&s;y to England, upbraiding that prince with
his breach of faith, and &s;ummoning him to re&s;ign im|mediately
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom. Harold replied to
the Norman amba&s;&s;dors, that the oath with which he
was reproached, had been extorted by the well grounded
fear of violence, and could never, for that rea&s;on, be
regarded as obligatory: That he had had no commi&s;|&s;ion,
either from the late King or the &s;tates of England,
who alone could di&s;po&s;e of the crown, to make any ten|der
of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the duke of Normandy; and if
he, a private per&s;on, had a&s;&s;umed &s;o much authority,
and had even voluntarily &s;worn to &s;upport the duke's pre|ten&s;ions,
the oath was unlawful, and it was his duty to
&s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of breaking it: That he had
obtained the crown by the unanimous &s;uffrages of the
people; and &s;hould &s;how him&s;elf totally unworthy of
their favour, did he not &s;trenuou&s;ly maintain tho&s;e na|tional
liberties, with which they had entru&s;ted him:
And that the duke, if he made any attempt by force of
arms, &s;hould experience the power of an united nation,
conducted by a prince, who, &s;en&s;ible of the obligations,
impo&s;ed on him by his royal dignity, was determined,
that the &s;ame moment &s;hould put a period to his life and

THIS an&s;wer was no other than William expected;
and he had previou&s;ly fixed his re&s;olution of making an
attempt upon England. Con&s;ulting only his courage,
his re&s;entment, and his ambition, he overlooked all the
difficulties, which mu&s;t attend an attack of a great
kingdom by &s;uch inferior force, and he &s;aw only the
circum&s;tances, which would facilitate his enterprize.
He con&s;idered, that England, ever &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of
Canute, had enjoyed a mo&s;t profound tranquillity, dur|ing
a period of near fifty years; and it would require
time for its &s;oldiers, enervated by long peace, to learn
di&s;cipline, and its generals experience. He knew, that
it was entirely unprovided of fortified towns, by which
it could prolong the war; but mu&s;t venture its whole
fortune in one deci&s;ive action again&s;t a veteran enemy,
who, being once ma&s;ter of the field, would be in a con|dition
to over-run the kingdom. He &s;aw that Harold,
tho' he had given proofs of vigour and bravery, had
newly mounted a throne, which he had acquired by fa|ction,
from which he had excluded a very antient royal
family, and which was likely to totter under him by its
own in&s;tability, much more if &s;haken by any violent ex|ternal
impul&s;e. And he hoped, that the very circum|&s;tance
of his cro&s;&s;ing the &s;eas, quitting his own country,
and leaving him&s;elf no hopes of retreat; as it would
a&s;toni&s;h the enemy by the boldne&s;s of the enterprize,

the mo&s;t wonderful &s;ucce&s;&s;es, in the other extremity of
Europe. A few Norman adventurers in Italy had ac|quired
&s;uch an a&s;cendant, not only over the Italians and
Greeks, but the Germans, and Saracens, that they ex|pelled
the&s;e foreigners, procured to them&s;elves ample
e&s;tabli&s;hments, and laid the foundation of the opulent
kingdom of Naples and Sicily<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 30.</NOTE>. The&s;e enterprizes of
men, who were all of them va&s;&s;als in Normandy, many
of them bani&s;hed for faction and rebellion, excited the
ambition of the haughty William; who di&s;dained, after
&s;uch examples of fortune and valour, to be deterred from
making an attack on a neighbouring country, where he
could be &s;upported by the whole force of his principa|lity.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation al&s;o of Europe in&s;pired William with
hopes, that, be&s;ides his brave Normans, he might em|ploy
again&s;t England the flower of the military force,
which was di&s;per&s;ed in all the other &s;tates. France,
Germany, and the low countries, by the progre&s;s of the
feudal in&s;titutions, were divided and &s;ubdivided into many
&s;mall principalities and baronies; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, en|joying
the civil juri&s;diction within them&s;elves, as well as
the right of arms, acted, in many re&s;pects, as indepen|dent
&s;overeigns, and maintained their properties and pri|vileges,
le&s;s by the authority of laws, than by their own
force and valour. A military &s;pirit had univer&s;ally dif|fu&s;ed
it&s;elf throughout Europe; and the &s;everal leaders,
who&s;e minds were elevated by their princely &s;ituation,
greedily embraced the mo&s;t adventurous enterprizes, and
being accu&s;tomed to nothing from their infancy but re|citals
of the &s;ucce&s;s attending wars and battles, they
were prompted by a natural ambition to imitate tho&s;e
<PB N="198" REF="216">
adventures which they heard &s;o much celebrated, and which
were &s;o much exaggerated by the credulity of the age.
United, however loo&s;ely, by their duty to one &s;uperior
lord, and by their connexions with the great body of
the community, to which they belonged, they de&s;ired to
&s;pread their fame each beyond his own di&s;trict; and in
all a&s;&s;emblies, whether in&s;tituted for civil deliberations,
for military expeditions, or merely for &s;how and enter|tainment,
to out&s;hine each other by the reputation of
&s;trength and prowe&s;s. Hence their genius for chivalry;
hence their impatience for peace and tranquillity; and
hence their readine&s;s to embark in any hazardous
enterprize, however little intere&s;ted in its failure or &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, by his power, his courage, and his abi|lities,
had long maintained a pre-eminence among tho&s;e
haughty chieftains; and every one who de&s;ired to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
him&s;elf by his addre&s;s in military exerci&s;es, or his
valour in action, had been ambitious of acquiring a re|putation
in the court and in the armies of Normandy,
Entertained with that ho&s;pitality and courte&s;y, which
di&s;tingui&s;hed the age, they had formed attachments with
the prince, and greedily attended to the pro&s;pects of glory
and advantage, which he promi&s;ed them in return for
their concurrence in an expedition again&s;t England. The
more grandeur appeared in the attempt, the more it &s;uited
their romantic &s;pirit: The fame of the intended inva&s;ion
was already diffu&s;ed every where: Multitudes crowded
to tender the duke their &s;ervice, with that of their
va&s;&s;als and retainers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictaven&s;is, p. 198.</NOTE>: And William found le&s;s difficulty
in compleating his levies, than in choo&s;ing the mo&s;t ve|teran
and experienced forces, and in rejecting the of|fers
of tho&s;e, who were impatient to acquire fame un|der
&s;o renowned a leader.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="217">
BESIDES the&s;e advantages, which William owed to
his per&s;onal valour and good conduct; he was beholden
to fortune for procuring him &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tances, and for
removing many ob&s;tacles, which it was natural for him to
expect in an undertaking, where all his neighbours were
&s;o deeply intere&s;ted. Conan, duke of Britanny, was his
mortal enemy; and in order to throw a damp upon his
enterprize, he cho&s;e this conjuncture for reviving his
claim to Normandy it&s;elf, and he required, that, in
ca&s;e of William's &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t England, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that dutchy might devolve to him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 33.</NOTE>. But Conan
died &s;uddenly after making this demand; and Howel,
his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in&s;tead of adopting the malignity, or rather
the prudence of his predece&s;&s;or, zealou&s;ly &s;econded the
duke's views, and &s;ent his elde&s;t &s;on, Alian Fergant, to
&s;erve under him with a force of five thou&s;and Britons.
The counts of Anjou, and of Flanders, encouraged
their &s;ubjects to engage in the expedition; and even the
court of France, tho' it might ju&s;tly fear the aggrandize|ment
of &s;o dangerous a va&s;&s;al, pur&s;ued not its intere&s;ts
on this occa&s;ion with &s;ufficient vigour and re&s;olution.
Philip I. the reigning French monarch, was a minor;
and William, having communicated his project to the
council, having de&s;ired a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and offered to do
homage, in ca&s;e of his &s;ucce&s;s, for the crown of Eng|land,
was indeed ordered to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of the
enterprize; but the earl of Flanders, his father-in-law,
being at the head of the regency, favoured under-hand
his levies, and encouraged the enterprizing nobility to
inli&s;t under the &s;tandard of the duke of Normandy.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, Henry IV. be&s;ides giving openly all
his va&s;&s;als permi&s;&s;ion to embark in this expedition, which
&s;o much engaged the attention of Europe, promi&s;ed his
protection to the dutchy of Normandy during the ab&s;ence
<PB N="200" REF="218">
of the prince, and thereby enabled him to draw $his
whole force to the attack of England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 198.</NOTE>. But the mo&s;t
important ally, whom William gained by his negoti|ations,
was the pope, who had a mighty influence over
the antient barons, no le&s;s devout in their religious prin|ciples
than valorous in their military enterprizes. The
Roman pontiff, after an in&s;en&s;ible progre&s;s during &s;everal
ages of darkne&s;s and ignorance, began now to lift his
head openly above all the princes of Europe; to a&s;&s;ume
the office of a mediator, or even an arbiter, in the quar|rels
of the greate&s;t monarchs; to interpo&s;e him&s;elf in all
&s;ecular affairs; and to obtrude his dictates as &s;overeign
laws on his ob&s;equious di&s;ciples. It was a &s;ufficient mo|tive
to Alexander II. the reigning pope, for embracing
William's quarrel, that he alone had made an appeal to
his tribunal, and rendered him umpire of the di&s;pute be|tween
him and Harold; but there were other advanta|ges,
which, that pontiff fore&s;aw, mu&s;t re&s;ult from the
conque&s;t of England by the Norman arms. That king|dom,
tho' at fir&s;t converted by Romi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries, tho'
it had afterwards advanced &s;ome farther &s;teps towards
&s;ubjection under Rome, maintained &s;till a great inde|pendance
in its eccle&s;ia&s;tical admini&s;tration; and form|ing
a world within it&s;elf, entirely &s;eparated from the re&s;t
of Europe, it had hitherto proved inacce&s;&s;ible to tho&s;e
exorbitant claims, which &s;upported the grandeur of the
papacy.
Alexander, therefore, hoped, that the French
and Norman barons, if &s;ucce&s;sful in their enterprize,
might import into that country a more devoted reve|rence
to the holy &s;ee, and bring the Engli&s;h churches to
a nearer conformity with tho&s;e of the re&s;t of Europe.
He declared immediately in favour of William's claim<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100. Ingulf, p. 69. Higden, p. 285. Erompton, p. 958.</NOTE>;
pronounced Harold a perjured u&s;urper; denounced ex|communication
<PB N="201" REF="219">
again&s;t him and his adherents; and the
more to encourage the duke of Normandy in his enter|prize,
he &s;ent him a con&s;ecrated banner, and a ring
with one of St. Peter's hairs in it<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Baker, p. 22. edit. 1684.</NOTE> Thus were all the ambition and violence of that inva&s;ion covered over &s;afely
with the broad mantle of religion.</P>
<P>BUT the greate&s;t difficulty, which William had to en|counter
in his preparations, aro&s;e from his own &s;ubjects
in Normandy. The &s;tates of the dutchy were a&s;&s;em|bled
at Li&s;lebonne; and &s;upplies being demanded for the
intended enterprize, which promi&s;ed &s;o much glory and
advantage to their country, there appeared a reluctance
in many members, both to grant &s;ums &s;o much beyond
the common mea&s;ure of taxes in that age, and to &s;et a
precedent of performing their military &s;ervice out of
their own country. The duke finding it dangerous to
&s;olicit them in a body, conferred &s;eparately with the
riche&s;t per&s;ons in the province; and beginning with
tho&s;e who&s;e affections he mo&s;t relied on, he gradually
engaged all of them to advance the &s;ums demanded.
The count of Longueville &s;econded him in this negoti|ation,
the count of Mortaigne, Odo bi&s;hop of Baieux,
and e&s;pecially William Fitz-O&s;borne, count of Brete&uuml;il,
and con&s;table of the dutchy. Every per&s;on, when he
him&s;elf was once engaged, endeavoured to bring over
others; and at la&s;t the &s;tates them&s;elves, after &s;tipulating
that this conce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be no precedent for the fu|ture,
voted, that they would a&s;&s;i&s;t their prince to the
utmo&s;t in his intended enterprize<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden Introd. ad Britann. p. 212. 2d edit. Gib&s;. Ver&s;tegan, p. 173.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILLIAM had now a&s;&s;embled a fleet of 3000 ve&s;&s;els,
great and &s;mall<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 7. cap. 34.</NOTE>, and had &s;elected an army of 60,000
men from among tho&s;e numerous &s;upplies, which from
<PB N="202" REF="220">
every quarter &s;olicited to be received into his &s;ervice.
The camp bore a &s;plendid, yet a martial appearance,
from the di&s;cipline of the men, the vigor of the hor&s;es,
the lu&s;tre of the arms and accountrements of both; but
above all from the high names of nobility who engaged
under the banners of the duke of Normandy. The mo&s;t
celebrated were Eu&s;tace, count of Boulogne, Aimeri de
Thouars, Hugh d'E&s;taples, William d'Evreux, Geof|frey
de Rotrou, Roger de Beaumont, William de Wa|renne,
Roger de Montgomeri, Hugh de Grantme&s;nil,
Charles Martel, and Geoffrey Giffard<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ordericus Vitalis, p. 501.</NOTE>. To the&s;e bold
chieftains William held up the &s;poils of England as the
prize of their valor; and pointing to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore,
called to them, that <HI>there</HI> was the field, on which they
mu&s;t erect trophies to their name, and fix their e&s;tab|li&s;hments.</P>
<P>WHILE he was making the&s;e mighty preparations, the
duke, that he might increa&s;e the number of Harold's
enemies, excited the inveterate rancour of To&s;ti, and
encouraged him, in concert with Harold Halfager, King
of Norway, to infe&s;t the coa&s;t of England. To&s;ti,
having collected about &s;ixty ve&s;&s;els in the ports of Flan|ders,
put to &s;ea; and after committing &s;ome depreda|tions
on the &s;outh and ea&s;t coa&s;ts, he &s;ailed to Nor|thumberland,
and he was their joined by Halfager, who
came over with a great armament of three hundred &s;ai&s;<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 172. W. Malm. p. 94. H. Hunt, p. 367. Higden, p. 284.</NOTE>.
The combined fleets entered the Humber, and di&s;em|barked
the troops, who began to extend their depreda|tions
on all &s;ides; when Morcar earl of Northumber|land,
and Edwin earl of Mercia, the King's brothers-in-law,
having ha&s;tily collected &s;ome troops, ventured to
<PB N="203" REF="221">
give them battle. The action ended with the total de|feat
and flight of the&s;e two noblemen<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 172. W. Malm. p. 94. Hoveden, p. 448. In|gulf, p 69. Higden, p. 284. Alur. Beverl. p. 123.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAROLD, informed of this misfortune, ha&s;tened with
an army to the protection of his people; and expre&s;&s;ed
the utmo&s;t ardour to &s;how him&s;elf worthy of the crown,
which had been conferred upon him. This prince, tho'
he was not &s;en&s;ible of the full extent of his danger, from
the great combination again&s;t him, had employed every
art of popularity to acquire the affections of the public;
and he gave &s;o many proofs of an equitable and prudent
admini&s;tration, that the Engli&s;h found no rea&s;on to re|pent
of the choice which they had made of a &s;overeign<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W Malm. p. 93. Hoveden, p. 447. Hi&s;t Elien&s;is, cap. 44. Sim. Dun. p. 193. Flor. Wigorn. p. 623.</NOTE>.
They flocked from all quarters to join his &s;tandard; and
as soon as he reached the enemy at Standford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Sep|tember.</NOTE> he found
him&s;elf in a condition of giving them battle. The ac|tion
was very bloody; but the victory was deci&s;ive on
the &s;ide of Harold, and ended with the total rout of the
Danes, together with the death of To&s;ti and Halfager<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 172. W. Malm. p. 94. H. Hunt. p. 368. Ingulf, p. 69. Hi&s;t. Rame&s;. p. 461.</NOTE>.
Even the Dani&s;h fleet fell into the hands of Harold;
who had the genero&s;ity to give prince Olave, the &s;on of
Halfager, his liberty, and allow him to depart with
twenty ve&s;&s;els<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 448. Ingulf, p. 69. Higden, p. 285. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 46.</NOTE>. But he had &s;carce time to rejoice for
this victory, when he received intelligence, that the
duke of Normandy was landed with a great army in the
&s;outh of England.</P>
<P>THE Norman fleet and army had been a&s;&s;embled,
early in the &s;ummer, at the mouth of the &s;mall river
Dive, and all the troops had been in&s;tantly embarked;
but the winds proved long contrary, and detained them
<PB N="204" REF="222">
in that harbour<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 500.</NOTE>. The authority, however, of the duke,
the good di&s;cipline maintained among the &s;eamen and
&s;oldiers, and the great care of &s;upplying them with pro|vi&s;ions,
had prevented any di&s;order; when at la&s;t the
wind became favourable, and enabled them to &s;ail along
the coa&s;t, till they reached St. Valori. There were,
however, &s;everal ve&s;&s;els lo&s;t in this &s;hort pa&s;&s;age; and
as the winds again proved contrary, the army began to
imagine, that heaven had declared again&s;t them, and
that, notwith&s;tanding the Pope's benediction, they were
de&s;tined to certain ruin<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100.</NOTE>. The&s;e bold warriors, who
de&s;pi&s;ed real dangers, were very &s;ubject to the dread
of imaginary ones; and many of them began to muti|ny,
and &s;ome of them even to de&s;ert their colours; when
the duke, in order to &s;upport their drooping hopes, or|dered
a proce&s;&s;ion to be made with the reliques of St.
Valori<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 285. Order. Vitalis, p. 500. Matth. Paris, edit. pari&s;is anno 1644. p. 2.</NOTE>, and prayers to be &s;aid for more favourable
weather. The winds in&s;tantly changed; and as this in|cident
happened on the eve of the fea&s;t of St. Michael,
the tutelar fain$ $ormandy, the &s;oldiers, fancying
they &s;aw the han$ $eaven in all the&s;e concurring cir|cum&s;tances,
&s;et $word$ with the greate&s;t alacrity<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100.</NOTE>: They
met with no oppo&s;ition on their voyage: A great fleet,
which Harold had a&s;&s;embled, and which had cruized all
&s;ummer off the I&s;le of Wight, had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, on
his receiving fal&s;e intelligence, that William, di&s;courag|ed
by the contrary winds and other accidents, had laid
a&s;ide his preparations<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 448. Sim. Dun. p. 194. Diceto, p. 479.</NOTE>. The Norman armament, pro|ceeding
in great order, arrived, without any material
lo&s;s, at Peven&s;ey in Su&s;&s;ex; and the army quietly di&s;|embarked.
The duke him&s;elf, as he leaped on &s;hore,
<PB N="205" REF="223">
happened to &s;tumble and fall; but had the pre&s;ence of
mind to turn the omen to his advantage, by calling
aloud, that he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Baker, p. 22.</NOTE>.
And a &s;oldier, running to a neighbouring cottage, pluck|ed
&s;ome thatch, which, as if giving him &s;eizine of the
kingdom, he pre&s;ented to his general. The joy and
alacrity of William and his whole army was &s;o great,
that they were no wi&s;e di&s;couraged, even when they
heard of Harold's great victory over the Danes; and
they &s;eemed rather to wait with impatience for the ar|rival
of the enemy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 199.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE victory of Harold, tho' great and honourable,
had proved in the main prejudicial to his intere&s;ts, and
may be regarded as the immediate cau&s;e of his ruin. He
lo&s;t many of his brave&s;t officers and &s;oldiers in the ac|tion;
and he di&s;gu&s;ted the re&s;t, by refu&s;ing to di&s;tribute
the Dani&s;h &s;poils among them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 94. Higden, p. 285.</NOTE>: A conduct which was
little agreeable to his u&s;ual genero&s;ity of temper; but
which his de&s;ire of &s;paring the people, in the war which
impended over him from the duke of Normandy, had
probably occa&s;ioned. He ha&s;tened by quick marches to
reach this new invader; but tho' he was reinforced at
London and other places with fre&s;h troops, he found
him&s;elf al&s;o weakened by the de&s;ertion of his old &s;oldi|ers,
who from fatigue and di&s;content &s;ecretly withdrew
from their colours. His brother Gurth, a man of bra|very
and conduct, began to entertain apprehen&s;ions of
the event; and remon&s;trated with the King, that it
would be better policy to prolong the war, or, at lea&s;t,
to &s;pare his own per&s;on in the action. He urged to him,
that the de&s;perate &s;ituation of the duke of Normandy
made it requi&s;ite for that prince to bring matters to a
&s;peedy deci&s;ion, and put his whole fortune on the i&s;&s;ue
<PB N="206" REF="224">
of a battle; but that the King of England, in his own
country, beloved by his &s;ubjects, provided of every &s;up|ply,
had more infallible and le&s;s dangerous methods of
en&s;uring to him&s;elf, the victory: That the Norman
troops, elevated on the one hand with the highe&s;t hopes,
and &s;eeing, on the other, no re&s;ource in ca&s;e of a di&s;|comfiture,
would fight to the la&s;t extremity; and being
the flower of all the warriors of the $continent, mu&s;t be
regarded as formidable to the Engli&s;h: That if their fir&s;t
fire and &s;pirit, which is always mo&s;t dangerous, were
allowed to langui&s;h for want of action; if they were
hara&s;&s;ed with &s;mall &s;kirmi&s;hes, &s;traitened in provi&s;ions,
and fatigued with the bad weather and deep roads dur|ing
the winter-&s;ea&s;on, which was approaching, they mu&s;t
fall an ea&s;y and a bloodle&s;s prey to their enemy: That
if a general action was delayed, the Engli&s;h, &s;en&s;ible of
the imminent danger, to which their properties, as well
as liberties, were expo&s;ed from the&s;e rapacious invaders,
would ha&s;ten from all quarters to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
would render his army invincible: That at lea&s;t, if he
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to hazard a battle, he ought not to
expo&s;e his own per&s;on; but re&s;erve, in ca&s;e of di&s;a&s;trous
accidents, &s;ome re&s;ource to the liberty and independence
of the kingdom: And that having once been &s;o unfor|tunate,
as to be con&s;trained to &s;wear, and that upon the
holy reliques, to &s;upport the preten&s;ions of the duke of
Normandy, it were better that another per&s;on &s;hould
command the army, who, not being bound by the&s;e &s;a|cred
ties, might give the &s;oldiers more certain hopes of
a pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue to the quarrel<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100. Higden, p. 286. Order. Vitalis, p. 500. Matth. We&s;t. p. 222.</NOTE></P>
<P>HAROLD was deaf to all the&s;e remon&s;trances; and
being elated with his pa&s;t pro&s;perity, as well as &s;timu|lated
by his native courage, he re&s;olved to give battle in
per&s;on; and for that purpo&s;e, he drew near to the Nor|mans,
<PB N="207" REF="225">
who had removed their camp and fleet to Ha&s;t|ings,
where they fixed their quarters. He was &s;o con|fident
of &s;ucce&s;s, that he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the duke,
promi&s;ing him a &s;um of money, if he would depart the
kingdom without effu&s;ion of blood: But his offer was
rejected with di&s;dain; and William, not to be behind
with his enemy in vaunting, &s;ent him a me&s;&s;age by &s;ome
monks, requiring him either to re&s;ign the kingdom, or
to hold it of him in fealty, or to &s;ubmit their cau&s;e to
the arbitration of the Pope, or to fight him in &s;ingle
combat<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 100. Higden, p. 286.</NOTE>. Harold replied, that the God of battles would
&s;oon be the arbiter of all their differences<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Higden, p. 286.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h and Normans now prepared them&s;elves
for this important deci&s;ion; but the a&s;pect of things, on
the night before the battle, was very different in the two
camps. The Engli&s;h &s;pent the time in riot, and jollity,
and di&s;order; the Normans in &s;ilence and in prayer, and
in the functions of their religion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 101. De Ge&s;t. Angl. p. 332.</NOTE>. On the morning,
the duke called together the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his
chieftains,
and made them a &s;peech &s;uitable to the occa|&s;ion.
He repre&s;ented to them, that the event which
they and he had long wi&s;hed for, was approaching; and
the whole fortune of the war now depended on their

A&s;&s;er, a contemporary writer, informs us, that Alfred de|po&s;ed all the ignorant aldermen, and appointed men of more capacity in their place: Yet the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, &sect; 355 &s;ay expre&s;ly, that the heretoghs or dukes, and the &s;heriffs, were cho&s;en by the freeholders in the folkmote, a county court, which was a&s;&s;embled once a|year, and where all the freeholders &s;wore allegiance to the King.</NOTE>.

acts of public admini&s;tration. The preambles to all the

conqueror, put this matter beyond controver&s;y, and car|ry
proofs every where of a limited and legal government.
But who were the con&s;tituent members of this Wittena|gemot
has not been determined with certainty by anti|quarians.
It is agreed, that the bi&s;hops and abbots<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Sometimes abbe&s;&s;es were admitted; at lea&s;t, they often &s;ign the King's charters of grants. Spellm, Glo&s;&s;. in verbo <HI>parliamentum</HI></NOTE>
were an e&s;&s;ential part; and it is al&s;o evident, from the
tenor of the&s;e antient laws, that the Wittenagemot en|acted
&s;tatutes which regulated the eccle&s;ia&s;tical as well as
civil government, and that tho&s;e dangerous principles,
by which the church is totally &s;evered from the &s;tate,
were hitherto unknown to the Anglo-Saxons<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Wilkins pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>. It al&s;o
appears, that the aldermen or governors of counties, who,
after the Dani&s;h times, were often called earls<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It appears from the antient tran&s;lations of the Saxon annals and laws, and from King Alfred's translation of Bede, as well as from all the antient hi&s;torians, that <HI>comes</HI> in Latin, <HI>alderman</HI> in Saxron, and <HI>carl</HI> in Dano-Saxon were quite &s;ynonimous. There is only a clau&s;e of a law of King Athel&s;tan's, (&s;ee Spelm. Conc. p. 406) which has &s;tumbled &s;ome antiquarians, and has made them imagine that an earl was &s;upe|rior to an alderman. The weregild or the price of an earl's blood is there fixed at 15,000 thrim&s;as, equal to that of an archbi&s;hop; whereas that of a bi&s;hop and alderman is only 8000 thrim&s;as. To &s;olve this difficulty we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to Selden's conjecture, (&s;ee his Titles of Honour, chap. 5. p. 603, 604.) that the term of earl was in the age of Athel&s;tan ju&s;t beginning to be of u&s;e in England, and &s;tood at that time for the atheling or prince of the blood, heir to the crown. This he confirms by a law of Canute, &sect; 55. where an atheling and an archbi&s;hop are put upon the &s;ame footing. In another law of the &s;ame Athel&s;tan the weregild of the prince or atheling is &s;aid to be 15,000 thrim&s;as. See Wilkins, p. 71.

<P>THE Saxons, who &s;ubdued Britain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t Saxon govern|ment.</NOTE> as they enjoyed
great liberty in their own country, ob&s;tinately retained
that invaluable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in their new &s;ettlement; and
they imported into this i&s;land the &s;ame principles of in|dependance,
which they had inherited from their ance&s;|tors.
The chieftains (for &s;uch they were more properly
than kings or princes) who commanded them in tho&s;e
military expeditions, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very limited autho|rity;
and as the Saxons exterminated, rather than &s;ub|dued,
the antient inhabitants, they were indeed tran&s;|planted
into a new territory, but pre&s;erved unaltered all
their civil and military in&s;titutions. The language was
pure Saxon; even the names of places, which often re|main
while the tongue entirely changes, were almo&s;t all
affixed by the new conquerors; the manners and cu&s;|toms
were wholly German; and the &s;ame picture of a
fierce and bold liberty, which is drawn by the ma&s;terly
pencil of Tacitus, will apply to the&s;e founders of the
Engli&s;h government. The King, &s;o far from being en|titled
to an arbitrary power, was only con&s;idered as the
fir&s;t among the citizens; his authority depended more on
his per&s;onal qualities than on his &s;tation; he was even
&s;o far on a level with the other inhabitants, that a &s;tated
price was affixed to his head, and a legal fine was levied
from his murderer, which, tho' proportioned to his &s;ta|tion,
and &s;uperior to that paid for the life of a &s;ubject,
was a &s;en&s;ible mark of his &s;ubordination to the commu|nity.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to imagine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Succe&s;&s;ion of the Kings.</NOTE> that an independant people, &s;o
little re&s;trained by laws, and cultivated by &s;cience, would
not be very &s;trict in maintaining a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
their princes. Tho' they paid a great re&s;pect to the
royal family, and a&s;cribed to them an undi&s;puted &s;uperi|ority,
<PB N="214" REF="234">
they either had no rule, or none that was &s;teadily
ob&s;erved, in filling the vacant throne; and pre&s;ent con|venience
in that emergency was more attended to than
general principles. We are not however to &s;uppo&s;e,
that the crown was con&s;idered as altogether elective;
and that a regular plan was traced by the con&s;titution
for &s;upplying, by the &s;uffrages of the people, every va|cancy
made by the decea&s;e of the fir&s;t magi&s;trate. If
any King on his death left a &s;on of an age and capacity
fit for government, the young prince naturally &s;tepped
into the throne: If he was a minor, his uncle, or the
next prince of the blood, was promoted to the govern|ment,
and left the &s;ceptre to his po&s;terity: Any &s;ove|reign,
by taking previous mea&s;ures with the leading men,
had it greatly in his power to appoint his &s;ucce&s;&s;or: All
the&s;e changes, and indeed the ordinary admini&s;tration of
government, required the expre&s;s concurrence, or at
lea&s;t the tacit con&s;ent of the people; but pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
however obtained, went far towards procuring
their obedience, and the idea of any right which was
once excluded, was but feeble and imperfect. This is
&s;o much the ca&s;e in all barbarous monarchies, and oc|curs
&s;o often in the hi&s;tory of the Anglo-Saxons, that
we cannot con&s;i&s;ently entertain any other notion of
their government. The idea of an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
in authority is &s;o natural to men, and is &s;o much forti|fied
by the u&s;ual rule in tran&s;mitting private po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
that it mu&s;t retain a great influence on every &s;ociety,
who do rot exclude it by the refinements of a republi|can
con&s;titution. But as there is a &s;en&s;ible difference
between government and private po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and every
one is not equally qualified for exerci&s;ing the one as for
enjoying the ohter, a people, who are not &s;en&s;ible of the
general advantages attending a fixed rule, are apt to
make great leaps in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and frequently to
pass over the per&s;on, who, had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the requi&s;ite

AMONG that military and turbulent people, &s;o aver&s;e
to commerce and the arts, &s;o little enured to indu&s;try,
ju&s;tice was commonly very ill executed, and great oppre&s;|&s;ion
and violence &s;eem to have prevailed. The&s;e di&s;or|ders
would be increa&s;ed by the exorbitant power of the
ari&s;tocracy; and would, in their turn, contribute to in|crea&s;e
it. Men, not daring to rely on the guardian&s;hip
of the laws, were obliged to devote them&s;elves to the &s;er|vice
of &s;ome chieftain, who&s;e orders they followed even
to the di&s;turbance of the government or the injury of
their fellow-citizens, and who afforded them in return
protection from any in&s;ult or inju&s;tice by &s;trangers.
Hence we find, by the extracts which Dr. Brady has gi|ven
us from Dome&s;day, that almo&s;t all the inhabitants even
of boroughs, had placed them&s;elves in the client&s;hip of &s;ome
particular nobleman, who&s;e patronage they purcha&s;ed by

as their &s;overeign, more than the King him&s;elf, or even

the &s;ociety are to contribute by a certain proportion to
pay his fine: A mark a-piece, if the fine be 700 &s;hillings;
le&s;s if the per&s;on killed be a clown or ceorle; the half of
that &s;um, again, if he be a Wel&s;hman. But where any
of the a&s;&s;ociates kills a man, wilfully and without provo|cation,
he mu&s;t him&s;elf pay the fine. If any of the a&s;|&s;ociates
kills a fellow, in a like criminal manner, be&s;ides
paying the u&s;ual fine to the relations of the decea&s;ed, he
mu&s;t pay eight pounds to the &s;ociety, or renounce the be|nefit
of it: In which ca&s;e they bind them&s;elves, under
the penalty of one pound, never to eat or drink with him,

the northern nations. We may, therefore, conclude,
that the more con&s;iderable proprietors of land were, with|out
any election, con&s;tituent members of the national a&s;|&s;embly;
and there is rea&s;on to think, that forty hydes,
or about four or five thou&s;and acres, was the e&s;tate re|qui&s;ite
for intitling the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to this honourable privi|lege.
There is a pa&s;&s;age of an antient author<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Elien&s;is, cap. 36. 40. This pa&s;&s;age is remarked by Dugdale, (pref. to his Baron. vol. $.) and he draws the &s;ame inference from it.</NOTE> from
which it appears, that a per&s;on of very noble birth, even
one allied to the crown, was not e&s;teemed a <HI>princeps</HI> (the
term u&s;ually employed by antient hi&s;torians when the
Wittenagemot is mentioned) till he had acquired a for|tune
of that extent. Nor need we imagine, that the
public council would become di&s;orderly or confu&s;ed by
admitting &s;o great a multitude. The landed property of
England was probably in few hands during the Saxon
times; at lea&s;t, during the latter part of that period:
And as men had &s;mall ambition of attending the&s;e public
councils, there was no danger of the a&s;&s;embly's becoming
too numerous for the di&s;patch of the little bu&s;ine&s;s, which
was brought before them.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ari&s;to|cracy.</NOTE> whatever we may determine con|cerning
the con&s;tituent members of the Wittenagemot,
in whom the legi&s;lature re&s;ided, the Anglo-Saxon govern|ment,
in the period preceding the Norman conque&s;t,
was become extremely ari&s;tocratical: The royal authori|ty
was very limited; the people, even if admitted to that
a&s;&s;embly, were of little or no weight or con&s;ideration. We
have hints given us in the hi&s;torians of the great power and
riches of particular noblemen: And it could not but hap|pen,
after the abolition of the Heptarchy, when the King
lived at a di&s;tance from the provinces, that the&s;e great
proprietors, who re&s;ided on their e&s;tates, would much
augment their authority over their va&s;&s;als and retainers,
<PB N="220" REF="240">
and over all the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Hence
the immea&s;urable power a&s;&s;umed by Harold, Godwin
Leofric, Siward, Morcar, Edwin, Edric and Alfric, who
controlled the authority of the Kings, and rendered them|&s;elves
quite nece&s;&s;ary in the government. The two lat|ter,
tho' dete&s;ted by the people, on account of their
joining a foreign enemy, &s;till pre&s;erved their power and
influence; and we may therefore conclude, that their
authority was founded, not on popularity, but on family
rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. There is one Athel&s;tan, men|tioned
in the reign of the king of that name, who is cal|led
alderman of all England, and is &s;aid to be half-king;
tho' the monarch him&s;elf was a prince of great valour
and ability<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Rame&s;. &sect; 3. p. 387.</NOTE>. And we find, that in the latter Saxon
times, and in the&s;e alone, the great offices went from

the families<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Roger Hoveden, giving the rea&s;on why William the Conqueror made Co&s;patric earl of Northumberland, &s;ays, <HI>Nam ex materno &s;anguine attinebat ad eum honor illius comitatus.

<P>THE circum&s;tances attending the inva&s;ions of the

the principal nobility. The&s;e free-booters made unex|pected

that each county &s;hould re&s;i&s;t them by its own force, and

branch of the Wittenagemot; but who <HI>the&s;e</HI> were
is not &s;o clearly a&s;certained by the laws or the hi&s;tory of
that period. The matter would probably be of difficult
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, even were it examined impartially; but as
our parties have cho&s;en to divide on this head, the que&s;|tion
has been di&s;puted with the greater acrimony, and
the arguments on both &s;ides have become, on that ac|count,
the more captious and deceitful. Our monar|chical

low &s;tate of commerce, were &s;o &s;mall and poor, and the
inhabitants lived in &s;uch dependance on the great men<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Brady's treati&s;e of Engli&s;h boroughs,, p. 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</NOTE>,
that it &s;eems nowi&s;e probable they would be admitted as
a part of the national councils. The commons are well
known to have had no &s;hare in the governments e&s;tab|li&s;hed
by the Franks, Burgundians, and other northern
nations; and we may conclude, that the Saxons, who
remained longer barbarous and uncivilized than the&s;e
tribes, would never think of conferring &s;uch an extraor|dinary
privilege on trade and indu&s;try. The military
profe&s;&s;ion alone was honourable among all tho&s;e con|querors:
The warriors &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in
<PB N="218" REF="242">
land: They became con&s;iderable by their influence over
their va&s;&s;als, retainers, tenants, and &s;laves: And it had
need of &s;trong proofs to convince as that they would ad|mit
any of a rank &s;o much inferior as the burge&s;&s;es, to
&s;hare with them in the legi&s;lative authority. Tacitus in|deed
affirms, that, among the antient Germans, the con|&s;ent
of all the members of the community was required
in every important deliberation; but he &s;peaks not of re|pre&s;entatives;
and this antient practice, mentioned by the
Roman hi&s;torians, could only have place in &s;mall tribes,
where every citizen might without inconvenience be
a&s;&s;embled upon any extraordinary emergency. After
principalities became more exten&s;ive; after the differences
of property bad formed di&s;tinctions more important than
tho&s;e ari&s;ing from per&s;onal &s;trength and valour; we may
conclude, that the national a&s;&s;emblies mu&s;t have been
more limited in their number, and compo&s;ed only of the
more con&s;iderable citizens.</P>
<P>BUT tho' we mu&s;t exclude the burge&s;&s;es or commons
from the Saxon Wittenagemot; there is &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity
for &s;uppo&s;ing, that this a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ted of other mem|bers
be&s;ides the prelates, abbots, aldermen, and the jud|ges
or privy council. For as all the&s;e, excepting &s;ome of
the eccle&s;ia&s;tics<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There is &s;ome rea&s;on to think, that the bi&s;hops were &s;ometimes cho&s;en by the Wittenagemot, and confirmed by the King. Eddius cap. 2.

This de&s;tination was af|terwards frequently violated; and the abbots as well as bi&s;hops were af|terwards all appointed by the court; as we learn from Ingulf, a writer contemporary to the conque&s;t.</NOTE>, were antiently appointed by the King,
had there been no other legi&s;lative authority, the royal
power had been in a great mea&s;ure de&s;potic, contrary to
the tenor of all the hi&s;torians, and to the practice of all
<PB N="223" REF="243">
other, and the fine, which they engage to pay for that of|fence,
is a mea&s;ure of honey.</P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, but a confederacy of this
kind mu&s;t have been a great &s;ource of friend&s;hip and at|tachment,
when men lived in perpetual danger from ene|mies,
robbers and oppre&s;&s;ors, and received protection
chiefly from their per&s;onal valour, and from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of their friends or patrons. As animo&s;ities were then
more violent, connexions were al&s;o more intimate, whe|ther
voluntary or derived from blood: The mo&s;t remote
degree of propinquity was regarded: An indelible memo|ry
of benefits was pre&s;erved: Severe vengeance was ta|ken
of injuries, both from a point of honour, and as the
be&s;t means of future &s;ecurity: And the civil union being
weak, many private confederacies were entered into to
&s;upply its place, and to procure men that &s;afety, which
the laws and their own innocence were not alone able to
in&s;ure them.</P>
<P>ON the whole, notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming liberty or
rather licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Anglo-Saxons, the great bo|dy
of the people, in the&s;e ages, really enjoyed much le&s;s
true liberty, than where the execution of the laws is the
mo&s;t &s;evere, and where &s;ubjects are reduced to the &s;trict|e&s;t
&s;ubordination and dependance on the civil magi&s;trate.
The rea&s;on is derived from the exce&s;s it&s;elf of that liber|ty.
Men mu&s;t guard them&s;elves at any price again&s;t in|sults
and injuries; and where they receive not protection
from the laws and magi&s;trate, they will &s;eek it by &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to &s;uperiors, and by herding in &s;ome inferior con|federacy,
which acts under the direction of a powerful
chieftain. And thus all anarchy is the immediate cau&s;e
of tyranny, if not over the &s;tate, at lea&s;t over many of
the individuals.</P>
<P>THE German Saxons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;eve|ral orders of men.</NOTE> as the other nations of that
continent, were divided into three ranks of men, the
<PB N="224" REF="244">
noble, the free, and the &s;laves<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Nithard. hi&s;t. lib. 4.</NOTE>. This di&s;tinction they
brought over with them into Britain.</P>
<P>THE nobles were called thanes; and were of two
kinds, the King's thanes and le&s;&s;er thanes. The latter
&s;eem to have been dependant on the former; and to have
received lands, for which they paid rent, &s;ervices, or at|tendance
in peace, and war<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Feuds and Tenures, p. 40.</NOTE>. We know of no other title,
which rai&s;ed any one to the rank of thane, except noble
birth and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land. The former was always
much regarded by all the German nations even in their
mo&s;t barbarous &s;tate; and as the Saxon nobility had few
expen&s;ive plea&s;ures to di&s;&s;ipate their fortune, and the com|mons
little trade or indu&s;try by which they could accumu|late
riches, the&s;e two ranks of men, even tho' they were
not &s;eparated by po&s;itive laws, might remain long di&s;tinct,
and the noble families continue many ages in opulence
and &s;plendor. There were no middle rank of men, who
could mix gradually with their &s;uperiors, and procure to
them&s;elves in&s;en&s;ibly honour and di&s;tinction. If by any
extraordinary accident, a mean per&s;on acquired riches,
a circum&s;tance &s;o &s;ingular made him be known and re|marked;
he became the object of envy, as well as indig|nation,
to all the nobles; he would have great difficulty
to defend what he had acquired; and he would find it
impo&s;&s;ible to protect him&s;elf from oppre&s;&s;ion, except by
courting the patronage of &s;ome great chieftain, and pay|ing
a large price for his &s;afety.</P>
<P>THERE are two &s;tatutes among the Saxon laws, which
&s;eem calculated to confound the&s;e different ranks of men;
that of Athel&s;tan, by which a merchant, who had made
three long &s;ea voyages on his own account, was intitled
to the quality of thane<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 71.</NOTE>; and that of the &s;ame prince, by
<PB N="225" REF="245">
which a ceorle or, hu&s;bandman, who had been able to
purcha&s;e five hydes of land, and had a chapel, a kitchen,
a hall and bell, was rai&s;ed to the &s;ame di&s;tinction<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Selden Titles of honour, p. 515. Wilkins, p. 70.</NOTE>. But
the opportunities were &s;o few, by which a merchant or
ceorle could thus exalt him&s;elf above his rank, that the
law could never overcome the reigning prejudices; the
di&s;tinction between noble and ba&s;e blood would &s;till be
indelible; and the well-born thanes would entertain the
highe&s;t contempt for tho&s;e legal and factitious ones. Tho'
we are not informed of any of the&s;e circum&s;tances by an|tient
hi&s;torians, they are &s;o much founded on the nature
of things, that we may admit them as a nece&s;&s;ary and in|fallible
con&s;equence of the &s;ituation of the kingdom du|ring
tho&s;e ages.</P>

great di&s;tinction between the Anglo-Saxon nobility and
the French or Norman, was that the latter built magnifi|cent
and &s;tately ca&s;tles; whereas the former con&s;umed their
immen&s;e fortunes on riot and ho&s;pitality in mean hou&s;es.
<PB N="226" REF="246">
We may thence infer, that the arts in general were much
le&s;s advanced in England than in France; a greater num|ber
of idle &s;ervants and retainers lived about the great fa|milies;
and as the&s;e, even in France, were powerful
enough to di&s;turb the execution of the laws, we may
judge of the authority, acquired by the ari&s;tocracy in
England. When earl Godwin be&s;ieged the Confe&s;&s;or in
London, he &s;ummoned together from all parts his hu&s;|carles,
or hou&s;eceorles and retainers, and obliged his &s;o|vereign
to accept of the conditions, which he was plea&s;ed
to impo&s;e upon him.</P>
<P>THE lower rank of freemen were denominated ceorles
among the Anglo-Saxons; and where they were indu&s;tri|ous,
they were chiefly employed in hu&s;bandry: Whence
a ceorle, and a hu&s;bandman, became in a manner &s;yno|nimous
terms. They cultivated the farms of the nobili|ty
or thanes, for which they paid rent; and they &s;eem
to have been removeable at plea&s;ure. For there is little
mention of lea&s;es among the Anglo-Saxons: The pride
of the nobility, together with the general ignorance of
writing, mu&s;t have rendered the&s;e contracts very rare,
and mu&s;t have kept the hu&s;bandmen in a very dependant
condition. The rents of farms were then chiefly paid in
kind<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, &sect; 70. The&s;e laws fixed the rents for a hyde; but it is difficult to convert it into modern mea&s;ures.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t numerous rank by far in the community
&s;eems to have been the &s;laves or villains, who were the
property of their lords, and were con&s;equently incapable,
them&s;elves, of all property. Dr. Brady a&s;&s;ures us, from
a &s;urvey of Dome&s;day-book<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">General preface to his hi&s;t, p. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c.</NOTE>, that, in all the counties
of England, the far greater part of the land was occu|pied
by them, and that the hu&s;bandmen, and &s;till more
the &s;ocmen, who were tenants, that could not be removed
<PB N="227" REF="247">
at plea&s;ure, were very few in, compari&s;on. This was
not the ca&s;e with the German nations, as far as we can
collect from the account given, us by Tacitus. The
perpetual wars in the heptarchy, and the depredations of
the Danes, &s;eem to have been the cau&s;e of this, great al|teration
with the Anglo-Saxons. The pri&s;oners taken in
battle, or carried off in the frequent inroads, were redu|ced
to &s;lavery; and became, by right of war<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">LL. Edg. &sect; 14. apud Spellm. Conc. vol. i. p. 471.</NOTE>, entirely
at the di&s;po&s;al of their lords. Great property in the nobles,
e&s;pecially if joined to an irregular, admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice,
naturally favours the power of the ari&s;tocracy; but
&s;till more &s;o, if the practice of &s;lavery be admitted, and
has become very common. The nobility not only po&s;|&s;e&s;s
the influence which always attend riches, but al&s;o the
power which the laws give them over their &s;laves and
villains. It becomes then difficult, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible,
for a private man to remain altogether free and indepen|dant.</P>
<P>THERE were two kinds of &s;laves among the Anglo-Saxons;
hou&s;hold &s;laves, after the manner of the anti|ents,
and praedial or ru&s;tic, after the manner of the Ger|mans<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Spellm. Gloff. in verb. Servus.</NOTE>. The&s;e latter re&s;embled the &s;erfs, which are at
pre&s;ent met with in Poland, Denmark, and &s;ome places
in Germany. The power of a ma&s;ter over his &s;laves was
not unlimited among the Anglo-Saxons, as it was among
their ance&s;tors. If a man beat out his &s;lave's eye or
teeth, the &s;lave recovered his liberty<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. &sect; 20.</NOTE>. If he killed him,
he paid a fine to the King; provided the &s;lave died within

<P>BUT tho' the general &s;train of the Anglo-Saxon go|vernment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Courts of ju&s;tice.</NOTE>
&s;eems to have become ari&s;tocratical, there were
&s;till con&s;iderable remains of the antient democracy, which
were not indeed &s;ufficient to protect the lowe&s;t of the
people, without the patronage of &s;ome great lord, but
might give &s;ecurity, and even &s;ome degree of dignity, to
the gentry or inferior nobility. The admini&s;tration of
ju&s;tice, in particular, by the courts of Decennary, the
Hundred and the County, were well calculated to defend
general liberty, and to re&s;train the exorbitant power of
the nobles. In the county courts or &s;hiremotes, all the
freeholders were a&s;&s;embled twice a-year, and received ap|peals
from the other inferior courts. They there decided
all cau&s;es, eccle&s;ia&s;tical as well as civil; and the bi&s;hop,

The affair was determined in a &s;ummary manner, with|out
much pleading, formality, or delay, by a majority
of voices; and the bi&s;hop and alderman had no further
authority than to keep order among the freeholders, and

this perqui&s;ite formed a con&s;ilderable part of the
profits belonging to his office. The two thirds al&s;o,
which went to the King, made no contemptible, &s;hare of

<P>AS the extreme ignorance of the age made deeds and
writings very rare, the County or Hundred court was
the place where the mo&s;t remarkable civil tran&s;actions
were fini&s;hed, in order to pre&s;erve a memorial of them,
and prevent all future di&s;putes. Here te&s;taments were
promulgated, &s;laves manumitted, bargains of &s;ale con|cluded;
and &s;ometimes, for greater &s;ecurity, the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable of the&s;e deeds were in&s;erted in the blank
leaves of the pari&s;h Bible, which thus became a kind of
regi&s;ter, too &s;acred to be fal&s;ified. It was not unu&s;ual to
add to the deed an imprecation on all &s;uch as &s;hould be
guilty of that crime<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hickes Di&s;&s;ert. Epi&s;t.</NOTE></P>
<P>AMONG a people, who lived in &s;o &s;imple a manner as
the Anglo-Saxons, the judicial power is always of great|er
importance than the legi&s;lative. There were few or
no taxes impo&s;ed by the &s;tates: There were few &s;tatutes
enacted; and the nation was le&s;s governed by laws, than
by cu&s;toms, which admitted a great latitude of interpre|tation.
Tho' it &s;hould, therefore, be allowed, that the
Wittenagemot was altogether compo&s;ed of the principal
<PB N="230" REF="252">
nobility, the county-courts, where all the freeholders
were admitted, and which regulated all the daily occur|rences
of life, formed a very wide ba&s;is for the govern|ment,
and were no contemptible check on the ari&s;tocracy.
But there is another power &s;till more important than ei|ther
the judicial or legi&s;lative; and that is the power of
injuring or &s;erving by immediate force and violence, for
which it is difficult to obtain redre&s;s in courts of ju&s;tice.
In all exten&s;ive governments, where the execution of the
laws is feeble, this power naturally falls into the hands of
the principal nobility; and the degree of it which pre|vails,
cannot be determined &s;o much by the public &s;ta|tutes,
as by &s;mall &s;trokes of hi&s;tory, by particular cu&s;|toms,
and &s;ometimes by the rea&s;on and nature of things.
The highlands of Scotland, have been long entitled by
law to every privilege of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; but it was not
till very lately that the common people could in fact en|joy
the&s;e privileges.</P>
<P>THE powers of all the members of the Anglo-Saxon
government are di&s;puted among hi&s;torians and antiquari|ans;
and the extreme ob&s;curity of the &s;ubject, even tho'
faction had never entered into the que&s;tion, would natu|rally
have begot tho&s;e controver&s;ies. But the great in|fluence
of the lords over their &s;laves and tenants, the
client&s;hip of the burghers, the total want of a middling
rank of men, the total want al&s;o of lawyers who did not
then form a &s;eparate profe&s;&s;ion, the extent of the monar|chy,
the loo&s;e execution of the laws, the continued di&s;|orders
and convul&s;ions of the &s;tate; all the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces
evince, that the Anglo-Saxon government became at
la&s;t extremely ari&s;tocratical; and the events, during the
period immediately preceding the conque&s;t, confirm this
inference or conjecture.</P>
<P>BOTH the puni&s;hments inflicted on crimes by the An|glo-Saxon
courts of judicature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Criminal law.</NOTE> and the methods of proof
<PB N="231" REF="253">
employed in all cau&s;es, appear &s;omewhat &s;ingular, and
are very different from tho&s;e which prevail at pre&s;ent
among all civilized nations.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t conceive, that the antient Germans were very
little removed from the original &s;tate of nature: The &s;o|cial
confederacy among them was more martial than ci|vil:
They had chiefly in view the means of attack or de|fence
again&s;t public enemies, not tho&s;e of protection
again&s;t their fellow-citizens: Their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were &s;o
&s;lender and &s;o equal, that they were not expo&s;ed to great
danger; and the natural bravery of the people made every
man tru&s;t to him&s;elf and to his particular friends for
his defence or vengeance. This defect in the political
union drew much clo&s;er the knot of particular confede|racies:
An in&s;ult upon any man was regarded by all his
relations and a&s;&s;ociates as a common injury: They were
bound by honour, as well as by a &s;en&s;e of general inte|re&s;t,
to revenge his death, or any violence which he had
&s;uffered: They retaliated on the aggre&s;&s;or by like vio|lences;
and if he was protected, as was natural and u&s;u|al,
by his own clan, the quarrel was &s;pread &s;till wider,
and bred endle&s;s di&s;orders in the nation.</P>
<P>THE Fri&s;ians, a tribe of the Germans, had never ad|vanced
beyond this wild and imperfect &s;tate of &s;ociety;
and the right of private revenge &s;till remained among
them unlimited and uncontrouled<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LL. Fri&s;. tit. 2. apud Lindenbrog. p. 491.</NOTE>. But the other Ger|man
nations, in the age of Tacitus, had made one &s;tep
farther towards completing the political or civil union.
Tho' it &s;till continued to be an indi&s;pen&s;ible point of ho|nour
for every clan to revenge the death or injury of their
fellow, the magi&s;trate had acquired a right of interpo&s;ing
in the quarrel, and of accommodating the difference.
He obliged the per&s;on maimed or injured, and the rela|tions
<PB N="232" REF="254">
of one killed, to accept of a pre&s;ent from the aggre&s;|&s;or
and his relations<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">LL. Aethelb. &sect; 23. LL. Aelf. &sect; 27.</NOTE>, as a compen&s;ation for the inju|ry<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Called by the Saxons <HI>moegbota.</HI></NOTE>, and to drop all farther pro&s;ecution of revenge.
That the accommodation of one quarrel might not be
the &s;ource of more, this pre&s;ent was fixed and certain,
according to the rank of the per&s;on killed or injured, and
was commonly paid in cattle, the chief property of tho&s;e
rude and uncultivated nations. A pre&s;ent of this kind
gratified the revenge of the injured clan by the lo&s;s which
the aggre&s;&s;or &s;uffered: It &s;atisfied their pride by the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
which it expre&s;&s;ed: It dimini&s;hed their regret for
the lo&s;s or injury of a kin&s;man by their acqui&s;ition of
new property: And thus general peace was for a moment
re&s;tored to the &s;ociety<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Tacit. de mor. Germ. The author &s;ays, that the price of the composition was fixed; which mu&s;t have been by the laws and the interpo&s;ition of the magi&s;trate.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT when the German nations had been &s;ettled &s;ome
time in the provinces of the Roman empire, they made
&s;till a new &s;tep towards a more cultivated life, and their
criminal ju&s;tice gradually improved and refined it&s;elf.
The magi&s;trate, who&s;e office it was to guard public
peace and to &s;uppre&s;s private animo&s;ities, conceived him|&s;elf
to be injured by every injury done to any of his peo|ple;
and be&s;ides the compen&s;ation to the per&s;on who &s;uf|fered,
or to his clan, he thought him&s;elf entitled to exact
a fine, called the Fridwit, as an atonement for the breach
of peace, and as a reward for the pains which he had ta|ken
in accommodating the quarrel. When this idea,
which is &s;o natural, was once &s;ugge&s;ted, it was readily
received both by magi&s;trate and people. The numerous
fines which were levied, augmented the profits of the
King: And the people were &s;en&s;ible, that he would be
<PB N="233" REF="255">
more vigilant in interpo&s;ing with his good offices, when
he reaped &s;uch immediate advantage by them; and that
injuries would be le&s;s frequent, when, be&s;ides compen&s;a|tion
to the per&s;on injured, they were expo&s;ed to this ad|ditional
penalty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides paying money to the relations of the decea&s;ed and to the King, the murderer was al&s;o obliged to pay the ma&s;ter of a &s;lave or va&s;&s;al a &s;um as a compen&s;ation for his lo&s;s. This was called the man|bote. See Spell. Glo&s;&s;. in verb. Fredam, Manbot.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS &s;hort ab&s;tract contains the hi&s;tory of the criminal
juri&s;prudence of the northern nations for &s;everal centuries.
The &s;tate of England in this particular, during the pe|riod
of the Anglo-Saxons, may be judged of by the col|lection
of antient laws, publi&s;hed by Lambard and Wil|kins.
The chief purport of the&s;e laws is not to prevent
or &s;uppre&s;s entirely private quarrels, which the legi&s;lators
knew to be impo&s;&s;ible, but only to regulate and moderate
them. The laws of Alfred enjoin, that if any one
knows, that his enemy or aggre&s;&s;or, after doing him an
injury, re&s;olves to keep within his own hou&s;e <HI>and his own
lands</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The addition of the&s;e la&s;t words in Italics appears nece&s;&s;ary from what follows in the &s;ame law.</NOTE>,
he &s;hall not fight him, till he require compen&s;a|tion
for the injury. If he be &s;trong enough to be&s;iege
him in his hou&s;e, he may do it for &s;even days without at|tacking
him; and if the aggre&s;&s;or is willing, during that
time, to &s;urrender him&s;elf and his arms, his adver&s;ary
may detain him thirty days, but is afterwards obliged to
re&s;tore him &s;afe to his kindred, <HI>and be contented with the
compen&s;ation.</HI> If the criminal fly to the temple, that &s;an|ctuary
mu&s;t not be violated. Where the a&s;&s;ailant has not
force &s;ufficient to be&s;iege the criminal in his hou&s;e, he
mu&s;t apply to the alderman for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and if the al|derman
refu&s;es aid, the a&s;&s;ailant mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the
King: And he is not allowed to a&s;&s;ault the hou&s;e, till
after a refu&s;al of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from this &s;upreme magi&s;trate.
<PB N="234" REF="256">
If any one meets with his enemy, and is ignorant that he
was re&s;olved to keep within his own lands, he mu&s;t, be|fore
he attacks him, require him to &s;urrender him&s;elf a
pri&s;oner, and deliver up his arms; in which ca&s;e he may
detain him thirty days: But if he refu&s;es to deliver up
his arms, it is then lawful to fight him. A &s;lave may
fight in his ma&s;ter's quarrel: A father may fight in his
&s;on's with any one, except with his ma&s;ter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelfr. &sect; 28. Wilkins, p. 43.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT was enacted by King Ina, that no man &s;hould take
revenge of an injury till he had fir&s;t demanded compen&s;a|tion,
and had been refu&s;ed it<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, &sect; 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>KING Edmond, in the preamble to his laws, mentions
the general di&s;&s;ati&s;faction, occa&s;ioned by the multiplicity
of private feuds and battles; and he e&s;tabli&s;hes &s;everal
expedients to remedy this grievance. He ordains, that
if any one murders another, he may, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
his kindred, pay within a twelvemonth the fine of his
crime; and if they abandon him, he &s;hall alone &s;u&s;tain
the deadly feud or quarrel with the kindred of the mur|dered
per&s;on: His own kindred are free from the feud,
but on condition that they neither conver&s;e with the cri|minal,
nor &s;upply him with meat <HI>or other nece&s;&s;aries:</HI> If
any of them, after renouncing him, receive him into
their hou&s;e, <HI>or give him a&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> they are finable to the
King, and are involved in the feud. If the kindred of
the murdered per&s;on take revenge of any but the criminal
him&s;elf, <HI>after he is abandoned by his kindred,</HI> all their pro|perty
is forfeited, and they are declared to be enemies to the
King and all his friends<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. &sect; 1. Wilkins, p. 73.</NOTE>. It is al&s;o ordained, that the
fine for murder &s;hall never be remitted by the King<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. &sect; 3.</NOTE>, and
that no criminal &s;hall be killed who flies to the church,
or any of the King's towns<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. &sect; 2.</NOTE>; and the King him&s;elf de|clares,
<PB N="235" REF="257">
that his hou&s;e &s;hall give no protection to mur|derers,
till they have &s;atisfied the church by their pe|nance,
and the kindred of the decea&s;ed by making com|pen&s;ation<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. &sect; 4.</NOTE>.
There follows the method appointed for
tran&s;acting this composition<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">LL. Edm. &sect; 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE attempts of Edmond to contract and dimini&s;h
the feuds, were contrary to the antient &s;pirit of the nor|thern
barbarians, and were an advance towards a more
regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. By the Salic law, any
man might, by a public declaration, exempt him&s;elf
from his family quarrels: But then he was con&s;idered by
the law as no longer belonging to the family; and he
was deprived of all right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as a puni&s;hment of
his cowardice<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Tit. 63.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE price of the King's head, or his weregild, as it
was then called, was by law 30,000 thrim&s;as, a &s;pecies
of coin who&s;e value is uncertain. The price of the
prince's head was 15,000 thrim&s;as; that of a bi&s;hop's or
alderman's 8000; a &s;heriff's 4000; a thane's or clergy|man's
2000; a ceorle's 266. The&s;e prices were fixed
by the laws of the Angles. By the Mercian law, the
price of a ceorle's head was 200 &s;hillings; that of a
thane's fix times as much; that of a King's &s;ix times
more<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 71, 72.</NOTE>. By the laws of Kent, the price of the arch|bi&s;hop's
head was higher than that of the King's<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">LL. Elthredi, apud Wilkins, p. 110.</NOTE>. Such
re&s;pect was then paid to the eccle&s;ia&s;tics! It mu&s;t be un|der&s;tood,
that where a per&s;on was unable to pay the fine,
he was put out of the protection of law, and the kindred
of the decea&s;ed had liberty to puni&s;h him as they thought
proper.</P>
<P>SOME antiquarians<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel introduct. vol. i. p. 126. Carte, vol. i. p. 366.</NOTE> have thought, that the&s;e compen&s;a|tions
were only given for man-&s;laughter, not for wilful
<PB N="236" REF="258">
murder: But no &s;uch di&s;tinction appears in the laws;
and it is contradicted by the practice of all the other
barbarous nations<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lindenbrogius, pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>, by that of the antient Germans<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Tac. de mor. Germ.</NOTE>,
and by that curious monument above mentioned of Sax|on
antiquity, pre&s;erved by Hickes. There is indeed a
law of Alfred's, making wilful murder capital<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. &sect; 12. Wilkins, p. 29. It is probable, that by wilful murder Alfred means a treacherous murder, committed by one who has no declared feud with another.</NOTE>; but
this &s;eems only to have been an attempt of that great
legi&s;lator for e&s;tabli&s;hing a better police in the king|dom,
and to have remained without execution. By the
laws of the &s;ame prince, a con&s;piracy again&s;t the life
of the King might be redeemed by a fine<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. &sect; 4. Wilkins, p. 35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE price of all kinds of wounds was likewi&s;e fixed
by the Saxon laws: A wound of an inch long under the
hair was paid with one &s;hilling: One of a like &s;ize on
the face, two &s;hillings: Thirty &s;hillings for the lo&s;s of
an ear; and &s;o forth<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelfr. &sect; 40. See al&s;o LL. Ethelb. &sect; 34, &amp;c.</NOTE>. There &s;eems not to have been
any difference made, according to the dignity of the
per&s;on. By Ethelbert's laws, any one who committed
adultery with his neighbour's wife was obliged to pay
him a fine, and buy him another wife<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">LL. Ethelb. &sect; 32.</NOTE></P>

Germans. They &s;eem to be the nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;s of
criminal juri&s;prudence among every free people, where
the will of the &s;overeign is not implicitly obeyed. We

higher fine on breaches of the peace committed in the
King's court, or before an alderman or bi&s;hop. An

Whatever we may imagine concerning the u&s;ual truth
and &s;incerity of men, who live in a rude and barbarous
&s;tate, there is much more fal&s;ehood, and even perjury,
among them than among civilized nations; and virtue,
which is nothing but a more enlarged and more cul|tivated
rea&s;on, never flouri&s;hes to any degree, nor is
founded on &s;teady principles of honour, except where a
good education becomes general; and men are taught
the pernicious consequences of vice, treachery, and im|morality.
Even &s;uper&s;tition, tho' more prevalent among
ignorant nations, is but a poor &s;upply for the defects of
knowledge and education; and our European ance&s;tors,
who employed every moment the expedient of &s;wearing
on extraordinary cro&s;&s;es and reliques, were le&s;s honour|able
in all engagements than their po&s;terity, who from
experience have omitted tho&s;e ineffectual &s;ecurities. This
general pronene&s;s to perjury was much increa&s;ed by the
u&s;ual want of di&s;cernment in judges, who could not di&s;|cu&s;s
an intricate evidence, and were obliged to number,
not weigh, the te&s;timony of the witne&s;&s;es<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sometimes the laws fixed ea&s;y general rules for weighing the credibility of witne&s;&s;es.

oracle were various. One of them was the deci&s;ion by
the <HI>cro&s;s;</HI> and it was practi&s;ed in this manner. When a
per&s;on was accu&s;ed of any crime, he fir&s;t cleared him&s;elf
by oath, attended by eleven compurgators: He next
took two pieces of wood, one of which was marked with
the &s;ign of the cro&s;s; and wrapping both up in wool,
he placed them on the altar, or on &s;ome celebrated re|lique.
After &s;olemn prayers for the &s;ucce&s;s of the expe|riment,
a prie&s;t, or in his &s;tead &s;ome unexperienced
youth, took up one of the pieces of wood, and if he
happened upon that marked with the figure of the cro&s;s,
the per&s;on was pronounced innocent; if otherwi&s;e,
guilty<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">LL. Fri&s;on. tit. 14. apud Lindenbrogium, p. 496.</NOTE>. This practice, as it aro&s;e from &s;uper&s;tition, was
aboli&s;hed by it in France. The Emperor, Lewis the
Debonnaire, prohibited that method of trial, not becau&s;e
it was uncertain, but left that &s;acred figure, &s;ays he, of
the cro&s;s &s;hould be pro&s;tituted in common di&s;putes and
controver&s;ies<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Du Cange in verb. Crux.</NOTE>.</P>

THE ordeal was another e&s;tabli&s;hed method of trial
among the Anglo-Saxons. It was practi&s;ed either by
boiling water or red-hot iron. The water or iron was
con&s;ecrated by many prayers, ma&s;&s;es, fa&s;tings, and ex|orci&s;ms<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Spellm. in verb. Ordeal. Parker, p. 155. Lindenbrog. p. 1299.</NOTE>;
after which, the per&s;on accu&s;ed either took
up a &s;tone &s;unk into the water<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, &sect; 77.</NOTE> to a certain depth, or
carried the iron a certain di&s;tance; and his hand being
wrapped up, and the covering &s;ealed for three days, if
there appeared on examining it no marks of burning, he
was pronounced innocent; if otherwi&s;e, guilty<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sometimes the per&s;on accu&s;ed walked barefoot over red-hot iron.</NOTE>. The
trial by cold water was different: The per&s;on was thrown
into con&s;ecrated water; if he &s;wam, he was guilty; if
he &s;unk, innocent<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Spellman in verb. Ordealium.</NOTE>. It is difficult for us to conceive,
how any innocent per&s;on could ever e&s;cape by the one
trial, or any criminal be, convicted by the other. But
there was another u&s;age admirably calculated for allow|ing
every criminal to e&s;cape, who had confidence enough
to try it. A con&s;ecrated cake, called a cor&s;ned, was
produced; which if the per&s;on could &s;wallow and dige&s;t,
he was pronounced innocent<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Spellm. in verb. Cor&s;ned. Parker, p. 156. Text. Roffen&s;. p. 33.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE Saxon pound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Value of money.</NOTE> as likewi&s;e tho&s;e coined for &s;ome
centuries after the conque&s;t, were three times the weight
of our pre&s;ent money: There were forty-eight &s;hillings
in their pound, and five-pence in a &s;hilling<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. &sect; 40.</NOTE>; and con|&s;equently
a Saxon &s;hilling was a fifth larger than ours,
and a Saxon penny three times as large<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fleetwood's Chron. Pretio&s;um, p. 27, 28, &amp;c.</NOTE>. As to the
value of money in tho&s;e times, compared to the nece&s;&s;a|ries
of life, there are &s;ome, tho' not very certain means
of computation. A &s;heep by the laws of Athel&s;tan was
e&s;timated at a &s;hilling; that is, fifteen-pence of our
money. The fleece was two-fifths of the value of the
whole &s;heep<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, &sect; 69.</NOTE>; much above its pre&s;ent e&s;timation; of
which the rea&s;on probably was, that the Saxons, like
the antients, were little acquainted with any other
cloathing but that made of wool. Silk and cotton, were
quite unknown: Linen was not much u&s;ed. An ox
was computed at $ix times the value of a &s;heep; a cow
at four<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 66.</NOTE>. If we &s;uppo&s;e, that the cattle in that age,
from the defects of hu&s;bandry, were not &s;o large as they
are at pre&s;ent in England, we may compute that money
was then near ten times of greater value. A hor&s;e was
valued at about thirty-&s;ix &s;hillings of our money, or
thirty Saxon &s;hillings<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 126.</NOTE>; a mare a third le&s;s. A man at
three pounds<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The board-wages of a child the fir&s;t
year was eight &s;hillings, a cow's pa&s;ture in &s;ummer, and
<PB N="243" REF="267">
an ox in winter<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">LL. Inae, &sect; 38.</NOTE>. William of Malme&s;bury mentions it
as a high price that William Rufus gave fifteen marks
for a hor&s;e, or about thirty pounds of our pre&s;ent money<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 121.</NOTE>.
Between the years 900 and 1000, Ednoth bought a hide
of land for about 118 &s;hillings<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Rame&s;. p. 415.</NOTE>. This was a little more
than a &s;hilling an acre, which indeed appears to have been
the u&s;ual price, as we may learn from other ac|counts<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Elien&s;. p. 473.</NOTE>. A palfrey was &s;old for twelve &s;hillings about

time was between &s;even and eight &s;hillings; a cow about
&s;ix &s;hillings<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 126.</NOTE>. Gervas of Tilbury &s;ays, that in Henry
the fir&s;t's time, bread during a day for a hundred men
was rated at three &s;hillings, or a &s;hilling of that age; for
it is thought that &s;oon after the conque&s;t a pound &s;terling
was divided into twenty &s;hillings: A &s;heep was rated at
a &s;hilling, and &s;o of other things in proportion. In
Athel&s;tan's time a ram was valued at a &s;hilling, or four|pence
Saxon<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 56.</NOTE>. The tenants of Shireburn were obliged,
at their choice, to pay either &s;ix-pence or four hens<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Mona&s;t Anglic. vol. 2. p. 528.</NOTE>.
About 1232, the abbot of St. Albans, going on a jour|ney,
hired &s;even hand&s;ome &s;tout hor&s;es; and agreed, if
any of them died on the road, to pay the owner 30
&s;hillings a-piece of our pre&s;ent money<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mat. Paris.</NOTE>. It is to be re|marked,
that in all antient times, corn, being a &s;pecies
of manufactory, bore always a higher price, compared
to cattle, than it does in our times<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fleetwood, p. 83. 94. 96. 98.</NOTE>. The Saxon Chro|nicle
tells us<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P. 157.</NOTE>, that in the reign of Edward the Con|fe&s;&s;or
there was the mo&s;t terrible famine ever known;
in&s;omuch that a quarter of wheat ro&s;e to &s;ixty-pennies,
or about fifteen &s;hillings of our pre&s;ent money. Con|&s;equently
it was as dear as if it now co&s;t &s;even pounds
<PB N="244" REF="268">
ten &s;hillings &s;terling. This much exceeds the great fa|mine
in the end of Queen Elizabeth; when a quarter of
wheat was &s;old for four pounds. Money in this la&s;t
period was nearly of the &s;ame value as in our time.
The&s;e enormous famines are a certain proof of bad hu&s;|bandry.</P>
<P>ON the whole, there are three things to be con&s;ider|ed,
wherever a &s;um of money is mentioned in antient
times. Fir&s;t, the change of denomination, by which a
pound has been reduced to the third part of its antient
weight in &s;ilver. Secondly, the change in value by the
greater plenty of money, which has reduced the &s;ame
weight of &s;ilver to ten times le&s;s value, compared to
commodities; and con&s;equently a pound &s;terling to the
thirtieth part of the antient value. Thirdly, the fewer
people and le&s;s industry, which were then to be found
in every European kingdom. This circum&s;tance made
even the thirtieth part of the &s;um more difficult to levy,
and cau&s;ed any &s;um to have more than thirty times more
weight and influence both abroad and at home, than in
our times; in the &s;ame manner that a &s;um, an hundred
thou&s;and pounds for in&s;tance, is at pre&s;ent more difficult
to levy in a &s;mall &s;tate, &s;uch as Bavaria, and can oper|ate
greater effects on &s;uch a &s;mall community, than on
England. This la&s;t difference is not ea&s;y to be calcu|lated:
But allowing, that England has now above five
times more indu&s;try, and three times more people than
it had at the conque&s;t and for &s;ome reigns after it, we
are, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, to conceive, taking all cir|cum&s;tances
together, every &s;um of money mentioned by
hi&s;torians, as if it were multiplied more than an hundred|fold
above a &s;um of the &s;ame denomination at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IN the Saxon times, land was divided equally among
all the male-children of the decea&s;ed, according to the
cu&s;tom of Gavelkind. Entails were &s;ometimes prac|ti&s;ed
<PB N="245" REF="269">
in tho&s;e times<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">LL. Aelf. &sect; 37. apud Wilkins, p. 43.</NOTE>. Lands were chiefly of two kinds,
bockland, or land held by book or charter, which were
regarded as full property, and de&s;cended to the heirs of
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and folkland, or the land held by the ceor|les
and common people, who were removeable at plea|&s;ure,
and were indeed only tenants during the will of
their lords.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t attempt, which we find in England to &s;e|parate
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical from the civil juri&s;diction, was
that law of Edgar, by which all di&s;putes among the cler|gy
were ordered to be carried before the bi&s;hop<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 83.</NOTE>. The
pennances were then very &s;evere; but as a man could
buy them off by money, or might &s;ub&s;titute others to per|form
them, they lay very ea&s;y upon the rich<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Wilkins, p. 96, 97. Spell. Conc. p. 473.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the manners of the Anglo-Saxons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners.</NOTE>
we can &s;ay little, but that they were in general a rude,
uncultivated people, ignorant of letters, un&s;kilful in the
mechanical arts, untamed to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under law and go|vernment,
addicted to intemperance, riot, and di&s;order.
Their be&s;t quality was their military courage, which yet
was not &s;upported by di&s;cipline of conduct. Their
want of fidelity to the prince, or to any tru&s;t repo&s;ed
in them, appears &s;trongly in the hi&s;tory of their latter
period; and their want of humanity in all their hi&s;tory.
Even the Norman hi&s;torians, notwith&s;tanding the low
&s;tate of the arts in their own country, &s;peak of them as
barbarians, when they mention the inva&s;ion made upon
them by the duke of Normandy. The conque&s;t put the
people in a &s;ituation of receiving &s;lowly from abroad the
rudiments of &s;cience and cultivation, and of correcting
their rough and licentious manners.</P>

<P>NOTHING could exceed the con&s;ternation which<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV.</NOTE>
&s;eized the Engli&s;h, when they received intelli|gence
of the unfortunate battle of Ha&s;tings, the death
of their King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;equen|ces of the battle of Ha&s;tings.</NOTE> the &s;laughter of their principal nobility,
and of their brave&s;t warriors, and the rout and di&s;per|&s;ion
of the remainder. But tho' the lo&s;s, which they had
&s;u&s;tained in that fatal action, was con&s;iderable, it might
ea&s;ily have been repaired by a great nation; where the
people were generally armed, and where there re&s;ided &s;o
many powerful noblemen in every province, who could
have a&s;&s;embled their retainers, and have obliged the duke
of Normandy to divide his army, and probably to wa&s;te
it in a multitude of actions and rencounters. It was
thus, that the kingdom had formerly re&s;i&s;ted, for many
years, its invaders, and had been gradually &s;ubdued,
<PB N="247" REF="271">
by the continued efforts of the Romans, Saxons, and
Danes; and equal difficulties might have been appre|hended
by William in this bold and hazardous enter|prize.
But there were &s;everal vices in the Anglo-Saxon
con&s;titution which rendered it difficult for the Engli&s;h
to defend their liberties in &s;o critical an emergency. The
people had in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t all national pride and
&s;pirit, by their recent and long &s;ubjection to the Danes;
and as Canute had, in the cour&s;e of his admini&s;tration,
much abated the rigors of conque&s;t, and had governed
them equitably by their own laws, they regarded with
the le&s;s terror the ignominy of a foreign yoke, and deem|ed
the inconveniences of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion le&s;s formidable than
tho&s;e of blood&s;hed, war, and re&s;i&s;tance. Their attach|ment
al&s;o to the antient royal family had been much
weakened by their habitude of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Dani&s;h
princes, and by their late election of Harold, or their
acquie&s;cence in his u&s;urpation. And as they had long
been accu&s;tomed to regard Edgar Atheling, the only
heir of the Saxon line, as unfit to govern them even in
times of order and tranquillity; they could entertain
&s;mall hopes of his being able to repair &s;uch great lo&s;&s;es
as they had &s;u&s;tained, or to re&s;i&s;t the victorious arms of
the duke of Normandy.</P>
<P>THAT they might not, however, be altogether want|ing
to them&s;elves in this extreme nece&s;&s;ity, the Engli&s;h
took &s;ome &s;teps towards adju&s;ting their disjointed govern|ment,
and uniting them&s;elves again&s;t the common ene|my.
The two potent earls, Edwin and Morcar, who
had fled to London with the remains of the broken ar|my,
took the lead on this occa&s;ion; and in concert with
Stigand, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
great authority, and of ample revenues, proclaimed
Edgar King, and endeavoured to put the people in a
po&s;ture of defence, and encourage them to re&s;i&s;t the

Norman<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 205. Order. Vitalis, p. 502. Hoveden, p. 449. Knyghton, p. 2343.</NOTE>. But the terror of the late defeat, and the
near neighbourhood of the invaders, increa&s;ed the con|fu&s;ion,
in&s;eparable from great revolutions; and every re|&s;olution
propo&s;ed was ha&s;ty, fluctuating, variable; di&s;|concerted
by fear or faction; ill planned, and wor&s;e ex|ecuted.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, that his enemies might not have lei&s;ure
to recover their con&s;ternation or unite their councils,
immediately put him&s;elf in motion after his victory, and
re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute an enterprize, which nothing but
celerity and vigor could render finally &s;ucce&s;sful. His
fir&s;t attempt was again&s;t Romney, who&s;e inhabitants he
&s;everely puni&s;hed on account of their cruel treatment of
&s;ome Norman &s;eamen and &s;oldiers, who had been car|ried
thither by &s;tre&s;s of weather or by a mi&s;take in their
cour&s;e<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 204.</NOTE>: And fore&s;eeing that his conque&s;t of England
might &s;till be attended with many difficulties and with
much oppo&s;ition, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary, before he
&s;hould advance farther into the country, to make him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of Dover, which would both &s;ecure him a retreat
in ca&s;e of adver&s;e fortune, and afford him a &s;afe land|ing-place
for &s;uch &s;upplies as might be requi&s;ite for a&s;|&s;i&s;ting
him to pu&s;h his advantages. The terror, diffu&s;ed
by his victory at Ha&s;tings, was &s;o great, that the garri|&s;on
of Dover, tho' numerous and well provided of every
thing, immediately capitulated; and as the Normans,
ru&s;hing in to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, ha&s;tily &s;et fire
to &s;ome of the hou&s;es, William, who was de&s;irous to
conciliate the minds of the Engli&s;h by an appearance of
lenity and ju&s;tice, made reparation to the inhabitants for
their lo&s;&s;es<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Norman army, being much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a dy|&s;entery,

the duke, on their recovery, advanced with quick marches
towards London, and by his approach increa&s;ed the con|fu&s;ions,
which were already &s;o prevalent in the Engli&s;h
councils. The eccle&s;ia&s;tics in particular, who&s;e influence
was great over the people, began to declare in his fa|vour;
and as mo&s;t of the bi&s;hops and dignified clergy|men
were even then Frenchmen or Normans, the pope's
bull, by which his enterprize was avowed and con&s;e|crated,
was now openly in&s;i&s;ted on as a rea&s;on for ge|neral
&s;ubmi&s;&s;iion. The &s;uperior learning of the&s;e pre|lates,
by which, during the Confe&s;&s;or's reign, they had
rai&s;ed them&s;elves above the ignorant Saxons, made their
opinions be received with implicit faith; and a young
prince, like Edgar, who&s;e per&s;onal qualities were &s;o
mean, was but ill qualified to re&s;i&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion, which
they made on the minds of the people. A repul&s;e,
which a body of Londoners received from five hundred
Norman hor&s;e, renewed the terror of the great defeat at
Ha&s;tings<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pictav. p. 205. Order. Vital. p. 503.</NOTE>; the ea&s;y &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all the inhabitants of

the burning of Southwark before their eyes made them
dread a like fate to their own city; and no man any
longer entertained thoughts but of immediate &s;afety and
of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. Even the earls, Edwin and Mor|car,
in de&s;pair of making effectual re&s;i&s;tance, retired

confirmed in the honours of earl of Oxford, conferred

and received many into favour, who had carried
arms again&s;t him. He confirmed the liberties and immu|nities
of London and the other cities of England; and ap|peared
de&s;irous of replacing every thing on antient e&s;ta|bli&s;hments.
In his whole admini&s;tration, he bore the
&s;emblance of the lawful prince, not of the conqueror<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 962.</NOTE>;
and the Engli&s;h began to flatter them&s;elves, that they had
changed, not the form of their government, but only the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their &s;overeigns, a matter which gave them
&s;mall concern. And the better to reconcile his new &s;ub|jects
to his authority, he made a progre&s;s thro' &s;ome parts
of England; and be&s;ides a &s;plendid court and maje&s;tic
pre&s;ence, which overawed the people, already &s;truck with
his military fame, the appearance of his clemency and
ju&s;tice gained the approbation of the wi&s;e, who were at|tentive
to the fir&s;t &s;teps of their new &s;overeign<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT amid&s;t this confidence and friendship, which he
expre&s;&s;ed for the Engli&s;h, the King took care to place all
real power in the hands of his Normans, and &s;till to keep
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;word, to which, he was &s;en&s;ible, he had
owed his advancement to &s;overeign authority. He di&s;|armed
the city of London and other places, which ap|peared
mo&s;t warlike and populous<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Baker, p. 24.</NOTE>; and building for|tre&s;&s;es
and citadels in that capital, as well as in Winche|&s;ter,
Hereford, and the cities be&s;t &s;ituated for command|ing
the kingdom, he quartered Norman &s;oldiers in all
of them, and left no where any power able to re&s;i&s;t or
oppo&s;e him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. P. 208. Order. Vital. p. 506. M. We&s;t. p. 225. M. Paris, p. 4.</NOTE>. He be&s;towed the forfeited e&s;tates on the
mo&s;t powerful of his captains, and e&s;tabli&s;hed funds for
the payment of his &s;oldiers<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 208.</NOTE>. And thus, while his civil
admini&s;tration carried the face of a legal magistrate, his
<PB N="255" REF="279">
military in&s;titutions were tho&s;e of a ma&s;ter and tyrant;
at lea&s;t of one, who re&s;erved to him&s;elf, whenever he
plea&s;ed, the power of a&s;&s;uming that character.</P>
<P>By this mixture, however, of vigour and lenity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's re|turn to Normady.</NOTE> he
had &s;o pacified the minds of the Engli&s;h, that he thought
he might &s;afely revi&s;it his native country, and enjoy the
triumph and congratulation of his antient &s;ubjects. He
left the admini&s;tration in the hands of his uterine brother,

joy and advantages of its &s;ucce&s;s. His Engli&s;h courti|ers,
willing to ingratiate them&s;elves with their new &s;o|vereign,
endeavoured to out&s;hine each other in equipages

But tho' every thing bore the face of joy
and fe&s;tivity, and William him&s;elf treated his new cour|tiers
with great appearance of kindne&s;s, it was impo&s;|&s;ible
to prevent altogether the in&s;olence of the Normans;

a revolution as rapid as that which had placed William
on the throne. The hi&s;torian above-mentioned, who is
a panegyri&s;t of his ma&s;ter, throws the blame entirely on
the fickle and mutinous di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h, and
highly celebrates the ju&s;tice and lenity of Odo's and
Fitz O&s;bern's admini&s;tration<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">P. 212.</NOTE>. But other hi&s;torians,
with more probability, impute the cau&s;e chiefly to the
Normans, who, de&s;pi&s;ing a people that had &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ub|mitted
to the yoke, envying their riches, and grudging
the re&s;traints impo&s;ed upon their own rapine, were de|&s;irous
of provoking them to a rebellion, by which they
hoped to acquire new confi&s;cations and forfeitures, and
to &s;atisfy tho&s;e unbounded hopes, which they had formed
in entering on this enterprize<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 507.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="281">
IT is evident, that the chief rea&s;on of this alteration
in the &s;entiments of the Engli&s;h, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the
departure of William, who was alone capable of curbing
the violence of his captains, and of overawing the muti|nies
of the people. Nothing indeed appears more &s;trange,
than that this prince, in le&s;s than three months after the
conque&s;t of a great, warlike, and turbulent nation, &s;hould
ab&s;ent him&s;elf, in order to revi&s;it his own country, which
remained in profound tranquillity, and was not menaced
by any of its neighbours; and &s;hould leave &s;o long his
jealous &s;ubjects at the mercy of an in&s;olent and licentious
army. Were we not a&s;&s;ured of the &s;olidity of his genius,
and the good &s;en&s;e di&s;played in all other circum&s;tances of
his conduct, we might a&s;cribe this mea&s;ure to a vain o&s;|tentation,
which rendered him impatient to di&s;play his
pomp and magnificence among his antient courtiers. It
is therefore more natural to believe, that in &s;o extraor|dinary
a &s;tep, he was guided by a concealed policy; and
that tho' he had thought proper at fir&s;t to allure the peo|ple
to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by the &s;emblance of a legal admini&s;tra|tion,
he found, that he could neither &s;atisfy his rapacious
captains, nor &s;ecure his un&s;table government, without
exerting farther the rights of conque&s;t, and &s;eizing
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Engli&s;h. In order to give a pre|tence
for this violence, he endeavoured, without di&s;co|vering
his intention, to provoke and allure them into
in&s;urrections, which, he thought, could never prove dan|gerous,
while he detained all the principal nobility in
Normandy, while a great and victorious army was quar|tered
in England, and while he him&s;elf was &s;o near to
&s;uppre&s;s any tumult or rebellion. But as no antient wri|ter
has a&s;cribed this tyrannical purpo&s;e to William, it
&s;carce &s;eems allowable, from conjecture alone, to throw
&s;uch an imputation upon him.</P>
<P>BUT whether we are to account for that mea&s;ure from<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their in|&s;urrections.</NOTE>
the King's vanity or from his policy, it was the immedi|ate
<PB N="258" REF="282">
cau&s;e of all the calamities which the Engli&s;h endured
during this and the &s;ub&s;equent reigns, and gave ri&s;e to
tho&s;e mutual jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities between them
and the Normans, which were never appea&s;ed, till a long
tract of time had gradually united the two nations, and
had made them one people. The inhabitants of Kent,
who had fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to the conqueror, were the fir&s;t
who attempted to throw off the yoke; and in confede|racy
with Eu&s;tace, count of Bologne, who had al&s;o been
di&s;gu&s;ted by the Normans, made an attempt, tho' with|out
&s;ucce&s;s, on the garri&s;on of Dover<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 289. Order. Vital. p. 508. Anglia Sacra, vol. i, p. 245.</NOTE>. Edric, the
Fore&s;ter, who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions lay on the banks of the Se|verne,
being provoked at the depredations of &s;ome Nor|man
captains in his neighbourhood, formed an alliance
with Blethyn and Rowallan, two Wel&s;h princes; and
endeavoured, with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to repel force by force<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 450. M. We&s;t. p. 226. Sim. Dunelm. p. 197.</NOTE>.
But tho' the&s;e open ho&s;tilities were not very con&s;iderable,
the di&s;affection was general among the Engli&s;h, who had
become &s;en&s;ible, tho' too late, of their defencele&s;s con|dition,
and began already to experience tho&s;e in&s;ults and
injuries, which a nation mu&s;t always expect, that allows
it&s;elf to be reduced to that de&s;picable &s;ituation. A &s;ecret
con&s;piracy was entered into to perpetrate in one day a ge|neral
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Normans, like that which had
been formerly executed again&s;t the Danes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 289.</NOTE>; and the
quarrel was become &s;o univer&s;al and national, that the
va&s;&s;als of earl Coxo, having de&s;ired him to head them in
an in&s;urrection, and finding him re&s;olute in maintaining
his fidelity to William, put him to death as a traitor to
his country<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Gul. Pict. p. 212. Order. Vital. p. 509.</NOTE>.</P>

THE King, informed of the&s;e dangerous di&s;contents,
ha&s;tened over to England; and by his pre&s;ence, and the

both enabled William to gratify farther the rapacity of his
Norman captains, and gave them the pro&s;pect of new
forfeitures and attainders<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 369. M. We&s;t. p. 225.</NOTE>. The King began to regard

Tho' the natural violence and &s;everity of his temper made

which could give them a rational hope of &s;ucce&s;s

<PB N="260" REF="284">
of Exeter, in&s;tigated by Githa, mother to King
Harold, refu&s;ed to admit a Norman garri&s;on, and betak|ing
them&s;elves to arms, were &s;trengthened by the acce&s;|&s;ion
of the neighbouring inhabitants of Devon&s;hire and
Cornwal<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 510.</NOTE>. The King ha&s;tened with his forces to cha&s;|tize
this revolt; and on his approach, the wi&s;er and more
con&s;iderable citizens, &s;en&s;ible of the unequal conte&s;t, per|&s;uaded
the people to &s;ubmit, and to deliver ho&s;tages for
their obedience. A &s;udden mutiny of the populace broke
this agreement; and William, appearing before the walls,
ordered the eyes of one of the ho&s;tages to be put out, as
an earne&s;t of that &s;everity, which the rebels mu&s;t expect,
if they per&s;evered in their revolt<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The inhabitants
were anew &s;eized with terror, and &s;urrendering at di&s;|cretion,
threw them&s;elves at the King's feet, and entreat|ed
for clemency and forgivene&s;s. William was not de|void
of genero&s;ity, when his temper was not hardened
either by policy or pa&s;&s;ion: He was prevailed on to pardon
the rebels, and he &s;et guards on all the gates, in order to
prevent the rapacity and in&s;olence of his &s;oldiery<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Gi|tha
e&s;caped with her trea&s;ures to Flanders<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 450. Flor. Wigorn. p. 635.</NOTE>. The in&s;ur|gents
of Cornwal imitated the example of Exeter, and
met with like treatment: And the King, having built
a citadel in that city, which he put under the command
of Baldwin, &s;on of earl Gilbert<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 510.</NOTE>, returned to Winche|&s;ter,
and di&s;per&s;ed his army into their quarters. He was
here joined by his wife, Matilda, who had not yet vi&s;it|ed
England, and whom he now ordered to be crowned
by archbi&s;hop Aldred<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Hoveden, p. 450. M. We&s;t. p. 226. Flor. Wigorn. p. 635.</NOTE>. Soon after, &s;he brought him an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
to his family, by the birth of a fourth &s;on, whom he
<PB N="261" REF="285">
named Henry<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 226.</NOTE>. His three elder &s;ons, Robert, Richard,
and William, &s;till re&s;ided in Normandy.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the King appeared thus fortunate both in
public and dome&s;tic life, the di&s;contents of his Engli&s;h
&s;ubjects augmented daily; and the injuries, committed
and &s;uffered on both &s;ides, rendered the quarrel between
them and the Normans ab&s;olutely incurable. The in&s;o|lence
of victorious ma&s;ters, di&s;per&s;ed throughout the king|dom,
&s;eemed intolerable to the natives; and wherever they
found the Normans, &s;eparate or a&s;&s;embled in &s;mall bodies,
they &s;ecretly &s;et upon them, and gratified their vengeance
by the &s;laughter of their enemies<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 225.</NOTE>. But an in&s;urrection
in the north drew thither the general attention, and &s;eemed
to promi&s;e more important con&s;equences. Edwin and
Morcar appeared at the head of this rebellion; and the&s;e
potent noblemen, before they took arms, &s;tipulated for
foreign &s;uccours, from their nephew Blethin, prince of
North-Wales, from Malcolm, King of Scotland, and
from Sweyn, King of Denmark. Be&s;ides the general
di&s;content, which had &s;eized all the Engli&s;h; the two
earls were in&s;tigated to this revolt by private injuries.
William, in order to in&s;ure them to his intere&s;ts, had, on
his acce&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ed his daughter in marriage to Ed|win;
but either he had never &s;eriou&s;ly intended to per|form
this engagement, or having changed his plan of ad|mini&s;tration
in England from clemency to rigour, he
thought it was to little purpo&s;e, if he gained one family,
while he enraged the whole nation. When Edwin,
therefore, renewed his application, he gave him an ab&s;o|lute
refu&s;al<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 511.</NOTE>; and this di&s;appointment, added to &s;o ma|ny
other rea&s;ons of di&s;gu&s;t, induced that nobleman and
his brother to concur with their enraged countrymen,
and to make one effort for the recovery of their antient
<PB N="262" REF="286">
liberties. William knew the importance of celerity in
quelling an in&s;urrection, &s;upported by &s;uch powerful
leaders, and &s;o agreeable to the wi&s;hes of the people;
and having his troops always in readine&s;s, he advanced
by great journies to the north. On his march, he gave
orders to fortify the ca&s;tle of Warwick, of which he left
Henary de Beaumont governor, and that of Nottingham,
which he committed to the cu&s;tody of William Peverell,
another Norman captain<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 511.</NOTE>. He reached York before the
rebels were in any condition for re&s;i&s;tance, or were join|ed
by any of the foreign &s;uccours, which they expected,
except a &s;mall reinforcement from Wales<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and the two
earls found no other means of &s;afety, but having recour&s;e
to the clemency of the victor. Archil, a potent noble|man
in tho&s;e parts, imitated their example, and delivered
his &s;on as a ho&s;tage of his fidelity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; nor were the people,
thus de&s;erted by their leaders, able to make any farther
re&s;i&s;tance. But the treatment, which William gave the
chieftains and their followers, was very different. He ob|&s;erved
religiou&s;ly the terms, which he had granted the
former; and allowed them, for the pre&s;ent, to keep po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their e&s;tates; but he extended the rigors of his
confi&s;cations over the latter, and gave away their lands
to his foreign adventurers, who, being planted thro' the
whole country, and being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the military power,
left Edwin and Morcar, whom he pretended to &s;pare,
de&s;titute of all &s;upport, and ready to fall, whenever he
&s;hould think proper to command their ruin. A peace,
which he made with Malcolm, who did him homage for
Cumberland, &s;eemed, at the &s;ame time, to deprive them
of all pro&s;pect of foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h were now &s;en&s;ible, that their final de|&s;truction
was intended; and that in&s;tead of a &s;overeign,
whom they had at fir&s;t hoped to gain by their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="263" REF="287">
they had tamely &s;urrendered them&s;elves, without re&s;i&s;t|ance,
to a tyrant and a conqueror. Tho' the early con|fi&s;cation
of Harold's followers might &s;eem iniquitous;
being extended towards men who had never &s;worn fidelity
to the duke of Normandy, who were ignorant of his
preten&s;ions, and who only fought in defence of the go|vernment,
which they them&s;elves had e&s;tabli&s;hed in their
own country: Yet were the&s;e rigors, however contrary
to the antient Saxon laws, excu&s;ed on account of the ur|gent
nece&s;&s;ities of the prince; and tho&s;e who were not
involved in the pre&s;ent ruin, hoped, that they would
thenceforth enjoy without mole&s;tation their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
and their dignities. But the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive de&s;truction of &s;o
many other families convinced them, that the King in|tended
to rely entirely on the &s;upport and affections of
foreigners; and they fore&s;aw new forfeitures, attainders,
and violences as the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of this de&s;tructive
plan of admini&s;tration. They ob&s;erved, that no Engli&s;h|man
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his confidence, or was intru&s;ted with any
command or authority; and that the &s;trangers, whom a
rigorous di&s;cipline could have but ill contained, were en|couraged
in every act of in&s;olence and tyranny again&s;t
them. The ea&s;y &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the kingdom on its fir&s;t
inva&s;ion had expo&s;ed the natives to contempt; the &s;ub&s;e|quent
proofs of their animo&s;ity and re&s;entment had made
them the object of hatred; and they were now deprived
of every expedient, by which they could hope to make
them&s;elves either regarded or beloved by their &s;overeign.
Impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;en&s;e of this di&s;mal &s;ituation, many
Engli&s;hmen fled into foreign countries, with an intention
of pa&s;&s;ing their lives abroad free from oppre&s;&s;ion, or of
returning on a favourable opportunity to a&s;&s;i&s;t their friends
in the recovery of their native liberties<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 508. M. We&s;t. p. 225. M. Paris, p. 4. Sim. Dun. p. 197.</NOTE>.

his two &s;i&s;ters, Margaret and Chri&s;tina. They were well

&s;ome others imitated their example: A de&s;ertion which

They landed in Devon&s;hire; but found Brian,
&s;on of the count of Brittany, ready to oppo&s;e them at

of the Normans were now directed to the north, where
affairs had fallen into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. The impa|tient
Northumbrians had attacked Robert de Comyn,

<P>As power naturally follows property,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduc|tion of the feudal law.</NOTE> this revolution

by the new in&s;titutions, which he e&s;tabli&s;hed, took al&s;o
care to retain for ever the military authority in tho&s;e
hands, which had enabled him to &s;ubdue the kingdom.
He introduced into England the feudal law, which he
found e&s;tabli&s;hed in France and Normandy, and which,
during that age, was the foundation both of the &s;tability
and of the di&s;orders in mo&s;t of the monarchical govern|ments

with very few exceptions, except the royal deme&s;nes,
into baronies; and he conferred the&s;e, with the re&s;erva|tion
of &s;tated &s;ervices and payments, on the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable
of his adventurers. The&s;e great barons, who held
immediately of the crown, &s;hared out a great part of their
lands to other foreigners, who were denominated knights
or va&s;&s;als, and who paid their lord the &s;ame duty and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in peace and war, which he him&s;elf owed to
his &s;overeign. The whole kingdom contained about
700 chief tenants, and 60,215 knights-fees<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 523. Secretum Abbatis, apud Selden, Titles of Honour, p. 573. Spellm. Glo&s;&s;. in verbo <HI>Feodum.</HI> Sir Robert Cotton.</NOTE>; and as

glad to be received into the &s;econd, and under the pro|tection

which they had received free from their ance&s;tors<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 225. M. Paris, p. 4. Bracton, lib. 1. cap. II. num. I. Fleta, lib. I. cap. 8. n. 2.</NOTE>. The
&s;mall mixture of Engli&s;h, which entered into this civil
or military fabric, (for it partook of both &s;pecies) was
&s;o re&s;trained by &s;ubordination under the foreigners, that
the Norman dominion &s;eemed now to be fixed on the
mo&s;t durable ba&s;is, and to defy all the efforts of its ene|mies.</P>
<P>THE better to unite the parts of the government, and
to bind them into one &s;y&s;tem, which might &s;erve both
for defence again&s;t foreigners, and for the &s;upport of do|me&s;tic
tranquillity, William reduced the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
revenues under the &s;ame feudal law; and tho' he had
courted the church on his fir&s;t inva&s;ion and acce&s;&s;ion, he
now &s;ubjected it to burthens, which the clergy regarded
as a grievous &s;lavery, and as totally unbefitting their
profe&s;&s;ion. The bi&s;hops and abbots were obliged, when
required, to furni&s;h to the King during war a number
of knights or military tenants, proportioned to the ex|tent of property po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by each &s;ee or abbey; and they
were liable, in ca&s;e of failure, to the &s;ame penalties
which were exacted from the laity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 5. Anglia Sacra, vol. I. p. 248.</NOTE>. The Pope and the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics exclaimed again&s;t this tyranny, as they call|ed
it; but the King's authority was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed
over the army, who held every thing from his bounty,

BUT as the great body of the clergy were &s;till natives,
the King had much rea&s;on to dread the effects of their
re&s;entment; and he therefore u&s;ed the precaution of ex|pelling
the Engli&s;h from all the con&s;iderable dignities,
and of advancing foreigners in their place. The par|tiality
of the Con&s;e&s;&s;or towards the Normans had been
&s;o great, that aided by their &s;uperior learning, it had
promoted them to many of the &s;ees of England; and
even before the period of the conque&s;t, &s;carce more than
&s;ix or &s;even of the prelates were natives of the country.
But among the&s;e was Stigand, archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury;
a man, who, by his addre&s;s and vigour, by the
greatne&s;s of his family and alliances, by the extent of his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as well as by the dignity of his office, and
his authority over the Engli&s;h, gave great jealou&s;y to the
King<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Parker, p. 161.</NOTE>. Tho' William had, on his acce&s;&s;ion, affronted
this prelate, by employing the archbi&s;hop of York to
officiate at his con&s;ecration, he was careful, on other
occa&s;ions, to load him with honours and care&s;&s;es, and to
avoid the giving him farther offence, till the opportunity
&s;hould offer of effectuating his final de&s;truction<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Parker, p. 164. Knyghton, p. 2344.</NOTE>. The
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the late rebellions, and the total &s;ubjection
of the Engli&s;h, made him hope, that an attempt again&s;t
Stigand, however violent, would be covered by his great
&s;ucce&s;&s;es, and be overlooked amid&s;t the other important
revolutions, which affected &s;o deeply the property and
liberty of the kingdom. Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
mighty advantages, he did not think it &s;afe to violate the
reverence u&s;ually paid the primate, but under cover of a
new &s;uper&s;tition, which he was the great in&s;trument of
introducing into England.</P>
<P>THE doctrine which exalted the papacy above all hu|man power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Innovation in ecc$e&s;ia&s;|tical go|vernment.</NOTE> had gradually diffu&s;ed it&s;elf from the city
<PB N="273" REF="301">
and court of Rome; and was, during this age, much
more prevalent in the &s;outhern than in the northern
kingdoms of Europe. Pope Alexander, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted
William in his conque&s;t of England, rea&s;onably ex|pected,
that the French and Normans would import in|to
England, the &s;ame reverence for his &s;acred character,
with which they were imbued in their own country;
and would break the &s;piritual, as well as civil indepen|dancy
of the Saxons, who had hitherto conducted their
eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, with an acknowledgment in|deed
of primacy in the &s;ee of Rome, but without much
idea of its title to dominion or authority. As &s;oon,
therefore, as the Norman prince &s;eemed fully e&s;tabli&s;hed
on the throne, the Pope di&s;patched Ermenfroy, bi&s;hop
of Sion, as his legate into England; and this prelate
was the fir&s;t, who had ever appeared with that charac|ter
in any part of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands. The King, tho'
he was probably led by principle to pay this &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion
to Rome, determined, as is u&s;ual, to employ the
incident as a means of &s;erving his political purpo&s;es, and
of degrading tho&s;e Engli&s;h prelates, who were become
obnoxious to him. The legate &s;ubmitted to become the
in&s;trument of his tyranny; and naturally thought, that
the more violent the exertion of power, the more cer|tainly
did it confirm the authority of that court from
which he derived his commi&s;&s;ion. He &s;ummoned, there|fore,
a council of the prelates and abbots at Winche|&s;ter;
and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two cardinals, Peter and
John, he cited before him Stigand, archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury,
to an&s;wer for his conduct<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Flor. Wi|gorn. p. 636.</NOTE>.
The primate was accu&s;ed of three crimes; the holding the &s;ee of Win|che&s;ter
together with that of Canterbury; the officiating
in the pall of Robert, his predece&s;&s;or; and the having
received his own pall from Benedict IX. who was af|terwards

papacy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 453. Diceto, p. 482. Knyghton, p. 2345. An|glia Sacra, vol. i. p. 5, 6. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 438.</NOTE>. The&s;e crimes of Stigand were mere preten|ces;
&s;ince the fir&s;t had been a practice not unu&s;ual in
England, and was never any where &s;ubjected to a higher
penalty than a re&s;ignation of one of the &s;ees; the &s;e|cond
was a pure ceremonial; and as Benedict was the
only Pope who then officiated, and his acts were never
re&s;cinded, all the prelates of the church, e&s;pecially tho&s;e
who lay at a di&s;tance, were very excu&s;able for making
their applications to him, Stigand's ruin, however, was
re&s;olved on, and was pro&s;ecuted with great &s;everity&punc;
The legate degraded him from his dignity, and the King
confi&s;cated his e&s;tate, and ca&s;t him into pri&s;on, where
he continued, in great poverty and want, during the re|mainder
of his life. Like rigour was exerci&s;ed again&s;t
the other Engli&s;h prelates: Agelric, bi&s;hop of Sele&s;ey,
and Agelmare, of Elmham, were depo&s;ed by the legate,

&s;hould ever be advanced to any dignity, eccle&s;ia&s;tical,
civil, or military<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 70, 71.</NOTE>; and the King therefore, upon Sti|gand's

This prelate was very rigid in defending the prerogatives
of his &s;tation; and after a long proce&s;s before the Pope,
he obliged Thomas, a Norman monk, who had been
appointed to the &s;ee of York, to acknowledge the pri|macy
of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 175, 176. Ingulf, p. 92. M. Paris, p. 6. Diceto, p. 484. Brompton, p. 970, 971, 972. Spelm. Conc. vol. ii. p. 5.</NOTE>. Where am|bition
can be &s;o happy as to cover its attempts, even to
the per&s;on him&s;elf, under the appearance of principle, it
is the mo&s;t incurable and inflexible of all human pa&s;|&s;ions.
Hence Lanfranc's zeal to promote the intere&s;ts of
the papacy, by which he him&s;elf augmented his own au|thority, was indefatigable<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Selden in Fleta, cap. 6.</NOTE>; and met with proportion|able
&s;ucce&s;s. The devoted attachment to Rome conti|nually
increa&s;ed in England; and being favoured by the
&s;entiments of the conquerors, as$well as by the mona&s;|$ic
e&s;tabli&s;hments formerly introduced by Edred, and
&s;ettled by Edgar, it &s;oon reached the &s;ame height, at
which, during &s;ome time, it had &s;tood in France and

Italy<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 228. Lanfranc wrote in defence of the real pre&s;ence again&s;t Berengarius; and in tho&s;e ages of &s;tupidity and ignorance, he was greatly applauded for that performance.</NOTE>. It afterwards went much farther; being fa|voured

ob&s;tructed its progre&s;s; and being le&s;s checked by know|ledge
and a liberal education, which were &s;till &s;ome|what
more common in the &s;outhern countries.</P>
<P>THE prevalence of this &s;uper&s;titious &s;pirit became very
dangerous to &s;ome of William's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and very in|commodious
to mo&s;t of them; but the arbitrary power
of this King over the Engli&s;h, and his exten&s;ive au|thority
over the foreigners, kept him from feeling any
pre&s;ent inconveniencies from it. He retained the church
in great &s;ubjection, as well as his lay &s;ubjects; and would
allow none, of whatever character, to di&s;pute his &s;ove|reign
will and plea&s;ure. He prohibited his &s;ubjects to
acknowledge any one for Pope whom he him&s;elf had not
previou&s;ly received: He required, that all the eccle&s;ia&s;|tical
canons, voted in any &s;ynod, &s;hould fir&s;t be laid be|fore
him, and he ratified by his authority: Even bulls or
letters from Rome, before they were produced, mu&s;t re|ceive
the &s;ame sanction: And none of his mini&s;ters or
barons, whatever offences they were guilty of, mu&s;t be
&s;ubjected to &s;piritual cen&s;ures, till he him&s;elf had given
his con&s;ent to their excommunication<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 6.</NOTE>. The&s;e regula|tions
were worthy of a &s;overeign, and kept united the
civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers, which the principles in|troduced
by this prince had an immediate tendency to &s;eparate.</P>
<P>BUT the Engli&s;h had the cruel mortification to find,
that their King's authority, however acquired or how|ever
extended, was all employed to their oppre&s;&s;ion; and
that the &s;cheme of their &s;ubjection, attended with every

in the French tongue, a practice which was continued
from cu&s;tom till after the reign of Edward III. and was
never indeed totally di&s;continued in England. The
pleadings in the &s;upreme courts of judicature were in
French<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">36 Edw. III. cap. 15. Selden Spicileg. ad Eadmer, p. 189. For|te&s;cue de laud. leg. Angl. cap. 48.</NOTE>: The deeds were often drawn in the &s;ame lan|guage:

foreign dialect. From this attention of William, and
from the great foreign dominions, long annexed to the

French, which is at pre&s;ent to be found in the Engli&s;h
tongue, and which compo&s;es the greate&s;t and be&s;t part
of our language. But amid&s;t the&s;e endeavours to depre&s;s

But the&s;e acts of genero&s;ity towards the leaders were di&s;|graced,
as u&s;ual, by William's rigour again&s;t the infe|rior
malecontents. He ordered the hands to be lopt off,

<P>THE province of Maine in France had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1073.</NOTE> by the will of
Hobert, the la&s;t count, fallen under the dominion of
William &s;ome years before his conque&s;t of England;
but the inhabitants, di&s;&s;atisfied with the Norman govern|ment,
and in&s;tigated by Fulk, count of Anjou, who
had &s;ome preten&s;ions to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, had ri&s;en in re|bellion,
and expelled the magi&s;trates, whom the King
had placed over them. The full &s;ettlement of England
now afforded him lei&s;ure to puni&s;h this in&s;ult on his au|thority;
but being unwilling to remove his Norman
forces from this i&s;land, he carried over a con&s;iderable
army, compo&s;ed almo&s;t entirely of Engli&s;h<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 182.</NOTE>, and after
joining them to &s;ome troops levied in Normandy, he en|tered
the revolted province. The Engli&s;h appeared am|bitious
of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion, and
of recovering that character of valour, which had long
been national among them; but which their late ea&s;y
&s;ubjection under the Normans had &s;omewhat degraded
and ob&s;cured. Perhaps too they hoped, by their zeal
and activity, to recover the confidence of their &s;ove|reign,
as their ance&s;tors had formerly, by like means,
gained the affections of Canute; and to conquer his in|veterate
prejudices in favour of his own countrymen.
The King's military conduct, &s;econded by &s;uch brave
troops, &s;oon overcame all oppo&s;ition in Maine: The in|habitants
were obliged to &s;ubmit, and the count of An|jou
relinqui&s;hed his preten&s;ions.</P>

But during the&s;e tran&s;actions<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|tion of the Norman barons.</NOTE> the government of
England was greatly di&s;turbed; and that too by tho&s;e
very foreigners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1074.</NOTE> who owed every thing to the King's
bounty, and who were the &s;ole object of his friend&s;hip
and regard. The chieftains, who had engaged with the
duke of Normandy in the conque&s;t of England, were en|dowed
with the mo&s;t independant &s;pirit; and tho' they
obeyed their leader in the field, they would have regard|ed
with di&s;dain the riche&s;t acqui&s;itions, had they been
required, in return, to &s;ubmit, in their civil government,
to the arbitrary will of one man. But the imperious
character of William, encouraged by his ab&s;olute domi|nion
over the Engli&s;h, and often impelled by the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of his affairs, had prompted him to &s;tretch his
authority over the Normans them&s;elves, beyond what
the free genius of that victorious people could ea&s;ily bear.
The di&s;contents were become very general among tho&s;e
haughty nobles; and even Roger, earl of Hereford, &s;on
and heir of Fitz-O&s;berne, the King's chief favourite,
was &s;trongly infected by them. This nobleman, in|tending

upon his mind, and de&s;troyed all the &s;atisfaction which
he could reap from his own grandeur and advancement.
When a pro&s;pect, therefore, was opened of retrieving
their liberty, he ha&s;tily embraced it; while the fumes of
the liquor, and the ardour of the company, prevented
him from reflecting on the con&s;equences of that ra&s;h at|tempt.
But after his cool judgment returned, he fore|&s;aw,
that the con&s;piracy of the&s;e di&s;contented barons
was not likely to prove &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed
power of William; or if it did, that the &s;lavery of the

become more grievous, under a multitude of foreign
leaders, factious and ambitious, who&s;e union or di&s;cord
would be equally oppre&s;&s;ive to the people. Tormented
with the&s;e reflections, he opened his mind to his wife,
Judith, of who&s;e fidelity he entertained no &s;u&s;picion,
but who, having &s;ecretly fixed her affections on an|other,
took this opportunity of ruining her ea&s;y and cre|dulous

which, the believed, would tend to enrage him again&s;t

his fir&s;t duty was to his &s;overeign and benefactor, his

aid they placed their chief confidence. The earl of He|reford
was checked by Walter de Lacy, a great baron

All this immen&s;e &s;tore of &s;piritual and civil authority was

of the Emperors, who had hitherto exerci&s;ed the power
of appointing the Pope on every vacancy, or at lea&s;t of
ratifying his election; he undertook the arduous ta&s;k of
disjoining entirely the eccle&s;ia&s;tical from the civil power,
and of excluding profane laymen from the right which
they had a&s;&s;umed, of filling the vacancies of bi&s;hoprics,

people, to whom it originally belonged<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo &s;opra benef. eccle&s;. p. 30.</NOTE>, made great op|po&s;ition
to this claim of the court of Rome; and Hen|ry
IV. the pre&s;ent Emperor, defended the prerogative
of his crown with a vigour and resolution &s;uitable to its
importance. The few offices, either civil or military,
which the feudal institutions left the &s;overeign the power
of be&s;towing, made the prerogative of conferring the
pa&s;toral ring and &s;taff the mo&s;t invaluable jewel of the
royal diadem; e&s;pecially as the general ignorance of the age
bellowed a weight on the eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices, even
beyond the great extent of power and property which be|longed to them. Super&s;tition, the child of ignorance,
inve&s;ted the clergy with an authority almo&s;t &s;acred; and
as they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the little learning of the age, their inter|po&s;ition
became requi&s;ite in all civil bu&s;ine&s;s, and a real
u&s;efulne&s;s in common life was thus &s;uperadded to the &s;pi|ritual
&s;anctity of their character.</P>
<P>WHEN the u&s;urpations, therefore, of the church had
come to &s;uch a maturity as to embolden her to attempt
extorting the right of inve&s;titures from the temporal
power, Europe, e&s;pecially Italy and Germany, was thrown
into the mo&s;t violent convul&s;ions, and the Pope and Em|peror
waged implacable war again&s;t each other. Grego|ry
even dared to fulminate the &s;entence of excommuni|cation
again&s;t Henry and his adherents, to pronounce
him rightfully depo&s;ed, to free his &s;ubjects from their
oaths of allegiance; and, in&s;tead of &s;hocking mankind
with this gro&s;s incroachment on the civil authority, he
found the &s;tupid people ready to &s;econd his mo&s;t exorbi|tant
preten&s;ions. Every mini&s;ter, &s;ervant, or va&s;&s;al of
<PB N="288" REF="318">
the Emperor, who received any di&s;gu&s;t, covered his re|bellion
under the pretence of principle; and even the
mother of this monarch, forgetting all the ties of na|ture,
was &s;educed to countenance the in&s;olence of his
enemies. Princes them&s;elves, unattentive to the perni|cious
con&s;equences of the&s;e papal claims, employed them
for their pre&s;ent purpo&s;es; and the controver&s;y, &s;pread|ing
into every city of Italy, engendered the parties of
Guelf and Ghibbelin; the mo&s;t durable and inveterate
factions that ever aro&s;e from the mixture of ambition and
&s;uper&s;tition. Be&s;ides numberle&s;s a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, tumults,
and convul&s;ions, to which they gave ri&s;e, it is computed

not, amid&s;t all his &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;&s;es, &s;ecured from the

a letter, requiring him to fulfil his promi&s;e in doing ho|mage
for the kingdom of England to the &s;ee of Rome,
and to &s;end him over that tribute, which all his predece&s;|&s;ors

fir&s;t a charitable donation of the Saxon princes, was in|terpreted,
according to the u&s;ual practice of the Romi&s;h
court, to be a badge of &s;ubjection acknowledged by the
kingdom. William replied, that the money &s;hould be
remitted as u&s;ual; but that he neither had promi&s;ed to do

the Roman pontiff. Gregory, while he was throwing all
Europe into combu&s;tion by his violence and impo&s;tures,
affected an anxious care for the purity of manners;
and even the cha&s;te plea&s;ures of the marriage-bed were
incon&s;i&s;tent, in his opinion, with the &s;anctity of the &s;acer|dotal
character. He had i&s;&s;ued a decree prohibiting the mar|riage
of prie&s;ts, excommunicating all clergymen who re|tained
their wives, declaring all &s;uch unlawful commerce to
be fornication, and rendering it criminal in the laity to at|tend
divine wor&s;hip when &s;uch profane prie&s;ts officiated at
the altar<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 455. 457 Flor. Wigorn. p. 638. Spell. Concil. fol. 13. A. D. 1076.</NOTE>. This point was a great object in the politics of
the Romi&s;h court; and it co&s;t them infinitely more pains to
e&s;tabli&s;h it than the propagation of any &s;peculative ab&s;urdi|ty,
which they had ever attempted to introduce. Many &s;y|nods
were &s;ummoned in different parts of Europe, before
it was finally fettled; and it was there con&s;tantly remark|ed,
that the younger clergymen complied chearfully with
the Pope's decrees in this particular, and that the chief
reluctance appeared in tho&s;e who were more advanced in
years: An event &s;o little conformable to men's fir&s;t ex|pectations,
that it could not fail to be glo&s;&s;ed on, even
in that blind and &s;uper&s;titious age. William allowed the
Pope's legate to a&s;&s;emble, in his ab&s;ence, a &s;ynod at
Winche&s;ter, in order to &s;ettle the celibacy of the clergy;
but the church of England could not yet be carried the
whole length expected; and the &s;ynod was content with
decreeing, that the bi&s;hops &s;hould not thenceforth ordain
any prie&s;ts or deacons without exacting from them a
promi&s;e of celibacy; but that none, except tho&s;e who
belonged to collegiate or cathedral churches, &s;hould be
obliged to &s;eparate from their wives.</P>
<P>THE King pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in Normandy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of prince Ro|bert.</NOTE> but his
long re&s;idence there was not entirely owing to his declar|ed.

preference of that dutchy: His pre&s;ence was al&s;o
nece&s;&s;ary for compo&s;ing tho&s;e di&s;turbances, which had
ari&s;en in that favourite territory, and which had even
originally proceeded from his own family. Robert, his
elde&s;t &s;on, &s;irnamed Gambaron or Courtho&s;e, from his
&s;hort legs, was a prince, who inherited all the bravery
of his family and nation; but without that policy and
di&s;&s;imulation, by which his father was &s;o much di&s;tin|gui&s;hed;
and which, no le&s;s than his military valour,
had contributed to his great &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Greedy of fame,
impatient of contradiction, without re&s;erve in his friend|&s;hips,
declared in his enmities, this prince could endure
no controul even from his imperious father, and openly
a&s;pired to that independance, to which his temper, as
well as &s;ome circum&s;tances in his &s;ituation, &s;trongly in|vited
him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 545. Hoveden, p. 457. Flor. Wigorn. p. 639.</NOTE>. When William fir&s;t received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions
of the province of Maine, he had promi&s;ed the inhabi|tants
that Robert &s;hould be their prince; and before he
undertook the expedition again&s;t England, he had, on
the application of the French court, declared him his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or in Normandy, and had obliged the barons of that
dutchy to do him homage as their future &s;overeign. By
this artifice, he had endeavoured to appea&s;e the jealou&s;y
of his neighbours, as affording them a pro&s;pect of &s;epa|rating
England from his dominions on the continent; but
when Robert demanded of him the execution of the&s;e en|gagements,
he gave him an ab&s;olute refu&s;al, and told
him, according to the homely &s;aying, that he never in|tended
to throw off his cloaths, till he went to bed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. de Mailr. p. 160.</NOTE>.
Robert openly declared his di&s;content; and was &s;u&s;|pected
of &s;ecretly in&s;tigating the King of France and the
earl of Brittanny to the oppo&s;ition which they made to
William, and which had formerly frustrated his attempts
<PB N="292" REF="322">
upon the town of Dol. And as the quarrel &s;till aug|mented,
Robert proceeded to entertain a &s;trong jealou&s;y
of his two &s;urviving brothers, William and Henry, (for
Richard was killed in hunting by a &s;tag) who, by greater
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and complai&s;ance, had acquired the affections
of their father. In this di&s;po&s;ition, the greate&s;t trifle &s;uf|ficed
to produce a rupture between them.</P>
<P>THE three princes, re&s;iding with their father in the
ca&s;tle of l'Aigle in Normandy, were one day engaged in
&s;port together; and after much frolic, the two younger
took it in their head to throw over &s;ome water on Robert
as he pa&s;&s;ed thro' the court on leaving their apartment<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 545.</NOTE>;
a pa&s;time, which he would naturally have regarded as in|nocent,
had it not been for the &s;ugge&s;tions of Alberic de
Grentme&s;nil, &s;on of that Hugh de Grentme&s;nil, whom
William had formerly deprived of his fortunes, when
that baron de&s;erted him during his greate&s;t difficult|ties
in England. This young nobleman, mindful of
the injury, per&s;uaded the prince, that this action was
meant as a public affront, which it behoved him in ho|nour
to refent; and the choleric Robert, drawing his
&s;word, ran up &s;tairs, with an intention of taking revenge
on his brothers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The whole ca&s;tle was full of tumult,
which the King him&s;elf, who ha&s;tened from his apart|ment,
found &s;ome difficulty to appea&s;e. But he could by
no means appea&s;e the re&s;entment of his elde&s;t &s;on, who,
complaining of his partiality, and fancying that no pro|per
atonement had been made him for the in&s;ult, left the
court that very evening, and ha&s;tened to Ro&uuml;en, with an
intention of &s;eizing the citadel of that place<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But being
di&s;appointed in this view by the precaution and vigilance
of Roger de Ivery, the governor, he fled to Hugh de
Neufchatel, a powerful Norman baron, who gave him
protection in his ca&s;tles; and he openly levied war again&s;t
<PB N="293" REF="323">
his father<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 545. Hoveden, p. 457. Sim. Dun. p. 210. Diceto, p. 487.</NOTE>. The popular character of the prince, and
a &s;ympathy of manners, engaged all the young nobility
of Normandy and Maine, as well as of Anjou and Brit|tanny,
to take part with him; and it was &s;u&s;pectced, that
Matilda, his mother, who&s;e favourite he was, &s;upported
him in his rebellion by &s;ecret remittances of money, and
by the encouragement, which &s;he gave his partizans.</P>
<P>ALL the hereditary provinces of William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1079.</NOTE> as well as
his family, were during &s;everal years thrown into convul|&s;ion
by this war; and he was at la&s;t obliged to have re|cour&s;e
to England, where that &s;pecies of military go|vernment,
which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed, gave him greater
authority than the antient feudal in&s;titutions permitted
him to exerci&s;e in Normandy. He called over an army
of Engli&s;h under his antient captains, who &s;oon expelled
Robert and his adherents from their retreats, and re&s;tored
the &s;overeign's authority in all his dominions. The young
prince was obliged to take &s;helter in the ca&s;tle of Ger|beroy
in the Beauvoi&s;is, which the King of France, who
&s;ecretly fomented all the&s;e di&s;cords, had provided for
him. In this fortre&s;s he was clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by his fa|ther,
again&s;t whom, having a &s;trong garri&s;on, he made
a gallant defence. There pa&s;t under the walls of this
place many rencounters, which re&s;embled more the &s;ingle
combats of chivalry, than the military actions of armies;
but one of them was remarkable for its circumstances
and its event. Robert happened to encounter with the
King, who was concealed by his helmet; and both being
valiant, a fierce combat en&s;ued, till at la&s;t the young
prince wounded his father in the arm, and threw him
from his hor&s;e. Calling for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his voice di&s;co|vered
him to his &s;on, who, &s;truck with remor&s;e for his
<PB N="294" REF="324">
pa&s;t crime, and a&s;toni&s;hed with the apprehen&s;ions of one
much greater, which he had &s;o nearly incurred, in&s;tant|ly
threw him&s;elf at his father's feet, craved pardon for
his offences, and offered to purcha&s;e forgivene&s;s by any
atonement<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Malme&s;. p. 106. H. Hunt. p. 369. Hoveden, p. 457. Flor. Wig. p. 639. Sim. Dun. p. 210. Diceto, p. 487. Knyghton, p. 2351. Alur Beverl. p. 135.</NOTE>. The re&s;entment, harboured by William,
was &s;o inveterate, that he did not immediately corre&s;pond
to this dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of his &s;on with like tenderne&s;s;
but giving him his malediction, departed for his own camp,
on Robert's hor&s;e, which that prince had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to
mount<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 369. Hoveden, p. 457. M. Paris, p. 7. Ypod. Neu$t. p. 439.</NOTE>. He &s;oon after rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and marched
with his army to Normandy; where the interpo&s;ition of
the Queen and other common friends brought about a
reconcilement, which was probably not a little forwarded
by the genero&s;ity of the &s;on's behaviour in this action,
and by the returning &s;en&s;e of his pa&s;t mi&s;condutct. The
King &s;eemed &s;o fully appea&s;ed, that he even carried over
Robert with him into England; where he intru&s;ted him
to repel an inroad of Malcolm King of Scots, and to
retaliate by a like inroad into that country. The Eng|li&s;h
prince was &s;ucce&s;sful, and obliged the enemy to
make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. The Wel&s;h, unable to re&s;i&s;t William's
power, were, about the &s;ame time, nece&s;&s;itated to make
&s;atisfaction for their incur&s;ions<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 184. M. We&s;t. p. 228.</NOTE>; and every thing was
reduced to a full tranquillity in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tate of affairs gave William Iei&s;ure to begin and
fini&s;h an undertaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1081.</NOTE> which proves his great and exten|&s;ive
genius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dome&s;day-book.</NOTE> and does honour to his memory: It was a

the quantity of meadow, pa&s;ture, wood, and arable
land, which they contained; and in &s;ome counties the
number of tenants, cottagers, and &s;laves of all denomi|nations,
who lived upon them. He appointed commi&s;|&s;ioners
for this purpo&s;e, who entered every particular in
their regi&s;ter by the verdict of juries; and after a labour
of fix years (for the work was &s;o long in fini&s;hing) brought
him an exact account of all the landed property of his
kingdom<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 190. Ingulf, p. 79. Chron. T. Tykes, p. 23. H. Hunt. p. 370. Hoveden, p. 460. M. We&s;t. p. 229. Flor. Wigorn. p. 641. Chron. Abb.

&s;ome extracts of it have hitherto been published, it &s;erves
to illu&s;trate to us in many particulars the antient &s;tate
of England. The great Alfred had fini&s;hed a like &s;ur|vey
of the kingdom in his time, which was long kept at
Winche&s;ter, and which probably &s;erved as a model to
William in this undertaking<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ingulf, p. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was naturally a great oeconomi&s;t; and
tho' no prince had ever been &s;o bountiful to his officers
and &s;ervants, it was merely becau&s;e he had rendered him|&s;elf
universal proprietor of England, and had a whole
kingdom to be&s;tow. He re&s;erved a very ample revenue
for the crown; and in the general distribution of land
among his followers, he kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no le&s;s than
1422 manors in different parts of England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">We&s;t's enquiry into the manner of creating peers, p. 24.</NOTE>, which paid
him rent either in money, or in corn, cattle, and the
u&s;ual produce of the land. An antient hi&s;torian com|putes,
that his annual fixed income, be&s;ides e&s;cheats,
<PB N="296" REF="326">
fines, reliefs, and other ca&s;ual profits to a great value,
amounted to near 400,000 pounds a year<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital, p. 523. He &s;ays 1060 pounds and &s;ome odd &s;hil|lings and pence a day.</NOTE>; a &s;um,
which, if all circum&s;tances he attended to, will appear
wholly incredible. A pound in that age, as we have
before ob&s;erved, contained three times the weight of &s;il|ver
that it does at pre&s;ent; and the &s;ame weight of &s;ilver,
by the mo&s;t probable computation, would purcha&s;e ten
times more of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, tho' not in the &s;ame
proportion of the finer manufactures. This revenue,
therefore, of William would be equivalent to at lea&s;t
nine or ten millions at pre&s;ent; and as that prince had
neither fleet nor army to &s;upport, the former being only
a ca&s;ual expence, and the latter maintained, without any
charge to him, by his military va&s;&s;als, we mu&s;t thence
conclude, that no emperor or prince, in any age or na|tion,
was ever to be compared to the Conqueror in opu|lence
and riches. This leads us to &s;u&s;pect a great mi&s;take
in the computation of the hi&s;torian; tho', if we con&s;ider
that avarice is always imputed to William as one of his
vices<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 188. 191. Malme&s;. p. 112. H. Hunt. p. 370. M. We&s;t. p. 229. Brompton, p. 979.</NOTE>, and that having by the &s;word rendered him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of all the lands in the kingdom, he would cer|tainly
in the partition retain a great proportion for his own
&s;hare; we can &s;carce be guilty of any error in a&s;&s;erting,
that no King of England was ever &s;o opulent, was &s;o
able to &s;upport by his revenue the &s;plendor and magnifi|cence
of a court, or could be&s;tow &s;o much on his plea|&s;ures
or in liberalities to his &s;ervants and favourites<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Forte&s;cue, de Dom. reg. &amp; politic. cap. 111.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was one plea&s;ure, to which William, as well as
all the Normans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new fore&s;t.</NOTE> and antient Saxons, was extremely addict|ed;
and that was hunting: But this plea&s;ure he indulged
more at the expence of his unhappy &s;ubjects, who&s;e intere&s;ts
<PB N="297" REF="327">
he always di&s;regarded, than to the lo&s;s or diminution of
his own revenue. Not contented with tho&s;e large fore&s;ts,
which the former Kings po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in all parts of England;
he re&s;olved to make a new fore&s;t near Winche&s;ter, the
u&s;uual place of his re&s;idence: And for that purpo&s;e, he
laid wa&s;te the country in Hamp&s;hire for an extent of
thirty miles, expelled the inhabitants from their hou&s;es,
&s;eized their property, even demoli&s;hed churches and con|vents,
and made the &s;ufferers no compen&s;ation for the
injury<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Malme&s;. p. 3. H. Hunt. p. 731. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 258.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time, he enacted new laws, by
which he prohibited all his &s;ubjects from hunting in any
of his fore&s;ts, and rendered the penalties much more &s;e|vere
than ever had been inflicted for &s;uch offences. The
killing of a deer or boar, or even of a hare, was puni&s;h|ed
with the lo&s;s of the delinquent's eyes<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 191. H. Hunt. p. 371. M. We&s;t. p. 229. Diceto, p. 488. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 258.</NOTE>; and that at a
time, when the killing of a man could be atoned for by
paying a moderate fine or compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE tran&s;actions, recorded during the remainder of
this reign, may be con&s;idered more as dome&s;tic occurren|ces,
which concern the prince, than as national events,
which regard England. Odo, bi&s;hop of Baieux, the
King's uterine brother, whom he had created earl of
Kent, and whom he had entru&s;ted with a great &s;hare of
power during his whole reign<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Order, Vital. p. 522. Frag. de Gul. Conq. p. 29.</NOTE>, had ama&s;&s;ed immen&s;e
riches; and agreeable to the u&s;ual progre&s;s of human
wi&s;hes, he began to regard his pre&s;ent acqui&s;itions but as
a &s;tep to farther grandeur. He had formed the chimerical
project of buying the papacy; and tho' Gregory, the
pre&s;ent Pope, was not of very advanced years, the prelate
had confided &s;o much in the predictions of an a&s;trologer,
that he made certain account of the pontiff's death, and
<PB N="298" REF="328">
of attaining, by his intrigues and money, that envied &s;tate
of greatne&s;s<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 646. Frag. de Gul. Conq. p. 29.</NOTE>. He re&s;olved, therefore, to tran&s;mit all
his riches to Italy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1082.</NOTE> and had per&s;uaded many confiderable
barons, and, among the re&s;t, Hugh earl of Che&s;ter, to
take the &s;ame cour&s;e; in hopes, that when he &s;hould
mount the papal throne, he would be&s;tow on them more
con&s;iderable e&s;tabli&s;hments in that country<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The King,
from whom all the&s;e projects had been carefully concealed,
at la&s;t got intelligence of the de&s;ign, and ordered Odo
to be arre&s;ted. His officers, re&s;pecting the immunities,
to which the eccle&s;ia&s;tics now pretended, &s;crupled to exe|cute
the command, till the King him&s;elf was obliged in
per&s;on to &s;eize him; and when Odo in&s;i&s;ted that he was
a prelate, and exempt from all temporal juri&s;diction,
William replied, that he arre&s;ted him, not as bi&s;hop of
Baieux, but as earl of Kent<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Abb. Sr. Petri de Burgo, p. 51. W. Malme&s;. p. 120.</NOTE>. He was &s;ent pri&s;oner

during the remainder of this reign<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 647. H. Hunt. p. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER dome&s;tic event gave the King much more
concern:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1083.</NOTE> It was the death of Matilda, his con&s;ort, whom
he tenderly loved, and for whom he had ever pre&s;erved
the mo&s;t &s;incere friend&s;hip. Three years afterwards, he
pa&s;&s;ed into Normandy, and carried with him Edgar
Atheling, to whom he very willingly granted per|mi&s;&s;ion
to make a pilgrimage into the holy land<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. p. 103.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1087.</NOTE>
He was detained on the continent by a mi&s;under&s;tand|ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1087</NOTE>

It was little in the power of princes at that time to
re&s;train their licentious nobility; but William &s;u&s;pected,
that the&s;e barons dared not to have provoked his indigna|tion,
had they not been a&s;&s;ured of the countenance and
protection of Philip. His di&s;plea&s;ure was increa&s;ed by
the account he received of &s;ome railleries which that mo|narch
had thrown out again&s;t him. William, who was
become corpulent, had been detained in bed &s;ome time
by &s;ickne&s;s; upon which Philip expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e
that his brother of England &s;hould be &s;o long in being
delivered of his great belly. The King &s;ent him word, that,
as &s;oon as he was up, he would pre&s;ent &s;o many lights at
Notre-dame, as would perhaps give l$$$le plea&s;ure to the
King of France; alluding to the u&s;ual practice at that
time of women after child-birth<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Malme&s;. p. 112. M. We&s;t. p. 230. M. Paris, p. 9. Brompton, p. 980. Knyghton, p. 2353. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 262.</NOTE>. Immediately on his
recovery, he led an army into the L'I&s;le de France, and
laid every thing wa&s;te with fire and &s;word: He took the
town of Mante, which he reduced to a&s;hes<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 655, Chron. de Mailr. p. 161.</NOTE>. But the
progre&s;s of the&s;e ho&s;tilities was &s;topt by an accident,
which &s;oon after put an end to William's life. His hor&s;e
&s;tarting a&s;ide of a &s;udden, he brui&s;ed his belly on the
pommel of his &s;addle<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Malme&s;. p. 112. M. Paris, p. 10. Knyghton, p. 2353.</NOTE>; and being in a bad habit of
body, as well as &s;omewhat advanced in years, he began
to apprehend the con&s;equences, and ordered him&s;elf to
be carried in a litter to the mona&s;tery of St. Gervais.
Finding his illne&s;s increa&s;e, and being &s;en&s;ible of the ap|proach
of death, he di&s;covered at la&s;t the vanity of all
human grandeur, and was &s;truck with remor&s;e for tho&s;e
horrible cruelties and violences, which, for the attain|ment

and defence of it, he had committed during the
cour&s;e of his reign over England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Frag. de Gul. Conq. p. 29, 30, 31.</NOTE>. He endeavoured to

<P>FEW princes have been more fortunate than this great
monarch, or were better entitled to grandeur and pro&s;pe|rity
from the abilities and the vigour of mind which he
di&s;played in all his conduct. His &s;pirit was bold and en|terpri&s;ing,
yet guided by prudence: His ambition, which
was exorbitant, and lay little under the re&s;traints of ju&s;|tice,
and &s;till le&s;s under tho&s;e of humanity, ever &s;ubmit|ted
to the dictates of rea&s;on and &s;ound policy. Born in
an age when the minds of men were intractable and un|acquainted
with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he was yet able to direct
them to his purpo&s;es; and partly from the a&s;cendant of
his vehement character, partly from art and di&s;&s;imulation,
<PB N="301" REF="331">
to e&s;tabli&s;h an unlimited authority. Tho' not in&s;en&s;ible
to genero&s;ity, he was hardened again&s;t compa&s;&s;ion; and
be &s;eemed equally o&s;tentatious and ambitious of eclat in
his clemency and in his &s;everity. The maxims of his
admini&s;tration were au&s;tere; but might have been u&s;eful,
had they been &s;olely employed in pre&s;erving order in an
e&s;tabli&s;hed government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t. p. 230. Anglia Sacra, vol. i. p. 258.</NOTE>: They were ill calculated for
&s;oftening the rigours, which, under the mo&s;t gentle ma|nagement,
are in&s;eparable from conque&s;t. His attempt
again&s;t England was the la&s;t great enterprize of the
kind, which, during the cour&s;e of &s;even hundred years,
has fully &s;ucceeded in Europe; and the greatne&s;s of his
genius broke thro' tho&s;e limits, which fir&s;t the feudal in|&s;titutions,
then the refined policy of princes, have fixed
to the &s;everal &s;tates of Chri&s;tendom. Tho' he rendered
him&s;elf infinitely odious to his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, he tran&s;|mitted
his power to his po&s;terity, and the throne is &s;till
filled by his de&s;cendants: A proof, that the foundations
which he laid were firm and &s;olid, and that, amid&s;t all
his violences, while he &s;eemed only to gratify the pre&s;ent
pa&s;&s;ion, he had &s;till an eye towards futurity.</P>
<P>SOME writers have been de&s;irous of refu&s;ing to this
prince the title of Conqueror, in the &s;en&s;e in which it
is commonly under&s;tood; and on pretence, that the word
is &s;ometimes in old books applied to &s;uch as make an ac|qui&s;ition
of territory by any means, they are willing to
reject William's title, by right of war, to the crown of
England. It is needle&s;s to enter into a controver&s;y,
which, by the terms of it, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily degenerate
into a di&s;pute of words. It &s;uffices to &s;ay, that the duke
of Normandy's fir&s;t inva&s;ion of the i&s;land was ho&s;tile;
that his &s;ub&s;equent admini&s;tration was entirely &s;upported
by arms; that in the very frame of his laws he made a
di&s;tinction between the Normans and Engli&s;h, to the ad|vantage
<PB N="302" REF="332">
of the former<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 600.</NOTE>; that he acted in every thing as
ab&s;olute ma&s;ter over the natives, who&s;e intere&s;ts&punc; and af|fections
he totally di&s;regarded; and that if there was an
internal when he a&s;&s;umed the appearance of a legal ma|gi&s;trate,
the period was very &s;hort, and was nothing but
a temporary &s;acrifice, which he, as has been the ca&s;e
with mo&s;t conquerors, was obliged to make of his incli|nation
to his pre&s;ent policy. Scarce any of tho&s;e revo|lutions,
which, both in hi&s;tory and in common language,
have always been denominated conque&s;ts, appear equally
violent, or have been attended with &s;o &s;udden an altera|tion
both of power and property. The Roman &s;tate,
which &s;pread its dominion over Europe, left the rights of
individuals, in a great mea&s;ure, untouched; and tho&s;e
civilized conquerors, while they made their own coun|try
the &s;eat of empire, found, that they could draw mo&s;t
advantage from the &s;ubject provinces, by be&s;towing on
the natives the free enjoyment of their own laws and of
their private po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The barbarians, who &s;ubdued
the Roman empire, tho' they &s;ettled in the conquered
countries, yet being accu&s;tomed to a rude uncultivated
life, found a &s;mall part of the land &s;ufficient to &s;upply all
their wants; and they were not tempted to &s;eize exten|&s;ive
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which they neither knew how to culti|vate
nor employ. But the Normans and other foreigners,
who followed the &s;tandard of William, while they made
the vanqui&s;hed kingdom the &s;eat of empire, were yet &s;o
far advanced in arts as to be acquainted with the advan|tages
of a large property; and having totally &s;ubdued
the natives, they pu&s;hed the rights of conque&s;t (very
exten&s;ive in the eyes of avarice and ambition, however
narrow in tho&s;e of rea&s;on) to the utmo&s;t extremity again&s;t
them. Except the former conque&s;t of England by the
Saxons them&s;elves, who were induced, by peculiar cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="303" REF="333">
to proceed even to the extermination of the
natives, it would be difficult to find in all hi&s;tory a revo|lution
more de&s;tructive, or attended with a more com|plete
&s;ubjection of the antient inhabitants. Contumely
&s;eems even to have been wantonly added to oppre&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 370. Brompton, p. 980.</NOTE>;
and the natives were univer&s;ally reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of
meanne&s;s and poverty, that the Engli&s;h name became a
term of reproach, and &s;everal generations elap&s;ed before
one family of Saxon pedigree was rai&s;ed to any consider|able
honours, or could &s;o much as attain the rank of
barons of the realm<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">So late as the reign of King Stephen, the earl of Albemarle, be|fore the battle of the Standard, addre&s;&s;ed the officers of his army in the&s;e terms: <HI>Procers Angliae clari&s;&s;imi, &amp; genere Normanni, &amp;c.</HI> Brompton, p. 10$6.

before intelligence of his father's death had reached that
kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. p. 120. M. Paris, p. 10.</NOTE>. Pretending orders from the King, he &s;ecu|red
the fortre&s;&s;es of Dover, Peven&s;ey, and Ha&s;tings,
who&s;e &s;ituation rendered them of the greate&s;t importance;

by which he hoped to encrea&s;e and encourage his par|tizans<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 192. Brompton, p. 983.</NOTE>. The primate, who&s;e rank and reputation in
the kingdom gave him great authority, had been entru&s;ted
<PB N="306" REF="336">
with the care of his education,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V.</NOTE> and had conferred on
him the honour of knighthood<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. p. 120. M. Paris, p. 10. Thom. Rudborne, p. 263.</NOTE>; and being connected
with him by the&s;e ties, and probably deeming his preten|&s;ions
ju&s;t, declared that he would pay a willing obedience
to the la&s;t will of the Conqueror, his friend and bene|factor.
Having a&s;&s;embled &s;ome bi&s;hops and &s;ome of the
principal nobility, he in&s;tantly proceeded to the ceremony
of crowning the new King<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 461.</NOTE>; and by this di&s;patch pre|vented
all danger of faction and re&s;i&s;tance. At the &s;ame
time, Robert, who had been already acknowledged &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or
to Normandy, took peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that dutchy.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this partition appeared to have been made<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;piracy again&s;t the King.</NOTE>
without any violence or oppo&s;ition, there remained in
England many cau&s;es of di&s;content, which &s;eemed to
menace that kingdom with a &s;udden revolution. The
Norman barons, who generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;d large e&s;tates
both in England and in their own country, were unea&s;y
at the &s;eparation of the&s;e territories; and fore&s;aw, that
as it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to pre&s;erve long their
allegiance to two ma&s;ters, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ign either
their antient property or their new acqui&s;itions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Order. Vitalis, p. 666.</NOTE>. Robert's
title to the dutchy they e&s;teemed inconte&s;tible; his claim
to the kingdom plau&s;ible; and they all de&s;ired that this
prince, who alone had any preten&s;ions to unite the&s;e ter|ritories,
&s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both. A compa|ri&s;on
al&s;o of the per&s;onal qualities of the&s;e two princes,
led them to give the preference to the elder. The duke
was brave, open, &s;incere, generous; and even his pre|dominant
faults, his extreme indolence and facility, were
not di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e haughty barons, who affected
independance, and &s;ubmitted with reluctance to a rigorous
<PB N="307" REF="337">
admini&s;tration in their &s;overeign. The King, tho' equal|ly
brave as his brother, was violent, haughty, tyranni|cal;

than by the love of his people<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. p. 120. Order. Vitalis, 666.</NOTE>. Odo, bi&s;hop of Baieux,
and Robert earl of Mortaigne, maternal brothers of the
Conqueror, envying the great credit of Lanfranc, which
was encrea&s;ed by his late &s;ervices, enforced all the&s;e mo|tives
with their partizans, and engaged them in a formal
con&s;piracy to dethrone the King<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 461. Sim. Dunelm. p. 214. Diceto, p. 489.</NOTE>. They communi|cated
their de&s;ign to Eu&s;tace, count of Bologne, Roger

Roger Bigod, Hugh de Grentme&s;nil; and they
ea&s;ily procured the a&s;&s;ent of the&s;e potent noblemen.

A con&s;piracy of his own barons, which was

and he engaged in it the count d'Eu, Richard de
Tunbrige, Roger de Lacey, and many others. The

and to advance in his &s;tead, Stephen, count of Aumale,
nephew to the Conqueror<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 465. Sim. Dun. p. 221.</NOTE>. William's expedition pre|vented

BUT the noi&s;e of the&s;e petty wars and commotions
was quite &s;unk in the tumult of the Cru&s;ades, which now
engro&s;&s;ed the attention of all Europe, and have ever &s;ince
employed the curio&s;ity of mankind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cru&s;ades.</NOTE> as the mo&s;t &s;ignal
and mo&s;t durable monument of human folly, that has yet
appeared in any age or nation. After Mahomet had, by
means of his pretended revelations, united the di&s;per&s;ed
Arabians under one heady they i&s;&s;ued forth from their
de&s;arts in great multitudes; and being animated with
zeal for their new religion, and &s;upported by the vigor
of their new government, they made deep impre&s;&s;ions on
the ea&s;tern empire, which was far in the decline, with
regard both to military discipline and to civil policy.
Jeru&s;alem, by its &s;ituation, became one of their mo&s;t
early conque&s;ts; and the Chri&s;tians had the mortification
to fee the holy &s;epulchre, and the other places, made
famous by the pre&s;ence of their religious founder, fallen
into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of infidels. But the Arabians or Sa|racens
were &s;o employed in military enterprizes, by
which they &s;pread their empire, in a few years, from
tre banks of the Ganges to the &s;traits of Gibraltar, that
they had no lei&s;ure for theological controver&s;y; and tho'
the Alcoran, the original monument of their faith, &s;eems
to contain &s;ome violent precepts, they were much le&s;s
infected with the &s;pirit of bigotry and pro&s;ecution than
the &s;peculative Greeks, who were continually refining
on the &s;everal articles of their religious &s;y&s;tem. They
gave little disturbance to tho&s;e zealous pilgrims, who
daily flocked to Jeru&s;alem; and they allowed every man,
after paying; a moderate tribute, to vi&s;it the holy &s;e|pulchre,
to perform, his religious duties, and to return
in peace. But the Turcomans or Turks, a tribe of
Tartars, who bad embraced Mahometi&s;m, having wre&s;ted
Syria from the Saracens, and having in the year 1065,
made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Jeru&s;alem, rendered the pil|grimage
much more difficult and dangerous to the Chri|&s;tians.
<PB N="315" REF="347">
The barbarity of their manners, and the con|fufions
attending their un&s;ettled government, expo&s;ed the
pilgrims to many in&s;ults, robberies, and extortions; and
the&s;e zealots, returning from their meritorious fatigues
and &s;ufferings, filled all Chri&s;tendom with indignation
again&s;t the infidels, who profaned the holy city by their
pre&s;ence, and derided the &s;acred my&s;teries in the very
place of their completion. Gregory VII. among the
other va&s;t ideas, which he entertained, had formed the
de&s;ign of uniting all the we&s;tern Chri&s;tians again&s;t the
Mahometans; but his exorbitant enterprizes again&s;t the
civil power of princes, had created him &s;o many enemies,
and had rendered his &s;chemes &s;o &s;u&s;picious, that he was
not able to make great progre&s;s in this undertaking.
The work was re&s;erved for a meaner in&s;trument, who&s;e
low condition expo&s;ed him to no jealou&s;y, and who&s;e
folly was well calculated to coincide with the prevailing
principles of the times.</P>
<P>PETER, commonly called the Hermit, a native of
Amiens in Picardy, had made the pilgrimage to Jeru&s;a|lem;
and being deeply affected with the dangers, to
which that act of piety now expo&s;ed the pilgrims, as
well as with the in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion, under which the
ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians laboured, he entertained the bold, and,
in all appearance, impracticable project of leading into
A&s;ia, from the farthe&s;t extremities of the we&s;t, armies
&s;ufficient to &s;ubdue tho&s;e potent and warlike nations,
which now held the holy land in &s;lavery and &s;ubjection<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gu'. Tyrius, lib. 1. cap. 11. M. Paris, p. 17.</NOTE>.

chair, and who, tho' he was &s;en&s;ible of the advan|tages,
which the head, of the Chri&s;tian religion mu&s;t
reap from a religious war, and tho' he e&s;teemed the blind
zeal of Peter a proper means for effecting the purpo&s;e<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gul. Tyrius, lib. 1. cap. 13.</NOTE>,
<PB N="316" REF="348">
re&s;olved not to interpo&s;e his authority, till he &s;aw a
greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;ummoned a council
at Placentia, which con&s;i&s;ted of four thou&s;and eccle&s;i|a&s;tics
and thirty thou&s;and &s;eculars; and which was &s;o
numerous, that no hall could contain the multitude, and
it was nece&s;&s;ary to hold the a&s;&s;embly in a plain. The
harangues of the pope, and of Peter him&s;elf, repre&s;ent|ing
the di&s;mal &s;ituation of their brethren in the ea&s;t, and
the indignity, &s;uffered by the Chri&s;tian name, in allow|ing
the holy city to remain in the hands of the infidels,
here found the minds of men &s;o well prepared, that the
whole multitude, as if actuated by a &s;upernatural in|&s;tinct,
declared for the war, and &s;olemnly devoted them|&s;elves to perform this &s;ervice, &s;o meritorious, as they be|lieved
it, towards God and religion.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Italy &s;eemed thus to have embraced zea|lou&s;ly
the de&s;ign, Martin ju&s;tly thought, that, in order
to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, it was nece&s;&s;ary to inli&s;t the greater
and more warlike nations in the &s;ame engagement; and
having exhorted Peter previously to vi&s;it the chief cities
and &s;overeigns of Chri&s;tendom, he &s;ummoned another
council at Clermont in Auvergne<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Concil. tom. 10. Concil. Clarom. Matth. Paris, p. 16. M. We&s;t. p. 233.</NOTE>. The &s;ame of this
great and pious de&s;ign, being now univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed,
procured the attendance of the greate&s;t prelates, nobles,
and princes; and when the Pope and the hermit renew|ed
their pathetic exhortations, the whole a&s;&s;embly, as if
impelled by an immediate in&s;piration, not moved by
their preceding impre&s;&s;ions, exclaimed with one voice,
<HI>It is the will of God, It is the will of God:</HI> Words deemed
&s;o memorable, and &s;o much the re&s;ult of a divine influ|ence,

The &s;ign of the cro&s;s, which had been hitherto
&s;o much revered among Chri&s;tians, and which, the more
it was an object of reproach among infidels, was the
more pa&s;&s;ionately cheri&s;hed by them, became the badge

who inli&s;ted them&s;elves in this &s;acred warfare<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Bell. Sacri, tom. 1, Mu&s; Ital, Order. Vital. p. 721.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EUROPE was at this time &s;unk into a profound ignor|ance
and &s;uper&s;tition: The eccle&s;ia&s;tics had acquired the
greate&s;t a&s;cendant over the human mind: The people,
who, being little re&s;trained by honour and le&s;s by law,
abandoned them&s;elves to the greate&s;t crimes and di&s;or|ders,
knew of no other expiation than the ob&s;ervances
impo&s;ed on them by their &s;piritual pa&s;tors: And it was
ea&s;y to repre&s;ent the holy war as an equivalent for all
penances<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 720.</NOTE>, and an atonement for every violation of
ju&s;tice or humanity. But amid&s;t the abject &s;uper&s;tition,
which now prevailed, the military &s;pirit al&s;o had uni|ver&s;ally
diffu&s;ed it&s;elf; and tho' not &s;upported by art or
di&s;cipline, was become the general pa&s;&s;ion of the nations,
governed by the feudal law. All the great lords po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
the right of peace and war: They were engaged
in continual ho&s;tilities with each other: The open coun|try
was become a &s;cene of outrage and di&s;order: The
cities, which were &s;till mean and poor, were neither
guarded by walls, nor protected by privileges, and were
expo&s;ed to each in&s;ult: Every man was obliged to de|pend
for &s;afety on his own force, or his private allian|ces:
And valour was the only excellence, which was
held in e&s;teem, or gave one man the pre-eminence above
another. When all the particular &s;uper&s;titions, therefore,
Were here united in one great object, the ardour for pri|vate
<PB N="318" REF="350">
ho&s;tilities took the &s;ame direction; and Europe,
impelled by its two ruling pa&s;&s;ions, was loo&s;ened, as it
were, from its foundations, and &s;eemed to precipitate it|&s;elf
in one united body upon the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>ALL orders of men, deeming the cru&s;ades the only
road to heaven, inli&s;ted them&s;elves under the&s;e &s;acred
banners, and were impatient to open the way with their
&s;word to the holy city. Nobles, artizans, pea&s;ants,
even prie&s;ts<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 720.</NOTE> inrolled their names; and to decline this
meritorious &s;ervice was branded with the reproach of
impiety, or what perhaps was e&s;teemed &s;till more di&s;|graceful,
of cowardice and pu&s;illanimity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 133.</NOTE>. The infirm
and aged contributed to the expedition by pre&s;ents and
money; and many of them, not &s;atisfied with the merit
of this atonement, attended it in per&s;on, and were deter|mined,
if po&s;&s;ible, to breathe their la&s;t, in &s;ight of that
city where their Saviour had died for them. Women
them&s;elves, concealing their &s;ex under the di&s;gui&s;e of

<P>THE &s;mallne&s;s of this &s;um, with the difficulties which
William found in rai&s;ing it, &s;uffices alone to refute the
account, which is heedle&s;sly adopted by hi&s;torians, of the
enormous revenue of the Conqueror. Is it credible,
that Robert would con&s;ign into the rapacious hands of
his brother &s;uch con&s;iderable dominions, for a &s;um,
which, according to that account, made not a week's
income of his father's trea&s;ury? Or that the King of
England could not on demand, without oppre&s;&s;ing his
&s;ubjects, have been able to pay him the money? The
Conqueror, it is agreed, was frugal as well as rapacious;
and yet his trea&s;ure, at his death, exceeded not 60,000
pounds, which would have been no more than his in|come
for two months: Another certain refutation of that
exaggerated account.</P>
<P>THE fury of the cru&s;ades, during this age, le&s;s in|fected
England than the neighbouring kingdoms; prob|ably
becau&s;e the Norman conquerors, finding their &s;et|tlement
in that kingdom &s;till &s;omewhat precarious, dared
not to abandon their own hou&s;es, in que&s;t of di&s;tant ad|ventures.
The &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;ted humour al&s;o of the
King, which kept him from kindling in the general
flame, checked its progre&s;s among his &s;ubjects; and as
he is accu&s;ed of open profanene&s;s<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">G. Neubr. p. 358. W. Gemet. p. 292.</NOTE>, and was endowed
with a &s;harp wit<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Malm. p. 122.</NOTE>, it is likely that he made the roman|tic
chivalry of the cru&s;ades the object of his perpetual ri|dicule.
As an in&s;tance of his irreligion, we are told,
that he once accepted of &s;ixty marks from a Jew, who&s;e
elde&s;t &s;on had been converted to Chri&s;tianity, and who
engaged him by that pre&s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in bringing
back the youth to Judai&s;m. William employed both
<PB N="322" REF="354">
menaces and per&s;ua&s;ion to that purpo&s;e; but finding the
new convert ob&s;tinate in his faith, he &s;ent for the father,
and told him, that as he had not &s;ucceeded, it was not
ju&s;t that he &s;hould keep the pre&s;ent; but as he had done
his utmo&s;t, it was but equitable that he &s;hould be paid for
his pains; and he would therefore only retain thirty
marks of the money<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 47.</NOTE>. At another time, it is &s;aid he
&s;ent for &s;ome learned Chri&s;tian theologians and &s;ome
rabbies, and bade them fairly di&s;pute the que&s;tion of
their religion in his pre&s;ence: He was perfectly indif|ferent
between them, had his ears open to rea&s;on and
conviction, and would embrace that doctrine, which
upon compari&s;on &s;hould be found &s;upported by the mo&s;t
&s;olid arguments<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 123.</NOTE>. If this &s;tory be true, it is probable
that he meant only to amu&s;e him&s;elf by turning both in|to
ridicule: But we mu&s;t be cautious of admitting every
thing related by the monki&s;h hi&s;torians to the di&s;advant|age
of this prince: He had the misfortune to be engaged
in quarrels with the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, particularly with An|&s;elm,
commonly called St. An&s;elm, archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury;
and it is no wonder his memory &s;hould be
blackened by the hi&s;torians of that order.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of Lanfranc,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarrel with An|&s;elm, the primate.</NOTE> the King, for &s;everal
years, retained in his own hands the revenues of Can|terbury,
as well as tho&s;e of many other vacant bi&s;hop|rics;
but falling into a dangerous illne&s;s, he was &s;eized
with remor&s;e, and the clergy repre&s;ented to him, that he
was in danger of eternal perdition, if before his death he
did not make atonement for tho&s;e multiplied impieties
and &s;acrileges, of which he had been guilty<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 16. Chron. Sax. p. 198. H. Hunt. p. 373. Hove|den, p. 463. M. Paris, p. 12. Annul. Waverl&punc; p. 138. T. Rudb. p. 264. Flor. Wigorn. p. 645. Sim. Dunelm, p. 217. Diceto, p. 490.</NOTE>. He re|&s;olved
therefore to &s;upply in&s;tantly the vacancy of Can|terbury;
and for that purpo&s;e he &s;ent for An&s;elm, a Pied|monte&s;e

by birth, abbot of Bec in Normandy, who was
much celebrated for his learning and devotion. The
abbot refu&s;ed earne&s;tly the dignity, fell on his knees,
wept, and entreated the King to change his purpo&s;e<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 17. Diceto, p. 494.</NOTE>;
and when he found the prince ob&s;tinate in forcing the
pa&s;toral &s;taff upon him, he kept his fi&s;t &s;o fa&s;t clenched,
that it required the utmo&s;t violence of the by&s;tanders to
open it, and force him to receive that en&s;ign of &s;piritual
dignity<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 18.</NOTE>. William &s;oon after recovered his health; and
his pa&s;&s;ions regaining their u&s;ual force and vigour, he
returned to his former violence and rapine<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. P. 373. M. Paris, p. 12. Diceto, p. 494.</NOTE> He re|tained
in pri&s;on &s;everal per&s;ons whom he had ordered to
be freed during the time of his penitence; he &s;till preyed
upon the eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices; the &s;ale of &s;piritual dig|nities
continued as open as ever; and he retained po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a con&s;iderable part of the revenues belonging
to the &s;ee of Canterbury<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 19. 43. Chron. Sax. p. 199.</NOTE>. But he found in An&s;elm
that per&s;evering oppo&s;ition, which he had rea&s;on to ex|pect
from the oftentatious humility, which that prelate
had employed in refu&s;ing his promotion.</P>
<P>THE oppo&s;ition of An&s;elm was the more dangerous on
account of the character of piety, which be &s;oon acquir|ed
in England, by his great zeal again&s;t all abu&s;es, par|ticularly
tho&s;e in dre&s;s and ornament. There was a
mode, which, in that age, prevailed throughout Europe,
both among men and women, to give an enormous
length to their &s;hoes, to draw the toe to a &s;harp point,
and to affix to it the figure of a bird's bill, or &s;ome &s;uch
ornament, which was turned upwards, and which was
often &s;u&s;tained by gold or &s;ilver chains tied to the knee<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 682. W. Malme&s; p. 123. Knyghton, p. 2369.</NOTE>.
The eccle&s;ia&s;tics took exception at this ornament, which,
they &s;aid, was an attempt to bely the Scripture, where it
<PB N="324" REF="356">
is affirmed, that no man can add a cubit to his &s;tature;
and they declaimed again&s;t it with great vehemence, nay
a&s;&s;embled &s;ame &s;ynods, who ab&s;olutely condemned it.
But &s;uch are the &s;trange contradictions in human na|ture!
Tho' the clergy, at that time, could overturn
thrones, and had authority &s;ufficient to &s;end above a
million of men on <HI>their</HI> errand to the de&s;arts of A&s;ia,
they never could prevail again&s;t the&s;e long-pointed &s;hoes:
On the contrary, that caprice, contrary to all other modes, maintained its ground during &s;everal centuries;
and if the clergy had not at la&s;t de&s;i&s;ted from their per|&s;ecutions
of it, it might &s;till have been the prevailing
fa&s;hion in Europe.</P>
<P>BUT An&s;elm was more fortunate in decrying the par|ticular
mode, which was the object of his aver&s;ion, and
which probably had not taken &s;uch fa&s;t hold of the af|fections
of the people. He preached zealou&s;ly again&s;t
the long hair and curled locks, which were then fa&s;hion|able
among the courtiers; he refu&s;ed the a&s;hes on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day
to tho&s;e who were &s;o accoutered; and his
authority and eloquence had &s;uch influence, that the
young men univer&s;ally abandoned that ornament, and
appeared in the cropt hair, which was recommended to
them by the &s;ermons of the primate. The noted hi&s;to|rian
of An&s;elm, who was al&s;o his companion and &s;ecre|tary,
celebrates highly this effort of his zeal and piety<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN William's profanene&s;s therefore returned to
him with his health, he was &s;oon engaged in controver|sies
with this au&s;tere prelate. There was at that time
a &s;chi&s;m in the church, between Urban and Clement,
who both pretended to the papacy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 463.</NOTE>; and An&s;elm, who,
as abbot of Bec, had already acknowledged the former,
was determined, without the King's con&s;ent, to intro|duce
<PB N="325" REF="357">
his authority into England<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 25. M. Paris, p. 13. Diceto, p. 494. Spelm. Conc. vol. ii. p. 16.</NOTE>. William, who, imi|tating
his father's example, had prohibited his &s;ubjects,
from recognizing any Pope, whom he had not previ|ou&s;ly
received, was enraged at this preten&s;ion; and &s;um|moned
a &s;ynod at Rockingham, with an intention of de|po&s;ing
An&s;elm; but that prelate's &s;uffragans declared,
that, without the papal authority, they knew of no ex|pedient
for inflicting that cen&s;ure on their primate<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 30.</NOTE>.
The King was at la&s;t engaged by other motives to give
the preference to Urban's title; An&s;elm received the
pall from that pontiff; and matters &s;eemed to be tolera|bly
compo&s;ed between the King and the primate<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 495.</NOTE>, when
the quarrel broke out afre&s;h from a new cau&s;e. William
had undertaken an expedition again&s;t Wales, and re|quired
the archbi&s;hop to furni&s;h his quota of &s;oldiers for
that &s;ervice; but An&s;elm, who regarded the demand as
an oppre&s;&s;ion on the church, and yet dur&s;t not refu&s;e
compliance, &s;ent them &s;o mi&s;erably equipped, that the
King was extremely di&s;plea&s;ed, and threatened him with
a pro&s;ecution<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 37, 43.</NOTE>. An&s;elm, on the other hand, demanded
po&s;itively, that all the revenues of his &s;ee &s;hould be re|&s;tored
to him; appealed to Rome again&s;t the King's in|ju&s;tice<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 40.</NOTE>; and affairs came to &s;uch extremities, that the
primate, finding it dangerous to remain in the kingdom,
de&s;ired the King's permi&s;&s;ion to retire beyond &s;ea. All
his temporalities were confi&s;cated<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 13. Parker, p. 178.</NOTE>; but he was received
with great re&s;pect by Urban, who con&s;idered him as a
martyr in the cau&s;e of religion, and even menaced the
King, on account of his proceedings again&s;t the primate
and the church, with the &s;entence of excommunication.
An&s;elm a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the council of Bari, where, be&s;ides
fixing the controver&s;y between the Greek and Latin
<PB N="326" REF="358">
churches, about the proce&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 49. M. Paris, p. 13. Sim. Dunelm. p. 224.</NOTE>, the
right of election to church preferments was declared to
belong to the clergy alone, and &s;piritual cen&s;ures were
denounced again&s;t all eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who did homage to
laymen for their &s;ees or benefices, and on all laymen who
exacted it<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 14.</NOTE>. The rite of homage, by the feudal cu&s;toms,
was, that the va&s;&s;al &s;hould throw him&s;elf on his knees,
&s;hould put his joined bands between tho&s;e of his &s;uperior,
and &s;hould in that po&s;ture &s;wear fealty to him<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Spellman, Du Cange, in verb. <HI>Hominium.</HI></NOTE> But
the council declared it execrable, that pure hands, which
could create God, and could offer him up as a &s;acrifice
for the &s;alvatlon of mankind, &s;hould be put, after this
humiliating manner, between profane hands, which, be|&s;ides
being inured to rapine and blood&s;hed, were employ|ed
day and night in impure purpo&s;es and ob&s;cene con|tacts<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Heming. p. 467. Flor. Wigorn. p. 649. Sim. Dunelm. p. 224. Brompton, p. 994.</NOTE>. Such were the rea&s;onings prevalent in that age;
rea&s;onings, which, tho' they cannot be pa&s;&s;ed over in
&s;ilence, without omitting the mo&s;t curious and, perhaps,
not the lea&s;t in&s;tructive part of hi&s;tory, can &s;carce be de|livered
with the requi&s;ite decency and gravity.</P>
<P>THE ce&s;&s;ion of Wormandy and Maine by duke Ro|bert
increased mightily the King's territories; but brought
him no great increa&s;e of power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1097</NOTE> becau&s;e of the un&s;ettled
&s;tate of the&s;e countries, the mutinous di&s;po&s;ition of the
barons, and the near neighbourhood of the French King,
who &s;upported them in all their in&s;urrections. Even
Helie, lord of la Fleche, a &s;mall town in Anjou, was
able to give him inquietude; and this great monarch was
obliged to make &s;everal expeditions abroad, without being
able to prevail over &s;o petty a baron, who had acquired
<PB N="327" REF="359">
the confidence and affections of the inhabitants of Maine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1098.</NOTE>
He was, however, &s;o fortunate, as at la&s;t to take him
pri&s;oner in a rencounter; but having relea&s;ed him, at
the interce&s;&s;ion of the French King and the count d'An|jou,
he found the province of Maine &s;till expo&s;ed to his
intrigues and incur&s;ions. Helie, being introduced by the
citizens into the town of Mans, be&s;ieged the garri&s;on
in the citadel; and William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1099.</NOTE> who was hunting in the
new fore&s;t, when he received this intelligence, was &s;o
provoked, that he immediately turned about his hor&s;e's
head, and galloped to the &s;ea-&s;hore at Dartmouth; de|claring,
that he would not &s;top a moment till he had ta|ken
vengeance for this offence. He found the weather
&s;o cloudy and tempe&s;tuous, that the mariners declared it
dangerous to put to &s;ea; but the King hurried on board,
and ordered them to &s;et &s;ail; telling them, that they ne|ver
yet heard of a King that was drowned<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 124. H. Hunt. p. 378. M. Paris, p. 36. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 442.</NOTE>. By this
vigour and celerity, he delivered the citadel of Mans
from its pre&s;ent danger; and pur&s;uing Helie into his
own territories, he laid &s;iege to Majol, a &s;mall ca&s;tle in
tho&s;e parts: But a wound, which he received in the
a&s;&s;ault, obliged him to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and he returned
to England.</P>
<P>The weakne&s;s of the greate&s;t monarchs, during this
age, in their military expeditions again&s;t their neare&s;t
neighbours, appears the more &s;urpri&s;ing, when we con|&s;ider
the prodigious numbers, which even petty princes,
&s;econding the enthu&s;ia&s;tic rage of the people, were able
to a&s;&s;emble, and to conduct in dangerous enterprizes to
the remote provinces of A&s;ia. William, earl of Poitiers
and duke of Guyenne, enflamed with the glory, and not
di&s;couraged by the misfortunes, which had attended the
former adventurers in the cru&s;ades, had put him&s;elf at
<PB N="328" REF="360">
the head of an immen&s;e multitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1100.</NOTE> computed by &s;ome
hi&s;torians to amount to 60,000 hor&s;e, and a much greater
number of foot<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 149. The whole is &s;aid by Order. Vital. p. 789, to amount to 300,000 men.</NOTE>, and propo&s;ed to lead them into the
holy land again&s;t the infidels. He wanted money to
forward the preparations requi&s;ite for this expedition,
and he offered to mortgage all his dominions to William,
without entertaining any &s;cruple on account of that ra|pacious
and iniquitous hand, into which he re&s;olved to
con&s;ign them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s; p. 127.</NOTE>. The King accepted his offer; and had
prepared a fleet, and an army, in order to e&s;cort the mo|ney,
and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rich provinces of Guienne
and Poictou;<NOTE PLACE="marg">$xd Augu&s;t.</NOTE> when an accident put an end to his life,
and to all his ambitious projects. He was engaged in
hunting, the &s;ole amu&s;ement, and indeed the chief oc|cupation
of princes in tho&s;e rude times, when &s;ociety was
little cultivated, and the arts afforded few objects worthy
of attention. Walter Tyrrel, a French gentleman, re|markable
for his addre&s;s in archery, attended him in this
recreation, of which the new fore&s;t was the &s;cene; and
as William had di&s;mounted after a chace, Tyrrel, impa|tient
to &s;how his dexterity, let fly an arrow at a &s;tag,
which &s;uddenly &s;tarted before him, The arrow, glancing
from a tree, &s;truck the King in the brea&s;t, and in&s;tantly
flew him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 126. H. Hunt. p. 378. M. Paris, p. 37. Petr. Bel&s;. p. 110.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE> while Tyrrel, without informing any one
of the accident, put &s;purs to his hor&s;e, ha&s;tened to the
&s;ea-&s;hore, embarked for France, and joined the cru&s;ade
in an expedition to Jeru&s;alem; a penance which he im|po&s;ed
on him&s;elf for this involuntary crime. The body
of William was found in the fore&s;t by the country-people,
and was buried without any pomp or ceremony
at Winche&s;ter. His courtiers were negligent in perform|ing
<PB N="329" REF="361">
their la&s;t duty to a ma&s;ter who was &s;o little beloved;
and every one was too much occupied in the intere&s;ting
object of fixing his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, to attend the funerals of a
dead &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE memory of this monarch is tran&s;mitted to us
with little advantage by the churchmen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and character of William Rufus.</NOTE> whom he had
offended; and tho' we may &s;u&s;pect in general, that their
account of his vices is &s;omewhat exaggerated, his con|duct
affords little rea&s;on for contradicting the character
which they have a&s;&s;igned him, or for attributing to him
any very e&s;timable qualities. He &s;eems to have been a
violent and tyrannical prince; a perfidious, encroaching,
and dangerous neighbour; an unkind and ungenerous
relation. He was equally prodigal and rapacious in the
management of his trea&s;ury; and if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed abilities,
he lay &s;o much under the government of impetuous pa&s;|&s;ions,
that he made little u&s;e of them in his admini&s;tration;
and he indulged entirely that domineering policy,
which &s;uited his temper, and which, if &s;upported, as it
was in him, with courage and vigour, proves often more
&s;ucce&s;sful, in di&s;orderly times, than the deepe&s;t fore&s;ight
and mo&s;t refined artifice.</P>
<P>THE monuments which remain of this prince in Eng|land
are the Tower, We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and London-bridge,
which he built. The mo&s;t laudable foreign en|terprize
which he undertook, was the &s;ending Edgar
Atheling, three years before his death, into Scotland
with a &s;mall army, to re&s;tore prince Edgar the true heir
of that kingdom, &s;on of Malcolm, and of Margaret,

which, even if they had fore&s;een them, it would have
been almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to provide a proper remedy. The
Greek Emperor, Alexis Comnenus, who had applied to
the we&s;tern chri&s;tians for &s;uccour again&s;t the Turks, en|tertained
hope, and that but a feeble one, of only obtaining
&s;uch a moderate &s;upply, as, acting under his
command, might enable him to repul&s;e the enemy: But
he was extremely a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee his dominions over|whelmed,
on a &s;udden, with &s;uch an inundation of licen|tious
barbarians, who, tho' they pretended friend&s;hip,
de&s;pi&s;ed his &s;ubjects as unwarlike, and dete&s;ted them as
heretical. By all the arts of policy, in which he excel|led,
he endeavoured to divert the torrent; but while he
<PB N="332" REF="364">
employed profe&s;&s;ions, care&s;&s;es, civilities, and &s;eeming &s;er|vices
towards the leaders of the cru&s;ade, he &s;ecretly re|garded
tho&s;e imperious allies as more dangerous than
the open enemies, by whom his empire had been for|merly
invaded. Having effectuated that difficult point
of di&s;embarking them &s;afely in A&s;ia, he entered into a
private corre&s;pondence with Soliman, Emperor of the
Turks; and practi&s;ed every in&s;idious art, which his ge|nius,
his power, or his &s;ituation enabled him to employ,
for di&s;appointing the enterprize, and di&s;couraging the
Latins from making thenceforward any &s;uch prodigious
migrations. His dangerous policy was &s;econded by the
di&s;orders, in&s;eparable from &s;o va&s;t a multitude, who were
not united under one head, and were conducted by leaders
of the mo&s;t independant, intractable &s;pirits, unacquainted
with military di&s;cipline, and &s;till more enemies to civil
authority and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, the
exce&s;&s;es of fatigue, the influence of unknown climates,
joined to the want of concert in their operations, and the
&s;word of a warlike enemy, de&s;troyed the adventurers by
thou&s;ands, and would have abated the ardor of men, im|pelled
to war by le&s;s powerful motives. Their zeal,
however, their bravery, and their irre&s;i&s;tible force &s;till
carried them forward, and continually advanced them to
the great end of their enterprizes. After an ob&s;tinate
&s;iege, they took Nice, the &s;eat of the Turki&s;h empire;
they defeated Soliman in two great battles; they made
them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Antioch; and entirely broke the
force of the Turks, who had &s;o long retained the&s;e
countries in &s;ubjection. The &s;oldan of Egypt, who&s;e
alliance they had hitherto courted, recovered, on the fall
of the Turki&s;h power, his former authority in Jeru&s;alem;
and informed them by his amba&s;&s;adors, that, if they came
di&s;armed to that city, they might now perform their reli|gious
vows, and that all Chri&s;tian pilgrims, who &s;hould
<PB N="333" REF="365">
thenceforth vi&s;it the holy $epulchre, might expect the &s;ame
treatment, which they had ever received from his
predece&s;&s;ors. This offer was rejected; the &s;oldan was
required to yield up the city to the Chri&s;tians; and on
his refu&s;al, the champions of the cro&s;s advanced to the
&s;iege of Jeru&s;alem, which they regarded as the con&s;um|mation
of their labours. By the detachments, which
they had made, and the di&s;a&s;ters, which they had under|gone,
they were dimini&s;hed, to the number of twenty
thou&s;and foot and fifteen hundred hor&s;e; but the&s;e were
&s;till formidable from their valour, their experience, and
the obedience, which, at the price of pa&s;t calamities,
they had learned to pay to their leaders. After a &s;iege
of five weeks, they took Jeru&s;alem by a&s;&s;ault; and, im|pelled
by a mixture of military and religious rage, they
put the numerous garri&s;on and inhabitants to the &s;word
without di&s;tinction. Neither arms defended the valiant,
nor &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the timorous: No age nor &s;ex was &s;pared:
Infants on the brea&s;t were pierced by the &s;ame blow with
their mothers, who implored for mercy: Even a multi|tude,
to the number of ten thou&s;and per&s;ons, who had
&s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners, and were promi&s;ed
quarter, were butchered in cold blood by the&s;e ferocious
conquerors<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Vertot, vol. i, p. 57.</NOTE>. The &s;treets of Jeru&s;alem were covered
with dead bodies<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 34. Order. Vitat. p. 756. Diceto, p. 498.</NOTE>; and the triumphant warriors, after
every enemy was &s;ubdued and &s;laughtered, immediately
turned them&s;elves, with the &s;entiments of humiliation
and contrition, towards the holy &s;epulchre. They threw
a&s;ide their arms, &s;till &s;treaming with blood: They ad|vanced
with reclined bodies, and naked feet and head to
that facred monument: They &s;ung anthems to their
Saviour who had purcha&s;ed their &s;alvation by his death
and agony; And their devotion, enlivened by the pre|&s;ence

of every &s;oft and tender &s;entiment<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 34. Order. Vital. p. 756.</NOTE>. So incon|&s;i&s;tent
is human nature with it&s;elf! And &s;o ea&s;ily does
the mo&s;t effeminate &s;uper&s;tition ally both with the mo&s;t
heroic courage, and with the fierce&s;t barbarity!</P>
<P>THIS great event happened on the fifth of July in the
la&s;t year of the eleventh century. The Chri&s;tian pri|nces
and nobles, after choo&s;ing Godfrey of Boulogne King
of Jeru&s;alem, began to &s;ettle them&s;elves in their new
conque&s;ts; while &s;ome of them returned to Europe, in
order to enjoy at home that glory which their valour had
acquired them in this popular and meritorious enterprize.
Among the&s;e, was Robert, duke of Normandy, who,
as he had abandoned the greate&s;t dominions of any prince,
that attended the cru&s;ade, had all along di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf by the mo&s;t intrepid courage<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 35. W. Heming. p. 467. G. Newbrig. p. 358.</NOTE>, as well as by that
affable di&s;po&s;ition and unbounded genero&s;ity, which gain
the hearts of &s;oldiers, and qualify a prince to &s;hine in a
military life. In pa&s;&s;ing thro' Italy, he became acquainted
with Sibylla, daughter of the count of Conver&s;ana, a
young lady of great beauty and merit, whom he e&s;pou|&s;ed<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 153. Gul. Gemet. p. 299.</NOTE>; and indulging him&s;elf in this new pa&s;&s;ion, as well
as fond of enjoying ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, after the fatigues
of &s;o many rough campaigns, he lingered a twelvemonth
in that delicious climate; and tho' his friends in the
north looked every moment for his arrival, none of them
knew when they could with certainty expect it. By this
delay, he lo&s;t the kingdom of England, which the great
fame he had acquired during the cru&s;ades, as well as his
undoubted title, both by birth, and by the preceding
agreement with his decea&s;ed brother, would, had he been
pre&s;ent, have infallibly &s;ecured to him.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="367">
PRINCE Henry was hunting with Rufus in the new
fore&s;t, when intelligence of that prince's death was
brought him; and being &s;en&s;ible of the advantage, at|tending
the conjuncture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acce&s;&s;ion of Henry.</NOTE> he immediately galloped to
Winche&s;ter, in order to &s;ecure the royal trea&s;ure, which
he knew to be a nece&s;&s;ary implement for facilitating his
de&s;igns on the crown. He had &s;carcely reached the place
when William de Breteuil, keeper of the trea&s;ure, arri|ved,
and oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to Henry's preten&s;ions. This
nobleman, who had been engaged in the &s;ame party of
hunting, had no &s;ooner heard of his ma&s;ter's death,
than he ha&s;tened to take care of his charge; and he told
the prince, that this trea&s;ure, as well as the crown, be|longed
to his elder brother, who was now his &s;overeign;
and that he him&s;elf, for his part, was determined, in
&s;pite of all other preten&s;ions, to maintain his allegiance
to him. But Henry, drawing his &s;word, threatened him
with in&s;tant death, if he dared to di&s;obey him; and as
others of the late King's retinue, who came every mo|ment
to Winche&s;ter, joined the prince's party, Breteuil
was obliged to withdraw his oppo&s;ition, and to acqui|e&s;ce in this violence<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 782.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, without lo&s;ing a moment, ha&s;tened with his
money to London; and having a&s;&s;embled &s;ome noblemen
and prelates, whom his addre&s;s, or abilities, or pre&s;ents,
gained to his &s;ide, he was &s;uddenly elected, or rather &s;a|luted
King; and immediately proceeded to the exerci&s;e
of the royal dignity. In le&s;s than three days after his
brother's death, the ceremonial of his coronation was
performed by Maurice, bi&s;hop of London, who was
per&s;uaded to officiate on that occa&s;ion<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 208. Order. Vital. p. 783.</NOTE>; and thus, by
his courage and celerity, he intruded him&s;elf into the va|cant
throne. No one had &s;ufficient &s;pirit or &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="336" REF="368">
duty to appear in defence of the ab&s;ent prince: All men
were &s;educed or intimidated: Pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;upplied
the apparent deficiencies of Henry's title, which was in|deed
founded on plain u&s;urpation: And the barons, as
well as the people, acquie&s;ced in a claim, which, tho' it
could neither be ju&s;tified nor comprehended, could now,
they found, be oppo&s;ed only thro' the perils of civil war
and rebellion.</P>
<P>BUT as Henry ea&s;ily fore&s;aw, that a crown, u&s;urped
again&s;t all rules of ju&s;tice, would &s;it very un&s;teady on
his head, he re&s;olved, by fair profe&s;&s;ions at lea&s;t, to gain
the affections of all his &s;ubjects. Be&s;ides taking the u&s;ual
coronation-oath to maintain the laws and execute ju&s;tice,
he pa&s;&s;ed a charter, which was calculated to remedy
many of the grievous oppre&s;&s;ions, which had been com|plained
of during the reign of his father and brother<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 208. Sim. Dunelm. p. 225. Brompton, p. 997.</NOTE>.
He there promi&s;ed, that, upon the death of any bi&s;hop
or abbot, he never would &s;eize the revenues of the &s;ee
or abbey during the vacancy, but would leave the whole
to be reaped by the &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and that he would never
let to farm any eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefice, nor di&s;po&s;e of it
for money. After this conce&s;&s;ion to the church, who&s;e
favour was of &s;o great con&s;equence, he proceeded to
enumerate the civil grievances, which he purpo&s;ed to re|dre&s;s.
He promi&s;ed, that upon the death of any earl,
baron, or military tenant, his heir &s;hould be admitted to
the po&s;&s;e&s;ion of his e&s;tate, on paying a ju&s;t and lawful
relief; without being expo&s;ed to &s;uch exorbitant exac|tions
as had been required during the late reigns: He
remitted the ward&s;hip of minors, and allowed guardians
to be appointed, who &s;hould be an&s;werable for the tru&s;t:
He promi&s;ed not to di&s;po&s;e of any heire&s;s in marriage,
but by the advice of all the barons; and if any baron in|tended
to give his daughter, &s;i&s;ter, niece, or kin&s;woman,
<PB N="337" REF="369">
in marriage, it &s;hould only be nece&s;&s;ary for him to con|&s;ult the King, who promi&s;ed to take no money for his
con&s;ent, nor ever to refu&s;e permi&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s the per&s;on
to whom it was propo&s;ed to marry her &s;hould happen to
be his enemy: He granted his barons and military tenants
the power of bequeathing by will their money or per&s;onal
e&s;tates; and if they neglected to make a will, he pro|mi&s;ed,
that their heirs &s;hould &s;ucceed to them: He remit|ted
the right of impo&s;ing moneyage, and of levying
taxes at plea&s;ure on the farms, which the barons retained
in their own hands<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See Appendix II.</NOTE>: He made &s;ome general profe&s;&s;ions
of moderating fines; he offered a pardon for all offen|ces;
and he remitted all debts due to the crown: He re|quired,
that the va&s;&s;als of the barons &s;hould enjoy the
&s;ame privileges, which he granted to his own barons;
and he promi&s;ed a general confirmation and ob&s;ervance
of the laws of King Edward. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of
the chief articles contained in that famous charter<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, p. 38. Hoveden, p. 468. Brompton, p. 1021. H$gul&s;tad, p. 310.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To give greater authenticity to the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, Henry
lodged a copy of his charter in &s;ome abbey of each
county; as if de&s;irous, that it &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the
eyes of all his &s;ubjects, and remain as a perpetual rule
for the limitation and direction of his government: Yet
is it certain, that, after the pre&s;ent turn was &s;erved, he
never once thought, during his reign, of ob&s;erving one
&s;ingle article of it; and the whole fell &s;o much into ne|glect
and oblivion, that, in the following century, when
the barons, who had heard an ob&s;cure tradition of it,
de&s;ired to make it the model of the great charter, which
they exacted from King John, they could only find one
copy of it in the whole kingdom. Bat as to the grievan|ces
here propo&s;ed to be redre&s;&s;ed, they were &s;till con|tinued
<PB N="338" REF="370">
in their full extent; and the royal authority, in
all the&s;e heads, lay under no manner of re&s;triction. Re|liefs
of heirs, &s;o capital an article, were never effectually
fixed till the time of Magna Charta<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Glanv. lib. 2. cap. 36. What is called a relief in the Conqueror's laws, pre&s;erved by Ingulf, &s;eems to have been the herriot; &s;ince reliefs, as well as the other burdens of the feudal law, were unknown in the age of the Confe&s;&s;or, who&s;e laws the&s;e originally were.</NOTE>; and it is evident,
that the general promi&s;e here given, of accepting a ju&s;t
and lawful relief, ought to have been reduced to more
preci&s;ion, in order to give &s;ecurity to the &s;ubject. The
oppre&s;&s;ion of ward&s;hip and marriage was perpetuated
even till the age of Charles II.: And it appears from
Glanville<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7. cap. 16. This practice was contrary to the laws of King Edward, ratified by the Conqueror, as we learn from Ingulf, p. 9$. But laws had at that time very little influence: Power and violence governed every thing.</NOTE>, the famous ju&s;ticiary of Henry II. that in
his time, where any man died inte&s;tate, an accident
which mu&s;t be very frequent, when the art of writing
was &s;o little known, the King, or the lord of the fief,
pretended to &s;eize all the moveables, and to exclude
every heir, even the children of the decea&s;ed: A &s;ure
mark of a tyrannical and arbitrary government.</P>
<P>THE Normans indeed, &s;ettled in England, were,
during this age, &s;o violent and licentious a people, that
they may be pronounced incapable of any true or regular
liberty; which requires &s;uch a refinement of laws and
in&s;titutions, &s;uch a comprehen&s;ion of views, &s;uch a &s;enti|ment
of honour, &s;uch a &s;pirit of obedience, and &s;uch a
&s;acrifice of private intere&s;t and connexions to public or|der,
as can only be the re&s;ult of great reflection and ex|perience,
and mu&s;t grow to perfection during &s;everal ages
of a &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed government. A people, &s;o
in&s;en&s;ible to the rights of their &s;overeign, as to disjoint,
<PB N="339" REF="371">
without nece&s;&s;ity, the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and permit a
younger brother to intrude him&s;elf into the place of the
elder, whom they e&s;teemed, and who was guilty of no
crime but being ab&s;ent, could not expect, that that
prince would pay any greater regard to their privileges,
or allow his engagements to fetter his power, and debar
him from any con&s;iderable intere&s;t or convenience. They
had indeed arms in their hands, which prevented the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of a total de&s;poti&s;m, and left their po&s;terity
&s;ufficient power, whenever they &s;hould attain a &s;ufficient
degree of rea&s;on, to acquire true liberty: But their tur|bulent
di&s;po&s;ition prompted them frequently to make &s;uch
u&s;e of their arms, that they were more fitted to ob&s;truct
the execution of ju&s;tice, than to &s;top the career of violence
and oppre&s;&s;ion. The prince, finding, that greater oppo|&s;ition
was often made to him when he enforced the laws,
than when he violated them, was apt to render his own
will and plea&s;ure the &s;ole rule of government, and on
every emergence to con&s;ider more the power of the per|&s;ons
whom he might offend, than the rights of tho&s;e
whom he might injure. The very form of this charter
of Henry proves, that the Norman barons (for they,
rather than the people of England, are chiefly concerned
in it) were totally ignorant of the nature of limited mo|narchy,
and were ill qualified to conduct, in conjunction
with their &s;overeign, the machine of government. It
is an act of his &s;ole power, is the re&s;ult of his free grace,
implies &s;everal articles which bind others as well as
him&s;elf, and is therefore unfit to be the deed of any one
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not the whole legi&s;lative power, and who
may not at plea&s;ure revoke all his conce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>KING Henry, farther to increa&s;e his popularity, de|graded
and committed to pri&s;on Ralph Flambard, bi&s;hop
of Durham, who had been the chief in&s;trument of op|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="340" REF="372">
employed by his brother<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 208. W. Malm. p 156. Matth. Paris, p. 39. Alur. Beverl. p. 144.</NOTE>: But this act was
followed by another, which was a direct violation of his
own charter, and was a bad progno&s;tic of his &s;incere intentions to ob&s;erve it: He kept the &s;ee of Durham
vacant for five years, and during that time retained po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of all its revenues. Sen&s;ible of the great autho|rity,
which An&s;elm had acquired by his character of
piety, and by the per&s;ecutions which he had undergone
from William, he &s;ent repeated me&s;&s;ages to him at Lyons,
where he re&s;ided, and invited him to return and take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dignities<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 208. Order. Vital. p. 783. Matth. Paris, p. 39. T. Rudborne, p. 273.</NOTE>. On the arrival of the prelate,
he propo&s;ed to him the renewal of that homage which
he had done his brother, and which had never been refu|&s;ed
by any Engli&s;h bi&s;hop: But An&s;elm had acquired
other &s;entiments by his journey to Rome, and gave the
King an ab&s;olute refu&s;al. He objected the decrees of
the council of Bari, at which he him&s;elf had a&s;&s;i&s;ted;
and he declared, that &s;o far from doing homage for his
&s;piritual dignity, he would not &s;o much as communicate
with any eccle&s;ia&s;tic who paid that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or who
accepted of inve&s;titures from laymen. Henry, who pro|po&s;ed
in his pre&s;ent delicate &s;ituation, to reap great ad|vantages
from the authority and popularity of An&s;elm,
dared not to quarrel with him by in&s;i&s;ting on his demand<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>:
He only de&s;ired that the controver&s;y might be &s;u&s;pended;
and that me&s;&s;engers might be &s;ent to Rome, to accom|modate
matters with the Pope, and to obtain his confirmation
of the laws and cu&s;toms of England.</P>
<P>THERE immediately occurred an important affair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the King</NOTE> in
which the King was obliged to have recour&s;e to the
<PB N="341" REF="373">
authority of An&s;elm. Matilda, daughter of Malcolm III.
King of Scotland, and niece to Edgar Atheling, had,
on her father's death, and the &s;ub&s;equent revolutions of
the Scotti&s;h government, been, brought up to England,
and educated under her aunt, Chri&s;tina, in the nunnery
of Rum&s;ey. This prince&s;s Henry propo&s;ed to marry;
but as &s;he had worn, the veil, tho' never taken the vows,
doubts might ari&s;e concerning the lawfulne&s;s of the act;
and it behoved him to be very careful not to &s;hock, in any
particular, the religious prejudices of his &s;ubjects. The
affair was examined by An&s;elm in a council of the pre|lates
and nobles, which was &s;ummoned at Lambeth;
and Matilda there proved, that &s;he had put on the veil,
not with a view of entering into a religious life, but
merely in imitation of a cu&s;tom, familiar to the Engli&s;h
ladies, who protected their cha&s;tity from the brutal vio|lence
of the Normans, by taking &s;helter under that
habit<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 57.</NOTE>, which, amid&s;t the horrible licentiou&s;ne&s;s of
the times, was generally revered. The council, &s;en&s;ible
that even a prince&s;s bad otherwi&s;e no &s;ecurity for her ho|nour,
admitted this rea&s;on as valid: They pronounced,
that Matilda was &s;till free to marry<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; and her e&s;pou&s;als
with Henry were celebrated by An&s;elm with great pomp
and &s;olemnity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 468.</NOTE>. No act of the King's reign rendered
him equally popular with his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, and tended
more to e&s;tabli&s;h him on the throne. Tho' Matilda,
during the life of her uncle and brothers, was not the
heir of the Saxon line, &s;he was become very dear to the
Engli&s;h, on account of her connexions with it: And
that people, who, before the conque&s;t, had fallen into
a kind of indifference towards their antient royal family,
had felt &s;o &s;everely the tyranny of the Normans, that
they reflected with infinite regret on their former liberty,
and hoped for a more equal and mild admini&s;tration,

when the blood of their native princes &s;hould be united
with that of their new &s;overeigns<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the policy and prudence of Henry, which, if
time had been allowed for the&s;e virtues to operate their
full effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion by duke Ro|bert.</NOTE> would have &s;ecured him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown,
ran great hazard of being fru&s;trated by the &s;udden ap|pearance
of Robert, who returned to Normandy about a
month after the death of his brother William. He took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without re&s;i&s;tance, of that dutchy; and imme|diately
made preparations for recovering England, of
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1101.</NOTE> during his ab&s;ence, he had, by Henry's intrigues,
been &s;o unju&s;tly defrauded. The great fame which he

Henry, in this extremity, began to be apprehen&s;ive for
his life, as well as for his crown; and had recour&s;e to
the &s;uper&s;tition of the people, in order to oppo&s;e their
&s;entiment of ju&s;tice. He paid diligent court to An&s;elm,

obedience to the decrees of councils, and to the

he gained entirely the confidence of the pri|mate,
who&s;e influence over the people, and authority
with the barons, was of the highe&s;t &s;ervice to him; in his
pre&s;ent &s;ituation. An&s;elm &s;crupled not to a&s;&s;ure the
nobles of the King's &s;incerity in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions which
he made, of avoiding the tyrannical and oppre&s;&s;ive go|vernment
of his father and brother<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>: He even rode
thro' the ranks of the army, recommended to the &s;oldi|ers

powerful barons, who &s;till adhered to the pre&s;ent govern|ment<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 783.</NOTE>, the army were retained in the King's intere&s;ts,

hearkened the more willingly to the mediation of

determined, that noblemen &s;o powerful and &s;o ill
affected, who had both inclination and ability to di&s;turb
his government, &s;hould not long remain unmole&s;ted in
their pre&s;ent grandeur and opulence. He began with the
earl of Shrew&s;bury, who was watched for &s;ome time by
&s;pies, and then indicted on a charge, con&s;i&s;ting of forty-five
articles. This turbulent nobleman, knowing his
own guilt, as well as the prejudices of his judges
and the power of his accu&s;er, had recour&s;e to arms for
defence; but being &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the activity

of his two brothers, Arnulf de Montgomery, and Roger
earl of Lanca&s;ter. Soon after followed the pro&s;ecution

at the fate of his friends, imprudently ventured to

with &s;uch a bad reception, that he began to apprehend

he might u&s;e his authority for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e

he was only attentive to &s;upport his own parti|zans,
and to encrea&s;e their number by every art of bri|bery,
intrigue, and in&s;inuation. Having found, in a
vi&s;it, which he made to that dutchy, that the nobility
were more di&s;po&s;ed to pay &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him than to their
legal &s;overeign; he collected, by very arbitrary extor|tions
on England, a great army and trea&s;ure<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 83.</NOTE>, and re|turned
next year to Normandy, in a &s;ituation to obtain,
eithier by violence or corruption, the dominion of that
province.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1105.</NOTE> He took Bayeux by &s;torm after an ob&s;tinate
frege: He made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Caen by the voluntary
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the inhabitants: But being repul&s;ed at Fa|lai&s;e,
and obliged, by the winter &s;ea&s;on, to rai&s;e the
&s;iege, he returned into England; after giving a&s;&s;urances
to his adherents, that he would per&s;evere in &s;upporting
and protecting them.</P>
<P>NEXT year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1106.</NOTE> he opened the campaign with the &s;iege of
Tenchebray;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conque&s;t of Normandy.</NOTE> and it became evident, from his prepa|rations
and progre&s;s, that he intended to u&s;urp the entire
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Normandy. Robert was at la&s;t rouzed from
his lethargy; and, being &s;upported by the earl of Mor|taigne
and Robert de Belle&s;me, the King's inveterate
enemies, he rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable army, and approached
his brother's camp, with a view of fini&s;hing, in one de|ci&s;ive
<PB N="347" REF="379">
battle, the quarrel between them. He was now
entered on that &s;cene of action, in which alone he was
qualified to excel; and he &s;o animated the Norman
troops by his example, that they made a great impre&s;&s;ion
on the Engli&s;h, and had nearly obtained the victory<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 379. M. Paris, p. 43. Brompton, p. 1002.</NOTE>;
when the flight of Belle&s;me threw them into di&s;may,
and occasioned their tocal defeat. Henry, be&s;ides exe|cuting
great &s;laughter on the enemy, made near ten
thou&s;and pri&s;oners; among whom was duke Robert
him&s;elf, and all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable barons, who ad|hered
to his intere&s;ts<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 90. Chron. Sax. p. 214. Order. Vital. P. 821.</NOTE>. This victory was followed by
the final reduction of Normandy: Ro&uuml;en immediately
&s;ubmitted to the cbnqueror: Falai&s;e, after &s;ome nego|tiation,
opened its gates; and by this acqui&s;ition, be&s;ides
rendering him&s;elf ma&s;ter of an important fortre&s;s, he got
into his hands prince William, the only &s;on and heir of
Robert: He a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of Normandy; and
having received the homage of all the va&s;&s;als of the
dutchy, &s;ettled the government, revoked his brother's
donations, and di&s;mantled the ca&s;tles, lately built, he re|turned
into England, and carried along with him the
duke as a pri&s;oner. That unfortunate prince was detained
in cu&s;tody during the remainder of his life, which was
no le&s;s than twenty-eight years, and he died in the ca&s;tle
of Cardiff in Glamorgan&s;hire; happy, if, without lo&s;ing
his liberty, he could have relinqui&s;hed that power,
which he was not qualified either to hold or exerci&s;e.
Prince William was committed to the care of Helie de
St. Saen, who had married Robert's natural daughter,
and who, being a man of probity and honour, more
than was u&s;ual in tho&s;e ages, executed the tru&s;t with
great affection and fidelity. Edgar Atheling, who had
followed Robert in the expedition to Jeru&s;alem, and
<PB N="348" REF="380">
who had lived with him ever &s;ince in Normandy, was
another illu&s;trious pri&s;oner, taken in the battle of Ten|chebray<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 214. Ann. Waverl. p. 144.</NOTE>. Henry gave him his liberty, and &s;ettled a
&s;mall pen&s;ion on him, with which he retired; and he
lived to a good old age in England, totally neglected and
forgotten. This prince was di&s;tingui&s;hed by per&s;onal
bravery; but nothing can be a &s;tronger proof of his
mean talents in every other re&s;pect, than that, notwith|&s;tanding
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the affections of the Engli&s;h, and
enjoyed the only legal title to the throne, he was allow|ed,
during the reigns of &s;o many violent and jealous
u&s;urpers, to live unmole&s;ted, and go to his grave in
peace.</P>
<P>A LITTLE after Henry had compleated the conque&s;t of
Normandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1107.</NOTE> and &s;ettled the government of that province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continua|tion of the quarrel with An|&s;elm the primate.</NOTE>
he fini&s;hed a controver&s;y, which had been long depend|ing
between him and the Pope, with regard to the in|ve&s;titures in eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices; and tho' he was
here obliged to relinqui&s;h &s;ome of the antient rights of
the crown, he extricated him&s;elf from the difficulty on
ea&s;ier terms than mo&s;t princes, who in that age were &s;o
unhappy as to be engaged in di&s;putes with the apo&s;tolic
&s;ee. The King's &s;ituation, in the beginning of his reign,
obliged him to pay great court to An&s;elm; and the ad|vantages,
which he had reaped from the zealous friend|&s;hip
of that prelate, had made him &s;en&s;ible how prone
the minds of his people were to &s;uper&s;tition, and what
an a&s;cendant the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had been able to a&s;&s;ume
over them. He had &s;een, on the acce&s;&s;ion of his brother
Rufus, that, tho' the rights of primogeniture were then
violated, and the inclinations of almo&s;t all the barons
oppo&s;ed, yet the authority of Lanfranc had prevailed
over all other con&s;iderations; and his own ca&s;e, which
<PB N="349" REF="381">
was &s;till more unfavourable, afforded an in&s;tance, in
which the clergy could &s;how more evidently their in|fluence
and authority. The&s;e recent examples, while
they made him cautious not to offend that powerful body,
convinced him, at the &s;ame, time, that it was extremely
his intere&s;t, to retain the former prerogative of the
crown in filling offices of &s;uch va&s;t importance, and to
check the eccle&s;ia&s;tics in that independance, to which
they evidently a&s;pired. The choice, which his brother,
in a fit of penitence, had made of An&s;elm, was &s;o far
unfortunate to the King's preten&s;ions, that that prelate
was celebrated for his piety and zeal and au&s;terity of
manners; and tho' his monki&s;h devotion and narrow
principles progno&s;ticated no great knowledge of the
world nor depth of policy, he was, on that very ac|count,
a more dangerous in&s;trument in the hands of po|liticians,
and retained a greater a&s;cendant over the bi|gotted
populace. The prudence and temper of the King
appear in nothing more con&s;picuous than in the manage|ment
of this delicate affair; where he was always &s;en|&s;ible
that it had become nece&s;&s;ary for him to ri&s;que his
whole crown, in order to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t invaluable
jewel of it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 56.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANSELM had no &s;ooner returned from bani&s;hment,
than his rcfu&s;al to do homage to the King excited a dif|pute,
which Henry evaded at that critical juncture, by
promising to &s;end a me&s;&s;enger, in order to compound
the matter with Pa&s;cal the &s;econd, who then filled the
papal chair. The me&s;&s;enger, as was probably fore&s;een,
returned with an ab&s;olute refu&s;al of the King's de|mands<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>; and that fortified by many rea&s;ons, which were
well qualified to operate on the under&s;tandings of men
in tho&s;e ages. Pa&s;cal quoted the &s;criptures to prove that

eccle&s;ia&s;tics mu&s;t enter into the church thro' Chri&s;t alone,
not thro' the civil magi&s;trate, or any profane laymen<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 60. This topic is farther enforced in p. 73, 74. W. Malm. p. 163.</NOTE>.
&startq;It is mon&s;trous,&endq; added the pontiff, &startq;$that a &s;on
&s;hould pretend to beget his father, or a man to create
his God: Prie&s;ts are called gods in &s;cripture, as

Yet it pa&s;&s;ed current in tho&s;e ages, and was often quoted by the clergy as the foundation of their power. See Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT however convincing the&s;e arguments, they could
not per&s;uade Henry to re&s;ign &s;o important a prerogative;
and perhaps, as he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great reflection and
learning, he thought, that the ab&s;urdity of a man's cre|ating
his God, even allowing prie&s;ts to be gods, was
not urged with the be&s;t grace by the Roman pontiff.
But as he de&s;ired &s;till to avoid, or at lea&s;t to delay, the
coming to any dangerous extremity with the church, he
per&s;uaded An&s;elm, that he would be able, by farther ne|gociation,
to attain &s;ome compo&s;ition with Pa&s;cal; and
for that purpo&s;e, he di&s;patched three bi&s;hops to Rome,
while An&s;elm &s;ent two me&s;&s;engers of his own, to be
more fully a&s;&s;ured of the Pope's intentions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 62. W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>. Pa&s;cal
wrote back letters equally positive and arrogant both to
the King and primate; urging to the former, that, by
a&s;&s;uming the right of inve&s;titures, he committed a kind
of &s;piritual adultery with the church, who was the &s;pou&s;e
of Chri&s;t, and who mu&s;t not admit of &s;uch a commerce
with any other per&s;on<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eadm$r, p. 63.</NOTE>; and in&s;i&s;ting with the latter,
that the preten&s;ions of Kings to confer benefices was the

foundation in tho&s;e ages<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 64. 66.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY had now no other expedient than to &s;uppre&s;s
the letter addre&s;&s;ed to him&s;elf, and to per&s;uade the three
bi&s;hops to prevaricate, and a&s;&s;ert, upon their epi&s;copal
faith, that Pa&s;cal had a&s;&s;ured them in private of his good
intentions towards Henry, and of his re&s;olution not to
re&s;ent any future exertion of his prerogative in granting
inve&s;titures; tho' he him&s;elf &s;crupled to give this a&s;&s;ur|ance
under his hand, left other princes &s;hould copy the
example and a&s;&s;ume a like privilege<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 65. W. Malm. p. 225.</NOTE>. An&s;elm's two
me&s;&s;engers, who were monks, affirmed to him, that it
was impo&s;ible this &s;tory could have any foundation;
but their word was not e&s;teemed equivalent to that of
three bi&s;hops; and the King, as if he had finally gained
his cau&s;e, proceeded to fill the &s;ees of Hereford and Sa|li&s;bury,
and to inve&s;t the new bi&s;hops in the u&s;ual man|ner<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 66. W. Malm. p. 225. Hoveden, p. 469. Sim. Dunelm. p. 228.</NOTE>.
But An&s;elm, who, as he had good rea&s;on, gave
no credit to the a&s;&s;everation of the King's me&s;&s;engers,
refu&s;ed not only to con&s;ecrate them, but even to com|municate
with them; and the bi&s;hops them&s;elves, find|ing
how odious they had become, returned back to Henry
the en&s;igns of their dignity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 470. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 59. Flor. Wigorn. p. 651.</NOTE>. The quarrel every day

as &s;hould pretend to opp&s;e him in exerting the antient

make a journey to Rome, in order to lay the ca&s;e before

without violence of &s;o inflexible an antagoni&s;t, readily
granted him permi&s;&s;ion; and An&s;elm &s;et out on his

<P>THE policy of the court of Rome has been commonly
much admired; and men, judging by &s;ucce&s;s, have be|&s;towed
the highe&s;t eulogies on that prudence, by which
a power, from &s;uch &s;lender beginnings, could advance,
without force of arms, to e&s;tabli&s;h an univer&s;al and al|mo&s;t
ab&s;olute monarchy in Europe. But the wi&s;dom of
&s;uch a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men, who filled the papal
throne, and who were of &s;uch different ages, tempers,
and intere&s;ts, is not intelligible, and could never have
place in nature. The in&s;trument, indeed, with which
they wrought, the ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition of the
people, is &s;o gro&s;s an engine, of &s;uch univer&s;al preva|lence,
and &s;o little liable to accident or di&s;order, that it
may be &s;ucce&s;sful even in the mo&s;t un&s;kilful hands; and
&s;carce any indi&s;cretion can fru&s;trate its operations.
While the court of Rome was openly abandoned to the
mo&s;t flagrant di&s;orders, even while it was torn with
&s;chi&s;ms and factions, the power of the church made daily
a &s;en&s;ible progre&s;s in Europe; and the temerity of Gregory
and the caution of Pa&s;cal were equally fortunate in
promoting it. The clergy, feeling the nece&s;&s;ity of pro|tection
again&s;t the violence of princes, or vigour of the
laws, were well plea&s;ed to adhere to a foreign head,
who, being removed from the fear of the civil authority,
could freely employ the power of the whole church in
defending their antient or u&s;urped properties and privi|leges,
when invaded in any particular country: The
monks, de&s;irous of an independance on their dioce&s;ans,
<PB N="354" REF="388">
profe&s;&s;ed &s;till a more devoted attachment to the triple
crown; and the &s;tupid people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no &s;cience nor
rea&s;on, which they could oppo&s;e to the mo&s;t exorbitant
preten&s;ions. Non&s;en&s;e pa&s;&s;ed for demon&s;tration: The
mo&s;t criminal means were &s;anctified by the piety of the
end: Treaties were not &s;uppo&s;ed to be binding where
the intere&s;ts of God were concerned: The antient laws
and cu&s;toms of &s;tates had no authority again&s;t a divine
right: Impudent forgeries were received as authentic
monuments of antiquity: And the champions of holy
church, if &s;ucce&s;sful, were celebrated as heroes; if un|fortunate,
were wor&s;hiped as martyrs; and all events
thus turned out equally to the advantage of clerical u&s;ur|pations.
Pa&s;cal him&s;elf, the pre&s;ent Pope, was, in the
cour&s;e of this very controver&s;y concerning inve&s;titures,
involved in circum&s;tances, and nece&s;&s;itated to follow a
conduct, which would have drawn di&s;grace and ruin on
any temporal prince, that had been &s;o unfortunate as to
fall into a like &s;ituation. His per&s;on was &s;eized by the
Emperor Henry V. and he was obliged, by a formal
treaty, to re&s;ign to that monarch the right of granting
inve&s;titures, for which they had &s;o long contended<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 167.</NOTE>. In
order to add greater &s;olemnity to this agreement, the
Emperor and Pope communicated together on the &s;ame
ho&s;te; one half of which was given to the prince, the
other taken by the pontiff: The mo&s;t tremendous im|precations
were publicly denounced on either of them
who &s;hould violate the treaty: Yet no &s;ooner did Pa&s;cal
recover his liberty, than he recalled all his conce&s;&s;ions,
and pronounced the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t
the Emperor, who, in the end, was obliged to &s;ubmit
to the terms required of him, and to yield up all his pre|ten&s;ions,
which he could never recall<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Padre Paolo &s;opra benef. eccle&s;. p. 112. W. Malme&s;. p. 170. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 63. Sim. Dunelm. p. 233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="389">
THE King of England had very nearly fallen into the
&s;ame dangerous &s;ituation: Pa&s;cal had already excommu|nicated
the earl of Meulent, and the other mini&s;ters of
Henry, who were in&s;trumental in &s;upporting his preten|&s;ions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 79.</NOTE>:
He daily menaced the King him&s;elf with a like
&s;entence; and he &s;u&s;pended the blow only to give him
lei&s;ure to e&s;cape it by a timely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The male|contents
waited impatiently for the opportunity of di&s;|turbing
his government by con&s;piracies and in&s;urrec|tions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 80.</NOTE>:
The King's greate&s;t friends were anxious at the
pro&s;pect of an incident, which would &s;et their religious
and civil duties at variance with each other: And the
counte&s;s of Blois, his &s;i&s;ter, a prince&s;s of piety, who had
great influence over him, was affrighted with the danger
of her brother's eternal damnation<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 79.</NOTE>. Henry, on the
other hand, &s;eemed determined to run all hazards, rather
than re&s;ign a prerogative of &s;uch importance, which had
been enjoyed by all his predece&s;&s;ors; and it &s;eemed pro|bable,
from his great prudence and ability, that he
might be able to &s;u&s;tain his rights, and finally prevail in
the conte&s;t. While Pa&s;cal and Henry thus &s;tood mu|tually
in awe of each other, it was the more ea&s;y to
bring about an accommodation between them, and to
find a medium, in which they might both agree.</P>
<P>BEFORE bi&s;hops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their dignities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compromi&s;e with An&s;elm.</NOTE> they
had formerly been accu&s;tomed to pa&s;s thro' two ceremo|nials:
They received from the hands of the &s;overeign a
ring and cro&s;ier, as &s;ymbols of their office; and this was
called their <HI>inve&s;titure:</HI> They al&s;o made tho&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions
to the prince, required of va&s;&s;als by the rites of the
feudal law, which received the name of <HI>homage.</HI> And
as the King might refu&s;e both to grant the <HI>inve&s;titure</HI>
and to receive the <HI>homage,</HI> tho' the chapter had, by &s;ome
<PB N="356" REF="390">
canons of the middle age, been endowed with the right
of election, the &s;overeign had in reality the &s;ole power
of appointing prelates. Urban II. had equally deprived
laymen of the rights of granting inve&s;titure and of re|ceiving homage<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 91. W. Malm. p. 163. Sim. Dunelm. p. 230.</NOTE>: The Emperors never were able, by
all their wars and negotiations, to make any di&s;tinction
be admitted between them: The interpo&s;ition of pro|fane
laymen, in any particular, was &s;till repre&s;ented as
impious and abominable: And the church openly a&s;pired
to a total independance on the &s;tate. But Henry had
put England, as well as Normandy, in &s;uch a &s;ituation
as gave greater weight to his negotiations; and Pa&s;cal
was for the pre&s;ent contented with his re&s;igning the right
of granting inve&s;titures, by which the &s;piritual dignity
was &s;uppo&s;ed to be conferred; and he allowed the bi&s;hops
to do homage for their temporal properties and privi|leges<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 91. W. Malm. p. 164. 227. Hoveden, p. 471. M. Paris, p. 43. T. Rudh. p. 274. Brompton, p. 1000. Wilkins, p. 303. Chron. Dun&s;t. p. 21.</NOTE>.
The pontiff was well plea&s;ed to have made this
acqui&s;ition, which, he hoped, would in time involve the
whole: And the King, anxious to procure an e&s;cape
from a very dangerous &s;ituation, was contented to re|tain
&s;ome, tho' a more precarious authority, in the elec|tion
of prelates.</P>
<P>AFTER the principal controver&s;y was accommodated,
it was not difficult to adju&s;t the other differences. The
Pope allowed An&s;elm to communicate with the prelates,
who had already received inve&s;titures from the crown;
and he only required of them &s;ome &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions for their
pa&s;t, mi&s;conduct<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 87.</NOTE>. He al&s;o granted An&s;elm a plenary
power of remedying every other di&s;order, which, he &s;aid,
might ari&s;e from the barbarou&s;ne&s;s of the country<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 91.</NOTE>.
Such was the idea which the Popes then entertained of
<PB N="357" REF="391">
the Engli&s;h; and nothing can be a &s;tronger proof of the
mi&s;erable ignorance in which that people were then
plunged, than that a man, who &s;at on the papal throne,
and who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by ab&s;urdities and non&s;en&s;e, &s;hould
think him&s;elf intitled to treat them as barbarians.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of the&s;e controver&s;ies, a &s;ynod was
held at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where the King, intent only on
the main di&s;pute, allowed &s;ome canons of le&s;s con&s;e|quence
to be enacted, which tended to promote the u&s;ur|pations
of the clergy. The marriage of prie&s;ts was pro|hibited;
a point which it was &s;till found very difficult to
carry into execution: And even laymen were not al|lowed
to marry within the &s;eventh degree of affinity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 67, 68. Spelm. Conc. vol. ii. p. 22.</NOTE>.
By this contrivance, the Pope augmented the profits,
which he reaped from granting di&s;pen&s;ations; and like|wi&s;e
tho&s;e from divorces. For as the art of writing was
then rare, and pari&s;h regi&s;ters were not then regularly
kept, it was not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the degrees of affinity
even among people of rank; and any man, who had
money &s;ufficient to pay for it, might obtain a divorce,
on pretence that his wife was more nearly related to
him than was permitted by the canons. The &s;ynod al&s;o
pa&s;&s;ed a vote, prohibiting the laity to wear long hair<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 68.</NOTE>.
The aver&s;ion of the clergy to this mode was not con|fined
to England. When the King went over to Nor|mandy,
before he had conquered that province, the
bi&s;hop of Seez, in a formal harangue, earne&s;tly applied
to him to redre&s;s the manifold di&s;orders under which the
government laboured, and to oblige the people to poll
their hair in a decent form. Henry, tho' he would not
re&s;ign his prerogatives to the church, was very willing
to part with his hair: He cut it in the form which they
<PB N="358" REF="392">
required of him, and obliged all the courtiers to imitate
his example<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 816.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE acqui&s;ition of Normandy was a great point of
Henry's ambition; being the antient patrimony of his
family, and the only territory, which, while in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
gave him any weight or con&s;ideration on the con|tinent:
But the inju&s;tice of his u&s;urpation was the
&s;ource of great inquietude, involved him in frequent
wars, and obliged him to impo&s;e on his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects
tho&s;e many heavy and arbitrary taxes, of which all the
hi&s;torians of that age unanimou&s;ly complain<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 83. Chron. Sax. p. 211, 212, 213. 219, 220, 228. H. Hunt. p. 380. Hoveden, p. 470. Ann. Waverl. p. 143.</NOTE>. His ne|phew,
William, was but &s;ix years of age, when he
committed him to the care of Helie de St. Saen; and it
is probable, that his rea&s;on for intru&s;ting that important
charge to a man of &s;uch an unblemi&s;hed character, was
to prevent all malignant &s;u&s;picions, in ca&s;e any accident
&s;hould be$al the life of the young prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1110.</NOTE> He &s;oon re|pented him of this choice; but when he de&s;ired to re|cover
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of William's per&s;on, Helie withdrew
his pupil, and carried him to the court of Fulk, count
of Anjou, who gave him protection<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 837.</NOTE>. In proportion
as the young prince grew up to man's e&s;tate, he di&s;|covered
virtues &s;uitable to his birth; and wandering
thro' different courts of Europe, excited the friendly
compa&s;&s;ion of many princes, and rai&s;ed a general indig|nation
again&s;t his uncle, who had &s;o unju&s;tly bereaved
him of his inheritance. Lewis the Gro&s;s, &s;on of Philip,
was at this time King of France, a brave and generous
prince, who having been obliged, during the lifetime of
his father, to fly into England, in order to e&s;cape the
per&s;ecutions of his &s;tepmother, Bertrude, had been pro|tected
<PB N="359" REF="393">
by Henry, and had thence conceived a per&s;onal
friend&s;hip for him. But the&s;e ties were &s;oon di&s;&s;olved
after the acce&s;&s;ion of Lewis, who found his intere&s;ts to
be in &s;o many particulars oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of the Eng|li&s;h
monarch, and who became &s;en&s;ible of the danger
attending the annexation of Normandy to England. He
joined, therefore, the counts of Anjou and Flanders
in giving di&s;quiet to Henry's government; and this mo|narch,
in order to defend his foreign dominions, found
him&s;elf obliged to go over to Normandy, where he re|&s;ided
two years. The war which en&s;ued among the&s;e
princes was attended with no memorable tran&s;action,
and produced only &s;light &s;kirmi&s;hes on the frontiers,
agreeable to the weak condition of the &s;overeigns in that
age, whenever their &s;ubjects were not rouzed by &s;ome
great and urgent occa&s;ion. Henry, by contracting his
elde&s;t &s;on, William, to the daughter of Fulk<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 221. W. Malm. p. 160. Knyghton, p. 2380.</NOTE>, detached
that prince from the alliance, and obliged the others to
come to an accommodation with him. This peace was
not of long duration. His nephew, William, retired to
the court of Baldwin, earl of Flanders, who e&s;pou&s;ed
his cau&s;e; and the King of France, having &s;oon after,
for other rea&s;ons, joined the party, a new war was
kindled in Normandy, which produced no event more
memorable than had attended the former.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1118.</NOTE> At la&s;t the
death of Baldwin, who was &s;lain in an action near Eu,
gave &s;ome re&s;pite to Henry, and enabled him to carry

<P>LEWIS, finding him&s;elf unable to wre&s;t Normandy
from the King by force of arms, had recour&s;e to the
dangerous expedient, of applying to the &s;piritual power,
and of affording the eccle&s;ia&s;tics a pretence to interpo&s;e
<PB N="360" REF="394">
in the temporal intere&s;ts of princes. He carried young
William to a general council, which was a&s;&s;embled at
Rheims by Pope Calixtus II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1119.</NOTE> pre&s;ented the Norman
prince to them, complained of the manife&s;t u&s;urpation
and inju&s;tice of Henry, craved the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
church for rein&s;tating the true heir in his dominions,
and repre&s;ented the enormity of detaining in pri&s;on &s;o
brave a prince as Robert, one of the mo&s;t eminent cham|pions
of the cro&s;s, and who by that very quality was
placed under the immediate protection of the holy &s;ee<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 858.</NOTE>.
Henry knew how to defend the rights of his crown with
vigour, and yet with dexterity. He had &s;ent over the
Engli&s;h bi&s;hops to this &s;ynod; but at the &s;ame time had
warned them, that, if any farther claims were &s;tarted
by the Pope or the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, he was determined to
adhere to the laws and cu&s;toms of England, and main|tain
the prerogatives tran&s;mitted to him by his ance&s;tors.
&startq;Go,&endq; &s;aid he to them, &startq;&s;alute the Pope in my name,
hear his apo&s;tolical precepts; but take care to bring
none of his new inventions into my kingdom.&endq; Find|ing,
however, that it would be ea&s;ier for him to elude
than oppo&s;e the efforts of Calixtus, he gave his am|ba&s;&s;adors
orders to gain the Pope and his favourites by
liberal pre&s;ents and promi&s;es. The complaints of the
Norman prince were thenceforth heard with great cold|ne&s;s
by the council; and Calixtus confe&s;&s;ed, after a
conference, which he had the &s;ame &s;ummer with Henry,
that, of all men, whom he had ever yet been acquaint|ed
with, he was beyond compari&s;on the mo&s;t eloquent
and per&s;ua&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE warlike mea&s;ures of Lewis proved as meffectual
as his intrigues. He had laid a &s;cheme for &s;urprizing
Noyon; but Henry, having received intelligence of the
de&s;ign, marched to the relief of the place, and &s;uddenly
<PB N="361" REF="395">
attacked the French at Andeley, as they were advanc|ing
to Noyon. A &s;harp action en&s;ued; where William,
the &s;on of Robert, behaved with great bravery, and the
King him&s;elf was in the mo&s;t imminent danger. He
was wounded in the head by Cri&s;pin, a gallant Norman
officer, who had followed the fortunes of William<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 381. M. Paris, p. 47. Diceto, p. 503. Bromp|ton, p. 1007. M. We&s;t, p. 239.</NOTE>;
but being rather animated than terrified by the blow,
he immediately beat his antagoni&s;t to the ground, and &s;o
encouraged his troops by the example, that they put the
French to total rout, and had very nearly taken their
King pri&s;oner. The dignity of the per&s;ons, engaged in
this &s;kirmi&s;h, rendered it the mo&s;t memorable action of
the war: For in other re&s;pects, it was not of great im|portance.
There were nine hundred hor&s;emen, who
fought on both &s;ides; yet were there only three per&s;ons
&s;lain. The re&s;t were defended by that heavy armour,
worn by the cavalry in tho&s;e times<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 854.</NOTE>. An accommoda|tion
&s;oon after en&s;ued between the Kings of France
and England; and the intere&s;ts of young William were
entirely neglected in it.</P>

But it is remarkable, that the young prince had en|tertained
a violent aver&s;ion to the natives; and had been
heard to threaten, that, when he &s;hould be King, he
<PB N="363" REF="397">
would make them draw the plough, and would turn
them into bea&s;ts of burthen. The&s;e prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions he in|herited
from his father, who, tho' he was wont, when it
might &s;erve his purpo&s;es, to value him&s;elf on his birth,
as a native of England<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neub. lib. $word$ cap. 3.</NOTE>, &s;howed, in the cour&s;e of his
government, an extreme prejudice again&s;t that people.
All hopes of preferment, to eccle&s;ia&s;tical as well as civil
dignities, were denied them during this whole reign;
and any foreigner, however ignorant or worthle&s;s, was
&s;ure to have the preference in every competition<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eadmer. p. 110.</NOTE>. As
the Engli&s;h had given no di&s;turbance to the government
during the cour&s;e of fifty years, this inveterate antipa|thy,
in a prince of &s;o much temper as well as penetra|tion,
forms a pre&s;umption that the Engli&s;h of that age
were &s;till a rude and barbarous people even compared
to the Normans, and impre&s;&s;es us with no very favour|able
idea of the Anglo-Saxon manners.</P>
<P>PRINCE William left no children; and the King had
not now any legitimate i&s;&s;ue; except one daughter, Ma|tilda,
whom, in 1110, he had betrothed, tho' only eight
years of age<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 215. W. Malm. p. 166. Order. Vital. p. 838.</NOTE>, to the Emperor Henry V. and whom he
had then &s;ent over to be educated in Germany<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Henry, by the feudal cu&s;toms, was intitled to levy a tax for the marrying his elde&s;t daughter, and he exacted three &s;hillings a hyde on all England. H. Hunt. p. 379. Some hi&s;torians (as Brady, p. 270. and Tyrrel, vol. ii. p. 182.) heedle&s;sly make this &s;um amount to above 800,000 pounds of our pre&s;ent money: But it could not exceed 135,000. Five hydes, &s;ometimes le&s;s, made a knight's &s;ee, of which there were about 60,000 in England, con&s;equently near 300,000 hydes; and at the rate of three &s;hillings a hyde, the &s;um would amount to 45,000 pounds, or 135,000 of our pre&s;ent money. See Rudborne, p. 257. In the Saxon times, there were only computed 243,600 hydes in Eng|land.</NOTE>. But
as her ab&s;ence from the kingdom, and her marriage into
a foreign family, might endanger the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, Henry,
<PB N="364" REF="398">
who was now a widower, was induced to marry in hopes
of having &s;ons; and he made his addre&s;&s;es to Adelais,
daughter of Godfrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's &s;econd marriage.</NOTE> duke of Lovaine, and niece to
Pope Calixtus, a young prince&s;s of an amiable per&s;on<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 223. W. Malm. p. 165.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1121.</NOTE>
But Adelais brought him no children; and the prince,
who was mo&s;t likely to di&s;pute the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and even
the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, recovered hopes
of &s;ubverting his rival, who had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;eized all
his patrimonial dominions. William, the &s;on of duke
Robert, was &s;till protected in the court of Lewis, King
of France; and as Henry's connections with Fulk, count
of Anjou, were broke off by the death of his &s;on, that
count joined the party of the unfortunate prince, gave
him his daughter in marriage, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in rai&s;ing
di&s;turbances in Normandy. But Henry found the means
of drawing off the count of Anjou, by forming anew
with him a nearer connexion than the former, and one
more material to the intere&s;ts of his family.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1127.</NOTE> The Em|peror,
his &s;on-in-law, dying without i&s;&s;ue, he be&s;towed
his daughter on Geoffrey, the elde&s;t &s;on of Fulk, and
endeavoured to en&s;ure her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by having her re|cognized
heir of all his dominions, and obliging the
barons both of Normandy and England to &s;wear fealty
to her<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 230. W. Malm. p. 175. Gul. Gemet. p. 304. Chron. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 68.</NOTE>. He hoped, that the choice of this hu&s;band
would be more agreeable to all his &s;ubjects than that
of the Emperor; as &s;ecuring them from the fears of fall|ing
under the dominion of a great and di&s;tant potentate,
who might bring them into &s;ubjection, and reduce their
country to the rank of a province: But the barons were
di&s;plea&s;ed, that a &s;tep &s;o material to national intere&s;ts
had been taken without con&s;ulting them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 175. The annals of Waverly, p. 150. &s;ay, that the King a&s;ked and obtained the con&s;ent of all the barons.</NOTE>; and Henry
<PB N="365" REF="399">
had experienced too &s;en&s;ibly the turbulency of their di&s;|po&s;ition, not to dread the effects of their re&s;entment. It
&s;eemed probable, that his nephew's party might gain
force from the increa&s;e of the malecontents; and an acce&s;|&s;ion
of power, which that prince inherited a little after,
tended to render his preten&s;ions &s;till more dangerous.
Charles earl of Flanders being a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated during the
celebration of divine &s;ervice, King Lewis immediately
put the young prince in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that county, to
which he had preten&s;ions, in the right of his grandmother
Matilda, wife to the Conqueror<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 231: Gul. Gem. p. 299. Alur. Beverl. p. 151.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1128.</NOTE> But William &s;urviv|ed
a very little time this piece of good fortune, which
&s;eemed to open the door to &s;till farther pro&s;perity. He
was killed in a &s;kirmi&s;h with the landgrave of Al&s;ace,
his competitor for Flanders; and his death put an end,
for the pre&s;ent, to the jealou&s;y and inquietude of Henry<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE chief merit of this prince's government con&s;i&s;ts
in the profound tranquillity which he e&s;tabli&s;hed and
maintained throughout all his dominions during the great|e&s;t
part of his reign<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. p. 302.</NOTE>. The mutinous barons were re|tained
in &s;ubjection; and his neighbours, in every attempt
which they made upon him, found him &s;o well prepared,
that they were di&s;couraged from continuing or renewing
their enterprizes. In order to repre&s;s the incur&s;ions of
the Wel&s;h, he brought over &s;ome Flemings in the year
1111, and &s;ettled them in Pembroke&s;hire, where they
long maintained a different language, and cu&s;toms and
manners, from their neighbours<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 158. Brompton, p. 1003.</NOTE>. Tho' his government
&s;eems to have been arbitrary in England, it was judicious
and prudent; and was as little oppre&s;&s;ive as the nece&s;&s;ity
of his affairs would permit. He wanted not attention to
the redre&s;s of grievances; and hi&s;torians mention in par|ticular
<PB N="366" REF="400">
the levying purveyance, which he endeavoured to
moderate and re&s;train. The tenants in the King's de|me&s;ne
lands were at that time obliged to &s;upply <HI>gratis</HI>
the court with provi&s;ions, and to furni&s;h carriages on the
&s;ame hard terms, when the King made a progre&s;s into
any of the counties. The&s;e exactions were &s;o grievous,
and levied in &s;o licentious a manner, that the farmers,
when they heard of the court's approach, often de&s;erted
their homes, as if an enemy had invaded them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 94. Chron. Sax. p&punc; 212.</NOTE>; and
&s;heltered their per&s;ons and families in the woods from the
in&s;ults of the King's retinue. Henry prohibited the&s;e
enormities, and puni&s;hed the per&s;ons guilty of them by
cutting off their hands, legs, or other members<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 94.</NOTE>. But
the prerogative was perpetual; the remedy applied by
Henry was but temporary; and the violence of this remedy,
&s;o far from being a &s;ecurity to the people, was only a
proof of the ferocity of the government in that age,
and threatened a quick return of like abu&s;es.</P>
<P>ONE great and difficult object of the King's prudence
was the guarding again&s;t the incroachments of the court
of Rome, and protecting the liberties of the church of
England. The Pope, in the year 1101, had &s;ent Guy,
archbi&s;hop of Vienne, as legate into Britain; and tho'
he was the fir&s;t that for many years had appeared there in
that character, and his commi&s;&s;ion gave general &s;urprize<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 58.</NOTE>,
the King, who was then in the commencement of his
reign, and was attended with many difficulties, was
obliged to &s;ubmit to this incroachment on his authority.
But in the year 1116, An&s;elm, abbot of St. Sabas, who
was coming over with a like legatine commi&s;&s;ion, was
prohibited to enter the kingdom<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 474.</NOTE>; and Pope Calixtus,
<PB N="367" REF="401">
who in his turn was then labouring under many diffi|culties,
by rea&s;on of the preten&s;ions of Gregory, an
anti-pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1128.</NOTE> was obliged to promi&s;e, that he never would
for the future, except when &s;olicited by the King him|&s;elf,
&s;end any legate into England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eadmer, p. 125. 137, 138.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding
this engagement, the Pope, &s;o &s;oon as he had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
his antagoni&s;t, granted the Cardinal de Crema a lega|tine
commi&s;&s;ion for that kingdom; and the King, who,
by &amp; rea&s;on of his nephew's intrigues and inva&s;ions, found
him&s;elf at that time in a dangerous &s;ituation, was obliged
to &s;ubmit to the exerci&s;e of this commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 229.</NOTE>. A &s;ynod
was called by the legate at London; where, among other
canons, a vote pa&s;&s;ed, enacting &s;evere penalties on the
marriage of the clergy<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Spelm. Conc. vol. ii. p. 34.</NOTE>; and the Cardinal, in a public
harangue, declared it to be an unpardonable enormity,
that a prie&s;t &s;hould dare to con&s;ecrate and touch the body
of Chri&s;t immediately after he had ri&s;en from the &s;ide of
a &s;trumpet: For that was the decent appellation which
he gave to the wives of the clergy. But it happened,
that, the very next night, the officers of ju&s;tice, break|ing
into a di&s;orderly hou&s;e, found the Cardinal in bed
with a courtezan<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 478. M. Paris, p. 48. Matth. We&s;t. ad ann. 1125. H. Huntingdon, p. 382. It is remarkable, that this la&s;t wri|ter, who was a clergyman as well as the others, makes an apology for u&s;ing &s;uch freedom with the fathers of the church; but &s;ays, that the fact was notorious, and ought not to be concealed.</NOTE>; an incident which threw &s;uch a ridi|cule
on him, that he immediately &s;tole out of the king|dom:
The &s;ynod broke up; and the canons again&s;t the
marriage of clergymen were wor&s;e executed than ever<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 234.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to prevent this alternate revolution
of conce&s;&s;ions and encroachments, &s;ent William, then
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, to remon&s;trate with the court
<PB N="368" REF="402">
of Rome again&s;t the&s;e abu&s;es, and to a&s;&s;ert the liberties
of the Engli&s;h churches. It was an u&s;ual maxim with
every Pope, when he found that he could not prevail in
any preten&s;ion, to grant princes or &s;tates a power which
they had always exerci&s;ed, to re&s;ume at a proper &s;ea&s;on
the claim which &s;eemed to be re&s;igned, and to pretend,
that the civil magi&s;trate had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the authority only
from a &s;pecial indulgence of the Roman pontiff. After
this manner, the Pope, finding that the French nation
would not admit his claim of granting inve&s;titures, had
pa&s;&s;ed a bull, giving the King that authority; and he
now practi&s;ed a like invention to elude the complaints of the King of England. He made the archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury
his legate, renewed his commi&s;&s;ion from time to
time, and &s;till pretended, that the rights, which that
prelate had ever exerci&s;ed as metropolitan, were entirely
derived from the indulgence of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee. The
Engli&s;h princes, and Henry in particular, who were glad
to avoid any pre&s;ent conte&s;t of &s;o dangerous a nature,
commonly acquie&s;ced by their &s;ilence in the&s;e preten&s;ions
of the court of Rome<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The legates <HI>a latere,</HI> as they were called, were a kind of dele|gates, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the full power of the Pope in all the provinces committed to their charge, and were very bu&s;y in extending, as well as exerci&s;ing it. They nominated to all vacant benefices, a&s;&s;embled &s;ynods, and were anxious to maintain eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, which never could be fully protected without incroachments on the civil power. If there was the lea&s;t concurrence or oppo&s;ition, it was always &s;uppo&s;ed that the civil power was to give way: Every deed, which had the lea&s;t pre|tence of holding of any thing &s;piritual, as marriages, te&s;taments, pro|mi&s;&s;ory oaths, were brought into the &s;piritual court, and could not be canva&s;&s;ed before a civil magi&s;trate. The&s;e were the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the church; and where a legate was &s;ent immediately from Rome, he was &s;ure to maintain the papal claims with the utmo&s;t rigour: But it was an advantage to the King to have the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury ap|pointed legate, becau&s;e the connexions of that prelate with the kingdom tended to moderate his mea&s;ures.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="403">
As every thing in England remained in the utmo&s;t
tranquillity, Henry took the opportunity of paying a
vi&s;it to Normandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1131.</NOTE> to which he was invited, as well by
his affection for that country, as by his tenderne&s;s for
his daughter the Empre&s;s, Matilda, who was always his
favourite.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1133.</NOTE> Some time after, that prince&s;s was delivered
of a &s;on, who received the name of Henry; and the
King, farther to en&s;ure her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, made all the nobi|lity
of England and Normandy renew the oath of fealty,
which they had already &s;worn to her<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 177.</NOTE>. The joy of this
event, and the &s;atisfaction which he reaped from his
daughter's company, who bore &s;ucce&s;&s;ively two other
&s;ons, made his re&s;idence in Normandy very agreeable to
him<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 315.</NOTE>; and he &s;eemed determined to pa&s;s the re&s;t of his
days in that country; when an incur&s;ion of the Wel&s;h
obliged him to think of returning into England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1135.</NOTE> He
was preparing for the journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t of Dec.</NOTE> when he was &s;eized with
a &s;udden illne&s;s at St. Denis le Forment, from eating too
plentifully of lampreys, a food which always agreed
better with his palate than his con&s;titution<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 385. M. Paris, p. 50.</NOTE>. He died
in the &s;ixty-&s;eventh year of his age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE> and the thirty-fifth
of his reign; leaving by will his daughter, Matilda,
heire&s;s of all his dominions, without making any men|tion

cau&s;es of di&s;plea&s;ure<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 178.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS prince was one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed that
has filled the Engli&s;h throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and cha|racter of Henry.</NOTE> and pro&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the quali|ties
both of body and mind, natural and acquired, which
could fit him for the high &s;tation, to which he attained.
His per&s;on was manly, his countenance engaging, his
eyes clear, &s;erene, and penetrating. The affability
of his addre&s;s encouraged tho&s;e who might be overawed
by the &s;en&s;e of his dignity or of his wi&s;dom; and tho' he
<PB N="370" REF="404">
often indulged his facetious humour, he knew how to
temper it with di&s;cretion, and ever kept at a di&s;tance
from all indecent familiarities with his courtiers. His
&s;uperior eloquence and judgment would have given him
an a&s;cendant even had he been born in a private &s;tation;
and his per&s;onal bravery would have procured him re&s;pect,
even tho' it had been le&s;s &s;upported by art and policy.
By his great progre&s;s in literature, he acquired the name
of <HI>Beau-clerc</HI> or the &s;cholar; but his application to the&s;e
&s;edentary pur&s;uits abated nothing of the activity and vigi|lance
of his government; and tho' the learning of that
age was better fitted to corrupt than improve the under|&s;tanding,
his natural good &s;en&s;e pre&s;erved it&s;elf untainted
both from the pedantry and &s;uper&s;tition, which were
then &s;o prevalent among men of letters. His temper
was very &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;entiments as well of friend|&s;hip
as of re&s;entment<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital. p. 805.</NOTE>; and his ambition, tho' high,
might be e&s;teemed moderate and rea&s;onable; had not
his conduct towards his brother and nephew &s;howed
that he was too much di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice to it all the
maxims of ju&s;tice and equity. But the total incapacity
of Robert for government afforded his younger brother
a rea&s;on or pretence for &s;eizing the &s;cepter both of Nor|mandy
and England; and when violence and u&s;urpation
are once begun, nece&s;&s;ity obliges a prince to continue in
the &s;ame criminal cour&s;e, and engages him in mea&s;ures,
which his better judgment and &s;ounder principles would
otherwi&s;e have induced him to reject with warmth and
indignation.</P>
<P>KING Henry was much addicted to women; and hi&s;to|rians
mention no le&s;s than &s;even illegitimate &s;ons and &s;ix
daughters, who were born to him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gul. Gemet. lib. 8. cap. 29.</NOTE>. Hunting was al&s;o
one of his favourite amu&s;ements; and he exerci&s;ed great
<PB N="371" REF="405">
rigour on tho&s;e who encroached on the royal fore&s;ts,
which were augmented during this reign<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 179.</NOTE>, tho' their
number and extent were already enormous. To kill a
&s;tag was as criminal as to murder a man: He made all
the dogs be mutilated, which were kept on the borders
of his fore&s;ts: And he &s;ometimes deprived his &s;ubjects of
the liberty of hunting on their own lands, or even cut|ting
their own woods. In other re&s;pects, he executed
ju&s;tice, and that with rigour; the be&s;t maxim which a
prince in that age could follow. Stealing was fir&s;t made
capital in this reign<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sim. Dunelm. p. 231. Brompton, p. 1000. Flor. Wigorn. p. 653. Hoveden, p. 471.</NOTE>: Fal&s;e coining, which was then

fifty criminals of this kind were at one time hanged or
mutilated; and tho' the&s;e puni&s;hments &s;eem to have
been exerci&s;ed in &s;omewhat an arbitrary manner, they
were grateful to the people, more attentive to pre&s;ent
advantages, than jealous of general laws. There is a
code, which pa&s;&s;es under the name of Henry I. but the
be&s;t antiquarians have agreed not to think it genuine.
It is however a very antient compilation, and may be u&s;e|ful
to in&s;truct us in the manners and cu&s;toms of the times.
It appears from it, that a great di&s;tinction was then made
between the Engli&s;h and Normans, much to the advan|tage
of the latter<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">LL. Hen. 1. &sect; 18. 75.</NOTE>. The deadly feuds and the liberty of

and the &s;ame revolution of principles,

to leave the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion open, without a rival, to the em|pre&s;s,
Matilda; and as Henry had made all his va&s;&s;als in

capable of adhering to a &s;trict rule of government; and
as every precedent of this kind &s;eems to give authority
to new u&s;urpations, he had rea&s;on to dread, even from
his own family, &s;ome inva&s;ion of his daughter's title,
which he had taken &s;uch pains to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>ADELA, daughter of William the Conqueror, had
been married to Stephen, count of Blois, and had brought
him &s;everal &s;ons; among whom, Stephen, and Henry,
the two young&s;t, had been invited over to England by
the late King, and had received great honours, riches,
and preferment from the zealous friend&s;hip, which that
prince bore to every one, that had been &s;o fortunate as to
acquire his favour and good opinion. Henry, who had
betaken him&s;elf to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical profe&s;&s;ion, was created
abbot of Gla&s;tenbury and bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; and
tho' the&s;e dignities were con&s;iderable, Stephen, his bro|ther,
had, from his uncle's liberality, attained e&s;tabli&s;h|ments
&s;till more &s;olid and durable<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gul. Newbr. p. 360. Brompton, p. 1023.</NOTE>. The King had
married him to Matilda, who was daughter and heir of
Eu&s;tace count of Boulogne, and who brought him, be|&s;ides
that feudal &s;overeignty in France, an immen&s;e pro|perty
in England, which, in the di&s;tribution of lands,
had been conferred by the Conqueror on the family of
Boulogne. Stephen al&s;o by this marriage acquired a
new connexion with the royal family of England; as
Mary, his wife's mother, was &s;i&s;ter to David, the pre&s;ent
King of Scotland, and to Matilda, the fir&s;t wife of
Henry, and mother of the empre&s;s. The King, &s;till
imagining, that he &s;trengthened the intere&s;ts of his fa|mily
by the aggrandizement of Stephen, took a plea&s;ure
in enriching him by the grant of new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and
<PB N="375" REF="409">
he conferred on him the great e&s;tate forfeited by Robert
Mallet in England, and that forfeited by the earl of
Mortaigne m Normandy. Stephen, in return, profe&s;|fed
a great attachment to his uncle; and appeared &s;o zeal|ous
for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Matilda, that when the barons
&s;wore fealty to that prince&s;s, he contended with Robert,
earl of Gloce&s;ter, the King's natural &s;on, who &s;hould
fir&s;t be admitted to give her this te&s;timony of devoted
zeal and fidelity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 192.</NOTE>. Meanwhile, he continued to cul|tivate,
by every art of popularity, the friend&s;hip and
affection of the English nation; and many virtues, with
which he &s;eemed to be endowed, favoured the &s;ucce&s;s
of his intentions. By his bravery, activity arid vigor, he
acquired the e&s;teem of the barons: By his generosity, and
by an affable and familiar addre&s;s, unu&s;ual in that age
among men of his high quality, he obtained the affections
of the people, particularly the Londoners<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 179. Ge&s;t. Steph. p 928.</NOTE>. And tho'
he dared not to take any &s;teps towards his farther gran|deur,
le&s;t he might expo&s;e him&s;elf to the jealou&s;y of &s;o
penetrating a prince as Henry; he &s;till hoped, that, by
accumulating riches and power, and by acquiring popu|larity,
he might &s;ome time be able to open his way to the
throne.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Henry expired, than Stephen, in&s;en|&s;ible
to all the ties of g$atitude and fidelity, and blind to
danger, gave full reins to his criminal ambition, and
tru&s;ted, that, even without any previous intrigue, the ce|lerity
of his enterprize and the boldne&s;s of his attempt
might overcome the weak attachment, which the Eng|li&s;h
and Normans in that age bore to the laws, and to
the rights of their &s;overeign. He ha&s;tened over to Eng|land;
and tho' the citizens of Dover, and tho&s;e of Can|terbury,
apprized of his purpo&s;e, &s;hut their gates again&s;t
him, he &s;topped not till he arrived at London, where
<PB N="376" REF="410">
&s;ome of the lower rank, in&s;tigated by his emi&s;&s;aries, as
well as moved by his general popularity, immediately
&s;aluted him King. His next point was to acquire the
good will of the clergy; and by performing the ceremony
of his coronation, put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne,
from which, he was confident, it would not be ea&s;y af|terwards
to expel him. His brother, the bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter,
was u&s;eful to him in the&s;e capital articles; and
having gained Roger, bi&s;hop of Salisbury<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">H. Hunt. p. 386. Gul. Neubr. p. 360. 362. Ann. Waverl. p. 152.</NOTE>, who, tho'
he owed a great fortune and advancement to the favour
of the late king, pre&s;erved no &s;en&s;e of gratitude to that
prince's family, he applied, in conjunction with that
prelate, to William, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and re|quired
him, in virtue of his office, to put the crown upon
the head of Stephen. The primate, who, as well as all
the others, had &s;worn fealty to Matilda, refu&s;ed to per|form
this ceremony<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;t. Steph. p. 929.</NOTE>; but his opposition was overcome
by an expedient equally di&s;honourable with the other
&s;teps, by which this great revolution was effected. Hugh
Bigod, &s;teward of the hou&s;hold, made oath before the
primate, that the late King, on his death-bed, had di&s;|covered
a di&s;&s;atisfaction with his daughter Matilda, and
had expre&s;&s;ed his intention of leaving the count of Bou|logne
heir to all his dominions<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris, p. 51. Diceto, p. 505. Chron. Dun&s;t. p. 23.</NOTE>. William, either be|lieving
or feigning to believe Big$d's te&s;timony, anointed
Stephen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Dec.</NOTE> and put the crown upon his head; and by this
religious ceremony, that prince, without any &s;hadow
either of hereditary title or con&s;ent of the nobility
or people, was allowed to proceed to the exerci&s;e of &s;overeign
authority. Very few barons attended his corona|tion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1023.</NOTE>;
but none oppo&s;ed his u&s;urpation, however unju&s;t
<PB N="377" REF="411">
or flagrant. The &s;entiment of religion, which, if cor|rupted
into &s;uper&s;tition, has often little efficacy in forti|fying
the duties of civil &s;ociety, overlooked the multiplied
oaths, taken in favour of Matilda, and only rendered
the people obedient to a prince, who was countenanced
by the clergy, and who had received from the primate
the rite of royal unction and con&s;ecration<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Such &s;tre&s;s was formerly laid on the rite of coronation, that the monki&s;h writers never give any prince the title of King, till he is crowned; tho' he had for &s;ome time been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, and exerci&s;ed all the powers of Sovereignty.</NOTE>.</P>

&s;peedily fill all vacant benefices, and would never levy

And Stephen, by &s;eizing this money, immediately turned
again&s;t Henry's family, the precaution which that prince
had employed for their grandeur and &s;ecurity: An event,
which naturally attends the policy of ama&s;&s;ing trea&s;ures.
By means of this money, the u&s;urper in&s;ured the com|pliance,
tho' not the attachment, of the principal clergy
and nobility; and not tru&s;ting to this frail &s;ecurity, he
invited over from the continent, particularly from Brit|tanny

Stephen, that he might al&s;o overawe all malecontents
by new and additional terrors of religion, procured a bull
from Rome,, which ratified his title, and which the Pope,

The Norman nobility, moved by an hereditary animo&s;ity

ROBERT, earl of Gloce&s;ter, natural &s;on of the late
King, was a man of honour and ability; and as he was
much attached to the intere&s;ts of his &s;i&s;ter, Matilda, and
zealous for the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, it was
chiefly from his intrigues and re&s;i&s;tance, that the King
had rea&s;on to dread a new revolution of government.
This nobleman, when he received intelligence of Ste|phen's
acce&s;&s;ion, was much embarra&s;&s;ed concerning the
mea&s;ures, which he &s;hould pur&s;ue in that difficult emer|gency.
To &s;wear allegiance to the u&s;urper appeared to
him very di&s;honourable, and a breach of his oath to Ma|tilda:
To refu&s;e giving this pledge of his fidelity was
to bani&s;h him&s;elf from England, and be totally incapa|citated
from &s;erving the royal family, or contributing to
their re&s;toration<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Malme&s;. p. 179.</NOTE>. He offered Stephen to do him ho|mage
and to take the oath of fealty; but with an expre&s;s
condition, that the King &s;hould maintain all his &s;tipu|lations,
and &s;hould never invade any of Robert's rights
or dignities: And Stephen, tho' fen&s;ible, that this re|&s;erve,
&s;o unu&s;ual in it&s;elf, and &s;o unbefitting the duty of
a &s;ubject was meant only to afford Robert a pretence
for a revolt on the fir&s;t favourable opportunity, was
obliged, by the numerous friends and retainers of that
nobleman, to receive him on the&s;e terms<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. M. Paris, p. 51.</NOTE>. The clergy,
who could &s;carce, at this time, be deemed &s;ubjects to the
crown, imitated that dangerous example; and annexed
to their oath of allegiance this condition, that they were
only bound &s;o long as the King defended the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
liberties, and &s;upported the di&s;cipline of the church<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. p. 179.</NOTE>.
The barons, in return for their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, exacted
terms &s;till more de&s;tructive of public peace, as well as
of royal authority: Many of them required the right of
fortifying their ca&s;tles, and of putting them&s;elves in a
<PB N="380" REF="414">
po&s;ture of defence, and the King found him&s;elf totally
unable to refu&s;e his con&s;ent to this exorbitant demand<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Malme&s;. p. 180.</NOTE>.
All England was immediately filled with the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es,
which the noblemen garri&s;oned, either with their va&s;&s;als,
or with licentious &s;oldiers, who flocked to them from all
quarters. Unbounded rapine was exerci&s;ed upon the
people for the maintenance of the&s;e troops; and private
animo&s;ities, which had with difficulty been re&s;trained
by law, now breaking out without controul, rendered
England a &s;cene of uninterrupted violence and deva&s;ta|tion.
Wars between the nobles were carried on with
the utmo&s;t fury in every quarter; the barons even a&s;&s;u|med
the right of coining money, and of exerci&s;ing,
without appeal, every act of juri&s;diction<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 19. Gul. Neubr. p. 372. Chron. Heming. p. 487. Brompton, p. 1035.</NOTE>, and the in|ferior
gentry, as well as the people, finding no defence
from the laws, during this total di&s;&s;olution of &s;overeign
authority, were obliged, for their immediate &s;afety, to
pay court to &s;ome neighbouring chieftain, and to pur|cha&s;e
his protection, both by &s;ubmitting to his exactions,
and by a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in his rapine upon others. The
erection of one ca&s;tle proved the immediate cau&s;e of
building many more; and even tho&s;e, who obtained not
the King's permi&s;&s;ion, thought them&s;elves intitled, by
the great principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, to put them|&s;elves
on an equal footing with their neighbours, who
commonly were al&s;o their enemies and rivals. The
ari&s;tocratical power, which is &s;o tyrannical and oppre&s;|&s;ive
in the feudal governments, had now ri&s;en to its
utmo&s;t height, during the reign of a prince, who, tho'
endowed with vigour and ability, had u&s;urped the throne
without the pretence of a title, and who was nece&s;&s;itated
to tolerate in others the &s;ame violence, to which he him|&s;elf
had been beholden for his &s;overeignty.

BUT Stephen was not of a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ubmit long
to the&s;e u&s;urpations, without making &s;ome efforts for
the recovery of royal authority. Finding that the legal
prerogatives of the crown were re&s;i&s;ted and abridged,
he was al&s;o tempted to make his power the &s;ole mea&s;ure

in ages of &s;uch violence and outrage, it was not
rather advantageous that &s;ome limits were &s;et to the power

employed military power again&s;t their &s;overeign or their

<P>WERE we to relate all the military events tran&s;mitted
to us by contemporary and authentic hi&s;torians, it would
be ea&s;y to &s;well our accounts of this reign into a large
volume; but the&s;e incidents, &s;o little memorable in
them&s;elves, and &s;o confu&s;ed both in time and place,
could afford neither in&s;truction nor entertainment to the
reader. It &s;uffices to &s;ay, that the war was &s;pread into
every quarter; and that tho&s;e turbulent barons, who had
already &s;haken off, in a great mea&s;ure, the re&s;traint of
government, having now obtained the pretence of a pub|lic
cau&s;e, carried on their devastations with redoubled
fury, exerci&s;ed implacable vengeance on each other, and
&s;et no bounds to their oppre&s;&s;ion over the people. The
<PB N="385" REF="419">
ca&s;tles of the nobility were become receptacles of li|cen&s;ed
robbers, who, &s;allying forth day and night, com|mitted
&s;poil on the open country, on the villages, and
even on the cities; put the captives to torture, in order
to make them di&s;cover their trea&s;ures; &s;old their per&s;ons
to &s;lavery; and &s;et fire to the hou&s;es, after they had
pillaged them of every thing valuable. The fiercene&s;s
of their di&s;po&s;ition, leading them to commit wanton de|&s;truction,
fru&s;trated their rapacity of its purpo&s;e; and
the property and per&s;ons even of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, gener|ally
&s;o much revered, were at la&s;t, from nece&s;&s;ity, ex|po&s;ed
to the &s;ame outrage, which had laid wa&s;te the re&s;t
of the kingdom. The land was left untilled; the in|&s;truments
of hu&s;bandry de&s;troyed or abandoned; and a
grievous famine, the natural re&s;ult of the&s;e di&s;orders,
affected equally both parties, and reduced the &s;poilers,
as well as the defencele&s;s peoples to the mo&s;t extreme
want and indigence<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Chron, Sax. p. 238. W. Malme&s;, p. 185. Ge&s;t. Steph. p. 961. M. Paris, p. 53. Gul. Neubr. p. 372. Contin. Flor. Wig. p. 665. Gerva&s;e, p. 1346.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1140</NOTE> &s;everal fruitless negotiations and treaties of

there happened at la&s;t an event, which &s;eemed to

partizans of Matilda, had &s;urprized the ca&s;tle of Lin|coln<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Order. Vital, p. 921.</NOTE>; but the citizens, who were better affected to
Stephen, having invited him to their aid, that prince
laid clo&s;e &s;iege to the ca&s;tle, in hopes of rendering him|&s;elf
&s;oon ma&s;ter of the place, either by a&s;&s;ault or famine.
The earl of Gloce&s;ter ha&s;tened with, an army to the re|life

<P>STEPHEN's party were entirely broke by the captivity of
their leader, and the barons came in daily from all
quarters, and did homage to Matilda. That prince&s;s,
however, amid&s;t all her pro&s;perity, knew, that me was
not &s;ecure of &s;ucce&s;s, unle&s;s &s;he could gain the confi|dence
of the clergy; and as the conduct of the legate
had been of late very ambiguous, and &s;howed his inten|tions
to have rather aimed at humbling his brother,
than totally ruining him, &s;he employed every endeavour
to fix him in her intere&s;ts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d March.</NOTE> She held a conference with
him in an open plain near Winche&s;ter; where &s;he pro|mi&s;ed
upon oath, that if he would acknowledge her for
&s;overeign, would recognize her title as the &s;ole de&s;cend|ant
of the late King, and would return to the allegiance,
which he, as well as the re&s;t of the kingdom, had &s;worn
to her, he &s;hould in return be entire ma&s;ter of the ad|mini&s;tration,
and in particular &s;hould, at his plea&s;ure,
di&s;po&s;e of all vacant bi&s;hoprics and abbies. Earl Robert,
her brother, Brian Fitz-Count, Miles of Gloce&s;ter,
and other great men, became guarantees for her ob&s;erv|ance
of the&s;e engagements<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Malm. p. 187.</NOTE>; and the prelate was at la&s;t
induced to promi&s;e her his allegiance, but that &s;till bur|dened
with the expre&s;s condition, that &s;he &s;hould on her

Winche&s;ter, led her in proce&s;&s;ion to the cathedral, and
with great &s;olemnity, in the pre&s;ence of many bi&s;hops
and abbots, denounced cur&s;es again&s;t all tho&s;e who cur&s;|ed
her, poured out ble&s;&s;ings on tho&s;e who ble&s;&s;ed her,

excommunicated &s;uch as were rebellious<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 242. Contin. Flor. Wig. p. 676.</NOTE>. Theobald,

<P>MATILDA,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matilda crowned.</NOTE> that &s;he might farther en&s;ure the attach|ment
of the clergy, was willing to receive the crown
from their hands; and in&s;tead of a&s;&s;embling the &s;tates of
the kingdom, the mea&s;ure which the con&s;titution, had it
been either fixed or regarded, &s;eemed nece&s;&s;arily to re|quire,
&s;he was contented, that the legate &s;hould &s;ummon
an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council, and that her title to the throne
&s;hould there be recognized and acknowledged. The le|gate,
addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the a&s;&s;embly, told them, that,
in the ab&s;ence of the Empre&s;s, Stephen, his brother, had
been permitted to reign, and, previou&s;ly to his a&s;cending
the throne, had &s;educed them by many fair promi&s;es, of
honouring and exalting the church, of maintaining the
laws, and of reforming all abu&s;es: That it grieved him
to ob&s;erve how much that prince had been in every par|ticular
wanting to his engagements; public peace was
interrupted, crimes were daily committed with impunity,
bi&s;hops were thrown into pri&s;on, and forced to &s;urren|der
their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, abbies were put to &s;ale, churches
were pillaged, and the mo&s;t enormous di&s;orders prevailed
in the admini&s;tration: That he him&s;elf, in order to pro|cure
a redre&s;s of the&s;e grievances, had formerly &s;um|moned
the King before a council of bi&s;hops; but in&s;tead
of inducing him to amend his conduct, had rather of|fended
<PB N="388" REF="422">
him by that expedient: That that prince, however
mi&s;guided, was &s;till his brother, and the object of his af|fections;;
but he mu&s;t however regard his intere&s;ts as
much &s;ubordinate to tho&s;e of his heavenly father, who
had now rejected him, and thrown him into the hands
of his enemies: That it principally belonged to the cler|gy
to elect and ordain Kings; he had &s;ummoned them
together for that purpo&s;e; and having invoked the divine
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he now pronounced Matilda, the only de|&s;cendant
of Henry, their late &s;overeign, Queen of Eng|land.
The whole a&s;&s;embly, by their acclamations or
&s;ilence, gave, or &s;eemed to give, their a&s;&s;ent to this de|claration<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;, p. 188. This author, a judicious man, was pre&s;ent, and &s;ays, that he was very attentive to what pa&s;&s;ed. This &s;peech, therefore, may be regarded as entirely authentic.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE only laymen &s;ummoned to this council, which
decided the fate of the crown, were the Londoners;
and even the&s;e were required, not to give their opinion,
but to &s;ubmit to the decrees of the &s;ynod. The depu|ties
of London, however, were not &s;o pa&s;&s;ive: They
in&s;i&s;ted, that their King &s;hould be delivered from pri&s;on;
but were told by the legate, that it became not the Lon|doners,
who were regarded as noblemen in England, to
take party with tho&s;e barons, who had ba&s;ely for&s;aken
their lord in battle, and who had treated holy church
with contumely<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W. Malme&s;. p. 188.</NOTE>. It is with rea&s;on that the citizens of
London a&s;&s;umed &s;o much authority, if it be true, what
is related by Fitz-Stephen, a contemporary author, that
that city could at that time bring into the field no le&s;s
than 80,000 combatants<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">P. 4. Were this account to be depended on, London mu&s;t at that time have contained near 400,000 inhabitants, which is above double the number it contained at the death of Queen Elizabeth. But the&s;e loo&s;e calculations, or rather gue&s;&s;es, de&s;erve very little credit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="423">
LONDON, notwith&s;tanding its great power, and its
attachment to Stephen, was at la&s;t obliged to &s;ubmit to
Matilda; and her authority, by the prudent conduct of
earl Robert, &s;eemed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed over the whole
kingdom: But affairs remained not long in this &s;itua|tion.
That prince&s;s, be&s;ides the di&s;advantages of her
fex, which weakened her influence over a turbulent and
martial people, was of a pa&s;&s;ionate, imperious &s;pirit<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neubr. 363. Chron. Abb. St. Petri de Burgo, p. 74. Hagul. p. 270.</NOTE>,
and knew not how to temper with affability the har&s;h|ne&s;s
of a refu&s;al. Stephen's Queen, &s;econded by many
of the nobility, petitioned for the liberty of her hu&s;|band;
and offered, that, on that condition, he &s;hould
renounce the crown, and retire into a convent<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Contin. Flor. Wig. p. 677. Brompton, p. 1031.</NOTE>. The
legate de&s;ired, that prince Eu&s;tace, his nephew, might
inherit Boulogne and the other patrimonial e&s;tates of his
father<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>: The Londoners applied for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
King Edward's laws, in&s;tead of tho&s;e of king Henry, which,
they &s;aid, were grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Contin. Flor. Wig. p. 677. Gerva&s;e, p. 1355.</NOTE>. All the&s;e pe|titions
were denied in the mo&s;t haughty and peremptory
manner.</P>
<P>THE legate, who had probably never been &s;incere in
his compliance with Matilda's government, availed him|&s;elf
of the ill humours excited by this imperious con|duct,
and &s;ecretly in&s;tigated the Londoners to a revolt.
A con&s;piracy was entered into to &s;eize the Empre&s;s's
per&s;on; and &s;he &s;aved her&s;elf from the danger by a pre|cipitate
retreat<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 242. W. Malm. p. 189.</NOTE>. She fled to Winche&s;ter; whither the
legate, de&s;irous to &s;ave appearances, and watching the
proper opportunity to ruin her cau&s;e, &s;oon after followed
her. But having a&s;&s;embled all his retainers, he openly
joined his force to that of the Londoners, and to Ste|phen's
<PB N="390" REF="424">
mercenary troops, who had not yet evacuated
the kingdom; and he be&s;ieged Matilda in Winche&s;ter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 10. Gul. Neubr. p. 363.</NOTE>.
That prince&s;s, being hard pre&s;&s;ed by famine, made her
e&s;cape; but in the flight, earl Robert, her brother, fell
into the hands of the enemy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 242. Hoveden, p. 488. Ge&s;t. Steph. p. 957. Chron. Norm. p. 979.</NOTE>. This nobleman, tho' a

as Stephen was of the other; and the Empre&s;s, &s;en&s;ible
of his merit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stephen re|lea&s;ed.</NOTE> con&s;ented to exchange the pri&s;oners on
equal terms<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Chron. Sax. p. 242. M. Paris, p. 54.</NOTE>. The civil war was again kindled with
greater fury than ever.</P>
<P>EARL Robert,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1142.</NOTE> finding the &s;ucce&s;&s;es on both &s;ides nearly
balanced, went over to Normandy, which, during Ste|phen's
captivity, had &s;ubmitted to the earl of Anjou;
and he per&s;uaded Geoffrey to allow his elde&s;t &s;on,
Henry, a young prince of great hopes, to take a journey
into England, and appear at the head of his partizans<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Chron. Norm. p. 979. M. Paris, p. 54.</NOTE>.
This expedient, however, produced nothing deci&s;ive.

by earl Robert at Wilton<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;t. Steph. p. 960. Trivet, p. 11. M. Paris, p. 54.</NOTE>: And the Empre&s;s, tho' of
a ma&s;culine &s;pirit, yet being hara&s;&s;ed with a variety of
good and bad fortune, and alarmed with continual dangers to her per&s;on and family, at la&s;t retired with her

This prince, finding, that the ca&s;tles built by the noblemen of his own party encouraged the &s;pirit of in|dependance,
and were little le&s;s dangerous than tho&s;e
<PB N="391" REF="425">

to extort from them a &s;urrender of the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es;

which his brother had brought over to his &s;ide, had, af|ter
&s;ome interval, joined the other party. Eugenius III.
had mounted the papal throne, and had deprived the
bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter of the legatine commi&s;&s;ion, which
he conferred on Theobald, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury,
the enemy and rival of the former legate. That pontiff,
having &s;ummoned a general council at Rheims in Cham|pagne,
in&s;tead of allowing the church of England, as
had been u&s;ual, to elect its own deputies, nominated five
Engli&s;h bi&s;hops to repre&s;ent that church, and required
their pre&s;ence in the council. Stephen, who, notwith|standing
his pre&s;ent difficulties, was jealous of the rights
of his crown, refu&s;ed them permi&s;&s;ion to attend<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 225.</NOTE>; and
the Pope, &s;en&s;ible of his advantage in contending with a
prince who reigned by a di&s;puted title, took revenge by
laying all Stephen's party under an interdict<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. W. Thorn. p. 1807.</NOTE>. By this
&s;entence, which was now fir&s;t known in England, di|vine
&s;ervice was prohibited, and all the functions of re|ligion
cea&s;ed, except the bapti&s;m of infants and the ab|&s;olution
of dying per&s;ons. The di&s;contents of the royal|i&s;ts
at this &s;ituation were augmented by a compari&s;on
with Matilda's party, who enjoyed all the benefits of the
&s;acred ordinances; and Stephen was at la&s;t obliged, by
making proper &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the &s;ee of Rome, to re|move
this reproach from his party<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 226.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE weakne&s;s of both &s;ides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1148.</NOTE> rather than any decrea&s;e

arms in England, many of the nobility, Roger de Mow|bray,
William de Warrenne, and others, finding no op|portunity
to exert their military ordor at home, inli&s;ted
them&s;elves in a new $ru&s;ade, which, with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;uc|ce&s;s,
after all former di&s;appointments and misfortunes,
was now preached by St. Barnard<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hagul&s;t. p. 275, 276.</NOTE>. But an event &s;oon
after happened, which threatened a revival of ho&s;tilities
in England. Prince Henry, who had reached his &s;ix|teenth
year, was de&s;irous of receiving the honour of
knighthood; a ceremony which every gentleman in that
age pa&s;&s;ed thro' before he was admitted to the u&s;e of
arms, and which was even deemed requi&s;ite for the
greate&s;t princes. He propo&s;ed to receive his admi&s;&s;ion
from his great-uncle, David King of Scotland; and for
that purpo&s;e, he pa&s;&s;ed thro' England with a great re|tinue,
and was attended by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his
partizans<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 490. Gul. Neubr. p. 378. Gerva&s;e, p. 1366.</NOTE>. He &s;taid &s;ome time with the King of Scot|land;
made &s;ome incur&s;ions into England; and by his
dexterity and vigour in all manly exercifes, by his va|lour
in war, and his prudent conduct in every occur|rence,
he rouzed the hopes of his party, and gave &s;ymp|toms
of tho&s;e great qualities, which he afterwards di&s;|played
when he mounted the throne of England. Soon
after his return to Normandy, he was, by Matilda's
con&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1150.</NOTE> inve&s;ted in that dutchy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. We&s;t, p. 245.</NOTE>; and upon the death
of his father, Geoffrey, which happened in the &s;ub&s;e|quent
year, he took, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion both of Anjou and Maine,
and concluded a marriage, which brought him a great
acce&s;&s;ion of power, and rendered him extremely formi|dable
to his rival. Eleanor, the daughter and heire&s;s of
William, duke of Guienne, and earl of Poictou, had
been married &s;ixteen years to Lewis VII. King of
and had attended him in a cru&s;ade, which that

monarch commanded again&s;t the infidels: But having
there lo&s;t the affections of her hu&s;band, and even fallen
under &s;ome &s;u&s;picions of gallantry with a hand&s;ome Sa|racen,
Lewis, more delicate than politic, procured a di|vorce
from her, and re&s;tored her tho&s;e rich provinces,
which by her marriage &s;he had annexed to the crown of
France<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Trivet, p. 21.</NOTE>. Young Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1152.</NOTE> neither di&s;couraged by the
inequality of years, nor by the reports of Eleanor's gal|lantry,
made &s;ucce&s;sful court&s;hip to that prince&s;s, and,

ri&s;ing fortune, had &s;uch an effect in England, that when Stephen, de&s;irous to en&s;ure the crown to his &s;on Eu&s;|tace,
required the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to anoint
that prince as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the primate refu&s;ed com|pliance,

totally unknown in antient ages; and the theory of fo|reign
politics, in each kingdom, formed a &s;peculation
much le&s;s complicate and involved than at pre&s;ent. Com|merce
had not yet bound the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations toge|ther
in &s;o clo&s;e a chain: Wars, fini&s;hed in one campaign
and often in one battle, were little affected by the move|ments
of remote &s;tates: The imperfect communication
among the kingdoms, and their ignorance of each other's
&s;ituation, made it impracticable for a great number of
them to combine in any one project or effort: And above
all, the turbulent &s;pirit and independant &s;ituation of the
barons or great va&s;&s;als in each &s;tate gave &s;o much occupa|tion

to the &s;overeign, that he was obliged to confine his
attention chiefly to his own &s;y&s;tem of government, and
was more indifferent about what pa&s;&s;ed among his neigh|bours.
Religion only, not politics, carried abroad the
views of princes; and either fixed their thoughts on the
Holy Land, who&s;e conque&s;t and defence was deemed a
point of common honour and intere&s;t, or engaged them
in intrigues with the court of Rome, to whom they had
yielded the direction of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and who
was every day a&s;&s;uming more authority than they were
willing to allow her.</P>
<P>BEFORE the conque&s;t of England by the duke of
Normandy, this i&s;land was as much &s;eparated from the
re&s;t of the world in politics as in &s;ituation; and except
from the inroads of the Dani&s;h pirates, the Engli&s;h, hap|pily
confined at home, had neither enemies nor allies on
the continent. The foreign dominions of William
connected them with the Kings and great va&s;&s;als of
France; and while the oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions of the Pope
and Emperor in Italy produced a continual intercour&s;e
between Germany and that country, the two great mo|narchs
of France and England formed, in another part
of Europe, a &s;eparate &s;y&s;tem, and carried on their wars
and negotiations, without meeting either with oppo&s;ition
or &s;upport from the others.</P>
<P>ON the decline of the Carlovingian race,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> the nobles,
in every province of France, taking advantage of the &s;o|vereign's
weakne&s;s, and obliged to provide, each for his
own defence, again&s;t the ravages of the Norman, free|booters,
had a&s;&s;umed, both in civil and military affairs,
an authority almo&s;t independant, and had reduced, within
very narrow limits, the prerogative of their princes. The
acce&s;&s;ion of Hugh Capet, by annexing a great fief to the
crown, had brought &s;ome addition of power to the royal
dignity; but this fief, tho' con&s;iderable for a &s;ubject,
<PB N="397" REF="433">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="398" REF="434">
appeared a narrow ba&s;is of force in a prince who was
placed at the head of &s;o great a community. The royal
deme&s;nes con&s;i&s;ted only of Paris, Orleans, E&s;tampes,
Compiegne, and a few places, &s;cattered over the nor|thern
provinces: In all the re&s;t of the kingdom, the
prince's authority was more nominal than real: The
va&s;&s;als were accu&s;tomed, nay intitled, to make war, with|out
his permi&s;&s;ion, on each other: They were even en|titled,
if they conceived them&s;elves to be injured, to turn
their arms again&s;t their &s;overeign: They exerci&s;ed all
civil juri&s;diction, without appeal, over their tenants and
inferior va&s;&s;als: Their common jealou&s;y of the crown
ea&s;ily united them again&s;t any attempt on their exorbitant
privileges; and as &s;ome of them had attained the power
and authority of great princes, even the &s;malle&s;t baron
was &s;ure of immediate and effectual protection. Be&s;ides
&s;ix eccle&s;ia&s;tical peerages, which, with the other immu|nities
of the church, cramped extremely the general exe|cution
of ju&s;tice; there were &s;ix lay-peerages, Burgundy,
Normandy, Guienne, Flanders, Tholou&s;e, and Cham|pagne,
which, formed very exten&s;ive and pui&s;&s;ant &s;o|vereignties.
And tho' the combination of all the&s;e prin|ces
and barons could, on occa&s;ion, mu&s;ter a mighty
power: Yet was it very difficult to &s;et that great machine
in movement; it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve har|mony
in its parts; a &s;en&s;e of common intere&s;t alone
could, for a time, unite them under their &s;overeign
again&s;t a common enemy; but if the King attempted to
turn the force of the community again&s;t any mutinous
va&s;&s;al, the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of common intere&s;t made the others
oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the &s;ucce&s;s of his preten&s;ions. Lewis
the Gro&s;s, the la&s;t &s;overeign, marched, at one time, to
his frontiers again&s;t the Germans at the head of an army
of two hundred thou&s;and men; but a petty lord of Cor|beil,
of Pui&s;et, of Couci, was able, at another time, to
<PB N="399" REF="435">
&s;et that prince at defiance, and to maintain open war
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE authority of the Engli&s;h monarch was much
more exten&s;ive within his kingdom, and the di&s;proportion
much greater between him and the mo&s;t powerful of his
va&s;&s;als. His deme&s;nes and revenue were very large, com|pared
to the greatne&s;s of his &s;tate: He was accu&s;tomed
to levy arbitrary exactions from his &s;ubjects: His courts
of judicature exerci&s;ed juri&s;diction in every part of the
kingdom: He could cru&s;h by his power, or by a judicial
&s;entence, well or ill founded, any obnoxious baron:
And tho' the feudal in&s;titutions, which prevailed in his
kingdom, had the &s;ame tendency, as in other &s;tates, to
exalt the ari&s;tocracy, and depre&s;s the monarchy, it requi|red,
in England, according to its pre&s;ent con&s;titution, a
great combination of the va&s;&s;als to oppo&s;e their &s;overeign
lord, and there had not hitherto ari&s;en any baron &s;o
powerful, as of him&s;elf to make war again&s;t the prince,
and afford protection to the inferior barons.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;uch were the different &s;ituations of France
and England, and the latter enjoyed &s;o great advanta|ges
over the former; the acce&s;&s;ion of Henry II. a prince
of great abilities, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many rich provinces on
the continent, might appear an event dangerous, if not
fatal, to the French monarchy, and &s;ufficient to break
entirely the balance between the &s;tates. He was ma&s;ter,
in the right of his father, of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine;
in that of his mother, of Normandy; in that of his
wife, Guienne, Poictou, Xaintonge, Auvergne, Peri|gord,
Angoumois, the Limou&s;in. He &s;oon after annexed
Brittany to his other &s;tates, and was already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of the &s;uperiority over that province, which, on the fir&s;t
ce&s;&s;ion of Normandy to Rollo the Dane, had, by Charles
the Simple, been granted in va&s;&s;alage to that formidable
ravager. The&s;e provinces compo&s;ed above a third of the
<PB N="400" REF="436">
whole French monarchy, and were much &s;uperior, in
extent and opulence, to tho&s;e territories, which were
&s;ubjected to the immediate juri&s;diction and government
of the King. The va&s;&s;al was here more powerful than
his liege lord: The &s;ituation, which had enabled Hugh
Capet to depo&s;e the Carlovingian princes, &s;eemed here to
be renewed, and that with much greater advantages on
the &s;ide of the va&s;&s;al: And when England was added to
&s;o many provinces, the French King had rea&s;on to appre|hend,
from this conjuncture, &s;ome great di&s;a&s;ter to him|&s;elf
and to his family. But in reality, it was this cir|cum&s;tance,
which appeared &s;o formidable, that &s;aved the
Capetian race, and, by its con&s;equences, exalted them to
that pitch of grandeur, which they at pre&s;ent enjoy.</P>
<P>THE limited authority of the prince in the feudal
con&s;titutions prevented the King of England from em|ploying
with advantage the force of &s;o many &s;tates,
which were &s;ubjected to his government; and the&s;e dif|ferent
members, disjoined in &s;ituation, and di&s;agreeing in
laws, language and manners, were never thoroughly ce|mented
into one monarchy. He &s;oon became, both from
his di&s;tant place of re&s;idence and from the incompatability
of intere&s;ts, a kind of foreigner to his French dominions;
and his &s;ubjects on the continent con&s;idered their allegi|ance
as more naturally due to their &s;uperior lord, who
lived in their neighbourhood, and who was acknowledged
$word$ be the &s;upreme head of their nation. He was always
$word$ to invade them; their immediate lord was often
at $ great a di&s;tance to protect them; and any di&s;order
in any part of his di&s;per&s;ed dominions gave advantages
again&s;t him. The other powerful va&s;&s;als of the French
crown were rather plea&s;ed to &s;ee the expul&s;ion of the
Engli&s;h, and were not affected with that jealou&s;y, which
would have ari&s;en from the oppre&s;&s;ion of a co-va&s;&s;al, who
was of the &s;ame rank with them&s;elves. By this means,
<PB N="401" REF="437">
the King of France found it more ea&s;y to conquer the&s;e
numerous provinces from England, than to &s;ubdue a duke
of Normandy or Guienne, a count of Anjou, Maine or
Poictou. And after reducing &s;uch exten&s;ive territories,
which immediately incorporated with the body of the
monarchy, he found greater facility of uniting to the
crown the other great fiefs, which &s;till remained &s;eparate
and independant.</P>
<P>BUT as the&s;e important con&s;equences could not be
fore&s;een by human wi&s;dom, the French King remarked
with terror the ri&s;ing grandeur of the hou&s;e of Anjou or
Plantagenet; and in order to retard its progre&s;s, he had
ever maintained a &s;trict union with Stephen, and had en|deavoured
to &s;upport the tottering fortunes of that bold
u&s;urper. But after this prince's death, it was too late
to think of oppo&s;ing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Henry, or pre|venting
the performance of tho&s;e &s;tipulations, which,
with the unanimous con&s;ent of the nation, he had made
with his predece&s;&s;or. The Engli&s;h, tired with civil wars,
and di&s;gu&s;ted with the blood&s;hed and depredations, which,
during the cour&s;e of &s;o many years, had attended them,
were little di&s;po&s;ed to violate their oaths, by excluding
the lawful heir from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their monarchy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. Paris$ p. 65.</NOTE>.
Many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable fortre&s;&s;es were in the
hands of his partizans; the whole nation had had occa|&s;ion
to &s;ee the noble qualities with which he was en|dowed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neubr. p. 381.</NOTE>,
and to compare them with the mean talents of
William, the &s;on of Stephen; and as they were ac|quainted
with his great power, and were rather plea&s;ed to
&s;ee the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;o many foreign dominions to the
crown of England, they never entertained the lea&s;t
thoughts of re&s;i&s;ting him. Henry him&s;elf, &s;en&s;ible of
the advantages attending his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, was in
no hurry to arrive in England; and being engaged in
<PB N="402" REF="438">
the &s;iege of a ca&s;tle on the frontiers of Normandy, when
he received intelligence of Stephen's death, he made a
point of honour in not departing from his enterprize,
till he had brought it to an i&s;&s;ue. He then &s;et out on
his journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th Decem.</NOTE> and was received in England with the ac|clamations of all orders of men, who &s;wore with plea|&s;ure
the oath of fealty and allegiance to him.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t act of Henry's government corre&s;ponded to
the high ideas entertained of his vigour and abilities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1155.</NOTE> and
progno&s;ticated the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of ju&s;tice and tran|quillity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t acts of Henry's government.</NOTE>
of which the kingdom had been &s;o long bereav|ed.
He immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e mercenary &s;ol|diers,
who had committed infinite di&s;orders in the na|tion;
and he &s;ent them abroad, together with William
d'Ypres, their leader, the great friend and confident of
Stephen<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 13. M. Paris, p. 65. Neubr. p. 381. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 30.</NOTE>. He revoked all the grants made by his pre|dece&s;&s;or<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 382.</NOTE>,
and even tho&s;e which nece&s;&s;ity had extorted

been extremely deba&s;ed during his predece&s;&s;or's reign;
and he took proper mea&s;ures again&s;t the return of like abu&s;es<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 491.</NOTE>. He was rigorous in the execution of ju&s;tice,
and in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of robbery and violence; and
that he might re&s;tore authority to the laws, he cau&s;ed
all the new erected ca&s;tles to be demoli&s;hed, which had
proved &s;o many &s;anctuaries to freebooters and rebels<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 491. Fitz-Steph. p. 13. M. Paris, p. 65. Neubr p. 381. Brompton, p. 1043.</NOTE>.

But be&s;ides, that this &s;tory is not very likely of it&s;elf, and &s;avours of monki&s;h fiction, it is found in no other antient writer, and is contradicted by &s;ome of them, par|ticularly the monk of Marimoutier, who had better opportunities than Newbridge of knowing the truth. See Vita Gaufr. Duc. Norman. p. 103$.</NOTE>. On the King's
appearance, the people returned to their allegiance; and
Geoffrey, re&s;igning his claim, for an annual pen&s;ion of
a thou&s;and pounds, departed and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
county of Nantz, which the inhabitants, who had ex|pelled
count Hoel, their prince, had put into his hands<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1049.</NOTE>.
Henry returned to England in the following year; and
the incur&s;ions of the Wel&s;h then provoked him to make
an inva&s;ion upon them; where the natural fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of
the country bred him great difficulties, and even brought
him into danger. His vanguard, being engaged in a narrow
pa&s;s, was put to rout; and Henry de E&s;&s;ex, the heredi|tary
&s;tandard-bearer, &s;eized with a panic, threw down
the &s;tandard, took to flight, and exclaimed that the
King was &s;lain: And had not that prince immediately

even the mo&s;t frivolous; and their feeble authority made
it commonly impracticable for them to delegate, on oc|ca&s;ion,
the command to their generals. Geoffrey, the
King's brother, died &s;oon after he had acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Nantz; and tho' he had no other title to that coun|ty,
than the voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or election of the in|habitants
two years before, Henry laid claim to the ter|ritory
as devolved to him by hereditary right, and he
went over to &s;upport his preten&s;ions by force of arms.
Conan, duke or earl of Britanny (for the&s;e titles are gi|ven
indifferently by hi&s;torians to the&s;e princes) pretended
that Nantz had been lately &s;eparated by rebellion from
his principality, to which of right it belonged; and im|mediately
on Geoffrey's death, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
di&s;puted territory. Le&s;t Lewis, the French King, &s;hould
interpo&s;e in the controver&s;y, Henry paid him a vi&s;it;
and &s;o allured him by care&s;&s;es and civilities, that an al|liance
was contracted between the monarchs, and they
agreed, that young Henry, heir of the Engli&s;h monar|chy,
&s;hould be affianced to Margaret of France<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 68. M. We&s;t. p. 248. Trivet, p. 35.</NOTE>, tho'
the former was only five years of age, and the latter
was &s;till in her cradle. Henry, now &s;ecure of meeting
with no interruption on this &s;ide, advanced with his army
<PB N="405" REF="441">
into Britanny; and Conan, in de&s;pair of being able
to make re&s;i&s;tance, delivered up the county of Nantz to
the King: The ability of that monarch procured him
farther and more important advantages from this incident.
Conan, hara&s;&s;ed with the turbulent di&s;po&s;ition of his
&s;ubjects, was de&s;irous of procuring to him&s;elf the &s;up|port
of &s;o great a monarch; and he betrothed his daugh|ter
and only child, yet an infant, to Geoffrey, the King's
third &s;on, who was of the &s;ame tender years. The
duke of Britanny died about &s;even years after; and
Henry, on pretence of being guardian to his &s;on and
daughter-in-law, put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that prin|cipality,
and annexed it to his other great dominions<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 517. Newbr. p. 396. Chron. W. Heming. p. 496.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King had a pro&s;pect of making &s;till farther ac|qui&s;itions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1159.</NOTE>
and the activity of his temper allowed no
opportunity of that kind to e&s;cape him. Philippa, dutch|e&s;s
of Guienne, mother of Queen Eleanor, was the
only i&s;&s;ue of William IV. count of Thoulou&s;e; and
&s;hould have inherited his dominions, had not that prince,
de&s;irous of pre&s;erving the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the male-line,
conveyed the principality to his brother, Raymond de
St. Gilles, by a contract of &s;ale which was in that age
regarded as fictitious and illu&s;ory. By this means, the
title to the county of Thoulou&s;e came to be di&s;puted be|tween

Alfon&s;o, the &s;on of Raymond, was the reigning
&s;overeign; and on Henry's reviving his wife's claim,
this prince had recour&s;e for protection to the King of
France, who was &s;o much concerned in policy to prevent
the farther aggrandizement of the Engli&s;h monarch.
Lewis him&s;elf, when married to Eleanor, had a&s;&s;erted
<PB N="406" REF="442">
the ju&s;tice of her claim, and had demanded po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Thoulou&s;e<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Newbr. p. 387. Chron. W. Heming. p. 494.</NOTE>; but his &s;entiments changing with his
intere&s;t, he now determined to defend, by his power and
authority, the title of Alfon&s;o. Henry found, that it
would be requi&s;ite to &s;upport his preten&s;ions again&s;t po|tent
antagoni&s;ts; and that nothing but a great army
could maintain a claim, which he had in vain a&s;&s;erted by
arguments and manife&s;tos.</P>
<P>AN army, compo&s;ed of feudal va&s;&s;als, was commonly
very intractable and undi&s;ciplined, both becau&s;e of the
independant &s;pirit of the per&s;ons who &s;erved in it, and
becau&s;e the commands were not given either by the choice
of the &s;overeign or from the military capacity and expe|rience
of the officers. Each baron conducted his own
va&s;&s;als: His rank was greater or le&s;s, proportioned to
the extent of his property: Even the &s;upreme command
under the prince was often attached to birth: And as the
military va&s;&s;als were obliged to &s;erve only forty days at
their own charge; tho', if the expedition was di&s;tant,
they were put to great expence; the prince reaped very
little benefit from their attendance. Henry, &s;en&s;ible of
the&s;e inconveniencies, levied upon his va&s;&s;als in Nor|mandy
and other provinces, which were remote from
Thoulou&s;e, a &s;um of money in lieu of their &s;ervice; and
this commutation, by rea&s;on of the great di&s;tance, was
&s;till more advantageous for his Engli&s;h va&s;&s;als, He im|po&s;ed,
therefore, a &s;$utage of three pounds on each
knight's fee, a condition, to which, tho' it was unu&s;ual,
and the fir&s;t perhaps to be met with in hi&s;tory<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, vol. i. p. 1216. Gerva&s;e, p. 1381.</NOTE>, the mi|litary
tenants willingly &s;ubmitted; and with this money,
he levied an army which was more under his command,
and who&s;e &s;ervice was more durable and con&s;tant.
A&s;&s;i&s;ted by Berenger, count of Barcelona, and Trincaval,
<PB N="407" REF="443">
count of Ni&s;mes, whom he had gained over to his party,
he invaded the county of Thoulou&s;e; and after taking
Verdun, Cha&s;telnau, and other places, he be&s;ieged the
capital of the province, and was likely to prevail in the
enterprize; when Lewis, advancing before the arrival
of his main body, threw him&s;elf into the place with a
&s;mall reinforcement. Henry was urged by &s;ome of his
mini&s;ters to pro&s;ecute the &s;iege, to take Lewis pri&s;oner,
and to impo&s;e his own terms in the pacification; but he
either thought it &s;o much his intere&s;t to maintain the
feudal principles, by which his foreign dominions were
&s;ecured, or bore &s;o much re&s;pect to his &s;uperior lord,
that he declared he would not attack a place defended by
him in per&s;on; and he immediately rai&s;ed the &s;iege<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 22. Diceto, p. 531.</NOTE>.
He marched into Normandy to protect that province
again&s;t an incur&s;ion, which the count of Dreux, in&s;ti|gated
by King Lewis, his brother, had made upon it.
War was now openly carried on between the two mo|narchs,
but produced no memorable event, and was
&s;topped by a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, and afterwards by a peace,
which was not, however, attended with any confidence
or good corre&s;pondence between the&s;e rival princes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1160.</NOTE> The
fortre&s;s of Gi&s;ors, being part of the dowry &s;tipulated to

delivered into Henry's hands, after the celebration of
the nuptials. The King, that he might have a pretence
for immediately demanding the place, ordered the mar|riage
to be &s;olemnized between the prince and prince&s;s,
tho' both infants<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 492. Newbr. 400. Diceto, p. 532. Brompton, p. 1450.</NOTE>; and he engaged the grand-ma&s;ter of
the Temple, by large pre&s;ents, as was generally &s;u&s;pected,
to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gi&s;ors. Lewis re&s;enting this

and would have made war upon the King of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1161.</NOTE>
had it not been for the mediation and authority of Pope
Alexander III. who had been chaced from Rome by
the $ntipope, Victor IV. and re&s;ided at that time in
France. That we may form a notion of the authority
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Roman Pontiff during tho&s;e ages, it may
be proper to remark, that the two Kings had, the year
before, met the Pope at the ca&s;tle of Torci on the Loir;
and they gave him &s;uch marks of re&s;pect, that both di&s;|mounted
from their hor&s;es to receive him, and holding
each of them one of the reins of his bridle, walked on
foot by his &s;ide, and conducted him in that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive

the King or the prie&s;ts, particularly the archbi&s;hop of

a&s;piring &s;pirit of Henry, which gave inquietude to all his
neighbours, was not likely to pay long a tame &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to the encroachments of &s;ubjects; and as nothing
opens men's eyes &s;o readily as their intere&s;t, he was in

which retained his people in &s;ubjection.
From the commencement of his reign, in the govern|ment
of his foreign dominions, as well as of England,
he had &s;howed a fixed purpo&s;e to repre&s;s clerical u&s;ur|pations,
and to maintain tho&s;e prerogatives, which had
been tran&s;mitted to him by his predece&s;&s;ors. During
the &s;chi&s;m of the papacy between Alexander and Victor,
he had determined, for &s;ome time, to remain neuter;
and when he was informed, that the archbi&s;hop of Ro&uuml;en
and the bi&s;hop of Mans had, from their own authority,
acknowledged Alexander as legitimate Pope, he was &s;o
enraged, that, tho' he &s;pared the archbi&s;hop on account
of his age, he immediately i&s;&s;ued orders for overthrow|ing
the hou&s;es of the bi&s;hop of Mans and archdeacon of
Ro&uuml;en<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Stephen, p. 18. This conduct appears violent and arbitra|ry; but was &s;uitable to the &s;train of admini&s;tration in tho&s;e days. His father, Geoffrey, tho' repre&s;ented as a mild prince, &s;et him an example of much greater violence. When Geoffrey was ma&s;ter of Normandy, the chapter of Seez pre&s;umed, without his con&s;ent, to proceed to the election of a bi&s;hop; upon which he ordered all of them with the bi|&s;hop-elect to be ca&s;trated, and made all their te&s;ticles be brought him in a platter.

exerci&s;e authority over any of his dominions. In Eng|land,
the mild character and advanced years of Theo|bald,
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, together with his merits
in refu&s;ing to put the crown on the head of Eu&s;tace, &s;on
of Stephen, prevented Henry, during the lifetime of that
primate, from taking any mea&s;ures again&s;t the multi|plied

and being endowed both with indu&s;try and capa|city,

to travel for farther improvement to Italy, where
he &s;tudied the civil and canon law at Bologna<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 12. Brompton, p. 1057.</NOTE>; and on
his return, he appeared to have made &s;uch proficiency in

archdeaconry of Canterbury, an office of con&s;iderable
tru&s;t and profit<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quadr. p. 6. M. Paris, p. 69.</NOTE>. He was afterwards employed with
&s;ucce&s;s by Theobald in tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s at Rome;
and on Henry's acce&s;&s;ion, he was recommended to that
monarch as worthy of farther preferment<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1057. Gerva&s;e, p. 1377.</NOTE>. Henry,
who knew that Becket had been in&s;trumental in &s;upport|ing
that re&s;olution of the archbi&s;hop, which had tended
&s;o much to facilitate his own advancement to the throne,
was already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his favour; and finding, on
farther acquaintance, that his &s;pirit and abilities entitled
him to any tru&s;t, he &s;oon promoted him to the dig|nity
of chancellor, one of the fir&s;t civil offices in the
kingdom. The chancellor, in that age, be&s;ides the
cu&s;tody of the great &s;eal, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all vacant
prelacies and abbies; he was the guardian of all &s;uch
minors and pupils as were the King's tenants; all baro|nies
which e&s;cheated to the crown were under his

admini&s;tration; he was entitled to a place in council,
even tho' he was not particularly &s;ummoned; and as he
exerci&s;ed al&s;o the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and it be|longed
to him to counter&s;ign all commi&s;&s;ions, writs,

was concerned in the di&s;patch of every bu&s;ine&s;s of im|portance<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 13.</NOTE>.
After obtaining this high office, Becket, as
he advanced in favour, was made provo&s;t of Beverley,
dean of Ha&s;tings, and con&s;table of the Tower: He was
put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the honours of Eye and Berkham,
large baronies that had e&s;cheated to the crown; and to
compleat his grandeur, he was entru&s;ted with the educa|tion

of the monarchy<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 15. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 9, 14.</NOTE>. The pomp of his retinue, the &s;ump|tuou&s;ne&s;s

the munificence of his pre&s;ents, corre&s;ponded to the&s;e great
preferments; or rather exceeded any thing, which
England had ever before &s;een in any &s;ubject. His hi&s;to|rian
and &s;ecretary, Fitz-Stephens<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">P. 15.</NOTE>, mentions, among
other particulars, that his apartments were every day in
winter covered with clean &s;traw or hay, and in &s;um|mer

who paid their court to him, and who could not, by

vouch&s;afed to partake of his entertainments. As his
way of life was &s;plendid and opulent, his amu&s;ements
and occupations were gay, and partook of the cavalier

did not think unbefitting his character. He employed

familiarity is mentioned by Fitz-Stephens, which, as it
&s;hows the manners of the age, it may not be improper
to relate. One day, as the King and chancellor were
riding together in the &s;treets of London, they ob&s;erved
a beggar, who was &s;hivering with cold. Would it not
be very prai&s;e-worthy, &s;aid the King, to give that poor
man a warm coat in this &s;evere &s;ea&s;on? It would, &s;urely,
replied the chancellor; and you do well, Sir, in think|ing
of &s;uch good actions. Then he &s;hall have one pre|&s;ently,
cried the King: And &s;eizing the &s;kirt of the
chancellor's coat, began to pull it violently. The chan|cellor
defended him&s;elf for &s;ome time; and they had
<PB N="413" REF="451">
both of them like to have tumbled off their hor&s;es in
the &s;treet, when Becket, after a vehement &s;truggle, let
go his coat; which the King be&s;towed on the beggar,
who, being ignorant of the quality of the per&s;ons, was
not a little &s;urpri&s;ed with the pre&s;ent<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BECKET, who, by his complai&s;ance and good hu|mour,

to inform him whom he &s;hould ab&s;olve and whom ex|communicate<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 28.</NOTE>: And it was not till after many remon|&s;trances
and menaces, that Becket, tho' with the wor&s;t
grace imaginable, was induced to comply with the royal
mandate.</P>
<P>HENRY, tho' he found him&s;elf thus grievou&s;ly mi&s;|taken
in the character of the per&s;on whom he had pro|moted
to the primacy, determined not to de&s;i&s;t from his
former intention of retrenching clerical u&s;urpations. He
was entirely ma&s;ter of his exten&s;ive dominions: The
prudence and vigour of his government, attended with
perpetual &s;ucce&s;s, had rai&s;ed his character above that of
any of his predece&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 130.</NOTE>: The papacy was weakened by
a &s;chi&s;m, which divided all Europe: And he rightly
judged, that, if the pre&s;ent favourable opportunity were
neglected, the crown mu&s;t, from the prevalent &s;uper|&s;tition
of the people, be in danger of falling into an en|tire
&s;ubordination under the mitre.</P>
<P>THE union of the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers &s;erves
extremely, in every civilized government, to the main|tenance
of peace and order; and prevents tho&s;e mutual
incroachments, which, as there can be no ultimate judge
between them, are often attended with the mo&s;t dan|gerous
con&s;equences. Whether the &s;upreme magi&s;trate,
who unites the&s;e powers, receives the appellation of prince
or prelate, it is not material: The &s;uperior weight,
which temporal intere&s;ts commonly bear in the appre|hen&s;ions
<PB N="417" REF="455">
of men above &s;piritual, renders the civil part
of his character mo&s;t prevalent; and in time prevents
tho&s;e gro&s;s impo&s;tures and bigotted per&s;ecutions, which,
in all fal&s;e religions, are the chief foundation of cleri|cal
authority. But during the progre&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical
u&s;urpations, the &s;tate, by the re&s;i&s;tance of the civil ma|gi&s;trate,
is naturally thrown into convul&s;ions; and it be|hoves
the prince, both for his own intere&s;t, and for that
of the public, to provide in time &s;ufficient barriers again&s;t
&s;o dangerous and in&s;idious a rival. This precaution had
been hitherto much neglected in England, as well as in
other catholic countries; and affairs at la&s;t &s;eemed to
have come to a dangerous cri&s;is: A &s;overeign of the
greate&s;t abilities was now on the throne: A prelate of
the mo&s;t inflexible and intrepid character was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of the primacy: The contending powers appeared to be
armed with their full force, and it was natural to ex|pect
&s;ome extraordinary event to re&s;ult from their ren|counter.</P>
<P>AMONG their other inventions to obtain money, the
clergy had inculcated the nece&s;&s;ity of penance as an
atonement for &s;in; and having again introduced the prac|tice
of paying them large &s;ums as a commutation, or
&s;pecies of atonement, for the remi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e penan|ces,
the &s;ins of the people, by the&s;e means, had become
a revenue to the prie&s;ts; and the King computed, that,
by this invention alone, they levied more money from
his &s;ubjects, than flowed, by all the funds and taxes,
into the royal exchequer<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 32.</NOTE>. That he might $ea&s;e his
&s;ubjects of &s;o heavy and arbitrary an impo&s;ition, Henry
required, that a civil officer of his appointment &s;hould
be pre&s;ent in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and &s;hould, for
the future, give his con&s;ent to every compo&s;ition which
was made with &s;inners for their &s;piritual offences.</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="456">
THE eccle&s;ia&s;tics, in that age, had renounced all im|mediate
&s;ubordination to the magi&s;trate: They openly
pretended to an exemption, in criminal accu&s;ations,
from a trial before courts of ju&s;tice; and were gradually
introducing a like exemption in civil cau&s;es: Spiritual
penalties alone could be inflicted on their offences: And
as the clergy had extremely multiplied in England, and
many of them were con&s;equently of very low charac|ters,
crimes of the deepe&s;t dye, murders, robberies,
adulteries, rapes, were daily committed with impunity
by the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. It had been found, for in&s;tance,
by enquiry, that no le&s;s than an hundred murders had,
&s;ince the King's acce&s;&s;ion, been perpetrated by men of
that profe&s;&s;ion, who had never been called to account
for the&s;e offences<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 394.</NOTE>; and holy orders were become a full
protection for all enormities. A clerk in Worce&s;ter&s;hire,
having debauched a gentleman's daughter, had, at this
time, proceeded to murder the father; and the general
indignation again&s;t this crime moved the King to attempt
the remedy of an abu&s;e which was become &s;o palpable,
and to require that the clerk &s;hould be delivered up,
and receive condign puni&s;hment from the magi&s;trate<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 33. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 32.</NOTE>.
Becket in&s;i&s;ted on the privileges of the church; confined
the criminal to the bi&s;hop's pri&s;on, le&s;t he &s;hould be
&s;eized by the King's officers; maintained that no greater
puni&s;hment could be inflicted on him than degradation:
And when the King demanded, that, immediately after
he was degraded, he &s;hould be tried by the civil power,
the primate a&s;&s;erted, that it was iniquitous to try a
man twice upon the &s;ame accu&s;ation, and for the &s;ame
crime<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 29. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 33. 45. Hoveden, p. 492. M. Paris, p. 72. Diceto, p. 536, 537. Brompton, p. 1058. Ger|va&s;e, p. 1384. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 208, 209.</NOTE>.</P>

HENRY, laying hold of &s;o favourable a cau&s;e, re&s;olv|ed
to pu&s;h the clergy with regard to all their privileges,
which they had rai&s;ed to an enormous height, and to
determine at once tho&s;e controver&s;ies, which daily mul|tiplied,
between the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;dictions.
He &s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly of all the prelates of England;
and he put to them this conci&s;e and deci&s;ive que&s;tion,
Whether or not they were willing to &s;ubmit to the an|tient

was &s;en&s;ible of the artifice, and was provoked to the
highe&s;t indignation. He left the a&s;&s;embly, with vi&s;ible
marks of his di&s;plea&s;ure: He required the primate in|&s;tantly

Berkham<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 35. Gerva&s;e, p. 1385.</NOTE>: The bi&s;hops were terrified, and expected
&s;till farther effects of his re&s;entment. Becket alone was
inflexible; and nothing but the interpo&s;ition of the Pope's
legate, Philip, abbot of Eleemo&s;ina, who dreaded a
breach with &s;o powerful a prince at &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a

<P>BUT Henry was not content with a declaration in
the&s;e general terms: He re&s;olved, ere it was too late,
to define expre&s;sly tho&s;e cu&s;toms, with which he required
compliance, and to put a &s;top to clerical u&s;urpations,
before they were fully con&s;olidated, and could plead an|tiquity,
as they already did a &s;acred authority, in their

favour. The claims of the church were open and vi&s;i|ble.
After a gradual and in&s;en&s;ible progre&s;s thro' many
centuries, the ma&s;k had at la&s;t been taken off, and &s;e|veral
eccle&s;ia&s;tical councils, by their canons, which were
pretended to be irrevocable and infallible, had po&s;itively
defined tho&s;e privileges and immunities, which gave &s;uch
general offence, and appeared &s;o dangerous, to the civil
magi&s;trate. Henry therefore deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to de|fine
with the &s;ame preci&s;ion the limits of the civil power;
to oppo&s;e his legal cu&s;toms to their divine ordinances;
to determine the exact boundaries of the rival juri&s;dic|tions;

<P>THESE articles, to the number of &s;ixteen, were cal|culated
to prevent the principal abu&s;es, which had pre|vailed
in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and to put an effectual
&s;top to the u&s;urpations of the church, which, gradually
&s;tealing on, had threatened the total de&s;truction of the
civil power. Henry, therefore, by reducing the&s;e cu&s;|toms
to writing and collecting them in a body, endea|voured
to prevent all future di&s;pute with regard to
them; and by pa&s;&s;ing &s;o many eccle&s;ia&s;tical ordinances

&s;uperiority of the legi&s;lature above all papal decrees or

But as he knew, that the bi&s;hops, tho'
overawed by the pre&s;ent combination of the crown and
the barons, would take the fir&s;t favourable opportunity
of denying the authority, which had enacted the&s;e con|stitutions;
he re&s;olved, that they &s;hould all &s;et their &s;eal

the prelates dared to oppo&s;e his will; except Becket,
who, tho' urged by the earls of Cornwal and Leice&s;ter,
the barons of principal authority in the kingdom, ob|&s;tinately
with-held his con&s;ent. At la&s;t, Richard de
Ha&s;tings, grand prior of the templars in England, threw
him&s;elf on his knees before him; and with many tears,
entreated him, if he paid any regard, either to his own
&s;afety or that of the church, not to provoke, by a fruit|le&s;s
oppo&s;ition, the indignation of a great monarch,
who was re&s;olutely bent on his purpo&s;e, and who was

thinking that he had now finally prevailed in this great
enterprize, &s;ent the con&s;titutions to Pope Alexander,
who then re&s;ided in France; and he required that Pon|tiff's
ratification of them: But Alexander, who plainly
&s;aw, that the&s;e laws were calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h the in|dependancy
of England on the papacy, and of the royal
power on the clergy, condemned them in the &s;tronge&s;t

his conce&s;&s;ions; and endeavoured to engage all the other
bi&s;hops in a confederacy to adhere to their common
rights, and to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, in which he
repre&s;ented the intere&s;t and honour of God to be &s;o deeply

<P>THE King had rai&s;ed Becket from a low &s;tation to the

when he found him become of a &s;udden his mo&s;t rigid op|ponent,
while every one be&s;ide complied with his will,
rage at the di&s;appointment, and indignation again&s;t &s;uch
&s;ignal ingratitude, tran&s;ported him beyond all bounds of
moderation; and there &s;eems to have entered more of
pa&s;&s;ion than of ju&s;tice or even of policy, in this violent
pro&s;ecution<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 394.</NOTE>. The barons, however, in the great coun|cil

bore a &s;ecret favour to Becket, and regarded him as the
martyr of their privileges, concurred with the re&s;t, in
the de&s;ign of oppre&s;&s;ing their primate. In vain did
Becket urge, that his court was proceeding with the
utmo&s;t regularity and ju&s;tice in trying the mare&s;chal's

&s;heriff's te&s;timony, to be entirely unju&s;t and iniquitous:
That he him&s;elf had di&s;covered no contempt of the King's
court; but on the contrary, by &s;ending four knights to
excu&s;e his ab&s;ence, had virtually acknowledged its
authority: That he al&s;o, in con&s;equence of the King's

council, ready to ju&s;tify his cau&s;e again&s;t the mare&s;chal,
and to &s;ubmit his conduct to their enquiry and juri&s;|diction:
And that even &s;hould he be found to have been
guilty of non-appearance, the laws had affixed a very
&s;light penalty to that offence; and that, as he was an
inhabitant of Kent, where his archiepi&s;copal palace was
&s;eated, he was by law entitled to &s;ome greater indul|gence
<PB N="426" REF="466">
than u&s;ual in the rate of his fine<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 37. 42.</NOTE>. He was con|demned,

&s;everal Norman barons voted in this council; and we
may conclude, with &s;ome probability, that a like practice
had prevailed in many of the great councils &s;ummoned
&s;ince the conque&s;t. For the contemporary hi&s;torian, who
has given us a full account of the&s;e tran&s;actions, does not
mention this circum&s;tance as any wi&s;e &s;ingular<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 36.</NOTE>; and
Becket, in all his &s;ub&s;equent remon&s;trances with regard
to the &s;evere treatment, which he had met with, never
founds any objection on an irregularity, which to us ap|pears
very palpable and flagrant. So little preci&s;ion was
there at that time in the government and con&s;titution!</P>
<P>THE King was not content with this &s;entence, how|ever
violent and oppre&s;&s;ive. Next day, he demanded of
Becket the &s;um of three hundred pounds, which the pri|mate
had levied from the honours of Eye and Berkham,
while in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Becket, after premi&s;ing that he
was not obliged to an&s;wer this &s;uit, becau&s;e it was not
contained in his &s;ummons; after remarking, that he had
expended more than that &s;um in the repairs of the&s;e
<PB N="427" REF="467">
ca&s;tles and of the royal palace at London; expre&s;&s;ed
however his re&s;olution not to allow money to be any
ground of quarrel between him and his &s;overeign: He
agreed to pay the &s;um; and immediately gave &s;ureties for
it<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 38.</NOTE>. In the &s;ub&s;equent meeting, the King demanded
five hundred marks, which, he affirmed, he had lent
Becket during the war at Thoulou&s;e<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 47.</NOTE>; and another &s;um
to the &s;ame amount, for which that prince had been &s;urety
for him to a Jew. Immediately after the&s;e two claims,
he &s;tarted a third of &s;till greater importance: He required
him to give in the account of his admini&s;tration while
chancellor, and to pay the balance due from the revenues
of all the prelacies, abbies, and baronies, which had,
during that time, been &s;ubjected to his management<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 494. Diceto, p. 537.</NOTE>.
Becket ob&s;erved, that as this demand was totally unex|pected,
he had not come prepared to an&s;wer it; but he
required a delay, and promi&s;ed in that ca&s;e to give &s;ati&s;|faction.
The King in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;ureties; and Becket
de&s;ired leave to con&s;ult with his &s;uffragans in a ca&s;e of
&s;uch importance<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is apparent, from the known character of Henry,
and from the u&s;ual vigilance of his government, that
when he promoted Becket to the &s;ee of Canterbury, he
was, on good grounds, well plea&s;ed with his admini&s;tra|tion
in the former high office, with which he had en|tru&s;ted
him; and that, even if that prelate had di&s;&s;ipated
money beyond the income of his place, the King was
&s;atisfied that his expences were not blameable, and had
in the main been calculated for his &s;ervice<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 495.</NOTE>. Two years
had &s;ince elap&s;ed; no demands had during that time been
made upon him; it was not till the quarrel aro&s;e con|cerning
eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, that the claim was &s;tarted,
<PB N="428" REF="468">
and the primate was, of a &s;udden, required to produce
accounts of &s;uch intricacy and extent before a tribunal,
which had &s;hown a determined re&s;olution to ruin and
oppre&s;s him. To find &s;ureties, that he &s;hould an&s;wer &s;o
boundle&s;s and uncertain a claim, which, in the King's e&s;timation, amounted to 44,000 marks<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 315.</NOTE>, was impracti|cable;
and Becket's &s;uffragans were extremely at a lo&s;s
what council to give him, in &s;uch a critical emergency.
By the $dvice of the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter he offered two
thou&s;and marks as a general &s;atisfaction for all demands: But this offer was rejected by the King<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. P. 38.</NOTE>. Some prelates
coun&s;elled him to re&s;ign his &s;ee, on condition of recei|ving
an acquittal: Others were of opinion, that he ought
to &s;ubmit him&s;elf entirely to the King's mercy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 39. Gerva&s;e, p. 1390.</NOTE>: But
the primate, thus pu&s;hed to the utmo&s;t, had too much
courage to &s;ink under oppre&s;&s;ion: He determined to brave
all his enemies, to tru&s;t to the &s;acredne&s;s of his character
for protection, to involve his cau&s;e with that of God
and religion, and to &s;tand the utmo&s;t efforts of royal in|dignation.</P>
<P>AFTER a few days, &s;pent in deliberation, Becket
went to church, and &s;aid ma&s;s, where he had previou&s;ly
ordered, that the introit to the communion &s;ervice &s;hould
begin with the&s;e words, <HI>Princes &s;at and &s;pake again&s;t me;</HI>
the pa&s;&s;age appointed for the martyrdom of St. Stephen,
whom the primate thereby tacitly pretended to re&s;emble
in his &s;ufferings for the &s;ake of righteou&s;ne&s;s<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 53. Hoveden, p. 494. Neubr. p. 394. Ger|va&s;e, p. 1391.</NOTE>. He went
thence to court arrayed in his &s;acred ve&s;tments; and as
&s;oon as he arrived within the palace gates, he took the
cro&s;s into his own hands, bore it aloft as his protection,
<PB N="429" REF="469">
and marched in that po&s;ture into the royal apartments<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 40. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 53. Hoveden, p. 494. Neubr. p. 394. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 43.</NOTE>.
The King, who was in an inner room, was a&s;toni&s;hed
at this parade, by which the primate &s;eemed to menace
him and his court with the &s;entence of excommunica|tion;
and he &s;ent &s;ome of the prelates to remon&s;trate
with him on account of &s;uch audacious behaviour.
The&s;e prelates complained to him, that, by &s;ub&s;cribing,
him&s;elf, to the con&s;titutions of Clarendon, he had &s;edu|ced
them to imitate his example; and that now, when
it was too late, he pretended to &s;hake off all &s;ubordina|tion
to the civil power, and appeared de&s;irous of invol|ving
them in the guilt, which mu&s;t attend any violation
of tho&s;e laws, e&s;tabli&s;hed by their con&s;ent and ratified
by their &s;ub&s;criptions<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 35.</NOTE>. Becket replied, that he had in|deed &s;ub&s;cribed the con&s;titutions of Clarendon, <HI>legally,
with good faith and without fraud or re&s;erve,</HI> but in the&s;e
words was virtually implied a &s;alvo for the rights of their
order, which, being connected with the cau&s;e of God
and his church, could never be relinqui&s;hed by their
oaths and engagements: That if he and they had erred,
in re&s;igning the eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, the be&s;t atone|ment
they could now make was to retract their con&s;ent,
which in &s;uch a ca&s;e could never be obligatory, and to
follow the Pope's authority, who had &s;olemnly abrogated
the con&s;titutions of Clarendon, and had ab&s;olved them
from all oaths, which they had taken to ob&s;erve them:
That a determined re&s;olution was evidently embraced to
oppre&s;s the church; the &s;torm had fir&s;t broke upon him;
for a &s;light offence, and which too was even fal&s;ly imput|ed
to him, he had been tyrannically condemned to a
grievous penalty; a new and unheard of claim was &s;ince
&s;tarted, in which he could expect no ju&s;tice; and he
<PB N="430" REF="470">
plainly &s;aw that he was the de&s;tined victim, who, by his
ruin, mu&s;t prepare the way for the abrogation of all
&s;piritual immunities: That he &s;trictly inhibited them,
who were his &s;uffragans, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at any &s;uch trial, or
give their &s;anction to any &s;entence again&s;t him; he put
him&s;elf and his &s;ee under the protection of the &s;upreme
pontiff; and appealed to him again&s;t any penalty, which
his iniquitous judges might think proper to inflict upon
him: And that, however terrible the indignation of &s;o
great a monarch as Henry, his &s;word could only kill the
body, while that of the church, entru&s;ted into the hands
of the primate, could kill the &s;oul, and throw the di&s;|obedient
into infinite and eternal perdition<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 42. 44, 45, 46. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 57. Hoveden, p. 495. M. Paris, p. 72. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 45. 195.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>APPEALS to the Pope, even in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es,
had been aboli&s;hed by the con&s;titutions of Clarendon,
and were become criminal by law; but an appeal in a civil
cau&s;e, &s;uch as that of the King's demand upon Becket,
was a practice altogether new and unprecedented; tended
directly to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the government; and could
receive no colour of excu&s;e, except from the determined
re&s;olution, which was but too apparent, in the King and
the great council, to effectuate, without ju&s;tice, but un|der
colour of law, the total ruin of the inflexible pri|mate.
The King, having now obtained &s;o much a bet|ter
pretext for his violence, would probably have pu&s;hed
this affair to the utmo&s;t extremity again&s;t him; but
Becket gave him no lei&s;ure to conduct that pro&s;ecution.
He refu&s;ed &s;o much as to hear the &s;entence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bani&s;h|ment of Becket.</NOTE> which the
barons, &s;itting apart from the bi&s;hops, and joined to &s;ome
$heriffs and barons of the &s;econd rank<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 46. This hi&s;torian is &s;uppo&s;ed to mean the more con&s;iderable va&s;&s;als of the chief barons: The&s;e had no title to &s;it in the great council, and the giving them a place there was a palpable irregu|larity: Which however is not in&s;i&s;ted on in any of Becket's remon|&s;trances. A new proof how little fixed the con&s;titution was at that time!</NOTE>, had given upon
<PB N="431" REF="471">
the King's claim: He departed from the palace; a&s;ked
Henry's immediate permi&s;&s;ion to leave Northampton;
and upon meeting with a refu&s;al, he withdrew &s;ecretly;
wandered about in di&s;gui&s;e for &s;ome time; and at la&s;t
took &s;hipping and arrived &s;afely at Gravelines<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 60. 63, 64, &amp;c. Hoveden, p. 495. M. Paris, p. 72. Gerva&s;e, p. 1393.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE violent and unju&s;t pro&s;ecution of Becket had a
natural tendency to turn the public favour on his &s;ide,
and to make men forget his former ingratitude towards
the King, and his departure from all oaths and engage|ments,
as well as the enormity of tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical
privileges, of which he affected to be the champion.
There were many other rea&s;ons, which procured him
countenance and protection in foreign countries. Philip,
earl of Flanders<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 35.</NOTE>, and Lewis, King of France<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 36, 37.</NOTE>, jealous
of the ri&s;ing greatne&s;s of Henry, were well plea&s;ed to
give him di&s;turbance in his government; and forgetting
that this was the common cau&s;e of princes, they affected
to pity extremely the condition of the exiled primate;
and the latter even honoured him with a vi&s;it at Soi&s;&s;ons,
in which city he had invited him to fix his retreat<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 76.</NOTE>. The
pope, who&s;e intere&s;ts were more immediately concerned
in &s;upporting him, gave a bad reception to a magnificent
emba&s;&s;y, which Henry &s;ent to accu&s;e him; while he
put the greate&s;t marks of di&s;tinction on Becket him&s;elf,
who had come to Sens, in order to ju&s;tify his cau&s;e before
the &s;overeign pontiff<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 51. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 72, 73. 77. Hoveden, p. 496. Gerva&s;e, p. 1393. Trivet, p. 46.</NOTE>. The King, in revenge, &s;e|que&s;tered
<PB N="432" REF="472">
the revenues of Canterbury; and by a conduct,
which might be e&s;teemed arbitrary, had there been at that
time any regular check on royal authority, he bani&s;hed
all the primate's relations and dome&s;tics, to the number
of four hundred<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 766.</NOTE>, whom he obliged to &s;wear, before their
departure, that they would in&s;tantly join their patron<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 51, 52. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 82.</NOTE>.
But this policy, by which Henry endeavoured to reduce
Becket &s;ooner to nece&s;&s;ities, lo&s;t its effect: The Pope,
as &s;oon as they arrived beyond &s;ea, ab&s;olved them from
their oath, and di&s;tributed them among the convents in
France and Flanders: A re&s;idence was a&s;&s;igned to Becket
him&s;elf in the convent of Pontigny<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 72.</NOTE>, where he lived for
&s;ome years in great magnificence, partly from a pen&s;ion
granted him on the revenues of that abbey, partly from
remittances made him by the French monarch.</P>
<P>THE more to ingratiate him&s;elf with Pope Alexander,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1165.</NOTE>
Becket re&s;igned into his hands the &s;ee of Canterbury, to
which, he affirmed, he had been uncanonically elected,
by the authority of the royal mandate<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 52. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 79.</NOTE>; and Alexander
in his turn, be&s;ides inve&s;ting him anew with that digni|ty,
pretended to abrogate by a bull the &s;entence which
the great council of England had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him.
Henry, after attempting in vain to procure a conference
with the Pope, who departed &s;oon after for Rome, whi|ther
the pro&s;perous condition of his affairs now invited
him; made provi&s;ions again&s;t the con&s;equences of that
breach, which impended between his kingdom and the
apo&s;tolic &s;ee. He i&s;&s;ued orders to his ju&s;ticiaries, inhi|biting,
under &s;evere penalties, all appeals to the Pope
or archbi&s;hop; forbidding any one to receive any man|dates
<PB N="433" REF="473">
from them, or apply in any ca&s;e to their autho|rity;
declaring it trea&s;onable to bring from either of
them an interdict upon the kingdom, and puni&s;hable, in
&s;ecular clergymen, by the lo&s;s of their eyes and by ca&s;tra|tion,
in regulars by amputation of their feet, and in
laics with death; and menacing with &s;eque&s;tration and
bani&s;hment the per&s;ons them&s;elves, as well as their
kindred, who &s;hould pay obedience to any &s;uch inter|dict:
And he farther obliged all his &s;ubjects to &s;wear to
the ob&s;ervance of the&s;e orders<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 88. 167. Hoveden, p. 496. M. Paris, p. 73.</NOTE>. The&s;e were edicts of
the utmo&s;t importance, affected the lives and properties
of all the &s;ubjects, and even changed, for the time, the
national religion, by breaking off all communication
with Rome: Yet were they enacted by the &s;ole autho|rity
of the King, and were derived entirely from his
will and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE &s;piritual powers, which, in the primitive church,
were, in a great mea&s;ure, dependant on the civil, had
by a gradual progre&s;s reached an equality and inde|pendance;
and tho' the limits of the two juri&s;dictions
were difficult to a&s;certain or define, it was not impo&s;&s;ible,
but, by moderation on both &s;ides, government might
&s;till have been conducted, in that imperfect and irregular
manner which attends all human in&s;titutions. But as the
ignorance of the age encouraged the eccle&s;ia&s;tics daily
to extend their privileges, and even to advance maxims
totally incompatible with civil government<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Quis dubitet,</HI> &s;ays Becket to the King, <HI>&s;acerdotes Chri&s;ti regum et prin|cipum omniumque fidelium patres et magi&s;tros cen&s;eri.</HI> Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 97. 148.</NOTE>; Henry had
thought it high time to put an end to their preten&s;ions,
and formally, in a public council, to fix tho&s;e powers,
which belonged to the magi&s;trate, and which he was
for the future determined to maintain. In this attempt,
<PB N="434" REF="474">
he was led to recall cu&s;toms, which, tho' antient<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 34. Hoveden, p. 518. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 265.</NOTE>, were
beginning to be aboli&s;hed by a contrary practice, and
which were &s;till more &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by the prevailing
opinions and &s;entiments of the age. Principle, therefore,
&s;tood on the one &s;ide; power on the other; and if the

pre&s;ent intere&s;t, the controver&s;y mu&s;t &s;oon, by the gene|ral

again&s;t him. Becket, in order to forward this event,
filled all places with exclamations again&s;t the violence
which he had &s;uffered<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 53. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 63, 64. 226.</NOTE>. He compared him&s;elf to Chri&s;t,

was crucified anew in the pre&s;ent oppre&s;&s;ions under

God<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 29, 30, 31. 226.</NOTE>: He a&s;&s;umed the character of champion for the

father of the King and all the people of England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 46. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 52. 148.</NOTE>:.
He even told Henry, that kings reign &s;olely by the autho|rity

veil more openly on the one &s;ide, than that prince had

borne him by the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, to have all the advantages

&s;u&s;pended the payment of Peter's-pence<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 219.</NOTE>; he made ad|vances

<P>THE &s;ituation of Henry was &s;o unhappy, that he could
employ no expedient for &s;aving his mini&s;ters from this

and having recour&s;e to a tribunal, who&s;e authority he had
him&s;elf attempted to abridge in this very article of ap|peals,

not likely to be long effectual. Becket had obtained
from the Pope a legatine commi&s;&s;ion over England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 55. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 179.</NOTE>;
and in virtue of that authority, which admitted of no
appeal<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 218.</NOTE>, he &s;ummoned the bi&s;hops of London, Sali&s;bury,

this &s;entence<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 403, 404. 428.</NOTE>; and he gave the pontiff &s;uch hopes of a

two legates, William de Pavie and Otho, were &s;ent to
Normandy, where the King then re&s;ided, and endea|voured

all the con&s;titutions of Clarendon &s;hould be ratified<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 517. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 345.</NOTE>:
Becket, that, previou&s;ly to any agreement, he and his

the legates had no power to pronounce a definitive &s;en|tence
on either &s;ide, the negotiation &s;oon after came to
nothing<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gerva&s;e, p. 1403.</NOTE>. The cardinal de Pavie al&s;o, being much at|tached
to Henry's intere&s;ts, took care to protract the ne|gotiation;
to mitigate the Pope, by the accounts which
he &s;ent of that prince's conduct; and to procure him
every po&s;&s;ible indulgence from the &s;ee of Rome. It was
<PB N="437" REF="477">
by his credit, that the King obtained about this time a
di&s;pen&s;ation for the marriage of his third &s;on, Geoffrey,
with the heire&s;s of Britanny; a conce&s;&s;ion, which, con|&s;idering
Henry's demerits towards the church, gave great
&s;candal both to Becket, and to his patron, the King of
France.</P>
<P>THE intricacies of the feudal law had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1167.</NOTE> in that age,
rendered the boundaries of power between the prince
and his va&s;&s;als, and between one prince and another, as
precarious as tho&s;e between the crown and the mitre;
and all wars took their origin from di&s;putes, which, had
there been any tribunal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power to enforce
their decrees, ought only to have been decided before a
court of judicature. Henry, in pro&s;ecution of &s;ome con|trover&s;ies,
in which he was involved with the count of
Auvergne, a va&s;&s;al of the dutchy of Guienne, had in|vaded
the territories of that count; who had recour&s;e to
the King of France, his &s;uperior lord, for protection,
and thereby kindled a war between the two monarchs.
But this war was, as u&s;ual, no le&s;s feeble in its opera|tions,
than it was frivolous in its cau&s;e and object; and
after occa&s;ioning &s;ome depredations on each others terri|tories<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 517. M. Paris, p. 75. Diceto, p. 547. Gerva&s;e, p. 1402, 1403. Robert de Monte.</NOTE>, and &s;ome in&s;urrections among the barons of
Poictou and Guienne, was terminated by a peace; the
terms of which were rather di&s;advantageous to Henry,
and prove, that that prince had, by rea&s;on of his conte&s;ts
with the church, lo&s;t the &s;uperiority, which he had
hitherto maintained over the crown of France: An addi|tional
motive to him for accommodating tho&s;e differ|ences.</P>
<P>THE Pope and the King began to perceive, that, in
the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, neither of them could
<PB N="438" REF="478">
expect a final and deci&s;ive victory over the other, and
that they had more to fear than hope from the duration
of the controver&s;y. Tho' the vigour of Henry's govern|ment
had confirmed his authority in all his dominions,
his throne might be &s;haken by a &s;entence of excommuni|cation;
and if England it&s;elf could, by its &s;ituation, be
more ea&s;ily guarded again&s;t the contagion of &s;uper&s;titious
prejudices, his French provinces at lea&s;t, who&s;e commu|nication
was open with the neighbouring &s;tates, would
be much expo&s;ed, on that account, to &s;ome great revo|lution
or convul&s;ion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 230.</NOTE>. He could not, therefore, rea|&s;onably
imagine, that the Pope, while he retained &s;uch
a check upon him, would formally recognize the con&s;ti|tutions
of Clarendon, which both put an end to papal
preten&s;ions in England, and would give an example to
other &s;tates of a&s;&s;erting a like independancy<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 276.</NOTE>. Pope
Alexander, on the other hand, being &s;till engaged in
dangerous wars with the Emperor Frederic, might ju&s;tly
apprehend, that Henry, rather than relinqui&s;h claims of
&s;uch importance, would join the party of his enemy<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 53. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 75.</NOTE>;
and as the trials hitherto made of the &s;piritual weapons
by Becket had not &s;ucceeded to his expectation<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 241. 254.</NOTE>, and
every thing had remained quiet in all the King's domi|nions,
nothing &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to the capacity and vi|gilance
of &s;o great a monarch. The di&s;po&s;ition of minds
on both &s;ides, re&s;ulting from the&s;e circum&s;tances, pro|duced
frequent attempts towards an accommodation; but
as both parties knew, that the e&s;&s;ential articles of the
di&s;pute could not then be terminated, they entertained
a perpetual jealou&s;y of each other, and were anxious not
to lo&s;e the lea&s;t advantage in the negotiation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 85.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="439" REF="479">
nuncios, Gratian and Vivian, having received a commi&s;|&s;ion
to endeavour a reconcilement, met with the King
at Damfront in Normandy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 78.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1168</NOTE> and after all differences
&s;eemed to be adju&s;ted, the King offered to &s;ign the treaty,
with a &s;alvo to his royal dignity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 29. Gerva&s;e, p. 1407.</NOTE>; which gave &s;uch um|brage
to Becket, that the negotiation, in the end, be|came
fruitle&s;s, and the excommunications were renewed
again&s;t the King's mini&s;ters. Another negotiation was
conducted at Montmirail, in the pre&s;ence of the King
of France and the French prelates; where Becket, imi|tating
Henry's example, offered to make his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions,
with a &s;alvo of the honour of God, and the liberties of
the church<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 58. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 95. Diceto, p. 552. Ger|va&s;e, p. 1405.</NOTE>; which, for a like rea&s;on, was extremely
offen&s;ive to the King, and rendered the treaty abortive.
A third conference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1169</NOTE> under the &s;ame mediation, was
broke off, by Becket's in&s;i&s;ting on the like re&s;erve in his
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ions; and even in a fourth treaty, when all the
terms were adju&s;ted, and when the primate expected to
be introduced to the King, and to receive the ki&s;s of
peace, which it was u&s;ual for princes to grant in tho&s;e
times, and which was regarded as a &s;ure pledge of for|givene&s;s,
Henry refu&s;ed him that honour<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 102. M. Paris, p. 82. Gerva&s;e, p. 1408.</NOTE>; upon pre|tence,
that, during his anger, he had made a ra&s;h vow
never to give the prelate &s;uch a te&s;timony of friend&s;hip.
This formality &s;erved, among &s;uch jealous &s;pirits, to
prevent the conclu&s;ion of the treaty; and tho' the dif|ficulty
was attempted to be overcome, by a di&s;pen&s;ation
which the Pope granted Henry from his ra&s;h vow<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 68.</NOTE>,
that prince could not be prevailed on to depart from the

<P>ALL difficulties were at la&s;t adju&s;ted between the par|ties;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1170.</NOTE>
and the King allowed Becket to return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22nd July.</NOTE> on condi|tions

Henry reaped only the advantage of &s;eeing his mini&s;ters

<P>BUT the King attained not even that temporary tran|quillity,
which he had hoped to reap from this expedient.
During the heat of his quarrel with Becket, while he
was every day expecting an interdict to be laid on his
kingdom, and even a &s;entence of excommunication to
be denounced again&s;t his per&s;on, he had thought it pru|dent
to have his &s;on, prince Henry, a&s;&s;ociated with him
in the royalty, and to make him be crowned King, by
the hands of Roger archbi&s;hop of York<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 102, 103. Gerva&s;e, p. 1408.</NOTE>. By this
precaution, he both en&s;ured the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of that prince,
which, con&s;idering the many pa&s;t irregularities in that
point, could not but be e&s;teemed &s;omewhat precarious;
and he pre&s;erved at lea&s;t his family on the throne, if the
&s;entence of excommunication &s;hould have the effect
which he dreaded, and &s;hould make his &s;ubjects renounce
their allegiance to him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 65. Pere Daniel, vol. i. p. 1247.</NOTE>. Tho' this de&s;ign was con|ducted

before it was carried into execution, had got intelligence
of it; and being de&s;irous to ob&s;truct all Henry's mea|&s;ures,
as well as anxious to prevent this affront to him|&s;elf,
who pretended a &s;ole right, as archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury,
<PB N="442" REF="482">
to officiate in the coronation, he had inhibited
all the prelates of England from a&s;&s;i&s;ting at this cere|mony<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 684. 686.</NOTE>, had procured a mandate to the &s;ame purpo&s;e

prote&s;t again&s;t the coronation of young Henry, unle&s;s
the prince&s;s, daughter of that monarch, &s;hould at the &s;ame
time receive the royal unction. There prevailed in that
age an opinion, which was akin to its other &s;uper&s;titions,
that the royal unction was e&s;&s;ential to the exerci&s;e of royal
power<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 708.</NOTE>; and it was therefore natural both for the King
of France, careful of his daughter the prince&s;s Mar|garet's
e&s;tabli&s;hment<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1061.</NOTE>, and for Becket, jealous of his
own dignity, to demand, in the treaty with Henry, &s;ome
&s;atisfaction in this e&s;&s;ential point<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Gerva&s;e, p. 1408.</NOTE>. Henry, after apolo|gizing
to Lewis for the omi&s;&s;ion with regard to Marga|ret,
and excu&s;ing it on account of the &s;ecrecy requi&s;ite
for conducting that mea&s;ure, promi&s;ed that the ceremony
&s;hould be again renewed in the per&s;ons both of the prince
and prince&s;s<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 518.</NOTE>: And he a&s;&s;ured Becket, that, be&s;ides re|ceiving
the acknowledgments of Roger and the other
bi&s;hops for the &s;eeming affront put on the &s;ee of Canter|bury,
he &s;hould, as a farther &s;atisfaction, recover his
rights by officiating in this coronation<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 803, 810.</NOTE>. But the violent
&s;pirit of Becket, elated by the power of the church, and
by the victory which he had already obtained over his &s;o|vereign,
was not content with this voluntary compen&s;a|tion,
but re&s;olved to make the injury, which he pretended
to have &s;uffered, a handle for taking revenge of all his
enemies. On his arrival in England, he met the arch|bi&s;hop
of York and the bi&s;hops of London and Sali&s;bury,
<PB N="443" REF="483">
who were on their journey to the King in Normandy;
and he notified to the archbi&s;hop the &s;entence of &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion,
and to the two bi&s;hops that of excommunication,
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Becket's return from bani&s;h|ment.</NOTE> at his &s;olicitation, the Pope had pronounced

hymns of joy his triumphant entrance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 75. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 117.</NOTE>. And tho' he
was obliged, by orders of the young prince, who re&s;ided

he was not mi&s;taken, when he laid his account with the
highe&s;t veneration of the public towards his per&s;on and
his dignity. He proceeded, therefore, with the more
courage to launch his &s;piritual thunders; and he i&s;&s;ued
the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t Robert de
Broc<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 520. Diceto, p. 555.</NOTE>, and Nigel de Sackville, with many of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable prelates and mini&s;ters, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at
the coronation of the young prince, and had been active
in the late per&s;ecution of the exiled clergy. This vio|lent
<PB N="444" REF="484">
mea&s;ure, by which he, in effect, denounced war
again&s;t the King him&s;elf, is commonly a&s;cribed to the
vindictive di&s;po&s;ition and imperious character of Becket;
but as this prelate was al&s;o a man of acknowledge
abilities, we are not, in his pa&s;&s;ions alone, to look for
the cau&s;e of his conduct, when he proceeded to the&s;e ex|tremities
again&s;t his enemies. His &s;agacity had led him
to di&s;cover all Henry's intentions; and he purpo&s;ed, by
this bold and unexpected a&s;&s;ault, to prevent the execu|tion
of them.</P>
<P>THE King, from his experience of the di&s;po&s;itions of
his people, was become &s;en&s;ible, that his enterprize had
been too bold, in e&s;tabli&s;hing the con&s;titutions of Claren|don,
in defining all the branches of royal power, and in
endeavouring to extort from the church of England, as
well as from the Pope, an expre&s;s avowal of the&s;e di&s;|puted
prerogatives. Con&s;cious al&s;o of his own vio|lence,
in attempting to break or &s;ubdue the inflexible
primate, he was not di&s;plea&s;ed to undo that mea&s;ure,
which had given his enemies &s;uch advantage again&s;t him;
and he was contented, that the controver&s;y &s;hould ter|minate
in that ambiguous manner, which was the utmo&s;t
that princes, in tho&s;e ages, could hope to attain in their
di&s;putes with the &s;ee of Rome. Tho' he dropt, for the
pre&s;ent, the pro&s;ecution of Becket, he &s;till re&s;erved to
him&s;elf the right of maintaining, that the con&s;titutions
of Clarendon, the original ground of the quarrel, were
both the antient cu&s;toms and the pre&s;ent law of the
realm: And tho' he knew, that the papal clergy a&s;|&s;erted
them to be impious in them&s;elves, as well as abro|gated
by the &s;entence of the &s;overeign pontiff, he propo&s;|ed,
in &s;pite of their clamours, &s;teadily to put the&s;e laws
in execution<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 837. 839.</NOTE>, and to tru&s;t to his own ability, and to
the cour&s;e of events, for &s;ucce&s;s in that perilous enter|prize.
<PB N="445" REF="485">
He hoped, that Becket's experience of a &s;ix
years exile would, after his pride was fully gratified by
his re&s;toration, be &s;ufficient to teach him more re&s;erve in
his oppo&s;ition; or if any controver&s;y aro&s;e, he expected
thenceforth to engage in a more favourable cau&s;e, and
to maintain with advantage, while the primate was now
in his power<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 65.</NOTE>, the antient and undoubted cu&s;toms of
the kingdom again&s;t the u&s;urpations of the clergy. But
Becket, determined not to betray the eccle&s;ia&s;tical privi|leges
by his connivance<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 345.</NOTE>, and apprehen&s;ive le&s;t a prince
of &s;uch profound policy, if allowed to proceed in his
own way, would probably in the end prevail, re&s;olved to
take all the advantage which his pre&s;ent victory gave
him, and to di&s;concert the cautious mea&s;ures of the
King, by the vehemence and rigour of his own con|duct<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 74.</NOTE>. A&s;&s;ured of &s;upport from Rome, he was little
apprehen&s;ive of dangers, which his courage taught him

that his whole plan of operations was overthrown; fore|&s;aw,
that the dangerous conte&s;t between the civil and

thrown into the mo&s;t violent commotion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 119. Neubr. p. 401. Trivet, p. 52.</NOTE>. The arch|bi&s;hop

lived, he could never expect to enjoy peace or tranquil|lity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fitz-Steph. p. 78.</NOTE>;
and the King him&s;elf, being vehemently agitated,
bur&s;t forth into an exclamation again&s;t his &s;ervants,

This was the tragical end of Thomas a Becket, a pre|late
of the mo&s;t lofty, intrepid, and inflexible &s;pirit,
who was able to cover, to the world and probably to
him&s;elf, the enterprizes of pride and ambition, under
the di&s;gui&s;e of &s;anctity and of zeal for the intere&s;ts of
piety and religion: An extraordinary per&s;onage, &s;urely,
had he been allowed to remain in his fir&s;t &s;tation, and
had directed the vehemence of his character to the &s;up|port
of law and ju&s;tice; in&s;tead of being engaged, by
the prejudices of the times, to &s;acrifice all private duties
and public connexions to tyes, which he imagined, or
repre&s;ented, as &s;uperior to every civil and political con|&s;ideration.
But no man, who enters into the genius of
that age, can rea&s;onably doubt of this prelate's &s;incerity.
The &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition was &s;o prevalent, that it in|fallibly
caught every carele&s;s rea&s;oner, much more every
one who&s;e intere&s;t, and honour, and ambition, were en|gaged
to &s;upport it. All the wretched literature of the
times was inli&s;ted on that &s;ide: Some faint glimmerings
of common &s;en&s;e might &s;ometimes pierce thro' the thick
cloud of ignorance, or what was wor&s;e, the illu&s;ions of
perverted &s;cience, which had blotted out the &s;un, and
envelloped the face of nature: But tho&s;e who pre&s;erved
them&s;elves untainted from the general contagion, pro|ceeded
on no principles which they could pretend to
ju&s;tify: They were beholden more to their total want
of in&s;truction, than to their knowledge, if they &s;till re|tained
&s;ome &s;hare of under&s;tanding: Folly was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of all the &s;chools as well as all the churches; and her
votaries a&s;&s;umed the garb of philo&s;ophers together with
the en&s;igns of &s;piritual dignities. Throughout that large
collection of letters, which bears the name of St. Tho|mas,
we find, in all the retainers of that a&s;piring pre|late,
no le&s;s than in him&s;elf, a mo&s;t entire and ab&s;olute
conviction of the rea&s;on and piety of their own party,
<PB N="448" REF="488">
and a di&s;dain of their antagoni&s;ts; nor is there le&s;s cant
and grimace in their &s;tile, when they addre&s;s each other,
than when they compo&s;e manife&s;tos for the peru&s;al of the
public. The &s;pirit of revenge, violence, and ambition,
which accompanied their conduct, in&s;tead of forming a
pre&s;umption of hypocri&s;y, are the &s;ure&s;t pledges of their
&s;incere attachment to a cau&s;e, which &s;o much ftattered
the&s;e domineering pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>HENRY, on the fir&s;t report of Becket's violent mea|&s;ures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grief</NOTE>
had propo&s;ed to have him arre&s;ted, and had al|ready
taken &s;ome &s;teps towards the execution of that
de&s;ign: But the intelligence of his murder threw that
prince into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and he was imme|diately
&s;en&s;ible of the dangerous con|equences,
which he had rea&s;on to apprehend from &s;o unexpected an event.
An archbi&s;hop of reputed &s;anctity, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated before the
altar, in the exerci&s;e of his function, and on account of
his zeal in maintaining eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, mu&s;t at|tain
the highe&s;t honours of martyrdom; while his mur|derer
would be ranked among the mo&s;t bloody tyrants,
that ever were expo&s;ed to the hatred and dete&s;tation of
mankind. Interdicts and excommunications, weapons
in them&s;elves &s;o terrible, would, he fore&s;aw, be armed
with double force; when employed in a cau&s;e &s;o much
calculated to work on the human pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;o pecu|liarly
adapted to the eloquence of popular preachers and
declaimers. In vain would he plead his own innocence,
and even his total ignorance of the fact: He was &s;uffi|ciently
guilty, if the church thought proper to e&s;teem
him &s;o: And his concurrence in Becket's martyrdom,
becoming a religious opinion, would be received with all
the implicit credit, which belonged to the mo&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
articles of faith. The&s;e con&s;iderations gave the
King the mo&s;t unaffected concern; and as it was ex|tremely
his intere&s;t to clear him&s;elf of all &s;u&s;picion, he
<PB N="449" REF="489">
took no care to conceal the depth of his affliction<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 447. M. Paris, p. 87. Diceto, p. 556. Ger|va&s;e, p. 1419.</NOTE>.
He &s;hut him&s;elf up from the light of day and from all
commerce with his &s;ervants: He even refu&s;ed during
three days all food and &s;u&s;tenance<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 143.</NOTE>: The courtiers, ap|prehending
dangerous effects from his de&s;pair, were at
la&s;t obliged to break in upon his &s;olitude; and they em|ployed
every topic of con&s;olation, induced him to ac|cept
of nouri&s;hment, and occupied his lei&s;ure in taking
precautions again&s;t the con&s;equences, which he &s;o ju&s;tly
apprehended from the murder of the primate.</P>
<P>THE point of chief importance to Henry was to con|vince
the Pope of his innocence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1171.</NOTE> or rather to per&s;uade
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion of the King.</NOTE> that he would reap greater advantages from the
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of England than from proceeding to extre|mities
again&s;t that kingdom. The archbi&s;hop of Ro&uuml;en,
the bi&s;hops of Worce&s;ter and Evreux, with five others
of le&s;s quality, were immediately di&s;patched to Rome<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 526. M, Paris, p. 87.</NOTE>,
and orders were given them to perform their journey
with the utmo&s;t expedition. Tho' the name and au|thority
of the court of Rome were &s;o terrible in the re|mote
countries of Europe, which were &s;unk in profound
ignorance, and were entirely unacquainted with its cha|racter
and conduct; the Pope was &s;o little revered at
home, that his inveterate enemies &s;urrounded the gates
of Rome it&s;elf, and even controuled his government in
that city; and the amba&s;&s;adors, who, from a di&s;tant
extremity of Europe, carried to him the humble, or ra|ther
abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of the greate&s;t potentate of the
age, found the utmo&s;t difficulty to make their way to
him, and to throw them&s;elves at his feet. It was at la&s;t
agreed, that Richard Barre, one of their number, &s;hould
leave the re&s;t behind, and run all the hazards of the
<PB N="450" REF="490">
pa&s;&s;aged<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 526. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 863.</NOTE>, in order to prevent the fatal con&s;equences
which might en&s;ue from any delay in giving &s;atisfaction
to his Holine&s;s. He found on his arrival, that Alex|ander
was already wrought up to the greate&s;t rage again&s;t
the King, that Becket's partizans were daily &s;timulat|ing
him to revenge, that the King of France had ex|horted
him to fulminate the mo&s;t dreadful &s;entence again&s;t
England<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 52$. Spel. Concil. vol. ii p. 89. Brompton, p. 1065. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 855. Benedictus Abba&s;. p. 13.</NOTE>, and that the very mention of Henry's name
before the &s;acred college was received with every ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of horror and execration<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 526. Neubr. p. 402. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 864.</NOTE>. The Thur&s;day be|fore
Ea&s;ter was now approaching, when it is cu&s;tomary
for the Pope to denounce annual cur&s;es again&s;t all his
enemies; and it was expected, that Henry &s;hould, with
all the preparations peculiar to the di&s;charge of that &s;a|cred
artillery, be &s;olemnly comprehended in the number<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 527. Diceto, p. 556. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 864.</NOTE>.
But Barre found means to appea&s;e the pontiff, and to
deter him from a mea&s;ure, which, if it failed of &s;ucce&s;s,
could not afterwards be ea&s;ily recalled: The anathemas
were only levelled in general again&s;t all the actors, ac|complices,
and abettors of Becket's murder<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Gerva&s;e, p. 1419.</NOTE>; and the
abbot of Vala&s;&s;e, and the archdeacons of Sali&s;bury and Li&s;ieux,
with others of Henry's mini&s;ters, who &s;oon af|ter
arrived, be&s;ides maintaining their prince's inno|cence,
made oath before the whole con&s;i&s;tory, that he
would &s;tand to the Pope's judgment in the affair, and
make every &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that &s;hould be required of him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 557. Gerva&s;e, p. 1419. Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 865. 867.</NOTE>.
The terrible blow was thus artfully eluded; the cardi|nals
Albert and Theodin were appointed legates to ex|amine
the cau&s;e, and were ordered to proceed to Nor|mandy
<PB N="451" REF="491">
for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 526. Neubr. p. 402. Gerva&s;e, p. 1419. Hi&s;t. Quad. p. 147.</NOTE>; and tho' Henry's foreign do|minions
were already laid under an interdict by the arch|bi&s;hop
of Sens, Becket's great partizan<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 523. Spelm. Concil. vol. ii. p. 90.</NOTE>, and the
Pope's legate in France, the expectation, that the mo|narch
would ea&s;ily exculpate him&s;elf from any concur|rence
in the guilt, kept every one in &s;u&s;pence, and pre|vented
all the bad con&s;equences, which might be dread|ed
from that &s;entence.</P>
<P>THE clergy, mean while, tho' their rage was hap|pily
diverted from falling on the King, were not idle in
magnifying the &s;anctity of Becket; in extolling the me|rits
of his martyrdom; and in magnifying him above all
that devoted tribe, who, in &s;everal ages, had, by their
blood, cemented the fabric of the temple. Other &s;aints
had only borne te&s;timony in their &s;ufferings to the ge|neral
doctrines of Chri&s;tianity; but Becket had &s;acri|ficed
his life to the power and privileges of the clergy;
and this peculiar merit challenged, and not in vain, a
&s;uitable acknowledgment to his memory. Endle&s;s were
the panegyrics on his virtues; and the miracles, ope|rated
by his relicts, were more numerous, more non&s;en|&s;ical,
and more impudently atte&s;ted, than tho&s;e which
ever filled the legend of any confe&s;&s;or or martyr. Two
years after his death he was canonized by Pope Alex|ander<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. St. Thom. p. 880. Diceto, p. 569.</NOTE>; a &s;olemn jubilee was e&s;tabli&s;hed for celebrating
his merits; his body was removed to a magnificent
&s;hrine, enriched with pre&s;ents from all parts of Chri&s;|tendom;
pilgrimages were performed to obtain his in|terce&s;&s;ion
with heaven; and it was computed, that, in
one year, above an hundred thou&s;and pilgrims arrived in
Canterbury, and paid their devotions at his tomb. It
<PB N="452" REF="492">
is indeed a mortifying reflection to tho&s;e who are actu|ated
by the love of fame, &s;o ju&s;tly denominated the la&s;t
infirmity of noble minds, that the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lator and
mo&s;t exalted genius, that ever reformed or enlightened
the world, can never expect &s;uch tributes of prai&s;e, as
are lavi&s;hed on the memory of a pretended &s;aint, who&s;e
whole conduct was probably, to the la&s;t degree, odious
or contemptible, and who&s;e indu&s;try was entirely direct|ed
to the pur&s;uits of objects pernicious to mankind. It
is only a conqueror, a per&s;onage no le&s;s intitled to our
hatred, who can pretend to the attainment of equal re|nown
and glory.</P>
<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to remark, before we conclude
this &s;ubject of Thomas a Becket, that the King, during
his controver&s;y with that prelate, was on every occa&s;ion
more anxious than u&s;ual to expre&s;s his zeal for religion,
and to avoid all appearance of a profane negligence on
that head. He gave his con&s;ent to the impo&s;ing a tax
on all his dominions for the delivery of the holy land,
now threatened by the famous Saladine; and this tax
amounted to two-pence a pound for one year, and a
penny a pound for the four &s;ub&s;equent<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. Gerva&s;e, p. 1399. M. Paris, p. 74.</NOTE>. Almo&s;t all
the princes of Europe laid a like impo&s;ition on their &s;ub|jects,
which received the name of Saladine's tax. Dur|ing
this period, there came over from Germany about
thirty heretics of both &s;exes, under the direction of
one Gerard; &s;imple ignorant people, who could give no
account of their faith, but declared them&s;elves ready to
&s;uffer for the tenets of their ma&s;ter. They made only
one convert in England, a woman as ignorant as them|&s;elves;
yet they gave &s;uch umbrage to the clergy, that
they were delivered over to the &s;ecular arm, and were
puni&s;hed by being burned on the forehead, and then
whipped thro' the &s;treets. They &s;eemed to exult in
<PB N="453" REF="493">
their &s;ufferings, and as they went along, &s;ung the bea|titude,
<HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye, when men hate you and per&s;ecute you</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Neubr. p. 391. M. Paris, p. 74. Heming. p. 494.</NOTE>.
After they were whipped, they were thru&s;t out almo&s;t
naked in the mid&s;t of winter, and peri&s;hed thro' cold
and hunger; no one daring, or being willing, to give
them the lea&s;t relief. We are ignorant of the particu|lar
principles of the&s;e people: For it would be imprudent
to rely on the repre&s;entations left of them by the clergy,
who affirm, that they denied the efficacy of the &s;acra|ments,
and the unity of the church. It is probable,
that their departure from the &s;tandard of orthodoxy was
&s;till more &s;ubtile and minute. They &s;eem to have been
the fir&s;t that ever &s;uffered for here&s;y in England.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as Henry found, that he was in no immedi|ate
danger from the thunders of the vatican, he under|took
an expedition again&s;t Ireland; a de&s;ign, which he
had long projected, and by which he hoped to recover
his credit, &s;omewhat impaired in his late tran&s;actions
with the hierarchy.</P>

that lies far beyond the records of any hi&s;tory or tradi|tion.
The Iri&s;h, from the beginning of time, had been
buried in the mo&s;t profound barbari&s;m and ignorance;
and as they were never conquered or even invaded by
the Romans, from whom all the we&s;tern world derived
its civility, they continued &s;till in the mo&s;t rude &s;tate of
&s;ociety, and were di&s;tingui&s;hed only by tho&s;e vices, to
which human nature, not tamed by education nor re|&s;trained
by laws, is for ever &s;ubject. The &s;mall princi|palities,
<PB N="455" REF="495">
into which they were divided, exerci&s;ed perpe|tual
rapine and violence again&s;t each other; the uncer|tain
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their princes was a continued &s;ource
of dome&s;tic convul&s;ions; the u&s;ual title of each petty
&s;overeign was the murder of his predece&s;&s;or; courage
and force, tho' exerci&s;ed in the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes,
were more honoured than any pacific virtues; and the
mo&s;t &s;imple arts of life, even tillage and agriculture,
were almo&s;t wholly unknown among them. They had
felt the inva&s;ions of the Danes and the other northern
people; but the&s;e inroads, which had &s;pread barbari&s;m
in the other parts of Europe, tended rather to improve
the Iri&s;h; and the only towns, which were to be found
in the i&s;land, had been planted along the coa&s;t by the
freebooters of Norway and Denmark. The other in|habitants
exerci&s;ed pa&s;turage in the open country; &s;ought
protection from any danger in their fore&s;ts and mora&s;|&s;es;
and being divided by the fierce&s;t animo&s;ities again&s;t
each other, were &s;till more intent on the means of mu|tual
injury, than on the expedients for common or even
for private intere&s;t.</P>
<P>BESIDES many &s;mall tribes, there were in the age of
Henry II. five principal &s;overeignties in the i&s;land, Mun|&s;ter,
Lein&s;ter, Meath, Ul&s;ter, and Connaught; and as
it had been u&s;ual for one or the other of the&s;e to take
the lead in their wars, there was commonly &s;ome prince,
who &s;eemed, for the time, to act as monarch of Ire|land.
Roderic O Connor, King of Connaught, was
then advanced to this dignity<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 527.</NOTE>; but his government, ill
obeyed even within his own territory, was not capable
of uniting the people in any mea&s;ures, either for the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of order, or for defence again&s;t foreigners.
The ambition of Henry had, very early in his reign,
been moved, by the pro&s;pect of the&s;e advantages, to at|tempt
<PB N="456" REF="496">
the &s;ubjection of Ireland; and a pretence was only
wanting to invade a people, who, being always confined
to their own i&s;land, had never given any rea&s;on of com|plaint
to any of their neighbours. For this purpo&s;e, he
had recour&s;e to Rome, which a&s;&s;umed a right to di&s;po&s;e
of kingdoms and empires; and not fore&s;eeing the dan|gerous
di&s;putes, which he was one day to maintain
with that &s;ee, he helped, for pre&s;ent, or rather for an
imaginary convenience, to give &s;anction to claims which
were now become dangerous to all &s;overeigns. Adrian
III. who was then pontiff, was by birth an Engli&s;h|man;
and being, on that account, di&s;po&s;ed to oblige
Henry, he was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to act as ma&s;ter of the
world, and to make, without any hazard or expence,
the acqui&s;ition of a great i&s;land to his &s;piritual juri&s;dic|tion.
The Iri&s;h had, by precedent mi&s;&s;ions from the
Britains, been imperfectly converted to Chri&s;tianity;
and what the Pope regarded as the &s;ure&s;t mark of their
imperfect conver&s;ion, they followed the doctrines of their
fir&s;t teachers, and had never acknowledged any &s;ubjec|tion
to the &s;ee of Rome. Adrian, therefore, in the year
1156, i&s;&s;ued a bull in favour of Henry; in which, after
premi&s;ing, that that prince had ever &s;hown an anxious
care to enlarge the church of God on earth, and to en|crea&s;e
the number of his &s;aints and elect in heaven; he
repre&s;ents his de&s;ign of &s;ubduing Ireland as derived from
the &s;ame pious motives: He con&s;iders his care of ap|plying
previou&s;ly for the apo&s;tolic &s;anction as a &s;ure ear|ne&s;t
of &s;ucce&s;s and victory; and having e&s;tabli&s;hed it as
a point inconte&s;tible, that all Chri&s;tian kingdoms be|long
to the patrimony of St. Peter, he acknowledges it
to be his own duty to &s;ow among them the &s;eeds of the
go&s;pel, which might in the la&s;t day fructify to their
eternal &s;alvation: He exhorts the King to invade Ire|land,
in order to extirpate the vice and wickedne&s;s of
the natives, and oblige them to pay yearly, from every
<PB N="457" REF="497">
hou&s;e, a penny to the &s;ee of Rome: He gives him entire
right and authority over the i&s;land, commands all the
inhabitants to obey him as their &s;overeign, and inve&s;ts
with full power all &s;uch godly in&s;truments as he &s;hould
think proper to employ in an enterprize, thus calcu|lated
for the glory of God and the &s;alvation of the &s;ouls
of men<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 67. Girald Cambr. Spelm. Concil. vol. ii. p. 51. Rymer, vol. i. p. 15.</NOTE>. Henry, tho' armed with this authority, did
not immediately put his de&s;ign in execution; but being
detained by more intere&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s on the continent,
waited for a favourable opportunity of invading Ireland.</P>
<P>DERMOT Macmorrogh, King of Lein&s;ter, had, by
his licentious tyranny, rendered him&s;elf extremely odi|ous
to his &s;ubjects, who &s;eized with alacrity, the fir&s;t
occa&s;ion that offered, of throwing off the yoke, which
was become grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive to them. This
prince had formed a de&s;ign on Omach, wife of Ororic,
King of Meath; and taking advantage of her hu&s;band's
ab&s;ence, who, being obliged to vi&s;it a di&s;tant part of

tho' u&s;ual among the Iri&s;h, and rather e&s;teemed a proof

hu&s;band; who, having collected forces, and being
&s;trengthened by the alliance of Roderic, King of Con|naught,
invaded the dominions of Dermot, and expel|led
him from his kingdom. The exiled prince had re|cour&s;e
to Henry, who was at that time in Guienne,
craved his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to re&s;tore him to his &s;overeignty,
and offered, in that ca&s;e, to hold his kingdom in va&s;|&s;alage
of the crown of England. Henry, who&s;e views
were already turned towards making acqui&s;itions in Ire|land,
<PB N="458" REF="498">
readily accepted the offer; but being at that time
embara&s;&s;ed by the rebellions of his French &s;ubjects, as
well as by his di&s;putes with the &s;ee of Rome, he declin|ed
for the pre&s;ent embarking in the enterprize, and gave
Dermot no farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance than letters patent, by
which he empowered all his &s;ubjects to aid the Iri&s;h
prince in the recovery of his dominions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Girlad Cambr. p. 760.</NOTE>. Dermot, &s;up|ported
by this authority, came to Bri&s;tol; and after en|deavouring,
tho' for &s;ome time in vain, to engage ad|venturers
in the enterprize, he at la&s;t formed a treaty
with Richard, &s;irnamed Strongbow, earl of Strigul. This
nobleman, who was of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Clare,
had impaired his e&s;tate by expen&s;ive plea&s;ures; and being
ready for any de&s;perate undertaking, he promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
to Dermot, on condition of his e&s;pou&s;ing Eva, the
daughter of that prince, and being declared heir of all
his dominions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 761.</NOTE>. While Richard was a&s;&s;embling his &s;uc|cours,
Dermot went into Wales; and meeting with
Robert Fitz-Stephens, con&s;table of Abertivi, and Mau|rice
Fitz-Gerald, he al&s;o engaged them in his &s;ervice,
and obtained their promi&s;e of invading Ireland. Being
now a&s;&s;ured of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he returned privately to his
own &s;tate; and lurking in the mona&s;tery of Fernes,
which he had founded, (for this ruffian was al&s;o a foun|der
of mona&s;teries) he prepared every thing for the re|ception
of his Engli&s;h allies<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 761.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE troops of Fitz-Stephens were fir&s;t ready. That
gentleman landed in Ireland with an hundred and thirty
knights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conque&s;t of that i&s;land.</NOTE> &s;ixty e&s;quires, and three hundred archers; but
this &s;mall body, being brave men, not unacquainted
with di&s;cipline, and compleatly armed, a thing almo&s;t
unknown in Ireland, they &s;truck a great terror into the
barbarous inhabitants, and &s;eemed to menace them with
<PB N="459" REF="499">
&s;ome great revolution. The conjunction of Maurice de
Prenderga&s;t, who, about the &s;ame time, brought over
ten knights and &s;ixty archers, enabled Kitz-Stephens to
attempt the &s;iege of Wexford, a town inhabited by the
Danes; and after gaining a battle, he made him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of the place<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 761, 762.</NOTE>. Soon after, Fitz-Gerald arrived
with ten knights, thirty e&s;quires, and a hundred archers<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 766.</NOTE>; and being joined by the former adventurers, compo&s;ed a
force which nothing in Ireland was able to with&s;tand.
Roderic, the chief monarch of the i&s;land, was defeated
in battle; the prince of Offory was obliged to &s;ubmit,
and give ho&s;tages for his peaceable behaviour; and Der|mot,
not content with being re&s;tored to his kingdom of
Lein&s;ter, projected the dethronement of Roderic, and
a&s;pired to the &s;ole dominion of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>IN pro&s;ecution of the&s;e views, he &s;ent over a me&s;&s;en|ger
to the earl of Strigul, challenging the performance
of his promi&s;e, and di&s;playing the mighty advantages
which might now be reaped by a &s;mall reinforcement
of warlike troops from England. Richard, not &s;atisfied
with the general allowance given by Henry to all his
&s;ubjects, went to that prince, then in Normandy; and
having obtained a cold or ambiguous permi&s;&s;ion, pre|pared
him&s;elf for the execution of his de&s;igns. He fir&s;t
&s;ent over Raymond, one of his retinue, with ten knights
and &s;eventy archers, who landing near Waterford, de|feated
a body of three thou&s;and Iri&s;h, that had ventured
to attack him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 767.</NOTE>; and as Richard him&s;elf, who brought
over two hundred hor&s;e, and an hundred archers, joined
in a few days after, the victorious Engli&s;h, they made
them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Waterford, and proceeded to
Dublin, which was taken by a&s;&s;ault. Roderic, in re|venge,
cut off the head of Dermot's &s;on, who had been
<PB N="460" REF="500">
left as a ho&s;tage in his hands; and Richard, marrying
Eva, became &s;oon after, by the death of Dermot, ma&s;ter
of the kingdom of Lein&s;ter, and prepared to extend his
dominion over all Ireland. Roderic, and the other Iri&s;h
princes, were alarmed with the danger; and combining
together, be&s;ieged Dublin with an army of thirty thou|&s;and
men: But earl Richard, making a &s;udden &s;ally at
the head of ninety knights, with their followers, put
this numerous army to rout, chaced them from the field
of battle, and pur&s;ued them with great &s;laughter. No|thing
in Ireland now dared to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Girald Cambr. p. 773.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, jealous of the progre&s;s of his own &s;ubjects,
&s;ent orders to recall all the Engli&s;h, and he made prepa|rations
to attack Ireland in per&s;on<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 770.</NOTE>: But Richard, and
the other adventurers, found means to appea&s;e him, by
making him the mo&s;t humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, and offering
to hold all their acqui&s;itions in va&s;&s;alage to his crown<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 775.</NOTE>.
That monarch landed in Ireland at the head of five hun|dred
knights, be&s;ides other &s;oldiers; and found the Iri&s;h
&s;o di&s;pirited by their late misfortunes, that, in a progre&s;s
which he made thro' the i&s;land, he had no other occu|pation
than to receive the homages of his new &s;ubjects<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 27, 28. Hoveden, p. 527. Diceto, p. 559.</NOTE>.
He left mo&s;t of the Iri&s;h chieftains or princes in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of their antient territories; be&s;towed &s;ome lands on
the Engli&s;h adventurers; gave earl Richard the commi&s;|&s;ion
of &s;ene&s;chal of Ireland; and after a &s;tay of a few
months, returned in triumph into England. By the&s;e
trivial exploits, &s;carce worth relating, except for the
importance of the con&s;equences, was Ireland &s;ubdued,
and annexed for ever to the Engli&s;h crown.</P>
<P>THE low &s;tate of commerce and indu&s;try, during tho&s;e
ages, made it impracticable for princes to &s;upport regular
<PB N="461" REF="501">
armies, which might retain the conquered countries in
&s;ubjection; and the extreme barbari&s;m and poverty of
Ireland could &s;till le&s;s afford means of bearing this ex|pence.
The only expedient by which a durable con|que&s;t
could then be made or maintained, was by pour|ing
in a multitude of new inhabitants, dividing among
them the lands of the vanqui&s;hed, e&s;tabli&s;hing them in all
offices of tru&s;t and authority, and thereby transforming
the antient inhabitants into a new people. By this po|licy,
the northern invaders of old, and of late the duke
of Normandy, had been able to fix their dominion, and
to erect kingdoms, which remained &s;table on their foun|dations,
and were tran&s;mitted to the posterity of the fir&s;t
conquerors. But the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Ireland rendered
that i&s;land &s;o little inviting to the Engli&s;h, that only a
few of de&s;perate fortunes could be per&s;uaded, from time
to time, to tran&s;port them&s;elves into it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1069. Neubrig. p. 403.</NOTE>; and in&s;tead of
reclaiming the natives from their uncultivated manners,
they were gradually a&s;&s;imilated to the antient inhabitants,
and degenerated from the cu&s;toms of their own nation.
It was al&s;o found requi&s;ite to be&s;tow great military and
arbitrary powers on the leaders, who commanded a
handful of men amid&s;t &s;uch ho&s;tile multitudes; and law
and equity, in a little time, became as much unknown
in the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements as they had ever been among
the Iri&s;h tribes. Palatinates were erected in favour of
the new adventurers; independant authority conferred;
the natives, never fully &s;ubdued, &s;till retained their
animo&s;ities again&s;t the conquerors: Their hatred was
retaliated by like injuries; and from the&s;e cau&s;es, the
Iri&s;h, during the cour&s;e of four centuries, remained &s;till
&s;avage and untractable; and it was not till the latter end
of Elizabeth's reign, that the i&s;land was fully &s;ubdued;
<PB N="462" REF="502">
nor till that of her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, that it gave hopes of be|coming
an u&s;eful conque&s;t to the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>BESIDES that the ea&s;y and peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the
Iri&s;h left Henry no farther occupation in that i&s;land, he
was recalled from it by another incident, which was of
the la&s;t importance to his intere&s;ts and &s;afety. The two
legates, Albert and Theodin, to whom was committed
the trial of his conduct in the death of archbi&s;hop
Becket, were arrived in Normandy; and being impa|tient
of delay, &s;ent him frequent letters, full of mena|ces,
if he protracted any longer the making his appear|ance
before them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Girald. Cambr. p. 778.</NOTE>. He ha&s;tened therefore to Normandy,
and had a conference with them a Savigny, where their
fir&s;t demands were &s;o exorbitant, that he broke off the
negotiation, threatened to return to Ireland, and bade
them do their wor&s;t again&s;t him. They perceived, that
the &s;ea&s;on was now pa&s;t for taking advantage of that
tragical incident; which, had it been hotly pur&s;ued by
interdicts and excommunications, was capable of throw|ing
the whole kingdom into combu&s;tion. But the time,
which Henry had happily gained, had contributed to ap|pea&s;e
the minds of men: The event could not now have
the &s;ame influence, as when it was recent; and as the
clergy had every day looked for an accommodation with
the King, they had not oppo&s;ed the preten&s;ions of his
partizans, who had been very indu&s;trious in repre&s;enting
to the people his entire innocence in the murder of the
primate, and his ignorance of the de&s;igns formed by the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The legates, therefore, found them&s;elves obli|ged
to lower their terms; and Henry was &s;o fortunate
as to conclude an accommodation with them. He decla|red
upon oath, before the reliques of the &s;aints, that &s;o
far from commanding or de&s;iring the death of the arch|bi&s;hop,
<PB N="463" REF="503">
he was extremely grieved when he received in|telligence
of it: But as the pa&s;&s;ion which he had ex|pre&s;&s;ed
on account of that prelate's conduct, had pro|bably
given occa&s;ion to his murder, he &s;tipulated the fol|lowing
conditions, as an atonement for the offence. He
promi&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's accommo|dation
with the court of Rome</NOTE> that he &s;hould pardon all &s;uch as had been ba|ni&s;hed
for their adherence to Becket, and &s;hould re&s;tore
them to their livings; that the &s;ee of Canterbury &s;hould
be rein&s;tated in all its antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; that he &s;hould
pay the templars a &s;um of money &s;ufficient for the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance
of two hundred knights during a year in the
holy land; that he &s;hould him&s;elf take the cro&s;s at the
Chri&s;tmas following, and, if the Pope in&s;i&s;ted on it,
&s;erve three years again&s;t the infidels, either in Spain or
in Pale&s;tine; that he &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t on the ob&s;ervance
of &s;uch cu&s;toms, derogatory to eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, as
had been introduced in his own time; and that he &s;hould
not &s;top appeals to the Pope in eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, but
&s;hould content him&s;elf with exacting &s;ufficient &s;ecurity
of the clergy, who left his dominions to pro&s;ecute an
appeal, that they &s;hould attempt nothing again&s;t the
rights of his crown<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 88. Benedict. Abb. p. 34. Hoveden, p. 529. Diceto, p. 560. Chron. Gerv. p. 1422.</NOTE>. Upon &s;igning the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions,
Henry received ab&s;olution from the legates; was con|firmed
in the grant made by Pope Adrian of Ireland<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1071. Liber. Nig. Scac. p. 47.</NOTE>;
and nothing proves more &s;trongly the great abilities of
this monarch, than his extricating him&s;elf, on &s;uch ea&s;y
terms, from &s;o difficult a &s;ituation. He had always in|&s;i&s;ted,
that the laws, e&s;tabli&s;hed at Clarendon, contained
not any new claims, but the antient cu&s;toms of the king|dom;
and he was &s;till at liberty, notwith&s;tanding the
articles of this agreement, to maintain his preten&s;ions.
Appeals to the Pope were indeed permitted by this treaty;
<PB N="464" REF="504">
but as the King was al&s;o permitted to exact rea&s;onable
&s;ecurities from the parties, and might &s;tretch his de|mands
on this head as far as he plea&s;ed, he had it vir|tually
in his power to prevent the Pope from reaping
any advantage by this &s;eeming conce&s;&s;ion. And on the
whole, the con&s;titutions of Clarendon remained &s;till the
law of the realm; tho' the Pope and his legates &s;eem &s;o
little to have conceived the King's power to lie under
any legal limitations, that they were &s;atisfied with his
departing, by treaty, from one of the mo&s;t momen|tous
articles of the&s;e con&s;titutions, without requiring
any repeal by the &s;tates of the kingdom.</P>
<P>HENRY, freed from this dangerous controver&s;y with
the eccle&s;ia&s;tics and with the &s;ee of Rome, &s;eemed now
to have reached the pinnacle of human grandeur and feli|city,
and to be equally happy in his dome&s;tic &s;ituation
and in his political government. A numerous progeny
of &s;ons and daughters gave both lu&s;tre and authority to
his crown, prevented the dangers of a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion,
and repre&s;&s;ed all preten&s;ions of the ambitious barons.
The King's precaution al&s;o, in e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;everal
branches of his family, &s;eemed well calculated to pre|vent
all jealou&s;ies among the brothers, and to perpetuate
the greatne&s;s of his family. He had ordered Henry, his
elde&s;t &s;on, to be anointed King, and had de&s;tined him
to be his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the kingdom of England, the dutchy
of Normandy, and the counties of Anjou, Maine, and
Touraine; territories which lay contiguous, and which,
by that means, might ea&s;ily lend to each other mutual
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, both again&s;t inte&s;tine commotions and foreign
inva&s;ions. Richard, his &s;econd &s;on, was inve&s;ted in the
dutchy of Guienne and county of Poictou; Geoffrey,
his third &s;on, inherited, in right of his wife, the
dutchy of Brittany; and his new conque&s;t of Ireland
was de&s;tined for the appanage of John, his fourth &s;on.
<PB N="465" REF="505">
He had al&s;o negotiated, in favour of this la&s;t prince, a
marriage with Adelais, the only daughter of Humbert,
count of Savoy and Maurienne; and was to receive as
her dowry very con&s;iderable deme&s;nes in Piedmont, Sa|voy,
Bre&s;&s;e, and Dauphiny<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 448. Bened. Abb. p. 38 Hoveden, p. 532. Diceto, p. 561. Brompton, p. 1082. Rymer, vol i. p. 33.</NOTE>. But this exaltation of his
family excited the jealou&s;y and envy of all his neighbours,
who made tho&s;e very ions, who&s;e fortunes he had &s;o
anxiou&s;ly etabli&s;hed, the means of imbittering his future
life and di&s;turbing his government.</P>
<P>YOUNG Henry, who was ri&s;ing to man's e&s;tate, began
to di&s;play his character, and a&s;pire to independance:
Brave, ambitious, liberal, magnificent, affable; he di&s;|covered
qualities, which give great lu&s;tre to youth;
progno&s;ticate a &s;hining fortune; but, unle&s;s tempered in
mature age with di&s;cretion, are the forerunners of the
greate&s;t calamities<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Chron Gerv. p. 1463.</NOTE>. It is &s;aid, that at the time when
this prince was anointed King, his father, in order to
give greater dignity to the ceremony, officiated at table
as one of the retinue; and ob&s;erved to his &s;on, that ne|ver
King was more royally &s;erved. <HI>It is nothing extraor|dinary,</HI>
&s;aid young Henry to one of his courtiers, <HI>if the
&s;on of a count &s;hould &s;erve the &s;on of a King.</HI> This &s;ay|ing,
which might pa&s;s only for an innocent plea&s;antry,
or even for an oblique compliment to his father, was
however regarded as a &s;ymptom of his a&s;piring temper;
and his conduit &s;oon after ju&s;tified the conjecture.</P>
<P>HENRY, agreeable to the promi&s;e which he had given
both to the Pope and the French King, permitted his
&s;on to be crowned anew by the hands of the archbi&s;hop
of Ro&uuml;en, and a&s;&s;ociated the prince&s;s Margaret, &s;pou&s;e
to young Henry, in this ceremony<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 529. Diceto, p. 560. Brompton, p. 1080. Chron. Gerv. p. 1421. Trivet, p. 58.</NOTE>. He afterwards
<PB N="466" REF="506">
allowed him to pay a vi&s;it to his father-in-law at Paris,
who took the opportunity of in&s;piring into the young
prince tho&s;e ambitious &s;entiments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1173.</NOTE> to which he was na|turally

participation of royalty; Lewis per&s;uaded his &s;on-in-law,
that by this ceremony, which in tho&s;e ages was deemed
&s;o momentous, he had acquired a title to &s;overeignty,
and that the King could not, without inju&s;tice, exclude
him from immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole, or at lea&s;t
a part of his dominions. In con&s;equence of the&s;e ex|travagant
ideas, young Henry, on his return, de&s;ired the
King to re&s;ign to him either the crown of England or
the dutchy of Normandy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 37. Hoveden, p. 531. Brompton, p. 1083. Chron. Gerva&s;e, p. 1424.</NOTE>; di&s;covered great di&s;content

<P>WHILE Henry was alarmed with this event, and had
the pro&s;pect of dangerous intrigues, or even of a war,
which, whether &s;ucce&s;sful or not, mu&s;t be extremely ca|lamitous
and di&s;agreeable to him, he received intelligence
of new misfortunes, which mu&s;t have affected him in
the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part. Queen Eleanor, who had di&s;|gu&s;ted
her fir&s;t hu&s;band by her gallantries, was no le&s;s
offen&s;ive to her &s;econd, by her jealou&s;y; and after this
manner, carried to extremity, in the different parts of
her life, every circum&s;tance of female weakne&s;s. She
<PB N="467" REF="507">
communicated her di&s;contents again&s;t Henry to her two
younger &s;ons, Geoffrey and Richard; per&s;uaded them
that they were al&s;o entitled to pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
territories a&s;&s;igned to them; engaged them to fly &s;ecretly
to the court of France<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 48. Brompton, p. 1083. Neubrig. p. 404</NOTE>; and was meditating, her&s;elf, an

for that purpo&s;e; when &s;he was &s;eized by orders

Thus, Europe &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;hment the be&s;t and mo&s;t
indulgent of parents at war with his whole family;
three boys, &s;carce arrived at the age of puberty, require
a great monarch, in the full vigour of his age and height

of the danger attending the interpo&s;ition of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical

enforce any general execution of the laws, had encou|raged
a tribe of banditti to di&s;turb every where the public
peace, to infe&s;t the high roads, to pillage the open
country, and to brave all the efforts of the civil magi|&s;trate,
and even the excommunications of the church,
which were thundered out again&s;t them<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Neubrig. p. 413.</NOTE>. Troops of
them were &s;ometimes inli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of one prince
or baron, &s;ometimes in that of another: They often
acted in an independant manner, under leaders of their
own: The peaceful and indu&s;trious inhabitants, reduced
to poverty by their ravages, were frequently obliged for
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance to betake them&s;elves to a like di&s;orderly cour&s;e
of life: And a continual inte&s;tine war, pernicious to
indu&s;try, as well as to the execution of ju&s;tice, was thus
carried on in the bowels of every kingdom<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Gerv. p. 1461.</NOTE>. The&s;e
de&s;perate ruffians received the name &s;ometimes of Bra|ban&ccedil;ons,
&s;ometimes of Routiers or Cottereaux; but for
what rea&s;on, is not agreed by hi&s;torians: And they formed
a kind of &s;ociety or government among them&s;elves,
which &s;et at defiance all the re&s;t of mankind. The
greate&s;t monarchs were not a&s;hamed, on occa&s;ion, to
have recour&s;e to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and as their habits of
war and deva&s;tation had given them experience, hardi|ne&s;s,
and courage, they generally compo&s;ed the mo&s;t
formidable part of tho&s;e armies, which decided the poli|tical

among the forces levied by Henry's enemies<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Petr. Ble&s;. epi&s;t. 47.</NOTE>; but the
great trea&s;ures ama&s;&s;ed by that prince enabled him to
engage more numerous troops of them in his &s;ervice;
and the &s;ituation of his affairs rendered even &s;uch banditti
the only forces on who&s;e fidelity he could repo&s;e any
confidence. His licentious barons, di&s;gu&s;ted with a vigi|lant

young princes, ignorant of public affairs, remi&s;s in their
conduct, and profu&s;e in their grants<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 570.</NOTE>; and as the King
had en&s;ured to his &s;ons the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to every particular

<P>HOSTILITIES were fir&s;t commenced by the counts of
Flanders and Boulogne on the frontiers of Normandy.
The&s;e princes formed the &s;iege of Aumale, which, by
the treachery of the count of that name, was delivered
into their hands<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 449. Diceto, p. 571.</NOTE>: That nobleman &s;urrendered him&s;elf

<P>IN another quarter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wars and in&s;urrecti|ons.</NOTE> the King of France, being &s;trongly
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his va&s;&s;als, a&s;&s;embled a great army of &s;even
thou&s;and knights and their followers on hor&s;eback, and
<PB N="471" REF="511">
a proportionable number of infantry; and carrying young
Henry along with him, laid &s;iege to Verne&uuml;il, which
was vigorou&s;ly defended by Hugh de Lacy and Hugh de
Beauchamp, the governors<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 534.</NOTE>. After he had lain a month
before the place, the garri&s;on, being &s;traitened for pro|vi&s;ions,
were obliged to capitulate; and they engaged,
if not relieved within three days, to &s;urrender the town,
and to retire into the citadel. On the la&s;t of the&s;e days,
Henry appeared with his army upon the heights above Ver|ne&uuml;il;
and Lewis, dreading an a&s;&s;ault, &s;ent the archbi&s;hop
of Sens and the count of Blois to the Engli&s;h camp, and
de&s;ired that next day &s;hould be appointed for a conference,
in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a general peace, and terminate the
differences between Henry and his &s;ons. The King, who
pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired this agreement, and &s;u&s;pected no
fraud, gave his con&s;ent; but Lewis, that morning,
obliging the garri&s;on to &s;urrender, according to the capi|tulation,
&s;et fire to the place, and began to retire with
his army<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bened. p. 57, 58, &amp;c. Hoveden, p. 535. Diceto, p. 570, 57l, 572. Brompton, p. 1085, 1086, 1087.</NOTE>. Henry, provoked at this artifice, attacked
the rear with vigour, put them to rout, committed &s;ome
&s;laughter, and took &s;everal pri&s;oners. The French army,
as their time of &s;ervice was now expired, immediately
di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into their &s;everal provinces; and left
Henry free to pro&s;ecute his advantages again&s;t his other
enemies.</P>
<P>THE nobles of Brittany, excited by the earl of
Che&s;ter and Ralph de Fougeres, were all in arms; but
their progre&s;s was checked by a body of Braban&ccedil;ons,
which the King, after Lewis's retreat, had &s;ent again&s;t
them. The two armies came to an action near Dol;
where the rebels were defeated, fifteen hundred killed on
the &s;pot, and the leaders, the earl of Che&s;ter and Fou|geres,
<PB N="472" REF="512">
obliged to take &s;helter in the town of Dol<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 63. Hoveden, p. 535.</NOTE>.
Henry ha&s;tened to form the &s;iege of that place, and car|ried
on the attack with &s;uch ardour, that he obliged the
governor and garri&s;on to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners
of war<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Benedict. Abb. p. 64, 65. Hoveden, p. 535. Diceto, p. 574. Neubrig. p. 406. Heming. p. 500. Trivet, p. 61.</NOTE>.
By the&s;e vigorous mea&s;ures and happy &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es,
the in&s;urrections were entirely quelled in Brit|tany;
and the King, being thus fortunate in all quar|ters,
willingly agreed to a conference with Lewis, in
hopes, that his enemies, finding all their mighty efforts
entirely fru&s;trated, would agree to terminate ho&s;tilities
on &s;ome moderate and rea&s;onable conditions.</P>
<P>THE two monarchs met between Trie and Gi&s;ors;
and Henry had here the mortification to &s;ee his three
&s;ons in the retinue of his mortal enemy. As Lewis
had no other pretence for war than &s;upporting the claims
of the&s;e young princes, the King made them &s;uch of|fers
as children ought to be a&s;hamed to in&s;i&s;t on, and
could be extorted from him by nothing but his parental
affection or by the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 539.</NOTE>. He
in&s;i&s;ted only on retaining the &s;overeign authority in all
his dominions; but offered young Henry the half of the
revenues of England, with &s;ome places of &s;urety in that
kingdom; or if he rather cho&s;e to re&s;ide in Normandy,
the half of the revenues of that dutchy, with all tho&s;e
of Anjou. He made a like offer to Richard in Guienne;
he promi&s;ed to re&s;ign all Brittany to Geoffrey; and if
the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions were not deemed &s;uffcient, he agreed
to add to them whatever the Pope's legates, who were
pre&s;ent, &s;hould require of him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 536. Brompton, p. 1088.</NOTE>. The earl of Leice&s;|ter
was admitted to this negotiation; and either from
the impetuo&s;ity of his temper, or from a view of break|ing
<PB N="473" REF="513">
off abruptly a conference, which mu&s;t cover the al|lies
with confu&s;ion, he gave vent to the mo&s;t violent re|proaches
again&s;t Henry, and even put his hand to his
&s;word, as if he meant to attempt &s;ome violence upon
him. This furious action threw the whole company
into confu&s;ion, and put an end to the treaty<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 536.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE chief hopes of Henry's enemies &s;eemed now to
depend on the &s;tate of affairs in England, where his au|thority
was expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger. One
article of young Henry's agreement with his foreign
confederates, was, that he &s;hould re&s;ign Kent, with
Dover and all its other fortre&s;&s;es, into the hands of the
count of Flanders<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 533. Brompton, p. 1084. Neubr. p. 508.</NOTE>; yet &s;o little national or public &s;pi|rit
prevailed among the independant Engli&s;h nobility, &s;o
wholly bent were they on the aggrandizement each of
him&s;elf and his own family, that, notwith&s;tanding this
pernicious conce&s;&s;ion, which mu&s;t have produced the
total ruin of the kingdom, the majority of them had
con&s;pired to make an in&s;urrection and to &s;upport the
prince's preten&s;ions. The King's chief re&s;ource lay in
the church and the bi&s;hops, with whom he was now in
perfect agreement; whether that the decency of their
character made them a&s;hamed of &s;upporting &s;o unnatural
a rebellion, or that they were entirely &s;atisfied with
Henry's atonement for the murder of Becket and for his
former inva&s;ion of eccle&s;ia&s;tical immunities. That prince,
however, had re&s;igned none of the e&s;&s;ential rights of
his crown in the accommodation; he maintained &s;till the
&s;ame prudent jealou&s;y of the court of Rome; admitted
no legate into England, without his &s;wearing to attempt
nothing again&s;t his royal prerogatives; and he had even
obliged the monks of Canterbury, who pretended to a
free election on the vacancy, made by the death of
<PB N="474" REF="514">
Becket, to choo&s;e Roger, prior of Dover, in the place
of that turbulent prelate<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 537.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of Scotland now made an irruption into
Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> and committed great devastations; and
being oppo&s;ed by Richard de Lucy, whom Henry had
left guardian of the realm, he retreated into his own
kingdom, and agreed to a ce&s;&s;ation of arms<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 89. Hoveden, p. 536. Diceto, p. 573. Bromp|ton, p. 1089. Neubrig. p. 407.</NOTE>. This
truce enabled the guardian to march &s;outhwards with his
army, in order to oppo&s;e an inva&s;ion, which the earl
of Leice&s;ter, at the head of a great body of Flemings,
had made upon Suffolk. The Flemings had been joined
by Hugh Bigod, who made them ma&s;ters of his ca&s;tle
of Framingham; and marching into the heart of the
kingdom, where they hoped to be &s;upported by Leice&s;|ter's
va&s;&s;als, they were met by Lucy, who, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
Humphrey Bohun, the con&s;table, and the earls of Arun|del,
Gloce&s;ter, and Cornwal, had advanced to Farn|ham
with a le&s;s numerous, but braver army, to oppo&s;e them.
The Flemings, who were mo&s;tly weavers and
other trade&s;men (for manufactures were now beginning
to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Flanders) were broke in an in&s;tant,
ten thou&s;and of them were put to the &s;word, the earl

defend him&s;elf on all quarters, from &s;o many open and

the King of Scotland, on the expiration of the
truce, broke into the northern provinces with a va&s;t ar|my<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heming. p. 501.</NOTE> of 80,000 men; which, tho' undi&s;ciplined and di&s;|orderly,
and better adapted for committing deva&s;tation,
than for executing any military enterprise, was become
dangerous from the pre&s;ent factious and turbulent &s;pirit
of the kingdom. Henry, who had baffled all his ene|mies
in France, and had put his frontiers in a po&s;ture of
defence, now found England the &s;eat of danger; and he
determined by his pre&s;ence to overawe the malcontents,

landed at Southampton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th July.</NOTE> and knowing the influence of

prayer during a whole day, watched all night the holy
reliques; and not &s;atisfied with this hypocritical devo|tion

&s;o long di&s;quieted his government, and had been the ob|ject

But Glanville, informed of his &s;ituation, made a ha&s;ty

the inferior rebels imitating the example, all
England was re&s;tored to tranquillity in a few weeks;
and as the King, appeared to lie under the immediate

Lewis, de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s by open force, tried to gain
the town by a &s;tratagem, which, in that &s;uper&s;titious
age, was deemed very little honourable. He proclaimed
in his own camp a ce&s;&s;ation of arms on pretence of cele|brating

<P>THERE was, however, a nece&s;&s;ity on both &s;ides for an

He &s;tipulated to do homage to Henry, as his liege lord,

The Engli&s;h monarch &s;tretched &s;till farther the

the Kling and &s;tates of Scotland to make a perpetual
ce&s;&s;ion of the fortre&s;&s;es of Berwic and Roxborough, and
to allow the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh to remain in his hands
for a limited time. This was the fir&s;t great a&s;cendant
which England obtained over Scotland; and indeed the
fir&s;t important event, which had pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e
kingdoms. Few princes have been &s;o fortunate as to
gain con&s;iderable advantages over their weaker neigh|bours
with le&s;s violence and inju&s;tice, than was practi&s;ed
by Henry again&s;t the King of Scotland, whom he had
taken pri&s;oner in battle, and who had wantonly engaged
in a war, in which all the neighbours of that prince,
and even all his own family, were, without provoca|tion,
combined again&s;t him.</P>

again&s;t tho&s;e inconveniencies, which either the pa&s;t con|vul&s;ions

obliged to abjure the realm<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 132.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL advances towards rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e are &s;low
and gradual. Henry, tho' &s;en&s;ible of the great ab&s;ur|dity,
attending the trial by duel or battle, did not ven|ture
to aboli&s;h it: He only admitted either of the par|ties
to challenge a trial by an a&s;&s;ize or jury of twelve
freeholders<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Glanv. lib. 2. cap. 7.</NOTE>. This method of trial &s;eems to have been
<PB N="482" REF="522">
very antient in England, and was fixed by the laws of
King Alfred: But the barbarous and violent genius of
the age had of late given more credit to the trial by bat|tle,
which had become the general method of deciding
all important controver&s;ies. It was never aboli&s;hed by
law in England; and there is an in&s;tance of it &s;o late
as the reign of Elizabeth: But the in&s;titution revived
by this King, being found more rea&s;onable and more
&s;uitable to a civilized people, gradually prevailed over
it.</P>
<P>THE partition of England into four divi&s;ions, and
the appointment of itinerant ju&s;tices to go the circuit in
each divi&s;ion, and decide the cau&s;es in the counties, was
another important ordinance of this prince, had a direct
tendency to re&s;train the oppre&s;&s;ions of the barons, and
to protect the inferior gentry and common people in
their property<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 590.</NOTE>. The&s;e ju&s;tices were either prelates or
con&s;iderable nobility; and be&s;ides carrying the authority
of the King's commi&s;&s;ion, were able, by the dignity of
their own character, to give weight and credit to the
laws.</P>
<P>THAT there might be fewer ob&s;tacles to the execu|tion
of ju&s;tice, the King was vigilant in demoli&s;hing all
the new erected ca&s;tles of the nobility, in England as
well as in his foreign dominions; and he permitted no
fortre&s;s to remain in hands, whom he found rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Benedict. Abbas, p. 202. Diceto, p. 585.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT le&s;t the kingdom &s;hould be expo&s;ed by this de|molition
of the &s;trong places, the King fixed an a&s;&s;ize
of arms, by which all his &s;ubjects were obliged to put
them&s;elves in a &s;ituation proper for defending them&s;elves
and the realm. Every man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a knight's fee,
was ordained to have for each fee a coat of mail, a hel|met,
<PB N="483" REF="523">
a &s;hield, and a lance; every free layman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of goods to the value of &s;ixteen marks, was to be arm|ed
in like manner; every one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ten marks was
obliged to have an iron gorget, a cap of iron, and a
lance; all burge&s;&s;es were to have a cap of iron, a lance,
and a wambais, that is, a coat twilted with wools, tow,
or &s;uch other materials<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 305. Chron. Gerv. p. 1459. Annal. Waverl. p. 161.</NOTE>. It appears, that archery, for
which the Engli&s;h were afterwards &s;o renowned, had
not, at this time, become very common among them.
The &s;pear was the chief weapon employed in battle.</P>
<P>THE clergy and the laity were during that age in a
&s;trange &s;ituation with regard to each other, and &s;uch as
may &s;eem totally incompatible with a civilized, and in|deed
with any government. If a clergyman was guilty
of murder he could only be puni&s;hed by degradation:
If he was murdered, the murderer, was only expo&s;ed to
excommunication and eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures; and the
crime was atoned for by penances and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Petri Ble&s;&s;en. epi&s;t. 73. apud Bibl. Patr. tom. 24. p. 9$2.</NOTE>.
Hence the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of Thomas a Becket him&s;elf, tho'
guilty of the mo&s;t atrocious wickedne&s;s, and the mo&s;t
repugnant to the &s;entiments of that age, lived &s;ecurely
in their own hou&s;es, without being called to account by
Henry him&s;elf, who was &s;o much concerned, both in
honour and intere&s;t, to puni&s;h that crime, and who pro|fe&s;&s;ed
or affected on all occa&s;ions the mo&s;t extreme ab|horrence
of it. It was not till they found their pre&s;ence
&s;hunned by every one as excommunicated per&s;ons, that
they were induced to take a journey to Rome, to throw
them&s;elves at the Pope's feet, and to &s;ubmit to the pe|nances
impo&s;ed upon them: After which, they continued
to po&s;&s;e&s;s, without mole&s;tation, their honours and for|tunes,
and &s;eem even to have recovered the countenance
<PB N="484" REF="524">
and good opinion of the public. But as the King, by
the con&s;titutions of Clarendon, which he endeavoured
&s;till to maintain in force<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Gerva&s;e, p. 1433.</NOTE>, had &s;ubjected the clergy to a
trial by the civil magi&s;trate, it &s;eemed but ju&s;t to give
them the protection of that power, to which they were
&s;ubjeced; and it was enacted, that the murderers of
clergymen &s;hould be tried before the ju&s;ticiary in the pre|&s;ence
of the bi&s;hop or his official; and be&s;ides the u&s;ual
puni&s;hment for murder, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to a forfei|ture

and chattles<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 592. Chron. Gerva&s;e, p. 1433.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King pa&s;&s;ed a very equitable law, that the goods
of a va&s;&s;al &s;hall not be &s;eized for the debt of his lord,
unle&s;s the va&s;&s;al be &s;urety for the debt; and that the rents
of va&s;&s;als &s;hall be paid to the creditors of the lord, not
to the lord him&s;elf. It is remarkable, that this law was
enacted by the King in a council which he held at Ver|ne&uuml;il,
and which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome prelates and barons
of England, as well as &s;ome of Normandy, Poictou,
Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Brittany; and the &s;ta|tute
took place in all the&s;e different territories<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bened, Abb. p. 248.

to de$poti&s;m, tho' in others they &s;eemed &s;carce
to po&s;&s;e&s;s any authority. If a prince, much dreaded
and revered like Henry, obtained but the appearance of
general con&s;ent to an ordinance, which was equitable
and ju&s;t, it became immediately an e&s;tabli&s;hed law, and
all the world acquie&s;ced in it. If the prince was hated
or de&s;pi&s;ed; if the nobles, who &s;upported him, had &s;mall
<PB N="485" REF="525">
influence; if the humours of the times di&s;po&s;ed the peo|ple
to que&s;tion the ju&s;tice of his ordinances; the fulle&s;t
and mo&s;t authentic council had no authority. Thus all
was confu&s;ion and di&s;order; no regular ideas of a con|&s;titution
prevailed; force and violence decided every thing.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s which had attended Henry in his wars
did not encourage his neighbours to attempt any thing
again&s;t him; and his tran&s;actions with them, during the
remainder of his reign, contain little memorable. Scot|land
remained in that &s;tate of feudal &s;ubjection, to which
he had reduced it; and gave him no farther inquietude.
He &s;ent over his fourth &s;on, John, into Ireland, with
a view of making a more compleat conque&s;t of that
i&s;land; but the petulance and incapacity of this prince,
by which he enraged the Iri&s;h chieftains, obliged him
&s;oon after to recall him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 437, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The King of France had
fallen into a very abject &s;uper&s;tition; and was induced
by a devotion, more &s;incere than that of Henry, to
make a pilgrimage to the tomb of Becket<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 95. Bened. Abb. p. 318. Hoveden, p. 592. M. We&s;tm. p. 252. Diceto, p. 604.</NOTE>, in order to
obtain his interce&s;&s;ion for the recovery of Philip, his eld|e&s;t &s;on. He probably thought him&s;elf well intitled to
the favour of that &s;aint, on account of their antient in|timacy;
and hoped, that kecket, whom he had pro|tected
while on earth, would not now, that he was &s;o
highly advanced in heaven, forget his old friend and be|nefactor.
The monks, &s;en&s;ible that their &s;aint's honour
was concerned in the ca&s;e, failed not to publi&s;h, that
Lewis's prayers were an&s;wered, and that the young prince

which deprived him of his judgment: Philip, tho' a
youth of fifteen, took on him the admini&s;tration, till
his father's death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1180.</NOTE> which happened &s;oon after, opened
his way to the throne; and he proved the able&s;t and
greate&s;t monarch that had governed that kingdom, &s;ince
the age of Charlemagne. The &s;uperior years, how|ever,
and experience of Henry, while they moderated
his ambition, gave him &s;uch an a&s;cendant over this
prince, that no dangerous rival&s;hip, for a long time,
aro&s;e between them. The Engli&s;h monarch, in&s;tead of
taking advantage of his &s;ituation, rather employed his
good offices to compo&s;e the quarrels which aro&s;e in the
royal family of France; and he was &s;ucce&s;sful in medi|ating
a reconcilement between Philip and his mother and
uncles<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 325. Hoveden, p. 593. Brompton, p. 1142. Chron. Gerva&s;e, p. 1459.</NOTE>. The&s;e &s;ervices were but ill requited by Phi|lip,
who, when he came to man's e&s;tate, fomented all
the dome&s;tic di&s;cords in the royal family of England,
and encouraged Henry's &s;ons in their ungrateful and un|dutiful
behaviour towards him.</P>
<P>YOUNG Henry, equally impatient of obtaining power,
and incapable of u&s;ing it, renewed his demand to the
King, of re&s;igning Normandy; and on meeting with
a refu&s;al, he fled with his &s;pou&s;e to the court of France:
But not finding Philip di&s;po&s;ed to enter into war for his
&s;ake, he accepted of his father's offers of reconcilement,
and made his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. It was a cruel circum&s;tance
in the King's fortune, that he could hope for no tran|quillity
from the criminal enterprises of his &s;ons but by
their mutual di&s;cord and animo&s;ities, which di&s;turbed his
family, and threw his &s;tate into convul&s;ions. Richard,
whom he had made ma&s;ter of Guienne, and who had
di&s;played his valour and military genius, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
the revolts of his mutinous barons, refu&s;ed to obey Hen|ry's
<PB N="487" REF="527">
orders, in doing homage to his elder brother for
that dutchy; and he defended him&s;elf again&s;t young

war into his territories<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ypod Neu&s;t. p. 451. Bened Abb. p. 383. Diceto, p. 617.</NOTE>. The King with &s;ome diffi|culty
compo&s;ed this difference; but immediately found
his elde&s;t &s;on engaged in con&s;piracies, and ready to take

he might at lea&s;t die with the &s;atisfaction of having re|ceived
his forgivene&s;s. Henry, who had &s;o often expe|rienced

As prince Henry had left no po&s;terity, Richard was be|come

that John, his third &s;urviving &s;on and favour|ite,
&s;hould inherit Guienne as his appanage: But Rich|ard
refu&s;ed his con&s;ent, fled into that dutchy, and even
made preparations for carrying on war, as well again&s;t
his father as again&s;t his brother Geoffrey, who was now

his Queen, the heire&s;s of Guienne, and required Rich|ard
to deliver up to her the dominion of the&s;e territo|ries;
which that prince, either dreading an in&s;urrection
of the Ga&s;cons in her favour, or retaining &s;ome &s;en&s;e of
duty towards her, readily performed; and he returned
peaceably to his father's court. No &s;ooner was this
quarrel accommodated, than Geoffrey, the mo&s;t vicious
perhaps of all Henry's unhappy family, broke out into
violence; demanded Anjou to be annexed to his domi|nions
of Brittany; and on meeting with a refu&s;al, fled
to the court of France, and levied armies again&s;t his

Emperor Conrade, and Lewis VII. King of France, in
which there peri&s;hed above 200,000 men, brought them
but a temporary relief; and the&s;e princes, after lo&s;ing
&s;uch immen&s;e armies, and &s;eeing the flower of their no|bility
fall by their &s;ide, returned with little honour into
Europe. But the&s;e repeated misfortunes, which drained
the we&s;tern world of its people and trea&s;ure; were not
yet &s;ufficient to cure men of their pa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e &s;pi|ritual
adventures; and a new incident rekindled with
fre&s;h fury the zeal of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics and military adven|turers
of the Latin Chri&s;tians. Saladin, a prince of
great genero&s;ity, bravery, and conduct, having fixed
him&s;elf on the throne of Egypt, began to extend his
conque&s;ts over all the Ea&s;t; and finding the &s;ettlements
of the Chri&s;tians in Pale&s;tine an invincible ob&s;tacle to
the progre&s;s of his arms, he bent the whole force of his
policy and valour to &s;ubdue that &s;mall and barren, but
important territory. Taking advantage of di&s;&s;entions,
which prevailed among the champions of the Cro&s;s,
and having &s;ecretly gained the count of Tripoli, who
commanded their armies, he invaded the frontiers with
a mighty power; and, aided by the treachery of that
count gained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1187.</NOTE> at Tiberiade a compleat victory over
them, which utterly annihilated the force of the already
langui&s;hing kingdom of Jeru&s;alem. The holy city it&s;elf
fell into his hands after a feeble re&s;i&s;tance; the kingdom
of Antioch was almo&s;t entirely &s;ubdued; and except
&s;ome maritime towns, nothing of importance remained

<P>THE we&s;tern Chri&s;tians were a&s;toni&s;hed on receiving
this di&s;mal intelligence. Pope Urban III. it is pretend|ed,
died of grief; and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Gregory VIII. em|ployed
the whole time of his &s;hort pontificate in rouz|ing
to arms all the Chri&s;tians who acknowledged his
authority. The general cry was, that they were un|worthy
of enjoying any inheritance in heaven, who did
not vindicate from the dominion of the infidels the in|heritance
of God on earth, and deliver from &s;lavery that
country which had been con&s;ecrated by the foot&s;teps of
their Saviour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1188.</NOTE> William, archbi&s;hop of Tyre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21th Jan.</NOTE> having
procured a conference between Henry and Philip near
Gi&s;ors, enforced all the&s;e topics; gave a pathetic de|&s;cription
of the mi&s;erable &s;tate of the ea&s;tern Chri&s;tians;
and employed every topic to excite the ruling pa&s;&s;ions
of the age, &s;uper&s;tition and jealou&s;y of military honour<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 531.</NOTE>.
The two monarchs immediately took the cro&s;s; many
of their mo&s;t con&s;iderable va&s;&s;als imitated the example<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Neubrig. p. 435. Heming. p. 512.</NOTE>;
and as the Emperor Frederic I. entered into the &s;ame
confederacy, &s;ome well grounded hopes of &s;ucce&s;s were
entertained; and men flattered them&s;elves, that an en|terprize,
which had failed under the conduct of many
independant chieftains, or of weak princes, might at
la&s;t, by the efforts of &s;uch potent and able monarchs, be
brought to a happy i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>THE Kings of France and England impo&s;ed a tax,
amounting to the tenth of all moveable goods, on &s;uch
as remained at home<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 498.</NOTE>; but as they exempted from this
burden mo&s;t of the regular clergy, the &s;ecular a&s;pired to
the &s;ame privilege; pretended that it was only their
<PB N="491" REF="531">
duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t the cru&s;ade with their prayers; and it was
with &s;ome difficulty they were obliged to de&s;i&s;t from an
oppo&s;ition, which in them, who had been the chief in|&s;tigators
to the&s;e pious enterprizes, appeared with the
wor&s;t grace imaginable<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Petri Ble&s;&s;en. epi&s;t. 112.</NOTE>. This backwardne&s;s of the
clergy is perhaps a &s;ymptom, that the enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardour,
which had at fir&s;t &s;eized the people for cru&s;ades, was
now con&s;iderably abated by time and ill &s;ucce&s;s; and that
the frenzy was chiefly &s;upported by the military genius
and love of glory in the great monarchs.</P>
<P>BUT before this great machine could be put in motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1189.</NOTE>
there were &s;till many ob&s;tacles to &s;urmount. Philip,
jealous of Henry's greatne&s;s, entered into a private con|federacy
with young Richard, and working on his am|bitious
and impatient temper, per&s;uaded him, in&s;tead of
&s;upporting and aggrandizing that monarchy, which he was
one day to inherit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of prince Richard.</NOTE> to &s;eek pre&s;ent power and indepen|dance,
by di&s;turbing and di&s;membering it. In order to
give a pretence for ho&s;tilities between the two Kings,
Richard broke into the territories of Raymond, count of
Tholou&s;e, who immediately carried his complaints of
this violence before the King of France as his &s;uperior
lord. Philip remon&s;trated with Henry; but received for
an&s;wer, that Richard had confe&s;&s;ed to the archbi&s;hop of
Dublin, that his enterprize again&s;t Raymond had been
undertaken by the approbation of Philip him&s;elf, and
was conducted by his authority. The King of France,
who might have been covered with &s;hame and confu&s;ion
by this detection, &s;till pro&s;ecuted his de&s;ign, and broke
into the provinces of Berri and Auvergne, under colour
of revenging the quarrel of the count of Tholou&s;e<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 508.</NOTE>.
Henry retaliated by making inroads upon the frontiers of
France, and burning Dreux. As this war, which
<PB N="492" REF="532">
de&s;troyed all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in the projected cru&s;ade,
gave great &s;candal, the two Kings held a conference at
the accu&s;tomed place between Gi&s;ors and Trie, in order
to find means of accommodating their differences: They
&s;eparated on wor&s;e terms than before; and Philip, to
&s;how his di&s;gu&s;t, ordered a great elm, under which the
conferences had been u&s;ually held, to be cut down<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 517. 532.</NOTE>;
as if he had renounced all de&s;ire of accommodation, and
was determined to carry the war to extremity again&s;t
the King of England. But his own va&s;&s;als refu&s;ed to
&s;erve under him in &s;o invidious a cau&s;e<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 519.</NOTE>; and he was
obliged to come anew to a conference with Henry, and
to offer terms of peace. The&s;e terms were &s;uch as en|tirely
opened the eyes of the King of England, and fully
proved to him the perfidy of his &s;on, and his &s;ecret al|liance
with Philip, of which he had before only enter|tained
&s;ome &s;u&s;picions. The King of France required,
that Richard &s;hould be crowned King of England in the
lifetime of his father, &s;hould be inve&s;ted in all his tran&s;|marine
dominions, and &s;hould be immediately married to
Alice, Philip's &s;i&s;ter, to whom he had formerly been con|tracted,
and who had been already conducted into England<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 521. Hoveden, p. 652.</NOTE>.
Henry had experienced &s;uch fatal effects, both from the
crowning his elde&s;t &s;on, and from that prince's alliance
with the royal family of France, that he rejected the&s;e
terms; and Richard, in con&s;equence of his &s;ecret agree|ment
with Philip, immediately revolted from him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Brompton, p. 1149. Neubrig. p. 437.</NOTE>, did
homage to the King of France for all the dominions
which Henry held of that crown, and received the in|ve&s;titures,
as if he had already been the lawful pro|prietor.
Some hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ert, that Henry him&s;elf had
become enamoured of young Alice, and a&s;&s;ign this as an
<PB N="493" REF="533">
additional rea&s;on for his refu&s;ing the&s;e conditions: But
he had &s;o many other ju&s;t and equitable motives for his
conduct, that it is needle&s;s to &s;eek for a cau&s;e, which
the great prudence and advanced age of that monarch
render &s;omewhat improbable.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Albano, the Pope's legate, di&s;plea&s;ed with
the&s;e increa&s;ing ob&s;tacles to the cru&s;ade, excommuni|cated
Richard, as the chief &s;pring of di&s;cord: But the
&s;entence of excommunication, which, when it was pro|perly
prepared, and was zealou&s;ly &s;upported by the clergy,
had often great influence in that age, proved entirely
ineffectual in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. The chief barons of
Poictou, Guienne, Normandy, and Anjou, being at|tached
to the young prince, and &s;eeing that he had now
received the inve&s;titure from their &s;uperior lord, declared
for him, and made inroads into the territories of &s;uch
as &s;till adhered to the old King. Henry, di&s;quieted by
the daily revolts of his mutinous &s;ubjects, and dreading
&s;till wor&s;e effects from their turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, had
again recour&s;e to papal authority; and engaged the car|dinal
Anagni, who had &s;ucceeded Albano in the legate|&s;hip,
to threaten Philip with laying an interdict on all his
dominions. But Philip, who was a prince of great
vigour and capacity, de&s;pi&s;ed the menace; and told
Anagni, that it belonged not to the Pope to interpo&s;e in
the temporal di&s;putes of princes, much le&s;s in tho&s;e be|tween
him and his rebellious va&s;&s;als. He even proceeded
&s;o far as to reproach the cardinal with partiality, and with
receiving bribes from the King of England<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 104. Bened. Abb. p. 542. Hoveden, p. 652.</NOTE>; while
Richard, &s;till more outrageous, offered to draw his &s;word
upon the legate, and was only hindered by the interpo&s;i|tion
of the company, from committing violence upon
him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 104.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="534">
THE King of England was now obliged to defend
his dominions by arms, and to enter on a war with
France and with his elde&s;t &s;on, a prince of great valour,
on &s;uch di&s;advantageous terms. Fert&eacute;-Barnard fell fir&s;t
into the hands of the enemy: Mans was next taken by
a&s;&s;ault; and Henry, who had thrown him&s;elf into that
place, e&s;caped with &s;ome difficulty<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 105. Bened. Abb. p. 543. Hoveden, p. 653.</NOTE>: Amboi&s;e, Chau|mont,
and Chateau de Loire, opened their gates on the
appearance of Philip and Richard: Tours was inve&s;ted;
and the King, who had retired to Saumur, and had daily
in&s;tances of the cowardice or infidelity of his governors,
expected the mo&s;t di&s;mal i&s;&s;ue to all his enterprizes.
While he was in this &s;tate of de&s;pondency, the duke of
Burgundy, the count of Flanders, and the archbi&s;hop
of Rheims interpo&s;ed with their good offices; and the
intelligence, which he received of the taking Tours, and
which made him fully &s;en&s;ible of the de&s;perate &s;ituation
of his affairs, &s;o &s;ubdued his &s;pirit, that he &s;ubmitted to
all the rigorous terms, which were impo&s;ed upon him.
He agreed, that Richard &s;hould marry the prince&s;s
Alice; that that prince &s;hould receive the homage and
oath of fealty of all his &s;ubjects both in England and
his tran&s;marine dominions; that he him&s;elf &s;hould pay
twenty thou&s;and marks to the King of France as a com|pen&s;ation
for the charges of the war; that his own ba|rons
&s;hould engage to make him ob&s;erve this treaty by
force, and in ca&s;e of his violating it, &s;hould promi&s;e
to join Philip and Richard again&s;t him; and that all
his va&s;&s;als, who had entered into confederacy with
Richard, &s;hould receive an indemnity for this offence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 106. Bened. Abb. p. 545. Hoveden, p. 653.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the mortification, which Henry, who had been
accu&s;tomed to give the law in mo&s;t treaties, received
<PB N="495" REF="535">
from the&s;e di&s;advantageous and humiliating terms, was
the lea&s;t which he met with on this occa&s;ion. When he
demanded a li&s;t of tho&s;e barons, to whom he was to grant
a pardon for their connexions with Richard; he was
a&s;toni&s;hed to find, at the head of them, the name of his
&s;econd &s;on, John<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 654.</NOTE>; who had always been his favourite,
who&s;e intere&s;ts he had ever anxiou&s;ly at heart, and who
had even, on account of his a&s;cendant over him, often
excited the jealou&s;y of Richard<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 541.</NOTE>. This unhappy father,
already overloaded with cares and &s;orrows, finding this
la&s;t di&s;appointment in his dome&s;tic tenderne&s;s, broke out
into expre&s;&s;ions of the utmo&s;t de&s;pair, cur&s;ed the day in,
which he received his mi&s;erable being, and be&s;towed, on
his ungrateful and undutiful children, a malediction,
which he never could be prevailed on to retract<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hoveden, p. 654.</NOTE>. The
more his heart was di&s;po&s;ed to friend&s;hip and affection,
the more he re&s;ented the barbarous return, which his
four &s;ons had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively made to his parental care; and
this fini&s;hing blow, by depriving him of every comfort
in life, quite broke his &s;pirits, and threw him into a lin|gering
fever, of which he &s;oon after expired, at the
ca&s;tle of Chinon near Saumur.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th July.</NOTE> His natural &s;on, Geof|frey,

who came to vi&s;it the dead body of his father, and who,
notwith&s;tanding his criminal conduct, was not altoge|ther
devoid of genero&s;ity, was &s;truck with horror and

behaviour, which had brought his parent to an
untimely grave<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac|ter of Henry.</NOTE> in the fifty-eighth year of his age and
thirty-fifth of his reign, the greate&s;t prince of his time
for wi&s;dom, virtue and ability, and the mo&s;t powerful in extent of dominion of all tho&s;e that had ever filled the
throne of England. His character, both in public and
private life, is almo&s;t without a blemi&s;h; and he &s;eems
to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every accompli&s;hment both of body
and mind, which makes a man either e&s;timable or amiable.
He was of a middle &s;tature, &s;trong and well propor|tioned;
his countenance was lively and engaging; his
conver&s;ation affable and entertaining; his elocution ea&s;y,
per&s;ua&s;ive, and ever at command. He loved peace, but
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both bravery and conduct in war; was provident
without timidity; &s;evere in the execution of ju&s;tice,
without rigour; and temperate without au&s;terity. He
preserved health, and kept him&s;elf from corpulency, to
which he was &s;omewhat inclined, by an ab&s;temious diet,
and by frequent exerci&s;e, particularly hunting. When
he could enjoy lei&s;ure, he recreated him&s;elf either
in learned conver&s;ation or in reading; and he cultivated his
natural talents by &s;tudy, above any prince of his time.
His affections, as well as his enmities, were warm and
durable; and his long experience of the ingratitude and
infidelity of men never de&s;troyed the natural &s;en&s;ibility of
his temper, which di&s;po&s;ed him to friend&s;hip and &s;ociety.
His character has been tran&s;mitted to us by many writers,
who were his contemporaries<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Petri Ble&s;. epi&s;t. 46, 47. in Bibliothieca&punc; Patrum, vol. xxiv. p. 985, 986, &amp;c. Girald. Cam$&punc; p. 783, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and it re&s;embles ex|tremely,
in its mo&s;t remarkable &s;trokes, that of his ma|ternal
grandfather Henry I&punc;: Excepting only that ambi|tion,
<PB N="497" REF="537">
which was a ruling pa&s;&s;ion in both, found not in
the fir&s;t Henry &s;uch unexceptionable means of exerting
it&s;elf, and pu&s;hed that prince into mea&s;ures, which were
both criminal in them&s;elves, and were the cau&s;e of far|ther
crimes, from which his grand&s;on's conduct was
happily exempted.</P>
<P>THIS prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellane|ous tran&s;|actions of this reign.</NOTE> like mo&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors of the
Norman line, except Stephen, pa&s;&s;ed more of his time
on the continent than in this i&s;land: He was &s;urrounded
with the Engli&s;h gentry and nobility, when abroad: The
French gentry and nobility followed him when he re&s;ided
in England: Both nations acted in the government, as
if they were the &s;ame people; and on many occa&s;ions,
the legi&s;latures &s;eem not to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed. As
the King and Engli&s;h barons were all of them of French
extraction, the manners of that people acquired the a&s;|cendant,
and were regarded as the great models of imita|tion.
Ali foreign improvements, therefore, &s;uch as they
were, in literature and politene&s;s, in laws and arts,
&s;eem now to have been, in a good mea&s;ure, tran&s;planted
into England; and that nation was become nowi&s;e infe|rior,
in all the fa&s;hionable accompli&s;hments, to any of its
neighbours on the continent. The more homely, but
more &s;en&s;ible manners and principles of the Saxons, were
exchanged for the affectations of chivalry, and the &s;ub|tilties
of &s;chool philo&s;ophy: The feudal ideas of civil
government, the Romi&s;h &s;entiments of religion, had
taken entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the people: By the former, the
&s;en&s;e of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion towards princes was &s;omewhat dimi|ni&s;hed
in the barons; by the latter, the devoted attach|ment
to papal authority was much augmented among the
clergy. The Norman and other foreign families, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in England, had now &s;truck deep root; and being
entirely coalited with the people, whom at fir&s;t they
oppre&s;&s;ed and de&s;pi&s;ed, they no longer thought that they
<PB N="498" REF="538">
needed the protection of the crown for the enjoyment of
their fortunes, or con&s;idered their tenure as precarious
and dependant. They a&s;pired to the &s;ame liberty and
independance, which they &s;aw enjoyed by their brethren
on the continent, and de&s;ired to re&s;train tho&s;e exorbitant
prerogatives and arbitrary practices, which the nece&s;&s;i|ties
of war and the violence of conque&s;t had at fir&s;t
obliged them to indulge in their monarch. That memory
al&s;o of a more equal government under the Saxon prin|ces,
which &s;till remained with the Engli&s;h, diffu&s;ed &s;till
farther the &s;pirit of liberty, and made the barons both
de&s;irous of more independance to them&s;elves, and willing
to indulge it to the people. And it was not long before
this &s;ecret revolution in the &s;entiments of men produced
fir&s;t violent convul&s;ions in the &s;tate, and then an evident
alteration in the maxims of government.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of all the preceding Kings of England
&s;ince the conque&s;t, give evident proofs of the di&s;orders
attending $he feudal government; the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of
the barons, their &s;pirit of rebellion again&s;t the prince
and laws, and of animo&s;ity again&s;t each other: The
conduct of the barons in the tran&s;marine dominions of
tho&s;e monarchs afforded perhaps &s;till more flagrant in|&s;tances of the&s;e convul&s;ions; and the hi&s;tory of France,
during &s;everal ages, con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t entirely of narrations
of this nature. The cities, during the continuance of
this violent government, could neither be very populous
nor numerous; and there occur in&s;tances, which &s;eem
to prove, that, tho' the&s;e are always the fir&s;t &s;eat of law
and liberty, their police was in general very loo&s;e and
irregular, and expo&s;ed to the &s;ame di&s;orders, with tho&s;e
by which the country was generally infe&s;ted. It was a
cu&s;tom in London for great numbers, to the amount of
a hundred or more, of the &s;ons and relations of eminent
citizens, to form them&s;elves into a licentious, confederacy,
<PB N="499" REF="539">
to break into rich hou&s;es and plunder them, to rob and
murder the pa&s;&s;engers, and to commit with impunity all
&s;orts of di&s;order. By the&s;e crimes, it had become &s;o
dangerous to walk the &s;treets a-nights, that the citizens
dared no more to venture abroad after &s;un-&s;et, than if
they were expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of a public enemy.
The brother of the earl of Ferrars had been murdered
by &s;ome of the&s;e nocturnal rioters; and the death of a
per&s;on of that noble birth, which was much more re|garded
than that of many thou&s;ands of an inferior &s;ta|tion,
&s;o provoked the King, that he &s;wore vengeance
again&s;t the criminals, and became thenceforth much
more rigorous in the execution of the laws<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 196.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another in&s;tance given by hi&s;torians, which
proves to what a height &s;uch riots had proceeded, and
how open the&s;e criminals were in committing their rob|beries.
A band of them had attacked the hou&s;e of a
rich citizen, with an intention of plundering it; had
broke thro' a &s;tone wall with hammers and wedges;
and had already entered the hou&s;e &s;word in hand; when
the citizen, armed cap-a-pee and &s;upported by his faith|ful
&s;ervants, appeare$ in the pa&s;&s;age to oppo&s;e them: He
cut off the right-hand of the fir&s;t robber that entered;
and made &s;uch &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, that his neighbours had
lei&s;ure to a&s;&s;emble, and come to his relief. The man,
who lo&s;t his hand, was caught; and was tempted by the
promi&s;e of pardon to reveal his confederates; among
whom was one John Senex, e&s;teemed among the riche&s;t
and be&s;t born citizens of London. He was convicted
by the ordeal trial; and tho' he offered five hundred
marks for his life, the King refu&s;ed the money, and
ordered him to be hanged<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 197, 198.</NOTE>.</P>

princes made him an arbiter, and &s;ubmitted their differen|ces
to his judgment. Sanchez, King of Navarre, hav|ing
&s;ome controver&s;ies with Alfon&s;o, King of Ca&s;tile,
was contented, tho' Alfon&s;o had married the daughter
of Henry, to choo&s;e that prince for a referee; and they
agreed, each of them, to con&s;ign three ca&s;tles into neu|tral
hands, as a pledge of their not departing from his
award. Henry made the cau&s;e be examined before his
great council, and gave a &s;entence, which was willingly
&s;ubmitted to by both parties. The&s;e two Spani&s;h Kings
&s;ent each a &s;tout champion to the court of England, in
order to defend his cau&s;e by arms, in ca&s;e the way of
duel had been cho&s;en by Henry<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. iv. p. 43. Bened. Abb. p. 172. Diceto, p. 597. Brompton, p. 1120.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY &s;o far aboli&s;hed the barbarous and ab&s;urd
practice of forfeiting &s;hips, which had been wrecked
on the coa&s;t, that if one man or animal was alive in the
&s;hip, the ve&s;&s;el and goods were re&s;tored to the owners<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. i. p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE reign of Henry was remarkable for an innova|tion,
which was afterwards carried farther by his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors,
and was attended with the mo&s;t important con&s;e|quences
to the government. This prince was di&s;gu&s;ted
with the &s;pecies of military force, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed
by the feudal institutions, and which, tho' it was ex|tremely
burden&s;ome to the &s;ubject, yet rendered very
little &s;ervice to the &s;overeign. The barons, or military tenants,
came late into the field; they were obliged
to &s;erve only for forty days; they were un&s;kilful and
di&s;orderly in all their operations; and they were apt to
carry into the camp the &s;ame refractory and independent
&s;pirit, to which they were accu&s;tomed in their civil go|vernment.
Henry, therefore, introduced the practice of
<PB N="501" REF="542">
making a commutation of their military &s;ervice for mo|ney;
and he levied &s;cutages from his baronies and knights
fees, in&s;tead of requiring the per&s;onal attendance of his
va&s;&s;als. There is mention made, in the hi&s;tory of the ex|chequer,
of the&s;e &s;cutages in his &s;econd, fifth, and eighteenth
year<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Madox, p. 435, 436, 437, 438.</NOTE>; and other writers give us an account of three more
of them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. ii. p. 466. from the records.</NOTE>. When the prince had thus obtained money,
he made a contract with &s;ome of tho&s;e adventurers, in
which Europe at that time abounded: They found him
&s;oldiers of the &s;ame character with them&s;elves, who were
bound to &s;erve for a &s;tipulated time: The armies were
much le&s;s numerous, but more u&s;eful, than when com|po&s;ed
of all the military va&s;&s;als of the crown: The feu|dal
in&s;titutions began to relax: The Kings became rapa|cious
for money, on which all their power depended:
The barons, &s;eeing no end of exactions, &s;ought to defend
their property: And as the &s;ame cau&s;es had nearly the
&s;ame effect, in the different countries of Europe, the &s;e|veral
crowns either lo&s;t or acquired authority, according
to their different &s;ucce&s;s in this &s;truggle.</P>
<P>THIS prince was al&s;o the fir&s;t who levied a tax on
the moveables or per&s;onal e&s;tates of his &s;ubjects, nobles
as well as people. Their zeal for the holy wars made
them &s;ubmit to this innovation; and a precedent being
once obtained, this taxation became, in following reigns,
the u&s;ual method of &s;upplying the nece&s;&s;ities of the crown.
The tax of Danegelt, &s;o generally odious to the nation,
was remitted in this reign.</P>
<P>IT was an u&s;ual practice of the Kings of England,
to repeat the ceremony of their coronation thrice a-year,
on a&s;&s;embling the &s;tates at the three great fe&s;tivals&punc;
Henry, after the fir&s;t years of his reign, never renewed
this ceremony, which was found to be very expen&s;ive

and very u&s;ele&s;s. None of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors ever revived it.
It is deemed a great act of grace in this prince, that he
mitigated the rigour of the fore&s;t laws, and puni&s;hed any
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of them, not capitally, but by fines, im|pri&s;onments,
and other more moderate penalties.</P>
<P>SINCE we are here collecting &s;ome detached in&s;tances,
which &s;how the genius of the age, and which could
not &s;o well enter into the body of the hi&s;tory, it may not
be ami&s;s to mention the quarrel between Roger archbi&s;hop
of York, and Richard archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. We
may judge of the violence of military men and laymen,
when eccle&s;ia&s;tics could proceed to &s;uch extremities.
Cardinal Haguezun being &s;ent, in 1176, as legate into
Britain, &s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly of the clergy at London;
and as both the archbi&s;hops pretended to &s;it on his right
hand, this que&s;tion of precedency begot a controver&s;y
between them. The monks and retainers of archbi&s;hop
Richard fell upon Roger, in the pre&s;ence of the cardinal
and of the &s;ynod, threw him on the ground, trampled
him under foot, and &s;o brui&s;ed him with blows, that he
was taken up half dead, and his life was, with difficulty,
&s;aved from their violence. The archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury
was obliged to give a large &s;um of money to the
legate, in order to &s;uppre&s;s all complaints of this enor|mity<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Bened. Abb. p. 138, 139. Brompton, p. 1109. Chron. Gerv. p. 1433. Neub$ig. p. 413.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS King left only two legitimate &s;ons, Richard,
who &s;ucceeded him, and John, who inherited no terri|tory,
tho' his father had often intended to leave him a
part of his exten&s;ive dominions. He was thence com|monly
denominated <HI>Lackland.</HI> Henry left three legitimate
daughters; Maud, born in 1156, and married to Henry,
duke of Saxony; Eleanor, born in 1162, and married
<PB N="503" REF="545">
to Alphon&s;o, King of Ca&s;tile; Joan, born in 1165,
and married to William, King of Sicily<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Diceto, p. 616.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY is &s;aid by antient hi&s;torians to have been of a
very amorous di&s;po&s;ition; and they mention two of his
natural &s;ons by Ro&s;amond, daughter of lord Clifford,
viz. Richard Longe&s;p&eacute;e, or Long&s;word, (&s;o called from
the &s;word he u&s;ually wore) who was afterwards married
to Ela, the daughter and heire&s;s of the earl of Sali&s;bury;
and Geoffrey, fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Lincoln, and then archbi&s;hop
of York. All the other circum&s;tances of the &s;tory com|monly
told of that lady &s;eem to be fabulous.</P>
