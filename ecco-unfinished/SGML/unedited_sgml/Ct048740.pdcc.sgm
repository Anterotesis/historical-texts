<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_POEMS of this Nature are gene|rally interpreted as the Re&s;ult of Malice or Di&s;appointment, and the candid Reader is too apt to conclude again&s;t the <HI>Satyri&s;t,</HI> as a Peevi&s;h, Ill-natur'd Man, or a De&s;perate, Un&s;ucce&s;sful Lover: However liable I may be to the <HI>former</HI> of the&s;e Imputations, I e&s;teem my &s;elf &s;afe enough again&s;t the <HI>latter,</HI> from any Per&s;on who has the lea&s;t Knowledge of the Ladies, with whom I have to deal in the following Papers; for, alas! Cro&s;&s;es and Di&s;appoinments in Love, are Things almo&s;t unknown to our Univer&s;ity-Gal|lants; it is next to impo&s;&s;ible for any Thing in
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
a <HI>Cap</HI> and a <HI>Gown,</HI> that has the Appearance of a Man, a little Money, and a tolerable A&s;|&s;urance, to fail in his Addre&s;&s;es; they &s;trike into any Mea&s;ures and catch at the fir&s;t Overtures of Love before Rea&s;on and Reflection &s;tep in and cool the Heat and Vehemence of a wanton Pa&s;|&s;ion: In &s;hort, the Man that dies for Love, at <HI>Oxford,</HI> is, in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, guilty of <HI>Self-Murther,</HI> and ought to be treated as &s;uch, with all the Ignominous Severity of the Law.</P>
<P>And if a &s;incere Abhorrence of Pride, Lu&s;t, Vanity and Impudence, mu&s;t be called Malice and Ill-Nature, it is, however, &s;ome Comfort to me, to reflect that I am not the only Per|&s;on to bear the Load; as I am not the only One that has taken Notice of the almo&s;t univer&s;al Cor|ruption of our Youth, which is to he imputed to nothing &s;o much as to that Multitude of Female <HI>Re&s;identiaries,</HI> who have of late infe&s;ted our Learned Retirements, and drawn off Num|bers of unwary young Per&s;ons from their Studies. They have been indeed very &s;ucce&s;s|ful in their Labours of Reformation, for (as the Ingenious Author of a Letter upon this Subject, publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Freethinker,</HI> rightly
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
ob&s;erves) there appears to be a prevailing An|tipathy to every thing that is &s;erious and laud|able, and to even the Name and Character of <HI>Scholars;</HI> they look upon <HI>Scholar,</HI> as an unpolite pedantick Word, incompatible with the more plea&s;ing Names of <HI>clever Fellows,</HI> and <HI>fine Gentlemen:</HI> The Face of Learning is almo&s;t quite worn off, and it is become highly &s;candalous to carry the lea&s;t Mark of a Philo|&s;opher about us; a grave Countenance and a &s;ober Habit, are treated as the Object of Ridicule, and the Per&s;on who appears not to have made the Fa&s;hions and the <HI>Beau-Monde</HI> the greate&s;t Part of his Studies, is &s;ure to be laugh'd at for a dull, heavy, plodding Wretch, a mere Clown, or a Pedant: There appears on the Foreheads of the greate&s;t Part of our Stu|dents an unthoughtful Openne&s;s and Levity; and in their Dre&s;s an unbecoming Shewine&s;s and Af|fectation; <HI>Silk-Gowns, Tye-Wiggs,</HI> and <HI>Ruffles,</HI> are become nece&s;&s;ary Accompli&s;hments for a Man of Sen&s;e, and our <HI>Colleges,</HI> in&s;tead of grave Philo&s;ophers and <HI>Literati,</HI> &s;warm with <HI>Smarts</HI> and Foplings, that is, Con&s;ummate Coxcombs.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6">A College-<HI>SMART,</HI> is a Character, which few perhaps are acquainted with; He is one that &s;pends his Time in a con&s;tant Circle of En|gagements and A&s;&s;ignations; He ri&s;es at Ten, tattles over his Tea-Table till Twelve, Dines, Dre&s;&s;es; waits upon his Mi&s;tre&s;s, drinks Tea again, flutters about in Publick 'till it is dark, then to the Tavern, knocks into College at Two in the Morning, &s;leeps 'till Ten again, and di&s;|po&s;es of the following Day, ju&s;t as he did of the la&s;t: He affects great Company, and &s;crapes Ac|quaintance with <HI>golden Tufts</HI> and <HI>brocaded Gowns;</HI> and after a cour&s;e of Studies of this Nature for three or four Years, he hud|dles over publick Exerci&s;es, di&s;putes and pa&s;|&s;es Examination in the Sciences after the mo|dern Fa&s;hion, without under&s;tanding a word of what, like a Parrot, he is taught memorially to utter: He then canva&s;&s;es and obtains his <HI>Grace</HI> among&s;t the Ladies, and takes his De|gree with uncommon Marks of Honour; and thus pa&s;&s;es for a mo&s;t profound Scholar, meer|ly by being an arrant Blockhead. This Cla&s;s of Men is very numerous among&s;t us, and dai|ly encrea&s;es without Controul, to the great
<PB N="v" REF="7">
Scandal and Di&s;credit of all u&s;eful Learning, and is an Enormity of very bad Con&s;equence, as it may in Time &s;ap the Foundation of the mo&s;t famous and flouri&s;hing Univer&s;ity in the World.</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;chief does not &s;top here; for alas! We have too many In&s;tances of unfortunate Gentlemen, who not only neglect their Studies, and fru&s;trate the prudent Purpo&s;es of their indul|gent Parents, but who, Step by Step, are often pre|vail'd upon to throw off all &s;en&s;e of Duty and Intere&s;t, to involve them&s;elves into inextricable Ruin, and their Friends into the bittere&s;t Sor|rows, by marrying &s;ome tit Thing or other of mean Parentage, and &s;u&s;pected Morals: And this is indeed a Thing &s;o very practicable upon young Men of raw Judgment and warm Inclinations, and there are &s;o many of the&s;e <HI>Kidnapping Females</HI> &s;till upon the Watch, and <HI>&s;eeking whom they may devour,</HI> that it is enough to di&s;courage a fond Parent or a careful Guar|dian, from &s;ending his Son or his Ward to a Place which abounds with &s;o many Deceivers, (who take all po&s;&s;ible Opportunities of &s;erving their pernicious De&s;igns) and where they mu&s;t be
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
a&s;&s;aulted by &s;o many bewitching Temptations. Our <HI>OXFORD FORTUNES</HI> are ju&s;tly bran|ded for a Proverb all over the Nation, for they really ri&s;e out of the lowe&s;t Dregs of Mankind; The Daughters of our <HI>Coblers, Tinkers, Taylors,</HI> and of the mo&s;t &s;coundrel Profe&s;&s;ions &s;et out with a Dancing-School Education, and trap them&s;elves out in all the out&s;ide Gayity they can afford; &s;o that they are to be known from true Gentlewomen, only by their unconquerable Pride and awkard In&s;olence. It is at <HI>Oxford</HI> no Rarity to &s;ee a poor Man work hard for a Twelve-Month, to make his Girl look fine on a Sunday, and almo&s;t &s;tarve his Family at Home in order to gratifie his Vanity and Ambition A|broad. I would not willingly from hence be thought to in&s;ult my Inferiors, nor to treat any Fellow-Creature opprobriou&s;ly, becau&s;e Fortune has placed him in a lower Scene of Life than my &s;elf, &s;ince my De&s;ign is only to let them know that they are not to look above them&s;elves, but to be contented with their own humble Condition, and not by infamous Methods endeavour to rai&s;e them&s;elves by ruining of others; and to warn my Fellow-Students to &s;hun all Commerce with &s;uch a&s;piring <HI>Beggars,</HI> to &s;hut their Eyes to
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
their Beauty, and their Ears to their Inchant|ments; to pur&s;ue their Studies with unwearied Application, to make the be&s;t u&s;e of the Talents and Opportunities which are intru&s;ted to them, to do every Thing in its proper Sea&s;on, and not leave the &s;ublime and u&s;eful Le&s;&s;ons of Phi|lo&s;ophy, for the prettie&s;t <HI>Whore</HI> in Chri&s;ten|dom.</P>
<P>I have one Thing more to mention before I conclude. I hope Mrs. <HI>T-rr-l</HI> will now be con|vinc'd, that there is in the Univer&s;ity one who, if he has not <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> enough, has at lea&s;t <HI>Cou|rage</HI> enough to attack the <HI>Oxford Beauties</HI> in a Satire, and I would therefore advi&s;e her for the future to be more mode&s;t, and not &s;et &s;o great a Value upon her &s;elf and her Friends, as to think their Per&s;ons &s;acred and inviolable. They are not always to be <HI>Phylli&s;ed</HI> up in ful&s;om Panegyrick, and it would better become them not to grow &s;o in&s;olent when they are, for fear &s;ome bold, impudent Fellow like my &s;elf, &s;hould ri&s;e up and dive&s;t them of their borrowed Excellencies and &s;hew them naked in their own proper Deformi|ties: Their Champion has made <HI>Nymphs, An|gels</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
and <HI>Godde&s;&s;es</HI> of 'em all; I have &s;hew|ed them in a quite different Light, and which of us has drawn the Picture mo&s;t like the Original, I am willing to leave the impartial World to determine.</P>
