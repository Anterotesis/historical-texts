<HEAD><HI>UNION</HI> AND No UNION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> are united by an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Con&s;titution, and formed both into One Body, now called the Kingdom of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> which Con&s;titution is called the UNION; this is well enough known. But that there is Union little enough a|mong us, as well about the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of that Con&s;titution it &s;elf, as a|bout the Ob&s;erving or not Ob&s;erving the Articles made between us, is the

great Misfortune of Both Nations. I believe I may &s;ay without giving any one offence, that a Firmer Union of Policy with Le&s;s Union of Affection, has hardly been known in the whole World. Nay it will not, I believe, be offer'd or &s;ugge&s;ted, that there is any Vi&s;ible Increa&s;e of Good Will, Chari|ty, or Love of Neighbourhood, be|tween the Nations, &s;ince the fini&s;hing the Tran&s;action of the late Treaty of Union. I am very &s;orry to note a Truth &s;o little to our Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>It would be too Inviduous a Task to enter into a Particular Account of the Rea&s;ons which might be given for the&s;e Divi&s;ions, and this Decay of Affection between the Two Nations, &s;ince the late <HI>&V;nion;</HI> mo&s;t of them may be re|duc'd to the&s;e three.</P>

<L>Matters of Religion; between <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and Epi&s;copal.</L>

<L>Matters of Property; about Taxing and not Taxing, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>Of all the&s;e it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome Account, that indifferent People
<PB N="5" REF="5">
may judge whether the&s;e Breaches are &s;ufficiently grounded, whether there are any probable Methods to be propo|&s;ed for a Cure, and how far the <HI>&V;nion</HI> may or may not be &s;aid to be broken and di&s;&s;olved thereby: From the Re&s;ult of which al&s;o, the Conduct of &s;ome Gentlemen in their late Publick Re&s;ent|ment of things relating to <HI>Seotland,</HI> may be approv'd or condemn'd.</P>
<P>FIRST. <HI>Matters of Religion; between</HI> Presbyterian <HI>and Epi&s;copal.</HI> The Breach here &s;eems to lye thus; The <HI>Presbyteri|ans</HI> having capitulated in the Treaty of Union for the Security of their Church, and for the pre&s;erving all its Pri|vileges; both as to Di&s;cipline and Government, and the Uniformity al&s;o as to Doctrine and Wor&s;hip; expected perhaps from thence that no Encourage|ment, Countenance, or Protection, much le&s;s Toleration, &s;hould be given to the Epi&s;copal, (called there) the Prelatic Party; and therefore the&s;e, when the Act for tollerating the Epi&s;copal Meetings was pa&s;s'd; an Act for re&s;toring the <HI>Yule</HI> Vacance; and another to re&s;tore the Right of Patrons to Pre&s;entation of Mi|ni&s;ters to vacant Benefices, &amp;c. The&s;e I
<PB N="6" REF="6">
&s;ay, cry out loudly, <HI>The &V;nion was Bro|ken.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Epi&s;copal or Prelatick Party, finding, Her Maje|&s;ty her &s;elf (being Educated in the &s;ame Opinion) very Tender of them; the Church of <HI>England</HI> in Charity Embra|cing and E&s;pou&s;ing them; and the Times <HI>as they &s;uppo&s;ed</HI> Favouring them <HI>further than before,</HI> failed not to pu&s;h on their Intere&s;t, to pre&s;s for their Liberty, and Unhappily to lay their Hopes up|on that exploded Article, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Di&s;pen&s;ing Power of the Queen; promp|ting &s;everal things in their own Favour Incon&s;i&s;tent not with the Articles on|ly, but with the Con&s;titution of <HI>Britain,</HI> which if they could obtain, they would be the fir&s;t to boa&s;t of as an Infraction both of the Revolution and al&s;o of the Union; that &s;o they might look on the Union to be really Di&s;&s;olv'd in its own Nature, and that one Breach being made might ju&s;tify ma|king another: And &s;o on to a Rupture, which without wronging them it may be &s;aid, they above all things Pa&s;&s;i|onately De&s;ire, and therefore we find no People more forward to &s;ay the Union is already broken, tho' the ve|ry
<PB N="7" REF="7">
things which they will own to be Breaches of the Union were done in their Favour.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Second Head con&s;i&s;ts of State Matters, or the Affair of the Succe&s;&s;ion; <HI>between the Pretender and the Hou&s;e of Hanover,</HI> in the&s;e Affairs the Presbyterians tho' not at all in the Jacobite Intere&s;t, yet openly many of them refu&s;e to take the Abjuration, and when the &s;ame is Enforced and Impo&s;ed upon them under &s;evere Pe|nalties and Forfeitures, they loudly Complain of that Law as <HI>a Breach of the &V;nion,</HI> which Union they &s;ay (and that very truely) &s;tipulated, that <HI>no Oaths &s;hould be Impo&s;ed upon them Con|trary to their Principles,</HI> and this Oath, they &s;ay, is again&s;t their Principles, as it obliges them Voluntarily to for&s;wear and abjure a Presbyterian King <HI>as &s;uch;</HI> tho' otherwi&s;e his De&s;cent and Birth gave him an Unque&s;tioned Ti|tle to the Crown, therefore they &s;ay, <HI>The &V;nion is Broken and Di&s;&s;olved.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party bringing fir&s;t all their trea&s;onable Argu|ments to a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Just Claim</HI> (as they call it) of the <HI>Pretender</HI> to the Crown;
<PB N="8" REF="8">
affirm that &s;uch Right is hereditary and indefea&s;ible, and that no Humane Po|wer can legally &s;uper&s;ede that Claim. The <HI>&V;nion</HI> therefore having di&s;&s;olv'd the Con&s;titution, and &s;et a&s;ide the <HI>Law|ful Heir, as they would have him be called,</HI> is an unrighteous Act, contrary to the Laws of God, and the Nature of the thing, and is therefore void in its own Nature, di&s;&s;olves it &s;elf, and cannot &s;ub|&s;i&s;t in barr of his Right, which derives, as they alledge, from God alone. This cau&s;es them to join in the afore&s;aid Complaint, That <HI>the &V;nion is broken and di&s;&s;olved.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Third Head is, <HI>Matters of Property,</HI> &s;uch as Trade, Taxes, Cu&s;toms, Duties, &amp;c. and this brings us directly to the Ca&s;e in Hand, in which, upon the Parliament Voting the Malt Tax to be paid by all the Subjects of <HI>Great Bri|tain;</HI> a New, and none of the &s;ofte&s;t Cries is rai&s;ed in the Dialect of the Former <HI>(viz.)</HI> That <HI>the &V;nion is Bro|ken.</HI></P>
<P>I am heartily Sorry to &s;ee, and more to mention the Heat with which the&s;e things are managed; <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="9">
<HI>mean without Doors,</HI> for I enter my Prote&s;t here as early as po&s;&s;ible, that <HI>nothing &s;aid here be Con&s;trued to be meant of any thing done or tran&s;acted in ei|ther Hou&s;e of Parliament, or to reflect upon any Members of either Hou&s;e for any thing done in Parliament.</HI> But this I take for a Rule that may be followed, if any Man (tho' a Member of Parliament of either Hou&s;e) does &s;ay or act any thing out of his Parliamentary Capa|city out of the Hou&s;e and not as a Member, he is then <HI>as to that Action,</HI> to be Con&s;idered not as a Member of Parliament, but as a Briti&s;h Subject in Common with his Neighbours, and &s;uch Action of his may be Di&s;|cour&s;ed of equally with the Actions of other Men; for Example, if a Member of Parliament commit a Murther, a Robery, or any other Crime, &s;uppo&s;e he In&s;ults a Woman, a Man's Wife, a Magi&s;trate, or a Sovereign! As the Law &s;hall without doubt freely take its ordinary Cour&s;e to pre&s;erve the Life, Property, Cha|&s;tity, and Safety of the Subject with the Peace and Prerogative of the Go|vernment and Sovereign, it &s;hall no doubt bring &s;uch an Offender to Ju|&s;tice,
<PB N="10" REF="10">
notwith&s;tanding his Character as a Member, and as it will be no Breach of Privilege to have &s;uch Offences Pro&s;ecuted, &s;o neither would it be to Cen&s;ure tho&s;e Offences in Print or Writing, I hope I am not mi&s;taken in this Ca&s;e, and yet if I am, I &s;hall take care not to come within reach of the contrary: Well however: On this Ac|count, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I am &s;orry to &s;ee the Heat with which &s;ome People on both &s;ides carry on the pre&s;ent Contention about this Affair of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I will &s;peak of it as Cautiou&s;ly and Re&s;pectively as I can.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s the Taxing <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;eems a nice thing, for tho' it is True that it was left entirely <HI>in the Treaty of &V;nion</HI> to the Determination of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;o far as re|lates to &s;uch Taxes as are Exempted in the &s;aid Treaty of Union. <HI>So yet,</HI> there is an Expre&s;&s;ion in the Treaty fir&s;t made at <HI>London,</HI> which tho' it does not limit the &s;aid Parliament, yet it &s;eems to lay down a Rule which is recommended to the Par|liament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> (that &s;hould &s;ucceed) by the re&s;pective Parliament of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were
<PB N="11" REF="11">
then in being and to Expire, I &s;ay, recommended to the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to have their Eyes upon&punc; as much as they thought rea&s;onable, in their future Proceedings about Charging <HI>Scotland</HI> with Taxes. This Expre&s;&s;ion is thus;</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;That the Parliament of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to lay any &s;orts of Burdens upon the United King|doms, but what they &s;hall find of Nece&s;&s;ity at that Time for the Pre&s;er|vation and Good of the Whole, and with due Regard to the Circum&s;tances and Abilities of every Part of the Uni|ted Kingdom: Therefore it is agreed, that there be no further Exemption in&s;i&s;ted upon for any Part of the Uni|ted Kingdoms, but that the Con&s;i|deration of any Exemptions beyond what are already agreed on in this Treaty, &s;hall be left to the Determi|nation of the Parliament of <HI>Great Bri|tain.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I take this to be &s;omething like the Exhortations of an Aged and Tender Parent, or Parents on their Death Bed to their Son, who was upon the Point of taking a Wife; the Good Man tells his Son the particular Duties of his
<PB N="12" REF="12">
future Condition, as a Ma&s;ter of a Fa|mily, and as a Father to his Children; and particularly tells him perhaps, the Circum&s;tances of his Wife; what Re|&s;pect is due to her for the &s;ake of the Family he has taken her from: How Tenderly he &s;hould Treat her; how he &s;hould bear with her want of Temper, with her want of Fortune; and e&s;pecially, that he &s;hould never upbraid her with her Mean Circum|&s;tances, or le&s;&s;en her Jointure for want of her Fortune and the like; then ju&s;t lives to &s;ee them Married and Ex|pires.</P>
<P>Now it is True, the Son is not, in the Legal Con&s;titution of Husband and Wife bound by the&s;e Exhortations, nor can he be &s;aid at-all to break his Marriage Covenant if he does not follow the Advice of his Father, or u&s;e his Wife &s;o kindly as his Father Exhorted him to do; becau&s;e the Woman takes him upon the expre&s;s Terms of a Marriage, <HI>for Better for Wor&s;e,</HI> yet hardly any Man but will cau&s;e the Remembrance of his Dying Father's Exhortations and Recom|mendations to Influence his Conduct very much; and if he be a Kind and
<PB N="13" REF="13">
Tender Husband, <HI>It can hardly be &s;up|po&s;ed he will lay any burthen upon his Wife but what he &s;hall find of Nece&s;&s;ity at that time for the pre&s;ervation and Good of his Family, and with due Regard to her Circum&s;tances and Abilities.</HI></P>
<P>This I take to be &s;omething like the Ca&s;e here, and therefore, that what ever Unkindne&s;&s;es or Mi&s;under&s;tan|dings may thus pa&s;s on either fide be|tween the Marryed Couple, <HI>i. e. The Two Nations,</HI> yet that this can by no means be called a Breach of the Mar|riage Contract: Nor can either &s;ide Claim thereby, that the Marriage or Union &s;hould be Di&s;&s;olved, which in|deed by the Nature of the Bargain cannot be done, no not by the mutual Con&s;ent of the Parties Marryed or United.</P>
<P>I might carry this Simily much further, but this Ca&s;e admits not to be &s;poken of in Parables; we are now come to &s;uch a height in the mi&s;un|der&s;tanding of one another, that he who will &s;peak of the thing to the Purpo&s;e, mu&s;t &s;peak of it in the plain Language, which the People he &s;peaks to make u&s;e of in it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14">
The Occa&s;ions of the Nation re|quire, that the Malt Tax as it is ge|nerally called, &s;hould be laid on by the Parliament for the Year 1713, and accordingly a Bill has pa&s;s'd the Hou&s;e of Commons (as <HI>per</HI> their Votes) for laying the u&s;ual Duty of 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Quarter, or 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Bu&s;hell upon Malt, Commencing the 24th of <HI>June</HI> next, by which Bill as we are told by the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen who are without Doors, the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> are charged with the &s;aid Duties which they never were before, having been Exempted from it by the Articles of the Union.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid for or again&s;t this Bill in the Hou&s;e of Commons while it was in Debate there, this I may not &s;peak of here. But I find the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen, I &s;ay, who are in Town, and not in the Hou&s;e, in a Fer|ment hardly to be de&s;cribed about it, and from them it runs thro' all the Town, and is now in every Bodies Mouth, thus or in Words to this pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>That <HI>Scotland</HI> is Ruined, that the Tax is an Intollerable Burthen, that they are not Treated in it with Ju|&s;tice and in an Equality, which was
<PB N="15" REF="15">
in all other Taxes laid down, as the &s;tated Method of Taxing <HI>Scotland</HI> at the time of the Union; that they were told, that in all Taxings the Circum|&s;tances and Abillity of <HI>Scotland</HI> to bear the Taxes which were to be Impo&s;ed &s;hould be Con&s;idered, and that this is expre&s;ly mentioned as the rea&s;on which induced the <HI>Scots</HI> in the Treaty of Union to &s;ubmit the matter of future Taxings to the Wi&s;dom of a Briti&s;h Parliament, who it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed would lay any &s;ort of Burthens upon the United Kingdom, but with due Regard to the &s;aid Cir|cum&s;tances, and to the Abillity of e|very Part of the &s;aid Kingdom to bear the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Others carrying their Di&s;&s;atisfaction higher, forgetting Decency, and the Re&s;pect due, not to the Parliament only, but to the whole Government al&s;o, talk with a Freedom not fit to be repeated <HI>(viz.)</HI> Of the <HI>&V;nion</HI> being broken, the Contract void, and that they will go to the Queen, and laying their Rea&s;ons be|fore Her Maje&s;ty, humbly de&s;ire her to declare the <HI>&V;nion</HI> di&s;&s;olved, and to re|mit the Nations back to their re&s;pective &s;eparate State and Independency one on another.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16">
Whether any one has gone of this Er|rand or no, or will go, is not the Sub|ject of my Speculation at this time; but it may come under Enquiry, and &s;uch People would do well to con&s;i|der before they proceed to &s;uch an ex|traordinary Step as that&mdash;Whether they are not a&s;&s;ured before they offer &s;uch a thing to the Queen, that it is what her Maje&s;ty can do; and then what they may be &s;aid to be guilty of, who go to any Per&s;on to ask a thing, which they know before they go, the Per&s;on they go to cannot grant.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t Ca&s;es that I could name, &s;uch a thing would be call'd bantering the Per&s;on, in &s;ome Ca&s;es it would be called in&s;ulting; what it may be called in this Ca&s;e is not fit for me to determine, Her Maje&s;ty will not be at a Lo&s;s what Opinion to pa&s;s upon it.</P>
<P>In the mean time I mu&s;t acknowledge I meet with none, no not one Man of Sen&s;e and of Moderation, but what condemns and cen&s;ures the Action as wanting in Re&s;pect, in Prudence and in Policy; and it may be hoped &s;uch a general Di&s;like will influence the Gentlemen not to think of taking &s;uch a Step; if any have done it already, I &s;ay no|thing at all to that part, what I &s;ay, is to per&s;uade and prevail upon tho&s;e who have no$
<PB N="17" REF="17">
done it, that they may lay a&s;ide the Thoughts of it, as a thing not to be ju&s;tify'd to their Rea&s;on or Duty, and is nothing at all to tho&s;e who may have &s;o far forgotten them&s;elves, as to have taken any wrong &s;tep already.</P>
<P>The principal Rea&s;on why I mention this is, becau&s;e I cannot &s;ee with all the Eyes I have, or with all the Rea&s;oning I can think of, that there is the lea&s;t Ground in all this, to &s;ay or &s;ugge&s;t that <HI>the &V;nion is broken,</HI> much le&s;s that the Convention or Agreement between the two Nations IS DISSOLVED by this Act; and if, whatever may have been before, this is not &s;o, then all the Rea&s;ons they give for the Un|ea&s;ine&s;s above&s;aid fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>Let none &s;ugge&s;t that becau&s;e I in&s;i&s;t upon it that the <HI>&V;nion</HI> is not broken and di&s;&s;olved, that therefore I am to argue for the Charging <HI>Scot|land</HI> with the Malt Tax; it is evident that the Doing or not Doing it is out of the que&s;tion, as well as out of the province of a Pamphlet to debate, (1) Becau&s;e the thing is done, and (2) Becau&s;e it is the Legality of the Fact only that we are now &s;peaking of, not the Conveni|ence of it.</P>
<P>I regret exceedingly the thing, I lament the heavy Burthen this Tax will be to poor <HI>Scot|land;</HI> and am willing to expre&s;s my &s;elf as much that way, as a &s;incere Sorrow for a Di&s;|a&s;ter to that Nation can require; but there is a great difference between being very &s;orry that it is &s;o, and crying out again&s;t the Parliament as injurious, &s;aying it is illegal, contrary to Articles, and a Breach of the &s;tipulated A|greement with <HI>Scotland,</HI> complaining of <HI>En|gland</HI> as treacherous, fal&s;e, a Breaker of Trea|ties, &amp;c. and that therefore the <HI>&V;nion</HI> is di&s;|&s;olved:</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18">
This I can by no means allow, but on the con|try &s;hall prove that <HI>Scotland</HI> her &s;elf, even by the Treaty of <HI>&V;nion,</HI> has agreed and con&s;ented that this Tax &s;hould, at this time too, be laid upon them, if the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament thought it needful to be &s;o.</P>
<P>If this can be proved, then I think the In|temperance of all the Mea&s;ures which any have taken, or may take, in their cen&s;uring the Proceedings of the Parliament, will &s;ufficiently be reproved.</P>
<P>To prove this we need go no further than the Treaty it &s;elf, and the Articles, which ex|pre&s;ly declare (1) That no Exemptions but &s;uch as are mentioned in the &s;aid Articles, &s;hall be in&s;i&s;ted. (2) That all Exemptions from Du|ties, or Laying on Duties, with relation to <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hall be, and is thereby wholly left to the Determination of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot then but be in the brea&s;t of the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to judge when it is proper to tax <HI>Scotland</HI> with any Payment what&s;oever, which is not expre&s;s'd to be ex|empted, and which <HI>Scotland</HI> is not directly freed from in the Articles of the <HI>&V;nion.</HI></P>
<P>But to bring this nearer, we are next to exa|mine how the particular Ca&s;e of the Malt Tax &s;tands, with re&s;pect to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for this to look back not to the Articles only, but to the Debates of the Commi&s;&s;ioners and Parliamen$ about this very Tax, and the Articles of U|nion. The&s;e are at large &s;et down in <HI>De Foe'$ Hi&s;tory of the &V;nion,</HI> which however being to$ long to be repeated here, will be in part &s;up|ply'd by the Following brief Account of it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19">
The Fir&s;t Treaty was carry'd on at <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1708; in which Treaty the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> had propo&s;ed an E|quality of all Taxes to be laid upon the United Kingdom. The Words are the&s;e, <HI>That there be the &s;ame Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es, and all other Taxes, and the &s;ame Prohibitions, Re&s;trictions, and Regula|tions of Trade, throughout the &V;nited Kingdom of</HI> Great Britain. <HI>Vide</HI> the Minutes, 29th of A|pril 1706.

But propo&s;e an Exemp|tion from all other Burthens and Exci&s;es, within</HI> Scotland, <HI>for a competent time, to be adju&s;ted in the Cour&s;e of the Treaty</HI> Ibid. Fol. 33. It is nece&s;&s;ary, as we quote this, to give the Rea&s;ons alledged for this Demand of Exemption, which were thus expre&s;&s;ed <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> may by the Benefit ari&s;ing by the Communication of Trade, be put in a Capacity to bear a Proportion of Burthens and Exci&s;es, and they hope the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>En|gland</HI> will be convinc'd, that the Immunity from tho&s;e other Burthens and Exci&s;es for a Term of Years, is con&s;i&s;tent with an entire U|nion, and will not put the Trade on an une|qual foot, when the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of Both Kingdoms are duely con&s;ider'd. <HI>Ibid. Fol.</HI> 34. <HI>Part</HI> iv.</P>
<P><HI>The An&s;wer to this Propo&s;al is &s;et down at large, but is in Effect this,</HI> That the Lords, Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> to &s;hew their readyne&s;s to comply with every thing that was rea&s;onable to the bringing the Treaty to a good Effect, are wil|ling to enter into the Con&s;ideration of the particu|lar

<P>The&s;e things as mentioned here make it Evident, that the Exemption of the&s;e Bur|thens and Exci&s;es for a competent Time only, was propo&s;ed even by the <HI>Scots</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves. That is, that they did not under&s;tand or de&s;ire to have it under&s;tood, that the &s;aid Exemption &s;hould or could be perpetual. This farther appears in the De|bates upon that Head the 17th of <HI>May</HI> follow|ing, thus, <HI>The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for</HI> Scotland <HI>from their Con&s;ideration of the pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances of</HI> Scotland <HI>find them&s;elves under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity to renew their Propo&s;al for an Exemption fer &s;ome competent Time, from all other Exerci&s;es and Burthens: That the Subjects of</HI> Scotland <HI>may by the Benefit of Trade be enabled Cheerfully to bear an Equality of all other Burthens.</HI> ib.

<P>In the Debates of the 18th of <HI>May,</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners an&s;wered, That they under&s;tood this Exemption to extend only to &s;uch Duties as then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in <HI>England:</HI> But if the <HI>Scots</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners would extend their Propo&s;al of the 13th to an Exemption from all Burthens and Exci&s;es, which the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> may hereafter find nece&s;&s;ary to impo&s;e on the United Kingdom. The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>England</HI> are of Opi|nion, that it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed the Parlia|ment of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will ever lay any &s;ort
<PB N="21" REF="21">
of Burthens upon the United Kingdom, but what they &s;hall find of Nece&s;&s;ity at that Time for the Pre&s;ervation and Good of the Whole, and with due Regard to the Circum&s;tances and Abilities of every Part of the United King|dom, and to allow of any Suppo&s;ition to the contrary, would be to form and &s;et up an un|an&s;werable Argument again&s;t the Union it &s;elf.</P>
<P>To this the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland,</HI> after long Deliberations con&s;ented, and the fir&s;t Treaty was concluded with no other Provi&s;ion again&s;t the Malt Tax than an Exemption from it during that current Year, as is expre&s;s'd in the 13th Article as follows.</P>
<P>That during the continuance of the Duty upon Malt payable in <HI>England,</HI> which determines the <HI>24</HI>th Day of <HI>June 1707, Scotland</HI> &s;hall not be charg'd with that Duty.</P>
<P>But when this Treaty came to be Debated in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and things were not carry'd on with &s;uch Temper and Mutual Confidence as they had been in the Treaty in <HI>England:</HI> The Parliament in <HI>Scotland</HI> after &s;everal Debates, thought fit to Grant a longer Exemption for &s;everal Duties, and for this of the Malt among the re&s;t, take it thus.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD><HI>Friday</HI> the 6th of <HI>December</HI> 1706.</HEAD>
<P>The Debates of the Day were upon the Af|fair of the Malt Tax, the previous Que&s;tion had been put <HI>(viz.)</HI> Whether the Exemption from the Malt Tax &s;hould be Temporary or Perpetual? And it was carryed Temporary.</P>
<P>Then the main Que&s;tion was put, Whether the Exemption from any Impo&s;ition on Malt in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould be during this pre&s;ent War, or for a longer time, and carryed during the pre|&s;ent War only?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="22">
The Difficulties in the&s;e things in <HI>Scotland</HI> ari&s;e from this Que&s;tion, Whether they &s;hould depend upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament maintain|ing a ju&s;t and an equal Regard to the good of the whole United I&s;land after the Union, and that they would have Re&s;pect to the Circum|&s;tances of every Part in their laying Taxes? Or whether they &s;hould Pin them down in all time coming, that no other Burthens or Taxes &s;hould be laid on, than tho&s;e already mention'd?</P>
<P>The Suppo&s;ition of the Parliament of <HI>Bri|tain</HI>'s being Partial again&s;t <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Re|pre&s;entatives of <HI>Scotland</HI> being few being oppre&s;|&s;ed and out Voted, as I have noted already, tho' it was a popular Notion and improved to an extravagant Height without Doors, yet it had not obtain'd &s;o as to be own'd in the Parliament, nor indeed could any Man with ju&s;t Rea&s;on have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch a thing, and therefore to offer at a po&s;itive Limitation on the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;eem'd to have &s;omething in it very har&s;h.</P>
<P>Again, it was alledg'd, That to Limit the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> not to lay on any other Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;es, Taxes, Duties or Burthens, than tho&s;e con&s;ented to in this Act, was to take away the Power from the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to conform their Affairs even to their own Circum&s;tances, &s;ince the time might come when &s;ome of the&s;e Duties might be|come burthen&s;ome that now were not &s;o, and others which now would be burthen&s;ome, might be more for the Publick Service; but to tye the Parliament down ab&s;olutely, as in this ca&s;e, would be to limit them from making Alterations in the pubiick Taxes, tho' apparently for the publick Advantage, and would in effect take from from them that Power for which they were really con&s;titu+ted, <HI>viz.</HI> to di&s;po&s;e the Peoples Pur&s;es, and redre&s;s thei$ Grievanc$.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">
It was long argued that the Parliament ought to be limit|ted in this Ca&s;e, becau&s;e of the danger there was of <HI>Scot|land</HI> being burthen'd with intolerable Taxes, and of the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were allow'd to be unable to bear them. That under the Pretence of alte|ration of Taxes, oppre&s;&s;ive Duties might be laid upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> which tho' they might be tolerable in <HI>England,</HI> were not &s;o here, and they ought to provide again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But it was re&s;olv'd at la&s;t into this, That all future Contingences mu&s;t be left to a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, and the words of the Arcicles contain a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for &s;o doing</P>
<P>And thus with &s;ome Difficulty the Clau&s;e was pa&s;&s;ed, without any further Amendment.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uch clear Te&s;timonies, That the limiting the Exemption of the Malt Tax in <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Term of the War, was the meer Act and Deed of the Parlia|ment in <HI>Scotland.</HI> That it was &s;o far from being thought a &s;hort while or a Hard&s;hip, that it was the Effect of their warme&s;t Debates and highe&s;t Di&s;tru&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> That <HI>Treaters</HI> or <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> from <HI>Scotland</HI> at the Treaty at <HI>London,</HI> had acquie&s;ced with the Exemption only for the current Year, leaving the re&s;t to the Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament. But that the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Di&s;&s;atisfaction, or at lea&s;t, le&s;s Confidence in the &s;aid <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament at that time, made an Amend|ment to the Fir&s;t Treaty, in the&s;e Words, <HI>viz. That the Duties on Malt now payable in</HI> England, <HI>&s;hall not be Charged upon t e Subjects of</HI> Scotland, <HI>during the Continuance of the pre&s;ent War.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Foundation the Legality of the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Of laying on the Malt Duty upon the Subject of <HI>Scotland;</HI> &s;o that all the Pretence for its being a Breach of the <HI>&V;nion</HI> is really taken away, the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament ha|ving con&s;ented and agreed that the Exemption &s;hould ex|tend to the End of the War only. This was the utmo&s;t the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon, and the Words are made a Clau&s;e in the xv Article of the <HI>&V;nion.</HI></P>
<P>I think it would be of no &s;ignification to mention here the Cavils of &s;ome People about the Words, <HI>The End of the Pre&s;ent War;</HI> as that the War is not ended, the Ratifi|cations of the Peace with all the Allies being not actually exchanged, as particularly with <HI>Spain.</HI> This is of &s;o lit|tle moment, the War being acknowledg'd on all hands to be at an end, that it needs no other An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Upon what other Suppo&s;ition the Gentlemen of the North can &s;ugge&s;t the <HI>&V;nion</HI> is broken and di&s;&s;olved, I mean particularly as it relates to the Malt Tax, we can|not
<PB N="24" REF="24">
prejudge, neither can any An&s;wer be given thereto, until tho&s;e other Suppo&s;itions may appear.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing then from the Di&s;pute of the Legality of this Tax being now laid upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> and its Con&s;i&s;tency with the <HI>&V;nion,</HI> Two things remain before us, which being lightly touch'd contain the whole Argument <HI>(viz.)</HI> 1. <HI>What can be &s;aid in Defence of the violent Re&s;entments which &s;ome People are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s on this Occa&s;ion;</HI> and (2) <HI>What will be the Con&s;equences of this Duty in</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>(1)</HI> What &s;hall we &s;ay to the warm Expre&s;&s;ions of Re&s;ent|ment which are made &s;o publick among &s;ome Men upon this Occa&s;ion, even to a Degree that I think is criminal, as it has been threatning to the Con&s;titution and publick Peace.</P>
<P>As to that I think nothing can be &s;aid to ju&s;tify it, and therefore to &s;ay nothing at all to it, is to &s;hew &s;uch a Ten|derne&s;s to the Per&s;ons as they ought to think them&s;elves very much oblig'd by. Indi&s;cretions are be&s;t forgotten, Time will make the Per&s;ons them&s;elves remember them, and be very glad they were permitted to go no farther.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged, <HI>Scotland</HI> will be pinch'd hard by the Duties upon Malt, but to talk Di&s;loyally and Undutifully upon &s;uch a Head is to make that a Crime, which is only a Misfortune. Nor have the People who thus Expre&s;s them&s;elves, the lea&s;t pretence for &s;aying they &s;peak the Lar|guage of <HI>Scotland,</HI> when they talk thus. The People of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be Aggrieved, and may Complain of tho&s;e Grievances, but they never, e&s;pecially as a Nation or Body extend tho&s;e Complaints beyond the Duty of Good Sub|jects.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>What will be the Con&s;equence of this Duty in</HI> Scot|land? It is allowed, it will fall hard: But <HI>England</HI> has many Ways to make <HI>Scotland</HI> amends for any Hard&s;hip they may fall under on this Account. One way e&s;pecially would be to pa&s;s an Act that the Ale which is now 1 <HI>d. per</HI> Chopin or Quart, may be &s;old at Five Farthings, or. Three Half-pence by the Retailer, and in proportion by the Common Brewer, without advancing the Duty of Exci&s;e, which without &s;uch an Act they cannot do.</P>
<P>Since the&s;e Sheets were in the Pre&s;s, we &s;ee the Hou&s;e of Commons about to take into con&s;ideration that Part of Her Maje&s;ty's Speech which relates to the Encouragement of the Fi&s;hery. This is a large Field, in which there is a|bundance of room to do <HI>Scotland</HI> good and <HI>England</HI> al&s;o, and by which, if &s;uitable &s;teps, are taken, <HI>England</HI> may find ways and means &s;o to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Scotland</HI> in Trade, in circulati|on of Money, and in employment of the Poor, &s;o as that the Malt Tax &s;hall be no Burthen to them.</P>
