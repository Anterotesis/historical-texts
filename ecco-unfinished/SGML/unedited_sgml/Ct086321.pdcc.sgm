<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following lines were occa&s;ioned by the Author's having lately &s;tudied, with infinite attention, &s;everal fa&s;hionable productions in the <HI>Sentimental</HI> &s;tile; in mo&s;t of which, a mi&s;applica|tion, not a defect, of talents &s;eems to have betrayed their Authors into &s;ome degree of fal&s;e Ta&s;te. For example. A Noble Author has lately publi&s;hed his works, which con&s;i&s;t of <HI>three</HI> compo&s;itions. <HI>One,</HI> an Ode upon the death of Mr. Gray: the <HI>two</HI> others, upon the death of his Lord&s;hip's <HI>Spaniel.</HI></P>
<P>But the reigning fa&s;hion in modern <HI>poe&s;y</HI> is <HI>Senti|mental Panegyrick</HI> on <HI>Married Beauties.</HI> This ap|pears in a thou&s;and various Shapes; from <HI>Bouts Rhime&egrave;s</HI> on the <HI>wou'd-be Sappho</HI> of Bath, up to <HI>Doggerel Epi&s;tles</HI> to the lovely <HI>Amoret.</HI></P>
<P>In attempting to ridicule this modi&s;h folly, it is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to apologize to the &s;everal Per&s;on|ages of the <HI>Sentimental train,</HI> for introducing their names. When a Poet announces him&s;elf, and
<PB N="iv" REF="3">publicly wears his Laurels, He is lawful game for the Critics: And it makes no difference, whether his works come from the Pre&s;s, or, according to Sir <HI>Benjamin Backbite</HI>'s &s;y&s;tem, <HI>"circulate in Manu|&s;cript."</HI> Be&s;ides, to canva&s;s the <HI>&s;lighter imperfections,</HI> either of &s;tile or of conduct, &s;eems to be the limit of poetical cen&s;ure. It is only the de&s;perate Saty|ri&s;t, who&s;e invenomed pen &s;trikes at the character and honour of Individuals, that perverts and di&s;|graces Poetry:&mdash;Such a&s;per&s;ions, if well founded, are too gro&s;s for the tribunal of the Mu&s;es; and if, (as is generally the ca&s;e) they are utterly fal&s;e, they recoil not only on the Author, but on the very art it&s;elf, which can &s;o ea&s;ily be perverted to &s;o bad a Purpo&s;e.&mdash; But who can be hurt by a Critique on his <HI>Charades</HI> and <HI>Rebu&s;&s;es?</HI>&mdash;An imputation of fal&s;e Ta&s;te may not be very plea&s;ant, but it never can &s;eriou&s;ly offend Men of &s;en&s;e and good-breeding: Both which qualities, as the Author agrees with all the world in acknowledging <HI>his Per&s;onages</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s in the highe&s;t degree, &s;o he reque&s;ts that not only they, but the few others who may happen to read his Poem, will acquit him of any intention to give the &s;lighte&s;t offence.</P>
