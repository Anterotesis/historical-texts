<HEAD>To the Honourable and mo&s;t Excellent Matron, Mrs. <HI>Rebecca Woollpack,</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Humble Repre&s;entation and Petiti|on of <HI>Dorothy Di&s;taff, Abigail Spin|ning-Wheel, Eleanor Reel,</HI> of St. <HI>Edmunds-bury</HI> in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> Spin&s;ters; in Behalf of them|&s;elves and many Thou&s;ands of the Female Manufacturers of Wooll and Wor&s;ted Yarn in the &s;aid County, and in the Counties of <HI>Norfolk, E&s;&s;ex, Huntington, Cambridge, Hert|ford, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Humbly Sheweth,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THAT Your Petitioners have for many Years been chear|fully Employ'd in the Wool|len Manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> that is to &s;ay, in the Spinning of Wor&s;t|ed Yarn for the Stuff Weavers of <HI>Nor|wich</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
and of <HI>London,</HI> by which we have very comfortably maintain'd and &s;up|ported our &s;elves in &s;uch manner, as that we have upon all Occa&s;ions ap|pear'd decently at Church; that is to &s;ay, with a clean Pinner, a Cherry co|lour'd Chin-knot, a white Apron, and a clean Pair of Gloves, &s;o that our Sweet&punc;hearts have not been a&s;ham'd of us; nay, &s;ome of us, who have &s;et to our Work harder than ordinary, have ob|tain'd, by long Labour and good Hou&s;|wifry, a narrow <HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> Edging to our Pinnars, to the great Improvement of our Neighbour-La&s;&s;es of that Coun|ty, and the Encouragement of the Ma|nufacture of Bone-Lace al&s;o.</P>
<P>We al&s;o farther humbly repre&s;ent, That in &s;ome Parts of the County where our Fellow-Spinners are poorer, and have not Fathers and Mothers to work for them, as we who are good Farmers and Husbandmens Daughters, may be &s;up|pos'd to have; but where, on the contra|ry, the Money earn'd by the Labour of the poor Women and Children is em|ploy'd for their dayly Sub&s;i&s;tence, yet that even there, may it plea&s;e your Lady|&s;hip, the indu&s;trious poor Women have, by the Help of the Spinning of Wor&s;ted Yarn, as afore&s;aid, maintain'd their &s;aid
<PB N="7" REF="5">
Families, and kept them&s;elves and their &s;aid Children from Mi&s;ery, and from be|ing chargeable to the Pari&s;h, tho' with very hard Work and the utmo&s;t Indu&s;try and Application.</P>
<P>But now, and't plea&s;e your Lady|&s;hip, there is &s;ad and dreadful News come among us, as well from <HI>Norwich</HI> as from <HI>London,</HI> where our Ma&s;ters who employ us &s;ell their Yarn, and from whence they always, till now, had Encouragement to &s;et us to Work, as al&s;o from all other Parts of the Coun|try, &s;ignifying to us, that all the Ladies of <HI>London,</HI> the Honourable and Right Honourable Spin&s;ters of <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> and all over <HI>England,</HI> and even your Lady&s;hip among the re&s;t, have on a &s;udden, and to our great Surprize and Amazement, given over the U&s;e and Wearing of the good hone&s;t old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures of Wooll and of Wor&s;ted, and of Silk mixt with Wooll, Things in which we always believ'd here in the Country that we look'd as pretty, and appear'd as tempting and agreeable to our Lo|vers and Sweet-hearts, as in any Thing we can get to wear, and in which we have been told the City-Spin&s;ters have been as high and as proud as ever they can or will be in any Thing el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">
And this is not all, but and't plea&s;e your Lady&s;hip, our &s;aid Ma&s;ters tell us the heavy Tidings, that upon this Hu|mour of the Ladies, many Woollen Stuffs, and Stuffs mixt with Silk, and even Silks them&s;elves, are in a very great mea&s;ure laid a&s;ide; that &s;ome of them are quite lo&s;t, and thrown out of Sale, &s;uch as Brilliants and Pulerays, Antherines and Bumbazines, Sattinets and Chiverets, Oraguella's, Grazetts, great Variety of Silk and Wor&s;ted Foot|works, Flower'd Grazetts, Flower'd Silk and Wor&s;ted Tammy Draughts, and Da|masks, Fine Colour'd Crapes, &amp;c. and that they cannot &s;ell their Wor&s;ted Yarn as u&s;ual at <HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> neither have they any more Work for us to do, any Wooll to put out, or Money to pay for the Spinning, the Market being &s;topt as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>May it plea&s;e your Lady&s;hip then to con&s;ider what a &s;ad and deplorable Con|dition we are now reduc'd to in the Country; for as to us, your Petitioners, tho' we are as above, Farmers and Hus|bandmen's Daughters, and our Parents do make &s;hift to give us Victuals and Drink, yet that we are utterly ruin'd, for we can now get no new Cloaths, no Knots, no Edgings, as we ob&s;erv'd to
<PB N="9" REF="7">
your Lady&s;hips, and without which your Lady&s;hip well knows we &s;hall get no Sweet-hearts, for we cannot go to the Market nor to the Fair, as u&s;ual; and your Lady&s;hip knows what will be the mi&s;erable Con&s;equences of the&s;e Things, for that the young Men do not come after us now, to our Fathers Hou&s;es, as they u&s;ed to do, but always expect to &s;ee us at Market-Towns; &s;o that if &s;ome &s;peedy Cour&s;e be not taken in this Mat|ter, we are in Danger of being utterly undone.</P>
<P>And as for the poor Women and Children in the Country, as above, who&s;e Employment and whole Sub&s;i&s;tence de|pends upon the Manufactures, and who mu&s;t Spin, or they and their Families mu&s;t &s;trave. It were impo&s;&s;ible, could your Lady&s;hip hear the &s;ad Lamentations of tho&s;e Mi&s;erable Families, but your Heart would bleed for them, and you would never wear any Thing that would con|tribute &s;o much to the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Poor.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, we humbly crave Leave to lay before your Lady&s;hip, that, as we are inform'd, all this &s;uddain Change, which is apparently to the Ruin of &s;o many Thou&s;ands of your Petitioners, is brought about in Favour
<PB N="10" REF="8">
of a tawdery, Pie-&s;potted, flabby, rag|ged, low-priz'd Thing, call'd <HI>Callicoe;</HI> a Foreigner by Birth; made the L...d knows where, by a Parcel of <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Pagans,</HI> that wor&s;hip the Devil, and work for a Half-penny a Day.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e humbly repre&s;ent to your Lady&s;hip, that all this Mi&s;ery and Di|&s;tre&s;s, which is and will be the Con&s;e|quence of the Ladies falling, with &s;uch a Gu&s;t, into this new outlandi&s;h Fa&s;hion, is laid wholly at the Door of your own Fancies; that you have not been prom|pted to it by your Husbands, or invited into it by your Sweet-hearts or Lovers; for the Men, it &s;eems, do not wear any of it them&s;elves, nor do they find that you &s;ave them any Money in their Pockets by it, as we &s;hall fully prove to you af|terwards: We &s;ay, it is all laid at your Door, and we are given to under&s;tand, that while the Men in vain have repre|&s;ented to your Lady&s;hip, that it will be ruinous and de&s;tructive to the Trade of the Nation, and to the Woollen Manu|factures, and de&s;ir'd you, tho' to no Pur|po&s;e, to be per&s;uaded to lay it a&s;ide, you are all the more ob&s;tinate in the U&s;e of it; &s;o that they are now oblig'd to lay it before the Parliament, in order to <HI>force</HI> you to alter the Mode, and to dre&s;s in
<PB N="11" REF="9">
the good, hone&s;t, home-&s;pun Manufac|tures of <HI>England;</HI> which, by the Way, will be not only much again&s;t the Grain, as to the Fa&s;hion it&s;elf, but will al&s;o be much to your Di&s;honour, that you &s;hould be &s;o commanded by the Men to lay it down, and be brought to do it by FORCE.</P>
<P>We mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreat your Lady|&s;hip, therefore, to con&s;ider what great Re|proach you are going to bring upon your|&s;elves, and upon us all, and what Injury even your Children and Grand-Children of our Sex may &s;u&s;tain, by thus bringing us all under a Sort of Subjection to the Men, in the Modes of our Dre&s;s; <HI>a Yoke</HI> from Hu&s;bands, <HI>which neither we or our Mothers have ever been able to bear.</HI> It ought, doubtle&s;s, to be above the Dig|nity of our Sex to be thus brought under this Bondage; and, therefore, we mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech you to let this Change be the Work of your own Choice; and not &s;uffer it to be impo&s;ed upon you by the Men, who will certainly, if they carry this Point, take upon them for the future to bring in Sumptuary Laws upon us, and oblige us to wear &s;uch Cloaths as they think fit; or otherwi&s;e, which would be intolerable, (and which we hope you would make an In&s;urrection rather than &s;ubmit to) oblige the Ladies to wear no
<PB N="12" REF="10">
Cloaths any richer than their Hu&s;bands can pay for.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides all this, we de&s;ire your La|dy&s;hip, in the humble&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible, to take the Condition of our poor Sex into your mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration: We mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately repre&s;ent to your Lady&s;hip how much you are really intru&s;ted in this Affair; how the Wor&s;hipful your Lady&s;hip's Grandfather was a <HI>Wooll|pack,</HI> the good old Squire rais'd all his Fortunes by us Spinners, and many a comely Country La&s;s has manufactur'd for him. Old Sir <HI>Harry Wooll-combe,</HI> of <HI>Bury St. Edmonds,</HI> was al&s;o near of Kin to you, Madam, and he got a great E|&s;tate from the <HI>Comb-Pot,</HI> and made all his Daughters Ladies and Gentle-folks. Be&s;ides, your Lady&s;hip is ally'd, by &s;ome Removes, to a great many Right Honoura|ble Per&s;ons, the direct Offspring of the mo&s;t ancient Families in <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> &s;uch as the Families of the <HI>Oumblers,</HI> the <HI>Staplers,</HI> and the ancient <HI>Tre&s;|&s;el-Beaters,</HI> and others. L&mdash;d, Madam, can you forget the Graves of your Ance|&s;tors, and the grey Hairs of your Fore-Fathers? If they &s;hould ri&s;e from the Dead now, and &s;ee you dre&s;s'd up in your painted Trangums, and <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Rags, while all the poor Spinners hung
<PB N="13" REF="11">
about you crying for Bread and for Work; good your Lady&s;hip, what think you my good Ma&s;ters would &s;ay to it, would they not carry you away a Pick-a-pack.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, may it plea&s;e your good Lady|&s;hip to con&s;ider, that if the Honour of your Family is not &s;upported and main|tain'd, which, by the way, can never be done, if a Stop is not put to the Wea|ring the&s;e Callicoe Trumpery, you can never maintain or &s;upport your Cha|racter; for, we be&s;eech your Lady&s;hip, if the Wooll comes to lie on Hand, and not be &s;pun and work'd up, what will all the Family of the <HI>Wooll-Packs</HI> come to? They will certainly be laid by till they rot, and come to Rags. We have often &s;een, Madam, &s;ome of the large&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing of you <HI>Wooll-Packs,</HI> when the Market has been dull, and the Wooll would not go off, &s;uffer great Lo&s;s, and be reduc'd to a very tatter'd Condition.</P>
<P>Nay, let me recommend it to your Con&s;ideration, that if this goes on, the be&s;t of your Expectations, and of tho&s;e other Ladies of your Family, may be to be &s;ent over to <HI>France;</HI> and there, if nothing wor&s;e &s;hould happen to you, yet you mu&s;t change your Religion, and you
<PB N="14" REF="12">
would all become Popi&s;h <HI>Woollpacks,</HI> whether you would or no.</P>
<P>And as for us poor Spin&s;ters, we mu&s;t certainly go away to <HI>France</HI> al&s;o. Nay, there is a particular Rea&s;on for that, which we have not mention'd yet; and that is, that here is abundance of the young Men, &s;uch as we u&s;ed to pitch upon for our be&s;t Thoughts, and who, when they had Work, were pretty clean Fellows, and went well dre&s;s'd a <HI>Sun|days;</HI> who were Manufacturers, and liv'd very well, have been forc'd &s;ince to go down to the Sea-Side, and there they tell us are <HI>French</HI> Folks and <HI>Dutch</HI> Folks at <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> and other Places, that give them Money to go Abroad, and &s;o we never &s;ee them more: And a&s;&s;ure your|&s;elf, and't plea&s;e your Lady&s;hip, that if all our Sweet-hearts run away, we will all go after them, and then you may e'en &s;pin your Wooll-Packs your|&s;elf.</P>
<P>But we hope your Lady&s;hip will be prevail'd upon by the Tears of your own Sex, and by the Mi&s;eries of the Poor, which you cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of, to commi&s;erate the poor Country, and &s;et your helping Hand to a Work &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary to be done, and (which is more than all the re&s;t) is &s;o ea&s;y for you to do.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13">
Which brings us to the main Subject of this your Petitioners humble Repre|&s;entation, namely, That your Lady&s;hip would con&s;ider how much it is in your Power, at one Turn of your Hand, to put an End to all the&s;e Mi&s;eries of your Coun|try, and to wipe up the Tears of all the poor Families in the Nation, by only vouch&s;afing to &s;ubmit your Fancy to your Rea&s;on, and by bringing your Hu|mour and your Judgment to corre&s;pond a little together.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for once, that your Fancy, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, according to the laudable Cu&s;tom of our Sex, does now run for the Gewgaws of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> as &s;ometimes it has done, informer Days, for tho&s;e of <HI>France.</HI> But, &s;ure, when you are convinc'd, that this U&s;age of yours tends to the entire De&s;truction of the Manufactures of your Country, that it will of Cour&s;e turn Thou&s;ands of poor Women and Children into the Streets a begging, and to the Pari&s;hes for Support; that the Trade &s;hall be univer&s;ally in|fluenc'd by it, and that a great many de|vili&s;h, thieving, running, cheating Trades, are brought in among us by it, to the Ruin of the fair Trader; we &s;ay, when your Lady&s;hip is convinc'd of this, we are per&s;uaded you will throw your fine
<PB N="16" REF="14">
Chints Gown and Petticoat in the Fire, and declare that you will never more wear any Thing &s;o prejudicial to the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Manufacture, or &s;o dangerous to the Wor&s;hipful Family of the <HI>Wooll-Packs.</HI></P>
<P>Permit us, and't plea&s;e your Lady|&s;hip, in the next Place, humbly to repre&s;ent to your Con&s;ideration how ab&s;olutely it is re&s;erv'd in your own Power, and in your own Hands, to effect this; and to all Intents and Purpo&s;es to re&s;cue all the poor Manufacturers in the Nation from the Bondage and Mi&s;ery they are now fallen into.</P>
<P>AS the Evil is laid at your Door, &s;o the Remedy is in your Hands; for if you are the Cau&s;e, you may certainly be the Cure. May Heaven dictate to you, how, being the original Spring of all our Misfortunes, you are under an effectual Obligation to endeavour the redre&s;&s;ing this Grievance.</P>
<P>AS the general Wearing of Callicoes is the Complaint, the general Leaving them off will be the Cure; the Fa&s;hion is the Grievance, becau&s;e it is a Fa&s;hion; 'tis in the Ladies Power at once to make it odious and abhorr'd all over the King|dom: You are able to make it as much out of Fa&s;hion, as you brought it into Fa&s;hion at once: You gave it your Sanc|tion,
<PB N="17" REF="15">
by approving and e&s;pou&s;ing it, and you can &s;ink it again by the Bla&s;t of your Mouths.</P>
<P>Take the Honour of it, Madam, from the Men, give them nothing to boa&s;t of for reforming their Wives, but make their Wives triumph over them, by telling them, that you, whenever you plea&s;e, can di&s;tre&s;s them; and again, whenever you plea&s;e, remove their Grievance.</P>
<P>The Men can make no &s;uch Alteration, they cannot decry or oblige us to the Di&s;u&s;e of any Thing; but if you turn your Eyes this or that Way, you can rai&s;e or &s;uppre&s;s what you plea&s;e to the Publick Benefit of the Nation.</P>
<P>To what Purpo&s;e &s;hould we trouble our Repre&s;entatives with our Complaints? Ea&s;e us, Madam, your &s;elves of the Trou|ble. If the Women in <HI>England</HI> will but &s;et their Hands to this Work, not a Callicoe, not a Piece of Linnen printed or &s;tain'd &s;hall be &s;old, or worn in <HI>England:</HI> Then all our Petitions will be at an End, they that bid the People petition will bid them be ea&s;y, all the Manufactures of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hall revive, and the Women will have the Glory of having &s;aved the Nation.</P>
<P>We mo&s;t humbly put your Lady&s;hip in Mind how the Men in&s;ult us upon
<PB N="18" REF="16">
this Head; how they in&s;olently tell us, that tho' the Women may &s;ometimes do more Good than Hurt, they never had the Opportunity of doing more Hurt than Good but they were &s;ure to take hold of it.</P>
<P>And thus they conclude, that our De|liverance, <HI>to u&s;e their own Words,</HI> is out of Sight, becau&s;e it is in the Hands of the Women, who always did Hurt ra|ther than Good.</P>
<P>Contradict them, we be&s;eech your Lady&s;hip, in this Article, and let the whole Country be &s;aved by your Hand: All the Petitions then from the &s;everal Parts of the Kingdom &s;hall be remov'd, and we, the poor Country Manufactu|rers and Spinners, will pay our Ho|mage to you Ladies of <HI>London,</HI> and the Honour of Delivering the whole Fami|ly of the Spinners &s;hall be your own.</P>
<P>In order to this, the Prayer of our Peti|tion concludes to your Lady&s;hip, That you would be pleas'd to take the &s;ad and deplorable Condition of your poor Petitioners into your Con&s;ideration; and, in a Word, that you and all the Ladies of your Family, the Renowned Family of the <HI>Woollpacks,</HI> with all your Family and Servants, may, by your Order, lay a&s;ide your Callicoe Gowns
<PB N="19" REF="17">
and Petticoats of all Sorts, and de|clare publickly that none of you will any more be dre&s;s'd in them, whether we call Dre&s;&s;ing the Set-Dre&s;s for Abroad, or the Di&s;habil&egrave; for the Morn|ing, but that you wou'd rea&s;&s;ume tho&s;e many pretty Stuffs which are already Invented by our Weavers, or which may be Invented to plea&s;e the Fancy, in the room of the Callicoes; and your Petitioners, leaving all other Applica|tion, &s;hall for ever Pray for all Hap|pine&s;s to the Noble Family of the <HI>Woollpacks.</HI></P>
