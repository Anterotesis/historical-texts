<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE Granville Leve&s;on Gower, Earl Gower, Lord Chamberlain of his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following little comedy, found|ed on a &s;tory of M. Marmontelle's, and calculated to expo&s;e the frivolity and ignorance of the pretenders to learn|ing, with the in&s;olence and vanity of their &s;uperficial, illiberal protectors, can be ad|dre&s;&s;ed to no nobleman with more propri|ety than to Lord Gower; who&s;e judgment, though elegant, is void of affectation; and who&s;e patronage, though powerful, is de|&s;titute of all fa&s;tidious parade. It is with plea&s;ure, my Lord, that the public &s;ees your Lord&s;hip plac'd at the head of that depart|ment which is to decide, without appeal,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
on the mo&s;t popular domain in the whole republic of letters; a &s;pot that has always been di&s;tingui&s;h'd with affection, and cul|tivated with care, by every ruler the lea&s;t attentive to either cha&s;ti&s;ing the morals, poli&s;hing the manners, or what is of equal importance, rationally amu&s;ing the lei&s;ure of the people.</P>
<P>The Patron, my Lord, who now begs your protection, has had the good fortune to be well receiv'd by the public; and in|deed, of all the pieces that I have had the honour to offer them, this &s;eems to me to have the faire&s;t claim to their favour.</P>
<P>But the play, &s;tripped of tho&s;e theatrical ornaments for which it is indebted to your Lord&s;hip's indulgence, mu&s;t now plead it's own cau&s;e; nor will I, my Lord, with an affected humility, echo the trite, coar&s;e, though cla&s;&s;ical compliment, of Optimus patronus pe&s;&s;imus poeta: For if this be really true of the la&s;t, the fir&s;t can have but &s;mall preten&s;ions to prai&s;e; patronizing bad poets being, in my poor opinion, full as pernicious to the progre&s;s of letters, as neglecting the good.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">In humble hopes, then, my Lord, of not being thought the meane&s;t in the mu&s;es train, I have taken the liberty to prefix your name to this dedication, and publickly to acknowlege my obligations to your lord&s;hip; which, let me boa&s;t too, I have had the happine&s;s to receive, untaint|ed by the in&s;olence of dome&s;tics, the de|lays of office, or the chilling &s;uperiority of rank; mortifications which have been too often experienced by much greater writers than my&s;elf, from much le&s;s men than your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>My Lord, I have the honour to be, with the greate&s;t re&s;pect and gratitude,</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delicate! Palling, nau&s;eous, to a dread|ful degree. To a lover, indeed, the charms of the niece may palliate the uncle's ful|&s;ome formality.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, you know, there's Juliet's uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir Thomas Lofty! the modern Midas, or rather (as fifty dedications will
<PB N="3" REF="8">
tell you) the Pollio, the Atticus, the pa|tron of genius, the protector of arts, the paragon of poets, decider on merit, chief ju&s;tice of ta&s;te, and &s;worn apprai&s;er to Apollo and the tuneful nine. Ha, ha. Oh, the tedious, in&s;ipid, in&s;ufferable coxcomb!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now, Frank, you are too extrava|gant. He is univer&s;ally allow'd to have ta&s;te; &s;harp-judging Adriel, the mu&s;e's friend, him&s;elf a mu&s;e.</P>

Look ye, Dick, what raptures you plea&s;e, when Mi&s;s Lofty is your theme, but expect no quarter for the re&s;t of the family. I tell thee once for all, Lofty is a rank impo&s;tor, the bufo of an illiberal mer|cenary tribe; he has neither genius to cre|ate, judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h, or genero&s;ity to reward; his wealth has gain'd him flat|tery from the indigent, and the haughty in&s;olence of his pretence, admiration from the ignorant.

<P>Rival! what, Ru&s;t? why &s;he's too mo|dern for him by a couple of centuries. Martin! why he likes no heads but upon coins. Marry'd! the mummy! Why 'tis not above a fortnight ago that I &s;aw him making love to the figure without a no&s;e, in Somer&s;et-Gardens: I caught him &s;troak|ing the marble plaits of her gown, and a&s;ked him if he was not a&s;hamed to take &s;uch liberties with ladies in public.</P>

<P>Oh, a Dorimant. But how came this about? what could occa&s;ion the change? was it in the power of fle&s;h and blood to &s;educe this adorer of virt&ugrave; from his marble and porphyry?</P>

<P>Juliet met him la&s;t week at her uncle's: he was a little plea&s;ed with the Greek of her profile; but on a clo&s;er enquiry, he found the turn-up of her no&s;e too exactly re&s;emble the bu&s;t of the prince&s;s Popaea.</P>

<P>Ay, this country has &s;poil'd them; this &s;ame chri&s;tening will ruin the colonies.&mdash; Well, dear Bever, rare news, boy; our fleet is arriv'd from the We&s;t.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, lad; and a glorious cargo of tur|tle. It was lucky I went to Brighthelm|&s;tone; I nick'd the time to a hair; thin as

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is amazing how this country im|proves in turtle and turnpikes; to which (give me leave to &s;ay) we, from our part of the world, have not a little contributed. Why formerly, Sir, a brace of bucks on the mayor's annual day was thought a pretty moderate ble&s;&s;ing. But we, Sir, have poli&s;h'd their palates: Why, Sir, not the meane&s;t member of my corporation but can di&s;tingui&s;h the pa&s;h from the pee.</P>

<P>Why, then, Mr. Dactyl, carry them to &s;omebody el&s;e; there are people enough in the trade; but I wonder you would med|dle with poetry; you know it rarely pays for the paper.</P>

<P>Why, let him give them warning as &s;oon as he can. A pretty &s;ort of &s;ervice, indeed! where there are neither wages nor vails. The mu&s;es! And what, I &s;uppo&s;e this is the livery they give. Gadzooks, I had rather be a waiter at Ranelagh.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>As Gad &s;hall judge me, Mr. Bever, as pretty a poem, and &s;o polite; not a mortal can take any offence; all full of panegyric and prai&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine character he gives of his works. No offence! the greate&s;t in the world, Mr. Dactyl. Panegyric and prai&s;e! and what will that do with the publick? why who the devil will give money to be told, that Mr. Such-a-one is a wi&s;er or better man than him&s;elf? no, no; 'tis quite and clean out of nature. A good &s;ou&s;ing &s;atire now, well powder'd with per&s;onal pepper, and &s;ea&s;on'd with the &s;pirit of party; that de|moli&s;hes a con&s;picuous character, and &s;inks him below our own level; there, there, we are pleas'd; there we chuckle, and grin, and to&s;s the half-crowns on the counter.</P>

<P>For my part, I don't know much of the&s;e matters; but a couple of gentlemen near me, who &s;eem'd &s;agacious enough too, declar'd that it was the vile&s;t &s;tuff they ever had heard, and wonder'd the players would act it.</P>

<P>Think, Mr. Bever! I think the public are blockheads; a ta&s;tele&s;s, &s;tupid, ignorant tribe; and a man of genius de&s;erves to be damn'd who writes any thing for them.

<P>No, Sir Thomas, no. I &s;hall neither flat|ter you nor my&s;elf; I have acquir'd a right to &s;peak what I think. Your play, Sir, is a wretched performance; and in this opinion all mankind are united.</P>
