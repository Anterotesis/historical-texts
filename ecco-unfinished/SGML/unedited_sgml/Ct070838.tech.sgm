<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IN a Nation rais'd as we are by
Trade, fam'd for carrying on the
mo&s;t extended Commerce in the
World, and particularly pro&s;pe|rous
in the greate&s;t &V;nderta|kings,
whether for Improvement at Home,
or Adventure Abroad, nothing is more
wonderful, than to &s;ee how ignorant the
Generality of our People are about it;
how weakly they talk of it, and how little
has been made publick for their better In|formation.</P>
<P>Every Man knows his own Affairs, moves
in his own Circle, pur&s;ues the Mechani&s;m
of his own particular Bu&s;ine&s;s; but take
him out of his Road, he knows nothing
of the Rea&s;on, or the End of what he is
about: The Clothier &s;orts his Wool, dyes
and mixes the Colours; the Comb, the Card,
the Wheel, the Loom, are all &s;et on Work
by his Direction, and he is call'd a <HI>Ma&s;ter
of his Art,</HI> and he is &s;o; but ask him where
<PB REF="3">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
his Cloths are &s;old, by whom bought, to what
Part of the World they are &s;hipt, and who are
the la&s;t Con&s;umers of them, he knows nothing
of the Matter; he &s;ends them up to <HI>London</HI>
to the Factor that &s;ells them, whether at
<HI>Blackwell-Hall,</HI> or in his private Ware|hou&s;e,
and when &s;old, he draws Bills for the
Money; there his Circle meets; the Money
buys more Wool to be &s;orted, and comb'd, and
&s;pun; and &s;o on, he ends ju&s;t where he be|gins,
and he begins ju&s;t where he ended.
To talk to him of Trade, Ships, Ex|portation;
Markets Abroad, and Returns
in Specie, or in Merchants Goods, tis
as much out of his Way, as the Race
and the Paddock is to a Carryer's Pack|hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Merchant on the other Hand
moves in another Sphere; and he being
a Man of Corre&s;pondence, be&s;ides his
own Adventure, receives Commi&s;&s;ions from
Abroad to buy &s;uch and &s;uch Goods, and
good Remittances by Bills to pay for them,
then he &s;hips them according to Order,
&s;ends his Invoyces and Bills of Loading by
the Po&s;t; and there's his Circle fini&s;h'd. As
to the Wool which is the Principal of the
Manufacture; as to the many Hands it goes
thro'; how many Thou&s;and Families are
employed by it; how the Poor are &s;ub&s;i&s;ted,
the Provi&s;ions con&s;um'd, the landed In|tere&s;t
rais'd, the Nobility and Gentry
enrich'd, and the whole Nation &s;upported
<PB N="v" REF="5">
by the very Goods he buys; he neither
knows or concerns him&s;elf about it.</P>
<P>The Captains, Ma&s;ters, Owners, and
Navigators of Ships, they move in another
Orb, but &s;till act in the &s;ame Round of
Bu&s;ine&s;s; the Ship is built, and fitted out
for a Voyage; Thou&s;ands of Trade&s;men and
Workmen &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the petty Demands
of the Captain or other Per&s;ons who direct the
Voyage; the Timber, the Plank, the Iron-Work,
the Ma&s;ts, the Rigging, the Tar
and Hemp, the Flax and Oyl, all pa&s;s
thro' different and numberle&s;s Hands, till
they center in the Builder's Yard; there
the Frame of a Ve&s;&s;el is &s;et on the Stocks.
What Hands are then employ'd to creat the
beautiful u&s;eful Form of a Ship! and
what Art to perfect and launch her into the
Water!</P>
<P>The Carpenters, Caulkers, Ma&s;tmakers,
Joyners, Carvers, Painters, Smiths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
fini&s;h the Hull; the Trade&s;men are employ'd
to furni&s;h and fit her out; the Sail-Ma|kers,
the Rope-Makers, Anchor-Smiths,
Block- Makers, Guu-Founders, Coopers, and
(for a Thou&s;and &s;mall Things too trifling to
mention, tho' ab&s;olutely needful) the Ship
Chandler, and at la&s;t the Brewer, Butcher,
Baker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Provi&s;ion to victual her,
all help on the Voyage.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;upported by that glorious Head
of Commerce, called the <HI>Merchant,</HI> are em|ployed
in the Out&s;et of the Ship, but know
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
nothing how to manage the Ship in the Ocean,
how to cau&s;e her to find her Way on the wild
and pathle&s;s Surface of the Water; they fit
her out, and deliver all to the Commander,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as to the &s;ailing Part, that belongs
to another Cla&s;s of People, called the Sailers
or Navigators; and when the Trade&s;men
have put the Ship into their Hands, their
Work is done, till the Ship returns, and then
they begin all again: So the Circle is conti|nued,
for ever the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Again, the Navigator or Commander, he
puts up his Ship on the Exchange for &s;uch a
Voyage, <HI>Lisbon,</HI> or <HI>Cadiz,</HI> or <HI>Hamburg,</HI> or
<HI>Leghorn;</HI> he takes in the Merchants
Goods, carries them &s;afe to the delivering
Port; he reloads there, and brings back
his Cargoe; he knows no more; even his
<HI>Bills of Loading</HI> are &s;ign'd, under a needful
Profe&s;&s;ion of his Ignorance, naming the Bulk
of what he receives on Board (&s;o many
Hog&s;heads, or Butts, or Bales) but adds
<HI>the Contents unknown, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When he brings home the Ship, he makes
his Report at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and un|livers
his Cargo, as they call it; then he
receives his Freight, pays his Men, and
lays the Ship up, and there's his Circle fi|ni&s;h'd;
his Sphere of Action, however im|portant;
reaches no farther; as to Trade
or Commerce, whether general or parti|cular,
he knows no more of it than ju&s;t
lies before him.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">
I might run thro' almo&s;t all the Branches
of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and all the Cla&s;&s;es of the Men
of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and give Examples of the like;
but 'tis enough, the Conclu&s;ion is &s;hort:
Hence then a general or univer&s;al <HI>Plan of
Commerce</HI> is certainly much wanted in
the World.</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of &s;ome Men, who are
the mo&s;t acquainted in the World of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
we &s;ay they are Men of a general
Knowledge; and &s;uch a Man is an univer|&s;al
Merchant; I have indeed heard &s;uch
Language talked among the trading Part of
Mankind, but I cannot &s;ay that I ever &s;aw
the Man.</P>
<P>The Commerce of the World, e&s;pecially
as it is now carried on, is an unbounded
Ocean of Bu&s;ine&s;s; Trackle&s;s and unknown,
like the Seas it is managed upon; the Mer|chant
is no more to be follow'd in his Adven|tures,
than a Maze or Labyrinth is to be
trac'd out without a Clue.</P>
<P>The Author of this Work is not quite
&s;o arrogant, after a Complaint of this Na|ture,
as to tell you he &s;hall pre&s;ent you with
this univer&s;al Plan, for the whole Trade
of the World: It is enough, if he is able to
offer a Plan for the Trade of our own
Country, in which it is but too true, there
are many that talk of the general Com|merce
to one that under&s;tands it.</P>
<P>Nor even in this Plan of our Commerce,
does he direct what the Trade of <HI>Europe,</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
in general is with us; but what and how great
our particular Commerce is; how it is ar|riv'd
to its pre&s;ent Magnitude; how to
be maintained and &s;upported in its full Ex|tent;
(and which is, or ought to be, the
true End of all &s;uch Attempts:) How it
may yet be improv' d and enlarg'd.</P>
<P>We have loud Complaints among us of
the Decay of our Trade, the declining of
our Manufactures, and e&s;pecially of our
woollen Manufacture, the contrary of which
is, I think, evidently prov'd in this Tract,
and the Rea&s;ons given for it, will not be
ea&s;ily refuted. It is not any little Nega|tive
put upon our Manufactures, as to their
Con&s;umption in this or that petty Province
or Country in <HI>Germany,</HI> or el&s;e where:
Our Manufacture, like a flowing Tide, if
'tis bank't out in one Place, it &s;preads by
other Channels at the &s;ame Time into &s;o many
different Parrs of the World, and finds
every Day &s;o many new Outlets, that the
Ob&s;truction is not felt; but like the Land
to the Sea, what it lo&s;es in one Place, it
gains in another.</P>
<P>It is plain, the Manufacture cannot be de|clin'd,
if the Quantity of Wool is wrought
up, and the Goods are con&s;um'd; on the other
Hand 'tis evident, the Con&s;umption of our
Manufactures, both abroad and at home, is
exceedingly encreas'd; the fir&s;t by the En|crea&s;e
of our Corre&s;pondencies, and the la&s;t by
the Encrea&s;e of our People; and that to &s;uch
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
a Degree, as infinitely out-weighs all that
can be pretended of the Prohibitions of
them in <HI>Germany,</HI> or the Imitations of
them in <HI>France;</HI> nor are tho&s;e things able to
wound us &s;o deep as our phlegmatick Com|plainers
would in&s;inuate.</P>
<P>But that a full An&s;wer may be given
to all they can &s;ay of what Lo&s;s we yet &s;uf|fer,
and to all they can &s;ugge&s;t of what
we may &s;uffer hereafter; this Work is cal|culated,
to &s;hew how we may counteract
it all at once: Namely, by improving and
encrea&s;ing our Trade in other Places where
tho&s;e Prohibitions and Imitations cannot
reach, and where, if half <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould
drop our Manufacture, which yet 'tis ap|parent
can never happen, we &s;hall rai&s;e
an equivalent Vent for our Goods, and
make Markets of our own; in which the
whole World could not &s;upplant us, unle&s;s
they could &s;ubdue us.</P>
<P>This is the Sub&s;tance of this Tract;
'tis the original Thought which gave Birth
to the whole Work; if our Trade is the
Envy of the World, and they are con&s;pi|ring
to break in upon it, either to anti|cipate
it, or block it out, we are the more
engaged to look out for its Support; and
we have Room enough: The World is wide:
There are new Countries, and new Nati|ons,
who may be &s;o planted, &s;o improv'd,
and the People &s;o manag'd, as to create a
new Commerce; and Millions of People
<PB N="x" REF="10">
&s;hall call for our Manufacture, who ne|ver
call'd for it before.</P>
<P>Nothing is to me more evident, than that
the civilizing the Nations where we and
other <HI>Europeans</HI> are already &s;ettled; bring|ing
the naked Savages to Clothe, and in|&s;tructing
barbarous Nations how to live,
has had a vi&s;ible Effect already, in this
very Article. Tho&s;e Nations call upon us
every Year for more Goods, than they did
the Year before, as well woollen Manu|factures,
as others. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Colo|nies
in the <HI>Brazils,</HI> and on the Ea&s;t Coa&s;ts
of <HI>Africa,</HI> are an unan&s;werable Proof of
this. The <HI>European</HI> Manufactures now
&s;ent to tho&s;e Colonies, are above five Times
as many as were &s;ent to the &s;ame Places,
about 30 to 40 Years ago; and yet the
<HI>European</HI> Inhabitants in tho&s;e Colonies are
not encrea&s;ed in Proportion. We might
give In&s;tances of the like in other Places
abroad, and that not a few.</P>
<P>New planting Colonies then, and farther
improving tho&s;e already &s;ettled, will effec|tually
encrea&s;e this Improvement; for like
Cau&s;es, will have like Effects; Clothing
new Nations cannot fail of encrea&s;ing the
Demand of Goods, becau&s;e it encrea&s;es the
Con&s;umption, and that encrea&s;ed Demand
is the Pro&s;perity of our Trade.</P>
<P>Here then is an undi&s;cover'd Ocean of
Commerce laid open to us, and &s;ame Spe|cimens
are offer'd, which if entred upon,
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
with the Authority, Power, and Vigor of
the Publick, would open &s;uch new Chan|nels
of Trade among us, as it would be
very hard for our Manufacturers to over|&s;tock
the Market, and as no petty Prohi|bitions
in Europe could &s;top the Current of.</P>
<P>It is &s;urprizing that in a Nation where
&s;uch Encouragements are given for planting
and improving, where Colonies have been
&s;ettled, and Plantations made with &s;uch
Succe&s;s; where we may truly be &s;aid to
have filled the World with the Wonders of
our growing Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and where we have
added not Provinces only, but Kingdoms to
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominion, and have launched
out even to an Ocean of Commerce. That
now, I &s;ay, We &s;hould, as it were, put a
full Stop at once to all our great De&s;igns;
check the Humour of Encrea&s;ing, and from
a kind of a my&s;terious unaccountable Stupi|dity
turn indolent on a &s;uddain. Not as if
we found no were Room to launch out, for
the Contrary to that is apparent; but as
if we had enough, and &s;ought no more
Worlds in Trade to conquer.</P>
<P>In all other Ca&s;es, and among all other
Nations Succe&s;s encourages Men to go on;
encrea&s;ing, they endeavour to encrea&s;e, <HI>Cre&s;|cit
amor nummi,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;So in Trade, the
growing and enlarging the Bounds of a Plan|tation,
the &s;welling and thriving of Com|merce,
and the Advantages to the Mer|chant
and Planter in all tho&s;e Things, cer|tainly

encrea&s;es the De&s;ire of planting, en|larges
the Commerce and fires the Mer|chant
with the De&s;ires of enlarging his Ad|ventures,
&s;earching out new Colonies, form|ing
new Adventures, and pu&s;hing at new
Di&s;coveries for the Encrea&s;e of his Trad|ing
Advantages.</P>
<P>It is &s;o in other Nations, and it &s;eems
wonderful it &s;hould not be &s;o here; the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> tho' an indolent Nation, who&s;e
Colonies were really &s;o rich, &s;o great,
and &s;o far extended, as were enough even
to glut their utmo&s;t Avarice; yet gave not
over, till, as it were, they &s;at &s;till, becau&s;e
they had no more Worlds to look for; or till
at lea&s;t, there were no more Gold or Sil|ver
Mines to di&s;cover</P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> tho' an effeminate, haugh|ty,
and as it were, a decay'd Nation in
Trade; yet how do they go on Daily encrea|&s;ing
their Colonies in the <HI>Brazils,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI>
as well on the Ea&s;t Side, as the We&s;t? And
how do they encrea&s;e their Commerce in all
tho&s;e Countries, by reducing the numerous
Natious in <HI>Melinda,</HI> in <HI>Zanguebar,</HI> in <HI>Con|go,</HI>
in <HI>Angola,</HI> in the <HI>Brazils,</HI> as well North
as South, and every where el&s;e, to the
Chri&s;tian Oeconomy, and to the Government
of Commerce! by which they &s;ubdue whole
Nations of Savages to a regular Life, and
by that Means bring them to be &s;ub&s;ervient
to Trade as well as to Government.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="15">
But how little have we done of this kind?
How little have we gain'd upon the Na|tives
of <HI>America</HI> in all our Colonies? How
few of them are brought to live among us,
how few to be &s;ubject to us? How little
Progre&s;s of that kind can we boa&s;t of? All
our Colonies &s;eem to be carried on upon the
meer Strength of our own People. Nor can
we &s;ay we have any one con&s;iderable Nation
reduced to entire Obedience and brought to
live under the Regularity and Direction of a
Civil Government, in all our Plantations;
a few (very few) in <HI>New England</HI> only
excepted.</P>
<P>As for new Colonies and Conque&s;ts, how
do we &s;eem entirely to give over, even the
Thoughts of them, tho' the Scene is &s;o large,
tho' the Variety is &s;o great, and the Ad|vantages
&s;o many? On the Contrary, we
&s;eem to forget the glorious Improvements of
our Ance&s;tors, &s;uch as the great <HI>Drake, Ca|vendi&s;h,
Smith, Greenfield, Somers,</HI> and a|bove
all, the yet greater Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI>
upon the Foot of who&s;e Genius almo&s;t all the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Di&s;coveries were made, and all the
Colonies and Plantations, which now form
what they call the <HI>Engli&s;h Empire</HI> in <HI>Ame|rica</HI>
were &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed. The&s;e I
&s;ay we &s;eem to &s;it down with, as if we
had done our utmo&s;t, were fully &s;atisfied
with what we have, that the enterpri|&s;ing
Genius was buried with the old Di&s;|coverers,
and there was neither Room in the
<PB N="xiv" REF="16">
World or Inclination in our People to look
any farther.</P>
<P>Whereas on the Contrary, the World pre|&s;ents
us with large Scenes of Trade, new
Platforms for Bu&s;ine&s;s, enough to prompt
our Ambition, and even to glut our Ava|rice;
yet we &s;eem to have no Heart for the
Adventure.</P>
<P>Nor is there any want of People among
us; on the contrary, here are Thou&s;ands of
Families who want Bu&s;ine&s;s, want Employ|ment,
want Encouragement, and many that
want no Stocks to carry with them, and are
ready to go abroad, were the adventuring
Spirit reviv'd, and &s;ome Men fired with
Warmth for the &V;ndertaking, and but vi|gorous
enough to make the Beginning.</P>
<P>This is the Way to rai&s;e new Worlds of
Commerce, to enlarge and extend new Funds
of Trade, to open Doors for an Encrea&s;e
of Shipping and Manufacture; the Places
are &s;o many and the Advantages &s;o great
for the making &s;uch Attempts; that I &s;ay
nothing is more wonderful of its kind,
than to &s;ee how backward we are to pu&s;h
on our own Advantages, and to plant in
the mo&s;t agreeable Climates in the World,
in a manner &s;o advantageous as never to
be &s;upplanted, and &s;uch as &s;hould make
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions abroad five Times as
Great, as Opulent and as $Profitable to Old
<HI>England,</HI> as they have been yet.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="17">
The De&s;cription of the&s;e Places, &s;o pro|per
for Planting, &s;o &s;uited to Commerce,
and &s;o qualified to enrich and aggran|dize
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, is a Work not only
too large for this Tract, but &s;eems not &s;uited
to our pre&s;ent Ta&s;t; it mu&s;t lye till the
Trading Genius revives and the adventur|ing
Temper is re&s;tored among us: Then it
will appear; there will neither want En|couragment
to &s;uch &V;ndertakings or &V;nder|takers
to embrace the Encouragements which
offer.</P>
<P>As the&s;e are Things of the utmo&s;t Im|portance
to our Trade in general, and in
that to the Pro&s;perity of all his Maje&s;ty's
Dominions in particular, the Author hum|bly
hopes it &s;hall not be thought a&s;&s;uming,
that as we &s;ay in our Title, they are hum|bly
referr'd to the Con&s;ideration of the
King and Parliament; they are Things
worthy of a King, and worthy of a power|ful
Legi&s;lature to con&s;ider of; no Power
le&s;s than that of King; Lords and Com|mons,
can put the&s;e Wheels of Improvement
into due Motion: And I conclude with
an inexpre&s;&s;ible Satisfaction, in &s;aying, that
as we know his Maje&s;ty has the Pro&s;pe|rity
of all his Kingdoms at Heart, and will
be always ready to $word$ to rea&s;onable and
practicable Propo&s;als for that Purpo&s;e;
and that the Parliament has always &s;hewn
their Readine&s;s to concur in the &s;ame ju&s;t
<PB N="xvi" REF="18">
Endeavour; and which is yet more, that
the Propo&s;als here offered, and others yet
behind, are apparently practicable and ra|tional;
it cannot be doubted, but that the
Time will come, and is near at Hand,
when the Improvement of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Com|merce
&s;hall no more appear in Project and
Theory, but &s;hew it &s;elf in a due and
daily Progre&s;&s;ion, till it compleats the Glo|ry
and Pro&s;perity of the whole Nation.</P>

<HEAD>OF

IN
GENERAL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>_TRADE, like Religion, is
what every Body talks of,
but few under&s;tand: The ve|ry
Term is dubious, and in
its ordinary Acceptation, not
&s;ufficiently explain'd.</P>
<P>WHEN 'tis particular to a Place, 'tis
<HI>Trade;</HI> when general, 'tis <HI>Commerce;</HI>
when we &s;peak of it as the Effect of Na|ture,
'tis <HI>Product</HI> or Produce; when as
the Effect of Labour, 'tis <HI>Manufacture:</HI> In
its Management 'tis the &s;ame, for when we
<PB N="2" REF="30">
&s;peak of it in the gro&s;s, 'tis <HI>whole&s;ale;</HI>
when of the particulars, 'tis <HI>retale;</HI> when
we &s;peak of Nations, 'tis call'd <HI>Corre&s;pond|ing;</HI>
when of foreign Import only, 'tis cal|led
<HI>Merchandizing;</HI> 'Tis the &s;ame al&s;o in
the Manner, when we exchange Goods 'tis
call'd <HI>Barter;</HI> when we exchange Coin,
'tis call'd <HI>Banking, Negoce</HI> and <HI>Nego|tiating;</HI>
Hence, our Money - Gold&s;miths
were formerly called <HI>Bankers,</HI> and our great
national Trea&s;ury of Commerce is at this
Day called the <HI>Bank.</HI></P>
<P>THE general heads of Home-Trade are be&s;t
contain'd in the <HI>two</HI> plain and homely Terms
<HI>Labouring,</HI> and <HI>Dealing.</HI> 1&s;t. <HI>The labouring
Part,</HI> this con&s;i&s;ts of Arts, Handicrafts, and
all Kinds of Manufactures; and tho&s;e who
are employ'd in the&s;e Works, are properly
called <HI>Mechanicks;</HI> they are employ'd, gene|rally
&s;peaking, about the fir&s;t Principles of
Trade, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Product of the <HI>Land</HI> or
of the <HI>Sea,</HI> or of the Animals living on
both: In a Word, the ordinary Produce of
the <HI>vegetative</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;ative Life;</HI> &s;uch as
Metals, Minerals and Plants, the imme|diate
Produce of <HI>Vegetation,</HI> or &s;uch as
Fle&s;h, Skins, Hair, Wool, Silk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> grown
with, and produc'd by the Animals, as the
Effect of <HI>&s;en&s;itive Life.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>The Dealing Part;</HI> this con&s;i&s;ts of hand|ing
about all the &s;everal Productions of Art
and Labour, when fini&s;h'd by the Hand
of the indu&s;trious Mechanick, and made
<PB N="3" REF="31">
u&s;eful to Mankind; conveying them from
Place to Place, and from one Country to
another, as the Nece&s;&s;ity and the Conve|nience
of the People call for them; and
that upon &s;uch Terms and Conditions of
Delivery, as they can be&s;t agree about a|mong
them&s;elves, and this is Trade; whe|ther
it be carry'd on by the general Medium
of all Exchangings call'd Coin, or by &s;ome|thing
&s;ub&s;tituted as Coin, and in the room
of it, which we call Money.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> ANY Thing that is by the Autho|rity
of a Nation e&s;tabli&s;h'd as the Me|dium
of their Exchanges, is properly
the MONEY of the Nation, tho' &s;eldom
any Thing but Gold, Silver, or other
Metals is call'd COIN.</P>
<P>THUS Dealing and Manufacturing com|prehends
all Trade; that is to &s;ay, in its
meer natural and original Situation; and
all the &s;ub&s;equent Divi&s;ions and Di&s;tincti|ons
of Terms, by which we are taught to
expre&s;s the particular Parts of Trade, are
but modern Names introduc'd by Cu&s;tom,
and legitimated by length of Time, and
general U&s;age of the Men of Art, to di|&s;tingui&s;h
Things, as accident and the Va|riety
of the &s;everal Productions in Mecha|ni&s;m
required.</P>
<P>SO the Word GOODS is a general Term,
comprehending all the &s;everal Kinds and
Sorts, whether of Manufactures or Pro|duct,
that the greate&s;t Dealer in the World
<PB N="4" REF="32">
can be &s;uppo&s;ed to Trade in; it is a u&s;u|al
Thing to expre&s;s it &s;o to this Day, in
the Language of Trade; <HI>for Example,</HI> in
<HI>retailing,</HI> we &s;ay, &s;uch a Shop is well fur|ni&s;h'd
with all Sorts of GOODS: In <HI>whole|&s;ale</HI>
Trade, &s;uch a Dealer has his Ware|hou&s;e
well fill'd with GOODS; In <HI>Hou&s;e|keeping,</HI>
all the Furniture of a Hou&s;e are
called the GOODS, or the <HI>Hou&s;hold-goods:</HI> In
<HI>Merchandizing,</HI> &s;uch a Ship was Loaden
with BALE GOODS; and in the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI>
Ships, after the <HI>bulky Goods,</HI> (&s;o they call
the Pepper, Salt-petre, Red-earth, Tea,
and &s;uch like) are taken out, it is &s;aid the
re&s;t of the Loading was made up with
PIECE GOODS.</P>
<P>AS the Terms in Trade are various, &s;o
the People concern'd in Trade bear differing
Titles, and are ordinarily known by differ|ing
Denominations.</P>
<P>THOSE concern'd in the meaner and fir&s;t
Employments, are called in common, Work|ing
Men or Labourers, and the <HI>labouring
Poor;</HI> &s;uch as the meer Husbandmen, Mi|ners,
Diggers, Fi&s;hers, and in &s;hort, all
the Drudges and Labourers in the &s;everal
Productions of Nature or of Art: <HI>Next
to them,</HI> are tho&s;e who, tho' labouring per|haps
equally with the other, have yet &s;ome
Art mingled with their Indu&s;try, and are
to be particularly in&s;tructed and taught
how to perform their Part, and tho&s;e are
called Workmen or Handicrafts.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="33">
SUPERIOR to the&s;e, are the Guides or Ma&s;|ters
in &s;uch Works or Employments, and
the&s;e are call'd Arti&s;ts, Mechanicks or Crafts|men;
and in general, all are under&s;tood in
this one Word Mechanicks; &s;uch are Clo|thiers,
Weavers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Handicrafts in Hard|ware,
Bra&s;s, Iron, Steel, Copper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SUPERIOR to the&s;e are the Dealers who
only buy and &s;ell, either by whole&s;ale or
retale as above; the&s;e are the Factor, the
Pedlar, and the Merchant.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e come under the general Deno|mination
of Trading Men, and they are the
principal Kinds or Profe&s;&s;ions which <HI>ju&s;t
now</HI> carry on the Trade of the World.</P>
<P>HAVING thus, once for all, accounted for
the&s;e &s;everal Di&s;tinctions, and for the tra|ding
People in their re&s;pective Denomina|tions
as above, we &s;hall have no more Oc|ca&s;ion
to explain the Terms as we go a|long,
or trouble the Reader witli running
out to enquire our Meaning, when we
&s;peak of the &s;everal Branches of <HI>Commerce</HI>
in their proper and particular Di&s;tinctions
or Terms of Art.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t al&s;o remove &s;ome Scandal out
of the Way as we go on, and this is ano|ther
Difficulty. This Scandal relates to the
Dignity, Antiquity, and other Honours
due to Trade, and claim'd in its Behalf;
concerning which we meet with much
weak headed Strife in the World; and
which, as I take it, belongs properly to
<PB N="6" REF="34">
this Place, at lea&s;t I &s;hall di&s;charge my &s;elf
of it here, and by doing &s;o, &s;hall have no
more Occa&s;ion to trouble you with it in the
re&s;t of our Debate, however, the imper|tinent
Cavils of the Times may importune
me upon that Head.</P>
<P>PRIDE, in Conjunction with abundance
of Ignorance, is frequently in Arms again&s;t
the peaceable trading World about Pre|cedence,
and in a Plea of Antiquity: They
would divide the World into two Parts
only, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Gentry and the Commo|nalty;
among the Gentry they rank the
Nobility, the ancient Families of Gentle|men,
(as they call them) Barons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
tho&s;e who were formerly called Barons;
and with &s;ome Difficulty they admit the
Men of Learning, and the Men of Arms,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the Soldiery and the Clergy, and
all the Families, who by the Heraldry of
their Hou&s;es claim to have been Gentle|men
unmix'd with plebeian Blood for im|memorial
Ages.</P>
<P>THIS Family Jargon, <HI>for it is no more,</HI>
they oppo&s;e to the trading Part of the whole
World, whom they dive&s;t of all Dignity, as
well as of Degree; and blend together un|der
one general, or rather common De|nomination
of <HI>Mechanicks;</HI> tho' by the Acci|dents
of Time, and Circum&s;tances of Things,
&s;ome of them <HI>are,</HI> and for many Ages
<HI>have been</HI> true Members of the Gentry
by collateral Branches; nay &s;ometimes by
<PB N="7" REF="35">
the chief Lines of the be&s;t and mo&s;t an|cient
Families in the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> OBSERVE, here I &s;peak of our own
Country chiefly, and of the Mi&s;take,
as it is particularly e&s;pou&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI>
and nowhere el&s;e.</P>
<P>FIRST, as to Antiquity; and <HI>even in
this,</HI> I think the Trade&s;men and the Gentry
&s;hould never cap Pedigrees, &s;ince the mo&s;t
noble De&s;cendants of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Family, and
in whom the Primogeniture remained, were
really <HI>Mechanicks;</HI> for hone&s;t JUBAL and
TUBAL were the fir&s;t <HI>Fidle</HI>-makers and
<HI>Tinkers</HI> in the World: The fir&s;t invented
and made mu&s;ical In&s;truments, <HI>Fidles,</HI>
&amp;c. and the &s;econd was the fir&s;t <HI>Hard-ware
Manufacturer,</HI> that is in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a <HI>Tinker,</HI>
and no better; <HI>N. B.</HI> for long, (many long
Ages) after them, the Sons and Grand&s;ons
of the&s;e Mechanicks were Kings and Princes,
Dukes and Lords.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;econd Peopling of the
World, before there were any Di&s;tinctions
of Nobility, or Mechanicks, they &s;eem
to have been all$ Labourers; as at the
erecting that &s;tupendous Work called <HI>Ba|bel</HI>
for Example; to be &s;ure, the FREE-Ma&s;ons
and their Brother Bricklayers, who
were the Ma&s;ter-Builders there, were &s;ome
of the top of their Gentry at that Time.</P>
<P>AS the World encrea&s;ed, SIDON, <HI>No|ah</HI>'s
Grand&s;on, built a City, which remains
<PB N="8" REF="36">
in the &s;ame Place, and bears the &s;ame
Name to this Day.</P>
<P>HERE Navigation began, and as <HI>Noah</HI>
was the fir&s;t Shipwright, or according to
us, the fir&s;t <HI>Ship-Carpenter,</HI> (a true Me|chanick)
his Po&s;terity built the fir&s;t Boats,
and afterwards Ships at this Place; with
the&s;e they traded to and with the neigh|bouring
Nations upon the Coa&s;t, as Nature,
Rea&s;on and Nece&s;&s;ity guided them. In
the Infancy of their navigating Skill, they
Row'd along in the&s;e Boats, (for at fir&s;t they
had no Sails) from Place to Place North|ward,
to the Gulph of <HI>Alexandria</HI> now
<HI>Scandaroon,</HI> and &s;o on to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cilicia</HI>
where they built <HI>Tar&s;hi&s;h,</HI> the fir&s;t grand
<HI>Ar&s;enal</HI> or Place for Ship-building in the
World; whence great Ships were after|wards
called <HI>Ships of Tar&s;hi&s;h</HI> for many
Ages, no Ships of Burthen being built any
where el&s;e.</P>
<P>ALSO South they coa&s;ted to <HI>Joppa,</HI> now
<HI>Jaffa,</HI> thence to <HI>Damiata</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI>
where their great Grandfather CHAM reign|ed
Emperor of all <HI>Africa</HI> for many Ages.
See Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the
World.</P>
<P>ENCREASING thus in People, and in
Wealth (by Trade) and growing too great
for the Compa&s;s of one City, or the Com|merce
of one Port, they &s;pread them&s;elves
by way of Colony, and &s;ettled fir&s;t at
<HI>Tyre,</HI> a convenient Situation al&s;o for Ship|ing
and for Merchandizing.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="37">
HERE they encrea&s;ed again to &s;uch a Pro|digy
of Bu&s;ine&s;s, as I have good Rea&s;on to
believe, was never equall'd in the World,
except ju&s;t now, (<HI>viz.</HI>) by the great Trade
carry'd on at this Time in <HI>England;</HI> of
which in its Place.</P>
<P>AND here to prove to you beyond the
Power of Cavil, that the Antients thought
it not below their Quality to be Trade&s;|men;
the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Thy wi&s;e
Men were thy Pilots, and thy Merchants
are Princes;</HI> or as &s;ome read it, <HI>Thy Prin|ces
are Merchants,</HI> as it is expre&s;ly in ano|ther
Place, <HI>Ezekiel</HI> xxvii. 21. <HI>The Princes
of</HI> Kedar <HI>were thy Merchants.</HI></P>
<P>THUS much is &s;ufficient for the Antiqui|ty
of Trade and Navigation; as to the An|tiquity
of trading Families, I &s;ay with a
late low born Poet, but a Man of Wit,
<Q>Let <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> or <HI>Na&s;&s;au</HI> go higher.</Q>
And why then are we to de&s;pi&s;e Commerce
as a Mechani&s;m, and the Trading World
as mean, when the Wealth of the World is
deem'd to ri&s;e from Trade? as the &s;ame Text
&s;aid of <HI>Tyre,</HI> v. 33. of the &s;ame Chapter, <HI>Thou
did&s;t enrich the Kings of the Earth with
thy Merchandi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to bring this down to our &s;elves;
Are we a rich, a populous, a powerful Na|tion,
and in &s;ome Re&s;pects the greate&s;t in
all tho&s;e particulars in the World, and do
<PB N="10" REF="38">
we not boa&s;t of being &s;o? 'Tis evident it
was all deriv'd from Trade. <HI>Our Merchants
are Princes,</HI> greater and richer, and more
powerful than &s;ome &s;overeign Princes; and
in a Word, as is &s;aid of <HI>Tyre,</HI> we have
<HI>made the Kings of the Earth rich with our
Merchandi&s;e,</HI> that is, with our Trade.</P>
<P>IF U&s;efulne&s;s gives an Addition to the
Character, either of Men or Things, as
without doubt it does; Trading-men will
have the Preference in almo&s;t all the Di&s;putes
you can bring: There is not a Nation in
the known World, but have ta&s;ted the Be|nefit,
and owe their Pro&s;perity to the u&s;e|ful
Improvements of Commerce: Even the
&s;elf-vain Gentry, that would decry Trade
as a universal Mechani&s;m, are they not eve|ry
where depending upon it for their mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary Supplies? If they do not all <HI>&s;ell,</HI>
they are all forc'd to <HI>buy,</HI> and &s;o are a kind of
Traders them&s;elves, at lea&s;t they recognize
the U&s;efulne&s;s of Commerce, as what they
are not able to live comfortably without.</P>
<P>NAY, in many Parts of <HI>Britain,</HI> they
are really Traders, both Buyers and Sellers;
<HI>for Example,</HI> where the Landlords are
obliged to take their Rents in kind, as the
Clergy do their Tithes; here they are (in
a word) general Traders; they &s;ell their
Barley to the Malt-makers, their Wheat to
the Millers and Bakers, their Oates to the
Corn-factors, their Sheep and Bullocks are
&s;old at the Markets to the Butchers, or
<PB N="11" REF="39">
at Fairs to the Graziers; they are Sheep-Shearers,
and &s;ell their Wool to the Stapler
or Clothier; and when they kill a Bullock,
or a Calf, or a Sheep, for their Family-U&s;e,
they are beholding to the Felmonger,
and the Tanner, to buy the raw Hides
and Skins; when they &s;ell their Timber,
they are oblig'd to turn Mechanicks, and
&s;ell the Bark to the Tanners, the Timber
to the Ship-wright and the Carpenters, the
Bru&s;hwood and Bavins to the Baker and
the Brick-maker.</P>
<P>IN a Word, u&s;eful Trade &s;upports the
Gentleman; and without the&s;e Mechanicks
he could not di&s;po&s;e the Produce of his
E&s;tate, or make any Rent of his Land; and
rather than not di&s;po&s;e of it, &s;uch is his Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
that we &s;ee he will &s;toop to buy and
&s;ell for him&s;elf, and trade and deal like a
meer Mechanick.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all, if they would look a
little nearer, they would &s;ee them&s;elves not
by Practice only degenerated into Trad|ing
Men, but even their Fortunes, nay,
their very Blood mingled with the Mecha|nicks,
<HI>as they call them;</HI> the Nece&s;&s;ity of
their Circum&s;tances frequently reconciles the
be&s;t of the Nobility to the&s;e Mixtures; and
then the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity opens their Eyes
to the Ab&s;urdity of the Distinctions which
they had been &s;o wedded to before.</P>
<P>IT is with the utmo&s;t Di&s;grace to their
Under&s;tanding, that tho&s;e People would di|&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="12" REF="40">
them&s;elves in the Manner they
do, when they may certainly &s;ee every Day
pro&s;perous Circum&s;tances advance tho&s;e
Mechanicks, <HI>as they will have them cal|led,</HI>
into the Arms, and into the Rank
of the Gentry; and declining Fortunes re|duce
the be&s;t Families to a Level with the
Mechanick.</P>
<P>THE ri&s;ing Trade&s;man &s;wells into the
Gentry, and the declining Gentry &s;inks into
Trade. A Merchant, or perhaps a Man of
a meaner Employ thrives by his hone&s;t In|du&s;try,
Frugality, and a long &s;eries of dili|gent
Application to Bu&s;ine&s;s, and being
grown immen&s;ely rich, he marries his
Daughters to Gentlemen of the fir&s;t Quality,
perhaps a Coronet; then he leaves the Bulk
of his E&s;tate to his Heir, and he gets into
the Rank of the Peerage; does the next Age
make any Scruple of their Blood, being thus
mix'd with the antient Race? Do we not
ju&s;t now &s;ee two Dukes de&s;cended by the
Female Side, from the late Sir <HI>Jo&s;iah
Child,</HI> and the immediate Heir a Peer of
<HI>Ireland?</HI> Many Examples of the like Kind
might be given.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, the declining Gen|try,
in the Ebb of their Fortunes, frequent|ly
pu&s;h their Sons into Trade, and they a|gain,
by their Application, often re&s;tore the
Fortunes of their Families: Thus Trade&s;|men
become Gentlemen, by Gentlemen be|coming
Trade&s;men. I could give Exam|ples
<PB N="13" REF="41">
of this too, but they are too recent for
our naming.</P>
<P>THEY that learn thus to de&s;pi&s;e Trad|ing
People as &s;uch, mu&s;t either be intirely
ignorant of the World, or perfectly un|capable
of the ju&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e
Things; they mu&s;t forget &s;ure, that the
Gentry are always willing to &s;ubmit to the
rai&s;ing their Families, by what they call
<HI>City Fortunes;</HI> and how u&s;eful Trade has
always been, and &s;till is in the World on
that Account; while others who call them|&s;elves
Gentlemen, by Way of Di&s;tinction,
became unworthy, by the Scandal of their
Morals, to match with the meane&s;t Citi|zen,
if &s;he be a Woman of Mode&s;ty and
Virtue.</P>
<P>BUT to go on in generals, which is pro|per
to the Head I am talking of; Trade
is the univer&s;al Fund of Wealth through|out
the World; the Gold of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Bra|zil,</HI>
the Silver of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> had
but for Trade remained undi&s;turbed in the
Mines, and in the Sands of the Rivers of
<HI>Guinea</HI> and <HI>Chili:</HI> The Diamonds of <HI>Golconda,</HI>
and of <HI>Borneo</HI> had been glittering, in the
Dirt, and remain'd unpoli&s;h'd to this Day,
if Diligence had not found them out; if
Navigation had not a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Di&s;covery,
and if Trade had not &s;pread and di&s;pers'd
them over the whole Globe.</P>
<P>EVEN <HI>Solomon</HI> had wanted Gold to
adorn the Temple, unle&s;s he had been &s;up|ply'd
<PB N="14" REF="42">
by Miracles; if he had not turn'd
Merchant-Adventurer, and &s;ent his Fleets
to fetch it from the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> that is to
&s;ay, from <HI>Achin,</HI> on the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra,</HI>
which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Ophir</HI> which
his Factors procur'd it at.</P>
<P>So effectually has Trade rais'd the Wealth
of the World, that 'tis remarkable, and
worth the mo&s;t curious Ob&s;ervation, that
throughout the known World, Nations,
and Kingdoms, and Governments are rich
or poor, as they have, or have not, a
Share of the whole Commerce of the
World, or more or le&s;s, &s;ome Concern
in it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Turks,</HI> who are Enemies to Trade,
and who di&s;courage Indu&s;try and Improve|ment,
'tis plain they di&s;people the World,
rather than improve and cultivate it: View
their Condition; they are mi&s;erably poor!
di&s;tre&s;&s;edly poor! they are idle, indolent
and &s;tarving, their Governments have &s;ome
Wealth, becau&s;e they are tyrannical, and
take what they plea&s;e from the poor People,
throughout a va&s;t Extent of Dominion;
&s;o that if it be but a little in a Place, it a|mounts
to a very great Sum in the whole,
the People and Nations which are tributary
to them, being &s;o many; but tho&s;e People
and Nations are poor and wretched to the
la&s;t Degree, and all for Want of Trade.</P>
<P>As to Trade, excepting what the <HI>Europe|ans</HI>
and the <HI>Jews</HI> drive among them, it is
<PB N="15" REF="43">
&s;o little, that it hardly de&s;erves the Name
of Commerce; they have neither Produce of
the Land, or Labour of the People; neither
Merchandi&s;e or Art, nothing is encouraged
among them; Ignorance boa&s;ts indeed of
the rich Return we bring from them, &s;uch
as Drugs, Hair; Silk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But we know it
is not of <HI>Turky,</HI> or the Growth of <HI>Turky,</HI>
but is either the Product of <HI>Armenia</HI> and
<HI>Georgia,</HI> the Provinces of <HI>Guilan</HI> and <HI>In|do&s;tan,</HI>
Part of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> on the Shoar of the
<HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, quite out of the <HI>Turk</HI>'s Do|minions,
and even there they are the Pro|duct
of the old Chri&s;tians Labour, the ori|ginal
Inhabitants of tho&s;e Provinces; the
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> have little or no Hand in it;
they abhor Bu&s;ine&s;s and Labour, and de&s;pi&s;e
Indu&s;try, and they &s;tarve accordingly; or
tho&s;e Goods are the Produce of the I&s;lands
in the <HI>Levant</HI> and the <HI>Archipelague,</HI> where
the <HI>Cotton-yarn,</HI> the <HI>Grogram</HI> or <HI>Goats-Hair</HI>
Yarn, the white or <HI>Beladine Silks, &amp;c.</HI>
are the Manufacture of the poor <HI>Greeks</HI> In|habitants
of tho&s;e I&s;lands, and who by their
Labour in Cultivation, cau&s;e the Earth to
produce the Silk and the Wool, and by their
Labours in Manufacturing, &s;pin and make it
up into Yarn, and into Form, as we have
it from them. Now, <HI>&s;ee the Con&s;equence;</HI>
as the <HI>Mahometans</HI> I &s;ay have little Trade,
&s;o they have little Wealth, the Produce of
their Lands yields little, and that little &s;ells
for &s;uch a little Value, that one would pi$y
<PB N="16" REF="44">
&s;o va&s;t a Body of People labouring, as it
were, for nothing; All the fruitful rich
Countries of <HI>Natolia</HI> and the <HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia,</HI>
from the <HI>Aegean</HI> to the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> once
the mo&s;t rich, populous, and fertile Pro|vinces
of the World, with all the <HI>Morea,</HI>
the <HI>Achaia,</HI> (the <HI>Peloponne&s;us</HI> of the An|tients)
and the fruitful Plains of <HI>The&s;|&s;aly,
Macedonia,</HI> and <HI>Thrace,</HI> from the
<HI>Ionian Sea,</HI> to the Banks of the <HI>Danube;</HI>
what do they now produce? The great Ci|ty
of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is &s;upplied with Corn
indeed, but how? (<HI>N. B.</HI> This is the Rea|&s;on
of mentioning it) when produc'd, &s;old
to the Merchant, &s;hipt on Board the Ve&s;&s;els
which carry it by Sea, the Freight paid, and
all Charges of loading and unloading; yet
their Barley has been bought in the Market
at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for 3 <HI>d. per</HI> Bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>IF this were &s;ome Ages ago, if in were
not known to be &s;o very frequently, and
if there were not &s;ome Merchants now li|ving
in <HI>London,</HI> who are Per&s;ons of un|doubted
Credit, who a&s;&s;ure me they have
bought it &s;o: I &s;ay if it were only, that it
had been &s;o &s;ome Ages ago, it had been
nothing extraordinary, for all know it has
been thus in <HI>England;</HI> but this has been
&s;o at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> within the&s;e Ten or
Twelve Years, and I doubt not it might be
prov'd is often &s;o &s;till in the &s;ame Place,
when plentiful Years of Corn happen;
what the poor Husband-man mu&s;t have for
<PB N="17" REF="45">
his plowing, &s;owing, harve&s;ting, thre&s;hing,
and carrying it out, is hard to imagine;
or what the Landlord has for the Land:
But I &s;uppo&s;e the Grand-Seignior is ge|neral
Landlord, and has his Tax from the
whole Country, in&s;tead of Rent.</P>
<P>Now, whence is all this Poverty of a
Country? 'tis evident 'tis Want of Trade,
and nothing el&s;e: And we may go back
for an Example of it to our own Country,
when the Product of the Land, and the
Labour of the People were as low here,
when good Wheat was worth about 4 <HI>d.
per</HI> Bu&s;hel, a fat Sheep about 3 <HI>s. 4 d.</HI> and
a fat Ox about 18 to 24 <HI>s.</HI> and when was
this? But when we had no Trade, and be|cau&s;e
we had no Trade; neither is the
pre&s;ent Difference owing to any Thing el&s;e,
but to the Increa&s;e of Commerce, as well
here as in other Parts of the World; and
'tis evident the Rate of Provi&s;ions, and
the Value of Lands in all Parts of the
World are high or low, great or &s;mall, as
the People have or have not Trade to
&s;upport it.</P>
<P>TRADE encourages Manufacture, prompts
Invention, employs People, increa&s;es La|bour,
and pays Wages: As the People
are employ'd, they are paid, and by that
Pay are fed, cloathed, kept in Heart, and
kept together; that is, kept at Home, kept
from wandering into Foreign Countries
<PB N="18" REF="46">
to &s;eek Bu&s;ine&s;s, for where the Employ|ment
is, the People will be.</P>
<P>THIS keeping the People together, is
indeed the Sum of the whole Matter, for
as they are kept together, they multiply
together; and the Numbers, which by the
Way is the Wealth and Strength of the
Nation, increa&s;e.</P>
<P>As the Numbers of People increa&s;e,
the Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions increa&s;es; as
the Con&s;umption increa&s;es, the Rate or
Value will ri&s;e at Market; and as the Rate
of Provi&s;ions ri&s;es, the Rents of Land ri&s;e:
So the Gentlemen are with the fir&s;t to feel
the Benefit of Trade, by the Addition to
their E&s;tates.</P>
<P>AND here it would not have been im|proper
to have made a Tran&s;ition to our
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, and to have enquir'd how
punctually the Cour&s;e of Things have
obey'd the Laws of Nature in this very
particular; how as Trade has increa&s;ed; &s;o
by equal Advances, Provi&s;ions have been
con&s;um'd, Lands cultivated, Rents rai&s;ed,
and the E&s;tates of the Gentry and Nobili|ty
been improv'd: I mean as to Periods of
Time, as well as to the Proportion of Va|lue;
which Enquiry would have been an
unan&s;werable Proof of the Fact; but I am
confin'd here to Generals, and mu&s;t only
lay it down as a Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>As the Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions in|crea&s;e,
more Lands are cultivated; wa&s;te
<PB N="19" REF="47">
Grounds are inclo&s;ed, Woods are grubb'd
up, Forre&s;ts and common Lands are till'd,
and improv'd; by this more Farmers are
brought together, more Farm-hou&s;es and
Cottages are built, and more Trades are
called upon to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ary De|mands
of Husbandry: In a Word, as Land
is employ'd, the People increa&s;e of Cour&s;e,
and thus Trade &s;ets all the Wheels of Im|provement
in Motion; for from the Origi|nal
of Bu&s;ine&s;s to this Day it appears, that
the Pro&s;perity of a Nation ri&s;es and falls,
ju&s;t as Trade is &s;upported or decay'd.</P>
<P>As Trade pro&s;pers, Manufactures in|crea&s;e;
as the Demand is greater or &s;mal|ler,
&s;o al&s;o is the Quantity made; and &s;o
the Wages of the Poor, the Rate of Pro|vi&s;ions,
and the Rents and Value of the
Lands ri&s;e or fall, as I &s;aid before.</P>
<P>AND here the very Power and Strength
of the Nation is concern'd al&s;o, for as the
Value of the Lands ri&s;es or falls, the
Taxes ri&s;e and fall in Proportion; all our
Taxes upon Land are a Kind of Pound
Rate; and bring in more or le&s;s, as the
&s;tated Rents of the Land are more or le&s;s
in Value; and let any one calculate, by
the Rate of Lands in <HI>England,</HI> as they
went in the Times of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. or
even in King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. Time, when
Trade began, as it were, ju&s;t to live in
<HI>England;</HI> and tell us how much they think
<PB N="20" REF="48">
a Land Tax would then have brought in:
For Example,</P>
<P>IF a Tax of Four Shillings in the
Pound now brings in above Two Milli|ons,
I &s;uppo&s;e it would have been thought
very well then, if it had brought in Three
hundred thou&s;and Pound, all the re&s;t is an
Increa&s;e occa&s;ion'd by Trade, and by no|thing
el&s;e; Trade has increas'd the People,
and People have increas'd Trade; for Mul|titudes
of People, if they can be put in a
Condition to maintain them&s;elves, mu&s;t in|crea&s;e
Trade; they mu&s;t have Food, that
employs Land; they mu&s;t have Clothes,
that employs the Manufacture; they mu&s;t
have Hou&s;es, that employs Handicrafts; they
mu&s;t have Hou&s;hold Stuff, that employs a
long Variety of Trades; &s;o that in a Word
Trade employs People, and People employ
Trade.</P>
<P>I once &s;aw a Calculation of Trade for
the planting a new Town in the South
Parts of <HI>England,</HI> where, for the Encou|ragement
of People to come and &s;ettle, the
Lords of the Manors, (for the Place lay in
three Manors,) agreed to give a certain
Quantity of Lands to Fifty Farmers, who
would undertake to bring each two hundred
Pound Stock with them, and &s;ettle there.</P>
<P>TO every &s;uch Farmer, they allotted
two hundred Acres of good Land, Rent-free for Twenty Years; and if the Farmer
brought three hundred Pound Stock, he
<PB N="21" REF="49">
had three hundred Acres; be&s;ides the Land,
the &s;aid Lords agreed to find Timber, and
all other Materials for the Building, to eve|ry
Farmer a Hou&s;e, and out of their own
Pockets to build to each Hou&s;e a Barn
and Stables; and thus, with other Encou|ragements,
Fifty Families of &s;ub&s;tantial
Farmers were brought to live in a Kind
of Circle within them&s;elves, with every
one a good Farm to manage, and &s;ufficient
Quantity of Land Rent-free; the Land was
good in it &s;elf, tho' never cultivated before,
&s;o that being clear'd and inclos'd, and gra|dually
plow'd or improv'd, it &s;oon return'd
them a profitable Increa&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Land was &s;o laid out in a large
Circle, that all the Farm-hou&s;es being built
at the Extremities of the re&s;pective Farms,
toward the Center, left a hand&s;ome large
Square Piece of Land which the Lords
re&s;erv'd for the building a Town; and as
the Farm-hou&s;es were &s;o regularly plac'd,
as to front all inwards, they left Ten Spaces
like Streets before their Doors, of which
Five of the Farm-hou&s;es, with their Out|Hou&s;es,
made one Side, and the other
remained to build into a Street as Occa&s;ion
&s;hould pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame Time they publi&s;h'd, That
whoever would come and build on that va|cant
Ground, &s;hould have a certain propor|tion'd
Mea&s;ure of Land allow'd him, ac|cording
to the Size of the Hou&s;e he would
<PB N="22" REF="50">
build, &s;hould have Timber given him gra|tis,
out of the Woods belonging to the
E&s;tate, &s;ufficient for his Building; and to
every Hou&s;e, Land al&s;o added for a Garden
and Orchard, no Rent to be paid for ten
Years, and then a moderate Rent for twenty
Years more; and then a certain Rent (not
at la&s;t immoderate) for the Time to come.</P>
<P>WHEN the Farmers were &s;ettled, for
there is the Sub&s;tance and Rea&s;on of the
Thing, and in this it is exactly to my Pur|po&s;e;
immediately comes a Butcher, and he
runs up a little Shed for the pre&s;ent, till he
could build a Hou&s;e, and &s;ets up a Shop,
to kill and &s;ell Meat for the Farmers.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> As the&s;e Farmers had every one
two Hundred Pounds Stock to begin,
&s;o they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be all Men of
Families, that had Wives and Chil|dren,
and every one had at lea&s;t one or
two, and &s;ome three Servants.</P>
<P>NOR could one Butcher be &s;ufficient to
furni&s;h Meat to fifty Families, but they
were oblig'd to &s;end to neighbouring
Towns for Provi&s;ion, till the fir&s;t Butcher
having Encouragement, two or three more
came afterwards, and &s;et up al&s;o.</P>
<P>AFTER the Example of the Butcher, in
the next Place came a Baker, and he erects
an Oven to &s;upply them with Bread.</P>
<P>FIFTY Families of Farmers limit nece&s;|&s;arily
find Work for a Smith or Farrier to
Shoe their Hor&s;es, and at lea&s;t two Wheel-wrights
<PB N="23" REF="51">
wrights to make and repair their Carts,
Waggons, Plows, Harrows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the&s;e
with the nece&s;&s;ary Iron-work for &s;o much
Building, called in a couple of Black-&s;miths,
whereof one being a Man of Sub&s;tance,
made him&s;elf a kind of Iron-monger, laying
in a Stock of all Sorts of wrought Iron
and Bra&s;s for Building and Furniture, which
on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion they could not be
without.</P>
<P>THIS Collection of Trade&s;men natural|ly
requir'd a Shoe-maker or two to &s;et up,
who &s;oon found Trade enough to &s;upply
the growing Numbers of People with
Shoes and Boots; and likewi&s;e a good ho|ne&s;t
Country Cobler or two could not fail
of Employment to repair them; and (to add
the other Trades working in Leather,) they
could not be without a Collar-maker or
two, for Harne&s;s, Pannels, Saddles, and
all the nece&s;&s;ary Things relating to a Team.</P>
<P>ADD to the&s;e a Turner, an Earthen-ware
Seller, a Glover, a Rope-maker, three or
four Barbers, (perhaps a <HI>Midwife</HI>) end &s;eve|ral
&s;uch Trades as the Nature of things re|quired.</P>
<P>BUT to go back to the building Part,
three Ma&s;ter Carpenters would be the lea&s;t
that could be employ'd in building Hou|&s;es,
and the&s;e would require at fir&s;t five or
&s;ix Pair of Sawyers at lea&s;t, with Journey|men;
that is to &s;ay, Workmen; two or
three Bricklayers, with their Servants and
<PB N="24" REF="52">
Labourers, and perhaps hard by a Brick and
Tile-maker.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the&s;e, one of the Carpenters,
a Man of Sub&s;tance, builds him&s;elf a Wind|mil,
and another builds a &s;econd, and they
both find Work enough (as the Town en|crea&s;ed)
to keep them con&s;tantly employ'd.</P>
<P>THE Town going thus forward, and
&s;tanding in the great Po&s;t Road, comes
an hone&s;t Victualler, and he &s;ets up an Ale-hou&s;e;
and &s;oon after, he is follow'd by
five or &s;ix more; as the fir&s;t encrea&s;ing in
Stock, &s;ees Room for it, he enlarges his
Building, and makes his little Ale-hou&s;e out
into a good Inn, and a &s;econd follows him,
and then a third, and in Proce&s;s of Time,
the Number of Public-Hou&s;es encrea&s;e to
eleven or twelve in all; whereof as above,
three are very hand&s;ome Inns, and per|haps
&s;ell Wine as well as &s;trong Drink.</P>
<P>BY this Time the Lords of the Manors
begin to think it proper to build their new
Tenants a Church, for which they lay out
a hand&s;ome Piece of Ground in the Center
of the Town, and a large Burying-Ground
added to it; and obtaining Licence from
the Bi&s;hop, they con&s;ecrate the Building;
and being joint Patrons, pre&s;ent in Turn,
getting a Law to erect it into a Pari&s;h,
and to a&s;&s;ertain the Tithe and Maintenance
of the Incumbent, as in like Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>HITHER TO Nature acted it all, but this
Part indeed, the Piety of the Patrons &s;upplies;

our Bu&s;ine&s;s is (in both) to ob&s;erve the ordi|nary

of the Sun; the Settlement of the
Farmers gives a Summons to the Trade&s;men
that &s;upply them with Nece&s;&s;aries, and lets
them know, that there they may find Bu|&s;ine&s;s
and Employment: The nece&s;&s;ity of

<P>BUT to proceed; Fame &s;preads the News
of a Town newly erected, and a Number
of Families brought together; A Grocer
goes to &s;ee if there is no Room for him,
and finding no Supplies of his Kind, he
takes a Piece of Ground in one of the
principal Streets, and marks him&s;elf out a
Place for his Hou&s;e; but fir&s;t, as before,
runs up a Booth or Shed, &s;tores it with
Goods, and opens a Shop, and two or
three Chandlers Shops do the &s;ame in re|moter
Parts, buying their Goods perhaps of
him.</P>
<P>AN Apothecary does the like next Door
to him, and a Mercer next to him; then a
Haberda&s;her of Hats, a Draper and a Mil|lener;
and thus the Town is inhabited and
furni&s;h'd by Degrees with all Sorts of ne|ce&s;&s;ary
People and Things; till after &s;ome
Time, the Lords of the Manors, to carry
on the Improvement, get a Patent for a
<PB N="26" REF="54">
Market once a Week, and a Fair perhaps
twice a Year, or oftner, as there is Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e advanc'd Circum&s;tances, other
Trades fall in; as <HI>I&s;t,</HI> more Ale-hou&s;es;
<HI>2d,</HI> a common Brewer; <HI>3d,</HI> a Cooper for
Casks of all Sorts; a Pewterer, two or
three Lawyers, (or Attorneys, rather) for
drawing Writings, making Bonds, Bargains
and Agreements between Man and Man,
and one of the&s;e in Time gets him&s;elf made
a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and &s;o there is an imme|diate
Magi&s;trate among them.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time other Trades fill up
the Streets; a Malt-hou&s;e, perhaps two or
three are erected, that the Inhabitants may
brew their own Beer if they plea&s;e; a Sur|geon
in Ca&s;e of Di&s;a&s;ter, for by this Time
the Town begins to grow populous.</P>
<P>THE good Women al&s;o being diligent,
and good Hou&s;e-wives, they &s;pin, and in
Con&s;equence of that, there mu&s;t be a Li|nen
Weaver, and a Woollen-weaver, a Flax

<P>THUS far the Nature and Con&s;equence

Rochelle, Mar&s;eilles, Genoa, <HI>Leg|horn,

the other hand might name &s;everal Cities,
which being depriv'd of their Trade, have
&s;unk again in Proportion, as their Trade

<P>I need not travel over the Globe, to give
you Examples in remoter Places, where
the great Emporiums, the greate&s;t trading
Cities in the World, have &s;unk into Ruin
by the Stop of their Commerce, &s;uch as
<HI>Tripoli, Sinope,</HI> and <HI>Trapezond</HI> in the
<HI>Euxine</HI> or <HI>Black Sea,</HI> who&s;e Trade is cut
off, by the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;topping the Navigation
of the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> and cutting off the
Trade they carried on with <HI>Europe;</HI> or
&s;uch as <HI>Suez,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> Ports an|tiently
of prodigious Concour&s;e, both of
Ships and Merchants; but emptied of both,
by the <HI>Europeans</HI> finding the Way to the
<HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> by the Cape of <HI>Good-hope;</HI> or
&s;uch as the famous Cities of <HI>Tyre</HI> and
<HI>Corinth,</HI> who having been the Envy of the
World for Wealth, and that Wealth obtain'd
by their Commerce, were overturn'd; the
fir&s;t by the <HI>Grecians,</HI> the la&s;t by the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
purely for the avaritious Part; and
<PB N="32" REF="60">
who, their Merchants being de&s;troy'd, and
their Trade overthrown, never recover'd
their Figure any more than their Fortunes
in the World.</P>
<P>IN a Word, it appears by innumerable
Examples, that Trade is the Life of the
World's Pro&s;perity, and all the Wealth that
has been extraordinary, whether of Na|tions
or Cities, has been rai&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>THE Nature of the Thing indeed im|plies
it; as the Indu&s;try of Mankind is &s;et
on Work, their Hopes and Views are rais'd,
and their Ambition fir'd: The View and
Pro&s;pect of Gain in&s;pires the World with the
keene&s;t Vigor, puts new Life into their
Souls; and when they &s;ee the Succe&s;s and
Pro&s;perity of trading Nations, it rouzes
them up to the like Application.</P>
<P>LET us view the differing Face of the
Nations, (and of the People who inhabit
them) where they have no Trade; how mi|&s;erable
is the Scene of Life? The Countries
look de&s;olate, the People &s;ad and dejected,
poor and di&s;con&s;olate, heavy and indolent;
not for Want of Will to labour, but for
Want of &s;omething to labour profitably at;
the Rich are &s;lothful, becau&s;e they are rich
and proud, the Poor, becau&s;e they are
poor and de&s;pair; for it will ever be true</P>
<P>That Poverty makes Sloth, and Sloth
makes 'Poor.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="61">
We &s;ay of &s;ome Nations, the People are
lazy, but we &s;hould &s;ay only, they are poor;
Poverty is the Fountain of all Manner
of Idlene&s;s; they have in &s;hort nothing to
do, no Employment in which they can get
their Bread by their Labour; their Work
gets no Wages for Want of Trade, and
their Trade no Increa&s;e for Want of La|bour;
Diligence promotes Trade, and Trade
encourages Diligence; Labour feeds Trade,
and Trade feeds the Labourer.</P>
<P>THERE is hardly that Country to be
nam'd in the World, where there is no
Room for Improvement by Indu&s;try and
Application; nay, we find an indu&s;trious
People often thriving and wealthy, under
the weighty Di&s;couragements of a barren
Soil, an inho&s;pitable Climate, a tempe&s;tu|ous
Sea, a remote Situation, having yet
&s;omething or other for Trade to work
upon.</P>
<P>THE People of <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> ha|ving
nothing but Mountains and Woods,
and the mo&s;t barren inclement Air and Soil
in the World; yet, rather than not trade,
and rather than not labour, they cut down
their Trees, and &s;end them abroad to build
Cities, and build Navies in other Countries,
and have hardly any of their own.</P>
<P>IF their Woods grow remote from the
Sea or Water Carriage, Indu&s;try dictates
to them to cut them down and burn them;
and to trade, if it be but with the very
<PB N="34" REF="62">
Sap and Juices of the Trees: Hence they
&s;end us Tar, Pitch, Rozin, Turpentine;
and we &s;ee as it were a whole Wood
brought away in Cask; Ten, Twenty
Thou&s;and La&s;t of Tar brought from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>
at a Time, every La&s;t being Ten to Twelve
Barrels.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Spitsbergen</HI> are un|&s;ufferably
cold: if Nature, not being able to
&s;upport the Violence of it, leaves tho&s;e Pla|ces
uninhabited; the diligent Trader not
being to be di&s;couraged by Difficulties, flies
directly thither; there among a Thou&s;and
Dangers, &s;urrounded with Mountains of
Ice, terrible, and Horrors enough to chill
the very Soul to de&s;cribe them, <HI>Hunts</HI>
the great <HI>Leviathan</HI> of the Seas, and loads
his Ships with the fat (BLUBBER) of a Thou|&s;and
Whales.</P>
<P>I might in&s;tance in the Severities of the
torrid, as well as frigid Zone, and &s;hew
the Hard&s;hips undergone in Places &s;corch'd
with the Violence of the Heat; and which
are every Way as terrible in their Kind, as
tho&s;e of exce&s;&s;ive Cold; &s;uch are the Di&s;|ea&s;es
and Terrors of the long Calms, where
the Sea &s;tagnates and corrupts for Want of
Motion; and by the Strength of the
Scorching Sun &s;tinks and poi&s;ons the di|&s;tre&s;t
Mariners, who are rendered unactive,
and di&s;abled by Scurvies, raging and mad
with Calentures and Fevers, and drop
into Death in &s;uch a Manner, that at la&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="63">
the Living are lo&s;t, for Want of the Dead,
that is, for want of Hands to work the Ship.</P>
<P>YET nothing di&s;courages the diligent
Seaman, or the adventrous Merchant in
Pur&s;uit of Trade, and pu&s;hing on Di&s;cove|ries,
planting Colonies, and &s;ettling Com|merce,
even to all Parts of the World.</P>
<P>NOW as I &s;aid before, that the Nations
who want Trade look dejected and &s;ad, &s;o
on the contrary, let the curious Traveller
ob&s;erve, as he pa&s;&s;es thro' the World, the
trading manufacturing Nations have a quite
different A&s;pect; their Labour, however
hard and heavy, is perform'd chearfully;
a general Sprightline&s;s and Vigour appears
among them; their Countenances are blith,
and they are merrier at their Labour, than
others are at their Play; their Hearts are
warm, as their Hands are quick; they are
all Spirit and Life, and it may be &s;een in
their Faces; or which is more, it is &s;een
in their Labour; as they live better than
the Poor of the &s;ame Cla&s;s in other Coun|tries,
&s;o they work harder: And here the
&s;ame <HI>Antithe&s;is</HI> is ob&s;ervable as before, tho'
in its contrary Extreme; for as I &s;aid there,
that Poverty makes Sloth, and Sloth makes
Poor: So here,
<Q>Labour makes Gain, and Gain gives
Strength to Labour.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="64">
AS they labour harder, &s;o they get more
for their Work than other Nations, and
this gives them Spirit for their Labour.
And this is the immediate Effect of Trade,
for the Poor of the trading and manufac|turing
Countries are employ'd on better
Terms, and have better Wages for their
Work, than the Poor of tho&s;e Countries
where there is le&s;s Trade.</P>
<P>WE are told, that in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
when for want of Commerce, La|bour
was not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Art; they had no
other Way to cut out a large Plank, but
by felling a great Tree, and then with a
multitude of Hands and Axes hew away
all the Sides of the Timber, till they re|duc'd
the middle to one large Plank; and
that yet, when it was done, they would
&s;ell this Plank as cheap, as the <HI>Swedes</HI> or
<HI>Pru&s;&s;ians</HI> did the like, who cut three or
four, or more Planks of the like Size from
one Tree by the Help of Saws and Saw-Mills:
The Con&s;equence mu&s;t be, that
the mi&s;erable <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> labour'd ten times
as much as the other did, for the &s;ame
Money.</P>
<P>WE are told frequently, when &s;uch and
&s;uch great Works or Buildings were fini&s;h|ed,
Men work'd for a Penny a Day here
in <HI>England;</HI> and perhaps they did &s;o; but
as I &s;aid before, &s;peaking of the Cheapne&s;s
of Provi&s;ions, that it was before we had
any Trade among us; &s;o it mu&s;t be as to
<PB N="37" REF="65">
Wages, for as Trade rai&s;es Wages, &s;o Wa|ges
rai&s;e Provi&s;ions; and this is the Rea|&s;on,
why, as all Foreigners grant that our
Poor in <HI>England</HI> work harder than they
do in any other Nation; &s;o it mu&s;t be
own'd, they eat and drink better in Pro|portion;
and this is, becau&s;e they have bet|ter
Wages.</P>
<P>I might examine this Article of Wages,
and carry it thro' almo&s;t every Branch of
Bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>England;</HI> and it would ap|pear,
that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poor earn more
Money than the &s;ame Cla&s;s of Men or
Women can do at the &s;ame kind of Work,
in any other Nation.</P>
<P>NOR will it be deny'd, but that they do
more Work al&s;o: So then, if they do more
Work, and have better Wages too, they
mu&s;t needs live better, and fare better;
and it is true al&s;o, that they cannot &s;up|port
their Labour without it.</P>
<P>AND here I may grant, that a <HI>French</HI>
Man &s;hall do more Work than an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Man, if they &s;hall be oblig'd to live on the
&s;ame Diet; that is to &s;ay, the Foreigner &s;hall
&s;tarve with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man for a Wager,
and will be &s;ure to win: He will live and
work, when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man &s;hall &s;ink
and dye; but let them live both the &s;ame
Way, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man &s;hall beggar the
<HI>French</HI> Man, for tho' the <HI>French</HI> Man
were to &s;pend all his Wages, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Man will out-work him.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="66">
IT is true again, the <HI>French</HI> Man's Di|ligence
is the greate&s;t, he &s;hall work more
Hours than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man; but the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Man &s;hall do as much Bu&s;ine&s;s in the
fewer Hours, as the Foreigner who &s;its
longer at it.</P>
<P>TO conclude this Head, I would not
&s;eem to be partial in Favour of our own
Country; but it mu&s;t be added, that their
Work is better perform'd al&s;o; and I ap|peal
for the Truth of it, to their &s;everal Per|formances,
of which I could give Examples,
and which all the Markets in the World are
at this Time Witne&s;&s;es to; but this begins
to be particular, I &s;hall &s;peak at large to
the &s;everal Examples of it in their proper
Places.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ufficient to the Purpo&s;e here to
ob&s;erve as above, that the diligent trading
manufacturing World work chearfully, live
comfortably; they &s;ing at their Labour,
work by their Choice, eat and drink well,
and their Work goes on plea&s;antly, and with
Succe&s;s: Whereas the unemploy'd World
groan out their Souls in Angui&s;h and Sor|row,
not by their Work, but for want of
it; and &s;ink, as I may ju&s;tly &s;ay, under the
Weight of their Idlene&s;s and Sloth; what
little Work they do, is done with Reluct|ance
and Grief, becau&s;e the &s;mall Wages
they have for it, gives them no Comfort
when it is done.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="67">
TRAVELLING in the North Part of <HI>Bri|tain,</HI>
I ob&s;erved, that, in the Time of
their Harve&s;t, they had always an Over|&s;eer
to keep the Reapers to their Work,
and a Bag-pipe to encourage them while
they were at Work: And one of our Com|pany
ob&s;erving that we had no &s;uch merry

a Bannock, and a Draught of Water only;
and twice in the Day, the Farmer or Stew|ard
gave them every one a Dram of <HI>Gla&s;|gow</HI>
Brandy, as they call'd it; that is to

Bag-Pipe; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> they work with a Vigor
and Spirit, not to be &s;een in other Coun|tries.</P>
<P>I could give like Examples among the
Manufacturers; the Spirit and Courage of
the Workmen, is &s;een in the Goodne&s;s and
Sub&s;tance of their Manufacture; of which,
this mu&s;t be &s;aid, our Manufacture may
not be &s;o cheap as the &s;ame Kinds made in
other Countries; but bring them to the
Scale and try their Sub&s;tance, you will find
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man's Work, according to his
Wages, out-weigh the other; as his Beer
is &s;trong, &s;o is his Work; and as he gives
more Strength of Sinews to his Strokes
in the Loom, his Work is firmer and fa&s;ter,
and carries a greater Sub&s;tance with it, than
the &s;ame Kinds of Goods, and of the &s;ame
Denomination made in foreign Parts.</P>
<P>I remember in our former Conte&s;ts a|bout
Commerce, great Noi&s;e was made of
the <HI>French</HI> imitating our woollen Manu|facture,
and making them to &s;uch Perfecti|on,
as to out-do us in foreign Markets;
from whence it was inferr'd, that they
would in Time &s;upplant our Trade, and
carry away the Bu&s;ine&s;s from us: The Rea|&s;on
that was given, was, that their Poor
could work &s;o much cheaper than ours, that
their Goods would be &s;old cheaper than
<PB N="41" REF="69">
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and con&s;equently they would
have the fir&s;t and be&s;t of the Market al|ways
from us; and had this been fully and
fairly made out; had they brought &s;ufficient
Evidence of the Facts &s;ugge&s;ted, the Infe|rence
had been good. Now to prove how
finely the <HI>French</HI> perform'd, and how good
their Cloths were; Patterns were &s;hew'd
here of their &s;everal Cloths, as fini&s;h'd for
the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade, by the great Manufacto|ry,
as they call it, in <HI>Languedoc;</HI> for it was
this Part that was brought for the Sup|port
of the Argument; and it is true,
that the Patterns were extraordinary, the
Cloth well dre&s;s'd, the Colours well dy'd;
nay, to Perfection; and to a &s;uperficial Eye,
they rather went beyond the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than
come &s;hort of them.</P>
<P>BUT when they came to be look'd well
into by Clothiers and Workmen who un|der&s;tood
it, and who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it was; the
Deficiency &s;oon di&s;cover'd it &s;elf; their
Cloths appear'd to be &s;light, thin, with|out
Sub&s;tance and Proportion, and unfit to
do Service in wearing; in a word, they
were no Way equal in Goodne&s;s to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Manufucture of the &s;ame Kind. This
was farther prov'd by the <HI>Armenian</HI> Mer|chants
at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and other
Places in <HI>Turky,</HI> where the &s;aid Goods were
u&s;ually &s;old; where upon bringing the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Cloths to the Scale,
there was no Compari&s;on between them;
<PB N="42" REF="70">
but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> always out-weigh'd them
forty to fifty Pound <HI>per</HI> Bale, and &s;ome|times
much more; the Con&s;equence of
which was,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT tho&s;e <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants
would very &s;eldom buy the <HI>French Cloths,</HI>
&s;o long as there were any of the <HI>Engli&s;h
Cloths</HI> left at the Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT when they did buy them,
they always had them at a much cheaper
Rate.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THIS is an evident Proof of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
manner of performing; and it will hold in
many other Ca&s;es, perhaps in all Manufac|turing
Ca&s;es: The &s;trong Labour of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Workmen in all their manual Ope|rations
is very remarkable in the Works
them&s;elves: And I &s;ay, it is evident in many
other Manufactures, be&s;ides that of Broad-Cloths; <HI>in a word,</HI> our Workmen, by the
meer Vigour and Strength of their Spirits,
&s;upported by their &s;trong Feeding, and by
their better Wages than in any other Na|tion,
are not u&s;ed to work &s;light and &s;uper|ficially,
but &s;trong and &s;ub&s;tantial in every
Thing they do; and as they have better
Wages for it than other Nations give, and
perform their Work accordingly, &s;o their
Goods make it evident, for that they fetch
a better Price at Market, than any Goods
of the &s;ame Species, made in any other
Country.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="71">
IT is the &s;ame Thing in their &s;everal
Manufactures of Bra&s;s and Iron, and other
Hard-ware Works; but e&s;pecially, in their
building of Ships, in which it is evident,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French, Swedes</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI>
build cheaper; but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> build &s;tron|ger
and firmer; and an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship will
always endure more &s;everity, load heavier,
and reign (<HI>as the Seamen call it</HI>) longer,
than any foreign built Ship whatever; the
Examples are &s;een every Year, particularly
in the Coal Trade, the Loading of which is
very heavy, and the Ships &s;wim deep in the
Water, by the Eagerne&s;s of the Matters,
to carry large Burthens; and yet it is fre|quently
known, that a <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> or <HI>Ip&s;|wich
built Colier,</HI> &s;hall reign, (as I &s;ay the
Seamen call it) forty to fifty Years, and
come to a good End at la&s;t; that is, be
broken up; not founder at Sea, or break
her Back upon the Sands, as Ships weaker
built, often, nay generally do.</P>
<P>THE firm Building, as well as beautiful
Moulds of our Men of War confirm this
al&s;o, in which they out-la&s;t, as well as out|&s;hine,
the &s;tronge&s;t and fine&s;t built Ships
of mo&s;t other Nations, it not of all Nations
in <HI>Europe,</HI> except only tho&s;e Ca&s;tle-built
clum&s;y Things called <HI>Galeons,</HI> which are
built &s;o &s;trong, that is, &s;o thick, that they
are &s;carce fit for any thing.</P>
<P>THE Compari&s;on is &s;till to my Purpo&s;e
in every Part, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that Trade invigorates
<PB N="44" REF="72">
the World, gives Employment to the Peo|ple,
rai&s;es Pay for their Labour, and en|crea&s;es
that Pay as their Labour encrea&s;es,
and as their Performance excels; and it ap|pears
that what is &s;aid of <HI>England</HI> is no Com|pliment
to our own Country, but a real,
hi&s;torical Truth; for that 'tis undeniable,
that the Labour of the Poor is no where ra|ted
&s;o high as in <HI>England:</HI> There is no
Nation in the World where the Poor have
equal Wages for their Work as in <HI>England,</HI>
in Proportion to the Rate of Money, and
to the Rate of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>BY this Means the labouring Poor are
kept in Heart, kept &s;tong, and made able
for the Bu&s;ine&s;s they are employ'd in;
and the contrary, is the Rea&s;on why the
<HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Italians,</HI> and mo&s;t other Na|tions,
rather make their Manufacture (of
any Kind) gay than good, fine than &s;trong.
I allow them to be as exqui&s;ite in Art, nay
I may allow them to be more apt to in|vent
and contrive, and perhaps fini&s;h &s;ome
Things with more Ornament: But for
Strength of Hand in their Works, where
Strength is e&s;&s;ential to the Value of the
Work, there our People out-do them all.</P>
<P>I could carry this on thro' many Parti|culars,
and it would lead me into &s;ome ve|ry
u&s;eful Speculations, but they would
be remote from my Purpo&s;e; I bring it back
therefore to the &s;ingle Point which I am
upon; namely, the great Advantage of
<PB N="45" REF="73">
Commerce to the World, and to particu|lar
Nations.</P>
<P>WHEN we had no Trade, we had no
Ships, no populous Cities, no Numbers
of People, no Wealth compar'd to what
we &s;ee now; Provi&s;ions bore no Price,
Lands yielded no Rent; and why? The
Rea&s;on is plain and &s;hort; 'tis &s;um'd up in
a Word, <HI>Labour</HI> brought in <HI>no Wages.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> OBSERVE by the Word, no, or
none, is not meant litterally and &s;trictly
<HI>none at all;</HI> but comparatively none
compar'd to what is &s;een now.</P>
<P>THE People were divided into Ma&s;ter
and Servant; not Landlord and Tenant,
but the Lord and the Va&s;&s;al; the Tenant
paid no Rent, but held his Lands in Va&s;|&s;allage;
that is, for Services to be perform|ed;
&s;uch and &s;uch Tenants plow'd his
Land; &s;uch and &s;uch fenc'd his Park; &s;uch
and &s;uch Lands were let out to furni&s;h the
Lord's Kitchen with Poultry, &s;uch with
Eggs, &s;ome with one Thing, &s;ome with
another; and thus the Lord liv'd, as the
<HI>Scots</HI> call it, in the middle of his Geer.</P>
<P>THE under People to the&s;e Tenants held
by Villenage; that is, the Labourers, tho&s;e
we now call Husbandmen and Cottagers,
the&s;e did the Drudgery, were Grooms to
look after his Hor&s;es, drive his Teams, fell
his Woods, Fence, Hedge. Ditch, Thre&s;h,
and in a Word, do all &s;ervile Labours;
and for this they had their Bread; that is,
<PB N="46" REF="74">
they had a poor Cottage, &s;carce &s;o good as
a tolerable modern Hog&s;tye to live in,
they drank at the Pump, and eat at the Kit|chen
Door, Beggar-like: As for the re&s;t,
the Lord of the Manor was their King;
nay, if I had &s;aid their God, I had not
err'd, &s;o much as &s;ome may think; for they
wor&s;hip'd him with &s;uch a blind Subjecti|on,
that at his Command they would re|bel
again&s;t their King, and take up the Bow
and Arrow again&s;t whom&s;oever he com|manded
them.</P>
<P>THIS was the Ca&s;e, even in this flouri&s;h|ing
Nation of <HI>England,</HI> till Trade came in
to make the Difference; and give me leave
to a&s;&s;ume &s;o much, I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that
Trade alone made the Difference; and the
Climax is very remarkable.</P>
<P>BEFORE the People fell into Trade,
what was the Ca&s;e as to Wealth? You &s;ee
how it &s;tood with the People; but what
was the Ca&s;e of the Trade.</P>
<P>1. WE had no Manufacture; we had
Wool indeed, and Tin, and Lead, tho&s;e
were Funds, and brought in &s;ome Sub|&s;tance;
but who had it? Truly, the Church
and the Gentry; the religious Hou&s;es and
the Barons had the Lands and the Sheep,
and con&s;equently the Wool: And we find
that in King <HI>Edward</HI> III's Time, the
Clergy and the religious Hou&s;es gave the
King a fifth Part of all their Wool for car|rying
on his Wars again&s;t <HI>France:</HI> This
<PB N="47" REF="75">
Wool was &s;ent abroad to the <HI>Flemings,</HI>
and this Money was the Wealth of the Na|tion.</P>
<P>2. THIS Money went all abroad again
generally &s;peaking, for tho&s;e ruinous Wars,
which for many Ages the Kings of <HI>England</HI>
carried on, &s;ometimes in <HI>France;</HI> &s;ometimes
in the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> &s;ometimes in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
&s;ometimes in <HI>Brittany,</HI> and the like in o|ther
Places; &s;o that &s;till the People were
impoveri&s;h'd, I mean the Gentry and Cler|gy;
for this Wealth was theirs, and
they paid all the Taxes: As for the labour|ing
Poor, they &s;carcely knew what Money
was.</P>
<P>3. AS to Trade, it was carry'd on by
the <HI>E&s;terlings;</HI> that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Hans</HI>
Towns, and by the <HI>Flemings;</HI> and they
carry'd away your Wool, Lead, Tin, and
whatever el&s;e you had, and &s;upply'd you a|gain
with Cloths, Spice, (Wine there was
none, or but little to be had) and in a
word, with Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, Iron,
and whatever el&s;e was to be had from A|broad;
and the&s;e run away with all the lit|tle
Wealth which the King and the Wars
left among you; they brought you Ships,
they coin'd your Money, and they in &s;hort
grew rich by you, and you look'd on and
&s;tarv'd.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, by the Prudence of King <HI>Henry</HI>
VII. you fell to Trade among your&s;elves;
and gradually getting Ground of the World,
<PB N="48" REF="76">
you made your&s;elves Ma&s;ters of your own
Manufactures, about the middle of Queen
<HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Reign; and what &s;he did to en|courage
it, I &s;hall &s;hew in its Place. And
now what follow'd? The Con&s;equences
were mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly &s;een in a few Years, as
follows.</P>
<P>1. YOUR People turn'd Merchants abroad,
as well as Manufacturers at home: They
ta&s;ted the Sweets of Commerce, and being
encourag'd by the Gain, &s;oon &s;upplanted
their Supplanters, built their own Ships, &s;ent
out their own Goods, brought Home their
own Returns, ca&s;hier'd the <HI>E&s;terlings,</HI> for|bid
the Wool going Abroad, and thereby
ruin'd the <HI>Flemings;</HI> and thus they &s;et up
for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>2. AS to the Country, the Revolution of
Trade, brought a Revolution in the very
Nature of Things; the Poor began to
work, not for Cottages and Liveries, but
for Money, and to live, as we &s;ay, at their
own Hands: The Women and Children
learnt to &s;pin and get Money for it, a
Thing entirely new to them, and what they
had never &s;een before. The Men left the
Hedge and the Ditch, and were &s;et at Work
by the Manufacturers to be Wool-Comb|ers,
Weavers, Fullers, Clothworkers, Car|riers,
and innumerable happy Labours they
perform'd, which they knew nothing of be|fore;
nay the <HI>Flemings</HI> came over (for Mo|ney)
and taught them how to perform tho&s;e
<PB N="49" REF="77">
Things at fir&s;t, <HI>I &s;ay at fir&s;t,</HI> for the People
&s;oon became able to &s;end Home their Ma|&s;ters,
and teach one another; then the
Villains and Va&s;&s;als were taken Appren|tices
to the Manufacturers, till coming to
be Ma&s;ters, the Name, nay the very Things
them&s;elves call'd Va&s;&s;alage and Villanage
grew out of U&s;e. The Va&s;&s;als got Money
by Trade, and the Villains by Labour; and
the Lords found the Sweets of it too, for
they &s;oon buy off the Services, and bring
the Lords to take Money. Thus the Cot|tagers
growing rich, bought their little
Cotts with right of Commonage for their
Lives, renewable &s;o and &s;o, as they could
agree, and this was called Coppy-hold.
On the other hand, the Va&s;&s;als and Feu|holders,
as they are call'd to this Day in
the <HI>North,</HI> growing rich, lump'd it with
the Lords, and for a Sum of Money bought
off their &s;lavi&s;h Tenures, and got their
Lea&s;es turn'd into Free-holds; and to fini&s;h
the great Fabrick, the Farmers of Lands
were now enabled to take them at a Rent
certain, and the Gentry got a Revenue in
Money, which they under&s;tood nothing of
before.</P>
<P>I might enlarge here upon the differing
Effects of Luxury and Frugality, which
became more than ordinarily vi&s;ible upon
this Change of Affairs; namely, that as
the frugal Manufacturers, encourag'd by
their Succe&s;s, doubled their Indu&s;try and
<PB N="50" REF="78">
good Husbandty, they lay'd up Money, and
grew rich; and the luxurious and Pur&s;e
proud Gentry, tickl'd with the happy En|crea&s;e
of their Revenues, and the ri&s;ing Va|lue
of their Rents, grew vain, gay, luxu|rious
and expensive: So the fir&s;t encreas'd
daily, and the latter, with all their new en|creas'd
and advanc'd Revenues, yet grew
poor and nece&s;&s;itous, till the former began
to buy them out; and have &s;o bought them
out, that whereas in tho&s;e Days, the Lands
were all in the Hands of the <HI>Barons;</HI> that
is to &s;ay, the Nobility, and even the
Knights and E&s;quires who had Lands, and
were call'd the Gentry, held them by &s;er|vile
Tenures, as above: Now we &s;ee the
Nobility and the ancient Gentry have al|mo&s;t
every where &s;old their E&s;tates, and the
Commonalty and Trade&s;men have bought
them: So that now the Gentry are richer
than the Nobility, and the Trade&s;men are
richer than them all.</P>
<P>I have given this Sketch of the growing
Wealth of the World by Trade, as in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
that is, I have placed the Scene as in
<HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e being talking to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Nation, it will be under&s;tood with the
more ea&s;e. But the Subject is general, and
the Thing is not of private Interpretation:
It will hold in its Degree, in all the
trading Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as here;
tho' perhaps in none more eminently, the
Trade here having made &s;o vi&s;ible a Change
<PB N="51" REF="79">
in the Face of the Nation, and in the Cir|cum&s;tances
of the People, that the like is
not to be &s;hewn of any other Nation, in
&s;o very remarkable a Degree; &s;o that if I
had been Writing in any other Country or
Language, I &s;hould certainly have &s;ingled
out <HI>England</HI> for an Example.</P>
<P>I may, however, refer to other Nations
for Evidence in their Proportion, for in all
the Manufacturing Countries in <HI>Europe</HI>
the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame in Degree; as Trade
has encreas'd, the Mi&s;eries of the People
have abated, the Poor being employ'd by
Manufacture, by Navigation, and the or|dinary
Labours which Trade furni&s;hes for
their Hands; they have accordingly liv'd
better, their Poverty has been le&s;s, and they
have been able to feed, who before might
be &s;aid only to &s;tarve; and in tho&s;e Coun|tries
'tis ob&s;ervable, that where Trade is mo&s;t
effectually extended, and has the greate&s;t
Influence, there the Poor live be&s;t, their
Wages are highe&s;t; and where Wages are
highe&s;t, the Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions en|crea&s;es
mo&s;t; where the Con&s;umption of
Provi&s;ion is mo&s;t encreas'd, the Rate of
Provi&s;ion is highe&s;t; and where Provi&s;ions
are deare&s;t, the Rents of Lands are ad|vanc'd
mo&s;t.</P>
<P>AGAIN, <HI>for the Climax does not end here;</HI>
where the Rents of Lands are advanc'd, the
Taxes and Payments to the Governour are
the larger; and where the larger Taxes
<PB N="52" REF="80">
are levy'd, the Revenue being encrea&s;ed,
that Prince or Governour is the richer;
and where Nations grow richer, they in
Proportion grow more powerful.</P>
<P>THUS Trade is the Foundation of Wealth,
and Wealth of Power: In former Days the
Poverty of the northern Nations added to
their Multitude, made them formidable;
as the People encreas'd, the Country not
being able to maintain them, the old ones
drove the young ones out, as Bees ca&s;t
their Swarms, to &s;eek Place to dwell in,
and by the force of their Arms, to make
Room for them&s;elves in warmer Climates,
and move in a more fruitful Soil. Thus
the <HI>Alani,</HI> the <HI>Gauls,</HI> the <HI>Hunns,</HI> invaded
<HI>Italy;</HI> the <HI>Goths</HI> overrun <HI>Spain;</HI> the <HI>Van|dals,
Spain</HI> and the Northern Parts of
<HI>Africa;</HI> the <HI>Thracians, Natolia</HI> and <HI>Ma|cedonia,</HI>
and the like.</P>
<P>BUT in our Times, the Ca&s;e alters uni|ver&s;ally,
the Art of War is &s;o well &s;tudy'd,
and &s;o equally known in all Places, that 'tis
the longe&s;t Pur&s;e that conquers now, not the
longe&s;t Sword. If there is any Country
who&s;e People are le&s;s martial, le&s;s enter|pri&s;ing,
and le&s;s able for the Field; yet, if
they have but more Money than their
Neighbours, they &s;hall &s;oon be &s;uperior to
them in Strength, for Money is Power,
and they that have the <HI>Gelt,</HI> (as the <HI>Dutch</HI>
call it) may have Armies of the be&s;t Troops
in <HI>Europe,</HI> and Generals of the greate&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="81">
Experience to fight for them at the &s;hort|e&s;t
Warning imaginable; thus upon &s;udden
Quarrels, Princes and States do not now
go Home and rai&s;e Armies, and li&s;t Men,
but they go Home and rai&s;e Money; and
that being done, they look abroad to hire
Armies, and, hire Men, and even to enter|tain
Generals; &s;o that they need never
bring any new rai&s;ed Troops into the Field,
but old <HI>Veteran</HI> experience'd Soldiers, &s;uch
as <HI>Swi&s;s, Germans,</HI> &amp;c. well Officer'd,
and led on by the greate&s;t Generals in the
World; &s;o that War is made in a trice, and
deci&s;ive Battles are fought now in &s;horter
Time than Troops in former Times could
be brought into the Field.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Venetians</HI> have had their Ge|nerals
<HI>Shuylenbergh, Coningsmark, Baden,
&amp;c.</HI> to lead their Troops; the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
had their Marquis <HI>de Lede;</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>
their Duke of <HI>Croy,</HI> their Generals <HI>Gordon,
Konning&s;eck,</HI> &amp;c. and Armies of <HI>Danes,
Pru&s;&s;ians, Lunenbergers, Saxons, He&s;&s;i|ans,</HI>
and <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and other <HI>Germans,</HI>
be&s;ides <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> and <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> are to be hired
for Money, alternately to fight, for now
one Side, than another; I &s;ay, <HI>alternately,</HI>
as the Per&s;ons direct them who&s;e Money
they take; without Regard to Parties or
Intere&s;ts, either of Politicks or Religion,
tho' whether for or again&s;t the Party or
Religion they profe&s;s; to Day for Papi&s;t,
<PB N="54" REF="82">
to Morrow for Prote&s;tant; be it for God
or for <HI>Baal,</HI> as they're hired, they go
<Q>And always fight according as they're
paid.</Q></P>
<P>THUS Money rai&s;es Armies, and Trade
rai&s;es Money; and &s;o it may be truly &s;aid
of Trade, that it makes Princes powerful,
Nations valiant, and the mo&s;t effeminate
People that can't fight for them&s;elves, if
they have but Money, and can hire other
People to fight for them, they become as
formidable as any of their Neighbours.</P>
<P>SEEING Trade then is the Fund of
Wealth and Power, we cannot wonder that
we &s;ee the wi&s;e&s;t Princes and States an|xious
and concerned for the Encrea&s;e of the
Commerce and Trade of their Subjects,
and of the Growth of the Country; an|xious
to propagate the Sale of &s;uch Goods
as are the Manufacture of their own Sub|jects,
and that employs their own People;
e&s;pecially, of &s;uch as keep the Money of
their Dominions at Home, and on the con|trary,
for prohibiting the Importation from
Abroad, of &s;uch Things as are the Product
of other Countries, and of the Labour of
other People, as which carry Money back
in Return, and not Merchandize in Ex|change.</P>
<P>NOR can we wonder that we &s;ee &s;uch
Princes and States endeavouring to &s;et up
<PB N="55" REF="83">
&s;uch Manufactures in their own Countries,
which they &s;ee are &s;ucce&s;sfully and profita|bly
carried on by their Neighbours, and to
endeavour to procure the Materials proper
for &s;etting up tho&s;e Manufactures by all
ju&s;t and po&s;&s;ible Methods from other Coun|tries.</P>
<P>HENCE we cannot blame the <HI>French</HI>
or <HI>Germans</HI> for endeavouring to get over
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Wool into their Hands, by the
help of which they may bring their People
to imitate our Manufactures, which are &s;o
e&s;teem'd in the World, as well as &s;o gain|full
at Home.</P>
<P>NOR can we blame any foreign Nation
for prohibiting the U&s;e and Wearing of
our Manufacture, if they can either make
them at Home, or make any which they
can &s;hift with in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on is plain; 'tis the Intere&s;t of
every Nation to encourage their own Trade,
to encourage tho&s;e Manufactures that will
employ their own Subjects, con&s;ume their
own Growth of Provi&s;ions, as well as Ma|terials
of Commerce, and &s;uch as will keep
their Money or Species at Home.</P>
<P>'TIS from this ju&s;t Principle, that the
<HI>French</HI> prohibit the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manu|facture,
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> again prohibit or
impo&s;e a Tax equal to a Prohibition, on the
<HI>French</HI> Silks, Paper, Linen, and &s;everal others
of their Manufactures. 'Tis from the &s;ame
ju&s;t Rea&s;on in Trade, that we prohibit the
<PB N="56" REF="84">
wearing of <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> wrought Silks,
painted Callicoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that we prohibit the
Importation of <HI>French</HI> Brandy, <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> Su|gars,
and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tobacco; and &s;o of &s;eve|ral
other Things.</P>
<P>I remember a Story told me by a Gen|tleman
who liv'd many Years in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
where as weak and &s;ordid a Nation as the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> were, and how gro&s;s &s;oever in their
Politicks; yet this Principle prevailed with
them, as the Re&s;ult of meer Nature in
Trade: The Ca&s;e was thus;</P>
<P>AN <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man who had lived long in
the City of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> upon the <HI>Wolga,</HI> and was
it &s;eems concern'd in the great Salt Mines
there, had ob&s;erv'd with Regret, the great
va&s;t Luggage Boats, as we might call them,
and which he call'd <HI>Ballatoons,</HI> carrying
Goods by the River from <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> and
from the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and perhaps from
<HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Mu&s;cow;</HI> the&s;e Boats as the Re|later
told me, carry'd a prodigious Burthen,
from 100 Ton, to near twice as much;
but were unwieldy, heavy, ungovern'd
Things, and requir'd as they might well
do, a great many Hands to guide, and per|haps
to tow them up again&s;t the Stream of
that mighty River, and the Di&s;tance being
above 1800 Miles too, they were in Pro|portion
a long Time on the Voyage.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man fancy'd with him&s;elf,
that he could contrive a kind of Ve&s;&s;el,
that tho' it &s;hould not carry quite &s;o much
<PB N="57" REF="85">
Burthen, &s;hould yet carry near 100 Ton,
and &s;hould, by the help of Sails and good
Management, perform the Voyage in much
&s;horter Time, and with much fewer
People.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THOSE Ballatoons it &s;eems had
each 100 to 110 or 120 Men em|ploy'd
in them to drag them along;
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man propo&s;ed to do
the &s;ame Work with 18 or 20 Men,
and perform the Voyage in about one
third of the Time.</P>
<P>BIG with this Project, and expecting to be
very well accepted at Court, and rewarded
too, away goes the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man to <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI>
where after &s;ome Attendance, and making
known to &s;ome of the Boyars and great
Men, that he had a Propo&s;al to make to
the Great Duke, that would be very much
to the Advantage of their Country, and for
the Advantage of the capital City, and the
like, he obtained Audience, and lay'd the
whole Scheme before his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE Grand Duke, for they did not then
call him Emperor, took the Thing very
readily, and at the &s;econd and third Au|dience,
called him to him, and began to
que&s;tion him about &s;everal Particulars, but
chiefly this: How many Men were employ|ed
in the&s;e Boats before? And the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Man an&s;wer'd, 120.</P>
<P>AND how many will you perform it
with &s;ays the Grand Duke.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="86">
EIGHTEEN or twenty Men at mo&s;t,
&s;ays the Projector.</P>
<P>AND how long Time are my Subjects
performing the Voyage now? Says his
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>ABOUT four or five Months, &s;ays the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man.</P>
<P>AND how long will you perform it in?
Says his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>IN about two Months, &s;ays the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Man.</P>
<P>UPON this the Great Duke &s;top'd, and
look'd angrily; but &s;eem'd to be mu&s;ing,
as if he was calculating the Thing; after
&s;ome Pau&s;e, he turns to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man,
And what Country Man are you? Says
his Ducal Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>AN <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, &s;ays the Projector.</P>
<P>VERY well &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, 'tis well for
you, that you are not one of my Subjects;
do you come hither to &s;et up Projects, to
&s;tarve my People? Get you gone forthwith,
and with the utmo&s;t Expedition out of
my Dominions upon pain of Death: You
perform that Work with eighteen Men,
which now one hundred and twenty Men
are employ'd, and get their Bread by!
What mu&s;t the hundred and two Men do,
that are to be turn'd out of their Bu&s;ine&s;s!
Mu&s;t they peri&s;h and be &s;tarv'd for want of
Employment! Get you gone, adds his Ma|je&s;ty,
and &s;ee my Court no more; and im|mediately
gave Orders for having him car|ry'd
<PB N="59" REF="87">
away directly to <HI>Novogorod,</HI> on the
Frontiers of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> towards <HI>Livonia</HI> and
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Dominions, le&s;t he &s;hould pro|pagate
&s;uch dangerous Inventions, as &s;hould
le&s;&s;en the Employment and Labour of his
Subjects.</P>
<P>THE Folly of this Conduct makes a kind
of Je&s;t upon the People of <HI>Mo&s;cow;</HI> but
the Moral of the Fable, be it &s;o or not, is
good; 'tis certainly the Wealth and Felicity
of a Nation, to have the People fully em|ploy'd
for Wages, let that Wages be what
it will.</P>
<P>BY the &s;ame Rule, tho&s;e Nations are the
riche&s;t and wealthie&s;t, as well in general
as in particular, where the Labour of the
People, without Injury to the Government,
brings the mo&s;t Money for their Work.</P>
<P>IT is certainly a wrong Maxim which
&s;ome People dogmatize &s;o very much upon,
<HI>viz.</HI> that it is the general Intere&s;t of this
Nation to reduce the Price of their Manu|facture.</P>
<P>IT is true, there are &s;ome old Noti|ons
which chime in with this Piece of tra|ding
Policy, <HI>viz.</HI> that Cheapne&s;s cau&s;es
Con&s;umption; and that by under&s;elling o|ther
Nations, we &s;hall carry away the Trade
from them; and there is &s;omething popular
in the Notion too: But it will not hold
in all Ca&s;es, and particularly not in our
Manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="88">
FIRST, I in&s;i&s;t, that if you would re|duce
the Price of our Manufacture, by re|ducing
the Wages of the Poor, who are
the Workers or Manufacturers, it is not
po&s;&s;ible but that you will reduce the Value
and Goodne&s;s of the Manufacture.</P>
<P>IF you expect the Poor &s;hould work
cheaper, and not perform their Work &s;light|er
and more overly, as we call it, and &s;uper|ficially,
you expect what is not in the Na|ture
of the Thing.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if you lower the Wages of the
Poor, you mu&s;t of Cour&s;e &s;ink the Rate of
Provi&s;ions, and that of Cour&s;e will &s;ink the
Value of Lands, and &s;o you wound the
Capital at once; for the Poor cannot earn
little and &s;pend much, the End of that is,
&s;tarving and mi&s;ery; the Rate of Provi&s;ions
will follow the Rate of Wages, there is no
po&s;&s;ibility of its being otherwi&s;e; it has
ever been &s;o, and ever will be &s;o, the Na|ture
of the Thing requires it.</P>
<P>THIS therefore is beginning at the wrong
End of Trade; but the true Way is, keep
up the Goodne&s;s of your Manufacture, &s;o
as to make it excel in Quality, and its ex|ceeding
in Price will be no Deficiency in
Trade.</P>
<P>THINGS are not dear or cheap, accord|ing
as they &s;ell for more or le&s;s; but accord|ing
as the Price they &s;ell for, bears a Pro|portion
to the goodne&s;s or meanne&s;s of the
Goods &s;old. A high priz'd Manufacture
<PB N="61" REF="89">
may be as cheap, as a low priz'd Manufac|ture
of the &s;ame Kind, according to the
well or ill performing and fini&s;hing the
Work; as a fine Piece of Painting may be
cheaper than a coar&s;er Piece of the &s;ame
Dimen&s;ions, in Proportion to the Goodne&s;s
of its Workman&s;hip; tho' one &s;hould be
&s;old for one hundred Guineas, and the other
for one hundred Shillings.</P>
<P>LET your Manufacture gain the Credit
of the be&s;t in the World of its Kind, it
&s;hall accordingly bear the be&s;t Price of any
in the World, and yet be cheap too; that
is, it &s;hall be cheap of the Price, tho' not
under Price.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak more of this in its Place;
'tis only hinted &s;uperficially here, to argue
the great Advantage to a Nation, of having
&s;uch an Employment for their Poor, as
may make them not live only, but live
comfortably. The poor <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Wretch|es
who mann'd the Ballatoon with one
hundred and twenty Men, liv'd on that
Employ; that is to &s;ay, they did not im|mediately
peri&s;h; but the Truth is, they
might be &s;aid to &s;tarve at it, not live at it.</P>
<P>BUT our labouring Poor really live, keep
Families, pay Taxes, Scot and Lot, as we
call it, wear good Cloths, eat the Fat, and
drink the Sweet; and yet, labour hard too.
And this is not only the Glory of Trade
in general, but of our Manufacture in par|ticular;
nay, and is the Support of the
<PB N="62" REF="90">
Manufacture too; for by this means, the
Manufacture is kept up to its Price at Mar|ket;
the Goodne&s;s being kept up at Home,
the Credit of it is kept up Abroad, and one
reciprocally is the Life of the other; the
Wages &s;upport the Manufacture, and the
Manufacture &s;upports the Wages; by the
good Pay, the Weaver and all his Depen|dent
Trade&s;men are encourag'd to make
the Wares good, by the Goodne&s;s their
Credit Abroad is kept up, by the Credit
the Price, and by that Price the Wages;
<HI>one Hand</HI> wa&s;hes <HI>t'other Hand,</HI> and both
the <HI>Hands</HI> the <HI>Face.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE I in&s;i&s;t al&s;o, that our Manufac|ture
is the cheape&s;t in the World, becau&s;e
it is the be&s;t; and our Poor work as cheap
as any Poor in <HI>Europe,</HI> becau&s;e their Work
is be&s;t perform'd: And this I &s;hall prove
more particularly as I go on.</P>
<P>LET us therefore cea&s;e tho&s;e narrow No|tions
in Commerce, or at lea&s;t lay le&s;s
Stre&s;s upon them; that Cheapne&s;s cau&s;es
Con&s;umption, may be allow'd in many
Things; but 'tis not a Rule without Ex|ception,
nor a Foundation to build upon in
every Ca&s;e; it is true, in the Con&s;umption
of Tra&s;h, and in the Con&s;umption of Eat|ables
and Drinkables: If good Wine was
to be &s;old at &s;ix Pence a Quart, in&s;tead of
two Shillings, or at three Pence a Pot, as
&s;trong Beer, there would be much more
Wine drank than is now; but in Things of
<PB N="63" REF="91">
Sub&s;tance, weighty and durable, the Ca&s;e
many times alters, and it is a true old Pro|verb,
<HI>the be&s;t is be&s;t cheap.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER is it true in every Article, that
the Con&s;umption of Quantity is the Pro&s;|perity
of Trade, unle&s;s it be al&s;o true, that
&s;ome Gain is made by the Trade: For
Example, when our Gold Coin in <HI>England,</HI>
was with the greate&s;t Infatuation imagina|ble,
advanc'd from twenty one Shillings and
&s;ix Pence, to thirty Shillings each Guinea,
the &s;ame Price being not in Proportion
rai&s;ed in foreign Countries, the <HI>Dutch,
Germans, French,</HI> and <HI>Portugueze,</HI> hurry'd
over their Gold hither, coin'd it at forty
<HI>per Cent.</HI> Profit, and immediately ve&s;ted it
in our Produce and Manufacture. Had
they gone on thus, and bought all the
Woollen Goods, Corn, Tin, Lead, wrought
Iron and Bra&s;s, Sugar and Tobacco in
<HI>England,</HI> as they would &s;oon ha' done
wich Gold at &s;ix Pound an Ounce, that
Con&s;umption of Quantity would ha' ruin'd
the whole Commerce; for they would
have &s;tagnated all our Markets Abroad, be|ing
able to &s;ell twenty or thirty <HI>per Cent.</HI>
cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, they
would in &s;hort have carried away all our
Quantity, and le&s;t us full of Gold, at a
third of Price more than it was worth.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all; neither may the carry|ing
of the Quantity of our Goods be always
a Benefit, if the Price &s;hould be reduc'd be|low
<PB N="64" REF="92">
low the Standard of our Trade: By the
Standard of our Trade, I mean, the &s;tated
ordinary Rate of the Poors Labour. What
Benefit is a great Con&s;umption of your
Goods, at a Rate with which the Mer|chant
cannot gain, and the Maker cannot
live? There is no Que&s;tion, but you may
&s;ell all the woollen Manufacture at this
Time in the Nation, in three Months
Time, if you will give them at an Abate|ment
of twenty to thirty per Cent, upon
the Value; and &s;o the Cheapne&s;s will cer|tainly
cau&s;e the Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>But what Gain would this be to the
Commerce, and what Advantage to the
Trade in general? Since you cannot re|place
the Quantity at that Price, and you
cannot hold the Trade upon that Foot
without falling into Circum&s;tances as rui|nous
to Trade, as want of a Market;
namely, the finking Wages, &s;inking Provi|&s;ions,
and &s;inking Land; which, in a word,
is a <HI>&s;inking Fund</HI> in the literal Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>A much better Way to &s;upport Trade,
is to &s;ink your Quantity at Home, pro|portioning
the Quantity to the Con&s;ump|tion,
if you cannot proportion the Con|&s;umption
to the Quantity; and you had
much better have tome of your People
want Work, and &s;eek Employment &s;ome
other Way, than to have all Hands at
Work to no Profit: Of which al&s;o I &s;hall
&s;peak fully and at large in its Order.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="93">
Upon the whole, I in&s;i&s;t, and doubt not
to make it appear, (without any Impeach|ment
of the old popular Notion, of Cheap|ne&s;s
cau&s;ing Con&s;umption;) That it is the
true Intere&s;t of any Trading People to keep
lip the Value, I mean the intrin&s;ic Goodne&s;s
of their Manufactures, to their ju&s;t Standard;
and make them cheap by their real Worth,
rather than by meer lowering the Price at
the Expence of their Credit, and meerly to
bring them to a low Rate at the Market.</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t, that this keeping up the Cre|dit
of a Manufacture, by its intrin&s;ic
Worth, is the only Prosperity of a nation|al
Production, by which the People that
make it are enrich'd, and the Nation they
live in made prosperous and powerful.</P>
<P>IT is apparent in the Manufactures of
<HI>China, India</HI> and other Ea&s;tern Countries,
they have, it is true, the mo&s;t extended Ma|nufacture,
and the greate&s;t Variety in the
World; and their Manufactures pu&s;h them|&s;elves
upon the World, by the meer Stre&s;s
of their Cheapness, which according to the
Principle mentioned above, cau&s;es their
Consumption.</P>
<P>BUT then look back to the Country or
Countries from whence they come, and
there you &s;ee the Con&s;equence most evi|dent;
the People who make all the&s;e &s;ine
Works are to the lair Degree mi&s;erable, their
Labour of no Value, their Wages would
fright us to talk of it, and their way of Li|ving
<PB N="66" REF="94">
rai&s;e a Horror in us to think of it:
Their Women draw the Plough in&s;tead of
Hor&s;es; their Men peri&s;h and &s;ink under the
Weight of their heavier Labour, becau&s;e the
Food they eat is not of &s;ufficient Nouri&s;h|ment
to &s;upport them, and the Wages they
get cannot provide better Food for them;
and yet their rigorous Task-ma&s;ters la&s;h them
forward as we (cruelly too) &s;ometimes do
our Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>MONS. <HI>Niuenhoff</HI> in his De&s;cription of
<HI>China</HI> gives &s;uch an Account of the Mi&s;ery of
the poor People dragging, or as we call it, tow|ing
the Boats up the Stream of the royal Canal
there, the greate&s;t in the World; and how
their Drivers, like our Carters, whip them
on till the poor exhau&s;ted Creatures drop
down and die under the Labour of it: I
&s;ay, he gives &s;uch an Account as would
make the Heart of a merciful Man bleed to
think of it; and the utmo&s;t of their Wages
for all this Labour does not, as I can calcu|late
it, amount to &s;o much as 2 <HI>d.</HI> a Day
<HI>Sterling</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and the like no doubt
is the Ca&s;e in their Manufacture in Pro|portion.</P>
<P>IF then the&s;e Gentlemen, who are for
forcing the Con&s;umption of our Manufac|ture
in <HI>England,</HI> (or in any of tho&s;e Coun|tries
in <HI>Europe</HI> where they work cheape&s;t,)
by their meer Cheapne&s;s, are content to re|duce
the Wages of the People that make
them, to the Rate of tho&s;e in <HI>China</HI> or in
<PB N="67" REF="95">
<HI>India,</HI> there is no doubt they might en|crea&s;e
the Con&s;umption, and &s;ell off the
Quantity; but what would be the Advan|tage?
They would &s;ell their Goods and ruin
their People; the Benefit of which in the
Gro&s;s, I confe&s;s I do not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak of all this again, as it more
particularly relates to our Commerce in
<HI>England;</HI> and therefore I only mention it
here, as this Notion of reducing the Price
of the Manufacture is received, for a ge|neral
Principle in Commerce, and apply'd
by Mi&s;take to particular Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>THERE is an Exception in the Article of
Wages, which may be brought here again&s;t
what I have advanc'd above as to <HI>England,</HI>
viz. that we give the highe&s;t Wages to our
Poor, of any Nation in the World; and
it may be thought I have either for|got,
or am ignorant of the high Wages
given in the <HI>European</HI> Colonies in Ame|rica
as well <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as <HI>French, Spani&s;h, &amp;c.</HI>
where a Piece of Eight, or rather five
Shillings, and in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> &s;ix to &s;even
Shillings <HI>per</HI> Day, is given to Handicrafts,
and labouring People for their Work; and
where the Price of Slaves is ri&s;en within
the&s;e few Years, from twenty Pound a
Head, to thirty and forty Pound, on the
meer Account of the Dearne&s;s of Wages.</P>
<P>But this is explain'd, and fully an&s;wer|ed
in few Words; namely, that the Dear|ne&s;s
of Wages there, is occa&s;ioned by two

Provi&s;ions in the I&s;lands, and the want
of People in the Colonies on the Conti|nent;
and let any Man of Experience cal|culate
the Proportion of tho&s;e Things,
and he will find that in a due Equality or
Proportion to the Dearne&s;s of Living, the
Wages are as cheap there as here, and in
&s;ome Articles rather cheaper; the parti|cular
Examination of it, I refer to its pro|per
Place.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, to &s;um it up in a few
Words, Trade is the Wealth of the World;
Trade makes the Difference as to Rich
or Poor, between one Nation and another;
Trade nouri&s;hes Indu&s;try, and Indu&s;try
begets Trade; Trade di&s;per&s;es the natural

be plea&s;ant; to have nothing to do, is all
Dejection, di&s;piriting, and in a word, to be

<HEAD>OF THE

ENGLAND
IN PARTICULAR.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN I &s;peak of the Trade of
<HI>England</HI> in particular, as in the
Title of this Chapter, I claim to
to be under&s;tood, not in too nar|row
and confin'd a Sen&s;e, as if I meant it
meerly of <HI>England</HI> ab&s;tracted; limited to
its geographical Dimen&s;ions, and that little
Spot within the Lines of its Situation, as it
appears on the Surface of the Globe, which
is little indeed.</P>
<P>BUT I am to he under&s;tood in the Lan|guage
of Trade; and &s;o the Trade, of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
is the Trade of all the Places within
the Dominions of <HI>England;</HI> or, as it is u&s;u|ally
<PB N="71" REF="101">
expre&s;s'd, the Countries &s;ubject to the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government.</P>
<P>I am not at all fond of that modern a&s;|&s;um'd
Stile, by which &s;ome Authors think
they do us an Honour, when they call
the extended &s;cattered Colonies and Do|minions
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation,
<HI>the Engli&s;h Empire:</HI> I don't think they
do His Maje&s;ty or the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation any
Honour at all by it; 'tis enough the King
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has the Opulence of an
Emperor, without affecting or at all valu|ing
the Title.</P>
<P>NOT but that as the Humour of the
World goes, I believe in a few Ages more
all Degrees of Men, or at lea&s;t many of
them, will advance their Plumes, and
cock their Feathers, in proportion as their
Pride increa&s;es, in all the Nations about us,
and that as the Counts and Princes are in|crea&s;ed
in &s;everal Nations already, even to
a Scandal; &s;o they will go on.</P>
<P>THUS in Time the Counts may be Dukes,
the Dukes Princes, the Princes be Kings,
and the Kings Emperors; in a Word, 'tis
not improper, as we are talking of Trade,
to ob&s;erve how Honour is become a Mer|chandize,
Nobility grows cheap, and Dig|nities
come to Market upon ea&s;y Terms in
the World; and what with the Church
Politicks on one Hand, and State Politicks
on the other, the World may in a few
Years be overrun, not with real Honours,
<PB N="72" REF="102">
but with Titles. Honour blooms and runs
to Seed; (I mean Abroad, not in <HI>England</HI>)
and Titles without Merit are the Scandal
of the World. But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>BUT I return, The Trade of <HI>England, I
&s;ay,</HI> is the Trade of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dominions,
the Commerce of the Countries &s;ubject
to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, particularly,
<HI>1&s;t,</HI> The Trade of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ire|land.</HI>
And, <HI>2dly,</HI> The Trade of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Colonies and Factories in <HI>America, A&s;ia,</HI>
and <HI>Africa;</HI> The&s;e all put together, make
the Trade of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I come to &s;peak of the general
Commerce of the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> in
other Countries, where they are &s;aid to
trade as Merchants, not to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of
the Country in Sovereignty; that is quite
another Thing, and will be di&s;cour&s;ed of in
another Manner, for we mu&s;t always di|&s;tingui&s;h
between the Trade of a Country,
and the Dealings of the People, by Corre|&s;pondence
in other Countries; and I &s;hall
take Care to pre&s;erve that Di&s;tinction, as
Ju&s;tice requires, on all Occa&s;ions as we
go on.</P>
<P>THE Trade of <HI>England</HI> is one Thing,
the Trade of the <HI>Engli&s;h People</HI> is another;
the fir&s;t is confin'd to the Place, the &s;econd
is carried on by the Per&s;ons; however, and
wherever they may be &s;cattered, removed,
and by Indu&s;try &s;ettled, as Occa&s;ion di|rects,
<PB N="73" REF="103">
in any or every Part and Country of
the known World.</P>
<P>IT is true the Greatne&s;s and Opulence
of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as a trading Nation, is very
con&s;picuous on this very Account, <HI>viz.</HI>
that not only the Merchandize, but the
Merchants al&s;o of our Nation, are found
in all the trading Parts and Ports of the
known World; and which is &s;till more,
they are placed there, and &s;upported by the
Strength of their own Stocks, and the
Value of the Merchandizes they carry
thither, more than of the Goods they buy
there.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome parts of the World, indeed, they
&s;eem to be &s;ettled and employed rather <HI>to
buy,</HI> than <HI>to &s;ell;</HI> as in the &s;everal Factories
and trading Ports of <HI>India,</HI> at <HI>Mocha,</HI> at
<HI>Suratte,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Bengale,</HI> and all the
Coa&s;ts of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>China;</HI> but in mo&s;t of
the other Parts of the World, we rather
<HI>&s;ell</HI> than <HI>buy;</HI> at lea&s;t we trade equally both
Ways, to the great Advantage of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Commerce in general, and of the Mer|chants
in particular; as in <HI>Turky, Italy,
Spain,</HI> the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and the
Kingdom of <HI>Portugal;</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
<HI>German,</HI> and the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts, the <HI>Bal|tick,</HI>
and <HI>Northern</HI> Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IN all the&s;e Countries, the Growth and
Product of our Lands and Seas, as mentio|ned
already, and the Labour and Manu|facture
of our People are the principal
<PB N="74" REF="104">
Subject of our Merchants Bu&s;ine&s;s; and
what <HI>they buy</HI> in tho&s;e Countries is the
Return only, or rather in Part of the Re|turn
for tho&s;e Goods, which to our great
Advantage they fir&s;t carried thither, and
&s;old in tho&s;e Markets; the Overplus or
Ballance being made good, according to
the Nature of Things, and of the Country,
&s;everal Ways; &s;ome by Exchanges, &s;ome
in Specie, &s;ome directly, &s;ome from one
Country to another, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its
Place.</P>
<P>BUT the Trade of <HI>England</HI> in particular,
as di&s;tingui&s;h'd above, and as we are to
&s;peak of it under the Title <HI>of the Engli&s;h
Commerce,</HI> is contain'd in the&s;e Generals.</P>
<P>1. THE Product and Manufacture of
the Country, for Exportation into foreign
Parts only.</P>
<P>2. THE Shipping and Navigation.</P>
<P>3. THE Home Con&s;umption of our own
Goods, and foreign Importations.</P>
<P>4. THE Employment of the People in
Con&s;equence of all the&s;e, and in the parti|cular
Works for the Management of them.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e four Heads, what an im|men&s;e
Weight of Bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on, or,
as it is ordinarily expre&s;s'd, is managed in
this Kingdom? How many Millions of
People are kept in con&s;tant Motion, Men,
Women, and Children employ'd, Infants
(&s;o they may properly be called) of five,
&s;ix and &s;even Years of Age, made capable
<PB N="75" REF="105">
of getting their own Bread, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
by the Labour of their own Hands, and a
prodigious Wealth, accumulated among
the common People? in&s;omuch, that if
it were ca&s;t up together, the Poor, that is
to &s;ay, &s;uch as were formerly counted a|mong
the Poor, I mean the Trade&s;men,
the Shopkeeping, trading and labouring
Part of the People, have more real movable
Wealth among them, than all the Gentry
and Nobility in the whole Kingdom, not
reckoning the real E&s;tates in Lands, Tene|ments,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which they po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ur|prizing
Share al&s;o.</P>
<P>AND here it is worth our making a Stop,
and reflecting a little on a mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable
Incident, in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, and
which is to be parallel'd in no Place
that I know of in the World; namely that
the Fund of our Trade in <HI>England</HI> is rai&s;ed
wholly within it &s;elf; it is a Kind of Pecu|liar
to us, that all our Commerce is deriv'd
from our &s;elves: It is not &s;o in other Nati|ions;
the Trade of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> is all exo|tick;
it con&s;i&s;ts in meer Buying and Selling,
Fetching and Carrying, and they export
little or nothing, but what they fir&s;t im|port;
even the Linnen which they are laid
to make, they import mo&s;t of the Yarn (for
it) from <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> and the Flax
for the re&s;t from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> buy to &s;ell, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
plant, dig, &s;heer, and weave to &s;ell; not
<PB N="76" REF="106">
only our Manufactures are our own, but
almo&s;t all the Materials of them are our
own; I &s;ay almo&s;t, becau&s;e there are &s;ome
Exceptions, but they are not many.</P>
<P>IN our Manufacture of Wool, all the
Materials are our own, but the Oyl, and
&s;ome dye Stuffs, &s;uch as the Galls, the In|digo,
the Cocheneal, and a few others; as
to <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool, it is an Extra, 'tis a
Step out of the ordinary Way; mo&s;t of our
Manufactures are, <HI>and might be,</HI> made with|out
it.</P>
<P>IN our Manufacture of <HI>Hard Ware,</HI> the
Tin, the Lead, is our own; the Copper,
and Iron are our own, except a part of the
Iron from <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and but a part:
For in the Gro&s;s, and in all our Founda|ries
of Iron, the Metal is our own.</P>
<P>IN our Manufacture of Silk, it is true, the
grand and fundamental Materials are foreign.
But then, 1. The Silk Manufactures are but
of late called our own; it is an Improve|ment,
and it is within the Reach of our
Memory, that we bought all our wrought
Silks, a few Ribbands excepted, from Abroad,
to the Value of near two Millions a Year;
and it may not be long before an improving
Nation, as we are, may rai&s;e the Silk at Home
too, or at lea&s;t in our Colonies, as well as
other Countries have done, which had none
before, <HI>viz. France, Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain:</HI> For 'tis
well known, that <HI>Italy</HI> at fir&s;t, and <HI>France</HI>
but lately, had no Silk of their own, but
<PB N="77" REF="107">
brought it all from <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>India:</HI> As to
our Product for Exportation, 'tis all our
own, or of our Colonies, which is the &s;ame
thing, &s;uch as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Corn,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Coal,</ITEM>

<ITEM>Indigo, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THESE as Exportations, being all our
own, and being in them&s;elves &s;o va&s;tly
great, are the Fund of our Wealth, and
the Encrea&s;e of our Numbers.</P>
<P>A People numerous and rich, nece&s;&s;arily
make a great Home Con&s;umption, as well
of their own Growth, as of foreign Impor|tations:
And this is the Sum of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Trade.</P>
<P>IT is no Boa&s;t, much le&s;s is it a&s;&s;uming
to &s;ay, that we con&s;ume at Home the grea|te&s;t
Quantity of Foreign Product, but the
lea&s;t of Foreign Manufacture of any tra|ding
Nation in the World; the only foreign
Manufactures we may be &s;aid to import
wholly, is Linen and Paper, and Tin Plates;
and yet tho&s;e not wholly neither, tho' 'tis
acknowledged they are chiefly imported.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> imports the Manufactures of other
Countries more than we, but very little of
their Growth and Produce, except Fi&s;h;
the like is &s;aid of <HI>France,</HI> tho' they have
<PB N="78" REF="108">
now &s;o great a Share of Manufacture of
their own.</P>
<P>WE import Gold, Silver, Wine, Brandy,
Hemp, Pitch, Tar, Flax, Wax, Oyl, Iron,
Steel, Fruit, Wool, Silk, Hair, Drugs, Dye
Suffs, Salt-Peter, Tea, Coffee, Timber, Spice:
All the&s;e and many more. But the&s;e are all
the <HI>Growth</HI> and <HI>Produce</HI> of the Lands, not
the Manufacture and Workman&s;hip of fo|reign
Countries: And all the&s;e we con&s;ume
at Home in &s;uch Quantities, as are not to be
equalled in any other Country.</P>
<P>But of the Manufacture of other Coun|tries,
we import very little, Linen ex|cepted,
Paper and Tin-Plates; and of all
the&s;e, except Tin-Plates we make now great
Quantities at Home al&s;o: The Con&s;ump|tion
of Wine and Linen in <HI>England</HI> is pro|digious,
and we import more than any &s;ingle
Nation in the World, notwith&s;tanding a
very great Quantity of the fir&s;t made at Home
e&s;pecially in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> as for
Ea&s;t <HI>India</HI> Manufactures, the Quantity now
con&s;um'd in <HI>England</HI> is &s;mall, and tho&s;e that
are, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>Callicoes</HI> may be e&s;teem'd as
Linen, being of the &s;ame Species as to their
U&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT to bring it back to the fir&s;t Head as
a Trade, the Trade of <HI>England</HI> con&s;i&s;ts then
in &s;hort,
<Q><PB N="79" REF="109">
Of the greate&s;t Inland Pro|duction
Exported, and the
greate&s;t foreign Production
imported
of any Na|tion
in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Exportation lays in a Stock of
Wealth from Abroad, multiplies and en|riches
our People, and our People in gene|ral
being in good Circum&s;tances, I mean the
middling, trading, and indu&s;trious People,
living tolerably well, their well-faring gives
Occa&s;ion to the va&s;t Con&s;umption of the
foreign, as well as home Produce, the like
of which is not to be equalled by any Nation
in the World; the Particulars we &s;hall en|quire
into in their Order.</P>
<P>HOW far the Multitudes of our People
are encrea&s;ed by the&s;e very Articles, and
that to &s;uch a Degree as is &s;carce conceiv|able,
is worth our Enquiry, were it not too
tedious for this Place. What populous Towns
are rais'd by our Manufactures, from within
few Years! how are our Towns built into
Cities, and &s;mall Villages (hardly known in
ancient Times) grown up into populous
Towns! Let any one that is curious in &s;uch.
Ob&s;ervations, take notice of the manufactu|ring
Counties
and Towns, the Sea Ports,
and the Coa&s;t Counties, and compare
them with the Counties where there are
no Manufactures carried on, and where
there being no part of the Land bordering
<PB N="80" REF="110">
on the Sea, the Encrea&s;e of Trade could
not have that immediate Influence on them;
and let them but ob&s;erve the Difference be|tween
the&s;e in the Numbers of great and
populous Towns, the Throngs and Multi|tudes
of People, and the &s;till encrea&s;ing
Greatne&s;s of the Towns that were larger
before.</P>
<P>LET them &s;ee how the People gather
about the Manufacture, how they crowd
into the clothing Countries, however barren
and remote: And on the contrary, how
thin of Inhabitants, compared to tho&s;e po|pulous
Parts, tho' otherwi&s;e populous too,
are the other Parts of the Country; &s;ome of
which are much more fruitful and fertile,
the Soil richer, the Situation more agree|able,
and the Air milder and whol&s;omer
than tho&s;e that are &s;o populous? But where
the Trade is, there are the People, there
the Wealth, there the great Markets, and the
large Towns; and in a Word, there the ready
Money: For it is the Trade that has made
the common People rich, as Pride has made
the Gentry poor.</P>
<P>WELL might I &s;ay, as in the foregoing
Chapter, That it is a Scandal upon the Un|der&s;tanding
of the Gentry, to think con|temptibly
of the trading part of the Nation;
&s;eeing however the Gentlemen may value
them&s;elves upon their Birth and Blood, the
Ca&s;e begins to turn again&s;t them &s;o evi|dently,
as to Fortune and E&s;tate, that tho'
<PB N="81" REF="111">
they &s;ay, the Trade&s;men cannot be made
Gentlemen; yet the Trade&s;men are, at this
Time, able to buy the Gentlemen almo&s;t in
every part of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>AND let me add, were it not for two
Articles, by which the Numbers of the Fa|milies
of Gentlemen are recruited when
le&s;&s;ened by Fate and Folly, and re&s;tored
when &s;unk and decayed, and both by Trade,
this Nation would, in a few Years, have
very few Families of Gentlemen left; or,
at lea&s;t, very few that had E&s;tates to &s;up|port
them.</P>
<P>1. THE ancient Families, who having
wa&s;ted and exhau&s;ted their E&s;tates, and be|ing
declin'd and decay'd in Fortune by
Luxury and high Living, have re&s;tor'd and
rais'd them&s;elves again, by mixing Blood
with the de&s;pis'd Trade&s;men, marrying the
Daughters of &s;uch Trade&s;men, as being o|vergrown
in Wealth, have been oblig'd, for
want of Sons, to leave their E&s;tates to their
Female I&s;&s;ue; we find innumerable Families
not of Gentlemen only, but even of the No|bility
of the highe&s;t Rank, have re&s;tor'd
their Fortunes by &s;uch Heire&s;&s;es, and by &s;uch
Matches, to the Degree of 50, to 100 and
150 Thou&s;and Pounds at a Time.</P>
<P>2. AS thus the decay'd E&s;tates of the
Nobility and Gentry have been re&s;tored,
and their Family Wounds heal'd by the
Daughters of the richer Trade&s;men; &s;o on
<PB N="82" REF="112">
the other Hand, by the Trade&s;men them|&s;elves,
or by their Sons, the Numbers of
the Families of the Gentry have been
recruited, when &s;unk quite out of Rank,
and lo&s;t in Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s:</P>
<P>FAMILIES are as effectually extinct,
and lo&s;t, and as much forgotten, when
the Heirs are left in Mi&s;ery and Po|verty,
and the E&s;tate &s;old from them,
as if they were &s;unk into the Grave. I
could in&s;tance at this Time, in a Family,
who once flouri&s;h'd within a few Miles of
this City, the elde&s;t Son a Baronet with|out
Bread, wears a red Coat without a
Commi&s;&s;ion, and goes in a di&s;gui&s;ed Name,
that he may not have a SIR tack'd upon his
Rags, and have his Honour be an Additi|on
to his Mi&s;ery: The Children that are
young, are kept upon Charity, and the
grown Daughters go to Service, from a
Coach and four Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>THE E&s;tate (of one thou&s;and eight hun|dred
Pound <HI>per Annum</HI>) is purcha&s;ed by a
Citizen, who having got the Money by
hone&s;t Indu&s;try, and per&s;uing a pro&s;perous
Trade, has left his Books and his Ware|hou&s;es
to his two younger Sons, is retir'd
from the World, lives upon the E&s;tate, is
a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and makes a compleat
Gentleman: His elde&s;t Son bred at the
Univer&s;ity, and thoroughly accompli&s;h'd,
is as well receiv'd among the Gentry in
the County, and upon the valuable Fund
<PB N="83" REF="113">
of his true Merit, as if he had been a Gen|tleman
by Blood for a hundred Generati|ons
before the Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>I might add here, that it would be worth
the while for tho&s;e Gentlemen, who talk &s;o
much of their antient Family Merit, and
look &s;o little at pre&s;erving the Stock, by
encrea&s;ing their own: I &s;ay, it would be
worth their while to look into the Roll
of our Gentry, and enquire what is be|come
of the E&s;tates of tho&s;e prodigious
Numbers of lo&s;t and extinct Families,
which now even the Heralds them&s;elves
can hardly find; let them tell us if tho&s;e
E&s;tates are not now purcha&s;ed by Trade&s;|men
and Citizens, or the Po&s;terity of &s;uch;
and whether tho&s;e Trade&s;mens Po&s;terity do
not now fill up the Vacancies, the Gaps,
and Cha&s;mes in the great Roll or Li&s;t of
Families, as well of the Gentry, as of the
Nobility them&s;elves; and whether there
are many Families left, who have not been
either re&s;tored <HI>as in our fir&s;t Head,</HI> or &s;up|ply'd,
<HI>as in the &s;econd,</HI> by a Succe&s;&s;ion of
Wealth, and new Branches from the grow|ing
Greatne&s;s of Trade.</P>
<P>TRADE, in a word, rai&s;es antient Fami|lies
when &s;unk and decay'd: And plants
new Families, where the old ones are lo&s;t
and extin&s;t.</P>
<P>I dare oblige my &s;elf to name five
hundred great E&s;tates, within one hun|dred
Miles of <HI>London,</HI> which within
<PB N="84" REF="114">
eighty Years pa&s;t, were the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
of the antient <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentry, which are
now bought up, and in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Citizens and Trade&s;men, purcha&s;ed fair|ly
by Money rai&s;ed in Trade; &s;ome by
Merchandizing, &s;ome by Shop-keeping,
and &s;ome by meer Manufacturing; &s;uch as
Clothing in particular, of which Sort,
notwith&s;tanding all that is, or has been &s;aid
of the Decay of our Manufacture, it is not
difficult to find in the clothing and manu|facturing
Countries of <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI>
many, (very many) Clothiers,
worth forty to fifty thou&s;and Pounds a
Man, and &s;ome of them worth from five
hundred to one thou&s;and Pound <HI>per An|num,</HI>
E&s;tates in Land, be&s;ides their Stock
in Bu&s;ine&s;s; who&s;e Po&s;terity will never be
reproach'd with their being up&s;tart Gen|tlemen,
or be thought Mechanick, for be|ing
of the Blood of a Clothier.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the populous Towns
rais'd by the&s;e Manufactures, let the curi|ous
examine the great Towns of
<LIST>
<ITEM>Manche&s;ter,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Warrington,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Macclesfield,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hallifax,</ITEM>

and many others.</P>

is the Country? <HI>not to &s;ay how rich;</HI>
how thick the Towns, how full the Mar|kets,
how &s;tor'd with People are the Vil|lages,
and even the open Country! in &s;o
much, that in the Pari&s;h or <HI>Vic$ridge</HI> of
<HI>Hallifax</HI> alone, they reckon up &s;ixteen
Chapels of Ea&s;e, and an hundred thou|&s;and
Communicants, be&s;ides fourteen or
fifteen Meeting-hou&s;es, the People of all
which live at large, &s;catter'd and &s;pread
over Hill and Dale, (for 'tis a mountainous
Country) as the Convenience of Water,
<PB N="88" REF="118">
Coal, and other Things proper to their
Manufacture obliges them; &s;o that the
whole Pari&s;h, which is a Circle of twelve
Miles diameter, is, as before, like a plant|ed
Garden, or a Colony where every Fami|ly
lives as it were within it &s;elf, and by it
&s;elf, for the propagating their Bu&s;ine&s;s;
and where, tho' the whole Country is in|finitely
populous, yet, if you pa&s;s in the
middle of the Day thro' the Villages, and
by the &s;traggling Hou&s;es on the Road, you
&s;hall hardly &s;ee any Body to ask the Way
of: But if you go in the Evening, after wor|king
Hours, you are &s;urpriz'd at the Mul|titude
of the People every where to be &s;een.</P>
<P>HAVING taken a View of the&s;e Countries,
let the &s;ame Per&s;on take a Tour through
tho&s;e few Counties in <HI>England,</HI> where
Trade has the lea&s;t Concern, and where
the Inhabitants con&s;i&s;t chiefly of Landlord
and Tenant, the Gentry and Husbandmen;
and tho' there you &s;ee no want of need|ful
People to cultivate the Ground, or to
di&s;patch the nece&s;&s;ary Labours of the Place;
yet the Face of Things differs extremely,
and the following Particulars di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>1. THE Market Towns are few and &s;mall,
compar'd with &s;uch as I have nam'd, and
compar'd with the general Bulk of the
&s;maller Towns, not fit to rank with tho&s;e
great ones nam'd; nay, the Villages in
tho&s;e manufacturing Countries, are equal
to the Market Towns in the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="119">
2. THE Villages are di&s;tant and remote,
&s;mall and thinly inhabited; and as for the
open Country, you &s;ee here and there a
Farm-hou&s;e, and a Cottage indeed, but
nothing like the numerous Dwellings which
&s;pread the enclo&s;ed Counties mention'd
above, and where the Roads as you travel
are like one continued Street, for &s;ome|times
twenty or thirty Miles together, and
full of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>3. IN the&s;e unemploy'd Counties, you
&s;ee the Women and Children idle, and out
of Bu&s;ine&s;s; the&s;e &s;itting at their Doors, and
tho&s;e playing in the Streets; even in the
Market Towns, and the mo&s;t populous Vil|lages,
where they might be &s;uppo&s;ed to
be employ'd, the Poor by the Rich, yet
there 'tis the &s;ame, much more in the
&s;ingle &s;cattering Villages, where they have
no Bu&s;ine&s;s but their own.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, in the manufacturing Coun|ties,
you &s;ee the Wheel going almo&s;t at
every Door, the Wool and the Yarn hang|ing
up at every Window; the Looms, the
Winders, the Combers, the Carders, the
Dyers, the Dre&s;&s;ers, all bu&s;y; and the very
Children, as well as Women, con&s;tantly
employ'd.</P>
<P>4. AS is the Labour, &s;o is the Living;
for where the Poor are full of Work,
they are never empty of Wages; they eat
while the others &s;tarve; and have a tole|rable
Plenty; while in the unemploy'd
<PB N="90" REF="120">
Counties it goes very hard with them:
And whence is all this? Look to the
Lands, and con&s;equently to the E&s;tates of
the Gentry, the manufacturing Counties
are calculated for Bu&s;ine&s;s, the unemploy'd
Counties for Plea&s;ure; the fir&s;t are throng'd
with Villages and great Towns, the la&s;t
with Parks and great Forre&s;ts; the fir&s;t are
&s;tored with People, the la&s;t with Game; the
fir&s;t are rich and fertil, the la&s;t wa&s;te and
barren; the diligent Part of the People are
fled to the fir&s;t, the idler Part are left at the
la&s;t; in a Word, the rich and thriving
Trade&s;men live in the fir&s;t, the decaying
wa&s;ting Gentry in the la&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Product of the fir&s;t, tho' improv'd
by Diligence and Application, is all con&s;u|med
among them&s;elves; the Product of
the la&s;t, tho' not half what it might be, is
carried away for want of Money to the
Markets of the fir&s;t; <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> eat the Fat
and the Kernel of all, and enjoy the Soft, be|ing
by their Diligence made able to buy it;
and <HI>the la&s;t</HI> eat the Husk, the cour&s;e, and
the hard; pinch, and live mi&s;erable, being
without Employment, except meer Drudg|ing,
and con&s;equently without Money.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on of the Thing an&s;wers for
it &s;elf; a poor labouring Man that goes a|broad
to his Day Work, and Husbandry,
Hedging, Ditching, Thre&s;hing, Carting,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and brings home his Week's Wages,
&s;uppo&s;e at eight Pence to twelve Pence a
<PB N="91" REF="121">
Day, or in &s;ome Counties le&s;s; if he has
a Wife and three or four Children to feed,
and who get little or nothing for them|&s;elves,
mu&s;t fare hard, and live poorly;
'tis ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e it mu&s;t be &s;o.</P>
<P>BUT if this Man's Wife and Children
can at the &s;ame Time get Employment, if
at next Door, or at the next Village
there lives a Clothier, or a Bay Maker, or
a Stuff or Drugget Weaver; the Manu|facturer
&s;ends the poor Woman comb'd
Wool, or carded Wool every Week to
&s;pin, and &s;he gets eight Pence or nine
Pence a Day at home; the Weaver &s;ends
for her two little Children, and they work
by the Loom, winding, filling Quills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and the two bigger Girls &s;pin at home with
their Mother, and the&s;e earn three Pence
or four Pence a Day each: So that put it
together, the Family at Home gets as
much as the Father gets Abroad, and ge|nerally
more.</P>
<P>THIS alters the Ca&s;e extremely, the Fa|mily
feels it, they all feed better, are
cloth'd warmer, and do not &s;o ea&s;ily nor
&s;o often fall into Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s; the
Father gets them Food, and the Mother
gets them Clothes; and as they grow,
they do not run away to be Footmen and
Soldiers, Thieves and Beggars, or &s;ell
them&s;elves to the Plantations, to avoid
the Goal and the Gallows, but have a
<PB N="92" REF="122">
Trade at their Hands, and every one can
get their Bread.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I once went through a large po|pulous
manufacturing Town in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and ob&s;erv'd, that an Officer
planted there, with a Serjeant and two
Drums, had been beating up a long
Time, and could get no Recruits, ex|cept
two or three Sots, who they had
drawn in to be drunk, and &s;o li&s;ted
when they were not them&s;elves, and
knew not what they did.</P>
<P>ENQUIRING the Rea&s;on of it, an
hone&s;t Clothier of the Town an&s;we|red
me effectually thus, <HI>The Ca&s;e is
plain,</HI> &s;ays he, thus, there is at this
Time a brisk Demand for Goods, we
have 1100 Looms, <HI>added he,</HI> in this
Town, and the Villages about it, and
not one of them want Work; and
there is not a poor Child in the
Town of above four Years old, but
can earn his own Bread; be&s;ides, there
being &s;o good a Trade at this Time,
cau&s;es us to advance Wages a little,
and the Weaver and the Spinner get
more than they u&s;ed to do; and
while it is &s;o, they may beat the Heads
of their Drums out, if they will,
they'll get no Soldiers here; but let
them come when Trade is dead, and
the People want Work, and they may
get Soldiers enough; the Gentleman
<PB N="93" REF="123">
Officer took the Hint, and went off
with his Drums, to try his Luck in
the Counties where there was no Ma|nufacture,
and there he pick'd up young
Fellows enough, where they were
Poor and Proud, Idle and Lazy, as
among the Farmers, Hor&s;e-Breakers,
Gentlemens Servants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Word, 'tis Poverty and Starving
that fills Armies, not Trade and Manu|facturing;
and therefore the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> and the
<HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the <HI>Lunen|burghers,</HI>
the <HI>He&s;&s;ians,</HI> and the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ians,</HI>
are glad when they hear the Drums beat,
and rejoice when other Nations will hire
their Troops, and entertain their Men for
Soldiers; for their Numbers are their Grie|vance:
And for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, the
<HI>Scots</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> are found di&s;per&s;ed
over all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and indeed
of the World, to &s;eek Employment, either
as Soldiers or Slaves (that is Servants)
merely for want of Entertainment at Home;
whereas on the other Hand, in <HI>England,</HI>
in <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Peo|ple
have Manufacturing, and are well em|ploy'd
at Home, nothing is more difficult
than to rai&s;e Men upon any extraordinary
Occa&s;ion; it was found &s;o here, in the
late War with <HI>France,</HI> after a few of the
fir&s;t Campaigns had carried off the loo&s;e
Fellows that a long Peace had left among
us; then they were oblig'd to make Acts of
<PB N="94" REF="124">
Parliament to empower the Ju&s;tices to &s;end
away all the poor Fellows they could pick
up, and force them into the Service.</P>
<P>NOR would this do neither; in the next
Reign the War being renewed, Men were
&s;o hard to be had, the Queen was oblig'd
to hire Troops from all the neighbouring
Princes, to form her Armies; &s;uch as
<HI>Saxons, He&s;&s;ians, Danes, Lunenburghers,</HI>
and the like, few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could be had
without the utmo&s;t Violence and Compul|&s;ion;
even the <HI>Scots</HI> them&s;elves, what with
Di&s;affection, and better Bu&s;ine&s;s, were not
able to &s;upply any &s;ufficient Numbers; the
Rea&s;on was plain; Trade flouri&s;h'd, the Ma|nufactures
were in Demand, the Merchants
gave out large Orders, and the Men were
full of Bu&s;ine&s;s: Indeed what poor Man in
his Sen&s;es, that could get nine Shillings,
ten Shillings, and twelve Shillings a Week
at his Loom, and at the Comb-Pot, or at
the Clothworking, Dre&s;&s;ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the
Manufactures, and live at home warm, ea&s;y,
and &s;afe, would go abroad and &s;tarve in a
Camp, or be knock'd on the Head on the
Counter&s;carp, at the Rate of three Shillings
and &s;ix Pence a Week?</P>
<P>AND here give me Leave to remind you
of a Piece of Hi&s;tory recent in every Man's
Head, and full to my Purpo&s;e. There was,
one Year of the late War with <HI>France,</HI> a very
terrible Scarcity of Corn throughout the
whole Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> &s;uch a Scarcity,
<PB N="95" REF="125">
that had it not been for the Merchants,
who, as we might &s;ay, rumaged the World
for Corn, many Thou&s;ands of People mu&s;t
have peri&s;h'd more than did, for many died
of meer Want.</P>
<P>IT happen'd that there having been three
terrible Blows given to the <HI>French</HI> King
the Year before, and his Armies having been
routed on &s;everal great Occa&s;ions, as at
the Relief of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> the Battle of <HI>Turin,</HI>
and the Battle of <HI>Ramellies</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
all in one Campaign, the King of <HI>France</HI>
found him&s;elf greatly embarra&s;s'd with the
Difficulty of recruiting his Armies, and it
was the Opinion of mo&s;t of the Confede|rates,
that the Fate of <HI>France</HI> was come; that
the Fall of the <HI>French</HI> Empire was at Hand,
for that his Armies were ruined, his Coun|try
threatned on all Hands, and his People
&s;tarving, and ready to cut one another's
Throats for Bread, &s;o that it &s;eem'd im|po&s;&s;ible
for him to re&s;tore his Troops.</P>
<P>IN this Di&s;tre&s;s the General Officers
were almo&s;t affraid to &s;peak to the King,
the old Monarch unacquainted with Mi&s;|fortunes,
was &s;o wayward, &s;o fretful, and
&s;o full of Re&s;entment, that none car'd to
meddle with it, and yet they &s;aw all was
going to Wreck.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, the King publi&s;h'd
&s;everal Orders, and employ'd People, and
i&s;&s;ued out Money every way for the ama&s;&s;ing
Corn, from all the Quarters of the World;
<PB N="96" REF="126">
even from the outmo&s;t Ports in the <HI>Levant,</HI>
to <HI>Egypt,</HI> to <HI>Syria,</HI> to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> to all the
I&s;les of the Arches, to the <HI>Gulph of Volo,</HI>
to <HI>Salonichi,</HI> and even to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it
&s;elf, and great Quantities of Corn were pro|cured,
which the King gave expre&s;s Orders
&s;hould be brought into the publick Maga|zines,
for the &s;upply of his Troops; but took
not the lea&s;t notice, nor &s;poke one Word
about rai&s;ing Men to recruit his Regiments,
and replace the many whole Brigades that
had been lo&s;t and cut off in the unhappy
Campaign that was pa&s;t; nor did he order
his Finnanciers or Payma&s;ters to i&s;&s;ue out any
Money for the Supply of that important
Article, as he was always wont to do.</P>
<P><HI>At la&s;t,</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Mare&s;chals</HI> of
<HI>France,</HI> who pre&s;umed upon their great In|tere&s;t
in his Favour, and were greatly con|cern'd
at the dangerous delay, as they
look'd on it to be, re&s;olv'd to move it to
him: <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI> fore&s;aw the Errand they
came about, but began with them plea|&s;antly
upon other Bu&s;ine&s;s, entertaining
them &s;o warmly with other Di&s;cour&s;e, that
he gave them no Opportunity to &s;peak a
Word about the main thing they came for,
<HI>namely</HI> rai&s;ing Recruits, and augmenting
his Troops, his Di&s;cour&s;e &s;till running ano|ther
Way.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY, <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI> enquired of
them &s;eparately, how the People far'd in
their Provinces, and in tho&s;e Provinces
<PB N="97" REF="127">
he knew were particularly under their Go|vernment,
with Re&s;pect to the want of
Corn; and all agreed, that the Mi&s;ery was
inexpre&s;&s;ible, and that many of the poor
People peri&s;h'd for Want. <HI>But,</HI> &s;ays the King,
<HI>How do my Troops fare? are the Orders I
gave for &s;upplying my poor Soldiers put in Exe|cution?</HI>
Yes Sir, <HI>&s;ays one of the Mare&s;chals,</HI>
and <HI>I think it was</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Villeroy,</HI> &s;uch
of your Maje&s;ty's Armies as are li&s;ted, are
taken care of. <HI>I under&s;tand you,</HI> &s;ays the
King, <HI>I have given no Orders for Recruits,
nor do I intend it till next Spring,</HI> and with
that &s;poke again of the Corn, <HI>Are my Ma|ga&s;ins
kept full?</HI> &s;ays the King. They an|&s;wered,
Yes, the Maga&s;ins were well &s;up|ply'd, and were all kept full.</P>
<P>The Officers were &s;urprized at what <HI>his
Maje&s;ty</HI> had &s;aid about Recruits; but &s;uch
was the fiery Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>augu&s;t Ty|rant,</HI>
that no body cared to make the lea&s;t
Reply to it; but with a profound Submi&s;|&s;ion
went away, as acquie&s;cing with the
King's Mea&s;ures, tho' they thought them
the mo&s;t ridiculous in the World, and
thought the King little better than &s;tupid, or
lunatick.</P>
<P>AT their going away, the King repeated
his Orders to them, to take effectual Care
that his Troops might be &s;upply'd with
Corn out of the publick Maga&s;ins in all the
Provinces where they were re&s;pectively
quartered, and told them he would have it
<PB N="98" REF="128">
publi&s;h'd that this was his Order, <HI>That &s;o
&s;ays the King,</HI> my good Soldiers &s;hall know
that if they &s;uffer any Want, it is not my
Fault, but the Fault of the <HI>Mare&s;chals</HI> of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, publick Notice was given
in Print for the Encouragement of the Troops,
that the King had given expre&s;s Orders, that
the Soldiers &s;hould be &s;upply'd with Corn out
of the publick Maga&s;ins, and the Regiments,
who&s;e Quarters were remote from the Ma|ga&s;ins,
were forthwith removed, &s;o as to be
near tho&s;e Maga&s;ins for their &s;upply.</P>
<P>THIS was no &s;ooner done, and that it
was every where known, that the Soldiers
had plenty of Bread, but the <HI>Mare&s;chals</HI>
complimented the Wi&s;dom of the King,
which they did not under&s;tand before; for
the poor &s;tarving Pea&s;ants run every where
to the Army, and li&s;ted &s;o fa&s;t, that tho' the
Army wanted near 80000 Men, the Troops
were fill'd up without any Expence, and
twenty new Regiments were rai&s;ed by way
of Augmentation; and all this with a &s;ur|pri&s;ing
Expedition.</P>
<P>THIS Story abundantly confirms what I
have &s;aid, and for that Rea&s;on I told it, <HI>viz.</HI>
that Poverty and Want rai&s;es Soldiers. Trade
is a Friend to Peace, and provides for the Peo|ple
a far better Way: Trade &s;ets them to work
for their Bread, not to fight for it; and if we
want Men in <HI>England,</HI> 'tis not that the
<PB N="99" REF="129">
Number is deficient, but becau&s;e they live
too well to go for Soldiers.</P>
<P>THIS al&s;o confirms what has been &s;aid
above, namely, that as the trading, middling
&s;ort of People in <HI>England</HI> are rich; &s;o the
labouring, manufacturing People under them
are infinitely richer than the &s;ame Cla&s;s of
People in any other Nation in the World.</P>
<P>AS they are richer, &s;o they live better,
fare better, wear better, and &s;pend more
Money, than they do in other Countries;
and I make no doubt 'tis the &s;ame in &s;ome
other Places in their Proportion, as well as
here; at lea&s;t, in free Nations, where the
People are not affraid to own their Circum|&s;tances,
and to appear in good Condition
when they are in good Condition: In &s;hort,
the Trade&s;men in <HI>England</HI> live in better
Figure than mo&s;t of the meaner Gentry;
and I may add than &s;ome of the &s;uperior
Rank in foreign Countries; nay, not to
magnifie Things here, and le&s;&s;en them
Abroad, it is very evident that we have
Trade&s;men or Shop-keepers, of very ordi|nary
Employments in <HI>London,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Chee&s;e|mongers,
Grocers, Chandlers, Bra&s;iers,
&V;phol&s;terers,</HI> and the like, who are able to
&s;pend more Money in their Families, and
do actually &s;pend more than mo&s;t Gentle|men
of from 300 to 500 Pounds a Year,
and that with this remarkable Addition,
that the Trade&s;man &s;hall &s;pend it, and grow
rich, and encrea&s;e under the Weight of the
<PB N="100" REF="130">
Expence; whereas the Gentleman &s;pends to
the Extent of his Revenue, and lays up
nothing.</P>
<P>HOW many Shop-keepers, Ware-hou&s;e|keepers,
and Whole&s;ale Traders, (to go a
Step higher) have we &s;een in <HI>London,</HI> &s;uch as
Drapers, Iron-Mongers, Salters, Haberda&s;h|ers,
<HI>Blackwell-hall,</HI> and other Factors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
who &s;hall &s;pend 500 Pound a Year in their
Hou&s;ekeeping, and other Incidents, and lay
up 500 Pound a Year more, while a Gen|tleman
of a Thou&s;and Pound a Year E&s;tate,
can hardly bring both Ends together at the
clo&s;e of the Year, and not live in a much
better Figure than the Trade&s;man, and not
at all in better Credit?</P>
<P>HOW do our Merchants in <HI>London, Bri|&s;tol,
Liverpole, Yarmouth, Hull,</HI> and other
trading Sea-Ports, appear in their Families,
with the Splendor of the be&s;t Gentlemen,
and even grow rich, tho' with the Luxury
and Expence of a Count of the Empire! &s;o
true it is, that, <HI>an E&s;tate is</HI> but <HI>a Pond,</HI> but
<HI>Trade is a Spring.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to look at the meaner People (for
among them, generally, the Wealth of
which I am now &s;peaking is lodg'd, be|cau&s;e,
their Number is &s;o exceeding great)
tho&s;e, it is evident, are in <HI>England</HI> &s;upport|ed
after a different manner from the People
of equal Rank in Trade among other Nati|ons;
let any Man that has &s;een how the
trading People, and the labouring Poor live
<PB N="101" REF="131">
abroad, make the Compari&s;on, it is too evi|dent
to be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>IT is upon the&s;e two Cla&s;&s;es of People,
the Manufacturers and the Shopkeepers,
that I build the Hypothe&s;is which I have
taken upon me to offer to the Publick, 'tis
upon the Gain they make either by their
Labour, or their Indu&s;try in Trade, and
upon their inconceivable Numbers, that the
Home Con&s;umption of our own Produce,
and of the Produce of foreign Nations im|ported
here, is &s;o exceeding great, and that
our Trade is rai&s;ed up to &s;uch a Prodigy of
Magnitude, as I &s;hall &s;hew it is.</P>
<P>I need not de&s;cribe it at large, a few
Words will give a Sketch of it, and a great
Volume will not line it out compleatly:
They eat well, and they drink well; for their
eating, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of Fle&s;h Meat, &s;uch as Beef,
Mutton, Bacon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Proportion to their
Circum&s;tances, 'tis to a Fault, nay, even to
Profu&s;ion; as to their Drink, 'tis generally
&s;tout &s;trong Beer, not to take notice of the
Quantity, which is &s;ometimes a little too
much, or good Table Beer for their ordi|nary
Diet; for the re&s;t, we &s;ee their Hou&s;es
and Lodgings tolerably furni&s;hed, at lea&s;t.
&s;tuff'd well with u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary hou&s;e|hold
Goods: Even tho&s;e we call poor Peo|ple,
Journey-men, working and Pains-ta|king
People do thus; they lye warm, live in
Plenty, work hard, and (need) know no
Want.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="132">
THESE are the People that carry off the
Gro&s;s of your Con&s;umption; 'tis for the&s;e
your Markets are kept open late on <HI>Saturday</HI>
Nights; becau&s;e they u&s;ually receive their
Week's Wages late: 'Tis by the&s;e the
Number of Alehou&s;es &s;ub&s;i&s;t, &s;o many Brew|ers
get E&s;tates, and &s;uch a va&s;t Revenue of
Exci&s;e is rai&s;ed; by the&s;e the va&s;t Quantity
of Meal and Malt is con&s;umed: And, in a
Word, the&s;e are the Life of our whole
Commerce, and all by their Multitude:
Their Numbers are not Hundreds or Thou|&s;ands,
or Hundreds of Thou&s;ands, but Mil|lions;
'tis by their Multitude, I &s;ay, that
all the Wheels of Trade are &s;et on Foot,
the Manufacture and Produce of the Land
and Sea, fini&s;hed, cur'd, and fitted for the
Markets Abroad; 'tis by the Largene&s;s of
their Gettings, that they are &s;upported, and
by the Largene&s;s of their Number the whole
Country is &s;upported; by their Wages they
are able to live plentifully, and it is by their
expen&s;ive, generous, free way of living, that
the Home Con&s;umption is rais'd to &s;uch a
Bulk, as well of our own, as of foreign
Production: If their Wages were low and
de&s;picable, &s;o would be their Living; if
they got little, they could &s;pend but little,
and Trade would pre&s;ently feel it; as their
Gain is more or le&s;s, the Wealth and Strength
of the whole Kingdom would ri&s;e or fall:
For as I &s;aid above, upon their Wages it all
depends; the Price of Provi&s;ions depends
<PB N="103" REF="133">
on the Con&s;umption of the Quantity; upon
the Rate of Provi&s;ions the Rent of Lands,
upon the Rent of Lands the Value of Taxes,
and upon the Value of Taxes, the Strength
and Power of the whole Body: So that
the&s;e are originally the fir&s;t Spring of all the
Motion.</P>
<P>IN like manner it affects foreign Trade;
if the Poors Wages abate, the Con&s;umption
of Quantity al&s;o, as above, would abate;
if the Quantity abates, the foreign Impor|tation
would abate, the Brandy, the Oyl,
the Fruit, the Sugar, the Tobacco: For if
the Poor have not the Money, they can't
&s;pare it for Superfluities, as tho&s;e foreign
Articles generally are, but mu&s;t pre&s;erve
it for Nece&s;&s;ity; upon their Nece&s;&s;ity de|pends
the Con&s;umption of the ordinary
Food, which is the Home Produce; and
upon their Superfluity depends the Con|&s;umption
of their Extraordinaries, which is
the foreign Importation.</P>
<P>EVEN the Wine, the Spice, the Coffee
and the Tea, after the Gentry have taken
the nice and fine Species off, are beholding to
the mean, middling and trading People to
carry off the coar&s;er Part, and the Bulk of
the Quantity goes off that way too: So that
the&s;e are the People that are the Life of
Trade.</P>
<P>THE Silk Manufactures are indeed a
Branch, the chief part of which the Gentry
may be &s;aid to &s;upport, and to help out
<PB N="104" REF="134">
Trade in: As to the Linen, they take in|deed
the fine&s;t Hollands, Cambricks, Mu|&s;lins,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the middling Trade&s;men
break in upon them, and follow them &s;o at
the Heels, that 'tis to be que&s;tioned, whe|ther,
as the Humour runs now, the Trade&s;|men
by the help of Numbers do not
out go them, even there al&s;o; not to men|tion
the va&s;t Quantity of Linens of other
Kind, which they con&s;ume every Day, im|ported
from <HI>Ireland, France, Ru&s;&s;ia, Po|land</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus mention'd the Sub&s;tance
of our Trade, and the Support of it, it
remains to examine a little the Magnitude
of the&s;e &s;everal Branches, as well of Ex|portation,
as of Importation, in Order to
make this Di&s;cour&s;e be according to my
Title, a true <HI>Plan of the Engli&s;h Commerce;</HI>
and here it is nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome little
Provi&s;os, again&s;t the too forward Expecta|tion
of the Reader, as to Numbers and
Calculations, in which it may be impo&s;&s;ible
to go the Length which may be unrea&s;ona|bly
expected.</P>
<P>THERE are many Things in our Com|merce,
as well Abroad as at Home, in
which no exact Calculation can be made;
and yet perhaps our E&s;timates and Con|jectures
may not be &s;o remote as &s;ome may
imagine, or &s;o, as that no probable Pro|&s;pect,
no rational View of the Commerce
may be made from them: <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="135">
IT is not po&s;&s;ible to make any Calculati|on
of the Number of Shop-keepers in
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> or of the Number of Spin|ners,
or of the Quantity of Wool, or of
the Bulk of the woollen Manufacture;
and yet, from what has been, and &s;hall be
&s;aid, I doubt not, we &s;hall form ju&s;t and
rational <HI>Ideas</HI> in our Thoughts, of the
Greatne&s;s of our Manufacture, and of our
home Trade; and &s;o of many other Things
which we cannot otherwi&s;e judge of, than
by &s;uch general E&s;timates.</P>
<P>THE World mu&s;t be left in the dark,
concerning many u&s;eful Parts of Knowledge,
if we were to take no Mea&s;ures, and form
no Ideas of Things from the Lights that
are given; tho' it &s;hould be true, that tho&s;e
Lights do not amount to Demon&s;trations;
and e&s;pecially, in Matters of this Kind,
where the Foundations are &s;ubject to va|rious
Changes, and where the whole is ra|ther
Matter of Ob&s;ervation, than real In|telligence
of Fact.</P>
<P>WE may make an E&s;timate of many
Branches of Trade, without being able to
determine the Dimen&s;ions of either the
Subject on which tho&s;e Branches are found|ed,
or of the particular Parts them&s;elves:
We may make ju&s;t E&s;timates of the Re|turns
or Trea&s;ure from the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
without enquiring into the Fund
of that Trea&s;ure, (<HI>viz.</HI>) how many Mines
there are di&s;covered, in which the Silver is
<PB N="106" REF="136">
found, or how much every Mine that is
di&s;cover'd produces; and thus we may en|tertain
a true Notion of the Magnitude
of woollen Manufacture, and of the great
Advantage of it to this Nation, without be|ing
able to know, to what Value the Return
of it amounts in a Year: We may give
an Account of its being able to con&s;ume
the whole Quantity of the Growth of our
Wool in <HI>England,</HI> and of much from <HI>Ire|land;</HI>
and we may bring this in Evidence
of the Magnitude of the whole Trade,
without being able to ca&s;t up how much
that Wool amounts to, <HI>and &s;o of the re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>WE may venture to &s;ay in Publick, that
we are a mo&s;t powerful Nation in Shipping,
having the greate&s;t Number of Ships and
Seamen, of any Nation in the World, with|out
being able to give a particular Account
how many Ships we have, or how many
Seamen we employ.</P>
<P>UPON the &s;ame Foundation, 'tis rea&s;ona|ble
to &s;ay, we may judge of the Magnitude
of our Commerce in general, by the &s;eve|ral
Circum&s;tances of the particular Bran|ches;
<HI>for Example,</HI> the Encrea&s;e of the
Con&s;umption or &s;uch and &s;uch Goods im|ported,
which are ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for
&s;uch or &s;uch a Manufacture, is a ju&s;t Mea|&s;ure,
by which to conclude the Encrea&s;e of
that Manufacture: In other Ca&s;es we may
have plainer Rules to judge from, and to
make our E&s;timates by; and yet, even tho&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="137">
Rules are not &s;uch, as that we can a&s;certain
tho&s;e E&s;timates upon that Foot, becau&s;e of
&s;everal Incidents in Trade, which cannot
be accounted for, any more than they can
be avoided.</P>
<P>WE may judge of the Con&s;umption of
Wines in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e they are all im|ported
from Abroad, and we can have an
exact Account of the annual Importation
from the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Books; but we
cannot po&s;itively a&s;certain the Con&s;ump|tion
from that Importation, becau&s;e, tho'
all that are enter'd at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,
are imported and con&s;um'd, yet all that
are con&s;um'd may not be enter'd at the
Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; clande&s;tine Trade, and &s;mug|gling
has a great Stroke in it; and the like
of foreign Brandy: <HI>Of both which hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>THUS again, we may judge of the Con|&s;umption
of Spirits, by the Quantity of
Malt di&s;till'd, and the Spirits of the fir&s;t
Extraction gaug'd by the Exci&s;e-Man; but
clande&s;tine Concealments have &s;o great a
Share in that Trade, that we can never &s;ay
our Calculations are exact.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, if our Calculations
and Gue&s;&s;es are rational and probable, we
hope in the&s;e Ca&s;es it may be allow'd to
be &s;ufficient, becau&s;e it is as far as any Man
can go. The Commerce of <HI>England,</HI> is
an immen&s;e and almo&s;t incredible Thing,
and as we mu&s;t content our &s;elves with be|ing
in &s;ome Ca&s;es in a difficulty as to Num|bers
<PB N="108" REF="138">
and Figures; but in all &s;uch Ca&s;es,
we expect the Reader will be content with
the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible Inquiry, and the utmo&s;t
po&s;&s;ible Di&s;covery that we are able to
make, and with &s;uch Rea&s;ons as may be
drawn from what appears, to judge of what
cannot be fully di&s;cover'd.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the fir&s;t Ri&s;e, Growth and
Encrea&s;e of the COMMERCE of
England.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is &s;omething difficult to adju&s;t
the Terms of our fir&s;t Part of
this Work, they are &s;et down in
general in our Title, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Ri&s;e, Growth, and Encrea&s;e of
our Trade; all which Words, as they im|ply
a Progre&s;&s;ion, they nece&s;&s;arily imply
a &s;tated Period, like an Epocha of Time,
from whence the Motion might be &s;aid to
begin like the &s;tarting Po&s;t, or Place of a
Race, where all that run, &s;et out exactly
upon an Equality, whatever Advantage is
obtain'd afterwards, being the Effect of the
Strength and Vigour of the Racers, whe|ther
Hor&s;es or Men.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e all Nations had &s;ome Trade,
and all People &s;ome Dealing with one a|nother
from the Begining; that is, ever
&s;ince they began to conver&s;e; when mutu|al
Convenience guided them to enquire
what they might either want from, or &s;pare
<PB N="110" REF="140">
to each other for the Supply of common
Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>BUT this would lead us back into dull
Speculations of the Nature and Original of
Commerce; a dry u&s;ele&s;s Subject, and
therefore carefully avoided in my Title,
where it may be ob&s;erv'd, that I do not
call this Work a Hi&s;tory of Trade, or a
Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade; but a Hi&s;|tory
of the <HI>Ri&s;e, Growth,</HI> and <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> of
it; by which I mean as above, from the
Time, <HI>let that Time be when you will,</HI> when
&s;tanding upon the Square with the re&s;t of
the World, <HI>England</HI> gave it &s;elf a Loo&s;e,
and got the Start of all the Nations a|bout
her in Trade; and having held it ever
&s;ince, her Commerce is by that Means
arriv'd to that Prodigy for Magnitude,
which it appears in at this Time, and
in which 'tis acknowledg'd by all her
Neighbours, &s;he out-does all the Nations
in the World, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the next
Chapter.</P>
<P>HOW to fix this Period without running
out into foreign Enquiries, and giving a
State of Things tedious in them&s;elves, and
remote from our De&s;ign, is the Thing we
are now to attend to; and tho' I &s;hall do
it my own Way, and may differ from the
Opinion of &s;ome wi&s;er than my &s;elf; yet,
I &s;hall endeavour to &s;upport my Opinion
with &s;uch Rea&s;ons, as &s;hall bring over &s;uch
differing Judgments to agree with me; or
<PB N="111" REF="141">
I &s;hall, for want of it, &s;ubmit to theirs;
&s;o that either way the End will be an|&s;wer'd,
and the Magnitude and Encrea&s;e
of the Commerce of <HI>England</HI> be con|firm'd
and de&s;crib'd, and the Time of it
a&s;certain'd.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> being an I&s;land &s;urrounded with
the Sea, and with neighbouring powerful Na|tions;
her Conver&s;e in Peace, and at other
Times her Wars with tho&s;e Nations, made
Shipping in particular exceedingly nece&s;&s;ary
to her; and we find upon many Occa&s;ions,
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleets not only very numerous,
but very formidable; yet Hi&s;tory is very
barren on that Occa&s;ion, nor is there the
lea&s;t Fragment to be gather'd up, that in|timates
to us, when, how, or in what man|ner
this Nation began their Acquaintance
with the Sea.</P>
<P>WE gather &s;ome Negatives indeed from
Hi&s;tory, as to this Part; we are pretty
well a&s;&s;ured, that the <HI>Britains</HI> had no
Knowledge of Navigation, nor do we read
of any Ships in U&s;e among them, when
<HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> landed here with a great
Navy.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Romans</HI> had Ships, and
that the <HI>Britans</HI> had none, or none con|&s;iderable,
will, I believe, be granted;
and as the <HI>Romans</HI> afterwards conquer'd
and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the I&s;land, as is evident
from Hi&s;tory, nothing then can be more
natural, than to &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>Romans</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="142">
fir&s;t introduc'd the Knowledge of Na|vigation,
and the U&s;e of Ships in this
I&s;land.</P>
<P>IT is true, and we are told it from Hi&s;to|ry,
that the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> traded hither &s;e|veral
Ages before the <HI>Romans,</HI> and with
their be&s;t Ships, no doubt; but be that
&s;o or no, we do not find that the <HI>Britains</HI>
learn'd any thing from them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Danes,</HI> after this, came in great
Fleets, and ravag'd the Coa&s;ts, both of
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Normandy;</HI> what their Ships
were, we know not; but 'tis evident, they
were &s;uch, as neither the <HI>Britains</HI> or <HI>Sax|ons</HI>
could cope with; &s;o that even after
the <HI>Romans</HI> were gone, the Knowledge of
Shipping and Navigation &s;eems to be much
&s;unk and decay'd in <HI>England,</HI> and even in
this whole Part of the World; for accord|ing
to Mr. <HI>Cambden,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> them&s;elves
came over in &s;trange Boats; that is to
&s;ay, in Boats or Ve&s;&s;els, as we may &s;uppo&s;e,
built of Wood; that is, of Timber and
Boards, or Planks, and cover'd with a
kind of Tarpawlin, or Canvas dipt in Tar
and Oil, which being nail'd upon the Plank,
&s;erv'd in&s;tead of Caulking, to keep out the
Water.</P>
<P>IF this is true, the northern World, who
at this Time &s;o much out-do the re&s;t of
the Nations in the navigating Skill, came
very late into the Knowledge, either of
<PB N="113" REF="143">
building of Ships, or of managing them
when built.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Danes,</HI> we may &s;uppo&s;e, had bet|ter
Ve&s;&s;els, tho' not &s;uch as would now
de&s;erve the Name of Ships, and were nei|ther
fit for Fight or Freight, for War or
Trade; only prepar'd to waft over a Par|cel
of Thieves and Rovers, who came in
a de&s;perate manner, to fight, plunder and
de&s;troy, without any View or De&s;ign of
returning; and therefore, when they burnt
their Ships, as &s;ometimes they did, and
&s;ometimes the <HI>Britains</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h Saxons</HI>
rather did for them, they had no great
Lo&s;s, for &s;ending but one Ve&s;&s;el Expre&s;s to
<HI>Norway,</HI> or to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Juitland,</HI> they
pre&s;ently had as many more as they plea&s;ed;
but all this while, here was no Shipping
for Trade, no nor much Bu&s;ine&s;s for Ship|ping,
if they had been furni&s;h'd with Ve&s;|&s;els
to be employ'd.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, what Commerce there
was carry'd on at that Time between <HI>Bri|tain</HI>
and any other Countries, the Parti|culars
of which, it is very hard to know,
was certainly carry'd on in foreign Bot|oms,
till the Encrea&s;e of Commerce
brought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to build Ships, or the
Encrea&s;e of Shipping brought the Com|merce;
take it which Way we will, one is
as probable as the other.</P>
<P>IT is true, that <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> tran&s;port|ed
his Army over hither in Ships and Gal|lies,
<PB N="114" REF="144">
from the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> from <HI>Gaul</HI>
as he calls it in his Commentaries; but 'tis
as true by the &s;ame Commentary, that
he cau&s;ed tho&s;e Ships to be built by his
own People, I mean, <HI>Romans;</HI> for we do
not find that the <HI>Gauls,</HI> any more than the
<HI>Britains,</HI> had any Ships before.</P>
<P>HE built the Ships it is &s;aid in about two
Months, &s;o that they could not be very
great; and he tells &s;omething of it him&s;elf,
that for the Gallies, when they were land|ed
in <HI>Britain,</HI> they haul'd them up upon
the Beach: What Ships were employ'd for
Commerce, we cannot tell; yet there was
&s;ome Trade at that Time too; for <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>
&s;ays, the <HI>Britains</HI> had Intelligence of his
De&s;ign to invade them, by Merchants who
frequented their Coa&s;ts: See <HI>Cae&s;. Com.</HI>
Lib. IV. Cap. 9. But all this leaves us
in the Dark, either as to their Commerce,
or their Navigation; what they traded in,
or what Ve&s;&s;els they traded with; 'tis cer|tain,
the <HI>Britains</HI> had very little Trade,
and le&s;s Shipping, for we read of no$e of
their Ships for many Ages afterward.</P>
<P>WHETHER therefore in &s;ucceeding Ages,
Navigation introduc'd Trade, or Trade
Navigation, is a Di&s;pute not much mate|rial
here; 'tis probable it may &s;tand thus,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) Nece&s;&s;ity produc'd the Conver&s;e of
Nations one with another, for the Supply
of their mutual Wants, exchanging the
<PB N="115" REF="145">
Produce of their re&s;pective Countries, as
their Wants &s;everally directed.</P>
<P>THIS exchanging of the Produce of
Countries, produced Commerce or Trade.</P>
<P>TRADE thus explain'd, nece&s;&s;arily re|quired
a <HI>Voiture</HI> or Carriage of Goods, by
Land or by Water; the latter requir'd Ve&s;|&s;els
to carry them in, either to &s;ail or to row,
and this is Navigation.</P>
<P>IF I was to write a Hi&s;tory of Naviga|tion,
I &s;hould go back here to the fir&s;t In|vention
of Boats to row, of which they tell
us the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> were the Inventers; and
of Sails to make u&s;e of the Wind, of which
they tell us the Fable of <HI>Dedalus</HI> and <HI>Ica|rus</HI>
is a Repre&s;entation, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Dedalus</HI>
being a Pri&s;oner at <HI>Cyprus,</HI> contriv'd a Sail
to his Boat, and taking his Opportunity
when the Wind blew fre&s;h from the Shore,
put boldly out to Sea in the Sight of all the
People; his Son <HI>Icarus</HI> doing the like in
another Boat fitted out by his Father's Di|rection.
That the People enraged to &s;ee
them attempt their E&s;cape even before
their Faces, pur&s;ued them with Boats row'd
with many Oars, laughing at the Madne&s;s
of the Attempt. But that when they came
out to Sea, <HI>Dedalus</HI> run two Foot for their
one, <HI>as the Seamen expre&s;s it;</HI> the Sea al&s;o
being rough, and the Wind blowing a fre&s;h
Gale; &s;o he made his E&s;cape from them all,
which they called flying in the Air with
waxen Wings. As for his Son <HI>Icarus,</HI> he
<PB N="116" REF="146">
outwent his Pur&s;uers too, but impatient,
and not content with his E&s;cape, but wil|ling
to go fa&s;ter, he crowding too much
Sail, as the Seamen call it, or not having
Judgment to &s;ill, trim, and manage his Sails
skilfully as his Father did, he over-&s;et
his Boat, and was drown'd which the
Fable repre&s;ents, by &s;oaring too high, and
melting his Wings.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e Things would lead me out of
my Way, I am not writing of Navigation,
but of Trade and Commerce: So I return
to my Subject.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the <HI>Dutch,</HI> [(for the <HI>Flemings</HI>
were all called <HI>Dutch</HI>) a diligent and labo|rious
People were in Trade before us, and
being in Search of proper Methods to im|prove
and enrich them&s;elves, fell to Manu|facturing.
In this the fir&s;t of their Im|provement,
as I am a&s;&s;ured by good Au|thority,
was <HI>making Linen,</HI> which they
fell into by the In&s;truction of &s;ome <HI>Cartha|ginian</HI>
Merchants, who fled into <HI>France</HI>
by Sea from the Fury of the Wars between
the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> which War
afterwards ended in the De&s;truction of their
City.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that the <HI>Carthagini|ans</HI>
were great Friends to Trade, and En|couragers
both of Merchants and of Manu|facture
(that is a Hi&s;tory by it &s;elf). The&s;e
I &s;ay &s;led to <HI>France,</HI> and thence &s;ome of
them to <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the <HI>Romans</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="147">
had not made &s;o intire a Conque&s;t as in
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>HERE they fell to Trade, and Manufactu|ring,
and having planted the Flax, which
they found the Country very proper to
produce, they of Cour&s;e &s;et the People to
Work, in&s;tructing them how to dre&s;s the
Flax, &s;pin the Yarn or Thread, weave
the Cloth, bleach it afterwards, and then to
&s;ell it; and this I take to be a true Account
of &s;etting up the Linen Manufacture in
the &s;eventeen Provinces.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> had their Linen
Manufacture from the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI>
they from the <HI>Tyrians</HI> or <HI>Phaenicians,</HI>
of whom they were a Colony, and
they from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the fine Li|nen
of <HI>Aegypt</HI> is often mentioned in
the Scripture Hi&s;tory, and in others
al&s;o, as the mo&s;t antient.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY &s;eldom wants Bu&s;ine&s;s: The
<HI>Flemings</HI> falling into the Manufacture of
Linen, it led them as it were by the Hand
into that of the Wool; and the &s;ame <HI>Car|thaginian</HI>
Refugees put them upon that al|&s;o,
for the old <HI>Numidians</HI> had Wool in
great Plenty, and the Wool of <HI>Barbary</HI> is
good to this Day.</P>
<P>BUT here they were put to a Stop, for
neither <HI>Belgia (Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI>) or
<HI>Gaul (France</HI>) yielded any Wool: This
balk'd their Undertaking for a while;
but the diligent Trade&s;man never tires; it
<PB N="118" REF="148">
was not long before, &s;earching among the
neighbouring Nations, they found that
they had Wool in <HI>Britains,</HI> and that &s;o
fine and good, that no other Wool the
World produced was equal to it, for their
Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS encouraged them &s;o, that they
bought the Wool in <HI>Britain,</HI> manufactured
it in <HI>Belgia,</HI> and &s;upplied fir&s;t them&s;elves, and
afterwards the neighbouring Countries with
woollen Manufactures, to the great Encrea&s;e
of the Wealth and Power of the <HI>Nether|lands;</HI>
e&s;pecially by drawing infinite Mul|titudes
of People to them, &s;o that they
&s;oon became, from, a few fi&s;hing Towns,
and a poor labouring People, to be a mo&s;t
populous, rich, and powerful Nation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Britains</HI> too, in their Degree,
found the Sweetne&s;s of this Encrea&s;e of
Commerce, and next to the <HI>Flemings</HI> had
their Share of the Gain from the Wool of
their Sheep: This Wool was but of &s;mall
Value to them before; for in&s;tead of manu|facturing
in as the <HI>Flemings</HI> did, they wore
the Skins of their Sheep with the Wool on:
But now the <HI>Flemings</HI> eagerly calling for
the Wool, and giving a good Price for it,
the <HI>Britains</HI> were not only encouraged to
pre&s;erve it, but to nouri&s;h and take more
Care of their Sheep, in order to encrea&s;e
the Number of them, that they might, in
the Con&s;equence, encrea&s;e the Wool.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="149">
THUS began the <HI>Engli&s;h Commerce,</HI>
and thus it may be &s;aid began the Opulence
and Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; for
the <HI>Flemings</HI> took off their Wool in a pro|digious
Quantity, and gave al&s;o a prodigi|ous
Price for it.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> WE find in King <HI>Edward</HI> the
III's. Time they gave 40 <HI>l.</HI> a Pack
for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool, which by the
Way was more than 200 <HI>l.</HI> a Pack,
as Money goes now; but of that in
its Place.</P>
<P>THIS filled the Nation with Money,
the Merchants grew rich, the Staple of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool was erected at <HI>Antwerp,</HI>
50000 Packs of Wool was the lea&s;t that
was carried thither yearly, and the Fleets
of Ships which carried over the Wool, and
which went generally from <HI>Southampton</HI>
and <HI>London,</HI> were &s;uch, that &s;ometimes
Fifty, Sixty, to 100 Sail, went off at a
Time.</P>
<P>IT is to be doubted indeed, the Ships
were mo&s;t of them <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that is to
&s;ay <HI>Flemings,</HI> or in general <HI>Dutch,</HI> for I
do not find, but that as they were before us
in Trade and Manufacture, &s;o they were
al&s;o before us in Shipping and Navigation;
tho' growing rich by the Wool, we &s;oon
fell in to building Ships too, e&s;pecially as
Trade encrea&s;ed; of which hereafter.</P>
<P>As the Quantity of the Wool was thus
great, and the Price al&s;o, the Ballance of
<PB N="120" REF="150">
Trade was nece&s;&s;arily very great on our
Side, I mean great to the Advantage of
<HI>Britain;</HI> for the <HI>Britain</HI> bought but little
of any Goods from Abroad, for many A|ges
after this, and their Wool was gene|rally
paid for in Money; nay, they had
two &s;everal Products, be&s;ide the Wool,
which were peculiar to <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
and which no other Nation in the World
had, (<HI>viz.</HI>) their <HI>Block Tin,</HI> and their
<HI>Lead.</HI></P>
<P>WE have very good Evidence, that both
the&s;e Metals were found and dug by the
antient <HI>Britains,</HI> long before this, and e|&s;pecially
that the Tin was fetch'd from
<HI>Britain</HI> by the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> many Ages
before the Time I am now &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>I take it, that at the fir&s;t of the Trade
with the <HI>Flemings,</HI> the Importations of
<HI>Britain</HI> were &s;o &s;mall, that the Export of
<HI>Tin</HI> and <HI>Lead</HI> was &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e all
that they wanted from Abroad: So that
the Wool was nece&s;&s;arily all paid for in
Specie.</P>
<P>THIS I &s;ay enrich'd the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nati|ons
to a very great Degree, $ill'd them
with ready Money, and e&s;pecially the lan|ded
Men grew very rich and powerful by
it, I mean the Barons, Knights, Gentlemen
and other Degrees, for they were the
Men that got the Money, the Wool and
the Sheep being their own.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="151">
<HI>N. B.</HI> WHEN I &s;ay other Degrees of
Men, I mean plainly the Clergy, for the
religious Hou&s;es had many, if not mo&s;t
of their Rents paid in Wool; and
&s;ome had large Flocks of Sheep of
their own, kept by their own Shep|herds,
for the Supply of the Hou&s;e,
(that is the Fryars) and their large
Attendants with Mutton, and for Sup|ply
of Money to their Coffers by the
Wool; and we &s;ee the Clergy tax'd in
King <HI>Edward</HI> the III's Time, in
&s;o much Wool to the King and his
Wars.</P>
<P>IT is almo&s;t incredible what immen&s;e
Sums of Money came over yearly to this
Kingdom for the Wool, and how rich and
powerful <HI>England</HI> grew by this Means,
even in the Time of the <HI>Normans</HI> Govern|ment;
and had they not been &s;o often ex|hau&s;ted
by foreign Wars, peel'd and pol'd
by their tyrant Princes, ravag'd and wa&s;ted
at home by one another, I mean in civil
Di&s;&s;entions, and plunder'd and emptied by
the fooli&s;h and ridiculous Zeal, or rather
Fury, call'd <HI>the Holy War,</HI> they might
have been infinitely richer than they
were.</P>
<P>LET but any Man of Figures calculate
the Commerce at that Time; the Wool on|ly
that was exported, at the Rate above
mentioned, amounted to two Millions <HI>Ster|ling</HI>
in Specie; an immen&s;e Sum, and more
<PB N="122" REF="152">
than Ten Millions <HI>per Annum</HI> would be
now.</P>
<P>IT is indeed very &s;trange, that when
every Thing el&s;e was &s;o cheap, the Wool
&s;hould be &s;o dear, and that now, when every
Thing el&s;e is &s;o dear, the Wool &s;hould
be &s;o cheap; we only are left in &s;ome Un|certainty
as to what was then called a Pack
of Wool, and how they could give &s;uch a
Price for it; if the Pack was the &s;ame then
as it is now, the Price was intolerable,
perhaps it might be made up in &s;uch large
Packs, as we &s;till &s;ee &s;ometimes brought into
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> one of which loads a Waggon,
and is called a Poke of Wool, or a Pocket;
but that we cannot now determine: But be
the Bulk what it will, the Number of
Packs was the &s;ame.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the Pack of Wool mu&s;t be much
larger than it is now, otherwi&s;e the Quan|tity
of Wool produced in <HI>England</HI> was but
trifling; for as to 50000 Packs of Wool to
be the whole Crop, or the whole Product,
'tis ridiculous to &s;ugge&s;t it, 'tis evident
we import more than twice that Quantity
now yearly from <HI>Ireland,</HI> in Wool or
in Yarn; the Wool of <HI>England</HI> is more
likely to amount to five Hundred Thou|&s;and
Packs, than to fifty Thou&s;and; and
we are a&s;&s;ured, as you will &s;ee, by a ju&s;t
Calculation in its Place, that the Sheep $ed
in <HI>Rumney</HI> Ma&s;h only in <HI>Kent&punc;</HI> make 2523
Packs of Wool every Year; which, were
<PB N="123" REF="153">
the whole calculated, is not a two Hun|dredth
Part of the Wool of the whole
Country.</P>
<P>BUT to leave our Gue&s;&s;es at the Mag|nitude
of the Pack of Wool, I am ready to
grant it mu&s;t be larger than ours are now,
which are but two hundred and forty
Pound Weight to a Pack, and could never
be worth forty Pound Sterling; but if a Pack
was a Poke, and weighed twenty Hundred
Weight, as the Poke of Wool &s;till does, and
is called in &s;ome Places a Load of Wool, be|cau&s;e
'tis <HI>a Waggon Load,</HI> then indeed it
might yield &s;uch a Rate (tho' dear too) and
it al&s;o agrees be&s;t with the Growth or
Crop of <HI>Wool</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> which would
then be about 400000 Packs a Year, and it
was an immen&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s of its Kind too,
for the Time of Day in Trade.</P>
<P>THAT this Trade was really a Prodigy
for Magnitude, at that Time, appears by
many Particular Circum&s;tances; and e&s;pe|cially
by this, that great Increa&s;e of Wealth
and People, which the Manufacturing of it
brought to the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> that is, to
the &s;eventeen Provinces, who&s;e Greatne&s;s,
as well as ours, began here.</P>
<P>NOR is it &s;o long ago that this Trade
receiv'd a Turn, that we &s;hould want Evi|dence
of the Fact, for it continued in the
&s;ame Situation to the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the
VII. and tho' we began then (by the Wi&s;|dom
and Sagacity of the Prince) to break
<PB N="124" REF="154">
in upon the <HI>Flemings,</HI> and to manufacture
much of our Wool at home, yet we find no
Prohibition of the Exportation of Wool,
till the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> for the
Fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. we find a large Fleet
of <HI>Flemings</HI> laden with Wool, &s;a$l'd from
<HI>Southampton</HI> for the <HI>Scheld,</HI> being above
&s;ixty Sail, that Wool being &s;ent to pay the
King's Debts.</P>
<P>I have met with &s;ome who are of the
Opinion, that the Trade of the <HI>Nether|lands</HI>
in the Woollen Manufacture, was
much greater then, than it is now here, or
than it has ever been &s;ince; and they give
the&s;e Rea&s;ons for it,</P>
<P>1. THAT if they had not had a mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive
con&s;umption, they could never have
been able to have con&s;umed &s;uch a Quantity
of Wool; for <HI>England</HI> being not enclo&s;ed
and cultivated then, as it is now, they &s;up|po&s;e
the Quantity of Wool was much grea|ter,
than it has been at any time &s;ince.</P>
<P>2. THAT they had no Rivals in the Trade;
no other Nation, for many Ages, having
any &s;uch thing as a woollen Manufacture
among them; and this gave them &s;uch a
Command of the Trade, as to be able to
give a Price for the Materials, and to &s;ell
the Manufacture when wrought at a Rate
in Proportion.</P>
<P>3. THAT by the &s;ame Rule they had all
the Trade; and tho' it is true, they had not
extended the woollen Manufacture into
<PB N="125" REF="155">
<HI>Turky, Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and to both the <HI>Indies,</HI> as it
is now, and to &s;everal other remote Coun|tries;
yet, on the other hand, they had the
whole Extent of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and the
<HI>German Empire, Poland, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Den|mark,</HI>
to &s;upply with Goods; none of tho&s;e
Countries making any thing of a Woollen
Manufacture; and as at length, the Domi|nions
of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> fell to the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and that <HI>Spain, Germany,
Italy,</HI> and the whole <HI>&s;eventeen Provinces,</HI>
were united under one Head, in the Go|vernment
of that great Monarch <HI>Charles</HI>
V. they were allowed an unlimited Com|merce
through all his Dominions, and had all
po&s;&s;ible Encouragement for their Goods, of
which I might give many Particulars.</P>
<P>THESE things con&s;idered, it mu&s;t be gran|ted,
that their Trade was exceeding great;
whether it was equal or &s;uperior to our
Trade of the &s;ame kind now, is what no
body can make any Calculation of: And
therefore I &s;hall not attempt to form any
Plan or View or Trade upon tho&s;e remote
Gue&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE Turn given to this Trade afterward,
and the Wealth rai&s;ed upon it in <HI>England</HI>
in &s;o &s;hort a Space, as was &s;een in <HI>Queen
Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, may give us &s;ome Idea of
what it was before; and this part indeed
cannot without a Breach in our Work, as it
is propo&s;ed in my Title, be quite pa&s;s'd
over; but I &s;hall be as brief in it as I can.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="156">
THAT King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. was the fir&s;t
Prince that put the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> upon the
Thought of manufacturing their own Wool,
mu&s;t be acknowledged to his Memory; we
&s;hould not do him Ju&s;tice, if we did not
mention it, as often as the Original of our
Woollen Manufacture is &s;poken of.</P>
<P>HE had been a kind of a Refugee in the
Court of his Aunt the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Burgun|dy,</HI>
being forc'd to make his E&s;cape from
<HI>Bretagne,</HI> where he fir&s;t harbour'd; while
he was here, he had opportunity to &s;ee as
well as hear of the mighty Increa&s;e and Im|provement
of the Commerce of tho&s;e Coun|tries;
how populous their Cities, how rich
their Burghers, how great their Merchants,
how all the People were bu&s;y, and employ'd;
hardly a Child above five Years old, but
could do &s;omething to gain its Bread; and
particularly, it could not e&s;cape his Ob&s;erva|tion,
that all this Commerce, all this Wealth,
all this Imployment of the People depended
entirely upon the Supply of the Materials,
<HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Wool</HI> and <HI>Fullers Earth</HI> from
<HI>England;</HI> that they had not a Pack of Wool
of their own in the whole Country, and if
that Source &s;hould by any Accident be &s;top|ped,
they &s;hould be all ruin'd, their Trade
would be at a full Stop, and in a Word, that
the Manufacture could not be carried on
without it.</P>
<P>TO a Prince of &s;uch Penetration as he
was, it could not but occur after he came to
<PB N="127" REF="157">
the Crown, that certainly <HI>England</HI> was
much in the wrong, to let their Wool go
out of the Country thus unmanufactur'd,
and to let Strangers be made rich by
the working of it, while his own People
&s;at idle and unemployed, and con&s;equently
&s;tarving the Poor.</P>
<P>THAT without doubt, where the Prin|cipals
and Materials of the Manufacture
were only to be found, there Nature &s;eem'd
to direct the making of the Manufacture it
&s;elf, and there it might be wrought with
the greatest Advantage; that, at lea&s;t, it
would be an Advantage to his own King|dom,
and that he could &s;ee no Rea&s;on why
that Advantage &s;hould be given away. In
&s;hort, he re&s;olved, that if he could prevent
it, Strangers &s;hould no longer eat the Bread
out of the Mouths of his own Subjects.</P>
<P>I need not enter here into the particular
Mea&s;ures the King took to put this happy
Re&s;olve of his in Execution; 'tis enough to
mention it here, that in Per&s;uit of the&s;e
Ob&s;ervations, he immediately let about the
Work, applied him&s;elf to the finding out pro|per
Instruments for the carrying it on, and
&s;et the Manufacture of Wool on Foot in
&s;everal Parts of his Country, as particularly
at <HI>Wakefield, Leeds</HI> and <HI>Hallifax,</HI> in the
We&s;t Riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> a Country pitch'd
upon for its particular Situation, adapted to
the Work, being fill'd with innumerable
Springs of Water, Pits of Coal, and other
<PB N="128" REF="158">
Things proper for carrying on &s;uch a Bu&s;I|ne&s;s,
and where it remains and thrives to
this Day.</P>
<P>BUT not, I &s;ay, to enter into the Particu|lars
of this historically, which would be too
tedious, 'tis &s;ufficient to lay, the anxious
Care of this Prince for the Pro&s;perity of his
People has been followed with &s;uch a glori|ous
Succe&s;s, that the Example is perfectly
fitted to fire the Brea&s;t of any &s;ucceeding
Monarch, who de&s;ires the Good of his
Subjects with the &s;ame paternal Warmth for
the general Improvement; and for this End
I mention it, and for this End the&s;e Sheets
are thus addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;upreme Powers of
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government, and at this Time
too; becau&s;e, being a&s;&s;ur'd that his pre|&s;ent
Maje&s;ty has the &s;ame Ardour and Affe|ction,
the &s;ame improving Genius, and the
Advantage of a much greater Fund of Wealth
and Power for the advancing the Intere&s;t of
his People, nothing may be wanting to lay
open the &s;everal Pro&s;pects for the farther
improving the Commerce and extending the
Manufactures of <HI>England</HI> which yet remain,
and which perhaps have not been &s;o tho|rowly
con&s;ider'd of by any other Hand.</P>
<P>THO' <HI>King Henry</HI> acted with a Vigor
becoming a Prince, and one that knew how
to execute, as well as how to re&s;olve, for the
Advantage of his own Dominions; yet he
knew withal, that it was an Attempt of
&s;uch a Magnitude, as well de&s;erv'd the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="129" REF="159">
Prudence and Caution, that as it was
not to be attempted ra&s;hly; &s;o it was not
to be pu&s;h'd with too much Warmth: And
therefore, tho' he did not fail to encourage
his People in working and manufacturing,
and at a con&s;iderable Expence, &s;ecretly pro|cured
a great many Foreigners, who were
perfectly skill'd in the Manufacture, to come
over and in&s;truct his own People here in
their Beginnings; yet he did not immedi|ately
prohibit the exporting the Wool to the
<HI>Flemings,</HI> neither did he, till &s;ome Years
after, load the Exportation of it with any
more Duties than he had before.</P>
<P>NAY, &s;o far was the King from being able
to compleat his De&s;ign, that he could ne|ver
come to a total Prohibition of expor|ting
the Wool in his Reign; he did indeed
offer at it, but found, that if he had pro|ceeded,
his People were not Ma&s;ters enough
of the Trade to work up the whole Quan|tity
of the Wool, and con&s;ume the Growth;
that the <HI>Flemings</HI> were old in the Bu&s;ine&s;s,

this Way and that Way, to new Sorts and
Kinds of Goods, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could
not pre&s;ently know, and when known, had
not Skill pre&s;ently to imitate: And that
therefore they mu&s;t proceed gradually.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if in &s;ome Years the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were
able to &s;upply them&s;elves, and make Goods
enough for the Home Con&s;umption, &s;o that
they had no need to buy from the <HI>Flemings</HI>

the Manufactures of their own Wool, This
was a great Point gain'd, and was a Step
&s;ufficient for the fir&s;t Ages of the Manu|facture;
whereas, to have prohibited the
Wool being carry'd out while they were
not able to &s;upply the Markets abroad,
was to ruin the Trade in general, and &s;top
the Con&s;umption of the Wool too.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the King acted like a
wi&s;e and warlike Prince, be&s;ieging a City,
who tho' he attacks the Garri&s;on, and
batters the Out-works with the utmo&s;t
Fury, yet &s;pares the Inhabitants, and for|bears
as much as he can ruining the City,
which he expects to make his own: So
the King &s;eem'd willing to let the <HI>Flemings</HI>
keep up the Trade, till his Subjects were
thoro'ly enabled to take it into their own
Hands, and not de&s;troy a Commerce, which
he knew would one Time or other be his
own.</P>
<P>UPON this Foot, I &s;ay, the prudent
Prince went on by Mea&s;ures perfectly well
adjuu&s;ted, and particularly adapted to the
End which he aim'd at; and tho' he did
once pretend to &s;top the Exportation of
the Wool, he conniv'd at the Breach of
his Order, and afterwards took off the Pro|hibition
entirely, leaving the Succe&s;s of his
Undertaking, to the Indu&s;try of his Peo|ple,
who, he perceiv'd, to his great Sa|tisfaction,
went on with Courage and
Chearfulne&s;s, improv'd daily, and would
<PB N="131" REF="163">
at la&s;t entirely carry the Bu&s;ine&s;s from the
<HI>Flemings,</HI> by the meer Cour&s;e of Things.</P>
<P>IN this Manner the Manufacture began,
and thus gradually it encreas'd; nor was
it much le&s;s than one hundred Years, be|fore
<HI>England</HI> came to &s;uch a Perfection, as
to be able to claim the Property of it
to them&s;elves, and to prohibit the Expor|tation
of the Wool, which was never ef|factually
done, till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tyranny
under the Duke <HI>d'Alva</HI> fini&s;h'd the ruin
of the Commerce of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI>
by driving the <HI>Dutch</HI> into a Common-Wealth,
to ca&s;t off entirely the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Government; and by forcing the Prote|&s;tant
<HI>Flemings,</HI> who, indeed, were the
chief Manufacturers, to take Shelter in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
where they pre&s;ently erected all the
&s;everal Species of the Manufacture, which
were not &s;et up before.</P>
<P>THUS it was, from the Year 1489, when
King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. began to encourage the
Manufacture in <HI>England,</HI> to the Year 1587,
when Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> may be &s;aid to &s;ee
it arriv'd to its Perfection, that this great
Work was gradually encrea&s;ing and bring|ing
forward.</P>
<P>IT is worth ob&s;erving here, in how &s;hort a
Time the Queen having fully &s;top'd the
Stream of Wool which &s;upported the Ma|nufacture
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> &s;pread the Com|merce
of <HI>England,</HI> into the remote&s;t Parts
of the then known World, and carry'd
<PB N="132" REF="164">
the Trade of the woollen Manufacture of
<HI>England,</HI> into every Part which the <HI>Flem|ings</HI>
had &s;upply'd before, and to many
Places where they had no Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>1. THE <HI>Dutch,</HI> who were erected into
a &s;eparate State under the Queen's Protecti|on,
and who breaking off from the <HI>Flem|ings,</HI>
that is, from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had no
Commerce with them, meddled not with
Manufacturing, but apply'd them&s;elves to
their fi&s;nng Trade, and to foreign Mer|chandize;
and having before a very great
Corre&s;pondence by their Rivers, <HI>viz,</HI> the
<HI>Maes,</HI> the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> and other Rivers into <HI>Ger|man,</HI>
they naturally apply'd to <HI>England</HI>
for the woollen Manufacture, which they
had formerly been &s;upply'd with from
<HI>Flanders,</HI> and were, as we may call them,
our fir&s;t Cu&s;tomers for them Abroad.</P>
<P>2. THE <HI>Queen</HI> heartily engaged in the
Intere&s;t of her People, and particularly
e&s;pou&s;ing her Merchants, &s;ent formal Em|ba&s;&s;ies,
with &s;plendid Retinues, and in the
mo&s;t honourable Manner, for the opening
the Sluices of Trade to her Subjects; 1. To
the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> 2. To the <HI>Great Duke,</HI>
or Emperor of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia or Mu&s;covy.</HI> 3. To the
<HI>Great Mogul;</HI> 4. To the King of, <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and
in a Word, to every other Place, whither
her enterpri&s;ing Subjects de&s;ir'd her; for it
was at that Time an enterpri&s;ing Age, and
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants &s;pread the Seas
<PB N="133" REF="165">
with their Ships, as the Poet expre&s;&s;es it,
every where as far
<Q>As Winds could carry, or as Waters
roll.</Q></P>
<P>3. UNDER her Maje&s;ty's Conduct, and
by her particular Encouragement, her fortu|nate
Navigators, her Merchants, and o|ther
Adventurers began to &s;hew them&s;elves,
not experienc'd only in, but Patrons and
Improvers of Navigation, beyond all the
Trades of the World; they ranged about
the Seas having then no Rivals; &s;earch|ing
the Globe for Di&s;coveries, planting Co|lonies,
and &s;ettling Factories in all Parts of
the World: But I mu&s;t come to &s;peak of
this Part again more at large.</P>
<P>BY this la&s;t Part of the Queen's Manage|ment,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) prohibiting the Exportation
of the Wool, the woollen Manufacture in
the <HI>Netherlands</HI> received its f&s;atal Wound;
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> cruelty &s;catter'd the chief Manu|facturers,
and the Prohibition &s;tarv'd tho&s;e
that were left; for now having no more
Wool to work up, the Work it &s;elf &s;top'd
at once, the Trade expir'd and dy'd: Nor
has it been able &s;ince that to revive, no
not in the lea&s;t Degree; for as it depended
before entirely, upon the Supply of Wool
from <HI>England</HI> for its Support, when that
Stream &s;aid, when that Chanel &s;top'd, it
could no more &s;ub&s;i&s;t, than a Body with|out
<PB N="134" REF="166">
out Food, or Life without Sprits: In a
word, the <HI>Flemings</HI> impoveri&s;h'd and poor,
di&s;per&s;ed and fed; their great Cities, &s;uch
as <HI>Antwerp, Ghent, Li&s;le,</HI> and other Pla|ces
wa&s;ted and decayed; the People went
away into other Parts to &s;eek Peace and
Employment; the populous Towns became
thin of Inhabitants, compared to what they
were; and the new e&s;tabli&s;h'd Common|Wealth
of <HI>Holland</HI> became populous and
rich, out of their Ruins.</P>
<P>THE People who remain'd, and who
are yet numerous, tho' not like what
they were before, apply'd to other Works,
&s;uch as Lace, Linen, and particularly fine
Thread, fine Cambricks, and whatever el&s;e
offer'd, for it mu&s;t be own'd they are a
mo&s;t indu&s;trious People.</P>
<P>THEY are now further reduc'd in their
Bounds by the <HI>French,</HI> who have taken from
them the whole Province of <HI>Artois,</HI> and great
Part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Hainault;</HI> and e&s;pecial|ly,
the Port of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and the great Cities
of <HI>Arras, Cambray, Doway,_Li&s;le,</HI> St.
<HI>Omers,</HI> and many others, &s;o that the remain|ing
Part, which is now call'd the <HI>Netherlands,</HI>
is but &s;mall, compar'd to what
it was; and their Trade is chiefly con|&s;in'd
to the merchandizing Part, which
they carry on by the River Navigation
with <HI>Holland</HI> on one Side, and with <HI>France</HI>
on the other, and by the Manufacture as
above, of Lace and Linen: As to the wool|len
<PB N="135" REF="167">
<HI>len</HI> Manufactures, they are oblig'd to give
them over, and to buy them of their Sup|planters
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to whom they for|merly
&s;old them.</P>
<P>THIS being the antient State of our
Commerce, and from which it deriv'd its
Being, I thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
give this Summary of it, that we may have
no Occa&s;ion to look back any more, but
begin the Plan of its &s;ub&s;equent Improve|ments
at this general <HI>Epocha,</HI> as from its
real Fountain Head, and as it is properly
an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce.</P>
<P>THE Improvements of our Trade from
this Time are no le&s;s wonderful; its pre|&s;ent
Magnitude I call a Prodigy, and I
think it well de&s;erves that Name. How it
come to arrive to &s;uch a Height, and how
it may be farther improved and increa&s;ed in
Spite of all the Prohibitions and Encroach|ments
of its Neighbours, remains to be di&s;|cours'd
of.</P>

<P>_IN the la&s;t Chapter, I mention'd
the Inclination Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>
had to propagate the Interest of
her People; and e&s;pecially, that
of their Commerce. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here,
as an additional Remark, that this Warmth
of the Queen their Sovereign, fir'd her Sub|jects
with an inexpre&s;&s;ible Ardor for new
Di&s;coveries, planting Colonies, finding out
unknown Pa&s;&s;ages, &s;ettling Factories, en|gaging
in new Corre&s;pondences for Trade,
and the like; and in this Reign, and in
pur&s;uit of this new Principle, (for it was
new at that Time,) they began &s;everal of
the pre&s;ent mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Branches of
our pre&s;ent Commerce, and where our
woollen Manufactures are now be&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd:
<HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>1. THE Queen &s;ending an Emba&s;&s;y, as I
have &s;aid, to <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chants
<PB N="137" REF="169">
obtain'd Licen&s;es of the Great Duke
for a certain Number of them to pa&s;s with
their Merchandize thro' his va&s;t Dominions
into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where they carried their <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Cloth, Ker&s;eys, Bays, Says, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
&s;old them to great Advantage, and brought
back their Returns by the &s;ame Way 2500
Miles upon the River <HI>Wolga,</HI> 800 Miles up|on
the <HI>Dwina</HI> to <HI>Arch-Angel;</HI> be&s;ides cro&s;|&s;ing
the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and be&s;ides their Jour|ney
by Land to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI> The&s;e were af|terwards
call'd the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia Company,</HI> and
indeed, they carry'd on a very noble and
gainful Commerce, as well to them&s;elves,
as to their Country, till it was afterwards
interrupted by the meer ab&s;olute Tyranny
of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Emperor or Great Duke,
without any Offence given, and without
&s;o much as a Pretence of any.</P>
<P>THIS Journey, be&s;ides the Voyage by
Sea, between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI>
then al&s;o newly di&s;cover'd, was five Times
perform'd by one Merchant of <HI>London,</HI>
who&s;e Name was <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> as may at
large be &s;een in <HI>Huckluyt</HI>'s, <HI>Voyages.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE Queen having by an Amba&s;&s;ador,
as I have &s;aid, e&s;tabli&s;h'd a Treaty of Peace
and Commerce with <HI>Solyman the magnifi|cent,</HI>
the Great Emperor of the <HI>Turks;</HI> Her
Merchants immediately follow'd with their
Ships; and the <HI>Turky</HI> Company being by
that means erected and e&s;tabli&s;h'd, they &s;et|tled
their Factories at <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smir|na,</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="170">
and at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> where the Trade flou|ri&s;h'd
and encrea&s;ed to a very great Mag|nitude,
and continues to this Day.</P>
<P>3. THE War with <HI>Spain</HI> encouraging
her Maje&s;ty's Subjects to farther Adven|tures,
partly for Repri&s;als upon the <HI>Spani|ard,</HI>
and partly for Di&s;coveries, Sir <HI>Wal|ter
Raleigh, Drake, Smith,</HI> and others,
upon the meer Account of Commerce, di&s;|cover'd
and planted the great, and now
flouri&s;hing Colonies of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s-<HI>Bay, New-England,
Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Burmoodas,</HI> with
the Fi&s;hery or <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> the Mag|nitude
and Commerce of which Countries,
is not ea&s;ily to be de&s;cribed; and to which
are &s;ince then added, the I&s;land Colonies
of <HI>America,</HI> called in common the <HI>We&s;t|Indies,</HI>
&s;uch as <HI>Barbadoes, Nevis, Antegoa,</HI>
St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers, &amp;c.</HI> and at la&s;t <HI>Jamaica;</HI>
and upon the Continent, <HI>New-York,</HI> with
Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> obtain'd by Con|que&s;t
from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Pen&s;ilvania</HI>
and <HI>Carolina,</HI> obtain'd by more modern
and extended Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>TO and from the&s;e, the Advantage of
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce is &s;uch at this Time
in the Con&s;umption of <HI>European</HI> Goods
&s;ent thither, and particularly the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Pro|duct,
and their Manufactures of Linen,
Woollen and Silk; in the Numbers of Sea|men
and Ships employ'd, and in the Re|turns
made from thence, as al&s;o the va&s;t
Wealth acquir'd there in Plantations, Build|ings,
<PB N="139" REF="171">
Value of Lands, Slaves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it
is a Doubt not ea&s;ily re&s;olv'd, whether is
greater in real Value, the Silver returned
to <HI>Spain</HI> yearly by the Galleons, or the Su|gars,
Ginger, Tobacco, Rice, Furrs, Fi&s;h, and
other Product of <HI>America</HI> returned to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and to other Parts on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Account.</P>
<P>TO &s;uch an immen&s;e Greatne&s;s is the
Trade grown, &s;uch a Con&s;umption is made
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchandizes, &s;uch Cities
and Towns are built, Countries, nay King|doms
peopled and inhabited, and &s;uch a
Fund of Wealth and Commerce is rai&s;ed,
that it is not to be e&s;timated.</P>
<P>4. IN the &s;ame enterpri&s;ing Times, was
the Trade to the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI>
begun; a Trade founded upon the mo&s;t: clear
Principles of Commerce; namely, the mean|e&s;t
Export exchang'd for the riche&s;t Re|turn;
a Trade carry'd on with &s;urpri&s;ing
Succe&s;s, while ju&s;tly countenanc'd by the
Authority which own'd its beginning; and
a Trade &s;till holding up its Head, tho' &s;o
&s;trangely, unaccountably, and contrary to
the true Intere&s;t of Trade in general,
as well as of <HI>England</HI> in particular, aban|don'd
and for&s;aken at la&s;t! And I ask leave
to &s;ay, I think 'tis the only national Advan|tage
in Commerce, which &s;eems to be neg|lected
in <HI>England;</HI> it waits, however, for
better Times; and I cannot doubt, but as
it is capable (were it freed from the Inva|&s;ions
of Interlopers) of being made the
<PB N="140" REF="172">
mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Trade of its kind in the
World; &s;o it will &s;till recover it &s;elf, and
flouri&s;h in a manner few People expect,
becau&s;e they do not &s;ee it po&s;&s;ible; which
however, I &s;hall demon&s;trate, upon proper
Oeca&s;ion, to be both po&s;&s;ible and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>5. BESIDES all the&s;e particular Steps
taken for the Encrea&s;e of Trade, the Ex|port
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures to <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
mention'd above, took its beginning
in this Queen's Reign, by the natural Con|&s;equence
of the commanding Influence the
Queen had over all the Affairs, as well as
in the Affections of the <HI>Dutch:</HI> The
<HI>Hollanders</HI> ador'd the Queen, and e&s;teem'd
her, as &s;he really was, their great Patro|ne&s;s
and Protector, and in Return, they
omitted nothing that would oblige her, or
her People; and particularly the encou|raging
and propagating the Con&s;umption
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture was their par|ticular
Care, knowing they could do no|thing
that could oblige her Maje&s;ty more.</P>
<P>THIS Part was indeed one of the main
Articles, in which the Growth of the Manu|facture
at that Time con&s;i&s;ted; for as to the
re&s;t, tho' they were Foundations on which
the future Greatne&s;s of the Manufacture
of Wool was very much rais'd; yet, as I
&s;aid of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII's Part, &s;o it was
here, it was many Years, and not till long
after the Queen's Death, that the Harve&s;t
of that Spring Time of Trade was reap'd.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="173">
<HI>N. B.</HI> The Succe&s;s of tho&s;e glorious
Attempts for the Encrea&s;e of Com|merce,
and the generous Care for the
Pro&s;perity of the Nation, tho' the I&s;&s;ue
could not be &s;een, or the Advantage be
reap'd till &s;ome Ages after, is a noble
Patern for the Princes, and for the Legi|&s;lature
of the pre&s;ent Age; moving them
to lay &s;uch Foundations, as pre&s;ent
them&s;elves for the future Advantage
of their Subjects, tho' the Benefit &s;hould
not immediately be felt, and tho' the
Pro&s;pect be &s;omething remote, of which
&s;omething farther remains in the De|&s;ign
of this Work.</P>
<P>THESE, I &s;ay, were the Beginnings of
foreign Trade in <HI>England,</HI> and from hence
the home Manufacturers rais'd them&s;elves:
The&s;e were the Beginnings, upon which the
immen&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s carry'd on in <HI>England</HI> at
this time has been rais'd: This was the Time,
when (as I &s;aid above) <HI>England</HI> gave her|&s;elf
a loo&s;e in Trade, and got the Start of
all her Neighbours, and like a &s;trong
Hor&s;e in a Race, who having &s;hot a Head
of the re&s;t at their fir&s;t &s;etting out, by the
Skill of the Rider, holds it all the way, by
meer Strength, as well as Speed.</P>
<P>THE Advantages gain'd by the War with
<HI>Spain,</HI> gave <HI>England</HI> &s;uch a Start of her
Neighbours in this &s;ingle Reign, in mat|ters
of Commerce, as the whole World
could never overtake her in to this Day;
<PB N="142" REF="174">
the Di&s;coveries made in <HI>America</HI> are an
Example of this; <HI>England</HI> began, and be|ing
early, carv'd for her &s;elf, nor did &s;he
lo&s;e her Time; the <HI>French</HI> put in as &s;oon
as they perceiv'd it, but found all the
North Coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> gone, and po&s;&s;e&s;t
by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and were glad to take up
with what was left, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to run into the
great and dangerous Gulph of St. <HI>Law|rence,</HI>
take up with the frozen and
wild Countries of <HI>Canada,</HI> and plant be|hind
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> remote from the Sea, and
out of the Way of Commerce, except by
that one Port; by all which Inconveniences
they have been always &s;o crampt in Trade,
they have made but mean Advances in a
Hundred and fifty Years Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: As to
their <HI>Loui&s;iana</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> it has indeed
been made a Bubble at Home, and but little
better Abroad, having only &s;tarv'd, or o|therwi&s;e
devour'd mo&s;t of the People that
have been &s;ent over to it.</P>
<P>AMONG the I&s;lands the <HI>French</HI> came a
little more timely, and &s;o got a better Share
than any other of their Neighbours, except
the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> for they got <HI>Martinico
Guadaloup, Tortuga,</HI> and a part of St. <HI>Chri|&s;topher,</HI>'s
and &s;everal other Places, which
they pro&s;itably hold to this Day.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> came la&s;t, got little upon
the Continent, and lo&s;t that little they had
got to the <HI>Engli&s;h, viz. New York,</HI> and Ea&s;t
and We&s;t <HI>Jer&s;y;</HI> &s;o that they have nothing
<PB N="143" REF="175">
to call their own on that Side; no, nor have
they one I&s;land of any Con&s;equence; they
got a footing in the <HI>Bra&s;ils</HI> indeed, and
held it above twenty Years, but were driven
out of it again by plain Force, even by the
<HI>Portugue&s;e:</HI> Tho&s;e very People, who on
other Occa&s;ions they &s;o much contemned,
and who, in other Places, they drove before
them, as Wolves di&s;per&s;e a Flock of Sheep.</P>
<P>ALL they have now left in <HI>America,</HI> is
the two &s;mall Colonies of <HI>Surinam</HI> and
<HI>Curacao,</HI> of no Import, or worth naming,
and hardly worth their keeping, except for a
clande&s;tine Trade carried on there with the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Caraccas;</HI> which is
now al&s;o likely to be entirely lo&s;t, and then
the Intrin&s;ick of the Product will be their
only Benefit, which will appear very &s;mall.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, How are the&s;e Colo|nies
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> increas'd and improv'd,
even to &s;uch a Degree, that &s;ome have &s;ug|ge&s;ted,
tho' not for Want of Ignorance, a
Danger of their revolting from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>

<P>IT is true, the Notion is ab&s;urd, and
without Foundation, but &s;erves to confirm
what I. have &s;aid above of the real En|crea&s;e
of tho&s;e Colonies, and of the flou|ri&s;hing
Condition of the Commerce car|ried
on there.</P>
<P>HOW great a Con&s;umption of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>

Colonies been to this Nation? Let the year|ly
Export of all Kinds of Goods from hence
to <HI>New-England, Virginia, Barbadoes,</HI>
and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> be&s;ides all the le&s;&s;er Colo|nies,
be a Proof of it: Above a Thou&s;and
Sail of &s;tout Ships are con&s;tantly running be|tween
<HI>England</HI> and tho&s;e Countries, above
another Thou&s;and are employed in coa&s;ting

and the Continent, including the Fi&s;hing
Trade; be&s;ides the Numbers of Sloops con|tinually
waiting upon the Trade in <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI>
which they tell us are double the
Number of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I have omitted the Trade to <HI>India,</HI> as
an Article made &s;o much le&s;s advantageous
to <HI>England,</HI> by our own Mi&s;management,
than it might have been, that I &s;ee but little
to boa&s;t of in it: But the general Com|merce
is my Bu&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e
Parts where our Manufactures are particu|larly
concerned.</P>
<P>THE next to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> (with whom we
carry on &s;uch an immen&s;e Trade, that it
was affirm'd to the Parliament in a particu|lar
Debate upon that Subject, that they
took off two Millions yearly of our Wool|len

our Trade with <HI>Hamburgh</HI> and the <HI>Baltick</HI>

upon the Manufacture lately appearing
<PB N="145" REF="177">
in <HI>Germany,</HI> in Bar of our Manufacture,
our Trade thither is yet &s;uperior to all the
other Nations; and in a Word is &s;o great,
as perhaps is beyond all Conjecture.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade has been carried on
in the mo&s;t regular Manner imaginable,
from its fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment &s;poken of above:
Its Encrea&s;e is vi&s;ible, and as the Returns are
to be duly e&s;timated, and we can make it
appear to be encrea&s;ed, from thirty or forty
Thou&s;and Pound <HI>Sterling</HI> a Year, to up|wards
of 300000 /. Value in a Year.</P>
<P>The Export of our Manufacture to
<HI>Italy, France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and particu|larly
to <HI>Portugal,</HI> how are they advanc'd
upon the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment made in Queen
<HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Time: It is true, <HI>France,</HI>
by our egregious Folly, is lo&s;t to us in &s;ome
Sen&s;e; but how it is in <HI>Portugal,</HI> by the
Encrea&s;e of their Colonies in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI>
and on both the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa</HI> South
of the Line; I &s;ay, how has the Con&s;ump|tion
of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufacture
encrea&s;ed among them; &s;o that I am a&s;&s;ur'd
the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> alone take off more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Woollen Manufacture at this Time, than ever
<HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> put together, took off
from us before.</P>
<P>The Trade to <HI>Italy,</HI> e&s;pecially to <HI>Leg|horn</HI>
and <HI>Genoa, Me&s;&s;ina</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> is
the &s;ame, and under the &s;ame Proportion
of Improvement. To this Prodigy of Mag|nitude
is the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture arriv'd,
<PB N="146" REF="178">
and all built upon the &s;olid Foundations
layd by that glorious Prince&s;s: She opened
all the&s;e Doors, &s;he &s;ent out all tho&s;e Ad|venturers,
&s;he planted all tho&s;e Colonies,
or made Way for the planting them; &s;he
circled the Globe by her Mariners, &s;he
founded the Commerce of both the <HI>Indies,</HI>
of <HI>Africa,</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> the
<HI>Levant,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick</HI> Seas.</P>
<P>SHE did not live indeed to &s;ee the Ani|mo&s;ity
of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> War abated, much
le&s;s brought to an End, or the Haughtine&s;s
of that proud Nation humbled into a &s;ettled
Friend&s;hip and Commerce, as was after|wards
done; but it was all founded on
her Conduct; for Example,</P>
<P>ON the Foot of her E&s;tabli&s;hments, the
<HI>American</HI> Colonies are &s;ince brought to
that flouri&s;hing State in which we now &s;ee
they &s;tand; on her laying the Foundation
of the <HI>Turkey,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t India,</HI> the <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
and the <HI>Ea&s;t Country</HI> Trades, they
are grown up to what we now &s;ee them.</P>
<P>BUT above all, and what I have not
mentioned before, the Naval Glory of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
is all rai&s;ed upon her prudent exerting
her Strength at Sea; &s;he &s;hew'd the <HI>Spani|ard,</HI>
that however &s;uperior his Forces were
on Shore (and it mu&s;t be allowed his Ar|mies
were at that Time formidable, and
his Troops, as well as his Generals, the be&s;t
in the World) yet, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> her Maje|&s;ty
&s;hew'd him, that her Wooden Walls were
<PB N="147" REF="179">
her &s;ufficient Defence; that &s;he built her
Strength for War as well as for Commerce,
upon the invincible Power of her Fleets,
and the Courage and Bravery of her Sea|men.
By this &s;he carried her Arms to the
Doors of her Enemies, and vi&s;ited them
with her Terrors in their remote&s;t Situ|ation.</P>
<P>By the&s;e &s;he took <HI>Cadiz,</HI> burnt the
<HI>Galleons,</HI> with twenty Millions of Trea|&s;ure
in them, in&s;ulted <HI>Lisbon,</HI> (then in the
Hands of <HI>Spain</HI>) ravaged the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Galitia,</HI> and in a Word made all <HI>Spain</HI>
tremble: By the&s;e &s;he &s;eiz'd the I&s;lands
and planted the Continent, landed upon the
Coa&s;ts, plundered the Cities, de&s;troyed the
Shipping, and took immen&s;e Wealth from
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI></P>
<P>IN a Word, &s;he cover'd the Seas with
her Men of War, and like King <HI>George,</HI>
let the Enemies of <HI>England</HI> &s;ee, that they
that command the Sea, awe the World, and
that to be Ma&s;ters of the marine Power, is to
be Ma&s;ters of all the Power, and all the
Commerce in <HI>Europe, A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> and
<HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>NOR was this all, but the <HI>Queen</HI> by thus ex|erting
her Naval Power, encreas'd it; nay, &s;he
took the be&s;t and the only Way to enlarge
and encrea&s;e it; the Succe&s;s at Sea made Sea|men,
as her Succe&s;s in Trade made Merchants:
To &s;peak the Truth, all her Subjects were
fir'd with new Thoughts; the very No|bility,
<PB N="148" REF="180">
and fir&s;t Rate Gentlemen, fell into
it, the <HI>Cliffords</HI> Earls of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> Sir
<HI>John Hawkins,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendi&s;h,</HI> Sir
<HI>Richard Greenville</HI> of the <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Fa|mily,
&s;ince Earls of <HI>Bath,</HI> the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI>
Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> and Multitudes more:
Some commanded Ships, &s;ome Troops; &s;ome
planted Colonies, &s;ome &s;upply'd Stocks;
&s;ome ventur'd their Lives, &s;ome their
E&s;tates; all &s;omething: The Trade, the
War, the Sea, emulated one another; all
the Nation was in a kind of Flame.</P>
<P>THE Seamen returned enriched with the
Plunder, not of Ships, but of Fleets, Loa|den
with Silver; they went out Beggars,
and came home Gentlemen; nay, the
Wealth they brought Home, not only en|rich'd
them&s;elves, but the whole Nation.</P>
<P>THIS made the People run to Sea, as
Country Folks to a Fair; and all the young
Fellows turn'd Seamen as naturally as if they
had been born &s;o: The Multitude of
Ships and Sailors in <HI>England</HI> grew &s;o great,
that, in a Word, they, as it were, covered
the Seas; every Part of the World was vi|&s;ited,
and the Queen reign'd as it were
Mi&s;tre&s;s the Ocean; nor do we learn by
Hi&s;tory or Tradition, that the Queen ever
pre&s;t any Seamen; Her glorious Succe&s;&s;es at
Sea both in publick and private Adventures,
animated her People &s;o, that they crouded
into the Service on all Hands; and whatever
<PB N="149" REF="181">
Adventure was on Foot, they never wan|ted
Hands.</P>
<P>THUS the Queen, I &s;ay, by exerting her
Naval Strength, encrea&s;ed it; and that to
&s;uch a Degree, that no Power on Earth,
during her whole Reign, was able to match
her at Sea; nay, I believe I do not carry
it too far, if I &s;ay, &s;he was at that Time able
to have fought all the Maritime Powers of
Chri&s;tendom at Sea, had they been all in
Confederacy together; and this I &s;peak of
the Number of her Seamen and Ships, not
at all in&s;i&s;ting on the Goodne&s;s of her Sea|men;
tho' it mu&s;t be allow'd, that her Sea|men,
flu&s;h'd with <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prizes, were the
be&s;t and the bolde&s;t at that Time, of any
Sailors in the World: But that is a Subject
by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>I return to the Subject; as it is now,
&s;o it was then; <HI>Spain</HI> could not bring
home her <HI>American</HI> Trea&s;ures, without her
Maje&s;ty's Leave; and with this addition
too, that almo&s;t as often as they ventur'd
to do it, they mi&s;carried; which has not
yet been our Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>HERE began the formidable Strength,
as well as Trade of <HI>England,</HI> to &s;hew it &s;elf,
the World &s;carce ever heard of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Navy till then; the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the
fifth had powerful Fleets, when he carried
on his Wars with &s;o much Glory again&s;t
<HI>France,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> (then very for|midable
at Sea) and again&s;t the Rovers of
<PB N="150" REF="182">
<HI>Tunis</HI> and <HI>Algier;</HI> and his Son King <HI>Philip</HI>
had indeed great Navies, when he car|ried
on his Wars again&s;t the <HI>Dutch,</HI> not
then form'd into a State; and when he fit|ted
that terrible Fleet again&s;t <HI>England,</HI>
called <HI>Invincible,</HI> and which had been
truly invincible, had not Heaven and
Earth, as it were, fought again&s;t it in Con|junction.</P>
<P>BUT the World &s;carce ever heard of an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War (&s;o by the Iniquity
of Cu&s;tom we call our Ships of War)
much le&s;s of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navy till Queen
<HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>WITH our naval Power grew up our
Commerce, as if like Twins they were born
together, and not to live a&s;under: What
had been all her new &s;ettled Plantations,
all her Infant Colonies? they had Difficul|ties
almo&s;t un&s;urmountable in their very
Beginning, Difficulties found in the very
Nature of their Undertakings, and which
follow'd in the Con&s;equence of the Thing;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) planting among the barbarous Nations,
and lying at the Mercy of the Savages: How
often fami&s;h'd, and frozen to Death by the
Severity of the Climates, and Want of Sup|plies?
How often ma&s;&s;acred by the treache|rous
Natives? How often driven, to aban|don
the Settlements they had made? And
had the <HI>Spaniard</HI> too been able to have at|tack'd
them by Sea, had not the Queen al|ways
kept her&s;elf in a Condition to defend
<PB N="151" REF="183">
them, and to protect their Commerce, all
the Di&s;coveries they had made, and the
Colonies they had planted, like ill Births
had been &s;trangled in the bringing forth;
and all had fallen back to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
by the meer Con&s;equence of their Naval
Power.</P>
<P>BUT the Queen was the Life of all that
Glory; her adventurous Subjects found out
the Places, planted and &s;ettled them, and as
well as they could, fortified them&s;elves a|gain&s;t
the Bow and Arrow Enemies, which
they found in the Place.</P>
<P>BUT 'twas the Queen's <HI>Naval Strength</HI>
that was their Security; by this &s;he kept
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Hands full, that they had no
Time to be&s;tow in attacking the newly
planted Merchants; nor had they Ships to
&s;pare, they were met with in every Cor|ner,
fought with on every Coa&s;t, and which
was more, beaten almo&s;t as often as fought
with, on whatever Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>UNDER this Protection the Commerce
encrea&s;ed, Trade got Ground, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Nation &s;welled into an Empire of Nations,
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants carried a ge|neral
Negoce to all the Quarters of the
World.</P>
<P>HAVING thus look'd back a little upon
Things pa&s;t, I &s;hall &s;ay a Word or two to
Things pre&s;ent, and conclude with Things
yet to come.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the pre&s;ent State of the Engli&s;h
Commerce, e&s;pecially that Part of
it which relates to the woollen Ma|nufacture;
the Prodigy of its Mag|nitude,
and &s;ome Enquiry into how
it may be call'd great, and what
that Magnitude really is.</HEAD>
<P>_ BY what has been &s;aid, we are a
little let into the Beginning of
Things, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of
Trade may &s;ee their glorious Ori|ginal;
how they receiv'd Life, as we may
call it, from the Powerful Influences, and
Paternal Concern of their &s;agacious Princes;
and how they became a trading Nation.
Take a Summary of it again in the following
Ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>HEAVEN be&s;tow'd the Wool upon them,
the Life and Soul, the Original of all their
Commerce; he gave it them, and gave It
exclu&s;ive of all the Nations in the World;
for none comes up to it.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="185">
<HI>Their King (Henry</HI> VII.) open'd their
Eyes to the Ble&s;&s;ing, and put them upon
manufacturing it, a&s;ter they had, for almo&s;t
a Thou&s;and Years of Ignorance, &s;old it to
the diligent <HI>Flemings;</HI> and even bought
their own Cloaths of them again, after they
were made with it Abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Their</HI> glorious <HI>Queen, (Elizabeth</HI>) &s;hew|ed
them the Way to find a Market for it,
when manufactur'd; &s;he open'd the Sluices
of Trade to them, and Trade open'd the
Sluices of Money. In a Word, &s;he made
them a Trading Nation, and that has made
them a rich Nation, as we &s;ee them at this
Time.</P>
<P>BUT I am called upon to de&s;cribe the
Magnitude of this Commerce, and &s;hew
the World, that we do not boa&s;t of its
Greatne&s;s without Cau&s;e; that Strangers
may know, what we &s;ay of it, is not made
up of Blu&s;ter and Wind, and that even tho&s;e
that read it among our own People, may be
able to &s;upport and explain what they &s;hall,
upon any Occa&s;ion, advance of the real
Greatne&s;s of our Trade.</P>
<P>THE Funds of Trade in any Nation, and
upon which the Commerce that is rais'd,
is with Propriety &s;aid to be the Trade of
that Nation, mu&s;t be contain'd in the&s;e
Two.</P>
<P>THE Produce of the Soil, and,
THE Labour of the People.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="186">
Now, if I make it appear, that in both the&s;e
the Trade of <HI>England</HI> is greater than that
of any other Nation, I hope I may be &s;up|po&s;ed
&s;ufficiently to have prov'd the Mag|nitude
of it.</P>
<P>1. THE Produce of the Soil.</P>
<P>AND here, that I may make all Things
plain and ea&s;y as I go, and leave as little
Room for Cavil as po&s;&s;ible, I demand
to explain briefly the Term <HI>Product</HI> or Pro|duce:
By Produce, as to Trade, I am to be
under&s;tood to mean, not that Part of our
Produce, be it of what Kind it will, that is
con&s;umed at Home, and is employ'd by our
People; for this does not relate to the Trade
of the Kingdom, as I under&s;tand Trade in
this Di&s;cour&s;e; that is to &s;ay, Our foreign
Trade: By this Exception I take out all the
va&s;t Con&s;umption of Corn, Cattle, Coal,
Fi&s;h, Fowl, or whatever of our own Growth
is con&s;um'd unmanufactur'd; and tho' this
makes an inexpre&s;&s;ible Sum, and employs a
Multitude of tho&s;e of our People we call
Shop-keepers, Carriers, Coa&s;ting Sailors,
with Servants, Labourers and Hor&s;es; Ships,
Barges Boats, Carts and Carriages in|numerable,
and that a va&s;t Wealth is rai&s;ed
by this part of Trade; yet, I &s;ay, this is not
the Article, or Branch of our Trade that I am
in particular now de&s;cribing: But by the
Produce of the Soil here, I mean &s;uch part
of its Growth as is exported beyond the
<PB N="155" REF="187">
Seas. What is con&s;um'd at Home, will
come under another Head. This includes,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WOOL, the greate&s;t and be&s;t of our

<P>THE Magnitude of our Trade, founded
upon the&s;e Productions, will appear, when

&s;hall &s;o far double and redouble the
<PB N="156" REF="188">

&s;hall admit.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Labour of the People</HI> is the next
Article. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to be rated accor|ding
to the Thing they labour about, and
is to be added to the intrin&s;ick Value of the
Materials; which being &s;o join'd, the Work
fini&s;h'd is call'd Manufacture.</P>
<P>1. The Wool, as it is the fir&s;t and greate&s;t
Produce, &s;o it is the fir&s;t and principal Ma|nufacture;
an E&s;timate of its Value, as
Wool, is as difficult to be made, as of its
Quantity; the Numbers of People it em|ploys
are not to be reckon'd by Thou&s;ands,
but by Millions; the Places in <HI>Britain</HI>
where the Work is managed and carried on,
are not to be mea&s;ured by Towns, and Di|&s;tricts
of Towns, Villages, or Lord&s;hips,
but by Counties, Provinces, Parts and
Quarters of the I&s;land: As it is a Product
every where; &s;o every where we &s;ee more
or le&s;s of the People employ'd in it: The
be&s;t Mea&s;ure we can take to give you an
Idea of its Magnitude, is to tell you, that
it works up, and con&s;umes not only all the
Wool produced by the Sheep of this whole
I&s;land, the <HI>Cattle upon a thou&s;and Hills,</HI>
but it calls for a prodigious quantity from
Abroad.</P>
<P>N. B. I &s;uppo&s;e I am much within Com|pa&s;s,
when I &s;ay, that in the Fleece
and in Yarn, we import 100000 Packs
of Wool every year from <HI>Ireland,</HI> be|&s;ides

<P>They that would examine into the Quan|tity
of Wool u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> mu&s;t make an
E&s;timate of the Numbers of the Sheep fed
here, which it would be very hard to do;
but let them view the Country where tho&s;e
Sheep are generally rais'd and fed, or enquire

Sea Shore South, to <HI>Warchorn</HI> North, which
is &s;uppos'd to be a Medium of the Breadth,
at lea&s;t ten Miles.</P>
<P>As all (or all to a Trifle of) this Land, is
employ'd in breeding and feeding of Sheep,
they reckon the &s;tated Number of Sheep to
Stock, the whole, that is to &s;ay, of Wea|thers
and Ewes, which produce Fleece
Wool, is three Sheep to an Acre.</P>
<P>N. B. THE Lambs, of which a very
great Number, are every Year &s;old off,
are not included.</P>
<P>So that the Number of Sheep, and con&s;e|quently
the Number of Fleeces of Wool
rai&s;ed in this <HI>Level,</HI> is 141330 Fleeces.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e 'tis u&s;ually reckon'd, that 14
Fleeces, one with another, make a Draft,
and four Drafts make a Pack of Wool; &s;o
<PB N="158" REF="191">
that 56 Fleeces make a Pack, each Pack
weighing 240 Pound; and, thus</P>
<P>THE Total of the yearly Growth of
Fleece Wool in this <HI>Level,</HI> is 2523 Packs
23 Fleeces.</P>
<P>I could give many more E&s;timates of par|ticular
Places after the like manner; but, as
all together will not amount to an exact
Calculate, I &s;hall not trouble the Reader
with Figures. This is &s;ufficient to give you
&s;ome ju&s;t Ideas of the re&s;t, after I have a
little de&s;crib'd the Countries where the Prin|cipal
Numbers of Sheep are kept.</P>
<P>2. THE South <HI>Downs;</HI> an Extent of Car|pet
Ground, reaching from <HI>Bourn</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI>
to near <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> and with &s;mall Intervals
to <HI>Po&s;t Down</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> being at lea&s;t
65 Miles in length, and generally 5 or 6
Miles broad at a Medium; all covered with
Sheep of a &s;maller Size, but of the fine&s;t
Wool; in which Compa&s;s I find there is
e&s;timated above 70000 Acres.</P>
<P>3. THE <HI>Downs</HI> and <HI>Plains,</HI> vulgarly call'd
<HI>Salisbury Plains,</HI> but extending from about
10 Miles on this &s;ide <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> to the <HI>Divi|zes</HI>
Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and from <HI>Andover</HI> on the
Edge of <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> through the whole
Counties of <HI>Wilts</HI> and <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> to the Sea at
<HI>Weymouth,</HI> North and South; containing all,
or the mo&s;t Part of the large Counties of
<HI>Southampton;</HI> be&s;ides, as above, that of <HI>Wilts</HI>
and <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> the Number of Acres not to
<PB N="160" REF="192">
be e&s;timated, and the Sheep not to be
gue&s;&s;ed at.</P>
<P>4. THE <HI>Cot&s;would</HI> Hills and the Plains ad|joining,
in the Counties of <HI>Worce&s;ter, Glou|ce&s;ter</HI>
and <HI>Oxford;</HI> all the&s;e la&s;t Counties
breed an infinite Number of Sheep.</P>
<P>5. THE County of <HI>Surry</HI> breeds a very
great Number on <HI>Ban&s;ted Downs;</HI> and al&s;o on
the va&s;t extended Commons and Heaths on
the We&s;t Part of the &s;ame Country, towards
<HI>Farnham, Guildford,</HI> and the <HI>Hind Head
Hills,</HI> all to be &s;een on the Road to <HI>Port&s;|mouth.</HI></P>
<P>6. THE two rich feeding Counties of <HI>Lin|coln</HI>
and <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> where the large&s;t Sheep
in <HI>England</HI> are bred, and from whence
comes that innumerable Store which &s;upplies
the Markets of <HI>London</HI> with their Fle&s;h,
who&s;e Number admits of no Calculation.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Newmarket Heath,</HI> and all tho&s;e Downs
and Heaths adjoining in the Counties of
<HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Norfolk,</HI> which reach from
<HI>Bourn Bridge</HI> on the &s;ide of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to <HI>Thet|ford</HI>
North Ea&s;t, and on by <HI>Brandon</HI> and to
<HI>Lyn</HI> North We&s;t, and to the Sea due North,
where an innumerable Number of Sheep
are fed, noted for having all white Wool, but
black Faces.</P>
<P>I forbear to examine the Mountains of
<HI>Wales,</HI> the fine Wool of <HI>Leomin&s;ter,</HI> the
<HI>Woulds</HI> in the Ea&s;t Riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI>
the Bank of <HI>Tees</HI> in the Bi&s;hoprick of
<HI>Durham,</HI> where are the large&s;t Breed of
<PB N="161" REF="193">
Sheep in the whole I&s;land; even larger
than in <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> or <HI>Romney Mar&s;h;</HI>
and la&s;t of all the <HI>Northumberland</HI> Sheep,
where, and in <HI>Cumberland</HI> their Number is
&s;o great, that they are brought Southward to
be &s;old, even to <HI>London</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>ADD to all the&s;e, that at lea&s;t there is
brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> 120000 Sheep eve|ry
Year, with the Wool upon their Backs,
be&s;ides Wool, as I &s;aid before, of all the
numberle&s;s Flocks that are left behind, in
the Shires of <HI>Galloway, Air, Nith&s;dale,
Tiviotdale,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be foreign to our purpo&s;e, to
mention the&s;e particular Sheep Countries,
if there were not &s;omething material in it,
to tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men who are acquainted a
little with their own Country; and who
by reflecting on the Quantities of Sheep,
may make &s;ome Gue&s;s at the prodigious
Quantity of Wool produced by them; as
an Illu&s;tration of which, be pleas'd to ob|&s;erve.</P>
<P>1. THAT at <HI>Dorche&s;ter,</HI> the County
Town of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> abovemention'd, I
was told by very grave and creditable Per|&s;ons,
Inhabitants of that Town, that upon
a Wager decided, it was made appear, that
within a Circle drawn round the Town,
&s;ix Miles every Way; that is, twelve
Miles Diameter, placing the Town exclu|&s;ive
in the Center, there were 600000 Sheep
<PB N="162" REF="194">
feeding at that one Time, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>June,
Anno</HI> 1673.</P>
<P>2. THAT at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> I received an
Account from Per&s;ons alike grave and ju|dicious,
that there were &s;old, or brought to
be &s;old, at one Time at <HI>Wey-hill</HI> Fair,
400000 Sheep; and at <HI>Burford</HI> Fair in
<HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> the &s;ame Year, upwards of
600000.</P>
<P>THE Sum of this Account is, that as the
Number of Sheep, which are con&s;tantly kept
in this I&s;land, is &s;o exceeding great, and as
we may &s;ay, numberle&s;s; &s;o mu&s;t the
Growth of the Wool be yearly in Propor|tion;
and how great then mu&s;t be the
Manufacture, which not only works the
Wool always up, but receives &s;uch immen&s;e
Quantities from <HI>Ireland</HI> and from <HI>Scotland?</HI></P>
<P>THE next Con&s;ideration upon which,
to form an Idea of the Greatne&s;s of our
woollen Manufacture, is the Exportation
of it, and the &s;everal Markets where it is
&s;old: For Example,</P>
<P>THE Markets for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> broad Cloths
in <HI>Turky,</HI> viz. at <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyrna,
Scanderoon, Aleppo,</HI> and at <HI>Alexandria</HI> in
<HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>THE Staple at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> the Fairs at
<HI>Leip&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Frankfort au Main,</HI> and the
Markets of <HI>Ausburgh, Nuremburgh, &V;lm,</HI>
and many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Cities
of the upper, as well as the lower <HI>Ger|many.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="195">
THE great Quantity of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma|nufacture
&s;old yearly at <HI>Lubec, Gottenburgh,
Stockholm, Strael&s;and, Stetin, Konings|burgh,
Dantzick, Riga</HI> and <HI>Petersburgh;</HI>
and this, notwith&s;tanding all the Prohibi|tions,
and pretended Imitations of our
Manufacture in <HI>Sweden, Pru&s;&s;ia, Saxony</HI>
and <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>THE incredible Vent for the woollen
Manufacture of <HI>England,</HI> which is now
actually in <HI>Holland,</HI> as well at <HI>Rotterdam</HI>
as at <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> and from thence it is
&s;ent to all the Provinces and Counties of
<HI>Germany;</HI> which, as I have &s;aid above, is
&s;aid to amount to above two Millions Ster|ling
<HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>THE lately encreas'd Market at <HI>Lisbon,</HI>
where, notwith&s;tanding all that has been
&s;aid of the <HI>French</HI> &s;upplying them, we
have &s;o great a Vent for the woollen Ma|nufacture,
that 'tis &s;aid, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade
is at this Time the be&s;t, and mo&s;t entire
Trade we have.</P>
<P>THE Trade to <HI>Spain,</HI> as well old as new,
and to <HI>Italy;</HI> however, the fir&s;t has been
interrupted, either by clande&s;tine or Per|mi&s;&s;ion'd
Traders: I &s;ay, it is very con|&s;iderable;
and it is ob&s;ervable, that our
Importation of woollen Manufactures into
old <HI>Spain,</HI> much over-ballances all the
Goods we bring back from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
their Bullion only excepted.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="196">
THE Trade to <HI>India,</HI> with all its Faults,
in which the Company oblige them&s;elves
to export yearly, the Value of 100000.
Pound in woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>ADD to all this, the Con&s;umption in our
own Colonies and Plantations, which, as
has been already ob&s;erv'd, is beyond the
reach of all Calculation.</P>
<P>THUS far relates to the fir&s;t Article of
the Employment or Labour of the Poor,
<HI>viz.</HI> the woollen Manufacture only.</P>
<P>2. THE Silk Manufacture; this is en|creas'd
in <HI>England</HI> within a few Years to
&s;uch a Degree, that whereas it was a&s;&s;ert|ed
by the late Dr. <HI>d'Avenant,</HI> and others,
that in the Years 1680, 1681, 1682, there
was imported yearly, by a Medium of three
Years, above 1200000 Pound <HI>per Annum,</HI>
Sterling in Value, in wrought Silks from
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> I am a&s;&s;ured, that at
this Time, there are not twelve thou&s;and
Pounds fir&s;t Co&s;t, imported in a Year from
<HI>France,</HI> and from <HI>Italy</HI> le&s;s than ever, ex|cept
what may be run in by Smuggling,
which, we have Rea&s;on to believe, is not
con&s;iderable: It is true, this is a Manu|facture
wrought from foreign Materials;
but it has two Particulars attending, ex|tremely
advantageous in Trade, and which
ballances all that can be &s;aid again&s;t it.</P>
<P>1. THAT the foreign Materials are &s;uch
as are imported manife&s;tly in Return for
our Manufacture exported; as particularly
<PB N="165" REF="197">
the Raw-Silk from <HI>Turky</HI> and the <HI>Levant,</HI>
and the Thrown-Silk from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Si|cily.</HI></P>
<P>2. THAT the Labour of our own Peo|ple
is employ'd on the making tho&s;e Goods,
which, however they may be con&s;um'd at
Home, yet, would otherwi&s;e be bought
from Foreigners with our Money; &s;o that
by this Labour of our People, the Sum of
more than a Million Sterling <HI>per Annum</HI> is
&s;av'd; if it is not gain'd, 'tis kept at home,
in&s;tead of being &s;ent abroad, and the Bal|lance
of our foreign Trade turn'd &s;o much
the more in our Favour.</P>
<P>THUS far the Con&s;umption at home is
made a Branch of our Gain; and the La|bour
of the People, tho' expended by the &s;ame
People, is made a means to keep a Million
of Money at home, which would other wi&s;e
go aboad in Levity and Trifles.</P>
<P>BUT I return to foreign Trade.</P>
<P>3. THE Labour of our People is con|cern'd
in foreign Trade, in all our Hard|Ware
Manufactures, &s;o far as tho&s;e Hard|Ware
Manufactures are exported; and this,
if ca&s;t up in Form, and containing all
our wrought Iron, Copper and Bra&s;s, and
wrought Pewter, is a very great Article in the
general Commerce; be&s;ides the many thou|&s;and
Families employ'd in the Mines, in
digging Lead, Tin, Iron, Copper and Coal,
for Exportation; that is to &s;ay, the Lead in
Sows or Pigs, call it as you plea&s;e, the
<PB N="166" REF="198">
Tin in Blocks, and the Copper in Bars and
Plates.</P>
<P>4. THE Labour of the People in the Fi&s;he|ry
of all Sorts, in which, tho' we do not
come up to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who they tell us
employ 10000 Seamen every Year in the
Whale Fi&s;hing, and 10000 more in the
Herring Fi&s;hing, and 10000 more in all
their other Fi&s;hing, including the fetch|ing
Salt from St. <HI>&V;vies;</HI> yet, it is certain,
that next to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> we have more
Men employ'd in the taking and curing
of Fi&s;h, including the <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and
<HI>New-England</HI> Fi&s;hing, than all the World
be&s;ides.</P>
<P>5. ADD to this, that <HI>England</HI> employs,
without Que&s;tion, more Shipping than any
other Nation, even than the <HI>Dutch</HI> them|&s;elves;
and con&s;equently more Seamen, and
Builders of Ships; for tho' the <HI>Dutch</HI> have
an infinite Number of &s;mall Craft, &s;uch as
Galliots, Hoys, Bu&s;&s;es, and Bylanders or
Hoys, for their River Navigation, in which
they and the <HI>Flemings</HI> out-do all the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI>
World; yet &s;or great Ships, and
Ships of Force &s;or the Merchants Trade,
they cannot come near us; our coa&s;ting
Trade for Coals, our <HI>We&s;t-India, Spani&s;h,</HI>
and <HI>Straits</HI> Trade, which is all carry'd on
in large Ships, carrying from ten to thirty
Guns, or able to carry &s;o many, and &s;ome
36 to 40 Guns, e&s;pecially the Trade to <HI>Vir|ginia,
Jamaica, Barbadoes, Spain, Italy</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="199">
and <HI>Turkey,</HI> in which many Ships are em|ploy'd,
which, in times of a &s;udden Rupture,
have been hir'd and taken up for Ships of
War, and are very fit to be &s;o.</P>
<P>HERS the Strength, as well as the Wealth
of this I&s;land, is di&s;covered; and I need not
add, that out of this extraordinary Number
of Ships employ'd in our Commerce, the
Government, with very little Compul&s;i|on,
and le&s;s now than ever, is able to man
any Squadron of Ships of War; nay, if
need be, the whole royal Navy with unex|ampled
Expedition.</P>
<P>And this is another unan&s;werable convin|cing
Argument to prove the Magnitude of
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that if the
King wants 20000 to 30000 Seamen for the
Fleet, they are always to be had; the Trade
&s;upplies them, and the continued Train of
homeward bound Ships produces them, and
yet the Merchants always find Men for
their Bu&s;ine&s;s; on the other hand, if
Peace returns, and the Royal Navy lies up,
if 20000 Seamen are di&s;mi&s;s'd and paid off,
they are gone in a few Minutes, they find a
Birth, (as they call it) in Trade, the Mer|chants
fit out the more Ships, and good Sea|men
never want Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS could never be, if the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Trade was not a Prodigy for its Magnitude;
what Difficulties was the late King of <HI>France,</HI>
a Prince born to &s;urmount all Difficulties,
I &s;ay, what Shifts was he put to to find, or
<PB N="168" REF="200">
rather to make Seamen to man his Ships at
the beginning of his late fatal Greatne&s;s?
How did he oblige all his Merchant Ships to
carry more Men than their Complement
(or Compleatment) to Sea upon every Voy|age?
and be&s;ides that, a certain Number &s;till
more upon the King's Account, and paid
by the Royal Trea&s;ury, that tho&s;e Men be|ing
inur'd to the Sea, might be afterwards
fit for his Service.</P>
<P>HOW did he invite foreign Sailors, e&s;pe|cially
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> to &s;erve in his Fleet,
by Offers of Preferment, and extraordinary
Wages, manning his be&s;t Ships with &s;uch,
becau&s;e he found them better and more ex|perienc'd
Seamen than his own Subjects?</P>
<P>EVEN the <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves, if a War
pre&s;ents, as was the Ca&s;e more than once in
their former Wars with <HI>England,</HI> and was in
1689, and 1690, are oblig'd to &s;top their
<HI>Greenland</HI> Fleet, and even &s;ometimes their
Herring Fi&s;hery, or, at lea&s;t, to &s;horten the
Number, in order to man their Fleets.</P>
<P>WHEREAS the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;ome &s;mall Em|bargoes
excepted, for a Week or ten Days
at a Time, never put a full Stop to any general
Head of Trade, for want of Seamen; on
the contrary, in the hotte&s;t Pre&s;s, and
when Seamen are wanting on any &s;udden
Expedition, yet they grant Exemptions and
Protections, upon the ordinary Repre&s;enta|tions
of the Merchants and of the Cities
and Towns; as, to the Coal Trade from
<PB N="169" REF="201">
<HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> the Mackrel and Herring-Fi&s;h|ing
Smacks in their Sea&s;ons, and to their
outward bound Merchants on many Occa|&s;ions:
And this was done in the late King
<HI>William</HI>'s Time, even when the Govern|ment
required 40000 Seamen to man the
Fleet, and when two or three Hundred
Ships at a Time were employed in the
Tran&s;port Service to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and other
Places.</P>
<P>How could this be, if the Magnitude
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade was not, as I have
&s;aid, a Kind of Prodigy in the World, &s;uch
as is no where now to be equalled, or was
ever before heard of?</P>
<P>THESE I take to be &s;olid Proofs of the
general Propo&s;ition; they are no Rhodo|montades
or Boa&s;ts; the Ca&s;e does not
want &s;uch mean Helps to &s;et it out; the
Thing is not private and conceal'd, for a
few to know and be called upon to give in
Evidence, the whole World are Witne&s;&s;es;
where to the Southward of our Channel is
the Port or the Place of Trade, in <HI>Europe,
Africa</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> where among all fo|reign
Ships that enter their Harbours, the
<HI>Engi&s;h</HI> are not the mo&s;t in Number? at <HI>Li&s;|bon,</HI>
at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> at <HI>Malaga,</HI> at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> at
<HI>Leghorn,</HI> at <HI>Genoa,</HI> at <HI>Zant,</HI> at <HI>Venice;</HI>

than of any other Nation, but generally
more than of all the other Nations

<P>THESE I call Demon&s;trations of the
Greatne&s;s of our Commerce in general;
'tis true it is not a Detail of Particulars,
neither is it needful to our Subject.</P>
<P>I have met with &s;ome who have preten|ded
to be critical in tho&s;e Things, and have
made E&s;timates of the Value of the Wool|len
Manufacture in the whole; and they
<PB N="171" REF="203">
have told us, that they allow it to be five
Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> exported, and two Mil|lions
<HI>Sterling</HI> the Home Con&s;umption.
The&s;e Calculations I take to be much of a
Piece with tho&s;e general Gue&s;&s;es formerly
made at the Value of our old Coin; &s;ome
would have it to be three Millions, and
others four; and the la&s;t pretended to &s;peak
with Judgment, and with a Kind of Au|thority,
and took upon them to make the
World believe they knew &s;omething more
than common.</P>
<P>FROM this a&s;&s;uming po&s;itive Way they
went on, to make a Judgment of other pub|lick
Things, as the Proportion of People,
the Value of Lands, the Number of Acres
in <HI>England,</HI> and what &s;uch and &s;uch
Taxes might rai&s;e; by all which it pa&s;t
with the World as a ju&s;t Calculation, that
the current Coin was 4 Millions of Silver
Money; and when upon the&s;e Pre&s;umpti|ons
they adventur'd upon that great Work
of reforming the Coin, and calling in the
old Money, they found the Sum nearer
to twelve Millions than to four; which
Mi&s;take plung'd the famous Mr. <HI>Montague,</HI>
afterwards Lord <HI>H&mdash;x,</HI> into unexpe|cted
Difficulties, which required his ut|mo&s;t
Skill to go thro', and which a Genius
le&s;s than his, would have been in Danger
to have been &s;unk under.</P>
<P>CALCULATIONS in Ca&s;es where there
is no Principle to calculate from, no given
<PB N="172" REF="204">
Number or Rule to begin at, &s;hould never
obtain too much upon us; the judging
by or from &s;uch Calculations leads Men,
or otherwi&s;e great Penetration, oftentimes
into fatal Mi&s;takes, &s;uch as at lea&s;t touch
the Reputation of their Understandings
and Judgment; and &s;ometimes &s;uch as ex|po&s;e
them to Contempt; &s;uch were the
Gue&s;&s;es of that great Pretender to politick
Arithmetick, Sir <HI>William Petty,</HI> who&s;e
Calculations of the Numbers of the Hou&s;es,
and Families, and Inhabitants in <HI>London,</HI>
and other populous Cities, were not erro|neous
only, but we may &s;ay have been
&s;ince prov'sd ab&s;urd, and even ridiculous.</P>
<P>I give therefore no Heed to tho&s;e Gue&s;|&s;es
of five Millions and two Millions, in
the Account of the Value of our Manu|facture,
there being no Rule or Foundation
to make &s;uch an E&s;timate upon, and it may
be too little or too much, none knows
whether.</P>
<P>BUT all this, without Impeachment of
my general Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Mag|nitude
of our Woollen Manufacture is a
Prodigy in Trade.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore be allowed here to enter
into &s;ome Compari&s;ons, and to talk by Allu|&s;ion
in Behalf of this particular Branch of
our Commerce, and that is, that it is not
only prodigious great, but that it by far
out-does, and goes beyond any &s;ingle Branch
of Trade, or any particular Manufacture
<PB N="173" REF="205">
of any other Nation, at lea&s;t in the&s;e Parts
of the World.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Linen Manufacture is a
Thing &s;o univer&s;ally u&s;eful, &s;o wanted and
called for in all Parts, that if any Thing in
the World out-does our Wool, it is the
Flax, and this I might grant, without Pre|judice
I &s;ay to my general Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>FOR this is not a national Manufacture,
but a Manufacture of many Nations; and
I might almo&s;t &s;ay of all Nations, even
from <HI>Egypt</HI> in the <HI>Levant,</HI> where we
have Rea&s;on to believe it began, to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>
at the Bottom of the <HI>Baltick;</HI> whereas the
Woollen Manufacture, as now de&s;crib'd, is
a <HI>No&s;trum,</HI> a Peculiarity to <HI>England,</HI> and
to no other Country in the World, except
<HI>Ireland,</HI> which is our own.</P>
<P>THE Wool, as I have &s;aid, is an exclu|&s;ive
Grant from Heaven to <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
'tis peculiar to this Country, and no other
Nation has it, or any thing equal to it in
the World; and the Manufacture is of Con|&s;equence
&s;ingular to us al&s;o; nor do all the
Depredations made upon it by Imitation, by
Application for the getting Wool either
from us by Stealth, or from remote Coun|tries,
as <HI>Saxony, Sile&s;ia, Poland, Barbary,</HI>
and the like, amount to much; far from &s;o
much as <HI>England</HI> need be concerned at them;
while &s;he has the Wool, her Trade is invul|nerable,
at lea&s;t no mortal, final, de&s;tructive
<PB N="174" REF="206">
Blow can be given it; of which I &s;hall &s;ay
more in its Place.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the Callico and the Silk Ma|nufactures
in the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies</HI> are (at lea&s;t for
<HI>A&s;ia</HI>) an univer&s;al Manufacture; &s;o great,
that &s;preading into <HI>Europe,</HI> they become
a general Grievance, and are already pro|hibited
from being imported in &s;everal
Kingdoms and Countries in <HI>Europe,</HI> the
Quantity is &s;o great.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e again are the Manufactures of
many Nations, Kingdoms, nay Empires of
Nations, &s;uch as the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and
of the great <HI>Mogul,</HI> the Kingdoms of <HI>Gol|conda,</HI>
of <HI>Siam,</HI> of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> and many
more, too long to reckon up.</P>
<P>BUT the Woollen Manufacture, as above,
is &s;ingular to our Nation, no People in the
World can come up to us in the Workman|&s;hip,
or have the Materials; not that I am,
or will be partial to my Countrymen, as if
they were the Nonparels of the World for
manufacturing of Wool; 'tis evident, other
Nations would go a great Way with them
in it, if not outdo them, if they had the
Wool, the main Principle of the Manufa|cture
to work upon; but it cannot be, they
have it not, nor can have it, the whole World
cannot &s;upply it; they may get &s;ome Wool
in one Country, and &s;ome in another, and
too much they get clande&s;tinely from <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and much too much, from <HI>Ireland;</HI>
and with this the <HI>French</HI> make &s;ome Things
<PB N="175" REF="207">
very well, nor &s;hould I deny this Ju&s;tice to
that diligent Nation to own, that conside|ring
the Shifts they are put to for Wool, they
&s;hew them&s;elves but too good Manufactu|rers
in making &s;uch Things as they do.</P>
<P>BUT what does it amount to? they &s;upply
them&s;elves perhaps, and 'tis a great Step, if
they can do that; but it mu&s;t be remem|bred,
that it is becau&s;e their Government
obliges them to make Shift with it, and to
wear their own Works, however defective;
a Wi&s;dom we cannot arrive to, tho' we have
the Manufacture in its utmo&s;t Perfection:
<HI>Of which in its Order.</HI></P>
<P>BUT after all, they do not &s;upply them|&s;elves
neither, and in Spite of the &s;evere&s;t
Prohibition, in Spite of Tyranny, and the
Terror of an ab&s;olute Government, they do,
and will get <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures in, and
do import very great Quantities too, as I
could demon&s;trate by undeniable Evidences
of Fact.</P>
<P>WHAT el&s;e means the great and &s;udden
Export of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> more
ju&s;t after the Stop of the <HI>English</HI> Commerce
with <HI>France</HI> than ever before? what the
continued Export of the &s;ame Goods to
<HI>Dunkirk?</HI> and above all, what means the
Commerce between <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France</HI> by
the <HI>Maes</HI> and the <HI>Sambre,</HI> and by the <HI>Lys</HI>
and the <HI>Scheld.</HI></P>
<P>AND why? if the <HI>French</HI> make their Ma|nufactures
equal to others, I &s;ay, Why is it,
<PB N="176" REF="208">
that when the French Gentlemen make a
Tour over hither to &s;ee the Country, or
to vi&s;it the Court, they bring no more
Clothes with them, than tho&s;e on their
Backs, but make them more Clothes as &s;oon
as they come hither, and always carry &s;e|veral
Suits of Clothes Home with them?</P>
<P>ON the contrary, if an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman
goes Abroad into <HI>France</HI> to travel, he al|ways
makes him&s;elf new Clothes, and car|ries
them with him; I &s;peak now of the
Gentlemen of Quality that do not want
Clothes, or Money to buy them.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;on is plain, the <HI>Frenchman</HI> can
get none &s;o good at Home as he can buy
Abroad, and the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> can get none
&s;o good Abroad, as he can buy at Home.</P>
<P>IT is the like with the Linen and Lace in
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> if an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gen|tleman
travels into <HI>Flanders</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> he
carries as little Linen as po&s;&s;ible out with
him, but gets all he wants made there; and
when he comes back, he is &s;ure to make
him&s;elf two or three Dozen of fine Shirts,
and to lace them at the Neck and Hands
with fine Bone Lace.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, if a <HI>Dutch-man,</HI> or
<HI>French Gentleman</HI> comes over to <HI>England,</HI>
he is always well furni&s;h'd with Linen and
Lace before he comes.</P>
<P>THE Rea&s;ons are ju&s;t the rever&s;e of what
is &s;aid above; the <HI>Dutch-man</HI> or <HI>Fleming</HI>
can get none &s;o cheap Abroad as he can buy
<PB N="177" REF="209">
at Home, and the <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> can get none
&s;o cheap at Home, as he can buy Abroad.</P>
<P>I give this In&s;tance of the <HI>French,</HI> becau&s;e
they are the People who are &s;aid to have
made the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Advances in
the Woollen Manufacture; and much has
been &s;aid, and much fruitle&s;s Pains taken to
in&s;inuate, that the <HI>French</HI> make our Goods
to Perfection; nay, &s;ome will tell you, the
<HI>French</HI> out-do us, and under&s;ell us at Mar|ket;
which is a great Mi&s;take, and even in
the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade, which is the Top of their
Performance, and the Goods they &s;end thi|ther
are certainly the be&s;t of their Perfor|mance;
yet I appeal to the Men of Expe|rience
even in that Trade, whether they out|do
us; whether, as is mention'd in our fir&s;t
Chapter, a Bale of <HI>their Cloth</HI> will weigh as
much, or &s;ell for as much at Market, as a
Bale of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth? and whether in ge|neral,
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth is not rather bought,
tho' at a dearer Price, by the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and
<HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants, I mean tho&s;e who
are the chief Dealers in tho&s;e Goods, than a
Bale of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is true,</HI> there are in all Markets a &s;ort
of Buyers, who take up with the Goods of
an inferior Quality, for the Sake of a cheap
Price, and the&s;e will buy the <HI>French</HI> Cloths:
And the wor&s;t Goods will find a Chapman, as
well as the be&s;t, if the Price be accor|dingly.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="210">
IT is true al&s;o, the <HI>French</HI> Cloths carry
as good a Face as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> are as well
dre&s;t, as well pack'd and &s;et off, and the
Colours are as fine; &s;o that it is not hard to
deceive the unexperienc'd Buyer: And this
is not the only Example of the &s;uperficial
Performances of that Nation, who are very
rarely wanting in Out&s;ides, whatever they
are within; but the Sub&s;tance is wanting,
the real intrin&s;ick Worth of the Goods is
found in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloths, and in them only;
there is all the Beauty of Colour, and the
Ornament of Dre&s;s, and the Sub&s;tance too;
and this, whether the fir&s;t Buyer can di&s;co|ver
it or no, the la&s;t Buyer and Con&s;umer,
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gentleman, <HI>Aga</HI> or
<HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> that wears it, finds it out pre&s;ently;
one will wear firm and &s;mooth, and &s;olid to
the la&s;t; the other wears rough, light,
&s;pungy, and into Rags; and when this Man
buys again, he calls for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, he
will have no more <HI>French</HI> Cloth, for it did
him no Service, it did not wear well.</P>
<P>IF I did not &s;peak this from the Experi|ence
and per&s;onal Knowledge of tho&s;e that
have been upon the Spot, and been Wit|ne&s;&s;es
to the very Fact, I &s;hould not take
upon me to affirm it thus po&s;itively; but I
may appeal for the Truth of it to unan&s;we|rable
Evidence, nor is there Room to di&s;pute
it; the Nature of the Thing &s;peaks it, the
<HI>French</HI> Cloth, with all its &s;uperficial <HI>French</HI>
Glo&s;s upon it, is fine, but thin and &s;pungy,
<PB N="179" REF="211">
and will do the Wearer neither Credit or
Service, while the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth wears to
the la&s;t like a Board, firm and &s;trong, and
has a kind of Beauty even in its Rags.</P>
<P>HENCE I infer, we have no &s;uch Rea&s;on
to terrify our &s;elves with the Apprehen&s;ions
of other Nations ruining our Trade, and
out-doing us in our woollen Manufacture;
let us but keep our Wool at Home, and
we need be in no Pain for our Manufacture
any where: <HI>But of that hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>I return to the Magnitude of our Wool|len
Manufacture; which, as I have &s;aid
above, I in&s;i&s;t is the greate&s;t &s;ingle Manu|facture,
and occa&s;ions the greate&s;t Trade
both Abroad and at Home, of any Manufa|cture
that is to be found in any particular
Nation in the World, be that Nation other|wi&s;e
as much greater, richer, or more po|pulous
than we are, as you will.</P>
<P>BUT there is yet another thing to be con|&s;idered
in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufacture,
which is above all our Boa&s;ts; and were we
to u&s;e the utmo&s;t Partiality, and the utmo&s;t
Art to compliment our own Country, and
&s;et out the Beauty and U&s;efulne&s;s of our
Manufacture, nothing could be equal to this.</P>
<P>IT is not only great from the prodigious
Quantity of the Wool, the Numbers or the
People employ'd in it, the va&s;t Quantity
of Goods made, and the Beauty and Perfe|ction
of the Performance: But the Exten|&s;ivene&s;s
of its Con&s;umption, is another Pro|digy
<PB N="180" REF="212">
in Trade; and I cannot pa&s;s it with|out
&s;ome Notice: I'll be as brief as I can.</P>
<P>LINEN is a Thing univer&s;ally worn and
wanted; and few People of any tolerable
Figure or Fa&s;hion in the World are, or can
be without it: But then, more or le&s;s, all
the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> make it; and all they
have to do, is only as it were to exchange
Sorts with one another.</P>
<P>THE Silk Manufacture is very great, and
in all Nations &s;ome or other of it is made
u&s;e of, but then, 'tis made in many Coun|tries,
and is exported from one to another
in Trade &s;everal Ways, the <HI>French,</HI> the
<HI>Italians,</HI> the <HI>Venetians,</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the
<HI>Flemings,</HI> and now the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> make all
their own, and carefully exclude the <HI>Ea&s;t
Indian</HI> Silks from their Countries.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire are &s;up|ply'd
from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and
<HI>Africans</HI> South, and the <HI>Germans</HI> and
<HI>Swedes</HI> North, from <HI>India,</HI> the Variety
&s;preads as the Situation of the Countries,
and as the Commerce directs.</P>
<P>The Callicoes are &s;ent from the <HI>Indies</HI>
by Land into <HI>Turky,</HI> by Land and Inland
Seas into <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> and about
by long-Sea into <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> till
in general they are become a Grievance,
and almo&s;t all the <HI>European Nations</HI> but
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> re&s;train and prohibit them.</P>
<P>BUT take our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manu|facture,
and go where you will you find it;
<PB N="181" REF="213">
'tis in every Country, in every Market, in e|very
trading Place; and 'tis receiv'd, valued,
and made u&s;e of, nay, call'd for and wanted e|very
where. In a Word, all the World wears
it, all the World de&s;ires it, and all the World al|mo&s;t
envies us the Glory and Advantage of it.</P>
<P>NOR is it the Dre&s;s of the Mean and the
Poor in the &s;everal Countries where it
&s;preads, but of the Be&s;t and Riche&s;t: The
Princes, nay, at this Time I may &s;ay, the
Kings of the Earth, are cloth'd with it. I
appeal to all his Maje&s;ty's Servants, who
have had the Honour of his Commi&s;&s;ion as
Amba&s;&s;adors, and Re&s;idents in foreign Coun|tries,
and the Courts of Princes throughout
<HI>Europe,</HI> whether they have not &s;een the
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Sweden,
Denmark, Pru&s;&s;ia, Poland;</HI> nay, even the
Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> him&s;elf, cloathed in
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Spain</HI> vouch&s;afes, even on
his Days of Ceremony, to appear in a Bays
Cloak; the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> Lord of the
whole <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire, has His Robe of <HI>En|gli&s;h
Cloth,</HI> and the <HI>Sophy</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> amid&s;t
all his <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Silks, wears his
long Gown of Crim&s;on <HI>Broad Cloth,</HI> and
e&s;teems it, as it really is, the noble&s;t Dre&s;s
in the World.</P>
<P>As it is with the Princes, it is, and ever
will be with the People, the Nobility, the
Gentlemen, and in a Word, the Burghers,
the be&s;t and wealthie&s;t of the People are
<PB N="182" REF="214">
generally cloath'd with it; nay, &s;o far
has it prevail'd, that in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and other cold Climates, it has been known,
that tho&s;e who could not go to the Price of
<HI>Engli&s;h Cloth,</HI> have bought the Lifts of it
which the Taylors cut off, &s;owed them
together, and lin'd them with Furs, to make
them long Robes or Garments, which they
wore in that Country, till the late <HI>Czar</HI> cut
them &s;horter for them.</P>
<P>AND this brings me back to the Imitati|ons
which the People of the&s;e &s;everal Coun|tries
are &s;aid to run into, to the Prejudice of
our Manufacture. 'Tis true, the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ians,</HI> and &s;everal other People, do
imitate the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture, and would
gladly do it: univer&s;ally for the Advantage
of their People; and we cannot blame them;
nay, even this alone is a Document, an authen|tick
Voucher to the Truth of what I have
&s;aid: For if our Woollen Manufacture were
not nece&s;&s;ary to them, they would not buy
it of us; and if not profitable, they would
not attempt to mimick and make it.</P>
<P>BUT what does it all amount to? they are
able indeed to make the coar&s;e&s;t and meane&s;t
of the Manufacture, and that ju&s;t enough
to cover and cloath the Boors, and mo&s;t de|&s;picable
of their People; tho&s;e who&s;e Clo|thing
was our coar&s;e Duffells, Wadmill, Half
thicks, and in general a kind of the coar&s;e&s;t
Ker&s;ies, but a Degree or two above Blan|kets;
or perhaps, the meane&s;t of our Dozens,
<PB N="183" REF="215">
and what we call <HI>Yor&s;hire</HI> Cloths: And even
this is done but indifferently neither.</P>
<P>BUT in all the&s;e Countries, the People
of English &s;till cloath with our <HI>Fa&s;hion</HI> fine
broad Cloth; and 'tis ordinary to have a
Ship bound to <HI>Gottenburgh,</HI> or to <HI>Stock|holm,</HI>
carry 500 or 1000 <HI>Spani&s;h Cloths</HI> at
a Time into <HI>Sweden;</HI> by <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cloths I
mean the fine medly Cloths, &s;uch exactly
as we wear here, which are mix'd with
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool in the Making, and there|fore
call'd <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cloths.</P>
<P>IT is the &s;ame at <HI>Stetin</HI> and <HI>Koning&s;|burgh,
Strael&s;und</HI> or <HI>Dantzick,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding
the Kings of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI>
prohibiting our Cloths, and &s;etting their
own People to Work.</P>
<P>TO conclude; our Manufacture is the
general Wear, for therein the Argument is
forcible; 'tis not that &s;ome of it is to be had
everywhere, for &s;o might be &s;aid of &s;everal
other Things, as of the <HI>French</HI> fine Stuffs,
Silks and Druggets, and other light &s;pungy
Manufacture of Hair and Silk mingled with

<P>BUT the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> broad Cloth is the ge|neral
Wear; the Druggets, Serges, Du-roys,

to you, how well our Manufactures
are adapted to all Countries, Climates, Per|&s;ons,

<P>IN Value 'tis the &s;ame; not too cheap

for the Burghers and the Trade&s;men, no
not for the Boors, and the Pea&s;ants; not too

of Poor as rich; the highe&s;t Sovereign, and
the mo&s;t retir'd Reclu&s;e; 'tis the be&s;t Habit
of the be&s;t of their People, in every Nation

only Country where it is not &s;o, is that Part
of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which we call the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> where
the infinite Variety of their own Manu|factures,
and the little Time that the
<PB N="187" REF="219">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have traded among them, has not
yet made its Way; yet we find it begins to
be received in <HI>China,</HI> and al&s;o at the Court
of the <HI>Mogul;</HI> and as the Number of <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI>
encrea&s;e in the <HI>Indies,</HI> there is
Room to believe the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures
will gain Ground among them too; It is evi|dent,
that at <HI>Melinda,</HI> and the other <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI>
Settlements on the Ea&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>A|frica,</HI>
beyond the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI>
where the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have brought the
Natives to wear Clothes, even within five
Degrees of the Line; there the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ma|nufacture,

<P>WHAT can be more plain than the&s;e
Facts, of which the whole World are Wit|ne&s;&s;es?
And what can be a clearer Proof of
the Magnitude of our Woollen Manu|facture?
I think I need &s;ay no more a|bout
it.</P>
<P>WHAT Wonder then, that the &s;everal
Nations endeavour to &s;et their own People
to work to make it? How could any other
be expected? That al&s;o is a farther Te&s;timo|ny
of its intrin&s;ick Value, and the Nece&s;&s;i|ty
of it in U&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> IT appears, that they cannot be
without it.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> THAT it is to be had no where
el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="220">
1. THEY cannot be without it; if any
other Sort of Goods would &s;upply, if their
Linens would cloath the <HI>Germans,</HI> or their
Silks the <HI>Italians;</HI> if any Thing of their
own Growth would be equivalent to them,
why do they not prohibit ours, as they do the
Silks and Callicoes of <HI>India?</HI> I mean in
general, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> mo&s;t ridiculou&s;|ly
did a few Months &s;ince, without having
any thing for their People to wear in the
Room of them; which made their very Wo|men
laugh at them, and ask their Husbands
where they would get Cloths.</P>
<P>IT is true &s;ome Princes have prohibited
&s;ome of our Manufactures; that is to &s;ay,
&s;uch particular Sorts as their own Wool,
and their own People can make; but where
is the Prince or People, Kingdom or Em|pire
in the World, the <HI>Indies</HI> excepted,
who will, or indeed can be wholly without
our Woollen Manufacture?</P>
<P>2. THAT it is not to be &s;upplied from
any other Country, is as evident as the
other; for where is that Country, and why
are they not as rich, as opulent, as power|ful
at Sea, and on Shore, as <HI>England</HI> is?</P>
<P>WHERE is the Country? if there is not a
Country, as I have prov'd above, that has
or can have an equivalent Manufacture, or
that does not buy from us, How &s;hould
there be a Country that can &s;upply its
Neighbours?</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="221">
BUT why do not &s;ome of the Nations,
who envy the Profits and Advantages of
this Manufacture to us, and who would
be careful to keep at home the immen&s;e
Sums of Money, which this (to us happy)
Article draws from them; I &s;ay, Why do
they not publi&s;h a general Prohibition, not
of this or that particular Sort of our Goods,
but of all Woollen Goods what&s;oever, and
from what Country &s;oever?</P>
<P>IS it po&s;&s;ible, that they can find out
no Equipment for them&s;elves? Might not
the Men in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> cloath them|&s;elves
in thick Silks, Velvets, and &s;trong
<HI>Padua&s;oys?</HI> and in the North, might not
the <HI>Poles,</HI> the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the
<HI>Danes,</HI> the <HI>Pru&s;&s;ians,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> dre&s;s
them&s;elves in rich Furrs, Skins of Bea&s;ts,
&s;uch as the Sables and Ermines, Beaver, Ot|ter,
and black Fox Skins, the latter more
valuable than Ermines?</P>
<P>METHINKS the <HI>Germans,</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI>
who are &s;uch Ma&s;ters of the Linen and Silk
Manufactures, and have the Advantage of
&s;uch Quantities of Furrs as the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> could
furni&s;h them with, might improve them into
&s;ome Form, and turn them into &s;ome Shape,
&s;o as to &s;upply their Want of Clothes, and
not impoveri&s;h them&s;elves and their Coun|try
to buy Foreign Manufactures: The re|verend
grave Sables, and the royal Ornaments
of Ermines, might &s;erve to gratify their Va|nity,
and make them all, like tho&s;e Cor|poration-Princes,
<PB N="190" REF="222">
called Aldermen; and
they might cloath as rich in Furs and Fox-Skins
as they pleas'd, if the Out&s;ide was
plain, the In&s;ide would be great and rich,
and the Climate would reconcile them to
the Warmth of the Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis impo&s;&s;ible; it will not do; no|thing
can an&s;wer all the Ends of Dre&s;s, but
good <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> broad Cloth, fine Camlets,
Druggets, Serges, and &s;uch like; the&s;e they
mu&s;t have, and with the&s;e none but <HI>Eng|land</HI>
can &s;upply them; Be their Country
hot or cold, torrid or frigid, 'tis the &s;ame
Thing, near the Equinox, or near the Pole,
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufacture clothes
them all; here it covers them warm, from
the freezing Breath of the Northern <HI>Bear;</HI>
and there it &s;hades them, and keeps them
cool from the &s;corching Beams of a perpen|dicular

<P>LET no Man wonder, that the Woollen
Manufacture of <HI>England</HI> is arriv'd to &s;uch a
Magnitude, when in a Word it may be
&s;aid to cloath the World; there are but

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Magnitude of the Briti&s;h
Commerce, as it re&s;pects the Con|&s;umption
of foreign Goods import|ed
from abroad, as well as of our
own Product and Manufacture
at home.</HEAD>
<P>_AS our Manufactures, and other
Exportations are thus great, and
the Con&s;umption and Export of
our own, whether Product or
Manufactures, are &s;o much a Prodigy for
their Magnitude, and are thus extended to
all Parts of the World, our Importations
are no le&s;s prodigious; and this the rather,
becau&s;e of the great Con&s;umption of tho&s;e
Importations among our &s;elves, as well as
their Exportation as Merchandize.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that the Trade
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> by foreign Importations, is al&s;o
very great, and may be &s;aid to exceed the
Importations of <HI>England;</HI> and I believe in
many Articles they do &s;o, if we con&s;ider
their <HI>Ea&s;t Country</HI> Fleets, their <HI>Greenland</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="224">
Fleets, their <HI>Ea&s;t India,</HI> their <HI>French</HI> Wine,
and their Herring Fleets, and all their other
Branches of Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> and to the <HI>Me|diterranean;</HI>

of <HI>woollen Manufacture, Sugars, Tobac|cos,</HI>
wrought and other Plantation Goods;
<HI>Lead, Tin, Iron,</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;s; Drugs, Dye
Stuffs, Corn,</HI> &amp;c. from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then the <HI>Dutch</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood
to be as they really are, the <HI>Carryers of the
World,</HI> the middle Per&s;ons in Trade, the
Factors and Brokers of <HI>Europe:</HI> That,
as is &s;aid above, they <HI>buy</HI> to <HI>&s;ell</HI> again,
<HI>take</HI> in to <HI>&s;end</HI> out; and the greate&s;t Part
of their va&s;t Commerce con&s;i&s;ts in being
&s;upply'd from all Parts of the World, that
they may &s;upply all the World again:
Thus they &s;upply &s;ome Nations with Corn,
others with Ships, or Naval Stores for
Ships; others with Arms and Ammunition
of all kinds; &s;uch as Powder, Shot, Shells,
Lead, Iron, Copper, Cannon, Mortars,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> others with Fi&s;h, others with woollen
Manufactures, <HI>and the like;</HI> and yet, they
have neither Corn, Hemp, Tar, Timber,
Lead, Iron, Arms, Ammunition, woollen
Manufacture, or Fi&s;h of their own Growth;
the Product of their own Land or Seas,
or Labour of their own People, other than
as Navigators and Seamen, to fetch, find,
and carry them.</P>
<P>NOR is their home Con&s;umption of fo|reign
Importations great, except of Corn
<PB N="193" REF="225">
woollen Manufacture; their People are
few, compar'd to foreign Nations, tho'
many compar'd to the Country where they
dwell; their Way of Living is &s;paring, their
Exce&s;&s;es few and mean, and their O&s;tenta|tion
or Gayety very low priz'd.</P>
<P>BUT in <HI>England,</HI> the Country is large,
populous, rich, fruitful; the Way of Liv|ing,
large, luxurious, vain and expensive,
even to a Profu&s;ion, the Temper of the
People gay, oftentatious, vicious, and full
of Exce&s;&s;es; even criminally &s;o in &s;ome
Things, and too much encrea&s;ing in them
all.</P>
<P>HENCE comes as a Con&s;equence, a va&s;t
Importation of foreign Growth of every
kind, either for Eating or Drinking, for
Fancy or Fa&s;hions, and this &s;o great, as
not to be equall'd in any Part of the World;
the Fact &s;eems a Charge, tho' not de&s;ign'd
as &s;uch, but to illu&s;trate the Subject: But
I mu&s;t de&s;cend a little to Particulars, to
make it out.</P>
<P>I am credibly inform'd, and firmly be|lieve
it to be true, that take all the maritime
Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> where no Wine is
made, and ca&s;t them up together, they do
not import &s;o much Wine as the Subjects
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> do, for we have not a
Drop of our own Growth; and this, not|with&s;tanding
a very great Con&s;umption of
Malt-Liquors, Malt and Mela&s;&s;es Spirits,
Brew'd and di&s;till'd at Home; and notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="194" REF="226">
a va&s;t Quantity of Cyder and Per|ry,
Mead, Rum, and other Liquors; much
of it &s;pent in meer Extravagance and Profu|&s;ion;
and in &s;pite of a mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive Duty
upon the Importation of the Wine, as well
as an Exci&s;e upon the Con&s;umption of the
brew'd Liquors of our own.</P>
<P>THE Importation of Wines of all Kinds,
and Brandy included, from abroad, have
been often calculated by ju&s;t Mediums of
Years, and is lately ca&s;t up for the Year
1721, at 60000 Pipes, or 30000 Ton <HI>per
Annum.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then let me add by Way of Sup|plement,
That as I under&s;tand it,</P>
<P>1. ALL this Account is exclu&s;ive of the
Wines and Brandy imported in <HI>Scotland</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and the <HI>I&s;le of Man;</HI> and of all
the <HI>Madera</HI> and <HI>Canary</HI> Wines imported in
our Colonies, the <HI>Madera</HI> Wine being at
lea&s;t 1000 Ton <HI>per Annum;</HI> and the Wine
imported in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. can|not
be &s;o little as 3000 Ton more, which
makes it 40000 Ton in all.</P>
<P>2. IT is exclu&s;ive of all the <HI>French</HI>
Wines and Brandy run on Shore by the
Smugglers, in all the three Kingdoms,
and e&s;pecially in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI>
where I have &s;ome particular Rea&s;ons to
believe, not 1-6th Part (of the Brandy, e&s;|pecially)
pays the Duty.</P>
<P>3. IT is exclu&s;ive of all the Rum di&s;til|led
in the <HI>We&s;t India</HI> Colonies, and con|&s;um'd
<PB N="195" REF="227">
in tho&s;e Colonies, as well in the
lands, as on the Continent.</P>
<P>THESE are all to be call'd Importations,
and the Sum total is prodigious; let any
Man that may think me &s;evere, in &s;aying
we are a luxurious, expen&s;ive People, cal|culate
the annual Con&s;umption of Wine
and &s;trong Liquors in his Maje&s;ty's Domi|nions
at this Time; and then judge imparti|ally,
whether I do Ju&s;tice to the People
or no.</P>
<P>WERE Wine the ordinary Drink of the
People, or were &s;trong Beer and Ale the
needful Table-Liquors for the Support of
Life, it were quite another Ca&s;e; but if
Wine were the ordinary Drink, it would
be mingled in the drinking with Water,
as it is in the u&s;ual drinking of the Coun|tries
where it grows, as in <HI>Spain, Italy,
France,</HI> &amp;c. where &s;carce any Wine is
drank without Water, and very little to
Exce&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> IN <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Wine
mingled with Water, is the ordinary
Beverage or Drink for meer Nece&s;&s;ity,
as Food; but if they take any Thing
to exhilerate or rai&s;e the Spirits, it is
Brandy; which yet, they very rarely
drink to Exce&s;s; whereas here; all, as
well Brandy as Wine, and all our &s;trong
compounded Drinks, &s;uch as &s;tout Ale,
Punch, Double-Beer, Fine-Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are all drank to Exce&s;s, and that to
<PB N="196" REF="228">
&s;uch a Degree, as to become the Poi|&s;on,
as well of our Health as of our
Morals; fatal to the Body, to Prin|ciples,
and even to the Under&s;tanding;
and we &s;ee daily Examples of Men of
&s;trong Bodies drinking them&s;elves in|to
the Grave; and which is &s;till wor&s;e,
Men of &s;trong Heads, and good Judg|ment,
drinking them&s;elves into Idio|ti&s;m
and Stupidity: But that by the
way; I return to the Di&s;cour&s;e, as it
is the Subject of Trade; Wine, and all
the &s;trong Liquors mention'd above,
are not our Drink, but our Exce&s;s;
not our needful, but our &s;uperfluous
Drink.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, our <HI>Table Beer,</HI>
which is the whole&s;ome, u&s;eful, and nece&s;&s;a|ry
Liquor of the Country, made for Family-Supply,
and u&s;ed as &s;uch by the &s;ober Part
of our People, is excluded from the Ac|count:
Nor is there a Gallon of Water
mingled with a Hog&s;head of Wine, one
with another, for all the Wine we drink.</P>
<P>I am not going to launch out here into
a Satyr upon our Country, or to dip into
the Scandal of our common Vices; the im|men&s;e
Greatne&s;s of our Trade is the Sub|ject;
but our Vices are &s;o unhappily min|gled
with our Intere&s;t in Trade, that as a
late Author, writing on that Subject, &s;ays
well, <HI>Our Luxury is become a Virtue in
<PB N="197" REF="229">
Commerce,</HI> and our Extravagancies are the
Life and Soul of our Trade.</P>
<P>AS I propo&s;ed to judge of the Great|ne&s;s
of our Manufactures, by the Quantity
of the Wool which is con&s;um'd in ma|king
them; &s;o we may take &s;ome View of
the Con&s;umption of Liquor among us,
from the Quantity of Malt con&s;um'd in
<HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> that being the
Fund or Principle from whence they are
produc'd.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter here into a Cloud of
Figures, to deduce the long Account; but
tell you in the Gro&s;s, and at one View,
that calculating the Quantity of Drink
brew'd from the Quantity of Malt made,
and taking that from the Foot of the Ex|ci&s;e,
<HI>or Duty</HI> paid on the Malt, called in
general the <HI>Malt Tax,</HI> I venture to affirm,
there are forty Millions of Bu&s;hels of Malt
brew'd or di&s;till'd in his Maje&s;ty's Domi|nions
every Year, exclu&s;ive of what is ex|ported
in Trade to foreign Countries.</P>
<P>IT remains only to deduct out of this
Reckoning, the <HI>&s;mall Beer;</HI> that is to &s;ay,
the Quantity yearly made U&s;e of in Table
Beer for Family-U&s;es; and &s;hould I take
out one fourth Part for nece&s;&s;ary Beer, as
I call it; that is, &s;mall Table-Beer, which,
I think, is a great deal too much, there
would &s;till remain thirty Millions of Bu|&s;hels
to be brew'd in &s;trong Beer, which
it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is much of it Lux|ury
<PB N="198" REF="230">
and Extravagance, much of it Vice
and Intemperance.</P>
<P>REDUCE this again into Drink, and al|low
three Bu&s;hels of Malt to every Barrel
of &s;trong Beer; this makes no le&s;s than
ten Millions of Barrels of &s;trong Beer con|&s;um'd
at Home, in this &s;ober Nation in a
Year.</P>
<P>THE only Exception to this Account
that I can meet with, which has any
weight in it, is, that &s;ome of this Malt is
di&s;till'd into Spirits; and &s;uppo&s;e I allow
200000 Quarter <HI>per Annum,</HI> &s;o con&s;um'd,
that is, one Million, 600000 Bu&s;hel; it will
be an&s;wer'd, <HI>1&s;t,</HI> That this is of the wor&s;t
of the Malt, and of a Kind which would
not make good Beer, if it was brew'd, and
that much of it is not fit to be brew'd at
all: But then, <HI>2d,</HI> It will be &s;aid, that
this cannot be plac'd to the Account of
our Temperance, or taken off from the
Luxury &s;poken of, &s;ince 'tis generally
brew'd into a wor&s;e Liquor, and apply'd
to wor&s;e u&s;es, which it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s
at this Time to talk of, and which it would
be better, were it entirely forgotten (if that
could be) then &s;poken of at all.</P>
<P>IF this Con&s;umption of Liquors in the
King's Dominions were to be calculated
in the whole, and the Value were to be
ca&s;t up in Money, what an immen&s;e Sum
would it amount to? And what an Article
<PB N="199" REF="231">
would it make in the Magnitude of our
Trade?</P>
<P>1. TAKE the Wine and Brandy con&s;um'd
in the whole, and &s;uppo&s;e the Quantity
to be no more, than what is legally import|ed,
not reckoning the &s;o much greater
Quantity of what is clande&s;tinely run on
Shore by Smuggling, and other Frauds:
If the legally imported Quantity of Wine
and Brandy amounts to 40000 Ton, the
Rum con&s;um'd in the Plantations not in|cluded,
which is a very great Quantity.</P>
<P>LET this be brought to the Pint Pot;
that is, to the Retailer, and reduce it thus,
1. The Price of almo&s;t all Sorts of Wine
and Brandy, is at lea&s;t to a Con&s;umer, &s;old
at two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quart; the <HI>French</HI>
Wine, the Canary, the Rheni&s;h, the Sher|ry,
all at more than two Shillings; and the
Brandy by retail, generally at double the
Price: But take it one with another, at
two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quart, which is eight
Shillings <HI>per</HI> Gallon, and make a rea&s;ona|ble
Allowance for Bottoms and Leakage,
as u&s;ual; yet to what an immen&s;e Sum
does the Con&s;umption of imported Liquors
in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions amount to?</P>
<P>252 Gallons is a Ton, this at <HI>8s. per Gallon,</HI>
(the Retailers Price) amounts to 100 <HI>l. 16 s.
per</HI> Ton; but abating 12 Gallons in every
Ton for Bottoms and Leakage: And &s;uppo&s;e
it to be but 240 Gallons Nett Wine <HI>per</HI> Ton,
at 8 <HI>s. per</HI> Gallon, it is 96 <HI>l. per</HI> Ton.</P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THERE is no need at all of the
Abatement for Bottoms and Leakage,
the Vintners making effectual Pro|vi&s;ion
for it in their &s;hort Mea&s;ure;
and if that is not taken out, it a|mounts
to ju&s;t four Millions Sterling
<HI>per Annum;</HI> be&s;ides all the Wine and
Brandy really imported in the dark;
<HI>that is,</HI> by clande&s;tine Trade, Smug|gling,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THUS much is calculated upon the legal
Importation; and as we may call it, the
known, and avow'd Con&s;umption of Wines
and Brandy in the Dominions of <HI>Great
Britain;</HI> what we may &s;uppo&s;e to be clan|de&s;tinely
brought on Shore, is hard to
determine: But they who know as I do,
how common, how plentiful Brandy is, I
mean <HI>French</HI> Brandy, known and acknow|ledg'd
to be &s;uch on all the Sea Coa&s;ts of
<HI>England,</HI> in all Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
and how much it is us'd. They who'd
know, that but a few Years ago, 5000 Ton
<PB N="201" REF="233">
of Brandy was &s;aid to be brought into the
I&s;les of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> from <HI>France</HI> in
one Year. They who have had any Know|ledge
of the prodigious Quantity of Wine
and Brandy con&s;tantly brought to, and ma|nag'd
(&s;o it &s;eems 'tis call'd) in the <HI>I&s;le of
Man,</HI> for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, and by which
that whole I&s;land is vi&s;ibly enrich'd, to a
&s;urpri&s;ing Degree: I &s;ay, tho&s;e who have
had any In&s;ight in the&s;e Things, will not
think it unrea&s;onable to allow, at lea&s;t one
fourth Part more of Wine and Brandy to
this Account.</P>
<P>BUT it is enough to mention it only; I
believe, it will be readily admitted, that
what is &s;aid above, is very likely to be true,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions import
more Wine, than all the Countries of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
who are without Wine of their own
Import, put them all together.</P>
<P>IT may be true, that &s;ome of tho&s;e
Countries import more Brandy than we
do, in Proportion to their Trade; but it is
to be allow'd, only, becau&s;e we have load|ed
the foreign Brandy with heavy Duties,
in order to encourage the Con&s;umption of
our own Malt Spirits.</P>
<P>2. I might in the next Place calculate
here the Value, as I have already the Quan|tity
of our home Con&s;umption of &s;trong
Beer and Ale, among our own People;
and it would not be difficult to do it, ei|ther
from the Quantity of Malt con&s;um'd
<PB N="202" REF="234">
in the whole, (as well for Sale, as for pri|vate
U&s;e) as al&s;o from the Rate of Exci&s;e:
But the Sum would be &s;o great, it would
&s;urpri&s;e the Reader.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Beer, or Ale brew'd in
Gentlemens Hou&s;es for private U&s;e, does
not co&s;t &s;o much as the Beer brew'd for
Sale, becau&s;e of the Exci&s;e; but then, if we
&s;hould abate reckoning the Beer and Ale
retail'd, at the Price paid by the Con&s;umer,
which is the manner of Reckoning we are
now going upon, and is the true way, when
we are to examine the Magnitude of an
Expence, on the Foot of Trade; <HI>I &s;ay then,</HI>
if we &s;hould abate the retailing Price of the
Beer and Ale retail'd, in Ballance of the
Quantity con&s;um'd in private Families,
which I think is giving up a very manife&s;t
Odds; upon this Equality, we might bring
it to a Head, by rating all the &s;trong
Beer, and Ale con&s;ume'd in <HI>England,</HI> at the
Rate of twenty Shillings, upon every three
Bu&s;hels of Malt. If there are any Ob|jections
to be made again&s;t the Calculation,
I believe they would be ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd;
but if they cannot, they may be ballanc'd
by Abatement; for as by this Calculation,
the Con&s;umption of &s;trong Drink amounts
to no le&s;s than ten Millions Sterling <HI>per
Annum,</HI> if we &s;hould abate a quarter Part
of it; 'tis an immen&s;e and almo&s;t incredi|ble
Sum, and what no other Nation in the
World can expend in one &s;ingle Article.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="235">
Now to examine this a little another
Way, let any Man that is admitted to &s;uch
a Liberty, ca&s;t up the Books of the Exci&s;e,
and tell us how much the Exci&s;e upon
&s;trong Beer amounts to in <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from thence &s;ome E&s;timate
may be made.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE then, for Example, the Duty,
as collected; for in this Account, we are not
to ca&s;t up and deduct the Charges of the
Collection, the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Of|fice,
the Incidents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but how much is
collected from the Brewer; I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;e
this amounts in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and all his Maje&s;ty's Dominions,
where the Exci&s;e is payable, to 800000 <HI>l.
per Annum:</HI> I doubt not, but it amounts
to much more; but let the critical Enqui|rer
do Ju&s;tice on that Account, as he finds
the Ca&s;e will demand; I have good Grounds
to &s;ay it may be ca&s;t up thus, till a Rea|&s;on
is produc'd why it &s;hould not.</P>
<P>IF the Exci&s;e then, at four Shillings and
nine Pence <HI>per</HI> Barrel upon &s;trong Beer,
collects 800000 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> the Beer
being &s;old to the Retailer, at twenty Shil|lings
<HI>per</HI> Barrel, mu&s;t then amount to a|bove
four Times the Sum: We need not
in &s;uch a conjectural E&s;timate as this, ca&s;t
up the Fractions of three Pence <HI>per</HI> Bar|rel,
it would but add to the Sum, which
you may evidently &s;ee, I do not &s;eek to
make greater than it is.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="236">
THIS then brings the Value of the
Beer, as &s;old to the Retailer, to be three
Millions two hundred thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per
Annum.</HI></P>
<P>ADD to this then, the Value of the &s;trong
Beer brew'd for private Families, which,
as before, I take to be equal to the other,
(under the Di&s;advantage of its being under
rated, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Retailer, and not to the
Con&s;umer) but to avoid Cavils, I'll &s;tate
it at half that Sum: The Expence then of
&s;trong Beer in the&s;e Dominions, ri&s;es to
four Millions nine hundred thou&s;and Pounds
<HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>I could &s;upport the&s;e E&s;timates, by a
&s;tricter comparing the Quantity brew'd,
with the Quantity of Malt made; but 'tis
needle&s;s here, there is a manife&s;t Difference
between exact critical Examination, and a
general E&s;timate, after the manner of an
Hypothe&s;is; it is the latter that is before me
now; wherein, however, the Advantage is
&s;o great, that it fully an&s;wers the End of
the Argument, if I &s;hould throw in a Mil|lion
or two of Pounds Sterling, in the
whole, and take it at &s;o much le&s;s than it
really amounts to, as I am well <HI>a&s;&s;ur'd
I do in this Account: For Example,</HI> if ac|cording
to the propo&s;ed Principle, I am
ca&s;ting up the Value of the &s;trong Liquors
which the Nation con&s;umes, and ought to
take it (for the purpo&s;e) at the Rate it co&s;ts
the Con&s;umer, as I did in the Wine, it
<PB N="205" REF="237">
would &s;tand thus. Every Barrel of &s;trong
Beer retailed by the Victuallers, mea&s;ures
him out by the Quart Pot 36 Gallons; this
&s;old at <HI>3d. per</HI> Quart, the ordinary Price,
(tho' the general Rate is now 4 <HI>d.</HI>) is 36 <HI>s.</HI>
the Barrel, be&s;tides the Advantage of the &s;el|ling
much of it at 2 <HI>d. per</HI> Pint, and be&s;ides
the Half, which the Victualler finds in &s;hort
Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THIS is evident in the Suttlers
and others, who draw Drink in Garri|&s;ons;
and the Tap&s;ters, who take Cel|lars
and Tap-hou&s;es in great Inns, who
frequently allow the Governours and
Ma&s;ters of &s;uch Hou&s;es, 30 to 35 <HI>s.</HI> and
&s;ome 40 <HI>s. per</HI> Barrel for the Drink they
draw under them; &s;o that if I calcu|late
all the &s;trong Beer at the Rate of
but 20 <HI>s. per</HI> Barrel, it will allow for
all the Objections that can be made
again&s;t any other Part, &s;eeing it cannot
amount to much above half the Value
which the Con&s;umer pays.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole, I take upon me to &s;ay,
without any Hazard of being confuted, that
there is con&s;umed in his Maje&s;ty's Domini|ons,
of all the following Liquors, exclu&s;ive
of &s;mall Beer, no le&s;s, reckoning it at the
Value paid by the Con&s;umer to the Retailer,
and including the &s;trong Beer brew'd for
private U&s;e, than the full Value of eight
Millions <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>

<P>THE Plantations, as being Part of our
&s;elves, are always in Accounts of Trade, to
be ca&s;t up with our other Accounts; and as
their Produce is e&s;teem'd our own: So their
Con&s;umption &s;hould be al&s;o, and is &s;o in all
ju&s;t Calculations; and for this Rea&s;on, the
Importations from thence are not reckon'd
as foreign Importations, but as a Home
Produce.</P>
<P>THE next Article of the Importation of
foreign Goods is Linen, and this, it mu&s;t be
acknowledg'd, relates more e&s;pecially to
<HI>England,</HI> and to the Con&s;umption here, and
in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>OF this Con&s;umption, it may indeed be
&s;aid <HI>it is a Prodigy;</HI> and tho' there is a con|&s;iderable
Quantity of Linen made in &s;ome
Parts of <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially in the North
<PB N="207" REF="239">
Parts, as in <HI>Lanca&s;hire, Che&s;hire, York&s;hire,</HI>
and the four other Northern Countries, in|&s;omuch,
that at one Market in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI>
'tis &s;aid, there is the Value of 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Week
&s;old in Hukabacks only; yet this Quantity is
&s;o little worth mention, that this &s;ort of Li|nen
is &s;carce &s;een at <HI>London;</HI> but <HI>England</HI>
does as it were ravage the whole &s;pinning
World for Linen and Linen Yarn and Lace,
which is Linen al&s;o.</P>
<P>THE principal Importations of Linen are
indeed from our neighbouring Countries;
but &s;uch is the exceeding Con&s;umption of
Linen here, that it &s;eems as if all the World
were not able to &s;upply us; and this not
only of the coar&s;er Kinds of Linen from the
Northern Nations, but &s;uch is the Demand
of fine Linens, <HI>Hollands, Cambricks,</HI> and
the fine&s;t of other Country Linen, that it is
advanc'd to me for a certain Truth, by a
Per&s;on experienc'd in tho&s;e Trades, that
<HI>England</HI> alone wears and con&s;umes as much
fine Linen; nay, his Words are, <HI>More of
the fine&s;t Linen</HI> than all the Kingdom of
<HI>France,</HI> the <HI>Au&s;trian Netherlands,</HI> and the
<HI>united Provinces</HI> put together, where the
fine Linen is chiefly made.</P>
<P>I need not enter critically into the Enqui-whether
this is literally true or no; but
when I come to look into our Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e
Entries, and &s;ee by the Books the exceeding
Quantity of Linen, as well fine as coar&s;e,
<PB N="208" REF="240">
imported into <HI>England</HI> from all Parts, it is
really &s;urpri&s;ing. <HI>For Example,</HI></P>

great, not le&s;s than 100 Ships Load|ings

<P>A$$ the&s;e, be&s;ides <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots Linen,</HI>
the Quantity of which, e&s;pecially &s;ince the
Encouragement given to their Importation,
by the printing of Linen, is &s;o much, that
the Importation of <HI>Iri&s;h Linen,</HI> amounts to
at lea&s;t 2000000 Yards in a Year, and is
&s;till exceedingly encrea&s;ing; being &s;o in
Demand, that if the Ships are but a little
Wind bound, there is frequently not a Yard
of <HI>Iri&s;h Linen</HI> to be had in the Town.</P>
<P>LET any one judge, whether we do no$
as it were ravage the World for Linen, and
whether I have exceeded in &s;aying, we im|port
more Linen than any one Nation in the
World.</P>
<P>IT is true, that a very great Quantity of
Linen of all Kinds is &s;hip'd off again from
<PB N="210" REF="242">
hence. But it is an&s;wered, That it is chiefly,
if not wholly to our own Colonies in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>
which, as I &s;aid above, is ju&s;tly to be
e&s;teemed our own Con&s;umption, as being
all con&s;umed by our own People.</P>
<P>IT is indeed impo&s;&s;ible to make an E&s;ti|mate
of the Quantity of Linen imported
from all the&s;e places into <HI>Great Britain</HI> and
<HI>Ireland:</HI> For notwith&s;tanding the Quanti|ties
made either in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI>
there are yet great Quantities of fine Hol|lands,
Cambricks, and other Sorts imported
in both tho&s;e Countries. I &s;ay, there can
be no E&s;timate made of the Value. But
having thus de&s;crib'd the Trade in its &s;eve|ral
Branches, I leave it under this General,
namely, that there is more Linen as well in
Bulk as in Value imported from other Coun|tries,
into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions, than any,
or than all the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> put to|gether
import be&s;ides us.</P>
<P>I could $$n over all the Kingdoms and Pro|vinces
of <HI>Europe</HI> by Name, and from their par|ticular
Circum&s;tances give Rea&s;ons to prove
this. It is certain, that thro' all the <HI>German</HI>
Empire, <HI>Italy, France, Flanders, Holland,</HI>
all tho&s;e Kingdoms and Provinces, either
make their own Linen, &s;ome &s;mall Quanti|ty
of particular Sorts excepted, or make
more than they u&s;e, and &s;end it abroad.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o certain, that tho&s;e Countries
where the Linen they make is of an inferior
Quality, as in <HI>Poland, Ru&s;&s;ia, Pru&s;&s;ia,
<PB N="211" REF="243">
Pomerania,</HI> &amp;c. Either they u&s;e a very
little Quantity of <HI>Linen,</HI> compar'd to what
is made U&s;e of in <HI>England,</HI> or make Shift
with the meaner Quality and Kinds, which
their own Countries produce; and except
the Courts and Princes in tho&s;e Countries,
they call for very little from abroad.</P>
<P>FOR Proof of this, we are able to give a
known Example of all the Northern Parts
of the Empire in Particular; where 'tis evi|dent,
tho' they buy neither from <HI>Holland,
France,</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI> they are in no Want;
but the Gentry, and even the Princes and
Nobility are &s;upplied with fine Linen, at
lea&s;t the fine&s;t that they u&s;e from their own
Manufacture; that is to &s;ay, from <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI>
and the Provinces of <HI>Lu&s;atia, Bohemia,
Moravia,</HI> and the Countries adjoining;
&s;o that all that Part of the World may be
&s;aid to make Linen even more than &s;uffici|ent
to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>NOR can we de&s;ire a better Evidence of
this, than is to be found in the two follow|ing
Articles,</P>
<P>1. THAT as I &s;aid above, we import into
<HI>England</HI> a great deal of fine Linen from
tho&s;e Countries, &s;uch as fine <HI>Lawns,</HI> equal
to ome of the Cambricks which are made
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> al&s;o fine Diapers and Damasks;
and it cannot be doubted, but tho&s;e Provin|ces
which &s;upply tho&s;e Sorts to us at &s;uch
a Di&s;tance, are able to &s;upply them&s;elves;
for I call all the <HI>German</HI> Provinces on that
<PB N="212" REF="244">
Side, <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> being all the Dominions
of the &s;ame Sovereign, &s;peaking the &s;ame
Language, and lying contiguous to one
another.</P>
<P>2. THE <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves, who make
tho&s;e fine HOLLANDS which we import
here, and which we give &s;uch a Price for,
buy the fine&s;t of the Yarn, with which tho&s;e
Hollands are made, from tho&s;e very Pro|vinces;
and it cannot be que&s;tion'd, but
that the <HI>Sile&s;ians,</HI> who &s;upply the <HI>Dutch</HI>
with &s;uch fine Yarn, are able to &s;upply them|&s;elves,
and the Provinces about them, with
all the fine&s;t Sorts of Linen they have Oc|ca&s;ion
to buy.</P>
<P>THIS Example is &s;ufficient, and for this
Rea&s;on I bring it; to prove that all the&s;e
northern Countries &s;upply them&s;elves with
Linen &s;ufficient for their own U&s;es; no Na|tion
but <HI>Britain,</HI> nay, but <HI>England,</HI> buys
and imports the Gro&s;s of their Linen from
Abroad; and yet at the &s;ame Time, no
People in <HI>Europe</HI> wear and con&s;ume &s;o
great a Quantity of Linen, and that Quan|tity
&s;o fine in its Quality, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
do.</P>
<P>IT is true, that <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> im|port
great Quantities of Linen, having
very little of their own; but 'tis not worth
Mention, in Compari&s;on with <HI>England;</HI>
nor do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> wear any Proporti|on
in <HI>Quantity</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> as may be
determined from the Certainty and Same|ne&s;s
<PB N="213" REF="245">
of their Dre&s;s: So I need &s;ay no more
to that Part.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Italy</HI> in all its Parts, from <HI>Na|ples</HI>
to <HI>Turin, Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> they
not only do not u&s;e &s;o much in Proporti|on
as the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but what they do make,
they (e&s;pecially the <HI>Venetians</HI>) make in
their own Countries.</P>
<P>INDEED it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> who for &s;o many Ages were
famous for making the fine&s;t Lace, and
con&s;equently mu&s;t have a &s;ufficient Quan|tity
of the fine&s;t Thread, could want a Ma|nufacture
of the fine&s;t Linen; and it is
known, that they do not want it, but on
the contrary, export it to the I&s;lands in
the <HI>Archipelague,</HI> and other Parts among
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who have much Cotton, but
little or no Flax.</P>
<P>THUS I think I may have accounted for
all the Linen-wearing World; that every
where but in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> they wear
le&s;s Linen, or make more than in <HI>England;</HI>
and in mo&s;t of tho&s;e Countries, make &s;uffi|cient

&s;ome Exceptions to this general Head, <HI>that
is to &s;ay,</HI> that in <HI>Sweden, Norway</HI> and

as the City of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> does to <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
but the Objection is not worth the

<PB N="214" REF="246">
not &s;ay no other Nation imports any Li|nen,
or u&s;e any, but what they make of
their own; but I do &s;ay and in&s;i&s;t on it,
that all tho&s;e Nations put together, do not
import the Quantity that <HI>England</HI> and the
other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions do import.</P>
<P>I have quitted this Article, without men|tioning
al&s;o, that be&s;ides the Quantity of
Linen we con&s;ume, which as above, is be|yond
all Calculation, we import from <HI>Hol|land,
Hamburgh,</HI> and e&s;pecially of late
from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> very great Quantities of Linen-Yarn,
for our own People to manufacture,

<P>NOR is this Importation &s;mall and in|con&s;iderable,
tho' in Compari&s;on of the Li|nen
it is &s;o indeed; but all join together,

THEY that at fir&s;t Sight look upon this

<P>BUT let them go thro' all the Articles,

ob&s;erve, which bring them to our pre&s;ent

<P>1. THAT they are really &s;o far from be|ing

<P>2. THAT no Nation in <HI>Europe</HI> imports

le&s;s of all of them together, as we do.</P>
<P>THEY are a wonderful Te&s;timony of the
Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce, in

of the Value, the Coffee, Tea, and
Chocolate only, are equal in Trade, to the
Spices of the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>IT is worth Notice al&s;o, what Num|bers
of &s;tout Ships the&s;e particular Ar|ticles,
tho' &s;mall in them&s;elves, con&s;tantly
employ; for be&s;ides the Pipiners, as they

are very great Articles in the Freight
of Ships, and encourage and &s;upport the
Navigation in its mo&s;t con&s;iderable Parts.</P>
<P>IT would be &s;urpri&s;ing, if the Con&s;ump|tion
of tho&s;e few Articles once thought &s;o
trifling, and formerly &s;o entirely unknown,
were ca&s;t up into Money, and their Value
brought together, what Sums they would
amount to: To ca&s;t up the Tea, Coffee,

Cargoes of the Ea&s;t <HI>India</HI> Ships 500000 <HI>l.</HI>
Weight of Tea in one Ship, &s;ix or &s;even
hundred thou&s;and Pound Weight, when
two Ships come in together? We cannot
&s;uppo&s;e this &s;old cheaper than from 10 to 16 <HI>s.
per</HI> Pound to the Retailer; 300 to 400 Tun
of Coffee comes frequently Home in one

not much of it con&s;um'd in <HI>England;</HI> but
the Quantity is great, and the Chocolate

<P>THE Importation of Silk is an Article of

To make an E&s;timate of the Value, or
of the Con&s;umption of all the&s;e Things,
would be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to enquire into
the Number of our Shipping, of Ships
built yearly, (and which is &s;till more as to
the Con&s;umption) Ships repairing and fit|ting
out; an Article, when join'd together,
too great to make any Calculation upon.</P>
<P>I might mention here, how unaccountably
to blame we are in this Trade; that where|as
a full Supply might be had of all tho&s;e
things, <HI>I may &s;ay, Every one of them</HI> from
our own Colonies, the Product of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h
proper Dominions,</HI> the Labour of the
<HI>Briti&s;h</HI> People, and which is equal to it, all
brought by our own Ships, to the va&s;t En|crea&s;e
of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Navigation, it &s;hould
mi&s;erably be neglected or omitted, and the
Goods be bought with our ready Money,
great Part of them brought Home in
foreign Bottoms, and the whole Trade ma|naged
in a wrong Place; or, as we may &s;ay,
running in a wrong Channel, to the infi|nite
Advantage of the <HI>Danes, Swedes,
Poles, Pru&s;&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and to
the enriching the (otherwi&s;e) poore&s;t and
mo&s;t worthle&s;s, and I had almo&s;t &s;aid, the
mo&s;t beggarly Nations in the World. But
I &s;hall &s;peak farther of this by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>I have not in all this Account mentioned
any thing of our Importations from <HI>Holland,</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="256">
except only that Particular of the Spice
Trade, and Linens, which I call their own.</P>
<P>BUT this is not, that our Importations
from thence are not exceeding great, only
that we do not import any thing material
or con&s;iderable from thence, that is of their
own Growth or Manufacture; but that by
importing from them, we only bring in the
Goods of almo&s;t all Countries in the World
thro' their Hands: So that, tho' we are &s;aid
to &s;ell them the Value of two Millions <HI>per
Annum</HI> in our own Manufacture; yet 'tis
certain, we take off again a prodigious
Quantity of Goods of other Nations thro'
their Hands; &s;o that 'tis hard to deter|mine
which Way the Balance turns, ei|ther
for us, or again&s;t us, and I make no
Difficulty in affirming, that it may be &s;ome|times
one Way, &s;ometimes another.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY, &s;uppo&s;e a dear Year of
Corn in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o that the Exportation
comes to be prohibited. This putting a Stop
at once to &s;o con&s;iderable a Branch of our
Exports to <HI>Holland,</HI> would go a great Way
in &s;hortning our Credit, in the general Ac|count
of Trade with the <HI>Dutch for that
Year,</HI> and con&s;equently might give a turn
to the Balance; we at the &s;ame Time not
abating our Demand of foreign Goods from
them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, &s;uppo&s;e for a further Example,
a Scarcity of Sugars and Tobacco in the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h
Colonies</HI> for the &s;ame Year; for at the
<PB N="225" REF="257">
Time that a common Sterility, or failing of
the Crop of Corn &s;hould happen in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
the Crop of Sugars might (<HI>as it often
does</HI>) fail in <HI>Barbadoes, Jamaica,</HI> and the
other I&s;lands and Colonies of <HI>America,</HI> and
the Crop of Tobacco al&s;o in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>ADD to this, that in &s;uch a Year, it being
probable the di&s;tilling of Corn might be
forbidden in <HI>England,</HI> as no doubt it would
for &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; the Con&s;equence of
which would be the allowing a greater Im|portation
of Brandy from <HI>Holland,</HI> which
they would pour in upon us, infinitely to
their Advantage, we being plea&s;ed at this
Time to allow the bringing in <HI>Brandy</HI>
by way of <HI>Holland,</HI> at the &s;ame Time
loading it with an in&s;upportable Duty,
if directly brought from other Places, tho'
we might perhaps put all the Gain which
the <HI>Dutch</HI> make now of it, into our own
Pockets.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e, and many other Ca&s;es, it is
ea&s;ie to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Ballance of Trade
may, and &s;ometimes does turn again&s;t <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
by our general Commerce with the
<HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>NOR can it be doubted, but that even at
this Time, tho' the Exportation of Corn,
and of Sugars, and Tobacco, has no In|terruption;
yet the late Encrea&s;e of the Im|portations
from <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;uch as fine Hol|lands
and Linen of all Sorts, and admitting
Brandy from thence, as above, has infi|nitely
<PB N="226" REF="258">
encrea&s;ed the Debt of Trade on our
Side, and at lea&s;t turn'd the Ballance very
much in favour of the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>THE Sum of all the&s;e Explanations, and
more, which might be mentioned, may
be drawn up into the&s;e Heads.</P>
<P>1. THAT the Magnitude of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Exportations, as they con&s;i&s;t only of our
own Growth and Manufacture (including
that of our Colonies as our own) is grea|ter
than that of any other &s;ingle Nation in
the World.</P>
<P>2. THAT the Con&s;umption in <HI>England</HI>
of foreign Importations, and of the improv'd
Product of our own Country; that is to
&s;ay, our Woollen and other Manufactures, is
likewi&s;e infinitely greater than the Home
Con&s;umption of any other Nation.</P>
<P>FROM both which Articles, as they have
been explain'd in the la&s;t two Chapters, I
think I have &s;uffciently made out what I
&s;aid in my Title, of the Magnitude of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce, and that it is a Prodigy
of its Kind, the like of which is not to be
&s;een any where in <HI>Europe,</HI> if it may be in
any Part of the World.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome other Heads of Trade
nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;poken to, in order to make
this Work a compleat Plan of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Commerce.</P>
<P>1. WITH Relation to <HI>Home Trade,</HI> I
&s;hould make &s;ome E&s;timates of the natu|ral
<PB N="227" REF="259">

<ITEM>The Mines,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Minerals,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Timber,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Stone.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>HERE I &s;hould de&s;cribe the Manner of
breeding and managing our Cattle, the prodi|gious
Con&s;umption, e&s;pecially of their Fle&s;h,
and the Employment of them; that is, of
Oxen and Hor&s;es in Labour for the car|rying
on of Trade.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> ALSO I might a&s;&s;ert, and (fully
prove my A&s;&s;ertion by unan&s;werable
Rea&s;ons) that notwith&s;tanding in gene|ral,
it is the Advantage of Commerce,
to have all Things done as cheap as
po&s;&s;ible; yet that <HI>as</HI> it is the grand Sup|port
of Wealth and Trade in <HI>England,</HI>
to have our Product con&s;um'd, and in
order to it, to have our People and
Cattle employ'd; So, it is not always
the Advantage of <HI>England,</HI> to le&s;&s;en the
Labour of the &s;aid People and Cattle,
by the Encrea&s;e of River-Navigation;
and &s;ome Examples which might con|firm
this might be brought, which
amount to a Demon&s;tration.</P>

great, but as &s;o great a Quantity of
the Materials are of our own Growth

own Manufacture, whereas the Ship|ping
in <HI>Holland</HI> has hardly any Thing
belonging to it produced at Home,

the Ships.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Magnitude of our Trade,
as it relates to our other Exporta|tions,
and particularly what we
call Re-exportation, or Exporting
by Certificate; including the Ex|ports
of Goods fir&s;t imported from
our own Colonies, and Factories
Abroad.</HEAD>
<P>_ THO' all I have &s;aid of the Great|ne&s;s
of our woollen Manufacture
is prov'd, and how great &s;oever the
Con&s;umption of it is in the World,
I would not be under&s;tood to mean, that
this was the whole of our Commerce, ei|ther
one Way or other: On the contrary,
this is but one Branch of it: It is true, it
<PB N="231" REF="263">
is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Branch; that I mu&s;t
always grant, and is indeed the Wheel
within the Wheel of all the re&s;t; That which
&s;ets all the Wheels of Trade in Motion;
I mean of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade; 'tis the Life
of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT we have &s;everal Branches of Com|merce,
very con&s;iderable be&s;ides this, and
that for Exportation too: <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>THE Exportation of Corn, Salt, Fi&s;h,
and Fle&s;h, I put the&s;e four Articles toge|ther,
for Rea&s;ons which we &s;hall &s;ee in the
Cour&s;e of this Work; they are all very
great Heads of Trade and Employ in <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> a great Number of our Ships,
more perhaps than will be thought proba|ble
at fir&s;t Sight.</P>
<P>THIS Article, indeed, includes <HI>Ireland,</HI>
of which I have yet &s;aid nothing; tho' as
we are one Government, the Trade of
the whole ought to come under one Head
of Commerce: However, I &s;hall not med|dle
with the Trade of <HI>Ireland</HI> here, any
farther than as it is blended with the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI>
Commerce, and carried on together,
as in this Article it is, and is in&s;eparable
from it.</P>
<P>CORN is chiefly exported from <HI>England</HI>
to <HI>Holland;</HI> tho' <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which may
truly be call'd a Corn Country, is always
ready to &s;end it, wherever they can find a
Market; &s;o that wherever the Harve&s;t hap|pens
to fail abroad, whether in <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="264">
Spain, <HI>Portugal,</HI> or even in <HI>Italy</HI> it &s;elf,
we are always at Hand to &s;upply them; it
being very rare that <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI>
has a general Scarcity, &s;o as to &s;top the
Exportation.</P>
<P>As it is certainly true, that whatever
Corn can be &s;pared for Exportation out of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> above what is nece&s;&s;ary for
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting our own People, is clear Gain to
the publick Wealth of the Nation: So this
Article of exporting Corn, is one of the
mo&s;t advantageous Parts of our Commerce,
in Proportion to its Magnitude.</P>
<P>NOR is the Dearne&s;s of the Price of
Corn at Home, any real Detriment to the
Generality, or any Abatement of the pub|lick
Stock, provided we admit none from
Abroad; for tho' it may be a Damage to
&s;ome particular Per&s;ons, and may pinch the
Poor, who yet, for ought I &s;ee, are always
alike poor, in Plenty, as in Scarcity; of
which hereafter; yet, I &s;ay, 'tis no lo&s;s to
the publick Stock, becau&s;e it is all paid a|mong
our &s;elves; The general Body of
the People have but one publick Stock of
Wealth, whereof every individual is tru&s;t|ed
with a Part; and what they pay to, or
get from one another, no way le&s;&s;ens or
encrea&s;es that Stock, only le&s;&s;ens and en|crea&s;es
the particular Part, which this or
that particular Per&s;on was &s;o entru&s;ted
with; as if ten Men, having each a hun|dred
Guineas in their Pockets, go together
<PB N="233" REF="265">
into a Room or Hou&s;e to play; 1&s;t, take the
Room in which they play, to contain a
publick Stock of the whole thou&s;and Gui|neas;
&s;uppo&s;e then, after &s;ome Time of
play, one or two of the ten win all the
Money, and break the re&s;t: There are
eight Men left empty and poor, and two
Men grown full and rich; but the Money
is all in the Room &s;till, the thou&s;and Guineas
are not dimini&s;h'd at all, the Stock they
play'd with is neither le&s;&s;en'd or encreas'd.</P>
<P>THIS is too plain to dwell upon: It
is the &s;ame Thing in the Ri&s;e and Fall of
the Rate of Corn con&s;um'd at Home.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, if Corn bears a
great Price in <HI>Portugal</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> or any
where Abroad, all that Advance of Price,
except only the Labour of the People in
carrying it, is clear Gain; and even all their
Labour too, except the Provi&s;ions which
they con&s;um'd in the Voyage, is &s;o much
added to the publick Stock.</P>
<P>I am a profe&s;s'd Oppo&s;er of all fortuitous
Calculations, making E&s;timates by gue&s;s
Work, of the Quantities and Value of any
Trade or Exportation, where, as I &s;aid
before, there is no given Number or Rule
to rai&s;e tho&s;e E&s;timates upon; and as this is
one of the Ca&s;es, in which there is no Cer|tainty
to calculate from, and e&s;pecially ha|ving
not the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Books to re|fer
to, I therefore decline it.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="266">
AND yet, I would not have been without
&s;ome probable Grounds of Calculation from
the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Books, if I had not
found that there is no judging of the Ex|portation
of one Year, from the Quantities
exported in another, for the Rea&s;ons fol|lowing.</P>
<P>1. BECAUSE our Exportation of Corn
depends upon the Crop we have had the
Harve&s;t before, and by Con&s;equence on the
Price the Corn bears at Market, whether
dear or cheap, according to which the Mer|chant
is limited from, or encourag'd to the
Exportation.</P>
<P>2. BECAUSE likewi&s;e, tho' the utmo&s;t
Encouragement was given at Home for the
Exportation, the Quantity exported will
depend al&s;o upon the Plenty or Scarcity of
Corn Abroad. It is true, that dear or
cheap, Corn always finds a Market in <HI>Hol|land:</HI>
But then, 'tis as true, that if the
<HI>Dutch</HI> find a forc'd Exportation, they, like
all expert Merchants, will buy cheap, and
perhaps to lo&s;s, or not buy at all: So that in
&s;hort, it is no Market at all: To &s;ell to
Lo&s;s, is not to be call'd Trade, but a
Stop or Check to Trade; for the Seller find|ing
no Profit, is &s;ure to come there no
more, till he is &s;atisfied by his Intelligence
of a better Market.</P>
<P>THE Quantity exported therefore de|pending
upon &s;uch precarious Circum&s;tan|ces,
it would be of no Importance to make
<PB N="235" REF="267">
Calculations upon Uncertainties, that is
to &s;ay, upon &s;uch evident Uncertainties;
There may be 500000 Quarters of Corn
exported in one Year, and not one Bu&s;hel
the next; as was the Ca&s;e among our &s;elves
but a few Years ago, when there was not
le&s;s than a Thou&s;and Quarters of Wheat a
Day entred at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e in <HI>London</HI>
for a great while together, to be exported
to <HI>Ireland,</HI> be&s;ides an immen&s;e Quantity
&s;hipt off on all the We&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI>
from <HI>Che&s;ter Water</HI> as far North as the
<HI>Clyde</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> A great Scarcity hap|pening
that Year in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be laying a prepo&s;terous Foun|dation
to calculate from hence what might
be yearly exported that Way, when per|haps
for twenty Years before, <HI>Ireland,</HI>
which generally is more able to &s;pare
Corn, than likely to want it, had not called
for a Quarter of Corn, and perhaps may
not again, for twenty Years to come.</P>
<P>IT may be the like in <HI>France,</HI> and of|ten
is, that in one Year they &s;hall take two
or three Hundred Thou&s;and Quarters of
Corn from <HI>England,</HI> if they can get it;
and the next Year or two would give no|thing
for it (&s;peaking comparatively) if you
would carry it them.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I &s;ay there is no Cal|culation
to be made of the Quantity of
Corn exported; only that in general it is
always very great, (<HI>except as before.</HI>)</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="268">
THE Ea&s;t and South Coa&s;t of <HI>Britain</HI> is
chiefly concerned in this Trade from the
<HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to the Mouth of
the <HI>Thames;</HI> more e&s;pecially the Ports of
the <HI>Humber,</HI> the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> from
<HI>Lyn</HI> to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Suffolk</HI> al&s;o, from <HI>Yarmouth</HI> exclu&s;ive, to
<HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> inclu&s;ive.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> THE Fi&s;h; there is &s;omething more
of Certainty in our Calculations of the
Exportation of Fi&s;h, than of mo&s;t other
Goods; particularly of the Herring, Pil|chards,
and white Fi&s;h, and to take this by
the Merchants Calculations, rather than by
that of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, becau&s;e the
former can give an E&s;timate where the
latter cannot, I mean Abroad. To begin
North,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scots</HI> are &s;aid to cure &s;ixty Thou|&s;and
Barrels of Herrings for Exportation,
one Year with another, including the We&s;t
of <HI>Scotland</HI> as well as the Ea&s;t Side; I think
they that calculated the <HI>Scots</HI> Herring-fi&s;h|ing
at &s;ixty Thou&s;and La&s;t, which is ten
Times the Quantity, had no Gue&s;s with
them, but &s;poke by Way of Blu&s;ter, (tho'
in Print) it being more than the <HI>Dutch</HI>
take one Year with another; at lea&s;t in
their fir&s;t Part of the Fi&s;hery: Sixty thou|&s;and
Barrels is a large Quantity.</P>
<P>THE next Part of the Herring-fi&s;hing on
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t is at <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> for the
red Herring Trade; the Towns of <HI>Yar|mouth</HI>
<PB N="237" REF="269">
and <HI>Leo&s;toff</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed, if they
have a good Fair, as they call it; that is
a good fi&s;hing Sea&s;on, to cure four Thou|&s;and
La&s;t of Herrings, that is, forty Thou|&s;and
Barrels a Year, the greate&s;t Part of
which is exported to <HI>Holland, France, Spain</HI>
and <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>NEXT to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> the Fi&s;hing for Her|rings
for the <HI>London</HI> Market comes in, and
for pre&s;ent Con&s;umption, and this is a con|&s;iderable
Article; but being all for Home
Bu&s;ine&s;s, it weighs nothing in the Scale of
our foreign Commerce: The&s;e Fie&s;e are or|dinarily
taken in the Mouth of the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>IN the We&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> on the Coa&s;ts
of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> and <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and &s;ometimes
of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> the <HI>Pilchards</HI> are a particular
Fi&s;hery, &s;ingular to that Coa&s;t, and found no
where el&s;e in tho&s;e Seas, or in this Part of
the World; it is computed, that the u&s;ual
Quantity of <HI>Pilchards</HI> cur'd in tho&s;e Seas
in a Year, are from a Thou&s;and to twelve
Hundred La&s;t.</P>
<P>ADD to the&s;e the Herring-fi&s;hing in the
<HI>Bri&s;tol Channel,</HI> about <HI>Bidiford, Barn|&s;taple,</HI>
and tho&s;e Parts, where in a good
Year they u&s;ually cure about the &s;ame
Quantity of <HI>Herrings,</HI> as the other Side
cures of <HI>Pilchards.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the Sum of the fi&s;hing &s;or Her|ring
on the feveral Coa&s;ts of <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
the Merchants of <HI>Belfa&s;t,</HI> and of <HI>London-Derry
in Ireland,</HI> have, as we are told, a
<PB N="238" REF="270">
con&s;iderable Share al&s;o in this Herring|fi&s;hing;
but I have not learn'd any Thing
of the Quantity they take.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Fi&s;hing (for
Herring and Pilchards only) amounts not
to le&s;s than fifteen Thou&s;and La&s;ts, or a
Hundred and fifty Thou&s;and Barrels, be|&s;ides
the Home Con&s;umption of the Fi&s;h
uncur'd.</P>
<P>THE next Branch of our Fi&s;hery is the
white Fi&s;h, which may be divided into
four Parts,</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fi&s;hing for Cod in the
North Seas, and which are therefore called
the <HI>North Sea Cod;</HI> the Fi&s;h taken here is
generally brought to <HI>London,</HI> and to the
Sea Ports on the Coa&s;t, and is u&s;ed princi|pally
in victualling of Ships, Coa&s;ters, and
others, for &s;hort Voyages; as al&s;o for home
Con&s;umption: So that this I take no notice
of in Trade.</P>
<P>2. THE &s;econd is, The <HI>Scots</HI> white Fi&s;h,
as they call it, which is the &s;ame kind of
Fi&s;h, and are taken upon the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from <HI>Heymouth</HI> to <HI>Dunbar,</HI>
and into the Mouth of the Firth: But nei|ther
is the Quantity great on <HI>this</HI> Side.</P>
<P>3. THE Third is, The Fi&s;hing for Cod on
the North We&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and among the
We&s;tward I&s;lands, which lie about the <HI>Lewze</HI>
and the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> where the <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> Mer|chants,
as al&s;o the <HI>London-Dery</HI> Merchants
take them; and the&s;e are u&s;ually exported to
<PB N="239" REF="271">
<HI>Spain,</HI> but not in great Quantities, that
Fi&s;hery being not improv'd to the Extent,
as it might be, for want of &s;ufficient Ad|venturers.</P>
<P>4. THE Fi&s;hing for Cod in <HI>Newfound|land,</HI></P>
<P>5. THE like Fi&s;hing on the Northern
Coa&s;t of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Fi&s;heries cure a very great Quan|tity
of Fi&s;h; and if we may credit their own
Accounts, there are not le&s;t than 200000
Quintals of Fi&s;h cur'd by them every Year:
Mo&s;t of which is &s;ent to <HI>Bilbo</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> to
<HI>Oporto</HI> and <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and to all
the Ports of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> in the <HI>Medi|terranean,</HI>
but e&s;pecially to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and
al&s;o to our other Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> be|&s;ides
what is &s;ent to the <HI>Canaries, Maderas,</HI>
and <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>THERE are two remaining Fi&s;heries be|longing
to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> I mean for Trade,
and the&s;e are,</P>
<P>1. THE Whale Fi&s;hing carried on, (1.)
for &s;ome Years on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Long I&s;land,</HI>
and <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>New York;</HI> and
now, within about three Years, by the South
Sea Company at <HI>Greenland.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE. Salmond Fi&s;hing for barrelling
up and exporting them: And this is done,</P>
<P>1. AT <HI>Aberdeen</HI> in the North of <HI>Scot|land.</HI></P>
<P>2. AT <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed</HI> on the Bor|der
of <HI>England</HI> towards <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="272">
3. AT <HI>Newfoundland</HI> (that is) within the
Rivers on the I&s;land of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI>
where they take pretty great Quantities,
and the Trade encrea&s;es every Year: But
neither of the&s;e are yet very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>THUS far the <HI>Fi&s;hing Trade</HI> in which the
<HI>Dutch</HI> are &s;aid to go beyond us as to the
Herrings and the Whales, but not to come
near us in that of the white Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>N. B. THE white Fi&s;h or Cod is a very
improving and encrea&s;ing Trade, and
employs at lea&s;t 200 or 300 Sail of
Ships or Ketches, be&s;ides &s;mall fi&s;hing
Ve&s;&s;els, without Number,</P>
<P>AS for the Exporting of Fle&s;h; it con|&s;i&s;ts
of two Parts, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Exporting of
Beef from <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well to our Colonies
in the We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> as to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE Exporting barrelled Pork from
<HI>Aberdeen,</HI> chiefly brought by the Dutch for
victualling their Ships to the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI>
and other long Voyages.</P>
<P>3. THE Exporting of Tallow, Butter,
and Hides from <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Flanders,</HI> by
the Ports of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> the&s;e
are properly annexed to the Fle&s;h, as being
Part of its Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>THESE, put together, amount to a very
great Sum, e&s;pecially the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Beef, of
which we can make no E&s;timate here.</P>
<P>3. OUR next con&s;iderable Article for Ex|portation,
is the Product of our Colonies;
that is to &s;ay, &s;uch of them as being fir&s;t
<PB N="241" REF="273">
imported from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations in
<HI>America,</HI> or from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Factories in
the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies</HI> in our own Ships, and hav|ing
been already a&s;&s;i&s;tant to our Navigation;
but being more than our Home Con&s;ump|tion
calls for, are exported again by Certifi|cate.
The Goods thus imported, are, chiefly

<P>OF the&s;e the main Articles for Re-expor|tation
are,</P>
<P>1. PEPPER, mo&s;t of which is exported
again; our Home Con&s;umption being &s;mall,
'tis exported chiefly to <HI>Italy, viz.</HI> to <HI>Leg|horn,
Genoa</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> and to <HI>France,</HI>
the Quantity u&s;ed at Home, is about 6000
Bags a Year. The re&s;t is &s;ent Abroad.</P>
<P>2. TOBACCO, the Quantity exported by
Certificate, generally &s;peaking, may be e&s;ti|mated
at about 30000 Hog&s;heads, and the
Quantity con&s;um'd in <HI>Great Britain</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> to 50000 more, in which I am
&s;ure to be a great deal within Compa&s;s. We
are told, that &s;ince the late Peace, <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="274">

Tobacco in a Year, and &s;ometimes more;
the re&s;t is exported to <HI>Holland,</HI> to <HI>Germa|ny,
Norway,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P>N.B. By the Word <HI>Germany,</HI> I am to
be under&s;tood now, and at other Times,
when &s;peaking of Marine or Trading
Affairs, the Coa&s;t of <HI>Germany,</HI> from

<P>5. SUGARS, Indigo, Ginger and Rice:
The&s;e, and the Tobacco al&s;o, as they are
the Growth of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies, and
the Returns for all the Exportations thither,
not from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> only, but
from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Afric</HI>
al&s;o, are in the Language of Trade, to be
e&s;teemed as Exportations from <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI>
and are, without Di&s;pute, Branches of
the <HI>Briti&s;h Commerce;</HI> The Value of the&s;e
is hard to determine; the Quantity of Sugar
and Rice is exceeding great, the Sugars e&s;pe|cially
which are &s;hipp'd off to <HI>Holland,</HI> and
<HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> where they are us'd
by the Sugar Bakers, as we &s;imply call them;
for they ought to be called Sugar Boilers,
but are more properly called Abroad, Sugar
Re&s;iners.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="275">
WE are &s;uppo&s;ed to export more than
40000 Hog&s;heads of Sugar a Year, one Year
with another; &s;ome times much more, as the
Crops of Sugar Abroad may yield, which
are often very different.</P>
<P>AS to the Rice, it is a new Trade, being
the Product of one Colony only, namely
of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and has been brought over in
Quantity but a few Years; but it is an en|crea&s;ing
Trade, and is now &s;pread into <HI>Pen|&s;ylvania,</HI>
and other Places: But be the
Quantity what it will, it goes mo&s;t of it
Abroad again, and is a very acceptable
Merchandize to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> (un|der&s;tood
as above) and is likely to be a very
great Article in our <HI>American</HI> Returns.</P>
<P>4. WE mu&s;t not omit here the <HI>African</HI>
Trade, as it regards the exporting Slaves
from thence to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies in
<HI>America,</HI> particularly to the I&s;lands, and to
<HI>Virginia,</HI> for the other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies do
not much make u&s;e of them, I mean, <HI>New-England,
New-York, Carolina,</HI> &amp;c. As the&s;e
Slaves are the Produce of the Briti&s;h Com|merce
in their <HI>African</HI> Factories; they are
&s;o far a Branch of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Exportation,
ju&s;t as if they were fir&s;t brought to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
landed here, and then &s;ent Abroad
again, or exported by Certificate (for it
would be the &s;ame thing) to the <HI>We&s;t In|dies,</HI>
or by the South-Sea Company to
<HI>New Spain</HI></P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="276">
THE Number of the&s;e is very great, and
the Value of them very con&s;iderable. The
Rate of <HI>Negroes</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> as it is of late
Years ri&s;en in all the Colonies, is from 20
to 25 to 30 l. a Head, according to the
Age, the Growth, and the Sex of the Ne|groes;
and if we allow 30000 to 40 and
50000 Negroes a Year to be carried away,
as (if the Trade was uninterrupted) would
be the Ca&s;e; then the Value of this Trade
at a Medium of 25 l. <HI>per Head</HI> upon all
the <HI>Negroes,</HI> amounts to no le&s;s than One
Million two hundred and fifty thou&s;and
Pound <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a Trade of infinite Advantage,
con&s;idering that the&s;e Negroes do not co&s;t
in the Country above 30 to 50 <HI>s. per</HI> Head;
and if the Trade was uninterrupted, as it
might, and I think indeed merits to be, we
&s;hould, no doubt, including the <HI>A&s;&s;iento,</HI>
carry 40 to 50000 Slaves a Year from the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and find Bu&s;ine&s;s enough
for them all in our encrea&s;ing Colonies.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Solid Enquiry into that important
Que&s;tion, whether our Trade in
general, and our Woollen Manu|facture
in particular, are &s;unk
and declined, or not.</HEAD>
<P>- WE have been very much alar|med
of late with publick
Complaints of the Decay of
our Trade; I think the Peo|ple
who thus complain, ought
to be &s;eriou&s;ly asked to ex|plain
them&s;elves, <HI>and to tell us,</HI></P>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> WHETHER they mean in general,
that the Bulk of our whole Commerce is
<PB N="246" REF="278">
le&s;&s;ened and decayed, and that there was
any Time formerly, when it was greater
than it is now.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> OR whether they mean in parti|cular,
that any of our Manufactures are un|der
Decay, that their Con&s;umption is le&s;s
now Abroad, or at Home, than it has been;
or that there is any Appearance that it may
be &s;o.</P>
<P>IF they mean the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> they ought to
tell us when that Time was, and how they
prove the Fact? Then we might enter with
them into a calm Examination of the Thing,
judge of the Calculations they make; and
by the Particulars, as they &s;hall lay them
down determine whether they complain
with Rea&s;on, or without.</P>
<P>WHILE in&s;tead of this, they content them|&s;elves
with a meer Sugge&s;tion, making a
Complaint in general, claiming to have it
be believed in the gro&s;s, as they bring it,
without farther Enquiry. This &s;eems to
be a Kind of Popery in Commerce, de|manding
our implicit A&s;&s;ent to what we
cannot believe, or they demon&s;trate; beg|ging
the Que&s;tion in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Sen&s;e,
and in &s;hort is rather a Clamour than a
Complaint, and ought to be treated as
&s;uch.</P>
<P>IF I &s;hould deal with the&s;e People, as
they deal with us, I ought to an&s;wer them
al&s;o in gro&s;s, and affirm, which I believe
I am much better furni&s;h'd with Argu|ments
<PB N="247" REF="279">
to prove, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Commerce is at this Time &s;o far from a
Decay, that it is encrea&s;ed to a Magnitude
far greater than it ever was before, and is
&s;till encrea&s;ing more and more; in a Word,
that our Trade is in a more flouri&s;hing Con|dition
than the Trade of any other Nation
in <HI>Europe,</HI> perhaps in the World.</P>
<P>IT is true, that as this is affrming with|out
Evidence, &s;o it is an&s;wering without
Proof, and is only paying them back the
&s;ame Kind they bring; but I &s;hall de&s;cend
to Particulars in its Place, and explain my
&s;elf at large; at pre&s;ent I mu&s;t go on with
the Complainers.</P>
<P>IF they mean the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> that any parti|cular
Branch of our Commerce is decay'd,
as e&s;pecially our Manufactures, which is
what they &s;eem to point at, <HI>they ought then</HI>
to have de&s;cended to the Particulars of tho&s;e
Manufactures which they &s;ay are decay'd,
&s;eeing 'tis evident &s;ome of our Manufactures
are exceedingly encrea&s;ed; nay, the Trade,
or general Term, <HI>our Manufactures,</HI> or the
<HI>Briti&s;h Manufactures.</HI> are encrea&s;ed; and
we call &s;everal Manufactures our own, and
ju&s;tly too, which never were &s;o before:
Of which al&s;o in its Order.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> HERE I &s;hould ob&s;erve, that we
ought to di&s;tingui&s;h thus between the
Decay of the general Commerce of a
Nation, and the Decay of any parti|cular
Branch of it; becau&s;e &s;ome parti|cular
<PB N="248" REF="280">
Manufacture may decay, and
even wear out, in a Country, and &s;ome
other may ri&s;e up in its Place; as the
Cu&s;tom, Fa&s;hions, and Fancies of the
Times may influence and direct, and
of which many Examples are ju&s;t now
to be &s;een among us; and yet at the
&s;ame Time the general Commerce may
not at all be decayed or decrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT to bring the Complaint mention'd
above to a Point, and to under&s;tand it, as
I &s;uppo&s;e the Complainers would be under|&s;tood,
however lamely they expre&s;s it: By
the Decay of our Trade, they &s;eem to
mean this, and no more, namely, a Decay
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufacture.</P>
<P>This they alledge is in a declining Con|dition,
and they tell us for Proof of it,
That the Con&s;umption is le&s;&s;ened, both
<HI>Abroad</HI> and at <HI>Home.</HI></P>
<P>1. THAT <HI>'tis le&s;&s;en'd;</HI> this they &s;ay is
evident, by other Nations falling into the
Way of manufacturing their own Wool;
imitating our Manufacture to great Per|fection;
their People underworking ours,
and their Trade&s;men therefore under&s;elling
ours in Price at Market; their Govern|ments
re&s;pectively, for Encouragement of
their own Poor, pre&s;&s;ing the Con&s;umption
of tho&s;e Manufactures among them &s;clves,
and prohibiting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures
being importetd into their Dominions. This
<PB N="249" REF="281">
they think amounts to a Demon&s;tration of
the Decay of our Trade.</P>
<P>To clear our Hands of Things, as we
go, I &s;hall an&s;wer this briefly, the Fact is
true, but the In&s;erence is fal&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t. The Fact is true,</HI> (in part, tho' not
in the whole) the Wealth of <HI>England</HI> ha|ving
been &s;o vi&s;ibly rai&s;ed, by the Improve|ment
of our Woollen Manufacture, (not
forgetting our loud and impolitick Boa&s;ts of
that Wealth too, and how the Woollen Ma|nufacture
has been the only Cau&s;e of it). This
has &s;et other Nations at Work as far as they
can, <HI>tho' the farthe&s;t has been but little,</HI> to
imitate tho&s;e Manufactures; to work up
their own Wool, and employ their own
Poor; and we have no Rea&s;on to blame
or reproach them with it at all; we do the
&s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> FOR the Encouragement of the
People to do thus in tho&s;e particular Coun|tries,
their Princes have, generally &s;peaking,
prohibited the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, e&s;pe|cially
&s;uch Kinds, as their Subjects can make,
from being imported into their Dominions;
nor can we blame the &s;aid Princes for this,
for we do the &s;ame. Thus far I &s;ay is
true.</P>
<P>3. BUT the Inference is fal&s;e, the Trade,
no nor the Manufacture is not decay'd for
this; the&s;e Prohibitions and Imitations
amount to no more than this, that the
People of tho&s;e Countries do make &s;ome
<PB N="250" REF="282">
woollen Goods there, &s;uch as the cour&s;e
Wool of <HI>Saxony, Poland, Bohemia,</HI> &amp;c. will
admit; and thus the poor People in tho&s;e
Countries may be &s;aid to be clothed with
their own Manufacture; but it &s;eems to be
little more, than in&s;tead of the rough Sheep-Skins,
which, 'tis known, the Boors in
tho&s;e Countries wore before: For we find
the very cour&s;e&s;t of our Ker&s;ies, Dozens,
Duffells, and <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Cloths, which are
the mean&s;t of our Manufacture, are ex|ported
even to tho&s;e northern Ports (where
they were u&s;ed to go) in as great Quanti|ties
as ever: As for the fine Medly
broad Cloths, and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cloths, which
<HI>England</HI> is &s;o particularly noted for, they
do not &s;o much as pretend to imitate, or
to prohibit them; but the Quantity ex|ported
to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> to <HI>Gottenburgh,</HI> to
<HI>Dantzick,</HI> and to all the <HI>Baltick,</HI> is as
great as ever, and perhaps greater; and if I
were to go thro' all the Ports of <HI>Europe</HI>
with the Enquiry, it would be hard to
&s;hew where the Decay lyes; but that if
one Place &s;inks, another ri&s;es; and if one
Kind of Manufacture declines, another ad|vances.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THESE Prohibitions have been,
&s;ome of longer &s;tanding, &s;uch as in
<HI>France, Pru&s;&s;ia, Sweden,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;ome
of a &s;horter Date, as now lately in <HI>Si|le&s;ia,</HI>
in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> and &s;e|veral
Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and at la&s;t in
<PB N="251" REF="283">
<HI>Spain;</HI> and we may expect the like in
other Parts.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, admitting all the&s;e Pro|hibitions
of our Manufactures, and all their
being imitated and &s;et up in foreign Parts,
<HI>as above,</HI> yet it is not ea&s;y to prove, neither
can I &s;ee Rea&s;on to allow, that the Expor|tation
of the woollen Manufacture of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
is at all le&s;&s;en'd, and con&s;equently, the
Con&s;umption Abroad is not abated, or the
Trade in particular decay'd: What Abate|ment
of the Con&s;umption may have hap|pen'd
in this, or that particular Part of the
World, is not the Ca&s;e, nor is it worth
our Debate; all Nations are, and ought to
be at Liberty to &s;et their own Poor at
Work, if they can, and to prohibit what
foreign Manufacture they plea&s;e for their
Encouragement: But as the woollen Ma|nufacture
of <HI>England</HI> is an Article the mo&s;t
extended in Trade, of any other Thing of
its Kind in the World, it cannot be ex|pected,
but it may &s;ink in one Place, and
ri&s;e in another; flouri&s;h here, and decay
there, and the demand alter, as the Cu&s;|toms
of Countries alter, and yet the Gro&s;s
of the Trade may be the &s;ame; As the
Sea, they tell us, gains in one Place upon
the Land, and the Land encroaches in ano|ther
Place upon the Sea; and yet, neither
the Sea or the Land abates or encrea&s;es in
Quantity, only vary in their Situation: And
thus it is in our Trade, the Con&s;umption of
<PB N="252" REF="284">
the Manufacture &s;preads in one Place, and
draws back in another; one Nation opens
the Door to it, and another &s;huts the Door
again&s;t it; but &s;till the Quantity goes away,
it is exported abroad, bought, &s;old, and
con&s;um'd; and we do not find any Age
pa&s;s, when more of it, either in Quan|tity
or Quality, was ever &s;ent abroad, than
is now, or &s;o much by a great deal: How
then is the Trade under a Decay?</P>
<P>3. THE next Branch of the Complaint,
is, that the Con&s;umption of our woollen
Manufacture is le&s;&s;en'd at HOME.</P>
<P>THIS indeed, tho' lea&s;t regarded, has
the mo&s;t Truth and Rea&s;on in it, and me|rits
to be more particularly enquired into:
But I might ask the very Complainer him|&s;elf
here, &s;uppo&s;ing the Fact to be true,
Why do we not mend it, and that without
Laws, without tei&s;ing the Parliament and
our Sovereign, for what they find difficult
enough to effect, even by Law? I &s;ay, Why
do not the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> by ge|neral
Cu&s;tom, and by univer&s;al Con&s;ent, en|crea&s;e
the Con&s;umption of our own Manu|factures,
by rejecting the Trifles and Toys of
Foreigners, why do we not appear dre&s;s'd
in the Growth of our own Country, and
made fine by the Labour of our own Hands?</P>
<P>All the Kings and Parliaments that have
been or &s;hall be, cannot govern our Fancies:
They may make Laws, and &s;hew you the
Rea&s;on of tho&s;e Laws for your Good; but
<PB N="253" REF="285">
two Things among us are too ungoverna|ble,
<HI>viz.</HI> our Pa&s;&s;ions and our Fa&s;hions;
the fir&s;t is at pre&s;ent out of my Way, but
the &s;econd is directly to my Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>SHOULD I ask the Ladies, whether they
would dre&s;s by Law, or clothe by Act of
Parliament, they would ask me whether
they were to be Statute Fools, and to be
made Pageants and Pictures of? Whether
the Sex were to be &s;et up for our Je&s;t, and
the Parliament had nothing to do, but
make <HI>Indian</HI> Queens of them.? That they
claim <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty, as well as the Men,
and as they expect to do what they plea&s;e,
and &s;ay what they plea&s;e, &s;o they will wear
what they plea&s;e, and dre&s;s how they
plea&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is true, that this Liberty of the La|dies,
their <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> for their <HI>Fa&s;hion,</HI> has
been frequently injurious to the Manufac|tures
of <HI>England;</HI> and is &s;o &s;till in &s;ome Ca|&s;es,
as I &s;hall ob&s;erve again in its Place;
but I do not &s;ee &s;o ea&s;y a Remedy for that,
as for &s;ome other Things of the like Na|ture.
The Ladies have &s;uffer'd &s;ome little
Re&s;traint that Way, as in the wearing <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Silks, in&s;tead of <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and Calli|coes,
and other Things, in&s;tead of wor&s;ted
Stuffs, <HI>and the like;</HI> and we do not &s;ee they
are pleas'd with it.</P>
<P>BUT as I am talking in this Article to
the Complainers, I would have them di|rect
their Complaints where they ought to
<PB N="254" REF="286">
be directed; the King and Parliament have
re&s;train'd tho&s;e Things by Law, and farther
they really cannot go; we mu&s;t turn the
Complaint to the People them&s;elves, and en|treat
them to encourage the Manufacture of
<HI>England</HI> by a more general U&s;e and Wearing
of it. This alone would encrea&s;e the Con|&s;umption,
and that alone can encrea&s;e the Ma|nufacture
it &s;elf, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its Place.</P>
<P>AND yet, if even this Part were examin'd
critically, it would appear, that the Com|plaint
is not right plac'd; the Manufacture
is not in its &s;elf declin'd &s;o much, as the
Con&s;umption is divided into &s;everal Ma|nufactures,
which perhaps were not known
before, but under one Denomination; &s;uch
as the Cotton Manufacture in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI>
and <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> the Linen Manufacture in
<HI>Scotland</HI> now become our own by the Uni|on;
and the Linen Manufacture much en|creas'd
of late in <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf, and the
&s;ame in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which tho' not our own,
we find it much for our Intere&s;t to encou|rage;
if by the Con&s;umption of the&s;e the
Con&s;umption of the Woollen Manufacture
is divided, I cannot lay this can be call'd a
Decay of our Trade, at lea&s;t as the U&s;e of
the&s;e Goods is now brought on, not in the
Room of our Woollen Manufacture, but
in the Room of the Callicocs, the U&s;e of
which was lately prohibited: They are not
there fore the Rea&s;on of any pre&s;ent Decay of
the Woollen Manufacture; but if there
<PB N="255" REF="287">
was a Decay in the Con&s;umption of the
Woollen, it was done by the &s;aid Callicoes
before; of all which I &s;hall &s;peak as I
go on.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then it does not ap|pear,
that our Manufactures are le&s;&s;en'd,
or that the Con&s;umption of them is abated
either Abroad or at Home, but rather the
contrary; and that our Trade in general,
and even our Woollen Manufacture in par|ticular,
is greatly encreas'd, and is at this
Time arriv'd to &s;uch a Magnitude, as it
was never at before. And here it occurs
to notice a particular Thing, which may
be of U&s;e to us in its Kind, on &s;everal Oc|ca&s;ions,
<HI>viz.</HI> That the Magnitude of the
Manufacture is really at pre&s;ent its only
Grievance, being encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a De|gree,
by the Ignorance and Wealth of the
Manufacturers, that it is too great for its
&s;elf; the Quantity too great for the Con|&s;umption,
or at lea&s;t too great for the Mar|ket,
tho' the Market was intirely open, and
uninterrupted by any Rival Manufacture,
or any Prohibition what&s;oever. And here I
ask to be &s;pared a Word or two of the pre|&s;ent
imprudent Encrea&s;e of the Woollen Ma|nufacture
of <HI>England,</HI> by the ill Conduct of
the Manufacturers in particular Ca&s;es; and
how unju&s;tly a Check of that Encrea&s;e is
called a Decay of the Trade.</P>
<P>AS the Veins may be too full of Blood,
&s;o a Nation may be too full of Trade; the
<PB N="256" REF="288">
fine fre&s;h Rivers, when they run with a
full and gentle Stream, are the Beauty and
Glory of a Country; they water the Mea|dows,
moi&s;ten the Earth, drive our Mills,
fill our Moats and Canals, carry our Ve&s;|&s;els,
and enrich the whole Nation; but
when &s;well'd by &s;udden and ha&s;ty Showers,
they turn rapid in their Cour&s;e, over|flow
their Banks, and ri&s;e to an undue
Height; then they turn frightful and dange|rous,
drown the Country, and &s;ometimes
the People; carry away Cattle, Stacks of
Corn, Bridges, Buildings, and whatever
&s;tands in their Way, leaving Mud, and
Sand, and Stones among the Gra&s;s, and ra|ther
&s;tarve the Land, than a&s;&s;i&s;t to make
it fruitful, and thus they become a Grievance,
not a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Publick; on the other
Hand, when by long Drought their Sour|ces
are withheld, the Streams fail, the Ri|vers
are dry, the Mills &s;tand &s;till, the Boats
lye a Ground, the Lands are parch'd up, and
the whole Country &s;uffers.</P>
<P>OUR Manufactures of Wool in this Na|tion,
bear a ju&s;t Analogy with this Ca&s;e,
like a flowing Stream, they are in their
pro&s;perous Cour&s;e the Wealth and Glo|ry
of the Country: While the Trade
flouri&s;hes Abroad and at Home, and the
Con&s;umption makes a moderate current
Demand, the Manufacture goes on at a
&s;teady, chearful, even Pace, the Wool is con|&s;um'd
and wrought up, the Poor are em|ploy'd,

the Ma&s;ter Manufacturer thrives,
the Merchant and the Shop-keepers go
on with their u&s;ual Strength, and all the
Trade flouri&s;hes.</P>
<P>1. UPON &s;ome &s;udden Accident in Trade
here comes a great unu&s;ual Demand for
Goods, the Merchants from Abroad have
&s;udden and unu&s;ual Commi&s;&s;ions, the Call
for Goods this Way or that Way encrea&s;es,
this makes the Factors &s;end large Orders into
the Country; and the Price of Goods always
ri&s;es according to the Demand: The Country
Manufacturer looks out &s;harp, hires more
Looms, gets more Spinners, gives more
Wages, and animated by the advane'd Price,
is not content to an&s;wer his new Orders
only, but he continues the Excur&s;ion he
had made into the Country for Spinners,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> runs on to an Extremity, in Quantity,
as far, or perhaps farther, than his Stock
will allow; and in a Word, gluts the Mar|ket
with the Goods.</P>
<P>2. THE. Accident of Trade, which from
Abroad fill'd the Merchants Commi&s;&s;ions,
and the Factor's Orders being over, tho&s;e
Demands are al&s;o over, and the Trade re|turns
to its u&s;ual Channel; but the Manu|facturer
in the Country, who had run out
to an unu&s;ual Exce&s;s in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, with|out
Regard to the Circum&s;tanecs of it,
having not &s;topt his Hand as his Or|ders
&s;topt, falls into the Mire; his Goods
lye on Hand, the Poor which he call'd
<PB N="258" REF="290">
from the Plow and the Dary to &s;pin and
weave, are ca&s;t off again, and not finding
their Way pre&s;ently back to their old
Drudgery, lye and &s;tarve for Want of Work,
and then they cry out Trade is decay'd,
the Manufactures are lo&s;t, Foreigners en|croach
upon, us, the Poor are &s;tarv'd, and
the like.</P>
<P>WHEREAS the Sum of the Matter is, the
Manufacturer went mad, his Stream run
over into a Flood, he run him&s;elf impru|dently
out of Breath; and upon a little
Start of the Trade, willing to furni&s;h the
Orders all him&s;elf, and loth to let a Neigh|bour
come in with him, run him&s;elf out,
drag'd the Poor into his Bu&s;ine&s;s, nay per|haps
robb'd his poorer Neighbour of his
Workmen, by giving high Wages; and
when the Trade &s;tops a little, he runs
a-ground; &s;o the Poor are &s;tarving, and
ready to mutiny for Want of Work: And
this we call a Decay of Trade, whereas
the contrary is manife&s;t &s;everal Ways.</P>
<P>TRADE mu&s;t certainly decay, if we will
run it up to &s;uch a Length, as to make
more Goods than the World can con&s;ume:
But it is not to be ju&s;tly call'd a Decay
of Trade, 'tis only abating of the Flood;
the Waters were out, and now they
are down again, and reduced to their old
Channel.</P>
<P>LET us examine a little &s;uch Accidents
as may rai&s;e or &s;ink our Manufacture as
<PB N="259" REF="291">
above, or as perhaps have done &s;o at this
Time, and &s;ee if it does not hit exactly
with this Account.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> THE late Accident of a Plague in
<HI>France.</HI> Upon that &s;ad Occa&s;ion, the Com|merce
being entirely &s;top'd between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> and indeed all other Parts of the
World, the Manufactures of the City of
<HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> in particular, and the Country
adjacent, being wholly interrupted, occa|&s;ion'd
a very great Addition to the Trade
of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> particularly for &s;uch
Manufactures as the <HI>French</HI> u&s;ed to &s;end to
<HI>Turkey,</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> and to <HI>Italy;</HI> and the
Merchants Commi&s;&s;ions from Abroad were
vi&s;ibly enlarged hither for near two Years,
upon that particular Occa&s;ion: It was plain
they cou'd have no Goods from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THE like Occa&s;ion added to the Encrea&s;e
of our Trade, upon the concluding of the
Treaty of <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> after the Confu&s;ions in
<HI>Spain</HI> had put a Check to the Trade be|tween
<HI>England</HI> and that Country, for &s;e|veral
Years; as likewi&s;e again upon the
Accommodation with <HI>Spain,</HI> after the Sur|render
of <HI>Sicily,</HI> when Trade breaking out
like the Sun after an Eclip&s;e, the Demand
for our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures, Bayes, Says,
Perpetts, broad Cloaths, Serges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was
&s;uch, that the Manufacturers thought they
could never make too many.</P>
<P>THESE Excur&s;ions are not to be ca&s;t up
in any View of the real Magnitude of
<PB N="260" REF="292">
the Trade, or of the Manufacture, any
more than the true Channel of a River is
to be judged of, or its Waters mea&s;ured
by the overflowing of a Winter's Rain, as
above.</P>
<P>NOR on the contrary is the Stop of tho&s;e
&s;udden high Demands, by any extraordi|nary
Check of the Call on like Accidents,
to be e&s;teemed a Decay of the Trade, any
more than the dry Bottom of a large River,
when the Stream withheld by a Summer's
Drought leaves the Channel empty, can de|&s;cribe
the u&s;ual Dimen&s;ions of that River,
or Quantity of its Waters.</P>
<P>SHOULD we ever &s;ee here &s;uch a fatal
Time as that was in <HI>France,</HI> when Heaven
&s;ent the Infection among them at <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI>
or as was here in 1665, <HI>God pre|&s;erve
us from it,</HI> what a general Stop
would it make to all our Trade? who would
&s;end any Commi&s;&s;ions hither for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Manufactures, when they did not know but
every Bale would have a Plague pack'd up
with the Goods, as certainly as the Bales
of Wool or Hair brought it from <HI>Cyprus</HI>
to <HI>Mar&s;eilles?</HI></P>
<P>YET this would not ju&s;tly be call'd a De|cay
of our Commerce; it would indeed be
a Wound, and a very de&s;perate Blow to it
for the Time; but as it was an Accident to
the Trade, &s;o the Cau&s;e being removed,
the Trade would revive, return to its for|mer
Channel, and be the &s;ame as before.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="293">
IF now (<HI>to return to the Ca&s;e before us</HI>)
the Manufacturers of <HI>Britain,</HI> upon any
&s;uch ha&s;ty Demand from Abroad, &s;hall run
ra&s;hly out into Extremes in their Bu&s;ine&s;s,
&s;eek out of their u&s;ual Bounds for Spinners
and Weavers, and other working People,
and draw them by Thou&s;ands, and Hun|dreds
of Thou&s;ands, as was lately the Ca&s;e,
from their other Imployments, &s;hall they
call the Stop of the&s;e ha&s;ty Demands
a Decay of Trade? 'tis a Mi&s;take, it is
no Decay, it is no more but a Return
of the Stream to its u&s;ual &s;tated Bounds,
bringing Trade into its right Channel again,
and to run as it did before: And this I
take to be the State of our Manufacture at
this Time.</P>
<P>IT is indeed &s;omething difficult to make
an exact Calculation, and judge between
the antient and the pre&s;ent Bounds of Trade,
and e&s;pecially of the Woollen Manufa|cture;
but I'll make a brief E&s;&s;ay at it.</P>
<P>THE Woll is the principal Fund of the
Manufacture, 'tis the Stock upon which it
is carry'd on. Now, be the Quantity
more or le&s;s, 'tis the fixt Boundary of the
Trade: The Manufacture cannot outrun
this Tether; the Maker can go no further
than he has Wooll. to work on; &s;ometimes
indeed one Year may borrow a little of
another, but that is generally not &s;o much
as Trade demands more or le&s;s, but as the
Stock of Wooll appears to vary: But when
<PB N="262" REF="294">
there is an apparent Decay or Advance of
the Trade in general, then it is to be &s;een
in the Wooll And thus, I remember, be|fore
the Stop was put to the free Exporta|tion
of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufacture,
the Quantity of the Wooll of <HI>England</HI> was
too great for the Manufacture; and I have
heard the Farmers complain of having two
or three Years Stock of Wooll before-hand,
and that they could not pay their Rent, be|cau&s;e
they could not &s;ell it off.</P>
<P>THEN it was our great Study to get the
Wooll con&s;um'd, as appears by the Act of
Parliament for burying in Woollen; you
may &s;ee by the Preamble to that Act, that
it was thought to be a publick Good to
wa&s;te and con&s;ume the Wooll.</P>
<P>SINCE that, we find all the Wooll in
<HI>England</HI> too little for the Manufacture; &s;o
that now we bring in all the Wooll of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
which is in &s;hort an immen&s;e Quan|tity,
tho' coar&s;e, and which went formerly
mo&s;t of it beyond Sea, and yet call for at
lea&s;t the Quantity of an Hundred thou|&s;and
Hor&s;e Packs from <HI>Ireland</HI> every Year.
This is but a very odd Te&s;timony for the
Decay of our Manufacture; on the other
hand, I think it is an unan&s;werable Proof
of what I have advanced, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that our
Woollen Manufacture is very much en|crea&s;ed:
But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>THEY that tell us of the Encrea&s;e or De|cay
of the Woollen Manufacture, &s;hould
<PB N="263" REF="295">
fix a Standard of the Trade, from a Propor|tion
to which, to denominate this En|crea&s;e
or Decay: To tell us it is &s;unk from
what it was ju&s;t at &s;uch or &s;uch a Time,
as upon a Peace, after a long Interruption
by a War, or after a Plague or the like, is
to &s;ay nothing at all. But let them take
&s;ix or &s;even Years together, and make an
E&s;timate from the Medium, take the Ex|portation
at a Medium, or take the Rate
of Wooll, and the Con&s;umption of the
Quantity at a Medium, and then their
Gue&s;&s;es (for they can be no more) may at
lea&s;t be probable.</P>
<P>IF formerly we could not con&s;ume all
our own Wooll; and now, we not only
con&s;ume our own, but all the Wooll of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and an Hundred thou&s;and Packs
a Year from <HI>Ireland;</HI> then either <HI>England</HI>
mu&s;t produce le&s;s Wooll than formerly, or
the Con&s;umption mu&s;t be &s;o much the
greater. I think, that way of Rea&s;oning
is liable to no Exception, except it be the
running it away clande&s;tinely to <HI>France,</HI>
which is trifling, and I &s;hall make it ap|pear
in its Place, that this Channel is much
&s;maller than it was formerly, when our
Wooll lay un&s;old, as above.</P>
<P>AS to the Growth of our Wooll being
alter'd, and that <HI>England</HI> produces le&s;s
Wooll than formerly, 'tis time enough to
argue upon it, when there is, or can be
one probable Rea&s;on given to &s;ugge&s;t it,
<PB N="264" REF="296">
much le&s;s Evidence to prove it; yet I mu&s;t
not wholly pa&s;s it by neither, becau&s;e, as
above, it is the only Exception.</P>
<P>IF there is any thing to be judg'd of
from Probability, it is on the other Side,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) 'tis rather probable the Quantity is
encrea&s;ed by the innumerable Number of
Acres of Land improved and enclo&s;ed with|in
the&s;e few Years, e&s;pecially in the North|we&s;t
Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and which breed and
feed greater Numbers of Sheep than ever,
and tho&s;e of a larger Breed which are pro|digiou&s;ly
encrea&s;ed in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I might run out here very profitably up|on
this Subject, and give Rea&s;ons from
the general Way of Sheep-keeping in
<HI>England</HI> at this Time, by which it wou'd
ea&s;ily be proved, that the Quantity of Wooll
is encrea&s;ed by the Encrea&s;e of the large
Breed of Sheep which are rai&s;ed now, <HI>not</HI>
on the <HI>Cot&s;wold</HI> Hills of <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI>
the South <HI>Downs, Salisbury</HI> Plains, and
&s;uch open Counties, as formerly, where the
Soil is poor, and the Sheep &s;mall, and the
Fleeces light, tho' &s;ine, and of a &s;hort Sta|ple
in Proportion to the Creatures: <HI>But</HI> in
the rich enclo&s;ed Grounds of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> and
<HI>Warwick&s;hire,</HI> the Fens of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> and
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> the l&s;le of <HI>Ely,</HI> the Mar&s;hes of
<HI>Rum$ey</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> the rich Lands on the Bank
of <HI>Tees</HI> and on the <HI>Wier</HI> in the Bi&s;hoprick of
<HI>Durham,</HI> and thro' all the Counties of
<HI>Northampton, Huntington, Hertford,</HI> and
<PB N="265" REF="297">
<HI>Bucks;</HI> for the Truth of which, I need do
no more than appeal to the Knowledge of
the honourable Repre&s;entatives of tho&s;e
Countries.</P>
<P>AS the Encrea&s;e of the&s;e Sheep is manife&s;t,
and that one of who&s;e Fleeces is equal to
three of the we&s;tern Counties, 'tis very im|probable
the Quantity of Wooll &s;hould be de|clin'd
in <HI>England;</HI> and if the Wooll is not de|clin'd,
then the only tolerable Objection is
removed, and my Argument &s;tands granted,
or at lea&s;t fully confirmed, of which this is
the Ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>WHEN the Growth of our Wooll in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
was much le&s;s than it is now, yet there
were frequent Difficulties in having it be
con&s;umed by the Manufactures.</P>
<P>NOW the Growth of Wooll in <HI>England</HI>
is encrea&s;ed, yet it is not &s;ufficient to &s;upply
the Con&s;umption of it by the Manufactures.</P>
<P>I think the Con&s;equence is natural then,
namely, that the Manufactures mu&s;t be
encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>TO bring all this to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e,</P>
<P>THE Manufactures are prodigiou&s;ly en|crea&s;ed,
whether prudently, or ra&s;hly, be|yond
a due Proportion to the Demand,
it matters not upon a Stop or Check of
that Demand, we complain of a Decay
of Trade; the Que&s;tion is, whether that
Complaint is ju&s;t?</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t, that it is not, nor does it prove
any thing of a Decay of Trade; only, that
<PB N="266" REF="298">
the Manufacturers having ra&s;hly made im|men&s;e
Quantities of Goods more than the
Trade of all <HI>Europe</HI> ever did or can call
for in a con&s;tant Demand, the Trade is re|turned
to its natural Channel, after an ima|ginary
and ca&s;ual Start out of it by the Ac|cidents
of foreign Commerce.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, upon the Occa&s;ions mentioned
above, the Manufacturers have made their
good Fortune in Trade a Bubble upon them|&s;elves,
and having over-run the Market with
their Goods, it returns upon them like the
late <HI>South Sea,</HI> and every thing goes back
from its imaginary to its intrin&s;ick Value.</P>
<P>THE Demand abates the Advancement,
the Price &s;inks, the poor Spinners and Work|folk
are di&s;mi&s;s'd to &s;tarve: But the Cau&s;e is
not in the Trade, but in the Workmen, not
in the Manufacture, but in the Manufactu|rers;
the Quantity of Goods made are too
many for the Con&s;umption, and the Market
is perhaps glutted for a Year or more to
come; and thus and no otherwi&s;e the Com|merce
is abated; that is, there is no real
Abatement of the Trade, only it mu&s;t have
Time given to wa&s;te the over-made
Quantity.</P>
<P>FROM the whole we may ob&s;erve here
how many Ways the launching out a Manu|facture
to an undue Extent may be prejudi|cial
to a Nation in general; 'tis like a Trade&s;|man
that over-trades him&s;elf, and runs out
beyond the Compa&s;s of his Stock; the Con|&s;equence
<PB N="267" REF="299">
is, that upon the lea&s;t Accident in
Trade, his Credit is &s;tagnated and &s;haken,
and the Man is undone; and 'tis a ju&s;t Ob|&s;ervation
in the Trade&s;men of this Nation,
that there are many more ruined by too
much Trade, than for Want of Trade.</P>
<P>IT is very unju&s;t and unfair Dealing by
the Publick, fir&s;t to glut the Market, and
over-run it with Goods, and then complain
that the Market is dull: How &s;hould the
Re&s;piration of Trade be pre&s;erved, when
'tis choak'd and &s;uffocated with Goods?
When <HI>Blackwell</HI> Hall is empty, the Trade
breathes; but when we &s;ee it piled up to
the Ceilings; the Yards, the Pa&s;&s;ages and
Stairca&s;es throng'd, Trade &s;uffers, it is
oppre&s;s'd with Quantity, and mu&s;t die if
not relieved.</P>
<P>LET the Trade of <HI>Great Britain</HI> go on in
its u&s;ual Channel, the Magnitude of it is
&s;ufficient of it &s;elf; all Exce&s;&s;es hurt it; I do
not think Trade receives any Advantage
from tho&s;e &s;udden Starts and Advances of
Price, as hinted above, but what the Manu|facturer
makes one Way, he lo&s;es another,
and the Poor lo&s;e by it both ways.</P>
<P>I remember after the late Plague in <HI>France,</HI>
and the Peace in <HI>Spain,</HI> the Run for Goods
was &s;o great in <HI>England,</HI> and the Price of
every thing ro&s;e &s;o high, that the poor Wo|men
in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> could earn one Shilling to
one Shilling and Sixpence <HI>per diem</HI> by
<PB N="268" REF="300">
Spinning: What was the Con&s;equence,
'twas too plain to be conceal'd.</P>
<P>THE poor Farmers could get no Dary-Maids;
the Wenches told them in so many
Words, they would not go to Service for
Twelve-pence a Week, when they could get
nine Shillings a <HI>Week at their own Hands,</HI> as
they called it; so they all run away to <HI>Bock|ings</HI>
to <HI>Sudbury,</HI> to <HI>Braintree,</HI> and to
<HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI> and other Manufacturing Towns
of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P>The very Plowmen did the &s;ame, and
the Ale-hou&s;es in the great Towns were
throng'd with them, young Fellows and
young Wenches together, till the Pari&s;hes
began to take Cognizance of them upon
another Account, too dark to talk of here.</P>
<P>WHILE this Hurry la&s;ted, the Bayes were
call'd for in prodigious Quantities, and the
Price ro&s;e from 12 <HI>d. per</HI> Ell to 16 <HI>d.</HI> be&s;ides
the Advance upon the Parcels, an Article
particular to that Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Demand &s;lack'd from
Abroad, all the&s;e loo&s;e People were turn'd
off, the Spinners went a begging, the Wea|vers
ro&s;e in Rebellion, and the Pari&s;hes
were left throng'd with Ba&s;tards, which was
all that we might &s;ay was got by that
Bargain.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, had the Merchants been ob|liged
with the Goods as fa&s;t as the ordina|ry
Numbers employ'd in the Manufacture
could have wrought them, the Market had
<PB N="269" REF="301">
held the longer, the Merchants had had
their Goods the cheaper, and the Markets
Abroad would have been &s;upplied at la&s;t
too.</P>
<P>BUT, by that unadvi&s;ed ra&s;h Hurry, no|thing
follow'd but Confu&s;ion; the Demand
&s;topt; yet the Makers run on as long as they
were able, the Bayes were pawned in every
money'd Man's Hand in the Country, and the
Price &s;unk to 11 d. <HI>per</HI> Yard at <HI>London;</HI> &s;o
that a con&s;iderable deal of Money was lo&s;t
by every Piece made, the <HI>Bay - Makers</HI>
broke by Dozens, and thus they went on;
and now they as well as the We&s;t Country
Men tell us, that the Trade is declin'd.</P>
<P>NOW is this to be called a Decay of
Trade? no not at all; there is &s;till a mode|rate
Demand, and the Trade, were the
Glut of Goods taken off, would be where it
was: But the Run has ruin'd them; the
Money to be gotten blinded the Manufac|turers,
they could not keep within the Com|pa&s;s
of their own Gra&s;p, and &s;o &s;unk in the
nece&s;&s;ary Stop of the Trade that follow'd.</P>
<P>TO judge then of the Decay of the Trade,
we mu&s;t bring it back, as I &s;aid, to a Medi|um
of Years, and &s;ee how it was carry'd on,
and to what Degree, in &s;uch a Time, for
10, or 20, or 30 Years ago, and then com|pare
it with its pre&s;ent wor&s;t Circum&s;tances,
and I venture to &s;ay, we &s;hall not find the
Trade decay'd at all, but rather encrea&s;ed
in all the Manufactures of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="302">
I have dwelt upon the encrea&s;ing Expor|tations
of our own, and Importations of
the Goods of foreign Growth, in the three
la&s;t Chapters, as an Evidence of the Magni|tude
of our Trade. If our Trade is declin|ing,
why do our Importations and Expor|tations
encrea&s;e? And if they do not en|crea&s;e,
let the Oppo&s;er of this Part tell us
the Time when they were greater, or even
equal to what they are.</P>
<P>SOME have attempted this Part, and in|deed
'tis the only way to convince us, that
our Trade is declined; for if neither our Im|portations
or Exportations are decrea&s;ed,
which Way will they go to Work to &s;hew
the Decrea&s;e of our Commerce.</P>
<P>I might enquire of the&s;e phlegmatick
Computers, fir&s;t, Whether is our Shipping
decreas'd or not? I confe&s;s, I have not yet
heard it &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;ted; and tho' it
is true, that it is not ea&s;y to determine that
Point, yet I think I am upon a Square with
the Complainers, when I &s;ay, that when
ever they plea&s;e to enter into the Computa|tion,
I &s;hall be ready to begin an Enquiry
on the other &s;ide, which I believe will be
convincing; in the mean time, let me refer
the Reader to a View of the We&s;tern Coa&s;t
of the I&s;land, and let them look narrowly
into the Encrea&s;e of Shipping at <HI>Bri&s;tol,
Liverpool, Whitehaven, Dumfreis, Gla&s;|gow,</HI>
and all the &s;maller Ports on that
Side from <HI>Pembroke</HI> Haven to the Firth of
<PB N="271" REF="303">
<HI>Clyde,</HI> and tell me if there are not a thou|&s;and
Sail of Ships more employ'd on that
Side, I mean Merchant Ships, be&s;ides Fi&s;h|ing
Boats and &s;mall Craft, more than were
ever known before. I might go round the
I&s;land, and make like Ob&s;ervations; but, as
before, I meet with no body that makes any
Objection of that kind.</P>
<P>WE have two Trades, they tell us, which
are evidently declin'd, and the Shipping,
which was u&s;ually employ'd in them, ap|parently
le&s;&s;en'd;
and the&s;e are fir&s;t, the
<HI>French</HI> Trade, and &s;econdly, the Fi&s;hing
Trade.</P>
<P>FOR the fir&s;t, <HI>'tis true,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Trade
is le&s;&s;en'd; but 'tis a Truth &s;o evidently,
and I might &s;ay &s;o infinitely, to our Advan|tage,
by our having made almo&s;t all their
Manufactures (of which we took off &s;uch
exceeding great Quantities) our own; that
no Man can with Ju&s;tice call it a Decay or
Declining of our Trade in general, that our
Trade with <HI>France</HI> is le&s;&s;en'd; on the con|trary,
'tis no more than this, all that Part
of our Trade, which we lo&s;t by, is le&s;&s;en'd,
and all that Part, which we gain'd by, is
or might be, if we pleas'd, encrea&s;ed and
pre&s;erv'd; whoever con&s;iders the Importa|tions
of wrought Silks, Brandy, Paper,
Hats, Gla&s;s, and &s;everal other Manufactures,
for which we paid <HI>France</HI> two Millions a
Year, turn'd all upon their Hands, and all
tho&s;e things &s;upply'd at Home by the La|bour
<PB N="272" REF="304">
of our own People. For even the
Gro&s;s of the Brandy, formerly <HI>French,</HI> is
now &s;upply'd by the Di&s;tillers of Malt Spi|rits
at Home, which, as to the common
Con&s;umption, is turned all into the meane&s;t
of Liquor; but however, 'tis &s;uch as the
People eagerly clo&s;e with, and by that
the Importation of Brandy is certainly re|duced
from nine thou&s;and Ton to le&s;s than
two thou&s;and Ton a Year.</P>
<P>ALL the re&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Goods, which
were formerly imported from thence, &s;o
much to our Lo&s;s, being now made at Home,
I hope no Man can be &s;o weak as to call that
a Declining or Decrea&s;e of our Trade; on
the contrary, 'tis a happy Encrea&s;e of it,
for that the Con&s;umption is at lea&s;t the
&s;ame, and our own People have the Pro|fit
of the Making; the Con&s;umption is the
&s;ame among the rich, and our own Poor
take the Money in&s;tead of the Poor of
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the <HI>French</HI> Wine Trade, the Que|&s;tion
an&s;wers it &s;elf, the Stream only is tur|ned
from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Portugal,</HI> the Quantity
of Wine con&s;umed is not the le&s;s; and as it
is farther to fetch, the Shipping is rather
encreas'd by it than abated; the Ships not
being able to make &s;o many Voyages as they
did before, there mu&s;t be the more Bot|toms,
or the more Tonnage in larger Ships
employ'd, and either of them are an Encrea&s;e
to the Navigation.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="305">
AS to the Fi&s;hing Trade being decrea&s;ed,
it is begging the Que&s;tion in a notorious
Manner, and I think needs no An&s;wering.
On the contrary we &s;ee it lately encrea&s;ed
by a very great and probable Undertaking
of the <HI>Greenland</HI> Fi&s;hery; we &s;ee al&s;o &s;eve|ral
Propo&s;als on foot for farther encrea&s;ing
the <HI>Scots</HI> Fi&s;hery, and our other Fi&s;hing
mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily encrea&s;ed by the Addi|tion
of our Dominion in <HI>Newfoundland,</HI>
by the late Peace, where our Room for en|crea&s;ing
the Fi&s;hing is greatly enlarged.
And it cannot be deny'd, but that the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Fi&s;hing on the Banks al&s;o is actual|ly
encrea&s;ed: We mu&s;t therefore be allow'd
to &s;ay that Part needs no Reply till the
Fact be prov'd.</P>
<P>LET us next enquire what one particular
Trade in all our Foreign Bu&s;ine&s;s is impair'd,
what Goods of Foreign Growth are they
which lye by us un&s;old, and with which our
Markets are glutted, or which our Merchants
give no more Commi&s;&s;ions for, being not
able to con&s;ume them at Home, or export
them to other Places Abroad.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be very brief in the Inquiry.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company;
their Trade has been crampt by Prohibiti|ons
at Home, and by new Inva&s;ions from
Abroad; their Silks and Callicoes forbidden
to be worn, in Favour of Rival Manu|factures
of Linen and Silk; their Commerce
invaded by a Rival Company at <HI>O&s;tend;</HI>
<PB N="274" REF="306">
yet we &s;ee la&s;t their Sale amounted to almo&s;t
eleven Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI>
which allowing it to be half yearly, as re|ally
is the Ca&s;e, can very ill be called a
&s;inking Commerce.</P>
<P>TAKE our Plantation Trade, the I&s;land
of St. <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI>'s being, our own by the
late Peace, we &s;ee improv'd and increas'd to
&s;uch a Degree, that the Return of Sugar,
Ginger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is now as great from thence as
from <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> and the Plantations in
<HI>Jamaica</HI> are &s;o evidently encreas'd, that
we are told in a few Years they will rai&s;e
ten Thou&s;and Hog&s;heads of Sugar and
Cocao more than ever they did before.</P>
<P>IN a Word, whereas formerly we had a
Glut of Sugar from our Colonies, and
were di&s;tre&s;s'd for a Market to di&s;po&s;e of
the Overplus, 'tis now evident, that &s;ince
the great encreas'd Con&s;umption of Coffee
and Tea in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> all our Colo|nies
are hardly able to &s;upply the Con&s;ump|tion;
and from Thirty Thou&s;and Hog&s;heads
of Sugar which formerly we imported, 'tis
certain we now import from &s;eventy to eigh|ty
Thou&s;and Hog&s;heads in a Year, from
all our Colonies, not reckoning the ex|travagant
Bulk of the Hog&s;heads, which
now generally contain from &s;eventeen
to eighteen hundred Weight of Sugar in
each Hog&s;head, one with another, &s;ome
of them much more.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="307">
IN like Manner, the Plantations in <HI>Vir|ginia</HI>
and <HI>Maryland</HI> are encrea&s;ed to &s;uch
a Magnitude, that I am told they produce
now from eighty to an Hundred Thou&s;and
Hog&s;heads every Year; a Quantity &s;o great,
Compar'd to what has formerly been pro|duced,
that if it be all di&s;po&s;ed of, no Man
can &s;ay the <HI>Virginia</HI> Trade is not infinitely
increa&s;ed; be&s;ides the great Export of Pro|vi&s;ions
from <HI>Virginia,</HI> that is to &s;ay, from
<HI>Che&s;eapeak</HI> Bay, which they &s;end to our
I&s;land Colonies, more by &s;ome Hundreds
of Sloops Loading a Year, than ever they
&s;ent before, which is one great Cau&s;e of
the <HI>Virginia</HI> Planters falling lately into the
Trade of buying Negroes from the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Africa,</HI> which they never u&s;ed to do
formerly.</P>
<P>AS our I&s;land Colonies are thus mightily
increas'd and improved, as it is mo&s;t certain
they are; their People encrea&s;ing, they
nece&s;&s;arily demand a much greater Supply
of Provi&s;ions from our other Colonies on
the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> than they had
before; and this encrea&s;es the Trade of
tho&s;e Colonies, &s;uch as of <HI>New-England,
New-York, New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> Ea&s;t and We&s;t;
<HI>Pen&s;ilvania, Carolina,</HI> as al&s;o the Trade
from the <HI>Canaries, Maderas,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Cape de
Verd</HI> I&s;lands for Salt, and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Gui|nea</HI>
for <HI>Negroes:</HI> So that here is a mani|fe&s;t
Encrea&s;e of all the Commerce of both
the Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="308">
WHERE then &s;hall we find a Decay?
where is there a Stagnation, what Trade
langui&s;hes, and where is it that we drive
le&s;s Bu&s;ine&s;s than we did before?</P>
<P><HI>Portugal</HI> will not pretend to it; I might
&s;ay the whole World is Witne&s;s to the ma|nife&s;t
Encrea&s;e of our Trade with the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e,</HI>
who alone 'tis plain take off more
of our Woollen Manufacture, &s;ince the late
Encrea&s;e of their Commerce to <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> than
both the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
u&s;ed to do before: So that our Trade to
tho&s;e Parts is extremely improv'd.</P>
<P>'TIS true, there may be &s;ome ca&s;ual A|batements
of our Exportation to &s;ome par|ticular
Parts of the World, and e&s;pecially as
Things &s;tand at this Time, by the War,
or by the un&s;ettled Circum&s;tances of the Na|tions,
with re&s;pect to Continuance of Peace
or War; yet nothing can be argued upon
that Suppo&s;ition, but what all Trades, and
all trading Nations are &s;ubject to, and ever
will be on the like Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>LET us next view the <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Le|vant</HI>
Trades, which are very great Articles,
and which bear a con&s;iderable Part in the
great Balance of our general Commerce; the
Turky Merchants have indeed complain'd,
but what is the Complaint? If the ju&s;t
Part be examin'd, it will appear to lye here,
<HI>and here only;</HI> not that the Goods they car|ry
Abroad want a Market, but that the
Silk they have brought Home, has, from
<PB N="277" REF="309">
whatever Neglect we yet know not, abated
In its u&s;ual Finene&s;s and Goodne&s;s; and that
to &s;uch a Degree, that the Manufacturers
here, that is the Weavers, could no longer
make u&s;e of it, at lea&s;t not in &s;uch Works,
and to &s;uch Purpo&s;es as they had formerly
done; and &s;o the Trade may have &s;uffer'd,
not from the Abatement of the Market
Abroad or at Home, but from the Mer|chants
not taking Care to import a good
Commodity.</P>
<P>THIS can no more be call'd a Decay or
Lo&s;s of the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade, than it would
be a Lo&s;s of the Trade now carried on by
the South Sea Company to <HI>America;</HI> if
the Returns for their Goods &s;hould be made
in a fal&s;e Coin, or in counterfeit Pieces of
Eight in &s;tead of the true; The Trade there|fore
is not &s;unk; for if the Weavers cannot
u&s;e the <HI>Turkey</HI> Silk, becau&s;e it is deficient
in Quality, they mu&s;t u&s;e other Sorts; that
is to &s;ay, fine <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Piedmont</HI> thrown
Silks, or <HI>Bengale</HI> raw Silk in the Room of it,
and 'tis certain they do &s;o. And it is worth
while to ob&s;erve on this Occa&s;ion, how far
this has been the Ca&s;e, and how the Impor|tation
of tho&s;e Silks has encrea&s;ed, as the
other has prov'd inferior; &s;o that the Silk
Trade has not been le&s;&s;en'd at all.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It was alledg'd in the late Di&s;pute
between the <HI>Throw&s;ters</HI> and the Wea|vers
before the Hou&s;e of Commons,
that as the <HI>Turkey</HI> Silks were brought
<PB N="278" REF="310">
over wor&s;e than formerly; &s;o the <HI>Ea&s;t
India</HI> or <HI>Bengale</HI> Silks came better
than ever, and accordingly were more
in Demand: For it will for ever be
true, that whatever Materials of a Ma|nufacture
are furni&s;h'd from Abroad,
and decay in Goodne&s;s, they will de|cay
in the U&s;e, &s;ink in Price, and at
length &s;ink out of Demand, or they
will make the Manufacture they are
employ'd in &s;ink in its Value, which is
&s;till wor&s;e.</P>
<P>WHERE then &s;hall we look for a Decay of
our Importations? if to the Navy, that is
already an&s;wered in the Di&s;cour&s;e of the
Shipping: If the Number of Ships employ'd
is not abated, as I believe our wor&s;t Enemies
will not &s;ugge&s;t, then our Commerce to the
Ea&s;t Country cannot be abated; by our Ea&s;t
Country Trade, is always under&s;tood our
Trade in Hemp, Flax, Tar, Pitch, Iron,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> That is to &s;ay in general, Naval Stores;
Now, 'tis manife&s;t by the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e
Books (to which I refer) that the&s;e are not
abated; but on the contrary, very much
encrea&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding our great Im|portation
of Tar, Oyl, Ma&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from
our own Colonies.</P>
<P>IN what Part of the World then is our
Trade decay'd, and in what Branch of our
Bu&s;ine&s;s does it lye? for tho&s;e People than
in&s;i&s;t upon the Decay of our Trade, and
that make &s;uch loud Complaints about it,
<PB N="279" REF="311">
ought to let us know they do not rai&s;e
groundle&s;s Complaints, that would be call'd
Clamour and Di&s;affection, and would look
like &s;omething particularly piquant, which
I am loth to &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore call upon them for their
Explanations, and to let us &s;ee the Place
where our Trade is decay'd, and what
Goods they are, the Con&s;umption of which
is le&s;&s;en'd and decay'd either at Home or
Abroad; with &s;uch needful De&s;criptions of
Trade in general, as may convince us there
is no equivalent Encrea&s;e in other Branches
to make it up, and to balance the Abate|ment.</P>
<P>THE immediate Reply to this, is what
I have mention'd already, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The mi|micking
our Woollen Manufacture in &s;eve|ral
Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> by which the De|mand
of tho&s;e Manufactures from <HI>England</HI>
is abated, and may in Time be laid a&s;ide in
tho&s;e particular Countries, &s;uch as our
Bays, Flannels, Chamlets, Says, and &s;eve|ral
other kinds of Goods.</P>
<P>BUT what does this amount to in the
general Article of our great Manufacture?
let particular Ca&s;es be what they will, let
<HI>Saxony, Swi&s;&s;erland, Piedmont, Au&s;tria,</HI>
and Twenty more Places, if you could
name them, interfere with, &s;upplant or pro|hibit
this or that Manufacture, and make
a vi&s;ible Decrea&s;e of the Con&s;umption here
or there: If the Con&s;umption is encreas'd
<PB N="280" REF="312">
in other Parts of the World, be it a Thou|&s;and
Miles, or Ten thou&s;and Miles from
<HI>Germany,</HI> the thing is an&s;wered, the Ma|nufacture
is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion lies nearer Home, the En|quiry,
like the &s;earching for a Di&s;ea&s;e, is in the
vital Part; the Search is at the Heart, if the
Pul&s;e of the Trade beats true and &s;trong,
the Body is &s;ound, Wind and Limb; is in a
State of Health, and flouri&s;hing in &s;pight
of all the little Ca&s;ualties that may happen
in other remote Parts.</P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion in the Manufacture has
no difficulty at all in it; and yet it &s;eems
that tho&s;e Gentlemen who in&s;i&s;t upon the
Decay of the Manufacture do it upon the
Pre&s;umption, that there is no coming at the
Negative; but I &s;hall put it upon a Cer|tainty
which perhaps they may not fore&s;ee.
The Que&s;tion is in few Words (as before) Is
the Quantity of Wooll wrought up, or is it
not? If all our Wooll is wrought up, nay
if it is not &s;ufficient for the Manufacture,
then the Manufacture cannot be declined.</P>
<P>IT is within the&s;e Five and twenty Years,
that we found the Wooll of <HI>England</HI> lye on
Hand un&s;old, and the Farmers in the Sheep-feeding
Countries, &s;uch as <HI>Northampton,
Leice&s;ter, Lincoln, Warwick, Norfolk,</HI>
and many other Places, had generally two
or three Years Wooll upon their Hands
un&s;old, and the Price low, and very little
Demand for it.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="313">
BUT now, and e&s;pecially &s;ince the &s;eve|ral
Acts prohibiting the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Silks,
Callicoes, Chints, and other Goods of
that Kind, we find the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wooll not
only all u&s;ed up at Home, but al&s;o the
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI> Wooll brought over in
unu&s;ual Quantities to help; and yet the Price
holds up, and there is no Glut of Wooll in
the whole I&s;land; how then can the Manu|facture
be declin'd? unle&s;s you will fir&s;t
make it appear, that the Quantity of Wooll
is abated in <HI>England,</HI> which I believe will
not be pretended, and if it were, would
be hard to prove.</P>
<P>I might very profitably employ a whole
Chapter here to prove to you, that the
Quantity of Wooll in <HI>England</HI> is &s;o far
from being le&s;&s;en'd and decrea&s;ed, that it
is greatly encrea&s;ed for many Years pa&s;t,
and continues every Year to encrea&s;e: I
could prove it by proving the Encrea&s;e of
the Number of Sheep in <HI>England;</HI> and the
Encrea&s;e of Sheep would be prov'd pa&s;t
Contradiction, by the Improvement of Cul|ture,
the enclo&s;ing va&s;t Tracts of Land in
almo&s;t all Parts of <HI>England</HI> which lay open
before; and which being now improved
either by the Plowman, or by the Grazier,
&s;till occa&s;ions greater flocks of Sheep, and
tho&s;e of the be&s;t and large&s;t Kind, to be
&s;ed than were before.</P>
<P>I could add to it the va&s;t Improvement
made on the North-we&s;t and Ea&s;tern Coa&s;ts
<PB N="282" REF="314">
of <HI>England,</HI> as al&s;o on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Wales,</HI>
by &s;aving and draining Lands from the Sea,
and from the Rivers, by which multitudes
of Sheep are fed, as they are in <HI>Rumney</HI>
Mar&s;hes mention'd above: The almo&s;t in|credible
Improvement of Land in the Coun|tries
of <HI>Cumberland, Durham</HI> and <HI>Nor|thumberland,</HI>
by which the Number of
Sheep are encrea&s;ed on that Side the Coun|try
in a Manner, I &s;ay, hardly to be be|lieved.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o &s;peak of the improv'd Me|thods,
even in the breeding and feeding of
Sheep, by rai&s;ing them upon the plow'd and
fallow Lands, upon Salt Mar&s;hes, and other
Grounds, &s;uch as were never known by our
Ance&s;tors to feed Sheep before. And,
<HI>la&s;tly,</HI> I might in&s;i&s;t upon an Article little
con&s;idered, but which is really of more
Importance as to the Encrea&s;e of Wooll
than all the re&s;t, <HI>Namely,</HI> that the Nation
is univer&s;ally fallen into a way of breeding
larger Sheep than they did before: So that
not only the Numbers of Sheep are encrea|&s;ed
by many Thou&s;ands of Acres being em|ploy'd
to feed and breed, which never fed
a Sheep before; but even the Sheep them|&s;elves
are of a different Kind, and two
Sheep produce more Wooll than three
Sheep, and in &s;ome Places, than four Sheep
did before. To bring this into Evidence,
we need do no more than appeal to the mean|e&s;t
of the Country People in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="315">
and <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire;</HI> in the fir&s;t you will &s;ee
the feeding and breeding of large Sheep
&s;pread from the Country of <HI>Lincoln</HI> only,
to which formerly it was confin'd, into all
the level Grounds, Mar&s;hes and Fens of
<HI>Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Hunting|ton;</HI>
from the County of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> the
&s;ame Breed of Sheep is &s;pread into the
Counties of <HI>Warwick, Stafford</HI> and <HI>North|ampton,</HI>
and even the &s;maller Breeds of
tho&s;e Counties, which they now call
Stubble Sheep, and which feed on the fal|low
and common Fields, are of a larger
kind than ever before.</P>
<P>TO look into the North, we &s;ee the Im|provement
in the Countries of <HI>Durham</HI>
and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> running all into a
large Breed of Sheep; and you may buy as
large Mutton at the Markets in the City of
<HI>Durham,</HI> as any you can buy at <HI>Leaden|hall;</HI>
I affirm it, and dare bring it to a
Proof on any ju&s;t Occa&s;ion; and we &s;ee
large <HI>Northumberland</HI> Sheep brought up
yearly for Sale in great Droves into all
the&s;e Southern Parts of <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially
into <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Suffolk.</HI></P>
<P>IF then there were no Encrea&s;e in the
Numbers of our Sheep, the contrary of
which is true to a Demon&s;tration; yet if
we run into a larger Breed, the Wooll may
&s;till be encrea&s;ed as much as if the Numbers
were encrea&s;ed; but as it is apparent that
both the Breed is altered, and the Genera|lity
<PB N="284" REF="316">
of the Sheep-breeders run into another
larger Kind, and the Numbers of Sheep by
the Encrea&s;e of Culture and Enclo&s;ure is
encrea&s;ed al&s;o. How then can we pretend
the Quantity of Wooll in <HI>England</HI> is de|clin'd?
The Weight of this Part of the
Argument may be &s;um'd up thus.</P>
<P>IF the Numbers of Sheep are not de|crea&s;ed,
nor the Breed of the Sheep dege|nerated,
then the Quantity of our Wooll
cannot be decrea&s;ed or abated.</P>
<P>IF the Quantity of Wooll is not abated,
and yet it does not lye on hand, and want a
Market, then the whole Growth of our
Wooll is evidently u&s;ed up and manufa|ctured;
for it would not be bought if it
could not be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>AGAIN, take it in the Rever&s;e.</P>
<P>IF our whole Growth of Wooll is not
only bought and u&s;ed up, but that we buy
great Quantities of Wooll and Woollen
Yarn from <HI>Ireland,</HI> to &s;uch a Degree, as has
been &s;aid, that it amounts to an hundred
thou&s;and Packs a Year: Then 'tis evident
that the whole Growth of our Wooll is not
equal to our Manufacture.</P>
<P>IF it is true, that our whole Growth of
Wooll is not equal to our Manufacture;
that is to &s;ay, that it is not &s;ufficient for
our Supply; but that greater Quantities than
ever are brought in every Year from <HI>Ire|land</HI>
and <HI>Scotland,</HI> all of which (clande&s;tine
Trade excepted) is u&s;ed up, and manufa|ctured
<PB N="285" REF="317">
in this Part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> called
<HI>England,</HI> as has been proved: Then the
Manufacture of Wooll in <HI>England</HI> cannot
be le&s;&s;en'd or decay'd; but on the contrary,
is evidently improv'd and encreas'd.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> As to the Exception for clande|&s;tine
Trade; it is mentioned indeed to
anticipate any Cavil which might be
rai&s;ed upon the Omi&s;&s;ion, as if we did
not know there was &s;uch a Trade as
owling or running of Wooll carried on
among us; but the Quantity &s;o carried
off, tho' too much, with Re&s;pect to
the Injury done our Trade, yet is
&s;mall, and indeed not worth naming,
in compari&s;on of the Bulk of Wooll,
which the Growth of the whole King|dom
produces, and of which we are
now &s;peaking.</P>

of our other Goods, the Growth
or Manufacture of England, or
the Home Con&s;umption of them is
decrea&s;ed or declined.</HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE mentioned the Produce of
our Colonies, and prov'd that
they are evidently encrea&s;ed, as
well in their Exports to one ano|ther,
as in the Con&s;umption and Re-expor|tation
of their Produce here in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I have mentioned the Encrea&s;e of our
Woollen Manufacture, and prov'd it to a
Demon&s;tration by the Con&s;umption of the
Wooll.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems only to remain, that we &s;hould
enquire into &s;ome other Trades which are
profitably carry'd on among us, and &s;ee
whether they are not declin'd in Proporti|on,
and to make way for the Encrea&s;e of
the Woollen Manufacture; for if other
Branches of Commerce are declin'd in Pro|portion,
the Woollen Manufacture, how|ever
<PB N="287" REF="319">
great, may be encrea&s;ed, and yet our
Trade in general be declin'd too, and at the
&s;ame Time.</P>
<P>BUT I per&s;uade my &s;elf, It will be hard
to find any part of the Product of <HI>England</HI>
which can be &s;aid to be declin'd and de|crea&s;ed,
either in its Exportation to Coun|tries
Abroad, or in its Con&s;umption at
Home.</P>
<P>THE Product of <HI>England</HI> has been alrea|dy
at large de&s;crib'd, the Wooll is &s;et in
the Front as the Chief, and it is &s;o; but it
is not the only Product, nor are the Wool|len
Manufactures the only things which
employ the People of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;et their
Hands to Work; there are &s;everal Manu|factures
in <HI>England</HI> which employ a va&s;t
Number of People in which the Wooll is
no way concern'd, and upon Examination,
we &s;hall find, (1.) &s;ome of the&s;e are wholly
now a mere modern Improvement, and on
which no Hands were &s;et to Work, no
Stock employ'd before.</P>
<P>2. OTHERS, tho' known before, are
yet exceedingly improv'd and encreas'd,
and con&s;equently employ many Hands which
were unemploy'd before, which in &s;hort
is the e&s;&s;ential Part of all Improvement
in Trade.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give Examples of &s;ome of tho&s;e
Manufactures, which are more remarkable
than others, and by which the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable
Number of Poor are employ'd,
<PB N="288" REF="320">
and Materials con&s;um'd; for the re&s;t, it
&s;hall &s;uffice only to name them.</P>
<P>1. THE <HI>Bone Lace</HI> Manufacture. It is
true, that there was always, perhaps, for
&s;ome Ages pa&s;t, a Manufacture of <HI>Bone
Lace</HI> carry'd on in <HI>England;</HI> but the Im|provement
and Encrea&s;e of it within about
20 to 30 Years pa&s;t is &s;uch, and &s;o vi&s;ible,
that he mu&s;t be utterly ignorant of Trade
that is not convinc'd of it. In former
Times, the chief Place for this Manufacture
was about <HI>Buckingham, Stony Stratford,</HI>
and <HI>Newport Pagnaell,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Newport
Pannel;</HI> you have it now &s;pread, almo&s;t
entirely over the Counties of <HI>Buckingham,
Bedford</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> and far into the Coun|ties
of <HI>Berks, Northampton, Cambridge,
Hertford</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> e&s;pecially where any
or all tho&s;e Counties border on the fir&s;t;
It is al&s;o erected in the We&s;t, and e&s;pecially
in the Counties of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> and <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI>
where particularly at <HI>Blandford</HI> they make
Lace of an exceeding high Price, and not
outdone, <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> Lace excepted, by any
out of <HI>Fl$nders, France,</HI> or even <HI>Venice</HI> it
&s;elf. In a word, this Manufacture is &s;o
much encrea&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> that it employs
many Thou&s;ands of our People more than
ever; and if I may credit the Report of
the Country where 'tis chiefly made, where
one was employ'd by it 30 Years ago, above
100 are employ'd by it now, and the&s;e of
the mo&s;t idle, u&s;ele&s;s and burthen&s;ome Part
<PB N="289" REF="321">
of our People (I mean &s;uch as were &s;o be|fore)
are the principal Hands employ'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> the younger Women, and female Chil|dren.
The&s;e were a real Charge upon the
diligent laborious Poor, &s;uch as the Hu&s;|band-men,
the Farmers, and the Handi|crafts
of other Trades; and are now made
able to provide for them&s;elves, and ea&s;e
their Parents and Pari&s;hes of a dead Weight,
which was in many Ca&s;es in&s;upportable;
but I cannot dwell upon the Particulars,
which otherwi&s;e would be profitably enqui|red
into. In &s;hort, 'tis believ'd there are
above an Hundred Thou&s;and Women and
Children employ'd, and who get their Bread
by this Manufacture, more than did for|merly;
for 'tis the Encrea&s;e of It that I am
now di&s;cour&s;ing of; and this Encrea&s;e has
an Effect upon the general Commerce of
this Kingdom, very much to the Advantage
of <HI>England,</HI> for Example.</P>
<P>1. IN employing all this great Number
of People in a Manufacture which em|ploy'd,
as may be rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd, the
like Number of People in another Country,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) in <HI>Flanders:</HI> &s;o that it may be &s;aid
to be taking the Bread out of the Poor of
<HI>Flanders,</HI> and putting it into the Mouths
of the Poor of our own Country.</P>
<P>2. IT is a Turn in the Balance of Trade
to the Advantage of <HI>England,</HI> in &s;upplying
us with the &s;ame Quantity of Goods by the
Labour of our own Poor, which we, till
<PB N="290" REF="322">
now, bought abroad, and which buying
abroad, was always attended with this as a
Con&s;equence, that either we paid for them
in Money, or in our own Manufactures;
whereas (if the fir&s;t) that Money, is now
kept at Home; and (if the la&s;t) tho&s;e Ma|nufactures
mu&s;t be paid for to us in Money,
as they certainly are.</P>
<P>2. ANOTHER encreas'd Manufacture is
that of wrought Iron and Bra&s;s: I need
not refer to the Towns of <HI>Birmingham</HI> and
<HI>Sheffield,</HI> and the People of <HI>Hallam&s;hire,</HI>
a Di&s;trict well known to the Nailers and
hard Ware Men of <HI>Barn&s;ely</HI> and <HI>Rother|ham:</HI>
But I appeal to the Iron Works of the
late Sir <HI>Ambro&s;e Crowley,</HI> and his Son Al|derman
<HI>Crowley,</HI> at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne;</HI>
and above all, to the &s;ame &s;ort employ'd in
<HI>London,</HI> where they certainly make the
be&s;t Cutlery Ware at this Time in the
World.</P>
<P>IT is not many Years &s;ince the be&s;t
Sci&s;&s;ars, the be&s;t Knives, and the be&s;t Ra|zors
were made in <HI>France,</HI> and the like of
the fine Watches, Tweezars, and other
&s;mall Ware; nothing is more evident in
Trade at this Time, than that the be&s;t
Knife Blades, Sci&s;&s;ars, Surgeons In&s;truments,
Watches, Clocks, Jacks and Locks that are
in the World, and e&s;pecially Toys and gay
Things are made in <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>London</HI>
in particular; and our Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Books,
will make it appear, that we &s;end daily great
<PB N="291" REF="323">
Quantities of wrought Iron and Bra&s;s into
<HI>Holland, France, Italy, Venice,</HI> and to all
Parts of <HI>Germany, Poland</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>IN a Word, no particular Manufacture
can be nam'd, which has encrea&s;ed like this
of the hard Ware, I mean, in <HI>Great Bri|tain;</HI>
and 'tis &s;till an encrea&s;ing Manufa|cture:
To make Calculations, and Compari|&s;ons,
&s;eems to be piquant in the Ca&s;e, and
particularly pointed at this or that Nation;
but let it point where it will, the Fact is
plain; 'tis the like in the gro&s;&s;er Part of the
Trades, as our Toys, Sci&s;&s;ars, Razors, Knife
and Sword Blades outdo the <HI>French;</HI> &s;o
our common Bombs, Shells, Grenades, Cal|drons,
and all &s;orts of ca&s;t Iron, as much
outdo the <HI>Germans,</HI> the <HI>Legois,</HI> or the
<HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>IT is the like in wrought Bra&s;s; mo&s;t of the
Bra&s;s Locks of all the fine Palaces in <HI>France,</HI>
if narrowly in&s;pected, will be found to be
<HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the fine Gold Watches in the
Pockets of the Grand Seignior, the Czar
of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and the Sophy of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or
the great Mogul, are generally <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI>
We &s;end our Toys to the Court of <HI>France,</HI>
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Knives and Razors have
quite outdone the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>BY this Means it comes to pa&s;s, as I am
well a&s;&s;ur'd, that there are above 200000
People employ'd in the Manufacture of
Iron and Bra&s;s in <HI>England,</HI> more than ever
were before: Perhaps this may be of the
<PB N="292" REF="324">
mo&s;t as to Numbers, nor will I take that
Part upon my &s;elf, tho', if it be true,
that the late Sir <HI>Ambro&s;e Crawley</HI> did em|ploy
30000 People in his own particular
Part, the re&s;t may be more than probable.
But this, upon the whole, will (I doubt
not) be allow'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that there is a vi&s;ible
Encrea&s;e of our Trade in Iron and Bra&s;s, as
well as it is a Manufacture, as it is a Mer|chandice;
for there is a manife&s;t Encrea&s;e
of the Exportation and Home Con&s;umpti|on,
as well as an Encrea&s;e of Employment
for the People.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> IN this Article &s;hould be included
the Mines of Copper lately improv'd
in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> as al&s;o the
<HI>Battery</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;s Mills</HI> and <HI>Founda|ries,</HI>
which are in them&s;elves very
con&s;iderable; and if we may credit the
Repre&s;entations made to the Parlia|ment
a few Years &s;ince, do employ
many Thou&s;ands of our People more
than were ever employ'd in tho&s;e
things before.</P>
<P>THESE are Improvements in Manufa|cture
and Trade; and as they te&s;tify an En|crea&s;e
of Trade, we can &s;ee no Room yet
to &s;ugge&s;t that the Trade of <HI>England</HI> in
general is declin'd or decay'd.</P>
<P>3. THERE are &s;ome other Articles yet
more con&s;iderable than the&s;e, and one of
them is the broad Silk Manufacture; I can|not
pa&s;s it over; it is an Encrea&s;e of this
<PB N="293" REF="325">
very Age. It is a Surpri&s;e to the World, as
well in its Quantity as in its Value, and in the
admirable Perfection which our People are
arriv'd to in it, and the little Time they
have had to rai&s;e it to the Degree which it
is arriy'd to.</P>
<P>IT is but a very few Years ago, that the
making of broad Silks bega$ i$ <HI>England;</HI>
the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Italians</HI> carried the
World before them (as to Trade) in $word$ par|ticular
Article; what Attempts had been
made in <HI>England</HI> were chiefly at <HI>Canter|bury</HI>
by the <HI>Walloons</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Re$ugees,
and they were &s;o beaten out by the <HI>Ea&s;t
India</HI> Silks, that if I am not mi&s;inform'd,
there were not 20 Looms left at Work in
the whole City of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> &s;ome &s;ay, not
half &s;o many.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>French</HI> Trade prevail'd, and
before the Stop of Commerce between the
two Kingdoms began by the late War, the
mo&s;t moderate Calculations valued the
broad Silks which were imported from
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Itally</HI> at 1200000 Pounds <HI>Ster|ling
per Annum;</HI> &s;ome &s;ay, we took off as
much as that Value in the <HI>French</HI> Silks
only, whereof one Half at lea&s;t in <HI>Alamodes</HI>
and <HI>Lu&s;trings,</HI> the Manufacture of <HI>Lyons,</HI>
and the Provinces upon the <HI>Rho&s;ne.</HI></P>
<P>BUT be it &s;o or not; for we are not adju&s;t|ing
the Value of Things, in that or any other
Part of that Country, but the general Tide
or Current of the whole Trade; of which I
<PB N="294" REF="326">
might venture to &s;ay, it was known to the
whole World, that is to the whole trading
World, that it run to the Advantage of
<HI>France,</HI> with a full Stream directly from <HI>En|gland;</HI>
I mean as to the Silk Manufacture,
all which Trade is now &s;unk, I &s;ay, &s;unk
and lo&s;t as to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> to the in|finite
Advantage of <HI>England;</HI> and this not
that <HI>England</HI> may be &s;aid to leave off wear|ing
Silk: No, far from it; as our Wealth
is encrea&s;ed, we do not pretend our Pride
or Vanity is abated; our Ladies go as gay,
and our Hou&s;es are furni&s;h'd as rich as ever,
and perhaps more &s;o, and in the &s;ame
Kinds and &s;orts of Silks, Lu&s;trings, Man|tuas,
Velvets, <HI>Padua</HI> Soys, Garden Sattins,
the be&s;t and riche&s;t Brocades, and the be&s;t
and riche&s;t of all &s;orts of Silks: But the
Difference lies here, that whereas we bought
them before, now we make them at Home;
we &s;et the <HI>French</HI> Men of <HI>Tours,</HI> of
<HI>Lyons, Avignon,</HI> and the Countries about
them at Work before, and the <HI>Italians</HI> of
<HI>Milan, Mantua Genoa, Florence</HI> and
<HI>Naples,</HI> and paid them all at a va&s;t Expence
of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money, a Profu&s;ion of Money,
even a Million 200000 <HI>l. Sterling</HI> a Year;
whereas now our own Poor gain all that
Money; our own Merchants import the
Materials, our own Manufacture purcha&s;es
the Silk, the Drugs and Dye Stuffs; and
the whole Manufacture of broad Silk is
an Encrea&s;e upon our Commerce. But I
<PB N="295" REF="327">
&s;hall &s;ay no more of this here, becau&s;e I
&s;hall have Occa&s;ion to mention it again,
when I come to &s;peak of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People
improving upon the Manufacture and In|ventions
of other Nations.</P>
<P>4. I proceed therefore to another vi&s;ible
Encrea&s;e of Trade, which &s;preads daily
among us, and affects not <HI>England</HI> only,
but <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> al&s;o, tho' the
Con&s;umption depends wholly upon <HI>En|gland;</HI>
and this is printing or painting of
Linen. The late Acts of prohibiting the
U&s;e and wearing of painted Callicoes, ei|ther
in Cloths, Equipages or Hou&s;e Furni|niture,
was without Que&s;tion aim'd at im|proving
the Con&s;umption of our Woollen
Manufacture, and in Part it had an Effect
that way.</P>
<P>BUT the Humour of the People running
another way, and being u&s;ed to, and plea&s;ed
with the light, ea&s;ie and gay Dre&s;s of the
Callicoes, the Callicoe Printers fell to
Work to imitate tho&s;e Callicoes, by making
the &s;ame Stamps and Impre&s;&s;ions, and with
the &s;ame Beauty of Colours upon the
Linen, and that this fell upon the two par|ticular
Branches of Linen, call'd <HI>Scots</HI>
Cloth and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Linen: I need not take
any Pains to prove this. The Con&s;equence is
al&s;o evident, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the Linen Manu|facture
both in <HI>Scotland</HI> and in <HI>Ireland</HI> are
con&s;iderably encreas'd upon that Occa&s;ion,
and many hundred thou&s;and Ells of Linen
<PB N="296" REF="328">
are yearly imported from <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI>
and printed in <HI>England,</HI> more than ever
were before; &s;o that this is an Article whol|ly
new in Trade, and indeed the Printing
it &s;elf is wholly new; for it is but a few
Years ago &s;ince no &s;uch thing as painting
or printing of Linen or Callicoe was known
in <HI>England;</HI> all being &s;upply'd &s;o cheap, and
perform'd &s;o very fine from <HI>India,</HI> that no|thing
but a Prohibition of the foreign printed
Callicoes could rai&s;e it up to a Manufacture
at Home; whereas now it is &s;o encrea&s;ed,
that the Parliament has thought it of Mag|nitude
&s;ufficient to lay a Tax upon it, and a
con&s;iderable Revenue is rai&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>IT may be enquired here concerning the
great Numbers of People employ'd in the&s;e
Improvements, what were they employ'd
in before? and how do we call it an Im|provement,
if they are only taken from one
Manufacture into another.</P>
<P>THIS might be fully an&s;wered, if we had
Room here to enquire critically in the &s;eve|ral
Counties where tho&s;e particular Im|provements
are made; we &s;hould there find,
that in almo&s;t all the Improvements and En|crea&s;e
of Bu&s;ine&s;s above mentioned, &s;uch as
the Manufactures of Bone Lace, the Bra&s;s
and Iron Manufactures, the Haberda&s;hery;
and in a Word, all the other improv'd
Manufactures, except that of Broad Silk
weaving, the People employ'd were not at
all employ'd in the Woollen Manufactures
<PB N="297" REF="329">
before, but were, generally &s;peaking, out
of Bu&s;ine&s;s, idle and unemploy'd, there be|ing
no &s;uch thing as Woollen Manufactures
&s;ettled in the Counties and Towns where
tho&s;e Improvements have been made, &s;uch
as <HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Bedford&s;hire Shef|field,
Birmingham,</HI> and <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon
<HI>Tyne.</HI></P>
<P>THE broad Silk Trade indeed, being
chiefly carried on in the Cities of <HI>London,</HI>
might be &s;aid to employ &s;ome of the Peo|ple
formerly employ'd in the Woollen Ma|nufacture
in the &s;ame Place, (<HI>viz.) Spittle-Fields:</HI>
But then it mu&s;t be added, that
even that Encroachment was only upon
the Abatement of &s;uch Woollen Goods in
that Place, which were imprudently launch|ed
out into before, upon the fooli&s;h Ex|pectation
of a great Encrea&s;e of the Wool|len
Trade, by the Prohibitions of <HI>Ea&s;t In|dia</HI>
Goods; &s;o that even in this Part the
Silk Trade has very little, if at all en|croach'd
upon the Woollen, tho', if it had,
the Exchange had very little alter'd the
Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole, after the narrowe&s;t
Search, and with the utmo&s;t Imparti|ality,
I cannot &s;ee that we have any Room
to &s;ay our Trade is decreas'd, whether we
&s;peak of our Woollen or other Manufactures;
whether of Goods imported or exported;
whether of the Home Con&s;umption, or the
<PB N="298" REF="330">
Con&s;umption of our Growth Abroad. On
the contrary, we have great Rea&s;on to in|&s;i&s;t,
that our whole Trade is encrea&s;ed to a
very great Degree; it remains only in a &s;um|mary
Way, to account for the Encrea&s;e
of our Commerce both Abroad and at
Home.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Improvement of the Engli&s;h

<P>_IT is a Kind of Proverb attending
the Character of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men,
That they are <HI>better to improve

which is &s;till more, the Thing &s;eems to be
really true in Fact, and the Ob&s;ervation
very ju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="332">
WHETHER this Reproach upon them is
rai&s;ed upon the Sugge&s;tions of Foreign Ob|&s;ervers,
or whether it be our own upon
our &s;elves, is not worth while to examine; it
&s;eems we are very willing to grant the Fact.</P>
<P>UPON this Suppo&s;ition then my Subject
&s;eems to be adapted to the national Tem|per;
I offer here a Scene of Originals, for
the improving Genius of our People to
work upon a Stock of Invention for them
to improve upon: May they take the Hint,
try their Hands, and go to Work upon
them with the u&s;ual Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>HENCE mo&s;t of our great Advances in
Arts, in Trade, in Government, and in
almo&s;t all the great Things, we are now
Ma&s;ters of, and in which we &s;o much exceed
all our Neighbouring Nations, are really
founded upon the Inventions of others;
whether tho&s;e fir&s;t Inventers were private
Men, or Nations of Men, 'tis not material.</P>
<P>EVEN our Woollen Manufacture it &s;elf,
with all the admirable Improvements made
upon it by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;ince it came
into their Hands, is but a building upon
other Mens Foundations, and improving
on the Inventions of the <HI>Flemings:</HI> The
Wooll indeed was <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but the Wit
was all <HI>Flemi&s;h;</HI> we had the Materials,
but no more under&s;tood the Virtue of them,
than the World under&s;tood the Making
Gun-powder, tho' they had always the
Sulphur and Salts, which are now the
<PB N="301" REF="333">
proper Ingredients of that dreadful Com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>WE had the Wool, but under&s;tood
neither how to comb it or card it, &s;pin it
or weave it; nay, we cannot be &s;aid to
know, that it was capable of tho&s;e manu|al
Operations, or what Spinning and Wea|ving
was, any more than if we had not
known what the Wool was: But when, <HI>as
has been ob&s;erv'd,</HI> by the Direction of King
<HI>Henry</HI> VII. the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were put upon the
general Notion of Improvement, inform'd
of the Profit of manufacturing it, and but
once directed how to go about it, by the
<HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Agents hir'd to in&s;truct them:
How &s;oon did they outdo their Teachers,
and to what a Pitch of Improvement did
they ri&s;e in a few Years? Till now we &s;ee
the World ambitious of imitating us in
the &s;ame Manner, and to rival our Manu|factures,
are obliged to hire In&s;tructers
from hence, and to learn of tho&s;e who were
them&s;elves but Learners before.</P>
<P>I might enter into almo&s;t all the Im|provements
of Art in which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
&s;o much now excel the re&s;t of the World:
How in &s;everal Manufactures we have
turn'd the Scale of Trade, and &s;end our
Goods to be &s;old in tho&s;e very Countries
from whence we deriv'd the Knowledge
and Art of making them.</P>
<P>THUS we were all &s;aid to learn the
Art of building Ships from the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="334">
and <HI>French,</HI> and at this Day &s;o effectually
outbuild them all, that the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> often
buy Ships in <HI>England,</HI> and the late King of
<HI>France,</HI> the great <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. procured
the Model of our Ships from <HI>England,</HI> by
which to build his Capital Men of War;
among which that glorious Ship burnt by
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>La Hogue,</HI> called the <HI>Royal
Sun,</HI> was &s;aid to be built by the Model of
the <HI>Royal Sovereign,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of
War, built in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the
fir&s;t, and rebuilt in King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;e|cond's
Time, and the Drafts of it were it
&s;eems tran&s;mitted to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Venetians</HI> and <HI>French</HI> we
took the Art of <HI>Gla&s;s-Making,</HI> and of
<HI>Cutlery,</HI> and &s;everal others; till now we
outdo our Teachers, and export Gla&s;s
Wares, Bra&s;s Locks, Fine Keys, Knives,
Sci&s;&s;ars, Razors, Surgeons In&s;truments, and
Joyners Tools, to tho&s;e very Places; and
you may &s;ee the Doors of the Royal
Apartments at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> (as is &s;aid above)
furni&s;h'd with fine Bra&s;s Locks and nice
Hinges from <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>France</HI> can|not
produce the like.</P>
<P>I might give Examples of the like Kind
in many other Ca&s;es, wherein we excel in
the Improvement tho&s;e very People, who
&s;o much excell'd us in the Invention; of
which the Silk Manufacture is now a &s;ur|pri&s;ing
Example, in which we &s;o much out|do
the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves, who were our
<PB N="303" REF="335">
Teachers, and of whom we always bought
the riche&s;t and fine&s;t broad Silks the whole

broad Silks even into <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>TO begin with probable Improvements
in Colonies and Plantations; <HI>Columbus</HI> a
<HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> by Nation, di&s;cover'd the Coa&s;ts
of <HI>America,</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors the Adven|turers
upon tho&s;e Di&s;coveries, took Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
for the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> It is true,
they &s;pread them&s;elves upon the Continent,
reduc'd, or rather de&s;troy'd the Nations
who inhabited the &s;everal Countries, po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
the immen&s;e Wealth of the Natives,
and being led by the Hand to the Mines
of Gold and Silver, and the other rich Pro|duct
of the Place, they vouch&s;afed, as we
may &s;ay, to &s;toop and take it up; but we
can charge them with very little of Im|provement:
The Sin of Diligence cannot
be lay'd at their Door, nor have they to
this Day, after almo&s;t 200 Years peaceable
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, brought the mo&s;t fruitful and
riche&s;t Provinces and Di&s;tricts of <HI>America</HI>
to be much more productive than they
were before; not a Manufacture of any
Value erected to employ and improve the
People; not any Advantage con&s;iderable
made of the Labour of the many Thou|&s;ands
of the Natives, who &s;till remain
among them, and are as willing as able to
work for them for a Trifle; not any Cul|ture
carried on, no not in the mo&s;t fruitful
<PB N="304" REF="336">
Provinces, to encrea&s;e the Product equal to
the Strength of the Soil.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tho' plant|ing
near 100 Years after them, and taking,
as it might be called, the Fag-end of the
Di&s;covery, the northern, cold, and barren
Parts, without Silver and Gold, without
Mine or Mineral, without any apparent
Product; yet how has the improving Geni|us
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> brought Gold out of their
Dro&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;ay Dro&s;s; for &s;o it was with re&s;pect to
the fir&s;t Di&s;coverers; and in their E&s;teem all
our Colonies were but, as we may &s;ay, the
Dregs of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fir&s;t Extraction, the
Refu&s;e Part of their Conque&s;ts, their meer
Leavings, that Part of the Country which
they did not think worth &s;o much as look|ing
into.</P>
<P>WHAT were all our Colonies upon the
Continent, but a little narrow Slip of Land
upon the Sea Coa&s;ts, in the cold, wild, un|ho&s;pitable
Climates of the North? And what
our I&s;land Colonies, but a few little de&s;pi|cable
I&s;lands not worth the <HI>Spaniards</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing,
hardly worth their naming, in Compa|ri&s;on
of their va&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the Con|tinent;
nay not worth naming in Compari|&s;on
of the va&s;t I&s;lands of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;pa|niola,</HI>
one of which is bigger than all our
I&s;lands put together; and yet <HI>Cuba</HI> and
<HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> tho' equally rich and produc|tive,
and infinitely full of natural Wealth,
<PB N="305" REF="337">
are left umplanted, as not worth their Pains
to improve.</P>
<P><HI>N. B. Barbadoes</HI> is not above 70 Miles
in Circumference, and <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> is
above 400 Leagues, <HI>Nevis</HI> not above

Length.</P>
<P>BUT let us turn our Eyes now and view
the Effects of the Improving <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Genius,
the Colonies of <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI>
de&s;pis'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as well before we
di&s;cover'd them, as afterwards; for the &s;ame
<HI>Columbus,</HI> which di&s;cover'd <HI>New-Spain,</HI> di&s;|cover'd
all the Northern Coa&s;t, but left it a|gain
as not worth while to plant and po&s;&s;e&s;s
it. I &s;ay, the&s;e barren, cold, poor and uncul|tivated
Climates, the Leavings of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
How have we improved upon them
to infinite Advantages?</P>
<P>NOT di&s;couraged by the Severity of the
Cold, by the Surface over-grown with Bri|ars
and Thorns, by the early Oppo&s;ition of
the Natives, a Race of People fierce and
fal&s;e, untractable, treacherous, irreconcil|able,
bloody and mercile&s;s, even to the mo&s;t
horrible, and almo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible Cruelties,
who would rarely make Peace, and more
rarely keep their Agreements when made.</P>
<P>OFTEN ma&s;&s;acred and butcher'd, and
&s;ometimes quite driven away by the Fury
of the Savages, often &s;tarv'd out and fumi&s;h|ed,
and either the whole Body of Planters
wa&s;ted, and peri&s;hing with Cold and Want,
<PB N="306" REF="338">
and as often being reduc'd to Extremities,
forc'd to abandon the Country in the utmo&s;t
Di&s;tre&s;s, and return &s;tarving home.</P>
<P>BUT never to be di&s;couraged, how have
they by the meer Force of indefatigable Ap|plication,
planted, inhabited, cultivated
tho&s;e inho&s;pitable Climates, tho&s;e &s;uppos'd
barren Countries, tho&s;e trifling little Spots
of I&s;lands, not thought worth looking at
by the <HI>Spaniards?</HI> How have they brought
them to be the riche&s;t, the mo&s;t improved,
and the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Colonies in all that
Part of the World? So populous, &s;o fortify'd,
the People &s;o rich, the Product &s;o great;
and which is more than all, &s;o adapted to
Commerce, &s;o univer&s;ally embarked in
Trade, that it is at this Time an unre&s;olved
Doubt, whether brings the greate&s;t Wealth
to <HI>Europe,</HI> take the Exportations and Con|&s;umptions
of Manufacture there into the
Account of the Return, the Sugars, Tobacco,
and other rich Productions of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
and <HI>French</HI> Colonies; the Fi&s;h, the Corn,
the Fle&s;h, the Furrs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;ay, Which are
the greate&s;t in Value, the&s;e, or the Gold and
Silver of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru?</HI></P>
<P>BUT not to weigh the Particulars, and
come to reckon by Ounces and Drams, this
is certain, and will be granted, that the
Product of our improved Colonies rai&s;es
infinitely more Trade, employs more Hands,
and I think, I may &s;ay by Con&s;equence,
brings in more Wealth to this one particu|lar
<PB N="307" REF="339">
Nation or People, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than all
the Mines of <HI>New Spain</HI> do to the <HI>Spa|niards.</HI></P>

Gold and Silver, made to and landed in their
Country; mo&s;t of which runs out again in
the very &s;ame Species in particular Chan|nels
of Trade, to other Nations: I &s;ay, not
to in&s;i&s;t upon this, take the Opulence, the
growing Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies,
the Numbers of their People, and how pro|digiou&s;ly
every Day encrea&s;ing; and above
all, that the Encrea&s;e of Navigation, the
Number of Ships employ'd, nay Ships built,
and Seamen nurs'd up, the Wealth and Ad|dition
of Strength we reap from them, which
is not ea&s;y to calculate. I &s;ay, add this to the
Account, and, I doubt not, it will be grant|ed,
that the Return of Wealth from <HI>Ameri|ca</HI>
to this Nation, is equal to the Return of
Gold and Silver from <HI>New</HI> to <HI>Old Spain.</HI></P>
<P>LET any Man calculate the Value of our
Returns in Sugar, Ginger, Indigo, Cotton,
Cocoa, Drugs, Spice, and other Goods,
from the I&s;lands only, with the Furrs or
Peltry; the Rice, Tobacco, Train and Tur|pentine
Oil, Tar, Ma&s;ts, and abundance of
other things: Then let them add the Inter|change
of their other Product, between the
&s;everal Colonies, one with another; &s;uch as
the Supply of Corn, Pea&s;e, Rice, Meal,
Beef, Pork, Beer, Hor&s;es, Leather, Fi&s;h,
<PB N="308" REF="340">
Lumber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all which, the Quantities
are exceeding great; and in which Trade,
&s;everal Hundreds, nay &s;ome &s;ay Thou&s;ands,

<P>In Return for which, a very great Quan|tity
of Rum, Mola&s;&s;es, Cocoa, Ginger, Su|gar,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> is &s;ent back to the Main-Land Co|lonies
on the Continent; <HI>of which,</HI> all
that they cannot con&s;ume is &s;ent to <HI>Eng|land</HI>
for Returns.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e things are ca&s;t up together, in|cluding
the Con&s;umption of the Woollen
Manufacture of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and of all
the Hard-ware Manufacture; al&s;o the Cor|dage,
the Hats, Gloves, and other Leather
Manufactures: In a word, the Con&s;ump|tion
of all the other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Goods &s;ent thi|ther,
the Compari&s;on of Trade will be, out
of Que&s;tion, on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Side; &s;eeing al|mo&s;t
all the Goods exported from <HI>Spain</HI> to
their Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> are fir&s;t bought
from other Countries.</P>
<P>HAD the <HI>Spaniards</HI> been an indu&s;trious,
improving Nation, like the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the
I&s;lands of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> alone, hav|ing
been planted and improved, as our &s;mall
I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> is improved, would
have produc'd more Sugar, Cotton, Indigo,
Cocoa, Piemento, and other valuable things,
than all <HI>Europe</HI> could have con&s;umed; and
they would have been able to have &s;upply'd
all their other Colonies with Fle&s;h, &s;uch as
<PB N="309" REF="341">
Beef and Pork, and with Rice and other
things, more than they could con&s;ume.</P>
<P>IN lieu of which, tho&s;e fruitful I&s;lands
are now left to lye wa&s;te, untill'd, implant|ed,
and the great Di&s;coverers have not made
any one Step that de&s;erves the Name of
Improvement upon them, except only the
fortifying the Port of the <HI>Havana;</HI> which
Nece&s;&s;ity almo&s;t drove them to for the
Protection of their Commerce to their o|ther

of their <HI>Galleons,</HI> in their pa&s;&s;ing and re|pa&s;&s;ing
between <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREAS, take our Colonies on the
<HI>Leward</HI> I&s;lands only into Con&s;ideration,
(here indeed we have improv'd to the ut|mo&s;t)
there is hardly an Inch of Ground lo&s;t
in the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> that can produce
one Ounce of any thing more than it does;
the like perhaps cannot be &s;aid of any one
Spot of Ground in the World, which con|taining
in the whole not above 70 Miles in
Circumference, employs and maintains a|bove
100000 People, including the Negroe
Slaves, enriches the Planters to a &s;urpri&s;ing
Degree, and fully employs above 300 Sail of
Ships and Sloops, always running with Pro|vi&s;ions
of Fi&s;h, Fie&s;h, Corn, and Cattle,
from <HI>North America,</HI> Wine from the <HI>Ma|deras,</HI>
and with Slaves (Negroes) from the

and Merchant-Goods from <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="342">
THE &s;ame, in its Proportion, might be
&s;aid of the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> were the Di&s;coverers, that is, in
the room of the Inventors, and made little
or nothing of it, and we are the Improvers;
and what that Improvement is, we all know:
That I&s;land for its Planting, and its other Ad|vances
of Trade, is at this Time the great|e&s;t
Article in all our <HI>We&s;t India</HI> Commerce;
and if &s;ome nice Calculators may be allowed
to judge right, the Product of the I&s;land of
<HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the Con&s;umption of Goods
there from <HI>England,</HI> or which goes that
Way, to <HI>New Spain,</HI> makes the Trade of the
I&s;land &s;uperior at this Time to the Trade
of all our other I&s;lands; that is to &s;ay, the
I&s;lands of <HI>Barbadoes, Nevis, Antegoa, Mount|&s;erat,</HI>
and <HI>St. Chri&s;tophers,</HI> put together,
and this Trade every Day encrea&s;ing too.</P>
<P>NOR is the Improvement of <HI>Jamaica</HI> im|properly
call'd advancing upon the Inven|tion
of others; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did for
them&s;elves make &s;everal Experiments in
Trade; they planted originally in <HI>Jamaica</HI>
&s;everal things, which were then meer Inven|tions
in Planting, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have
&s;ince improved upon, and which are not to
be produc'd in any of the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
I&s;lands; &s;uch as the <HI>Cocoa, Piemento, Indi|go,</HI>
and &s;everal other things which the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
have &s;ince brought to a great Perfection
by their Improvement.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="343">
THEY likewi&s;e laid the Foundation of that
&s;ecret Commerce with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colonies,
which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have improv'd to &s;uch a
Degree, as it is even threatning to the whole
Trade of <HI>New Spain;</HI> for when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
conquer'd the I&s;land from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
tho&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Families, which remain'd upon

with their Friends and former Acquaintan|ces
in <HI>Cartagena,</HI> St. <HI>Martha,</HI> and the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Caracas,</HI> and all the other Ports of
that Country, that Intimacy became the
Foundation of an advantageous Corre&s;pon|dence,
&s;ince carry'd on; and the improving
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> brought forth from it a Trade
grown up by Time, and the particular En|couragements
of &s;ucceeding Ages, to a pro|digious
Magnitude.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e are things behind us, and may
perhaps be call'd, <HI>looking back to what is
pa&s;t;</HI> whereas the Eyes of Mankind are ra|ther
fix'd upon things before them; and
where we talk of Inventing and Improving,
the Enquiry is, what Inventions are now
upon the Anvil, for our improving Genius
to work upon? What is there that at pre|&s;ent
offers for the Application of an inge|nious
People? And this brings me to the
grand Head propo&s;ed in this Treati&s;e, (<HI>viz</HI>)
Schemes of Improvement in Commerce,
which are to be the Subject of this latter
Part of the Work.</P>

<P>IN &s;peaking of <HI>Africa,</HI> as it once was the
the Seat of Commerce for the whole
World, we mu&s;t look back as far as to the
flouri&s;hing State of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Go|vernment;
but it &s;hall be as &s;hort as can
be de&s;ired..</P>
<P>IT is true, as has been ob&s;erved by a well
informed Writer on this Subject, that the
<HI>Romans</HI> (like the <HI>Turks</HI> in our Time)
were no Friends to Trade; they carry'd on
their War for Glory; like meer Soldiers
they fought to conquer, and conquer'd to
plunder, not to plant and people the World:
So far were they from encouraging or
improving the Commerce and Wealth of
the Nations they &s;ubdued, that they over|threw
and de&s;troy'd the greate&s;t Trading
Cities in the World; &s;uch as <HI>Corinth, Syra|cu&s;e,
<PB N="313" REF="345">
Carthage,</HI> and all the Cities of <HI>Aegypt</HI>
and <HI>Africa:</HI> In&s;tead of encouraging Trade
and Navigation, they murther'd the Mer|chants,
burnt their Ships, and carry'd away
the People, which are the Life and Support
of Manufacture and Trade.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI>
as they had the riche&s;t Soil and a numerous
People, (for <HI>Africa</HI> was then infinitely popu|lous)
they improved the fir&s;t, and employ'd
the la&s;t, to the utmo&s;t; their People were as
rich as they were numerous, they carry'd
on Trade to all the Parts of the World,
planted Colonies, built Cities Abroad, and
Ships at Home; and wherever they came,
whether by Conque&s;t, or by Con&s;ent, they
planted the Country, not de&s;troy'd it, car|ry'd
People to it, not away from it; and,
in a word, made them rich, not plunder'd
and &s;tarv'd them.</P>
<P><HI>Carthage</HI> and <HI>Corinth</HI> at that Time were
the two great Emporiums of the World;
<HI>this</HI> carry'd on all the Commerce of the <HI>We&s;t</HI>

Commerce of <HI>A&s;ia, Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> and
brought the Wealth of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> the
Spices, the Silks, the Callicoes, the Gold,
the Diamonds, and in a word, the whole
<HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Trade in Caravans;
Part from <HI>Ormus</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> and <HI>Bagdat,</HI> by Water, and thence

<P><HI>Carthage,</HI> on the other hand, planted Co|lonies,
and extended their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions upon
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> as well within as with|out
the <HI>Straits;</HI> built Cities from <HI>New

the <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> on the We&s;t Side of <HI>Afri|ca,</HI>

which, there is no room to doubt, was di&s;co|vered

Enemies of all Improvement, Commerce,

<HI>Carthage,</HI> not the City only, but the very
Nation, as not to leave them a Name under
Heaven; and &s;o of cour&s;e caus'd all their re|mote&s;t

long a Digre&s;&s;ion for this Place.</P>
<P>NOW, when the&s;e two Cities of <HI>Corinth</HI>

that Side of the Ocean from the <HI>Straits
Mouth</HI> to <HI>Cape None;</HI> for as the <HI>Cartha|ginians</HI>
planted Colonies for Trade, the
Trade being lo&s;t by the Overthrow of the
Merchants in the Mother City <HI>Carthage,</HI>
the new planted Cities, and the Sea Ports,
were ruined of cour&s;e, and peri&s;hed, as a
Child &s;tarves when the Nur&s;e is taken
from it.</P>
<P>IT is true, the City of <HI>Carthage</HI> was re|built,
and recover'd it &s;elf <HI>in &s;ome Degree,</HI>
under the Government of the We&s;tern Em|perors;
and e&s;pecially as tho&s;e Emperors
were Chri&s;tians, and were Encouragers of
the Indu&s;try and Application of their Sub|jects;
then, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> the trading Genius reviv'd
very much, e&s;pecially in <HI>Africa,</HI> and the
Climate and Soil of that Country being par|ticularly
productive of many valuable things,
and tho&s;e things adapted to Trade, and en|couraging
to the Merchant, the <HI>African</HI>
Merchants carry'd on a very con&s;iderable Bu|&s;ine&s;s;
Navigation al&s;o being very much their
Peculiar, they traded by Sea to all the known
<PB N="316" REF="348">
Parts of the World, but nothing like what
they did before.</P>
<P>THE principal Branches of their Com|merce
in tho&s;e Times, as we gather from
the Hi&s;tories of the neighbouring Coun|tries,
con&s;i&s;ted, <HI>1&s;t.</HI> in exporting the Growth
of their Country, and the Manufacture of
their People, ju&s;t as it is with us in <HI>Britain:</HI>
For the Nature of Commerce is ever and
every where the &s;ame. And <HI>2dly,</HI> in im|porting
again the Product of other Coun|tries,
either for their own Con&s;umption, or
for Re-exportation to remoter Parts, which
had not the &s;ame Product.</P>
<P>THEIR own Product con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in
Corn and Cattle, and among the la&s;t, chiefly
Hor&s;es, of which they furni&s;hed great Num|bers
to mount the <HI>Roman</HI> Cavalry; for the
<HI>Numidian Hor&s;e</HI> were then, as the <HI>Barbs</HI>
and <HI>Jennets</HI> (which are the &s;ame) are now,
fam'd for their Beauty, Swiftne&s;s, and fine
Shapes, thro' all the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But above all their Product, the mo&s;t va|luable
were their Wax and Copper, in both
which they &s;till excel the whole World; al|&s;o
their Corn, Fruit, Druggs, and rich
Gums, all which remain to them.</P>
<P>FOR Manufactures, we do not indeed
read of their Woollen Manufactures, or at
lea&s;t, not much: But the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> as
well as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> (and both were <HI>Afri|cans</HI>)
are fam'd for the Product of fine Lin|en;
and 'tis to be &s;uppo&s;ed the Soil produc'd
<PB N="317" REF="349">
a very fine kind of Flax, which, as the Fund
of that Manufacture, they improved to
great Advantage; but that Part is now
lo&s;t.</P>
<P>AS to their Importations, we are a&s;&s;ur'd
they fetch'd Tin and Lead from <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI>
Gold and Wine from <HI>Spain,</HI> for old
<HI>Spain</HI> ever produc'd much Gold; Silks and
fine <HI>Ea&s;t India Goods</HI> from <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>A|lexandria;</HI>
what Trade they had with
<HI>Gaul (France</HI>) we do not find, but the
other was very con&s;iderable, and is &s;ufficient
to our Purpo&s;e. Thus &s;tood their Condi|tion
flouri&s;hing in Wealth and Commerce,
when the <HI>Romans,</HI> as above, to the eternal
Infamy, not Glory, of their very Name,
de&s;troy'd them all.</P>
<P>AS by that general Rule, I &s;ay, the Trade
of the World receiv'd a mortal Wound; &s;o
when I &s;ay they reviv'd under the <HI>Roman</HI>
and <HI>Grecian</HI> Emperors, it was apparent all
their Recovery and Encrea&s;e was owing to
their Commerce; that alone re&s;tor'd them,
and enrich'd them; and they were in <HI>Ju&s;ti|nian</HI>'s
Time the mo&s;t valuable Branch of
the We&s;tern Empire, with re&s;pect to the
Taxes they paid, and the many Regiments,
or rather Legions, they rai&s;ed, for recruiting
the <HI>Roman</HI> Armies under <HI>Beli&s;ari$s</HI> and
other Generals; and this continued long af|terwards,
even in the mo&s;t declining Times
of the We&s;tern Empire.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="350">
BUT this ri&s;ing Wealth of <HI>Africa</HI> was
too rich a Bait for the Times; the Deluge
of barbarous Nations, which overthrew the
<HI>Roman</HI> Empire, broke in upon them al&s;o;
and the <HI>Vandals,</HI> over-running <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;pread
them&s;elves into <HI>Africa,</HI> wa&s;ted and over-run
the fruitful Plains, and de&s;troy'd and
overturned the populous Cities; and in a
word, Trade &s;unk a &s;econd Time, under
the un&s;upportable Burden of War, the
<HI>Vandals,</HI> over-running all, ruin'd and po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
the Country.</P>
<P>AS the <HI>Vandals</HI> came in over the Bellies
of the native Inhabitants, &s;o &s;ome Ages af|ter
them the <HI>Saracens; Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Ma|homitans,</HI>
came in over the Heads of the
<HI>Vandals.</HI></P>
<P>WITH the&s;e, not the old <HI>Africans</HI> only
were rooted out; not only Religion, but at
la&s;t Trade too, &s;unk quite out of the Coun|try;
for, as the Followers of <HI>Mahomet</HI> are,
wherever they come, like the <HI>Romans,</HI> the
De&s;troyers both of Commerce and Cultiva|tion,
&s;o it was here.</P>
<P>TRADE and Improvement being thus, I
&s;ay, as it were rooted out in <HI>Africa,</HI> the
Moors &s;pread them&s;elves, by a rapid and ir|re&s;i&s;tible
Torrent, over all <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Por|tugal,</HI>
carrying all before them, and keeping
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it almo&s;t the Space of 800
Years; and as for <HI>Africa,</HI> they have by a
&s;trong Hand kept Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion there ever &s;ince:</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="351">
<HI>To bring all this to the ca&s;e in hand,</HI> The&s;e
<HI>Mahometans,</HI> as I have &s;aid of the <HI>Turks,</HI>
have very little Inclination to Trade, they
have no Gu&s;t to it, no Ta&s;te of it, or of the
Advantages of it; but dwelling on the Sea-coa&s;t,
and being a rapacious, cruel, violent,
and tyrannical People, void of all Indu&s;try
or Application, neglecting all Culture and
Improvement, it made them Thieves and
Robbers, as naturally as Idlene&s;s makes Beg|gars:
They di&s;dain'd all Indu&s;try and La|bour;
but being bred up to Rapine and
Spoil, when they were no longer able to
ravage and plunder the fruitful Plains of
<HI>Valentia, Granada</HI> and <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> they fell
to roving upon the Sea; they built Ships, or
rather, took Ships from others, and ravag'd
the Coa&s;ts, landing in the Night, &s;urpri&s;ing
and carrying away the poor Country Peo|ple
out of their Beds into Slavery.</P>
<P>THIS was their fir&s;t Trade, and this na|turally
made Pyrates of them; for, not be|ing
content with landing and plundering
the Sea-coa&s;t of <HI>Spain;</HI> they by Degrees be|ing
grown powerful and rich, made bold
and audacious by their Succe&s;s, they arm'd
their Ships, and began to attack fir&s;t the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> upon the high Seas, and then
all the Chri&s;tian Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> where|ever
they could find them. And thus
this wicked Trade of Roving and Robbing
began.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="352">
WHAT Magnitude they are &s;ince that
arriv'd to, what Mi&s;chiefs they have brought

are erected into States and Governments,

World free from the Terror of &s;uch Barba|rians,
he undertook &s;ingly, and without

<P>IN this War had he been join'd by the
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns;

<P>MY Propo&s;al upon this Subject con&s;i&s;ts
of two Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THE Nece&s;&s;ity there &s;eems to be
upon all the Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> e&s;pecially
the Marine Powers, to free them&s;elves from
<PB N="322" REF="354">
the In&s;olence of the&s;e Rovers, that &s;o their
Subjects may be protected in their Per|&s;ons
and Goods from the Hands of Ra|pine
and Violence, their Coa&s;ts &s;ecured
from In&s;ults and De&s;cents, and their Ships
from Capture on the Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THAT this cannot be done ef|fectually,
but by rooting out tho&s;e Ne&s;ts of
Robbers on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and at
lea&s;t driving them from the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
any of the Towns, Ports and Harbours, &s;o
as that they may have no more Ships to
appear upon the Seas.</P>

Corn in abundance, and Cattle, with &s;everal
Fruits and other Productions, fitted not
for the U&s;e of the Inhabitants only, but for
Merchandize, and in Quantities al&s;o &s;uffici|ent

tho&s;e Settlements, as well again&s;t their Chri|&s;tian
Neighbours by Sea, as their Savage
Neighbours on Land.</P>
<P>THE Trade carried on here, whether by
the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or other European Nations,
con&s;i&s;ts in but three capital Articles, viz.
<HI>Slaves, Teeth,</HI> and <HI>Gold;</HI> a very gainful
and advantageous Commerce, e&s;pecially as
it was once carried on, when the&s;e were all
purchas'd at low Rates from the Savages;
and even tho&s;e low Rates paid in Trifles, and
Toys, &s;uch as Knives and Si&s;&s;ars, Kettles and
Clouts, Gla&s;s Beads, and Cowries, Things
of the &s;malle&s;t Value, and as we may &s;ay
next to nothing; but even this Part of the
Trade is abated in its Goodne&s;s, &s;ince by
the Strife and Envy among the Traders,
we have had the Folly to in&s;truct the Sa|vages
in the Value of their own Goods, and
inform them of the Cheapne&s;s of our own;
endeavouring to &s;upplant one another, by
under&s;elling and overbidding, by which we
have taught the Negroes to &s;upplant both,
by holding up the Price of their own Pro|ductions,
and running down the Rates of
what we carry them for Sale.</P>
<P>THUS that gainful Commerce once &s;upe|rior
to all the Trades in the World, which
carried out the meane&s;t of all Exportations,
and brought home the riche&s;t, is &s;inking
<PB N="330" REF="362">
dayly into a Kind of Rubbi&s;h as to Trade;
and we are &s;ometimes &s;aid to buy even
the Gold too dear.</P>
<P>BUT all this while here is not the lea&s;t
U&s;e made of the Land; the fruitful Soil lies
wa&s;te, a va&s;t extended Country, plea&s;ant
Vallies, the Banks of charming Rivers, &s;pa|cious
Plains, capable of Improvement and
Cultivation, to infinite Advantage, lie
wa&s;te and untouch'd, over-run with Shrub|age
and u&s;ele&s;s Trees; as a Forre&s;t trod un|der
Foot with wild Creatures; and the yet
wilder Negroes, who ju&s;t plant their Maize,
and a few Roots and Herbs, like as we do
for our Garden-&s;tuff, and all the re&s;t is
left naked, and thrown up to the Wil|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>NOW, why is all this wa&s;te? What mean
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and other
diligent Nations, to neglect &s;uch Advanta|ges?
Why do they not enclo&s;e, fence, and
&s;et apart &s;uch Lands for Cultivation, as by
their Nature and Situation appear to be
proper for the mo&s;t advantageous Pro|ductions?</P>
<P>LET the &s;ame Climates be examin'd in
other Parts of the World, and the Soil in
tho&s;e Climates be compared with the Soil
in the &s;ame Latitudes on this Coa&s;t; and if
it is the &s;ame, or &s;o near the &s;ame, as no
vi&s;ible Difference is found in them, why
&s;hould they not produce the &s;ame Harve&s;t,
the &s;ame Plants, Fruits, Druggs; or, what|ever
<PB N="331" REF="363">
grows and is produced in one, why
&s;hould it not be planted, grow, and produce
the &s;ame in another?</P>
<P>LET us reduce this to Practice, and bring
the Latitude of Places together, with the
Productions proper to tho&s;e Places: For
Example,</P>
<P>1. THE Coffee-Berry is the natural Pro|duct
of the Earth at <HI>Mocha,</HI> on the Ea&s;tern
Bank of the Red Sea, and the South-we&s;t
Point of the <HI>Arabia Faelix,</HI> in the Latitude
of 13 to 14 Deg. there it grows, thrives, and
produces, as it were wild, and with the lea&s;t
Help of Labour imaginable; what A&s;&s;i&s;tance
of Art is added to it, is after the Fruit is
ripen'd and gather'd, <HI>viz.</HI> in the curing and
drying the Berry, and pre&s;erving them for
a Market; and that is to be done in the
&s;ame Manner in any Part of the World as
well as there.</P>
<P>THE diligent <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;eeing the Ea&s;ine&s;s of
the managing and curing the Berry, and how
that Part had no Dependence, either upon
the Earth, the Air, the Water, or any thing
el&s;e more there, than in another Place, took
the Hint, and planted the Coffee Tree in
the I&s;land of <HI>Java,</HI> near their City of <HI>Bata|via,</HI>
there it thrives, bears, and ripens eve|ry
jot as well as at <HI>Mocha;</HI> and now they
begin to leave off the Red Sea, and bring
20 to 30 Tons of Coffee, at a time, from
<HI>Batavia,</HI> in the Latitude of 5 Deg. S.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="364">
NOT content with this happy Improve|ment,
others of the &s;ame Nation have made
the like Experiment, in near the &s;ame Lati|tude,
in another Quarter of the World, and
with the like Succe&s;s; and now they begin
to bring large Quantities of Coffee from <HI>Su|rinam,</HI>
on the North Coa&s;t of South <HI>A|merica,</HI>
Lat 6 1/2 Deg.</P>
<P>WE are told likewi&s;e, tho' this, however
probable, I do not affirm, that the le&s;s in|du&s;trious
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> are planting it on the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> about the <HI>Rio de St. Fran|ci&s;co</HI>
in the Latitude of 12 Deg.</P>
<P>AND be&s;ides the&s;e, we are a&s;&s;ur'd the
<HI>French</HI> have planted it with Succe&s;s it their
Colony of <HI>Port Dauphin</HI> on the I&s;land
<HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> in Lat. 23 1/2 Deg. S.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> indeed planted it without
Succe&s;s at the Cape <HI>de Bon E&s;peranza:</HI>
The Rea&s;on is plain, the Place was too
cold, and it might as well be planted at our
Colonies of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Carolina,</HI> the
Cape lying, as we all know, in Latitude
34 Deg. 20 M. or thereabouts.</P>
<P>BUT if at <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Surinam,</HI> in La|titude
5 to 6 Deg. if at <HI>Mocha,</HI> in Latitude
14 Deg. if at <HI>Port Dauphin,</HI> in Latitude
23 1/2 Deg. why not at <HI>Seraloon</HI> under Cape
<HI>de Verd,</HI> in Latitude 13 to 15 Deg.? Why
not at Cape <HI>Coa&s;t</HI> and at <HI>Accra,</HI> in Latitude
5 to 6 Deg.? And, in a word, Why not up|on
all the Grain Coa&s;t, Tooth Coa&s;t, Gold
and Slave Coa&s;t, where we have a free Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="333" REF="365">
Strength for Protection, and Soil
for Production? But I proceed, I &s;hall
be &s;horter in the next Articles, becau&s;e the
Argument is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>2. THE <HI>Sugar Cane.</HI> Our Succe&s;s with
the Sugar Canes is well known, it is pro|duced
to an infinite Advantage in our I&s;land
Colonies of <HI>America.</HI> From <HI>St. Chri&s;to|phers</HI>
in Latitude 17 1/2 Deg. and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in
Latitude 18 Deg. to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> in Latitude
13 Deg. It is produc'd by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> in the &s;ame Latitude, South
of the Line from the Port of <HI>Phernambuquo,</HI>
in the Latitude of 9 Deg. to the Bay <HI>de
Todos los Santos,</HI> or Bay of <HI>All Saints,</HI> in
the Latitude of 13 Deg. 20 M. and it is pro|duced
by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the Continent
of North <HI>America,</HI> in the Provinces of
<HI>Guaxaca, Guatimala,</HI> &amp;c. in the Latitude
of 14 Deg. And why not then by us on
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> where we have the
Choice of the Country in the very &s;ame La|titude
from the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t</HI> in the Latitude 6,
to the Cape <HI>de Verd</HI> in the Latitude 15.</P>
<P>ADD to this the particular Advantages
which offer them&s;elves to the Planter, in
&s;uch an Attempt as this, on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Africa,</HI> which he has not, nor can have,
in any of tho&s;e Parts where the Sugar is
now planted, e&s;pecially by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> For
Example,</P>
<P>1. THE Ea&s;ine&s;s of procuring Negroe
Slaves, which would here co&s;t from 30 s. to
<PB N="334" REF="366">
50 s. or at mo&s;t 3 l. <HI>per</HI> Head; whereas they
are at this Time in <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI>
worth from 25 l. to 30 l. a Head; at the
<HI>Bra&s;ils</HI> from 30 l. to 40 l. and to the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
in the Provinces of <HI>Guaxaca, Guati|mala,</HI>
&amp;c. 50 to 60 l. <HI>Sterling per</HI> Head.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THE Difficulty of keeping the
Negroes from running away, is not &s;o
great as &s;ome imagine, &s;ince as they are
brought from di&s;tant Provinces, tho' it
be upon the &s;ame Continent, they know
nothing of their own Country; nor
do they under&s;tand the Language of
the next Negroes, any more than
they do <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and if they &s;hould
fly to the&s;e neighbouring Negroes, they
would but make Slaves of them again,
and &s;ell them to the Ships; &s;o that the
Slaves would not be apt to fly, and if
they did, the Lo&s;s would not be near
&s;o great as in <HI>Jamaica, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE Ea&s;ine&s;s of getting Provi&s;ions,
which they would be &s;o far from fetching
from <HI>Ireland</HI> or <HI>New England,</HI> as our Colo|nies
of <HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes</HI> do, and at a
very mon&s;trous rate; that they would be al|ways
able to furni&s;h them&s;elves as they do
now by the Produce of the Soil; as for Rice,
<HI>Indian</HI> Corn, or Maize, with Roots, &s;uch
as Potatoes, Par&s;neps, Carrots, Plantans,
and innumerable other Sorts, they grow
freely upon all the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="367">
3. THE Shortne&s;s of the Di&s;tance, and the
&s;afe Pa&s;&s;age between <HI>England</HI> and the&s;e Co|lonies,
is &s;uch, that the Voyage is often per|form'd
in 12 or 15 Days; whereas &s;ix to ten
Weeks is counted no bad Voyage between
<HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>London:</HI> The Expence as well
as other Inconveniences of which are ex|ceeding
great, and the Difference would give
the Sugars of <HI>Africa</HI> a great Advantage at
Market.</P>
<P>3. I come next to the Planting of <HI>Tea.</HI>
Every one that has been the length of <HI>A|moy</HI>
or <HI>Chu&s;an</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>China,</HI> knows
that the Tea is produced chiefly in the Pro|vinces
of <HI>Xantung, Nanquin</HI> and <HI>Canton,</HI>
as al&s;o in the I&s;lands of <HI>Japon</HI> or <HI>Japan,</HI>
mo&s;t of it between the Latitudes of 30
Deg. and 24 Deg. North of the Line. With
how much greater Advantage then of the
Climate, might the &s;ame Plant be produced
at <HI>Seraloon</HI> and on the Gold Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI>
the Plants being fetch'd from <HI>China,</HI> as well
as the Method of curing it; which, accor|ding
to Mynheer <HI>Nieuhoft,</HI> is not difficult.</P>
<P>I need &s;ay very little to the Advantages
of rai&s;ing &s;uch a profitable Plant &s;o near
Home; the thing explains it &s;elf; and the
Difficulty of making the Experiment, &s;eems
to me to be little or nothing. Nay, I am
told, that in the Governor's Garden at
Cape <HI>Coa&s;t</HI> Ca&s;tle, there is, or at lea&s;t was, in
the Time of the Government of Sir <HI>Dalby
Thomas,</HI> a large Plant of <HI>Tea</HI> planted, and
<PB N="336" REF="368">
that it grew and thrived to Admiration: I
confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee why it &s;hould not.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Head with one yet
more con&s;iderable than all the re&s;t; and that
is, the great Article of the Spices, &s;uch as
Nutmegs, Cloves, and Cinamon; the two
la&s;t are found in the I&s;lands of <HI>Ternate</HI> and
others adjacent in the Latitude of 2 to 4 Deg.
the <HI>Nutmegs</HI> indeed are found only at <HI>Banda</HI>
and &s;ome &s;mall I&s;lands adjoining and almo&s;t
under the Line, and &s;o it may be doubtful, ex|cept
in the &s;ame Latitude, which is farther
South than any of our Settlements in <HI>Afri|ca</HI>
go: But the Trial might be made of that
too. But as to the Clove, it is found in the
I&s;land of <HI>Borneo</HI> at <HI>Gilolo,</HI> and &s;everal other
I&s;lands, from the Latitudes of 2 to 7 Deg.
which is exactly the Climate of our Gold
Coa&s;t; likewi&s;e the Cinamon is found in
<HI>Ceylon,</HI> in the Lat of 6 to 7 Deg. and hits
punctually with this Coa&s;t; and we can &s;ee
no Rea&s;on why the &s;ame Climate on the
Shore of <HI>Africa</HI> may not by the Help of
Art produce the &s;ame Fruit.</P>
<P>I &s;um up all with ob&s;erving, That there
is no rea&s;on to doubt, but all or mo&s;t of the
Productions, either of the Ea&s;t or We&s;t
<HI>Indies,</HI> might be produced here; &s;uch as the
Cotton, Ginger, Sugar, Cocoa, Piemento, In|digo,
and &s;everal others known at <HI>Jamaica;</HI>
as al&s;o the Cochineal, the Vinelloes, and
even the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark al&s;o, if Indu&s;try and
<PB N="337" REF="369">
Application were &s;et on work to plant
them.</P>
<P>I cannot quit the Improvements which
might be made on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI>
without mentioning a great Corre&s;pondence
carried on among the &s;everal Nations in the
northern Part of that Country, which <HI>even
as it is now</HI> cau&s;es a great Commerce over
Land, taking Notice withal how wonderfully
it might be improv'd: This Trade is &s;aid to
be carried on by the Negroe Natives, upon
the great River <HI>Nigris</HI> or <HI>Niger;</HI> or as our
Seamen call it corruptly, the River <HI>Gambia,</HI>
in Conjunction with the Natives of &s;everal
Nations, upon the &s;ame River, Ea&s;t from the
Shore; and by all the&s;e together corre&s;pon|ding
with the Moors on the north Coa&s;t of
<HI>Africa,</HI> at <HI>Fez,</HI> at <HI>Morocco,</HI> at <HI>Mequine&s;s,</HI>
and other Cities, where they now carry on
a Commerce, by va&s;t Annual Caravans.
They tell us, that it is already a very great
Trade; but how would our Propo&s;al not
only encrea&s;e this Trade it &s;elf, but quite
change and alter the very people them|&s;elves,
while the North Part of the Coun|try,
(being Chri&s;tians,) the Savage Part
would be &s;oon civiliz'd, and become &s;o too,
and the People learn to live to be cloth'd,
and to be furni&s;h'd with many Things from
<HI>Europe,</HI> which they now want; and by
Con&s;equence would with their Manners
change the very Nature of their Commerce,
<PB N="338" REF="370">
and fall in upon the Con&s;umption of the
European Manufactures.</P>
<P>IT would be needle&s;s to lay out Schemes
of Commerce among the Inhabitants of the
Nations within tho&s;e &s;outhern Lands; Num|bers
of European People being but once
&s;ettled on the Sea Coa&s;t, would &s;oon &s;pread
the Commerce into the inland Nations, and
employ and enrich the Inhabitants, by in|&s;tructing
them in the Arts of living, as well
as of Trade; and this brings me to a View of
one of the greate&s;t Scenes of Improvement in
the World, which is in &s;hort this, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>THAT there needs little more than to in|&s;truct
and inure the barbarous Nations in all
our Colonies, Factories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Arts of
Living; clothing with Decency, not &s;hame|le&s;s
and naked; feeding with Humanity, and
not in a Manner brutal; dwelling in Towns
and Cities, with Oeconomy and civil Go|vernment,
and not like Savages.</P>
<P>IT is the mo&s;t unaccountable Mi&s;take of
its Kind that can be imagin'd, that one
&s;hould &s;uppo&s;e civilizing Nations do not
encrea&s;e Commerce; the Contrary is evident,
in all our Colonies: Civilizing the <HI>American</HI>
Savages, who inhabited the Countries on the
Back of the <HI>European</HI> Colonies in <HI>North
America,</HI> as well our own, as tho&s;e on the
<HI>French</HI> Side at <HI>Quebeck</HI> and <HI>Canada;</HI> what
has been the Con&s;equence? Take it in the
following Particulars, which tho' few and
&s;mall in the &s;everal Articles, are yet con&s;i|derable
<PB N="339" REF="371">
in the whole, and abundantly con|firm
the Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE Indians or Natives, before the Euro|peans
came among them, had neither Hou&s;es,
Cattle, Clothes, Tools, Weapons, Ammuni|tion,
or Hou&s;hold Stuff; their Cattle were
the Bea&s;ts of the Forre&s;t, their Clothes were
the Skins of Bea&s;ts, their Weapons Bows,
wooden Swords, Clubs, Javelins and Darts,
pointed with Teeth and Bones of Fi&s;hes,
their Ammunition Arrows and Stones, their
Hou&s;es meer Wigwams, Hovels and Huts,
their Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff Earthen Pans hardned
in the Sun, their Beds Matts and Skins laid
on the Ground; they could &s;trike no Fire,
but by rubbing two Sticks together; they
had neither edg'd Tools or other Tools, for
they had neither Iron, Steel, Bra&s;s or Lead;
no Grind &s;tone or Mill-&s;tone; their Meat
was Fle&s;h dried in the Sun, and their Drink
no other than cold Water.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Indians even tho&s;e remaining
wild and &s;avage almo&s;t as before; yet being
convinc'd by their Conveniencies, and promp|ted
by Nece&s;&s;ity, &s;erve them&s;elves of us with
an infinite Number of Things, for the abun|dant
Accommodation of Life; and tho&s;e that
are more civilized, do it more; and the&s;e al|together
encrea&s;e our Trade; <HI>for Example,</HI>
take their own Goods fir&s;t, with which they
purcha&s;e ours. They &s;ell the Dear Skins, Bear
Skins, Fox, Beaver, and other Furrs; all
<PB N="340" REF="372">
which together (as is &s;aid above) our Mer|chants
call <HI>Peltry:</HI> The&s;e I &s;ay they &s;ell to
our People, and a very good Merchandize
they are, and make a good and great Return.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e they buy our Woollen Ma|nufactures
for their Clothing, &s;uch as Duf|fels,
Blankets, Halfthicks, Ker&s;ies, and &s;uch
cour&s;e Goods; and others al&s;o of Leather,
with which they dre&s;s and keep them&s;elves
warm, in the colde&s;t Sea&s;on; al&s;o they buy
Caps, Stockings, Hats, Shoes, Gloves, for
the &s;ame hard Weather.</P>
<P>IN order to provide Fuel and Food, they
buy <HI>for the la&s;t</HI> Fire-Arms and Ammunition,
&s;uch as Powder and Shot, and <HI>for the fir&s;t,</HI>
Hatchets and Axes, Knives, Bills, as al&s;o
Spades, Shovels, Pickaxes, and other Tools
fitted for their Work: For the building and
furni&s;hing Hou&s;es to dwell in; they buy
all Kinds of edg'd Tools, as al&s;o Nails,
Spikes, Hammers, Saws, Chi&s;els, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
wrought Iron for Hooks, Hinges, Locks,
Bolts, and many other Things: For their
Hou&s;hold Stuff likewi&s;e they &s;ometimes
buy Chairs, Stools, Benches, Beds, Bed|&s;teads,
and the like; al&s;o Pots, Casks, and
other Ve&s;&s;els of Earth, Pewter, Bra&s;s and
Wood, and in a Word every Thing they
want, which either Art or Trade can &s;up|ply
them with.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e make Trade, and as the&s;e De|mands
encrea&s;e, the Trade and Commerce of
<HI>Europe</HI> mu&s;t encrea&s;e; for Encrea&s;e of the
<PB N="341" REF="373">
Civiliz'd People is an Encrea&s;e of Com|merce
in the Main, let the Degree of
their Demands be more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>WHAT then have the People of <HI>England</HI>
more to do, but to encrea&s;e the Colonies of
their own Nation in all the remote Parts,
where it is proper and practicable, and
to civilize and in&s;truct the Savages and Na|tives
of tho&s;e Countries, wherever they
plant, &s;o as to bring them by the &s;ofte&s;t
and gentle&s;t Methods to fall into the
Cu&s;toms and U&s;age of their own Country,
and incorporate among our People as one
Nation.</P>
<P>I &s;ay nothing of chri&s;tianizing the Sa|vages,
'tis remote from my pre&s;ent Pur|po&s;e;
and I doubt much more remote from
our practice, at lea&s;t in mo&s;t Places; but I
&s;peak of an Incorporation of Cu&s;toms and
U&s;ages, as may in Time bring them to live
like Chri&s;tians, whether they may turn
Chri&s;tians or no.</P>
<P>TO bring this Home to the Coa&s;t and
Country of <HI>Africa,</HI> of which I was but
ju&s;t now &s;peaking; let them calculate the
Improvements propo&s;ed in Bu&s;ine&s;s, in Plan|ting,
Fi&s;hing, Shipping, and all the nece&s;|&s;ary
Employments that would attend a
publick improv'd Colony; and let them
tell me, if the Con&s;equence would not be
a Con&s;umption of Manufacture, among a
People where there was none before, and in a
<PB N="342" REF="374">
Place where we had no Commerce to carry
on before.</P>
<P>NOR let any weak-headed Chri&s;tian &s;ug|ge&s;t,
that this would be to anticipate our
We&s;t India Trade, &s;upplant our other Co|lonies,
and weaken us on one Hand, while
it &s;trengthens us on another; let tho&s;e who
talk &s;o, con&s;ider, <HI>1&s;t</HI> the great Improve|ments
propo&s;ed, without meddling either
with Sugar, Ginger, or any of our I&s;land
Productions, and how great the Improve|ment
might be fir&s;t made in the&s;e Things.
And, <HI>2dly,</HI> Let me add, that as it is evident
all our I&s;land Colonies are not at this Time
&s;ufficient to &s;upply our Markets with Su|gar,
including the Quantity demanded for
Exportation, the Quantity cannot ea&s;ily be
too great; nor indeed is there any Danger
of it; &s;o that tho&s;e phlegmatick Objecti|ons
are ea&s;ily to be an&s;wered, and need take
up no Room here: Let us &s;ee the Improve|ment
begun, and let us &s;ee the Danger be|gun,
of overcharging our Markets, and hur|ting
the Trade of our I&s;lands, and let us
hear if the I&s;lands complain; it is then Time
enough to an&s;wer tho&s;e Scruples, at pre&s;ent
I mu&s;t acknowledge they merit no Con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, there is a va&s;t Ocean

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being a PROPOSAL for an Encrea&s;e and
Improvement of the Briti&s;h Commerce on
the Ea&s;t Coa&s;t of Africa.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is but one con&s;iderable Coun|try
in the World that we have any
Knowledge of upon the Surface of the Globe,
to which the Inhabitants of <HI>Europe</HI> have no
Commerce, or with whom they have no
manner of Conver&s;e: And this is the great
Empire or Cla&s;s of Kingdoms call'd <HI>Ethio|pia</HI>
or the <HI>Ahy&s;&s;ines.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="376">
THERE are but three Ways for us to come
at any Part of this Country in a Cour&s;e of
Trade or Corre&s;pondence, and at pre&s;ent
they are all made impracticable.</P>
<P>1. OVER Land from <HI>Tripoli</HI> and the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Barcan;</HI> and were the <HI>Tripolins</HI>
reduced, according to the Tenour of our
fir&s;t Propo&s;al, for rooting out tho&s;e Ene|mies
of fair Trade, the Rovers of <HI>Barbary,</HI>
this Trade would certainly be &s;et on foot by
Caravans, as is done in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> from <HI>Aleppo</HI>
to <HI>Bagdat,</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>2. UP the <HI>Nile</HI> from <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> into
the Lake of <HI>Dombea:</HI> But tho' this is &s;aid
to be in U&s;e at &s;ome certain Times when
the River is not &s;well'd beyond its Bounds
and Banks; yet tho&s;e that have examin'd it
more nicely, tell us, that tho&s;e People are
mi&s;taken, and that the Cataracts or Water-Falls,
which are frequent in the River, from
within 160 Miles of <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> South, cut
off all Po&s;&s;ibility of a Navigation, or of any
Commerce by Water farther that Way.</P>
<P>3. THE third Way is by the Coa&s;t of the
<HI>Red Sea;</HI> and this al&s;o is cut off, by the
<HI>Turks,</HI> who have &s;eized upon all the We&s;t|ern
Shores of the <HI>Gulph</HI> or <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and
driving the <HI>Aethiopians</HI> from the Coa&s;t,
have either &s;hut all the Nations of the
World out from the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> or have
&s;hut up the <HI>Aethiopians</HI> from conver&s;ing
with the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="377">
THE Commerce however is apparently
practicable from the Coa&s;t of that <HI>Gulph,</HI>
farther South than the <HI>Turks</HI> have yet po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
it; and there are two particular Rivers
on that Coa&s;t, <HI>viz. Zeila</HI> and the <HI>Houache,</HI>
which I am a&s;&s;ur'd, as well as I can be of
things which we have &s;o little Intelligence
of, are navigable far in within the Country,
and beyond the Coa&s;t, which the <HI>Turks</HI> are
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of; and that by the&s;e Rivers, a
Commerce may be e&s;tabli&s;hed into the very
Centre of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> which is indeed the
riche&s;t and the mo&s;t populous Part of it, and
that the Mouths of tho&s;e Rivers are open
for any Nation to &s;ettle and fortify at;
which Settlements would be ea&s;ily defend|ed,
by having but two Ships of Force,
from 40 to 50 Guns, always there, by whom
al&s;o going and returning, the Trade would
be carry'd on round the Cape.</P>
<P>It may be &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;uch a Trade
would be within the Circle of the <HI>Ea&s;t In|dia</HI>
Company's Charter; to which it would
be effectually an&s;wer'd, Why then does not
the Company open the Trade, and make a
Settlement them&s;elves? If they do not, no ex|clu&s;ive
Privilege of Commerce is granted to
any Men, or Company of Men, to damn
or de&s;troy a Trade, but to improve and
carry it on; and if they in&s;i&s;t on their Char|ter
to have the Right of Trading to <HI>Aethio|pia,</HI>
but will not trade, their Right is &s;o far
void of cour&s;e; otherwi&s;e they may as well

tell us, they have a Charter granted them,
to &s;hut out the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
from the <HI>Aethioprian</HI> Trade, which would
be ab&s;urd, and contrary to the Nature of
the Thing.</P>
<P>I need &s;ay no more to this Part, as to its
being practicable; I &s;hall at any Time mark
out the Way, how to put it in Practice, and
to open the Commerce, and prove that the
<HI>Aethiopeans</HI> have, on many Occa&s;ions, &s;hewed
them&s;elves willing to embrace &s;uch a Pro|po&s;al;
it remains only, to &s;hew a little
Sketch of the Trade it &s;elf, and the Im|provement
which it might be to the Com|merce
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>1. CONTRARY to the whole Tenor of
our Corre&s;pondence in the <HI>Indies,</HI> this
Trade would be exceeding much to the Ad|vantage
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> becau&s;e they
would both receive our Growth and Pro|duce,
and make to us Returns in <HI>Specie;</HI>
whereas, in all the Trade of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Chi|na</HI>
our Ca&s;e is the rever&s;e; for there we
cannot fell our own Goods at all, and cannot
buy theirs, but with ready Money. They
will take off none or but few of our Manu|factures,
nor will they &s;upply us with theirs,
but for hard Silver; to the exhau&s;ting, not
of <HI>England</HI> only, but even of all <HI>Europe,</HI>
of their ready Money.</P>
<P>2. The People, tho' the Country is hot, go
all mode&s;tly and decently cloathed; and 'tis
known by tho&s;e who have travell'd among
<PB N="347" REF="381">
them, that they would buy our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fine
Cloths In particular, &s;uch as are carry'd to
<HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> if they could come at
them; and &s;ome E&s;&s;ays of that Kind have
been made from <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> by Land, tho'
not &s;uch as are con&s;iderable enough to be
called a Trade.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, &s;uch a Trade would
be infinitely advantageous; &s;eeing, the Re|turn
for whatever of our Manufactures could
be &s;old there, would be in Gold, in Ivo|ry,
Sulphur, Civet, Salt-Peter, Emralds,
and &s;uch like valuable Goods: There are o|ther
Productions, which we have &s;een from
thence al&s;o, as Deer Skins in exceeding great
Quantities; Hides of black Cattle; Leo|pards
and Lions Skins, and others of tho&s;e
Kinds; al&s;o fine Copper, and &s;ome very
rich Gums and Drugs, of which I cannot
give the Names, except Frankincen&s;e, Gum-Arab.
and <HI>Aloes Socotrina.</HI> I have been
told of many others, but without Certainty
enough to affirm it.</P>
<P>IN Exchange for the&s;e, we &s;hould
without Fail introduce our broad Cloths,
fine Scarlet Shalloons, Sayes, Serges, and
&s;uch other thin Stuffs as are u&s;ually worn in
hot Climates; be&s;ides a great Quantity of
hard Ware Manufactures, wrought Iron
and Bra&s;s, edged Tools, Weapons, Fire-Arms,
Ammunition, Lead, Pewter, Tin,
line Linen, and perhaps Silks al&s;o; for
we are well a&s;&s;ur'd they have no more Trade
<PB N="348" REF="382">
with <HI>India</HI> or any other Parts of the World
than they have with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THUS you have three great Articles for
the Improvement of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> only, all practicable,
and all capable of rai&s;ing an immen&s;e Con|&s;umption
of our Woollen Manufactures,
where there was little or no Con&s;umption
for them before: One of which Articles,
<HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Guinea,</HI> is actually in our own
Power, and &s;o little to be &s;aid again&s;t the
Experiment, that nothing of its Kind is
more wonderful, than that it has never
yet been propos'd to the World, and the
Attempt not made.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being a PROPOSAL for turning the whole
Trade for Naval Stores, Timber, Deals,
&amp;c. from the Ea&s;t Country, and from
Norway and Sweden, to our own Colo|nies,
and yet without putting the Go|vernment
of England to the dead Charge
of Bounty-Money on that Importation.</HEAD>
<P>A Fourth Improvement of Commerce
lyes al&s;o within our own Reach, and
&s;ome dull and weak, unperforming Steps
have been made, which looked as if we knew
<PB N="349" REF="383">
the Advantage of it; but I &s;ay, in &s;o phleg|matick
a Manner, as if, like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Slug|gard,
<HI>we would not pluck our Hands out of
our Bo&s;om to put them to our Mouths.</HI>
This is the transferring our Demand of Na|val
Stores, Timber, Deals, Ma&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from
<HI>Norway, Sweden,</HI> and the Ea&s;t Country,
to our own Colonies in <HI>America;</HI> Coun|tries,
without Exception, as able effectually
to &s;upply us with Hemp, Flax, Tar,
Turpentine, all Kinds of Fir, Timber,
Deals, Pipe and Hog&s;head Staves, and per|haps,
in Time, with Iron al&s;o, as all the
Nations mention'd above, and with proper
Encouragements, would &s;oon produce them
all as cheap.</P>
<P>SEVERAL Attempts have, as I have
noted above, been made at this, as if we
own'd the Pro&s;pect of Advantage, but knew
not how to bring it to bear; all that has
hitherto been offer'd for the Encouragement
of this Commerce, and to make it practica|ble,
has been that of a Bounty, to be paid in
<HI>England,</HI> upon the Importation, &s;o to encou|rage
the Merchant: But, with Submi&s;&s;ion,
this is not &s;ufficient to make a Trade of it,
and is but upon one Species of the Goods
neither; whereas, the Encouragement mu&s;t
be univer&s;al, if you expect the Trade &s;hall
be &s;o.</P>
<P>BEFORE I proceed upon this important
Article, which &s;eems to have great Difficul|ties
in it; which Difficulties yet I profe&s;s
<PB N="350" REF="384">
to remove, I mu&s;t lay down one Founda|tion;
which neverthele&s;s, tho' I think 'tis
undoubted, yet we do take upon the Cre|dit
of the Inhabitants of <HI>New England,</HI>
and the other Colonies on the North of
<HI>America;</HI> if they deceive us, they only
therein deceive them&s;elves, and we are
where we were.</P>
<P>The fundamental is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That
they are able to furni&s;h a &s;ufficient Quanti|ty
of Hemp, Flax, Tar, Turpentine, Fir,
Timber, Deal Boards, Ma&s;ts, Yards, Pipes,
and Hog&s;head-Staves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fully to &s;upply
the whole Demand of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;o as that we &s;hould &s;uffer no
Scarcity, or want of tho&s;e Goods, tho' we
&s;hould ab&s;olutely prohibit their Importati|on
from any other Place.</P>
<P>BY being able to furni&s;h, I am to be un|der&s;tood
thus; for I mu&s;t not &s;peak more
for them, than they &s;peak for them&s;elves;
and it is meet we &s;hould be very exact in
tho&s;e Things we call fir&s;t Principles: I &s;ay,
I am to be under&s;tood not that they have
Hands enough at pre&s;ent to fell and cut
out the Quantities of Timber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> draw
and extract the Tar and Turpentine, &s;plit
out the Staves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for that, I believe, at
fir&s;t, would be a Difficulty, tho' it would
&s;oon be ma&s;ter'd; but that the Country,
and the Woods, have a &s;ufficient Quantity
of all the&s;e; that they are not to be plant|ed,
or waited for till grown; but that they
<PB N="351" REF="385">
have a boundle&s;s Extent of Woods, as well
on the Hills as on the Plains, unexhau&s;ted,
and indeed, unexhau&s;tible; which are &s;uffi|cient
for all our Demands, and much more.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE, I do not &s;ay, or in&s;i&s;t, that
they do now produce or plant a &s;ufficient
Quantity of Hemp and Flax to &s;upply our
Demand; but that they have Land enough,
&s;ufficient in Strength of Soil, and &s;ufficient
in Quantity, and which by cutting down
the Woods, would daily encrea&s;e: This I
think is undoubted.</P>
<P>N. B. THE Countries where this Sup|ply
of Timber and Naval-Stores would
be produced, is, in a Word, the whole
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Part of the Continent of
<HI>North-America,</HI> viz. <HI>New-England,
New-York, Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Jer&s;ey, Pen|&s;ylvania,</HI>
and all the Country, whe|ther
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd or no, upon the great
River of <HI>Delaware,</HI> as far as that
River is navigable, which may be for
ought we know 100 Miles beyond
<HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>ALL the Colonies of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI>
to the bottom of the Bay
of <HI>Che&s;eapeake,</HI> all the Colonies of
<HI>North</HI> and <HI>South Carolina,</HI> and all the
Rivers thereof; in which la&s;t Colony
alone, they tell us, there is as much
Fir-Timber growing, as in all the King|dom
of <HI>Norway.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="386">
LIKEWISE it is to be added, that <HI>muta|tis
mutandis,</HI> the Coin, and Value of Pay|ment
con&s;ider'd, they will be able to furni&s;h
all the&s;e Things as cheap as the Ea&s;t Coun|try
and <HI>Norway</HI> Trade does now furni&s;h
them.</P>
<P>THESE Things granted, the Propo&s;al is
brought into a narrow Compa&s;s; all the
Difference then between <HI>England</HI> (the Mar|ket)
and our Colonies, the Producers of the&s;e
Goods, lies in the Price of the Freight,
occa&s;ion'd by the Di&s;tance of Place, and
Length of the Voyage; how to bring
this to a Par, is the whole of the Enqui|ry:
And this is to be done by the &s;everal
Methods following.</P>
<P>N. B. Bounties and Payments of dead
Money to the Importer for Encourage|ment,
I reject, as being a meer Charge
upon the Nation, tho' not upon the
particular Buyer of the Goods, and
is not by any Cleans to be called a
le&s;&s;ening the Di&s;parity, only it re|moves
the Burthen from private
Hands to the Publick, which is not
&s;ufficient; and &s;hould it extend to all
the Importations, would be a Burden
too heavy to bear, even for the whole
Nation.</P>
<P>THE only Weight I would lay on the
Publick, and even that but for a while, is
to take off the Duties entirely from all tho&s;e
Species of Goods, (not to repeat 'em) and
<PB N="353" REF="387">
prohibit the Importation from other Pla|ces
and not this la&s;t Part neither, till the
Colonies were fully entered into the Trade.</P>
<P>THEN for the Freight; we are to &s;up|po&s;e,
that the Freight of all the&s;e Articles,
From the Ea&s;t and North Seas, &s;tands now
at a Medium of forty to fifty Shillings <HI>per</HI>
Ton, call it more or le&s;s; and &s;uppo&s;e the
Freight of the fame Goods from the Colo|nies
&s;hould then &s;tand at a Medium of &s;ix to
eight <HI>lib. per</HI> Ton; &s;o that the Freight
would be three Times as much one way as
the other; 'tis true, this is a very con&s;idera|ble
Article; and e&s;pecially con&s;idering them
to be all bulky Goods al&s;o.</P>
<P>BUT two Articles will immediately con|tribute
towards, if not be a full Equiva|lent
to this Exce&s;s of Freight.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> TAKING off the Duty upon Im|portation
here, which being very high,
&s;uppo&s;e it, for Argument Sake, to be 20 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> may fairly be calculated at one half
of the difference, and mu&s;t be found by
the Importer in the Price of his Goods at
Market.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> LAYING an Impo&s;t, &s;uppo&s;e it
to be about ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon all the Im|portations
of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods into tho&s;e Co|lonies,
and this I in&s;i&s;t will be equal to
the other half: The Money &s;o rai&s;ed to be
paid to the Commanders of the Ships, in
&s;uch Proportions as &s;hall be adju&s;ted by the
<PB N="354" REF="388">
Publick, and upon &s;o much Tonage only, as is
Loaden upon them of &s;uch particular Goods.</P>
<P>THE Colonies will never complain of
&s;uch a Duty, becau&s;e 'tis in a manner paid
to them&s;elves, and is but taking the Mo|ney
out of one Pocket, and putting it in|to
the other; the Growth of their Country
will be exported; (indeed the wa&s;te Growth,
for they burnt it all before) their own
People will be employ'd, and will be pro|digiou&s;ly
encrea&s;ed, and the&s;e two are of
the la&s;t Importance to them; nay, they
are of &s;uch Importance to them, that give
them but an A&s;&s;urance of the&s;e, they may
give you A&s;&s;urance, that in a few Years
they will be the greate&s;t, and mo&s;t pros|perous
Colonies in the World.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, I de&s;pi&s;e (with the utmo&s;t
Contempt of their Ignorance) the Sug|ge&s;tions
of tho&s;e Times, when this glori|ous
Scheme of <HI>New-England</HI>'s Pro&s;perity
was laid a&s;ide, (about two and forty Years
ago) from a pretended Jealou&s;y of tho&s;e
Colonies growing too powerful, and ma|king
them&s;elves independent; in&s;inuating,
becau&s;e they were independent in a religi|ous
Profe&s;&s;ion, they wanted to be &s;o in Go|vernment;
whereas fir&s;t, the very Thought,
be&s;ides a wor&s;e Principle it began in, <HI>viz.</HI>
of Party Malice, was to the la&s;t Degree
weak and fooli&s;h; &s;ince 'tis evident, the
Pro&s;perity, and indeed, the very Being and
Sub&s;i&s;tence of <HI>New-England</HI> in Matters of
<PB N="355" REF="389">
Trade, con&s;i&s;ts in, and depends wholly up|on
their Union with, and Subjection to
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> as the Growth of their
Country, which is the only Article that
&s;upports their Commerce, is taken off by
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies only: Nor can any
other Nation in Europe take it off but the
<HI>Engli&s;h; and the &s;ame of the re&s;t:</HI> For
Example,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> have no I&s;lands at all, but
one (remote and &s;mall) called <HI>Curacao,</HI> able
to do nothing worth the naming. The
<HI>French</HI> indeed have <HI>Martinico,</HI> a flouri&s;hing
I&s;land Colony; but the I&s;land is large, and
produces mo&s;t of its own Provi&s;ions; and
if it did not, they have a Colony upon the
Main, <HI>viz. Canada,</HI> which &s;upplies the
<HI>French</HI> at all their I&s;lands with Provi&s;ion,
&s;uch as Meal for Bread, Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, Peas,
and all other Provi&s;ion that they can want;
and the <HI>French</HI> would never &s;tarve their
own Colony of <HI>Canada,</HI> to feed <HI>New-Eng|land.</HI>
But to make it unan&s;werable, if
the French would do their utmo&s;t, they
are not able to con&s;ume or take off, no
not one twentieth Part of the Growth of
our Colonies, who maintain, as &s;ome af|firm,
1000 Sail of Ships and Sloops, con|&s;tantly
running with tho&s;e Things from
the Main of <HI>North America</HI> to the I&s;lands,
&s;uch as St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers, Antegoa, Nevis,
Mount&s;errat, Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica;</HI>
the two la&s;t of which con&s;ume a prodigious
Quantity.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="390">
THESE Provi&s;ions are the meer Growth of
the Country, &s;uch as Flour or Meal in Bar|rels,
Peas, Malt, Rice and Tobacco; Beef
and Pork, pickled and barrelled; Sheep
and Hor&s;es alive; Beer in Casks and in
Bottles; white Fi&s;h &s;alted and dry'd and
Salmon barrel'd; be&s;ides Lumber for build|ing
and repairing, as well Hou&s;es as
Ships, and Ships and Sloops ready built and
fini&s;h'd.</P>
<P>THESE all are the Product of the Coun|try,
and the Labour of the People in the
Colonies of <HI>New England, New York,</HI>
the two <HI>Jer&s;ies, Pen&s;ilvania, Virginia</HI> and
<HI>Carolina;</HI> without this Export, tho&s;e Co|loonies
would peri&s;h. It is true, the I&s;lands
would &s;tarve for want of the Provi&s;ions
too, at lea&s;t at fir&s;t: But on the Conti|nent,
if the I&s;lands did not take off their
Product, their Lands which they have
been at a va&s;t Expence to cure, and clear,
and plant, would lie u&s;ele&s;s and unculti|vated;
the Swine which the Woods feed
for them by thou&s;ands, would overrun
them with their Multitude, and be wor&s;e
to them in Time, than the Bears and the
Wolves; their Plantations would produce
more of every Thing than their Mouths
could devour, or than they could find
Markets to vend them at; their Timber
would &s;tand indeed where it was, for no
Body would fell it to have it, and they
<PB N="357" REF="391">
might &s;et their Woods on Fire as they did
formerly, to clear the Land of them.</P>
<P>IN a Word, this being their Ca&s;e, their
Intere&s;t ties them to <HI>England,</HI> tho' their
Duty &s;hould not, and to &s;eparate from
<HI>England,</HI> would be to be undone.</P>
<P>THEN carry the fame Argument on to
the propo&s;ed Commerce, for Timber, Na|val
Stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this would &s;till the fa&s;ter,
(if that were po&s;&s;ible) bind them to their
Dependence on <HI>England,</HI> for no Nation in
Europe could give them the &s;ame En|couragement:
I cannot enlarge upon this
Article here, it is evident to all that un|der&s;tand
Trade: If Courtiers and Statesmen
are ignorant, let them enquire where they
may be inform'd.</P>
<P>I return to the Propo&s;al; having thus &s;tated
the Equivalent, by which the Government
may be reimbur&s;t what they &s;hall be out
of Pocket for the Experiment; it remains
only to give a brief Account of the Ad|vantages
of &s;uch a Commerce; take them
in a few &s;hort Heads, for I cannot enlarge
them as I ought, for want of Room.</P>
<P>1. INSTEAD of the Trade for Deals and
Timber, Tar, Ma&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which we carry
on now with <HI>Norway,</HI> almo&s;t all for ready
Money, and which carries out more Silver
in Specie, nay, in our very Coin, Crowns
and half Crowns, than the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI>
Company it &s;elf, however little Notice
has been taken of it: I &s;ay, in&s;tead of this
<PB N="358" REF="392">
di&s;advantageous Trade, we &s;hould then re|ceive
all the &s;ame Goods in Exchange for
our own Manufactures, and they would be
purcha&s;ed of, and produc'd by the La|bour
of our own People, the indu&s;trious
Planters, Subjects to the Government of his
Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>2. INSTEAD of having at lea&s;t two
Thirds of the&s;e Goods brought over in
foreign Bottoms, <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> and
the Ships navigated by foreign Seamen, to
whom we pay dead Freight in the like ready
Money, and which they carry away in Spe|cie,
as above; it would be wholly brought
to us in our own Ships, <HI>New England</HI>
built, and navigated wholly by our own
Seamen.</P>
<P>3. INSTEAD of a very few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships
which now u&s;e the Norway Trade, this
new Commerce would at lea&s;t employ a
thou&s;and Sail of Ships every Year, and all
the Year, and mo&s;t of them Ships of Bur|then:
So that be&s;ides the Benefit of build|ing,
repairing, and fitting out &s;o many
Ships, it would be a new Nur&s;ery of Sea|men
to us, having always 15 to 20000
Seamen employ'd in it.</P>
<P>4. THE Colonies would be encrea&s;ed in
People beyond expre&s;&s;ing; and con&s;equent|ly,
not only the Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions
would be encrea&s;ed there, which is, as be|fore,
the grand Fund of their Pro&s;perity;
but the Con&s;umption of Manufactures,
<PB N="359" REF="393">
and all European Exportations to them,
would be in Proportion encrea&s;ed, which
is the grand Subject of my Work. By
the Calculations which I have &s;een, it is
&s;uppo&s;ed, not le&s;s than to 100,000 Men
would be employ'd in the Woods, cutting
and felling Timber, Deals, Ma&s;ts, Yards,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the managing and planting of Hemp
and Flax; in the extracting and drawing off
the Tar; and in preparing all the Articles
mentioned, to be fetch'd from thence, on
Account of this Trade; and this, be&s;ides
Women and Children, who could not do
much in that Part; and be&s;ides, the build|ing
Ships among them, an Article &s;o con|&s;iderable,
as well de&s;erves to be handled by
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>5. IT would effectually furni&s;h tho&s;e
Colonies with Returns for <HI>England,</HI> which
they are now greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for, in or|der
to pay the Ballance of their Trade with
<HI>England;</HI> the Quantity of our Manu|factures
which they take off, infinitely ex|ceeds
what they have of their own Growth
to &s;end us in Return, whereas in Ca&s;e of
&s;uch a Trade for the Produce of their
Country, they would be at about a PAR
with us, and we &s;hould always be able to
call for as much Goods from them, as
would pay our &s;elves.</P>
<P>6. BY this Means they would receive
Silver in great Quantities from <HI>Jamaica,</HI>
and the other I&s;lands, for all that Trade
<PB N="360" REF="394">
would be clear Gain to them, and that Sil|ver
al&s;o would <HI>&s;tay with them,</HI> which now
It cannot do, all being &s;natch'd up for
Returns to <HI>England</HI> in Specie, tho' it be
at 12 <HI>s.</HI> to 14 <HI>s. per</HI> Ounce: So that in
con&s;equence of this Commerce, there
would be a Circulation of current Money
In the Colonies on the Continent, a Thing
they have of late been Strangers to.</P>
<P>IT would take up a Volume by it &s;elf,
to lay open all the glorious Schemes of
Improvement in Trade, which would be the
Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Bu&s;ine&s;s, and parti|cularly
the Encrea&s;e of our Manufacture
here, by the Demand of Goods from thence,
when the Numbers of People in tho&s;e Co|loonies
&s;hould be thus encreas'd; let any
one calculate (that is able to judge of the&s;e
Things) by what it is already, what it
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be on an Encrea&s;e of Peo|ple:
Let them ca&s;t up the Exportations to
the five Colonies on the Continent; let
them con&s;ider tho&s;e Exportations to be as
they really are, one entire Improvement,
derived from meer nothing, or next to
nothing in the la&s;t four&s;core Years, for
then it was all an Embrio, and &s;ome of
them were nor in Being as to Trade (<HI>viz.)
New York</HI> and the <HI>Jer&s;ies</HI> conquered but
in 1666 from the <HI>Dutch, Pen&s;ylvania</HI> not
above 50 Years in Growth, <HI>Carolina</HI> le&s;s.</P>
<P>LET them tell us, or bat gue&s;s at for
us, what a glorious Trade to <HI>England</HI> it
<PB N="361" REF="395">
would be to have tho&s;e Colonies encrea&s;ed
with a Million of People, to be cloth'd,
furni&s;h'd, and &s;upply'd with all their need|ful
Things, Food excepted, only from us;
and ty'd down for ever to us by that immor|tal,
indi&s;&s;oluble Bond of Trade, <HI>their In|tere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>LET them con&s;ider, that all tho&s;e People
mu&s;t fetch from <HI>Great Britain</HI> only, their
Cloths, Woollen, Linnen, Cotton, and Silk;
all their Haberda&s;hery; all their Manufac|tures
of hard Ware, wrought Iron, Bra&s;s,
Chains, Edg'd Tools, Jack-work, Nails, Bolts,
Screws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all their heavy Ware, &s;uch as
ca&s;t Iron and Bra&s;s, Guns, Mortars, Shot,
Shells, Pots, Caldrons, Bells, Battery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
all their Clock-Work, Watch-Work, even &s;o
much as their Toys and Trinkets; all their
Hou&s;e Furniture, Kitchen Furniture, Gla&s;s
Ware, Uphol&s;tery Ware, Tin Ware; in a
Word, every thing we produce, and every
thing we make, and every thing we import:
'T would be endle&s;s to repeat it.</P>
<P>HOW prepo&s;terous mu&s;t tho&s;e Notions be,
and how oddly mu&s;t they think, if they can
be &s;aid to think at all, who &s;ugge&s;t Mi&s;chief
from the Encrea&s;e of our Colonies! Do any
other Nations act thus? Do the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
think their Empires of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,
Chili</HI> and St. <HI>Martha,</HI> too many and too
great, tho' a hundred Times as large as tho&s;e
I am naming; and tho' they drein even
<HI>Spain</HI> it&s;elf of People? Are the <HI>French</HI> jea|lous
<PB N="362" REF="396">
of the Number of their People in the va&s;t
Countries of <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Loui&s;ania?</HI> Do
they not &s;tudy, by all Means po&s;&s;ible, to en|crea&s;e
them, and to extend their Plantations?</P>
<P>HAVE not we People enough to &s;pare?
Do we not encrea&s;e till we are ready to eat
up one another, (I mean in Trade)? and
can we not &s;pare enough of the unprofitable
Part of our People, tho&s;e who are rather
&s;aid to &s;tarve among us than to live? Who,
if they were well &s;ettled there, would be
Indu&s;trious, Thrive, and grow Rich; and
'tis by the Indu&s;trious that Trade is &s;upport|ed,
and Wealth encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>LET us no more amu&s;e our&s;elves, and
rai&s;e the Vapours with our Phlegmatick
Thoughts about every little <HI>German</HI> En|croachment
on our Manufactures, and the
Prohibitions of a few petty Princes in the
North. Here we can rai&s;e a Con&s;umption
of our Manufactures, &s;uperior to all the Ob|&s;truction
they can give us: Here our Ma|nufactures
will never be prohibited; here the
Demand will be for ever encrea&s;ing with the
People; 'tis like a Mill built by the Lord of
the Manor, it grinds for all his Tenants,
and is kept going by his own Stream; &s;o that
on one hand it can never want Work, and
on the other hand can never want Water.</P>
<P>I have not Room to &s;ay more, tho' I
&s;carce know when to leave it off. I conclude
with telling you in a few Words, that here
is the greate&s;t Opening for an Improvement
<PB N="363" REF="397">
of our Trade, and the ea&s;ie&s;t to put in
Practi&s;e, that ever was propo&s;ed, or perhaps
can be proposed to this Nation; and till we
go about it, we ought never to complain
of the Decay of our Trade, or of the want
of a Vent for our Manufactures.</P>
<P>THESE &s;everal Articles of the Improve|ment
of our Commerce, have run out to
&s;uch an unavoidable Length, that I &s;hall
not be able to add &s;ome others, which were
in my De&s;ign, and which are equally advan|tageous
in Proportion to their Circum&s;tan|ces;
but I mu&s;t touch lightly upon them,
and refer them to farther Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AS the Encrea&s;e of Commerce and People
in our Colonies, is, in Con&s;equence of our
Property in them, an Encrea&s;e and Improve|ment
of our Trade in <HI>England,</HI> and in par|ticular
an Encrea&s;e of the Con&s;umption of
our Manufactures; &s;o it is a natural Infe|rence,
and evident to Demon&s;tration, that
an Encrea&s;e of Colonies mu&s;t have the &s;ame
Effect.</P>
<P>I therefore lay it down as a Fundamental,
that additional Colonies, where the People
may plant and &s;ettle to their Advantage, is
a vi&s;ible Improvement to our Trade.</P>
<P>EMPLOYMENT of our People, or as we
call them, our Poor, is the grand Support
of our very being as a Nation without it;
the Poor would eat us up, the Pari&s;h Rates
would in &s;hort devour not the Produce of
our Land only, but the Land it&s;elf; and the
<PB N="364" REF="398">
Church-Wardens would call upon you for
20 <HI>s.</HI> in the Pound for your Beggars.</P>
<P>THIS employing of the Poor is the Effect
of our Manufactures; the Magnitude of which
is, for that very Rea&s;on, already de&s;cribed;
but as our Manufactures employ the Poor,
&s;o Trade carries off the Manufactures, or
el&s;e they would &s;oon over-run the Con|&s;umption,
and come to a full Stop: The
Manufactures &s;upport the Poor, Foreign
Commerce &s;upports the Manufactures, and
planting Colonies &s;upports the Commerce.</P>
<P>HERE you di&s;po&s;e of your encrea&s;ing
Numbers of Poor; they go there poor, and
come back rich; there they plant, trade,
thrive, and encrea&s;e; even your tran&s;ported
Felons, &s;ent to <HI>Virginia</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Tyburn;</HI>
Thou&s;ands of them, if we are not mi&s;in|form'd,
have, by turning their Hands to In|du&s;try
and Improvement, and, which is be&s;t
of all, to Hone&s;ty, become rich &s;ub&s;tantial
Planters and Merchants, &s;ettled large Fami|lies,
and been famous in the Country; nay,
Ave have &s;een many of them made Magi|&s;trates,
Officers of Militia, Captains of the
good Ships, and Matters of good E&s;tates.</P>
<P>THIS Way therefore, I &s;ay, we di&s;po&s;e of
the growing Numbers of our Poor to an in|expre&s;&s;ible
Advantage, as well a publick as
a private Advantage: It is a private Advan|tage,
as 'tis really a Benefit to the Poor that
go, (for pray take me, as I ought to be taken)
When I &s;ay go, I am to be under&s;tood that
<PB N="365" REF="399">
I mean go freely and voluntarily. I am not
moving you to tran&s;port the Poor, that
would be &s;ending them away becau&s;e they
are poor; but tho&s;e who being de&s;titute of
Employment here, are willing to &s;eek it A|broad,
would have a vi&s;ible Advantage, and
would &s;oon give Encouragement to others
to follow them, and Thou&s;ands of &s;uch Fa|milies
would rai&s;e them&s;elves there by their
Indu&s;try, and grow rich; for where Wages
is high, and Provi&s;ions low, as is the Ca&s;e
there, the Labourer mu&s;t be idle, or extra|vagant,
or thriving, and grow rich; and
the Con&s;equence of the diligent labouring
Man there, is always this, that from a meer
Labourer he becomes a Planter, and &s;ettles
his Family upon the Land he gains, and &s;o
grows rich of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Advantage to the Publick I have
&s;poken of, tho' but briefly. I only add
here, That be&s;ides the Encrea&s;e of Com|merce
and People, it nece&s;&s;arily makes an
Encrea&s;e of Seamen, a Point ju&s;t now upon
the Anvil of the State, and which they find
hard enough for the hammering of all the po|litical
Smiths of the Nation; all this growing
Commerce, to and from our Colonies, mu&s;t
be carry'd on by Sea; all the Commerce they
can have there, one Colony with another,
mu&s;t be the &s;ame: The fir&s;t by large Ships
of Force, the la&s;t by Sloops, Ketches, and
&s;mall Ships. The Encrea&s;e of the People en|crea&s;es
the Trade, the Encrea&s;e of the Trade
<PB N="366" REF="400">
encrea&s;es the Number of Ships, and the En|crea&s;e
of Ships calls for an Encrea&s;e of Sea|men:
Thus your Strength, as well as Wealth,
grows with your Colonies, the Climax is
really plea&s;ant to look upon.</P>
<P>MORE Colonies then is, without Que&s;tion,
extending the Commerce; it is enlarging
the Field of Action; it calls in more Hands
to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Publick Pro&s;perity; it em|ploys
profitably the unprofitable Numbers
of your Poor, and lays a Foundation of an
extended Trade, and thereby of a &s;till larger
Exportation from Home.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE I &s;hould propo&s;e a Place in the
World, where, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could plant at
this Time any Numbers of their People, even
the poore&s;t and meane&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing them on|ly
to be indu&s;trious, and willing to live;
for I am not talking of Drones, and <HI>Solo|mon</HI>'s
Sluggards, that will &s;tarve rather than
work; or, as I have &s;aid above, will not
pull their Hand out of their Bo&s;om to put
it to their Mouth. Such will &s;tarve every
where, and may as well &s;tay at Home as go
Abroad: Such will not &s;ow, and how &s;hould
they reap? will not plant, and how &s;hould
they eat?</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, a Spot of Ground,
where a Body of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People being plant|ed,
the Country, by its own native Pro|duction
of Corn and Cattle, would imme|diately
&s;ub&s;i&s;t them; and the being placed in
a Situation to live and trade, they &s;hould
<PB N="367" REF="401">
want no other Support from hence, but their
fir&s;t carrying over, and the Sub&s;i&s;tence of the
fir&s;t Year, till a Harve&s;t &s;upply'd them: Sup|po&s;e
them what Number you plea&s;e, from
one Thou&s;and to an Hundred Thou&s;and, or
&s;uppo&s;e them encrea&s;ed from the one Num|ber
to the other: Grant me but that they
wear Cloths, build, furni&s;h Hou&s;es as they
encrea&s;e, and that they gain enough to pro|vide
nece&s;&s;ary Things for them&s;elves; Is not
the Supply of the&s;e, all Gain to us? Is not
all they take an Encrea&s;e of the Con&s;umption
of our Manufactures and Produce? Is not
every Ship employed between us and them,
&s;o far an Encrea&s;e of Navigation? and &s;o of
all the re&s;t: An Encrea&s;e of Colonies en|crea&s;es
People, People encrea&s;e the Con|&s;umption
of Manufactures, Manufactures
Trade, Trade Navigation, Navigation Sea|men,
and altogether encrea&s;e the Wealth,
Strength, and Pro&s;perity of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>BUT where in the World &s;hould we plant?
what Country pre&s;ents for new Colonies, at
lea&s;t that is not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd or claimed by &s;ome
other Nation? and where can we find a
Place, where, with the Settlement of the
People, a Trade will follow? and from
whence they can, be&s;ides &s;ub&s;i&s;ting plenti|fully
in that Place, find Returns to <HI>Europe,</HI>
to purcha&s;e from us the Manufactures they
want? My An&s;wer is, that if I do not find
out &s;uch Places, I have been &s;aying nothing
all this while: That there is Room enough
<PB N="368" REF="402">
&s;till left on the Surface of the Globe, not taken
up nor claim'd, or pretended to by <HI>Spaniards,
Portugue&s;e, Dutch,</HI> or <HI>French, Dane</HI> or
<HI>Swede, Pope</HI> or <HI>Devil;</HI> Places where 100000
People may immediately plant and build,
find Food, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t plentifully,; the Soil
fruitful, the Climate comfortable, the Air
healthy, unmole&s;ted by Savages and Canibals,
as in <HI>North America;</HI> unravaged by Lions
and Tygers, Elephants and Mon&s;ters, as
in <HI>Africa;</HI> fill'd with Cattle u&s;eful and
eatable, tame and tractable, abounding
with Fi&s;h, Fowl, Fle&s;h, wanting nothing
but to be inhabited by Chri&s;tians, and
ally'd to the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian World by
Commerce and Navigation.</P>
<P>BUT I am too near the End of this Work
to enter upon &s;o large a Subject: It mu&s;t be
treated of by it&s;elf.</P>
