<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>IN antient Time, a far le&s;s Fame than yours</L>
<L>Tran&s;pos'd their Heroes <HI>into Heav'nly Powers:</HI></L>
<L>The forward People, who no Rules contain,</L>
<L>Forgot their Gods, and Sacrific'd to Men.</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="57">
But, as <HI>more Honour, SIR,</HI> becomes your Due,</L>
<L>So we, by better Rules, our Thanks pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>Our Prai&s;e to Heav'n <HI>Exalts our Prai&s;e of you.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That you're a Son of <HI>Great Britannia's Race,</HI></L>
<L>An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Heart beneath an <HI>Engli&s;h Face,</HI></L>
<L>A Martial <HI>Soul,</HI> and a Succe&s;sful <HI>Hand,</HI></L>
<L>Back'd by the faithful Genius of your Land;</L>
<L>This is to place your Image <HI>in the Skies:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Their Gods knew no &s;uch Titles,</HI> SIR, <HI>as the&s;e.</HI></L>

<L>The Glory which your brighter Deeds contain,</L>
<L><HI>Stamps Medals</HI> in the Hearts of <HI>Engli&s;h-men:</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>deep Impre&s;&s;ion</HI>'s made &s;o very &s;trong,</L>
<L>Cut <HI>by your Hand,</HI> it will endure &s;o long,</L>
<L>Ages to come your very Name will ble&s;s,</L>
<L>And your Po&s;terity the Fame po&s;&s;e&s;s.</L>

<PB N="51" REF="58">
<L>The Battles which you fight Abroad, procure</L>
<L>New Peace at home, and <HI>make that Peace &s;ecure.</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Enemies</HI> you Conquer on the <HI>Rhine</HI></L>
<L>Makes our <HI>wor&s;t Enemies at home</HI> decline:</L>
<L>The Dangers on the <HI>Danube</HI> you pur&s;ue,</L>
<L><HI>Le&s;&s;ens our Dangers here,</HI> and makes them few.</L>
<L>And as from Foreign Victories you come,</L>
<L>You <HI>Fight</HI> Abroad, but you <HI>Subdue</HI> at Home.</L>
<L><HI>Faction</HI> and <HI>Parties</HI> fly before your Name;</L>
<L><HI>Faction</HI> and <HI>Parties</HI> die beneath your Fame.</L>
<L>Her Maje&s;ty, and all her People, &s;tand</L>
<L>Debtors to all the Conque&s;ts you obtain'd.</L>
<L>By ev'ry Victory of yours we &s;ee</L>
<L><HI>Safety ri&s;e up</HI> like Vapours from the Sea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For This the Nation, <HI>SIR,</HI> &s;o long has Pray'd,</L>
<L>Such Blood Expended, &s;o much Trea&s;ure Pay'd,</L>
<L>So many Fleets and Armies <HI>rais'd in vain;</HI></L>
<L>For this &s;o many Thou&s;ands have been &s;lain.</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="59">
<HI>Britannia's Sons</HI> the Ble&s;&s;ing oft e&s;&s;ay'd;</L>
<L>But, till You came, <HI>'t has always been deny'd:</HI></L>
<L>In vain they did our Happine&s;s pur&s;ue;</L>
<L>The Promi&s;e &s;tay'd, <HI>SIR, for the Queen and You.</HI></L>
<L>Wi&s;e Providence its Bounty does re&s;train,</L>
<L>Till both the Ble&s;&s;ing's ready, and the Man:</L>
<L>The Agent and the Action he prepares,</L>
<L>He finds the Hero, and he makes the Wars.</L>
<L>Thus Heav'n and You together we admire;</L>
<L>Let they that Prize you more advance you higher.</L>
