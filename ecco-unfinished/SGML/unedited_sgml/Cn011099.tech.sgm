<HEAD>THE
Per&s;on of Quality's
ANSWER
TO
Mr. COLLIER'S LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Dear Doctor,
<DATELINE>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,
<DATE>Jan. <HI>the 27th.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Afternoon, I received your Edifying, Evan|gelical
Di&s;&s;wa&s;ive; for which, What thanks can I
return you? What recompence can be &s;ufficient?
May he, for who&s;e &s;ake you did it, amply Reward you.</P>
<P>I had conceived indeed a Zealous concern at the Di&s;orders
of the Play-Hou&s;e, I lamented its having &s;o much the a&s;cen|dant
of the Town, and the Countenance of Figure and For|tune.
And I too ju&s;tly pre&s;aged that the&s;e Nur&s;eries of Li|cen&s;e
and Athei&s;m, e&s;pecially that in our Neighbourhood, wou'd
if unre&s;train'd, prove fatal to the Nation; make us Ripe for
De&s;truction, and pull down &s;ome terrible Vengeance on our
Heads; <HI>no le&s;s than Popery, or Arbitrary Power at the
lea&s;t, and dear Doctor, What a Day, and what a &s;ight
wou'd that be to you and me?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
For this Rea&s;on I re&s;olved that in my Family, Reforma|tion
and the Year &s;hould begin together, and for that Rea|&s;on
I called them together as &s;oon as they had dined to Day;
determining to Read a long and a &s;olemn Lecture out
of your &s;hort view to them; but a &s;trange fatality had
happened, for &s;ome audacious Rats had &s;o prophanely
gnawn it, that it was no longer legible, a detachment in my
Con&s;cience of Play-Hou&s;e Vermin, whom the Devil had
enter'd into for that purpo&s;e, at his Congregation in the
Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Thus bilk'd of my Homily, I thought I mu&s;t to my
great Grief, have been forced to di&s;mi&s;s my Flock. For
I perceived they were grown <HI>frightfully Nice and Impa|tient,
and were re&s;olved to be cur'd extempore or not at
all.</HI></P>
<P>But then it was that in an au&s;picious Moment, arriv'd
your &s;hort, but Divine Di&s;&s;wa&s;ive. I read it over as it
were in a Breath, while they all the while &s;tood gaping
to entertain it. But the la&s;t incomparable Paragraph but
one, I pronounc'd with a more Emphatical Voice; Laid
before them with all the Energy of my Lungs, <HI>the &s;ad
in&s;tance of God's Judgment in the Terrible Tempest, when we
were almo&s;t &s;wept into Chaos,</HI> when Nature <HI>&s;eem'd to be in
her last Agony, and the World &s;eem'd ready to expire.</HI>
And what occa&s;ion &s;aid I to my gaping Audience, to have
recour&s;e to Tragedies, when tho&s;e Rants, that Fu&s;tian,
and that Bomba&s;t, with which deluded Mortals, are
now a days &s;o tickled, are engagingly in&s;erted into our
very Di&s;&s;wa&s;ives?</P>
<P>And here Doctor I made two Remarks to them, upon
the Judgment of the late Dreadful Tempe&s;t. For fir&s;t
&s;aid I, the outcries of the Play-Hou&s;e practices are &s;o Ag|gravating,
&s;o Horrible, that the Divine Vengeance which
they brought down upon us, has involv'd the very Inno|cent.
Not only the Poor Inhabitants of <HI>Cologn,</HI> but the
<PB N="3" REF="5">
very <HI>Hamburghers</HI> and <HI>Dantzichers,</HI> and all the People of
the <HI>Baltick,</HI> have &s;uffer'd for the Enormities of our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Theatres; tho' I believe in my Con&s;cience they never
&s;o much as heard of a Play, and know no more the dif|ference
between a Tragedy and Comedy, than they do
the di&s;tance between the Earth and Saturn; &s;o that, &s;aid
I, you may ob&s;erve from hence, 'tis not enough to keep
away from the&s;e lewd Entertainments; but you mu&s;t en|deavour
with all your might to &s;uppre&s;s the Conventicles
of Satan.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Ob&s;ervation that I made was this, that we
have rea&s;on to be thankful to Heaven, for forbearing us &s;o
long. For if the late Dreadful Judgment had happen'd in
the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when the Play-Hou&s;es
were Licentious in all their Impunity, when Reformation
was &s;o far from being thought of, that the very name
was de&s;pi&s;ed and laugh'd at. What mu&s;t the di&s;mal Con|&s;equence
not have been? Then we &s;hould certainly have
been &s;wallow'd up; &s;ince the <HI>Judgment</HI> was &s;o terrible even
the other Day, after a five Years Reformation?</P>
<P>What rea&s;on have we to be thankful, that we live in an
Age in which Light is come into the World. For in what
<HI>Aegyptian</HI> darkne&s;s have we liv'd hitherto? And what a
poor Reformation was that which was carried on in Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, in Compari&s;on of that which you are
gloriou&s;ly projecting? For with that former Reformation
the Play-Hou&s;e began; grew up and &s;pread and flouri&s;h'd.
What a &s;hadow of a Reformation was that? 'Tis true
Popery was driven out, and whol&s;ome Laws were Enacted
to &s;ecure the Rights of the Pople. But what &s;ignified all
that when the Play-Hou&s;e was encourag'd? For tho' as
you learnedly ob&s;erve, Play-Hou&s;es, in the Reign of that
Great Queen, were not permitted to be erected in the Li|berties
of the City, yet in the Subburbs they were not only
permitted but encourag'd with a Vengeance; and by whom
<PB N="4" REF="6">
encourag'd? Why not only by the People, but by the
Court, nay, by the Council, yes by tho&s;e poor deluded
Wretches, <HI>Cecil</HI> and <HI>Wal&s;ingham,</HI> who believ'd it to be the
bu&s;ine&s;s of for&s;ooth Wi&s;e States-Men, to provide Hone&s;t
and Rea&s;onable Diver&s;ions for the People; and at the &s;ame
time were &s;o infatuated, &s;o intoxicated, as to believe the
Entertainments of the Theatre, not only to be Hone&s;t and
Rea&s;onable, but the only Hone&s;t and Rea&s;onable Diver|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Nay the poor mi&s;taken Queen her &s;elf, encouraged Play-Hou&s;es
to that degree, that &s;he not only commanded
<HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> to write the Comedy of the <HI>Merry Wives,</HI> and
to write it in Ten Days time; &s;o eager was &s;he for the wicked
Diver&s;ion; but ev'n with that Hand that weilded the Scep|ter
de&s;cended poorly to Tran&s;late a Play that was writ by
a <HI>Grecian</HI> Poet. She had read it &s;eems of &s;ome Great Men
among the <HI>Romans,</HI> who had &s;hewn the way; As <HI>Julius
Coe&s;ar</HI> had writ <HI>Adra&s;tus, Augu&s;tus Ajax, Gracchus Thye&s;tes,</HI>
and <HI>Mecenas Octavia,</HI> and &s;he wanted Judgment, alas poor
Woman, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the obligations of a Hea|then
and a Chri&s;tian. 'Tis true &s;he was Wi&s;e enough in
&s;ome things, &s;he kept out Popery and Arbitrary Power,
&s;he defended us from <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> by the meer Force
of her Prudence. But what &s;ignified that, you know
Doctor, when &s;he encourag'd the Play-Hou&s;es, and wanted
fore-&s;ight in that particular, to pre&s;age that the&s;e Nur&s;eries
of Vice and Athei&s;m would prove fatal to the Nation?</P>
<P>It &s;eems &s;ome Fools about her had told her, that at a
time when Taxes were frequent and grievous, &s;ome hone&s;t
Diver&s;ions would comfort the People, but that it would be
unrea&s;onable to deprive them at once of their Money, and
of their Plea&s;ure too; this &s;he had been told, and &s;he like
an ea&s;ie Woman believ'd it. But what amazes me mo&s;t is
this Doctor, that not only that Queen and her Council en|couraged
Plays, but not &s;o much as one of the Famous Pre|lates
<PB N="5" REF="7">
in her time &s;aid &s;o much as a word again&s;t them. 'Tis
true, the State-Men defended us again&s;t <HI>Spain</HI> very vigor|ou&s;ly,
and very effectually, and &s;o did the Church-Men
again&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> See; but alas their poor and narrow
Spirits contented them&s;elves with that. But not &s;o much as
one word was &s;aid again&s;t the Abominations of the Play-Hou&s;es.
There were Reformers indeed! Were they &s;o
&s;en&s;le&s;s that they wanted di&s;cernment to &s;ee the <HI>flaming and
outragious wickedne&s;s</HI> of them? Or &s;o very wicked that
they wanted Zeal to di&s;charge their Duty in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
it? Ah my dear Doctor, Had you but liv'd in tho&s;e Times,
you would have taught that Queen her Le&s;&s;on, in Loyal
Libels have told her her Duty, affronted her Authority, de|fam'd
her Servants, and boldly have told her that &s;he Coun|tenanc'd
them only to Debauch her People. You would
have open'd the Eyes of tho&s;e Fools, who believ'd <HI>Shake|&s;pear</HI>
to be In&s;tructive as well as Innocent. You would
have extracted more <HI>Smutt</HI> from his Comedies, than a
Chimney does from Seacoal. And what Prophanene&s;s and
Bla&s;phemy had you not found in his Tragedies? You
would have &s;atisfied both Queen and Council, and Clergy
too, that their bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;uppre&s;s the Play-Hou&s;es,
and to let <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> alone. That the Danger that they
were in was not from <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, and <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fifth;
but from Tyrants who had been many a Year defunct from
<HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Macbeth;</HI> you would have <HI>pre&s;aged</HI> the
Storm that the latter would have pull'd down upon the
Nation, a Hundred Years after 'twas writ. You had then
been <HI>Hi&s;trio Ma&s;tix</HI> the fir&s;t, whereas you are now but
the &s;econd of that glorious Name; and then had old
Bungling <HI>Pryn</HI> been cropt for pre&s;uming to Copy you.
Thus, my dear Doctor, we have rea&s;on to believe what you
would have done, from what we behold you do. For tho'
Popery and Slavery are at our Doors, and each moment
are ru&s;hing in upon us; and nothing but the Wi&s;dom of one
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Woman &s;tands between us and them, yet you &s;till retain
your commendable Pa&s;&s;ive Principle, appear as unconcern'd
as if you had Sworn to be a Foe to neither, are found to
be as little alarm'd for the Church, as if you had thrown
off its Cau&s;e as you have ca&s;t off its Habit; and in&s;tead of
crying out Slavery, Popery, do nothing but cry out the
Play-Hou&s;e, the Play-Hou&s;e, with as much Fury as if you
were afraid it &s;hould contribute to the keeping them
out.</P>
<P>But my dear Doctor, By the leave of your Mode&s;ty, I
mu&s;t exalt your Glory to a higher pitch. When Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> died King <HI>James</HI> &s;ucceeded him; and among the
Eminent Reformers of his Reign there was no talk of the
Stage. Nay, on the contrary, to their &s;hame be it &s;poken,
that King and his Court appear'd to be infinitely delighted
with Plays. And in his Vi&s;its to the two Univer&s;ities,
Plays were the chief of his Entertainment. But what would
we have Doctor; as the Education is, &s;o is the Youth.
And he had been tutour'd by old <HI>George,</HI> a Notorious Re|former,
but a Notorious Playwright. For the Sot believ'd
if &s;eems that the <HI>Drama</HI> could contribute to the Reforma|tion
of Mankind.</P>
<P>To King <HI>James</HI> &s;ucceeded King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t; and
then aro&s;e another Famous Reformer, <HI>John Milton</HI> by name,
who not only left a Tragedy behind him, the Story of
which he impiou&s;ly borrow'd from the Bible, written to
leave him without excu&s;e in his mature, nay declining
Years, but has left a fine Encomium on <HI>Shake&s;pear;</HI> has
&s;hewn an extraordinary e&s;teem for <HI>John&s;on;</HI> and among all
the things that he thought fit to Reform, &s;o far had pre|judice
laid hold of his Under&s;tanding, it never &s;o much as
came into his Head that the Stage was one of them.</P>
<P>But then about that time, Doctor, there aro&s;e a Reformer
indeed, Brother <HI>Pryn</HI> of Illu&s;trious Memory; a Per&s;on in|deed
of an <HI>amazing</HI> boldne&s;s. For to the fervency of his
<PB N="7" REF="9">
Furious Spirit, Ruine and Reformation were all one. With
the&s;e Zealot's Thoughts he &s;et about Reforming the Church
as well as the Stage; and by preparing the downfal of one
made way for the Ruine of the other. 'Tis true, he lo&s;t
&s;ome part of him&s;elf in the Cau&s;e. But happy the Ears
that were &s;o lo&s;t! How much happier than tho&s;e that
&s;tand pricking up daily at the Ribaldry of our Modern
Comedies? I know, dear Doctor, under the Ro&s;e, that
you have the &s;ame De&s;ign, and that you will never leave
off writing as long as there is left either a Prelate or Poet in
<HI>England;</HI> or if you do conde&s;cend to admit of Bi&s;hops,
you will at lea&s;t &s;uffer no &s;uch Bi&s;hops as have a Tang of
the Stage, I mean no Swearing Prophane Bi&s;hops, but &s;uch
who&s;e Meek and Chri&s;tian Communication is only Yea and
Nay.</P>
<P>As you have the &s;ame noble De&s;ign, may you find
better Fortune, as you well de&s;erve. For he, my dear
Doctor, was but a Type, of your more Excellent &s;elf,
tho' indeed an Illu&s;trious Type. And he but anticipated
in a cold and gloomy way, the very things that Fate had
de&s;igned to be &s;aid with Fire and Flame by you. He indeed
overthrew but for a time the Church and Stage together.
But may you with a more propitious Fate&mdash;. But hold!&mdash;
No Man, you know is able to tell into who&s;e hands a Letter
may fall.</P>
<P>Thus, Doctor the ble&s;&s;ed Work of Reformation went on;
and down went the Bi&s;hops and the Stage together; but
after they had lain for &s;ome time in the du&s;t were re&s;tor'd
together, and with them the bani&s;h'd King.</P>
<P>And there are not People wanting, who believe, that the
Re&s;toring the Stage, was one of the Motives to the Re|&s;toring
the bani&s;h'd King, for &s;ay they, the People of
<HI>England</HI> were at la&s;t grown weary of a Na&s;ty, Gloomy,
Sullen, Fanatical Government, and began to long for their
Plea&s;ures. How my dear Doctor? The re&s;toring the
<PB N="8" REF="10">
Stage was one of the Motives to re&s;toring the bani&s;h'd King.
Ah my dear Doctor, if you had but flouri&s;h'd in that Au|&s;picious
Juncture; How happy would you have e&s;teem'd
your &s;elf to have been the In&s;trument of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the
Stage, only on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it re&s;tor'd with &s;uch a Glo|rious
Attendant.</P>
<P>Well! The King, the Bi&s;hops and the Stage were re|&s;tored
together, and a long time flouri&s;h'd together, with|out
any talk of reforming the Play-Hou&s;es, much le&s;s of
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing them. For the Merry Mini&s;ters of that Happy
Prince laugh'd at a Reformation. And even the former
Mini&s;ters of the Church at that time, among whom were
certainly &s;ome of the greate&s;t Men that the Chri&s;tian World
has produc'd; appear'd by no means to be &s;o terribly
alarm'd at the Entertainments of the Stage.</P>
<P>You your &s;elf, I remember Doctor, were then at Years
of Di&s;cretion; and yet with Pa&s;&s;ive Ears and Tongue, en|dur'd
the Filth of <HI>Ep&s;om</HI>-Wells, the Bawdy of the Soldier's
Fortune, and the Bea&s;tline&s;s of <HI>Limber-Ham.</HI> But the time
of your Prophetick Mi&s;&s;ion it &s;eems was not yet come, or
perhaps you thought it improper to fall out with the Play-Hou&s;es,
before you had fallen out with the Government.
But you have at la&s;t, to the wonder of the World, declar'd
your &s;elf, and we may &s;ay of you, what <HI>Lucretius</HI> &s;aid of
his ador'd <HI>Epicurus,</HI> Pardon the Compari&s;on, I be&s;eech you
Doctor,
<Q><LG>
<L>That you in Wit &s;urpa&s;s Mankind as far,</L>
<L>As does the Midday Sun, the Midnight Star.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>For what in the Beginning of the Reformation was never
&s;een, neither by <HI>Jewell,</HI> nor <HI>Ridley,</HI> nor <HI>Cranmer,</HI> nor <HI>La|timer;</HI>
nor was afterwards hardly &s;o much as thought of,
by the Judicious, the Penetrating, the Sagacious <HI>Hooker;</HI>
nor what in this latter end of it, (as under the Ro&s;e we
<PB N="9" REF="11">
&s;weetly hope Doctor) has not been found out nei|ther
by <HI>Wilkins</HI> nor <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> who have &s;hown &s;o
much Under&s;tanding and &s;o much Judgment; as well
by the force of their Invincible Arguments, as of
their Clear, Cha&s;te, Noble and Ma&s;culine Styles;
What none of the&s;e have been able to find, you
have plainly convinc'd the World of; that the Play-Hou&s;e
would bring all to ruine; O Miracle of
boundle&s;s Sagacity! O Prodigy of Penetration!
The late Arch-Bi&s;hop was certainly a Man of as un|doubted
Probity, of as much Integrity, as ever liv'd
of cutting a Man's Throat out of Zeal to Con|&s;ute
his Doctrine; the late Archbi&s;hop, I &s;ay, Doctor,
who had &s;o much Boldne&s;s, as well as Zeal and In|tegrity,
and who in the late Reign had &s;o much
Pow'r; never &s;aw this dreadful Danger from Plays,
which you have &s;o plainly di&s;cover'd.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">There is &s;omething in the E|leventh V$lume of h$ Sermons $gain&s;t <HI>Play</HI> which I h$ not &s;een when this was Writ but Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> h$ prevarica$ted vilel$ in the Qu$tation.</NOTE> For if he had
&s;een it, he would have prevail'd upon the late Queen
to &s;uppre&s;s them. He either fore&s;aw none of this
Danger, or if he did, the good mi&s;taken Man, thought
there would be more in going about to prevent it.
An infallible &s;ign that he wanted your fore-&s;ight and
your Sagacity. He look'd upon him&s;elf to be indi|&s;pen&s;ably
bound in a double re&s;pect to Reform the
Corruptions of the times. For he was both Head
of the Church, and fir&s;t Cou&s;ellour of State. And
no Man knew better then that Judicious Prelate,
that Corruptions of Manners are mo&s;t pernicious both
to Church and State. And no Man ever di&s;cover'd
<PB N="10" REF="12">
more Zeal for the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, both in
Church and State. And yet poor Man with all his
Under&s;tanding, and all his Zeal, he was &s;o far deluded
in this particular, that he never medled with the&s;e
Nur&s;eries of Licen&s;e and Athei&s;m. As many
admirable Sermons as he left behind him, again&s;t the
Vices and the Errors of the Times; I believe you
will hardly find that he has mentioned the Play-Hou&s;es
with bitterne&s;s in them all. He left that part
of Reformation for your &s;ublimer Prudence, and more
Heroick Charity. Indeed the Concern that he had
him&s;elf both in Church and State was &s;o apparent,
that perhaps he might fear that a violent endeavour to
Reform our Theatres in him might look like Intere&s;t;
and might perhaps imagine that the Work would be
kindlier received, if it were carried on by one who
cared not a Farthing either for Church or State.</P>
<P>And here Doctor give me leave to admire the Glory,
or to &s;peak in your own Diviner Language, the
<HI>Meridian blaze of your my&s;terious Charity. 'Tis of an
amazing &s;ize and brightne&s;s,</HI> and our weak Eyes are
dazled at it. For that you dear Doctor, who ap|pear
&s;o extreamly Nice and Scrupulous, that you dare
not &s;o much as take an Oath to defend our Sove|reign
Lady and us, again&s;t our Mortal Enemies; you
who are &s;o over cautious that you dare not &s;o much
as hold any Communion with us, that you &s;hould
take up this extream concern for our Souls, that you
&s;hould be &s;o violent for our Salvation, is beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion
wonderful. When I con&s;ider that all who are
engaged by Duty, are either Dumb or very cold in
the Matter, while you are declaiming with &s;o much
&s;ervour, with &s;o much zeal, again&s;t the Di&s;orders of
<PB N="11" REF="13">
our Theatres, you who have nothing to do with the
matter; I can never &s;ufficiently admire the exce&s;s of
your Zeal, which is too high and too Heavenly to
be comprehended by a Mortal.</P>
<P>I can only &s;ay, that 'tis a thou&s;and pities 'tis con|fin'd
to &s;o narrow a Sphere. But, alas! good Man,
it is none of your fault that it is not more univer&s;al.
For we have rea&s;on to be &s;en&s;ible, that if you were
not re&s;train'd, by the apprehen&s;ion of Brutal and Bea&s;t|ly
Force, you would not fail to declaim with the &s;ame
heat and the &s;ame bitterne&s;s again&s;t both Church and
State.</P>
<P>This amazing brightne&s;s of your Charity, has drawn
upon you the Envy of &s;ome good Men; has made
you become the Hatred of Libertines, and the Je&s;t and
Scorn of Buffoons. I Doctor am your Champion a|gain&s;t
them all; and I have many a Bickering in your
behalf, even with my moderate Friends; who are in|deed
for Reforming the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Stage,
but are by no means for a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Play-Hou&s;es.
Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> &s;ays one of them is too &s;evere.
He does not con&s;ider the times that we live in.
The&s;e are not the Primitive Apo&s;tolical Times, but
the la&s;t and Corrupt Ages of the World. The Ca|pital
of a great Kingdom mu&s;t have Meetings for pub|lick
Plea&s;ure. If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is for pulling down Plays;
let him name a more Harmle&s;s and Rea&s;onable diver|&s;ion
to be E&s;tabli&s;hed in the room of them. What
would he have us always at our Devotion? Or does
he expect that we &s;hould be all Devout? Would he
have Devotion a Mode and Fa&s;hion, as it is in <HI>France.</HI>

Punk at <HI>Ver&s;aills,</HI> as the mo&s;t Glorious Madam
<HI>de Maintenon.</HI> 'Tis true, &s;aid he, there are things in
&s;ome of our Plays, that I could heartily wi&s;h were
out, but Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is too rigid, too har&s;h, and out of
all mea&s;ure &s;evere. He does not bear with the lea&s;t
faults, and &s;eems to have no Indulgence for Human
frailty. Thus Doctor you were attack'd the other
Day by a Friend of mine, and you &s;hall &s;ee how I de|fended
you.</P>
<P>Lord Sir, &s;ays I, you are the mo&s;t mi&s;taken Man in
the World. Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is no &s;uch Per&s;on as you ima|gine.
He is a good natur'd, &s;weet temper'd Man as
lives. And will bear as far as any Man whatever.
And as for your &s;aying that he has no Indulgence
for Human frailty, why 'tis a &s;ign that you don't
know him. 'Tis true, he has taken a fatal aver&s;ion to
the Play-Hou&s;e; and he will down with it. We have
all of us an aver&s;ion for &s;ome thing or other. And
why &s;hould you be &s;o much concern'd for that <HI>Ren|devouz
of Rakes and Strumpets?</HI> But yet Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>
has Indulgence enough for them too, any where but in
the Play-Hou&s;e. And where's the mighty hard&s;hip
then upon them? Are there no places for them to a&s;|&s;emble
but there? Are there not Taverns, Brandy-Shops,
Coffee-Hou&s;es, Chocolate-Hou&s;es, Gaming-Hou&s;es
for the Rakes, and Indian-Hou&s;es, Mu&s;ick-Hou&s;es,
Bawdy-Hou&s;es, either for Strumpets Solitary, or Strum|pets
and Rakes in Conjunction according as they plea&s;e.
Has Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> writ one Word for five Years together
again&s;t any of the&s;e places? For God&s;ake what do
you call want of Indulgence then? Is not every Coffee-Hou&s;e
in Town grown a Gaming-Hou&s;e? May not
<PB N="13" REF="15">
we go every Hour of the Day into &s;everal of them,
and &s;ee and hear twenty Fellows Swearing and Bla&s;phe|ming,
and one &s;urrounded by that horrid Crew.</P>
<Q><L>Shaking with Bloody Oaths the Box,</L>
<L>And calling upon Plague and Pox</L>
<L>T' a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</L></Q>
<P>Why, there they may Swear and be damn'd for all
Mr. <HI>Collier.</HI> He troubles him&s;elf with Swearing no
where but in the Play-Hou&s;e? But what do you
mean by Human Frailty? When People are wicked
in earne&s;t that's &s;omething. He has nothing to &s;ay
again&s;t &s;uch. But to be Vicious in Je&s;t, to play the
Fool with the Devil, to counterfeit Sin for&s;ooth on
pretence of decrying it, why the&s;e are <HI>dreadful pro|vocations,
this is flaming, and outragious wickedne&s;s.</HI>
And wickedne&s;s, which he is po&s;itively and ab&s;olutely
re&s;olv'd that he will not endure.</P>
<P>Come, Come &s;ays he, I begin to be &s;en&s;ible of the
matter. Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is now declining in Years; and
the Affairs of the World go not according to his
Wi&s;hes. And Age and Di&s;appointments have &s;owr'd
his Blood, and made him loo&s;e the reli&s;h of Sports and
gay Diver&s;ions. Once more &s;aid I, you are the mo&s;t
mi&s;taken Man in the World; Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is far from
being a Foe to the gaye&s;t Sports and Pa&s;times; But
then he is for having tho&s;e who frequent them take the
con&s;ent and approbation of the <HI>Nonjuring</HI> Clergy along
with them, who you know are <HI>Per&s;ons of Sobriety and
Conduct.</HI> He'll tell you, that the Sports that good Bi&s;hop
<HI>Laud</HI> appointed for the Sabbath, were not only &s;afe
but commendable. That for example, Cricket when
<PB N="14" REF="16">
it came to be &s;o recommended, immediately became
Canonical, Foot-Ball Orthodox, and Jugle-Cat, <HI>Jure
Divino.</HI> But for the Layety to be &s;o impertinent as
to chu&s;e diver&s;ions for them&s;elves; and particularly
for the Ladies to believe that they have Capacities
enough to Judge between right and wrong, and to di|&s;tingui&s;h
Decency from what is not <HI>Decorum,</HI> he takes
to be an Enormity that is never to be allow'd of in
any Chri&s;tian Country.</P>
<P>The Play-Hou&s;e &s;aid I, is one of tho&s;e which
Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> believes to be too Lu&s;cious a Pa&s;time
for the Layity. To &s;ee and to read Plays,
he thinks is enough, for one of his E&s;tabli&s;h'd
Virtue. And it mu&s;t be own'd, that he has read or
&s;een more than any Per&s;on in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> As for the
Layity le&s;s vigorous Diver&s;ions may &s;erve them. The
Men may take a Game at Bowls in the Summer, and a
Game at Whisk in the Winter. The Women in Winter
may vi&s;it their grave Relations, and in Summer Evenings
may take a Boat to cool them&s;elves.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">The &s;ame Company for the mo&s;t part that frequents the <HI>Park</HI> frequents the <HI>Play-Hou&s;e.</HI></NOTE> For as for the <HI>Park,</HI>
he &s;ays, that is a place that <HI>is too much frequented by Rakes
and Strumpets. He does not mean, he &s;ays, that all the
Company there are &s;o; but this he may affirm he &s;ays,
that &s;carce any Quarter is &s;ometimes &s;o plentifully
&s;tock'd. Now who &s;ays Mr.</HI> Collier, <HI>would tru&s;t his
Health in a place of Mortality, or go to the Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e
for Recreation.</HI> Thus Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> like a Per|&s;on
of Conduct and Sobriety, treats the Layity with
the &s;ame Circum&s;pection, that a <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t does
his Congregation at high Ma&s;s, who only delivers the
Wafer to the People, and re&s;erves the Wine for him|&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
But Doctor I had almo&s;t forgot one thing, that I
urg'd among the re&s;t in your Defence, and that was
the Rea&s;on why you &s;tick &s;o clo&s;e to the Play-Hou&s;e,
and let &s;ome other <HI>flaming</HI> Vices alone, which he
was plea&s;ed to enumerate. And that was that you
took this way of proceeding, to be laying the Ax to
the Devili&s;h Root of the accur&s;ed Branches, that the
Play-Hou&s;e was the undoubted Cau&s;e of all the Iniquity
in the Nation; and that if we could but down with
that, a &s;uddain Reformation would follow among all
&s;orts of People. That Porters would no longer be
Drunk with Belch. That Vigorous Captains would be
Tilting no more at Hand&s;ome Drawers in Taverns,
that lo&s;ing Game&s;ters would no more Bla&s;pheme, and
my Lady <HI>Dabcheeks</HI> Ba&s;&s;et-Bank would be immediately
broke.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the things that I have &s;aid in your behalf
to &s;everal of the Enemies of your Short View and De|fence.
I now come to tell you what has happen'd
upon the receiving your Di&s;&s;wa&s;&s;ive; tho' 'tis &s;carce
three Hours &s;ince its arrival. Immediately upon the
reading it, my Elde&s;t Son <HI>Jack</HI> told me that he was
perfectly &s;atisfied that Plays were abominable; and
taking his Hat, his Sword and his Cloak, went away
for St. <HI>James</HI>'s. My Elde&s;t Daughter <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> is gone
to take a walk in the Garden, to Meditate there in the
Dark; that &s;he may have the Arguments in Readine&s;s,
by which &s;he &s;ays &s;he de&s;igns to Convert her Si&s;ter.
But my Younger Son <HI>Charles</HI> made &s;ome Objections,
and &s;o did my Daughter <HI>Harriet,</HI> which I here &s;end
you as well as I can recollect them, becau&s;e I know
Doctor that you are able to an&s;wer them better than I
can.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
Sir, &s;ays <HI>Charles,</HI> I have promis'd my Lady <HI>Freelove</HI>
to Day, to wait upon her to the Play, and &s;o has my
Si&s;ter <HI>Harriet;</HI> but for the future I promi&s;e you to
keep away, and &s;o I dare &s;ay will my Si&s;ter, if you
will but an&s;wer &s;ome Objections that we have to make
again&s;t Mr. <HI>Colliers</HI> Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>I know no Rea&s;on, why Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> &s;hould pretend
to meddle with our Diver&s;ions. If he is really offend|ed
at Plays him&s;elf, in the name of God let him keep
away, I know no body who is fond of his Company
there. But &s;ince we don't pretend to oblige him to
come, Why &s;hould he pre&s;ume to oblige us to keep away?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is really offended at Play-Hou&s;es, I
would fain know how long he has been &s;o, or what is
the Rea&s;on that he did not write again&s;t them when he
was Young. For the Stage was really then more Li|centious
than it is now. Since he forbore writing a|gain&s;t
them till he was Old, we humbly de&s;ire that we
may not leave them till we are Old. And then perhaps,
we may have &s;ome natural or &s;ome politick Con&s;idera|tions
that may oblige us to rail as much as he does.</P>
<P>How comes this Man to take up &s;o much concern
for us? Is it Chri&s;tian Charity, and a tender care for
our Souls? I would fain ask him one Que&s;tion, Is
not true Religion that which is chiefly nece&s;&s;ary for
the Salvation of Souls? If he &s;ays it is, Why then
let me ask him another Que&s;tion. Is the Religion
which we of the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church of <HI>England</HI> pro|fe&s;s
the true one, or is it not? If it is, Why does
not he hold Communion with us? If it is not, Why
does not he &s;et us right? Has he a concern for our
<PB N="17" REF="19">
Souls or not? If he has, Why does he not mind the
main thing? If he has not, Why does he pretend to
make us unea&s;ie, and &s;et us together by the Ears about
trifles?</P>
<P>Is it a concern for the State that makes him take
up his Pen; becau&s;e perhaps he believes that the Cor|ruptions
of the Stage may prove of Dangerous Con|&s;equence
to the Government. But if he has that ex|tream
concern for it, Why does he not take an Oath
to be true to it? Why does he not Abjure the Gen|tleman
who dwells at St. <HI>Germains?</HI> He believes us
Schi&s;maticks, and he believes us Rebels, and takes no
notice of the matter. But if we talk of going to a Play,
the Man's Zeal grows flaming and outragious upon it.
Certainly his is a very nice, and very extraordinary
Charity!</P>
<P>But if he is offended at Plays, &s;o much as he pre|tends,
Why does he &s;ee them, why does he read them
&s;o much? Why &s;hould he be &s;o ridiculou&s;ly conceited,
and &s;o &s;piritually proud, as to think that he can &s;tand
under Temptations, under which we mu&s;t fall?</P>
<P>If he has &s;o much aver&s;ion for Plays as he pretends,
if they are &s;o very horrible, Why has he read &s;o many?
Why has he done evil that good may come of it? If
he really loves them, and they are not &s;o abominable,
Why has he writ again&s;t them? If he has writ again&s;t
Plays that he loves, How comes it that he &s;ays no|thing
again&s;t the Church and State which he
hates?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">
What Rea&s;on can be given for that, unle&s;s that he
waits for his opportunity, which by &s;etting us at
variance about trifles; he hopes in &s;ome mea&s;ure to
ha&s;ten, or unle&s;s, while in the Face of the World he
is Bombarding the Stage, he is diligently in private
undermining the Church and the State?</P>
<P>In this Age of univer&s;al Tolleration, when Non|&s;en&s;e

that Gloomy, Sullen, Lifele&s;s Non&s;en&s;e, which is

Schi&s;maticks, believe &s;ome of them Hereticks, yet we
are not for Reforming them again&s;t their Wills, nor
&s;aving them out of Malice. And we thought we
might have hop'd, at lea&s;t that the Government might
have hop'd that at the &s;ame time that it Indulges
&s;ome of them, not only in different ways of Wor|&s;hip,
but ways which are di&s;agreeable, and &s;ome of
them prejudicial to it, and ways which neither are,
nor were, nor never will be tollerated in any other
Kingdom of <HI>Europe;</HI> we thought, I &s;ay, that the Go|vernment
might have hop'd that the&s;e very Per&s;ons
would have born with a Diver&s;ion, which is E&s;tabli&s;h'd

by that, and which is not only protected by each of
the Governments of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Kingdoms

of publick Authority in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Nations;
and has been believed by them all to be the fitte&s;t
Entertainment that can be allow'd by publick Autho|rity.
At a time when the Government has &s;hewn &s;o
much Indulgence for them; might it not be expected
that they &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome Regard for that, and not
demand with furious Clamours, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of an
Entertainment, E&s;tabli&s;h'd by its Authority? For are
not the&s;e Clamours again&s;t the Queen who&s;e Servants

<P>Pray Sir Con&s;ider, Have we &s;pent &s;o much Blood
and Trea&s;ure in the Defence of our Liberties, And
&s;hall we &s;uffer an Inqui&s;ition to be &s;et up for that
which is the very Life and Soul of Liberty, and that
is harmle&s;s Plea&s;ure; for 'tis for harmle&s;s Plea&s;ure we
only contend. Let the Corruptions of the Stage be
bani&s;h'd, but let the re&s;t remain. Yet at the &s;ame
time it mu&s;t be allowed that it is not Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> who is
a proper Judge of their Innocence or their Guilt. One
wou'd Judge my Lord <HI>Chamberlain</HI> and the Ma&s;ter of
the Revels have common Sen&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h right
from wrong. Is Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> a Per&s;on fit to be ap|peal'd
to from them? And &s;hall we not dare to go
to a Play, till his Licen&s;e-Office is open? Shall we
&s;uffer our &s;elves to be led by the No&s;e by a Decla|mator,
till we are brought into &s;uch a condition that

Hypocri&s;ie to pa&s;s upon us for exact and &s;crupulous
Virtue, Tropes for Rea&s;on, and Foppi&s;h Affectation for
fine Language?</P>
<P>Shall we not only &s;uffer an Inqui&s;ition to be &s;et
up for Plea&s;ure, but as it were by univer&s;al implicit
con&s;ent permit his Di&s;ciples to &s;et up them&s;elves for
Inqui&s;itors? When the Government of <HI>England</HI> pre|tends
to give no Laws to the People, but by virtue
of their own Election, and their own Con&s;ent; Shall
the Rabble erect them&s;elves into Legi&s;lators, and pre|&s;ume
to give Laws to the Queen her &s;elf, and all the
Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> whether they will
or no?</P>
<P>What has Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> to do with our Diver&s;ions?
Let him prove the Authority of his Mi&s;&s;ion to Preach
up th' aboli&s;hing of that Heathen Invention a Play-Hou&s;e.
Cannot we meet together in a Play-Hou&s;e,
where we have no manner of De&s;ign upon Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI>
without alarming him; and rai&s;ing his Pa&s;&s;ions as he
calls it to Combu&s;tion; when at the &s;ame time we
have &s;uffer'd him &s;o long to meet in his &s;eparate
Congregations, where we rea&s;onably believe that
he has a De&s;ign upon us. Certainly his is a plea|&s;ant
Charity, who in the very Hour of Death can
Ab&s;olve an Impenitent Traytor, and Damn a poor
Fellow with Ab&s;olute Power only for going to the
Play-Hou&s;e. What can he mean at this time of
Day, when our Religion and Laws and Liberties are
in the utmo&s;t Danger, from the De&s;igns of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Rome</HI> abroad, and a ba&s;e Perfidious Party at
Home, thus to divert Men from looking after their

all, by &s;caring them with ridiculous Pre&s;ages from the
Corruptions of the Stage? If Corruptions contrary
to the Queens knowledge have crept into our Thea|tres,
and Corruptions too Enormous to be born by
his &s;crupolous Virtue; Why did he not as his
Loyalty oblig'd him to do, humbly Petition her
Maje&s;ty to Redre&s;s them, in&s;tead of making u&s;e of
the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Pre&s;s, to rai&s;e Seditious Cla|mours
again&s;t her Conduct to the People?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd there are Corruptions
which are crept into our Theatres, for into what
Human Inventions will not Corruptions creep, &s;ince
it is plain that they in&s;en&s;ibly creep into Religion
which is of Divine E&s;tabli&s;hment. But 'twould be
a Mon&s;trous Conclu&s;ion, that becau&s;e of the Cor|ruptions
of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> Reveal'd Religion
ought to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and Men to turn Dei&s;ts or
Athei&s;ts.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there are pa&s;&s;ages in &s;everal of our
Plays, which I could heartily wi&s;h were out. But
neither do I &s;ee a quarter &s;o many as Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>
does, nor do I look upon tho&s;e which I do &s;ee, thro'
his magnifying opticks. The long view that he has
taken of Smutt, as he very quaintly calls it, in his
&s;hort view of the Stage, puts me in mind of a
<HI>Dutch</HI> Grote&s;y that is at my Lady <HI>Freeloves;</HI> where
there is an Antick Frier who has ca&s;t off his Frock,
Squinting thro' a Micro&s;cope at a Wanton Nun; who
has thrown off her Petticoat. But Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is
mi&s;taken, if he thinks that to di&s;cern &s;ome certain
matters, he has need of a Magnifying Gla&s;s. He has
a Hawks, nay an Eagles Eye of his own at them;
<PB N="22" REF="24">
and I dare &s;ay, can &s;ee as clearly and as di&s;tinctly
through two Petticoats and a Smock, as <HI>Eu&s;tace
Cu$$ins,</HI> of Immortal Memory, could Swear through
a two Inch Board.</P>
<P>'Tis very true Sir, as I ob&s;erved before, that there
are &s;everal things in our Comedies, which I could
wi&s;h had been left out; and there are particularly
&s;ome Bawdy pa&s;&s;ages in them, which I wi&s;h the
Authors had had more re&s;pect for the Audience in
general, and for the fair Sex in particular, than
to have in&s;erted in them. But does he think
our Virtue &s;o very weak, either the Ladies or
the Gentlemen's, that we cannot give them a tran|&s;itory
hearing without being Debauch'd by them,
while his it &s;eems is &s;o very &s;trong, that he can
dwell for Months upon them, and make a full Col|lection
of them, a Collection which has taught &s;e|veral
of our Ladies more Bawdy in two Hours,
than they would have learn'd in &s;o many Years at
the Play-Hou&s;e? Does he believe that no body
ought to entertain them ob&s;cenely but him&s;elf? Or
does he pretend to Erect a Monopoly for Bawdy;
to retail it to his Stationers as oft as his occa&s;ions
require? 'Tis true, there are Corruptions which
have crept into our Theatres, and the&s;e Corrupti|ons
ought to be Reformed, but therefore ought the
Stage to be ruin'd? Is not the Corruption of the
Stage an evident proof of its Original Goodne&s;s,
&s;ince what is Originally Wicked never can be Cor|rupted?
But in what Human Conver&s;ation is there
not Corruption?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">
Does Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> really believe that there is no
Swearing in Gaming-Hou&s;es? No Intriegues at <HI>India</HI>
or Chocolate-Hou&s;es? No Lying, and no Sharping in
Coffee-Hou&s;es, no Bea&s;tly Leudne&s;s at Mu&s;ick-Hou&s;es,
and Bawdy-Hou&s;es? If he believes that the&s;e Places
are Guilty of the Crimes imputed to them, Why
does he not Preach to them, which have a great
deal more occa&s;ion for Reformation than the Play-Hou&s;e?
For in mo&s;t of them you have Venom
without Pre&s;ervative, but the Play-Hou&s;e carries or
&s;hould carry the Antidote with the Poi&s;on. If Mr.
<HI>Collier</HI> has &s;een any of the&s;e places, as 'tis hard to
believe that one of his Experience &s;hould not have
been at &s;ome of them; methinks he &s;hould be con|vinc'd
that by correcting of them, he would begin
with the Head, whereas now he but plea&s;es and tickles
Corruption, by catching Reformation by the Tail.
A little common Sen&s;e may &s;erve to convince a
Man, that the Reforming the Stage would never
Reform the Town, but the Reforming the Town
would certainly Reform the Stage.</P>
<P>What is the Rea&s;on then that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> neglect|ing
the Vices of the Town, keeps &s;uch a Bu&s;tle at
tho&s;e of the Stage. Why becau&s;e it is not his de&s;ign
or bu&s;ine&s;s to Correct or Reform any thing? His
only bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;et up him&s;elf. To erect an ob|&s;cure
Schi&s;matical Par&s;on into a Saint of the fir&s;t
Magnitude. To pa&s;s for a Man of more Sanctity
than all the Bi&s;hops, and of more Di&s;cernment than
all the Mini&s;ters of State. His bu&s;ine&s;s is not to Cor|rect
and Reform, but to amu&s;e, to puzzle, to make a
Noi&s;e and a Party; to make the Stage the Apple of
Di&s;&s;ention, to &s;et us at untimely Variance at this
<PB N="24" REF="26">
dangerous Juncture. He has Experience enough of
the World, to know that a Noi&s;e and a Party is
not to be made, by barely attacking of Vice. For
by doing that he would oblige only the Vertuous.
And alas they are but few; and a Silent, a Mode&s;t
and an Humble Party. But by attacking the Stage, he
obliges the Vitious too, and they are Numerous, and Pert,
and Arrogant, and Noi&s;ie and Tumultuous. 'Tis
true, the Virtuous are Enemies to the Vices and
Corruptions of the Stage. But only the Guilty and
the Hypocrites are Enemies to a Stage Reform'd,
becau&s;e a Stage Reform'd would be Enemies only to
them. When Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> began to Write his &s;hort
View, he de&s;igned to oblige only the fir&s;t, for in the
beginning of that Book, his intent is plainly only to
Reform the Stage. But then afterwards he Wi&s;ely
con&s;idered that the obliging the Virtuous would not
do his bu&s;ine&s;s. They are not enough to cry up their
Champion, and bring him into Reputation. But if
he appear'd an Enemy to the Stage it &s;elf, and at|tempted
to De&s;troy it in&s;tead of Reforming it, Why
then he would oblige all the Doubty Hectors in Vir|tue,
a numerous multitude of fal&s;e Branes, who would
infallibly &s;tand Buff for him, and be his Bully Backs
on occa&s;ion. He knew of old the Catalogue of
tho&s;e who were Enemies to Satyr, and he knew
that all the Enemies to Satyr, were &s;o to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Stage.</P>

<P>The Fir&s;t is he, <HI>Qui ob avaritiam laborat.</HI> A Gogling, Snarling,
Groaning, Praying Rogue; though at the &s;ame time an U&s;urer and
an Extortioner, a Fellow &s;o notoriou&s;ly given to cheating, that he

<P>The other Sir, is he; <HI>Qui mutat merces, &amp;c.</HI> A Biggotted Stock-Jobber,
or a Fanatick Monopolizer, a Fellow that devoutly calls
<PB N="26" REF="28">
up his Family to Repetition on Sundays; and as devoutly makes
them his Tools to Smuggle and Cheat the Queen on the Week-Days.
A Per&s;on who will &s;tick at no manner of Villany, but is kind|lycontented
to be damn'd, only that his great Boobily Boy, may
get half a dozen Claps, half a &s;core Surfeits, lo&s;e half his E&s;tate at
the Groom-Porters, be cheated of the other half by Sharpers who
are under Spur-Leathers; and Jog on to the Devil a little more gay|ly
than his Father. In the mean time this good natur'd Father a leads
mo&s;t Exemplary Life. In the Morning while his Servants are
bu&s;ie at the Water &s;ide, he walks about the City, to pull down
Play Bills, Cheat tho&s;e who deal with him, to cau&s;e all the Beggars
that he finds in his way to be Whipt; though at that very time he is
going to augment the Number of them, to vi&s;it Watch-Men, Head-Boroughs,
and Petty Con&s;tables, and charge them that if they find
any Hand&s;ome Whore upon their Watch, they &s;hould bring her to
him the next Morning; and lea&s;t the Con&s;table or the Watch &s;hould
have a wambling to her them&s;elves, for &s;uch things he remembers
have been formerly done, he reads a long Lecture to them again&s;t
Concupi&s;ence, and then goes Home, and gravely Dines with his
Family. The Afternoon he pa&s;&s;es in walking from Tavern to Ta|vern,
in which he Drinks above Twenty Nipperkins, in as many
several Kitchens, to &s;ee that there is no Swearing, and no Prophane|ne&s;s
there, but that People as he thinks it behoves good Chri&s;tians,
get Devoutly and Religiou&s;ly Drunk; till growing more and more
inflam'd with Canary and Zeal, and being full of them both, he is
obliged at the la&s;t to Di&s;embogue him&s;elf, which he does of each,
by Spewing and Preaching in turns. And after he has thus performed
his Duty to the Publick; and Fortified him&s;elf for the better per|formance
of private Duties, he goes home like a Good Man, to Fa&s;t and
Pray with his Family; I &s;ay to Fa&s;t Sir, not out of Covetou&s;|ne&s;s
or Super&s;tition, but that he may &s;ecure the Cha&s;tity of his
Daughters by mortifying the Old Man in them, and the Youths of
his Family.</P>
<P>But Sir, by your &s;haking your Head; and your biting your Lip,
I am to believe you mi&s;take me. I am not here for making a Satyr
upon the City. I know very well that this City is the only true and
<PB N="27" REF="29">
&s;olid Foundation of the <HI>English</HI> Strength. Nor am I &s;uch a Fool as
to believe that Sen&s;e or Honour are confined to place. I am my self
acquainted with a great many Citizens, who are very E&s;timable
Members of the Commonwealth; I know &s;everal among them who
are not only Men of Sen&s;e and Honour, but of Wit and Plea&s;antry.
I know &s;everal of them, who&s;e true Zeal for Religion, is &s;hewn by
all that engaging Charity, that atractive Humility, and lovely Meek
ne&s;s, which are the only &s;igns of a good Chri&s;tian. And for &s;uch true
Chri&s;tians whether they may belong to the Church or Meeting-Hou&s;e,
no Man has a greater re&s;pect than I have; who Judge of Mens
Devotion, not by the Errors of their Under&s;tandings, but by the
Sincerity of their Hearts. But every Hypocrite, to talk in Mr. <HI>Colliers</HI>
extraordinary Dialect, is the Di&s;plea&s;ure and the Di&s;ea&s;e of my
Eyes. I Hunt him, as <HI>Boileau</HI> &s;ays, as a Dog does his Game, and
as &s;oon as ever I &s;mell him, I bark immediately. And with &s;ubmissi|on
to you Sir, I believe I am in the Right of it, and that the Hypo|crites
in Chri&s;tian Warfare, ought to be more &s;everely handled, than
a Strumpet or a Libertine, as we treat an open declar'd Enemy le&s;s
rigorou&s;ly than a Spy. That the number of Hypocrites in the City
is very great, the Men of true Devotion there will be the fir&s;t to ac|knowledge.
'Tis to the Level of them that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> has particu|larly
Writ: Every thing in his &s;hort View, his Defence and his
Di&s;&s;wa&s;ive appears to be adapted to them; the Sophi&s;try of his De|ductions,
the Equivocating and Prevaricating of his Citations, the
Finialne&s;s of his Language, and the Phari&s;aical Arrogance of his
Zeal. By gaining of the&s;e he knew he &s;hould compa&s;s both the ends,
for the which he Writ. The fir&s;t of which was that he &s;hould engage
a numerous Party to make a Noi&s;e and to Bully for him; of which
he did not fail.</P>
<P>For is it notoriou&s;ly known that in the late Reign, &s;everal Per|&s;ons
of the foremention'd Stamp, who pretended to meet together
for the &s;upport of the Laws and the Government, di&s;charg'd their
Malice in a publick manner again&s;t &s;everal Gentlemen, of known
Loyalty and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Principles; only that they might do an accept|able
thing to a Man whom they knew to be a Mortal Enemy to
the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">
The other end that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> probably propos'd to him&s;elf, by
exa&s;perating the Noi&s;ie and Clamorous part of the City again&s;t the
Theatres, might be to Animate them again&s;t the People of Quality,
who&s;e pre&s;ence &s;upports them, and the Court who&s;e Authority pro|tects
them. That that this is no Chimerical Conjecture, may be
thought by any one who takes a &s;hort view of Mr. <HI>Colliers</HI> Prin|ciples.
For from this proceeding he might ea&s;ily for&s;ee one of the&s;e
two Con&s;equences. For upon the&s;e Clamours and Outcries, either
the Play-Hou&s;es would be &s;uppre&s;s'd, or they would be protected.
If they were &s;uppre&s;s'd, he ea&s;ily &s;aw the Gentry would be di&s;o|flig'd,
and that would be a pretty hand&s;ome &s;teptowards &s;ome far|ther
Reformations, and Alterations. But if upon the&s;e Clamours
they were not &s;uppre&s;s'd, why then he had a great deal of Rea&s;on
to hope that the City would grow &s;ullen and &s;ower. And if their be|ing
out of Humour was of &s;uch dangerous Con&s;equence in the Days
of Brother <HI>Pryn</HI> of ble&s;&s;ed Memory; when the Court appeared to
have &s;o little occa&s;ion for them, he believ'd that it might be of greater
Moment now, when he knew that by the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Times,
the Court was oblig'd to Demand their a&s;&s;i&s;tance frequently.</P>
<P>Sir, you have often told me with extream goodne&s;s, that you re|quir'd
no Obedience to any Commands that you laid upon us, if
they did not appear to be Rea&s;onable; Becau&s;e, God him&s;elf, you
have been plea&s;ed to tell us, required only our Rea&s;onable Service.
But Sir, Can you believe it Rea&s;onable, that I &s;hould be of another
Man's Opinion again&s;t my own Sentiments, when it appears &s;o
plainly that he is not of his own? For Sir, Can any thing be more
evident than that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is moved to Write again&s;t the Stage
by another Motive than that which he pretends. His Motive per|haps
may be Human Policy, but it can never be Charity, or perhaps
'tis Spleen or Covetou&s;ne&s;s, or Pride, or Arrogance, or Fear. I &s;ay,
Fear Sir. For has not Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> Rea&s;on to apprehend the Stage as
well as Hypocrites of the foremention'd Characters? For is it not
evident, that at the &s;ame time that he is &s;etting up for a Fir&s;t Rate
Reformer, he has &s;hewn to the World, that he is but a Fifth-Rate
Comedian? And while he pretends to condemn Acting upon the
Stage, is Acting a Part upon the Stage of the World, &s;o awkardly
<PB N="29" REF="31">
and &s;o ridicuou&s;ly, that all who are furni&s;h'd with Common Sen&s;e, have
found it to be Comedy? For whom he does he pretend to Reform? Is
it not the People, as I ob&s;erv'd before, who&s;e Religion he abhors, and
and who&s;e Government he hates? And does not he know very well that
by Reforming our Manners, he would run Counter to his own De&s;igns
and Wi&s;hes; becau&s;e Reformation of Manners would confirm the pre&s;ent
E&s;tabli&s;hment, both in Church and State? and can he then really de&s;ign
to Reform us? But how does he propo&s;e to him&s;elf, to bring this about?
Why not by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Vice, but the Stage that Scourges and expo&s;es it.
For he meddles not with that Vice that is the World, let it be never &s;o
<HI>flaming and outragious.</HI> For example, the crying Sin of <HI>England</HI> next to Hy|pocri&s;ie,
at this time is Gaming; a Sin that is attended with &s;everal others,
both among Men and Women, as Lying, Swearing, Perjury, Fraud, Quar|rels,
Murders Fornication, Ad$ltery. Has not Gaming done more mi&s;|chief
in <HI>England</HI> within the&s;e la&s;t Five Years than the Stage has done in
Fifty? For when Women have lo&s;t va&s;t Summs at Play, which they have
been afraid to own to their Fathers or Husbands, Have they not often
been known to pay them after a &s;hameful way? How can the mo&s;t In|veterate
Biggot pretend that Gaming is fomented or encouraged by the
Stage? Mu&s;t he not on the contrary he oblig'd to own, that it is Cen&s;ur'd
and Corrected by it? What is the Rea&s;on then that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> neglect|ing
&s;o Important and &s;o Dangerous a Vice, again&s;t which no body has
&s;aid one Word; re&s;erves all his Rage for the Play-Hou&s;e? And takes an
occa&s;ion from the late Tempe&s;t to threaten us with &s;ome Terrible Ven|geance
from Heaven, if it is not immediately &s;uppre&s;t. Can any thing be
more ridiculous than this from him? For does not he wi&s;h for the great|e&s;t
Vengeance that Heaven can &s;end down upon us? Can any Vengeance
be inflicted on a Prote&s;tant and free People more terrible than Slavery and
Idolatry? Is not the late Tempe&s;t, though dreadful in it &s;elf, yet a very
trifle compared to tho&s;e? Tho' the late Storm &s;hould return, <HI>and nature
&s;hould once more appear to be in her la&s;t Agony, and the World be Ready to ex|pire;</HI>
would not every one, who has Noble <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Principles, chu&s;e rather
to &s;ee it Peri&s;h, than to lo&s;e his Religion and his Liberty? Be&s;ides, Has
the late Tempe&s;tany thing to do with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Play-Hou&s;e? What
can Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> mean then by threatning us with terrible Vengeance, at
the &s;ame time that he wi&s;hes it; and by engaging us in frivilous and
groundle&s;s Di&s;&s;entions, endeavours all that he can to bring it on us at the
very time that he pretends to avert it?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Collier's</HI> Zeal were &s;incere; he would neither go about to frighten
us with things, which it is plain that he is not afraid of; nor neglecting
more dangerous Crimes would he attack the le&s;s. Be&s;ides it is plain that
he him&s;elf has not that Opinion of the Stage, into which he would Fool
<PB N="30" REF="32">
and Delude us. For if the cau&s;e of the Stage were &s;o bad as he would
make us believe; or if it were out of Charity that he attack'd it, What
need he make u&s;e of notorious fal&s;hood to decry it? 'Tis a plea&s;ant Cha|rity
that engages a Man to be damn'd him&s;elf to Reform others. Be&s;ides,
What occa&s;ion has Truth to have recour&s;e to Fal&s;hood, which may &s;ome|times
indeed &s;upport Fal&s;hood, but mu&s;t always to di&s;cerning Eyes ren|der
Truth &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>You know Sir, that it is ea&s;ie for me to prove, that in this &s;hort Let|ter
addre&s;t to you Mr. <HI>Collier,</HI> has recour&s;e to Fal&s;hood. For can any
thing be more plain, even from the Artifice of his Addre&s;s to you? Does
not he here, to make the World believe, thot he has the <HI>Countenance of
Figure and Fortune,</HI> Palm you upon the Town for a Per&s;on of Quality,
who are only a p$ivate Gentleman?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is mov'd by Charity to exclaim thus loudly again&s;t the
Stage, let me ask him one Que&s;tion, Who are the Per&s;ons whom he de|&s;igns
to Reform? They who never come to a Play-Hou&s;e, methinks &s;hould
have no occa&s;ion for his Corrections. If his De&s;ign is on tho&s;e who come
thither; Why does he not in&s;inuate him&s;elf into their Affections, by the
Meekne&s;s and Humility of his Expre&s;&s;ions, and the Atractive Language
of Charity? Why has he recour&s;e to &s;uch Pre&s;umptuous Arrogance, as
ju&s;tly renders him the Aver&s;ion of &s;ome, and the Scorn of others? with
him an Audience which you very well knew Sir, is often one of the mo&s;t
Venerable and Awful A&s;&s;emblies that can be any where found, is an A&s;|&s;embly
of Rakes and Strumpets; Buffoons are the Poets, and the Players
Libertines; Does he believe that &s;uch Language is proper to work upon
the&s;e People; or to provoke them and exa&s;perate them, and render
them deaf to Argument or Per&s;wa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides there is &s;omething in Mr. <HI>Collicers</HI> Style with which Truth is al|mo&s;t
incompatible, and that is Affectation, which is always fal&s;e. Truth
is plain and &s;imple, and natural, and as &s;he can have no defect in her is
but hid by Ornament. 'Tis true when we convey her to the Under&s;tand|ing
by the Pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;ometimes give her Ornament. But then that Or|nament
mu&s;t be in nature and con&s;equently true. But Affectations always
fal&s;e and can no more con&s;i&s;t with truth than darkne&s;s can with light.
What I have ob&s;erved of Man in general, my be &s;aid of Writers; That
Affectation is a certain &s;ign in them of want of Sincerity, or of Under|&s;tanding,
and very often of both.</P>
<P>But Mr <HI>Collier</HI>'s is the mo&s;t affected, mo&s;t Foppi&s;h Style that ever I met
with in Ancient or Modern Authors; of which I will undertake to con|vince
any Impartial Man, if he is but a tolerable judge of writing.</P>
<P>But to return from Words to Things, I have not time enough to di&s;|play
the perpetual Sophi&s;try of his Inferences, or rather his no Inferences,
<PB N="31" REF="33">
for a Metaphor or an Allegory is with him an Argument, and &s;o is often
an Hyperbole. But I &s;hall &s;ay a word of the more than Je&s;uitical preva|ricating
in his Authorities. I &s;hall only in&s;i&s;t upon too, the one of which
he brings from Old, and the other from Modern <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Pray Sir, Let me &s;ee Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>'s Letter; Ay, here the Authorities are.</P>
<P>The Republick of <HI>Rome,</HI> before <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;topt the building of a Theatre,
being fully convinc'd, that this diver&s;ion would bring in Foreign Vice, that the
old <HI>Roman</HI> Virtue would be lo&s;t, and the Spirits of the People Ema&s;culated.</P>
<P>To prove this he refers his Reader to his Defence of the Short View.
That is, he endeavours to &s;upport the Sham which he puts upon the World
now, by that which he put upon it five Years ago. 'Tis true after all, Mr.
<HI>Collier</HI> &s;peaks the Truth here, but 'tis da&s;h'd and brew'd with a Vengeance.
'Tis true, the <HI>Romans</HI> did &s;top the building of a Theatre, before the Time
of <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> But would he pa&s;s this upon us for one Act of the <HI>Roman</HI> Peo|ple,
or for their con&s;tant Sen&s;e? If for their con&s;tant Sen&s;e, their con&s;tant
practi&s;e proves that it was quite contrary. If for one Act, of what validity
can that po&s;&s;ibly be again&s;t their con&s;tant Sen&s;e?</P>
<P>Is not Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> now a mo&s;t &s;hameful Hyocrite? For does not he know
that the <HI>Romans</HI> had the highe&s;t veneration for Plays imaginable? Is not
every School-Boy, who has read <HI>Terence</HI> convinc'd of it? Do not his Co|medies
tell us by their Titles that they were part of the Religion of that
People? That they were all acted at their Funeral Ceremonies, or at the
Fe&s;tivals of their Gods?</P>
<P>That which he has &s;aid of Q <HI>Elizabeth</HI> is another Pious F$aud, a meer
Religious Banter. But I know that you who are &s;o well acquainted with
the Hi&s;tory of our Nation mu&s;t be already &s;atisfied of it.</P>
<P>But the Pope has lately &s;hut up the Theatres in <HI>Italy?</HI> Can any thing
be more ab&s;urd than this? Has the Pope lately &s;hut up the Bawdy-Hou&s;es?
Or does he continue to lay a Tax upon Sin, and to give them Spiritual
Licen&s;es? 'Tis very certain he does. What then would Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> conclude
from this; that the Government here ought to Licen&s;e Bawdy-Hou&s;es,
and to Suppre&s;s Play-Hou&s;es, becau&s;e the Pope takes the fame Method?</P>
<P>I think Sir, I have made it plainly appear, that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is one who
has Rea&s;on to be afraid of Theatres, and therefore to hate them. For he
is one of tho&s;e with a Vengance who endeavour to appear what they are
not. And tho' now a Days a Prie&s;t is not &s;uffer'd to be brought upon the
Stage, yet I que&s;tion whether he is to be regarded as a Prie&s;t, who wears
a Sword of five Foot long, and a Perruke of three, and goes about Re|forming
in the &s;ame Habit, in which the <HI>French</HI> Dragoons are at this very
Juncture Piou&s;ly Reforming the <HI>Cevennois.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Sir, I de&s;ire that I may have leave to continue to be a Friend to
our Theatres, &s;ince I have clearly &s;hewn that Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> is not from his
<PB N="32" REF="34">
Heart their Enemy; e&s;pecially &s;ince I am convinc'd that the Play-Hou&s;es
with all their Immorality and with all their faults, may be in&s;trumental
to the Reforming &s;o Profligate an Age as this.</P>
<P>Thus Doctor, I have &s;ent the &s;umm of the Objections which were
made by <HI>Charles,</HI> to which I de&s;ire your An&s;wer, that the Boy who is
Hot, and Opinionated, may not run on in his Error.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had done, I took <HI>Harriet</HI> to task, Daughter &s;aid I, You
&s;ee the Ca&s;e is very hard upon you and the re&s;t of your Sex, for thus the
Doctor puts it, <HI>Either the Ladies are pleas'd with the Indecencies of the Stage
or they are not. If they are pleas'd, 'tis a hard Imputation on their Virtue. If they
are not plea&s;ed, 'twill be enquired why they come there.</HI> For his part, <HI>He con|fe&s;&s;es
that he has not Logick enough to di&s;engage you.</HI></P>
<P>While I &s;poke this, I perceived &s;ome great alteration in her; you would
have &s;worm, <HI>her Imagination had been &s;hock'd, her Aver&s;ion put into a fit, and
that &s;he underwent much Fatigue of Fancy and Mortification.</HI> To &s;peak more
vulgarly, the Blood began to &s;pring up into her Face, her little Brea&s;ts be|gan
to heave, and &s;he darted a frown that made her awful ev'n to me her
Father. He wants Logick to di&s;engage us, (&s;aid &s;he, with a di&s;dainful
Air, after I had ju&s;t repeated tho&s;e very Words,) why, then he &s;hall find
that I have more than he has, and that I who have not yet reach'd my
Seventeenth Year, am able to make a very ju&s;t Apology in behalf of my
&s;elf, and all the Women of Condition in <HI>England,</HI> whom he has &s;o ba&s;ely
affronted. Tho' we are not pleas'd with the Indecencies or Immoralities
of Plays, yet notwith&s;tanding that we frequent them, becau&s;e &s;ome Di|ver&s;ion
is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us, and becau&s;e perhaps ev'n Modern
Plays with all the faults imputed to them, are the mo&s;t Innocent of the
Diver&s;ions which this Town affords.</P>
<P>The Diver&s;ions that the Town affords, are chiefly reduc'd to four, 1.
Gaming. 2. Mu&s;ick-Meetings. 3. Balls and Meetings for Dancing. 4. Go|ing
to Plays. Now of all the&s;e, I am apt to believe that Plays are the mo&s;t
Innocent, for the following Rea&s;ons. They rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions only to cor|rect
them, whereas the others rai&s;e'em merely for the &s;ake of inflaming 'em.
The Plays, and more e&s;pecially Tragedies in&s;truct us in Virtue, which the
other Diver&s;ions do not. They improve us in Lawful Innocent Knowledge,
which in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upplies the want of Education in our Sex. They
form our Language, and poli&s;h our Minds, and &s;o Capacitate us, when we
come to Marry to engage and endear our Husbands to us. For we every
Day &s;ee that only Fools are con&s;tant long to Fools. Sir, in &s;hort the
Ca&s;e is thus. Diver&s;ions the Ladies of a great Metropolis mu&s;t have. I
have particulariz'd the &s;everal Diver&s;ions which this Town affords. All
the Danger, and all the Temptation which this Judicious Per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;es
to be at the Play-Hou&s;e, are really in all the other Diver&s;ions, which have
<PB N="33" REF="35">
none of the advantages that may be reap'd from Tragedies, for the Im|provement
either of our Virtue or Knowledge. Why then would this
mighty Reformer have us leave Plays for them? Would he have us have
no Diver&s;ion, or would he have us make choice of tho&s;e which have the
mo&s;t Temptation?</P>
<P>True Sir, there are pa&s;&s;ages in &s;ome of our Plays which I could heartily
wi&s;h were out. But does he think the Virtue of the Ladies who frequent
Play-Hou&s;es, is &s;o very weak, as to be o'erthrown by the Lu&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, as
he calls it, of a Scriblers <HI>Double Entendres.</HI> What have &s;o many great Ex|amples
as we find on the Stage, &s;o many Noble and Generous Sentiments,
&s;o many accompli&s;h'd patterns of Virtue; Have all the&s;e no manner of
pow'r to rouze, to &s;trengthen and inflame our Virtue; and &s;hall two or
three wretched Equivocalls, three or four mi&s;erable <HI>Double Entendres</HI>
have the force to corrupt us?</P>
<P>If any of my Sex happen to find them&s;elves &s;o infirm, as this worthy
Reformer appears to own that he is; if two or three ridiculous double
meanings have &s;trength enough to undo them, in &s;pight of tho&s;e exalted
Heroick Characters, which in my Opinion &s;hould be enough to fix our
Affections on Virtue to that degree, that nothing that we meet with abroad
in the World &s;hould have the pow'r to move us; if any of my Sex are &s;o
infirm, let them in God's name keep away from our Theatres. But I find
no &s;uch &s;candalous weakne&s;s about me. I can de&s;pi&s;e a Fool who thinks
to entertain me with his &s;ordid playing on Words, but at the &s;ame time
can be entertain'd with Wit and good Sen&s;e, and more with the Innocence
of true writ Humour, and I can be both pleas'd and mov'd, with the ex|cellent
Scenes of an In&s;tructive Tragedy: Does this Judicious Per&s;on
really believe that the Conver&s;ations which we find in the World are
Virtue and Purity all. The Food of the Mind like that of the Body is not all
of it fit for Nouri&s;hment. But &s;trong Virtue like &s;trong Nature knows how to
di&s;cern and &s;eparate, toreject the bad, to a&s;&s;imulate the good by which it is
fed and &s;upported. If any of my Sex have the &s;candalous weakne&s;s to have
their Virtue and their Honour endanger'd by the Folly of <HI>Double Enten|dres,</HI>
I would advi&s;e them to take their leaves of the Play-Hou&s;e. But at
the &s;ame time I would advi&s;e Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> to per&s;wade his Noble Patrons
of the Reforming Club, to erect a Prote&s;tant Nunnery for them, for no|thing
le&s;s can &s;ecure them. For they who are found &s;o &s;trangely weak as
to be warm'd by a meer Painted Fire, How can they ever &s;tand again&s;t
the real Flames of Love?</P>
<P>How many extraordinary Women may <HI>England</HI> boa&s;t of, &s;ince Plays
were introduc'd among us? Among whom are three of the greate&s;t Queens
that ever the World produc'd; and all of them took Delight in Plays: How
<PB N="34" REF="36">
many Ladies of Inferiour Rank have frequented, and &s;till frequent 'em,
who yet in proportion are fam'd for every Virtue. What does this Cha|$table
Per&s;on believe of our Mothers, our Aunts and Grandmothers?
Does he believe them Adultre&s;&s;es all becau&s;e they frequented the Play-|Hou&s;e?
But you Sir have Ju&s;tice to believe better. You knew my Mo|$er
true to your Bed, as &s;he was dear to your Arms. And I be&s;eech you
to have the goodne&s;s to believe, that tho' like her I frequent our Theatres,
I will be always Heir to her Virtue, as I am to her likene&s;s.</P>
<P>This Doctor was the &s;um of what <HI>Harriet</HI> &s;aid before &s;he went to the
Play. News is ju&s;t now brought me that &s;he is come back from that hor|rid
place, and is gone with <HI>Charles</HI> to my Lady <HI>Freeloves,</HI> and that her
lady&s;hip has &s;ent for me&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah dear Doctor, Let me &s;ee you to morrow, to receive &s;ome Con&s;o|lation
from you. For here have happen'd two of the mo&s;t unfortunate
things in the World. For News is brought me from <HI>Piccadilly</HI> that <HI>Jack</HI>
has lo&s;t a Thou&s;and Pound at Picket, and <HI>Su&s;an</HI> who went into the Gar|den
for&s;ooth to Meditate, tho' &s;he went out as black as a Raven, being in
Mourning for her Great Aunt, yet as I hope for Mercy the Jade is return'd
as white and as powder'd, as if &s;he had been hard at work in a Bolting-|Hou&s;e.
So that I could wi&s;h that for this one Night, they had both been
with <HI>Harriet</HI> and with <HI>Charles</HI> at the Tabernacle of the Wicked.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, Dear Doctor, Yours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></CLOSER>

<P>SINCE I writ this, I have &s;een a Letter written by you, tho' with|out
Name to <HI>Mrs</HI>&mdash;She de&s;igns to return you an An&s;wer, as &s;oon
as &s;ome little Affairs will give her leave. In the mean while &s;he &s;ays, that
in the hurry in which your Letter &s;eems to be Writ, you overlook'd the
Fir&s;t part of the Pa&s;&s;age which you quoted from Doctor <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> and
therefore &s;he de&s;ir'd me to Tran&s;cribe it, and to &s;end it you with this,
which in Obedience to her Commands I have done, and it is as follows,
<HI>Tillot. Serm.</HI> vol. 11. <HI>To &s;peak again&s;t them</HI> (viz. <HI>Plays</HI>) <HI>in general, may be
thought too Severe, and that which the pre&s;ent Age cannot &s;o well brook, and
would not perhaps be &s;o ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, becau&s;e it is very po&s;&s;ible they might
be &s;o fram'd, and governed by &s;uch rules, as not only to be innocently divert|ing,
but in&s;tructing and u&s;eful; to put &s;ome Vices and Follies out of Counte|nance,
which cannot perhaps be &s;o decently reprov'd, nor &s;o effectually expos'd
and corrected any other way.</HI></P>
