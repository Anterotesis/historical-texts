<P>THE liberal manner in which a variety of materials for this work have been contributed, demands the author's earlie&s;t and mo&s;t grateful acknowledge|ments. He begs leave, with great re&s;pect, to confe&s;s the honour he received by the bi&s;hop of Durham's permi&s;&s;ion to tran&s;cribe, in the office of his auditor, tho&s;e valuable records hitherto with-held from the public, the DOOMSDAY BOOK of the county, called <HI>Boldon Buke</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This book is kept in the Auditor's Office at Durham: It is a &s;mall folio, con&s;i&s;ting of 24 pages, wrote in a bad hand, about the year 1183, by order of bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey; relates only to the bi&s;hop's deme&s;nes, or the villainage tenures; and takes no notice of the barons, or tenants <HI>in capite.</HI> This book has been always reckoned of great value and curio&s;ity, and admitted &s;everal times as evidence in the courts of law at Dur|ham. There is a neat tran&s;cript of it in the Chapter library at Durham, made by Chri&s;t. Hunter, M. D. and another is extant in the Bodleian library at Oxford (LAUD l. 52), being a thin quarto, con&s;i&s;ting of 23 clo&s;ely written paper leaves, and has once belonged to bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall, who&s;e name, CUTHBERTUS DU|NELM. E. written as it &s;eems by his own hand, is at the bottom of the fir&s;t page: It is wrote in a &s;mall neat hand, about the age of Henry IV. The cover has been blue velvet, and in the in&s;ide has the following title, "Boldon Book&mdash;<HI>Inqui&s;itio de Con&s;uetudinibus et Redditibus totius Epi&s;copatus Dunelmen&s;is, facta per Hugonem Epi&s;copum anno</HI> 1183."</NOTE>, and bi&s;hop Hatfield's Survey, &s;o material to this work in the elucidation of ancient tenures and &s;ervices.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE human genius knows not a nobler effort than that of collecting the various events of di&s;tant times, and placing them in &s;uch &s;ucce&s;&s;ive order and arrangement, as to exhibit a perfect delineation of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of &s;tates, the civilization of mankind, and advances of &s;cience. By the labours of the hi&s;torian are tran&s;mitted the great vici&s;&s;itudes which have attended on human affairs, and the knowledge of tho&s;e principles which influenced the pro&s;perity, as well as decline of empires; from which affecting examples, wi&s;dom forms her noble&s;t precepts. In &s;uch a review we become intere&s;ted in the fate of the &s;everal per&s;onages, who fir&s;t attempted to relea&s;e mankind from darkne&s;s and barbari&s;m, and our hearts participate the joy of tho&s;e, who&s;e wi&s;dom tamed the ferocity of &s;avage habits, and cultivated the human mind in the &s;chool of &s;cience and the liberal arts.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t through oral tradition alone intere&s;ting events were communicated, hi&s;tory was dark and uncertain; affected by the fortunes of men, and &s;uffering mutilation by the fall of &s;tates, much ob&s;curity frequently enveloped the mo&s;t important changes; for before the invention of letters, public monuments were the chief means of &s;aving the greate&s;t atchievements of nations, and the mo&s;t wonderful acts of providential interpo&s;ition from oblivion.</P>
<PB N="ii" REF="8">
<P>To &s;uch we are obliged to re&s;ort, when we di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e di&s;tant aeras, in which letters did not prevail, or in countries where they had not acceptation.</P>
<P>The work of the hi&s;torian, in the fir&s;t ages of literature, was laborious and unplea&s;ant; much depending on the uncertain definition of emblematical images, and my&s;terious traditions; whil&s;t a retro&s;pection through uncultivated ages, with the progre&s;s of ignorant and uncivilized nations, furni&s;hed di&s;agree|able &s;cenes. It is &s;ome happine&s;s to us, that compa&s;&s;ionate angels have with|held the humiliating picture from our eyes.</P>
<P>A multitude of records lies before me for the pre&s;ent work: It is a field in which I am the fir&s;t adventurer:&mdash;The toil of arranging &s;uch a chaos of ma|terials, will, I flatter my&s;elf, prevail with every liberal mind to overlook errors and inadvertencies, into which I may have fallen. So far as progre&s;s is made, I have at lea&s;t opened the pa&s;&s;age to &s;ome abler pen, that may perfect the work.</P>
<P>The ri&s;e and advancement of this opulent Bi&s;hoprick, and the original &s;tate of the Palatinate, require my attention, before I proceed to a de&s;cription of the country, or the hi&s;tory of its particular members. To that end it is nece&s;&s;ary to look back into antiquity, and to gather up from their ob&s;curity the con|&s;tituent parts, which have formed this powerful Principality.</P>
<P>The Roman writers inform us, that this was part of the province of the <HI>Bri|gantes.</HI> Little information is gained from them, as to the manners of the na|tives, their interior police, or public character. What they furni&s;h, is chiefly a &s;uperficial relation, that they were a brave, hardy and adventurous people, were led to battle by an elected chieftain, and &s;truggled long again&s;t the progre&s;s of conque&s;t; in&s;omuch that it was not 'till near the 80th year of the Chri&s;tian aera, that they &s;ubmitted to the Roman arms: They were e&s;teemed the brave&s;t race of Britons, and con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e heroes who would not &s;ubmit to the invaders as they advanced in conque&s;t, but with a true patriotic virtue &s;trove to retain their native liberty.</P>
<P>We have no authorities from whence to form a conclu&s;ion, by what people or from what region, this part of Britain fir&s;t received its inhabitants: Its vicinity to the German &s;hores, and &s;ome &s;triking &s;imilarities in ancient cu&s;toms, habits and religion, render it probable that many &s;ettlers came originally from thence, of the Celtae or Gauls. The Romans indeed tell us, that the few who under&s;tood the tillage of lands, dwelt near the &s;hores, and brought the practice from Germany. It would be an impertinent and u&s;ele&s;s labour to encumber the work with enquiries on this head, or attempt to gather up into one point of view, the various &s;entiments of the learned on the &s;ubject: It mu&s;t &s;uffice, that the inhabitants of this di&s;trict, on the acce&s;&s;ion of the Romans, were the Brigantes. The Ottadini held the territories north of Tyne, bordering on the German ocean; and the Gadeni the mountainous di&s;trict to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>The civil juri&s;diction of the Druids, and their principles of religion, univer|&s;ally prevailed over this i&s;land. They held the &s;upreme judicature, not under any e&s;tabli&s;hed code of laws, but on equitable principles; matters of right, and complaints of injuries being determined by &s;uch &s;en&s;e as the a&s;&s;embled dele|gates
<PB N="iii" REF="9">entertained of impartial ju&s;tice; and on di&s;cordance of opinion in the congre&s;s, appeal was made to the Arch-Druid, who&s;e &s;entence was final. The ceremonies of their religion were few, and much after the manner of the ancient Hebrews; they wor&s;hipped on high places, and in &s;olemn groves; they were not addicted to idolatry, but adored the God of nature, and rendered him prai&s;es on the annual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ea&s;ons, which they kept as &s;olemn fe&s;tivals: They &s;eem to have practi&s;ed little prie&s;tcraft, and held not the igno|rance of their adherents in the bonds of &s;uper&s;tition. Their moral rules were deduced from experience in &s;ocial life, and their acts of piety attributed to obvious cau&s;es in the events of providence; which was of all others the mo&s;t ea&s;y means of calling up the conviction and devotion of ignorant minds. In their civil government we hear of no puni&s;hments but two; for crimes of a lower ca&s;t, the offender was prohibited joining in public wor&s;hip, and ex|communicated from benefits civil and religious: In this &s;tate, he was as <HI>Cain,</HI> an outca&s;t before heaven and before men, being deprived of &s;ociety, and all its comforts: For crimes of the mo&s;t atrocious kind, the offender was &s;acrificed to the attribute of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> with all the &s;olemnity human art could devi&s;e, to render the example tremendous to the &s;pectator.</P>
<P>Their monuments which remain to us from the de&s;troying hand of the Romans, who were a&s;&s;iduous to efface every memorial of them, are of two kinds; one peculiarly adapted to religious offices and contemplations, &s;ur|rounded with groves; the other con&s;i&s;ting of a va&s;t circle of large &s;tones, with a column of &s;uperior height &s;eparated from the ring, together with an altar. Tho&s;e are with the greate&s;t probability conjectured to have been their courts of judicature; each large &s;tone in the circle, like the memorials of the Hebrews, at the pa&s;s of Jordan, appertaining to a di&s;tinct divi&s;ion of the people, who were amenable to that a&s;&s;embly, and where the delegate took his &s;tation at the time of convocation. Their a&s;&s;emblies were opened with &s;olemn rites of religion, and therefore the altar was prepared; where if no &s;acrifice was made, perhaps the &s;acred fire, as an emblem of the divine pre&s;ence, blazed with odoriferous woods. The column was the awful type of ju&s;tice, and the place where the criminal &s;uffered death.</P>
<P>The my&s;teries of their religion were not committed to writing, to prevent &s;chi&s;ms and divi&s;ions; their maxims of ju&s;tice were taught orally, to take away from the people all po&s;&s;ibility of chicanery and innovation. The &s;ons of chief per&s;onages were di&s;ciples in their ethic &s;chool, where the rules of moral life were inculcated as the grounds of human wi&s;dom. They &s;tudied medicine, and in the virtues of plants, of which Mi&s;letoe was their chief &s;pecific, their whole knowledge of pharmacy con&s;i&s;ted. By rea&s;on of &s;everal ancient gems, which have been di&s;covered, and attributed to the Druids, they have been charged with &s;uper&s;tition, as u&s;ing divinations and charms; but the&s;e, when impartially examined, were no other than amulets or religious trinkets, repre&s;enting the grand attributes of the Divinity, his wi&s;dom, eternity, and univer&s;al love.&mdash;In the ea&s;tern nations the &s;erpent
<PB N="iv" REF="10">was u&s;ed emblematically, and the Druids borrowed it, mo&s;t probably, from emigrants, who &s;pread into Germany, and perhaps cro&s;&s;ed the Channel: And there is little doubt, from their great affection to the emblems of eternity, that their faith extended to a future &s;tate, and perhaps they had &s;ome idea of the immortality of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch authority, the Britons had no want of regal power; except in times of war, and public calamity, when a chieftain was elected: The &s;ove|reigns tran&s;mitted to us by hi&s;torians, only figured during &s;uch conflicts and critical conjunctures.</P>
<P>When they became intimately connected with the Roman invaders, inter|married with them, and were both as one people, they deviated from the purity of their religion by adopting the polythei&s;m of the Romans. The Brigantes had their peculiar gods, or perhaps conceived images expre&s;&s;ive of the attributes of the Deity they had anciently wor&s;hipped; of which we find two memorials, Brigantia and Belatucader; and of the&s;e I &s;hall give the opinion of learned antiquaries in my notes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Gale's Manu&s;cripts: A Letter from Sir John Clerk to Roger Gale, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> concerning a Roman &s;tatue of Dea Brigantia, found at Middleby, in Annandale, in July, 1731.
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had written to you &s;ooner, but that you told me you was to go into York&s;hire for &s;ix weeks. I hope this will find you &s;afely returned, and the inclo&s;ed will divert you a little. Tho&s;e &s;tones are in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, &s;o you may believe the draught I have &s;ent you is exact. They were found in July la&s;t, in a camp which Mr Gordon mentions in his Itin. p. 18. I have &s;ent my Lord Pembroke a draught of them, but if he hears perhaps that any body but him&s;elf has them, he will not be plea&s;ed: In the mean while you may make what u&s;e you plea&s;e of the inclo&s;ed de&s;cription, that is, if you think proper you may give it either to the Secretary of the Royal or Antiquarian Society; but fir&s;t I beg it of you to correct every thing you think ami&s;s in it.</P>
<P>The &s;tone No. 1. has on it the repre&s;entation of a human figure, in ba&s;s relief, which is dre&s;&s;ed in a long robe, with a crown or diadem on its head, a globe in the left hand, and a &s;pear in the right, a head or medal hangs at the brea&s;t, and below at the left foot is a &s;hield, at the right foot a round cap, and under the feet is this in&s;cription:
<LIST>
<ITEM>BRIGANTIAE. S. AMANDVS</ITEM>
<ITEM>ARCITECTVS. EX. IMPERIO. IMP. I.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The reading of which I take to be, <HI>Brigantiae &s;acrum,</HI> or perhaps <HI>&s;acellum, Amandus Arcitectus ex imperio Imperatoris. Amandus</HI> is a name common in in&s;criptions, <HI>[&s;ee Gruter]</HI> and there is mention of one of this name in <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> much about the time of <HI>Julian:</HI> In the word <HI>Arcitectus</HI> the A is defaced, and an H is wanting, but it &s;eems to denote the trade of <HI>Amandus,</HI> to wit, an architect, &s;uch being common in tho&s;e days, &s;ee <HI>Not. Imp.</HI> toward the end, <HI>de corporibus Artificum:</HI> The la&s;t word <HI>Imp.</HI> may be <HI>Imperatoris,</HI> or probably <HI>impen&s;is,</HI> but the fir&s;t is mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>The crown or diadem may be attributed to <HI>Julian,</HI> for with &s;uch the Roman emperors of the lower em|pire u&s;ed to be ornamented, wherefore <HI>Ba&s;ilius Seleuciae Epi&s;copus in Sermone I^o de Adam</HI> de&s;cribes their dia|dem in this manner, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and many of the emperors are repre&s;ented in their coins <HI>Capitibus radiatis.</HI> The globe and &s;pear may likewi&s;e be attributed to him; for there is a coin of one of his predece&s;&s;ors, <HI>Caracalla,</HI> in which, according to <HI>Vaillant,</HI> p. 264, there is <HI>Figura virilis nuda &s;tans dextra globum laeva ha&s;tam gerens;</HI> and he adds, <HI>Nulla e&s;t certior principis effigies quam periti gubernatoris, ut refert Plato in Politico, ideo Did. Julianus in nummis globum gerit &amp; rector orbis perhibetur.</HI> From this account of <HI>Vaillant</HI> as to <HI>Didius Julianus,</HI> one might conjecture that this is a figure of <HI>Flavius Julianus,</HI> and the rather becau&s;e his name &s;eems to be mentioned on the altar, No. 2. (another piece of antiquity found at the &s;ame time) and the afore&s;aid <HI>Ba&s;ilius</HI> in the &s;ame place takes notice of this ornament in the hands of emperors.</P>
<P>Another conjecture may be, that this is a figure of <HI>Mercury,</HI> a favourite god of <HI>Flavius Julianus,</HI> to whom he u&s;ed &s;ometimes to &s;acrifice privately, though at that time by profe&s;&s;ion a Chri&s;tian. This appears from <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> lib. 16, ca. 5. <HI>Occulte Mercurio &s;upplicahat, quem mundi velociorem &s;en&s;um e&s;&s;e motum mentium &s;u&s;citantem theologicae prodidere doctrinae;</HI> and becau&s;e he is mentioned on both the &s;tones No. 2 and 3. But here there is no <HI>peta&s;us,</HI> no wings, no <HI>caduceus,</HI> no crook, no pur&s;e, nor other genuine marks, by which <HI>Mercury</HI> is commonly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>A third conjecture may be, that this is a figure of <HI>the country of the Brigantes</HI> in Britain, under the name of <HI>Brigantia,</HI> which <HI>Tacitus</HI> thus de&s;cribes in <HI>Vit. Agric.</HI> ca. 17. <HI>Brigantum civitatem quae numero&s;i&s;&s;ima pro|vinciae totius perhibetur.</HI> This is the more probable, becau&s;e the diadem &s;eems rather to be a <HI>corona muralis,</HI> as &s;ome of the Roman provinces are repre&s;ented in the <HI>Notitia Imperii,</HI> and becau&s;e the brea&s;ts are larger than they are commonly made in a male figure. Or it may be a repre&s;entation of <HI>Rome,</HI> becau&s;e of the globe, a mark of power and authority, which could not be &s;o properly a&s;cribed to the <HI>civitas Brigantum.</HI></P>
<P>A very learned gentleman, <HI>Mr Hor&s;ley,</HI> takes this figure to be a <HI>Pallas,</HI> and that the ornament hanging at her neck is the <HI>Gorgon,</HI> taken notice of by <HI>Virgil</HI> in his de&s;cription of this godde&s;s, lib. 8, v. 437.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;"ip &s;amque in pectore divae</L>
<L>"Gorgona defecto vertentem lumina collo."</L></Q>
<P>This I confe&s;s is &s;o probable a conjecture, that there is no way to evade it, except by &s;uppo&s;ing it may be one of tho&s;e ornaments which was found about eight years ago in this very place, viz. a gold medal of <HI>Con|&s;tantine,</HI> coined on one &s;ide, the other being plain, with a hole on the edge; by which it appeared to be a certain badge or ornament, which was u&s;ually worn in tho&s;e days by way of a <HI>bulla;</HI> for the <HI>imagines princi|pum,</HI> which were annexed to public papers, were of another kind. This medal is mentioned by <HI>Mr Gordon</HI> in his Itin. Sept. p. 18, and is now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Earl of Pembroke.</HI></P>
<P>One might &s;uppo&s;e this figure to be one of the&s;e <HI>Hermathenae</HI> mentioned in <HI>Cicero's Epi&s;t. prim. ad Atticum. Hermathena tua vald&egrave; me delectat et po&s;ita ita bell&egrave; e&s;t ut totum gymna&s;ium <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> videatur. Hermathena</HI> is a godde&s;s compo&s;ed of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Minerva.</HI></P>

<P>Tho&s;e &s;tones were found among the ruins of a building which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a temple.

<P>&startq;As to the figure and in&s;cription upon it, the image &s;eems to have been of that &s;ort which is called a <HI>Signum Pantheum,</HI> as repre&s;enting the &s;ymbols of &s;everal deities conjointly; by her habit, &s;pear, buckler, and Gorgon's head on her brea&s;t, &s;he bears a great re&s;emblance of <HI>Pallas:</HI> by the wings at her back, &s;he appears to be a <HI>Victory;</HI> the <HI>pileus</HI> at her feet denotes <HI>liberty,</HI> as does the <HI>globe</HI> in her left hand <HI>power</HI> and <HI>dominion,</HI> and the <HI>mural crown</HI> on her head <HI>defence</HI> and <HI>protection</HI> at home, or the de&s;truction of the enemies cities. The high opinion of her exten&s;ive abilities was, no doubt, the original of &s;o many attributes conferred on this godde&s;s by her adorers, as well as the gilding of the &s;tatue all over, as this was, when fir&s;t dug up, and before the gold was &s;coured off by the ignorant people, who fir&s;t got her into their hands. The in&s;cription tells us, &s;he was the godde&s;s or nymph <HI>Brigantia,</HI> a local or tutelar deity of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> as the <HI>Dea Roma</HI> was of Rome. We have other in&s;criptions in honour of her, as that in Selden, in Marm. Arundel, and another in Cambden, edit. Lond. 1695, p. 336, beginning

<P>It is not in the lea&s;t improbable, that when <HI>Julian</HI> came to be ma&s;ter of him&s;elf and the empire, and apo&s;tati&s;ed from the Chri&s;tian religion, he would encourage the Pagan wor&s;hip in this i&s;land, as well as other countries, and to that end e&s;tabli&s;h a college of the <HI>Dendrophori</HI> or <HI>Ligniferi,</HI> with other &s;uper&s;titions re&s;tored by him, and they to oblige the Emperor to erect a &s;tatue of his darling <HI>Mercury?</HI> And why might not the Emperor, to plea&s;e the province of the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> and ingratiate him&s;elf with them, give command to <HI>Amandus,</HI> his architect in the&s;e parts, to &s;et up this &s;tately image of their adored <HI>Brigantia,</HI> or to build a temple for her reception? &mdash; If &s;o, the la&s;t letters under this gilded figure may without force &endq;be interpreted IMP.

<P>I have the happine&s;s of yours of the 25th of la&s;t month, and am glad to be confirmed in &s;ome of my con|jectures, by your opinions which are &s;o well founded. That of the &s;tatue being a godde&s;s, under the name of <HI>Brigantia,</HI> is perfectly right. I took notice of this in the fir&s;t words of my paper, and &s;ince that time I ac|quainted you with my being a little better &s;atisfied in that notion; but &s;ince your la&s;t to me, and the rea&s;ons you give, I have no manner of doubt about this figure, and therefore I chearfully give up all manner of cou|jectures that differ with this. Be&s;ides the in&s;cription you mention, there is another in England to the DEAE NYMPH. BRIG. which is taken notice of in your father's book upon <HI>Antoninus's Journey,</HI> p. 53, publi&s;hed by you; and there are a va&s;t number of in&s;criptions to the local gods, every where to be met with abroad: As for the lady <HI>Brigantia,</HI> I confe&s;s I never met with her name, for hitherto I took the <HI>Nympha Brigantum</HI> to be &s;omething like the in&s;cription <HI>St Paul</HI> takes notice of at <HI>Athens,&mdash;to the unknown god.</HI> The crown on her head is vi&s;ibly now a <HI>corona muralis,</HI> with a kind of porch in the wall, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Since I was la&s;t to wait upon you, I received the inclo&s;ed from <HI>Mr Hor&s;ley</HI> which I take leave to &s;end you, in order to beg the favour of you to inform me, whether the copy you had from <HI>Baron Clerk</HI> differs in any re&s;pect from the reading of this; and as &s;ome doubts have occurred to my thoughts in relation both to the in&s;criptions and figure, you will permit me to take this opportunity of laying them before you:</P>
<P>I have &s;ome &s;u&s;picion about the word BRIGANTIAE, and if there was room for any conjecture, &s;hould imagine it might &s;ome-how be de&s;igned for BRIGANT DEAE or DIVAE. In the London edit. of <HI>Camden.</HI> 1695, p. 896, there is an in&s;cription that begins DEAE NYMPHAE BRIG. which part of it <HI>Mr Selden</HI> has in&s;erted in his edition of <HI>Marm. Arundeliana,</HI> vol. ii. p. 1477, and there is likewi&s;e in the &s;ame edition of Camden, p. 851, another in&s;cription DVI. CI. BRIG. and is there read <HI>Dui civitatas Brigantum.</HI> But if what appears now like DVI may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been at fir&s;t DIVAE, I &s;hould fancy both the&s;e in&s;criptions, as al&s;o this new one, may po&s;&s;ibly all refer to the &s;ame deity, without any particular name given to her. I am the more &s;u&s;picious that &s;ome of the letters in the word <HI>Brigantiae</HI> are ob&s;cure, becau&s;e a friend of mine &s;hewed me the other day a copy of the in&s;cription without the figure, which he borrowed of a gentle|man who lately brought it out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and told him it agreed with the fir&s;t draught which the <HI>Baron</HI> took of them; now in that copy the word is written BRIGANT. AE. If therefore what looks like a &s;mall I be only the remaining &s;troke of a D,<NOTE PLACE="inter">It is plainly TIE on the &s;tone, and therefore this is all &s;up|po&s;ition. R. G.</NOTE> it may originally have been for <HI>Deae,</HI> or DAE, for <HI>Divae;</HI> or if the la&s;t letter be a &s;ingle E, as in the new copy DE for Deae, for I find D. S. for <HI>Deus</HI> in <HI>Ni&s;atus.</HI></P>
<P>As to the figure, the wings, as you was plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve to me, plainly &s;hew it to be a <HI>Victory,</HI> and both the helmet and &s;hield at the feet, with the mural crown and laurels on the head, as al&s;o the globe in the left hand, &s;eem all to agree in repre&s;enting the happy effects of a victory. But the &s;pear in the right hand, with the &s;mall face at the brea&s;t, look to me like the &s;ymbols of <HI>Pallas,</HI> as they do to <HI>Mr Hor&s;ley,</HI> for there are &s;ome <HI>gorgons</HI> upon the brea&s;t of her images in <HI>Montfaucon</HI> much like this image; therefore it may be a &s;ort of compound image comprehending the &s;ymbols of both the deities, not unlike perhaps to the <HI>Pallas victrix</HI> mentioned in <HI>Gruter,</HI> who has an in&s;cription <HI>Pallad-victrici &s;acrum,</HI> p. 1077, 6; and this image is pretended to be &s;et up <HI>ex imperio,</HI> by a divine command, a thing not uncommon with the Romans, which might be fancied in a dream, and the form of it was very probably made according to the imaginary ap|pearance of the <HI>Dea Brigantum</HI> at that time, which might be that of a <HI>Pallas victrix</HI> with the&s;e &s;ymbols. The mo&s;t natural &s;en&s;e of the la&s;t letters IMP. &s;eems to be <HI>impen&s;a,</HI> but that would be more certain if <HI>&s;</HI> fol|lowed for <HI>&s;ua</HI> as u&s;ual.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The drawing, or rather &s;ketch, I now lay before you, was made from a Roman altar, lately dug up in the Vicar's garden, a <HI>Burgh on the Sands,</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the <HI>Axelodunum</HI> of the <HI>Notitia,</HI> but certainly was a Roman &s;tation, clo&s;e adjoining on <HI>Severus's</HI> wall. It is of a coar&s;e red &s;tone, adorned only with plain mouldings. The in&s;cription is complete, but the letters very rude and meanly cut, though very legible, con&s;i&s;ting but of two words, viz. DEO BELATUCA, which certainly &s;tands for <HI>Belatucadro,</HI> and I think the fifth in&s;cription which has been di&s;covered in Great-Britain addre&s;&s;ed to this local deity, for &s;uch I am inclined to pronounce it with <HI>Camden,</HI> and <HI>Gale,</HI> or at lea&s;t another name for <HI>Apollo,</HI> with <HI>Dr Ward,</HI> and not a cognomen of <HI>Mars,</HI> or another appellation of him, as has been conjectured.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in point of time, that has been di&s;covered, was in&s;cribed on an altar dug up at <HI>Elenborough,</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and &s;een by <HI>Mr Camden</HI> there, though now lo&s;t: It runs as in the mar|gin,<NOTE PLACE="inter">BELATV CADRO IVL. CI. VILIS. OPT. V. S. L. M.</NOTE> and where the word <HI>Belatucadro</HI> &s;tands &s;ingly, without the adjunct <HI>Deo.</HI> The &s;econd we have in the additions to the <HI>Britannia Rom.</HI> an altar &s;aid by <HI>Hor&s;ley</HI> to be now lo&s;t, though it was remaining at <HI>Netherby,</HI> a famous &s;tation in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> where it was dug up not many years &s;ince, and is as follows: DEO MARTI. BELATUCADRO. RO. VR. Here, &s;ays <HI>Mr Hor&s;ley,</HI> it is ju&s;tly remarked, that this in&s;cription argues <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Belatucader</HI> to be the &s;ame deity; but it is more ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed by <HI>Dr Ward,</HI> that the conjunctive <HI>et</HI> between <HI>Marti</HI> and <HI>Belatucadro</HI> was omitted by the tran&s;cribers, and con&s;equently they were two di&s;tinct deities. The third was an altar found al&s;o in this county, near <HI>Scaleby Ca&s;tle,</HI> and thus in&s;cribed: <HI>Mr Hor&s;ley</HI> in his remarks upon this in|&s;cription,<NOTE PLACE="inter">DEO. S. BE LATVCA ROAV. DO|VLLINVS V. S.</NOTE> declares his opinion very &s;trongly that <HI>Belatucader</HI> was a local deity; tho' afterwards, when he came to &s;peak of the <HI>Netherby</HI> altar above-mentioned, in&s;cribed <HI>Deo Marti Belatucadro,</HI> forgetting what he had urged a few pages before of <HI>Belatucader</HI> being a local deity, he concurs with the author of the additions to <HI>Camden,</HI> in pro|nouncing <HI>Belatucader</HI> a <HI>cognomen</HI> only of the god <HI>Mars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dr Ward</HI> litigates this notion very ably, and ob&s;erves from <HI>Selden</HI> and <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> that <HI>Belatucader</HI> was the &s;ame as <HI>Belenus,</HI> or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, whom both <HI>Herodian</HI> and <HI>Capitolinus</HI> affirm to be <HI>Apollo,</HI> who, it appears from <HI>Au&s;onius,</HI> was wor&s;hipped by the <HI>Druids. Dr Ward</HI> adds, "I cannot but incline to think, that this deity was <HI>Apollo,</HI> rather than <HI>Mars,</HI> both from the affinity of this name with other names of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and becau&s;e I do not find the epithet <HI>&s;anctus</HI> ever given to <HI>Mars,</HI> and here the in&s;cription runs <HI>Deo &s;ancto Belatucadro."</HI></P>
<P>The fourth was in&s;cribed al&s;o upon an altar found at <HI>Whelp Ca&s;tle,</HI> a famous Roman &s;tation in <HI>Kirkby Thore, We&s;tmoreland,</HI> and runs as in the margin.</P>
<P>This la&s;t corre&s;ponds exactly with mine,<NOTE PLACE="inter">DEO BELATVCAD RO. LIB. VOTV|M FECIT IOLVS.</NOTE> being addre&s;&s;ed &s;imply to the god <HI>Be|latucader (Deo Belatucadro.)</HI> Now as four out of five in&s;criptions, wherein <HI>Bela|tucader</HI> occurs, have no adjunct but <HI>Deo. Dr Ward's</HI> conjecture, that the <HI>et</HI> in the <HI>Netherby</HI> in&s;cription has been omitted by the tran&s;criber, is &s;trongly confirmed, and con&s;equently <HI>Belatucader</HI> was not a <HI>cognomen</HI> of <HI>Mars,</HI> but either a local deity wor&s;hiped by the Romani&s;ed Britons in this part of the province, or another name for <HI>Apollo.</HI></P>

<P>Something was &s;aid in the e&s;&s;ay on the coins of <HI>Cunobelin,</HI> p. 15, on <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI> a deity either of the Romani&s;ed Britons, or of the Romans re&s;ident in Britain; and it was there a&s;&s;erted he was the &s;ame with <HI>Mars,</HI> being e&s;teemed a local name of this deity. Since then an in&s;cription, accompanied with a memoir, has been produced by my late mo&s;t re&s;pectable friend <HI>Bi&s;hop Lyttleton,</HI> in which paper his Lord&s;hip, concurring with the late profe&s;&s;or <HI>Ward,</HI> reckons him to be a local deity, as do mo&s;t others, but with a reference to <HI>Apollo,</HI> who was wor&s;hipped, as they ob&s;erve, by the Druids. And herein they have on their &s;ide <HI>Sammes. Selden, Hearne, Montfaucon,</HI> and the Authors of the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory. Notwith&s;tanding the weight of all this authority, I &s;ee no rea&s;on to depart from my former a&s;&s;ertion, and hope I may &s;tand acquitted by the candid, if, in ju&s;tification thereof, I here re&s;ume the further con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, 'the God of War &s;eems to have had different names in various parts of the i&s;land; among&s;t the <HI>Trinobantes</HI> or <HI>Catuvellauni,</HI> to have been called <HI>Camulus;</HI> by the <HI>Brigantes, Belatucadrus;</HI> by the <HI>Coritani, Braciaca;</HI> and perhaps by others <HI>He&s;us,</HI> or <HI>E&s;us?</HI> Now all the five in&s;criptions yet di&s;covered concerning <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI> were found among&s;t the <HI>Brigantes;</HI> and the point to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed is, whether by this bar|barous title was intended a local deity, an&s;werable and equivalent to <HI>Apollo,</HI> or the god <HI>Mars,</HI> as <HI>Mr Baxter, Dr Gale, Mr Hor&s;ley</HI> in one place, and my&s;elf, have maintained.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who contend for <HI>Apollo,</HI> proceed upon the etymology; the application of the word <HI>&s;anctus,</HI> which they think becomes not <HI>Mars;</HI> and la&s;tly a &s;u&s;picion, that one of the in&s;criptions which runs <HI>Deo Marti Belatucadro</HI> is mi&s;written on the &s;tone, and was intended to be <HI>Deo Marti et Belatucadro.</HI></P>
<P>They think, in the fir&s;t place, they di&s;cover &s;omething of <HI>Belenus,</HI> or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the name of <HI>Apollo,</HI> in the term <HI>Belatucadrus.</HI> and &s;o <HI>Mr Hearne</HI> interprets it of <HI>Apollo Sagittarius,</HI> on account, I pre&s;ume, of the Greek word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. But &s;urely little &s;tre&s;s can be laid on this, &s;ince both <HI>Mr Baxter</HI> and <HI>Dr Gale</HI> have with equal, perhaps greater probability, deduced this name from the Briti&s;h, and have &s;hewn it may be a very proper adjunct to <HI>Mars.</HI> The fir&s;t analy&s;es it <HI>'Bel at u cadr</HI> quod e&s;t, <HI>Belus et arcem montis;'</HI> and the &s;econd writes, 'Po&s;|teriorque pars dictionis aliquid &s;pirat i&s;tius numinis (martis &s;cil.) cum <HI>Cad</HI> proelium, <HI>cader</HI> ca&s;trum, et <HI>cadr</HI> fortis <HI>Britannice</HI> &s;onent quae omnia Marti &s;atis congruunt.' In the next place, as to the application of the word <HI>&s;anctus</HI> to <HI>Belatucadrus, Mars</HI> was a natural divinity with the Britons and Romans; the founder of Rome, as was pretended, de&s;cended from him, and as the <HI>'Rex hominum et deorum'</HI> was with them <HI>Jupiter,</HI> &s;o the God of War was &s;tiled <HI>Mar&s;piter;</HI> and if <HI>Jupiter</HI> had his <HI>Flamen Dialis, Mars</HI> had his <HI>Flamen Martialis.</HI> The Britons, tho&s;e who were Romani&s;ed, we may be a&s;&s;ured, would adopt the like peculiar veneration for him. Be&s;ides, as <HI>Mars</HI> is &s;o currently &s;tiled <HI>Deus,</HI> where is the wonder that the term <HI>&s;anctus</HI> &s;hould be ap|plied to him? It is appo&s;ite to every one of the Pagan deities, every object of their wor&s;hip; for the Britons and Romans no doubt, e&s;t$emed their deities holy, whatever we may think of them; and <HI>Belatucadrus</HI> is ex|pre&s;sly &s;tiled <HI>Deus</HI> in four of the five in&s;criptions. But what comes nearer to the point, nobody ever doubted but <HI>Camulus</HI> was a name of <HI>Mars;</HI> and yet we have an in&s;cription in <HI>Gruter,</HI> which runs <HI>Camulo Deo &s;ancto et forti&s;&s;imo;</HI> which &s;hews plainly there is not the lea&s;t impropriety in giving the addition of <HI>&s;anctus</HI> to <HI>Mars</HI> or <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="inter">DEO SANG M ARTI, &amp;c.</NOTE> in our &s;tone. But what is &s;till more direct to the purpo&s;e, <HI>Mr Hor&s;ley,</HI> in Cumberland No. xxxv. has engraved a &s;tone as in the margin, which he reads mo&s;t properly <HI>Deo &s;ancto Marti. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems, la&s;tly, that nothing can be effected on their &s;ide of the que&s;tion, without a conjecture that a fault has been committed by the &s;tone-cutter, and that the in&s;cription was de&s;igned to have been <HI>Deo Marti et Belatucadro.</HI> This indeed is cutting the knot, but is doing at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t palpable violence to the authority and &s;anctity of the &s;tone. There is nothing more extraordinary in <HI>Deo Marti Belatucadro,</HI> than in <HI>Deo Marti Braciacae,</HI> as we have it in the <HI>Haddon</HI> in&s;cription, adduced in <HI>Camden.</HI> and the e&s;&s;ay on the coins of <HI>Cunobelin,</HI> p. 17, or <HI>Marti Camulo</HI> in <HI>Gruter</HI> and <HI>Mont&s;aucon.</HI> Now, upon this footing, viz. the integrity and correctne&s;s of the &s;tone, <HI>Mars</HI> is expre&s;sly called <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI> and this is admirably confirmed by the te&s;timony of <HI>Richard</HI> of <HI>Cirence&s;ler,</HI> p. 9, <HI>'Hinc Apollinem, Martem, qui etiam Vitucadrus appellehatur, Jovem Minervam&mdash;venerabantur, candem fere de his numinibus ac quidem aliae gentes opinionem amplexi?</HI> In&s;omuch that it &s;eems to me highly ab&s;urd to look out for any other deity in <HI>Belatucadrus,</HI> but the god <HI>Mars.</HI> That he was a local deity, peculiar in this i&s;land to the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> is not denied; but then we a&s;&s;ert him to be equivalent to <HI>Mars,</HI> and to have been inve&s;ted with the &s;ame powers as that God, and not to have had the lea&s;t concern with <HI>Apollo.</HI> or any relation to him, as his Lord&s;hip and Profe&s;&s;or Ward contend.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This altar was al&s;o &s;ince found at <HI>Plumpton,</HI> and communicated to the author by a gentleman of Cumberland. It is &s;till more cu|rious than the former, and probably from its mixed dedication, may draw &s;ome further opinions from antiquaries.</P>
<P>Dedications to the god <HI>Magon</HI> have been recovered in the Roman &s;tations in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> one in particular <HI>Mr Hor&s;ley</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Camden</HI> ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;es to have been erected to the topical god <HI>Magon,</HI> wor&s;hiped by the <HI>Cadeni</HI> or <HI>Gadeni,</HI> a neighbouring people of the <HI>Citadini.</HI> See a particular account of the&s;e in&s;criptions to the <HI>View of Northumberland,</HI> p. 181, &amp;c.</P></NOTE> The Gadeni, who occupied the high lands north of Tyne, had their Magon.</P>
<P>The garments of the Brigantes were like tho&s;e of the other northern Britons, rude and uncouth, and &s;eldom con&s;i&s;ted of more than the &s;kins of wolves, ca&s;t over the left &s;houlder, and girded on with leathern thongs. After navigation obtained among the Germans, and they had frequent intercour&s;e with this i&s;land, the Britons learned to manufacture wool, and the hair of goats, which at fir&s;t, with infinite toil, they beat and wrought together, forming a kind of felt, of which the mo&s;t opulent wore caps and ca&s;&s;ocks, or loo&s;e gowns, bound round the wai&s;t, with a belt. Their ornaments were barbarous as the times, large and cumbrous rings of iron, chains round the wai&s;t, heavy bands of bra&s;s
<PB N="v" REF="11">or copper as bracelets, on their legs and arms. When the Romans de&s;erted this i&s;land, the Britons are de&s;cribed as being ignorant of the art of working metals, and making arms; &s;o that their uncouth ornaments mu&s;t either have been procured from foreigners, or the people had forgot the art. The intercour&s;e with the Germans, who traded or pirated on our coa&s;ts, would introduce bra&s;s and iron in&s;truments for war; and tho&s;e &s;ettlers on the &s;hores, which the Ro|mans found practi&s;ing tillage, mu&s;t have brought with them many in&s;truments long afterwards unknown to the people who lived a Scythian life in the interior parts of the country, and for &s;ome ages refu&s;ed to commune with them. The ut|mo&s;t elegance of the Brigantian fa&s;hion is de&s;cribed in the dre&s;s of Boadicea, and part of that might be borrowed perhaps from the Romans: Her hair was of a deep yellow, a colour of &s;uch e&s;timation that dyes were u&s;ed to heighten it. This prince&s;s wore it very long, hanging down to the bottom of her back. Her neck was adorned with a ma&s;&s;y chain of gold, and &s;he was habited in a tunic interwoven with various colours, over which was a robe, of coar&s;er tex|ture, bound round her wai&s;t with a girdle, and fa&s;tened with buckles. The im|provements in dre&s;s need not be traced, as the Romans gradually introduced their own fa&s;hions; and as we hear of no linen in the dre&s;s of this prince&s;s, it is natural to conclude, it was then even unknown to the Brigantes.</P>
<PB N="vi" REF="12">
<P>Their chief &s;trength in the field was in their war-chariots, which they managed with great dexterity, driving them furiou&s;ly on the lines of the enemy, and turning them &s;wiftly on the beam, thereby charging and retreating with incredible rapidity. The wheels were armed with hooks, and the warriors di&s;charged their mi&s;&s;ive weapons from the carriage. At this mode of fighting they are repre&s;ented to have been &s;o expert, as &s;eldom to mi&s;s giving a mortal wound to the enemy. The body of the troops was armed with javelins and
<PB N="vii" REF="13">targets, &s;ome few but not till this time, with poignards, and others with heavy two-edged &s;words. They fought in a tumultuous manner, and both charged and retreated without order or dicipline.</P>
<P>Their permanent habitations were in the fore&s;ts, crowded together without order or regularity. The village, or rude a&s;&s;emblage of huts, was defended by a mound of loo&s;e &s;tones, piled up in a ridge, which was &s;trengthened by a ditch on the out&s;ide, and logs of timber heaped up in confu&s;ion, by way of barri|cado, formed the out-work. One of the&s;e fortifications in this county, &s;hall
<PB N="viii" REF="14">hereafter be de&s;cribed, the rampart of which it is not ea&s;y even at this day to climb. Their &s;ummer huts being erected for the convenience of pa&s;turage, con|&s;i&s;ted of a few poles, placed in a circular form, wattled with branches, and covered with turf.</P>
<P>So much it appears nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;aid of our Briti&s;h ance&s;tors. They who would examine more minutely into their life and manners, may re&s;ort to Tacitus, Diodorus Siculus, Cae&s;ar, Strabo, Tacitus, Herodian, and others of the ancients; or to Rowland's Mona Antiqua, Stukeley, Borla&s;e, Strutt, Dr Henry's Hi&s;tory of Britain, and many more of the moderns, who have drawn from the &s;ame &s;ources.</P>
<P>The Romans &s;eem to have been &s;atisfied with the &s;ubduction of the &s;outhern parts of Britain, until the reign of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, who &s;ent Petelis Cerialis to govern the province: He found that his predece&s;&s;ors, particularly Trebellius, had not exerted them&s;elves in making new conque&s;ts, but had contented them&s;elves with maintaining what had been previou&s;ly gained, and that too, by conciliating the minds of the natives to new modes of life, by which they were for a time lulled into pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But as the&s;e practices could contaminate
<PB N="ix" REF="15">only &s;uch as had an intimate intercour&s;e with the Romans, a dete&s;tation of bon|dage, and the innate love of liberty, broke out in many places at a di&s;tance from the Roman garri&s;ons, and &s;ecret cabals were held unnoticed by the incautious legions. In a life of inactivity and &s;oftne&s;s, the rigour of di&s;cipline being re|laxed, the Roman &s;oldiers gave into the mo&s;t dangerous innovations on duty, and were become almo&s;t ripe for revolt. Had the Britons &s;eized this propitious moment, they might perhaps have &s;haken off the yoke, and maintained their independency. For Caelius who commanded the 20th legion, entertaining a &s;trong antipathy to Trebellius, encouraged the &s;pirit of faction in the &s;oldiers, well knowing their particular attachment to him&s;elf, and at length a powerful party appeared in arms again&s;t their leader; but by means of early intelligence Trebellius had time to &s;ecure him&s;elf by flight. In his ab&s;ence Caelius a&s;&s;umed the chief command, and with a true military &s;pirit kept the province in good or|der. Trebellius, however had &s;ufficient intere&s;t at the Imperial Court to get him&s;elf re&s;tored, but &s;oon after fell into the &s;ame &s;tate of languor and inactivity, through which a total anarchy threatened the Roman affairs in Britain. Vitellius alarmed at &s;uch a critical &s;ituation, notwith&s;tanding the civil conflicts at Rome, with Ve&s;pa&s;ian, paid early attention to this important member of the empire,
<PB N="x" REF="16">and di&s;patched Bolanus, to take upon him the command. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of few mi|litary accompli&s;hments, but of a placid turn of mind, with manners highly po|li&s;hed, his endeavours &s;eem to have been to captivate the affections of the Britons. Such a conduct, tho' well adapted to poli&s;hed &s;tates, gave too much liberty to the turbulent minds of uncultivated men, to devi&s;e new projects, and conceal their &s;ecret machinations. At this time it was that Vitellius di&s;patched me&s;&s;en|gers to Britain, commanding a detachment from thence to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in Rome: Had this been complied with, the Britons would have again had a favourable opportunity to &s;hake off the yoke; but Bolanus, either from a &s;ecret attach|ment to Ve&s;pa&s;ian, or rather on account of the intelligence he had gained of the cabals in the interior parts of this i&s;land, returned for an&s;wer, that the turbulent and un&s;teady di&s;po&s;ition of the uncultivated natives, who &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the heights and natural &s;trong holds, was &s;uch, that with all the force he had, and the courte&s;y he exerci&s;ed, he was ju&s;t able to keep the province in peace; and that if any troops &s;hould be withdrawn, it would hazard the entire lo&s;s of a country won at the expence of &s;o much time, trea&s;ure, and blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>Ve&s;pa&s;ian's &s;ucce&s;s in the empire was &s;carce well e&s;tabli&s;hed, when he turned his thoughts upon this i&s;land. Adventurous and of a military ca&s;t of mind,
<PB N="xi" REF="17">his choice of officers was &s;uited to his own di&s;po&s;ition: He &s;ent Cerialis to take the command, who, in an ardour for honour, looked on the annals of his predece&s;&s;ors with contempt, e&s;timating their years of ea&s;e as lo&s;t to the &s;tate, regarding with jealou&s;y the un&s;ubdued and &s;avage nations in the northern parts of Britain, and determined to reap his laurels from their &s;ubjugation. Fraught with this idea, he brought the army under &s;trict di&s;cipline, and fortified the garri&s;ons with every military art: De&s;pi&s;ing meaner &s;tates, he made war upon the mo&s;t powerful. The Brigantes were his fir&s;t object. The petty &s;tates, regarding them as invincible, &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed at his teme|rity. Many bloody conflicts were the con&s;equence, in which regular order and dicipline in&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s to the Romans, and the greate&s;t part of the country &s;oon became abandoned to the victorious legions, who marked the progre&s;s of their conque&s;t with the mo&s;t horrid deva&s;tations.</P>
<P>The hi&s;torians who &s;peak of this time, do not allot to this &s;courge of the Brigantes above five years, for in the year 75 we find Julius Frontinus had the command, who, pur&s;uing the maxims of his predece&s;&s;or, carried his arms again&s;t the Silures.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by Julius Agricola, who had fought under the victorious Petilius Cerialis, and to who&s;e valour and wi&s;e conduct, much of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of Cerialis is attributed. Far from indulging in repo&s;e after his arrival, Tacicus &s;ays, he drew out his army, even after the decline of &s;ummer, and marched again&s;t the Ordovices, who, &s;ome &s;hort time before, had put to the &s;word a troop of hor&s;e, they had &s;urpri&s;ed. Not intimidated by this people keeping within their fortifications, in the bo&s;oms of intricate fore&s;ts, and &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="xii" REF="18">with mora&s;&s;es, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;trong holds on the lofty mountains, he pre&s;&s;ed his troops forward, encouraging them by his intrepid example, and di&s;gracing their fears by leading them to the charge in the mo&s;t adventurous attempts. He did not linger in the plains, making efforts to draw the enemy to open battle, but a&s;&s;ailed their intrenchments, and by mounting the ramparts of their &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es, taught the a&s;toni&s;hed foe to believe nothing was &s;uperior to Roman valour. Such was the effect of this intrepidity, and &s;uch the emulation his example in&s;pired, that his forces were invincible, and every place &s;ubmitted to his arms. And the campaign being over, we find him as great in the clo&s;et as in the field. He in&s;pected narrowly into the method of collecting the tribute, and corrected &s;uch abu&s;es as he di&s;covered whereby the Britons were oppre&s;&s;ed, and aboli&s;hed &s;undry grievous exactions, which had been impo&s;ed without authority. He in&s;pected all the public offices, and put the &s;everal &s;ervices, which the allied &s;tates were bound to perform, on a more liberal and equal plan. He had public days, on which he heard the complaints of all, and rewarded or puni&s;hed with impartiality, temperance and moderation: Such was his political conduct, that all whom he had &s;ubdued by his &s;word, were held in obedience by his mild and prudent admini&s;tration. Thus he employed the winter, and no &s;ooner was &s;ummer &s;et in, than he took the field, and by the rapid movements of his army, hara&s;&s;ed the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed multitudes who were &s;till in arms again&s;t him.&mdash;When an interval of peace permitted, he invited the chiefs of each friendly &s;tate to entertainments, and laboured ince&s;&s;antly to inculcate a love of the &s;ciences; in&s;inuated a ta&s;te for Roman elegance, built them man&s;ions and temples; introduced them to &s;hews, magni&s;icent &s;ports, and the pomp of religious ceremonies, and at length taught them a reli&s;h for modes of living, of which till then, they could form no conception: It was thus that the ferocity of the Britons was &s;ubdued, and it &s;oon became the fa&s;hion for young men of rank to be under the tuition of Roman preceptors, and to wear the Roman habit. And &s;uch was the good under&s;tanding that now obtained, that &s;everal &s;tates voluntarily &s;ubmitted, gave ho&s;tages for their fidelity, and a&s;&s;ented to fortre&s;&s;es being erected, and garri&s;oned with Roman &s;oldiers. Whether the Ottadini and Gadeni were of tho&s;e &s;tates that thus acceded; or whether the line of &s;tations from the ea&s;tern to the we&s;tern ocean, were tho&s;e mentioned by Tacitus, is no part of our inquiry; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that all that di&s;trict, which is the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent narrative, was in the year 80 under the admini&s;tration of Agricola; and it is not im|probable but from this great man's policy, many of tho&s;e cu&s;toms which &s;hew their remains at this day, were di&s;pen&s;ed to the people.</P>
<P>This di&s;trict was not in&s;ured of peace under the protection of the Roman arms; it was unhappy in its vicinity to the contentious northern tribes, who in roving bands, on every occa&s;ion, were giving di&s;turbance to the Roman government. The fortre&s;&s;es rai&s;ed by Agricola indeed, kept them in awe; and from the time that he was recalled from his government in the
<PB N="xiii" REF="19">year 85, to 117, hi&s;torians are &s;ilent as to Briti&s;h affairs; and it &s;eems pro|bable, that after the quiet and repo&s;e of the Brigantes under Agricola's admini|&s;tration, and the dreadful overthrow of the northern Britons on the Gram|pian hills, the mi&s;erable remains of the latter were not able to make any con&s;iderable head. But in the &s;pace of thirty years a new generation &s;uc|ceeded, tutored from their infancy to entertain an implacable hatred to the Roman name; and from their earlie&s;t years di&s;ciplined in acts of rapine and plun|der, as knowing few other means of procuring a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>For about the time that Hadrian &s;ucceeded to the empire, the&s;e re&s;tle&s;s tribes grew more formidable and adventrous; they made their appearance in large bodies, and drawing nearer the frontiers, occa&s;ioned &s;uch an alarm, that the province &s;olicited an immediate reinforcement from the continent. Julius Severus came over with &s;upplies, and by his vigorous mea&s;ures the banditti were &s;oon repre&s;&s;ed, and forced to &s;eek for &s;afety in their own barren and inho&s;pitable mountains.</P>
<P>It was unhappy for the Brigantes, and in a le&s;s degree for the more &s;outhern parts of Britain to have been infe&s;ted with the&s;e inroads of the northern tribes, who &s;eem to have been actuated by the &s;ame principle that induced the Scandinavians, and other northern nations, to quit a barren country, and wi&s;h for a &s;ettlement in a fertile one. Nor is it to be won|dered at, when, at this very day, when the whole i&s;land of Britain is united under the &s;ame government, we &s;ee that the inhabitants of the northern parts, when once they make a &s;ettlement in the &s;outhern, &s;eldom expre&s;s any de&s;ire of returning to their native country.</P>
<P>It would be an unintere&s;ting narrative to follow the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Roman commanders, and the various incidents which marked the &s;everal periods of their authority: The irruptions of the northern nations, and the repeated ravage and de&s;truction with which they marked their progre&s;s, would not appear &s;ufficiently momentous to excu&s;e to the reader, the repitition of hor|rid de&s;cription. As it was ob&s;erved before, this territory was &s;ubject to great jeopardy from its &s;ituation, and notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e augu&s;t works, the pretenturae of Hadrian and Severus, it &s;uffered repeated depredations. But the&s;e were not the only calamities of the Brigantes. For about the year 285, the Franks and Saxons infe&s;ted the coa&s;ts with innumerable barks, employed in pillage and every outrageous act of piracy. The Britons in their intercour&s;e with Gaul, had increa&s;ed their &s;hipping, and under the in&s;truc|tions of the Romans improving in the knowledge of navigation, carried on much intercour&s;e and trade with the oppo&s;ite &s;hores; &s;o that ho&s;tilities of this nature were a dreadful check to their growing commerce and improv|ing manufactures. The luxuries of life increa&s;ing, foreign articles grew into high e&s;timation, and the love of traffic advanced vigorou&s;ly: The fer|tility of Britain afforded a &s;taple of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the oppo&s;ite continent, and the mountains &s;upplied another; for their corn, cattle and wool, various commodities were received in exchange, and by the rapid in|crea&s;e
<PB N="xiv" REF="20">of their &s;hipping, the ballance of trade &s;eems to have been greatly in their favor.</P>
<P>Maximianus, who &s;hared the Imperial dignity with Diocle&s;ian, paid an early attention to this new grievance, and fitted out Carau&s;ius with a power|ful &s;leet to &s;cour the &s;eas. Hi&s;torians have imputed to his character a de|gree of treachery, which the future events of his life do not &s;eem to &s;up|port. He is &s;aid to have &s;tudied to enrich him&s;elf, and that he never at|tacked the pirates but on their return, that he might po&s;&s;e&s;s their booty. This accu&s;ation appears to have ari&s;en from envy; but yet &s;o powerfully was it repre&s;ented to Maximianus, that he i&s;&s;ued orders to put him to death. Carau&s;ius having intelligence of the de&s;truction decreed again&s;t him, called a council of the naval officers, who loved him for his bravery and generous &s;pirit, and repre&s;ented to them the inju&s;tice done his charcter, and the violence of the Emperor's &s;entence; on which they unanimou&s;ly joined him in a revolt, and the whole fleet making immediately for Britain, where he was equally beloved by the army, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be proclaimed Emperor. If he had been con&s;cious of the crime imputed to him; or if the Britons had &s;uffered by his avarice and mi&s;conduct, it is &s;carce probable he would have repaired to them to proclaim his intentions of &s;evering the pro|vince from the Imperial juri&s;diction, and of becoming him&s;elf the Emperor.</P>
<P>Maximianus &s;tartled at this audacious act, yet prudently weighing in his mind the &s;trength of Carau&s;ius, who had concluded a peace with the Saxons, and entered into an alliance with them, for a while put on a countenance of compliance, and confirmed him in his government of Britain with the title of Emperor. Thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, Carau&s;ius enjoyed his dignity for &s;ome years in peace; which time he &s;pent in &s;trengthening his frontiers again&s;t the northern nations, building new forts, and repairing the pretenturae of Hadrian. At the &s;ame time he was not negligent of his naval power; having di&s;covered the true &s;trength of the i&s;land, he kept his &s;hips in exerci&s;e, and encouraged trade as a nur&s;ery for his navy. Maximianus breathing ven|geance again&s;t him, and having increa&s;ed his navy, prepared to attack Bri|tain, under the conduct of Con&s;tantius Chlorus; but before this comman|der could leave the coa&s;ts of Gaul, Carau&s;ius was &s;lain at York by Alectus, whom he had con&s;idered as his intimate friend. It is not ea&s;y to account for the motive of the latter, but as he was &s;oon after proclaimed Carau&s;ius's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and as Con&s;tantius declined his purpo&s;e of invading Britain, it &s;eems as if Alectus was the in&s;trument of Maximianus's revenge.</P>
<P>From &s;ome &s;ucceeding circum&s;tances, it is probable the provincial Britons were much again&s;t this &s;everance from the empire, that they were not well affected either to Carau&s;ius or his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and that they dete&s;ted the al|liance with the Saxons, who had interfered with their navigation, and robbed them of the &s;weets of traffic with the continent. For Alectus had enjoyed his new dignities only about three years, when Con&s;tantius &s;et out on an ex|pedition to depo&s;e him. The events which en&s;ued were various, but Alectus
<PB N="xv" REF="21">falling in the field, they terminated at length to the honour of Con&s;tantius; who, through a &s;eries of fortunate circum&s;tances, re&s;tored peace to Britain, and reunited her to the empire, after a &s;everance of about ten years.&mdash; The Saxons, after the defeat of Alectus, attempted every &s;pecies of rapine and pillage; till being wor&s;ted in &s;everal conflicts, mo&s;t of them were put to the &s;word, or fled the land. The &s;eas now cleared of pirates, a free trade and &s;afe navigation were again opened; &s;o that the Britons con&s;idered Con&s;tantius as a guardian angel, and he was &s;o &s;incerely affected towards them, that upon the re&s;ignation of Diocle&s;ian and Maximianus, and the di|vi&s;ion of the empire between him&s;elf and Galerius, he cho&s;e to take up his re&s;idence among them; and died at York in 305, &s;oon after his return from a Caledonian expedition.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantinus &s;ucceeded his father, being his elde&s;t &s;on, by Helena, a native of Britain, a woman of ine&s;timable virtues: He reduced and brought to obe|dience the northern &s;tates; and under his government, Britain appears to have enjoyed great tranquility for upwards of thirty years.</P>
<P>Con&s;tans the &s;econd &s;on, having defeated his brother Con&s;tantinus, who made war upon him to gain the &s;hare of dominion allotted by his father, in the beginning of the year 343 vi&s;ited Britain, and repre&s;&s;ed the in&s;ur|gents in the north, who again infe&s;ted the frontiers. From the many vices he was a &s;lave to, and his exhau&s;ted revenues, he was urged to impo&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive exactions on his provinces, and Britain groaned under a heavy tribute; but it was of no long continuance, as he was &s;oon after depo&s;ed and &s;lain. Nor did Magnentius, whom the &s;oldiers cho&s;e for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, long enjoy his exaltation: Dreading the vengeance of Con&s;tantinus, brother to the depo&s;ed emperor, he fell upon his &s;word, at Lyons, and put an end to his life.</P>
<P>About the year 360 the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of Britain, from increa&s;ed com|merce, improved manufactures, and great influx of wealth, induced the northern tribes to a&s;&s;emble and make fre&s;h attacks; and &s;uch was their power, that they pa&s;&s;ed the pretenturae of Hadrian and Severus, and with a rapid cour&s;e advanced into the &s;outhern parts, reaping immen&s;e booty; &s;o that Julianus, the governor of Gaul, was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending over a body of forces under Lupinus; on who&s;e approach the&s;e northern plun|derers retired with precipitation. But this was a &s;hort re&s;pite, for in the year 364, immediately after Valentinian had a&s;&s;umed the purple, the northern tribes taking advantage of the perturbed &s;tate of the &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, occa&s;ioned by the plundering Saxons, appeared in greater num|bers than ever. For three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years they prevailed in &s;pite of the Roman arms, and advanced as far as London, before a &s;top was put to their career by Theodo&s;ius, whom Valentinian &s;ent over on this emergency. The deva&s;tation they had committed, and the de&s;olation with which they had marked their progre&s;s were tremendous. A bloody engagement en&s;ued, in which they were routed with va&s;t &s;laughter; the Roman general being
<PB N="xvi" REF="22">irritated to great &s;everities, mercy was extended to few; and the &s;poils with which they had enriched them&s;elves, were re&s;tored to the mi&s;erable inhabitants whom they had plundered. He pur&s;ued his victory with unre|mitting vengeance, and the &s;cattered remains of the enemy fled before him to the mountains. And having recovered the forts on the mo&s;t di&s;tant frontiers, he repaired them, and re&s;tored their military e&s;tabli&s;hments; the chain of &s;tations on the pretenturae of Hadrian and Severus he &s;trengthen|ed with new works, which having accompli&s;hed, he put the whole di&s;trict between the lines, under military orders, as a di&s;tinct province, to which he gave the name of Valentia. Tho&s;e things effected, he employed the hours of peace in re-edifying, or con&s;tructing forts in the mo&s;t needful &s;ituations, making great regulations in the army, and reforming &s;everal abu&s;es in go|vernment; e&s;pecially reducing the exactions under which the Britons were oppre&s;&s;ed, and re&s;toring the tribute to its original equality. His benevolence de&s;cended in the next place to private bounties; he relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; he rebuilt their man&s;ions, repaired their cities, added new works to their fortifications, paid the utmo&s;t attention to their ports and havens, reformed their &s;hipping with modern improvements, put their foreign traffic on the mo&s;t advantageous footing, and protected it with a powerful naval force. Such happy effects immediately &s;ucceeded his mea&s;ures, that the province re|a&s;&s;umed the countenance of opulence and felicity. Having accompli&s;hed tho&s;e great works, this guardian of Britain (from who&s;e wi&s;dom and excellent government more benefits were derived, than from any of his predece&s;&s;ors) returned to Rome, leaving an indelible affection in the hearts of the i&s;landers, with whom the name of Theodo&s;ius was held in univer&s;al veneration.&mdash; Peace for &s;everal years &s;ucceeded tho&s;e excellent e&s;tabli&s;hments. Military order &s;trictly maintained in the north, held the people in awe, and the naval force which the Provincials kept up, totally repre&s;&s;ed the Saxon pirates.</P>
<P>About the year 380, the Britons had the misfortune to embark in a de&s;tructive project: Pre&s;uming to &s;upport Maximus their governor, in his preten&s;ions to the empire, the flower of their youth were embodied in the army, with which he pa&s;&s;ed over into Gaul, determined to &s;hare in his am|bitious expectations. The con&s;equence was dreadful: His pur&s;uits were un|fortunate, and in his ruin were overwhelmed his Briti&s;h followers, who either falling by the &s;word, or becoming wanderers in a foreign country, never regained their native &s;hores. Drained of its &s;trength and wealth, Britain lay expo&s;ed to its watchful enemies, who in the year 393, availing them&s;elves of the public calamity, ravaged the northern parts; whil&s;t the Saxons di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the &s;outhern. Theodo&s;ius, &s;irnamed the Great, &s;on of the excellent patron of Britain, having attained the whole empire, by the death of his colleague Valentinian, &s;ent forces to their relief, and &s;oon re&s;tored peace.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding di&s;traction in the Roman &s;tate brought with it new mi&s;eries to the Britons: Various were their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, before Con&s;tantine, who was
<PB N="xvii" REF="23">elevated to the &s;ceptre from a low &s;tation, wrought the de&s;truction of this province, by enli&s;ting under his banner all the youth he could allure with vi&s;ions of glory, to participate his fortunes, The recent example of Maxi|mus and his retainers, had no influence on the minds of the people; but they were precipitated to their ruin, and compleated the wretchedne&s;s of their country, by an attachment to this adventurer, who&s;e early gleams of pro&s;perous fortune &s;oon for&s;ook him.</P>
<P>About the year 413 this i&s;land was de&s;erted of the Romans; Victorinus their general, with all the Imperial troops being withdrawn to &s;upport Honorius, and protect the remnant of the &s;haken empire from the univer&s;al wreck, which was threatened by &s;urrounding enemies. This was too favourable a moment for the re&s;tle&s;s northern tribes not to &s;ally forth from their hiding places, and make new inroads; to oppo&s;e which, Honorius being &s;olicited for &s;uccour, was under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hewing his own weakne&s;s, by de|claring it was not in his power to &s;end them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and renouncing all claim to their allegiance, he recommended to them to &s;hake off that &s;upinene&s;s, which had crept in upon them under the protection of Roman arms, to rea&s;&s;ume the courage of their ance&s;tors, and recover their &s;pirits from the depre&s;&s;ion which had overwhelmed them in the abjectne&s;s of va&s;&s;alage. Such exhortations had no other effect than to produce de|jection and de&s;pair. The few Romans who had made connections with them, and remained in Britain after the army was withdrawn, fore&s;eeing the de|&s;olation that was at hand, &s;old their effects, and departed the country, to &s;eek for &s;ecure habitations under &s;ome &s;ettled government.</P>
<P>Great was the mi&s;ery of the Britons at this cri&s;is! Swarms of hungry and in&s;atiable a&s;&s;ailants pouring forth from every quarter over the abandoned land, without mercy and de&s;perate from want! The mountains and the fore&s;ts &s;ent forth their tens of thou&s;ands, all eager for pillage, and anxious for revenge; for they regarded all within the Pretenturae as Romans, on account of their old attachment. The people thus invaded, bereft of their councellors and protectors, were agitated like the fore&s;t torn by tempe&s;ts; incon&s;tant in every re&s;olution, each in&s;table determination was revoked as &s;oon as formed; without money, without a leader, and without virtue and &s;trength of mind, from whence alone courage proceeds. In this deplorable &s;tate, they fell under the &s;word of their vindictive enemies, or fled before them in de&s;pair. Under &s;uch extreme calamity, they again di&s;patched me&s;|&s;engers to Rome, when Honorius &s;ent a legion to their relief, with who&s;e aid the foe was once more repre&s;&s;ed. This legion helped to repair the Pre|tenturae, and taught them various arts nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;afety and com|fort; in&s;tructing them in the general rules of architecture, fortification, and the di&s;po&s;itions to be practi&s;ed in the army; but particularly taught them the art of making arms and other in&s;truments of metal. The&s;e things per|formed, the victorious legion returned to Rome.</P>
<P>It was not long before the enemy appeared again, when they made a
<PB N="xviii" REF="24">breach in the northern wall, and advanced with their u&s;ual barbarity.&mdash;The little re&s;pite the Britons had enjoyed, only &s;erved to overwhelm them in a deeper dejection of &s;pirits: They neglected the means their own &s;trength offered, and again applied to Honorius, who &s;ent &s;uch forces to their relief, as gave a total overthrow to the ravagers. Satiated with &s;laughter, and willing to render the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed coun|try, they proceeded to repair the wall of Severus with firm ma&s;on-work, and re&s;tored the ramparts and outworks; and in order to &s;ecure the coa&s;ts again&s;t a foreign enemy, they a&s;&s;i&s;ted in building &s;everal &s;orts and &s;trong holds in the mo&s;t advantageous &s;ituations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been imagined that <HI>Bambrough</HI> in Northumberland was originally one of tho&s;e &s;orts, the ba&s;e of the pre&s;ent tower being of a very different mode of architecture from the &s;uper&s;tructure, and &s;uch as the Saxons or Normans did not u&s;e. It is Doric; but Mr <HI>Gro&s;e</HI> does not find any difficulty in admitting it might be the work of the Normans, as mo&s;t of their architects learned their art at Rome, and &s;hews an in&s;tance of the Ionic order being followed in part of their edifices at Canterbury. The reader will determine for him&s;elf in this matter; it is known, that the Ro|mans erected <HI>nine</HI> forts of this kind on the more &s;outhern coa&s;ts of Britain: The &s;econd detach|ment of Honorius re&s;tored the wall of Severus with ma&s;on-work, and perhaps might build the tower of Bambrough &s;imilar to the nine before mentioned, the better to &s;ecure the northern terri|tories again&s;t the German rovers who infe&s;ted the coa&s;t. At lea&s;t the Doric order appearing here, and in no other Norman tower in the north, where &s;everal &s;till remain, it gives a probability that the original &s;tructure at Bambrough was Roman. The Notitia Imperii, cap. 52, points out the <HI>nine</HI> &s;orts, but takes no notice of this, nor was it to be expected if we date this edifice in the time of Honorius. Many of the northern &s;tations, who&s;e remains are yet to be &s;een, are not to be found in the Notitia.</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e things being accompli&s;hed, the Roman General bid adieu to Britain; but before his departure, exhorted the inhabitants to u&s;e their utmo&s;t ef|forts for the defence of their country, <Q>You are neither (&s;ays he) inferior in &startq;mu&s;cular &s;trength or &s;tature, to tho&s;e with whom you have to contend, nor are your endowments of mind of meaner quality; experience will teach you knowledge;&mdash;victory depends on your own virtue.&mdash;It is valour alone mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain you; and the force of arms mu&s;t be your &s;ecurity. You have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to fight for, the reward of which is &s;weeter than the fruits of rapine, and more to be de&s;ired.&mdash;With the advantage of &s;uch fortifications as we have left you, you are, if you u&s;e the means, much &s;u|perior &endq;to your foes.</Q></P>
<P>As the di&s;tracted &s;tate of the Empire had obliged Honorius to give up all preten&s;ions to &s;overeignty, &s;ome time before, &s;o now on the recall of his forces in the year 420, the Romans took a final leave of this i&s;land, ju&s;t 475 years after they had fir&s;t &s;et foot upon it: And as Chri&s;tianity had long been not only openly profe&s;&s;ed in mo&s;t of the capital cities of the Empire, but had for &s;ome time been under the protection of the civil magi&s;trate, even in the remoter provinces; it is natural to conclude it mu&s;t have made &s;ome progre&s;s in this i&s;land, not only by its own intrin&s;ic excellence, and the labours of tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioned to preach it, but al&s;o by that free and familiar intercour&s;e that had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, between the Britons and the Roman &s;oldiers, many of whom had fought under the banner of the cro&s;s. The reader will therefore, at this important period, expect &s;ome account of the &s;tate of <HI>Religion</HI> in Britain.</P>
<PB N="xix" REF="25">
<P>William of Malm&s;bury's account of Jo&s;eph of Aramathea vi&s;iting Britain, and founding the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian church at Gla&s;tonbury, has been de&s;ervedly rejected as fable. Eu&s;ebius who was pre&s;ent at the council of Nice, and was an hi&s;torian of &s;ome reputation, gives te&s;timony of the Chri&s;tian faith having gained a footing in Britain in a very early age of the church; and from him too we are told that &s;ome of the Apo&s;tles preached to the Britons, who are &s;poken of by Theodoret a bi&s;hop of the 5th century, as having been converted by St Paul. Clemens Romanus, a cotemporary with the Apo&s;tles, &s;ays, that St Paul preached to the utmo&s;t bounds to the we&s;t; which in the common language of the times, implied the Briti&s;h i&s;les.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ultimos orbis Britannos.&mdash;Horace.</NOTE>&mdash;But this phra&s;e may import, that the apo&s;tle &s;ent forth bi&s;hops to convert the people; and it is pre&s;umed by &s;ome writers, that the Chri&s;tian faith was promulgated, and many converts made before the defeat of Boadicea. Ari&s;tobulus a bi&s;hop ordained by St Paul, is &s;aid to have been a mi&s;&s;ionary in Britain, and to have &s;uffered martyrdom about the year 56. Tacitus tells us, <Q>That Pomponia Graecina, the wife of Aulus Plautius, the legate &startq;of Claudius, was accu&s;ed of foreign &s;uper&s;tition, and for which &s;he was &endq;tried for her life, &s;he having, as is a&s;&s;erted, embraced the Chri&s;tian faith.</Q></P>
<P>It has been conjectured, that Claudia mentioned by St Paul in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy, was the Briti&s;h lady, celebrated by the poet Martial, by the name of Claudia Rufina, the wife of Pudeus.</P>
<P>Tertullian who lived in the time of Caracalla, &s;ays, <Q>That Chri&s;tianity &startq;&endq;had made its way into Britain;</Q> and to name no more of the ancients, Origen, who died in the year 253, &s;ays in his 6th homily, <Q>The power &startq;of our Saviour's kingdom reached as far as Britain, which &s;eemed to lie &endq;in another divi&s;ion of the world.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et penitus toto divi&s;os orbe Britannos.&mdash;Virgil.</NOTE></P>
<P>To proceed to later authorities, Bede's words are,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Bede's Hi&s;t. cap. 4.</NOTE> <Q>In the year of our &startq;Lord 156, Marcus Aurelius Verus, the 14th emperor after Augu&s;tus, reigned with his brother Aurelius Commodus, as his colleague, in who&s;e time Eleutherius a godly man, was pope of the Roman church, Lucius king of Britain wrote to him, de&s;iring, under his direction he might be taught the principles of Chri&s;tianity; the holy father immediately complied with this pious reque&s;t, and the Britons then received the faith, and pre&s;erved the &endq;&s;ame in peace until the reign of Diocle&s;ian.</Q>&mdash;What authority this vener|able, but credulous hi&s;torian, had for this account of Lucius, it is now im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay. But that there once lived a prince of this name, and mo&s;t probably in this i&s;land, one may venture to pre&s;ume as well from the old book of Llandaff, as from two coins mentioned by Archbi&s;hop U&s;her, one &s;ilver and the other gold, the la&s;t of which was part of Sir Robert Cotton's collection, and examined by the primate, bearing the impre&s;s of
<PB N="xx" REF="26">cro&s;s, and that it was the king in que&s;tion, was concluded from the letters LVC.&mdash;Dr Stillingfleet was of opinion, that Lucius's kingdom was in Surry and Su&s;&s;ex.&mdash;Bauterne gives the print of another coin repre&s;enting a man's head, and on the rever&s;e a boar and a &s;tar, the in&s;cription LVCIO.</P>
<P>It is generally believed that no oppo&s;ition was made to the Chri&s;tian doctrine in Britain, from the period before mentioned, to the reign of Diocle&s;ian. This emperor jealous that the new faith would weaken his authority, publi&s;hed an edict in the year 303 for pulling down churches, and burning the holy &s;criptures, declaring, that no Chri&s;tian &s;hould be ca|pable of any office or po&s;t of honour; that they &s;hould be outlawed and deprived of the privilege of &s;uit; and that no rank or quality &s;hould ex|cu&s;e them from torture.&mdash;Con&s;tantius Chlorus was then governor of Britain, a favourer of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;pecially effected towards the Britons, yet under the directions of his &s;overeign, was obliged to put the edict in exe|cution; but in 305 becoming emperor him&s;elf, there was an end of the per&s;ecution. For a particular account of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians in Britain during this horrid period, the reader is referred to Gildas. Among the &s;everal martyrs were St Alban, Aaron, and Julius. Con&s;tantius encouraged the Briti&s;h Chri&s;tians to return from their places of concealment, permitted them to rebuild their churches, and renew their religious a&s;&s;emblies and ceremonies.</P>
<P>From the council of Arles it appears, that three Briti&s;h bi&s;hops &s;ub&s;cribed canons of that council, viz. Eborius of York, Re&s;titutus of London, and Adelfius of Lincoln. It al&s;o appears that the Bi&s;hop of Rome was not pre|&s;ent, but that the decrees were tran&s;mitted to him, with this addre&s;s, "to our dear brother the Bi&s;hop of Rome."</P>
<P>It does not appear that any Briti&s;h bi&s;hops were at the council of Nice, though at the council of Sardica in 347, they joined in full condemnation of the doctrine of Arius, on account of which the council of Nice had been &s;ummoned. It is ob&s;erved by mo&s;t writers on our eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, that at this council, the fir&s;t in&s;tance appears of the &s;upreme authority of Rome, to receive appeals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The motion made by Ho&s;ius, was to the following purport. <Q>If any bi&s;hop &s;hould conceive &startq;him&s;elf injured by the &s;entence of the neighbouring bi&s;hops, and de&s;ire to be reheard; if you plea&s;e, in re&s;pect to the memory of St Peter, let tho&s;e bi&s;hops who have pronounced judgment, write to Julius Bi&s;hop of Rome, and tran&s;mit a copy of their proceedings to him, and if he thinks it pro|per that the cau&s;e &s;hould be tried over again, let him a&s;&s;ign judges for that purpo&s;e: But if he is &s;atisfied with what is done, and declares again&s;t a rever&s;al, let his &s;entence &s;hall good and &endq;determine the point.</Q> To this the council replied,&mdash;"They were content."&mdash;<HI>Concil. Labbe Tom. u.</HI> p. 629, 645.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the year 359 at the council of Ariminum, the Briti&s;h bi&s;hops were pre&s;ent, and though this council was charged with favouring Ariani&s;m, yet St Hillary acquits the Briti&s;h prelates, and &s;ays, that a&s;&s;embling at Paris to|gether with the Gallican bi&s;hops, they prote&s;ted again&s;t the decrees of that council, and gave a confirmatory a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e of the council at Nice, and
<PB N="xxi" REF="27">he had al&s;o in his book, de Synodis, the year before born t&eacute;&s;timony to their orthodoxy. Three of the bi&s;hops were in &s;uch nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances, oc|ca&s;ioned perhaps by the incur&s;ions of the northern tribes, that they were &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for the time at the Emperor's expence.</P>
<P>Though the Briti&s;h prelates were at this time acknowledged to be or|thodox, yet Pelagiani&s;m, fir&s;t countenanced in Gaul, and from thence brought into Britain, made a rapid progre&s;s, and gave no little concern to the or|thodox. This, however, tells to the credit of the Britons, that they begun in this early period to think and enquire for them&s;elves. It would be tak|ing too great a liberty to a&s;&s;ert, that they readily imbibed the doctrine, becau&s;e Morgan, who took the name of Pelagius, being their countryman, was the founder of a &s;ect among&s;t them, who&s;e tenets were from him called Pelagiani&s;m; and which are &s;o well known that it would be an affront to the reader, to give them in detail. And it may be further ob&s;erved, that the right of private judgment &s;o far prevailed in behalf of Pelagius's tenets, that the Gallican bi&s;hops, alarmed at this innovation on what they e&s;teemed orthodoxy, &s;ent over Germanus and Lupus, as mi&s;&s;ionaries to re|claim the Pelagians, but what was their &s;ucce&s;s is uncertain.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t northern bi&s;hop named by hi&s;torians is St Ninian, who fixed his re&s;idence at Whithern in Galloway; which afterwards during the Saxon heptarchy, was a member of the kingdom of Northumberland. He is &s;aid to have con&s;ecrated &s;everal bi&s;hops, and divided that country into di&s;tricts and pari&s;hes.</P>

From whence it may be inferred, that all that has been wrote on many of the Engli&s;h laws being derived from &s;o early a period, as by &s;ome antiquarians is contended for, is at lea&s;t problematical.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone in his commentaries &s;ays, <Q>Our ancient lawyers (and particularly Forte&s;cue) in&s;i&s;t &startq;with abundance of warmth, that the&s;e cu&s;toms are as old as the primitive Britons, and continued down through the &s;everal mutations of government and inhabitants to the pre&s;ent time unchanged and unadulterated." This may be the ca&s;e, as to &s;ome, but in general, as Mr Sciden in his notes ob&s;erves, this a&s;&s;ertion mu&s;t be under&s;tood with many grains of allowance; and ought only to &s;ig|nify, as the truth &s;eems to be, that there never was any formal exchange of one &s;y&s;tem of laws for another; though doubtle&s;s by the intermixture of adventitious nations, the Romans, the Picts, the Saxons, the Danes and the Normans, they mu&s;t have in&s;en&s;ibly introduced and incorporated many of their own cu&s;toms with tho&s;e that were before e&s;tabli&s;hed; thereby in all probability im|proving the texture and wi&s;dom of the whole, by the accumulated wi&s;dom of divers particular countries.

And it &s;eems to have been not only with the con&s;ent of the Britons, but by expre&s;s invitation that the Saxons were to make &s;ettlements in the i&s;land, as it does not appear, that any other gratuity was &s;tipulated for their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The number that came over at fir&s;t is &s;aid to have been only 1500, and to have had the i&s;le of Jhanet allotted them. Whatever was their number, they are &s;aid to have performed very &s;ignal &s;ervices under Vortigern, whom the Britons, after the Roman mode of government had advanced to &s;overeignty. The northern invaders, having de&s;olated the country were attacked by Vortigern and his Saxon auxiliaries at Stamford, when a dreadful conflict en&s;ued, in which the the invaders were routed with great &s;laughter; their light arms could not bear up, again&s;t the bucklers, axes and &s;cymitars of the Saxons. By this victory, which was ju&s;tly attributed to the auxiliaries and wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ition of the array,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="29">the Britons were re&s;tored to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and many a mi&s;erable &s;ufferer was in &s;ome mea&s;ure recompen&s;ed for his lo&s;&s;es by the &s;poils which the di&s;per&s;ed and broken remains of the enemy left in the field.</P>
<P>Such was the joy of the Britons, and &s;uch their gratitude to their Saxon de|liverers, that it is no wonder they &s;hould expre&s;s it by the mo&s;t extravagant care&s;&s;es; nor that Vortigern &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e Rowena the daughter of Hengi&s;t one of the Saxon leaders, and make her partner of his throne; nor that this prince, depending on Saxon prowe&s;s, &s;hould invite additional numbers, and allot them a territory adjoining to the i&s;le of Thanet, the re&s;idence of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, per|haps all that is now called Kent; though it has been &s;aid by &s;ome authors, that that di&s;trict was granted to the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, as the &s;tipulated price of Rowena's beauty. Be this as it may, jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions breaking out in a little time between the Britons and their deliverers; and the latter preferring Britain to their own country, and &s;eeing how ea&s;ily they might make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it, now under the government of a prince, who&s;e vices and indolence rendered him un&s;it to govern at all, and having no other idea of a &s;uperior, than that of a leader elected for a particular purpo&s;e, con&s;idered the royal dignity of Vortigern as equally devoid of importance and utility: It is not to be wondered at, there|fore, that Hengi&s;t, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his prince's ear, &s;hould, from the frequent inroads of the northern tribes, form a very convincing and per&s;ua&s;ive argument for the nece&s;&s;ity of a colony of his valiant countrymen to be placed in the north, to defend the country again&s;t them on their fir&s;t attacks.</P>
<P>The plau&s;ibility of this argument, the imbecillity of Vortigern's political judg|ment, the abjectne&s;s of &s;pirit which prevailed in the Briti&s;h council, and the wretchedne&s;s of the people, groaning under the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tyranny, together with the implicit confidence with which the prince li&s;tened to the admonitions of his &s;pecious friend, which flattered him with a &s;afe and indolent reign; all con|curred to facilitate the plan. Octa the brother of Hengi&s;t, and Ebu&s;&s;a his &s;on on receiving the &s;ummons, prepared with alacrity to collect their adherents, and in a &s;hort time pa&s;&s;ed over with a cho&s;en band and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Northumber|land in the year 454.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vortigern was by this time become a contemptible partizan of the Saxons, and &s;o immer&s;ed in vice and debauchery, that St German, deputy of the Gallican church in Britain, reprimanded him &s;everely for his adultery and di&s;&s;olute cour&s;e of life, which as he took no pains to reform, he was &s;olemnly anathematized in a council of the Briti&s;h clergy, and his &s;ubjects ab&s;olved from their oath of allegiance.&mdash;<HI>Nennius.

<P>The new colony had not been &s;ettled in this di&s;trict for any con&s;iderable time, before Hengi&s;t, no longer able as he pretended, to bear the indignities put upon him and his followers, and the infringements repeatedly made on the lands granted to them on their arrival, brought his troops into the field, and began ho&s;tilities. On his thus throwing off the ma&s;k, and appearing in arms at the head of his hardy Saxons, Vortigern's councils were full of confu&s;ion and a&s;to|ni&s;hment, and his &s;ubjects were &s;eized with a panic bordering on de&s;pair. The re&s;i&s;tance, therefore, they made, was weak and fruitle&s;s, and they fled before

<P>In the mean time the colony in Northumberland, looking upon Hengi&s;t's proceedings in Kent, as a &s;ignal for them, (as in all probability it was meant) to take up arms in the north, took the field.</P>
<P>The &s;truggles, during the cour&s;e of fifty years and upwards, were many, and various the events; the Britons remaining un&s;ubdued, and the Saxons unex|pelled. At length in the year 547, Ida with his twelve &s;ons, and a large rein|forcement, landed at Flambrough, where they were received by their countrymen with acclamations of joy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Illud tamen non immerito notandum, quod cum Wodeno fuerint tres filii, Weldegius, Wintle|gius, Beldegius; de primo, reges Cantauritarum; de &s;ecundo, Merciorum; de tertio, We&s;l&s;axonum $t Northumbrorum; praeter duos quos precedens fermo nominare perget, originem traxerint.

<P>From the authority of the <HI>Scala Chronica,</HI> it appears, that after Hengi&s;t had &s;ettled in Kent, Octa and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors a&s;&s;umed the title of dukes, until the Northumbrian Saxons following the example of tho&s;e in Kent, elected a &s;overeign, who yet remained &s;ubject to the &s;upreme authority of the Kenti&s;h king. They are named in the following order. <Q><HI>Hiring</HI> that begat <HI>Wodnam,</HI> that begat &startq;<HI>Witegla&s;s,</HI> of whom came <HI>Hort</HI> the King, that begat <HI>Uppa,</HI> that begat <HI>Heppa,</HI> that begat <HI>Hermeger,</HI> that begat <HI>Bernack;</HI> all which were before the noble &endq;King Ida; and the ge&s;tes of them before Ida be little known by croniques.</Q> But this account being ill &s;upported, it is more than probable, that Ida was the fir&s;t who a&s;&s;umed the name of King, over the Northumbrian colony. The &s;ucce&s;s and &s;afety of it being chiefly derived from him, this no doubt in|fluenced them to dignify him with this title, and from the power of the henezogen, to advance him to that of King. What induced the Saxons to for&s;ake their old con&s;titutional mode, and give Ida this new authority, authors are &s;ilent. It is probable they brought them&s;elves to adopt a Briti&s;h cu&s;tom, with a view of conciliating the natives to their government.</P>
<P>At this period when the Saxons were in a good mea&s;ure become ma&s;ters, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account of the &s;tate of religion among&s;t the Britons.</P>
<P>Pelagiani&s;m &s;till gaining ground, St German was, by earne&s;t entreaties, prevailed on to return, and was accompanied by Severus, Bi&s;hop of Triers. According to the credulity of the times, miracles were performed, which together with the force of rea&s;oning, put the &s;ectaries out of countenance; and &s;chools were in&s;tituted, in which young men of rank were taught the the &s;acred truths, uncontaminated with here&s;y. Dubricius who had the care of one of tho&s;e Seminaries, was made Bi&s;hop of Llandaff, and afterwards of Caerleon. The foundation of twelve mona&s;teries is attributed to him, who&s;e members earned their bread by labour. He was held in &s;uch e&s;teem,
<PB N="xxv" REF="31">that it is &s;aid he had the honor to inve&s;t Uther, and afterwards Arthur, with the en&s;igns of royalty: And in his time &s;o many excellent &s;eminaries flouri&s;hed, and di&s;ciples of &s;uch great eminence in the Church had reccived their educa|tion in them, that the fame of their civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical learning prevailed over Europe. At this time Britain was divided into three Archbi&s;hopric's, York, London, and Caerleon: The kingdom of Northumberland was in the juri&s;dic|tion of York, and the Briti&s;h Church received the fir&s;t form of its liturgy from German and Lupus, who introduced the order of the Gallican Church.</P>
<P>An in&s;tance of the authority of a clerical council, &s;o early as the reign of Vortigern, appears from his being cen&s;ured, and an anathema pronounced again&s;t him, under which his &s;ubjects were ab&s;olved from their oath of allegi|ance; a <HI>&s;econd</HI> in the con&s;ecration of St Dubricius; a <HI>third,</HI> for the recognition of the right of Arthur; a <HI>fourth,</HI> in the church of St David at Brevy, on the prevalence of Pelagiani&s;m; a <HI>fifth</HI> at Landaff, on the treaty of amity and peace be|tween Mauritius and Cynetu, two &s;overeigns of petty principalities in Wales; <HI>another</HI> at Landaff on the fatal di&s;&s;entions between Morcaunt and Frioc, two other petty Wel&s;h princes.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian religion, or rather the Church, is repre&s;ented by Gildas, at this time as &s;uffering a &s;everer per&s;ecution by the Saxon Idolaters than it had &s;uffer|ed even under Diocle&s;ian. But whether the barbarities complained of by this hi&s;torian were merely on account of religion, or whether other cau&s;es, as is ge|nerally the ca&s;e, did not al&s;o contribute thereto, is hard to &s;ay.</P>
<P>From St Gregory's epi&s;tle to the Franks it appears, that the pious example of the civilized Britons greatly influenced the Saxon conver&s;ion; but, from the unhappy di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of the chief Religious, the Briti&s;h Church refu&s;ing to give the nece&s;&s;ary encouragement to this propitious temper of the Saxons, with-held in&s;truction, and &s;hut the doors again&s;t their communion. It is to be wi&s;hed, that a veil could be drawn over the intolerating principles of &s;uch &s;u|percilious and &s;elf-righteous clergy, as thinking the Church in danger from Pe|lagiani&s;m, and yet were totally indifferent about bringing over the ignorant and idolatrous Saxons to a knowlege of the truths of Chri&s;tianity, even when they &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to embrace them.</P>
<P>Gregory &s;eeing their reprehen&s;ible conduct, with a degree of contempt, though not without pity, would not &s;uffer the propitious hour to elap&s;e, in which he judged the conver&s;ion of the Saxons depended, and therefore, in 182, &s;ent over Augu&s;tine, a man of rigid virtue, and powerful oratory, to attempt the im|portant work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sea. Chron. lib. 2. Lol. Col. v. ii. p. 514.</NOTE></P>
<P>After this account of the &s;tate of Britain in general, which it is pre&s;umed will not be thought an unnece&s;&s;ary introduction to that of the kingdom of Northumberland in particular, as leading the reader to that part of it which is to be the &s;ubject of this narrative; it is fir&s;t to be ob&s;erved, that this kingdom extended from the Humber northward to Lothian, and comprehended the great|e&s;t
<PB N="xxvi" REF="32">part of York&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire, Cumberland, We&s;tmorland, Durham, and what is now called the county of Northumberland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland's Itin. v. vi. p. 60.&mdash;Symeon Dunelm&mdash;Malm&s;bury, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But the kingdom of Ida, which was called Bernicia, as far as can be collected from the ob&s;curity which involves this di&s;tant part of hi&s;tory, comprehended only a narrow portion of the territory which afterwards formed the kingdom of Northumberland.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ert, that IDA having a&s;&s;umed the Sceptre, but what his title was, or whether got by election or u&s;urpation, authors give no account, he fixed his re&s;idence at<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hen.

By ma|ny writers he is &s;aid to be the original founder; but it is probable he found &s;ome antient works in this eligible &s;ituation, which induced him to fix his particu|lar attention to it; and that he repaired and enlarged the outworks, removed a wooden pali&s;adoe, with which the whole had been defended, and by a com|pleat circumvallation of ma&s;on-work, rendered the fortre&s;s as &s;trong as po&s;&s;ible<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden.</NOTE>. So far all authorities agree, that this was his chief place of re&s;idence. He held his Crown independent of that of Kent, or any other power. His reign was full of trouble and warfare; for, be&s;ides the fatigue incident to an infant State and un&s;ettled form of government, the Britons were frequently i&s;&s;uing from their places of concealment, and hara&s;&s;ing the frontiers of his kingdom; yet, with &s;uch military ardour did the Saxons defend, and with &s;uch judgment did Ida command, that, during a reign of twelve years, the enemy gained no con|&s;iderable advantage. He had i&s;&s;ue by his Queen &s;ix &s;ons, Adda, Ethelric, The|odoric, Edric, O&s;mer, and Theofredum; and, by his Concubines, &s;ix; Alric, Ogga, Ecca, O&s;bald, Segora, and Segothae, all of whom had come into Bri|tain along with him<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm.</NOTE>. On his demi&s;e he was &s;ucceeded by ADDA in 559, who reigned &s;even years; during which period, Aella, one of the Chief|tains who had come over with Ida, and was &s;aid to have been his nephew, con|ducted a body of forces again&s;t the province of<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 99</NOTE> Deira, and, having expelled the inhabitants, a&s;&s;umed &s;overeignty, and &s;ettled there with his retainers. Whether he marched the&s;e forces at the command or reque&s;t of his Sovereign, or he per&s;uaded them to &s;hare in his ambitious views, does not appear: Certain however it is, that he a&s;&s;umed a &s;eparate &s;overeignty. How far<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">That this was part of the kingdom of the <HI>Northumbrians,</HI> is a&s;&s;erted by the generality of our hi&s;torians, who agree with Bede in the divi&s;ion of it into the two &s;everal kingdoms of <HI>Deiri</HI> and <HI>Bernicii:</HI> Dera rice and Beornica rice, or, as the Saxon Chronicle has it, Dearne rice, p. 29. 23. and 32. 7.; and Baernice, p. 30, 2.; and Beornice, 44.26. But they are not &s;o well agreed as to the limits of the two le&s;&s;er kingdoms. Richard Prior of Hexham, fixes the limits of <HI>Deira</HI> between the rivers <HI>Humber</HI> and <HI>Tees:</HI> but tho&s;e of <HI>Bernicia,</HI> between the <HI>Tees</HI> and <HI>Twede.</HI> He affirms, that &s;ome of the Northumbrian Kings reigned only over the <HI>Deiri,</HI> as <HI>Aella;</HI> others over the <HI>Bernicii</HI> only, as <HI>Adda,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Aella:</HI> Some over both; as <HI>Edwine,</HI> &s;on of &s;ame <HI>Aella,</HI> and <HI>St O&s;wald</HI> and <HI>O&s;wius,</HI> from who&s;e times the king|dom remained entirely under one.

The&s;e woods, in all probability, extended from the <HI>Humber</HI> to the <HI>Derwent,</HI> which empties it &s;elf into the <HI>Tine,</HI> taking in Deor&wyn;ald; and Deorham in its way, which all of them bear &s;ome a&s;&s;inity with the name; the latter of which lies beyond the <HI>Tees,</HI> betwixt it and the <HI>Derwent:</HI> and there is a de&s;cription of it agreeable enough to our conjecture given in that elegant Saxon peom, which was fir&s;t printed in Symeon Dunelm.

And now if I have given the <HI>Deiri</HI> too large an ex|tent of dominion, the character of the learned and judicious editer of the Saxon Chronicle, who car|ries it farther, will &s;tand between me and cen&s;ure.

<P>Ethelfrith, di&s;appointed in his project, burned with re&s;entment again&s;t Red|wald, and immediately &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to demand the fugitive, as a traitor, and on refu&s;al, to denounce war again&s;t him. Redwald, con&s;idering the &s;trength of his enemy, would have delivered up the Prince; but the entreaties of his Queen, who repre&s;ented, in the mo&s;t forcible languge, the inviolable laws of ho&s;pitality, and the di&s;grace &s;uch an action would bring upon him, prevailed with him, not only to continue the protection he had granted, but al&s;o to levy an army, and in&s;tantly march again&s;t Northumberland, to cha&s;ti&s;e the haughty Monarch for his in&s;olent menaces.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued with &s;uch expedition, that Redwald was on the frontiers before the emba&s;&s;adors were returned. Alarmed at his &s;udden dan|ger, Ethelfrith rai&s;ed &s;uch forces as he could for the time, and advanced to &s;top the progre&s;s of the enemy. The armies joined battle on the banks of the Idle, near Nottingham, where Ethelfrith was &s;lain, and his forces routed. This vic|tory, though fortunate for Edwine, as it opened his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, was unhappy to Redwald, who lo&s;t his &s;on Regen here, in the engagement.</P>
<P>The &s;ons of Ethelfrith hearing of this great overthrow, and the death of their father, were conveyed by their mother Acca into Scotland, in order to &s;ecure them from the wrath of Edwine, leaving him no competitor for the Crown.</P>
<P>Ethelfrith reigned twenty-four years, leaving i&s;&s;ue by his Queen &s;even &s;ons, Eanfred, O&s;wald, O&s;wine, Ol&s;ac, O&s;wid, O&s;&s;a, and O&s;&s;a, al&s;o two daughters,

<P>It doth not appear that the Northumbrians had the light of the go&s;pel before the reign of Edwine. The Saxons had brought along with them their own gods, and few of the old Briti&s;h rites, except the Bel-tein, were retained. The modes of wor&s;hip introduced by the Romans were forgotten, and their temples and altars levelled in the du&s;t; and, till the Saxon mythology prevailed, it is much to be doubted whether there was any &s;ettled religion within the limits of this mi&s;erable di&s;trict. Whether the &s;tupendous monument on Yevering-Bell<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See View of Northumberland, v. i. p. 246.</NOTE> was appropriated to Saxon or Briti&s;h wor&s;hip, is not ea&s;ily determined. Its vicinity to Yevering, once a royal man&s;ion of the Saxon monarchs, prompts an idea, that it was a holy place of that people. EDWINE, &s;upported by the arms of Redwald, entered the capital of Northumberland in 617, and a&s;&s;umed the diadem, having then attained the age of twenty-three years. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a noble and intrepid &s;pirit, and conducted his military ope|rations with &s;uch &s;kill and fortitude, that in a &s;hort time he not only relieved the frontiers of his kingdom from the ravages and incur&s;ions of the neighbour|ing nations, but extended his dominions even as far as the Orcades and Meva|nian i&s;lands, now called the Hebrides<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede's Eccl. $$&s;t. lib. 11.

<P>His wife, Cwenburga, the daughter of Ceorl, King of Mercia, did not live to &s;ee him mount the Throne. About eight years after his acce&s;&s;ion, the emi|nent virtues and uncommon beauty of Ethelburga, daughter of the King of Kent, reaching his car, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to require her in marriage. She had embraced the Chri&s;tian faith, but he retaining his national prejudices and religious tenets, it was nece&s;&s;ary that conditions &s;hould be &s;tipulated for the free exerci&s;e to her religion, and that &s;he &s;hould have her mini&s;ters to officiate there|in. The&s;e preliminaries being &s;ettled, &s;he was &s;ent into Northumberland, under the &s;piritual tuition of Paulinus, ordained Bi&s;hop by Ju&s;tus on that occa&s;ion, and the marriage was celebrated in 625<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Wm.

<P>At this time Cwichelm, in conjunction with his father, Cynegils, governed the kingdom of We&s;&s;ex; a Prince of a dark and jealous mind, who ob&s;erving the growing power and exalted glory of Edwine with envy, and conceiving he might di&s;turb the le&s;&s;er kingdoms of the Heptarchy, of which We&s;&s;ex was then one of the weake&s;t, determined to take him off by &s;ecret a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. For this purpo&s;e he employed one Eumer, of whom Hi&s;torians have &s;aid no|thing previous to this plot. Edwine's Court was then held on the banks of Derwent, where the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in approached him in the character of amba&s;&s;ador, and delivering a feigned addre&s;s, the &s;pecious purport of which engaged the King's attention, the villain drew a poi&s;oned dagger from under his cloak, and at|tempted
<PB N="xxxi" REF="37">to plunge it in Edwine's bo&s;om.

<P>The wound was at fir&s;t alarming, which gave an opportunity to Paulinus to exhort him to renounce the errors of his religion; and the pious example, and tender love of Ethelburga, contributed not a little to di&s;po&s;e his mind to the arguments for his conver&s;ion; and at length, by a &s;olemn vow, he promi&s;ed, <Q>&startq;That if the Deity which the Chri&s;tians wor&s;hipped, and whom they called the God of ju&s;tice, would enable him to puni&s;h the violator of the laws of nature, nations, and kings, who unprovoked, had &s;ent forth the murder|er again&s;t him, he would from thenceforth confe&s;s his divinity, and wor&s;hip &endq;no other Gods but him.</Q> As a pledge of his vow, he delivered into the hands of Paulinus his infant daughter Ean&s;led to be bapti&s;ed, who was brought into the world the evening of the &s;ame day in which the horrid attempt had been made upon his life<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 1. She was the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian bapti&s;ed in Northumberland.&mdash;Lel. Col. v. i. p. 335.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as health permitted, he arrayed his troops, and marched again&s;t the We&s;t-Saxons, whom he overthrew in the fir&s;t battle, and put to the &s;word all tho&s;e who had devi&s;ed his death by Eumer the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. Hi&s;torians do not men|tion, whether he made any political advantages to his kingdom by this war, or &s;at down &s;atisfied with the i&s;&s;ue of his revenge.</P>
<P>In the following year, 627, during the fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter, he embraced the Chri&s;tian faith, and was bapti&s;ed by Paulinus, and many of his &s;ubjects followed his example. He was greatly moved to his conver&s;ion, Bede faith, by a vi&s;ion; which he relates to the following purport. Whil&s;t Edwine remained under Redwald's protection, being appri&s;ed that an attempt was made to induce Red|wald to deliver him up to his enemies, as he &s;at meditating in the night, at the door of his apartment, he was acco&s;ted by a &s;tranger, who told him he knew the cau&s;e of his grief, gave him much con&s;olation, and a&s;&s;ured him Redwald's intention was diverted by the virtuous remon&s;trances of his Queen. He al&s;o predicted to him the pro&s;perity of his future life, and gave him &s;ome wi&s;e and pious admonitions. Edwine promi&s;ed the &s;tranger, that, if the things he fore|told came to pa&s;s, he would certainly follow his doctrines, and obey his pre|cepts; on which the grave monitor de&s;ired him to bear in memory, the time, place, and conver&s;ation; and, laying his hand on his head, ble&s;&s;ed him, and in&s;tantly di&s;appeared. Edwine, for &s;ome time after his victorious expedition again&s;t the We&s;t Saxons, delayed to perform his vow; but being accu&s;tomed to employ &s;ome hours in &s;olitude and meditation, was retired to his chamber, when Paulinus, e&s;teeming it a propitious hour for his holy purpo&s;e, entered the
<PB N="xxxii" REF="38">royal apartment, and without apology, boldly approached the King, and laid his right hand upon his head, and ble&s;&s;ed him, a&s;king whether he remembered that &s;ign and token? Edwine, as if rou&s;ed by the hand of &s;ome &s;upernatural Power, and trembling at once with religious horror and conviction of mind, prepared to kneel at the pious Bi&s;hop's feet; but he re&s;training him, thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his Sovereign: <Q>Behold Sir, by the benevolence of our &startq;merciful and omnipotent God, you have e&s;caped the wrath of your enemies; by his mighty hand, and irre&s;i&s;tible will, you have a&s;cended the Throne of this kingdom; remember therefore your &s;olemn vow; forthwith let the &s;ame be accompli&s;hed; embrace his &s;aving health; let your &s;pirit live in his faith and holy laws, who hath brought about the&s;e mighty things upon the earth, and hath exalted you to maje&s;ty and honour: By his divine power, you &s;hall not only be pre&s;erved from everla&s;ting death, under the precepts I teach, but &s;hall be made a partaker of his ineffable beatitude, and everla&s;ting glory in &endq;the regions of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding chapter, he goes on to relate Edwine's calling together the States, his &s;ages and coun&s;ellors, to deliberate on the changes of religion, and to examine into the principles of the new doctrine. On this occa&s;ion Coyfi, the High-Prie&s;t of the Heathen Temple, boldly impeached the impotence of the Divinities they &s;erved, and one of the chief nobles profe&s;&s;ed, that in the prin|ciples of their religion, there was no hope of futurity. After piou&s;ly attending to the arguments of Paulinus, &s;upported by the proofs of a divine revelation, he publicly renounced the errors of the Saxon religion, and, in his zeal for Chri&s;tianity, propo&s;ed to have their temples and altars de&s;troyed. Edwine, di&s;|turbed with a &s;uper&s;tition, founded on the prejudices of early education, &s;tood confounded at the propo&s;ition, and demanded which among them had the im|pious courage to dare the wrath of divinities they &s;o long had wor&s;hipped, to try their &s;trength, or prove their impotence? The Prie&s;t being armed, and mounted on a hor&s;e, advanced towards the temple. The multitude, &s;truck with horror at his temerity, waited the event with trembling. He entered their holy place, and throwing his &s;pear again&s;t the altars, defied the whole a&s;&s;embly. The univer&s;al &s;ilence was awful; but the impotent gods avenged not. The Prie&s;t then putting up a thank&s;giving aloud, to that Omnipotent whom he had &s;o lately learned to addre&s;s, commanded his attendants to break down the idols and their altars, and &s;et fire to the temple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be ob&s;erved, that proper covered temples appear not to have been erected for the &s;ervice of tho&s;e Pagan Idols which the Saxons here wor&s;hipped: Polluit et de&s;truxit eas, quas ip&s;e &s;acraverat, aedes, &s;ays the Latin Bede.</NOTE>. This public &s;pectacle opened the eyes of the vulgar; and as there was no prie&s;t-craft to amu&s;e, or art to delude, the whole was laid in a&s;hes, without any great &s;hock to them; for if prejudices in favour of Saxon idolatry were not hereby quite rooted out, they would at lea&s;t be con&s;iderably abated.</P>
<P>Bede &s;ays, the &s;cite of this temple, in his days, was to be &s;een not far from Eboracum, at the head of the Derwent, then called Gotmundingaham. But
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="39">the old Hi&s;torian has been mi&s;informed, for it is well known to have been at Godmanham, near Market-Weighton, (the antient Delgovitia)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The place where the Pagan temple &s;tood, at Godmundingham, &s;eems to be an exact &s;emicircle, (who&s;e diameter is 260 yards, being di&s;tingui&s;hed into a great many parts or portions, whereof &s;ome &s;eem to be more peculiarly de&s;igned for the wor&s;hip of the idols, the re&s;t to be offices or appendices for the reception of &s;uch per&s;ons as came there to wor&s;hip; and others again appear probably to have been the place where the victims them&s;elves were &s;lain and offered, and where all their nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;ils were depo&s;ited. Sub|&s;ervient to this latter purpo&s;e, is a place in length 350 yards, in breadth twelve or fourteen, and about eight yards deep, except on the ea&s;t, where, from this bottom, there ri&s;es a hill at lea&s;t eight or nine fathoms perpendicular, whence one ea&s;ily &s;urveys the whole area, and which &s;eems to have been more particularly &s;et apart for the wor&s;hip of the chief idol: for this hill (as it was &s;aid) was artificial, and probably made of the rubbi&s;h which was dug out from below.

The re&s;tle&s;s people were ea&s;ily provoked to an in&s;urrection, and with a mad enthu&s;ia&s;m to cry out for liberty, though withdrawing their allegiance from Edwine could only tend to expo&s;e them to a &s;ubjugation more wretched, and a va&s;&s;alage more &s;evere. Cedwell calling upon all tho&s;e whom the name of freedom could animate or delude, took the field, and began with cruelty and deva&s;tation to mark his progre&s;s in the frontier di&s;|tricts. Edwine prepared to oppo&s;e him, whil&s;t Penda, in con&s;equence of his compact, joined his forces with the Britons, and at a place called Hethfield, waited the approach of the Northumbrians to give them battle. The conflict was dreadful. Edwine, and his elde&s;t &s;on Osfrid, with many men of note,

<P>The conquerors entered Northumberland with fire and &s;word, where they committed the mo&s;t in human ravages.

<P>EANFRID a&s;&s;umed the reigns of government in the year 633, in the province of Bernicia, and OSRIC in the province of Deira: And thus the kingdom of Northumberland became divided, as before, by each rightful heir &s;eizing his own province<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

Un|moved with the humiliation of a King, uninfluenced by ju&s;tice, or clemency, and again&s;t the common faith of nations, even among &s;avages, Cedwell &s;atiated him&s;elf in the blood of him who kneeled for his protection<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede &s;ays, the Britons had no opinion of the Chri&s;tianity of the Saxons, and refu&s;ed to commune with them in the offices of religion any more than with profe&s;&s;ed Heathens; &s;o that though Cedwell was a Chri&s;|tian, he had no mercy to the Saxons, and &s;pared neither age nor &s;ex.</NOTE>.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES OF THE COUNTY PALATINE OF DURHAM.</HEAD>
<P>OSWALD having openly profe&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tian religion, was anxious to bring his &s;ubjects to follow his example. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent me&s;&s;en|gers to Donald the Fourth, King of Scotland, under who&s;e au&s;pices he had lived during his retirement, reque&s;ting &s;ome holy mi&s;&s;ionaries might take the charge of their conver&s;ion. The fir&s;t per&s;on &s;ent on this pious office, Bede &s;ays, was of an au&s;tere di&s;po&s;ition, and his name, as given by Hector Boethius, was Corman.</P>
<P>After preaching a &s;hort time, and meeting with little reverence, he returned home di&s;gu&s;ted. When called upon by the Synod to give an account of his mi&s;|&s;ion, he attributed his ill-&s;ucce&s;s to the &s;luggi&s;h capacities of the Engli&s;h, their fierce and impatient nature, together with ob&s;tinate prejudices, which could not be reclaimed. This report not being &s;atisfactory, Aidan, a pious pre&s;byter, brought up in the mona&s;tery of Hii<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wharton's Ang. Sacra&mdash;Selden's Preface to the Decem Scriptores.</NOTE>, is &s;aid to have &s;poken freely again&s;t Corman, concei|ving he had treated the people with too great &s;everity, contrary to the Apo&s;tle's in&s;truction, not having fir&s;t di&s;pen&s;ed the milk of a mild and placid doctrine, un|til they had gained a due &s;en&s;e of the &s;alutary joys of the word of God, enabling them to advance more my&s;terious and &s;ublime principles, the duties of greater &s;elf|denial, and a full knowledge of the divine ordinances. He propo&s;ed that a per|&s;on of milder di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould be &s;ent, who, with lenient &s;peech and gentle man|ners, might in&s;inuate him&s;elf into their affections. The whole a&s;&s;embly approved
<PB N="2" REF="44">what Aidan advanced, and unanimou&s;ly determined that he was worthy of the appointment, and &s;hould accordingly be di&s;patched to this unconverted nation; for, as Bede &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. 3. c. 5.&mdash;Hollin&s;hed&mdash;Spot&s;wood.</NOTE>, he was proved to po&s;&s;e&s;s that jewel, di&s;cretion, the handmaid of all virtues. It may be thought &s;trange, perhaps, that O&s;wald &s;hould &s;end into Scotland for a mi&s;&s;ionary to in&s;truct his &s;ubjects in the Chri&s;tian religion, and that he did not rather recall Paulinus, who had been driven from the See of York. But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that O&s;wald had been in&s;tructed in religion by the Scotch, and had imbibed an aver&s;ion for the mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent from Rome, on ac|count of the diver&s;ity of &s;entiments between the Scotch and Romani&s;ts, in rela|tion to the celebration of Ea&s;ter, and the ton&s;ure of prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>O&s;wald received this &s;econd mi&s;&s;ionary with great veneration. Authors di&s;agree about the &s;eminary from whence he came, &s;ome alledging Melros, others Hii, and Ridpath, I'colm-kill: But it &s;eems well &s;ettled, that he was a brother of the hou&s;e of Hii or Jona, one of the i&s;lands called Hebrides; and it is generally allowed that he came to O&s;wald's court in the year 634<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>Aidan, having reaped &s;uch happy fruits of his labours, had the whole dominions of O&s;wald before him, wherein to chu&s;e a place of re&s;idence.

<P>Aidan's character was excellent, all authors agreeing that he lived what he preached; and Bede, in particular, writes of him as follows: <Q>Aidan was con|&s;ecrated &startq;Bi&s;hop when Segenius was Abbot of the mona&s;tery of Hii; in which, among other rules for the conduct of life, he left the religious an excellent ex|ample of continence and &s;elf-denial. His doctrines were recommended to the world by his conduct, which &s;trictly corre&s;ponded with his precepts. He de&s;ired not the things of the earth, nor was he enamoured of the vanities of life: He had &s;incere plea&s;ure in di&s;tributing in alms what the wealthy gave; for he laid not up trea&s;ures el&s;ewhere than in Heaven. He went about teaching the go&s;pel daily, as well in the adjacent country as in the city; and never but on urgent occa&s;ions rode on hor&s;eback, preferring the more humble progre&s;s on foot. Whom&s;oever he met, rich or poor, he taught the go&s;pel, by every argument his rhetoric and zeal &s;ugge&s;ted, working the conver&s;ion of &s;ome, and &s;trengthening the faith of others, exhorting all, as well by precept as example, to works of charity, piety, and virtue. His religious life &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the negligence and lukewarm devotion of our times, that all tho&s;e who accompanied him were the profe&s;&s;ed or lay brethren, who gave up their whole time to contemplation: Reading and expounding the &s;cripture, or rehear&s;ing the p&s;alter, was the daily exerci&s;e of him and his brethren, to what place &s;oever they came. Whenever he was invited to the King's banquet, he took with him two or three clerks, and making a &s;hort repa&s;t, quickly retired, either to read with his brethren, or go to prayer. From his example of ab&s;tinence, the religious of both &s;exes accu&s;|tomed them&s;elves to fa&s;t on Wedne&s;days and Fridays until the hour of three in the afternoon. Whenever the nobles tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the rules of the go&s;pel, neither the fear of di&s;plea&s;ure, or hope of reward, checked the &s;everity of his reproof. He made no pre&s;ents to tho&s;e who vi&s;ited him, however exalted their rank, but offered them merely nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment. He applied the rich gifts which he received to pious u&s;es, relieving the poor, or ran&s;oming tho&s;e who had been wrongfully &s;old, and were in wretched captivity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here have evidence of &s;laves being held by the inhabitants of this land, as early at lea&s;t as the days of Bede, and from the&s;e were the villains of after ages.</NOTE>, &s;everal of whom, after redemption, he took for pupils, bringing them up in the &s;chool of virtue and &endq;pious erudition, and thence exalting them to the high dignity of prie&s;thood<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spotti&s;wood&mdash;Hollin&s;hed&mdash;Collier, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

O&s;wy, of a turbulent and ambitious temper, eager for extent of dominion, and impatient of a rival in the empire, &s;ought frequent occa&s;ions to di&s;turb O&s;wine, and at length an open rupture took place.</P>
<P>It appears from &s;everal ancient writers, that Aidan was much intere&s;ted in O&s;|wine's affairs; in one part he is called the king's familiar. The divi&s;ion of the kingdom being the cau&s;e of di&s;&s;ention between the &s;overeigns, he laboured much to reconcile them; and from the grief &s;u&s;tained on O&s;wine's death, he &s;urvived him but twelve days. Though authors are &s;ilent as to the fact, yet the circum|&s;tances imply, that Aidan had been bu&s;y in &s;ecular affairs, and influenced O&s;|wine's acce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Deira. O&s;wy was brother to Aidan's great pa|tron, the founder of the church of Lindisfarne, as king of Bernicia, where the epi&s;copal &s;ee was e&s;tabli&s;hed. Notwith&s;tanding this, the pious bi&s;hop was an ad|herent to O&s;wine; but whence the attachment aro&s;e, more than from O&s;wine's piety, is not &s;aid, O&s;wy not being accu&s;ed of irreligion. Broken-hearted, how|ever, as it &s;eems, for having led O&s;wine into &s;chemes of fatal ambition, he died of grief on the la&s;t day of Augu&s;t, in the 17th year of his epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P>Both kings took the field: O&s;wy's pa&s;&s;ion for arms had induced him to train and di&s;cipline his troops, even in times of profound peace; whil&s;t O&s;wine &s;tudied to cultivate the arts which enrich a people, and neglected tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to make him re&s;pectable in the field. O&s;wy's army was more numerous and better ar|rayed than that of O&s;wine; to whom this being made known, willing to &s;pare the effu&s;ion of blood, he declined coming to an engagement; and when his friends urged him to try the event of battle, he &s;ecretly withdrew, and concealed him&s;elf in the hou&s;e of Humwald, in hopes he might abide in &s;afety, and elude the &s;earch of his enemy. Humwald had been rai&s;ed in his dignities by the bounty of O&s;wine; Gillingham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gillingham, or Guethlin, where this tragical event happened, is pre&s;umed to be the hamlet or town of Gilling in York&s;hire, within two miles of Richmond.

His fame was &s;o great in other courts, that the nobility of various realms were in his &s;uite, am|bitiou&s;ly &s;triving to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by him. Amid&s;t his virtues, his humility, &endq;and religious lowline&s;s, were excellent.</Q></P>
<P>As to the di&s;putes about the celebration of Ea&s;ter, in the time of this prelate, and of his patron, O&s;wald, it is ob&s;erved by Collier, <Q>That Bede, though an ad|herent &startq;to the Roman ritual, did not think the pope a nece&s;&s;ary center of com|munion, or that the re&s;t of Chri&s;tendom were indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to be &s;ub|ject to his authority. Had this been his opinion, he would never have rai&s;ed &endq;O&s;wald and Aidan to &s;o great a di&s;tinction of &s;aint&s;hip.</Q> But Collier's par|tiality is obvious; for he could not have overlooked what Bede really &s;ays; <Q>&startq;Thus much I have written of this holy man and his works, not approving his wrong ob&s;ervation of Ea&s;ter, according to the Jewi&s;h computation, but dete&s;t|ing that in him utterly, as I have expre&s;sly declared in my book, De Temporibus. But, as it behoveth a true hi&s;toriographer, I have related &s;uch things of him, and his works, as may profit the reader. That he was a man of great cha|rity, and of a placid &s;pirit; of &s;trict continency and humility; &s;uperior to wrath and covetou&s;ne&s;s, and a dete&s;ter of pride and vain glory. I al&s;o prai&s;e his great indu&s;try, both in ob&s;erving and teaching the laws of God; his dili|gence in &s;tudy, his faithful watchings, his holy dignity in rebuking the haughty and proud, and mild demeanor in comforting the lowly and weak of heart; together with his unbounded liberality in relieving the poor. In &s;hort, I com|mend him, as one that laboured all his days (for &s;uch he was reported to me by one who knew him intimately), to accompli&s;h all that is written in the holy &s;criptures, the precepts of Prophets and Apo&s;tles. The&s;e things, in that holy prelate, I do love and prai&s;e, as undoubtedly being acceptable to Almighty God. But that he ob&s;erved not Ea&s;ter in its due &s;ea&s;on, either through ignorance, or under the prejudices of his country, if he knew better, this I neither commend or allow. Yet in this very point I admit, that, in his manner of ob&s;erving Ea&s;ter, he believed, reverenced, and taught no other doctrine than we do, the redemption of mankind by the pa&s;&s;ion, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t &endq;Je&s;us, the mediator between God and Man.</Q></P>
<P>It would be treating the reader with no re&s;pectful deference to repeat Bede's ac|count of two miracles attributed to Aidan; the fir&s;t, on Penda's attempt to &s;et fire to Bebbanburgh, of the wind changing on the prayer of Aidan; the latter, on calming a &s;torm, by pouring &s;ome &s;anctified oil into the &s;ea, by his advice, on fore&s;eeing a &s;torm might happen. Of the former a &s;hrewd gue&s;s might be made by a re&s;ident on Lindisfarne, on ob&s;erving the almo&s;t regular breeze, with the in|flux of the tide, the time when Aidan is &s;aid to have offered up his prayer. Of the latter, it is not unfair to infer, that the good man had read Pliny.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid Cuthbert, a &s;hepherd near Melros, had a holy vi&s;ion, and beheld the &s;pirit of Aidan a&s;cending to Heaven; which made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, that he determined to lead a religious life, and &s;oon after gained admittance into that mona&s;tery.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="50">
<P>During Aidan's time, Lindisfarne was the &s;upreme &s;ee in the north, York be|ing vacant.</P>
<P>When O&s;wy had removed the ob&s;tacle to an union of the provinces, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Deira; but his government was not e&s;tabli&s;hed more than two years, when Ethelwald, the &s;on of O&s;wald, appeared, having attained the age of &s;ixteen years, and heading the malcontents in Deira, declared him&s;elf a competitor for that crown. The province was glad to embrace an opportunity of &s;haking off the yoke of O&s;wy, whom they looked upon with dete&s;tation, on account of the inno|cent blood of O&s;wine, who&s;e memory they revered. O&s;wy, with repeated efforts, was not able to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him, every &s;truggle terminating in Ethelwald's favour.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e revolutions happened in the &s;tate, on Aidan's death a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the &s;ee of Lindisfarne was brought from the &s;ame Scotti&s;h mona&s;tery; and it is ob&s;ervable, that all the mona&s;teries in Scotland were &s;ubject to Jona, as being the fir&s;t foundation; which unravels the confu&s;ion of ancient authors as to the &s;chool in which the fir&s;t bi&s;hops of Lindisfarne were educated.</P>

<P>It appears that he was warm in the di&s;pute which for &s;ome time agitated the Church, touching the ob&s;ervation of Ea&s;ter, and remained inflexible to the argu|ments of Ronan, a Scot&s;man, who had received his education in Italy, and was &s;ent to divert his opinion.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iii. c. 25.</NOTE> Bede &s;ays, he was a ha&s;ty tempered man, and, by &s;uch di&s;putation, was exa&s;perated, and made a profe&s;&s;ed adver&s;ary to the Roman u&s;age.</P>
<P>That controver&s;y, he adds, brought many to the true faith, but inflamed others to a farther &s;earch and examination of the que&s;tion. They increa&s;ed after Colman &s;ucceeded to this bi&s;hopric, and other di&s;putes ari&s;ing touching external practices and ceremonies, many began to fear and doubt, lea&s;t, bearing the name of Chri&s;|tians, they, in the Apo&s;tles words, <HI>had run in vain.</HI> The tribulation even reached the palaces of princes.</P>
<P>O&s;wy had &s;carce reconciled him&s;elf to the lo&s;s of Deira, before Penda, renewing ho&s;tilities in Bernicia, reduced him in a &s;hort time to extremities. Offers of peace were rejected, and the noble gifts, even the regal in&s;ignia, jewels, and ornaments of the throne, were refu&s;ed with &s;corn: Nothing but extent of empire could &s;a|tisfy the Mercian. Add to this, that Ethelwald then brought his forces into the field, and declared him&s;elf Penda's ally.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e complicated calamities, O&s;wy determined to try the event of battle, as it was evident nothing but ruin would be the con&s;equence of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He
<PB N="9" REF="51">collected a few veterans in whom he could place confidence, and, together with his &s;on Alcfrid, led them forth, tru&s;ting for &s;ucce&s;s in the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e. Ethelwald, before the on&s;et, con&s;idering, that the &s;ucce&s;s of either party would finally terminate in his ruin, when the Mercians charged, withdrew his forces to ob&s;erve the event, that he might be the better enabled to deal with the victor. This at once gave courage to the Bernicians, and at the &s;ame time &s;truck the Mer|cians with a panic; for, fearing they were betrayed, they betook them&s;elves to flight. December was far advanced when this engagement happened, and the place where it was fought was near to Loidis, which Camden conjectures is now Leeds, on the banks of the river then called Winwed. Penda, and his ally Ethelric, king of the Ea&s;t-Angles, tried every effort to rally the di&s;concerted army, which greatly exceeded that of the Bernicians, and, as &s;ome authors alledge, were thirty to one; but, in the confu&s;ion, both leaders falling, their va&s;t army was put to the rout; and what greatly encrea&s;ed the &s;laughter, was the &s;udden inundation of the river, which, overflowing the plain where Penda had drawn up his forces, add|ed to the embarra&s;&s;ment of the flying troops; &s;o that a great number peri&s;hed in the water.</P>
<P>Bede's account is, that, before the battle, O&s;wy made a &s;olemn vow to God, that, if he prevailed, he would dedicate his daughter to the &s;ervice of Heaven, in perpetual virginity, and grant twelve farm-holds, with the appurtenant lands, for the erection and endowment of religious hou&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Charlton, in his hi&s;tory of Whitby, remarks a mi&s;take that mo&s;t of our hi&s;torians have fallen into, who a&s;&s;ert, that Ethelwald returned at the head of his troops into his own dominions, where he reigned peaceably &s;everal years after; which is an account that abounds with contradictions: For, in the fir&s;t place, it does not appear that Ethelwald had ever been out of his own dominions, &s;ince Leeds, where the &s;cene of the late action had been, lay almo&s;t in the centre of Deira, or at lea&s;t very far di&s;tant from any of its borders. And, next, all authors affirm that O&s;wy, &s;oon after this engagement, wherein he had &s;lain Penda, made a conque&s;t of Mercia, to which he could have no acce&s;s but through the dominions of Ethel|wald. Now it appears not at all likely that he would advance &s;o far to the &s;outhward, without fir&s;t making &s;ure of what was behind him, and &s;ubduing tho&s;e provinces which, through all the former part of his reign, he had been &s;o anxious of having under his &s;ubjection. And, la&s;tly, it is well known that Strean|&s;halh Abbey was the mona&s;tery, or nunnery, he founded in con&s;equence of his vow, which certainly would never have been the ca&s;e if he had not con&s;idered that place as &s;ituate in his own dominions. Therefore we may rea&s;onably conclude, that the &s;overeignty of Deira henceforward remained in O&s;wy, and that Ethelwald, though he was permitted to live, on account of his con&s;anguinity to O&s;wy, never more exer|ci&s;ed the regal power, but lived as a private man on his own patrimonial e&s;tate, or on &s;ome lands belong|ing to the crown, which his uncle might &s;uffer him to enjoy.</NOTE>. No &s;ooner was he re&s;ted from fatigue, than he performed the vow, by giving his child Elfleda, &s;carce one year old, to be brought up in the holy Church. He granted al&s;o the promi&s;ed lands for religious foundations; &s;ix farm-holds in the province of Bernicia, and the &s;ame number in Deira. Early in the Saxon Church, religious women, after the example of mona&s;tic orders, a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves in holy &s;i&s;terhoods, and &s;ome a&s;&s;umed a &s;uperiority in tho&s;e hou&s;es. Bede &s;ays, <Q>That Here&s;wide, mother to &startq;Adulphe, king of the Ea&s;t-Angles, lived under religious rule and di&s;cipline with her &s;i&s;ter in a mona&s;tery in France; where, having re&s;ided for one year, &s;he was invited into Britain by Aidan, and the lands of a lord&s;hip, on the north &s;hore of the Were, were granted her, where &s;he lived, with &s;everal religious women, under mona&s;tic rules for a year, after which &s;he was elected abbe&s;s of
<PB N="10" REF="52">the mona&s;tery of Heortheu, now Hartlepoole, which had been built not long before by the devout woman Heiu, who is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t in the province of Northumberland that took the vow and habit of a nun, being profe&s;&s;ed and con|&s;ecrated &endq;by Aidan.</Q> On her leaving this mona&s;tery to &s;ettle at Colche&s;ter, &s;he was &s;ucceeded at Heortheu by <Q>Hilda, who conducted the &s;ame with regularity of &startq;life and di&s;cipline for &s;everal years, and at length built the mona&s;tery of Strane&s;|halch, now Whitby, where &s;he &s;pent the remainder of her life. O&s;wy's de|voted daughter entered the mona&s;tery of Heortheu, or, as it is called in another place, Harte&s;ilond, there to be brought up under Hilda, the abbe&s;s, in mona&s;tic &endq;di&s;cipline.</Q></P>
<P>Several authors alledge, that the battle before &s;poken of was fought in the pro|vince of Bernicia, at a place called Winwidfield, near the river Winwid. Others fix it at a &s;pot called Loidis, which, as was before ob&s;erved, Camden interprets Leeds; but this will not corre&s;pond with the province of Bernicia, the &s;outhern limit of which was the Tees. Bede &s;ays it was fought near the river Imet. From the name of the river, and al&s;o from the name of the place, it is probable the battle was fought at Whinfield, not far from Lodor, on the banks of the river Emot, or Emont.</P>
<P>O&s;wy, pur&s;uing his &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ubjugated the kingdom of Mercia. He entertain|ed Peada, the &s;on of Penda, with great friend&s;hip; and, di&s;covering in him &s;ingu|lar virtues, on his con&s;enting to become a Chri&s;tian, gave him his daughter Alc|fleda, whom he had by a concubine, in marriage, re&s;igning to him the govern|ment of the &s;outhern parts of Mercia, &s;eparated from the northern by the Trent.</P>
<P>O&s;wy had in him a &s;trange mixture of virtues and vices; in the beginning, bloody and tyrannous; towards his latter end, ju&s;t and moderate. He was highly addict|ed to &s;uper&s;tition, and the blood of O&s;wine continually hung upon his con&s;cience; to expiate which, he vowed to make a pilgrimage to Rome; but, falling &s;ick, death fru&s;trated his project. He reigned twenty-eight years, and died 15th Fe|bruary 670, in the 58th year of his age.</P>
<P>All the ancient hi&s;torians are &s;ilent as to the fate of Ethelwald. Rapin &s;ays, but quotes no authority, that, dying without heirs, two years after the battle of Winwid, Deira devolved on O&s;wy:&mdash;And &s;ome &s;till later writers &s;eem to have adopted his opinion, with no better &s;upport. It &s;eems mo&s;t probable, that he was depo&s;ed immediately after the victory.</P>
<P>O&s;wy had by Eanfled his queen, two &s;ons and one daughter: Egfrid, the elde&s;t, &s;ucceeded to the united crowns of Deira and Bernicia: El&s;win, the younge&s;t, fell in battle at the age of eighteen. Elfleda, the daughter, took the veil, as before mentioned, and became abbe&s;s of Whitby, where &s;he died. Ean&s;led, his widowed queen, retired to the &s;ame mona&s;tery, where &s;he &s;pent the remainder of her life, and was interred with the remains of O&s;wy and Elfleda. O&s;wy had, by his concu|bines, two children; Alcfrid, who &s;ucceeded Ethelwald in Deira, and, at la&s;t, his brother Eg&s;rid, on the whole throne of Northumberland; and Alc&s;leda, who was married to Peada, Penda's &s;on, and, by mo&s;t writers, charged with the death of her hu&s;band.</P>

The religious tendency of this mat|ter was undoubtedly of importance in tho&s;e times, and the maintenance of uni|formity would have a great effect in vulgar minds: Be&s;ides, there was likely to ari&s;e much confu&s;ion, even in the royal hou&s;ehold, by the different times of hold|ing the fe&s;tival; for the queen having been brought up where the Romi&s;h orders prevailed, held to tho&s;e rules; &s;o that it &s;ometimes happened, the king and his courtiers were enjoying the holy fe&s;tival at the &s;ame time that the queen and her
<PB N="12" REF="54">&s;uite were in the &s;olemnity of Lent. To put an end to all di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quences, and that uniformity might be maintained, the king appointed a time for the matter to be argued in the mona&s;tery of Whitby, before the abbe&s;s Hilda, who had a celebrated character for piety and godly works. This convention, or &s;ynod, was held in the year 664, the king and his &s;on being pre&s;ent. Colman was commanded to explain and &s;upport the Scotti&s;h rules, which he did chiefly by the example of St John the Evangeli&s;t. Wilfrid replied, and oppo&s;ed the bi&s;hop's ar|guments, even on his own principles, from the practice of St John. He appears, from the relation, to have had greater powers of eloquence, and more knowledge in di&s;putation. When Colman in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;anctity of tho&s;e who&s;e example the Scotti&s;h Church followed, Wilfrid judiciou&s;ly &s;eized the &s;pirit of his adver&s;ary's argument, and clo&s;ed his &s;peech with this memorable text of &s;cripture; <Q><HI>Thou &startq;art Peter, and on this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell &s;hall not &endq;prevail again&s;t it: And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of Heaven.</HI></Q> Struck with this powerful text, and with Wilfrid's a&s;&s;ertion, that the Romi&s;h u&s;age was &s;upported by Peter's own example; and all parties confe&s;&s;ing, that the words of &s;cripture were ju&s;tly &s;et forth, the king immediately determined for the Romi&s;h cu&s;tom. Colman was &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted, that, after having filled the &s;ee only three years, he left Lindisfarne, taking with him about thirty Engli&s;h prie&s;ts, and all his own countrymen, who per&s;evered in the u&s;ages of the Scotti&s;h Church. He carried with him &s;ome of Aidan's bones as holy relics. Few te&s;timonies re|main of this prelate's private character; but from tho&s;e few it is evident, he was an intemperate bigot, &s;ullen and re&s;entful, proud, and impatient of contradiction.</P>
<P>During the thirty years this &s;ee had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, we hear of no endow|ments or grants of lands, except the i&s;land of Lindisfarne, for the maintenance of the epi&s;copal dignity, or the mona&s;tic &s;ociety. Oblations, and the gifts of kings in money or cattle, were all the means of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and of tho&s;e they di&s;pen&s;ed frequently to the poor.</P>
<P>TUDA, after Colman had thus di&s;gracefully abdicated the &s;ee, &s;ucceeded, being the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Lindisfarne who held the Romi&s;h modes.

In the year 664, a great eclip&s;e of the &s;un happened on the third day of May, about ten o'clock; and, in the &s;ame year, a horrid pe&s;ti|lence raged, which, pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;outhern parts of Britain, at length reached Northumberland, where great numbers died, among&s;t whom was our &endq;holy prelate.</Q></P>
<P>Bede's remarks on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Scotti&s;h bi&s;hops, ending in Tuda, are too honourable to be omitted. <Q>Their frugality, &s;implicity of life, and par&s;imony,
<PB N="13" REF="55">&startq;appeared in the place of their re&s;idence, in which there was nothing &s;uperflu|ous or unnece&s;&s;ary for the humble&s;t life. In the Church only, magnificence was permitted. Their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in cattle, for money was only re|tained till a fit opportunity offered to di&s;tribute it to the poor. Places of enter|tainment and reception of princes were unnece&s;&s;ary; for the religious were vi|&s;ited &s;olely for their doctrines, and the holy offices of the Church. When the king came there, he was attended only by five or &s;ix per&s;ons, and had no other object in view than to partake of the rites of religion, departing immediately after the &s;ervice: If perchance they took refre&s;hment, it was of the common fare of the monks. The attention of tho&s;e pa&s;tors was confined to &s;piritual matters only: Temporal affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede means the acquiring of lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch worldly concerns.</NOTE> were deemed derogatory to their holy ap|pointment; and thence proceeded the profound veneration which was paid by all ranks of people to the religious habit. When any eccle&s;ia&s;tic went from his mona&s;tery, it was to preach the word of &s;alvation, and he was every where re|ceived with joy, as a me&s;&s;enger of the Divinity: On the road, the pa&s;&s;engers bowed the head, to receive the holy benediction and &s;ign of the Cro&s;s; with pious reverence trea&s;uring up the good man's precepts, as documents of the mo&s;t &s;alutary import.

<P>In 664, the year in which Tuda died, a great change took place in Lindisfarne, which hitherto had been the epi&s;copal &s;eat, and &s;upreme church in Northumber|land; but, upon Cedda's con&s;ecration, York was made the bi&s;hop's re&s;idence, and he a&s;&s;umed the dignity of metropolitan. From this period, for fourteen years, Lindisfarne wanted its proper bi&s;hop<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra.</NOTE>. The mona&s;tery entertained a numerous body of religious, who bore the mo&s;t approved character for their &s;anctity of manners. It is &s;aid that Colman, before his abdication, on behalf of this vene|rable &s;ociety, petitioned O&s;wy to appoint Eata, who then governed the hou&s;e of Melros, to be their abbot. He was one of the twelve youths whom Aidan cho&s;e out of the Angles to educate; and, before Aidan's death, was elected to the go|vernment of Melros.

<P>There are great contradictions touching the time of Cedda's promotion, &s;ome having a&s;&s;erted, that it was obtained through the influence of Egfrid: But this will in no wi&s;e corre&s;pond with the chronology maintained by the be&s;t hi&s;to|rians.
<PB N="14" REF="56">Wharton &s;ays, Cedda pre&s;ided from 664 to 669, which periods were in the reign of O&s;wy, who did not die till the year 670. It is certain he was made bi&s;hop, by the title of Bi&s;hop of York; and he is &s;aid by &s;ome to have received two con&s;ecrations, one during a vacancy of the &s;ee of Canterbury, and the other by Theodore, at York: But the contrary will appear in the &s;equel. Rapin &s;ays, <Q>&startq;O&s;wy's tender affection for his natural &s;on Alcfred, induced him to divide Nor|thumberland again, and make him king of Deira, though contrary to the people's inclination. The Deirians, upon O&s;wy's death, revolted again&s;t Alc|fred, and put them&s;elves under the dominion of Egfrid, who thereby became king of all Northumberland. Alcfred retired into Ireland, where he applied him&s;elf chiefly to his &s;tudies, in expectation of a favourable opportunity to re|cover his dominions." Rapin gives no authority for this; neither is it &s;upport|ed by any of the mona&s;tic writers, except in the words of Bede<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iii. c. 28.</NOTE>. In the mean time Alcfred &s;end Wilfrid his prie&s;t to the king of France, that he might be con|&s;ecrated bi&s;hop in his dominions. Wilfrid making &s;ome &s;tay after his con&s;ecra|tion, O&s;wy, following his &s;on's diligence and example, &s;ent into Kent a holy man, learned in the &s;criptures, of a virtuous life, and a &s;trict ob&s;erver of all religious duties, to be created bi&s;hop of York. He was abbot of Le&s;tingham. On his arrival in Kent, finding Deu&s;dedit archbi&s;hop of Canterbury dead, and no one appointed to the See, he travelled into the country of the We&s;t Saxons, where Wini was bi&s;hop, and by him this virtuous man Cedda was con&s;ecrated, two other bi&s;hops a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the ceremony. Having carefully attended his charge above three years, he was admoni&s;hed by Theodore, who had &s;ucceeded to the metropolitan See of Canterbury, that he was not lawfully and rightfully called to the epi&s;copacy. The good man, with great conde&s;cen&s;ion and humi|lity, at the in&s;tance of O&s;wy, relinqui&s;hed the &s;ee, and retired to his mona&s;tery, from whence he was &s;oon after, by Theodore's influence, made bi&s;hop of Litch|field, A. D. 669." Bede al&s;o &s;ays, "That during his being bi&s;hop of York, he was continually vi&s;iting the cities, towns, and villages, and even conde|&s;cended to &s;ojourn in private hou&s;es, to preach the go&s;pel. He refu&s;ed the in|dulgence &endq;of riding, con&s;tantly making his journies on foot, as the apo&s;tles did.</Q> It appears, that Theodore, to conciliate the minds of O&s;wy and his &s;on, had in|fluenced Cedda's re&s;ignation, in order to give place to Wilfrid. Theodore was born at Tar&s;us in Cilicia, a man of deep erudition and approved morals, and was con&s;ecrated metropolitan by Pope Vitalian. He was the fir&s;t archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury that was univer&s;ally &s;ubmitted to by the Engli&s;h Church; for, preceding his time, the bi&s;hops of the kingdom of Northumberland were independent. On Theodore's vi&s;itation of the northern churches, he reformed their u&s;ages, and cor|rected a multitude of their cu&s;toms. When he objected to Cedda's con&s;ecration, and his having been obtruded on the See of York after Wilfrid was elected to it, and e&s;pecially that he had received con&s;ecration from the Scotti&s;h bi&s;hops, the holy prelate made this mode&s;t reply, <Q>That if he que&s;tioned the manner of his pro|motion
<PB N="15" REF="57">&startq;he was willing to lay down his authority; for that he always thought him&s;elf unworthy of the epi&s;copal character, and took it upon him only in obe|dience &endq;to his &s;uperiors.</Q> Cedda lived after a mo&s;t exemplary and &s;eraphic manner, and, as Bede reports, had a vi&s;it from angels, who di&s;covered to him the time of his death. He al&s;o gives many in&s;tances of his piety, and holy works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iv.</NOTE>. He died March 2, 672, and was interred at Litchfield, where a rich &s;hrine was erected to his memory.</P>
<P>It is remarked by Malm&s;bury, that neither Colman, nor his predece&s;&s;ors Aidan or Finan, notwith&s;tanding they governed the dioce&s;e of York, which had been ad|vanced to a metropolitical privilege, would ever make u&s;e of the pall. Indeed, if they would have taken up this di&s;tinction, they mu&s;t have a&s;&s;umed it by their own act, there being no corre&s;pondence maintained between them and the Pope. For this rea&s;on, Malm&s;bury &s;ays, that when Wilfrid was elected to the See of York with general approbation, he refu&s;ed the appointment, for fear of being obliged to re|ceive his ordination from the Scotti&s;h prelates, looking on them to be little better than &s;chi&s;maticks, which was the rea&s;on of his travelling for his con&s;ecration in|to France<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>WILFRID, as ob&s;erved before, who had been preceptor to Alcfred, and in great favour with him, was born of mean parents in Northumberland, and continued in his father's hou&s;e, without any education, till he was fourteen years of age. On &s;ome di&s;|gu&s;t he fled from his parents, and by accident met with one who had influence at York, to whom his father had rendered &s;ome &s;ervices. This per&s;on ob&s;erving Wilfrid's graceful per&s;on, and the quickne&s;s of his natural genius, recommended him to the queen's protection. Cudda, formerly the king's chamberlain, had re|tired to the mona&s;tery of Lindisfarne, and was become a monk: To him Eanfleda committed the care of Wilfrid's education, who continued at Lindisfarne to the age of eighteen, and afterwards fini&s;hed his &s;tudies at Rome. In order to obtain his ordination to the See of York, he went into France; but tarrying there too long, O&s;wy's patience being exhau&s;ted, Cedda was con&s;ecrated in his ab&s;ence, and Wilfrid, on his return, finding the prelate's chair already occupied, and not willing to oppo&s;e the king's plea&s;ure, retired to the mona&s;tery of Ripon, where he remained till Theodore's vi&s;itation; when, by Cedda's re&s;ignation, he took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the See in peace.</P>
<P>Egfrid's acce&s;&s;ion to the united thrones of Northumberland took place in the year 670. He had been long held in Mercia as an ho&s;tage, whence he returned with his father's victorious army. He had attained his twenty-fifth year when he began to reign, and &s;oon di&s;played a martial genius, with other great powers of mind; but, by an impetuous temper, involved him&s;elf in a &s;eries of troubles and misfortunes. The Mercians had revolted, and put their virtuous prince Peada to death, placing on the throne a creature of their own, who&s;e fir&s;t act of power was
<PB N="16" REF="58">to expel the Northumbrians from his territories. Egfrid, vain of the power &s;o lately gained, and impatient of the injuries done his crown by the revolt, made war upon Mercia, and much blood&s;hed en&s;ued. On the borders of the Trent the armies came to an engagement, in which Elfwin, the Northumbrian king's brother, was &s;lain, with many valiant chieftains, and a va&s;t ho&s;t on both &s;ides<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 138.</NOTE>. Elfwin, who had attained his eighteenth year, was lamented by all, as well for his excellent qualities, as his alliance to both princes, he having married Osfrida, the Mercian king's &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Theodore put a &s;top to the farther effu&s;ion of blood, which had hitherto pro|duced no advantage to either party, and, by a judicious interpo&s;ition, reconciled the contending princes, and brought about a peace on eligible terms.</P>
<P>Soon after his coming to the See of York, Wilfrid founded the mona&s;tery of Hexham, about the year 674, having obtained Hexham&s;hire as a gift to religious u&s;es from Etheldrida, Egfrid's queen. Malm&s;bury &s;ays, <Q>This was crown-land, &startq;&endq;when Wilfrid obtained it of the queen in exchange;</Q> but leaves it in the dark what was given for it. Neither is there any evidence extant of a royal grant of this territory. The church he built there was erected by workmen he brought from Italy and other di&s;tant countries, and dedicated it to St Andrew. Hi&s;torians of that time &s;ay, it exceeded in beauty and elegance every other edifice in the land: They particularly prai&s;e the variety of the buildings, the columns, the car|vings, the oratories, and the crypts. They dwell with wonder on the richne&s;s of the covers for the altar, the gilding of the walls with gold and &s;ilver, and the fine library, collected at a great expence. Etheldrida was daughter of Anna, king of the Ea&s;t-Angles, and was fir&s;t married to Tonbert, a grandee in her father's court, with whom &s;he lived a virgin three years. After his death, at the command of her father, &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed Egfrid, with whom &s;he lived twelve years, but refu&s;ed him connubial rites. This,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iv. c. 19.</NOTE> Bede declares Wilfrid told him, and, for in&s;tance, &s;aid, he of all others could te&s;tify it, for Wilfrid a&s;&s;ured him, the king promi&s;ed to give him lands and great riches $word$ he would per&s;uade the queen to &s;ubmit to his embraces, for he was certain &s;he loved him with the mo&s;t &s;incere affection, and valued him above all men. But in this he did not prevail, &s;he being determined to pre&s;erve her purity; and having an earne&s;t de&s;ire to retire, &s;he frequently en|treated the king's permi&s;&s;ion to dedicate her life to the &s;ervice of Heaven. By re|peated importunities, at length his con&s;ent was obtained, and &s;he entered a mo|na&s;tery where Ebba was abbe&s;s, the king's near relation. Bede &s;ays, this religious hou&s;e &s;tood in a town called Coludi, and that Wilfrid gave the queen the veil and habit. She afterwards became abbe&s;s of Ely, and there &s;pent a mo&s;t exemplary life, practi&s;ing many &s;everities, &s;uch as refu&s;ing the u&s;e of linen and warm baths, and taking but one meal a-day; continuing in the church at her private devotions, after the times of &s;ervice, to a late hour, and, as it is &s;aid, was ble&s;&s;ed with the gift of prophecy. She pre&s;ided abbe&s;s &s;even years, and, dying of the pe&s;tilence, agreeable to her expre&s;s order, was buried in a wooden tomb. After &s;ixteen years,
<PB N="17" REF="59">the body was taken up, to be depo&s;ited in one of marble, when it was found un|corrupted, as Wilfrid, and many others that knew her, te&s;tified, among whom was her phy&s;ician, who had made an inci&s;ion in a tumour under her armpit, the e&s;car of which remained. Many miracles were &s;aid to have been wrought at her tomb. Thomas of Ely<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Elien&s;is, and Angl. Sac. p. 598.</NOTE> &s;ays, that this queen retired to a nunnery at Cawood, near York, where Ebba, king Egfrid's aunt, was abbe&s;s. It appears to be a great er|ror in &s;everal authors, who have placed this Ebba at Coldingham.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed Wilfrid acted a double part in the preceding tran&s;action; for, about this time, he incurred Egbert's &s;evere di&s;plea&s;ure. Thomas of Ely adds, that, about a year after the queen's retreat, the king was very de&s;irous of her re|turn, and de&s;igned to force her out of the mona&s;tery; of which the abbe&s;s recei|ving intelligence, advi&s;ed her to quit the hou&s;e privately, and &s;eek &s;ome more &s;e|cure abode; upon which &s;he retired to Ely; and that the king endeavoured to re|cover her in vain, and, under this di&s;appointment, married Ermenburg, grew very cool towards Wilfrid, and at length expelled him the country. We find an account of this tran&s;action in Eddius's<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eddius, c. xliv.</NOTE> Hi&s;tory of Wilfrid, different from the former; but, as he was his chaplain, he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have wrote favourably of him.

The pope him&s;elf had then no other title than <HI>bi&s;hop of Rome:</HI> But, in the Saxon Annals, to a charter there recited of king Ethelred, this Wilfrid &s;ub&s;cribes him&s;elf, archbi&s;hop of York.

In another place he &s;ays, and is &s;upported by Malm&s;bury, that Ermenburg, Egfrid's &s;econd queen, was Wilfrid's enemy; that &s;he endea|voured to draw an odium upon him, on account of his great revenues in religious hou&s;es, the &s;plendour and number of his retinue, and his co&s;tly living. This charge was enforced &s;o powerfully, as to make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the king, as well as the archbi&s;hop Theodore: But both Eddius and Malm&s;bury liberally charge the archbi&s;hop with bribery, and being a tool of the court. Mo&s;t authors agree, that Wilfrid was intolerably proud, and lived in a &s;tate of magnificence not equalled by princes of that time<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Bede&mdash;Rich. Hagu&s;t.&mdash;Dugdale.</NOTE>. He was artful and in&s;muating, and knew how to po&s;&s;e&s;s the weak moments of zeal and &s;uper&s;tition, and did not &s;pare to &s;olicit, or was always eager to accept, extravagant gifts to the church. He built and ornamented, in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous manner, his churches and abbies, in which he employed foreign arti&s;ts, at a va&s;t expence. His magnificence in other re&s;pects, was in no ways inferior; for the &s;ons of nobles re&s;ided in his hou&s;e for education; his &s;ervants, an infinite number, wore gorgeous apparel; his furniture imitated what he had &s;een in the palaces of foreign potentates, and he was &s;er|ved in ve&s;&s;els of gold. His principal works were, repairing the cathedral of York, the roof of which he covered with lead, and glazed the windows, about the year 670; and building the two magnificent churches of Ripon and Hexham.

<P>Theodore vi&s;iting Northumberland, Rapin &s;ays, <Q>Egfrid complained to him of &startq;Wilfrid, and let him know, that, in&s;tead of edifying the people, he brought a great &s;candal on religion by his pride and arrogance. Theodore finding this a fit opportunity to improve the revenues of his See, and le&s;&s;en tho&s;e of York, which had been dignified with the title of an archbi&s;hopric in the time of Pau|linus, was re&s;olved not to let it &s;lip. Accordingly, without hearing what Wil|frid had to &s;ay for him&s;elf, he depo&s;ed him, and obtained the king's leave to &endq;divide Northumberland into two dioce&s;es.</Q> Whether Theodore was unduly in|fluenced by the court, certain it is, he was very ready to degrade Wilfrid, whom he e&s;teemed his rival. He pretended the mode of Wilfrid's living, and the ex|tent of his dioce&s;e, were too great, and that there was both revenue and people &s;ufficient within the kingdom of Northumberland for four bi&s;hops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier&mdash;Eddius &mdash;Malm&s;b.</NOTE>. The con&s;e|quence of this depo&s;ition was, that York was &s;evered from Lindisfarne, the limits of the latter being confined to Bernicia. And we are al&s;o told, that part of Mercia, being held as an appendage of Northumberland, was then al&s;o created a bi&s;hopric, by the name of Lind&s;ey. Wilfrid's church of Hexham having hitherto received no dignity &s;uperior to that of a mona&s;tic church, was confidered in the above act as a member of Lindisfarne. Upon Theodore's thus cantoning the dioce&s;e of York, Bo&s;a was con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of York, and Eata of Lindisfarne. Eddius reports, that Theodore had no prelate to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the con&s;ecration, which was contrary to the fourth canon of the council of Nice.

<P>Wilfrid, heated with re&s;entment, ha&s;ted to the royal pre&s;ence, to implore a re|dre&s;s of grievances; but his hopes were da&s;hed by the unfavourable countenance &s;hewn him by every one at court. The queen exclaimed again&s;t the rapid increa&s;e of church po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as threatening danger to the &s;tate. The king confe&s;&s;ed he had no criminal charge again&s;t Wilfrid, yet ju&s;tified what Theodore had done on no other principles, than that he was re&s;olved to &s;atisfy his own plea&s;ure, in which he would not be controuled. Wilfrid told the king, his injuries &s;hould not re&s;t there, for that he would appeal to the pope; at which the courtiers bur&s;t into a contemptuous fit of laughter. It &s;eemsby this irreverence, that the court of Eg|frid denied the right of &s;uch appeals; or that it was grown fa&s;hionable, be the enormity ever &s;o great, to flatter the prince's pa&s;&s;ions. Wilfrid &s;till burning with re&s;entment, and di&s;appointed ambition, ha&s;tened into Italy; and, after many cro&s;&s;es in the way, at length he arrived in Rome, where, being well e&s;teemed, he &s;oon obtained a chapter. His &s;ufferings were much condemned, and he returned with the pope's re&s;olution in form for his re&s;toration.</P>

<P>EATA had not long ejoyed his new dignity, before Theodore thought proper to inter|meddle with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his See; and, &s;evering Hexham from Lindisfarne, erected there a new bi&s;hopric. This happened about three years after Wilfrid's departure for Rome, Tumbert being con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of Hexham in the year 680. Eata could not brook this injury; for though he had been advanced to the epi&s;copal dignity by Theodore's authority, and had ri&s;en on the &s;poils of Wilfrid, yet he thought proper on this occa&s;ion to que&s;tion the metropolitan's juri&s;diction, and, in the warmth of re&s;entment, avowed he had no power over the northern churches. Theodore &s;ummoned a convention on the banks of Aln in 684, when Eata, for his contumacy, was depo&s;ed. But Theodore, perhaps afraid of a &s;e|cond appeal to the papal chair, thought it expedient not entirely to degrade a man of &s;uch exalted character, and, to &s;often the rigour of the decree, tran&s;lated him to Hexham; and Tumbert, who had given few te&s;timonies of worth, and had been an adherent of Eata, in denying Theodore's authority, was depo&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel.

Bede repre&s;ents them as a mild and inoffen&s;ive people, con&s;tantly de&s;irous of maintaining peace with Britain: Nor does any au|thor a&s;&s;ign a plau&s;ible pretext for his attacking them. Much blood&s;hed en&s;ued, and the Saxon general, in outrageous cruelty, put the eccle&s;ia&s;tics to death, pilla|ged and de&s;troyed churches and religious hou&s;es. The i&s;landers, at fir&s;t intimi|dated, fled before him; but at length, exa&s;perated by this barbarity, and armed with de&s;pair, they turned upon the Saxons, who were every where di&s;comfited, and beaten back to the coa&s;t; and Bertfred was compelled to embark with the broken remains of his army, having left the flower of the Northumbrian youth dead in this u&s;ele&s;s expedition, in which nothing was purcha&s;ed but an odium up|on the character of Egfrid.</P>
<P>Wilfrid returning to Britain, big with the papal mandate, obtruded him&s;elf on the royal pre&s;ence; but, to his great mortification, found the king exa&s;perated at his in&s;olence: And it appears that Egfrid expre&s;&s;ed his utter contempt of the &s;en|tence, reproached Wilfrid for having procured it by bribery and other illicit means, and, as a pre&s;umptuous offender again&s;t the royal dignity, ordered him into clo&s;e durance.

Wilfrid travelled in|to Mercia, where he was kindly entertained, and had lands given him for erecting and maintaining a mona&s;tery: But he was quickly forced from this retreat; for the Mercian king, who had married Egfrid's &s;i&s;ter, coming to the knowledge of bani&s;hment, ordered him to quit his territories. He then &s;ought protection among&s;t the We&s;t-Saxons, but it was not long before he was again pur&s;ued by Egfrid's re|&s;entment, and his queen's hatred, who &s;ent agents to procure his di&s;lodgment. And thus he was hunted from one country to another, it being impracticable for him to live in any prince's dominions where the Northumbrian monarch had in|fluence.</P>
<P>The South-Saxons were yet Heathens. Wilfrid, under the afflictions of &s;uch enmity and adver&s;ity, was induced to travel into that country to preach the go&s;pel; where the people received a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion in his favour, and entertained a high opinion of his holine&s;s, from a mere accidental circum&s;tance. The country, by a great drought, &s;uffered famine: After having baptized a multitude of people, he kneeled down to prayer, in the open field, and behold abundant &s;howers of rain fell to repleni&s;h the earth. To relieve the immediate hunger of the inhabi|tants, he taught them to fi&s;h with nets, by which means they obtained a comfort|able &s;upply. By his labours among&s;t the South-Saxons it appears, that he wrought their conver&s;ion; for he erected a bi&s;hopric in Sel&s;ey, and continued in that coun|try during Egfrid's life.</P>

By &s;ome he is &s;aid to have been de&s;cended of royal blood in Ireland; his father's name Muriardack, and his mother's Sabina, who, going a pilgrimage, left their &s;on for education at Melros<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Goodwin.</NOTE>. But it is generally agreed that he was born of ob&s;cure parents, and, in his early years, followed the em|ployment of a &s;hepherd. Bede and Turgot (alias Symeon) would not have ne|glected to mention his better birth, as they &s;ought every occa&s;ion to prai&s;e him, had there been any foundation for it. It has been already ob&s;erved, that, whil&s;t feeding his flocks on the banks of Leder, he had a beatific vi&s;ion, and &s;aw St Aidan's &s;pirit a&s;cend up to heaven<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 24.</NOTE>. Whether moved by this &s;upernatural cau&s;e or not, he applied to the abbey of Melros, where, in 651, he gained admittance and initiation, under Eata and Boi&s;ilus, and there became a monk. His exemplary virtue and conduct were &s;uch, that, when Eata was removed from Melros to the abbacy of Lindisfarne, Cuthbert con&s;ented to attend him, and was made prior.

<PB N="21" REF="66">During fourteen years re&s;idence at Melros, the religious fraternity entertained the highe&s;t veneration and love for his character. On Eata's con&s;ecration, Cuthbert became abbot of Lindisfarne, and, as Bede &s;ays, <Q>by his example and diligence, &startq;he in&s;tructed and brought over many to a regular life and di&s;cipline, not only within the limits of the mona&s;tery, but al&s;o in the adjacent country. By his piety and teaching, he laboured to recover the people from their erroneous life and conver&s;ation, in&s;piring them with the true love of holine&s;s, and the hope of heaven. Many at that time had fallen into &s;uper&s;titions, for&s;aking the true faith, and, in the hours of death, and under the tremendous vi&s;itations of the plague, neglecting the holy offices of the church, and the true con&s;olation of religious faith, re&s;orted to &s;orceries and idolatry, endeavouring by inchant|ments and witchcrafts, &s;ecret arts and invocations of the devil, to counteract the vi&s;itations of heaven. To correct &s;uch dreadful errors, this holy father frequently travelled from Lindisfarne, &s;ometimes on hor&s;eback, but more com|monly on foot, and, pa&s;&s;ing into the villages, brought back &s;uch as were fal|len into errors. He had &s;uch powers of elocution, &s;uch a zeal in his exhorta|tions, &s;uch a placid and divine countenance, with penetrating looks, that none dur&s;t &s;tand in his pre&s;ence without confe&s;&s;ing his &s;ins. He was accu&s;tomed to re&s;ort to the meaner habitations among the mountains, where mo&s;t preachers were afraid, or di&s;dained to go, becau&s;e of the wretched dwellings, and mi&s;er|able way of life, as well as ferocity of the inhabitants: Yet he &s;o diligently gave him&s;elf up to this duty, that &s;ometimes, on tho&s;e journies, he did not re|turn to the mona&s;tery for a month together; but, all that time, &s;ojourned among the mountains, with the poore&s;t people, preaching to them, and, by his holy &endq;example, per&s;uading to a religious life.</Q></P>
<P>Cuthbert having dwelt in the mona&s;tery about twelve years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 39.</NOTE>, and conceiving that a mona&s;tic life afforded enjoyments incompatible with contemplation and the &s;ervice of the Deity, retired from thence, and commenced the life of an ancho|rite in the large&s;t of the Farne I&s;lands, which lies oppo&s;ite to Bambrough, and within &s;ight of his mona&s;tery, being di&s;tant from thence only about two leagues. Bede &s;ays, on his going thither, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his brethren, <Q>If I am &startq;permitted, by the grace and goodne&s;s of God, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t there by the labour of my hands, I will gladly abide in that &s;ituation: If that is denied me, I &s;hall quickly return to you." "Now this place was de&s;titute of wood, water, and grain of every kind, and al&s;o unfit for human dwelling, becau&s;e of the wicked &endq;&s;pirits and fiends that haunted it.</Q> With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his brethren he built a cell, with a &s;mall oratory, and &s;urrounded them with a wall, which cut off the view of every object but that of heaven. He could not have cho&s;en a place more adapted to a life of mortification and &s;everity, being on a &s;tormy coa&s;t, &s;ur|rounded by rugged rocks, over which the &s;ea ince&s;&s;antly breaks with horrid tu|mult, de&s;titute of fre&s;h water, without tree for &s;helter or ornament, or &s;hrub bear|ing even the meane&s;t fruit; nothing wherewith to &s;u&s;tain human life; and, to
<PB N="22" REF="67">complete the &s;cene of wretchedne&s;s, &s;aid to be haunted by devils. Miraculous was the change indeed, according to the legend. From the rocks i&s;&s;ued fountains of water; under the tillage of his holy hands, the &s;oil produced barley; trees and &s;hrubs, by his care, flouri&s;hed abundantly; the &s;torms abated, the plains were co|vered with verdure, the evil &s;pirits were bound in eternal darkne&s;s, and mini&s;ters of grace repeatedly vi&s;ited him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The la&s;t i&s;le I vi&s;ited, was the Hou&s;e I&s;land, the &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot where St Cuthbert pa&s;&s;ed the two la&s;t years of his life. Here was afterwards e&s;tabli&s;hed a priory of Benedictines, for &s;ix or eight monks, &s;ubor|dinate to Durham. A &s;quare tower, the remains of a church, and &s;ome other buildings, are to be &s;een there &s;till, and a &s;tone coffin, which it is pretended was that of St Cuthbert. At the no$th end of the i&s;le is a deep cha&s;m, from the top to the bottom of the rock, communicating to the &s;ea; through which, in tempe&s;tuous weather, the water is forced with va&s;t violence and noi&s;e, and forms a fine jet d' eau of &s;ixty feet high. It is called by the inhabitants of the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, the Churn.&mdash;Pennant's Tour in Scotland, p. 38.
<P>In Bede's Life of St Cuthbert, we are told the Saint's cell was not the only erection on the i&s;land, for there was a larger hou&s;e near the landing place, where the brethren, who came to vi&s;it him, lodged. After the death of St Cuthbert, &s;everal per&s;ons &s;ucce&s;&s;ively occupied this hermitage. Thomas, prior of Dur|ham, retired to Farne in the years 1162 and 1163. He had engaged in a controver&s;y with that arrogant pre|late, Hugh bi&s;hop of Durham, touching certain liberties which the monks of that church prompted him to maintain, and who, afterwards de&s;erting him, induced Hugh to procure his depo&s;ition. In the year 1238, Thomas the &s;econd, of Mel&s;onby, &s;ucceeded in Farne I&s;le, where he died. He was elected to the See of Durham, but oppo&s;ed by the king.</P>
<P>In commemoration of the&s;e examples of religious &s;everity, a priory was founded here, &s;ubordinate to Durham, with a revenue of 13 marks from the corporation of Newca&s;tle. The endowment at the di&s;&s;olu|tion was e&s;timated at &pound;. 12 &ratio; 17 &ratio; 8. K. Hen. VIII. in the 33d year of his reign, granted it to the dean and chapter of Durham.&mdash;The remains of the&s;e edifices are very ragged and confu&s;ed, and &s;hew little other than marks of &s;everity and inconvenience, notwith&s;tanding the happy ta&s;te which is denoted in the &s;cites of mo&s;t of the religious hou&s;es of the &s;ame date. A part of a &s;quare tower is &s;tanding, which was built by Thomas Ca&s;tell, prior of Durham, in the beginning of the 15th century. Part of the priory is al&s;o remaining.</P>
<P>The&s;e erections are on the be&s;t part of the i&s;land: A little lawn &s;kirts the edi&s;ices, &s;urrounded with rug|ged rocks, from whence i&s;&s;ues a &s;pring of fre&s;h water. Since the departure of the religious, this i&s;land has returned almo&s;t to its pri&s;tine &s;tate. It con&s;i&s;ts of a few acres in the whole &s;urface, the chief part of which is &s;and and rock. A &s;canty herbage takes place indeed in &s;ome &s;pots, e&s;pecially on the little lawn; but there is neither tree or &s;hrub. The &s;hore is rocky, and &s;ounding to the hollow &s;ea which rolls upon it, &s;ending forth a horrid howling. The north-ea&s;t winds blow fiercely here, and every inclemency of wea|ther known to the climate beats on the&s;e inho&s;pitable &s;hores, which are tremendous from frequent &s;hip|wrecks. There is not a coa&s;t more likely to give one the idea of &s;hoals of wandering &s;pirits, who vi&s;it the <HI>&s;emi&s;epulta o&s;&s;a,</HI> over which they loiter on this &s;ide Styx, whil&s;t unfriendly whirlwinds cover the remains with &s;and, and forbid the funeral rites for which the &s;pirits langui&s;h.&mdash;View of Northumberland.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In this &s;olitude Cuthbert lived for nine years preceding the &s;ynod at Twyford on Aln, where he was elected to the epi&s;copacy in 684. He &s;hewed great reluc|tance to this new dignity, at fir&s;t po&s;itively refu&s;ing the nomination, being de|termined not to quit his cell, and the au&s;terities he had made habitual to him. But upon the king's &s;ailing over to the i&s;land, accompanied by bi&s;hop Trumwine, many nobles and religious, who were pre&s;ent at the &s;ynod, he was prevailed upon by the tears of his &s;overeign, who, with the whole company, are &s;aid to have kneeled, and adjured him in the name of God to take upon him the &s;acred office. He was con&s;ecrated at York, on the 7th day of April, being Ea&s;ter day, in the year 685, and in the 11th of the reign of king Egfrid, who was pre&s;ent at the con&s;ecration. He was fir&s;t made bi&s;hop of Hexham, but having a partiality to Lindisfarne, was tran&s;lated thither, and Eata was &s;ent to Hexham.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="68">
<P>Eata did not long &s;urvive tho&s;e changes. Cuthbert's con&s;ecration was in the la&s;t year of Egfrid's reign, and Eata died in the fir&s;t year of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. There is not an imputation on the life and character of Eata, but that &s;ingle error of incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of the metropolitan, under who&s;e au&s;pices he had recei|ved his dignity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bede, lib. iv. c. 26. lib. v. c. 2. and Anglia Sacra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was the cu&s;tom of Lindisfarne, from the fir&s;t erection of the See, for the bi&s;hop and his clergy to re&s;ide with the abbot and monks; and the monks were, as Bede ob&s;erves, immediately under the bi&s;hop's juri&s;diction, and &s;ometimes the &s;ame per&s;on was both abbot and bi&s;hop. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that Cuthbert's acceptance of this See, after Theodore's &s;everance of the dioce&s;e of York, is by Collier, and other writers, taken up as a cau&s;e of imputation, as a tacit confirma|tion of the wrathful purpo&s;es of Egfrid, again&s;t the per&s;ecuted Wilfrid<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before Cuthbert's con&s;ecration, the northern churches received few endowments of lands. Of the gift of Hexham&s;hire no record is extant; nor of a decennarie, or territory of ten hou&s;eholds for the religious &s;ociety of women at Weremouth; and that at Hartlepool was another for which there is no better authority. But, on the acce&s;&s;ion of Cuthbert to the See of Lindisfarne, a &s;ingular grant was made by Egbert<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 327. v. ii. p. 368.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Haec donatio &s;cripta e&s;t tempore Agathonis Papae, anno aetatis regis Egfridi 40, regni vero ejus 15&deg;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This charter, by &s;ome, is held to be &s;ictitious. Cedde died in the year 664. Sexulfus was not made bi&s;hop of the Mercians till after Ceadda's death, who is al&s;o &s;aid to have &s;igned this charter, and who did not die till 672. See Appendix to Smith's Edit. of Bede's works, No. 22. Though the&s;e circum|&s;tances impeach the authenticity of the record greatly, yet, as it has been accepted by &s;everal grave and learned hi&s;torians, I think it be&s;t to giv$ it a place here, with equal attention, as others have done.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two things are remarkable in this grant; one that it expre&s;&s;es to be made by the advice of the bi&s;hops, and of the whole council; and that it gives the lands and tenements to the bi&s;hop, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in that large and ample tenure, <HI>"ita &s;icut ego habui,"</HI> as fully and amply as the king him&s;elf held the &s;ame. When the nature of the Saxon tenure of lands at that day is con&s;idered, tho&s;e words have a latitude more &s;ingular than at fir&s;t &s;ight they may &s;eem to bear; for they carry with them a &s;pecial juri&s;diction and authority. Be&s;ides the territories included in the preceding grant, Egfrid gave to St Cuthbert's See all the lands from the walls of the church of St Peter in York, to the we&s;t gate of the city, and from the &s;ame church to the city wall on the &s;outh. From this period church-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions began to increa&s;e in the north; the religious were no longer content with oblations, but gra&s;ped after landed property and civil power.</P>
<P>Some &s;hort time preceding St Cuthbert's con&s;ecration, the mona&s;tery of Col|dingham was burnt. The religious &s;ociety there con&s;i&s;ted of monks and nuns, who occupied &s;eparate parts of the edifice. But the &s;evere rules of the hou&s;e were not &s;ufficient to prevent a &s;hameful relaxation of di&s;cipline; in&s;omuch, that the de&s;truction of that &s;tately edifice was con&s;idered a judgment, on the crimes and pollutions of its inhabitants. The mona&s;tery of Lindisfarne looked upon this event with religious horror, and &s;oon after Cuthbert was made bi&s;hop, he forbade the approach of women to the convent, and even denied them acce&s;s to the church, where the monks performed their devotions. He cau&s;ed a &s;mall chapel to be erected on a di&s;tant plain on the i&s;land for their reception, which, from its &s;ituation, was called the green church. Women were afterwards excluded churches or cemeteries where St Cuthbert's body re&s;ted; and &s;ome miraculous puni&s;hments are related which attended infringements on this rule.</P>
<P>Soon after Cuthbert was &s;ettled in the See, Egfrid, from a re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, or ambitious for extent of dominion, levied a great army, and marched into the territories of the Picts, contrary, as &s;aid by &s;everal writers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede&mdash; Rapin &mdash;Cum mul. al.</NOTE>, to the opinion of his council, and the prophetic admonitions of his bi&s;hop, who foretold the ruinous con&s;equence of the expedition. He ravaged the borders, and, flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, pur&s;ued the flying enemy into the heart of the country, among mountains and de|files, to which his people were &s;trangers, and where little or no forage was to be obtained. When his troops were fainting with fatigue and famine, he under&s;tood, too late, that the flying natives had only made a feint to draw him forward, whil&s;t their main body &s;eized tho&s;e defiles and &s;traits in the mountains by which he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily return. He was con&s;trained to fight his way at a great di&s;advantage, and fell in the field, with half of his army. The Picts pur&s;ued their advantage,
<PB N="25" REF="70">and regained all that exten&s;ive territory the Northumbrians had at different pe|riods annexed to their crown. From this fatal overthrow, the throne of Northum|berland began to dimini&s;h in power and &s;plendour, and never afterwards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e exten&s;ive bounds of dominion which it did at the commencement of Eg|frid's reign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The place of this defeat is by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to be on the banks of Solway Frith, and by others al|ledged to be further northward, which they &s;upport by Hi$ being the place of Egfrid's &s;epulture. &mdash;Bor|der Hi&s;t.&mdash;Bede&mdash;Symeon, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

<P>Egfrid, though twice married, left no i&s;&s;ue; his brother Alcfrid, coming from his retreat in Ireland, a&s;cended the throne. The queen, Ermenburga, according to Symeon and others, was profe&s;&s;ed in the nunnery at Carli&s;le, Cuthbert giving her the veil.</P>
<P>Cuthbert enjoyed his change of life and dignities but a very &s;hort time; for, within two years, finding his health declining, and his mind being by habit tem|pered more for &s;olitude and &s;ilence than the duties of his high office, he re&s;igned the See, and returned to his cell in Farne, where he &s;urvived only two months, departing this life on the 20th day of March 687, in the 53d year of the erection of the See of Lindisfarne, and 37 years after he had a&s;&s;umed the mona&s;tic habit at Melros<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wharton, Goodwin, &amp;c.&mdash;In the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, N^o 247 and 260, and in Gib&s;on's edit. of the Britannia, a curious jewel, repre&s;enting St Cuthbert, is de&s;eribed, found near Athelney in So|mer&s;et&s;hire.

<P>Mr Wallis, &s;peaking of this portrait, has the following remarks:&mdash; <Q>King Alfred preferred the&s;e cha|racters &startq;to the Saxon, and when he &s;wayed the &s;ceptre, brought them into u&s;e. This curious memorial of St Cuthbert was found in the very place of that glorious monarch's retreat and deliveran$$ from the &endq;Danes, fortified by him in the time of war, and in the time of peace converted into a mona&s;tery.</Q> Dr Mu&s;grave (who wrote a di&s;&s;ertation thereon), thinks this curious Cimolium an undeniable in&s;tance of the u&s;e of images coming from the Heathens into the Chri&s;tian church. Dr Hickes has engraven it in his The|&s;aurus, and is of opinion, that the occa&s;ion of it was the vi&s;ion of St Cuthbert, which William of Malm&s;|bury &s;peaks of, appearing to him and his mother the &s;ame night, (a&s;ter he had been beaten by the Danes, and retired into Athelney), and a&s;&s;uring him that he &s;hould be a grent king. In memory whereof we may well &s;uppo&s;e, that the image upon it is St Cuthbert's, (to who&s;e merit he was wont to afcribe his future &s;ucce&s;&s;es over the Danes), and not only &s;o, but being plainly made, on purpo&s;e to hang on a &s;tring, it is very probable that him&s;elf con&s;tantly wore it, in honour to this his t$telar faint.&mdash;It is &s;aid to be now in the A&s;hmolean Mu&s;eum at Oxford.&mdash;See Archaeologia, vol. ii. p. 68.72.</P>

<P>So dear was this &s;aint to King Alfred, that he made him &s;hare with him in his &s;overeignty, and honoured his name upon his coin, &s;tamped on one &s;ide with AELFRED REX; on the other, CVDBERHT.</P></NOTE>.

But the monks of Lindisfarne prevailed with the bi&s;hop to permit his body to be interred in their church, where it was depo&s;ited with great funeral pomp, fir&s;t in the cemetery of the old church, and afterwards, on occa&s;ion of the cathedral being rebuilt, on the right &s;ide of the high altar.

<P>Archbi&s;hop Theodore, declining in health and &s;trength, grew anxious to relieve his con&s;cience from the &s;everities he had exerci&s;ed again&s;t Wilfrid, &s;ought there|fore to regain his friend&s;hip; and, through his intere&s;t with the king, and earne&s;t &s;olicitations in his favour, obtained his re&s;toration. At Wilfrid's return into the Northumbrian dominions, the king put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his church of Hex|ham, St John of Beverley having vacated that See on his tran&s;lation to York. It appears that Wilfrid, during a vacancy of one year, exerci&s;ed the epi&s;copal func|tion for Lindisfarne, until the con&s;ecration of Eadbert. In a &s;hort time after|wards, he was re&s;tored to the See of York. He had no &s;ooner re-a&s;&s;umed this dignity, than his ungovernable ambition and arrogance blazed out a-new. The See of York, at his fir&s;t a&s;&s;umption of the epi&s;copal dignity, held in unity the kingdom of Northumberland: At his re&s;toration, it &s;tood di&s;membered. He made injudicious preten&s;ions and claims to effect a re-union of Hexham and Lin|disfarne, &s;o as that the whole eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction might be compri&s;ed in the church of York; which &s;o exa&s;preated the king, and was a thing &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the politics of the times, that he was again expelled, and obliged to fly the realm. Collier, from the authority of Eddius, ch. 43. and 44. &s;ays, The grounds of this rupture were, <Q>becau&s;e the king had &s;ecularized part of the revenues of &startq;St Peter's church of York, di&s;&s;olved the mona&s;tic in&s;titution of Hexham, and taken away the privileges granted by the crown, and confirmed by Pope Aga|tho: And, la&s;tly, that the king would compel Wilfrid to be &s;ubject to the or|ders and injunctions of Theodore. Wilfrid refu&s;ing to comply with &s;uch au|thority, &endq;and in&s;i&s;ting on re&s;titution in the other matters, was bani&s;hed.</Q> EADBERT was con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of Lindisfarne in 688. He was a learned man, of ex|emplary life and piety, and a mo&s;t humane and charitable di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the year 690, Theodore departed this life at the age of eighty-eight. Among&s;t the many laudable works he accompli&s;hed, two are of chief con&s;equence to po&s;te|rity. He was a great encourager of learning, and liberal education, for which purpo&s;e he e&s;tabli&s;hed public &s;chools, and collected from abroad a very valuable library, both of Greek and Latin authors, &s;ome of the manu&s;cripts remaining to this day<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Antiq.

The oblations and gifts of the people, which fir&s;t aro&s;e in benevolence, as acts of piety, were grown, by u&s;age and cu&s;tom, into a right, and now advanced into the firmer title of or|dinance. It is from thence that modern lawyers &s;ay, that tythes are due of com|mon right, as having exi&s;ted from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of churches, and made regular from the divi&s;ion of parochial limits. To return to Wilfrid:&mdash;</P>
<P>In his &s;econd bani&s;hment, he &s;ought refuge in the court of Mercia, where he won upon the ear of Etheldred, and gained from him the bi&s;hopric of Leice&s;ter. Adver&s;ity is &s;aid to be the &s;chool of wi&s;dom, but it did not prove &s;o to Wilfrid; for, in his new &s;tation, he conducted him&s;elf with &s;uch in&s;olence and impropriety, that he incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Mercian king and the archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, who brought him to judgment before a &s;ynod.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of convening this a&s;&s;embly, it is thought, was to per&s;uade Wilfrid<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collier's Antiq. Britain&mdash;Eddius.</NOTE> to re&s;ign his bi&s;hopric; and, if they could not prevail upon him, the next point was to get him condemned by a majority of the bi&s;hops, that &s;o the odium of expel|ling him from the metropolitan See might be taken off from the king. In Wilfrid's defence, he reproached the Synod with open oppo&s;ition to the authority of the See of Rome, for two and twenty years together. The fir&s;t &s;entence this Synod pronoun|ced again&s;t him, and which was agreed to by the king and the archbi&s;hop, was, <HI>That he &s;hould be di&s;&s;eized of all his revenues, both in the kingdoms of the Northum|brians and Mercians.</HI> The &s;everity of this judgment &s;tartled &s;ome of the mo&s;t ten|der con&s;ciences, and, after a remon&s;trance, it was &s;o far mitigated, that Wilfrid &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s his mona&s;tery of Ripon, if he would bind him&s;elf not to go out of its precincts without the king's leave, nor execute any part of the epi&s;copal function. Wilfrid exclaimed vehemently again&s;t the&s;e proceedings, and declared his re&s;olution to appeal to Rome for redre&s;s. He was now 70 years of age, and yet his powers were &s;o little debilitated, and his pa&s;&s;ions continued &s;o warm, that he again journeyed to Rome, where, in &s;pite of the character of a turbulent and contentious prelate, which he carried along with him, he obtained a decree for his re&s;toration. Returning a &s;econd time with the papal mandate, and at a more propitious &s;ea&s;on to obtain the reward of his labour, the archbi&s;hop found it con|venient to acquie&s;ce; for the Mercian king had a&s;&s;umed the habit of a monk; and the king of Northumberland, under the attacks of a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, feel|ing compunctions for the &s;ufferings of Wilfrid, was reconciled to him.</P>
<P>During this time, Eadbert, with a &s;oul full of benevolence, di&s;covering that the exaction of the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, (church-dues or tythes, as the word is variou&s;ly con|&s;trued),
<PB N="29" REF="74">from the lower cla&s;&s;es of people, was become a grievance, made it a ge|neral rule to re&s;tore them to the poor. He began, and lived to complete, the ca|thedral of Lindisfarne, which he built of &s;tone, and covered with lead, the re|mains of which are &s;till &s;tanding, as repre&s;ented in the annexed plate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cathedral is in the form of a cro&s;s, the ea&s;t and we&s;t limbs of which are yet &s;tanding, the other parts totally in ruins, and almo&s;t level with the ground. The order of building in this &s;tructure is rude and heavy, and mo&s;t of it in the wor&s;t mode of the early Saxon architecture. Mr Gro&s;e &s;ays, "Probably it was the work of different periods; great part of it &s;eems very ancient, the arches being circular, and the columns very ma&s;&s;y, and much like tho&s;e at Durham, but richer. On the north and &s;outh walls there are pointed arches, which proves, that part of it at lea&s;t was built &s;ince the reign of Henry II. The de|&s;truction made by the Danes occa&s;ioned much of this variety to take place. The pillars on which the arches ri&s;e in the centre of the cro&s;s, are clu&s;tered, and plain capitalled, being the corner &s;upporters of the great tower. The&s;e arches are of few members. The chancel &s;eems to be of more modern architecture, with painted windows, and no &s;ide ailes, and perhaps took date, as Mr Gro&s;e ob&s;erves, after the reign of King Henry II. when this church became a cell of monks, &s;ubordinate to Durham. The nave of the church con|&s;i&s;ts of a wide centre, and two &s;ide ailes, the columns of which are heavy, and the arches circular. In the &s;uper&s;tructure of the north and &s;outh walls, pointed arches appear. The windows are narrow, ornamented with a corner pila&s;ter, and a moulding of few members. The walls are very thick, and every part wears a gloomy countenance. The &s;outh wall of the middle tower is &s;tanding, about fi&s;ty feet high; and one corner tower, on the we&s;t end of the church, remains perfect. The&s;e ruins &s;till retain one mo&s;t &s;ingular beauty: Under the tower was a fine canopy arch, a vault or dome, with ribs or bows &s;pringing from the angles, and cro&s;&s;ing each other diagonally. One of the arches yet &s;tands, unloaded with any &s;uper&s;truc|ture, &s;upported by the &s;outh-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t corner pillars, and ornamented with the dancette or zig|zag moulding, much u&s;ed in the old Saxon architecture, &s;tretching a fine bow over the cha&s;m and ruins oc|ca&s;ioned by the falling in of the ailes. The chief parts of the &s;tructure are compo&s;ed of a &s;oft red free|&s;tone, which yields much to time, and renders the a&s;pect of the building dark and melancholy. Mr Gro&s;e's account comprehends the following particulars:&mdash;"Various fragments of the offices of this mona&s;tery are &s;till &s;tanding, and foundations of buildings are &s;eattered over a clo&s;e of near four acres. The main walls of the church, on the north and &s;outh &s;ides, are &s;till &s;tanding, though much out of the perpendicular, in|clining outwards &s;o con&s;iderably, as to make the horizontal di&s;tance between them at the top exceed, by near two feet, that at the bottom. Another winter or two &s;eems to be the utmo&s;t they can &s;tand. This building con&s;i&s;ts of a body and two &s;ide ailes, into which it is divided by a double row of very &s;olid co|lumns, who&s;e &s;hafts are richly ornamented. Each row has five columns, of four different con&s;tructions, and two pila&s;ters in the walls on the ea&s;t and we&s;t ends;" (this he &s;peaks of the nave). "The &s;hafts of the&s;e columns are about twelve feet high, their diameters about five: Their capitals and pede&s;tals are plain; they &s;upport circular arches, having over each arch two ranges of windows; the lowe&s;t, large, and in pairs, &s;eparated only by a &s;hort column; the upper, &s;mall and &s;ingle. The length of the building is about 138 feet, the breadth of the body 18 feet, and that of the two &s;ide ailes, about 9 feet each."
<P>The pro&s;pect from this i&s;land is beautiful: To the northward you command the town of Berwick, over an arm of the &s;ea, about &s;even miles in breadth. At near the &s;ame di&s;tance, to the fouth, you view Bam|brough Ca&s;tle, on a bold promontory.

<P>EADFRID, or, agreeable to &s;ome authors, Egfridth, was the next who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the See, a monk of Lindisfarne, and one of the mo&s;t learned men of his time. He tran&s;|lated the Go&s;pels into Latin; which work, after his death, was highly decorated by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, with gold and jewels. Bilfrid, an hermit, illuminated it with various paintings, and rich devices; and Adred, a prie&s;t, interlined it with a Sax|on ver&s;ion.

Under this learned prelate's patronage, the venerable Bede wrote the life of St Cuthbert. Bede undertook to remon&s;trate to the bi&s;hop on his neglect of the duties of his high office; for though he had, &s;oon after his co|ming to the See, through his veneration for the memory of St Cuthbert, repaired and beautified his little oratory on Farne, yet he did not follow &s;o clo&s;ely his ex|emplary life, as Bede conceived he ought to have done, for the honour of reli|gion; whereupon he took upon him to dictate to the prelate. The epi&s;tle wrote on this occa&s;ion was &s;aid to be the means of Eadfrid's attending more &s;trictly to his &s;tudies; and from that time he tran&s;lated a great part of the Go&s;pels into the Saxon language, for an ea&s;ier communication to the people. Bede's maxims were well adapted to the age, and are &s;till not unin&s;tructive to prelates of more modern and learned times. The &s;ubjects of his expo&s;tulation were chiefly the importance of a bi&s;hop's duty, and the greatne&s;s of the charge which he had a&s;&s;umed. He entreated him to recogni&s;e the divine commi&s;&s;ion, as being the ordination of the great mi&s;&s;ionary of Heaven; that he &s;hould rebuke the proud in the vanity of their high &s;tation, and in&s;truct them in the duties of humiliation; that they &s;hould not erect churches for the &s;ake of popular admiration and worldly honour, but as works of piety only, for the propagation of religion and virtue; that he &s;hould vi&s;it his clergy, and reprove, or lop off, tho&s;e branches which were contaminated with the vices of the age; and that his lei&s;ure hours &s;hould be appropriated to acts of devotion and &s;tudy, and not &s;acrificed to plea&s;ures, luxuries, and u&s;ele&s;s ea&s;e<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Angl.

<P>Eadulph, a lord of the country, taking advantage of O&s;red's youth, made an attempt to u&s;urp the throne, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a powerful party, who proclaimed him king. This obliged O&s;red and his guardian to &s;hut them&s;elves up in Bambrough Ca&s;tle, where the un&s;kilful u&s;urper immediately be&s;ieged them; and, in&s;tead of marching through the country, &s;eizing the &s;trong-holds, and receiving allegiance from the people, he wa&s;ted his time in a fruitle&s;s attempt to take this impregnable fortre&s;s, which gave the king's friends an opportunity to recover from their &s;ur|pri&s;e, and a means of levying troops for the defence of their lawful &s;overeign. It was not long before Eadulph di&s;covered his party was weakened, the populace were de&s;erting him, and his cau&s;e more perilous than he at fir&s;t conceived.

<P>Rapin &s;ays, O&s;ric on his demi&s;e left his crown to his cou&s;in Ceolwlph; but the fact &s;eems to be, that, by the election of the people, CEOLWLPH a&s;cended the throne in the year 730. He was a lineal de&s;cendent of Ida, from Ogga, his elde&s;t illegitimate &s;on. At this time the kingdom of Northumber|land was undi&s;turbed by the northern nations. The Picts had entered into a treaty with the Engli&s;h, and tho&s;e clans of Scots who dwelt in Britain, kept quiet within their own frontiers, and attempted nothing upon the Northumbrians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 63.</NOTE>. As for the Britons, they refu&s;ed all friendly corre&s;pondence, hated the Engli&s;h up|on the &s;core of the old quarrel, and refu&s;ed to conform to the Romi&s;h u&s;age of keeping Ea&s;ter. Bede &s;ays, <Q>Now all war and tumult cea&s;ing, and unity and &startq;concord univer&s;ally prevailing, many of Northumberland, as well of the nobi|lity as lower cla&s;&s;es, laying a&s;ide the u&s;e of arms, became, both they and their &endq;&s;ons, religious men.</Q> The king was a pious man, and &s;pent his days in de|vout exerci&s;es: The reins of government were relaxed; a religious enthu&s;ia&s;m po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the people; and that ab&s;tracted indolence took place, in which neither arts or &s;ciences, cultivation of land, or manufactories, advanced. The common|wealth mu&s;t always &s;uffer under an over-heated zeal, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic religion. The king being ever at his devotions, the nobles catched the infatuation, and con|ceiving &s;elf-denial, mortification, and neglect of worldly concerns, mo&s;t accept|able to Heaven, they founded religious hou&s;es, built churches, and took on them the mona&s;tic habits. Tho&s;e who &s;hould have appeared in the &s;everal depart|ments of government, were &s;unk into cells, and the &s;tate lo&s;t its nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|ports. The enthu&s;ia&s;m al&s;o extended to the lower cla&s;&s;es. Bede &s;eems to have had a prophetic &s;pirit of the evil con&s;equences which would en&s;ue; but it was not &s;uited to his &s;tation, to pronounce again&s;t an error on which the power and grow|ing wealth of religious hou&s;es depended. He &s;aw, however, that mona&s;teries, unle&s;s their numbers and conduct were attended to by the legi&s;lature, would prove an injury both to church and &s;tate. This appears by his letter to Egbert, bi&s;hop of York, written &s;ome few years after his eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory. After &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity there was for encrea&s;ing epi&s;copal Sees, he &s;ays, <Q>There are &startq;&endq;mona&s;teries enough that ought to &s;pare part of their e&s;tates for &s;uch u&s;es;</Q> and th$r fore, <Q>he thought it rea&s;onable &s;ome of their lands &s;hould be taken from &startq;them, and laid to the bi&s;hopric; e&s;pecially as many of them &s;ell &s;hort of the $$le$ of their in&s;titution: And &s;ince it was commonly &s;aid, that &s;everal of tho$e places were not &s;erviceable to God or the commonwealth, becau&s;e nei|ther $$e exerci&s;es of piety and di&s;cipline were practi&s;ed, nor the e&s;tates po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed

He complains farther, That the mona&s;teries were frequently filled with people of un&s;uitable practices; that the country &s;eemed over&s;tocked with tho&s;e foundations; that there were &s;carce e&s;tates enow left for the laity of condition; and that if this humour in|crea&s;ed, the country would become unfurni&s;hed of troops to defend their fron|tiers." He adds, "That &s;everal per&s;ons of quality among&s;t the laity, who had neither choice or experience of a mona&s;tic life, u&s;ed to purcha&s;e crown-lands, under pretence of founding a mona&s;tery, and then obtain a charter of privi|leges, &s;igned by the king, the bi&s;hops, and other great men in church and &s;tate; by the&s;e expedients working together a great e&s;tate, and making them|&s;elves lords of &s;everal villages; and thus getting them&s;elves di&s;charged from the &s;ervices of the common-wealth, they retired for liberty and ea&s;e, took the range of their fancy, a&s;&s;umed the character of abbots, and governed a race of monks, without any ju&s;t pretence to &s;uch authority: And, what was &s;till more irregular, they, in &s;ome in&s;tances, had not &s;tocked tho&s;e places with per&s;ons properly denominated by the title of religious, but raked together a &s;ociety of &s;trolling monks, expelled other convents for their mi&s;behaviour; and, in other in&s;tances, they had per&s;uaded their own retinue to take the ton&s;ure and promi&s;e a mona&s;tic obedience: And, having furni&s;hed their religious hou&s;es with &s;uch ill-cho&s;en company, they lived a life perfectly &s;ecular, under a mona&s;tic cha|racter; bringing their wives into the mona&s;teries, and were hu&s;bands and ab|bots at the &s;ame time. That, for about thirty years after the death of king Alcfrid, the country had run riot in this manner; in&s;omuch, that there were very few of the lord-lieutenants, or governors of towns, who had not &s;eized the religious juri&s;diction of &s;ome mona&s;tery, and put their ladies in the &s;ame predicament of guilt, by making them abbe&s;&s;es, without pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;tages of di&s;cipline and retirement that ought to qualify them for it. And, as ill cu&s;toms are apt to &s;pread, the king's menial &s;ervants had taken up the &s;ame fa&s;hion. And thus we find a great many incon&s;i&s;tent offices and titles became incorporated. The &s;ame per&s;ons were abbots and mini&s;ters of &s;tate; and the &endq;court and cloi&s;ter were un&s;uitably tacked together.</Q> To &s;top the growth of this di&s;order, Bede advi&s;es <Q>the convening of a &s;ynod; that a vi&s;itation might &startq;&endq;be begun, and all &s;uch unqualified per&s;ons thrown out of the u&s;urpation.</Q> He reminds the bi&s;hop, <Q>That it is part of the epi&s;copal office to in&s;pect the &startq;mona&s;teries of his dioce&s;e; to reform whatever is erroneous, both in the prin|cipals and inferiors, and not to &s;uffer a breach of the rules of the in&s;titution.

<P>The reader will pardon this digre&s;&s;ion, as it has &s;uch pointed reference to &s;e|veral of tho&s;e religious in&s;titutions, to which, in the cour&s;e of this work, parti|cular attention mu&s;t be given. This letter al&s;o &s;hews, it was an e&s;tabli&s;hment of the earlie&s;t church, that the di&s;cipline and reformation of mona&s;teries belonged not to the &s;ecular juri&s;diction, but to the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e only, unle&s;s the monks were guilty of a crime again&s;t the &s;tate.</P>
<P>About this time the Saxons were grown &s;o intolerably licentious, giving them|&s;elves up to luxury and intemperance, that they were the objects of the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;piritual reprehen&s;ion. It &s;eems their di&s;&s;olute manners were &s;uch, as ren|dered them contemptible in foreign countries. Boniface, archbi&s;hop of Mentz, wrote a letter of remon&s;trance to this country, charging one of the Saxon &s;ove|reigns with want of &s;obriety, and a total relaxation of virtuous conduct; that he lived unmarried, and in a &s;tate of incontinence, having tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed all religious principles &s;o far as to be guilty of ravi&s;hing the nuns; from which pernicious ex|ample, &s;ociety was injured, and the name of Chri&s;tianity brought into reproach. The Heathens, he ob&s;erved, re&s;trained them&s;elves from &s;uch heinous offences, and regarded the marriage-vow with the mo&s;t &s;acred reverence. Among&s;t the old Saxons, if a maid lo&s;t her virtue, and di&s;honoured her family, or a married wo|man was convicted of adultery, they forced them to be their own executioners, and &s;trangle them&s;elves, to wipe out the di&s;grace and ignominy; and, as an hor|rid example, their bodies were burnt to a&s;hes; and the man who &s;educed them was hung over the &s;moaking remains. From &s;uch pernicious examples as pre|vailed at the time of this pious prelate's letter, he avowed that vice would grow into enormity, and become an entail on future ages; that po&s;terity would catch the infection, and wickedne&s;s grow univer&s;al, by which the people would be &s;unk to the la&s;t degree of depravity and wretchedne&s;s; devoid of con&s;cience, honour, and courage, they would become traitors at home, and cowards in the field, and, in the end, de&s;picable to God and man; a &s;triking example of which was then exhibited in the Spaniards and Burgundians. Such was the &s;pirit of this pious remon&s;trance.</P>
<P>The depravity cen&s;ured by the good bi&s;hop did not e&s;cape the female &s;ex; for, in Boniface's letter to Cuthbert, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, there is an ac|count of the di&s;&s;olute life of &s;ome of the women of this age, <Q>who u&s;ed to &startq;travel upon pretence of religion, and go in pilgrimage to Rome: To prevent which, he in&s;i&s;ted the church and &s;tate ought to forbid all women that had taken the veil from &s;trolling into foreign countries; averring that the greate&s;t part of the&s;e travellers made a mi&s;erable voyage, and left their honour in
<PB N="37" REF="82">their pilgrimage; there being few cities, either in Lombardy or France, in which &s;ome of tho&s;e Engli&s;h pro&s;titutes were not to be met with; which is a &endq;&s;hame and &s;candal,</Q> &s;ays he, "to your whole church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boniface's letters.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>So much it was nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, from the&s;e great authorities in church-hi&s;tory, at this period, when it appears the infatuation for religious profe&s;&s;ion prevailed &s;o greatly with both &s;exes in Northumberland. But to return to Ceo|lwlph.</P>
<P>Ethelbald, the king of Mercia, ob&s;erving the unhappy condition of the neigh|bouring empire, determined to make his advantage of it, and with a powerful army entered Northumberland. He ravaged the borders, &s;acked and laid wa&s;te their cities, and, loaden with &s;poils, returned in triumph; whil&s;t the Northum|brians, as idle &s;pectators, di&s;regarded the wreck of empire; many of them, be|ing infatuated zealots, received their afflictions as the di&s;cipline and &s;courge of Heaven, e&s;teeming them &s;alutary mortifications, wherein they &s;hould find &s;piri|tual comfort. Anarchy and confu&s;ion took place, and the &s;tate was ha&s;tening to di&s;&s;olution, when the king, in a phrenzy of zeal, after having reigned eight years, abdicated the throne, and offered his crown at the high altar in the church of Lindisfarne, where he a&s;&s;umed the cowl in 738<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bede&mdash;Malmf.&mdash; Symeon&mdash;&amp;c.</NOTE>.

We are told he procured an improvement in the living of the monks, gaining the u&s;e of ale and wine, in the room of water and milk, which were the only li|quors they were permitted to have, under the rules in&s;tituted by Aidan, their founder<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Hove|den&mdash;Bede&mdash;Con.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Not having any i&s;&s;ue, Ceolwlph is &s;aid to have bequeathed his &s;ceptre to his cou&s;in-german Edbert, the &s;on of Eata, who &s;ucceeded him. Entering into a &s;piritual life might at that time have been e&s;teemed an extinction of temporal rights.

<P>EDBERT a&s;cended the throne in 737, when the realm was in the mo&s;t relaxed and impo|tent &s;tate: All the neighbouring powers were committing continual depreda|tions on his &s;ubjects, who, like men of di&s;turbed rea&s;on, bowed their &s;imple heads to every affliction, and put their hands in their bo&s;oms, void of &s;elf-de|fence, the tributary &s;tates declaring for freedom and independence. His coro|nation was immediately followed by an inva&s;ion of the Picts on the northern fron|tiers. Obliged to march with all po&s;&s;ible expedition to oppo&s;e them, the Mer|cians took advantage of the circum&s;tance, entered the &s;outhern parts of Northum|berland, and carried off a large booty.</P>
<P>How difficult a ta&s;k it was to rou&s;e the lethargic zealots from their fa&s;cination, and drive them to arms, may ea&s;ily be conceived.

<P>Our bi&s;hop, of whom we have few memorials, departed this life at Lindi&s;|farne, in the year 740, and was &s;ucceeded by CYNEWOLF, who was elected the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>Two year after his con&s;ecration, the royal monk Ceolwlph departed this life at Lindisfarne.

<P>Two things are remarkable in this event; the fir&s;t, that of Offa's taking re|fuge at the tomb of St Cuthbert. This is the fir&s;t in&s;tance of &s;anctuary we meet with in the hi&s;tory of this church; and we do not find that it was a privilege
<PB N="39" REF="84">granted by any &s;overeign, but merely aro&s;e from the &s;anctity and veneration in which the &s;aint's remains were held. The privilege of &s;anctuary has been ex|claimed again&s;t with great virulence, as being an exten&s;ion of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;|diction incon&s;i&s;tent with true policy. It had good con&s;equences in tho&s;e days, as it allowed the criminal time for making re&s;titution, or, under the Saxon laws, he mu&s;t have &s;uffered immediate pains and puni&s;hments: It was the proce&s;s by which the rigour of common law was moderated, and, when kept in due re&s;traint, was of great benefit to mankind: But, by an enormous exten&s;ion which took place, it produced infinite mi&s;chiefs to the community.</P>
<P>The other remarkable matter was, the impri&s;onment of a bi&s;hop, and the ex|ertion of regal power therein again&s;t the church, without a convention.</P>
<P>Edbert, in the 18th year of his reign, entered into a league with the King of the Picts, and, with their united forces, they laid &s;iege to the city of Alcluyth, afterwards called Dunbarton, which, in Alcfrid's reign, had been wre&s;ted from the realm by the Welch. On the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, the Britons, who held the place, unable to oppo&s;e &s;uch powerful a&s;&s;ailants, &s;urrendered it; and Deovania, who headed a Welch reinforcement, which was coming up to relieve the garri&s;on, was intercepted, and the greate&s;t part of his troops put to the &s;word. Edbert was a prince of eminent talents, and high reputation. Pepin, king of France, his co|temporary, is &s;aid to have kept up a corre&s;pondence with him, and cultivated his friend&s;hip by many royal pre&s;ents. In the twenty-fir&s;t year of his reign, when he had re&s;tored peace to his kingdom, when his days were full of honour,&mdash;when his fame had pa&s;&s;ed abroad through many nations,&mdash;at a time he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his people's highe&s;t veneration and love, and his crown was adorned with the brighte&s;t gems of virtue and illu&s;trious actions, he was &s;eized with the religious infatuation of the age, abdicated the throne, and retired to a mona&s;tery in York, leaving his &s;ceptre to his &s;on. In this retreat he lived ten years, enjoying, until the time of his death, the daily intercour&s;e and &s;piritual conver&s;e of Egbert his bro|ther, bi&s;hop of York, who departed this life &s;ome &s;hort time after the royal re|clu&s;e.

A per&s;on not of the royal lineage being &s;upported on the throne, was a precedent for all the great men to a&s;pire to the government, as they adopted an idea, they were as well entitled to the crown, from natural right, as the princes of the blood, the &s;overeignty being elective in the people.

Some of the nobles who were not of Mollo's intere&s;t, as he a&s;&s;umed the diadem by means of a powerful party, thought it allowable for them to make the like attempt.

<P>HEATHURED &s;ucceeded to the See, during who&s;e prelacy the great event before mentioned, the acce&s;&s;ion of Northumberland to the crown of Egbert, took place.</P>
<P>This material revolution claims the reader's attention to a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion, in or|der that he may proceed regularly to the time when the crown of Northumber|land was degraded, and worn by a viceroy.</P>
<P>Egbert, &s;on of Alchmund, de&s;cended from E&s;a, Eoppa, Inigi&s;il, Cemed, who was the fourth from Ceaulin, was become very popular in We&s;&s;ex, during the reign of Brithric, who, growing jealous of his ri&s;ing merit, determined to remove him. Egbert, gaining information of the &s;nares laid for him, fled into Mercia, and from thence to France, where he remained twelve years, attending to tho&s;e &s;tudies which might not only poli&s;h and adorn his mind, but al&s;o accompli&s;h him in the knowledge of the true intere&s;ts of the nations of Europe, of the interior wealth of &s;tates, of civil polity, and tho&s;e maxims and laws which would render a growing people powerful, rich and happy. It is pre&s;umed by &s;everal authors, that, during this retreat, he formed the project of uniting the &s;tates of the hep|tarchy. In the year 799, Brithric was poi&s;oned by his queen Edburga, which ca|ta&s;trophe accelerated Egbert's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. His fir&s;t attention was to train, arm, and di&s;cipline his troops, after the mode and military art he had &s;een practi&s;ed in France, and of which he had acquired a perfect knowledge<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Higden, 251.&mdash;Malm&s;.</NOTE>. When he had thus not only brought his &s;ubjects into a new array and di&s;cipline, but al&s;o thereby fully di&s;covered the &s;trength of his kingdom, he began to arrange what was nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of his project. He travelled through the different di&s;tricts of his dominions, in&s;pected and &s;ettled all matters relative to govern|ment and civil polity, relieved the oppre&s;&s;ed, puni&s;hed the officers in the &s;everal
<PB N="48" REF="93">departments of civil juri&s;diction who had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws, and harra&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject; cheri&s;hed the church; and, by every wi&s;e method his prudence devi&s;ed, he endeavoured to gain the love and confidence of his people.</P>
<P>He covered his de&s;igns with &s;uch di&s;creet policy, that they were not di&s;covered even in the progre&s;s of their execution. He &s;truck his fir&s;t blow again&s;t the Bri|tons of Cornwall, and added their country to his crown. He &s;ubdued one of the dominions of Wales, that country being then &s;evered into three principali|ties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Higden (p. 252.) &s;ays he al&s;o took Che&s;ter from them.</NOTE>. Soon after the&s;e tran&s;actions were ended, the king of Mercia died. The heptarchy &s;tood at that time reduced to five kingdoms, of which Egbert reigned over the mo&s;t powerful; in the remaining four, confu&s;ion and anarchy prevailed; the ancient race of monarchs were become extinct, and the contending nobles &s;truggling for royalty.</P>
<P>When Egbert was on the eve of carrying his de&s;igns into more public execu|tion, the new king of Mercia, jealous of his preparations for war, marched with a large army towards Sali&s;bury, where a battle was fought with great &s;laughter on both &s;ides; but the victory was Egbert's, and the Mercians, by &s;o &s;evere an over|throw, were not able, for a con&s;iderable time afterwards, to make a &s;tand again&s;t the conqueror, or oppo&s;e his future mea&s;ures. Egbert was &s;en&s;ible of the great advantages he &s;hould derive from being ma&s;ter of the river Thames; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to make his progre&s;s again&s;t Kent, which he &s;oon &s;ubdued, Baldred, the king, flying into Mercia. In a little time afterwards, he made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of E&s;&s;ex; and, in the next place, was &s;ucce&s;sful in fomenting a quar|rel between the Ea&s;t-Angles and Mercians, upon which a revolt took place, the Ea&s;t-Angles di&s;owned their &s;ubjection, and the armies of the two &s;tates came to an engagement, in which Bernulph, the Mercian king, was &s;lain, and his forces routed. The powerful &s;tate of Mercia thus divided and weakened, gave a pro|per opportunity to Egbert to declare him&s;elf an adver&s;ary; and, after &s;e|veral &s;ucce&s;sful battles, he overcame and reduced it to a tributary &s;tate. After this event the Ea&s;t-Angles voluntarily &s;ubmitted them&s;elves on the &s;ame terms with the Mercians, and Northumberland alone remained unreduced<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;.&mdash;Ingulph.&mdash;Sax.

<P>This northern province was not able to with&s;tand &s;o powerful an adver&s;ary. As &s;oon as Egbert pa&s;&s;ed the Humber, and advanced with his army to Dore in York&s;hire, the Northumbrians &s;ubmitted to him, and their &s;overeign became his dependent and tributary<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chron.

<P>This great revolution in Northumberland took place in the year 827 or 828<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;.</NOTE>, about the twentieth year of the reign of Eanred, and the &s;eventh of Heathured's prelacy.

<P>From this period the chronology of the kings of Northumberland is rather confu&s;ed and uncertain: And, by rea&s;on of Egbert's &s;overeignty over all the &s;tates of the heptarchy, and the province of Northumberland having become de|pendent, the connection in the hi&s;tory of the church of Lindisfarne and the &s;tate, is thenceforth much di&s;united.</P>
<P>Heathured<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 89.</NOTE>, after pre&s;iding over the church of Lindisfarne for nine years, departed this life, and was &s;ucceeded by Egred, as &s;ome authors write his name, or rather EGFRID, a per&s;on of noble birth, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an enlarged mind, and &s;trenuous in good works. He brought with him great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the church. From his private fortune he built, and gave to the See for ever, the church of Norham, which he dedicated to St Peter, St Cuthbert, and St Ceolwlf; and thither he cau&s;ed the royal remains to be tran&s;lated, which, from Ceolwlf's death, had re&s;ted in Lindi&s;|farne. He gave Jedword to the church, and al&s;o the church and village which he had built at Gainford; together with the re&s;t of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions between Tyne and Tees. He al&s;o gave thereto his e&s;tates at Clyff and<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Wyclif unde Wigclif haereticus originem duxit.&mdash;Leland.</NOTE> Wycliff, on the &s;outhern banks of Tees, and Billingham in Heortne&s;s.</P>
<P>During this prelate's epi&s;copacy, Eanred, the tributary king of Northumber|land, died; and Ethelred, his &s;on, &s;ucceeded him<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About this time happened a mo&s;t memorable revolution in the neighbouring &s;tates of the Scots and Picts, the former of whom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the we&s;tern parts of the country now called Scotland, and the Picts the ea&s;tern. Through the inti|mate connection which had taken place for ages between the&s;e people, &s;everal intermarriages had happened with tho&s;e of royal blood; and from thence aro&s;e a deadly feud between the two nations. Dungal, king of the Scots, by rea&s;on of an affinity derived from thence, laid claim to the Picti&s;h crown, as heir of their decea&s;ed &s;overeign. The Picts refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to his preten&s;ions, regarding &s;uch an union as derogatory to their honour, and tending to deprive them of privi|lege
<PB N="50" REF="95">which their ance&s;tors purcha&s;ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed by their valour, and elected a new &s;overeign of the royal race. A war en&s;ued, in which Dungal lo&s;t his life, &s;ome a&s;&s;ert by treachery, he falling into the hands of the Picts, who butchered him with inhuman cruelty. In the &s;equel, the Picti&s;h king was &s;lain, and his dominions conquered, by Kenneth, Dungal's &s;on, who united the two &s;tates, and was the fir&s;t monarch of all Scotland. It appears the Northumbrian Saxons gave refuge to the flying Picts, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in many &s;truggles to regain their country, which terminated only in the increa&s;e of Kenneth's power, and exten&s;ion of his empire; for, in retaliation of the injuries he received from the Saxons, he car|ried his arms again&s;t their mo&s;t northern territories, and deprived them of every po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which lay on the north of Tweed. From this period it appears the Tweed became the boundary between England and Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For$un&mdash;Higden&mdash;Holling$$.</NOTE>.

E&s;&s;ay, App. p. $83.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The mi&s;erable di&s;&s;olution of the Picti&s;h &s;tate is &s;carce to be paralleled in hi&s;|tory: Almo&s;t every memorial of its exi&s;tence was de&s;troyed, and the very lan|guage of the people lo&s;t for ever; Kenneth's rage and in&s;atiable revenge for the death of his father being &s;uch, that nothing le&s;s than the extirpation of the whole race could appea&s;e him<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;h.</NOTE>: He &s;pared neither age or &s;ex, and razed their cities to their foundations, pa&s;&s;ing the plough&s;hare over them, that every memorial of that people might be clean done out.</P>
<P>No hi&s;torian hath given us information how far the war carried on by the Nor|thumbrians, in aid of the Picts, was pro&s;ecuted with the approbation or know|ledge of Egbert, though &s;o great a diminution of the Northumbrian territory was the con&s;equence. We may form two contrary, yet probable, conjectures; either that Egbert acquie&s;ced therein, as being jealous of Dungal and Kenneth's too great power, by the union of the kingdoms; or that the de&s;cents of the Danes, which harra&s;&s;ed him &s;o much in the years 833 and 835, rendered the northern operations of little importance, during that emergency.</P>
<P>Some authors<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ridpath, &amp;c.</NOTE> conceive at this period Berwick was fir&s;t fortified and made a &s;tronghold and barrier again&s;t the Saxons, and an oppo&s;ite defence to B$bbanburg, which &s;till remained the chief fortre&s;s of the Northumbrian kingdom.</P>
<P>By our be&s;t hi&s;torians it is &s;aid, the de&s;cents of the Danes, which harra&s;&s;ed Eg|bert &s;o greatly, were all made on the &s;outhern parts of Britain; &s;o that the kingdom of Northumberland does not appear to have been much affected, or the church of Lindisfarne at all di&s;turbed: But, on the authority of the Scala Chro|nica, it appears, <Q>In the 33 yere of E$bright the Danis arrived at Lindisfarne, &startq;and &s;aught with the Engles at Carham, where ii by&s;hhopes and a Engli&s;h coun|ties were &s;layne, and greate numbre of people. Then reignid Ethelred; and &endq;about this time the Danis did much hurte in Northumbreland.</Q> And, from
<PB N="51" REF="96">Fordun, Ridpath &s;ays, <Q>In the year that Kenneth, pa&s;&s;ing the mountains of &startq;Drumalbin, de&s;troyed the monarchy of the Picts, the&s;e latter people are &s;aid to have been weakened by a great overthrow they had received from the Dani&s;h &endq;pirates; which overthrow paved the way to Kenneth's conque&s;t.</Q> From thence it appears, that the Danes had made a de&s;cent on the Lothians, and marched up as far as Carham on the Tweed: But, had they come nearer Lindisfarne, Symeon and other authors, who&s;e accuracy touching the events of that See may be be&s;t re|lied on, would not have been &s;ilent: And the words of the Scala Chronica may be con&s;trued to imply, that the Danes, on this incur&s;ion, di&s;turbed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Lindisfarne; for, at that time, they extended north of Tweed.</P>
<P>Egbert, after a glorious reign, died in the year 838, and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on ETHELWULPH, as &s;overeign of the &s;even united &s;tates, to whom Ethelred, &s;till reigning over Northumberland, did homage, as a depending prince, for his crown.</P>
<P>Our prelate, after pre&s;iding over this See for &s;ixteen years, departed this life A. D. 845<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra.</NOTE>, and was &s;ucceeded by EANBERT, who&s;e epi&s;copacy continued eight years.</P>
<P>Northumberland was in great commotion at the time this prelate was called to the See; for Ethelred, &s;ome few years after a&s;cending the throne, was obliged to fly the country, threatened by one of the chief factions, which by turns had di&s;|tracted that province, and now, become mo&s;t powerful, had given the crown to Redwold their leader. The new king did not long enjoy his dignities; he fell in the field of battle, fighting with the ravaging Danes, who were con&s;tantly re|peating their de&s;cents upon this i&s;land. On Redwold's death, Ethelred was re|called, and re&s;tored; but his renewed power was &s;oon concluded; he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated by the parties of a prevailing faction, who placed a lord called O&s;bert on the throne.</P>
<P>Ethelwulph king of England, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the ince&s;&s;ant toils of warfare, which the repeated vi&s;its from the northern rovers occa&s;ioned, re&s;igned, to his na|tural &s;on Athel&s;tan, the di&s;tricts of E&s;&s;ex, Suffex, and Kent, under the title of king of Kent, re&s;erving to him&s;elf the &s;upreme &s;overeignty. But this divi&s;ion did not &s;ub&s;i&s;t long, the principalities being again united by the death of Athel&s;tan.</P>
<P>It is not &s;aid how O&s;bert's u&s;urpation was received by Ethelwulph, or whether he acknowledged him as his dependent. Soon after he a&s;&s;umed the diadem, our prelate departed this life, in the year 854; and was &s;ucceeded by<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eanbertus, aliis Egbertus &amp; Eadbertus, Ecgredo &s;ubrogalus, &s;edi Lindisfarnen&s;i annis 8 prae&s;ui$. anno 854 $ vita &s;ublatus.

The old king did not &s;urvive this tran&s;action above two years, he departing this life in the year of our Lord 857, having reigned twenty years. Ethelbert, his &s;econd &s;on, &s;uc|ceeded him in the kingdom of Kent, bequeathed to him by his dying father<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;.&mdash;Mat.

This fact doth not appear &s;o enormous, when we are told, by rea&s;on of her tender years, her former marriage was not con&s;ummated, &s;he being left under the care of her father in France. He died in the year 860, and was &s;ucceeded by Ethelbert, in whom the crowns of Kent and We&s;&s;ex were again united. He reigned but &s;ix years, and died in 866, and was &s;ucceeded by his brother Ethelred, the third &s;on of Ethelwulph.</P>
<P>No material event appears to have taken place in the See of Lindisfarne du|ring this period. But Ethelred had not long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his throne before the Danes, with increa&s;ed multitudes, appeared upon the northern coa&s;ts. O&s;bert was in the 17th year of his reign, when the ravagers landed in Northumberland. It is evident their chief objects was plunder and rapine; but authors have been ingenious in devi&s;ing other inducements for their inva&s;ion. By &s;ome a &s;tory is invented, and adopted by Rapin, that king O&s;bert, returning from hunting to his royal re&s;idence then at York, came to the ca&s;tle of Bruern Brocard, a Nor|thumbrian nobleman, in his ab&s;ence, and being de&s;irous of &s;ome refre&s;hment, was mo&s;t courteou&s;ly received and entertained by his lady, of whom he became enamoured; and, in defiance of all the principles of humanity, ho&s;pitality, and ju&s;tice, con&s;trained her to receive his embraces. Bruern on his return being in|formed of the irreparable injury and di&s;grace he had received, went to court, at|tended by his kindred and dependents, and &s;olemnly renounced his allegiance, and the lands he held of the king. Rapin's words are: <Q>He had great intere&s;t &startq;with the Northumbrians, and this ba&s;e action of O&s;bert's was naturally apt
<PB N="53" REF="98">&endq;to alienate the minds of his &s;ubjects from him.</Q> Accordingly, by the manage|ment of the earl, the Bernicians in a little time revolted; and, looking upon O&s;bert as unworthy to govern them, elected another king, who&s;e name was Aella, whom they placed on the throne, with a re&s;olution to &s;upport him as &s;overeign of Bernicia. Thus the old divi&s;ions, which &s;eemed to be quite extingui&s;hed, were kindled afre&s;h, and Northumberland once more was divided between two kings and two factions, who, continually aiming at each other's de&s;truction, were too &s;ucce&s;sful in their endeavours. A civil war was the fatal con&s;equence of this di&s;|cord: The two kings frequently &s;trove to decide their quarrel by arms; but the equality of their forces preventing the &s;cale from preponderating on either &s;ide, each maintained him&s;elf on his re&s;pective throne. The injured earl was yet di&s;&s;a|tisfied with O&s;bert's-lo&s;ing only half of his dominions; his revenge was incom|plete whil&s;t his enemy reigned in Deira: But &s;eeing it difficult to &s;upport his op|po&s;ition longer without a foreign aid, he fatally re&s;olved to &s;ue for &s;uccours from the Danes. Taking his pa&s;&s;age without delay, he fell at the feet of the king of Denmark, to whom, it is &s;aid, he was allied, relating his injuries in pathetic terms, and uttering his grief with a prevalent energy; at the &s;ame time he de|&s;cribed how ea&s;y it was for the Danes to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the whole province of Northumberland, then di&s;tracted by factions; and repre&s;ented the country as lying in a temperate clime, and of a fertile &s;oil. The Dani&s;h monarch, moved, perhaps, as much by the hope of conque&s;t, as the de&s;ire of doing his kin&s;man ju&s;tice, fitted out a powerful fleet and army, under the command of two approved leaders, Inguar and Hubba, &s;aid to be brothers. Matthew of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;ays, The principal view of this Dani&s;h expedition was again&s;t the dominions of Edmund, king of the Ea&s;t-Angles, who was fal&s;ely charged with putting to death the father of the Dani&s;h chieftains, who had been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by an exiled traitor. Collier adopts the &s;tory in the following words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. Hi&s;t. l. iii. p. 160.</NOTE>: <Q>Lode|broch, &startq;a petty prince in Denmark, going a hawking in a boat, and de&s;igning to put in to &s;ome little i&s;land near the &s;hore, where he expected game, was &s;ur|pri&s;ed by a &s;udden &s;torm, driven out to &s;ea, and ca&s;t upon the Engli&s;h &s;hore, near Yarmouth in Norfolk. Upon his arrival, he was &s;eized, and brought to Edmund's court, who was then king of the Ea&s;t-Angles. The king was &s;ur|pri&s;ed with the oddne&s;s of his dre&s;s, and the &s;trangene&s;s of his e&s;cape; and find|ing him an excellent &s;port&s;man; was much plea&s;ed with his company. Bern, king Edmund's chief falconer, perceving him&s;elf out-done in his own bu&s;ine&s;s by this &s;tranger, re&s;olved to get rid of him. To this purpo&s;e he drew him in|to a wood, under pretence of &s;hewing &s;port, and barbarou&s;ly murdered him. Upon this he goes back to court, and &s;eems to wonder what is become of the Dane. Some few days after, Lodebroch's dog, being almo&s;t &s;tarved, comes to the palace, and, being fed, goes away again. The dog doing this &s;everal times, made the king's &s;ervants follow him; and thus they were brought to a &s;ight of the corp&s;e. In &s;hort, Bern was tried for the murder, and being found guilty, was condemned to be put in Lodebroch's boat, and, without either

This miraculous event was attributed to the mediation of St Cuthbert, who&s;e place of re&s;idence the enemy had &s;acked, the old mona&s;tery of Lindisfarne not yet having experienced its late&s;t evils. The Scotti&s;h writers above mentioned &s;eem totally at a lo&s;s to account for the conclu&s;ion of Gregory's expedition, or are a&s;hamed to relate the overthrow he met with, which, under the &s;uper&s;titious pens of mona&s;tic writers, is related in the figurative &s;tile before adopted; from whence nothing more can be inferred, than that the enemy were vanqui&s;hed and di&s;per&s;ed. But Holling&s;hed &s;ays, Alfred made a truce with Gregory, and entered into an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive again&s;t foreign enemies, and that thereupon Northumberland was ceded to the Scots.

Some time after, &s;he took occa&s;ion to relate her dream to an old woman that had been K. Edward's nur&s;e. This woman, who pretended to in|terpret dreams, imagining there was &s;omething extraordinary in this, took Egwina into her hou&s;e, and edu|cated her, not as a country wench, but a per&s;on of quality. Egwina an&s;wered all the old nur&s;e's care and pains about her, and in time became an accompli&s;hed beauty.

As he was admitted to all their councils, and attended them in all their warlike operations and expeditions, he is &s;aid to have acquired, under tho&s;e great examples, a mo&s;t admirable knowledge in mili|tary and political affairs, and was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed prince that had a&s;cended the throne.</P>
<P>Edwin, the decea&s;ed king's elde&s;t legitimate &s;on, was very young: Yet &s;ome di&s;&s;atisfied nobles, who objected to Athel&s;tan's birth, with Alfred, a powerful lord at their head, entered into a con&s;piracy to take off the king by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and place the crown on the head of Edwin. But this project being di&s;covered, Alfred fled to Rome, where he died. The Northumbrian Danes &s;eized the hour of confu&s;ion for ri&s;ing in arms, hoping the confederacy would afford them &s;uf|ficient occa&s;ion for ravage and plunder. It does not appear that their object was independence, or their pretext redre&s;s of grievances; neither had they any fa|vourite chieftain, i&s;&s;ue of their own kings, to &s;erve.

<P>During the&s;e trouble&s;ome events, our prelate departed this life, and was &s;uc|ceeded by WIGRED in the year 928, and at a time of ince&s;&s;ant commotions in the province of Nor|thumberland. Anlaf, Sithric's elde&s;t &s;on, had taken refuge in Ireland, and God|red in Scotland, where they were equally making intere&s;t to be re&s;tored to the throne of their father, and to di&s;turb Athel&s;tan in his government. The &s;ove|reign, offended at the protection the fugitive obtained in the court of Con&s;tantine, the Scotti&s;h monarch, contrary to the principles of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion his crown had re|ceived from that &s;tate, levied a great army, and marched again&s;t Scotland. Rid|path<NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">p. 47.</NOTE> &s;ays, he invaded that kingdom, wherein, according to the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians,
<PB N="66" REF="111">his arms prevailed over all oppo&s;ition, and the king was obliged to &s;ubmit to the victor, as his &s;overeign lord. But Rapin writes, that it was not known what was become of Regnald, and Anlaf was fled into Ireland; &s;o that Athel&s;tan was obli|ged to be &s;atisfied with requiring Con&s;tantine king of Scotland to deliver up God|red. Con&s;tantine, &s;en&s;ible he was not in a condition to deny any thing to a prince at the head of &s;o powerful an army, promi&s;ed to deliver the fugitive into his hands, and give him a meeting at Dacor. But in the mean time Godred ef|fected an e&s;cape; and Con&s;tantine, with Eugenius king of Cumberland, came to the appointed convention; where the Scotti&s;h king acquitting him&s;elf of all cul|pability relative to the prince's e&s;cape, Athel&s;tan di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the two &s;overeigns on their doing homage. Whil&s;t Athel&s;tan was thus employed, Godred arrived at York, &s;ome of his friends holding the ca&s;tle there, which had not been &s;urren|dered to the &s;overeign; but, on Athel&s;tan's a&s;&s;aulting it, according to Malm&s;bu|ry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;. p. 50.</NOTE>, it was &s;urrendered, and he de&s;troyed it to the very foundation.

<P>Anlaf was more &s;ucce&s;sful; for having e&s;tabli&s;hed an intere&s;t in Ireland, he pa&s;|&s;ed over into Scotland, where, by artful in&s;inuations, he won on Con&s;tantine's mind, in&s;piring fears that Athel&s;tan's too great power would induce him to re|duce the crown of Scotland, and bring the whole i&s;land under his dominion: That the mo&s;t politic mea&s;ure to regain the independence of his kingdom, and &s;ecure it from conque&s;t, was to &s;upport the Dani&s;h intere&s;t in Northumberland, which would always be a &s;trong barrier again&s;t the Engli&s;h monarchs, and they a people &s;o inferior in &s;trength, as never to di&s;turb his powerful &s;tate. To tho&s;e arguments he added a&s;&s;urances, that he would join the attempt with a powerful armament from Ireland; and predicted &s;ucce&s;s from the mea&s;ures which they con|certed. It was determined among other things, that the Welch &s;hould take up arms to divert Athel&s;tan's attention, whil&s;t they prepared to make a grand de&s;cent on the banks of the Humber.</P>
<P>The plan being formed, Anlaf returned to Ireland, and the Welch appeared in the field; but the Iri&s;h levies not coming in time, they were cru&s;hed in the fir&s;t battle by Athel&s;tan's &s;uperior arms. He then moved towards Scotland, to cha&s;ti&s;e that kingdom for the part the Scots had taken in this in&s;urrection; and Anlaf &s;till not arriving, Con&s;tantine &s;ued for peace; which was granted by the &s;overeign, who remained ignorant of the great de&s;ign formed again&s;t his govern|ment.</P>

<P>Athel&s;tan departed this life, after a glorious and &s;ucce&s;sful reign, though full of warfare, in the year 940, or 941, in the 46th year of his age, and 16th of his reign, having added &s;everal whole&s;ome laws to tho&s;e of his predece&s;&s;ors. Notwith&s;tanding his confirmation of the privileges of the church of St Cuthbert, from the general tenor of his laws, it is di&s;cernible, he held a &s;trong di&s;like to ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical immunities and &s;pecial juri&s;dictions, which he apprehended were preju|dicial to the &s;tate at large, and to the civil polity of the people.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by Edmund, elde&s;t legitimate &s;on of Edward, &s;tiled the Elder; who with general approbation a&s;cended the throne of England, whil&s;t the whole empire was in a &s;tate of profound peace.</P>
<P>The young king, who had ju&s;t attained the age of eighteen, was not long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a peaceful dominion. The Danes, &s;till turbulent, recalled Anlaf from his place of retreat, who, fully con&s;cious by experience that nothing could be done without a foreign aid, applied to Olaus king of Norway, to whom he en|gaged to pay a large &s;um of money if he was &s;ucce&s;sful; on which terms a pow|erful force was granted, with which he approached the city of York, who&s;e gates were thrown open to him; and this example prevailed with all the le&s;&s;er places of &s;trength within the province of Northumberland. Not content with this po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, and flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, he marched into Mercia, where he won a con&s;ider|able territory. Edmund, with all the ardour of youth, levied his forces, and approached to give Anlaf battle. The two armies met near Che&s;ter in the we&s;t, and the engagement, which was fought with great prowe&s;s on both &s;ides, conti|nued till night obliged the combatants to de&s;i&s;t from the dreadful havoc of the &s;word, which hitherto had not been able to give advantage to either party. Both &s;ides re&s;ted on their arms, prepared to renew the fight at the dawn of day. The archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York, then attending the contending poten|tates, during this interval laboured to bring about a peace, in which al&s;o the nobles on both &s;ides were extremely &s;olicitous. In con&s;equence of this formidable coalition, Edmund was obliged to re&s;ign to Anlaf all the tract of country north of Wa$ling-&s;treet, running from North-Wales to the &s;ea on the &s;outhern parts of Kent: By which treaty and ce&s;&s;ion the kingdom of Northumberland comprehended a boundary more exten&s;ive than it had known in any age, containing &s;everal coun|tries never, previous to that time, within the juri&s;diction of that province.</P>

<P>About this period our prelate, who does not &s;eem to have taken any part in the political &s;y&s;tem, departed this life in the third year of Edmund's reign, having filled the See about &s;eventeen years; in which time, as before ob&s;erved, the riches and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the church were much increa&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wharton&mdash;Symeon, p. 132.&mdash;Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 375.</NOTE>. He was &s;ucceeded by UHTRED, of whom Symeon makes no further mention, than merely to in&s;ert his name: And the other mona&s;tic writers are totally &s;ilent. He filled the See little more than three years, during which &s;hort period the province of Northumberland was in great commotion.</P>
<P>Anlaf was no &s;ooner &s;ettled on his throne, than he began to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures for &s;atisfying the obligations he entered into with the king of Norway; on which account he oppre&s;&s;ed his &s;ubjects with &s;ome heavy taxes. The affections of his people were not with him. The inhabitants of Deira, oppre&s;&s;ed by his impo&s;itions, quickly revolted, and drawing Godred's &s;on from his place of retreat, elected him king of that province. The con&s;equence of &s;uch mea&s;ures was an immediate preparation for war by both parties. Edmund, ob&s;erving the contention, march|ed an army to the borders, and there, as arbiter of the di&s;pute, made peace be|tween the di&s;&s;atisfied parties, on condition that Regnald po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the crown of Deira, to which he was elected, and they both became his tributaries. This deci|&s;ion only laid the foundation of new projects; each party was di&s;&s;atisfied that Ed|mund &s;hould exerci&s;e a &s;overeignty over him; and, as being a foe to them both, they immediately forgot their own quarrel, and entered into a confederacy to &s;hake off obedience. The &s;overeign having early intelligence of their compact, with forced marches, in a little time, gained the frontiers with a powerful army, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of &s;everal places of &s;trength on the border, before the con|federate kings had collected their forces. Edmund's determined mind gave them little hopes of reconciliation; and the only pro&s;pect which remained, was to e&s;cape his &s;ury, and depart the land. This event induced the Danes, who were gather|ing together from all quarters, to throw down their arms, and &s;wear allegiance. In this expedition Edmund &s;eized the kingdom of Cumberland, and gave it to Malcolm, king of the Scots, to hold, as a fief of his crown, by homage; there|by engaging that monarch in a firm alliance. There is no account what per&s;on &s;ucceeded to the Northumbrian &s;ceptre, either under the au&s;pices of Edmund, or by the election of the people; neither is any king of that province &s;poken of un|til the &s;ucceeding reign<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wharton A$g.

<P>Our prelate departed this life in the year 947, and was &s;ucceeded by SEXHELM, a per&s;on of depraved mind, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the See for a few months only. Sy|meon &s;ays, he was &s;o far from being like his predece&s;&s;ors, that he gave him&s;elf up
<PB N="70" REF="115">to the love of riches; to attain which he oppre&s;&s;ed not only the people who inha|bited the territories belonging to the church, but al&s;o the very mini&s;ters officiating in &s;acred duties. He adds, that the bi&s;hop was admoni&s;hed by dreams again&s;t practices &s;o derogatory to the honour of his holy function; and tho&s;e vi&s;ions were &s;o powerfully repeated, and attended with &s;uch afflictions of body, that at length he retired from the See in the greate&s;t horror of mind, and was not re&s;tored to &s;anity, till he had gone beyond the utmo&s;t limits of St Cuthbert's liberties, and arrived near York, where his di&s;ea&s;es for&s;ook him in a miraculous manner.

<P>Aldred had but a &s;hort time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his church when Edmund came to his tragical end, in the 25th year of his age, and 8th of his reign<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">One day as he was &s;olemnizing a fe&s;tival at Pucklekirk in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, he e&s;pied Leolf, a notorious robber, who, though bani&s;hed the kingdom for his crimes, had the impudence to come and &s;it at one of the tables in the hall where the king was at dinner. Enraged at his in&s;olence, he commanded him to be apprehended; but perceiving he was drawing a dagger to defend him&s;elf, the king leapt up in great fury, and catching hold of him by the hair, dragged him out of the hall. This imprudent action co&s;t him his dagger, &s;o that he immediately expired upon the body of his murderer.

<P>This prince, during the &s;hort time he ruled, and in the few rece&s;&s;es he en|joyed from military exploits, made &s;everal excellent laws. He had ob&s;erved that fines, and pecuniary mulcts, did not deter evil men from crimes of the highe&s;t na|ture, and be&s;ides, many who committed them were in a &s;tate of poverty, or had little to lo&s;e; therefore he ordained, that in gangs of robbers apprehended, the olde&s;t of them &s;hould be condemned to die on the gallows: Which was the fir&s;t law in England to puni&s;h that offence with death.</P>
<P>On the demi&s;e of Edmund, A. D. 948, he leaving two infant &s;ons, Edwy and Edgar, his brother Edred, with the unanimous con&s;ent of clergy and nobility, was elected and crowned king of England at King&s;ton, by Odo, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>His reign commenced in conflicts with the Northumbrian Danes, who, on the death of Edmund, thought it a fit opportunity to ri&s;e in arms, and renew their infamous rapine on the adjoining territories. Their weakne&s;s in numbers would
<PB N="71" REF="116">not allow them to entertain any &s;uperior views to tho&s;e of plunder. It appears they had influence &s;ufficient with K. Malcolm of Scotland to induce him to join them; who pre&s;umed the death of Edmund di&s;&s;olved his obligations; and that nation &s;hewing a re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, &s;imilar to their Dani&s;h neighbours, perhaps with &s;imilar views, engaged in the enterpri&s;e.

This &s;udden attack obliged them to &s;ue for mercy.

<P>Having re-e&s;tabli&s;hed peace in Northumberland, he marched his army into Scotland, to cha&s;ti&s;e Malcolm for his breach of truce, and obliged him to renew his homage.</P>
<P>Edred was &s;carce &s;eated in his capital before the perfidious Danes recalled An|laf, and proclaimed him their king. He having gained experience by adver&s;ity, u&s;ed the utmo&s;t expedition to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the places of &s;trength in the province, which he effected before Edred could a&s;&s;emble his army. His wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ition of his forces, and the formidable appearance his armament made, per&s;uaded the &s;o|vereign that it would co&s;t him much blood and trea&s;ure to effect his depo&s;ition; therefore, with a di&s;tingui&s;hed prudence, he delayed attacking tho&s;e territories till &s;ome favourable cri&s;is &s;hould offer it&s;elf; thereby giving lei&s;ure to Anlaf, who thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of the crown, to yield to the natural bent of his temper, which was turbulent and tyrannical. His &s;ubjects, who&s;e natural ferocity and im|patience of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion have been marked in the progre&s;s of their hi&s;tory, could not brook the countenance of &s;everity, which their impetuous humour pretended to di&s;cover in his military di&s;cipline and &s;trict rules of government. In a little time &s;o formidable a party was rai&s;ed again&s;t him, that, to avoid an ignominious death, he was obliged to ab&s;cond, and fly into Ireland; and Yrick, the &s;on of Harold, A.

<P>There was a coalition of parties in this new election, which promi&s;ed &s;ome &s;ta|bility; but at length Anlaf's friends headed a renewed faction in his favour. En|raged at the repeated perfidy of this province, Edred, &s;eeing the divi&s;ion favoured his mea&s;ures, marched northward, threatening to de&s;olate the whole country, and put the inhabitants to the &s;word<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Flor.

At the &s;overeign's appear|ance in the heart of the country, Yrick fled into Scotland, and the inhabitants, in the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, pro&s;trated them&s;elves for mercy, pre&s;ented rich
<PB N="72" REF="117">gifts, and took a mo&s;t &s;olemn oath of allegiance. It appears that Wul&s;tan, arch|bi&s;hop of York, and the Northumbrian nobles, &s;wore fealty to Edred, in a town the ancient writers call Taddens-cliff, now Topcliff.</P>
<P>Edred, not dreading any treachery, returned towards We&s;&s;ex with his army, in detached parties. Florence, alone, &s;ays, the Northumbrians, immediately on Ed|red's retreat, rai&s;ed to the throne one Incus, of Dani&s;h extraction: But nothing further is &s;aid of him. Certain it is they ran to arms, and, by forced marches, pur&s;ued the Engli&s;h army, and fell upon their rear. Al&s;o, by &s;everal ambu&s;cades, they greatly harra&s;&s;ed the detached parties; and had it not been for the valour, conduct, and re&s;olution of the king, his whole army, by this unexpected attack di&s;united and thrown into confu&s;ion, would have been cut to pieces before they could have made a regular &s;tand. At length, by the greate&s;t exertions, the king's army recovered its order, and put the Northumbrians to flight. Enraged at the repeated villainy of the Danes, the king returned towards Northumberland, de|termined to execute his former threats, and lay wa&s;te the whole territory. His march &s;pread horror and di&s;may on every hand: They beheld the avenger advan|cing with fire and &s;word, to take his fill of &s;laughter, and lay the whole country in a&s;hes. Unable to re&s;i&s;t, deprived of every claim to compa&s;&s;ion, branded for breach of &s;acred compacts and oaths, they had no re&s;ource left but ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the king, on &s;uch terms as his ju&s;tice and clemency &s;hould impo&s;e, &s;lavery being now their forlorn hope. The fir&s;t &s;tep was to renounce, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn acts, their allegiance to Yrick, and hang up Amac, the &s;on of An|laf, as a public traitor, to who&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions they attributed their revolt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scala Chron. v. ii. &mdash;Lel.

The king's compa&s;&s;ion and humanity were powerfully a&s;&s;ailed by &s;uch abjectne&s;s of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as the pro&s;trate people di&s;played: The&s;e were mixed with the lamentations of women forlorn, and naked children.

He took the people to his mercy: They &s;urrendered their places of &s;trength, which he filled with garri&s;ons of Engli&s;h. He placed a number of troops in the towns, to check &s;edition, and keep the inhabitants in due &s;ubordination: He dive&s;ted them of all en&s;igns of royalty, and aboli&s;hed regal juri&s;diction. He reduced Northumberland into a province, over which he placed O&s;ulf, governor, dependent entirely on his crown, and gave him the title and dignity of an earl. He relea&s;ed the bi&s;hop, and pardoned him; and extended his clemency to other chie&s;s in the faction, e&s;tabli&s;hing a la&s;ting peace<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>Edred &s;ullied the glories of his reign by yielding too much to the influence of Dun&s;tan, abbot of Gla&s;tonbury, and too great zeal in the affairs of religion. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the crown ten years, and died A. D. 955, leaving two infant &s;ons, nei|ther of whom &s;ucceeded him; Edwy his nephew, &s;on of Edmund, being placed on the throne.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="118">
<P>Although he began his reign at &s;o early an age as fourteen years, he &s;hewed a bold di&s;like to the manners of Dun&s;tan, and the enormous growth of church influ+ence which appeared in the former reign. It is evident his judgment in tho&s;e matters, though ju&s;t, was attended with too much of the ra&s;hne&s;s and impetu|o&s;ity of youth. The clergy had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the con&s;ciences of the people; acts of devotion and piety were become deeply tinctured with &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m: The &s;acredne&s;s of religious hou&s;es and mona&s;tic orders had encrea&s;ed into that re|verence, that, to &s;peak again&s;t them in the ear of the people, was accounted im|pious and prophane. A burning zeal exi&s;ted towards the mini&s;ters and rights of religion. The young king did not &s;ufficiently e&s;timate this influence, and the danger which would attend any attempt to &s;hake it. He knew not what a tre|mendous enemy he was rou&s;ing when he oppo&s;ed this hydra of power. He con|ceived not the &s;ecret channels by which the foe he was braving would conduct the oppo&s;ition; and &s;uch it was that along with it was promulged, to the alarmed con|&s;ciences of men, who received the monks to their clo&s;et, that it was rendering a &s;ervice to God to remove tho&s;e who were obnoxious to his religion and church. It was not long before a faction appeared in Mercia, agitated by the monks, who were deprived of the benefices Dun&s;tan procured them, by removal of the &s;ecu|lar clergy, now re&s;tored. In the popular cry, the king was repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t impious of men; and at the head of the malcontents Edgar his brother ap|peared, under the denomination of <HI>Protector of the Church:</HI> A title replete with a thou&s;and horrors, &s;pecious and delu&s;ive, calculated to &s;educe the zealot and en|thu&s;ia&s;t. Having &s;ecured Mercia, he gained over to his cau&s;e the deba&s;ed race of Danes in Ea&s;t-Anglia and Northumberland, who, not for the cau&s;e of religion, but from a habit of wickedne&s;s, and being ripe for evil deeds, appeared in arms in his favour. Edwy, a&s;toni&s;hed at the rebellion, &s;tood di&s;mayed: He had not infringed the laws, oppre&s;&s;ed the people, or injured his brother. His con&s;cience was void of offence, &s;ave only in his oppo&s;ition to the enormity of the eccle&s;ia&s;|tic power. He did not accu&s;e him&s;elf of giving cau&s;e for the in&s;urrection; nei|ther did he apprehend the religious had &s;ufficient influence to create the tumult which on every hand &s;urrounded him. Not willing to occa&s;ion any effu&s;ion of blood in &s;uch a conte&s;t, he was content in &s;ecuring the faithful kingdom of We&s;|&s;ex to him&s;elf, and &s;urrendered the re&s;t to his brother.</P>
<P>Some of the mona&s;tic writers charge Edwy with abundant wickedne&s;s; others only accu&s;e him of a la&s;civious habit; but the mo&s;t judicious of the moderns &s;ay, his fame and misfortunes were equally derived from the monks.

<P>Edgar now a&s;&s;umed the diadem of England, and was &s;carce advanced to the age of &s;ixteen years when he a&s;cended the throne of the united kingdoms. He was a favourer of the monks, from who&s;e flattery he derived the appellation of <HI>the
<PB N="74" REF="119">Peaceable;</HI> ble&s;t al&s;o with the title of <HI>Protector of the Church.</HI> He recalled Dun|&s;tan from a voluntary exile, to which he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf in Edwy's reign, and gave him the See of Worce&s;ter. Under this bi&s;hop's influence or admini&s;tration, the &s;tate was kept in peace, not by pa&s;&s;ive and weaker mea&s;ures, but the wi&s;dom and vigour di&s;played in the &s;everal departments of government. He held the array in continual exerci&s;e of arms, &s;o as to be ready, on the &s;horte&s;t notice, to bring a very formidable army into the field, thereby keeping up re&s;pect from the neighbouring potentates. In the northern provinces he kept the fortified places and towns filled with well di&s;ciplined troops, by which the Danes were held in awe. He had a powerful navy, &s;aid to exceed 4000 ve&s;&s;els, di&s;tributed in all the ports of the i&s;land, and at intervals crui&s;ing on the coa&s;ts, to the de&s;truction of piracy, and &s;afe-guard of the kingdom, again&s;t de&s;cents of a foreign enemy. The&s;e were &s;ufficient to keep him &s;uperior to all the other princes of the i&s;land, who are &s;aid to have made him a voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. His attention was al&s;o engaged to the promotion of agriculture; and to him the kingdom was indebted for the extirpation of wolves, which were de&s;tructive to the more northern parts in particular, being not only mountainous, but covered with exten&s;ive fore&s;ts. This he chiefly effected, by publi&s;hing an act of grace and remi&s;&s;ion to offenders, on their bringing in a number of wolves tongues, apportioned to their offences. He redre&s;&s;ed the grievances of the people, by puni&s;hing the civil officers who tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law, and relieved them by a di&s;pen&s;ation of impartial ju&s;tice; to which end he frequently vi&s;ited the &s;everal di&s;tricts, and received complaints from all ranks of men, with a di&s;tingui&s;hed humanity.</P>
<P>Dun&s;tan's character as a mini&s;ter of &s;tate was very great; but, as an eccle&s;ia&s;tic; &s;evere and tyrannical. He, with the prince's power totally at his will, again ex|cluded the &s;eculars, and brought the regular clergy into benefices. Collier &s;ays, it is ob&s;ervable in the province of Northumberland in general, and in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of St Cuthbert in particular, no monks were then introduced into religious foundations; nay, they were not admitted there till after the Norman conque&s;t: So that he does not give the fraternity of Lindisfarne or Che&s;ter that denomi|nation.</P>
<P>During Edgar's peaceful reign, our prelate departed this life, in the year 968<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra, p. 701.&mdash;Sym. Dun. p. 138.</NOTE>, and was &s;ucceeded by ELFSIG, who was con&s;ecrated at York by Archbi&s;hop O&s;ketill, and held the See for twenty-two years.</P>
<P>The &s;ame political principles from whence &s;uch prudent regulations, touching other parts of the &s;tate, were derived, produced one equally wi&s;e relative to the province of Northumberland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chr. J. Wal. p. 544.</NOTE>. It appeared that the earldom of this exten|&s;ive territory was an office of too great power to &s;tand con&s;i&s;tent with the due
<PB N="75" REF="120">&s;ubordination of the &s;ubject, by which the &s;prings of government were to ope|rate to the protection of the whole. The king therefore thought proper to divide Northumberland into two earldoms; to effect which purpo&s;e, he called a council of the barons of that province at York; where the matter being deliberated upon, and it being demon&s;trated to the a&s;&s;embly, that the divi&s;ion would conduce to the better protection of the northern territories, it was determined on O&s;ulf's death, which happened about the time of this re&s;olution, that O&s;lac &s;hould be made earl of the country between Humber and Tees; and the government of the di&s;trict north of Tees, to be be&s;towed on Eadulf.</P>
<P>Edgar's political hi&s;tory is full of honour; but his private &s;tory is blotted with impetuous pa&s;&s;ions, impatient to be gratified at the expence of ju&s;tice, religion, and virtue. The monki&s;h writers &s;anctify him with unbounded prai&s;es, in con&s;e|quence of the patronage he held out towards them in every channel. He depart|ed this life in the year 975, in the 32d year of his age, leaving two &s;ons and a daughter. His elde&s;t &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Edward, was born of a doubtful mar|riage; &s;ome &s;ay he was the i&s;&s;ue of a concubine.</P>
<P>The new e&s;tabli&s;hment of two earldoms took place without any re&s;i&s;tance or op|po&s;ition, all &s;uch being totally &s;u&s;pended by the &s;trict civil admini&s;tration, and mi|litary power of Edgar's government.</P>
<P>Soon after the bi&s;hop's coming to this See, Kenneth king of Scotland de&s;ired an interview with his illu&s;trious brother the king of England, of who&s;e greatne&s;s and magnificence he had an anxious wi&s;h to be a &s;pectator. To this purpo&s;e the Engli&s;h monarch commanded the two earls of Northumberland, and Elf&s;ig the bi&s;hop, to conduct Kenneth to his court, where he met with &s;uch cordiality and ho&s;pitable reception, as occa&s;ioned an amicable treaty to take place, in which the Lothians, ancient appendages of the crown of Scotland, were &s;urrendered up, and ever after united to that kingdom.</P>
<P>Edward was only fourteen years of age when he was crowned king of England. On his acce&s;&s;ion great di&s;&s;entions appeared touching the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and a nume|rous party openly declared again&s;t him; but, being &s;upported by the church, with Dun&s;tan at their head, he was &s;eated on the throne. It gave di&s;tre&s;s to many of the nobles to behold the kingdom under the government of that haughty pre|late again, who had multiplied his deeds of ab&s;olute power with his years: But, now holding the regency, and the &s;ame rules of government e&s;tabli&s;hed in Edgar's reign being &s;upported, this was no &s;ea&s;on to &s;truggle again&s;t the encrea&s;ing evils. All the church regulations of this &s;hort reign were in favour of the monks: In civil government we hear of no changes, or improvement of laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>This prince's mi&s;erable death, by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, took place in the fifth year of his reign; the horrid circum&s;tances of which &s;tamp the age with an infamous &s;tigma. From the tears and affection of the church, he was &s;tiled &s;aint and martyr, though his murder had not the lea&s;t relation to any religious opinion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edward pa&s;&s;ing one day, as he was returning from hunting, near Corf Ca&s;tle, where his mother-in-law El&s;rida re&s;ided with her &s;on Ethelred, rode off from his company, in order to pay her a vi&s;it. El&s;rida being told the king was at the gate, r$n to receive him, and urged him very earne&s;tly to alight, and take &s;ome refre&s;hment.

<P>In the year 970, Ethelred, Edgar's &s;on by Elfrida, a&s;cended the throne, and was crowned by bi&s;hop Dun&s;tan when he was about twelve years of age.</P>
<P>It is not important to that locality which gives &s;uch narrow bounds to this work, to pa&s;s through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of circum&s;tances and events which at|tended the fir&s;t years of the young king's reign. It mu&s;t &s;uffice to &s;ay, that church authority began to wane when bi&s;hop Dun&s;tan left the world; and the Danes, by repeated de&s;cents, di&s;tracted the &s;outhern provinces of the kingdom. The king is repre&s;ented as an abject coward<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maim&s;.</NOTE>, &s;upine, and overwhelmed in the &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s of a weak mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by avarice, and totally dive&s;ted of every principle of virtue and honour. Under &s;uch a prince, it is not a&s;toni&s;hing that the reins of government &s;hould be relaxed, military &s;pirit langui&s;h, and anarchy be &s;een making prevalent &s;trides towards univer&s;al confu&s;ion; or that armies &s;hould fly before the enemy; that commanders &s;hould be treacherous; and mini|&s;ters, with the mo&s;t abject ignorance, or the mo&s;t depraved corruption, pu&s;h on mea&s;ures uncon&s;titutional, impolitic, and de&s;tructive. Such were the calamities which marked this unhappy aera. The annals of Edgar were yet recent and in memory, in which not only Peace cultivated her olives, but al&s;o military ardour planted young laurels, which &s;pread them&s;elves over the palaces of princes. The &s;overeigns of Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Man, and the I&s;les, were his dependents, without the coercion of the &s;word. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that the laurel &s;hould be nouri&s;hed by blood: It flouri&s;hes in the regions of virtue; and honour conquers more than the &s;word.</P>
<P>Elf&s;ig<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra, p. 701.&mdash;Sym.

<P>The Danes, having de&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time from their acts of piracy and rapine, made the Engli&s;h conclude other pur&s;uits had engaged their attention. But, alas! this interval of peace was merely delu&s;ive, and filled with vain hopes; for the
<PB N="77" REF="122">year next &s;ucceeding the bi&s;hop's con&s;ecration, with a numerous army, they landed on the &s;outhern coa&s;ts of Britain. The king intimidated, without power to re|&s;i&s;t, or wi&s;dom to avoid the wretchedne&s;s which en&s;ued; without an army, with|out fortitude of mind, and every other aid the exigency required, had recour&s;e to the councils of Syric archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who, with as little fore&s;ight as his &s;overeign, advi&s;ed a large &s;um of money to be given to the invaders, to &s;top their depredations, and quit the land. This project had not only its imme|diate effect, but al&s;o its certain con&s;equence; for, though the pre&s;ent evil was re|lieved, the rich bait induced new armies of nece&s;&s;itous wretches to &s;eek the gold|en &s;hores from whence their countrymen returned enriched. Within two years, another fleet appeared, and landed troops on the north &s;ide of Humber. They made grievous depredations on the province of Northumberland, a&s;&s;ailed and took the ca&s;tle of Bebbanburg, where they found much trea&s;ure; and, after plundering it of every thing valuable, de&s;troyed and defaced as much of the works as they could<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoveden&mdash;Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>. In this de&s;cent, the unhappy con&s;equence of having leaders of foreign extraction or connections was demon&s;trated; for, when a large army of Engli&s;h were drawn up in order of battle, to oppo&s;e the invaders, the command|ers turned their backs, left the field to their countrymen, and the troops to be cut down or di&s;per&s;ed by the enemy. On this occa&s;ion, the former mode of pacifying the invaders was again renewed. We are not told whether the See of Che&s;ter &s;uffered any thing by this inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the year 995, Sweyn king of Denmark, and Olaus king of Norway, allu|red by the accounts of Engli&s;h wealth, and the total relaxation of military &s;pirit, which tho&s;e who had lately vi&s;ited the i&s;land perceived to prevail with the inhabi|tants, were de&s;irous of partaking in the lucrative expeditions their countrymen had experienced; with a powerful fleet they entered the Thames, and from thence, &s;preading them&s;elves into divers parts, gathered much plunder and &s;poil. It &s;eems that a party of the invaders infe&s;ted the northern coa&s;ts at the &s;ame time, which induced bi&s;hop Aldune, with the whole body of religious &s;ettled at Che&s;ter, toge|ther with their va&s;&s;als and dependents, to quit that place, and travel to Ripon, carrying with them the remains of St Cuthbert, the holy relics, and riches of the church; and al&s;o their cattle, goods, and effects.</P>
<P>The See, which had been &s;ettled at Che&s;ter for 113 years, was for ever removed from thence, and that place totally deprived of all the wealth and honour depend|ent thereon. The ince&s;&s;ant troubles which di&s;tracted the province of Northum|berland from the time the See was fir&s;t &s;ettled at Che&s;ter, give little pro&s;pect of any con&s;iderable advancement having taken place in literature, arts, &s;ciences, or manufactures, during that period; nor of the bi&s;hops having been di&s;tingui&s;hed for learning, peculiar acts of piety, or good works. The rights of the church were not invaded, and the &s;ociety of eccle&s;ia&s;tics in the mona&s;tery contented them&s;elves in the exerci&s;e of their religious function, and the tranquil enjoyments of the cloi&s;ter. The laws which were ordained, and had peculiar direction to the vices of this province, do not prove, that, even in the uncultivated ferocity of
<PB N="78" REF="123">many of the inhabitants, they were guilty of more enormous crimes than the people of other parts of England. Architecture had gained few improvements. Alfred fir&s;t reformed the buildings, by &s;ub&s;tituting &s;tone and brick edifices for tho&s;e of wood, wattlings, and mud, which were the only materials in general u&s;e before his time. Yet it does not appear, that even this improvement had ta|ken place in the north; for the church of Che&s;ter was built of wood. Upon the whole, the intercour&s;e with the Danes &s;eems to have introduced nothing but evil; they appear to have been mere &s;avages, barbarous in their manners, fero|cious and uncultivated; and, like a troop of wolves, came upon the di&s;tracted villages, carrying nothing but de&s;olation and horror in their progre&s;s. If they brought no benefits which have &s;urvived to po&s;terity, they have left us one memo|rial of their execrable exi&s;tence, the dregs of a guttural language; than which the tongues of Africa, and the coa&s;ts of Guinea, or of the wild nations of Ame|rica, are not more di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>Ethelred, who had no more conduct than courage, not knowing how to put a &s;top to the ravages the Danes were committing, had recour&s;e to the &s;ame expe|dient made u&s;e of on the like occa&s;ion, and bound him&s;elf by treaty to pay them a large &s;um of money, as it is &s;aid, not le&s;s than 16,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sax.

<P>During the interval of peace, the bi&s;hop, with his whole train of attendants, took up the holy relics, their herds and flocks, and all their effects, and left Ripon, intending to return to Che&s;ter, after an ab&s;ence from that church of about four months. As they approached the ground where Durham now &s;tands, by a mira|culous interpo&s;ition, the monki&s;h writers tell us, the carriage on which the body of St Cuthbert, with the other relics, were born, became immoveable, at a place to the ea&s;tward of the pre&s;ent city, called Wrdelau. From this miraculous re|&s;i&s;tance the eccle&s;ia&s;tics determined Heaven would not permit the Saint to return to his former re&s;ting-place. Yet they remained ignorant of the &s;ituation appoint|ed to receive their holy charge. The ground where they then &s;ojourned, did not &s;eem &s;uitable to the re&s;idence of &s;o numerous a body of attendants, being in the middle of a plain or open field, and a place uninhabitable. Such is the de|&s;cription given of it<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 139, 140, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The bi&s;hop admoni&s;hed his company, that they &s;hould fa&s;t and pray until the will of Heaven was revealed. Accordingly, after much pious ab&s;tinence, &s;elf-denial, and prayer, Eadmer, one of the mo&s;t favoured of the at|tendants, received the revelation, and Dunhelme was pronounced the place de|creed by the Powers above for &s;he holy Saint's re&s;t on earth. Tradition &s;ays, the place, by the revealed name, was wholly unknown to the bi&s;hop and his attend|ants, who wandered about for &s;ome time in &s;earch of it; and that the di&s;covery was accidentally made by a woman's enquiries after her cow, which &s;trayed in Dunholme. The ancients had much &s;uper&s;tition touching the foundation of cities: A &s;ow and pigs was the omen which di&s;tingui&s;hed the ground the deities ordained

<P>A mount towards the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, called Wardenlaw, is pre&s;umed to be the Saint's re&s;ting-place; but being near the coa&s;t, and a very few miles from Were|mouth, could not be called an uninhabitable &s;tation.

<P>Whil&s;t the bi&s;hop and his convent were &s;ettling matters relative to their church at Durham, Ethelred encountered innumerable embarra&s;&s;ments with dome&s;tic, as well as foreign enemies, but particularly from the Dani&s;h inva&s;ions. Ethelred, complaining that Cumberland had not aided him again&s;t tho&s;e invaders, or contri|buted its proportion of money towards the &s;ums granted them, agreeable to treaty, marched a powerful army into that country, where he committed tho&s;e ravages which di&s;grace the age. The mo&s;t uncivilized nations were never more rapacious, inhuman and revengeful; even carrying the natives into &s;lavery, like the horrid trade on the coa&s;ts of Guinea, was a familiar practice: Butchering, maiming, and whatever dreadful names have been given to cruelty, were exerci&s;ed: Sacking, pillaging, burning, and laying de&s;olate a mi&s;erable country, marked the unhappy progre&s;s of &s;uch armies. But Ethelred's expedition was confined to a narrow province, and was &s;oon revenged upon his own territories. The Danes, returning from an expedition again&s;t Normandy, over-ran many of the riche&s;t parts of England, collecting a great booty. The timorous prince, &s;urrounded by di&s;tracted councils, de&s;erted by many of his &s;ubjects, who would not fight again&s;t the invaders, or &s;ecretly abetted them, him&s;elf incon&s;tant of mind, and dive&s;ted of every military habit, had recour&s;e to the former expedient, and granted them a premium of 30,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>, an immen&s;e &s;um in tho&s;e days, for re&s;toring peace to his &s;ubjects, and withdrawing their armies from the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the payment of this money, every hide of land was taxed yearly twelve pence; or, as &s;ome au|thors &s;ay, two &s;hillings<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sir Henry Spellman in his Glo&s;&s;ary, p. 292, makes the number of hides in England amount to 243,600; con&s;e|quently the gro&s;s produce of this tax, at 25. per hide, would, at that rate, amount to 24,360<ABBR>l.</ABBR>; a very great &s;um to be annually rai&s;ed at that period.

Although the chief body of the Danes quitted the country, yet many remained, and &s;ettled here, joining their countrymen in Ea&s;t-Anglia and Northumberland, obtaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in land; and, wherever they were di&s;per|&s;ed, &s;uch was their in&s;olence, and the fear the natives had of their pride and
<PB N="83" REF="128">cruelty, that they obtained the name of <HI>Lord Danes:</HI> A denomination that car|ried dete&s;tation with it to the &s;uffering inhabitants, who&s;e toils were exerted to rai&s;e the Dane-gelt, and perform the &s;ervices tho&s;e ta&s;k-ma&s;ters impo&s;ed on the va&s;&s;als of their lands, without mercy.</P>
<P>Ethelred's queen dying, he married Emma, &s;i&s;ter of Richard, &s;econd duke of Normandy; which alliance giving him hope of &s;uccour and defence again&s;t the fo|reign invaders, he is &s;aid to have projected the cowardly and brutal ma&s;&s;acre of the Danes which &s;hortly en&s;ued<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To execute this project, orders were conveyed &s;o privately throughout the kingdom, that, in one day, all the Danes were &s;lain with &s;uch implacable fury and cruelty, that the particulars cannot be read without horror. Sweyn's &s;i&s;ter, for her beauty called the <HI>Pearl of Normandy,</HI> who was married to an Engli&s;h lord, having at fir&s;t been &s;pared, Ethelred was &s;o barbarous, as to cau&s;e her children to be murdered in her pre&s;ence, and then her head to be cut off. This bloody tragedy was acted on the 13th November 1002. It was greatly &s;imilar to the ma&s;&s;acre of the Romans by the Britons under Boadicea: Not only the like barbari|ties, but the &s;ame con&s;equences, attended both.&mdash;Sax. Ann. Huntingd. Mat. of We&s;t. Rapin, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The unhappy project was attended with &s;o many unpropitious circum&s;tances, and brought on &s;o many deplorable con&s;equen|ces, that it a&s;toni&s;hes the mind, touched with tender feelings, how it could ever enter into the devices of a Chri&s;tian heart. But cruelty and cowardice are in&s;e|parable. Sweyn king of Denmark received intelligence of this bloody cata&s;trophe by &s;ome emi&s;&s;ary from England; for the murderous &s;word could not po&s;&s;ibly be extended over Northumberland, where the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants were Danes. In abhorrence of &s;o barbarous an act, and in revenge of the death of his &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e fate was peculiarly &s;evere, he projected an expedition again&s;t England, the old motive of plunder and pillage being only &s;econdary in this tran|&s;action, which originated in a vow of vengeance, and to correct a prince and people who&s;e hands were embrued in innocent blood. With 300 &s;ail of &s;hips he approached the &s;hores of Cornwall, and landed his troops there. He marched his army to Exeter, reduced the town to a&s;hes, and put the inhabitants to the &s;word, as an example he propo&s;ed to follow in his progre&s;s. He pillaged and de&s;troyed a large tract of country, without oppo&s;ition. At length the king's ar|my, under the command of Alfric duke of Mercia, oppo&s;ed him; and the battle array was formed, when the Engli&s;h leader, in re&s;entment of injuries he had formerly &s;uffered from the king, betrayed his tru&s;t, de&s;erted his troops, &s;uffered the army to be routed and di&s;per&s;ed for want of a commander, and gave up the country to be wa&s;ted and depopulated by the enemy. Sweyn employed the re&s;t of the &s;ummer in pur&s;uing his warfare; but, before the winter &s;torms &s;et in, with|drew his troops, and departed for Denmark. He returned in &s;pring, landed his army in Ea&s;t-Anglia, and began his operations by de&s;troying Norwich. He was oppo&s;ed by a body of Engli&s;h, and, with great lo&s;s and difficulty, claimed the victory. Providence was again&s;t the king; he mi&s;carried in every attempt. His folly was not greater than his cruelty, which, through private acts of &s;everity, weaned many of his nobles from their allegiance. His councils were di&s;&s;entaneous and di&s;tracted; his courtiers fal&s;e; his commanders and chiefs treacherous and di&s;loyal; and his people abject and di&s;pirited. Amid&s;t all the public calamities, and the diffidence in tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;upport the &s;tate, it is a&s;toni&s;hing that the
<PB N="84" REF="129">avarice of the clergy, and particularly of the monks, very much helped to en|crea&s;e the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the kingdom: For, notwith&s;tanding their great riches, they refu&s;ed to contribute their proportion of money nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the crown, pleading their privileges and immunities, as if they had no &s;hare in the danger. An en&s;uing famine drove the Danes from the land, and gave the mi&s;er|able people a re&s;pite from war, only to peri&s;h by want.</P>
<P>The calamities of the country being relieved by the en&s;uing harve&s;t, the Danes renewed their de&s;cent near Sandwich, and wintered in the I&s;le of Thanet. Ethel|red had no expedient to relieve his country from the plunderers, but by agreeing to pay them the like &s;um of 30,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> The Danes, from the repetition of tho&s;e compo&s;itions, at length claimed an annual tribute from England. It would be a melancholy recapitulation to go through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of calamities which befel this country during Ethelred's reign: It &s;uffices to &s;ay, that &s;uch was the power gained by Sweyn king of Denmark in the year 1013, that Ethelred, be&s;ieged in London, with &s;ome difficulty e&s;caped with a few faithful attendants to Nor|mandy; &s;oon after which Sweyn was proclaimed king of England. From the authority of Godwin it appears, that, in the&s;e times of public calamity, one bi&s;hop had the care of the education of the king's &s;ons, Alfred and Edward, born of Emma, his &s;econd queen; and that he attended them with their mother into Normandy, where he left them under the protection of duke Richard, their uncle. How this act of pious duty was reli&s;hed by the u&s;urper, is not &s;aid; and indeed the fact &s;eems doubtful from the hazard the church was in from &s;uch a daring piece of virtue, which militated &s;o powerfully again&s;t Sweyn's hopes of e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to his own i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Sweyn exerci&s;ed no other remarkable act of authority but the impo&s;ition of a grievous tax upon the country for payment of his troops; for, either by poi&s;on or accidental death, he did not enjoy his conque&s;t the &s;pace of one year, and was never crowned king of the&s;e dominions. On Sweyn's death, the Danes proclaim|ed Canute, his &s;on, king; but the Engli&s;h recalled Ethelred, the &s;hort experience they had of Dani&s;h government being intolerable.</P>
<P>The king, on his re&s;toration, did not di&s;play any examples that the corrections received in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity had gained him wi&s;dom; for his fir&s;t attention was to revenge, upon part of his &s;ubjects, an affront he conceived they had of|fered him; and it was only a &s;econdary con&s;ideration with him, that he had to op|po&s;e his people's enemy. Canute did not think it expedient, at that cri&s;is, to op|po&s;e the king's army; but, by a regular and well-conducted retreat, he brought his troops to the &s;ea-&s;hore, and embarked them for Denmark. The Dani&s;h hi&s;|tory &s;ays, that Canute's younger brother, being left regent, on the death of his father u&s;urped the throne, which obliged Canute to repair immediately to his own country, to recover his inheritance, and the crown of his ance&s;tors: That bu&s;i|ne&s;s being effected, he returned with his victorious army to England, and landed at Sandwich, to a&s;&s;ert his right to his father's conque&s;ts. Strange di&s;&s;entions ap|peared in the king's party; the army would not move, unle&s;s headed by their &s;o|vereign, who, in abject cowardice, feigned &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;hut him&s;elf up in Lon|don.
<PB N="85" REF="130">Though the king's &s;on Edmund, who had much knowledge and per&s;onal courage, u&s;ed every effort to win the troops to the field of honour, on the king's not appearing to command them, they di&s;banded them&s;elves, and returned home.</P>
<P>A &s;econd army was levied; but though the king was induced by his &s;on to ap|pear at their head, he had not courage to lead them again&s;t the enemy, pretend|ing he feared &s;ome treachery devi&s;ed to &s;urrender him into the hands of his foe. At length, he withdrew from the army, and got privately into London. Ed|mund, under the&s;e di&s;couraging circum&s;tances, retired into the north, and joined him&s;elf to Uchtred earl of Northumberland, who married his &s;i&s;ter Edgina: But, after &s;ome weak efforts in the northern di&s;tricts, Uchtred was obliged to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to Canute, and Edmund got &s;ecretly into London. Such a complication of misfortunes, with &s;o weak a mind as Ethelred di&s;played, at length brought him into a langui&s;hing &s;tate of health, and, in the year 1016, he departed this life in London, in the 50th year of his age, and 37th of his reign; leaving his kingdom in the mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate that any country or people ever expe|rienced.</P>
<P>Edmund, his elde&s;t &s;on, who, from his robu&s;t form and manly courage, was &s;urnamed <HI>Iron&s;ide,</HI> was proclaimed king. Under this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, after many &s;e|vere &s;truggles, London being thrice be&s;ieged, and as often repul&s;ed the be&s;iegers; and the young king having experienced the repeated treacheries of Edric Streon, the infamous duke of Mercia, his brother-in-law, a treaty of peace was con|cluded, by which Mercia, Ea&s;t-Anglia, and Northumberland, were con&s;igned to Canute; and Edmund held the re&s;t of England. But this peace had not &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted long before Edmund &s;uffered death by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and the contrivance of the duke of Mercia, he not having accompli&s;hed the fir&s;t year of his reign, leaving two &s;ons of tender years.</P>
<P>On Edmund's demi&s;e, Canute in&s;i&s;ting it was a provi&s;ion of the compact made on the divi&s;ion of the kingdom, that the &s;urvivor &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole, and his power being irre&s;i&s;tible, though his allegation was e&s;teemed a mere contrivance, the nobles thought it expedient to &s;ubmit to his claim: He was therefore pro|claimed, and &s;oon after crowned king of all England.</P>
<P>Having taken a &s;hort view of the &s;tate at large, it is nece&s;&s;ary to look back up|on Northumberland, to remark the changes and events which took place there within the foregoing period. According to Symeon's account, Uchtred was earl of Northumberland when the See was tran&s;lated to Durham, and the new church erected there. Rapin &s;ays, on Uchtred's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Canute, he was conti|nued in his government, though but for a little while, as he plainly &s;aw the earl had changed &s;ides purely by compul&s;ion, and had rea&s;on to fear he would not re|main faithful; &s;o he cau&s;ed him to be put to death, and placed Eric, a Dani&s;h lord, in his room<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 142, 284, 325.</NOTE>. It is ob&s;ervable, this re&s;pectable author &s;hews no authority for this relation.

<P>Northumberland was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by incur&s;ions of the Scots. Ridpath, in his Bor|der Hi&s;tory, has the following relation. Malcolm king of Scotland made an in|cur&s;ion into this province; and, committing great ravages therein, Waltheof their earl, debilitated with age, &s;hut him&s;elf up in the ca&s;tle of Bambrough; whil&s;t Uchtred his &s;on, a youth of great intrepidity, having a&s;&s;embled and armed a numerous body of Northumbrians, attacked and almo&s;t de&s;troyed the Scots army; their king, with a few of his attendants, e&s;caping with difficulty from the field of battle. In reward of this gallant and important &s;ervice, Ethelred con|ferred on Uchtred the earldom of his father, then living, adding to his juri&s;dic|tion the &s;outhern divi&s;ion of Northumberland, again uniting the whole province in one earldom. This incur&s;ion mo&s;t probably took place by way of repri&s;al for Ethelred's de&s;troying Cumberland; as no other cau&s;e appears in hi&s;tory for the Scots to a&s;&s;i&s;t in aggravating the mi&s;eries of this reign. But the calamities pre|pared for the Northumbrians by their northern foes did not cea&s;e there; for after Canute's coronation, Symeon &s;ays, that great di&s;tre&s;s having been predicted by a tremendous comet in the year 1718, the Scots, with a numerous army, entered the borders, and were oppo&s;ed by the Northumbrians at Carrum, their army con|&s;i&s;ting of all the fighting men between Tees and Tweed, with the nobility and chieftains of the greate&s;t eminence and valour; an army as well the mo&s;t nu|merous as be&s;t accoutred and arrayed, that Northumberland, in any period of its hi&s;tory, had carried into the field, compo&s;ed of the &s;lower of tho&s;e who held lands under the See of Durham. The Scots were victorious. The &s;laughter was dreadful, the greate&s;t part of the Northumbrian army being cut to pieces. So greatly was this misfortune felt, that many parts of the country were almo&s;t depopulated by the fatal cata&s;trophe. This battle, though mentioned by &s;everal authors, is placed in contrary and uncertain aeras: Such is the hi&s;torical confu&s;ion of tho&s;e times. Symeon &s;ays, that the good bi&s;hop was &s;o greatly afflicted with the lo&s;s of &s;o many of the chieftains and people of the lands of St Cuthbert, that, through unremitting grief, his health declined, and he departed this life in the year 1018, in the 29th year of his epi&s;copacy, and the 24th after the tran&s;lation of the See to Durham. He was &s;aid to be by birth noble; but nobler for his virtuous and holy life. If there is any foundation for &s;uppo&s;ing he had the tuition of queen Emma's children, he was rather &s;ingular in his purpo&s;e of putting them under the care of their uncle; few prelates, in tho&s;e days of confu&s;ion, appearing to in|termeddle

<P>Whil&s;t the eccle&s;ia&s;tics &s;at in chapter to agitate this important &s;ubject, a prie&s;t called Eadmund<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 378.</NOTE>, de&s;cended of noble progenitors, but of a facetious character, entered the church, and being informed of the nature of their deliberations, and their divi&s;ions, in a je&s;ting manner exclaims, "Why cannot you make me a bi|&s;hop!" The a&s;&s;embly, &s;tartled at the que&s;tion, and knowing him to be a man of &s;trict piety and religious virtue, received this interrogation in a more &s;erious &s;en&s;e than he ever intended; for they conceived his coming there, and uttering the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, was by divine impul&s;e. As many momentous concerns in that age were influenced by &s;uper&s;tition, they determined, that thus the will of Hea|ven had been pronounced to them, by an involuntary me&s;&s;enger, and all agreed in his election. Such was his humour, that it is &s;aid, at fir&s;t he conceived the holy body, though met in &s;olemn convention, were returning the je&s;t upon him when he was told they had elected him. Being a&s;&s;ured it was truth, he repented much of his facetiou&s;ne&s;s and je&s;ting; would willingly have refu&s;ed the no|mination, and cho&s;en to have enjoyed his &s;ecularity and benefice, with the plea|&s;ures of a life of liberty and ea&s;e, preferable to the &s;olemnities and &s;elf-denial of the cowl; and the toil, religious care, and &s;acred burden of the epi&s;copacy. Sy|meon, according to the religious prejudices of tho&s;e times, would not &s;uffer the account of this election to pa&s;s to po&s;terity without aggrandizing the event, by the relation of more miraculous circum&s;tances. Accordingly he writes, that a confirmation of the act of the chapter was heard di&s;tinctly pronounced from the
<PB N="89" REF="134">&s;hrine of St Cuthbert: After which they laid hands on Eadmund, and con&s;trained him to take the government of the church.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after this election, Eadmund, in the mo&s;t honourable manner, was pre&s;ented to Canute, who approved and confirmed the act of the chapter, and commanded he &s;hould be con&s;ecrated. Eadmund had &s;cruples yet remain|ing; his predece&s;&s;ors were all monks, and he was not willing to po&s;&s;e&s;s the See, until he had taken on him the religious habit: There he fir&s;t went through the ceremonies of the ton&s;ure, and then was con&s;ecrated at Winche&s;ter by Wul&s;tan archbi&s;hop of York. Symeon fixes his election in 1020, and his con&s;ecration in 1021<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Returning from Winche&s;ter, he vi&s;ited the mona&s;tery of Peterborough, where meeting with Egelricus, a monk of &s;trict church di&s;cipline, for whom he enter|tained a great affection, induced him to attend him to Durham, where he re&s;ided to the time of our prelate's death, as his bo&s;om friend, and was his great a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the government of his dioce&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e matters were tran&s;acting in this province, the king was taking the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to &s;ecure the crown to his po&s;terity. He fir&s;t devi&s;ed a means of taking off Edmund's children, who were yet in tender years, but much beloved of the people<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He gave them in charge to one of his dome&s;tics to carry them into Denmark, under colour of &s;ending them abroad to travel; but in reality, it was only to have it in his power the more ea&s;ily to di&s;patch them out of the way, when their ab&s;ence &s;hould have le&s;&s;ened the affections of the people. The per&s;on entru&s;ted with the princes, being con&s;cious of the king's de&s;igns, was touched with compa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e innocents, and in&s;tead of carrying them to Denmark, conducted them to the king of Sweden, di&s;covering at the &s;ame time his ma&s;ter's intentions. The king of Sweden gave the Engli&s;h princes a very civil reception; but how|ever, not to quarrel with Canute, he &s;ent them to the court of Soloman king of Hungary, his relation, who was willing to take care of their education.&mdash;Bromp. Knighton. M. We&s;tm.</NOTE>. Ethelred's two &s;ons, by his queen Emma, were in &s;afe|ty, under the protection of their uncle the duke of Normandy. To obviate their claim to the throne, he propo&s;ed to the duke to take Emma to be his queen, and give him in marriage E&s;trita his &s;i&s;ter; which being accepted, the &s;olemnities were performed with great magnificence. Alfred and Edward were much aver&s;e to this connection, as they had been educated with a dete&s;tation of their family's mortal enemy; and the wrath this marriage gave birth to, in the minds of the princes, was much encrea&s;ed by the queen's acceding to a &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion on her i&s;&s;ue by Canute, in their deprivation.</P>
<P>Matters of &s;tate being thus &s;ettled, the king began to rid him&s;elf of tho&s;e nobles who&s;e crimes and vices he abhorred, and who&s;e treacherous principles he feared. He bani&s;hed Eric earl of Northumberland: Turkil duke of Ea&s;t-Anglia, another object of his wrath, fled in fear of his &s;everer &s;entence; and Edric duke of Mer|cia he found means to get rid of, without the appearance of predetermination. Having reproached the king one day for not rewarding the important &s;ervices he rendered him, in cutting off the life of the brave Edmund, his brother-in-law, in which, it is &s;aid, he even employed his own &s;on to give him a mortal wound: The king an&s;wered in a rage, &s;ince he was &s;o audacious as to boa&s;t of the horrid trea&s;on, of which he had only &s;tood di&s;tantly &s;u&s;pected, he &s;hould receive his me|rited
<PB N="90" REF="135">reward; and in&s;tantly commanded him to be beheaded, and his body thrown into the Thames: Which &s;entence was executed in the palace. Thus it is, that evil mini&s;ters, after they have &s;erved their monarch's ba&s;e&s;t wi&s;hes, are de&s;pi|&s;ed, dreaded, and at la&s;t cut off from the face of the earth.</P>
<P>Canute, having e&s;tabli&s;hed excellent rules of civil polity, and taken every wi&s;e mea&s;ure for the due and impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, at length &s;aw him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the affections of his people, his government &s;ecure, and his realm in peace. In this happy &s;ea&s;on, he made expeditions to Denmark, and &s;ettled the government there; effected the conque&s;t of Norway; and, having reaped abun|dance of laurels, after his return to England, gave his mind to the advancement of religion. This induced him to make a journey to Rome, from whence he re|turned to complete the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment and pious works he had begun. The hi&s;torians of that time, who were chiefly religious, tran&s;mit his actions to po&s;terity with lavi&s;h prai&s;es: The more moderate affirm, that for &s;ome years be|fore his death, he became humble, mode&s;t, ju&s;t, and truly religious.</P>
<P>Our prelate was fortunate in entering upon his See in a reign when the invete|rate enemies of the Chri&s;tian faith were declining rapidly; and the Danes becom|ing Chri&s;tians, appeared patrons and protectors of the church they &s;o often injured. As if the king took upon him&s;elf the atonement and expiation of all the per&s;e|cutions St Cuthbert's church had &s;uffered from his countrymen, he vi&s;ited the church at Durham; not in regal pomp, parade, and pageantry, but with the hu|miliations of a penitent, and with every &s;olemnity of piety and religion. This victorious monarch's approach to the holy &s;hrine, was an affecting &s;pectacle of religious duty, which the &s;pectator mu&s;t have beheld with pious veneration, and great emotion of mind, which magnificence could not excite, or &s;plendor effect. He, with his whole retinue, from a place probably named from the incident, <HI>Trimdane,</HI> proceeded in this holy pilgrimage by Garmund&s;way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;.&mdash;L$l. Col. v. i. p. 1$$.</NOTE>, to the Saint's &s;hrine, a di&s;tance in tho&s;e days called five miles, dive&s;ted of all en&s;igns of royalty, and even with naked feet. He made donations to the church of various lands; his man&s;ion-hou&s;e of Staindrope, alias Standrop, with its appendages, viz.

<P>The king, having &s;pent &s;everal years in acts of devotion, departed this life in the year 1035, or 1036, in the 19th year of his reign, leaving his &s;everal king|do$ in peace to his children. Sweyn, his elde&s;t &s;on, he appointed to reign over Denmark: Harold, his &s;econd &s;on, England; and Hardicanute, his &s;on by queen Emma, Norway; thereby totally counteracting the act of &s;ettlement made on his marriage, and di&s;appointing the hopes of his queen. This di&s;po&s;ition, however
<PB N="91" REF="136">di&s;agreeable to the Engli&s;h, the Danes were determined to fulfil; and Harold ha|ving, with much fore&s;ight, &s;eized the royal trea&s;ure at Winche&s;ter, was en$$$$d thereby to pacify &s;ome of the mo&s;t violent in the oppo&s;ition, and &s;ecure his co|ronation. We&s;&s;ex alone refu&s;ed for a time to acknowledge him their &s;overeign; but, Hardicanute not coming as they wi&s;hed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the opportunity offered of receiving the crown of that province, the people were brought over by earl Godwin, who had great power among&s;t them, to accede to Harold's &s;ove|reignty.</P>
<P>Emma, much chagrined by this revolution, began to devi&s;e means of re&s;toring her &s;ons by Ethelred to the crown of England; and for that purpo&s;e &s;ent to Al|fred to come over from Normandy, that he might make him&s;elf per&s;onally known to the Engli&s;h nobles. But on his arrival, being betrayed by the king's party in|to a &s;nare, concerted by earl Godwin, who had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into queen Emma's confidence, he was carried to Guildford Ca&s;tle, where his eyes were put out; and afterwards, being &s;hut up in a mona&s;tery, he died through di&s;appoint|ment and grief. Soon afterwards, Emma was ordered to depart the kingdom, and retired to Bruges in Flanders. Harold did not &s;urvive the&s;e tran&s;actions long, having done few acts in church or &s;tate that were memorable. Leaving no i&s;&s;ue, Hardicanute obtained a much ea&s;ier means of acce&s;&s;ion than at that in&s;tant he was devi&s;ing, being then at Bruges concerting means to recover the kingdom of We&s;&s;ex; to which projects the news of Harold's death put a ha&s;ty conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>He &s;et &s;ail for England with forty &s;hips, which e&s;corted him from Norway. On his landing, he was received by both Engli&s;h and Danes with acclamations of joy. His coronation was no &s;ooner over, than he committed an infamous act of indig|nity on the corp&s;e of his interred brother and predece&s;&s;or, which he cau&s;ed to be taken from the &s;epulchre, beheaded, and thrown naked into the Thames; Alfric archbi&s;hop of York, earl Godwin, Styr the chamberlain, and Edric the &s;ewer, being employed in this execrable act of revenge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;. p. 76.&mdash;Sym.

<P>In the la&s;t year of Harold's reign, or about the time of Hardicanute's acce&s;&s;ion, in the 20th year of Eadmund's pontificate, about the year 1040, Duncan king of Scotland, with a va&s;t army, made an irruption into Northumberland, and be|&s;et Durham, where many &s;evere conflicts en&s;ued; but at length, by a fortunate &s;ally of the be&s;ieged, the Scots hor&s;e were put to the rout, the lines of the be|&s;iegers thrown into confu&s;ion, and the foot were cut to pieces. The heads of their leaders, collected together, were &s;u&s;pended on poles around the market-place.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that Symeon is the only author who mentions this a&s;&s;ault, and a&s;&s;igns no cau&s;e for it. Be&s;ides, it is not &s;aid that Durham was made defen|&s;ible, by nature &s;trong and lofty, or that it had any fortification<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 165.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is great uncertainty and confu&s;ion in this period, touching the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the earls of Northumberland. Rapin &s;peaks po&s;itively of the bani&s;hment of Eric, but gives no account who &s;ucceeded him. From other authorities, Eadul&s;,
<PB N="92" REF="137">&s;urnamed Cudel, is mentioned as Eric's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, brother to Uchtred. He is re|pre&s;ented as a man of pu&s;illanimous nature, and &s;luggi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition. The &s;ur|render of the Lothians to the Scots is attributed to him, he thereby purcha&s;ing their alliance and peace. There is much uncertainty, from the contradictory ac|counts given of that matter, when the Lothians were fir&s;t &s;urrendered and detach|ed from Northumberland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii.</NOTE>. Uchtred, it is &s;aid, was &s;lain by Turebrand. Al|dred, Uchtred's &s;on, was Cudel's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who revenged the death of his father by &s;laying Turebrand, and afterwards fell a &s;acrifice to the vengeance of Curl, Tu|rebrand's &s;on. Aldred was &s;ucceeded by his brother Eadulf. He had &s;ome di&s;|putes with the Welch, on whom he made depredations, which gave great di&s;plea&s;ure to Hardicanute; to who&s;e pre&s;ence being commanded, in order to make retribu|tion, and &s;ue for terms of reconciliation, was &s;lain by Siward, who &s;ucceeded to the earldom. Such were the prevailing cu&s;toms and horrid manners of tho&s;e days; times of imminent peril, when even the viceroys of &s;uch powerful provinces were cut off, in dreadful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by the hands of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, under the au&s;pices of kings.</P>
<P>Eadmund governed his church with great dignity and honour. He was a man of excellent principles and rectitude of mind. During his epi&s;copacy the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the church were greatly augmented, and its rights well maintained. He exer|ci&s;ed juri&s;diction over the church at Hexham, though his right was que&s;tioned by the archbi&s;hop of York, who, under his archiepi&s;copal authority, claimed to have the guardian&s;hip of that vacated bi&s;hopric<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 378.</NOTE>. He fini&s;hed the we&s;tern tower of the new church at Durham, begun by Aldune, and con&s;ecrated it<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Anglia Sacra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During this epi&s;copacy, there was a prie&s;t belonging the church, called Aelfrid, a man of &s;evere virtue, and religious au&s;terity. With this character he is al&s;o &s;aid to have lived in great &s;obriety; was a liberal be&s;tower of alms, and &s;tudious of the powers of eloquence and per&s;ua&s;ion. He was the terror of the la&s;civious and immode&s;t, and held in high veneration by the pious and ju&s;t; was zealou&s;ly devo|ted to the &s;ervice of St Cuthbert, and a rigid maintainer of the rights of the church. This man, by a vi&s;ion, was commanded to collect, from the ancient mona&s;teries and churches in Northumberland, the remains of holy per&s;onages buried there. He obtained the bones of Baltherus and Balfridus, anchorites; of Accae and Alch|mund, bi&s;hops of Hexham; and king O&s;wine; of the venerable abbe&s;&s;es, Ebba and Ethelgitha; all which he tran&s;lated to Durham, and placed near the body of St Cuthbert. He al&s;o brought from Melros the bones of St Boi&s;il, St Cuthbert's preceptor, which he depo&s;ited in a &s;hrine near that of the Saint. He al&s;o tran&s;|lated to this church, from Girwy, the remains of St Bede; and did many other pious works<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm, p. 165, 166.&mdash;Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 330, 378, 379.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop, in the 23d year of his epi&s;copacy, having travelled to Glouce&s;ter, to attend the king, was &s;eized with a mortal di&s;ea&s;e, and died there. His remains were brought to Durham to be interred.</P>
<P>If credit is to be given to Symeon's evidence, our prelate, after his election, was not con&s;ecrated until after he had been pre&s;ented to the king for his confirma|tion.
<PB N="93" REF="138">It is the fir&s;t in&s;tance in the hi&s;tory of this church of that practice, and per|haps was in con&s;equence of &s;ome new e&s;tabli&s;hment made by Canute.</P>

He &s;eized the trea&s;ures of the church, and, by an immoderate gift, purcha&s;ed a no|mination from the reigning prince, who had as little virtue or religion as him&s;elf. But his iniquity had a &s;hort reign; for he was &s;mitten with a lingering and painful di&s;ea&s;e, in which he became bedridden for ten months; and, without enjoying the lea&s;t fruits of his &s;inful purcha&s;e, departed this life, dete&s;ted and de&s;pi&s;ed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>Symeon, who relates this matter, leaves it totally in the dark in what manner this purcha&s;e was effected, and whether the king u&s;ed any compul&s;ory mea&s;ures to obtain his election from the body of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, or he u&s;urped a power of no|mination, without their concurrence. If he came before the king with the chap|ter's election, the nece&s;&s;ity of a bribe doth not appear.

<P>During the dete&s;table reign of Hardicanute, which continued only three years, Siward earl of Northumberland was in the commi&s;&s;ion for executing the king's vengeance upon Worce&s;ter, which was &s;acked and reduced to a&s;hes, for refu&s;ing to contribute to an enormous &s;um he demanded for payment of his navy. The king is &s;uppo&s;ed to have died gorged with an over-meal, his whole time being de|bauched with gluttony and ebriety.

<P>In the year 1042, upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward the Third, called <HI>the Confe&s;&s;or,</HI> EGELRIC, a monk, brought hither from Peterborough by Eadmund when returning from his con&s;ecration at Winche&s;ter, was made bi&s;hop of this See. It appears, that &s;ome undue influence of the crown was u&s;ed in this ca&s;e; for it is &s;aid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ingulph&mdash;Wharton.</NOTE>, that he ob|tained the See by the power of earl Godwin: And Symeon writes, that, in the third year of his epi&s;copacy, the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of this church prote&s;ting again&s;t him, as being a member of another religious body, and extraneous there, and that he had been appointed their bi&s;hop contrary to their will, they expelled him the church. On this exigency, he had recour&s;e to earl Siward, who at that time po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed very great power and authority, having the government of all the country from Humber to Tweed. By a pa&s;&s;ionate repre&s;entation of his injuries, and a warm application of rich pre&s;ents, he procured his interce&s;&s;ion and influence with the adver&s;e body; who, terrified at his power and principles, willing or not, were reconciled to their bi&s;hop, and re&s;tored him to his pontifical function and honours. The innovations which appear to have attacked the church rights in this aera, are to be lamented<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 166.</NOTE>. It is indeed to be admitted, that the method of chu&s;ing a bi&s;hop by the chapter, though le&s;s foreign than the exce&s;&s;es of the regale, was a deviation from the primitive practice; for by the ancient canons, a bi&s;hop ought to be cho&s;en by the metropolitan and his &s;uffragans; and, to prevent the incon|veniencies which would be derived from the interpo&s;ition of the &s;tate, the apo&s;tolic canons forbid the clergy making application to the &s;overeign for a bi&s;hopric, under the penalties of being depo&s;ed and excommunicated. Wharton &s;ays, Egelric was elected to the archbi&s;hopric of York; but, being unju&s;tly deprived, the See of Durham was &s;hortly after given him. From the authority of Florentius and Sy|meon it appears, that Alfric, the archbi&s;hop, having committed many acts of op|pre&s;&s;ion, and being charged with &s;undry mi&s;demeanors, having bu&s;ied him&s;elf too much in &s;ecular matters, was deprived by Hardicanute, and Egelric was appointed to the See; but, upon Edward's acce&s;&s;ion, making his peace with the crown, he was re&s;tored, and Egelric tran&s;lated to Durham<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 702.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On rea&s;&s;uming the pontificacy, Egelric &s;et about &s;ome religious works; parti|cularly the old church of Che&s;ter, where the remains of St. Cuthbert had re&s;ted above a century, was an erection of wood, and &s;tood a monument of the deplo|rable &s;tate of the arts in that age in which it was built. In honour to the patron Saint, he pulled it down, and built a church of &s;tone there<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 331.</NOTE>. The bi&s;hop is charged with having fallen into a &s;tate of indolence. He had for his a&s;&s;ociates his brother Egelwin, and &s;ome other monks, to whom he re&s;igned the chief manage|ment of the affairs of this See: And Symeon, with all the warmth of prejudice, &s;ays, that they, with the bi&s;hop, were &s;tudious to dimini&s;h the wealth and orna|ments of the church, and to purloin its riches, whenever occa&s;ion offered<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 167 159.</NOTE>. It
<PB N="96" REF="141">is not probable that the bi&s;hop, coming to this See in the manner he did, and a &s;econd time forced upon the eccle&s;ia&s;tics after they had gone to &s;uch extremities as to expel him, would live in cordiality with the religious body: The animo&s;ity of each party would break out at intervals to embitter their di&s;putes and di&s;&s;en|tions; and, con&s;equently, a de&s;ire of encrea&s;ing the honours and riches of the See, would be very languid in this prelate. Symeon adds, that when the work-people were laying a deep foundation for the new church at Che&s;ter, a very great trea&s;ure was di&s;covered, hidden as it was pre&s;umed, by the officers of the avari|cious bi&s;hop Sexhelm, who, being obliged to ab&s;cond, left it there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 168.</NOTE>. But it is more probable it was a more ancient concealment, when Che&s;ter was a place of &s;trength; and this appears to have been the ca&s;e; for the bi&s;hop, looking upon the trea&s;ure as no part of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the church, but as a trea&s;ure-trove within his deme&s;ne, &s;ent it to his mona&s;tery of Peterborough, then conceiving an intention of retiring thither him&s;elf<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">One of the laws of Edward, made for the benefit and protection of the church, or, as Sir H. Spelman denotes them, "Provi&s;ions extracted from the laws of his predece&s;&s;ors," No. 13. is to this effect: <Q>All &startq;trea&s;ure-trove belongs to the king, unle&s;s it is found in a church or church-yard: In that ca&s;e the gold &endq;is all the kings; the &s;ilver is to be divided in moieties; to the crown one, to the church the other.</Q> In this ca&s;e Egelric &s;tood in the place of the crown.</NOTE>. Had it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;acred things, or of money of the currency of Sexhelm's time, there would have been &s;ome better ac|count of it.</P>
<P>Shortly after this event, Egelric withdrew him&s;elf from the See, di&s;gu&s;ted at the conduct of the eccle&s;ia&s;tic body of his church; and, weary of an enmity which was incompatible with religion, he left the bi&s;hopric under the government of his brother Egelwin. The riches he removed to Peterborough he employed in works not only magnificent, but al&s;o of public utility; as bridges, cau&s;eways, and other accommodations for the &s;ubject at large; and al&s;o therewith erected &s;everal church|es. From the uninterrupted friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Egelric and the excellent prelate Eadmund, to the clo&s;e of his life, the candid mind is induced to con&s;ider our bi&s;hop in a more favourable light than Symeon would place him. From this familiarity, it is ju&s;t to determine he was a man of many virtues, and of exten&s;ive judgment. With the&s;e &s;et in contra&s;t to the prejudices the mona&s;tic writer would in&s;til, it is but candid to &s;pare his character from contumely, and give his memory to po&s;terity, with the good works he executed, without the par|tial and local &s;tigmas he &s;tands blotted with in the church-hi&s;tory. He came to the See when the prerogative of the crown was extended beyond the ancient li|mits which protected the privileges of the &s;ubject; and, conceiving he did no in|jury to his church in employing the accidental riches he recovered in public works out of the territories of St Cuthbert, his life &s;eems not to merit the con|demnation it is branded with. Amid&s;t the vexatious wranglings of his di&s;&s;ident clergy, it is no &s;urpri&s;e he committed the government of the See to others, with|out any motives from indolence and &s;upinene&s;s. His abdication was not an act worthy of great cen&s;ure, con&s;idering he was only retiring from confu&s;ion, and all tho&s;e di&s;tractions which aro&s;e in an enmity and oppo&s;ition, &s;uch as had gained

But it &s;eems that the wrath of his foes pur|&s;ued him to the grave: For, being accu&s;ed to William the Norman of having robbed the church of its trea&s;ures, he was commanded to appear before the king in London, was committed to &s;afe cu&s;tody till his ca&s;e &s;hould be heard, and died in pri&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym.

<P>Hi&s;torians have di&s;puted the propriety of Edward's acce&s;&s;ion in preference of Edmund's &s;on, and Sweyn the &s;on of Canute; but a di&s;qui&s;ition of that nature is foreign to the pre&s;ent narrative. The matter was effected by the interpo&s;ition of earl Godwin, who&s;e intere&s;t was not obtained with any great difficulty, though Edward had &s;o recently been his per&s;ecutor. The &s;tate came to a determination, that no one of Dani&s;h race &s;hould again wield the Engli&s;h &s;ceptre; and it may be pre&s;umed an edict was publi&s;hed for aboli&s;hing the name and di&s;tinction of Dane in England from thenceforth; for that people are not from that period mention|ed in hi&s;tory, as if the whole race had been extinct, though in the immediate pre|ceding year they were ma&s;ters of the kingdom. This &s;trange circum&s;tance gave occa&s;ion to the ob&s;cure and ill-&s;upported relations of a ma&s;&s;acre immediately &s;uc|ceeding Edward's coming to the crown. This prince was not di&s;tingui&s;hed for his genius, or the powers of his under&s;tanding; but, for his animo&s;ity and in&s;atiable re&s;entment towards his mother, he was infamous; depriving her, in an advanced age, of all the comforts of life; and &s;he, who had been queen to two great po|tentates, and the mother of two, was reduced, by his &s;everity, to langui&s;h out the weary remnant of life in extreme poverty. Such was the man who&s;e name is di&s;tingui&s;hed with the holy characters of <HI>Saint</HI> and <HI>Confe&s;&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>The di&s;putes which were agitated between the king and earl Godwin, are in no ways pertinent to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. On the earl's death, his &s;on Harold, of &s;u|perior parts and abilities, &s;ucceeded to his honours. About this period, a con|te&s;t ari&s;ing between Macbeth and Malcolm, two princes of Scotland, for the pro|vince of Cumberland, the king commanded Siward, with the forces of Northum|berland, to re&s;tore Malcolm to the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that territory, which he ef|fected in one deci&s;ive battle. Some hi&s;torians &s;peak of this matter, as if Mal|colm then obtained the crown of Scotland; but this po&s;ition is not &s;upported by their chronology. Fordun places Malcolm's acce&s;&s;ion to the crown in 1057, two years after Siward's death, which appears the mo&s;t probable. The joy of this victory was damped by the lo&s;s of the earl's gallant &s;on, who was among the &s;lain<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun.</NOTE>. When the melancholy news was brought to his father, he did not give way to any parental feelings till he &s;atisfied his honour that the youth died with|out di&s;grace. He interrogated the me&s;&s;engers impatiently, <Q>Where were his &startq;&endq;wounds?</Q> To which they replied, "They were on his brea&s;t." With an ex|tacy of heroic virtue he exclaimed, <Q>I thank God the boy hath done his duty, &startq;&endq;and I am reconciled:</Q> To which his tenderer tears &s;ucceeded<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Huntingd.</NOTE>. The earl did not &s;urvive this victory long: He was &s;eized with the bloody-flux, which &s;oon pro|ved mortal; and his remains were interred in the cloi&s;ter of the mona&s;tery of St
<PB N="98" REF="143">Mary, without the walls of York, which he founded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brompt.</NOTE>. On the approach of death, whil&s;t he langui&s;hed deeply under his di&s;ea&s;e, regarding an exit in bed as di&s;graceful to a man of his heroic &s;pirit, he commanded his armour to be brought, in which he was accoutred, that, agreeable to a wi&s;h he had repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed whil&s;t in health, <HI>he might expire, as he had lived, in arms.</HI> Brompton de&s;cribes him as a man of mo&s;t gigantic &s;tature, and of an intrepidity &s;uitable to his form. As his grandmother, the daughter of a Dani&s;h earl, was walking in a wood, ac|companied by her women, near her father's hou&s;e, a bear ru&s;hed from the fore&s;t, and bore her off from her affrighted attendants. By this mon&s;ter &s;he was ra|vi&s;hed, and had a &s;on named Bernus, who was born with bear's ears. He, in right of his mother, &s;ucceeded to the earldom, and, proving a valiant &s;oldier, e&s;pou&s;ed a lady of equal rank, on whom he begot the brave earl Siward, who came and &s;ettled in England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 945.</NOTE>. Thus, in allegory, is wrapped up the rape of this lady, by &s;ome powerful per&s;on of the country.</P>
<P>On the death of Siward, To&s;ti, one of the &s;ons of earl Godwin, was made earl of Northumberland; and, by his influence<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 379.</NOTE>, EGELWIN was confirmed in the bi&s;hopric of Durham, abdicated by his brother. He was al&s;o a monk of the mona&s;tery of Peterborough. Symeon places this event in the 15th year of Edward's reign, A. D. 1056: And this bi&s;hop's appointment &s;eems to be an arbitrary act of the earl, by who&s;e &s;upport and favour Symeon &s;ays he was advanced. During his brother's epi&s;copacy, he managed, as &s;uffragan, all the &s;ecular affairs of the See, and thereby, it is pre&s;umed, ama&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable trea&s;ure<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ridpath, in his Border Hi&s;tory, &s;ays, that Malcolm of Scotland made a wa&s;ting inroad into the pro|vince of Northumberland, in To&s;ti's ab&s;ence, and violated the peace of St Cuthbert in Holy I&s;land. And, in a note from Sim. ad Ann. adds, that To&s;ti, together with Kin&s;i archbi&s;hop of York, and Egelwin bi&s;hop of Durham, had conducted Malcolm to the pre&s;ence of Edward, two years before.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To&s;ti, of a tyrannical and moro&s;e temper, conducted him&s;elf with &s;uch rigour and oppre&s;&s;ive principles towards the Northumbrians, that their affections were &s;oon weaned from him: But, by the death of Go&s;patric, a per&s;on of great power in that province, and afterwards of two of his &s;ons, &s;lain by the earl's influence or procurement, and by the impo&s;ition of a grievous tax upon the inhabitants, he became dete&s;table, and, with one accord, they ro&s;e in arms to expel him the province, and demand his being depo&s;ed of the crown. Harold, by the com|mand of the king, at the head of a powerful army, met the in&s;urgents on the frontiers to compel their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but hearing the people's complaints, he tran&s;mitted a remon&s;trance to the king, &s;o powerfully loaded with proofs of into|lerable acts of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, that their pardon was not only granted, but Morcar, &s;on of the duke of Mercia, was appointed to the earldom; upon which To&s;ti fled from the king's wrath into Flanders.</P>
<PB N="99" REF="144">
<P>Soon after the&s;e tran&s;actions, the king was &s;eized with a mortal di&s;ea&s;e; and Harold a&s;cended the throne by the unanimous election of the people, in preference of Edgar Etheling, &s;on of prince Edward, and grand&s;on of Edmund, who was then in England.</P>
<P>We have &s;everal in&s;tances in our hi&s;tory, that, under the weake&s;t and wicked|e&s;t princes, our mo&s;t &s;alutary laws have i&s;&s;ued, and the noble&s;t principles of our con&s;titution have been e&s;tabli&s;hed. In them it was an involuntary act; they were made the mere in&s;truments of Providence, under the influence of wi&s;e coun|&s;ellors, to promulgate what they neither meant or under&s;tood, but which, in the will of Heaven, were pregnant with ble&s;&s;ings for generations unnumbered. One of tho&s;e incidents is in this reign, and perhaps took place when the &s;tates deter|mined to extingui&s;h the Dani&s;h name. The various laws which had gained accep|tation in the three great di&s;tricts of the kingdom, in We&s;&s;ex, the Saxon; in Mercia, the Mercian; and in Northumberland, the Dani&s;h; were reduced into one code, by which the whole country &s;hould be governed. Various parts of tho&s;e provincial laws could not be totally eradicated, having become riveted with the tenures of lands, and otherwi&s;e &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, that their u&s;age was obliged &s;till to be tolerated; and they were accordingly made con&s;i&s;tent to, and confirmed in, their peculiar di&s;tricts. It mu&s;t &s;uffice in this place to &s;ay, that in this matter is &s;een the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our common law, the mo&s;t excellent principles of which are derived from the Saxons; for as to the Danes, they left little that was elevated above brutality.</P>
<P>Earl To&s;ti, during the time he held the earldom of Northumberland, profe&s;&s;ed a great veneration for the church of St Cuthbert, which he, and Judith his wife, ornamented with many rich gifts, particularly a large crucifix of plated work in gold and &s;ilver, and decorated with jewels of high price: Al&s;o images of the Vir|gin Mary, and John the Evangeli&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>Harold did not wear the crown long in peace: He was fir&s;t di&s;turbed by his brother To&s;ti, who made &s;everal de&s;cents upon the coa&s;ts, and carried off much plunder. After repeated depredations in that manner, and retreats, he at length returned with a formidable armament, having engaged the king of Norway in the enterprize, under a delu&s;ive promi&s;e of conquering the kingdom. They at fir&s;t entered the river Tyne with a large fleet, and pillaged the country on each &s;ide of the river; after which they &s;ailed for the Humber, and there di&s;embarked. An engagement &s;oon after en&s;ued with the Northumbrian troops under earl Mor|car, and the we&s;tern forces, under Edwin earl of Che&s;ter, in which the invaders were victorious. Flu&s;hed with this &s;ucce&s;s, they marched forward to meet the royal army, which was advancing. A battle was &s;ought at a place called Stan|ford-bridge, near York, and the invaders &s;uffered a total defeat, the king of Nor|way and To&s;ti being among the &s;lain. Such was the horrid carnage of the day, that of the whole army that came from Norway in five hundred &s;hips, the re|mains returned in twenty, granted them by the victor. The booty which fell in|to
<PB N="100" REF="145">the hands of the king's army after this victory, was very con&s;iderable, there being found in the enemy's camp all the money and effects they brought with them, together with the riches they had heaped up from the pillage of the coun|try.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the king at re&s;t from the toils of war, occa&s;ioned by the late inva&s;ion, than he received intelligence that the duke of Normandy had landed with a large army in Su&s;&s;ex. He advanced with all po&s;&s;ible diligence to oppo&s;e this formidable enemy, who&s;e de&s;ign he was fully informed of; and the fatal battle of Ha&s;tings &s;oon after determined William's claim to the crown of England, by the death of the king, who received an arrow in his temple which pierced his brain, the total rout of the Engli&s;h army en&s;uing. What imputation fell on the character of the decea&s;ed &s;overeign, in a&s;cending the throne, or which was the greater crime, breaking the oath he made to William duke of Normandy, or gra|tifying his ambition by the exclu&s;ion of Edgar from the crown of his ance&s;tors, belongs not to the hi&s;torian to enquire. It is confe&s;&s;ed by all, that Harold po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed exalted virtues, and was endowed with all tho&s;e excellencies nece&s;&s;ary to form a great prince. He had a di&s;tingui&s;hed integrity of heart, was affable, and of engaging manners; and his genero&s;ity and munificence were truly princely. The impetuo&s;ity of his mind, and his too nice &s;en&s;e of honour, perhaps were his greate&s;t failings, and principally tended to his fall.</P>
<P>Morcar earl of Northumberland, with the northern troops, retired to London; where, in every a&s;&s;embly in which the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was agitated, he &s;trenu|ou&s;ly &s;upported the cau&s;e of Edgar. When the duke moved his army towards the city, the confu&s;ion of the people, and divided opinions of the nobles, &s;ufficiently proved to the earl, that all oppo&s;ition to the Normans would prove ineffectual; therefore he withdrew his forces, and retired to the north. Soon afterwards, the keys of the city gates were &s;urrendered; the &s;mall number of bi&s;hops and lay|lords then in London, in a pu&s;illanimous manner, made a tender of the &s;ceptre; and, on Chri&s;tmas-day following, in the year 1066, he was crowned king of Eng|land.

<P>The king having e&s;tabli&s;hed a mode of government, and placed garri&s;ons of Norman troops in all the fortre&s;&s;es, he propo&s;ed a vi&s;it to Normandy. To &s;ecure the &s;tate from con&s;piracy and in&s;urrection in his ab&s;ence, he took with him &s;eve|ral of the mo&s;t powerful of the nobility, among whom earl Morcar was one, who thought them&s;elves no better than ho&s;tages in his train, and were di&s;turbed as being exhibited as ornaments to his triumph. Whil&s;t the king was ab&s;ent, the intolerable oppre&s;&s;ions of the regents occa&s;ioned a general di&s;content, and two for|midable in&s;urrections &s;ucceeded, which ha&s;tened his return. From thenceforth mutual jealou&s;ies between the &s;overeign and his people were daily fomented, which grew up to a terrible degree of vehemence on the odious tax of Danegelt being revived, and levied on the lands with the utmo&s;t rigour. This was followed by a tyrannical confi&s;cation of the e&s;tates of tho&s;e who appeared in arms for their &s;o|vereign Harold, which was one of the mo&s;t remarkable events of this reign;
<PB N="101" REF="146">for the confi&s;cated lands were given to the Normans, who thereby became more con&s;iderable in England than the Engli&s;h them&s;elves: But from thence were de|rived great power and advantage to the king; for he not only filled his coffers with riches, but al&s;o, by &s;uch di&s;tribution of his chiefs in all quarters of the land, who were firmly devoted to his &s;ervice, he gained a powerful intere&s;t to &s;upport him on the throne.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the lamentations and rage of the people were every where heard, and execrations ince&s;&s;antly poured forth from innumerable lips again&s;t the tyrant, afflicted with the mi&s;eries which &s;urrounded them, Edwin earl of Che&s;ter, and Morcar earl of Northumberland, took up arms, and carried their forces into the field, pre&s;uming from the general di&s;tre&s;s an in&s;urrection would take place in every part of the kingdom. This wore a &s;erious countenance, and obliged the king, with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, to collect his troops, and move towards the north, to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion in its infancy. The expedition the king u&s;ed, and his formidable army of veteran &s;oldiers, intimidated the people in other parts of the land from taking up arms. The northern earls finding them&s;elves di&s;appointed in the event, and not able &s;ingly and un&s;upported to try the conflict, were obli|ged to &s;ubmit and &s;ue for mercy. The king approaching York, the citizens brought the keys of their gates, and laid them at his feet. But, though this act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion procured them an exemption from corporal puni&s;hment, yet their pardon did not extend &s;o far as to &s;ecure them from a heavy fine, which he impo|&s;ed on the city; and they with grief beheld the walls of a fortre&s;s ri&s;e in the heart of their city, which &s;hould for ever after overawe them, garri&s;oned with Norman &s;oldiers. The earls of Che&s;ter and Northumberland, with Archil, a powerful Northumbrian lord, and Egelwin bi&s;hop of Durham, were received to the king's clemency, and &s;wearing their fealty, were pardoned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a paper among the Burghleian MSS. touching the title of Lord Willughby of Ere&s;by, &s;hew|ing how this barony, before the conque&s;t, belonged to the See of Durham; and that at the conque&s;t, by the Conqueror, with the bi&s;hop's con&s;ent, it was given to Pinzon, who thereby became lord of Ere&s;by: And his tenure was, to &s;erve the &s;aid bi&s;hop at Dure&s;me at the day of his con&s;ecration, in the office of &s;teward; which &s;ervice, by &s;pecial words in the grant, might not be done by any other deputy than his eld|e&s;t &s;on, being a knight, or by &s;ome other knight: Therefore it argued in him&s;elf a higher degree, as to be a baron: And the &s;ame &s;tile to be incident to the head manor of the barony, by name Ere&s;by; which ever had and hath divers manors, as members belonging to the &s;ame.

<PB N="103" REF="148">His rough and au&s;tere temper, the king conceived, would &s;uit well to counteract the licentious di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e he was to govern. When the Nor|thumbrians were informed of his approach, they at fir&s;t gave them&s;elves up to de|&s;pair, regarding him as a mon&s;ter &s;ent to afflict them with every &s;everity of tyran|nical government: Several fled their habitations, and &s;ought &s;helter in the fore&s;ts&punc; and others took &s;hipping for foreign countries.</P>
<P>Some of the fugitive Northumbrians who arrived in Denmark, pro&s;trated them&s;elves before Sweyn, the king, and, in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate phra&s;e, repre|&s;ented to him their mi&s;erable &s;tate, and the di&s;traction of their country; they implored his aid in the mo&s;t affecting language, and called for his pity as de&s;cend|ants of the Dani&s;h race. They a&s;&s;ured him, not only the Northumbrians would join his arms, but al&s;o the we&s;tern provinces, and a large body of troops from Scotland; they de&s;cribed the injuries and depo&s;ition of Edgar, their lawful &s;ove|reign, and moved him to compa&s;&s;ion. Rapin &s;ays, they per&s;uaded Sweyn the conque&s;t of England was practicable; and from that view chiefly he engaged in the enterprize: But the authorities tend more clearly to prove, that the attempt was calculated to expel the Normans in favour of Edgar. Whil&s;t a fleet was fit|ting out with a large armament from Denmark, earl Cumin arrived at Durham. The commotion which appeared among the people at the earl's approach, alarm|ed the bi&s;hop, and gave him &s;u&s;picions that an in&s;urrection was de&s;igned. The re&s;pectable author ju&s;t mentioned conceives it was a previous de&s;ign, that the fugitives to Denmark &s;hould &s;ue for &s;uccour from thence, the event of which the people then impatiently expected; and, "as Cumin's arrival might prove very prejudicial to the plan they had formed, the principal contrivers of the &s;cheme re&s;olved to rid them&s;elves of &s;o trouble&s;ome an in&s;pector, with his attendants." Whether this part of the hi&s;tory is maintainable or not, it is evident the bi&s;hop entertained fears for the earl's &s;afety, and when he met him at the limits of his bi&s;hopric, he informed him of the apprehen&s;ions he had of his danger; for he had heard it whi&s;pered by the populace, that they would never &s;ubmit to be go|verned by a &s;tranger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 181, 182.</NOTE>. The earl, with all the in&s;olence of a proud heart, treated the bi&s;hop's cautions with contempt; and, &s;o far from &s;hewing any acts of mode|ration and clemency on his fir&s;t approach, in order to remove the prejudices of the people, he puni&s;hed &s;everal who were landholders under the church, and had affronted him in his march, with &s;everity, and &s;ome he put to death. He was mi&s;taken in conceiving &s;uch mea&s;ures would &s;trike a terror on the country: Un|cultivated men, of a robu&s;t con&s;titution, and ferocious habits, are &s;eldom moved with fear; but, cheri&s;hing hatred of injuries, burn for revenge. The death of the pea&s;ants was a &s;ummons to un&s;heath the &s;word; and, though this was the &s;e|vere &s;ea&s;on of February, multitudes of men, from all quarters, a&s;&s;embled &s;oon af|ter the decline of day, and girt the city round with troops. The earl's guards had taken forcible po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;es as their wantonne&s;s incited, and, being di&s;per&s;ed through the place, in contempt of danger, gave them&s;elves up to ca&s;$
<PB N="104" REF="149">and &s;elf-enjoyment. Ju&s;t at the dawn of day, the a&s;&s;ailants broke open all the gates of the town, and flying in parties through every &s;treet, made a dreadful &s;laughter of the Normans; in&s;omuch that, Symeon &s;ays, the &s;treets were filled with blood and carca&s;&s;es. Many were &s;hut up in the hou&s;e where the earl lodged, and, defending it bravely, the enraged populace could not force an entrance; therefore, throwing in firebrands, they &s;et the edifice in flames. When tho&s;e within &s;aw the imminent peril to which they were reduced, they forced open the doors, and attempted to e&s;cape the fury of the fire, but were &s;lain as they came out. At length the building was reduced to a&s;hes, with every thing within its walls. The fire of this man&s;ion was &s;o vehement, that the flames were ob&s;erved to take hold of the we&s;tern tower of the church. The afflicting &s;pectacle alarm|ed the multitude: The religious, and inhabitants of the city, and even tho&s;e in arms, cea&s;ing from &s;laughter, fell upon their knees, with eyes filled with tears, and elevated hands, petitioning Heaven, that, by the aid of their holy Saint, and through his interpo&s;ition, the &s;acred edifice might be &s;pared from de&s;truction. Quickly the wind &s;hifted to the ea&s;t, and bore the flames from the church. Thus the earl, on the 2d of the kal. of February, A. D. 1069, with his 700 guards, (one man excepted, who e&s;caped with his wounds), were put to death.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remarked in this place, that the authors who give the foregoing ac|count, point out, that Durham, at that period, was defended by gates, and con|&s;equently by walls, pali&s;ades, or &s;ome other fortification u&s;ed in that age. It is mo&s;t probable the man&s;ion which was burnt was the bi&s;hop's palace, and not &s;olely appropriated for the earl's re&s;idence; and it di&s;tingui&s;hes, that the church did not &s;tand on the ground which the pre&s;ent cathedral covers, as that man&s;ion was to the we&s;t of it.</P>
<P>Soon after the &s;laughter of the Normans at Durham, the Dani&s;h armament ap|peared on the coa&s;t, under the command of O&s;bern, the king's brother; a large body of Scotti&s;h forces were immediately put in motion, attended by Edgar, and all the fugitive lords who had &s;ought a&s;ylum at Malcolm's court; the Northumbrians in general were in arms; and the whole uniting, gave &s;ome anxiety to the king. They marched immediately to York, where the Normans had a garri&s;on, &s;ome au|thors &s;ay, con&s;i&s;ting of 4000 men. In order to prevent the &s;uburbs being a &s;helter to the combined army, the troops in the ca&s;tle &s;et them on fire; and, in the confla|gration, the greate&s;t part of the city, the mona&s;tery and cathedral, were reduced to a&s;hes. The friends of literature, on this occa&s;ion, came to a dreadful lo&s;s, by the de&s;truction of a valuable library, the collection of which was begun &s;o early as the latter end of the eighth century. The a&s;&s;ailants &s;tormed the citadel, and put the whole garri&s;on to the &s;word. After this blow, Earl Waltheof was placed in the ca&s;tle with Engli&s;h troops, and the army retired a little from York, to an advan|tageous po&s;t, where they lay fortified, waiting the king's approach. After conci|liating the minds of &s;ome malcontents in the &s;outhern parts of England, by acts of clemency, ju&s;tice and relaxation, the king moved his army by &s;low marches to|wards the enemy. He was &s;o provoked with the Northumbrians, that he was heard
<PB N="105" REF="150">to &s;wear by his u&s;ual oath, <HI>by God's &s;plendor,</HI> he would not leave a &s;oul alive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoved.&mdash;Rapin.</NOTE>. As &s;oon as he entered York&s;hire he began to put his horrid threats into execution, by permitting his troops to commit every exce&s;s, to ravage, plunder, and de&s;troy, as the wantonne&s;s of avarice, lu&s;t, cruelty, and revenge might dictate. The com|bined army lay in their fortifications, determined to receive the foe in that &s;itua|tion; but the king &s;aw too much peril in an attempt to engage them &s;o advanta|geou&s;ly placed. The leaders lay for &s;ome time inactive, whil&s;t detached parties of Normans were let loo&s;e to de&s;olate the adjacent country, and, with the &s;courge of de&s;truction, to puni&s;h the mi&s;erable and innocent for the defections of tho&s;e with whom they had no criminal part. But &s;uch are generally the indi&s;criminate ravages of war. Whil&s;t the king revolved in his mind the hazard in which an unfortunate battle might involve his crown, he determined to try the power of money, and to corrupt O&s;bern with a bribe. The effect equalled his mo&s;t &s;an|guine wi&s;h; for the Dane took the gold, drew off his troops, and &s;et &s;ail for Den|mark, leaving the confederates in a deplorable &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence and di&s;appoint|ment. At length mo&s;t of the forces left in the intrenchments marched off in de|files, and returned home, leaving Waltheof, and his garri&s;on, to &s;u&s;tain the king's wrath in a &s;iege. The earl was &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the mo&s;t &s;kilful and brave&s;t generals of the age; and, by his prudent conduct, &s;upported the defence with &s;uch bravery, that the king, after innumerable a&s;&s;aults, and a tedious blockade, had gained no advantages, and began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, when the want of provi&s;ions obliged the gallant governor to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the &s;overeign's mercy. There are charms in bravery which win the hearts of the brave, even from the horrid po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of pride, jealou&s;y, and revenge. The king, charmed with Wal|theof's military excellence, granted the garri&s;on the mo&s;t honourable terms, and not only pardoned the earl<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;.</NOTE>, but received him to his bo&s;om; won him to be his friend by his royal munificence, and loaded him with marks of e&s;teem. He gave him in marriage his niece, daughter to the counte&s;s of Albemarle; and, to &s;up|port the dignity of the alliance, made him earl of Northampton and Huntington. The king received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of earl Go&s;patric, who, with a large &s;um, pur|cha&s;ed the earldom of Northumberland; a dignity which he a&s;pired to, as being de&s;cended from a former race of earls, his mother Algitha being daughter of earl Uchtred, by his wife Elfgiva, daughter of king Ethelred. Algitha's hu&s;band, and the father of Go&s;patric, was Maldred, the &s;on of Crinan, who was progeni|tor of the noble family of Nevills, of whom, in the &s;equel, there will be occa&s;ion to &s;peak<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Baro. v. i. p. 287.</NOTE>. It is related by Symeon, that Morcar, after his advancement to the earldom of Northumberland, being occupied in other great affairs, gave the go|vernment of the country beyond the Tyne to O&s;ulph, a youth, &s;on of Eadulf, who was earl Uchtred's brother and &s;ucce&s;&s;or. According to the &s;ame author, the king, having deprived O&s;ulph of his government, conferred it on Cop&s;i, uncle to earl To&s;ti, a man of wi&s;dom and experience in the affairs of government, and who had formerly the charge of the province, whil&s;t To&s;ti was earl. O&s;ulph

The &s;everity of the winter rendered the night air intolerable to the aged and infirm, as well as tho&s;e of $ender years; and much lamentation was heard among the people; when, by a particular interpo&s;ition, the &s;ea retired, and left a dry pa&s;&s;age for the wanderers, who, with loud thank&s;giving and holy joy, pa&s;&s;ed over to the i&s;land. And what completed the miracle, was, as Symeon &s;ays, tho&s;e who carried the Saint's remains gave evidence, that, as &s;oon as the multitude had pa&s;&s;ed, the &s;ea returned, and clo&s;ed up the vacancy, which a few moments before had divided the waters.</P>
<P>Peace being re&s;tored, and the king having withdrawn his troops, the bi&s;hop, with his brethren and people, &s;et forward on their return, with &s;teps of melan|choly, and many tears, beholding the fertile plains laid wa&s;te, the villages de&s;o|late, the whole country depopulated, and become a dreadful &s;olitude. After an ab&s;ence of four months, they entered the city on the 8th of the kal. of April, A.

But, on their return, they found the crucifix thrown down, and &s;tripped of all the gold, &s;ilver, and gems, that formerly adorned it.

This coming to Go&s;patric's ear, attended with the circum&s;tance of Gillo's &s;udden death on the night of the vi&s;ion, he was &s;eized with a religious horror, and the torments of an afflicted con&s;cience; and, to expiate his crime, immediately &s;et out on a pilgri|mage to Holy I&s;land, with naked feet, during an inclement winter, &s;eeking remi&s;|&s;ion of the Saint, by prayers, tears, and rich gifts.

<P>Soon after the king left the Northumbrian territories, Malcolm king of Scot|land made an inroad by way of Cumberland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

At Hunderthwaite, a place op|po&s;ite to Egle&s;ton, the people of Tee&s;dale made a &s;tand, and were routed with great &s;laughter.

Enraged by the&s;e repeated &s;ufferings, the Scotti&s;h king committed the mo&s;t horrid cruelties upon the people<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ford. l. v. c. 18.</NOTE>, and carried &s;uch multitudes into captivity, that, for many years after, &s;carce a cottage in Scotland was de&s;titute of Engli&s;h &s;laves.

<P>After &s;o much on the affairs of the &s;tate at large, it is high time to advert to that momentous aera, in which there was a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the tenures of lands, a reformation of the &s;ervice of the &s;ubject, and an introduction of tho&s;e feodal principles under which the people groaned for many centuries. The king was con|vinced by the late circum&s;tance of calling in the Danes, that the re&s;tle&s;s temper of the Engli&s;h, impatient of injuries, and forward to revenge, would never &s;ub|mit to a total &s;ubver&s;ion of their laws and liberties, whil&s;t any power or autho|rity remained in their hands; in &s;hort, whil&s;t they were not &s;tripped of every thing valuable: And he formed his re&s;olutions accordingly. He immediately di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of all the baronies and fiefs they held of the crown, and gave the &s;ame to
<PB N="109" REF="154">his own retainers, even with an a&s;toni&s;hing degree of profu&s;ion. His brother Robert held of his gift, with the earldom of Cornwall, 846 manors; and &s;everal others had little inferior. Hugh Lupus of Almonches, the king's &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, had the county palatine of Che&s;ter, with all royal prerogatives, to hold it in as ample &s;overeignty as the king held his crown. It is needle&s;s to name more of tho&s;e; and the latter is named only becau&s;e, in the progre&s;s of this narrative, frequent occa&s;ion will be had to refer to it. Each grandee was to furni&s;h hor&s;emen with arms, at the king's command; and they, granting out their exten&s;ive di&s;tricts in manors and &s;maller e&s;tates, re&s;erved the &s;ervices proportionably from tho&s;e who held the lands. It was not only the lay-property that was thus handled, but al&s;o the church-lands were made liable to furni&s;h hor&s;emen and arms in the &s;ame pro|portion, notwith&s;tanding the immunities the Saxon princes had ordained, when the ancient charters were granted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A modern author &s;peaking of the Franks, &s;ays, "The landed e&s;tates of the clergy grew &s;o great, that in time the military power of the kingdom was much enfeebled; for though they were obliged to furni&s;h men for the wars, according as the lands they held were liable to that &s;ervice, this was performed with &s;uch backwardne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency, that the &s;tate at one time was near overturned, and it became nece&s;|&s;ary to provide a remedy."&mdash;Sullivan's Lectures, lect. v. p. 54.
<P>The &s;imilarity between our Saxon laws and tho&s;e mentioned above, need not be pointed out to the ju|dicious reader.</P>
<P>We find the laws of William I. are in general little other than tran&s;cripts of the Saxon laws or cu&s;toms: However there are two which were intended to alter the military policy of the kingdom, and to aboli&s;h the <HI>trinoda nece&s;&s;itas;</HI> and, in its lieu, to make the lands of the Engli&s;h, and of the church, liable to knights-&s;ervice, as the Normans lands were by their new grants, and thereby make the &s;y&s;tem uniform. His 52d law is entirely in feudal terms, and was certainly drawn up by &s;ome per&s;on &s;killed in that law for the purpo&s;e. It runs thus: <Q>Statuimus, ut omnes liberi homines &s;aedere &amp; &s;acramento affirment, quod &startq;intra et extra univer&s;um regnum Angliae Willielmo domino &s;uo fideles e&s;&s;e volunt, $erras &amp; honores il|lius &endq;ubique &s;ervare cum co &amp; contra inimicos &amp; alienigenas de&s;endere.</Q>&mdash;L L. Angl. Sax. ap. Wil|kins, p. 228.&mdash;Wright on Tenures, p. 66.&mdash;Sullivan, 265.</P>
<P>William's 58th law is to this effect: <Q>We enact and firmly command, that all earls, barons, and knights, &startq;and &s;ervants, (that is the lower &s;oldiers not knighted, who had not yet got lands, but were quartered on the abbeys), and all the freemen, (namely the Saxon freeholders, and the tenants of the church, which now was &s;ubjected to knights-&s;ervice) of our whole afore&s;aid kingdom, &s;hall have and keep them&s;elves well in arms, and in hor&s;es, as is &s;itting, and their duty; and that they &s;hould be always ready and well prepared to fulfil and to act when&s;oever occa&s;ion &s;hall be; according to what they ought by law to do for us from their fiefs and tenements; and as we have enacted to them from the <HI>commune concilium</HI> of our &endq;whole kingdom afore&s;aid, and have given and granted to them in fee, and in hereditary right.</Q> In this law is pointed out the &s;ervice required, and to a&s;certain the hereditary rights of all the tenants, Saxons as well as Normans.&mdash;LL. Angl. Sax. ap. Wilkins.&mdash;Wright on Tenures, p. 72.&mdash;Sullivan, 267.</P>
<P>From this time all lands in England were de&s;cribed, "to be held of the king." Eccle&s;ia&s;tical corpora|tions, under the de&s;cription of <HI>liberi homines,</HI> according to their wealth, were obliged to find <HI>one or more knights or hor&s;emen;</HI> if as many as a baron, they were thereby barons, and intitled to &s;it in the <HI>commune concilium.</HI></P></NOTE>. This was not the only per&s;ecution the church &s;uffered; for the king, pretending he had information that the trea&s;ures of the rebels were concealed in the religious hou&s;es, he ordered the northern churches to be ran&s;acked, and even &s;pared not the ornaments of the &s;hrines, and the &s;acred ve&s;&s;els of the altars. He had not peace of mind with the clergy, who&s;e greatne&s;s he wanted much to reduce. For this purpo&s;e he applied to Rome, praying that two legates might be &s;ent into England, to enquire into the abu&s;es of the church; by who&s;e aid he di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and &s;ome others of the fir&s;t prelates in the kingdom. Tho&s;e whom the king di&s;liked, and could not be impeached by any legatory authority of his own, he impri&s;oned
<PB N="110" REF="155">them, and placed foreigners in the vacant Sees. He al&s;o carried a like exerci&s;e into the mona&s;teries. The&s;e acts of oppre&s;&s;ion alarmed the whole &s;tate; and, as the effect of de&s;pair it&s;elf, the people ro&s;e in arms, heated by the exhortations and cries of the clergy, and headed by &s;everal abbots, and dignified eccle&s;ia&s;tics, de|termined to &s;hake off the bondage in which they were involved, or peri&s;h in the attempt. Edgar was called upon to take the conduct of the armaments, which &s;hewed them&s;elves in every quarter; and he was publicly proclaimed king where|ever his party prevailed. By the advice of Lanfranc, the new archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, the king de&s;ired a conference with the malcontents, where, in an in&s;i|nuating phra&s;e, and with all the flowers of flattery, of which, notwith&s;tanding his temper, he was ma&s;ter, having all the accompli&s;hments of hypocri&s;y, he en|deavoured to remove the people's apprehen&s;ions, promi&s;ing a redre&s;s of grievan|ces, and &s;wearing on the books of the Evangeli&s;ts, to re&s;tore and e&s;tabli&s;h the ancient laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. His adver&s;aries, thus deluded and appea|&s;ed, retired, and di&s;banded their troops. As &s;oon as the pacification gave the king a &s;afe opportunity, he ordered &s;ome of the chiefs in the late in&s;urrection to be apprehended, &s;everal he put to death, and others he bani&s;hed or impri&s;oned. Edgar again e&s;caped into Scotland. The abbot of St Alban's, one of the mo&s;t zealous of the revolters, died in his place of concealment in the I&s;le of Ely, on which event the king plundered the mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everities induced Egelwin to determine on an abdication of his bi&s;hopric, and to &s;eek for peace and &s;afety in a foreign country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Symeon, p. 192.&mdash;Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 378, 379.</NOTE>. To this end he collect|ed a con&s;iderable trea&s;ure from the coffers of the See, and, in the 15th year of his epi&s;copacy, retired &s;ecretly from Durham, and took &s;hipping for Cologne; but, by adver&s;e winds, he was driven into Scotland, where he wintered. Whil&s;t in that retreat, he engaged him&s;elf to a powerful party, and privily got into the I&s;le of Ely, where there was a mona&s;tery, who&s;e abbot he conceived was his &s;in|cere friend. This place being entrenched by nature with a deep mora&s;s, was looked upon as an inacce&s;&s;ible retreat, when defended by a &s;ufficient number of troops. Edwin and Morcar<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden.&mdash;Lel. Col. v. iii. p. 126, 128.</NOTE>, having received intimation that the king had determined their fate<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 203.&mdash;Malm&s;. p. 104.&mdash;Iugulph.</NOTE>, withdrew &s;ecretly from court, and joined the party in Ely. Edwin, attempting to go into Scotland, was murdered on the road by the treachery of his attendants, who were &s;educed by &s;ome Normans to di&s;cover who he was. Tho&s;e who were now collected in the i&s;le making a powerful body, de|termined to de&s;end them&s;elves in that &s;tation to the la&s;t extremity, and there wait for any favourable event which might be in the will of Providence. It &s;eems they had hopes of &s;uccour from Denmark; and the Saxon Annals declare, that Sweyn landed a number of troops, but having been permitted by the king to pil|lage and &s;weep away the riches of Peterborough mona&s;tery, they departed without a&s;&s;i&s;ting their deluded friends. The king made a complete circumvallation of troops, by which all relief was cut off from the confederates, and he advanced daily in his attack, by forming a bridge cro&s;s the mora&s;s, which was two miles in
<PB N="111" REF="156">breadth. Notwith&s;tanding all the king's military manoeuvres, the event was doubt|ful, till, by the treachery of the abbot, he was made ma&s;ter of the key of the i&s;le, and took a bloody vengeance on the malcontents. Morcar he ca&s;t into pri|&s;on, and bi&s;hop Egelwin was &s;ent to Abingdon, and there held in clo&s;e durance. Symeon &s;ays, he was frequently admoni&s;hed to re&s;tore to his church the valuable things he had taken from thence; to which he repeatedly on his oath affirmed, that he removed nothing but what was his right. But one day as he wa&s;hed his hands, there dropped from his right arm, an armilla, or bracelet, which &s;ufficient|ly proved his perjury. By the king's command he was ca&s;t into pri&s;on, where, with famine and a broken heart, he died a mi&s;erable death. Some authors al|ledge, he refu&s;ed to receive any &s;u&s;tenance; others, that it was refu&s;ed to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Saera.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Great incon&s;i&s;tency appears in the various incidents of this prelate's life, from whence it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to conceive his real character. Wharton, p. 703, calls him <HI>"Vir genero&s;i animi."</HI> He appears to have been &s;editious, and bu&s;y in &s;ecular affairs, and, at the heart, no great &s;tickler for religion.</P>
<P>At this period be it remarked, that no traces have yet appeared of palatine juri&s;diction in the bi&s;hops of this See, or any acts of civil juri&s;diction attending their holy office.</P>
<P>The See of Durham, it is &s;aid, continued vacant about a year; but whether that computation is made from Egelwin's abdication or death, is not noticed; neither is it known how long the bi&s;hop continued in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>This vacancy offers an opportunity of taking a &s;hort view of the &s;tate of litera|ture and religion in this province, at that period, and to notice &s;ome memorable events. Aldred, archbi&s;hop of York, had &s;ufficient virtue of mind to remon|&s;trate to the king on the oppre&s;&s;ions the people &s;uffered under his government, but did not live to receive the courte&s;y his &s;overeign had re&s;olved to &s;hew him on that occa&s;ion; and perhaps the good purpo&s;es to which the king was moved were lo&s;t to the public by the prelate's death, who langui&s;hed with grief for the mi&s;eries of his country.</P>
<P>Malm&s;bury &s;ays, that learning and religion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Malm&s;. $. ii$. fo. 57.</NOTE> were then little regarded; there was very little &s;cholar&s;hip even among the clergy. If they could read the church &s;ervice, they thought them&s;elves qualified for their function, and &s;eldom carried their education much higher. If any of them under&s;tood grammar, he was look|ed upon as a prodigy of knowledge. The monks for&s;ook the au&s;terities of their order, and became expen&s;ive and &s;umptuous in their diet and habit. The rich among the laity were abandoned to luxury and debauchery; they thought it a hard&s;hip to &s;ubmit to the old cu&s;toms of devotion, to appear in church at morning prayer, but had matins performed in their bedchambers whil&s;t they were &s;till at repo&s;e. The poor were generally made a prey to the wealthy, who treated them without humanity, and as if they were by nature of an inferior creation: They were frequently plundered of their little effects, and &s;old for &s;laves to foreign na|tions. Ju&s;tice, temperance, and religion, were rare qualities in this aera.</P>
<PB N="112" REF="157">
<P>About this period the Synod was held at Winche&s;ter, in which it was decreed, that no canon of the church &s;hould be married. Tho&s;e prie&s;ts who had cures in the country, and were married, were not enjoined to part with their wives; but the bi&s;hops were directed, upon ordination, to exact, from prie&s;ts or deacons, a vow of celibacy to the following purport: <HI>Ego frater</HI> A <HI>promitto Deo omnibu&s;que &s;anctis ejus, ca&s;titatem corporis mei, &s;ecundum canonum decreta, et &s;ecundum ordinem mihi imponendum &s;ervare Domino.

<P>The injuries and in&s;ults the king had &s;u&s;tained from the Scotti&s;h king, could not be brooked by his impetuous and haughty temper: Therefore, as &s;oon as the confederates in Ely were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, he marched northward with a powerful armament, and penetrated into Galloway. He had a fleet at &s;ea attending his progre&s;s, keeping clo&s;e upon the coa&s;t as he advanced<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 381.</NOTE>. Malcolm, on the approach of the Engli&s;h army, retreated from the borders, not being willing to hazard an engagement. He kept at a &s;afe di&s;tance, well knowing the enemy could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t long in the country, and hoping a diver&s;ion would be made in England, which might afford a fortunate moment for &s;triking &s;ome blow. The king of Eng|land had too much penetration not to di&s;cover &s;o obvious a project; and there|fore made no lingering, but pre&s;&s;ed forward into the heart of the country. This progre&s;s had its de&s;ired effect with the Engli&s;h &s;overeign, for it obliged Malcolm to propo&s;e terms of accommodation. The counties of We&s;tmorland and Cum|berland, which for &s;everal reigns had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as fiefs of Scotland, were guaranteed to Malcolm and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and he did homage for the &s;ame. Ac|cording to Hector Boethius, the limits were a&s;certained by a cro&s;s erected on the heights of the de&s;ert of Stanmore, the remains of which are yet to be &s;een in the mid&s;t of a large entrenchment, and called Roy Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>On the king's return from this expedition, having previou&s;ly entertained &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t earl Go&s;patric, he deprived him of his government, under pre|tence of information that he was acce&s;ary to the death of Cumin, and an abettor in the &s;laughter of the Norman garri&s;on at York. The earl had received intima|tion of the king's wrath, and knowing him to be implacable, after he had recei|ved a prejudicial impre&s;&s;ion again&s;t any man, fled into Scotland, and, after a &s;hort &s;tay, pa&s;&s;ed over into Flanders, Malcolm perhaps fearing to entertain him in his territories &s;o &s;oon after a peace concluded with England. But he afterwards re|turned to Scotland, and then Malcolm gave him Dunbar, with the adjacent lands in Lothian, for the &s;upport of him&s;elf and hou&s;ehold, until better times. He died, and was interred at Norham<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

<P>In the king's return from his Scotti&s;h expedition, it is probable the &s;ucceeding bi&s;hop was elected to this See, at the king's nomination. Symeon &s;peaks of a de|&s;ign to impo&s;e a tax on the church-lands; but the officer of the king's revenue, &s;ent to Durham for that purpo&s;e, had a vi&s;ion, by which he was deterred making any levies on the lands of St Cuthbert<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 195, 196.</NOTE>; and the liberties and privileges of the church were afterwards confirmed, &s;ubject to the Norman feudal tenures.</P>
<P>WALCHER<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 331.</NOTE>, who &s;ucceeded to the See, was of noble birth in Lorrain, and had received an ex|cellent education at Liege, from whence he was invited over by the king, to take upon him this epi&s;copacy. His conduct was virtuous and amiable, and his reli|gious principles in high e&s;teem. With this elevated character he came over to England, in the &s;pring of the year 1072, being of the order of &s;ecular clergy, and was con&s;ecrated at Winche&s;ter<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sym.

<P>The king, whil&s;t on his northern expedition, ob&s;erved how proper a &s;ituation Durham was by nature for being made a barrier again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Scots, as al&s;o to keep in awe the inhabitants of Northumberland; the country north of Tyne, at that time, as it was during the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Danes, having become the common receptacle of all the abandoned and di&s;&s;olute wretches of the land, and the followers of tho&s;e who were di&s;contented with government, and ready on every occa&s;ion to take up arms, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e impious gains which were to be reaped in the times of public confu&s;ion and civil war. He therefore ordered a ca&s;tle to be built at Durham, at once to &s;ecure his earl of that pro|vince from tumults and in&s;urrections, as al&s;o to protect the bi&s;hop of the See and his church. Whether there was any fortre&s;s before that time on the eminence where the pre&s;ent ca&s;tle &s;tands, is uncertain; but the mount on which the chief tower is erected, appears to be of great antiquity; though Huntingdon's phra&s;e touching the king's erecting a ca&s;tle there, <HI>"de novo,"</HI> di&s;courages the idea; and yet it is not unfair to venture &s;uch a conjecture, from the circumvallations around the mount, the well-known mode of the Saxons. But be this as it may, it is not to be doubted, from the concurrence of the hi&s;torians, that the king erected a fortre&s;s in this place; though the remains of an edifice of that date, or of the Norman mode of architecture, are not now to be traced<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>Symeon writes, that the king, whil&s;t he abode in Durham, entertaining a doubt of the incorruptible &s;tate of St Cuthbert's body, inquired diligently concerning it; and, notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;everations of &s;everal of the mo&s;t pious and venerable men there, he &s;til pretended to di&s;believe it, and in&s;i&s;ted on having an in&s;pection of the &s;epulchre him&s;elf. Several bi&s;hops and abbots then pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ented to his will, and thought it proper the king's plea&s;ure &s;hould be complied with. Whether provoked by the delay, or his &s;u&s;picion of fraud was increa&s;ed by the reluctance of the eccle&s;ia&s;ties to comply with his de&s;ire, is not pointed out; but the king &s;o lemn|ly
<PB N="114" REF="159">wowed, if he was deceived in the relations he had heard, if the incorruptibility of the Saint's remains was merely a tale to work upon the &s;uper&s;tition of the vul|gar, and the body was not found in the &s;tate repre&s;ented to him, he would put to death all tho&s;e of &s;uperior rank throughout the city, who had pre&s;umed to impo&s;e on him. A terror fell on &s;uch as heard his menaces, and they devoutly implored the mercy of God, through the merits of the ble&s;&s;ed St Cuthbert, whil&s;t the bi&s;hop, with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity, performed the &s;ervice of high ma&s;s. The king, de|termined to &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity, immediately after the ceremony, commanded the officers of the church to open the &s;epulchre; and, whil&s;t he &s;tood by, he found him&s;elf &s;mitten on a &s;udden with a burning fever, which di&s;tracted him, in an into|lerable manner. Seized with &s;uch angui&s;h and di&s;ea&s;e, he ru&s;hed out of the church, leaving unta&s;ted a &s;umptuous banquet, which the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had prepared for him; and in&s;tantly mounting his hor&s;e, he fled from the city with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te, never abating the &s;peed of his cour&s;er, till he arrived on the banks of the Tees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym.

An in|dication of God's di&s;plea&s;ure, like this, at an attempt to di&s;turb the &s;acred remains, overawed the people, and contributed greatly to the veneration paid at the Saint's &s;hrine. Tradition &s;ays, the king, for ha&s;te, took his way down the narrow &s;treet called King's-gate, leading into the Bailey. The modern name of this &s;treet is Dun-cow-lane, from the &s;culpture of the memorable cow, on an oppo&s;ite tower of the church.</P>
<P>Soon after our bi&s;hop was &s;ettled in his See, one Aldwin a monk of great piety, who had been prior in the mona&s;tery of Wincelcomb, zealous to live in &s;tricter rules than tho&s;e his convent had adopted, and take upon him greater au&s;terities and &s;elf-denial, entertained a de&s;ire to vi&s;it Northumberland, where, in the early ages of the church, &s;o many holy men had lived, and there to obtain &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered &s;itua|tion for his future re&s;idence. On his journey he gained two a&s;&s;ociates, Elfwy and Renfrid, who travelled on foot with him to the north, by turns carrying the nece&s;|&s;ary books and ve&s;tments for celebrating divine &s;ervice. At fir&s;t they took up their re&s;idence at Munkche&s;ter, now Newca&s;tle; but their arrival being made known to the bi&s;hop, he &s;ent them an invitation to &s;ettle within his territories; as he thought it preferable for them to be under the government of an eccle&s;ia&s;tic than of the civil power. Munkche&s;ter, though in the bi&s;hop's See, was under the government of the earl of Northumberland. He received them with much honour, and rejoiced that Providence had &s;ent men of their order to abide in the province. He gave them for their re&s;idence the mona&s;tery dedicated to St Paul the apo&s;tle, formerly founded by Benedict at Gyrvum, now Jarrow. The walls were &s;tanding uncover|ed, and &s;carce any thing remained of its ancient greatne&s;s. With all po&s;&s;ible ex|pedition a roof was formed with wood, thatched with &s;traw, and, in a &s;hort time, divine &s;ervices were renewed. They made a loft for their lodgings, and the nece&s;|&s;ary occupations of hou&s;ehold, and were &s;u&s;tained by alms. They were join|ed by &s;everal brethren from the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom, but &s;ew from the $o$th, and &s;peedily the mona&s;tery became numerous. As they increa&s;ed in &s;trength,
<PB N="115" REF="160">having a de&s;ire to rebuild the church, and re&s;tore the ruined mona&s;tery, the bi&s;hop granted them the vill of Jarrow, with its appendages, viz.

Elfwy, alone, of the fir&s;t Benedictine &s;ettlers, remained at Jarrow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 203.</NOTE>. Aldwin &s;uffered much per&s;ecution from Malcolm king of Scotland, becau&s;e he and his brethren, for con&s;cience &s;ake, refu&s;ed &s;wearing alle|giance. Bi&s;hop Walcher, after many letters and me&s;&s;engers intreating their re|turn in vain, at length threatened them with excommunication if they di&s;obeyed his injunctions; in terror of which they returned to the See of Durham, and the bi&s;hop gave them for their place of re&s;idence the mona&s;tery of St Peter the A|po&s;tle at Weremouth; a &s;eat de&s;cribed by Bede as being once both ample and noble, though then a melancholy &s;cene of ruins. The monks having erected a habitation of wood and boughs of trees, took up their re&s;idence there; and it was in this place that Symeon took on him the habit of a monk. The bi&s;hop gave to this religious &s;ociety the vill of Weremouth, to which his &s;ucce&s;&s;or after|wards added Suddick. The naked walls of the church, which it does not appear were done any thing at from the time of the deva&s;tation by the Scots, were grown up with brambles and thorns. Tho&s;e being rooted out, the building repaired, and a roof made, divine &s;ervices were in a little time re&s;tored. From the time the Pagans in their de&s;cent on the coa&s;t de&s;troyed the churches and mona&s;teries of Northumberland, to the third year of bi&s;hop Walcher's epi&s;copacy, when Aldwin began to revive this hou&s;e in 1075, was a period of 205 years, Symeon &s;ays, 208. Such was our bi&s;hop's veneration for the order of monks, and for the dignity of religion; &s;uch his di&s;like to having the &s;olemn offices of his epi&s;copal church performed by &s;ecular clergy, that he formed a re&s;olution of taking on him that order, di&s;placing the &s;eculars, and bringing monks to the church at Durham.

<P>But to return to the events of the &s;tate. The king's pro&s;perity and greatne&s;s excited the malignity even of the Norman chieftains: As is u&s;ual with u&s;urpers, the exertions of power, for his own pre&s;ervation, were arbitrary and &s;evere. His countrymen were aggrandi&s;ed by the de&s;truction of tho&s;e Engli&s;h nobles who&s;e
<PB N="116" REF="161">lives and actions were a con&s;tant &s;tigma to the tyrant's multiplied acts of violence, and their wretchedne&s;s pierced the hearts of many, even of tho&s;e who flouri&s;hed on their ruin. No rewards can lull the con&s;cious heart from reflection, or great|ne&s;s pervert the &s;oul to prai&s;e the evil deeds of a tyrant; not even tho&s;e by which that greatne&s;s exi&s;ts. The rigour which the Normans experienced, together with the general affliction of the old inhabitants, urged many to enter into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the king, whil&s;t he was ab&s;ent in Normandy. Waltheof, though he had received &s;uch bounties from his &s;overeign, was a party in this confederacy, and vowed his &s;ecret aid and council &s;hould attend their projects, though he declined being active in the intended in&s;urrection, as well on account of his obligation to the king, as for fear of a di&s;covery by his lady, who was &s;o near in blood to him. But the earl's con&s;cience would not, on reflection, &s;uffer him to proceed in a plot at once &s;o full of villainy and ingratitude; he di&s;covered the con&s;piracy to Lan|franc archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and to Judith his counte&s;s, who prevailed on him to go &s;ecretly into Normandy, and reveal the whole to the king. The con|&s;pirators had engaged &s;uccours of men and arms from the Danes; but, fearful of the di&s;covery of their plot by earl Waltheof, in whom they had no great con|fidence, they began their in&s;urrection before the project was well ripened, or the Dani&s;h fleet arrived. Tho&s;e circum&s;tances contributed to the ea&s;y &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion, by means of the king's faithful friends at home, and his &s;peedy re|turn. Many of the chiefs were publicly executed, others mutilated, and deprived of their eyes. The king's prejudices were &s;o implacable, that he never could pardon one in his heart who had offended him; and earl Waltheof, notwith&s;tand|ing he received the fulle&s;t a&s;&s;urances of his maje&s;ty's affection, and of re&s;toration to his good e&s;teem, whil&s;t in Normandy, yet a jealou&s;y was implanted in his bo|&s;om, which no contrition could remove, or good offices eradicate, and which in the end brought on the earl's ruin. It is &s;aid the accu&s;ations of his counte&s;s bore hard upon his fidelity in the la&s;t tran&s;action. He was condemned to die; and, after &s;everal months impri&s;onment, was beheaded 29th April 1075, on a hill near Winche&s;ter. He was the la&s;t Engli&s;hman, after the reduction of this country by the Normans, who retained any con&s;iderable power or intere&s;t in the nation. His riches are &s;aid to have been the king's chief object in this execution.

<P>On the death of Waltheof, authors agree the bi&s;hop purcha&s;ed of the king the earldom of Northumberland. This is the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the civil power being united in one per&s;on, with the eccle&s;ia&s;tic, in this See. The king had created a palatine earldom in Che&s;ter, but no record &s;hews a like creation in this province; though it is highly probable our bi&s;hop had a palatine juri&s;diction granted to him, within the territories of St Cuthbert: And in order that the civil magi&s;tracy might not be attended with di&s;putes and wranglings, touching the limits and extent of juri&s;diction, with any earl appointed to Northumberland (as St Cuthbert's lands lay &s;traggling in that di&s;trict, &s;ave only tho&s;e within the confines of Tyne and Tees), it is probable that his obtaining the earldom was for the purpo&s;e of a more impartial and regular di&s;pen&s;ation of ju&s;tice throughout the whole province. But, to form &s;ome judgment of the nature of this civil juri&s;diction, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to attend to what has been &s;aid by the be&s;t authors on the palatine power, the acts of &s;ucceeding bi&s;hops, in the fulle&s;t manner exemplifying the extent of their au|thority.</P>

And for tho&s;e te&s;timonies before brought, that may &s;eem to per&s;wade the contrary, that Walcher bi&s;hop of Durham, if he was earl of Northumberland, was &s;heriff al|&s;o.

This twofold capacity the other bi&s;hops of England had, as well as Durham; they had a &s;piritual office, to wit, a bi&s;hopric, and a &s;ecular dignity, to wit, a barony. The archbi&s;hop of York &s;eems to make little or no difference between the bi&s;hop of Durham, and the other bi&s;hops, in re&s;pect of the pala|tine capacity of the former, and the baronial capacity of the latter; as if men had not at that time in Eng|land, a di&s;tinct notion of the title of a palatine.&mdash;Bar.

Speaking of the Franks, from whom many cu&s;toms are derived, Sullivan &s;ays,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sullivan's Lectures, p. 51.</NOTE>, <Q>But as it was un&s;afe to &startq;tru&s;t the government of tho&s;e new &s;ubjects in the hands of one of their nation, the king appointed annually one of his companions, or <HI>comes,</HI> for that purpo&s;e,
<PB N="125" REF="170">in a certain di&s;trict; and this was the origin of counties and counts. The bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the&s;e lords was to take care of, and account for the profits of the king's deme&s;nes, to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice, and account for the profits of the courts, which were very con&s;iderable, as the Roman laws about crimes being by degrees &s;uper|&s;eded, and con&s;equently capital puni&s;hment in mo&s;t ca&s;es aboli&s;hed, all offences became fineable, a third of which they retained to them&s;elves. They al&s;o, in &endq;imitation of the lords of the Franks, led their followers to the wars.</Q></P>
<P>As to the offices of earls and counts palatine, he &s;peaks thus: <Q>The office of &startq;the&s;e counts was threefold; to judge the freemen in peace, to conduct them in war, to manage the king's deme&s;nes in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, and to account with him for them and the profits of his courts of ju&s;tice, which were very con&s;iderable, when all offences were puni&s;hed by fines. Their fir&s;t con&s;titution mu&s;t be referred to the time of the divi&s;ion of England into counties, to which they had a reference, which is generally a&s;cribed to Alfred. Their power and office was exactly the &s;ame with the counts on the continent in tho&s;e early times, namely, to judge and lead the free men to war; for the greate&s;t part of the lands of England were at that time allodial (paying neither fines or rendering &s;er|vices), as is proved by Spelman, contrary to the opinion of Sir Edward Coke; although with him it mu&s;t be allowed, that there were fiefs al&s;o before the con|que&s;t, and that they were not all introduced at that period. But William hav|ing turned all the lands into feudal, was obliged to put his earls on the &s;ame footing that tho&s;e on the continent were in his time, and con&s;equently to make them hereditary. But, to prevent the too great influence which their judging in per&s;on might acquire to them in their di&s;tricts, officers cho&s;en by the people, and approved by the king, were &s;ub&s;tituted to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice, under the names of <HI>vice-comites,</HI> or &s;heriffs: The&s;e were to pay to the king two-thirds, and to the earl his third, of the profits, which was in tho&s;e times look|ed upon as &s;o incident to an earldom as to pa&s;s with it, although expre&s;s words were wanting; &s;o that, in tho&s;e times, an earl and a county were co-relatives." The effect of the creation of counties palatine, was to have <HI>jura regalia;</HI> for the earl-palatine might pardon trea&s;on, murder, and other offences; might make ju&s;tices of a&s;&s;ize, gaol delivery, and of the peace; might create barons of his county-palatine, and confer knight-hood. They had likewi&s;e all forfei|tures that aro&s;e by the common-law, or by any prior &s;tatute; but forfeitures ari&s;ing from &s;tatute made after the erection of the county-palatine, belonged to the king. They had courts as the king had at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and out of their chancery i&s;&s;ued all writs, original and judicial. Neither did the king's writ run within the county-palatine, except writs of error, which are in the nature of appeals; or in ca&s;es where otherwi&s;e there would be a failure of ju&s;tice. All manner of indictments and proce&s;&s;es were made in their name, and every tre&s;|pa&s;s was laid to be done again&s;t the peace of him that had the county-pala|tine. But the&s;e, and &s;ome other privileges, have been taken away, and an|nexed to the crown, in who&s;e name they mu&s;t now be; but the te&s;te of the &endq;writs is &s;till in the name of the earl-palatine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sullivan, lect. xxi. p. 197, &amp;c.&mdash;Baron.

<P>But enough has been &s;aid for the reader to form a judgment of the origin and nature of the palatine power here; whether it exi&s;ted before the Norman acce&s;|&s;ion, or was created by K. Wil. I. whether it is a per&s;onal or local authority, and what was its latitude and juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>To return to our bi&s;hop, who was not happy in having united the temporal duties with the &s;piritual. It has been noticed, that the di&s;&s;atisfied temper of the Northumbrians under the Norman acce&s;&s;ion, and their habitual di&s;po&s;ition, did not promi&s;e a &s;peedy &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to new authorities. They regarded the bi&s;hop, from his civil capacity, in a light they had never &s;een any of St Cuthbert's &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors; and from their hatred to one of his characters, lo&s;t their reverence for the other. The veneration in which the people were accu&s;tomed to hold their bi&s;hop, was dreadfully &s;haken when they &s;aw the holy prelate taking on him the exerci&s;e of legal &s;everities, and enforcing the laws of the u&s;urper, who&s;e name, character, and cruelties, they held in the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation. Some of the mona&s;tic writers charge the bi&s;hop with a perver&s;ion of ju&s;tice, not determining cau&s;es which came before him according to their merits, but to gratify &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es, by which he and his officers accumulated much wealth from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ub|ject;
<PB N="129" REF="174">whereby the popular odium was encrea&s;ed again&s;t him to &s;uch a degree of madne&s;s, as nothing but blood could &s;atiate *. Symeon endeavours to &s;creen his character, and lay an imputation on his mini&s;ters, as if he was not even acce&s;&s;ary by a privity to their crimes. He &s;ays, he was a man of moral life, and, for vir|tue and good manners, worthy the affection of the be&s;t of men. It is certain, from all authorities, he made a very improper choice of mini&s;ters and favourites. His kin&s;man, Gilbert, was entru&s;ted in the admini&s;tration of the earldom, and his chaplain, Leofwin, was his archdeacon in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, and chief con|fident in all private affairs. This author charges the latter with purloining much of the ornaments and trea&s;ures of the church, and di&s;tributing them among&s;t his kinsfolks. Of the former, he &s;ays his &s;oldiers treated the people with intole|rable in&s;olence, taking away by force whatever their wantonne&s;s of power dictated, and putting to death even tho&s;e of higher birth. A Saxon nobleman, who&s;e name was Liulph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 208.</NOTE>, eminent for his per&s;onal virtues, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and great al|liance (he having married Algitha, &s;i&s;ter of Elfleda, wife of earl Siward, and mo|ther of Waltheof), was in great favour with the bi&s;hop, being frequently one of his council, and at his table<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From whom the barons Lumley are de&s;cended.</NOTE>. When Gilbert afflicted the province by frequent rapine and oppre&s;&s;ion, it was conceived his evil actions were &s;upported by the connivance of the bi&s;hop. Amid&s;t the indi&s;criminate depredations of the deputy, Liulph's e&s;tates &s;uffered part of the marks of the &s;poiler's hand, on which he ap|plied to the bi&s;hop, with remon&s;trances again&s;t the improper conduct of his <HI>vice|comes</HI> and archdeacon<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 383.</NOTE>. The jealou&s;y and re&s;entment of the Norman favourites thenceforth were grievou&s;ly excited; and Leofwin thinking him&s;elf particularly affronted by Liulph's repeated charges to the bi&s;hop, &s;olicited Gilbert to put him to death. This, from an equal &s;pirit of re&s;entment, he readily undertook; and, be&s;etting his hou&s;e with troops in the night-time, put Liulph to the &s;word, with the greate&s;t part of his family. This act of violence encrea&s;ed the tumult of the Northumbrians, by whom Liulph was greatly revered and beloved, and they anxiou&s;ly waited a proper opportunity to revenge the horrid ma&s;&s;acre of this illu&s;|trious and innocent family. It was in vain for the bi&s;hop to attempt appea&s;ing the enflamed minds of the populace, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations of his inno|cence, and dete&s;tation of the crime. He did not bring the perpetrators to ju&s;tice, notwith&s;tanding the anger which he expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the offence, but, negligent of the rights of the injured, he &s;uffered the guilty per&s;ons &s;till to go at large, and ex|ecute the high offices they held; which appearances determined the judgment of the people, that the crimes were perpetrated by his connivance, and with his pri|vity It is probable he might not be anxious to relax any part of the &s;everities of his government, thinking he &s;hould thereby bring the Northumbrians earlier to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Not long after the foregoing tran&s;action, the bi&s;hop, in exerci&s;e of his civil juri&s;|diction, held a public a&s;&s;embly of his council and mini&s;ters at Gate&s;head, whither the &s;uitors repaired; and although the following cata&s;trophe, Symeon &s;ays, was
<PB N="130" REF="175">predicted to him by a man ri&s;en from the dead at Raven&s;worth, yet he went thither without a &s;ufficient military force to &s;ecure him from injury, depending on the ve|neration hitherto paid to the &s;acredne&s;s of his office<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">S$m. Dun. p. 209.</NOTE>. The appearance of the people immediately indicated their di&s;po&s;ition for mi&s;chief; they were not to be re|&s;trained, were in&s;olent and refractory. The bi&s;hop was at length alarmed for his &s;afety, when it was too late to procure &s;uccour. He cau&s;ed his officers to a&s;&s;ure the people, that part of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the a&s;&s;embly was to make re&s;titution to the relations of the decea&s;ed. The rage of the populace encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a height, that at length he offered to bring Leo&s;win to trial, that the law might determine his fate. But the mob were &s;o tumultuous and in&s;tamed, they refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the common forms of ju&s;tice. The bi&s;hop perceived it was too late to appea&s;e them; their ferocity of temper di&s;played a total contempt of his official authority as earl, or &s;anctity as bi&s;hop; they be&s;et the hou&s;e with a clamour which &s;truck the whole a&s;&s;embly with terror; and, on a watchword being pronounced from every quarter, which &s;ome of the mona&s;tic authors have recorded, <HI>Short red, good red, flea ye the bi&s;hoppe,</HI> they di&s;covered their arms, which hitherto were concealed under their garments. The few guards the bi&s;hop brought with him, dreading no mi&s;chief, on their arrival di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves, and were repo&s;ing here and there in a negligent manner; Such were &s;urrounded, and put to the &s;word. The bi&s;hop privately retreated to the church, whither he &s;ummoned a few of the chief men of each party, to propo&s;e terms of amity and &s;atisfaction. Tho&s;e who conceived they could influence the mob, went out to appea&s;e them, but, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, many were &s;lain. The bi&s;hop commanded Gilbert to go forth, and endeavour to reconcile their wrath, but he was an unmediate victim to their vengeance. Some of the rioters &s;et fire to the church, whil&s;t others guarded the door, and put every one to death that attempted to depart. Tho&s;e who re|mained within, no longer able to endure the force of the flames, ru&s;hed out, and were in&s;tantly &s;lain. The la&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly was the venerable prelate; his heart was overwhelmed with affliction for the death of his people: Whil&s;t his benevolence lamented their unhappy exit, he denied all the feelings his own approaching fate might have in&s;pired in a le&s;s generous bo&s;om; for he could not hope that his life would be &s;pared by the &s;avage and mad multitude. Between the impending evils, for a moment, he was indeterminate what death he &s;hould die. The fire urged him to the &s;word of the enemy; the enemy drove him back to the flames.

<P>This cata&s;trophe happened on the 14th day of May 1080, the bi&s;hop having held the See nine years and two months. The leader of the riot was E$dul&s;, &s;urnamed Rus, great-grand&s;on of earl Uchtred, and con&s;equently of a$linity with Liulph. It is &s;aid he killed the bi&s;hop with his own hand, and &s;oon afterwards died by the hands of a woman, and was buried at Jedword; from which place of &s;epulture his body was afterwards ca&s;t out by the command of Turgot, when prior $f Durham, and left to 10t upon the earth. It is mentioned, with &s;ome probabi|lity, that the &s;ecular clergy, fearful of being di&s;placed from the church at Durham, a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;pirit up the di&s;content of the people again&s;t our bi&s;hop's admini&s;tration, and not a little contributed to enflame them to their violent proceedings.</P>
<P>The death of the bi&s;hop being told to the monks of Jarrow, they took a boat and came to the place, where they found the remains of their prelate, &s;carce to be known from his wounds. They conveyed the body to their mona&s;tery, and from thence to Durham, where they gave it private &s;epulture in the chapter-hou&s;e. The rioters, after the&s;e execrable acts of violence, immediately repaired to Dur|ham, and be&s;et the ca&s;tle, where they met with a valiant re&s;i&s;tance.

<P>The king was highly provoked by the traiterous actions of the Northumbrians, and &s;ent down into the north his brother Odo, bi&s;hop of Baieux, with a large body of troops, to puni&s;h tho&s;e guilty of the outrage, and to take vengeance for the ma&s;&s;acre of the bi&s;hop and his people. Odo, Symeon &s;ays, <HI>tunc a rege &s;ecun|dus fuerat,</HI> was his chief ju&s;ticiary; and, having cro&s;&s;ed the Tyne, the chiefs of the offenders being fled at his approach, he wa&s;ted the country, put many to death, and mutilated others, who were of con&s;anguinity to the murderers, and could not pay the price &s;et on their heads; among&s;t whom many innocent wretches &s;uf|fered under the avenger's &s;word. According to Symeon's de&s;cription, he de&s;o|lated that part of the province &s;o as to reduce it to a dreary &s;olitude and de&s;ert. He reflects on the memory of Odo in this expedition, a&s;&s;erting, he took from the church, under a pretence of lodging it &s;afe in the ca&s;tle, one of its greate&s;t orna|ments, for admirable workman&s;hip and curious materials, being a pa&s;toral &s;taff, made of &s;apphire; which fraud was attempted to be covered by a report that it was &s;tolen by &s;ome of the &s;oldiers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

He gave a &s;ee<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ma$cam.</NOTE> of gold, and a precious robe to the &s;ervice of the church.

Bar. v. i.</NOTE>. On his declining the office, Robert de Moubraie, his nephew, was nominated thereto: But no author has pointed out the exact periods when the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ions took place.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year with our prior died king William the Fir&s;t. During the la&s;t &s;even years of his reign, the only matter met with in hi&s;tory concerning Northum|berland is, that, on an alarm given him of an intended inva&s;ion, which Canute king of Denmark was preparing, the king brought over from the continent a great army of foreign mercenaries, for the defence of his dominions here, of which &s;everal thou&s;ands were &s;tationed in Northumberland. After all that this mi&s;erable country had &s;uffered, tho&s;e &s;oldiers had orders to wa&s;te and plunder it, that the invaders might find no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence therein. The expedition this foreign power was preparing again&s;t England, was fru&s;trated by dome&s;tic troubles and ad|ver&s;e winds; &s;o that all but the devoted land of Northumberland e&s;caped the dread|ful effects of the war which was threatened.</P>
<P>Our bi&s;hop, on the acce&s;&s;ion of William Rufus, &s;till retained his office and ho|nours at court, and, by &s;ome authors, was &s;tiled prime mini&s;ter. A great de|fection appeared among the Norman barons, in the &s;pring &s;ucceeding the corona|tion, who declared for Robert, the late king's elde&s;t &s;on, and in&s;urrections were fomented in various parts of England. Odo bi&s;hop of Baieux, the king's uncle, was the chief of the malcontents; and, by his influence and oratory, drew many into his plot for placing Robert on the throne. But the king, by the attention and a&s;&s;iduity of Lanfranc archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, having been put in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the royal trea&s;ures, and conducted in various prudential mea&s;ures, &s;oon cru&s;hed the rebellion, which appeared &s;o formidable at its out&s;et. William bi&s;hop of Durham, and Moubraie earl of Northumberland, were among the in&s;urgents. The king, after prevailing again&s;t the &s;outhern powers, &s;ent an army into the north, which laid &s;iege to the Ca&s;tle of Durham, and &s;oon reduced it, obliging the bi&s;hop to fly into Normandy. Moubraie was with his uncle Geoffrey in the Ca&s;tle of Bri&s;tol, but it is uncertain what was his lot, on its &s;urrender.</P>
<P>The See, during the bi&s;hop's ab&s;ence, was governed by the prior of Durham; but the temporalities were &s;eized to the king's u&s;e. Ivo Tailbois, and Ernei&s;us
<PB N="137" REF="182">de Burone, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ca&s;tle of Durham, with the territories thereto belonging, on the 13th of December. The king not only &s;eized the lands between Tyne and Tees, but he &s;evered from the See Hoveden and Welton in York&s;hire, and gave them to Odon <HI>(Comes campaniae),</HI> and Alan earl of Richmond. The prior and convent were not mole&s;ted by the king's officers, but permitted to enjoy their property in peace. During this vacancy the monks built their refectory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 386.&mdash;Sym. Dun. p. 235.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The troubles in the &s;tate being now put an end to, the king, well knowing the indolence and mildne&s;s of his brother Robert's di&s;po&s;ition, formed a project to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of Normandy. In the execution of this &s;cheme, &s;ome of the king's troops were be&s;ieged in a fortre&s;s not capable of long re&s;i&s;tance, and were reduced to great extremities, when, by the interpo&s;ition of our bi&s;hop, the garri|&s;on was pre&s;erved from the &s;word. Soon afterwards a peace was concluded, and, for this meritorious &s;ervice, the bi&s;hop was received again into the royal fa|vour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 386.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before the king's return from Normandy, Malcolm of Scotland, expre&s;&s;ing a di&s;&s;atisfaction at his u&s;urpation, &s;eized the occa&s;ion of his ab&s;ence, and entering by Northumberland, invaded England. Moubraie earl of Northumberland, with other chiefs of the northern parts, rai&s;ing a powerful army, impeded his pro|gre&s;s, though he had time to &s;end off parties with great booty into Scotland. The king being informed of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, ha&s;tened to England, where he arrieved in the month of Augu&s;t; and &s;oon after moved with a large fleet and army to cha&s;ti&s;e the northern foe for this violence. The &s;ea&s;on was unpropitious to an at|tempt of this nature: A &s;torm happened a few days before Michaelmas, in which the fleet was almo&s;t totally wrecked; and the army, by the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on, and &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, &s;uffered very greatly. Yet notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e un|favourable circum&s;tances, a peace was negociated between the contending powers, and Malcolm did homage to the king, on having confirmed to his crown twelve towns in England, and an annual pen&s;ion of twelve marcs of gold, as it was &s;ettled in the preceding reign, on Cumberland being re&s;igned to the crown of Eng|land. It was on this expedition the king re&s;tored the bi&s;hop of Durham to his See, on the 11th day of September, A. D. 1091<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sym. Dun. p. 236.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year following, new di&s;turbances ari&s;ing between the two kingdoms, the king of Scotland again entered Northumberland, and wa&s;ted the whole di&s;trict as far as Alnwick, where he and his &s;on were &s;lain. Various accounts are given of this tragical blow; the mo&s;t probable attribute it to an ambu&s;cade formed by a detachment of Earl Moubraie's troops in garri&s;on at Bambrough<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See the accounts of this tran&s;action in the View of Northumberland.</NOTE>. This event produced great revolutions in the &s;tate of Scotland; and, in the end, the happy acce&s;&s;ion of Edgar, &s;on of king Malcolm Canmore, was the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop, in his exile, was not negligent of his epi&s;copal church; for, on his return, he pre&s;ented thereto, various &s;acred ve&s;&s;els, and other ornaments of gold and &s;ilver, together with a valuable collection of books.</P>

His munificene was unlimited; for, not content with giving the&s;e rich pre&s;ents and noble ornaments, he brought over from Normandy the plan of a new church, devi&s;ed in the &s;tile and magnificence u&s;ed on the continent; and, in the year 1093, he began the erection of the &s;tately edifice yet remaining at Dur|ham. The foundation was laid at the time Malcolm made his journey to the Eng|li&s;h court, previous to his la&s;t fatal expedition to Alnwick; as, in the offices of laying the fir&s;t &s;tones of this &s;acred edifice, Malcolm is named with the bi&s;hop, and Turgot the prior.

<P>During the time of tho&s;e great di&s;tractions in Scotland, occa&s;ioned by the death of Malcolm and his &s;on, earl Robert Moubraie incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of his &s;overeign, by a&s;&s;ociating with William D'Eu, and other Norman lords, in a con&s;piracy for depo&s;ing him, and advancing to the throne Stephen count of Aumale, or Albemarle, the &s;on of a &s;i&s;ter of K. Wil. I. The king, in|formed of the plot, &s;ummoned the earl to attend, at his peril, at the court, on the approaching fe&s;tival of Whit&s;untide; but, elated with his late atchievement at Alnwick<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hunting. p. 373.</NOTE>, he refu&s;ed to attend without ho&s;tages, and &s;afe conduct being granted to him by the crown. The king, enraged at this in&s;olence, marched northward with his army; and, after a &s;iege of two months, reduced the ca&s;tle of Tinemouth, where he took pri&s;oners the earl's brother and almo&s;t all his chief retainers. But advancing to Bambrough, where he held a &s;trong garri&s;on in
<PB N="139" REF="184">per&s;on, the king, on viewing the fortre&s;s, had the mortification to hear it pro|nounced, by his engineers, impregnable. The only manoeuvre he found expedient was to erect a fort, in the neighbourhood of the ca&s;tle, called a Malvoi&s;in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Engli&s;hed,</HI> An ill neighbour.</NOTE>, where a few troops could annoy the garri&s;on, by interrupting their &s;upplies of provi&s;ions, and cutting off their foraging parties. Leaving &s;ome tru&s;ty friends on this com|mand, he moved &s;outhward with the chief body of his army. The earl making an excur&s;ion at night with a &s;mall troop of hor&s;e, in hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing Newca&s;tle on Tyne, was pur&s;ued by part of the troops of Malvoi&s;in, and obliged to change his route to Tinmouth, where with a &s;mall party the &s;u&s;tained a &s;iege of &s;ix days. Hav|ing received a wound in his leg, which di&s;abled him from duty, and his attendants being di&s;pirited and unrelieved, they &s;urrendered the ca&s;tle, and were all made pri|&s;oners. The king directed, that the earl &s;hould be led before the walls of Bam|brough, which his wife, and Morael his lieutenant, &s;till held; that the garri&s;on be &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, or otherwi&s;e the earl's eyes in&s;tantly be put out, in their pre&s;ence. This menace had the de&s;ired effect; the place was delivered up to the king's troops, and Morael received his pardon; but the unhappy earl was commit|ted pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or, where he langui&s;hed thirty years, and died.&mdash; Thus ended the numerous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of viceroys and earls of Northumberland; the government of that province being, from thenceforth, in the hands of the crown, &s;ave only in tho&s;e in&s;tances of interruption hereafter to be pointed out<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>Two years after the changes in Northumberland, Edgar, the elde&s;t &s;urviving &s;on of Malcolm, was, by the aid of the king of England, re&s;tored to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his father's throne, without much blood&s;hed. This great event the monks of Dur|ham<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fordun, l. v. c. 30.</NOTE> a&s;cribed to the protection of their patron Saint. It &s;eems the bi&s;hop of Durham, on his a&s;&s;umption of palatine juri&s;diction, had di&s;played a military &s;tand|ard, &s;imilar to that u&s;ed by a &s;overeign prince, which was called the banner of St Cuthbert. In Edgar's expedition is the fir&s;t in&s;tance of its being named by hi&s;to|rians; for it is &s;aid, as Edgar was on his march towards Scotland, he had a vi&s;ion of the Saint, who promi&s;ed him the protection of Heaven, directing him to ob|tain his banner from the convent, and di&s;play it on his march at the head of his army, a&s;&s;uring him his enemies &s;hould &s;ly before him. The whole revelation was ob&s;erved, and the happy event &s;ucceeded. The king, in te&s;timony of his grati|tude, granted to the convent the place and lands of Coldingham, with &s;everal ad|jacent villages, who&s;e names, as mentioned in the grant, are known, with little variation of &s;pelling, to this day. The ancient abbey and mona&s;tery were re&s;tored; a colony of monks, &s;ome &s;hort time afterwards, was &s;ent from the church at Dur|ham; and the priory of Coldingham continued, for &s;everal ages, to depend there|on as a cell. Edgar a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on to dedicate the church to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; and, on that occa&s;ion, made to the church, and the monks of St Cuthbert, a gift of &s;ome additional lands in the Mer&s;e, called the lands of Swinton, as they had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Liulph, together with twenty-four bea&s;ts for tilling them anew. By two other charters he granted Paxton and Fi&s;hwic, with the lands lying between
<PB N="140" REF="185">Horndean and Knapdean. He ordained the like privilege of &s;anctuary to Col|dingham, being 37 days, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the churches of Holy I&s;land and Norham; and gave the annual pen&s;ion of half a mark of &s;ilver to the monks of Coldingham, from every plough in Coldingham&s;hire; to which tax the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the lands voluntarily &s;ubmitted, and engaged them&s;elves to the king for payment thereof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on's Dipl. pl. 6, 7.</NOTE>.

Thor's charters mention, that, with the aid of his prince king Edgar, he founded the church of Eadnaham, in honour of St Cuthbert; which church was always a member of the &s;pirituality of Coldingham. The &s;eals are curious. The prior of Coldingham was pre&s;ented by the convent of Durham, and was admitted to his &s;piritualities by the archbi&s;hop of St Andrew's, and to the temporalities by the king of Scotland.

Wharton &s;ays, his mind was enriched with the noble&s;t gifts of genius, erudition, eloquence, and wit; and, in the quickne&s;s of his parts through every department of his office, there was none &s;uperior to him. But this excellent picture is blotted by a charge<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eadmer.&mdash;Malm&s;. &amp;c.</NOTE> too well grounded; that, amid&s;t all tho&s;e valuable endowments of mind, he was de|&s;titute of integrity and fidelity, and had no bounds to his ambition; for though his gratitude &s;hould have held him fa&s;t to his &s;overeign, he forgot all his royal bounties, and joined with the rebel Odo, and his confederates<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 704.</NOTE>. He is al&s;o &s;tig|matized with having abu&s;ed the intere&s;t he obtained, by the ba&s;e&s;t means, in the heart of K. Wil.

No one exceeded him in propriety of manners. His per|ception and judgment were &s;o quick, that he in&s;tantly formed the ju&s;te&s;t determi|nations on events of the greate&s;t moment. He graced the endowments of wi&s;dom with the fine&s;t eloquence. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t retentive memory, and his whole character was &s;o elevated as to claim the attention and favour, not only of his own &s;overeigns, but al&s;o of the king of France and the bi&s;hop of Rome. He was a man of &s;trict &s;obriety and temperance, plain and moderate in his apparel, zealous in the catholic faith, and of &s;ingular cha&s;tity. Whil&s;t he attended the courts of princes, he was always attentive to, and a &s;trenuous maintainer of the rights and liberties of his mona&s;tery and church<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sym.

<P>To tho&s;e we mu&s;t add truths un&s;ullied by his errors; that he had a mo&s;t munifi|cent heart; his works of piety were truly great; his charity unbounded, and his liberality towards his brethren mo&s;t exalted.

He was endowed with great &s;ubtilty of genius, ready wit, and
<PB N="144" REF="189">eloquence, by which qualifications he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the good graces of his &s;overeign, to whom he became a very u&s;eful per&s;on, in devi&s;ing the exactions and taxes which he extorted from his people; and, in the end, po&s;&s;e&s;ed the highe&s;t influence at court. Godwin charges him with much depravity of prin|ciples: <HI>Hone&s;tatem exutilitate mutire.</HI> He was &s;urveyor of the king's homagers; then chief ju&s;ticiary, which, by the writers of that time, is de&s;cribed as an office &s;uperior, in tru&s;t and dignity, to trea&s;urer and chancellor; and at la&s;t he was ap|pointed procurator-general; under which employments he conducted him&s;elf &s;o oppre&s;&s;ively, and with &s;uch inju&s;tice, that he incurred a general odium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chron.

<P>The iniquitous practice of &s;eizing the temporalities of bi&s;hoprics, was fir&s;t be|gun by this king, at Flambard's in&s;tigation, as Odericus Vitalis &s;ays. Before the Norman inva&s;ion, the cu&s;tom in England was, that, upon the death of an abbot, the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e took care of the revenues of &s;uch abbot; and, upon the death of a bi&s;hop, the archbi&s;hop took care of the revenues of &s;uch bi&s;hop, till the vacancy was filled again. But this cu&s;tom William Rufus aboli&s;hed, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of our prelate; kept the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury void three years, and put the money ari&s;ing therefrom into his own coffers.</P>
<P>The continuator of Symeon's hi&s;tory gives us a long relation of the plot that was formed to take away the bi&s;hop's life, but proved abortive<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Continuation Sym. Dun. p. 249.&mdash;Angl. Sac. p. 705.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Flambard was con&s;ecrated in St Paul's, London, by Thomas archbi&s;hop of York, on the 5th day of June, in the year 1099, the &s;ame continuator &s;ays, without any profe&s;&s;ion of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the archiepi&s;copal juri&s;diction being ex|acted, which was &s;ubmitted to by his predece&s;&s;or: But this is denied by other writers. He had not enjoyed his epi&s;copal function above fifteen months before the king came to his death in the New Fore&s;t, as he was hunting the &s;tag, being &s;hot through the heart with an arrow by Tyrrel, a French knight, who was much &s;u&s;pected of de&s;ign. His character is comprehended in few words. Rapin &s;ays, he had all the vices of his father, without his virtues. He was neither religious, cha&s;te, or temperate. He was profu&s;e and profligate; and one in&s;tance of his ir|religion, given by Eadmer, may &s;uffice. Fifty Engli&s;h gentlemen having &s;afely pa&s;&s;ed the fiery ordeal, on an accu&s;ation of <HI>hunting,</HI> he &s;wore by St Luke's face, his u&s;ual oath, that he could never believe God was a ju&s;t judge, &s;ince he pro|tected &s;uch offenders.</P>
<P>Malm&s;bury gives us a melancholy picture of the &s;tate of human life in this aera: The minds of men were froward, and inclined to quarrels and warfare; they were overwhelmed in exce&s;s and &s;en&s;uality, from which even the clergy were not exempt. Vanity, lu&s;t, and intemperance, reigned every where. Eadmer &s;ays, the men appeared &s;o effeminate in their dre&s;s and conver&s;ation, that they di&s;|tingui&s;hed their &s;ex in nothing but their daily attempts on female cha&s;tity. Even the king's &s;ervants, following him in his journies, u&s;ed to harra&s;s and plunder the country as their wickedne&s;s in&s;tigated; and many of them were &s;o extravagant in their barbarity, that what they could not eat or drink in their quarters, they either
<PB N="145" REF="190">obliged the people to carry to market, and &s;eil for their emolument, or they threw it into the fire. At their departure, they frequently wa&s;hed their hor&s;es heels with the wine left undrunk, or wa&s;ted it on the ground. As for out|rages committed on the per&s;ons of the &s;ubjects, both men and women, they went to the utmo&s;t lengths of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and cruelty. For the&s;e rea&s;ons the ap|proach of the court was dreaded no le&s;s than an inva&s;ion: when they heard the king was coming, every body quitted their hou&s;es, and fled with their effects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, p. 295.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Henry, the king's younger brother, &s;ucceeded to the throne. On his acce&s;|&s;ion he promi&s;ed to abrogate all oppre&s;&s;ive laws made &s;ince the coming in of his father; to re&s;tore the government to the Saxon &s;y&s;tem; to aboli&s;h unju&s;t and ar|bitrary taxes, and rein&s;tate the clergy in their privileges. He was made king by the cry of the populace again&s;t the judgment of the nobles, who alone, to pre|vent the horrors of a civil war, Robert his elde&s;t brother being ab&s;ent, &s;ubmitted to his being proclaimed. The fir&s;t &s;tep he took in pur&s;uance of his promi&s;e was to correct the enormities committed by his officers and &s;ervants, and to puni&s;h the mo&s;t notorious with death. Our bi&s;hop, the dete&s;ted mini&s;ter of the late king, was, by the advice of the great council of the kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 47.&mdash;Sax. Ann.</NOTE>, on the 14th Sep|tember A. D. 1100, committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the Tower of London.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e acts were &s;ucceeded by the king's aboli&s;hing the curfew or couvre-feu<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See page 102 of this work.</NOTE>, and by charter con&s;irming the privileges of the people as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Saxons, renouncing the royal prerogatives his father and brother had u&s;urped. By this charter the liberties of the church were re&s;tored: The heirs of earls and barons were admitted to their e&s;tates without compo&s;ition or redemption, on paying a re|lief; and va&s;&s;als were entitled to the &s;ame privilege with their re&s;pective lords. He gave liberty to the nobles to marry without the royal licence, provided it was not to the enemies of the &s;tate. He appointed that mothers, and neare&s;t relations, &s;hould be guardians to minors; and e&s;tabli&s;hed a general &s;tandard for weights and mea&s;ures. Coiners he ordered to be puni&s;hed with lo&s;s of limb.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop, about the fourth of February, A. D. 1101, effected his e&s;cape from pri&s;on, and fled into Normandy. The manner of his e&s;cape is related by Oderi|cus Vitalis<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Eccl. p. 787.</NOTE>, who &s;hortly gives his hi&s;tory to this effect: <Q>That though of mean &startq;extraction, he gained &s;o far on his &s;overeign's good opinion, by aiding his wic|ked machinations, that he advanced him to the highe&s;t offices of the crown, and, though an illiterate per&s;on, he gave him the bi&s;hopric of Durham. Af|ter K. Wil. II. 's death, he was committed pri&s;oner to the Tower of London, under the cu&s;tody of William de Magnaville; but, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends, he made his e&s;cape. By his &s;acetious humour and wit, he gained the confidence and e&s;teem of tho&s;e who had the cu&s;tody of his per&s;on. With the king's allowance of two &s;hillings a-day, he lived in a &s;plendid and convivial manner with tho&s;e about him. One day having drank deeply, tho&s;e who at|tended
<PB N="146" REF="191">him being full of wine, he fa&s;tened a rope to the pillar in the center of his window, and taking with him his pa&s;toral &s;taff, he de&s;cended to his friends, who waited for him at the foot of the Tower, his hands, for want of gloves, being excoriated to the bone by the pa&s;&s;ing of the cord. Hor&s;es being ready for him, he fled with all &s;peed, with a few faithful followers. His &s;teward met him upon the road with his trea&s;ure; and, immediately taking &s;hipping, he ar|rived &s;afe in Normandy, where he met with a cordial reception from Duke Ro|bert, who immediately put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the vacant bi&s;hopric of Luxen|burg, &endq;which he held for three years for his &s;on Thomas, then an infant.</Q> On the bi&s;hop's e&s;cape, the king &s;eized the lands and revenues of his bi&s;hopric, whereupon he &s;evered from thence the bi&s;hopric of Hexham, which he gave to Thomas archbi&s;hop of York, who, in the year 1114, introduced regular canons there. He al&s;o di&s;membered Carli&s;le and Tiviotdale from the See; the latter he gave to the See of Gla&s;gow, and the former he erected into a new bi&s;hopric, con&s;tituting Etherwolf, prior of St O&s;wald's, the fir&s;t bi&s;hop thereof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contin.

<PB N="147" REF="192">meat, drink, and cloathing, due to the king, for the &s;u&s;tenance of his officers and &s;ervants on the affairs of the crown, was not only granted to the king's auditors attending to pa&s;s the trea&s;ury accompts and commi&s;&s;ioner's, Walter E&s;pee, and Eu&s;tace the &s;on of John, but to the king of Scotland in pa&s;&s;ing to and from the Engli&s;h court, and the archbi&s;hop of York in going to and from the bi&s;hopric. The cornage is expre&s;sly mentioned for the protection of the cattle: So it appears, on the approach of an enemy, on the &s;ounding of a horn, the cattle of the coun|try were driven into places of &s;ecurity; for which protection the cornage rent was revied. We therein &s;ee knights fees, and tho&s;e of the thanes, and men holding &s;ervile tenures, as drengages and &s;malemannis. Reliefs, &s;ines for tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and a&s;&s;aults, and for toll of hor&s;es carrying goods.

<P>Whil&s;t the bi&s;hop was in Normandy, he u&s;ed his influence with the duke to promote an inva&s;ion of England, under an idea that the people, di&s;&s;atisfied with Henry's u&s;urping the &s;ceptre, would ri&s;e to &s;upport his lawful right of inheritance to the crown. On the 19th of July 1101, the duke, attended by the bi&s;hop, and a powerful army, &s;et out on that expedition; but, by an interpo&s;ition of the nobles on both &s;ides, and a con&s;iderable &s;um of money given by king Henry to di&s;charge the expences of the duke's equipment, a peace was concluded; wherein, among&s;t other things, it was &s;tipulated, that all tho&s;e who had aided the duke, and ap|peared in his cau&s;e, &s;hould receive the king's pardon, and be re&s;tored to their ho|nours and e&s;tates.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this treaty, the bi&s;hop regained the See of Durham. After his re&s;toration, he attempted, by rich gifts, and every intere&s;t he could u&s;e, to ob|tain
<PB N="148" REF="193">the king's favour; to which purpo&s;e he laid an oppre&s;&s;ive hand on his bi&s;hop|ric, and heavy exactions on the people, to purcha&s;e an intere&s;t with tho&s;e about the king's per&s;on; but all his endeavours proved ine&s;&s;ectual. Neither could he gain re&s;titution of the &s;evered members of his See; but, on the contrary, the king, when importuned on his behalf, in his wrath commanded, that the charters of confirmation of the rights and privileges of the church, granted by his father, &s;hould be re&s;cind|ed and annulled.

<P>About the year 1118, the bi&s;hop granted to the prior and monks of Durham, the hermitage of Finchale, which he had given to brother Godric the hermit there, to hold of them for his life<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Finchale, v. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the time of his re&s;toration, the bi&s;hop remained in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his bi&s;hopric; and, with great a&s;&s;iduity, applied him&s;elf, in various works, to add to its power and magnificence. Notwith&s;tanding he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Berwick, by virtue of the grant of Edgar king of Scotland, yet, for the better protection of the mo&s;t northern parts of his territories, and e&s;pecially to command the ford anciently called Ubbanford, where the Scots made frequent inroads, he built the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Norham. This fortre&s;s was erected on a bold promontory on the banks of Tweed, and, by its pre&s;ent remains, appears to have been a great work, though perhaps little of bi&s;hop Flambard's erection is now exi&s;ting, the ca&s;tle having received &s;o many &s;hocks, both by warfare and time, and al&s;o repeat|ed additions and repairs. It con&s;i&s;ts of a lofty donjon tower of great height, a double ballium, guarded by machicolated gates; the wall of the outward ballium garni&s;hed with ba&s;tions and turrets, and defended on the land &s;ide by an outward ditch<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camden de&s;cribes Norham ca&s;tle, in his time, <Q>to be &s;ituate on the top of a high &s;teep rock, and &startq;fortified with a trench. The outward wall, of great circuit, was guarded by &s;everal turrets, in a canton &endq;towards the river, in which another wall, much &s;tronger, encircled the keep, or tower, of great height.</Q> This de&s;cription gives a perfect idea of its figure, after the repairs made by bi&s;hop Tu$&s;tall. Towards the river, the ruins now hang upon the very verge of the precipice, part of which, by the wa&s;hing of the Tweed, has given way, and carried with it the &s;uper&s;tructure on that &s;ide; which, with the decay incident to the length of time, has occa&s;ioned a wide breach in the outward wall, &s;poken of by Camden. The tur|rets, as he is plea&s;ed to &s;tile them, appear to be no other than demi-ba&s;tions, a mode of fortification much practi&s;ed in England in early times; a perfect model of which, &s;till in good pre&s;ervation, appears at Hartle|poole in the county of Durham, of the time of the Edwards, being the palatinate port of the bi&s;hopric.
<P>The wall of the ca&s;tle of Norham, which extended from the water, on the &s;outh &s;ide, was guarded with a gateway and tower, Laving &s;quare turrets on each &s;ide, thence a&s;cending the &s;teeps, &s;tretching ea&s;t|ward, was al&s;o defended by another gateway of &s;uperior dimen&s;ions, fortified by two heavy round &s;tanking towers, the remains of which are &s;till con&s;iderable. This was the chief entrance, and fronts a plain of con&s;iderable extent. It was defended by a draw-bridge over a very wide moat, which began here, and was extended round the land-&s;ide of the ca&s;tle, enclo&s;ing a &s;pacious area or ballium, with a very &s;trong wall, garni&s;hed with demi-ba&s;tions at intervals. Within the area of this outward wall are the remains of a cha|pel, and &s;everal other &s;tructures. To de&s;end the keep, or main tower, a &s;trong wall enclo&s;es a narrow area, or ballium, which is entered by a gateway, guarded on each hand by &s;quare towers. The keep is a large heavy &s;quare building, vaulted underneath, like mo&s;t &s;tructures of this kind. Part of the vaults, and &s;ome of the pri&s;ons, remain entire; but all the interior parts of the tower, upward, are laid open, and demo|li&s;hed. The remains of an exploratory turret are &s;een on one corner of the keep. It may be pre&s;umed it was originally uniform, bearing a turret at each corner. The height of the great tower is about 70 feet, containing four &s;tories, or ranges of apartments. The whole building is con&s;tructed of red free-&s;tone, of a &s;oft nature, and &s;ubject to decay. There is not the lea&s;t ornament about it, and the whole a&s;pect is gloomy to the greate&s;t degree. It wears the countenance of the times of K. Henry, without any embelli&s;h|ments of the age in which bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall lived.</P>
<P>It was a formidable fortre&s;s, inacce&s;&s;ible from the Tweed; and, before the u&s;e of &s;ire arms, from its pre|&s;ent remains, appears impregnable, if fully garri&s;oned and duly provided with &s;tores before a &s;iege. When the outward walls were in repair, and &s;illed with troops, the oilets, and other devices for the garri&s;on's fighting and defence, were properly &s;upplied with experienced archers, and the ba&s;tions kept by men of va|lour, it &s;eems almo&s;t incred$ble that this place could ever be taken by a&s;&s;ault.&mdash;View of Northumber|land, v. ii. p. 39.</P>
<P>Since the above work was publi&s;hed, much of the outworks have been pulled down. In the center of a thick wall, the &s;keleton of a man was &s;ound entire, in a recumbent po&s;ture.</P></NOTE>. It appears that this ca&s;tle was erected in 1121.</P>
<PB N="150" REF="195">
<P>In the year 1112, this bi&s;hop founded the ho&s;pital of Kepier, in the neighbour|hood of Durham, which he dedicated to St Egidius, or Giles. For the mainte|nance of a prie&s;t &s;erving there, and for the poor therein to be maintained, he endowed the &s;ame with the vill of Caldecotes, a mill at Milburn, and two &s;heafs from his deme&s;ues in the vills of Newbottle, Houghton, Weremouth, Ryhop, Ea&s;ington, Sedge&s;ield, Shirburn, Quarrington, Newton, Che&s;ter, Wa&s;hington, Boldon, Cleadon, Whickham and Ryton.</P>
<P>Robert, a captain of king Edgar, who had fought gallantly at the head of his army, when he entered his realm, had pre&s;umed to erect a fortre&s;s near to the lands of the See, Fordun &s;ays in Lodonia; but that is an indefinite expre&s;&s;ion, and gives no direction to its real &s;ituation. It was certainly placed in &s;uch ground as to induce the bi&s;hop to believe it threatened the &s;afety of his territories; and therefore, whil&s;t Edgar was at the Engli&s;h court, the bi&s;hop attacked Robert's habitation, and took him pri&s;oner. On Edgar's remon&s;trance, he was afterwards &s;et at liberty; but the Scotti&s;h king immediately be&s;et Berwick, and again annex|ed it, with its appendages, to his crown.</P>
<P>On Edgar's death, Alexander the Fir&s;t mounted the throne of Scotland. This monarch granted and confirmed to St Cuthbert, and his monks, all their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in Scotland which they held in the time of Edgar. In his general grant, he makes particular mention of the lands between Horndean and Knapdean. He al&s;o renewed, by a &s;pecial charter, the gift of the lands of Swinton; and forbids the prior and monks of Durham to an&s;wer in any plea relative to tho&s;e lands, unle&s;s in his pre&s;ence, or by his command<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Appendix to B$de, N^o 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>King Alexander dying in the year 1124, was &s;ucceeded by his brother David. This prince attended the court of king Henry in the year 1126, on that &s;ove|reign's &s;ummons, for the recognition of the empre&s;s Matilda as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The bi&s;hop and prior of Durham were king David's e&s;corts, and were at Rox|burgh with him in the month of July.</P>
<PB N="151" REF="196">
<P>The bi&s;hop was particularly &s;olicitous about the works begun by his predece&s;|&s;or, and carried up the walls of the church to the roof. He added to the &s;acred ornaments divers rich robes and ve&s;tments for the holy offices. He enlarged the common-hall of the mona&s;tery. The borough, of a &s;trong natural &s;ituation, he rendered nobler, and more defen&s;ible, by a wall, which he erected from the church to the ca&s;tle. The ground between the ca&s;tle and church, which was crouded with hou&s;es, he cau&s;ed to be cleared of all buildings, and reduced into a level plain, for greater cleanne&s;s, and to prevent the hazard of fire. He fortified the ca&s;tle with a moat, and &s;trengthened the banks of the river, over which he built an arched bridge of &s;tone, at the foot of the ca&s;tle, now called Framwell|gate bridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii, p. 388.&mdash;Sym. Contin. p. 256.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About a month preceding his death, he was &s;eized with a lingering di&s;ea&s;e, which threatening to be mortal, he commanded his attendants to carry him into the church, where, re&s;ting on the altar, &s;urrounded by his clergy, and a multi|tude of the people of his palatinate, he publicly lamented the injuries he had done to his church; particularly the infringements he had made on the ancient liberties, and the lands and cu&s;toms which he had with-held. Turgot the prior, before mentioned, had been con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of St Andrew's in Scotland about the year 1108, and Aldjar elected in his &s;tead. The prior, with the whole con|vent &s;urrounding the altar, received the bi&s;hop's public re&s;toration of the effects he had u&s;urped, by the ceremony of offering a ring at the high altar; which re|&s;titution he confirmed by charter under his hand and &s;eal<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ranulfus, &amp;c.

<P>The character of this prelate, in the cour&s;e of the narrative, has been noticed; but it may be agreeable to the reader to add what Lord Lyttleton &s;ays of him in his Hi&s;tory of Henry II. v. i. p. 61.: <Q>Ralph Flambard, a Norman, from the &startq;dregs of the people, had been advanced by Will. I. to be one of his va&s;&s;als. He became &s;uch a favourite with king William Rufus, that he was &s;et at the head of his admini&s;tration, and, to the great &s;candal of the Engli&s;h church, made bi&s;hop of Durham. The merit that recommended him to the&s;e great promotions, was a forward and enterprizing &s;pirit, an eloquent tongue, a ta&s;te for tho&s;e plea&s;ures his ma&s;ter loved, but, above all, a very fertile invention of ways and means for the rai&s;ing of money, with a remor&s;ele&s;s in&s;en&s;ibility to the complaints of the people, and a daring contempt of the re&s;entments of the nobles. He had &s;carce any learning, and not &s;o much as an external &s;hew of religion; but a more agreeable wit, a more &s;kilful courtier, a more &s;ubtle law|yer, a more magnificent prelate, was not in the kingdom. Under the power of this man, the commons of England, in&s;tead of being relieved from their grievances, agreeable to the promi&s;es made by the king, were harra&s;&s;ed with more exactions than they had borne, even under the mini&s;try of the bi&s;hop of &endq;Bayeux.</Q> Many times when the king gave orders for levying a certain &s;um of money among&s;t his &s;ubjects, he would exact double the &s;um; with which the king being plea&s;ed, would merrily laugh and &s;ay, <Q>that Ranulph was the only &startq;man for his turn, for he cared not whom his actions di&s;plea&s;ed, if he could &endq;but plea&s;e his ma&s;ter &Dagger;.</Q></P>

<P>David king of Scotland received the news of Stephen's acce&s;&s;ion with the great|e&s;t indignation. He had taken an oath on the behalf of the empre&s;s Matilda his niece, and was determined to &s;upport her rights. He levied an army with all po&s;|&s;ible expedition, and, entering Northumberland, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the ca&s;tles of Wark, Alnwick, and Norham. He lay before Bambrough for &s;ome time, but was not able to reduce it: Therefore, rai&s;ing the &s;iege, he proceeded to Newca&s;tle, which was &s;urrendered to him. His further progre&s;s was &s;tayed by king Stephen's approach, who by ha&s;ty marches, in the beginning of February 1136, reached Durham before it was a&s;&s;ailed by the Scotti&s;h army. King David had his head-quarters at Newca&s;tle; and whil&s;t the two &s;overeigns lay within this &s;hort di&s;tance, peace was concluded between them. By the treaty, David agreed to give up the fortre&s;&s;es he had reduced in Northumberland, on having ceded to him Carli&s;le and Donca&s;ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John and Rich. of Hexham.</NOTE>.

Tho&s;e places were to be added to the earldom of Hunting|don, which was re&s;igned by the king of Scotland to his &s;on Henry, and was then ratified. King David then made a claim, in favour of his &s;on, of the earldom of Northumberland, who&s;e title he deduced from his own marriage with Maud, the elde&s;t daughter of Waltheof, earl of Northumberland, by Judith, the Con|queror's niece. But the earldom being proved not to pa&s;s by inheritance, but by royal gift, king Stephen then only engaged, that if he &s;hould thereafter determine to di&s;po&s;e of the earldom to any per&s;on, he would cau&s;e prince Henry's claim, in right of his mother, to be fairly heard before his judges. This eva&s;ive an&s;wer did not &s;atisfy the king of Scotland, who, about Ea&s;ter in the following year, whil&s;t Stephen was ab&s;ent on his continental affairs, a&s;&s;embled his army, determining to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of Northumberland.

<P>So &s;oon again was this unhappy country expo&s;ed to the mi&s;eries of war. Such exce&s;s of cruelty and depredation were the reciprocal practices of the belligerent powers as di&s;grace humanity; and are not exceeded by the mo&s;t barbarous and uncultivated &s;avages yet di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Scotti&s;h king made no delay in marching his troops to the borders. The &s;iege of Wark was his fir&s;t object; from whence he led his forces into the heart of Northumberland. A great part of this army con&s;i&s;ted of raw and undi&s;ci|plined men, a mixed multitude, of barbarous and uncivilized manners, who ra|vaged and de&s;olated the country with the fierce&s;t cruelty, as far as the Tyne. Richard Hagu&s;tal, c. 316, &s;ays, This infamous army was made up of Normans, Germans, Engli&s;h, Northumbrians and Cumbrians, men of Tiviotdale and Lo|donea, of Picts, vulgarly called Norwegians, and Scots. To oppo&s;e the invaders king Stephen led forth a powerful armament of hor&s;e and foot, and reached Wark about Candlemas 1138. The Scots army, on his approach, retreated from Nor|thumberland, &s;tudiou&s;ly evading an action; and at the &s;ame time attempting to delude the king of England to Roxburgh, and lead him into a &s;nare. But infor|mation being had of the project, Stephen eluded the de&s;ign; and, having &s;poiled the ea&s;tern borders, returned to England, in his way taking Bambrough out of the hands of Eu&s;tace Fitz-John, who&s;e fidelity he &s;u&s;pected.

But a more probable cau&s;e was the great &s;carcity of provi&s;ions. The retreat of the Engli&s;h army gave immediate opportunity to the Scots to renew their enterprizes, and they accordingly laid wa&s;te the ea&s;tern part of Northumberland, which before e&s;caped the fury of the &s;word. They al&s;o proceeded into the ea&s;tern part of the county of Durham, and there committed the like depredations and acts of curelty<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lyttl. Hi&s;t. Hen. II. p. 187.&mdash;John Hag.&mdash;Cont. Sym. Dun.</NOTE>. The king of Scotland was advanced to the environs of the city of Durham, when a &s;edition ari&s;ing among his troops, and alarms being propagated of the ap|proach of the Engli&s;h forces, the army retreated, and, in their way, laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle of Norham, in which were only nine knights with their retainers, who, in &s;uch exten&s;ive works, were not able to &s;u&s;tain a long &s;iege; and, be|ing unrelieved by the bi&s;hop, &s;urrendered on terms of life and liberty, and return|ed to Durham. The Scotti&s;h king, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this valuable fortre&s;s, the key of that part of the epi&s;copal territory, propo&s;ed, in terms to the bi&s;hop of Durham, that he &s;hould renounce his allegiance to Stephen, and &s;wear fealty to the empre&s;s, on which condition he would rein&s;tate him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle of Nor|ham, the damages the works had &s;u&s;tained in the &s;iege being fir&s;t repaired. But the bi&s;hop refu&s;ing to comply with the&s;e propo&s;als, the town of Norham was re|duced to a&s;hes, the fortre&s;s di&s;mantled, and the outworks demoli&s;hed. The Scot|ti&s;h king, re&s;tle&s;s in his avowed purpo&s;e, about the time of harve&s;t, made his pro|gre&s;s into York&s;hire. He left troops to blockade Wark Ca&s;tle, de&s;troyed the corn and produce of the country in his rout through the neighbourhood of Bambrough;
<PB N="156" REF="201">and when he entered the county of Durham, he was joined by a large reinforce|ment from Galloway, Cumberland, and Carli&s;le, by which his army was aug|mented to near the number of 26,000. He was oppo&s;ed near Northallerton by a much inferior body of men, led by Thur&s;tan, the venerable archbi&s;hop, then far advanced in years, with the noble and chief men of the province; and the Scotti&s;h army was totally routed with great &s;laughter. The king and his &s;on, by a ha&s;ty flight, e&s;caped to Carli&s;le<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>, not without much hazard to the prince, who was hard pre&s;&s;ed by his pur&s;uers. The remains of David's army, in their flight homewards, were every where cut down by the enraged inhabitants, in revenge of the horrid barbarities they committed in their late inroads. Be&s;ides the&s;e ca|lamities, the mixed tribes of people which formed the routed army, and had only one great object in view, plunder and rapine, under their ill &s;ucce&s;s, quarrelled, and much blood&s;hed en&s;ued.</P>
<P>no greater evidence need be brought of the &s;avage practices in the warfare of tho&s;e days, than appears in the injunction Alberic bi&s;hop of O&s;tia, the legate of pope Innocent II. laid on K. David and his people: <Q>That all the women cap|tives, &startq;taken in the late incur&s;ions, &s;hould be &s;et at liberty: That, in future ex|peditions, they &s;hould refrain from the violation of churches, and &s;pare from &endq;the &s;word women, infants, and per&s;ons in old age.</Q> Dreadful ideas &s;ucceed to the&s;e reviews: How di&s;graceful to the age, that the&s;e injunctions &s;hould be ne|ce&s;&s;ary among Chri&s;tians!</P>
<P>It appears that the blockade of Wark Ca&s;tle was &s;till continued, until its &s;ur|render was con&s;ented to by Walter D'E&s;pec, lord thereof; who, de&s;irous of pre|&s;erving &s;o gallant a garri&s;on, directed that his people &s;hould capitulate on any terms the enemy would grant. On the &s;urrender, the fortre&s;s was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>What is before mentioned of the legate, was but a &s;mall part of the good works he effected; for, by his intermediation, a peace was concluded between the nations, in which it was &s;tipulated, that the earldom of Northumberland &s;hould be immediately granted to prince Henry, the king of England retaining the for|tre&s;&s;es of Bambrough and Newca&s;tle. The laws and cu&s;toms of Northumberland were agreed not to be changed, but to remain in full force; and the prince, in right of his earldom, was to have no authority or juri&s;diction over the palatinate of Durham and the lands of St Cuthbert, or Hexham&s;hire. The city of Dur|ham, in the month of April 1139, was honoured with the pre&s;ence of the mem|bers in this convention, when the articles of peace were agitated and agreed up|on. Maud, Queen of England, with many &s;outhern barons, on the part of the crown of England; and prince Henry, with &s;everal Scotti&s;h barons, on the be|half of David.

<P>A degree of power, not noticed before in the hi&s;tory of this See, appears to have taken place during Galfrid's epi&s;copacy. The ingenious and Reverend Mr Mark Noble, who lately publi&s;hed two di&s;&s;ertations on the epi&s;copal coins of Dur|ham,

<P>In this prelate's time, Coken was given to the church of St Cuthbert by one Aellafus, a prie&s;t. In the year 1138, Algar the prior died, and Roger &s;ucceeded him.</P>
<P>The &s;eries of civil broils which &s;ucceeded the peace made with Scotland, though the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom were in the utmo&s;t di&s;traction, do not appear to have affected Durham and Northumberland. Stephen had imprudence enough to irritate his people, to &s;pread that de&s;olation over the country which ever fol|lows the cruel foot&s;teps of civil war. The prelates, grown into an in&s;ufferable height of in&s;olence, ju&s;tly provoked his rage. But for him to defy the very power by which he a&s;cended the throne; to oppo&s;e tho&s;e who held in bondage the con|&s;ciences of the people, and, from that influence, a popularity and power danger|ous to combat, was an act of the highe&s;t imprudence. The &s;trong ca&s;tles the prelates, as well as barons, had erected, and their attending on the court with a great train of armed followers, &s;hewed the tremendous moment was not calculated for oppo&s;ition. Had the king, with le&s;s intrepidity of mind, &s;uffered the danger|ous agitation which was then fermenting to &s;ub&s;ide, he might have corrected the in&s;olence of his &s;ubjects at &s;ome more favourable &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ecured his autho|rity without incurring tho&s;e calamities his ra&s;hne&s;s produced. He was not en|dowed with a competent &s;hare of wi&s;dom to manage the critical incidents of this cri&s;is. The original error committed in the beginning of his reign, required much prudence to correct; for the ca&s;tles he permitted his &s;ubjects to fortify, now became &s;o many centers of rebellion and rapine, and places of refuge for crimi|nals of all ranks. One con&s;equence en&s;ued from the&s;e &s;truggles in the &s;tate, that David king of Scotland attempted to &s;ecure the bi&s;hopric of Durham for the cau&s;e of his niece the empre&s;s, which occa&s;ioned much di&s;tre&s;s and affliction in that territory, though it was not involved in the general calamities of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>At the time of the late bi&s;hop's la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, he had with him his chaplain, one William Cumin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contin. Sym. Dun. p. 263.&mdash;Ang. Sac.</NOTE>, who was &s;tiled the king of Scotland's chancellor. Percei|ving the bi&s;hop's di&s;&s;olution was approaching, he gained the confidence of tho&s;e about his per&s;on, and particularly &s;uch as had the cu&s;tody of the ca&s;tle, who en|tered into a confederacy to deliver up the palace and tower to him immediately on the bi&s;hop's death. He concealed his project with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity from the prior and archdeacon, and made a journey to the court of Scotland, to con|&s;ult his &s;overeign's plea&s;ure, and obtain his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in gaining the bi&s;hopric. During his ab&s;ence the bi&s;hop departed this life; and, in the night following his death, (it not being po&s;&s;ible to keep the corp&s;e otherwi&s;e), the bowels were drawn, and the body embalmed. In order that the prelate's exit might not be &s;u&s;pected abroad, when the prior and archdeacon came to the ca&s;tle, in their u&s;ual manner, to pay their vi&s;it, they were refu&s;ed admittance. His death was kept &s;ecret until the Friday following, at the end of which time the clamour of the people being great, the rumour of the prelate's death having gone abroad, they prepared for his funeral, as if he was ju&s;t dead, and he was interred on Sunday. On the Sun|day following Cumin returned to the ca&s;tle, armed with the powers of the king
<PB N="159" REF="204">of Scotland, who favoured his project; and, by every influence he could exert, he induced the people to &s;ubmit to his authority; Fordun expre&s;sly &s;aying, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle by the command of the empre&s;s. He experienced no great difficulty in gaining over &s;everal of the mo&s;t powerful of the barons; notwith|&s;tanding Robert Brus and Bernard Baliol had de&s;erted the Scotti&s;h &s;tandard be|fore the battle of Northallerton, on David's refu&s;ing to retire on the terms they propo&s;ed, in order to &s;ave the horrid carnage of the day, and fought under Stephen's banner. They were the fir&s;t who appeared on behalf of the empre&s;s, who&s;e nominee they e&s;teemed Cumin, in order to protect the palatinate. They were joined by Eu&s;tace de Baliol and Hugh de Moreville. With every per&s;ua&s;ion, argument, or threat, they could u&s;e, they endeavoured to influence the prior and archdeacon to elect Cumin to the bi&s;hopric; which they &s;teadily refu&s;ed, as being incon&s;i&s;tent and irregular. All efforts proving vain, it was propo&s;ed to con&s;ult the legate; and per&s;ons were appointed by Cumin's party, who were &s;worn to act impartially in this bu&s;ine&s;s. But the legate gave judgment again&s;t &s;uch intru|&s;ion, and pronounced an interdict again&s;t Cumin, if he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the epi&s;co|pal function without a due election. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e oppo&s;itions, Cumin prepared to receive the pa&s;toral &s;taff and ring from the empre&s;s on the day of St John the Bapti&s;t; and he would have a&s;&s;umed the &s;ame accordingly, had not the troubles of the &s;tate obliged the empre&s;s, with the king of Scotland, and their partizans, previou&s;ly to leave London. Robert, an archdeacon of Cumin's crea|tion, with the barons of the bi&s;hopric, returned to Durham, bearing the empre&s;s's letters, directed to the chapter, requiring their nomination of Cumin. He was with the empre&s;s at Winche&s;ter, and a party in the mi&s;eries of her flight; &s;o that it was near Michaelmas before he returned to Durham, where he found the king of Scotland, who had arrived a &s;hort time before him, entertained by the convent: He therefore immediately entered the ca&s;tle. He found the prior and convent, together with the old archdeacon, &s;till remaining inexorable to every argument. The king of Scotland therefore left Cumin in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle, as <HI>cu&s;tos</HI> of the temporalities of the See for the empre&s;s; the king pledging him&s;elf to the convent, that they &s;hould &s;uffer no injury under the authority of Cumin. But Cumin, after the king's departure, not regarding him&s;elf as <HI>cu&s;tos,</HI> but as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing the authority of bi&s;hop, received the homage of all the barons, except Roger de Coniers, and made the burge&s;&s;es of Durham &s;wear their fealty to him. Not able to bend the determined re&s;olution of the old archdeacon, he per&s;ecuted him with the utmo&s;t malice, and bani&s;hed him the county. Without a place of refuge, he fled to York, and Cumin, with in&s;atiable re&s;entment, de&s;troyed his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Ranulf, through innumerable difficulties, at length approached the king's pre|&s;ence, and laid his injuries before the throne and the legate. Cumin was com|manded to make re&s;titution; but he de&s;pi&s;ed all the anathemas and &s;entences which were pronounced again&s;t him. In&s;idious offers were then made to the prior by the abbot of Roxburgh, but proved unavailing. At length, a monk arrived at Durham, who was of the Ci&s;tercian order, and &s;traitway was admitted into &s;e|cret con&s;idence by Cumin. He was &s;oon &s;ent abroad to accompli&s;h a project they
<PB N="160" REF="205">had concerted between them, and which afterwards came fully to light. A proper time being elap&s;ed, the monk returned, bringing forged letters of the pope, with a counterfeit &s;eal, re&s;embling the apo&s;tolical &s;eal, by which the holy See expre&s;&s;ed &s;atisfaction at Cumin's election, and commanding Henry bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, the legate, no further to mole&s;t him in his epi&s;copal function. Cumin then &s;ent him to David king of Scotland, with equally forged letters, wherein the pope expre&s;&s;ed his approbation of the oath the king had taken to the empre&s;s Matilda, and that Cumin &s;hould hold the bi&s;hopric of Durham, by her appointment. It is in no ways &s;urpri&s;ing a &s;cheme thus executed &s;hould deceive the king, who immediately cau&s;ed the letters to be entered among the records of the kingdom. He pre&s;ented the monk with a palfrey, and gave him other marks of his royal munificence, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him. Richard abbot of Melros, &s;u&s;picious of the fraud, and zea|lous for the honour of the holy See, to which the&s;e letters appeared to him truly derogatory, &s;et about, with great circum&s;pection, to di&s;cover the artfice; and at length brought the monk to confe&s;s the whole device, to which he declared he was in&s;tigated by Cumin. Innumerable injuries were devi&s;ed again&s;t the convent by the u&s;urper. He had the cu&s;tody of the city gates, &s;o that he prevented all me&s;&s;ages being &s;ent or received by the monks. He frequently prohibited bringing in provi&s;ions, and &s;topped their &s;ervants. He had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the chapter-&s;eal, and u&s;ed it as his plea&s;ure dictated. He built a &s;trong ca&s;tle at Northallerton, which he gave to William his nephew, who e&s;pou&s;ed the niece of the earl of Albemarle.</P>
<P>In the third year after bi&s;hop Galfrid's decea&s;e, the me&s;&s;engers, &s;ent to Rome by the prior and convent, returned with letters from the holy See, commanding them within forty days to elect their bi&s;hop; and if they could not do it in the church at Durham, on account of Cumin's u&s;urpation, then that the ceremony &s;hould be performed in the archiepi&s;copal church of York, or in &s;ome other adja|cent church. Cumin was not informed of this mandate: He be&s;et the roads with troops, and i&s;&s;ued orders that the people of the country &s;hould watch the motions of the brotherhood; and if any of them were found abroad, to bring them to him. Notwith&s;tanding all his precautions, &s;ome of the convent e&s;caped to York, and there, in the chapel of St Andrew, on the 14th day of March 1143, elected WILLIAM DE ST BARBARA, dean of York, to the See of Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contin. Sym. Dun. p. 273.&mdash;Ang. Sac. p. 712.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop elect being ab&s;ent at a council then held in London, was ignorant of the tran&s;action; but was met on his return at Wintringham on Humber, by the prior, archdeacon, and others his electors, who informed him of the tran&s;action,
<PB N="161" REF="206">and, with great reluctance, he &s;ubmitted to the dignity. At Ea&s;ter following he was &s;ummoned to attend the legate, who examined the nature of his election, the authority on which it was grounded, together with the royal a&s;&s;ent thereto, and then performed the ceremony of his con&s;ecration at Winche&s;ter on the 20th day of June 1143; from whence he returned to York. Cumin had the audacity to &s;end his letters, &s;ealed with the chapter &s;eal, not only to the a&s;&s;embly in which the bi|&s;hop was elected, to forbid his election, but al&s;o to the legate, to prohibit his con|&s;ecration; which being di&s;regarded, he per&s;ecuted the members of the convent, and other clergy, with the utmo&s;t virulence. He turned his re&s;entment again&s;t Roger Coniers, who per&s;i&s;ted in denying his homage, and, afraid of violence, fortified him&s;elf at Bi&s;hopton, where he had his man&s;ion. Cumin gaining intelligence of this procedure, &s;ent thither a great force to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him; but they &s;ailed in their enterprize. The bi&s;hop being invited to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dioce&s;e, many flocked to him at Bi&s;hopton, where he remained &s;ome days, and received the voluntary homage of tho&s;e who came thither, treating all mo&s;t graciou&s;ly who re&s;orted to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contin. Sym. Dun. p. 263.</NOTE>. Roger Coniers, and the barons who had attached them&s;elves to the bi&s;hop, with an armed force e&s;corted the prelate to Durham, hoping Cumin would relent of his evil deeds, or might be reclaimed by tho&s;e who were in the bi&s;hop's a&s;&s;ociation; but they were totally mi&s;taken; for Cumin ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to any terms of accommodation; and &s;ending forth an armed force, in an ho&s;tile manner, for|bade their approaching the walls of the city. When the bi&s;hop's me&s;&s;engers inform|ed him of tho&s;e circum&s;tances, he retired to the church of Egidius at the ho&s;pital of Kepyer, founded by bi&s;hop Flambard, a little way di&s;tant from the walls of the town, where he re&s;ted all night. In the morning, Cumin's men forced the gates of the church, and committed various outrages. It would be tedious to pur&s;ue all the circum&s;tances of the narrative given by the continuator of Symeon's hi&s;tory, of the acts of violence committed by Cumin's people. The bi&s;hop made his retreat to Bi&s;hopton; and the u&s;urper's troops were indulged to pur&s;ue every exce&s;s the wantonne&s;s of cruelty, or the avarice of plunder, in&s;tigated; &s;o that to follow this author's fine &s;imile, <Q>like the fore&s;t, over which the de&s;troying locu&s;ts have pa&s;&s;ed, &startq;where neither flower or verdure is &s;pared, a dreary de&s;olated &s;olitude marked the &endq;&s;avage progre&s;s.</Q> Not content with acts of rapine and wa&s;te only, tho&s;e among&s;t them mo&s;t ingenious in wickedne&s;s devi&s;ed horrid tortures for their mi&s;erable vic|tims, &s;uperior in infernal invention to tho&s;e practi&s;ed in after ages in the i&s;land of Borneo; &s;o that, in the very language of this author, <Q>throughout the city ince&s;|&s;ant &startq;&endq;groans were echoed, and death appeared in a variety of horrid forms.</Q> The bi&s;hop about Michaelmas made a nearer approach to Durham, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a place of &s;trength, erected for his &s;ecurity at Thornley. Whil&s;t the bi&s;hop lay there, Eu&s;tace Fitz-John and Stephen de Menyll entered into a truce with Cumin, who engaged to cea&s;e from further acts of violence until after the octaves of the Epiphany. Cumin certainly agreed to this truce in hopes of &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions in his favour; dilappointed of which, as &s;oon as the time was almo&s;t elap&s;ed, he re|newed
<PB N="162" REF="207">his former cruelties. He &s;eized the per&s;on of Humphrey de Thorp in his own hou&s;e, and carried him away from Durham; and a &s;um was required for his redemption. After Ea&s;ter he &s;ent a detachment of troops to ravage the lands of Bernard Baliol, who held a large di&s;trict on the banks of Tees, now known by the name of Bernard Ca&s;tle, with its exten&s;ive appendages, from whence they brought a rich booty, and &s;ome pri&s;oners, which they put to the torture. A truce was made with Cumin, by the interce&s;&s;ion of the archbi&s;hop of York and bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, until a me&s;&s;enger could be &s;ent to the holy See for in&s;tructions in what manner an accommodation could be effected; during which time Cumin was to hold po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle, with one third of the revenue of the lands between Tyne and Tees; and every thing el&s;e within the bi&s;hopric was &s;urrender|ed to the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>New troubles aro&s;e, in which Hugh the &s;on of Pinton, the bi&s;hop's &s;ewer, was a party. The bi&s;hop had pa&s;&s;ed into Northumberland on his epi&s;copal duty, and, returning to Jarrow, was be&s;et by a number of in&s;urgents led by Cumin's ne|phew; but, by the valour of tho&s;e in the bi&s;hop's retinue, who gallantly defend|ed the wall which &s;urrounded the church, he was &s;aved from being made a pri|&s;oner, which was then attempted. The bi&s;hop from this in&s;tance thinking him&s;elf in&s;ecure on the fouth of Tyne, retired privately to Lindisfarne. Hugh &s;urren|dered the ca&s;tle of Thornley to Cumin's nephew, on agreement that he &s;hould marry his niece. The bi&s;hop had placed &s;ome hopes of &s;uccour in the earl of Northumberland, who had entered into a compact with him for putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his bi&s;hopric; but Cumin found means to elude the terms of that a|greement. Cumin's nephew, collecting all his adherents, began to fortify the tower of the church of Merrington, and to defend it with a vallum and outworks; but three of the bi&s;hop's barons, Roger Coniers, Geoffrey E&s;colland, and Bertram de Bulmer, immediately be&s;et the place with the troops they could mu&s;ter. Some of the people fled at the approach of this force, others betook them&s;elves to the church, which they had &s;urrounded with a vallum and ditch, and, &s;tanding upon the tower, annoyed tho&s;e approaching with their arrows and javelins: But the a&s;&s;ailants &s;caling the windows, whil&s;t others &s;et fire to the edifice, the whole party within were taken pri&s;oners. Cumin's nephew was &s;eized, on the fir&s;t day he be|gan this work, with a di&s;order which terminated in a delirium, in which he expired in great mi&s;ery. The time of Cumin's truce with the earl of Northumberland being expired, he levied an army, with which he accompanied the bi&s;hop to Dur|ham. Cumin's &s;oldiers in the mean time reduced the ho&s;pital and church of St Egidius to a&s;hes, with the whole village belonging thereto; al&s;o part of the bo|rough of Elvet, belonging to the convent, they burnt to the ground; and the earl's &s;oldiers, following their foot&s;teps, de&s;troyed the remainder. The earl then proceeded to Thornley with his troops, where the ca&s;tle was &s;urrendered to him; but he refu&s;ed to delvier it up to the bi&s;hop, and placed his own people in garri&s;on therein, who began to make depredations in the lands they ought to have protect|ed, and did much injury in the bi&s;hopric. The unhappy prelate finding no faith in the promi&s;es of men, in deep affliction for the adver&s;ity which &s;eemed to be&s;et
<PB N="163" REF="208">him on every hand, retired to Newca&s;tle, whil&s;t the earl marched back into his own country. The&s;e various accounts place the Ca&s;tle of Durham in the light of a very &s;trong fortre&s;s, as none of the parties e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of the bi&s;hop at|tempted to a&s;&s;ail it. The king of Scotland, &s;oon after the bi&s;hop's arrival there, came to Newca&s;tle to treat with Cumin for the &s;urrender of the Ca&s;tle of Durham to him. The parties met at Gate&s;head; but Cumin gave the king no hopes of his compliance; and, returning to Durham, began to treat with Roger Coniers for a compromi&s;e.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop had little faith in &s;uch a treaty; but, being compelled by extreme nece&s;&s;ity, he determined to return to Durham, where Roger Coniers held the city, and Cumin expected him to be received by the convent. But &s;o it is Providence brings forth events, unfore&s;een by the mo&s;t exalted wi&s;dom of mankind: When the bi&s;hop, accompanied by the archbi&s;hop of York, and bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, en|tered the city of Durham, on the fe&s;tival of St Luke, Cumin, in deep contrition of his offences, pro&s;trated him&s;elf at the bi&s;hop's feet, and voluntarily delivered up the ca&s;tle, together with the whole territories of the palatinate, without any provi&s;ion being &s;tipulated in his favour; and took an oath to make good the da|mages the See had &s;uffered by his intru&s;ion, as far as in his power lay. Thus, after a long exclu&s;ion from the See, to which he had been duly elected and con&s;e|crated, after innumerable injuries and &s;orrows, through the interpo&s;ition of Pro|vidence, the bi&s;hop was received in peace to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his bi&s;hopric; on which occa&s;ion the &s;olemnities were performed with great rejoicing. Some authors have alledged, that, on Cumin's &s;urrender, the bi&s;hop granted the honour and Ca&s;tle of Northallerton, with their appendages, to Richard his nephew.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop was elected in the chapel of St Andrew in York on the 14th day of March 1143, and was con&s;ecrated at Winche&s;ter by the legate the 20th day of June following: He was excluded from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion one year and four months by Cumin's u&s;urpation, and was not enthroned until the 18th of October 1144, after &s;urrender of the ca&s;tle, and lands of the palatinate, as before related<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 333, 391.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop had full exerci&s;e for that benevolence of &s;oul for which he was re|markable, in re&s;toring the ruined churches and public buildings of his bi&s;hopric, and alleviating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es his people &s;uffered in the late civil broils.</P>
<P>The troubles which di&s;tracted the &s;tate do not &s;eem to have reached this di&s;|trict after the bi&s;hop was &s;ettled in his See; &s;o that his whole time was full of lei|&s;ure to pur&s;ue the works of charity and muni&s;icence. He held the See nine years and five months; and, on the 14th day of November 1152, re&s;igned his &s;pirit to Heaven, and was interred in the chapter-hou&s;e. He is de&s;cribed as being a per&s;on of good &s;tature, with venerable grey locks, remarkable for his ho&s;pitality and libera|lity to the poor, of exemplary manners, true piety, much wi&s;dom, and great per|&s;picuity of judgment. He was endowed with profound knowledge in the &s;everal branches of literature of that age, and graced it with per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence. Ever intent on works of charity and the &s;ervice of God, the divine countenance he is
<PB N="164" REF="209">de&s;cribed to po&s;&s;e&s;s in&s;pired every &s;pectator with religious love and veneration. The more he was irritated, the greater moderation and excellence of manners he di&s;played. He gave no di&s;turbance to the mona&s;tery, or to his provincials; and with-held from the church no part of its ornaments or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. His memory went down to po&s;terity, di&s;tingui&s;hed with uniform virtue and propriety <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 718.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1149 Roger the prior died, and Laurence &s;ucceeded him.</P>
<P>During the late prelate's epi&s;copacy, various &s;truggles were made in vain by the empre&s;s Matilda to recover the crown of England; and, after a variety of misfortunes and perils, at la&s;t &s;he e&s;caped to Normandy.</P>
<P>Henry, the empre&s;s's elde&s;t &s;on, having attained his age of &s;ixteen years, a youth of a lively and enterpri&s;ing genius, being acknowledged by the powerful party in his mother's intere&s;t as heir to the throne of England, was &s;ent over from France by his father Geoffrey Plantagenet, according to the prevailing cu&s;|tom of that age, to receive the order of knighthood from his grand-uncle the king of Scotland. On the prince's landing in England, he was attended, by all the powerful barons of the north who were in his intere&s;t, to Carli&s;le, where he was met by the Scotti&s;h monarch. The ceremony of the prince's receiving the order and badges of knighthood was performed with great pomp<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE> on the 22 <ABBR>d</ABBR> day of May, in the year 1149, at Carli&s;le, in the pre&s;ence of a numerous a&s;&s;embly of grandees of both nations. On this occa&s;ion the prince took an oath, that, when he &s;hould a&s;cend the throne of England, he would confirm to David and his heirs the territories which he and his &s;on then held in England, together with Newca&s;tle on Tyne. The prince remained eight months at David's court, improving him&s;elf in the art of war, and in the liberal arts and &s;ciences, which were cheri&s;hed there at that time equally with the mo&s;t poli&s;hed &s;tate in Europe.</P>

Ang. v. ii. p. 846.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the year 1152, Henry earl of Northumberland departed this life, to the great affliction of his father, and the whole nation of Scotland; who, from his many virtues, had cheri&s;hed infinite hopes in his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown. William, the prince's &s;econd &s;on, took the earldom of Northumberland.</P>
<P>A multitude of propitious circum&s;tances &s;lowed in upon prince Henry, the &s;on of the empre&s;s, which united to increa&s;e his influence and power. His father re|&s;igned to him the duchy of Normandy; and, by his decea&s;e in the following year, he came to the inheritance of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine. The next year he gained Guienne and Poicteu, by his marriage with Eleanor, the divorced queen of Louis, &s;urnamed the Young, king of France. The prince's greatne&s;s could not be overlooked by the king of England: He grew jealous of his encrea&s;ing &s;ame, and entertained fears for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, which he wi&s;hed to leave to his &s;on Eu&s;tace. He devi&s;ed &s;everal projects to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="165" REF="210">and, among others, obtained an a&s;&s;embly of the prelates and heads of the clergy, to whom he propo&s;ed having his &s;on crowned in his life-time. The a&s;&s;embly ob|jected to this unprecedented proceeding, e&s;pecially Theobald archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury; which irritated the king to &s;hut up all the members of the a&s;&s;embly in the hou&s;e in which they then were, and to &s;urround it with guards, till they &s;hould yield to his reque&s;t. The archbi&s;hop effected his e&s;cape, and fled into Normandy, which totally overthrew every hope the king had entertained. The proceedings of the king on that occa&s;ion, and &s;ome &s;everities exerci&s;ed on many of the em|pre&s;s's old adherents, determined the prince to pa&s;s over into England, in order to &s;upport his party, and a&s;&s;ert his rights. In this enterpri&s;e he was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that at length the king found him&s;elf reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of declaring prince Henry &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his crown; at which time it was agreed Stephen &s;hould reign during his life. This compact took place in the year 1153; and in le&s;s than a year the king died, and Henry, with the univer&s;al approbation and congratula|tions of his people, a&s;cended the throne. The civil broils and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Stephen's reign, are te&s;timonies of his folly and incapacity.

<P>The See of Durham having become vacant by the death of William de Sancta Barbara, a di&s;&s;ention aro&s;e in the mona&s;tery, touching precedency and authority, which &s;omewhat impeded the election of a prelate. But, in the month of Fe|bruary, in the year 1153, the prior and convent unanimou&s;ly elected thereto HUGH DE PUTEACO, PUSAZ, or DE PUDSEY<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">MSS. Eccl Dunelm.&mdash;Angl.

<PB N="166" REF="211">twenty-five years. The electors formed great hopes, that, from his illu&s;trious birth, he would, with much virtue of mind, &s;upport the dignity of his See, and maintain its liberties and privileges. The election being made known to the archbi&s;hop of York<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry Murdac, a pupil of St Bernard, the famous abbot of Clairvaux.</NOTE>, he, with the abbot of Clarevalle, and &s;everal other digni|fied eccle&s;ia&s;tics, highly cen&s;ured the convent for an act of arrogance and pre|&s;umption, in attempting to chu&s;e a bi&s;hop without the metropolitan's con&s;ent. Whether this was the real objection, as a matter of infringed prerogative, or it was in oppo&s;ition to the court, there is no determining: But, in the reprehen&s;ion the convent received, they were told, in the election of a bi&s;hop, neither per&s;o|nal beauty, or any partiality of favour, ought to be admitted as con&s;iderations; but the chief motives &s;hould be an approved life, and exemplary virtues. It appears that the age of the prelate elect was a chief argument u&s;ed again&s;t him, as being much inferior to what is &s;tipulated in the canon; and his behaviour was thought too &s;ecular and unclerical. No wonder, indeed, the&s;e particulars &s;hould prevail powerfully in the archbi&s;hop's mind again&s;t Hugh. He was a monk of the Ci&s;tercian order, a per&s;on of great religious &s;everity, and, in his own life, a &s;trict di&s;ciplinarian, never yielding to any per&s;onal indulgence, and con&s;tantly wearing &s;ackcloth next his &s;kin. He was rigid$y con&s;cientious; that is, he carried every form and ceremony to the greate&s;t degree of punctilio; and as he maintained the highe&s;t dignity of example, &s;o did he in precept. He was au&s;tere, di&s;tant, and re&s;erved<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stubb's Act. Pont. Ebor. Col. 1721.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the archbi&s;hop found his remon&s;trances availed not with the convent to induce them to revoke the act of their chapter, he lo&s;t all moderation in his re|&s;entment, and broke out into the mo&s;t &s;hameful vehemence, pronouncing an ex|communication again&s;t all the parties concerned therein. The bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, who had the king's concurrence, was the only prelate that appeared pub|licly on the &s;ide of the electors<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Under this anathema, the bi&s;hop and convent made application to the king, entreating his interce&s;&s;ion with the archbi&s;hop for a revocation of the &s;entence; but he remained inflexible to all the arguments of the &s;overeign, and Eu&s;tace his &s;on; prote&s;ting he would not remit the &s;ame, unle&s;s all the parties, with &s;incere penitence, would &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the judgment of the church of York. Ap|plication was then made to archbi&s;hop Theobald, the pope's legate in England, who granted them an ab&s;olution in the church of Beverley: But, as &s;omething was to be done to conciliate the mind of the archbi&s;hop of York, they were &s;en|tenced fir&s;t to &s;ubmit to the penance of the whip, within the precincts of that church. Wharton, from Geoffrey of Coldingham, &s;ays, this act did not add any thing to Hugh's merit of con&s;ecration; and that the convent, who made this ri|diculous &s;pectacle to the public, looked upon it as an act of the greate&s;t decorum, de&s;pi&s;ed the reproaches of the vulgar, and e&s;teemed tho&s;e per&s;ecutions as merito|rious &s;ufferings for the liberties of their church<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 720.</NOTE>. This ceremony was no &s;ooner ended, than the bi&s;hop elect, with prior Laurence the archdeacon, and &s;everal

Geoffrey, in an ironi|cal and contemptuous &s;tile, relates the circum&s;tances of the journey; and &s;ays, <Q>&startq;the reverend troop took the attention of all people as they travelled, who ble&s;t &endq;the incomparable church to which &s;uch illu&s;trious per&s;onages belonged.</Q> The archbi&s;hop of York &s;ent his proxy to Rome, to prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of the tra|vellers: But pope Eugenius the Third<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was al&s;o a pupil of St Bernard's, and an old friend of archbi&s;hop Murdac.</NOTE>, who was of the Ci&s;tercian order, and with whom their adver&s;ary would have had great intere&s;t, was lately dead, and Ana&s;tacius, or Athana&s;ius, the Fourth, elected in his &s;tead, a total &s;tranger to the archbi&s;hop; which propitious event procured them an honourable reception. In|deed the death of the abbot of Clarevalle, and the archbi&s;hop, did not contribute a little to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our bi&s;hop, as all further oppo&s;ition cea&s;ed there. After &s;ome little examination, Hugh received his con&s;ecration at Rome, on the vigil of St Thomas the Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>As they ha&s;tened to return to England, prior Laurence was &s;eized with a mor|tal di&s;ea&s;e, and died at a village in France, from whence his remains were &s;ome &s;hort time afterwards brought to his church at Durham, and interred in the cime|tery yard with his brethren. The bi&s;hop, impatient for his return, ha&s;tened for|ward with &s;uch of his attendants as were not wanted to be with the corps of Lau|rence, and with great joy reached England. On the 2d day of May 1154, he was enthroned at Durham, with univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent; and, in the &s;ame year, Ab&s;olon was elected prior<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac p. 720.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Geoffrey de&s;cribes the bi&s;hop as being a great di&s;&s;embler; that his countenance and character were affected; his &s;pecious virtues and profe&s;&s;ions of honour were hypocritical and delu&s;ive. He charges him with a ba&s;e weakne&s;s, a cupidity of detraction, from which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ear open to all the invidious tales of di&s;|contented and malicious men; who, to win his favour, and aggrandi&s;e them|&s;elves, repeated to him whatever fell from the prior, or any of the convent, either in &s;ecret or in je&s;t: So that his aver&s;ion and wrath were in a little time highly pro|voked again&s;t the members of the chapter. The &s;ecrets of the convent were un|folded to him, and his pa&s;&s;ion for evil communication was gratified with every vexatious tale malevolence could repeat, or cunning pervert, to &s;uit the habit of his mind. The con&s;equence was unhappy; he withdrew from the religious body every degree of confidence; day after day he wore a countenance of greater au|&s;terity, and at length totally refrained from all conver&s;ation and intercour&s;e with the convent, in which he had formerly &s;hewn him&s;elf very happy. At length no|thing was done with impunity. Many of tho&s;e minions who &s;erved his ba&s;e&s;t principles, and poi&s;oned his ear with adulation and &s;candalous reports, were pre|ferred to offices, in contempt of the prior and convent, and, in &s;everal in&s;tances, by an u&s;urped authority. Prior Ab&s;olon, though educated abroad, is not repre|&s;ented as a man of great parts or erudition, and, under the contentious &s;pirit of the bi&s;hop, &s;uffered many of the privileges of the church to be infringed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 721.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the year in which the bi&s;hop returned from Rome, king Henry the Second, on the demi&s;e of king Stephen, a&s;cended the throne. His
<PB N="168" REF="213">fir&s;t attention appears to have been placed on tho&s;e &s;ources from whence the evils of the former reign were chiefly derived; and, in con&s;equence, he cau&s;ed the ca&s;tles which were fortified by the prelates and barons, in the time of king Ste|phen, to be di&s;mantled, and many of them totally de&s;troyed. He did not at that time di&s;turb the fortre&s;&s;es of the See of Durham; but, as an early in&s;tance of his favour, granted to the bi&s;hop a continuation of the liberties and privileges of his palatinate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lands and privileges fal&s;ely claimed by the men of Northumberland during the life of the former bi&s;hop, king Henry II. by a confirmatory charter, grants, <Q>Deo &amp; Sancto Cuthberto &amp; eccle&s;iae Dunelm. &startq;&endq;&amp; Hugoni epo. &amp; omnibus &s;ucce&s;&s;oribus &s;uis quietas &amp; liberas &amp; imperpetuum.</Q>

<P>The reduction of the ca&s;tles was followed by the king's revoking all the grants of crown lands, which were weakly and indi&s;criminately di&s;po&s;ed of by his prede|ce&s;&s;ors. Northumberland and Cumberland came within the cla&s;s of tho&s;e grants which he rever&s;ed; and, notwith&s;tanding the oath he took at the time he received the honour of knighthood, he in&s;i&s;ted on tho&s;e territories being re&s;igned by the crown of Scotland. King David had been dead &s;ome &s;hort time, and Malcolm his grand&s;on, then a minor of tender years, on the throne, was under regency. But tho&s;e territories were not re-a&s;&s;umed, without the king of Scotland having Huntingdon &s;ecured to him; for which purpo&s;e it was taken from Simon de Liz the Third, de&s;cended of the king's mother by her fir&s;t hu&s;band. It was not long before di&s;putes were fermented between the &s;overeigns, a murmur and di&s;content ari&s;ing among the Scots for the lo&s;s of &s;o large a tract of territory. Henry or|dered the fortifications of Wark to be re&s;tored, and &s;trengthened with additional works. But the matters of difference cooling between the nations, peace was maintained during the life-time of Malcolm, who falling into a declining &s;tate, died at Jedburgh in the year 1165, in the 25th year of his age, and 13th of his reign. He was &s;ucceeded by his brother William, &s;urnamed the Lyon. He had imbibed the mo&s;t inveterate hatred again&s;t the Engli&s;h during the la&s;t year of his brother's life, for the injury he conceived his country &s;u&s;tained by taking away Northumberland. From the time of that event there was no &s;ettled peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the nations; for though open ho&s;tilities were &s;u&s;pended by re|peated truces, yet frequent inroads and depredations were reciprocally committed on the borders. King William made &s;everal demands of re&s;titution of Northum|berland, to which Henry evaded giving any definitive an&s;wer; amu&s;ing him with di&s;tant promi&s;es of referring the matter to his council, when he was at lei&s;ure from the broils he was involved in by Becket archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the French king, and his own turbulent barons. To the&s;e &s;ucceeded dome&s;tic troubles of a very &s;erious nature. Prince Henry, the king's elde&s;t &s;on, in imitation of a u&s;age
<PB N="169" REF="214">long held in France, had been &s;olemnly crowned, it is alledged, with a view of &s;trengthening the king's family again&s;t the con&s;equences of a papal excommuni|cation and interdict, with which this kingdom was much threatened; a bugbear in tho&s;e days tremendous to the greate&s;t monarchs. The prince had e&s;pou&s;ed Margaret, daughter of the king of France, and with her pa&s;&s;ed over to Normandy, and thence to the French court, where the wild and unbounded ambition of the giddy youth was wickedly cheri&s;hed, and &s;timulated to break forth into open ex|ce&s;&s;es. He was induced as much by the in&s;tigation of his mother, as his own de|&s;ire of greatne&s;s, to &s;et up a claim to his father's diadem; and pre&s;umed to avow an intention of depriving him of the throne of England. Under a promi&s;e of ceding Northumberland and Cumberland, he engaged the king of Scotland in his enterpri&s;e. In con&s;equence of this confederacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ford. l. viii c 21.&mdash;Chr Melros, &amp;c.</NOTE>, the Scotti&s;h king led a great army into England, in the year 1173, beginning his campaign by the &s;iege of Wark. To form an idea of the people who committed the mo&s;t cruel depre|dations in this expedition, take Ralph de Diceto's de&s;cription. This army, he &s;ays, <Q>con&s;i&s;ted of an infinite multitude of men of Galloway, who were remark|ably &startq;ferocious and daring; were &s;wift of foot by daily exerci&s;e, being al&s;o na|ked: They were dextrous at throwing the lance or javelin, which they could ca&s;t to a va&s;t di&s;tance with great exactne&s;s; and, for clo&s;er fighting, were arm|ed &endq;with a &s;hort poniard.</Q> The Ca&s;tle of Wark not being ea&s;ily reduced, they rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and went before Carli&s;le, where they were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful. From thence they advanced into York&s;hire, having a free pa&s;&s;age allowed them through the palatinate of Durham by the bi&s;hop. Richard de Lucy, who then held the office of ju&s;ticiary, and Humphrey Bohun, con&s;table of England, advan|ced with an army to oppo&s;e the Scots, who retired at their approach; and &s;oon after a truce was entered into by the mediation of the bi&s;hop of Durham, to con|tinue to the end of the approaching fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter; for which Northumber|land paid to Scotland 300 marks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&mdash;Hoveden, Lel. Col. v. iii.</NOTE>. In the beginning of April the king of Scot|land again entered Northumberland with an army of 80,000 men. A detachment ravaged Cumberland, and took mo&s;t of the ca&s;tles in that di&s;trict. Warkworth and Harbottle Ca&s;tles in Northumberland were reduced; but at Pruddoe, on the &s;outh banks of Tyne, a ca&s;tle of Odonel de Umfreville, the Scots met with a brave re&s;i&s;tance, which &s;taid their progre&s;s &s;o long, that the northern Engli&s;h ba|rons in the king's intere&s;t levied a great army; on who&s;e approach the Scots re|treated towards Alnwick. Whil&s;t the king of Scotland lay in that &s;tation, he &s;uf|fered his army to be deranged, broken into divi&s;ions, and detached to pillage the country; whil&s;t, un&s;u&s;picious of danger, the king retained but a &s;mall party near him for his guard. Thus circum&s;tanced, the king was &s;urprized by 400 hor&s;emen &s;ent from Newca&s;tle<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Scala Chron lib ii. Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 532.</NOTE>, under the command of Robert de Stute|ville lord of Knare&s;|brough, Ranulph de Glanville, and Bernard Baliol<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Gul. Nubr. lib. ii. c. 33.

Walter de Coventree adds to the&s;e, Gul. de Streteville, Will. de Ve&s;ey, Ra. de Tilley con&s;table, of the family of the archbi&s;hop of York, and Odonel de Umfreville. A thick fog concealed
<PB N="170" REF="215">the approach of this gallant troop, but yet left them doubtful of the danger which might be at hand. Under this circum&s;tance, it was the general opinion of the party, that it would be mo&s;t prudent to de&s;i&s;t from the enterpri&s;e. But Baliol, of an in|trepid &s;pirit, encouraged them to advance; the fog &s;oon after di&s;&s;ipating, they found them&s;elves in &s;ight of the Ca&s;tle of Alnwick, and di&s;covered the king, with a guard of about &s;ixty hor&s;e, taking the air, un&s;u&s;picious of danger. The Scots did not take notice of their approach, pre&s;uming they were a party of their own troops returning from pillaging the country. When they were advanced &s;o near as to render further deception impracticable, they di&s;played the Engli&s;h &s;tandard; on which the king of Scotland, di&s;daining to turn his back on danger, with great bravery &s;purred on his troop, and charged the Engli&s;h. His hor&s;e was killed un|der him, his party overpowered, and he, being made pri&s;oner, was hurried away by his conquerors, who brought him to Newca&s;tle that night. Benedict of Peter|borough, &s;ays, on the day the king of Scotland was &s;urpri&s;ed, earl Duncan, with a divi&s;ion of the Scotti&s;h army, entered Warkworth, which they reduced to a&s;hes, putting the inhabitants to the &s;word, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex; that they forced open the church of St Laurence, and the par&s;onage hou&s;e, where they butchered about 100 men, be&s;ides women and children.

<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that no one within the earldom or wapentake of Sadberge is named in this return of knights; the mo&s;t powerful in that liberty being Baliol, Brus, and Tailbois. This is another convincing proof, that the royal grants to the See of Durham did not anciently extend between Tyne and Tees.</P>
<P>In 1171 Becket archbi&s;hop of Canterbury was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; the king, to purge him&s;elf from the charge of being an abettor, &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t degrading penance. Notwith&s;tanding the intolerable arrogance and pride of this prelate, his mi&s;erable exit, together with the time, place, and circum&s;tances of the murder, cau&s;ed his errors to be forgotten; and his memory, afterwards, was even held in veneration. The &s;ame day the king left Canterbury, the king of Scot|land was made his pri&s;oner. On that very day the armament from Flanders, prepared to invade this kingdom, met with a &s;torm; the fleet was &s;cat|tered, and many of the ve&s;&s;els wrecked. The&s;e were the rewards which,
<PB N="173" REF="218">according to the &s;uper&s;tition of the age, Divine Wi&s;dom was &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e as marks of approbation of the mo&s;t abject degradations of royalty. The king lo&s;t not a moment to pur&s;ue the correction of his di&s;&s;ident barons; and, in le&s;s than a month, compelled them to &s;urrender their ca&s;tles and per&s;ons. Whil&s;t he remained at Northampton, his royal pri&s;oner was brought before him, like a common malefactor or traitor, with his feet bound under the belly of the hor&s;e on which he rode. Such were the manners of the times. The bi&s;hop of Durham al&s;o came before the king at Northampton, to make his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He was the only prelate in the realm who had given cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect his loyalty. He had, in the former year, permitted the Scotti&s;h army to march through his territories without oppo&s;ition; and lately had &s;ent for a body of Flemings, con&s;i&s;ting of 40 knights and 500 foot &s;oldiers, to come over into England, under the command of his nephew Hugh de Bar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i p. 128.</NOTE>. They landed at Hartlepool on the very day the king of Scotland was made pri&s;oner; the news of which event induced the bi&s;hop immediately to &s;end back the foot; but he retained the knights, and committed the care of his Ca&s;tle of Northallerton to his nephew, with that force for its de|fence. It appears that the bi&s;hop, &s;oon after coming to the See, rebuilt, or other|wi&s;e greatly enlarged the works of Northallerton Ca&s;tle, which, at that period, was one of his chief places of &s;trength. The bi&s;hop, under the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of &s;tate affairs, was glad to accommodate his offences with the king, upon any terms he could obtain; to which end he paid a large &s;um of money into the royal coffers, and &s;urrendered his Ca&s;tles of Durham, Northallerton, and Norham; which latter place he had rendered very &s;trong, by reforming or rebuilding the Donjon tower, and &s;trengthening the outworks.</P>
<P>The king, with the utmo&s;t expedition, ha&s;tened into Normandy, where victory and &s;ucce&s;s every where attended his &s;teps. He made peace on his own terms with the king of France, and received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of his rebellious &s;ons, whom he treated with a clemency and heroic genero&s;ity their offences did not merit. Whil&s;t at Fallai&s;e he concluded a treaty with the king of Scotland, whom he carried with him, fir&s;t impri&s;oning him at Caen, and afterwards removing him to Fallai&s;e; at which latter place he liberated him on very humiliating terms to the Scotti&s;h nation; not le&s;s than doing homage, and &s;wearing fealty for his kingdom, and other &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions too tedious to relate. Soon afterwards the keepers of &s;ome of our northern fortre&s;&s;es were removed. Norham, which was in the keeping of Roger de Coniers, was committed to William de Neville; and Geoffrey de Neville was made gover|nor of Berwick<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rym. tom. ii. p. 564.</NOTE>. The bi&s;hop, to conciliate the mind of the king, who &s;till wore a frown on his former di&s;&s;idence, pre&s;ented him with a free gift of 2000 marks, to induce him to &s;pare his ca&s;tles from de&s;truction, and to purcha&s;e, for his &s;on Henry, the royal manor of Witton. The manor was obtained, but he could not re&s;cue his Ca&s;tle of Northallerton, which the king ordered to be ra|zed to its foundation<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel.

<P>Not long after, at an a&s;&s;embly of the military tenants at Winche&s;ter, &s;ummoned to concert the king's intended pa&s;&s;age into Normandy, it was advi&s;ed by his coun|cil,

<P>A perfect harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between England and Scotland during the remain|ing p$rt of K. Henry's reign. Our bi&s;hop, with Ranulf de Glanville, mediating a &s;ettlement of the affairs of Galloway, in which they were &s;ureties for the &s;afe conduct of Roland, who claimed that province, to and from the pre&s;ence of the two &s;overeigns of England and Scotland, met at Carli&s;le on that matter.</P>
<P>In 1188, the king of England entered into a compact with the French king to go upon a cru&s;ade; and, in provi&s;ion for that expedition, a tax of one tenth was impo&s;ed upon his &s;ubjects, both clergy and laity. The bi&s;hop of Durham was one of the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to collect it in Scotland. On this emba&s;&s;y the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners were met at Brigham in Northumberland by the king of Scotland, and a great a&s;&s;embly of bi&s;hops, earls, barons, and inferior va&s;&s;als. Though the king expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s to &s;uffer the tax to be levied, the a&s;&s;em|bly vehemently prote&s;ted again&s;t it, and neither the &s;oothings or threats of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors could &s;hake their determination.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the king of England was earne&s;tly preparing for this expedition, he was obliged to pa&s;s over into Normandy, to defend his dominions there again&s;t the at|tacks of France, united with the rebel forces of his elde&s;t &s;on Richard. His for|mer pro&s;perity for&s;ook him: His embarra&s;&s;ments were multiplied. Such truces as he could obtain, only &s;erved to &s;trengthen his enemies; and at length his affairs became &s;o critical, that he was obliged to &s;ue for peace, on terms to be dictated by the king of France. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the king's younge&s;t and favourite &s;on John, went over to his adver&s;aries. The king's mind and con&s;ti|tution, weakened by &s;uch &s;evere exerci&s;e, could not &s;upport this la&s;t &s;hock; and, two days after &s;igning the articles of peace with the king of France, he departed this life. His di&s;appointments threw him into &s;o violent a rage, that he cur&s;ed the day of his &s;on John's birth, and uttered the mo&s;t horrid imprecations on his other &s;ons, which the bi&s;hops then pre&s;ent could never induce him to revoke. As his di&s;&s;olu|tion drew near, he ordered his attendants to carry him into the church of Chi|non,
<PB N="175" REF="220">where he then lay; and making &s;ome &s;hort prayers, in a voice &s;o low as not to be heard by the by&s;tanders, but by his ge&s;tures con&s;trued to be penitential, he died there. It is &s;aid his dome&s;tics for&s;ock him after &s;tripping his corp&s;e, and leaving it naked before the altar. He was interred at Fonteveravd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin, p. 243.&mdash;Brompt. p. 1151.&mdash;Hoveden.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus expired one of the greate&s;t monarchs of the age. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the quick|e&s;t apprehen&s;ion and judgment; had a valiant &s;oul, and blended prudence, policy, and genero&s;ity, with courage. Ble&s;t with a &s;tudious mind, he enriched it with much erudition. Such illu&s;trious characters were yet &s;tained by ambition, in&s;atiable $$ve of fame, and an inordinate pa&s;&s;ion for the fair &s;ex. Rapin, from the authority of Brompton<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brompt. p. 1044, 11$0, 11$1.</NOTE>, charges him with attempting the cha&s;tity of all he met, not except|ing the prince&s;s de&s;igned for his &s;on's &s;pou&s;e. In the beginning of his reign he was e&s;teemed the greate&s;t prince in Europe; but his felicity was &s;ullied by the intolerable arrogance of Becket, and brought to de&s;truction by the crimes of his family. By his acce&s;&s;ion, this kingdom became &s;uperior to France; and he added greatly to its powers and honours by the conque&s;t of Ireland. He died on the 6th day of July 1189, and in the 57th year of his age, having reigned upwards of 34 years.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by his then elde&s;t &s;on, Richard, &s;urnamed <HI>Cocur de Lion;</HI> who, &s;oon after his coronation, prepared for a cru&s;ade; for which purpo&s;e he had a&s;&s;umed the cro&s;s in his father's life-time. Not content with the money his father laid up for an expedition of the &s;ame kind, he made every effort to ama&s;s much trea&s;ure, and did not he&s;itate to &s;toop to mea&s;ures di&s;graceful to his crown. He offered to &s;ale his ca&s;tles, deme&s;ne lands, and towns; and relea&s;ed the king of Scotland and his heirs, with the kingdom of Scotland, from all &s;ubjection to the crown of England, for 10,000 marks of &s;ilver; at the &s;ame time re&s;igning Rox|burgh and Berwick for ever.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the king was making his preparations, the bi&s;hop of Durham, enfla|med with the zeal of the times, after the example of many other prelates and ab|bots, al&s;o took upon him the vow and cro&s;s, and, on his part, levied money for the expedition<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sacra, p. 723.</NOTE>. He built him&s;elf a beautiful galley for his pa&s;&s;age, together with &s;everal other &s;hips to tran&s;port his retainers, retinue, and attendants. That he might exceed all the other prelates and leaders in magnificence, he al&s;o prepared for his journey, furniture, and nece&s;&s;ary implements for his kitchen, to|gether with other hou&s;ehold ve&s;&s;els, all of &s;ilver. He made him&s;elf a throne, or chair of &s;tate, of admirable workman&s;hip, in &s;ilver, highly ornamented. It is agreed by all hi&s;torians, that, to rai&s;e &s;upplies for this pur&s;uit, he di&s;tre&s;&s;ed his people with grievous exactions and taxes. The king did not remain a &s;tranger to his &s;plendid preparations; neither could the money he had ama&s;&s;ed, or his re|pentance of the ha&s;ty vow he had made, be kept &s;ecret. The king laid a &s;cheme to avail him&s;elf of this knowledge. More de&s;irous of the bi&s;hop's gold than his per|$onal &s;ervices, he mo&s;t graciou&s;ly propo&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e with his vow, in order that
<PB N="176" REF="221">he might remain at home, and take care of the realm, as one of the regents, in his ab&s;ence. His vanity was in&s;tantly kindled to a blaze, and his eyes were blinded by the pro&s;pect of power, from di&s;cernment of the king's original pur|po&s;e in the application; who immediately, on the bi&s;hop's acce&s;&s;ion to his propo&s;al, applied to borrow the money the prelate had collected, as now being u&s;ele&s;s to him. This brought on a bargain for the purcha&s;e of the earl|dom, wapentake, and manor of Sadberge, to be annexed to the See of Durham for ever, together with the earldom of Northumberland for life, for which the prelate was to pay 11,000. <ABBR>l.</ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Geof. de Cold &mdash; Ang. Sac. p. 724.</NOTE>. The young king, when he girt the bi&s;hop with the military &s;word, and conferred tho&s;e earldoms upon him, could not forbear his de|ri&s;ion of the incon&s;i&s;tent character; and, turning to his nobles, &s;aid, <Q>You &s;ee &startq;&endq;what power I po&s;&s;e&s;s; I have made a young earl of an old bi&s;hop<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gul.

For it was not only a creation of the title of earl of Northumberland that the bi&s;hop was then honoured with, but with the local earldom of Sadberge too, which was granted in perpetuity to the See, whil&s;t Northumberland was only a temporary honour, extingui&s;hable on the bi&s;hop's death. In con&s;equence of this grant, the bi&s;hop, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, graced the mitre of Durham with the earl's coronet, and di&s;played the &s;word with the pa&s;toral &s;taff<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Richardus rex vendidit manerium de Sadberg Hugoni epi&s;copo, Dunelmen&s;i pro 600 marcis, vendidit rex etiam Hugoni com$tatum Northumbriae pro tempore vitae &s;uae.&mdash;<HI>Hovea.&mdash;Lel. Col. v. i. p.</HI> 290.</NOTE>. The&s;e new dignities were not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the prelate's ambition: He pre&s;&s;ed the king for performance of the terms originally propo&s;ed, that he might have a more &s;pecious and colourable excu&s;e for not performing his vow, and de&s;ired the king to alledge, that he could not be &s;pared out of the kingdom whil&s;t he was on his intended expedition; and, for 1000 marks addition|al gift, induced the king to appoint him chief ju&s;ticiary of all England, and go|vernor of the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or, with the adjoining fore&s;t. The pope's di&s;pen&s;a|tion was obtained, it is &s;aid, by a &s;imilar influence. Before the king's departure, England was divided into two di&s;tricts. Longchamp bi&s;hop of Ely, chancellor of England, and legate from the See of Rome, was appointed regent over the &s;ou|thern department, and the bi&s;hop of Durham over the di&s;trict north of Humber.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop's authority and magnificence was now at its height. He not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the official dignity of earl of Northumberland, but had obtained a local and perpetual earldom annexed to the See, and an additional di&s;trict of great extent, by means of which he now held the whole territory between the rivers Tyne and Tees. Sadberge was granted in the year 1189, under the de&s;cription of the ma|nor of Sadberge, with the wapentake thereto belonging; together with the &s;er|vice of Peter de Carow of one knight's fee for Seaton and Overton; Thomas de Amundeville, one knight's fee, for Coatham and Treiford; Godfrid Baad, two parts of a knight's fee, for Middleton and Hartburn; with &s;och&acirc; and &s;ach&acirc;, toll and theem, and infangtheof; with all other liberties and free cu&s;toms, and pleas of the crown, as the king held the &s;ame in his own hands, and as the bi&s;hop held and enjoyed his other lands and knights fees within the bi&s;hopric<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Richardus, &amp;c.

The bi&s;hop had &s;pies upon his conduct, who le&s;&s;ened his intere&s;t with the &s;overeign by their whi&s;pers; for it got to the king's ear, that, under pretence of rai&s;ing a &s;upply towards redeeming him from captivity, he had extorted immen&s;e &s;ums from his va&s;&s;als, a &s;mall portion of which he had remitted; on which account, the king devi&s;ed repeated occa&s;ions to impo&s;e various fines and penalties upon him, and this he did with greater &s;everity, as the bi&s;hop did not even endeavour to conceal his riches, but proceeded in the building of Dar|lington church, and other religious works. Soon after the king went over into Normandy, in the year 1194, William king of Scotland was in treaty with him for the re&s;titution of Northumberland, for a &s;um of money; to fru&s;trate which, and outbid William, the bi&s;hop imprudently made an offer to him of 2000 marks<NOTE N="&verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hoveden.</NOTE>. for the redemption and recovery of his former earldom and honours. From the authority of Geoffrey of Coldingham it appears, that Sadberge was a part now &s;ought to be re&s;tored. The propo&s;al was accepted, and the king ordered the mo|ney forthwith to be &s;ent to him. But the bi&s;hop, too wily to be entrapped by &s;o weak an artifice, humbly be&s;ought the king, by letters, to re&s;tore him to the earl|doms, and thereupon appoint a proper per&s;on to receive the &s;tipulated &s;um; or, otherwi&s;e, petitioned him graciou&s;ly to permit him to apply his money in religious works, for the benefit of his bi&s;hopric. The king, as full of &s;ubtlety as his va&s;|&s;al, di&s;&s;embled with him, and wrote letters penned in &s;uch delu&s;ive language, that
<PB N="179" REF="224">the bi&s;hop was induced to take a journey to London, with his money, on a pro|mi&s;e not only of re&s;titution, but of additional honours in the &s;tate.

Though he was taken ill there, he moved forward to Donca&s;ter; where, finding his di&s;ea&s;e increa&s;ing, and no longer able to bear the motion of his hor&s;e, he re|turned by water to Hoveden. He had attained the age of &s;eventy years, and ye$ te&s;tified the greate&s;t reluctance to dying. When his phy&s;icians told him the immi|nent danger he was in, he was not inclined to tru&s;t them, and gra&s;ped hard at the remnant of life. He cheri&s;hed the hopes of recovery by a mi&s;taken &s;uper&s;tition: for Godric, the holy hermit of Finchale, having a&s;&s;ured him he &s;hould be blind ten years before his death, he con&s;idered the prophecy literally, and did not conceive it pointed out to him the blindne&s;s which pride and ambition &s;hould involve him in; and thence, whil&s;t his eyes continued good, having faith in the hermit's words, he di&s;dained to think of &s;ettling his affairs, and preparing for death. But the ty|rant's attacks were no longer to be diverted: The bi&s;hop's di&s;ea&s;e and bodily pain increa&s;ed; and, by earne&s;t intreaties of his friends, he &s;ubmitted to have his la&s;t te&s;tament prepared, in which he endeavoured to make every atonement he was able for his exce&s;&s;es in power.

He bequeathed 2000 marks to the king, which was promi&s;ed on re&s;titution of Sadberge; and, on the third of March 1194, he departed this life at Hoveden, and was interred, agreeable to his de&s;ire, in the chapter-hou&s;e at Durham, with his predece&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t beginning of in&s;titutions to benefices was in a national &s;ynod held at We&s;tmin&s;ter, anno 1124; for patrons did originally fill all churches by collation and livery, till this power was taken from them by canons.&mdash;Selden's Hi&s;t. of Tithes, cap. 6.

He was elected at Northallerton (according to Wharton) by the monks a&s;&s;embled there, in the pre&s;ence of Hubert archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in the month of November 1195; but Geof. of Col|dingham &s;ays, he was elected in the chapter-hou&s;e on the 11th January.

<P>It is requi&s;ite, that, in this place, &s;ome farther attention &s;hould be paid to the coinage of money, which was permitted in this See, and practi&s;ed in the time of bi&s;hop Galfrid, of which notice has already been taken. The privilege, in the pre&s;ent bi&s;hop's time, was revived, or re-granted by the king. According to Mr Noble, <Q>When K. Stephen, and prince Henry of Anjou, afterwards our king &startq;Henry II. in 1153, came to a compromi&s;e, it was agreed, that the king &s;hould be rein&s;tated in all the regalities u&s;urped, in all different parts, by his nobles<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Probably this was at the de&s;ire of Prince Henry, as he &s;eems early to have directed his attention to the purity and elegance of his money; for when he came over to England in an. 1149, he brought a minter with him who excelled in the art of coining, and who&s;e money was &s;uperior to any before that time. This coinage was called the duke's money. Henry then &s;aw with concern the u&s;urpations of the nobles and pre|lates, particularly in coining their own money, and did all in his power to check it. After this agreement, Stephen and Henry's e&s;&s;igies appear together upon the Engli&s;h money, as Stephen and his &s;on Eu&s;tace's did before. The&s;e types probably were copied from the coins of the ea&s;tern emperors.&mdash;Vide Stow, from Hoveden, p. 146, 147.&mdash;Noble's Notes, p. 6.</NOTE>; by which no doubt was particularly meant the coining of money. It is ob&s;ervable, that there is nothing here &s;aid of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, many of whom were equally culpable: Probably Henry was fearful of offending them, as they had been his warme&s;t partizans; and it would have been difficult to have &s;ettled
<PB N="185" REF="230">their re&s;pective claims, as &s;ome of them had, before Stephen's reign, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mint, and others that king permitted by grants to coin money, as was the ca&s;e probably with the&s;e bi&s;hops of Durham. It was therefore a difficult point to go upon, as it would have been di&s;graceful to Stephen to have annulled the grants he had given. But it was very different with re&s;pect to the nobles, who &endq;could have no preten&s;ions to the right of coining money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The only coin, either of the barons or prelates, which we know of, is one of Henry bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, brother to Stephen. On the obver&s;e, is the king's effigy, with a cro&s;ier, in&s;tead of a &s;ceptre, in his hand, and with his own name and title, and the bi&s;hop's on the rever&s;e. Whether the money of the other bi&s;hops was any ways like this, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain. Mr Colebrook gave a coin, with the name of Rodbertus, to Robert earl of Glouce&s;ter. But Mr Pegge, who is univer&s;ally allowed to be the mo&s;t &s;kilful of $word$ antiquaries, has refuted that gentleman's arguments, and replaced it to Robert duke of Normandy, &s;on of the Conquer $word$; &s;o that nothing can be known of what type the coms of the nobles were.&mdash;Vide Mr Pegge on the name of Rodbertus.&mdash;Archaeol. vol. v. p. 390.&mdash;Mr Noble's notes to p. 7.

<P><Q>&startq;This abu&s;e, however, does not appear to have been redre&s;&s;ed, not even of the nobles, during the reign of king Stephen. But Henry the Second, when he acceded, put a &s;top to the&s;e encroachments of both barons and prelates: He &s;till, however, permitted certain cities and abbies to have mints; but pro|bably the&s;e were &s;uch as had that right prior to Stephen's reign, as it is mo&s;t likely, that, by this regulation, he placed the mints in the &s;ame &s;tate as they were in during the reign of his grandfather king Henry I. and con&s;equently the bi&s;hops of Durham would be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of theirs; for, though Stephen might give them a charter for that purpo&s;e, yet it would undoubtedly be annulled by Henry, as given by a per&s;on not legally authori&s;ed to grant &s;uch privilege. Mr Leake's account of Henry's proceedings with re&s;pect to the mints, in the be|ginning of his reign, in &s;ome mea&s;ure confirms what has been &s;aid above. The king, &s;ays he, &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t, from the Conque&s;t, that made any con&s;iderable regulations in money affairs. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the mints, which every earl and baron had in king Stephen's time; altered the coin, which was corrupt|ed by counterfeiters, by the iraporites or u&s;urers, who were grievou&s;ly puni&s;hed. He al&s;o granted liberty of coining to certain cities and abbies, allowing them &endq;one &s;taple, and two punchions at a rate, with certain re&s;trictions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Leake's Account Eng. Money, p. 52.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The&s;e charter-mints remained, upon this footing no doubt, during his reign; but we are certain, that, in that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Richard the Fir&s;t, the epi&s;co|pal mint of Durham was revived; for Stow, from Hoveden, writes, that in the year 1196, king Richard granted licence unto Philip his chaplain, late made bi&s;hop of Durham, to coyne money in the city of Durham, which liberty none of his predece&s;&s;ors had enjoyed for long time before<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stow's Chron. p. 162.&mdash;Pegge, p. 84.</NOTE>. This long time will be found, perhaps, to be forty-two years, viz. from the death of king Stephen to the 8th year of K. Richard I. The learned Mr Pegge is of the &s;ame opi|nion. Probably Richard, who was often greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for money, received a gratuity for the renewal of this privilege, as he had for many others granted &endq;by him to his nobles and prelates.</Q></P>
<PB N="186" REF="231">
<P><Q>&startq;However, though the bi&s;hop and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors might coin money after this time, yet it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they, or any of the other bi&s;hops, who had the &s;ame powers, affected any peculiar di&s;tinctions upon their money from that which was coined in the royal mints; for Stow writes, that, in the year 1247, the coin was &s;o &s;ore clipped, that it was thought good to change the &s;ame, and to make it ba&s;er. Whereupon &s;tamps were graven, of a new inci|&s;ion or cut; and, being &s;ent to the abbey of Bury in Suffolk, to Canterbury, Divelen, and other places, forbidding to u&s;e any other &s;tamp than was u&s;ed in the exchange or mint at London, all the old &s;tamps were called in. This plainly evinces, that there was, at that time, but one type u&s;ed throughout the king|dom.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The officers of the mints were called <HI>moneyours, e&s;&s;ayers,</HI> and <HI>cu&s;todes cuneorum.</HI> The&s;e mints and officers were under the &s;upervi&s;al and direction of the chief ju&s;ti|cier, or the trea&s;urer and barons of the exchequer. Unhappy quarrels &s;oon pre|vailed, and long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the bi&s;hop and the convent, being greatly fo|mented by the archdeacon, who was the prelate's nephew, by whom it was in&s;inu|ated, that the monks, in many in&s;tances, had u&s;urped an authority they never be|fore exerci&s;ed, and were encroaching daily on the prelate's prerogative; which at length grew up to an implacable animo&s;ity, and acts of great violence en&s;ued. Wharton has repeated a long detail of tho&s;e contentions, from Geoffrey de Col|dingham, which are not momentous enough to merit a prolix rehear&s;al. The bi&s;hop carried his per&s;ecution to very outrageous heights. He be&s;et the church with troops, commanding fire and &s;moke to be put the windows and doors: He prohibited the carrying provi&s;ions into the convent; blocked up the pa&s;&s;ages to the mill; broke down the fi&s;hery-banks; overturned the furnace or oven in Elvet; de&s;troyed St Godric's fi&s;h-dam at Finchale, and guarded the north gates of the ca&s;tle, &s;o that no one could pa&s;s or repa&s;s. He cut off the communication of water from the ca&s;tle fountain, and de&s;troyed the cattle of the convent. He ex|communicated the prior and the whole chapter for refu&s;ing him admittance to the chapter-hou&s;e at the time of their convention. With a tumultuous mob he inter|rupted them in the holy offices on the fe&s;tival of St Cuthbert; broke in upon the altar; laid impious hands on the &s;acred furniture, dragging forth the prior and monks mini&s;tring there. Geoffrey &s;ays, &s;o infamous a tran&s;action had not been known in the annals of the church, except the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Becket. Even to repeat &s;o much is irk&s;ome, and wounds the ear. This author is certainly partial in &s;aying, the bi&s;hop's wrath was excited by the archdeacon's whi&s;pers; for it is improbable &s;uch acts of violence could take place without &s;ome grounds and real cau&s;es. Perhaps the convent were taking unwarrantable mea&s;ures to extend their own power and authority. It is impo&s;&s;ible for a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate reader to conceive any prelate would break out into &s;uch inordinate acts of violence, without &s;ome very &s;triking injury; but what it was lies undi&s;covered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang.

<P>Not long after he was &s;ettled in his See, the king received a fatal wound by an arrow at the &s;iege of a ca&s;tle in le Limo&s;in, which he be&s;et under an oppre&s;&s;ive claim of a trea&s;ure found in that part of his dominions. The events of this warlike prince's life were various; his active &s;pirit made him eager for feats of arms; and his whole life was embroiled in warfare. In the account of bi&s;hop Pul&s;ey's life, his unwarrantable modes of extorting money was &s;u&s;&s;iciently &s;hewn at his out&s;et on the cru&s;ade; and the vici&s;&s;itude of circum&s;tances which en&s;ued, all required va&s;t &s;upplies, which were extorted from his &s;ubjects by innumerable acts of oppre&s;&s;ion. When he came to the crown, he made a tremendous acknowledg|ment of his being acce&s;&s;ary to the death of his father, and Providence &s;eems to have held a vindictive eye over him through every circum&s;tance of his life; for whil&s;t he was vainly &s;pending the be&s;t blood and trea&s;ures of England, in the frenzy of a cru&s;ade, his country was involved in anarchy by the arrogance of an imperious regent, who u&s;urped an authority that did not even appertain to his &s;overeign. On his return from Syria, he was trepanned and put in bonds by a banditti of robbers, who, contrary to every law human and divine, di&s;regarded not only his royal dignity, but the common principles of civilized nations, and held him a pri&s;oner. If the ferocity of the natives of this i&s;land, who di&s;graced humanity by the ignominious manner in which king William of Scotland was brought before king Richard, is a &s;ubject of lamentation, it is equally &s;uch to &s;ee the king of England, by the command of the emperor, brought before an a&s;&s;em|bly of the &s;tates at Haguenaw, by mi&s;creants who were in the mo&s;t abject bonds of va&s;&s;alage. The deputies &s;ent by the queen and council to acquaint the king with what pa&s;&s;ed in his dominions, met in the road the intrepid prince, to who&s;e &s;word Pale&s;tine &s;o lately trembled, ignorminiou&s;ly conducted, like the meane&s;t criminal, in wretched apparel, crouching on a mule, and bound hand and foot. The me|tancholy &s;ight drew tears from their a&s;toni&s;hed eyes; and as they wept, he lifted, up his &s;hackled hand, and dropt a tear. The griefs of impri&s;onment were ren|dered &s;till more pungent by the trea&s;on and intrigues of his brother. At length, for a ran&s;om of 100,000 marks, he was &s;et at liberty. Soon after his return, he con&s;i&s;cated his brother's lands, and declared him incapable of &s;ucceding to the throne. Having &s;ettled all commotions in England, he &s;peeded to take his revenge on the king of France, to who&s;e intrigues were ju&s;tly attributed much of the &s;or|rows of his captivity. This new kindled war brought nothing but encrea&s;ed &s;or|rows to both countries. Neither &s;overeign reaped any material advantage. A truce &s;ucceeded to five years blood&s;hed, in which interval the king lo&s;t his life, as before remarked. Before his death, he was reconciled to his brother, and fa|voured him by his will. His body was buried at the foot of his father's tomb, at Fontevravd, in token of his contrition for the grief he had occa&s;ioned him. His heart was carried to Roan, in te&s;timony of his love to the Normans; and his bowels to Poictiers, in contempt of their di&s;loyalty. His valour was admired by
<PB N="188" REF="233">the whole world, and his conduct in war was judicious and generous. He &s;up ported great magnificence, but it was by extortion, and the oppre&s;&s;ion of his &s;ub|jects; and his &s;plendor was clouded by their tears. His pride held him above mankind: The highe&s;t he regarded with contempt, and the lowe&s;t he &s;purned as &s;laves. His la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s was di&s;graceful to humanity, and he was reproached to his face with unnatural crimes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid, that being one day admoni&s;hed by Fulk curate of Nevilly, a man &s;amous for his zeal, to throw off tho&s;e wicked habits which were commonly called his <HI>three daughters,</HI> he replied je&s;tingly, that it was his de&s;ign; and to that end he re&s;olved to give the fir&s;t <HI>(pride)</HI> to the templars, the &s;econd <HI>(avarice)</HI> to the monks, and the third <HI>(in&s;t)</HI> to the bi&s;hops.&mdash;Hoveden, p. 789.</NOTE>.

<P>It is very difficult to conceive this prelate's character from the &s;hort anecdotes hi&s;torians have given of him. His contention with the monks, and his attach|ment to king John, plainly evince his being a weak man, of a froward and ob|&s;tinate di&s;po&s;ition. To point out the vices of the age, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to no|tice &s;ome canons, a few years preceding this period, for the regulation of the clergy. At a &s;ynod held at We&s;tmin&s;ter, by the eighth canon the clergy were pro|hibited the diver&s;ion of hunting; and, by the twelfth, were re&s;trained from prac|ti&s;ing the profe&s;&s;ion of arms. At the &s;ynod of Canterbury, A. D. 1175, the cler|gy were forbid appearing at drinking entertainments, taverns, and public hou&s;es; not to interfere in trials where life or limb was in judgment; not to wear long hair, nor to exerci&s;e merchandize, or take farms; and not to appear in the figure of military men. Such di&s;&s;ipations had crept in among the clergy, and &s;uch devia|tions from the dignity of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical function.</P>
<P>After a year was elap&s;ed from the death of the bi&s;hop, the pope &s;ent his mandatory letters to the prior and monks, requiring them to elect a prelate. This threw them into much perplexity; on the one hand dreading the au&s;terity of the king; on the other, the frown of the apo&s;tolical See. The churches of England every where laboured under grievous oppre&s;&s;ions and injuries, and the See of Dur|ham was not free from the exactions of the crown, notwith&s;tanding the exemp|tions granted by former &s;overeigns, of which, in times of &s;uch public calamity, the people of St Cuthbert's territories had no means of availing them&s;elves. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e troubles, prior Bertram departed this life. On this occa&s;ion the convent found favour with the king, though little hoped for, who granted them his con&s;ent freely to chu&s;e a per&s;on mo&s;t agreeable to them&s;elves; on which they elected William, a native of the city of Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sac p. 730.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During this period, the reconciliation took place between the pope and king John.</P>
<P>The prior and monks, previous to that event, had proceeded to elect a bi&s;hop, and accordingly cho&s;e Richard dean of Sali&s;bury, but, for &s;everal months, kept the whole tran&s;action &s;ecret, through fear of offending the king, as is alledged, who&s;e opinion or plea&s;ure they had not con&s;ulted. At length they di&s;covered what they had done to the pope's legate in England, and the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Soon afterwards the legate came to Durham to enquire into the tran&s;action, when the convent produced the pope's letters mandatory, and di&s;covered every thing they had done in pur&s;uance thereof. The legate declared they had elected a very pro|per and learned per&s;on, but that the king ought to have a&s;&s;ented thereto: That now the pope and their &s;overeign were unanimous, to offend one was to incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of both; on which he warned them of the afflictions they might bring on them&s;elves. He then produced letters from the holy See, commanding him, as the convent had been &s;o dilatory in electing their prelate, to deprive them now of that power, giving him authority, in the name of the apo&s;tolical See, to appoint a proper per&s;on to the vacant bi&s;hopric; whereupon he nominated John bi&s;hop of

The convent found them&s;elves involved in an embarra&s;&s;ment from which they knew not how to be extricated, or to which of the two evils to incline; either to confirm the legate's appointment, in which they &s;hould &s;in again&s;t con|&s;cience, or refu&s;e the &s;ame, and incur the &s;olemn &s;entence which the legate was directed to pronounce. At length they con&s;ented to &s;ubmit the whole to the pope's will; to which the legate replied, what he had already done was by that authority, which rendered all further applications to the holy See unnece&s;&s;ary. Deliberating a &s;hort time on the matter, the convent a&s;&s;ented to the tran&s;lation of the bi&s;hop of Norwich, which took place on the 16th day of February 1214. Accordingly the pope, in the following month of October, annulled the election of the dean of Sali&s;bury, and confirmed John Grey bi&s;hop of Norwich in this tran&s;lation; but, previous to the day of confirmation, he departed this life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Geof. de Cold.&mdash;Ang.

<P>A contention now aro&s;e between the convent and the king, touching the next election; but they, in maintenance of their ancient privilege, elected Morgan the king's brother, as al&s;o brother of Galfrid archbi&s;hop of York, who was then prior of Beverley. He applied to Rome for con&s;ecration, but the king prevented it by di&s;covering his &s;purious birth, king Henry having begot him on the wife of Ralph Bloeth, a knight. The pope would have di&s;pen&s;ed with this di&s;qualification, if the preten&s;ion of being a king's &s;on was di&s;claimed, and he would in&s;i&s;t on his birth as Bloeth's &s;on: But Morgan declared his being of royal i&s;&s;ue was to him the deare&s;t honour upon earth, which he would not di&s;claim for any preferment; and therefore the election was pronounced void<NOTE PLACE="dagger">Ibid. p. 732.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the foregoing circum&s;tances, it appears, a very long vacancy happened in the See, viz. from the death of Philip de Poicteu, who, according to the be&s;t au|thorities, died in the beginning of the year 1208, to the time that Richard dean of Sali&s;bury was elected, which, as Wharton judiciou&s;ly conceives, happened five years after bi&s;hop Philip's death, and not five months, as Geoffrey of Coldingham alledges; and, his election being &s;uper&s;eded, that of John Grey bi&s;hop of Nor|wich happened in the beginning of the year 1214; from whence to the time of electing Morgan prior of Beverley, who was di&s;qualified by the operation of the canons again&s;t illegitimate children, and the election of Richard de Mari&s;co, which Wharton, with clear argument and many proofs, dates about the 6th day of December 1217, is a period of nine years and a half<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 723.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Wharton ob&s;erves, that the hi&s;tory of the church in this period is perplexed and uncertain; and no wonder when it is con&s;idered what di&s;order and confu&s;ion took place in the &s;tate. In the year 1209, the king, with a powerful army, was in the north, to demand &s;atisfaction in Scotland for various in&s;ults offered his crown, and injuries done to his people. He lay at Norham with his troops, whil&s;t the Scotti&s;h king a&s;&s;embled his army at Roxburgh; but, by the interpo&s;ition of the nobles of both nations, ho&s;tilities were &s;u&s;pended. Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ey married Margaret the
<PB N="193" REF="240">king of Scotland's daughter, and Robert de Ros was his &s;on-in-law, the mo&s;t powerful barons in Northumberland: Add to their intere&s;t that of Patrick earl of Dunbar, who married Ada, another daughter of that &s;overeign. Under &s;uch in|fluence, the Scotti&s;h nation were induced to terms of peace. The armies were di&s;banded, and a conference was agreed upon to be held at Newca&s;tle; but the king of Scotland falling &s;ick, a truce only took place, which was &s;ucceeded by a renewal of warlike preparations, and the king of England again brought an army into the north, as far as Bambrough, which Fordun de&s;cribes to be very formidable, there being embodied therewith 13,000 Wel&s;h troops, 1500 Engli&s;h knights, and 7000 cro&s;s-bowmen. But though the king of Scotland levied a great army at Melros, and &s;hewed much inclination for war, a convention took place, at the interce&s;&s;ion of the great men of both nations, at Norham, where a treaty of peace was concluded. Be&s;ides the&s;e troubles, John laboured under the pope's interdict and excommunication. A gift of his crown was made by the See of Rome to Lewis of France; and an inva&s;ion from the powers of Europe, in a cru|&s;ade again&s;t his dominions, by virtue of the &s;ame authority, was prepared. Add to the&s;e, a con&s;piracy formed again&s;t him by his &s;ubjects, after receiving an ab&s;o|lution from their oath of allegiance. Eu&s;tace de Ve&s;ey, and Robert Fitz-Water, were chiefs in this de&s;ign; on di&s;covery of which, they fled the kingdom, and Ve&s;ey's Ca&s;tle of Alnwick, at the king's command, was di&s;mantled. Tho&s;e troubles did not terminate on the king's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and making peace with the See of Rome, which took place in the year 1213. The preparations for an in|va&s;ion from France &s;till proceeded; no terms of reconciliation with that kingdom being concluded until the autumn of the year 1214. No &s;ooner were the foreign alarms &s;ub&s;ided, than Cardinal Langton, now admitted to the See of Canterbury, &s;et on foot that glorious purpo&s;e which renders his memory amiable to every Eng|li&s;h mind, and his name immortal in the annals of his country. The weakne&s;s of a prince has, in innumerable in&s;tances, been attended with various efforts to ex|tend the royal prerogative, to promote ab&s;olute monarchy, and en&s;lave the people. John's indolence, or imbecility of mind, had already occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of that rich and exten&s;ive territory which his ance&s;tors po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the continent. His folly was expre&s;&s;ed in various incidents in the conduct of his government at home; and as e&s;&s;eminate cowardice is always attended with abject cruelty, he had di&s;play|ed various attrocious acts; in the death of his nephew and captive Arthur duke of Bretaigne, who&s;e blood was on his own hand; the perpetual impri&s;onment of his niece Eleanor of Bretaigne; putting away Avi&s;a of Glouce&s;ter; the &s;a|crifice of the Wel&s;h ho&s;tages, and various meaner in&s;tances in the cour&s;e of his government. He had defiled the bed of many of his barons, and debauched their daughters; had incroached on the privileges of the church; and, with unremit|ting &s;everity, loaded the &s;ubject with the heavie&s;t exactions. He laid the fences of his fore&s;ts open, that his bea&s;ts of chace might be let in upon every private e&s;tate. E&s;tabli&s;hed laws were no re&s;traint to his de&s;ires; and his will was the on|ly rule by which his actions were maintained. His oppo&s;ition to the pope was not derived from principle, but pride; and the a$ra in which he attempted to &s;hake
<PB N="194" REF="241">that juri&s;diction, &s;ufficiently te&s;tified his ignorance and arbitrary mind. His folly was di&s;played to the height in the de&s;pair he yielded to, mixed with the madne&s;s of re&s;entment under the pope's per&s;ecution, when he offered to turn Mahometan, and hold his crown of the Turki&s;h empire. John's &s;truggle with the holy See no doubt laid the foundation of &s;ucceeding events; but many of the ble&s;&s;ings then in the womb of futurity are to be attributed to his folly and want of fore&s;ight. His character &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified the immediate procedures of his people. Cardinal Langton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As nothing was more oppo&s;ite to the barons' de&s;ign of recovering their ancient privileges, than the va&s;&s;alage to which John had &s;ubjected the kingdom, Cardinal Langton &s;olemnly prote&s;ted again&s;t it, and laid his prote&s;tation upon the altar. Pope Innocent having notice of Langton's prote&s;tation, was extremely in|cen&s;ed that a cardinal &s;hould act &s;o directly contrary to the intere&s;ts of the holy See. He dur&s;t not howe|ver &s;all upon him, for fear of putting the whole kingdom in commotion, and inducing the Engli&s;h to join with Langton in defence of their liberties.&mdash;Rapin, p. 274.</NOTE>, actuated by a principle of zeal for his native country, he being by birth an Engli&s;hman, and from a de&s;ire of re&s;toring the liberty of the &s;ubject, rai&s;ed a &s;torm again&s;t the king more formidable than he had hitherto &s;truggled with. He found the exigency of the times required the barons &s;hould be rou&s;ed from the lethargy in which they bent their heads to the impetuous &s;overeign; that the charter of Henry I. in which their liberties were protected, &s;hould be held forth to the people, that its infringements might be redre&s;&s;ed, and its powers e&s;tabli&s;hed. He called upon them, in memory of their ance&s;tors, to attend to the injuries al|ready prepared for them; and, in the name of po&s;terity, animated them to pro|tect from &s;lavery &s;ucceeding generations. The Engli&s;h, no longer able to &s;upport the load of their encrea&s;ing oppre&s;&s;ions and injuries, and fired with the love of their country, with a noble exertion, glorious in hi&s;tory, and &s;tamped on the name of England with immortal honour, in the year 1215, obtained from the trembling and reluctant tyrant, at Runnemede, Magna Charta, and the charter of the fore&s;ts, &s;upported by commi&s;&s;ioners, who &s;hould re&s;train regal juri&s;diction with|in the pre&s;cribed limits. The interpo&s;ition of the pope, who now as abjectly &s;er|ved his ba&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es as before he oppo&s;ed with &s;pirit his malignity and tyranny, did not avail. The &s;truggle became more ardent; the over&s;tretched powers of Rome, in this in&s;tance, fir&s;t &s;hook her authority here. The king, in di&s;appointed pride, reflected, under an ignominious blu&s;h, on the good act he had involuntarily performed. He raged with vexation and wrath, and determined to remove, even with the ruthle&s;s hands of cruelty, warfare, and de&s;truction, the ble&s;&s;ing he had be&s;towed upon his people. He brought in an army of foreign auxiliaries, who were invited over to take for their reward what their arms &s;hould &s;eize. He made his progre&s;s to the north, and de&s;olation marked his &s;teps. The country &s;moked in a&s;hes, and the &s;oil was &s;tained with the bloody marks of brutal ferocity and implacable wrath. The territories of this See were not &s;pared; the abbey of Col|dingham was plundered, and the town of Berwick burnt; the tyrant di&s;gracing royalty by putting the firebrand to the very hou&s;e where he had been ho&s;pitably lodged. The di&s;may ari&s;ing from the&s;e cruel deva&s;tations occa&s;ioned a de&s;perate mea&s;ure, the calling in aid from France, and, as &s;ome authors &s;ay, offering the crown to Lewis. Whil&s;t John on one hand was wa&s;ting the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his ad|ver&s;e
<PB N="195" REF="242">barons, Alexander king of Scotland, with a large army, added to the mi|&s;ery of the people, by committing equal deva&s;tations on the lands of the king's adherents. Hugh de Baliol and Philip de Ulcotes were John's commi&s;&s;ioners for governing the territory between Tweed and Tees, and for that purpo&s;e retained a powerful force. This occa&s;ioned the Scotti&s;h army, as they marched through the county of Durham, to come before the Ca&s;tle of Barnard, which then belonged to Hugh Baliol. Meditating an attack by &s;torm, the king of Scotland and Eu|$$ace de Ve&s;ey went to reconnoitre the place; when a bowman from one of the out-po&s;ts &s;hot a fatal &s;haft, which &s;lew Eu&s;tace on the &s;pot. Alexander made a progre&s;s as far as Dover, where Lewis of France lay, now exacting the homage of the Engli&s;h barons as their &s;overeign. Such were the dreadful vici&s;&s;itudes this nation was decreed to &s;ubmit to: But Providence, in the interval, &s;natched off the tyrant, then re&s;ting from his horrid operations at the Ca&s;tle of Newark.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of Henry the Third, though little more than nine years of age, (an event which took place on the 19th day of October 1216), made a happy change in the affairs of England, under the regency of William Mare&s;chal earl of Pembroke, a man of great &s;idelity, wi&s;dom, and courage. A defection had ari&s;en among the Engli&s;h barons, who were di&s;gu&s;ted with Lewis's arrogance and impru|dent mea&s;ures; and their affections bending towards their natural prince, a breach &s;oon en&s;ued, which brought on a battle, in which Lewis's army was totally defeat|ed near Lincoln, in the month of May 1217. This event was followed by the de&s;truction of a large fleet bringing over reinforcements. The con&s;equence was, that Lewis returned to France, and made a total renunciation of all claim to this kingdom.</P>
<P>So much was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew, that the long vacancy of the See, and the con|fu&s;ion and uncertainty of the hi&s;tory of this province, were the natural con&s;e|quences of the di&s;traction of the &s;tate. So that it is probable, according to Whar|ton, our bi&s;hop's con&s;ecration did not take place till after Henry the Third's ac|ce&s;&s;ion, and that it happened in the year 1217. In what manner the revenue was applied during this period, there is no account: But it is rea&s;onable to pre&s;ume, that, whil&s;t John was making &s;uch enormous demands from his barons and clergy as a &s;eventh of their moveables, the produce of this rich See, during nine years vacancy, would not be a neglected object.</P>

Richard dean of Sali&s;|bury was elected bi&s;hop by the convent, as Geo&s;&s;rey of Goldingham &s;ays, five months before the pope's legate dictated to them the election of John bi&s;hop of Norwich. This tran&s;action is dated on the 16th of February
<PB N="196" REF="243">1214, grounded on the legate's letter to the pope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. ii. p. 353.</NOTE>, dated the 24th of that month. On the 22d day of May 1214, the king recommended Richard de Mari&s;co to the chapter of Winche&s;ter, and, on the 28th day of June, he was elected bi&s;hop of that See, under a fal&s;e report that their prelate Peter was dead. On the 14th of the &s;ame month, the pope &s;ent letters to the king touching the affairs of the See of Durham, wherein a refu&s;al of confirmation of the convent's election was &s;et forth, as being grounded on the circum&s;tance of its having been made without the king's con&s;ent. The pope tran&s;mitted to the king the convent's certificate of their election, &s;igned by William the prior and 40 monks. The matter &s;till re|maining in &s;u&s;pence, the monks petitioned the king to give his con&s;ent; to which, on the 6th September 1214, he &s;ent his ab&s;olute denial, with &s;ome reprehen&s;ions for their contumacy. John bi&s;hop of Norwich died in the month of October following. Morgan was then elected, who, before the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ame year, was rejected. The Durham annals place this election in 1213; and the &s;ame annals &s;et forth, that RICHARD DE MARISCO received the bi&s;hopric from the nomination of Gualo the legate, about the fea&s;t of St Nicholas 1214, and was con&s;ecrated by Walter bi&s;hop of York 22d June 1215. The&s;e are incon&s;i&s;tencies ea&s;ily refuted; for Walter did not obtain the archbi&s;hopric before the month of November in that year, and the 22d day of June did not fall on the Lord's day. Gualo the legate did not arrive in England before the middle of the year 1216, and he retired the middle of the year 1218. Another author &s;ays, the bi&s;hop was con|&s;ecrated 24th July 1218: But this a&s;&s;ertion is no more plau&s;ible than the former, that not being a dominical day. It therefore appears that Richard, at the pro|curation of Gualo, was elected about the 6th day of December 1217, and was con&s;ecrated on the 24th of June 1218. Robert de Gray&s;tanes &s;ays, he was con&s;e|crated about the fea&s;t of John the Bapti&s;t, and that he died in the 8th year of his epi&s;copacy. It is certain he departed this life on the 1&s;t day of May 1226. M. Paris &s;ays, he pre&s;ided about nine years. If we admit he was elected in 1216, and con&s;ecrated 25th June 1217, it would make good his a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ub&s;tance of what Wharton &s;ays touching the uncertainty of the time for our bi&s;hop's acce&s;&s;ion to the See, and the examples he brings to &s;ix the date he adopts. Robert de Gray&s;tanes &s;ays, that, &s;upported by the king's ap|probation, he gave great mole&s;tation to the monks with re&s;pect to their rights and liberties, &s;ome of which he ab&s;olutely took away, and others he altered. There is no evidence in the records of the church of any &s;uch matters; but yet it is generally believed he was profu&s;e and magnificent, &s;paring no expence in the indulgence of his vanities and gratifications; and, in order to maintain his enor|mous prodigality, he got money by every &s;tratagem his love of plea&s;ure could in|cite, or invention devi&s;e.</P>

<P>After the death of Richard de Mari&s;co, the See continued vacant two years and upwards.</P>
<P>The king, under the influence of the earl of Pembroke, gained the e&s;teem of his &s;ubjects, and the wi&s;e conduct of that mini&s;ter promi&s;ed a happy reign, but his death opened a &s;cene of calamities which overwhelmed the land. During the earl's admini&s;tration, the king &s;wore to maintain the charters granted by his fa|ther; but no &s;ooner was that great man removed, than innovations began, and great advances were attempted again&s;t the liberty of the &s;ubject. The peace which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;ome time between England and Scotland, through the pernicious advice of evil mini&s;ters, was di&s;turbed, by reviving the claim of &s;overeignty over Scotland, in which the pope, by fallacious memorials, was induced to take a part, and, by his bull, required the king of Scotland to do the homage demanded by Henry, in order, as is therein alledged, to pre&s;erve the tranquillity of the king|doms. The king of Scotland, on the other hand, &s;o far from yielding to the claim, &s;ent his amba&s;&s;adors to Henry to demand delivery of the counties of Nor|thumberland, We&s;tmoreland, and Cumberland, as his right of inheritance. Tho&s;e matters brought on a conference at Newca&s;tle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fordun.&mdash;Chron. Melros. M. Paris &s;ays at York.</NOTE>. After much altercation, the Scotti&s;h king's claim &s;eems to be &s;u&s;pended, or compounded for, by Henry then granting him lands, of eighty marks yearly value, in other parts of England, in order that the northern border might not &s;uffer mutilation.</P>
<P>The king of England's marriage with Eleanor of Provence took place in the beginning of the year 1236, to the &s;olemnization of which the king and queen of Scotland were invited; and, for their &s;afe conduct, the archbi&s;hop of York, the bi&s;hop of Durham, William de Ve&s;ey, Gilbert de Um&s;raville, Roger Bertram, John de Veteripont, and John, the &s;on of Geoffrey &s;heriff of York, were ap|pointed e&s;corts. The king's marriage brought him under the influence of a new &s;et of favourites. His weak mind was uncertain and fluctuating: The per&s;on whom to day he care&s;&s;ed, the next received his frown, or was di&s;carded. An in|con&s;i&s;tency appeared in his re&s;olutions, which kept the affairs of government in perplexity and confu&s;ion. Like the fluctuations and bablings of an idiot's affec|tions, he &s;eldom retained the &s;ame opinion two days together, but in the morning was di&s;gu&s;ted with the man who, over night, gratified his propen&s;ities; and he laughed or frowned with a kind of involuntary impul&s;e, as an infant that care&s;&s;es and quarrels with its toys. He did homage to the pope, and dreaded his &s;courge with an abject puerility. He was induced by wicked coun&s;ellors (among his fo|reign
<PB N="200" REF="247">connections) to deny the execution of his father's charters; and thence a combu&s;tion took place in his realm, which filled the time of our prelate's epi&s;co|pacy.</P>
<P>The king was de&s;irous that Luke, his chaplain, &s;hould &s;ucceed to the bi&s;hopric of Durham, and, it is &s;aid, threatened the monks, that if they refu&s;ed to elect him, they &s;hould not have a prelate for &s;even years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A brawling matter befell the &s;ame year, A. D. 1228, between the prior and convent of Durham, and K. Hen. III. upon this occa&s;ion. After the death of Richard bi&s;hop of Durham, the prior and chapter of the &s;aid church came to the king to obtain licence for electing their bi&s;hop. The king offered to them one Lucas, a chaplain of his, requiring them in&s;tantly to elect him their bi&s;hop. To this the monks an&s;wered, that they would receive no man but by their order of canonical election; meaning, belike, by their canoni|cal election, thus much, when as they elect either &s;ome monk out of their own company, or el&s;e &s;ome monki&s;h prie&s;t after their own liking. Contrary, the king again &s;endeth word unto them, and bound it with an oath, that they &s;hould tarry &s;even years without a bi&s;hop, unle&s;s they would admit the afore&s;aid Lucas to that place of dignity. All which notwith&s;tanding, the monks, proceeding in their election, refu&s;ed the &s;aid Lucas, and preferred another clerk of theirs, named William. archdeacon of Worce&s;ter, and him they pre&s;ented to the king; but the king bringing in exceptions and cau&s;es again&s;t the party, would not ad|mit him. Then the monks, in all ha&s;ty &s;peed &s;ent up to Rome certain of their convent, to have their elec|tion ratified by the authority apo&s;tolical. On the other &s;ide, the king, likewi&s;e hearing, &s;endeth al&s;o to Rome, again&s;t the monks, the bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter and the prior of Lantony, on his behalf, to with&s;tand the purpo&s;e of the monks. And &s;o the matter being traver&s;ed with great altercation, on both &s;ides, did hang in &s;u&s;pence, till at length thus it was concluded between both, that neither Ma&s;ter William nor yet Lucas &s;hould be taken, but that Richard bi&s;hop of Sarum &s;hould be tran&s;lated to Durham, and be bi&s;hop there.&mdash;Fox's Acts &amp; Mon. v. i. p. 307.

<P>N. B. Lucas was dean of St Martin le Grand.</P></NOTE>. The convent conceiving him unworthy of &s;o high a dignity, and afraid of &s;ubmitting to any innovations on the freedom of election, rejected Luke, and elected William de Stichill, arch|deacon of Worce&s;ter, and the king's chaplain, in the annals of Tewk&s;bury called <HI>Williclmus Scotus.</HI> Di&s;plea&s;ed at this oppo&s;ition to his will, the king &s;ent his proc|tors to Rome to oppo&s;e William's confirmation; and the election was in con&s;e|quence annulled, the pope pronouncing again&s;t the &s;ame for want of &s;piritual form in the ceremony, alledging that it ought to have proceeded through the in|&s;piration of the Holy Spirit; whereas it was a mere egoti&s;m of the electors, who &s;eparately pronounced the election as his own will. They were commanded to nominate &s;ome other &s;it per&s;on; on which they petitioned that RICHARD POOR<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p 333.&mdash;Robert de Gray&s;tanes.&mdash;Ang.

He received the temporalities thereof on the 22d day of July, in the &s;ame year, the ca&s;tles excepted, and was &s;olemnly enthroned at Durham on the 4th day of September following.

<P>On Holy-rood day next &s;ucceeding the bi&s;hop's death, the archbi&s;hop of York and earl of Lincoln brought to the convent the king's letters for the election of a prelate, at the in&s;tance of their &s;overeign; requiring them, for the &s;ecurity of his realm, and to &s;upport the royal favour towards them, to elect the king's procura|tion of Valencia. After deliberating thereon, the prior, the following day, gave for an&s;wer, that many of the brethren were ab&s;ent, before who&s;e return they could not with propriety proceed to the election; but, when they took on them that charge, they would be careful to nominate &s;uch a one as was at once a proper mi|ni&s;ter to God and the church, and faithful to the king and his realm<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. ii. p. 483.&mdash; Ang. Sac. p. 735.&mdash;Rob. de Gray&s;tanes.</NOTE>. The convent, not approving of the per&s;on pointed out by the king, elected Thomas of Mel&s;onby, then their prior, who reluctantly &s;ubmitted to their choice. The elec|tion was in cour&s;e repre&s;ented in due form to the king and archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury; but the king excepted thereto, alledging, that Thomas was inimical to his crown and government, having been prior of Coldingham, and, in that capacity,
<PB N="205" REF="252">had &s;worn allegiance to the king of Scotland; and, as the bi&s;hop of Durham held many &s;trong fortified places within his See, on the confines of Scotland, it was of dangerous con&s;equence to him and his kingdom, that his enemy, and a friend to the throne of Scotland, &s;hould hold them, e&s;pecially one who had already done homage to that &s;tate: That, in the bi&s;hopric of Durham, there lay many &s;ea-ports and maritime places, where troops from France and Flanders might be landed and received, to the imminent hazard of his government. He al&s;o alledged va|rious per&s;onal charges again&s;t him, among&s;t which the mo&s;t &s;triking were, that he was di&s;tempered; that he had been guilty of &s;imony in many ca&s;es, and had not &s;ufficient learning for the prelate's function. The king, it is &s;aid, was render|ed more aver&s;e to the confirmation of this election, by &s;ome indignant &s;peeches thrown out abruptly by one of the monks in his pre&s;ence. The exceptions were to be under the judgment of the archbi&s;hop of York, who was not able to find any ju&s;t grounds to &s;upport the &s;ame, but yet, for fear of the king, delayed his &s;entence; on which a petition was &s;ent to Rome, requiring the aid of the holy See to compel the archbi&s;hop to proceed to &s;entence at a &s;hort day. Robert de E&s;den &s;ub-prior, Lawrence de Up&s;etlington, and Alan the chamberlain, were di&s;|patched from the convent on this matter, Robert de Hexham waiting their arrival at Rome. William de la Hay attended the monks, but they all died on the jour|ney. The bi&s;hop elect obtained the king's licence for vi&s;iting Rome; but, coming to Dover, was prohibited leaving the kingdom by Bertram de Greol, the con|&s;table there; from whence, de&s;pairing of a pa&s;sport on this bu&s;ine&s;s, he returned to Durham, and voluntarily renounced his election. On hearing this matter, the king &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to Durham, to except again&s;t certain per&s;ons, thought mo&s;t likely to be cho&s;en by the convent, and to propo&s;e <HI>Peter de Egroblanch,</HI> a kin&s;inan of his maje&s;ty's, whom they rejected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert de Gray&s;tanes.&mdash;Ang.

<P>During this period the king pre&s;ented Robert de Courtney to the deanry of Auckland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tanner's Not.</NOTE>; and a bull was obtained from the See of Rome, commanding the prior and monks not to attempt any thing during the vacancy of the See, to the prejudice of the king<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Toedra, v. i. p. 388.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thomas de Mel&s;onby was elected prior on the I&s;t day of June 1237, and re&s;igned on the 8th of April 1240. On the 2d day of January 1241, the convent proceeded to the election of NICHOLAS DE FARNHAM, the queen's phy&s;ician, a man unexceptionable at court, and to who&s;e election the king was in&s;tantly reconciled. He received the temporalities in the month of Fe|bruary, and was con&s;ecrated at Glouce&s;ter, on the day of the Holy Trinity, by Walter Gray archbi&s;hop of York, the king and queen, with many of the prelates and nobility, being pre&s;ent at the ceremony, and was enthroned at Durham on the fea&s;t of St Cuthbert's Tran&s;lation. He had &s;tudied pharmacy, natural phi|lo&s;ophy,
<PB N="206" REF="253">and logic, many years, in which he made great proficiency; and after|wards, turning his attention to theology, arrived at great excellence therein. From his learning, exten&s;ive knowledge, and exemplary manners, he became not only phy&s;ician to the royal per&s;onages, but their &s;piritual and privy coun&s;ellor. In this &s;ituation he received advice of his election to the See of Durham, which he refu&s;ed to take, le&s;t the world &s;hold reproach him for not accepting the bi&s;hop|ric of Coventry, which was offered to him &s;ome time before, being a poor See, and now receiving the opulent bi&s;hopric of Durham. The bi&s;hop of Lincoln, Robert Gro&s;thead, took great pains to di&s;&s;uade him from his determination, re|pre&s;enting the duty of filling this important tru&s;t, le&s;t the king &s;hould obtrude &s;ome unworthy per&s;on, of principles improper to have the government of the &s;trong places of the bi&s;hopric, which were e&s;teemed the bulwarks of England again&s;t the Scots, to the great hazard of the realm. The&s;e powerful arguments prevailed with this learned and excellent prelate to &s;hake off his &s;cruples, and ac|cept of the epi&s;copal dignity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Gray&s;tanes.&mdash;Mon Angl. v. iii. p. 148.&mdash;Lel.

<P>He did not hold this See long; for, having obtained licence from the pope, in the beginning of February 1249, he re&s;igned, the convent accepting the in&s;tru|ment of re&s;ignation on the eighth day of February. He had a&s;&s;igned to him, for his &s;upport in retirement, the manors of Hoveden, Stockton, and Ea&s;ington, &s;aid to produce 1000 marks a-year. This re&s;ervation, the &s;ucceeding bi&s;hop, with the convent, &s;truggled much to have rever&s;ed, and for that purpo&s;e appealed to Rome in the year 1250, but received a di&s;graceful repul&s;e. Before the bi&s;hop's re&s;igna|tion, it was alledged again&s;t him, that he was married at the time of his con&s;ecra|tion, but thereupon repudiated a worthy wife<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Annal. Lanerco&s;t.</NOTE>. The truth of this imputation is not made out again&s;t him. He re&s;ided much at Stockton, and there departed this life in the year 1257. He is de&s;cribed as being of an elegant form and &s;tature, a mode&s;t countenance and ge&s;ture, an affable demeanour, and of a grave but per|&s;ua&s;ive elocution. He was interred at Durham.</P>
<P>During this prelate's time, prior Thomas made &s;everal repairs in the church, and covered it with a new roof, the bi&s;hop not only a&s;&s;enting thereto, but al&s;o giv|ing, in aid of the work, the church of Bedlington. He al&s;o gave to the convent 100 acres of woodland, called Milne&s;ide, with power to enclo&s;e it, and granted them free warren therein, and al&s;o in the parks of Aickliff, Ferry, Rainton, and Heworth.</P>
<P>At the congre&s;s of York, the king of Scotland renewed his demand of the ce&s;|&s;ion of the northern counties, imputing &s;everal de&s;alcations, in matters formerly &s;tipulated between the crowns, to the part of the king of England. Otho, the pope's legate, was pre&s;ent, and to his intermediation the agreement which &s;ucceed|ed was in &s;ome manner to be imputed. The king of Scotland con&s;ented to receive lands of 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> yearly value, to be a&s;&s;igned in &s;ome of the northern counties, in compo&s;ition for his claim, to be held by him and his heirs of the crown of Eng|land, on the &s;ervice of rendering a falcon yearly to the hands of the con&s;table of
<PB N="207" REF="254">the ca&s;tle of Carli&s;le. The bi&s;hop was commi&s;&s;ioned by the king to a&s;&s;ign the lands &s;tipulated in this convention, which were Penrith and Sowerby in Cumber|land, as appears from the account in Ryley of the &s;ei&s;in of tho&s;e places, ordered to be given by Edw. 1. in the 21&s;t parliament of his reign, to John Baliol, as heir of the then late king of Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Foedra, v. i. p. 400.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There being a parliament &s;ummoned at London in the 28th year of the king's reign A. D. 1244, and all the bi&s;hops being required by Martin, the pope's legate, to repair thither, touching an aid to the king and pope, the king thereupon, fear|ing &s;ome de&s;igns from Scotland, commanded the bi&s;hop of Durham, notwith&s;tand|ing his former &s;ummons, to remain at home, for the defence of tho&s;e parts, till far|ther order<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prynn. v. ii. p. 63$.</NOTE>. Soon after, in the &s;ame year, the king led a great army to New|ca&s;tle, which Fordun de&s;cribes to have embodied in it 5000 hor&s;emen, completely and finely armed. The king of Scotland was not behind in preparations, and came to Ponteland with his troops, con&s;i&s;ting of 100,000 foot, and 1000 hor&s;e|men, well mounted, and defended with iron armour, or coats of mail of network. The&s;e mighty preparations ended in a treaty, in which the king of Scotland did ho|mage to king Henry, and agreed not to enter into league with his enemics, for ma|king war on his dominions, without &s;ome previous injury, inju&s;tice, or oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As the king of England approached Durham in his route, Thomas the prior, fearful of his wrath for the oppo&s;ition maintained in his election to the See, and well knowing the king's re&s;entful, though weak and fluctuating mind, re&s;igned the office of prior, and retired to the i&s;land of Farne, fir&s;t the retreat of St Cuth|bert, and then occupied by a hermit named Bartholemew, where he &s;pent the re|mainder of his life in religious au&s;terities, giving frequent alms, and exhorting tho&s;e who re&s;orted to him, with great piety and fervour, to the exerci&s;e of virtue, &s;elf-denial, and &s;anctity of manners.

<P>The oppre&s;&s;ions of the See of Rome had occa&s;ioned &s;ome remarkable exertions of the Engli&s;h barons. They compelled the in&s;olent and tyrannical legate, Mar|tin, to quit the realm, A. D. 1245. They denied, by public amba&s;&s;adors, before the council of Lyons, where the pope was pre&s;ent, king John's right, without the con&s;ent of his parliament, to make his crown tributary. They ab&s;olutely rejected the <HI>non ob&s;tante</HI> clau&s;e in the pope's bull, by which he pre&s;umed to di&s;po&s;e of bene|fices, "notwith&s;tanding the right of patronage, or other privilege to the contrary," which in its operation was a total annihilation of the rights and liberties of the church. In the following year a memorial was &s;igned by the king, bi&s;hops, and temporal lords, touching the grievances this country was oppre&s;&s;ed with by the holy See; but the haughty &s;pirit of the chief pontiff was &s;o far from relaxing, that new exactions were impo&s;ed on the clergy. This encrea&s;ed the wrath which already had agitated the minds of the re&s;entful barons; and, under their influ|ence, the king, in defiance of the threatened powers of an interdict and excom|munication, forbade obedience to the pope's mandate; and the affair, by this hardy oppo&s;ition, totally &s;ub&s;ided. The See of Rome did not, from this in&s;tance, de&s;i&s;t from new attempts, or refrain devi&s;ing mea&s;ures for extorting money. Pre|tending a right of di&s;po&s;ing of the dominions of Sicily and Apula, and knowing well the weakne&s;s of the king of England, his vanity, and extravagance, the pope made a formal grant of tho&s;e territories, in the year 1255, to Edmund the king's &s;on; in con&s;ideration of which, the bi&s;hop of Hereford agreed, on behalf of the religious hou&s;es in England, that the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of the realm &s;hould pay 38,000 marks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Bertram the prior of Durham, with his convent, prote&s;ted again&s;t this exorbitant exaction, which was founded on the mo&s;t ridiculous pre|text invention could have devi&s;ed, too &s;hallow to en&s;nare any but a prince of Hen|ry's capacity. The method propo&s;ed to obtain this was as extraordinary as the grounds on which it was projected. He cau&s;ed a number of obligatory notes to be drawn, whereby each bi&s;hop, abbot, or prior, in England, acknowledged to have received of &s;ome merchant of Sienna, or other place in Italy, the &s;um of '*** for the occa&s;ions of his church, and bound him&s;elf to pay it at a day ap|pointed. This was prote&s;ted again&s;t, in a violent manner, by mo&s;t of the dignified clergy; but at a &s;ucceeding convention, where the pope's nuncio &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on compliance, he alledged, <Q>there was no inju&s;tice in what the pope claimed, &s;ince, as all churches belonged to him, he could di&s;po&s;e of their incomes as he plea|&s;ed.&endq;</Q>
<PB N="210" REF="257">This extraordinary preten&s;ion was an&s;wered by Leonard, the deputy or prolocutor for the clergy on this occa&s;ion, who &s;aid, <Q>all churches might be &s;aid &startq;in &s;ome &s;en&s;e to belong to the pope; but it was only in order that he &s;hould protect and defend them, and not appropriate them to his own u&s;e. In like manner, continued he, we &s;ay in England, all things are the king's; yet no man ever imagined the king was proprietor of all the e&s;tates of his &s;ubjects; &s;o, with regard to the lands of the church, it can never be proved, that it was &endq;the intention of the founders to give them to the pope.</Q> M. Paris &s;ets forth the pope's bull for this exaction, which &s;hews that nothing was done in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the notes but by his expre&s;s authority. It concludes in the&s;e words: <Q>&startq;You &s;hall take care to let the king know, that all this is our will and plea&s;ure; wherefore I &s;et down in the&s;e pre&s;ents what each abbot and prior &s;hall be bound to pay: The prior and mona&s;tery of Durham, 500 marks; of Bath, 400; Thorney, 400; &amp;c.

<P>Soon after the above matter &s;ub&s;ided, the prior of Durham re&s;igned his office, 15th Augu&s;t 1258, and had a&s;&s;igned him for maintenance the churches of Pittington, Heighington, and &s;ome other places; and Hugh de Derlington, the &s;ub-prior, was elected in his room, 16th Augu&s;t 1258.</P>
<P>The unhappy di&s;&s;entions &s;till prevailing in Scotland between K. Alex. III. and one party of his nobles, the queen-dowager of Scotland, who had married John de Acre, &s;on to the king of Jeru&s;alem, on a vi&s;it to the Scotti&s;h court, became mediator for a reconciliation and coalition of parties. The king of England, be|ing then engaged in a campaign again&s;t the Welch, deputed the archbi&s;hop of York, the bi&s;hop of Durham, Richard de Quincy earl of Winche&s;ter, Bertram prior of Durham, John Maun&s;el provo&s;t of Beverley, Gilberton de Pre&s;ton, and William Latimer, with powers to conclude, in conjunction with the king of Scot|land's council, &s;uch matters as they judged were con&s;i&s;tent with the honour of the two &s;tates. For this purpo&s;e they met at Stirling, without forming any effective plan. In le&s;s than two months the earl of Monteith &s;eized the king in bed at Kin|ro&s;s, under pretence of re&s;cuing him from the hands of per&s;ons excommunicated. The king of England at the time of this event was waging war with the Welch; and the chiefs of the Scotti&s;h faction entered into a treaty of alliance with them again&s;t England; which occa&s;ioned tho&s;e per&s;ons who were in the oppo&s;ite party to fly for protection to Henry's court.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of the year 1258 proved exce&s;&s;ively turbulent in England. Simon de Montford earl of Leice&s;ter, offended at the king's partiality to his brothers by the mother's &s;ide, as well as other foreigners, entered into a combination to expel them the kingdom. Not contented with having effected his purpo&s;e, but &s;eeing the king's party greatly weakened, as well by this mea&s;ure as the defection of ma|ny whom he had treated with levity and di&s;re&s;pect, the confederates e&s;tabli&s;hed a council, to whom, after many &s;truggles, they compelled the king to commit the direction of all public affairs, that the many grievances of the people might be $edre&s;&s;ed; and this ju$to required the king's &s;ubjects in general to &s;wear to an ob|&s;ervance
<PB N="211" REF="258">of the regulations then e&s;tabli&s;hed, which were afterwards known by the name of the <HI>Oxford Provi&s;ions.</HI> This new &s;y&s;tem of government was formed in June, in a parliament held at Oxford, which, from their extravagant projects and mea&s;ures, was &s;tiled the <HI>Mad Parliament.</HI> The contemptible figure the king of England made in this &s;ituation, no doubt reduced his con&s;equence with the court of Scot|land. The prevailing party there had &s;een him under the mo&s;t de&s;picable light; in one moment, with the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations, prote&s;ting to his a&s;&s;embled &s;tates, that he would ob&s;erve and keep inviolate his father's charters, and in the n$xt, in contempt of the mo&s;t horrid anathema, projecting and executing mea|&s;ures totally adver&s;e. They had &s;een him the dupe of the See of Rome, draining his kingdom of its wealth, for the maintenance of a vi&s;ionary title to the crown of Sicily, given to his &s;on Edmund by the magical power of that See: And whil&s;t the king of England was thus lavi&s;hly pouring out his trea&s;ures, Manfrid was &s;uffered to wear the crown of that &s;tate in quiet, without the pope's u&s;ing any ef|forts to depo&s;e him. They &s;aw Richard, the king's other brother, adding to the calamities of the people by draining the &s;tate of 700,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, a va&s;t &s;um in tho&s;e days, to &s;upport the title of king of the Romans: And now they beheld the government repo&s;ed in the hands of a junto, at who&s;e head was placed the im|petuous earl of Leice&s;ter. Under tho&s;e circum&s;tances an attempt was made by the regents to conciliate the minds of the Scotti&s;h partizans; for which purpo&s;e &s;everal of the Engli&s;h nobles met the king at Melros. What project the Engli&s;h had formed, hi&s;torians have not declared with preci&s;ion; but certain it is a con&s;i|derable body of forces was drawn down to the borders. Norham and Wark Ca&s;tles were put under the government of Robert de Nevil lord of Raby, who had in&s;tructions to have provi&s;ion of hor&s;e and arms in readine&s;s for a &s;ecret ex|pedition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neville, in the following year, was al&s;o made governor of the Ca&s;tle of Bambrough. &mdash;Dugd.

<P>Immediately after the death of bi&s;hop Kirkham, on the 30th day of September &s;ucceeding, a new prelate was elected.</P>
<P>ROBERT DE STICHILL, then prior of Finchale, (who took his name probably from Stichehille, a place on the north borders, near the hills of Cheviot) was nominated by the convent: He was confirmed by Godfride archbi&s;hop of York on the day of St Clement, being the 23d of November 1260. He received re&s;titution of the temporalities from the king on the 5th day of December, and was con&s;ecrated by the &s;ame archbi&s;hop at Southwell, on the 13th day of February 1261. He was bred a monk in the mona&s;tery of Durham, where, in his youth, he di&s;covered much levity of tem|per, for which he underwent &s;ome in&s;tances of di&s;grace. Impelled by &s;hame, or the violence of his di&s;po&s;ition, he formed a re&s;olution to quit the mona&s;tic di&s;ci|pline, and fly by night from the cloi&s;ter; but he was &s;tayed by a mental remor&s;e,
<PB N="215" REF="262">or other &s;ecret influence, from &s;o ra&s;h a determination, his heart being enlivened with hopes of advancement, in future life, in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Gray&s;tanes.&mdash;Ang. Sac. p. 739.</NOTE>. The monki&s;h writers give this determination a ca&s;t of miraculous interpo&s;ition; but let the incitement be what it would, the con&s;equence was excellent: He gave a check to his temper and puerile levitie, applied him&s;elf &s;trictly to his &s;tudies, became a religious ob&s;erver of his duty, and attained &s;uch proficiency, both in religious con|duct and divine learning, as to gain the approbation of the whole &s;ociety. He was the &s;on of a prie&s;t, and, by the canons, deprived of eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferment; but his growing virtues &s;o ingratiated him into the favour of tho&s;e who knew him, particularly Henry de Hornca&s;tre, afterwards prior of Coldingham, a man of great knowledge in temporal as well as &s;piritual concerns, that, unknown to him, he obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation by which he a&s;cended to his dignities in the church. He was for &s;everal years prior of Finchale, which office he filled with great propriety of character. Soon after his con&s;ecration, he gave to the convent 1300 acres of woodland, the better to enable them to proceed in their religious edifices. After &s;ome altercation between him and the convent, he obliged the monks, as &s;oon as they had profe&s;&s;ed before the prior, to do the &s;ame before him, and receive his &s;olemn benediction. After the re&s;ignation of prior Hugh, in the year 1272, he took the cu&s;tody of the church and convent, during the vacancy of the office of prior; and an unhappy di&s;agreement prevailed for &s;ome time touching formalities requi&s;ite in the election, the bi&s;hop in&s;i&s;ting on his being &s;tiled <HI>patron and &s;upreme;</HI> alledging, if he was not patron, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for them to require his con&s;ent for electing their prior.</P>
<P>He joined with the prior and convent in making the church of Hoveden colle|giate.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the &s;tate, &s;oon after our bi&s;hop's acce&s;&s;ion, grew to a great height. The king, &s;upported by the papal authority in his mo&s;t extravagant pur|po&s;es, now exhibited a bull, under which he and his &s;ubjects had a di&s;pen&s;ation from their oath of ob&s;ervance of the Oxford Provi&s;ions. Simon de Montford earl of Leice&s;ter had &s;hewn principles tending, as it was conjectured, to lead him to the throne: He a&s;&s;umed the chief authority, and pre&s;umed to act without the council or concurrence of the re&s;t of his a&s;&s;ociates. This &s;oon &s;evered the earl of Glouce&s;ter from his intere&s;t; he went over to the king, who, under the influence of the pope's di&s;pen&s;ation, rejected the admini&s;tration of the &s;elect council, and re&s;umed the reins of government. The king maintained his authority with great difficulty for about two years, in which time he lo&s;t the &s;upport of the earl of Glouce&s;ter and &s;everal others of his mo&s;t powerful and &s;age adherents, who were taken off by death. The earl of Leice&s;ter was not only a &s;kilful politician, but al&s;o a mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous per&s;on in &s;uch affairs as he engaged in. With every exertion he &s;trove, under the pre&s;ent conjuncture, to encrea&s;e his party, and &s;trengthen his influence; till at length a favourable time appeared for him to declare open war again&s;t the king, who was extending his prerogative in every in&s;tance, to the hazard
<PB N="216" REF="263">of the liberty of the people. Immediately on the in&s;urrection of the barons, with Leice&s;ter at their head, the king appointed Robert de Neville captain-general of all his forces north of Trent, &s;heriff of York&s;hire, and governor of the Ca&s;tle of York. After Neville's acceptance of this great tru&s;t, he wrote to the king's chancellor to reque&s;t, that &s;ufficient funds might be formed for executing the charge he had a&s;&s;umed, as well as the maintenance of the Ca&s;tle of Bambrough, which he al&s;o then held; to enforce which reque&s;t, he reported the intelligence he had received of a de&s;cent having been made on the northern parts of Scotland, by the kings of Denmark and Norway, with a powerful fleet; and as their in|tention was not fully known, there was rea&s;on to doubt the di&s;trict entru&s;ted to his care was in &s;ome jeopardy. He al&s;o wrote to the king, reque&s;ting his royal mandate to the lords Robert de Brus, John Comyn, John Baliol, and Hugh Percy, and his other great barons in the north, commanding them to be aiding in the pre&s;ervation of peace in the country under his &s;uperintendency. The king of Scot|land interpo&s;ed, and exerted his influence to bring about a reconciliation between the king and his barons; but in vain; the invaders, by a fatal battle, and &s;ucceed|ing &s;torm at &s;ea, being totally di&s;comfited, and their di&s;heartened remains having retired from the country, he was at lei&s;ure to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king of England; and we find the powerful barons above named, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in both kingdoms, led a large body of Scots auxiliaries &s;outhward for that purpo&s;e. They were with the king at the battle of Northampton, where his party prevailed; but the &s;ucce&s;s of that day was &s;oon rever&s;ed by the fatal field of Lewes in Su&s;&s;ex, A. D. 1264, where the king, his brother Richard king of Jeru&s;alem, and his gallant &s;on Ed|ward, were all made pri&s;oners, and their army totally routed.

<P>Little merit is to be attributed to the king in the &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es which &s;uc|ceeded this victory; the great military &s;kill and political powers of the king of Je|$$alem, with the alacrity, fortitude, and valour of prince Edward, chiefly con|tributed to the fortunate events which en&s;ued. The earl of Leice&s;ter's &s;ons, and others of his accomplices, who e&s;caped the &s;laughter of Eve&s;ham field, in mere de&s;pair and di&s;appointed rage, made &s;everal vigorous efforts to &s;upport their &s;ink|ing cau&s;e, in different parts of the kingdom, which, to delude the people, and palliate their crime, they every where declared was not in oppo&s;ition to the king's right of ruling, but for the redre&s;s of national grievances, and to remove arbi|trary and oppre&s;&s;ive principles, which had crept into government contrary to the con&s;titution, and liberty of the &s;ubject: But, notwith&s;tanding the &s;peciou&s;ne&s;s of the pretext, all parties in the rebellion were &s;oon &s;ubdued by the prowe&s;s and wife conduct of prince Edward, which every where prevailed. The northern barons who were in Leice&s;ter's party, were la&s;t of being reduced, they having been treated with great rigour, in the confi&s;cation of their property and forfeiture of their lands, and thence driven to de&s;pair. At their head was John de Ve&s;ey lord of Alnwick. On &s;ubmitting to the prince's clemency, the forfeitures were re|laxed, and their property put under a fine.</P>
<P>The earl of Leice&s;ter, or Peter de Montford his &s;on, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the manor of Greatham, within the palatinate of Durham, which by this rebellion became forfeited. The king immediately &s;eized the &s;ame, believing, as he &s;ets forth in his grant after mentioned, that &s;uch forfeitures belonged to his crown within the liberties of Durham, equally with tho&s;e lying out of that juri&s;diction; and he gave it to his favourite Thomas de Clare. The bi&s;hop profecuted his claim for this for|feited manor, as being the right of his See, where, under the <HI>jura regalia</HI> of his palatinate, he had a ju&s;t title to all &s;uch forfeited lands, and other things, as the king had in right of his crown in other parts of his realm. And the &s;ame being brought before the king's council, the king, by his letters patent to the bi&s;hop, &s;etting forth, that at the in&s;tance of him, and others his faithful &s;ubjects, and by the information of his council, he was given to under&s;tand, that he could not make &s;uch grant, <HI>without doing wrong to the bi&s;hop and his church, and injuring the afore&s;aid liberty,</HI> in which he had <HI>jura regalia;</HI> and being induced at come to do &s;trict ju&s;tice, and re&s;tore to the bi&s;hop his right, he revoked the grant to Clare, and for him and his heirs willed and granted, that the bi&s;hop &s;hould do his plea|&s;ure within the &s;aid mannor, and others the lands and tenements within his rega|lity, forfeited, and to him e&s;cheated, as the king did with other lands forfeited to his crown; declaring, that &s;uch before mentioned grant to Clare &s;hould not be made a precedent, or the bi&s;hop, or his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, or their liberty, &s;hould be in any wife prejudiced thereby in future.

By the rehear&s;als in the before mentioned royal letters patent, it is &s;hewn, that Greatham was the e&s;tate of Peter de Montford; and &s;uch authority is preferable to the a&s;&s;ertions of &s;ome authors, who &s;ay the forfeiture was derived from Simon earl of Leice&s;ter. It appears that the bi&s;hop, to &s;ecure the title, purcha&s;ed the claim of Peter de Montford, the &s;on of Peter, which he confirmed by his grant. But what &s;eems mo&s;t &s;ingular is, that, in the deed of foundation of the ho&s;pital after mentioned, the bi&s;hop doth not &s;et forth, that he came to the manor by forfeiture, but by the grant of Peter, <Q><HI>Ex dono &s;pecialis amici no&s;tri domini Petri de Monteforti ad divini &startq;&endq;numinis cultum augmentandum,</HI></Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which tends to depreciate the dignity of the palatinate. If there was any legal doubt of the bi&s;hop's not being fully inve&s;ted with <HI>jura regalia</HI> within the wapentake of Sadberge, in which Greatham lies, then, to cure the defect, the grant from Peter the grand&s;on was a judicious mea&s;ure; and it &s;eems as if &s;ome &s;uch doubt had then ari&s;en. The bi&s;hop being quieted in this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, founded an ho&s;pital at Greatham, which he dedicated to God, the ble&s;&s;ed Mary, and St Cuthbert, wherein he placed a ma&s;ter, five prie&s;ts, two clerks, and forty indigent people; and, for the maintenance thereof, granted the manor, with its appendages, together with the advow&s;on of the church, which he exempted from all charges. He al&s;o publi&s;hed an indulgence of forty days to &s;uch as &s;hould contribute thereto.

<P>The year &s;ucceeding Edward's coronation proved fatal to the queen of Scotland; on who&s;e death the amicable principles, which had long been maintained between the two kingdoms, were much infringed, and the borderers began to renew their acts of violence, which occa&s;ioned the king of Scotland, in the following year, to complain of the exce&s;&s;es committed by the officers of the crown of England on the
<PB N="225" REF="272">marches<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, v. ii. p. 1064, &amp;c.</NOTE>; on which errand envoys were &s;ent from the court of Scotland.

To refute this complaint, the king of Scotland &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Edward, viz. the bi&s;hops of St Andrew's and Dumblane, Robert de Brus earl of Carrick, and Rich|ard de Stratun, who avouched, in the name of their &s;overeign, that no encroach|ments had been made on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the bi&s;hopric; but, in order to an ami|cable adju&s;tment, propo&s;ed that the charge &s;hould be referred to men of knowledge, cho&s;en by each party, agreeable to the laws of the march; and added, they were commanded by the king their ma&s;ter to reque&s;t him, as a brother and ally, not to give ear to any per&s;on who &s;ought to di&s;turb him in his rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which he and his ance&s;tors had &s;o long enjoyed.</P>
<P>Alexander king of Scotland did his homage to the king of England, in the pre|&s;ence of the Engli&s;h parliament, at the palace of We&s;tmin&s;ter; and the matter in di&s;pute between him and the bi&s;hop was brought before the &s;ame parliament, and afterwards heard, by Edward and his council, in the pre&s;ence of delegates a&s;&s;igned by the king of Scotland for that purpo&s;e, when &s;ome articles were agreed on for terminating that &s;uit. But, in order to a final determination, the pre&s;ence of pro|per parties was nece&s;&s;ary upon the ground in que&s;tion, to judge with preci&s;ion on the nature of the bi&s;hop's complaint: To this end the king appointed the bi&s;hop of Norwich, John de Ve&s;ey, Rob. de Scardeburg, and Thomas de Normanville, to repair to places in Northumberland contiguous to the di&s;puted lands, and there hear, reform, and terminate the matter, according to what was concluded and agreed in the Engli&s;h parliament and council, and as to their own di&s;cretion &s;hould &s;eem ju&s;t.

But the king of England's commi&s;&s;ion not giving liberty for any negociation, but being a po&s;itive power to determine &s;ingly, it is probable the Scots would remon|&s;trate again&s;t &s;o arbitrary a mode, which implied an entire &s;overeignty in the king of England; and, indeed, it appears evident that king Edward was then conceiv|ing a plan of that tendency, to which he was encouraged by his &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t Wales.

<P>The chief glory of this part of Edward's reign was the &s;alutary &s;tatute of Mort|main, whereby all per&s;ons were forbid to di&s;po&s;e of their e&s;tates to &s;ocieties which never die, without the king's expre&s;s con&s;ent. The See of Durham, among others, was affected thereby; but the diminution of a power which had already increa&s;ed to an incredible height, as will be &s;hewn in the &s;ucceeding prelate's life, and which threatened the &s;tate with little le&s;s than di&s;&s;olution had it proceeded, was one of the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures of this illu&s;trious reign. The &s;overeign had a com|petent apprehen&s;ion of the danger impending over the &s;tate, if a &s;peedy &s;top was not put to the enormous growth of church po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. It was demon&s;trated to him, that, in proce&s;s of time, all the lands of the kingdom would be in the hands of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, if people were &s;till &s;uffered to alienate their effects to the church, which, never dying, always acquiring, and never alienating, di&s;covered, to com|mon ob&s;ervation, a con&s;equence of the mo&s;t alarming nature; to remedy which
<PB N="227" REF="274">this &s;tatute was devi&s;ed, and received by the people with infinite joy, whereby e&s;tates were prevented falling into hands, in a temporal &s;en&s;e, of no &s;ervice to the king and the public. As perfection is not permitted to ble&s;s human life, the next remarkable &s;tatute of this reign had its evil con&s;equences, though founded on ju&s;t and noble principles, called the &s;tatute of <HI>Quo warranto,</HI> which enabled the crown to enquire into the exerci&s;e of franchi&s;es and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of e&s;tates, where the o&s;ten&s;ible party was &s;u&s;pected of injurious u&s;urpation. But this &s;ubject has no im|mediate relation to the hi&s;tory of this province, in which is no record of our bi|&s;hop's exerci&s;e of the powers of that &s;tatute, or of the king's, till the time of the &s;ucceeding bi&s;hop. The reduction of Wales, and the extinction of the royal race of that principality, fully occupied the remaining part of the period of our prelate's life; an uninterrupted peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ting with Scotland.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop appropriated the church of Middleham to Finchale priory, in aug|mentation of &s;ix monks. He gave the advow&s;on of the church of Meldon to the prior and convent of Durham, receiving in exchange the entire pre&s;entation to Waldene&s;tow church, in Lincoln dioce&s;e, to which the bi&s;hop and prior u&s;ed to pre&s;ent by turns. He granted to the prior and convent of Durham, free warren and woods in Billingham&s;hire. Having treated of more important matters, Gray&s;tanes de&s;cends to tho&s;e le&s;s &s;ignificant, and &s;peaks of this bi&s;hop's great filial piety towards his mother; and al&s;o the aver&s;ion he had to drinking beer, which oc|ca&s;ions him to introduce the prelate's apology for his di&s;like, which, as expre&s;&s;ive of his mode&s;ty of mind, may be repeated.

<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to make a retro&s;pection, touching &s;ome events which were previ|ous to this prelate's election, duly to bring forward his public character in the &s;tate to the reader's attention. The royal family of Scotland had &s;u&s;tained a multitude of fatal &s;hocks. Alexander III. in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, lo&s;t his younge&s;t &s;on David; there then remaining to him his elde&s;t &s;on Alexander, and a daughter Margaret, who married Eric king of Norway, but, in le&s;s than two years, departed this life, leaving i&s;&s;ue only one child, called after her mother. The prince royal of Scot|land, &s;oon after the marriage of his fi&s;ter, e&s;pou&s;ed the daughter of the earl of Flanders, but died in the 20th year of his age; &s;o that the royal race was now reduced to the infant prince&s;s of Norway. The king of Scotland, in hopes of further i&s;&s;ue, married Julet daughter of the count de Dreux, a lady of great beauty and &s;ine accompli&s;hment: But the unhappy fatalities de&s;tined for this fa|mily, were not yet compleated. In the en&s;uing &s;pring the king was hilled by a &s;all from his hor&s;e near the town of Kinghorn, leaving no i&s;&s;ue by his queen; on which event, Margaret, the infant prince&s;s of Norway, was declared by the lates next heir to the crown; and a regency was e&s;tabli&s;hed accordingly. The king of England immediately conceived a de&s;ign of uniting the kingdoms; to which end he propo&s;ed a marriage between his &s;on Edward and the prince&s;s Mar|garet, and he obtained the pope's di&s;pen&s;ation, as they were within the prohibited degrees of con&s;anguinity. It appears that the intended marriage was highly ac|ceptable to the &s;tates of Scotland, who, whil&s;t a&s;&s;embled at Brigham on Tweed, a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al by their letter to the king, &s;igned by 12 bi&s;hops, 12 carls, 23 abbots, 11 priors, and 50 barons. All the regents were included in the num|ber
<PB N="230" REF="277">of &s;ub&s;cribers. To negociate this matter with Eric king of Norway, the bi&s;hop of Durham, with Henry de Newark dean of York, John earl Warren, and Robert bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, were appointed by the king's commi&s;&s;ion, with powers to contract marriage between the parties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 398.

The &s;tates a&s;&s;embled at Brigham made certain requi&s;itions to the king relative to the &s;tate of their country, which the king, by his commi&s;&s;ion to the bi&s;hop of Durham, Ralph bi&s;hop of carli&s;le, the earls of Warren and Lincoln, William Ve&s;cy of Alnwick, knight, and Henry Newark dean of York, impowered them fully to an&s;wer, who met the e&s;tates in the middle of July following, 1290, and &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ented, in their &s;overeign's name, to every matter required on the behalf of Scotland, and the &s;ame were ra|tified in due time by the king.</P>

Edward and his de&s;cendents would of their ambition than any other. The inward peace of the i&s;land would have been &s;ecured, and tho&s;e cruel and repeated warfares prevented, which had &s;o often embrued the frontiers of both kingdoms in blood, and rendered them monuments to po&s;terity of the mo&s;t brutal cruelties and acts of &s;avage inhumanity. But the hour which Providence had marked for &s;o happy an event was yet at a great di&s;|tance:
<PB N="231" REF="278">The flattering hopes of both nations were at once cru&s;hed by the hand of fate, in the death of the prince&s;s, who breathed her la&s;t in one of the Orkney i&s;lands, as &s;he approached her dominions.</P>
<P>The king of England's impetuous mind could not re&s;ign it&s;elf to this event; he had fixed too earne&s;t an attention on the de&s;ired acqui&s;ition to relinqui&s;h the fa|vourite wi&s;h of encrea&s;ing his dominions by annexing Scotland to his crown. His ambition was rou&s;ed, and his hope was too ardent to be extingui&s;hed by one &s;troke of fate. He formed a re&s;olution to po&s;&s;e&s;s the fir&s;t &s;avourable opportunity for re|ducing the &s;tate by arms. He &s;ore&s;aw that a number of competitors for the crown would appear, as an hereditary claim mu&s;t be deduced from di&s;tant ance&s;try, and therefore lay upon his guard, to act in the de&s;ign as circum&s;tances might ari&s;e conducive to an accompli&s;hment of his project. The war which en&s;ued, and the animo&s;ity created by &s;ucceeding events, were &s;uch, for bitterne&s;s, as had not in any age before that period agitated the two nations. The alarm of the queen's death &s;oon reached the ears of Robert Brus, and he fir&s;t appeared a claimant of the crown at a convention held at Perth, &s;upported by many friends, among whom were the earls of Mar and Athol. A civil war was fore&s;een on every hand; and me&s;&s;engers were di&s;patched to the king of England reque&s;ting him to draw near the frontiers, to overawe the various claimants, who began to grow tumultuous in every quarter, and prevent the effu&s;ion of blood.</P>
<P>Edward, whatever was his title, a&s;&s;umed the office of arbiter touching the claims to the crown of Scotland, and, as &s;overeign or &s;upreme lord of that &s;tate, pro|ceeded to determine the &s;ame. In a letter he wrote to the pope on this &s;ubject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ford. l. ii. c. 42.</NOTE>, after the Lincoln parliament (A. D. 1301), he affirms, that divers per&s;ons con|tending for the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to that crown, applied to him with various reque&s;ts, to do ju&s;tice towards them in the matter. To which the Scots council replied, that the king of England a&s;&s;umed the lamb-like appearance <HI>(&s;ub agnino vellere)</HI> of a conciliator among the contending Scots, not being invited thereto, but had cunningly allured to his intere&s;t &s;ome of the nobles of Scotland, who adhered to a party, having no ju&s;t title to the crown, and re&s;t not being able to refi&s;t him, he u&s;urped the guardian&s;hip of the kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 53. &amp; 54, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The king is charged with perplexing the di&s;pute, by multiplying the number of competitors, who were advanced to twelve, though only the titles of Brus and Baliol, when they came to be deduced, were of real importance. The king was delayed entering on the duty of arbiter by the death of his queen, until the &s;pring of the year 1291. He arrived at Darlington about the 16th day of April, and from thence i&s;&s;ued &s;ummons to 57 of his military tenants of the northern counties, among whom are named John de Baliol, Robert de Brus, William de Ve&s;ey, Hugh de Lovall, the lady de Ros, Margare$ de Ros, and William de Heron, to accompany him with hor&s;e and arms, and all the &s;ervice they owed him, at Norham, for &s;ix weeks, reckoning from Ea&s;ter; and the &s;heriffs of the northern counties received onders to give notice to all within their di&s;tricts, who owed the king military &s;ervice, to give the &s;ame at|tendance
<PB N="232" REF="279"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rym. v. ii. &s;o. 525.</NOTE> At the a&s;&s;embly convened at Norham, the bi&s;hop of Durham ad|dre&s;&s;ed the &s;tates of Scotland<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 489.</NOTE> in the name of the &s;overeign, informing them, That the purpo&s;e of his coming to the borders was, in quality of direct and &s;u|preme lord of Scotland, to maintain the tranquillity of that kingdom, and to do impartial ju&s;tice to tho&s;e who claimed the crown; but, the more effectually to ac|compli&s;h this purpo&s;e, he required, <HI>ex abundanti,</HI> of the Scots who were pre&s;ent, their a&s;&s;ent to, and recognition of his &s;overeignty, not intending to act in this mat|ter without their council; and that the king gave them three weeks, from the tenth day of May, to deliberate thereon, and in that time to procure &s;uch documents as they might chu&s;e to produce to invalidate his title to that dignity, if any &s;uch they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the day appointed, eight of the competitors appeared; John Baliol, by one Randolf his knight, prayed a re&s;pite till the next day, and then appearing, all the claimants made a full recognition of king Edward's title (Pinkney only excepted), by an in&s;trument under their &s;eals, which was followed by a written grant of the whole territory and ca&s;tles of Scotland, to enable the king to give &s;ei&s;in to the per|&s;on who&s;e claim &s;hould be confirmed. Thus circum&s;tanced, it would not have been wondered at, if every degree of partiality had been extended in favour of him who made the mo&s;t abject promi&s;es of dependence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the arbi|ter inve&s;ted with &s;uch authorities. But Edward, on a fair inve&s;tigation of his con|duct, &s;tands clear of &s;uch an imputation: He exhibited, in the conclu&s;ion of this momentous bu&s;ine&s;s, a &s;pecimen of that deliberation and &s;olemnity with which important que&s;tions of right ought to be examined and tried. Berwick was agreed upon as the place where each competitor &s;hould produce the evidence to maintain his claim, and the &s;econd day of Augu&s;t en&s;uing was appointed for that purpo&s;e. The claims were then pre&s;ented, and the &s;econd day of June, in the following year, was named for the king's giving judgment thereon. But, various new cir|cum&s;tances ari&s;ing that day, an adjournment was agreed upon, and it was not till the 17th day of November, A. D. 1292, that a determination was made in favour of Baliol. Fordun attempts to impeach the king's candour, and tells us, that the king, finding the council inclining to give the preference to Bruce, and advi&s;ing with &s;ome of his confidants concerning the matter, the bi&s;hop of Durham remind|ed him of Bruce's great family and connections in England, and how formidable he would be there, if advanced to the throne of Scotland, who&s;e kings had for|merly been &s;o trouble&s;ome to this nation. On which Edward replied, <HI>Par le &s;ang de Dieu vous avez bien e&s;chante;</HI> the matter &s;hall go otherwi&s;e than I at fir&s;t in|tended<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fordun al&s;o relates, that after &s;entence was given for Baliol, the earl of Glouce&s;ter, the nephew of Brus's wife, t$king Brus by the hand, bid the king con&s;ider what kind of judgment he had that day given, and remember, that he him&s;elf &s;hould be judged at the la&s;t day. He adds, that Robert, by command of the &s;ame earl, immediately retired, and never paid fealty or homage to Baliol. According to an extract in Leland's Collection, v. ii. p. 539. John de Warren earl of Surry, father-in-law to John Baliol, joined with Anthony Bek bi&s;hop of Durham in maintenance of Baliol's title.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I am ignorant of the exact date of the proce&s;s under the <HI>quo warranto</HI> &s;tatute again&s;t the liberties of this palatinate; but, by a record in the Tower of London,
<PB N="233" REF="280">of the 9th of K. Ed. I. A. D. 1281, it appears that the bi&s;hop of Durham's liber|ties were allowed before John de Vallibus and his fellow-ju&s;tices itinerant in the county of Northumberland: And<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spearman's Enquiry, p. 8.</NOTE>, by a record in the parliament of the 21&s;t of Edw. I. 1293, it appears, that an inqui&s;ition was taken touching tho&s;e liberties before Hugh de Cre&s;&s;ingham, and his fellow-ju&s;tices, at Newca&s;tle-upon-Tyne. The mode of proceeding under this &s;tatute was, that the king i&s;&s;ued his proclamation, en|joining all per&s;ons holding lands of the crown to lay their titles before the judges of the realm: And by the proceedings of the commi&s;&s;ioners it appears, that they cau&s;ed proclamation to be made according to the form of the &s;tatute of Glouce&s;ter, and that neither the bi&s;hop of Durham, or tho&s;e claiming liberties within his pala|tinate, came forth to ju&s;tify their title; on which default, the &s;ame liberties were &s;eized into the king's hands, until they &s;hould be relieved, and tho&s;e claiming &s;hould an&s;wer to the king touching their right thereto. Tho&s;e proclamations were looked upon as the &s;ource of a very great grievance; and indeed the per&s;ons who were fir&s;t attacked, and could not produce their original titles, though they proved a long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, were forced to pay large &s;ums to the king to pre&s;erve their e&s;tates. This kind of oppre&s;&s;ion would have gone much further, had not a &s;top been put to it by the earl of Warren, who, appearing before the judges, was required to &s;hew the fundamental title by virtue whereof he held his lands: He an&s;wered by drawing an old ru&s;ty &s;word out of the &s;cabbard, and &s;aying to the judges, <Q>This is the in&s;trument by which my ance&s;tors gained their e&s;tate, and by &startq;this I will keep it as long as I live. King William did not conquer for him&s;elf &endq;alone, neither did my forefather a&s;&s;i&s;t him for that end.</Q> So bold an an&s;wer &s;eemed likely to involve the earl in trouble, but it had quite a contrary effect. The king found by it how difficult it would be to exact from the nobility, upon &s;o frivolous a pretence, the &s;ums he expected, without falling into great inconveni|ence. He &s;aw plainly there were &s;till, among the barons, per&s;ons as ready to hazard all in defence of their rights and properties as tho&s;e in the time of king John and king Henry III. Tho&s;e con&s;iderations inducing him to revoke his proclama|tion, the people expre&s;&s;ed their joy in &s;uch a manner, as plainly &s;hewed how much they dete&s;ted this oppre&s;&s;ion. But to return to the matter relative to the liberties of this palatinate, it appears by the before-mentioned record, that the bi&s;hop, ha|ving pleaded in parliament various matters, as well in error as otherwi&s;e, had full re&s;titution of his liberties. The articles in the inqui&s;ition mo&s;t worthy the reader's attention, are, That the bi&s;hops of Durham, by their bailiffs, u&s;ed to meet the king's ju&s;tices in their progre&s;s at Chilewell, or Four&s;tanes, or Quakenbrigge, as it might happen which way they travelled, and attended them to Newca&s;tle, to ob|tain from them the articles of the pleas of the crown, there to be enquired of.</P>
<P>That the bi&s;hop of Durham had his chancery, and by his writs, and proper ju&s;|tices, held all pleas within his liberties of Durham, Sadberge, and Bedlington, on this &s;ide Coket, and Norham, beyond Coket, all within the precincts of his
<PB N="234" REF="281">county. That he had his mintage at Durham; had his coroners; three in the three wards of Durham, one at Sadberge, one at Bedlington, and another at Norham. That after the commi&s;&s;ion under which the king's ju&s;tices acted was clo&s;ed, the bi&s;hop, by his ju&s;tices, might hold all pleas, as well of the crown as others, with|in his liberties. That he had his place of execution at Durham and Norham, where he had the cu&s;tom of Infangenetheof and Outfangenetheof. That he had fairs and markets at Durham, Darlington, and Norham. That at Norham he held all pleas of the crown, from fifteen days to fifteen days, or from three weeks to three weeks, at his plea&s;ure. That he held in exigent and outlawry, with power of pardoning his outlaws. That the bi&s;hop had lately relieved the warren at Tweedmouth, where no ancient warren was; but people, by his permi&s;&s;ion, u&s;ed to enjoy the liberty of chace. That the bi&s;hop grants warrenage, as his plea&s;ure is, to tho&s;e within his liberties. That his bailiffs &s;tay all per&s;ons on the bridge of Berwick bringing wool, hides, or &s;kins, to be &s;old, not having the Coket mark thereon, and &s;eize &s;uch wares to the bi&s;hop's u&s;e, as forfeitures.</P>
<P>Divers nobles, and others, within the palatinate, enjoy &s;undry liberties; as the prior of Durham hath infangenetheof within all his territories, a moiety of the goods of felons condemned in his courts, &amp;c. a&s;&s;ize of bread and other provi|&s;ions in Elmete<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elvet.</NOTE>, and a moiety of all wreck of the &s;ea, &amp;c.</P>
<P>John king of Scotland, at Ca&s;tle Barnard, hath his markets and fairs, pillory and tumbrell, place of execution and infangenetheof, with the goods of felons condemned in his courts, &amp;c. and hath free chace and free warren in all his lands within the liberties of the bi&s;hopric.</P>
<P>Agnes of Valencia hath her place of execution and infangenetheof at Gainford, within the liberties of the bi&s;hopric, and takes the goods of felons, &amp;c. and has free warren in her lands.</P>
<P>Robert de Brus hath, at Hartlepool, market and fair, a&s;&s;ize of bread and vic|tuals, and all privileges appertaining to markets and fairs; al&s;o a &s;ea-port, where he takes keel-dues, viz. for every &s;hip, with a boat, which plies there, 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and for every &s;hip, without a boat, 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and he al&s;o takes there, prize of fi&s;h, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ralph de Neville hath free chace and free warren at Brancepeth.</P>
<P>Robert de Hilton, Wychard de Charum, John Marmeduk, Henry de In&s;ula, Walter de Wy&s;&s;ingdon, and John de Guldeford, have warren in all their lands. John de Gray&s;tok has at Cunoi&s;chyne (Con&s;cliff) a place of execution and in|fangenetheof, goods and chattels of felons, and free warren in all his lands.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop hath privilege, by his bailiff, to take the cu&s;tody of any man of his palatinate, who is apprehended in Northumberland, at the &s;uit of any one within his bi&s;hopric, in order to have him at a place called Holdenburn, on the march between Norham and the body of the county, where he &s;hall &s;uffer the law; with the like privilege for the &s;heriff of Northumberland, where an offender is taken in Norham&s;hire.</P>

<P>It is evident, from the whole tenor of Edward's conduct in the management of the great affair of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Scotland, and in his proceedings after the coronation of Baliol, that he had ince&s;&s;antly in view a de&s;ign of reducing that kingdom to his entire &s;ubjection. His deci&s;ion touching the claims of the competitors was impartial, and con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of tho&s;e claims, in that he held forth a character clear of reproach: To have acted otherwi&s;e would have alarmed the &s;tates, thrown them upon their guard, and in the end de&s;troyed the great de&s;ign in its very embryo. On the other hand, he knew well the ferocious minds of di&s;appointed Scot&s;men did not &s;uffer re&s;entment to &s;ub&s;ide un&s;atiated: Many were affected by the deci&s;ion in Baliol's favour, and few were reconciled to it; like hidden fire, the combu&s;tion was left to gather in &s;ecret more vehemence from its re&s;traint. The king had obtained the grounds which were to &s;upport his &s;ecret purpo&s;e; and his proceedings, after the deci&s;ion, had a manife&s;t tendency either to train Baliol and his &s;ubjects into a &s;ervile dependence on England, or to provoke the nation to revolt, which &s;hould give him an immediate pretext for le|vying war, and reducing Scotland to a &s;imilar &s;tate with Wales; and he could not doubt but, by pur&s;uing &s;imilar mea&s;ures, he would attain the &s;ame conclu|&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Adjornatio Regis Scotiae &s;uper in&s;titia epi&s;copo Dunelmen&s;i exhibenda.&mdash;Rymer's Foedera, v. ii. p. 632.&mdash;Rot.

Prynn, v. iii. p. 556.</NOTE> The various &s;ummons he &s;ent to the king of Scotland, on the mo&s;t frivo|lous appeals, explained to him the idea the king of England had entertained of the &s;ervility and va&s;&s;alage under which he held his crown. Irritated by repeated in&s;ults, derogatory to the honour of a prince reigning over a people of &s;o martial a &s;pirit, Baliol determined to &s;hake off his dependence, and make an alliance with the French king, by contracting Edward his &s;on and heir with the neice of that potentate. This negociation could not long remain a &s;ecret at the Engli&s;h court, which being attended with various in&s;tances of Baliol's public contempt of the king's mandates, and coupled with the in&s;olence and outrages repeatedly commit|ted by the Scots on the borders, brought on a mo&s;t bloody and inveterate war.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t capital breach of the peace which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two nations
<PB N="239" REF="286">was committed by the Scots garri&s;on of Berwick, plundering and burning &s;everal Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els which entered that port, giving no quarter to the mariners; and an open war &s;oon after was denounced on the part of Edward, by his &s;eizing on the Engli&s;h e&s;tates of Baliol, and others of the Scots nation who did not immedi|ately come over to his dependence. Edward came down to Newca&s;tle in the month of March 1296, with an army of 30,000 foot, and 4,000 gens d'arms or heavy armed hor&s;emen; together with the &s;orces of the bi&s;hop of Durham, con&s;i&s;ting of 1000 foot and 500 hor&s;e: The&s;e troops of the prelate's, it is &s;aid, were not the inilitary tenants of his palatinate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert de Gray&s;tanes tells us he had of his own family twenty-&s;ix &s;tandard-beares; and add$, that $e $eo$ed more like a lay prince than a prie&s;t or bi&s;hop.</NOTE>, but Wel&s;h and Iri&s;h mercenaries; the people of the bi&s;hopric claiming a privilege, as <HI>halywerk-folk,</HI> of not departing the limits of the juri&s;diction, being only guards of the body and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of St Cuthbert.

Gray&s;tances, who&s;e authority is mo&s;t to be depended on, as being re&s;ident in the palatinate, &s;ays, that bi&s;hop Bek was a mo&s;t magnificent prelate, living in a degree of &s;plendor inferior to none but his &s;overeign, and only exceeded by the king in his military actions, &s;kill, and power; that he was more a&s;&s;iduous about affairs of government than in the execution of his epi&s;copal function. In warfare he was a powerful a&s;&s;ociate to the king, and in council &s;age and circum&s;pect.

It is al&s;o &s;aid, that the banner of St Cuthbert was moved from the &s;hrine in the church at Durham to attend the army; on which occa&s;ion the king granted to that church 40 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year out of the royal exchequer at Berwick, until &s;ome appropriation &s;hould be made of equal value out of the churches of Scotland. The expenditure of this yearly &s;um was directed by the king to be in alms, and for the maintenance of a &s;olemn fe&s;tival of the monks on the two anniver&s;aries of their tutelary &s;aint, &s;up|port a ma&s;s-prie&s;t, and furni&s;h wax-lights to burn before the &s;hrine and banner whil&s;t ma&s;s was celebrating<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rym. v. ii. p. 730.</NOTE>.

<P>The king of Scotland was &s;ummoned to appear at Newca&s;tle, to an&s;wer the charges of di&s;obedience, and for the outrages committed by his &s;ubjects, but he paid no attention thereto; on which the army moved to Bambrough. The fir&s;t acts of ho&s;tility were made at Wark, where, on the defection of Robert de Ro&s;s, a detachment of 1000 men from the Engli&s;h army, which marched to &s;eize that fortre&s;s, on its being evacuated by Ro&s;s's people who went over to the Scots, were &s;et upon in the night, and mo&s;t of them put to the &s;word. King Edward is &s;aid to have given thanks to God that this occa&s;ion fully authori&s;ed his un&s;heath|ing the &s;word, and exculpated his con&s;cience of the con&s;equences to en&s;ue. On the Wedne&s;day after Ea&s;ter he entered Scotland with his main army, by fording the river Tweed below the nunnery at Cold&s;tream; and on the &s;ame day the bi|&s;hop of Durham led his forces over the river at the ford near Norham.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the king lay at Berwick, on the 5th of April, he received, from Blount and others Baliol's commi&s;&s;ioners, his renunciation of homage and obedience to the crown of England. Various &s;cenes of blood&s;hed en&s;ued. The defeat at Dun|bar was a fatal blow to the Scots; almo&s;t all the fighting men fled beyond the Frith of Forth. Robert Brus earl of Carrick was, by a commi&s;&s;ion given him at Roxburgh, empowered to receive to the king's peace the inhabitants of Annan|dale; and his &s;on had the like commi&s;&s;ion for the county of Carrick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;h. p. 307.

But that valliant knight the lord Ralph Ba&s;&s;ett of Draiton, &s;aid to him, "My lord, you may goe and &s;ay ma&s;&s;e, which better becometh you than to teach us what we have to do; for we will doe that which belongeth to the order and cu&s;tom of war," &amp;c.</NOTE>. The king of England, having received great reinforcements from Wales and Ireland, re|duced the whole country in his progre&s;s to Perth: Whil&s;t he remained there to celebrate the fe&s;tival of St John Bapti&s;t, he received me&s;&s;engers from Baliol, im|ploring peace. The bi&s;hop of Durham, on the part of the king of England, was empowered to negociate this matter, and accordingly met the king of Scotland and &s;ome of his principal nobility at the Ca&s;tle of Brecken; where the unhappy monarch could obtain no better terms than an ab&s;olute re&s;ignation of his kingdom, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf and nobles to the will of the king of England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rym. p. 718.</NOTE>; on which Baliol's elde&s;t &s;on was delivered up as an ho&s;tage, and he and his father were afterwards &s;ent to London, where they continued three years clo&s;e pri&s;oners. The king moved his army northwards as far as Aberdeen, the bi&s;hop of Durham, du|ring the whole progre&s;s, with his provincial troops forming the van, and proceed|ing a day's march before the main body. The king removed the <HI>palladium</HI> of Scot|land to We&s;tmin&s;ter, the chair of Scone, u&s;ed for the inauguration of the &s;overeign, which is &s;aid to have in its con&s;truction the &s;tone on which Jacob &s;lept when he had his beati&s;ic vi&s;ion. He al&s;o removed or de&s;troyed all the royal records of the kingdom, and every monument which related to the ancient honours of that na|tion. He &s;ummoned a parliament at Berwick, where he received the &s;ubmi&s;tion of the Scotti&s;h &s;tates; and there appointed John de Warren earl of Surrey guar|dian,

The whole has the appearance of a forgery.</P>
<P>It was not long before the Scots made a &s;truggle to &s;hake off the intolerable yoke, with which they were burthened, under Edward's vicegerents. Warren, the guardian, advanced in years, thought the air of Scotland prejudicial to his health, and therefore took up his re&s;idence in the northern parts of England. Cre&s;&s;ing|ham, the trea&s;urer, be&s;ides his overbearing pride and in&s;olence, was charged with a mercile&s;s rapaciou&s;ne&s;s. Orme&s;by, the ju&s;ticiary, was rigid, intolerably impe|rious and tyrannical, adjudging to exile all tho&s;e who refu&s;ed the oath of fealty to the king of England. The weak &s;tate of Scotland encouraged tho&s;e who ruled there to commit the mo&s;t enormous exce&s;&s;es. At length a patriot leader aro&s;e called Wallace, not of eminent degree by birth, but by his uncommon genius, fortitude, and virtue. His &s;tature and &s;trength are de&s;cribed as gigantic, his a&s;pect and addre&s;s plea&s;ing and popular; and he was equally renowned for &s;ubtlety in devi&s;ing military &s;tratagems, as for his prowe&s;s in conducting the mo&s;t perilous at|chievements. He had acquired a martial &s;ame by his depredations on the Engli&s;h borders, in his youth, having the command of a banditti of outlaws. Infinite trouble en&s;ued to the king from the in&s;urrections headed by this leader, who was joined by many powerful parties, particularly Robert Brus, the younger, earl of Carrick, James Stewart of Scotland, and others of that intere&s;t. The bi&s;hop of Durham being &s;ent to enquire the circum&s;tances of the&s;e new di&s;turbances, gave the king full information of the danger threatened by this formidable in&s;urrection; on which occa&s;ion he i&s;&s;ued orders for all the military men north of Trent to join earl Warren, and proceed to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion. The king pa&s;&s;ed over into Flanders on his continental affairs, and left the troops ordered to advance again&s;t Scotland to the conduct of Warren and Cre&s;&s;ingham, again&s;t who&s;e unhappy com|mand the in&s;urgents every where prevailed: They took the town of Berwick, over-ran Northumberland, and prepared to be&s;iege Durham, when a dreadful &s;torm en&s;ued, in which many of the Scots peri&s;hed by hunger and cold. This event was attributed, by the &s;uper&s;titious writers of tho&s;e days, to the mediation of St Cuthbert with the powers of the air, to protect his church. The Scotti&s;h forces retreated, but in their way burnt Ryton, laying wa&s;te the country in their rout, as they returned to their own territories laden with &s;poils.</P>
<P>The barons of England, with the clergy, who refu&s;ed to grant the aids required by the king, and to attend him on his expedition to Flanders, now made a formi|dable head in the affairs of &s;tate; and, taking advantage of the pre&s;ent exigence, in&s;i&s;ted upon having a general pardon from the regent, and a ratification of the
<PB N="242" REF="289">great charter, and charter of the fore&s;ts, together with a mo&s;t valuable adage, <Q>&startq;That no talliage, or aid, &s;hould thenceforth be impo&s;ed on the kingdom, with|out the a&s;&s;ent of the full legi&s;lative body, the prelates, nobles, knights, bur|ge&s;&s;es, &endq;and other free men;</Q> and, on condition that the king &s;hould confirm the &s;ame, they con&s;ented, both clergy and laity, to grant the nece&s;&s;ary aids for the Scotti&s;h war. The king &s;ubmitted, but with evident marks of reluctance, to the terms propo&s;ed; and an army was &s;oon after mu&s;tered at Newca&s;tle for the Scot|ti&s;h expedition. The king having obtained a two years truce in Flanders, ha&s;tened home to conduct this armament, and arrived at Berwick in the middle of March 1298. The barons who were in the combination before mentioned, before they would enter Scotland, in&s;i&s;ted on the king's ratifying his confirmation of the terms exacted from the regent in his ab&s;ence, jealous he would attempt to evade a con&s;ent made in a foreign country; on which the bi&s;hop of Durham, together with the earls Warren, Glouce&s;ter, and Lincoln, were authori&s;ed to &s;wear, upon the king's &s;oul, that, on his returning victorious, he would give his people ample &s;atisfaction in the matter; and, &s;oon after, en&s;ued the victorious battle of Falkirk, at which, according to the Scala Chronica before referred to, the bi&s;hop of Durham had &s;uch a retinue, "that in hys cumpany were 32 baners." After the king had pur&s;ued the favourable con&s;equences of the defeat in this battle, he moved &s;outhward as far as Durham, where he halted &s;ome time; but hearing the Scots were again appear|ing in force, he returned to Tynemouth, where he remained till Chri&s;tmas, and then took his rout for the fouth. In the truce made by the king in Flanders, it was &s;tipulated, that John Baliol &s;hould be &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>The affairs of Scotland were for a while &s;u&s;pended, by a claim made by the pope of the &s;overeign right over that kingdom, &s;ugge&s;ting, that it was a fief of the holy See. A parliament was &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;emble in the month of January A. D. 1301, to con&s;ider this a&s;toni&s;hing claim, and a mandate i&s;&s;ued to command all religious hou&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 885.&mdash; Ibid. to the prior and convent of Durham.</NOTE>, and other &s;ocieties, to make &s;earch in their records for evidence touching the matter. The re&s;ult was, an expre&s;s declaration of the barons, that they, as guardians of the rights of the crown, would never permit their king to an&s;wer ju|dicially before the pope touching any of tho&s;e rights. After this explicit an&s;wer, the Engli&s;h arms carried with them victory wherever they pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The metropolitan See of York had commenced a claim of juri&s;diction over the See of Durham which could not ea&s;ily be renounced. The death of archbi&s;hop William did only occa&s;ion the di&s;pute to &s;ub&s;ide a little; for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, John Romaine, &s;ome few years after his acce&s;&s;ion, and whil&s;t bi&s;hop Bek was attending the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, and then accompanying the king on the northern borders about the affairs of Scotland, &s;ent to Durham, by the pope's authority, John de Emelye his notary-public, and William de Wilton of Pickering<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the record, called J. de Aurelia, and W. de Worlton. dict. de Pyke.</NOTE>, his clerks, with official letters of citation, and canonical mandates. John de Mayden&s;tan con&s;table of the Ca&s;tle of Durham, and others the bi&s;hop's officers there, e&s;teeming this an intru&s;ion on the privileges of the See, impri&s;oned the me&s;&s;engers in the Ca&s;tle of
<PB N="243" REF="290">Durham, and there held them in clo&s;e durance until the bi&s;hop's in&s;tructions could be obtained, who approved the conduct of his officers, and ordered the pri&s;oners to be detained, in defiance of &s;everal admonitions &s;ent him in writing by the arch|bi&s;hop to enlarge them; on which the archbi&s;hop thundered out a &s;entence of in|terdict again&s;t him for not relea&s;ing them, <Q>contrary to his canonical obedience, &startq;to the peril of his &s;oul, and the great injury, high contempt, and attenuation of his archiepi&s;copal authority, church, and religion; and for refu&s;ing to give any competent &s;atisfaction for tho&s;e contempts, after the parties were relea&s;ed by proce&s;s out of the king's &s;ecular courts, he i&s;&s;ued his precept to the prior of Boulton to excommunicate the bi&s;hop of Durham in the churches of Allerton &endq;and Darlington, and other places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 456.</NOTE>.</Q> The prior accordingly publi&s;hed his ex|communication, according to the mandate, which occa&s;ioned a complaint to come before parliament in the en&s;uing year.

Secondly, The archbi&s;hop's high offence again&s;t the king's crown and dignity, in pre&s;uming to enforce the bi&s;hop and them to relea&s;e his impri&s;oned clerks by his own eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures of interdict and excommunication, not by the king's proce&s;&s;e and authority, according to the law and cu&s;tom of the realm.

Fourthly, That for any archbi&s;hop or prelate to excommunicate any per&s;on in the king's &s;ervice, or attending on his royal per&s;on by his com|mand, and under his protection, or any other, for temporal affairs, is a very high contempt, offence again&s;t the king's crown and dignity, tending to the king's and his heirs di&s;inheriting, by the unanimous re&s;olution of the king, and of all his nobles, barons, judges, council, in this parliament; which they adjudged to be puni&s;hed not only then, but in all &s;ucceeding ages, by impri&s;onment of the per&s;ons of &s;uch archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, and others, who &s;hould be found guilty thereof, and al&s;o by great fines and ran&s;oms to the king. Fifthly, That this archbi&s;hop was then adjudged to be committed pri&s;oner to the tower, notwith|&s;tanding his pall; and enforced to enter into a recognizance, with &s;ureties, to
<PB N="244" REF="291">pay a &s;ine of 4000 marks to the king, notwith&s;tanding his in&s;i&s;ting on his archi|epi&s;copal privileges, and the nobles mediation on his behalf: A great &s;um in &endq;that age.</Q></P>
<P>The bi&s;hop, among&s;t his other qualities, had an unbounded arrogance of mind: He attempted to break in upon the privileges of the convent, which he wi&s;hed to govern as his caprice or pride might dictate. He obtained the re&s;ignation of prior Richard de Claxton by his &s;ubtlety, and appointed Henry de Hornca&s;tre guardian of the church, until a prior was elected, contrary to the u&s;age of the convent, it being the &s;ub-prior's duty. Hugh de Derlington, formerly prior, was appointed; and the re&s;igning prior had a&s;&s;igned to him, for maintenance, the cell of Were|mouth, with the tithes of the vill of Sudwick. Prior Hugh re&s;igned, and, in the &s;pring of the year 1299, Richard de Hotoun was elected to that office. In the year 1300, various di&s;&s;entions began between the bi&s;hop and prior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Gray&s;tan$s. &mdash;Ang. Sac. p. 748, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The prior was accu&s;ed of great irregularities, touching the lands of Coldingham&s;hire; and the bi&s;hop was required, by &s;everal, to vi&s;it the convent, and reform the abu&s;es. The formalities in&s;i&s;ted upon, on this occa&s;ion, not being &s;ubmitted to by the bi&s;hop, the prior requiring that he &s;hould vi&s;it alone, he was induced, in the height of re&s;entment, to excommunicate and &s;u&s;pend the prior; he al&s;o pronounced an interdict again&s;t him, and at length a &s;entence of deprivation. The convent on this occa&s;ion was divided: Among tho&s;e on the &s;ide of the bi&s;hop were the priors of Finchale and de In&s;ula. The bi&s;hop, in the next place, de&s;cended to open acts of violence: He entered the park of Beaurepaire, and de&s;troyed the game which abounded therein. The bi&s;hop's &s;ervants committed various outrages again&s;t the prior, impri&s;oned his people, and prevented the nece&s;&s;aries of life being carried in|to the convent. The king, who knew the overbearing and impetuous temper of his bi&s;hop, willing to prevent the di&s;grace &s;uch animo&s;ities and conflicts bring upon religion, interpo&s;ed as a mediator, and, in his journey to Carli&s;le, pa&s;&s;ed a&s;ide to Durham, in order to re&s;tore peace there. He enjoined, that the prior &s;hould con|tinue in his office during life; and that the bi&s;hop, when he vi&s;ited, might be at|tended by three or four of his clergy; and thereupon declared, tha the party who fir&s;t infringed the accommodation he had concluded, &s;hould make him his utter enemy; which he punctually maintained; for the bi&s;hop, &s;oon after, renew|ing his acts of violence, the king took the part of the convent in the warme&s;t man|ner. The di&s;&s;ention of the monks was &s;ucceeded by a breach between the bi&s;hop and his people, no doubt fomented at this time by the influence of the depo&s;ed prior, to encrea&s;e the public odium again&s;t the haughty prelate. The people com|plained, that the bi&s;hop compelled them to attend him with hor&s;e and arms in the war with Scotland, and when &s;ome of them returned home without leave, on the &s;econd campaign, on his return to Durham he ca&s;t them into pri&s;on there. They pleaded, that this was a violation of their liberties and privileges; <Q>that they were &startq;hali-werke &s;olks, (that is, regi&s;tered or enrolled for holy work); that they held their lands by &s;ervice of defending the body and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of St Cuthbert, and
<PB N="245" REF="292">ought not to march out of the confines of their bi&s;hopric, namely, beyond the &endq;Tyne and Tees, in the &s;ervice of their &s;overeign, or bi&s;hop.</Q> The leaders of this di&s;&s;ention were Ra. de Neville and John Marmaduc, to whom were joined the chief part of the military and free tenants of the bi&s;hopric, who brought the complaint before parliament.</P>
<P>Three months after the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and depo&s;ition of the prior, the bi&s;hop con|voked the monks who were in his intere&s;t, and enjoined them to clect a prior, or otherwi&s;e he would appoint one him&s;elf. On their refu&s;al, he named H. de Luce|by prior of Holy I&s;land, to be prior of Durham; and, in order to give him po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, and eject prior Richard, he &s;ent for his fore&s;ters of Weredale and men of Tynedale, who be&s;et the convent, and kept the monks &s;hut up, not permitting provi&s;ions to be carried in: They cut the aqueduct which &s;upplied the hou&s;e with water; forced open the gates of the priory and cloi&s;ter, and &s;o clo&s;ely confined the prior and monks in the church for three days, that they were in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for want of &s;u&s;tenance. At length, on the day of St Bartholomew, &s;ome of the monks, who were the bi&s;hop's adherents, pulled the prior from his &s;eat, and H. de Luceby was immediately in&s;talled; after which the monks profe&s;&s;ed obe|dience, under the influence of &s;uch coercion and terror. Prior Richard was put under confinement, with two monks mo&s;t attached to him. It is &s;aid the new prior accepted the office becau&s;e the bi&s;hop had vowed, on his refu&s;al, to prefer &s;ome foreigner.</P>
<P>Prior Richard, thus in confinement, &s;tudied in what manner he &s;hould effect his e&s;cape; and having obtained permi&s;&s;ion to take the air, with due attendants, he came to Shincliff bridge, where he was met by eight per&s;ons, who led a hor&s;e pro|perly furni&s;hed, and obliged him to mount. On this his guard, in a&s;toni&s;hment, fled to the convent. The prior e&s;caped into Cleveland, where he remained till the parliament met at Lincoln, when he complained of the injuries he had &s;u&s;tained, and then obtained the king's letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 912. Pat. 29th Ed. I. m. 23.</NOTE> for his pa&s;&s;ing to Rome, to lay his grievances before that court. In the &s;ame parliament appeared many per&s;ons of the bi&s;hop|ric on the complaint before mentioned. The king at that a&s;&s;embly was much of|fended with the bi&s;hop; for, a&s;king him whether he &s;tood with him again&s;t the earls Mar&s;hall and Hereford, and the other barons of the realm there met, the bi&s;hop replied, <Q>That tho&s;e per&s;onages were a&s;&s;iduous in the promotion of the ho|nour &startq;and intere&s;t of the king and the realm, therefore he &s;tood with them, and not &endq;with the king again&s;t them.</Q> This noble &s;peech pre&s;erves the bi&s;hop's name to po&s;terity, and ought to have had a more immediate reward in the e&s;teem of good men. It enraged the king again&s;t him, already inclined to be his enemy; he di&s;|&s;embled a reconciliation with the earls, but thenceforth held the bi&s;hop in the great|e&s;t hatred. Bek's &s;ituation and abilities were &s;uch, that it appears as if Edward looked upon him too powerful &s;or a &s;ubject, and, notwith&s;tanding his &s;ervices, &s;ought occa&s;ion to reduce his influence. He is de&s;cribed as the riche&s;t prelate (if we except Wol&s;ey) that ever held the palatinate of Durham; for, be&s;ides the re|venue
<PB N="246" REF="293">of his bi&s;hopric, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a temporal e&s;tate of 5000 marks a-year, pars of which, it is &s;aid, he gained by unju&s;tly converting to his own u&s;e, an e&s;tate which he held in tru&s;t for the natural &s;on of the baron de Ve&s;ey. Camden &s;peaks of this tran&s;action with ju&s;t condemnation, and &s;ays, that William de Ve&s;cy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camden, v. ii. p 912.</NOTE>, who&s;e legitimate &s;on John died in the Wel&s;h wars, gave &s;ome of his lands in Ire|land to king Edward, on condition that his natural &s;on William de Kildare might inherit his e&s;tate, and made our bi&s;hop his feoffee in tru&s;t for the u&s;e of his &s;on, who did not acquit him&s;elf ju&s;tly in this confidence; for he alienated the barony and Ca&s;tle of Alnwick for a large &s;um of money to Henry lord Percy, in who&s;e family they have hitherto remained<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 334.</NOTE>. Eltham was another part of Ve&s;cy's e&s;tate, where the bi&s;hop built an elegant palace, and pre&s;ented it to Edward's con&s;ort. But the&s;e in&s;tances of mi&s;conduct could not &s;o effectually &s;erve to alienate the king's affections: He had filled the highe&s;t tru&s;ts and employments in the &s;tate with character; he rendered the king important &s;ervices in the war, and was not only a man of deep erudition in that age, but al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much per&s;picuity, and a fluent eloquence. By the defection of John Baliol, his large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the territories of Ca&s;tle Barnard, within this juri&s;diction, became forfeited, and were e&s;cheats to the bi&s;hop in right of his See, as were tho&s;e of Robert Brus at Hert, Hertne&s;s, or Hartlepool. The&s;e were important po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and enlarged the powers of the palatine of Durham. The port of Hartlepool, which was Brus's, was part of the forfeiture, and, falling into the bi&s;hop's hands, became a great addition to the importance of this province. The navigation of the river Tyne was partially po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; the bi&s;hop had quays on the &s;outhern &s;hore, and the king on the northern; &s;o that, in &s;uch &s;ituation, the &s;hips of the bi&s;hop were over|awed by the fortre&s;s of Newca&s;tle, and the king's garri&s;on there. The port of Weremouth was not then much u&s;ed, and is hardly mentioned. Indeed, on Mal|colm's expedition, he found, on board &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;els there, Edgar, with his family and adherents, prepared to &s;ail for Scotland. The chief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions there appertained to the religious &s;ociety. Hartlepool was open, and well calculated at once to fit out an armament, as to &s;ecure a fleet, &s;o as to be ready on every emergency: It was of &s;ufficient con&s;equence in bi&s;hop Pud&s;ey's time to receive &s;hips from Flanders, in which he brought 500 foot &s;oldiers, with the knights that garri&s;oned Northallerton Ca&s;tle. The regalia of the bi&s;hop already appeared too great in the eye of Edward for a &s;ubject, and no wonder he &s;hould be de&s;irous of reducing them, and abridging the power of a prelate, of who&s;e &s;trength and capa|city he had received &s;o perfect an example in the Scotti&s;h war. To &s;upport the ap|peal of the bi&s;hop's military tenants, and re&s;train them within the con&s;ines of the palatinate, would, in a capital degree, have e&s;&s;ected his purpo&s;e. Baliol's po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, on the we&s;tern confines of the province, was of great importance in ca&s;es of inte&s;tine broils. The fortre&s;s of Ca&s;tle Barnard had hitherto proved impreg|nable, and it commanded an exten&s;ive tract of country, from whence abundance of &s;upplies in provi&s;ion could be drawn on any emergency; be&s;ides, it was a
<PB N="247" REF="294">bulwark of the highe&s;t importance on any incur&s;ion$ of the Scots. It is not pro|bable the di&s;putes with the convent, or a tre&s;pa&s;s committed again&s;t the liberties of the bi&s;hop's military tenants, which in effect proved &s;o &s;erviceable to the king, would have been e&s;timated in &s;o criminal a degree as they were, had not the king's mind been inclined to &s;eek occa&s;ion for a rupture. He could not &s;o readily have forgot the faithful and valuable &s;ervices he had received from the bi&s;hop, and give up his whole &s;pirit to aver&s;ion and oppre&s;&s;ion, had not &s;ome latent motives influ|enced his mi&s;conduct. The bi&s;hop had 140 knights in his fuite at this parliament.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the depo&s;ed prior's application, the bi&s;hop was &s;ummoned per&s;onally to an&s;wer the charge made again&s;t him, in the court of Rome. He did not obey this &s;ummons, &s;ending proctors thither to an&s;wer for him. His ad|ver&s;ary was graciou&s;ly received by the pope and cardinals; Luceby's nomination was adjudged irregular; and re&s;titution was decreed to the prior. The bi&s;hop's di&s;obedience was next proceeded upon: The pope pronounced his contumacy and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion from epi&s;copal function; and he was then cited to appear at Rome un|der greater penalties. He obeyed this citation, and in his entry into Rome made a mo&s;t &s;plendid parade. He received e&s;pecial marks of favour from the pope, who&s;e ordonance, on his return, he brought with him, confirming his right of vi&s;iting the convent, with two clerks, a notary, and one religious of the &s;ame order. It appears that the bi&s;hop left England, on this journey to Rome, with|out the king's licence; which was imputed to him as an additional offence, and contributed to bring upon him, or at lea&s;t was &s;eized as a pretext for, the &s;everity of pro&s;ecution and wrath of the king, afterwards exerci&s;ed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e encrea&s;ed offences, the king &s;eized the liberties of the palatinate, and appointed Robert de Clifford cu&s;tos thereof, with a &s;tipend of 200 marks a year out of the revenues of the See; William de Orme&s;by ju&s;ticiary, with a &s;tipend of 60 marks per annum; Henry Gilford keeper of the &s;eals; and other officers, turning out the bi&s;hop's chancellor, and tho&s;e of his appointment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pryn$, v. iii. p. 939.</NOTE>. The bi&s;hop &s;tood deprived till the parliament was a&s;&s;embled in the &s;ucceeding year, when an agreement was entered into between the bi&s;hop and the men of his province, which was made a record of that high court: The chief articles of privilege then e&s;tabli&s;hed are as follow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 99$.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That no freeman &s;hall be impri&s;oned by the bi&s;hop's baili&s;&s;s in his franchi&s;e, otherwi&s;e than is u&s;ed in other places in the realm, and the inque&s;ts to be made by the bi&s;hop's coroners, as is el&s;ewhere u&s;ed in the realm, according to the form of the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>The people prayed that no freeman of the bi&s;hopric be impleaded in court Chri&s;|tian, but only in ca&s;e of wills and matrimony; and that tho&s;e who are impleaded on other matters in the &s;ame court, may have prohibition and attachment again&s;t the o&s;&s;icial, as well as again&s;t the party.

But the di&s;plea&s;ure the bi&s;hop had entertained again&s;t the convent could
<PB N="249" REF="296">not be removed; his ob&s;tinate pride was &s;uperior to reconciliation, and an indig|nity once committed could not be expiated: Such was the prelate's inexorable temper. Pope Boniface having departed this life, Benedict was elected to the See of Rome, from whom the bi&s;hop obtained a bull, directed to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and the bi&s;hops of Lincoln and Worce&s;ter, commanding them to vi&s;it the convent of Durham. The bi&s;hop accu&s;ed the prior of dilapidations and other offences, touching which the pope commi&s;&s;ioned the above-named prelates to make due enquiry; but before any determination was had, the pope died. In the year 1305 pope Clement was elected, who, in the fir&s;t year of his pontificate, created the bi&s;hop of Durham Patriarch of Jeru&s;alem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 752.</NOTE>. On the charges he brought again&s;t the prior, the pope, at his in&s;tance, &s;u&s;pended him, as well in temporali|ties as in &s;piritual matters. The prior intending to travel to Rome to make a per|&s;onal defence, took up his re&s;idence for the winter near Canterbury, and &s;ent two monks, his proctors, to prepare his appeal. The bi&s;hop committed the care of the religious hou&s;e to H. de Luceby; and a mandate was obtained from the pope, directing the abbot of La&s;enby to give him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: But when they came to the convent, the monks &s;hut the door again&s;t them, and denied them entrance; on which they excommunicated the prior, the heads of the convent, and all tho&s;e who refu&s;ed their admittance. This occa&s;ioned new troubles: The pope interfering with temporalities, was an inva&s;ion of the rights of the crown, which brought on a judicial examination of the whole tran&s;action, and the parties were loaded with a heavy fine. The prior afterwards, returning from the &s;outhern parts, met the king at Durham, in who&s;e pre&s;ence he celebrated ma&s;s at the altar of St O&s;wald, on that &s;aint's anniver&s;ary. He obtained the king's recommendatory letters to the See of Rome, and was received by the pope and cardinals with great attention. After a &s;hort time he prepared to return, with a &s;entence of re&s;titution, for which the trea&s;ury of the convent was commanded to pay 1000 marks; but the prior de|parted this life at Rome, and his goods, hor&s;es, plate, books, and jewels were con|fi&s;cated to the pope's u&s;e. William de Tanfield, prior of Wederhall, &s;ucceeded, at the in&s;tance of the See of Rome, who was charged with purcha&s;ing this office by the payment of 3000 marks to the pope, and 1000 marks to the cardinals<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">R. de Gray&s;tanes.&mdash;Lel.

<P>The king, having failed in his purpo&s;e of humbling bi&s;hop Bek by the authority of his parliament, on the complaint of the men of his palatinate, lay wait for occa|&s;ions to effect his purpo&s;e; and, in the year 1306, he again deprived the bi&s;hop, and &s;eized the liberties of the bi&s;hopric, for various new offences charged again&s;t him<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A.

In his late quarrels with the convent, he had procured &s;uch in&s;truments from the court of Rome as were adjudged injurious to the rights of the crown: He had al&s;o &s;hewed his contempt of the king's command, in per&s;i&s;ting in his per|&s;ecution of the monks, be&s;ides other offences now imputed to him, by which the king's re&s;entment was renewed. Indeed it appears he was a&s;&s;iduous in &s;eeking occa&s;ion to humble the prelate, as well as gratify his implacable hatred, which, notwith&s;tanding late appearances, &s;till rankled at his heart; and, after this la&s;t
<PB N="250" REF="297">breach, he never was reconciled to the bi&s;hop during his exi&s;tence. The guardi|an&s;hip of the bi&s;hopric was again committed to Robert de Clifford. The king now &s;tretched his authority to that pitch, as to fever from the palatinate Barnard Ca&s;tle, with its appendages, which he granted to the earl of Warwick: Hert and Hertne&s;s, or Hartlepool, he al&s;o took away from the bi&s;hop's lands, and granted to Robert de Clifford; and Kever&s;ton, which e&s;cheated to the palatine on the for|feiture of Chri&s;topher de Seaton, was given by the king to Geoffrey de Hercem|pole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. ii. p. 391.&mdash;Ang. Sac. p. 754.</NOTE>. It is ob&s;ervable, that the convent of Durham, at the king's in&s;tance, con|firmed tho&s;e grants under their conventual &s;eal: But the king, con&s;cious of the injury he was doing to the rights of the church, in&s;erted a protecting &s;alvo in the in&s;truments by which the&s;e territories were conveyed. The king al&s;o di&s;membered from the See, Werk in Tindale, Penrith in Cumberland, and the church of Sy|mondburn in Northumberland, which the bi&s;hop had of the gift of the king of Scotland, alledging they were previou&s;ly forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the bi&s;hopric was under this la&s;t &s;eizure, and in the keeping of Clifford, the nominees of the See of Rome prepared, by virtue of their commi&s;&s;ion, to en|ter into tho&s;e liberties, to enforce payment of arrears of certain di&s;mes, notwith|&s;tanding the king's &s;everal prohibitions; on which, by advice of his council, he i&s;|&s;ued his mandate to the guardian, &s;trictly commanding him not to permit them to execute any thing there touching that matter. This, and other oppo&s;itions, of|fended the pope &s;o much, that he &s;ent letters to the king, complaining of the wrongs he had done to the church at Durham, and commanding him to reform &s;uch exce&s;&s;es, and make re&s;titution<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prynn, v. iii. p. 1130.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the parliament held at Carli&s;le, 1307, immediately preceding the king's death, it was repre&s;ented, that the bi&s;hop of Durham had greatly wa&s;ted the woods appertaining to his bi&s;hopric, particularly by &s;upplying iron forges, &s;melting of lead, and making charcoal; on which an inhibition was awarded, to prevent &s;uch wa&s;te in future<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ryley's Plac. p. 335.&mdash;Ang.

<P>The various circum&s;tances attending king Edward's la&s;t campaign in the Scotti&s;h war, are not &s;ufficiently pertinent to this work to demand a place here. Brus was now at the head of the Scotti&s;h army, and the king, with all the inveteracy of implacable hatred, vowing the utter ruin of a nation who&s;e greate&s;t offence was re&s;i&s;tance of his oppre&s;&s;ions, and their love of liberty, now carried with him the prince of Wales, to in&s;pire his heart with the &s;ame rancour which irritated the vengeance his father cheri&s;hed. He conferred the order of knighthood on a band of 300 youths, &s;ons of the greate&s;t Engli&s;h families, who were to &s;hare the laurels preparing for the prince their leader. The king made a bloody vow on the occa|&s;ion, which his &s;on &s;econded by a &s;imilar one, purporting, that he would not re&s;t two nights in one place, till his father's purpo&s;e was accompli&s;hed. The &s;ucceed|ing events were full of the tremendous executions of war. Chri&s;topher Seaton, brother-in-law to Brus, with &s;everal other pri&s;oners of the fir&s;t rank, were drawn, hanged, and quartered, at Dumfries. Thomas and Alexander Brus were made
<PB N="251" REF="298">pri&s;oners, and executed at Carli&s;le. But tho&s;e &s;everities could not &s;ubdue the &s;pi|rits of a fierce and heroic people: The lo&s;s of relations, the cry of injuries, and the &s;poil and deva&s;tation of a country, only irritated them to more de&s;perate acts of valour, and in&s;uperable fortitude, adding thereto the rage of de&s;pair, and the gall of revenge. Brus, with a &s;mall army of de&s;perate heroes, gained a multitude of advantages again&s;t the parties with whom he engaged, which induced the king, then in a very precarious &s;tate of health, be&s;et with the infirmities of old age, and labouring under threatening &s;hocks of an incurable di&s;ea&s;e, to march from Carli&s;le, at the head of the main army; but he was not able to advance further than about two miles north of Burgh upon Sands, where he expired in the arms of his at|tendants.</P>
<P>Thus departed one of the greate&s;t monarchs that ever wore the diadem of Eng|land. He was a man of a clear judgment, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a mind fired with the quick|e&s;t apprehen&s;ion, and the ju&s;te&s;t images. His valour and courage were &s;uperior to every danger: In military knowledge he was not equalled by any cotemporary, and in ardour he out&s;tripped the generals of the age. His temper was ha&s;ty; he was jealous of an affront, and unremitting in his enmity. He paid all due reve|rence to the mini&s;ters of religion, yet was no bigot, and dete&s;ted &s;uper&s;titious &s;la|very. As a legi&s;lator, the laws made in his reign have &s;pread their influence to this di&s;tant age, and greatly contribute to maintain the happy con&s;titution of this king|dom. Whether the commons were admitted di&s;tinctly to a &s;hare in the legi&s;lative body of this nation, before his reign, is a matter of &s;peculation too deep and in|tricate for the&s;e pages; but certain it is, under this prince they &s;tand confirmed as part thereof, and from his time have con&s;tantly formed a branch of the legi&s;lature, and thereby maintained, and rendered permanent, the liberties of the &s;ubject, and the franchi&s;es of this highly favoured country. This, and the law re&s;pecting tallages, make the memory of Edward I. immortal to the lovers of this country.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that, in 1295, when Edward cau&s;ed the &s;heriffs to invite the towns and boroughs, of the different counties, to &s;end their deputies to parlia|ment, and when the repre&s;entation of the people was more e&s;pecially called for in the great a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;tate, this palatinate did not partake of the invitation, but, holding fa&s;t its ancient privileges, the bi&s;hop, with his council, formed tho&s;e provincial in&s;titutes which were nece&s;&s;ary for the government of this di&s;trict. The viceroy and his people were &s;ubject to the general laws of the empire, and they were obligatory on this province; but the ancient legi&s;lation prevailed in the pe|culiar rules and orders of the palatinate. Durham was no otherwi&s;e repre&s;ented in parliament, than by the prelate's &s;itting in the hou&s;e of peers.</P>
<P>This being a great aera in our con&s;titution, it may not be ami&s;s to remark in this place, that the &s;tatute of Henry IV. which enjoins proclamation to be made by the &s;heriff in his county, doth not imply, that all per&s;ons pre&s;ent there &s;hould pro|ceed to election of knights, but only all <HI>&s;uitors</HI> of that court; &s;o that the &s;ucceed|ing re&s;triction to qualifications of 40<ABBR>s.</ABBR> a-year was not an exclu&s;ion which operated on inhabitants at large<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So incon&s;iderable was the number of freeholders, prior to the 8th Hen. VI. 1429, that, for every in|dividual then, there were at lea&s;t fifty per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right of voting at the la&s;t general election; and, at the above date (1429), not one in a hundred per&s;ons was a frecholder, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the boa&s;ted fran|chi&s;e.</NOTE>, but freeholders only, for &s;uch were &s;uitors of the county,
<PB N="252" REF="299">and few they were in number in that age. In con&s;equence, the modern cry of ge|neral repre&s;entation is not grounded on principles of that antiquity, but mu&s;t refer to much more di&s;tant, even in the Saxon times, of who&s;e cu&s;toms, in regard to the witagenmote, we have imperfect evidence. The &s;tatutes relative to proclamation of writs of election remedied the partial &s;ummons &s;heriffs had been u&s;ed to give, they, being officers of the crown, too frequently, in &s;ervility to government, &s;um|moned only &s;uch as were certain to accord with the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Edward II. no &s;ooner &s;ucceeded to the throne, than he te&s;tified a di&s;like to the vengeful injunctions of his father: He made a &s;hort progre&s;s into Scotland, and, leaving a general there, more for the purpo&s;e of receiving the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who were not adherents to Brus than to pro&s;ecute the war, he repaired to the capi|tal. But this was not the mo&s;t &s;triking in&s;tance of his contempt of his father's will; for, contrary to his mo&s;t earne&s;t injunctions, even attended with a horrid cur&s;e, he recalled from exile his licentious favourite Gave&s;ton, and, heaping ho|nours upon him, among&s;t other in&s;tances of high di&s;tinction, created him earl of Cornwall. It is pre&s;umed bi&s;hop Bek joined with the flatterers who crouded round the throne of this di&s;&s;olute prince, and encouraged his affections for Gave|&s;ton; and, by in&s;inuations of the like depraved nature, ingratiated him&s;elf into king Edward's favour, through which he not only obtained re&s;titution of his bi&s;hopric, but al&s;o a grant of the &s;overeignty of the I&s;le of Man for life: So that from the di&s;grace which over&s;hadowed him in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t reign, we &s;ee him emerging with the di&s;tingui&s;hed dignities of palatine of Durham, king of Man, and patriarch of Jeru&s;alem.

<P>His public works were magnificent.

<P>Mr Noble &s;ays of this prelate's coinage, <Q>There is no other money of this &startq;bi&s;hop, or of any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, but pennies: The rea&s;on of this is, that when the bi&s;hops of this See obtained the grant of a mint, it was the only &s;ort of money we had: The archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York for &s;ome time coined only the penny. The fir&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical mint that &s;truck any other &s;ort of money than the penny, was that of the abbots of Reading, who had a particular charter for that purpo&s;e granted them by K. Edward III. in who&s;e reign we have the penny, halfpenny, and the farthing<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mr Leake's Hi&s;torical Account of Engli&s;h Money, p. 91, 92. and Mr Bartlet on the Epi&s;copal Coins of Durham, &amp;c. vol. v. of the Archaelogia, p. 338. The latter gentleman acquaints us, that the abbot of Reading had a grant from K. Edw. I. to coin pennies.</NOTE>. It &s;eems very &s;trange that the prelates, particularly the metropolitans, &s;hould not have had this privilege as &s;oon as the abbots of Reading. In proce&s;s of time, however, half groats, and half pence, were coined in the mints of the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and of York; and the ambitious Wol&s;ey, as primate of York, &endq;was bold enough to coin groats.</Q></P>
<P>This prelate's money is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a cro&s;s moline (his family arms) upon &s;ome part of them, whereof he was o&s;tentatious, as appears by his &s;eal.</P>

<P>In taking a review of this prelate's character, it mu&s;t be remembered, that he enjoyed a plu|rality of cures, and was &s;ecretary to the king at the time he was advanced to the See of Durham. The fir&s;t in&s;tance in which he &s;hewed the boldne&s;s of a re&s;olute judgment, was in his an&s;wer to the archbi&s;hop's de|mand of excommunicating his convent. His fortitude, when be&s;et by ru&s;&s;ians at Rome, who broke into his apartment, to revenge the in&s;ults committed by his &s;ervants, and his an&s;wer to king Edward I. which fir&s;t occa&s;ioned his &s;overeign's hatred, &s;hewed his un&s;haken magnanimity of &s;oul. Had his other principles been as noble, his cha|racter would have been as illu&s;trious as his life was magnificent. But his pride was prevalent in every action of his life: It was the bias by which every part of his conduct was influenced; and that pride affronted, brought forth implacable aver&s;ion, as has been &s;een in his conte&s;ts with the convent, in which it is evident he could not brook the indignity of contradiction; &s;o highly did he e&s;timate his own con&s;equence. He was plea&s;ed with military parade, and martial di&s;cipline; but though he was de&s;irous of a retinue of &s;oldiers about him, he affected a &s;eeming indifference and negligence towards them, and &s;hewed no concern whil&s;t the greate&s;t nobles bent the knee to him, and officers of the army waited &s;tand|ing as he &s;at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Gray&s;tanes.&mdash;Ang. Sac. p. 746.</NOTE>. He thought nothing too dear that could contribute to his public &s;ame for magnificence; as an in&s;tance of which, Gray&s;tanes tells us, one time in London he paid 40 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for forty fre&s;h herrings (now about 80 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling money) when they had been refu&s;ed by the mo&s;t opulent per&s;ons of the realm, then a&s;&s;embled in parliament. At another time he bought a piece of cloth, which was held up a$ &s;o high a price, that, proverbially, it was &s;aid to be too dear for the bi&s;hop of Dur|ham, which he ordered to be cut into cloths for his &s;umpter hor&s;es. He &s;eized the king's palfrey as a deodand, it having killed its rider in the way to Scotland,
<PB N="256" REF="303">within the liberties of his palatinate. His breach of confidence in depriving the &s;on of Ve&s;cy, and &s;elling the barony of Alnwick, was derived from a wound his pride received in &s;ome contemptuous je&s;t the ba&s;tard put upon him, which he never could forgive; and, in gratifying his re&s;entment, he was guilty of the ba&s;e&s;t perfidy to his decea&s;ed friend. He was &s;o impatient of re&s;t, that he never took more than one &s;leep, &s;aying, it was unbecoming a man to turn from one &s;ide to the other in bed. He was perpetually either riding from one manor to another, or hunting or hawking. Though his expences were very great, he was provident enough never to want money. He always ro&s;e from his meals with an appetite; and his continence was &s;o &s;ingular, that he never looked a woman full in the face: Whence, in the tran&s;lation of St William of York, when the other bi&s;hops de|clined touching the Saint's remains, through a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having forfeited their virginity, he alone boldly handled them, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the ceremony with due reverence.

The &s;ubject is &s;o trilling, that we &s;hall not enter into a farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the matter. Though it is &s;aid in the text, that our bi&s;hop died in 1$10, we think that Godwin, Wharton, and Tanner, place it with greater propriety in 1311. The &s;ame time, indeed, is intended; but it ought to be remembered, that our carlier writers u&s;ually reckou the beginning of the year from the birth or circumci&s;ion of our Saviour, and not from the annunciation. By the way, Dr Richard&s;on, in a note, corrects Godwin, as guilty of a mi&s;take, and refers to a privy &s;eal in Rymer's Feadera, for &s;eizing our prelate's temporalities into the hands of the king, as a proof that Bet$'s death &s;hould be dated in 1$10.

<P>With them were joined, both in company and affec|tion, the forces of the noble bi&s;hop of Durham, the mo&s;t valiant clerk in the kingdom, and truly a true Chri&s;tian; by which I would be under&s;tood that he was wi&s;e, elo|quent, temperate, ju&s;t, and cha&s;te, unequalled by any rich man in his regular manner of living. He had neither pride, avarice, nor envy; not that he wanted a proper &s;pirit to defend his rights, when he could not work on his enemies by gentle mea&s;ures, for he was &s;o guided by his con&s;cience as to make every one marvel. In all the king's wars he u&s;ed to appear in noble array, attended by a numerous and honourable retinue.</P>

<P>Although the See continued vacant a very &s;hort time, the contentions of the archbi&s;hop of York greatly di&s;turbed the convent.

This occa&s;ioned the metropolitan to thunder out his excom|munication again&s;t all parties acting therein. A licence was obtained from the king, then at Berwick, for electing a prelate. Bi&s;hop Bek departed this life on the 3d day of March 1310; the licence was had on the 20th, and the election on the la&s;t day of the &s;ame month; the exigencies of &s;tate urging that important of|fice to be filled with as little de po&s;&s;ible.

Sac. p. 755.&mdash;Rymer's Foedera, v. iii. p. 251, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before the day of election, the king &s;ent the earl of Glouce&s;ter to Durham, entreating the convent to nominate his kin&s;man Antoline de Pi&s;ana, an alien by birth, unknown to any of the monks, and &s;aid to be under canonical age. Many rich pre&s;ents were offered to induce the chapter to con&s;ent, but, with much reli|gious virtue, they refu&s;ed. The convent was in great confu&s;ion touching the man|ner in which the election &s;hould be made: They knew that the archbi&s;hop would r$fu&s;e to confirm any act done by tho&s;e under his excommunication; and to with|draw them&s;elves, was an actual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the offen&s;ive exerci&s;e of the metro|politan's u&s;urped juri&s;diction. Of the two evils they thought it expedient, in times of &s;uch emergency, to prevent the See remaining longer vacant; and con|&s;equently ab&s;ented, and left the bu&s;ine&s;s to tho&s;e of the fraternity who were not un|der cen&s;ure; and accordingly, on the la&s;t day of March A. D. 1311, RICHARD KELLOW, a monk of that hou&s;e, was cho&s;en. He had the king's a&s;&s;ent at Berwick on the 11th day of April, was pre&s;ented to the archbi&s;hop at Newbrough on the 19th of the &s;ame month, was examined at Hexham on the 4th day of May, all parties were cited to &s;hew cau&s;e again&s;t his election, if any was, at Bryn&s;ton on the 10th; and the next day he was confirmed at Ripon. He received re&s;titution of the tem|poralities from the king's commi&s;&s;ioner on the 20th, was con&s;ecrated at York on the 30th of the &s;ame month, and, on St Cuthbert's day in September, was &s;o|l$$$ly enthroned at Durham. After the election was over, and before confirma|tion, the archbi&s;hop vi&s;ited the chapter of Durham, rever&s;ed his cen&s;ure, and re|lieved them from the penalties and injunctions impo&s;ed by bi&s;hop Bek.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between bi&s;hop Kellow and the monks of his convent. He took infinite plea&s;ure in their &s;ociety, and never was without &s;ome of them as his private companion. He cho&s;e his chancellor and &s;ene&s;chal out of the cloi&s;ter, and made one of them his confe&s;&s;or. In like cordiality he lived with the people of his palatinate, yet maintaining a &s;trict propriety of conduct, not &s;pa|ring any offender by rea&s;on of his dignity; which was in&s;tanced in the penance
<PB N="259" REF="306">he compelled Ralph Neville to undergo for the heinous &s;in of ince&s;t with his daughter. The fir&s;t year after his con&s;ecration, he revoked the acts of his prede|ce&s;&s;or, by deed in writing, where they were prejudicial to the convent, and re&s;to|red their ancient privileges. He gave to the prior and convent Wa&s;trop-head, and a fi&s;hery in the river Were; and ordained, that the tithes of rabbits in Holy I&s;land be paid to the prior of that cell, which he confirmed by deed in writing. In the year 1313, the prior, William de Tan&s;ield, re&s;igned accepting the cell of Jarrow, and the manor of Wardle, for his maintenance; the &s;ub-prior. Galfrid de Burdon, &s;ucceeded him.</P>
<P>The king's attachment to Gave&s;ton &s;till occa&s;ioned much trouble in the &s;tate; during which inte&s;tine di&s;tractions the Scots gained many advantages, and &s;pread their deva&s;tations over the northern counties. The favourite &s;hewed much per|&s;onal courage whil&s;t he commanded the army in Scotland, the enemy a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly avoiding coming to a deci&s;ive engagement. But he was altogether &s;o obnoxious to the leaders of the prevailing faction, that the king could not &s;ave him from the &s;entence of the ordainers, who condemned him to perpetual bani&s;hment. He was not the only object on whom they fixed their re&s;entment; lord Henry de Beau|mont, nearly allied to the queen, and his &s;i&s;ter, the lady Ve&s;cy, were removed from court; many of the king's grants to them were rever&s;ed, particularly one of the Ca&s;tle of Bambrough, which was withdrawn from the latter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carte. ii. 320.

<P>In the king's ab&s;ence, Brus made many inroads, by which he greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the inhabitants of Northumberland, whence they were induced to enter into a &s;e|parate truce, for which they paid 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the total reduction of Scotland was the con&s;equence of his &s;ucce&s;sful efforts in that year. Such was the unhappy &s;tate of the northern parts of England, that the king was under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending letters to pope Clement, dated the 17th of October, to pray he might excu&s;e the attendance of bi&s;hop Kellow at the council of Vienna, on account of the urgent occa&s;ion there was for his pre&s;ence in the palatinate, to defend tho&s;e territories again&s;t the Scots, whom he de&s;cribes coming forth like wolves out of their dens, and committing their ravages without di&s;tinction of innocence, &s;ex, or age, or even the holy immunities of eccle&s;ia&s;tical liberties<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">A.

<P>The calamities of the &s;tate, the in&s;olence of the confederate barons, and all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es the king laboured under, could not wean him from his favourite, who returned to him from his exile, in January, to receive re&s;titution of his honours, and a rever&s;ion of his &s;entence, by the &s;overeign's arbitrary act, contrary to the determination of the parliament and his council. This induced the barons, who had cho&s;en the earl of Lanca&s;ter for their leader, to appear openly in arms, pro|fe&s;&s;edly to compel the king's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the ordinances, and give up the minion to his &s;ate. The queen was Gave&s;ton's utter enemy; he had in&s;olently affronted her, in &s;uch a manner as to induce her to make complaint to her royal father, re|pre&s;enting,
<PB N="260" REF="307">pre&s;enting, that he was the &s;ole cau&s;e of all her misfortunes; that the king's fond|ne&s;s for the unworthy favourite had alienated his affections from her, and made him an entire &s;tranger to her bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin, p. 390.</NOTE>. This contributed to encourage the barons their purpo&s;e, and urge them to its execution. The king moved northward with his favourite, and was &s;o expeditiou&s;ly followed by a detachment of the barouns' army, that the day he left Newca&s;tle they entered that place. From Tynemouth the king pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ea to Scarborough, and there left Gave&s;ton, pre&s;uming the fortre&s;s impregnable, till he &s;hould rai&s;e forces to repel the in&s;urgents; but, the ca&s;tle being &s;tormed, Gave&s;ton was made pri&s;oner, and &s;oon after brought to a &s;hort trial and beheaded, by Lanca&s;ter and others, the mo&s;t violent of the faction, at Warwick. The &s;overeign was left to rage to the winds, his tears and menaces unavailing, few being &s;o hardy as to join him in the propo&s;ed &s;ervice; whil&s;t the barons gained greater confidence from this bold but atrocious action, and now, &s;up|ported by a powerful army, marched to the capital, to compel the king, by force of arms, to admit and perform the articles they had ordained, for the better go|vernment of the &s;tate, demanding, at the &s;ame time, a general amne&s;ty.</P>
<P>About the beginning of this prelate's epi&s;copacy, a new race of marauders ap|peared, who were called &s;hevalds, a banditti of robbers, who came in troops from the mountains, and committed depredations on the villages. The bi&s;hop was very diligent in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them; and one John de Wedale was &s;lain by his &s;oldiers in Holy I&s;land, under the command of the bi&s;hop's brother. The king had taken great offence at the bi&s;hop, for not declaring him&s;elf publicly for him again&s;t the barons, and refu&s;ing to defend the unhappy favourite: He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the circum&s;tance of John de Wedale's death, and wrote to the pope letters of grievous accu&s;ation again&s;t the bi&s;hop, petitioning for his deprivation, or at lea&s;t his tran|&s;lation to &s;ome le&s;s powerful bi&s;hopric; and at the &s;ame time attempted to bring the bi&s;hop's brother to execution, on a charge of blood, for the death of the rob|bers, but failed in both.</P>
<P>Brus did not neglect to avail him&s;elf of the troubles which affected the northern parts of England. The bi&s;hop of Durham was obliged to be ab&s;ent from his pa|latinate on the accu&s;ations before-mentioned: Robert de Gray&s;tanes &s;ays, he was attending a parliament then held at London; but that is an error, no parliament being convened amid&s;t the troubles and confu&s;ions of that year<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. p. 756.</NOTE>. About the middle of Augu&s;t, the Scotti&s;h army entered England, and burnt the towns of Hexham and Corbridge; whil&s;t a detachment moved &s;o &s;ecretly and with &s;uch ra|pidity, as to &s;urpri&s;e the inhabitants in their beds at Durham, and reduced the whole &s;uburbs to a&s;hes. They advanced to Hartlepool, which they &s;acked and plundered; and, on a compo&s;ition of 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> (Gray&s;tanes &s;ays 1000 marks only) they &s;pared the re&s;t of the county from deva&s;tation, granting a &s;eparate truce till the Mid&s;ummer following, on condition that the Scotti&s;h army &s;hould march through the province, on any future expedition, without mole&s;tation. Northumberland and the other northern counties made a like compo&s;ition<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The following year, a truce having been obtained by the interce&s;&s;ion of the king of France, the king &s;ubmitted to his barons, and a&s;&s;ented to the general pardon demanded; on which the parliament granted large &s;upplies for the Scotti&s;h war. The army led forth for this campaign (the relief of Stirling Ca&s;tle being the fir&s;t object) is &s;poken of by hi&s;torians as the &s;ine&s;t body of troops ever commanded by the king of England in any &s;ervice; &s;aid to have con&s;i&s;ted of 100,000 men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barbour.</NOTE>, of which 40,000 were hor&s;emen, 3000 completely armed "with helyt hor&s;e in plate and mayl" for the front of the battle, and 52000 archers: York&s;hire furni&s;hed 4000 foot, Northumberland 2500, the bi&s;hopric of Durham 1500<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, v. iii. p. 431.</NOTE> They were ordered to rendezvous at Berwick, and thence marched in ten divi&s;ions of ten thou&s;and each. The writers of tho&s;e times give a magnificent account of the mili|tary parade and &s;plendid &s;hew of this va&s;t armament; which, by injudicious mea|&s;ures, and an unpropitious fate attending a divided intere&s;t, the union between the king and his people being neither warm nor &s;incere, in oppo&s;ition to a body of forces not exceeding 30,000, were put to the rout at the battle of Bannockburn, on Mid&s;ummer-day, A. D. 1314, and a dreadful carnage en&s;ued<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The reader will &s;ind a particular account of this battle in the View of Northumbetland.</NOTE>. It is not &s;aid what was the particular fate of the palatine troops, but the bi&s;hop's conduct on this occa&s;ion rein&s;tated him in the royal favour: He not only &s;upplied the &s;tipu|lated number of forces, but al&s;o pre&s;ented to the king a free gift of 1000 marks with a gallant war-hor&s;e or charger of great price, which, being given to the earl of Glouce&s;ter, he was killed from off him in the engagement. Lord Clifford, who had Hartlepool in an arbitrary manner be&s;towed upon him on bi&s;hop Bek's di&s;|grace, was al&s;o &s;lain. The king, in con&s;equence of their reconciliation, promi&s;ed the bi&s;hop, that, if he &s;urvived, he &s;hould be re&s;tored to the territories of Barnard|ca&s;tle and Hartlepool. By the preceding circum&s;tance it appears, that the plea of the military tenants of the bi&s;hopric was not &s;upported; their &s;erving at the battle of Bannockburn &s;ufficiently proving that they were not entitled to any &s;uch immu|nity as they claimed, but, as con&s;i&s;tent with other military &s;ervice, might be called to war in any part of the land.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the melancholy con&s;equences of the &s;atal defeat at Bannock|burn, a new aid was granted in the parliament held at York, in the month of September following: But whil&s;t the panic of the late victory prevailed in the minds of the Engli&s;h, and the languid powers of government &s;lowly proceeded in mea&s;ures to pro&s;ecute the war, the Scots pur&s;ued their advantage, and a large body of forces, led by Edward Brus and Sir James Douglas, over-ran Northumberland, and put the inhabitants of the palatinate under a heavy contribution, to &s;ave their country from a threatened de&s;olation. The ravages of war were dreadful, but much more tremendous were the mi&s;eries of the encrea&s;ing famine; the calami|ties attending which were &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, as to oblige the legi&s;lature to make a law for regulating the price of provi&s;ions, which, under the encrea&s;ing afflictions of ano|ther year, was obliged to be repealed. Scotland could not e&s;cape this vi&s;itation:
<PB N="262" REF="309">That country, le&s;s calculated for tillage, experienced a greater want of bread, a quarter of wheat being &s;old for 100 &s;hillings. To di&s;tre&s;s the inhabitants to the extreme, the Engli&s;h navy was employed in &s;mall &s;quadrons on the coa&s;ts, to in|tercept &s;upplies from other countries; and proclamations were i&s;&s;ued, prohibiting all per&s;ons, under &s;evere penalties, carrying any kind of provi&s;ion to the enemy: Such inhumanity prevailed in the barbarous politics of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>The king of France laboured much to effect a reconciliation between the powers at war; and Brus, &s;hewing a willingne&s;s to accede to terms honourable to him|&s;elf and his people, appointed amba&s;&s;adors, and a congre&s;s was held at Durham: But king Edward ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing to acknowledge Robert Brus king of Scot|land, and he, with a dignity derived from his military atchievements, per&s;i&s;ting in his title to the crown, no terms were entered into by the delegates, and fre&s;h ho|&s;tilities commenced; the king of France, who&s;e mediation might have &s;oftened the arrogance of Edward, having departed this life during the negociation.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the calamities of the times, the Scotti&s;h army, in the &s;pring of the year 1316, entered into England, &s;weeping away all kinds of provi&s;ions as they pa&s;&s;ed. The bi&s;hop of Durham and &s;everal of the northern barons were excu&s;ed their attendance on parliament on this exigence. The Scots pa&s;&s;ed the we&s;tern march, and penetrated into York&s;hire; from thence they entered the bi&s;hopric of Durham by the heights of Tee&s;dale and Weredale, not daring to attack the for|tre&s;s of Ca&s;tle Barnard: They took their way &s;o near to Durham, as to lay wa&s;te, plunder, and de&s;troy the beautiful retreat of the monks at Beaurepaire, together with other places in the neighbourhood. They ravaged the country as far as Hartlepool, which place they plundered of all the effects they could find, the in|habitants having &s;aved the mo&s;t valuable by putting them on board the ve&s;&s;els in the harbour, which on that occa&s;ion put out to &s;ea.

<P>It was not till the month of November that any forces were &s;ent into this part of the kingdom to oppo&s;e the Scots, when the lord Henry Beaumont and Adam de Winburn came into Northumberland.

For the greater &s;ecurity of the march, the bi&s;hop granted his Ca&s;tle of Norham to be held and garri&s;oned by the king until the following Mid&s;ummer, the king &s;aving to the church all po&s;&s;ibility of prejudice from precedent in this

<P>In the following year, the parliament held at Lincoln granted new &s;upplies, in which the earl of Lanca&s;ter had the a&s;cendency, was at the head of the council, determining all matters touching the further pro&s;ecution of this unpro&s;itable war, and was created the king's lieutenant and general of the army, for this &s;ervice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, v. iii. 535.</NOTE>: But nothing of moment was attempted this year. The rendezvous of miltary &s;ervants was &s;u&s;pended until the month of Augu&s;t, when the king came down to York, and from thence was prorogued till eight days after Michaelmas. The mi|&s;eries con&s;equent to war and famine were encrea&s;ed in the northern parts to the greate&s;t extremity. The repeated incur&s;ions of the enemy, and the cruel deva&s;|tations with which their progre&s;s was every where marked, together with a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of three unfruitful years, brought the price of a quarter of wheat to forty &s;hillings. Rapin's de&s;cription of the famine is to this effect: <Q>Mean time the &startq;famine raged in &s;o terrible a manner, that one can hardly give credit to what hi&s;torians &s;ay of it. They are not content with telling us, that the mo&s;t loathed animals were u&s;ed for food, but, what is much more horrible, people were forced to hide their children with all imaginable care, to prevent their being &s;tolen and eaten by thieves. They a&s;&s;ure us, that men them&s;elves took precau|tions to hinder their being murdered in private places, knowing that there were but too many in&s;tances that &s;ome had been &s;erved in that manner, to feed &s;uch as could find no other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. We are told likewi&s;e that the pri&s;oners in the gaols devoured one another in a barbarous manner; the extreme &s;carcity of provi&s;ions not permitting their being allowed nece&s;&s;ary food. The bloody &s;lux, cau&s;ed by gro&s;s feeding, compleated the mi&s;ery of the Engli&s;h: Such numbers &endq;died every day, that hardly could the living &s;uffice to bury the dead.</Q></P>
<P>It is alledged, that Lanca&s;ter held a traiterous corre&s;pondence with Brus, court|ing his friend&s;hip, in order that he might, by his aid, effect certain projects he had formed again&s;t the king; for as he was held in perpetual apprehen&s;ion of his re|&s;entment, for the part he had taken in Gave&s;ton's de&s;truction, &s;o his &s;ears grew into a &s;ettled aver&s;ion, which he &s;tudied to gratify.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the king remained at York, the bi&s;hop of Durham departed this life, on the 9th day of October, A. D. 1316, at his manor of Middleham, he having held the See little more than five years. He rebuilt the manor-hou&s;e at Stockton upon a beautiful plan, and al&s;o the hou&s;e called Le Wellhall, within 16 miles of York. His death was greatly lamented by the members of the convent, with whom his memory was held in great reverence. He had frequently promi&s;ed to give to the church, at his death, his library, ve&s;&s;els of &s;ilver, and the &s;urniture of his chapel; but the executors of his will, which he made during the extremity of &s;ickne&s;s, immediately before his death on the 29th of September, thought proper to have
<PB N="264" REF="311">them di&s;po&s;ed of in another manner. He ordered his remains to be interred above the &s;teps in the chapter-hou&s;e, near the prelate's &s;eat, where his tomb was covered with a marble monument. On the day of his funeral, agreeable to his will, 100 marks were di&s;tributed to the poor. The king &s;ent his almoner to attend the ob|&s;equies, who honoured the remains with an offering of a pall of cloth of gold; the earl of Lanca&s;ter al&s;o pre&s;ented three palls, richly embroidered with his arms, whereof ve&s;tments were afterwards made, in which the mini&s;ters officiated on &s;o|lemn days, when the convent wore white. The prelate's public conduct and cha|racter have already been noted: His parentage is not known. He was a man of literature, and irreproachable morals; he &s;upported his epi&s;copal character with great dignity, untainted with pride; he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the powers of oratory and eloquence, which were rendered more &s;triking and per&s;ua&s;ive by his maje&s;tic figure and graceful deportment.

It contains a great number of charters, grants, &s;urveys, commi&s;&s;ions, writs, &amp;c. i&s;&s;ued or made by that prelate, together with &s;everal letters, writs, and commi&s;&s;ions, &s;ent into the bi&s;hopric by K.

<P>&rindx; I have been informed, that this regi&s;ter was borrowed out of the cur&s;itor's office at Durham, by an agent of lord Oxford's, to produce as evidence relating to &s;ome of his e&s;tates in Northumberland, and that an accountable receipt was given for the &s;ame, and now remaining in the office.</P></NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>The See of Durham now became the object of various intere&s;ts. The earl of Lanca&s;ter interceded with the monks on the behalf of John de Kynarde&s;lei his chaplain, and promi&s;ed them, in ca&s;e they elected him for their prelate, he would protect the palatinate from the Scots; an engagement he could no otherwi&s;e have fulfilled, than by means of the &s;ecret influence before intimated. The king, then at York, applied for Thomas de Charlton, a civilian, and keeper of the privy &s;eal. The earl of Hereford wi&s;hed to promote John Walwayne, a civilian; and the queen, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;olicitations, made every intere&s;t in her power for Lewis de Bellomonte, vulgarly Beaumont, who was at that time trea&s;urer of Sa|li&s;bury, a man of high birth and alliance, being de&s;cended of the royal blood of France and Sicily, the brother of Henry lord Beaumont, then in great power in England, and cou&s;in to the queen. They were de&s;cended of Louis, &s;on to Charles earl of Anjou, a younger &s;on of Louis the Eighth, king of France. Louis was lord of Beaumont in France, and, by Agnes de Beaumont his lady, had the two &s;ons above mentioned, and I&s;abel, the wife of the la&s;t of the Ve&s;cy's of Alnwick Ca&s;tle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barnes's King Edward III.</NOTE>. It is &s;aid the queen was &s;o anxious for the &s;ucce&s;s of this election, that there was &s;carce a monk in the convent who had not letters of application from their &s;overeigns. But the monks, who held them&s;elves independent of every in|fluence
<PB N="266" REF="313">but a &s;piritual intimation, and &s;eldom inclined to obey a royal dictate, le&s;t &s;ome innovation might creep in upon their privileges, on the day of St Leone, in con&s;equence of the king's licence, they proceeded to election, and nominated Henry de Stamford prior of Finchale. Gray&s;tanes de&s;cribes him a man of &s;potle&s;s character, full age, an agreeable per&s;on, of a chearful countenance, and &s;ufficiently qualified in literature. Perhaps there never was an in&s;tance of &s;uch impotence of expectation, on the like occa&s;ion. Waiting the i&s;&s;ue of the matter then agitated in the chapter-hou&s;e, there were in the church the earls of Lanca&s;ter, Hereford, and Pembroke, and many other per&s;ons of con&s;equence. Lord Henry Beaumont, with a great retinue, together with his brother, were al&s;o there; and Gray&s;tanes &s;ays, <Q>there were others there who threatened to &s;mite off his head if he was elect|ed.&startq;&endq;</Q> The king &s;till remaining at York, would have confirmed the choice of the convent, had it not been for his queen, who &s;eeing his inclination, fell on her knees, &s;aying, <Q>my liege, I never yet a&s;ked any thing for my kindred; if you &startq;bear me affection, grant me, that my cou&s;in Lewis de Bellomonte be bi&s;hop of &endq;Durham.</Q> The king, overcome by this petition, refu&s;ed his confirmation, and &s;ent letters to the See of Rome in favour of Lewis. The bi&s;hop elect finding he could obtain no intere&s;t at court, and the chapter of York, afraid of the king's di&s;|plea&s;ure, not daring to grant their confirmation, the See being vacant by the death of William Grenfield, on a con&s;ultation of the convent, he agreed to travel to Rome; but, before his arrival, on the petition of the king and queen of England, and al&s;o of France, the pope gave the bi&s;hopric to Lewis; but, at the &s;ame time, impo&s;ed upon him &s;o heavy a mulct, that, for the whole time of his epi&s;copacy, he was not able to pay up the &s;tipulated &s;ums. By way of recompence to the bi&s;hop elect, again&s;t whom nothing could be ju&s;tly objected, the pope gave him a grant of the priory of Durham, on the next vacancy; but he did not live to reap any benefit therefrom. Exhau&s;ted with the fatigue of the voyage, and the vexation of mind he had &s;u&s;tained, he reached the cell of Stamford, where he remained till a gradual decline brought on his di&s;&s;olution. He departed this life on the day of St Gregory A. D. 1320, and was interred in the church of St Leonard, before the high altar. Gray&s;tanes &s;ays, a light was &s;een de&s;cending from heaven, like the rays of the &s;un, upon his tomb. He remarks, that he was born on the day of St Leonard, was elected on the fe&s;tival of that &s;aint, and was buried in the church of St Leonard.</P>

They robbed the cardinals and their attendants of all their valuables, but did not detain them, leaving them two hor&s;es to carry them to Durham. The lord Henry Beaumont and the bi&s;hop they made pri&s;oners, and conveyed them to the Ca&s;tle of Mitford, in&s;i&s;ting on a heavy ran&s;om for their liberty. It did not appear that the&s;e robbers were moved by principles of hatred to the bi&s;hop, or any na|tional prejudices again&s;t the peace-makers, but that Middleton was determined to commit every outrage in his power, to expre&s;s his re&s;entment to the king for ar|re&s;ting his cou&s;in Adam de Swinburn, who had &s;poken too warmly to his &s;overeign touching the affairs of the marches.

Gray&s;tanes &s;ays, in order to rai&s;e the money exacted for the bi&s;hop's ran&s;om, the prior of Durham was obliged to &s;ell the habits, plate, and jewels of the church. In this in&s;tance we &s;ee a great defect in the <HI>jura regalia</HI> of the palatinate, as tho&s;e holding tenure under the bi&s;hop were not obliged to rai&s;e a &s;ub&s;idy for the purpo&s;e of their &s;overeign pontiff's ran&s;om. Indeed &s;everal circum&s;tances are ob&s;ervable, viz. that he had not received con&s;ecration, and was not enthroned, neither had he received re&s;titution of the temporalities from the king, which con&s;titute &s;ei&s;in of the &s;ee. The convent was at a great expence touching the cardinals, by who&s;e autho|rity only, it &s;hould &s;eem, they could be induced to this &s;acrilegious u&s;e of the holy things of the altar, in favour of a prelate forced on them by the See of Rome. It appears that lord Henry Beaumont and the bi&s;hop were informed by a me&s;&s;enger
<PB N="268" REF="315">from the prior, that Middleton's marauding party was upon the road; but they were induced to de&s;pi&s;e the danger by a conceit that the king of Scotland, or tho&s;e in his intere&s;t, dared not attempt any thing again&s;t them, armed as they were with the powers of the See of Rome, and that the prior meant to amu&s;e them, as he might wi&s;h to impede Lewis's con&s;ecration.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop being liberated on payment of the &s;um &s;tipulated, he was con&s;ecrated at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the 26th day of March 1318; on the 4th of May he received re|&s;titution of the temporalities from the king, and made profe&s;&s;ion to the archbi&s;hop of York, at Thorp, on the 19th day of June following.</P>
<P>The cardinals legates were not received in Scotland, as they did not bring powers with them acknowledging Robert Brus king; and, in con&s;equence, their authority was treated with indignity and contempt. Their envoy or me&s;&s;enger was waylaid, robbed of the pope's bull and other in&s;truments he had in charge, and &s;ent naked to Berwick. This flagrant contempt of the pope's interpo&s;ition to re&s;tore peace, doth not appear to be &s;ucceeded by any material acts of ho&s;tility, in that year, from either &s;tate: The oppo&s;ition with which Lanca&s;ter and his con|federates di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the king, &s;eem to fill up that period.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding year, A. D. 1318, Berwick fell into the hands of the Scots by treachery, and Brus took up his re&s;idence in the ca&s;tle. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this &s;trong place enabled his forces to reduce many of the fortre&s;&s;es of Northumber|land; and, in de&s;tructive parties, they roved over the more &s;outhern parts, &s;acking and burning Northallerton, Boroughbridge, Ripon, Scarborough, and Skipton in Craven. How our palatinate fared, &s;urrounded with tho&s;e &s;cenes of de&s;truction, no hi&s;torian has related: It was &s;pared, and the exemption mu&s;t have been procu|red at a con&s;iderable expence. The legates, in con&s;equence of the conduct of the Scots, pronounced the excommunication and interdict with which they were armed, again&s;t Brus and all his adherents; but this fulmination did not retard their mea|&s;ures; &s;o that the king of England was obliged to &s;ummon his military tenants to attend him at York, and proceed in force again&s;t Scotland. A coalition of parties was effected by the legates, and Lanca&s;ter once more gained the a&s;cendency in &s;tate affairs. The military operations were retarded by &s;everal accidents, &s;o that it was thought expedient to di&s;band the army which was a&s;&s;embled, and call into &s;ervice all men north of Trent, from the age of 16 to 60, both hor&s;e and &s;oot, to be regularly arrayed, and ready to take the field, under their re&s;pective leaders, in three days notice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<PB N="269" REF="316">and early in the &s;ummer, A. D. 1319, the king convened his parliament, when &s;upplies were granted for this &s;ervice; but it was September before the army was a&s;&s;embled near Berwick. Many of the chief nobility appeared in this armament, but we hear nothing of the bi&s;hop of Durham. A regular &s;iege was formed to re|duce Berwick, and many military engines then in u&s;e, and &s;tratagems, were em|ployed for that purpo&s;e. But, in the height of the attack, Lanca&s;ter withdrew his troops. At this in&s;tant an army from Scotland, compo&s;ed of 10,000 veteran troops, entered England by the we&s;tern march, and were near effecting their pur|po&s;e of &s;urpri&s;ing the queen at York, which obliged the king to rai&s;e the &s;iege.</P>
<P>Soon after tho&s;e events, a truce was agreed upon, and con&s;ervators were ap|pointed for the northern counties, of whom four were named for Northumber|land, viz. William Ridel, Gilbert de Burwedon, John de Penreth, and Roger de Hor&s;ely, who&s;e charge, according to the tenor of their commi&s;&s;ion, was <Q>to keep &startq;the truce, to hear all complaints of injuries, and inquire thereof by un&s;u&s;pected &endq;men of the re&s;pective counties, and give judgment according to the articles of truce.</Q> It is ob&s;ervable, that, in this commi&s;&s;ion, we have the fir&s;t correct de&s;cription of the duty of a con&s;ervator of truce on the borders of the kingdoms that is to be met with on record. Commi&s;&s;ioners were, in a &s;hort time afterwards, nominated by both powers to treat of peace, and a congre&s;s was held in con&s;equence there|of; but the extravagant demands of each nation rendered every effort of the commi&s;&s;ioners abortive; and Lanca&s;ter's rebellion then breaking out, and his party profe&s;&s;edly adhering to the intere&s;t of Brus, threw the &s;tate into new and mo&s;t dan|gerous di&s;tre&s;&s;es. By the a&s;&s;iduity and fortitude of Hartcla, who was then gover|nor
<PB N="270" REF="317">of Carli&s;le, and commanded the forces of that di&s;trict, Lanca&s;ter was valiantly oppo&s;ed, and his progre&s;s &s;topped; and &s;oon after en&s;ued the battle of Borough|bridge, where Hereford was &s;lain, and Lanca&s;ter taken pri&s;oner.

<P>Tho&s;e pro&s;perous circum&s;tances induced the king to prepare for an expedition again&s;t Scotland, for which &s;upplies were granted, and the king's military tenants were ordered to a&s;&s;emble at Newca&s;tle on the 24th day of July, A.

After this the Engli&s;h forces ad|vanced to Edinburgh, from whence they were driven back by famine; in their re|turn wreaking their vengeance on the religious hou&s;es, and committing acts of &s;a|crilege more barbarous than tho&s;e of the &s;avage nations in the eighth century; &s;o little were the minds of men, in the cour&s;e of five centuries, cultivated in their habitual ferocity, under all the benefits of revealed religion. Every effort Edward made was unpropitious: The hated admini&s;tration of his favourites, the De Spen|cers, clogged the wheels of government with di&s;&s;atisfaction, and con&s;equently with reluctant mea&s;ures and &s;ervices. They had an a&s;cendency over the &s;overeign equal to that of Gave&s;ton, and perhaps from the &s;ame &s;pecies of influence. The queen entertained a mortal hatred to them. The Scots followed the heels of the king's retreating army, and a choice detachment, by an exertion of military ardour, had nearly &s;urpri&s;ed him at the abbey of Byland, in the north riding of York&s;hire. His flight was &s;o precipitate, and the exigence &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, that he left his plate, equi|page,
<PB N="271" REF="318">money, privy &s;eal, and other regalia, a prey to the enemy, he e&s;caping by Burlington to York. The county of Northumberland was compelled, by accu|mulated di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to make a &s;eparate truce, which was obtained at a va&s;t expence. Whether Durham was joined therein is uncertain, but mo&s;t probably it was. A general truce &s;oon after took place, and con&s;ervators were commi&s;&s;ioned as before, Ralph de Nevil, and Roger de Hor&s;ley, for Northumberland. At a council held at Bi&s;hop-Thorp, near York, for &s;ettling terms of conciliation, Dugdale &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, v. ii. p. 50.</NOTE>, the lord Henry Beaumont, though a baron of the realm, and &s;worn both of the great and privy council, as the record expre&s;&s;eth, being required to give his advice con|cerning this truce, irreverently an&s;wered, <HI>that he would give no advice therein;</HI> whereat the king, in great anger, commanded him to depart the council; on which he went out, &s;aying, <HI>he had rather be gone than &s;tay;</HI> which expre&s;&s;ion gave &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t, that, by con&s;ent of all the lords pre&s;ent, he was committed to pri&s;on; whereupon Hen. de Percy, and Ra. de Neville, became &s;ureties for his appearance upon &s;ummons; and, &s;oon afterwards, the king was reconciled to him. In the ratification of articles concluded in the truce, Richard de Emelden was joined with the two preceding commi&s;&s;ioners, con&s;ervators.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Durham's negligence and lukewarmne&s;s in the defence of his pa|latinate, occa&s;ioned the king, whil&s;t the truce was negociating, as a politic prepa|ration again&s;t accidents, which might ari&s;e to fru&s;trate its being carried into force, to i&s;&s;ue his &s;pecial writ for arming and arraying the people of the palatinate<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A.

<P>In the following year a war broke out between England and France, when the queen pa&s;&s;ed over to the continent to negociate a reconciliation; the re&s;ult of which was the king's con&s;igning, to his &s;on Edward, the continental dominions, and impowering him to do the homage required by the king of France for the
<PB N="272" REF="319">&s;ame. This &s;atal ce&s;&s;ion wrought the de&s;truction of the unhappy monarch: The prince was made independent of his father, and the queen gained power to declare openly her dete&s;tation of the De Spencers, and hatred to the king for his adherence to them, vowing &s;he would never return to England in peace, without they were removed from court, and their influence totally extingui&s;hed. This required force: A de&s;cent on the Engli&s;h coa&s;t was meditated: The malcontents were nu|merous in England, and the old adherents of the Lanca&s;trian faction were ripe for a revolt. The prince, under the influence of his mother, was contracted to Phi|lippa, daughter of the earl of Hainault, and, from repeated rehear&s;als of her wrongs, and tainted with her thir&s;t of revenge, he was induced to &s;hake off his allegiance to his father, though then only 15 years of age. In September 1325, the queen, with a powerful armament, made a de&s;cent on the coa&s;t of Suffolk; and the king, as if become the contempt of mankind, and the mark of providen|tial vengeance, &s;aw him&s;elf immediately de&s;erted by almo&s;t all his nobles, and even by his own brothers; the earls of Surrey and Arundel, the only two of the old nobility, remaining faithful to him. The De Spencers were &s;eized, and executed as traitors; and the di&s;tracted &s;overeign, after lurking about &s;ome &s;hort time in the ob&s;cure parts of Wales, was made pri&s;oner, compelled to re&s;ign his diadem, and, in the end, &s;uffered an execrable death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham's Hi&s;t. England, p. 127.&mdash;De la More's Life of Edward II.</NOTE>, by the hands of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins: A hor|rid tragedy, a&s;cribed to the queen, and Mortimer her favourite. Thus ended the days of that weak prince, who&s;e irre&s;olution in matters of con&s;equence, weak and indeterminate judgment, and ob&s;tinate adherence to favourites, who gratified his weake&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;graceful propen&s;ities, involved the &s;tate in the mo&s;t dangerous calamities, and robbed her of tho&s;e honours his father had purcha&s;ed. He a&s;cend|ed the throne, &s;urrounded with pro&s;perity and glory, and left it immer&s;ed in mis|fortunes and di&s;grace. The per&s;ecution and indignities this unfortunate monarch &s;uffered in the clo&s;e of royalty, and his cruel death, reflect great di&s;honour on the national character, and &s;tamp the aera with infamy.</P>
<P>Edward having been compelled (whil&s;t a clo&s;e pri&s;oner) to abdicate the throne, on the 13th of January A. D. 1327, prince Edward was proclaimed, and, on the fir&s;t day of the following month, crowned king of England; his father not ma|king his exit till the month of September in that year.</P>
<P>The Scots again appeared in arms, and &s;ummons were i&s;&s;ued for the military tenants to a&s;&s;emble their whole &s;ervice at Newca&s;tle in the middle of May. A na|val force was ordered to lie at the mouth of Tees, near Skinburne&s;s; and the king particularly reque&s;ted, that the cities and great towns would furni&s;h hor&s;emen, mounted on cavalry of 30 or 40 &s;hillings price. Negociations for a peace proved abortive: The king, with the royal family, came down to York: The Scots made an inroad about the middle of June, and were repelled. But this was a trivial bu|&s;ine&s;s to what immediately &s;ucceeded; for the earl of Murray and Lord Douglas, at the head of a large army, in which we are told were 24,000 hor&s;emen, entered Cumberland in the month of July, and harra&s;&s;ed the we&s;tern parts of Northum|berland
<PB N="273" REF="320">and Durham, by the mountainous pa&s;&s;es, which, from repeated incur&s;ions, they were well acquainted with. On the 15th day of July the king was at Durham, with an army of 100,000 men, and u&s;ed every effort to meet with the enemy, but in vain. This immen&s;e multitude, encumbered with heavy baggage, could not pur&s;ue the Scots through the mountains and wa&s;tes which they traver&s;ed, and where every defile was known to them. After &s;uffering innumerable hard&s;hips, without gaining a &s;ight of the foe, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, offering a reward of knight|hood, and one hundred pounds in lands by the year, to any per&s;on who would con|duct the king to a &s;ight of his enemies, in a place where it was po&s;&s;ible to give them battle. This was gained by Thomas de Rokeby, who di&s;covered the enemy in Stanhope Park. The Scots left the field without engaging, and made a precipi|tate retreat; the men in the rear threw away their arms for more expeditious run|ning, of whom many were cut off by a party of light hor&s;e in the pur&s;uit. The Engli&s;h army &s;oon after was di&s;banded; but the Scots continued their military operations on the borders; took Norham, and made an un&s;ucce&s;sful effort upon Alnwick. Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed to treat of peace; during which nego|ciation the king's nuptials were celebrated at York. By a royal mandate, directed to the bi&s;hop of Durham, the magi&s;trates of Newca&s;tle, and the &s;heriffs of Nor|thumberland and York&s;hire, they were directed to give &s;afe conduct and an ho|nourable reception to the delegates of Scotland, &s;aid to be 100 in number, in their progre&s;s to York, on the treaty. The Engli&s;h parliament, a&s;&s;embled there in the month of March 1328, opened the way to a reconciliation, by con&s;enting to a pre|liminary deed of renunciation of the king's claim of &s;overeignty over Scotland, and a full recognition of Brus's title to the crown. In return, the &s;tates of Scot|land engaged to pay into the king of England's exchequer 20,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year for three years, to indemnify England again&s;t the expences of the war: And the ar|ticles of peace were ratified in due form.</P>
<P>In the following year, 1329, the king of Scotland died, leaving David his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, an infant, little more than &s;ix years of age. The peace was &s;trictly maintained whil&s;t the in&s;luence of the queen-dowager of England prevailed: But young Edward, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great vivacity and &s;pirit, together with &s;trong mental powers, and a judgment &s;ingular for his years, &s;oon grew impatient under the in&s;olent de&s;poti&s;m and atrocious conduct of Mortimer, and entertained thoughts of removing him. Sir William Montague, to whom the king communicated his wi&s;hes, warmly encouraged the idea; and a plan was &s;ecretly projected for &s;eizing the obnoxious favourite in the Ca&s;tle of Nottingham, where he re&s;ided totally un|guarded, and without apprehen&s;ion of danger. He was conveyed to London, im|peached before parliament, and hanged at Tyburn. Lord Henry Beaumont, who had oppo&s;ed the favourite in his flagrant acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, and was obliged to fly for &s;afety into France, returned on this occa&s;ion. Soon after lord Henry's return, a complaint was made by the bi&s;hop of Durham, which he warmly &s;upported, touching the village of Up&s;etlington, which was an ancient part of the territories of his See, and had been &s;eized by the earl of March, in violation of the treaty of peace. It doth not appear that he received the de&s;ired redre&s;s; but circum|&s;tances
<PB N="274" REF="321">in this ca&s;e, as in &s;everal others, threatened a breach of the harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two &s;tates, and were occa&s;ionally &s;eized on by tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to di&s;turb it. Lord Henry Beaumont was led by other motives than the redre&s;s of the See of Durham. Cummin fell by Brus's hand at Dumfries: He was grandfather of the earl of Athol: His large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Scotland were held by the crown. Lord Henry Beaumont, by a &s;eries of fortunate incidents, had ri&s;en to great power; and he had made connections by which he entertained a &s;en&s;e of intere&s;ts very foreign to his brother's palatinate. By marriage with one of the co-heire&s;&s;es of the earl of Buchan, he &s;ucceeded to a &s;hare of the large po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of that family, the earl's mother being one of the co-heire&s;&s;es of the earl of Winche&s;ter. The earl of Athol married lord Henry's daughter, and had very opulent e&s;tates, and connections of the fir&s;t con&s;equence, in England. A &s;ecret de&s;ire to revenge the blood of Cummin, and recover his e&s;tates, apparently influ|enced their future conduct. A full relation of the enterprize which tho&s;e parti&s;ans projected, and put in execution, would be tedious and impertinent; it mu&s;t &s;uffice to &s;ay, the king of England publicly declared his di&s;approbation of ho&s;tile mea|&s;ures; and, when in open violation of the peace the confederates made a de&s;cent on Scotland, and in a &s;eries of victories gained an amazing progre&s;s in the coun|try, he cau&s;ed the e&s;tates of lord Henry Beaumont to be confi&s;cated. But their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, in a little time, a&s;&s;umed a countenance of the utmo&s;t importance; and the king, by the advice of his parliament, levied an army to move to the borders, there to act as occa&s;ion might call, for which the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies were granted. Whatever might be the king's private &s;entiments in the beginning of this affair, is hard to develope; but certain it is his ambition was now rou&s;ed; the &s;pirit of his grand&s;ire &s;eized his bo&s;om; he &s;hook off the principles of public faith and recti|tude, for the promi&s;ed glories of conque&s;t, and a bloody war &s;ucceeded. Edward Baliol, who joined the invaders, and who&s;e right to the crown they made their pretext for acts of ho&s;tility, to cover their ba&s;er principles, now a&s;&s;umed the title of king of Scotland, and entered into certain conventions with king Edward. Soon afterwards a parliament was a&s;&s;embled at York, where envoys appeared both from David Brus and Edward Baliol, when the conduct of the crown of England to|wards the contending parties, and the &s;tates of Scotland, were deliberated upon, but no ab&s;olute re&s;olution was formed. In the mean time it was thought expedi|ent to treat with the guardians and nobles of David's party; to whom it was pro|po&s;ed that he &s;hould do homage for his crown, and re&s;tore Berwick. Whether the court of Brus di&s;covered the duplicity which darkens this part of the hi&s;tory, is un|certain; but the propo&s;itions were rejected with di&s;dain. Perhaps much of the &s;pirit which the Scots di&s;played on this occa&s;ion, was owing to the misfortune which be&s;el Baliol, who, being &s;urpri&s;ed in his quarters, e&s;caped with great hazard of life into England, (half naked, on a hor&s;e without a &s;addle), over Solway frith. King Edward's &s;oul had kindled with a &s;lame not to be extingui&s;hed: His ambi|tion was wakened with &s;lattering hopes, and it was not &s;uited to the habit of his mind to relinqui&s;h any favourite determination for one unpropitious circum&s;tance. The year 1333 was u&s;hered in by ho&s;tilities committed reciprocally by both nations,
<PB N="275" REF="322">&s;upported by the determination of each &s;tate. Edward, to palliate his conduct, claimed to have received the aggre&s;&s;ion from the Scots. The Engli&s;h army was commanded to a&s;&s;emble at Newca&s;tle on Trinity Sunday, and the military opera|tions were opened by the &s;iege of Berwick. The king of England, animated with all the ardour of an heroic mind, the &s;ire of youth, and high ambition for the glory of arms, ha&s;tened to the &s;cene of action. He was at Durham on the 1&s;t of April, and there received Murray the guardian of Scotland, who was taken at Rox|burg, but would not acknowledge him&s;elf pri&s;oner to any but the king. The &s;iege was tedious, and wearied the patience of king Edward &s;o much, that whil&s;t the approaches proceeded in a regular mode, with a detachment of the army he &s;torm|ed and took the Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and penetrated Scotland as far as Scone, Dundee, and the neighbourhood of Dumbarton; and then returned before Ber|wick, which &s;till held out. The Scots levied a powerful army to relieve this im|portant place, and the famous victory of Hallidon-hill<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a full account of this battle and &s;iege, vide View of Northumberland.</NOTE> en&s;ued, on the 18th day of July 1333; after which Berwick was immediately &s;urrendered to Edward's triumphant army. And Baliol, with a body of choice troops, flu&s;hed with &s;uc|ce&s;s, entered and reduced Scotland, and obliged David Brus to &s;ave him&s;elf by a ha&s;ty flight to France.</P>
<P>But to return to the affairs of this palatinate, and attend to the conclu&s;ion of bi&s;hop Beaumont's epi&s;copacy. His intere&s;t was powerful; but, throughout the whole of his life, he appears to be in him&s;elf a very in&s;igni&s;icant character, both in church and &s;tate. Soon after the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward the Third, he pro&s;ecu|ted his claim to the forfeited lands which Edward I. had &s;evered from the palati|nate; in which &s;uit, the parliament, held in the fir&s;t year of the reign, adjudged, That the bi&s;hop of Durham, within the liberties of his palatinate, was intitled to the forfeitures of war, in like manner as the king is intitled out of tho&s;e liberties. The bi&s;hop proceeded by petition in the parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, before the king and council; &s;etting forth, that he and his predece&s;&s;ors, time beyond me|mory, had <HI>jura regalia inter aquas de Tine et Tee&s;e, et in Norham&s;hire et Bedling|ton&s;hire in com.

<P>The bi&s;hop's private character is &s;ingular; and, by the hi&s;torians who have mentioned him, is variou&s;ly repre&s;ented, and with much incon&s;i&s;tency. He was
<PB N="280" REF="327">of exalted birth, was well favoured in his countenance, but crippled and lame of both his feet, and a mi&s;erable figure for the pontifical dignity. He was &s;trictly continent, but in his other manners wholly laical. As bi&s;hop of Durham, com|manding that important province, in the bu&s;y reigns in which he pre&s;ided, he ap|pears in no commi&s;&s;ions of con&s;equence; which is a &s;ufficient proof of his want of capacity. Halt and maimed (as he was), he could not lead his own troops to the field, the lord Henry Beaumont being their commander when called into &s;ervice. There are in&s;tances to be collected of his imbecility of mind; and it is much to be doubted he had few endowments to boa&s;t; the blood of royal progenitors being his only honour. He &s;hewed him&s;elf, on every occa&s;ion, eager after riches, gra&s;p|ing at gold, yet, like a child, not a&s;&s;iduous to purcha&s;e the toy which had his affections: The pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed totally di&s;&s;imilar in him from that which agitates the re&s;t of mankind: The love of money did not bring with it the ordinary anxie|ties for its attainment; but, more than that, with his avarice he coupled a prodi|gality truly &s;ingular, in&s;omuch that, it is &s;aid, he was frequently reproached with his diligence as well to accumulate as to &s;quander his riches. He was particularly &s;evere upon the convent of Durham, u&s;ing all the devices of his re&s;trained capa|city to &s;queeze from their coffers the money he wi&s;hed for. Under a colourable repre&s;entation of the impoveri&s;hed &s;tate of his epi&s;copal revenue, by the Scotti&s;h war, he obtained a bull to appropriate to him&s;elf a fourth part of the revenues of the hou&s;e &s;o long as the war &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.

<P>The circum&s;tance in bi&s;hop Beaumont's character, that he was very avaricious, and at the &s;ame time very expen&s;ive, is not an uncommon one, nor is it difficult of ob&s;ervation. It occurs &s;o evidently with regard to &s;ome per&s;ons, that it cannot well e&s;cape any attentive mind.

The character of Catiline is, indeed, finely drawn, and the particular ex|pre&s;&s;ion is ju&s;t, picture&s;que, and beautiful; but the thought is obvious. Sallu&s;t could not avoid it in his de|lineation of that famous con&s;pirator; nor did it e&s;cape the notice of Cicero, who, in his admirable de&s;crip|tion of this incendiary, in his oration for Caelius, &s;ays, <HI>Quis in rapacitate avarior?

It is no wonder &s;o truly an unlevitical figure, and a man of &s;o weak a capacity, &s;hould have great dif|ficulty in obtaining his appointment from the See of Rome. The corruption of the apo&s;tolical character, in this in&s;tance, carries an idea to the heart of the hi&s;to|rian, which freezes up the channels of charity. Immen&s;e bribes, and the intere&s;t of the powerful crowns of England and France, were combined to &s;trangle all true religion and virtue. What a de&s;picable appearance this epi&s;copal object made at the time of his con&s;ecration! He under&s;tood nothing of the Latin tongue, the hi&s;torian &s;ays, and proves that he had not the pronunciation of a word of &s;ix &s;yllables; for, when he attempted to read in public, the bull for this &s;acred office, which he had been taught to &s;pell for &s;everal days together, he could not utter it intelligibly; &s;o that when he came to the word <HI>metropolitice,</HI> and hammered over it in vain for a con&s;iderable time, he cried out in his mother tongue, <HI>Soit pour dict.</HI> "Let us &s;upppo&s;e it read."

<P>Licence having been obtained for the election of a prelate, the convent dele|gated a certain number of the fraternity for making choice of a proper per&s;on to &s;ill the See; who, on the 15th day of October, nominated Robert de Gray&s;tanes, the author to who&s;e writings &s;uch frequent recour&s;e has been had in this narrative, who had the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and was then &s;ub-prior of Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Gray&s;tanes.&mdash;Ang. Sac. p. 762.</NOTE>. He was unanimou&s;ly approved by the convent, and received the metropolitan's let|ters proclamatory accordingly. On his application to the king for the royal a&s;|&s;ent, he was told by his maje&s;ty, that he under&s;tood the pope had ordained Richard de Bury, his dome&s;tic chaplain, to the bi&s;hopric of Durham; that he was very unwilling to give offence to the &s;overeign pontiff, and therefore could not a&s;&s;ent to his election. It appeared, that the king had not only applied to the pope in Bury's favour, but al&s;o wrote to the convent to reque&s;t his election. The bi&s;hop elect returned to York, where, after having held a con&s;ultation with the canons of the church there, and having obtained con&s;ent from the prior and convent of Durham, notwith&s;tanding the refu&s;al of the royal a&s;&s;ent, he &s;ays him&s;elf he received confirma|tion on the 4th of the ides of December; but Wharton, in his notes, on the 10th of November, in the church of St Mary's at York; and on Sunday following, being the 8th of the kalends of December, or, according to Wharton, on the 14th day of November, he was con&s;ecrated in the chapel of the archbi&s;hop's palace, by the archbi&s;hop, the bi&s;hops of Carli&s;le and Armagh a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the ceremony; and, on the Sunday following, he was enthroned at Durham. Having profe&s;&s;ed obedi|ence, as u&s;ual, he applied to the king for re&s;titution of the temporalities; but he was refu&s;ed admittance to the pre&s;ence, receiving a me&s;&s;age by the trea&s;urer, that as it was not cu&s;tomary in England for any bi&s;hop to receive con&s;ecration, or be confirmed without the royal a&s;&s;ent, in a matter &s;o unprecedented, and of &s;uch con&s;equence, he would give no an&s;wer without being fully advi&s;ed therein, and therefore would lay it before his next parliament. Soon afterwards, RICHARD DE BURY came to Durham, bearing the pope's bull, the royal letters of confirmation, and due proce&s;s for re&s;titution of the temporalities, and was immediately received. The archbi&s;hop of York, having had an in&s;pection of tho&s;e in&s;truments, wrote to the clergy and people of Durham, that they &s;hould pay obedience to the nomi|nee. The Melton Regi&s;ter &s;ays, he confe&s;&s;ed the con&s;ecration of Gray&s;tanes was performed in perfect ignorance of the pope's appointment. Bi&s;hop Bury's nomi|nation bore date the 14th day of October, A. D. 1333; he was con&s;ecrated the

He made profe&s;&s;ion of obedience on the 12th day of February, A. D. 1337. The convent did not think it expedient to litigate this matter, notwith&s;tanding many favourable circum&s;tances appeared on Gray&s;tanes' behalf, as the grievous expences attending &s;uch a &s;uit did not then befit the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the conventual trea|&s;ury, drained as it was by the injuries and lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the Scotti&s;h war; &s;o that they thought it more prudent, in this in&s;tance, to &s;ubmit to the higher pow|ers implicitly, than contend again&s;t an influence which promi&s;ed to overthrow the ju&s;te&s;t preten&s;ions they could plead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rob. de Gray&s;tanes.&mdash;Ang.

When he left Oxford he became a Benedictine monk at Durham; and, &s;oon after, from the public character he had, for virtues as well as erudition, he was made preceptor to prince Edward, afterwards Edward III. In 1325, being trea&s;urer of Guienne, when the queen refu&s;ed to return to England, on account of the bane|ful influence of the De Spencers, he &s;upported her and the prince with large &s;ums of money out of that exchequer, for which being que&s;tioned by &s;ome of the king's partizans, it became nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;afety to ab&s;cond.

When Edward the Third came to the crown, he loaded his preceptor with honours and preferments. He at fir&s;t made him his cofferer, then trea&s;urer of the wardrobe, archdeacon of Northampton, prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum
<PB N="286" REF="333">and Litchfield; afterwards, keeper of the privy &s;eal, which latter office he held five years, and was in that time &s;ent twice amba&s;&s;ador to the pope. On the fir&s;t audience he was received with the favour due to his di&s;tingui&s;hed learning and virtues. He was appointed fir&s;t chaplain of the pope's chapel, and was pre&s;ented with a rochet in the place of a bull for the fir&s;t vacant bi&s;hopric in England. At that time he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Engli&s;h benefices to the value of 5000 marks a year. On the &s;econd audience, he had certain powers granted him touching the promotion of clerks, and was allowed, whenever he approached the pre&s;ence of the pope or cardinals, to be attended with twenty clerks, dre&s;&s;ed in uniform ve&s;tments, and 36 e&s;quires, al&s;o in uniform. On his return from this &s;econd emba&s;&s;y, he was in|formed whil&s;t in France of the death of bi&s;hop Beaumont, and of the king's let|ters to the See of Rome for his promotion to the bi&s;hopric; at which, it is &s;aid, he was much grieved; and when William de Tykell, rector of Stanhope, men|tioned his &s;ending letters to the cardinals, and others, in his intere&s;t, to obtain the vacant bi&s;hopric, he an&s;wered with warmth, that he would never con&s;ent to any &s;uch applications for this or any other See. In 1333 he was promoted to the deanry of Wells, and, as mentioned before, in the &s;ame year, appointed bi&s;hop of Durham. He was con&s;ecrated on Sunday preceding the birth-day of his 46th year, by John Stratford archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in the abbey of the black ca|nons of Ceert&s;ey in Surrey.

<P>Amid&s;t all the confu&s;ion of the war with Scotland, our bi&s;hop is not named. Various were the events which attended the military operations of both nations, and the borders were imbrued in blood: But the bi&s;hop's character was not mili|tary: He was not at the head of his provincial troops, but &s;erved more e&s;&s;entially in the cabinet. Edward Baliol was rai&s;ed to the throne of Scotland, but it was an exaltation coupled with a va&s;&s;alage, which &s;oon grew intolerable. The Engli&s;h lords who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Scotland, in con&s;equence of the conce&s;&s;ions made on Baliol's acce&s;&s;ion, &s;oon a&s;&s;umed an arrogance not to be endured; and the new &s;ettlement was very early thrown into di&s;traction; on which Brus's party again ap|peared in great force in various parts of the kingdom. Whil&s;t matters were in this troubled &s;tate in the north, the bi&s;hop of Durham, with the bi&s;hop of Win|cha&s;ter, were &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the king of France, to treat about a croi&s;ade, then in agitation, and which was promoted &s;ome time before by pope Benedict; and al&s;o to treat of peace between England and Scotland. But ho&s;tilities were
<PB N="287" REF="334">not &s;u&s;pended. The war was pro&s;ecuted the following year, and many advantages were gained again&s;t Baliol's party. In the year 1338, the bi&s;hop of Durham was twice on emba&s;&s;y to France, but without effecting the terms of peace he was &s;ent to obtain. In this year the king pa&s;&s;ed over to the continent, with a large armament, to obtain redre&s;s of injuries by force of arms; and in his ab&s;ence the war with Scotland was feebly maintained. He did not return to England till the year 1340. In this year the Scotti&s;h army advanced to the environs of Durham, marking their progre&s;s with the u&s;ual depredations and ruin. A truce was made with France, in which Scotland, as an ally, was included, which put an end to the raging of the border was for &s;ome time; and a &s;econd truce with the Scots &s;ucceeding, it was not till after the return of David Bruce and his queen to Scotland from their exile, in the year 1342, that ho&s;tilities were renewed. In the la&s;t truce, the bi&s;hop of Durham was joined in commi&s;&s;ion with Henry of Lanca&s;ter, the earl of Derby, and others, dated 3d April<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. v. p. 306.

</LIST></NOTE>. From the authority of Froi&s;&s;ard, l. i. c. 75. the author of the Border Hi&s;tory has &s;aid, <Q>that David's re&s;entment of his own grie|vous &startq;treatment, joined to the bitter complaints made by his &s;ubjects of their &s;uf|ferings from the Engli&s;h, prompted him to engage without delay in the work of &s;eeking revenge, and obtaining repri&s;als for pa&s;t lo&s;&s;es and injuries. His &s;ub|jects fondly flocking around his &s;tandard, he &s;et out from Perth at the head of
<PB N="288" REF="335">a numerous army (60,000 foot and 3000 hor&s;e), and, entering England by the ea&s;tern border, wa&s;ted and &s;poiled, far and wide, the counties of Northumber|land and Durham. He laid &s;iege to Newca&s;tle, which was defended with &s;uch vigour by Sir John Neville, that he was &s;oon obliged to retire from it. He marched from thence to Durham, which city he be&s;ieged and took, and there gave a full vent to his revenge again&s;t the Engli&s;h, &s;paring neither &s;ex nor age, prie&s;ts nor &s;acred edifices. The king of England &s;eems not to have expected, or not to have had timely intimation of this attack of king David upon his do|minions; for there was no force near the march able to re&s;i&s;t this &s;udden and formidable inva&s;ion. As the Scotti&s;h army was returning homewards with great loads of plunder, they pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ight of the Ca&s;tle of Wark. This fortre&s;s be|longed at that time to the earl of Sali&s;bury; his counte&s;s re&s;ided in it, and his brother, Sir William Montague, was governor. The indignation of the garri|&s;on being excited at &s;eeing the &s;poils of their country carried off with impunity, a part of it, con&s;i&s;ting of 40 hor&s;e, with their governor at their head, &s;allied &s;uddenly forth, and attacking the rear of the Scotti&s;h army, killed 200 of them, &endq;and carried 160 hor&s;es, laden with booty, into the Ca&s;tle.</Q> The editor of that hi&s;tory, in a note, has corrected this erroneous account; <Q>the taking of Durham, &startq;and the cruelty and &s;acrilege David committed there, mu&s;t be a mi&s;take; for, as Tyrrell ob&s;erves, there is no mention of any thing like it, either in the Scot|ti&s;h &endq;or Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, in manu&s;cript or in print.</Q></P>

<P>A &s;hort vacancy took place in the See: The critical &s;ituation of public affairs induced the king to &s;upply the important office of palatine with all po&s;&s;ible expedi|tion; and it was effected in a manner which reflected much di&s;honour on the &s;ove|reign. The exerci&s;e of papal authority over eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices in England, had long been con&s;idered a great grievance to the &s;tate, and incompatible with the intere&s;ts of a people ri&s;ing rapidly in wealth and power, and making progre&s;&s;ive advances to a perfect &s;tate of liberty. The council had repeatedly oppo&s;ed &s;uch authority; the king had i&s;&s;ued frequent mandates for repre&s;&s;ing the in&s;truments of the See of Rome; and &s;everal laws were enacted to extingui&s;h the pope's juri&s;dic|tion over eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments: Yet, notwith&s;tanding, the king, to carry his wi&s;hed-for appointment to the See of Durham, made a flagrant innovation of all tho&s;e &s;olemn acts of &s;tate, by applying to the pope in favour of his &s;ecretary and keeper of his privy &s;eal, THOMAS HATFIELD.</P>
<P>The pope, who had ob&s;erved the conduct of the Briti&s;h &s;enate with much con|cern, fore&s;eeing that it would produce, in a &s;eries of years, a total exclu&s;ion of his &s;upremacy in that powerful kingdom, received the king's application with much cordiality, cheri&s;hing an innovation which flattered the See with new vigour, and &s;u&s;pended the growth of that inimical authority which he had contemplated with much anxiety. He immediately fulfilled the king's reque&s;t, and &s;ent a provi&s;ion for Hatfield<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Angl. Sac.</NOTE>. It is not &s;aid that this mea&s;ure of the &s;overeign occa&s;ioned any commotion in the council; the &s;ea&s;on was filled with complicated bu&s;ine&s;s, and affairs of the highe&s;t moment &s;oon after en&s;ued, to engage the energy and exertion of every member of the &s;tate. Wal&s;ingham &s;ays, this application was the greate&s;t di&s;grace to the king, after provi&s;ion had been made by the legi&s;lature to &s;ecure free elections. Many of the cardinals &s;poke very di&s;re&s;pectfully of Hatfield, as being a man of levity and laical manners: But the pope, from the motives before men|tioned, being determined to grant the king his plea&s;ure, replied, "truly, if the king of England had made intere&s;t for an a&s;s, he &s;hould have been gratified." This does not give the reader the mo&s;t favourable impre&s;&s;ion touching the prelate who&s;e hi&s;tory he is advancing to: But Wal&s;ingham appears to write on this mat|ter with rancour, and therefore gives le&s;s prejudice than a more temperate hi&s;to|rian.

Godwin takes very unbecoming liberties with this bi&s;hop, and &s;ays, that he was not only a mere layman, but a man of light behaviour; meaning, that he did not demean him&s;elf as a clergyman ought to do, which words have been mi&s;con&s;trued by other writers, who &s;uppo&s;ed him a mere layman indeed; but he was not only a clergyman, but a man of &s;pirit and a warrior.

Had the bi&s;hop been a man of &s;uch light behaviour as Godwin pretends, K. Edward, who it is univer&s;ally allowed was both a wife and good prince, would never have heaped &s;o many and great honours upon him as hath been mentioned. He &s;erved Edward in his wars in France, and was at the taking of Calais. His retinue and quota in the field were very con&s;iderable, being 3 bannerets, 48 knights, 164 e&s;quires, and 80 archers on hor&s;eback; and on his banner were di&s;played the paternal arms of his family, viz. ermine, a chevron &s;able, impaled with the See of Durham.&mdash;Collier's Ecc.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding Edward's threat, "that he would reduce Scotland to &s;uch de|&s;truction as &s;hould be remembered whil&s;t the world endured,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barnes, p. 268.</NOTE>" a truce took place for the term of two years. The Scots, who&s;e politics &s;eem in this aera to be calculated to amu&s;e, without any degree of public faith, violated the articles of treaty, as &s;oon as a favourable occa&s;ion offered. In the autumn of 1345, the French king in&s;tigated an irruption on the we&s;tern borders, in hopes of diverting the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h army, with which he was then &s;ore pre&s;&s;ed. The Scots entered Cumberland with a large force, under the command of Sir William Douglas, and laid in a&s;hes the city of Carli&s;le and town of Penrith, with all the intermediate villages; but their progre&s;s was &s;topped by the Engli&s;h forces collect|ed by the bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, Sir Tho. Lucy and Sir Robert Ogle, who obliged them to retire precipitately into their own country.</P>
<P>The following year yielded more laurels to the crown of England than had been acquired by any &s;overeign, in any aera of its hi&s;tory. In the month of Augu&s;t was fought the memorable battle of Cre&s;&s;y, in which prince Edward, (called, from his armour, the Black Prince) a youth in his 17th year, di&s;played &s;uch heroic intre|pidity and military &s;kill, as claimed the admiration of all Europe. The glorious victory of Cre&s;&s;y was almo&s;t immediately &s;ucceeded by the victory over the Scots, at the Redhills near Durham, vulgarly known by the title of <HI>The Battle of Nevil's Cro&s;s.</HI> The king of France had again u&s;ed his intere&s;t with David king of Scotland to make a diver&s;ion in his favour, in order to draw the king of England's atten|tion from the &s;iege of Calais, which he had opened with an ardour that threatened its de&s;truction; and for this purpo&s;e a large &s;upply of men and money was imme|diately &s;ent into Scotland. The king of England, jealous of &s;ome attempt of this nature, &s;ent his commi&s;&s;ioners to David, offering advantageous terms of compro|mi&s;e, part of which con&s;i&s;ted of a propo&s;ed re&s;ignation of the town and ca&s;tle of Berwick. The &s;tates of Scotland contended warmly for an acceptance of the terms; but David, fired with more ambitious views, and &s;pirited up to war by the influence of France, the ab&s;ence of the king, and the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of Eng|land, as to men, (Edward having carried abroad with him the flower of the Eng|li&s;h youth) he convened a parliament at Perth, and received their &s;anction for his projected inva&s;ion. He levied a large army, by mo&s;t hi&s;torians computed at 50,000 men, with which, in the beginning of October, he entered England by the we&s;tern borders. The &s;mall tower of Liddel felt the fir&s;t fury of his arms, where the brave garri&s;on, on &s;urrendering, were put to death with all the determined barbarity of inhuman &s;avages. He made his way through Cumberland, which &s;moaked in a&s;hes as he pa&s;&s;ed; and, by the &s;outh-we&s;t parts of Northumberland, approached the city of Durham, and encamped at Beaurepaire. Notwith&s;tanding the panic with which the country was &s;truck, at a period when the king was ab&s;ent,
<PB N="302" REF="349">with the generals of mo&s;t experience, and the country &s;tript of military men, the northern potentates rai&s;ed an army with all po&s;&s;ible expedition to oppo&s;e the inva|ders, who&s;e conduct had proclaimed, that &s;acking, plundering, and every &s;pecies of barbarity, were their determined purpo&s;e. The archbi&s;hop of York, the bi&s;hop of Durham, (who on this occa&s;ion di&s;played the provincial &s;tandard, the banner of St Cuthbert), the bi&s;hops of Lincoln and Carli&s;le, the lords Neville, Percy, Ha&s;tings, Angus, Mowbray, and Roos, the titular king of Scotland (Edward Ba|liol), Sir Tho. Roke&s;by, and the &s;heriff of Northumberland, at the head of an army of 16,000 men, obtained a complete victory on the 17th day of October, and took the king of Scotland pri&s;oner, at the place before mentioned. Robert, high &s;teward of Scotland, has been charged, by &s;everal writers, with treachery on this occa&s;ion; as he and the earl of March, with their retainers, returned imme|diately to Scotland after the battle, with very little lo&s;s of men. The blow was a &s;evere one to the Scots; they were deprived of their &s;overeign, and con&s;equently thrown into inte&s;tine di&s;traction; the chief body of their troops was cut off or ta|ken pri&s;oners, for the lo&s;s of the field was horridly aggravated by the &s;laughter made by Baliol in the retreat: Pur&s;uing the advantages, he penetrated a great way into Scotland, and reduced &s;everal important places to the Engli&s;h arms.</P>
<P>The king of England received the intelligence of this victory before the walls of Calais. Copeland, to whom the king of Scotland &s;urrendered him&s;elf pri&s;oner, was &s;ummoned by the queen to re&s;ign him to her di&s;po&s;al, which he with intrepi|dity refu&s;ed, having him &s;afe in the ca&s;tle of Ogle, of which he was then governor; alledging he would give up his charge to no one but the king of England. Not|with&s;tanding the queen's di&s;pelea&s;ure at this denial, the king received Copeland with great cordiality, and granted him a reward &s;uitable to the important &s;ervice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>After the &s;urrender of Calais, a truce took place between England and France, in which Scotland, as an ally, was included; and, during that &s;tay of ho&s;tilities, a treaty was entered into for the redemption of the captive king. Although the mo&s;t dreadful plague raged that ever this i&s;land experienced, in defiance of the terms of the truce, many incur&s;ions, by plundering parties, harra&s;&s;ed the borders for a con&s;iderable time, till at length, in the progre&s;s of military movements by the Scots, the town of Berwick was &s;urpri&s;ed. The war had been renewed in France, where king Edward was in per&s;on: Having received information of the lo&s;s of that important place, he in&s;tantly embarked for England, and arrived at
<PB N="303" REF="350">Durham on the 23d day of December, A. D. 1356; from thence he i&s;&s;ued a &s;um|mons to all the military tenants of the realm to attend him on the fir&s;t day of Ja|nuary at Newca&s;tle; from whence marching &s;oon afterwards, he reduced Berwick. On his advancing into Scotland, Edward Baliol made a formal &s;urrender of his crown and kingdom to him at Roxburgh, by delivering the diadem and &s;ome of the &s;oil of the land, as was the practice of tho&s;e times. The &s;everal in&s;truments made on this occa&s;ion are witne&s;&s;ed by the bi&s;hop of Durham, who attended the king on this expedition. The following year was rendered glorious in the annals of Edward's reign, by the &s;ignal victory obtained by the Black Prince at Poictiers, in which the king of France was taken pri&s;oner. It was not until the month of October in this year that the treaty was concluded with Scotland, for the redemp|tion of king David: In the commi&s;&s;ion for this important negociation the bi&s;hop of Durham was joined with the bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, and the lords Neville, Scroop, and Mu&s;grave.</P>
<P>The king of Scotland did not enjoy the re&s;titution of his liberty for any con&s;ide|rable time; he departed this life in the month of February, 1371, and, having no i&s;&s;ue, by virtue of the &s;ettlement of the crown made by Robert Brus, his nephew Robert was his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the fir&s;t of the royal line of Stuarts.</P>
<P>The di&s;turbances on the borders, in the remaining part of Edward's reign, were not momentous enough to claim a place here. The progre&s;&s;ive misfortunes which befel the Engli&s;h court &s;hed their influence over the whole &s;tate, and for a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time a melancholy di&s;piritedne&s;s and di&s;may locked up the active powers of the &s;ubject. As if Providence had decreed to da&s;h the mo&s;t ex|alted human glory with the greate&s;t bitterne&s;s, this illu&s;trious monarch, towards the conclu&s;ion of his life, &s;uffered &s;ome of the heavie&s;t a&s;&s;lictions human exi&s;tence could be conceived to &s;u&s;tain. He lo&s;t the affectionate partner of his throne in the year 1369, with whom he had lived for near 42 years in a &s;tate of the greate&s;t harmony and conjugal felicity. He was deprived of the heroic prince his &s;on, who departed this life in the 46th year of his age, when he had acquired the high|e&s;t reputation for his valour, his wi&s;dom, temperance, and virtue, leaving a &s;on, the apparent heir of the crown, an infant of tender years. The king &s;aw the ter|ritories he had won by his victorious &s;word &s;natched from his empire by the &s;ilent hand of unpropitious Providence; for what he gained by unremitting warfare and heroic deeds, were imperceptibly, as it were, lo&s;t without a &s;truggle in any wi&s;e &s;imilar to tho&s;e arduous labours by which they were purcha&s;ed. A &s;trange depra|ty had &s;eized the whole nation; an unbridled debauchery every-where prevailed; the women, de&s;erting the precious characteri&s;tic of mode&s;ty, that chief ornament of the &s;ex, &s;eemed to glory in the lo&s;s of their virtue, and became o&s;tentatious of the mo&s;t di&s;graceful conduct: Nothing was more common than to &s;ee them riding in troops to the tournaments, in ma&s;culine habits, and even military accoutre|ments. The vices of men were in all ages incitements to female mi&s;conduct; the vices of women were from the beginning the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of the depravity of men. The fair &s;ex, &s;tudious to gain the a&s;&s;ections of men, will a&s;&s;ume the $$hions which be&s;t effect their purpo&s;e; and at this time the exce&s;&s;es were enor|mous,
<PB N="304" REF="351">&s;candalous, and di&s;graceful to human nature: The terrors of a plague could not repre&s;s them, though it raged to that horrible degree, that in one burial ground only, within the limits of London, 50,000 were interred, who died of that dreadful vi&s;itation. The king was &s;eized with the prevailing vices of the times; he forgot the years he had experienced in the cha&s;te endearments of a virtuous queen, who had brought him twelve children; he fell into a degree of dotage amid&s;t the imbe|cillities of age, forgot all martial &s;pirit, and re&s;igned him&s;elf to the di&s;graceful dal|liances of an harlot, to whom he yielded the la&s;t dregs of love the poor remnant of life retained: He &s;quandered the public trea&s;ures to amu&s;e her depraved mind, with all the luxury, and all the diver&s;ions the age could produce; the money ap|propriated by the &s;tate for the payment of public debts was embezzled, and thrown away in &s;hows and tournaments, to entertain this concubine, whom he called <HI>The Lady of the Sun,</HI> and on all public occa&s;ions exhibited, &s;eated by him in a &s;plen|did chariot, followed by a train of female equerries, each leading a be&s;otted knight by his hor&s;e's bridle, whil&s;t his afflicted people deeply mourned the depravity and &s;allen glory of their &s;overeign. The prince of Wales lived to &s;ee this di&s;graceful change in the royal character; he u&s;ed his influence to correct the enormities he abhorred, and to remove the obnoxious courtiers who, with their poi&s;onous adula|tion, held the king in the fetters of folly: But death &s;natched him from the trou|bled &s;cene, to be&s;tow ineffable rewards for his exalted virtues. Confu&s;ion &s;oon &s;ucceeded; an in&s;urrection of the citizens took place, to repre&s;s by violence the influence of tho&s;e dangerous mini&s;ters the king had recalled after the prince of Wales's death. The&s;e alarms hurried on the approaching fate of Edward; he had already experienced many calamities, and the rebellion of his &s;ubjects was not the la&s;t he was to be afflicted with: He lived to &s;ee him&s;elf de&s;erted by all the world, even in the approaching hour of death he called in vain for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his flying dome&s;tics; and when life's la&s;t moments were &s;u&s;pended in the hand of fate, the woman who had &s;educed him from his honour robbed his apart|ments, &s;tripped the rings from his hands, and left him in the di&s;tre&s;sful in&s;tant of agony and di&s;may. He died in the 65th year of his age, and 51&s;t of his reign, A. D. 1377. The excellent qualities he di&s;played in the vigour of life and fulne&s;s of judgment, the benevolence of mind, the honour and virtue which he exhibited in every private as well as public capacity, render the picture of &s;uch ruins the more melancholy.</P>
<P>Richard the Second, &s;on of the Black Prince, on his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England, was only eleven years of age: During the remaining four years of our prelate's life, he does not appear in any public commi&s;&s;ion of di&s;tingui&s;hed tru&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid by &s;ome, that the only eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments he enjoyed, be|fore his appointment to the epi&s;copacy, were the prebends of York and Lincoln<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.&mdash;Angl.

<PB N="305" REF="352">this See, &s;o important to the &s;tate in its palatine juri&s;diction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This prelate was of a martial character, for in the year 1346 he had the command of a body of troops a$ Normandy.&mdash;Noble, p. 27.</NOTE>. He is de&s;cribed as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a noble principle, though rather tenacious: His per&s;on was venerable, tall, and grey-headed; he was portly in his gait and carriage, was ho&s;pitable and courteous, and charitable to the poor. He did not mole&s;t his monks or provin|cials with any oppre&s;&s;ive principles, or di&s;turb them in their rights or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: He lived in great familiarity with the members of the convent, delighting much in their &s;ociety; and under his government the church and his people enjoyed great tranquillity. A di&s;agreeable reflection &s;trikes the mind on reading the following &s;entence in Chambr&egrave; <HI>Honorificos viros diligens habere, et non pueros; equos pro vec|tura, non equuolos.</HI> Had not an enormous vice contaminated the private character of eccle&s;ia&s;tics in that age, there would have been no nece&s;&s;ity for the hi&s;torian, an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, to have noticed this matter as a cau&s;e of prai&s;e in the life of our bi&s;hop; or, if &s;ome of his predece&s;&s;ors had not been &s;u&s;pected of the enormity, he would not have had this &s;ingular eulogium on his character<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.&mdash;Angl. Sac. &s;o. 771.</NOTE>. He made &s;everal munificent gifts to the church, and in his time it received two of the greate&s;t ornaments now &s;tanding therein: The exqui&s;ite work which decorates the high altar was given by John Neville, and erected in the year 1380; and the throne for the prelates was erected by this bi&s;hop, under the arch of which he prepared his own tomb, and gave lands near Auckland, called Enknoll, for the maintenance of a prie&s;t to &s;ay ma&s;s there. He re&s;tored many parts of the ca&s;tle of Durham, which, from their antiquity and neglect, were in want of repair: He built a-new the Bi&s;hops|hall, and al&s;o the Con&s;tables-hall, with offices and other nece&s;&s;ary apartments thereto. The city of Durham, though placed on &s;o &s;trong a &s;ituation, and defend|ed with a wall, he &s;till further forti&s;ied by building a tower to the ca&s;tle. He erected a &s;umptuous palace in the Strand, London, (now the Adelphi buildings) for the re&s;idence of him&s;elf and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors whil&s;t attending parliament, or in their &s;er|vices at court, which he devi&s;ed by will accordingly. He rebuilt or repaired many other edifices belonging this See. Chambr&egrave; &s;ays, he founded the college in Oxford called Durham college, (now Trinity) for eight monks of the See of Durham, and eight &s;cholars, and endowed it with an ample revenue for the &s;upport of the monks and &s;tudents; but this appears to be an error, not only from what has pre|ceded in this work, but from the authority after mentioned: Tanner, indeed, has fallen into this mi&s;take<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 184.</NOTE>; but, notwith&s;tanding his great credit, the reader will re|collect, that, in the year 1290, prior Hoton, with the aid of the convent of Dur|ham, fir&s;t in&s;tituted a hou&s;e at Oxford for eight Benedictine monks, and dedicated the &s;ame to St Cuthbert<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Hi&s;t.

Bi&s;hop Hatfield di&s;tingui&s;h|ed his money by the &s;ame mode&s;t device his predece&s;&s;or Kellow had u&s;ed; how|ever, their coins are ea&s;ily known from each other by the &s;pelling of the king's name in the epigraphe of the obver&s;e, which upon the former bi&s;hop's is ED|WA, EDWAR, or EDWARD; upon tho&s;e of this prelate the name is always EDWARDUS, (which, Snelling &s;ays, was the mo&s;t u&s;ual method of putting the king's name upon the pennies, though &s;ome of them read only EDWAR, or EDWARD) and more particularly by the weight, which is the &s;afer way of determining them; for Edward III. in the ninth year of his reign, 1353, reduced the penny to eighteen grains, which was &s;everal years before our pre|late was elected: From the&s;e circum&s;tances we are enabled to &s;ix the pennies in the plate to this bi&s;hop. Upon the obver&s;e of one is this epigraphe, EDWAR|DUS REX ANGL. Z. with a coronet (the mint-mark, which in this reign fir&s;t began to be u&s;ed) upon the rever&s;e: It reads, CIVITAS DUREME; others read, EDWARDUS REX ANGLI. Z. F. with an amulet under the king's bu&s;t, and have a cro&s;s-patee for the mint-mark. The legend upon the rever&s;e is the &s;ame as on that before given. The &s;econd has this legend on the obver&s;e, EDWARDUS REX ANGLIE, with a cro&s;s-patee for the mint-mark. The rever&s;e reads, CIVITAS DUNELMIE. Probably there are others of this bi&s;hop's money, that vary &s;ome little from either of the&s;e types. We have no money coined in the city of Durham, either by Richard II. or by any of the bi&s;hops of this See, during his reign; the rea&s;on of which it is difficult, at this &endq;di&s;tance of time, to a&s;certain.</Q></P>

<P>In this prelate's time the excellent prior Fo&s;&s;our died, and was &s;ucceeded by Robert de Walworth.</P>
<P>The king's licence for electing a prelate was &s;o expeditiou&s;ly obtained, that the 29th day of May was appointed for the congre&s;s in chapter for that purpo&s;e; when, by Chambr&egrave;'s account, there was a very crouded a&s;&s;embly of electors; and it was determined, for the more &s;peedy di&s;patch of the bu&s;ine&s;s, to proceed by thirteen compromi&s;ers, cho&s;en out of the body. So great a difficulty aro&s;e in the choice of a proper per&s;on to fill this important See, that after &s;itting &s;everal days,
<PB N="313" REF="360">the &s;elect members reque&s;ted &s;ix per&s;ons more might be added to their committee; and this party, on Thur&s;day next after the fe&s;tival of St Augu&s;tine 1381, elected JOHN FORDHAM, then prebendary of York and Lincoln, and &s;ecretary to the king: Chambre adds, that this nomination was proclaimed in the chapter-hou&s;e, and afterwards in the church to the a&s;&s;embled populace, where he was unanimou&s;ly approved: No hi&s;|torian, before this in&s;tance, hath mentioned a procedure of this kind. Notwith|&s;tanding the above account given by my author, it is certain, that a provi&s;ionary bull was obtained from the pope, on the 9th day of September 1381, but by what intere&s;t uncertain; though, from Fordham's attachment to the king, it is probable it was had by that influence. He did homage, and received re&s;titution of the tem|poralties, on the 23d of October 1381, and was con&s;ecrated in the chapel at Lambeth by the bi&s;hop of Oxford, the bi&s;hops of Roche&s;ter and Bangor a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the ce|remony, on the 5th of January 1381; he made profe&s;&s;ion on the 18th of Augu&s;t 1382; and on the morrow of St Matthew the apo&s;tle, was &s;olemnly enthroned at Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.&mdash;Ang. Sac. p. 77$.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A revi&s;al of the innumerable errors and improprieties of the reign of king Richard II. in which this prelate was an active mini&s;ter, is painful to the hi&s;torian: Certain it is, bi&s;hop Fordham was one of tho&s;e in whom, during the king's mi|nority, he placed a chief confidence, and to who&s;e evil councils many of the misfor|tunes of that part of the reign are attributed.</P>
<P>The followers of Wickliff's religious principles now gained a powerful head, being e&s;pou&s;ed by the king's uncle the duke of Lanca&s;ter; but whether from mo|tives of piety, or the political principle of re&s;training the influence of the See of Rome, is not ea&s;y to determine: Tho&s;e who were enemies to the fectary and his followers, attempted to brand them with a charge of encouraging and abetting Wat Tyler's in&s;urrection; a rebellion more ridiculous in its circum&s;tances, and wor&s;e &s;upported, than occurs in the annals of any country, noted in hi&s;tory: The charge appears &s;till more futile, when it is con&s;idered that the duke of Lanca&s;ter was then on the northern borders, and incapable of abetting the project: Yet he did not e&s;cape the malice of the king's wicked coun&s;ellors, who a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;pread a report, that he had prepared to march at the head of a Scotti&s;h army, to attempt his ne|phew's depo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the corruptions of this age, is an in&s;tance of &s;ingular intregrity in the lord chancellor Scrope, who refu&s;ed to put the great &s;eal to one of tho&s;e imprudent donations, this prince was &s;o notorious for lavi&s;hly be&s;towing on his flatterers. He prote&s;ted again&s;t the grant as indi&s;creet and puerile, reverting to his authority from parliament, from whence he was entru&s;ted with the &s;eals; and that, not being an officer of the &s;overeign, but of the &s;tate, he had a right to check the youthful &s;al|lies of a prince, who mi&s;applied his gifts, and lavi&s;hed them on men notoriou&s;ly enemies to the con&s;titution.</P>
<PB N="314" REF="361">
<P>The king, who acted only by the &s;prings of impetuous pa&s;&s;ions, and the influence of tho&s;e who abu&s;ed his youth and weakne&s;s by the mo&s;t pernicious councils, granted a power to the bi&s;hops to per&s;ecute the new &s;ectaries, and impri&s;on them, as their prejudices or wrath might lead; which brought on a new &s;eries of tumults and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. He wre&s;ted the great &s;eal from his chancellor, and put it, with his own hands, to many of his injurious patents. The&s;e, and other &s;tretches of prero|gative and arbitrary power, greatly alarmed the &s;tate, and encrea&s;ed the dete&s;tation which univer&s;ally prevailed with the people again&s;t the court cabal.</P>
<P>In the year 1383, the Scots, taking advantage of the broils in which England was embarra&s;&s;ed, invaded the northern counties; and the duke of Lanca&s;ter, in re|taliation, carried fire and &s;word to the gates of Edinburgh. In the negociation of the truce which &s;ucceeded, bi&s;hop Fordham was in commi&s;&s;ion. On the duke's return from the north, new accu&s;ations of trea&s;onable devices were brought again&s;t him, and new engines employed, to carry on the dete&s;table machinations of tho&s;e who &s;ought to remove him, and be delivered from an eye of judgment, which was held over their wretched practices. The king con&s;ented to have his uncle accu&s;ed; and judge Tre&s;ilian, a man &s;o infamous in his office that it is to be hoped few have re&s;embled him, made offers to &s;econd the project for his de&s;truction, with the mo&s;t flagrant innovations on the laws of his country. The duke threw him&s;elf into Pom|fret ca&s;tle, and gathered round him a few brave followers to defend his life; which was at length re&s;cued by the influence of the king's mother. Taken into employ|ment again, he marched again&s;t the Scots, who were committing new ravages on the borders, and was &s;oon after followed by the king, with a large army: Had not the favourites been jealous of the duke's fame at this in&s;tant, and induced their &s;o|vereign to believe he wanted to draw him into danger, Scotland might then have been &s;ubdued: But the due mea&s;ures were retarded, the king's movements &s;low and indeterminate, and more confu&s;ion than re&s;olution was di&s;covered in the military operations; which allowed the Scots time to recover from their panic, and &s;tand upon their guard: The progre&s;s made in this war was of little con&s;equence; the country was &s;wept of provi&s;ions by the inhabitants, who retired to their mountains and &s;trong holds, &s;o that the Engli&s;h army was obliged to retreat from the famine which threatened them.</P>
<P>A French inva&s;ion was apprehended on the duke of Lanca&s;ter's departure upon his Spani&s;h expedition, under the character of king of Ca&s;tile; and &s;upplies were required from parliament, to &s;upport an army levied for defence of the country, again&s;t the va&s;t armament France had prepared. The commons were ready on this exigence to impower the king to act with vigour; but the influence his odious mini&s;ters po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, induced parliament to reque&s;t, that tho&s;e who hitherto &s;o grie|vou&s;ly abu&s;ed their bounty, and lavi&s;hed in enormous follies the public trea&s;ure, &s;hould be removed: And an addre&s;s was accordingly pre&s;ented to the king. Bi&s;hop Fordham, who, on his coming to this See, held the office of &s;ecretary to the king, and was now trea&s;urer, and con&s;equently privy to all the &s;overeign's acts, was one of tho&s;e obnoxious characters pointed at by the &s;tates, and required to be removed,

<P>The king, in the heat of youthful arrogance and impetuous pa&s;&s;ion, treated the addre&s;s with indignation and contempt, and &s;aid, <Q>To plea&s;e the parliament, he &startq;&endq;would not turn out the meane&s;t &s;cullion of his kitchen:</Q> What had not the &s;tate and con&s;titution to dread from a prince capable of &s;uch folly, and a council who could poi&s;on his mind with an influence &s;o pernicious! His ra&s;hne&s;s did not &s;top here: He retired to Eltham, and &s;ent his chancellor to threaten the commons into compliance with his demands: They, on their part, in&s;i&s;ted on his pre&s;ence in par|liament; and an open rupture was threatened: The i&s;&s;ue produced a declaration from the king, that as he &s;aw his &s;ubjects prepared for rebellion, he would crave a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the king of France, to reduce them to their duty. Nothing need be added to aggravate proofs of the pernicious influence, which could lead a weak prince, mad with pride, arrogance, and folly, to a declaration &s;o derogatory of the tenor of his coronation oath, and the duties of a &s;overeign. The exertions of the hou&s;es of parliament, thus be&s;et by treacherous and &s;educive minions, and the con|&s;titution attacked with the mo&s;t dangerous innovations, were noble and generous: The chancellor, with a few of the mo&s;t atrocious, were removed, and fourteen in|&s;pectors commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;upervi&s;e all public affairs.</P>
<P>A providential blow removed all fear of the French inva&s;ion; their armament being broken and di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm: This event induced parliament to ri&s;e: But no &s;ooner were the members returned to the country, than the king re&s;tored his favourites, with a levity, which renders his memory &s;till more odious: The duke of Ireland was recalled from bani&s;hment; the earls of Suffolk and Neville, and the archbi&s;hop of York, were re&s;tored to the king's bo&s;om: The duke of Glouce&s;ter, with &s;ome others, equally obnoxious to the favourites, were intended to have been taken off by poi&s;on; but by good fortune e&s;caped. After a multitude of aggravating acts, particularly the Nottingham plot, when it was determined to levy an army, and drive out by force of arms the lords who oppo&s;ed the king's coun&s;ellors and others, which cannot be admitted in rehear&s;al in this work, an in&s;urrection took place, and the king &s;ought &s;ecurity in the Tower of London.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e inte&s;tine di&s;tractions prevailed, in 1387 the Scots invaded England, and penetrated as far as the county of Durham, where they committed great rava|ges; but on their retreat, laden with &s;poils, they were intercepted by Hot&s;pur-Percy, who brought them to an engagement at Otterburn<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For a full account of this battle, &s;ee View of Northumb$$$nd.</NOTE>: The forces of the bi&s;hopric of Durham were on their march, but too late to en&s;ure the victory, which Percy was on the eve of obtaining, when a reinforcement of Scots, led by the earl of Dunbar, wre&s;ted from him the laurels he had reaped, by &s;eats of the greate&s;t valour and intrepidity, after he had &s;lain Sir William Douglas with his own hands.</P>
<P>In the year 1388, affairs of &s;tate a&s;&s;umed a mo&s;t &s;olemn countenance; the king &s;hewed an incorrigible vice of mind, and his mini&s;ters, &s;till pur&s;uing their injurious
<PB N="316" REF="363">projects, threw the whole nation into a dreadful ferment: And, in the &s;equel, a con|federacy took place, headed by nobles determined for redre&s;s; and who&s;e power &s;oon appeared too great to be oppo&s;ed. The king's a&s;&s;umed countenance of contrition was di&s;covered to be delu&s;ive and in&s;incere, and his promi&s;es of redre&s;s calculated to amu&s;e and deceive, in order to betray the nation into an un&s;u&s;picious &s;ecurity, till the duke of Ireland &s;hould &s;urpri&s;e them with a large armament, which he pre|pared to lead from Wales. The confederate lords, on full intelligence being had of &s;uch mea&s;ures, marched a body of their retainers, then in arms, into Lon|don; and a conference was demanded with the king: He was per&s;onally re|proached for his repeated acts of violence again&s;t the con&s;titution, and the treach|erous mea&s;ures he had countenanced to the injury of the &s;tate: On this occa&s;ion, he &s;hewed an irre&s;olution &s;o weak, and at the &s;ame time a mind &s;o wicked, that the confederates were prompted to threaten their proceeding to the election of a king, if he refu&s;ed to attend in parliament, and di&s;mi&s;s his evil mini&s;ters: Thus held by a coercion his coun&s;ellors had not taught him to dread, he appeared on the throne, a&s;&s;ented to the bani&s;hment of his favourites, among whom was the bi&s;hop of Durham: But it is remarked, that &s;ome of the king's mini&s;ters were admitted to give &s;ecurity, to an&s;wer whatever charges might be brought again&s;t them, and our prelate was certainly one of tho&s;e, as he entered a prote&s;t in the hou&s;e of lords in the en&s;uing parliament after-mentioned.</P>
<P>It has been remarked before, that the bi&s;hop's barons &s;erved him in the capacity of a privy council. This was the ancient Roman con&s;titution, of which we have one perfect in&s;tance remaining to this day in Europe, in the government of Jer&s;ey, where the old Roman laws are &s;till retained; five barons con&s;titute a part of the legi&s;lative body of that &s;tate. By the extract from the account of the bi&s;hop's re|ceiver, given in the note, the reader will &s;ee what per&s;ons formed the council of this province in the 4th year of this prelate's epi&s;copacy, A.

<P>It appears that the barons, by who&s;e influence bi&s;hop Fordham was removed, were determined to fill the See of Durham with a prelate who &s;hould not interfere in political matters, and that was a mere eccle&s;ia&s;tical character; for WALTER SKIRLAW, who was tran&s;lated hither, is not noted by hi&s;torians in any public capacity in &s;tate affairs, during his whole prelacy; and his life was occupied in works of munifi|cence, not limited to his own province only, but extended to other parts of the kingdom. He was of the degree of doctor of laws, of the univer&s;ity of Ox|ford: Was fir&s;t con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of Litchfield and Coventry, from whence he was tran&s;lated to Bath and Wells; and finally, on the 3d day of April 1388, tran&s;|lated by the pope's bull to the See of Durham: Both the in&s;truments were of one date, which removed Fordham, and placed Skirlaw at Durham.</P>
<P>During the many troubles of Richard's reign, though the nation was in con|tinual di&s;traction by the power of contending parties, and the weakne&s;s and per|ver&s;e principles of the king, frequent attention was paid by the legi&s;lature to re|pre&s;s the influence of the See of Rome; not &s;o much, perhaps, through con&s;titu|tional principles, as fear of an encrea&s;ing power, to the prejudice of political mea|&s;ures, during the un&s;ettled &s;tate of government, which repeatedly fluctuated from one prevailing party to the other: Notwith&s;tanding this &s;eemed to be a maxim adopted by all, yet when nece&s;&s;ity required a particular point to be carried, an in|novation was &s;ought by either party, and the holy See was called upon to aid the mea&s;ure: Thus it was, in the di&s;placing Fordham, and bringing in Skirlaw.

<P>The border war was much re&s;trained during this prelate's time: Soon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the See a truce took place, which was enlarged for a con&s;iderable number of years. Robert king of Scotland died in the year 1390, and was &s;uc|ceeded by his &s;on John, who a&s;&s;umed the name of Robert III. The un&s;ettled &s;tate of both nations greatly contributed to repre&s;s the military habit of the borderers; and it was not till 1399 that the Scots made an inva&s;ion, about the time the un|happy monarch king Richard II. was depo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Henry IV. having been elected to the crown, by the popular cry, without any examination of hereditary claim, marched with an army to the north in the year 1400, but made no other progre&s;s in Scotland than to lay wa&s;te the borders as he pa&s;&s;ed; whil&s;t the Scots came behind him, and in retaliation de&s;troyed Bam|brough&s;hire; he at length being obliged to retreat, from a naked and de&s;olate country, and agree to a truce. In the year 1402 ho&s;tilities were renewed, and the Scotti&s;h army advanced to the neighbourhood of Newca&s;tle, with the accu&s;tomed acts of rapine and ferocity: On their retreat, they &s;uffered a compleat defeat at Homeldon near Wooler<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">For a de&s;cription of this battle, &s;ee View of Northumberland, vol. i. p. 242.</NOTE>. In tho&s;e inva&s;ions, the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland &s;uffered &s;o much, that, at the reque&s;t of parliament, the king remitted all debts and taxes due to the crown<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 283.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1403 aro&s;e the formidable defection of the Percys, in which a revolt of Northumberland and Cumberland was dreaded, and that tho&s;e powerful provin|ces would annex them&s;elves to Scotland. In all the affairs of the north, nothing is &s;aid of bi&s;hop Skirlaw; whence tho&s;e matters, though of the utmo&s;t moment to
<PB N="322" REF="369">the &s;tate, become impertinent to this provincial hi&s;tory, otherwi&s;e than as a mem|ber of the kingdom at large.</P>
<P>On a per&s;onal quarrel between the dukes of Norfolk and Hereford, the king &s;ought occa&s;ion to &s;end them into bani&s;hment: The duke of Lanca&s;ter died &s;oon afterwards. Every powerful per&s;on the king thought obnoxious to his intere&s;ts was now removed, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his de&s;potic rule &s;eemed to be obtain|ed to his wi&s;h, when a general revolt of the Iri&s;h induced him to go thither in per&s;on, with a large army; improvidently leaving England open to the de&s;cent of the duke of Lanca&s;ter. The moment in the hand of Providence for the relief of England was arrived: A powerful in&s;urrection took place, and after every ba&s;&s;led effort of the king to &s;tem the torrent, whereby he was convinced of the dete&s;t|ation in which he was generally held, with a cowardice as abject as his actions were imprudent, the de&s;erted tyrant re&s;igned his diadem, and in the ca&s;tle of Pom|fret departed this life, either through ob&s;tinate denial of &s;u&s;tenance in the depth of de&s;pondency, or by the cruel hands of tho&s;e who thought it a virtue to deprive him of all future power of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the nation. Thus ended the reign and life of a prince, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were his only arbiters: He had not &s;en&s;e or calmne&s;s of judgment to form any political plan for a change in the con&s;titution; but all his actions were in&s;tigated by pride, arrogance, and folly.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Skirlaw, during his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the See of Durham, erected a new bridge at Shincliffe, and one at Yarm, for the maintenance of which he purcha&s;ed lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.&mdash;Angl. Sac. p. 775.</NOTE>. He al&s;o built a bridge at Auckland, and erected a noble gateway of &s;tone work, at the palace there, made a &s;trong tower to the church of Hoveden, for the &s;afety of the inhabitants on any inundation; and expended great &s;ums of mo|ney in the repairs of that church, whereto he added the chapter-hou&s;e, which is &s;poken of by writers of that time as a beautiful edifice: He erected the hall of the manor-hou&s;e of Hoveden, and was at much co&s;t in other edifices there. He was at the expence of building a great part of the tower of York min&s;ter, vulgarly called the lanthern, where his arms are now to be &s;een. He founded a chantry in that church, with an endowment for a chaplain to celebrate daily ma&s;s there. He erected part of the beautiful cloi&s;ter of Durham, in which he expended 600 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> whereof he gave in his life-time, and 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> at his death. He gave 330 marks towards building the dormitory to the convent. His arms are placed in &s;everal parts of tho&s;e works. He was con&s;tantly held, as Chambr&egrave; &s;ays, in great honour by his &s;overeign. To the&s;e we may add, that he erected a beautiful chapel called Skirlaw's chapel, in his native pari&s;h of Swyne, in Holderne&s;s, and founded a chantry therein. In 1403 he gave the manor of Rothyng to Univer&s;ity College, Oxford, for three &s;cholar&s;hips.

<P>As to the coinage of the palatinate in this period, Mr Noble &s;ays, <Q>The epi&s;|copal &startq;coins of Durham may, with greater certainty, be placed to their particular prelates, both before, and for &s;ome time after this period, than tho&s;e of either the archbi&s;hoprics of Canterbury or of York; and, at fir&s;t view, it &s;eems very practicable from the many private marks that are upon the Durham pennies, &s;truck during the&s;e reigns, to fix them to the bi&s;hops, in who&s;e epi&s;copate they were coined; but it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that there are many little peculia|rities in the type of tho&s;e of Canterbury and York, and al&s;o that tho&s;e minted at Calais and London mu&s;t have been legal; therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible to know whether the pennies of Durham i&s;&s;ued from the king's or the bi&s;hop's mints; and &s;hould they be epi&s;copal, an equal difficulty would occur to know which of the prelates they were coined by.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the reign of Henry IVth was turbulent and full of rebellion, and during &s;uch inte&s;tine troubles, the Scots were re&s;tle&s;s, and in plundering par|ties con&s;tantly harra&s;&s;ing the borders; our bi&s;hop does not appear in any public commi&s;&s;ion, on the northern affairs, until the year $411, when he was nominated with the bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, Richard earl of Warwick, Ralph earl of We&s;t|moreland, Baron Hilton, Sir Thomas Gray, Sir Richard Umframville, Alan Newark, and Richard Holme, clerks, to treat of a truce at Hauden-Stank: But the commotions which had recently broke out in the northern parts of Scotland, by the revolt of John of the I&s;les, prevented the appearance of the Scots commi&s;|&s;ioners.</P>

<P>In the year 1413, the king departed this life, <Q>after having &s;ufficiently expe|rienced &startq;the mi&s;ery attending the greate&s;t object of human ambition, when at|tained &endq;and held by inju&s;tice and cruelty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Border Hi&s;t.</NOTE>.</Q> He held the crown of England for upwards of thirteen years; a reign marked with much inte&s;tine di&s;tre&s;s, not only from the dreadful vi&s;itation of the plague, the inva&s;ions of the Welch, and the for|midable con&s;piracies and rebellions which agitated the whole nation, but from the repeated &s;acrifices to religion, and the cruel executions of the followers of Wick|liff's tenets. Rapin fays<NOTE PLACE="foot">n="&dagger;" Vol. i. p. 401.</NOTE>, <Q>When I con&s;ider the exce&s;&s;ive commendations be|&s;towed &startq;on this prince, I cannot help &s;u&s;pecting, that the glory of being the fir&s;t burner of heretics, and of protecting the clergy again&s;t the attempts of the hou&s;e of commons, were the main&s;prings of all the&s;e encomiums: It is well known, the eccle&s;ia&s;tics are as zealous in prai&s;ing their benefactors, as in black|ening their oppo&s;ers." "His di&s;tingui&s;hed character was an extreme jealou&s;y of a crown, acquired by means his own heart inwards revolted at, and pre&s;erved by &s;hedding a torrent of noble blood. The death of Richard II. will be an in|delible &s;tain to his memory: He performed nothing remarkable, to afford mat|ter for panegyric: The battle of Shrew&s;bury, is the only notable action in his whole reign: He employed all his thoughts in pre&s;erving his crown, and avoid|ing all occa&s;ions by which it might be endangered. This prudent policy ought to be the chief, if not the &s;ole &s;ubject of his encomium, as it was the &s;ole mo|tive of his actions, wherein nothing appears to render him eminent. Though he cau&s;ed Richard II. to be depo&s;ed, for u&s;urping an ab&s;olute power, he did not &s;eem, by his conduct, to have &s;o great an aver&s;ion for that crime as he pretend|ed, &endq;when it was his intere&s;t to expre&s;s it.</Q></P>
<P>Henry, of Monmouth, a&s;cended the throne, on the death of his father, with|out any que&s;tion touching his right to the crown, and was proclaimed by the title of Henry V. So far from being di&s;turbed by any competitor for the diadem, the earl of March was one of the fir&s;t who came in to &s;wear allegiance. The king, in his education at Oxford, under the care of the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter his uncle, had imbibed the mo&s;t excellent principles of virtue and honour; under his precepts he had gained an enlarged mind and liberality of &s;entiments, together with maxims &s;o firmly rooted, as to form the chief &s;prings of conduct, in &s;uture life. His fa|ther's neglect and jealou&s;y, for a time, threw him into a &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation; but he was no &s;ooner on the throne, than he di&s;played a mo&s;t active and generous mind. He is &s;aid to have called before him the companions of his youthful fallies; that he admoni&s;hed them with much &s;incerity, and then, with a &s;everity of virtue they did not the lea&s;t expect, bani&s;hed them the court. He &s;hewed an earne&s;t wi&s;h, at the very opening of his reign, to liberate the king of Scots, on honourable terms; be|ing &s;en&s;ible his captive, in the lifetime of his father, was a breach of common ho&s;|pitality, and his detention a political &s;everity, little con&s;i&s;tent with honour and ge|nerous

<P>The king gained the hearts of the Northumbrians, by re&s;toring Percy in blood, and to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his ance&s;tors, in his parliament held in the beginning of and year 1415. As the king meditated a blow to be given to France, he appointed the duke of Bedford regent in his ab&s;ence, of who&s;e privy council we &s;ee our car|dinal a member: By the duke's diligence and attention, the de&s;igns of Scotland were ba&s;&s;led; for after the king's departure, the Scots levied an army of 60,000 choice troops, and prepared a train of artillery for the &s;ieges of Berwick and Rox|burgh; tho&s;e fatal engines being then lately introduced in the art of war; but both the expeditions failed; and we hear of no other military progre&s;s, but mutual in|roads, by plundering parties on the we&s;tern march, in which Dumfries was burnt on one &s;ide, and Penrith on the other. The king returning from the glorious vic|tory gained at the battle of Agincourt, immediately appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to effect the exchange of Percy, who had remained in Scotland, from the time of the old earl of Northumberland's flight from Berwick, for Murdock Stewart: Tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners were chiefly men of this province, viz. Sir Ralph Eure, Sir Wil|liam Claxton, John Huntman, ma&s;ter in theology, and Richard Holme, licentiate in laws. In the year 1416, the king con&s;ented that king James of Scotland &s;hould vi&s;it his dominions, on delivering &s;ureties for his faithful return: The cardinal was one of the king's commi&s;&s;ioners on this occa&s;ion, to receive the pledges. In 1417, the cardinal again accepted the office of lord high chancellor, in which he continued till the acce&s;&s;ion of Henry VI. in 1422, when he re&s;igned it; but, at the reque&s;t of
<PB N="328" REF="375">parliament, re-a&s;&s;umed the &s;eals in November 1423, and in 1425, he &s;inally re|&s;igned.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the king was leading a victorious army in France, in the year 1418, Sir Robert Umframville, then governor of Berwick, with an army compo&s;ed only of men of the palatinate and Northumbrians, in retaliation of the injuries received by the Scots incur&s;ions, carried fire and &s;word through Tiviotdale and the adjacent territories. Harding &s;ays, he burnt all the ea&s;tern march, with its market towns of Hawick, Selkirk, Jedburgh, Dunbar and Lauder, and the fore&s;ts of Lauder|dale. The king of Scotland &s;till remained unliberated, he attending king Henry in his la&s;t campaign in France, from whence the Engli&s;h &s;overeign never returned, he departing this life on the 31&s;t day of Augu&s;t, A. D. 1422; having reigned over England little more than nine yerrs. His heroic character is admitted, by authors of every di&s;tinction. He readily a&s;&s;ented to every law propo&s;ed, which tended to encrea&s;e the influence and pro&s;perity of his people. He renewed the military di&s;cipline of his &s;ubjects, which was greatly neglected, from the time of Edward III.; and Rapin &s;ays, <Q>Never did the Engli&s;h nation &s;hine with &s;uch &startq;&endq;lu&s;tre, as under this renowned prince.</Q> He &s;ullied the glory of his reign, by yeilding too readily to the importunities of his clergy, to encrea&s;e the per&s;ecution of the new &s;ectaries in religion: Sir John Oldca&s;tle and his adherents falling &s;acri|fices therein. Yet whil&s;t this blow was &s;truck on a few di&s;&s;enters, in the year 1421, the power of Rome over eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices was mortally a&s;&s;ailed, by an act of parliament, attended with royal proclamations, and an exertion which promi&s;ed that degree of liberty to be well protected in future.</P>
<P>The infant prince, Henry VI, to whom the crown de&s;cended in the Lanca&s;trian line, was not one year old at the time of his father's death; the dukes of Bedford and Glouce&s;ter holding the regency, by virtue of the king's death-bed appoint|ment. The unhappy change induced the Scots to invade England, but with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s, that Holling&s;head, in contempt, calls the expedition <HI>the dirtin raid.</HI> The liberation of the Scotti&s;h king now became a matter of much deliberation in the Engli&s;h council, who hoped, from the courte&s;y he had received in England, and an attachment he had frequently expre&s;&s;ed, he would be induced to maintain peace: To engage him further in amicable principles, it was propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e Jane of Somer&s;et, the daughter of John earl of Somer&s;et, &s;on of John of Gaunt duke of Lanca&s;ter, and Katharine, daughter of Thomas Holland earl of Kent. This lady was James's cou&s;in, a per&s;on of extraordinary beauty, and for whom he had entertained a pa&s;&s;ionate affection. The &s;um &s;tipulated for his maintenance whil&s;t in England was agreed to by both &s;tates: The prince re|ceived his liberty, and in the &s;pring of the year 1424 the marriage was celebrated. The city of Durham was the &s;cene of the great fe&s;tivity di&s;played on this occa&s;ion: In March the royal pair came thither, attended by a crowd of the Engli&s;h nobility of the fir&s;t rank, and were met by a numerous train of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious per&s;o|nages of Scotland. The ho&s;tages for performance of the liberation contract were there received by the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, and the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecurities mutually exchanged.

The con&s;ervators on the part of England were, Humphrey duke of G$$$ce&s;ter, Thomas duke of Exeter, Edmund earl of March, Richard earl of Warwick, Henry earl of Northumberland, Ralph earl of We&s;tmorland, Robert lord Willoughby, all the Engli&s;h admirals, the keepers of the marches of England towards Scotland, Robert Umframville, and Walter Hungerford, knights. The king and queen of Scotland remained at Durham until the la&s;t day of March, of fir&s;t of April, and then proceeded to their dominions by Melros, at which abbey the Scots king ratified the treaty and convention concluded in England.</P>
<P>An alliance formed between the courts of France and Scotland, in which the dauphin contracted to e&s;pou&s;e king James's elde&s;t daughter, alarmed the Engli&s;h court; and commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed to enquire after breaches of the truce, to demand the money in arrear for king James's liberation, to attend a change of ho&s;tages on that &s;core, and take an e&s;timate of the e&s;tates of tho&s;e who were pro|po&s;ed, to redre&s;s grievances, and agree to a new truce. In this commi&s;&s;ion we &s;ee the cardinal bi&s;hop, with the archbi&s;hop of York, Henry earl of Northumberland, Sir Robert Umframville, and Mr Richard Arnold a cannon of York.</P>
<P>It appears the cardinal, after his re&s;ignation of the &s;eals, withdrew him&s;elf from the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, and gave much attention to his palatinate; nor is he &s;ound in any public commi&s;&s;ion after the la&s;t above mentioned.</P>
<P>By the intere&s;t the cardinal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;oon after his con&s;ecration, he obtained from the crown the royal charter by letters patent, dated in the eighth year of king Henry IV. (by way of exemplification or in&s;peximus of preceding grants) in confirmation of the liberties and privileges granted to the bi&s;hops by the &s;everal potentates, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this See.

<P>In this prelate's time, prior John de Hemmingburg died, and John We&s;&s;ington was elected his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The cardinal departed this life on the 20th day of No|vember, A. D. 1437, and was interred, agreeable to the directions of his will, dated 21&s;t Dec. A. D. 1436, in the chantry, founded by him, as before mentioned, in the gallile. A table of marble is placed on his tomb, on the foot of which his coat armour is &s;culptured as in the margin, but no in&s;cription.</P>

<P>A &s;hort vacancy of the See took place, before the appointment of ROBERT NEVILL, who was tran&s;lated from the bi&s;hopric of Sali&s;bury, by papal provi&s;ion, on the 27th day of January 1437. He was the &s;on of Ralph Nevill earl of We&s;tmorland, by Joan Beaufort, the daughter of John of Ghent duke of Lanca&s;ter, by his la&s;t wife Catharine Swinford.</P>
<P>During the vacancy of the See, Richard Nevil earl of Sali&s;bury held the guar|dian&s;hip, by the king's appointment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;ene&s;cal, &s;heriff, and e&s;cheator, were al&s;o appointed by him.</NOTE>. The prelate did homage, and received the temporalties, on the 8th day of April 1438: He was con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of Sali&s;|bury in the year 1427, and in that See di&s;covered a peaceful and benevolent di&s;|po&s;ition. In the royal letter to the pope, requiring his tran&s;lation, he is &s;tiled "<HI>Con&s;anguinum &s;uum chari&s;&s;imum, ex praeclari&s;&s;ima familia oriundum</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">W. de Chambre.&mdash;Ang.

<P>By repeated truces the affairs of the borders were kept in a tolerable quiet &s;tate, and no open rupture took place during this prelate's time: Scotland had received a &s;evere blow in the murder of king James I. on who&s;e death an infant prince (James II.) acceded, then only &s;even years of age: The minority of this &s;overeign, and the weakne&s;s of the wretched king of England, occa&s;ioned both &s;tates to cheri&s;h terms of peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev'end father in God, right tru&s;ty and right well beloved cou&s;in, we grete you well: And albeit that p'clamac'on was late yt all man'er p'&s;ons born in Scotland &s;h'd void out of the p'tyes of the north from Trent forth, or el&s;e to come in to the p'tyes of this &s;ide Trent, yet nathele&s;s for diver&s;e con&s;i's &amp; cau&s;es &s;hewed unto us, we late you wete hit is agreable unto us that by your di&s;crecon all that be within your franchi&s;e of the county palatine of Dure&s;ine abide &s;till therein, ye &s;aid p'clamac'on notwith&s;tanding.

<P>Our bi&s;hop appears in &s;everal commi&s;&s;ions for negociating truces with Scotland, particularly in 1449 and 1451; and the city of Durham was, in his time, the &s;eat of many conventions of the delegates of the two nations<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Border Hi&s;t. p. 407, 408, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding the turbulent &s;tate in which England was involved, under the unhappy influence of the queen and her favourites, the duke of Suffolk, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or the duke of Somer&s;et; and the in&s;urrection of the duke of York, at the head of who&s;e adherents were the earl of Sali&s;bury and his &s;on, &s;hortly afterwards earl of War|wick, by intermarriage with Ann Beauchamp, heire&s;s of that title; yet it does not appear the bi&s;hop of Durham or his province was in any manner engaged in the momentous events which took place in that aera. It is therefore difficult to form any competent idea of this prelate's character, other than that he appears to have been a lover of religious peace and retirement.</P>
<P>The only public edifice attributed to bi&s;hop Nevill, is the building on the Palace Green, now called the Exchequer, over the door of which his arms are placed. This place was con&s;tructed to contain the palatine offices, with halls for holding the &s;ittings of the bi&s;hop's chancery and court of pleas. The temporal chancellor of the province &s;till &s;its there.</P>
<P>In the year 1448 the king made a pilgrimage to the &s;hrine of St Cuthbert, but on what occa&s;ion is not &s;aid.

In the year 1459, the queen's &s;ucce&s;s induced her to a fatal mea&s;ure again&s;t her intere&s;t, by proceeding to con|fi&s;cate the e&s;tates of the duke of York and his adherents, in a parliament convened at Coventry, and to condemn to death &s;ome of tho&s;e per&s;ons who had appeared in his intere&s;t. There was too much &s;ecret rancour in the hearts of her &s;ubjects, again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures of her favourites, and too much affection for the &s;uffering lords, who &s;truggled again&s;t the ba&s;e principles of government, to al|low a mea&s;ure of this rigorous nature to take place and pro&s;per. The earl of Warwick, who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Barnardca&s;tle, equipped a fleet at Calais, &s;ur|pri&s;ed the king's &s;hips, which lay at Sandwich with &s;uccours on board for the duke of Somer&s;et, and pa&s;&s;ed therewith over into Ireland: He was one of the objects of the queen's &s;evere re&s;entment in the parliament of Coventry, and imme|diately after, the earl's e&s;tates in this province were in the hands of the bi&s;hop of Durham, as forfeitures; and he appointed John lord Nevill con&s;table of the ca&s;tle of Barnardca&s;tle, and ma&s;ter of the fore&s;t of Tee&s;dale, with a &s;tipend of 20 marks yearly, to be paid out of the i&s;&s;ues of the lord&s;hip of Barnardca&s;tle, by the hands of his receiver there; and he appointed Geoffrey Middleton, then high|&s;heriff of Durham, keeper of the park of Barnardca&s;tle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2d Jan. 1459.

<P>James king of Scotland was induced, by the confu&s;ion in which he &s;aw England involved, to attempt the recovery of Roxburgh and Berwick; and, at the &s;iege of the former, died by the bur&s;ting of a piece of ordnance, to which he &s;tood near, delighting much in &s;uch martial operations. This threw the Scotti&s;h nation into great di&s;tre&s;s, the heir to the crown, James III, being then only &s;even years of age, and con&s;equently that &s;tate was de&s;irous of remaining quiet during the inte&s;tine troubles of the &s;i&s;ter kingdom.</P>
<P>In the parliament which &s;ucceeded the king's captivity, it was re&s;olved, that Henry &s;hould hold the crown during his life, and the duke of York be declared his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ed into a law. The queen, anxious for the intere&s;t of her &s;on, made efforts to recover her influence, and levied a con&s;iderable body of forces north of Trent, who were induced to follow her fortunes by a promi&s;e that they &s;hould be allowed to plunder in their progre&s;s. With the&s;e &s;he advanced &s;outhward, gave the duke of York battle near Wakefield, on the 30th of Decem|ber 1460, and obtained a complete victory, the duke falling in the field: His younge&s;t &s;on the earl of Rutland, a youth about twelve years of age, flying with his governor, was pur&s;ued by lord Clifford, who, regardle&s;s of his tender years, plunged a dagger to his heart. The earl of Sali&s;bury was taken pri&s;oner, and be|headed at Pomfret. The duke's elde&s;t &s;on, the earl of March, had levied forces in Wales, whil&s;t the earl of Warwick, with a con&s;iderable army, guarded London. In the earl's route he fell in with a detachment of the queen's troops, in Hereford|&s;hire, and routed them; yet the queen, with an intrepidity as heroic as ever di&s;|tingui&s;hed any of her &s;ex, marched forward towards London, undaunted with the ill &s;ucce&s;s of that part of her army over which the earl of March was victorious, and, joining battle with the earl of Warwick near St Albans, prevailed, and reco|vered po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the king. But this &s;ucce&s;s was &s;oon blighted by the approach of the earl of March, who&s;e &s;uperior &s;trength &s;he dur&s;t not engage, e&s;pecially un|der the prejudices which prevailed again&s;t her troops on every hand, for their cruelty, licentiou&s;ne&s;s and rapine: She therefore fled with all &s;peed to the north,

<P>The queen, under each rever&s;e of fortune, di&s;played a mind replete with energy and fortitude. The northern counties retained their loyalty to the Lanca&s;trian intere&s;t, and their affection for a race of princes, under whom they had enjoyed &s;o many marks of royal favour. The army which the queen had now reinforced con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixty thou&s;and cho&s;en men, inured to a laborious and hardy life, and ca|pable of great exertions. Edward &s;aw him&s;elf &s;eated on a throne which mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be &s;upported by arms, whil&s;t the remains of the Lanca&s;trian family oppo&s;ed his intere&s;ts. He levied an army, and marched northward, a few days after his proclamation, his coronation being po&s;tponed to a future time. After &s;everal &s;kir|mi&s;hes, with various &s;ucce&s;s, the battle of Towton-field, on the 20th of March, being Palm-Sunday, brought to an i&s;&s;ue the claim of the competitors. An acci|dent gave great advantage to Edward's army: A fall of &s;now beat fiercely in the faces of the Lanca&s;trian troops, and deprived them of the execution their bowmen u&s;ually had performed, by their not being able to di&s;cern the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tance, to give their arrows effect. A clo&s;e fight &s;ucceeded the di&s;charge of arrows; and the dreadful conflict la&s;ted from morning till evening, during which time Victory often &s;hifted her bloody pinion from party to party, and hovered over each heroic pha|lanx with a tremendous uncertainty. At length the Lanca&s;trian line gave way, but fighting in the retreat &s;u&s;pended the event, and yet rendered it &s;till dubious,
<PB N="347" REF="394">till at length a panic prevailed, and the rout began. A horrid &s;laughter en&s;ued: The flying troops were cut down by a cruelty of prudence, which obliged Edward to give no quarter, that he might not be encumbered with pri&s;oners. The calamities of the di&s;comfited army were rendered complete by an attempt to cro&s;s the river; when the Wherf received &s;uch multitudes, that the dead formed a bridge for the living: There fell no le&s;s a number than 36,776 in this battle. The earls of Northumberland and We&s;tmorland (whom the bi&s;hop had before appointed con&s;table of Barnardca&s;tle) were among the &s;lain. Henry and his queen found means to e&s;cape from York, where they waited the event of this battle, and took refuge in Edinburgh. King Edward marched to York, whil&s;t the earl of Warwick had it in command to reduce &s;uch fortre&s;&s;es in the north as were in the hands of his adver&s;aries; but he was content with the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a few, and left the ca&s;tles of Northumberland una&s;&s;ailed. In June following Edward was crowned, and, in a parliament convoked &s;oon afterwards, the revolution was confirmed, and &s;uch acts as were made by Henry VI. during a reign of thirty years, were totally repealed and annulled.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t queen Margaret was in Scotland, &s;he was a&s;&s;iduous in negociating with that &s;tate a renewal of her intere&s;t: She made a formal &s;urrender of Berwick to the Scots, and contracted Edward her &s;on with Margaret the king's &s;i&s;ter. K. Ed|ward had propo&s;ed a new truce, but was baffled in his projects by the conduct and addre&s;s of the queen, who &s;till retained an a&s;cendancy at that court, &s;o that he was induced to enter into a compact with the turbulent earl of Ro&s;s, lord of the I&s;les, by who&s;e efforts he did not doubt to divert the arms of Scotland from any attempt on his northern territories. Rapin &s;ays, from the Public Acts xi. p. 483, that the bi&s;hop of Durham was one of Edward's commi&s;&s;ioners to manage this compact; and ob&s;erves, that its not being mentioned by any Engli&s;h hi&s;torian might probably be owing to its lying concealed among the records of England, till it appeared in the collection of the Public Acts. There can be no want of candour in que&s;tion|ing the authenticity of this part of Rapin's &s;tory, as the bi&s;hop of Durham was un|der Edward's di&s;plea&s;ure, mo&s;t probably for taking part with queen Margaret, and abetting her cau&s;e, previous to the battle of Towton: His putting the earl of Warwick's ca&s;tle of Barnardca&s;tle into the hands of John lord Nevill, by appoint|ing him con&s;table, was a &s;trong indication, if not an expre&s;&s;ion, of his favour to that intere&s;t. The di&s;agreement came to &s;uch a height, that, on the 7th of De|cember 1462<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot. B.

<PB N="349" REF="396">Mr Randal, in a MS. note, &s;ays, the cau&s;e of this deprivation was uncertain; but when the connection which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the bi&s;hop and the depo&s;ed family is con&s;idered, it is not hard to account for. Perhaps much of his temperance in &s;tate matters only took place after the correction before &s;tated. It appears indeed that he gained the e&s;teem and confidence of Edward IV. but the in&s;tances of royal favour derived from that prince did not accrue, till after the la&s;t efforts of his op|ponents were extingui&s;hed. During the bi&s;hop's di&s;grace, queen Margaret made &s;everal weak attempts to revive the cau&s;e of her family; and, in 1463, with the aid of France, and 500 men under the conduct of Brezee, &s;he entered Northum|berland; but nothing effectual was done, the troops were di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, and the general had a narrow e&s;cape. Soon afterwards, the Northumbrians and borderers, from their old affection, took up arms, and formed a powerful party; to oppo&s;e whom, lord Montague was &s;ent northward, with the forces which were ready to march, whil&s;t the king, with a large armament, prepared to follow, de|termined to retaliate on the Scots, who fo&s;tered and gave aid to his enemies. His lord&s;hip advanced to Durham, where he &s;taid for &s;ome reinforcements, and then proceeded to meet a detachment of the queen's army, which he came up with at Hedgeley Moor, and brought to an engagement: Lord Percy, who had &s;worn allegiance to Edward, but was in arms for Henry, was &s;lain there, and his party routed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Percy Cro&s;s.&mdash;See an account of this battle in the View of Northumberland.</NOTE>. The battle of Hexham Levels<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V de u$ &s;upra.</NOTE> &s;oon after en&s;ued, where Henry lay in entrenchments, with the main body of his troops, over whom lord Montague ob|tained a compleat victory; and the royal per&s;onages narrowly e&s;caped the fury of the &s;word. Edward, who had advanced no further than Durham, &s;ent the earl of Warwick to reduce the ca&s;tles of Northumberland, whil&s;t he proceeded on his re|turn to London<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">For a full account of the reduction of the c$$ll$$, $ee View of Northumberland</NOTE>. The &s;ucce&s;s of Edward's arms cooled the affections of the Scots
<PB N="350" REF="397">and French towards the depo&s;ed family: Edinburgh was no longer a place of &s;afe refuge to them; that court had agreed to a trace with England, and &s;ome &s;ecret articles were &s;tipulated which mo&s;t probably concerned Henry, for &s;oon after we are told of that family's departure from Scotland. The queen with her &s;on retired to her father's territories; and Henry, with a mind forlorn or vacant, wandered, in di&s;gui&s;e, about England, vainly &s;earching for a protector among his people, till he was di&s;covered by one of the king's party, and under many indignities car|ried pri&s;oner to the Tower.</P>
<P>Every circum&s;tance now con&s;pired to &s;eat Edward &s;ecurely on the throne, had he not cho&s;e to intermarry with a &s;ubject, to &s;atisfy a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and admit an influx of per&s;ons of inferior birth to the highe&s;t offices and dignities of the &s;tate. The earl of Warwick was negociating a marriage for his &s;overeign with the &s;i&s;ter of the queen of France, and looked upon him&s;elf as highly affronted by the king's ra&s;h engagement; but probably the jealou&s;y of others ri&s;ing to eminence without his approbation, wrought mo&s;t powerfully on his pa&s;&s;ions; and it was not long before the earl retired to the north, and George Nevill archbi&s;hop of York to his dioce&s;e. Rapin calls the earl "the proude&s;t lord that England ever knew;" and &s;ays, "his re&s;entment again&s;t the king, fired by offended pride, was irritated to its pitch by the &s;en&s;e he entertained of the king's obligations to him." In this retirement he formed a plan for the depo&s;ing a prince to whom he had given a diadem; and to that end he engaged the duke of Clarence, the king's brother, in the project, irritating his mind with the circum&s;tances of neglect which the king had &s;howered on him; and, to bind him in the compact, he gave him his elde&s;t daughter in marriage. An in&s;urrection &s;oon took place, compo&s;ed of men of York&s;hire and other northern counties, headed by Sir Hen. Nevill, &s;on of lord Latimer, and Sir John Conyers. The &s;ucceeding battle of Banbury was in favour of the malcontents; after which they were joined by the men of Northampton|&s;hire, led by Robert Hildyard. A &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es tended greatly to encrea&s;e this army; and the king, having levied in ha&s;te all the troops he was able, prepared to give the in&s;urgents battle near Warwick. A treaty for redre&s;s of grievances being propo&s;ed, the un&s;heathing of the &s;word was &s;u&s;pended; and under the hopes of a &s;peedy conciliation, the king was guilty of &s;uch negligence, that Warwick &s;urpri&s;ed him in the night, and carried him pri&s;oner to his ca&s;tle of Middleham, in York&s;hire, where he committed him to the care of his brother the archbi&s;hop of York. The king in a little time found means to elude the vigilance of his keeper, and e&s;caped. An immediate change of affairs took place in his favour, and all the projects of the earl of Warwick and his party were &s;peedily overturned, by the victory obtained by the king at the battle of Stamford, from which the duke of Clarence and the earl fled to France.</P>
<P>The earl, on this occa&s;ion, &s;hewed the great powers of his political and intri|guing genius, which no adver&s;ity could blunt, or di&s;appointment cool. He brought about a marriage between his younge&s;t daughter and Edward, &s;on of Henry; and then entered into a treaty with the king of France, who granted him aid, to attempt the re&s;toration of the depo&s;ed family. At the head of a few troops,
<PB N="351" REF="398">furni&s;hed by France, the earl invaded England, and had no &s;ooner made good his landing, than multitudes flocked to his &s;tandard, and he found him&s;elf in a &s;hort time in command of an army of 60,000 men. He cau&s;ed Henry VI. to be pro|claimed. King Edward, though he had treated all information of the earl's en|terpri&s;e with contempt, was in a few days obliged to fly for refuge to Holland, without having had a means of trying the event of a battle. Edward's queen took &s;anctuary in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, where &s;he bore a prince called Edward. All tu|mult being &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, Henry VI. was &s;olemnly proclaimed, and remounted the throne: But this dawn of pro&s;perity was only momentary, for Edward, having obtained a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the duke of Burgundy in the middle of March 1471, land|ed at Raven&s;pur in the Humber, with about 2000 men, and took his route to|wards York. By his prudent mea&s;ures, and the coming over of the duke of Glouce&s;ter to his party, without the hazard of a battle he approached London, where he was received with acclamations of joy by all ranks of people. The poor unhappy monarch, the mere &s;hadow of a king, in&s;tantly found him&s;elf a pri&s;oner, not having a thought even capable of attempting an e&s;cape. The enraged earl of Warwick, baffled and di&s;appointed in his mea&s;ures, and breathing vengeance on tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed his will, which he had not been u&s;ed to have controuled, marched his army towards the capital, determined to hazard all to the &s;word; and in the battle of Barnet, fought on the 14th day of April, being Ea&s;ter-day, he fell; and the fate of that field, immediately followed by the battle of Tewk&s;|bury, determined the unhappy cau&s;e of Henry and his adherents. Queen Marga|ret was taken pri&s;oner, and committed to the Tower, where &s;he remained, till re|deemed by her father four years afterwards. Prince Edward, a youth of eighteen years of age, was &s;lain in cold blood, and Henry was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Thus ended the life of that unhappy monarch, who had reigned thirty-eight years and upwards before he was depo&s;ed, having &s;ucceeded to the crown before he was one year old. Through natural infirmities he was incapable of governing; &s;o that his own misfortunes, and the blood&s;hed of his reign, may ju&s;tly be attri|buted to the froward temper of his queen, who&s;e impetuous pa&s;&s;ions engaged her with favourites arrogant and ambitious, without a genius capable of managing a &s;tate like England, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a ma&s;culine mind. Henry is de&s;cribed by Rapin as being remarkably cha&s;te and temperate; and adds, "he was extremely religious, abhorring inju&s;tice and cruelty." His whole character might be the con&s;equence of his weak frame; and the extreme of religion, being bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition, con&s;tantly marks only men of weak minds. Led by the machinations of others, it is but ju&s;tice to his character to &s;ay, that he was the innocent cau&s;e of the di&s;trac|tion and &s;laughter which marked his mi&s;erable reign.</P>

<P>Yere e&s;tre eigiven diver&s;e cons's &amp; rea&s;ons why the bpps of Dure&s;me in the times of kings of England Henry III. and Edw. I. aught of r't &amp; be cour&s;e of the comon laws then had within the bpprick, that is to &s;ay, in all places betwix the waters of Tyne &amp; Ty&s;e comonly called the bpprick of Dure&s;me, and in the places called. Norham&s;hire, Eland&s;hire, &amp; Bedlington&s;hire, be the rea&s;on of the liberty rihall, that thei within the &s;ame, as well all maner of forfauges, grewints, &amp; fallyn, be occacon of rebellion trea&s;on or warr again&s;t the king, which was then called for&s;ituctores of werre, as for any other cau&s;e what&s;'r it was.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, itt is to be con&s;idered, that in the days of the &s;aid kings, Heary III. &amp; Edw. I. &amp; long &amp; many y'rs after, no p'&s;on that had rebelled, done trea&s;on, or levyed warr ag't the &s;aid king, was y'rof attainted by verdict or auctoritie of parliamt. nor the king of the land the &s;ame time for any offence &s;eized any man's land, by any of the &s;aid authorityes; but that after the trea&s;on or rebellion was committed, the king re|c'ed the rebell to his peace, or elles refu&s;ed and denyed to him. In the 1&s;t ca&s;e, the party put his lands into the king's hands for the &s;urety of the keeping of the peace, and for &s;yne making at the king's will. In the 2d ca&s;e, that is to &s;ay, where the king would not rec'e his rebel to his peace, he forthwith feized his lands as forfeited to him by rea&s;on of trea&s;on done ag't his per&s;on, and this was called forfeiture of weire, that is to &s;ay, forfeiture for levying warr ag't the king.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is to be con&s;idered, that lands having then franchizes and libertys reall, by rea&s;on of the &s;ame, had forfeitures of warr within them, as the king had in other places of the realme without the $$d liberties, and as the king for trea&s;on comitted, &s;eized lands lying within the&s;e libertyes, all which they only did, becau&s;e, that the forfeiture of warr appertaineth to libertys, and that may and doth appear, as well by u&s;age and practi$e that then ran and was put in uze, as al&s;o by great rea&s;on, and the common law that then rann and yet doth. Fir&s;t, the &s;ame appeareth by of rea&s;on this, except it be by authority of par|liament, nor yet to be but to the wrong of the lord, unle&s;s it be by his a&s;&s;ent direct v$l indirect, the liberty royall cannot nor may not be denyed, &amp;c. for the lord, having liberty regall, has <HI>jura regalia</HI> (y't is to &s;ay) <HI>$$nta jura regalia, q. indefinite in jure equi&mdash;univer&s;ali:</HI> Whereupon it mu&s;t needs follow, that it the lord have <HI>univer&s;a jura regalia,</HI> the king, except by authority of parliament, as above, cannot have neither for|feiture of warr nor of any other forfeiture within the &s;aid liberty. Secondly, the &s;ame appeareth thus in &s;uch places where liberty regal is; there the king's writt runneth not, nor none of the king's officers nor mini&s;ter can or may by the king's writt nor other commandement entre, do any office, or &s;eize any lands by way of e&s;cheat or forfeiture; ergo, except it be by authority of parliament as above, they cannot with|$$$ liberty regall meddle with $o$$$ture of wa$$$. T$$rd$y, the $span$ $$$th thus in $word$ e$$$s of for|feitures fallen by the cour&s;e of the common law, &amp; without it be expre&s;sly o'rwi&s;e provided by authority of parliament, the lord &s;eizeth within the liberty regall as the king doth without, as thus, John at Style, lord of the manor of Dale within Midd, &amp; of the manor of Roke, lying within the bpp'k of Dure&s;ine, is attaint|ed of felony or of high trea&s;on by the verdict of the common law, like as the king in this ea&s;e, the king may &s;eize the manor of Dale lying in Midd'x, for the b'p of Dure&s;me, by rea&s;on of his liberty regall, may &s;eize the manor lying within the &s;aid bpp'k. But the forfeitures of warr in the days of the &s;aid K. Hen. III. and K. Edw. I. pa&s;&s;ed not then by &s;o great authority as they do now at the comon law; ergo, that the lord having liberty regall may now &s;eize lands of per&s;ons attainted of trea&s;on at the comon law: A fortiori, he might not &s;o do in the days of the &s;aid kings, when there were none attainted by any or not &s;o great proce&s;s of the law as be now. Fourthly, the &s;ame appeareth by u&s;age &amp; continual po'&s;&s;ion, &s;ince the time that forfeitures of warr were fir&s;t archieved, as in the time of K. Hen. III. during the barons warr Petrus de Monteforti, lord of the manor of Gretham, lying within the liberty of the &s;aid b'p'k, (that is to &s;ay) in the wapentake of Sadberg, betwixt the waters of Tyne and Tea&s;e within the bi&s;hoprick of Dure&s;me, for warr levying again&s;t the king at the battle of Eve&s;ham, what he was &s;layne, forfeited, not only the &s;aid Gretham, but al&s;o all the lands that he had within the realm of England: And al&s;o be it, that &s;aid king, &s;uppo&s;ing forfeiture of warr to appertain to him within the &s;aid bpp'k, as it did in other places without, &s;eized the &s;aid manor into his hands. The &s;ame king afterwards well under&s;tood of the right of the &s;aid b'p, re&s;tored to him the &s;aid manor, as by his l'res patent y^^i'rupon made to the &s;aid bpp it doth plainly ap|pear. This was the 1&s;t forfeiture of warr, whereof it now remaining in the manner of record. The 2 <ABBR>d</ABBR> forfeiture of warr was in the 21&s;t year of K. Edw. I. by John Balyol then K. of Scots, the which, by levying warr again&s;t the K. forfeited to the &s;aid K. Edw. all the lands that he had out of the realm of England out of the bpp'k of Dure&s;me; and to the &s;aid &s;ame b'p all the lands that he had within his liberty regall, which were no &s;mall lands, and into the &s;ame authority then &s;he bi&s;hop in right of his church of Dure&s;ine entred, and of them was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many years. Al&s;o one John Percy, adherent to the &s;aid John Balyol, by the &s;ame rea&s;on forfeited the manor of Witchlaw lying within the &s;aid liberty, into the which, the &s;aid Anthony (Beke) entred in the right of his church, and afterward gave it to John Fitz Marmaduc, all of it. Be the &s;ame manor afterwards returned into the hands of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the &s;aid bi&s;hop yet remaineth. Al&s;o one Americk Howden, adherent to the &s;ame K. of Scots, forfeited by rea&s;on thereof, all the lands and tenements that he had in Berrington and Keyley lying in the liberty of the &s;aid bi&s;hop of Norham&s;hire, into the which the &s;aid Anthony entred, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors is at this day &s;eized of part of the &s;ame; and part the &s;aid Anthony gave to Robert Manners, whereof the heirs of the &s;aid Robert be yet &s;eized. Al&s;o one Walter Fitz James, adherent to the &s;aid John Balioll, by rea&s;on thereof forfeited the manors of Bukton and Go&s;wyke lying in Eland&s;hire within the liberty of the &s;aid bpp'k, into the which the &s;aid Bp Anth, then entred, &amp; the &s;ame kept years and days, and afterward gave the &s;ame Bukton &s;o Roger Picard, and of the &s;ame his heirs be yet &s;eized; and the &s;ame Go&s;wick he gave to the prior of Eland, whereof his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors be yet &s;eized. The 3 <ABBR>d</ABBR> forfeiture was in the 29th year of the &s;ame king, by Rob. de Bru&s;s, then K. of Scots, by levying of warr agt. the &s;ame king, by rea&s;on whereof he forfeited to the &s;ame king, all the lands that he had within England out of the liberty of the b'p of Dure&s;me; and to the &s;ame b'p, all the lands within the &s;ame liberty, (that is to &s;ay) the manor of Hert lying within the b'p'k of Dure&s;me, into the which the &s;aid Anthony entred, &amp; of the &s;ame was peaceably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, till the &s;ame king, the 34th year of his reign, without proce&s;s of law, gave the &s;ame manor to Sir Rob. Cly&s;&s;ord. Al&s;o one John Selby, adherent to the &s;ame K. of Scots, for the &s;ame cau&s;e forfeited the manor of Fellyng lying within the &s;aid b'r'k, into the which the &s;ame Anth. then b'p entred, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors yet hath the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Item, the 3 <ABBR>d</ABBR> forfeiture of warr was in the days of K. Hen. IV. The 4th forfeiture in K. Hen. V.'s days, and the 5th forfeiture in K. Hen. VI. And howbeit, that the &s;ame were authori&s;ed by the autho|rity of parliament, yet ** fir&s;t were none other nor no longer, but as the comon law would; and the third was little gretten. And tho' no per&s;on attainted in K. H.'s days the IV. nor K. H.'s days the VI. $ad any land; or tenements with the liberty of the b'p of Dure&s;me, yett in every of the &s;aid par|liament was an expre&s;s of &s;pecial provi&s;ion for &s;alvation of the libertyes royall, &amp; by virtue thereof, the b'p of Dure&s;me in right of his church had the forfeiture of the manor of Win&s;ton, being within his liberty royall of Dure&s;me, &amp; belonging to the lord Scrope of Ma&s;ham then attainted; he had al&s;o the manor of Urp$$th., &amp; divers lands &amp; tenements in Con&s;et, Croldowley, &amp; Sedge&s;eld. And al&s;o the manor of El&s;lob, belonging to Sir Tho. Grey knt. then attainted, and part of them lying within the wapentake of Sadbury, where the manor of Hert lyeth. The &s;ame bi&s;hop had then al&s;o all the lands and tenements that the &s;aid Sir Tho. Grey had within his liberty royall of Norham&s;hire &amp; Eland&s;hire, to the value of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and above. $span$ forfeiture wa$$ in K. Edward's days the $th, by authority of parliament, by which it was ordained by expre&s;s words, that &s;ame K. &s;hould have all the lands &amp; tenements that were without the bpp'k of Dur|e&s;me and the b'p in his right of his church, all that were within the &s;ame, and &s;o the manor of Hert, whereof the lord Clifford was &s;eized at the &s;ame time of the &s;aid attainder.</P>
<P>Fifthly, that forfeiture of warr appertaineth and is appendant to liberty royal, appeareth by a judgment of parl. of K. Edw. III. the fir&s;t year of his reign, for howbeit, that K. Edw. I. without any proce&s;s of the law, and the party not called, gave to Sir Robert Clifford the manor of Hert, whereof Anth. Beke, then bi|&s;hop of Dure&s;me, by the forfeiture of Robert Bru&s;s, was then &s;eized, yet the &s;ame Anth. and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, (that is to &s;ay) Rich. Kellawe in the time of K. Edw. II. and Lewis in the time of K. Edw. III. &s;ued for their rights concerning the &s;aid manor in divers parliaments. The &s;aid Lewis obtained judgment thereof in the &s;aid fir&s;t parl. and had upon the &s;ame, writts, executories, as in yt ca&s;e appertained, the which judg|ments and writs are ready to be &s;hewed.</P>
<P>Item, the earl of Warwyck, and the lord Clifford, which oftentimes by bills putt to the kings and their coun&s;ellors, for that voiding and annulling of the &s;aid judgment, never could obtain their intent in that be|half, and in the &s;ame theyr bills, they never denyd forfeiture of warr to append and appertain to liberty royall, nor never for that cau&s;e de&s;ired the &s;aid judgment to be repelled, albeit, that it is to be thought, if it had &s;o been, y't forfeiture of warr had not in the&s;e days appertained to liberty royall, the &s;aid judg|ment would not have been obtained, nor would not have been forgotten, &s;o have been layed by the &s;aid earle and lord for the repealing of the &s;aid judgment.</P>
<P>And finally for a right grete, prove, that forfeiture of warr in the &s;aid K. Hen. III. and Edw. I. apper|tained to liberty royall, it is for a treughe, that wereas one of the hor&s;emen of the &s;aid K. Edw. I. by his negligent riding upon &s;ome of the cour&s;ers of the &s;aid king fell, and by the &s;ame fall was &s;lain, the bi&s;hop of Durham then being, had the e&s;cheat of the &s;aid hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Al&s;o it is confe&s;&s;ed by the lord Clifford in divers parts of the title, that he pretendeth to the manor of Hert, that the bi&s;hop of Dure&s;me hath <HI>jura regalia,</HI> for in the end of the &s;aid title he &s;ays thus as follows: Al&s;o it is to be remembered and con&s;idered, that the &s;aid lord can follow no action again&s;t the bi&s;hop in his own court, whereby he hath <HI>jura regalia</HI> to continue his &s;aid right, but is without remedy. Al&s;o in another ar|ticle &s;aid for his &s;aid title, he faith truly as followeth, Item, upon an act, &amp;c. 1&s;t K. Edw. III, it was or|dained, that the &s;ame bi&s;hop &s;hould have his liberty of forfeiture of warr, or he had be the patent of K. H$n. III. &amp;c. And that the king &s;hould ammove his hands of all lands being in his hands by forfeiture of warr being within the &s;ame liberty, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P></NOTE>. This change of at|tachment
<PB N="353" REF="400">may be &s;ubmitted to the reader's &s;entiments without comment. It was no greater difficulty to a bi&s;hop of Durham to forget his patrons and friends, for

The grant recites, that it had been immemorially the privilege of the bi&s;hops of this See to coin the former &s;ort of money, but never the latter. From hence it is clear, that this prelate was the fir&s;t that had a mint for halfpen|nies, and that not till this reign. Probably there was never any money of that value coined before at Durham; for though there were royal mints during the reigns of the three fir&s;t Edwards, after the Conque&s;t, who all coined both half|pennies and farthings, no money of either of the&s;e kinds have been found of theirs of this city. The bi&s;hop, by licence dated the 26th day of Augu&s;t, in the &s;ame year that he received his charter from K. Edward IV, gives permi&s;&s;ion to Wm Omoryche, of York, gold&s;mith, to grave and print two dozen of tru&s;&s;els and one dozen of &s;tandards for pennies, and eight tru&s;&s;els and four &s;tandards for halfpennies. By this we perceive that there was but a &s;mall quantity of halfpennies, in proportion to the pennies, and probably the coining of them was &s;oon di&s;continued by this prelate; for by another licence, dated the 4th of Augu&s;t following, to the &s;ame per&s;on, the latter was to grave and print three dozen of tru&s;&s;els and two dozen of &s;tandards for pennies, but no mention is &endq;made of halfpennies<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">From the clo&s;e rolls of the Chancery at Durham, Rot.

Upon the center of the bars of the cro&s;s, upon the re|ver&s;e, is the letter D, (which mu&s;t be read <HI>Dunelmen&s;is</HI>), from which, and the B upon the obver&s;e, we may be certain that this penny was coined by bi&s;hop Booth, in his mint at Durham. In the &s;ame cabinet with the above<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr Barker's, of Birmingham.</NOTE> are &s;eve|ral others, which vary &s;ome little from this: One has the letter B on the other &s;ide of the king's bu&s;t, which is &s;et &s;lanting, but without any pellets; the letter D is al&s;o placed as that upon N^o 1. &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;N^o 2. has this epigraphe, ED|WARD DI GRA REX ANGL.; upon the right &s;ide of the king's bu&s;t is the letter B, for Booth; the cro&s;s &s;ide reads, CIVITAS DVNELMIE. This penny has a ro&s;e upon the center of the bars of the cro&s;s, made like tho&s;e of the York mint. The ro&s;e, though differently made, is al&s;o the mint-mark; but it appears only upon the obver&s;e.&mdash;N^o 3. is the rever&s;e of a penny, which, upon the head &s;ide, differs not from tho&s;e i&s;&s;ued from the royal mints in this reign. The legend reads, EDWARD REX ANGLIE, and between the words are &s;mall cro&s;&s;es; the rever&s;e, CIVITAS DONOLI'; and upon the center of the bars of the cro&s;s is much &s;uch a ro&s;e as the mint-mark upon N^o 2. As there are no initials upon this piece, it may be que&s;tioned whether it was not coined by bi&s;hop Dudley, who likewi&s;e pre&s;ided over the See of Durham in this reign; but as the prelate who&s;e coins we are now giving was the fir&s;t in the reign of Edw. IV. it is more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that he would give the ro&s;e only, than bi&s;hop Dudley, who mu&s;t have been aware, that, as the ro&s;e had been the device of his predece&s;&s;or, it would be no di&s;tinction of his money with|out &s;ome addition. It &s;hould al&s;o be remarked, that bi&s;hop Booth copied the ro&s;e, as well as &s;everal other peculiarities which are found upon the prelatical coins of York, as will be &s;een hereafter. From the&s;e circum&s;tances it is appre|hended that this coin is properly appropriated to bi&s;hop Booth.&mdash;N^o 4. has this in&s;cription upon the obver&s;e, EDWARD DI GRA REX ANG.; the letter B is al&s;o upon one &s;ide of the bu&s;t, and a key upon the other; the rever&s;e reads, CIVITAS DERAME; the letter D, for <HI>Dunelmen&s;is,</HI> is placed as upon N^o 1.; and the mint-mark, if there was one, would be upon the obver&s;e only. Others of this type have the ro&s;e, in&s;tead of the letter D, upon the bars of the

On the &s;ides of the bu&s;t are the letter C, for <HI>cancellarius,</HI> and a cro&s;s formed of four pellets joined. The type of this penny was copied from one of archbi&s;hop Kemp, who, like him, was both lord chancellor and a prelate, and both endeavoured to expre&s;s their two-fold office upon their money: The rever&s;e reads, CIVITAS DONOLI. A coronet is the mint-mark, but it appears only upon the obver&s;e. The different types of bi&s;hop Booth's money were undoubtedly copied from the archbi&s;hops of York; the initial of the prelate's &s;urname, which we find on his pennies, is the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of the kind upon the obver&s;e of any of the Dur|ham money; the initial of his temporal honour is al&s;o (as has been ob&s;erved) copied from a York coin; and la&s;tly, the ro&s;e and key are both evidently bor|rowed from thence; for neither the ro&s;e nor the key have any connection with the Durham mint, but are both of them the proper di&s;tinctions of the money of York, particularly the latter. It is wonderful how differently the name of this city is written upon the Durham money, from the reign of Hen. III. to that of Hen. VIII.; whereas the cities of Canterbury, London, and York are &s;pelt with little or no variation. No cabinet, we pre&s;ume, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an halfpenny either of bi&s;hop Booth or of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, though we have &s;everal of their pen|nies: It is more ob&s;ervable, as Mr Snelling acquaints us, that the halfpennies &endq;of this king are common, and the pennies very &s;carce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr White, of London, who has &s;o exten&s;ive a cabinet, is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Durham halfpenny, nor did he ever &s;ee one.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>Bi&s;hop Dudley &s;at only &s;ix years, but it was a period in which the &s;tate &s;uffered great convul&s;ions, yet it does not appear he was in any public commi&s;&s;ion. The dreadful machinations by which Richard duke of Glouce&s;ter was opening his pa&s;|&s;age to the throne, do not &s;eem to have had any particular influence on the nor|thern parts of this kingdom, other than &s;uch as proceeded from the change of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in the large e&s;tates of the Warwicks. The duke of Clarence e&s;pou&s;ed the great earl of Warwick's elde&s;t daughter; the duke of Glouce&s;ter the younger, relict of the unfortunate Edward, &s;on of Hen. VI.; yet before Clarence's im|peachment, which was not till the year 1478, the duke of Glouce&s;ter was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tates of the Warwick family in this province. There is a darkne&s;s in this matter not ea&s;y to clear up, otherwi&s;e than by a conjecture, that in partition between the coheire&s;&s;es, the northern po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were a&s;&s;igned to Anne duche&s;s of Glouce&s;ter. It is certain the duke of Glouce&s;ter, in 1477, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Bar|nardca&s;tle, and obtained a royal licence to in&s;titute and erect a college within the ca&s;tle, for a dean with twelve chaplains and &s;ix chori&s;ters, with power to purcha&s;e lands for its endowment<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Pat. 17.

<P>In this bi&s;hop's time, Edward IV. departed this life; a prince who&s;e character was marked with a multitude of errors. His fine per&s;on and elegant carriage &s;erved only to render the depravity of his mind more &s;triking; his enormities &s;eeming to gain magnitude by the ob&s;erver's di&s;appointment, who, from an out|ward countenance, was flattered with the ideas of generous and noble actions. His cruelty was brutal; he never &s;hewed the lea&s;t compunction for the blood in which his hands were embrued; the image of mercy had not made an impre&s;&s;ion on his &s;oul, or the nature of the conte&s;t, in which he thought it nece&s;&s;ary for his cau&s;e to cut off &s;o many of the nobility, would have whi&s;pered it to his bo&s;om. The execution of his brother, the duke of Clarence, has not yet found a ju&s;tification
<PB N="363" REF="410">even from the depraved pens that wor&s;hipped courts in bloody ages. The want of humanity, and every generous feeling of the heart, was expre&s;&s;ed by the blow the ruthle&s;s tyrant gave prince Edward his captive, who&s;e only crime was his he|roic virtue. The king's courage and valour were not the effect of principle and virtue, but as the &s;avage ragings of the lion.

The duke of Clarence's children, being yet unpurged of their father's at|tainder, were e&s;teemed incapable of inheritance, &s;o that Richard held the diadem in a &s;pecious &s;ecurity.</P>

"What then is to be thought," adds he, "of the whole number of his ca&s;tles and other places, e&s;pecially in the time of the pre&s;ent mo&s;t grievous war, that we are carrying on with the mo&s;t fierce and hardy nation of the Scots?" He ob&s;erves further, that the ca&s;tles and towns belonging to the church at Durham were in &s;o ruinous a &s;tate, partly through the negligence of preceding bi&s;hops, and partly by the deva&s;|tations committed by the Scots, that the revenues of &s;everal years would not be &s;ufficient to re&s;tore them.

<P>In the &s;everal truces, and other negociations with the &s;tates of Scotland, the bi&s;hop is not named in any commi&s;&s;ion of this king. The troubles which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two kingdoms were confined to the borders; and the armed powers of this province, mentioned in the king's letters before noticed, were no other than the ordinary garri&s;on for Norham and other places of &s;trength.</P>
<P>The diadem, waded to in blood, was &s;oon wre&s;ted from the wretch, who&s;e am|bition had been gratified at the expence of every nerve of which humanity is framed. Henry earl of Richmond, of the Lanca&s;trian line, by a contract of mar|riage with Elizabeth the elde&s;t daughter of Edward IV, mounted the throne, un|der a plau&s;ible countenance of conciliating the di&s;&s;entions of the two hou&s;es. by uniting their claims: And &s;o rejoiced were the people on their relea&s;e from a ty|rant, whom hi&s;torians could not &s;ufficiently condemn to po&s;terity, and &s;o happily were they flattered with the idea of terminating the di&s;&s;entions which &s;o long had divided and di&s;tracted the &s;tate, that, without examining Henry's title, he was re|ceived with univer&s;al acclamations, and in the year 1485 rai&s;ed to the throne, by the title of Henry the Seventh.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop is not named in any commi&s;&s;ion in this king's reign; and indeed it is probable, in the rebellion of Lambert Simnel, aided by John de la Pole earl of Lincoln, in the year 1487, that many of the people of the palatinate and more northern counties, who retained their old affection for the Warwicks, were en|gaged in the in&s;urrection, and not without the countenance of our prelate. Hen|ry VII. made a progre&s;s per&s;onally through the northern parts, and carried on a &s;evere inqui&s;ition again&s;t tho&s;e concerned in that rebellion. In the bi&s;hop's re|cords, Rot. A. N^o 19, by virtue of the royal mandate to him directed, a com|mi&s;&s;ion is i&s;&s;ued to enquire <HI>de in&s;urrectionibus infra regiam libertatem Dunelm.</HI> The bi&s;hop of Durham was a&s;&s;uredly a per&s;on in whom the king put no immediate con|fidence; for whil&s;t he was in the north for the purpo&s;es afore&s;aid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rym.

<P>In 1488 the king was a&s;&s;iduous in levying the &s;upplies granted by parliament, and all the counties, except York&s;hire and the bi&s;hopric of Durham, readily &s;ub|mitted to the tax; but in tho&s;e parts, where the friends of the hou&s;e of York yet remained very numerous, it was not collected with the &s;ame ea&s;e. Some factious per&s;ons &s;tirring up the people, the collectors met with &s;o much oppo&s;ition, that they applied for aid to Henry Percy earl of Northumberland, then chief in power in the northern parts, who immediately gave notice at court, and demand|ed in&s;tructions: The king's reply was, that he would not remit any part of what
<PB N="368" REF="415">his parliament had granted, both on account of his pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities, and al&s;o to prevent other counties petitioning for a like relaxation. Upon this an&s;wer, the earl of Northumberland a&s;&s;embled the principal men of this province and the ad|jacent parts, and in imperious terms demanded immediate compliance. The de|termined phra&s;e in which the earl addre&s;&s;ed the people, &s;erved only to enflame the &s;ecret &s;entiments of their minds, which were already adver&s;e to the king's inte|re&s;ts; and in their wrath they conceived, that the earl had encouraged the king to this rigour. A mob in&s;tantly aro&s;e, and be&s;et the earl's hou&s;e of Cocklodge, near Thir&s;k, whither he had retired, and &s;lew him with &s;everal of his attendants. An enflamed populace &s;eldom &s;top at one act of outrage; their numbers increa&s;ed, their purpo&s;es were enlarged to more exten&s;ive views, and, &s;etting Sir John Egre|mont at their head, they threatened to march to the capital, and demand redre&s;s &s;word in hand. The in&s;urrection wore &s;o &s;erious a countenance, that the king di&s;patched the earl of Surry with &s;uch forces as were ready, whil&s;t he prepared to follow and &s;upport him at the head of a powerful army; but by the earl's alacrity the rebels were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed. The king, however, pur&s;ued his journey to York, where he cau&s;ed &s;ome of the chiefs to be executed; and leaving the earl lord pre|&s;ident of the north, and Sir Richard Tun&s;tal his commi&s;&s;ioner to levy the tax with|out remittance, he returned to London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is not certain whether the bi&s;hop was re&s;ident in his See at the time of the commotions occa&s;ioned by Perkin Warbeck; but it is rather to be pre&s;umed, he went over to the continent, on the &s;ame errand with &s;everal others, to vi&s;it the duche&s;s of Burgundy, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in council for the cau&s;e of the hou&s;e of York; for he died at Rome in the month of January, 1493; no rea&s;on being a&s;&s;igned by hi&s;torians for his journey thither; and immediately on his death being known in England, his effects were &s;eque&s;tered by the crown<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ob. ante 4th Feb. 1492.

From hence we learn, that the prelates of Durham had now lo&s;t the privilege granted them by Edw. IV. of making their own puncheons or dies for coining their own money, and were obliged to receive them from the trea&s;urer and barons of the exchequer, as was no doubt the cu&s;tom before the reign of Rich. III. As no halfpennies are here mentioned, it is probable &endq;the coining of them was now di&s;u&s;ed, and probably never again revived.</Q>&mdash; He gives a<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See plate of coinage, letter I.</NOTE> &s;pecimen of one of bi&s;hop Sherwood's pennies, and &s;ays, <Q>This is &startq;a very curious and valuable penny; the epigraphe upon the obver&s;e is RICAR|DUS REX ANGLIE; upon the king's brea&s;t is a cro&s;s, to denote that it is a prelatical coin; upon this &s;ide is the boar's head for the mint-mark, which was the u&s;ual cognizance of this king, and is the mo&s;t common mint-mark of any upon the regal money of this reign; the legend upon the rever&s;e is CIVITAS DVNOLM. Before we appropriate the money coined at Durham in the reign of Hen. VII. to its particular prelates, it will be proper to take a &s;hort view of the Durham coinage, and to lay down &s;ome particular rules to go by, in di&s;|tingui&s;hing the epi&s;copal money of this palatinate at this period. We have no money of this king's fir&s;t coinage, which repre&s;ents him with a &s;ull face, either of the Durham, or any other mint; but many of that city are to be found of his &s;econd coinage. It mu&s;t here be ob&s;erved, that the money under|went a great alteration with re&s;pect to the type in this reign; the pennies have always the &s;overeigns crowned, &s;eated in a chair, with the &s;cepter in one hand, and the orb in the other, with the king's name and title in the le|gend: This type Mr Snelling &s;uppo&s;ed was borrowed from the &s;overeign, of gold, as probably it was. Upon the rever&s;e appear the arms of France and England quarterly; and tho&s;e coined at Durham are almo&s;t con&s;tantly with the initial of the &s;ur or chri&s;tian name of the bi&s;hop in who&s;e mints they were &s;truck, on one &s;ide of the &s;hield; with a D for the initial of Durham on the other: By attending to the former, we &s;hall be certain to know to which of the prelates they belong. One of the&s;e pennies has the initial of both the chri&s;tian and &s;urname of the bi&s;hop, and mo&s;t of them have either a mitre or a cro&s;ier on &s;ome part of them, &s;till further to denote that they are epi&s;copal money; yet neither Mr Leake nor Mr Snelling appropriate any of the&s;e coins to any of the bi&s;hops. The fir&s;t gentleman, notwith&s;tanding the proofs above given of the&s;e letters an&s;wering to the&s;e bi&s;hops names, &s;ays, that they mu&s;t be for the minter, as they do not an&s;wer to any bi&s;hop of this See. It is well
<PB N="370" REF="417">known we have no mint-ma&s;ter's name upon our money &s;ince the reign of Edw. I. nor was it ever placed in this manner; add to which, we have con|&s;tantly a D for one of the letters, for <HI>Dunelmen&s;is,</HI> except in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, which has both the initials of the bi&s;hops names. Mr Leake is therefore mi&s;|taken in &s;aying, that they do not an&s;wer to any bi&s;hop of this See. The&s;e let|ters have nothing to do with the minter, but are either for the chri&s;tian or &s;ur|name of the bi&s;hop, and the name of the place of coinage. This is further confirmed, by our having letters placed, as the&s;e are, upon the archiepi&s;copal money of Canterbury and York; but as there were more bi&s;hops of this See, during the reigns of Hen. VII. and Hen. VIII. than of the two former, there is a greater variety of the&s;e letters upon the money of Durham, particularly as &s;ome of the bi&s;hops put the initial of their chri&s;tian, and others their &s;ur|name; one of bi&s;hop Sherwood's has the initial of both names, and &s;ome of the bi&s;hops have the fir&s;t letter of their chri&s;tian name on &s;ome of their money, and that of their &s;urname upon others: But what has mo&s;t confounded our antiquarians, probably is, that &s;ometimes the initial of the chri&s;tian name of one bi&s;hop an&s;wers to the &s;urname of another; and &s;o on the contrary, the initial of the &s;urname of one an&s;wers to another's chri&s;tian name; in one in&s;tance, two of the bi&s;hops have the &s;ame chri&s;tian name, and in another we have two bi&s;hops who&s;e &s;urnames begin with the &s;ame letter. We cannot however &s;uppo&s;e, but the&s;e prelates had &s;ome particular rule of placing the&s;e letters, to di&s;tingui&s;h their own money from that of the preceding bi&s;hop; and this is the fact, for by pur&s;uing the following very &s;imple mode, we &s;hall be &s;ure to di&s;cover by what prelate the piece was coined, which is this,&mdash;when the ini|tial of the prelate's name is the fir&s;t letter, &s;uch initial re&s;pects the bi&s;hop's Chri&s;tian name, and con&s;equently when it is &s;et after the D it will be for the bi&s;hop's &s;urname; and this is a general rule. By an indenture dated the 20th of September 1490, this prelate appointed George Stryall, of Durham, gold|&s;mith, to work his mint in that city, from the fea&s;t of St Michael then next for three years, paying four marks yearly to the warden of the Tower of London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The four marks paid to the warden of the Tower was probably a duty for the &s;tamps, which all the charter mints were obliged to pay.&mdash;See Pegge's 'E&s;&s;ay on the Origin of the Metropolitical and other &s;ub|ordinate Mints,' p. 89, 90, 91.</NOTE>, and he with &s;everal others became bound to the bi&s;hop in 300<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> that what mo|ney he coined &s;hould be of the &s;ame alloy, a&s;&s;ay, and weight, as that coined in the Tower of London<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From the clo&s;e rolls in the chancery at Durham, 5 Hen.

On the 7th day of De|cember, 1494, RICHARD FOX was tran&s;lated by the king from the See of Bath and Wells to the bi&s;hopric of Durham; and had the temporalties re&s;tored the next day. He was the &s;on of Thomas Fox, a per&s;on of inferior circum&s;tances, and was born at Rope&s;ly, near
<PB N="372" REF="420">Grantham, in Lincoln&s;hire, about the latter end of the reign of Hen. VI. Was educated at Magdalen college, in Oxford, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for his genius and clo&s;e application; but the plague obliging him to retire from thence, he removed to Pembroke-hall, in Cambridge: Wren, bi&s;hop of Ely, in his ac|count of the ma&s;ters of that college, expre&s;&s;es a doubt, whether he was ever a fellow there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a que&s;tion whether he was ever fellow of the college; for in the letter which the fellows &s;ent to Labourne upon his election, they tell him, there was not a man in England, bred in the college, be&s;ides him|&s;elf, that was worthy of that place.&mdash;Wren's Ma&s;ters of Pembroke Hall.&mdash;Lel. Col. vol. v. p. 389.</NOTE>. When he had &s;taid a competent time in Cambridge, he went for improvement to Paris, where he &s;tudied divinity and the canon law; and whil&s;t there, had the degree of doctor of laws conferred on him. In France he became acquainted with Morton, bi&s;hop of Ely, who fled thither during the u&s;ur|pation of Richard III. by whom, mo&s;t probably, he was introduced to Henry earl of Richmond, who was then meditating a de&s;cent upon England, in order to de|throne the u&s;urper; and, with the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h who were at Paris, he bound him&s;elf by oath to take part with the earl. Richmond accordingly received Dr Fox into &s;ecret &s;amiliarity; and having applied to Charles VIII. king of France, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his enterprize; and being called away, before he could complete his negociation, he left the pro&s;ecution of this important matter to the doctor, whom he thought the fitte&s;t man to manage an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence: Nor was he deceived in him; for he conducted him&s;elf with &s;uch a&s;&s;iduity, atten|tion, and prudence, that he &s;oon obtained men and money from the court of France, and was otherwi&s;e greatly in&s;trumental in Henry's acqui&s;ition of the throne of England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Richardus Fox focius, legum Dr Pari&s;iis, dum res regis Henrici &s;eptimi in Galliis ageret, quem rex &s;ummo favore complexus e&s;t, quia illius &s;olummodo gratia Carolus octavus, Gallorum rex, illum ad huc comitem Richmondiae idque exulantem ad regnum contra Richardum tyrannum repetendum auxiliaribus copijs relevabat.

<P>The &s;tate of Scotland had undergone a new revolution, by the murder of James III. on who&s;e death his &s;on was proclaimed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and crowned by the title of James the Fourth; with whom &s;everal negociations were carried on for repeated truces, which kept the borders free from open inva&s;ion; though from the inte&s;tine troubles of Scotland, frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes, with various &s;ucce&s;s, hap|pened on the marches.</P>

<P>In the year 1494, bi&s;hop Fox, with four others, were commi&s;&s;ioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xii. p. 554, 555.</NOTE> to meet the delegates of the Scotti&s;h king at Cold&s;tream or &s;ome other convenient place, to conclude a la&s;ting peace, or obtain a continuance of the truce, and to fettle the mutual damages occa&s;ioned by violations of the former articles. It does not ap|pear that this negociation was effectual; for in the opening of the year 1495, the king, apprehen&s;ive of an inva&s;ion in &s;upport of the preten&s;ions of the impo&s;tor Warbeck, gave commi&s;&s;ion to thomas earl of Surry<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. $$3.</NOTE>, vice-warden of the We&s;t and middle marches under Henry duke of York, the king's infant &s;on, to array and lead forth all the fighting men between Tweed and Trent.

Some &s;hort time afterwards, the duke of York was con&s;tituted warden-general of all the marches, and on account of his youth had a&s;&s;igned under him vice-wardens, of whom the bi&s;hop of Durham was one. The king of England, in order to &s;ecure as much as po&s;&s;ible the affections and intere&s;ts of the Scotti&s;h court, in this year commi&s;&s;ioned the bi&s;hop of Durham, William earl of Carli&s;le, Thomas earl of Surry, Ralph Neville, lord Neville, Sir Thomas Dacre of Dacre, and Sir William Tyler; and the commi&s;&s;ion was renewed to the &s;ame per&s;ons on the 2d of Septem|ber in the following year, to negociate a marriage between Margaret his daugh|ter and the king of Scotland<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">In each of tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, any two had a power to act, whereof the bi&s;hop of Durham was to be one; and a &s;ecret commi&s;&s;ion was al&s;o given to the Bi&s;hop, &s;i$$ly, of the &s;une date $ith the letter. But they all proved abortive.</NOTE>: But the influence of foreign courts prevailed, and the adventurer was graciou&s;ly received in Scotland; a numerous army was rai&s;ed, which the king commanded in per&s;on; and with a few foreign troops, that Warbeck brought with him, they entered Northumberland. The king of Scotland &s;oon di&s;covered that the attempt would prove fruitle&s;s, as not one Engli&s;hman of con&s;equence joined the army, and they did not receive the lea&s;t hopes of &s;upport from any quarter. This induced the Scots to quit the thoughts of advancing into the country; the army was thrown into divi&s;ions for the &s;ake of pillaging; and after collecting a va&s;t booty, they retired, on receiving intelligence that the Engli&s;h army was approaching.</P>
<P>Parliament, in the following year, granted the king a &s;upply of 120,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to &s;upport the Scotti&s;h war; a much larger &s;um than had ever been granted on a like occa&s;ion. A tax &s;o grievous cau&s;ed much murmuring, and in Cornwall an in&s;ur|rection was the con&s;equence. The king of Scotland took advantage of tho&s;e troubles to enter the borders; with one divi&s;ion of his army he laid &s;iege to Nor|ham, whil&s;t the other laid wa&s;te and ravaged the country. The king in per&s;on conducted the &s;iege, but found a re&s;i&s;tance he did not expect; for the bi&s;hop of Durham had not only garri&s;oned the fortre&s;s with cho&s;en troops, under experi|enced leaders, but al&s;o had thrown into it great &s;tore of provi&s;ion and &s;upplies, and put all the works into complete repair. On hearing that this ca&s;tle was clo&s;ely be&s;ieged, and the attacks carried on with great vigour, the bi&s;hop re&s;orted thither
<PB N="374" REF="422">with a reinforcement for the garri&s;on; and having gained entrance for him&s;elf and party, he conducted the defence in &s;o judicious a manner, that each a&s;&s;ault was re|&s;i&s;ted, and the Scotti&s;h army foiled in every attack; but the outworks of the ca&s;tle &s;uffered much damage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buchannan.&mdash;Holling&s;h. p. 289.</NOTE>. The bi&s;hop had al&s;o put into a po&s;ture of defence every other &s;trong-hold in the country, where he &s;ecured the cattle and valuable effects of the inhabitants, &s;o as to di&s;appoint the marauding parties of their expected booty. The&s;e matters, together with the news of the king of England's &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Wel&s;h in&s;urgents, and the earl of Surry's approach with the northern troops, in|duced the king of Scotland to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and draw off his forces. The earl of Surry &s;oon afterwards entered Scotland, but immediately a negociation for peace took place, and no blow of con&s;equence was &s;truck by the Engli&s;h; for Henry was &s;o intent on his project of a peace and alliance with Scotland, that, at the very in&s;tant his forces were entering Scotland, he gave a commi&s;&s;ion to the bi|&s;hop of Durham and others, to treat with the mini&s;ters of that &s;tate. Peter d'Ayala, a clergyman, envoy from the court of Spain, then in England, was employed by the king as a mediator. He was a per&s;on of acute penetration and excellent parts, had much &s;kill in negociations of this nature, and was of great &s;ervice therein; for, by his conduct and addre&s;s, a truce was obtained for &s;even years, and the bi|&s;hop of Durham was nominated one of the con&s;ervators. In 1499 &s;ome amend|ments were made in the articles of truce, and the bi&s;hop of Durham was al&s;o a con&s;ervator, then named. This treaty was drawn up and &s;igned by the plenipo|tentiaries of the two &s;tates, in Stirling ca&s;tle; and eight days after, on the 20th of July, at the &s;ame place, it was ratified by the king of Scotland. An accident which happened about this time was near de&s;troying what had been effected with &s;o much attention: In the intercour&s;e which immediately took place between the people of both nations, on the borders, &s;ome Scotti&s;h youths came upon a party of plea&s;ure to Norham; the garri&s;on thought they were too &s;peculative, and paid too near at|tention to the works of the ca&s;tle, con&s;idering the recent ho&s;tilities between the &s;tates: The centinels, in a manner offen&s;ive to the Scots, prevented their curio&s;ity, and a fray began, in which &s;ome were &s;lain. Complaint was immediately made to the Engli&s;h wardens, who not granting a &s;atisfactory redre&s;s without delay, the king of Scotland &s;ent his herald to demand the &s;ame of the king, and, on refu&s;al, to denounce war. King Henry returned a gentle an&s;wer, expre&s;&s;ive of his wil|lingne&s;s to grant the redre&s;s required, but at the &s;ame in&s;tant declaring his igno|rance of the matter. the bi&s;hop of Durham wanted not genius to carry his ma&s;|ter's placid purpo&s;es to effect; and taking on him&s;elf the burthen of making the re|quired &s;atisfaction, as the fortre&s;s was his where the offence was given, he exerted him&s;elf to put a &s;top to the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences: He wrote letters to the king of Scotland in &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive and conciliating a &s;tile, that his mind was immedi|ately moved in his favour, and he wi&s;hed to have an interview with one who had &s;uch power to charm his pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ilence his wrath: In this the king had a more exten&s;ive view; for by &s;uch an interview, he hoped a plan might be promoted for the mutual benefit of both kingdoms. Wharton's expre&s;&s;ions on this occa&s;ion
<PB N="375" REF="423">are remarkably &s;trong: "Then king James revealed the &s;ecret of his bo&s;om, his ardent wi&s;h that the prince&s;s Margaret might become his queen." And, &s;peaking of the bi&s;hop's negociation on this important occa&s;ion, he &s;ays, <HI>"Aeternae felicita|tis fundamenta genti no&s;trae po&s;uit."</HI> As &s;oon as the king of Scotland's de&s;ire was made known to the bi&s;hop, he obtained his &s;overeign's permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it Scot|land, and met K. James at Melros-abbey, when a negociation for an alliance was en|tered into; but a di&s;pen&s;ation from the pope being nece&s;&s;ary, on account of the prince&s;s's age and con&s;anguinity of the parties, it was near two years before the treaty was concluded, the bi&s;hop being previou&s;ly tran&s;lated to Winche&s;ter.</P>
<P>William de Chambr&egrave; tells us, this tran&s;lation was occa&s;ioned by a controver&s;y which aro&s;e between the bi&s;hop and the earl of Cumberland, touching their right to the town of Hartlepool; but he is in an error as to the name of the earl, the di&s;pute being with the earl of Northumberland. The ferocious manners of the borderers were not yet corrected; from a habit of warfare they retained the &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition which accu&s;tomed rapine and blood&s;hed confirmed into a brutal &s;tate of mind, a fierce and impetuous temper, which &s;ubmitted not to controul, and knew no other rule than arbitrary will. The influence of the church began to decline, the fetters of &s;uper&s;tition were loo&s;ened, and the terrors of religious judgment re|laxed, &s;o that the minds of men were ha&s;tily returning back to the original fero|city, which was left to &s;ucceeding ages to expel, by learning and an intimate ac|quaintance with arts and &s;ciences, that have civilized what religion left un&s;ubdued.</P>
<P>As to the bi&s;hop's public works in this See, other than as before noted, they were few. He made &s;ome alterations in the great hall of the ca&s;tle: It is de&s;cribed as having two princely &s;eats, one at each end; the lower &s;eat he removed, and converted that &s;pace into offices, making a gallery for mu&s;icians above, where they &s;hould perform during the time of &s;erving up the cour&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Out of a great va&s;t hall in the ca&s;tle there, he took as much away as made a fair buttery and a pantry, even to $$e pulpits or galleries on each &s;ide of the hall, wherein the trumpeters or wind-mu&s;ic u&s;ed to &s;tand to play while the meat was u&s;hered in: And on the wall which parted the &s;aid buttery from the hall, was a great pelican &s;et up, to &s;hew that it was done by him, becau&s;e he gave the pelican to his arms. Bi&s;hop Rei&s;e afterwards took away part of the &s;aid hall at the other end.&mdash;Wood's Athenae Oxon. vol. i. p. 665.</NOTE>: He added a &s;pacious kitchen, with apartments for a &s;teward, and all offices thereto appertaining, to the we&s;t of the hall, at a con&s;iderable expence. In this hall he entertained the prin|ce&s;s Margaret and her retinue, as &s;he advanced into Scotland, on her e&s;pou&s;al with James IV, on the 23d of July, being the anniver&s;ary of his in&s;tallation, when he cau&s;ed to be &s;erved up a high fea&s;t, called, by old writers, <HI>a double-dinner</HI> and <HI>a double-&s;upper:</HI> Perhaps two cour&s;es are what is meant by the expre&s;&s;ion. There were pre&s;ent all the nobility and people of di&s;tinction of the northern parts, as well &s;piritual as temporal. On this occa&s;ion there were, in the train of officers belong|ing to the bi&s;hop, &s;ome never before remarked in any record, viz. "Officers of armes and &s;erjeants of armes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Fian$$lls of the Prince&s;s Marg. written by John Young, Somer&s;et, herald.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop had entered upon a noble de&s;ign, to repair the great tower of the ca&s;tle of Durham, which is capable of being made one of the mo&s;t magnificent erections in the north of England: He began to con&s;truct a hall therein, with a
<PB N="376" REF="424">kitchen and other apartments; but before he advanced far in the plan, he was tran&s;lated from the See. By the excellent ta&s;te this prelate &s;hewed in the few &s;umptuous buildings he made, it is greatly to be lamented he did not carry his in|tention, re&s;pecting the above alterations, into full execution. The tower in its pre&s;ent &s;tate is a mo&s;t noble monument of antiquity, but under bi&s;hop Fox's de|&s;ign would have become an excellent ornament of this ancient city. Godwin &s;ays, he walled in a large park for deer near Durham, but doth not give it a name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Browne Willis &s;ays it was Auckland Park.</NOTE>. In the years 1501 and 1502 he was chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Cambridge.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Fox continued to have great weight and influence in all public affairs during the whole reign of Henry VII. who appointed him one of his executors, and particularly recommended him to his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or Henry VIII. Lord Bacon ob&s;erves, that bi&s;hop Fox was <Q>a wi&s;e man, and one that could &s;ee through &startq;the pre&s;ent to the future:" And he al&s;o &s;ays, "that cardinal Morton and bi|&s;hop Fox were vigilant men and &s;ecret, and &s;uch as kept watch with the king<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Henry VII.</NOTE> almo&s;t upon all men el&s;e: They had both been ver&s;ed in his affairs before he came &endq;to the crown, and were partakers of his adver&s;e fortune.</Q> But upon the acce&s;|&s;ion of Henry VIII. Fox's influence greatly declined at court, though he was in|&s;trumental in promoting the ri&s;e of Wol&s;ey, in oppo&s;ition to the earl of Surry. In 1510, notwith&s;tanding his decline of power, he was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to France, in conjunction with the earl of Surry, and Ruthal then bi&s;hop of Durham, when a treaty of alliance was concluded with Lewis XII. About that time, a &s;harp di&s;|pute aro&s;e between him and archbi&s;hop Warham, concerning the extent of the juri&s;diction of the prerogative court: The argument at length became &s;o violent, that an appeal was made to the pope; but it being referred back to the king, in 1513 he determined it amicably. In the &s;ummer of that year, he attended the king, in his expedition into France, with a large retinue, and was at the taking of Terouenne: In a &s;hort time afterwards, in conjunction with Thomas Gray, mar|quis of Dor&s;et, he concluded a new treaty with the emperor Maximilian again&s;t France. In 1515, being no longer able to bear the repeated mortifications he received from cardinal Wol&s;ey, to who&s;e ri&s;e he had greatly contributed, he with|drew, in deep chagrin, to his own dioce&s;e.</P>
<P>Being highly di&s;plea&s;ed with the fellows of his own college of Pembroke-hall, particularly one Hud&s;on, and de&s;irous of effecting &s;ome great work to the ad|vancement of literature and the benefit of po&s;terity, (great veneration in that age being paid by eccle&s;ia&s;tics to the name and body of Chri&s;t) he was induced, by his intimate friend Oldham, bi&s;hop of Exeter, in the year 1516, to found Corpus Chri&s;ti college in Oxford: Oldham was very rich, and, joining him in the pro|ject, greatly contributed to this foundation. Wren &s;ays, by Oldham's means "he effected his purpo&s;e, and &s;aved much money<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. vol. v. p 204, 390.</NOTE>." This &s;eems rather invidious, and in&s;pires an unfavourable idea of our prelate's character. He had the misfortune to lo&s;e his &s;ight about ten years before his decea&s;e, when he began to conceive an idea of erecting &s;ome religious and public work; and intimated to his friend the
<PB N="377" REF="425">bi&s;hop of Exeter his intention of founding a mona&s;tery. It is &s;aid, Oldham, who had much fore&s;ight and &s;agacity in &s;uch matters, per&s;uaded him to found the col|lege before-mentioned; telling him with a true, prophetic &s;pirit, "that the monks already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much, it was not po&s;&s;ible they could hold it long." This &s;hews, that their enormities were then become flagrant, and their exten&s;ive proper|ties a political grievance, which brought on their di&s;&s;olution in the &s;ucceeding reigns.</P>
<P>In 1522, the bi&s;hop founded a free-&s;chool at Taunton, in Somer&s;et&s;hire, where $e had a fine manor as bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; and there built a convenient hou&s;e for the ma&s;ter. He did the &s;ame at Grantham, near the place of his nativity. He attended parliament in 1523, though he had lo&s;t his &s;ight &s;ome years before. Cardinal Wol&s;ey would have taken advantage of his infirmities, and per&s;uaded him to re&s;ign his bi&s;hopric to him for a pen&s;ion; but the bi&s;hop re&s;i&s;ted all his in&s;inuations and wiles; and by the me&s;&s;enger who was entru&s;ted to conduct his in|&s;idious projects, he returned the cardinal a me&s;&s;age to this purpo&s;e, "That though by rea&s;on of his blindne&s;s he was not able to di&s;tingui&s;h black from white, yet he could di&s;cern between true and fal&s;e, right and wrong, and plainly di&s;|covered, without eyes, the malice of an ungrateful man: That it behoved the cardinal to take care, not to be &s;o blinded with ambition, as not to fore&s;ee his own end: He need not trouble him&s;elf with the bi&s;hopric of Winche&s;ter, but ra|ther &s;hould mind the king's affairs."</P>
<P>In the year 1518, the bi&s;hop re&s;igned the ma&s;ter&s;hip of Pembroke-hall. He built an elegant chapel at Winche&s;ter; at which place he died, in the year 1528; and was interred in his own chapel, his e&s;&s;igies in marble being placed upon his tomb<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This monument is a mo&s;t fini&s;hed &s;pecimen of the improved Gothic; there is no in&s;cription to his me|mory, but he is repre&s;ented by the effigles of a &s;keleton.

This is the fir&s;t time we have the name of the city &s;o &s;pelt, and the general way we find it upon the money of the &s;ucceeding bi&s;hops. Upon the arms of the chair on the obver&s;e, and the extremity of the upright of the cro&s;s, are mitres, though imperfectly repre&s;ented; on the &s;ides of the &s;hield, near the bottom, are the letters R. D. for <HI>Ricardus Dunelmen&s;is.</HI>&mdash;N^o 2. is the rever&s;e of a penny of this bi&s;hop; it reads CIVITAS DIRHAM, with a ro&s;e
<PB N="379" REF="427">after the fir&s;t word, and a mitre upon the top of the upright of the cro&s;s, as the la&s;t, but this more di&s;tinct; and the &s;ame letters R. D. as on the preceding coin.&mdash;N^o 3. is al&s;o the rever&s;e of another penny of his; the legend is CIVI|TAS D.RHAM: This coin is peculiar in having the mitre much larger than the others, upon the rever&s;e; and in&s;tead of being placed upon the upright of the cro&s;s, it is &s;et upon the &s;hield, and the upper part of the upright is wanting. None of the above have any mint-mark.&mdash;It may be thought not a little extraordinary, that we &s;hould have &s;everal &s;pecimens of this bi&s;hop's mo|ney coined in the year 1502 (which was that of the re-coinage) and none before, either of his or of his predece&s;&s;or's in this reign. However, the above pennies were certainly &s;truck in this year, in which this prelate was al&s;o tran&s;lated to Winche&s;ter, and the type of them will not let us &s;uppo&s;e they were coined before: This may be accounted for, from the great quantity of money that mu&s;t have been coined at this time, both in the royal and charter mints, to &s;up|ply the place of that &s;ent in to be re-coined; and as the penny was the mo&s;t cur|rent &s;ort then u&s;ed (and con&s;equently would be the mo&s;t worn and defaced) it may be the rea&s;on why the pennies &s;truck in this reign, before the 18th year, &endq;have entirely di&s;appeared.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;hort character is given of our bi&s;hop; that he was a man of con&s;iderable political abilities, and appears to have been more of the artful &s;tate&s;man, than of the Chri&s;tian prelate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><FIGURE>

<P>The reader is now entering upon the mo&s;t momentous period of our epi&s;copal hi&s;tory, and approaching to a di&s;play of tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in the annals of our palatinate as well as country at large, who brought about the greate&s;t event in Briti&s;h hi&s;tory. In order to advance with due attention, the reader will recollect, that this palatinate was an eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate in the mo&s;t enlarged &s;en&s;e of the term; it was the only one in Britain; &s;ingular and unparal|leled in this kingdom; governed by a potentate, in whom was united the prince and prelate, the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction; and though &s;ubject to the con|&s;titutional laws of the empire at large, yet was governed by a viceroy holding a court of barons and privy council; and by a provincial, cu&s;tomary, or common law, and provincial officers of ju&s;tice of every rank; an imperial mitre, and a popedom in miniature; holding the reins of civil government, and having an un|limited authority over eccle&s;ia&s;tics and church affairs, without the controul and vi&s;itation of a metropolitan. Viewing our bi&s;hopric in this light, it may be nece&s;|&s;ary to collect a general &s;tate of religious manners at this period, that we may be provided with due e&s;timates and ideas, previous to our advancing to the material events of this reign.</P>
<P>The principles of Wycliffe and the reformers had made a &s;low progre&s;s, having been oppo&s;ed with violent per&s;ecutions, and not by controver&s;y and confutation: The church held abundant power, and the legi&s;lative authority nodded in fetters: The religion of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics was di&s;&s;olved into &s;hew and pageantry, piety and ener|gy were forgotten, and the religion of the people was made up of &s;uper&s;tition and practical &s;ervices: The holine&s;s of the mind, the religion of rea&s;on and of the &s;oul, were buried with the fathers of the Saxon church: Pilgrimages, and the adoration of per&s;onages uncomprehended in the Trinity, veneration for &s;aints' relics and holy rags, were the rage of the times: The care of the clergy was confined to the mainte|nance of that grandeur and power, to which they had been rapidly advancing for two preceding centuries; and to that end they were for ever bu&s;ied in extending their pri|vileges, and protecting their rights from infringement and innovation: Di&s;cipline was neglected, and learning gone to decay: The clergy regarded their &s;piritual power and juri&s;diction, only as the means of protecting their temporal rights from viola|tion: The authority of the church was become the chief object with the religious: The papal power was increa&s;ed to an enormous height; and though England held re&s;trictive &s;tatutes for repre&s;&s;ing all uncon&s;titutional exten&s;ion of juri&s;diction here, yet they were left to &s;leep in oblivion; whil&s;t innovations, like a flood, pa&s;&s;ed over the dormant powers: There was not a bi&s;hopric in England at this period that did not pa&s;s by Rome's provi&s;ional bull; nor a temporal matter of moment to the &s;tate, but what was dignified by her &s;anction. There is no occa&s;ion to go into a review of the more &s;candalous practices; let them &s;leep with the baleful ages in which they prevailed; it is enough to a&s;&s;ert, that the exten&s;ion of papal power was incompatible with the foundations of liberty our ance&s;tors had provided. The corruptions which had crept into our own clergy are the proper &s;ubjects for our animadver&s;ions. The age was vicious and immoral: Luxury and all her train of contagious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the people: Pride, magnificence, and outward pomp, had contaminated every rank of men: Public &s;pectacles and expen&s;ive enter|tainments
<PB N="387" REF="435">were the occupations of every mind. In the beginning of Hen. VIII. 's reign,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, Hale, &amp;c.</NOTE> he yielded him&s;elf wholly to the vices of the age, and all the propen|&s;ities of his youth: Every day he held tournaments, balls, concerts, fea&s;tings, and other expen&s;ive diver&s;ions; till, in a very &s;hort time, he had totally di&s;&s;ipa|ted the immen&s;e &s;um of 180,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> with which his father's coffers were filled by every kind of extortion. The clergy were participators of the&s;e enormities; and cardinal Wol&s;ey is charged with an ingenious invention towards &s;uch di&s;&s;ipa|tions, in which he &s;tudied to have his &s;overeign immer&s;ed, that he might gain in|fluence by cheri&s;hing his vices, and endear him&s;elf to his king by being the nur&s;e of tho&s;e very &s;ins he ought to have repre&s;&s;ed. Mo&s;t of the bi&s;hops were promoted to their Sees for having rendered them&s;elves &s;erviceable to Rome, or to the depra|ved pa&s;&s;ions of their &s;overeign; they were named from per&s;ons brought up at court, and trained in the maxims there practi&s;ed: Real learning was &s;carce heard of in this aera: The canon law and &s;chool divinity were the accompli&s;hments every &s;tudent &s;ought promotion by: The monks had filled the colleges, and occupied the profe&s;&s;or&s;hips of the univer&s;ities; by which means, philo&s;ophy and divinity were thrown a&s;ide, for a &s;y&s;tem of logical jargon which might furni&s;h the di&s;|putant with the art of wre&s;ting an argument. Every one &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity there was of reforming the church, and bringing the corrupted eccle&s;ia&s;tics from their vices; but no potentate dared to make the attempt: The See of Rome it&s;elf &s;hewed a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the nece&s;&s;ity, but trembled to its foundation at the mea|&s;ures to effect it. It is wonderful to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s by which Providence brings about the greate&s;t events; involuntary agents are frequently the operators of divine will, and often the wicked hand of the determined &s;poiler brings about a ble&s;&s;ing he could not comprehend: Thus the ravages of war have made a pa&s;|&s;age for the progre&s;s of arts; and the &s;word, embrued in blood, and extended by the hand of cruelty, hath led on the olives of religion and virtue, introduced the polity of di&s;tant &s;tates to dark and ignorant nations, and civilized the barbarity of the mo&s;t &s;avage people of the earth. The power of the church was grown enor|mous, and the drones of religious &s;ocieties had engro&s;&s;ed a va&s;t territory in this kingdom; in&s;omuch, that the civil juri&s;diction was &s;traitened, the &s;tate enfeebled, and a dreadful anarchy appeared to be approaching, which would in a &s;hort time have &s;wallowed up the Engli&s;h monarchy. The churchmen, had many of them been virtuous, might have &s;tayed the &s;lood of donations, which were ince&s;&s;antly pouring in upon them from &s;uper&s;titious hands and terrified con&s;ciences; they might have corrected the vices of their hou&s;es, and the impieties of their breth|ren. But the character given of them by John Hu&s;s and Jerome of Prague, at the hour of their condemnation, was too true: <Q>That the church of Rome, and &startq;all the other churches in the world, were far &s;werved from the apo&s;tolical tra|ditions: That the clergy ran after plea&s;ures and riches: That they lorded it over the people, affected the highe&s;t feats at entertainments, and bred hor&s;es and dogs: That the revenues of the church, which belonged to the poor members of Chri&s;t, were con&s;umed in vanity and wantonne&s;s: That the prie&s;ts

<P>In all the public tran&s;actions, of which our prelate had a part, or the palatinate was particularly intere&s;ted, a &s;econd character &s;eems &s;o interwoven, that it appears impo&s;&s;ible, with any degree of per&s;picuity, and without running into dull repeti|tions in the progre&s;s of this work, to avoid carrying on an account of both per&s;ons, in the &s;eries of events to be related: This was Thomas Wol&s;ey, the cotemporary and colleague of our prelate in &s;tate matters, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the bi&s;hopric.</P>
<P>Wol&s;ey's birth and education are &s;o well known, and the early events of his life have been di&s;played by &s;o many writers, that the repetition here would not be pardoned. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was a very great advocate with Henry VIII. for Wol&s;ey; he ob&s;erved his active and penetrating mind, and hoped to le&s;&s;en the intere&s;t of lord Surry, whom he hated, by encrea&s;ing the king's favour to this young and a&s;piring mini&s;ter. The king made Wol&s;ey his almoner<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"As fa&s;t as the other coun&s;ellors coun&s;elled the king to leave his plea&s;ures and to attend to his a&s;&s;ai$$, &s;o bu&s;ily did the almoner per&s;wade him to the contrary, which delighted him much, and cau&s;ed him to $$ve the greater affection and love for the almoner. Thus the almoner $uled all them that before ruled $word$; $word$ did his policy and wit bring to pa&s;s."&mdash;Cavendi&s;h's MSS. in the Harleim Collection.</NOTE>; and &s;oon afterwards pre&s;ented him with the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of Emp&s;on, one of Henry VII.'s rapacious officers, who was convicted of high trea&s;on. In 1510, Wol&s;ey was admitted a member of the privy council, and reporter of the proceedings in the &s;tar-chamber; and from thenceforth his promotions were rapid. He acquired a competent know|ledge of his &s;overeign's di&s;po&s;ition of mind, and the bent of his favourite pa&s;&s;ions, and thence derived his influence. He &s;tudied to indulge his love of ea&s;e, and at|tachment to plea&s;ures; &s;ought every occa&s;ion to withdraw him from public bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="390" REF="438">and to leave matters of &s;tate to the conduct of his mini&s;ters. He had a luxuriant imagination, and a genius calculated for gay exhibitions and expen&s;ive diver&s;ions: This faculty he exerted to immer&s;e the king in voluptuous enjoyment, and &s;pared no expence in the gratification of his &s;overeign's love of &s;plendor and plea&s;ure. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter could not help murmuring, to &s;ee the trea&s;ures lavi&s;hed away in idle &s;ports and di&s;&s;ipations, which his old ma&s;ter, Henry VII, had ama&s;&s;ed with &s;o much care, pains, and inju&s;tice; "in which he him&s;elf had been employ|ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE>." He charged the trea&s;urer, lord Surry, as the chief cau&s;e: But as the whole court were gaining favours from the vices of the king, the bi&s;hop's pious clamours were de&s;pi&s;ed; in a little time he retired in deep chagrin, under a decline of influ|ence which he daily ob&s;erved, and which brought him at length into contempt.</P>
<P>Wol&s;ey, it is &s;aid, was a principle agent in in&s;tigating the king of England to engage in a war with France, in the year 1513; in the negociation of which mat|ter with the pope, archbi&s;hop Bainbrigg was envoy at Rome. The motives which induced Wol&s;ey to advi&s;e the war, and the events, are well known.</P>
<P>The king of England was no &s;ooner on the continent, to pro&s;ecute the war there, than a herald was &s;ent from Scotland to complain of injuries &s;u&s;tained from brea|ches of truce by the borderers, coupled with a&s;&s;urances that the &s;tates were re&s;olved to &s;upport their ally the king of France, in con&s;equence of the &s;everal treaties &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between the nations. This me&s;&s;age was received by Henry when he lay be|fore Tourenne, and the an&s;wer he gave, in the warmth of re&s;entment and youthful ra&s;hne&s;s, was &s;o full of contemptuous and har&s;h expre&s;&s;ions, that the herald, on his return, refu&s;ed to repeat them. The tenor of this an&s;wer was, an accu&s;ation again&s;t the Scotti&s;h king, <Q>of a breach of &s;olemn oaths, a crime his progenitors were &startq;charged with having been addicted to. He was upbraided with di&s;honourably taking advantage of Henry's ab&s;ence; but as the fragility of his faith, and the whole tenor of his pa&s;t conduct, had given too much ground for &s;u&s;picion, he a&s;&s;ured him precautions were taken, before the Engli&s;h army embarked, for the defence of England; and as he had &s;hewn a &s;oul &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;o little genero|&s;ity and princely truth, he would exclude him and his de&s;cendents from any po&s;|&s;ibility of &s;ucceeding to the crown of England, though he had been informed &endq;he had fixed an ambitious eye on that elevated dignity.</Q> It is evident this wrathful an&s;wer, &s;o full of reproaches, did not influence the conduct of the king of Scotland, for, previous to the herald's arrival, the Scotti&s;h army had entered England, and their king had lo&s;t his life at the &s;atal battle of Flodden-field.</P>
<P>A &s;mall body of troops, under the command of lord Hume, had entered England, and ravaged and laid wa&s;te the borders. The main body of the Scotti&s;h army, led by the king in per&s;on, followed by flow marches. Lord Surry, who was collecting the forces of the northern counties with all po&s;&s;ible diligence, &s;ent forward Sir William Bulmer with a troop of archers of this palatinate, who called to his aid the people of the Engli&s;h march, not exceeding in the whole one thou&s;and men, formed an ambu&s;cade in the deep broom which grew in &s;ome parts of M$$field plain, near the road the Scotti&s;h marauders mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s with their &s;poils,
<PB N="391" REF="439">and there put them to the rout. The Scotti&s;h leaders made &s;everal efforts to rally, and lead up their troops in order, but were not able to &s;u&s;tain the regular and heavy di&s;charge of the archery: They left five hundred &s;lain upon the field, and as many more were taken; lord Hume lo&s;t his &s;tandard, and his brother George was among the pri&s;oners. The king of Scotland, eager to revenge this di&s;grace, proceeded with more &s;peedy marches, and entered England on the 22d day of Augu&s;t 1513, at the head of an army of 60,000 men. The &s;iege of Norham opened his military operations; the outworks were forced, one of the towers was beat down, and many of the garri&s;on were &s;lain at the fir&s;t attack, &s;o vigorou&s;ly was the fortre&s;s a&s;&s;ailed. The main tower held out for &s;ix days, and then capitulated; on which occa&s;ion the greate&s;t part of the works were de&s;troyed. The reduction of the ca&s;tles of Etal, Wark, and Ford, followed. The king of Scotland did not pur&s;ue his advan|tages, and march forward whil&s;t the panic of his approach prevailed, but, fa&s;cinated by the lady of Ford ca&s;tle, he loitered till the earl of Surry had collected his army, and was approaching him; which drew on the battle of Flodden-field, &s;o fatal to the king and his people, on the 9th day of September. In the challenge &s;ent by the earl of Surry to the Scotti&s;h king, from the camp of Wooler-Haugh, are the names of three di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons of this palatinate, William Conyers, John Lumley, and Sir William Bulmer; and in the fir&s;t line formed for that me|morable battle, was Sir William Bulmer, with the forces of the bi&s;hopric of Dur|ham. No mention is made of their numbers; but, from their &s;tation in the array, it is more than probable they won &s;ome of the chief honours of the day; for the earls of Lenox and Argyle making a fierce attack with their troops, armed with long pikes, on the right wing commanded by the lord-admiral, earl Surry's &s;on, the con|flict was de&s;perate, and the event long dubious, till a reinforcement &s;trengthened that part of the line, and gave the advantage to the Engli&s;h. Soon after that change of fortune, the Engli&s;h arms prevailed in every part of the field. It is probable all the forces of the palatinate were out upon this &s;ervice; for when lord Surry marched his army northward through Durham, St Cuthbert's banner was di&s;played with the u&s;ual ceremonies, which, as ob&s;erved before, being the royal &s;tandard of the province, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be attended by all the military men of the palati|nate. Another circum&s;tance in &s;upport of this opinion is, that the &s;tandards taken from the Scots in that engagement were placed as trophies round St Cuthbert's feretory. Letters were written in the name of the king, after his return from France, to all per&s;ons of note who had &s;ought in his army at Flodden, extolling their gallant behaviour, and a&s;&s;uring them of his royal favour, whenever an op|portunity &s;hould offer for their promotion.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Scotland was thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;u&s;ion by the fatal event, the heir to the crown being an infant of only &s;even months old; but as the di&s;&s;entions touching the regency did not a&s;&s;ect this province, and there was no further warfare on the borders, it is time to return to bi&s;hop Ruthall and his col|league.</P>
<P>Wol&s;ey returned to England with the king, in October 1513, after a new treaty was entered into with the emperor, and on the 26th of March following was con|&s;ecrated
<PB N="392" REF="440">bi&s;hop of Lincoln; advancing daily in the king's favour, till at length he engro&s;&s;ed the &s;ole admini&s;tration of &s;tate affairs. Cardinal Bainbrigg pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t hours of his life in great di&s;plea&s;ure with Wol&s;ey and the court, frequently re|proaching the mini&s;ter with want of gratitude: On his death, Wol&s;ey was promo|ted to the See of York. He immediately began to repair York-place, the hou&s;e of the archbi&s;hops in London, and to erect a &s;umptuous palace at Hampton-court. Overtures of peace being made by France, Wol&s;ey alone was entru&s;ted with the negociation, and it is &s;aid enriched his coffers on the occa&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guthrie, vol. ii. p. 889.</NOTE>, the terms and conce&s;&s;ions he granted being purcha&s;ed by France with great gifts. Whil&s;t he ma|naged the whole of this treaty and other public matters with an arbitrary hand, he had &s;uch power of per&s;ua&s;ion and artful demeanor, and had &s;o entire a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the king's mind, that he made him believe every thing was done in pur&s;uance of his royal command.</P>
<P>The king of France &s;oon afterwards departed this life without i&s;&s;ue, and was &s;ucceeded by the duke of Valois, who a&s;&s;umed the title of Francis the Fir&s;t. He entered Italy in a &s;hort time after his acce&s;&s;ion, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the duchy of Milan. This event was &s;eized on by Wol&s;ey to en&s;lame his &s;overeign's mind again&s;t him, for the French king had done him ill offices with the pope touching the bi&s;hopric of Tournay; but he made peace with the mini&s;ter, by en|gaging his intere&s;t to obtain him the vacant cardinal's hat, which was then become the chief object of his ambition. Wol&s;ey had employed cardinal Adrian bi&s;hop of Bath, and the pope's collector in England, to &s;olicit that honour for him at the court of Rome, but di&s;covered he had betrayed his cau&s;e; whereupon he prevailed upon the king to write to the pope, to &s;olicit that he might be deprived of his office, and on &s;ome pretext obtained his deputy Polydore Virgil's impri&s;onment in the Tower, he having been privy to &s;ome repre&s;entations which were unfavourable to him. The application for the hat, in Wol&s;ey's favour, met with great oppo&s;ition; but at length the intere&s;t of the Engli&s;h &s;overeign prevailed, he was decreed the purple, and on the 7th of September 1515 was created cardinal of St Cecile be|yond the Tiber.</P>
<P>When the cardinal was informed his hat was come into England, he ordered a me&s;&s;enger to be di&s;patched, to &s;tay the bearer on the road till he &s;hould be better attended. He prepared a mo&s;t magnificent retinue; and the bearer of this valua|able gift was met on Blackheath by a great a&s;&s;embly of prelates, and men of figure and con&s;equence from the county of Kent, who conducted him with a pompous parade through the city of London to We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, the lord-mayor, alder|men, and re&s;pective companies of the city of London, attending in their &s;tands during the proce&s;&s;ion. At We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, eight abbots in their proper habits received the &s;acred hat with great &s;olemnity, and placed it on the high altar, where, after this pious farce, it re&s;ted till the 18th of November, being Sunday, when Wol&s;ey repaired to the abbey, accompanied by the principal nobility and people of con&s;equence about the court and its vicinity, and kneeling before the altar with his hood over his face, whil&s;t the prayers and benedictions adapted to
<PB N="393" REF="441">the creation of a cardinal were read to him, he was inve&s;ted by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who, with much religious grimace, put the hat on his head. This ceremony being ended, the cardinal returned to his palace at Charing-Cro&s;s, at|tended by a va&s;t concour&s;e of people, where a &s;umptuous entertainment was provi|ded, at which were pre&s;ent the king and queen, the queen of Scotland, the queen dowager of France, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the bi&s;hops of Worce&s;ter, Dur|ham, and Roche&s;ter, the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, Sir John Fineux lord chief ju&s;tice of England, the other judges, &s;erjeants at law, and a multitude of others of high di&s;tinction. Rapin &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 731.</NOTE>, <Q>Wol&s;ey &s;o ab&s;olutely governed the king, that he &startq;turned him which way he plea&s;ed; but he managed &s;o artfully, that the king always fancied he took his own cour&s;e, when he only followed the &s;ugge&s;tions of his mini&s;ter. Wol&s;ey had great talents, but he had al&s;o great failings; he was exce&s;&s;ively revengeful, greedy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and honours, and intolerably proud. He no &s;ooner &s;aw him&s;elf fixed in his ma&s;ter's favour, than he &s;ought means to remove from court all tho&s;e that gave him any jealou&s;y by the king's e&s;teem for them: The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, who had been mo&s;t in favour, received &s;o many mortifications from this imperi|ous &endq;prelate, that at length they quitted the court, not to be expo&s;ed to his in|&s;ults.</Q> Fox withdrew to his dioce&s;e, having fir&s;t be&s;ought humbly of the king, that he "would not &s;uffer the &s;ervant to be greater than the ma&s;ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>."

On archbi&s;hop Warham's re&s;ignation of the &s;eals, Wol&s;ey was appointed chancellor.

The vulgar only were fa&s;cinated by his parade, others &s;aw it with cen&s;ure and contempt. He was condemned by all good men, who looked upon his magni|ficence as a &s;candal to his religious character, and regarded the tin&s;el decorations of his life as the di&s;graceful badges of his corruptions. By&s;ield, who was after|wards a martyr, exclaimed, <Q>My lord cardinal is no perfect or good man; Chri&s;t &startq;never taught him to follow riches, nor to &s;eek promotions; Chri&s;t never taught &endq;him to wear &s;hoes of &s;ilver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Mem. vol. i. p. 120, 121.</NOTE>,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the year 1516 the cardinal received a commi&s;&s;ion from the pope, appointing him legate a latere; on receipt of which he made a new parade and proce&s;&s;ion, to the di&s;grace of religious ceremony: He affected to perform the offices of high-ma&s;s after the manner of the pope him&s;elf, and not in the accu&s;tomed mode of other bi&s;hops; in which he was &s;erved by bi&s;hops and abbots, and the fir&s;t nobility were employed to deliver him the water and towel. To &s;upport the expences of his hou&s;ehold, be&s;ides the profits of his chancellor&s;hip, the revenues of his bi&s;hoprics, and other valuable re&s;ources, he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, at very low lea&s;es, of the revenues of Bath, Worce&s;ter, and Hereford, bi&s;hoprics filled by Italians, who were allowed to re&s;ide abroad, and were glad to compound for this indulgence by parting with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of their profits. He had al&s;o about this time a pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and livres granted by Charles king of Spain, having before obtained the con|ditional grant of a pen&s;ion of ten thou&s;and ducats out of the duchy of Milan; and it was computed, that the whole of his revenues, with the pen&s;ions and numerous pre&s;ents received from abroad, annually exceeded the revenues of the crown. But though he engro&s;&s;ed &s;uch a prodigious income from eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil appoint|ments, yet, Anthony Wood &s;ays, "he was the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted clergyman of that age." In the mid&s;t of all this magnificence, the cardinal's re&s;entments broke out into vengeance, and even the lea&s;t affronts were remembered with &s;everity, as in the ca&s;e of Sir Amias Powlet, who had offended him in the early part of his life.</P>
<PB N="395" REF="443">
<P>In con&s;equence of Wol&s;ey's legatine authority, he erected an inqui&s;itorial court, in which he exerci&s;ed an undue authority and power, not known before in England, and totally uncon&s;titutional, wherein he examined into matters under a kind of rule of con&s;cience, as well civil as religious.</P>
<P>The cardinal now a&s;&s;umed the power of pre&s;enting to all priories and benefices, as he plea&s;ed, with all the u&s;urped latitude exerci&s;ed by the pope, without regard|ing the right of patronage or election, to which the nobility or eccle&s;ia&s;tical bodies were entitled.</P>
<P>He accompanied the queen to Oxford, where they were received with every public mark of honour and di&s;tinction. On this occa&s;ion, he informed the univer|&s;ity of his de&s;ign of founding public lectures on theology, civil law, phy&s;ic, philo|&s;ophy, mathematics, the Greek language, and rhetoric, which he performed in a &s;hort time afterwards; but e&s;tabli&s;hing no fund for their future maintenance, they &s;unk with him: He was al&s;o in&s;trumental in e&s;tabli&s;hing the college of phy&s;icians. Had not his vanity prevailed in all things, the&s;e works would have preponderated again&s;t many of his errors: He was the means of di&s;&s;uading the king from enter|ing into a league with the pope again&s;t the Turks, which he repre&s;ented as a &s;tale expecient to draw contributions from the clergy: He got the legate, who had a vi&s;itorial power, &s;uper&s;eded and recalled; and obtained the pope's bull for vi&s;iting the mona&s;teries and clergy.</P>
<P>On the election of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the emperor Maximilian, who died in the year 1519, France and Spain, having various cau&s;es of contention and rival&s;hip, were equally de&s;irous of bringing over the king of England to favour their re&s;pective intere&s;ts; for which purpo&s;e, they both cultivated, with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, the friend&s;hip of Wol&s;ey: Be&s;ides pre&s;ents and pen&s;ions, they vied with each other who &s;hould care&s;s him mo&s;t; &s;tiling him in their letters their friend, their patron, and their father; and extolling to the &s;kies his virtue, prudence, and capacity. Wol&s;ey artfully made u&s;e of tho&s;e te&s;timonies to flatter his &s;overeign's vanity, by repre&s;enting to him how formidable he mu&s;t be to tho&s;e two potentates, when they thus earne&s;tly &s;olicited the aid and friend&s;hip of his &s;ervant; at the &s;ame time the king conceived Wol&s;ey's abilities mu&s;t be greatly &s;uperior to tho&s;e of all other mini&s;ters, when they were thus acknowledged by the greate&s;t princes in Europe.</P>
<P>On the French king's treaty for the &s;urrender of Tournay, much incen&s;e was of|fered to the cardinal's vanity, who&s;e weakne&s;s in that part was known to all the neighbouring potentates; and he obtained a pen&s;ion of 12,000 livres, in &s;atisfac|tion of the lo&s;s of his bi&s;hopric. On the above occa&s;ion, it was &s;tipulated, that there &s;hould be an interview between the two monarchs, near Ardres, in Picardy; and Wol&s;ey, as a man of infinite ta&s;te and magnificence in public &s;hews and pro|ce&s;&s;ions, was fixed upon between the &s;overeigns to regulate the ceremonies, as ma&s;ter of the revels. Previous to Henry's departure in this interview, he receiv|ed a vi&s;it from the new-elected emperor, the king of Spain; the cardinal was &s;ent to compliment him on his arrival, and conducted him to the king at Canter|bury. During the emperor's &s;tay in England, he paid great court to Wol&s;ey; and knowing his weakne&s;s and intolerable vanity, he engaged him in his intere&s;t,
<PB N="396" REF="444">by &s;ome vi&s;ionary promi&s;es of procuring the papacy. The &s;ame day on which the emperor left England, the king &s;ailed from Dover, attended by queen Catharine, the queen dowager of France, Wol&s;ey, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the dukes of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Buckingham, the marquis of Dor&s;et, and many other noblemen and prelates, and gentry of both &s;exes, to the number of four thou&s;and per&s;ons and upwards. The interview, on the 7th of June, in the valley of Ar|dres, was uncommonly magnificent; the whole &s;olemnity being regulated by Wol&s;ey: On the 11th the tournaments began, &s;caffolds being erected for the &s;pectators; both kings entered the li&s;ts, and exhibited great dexterity; but the honour of the field was won by the king of England: This exhibition ended, there were &s;plendid fea&s;ts, balls, and ma&s;querades; and &s;uch pomp and magnifi|cence was di&s;played, that the place obtained the name of <HI>Le Camp de Drap d'Or,</HI> or The Field of Cloth of Gold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Antiquarian Society have publi&s;hed two mo&s;t elegant prints of the Embarkation and Interview, from ancient paintings in Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle, with hi&s;torical de&s;criptions of each print by John Topham, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> and Sir Jo&s;eph Aylo&s;&s;e, bart.&mdash;See the Archaeologia, publi&s;hed by the &s;ociety, vol iii. p. 185, and vol. vi. p. 179.

About this time the pope granted Wol|&s;ey a pen&s;ion of 2000 ducats out of the bi&s;hopric of Placentia, and con&s;tituted him perpetual admini&s;trator of the See of Bajadox. This year an account was taken, by Wol&s;ey's order, of the number of pari&s;hes in England, when there appeared to be 9407 churches.</P>
<P>In the year 1521, at an a&s;&s;embly of the prelates and clergy at the cardinal's palace, the doctrines of Luther were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and &s;olemnly condemned; and the pope's bull again&s;t tho&s;e religious tenets was publi&s;hed: By proclamation, all the books touching this condemned here&s;y were ordered to be brought in, under pain of excommunication. Bi&s;hop Burnet &s;eizes this matter, to &s;upport his former ar|guments, and prove, that Wol&s;ey was afraid of the approaching reformation; and, to retard its progre&s;s, per&s;ecuted the &s;ectaries: But it was a&s;&s;uredly other|wi&s;e; for his &s;tate and magnificence depended &s;o much on the approbation of the See of Rome, that he oppo&s;ed whatever was in oppo&s;ition to that See, not from principle, but intere&s;t. Bi&s;hop Burnet &s;ays, <Q>All people were &s;o &s;en&s;ible at &startq;this time of the corruptions, that each motion towards a reformation was readily hearkened to every where. Corruption was the common &s;ubject of complaint; and in the commi&s;&s;ion given to tho&s;e whom the king &s;ent to re|pre&s;ent him&s;elf and his church, in the council of the Lateran, the reformation of the head and members is mentioned, as that which was expected from that &endq;council.</Q></P>
<P>This year afforded another in&s;tance of Wol&s;ey's thir&s;t of revenge, in the im|peachment and death of the duke of Buckingham, who was an enemy to his un|bounded pride and arrogance<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Godwin't Annals of Henry VIII. p. 46, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The cardinal's leading features are &s;een in the tran&s;actions touching the king of England's mediation between the king of France
<PB N="397" REF="445">and the emperor; wherein he &s;tipulated, that the king of England and him&s;elf &s;hould be con&s;ervators of the &s;everal articles of the treaty he had propounded. Upon this part of the treaty, Rapin makes the following remark: <Q>We have here &startq;a very &s;en&s;ible proof of the cardinal's in&s;olence, who, in a treaty drawn by him|&s;elf, pre&s;umed thus to &s;et him&s;elf on a level with his ma&s;ter, by being declared &endq;con&s;ervator with the king.</Q>&mdash;But as to the great engagements the cardinal en|tered into, they prove him to be without knowledge of the con&s;titution, without any love of his country, and without truth to maintain the principles of hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>On Wol&s;ey's return, he obtained the rich abbey of St Alban's <HI>in commendam;</HI> and al&s;o a bull to prolong his legatine authority for two years more, and to em|power him to create fifty knights; an equal number of counts palatine, acolites, and chaplains, and forty apo&s;tolical notaries; to legitimate ba&s;tards, and grant the doctors degree in all the faculties, as well as di&s;pen&s;ations of every cla&s;s. The pope &s;oon afterwards departed this life, and cardinal Adrian Florentius was elected; the emperor di&s;po&s;ing of his intere&s;t again&s;t Wol&s;ey, contrary to his engagements: This di&s;appointment Wol&s;ey met without any apparent chagrin, though the venom of re&s;entment rankled &s;ecretly in his bo&s;om. A rupture &s;ucceeding in a &s;hort time between England and France, the emperor, de&s;irous of maintaining his footing with king Henry, on the 26th of May, 1522, vi&s;ited England, and was received by the cardinal with a magnificent retinue: On Whit&s;unday the cardinal cele|brated high-ma&s;s at St Paul's, with all the pomp of a &s;overeign pontiff; dukes and others of the nobility of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction holding water to him, the king and emperor being pre&s;ent. On this vi&s;it, the emperor granted letters patent to Wol|&s;ey for a pen&s;ion of 9000 crowns of gold; and, among&s;t other terms by which he endeavoured to conciliate and &s;ecure his future friend&s;hip, renewed his promi&s;es of intere&s;t for the papacy on the next vacancy.</P>
<P>In order to &s;upport the war which England had ru&s;hed into, the king, by the advice of his mini&s;ters, i&s;&s;ued warrants to all &s;heriffs and con&s;tables, to number the people from the age of &s;ixteen upwards, and &s;pecify the effects of individuals, that he might borrow a tenth of the laity, and a fourth of the clergy. Rapin &s;ays, <Q>&startq;This made a great noi&s;e all over the kingdom, and every one openly exclaimed again&s;t the cardinal as the author: However, though at fir&s;t he had given orders to exact loans with the &s;ame rigour as if they had been a tax impo&s;ed by parliament, he met with &s;o many ob&s;tacles, that he was apprehen&s;ive of rai&s;ing commotions in the kingdom, not to be appea&s;ed at his plea&s;ure; &s;o that the tax &endq;was levied much more gently than at fir&s;t intended.</Q></P>
<P>About this period, and perhaps on the preceding occa&s;ion, the king command|ed the bi&s;hop of Durham to deliver him a &s;tate of the kingdom in general, but particularly of tho&s;e matters which more e&s;pecially related to the crown: He was e&s;teemed a per&s;on well qualified for &s;uch a calculation, had been long in office, and knew the particular revenues of the king, and the &s;ources from whence they were derived: By &s;uch knowledge, he was enabled to make a calculation of the income and revenues of the counties at large, and the re&s;pective manors therein, with the &s;everal fees and &s;ervices wherewith each was charged: and could point
<PB N="398" REF="446">out from whence re&s;ources in time of nece&s;&s;ity might be derived. It is probable, the enormity of church po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions was never &s;o manife&s;tly demon&s;trated as in this work, or perhaps never before &s;truck the eye of a &s;overeign with &s;o powerful an image. The reader will no doubt wonder that our prelate &s;o long retained his in|fluence at court: Wol&s;ey could bear no competitor: To be of a judicious capacity, was offence &s;ufficient to incur his di&s;like, and move him to projects for his avoid|ance. It is evident from the &s;equel, that the cardinal at this time entertained no good-will towards bi&s;hop Ruthall, but wi&s;hed to be rid of him; for it is related, that our prelate obeyed the king's command, compo&s;ed the account required in a fair hand, and bound it up in vellum. As he was thus employed at the king's in|&s;tance to &s;tate the condition of the revenues of the kingdom, he thought of look|ing into the &s;tate of his own fortune, and got a &s;econd volume, bound in the &s;ame manner with the former; wherein he in&s;erted an exact inventory of all his effects, both real and per&s;onal, not le&s;s in value than one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling. The king &s;ent to the bi&s;hop for the royal e&s;timate, which his maje&s;ty was very impatient to &s;ee; but, by a fatal mi&s;take, that containing the inventory of his own e&s;tates was delivered, in&s;tead of that compo&s;ed by the king's order. Car|dinal Wol&s;ey in&s;tantly di&s;covered the error, but neverthele&s;s carried the book to the king, and told his maje&s;ty, with &s;ome &s;arca&s;tical &s;everity, that though he would not meet with the account he expected in that volume, yet he would know where to apply for money when he wanted. It does not appear the king took any advan|tage of this di&s;covery; but when the bi&s;hop was informed of the error, his di&s;ap|pointment and grief overpowered him; he was &s;eized with a mortal di&s;ea&s;e, and departed this life in London, on the 4th day of February 1522. Upon this inci|dent the following remark occurs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Jortin.</NOTE>: <Q>Whil&s;t we dete&s;t the treachery of the car|dinal, &startq;we cannot afford much pity to the bi&s;hop with his hundred thou&s;and pounds. If he had made a wi&s;e u&s;e of them, like archbi&s;hop Warham, who had the honour and the glory to live and ie poor, they would have been beyond &endq;the reach of the king and cardinal:</Q></P>
<Q><L><HI>"Extra fortunam e&s;t quicquid donatur amicis</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Quas dederis &s;olas &s;emper habebis opes.</HI></L></Q>
<P>"&startq;&endq;Even a pagan could &s;ay this."&mdash;It is evident, from the &s;um our prelate ama&s;|&s;ed, that he had &s;hared with the harpies of the times. The cardinal was the figuring character, the o&s;ten&s;ible per&s;on in all public matters; whil&s;t the old fox, with much cunning, had concealed him&s;elf under the cover of Wol&s;ey's authority, and reaped a &s;hare of the plunder and &s;poils, without partaking of the odium of the world.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Ruthall was interred in St John's chapel, We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, with his effigy and this epitaph on his monument: <HI>Hic jacet Tho. Rowthall Epi&s;copus Dunelm. et Regis Hen. VII.

<P>The cardinal's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities before noted at one time, is an unparalleled in&s;tance, an enormity that mu&s;t have in&s;pired every ob&s;erver with condemnation.</P>
<PB N="402" REF="451">
<P>On the pope's death, our cardinal's ambition was again di&s;appointed, Clement the Seventh being elected. He was now convinced of the emperor's in&s;incerity, and &s;aw, that he had been playing on his pa&s;&s;ions, but covered his re&s;entment with a &s;mile. In con&s;equence of congratulations to the pope elect, he obtained, in 1524, a grant of the legatine power for life, a thing unprecedented.</P>
<P>At this time the king of England was charged with &s;uffering his wardens and officers on the borders to aid the rebels and outlaws of Scotland, <Q>inciting them &startq;to the contempt of their &s;overeign lord's authority; riding with convocations of thieves, traitors, and murderers, their accomplices, &s;o many as they might be, and as far within the land as they dur&s;t, robbing, &s;poiling, and overthrowing &endq;the true lieges of the realm at their power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 515.</NOTE></Q> The lord Dacres, warden of the we&s;t march, had entered Scotland with a plundering party, who committed great enormities, having de&s;troyed Kel&s;oe, with eighty villages, and overthrown eighteen towers of &s;tone, with all their works: Add to the&s;e, that the king of England had ordered all the Scots in his dominions to be impri&s;oned, and their effects &s;eized, after which they were ordered to be branded with a cro&s;s, and &s;ent home<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hall.</NOTE>. Not|with&s;tanding all the&s;e outrages, and great preparations for war being made by both nations, nothing effectual was done on either &s;ide; a treaty was &s;et on foot for a pacification, but broke up without bringing matters to a conclu&s;ion, and the &s;pring of the year 1523 was again bu&s;y with movements, on the part of England, to carry on a war under the conduct of the earl of Surry. The marquis of Dor&s;et was ap|pointed warden of the ea&s;t and middle march, with Sir William Bulmer his lieu|tenant for the ea&s;t, and Sir William Eures for the middle march. The Scots laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle of Wark, but were not able to take it; and the Engli&s;h army contented them&s;elves with defending the borders, without carrying their arms into the enemy's country. Several &s;hort truces took place, and a treaty of peace for three years was at length concluded on the 10th of March 1526: In the com|mi&s;&s;ion for this negociation, Sir William Bulmer is one.</P>
<P>In 1525 the cardinal was employed in taking mea&s;ures, which, though of little note in them&s;elves, were big with example, and led to future events of the mo&s;t momentous con&s;equence. He laid the fir&s;t &s;tone of a magnificent &s;tructure at Oxford, which he de&s;igned &s;hould bear the name of Cardinal College: In order to carry on this co&s;tly undertaking, he did not open his overburthened co&s;&s;ers, or withdraw any thing from his luxuries and the expence of his magnificence, but procured the di&s;&s;olution of the priory of St Fride&s;wide at Oxford, which being &s;urrendered into the king's hands, his maje&s;ty immediately granted the &s;ame to the cardinal for the purpo&s;es of this erection, and he obtained a bull from the pope to confirm what was done. It is not &s;aid that this di&s;&s;olution took place in con&s;e|quence of the cardinal's vi&s;itorial authority, from any vices or irregularities com|mitted there by the members of the priory, or for any other religious cau&s;e, but appears to have been effected merely to &s;upply this exigence. Wol&s;ey was an ad|venturous &s;inancier, but not &s;trenuous in the cau&s;e of religion, otherwi&s;e than in maintaining the authority of the See of Rome: This example might be a political
<PB N="403" REF="452">trial, what effect would ari&s;e thereby, and how &s;imilar acts would be received. The king had &s;tudied divinity, and was a di&s;putant on tenets of religion with Lu|ther, having written a book of controver&s;y, for the merit of which the pope and holy college granted him the di&s;tingui&s;hed title of <HI>Defender of the Faith.</HI> It &s;eems from thence, that at the out&s;et the king was a &s;trenuous maintainer of the church. On various exigencies ari&s;ing not only in the &s;tate, but by unbounded expences in diver&s;ions, fea&s;ting, gamings, and public &s;hews, &s;ome extraordinary method was to be devi&s;ed to rai&s;e &s;upplies. Thus many writers have argued; and from thence deduced a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the di&s;&s;olution of religious hou&s;es was the con&s;equence; the effect of the king's vices, and not of any regard to the &s;tate, or the correction and reformation of the church. But be it as it will, the cardinal &s;eems to have been merely an involuntary agent, directed from narrow purpo&s;es and views, to lead on the momentous event. Having &s;ucceeded in the fir&s;t attempt, he now ventured to procure the di&s;&s;olution of &s;everal &s;mall mona&s;teries, &s;ituated in diffe|rent parts of England, in order to apply the revenues to the maintenance of his new foundation. The alarm occa&s;ioned by this throughout the kingdom was great, and though reformation was the language of multitudes, though politicians of judg|ment &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity there was to check the growth of religious foundations, and the doctrines of Luther &s;ecretly gained ground with tho&s;e men who gave their minds a turn to think deeply, and withdrew them&s;elves from the luxurious enjoyments which had crept into public manners. Yet Wol&s;ey's attack was not received with any countenance; on the contrary, the popular clamours reached the king's ear, and the tumult &s;urrounded him whenever he appeared in public. His maje&s;ty on this occa&s;ion wrote a letter to the cardinal full of reprehen&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 67.&mdash; Rapin, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and Wol&s;ey, to regain the king's favour, and remove any di&s;advantageous impre&s;&s;ions, made him a pre&s;ent of his magnificent palace at Hampton-Court, and took an opportunity of acquainting him with the tenor of his will, in which he had bequeathed to him all his riches.</P>
<P>In a &s;ucceeding treaty made with France, it appears the cardinal &s;ecretly exer|ci&s;ed his re&s;entment again&s;t the emperor, by the terms then entered into by Eng|land. &mdash;In 1526, the king granted a power to the cardinal, to alter the value of the current coin of the kingdom; and he erected two provincial mints, one at York, and another at Durham; but of this hereafter.&mdash;In 1527, the king made &s;everal earne&s;t applications to be divorced from queen Catharine. He was become enamoured of Anne Boleyn, one of the queen's maids of honour, who was at that time addre&s;&s;ed by lord Percy, &s;on to the earl of Northumberland, then in Wol&s;ey's hou&s;ehold, to whom &s;he was much attached: But to &s;erve the king's humour, Wol&s;ey u&s;ed his influence to break off the connection; and then laid the foundation in her heart, by the bitterne&s;s of di&s;appointed love, for the hatred &s;he entertained for the cardinal, which in the end wrought his ruin. In the &s;um|mer of this year, Wol&s;ey was appointed amba&s;&s;ador to France: His chief attend|ants were, Dr Tun&s;tall, then bi&s;hop of London; the earl of Derby; lord Sands; Dr John Taylor, ma&s;ter of the rolls; Sir Tho. More, and Garter king of arms; with a &s;plendid train of knights, gentlemen, and attendants, to the number of
<PB N="404" REF="453">twelve hundred. Cavendi&s;h gives an account of the order of his cavalcade. When Wol&s;ey arrived at Calais, he delivered the great &s;eal into the cu&s;tody of the ma&s;ter of the rolls, till his return to that city. Cavendi&s;h gives a full account of the interview and negociation, in which a treaty of amity was concluded. The third article in this treaty tended to encrea&s;e Wol&s;ey's pride and power; the pope was then a pri&s;oner to the prince of Orange, an ally of the emperor, and it was thereby &s;tipulated, that the powers of England and France &s;hould never con&s;ent to the convocation of a general council during his holine&s;s's captivity, and that they would receive no bull, brief, or mandate from him, until he regained his liber|ty; but in the mean time every thing &s;hould be punctually executed in England, which was determined by the cardinal legate with the concurrence of the clergy. It is &s;aid, Wol&s;ey made attempts to get his legatine power extended to France and Germany, but did not &s;ucceed. On the above emba&s;&s;y, he received great pre&s;ents both from the king of France and his mother, arrived in England on the 30th of September, and was graciou&s;ly received by the king, who ordered a public thank&s;|giving for the &s;ucce&s;s of his negociation. Collier &s;ays, <Q>And here the lord Her|bert &startq;ob&s;erves, the king's fancy began, of being head of the church and clergy; and that the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of this kind were received from the cardinal; of whom, likewi&s;e, this noble hi&s;torian reports, the king took the hint for the di&s;|&s;olution &endq;of mona&s;teries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 23.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<PB N="408" REF="457">in the year 1526 i&s;&s;ued his commi&s;&s;ions, with the king's in&s;tructions annexed, for arraying &s;hips in the ports of the county palatine, to attend and &s;erve under the king's admiral in the north &s;eas.</P>
<P>In the 14th and 15th years of Henry VIII, (1522 and 1523) an act of parlia|ment was made touching the coinage, intitled, <Q>An act what coiners &s;hall do that &startq;&endq;make money at any mint within England;</Q> whereby it was provided, that no|thing therein contained &s;hould affect the coiners of York, Dure&s;me, or Canterbury.
<PB N="409" REF="458">As to our prelate's mintage in this province, Mr Noble &s;ays, <Q>As primate of &startq;York and bi&s;hop of Durham, his mints &s;upplied great part of the north of the kingdom with money, the coin being now numerous. He coined groats and half-groats at York, but only pennies at Durham, and they mu&s;t be cla&s;&s;ed in &endq;two divi&s;ions, tho&s;e &s;truck before, and tho&s;e after the 18th year of his reign.</Q> He gives three &s;pecimens of Wol&s;ey's coin minted at Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See place of coinage letters N. N. N. N^o 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> <Q>N^o 1. The &startq;epigraphe upon the obver&s;e is, HENRIC. DI GRA. REX ANGL.; between the words there are &s;mall cro&s;&s;es, as the obver&s;es of his money generally have; upon the rever&s;e the legend reads, CIVITAS DVRRAM; and the letters D. W. upon the &s;ides of the &s;hield, above the bars of the cro&s;s, mu&s;t be read Dunelmen|&s;is Wol&s;ey<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As he and his predece&s;&s;or were of the &s;ame Chri&s;tian name, he might not chu&s;e to put the initial of his fir&s;t name upon his money of Durham, except there was al&s;o that of W. for Wol&s;ey; this is a pretty &s;trong proof that tho&s;e with the letters T. D. upon them have been properly placed to Ruthall.</NOTE>.&mdash;N^o 2. is the rever&s;e of a penny of his; it reads CIVITAS $$R|RAM, and has al&s;o the initials D. W. but has not the cardinal's hat: $$th this and N^o 1. have a &s;tar for the mint-mark, the former on both &s;ides; from which circum&s;tance, it is probable this penny was al&s;o coined before the 18th
<PB N="410" REF="459">year of this reign. In the year 1527, when the &s;econd coinage of this reign took place, the king gave the cardinal a commi&s;&s;ion re&s;pecting the equalling his coins to tho&s;e of the neighbouring mints, or the royal money in general. This no doubt re&s;pected his mints both at York and Durham; and probably enjoined him to copy the type of the new money, to prevent frauds, by having more than one kind of money in the kingdom.&mdash;N^o 3. is a penny after the type of the king's &s;econd coinage; the epigraphe on the obver&s;e is, H. D. G. ROSA SIE SPIAE, they however generally read SPIA; the legend upon the rever&s;e is, Cl|VITAS DVRIIAM, with the initials T. W. &s;et as the letters upon N^o 1. and 2. are and at the bottom of the &s;hield is the cardinal's hat. The mint-mark is a &endq;$$$ent.</Q> The coins of the &s;econd coinage are much &s;carcer than tho&s;e of the fir&s;$ the rea&s;on is, that he re&s;igned this bi&s;hopric in little more than a year after the &s;econd coinage of Henry VIII. took place.</P>
<P>The future public tran&s;actions of the cardinal being in no-wi&s;e pertinent to our provincial hi&s;tory, we mu&s;t quit the &s;ubject of his life at this period, and wind up with his general character.</P>
<P>He is de&s;cribed to be in per&s;on tall, comely, and very graceful in his carriage and air: It is &s;aid one eye was blemi&s;hed by a certain di&s;ea&s;e, which occa&s;ioned his pictures to be always taken in profile; but this &s;eems to be a low, &s;candalous, and puerile conjecture, and without &s;upport. He was a man of quick parts, a clear and ready perception, and of great indu&s;try; but every good quality was over&s;ha|dowed by the poi&s;on of ambition, and the arrogance of pride. He advanced him|&s;elf, by an exertion of extraordinary abilities and a pro&s;titution of every principle, to &s;erve his king and aggrandi&s;e his own fortune. He governed England for the &s;pace of twenty years, during which time he knew all the cabals of foreign courts, and had &s;pies on every prince in Europe, by which he rendered him&s;elf truly formidable, having in his hands the exerci&s;e of all his &s;overeign's power, &s;o that he was courted, flattered, bribed, and care&s;&s;ed, by the greate&s;t potentates in Chri&s;ten|dom. He rendered England formidable to all the powers of Europe during his admini&s;tration, by his intrepidity, his ab&s;olute power, and determinate will. Yet his negociations were not conducted by political principles or patriotic virtue, but arbitrary maxims, and felfi&s;h, lucrative views. Mr Hume &s;ays, <Q>If in foreign &startq;politics he &s;ometimes employed his influence over the king, for his private pur|po&s;es, rather than his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, which he boa&s;ted he had &s;olely at heart, we mu&s;t remember, that he had in view the papal throne, a dignity which had he obtained, would have enabled him to make Henry a &s;uitable return for all &endq;his favours.</Q> The latter part of Henry's reign has been held up in compari&s;on with the former, wherein Wol&s;ey pre&s;ided, and the errors of one in competition with the other, given in argument for his admini&s;tration: But this is a vi&s;ionary ju&s;tification; for the enormities of the latter part of the king's life were perhaps born of the feeds which Wol&s;ey had &s;own, and the principles he did not live to &s;ee matured in life.

On many of the mo&s;t important occa&s;ions, he di&s;played his contempt of the laws, and utter di&s;regard to the con&s;titution of his country, when they lay in competition with his own power, intere&s;t, or ambition. He was charged with great immoralities and a la&s;ci|vious life; and yet, in public, he kept up much &s;hew of &s;olemnity, piety in re|ligious offices, and the exterior forms of religion; had an eloquent and per&s;ua&s;ive tongue, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;uperior &s;hare of learning and true ta&s;te; he promoted and gave great &s;upport to literature, and was the general patron of learned $$$n.

<P>The king having e&s;tabli&s;hed this great point, had no longer any dread of papal interpo&s;ition, to controvert his purpo&s;e in the divorce, and interfere with his government of eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters; and therefore granted a general pardon, in ample form, to all the clergy.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e affairs were agitated with much warmth, the &s;tate of the borders was turbulent, and mutual inroads were made. Le&s;ley &s;ays, the king perceiving the jeopardy of the northern parts of his dominions, by &s;uch con&s;tant irruptions of the Scots, the Engli&s;h border being thinly inhabited, propo&s;ed to his parliament, that a pole-tax &s;hould be impo&s;ed, to enable government to rai&s;e bulwarks, or a chain of fortre&s;&s;es, to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e incur&s;ions; but the mea&s;ure was oppo&s;ed. It ap|pears that the Scots &s;urpri&s;ed the ca&s;tle of Norham; but it was &s;oon retaken by Frankeleyne, then archdeacon of Durham, and who had been temporal chancellor there in cardinal Wolfey's time, and during the vacancy of the See after his tran&s;|lation: For this &s;ervice, he had an armorial coat granted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">F.

<P>In the year 1532, an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed for extingui&s;hing the payments of annates or fir&s;t-fruits of bi&s;hoprics to the See of Rome, which had drained from England, &s;ince the &s;econd year of Henry VII.'s reign, no le&s;s a &s;um than 160,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and a provi&s;ion was made, touching the con&s;ecration of prelates, by the authority of the king.

<PB N="416" REF="465">This event added new force to Henry's de&s;ire of &s;haking off the power of Rome; as the queen, re&s;enting the pope's non-compliance, cea&s;ed not to irritate and urge his pa&s;&s;ions on that pur&s;uit; and when the pope, through the in&s;tigation of the emperor, publi&s;hed a &s;entence again&s;t the king, it brought to a cri&s;is that de&s;ired bu&s;ine&s;s, and England was for ever &s;evered from the See of Rome; for the whole legi&s;lative body was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with the pontiff's conduct, that with one mind they determined utterly to aboli&s;h the papal authority in England. A &s;tatute was made, whereby it was enacted, <Q>That, for the future, the pope &s;hall have nothing &startq;to do in the nominating or pre&s;enting of bi&s;hops; but that when a bi&s;hopric &s;hall become vacant, the king &s;hall &s;end to the chapter a <HI>Cong&egrave; d' Elire;</HI> and in ca&s;e the election &s;hall not be over in twelve days after the licence i&s;&s;ues, the election &s;hall belong to the king.

The people in general rejoiced, and tho&s;e favouring the reformation flattered them&s;elves the new principles of re|ligion would gain a rapid progre&s;s: But the propitious aera was not yet arrived, a multitude of ob&s;tructions ari&s;ing; for the king, to clear him&s;elf from the impu|tation of turning prote&s;tant, which was bruited with much rancour, exerci&s;ed great rigour again&s;t the Lutherans, and brought multitudes of the &s;acramentarians to the &s;take: The monks, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e &s;acrifices, were imprudent enough to exclaim publicly again&s;t the legi&s;lative mea&s;ures, which ha&s;tened the more tardy &s;teps of their de&s;truction, by exciting the king's indignation.</P>
<P>After the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion act was pa&s;&s;ed, our prelate was one of the king's me&s;&s;engers to queen Catharine, then at Bryden. They attempted to per&s;uade her to relin|qui&s;h her title, and &s;ubmit to the &s;entence; but all their learned arguments could not prevail again&s;t her ob&s;tinate virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 175.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The parliament which met on the third of November, 1534, confirmed the king's title of <HI>Supreme Head of the Church of England.</HI> By another act, the bene|fit of &s;anctuary was taken away from per&s;ons accu&s;ed of trea&s;on: And by a third, annates and fir&s;t-fruits were given to the king, together with tenths of all eccle&s;i|a&s;tical benefices. In 1535, our bi&s;hop was one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for taking the valuation of eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, in order to &s;ettle the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths under the before-mentioned act. By another &s;tatute, provi&s;ion was made for &s;uffragan bi&s;hops, which revived an in&s;titution of the primitive church, that had been di&s;continued for &s;everal centuries.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity there was of the king's maintaining his mea&s;ures again&s;t the See of Rome, combating with his aver&s;ion for the name of here&s;y, he having in his heart entertained no idea of reformed principles in religion, like a &s;torm, to&s;&s;ed
<PB N="417" REF="466">him in different directions: His &s;teps were rigorous; he per&s;ecuted the Lutherans with unremitting &s;everity, at the in&s;tant he was pur&s;uing his projects to overcome by force the ob&s;tinacy of &s;uch of his &s;ubjects as refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the laws late|ly enacted; in con&s;equence of which, the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter and Sir Thomas More &s;uffered death on the &s;caffold, and &s;everal other eccle&s;ia&s;tics were brought to execution. As Henry had conducted him&s;elf for &s;ome time with great haughti|ne&s;s, <Q>he found, if he relaxed on this occa&s;ion, it would certainly be a&s;cribed &startq;either to his &s;cruples or to a &s;en&s;e of his weakne&s;s, than which nothing could be more prejudicial to him; this con&s;ideration, joined to his &s;tern and haughty temper, rendered him altogether untractable: From thenceforward he became fierce, cruel, in&s;en&s;ible of his people's calamities, and executing without mercy the laws dictated by him&s;elf to his parliament. All that can be alledged in his vindication is, that he was often provoked by per&s;ons, who, endeavouring to alienate the hearts of his &s;ubjects, attacked him in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part, be|cau&s;e &endq;his whole reliance was upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rapin.</NOTE>.</Q> The monks, by every &s;ecret influence and artifice, endeavoured to incen&s;e the minds of men again&s;t the king; they &s;till held many in the bondage of &s;uper&s;tition and religious horror, and practi&s;ed on &s;uch &s;ubjects to &s;tir up &s;edition. To prevent the mi&s;|chief which evidently threatened, Henry re&s;olved to try how his &s;ubjects in gene|ral would be affected under the idea of a di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;teries; and for that purpo&s;e made a movement in a lower degree: The <HI>ob&s;ervant friars</HI> had been mo&s;t clamorous again&s;t the mea&s;ures of &s;tate, and he made them the fir&s;t objects of his wrath; he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed their fraternities, and filled their hou&s;es with Augu&s;|tines<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. $$9.</NOTE>. It is a&s;toni&s;hing with what re&s;ignation the king's purpo&s;es were &s;ubmitted to; various rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned by learned writers; and it is the mo&s;t ge|neral opinion, that the morals of the religious at that period greatly contributed to influence the acquie&s;cence of the people; one party dreading re&s;i&s;tance, as de|&s;tructive to their e&s;tabli&s;hment; the other watching for favourable circum&s;tances to advance their de&s;igns. The fate of the <HI>ob&s;ervant friars</HI> occa&s;ioning no ad|ditional clamour, and being determined effectually to &s;ap the power of Rome in his dominions, Henry &s;aw no way to accompli&s;h it, but by &s;tripping the religious hou&s;es of their influence and authority. He had proved, that there was no cer|tain means of dividing the monks from the papal authority, and thence he was led to pur&s;ue the de&s;truction of the mona&s;teries with every degree of &s;everity and attention. An act of parliament was pa&s;&s;ed, to empower the king to vi&s;it, order, and reform all errors and abu&s;es in religion; under which he did not doubt to remove the people's ancient prejudices and affections for the monks, by a public di&s;covery of their errors and enormities, and thereby pave the way to his great de|&s;ign. He had views beyond the renunciation of the authority of Rome, the profits he &s;hould derive from a confi&s;cation of mona&s;tic po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by which he might &s;upport the approaching war threatened by the emperor, without impo&s;ing any tax on his &s;ubjects: The benefit and advancement of religion was the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;entiment of his heart. To traver&s;e the progre&s;s of this great bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="418" REF="467">through all its &s;tages would lead us beyond our limits. We &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to de&s;cend to &s;ome particulars, when the hi&s;tory of the cathedral church of Durham, and &s;ome of the inferior mona&s;teries are treated of. Therefore, it mu&s;t &s;uffice in this place to &s;ay, that an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed (27 Hen.

<P>The county of Durham was greatly affected by the above act, though the cathedral church &s;tood undi&s;&s;olved. It will appear remarkable to the reader, that the vices and enormities charged on the le&s;&s;er mona&s;teries were not to be di&s;cover|ed in the large: But there was a grand fine&s;&s;e in this<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pa$$$r.</NOTE>; for the act tells us, "Tho&s;e were regular, and an&s;wered the purpo&s;es of their in&s;titution." Perhaps the le&s;&s;er hou&s;es could not be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed without the con&s;ent of the greater, and of tho&s;e there were no le&s;s than twenty-&s;ix mitred barons, who &s;at in the hou&s;e of lords: It was prudent, therefore, to lay the apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e abbots a&s;leep, and prevent their &s;u&s;picion of &s;alling under the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>There happened a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the affairs of the mona&s;teries in the king's mind for &s;ome time, his heart being occupied by two di&s;cordant pa&s;&s;ions, under which he was grievou&s;ly agitated; the one, his jealou&s;y of queen Anne; the other, a violent love for Jane Seymour, one of the maids of honour: The fir&s;t brought on the un|timely fate of the queen, and the latter elevated the favourite to the throne. To render this flagrant act more atrocious, the king got his marriage with queen Anne annulled, and a &s;entence of divorce was pronounced on the &s;urmi&s;e of a previous contract, by which the prince&s;s Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. By an act made in the &s;ucceeding parliament, the divorce was confirmed, and the i&s;&s;ue of both the king's marriages di&s;abled from inheriting the crown: But power was ve&s;ted in his maje&s;ty to declare the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by letters patent, or his will. Rapin &s;ays, <Q>&startq;Had the &s;entence of divorce been pa&s;&s;ed before the trial, &s;he could not have been condemned for adultery, &s;ince her marriage with the king mu&s;t have been con&s;i|dered only as a concubinage: But Henry had acquired &s;uch an ab&s;olute &s;way over his &s;ubjects, that his will was the &s;ole mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice and law; nay, he &s;o little regarded the public and his own reputation, that he married Jane Sey|mour &endq;the day after Anne Boleyn's death.</Q> And, &s;peaking of the above act of parliament, he adds, <Q>This is a clear evidence, that the parliament had not ju&s;tice &startq;&endq;and equity &s;o much in view, as plea&s;ing the king.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1356, the king cau&s;ed to be exhibited, Articles of Alterations in re|ligious Doctrines, and orders to examine them, and make report thereof to his maje&s;ty. The reformi&s;ts on this appeared in high &s;pirits, and openly &s;eparated
<PB N="419" REF="468">them&s;elves from tho&s;e who were adherents to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; of the latter, it is &s;aid, were bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall, and Lee archbi&s;hop of York<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide articles at length, Collier, vol. ii. p. 122.</NOTE>: Yet in the copy of articles in the Cotton library, both tho&s;e bi&s;hops are &s;ub&s;cribers thereto. To this in&s;trument there are the hands of eighteen bi&s;hops, forty abbots and priors; and, of the lower hou&s;e of convocation, four deans of cathedrals, twenty-five archdea|cons, three deans of collegiate churches, &s;eventeen proctors, and one ma&s;ter of a college. Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall being a &s;ub&s;criber, &s;hews his great moderation in religi|ous matters, though he &s;tands in the li&s;t of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the reformation. In con&s;equence of the articles, Cromwell, privy &s;eal, i&s;&s;ued injunctions to the clergy grounded thereon: The fourth declares, <Q>That they &s;hould not lay out their rhe|toric &startq;in &s;louri&s;hing upon images, relics, or miracles, upon any motion of &s;uper|&s;tition, or covetou&s;ne&s;s; that they ought not to per&s;uade their people to pilgri|mages, contrary to the intendment of the late articles, but rather exhort them &endq;to &s;erve God, and make provi&s;ion for their families:</Q> And the &s;eventh pro|vides, <Q>That every church &s;hould have a bible in Latin and Engli&s;h, to be laid in &startq;&endq;the choir, for every one to read at their plea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P>The king, to appea&s;e the minds of the people, who now appeared to declaim again&s;t his mea&s;ures, re-founded &s;ome religious hou&s;es, on &s;tricter rules; but that not prevailing, an in&s;urrection was &s;ormed in the north, headed by &s;everal of the di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed clergy, who a&s;&s;embled under the title of <HI>The pilgrimage of grace,</HI> carry|ing &s;everal religious en&s;igns, with crucifixes, and other holy things, u&s;ually exhi|bited in proce&s;&s;ions. The people of Richmond&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire, We&s;tmoreland, Cumberland, and Durham, fired the beacons, a &s;ignal for all men capable of bear|ing arms to a&s;&s;emble, and put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence, which gave a great alarm to government. The earl of Shrew&s;bury was ordered to march im|mediately with a body of troops, to quell the in&s;urgents. As the rebels moved forward, they rein&s;tated the monks in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their mona&s;teries, and the monks in return u&s;ed every effort to en&s;lame the minds of the populace, with that enthu&s;ia&s;tic rage &s;uper&s;tition and bigotry in&s;pire. To intimidate &s;uch monks as were thus repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of their old &s;eats, under the influence of the in|&s;urgents, the king ordered an example of terror to be exhibited, by dragging out the religious from &s;everal mona&s;teries thus &s;eized, and executing them by martial law: Among tho&s;e hou&s;es, where this tragedy was exhibited, we &s;ind Norton and Hexham are named. The rebels advanced as far as Donca&s;ter, in the month of October, where they were met and amu&s;ed, by the duke of Norfolk, with the pro|po&s;als of a treaty, and petition to the king for redre&s;s of grievances, projected merely to give time for the royal army to advance, which Henry propo&s;ed to lead in per&s;on. Sir Ralph Elerker and Robert Bowes pre&s;ented the potition to the king, to which he &s;ent an an&s;wer in certain articles penned by him&s;elf, and granted a pardon to all, except &s;ix per&s;ons therein named, and four unnamed. The nor|thern clergy met at Pontefract, and agreed to certain articles of religion, to be pro|po&s;ed at the treaty: The archbi&s;hop of York was pre&s;ent at this a&s;&s;embly, when he told the people, that be their grievances what they might, the manner of their ap|pearance
<PB N="420" REF="469">was unwarrantable, and an armed pilgrimage was totally unlawful. After this meeting, a day was appointed to treat with the duke of Norfolk, and other the king's commi&s;&s;ioners. At the head of the in&s;urgents, we find John lord Scroop, the lord Latimer, John lord Lumley, Thomas lord Darcy, Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Ro|bert Con&s;table, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Stephen Hamilton, Sir Thomas Hilton, Rich|ard Tempe&s;t, and William Lumley, with many other di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons of this country. The demand of the malcontents was extravagant, incon&s;i&s;tent, and inad|mi&s;&s;ible; one of which was, <Q>That the liberties of the church &s;hould have old &startq;cu&s;toms, as the county palatine of Durham, Beverley, Ripon, St Peter of York, &endq;and &s;uch other, by act of parliament.</Q> The king told the people, in an&s;wer to their petition, "that they were brutes, and inexpert folks." It is ob&s;ervable, that this &s;entence, with &s;ome other parts, were interlined by the prince him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speed's Hi&s;t. Great Britain.</NOTE>. To amu&s;e the populace, a general pardon was granted, which had the de&s;ired effect of di&s;uniting the in&s;urgents, who returned in &s;mall parties to their re&s;pective coun|ties. The duke of Norfolk &s;till kept his troops together, and at their head, exact|ed oaths of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the country as he pa&s;&s;ed: But the popular di&s;&s;atisfac|tion did not &s;ub&s;ide; the di&s;appointed monks &s;till retained an influence over the con&s;ciences of the vulgar, and &s;ome &s;mall parties took the field again, though they were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed, and the lord Darcy, Sir Robert Con&s;table, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Stephen Hamilton, Nicholas Tempe&s;t, and William Lumley, in con&s;equence of this latter offence, were apprehended for high trea&s;on, and car|ried up to London, where lord Darcy was beheaded; &s;everal eccle&s;ia&s;tics and others were al&s;o executed at Hull, York, and el&s;ewhere in the north, among whom were &s;ix abbots, the prior of Bridlington, five Lincoln&s;hire prie&s;ts, and &s;everal monks. The duke of Norfolk di&s;charged his commi&s;&s;ion with great rigour, and di&s;patched no &s;mall numbers by martial law. The king being at length moved to clo&s;e the tragedy and &s;top the i&s;&s;ue of blood, granted another general pardon.</P>
<P>It is evident, from the names of the active per&s;ons in the rebellion, that this province had a great &s;hare therein; and the con&s;equence was, that material change which immediately took place here, when the honours and ancient authorities of the palatinate were taken away; when this bi&s;hopric was deprived of tho&s;e powers wi&s;e and pious princes had placed here, not only for the honour of the province, but al&s;o from the mo&s;t prudential political principles and maxims of &s;tate. The regal diadem of Deira was never torn from hence till this aera. The franchi&s;es and <HI>jura regalia</HI> were retained, after the di&s;&s;olution of the heptarchial &s;tates, and union of the provinces; but the ruthle&s;s tyrant, with the hand of de&s;truction and arbitrary will, came forth, and &s;wept away in vengeance all the ancient glory of this imperial mitre, and levelled its greate&s;t honours with the earth. How our prelate was affected in mind by this &s;troke, is not &s;aid; he had been di&s;ciplined into pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and probably looked upon the &s;olemn ruin with a &s;ilent &s;igh. An act of parliament was pa&s;&s;ed in the 27th year of this reign; by the fir&s;t clau&s;e of which, the bi&s;hop was deprived of the privilege of pardoning any of the offenders in the late tumults, by being re&s;trained from granting any future pardons
<PB N="421" REF="470">within his palatinate to principals or acce&s;&s;aries in trea&s;ons, murders, man&s;laugh|ters, felonies, or any outlawries for &s;uch offences; by the &s;econd clau&s;e, the an|cient authority of appointing and commi&s;&s;ioning ju&s;tices was taken from the bi|&s;hop; by the third, all writs were directed to run in the name of the king, the bi&s;hop having only the right of te&s;ting the proce&s;s in his name; by the fourth, the ancient tenor of indictments was taken away, and the offence was thereafter directed to be &s;tiled <HI>again&s;t the peace of the king,</HI> and no longer <HI>again&s;t the peace of the bi&s;hop,</HI> as was the u&s;ual form; by the fifth, the king was to take all manner of fines, i&s;&s;ues, amerciaments, and forfeitures of &s;tewards, bailiffs, or other mini&s;ters or officers of franchi&s;es or liberties, for non-execution, mi&s;-execution, or in&s;ufficient returns of &s;uch writs, warrants, precepts, or other proce&s;s, which to them or any of them, or to any their deputy or deputies &s;hould be directed, or for any con|tempt or other mi&s;demeanor, what&s;oever it be, concerning their offices, in and for the due execution or admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, any grant, or allowance, or other thing to the contrary thereof notwith&s;tanding; and that the amerciaments for in|&s;ufficient returns of writs, or other proce&s;s made by &s;tewards or bailiffs of liberties or franchi&s;es, having returns of writs and execution of the &s;ame, &s;hould be put and &s;et upon the heads of &s;uch &s;twards or bailiffs, and not upon the &s;heriffs: The ninth, tenth, and eleventh, relate to the purveyors of the king's court; the four|teenth and fifteenth enact, that all &s;heriffs and their officers within &s;uch liberties &s;hould be &s;ubject to the general laws relative to the duty of their office; the fix-teenth and &s;eventeenth give authority to ju&s;tices within their liberties, and declare, that per&s;ons within &s;uch liberties &s;hall not be compelled to appear before any ju&s;|tice out of the &s;ame liberties; the twenty-fir&s;t provides, that the bi&s;hops of Dur|ham and their temporal chancellors &s;hall be ju&s;tices of the peace within the county palatine, with as full powers as any other ju&s;tices of the realm.</P>
<P>Thus were the bi&s;hops of this See &s;tripped of their greate&s;t palatine honours. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions within the palatinate were not affected, but the chief regalities were removed. The reader will be&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h what diminution of privilege took place, by the prelate's future exerci&s;e of power, expre&s;&s;ed in the various records hereafter referred to.</P>
<P>An act al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed about this time, whereby tithes, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical pro|fits ari&s;ing during the vacancy of any &s;piritual promotion, were directed to belong to the per&s;on next pre&s;ented, towards the payment of fir&s;t-fruits.</P>
<P>A controver&s;y had ari&s;en between cardinal Pole and the king: Pole was of the blood royal, and cou&s;in-german to his maje&s;ty by both the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter; under the king's au&s;pices he had received a very liberal education, but from real principle di&s;&s;ented from the king's opinion, and wrote freely there|on: Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall, on account of his learning and judgment, was appointed to an&s;wer the cardinal's arguments, and &s;ome letters pa&s;&s;ed between them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biog.

<P>In the year 1540, mo&s;t of the larger mona&s;teries were &s;urrendered to the king; the priory of Durham was &s;urrendered by Hugh Whitehead, then prior, on the la&s;t day of December, in the 31&s;t year of this reign. An act was pa&s;&s;ed to ve&s;t all the religious hou&s;es, with their lands, rights, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in the crown; by force of which, the king, on the 12th of May, 1541, founded the cathedral church, and appointed a dean and twelve prebendaries therein for ever; dedica|ting the church to the glory of Chri&s;t and the honour of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, by the name of <HI>The Cathedral Church of Chri&s;t and ble&s;&s;ed Mary the Virgin;</HI> ordaining, that it &s;hould be the cathedral church and epi&s;copal &s;eat of the reverend father in Chri&s;t, Cuthbert, then bi&s;hop, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, bi&s;hops of Durham for ever. The king, by this foundation charter, appointed the &s;urrendering prior the fir&s;t dean, and twelve of the mo&s;t eminent of the fraternity prebendaries, whom he incorporated by the appellation of <HI>The Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral Chruch of Chri&s;t and ble&s;&s;ed Mary the Virgin,</HI> and granted them a common &s;eal, with power to the dean, for the time being, to appoint inferior officers and mini&s;ters of the church. By letters patent, dated the 16th day of May, 1541, the king en|dowed the church with all its former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, having previou&s;ly di&s;&s;olved the inferior mona&s;teries or cells which were dependant thereon: We find the manor and cell of Finchale, with the church and all things appertaining thereto, and the cell of Holy I&s;land, &s;pecified.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething irreconcileably incon&s;i&s;tent in the king's religious complex|ion; with one hand, at this time, he was enforcing the <HI>bloody &s;tatute,</HI> as it was cal|led, compul&s;ory as to the belief of &s;ix articles, which he intended &s;hould take away all imputation of his having quitted the original and rigid tenets of his religion;
<PB N="424" REF="473">and with the other he was holding out, by proclamation, the free u&s;e of the holy &s;criptures, and countenancing relaxations totally incompatible with the arbitrary rules of that &s;tatute. How our prelate reli&s;hed this conduct relative to the &s;crip|tures, after having bought up and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 413.</NOTE> burnt Tyndal's tran&s;lation, we are not told. Perhaps he was afterwards convinced of the utility of &s;uch liberality, or otherwi&s;e, from his univer&s;al temperance and excellence of mind, we may conclude, that what he did not actually approve, he refrained from &s;trengthening by a vain re&s;i&s;tance; for he mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that oppo&s;ition in matters of religion only &s;erved to blow up the flames of enthu&s;ia&s;m; and we find that, in 1541, a new edition of the Eng|li&s;h bible came out, revi&s;ed by him and Heath bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter. It is alledged, by an author of credit<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype, Appendix, p. 257.</NOTE>, that it was our bi&s;hop's fixed opinion, old u&s;ages were not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, without weighty rea&s;ons; and that &s;ome of them were in no wife to be broken.</P>
<P>Except that &s;ix bi&s;hoprics were founded out of the latter di&s;&s;olutions, few &s;uch appropriations as at Durham were made; the lands in general were profu&s;ely given to favourites and flatterers, the money lavi&s;hed in gaming, trivial amu&s;ements, and follies, and the &s;tate &s;o far from being relieved, lay as open and &s;ubject as ever to taxes on every emergency.</P>
<P>The king, become apprehen&s;ive of troubles from the continent, and &s;u&s;picious of the faith of Scotland, cau&s;ed the fortre&s;&s;es on the coa&s;t, and tho&s;e on the northern frontiers, to be repaired. Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall was at con&s;iderable expence in re&s;toring the ca&s;tle and bulwarks at Norham; &s;oon after which, ho&s;tilities were commenced on the borders, and Sir Robert Bowes, then governor of Norham, at the head of 3000 hor&s;emen, made an inroad, practi&s;ing the accu&s;tomed depredations and cruel|ties; but he was taken pri&s;oner, with his brother Richard, Sir William Mowbray, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of note. Henry was determined to bring the &s;tates of Scotland to terms, and al&s;o anxiou&s;ly hoped to revenge the affront the Scotti&s;h king had lately put upon him, by making him wait at York on a propo&s;ed interview, without appearing or &s;ending an excu&s;e. He a&s;&s;embled a great army at York, the command of which he gave to the duke of Norfolk, who entered Scotland in Oc|tober 1542, laid wa&s;te the country in his march, and reduced Kel&s;o and its beau|tiful abbey to a&s;hes. Nothing more material was effected by the Engli&s;h army. The Scotti&s;h leaders refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the borders at their &s;overeign's command, after which the di&s;graceful di&s;&s;ention prevailing in the army under Sinclair, which brought on their defeat by a handful of Engli&s;h cavalry, led by Dacre and Mu&s;|grave, gave the king of Scotland, who was &s;ubject to a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s of mind, as to bring him with a broken heart to the grave, leaving a daugh|ter (Mary) the heire&s;s to the crown, an infant not above a week old.</P>
<P>The queen had born king Henry a &s;on, who was named Edward, and &s;oon after departed this life. On the 6th of January 1540 the king married Ann of Cleves, again&s;t whom, at fir&s;t &s;ight, he entertained the &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion: He &s;ubmitted to the match merely from political principles, and in di&s;gu&s;t refu&s;ed to con&s;ummate his marriage. Cromwell, who had been created earl of E&s;&s;ex, and negociated this
<PB N="425" REF="474">marriage, provoked the king's di&s;plea&s;ure, was accu&s;ed of trea&s;on, and &s;uffered death. Thus fell an able &s;tate&s;man, one who had imbibed all the political maxims of cardinal Wol&s;ey, and lived to bring to maturity the projects his royal ma&s;ter had adopted, from the cardinal's devices, for extricating England from papal authority, and di&s;&s;olving the religious hou&s;es. A divorce was obtained to relieve the king from his marriage, and innumerable in&s;tances of the abject &s;ervility and depravity of parliament followed. On the 8th of Augu&s;t, Henry declared his marriage with Catharine Howard, the mo&s;t unhappy of his matrimonial engagements. On her accu&s;ation, the parliament not only found her guilty of the crimes imputed to her, but petitioned the king for her execution, together with her accomplices.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;olution of colleges and ho&s;pitals was now devi&s;ed, and the previous &s;teps thereto entered upon; but the mea&s;ures were not at that time fully carried into ex|ecution.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1543, the upper hou&s;e of convocation fir&s;t ordered the reading of the le&s;&s;ons in divine &s;ervice, beginning with a chapter in the New Te&s;tament, without any expo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In July 1543, Henry married his &s;ixth wife, Catharine Parr; and in the parlia|ment which met on the 14th of January 1544, an act was pa&s;&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, in which prince Edward and his heirs &s;tood fir&s;t; the king's i&s;&s;ue by queen Catharine Parr, &s;econd; the prince&s;s Mary, third; and prince&s;s Elizabeth, fourth. The king entertained a project of uniting the two kingdoms, by a marriage contract between his &s;on Edward and Mary prince&s;s of Scotland, which was oppo&s;ed by cardinal Beaton, the Wol&s;ey of Scotland, and con&s;equently much trouble en&s;ued on the borders. A treaty of peace and marriage alliance was entered into in the year 1543, but by the cardinal's intrigues and in|fluence, it was annulled by the &s;tates of Scotland; and in the following year the Engli&s;h army made an inroad, with the ordinary con&s;equences of depredation, pillage, and de&s;truction. Eure and Laton, two of the northern leaders, fell in this expedition; and it was not until the year 1546 that peace was concluded, which event was followed by the death of Beaton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Portraits belonging to the duke of Hamilton, in Holyrood-Hou&s;e: "A head of cardinal Beaton, black hair, &s;mooth face, a red callot.

Thus the foundations made for the benefit of learning and relief of the poor, which were &s;trengthened with the privilege of corporations, and intended for perpetuity, lo&s;t the &s;tability of their &s;ettlements, and lay at the mercy of the king.</P>

<P>Henry expired in the night of the 28th of January 1546-7, in the fifty-&s;ixth year of his age, having reigned near thirty-eight years. During this reign the &s;take &s;moaked with executions, whil&s;t the fluctuating and uncertain principles of the king's mind, in religious matters, di&s;played in contradictory expo&s;itions, rendered it very uncertain whether tho&s;e victims &s;uffered from mi&s;taken principles of policy, or the workings of &s;uper&s;tition and bigotry. The block was equally fatal, and &s;ome victims were &s;acrificed in a manner as &s;hocking as ever &s;tained the hands of tyranny. The breach of matrimonial faith, after a &s;eries of twenty years in the mo&s;t con&s;ummate conjugal felicity, was puni&s;hed amply in this life by infidelity and the tortures of a jealous mind, by the fatality which &s;natched from him the enjoy|ment of increa&s;ing affection, and by the &s;orrows of embittered aver&s;ion. But as the mo&s;t momentous events in the hand of Providence are frequently brought about by involuntary agents, and con&s;equential good proceeds from momentary evil, &s;o there was not the lea&s;t &s;park of patriotic principle in Henry's heart, conducing to aboli&s;h the authority of the See of Rome, or one breath of virtue to in&s;pire the wi&s;h of extingui&s;hing that &s;upremacy, which for &s;o many ages had impoveri&s;hed the &s;tate, and weakened the hands of government. To gratify his vices, to indulge his pa&s;&s;ions, and to maintain a determinate will, he pur&s;ued his project, redeemed his crown from a va&s;&s;alage of the mo&s;t inglorious nature, and his kingdom from grievous oppre&s;&s;ion. The di&s;&s;olution of religious hou&s;es proceeded from maxims equally unconnected with principle; he neither took the trouble to con&s;ider what effect the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e foundations had on the &s;tate, nor what benefit po&s;terity and their liberties would reap from their fall: The momentary idea of gain was all he cheri&s;hed, and the maintenance of his authority the only maxim, which urged him more than lucre. When we &s;ee his arguments on religious tenets, we are a&s;toni&s;hed at his erudition, his per&s;picuity, and &s;pecious piety; but his life demon&s;trates the&s;e were only vi&s;ions of the mind, which never reached his conduct. In no aera, of this or any other country, do we di&s;cover &s;o many good effects derived from &s;uch bad purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Henry's only &s;on &s;ucceeded to the throne, at the age of nine years, by the title of Edward the Sixth. In the li&s;t of regents appointed by the late king, we &s;ee our prelate's name: At the beginning of Edward's reign, he was one of the privy council, and of the king's council in the north. The fir&s;t effect we ob&s;erve of the new government was an abatement of the rigour of the &s;ix articles, and a vi&s;itation ordained, under which the advancing reformation gained new vigour, the commi&s;|&s;ioners being armed with certain articles of injunction, for the tenor of which the reader is referred to Fox, Fuller, Heylin, Sparrow, and Collier; only ob&s;erving, that Bonner bi&s;hop of London, and Gardiner bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, refu&s;ed to comply therewith.</P>
<P>The Scots now appearing turbulent, and unwilling to maintain the articles of peace, induced the Engli&s;h regency to march an army northward. An engagement happened near Mu&s;&s;elborough on the 10th of September, in which the Scots had a di&s;graceful rout, lo&s;ing a number of men almo&s;t equal to their adver&s;ary's whole force.

The bi&s;hopric therefore of Durham is utterly extingui&s;hed and di&s;&s;olved, and authority is given for letters patent, to erect the new bi&s;hoprics, together with a deanry and chapter at Newca&s;tle; with a provi&s;o, that the deanry, chapter, and cathedral of Durham &s;hould &s;uffer nothing by this act<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Burnet, part 2d, p. 215.</NOTE>."

Had there been a different de&s;ign at the bottom, the new erections would have been pur&s;ued, and the act taken its effect; this had been no more than a ju&s;t deference to the legi&s;lature: But this provi&s;ion was in a great mea|&s;ure overlooked, and the ma&s;k pulled off in a &s;hort time; for in May follow|ing, the temporalties of the bi&s;hopric were &s;eculari&s;ed, turned wholly to a county palatine, and granted to the duke of Northumberland.

<P>An act was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed, on the 2d of April 1554, to enable the queen to make &s;tatutes for collegiate churches; which act &s;ets forth, that Henry VIII. being em|powered to make &s;tatutes and ordinances, did deliver, by his commi&s;&s;ioners, certain ordinances to the &s;everal churches, in writing; but not being indented, as requi|red by the &s;tatute, were void or avoidable; and &s;uch power being only ve&s;ted in the king, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors could not make ordinances wi$hout the authority of parliament. This act, then, empowers the queen to make and pre&s;cribe the ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;tatutes and ordinances to &s;uch collegiate churches, under the great &s;eal, with a power to the queen to alter, augment, or dimini&s;h the &s;ame in her life-time.
<PB N="437" REF="486">This act was as much confined to the queen as the other was to the king, &s;o that any &s;tatutes afterwards made without authority of parliament, are of no validity. Bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall was employed to draw up the queen's &s;tatutes, of which the reader will be fully informed in the further progre&s;s of this work.</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted, that, <Q>on the 13th of March 1554, the bi&s;hop was put in &startq;commi&s;&s;ion with Gardiner, Bonner, and others, to deprive Robert Holgate arch|bi&s;hop of York, and John Bird, Robert Farrer, and Paul Bu&s;h, bi&s;hops of St &endq;David's, Che&s;ter, and Bri&s;tol, on account of their being married.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biog. Brit. p. 3982.</NOTE></Q> But this is not a true &s;tate of the fact; for the deprivation was not on account of their be|ing married, but for breaking the &s;olemn mona&s;tic vow of &s;ingle life: The words of the commi&s;&s;ion being, <HI>Po&s;t expre&s;&s;am profe&s;&s;ionem ca&s;titatis expre&s;&s;&egrave;, rit&egrave; &amp; legiti|m&egrave; emi&s;&s;am, cum quibu&s;dam mulieribus nuptias de facto, cum de jure non deberent con|traxi&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>In this year an act pa&s;&s;ed, by which the pope's authority was re&s;tored to the &s;ame &s;tate as before the 20th year of Henry VIII.'s reign, with &s;ome re&s;trictive articles, by which bi&s;hoprics, cathedrals, and colleges, were protected as they then were. The legate cardinal Pole, then in England, ratified the articles, with a denunciation of the judgment of God, on all the laymen who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed church lands.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the per&s;ecutions of Mary's reign &s;truck the nation with a panic, the bor|ders were in a turbulent &s;tate: Civil polity was much neglected, and the plunder|ing parties of each nation were con&s;tantly making depredations on the neighbour|ing country. Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed by the queen to hear and redre&s;s the border grievances; of tho&s;e, bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall was one, at a congre&s;s at Dun&s;e in 1556, and again at another congre&s;s at Carli&s;le in 1557, with the earl of We&s;tmor|land, Robert Hanmer chancellor of Durham, and others; but matters not being adju&s;ted, the war with France embroiling the two nations, open ho&s;tilities com|menced in the month of Augu&s;t, and were not &s;tayed during this reign; for on the 17th day of November 1558, the queen died, in the 43d year of her age, having reigned little more than five years. She was a bigot, and di&s;played much &s;tubborn re&s;entment, malice, and cruelty in her di&s;po&s;ition: She di&s;covered no political ca|pacity in her government; and, as a woman, had no character at all. Cardinal Pole, who figured in this reign, by his benevolent mind and gentlene&s;s of temper, exhibits a contra&s;t, which ca&s;ts upon &s;ome of the cotemporary prelates the a&s;pect of mon&s;ters and furies. If it had been po&s;&s;ible for bi&s;hop Burnet to have produced one in&s;tance in &s;upport of his a&s;&s;ertion, that the queen had a generous di&s;po&s;ition of mind, he would have uttered it; the mo&s;t partial eye in her favour cannot di&s;|cover it in hi&s;tory. Our prelate, as ob&s;erved before, was of gentle and tolerant principles, and is re&s;cued from the &s;uppo&s;ition of being a party in the cruelties and &s;everities of Mary's reign, by his being &s;een, in &s;everal hi&s;torical in&s;tances, in the commi&s;&s;ion for treating with the Scots, and in proof$ of his re&s;idence in his bi|&s;hopric during tho&s;e mi&s;erable times, which were marked with the deepe&s;t trage|dies. His dioce&s;e e&s;caped per&s;ecution, and was not &s;tained with the blood of one religious victim.</P>
<PB N="438" REF="487">
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth was a profound &s;hock to tho&s;e who were mo&s;t violent in per&s;ecution. She was crowned on the 14th of January 1558, by the bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, with the u&s;ual ceremonies and oaths. Her fir&s;t care was to repeal the &s;everal laws made in the reign of Mary touching matters of religion, and to revive tho&s;e of Henry VIII. and Edward VI. Soon after an act was pa&s;&s;ed, by which the bi&s;hops were barred from making any grants of their manors or farms for more than twenty-one years, or three lives, except to the crown. By another act, made in the fir&s;t year of this reign, cap. 19, <Q>Giving authority to the queen's maje&s;ty, &startq;upon the avoidance of any bi&s;hopric, to take into her hands certain of the tem|poral &endq;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions thereof,</Q> this See &s;uffered a great diminution in revenue; for by bi&s;hop Pilkington's addre&s;s to &s;ecretary Cecil, &s;et forth in the cour&s;e of this work, it appears the queen &s;eized upon Norham and the &s;hire, of the yearly value of 120 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Ea&s;ington ward 323 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Ea&s;ington Coronator 72 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Sadberge 23 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> os. 11 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Cotom Mundevil 47 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 16 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Middleham 19 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 11 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Gate&s;|head 24 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Creik 39 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Allerton and the &s;hire 218 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> &frac14;, a pen&s;ion out of Howden 91 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> &frac12;, which were not re&s;tored till the year 1565. The act for e&s;tabli&s;hing the Engli&s;h common form of prayer, was &s;ucceeded by a tender of the oath of &s;upremacy to the bi&s;hops and clergy, which was refu&s;ed by all the prelates except the bi&s;hop of Landaff: The con&s;equence of &s;uch refu&s;al, among other in&s;tances, was the deprivation of bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall.

Being there|fore deprived in July 1559, for refu&s;ing the oath of &s;upremacy, he was com|mitted to Matthew Parker archbi&s;hop elect of Canterbury<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The intention of this captivity &s;eems evidently to have proceeded from hopes of bringing over this ve|$$rable prelate to the maxims adopted by the queen for encouragement of the reformation: His learning and integrity gave him great weight, and it was of con&s;equence to win his influence of po&s;&s;ible: He was held in the highe&s;t veneration by the people of his palatinate, and his example and doctrines would have prevailed with multitudes there. To bring over this holy man was a work appointed to the archbi&s;hop; but bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall's age and declining health afforded little encouragement to the de&s;ign: Opinions and determina|tions grow more ob&s;tinate by age and infirmities; it was too late in life for any impul&s;e to prevail.</NOTE>, in free cu&s;tody, where he was entertained in a mo&s;t kind, friendly, and brother-like manner<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Before his death, he declared it his judgment, that the pope's too far extended power ought to be re|&s;trained within his own dioce&s;e of Rome; letters to which purpo&s;e he had long before written to cardinal Pole, unto which mind he now returned again, after his compliance with the pope under Mary; and not above fourteen days before his death, while he lived with the archbi&s;hop, he te&s;tified to him and others tho&s;e $$tters to Pole to be his, one of which is extant in Fox's Monuments, writ about 1534, and others of th$$$ $word$ in MS. in the Cotton library.

<P><Q>&startq;This prelate had &s;een as great a variety of fortune as mo&s;t men; he had lived in difficult and in ea&s;y times; he had known both prote&s;tants and papi&s;ts in power, and yet, from all parties<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Era&s;mus.&mdash;Sir Tho. Mo$e.</NOTE> and in all revolutions of government, he had found favour. The truth is, he was well ver&s;ed in the arts of temporizing, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;hare of that complying philo&s;ophy, which, taking offence at no|thing, can adapt it&s;elf to all things. When Harry the Eighth began to innovate, the bi&s;hop of Durham had no &s;cruples; when his &s;on went further, &s;till the bi|&s;hop was quiet, and owed indeed his confinement at the clo&s;e of that reign to his de&s;ire of continuing &s;o. Again, when queen Mary rever&s;ed what they had done, with this too the bi&s;hop was &s;atisfied, and forgot all his former profe&s;&s;ions. Thus much, however, may ju&s;tly be &s;aid of him, that upon all occa&s;ions, and where no &s;ecular ends were in view, he &s;hewed him&s;elf a man of great modera|tion;
<PB N="440" REF="489">and whether in his heart he was more papi&s;t or prote&s;tant, to arbitrary proceedings, however, in either per&s;ua&s;ion, he was wholly aver&s;e. Thus he thought things were carried too far on one &s;ide in king Edward's time, and too far on the other in queen Mary's; with both reigns he was therefore di&s;&s;atisfied, though he was too great a lover of his own ea&s;e to oppo&s;e them. But as his days &s;hortened, his ambition decrea&s;ed, his con&s;cience grew more tender, and what he had done for Harry and Edward, he refu&s;ed to do again for Elizabeth. Though the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury is of opinion, he was not with-held by any &s;cru|ples, but &s;uch as a &s;en&s;e of decency rai&s;ed, from complying with that prince&s;s: He was very old, and thought it looked better to undergo the &s;ame fate with his brethren, than to be &s;till changing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>; and this is the rather probable, becau&s;e many hi&s;torians &s;ay, the late reign had given him a great di&s;gu&s;t to popery, and that he would often own to archbi&s;hop Parker he began to think every day more favourably of the reformers. In private life his manners were highly commen|dable: He had an ab&s;olute command over him&s;elf; a temper which no accident could di&s;compo&s;e, great humanity, and great good-nature. In learning, few of his cotemporaries were equal to him; none more ready to patroni&s;e it. Of the offices of friend&s;hip he was a &s;trict ob&s;erver; and was not only a favourer, but a zealous encourager of good men. In a word, where he was not immediately under the influence of court maxims, he gave the example of a true Chri&s;tian &endq;bi&s;hop<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gilpin's Life of Bern Gilpin, p. 118.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In 1558, the fortifications of Berwick were ordered to be &s;trengthened, and ad|ditional forces were rai&s;ed, to oppo&s;e a de&s;cent the French had projected making near Newca&s;tle: Of tho&s;e new levies, the bi&s;hopric of Durham was required to rai&s;e five hundred men<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Orders were &s;ent to the bi&s;hop of Durham to &s;end men from the bi&s;hopric, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.

<P>Mr Noble gives three &s;pecimens of the coin of this prelate: <Q>N^o 1. a penny, &startq;differs &s;carcely in any one circum&s;tance from tho&s;e of Wol&s;ey's &s;econd coinage,
<PB N="444" REF="493">upon the obver&s;e; the rever&s;e has this legend, CIVITAS DVRRAM; upon the &s;ides of the &s;hield, above the bar, are C. D. for <HI>Cuthbertus Dunelmen&s;is.</HI> N^o 2. is al&s;o a penny of this prelate; the chair is the only difference, upon the obver&s;e, from N^o 1. the arms of which are broader, and the ornaments at the top of them are &s;eemingly meant for mitres; the rever&s;e reads, CIVITAS DVRHAM; the fir&s;t initial is blundered, being an E, as they were then made, &s;et the contrary way; this, however, is evidently only a mi&s;take of the engraver for a C; and as the other letter is a D, they mu&s;t be read Cuth. Dunelmen&s;is. N^o 3. has the &s;ame legends as N^o 1. but it has not the lea&s;t appearance, in other re&s;pects, of an epi&s;copal coin; the arms of the chair are plain, and the re|ver&s;e is without any initials; it has the &s;tar for the mint-mark, as N^o 1. and 2. and which mo&s;t, if not all of bi&s;hop Tun&s;tall's have: This coin was probably &s;truck, ju&s;t before Henry deprived this See, and the two metropolitical ones, of the privilege of a mint; and to avoid that jealou&s;y which the king di&s;covered at the&s;e charters, it might be judged prudent to omit every epi&s;copal and local di&s;tinction that could give offence. There is no notice (in the act of Hen. VIII.) taken of the mints, either of Durham, or tho&s;e of the primates: However, there is not a doubt but that their abolition was under&s;tood by the preface to it. It was not then, perhaps, thought nece&s;&s;ary to be very exact in wording it; few &s;ubjects being hardy enough to di&s;pute the will of &s;o powerful and tyrannic &endq;a prince as Henry VIII.</Q></P>

<P>During this prelate's time, not only the cau&s;e of religion, but al&s;o political matters, called the queen's attention towards Scotland; and the borders were fre|quently the &s;cene of military operations.

The earl of Bedford in 1565 was governor of Berwick, warden of the ea&s;tern march, and lieutenant-general of the forces: It is added, he was lord-lieutenant of the counties of Northumberland, Cumber|land, We&s;tmorland, and the bi&s;hopric of Durham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memor.

One Nicholas Norton was a great incendiary in this commotion. He is &s;aid to have been &s;ent from the pope for this purpo&s;e, and had in&s;tructions to declare the queen an heretic, &endq;and that &s;he had forfeited her dominions for her di&s;belief.</Q> The earl of Nor|thumberland lay at Topcliff, at his hou&s;e there, before he openly took up arms; and being informed in the night of the 14th of November, that a &s;cheme was laid for &s;eizing his per&s;on, he ro&s;e ha&s;tily from his bed, and withdrew to the earl of We&s;tmorland, then at Brancepeth, where their dependents came in to them. On mar&s;halling their army, they publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, in which they &s;et forth, <Q>&startq;That they had taken the field, only to re&s;tore the religion of their ance&s;tors, to remove evil coun&s;ellors, to enlarge the duke of Norfolk lately impri&s;oned, and recommend other di&s;countenanced men of quality to the queen's favour: As for her maje&s;ty, they were, and re&s;olved to be always, her mo&s;t obedient &s;ub|jects, &endq;and &s;hould never attempt any thing again&s;t her.</Q> Be&s;ides this manife&s;to, they &s;ent circular letters to the Roman catholics, to exert them&s;elves, and join them: But the&s;e men, as Camden &s;ays, were &s;o far from clo&s;ing with the invita|tion, that mo&s;t of them &s;ent up their letters, with tho&s;e that brought them, to the queen; and, from all quarters of the kingdom, offered the crown their a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the rebels. The chief banner the in&s;urgents di&s;played, had the crucifixion repre&s;ented thereon, with Chri&s;t's five wounds, which was borne by Richard Nor|ton, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Norton-Coniers, who, with his &s;ons, Chri&s;topher, Marmaduke, and Thomas, (expre&s;sly named by Camden) di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion; the banners of the two earls are named in the old ballad given in the notes. They marched to Durham, where, meeting with no oppo&s;ition, they entered the churches, tore and defaced the bibles and common-prayers, and celebrated ma&s;s
<PB N="451" REF="501">with the ancient ceremonies. They propo&s;ed to proceed immediately to York; but receiving intelligence, that the queen of Scots was removed to Coventry, that the earl of E&s;&s;ex had rai&s;ed a powerful army again&s;t them, that Sir Robert Bowes had commanded a number of forces then almo&s;t upon their rear, and the lord Scroop and earl of Cumberland had &s;trengthened Carli&s;le, they turned fir&s;t to Rabyca&s;tle, one of the earl of We&s;tmorland's &s;eats, and thence to Barnardca&s;tle, which was &s;hut again&s;t them by Sir George Bowes; at which they were &s;o much irritated, that they determined to reduce it before they advanced farther, and &s;pent eleven days in a &s;iege before the fortre&s;s was &s;urrendered. The army ad|vanced to Clifford-Moor, near Wetherby, where the mu&s;ter-roll was called over$ and it was found their troops con&s;i&s;ted only of 4000 foot and 600 hor&s;e. The two earls, who &s;pent their large revenues in ho&s;pitality, and were much beloved on that account, were ma&s;ters of little ready money; the earl of Northumberland brought with him only 2000 crowns, and the earl of We&s;tmorland no ca&s;h for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their forces; from whence they were unable to proceed: They were di&s;appointed in the &s;upport they expected both in men and money. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, the earl of We&s;tmorland began &s;o vi&s;ibly to de&s;pond, that many of his men &s;hrunk away, though the earl of Northumberland &s;till kept up his re&s;olution, and was ma&s;ter of the field till the 13th of December; when the earl of E&s;&s;ex, accompanied by lord Hun&s;don, having marched out of York at the head of 7000 men, and being followed by a &s;till larger army under the com|mand of Ambro&s;e Dudley earl of Warwick, the rebels retreated northwards, fir&s;t to Raby, then to Auckland and Hexham, and la&s;tly to Naworth-ca&s;tle, from whence the earls e&s;caped into Scotland: The earl of We&s;tmorland fled to Flan|ders, where he led a very poor life, even to an advanced old age, living on a &s;lender and ill-paid pen&s;ion from the crown of Spain; but the earl of Northum|berland was &s;urrendered by a treacherous borderer, and &s;uffered decapitation at York. Though this in&s;urrection was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed with &s;o little blood&s;hed in war|fare, the earl of E&s;&s;ex, and Sir George Bowes mar&s;hal of the army, delighting in &s;laughter, put va&s;t numbers to death by martial law, without any regular trial: Sixty-&s;ix people were executed at Durham; among whom were Plumtree a prie&s;t, Struther an alderman, and &s;everal peace officers; many others were put to death at York, and &s;ome removed to London: Sir George Bowes made an inhuman boa&s;t, that in a tract of country, &s;ixty miles in length, and forty in breadth, betwixt Newca&s;tle and Wetherby, there was &s;carce a town or village wherein he had not &s;acrificed &s;ome of the inhabitants to his thir&s;t of blood.

<P>Bi&s;hop Pilkington being the fir&s;t prote&s;tant prelate that held the bi&s;hopric of Durham, was obliged to keep out of the way of the in&s;urgents.

He adds, The&s;e afterwards, with four thou&s;and pounds a-piece, were married; the one to Sir James Harrington, the other to Mr Dunce of Berk&s;hire; which portions the courtiers of that age did behold with envious eyes, for which the bi&s;hopric &endq;&s;ped no whit the better<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">b. ix. p. 109.</NOTE>.</Q> In another place<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">b. v. p. 253.</NOTE>, <Q>And I have heard, that &startq;queen Elizabeth, being informed that Dr Pilkington bi&s;hop of Durham had given 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in marriage with his daughters, and being offended that a prelate's daughter &s;hould equal a prince&s;s, in future took away 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year from that bi&s;hopric, and a&s;&s;igned it for the better maintenance of the garri&s;on &endq;Berwick.</Q> This payment continued for &s;ome time after the bi&s;hop's death.</P>

He was &s;till alive, but by rea&s;on of his age very much pinched by the winter's cold in that northern part of the nation. The queen required re&s;idence of her bi&s;hops in their dio|$$es; and would not permit them to come up to London without &s;pecial leave; that they might keep ho&s;|pitality, and their pre&s;ence might awe the papi&s;ts, &s;pecially in tho&s;e parts. It was now September in the de|$lining of the year, when this good bi&s;hop &s;ignified to the lord trea&s;urer, both his de&s;ire to come into the&s;e &s;outhern quarters for the avoiding the extremity of the winter &s;ea&s;on, and al&s;o his pious acquie&s;cence in God's di&s;po&s;al of him, what ever &s;hould happen. For the&s;e were his words to that lord, <HI>That the common griefs that he had &s;uffered there for &s;undry winters pa&s;t, made him to think what he &s;hould look for the winter that was then at hand. That it had begun &s;o &s;harply with him already, that he feared the latter end would he wor&s;e: And therefore, if his lord&s;hip thought good to move her maje&s;ty, that he might come up this winter, he &s;hould de|&s;ire him to let him under&s;tand her highne&s;s's plea&s;ure.

<P>All parcels of the county palatine.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of this bu&s;ine&s;s the bi&s;hop &s;et down after this manner in a letter to Cecil, hoping to have &s;ome order by his means:</P>
<P><HI>GRATIA &amp; Pax.</HI> I have &s;ent your honour a note of &s;uch lands as be detained from me, with the valor of them, as the lord trea&s;urer rated them. Norham, and the &s;hire, is exempted from Cumberland, and made part of the county palatine of Durham, and of as great liberties. So is Creik in al things from York|&s;hire. And al &s;uits and pri&s;oners come to Durham. Allerton has great liberties, but not fully &s;o much. Al other parcels lie within the county of Durham.</P>
<P>The inconveniences in detaining them, as the lawyers &s;ay, is &s;uch, that al &s;uch as holde any lands within the&s;e parcels of the bi&s;hop. cannot &s;ell, nor aliene, nor make a good conveyance or &s;tate in law, to any per|&s;on; not &s;o much as a jointure to his wife, as hath been proved of late; nor &s;ell any part after his office found. Becau&s;e the bi&s;hop cannot give him his <HI>liberate</HI> of them: As even now is in experience by one Clax|ton, that &s;old his land to Perkin&s;on. Who procured divers of the councils letters, that I would grant him his <HI>liverie.</HI> Which I cannot, being exempted from me. Nor the queen's maje&s;ty nauther can graunt it him; for that &s;he holdeth them contrary to law. And having not his liverie, &s;ay the lawyers, <HI>Nullum ei re&s;tat liberum tenementum.</HI> The like is judged to be in copyholders and lea&s;es al&s;o. Which cau&s;eth great murmurings among the people, and maketh many intruders and u&s;urpers. Whereof mu&s;t needs i&s;&s;ue infinite &s;uits, brawlings, and quarrellings. Which I am &s;orry &s;hould chance in the time, or by occa&s;ion of any that profe&s;&s;es Chri&s;t's Go&s;pel. And &s;urely the people &s;ay, this is the fruit of our religion, to procure &s;uch mi&s;|chiefs. I can wi&s;h the amendment of it, but God mu&s;t work it. And for my own part, I wil be no partaker of any &s;uch injuries to &s;o many people, &s;o farre as I may avoid it.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it were time. The danger is great; The &s;hire is &s;mal. And yet if any of the wardens of the marches &s;end for aid to the bi&s;hop on the &s;udden, he mu&s;t give them help. The &s;hire is divided into four wards. Of which is detained from me a ward and an half. There be &s;even lords within the &s;hire, Northum|berland, Cumberland, We&s;tmorland, Dacres, Evers, Scrope, Lumley; that have great lands and liberties; where the bi&s;hop hath not to do. Be&s;ide the dean and chapter, and the great liberty of the queen's maje&s;ty's lands in Bernard's Ca&s;tle, and other &s;uppre&s;t lands; of which none be at the bi&s;hop's command. Al the&s;e being taken from the bi&s;hop, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee what aid the bi&s;hop &s;hall be able to give in time of need. For none of the others do &s;turre without &s;pecial commandment from the prince: Nor be at the warden's com|mandment.</P>
<P>But this harm is not only in war, but in commi&s;&s;ions, juries, carriages, &amp;c. None, or &s;ew of the&s;e, do &s;erve the queen, &s;ave only the bi&s;hop's tenants, and few of the poorer freeholders. The commodities, which be thought great for the ward&s;hip, marriages, and reliefs, I a&s;&s;ure your honour, are very &s;mal. For every man almo&s;t hath purcha&s;ed &s;uppre&s;t lands, and &s;o become wards to the queen. Truly, I have had only one poor relief the&s;e five years, of 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> for al offices that were found. Coals, which is the great commodity of the country, there is none at al within the&s;e detained lands; nor wood, &s;aving a little at Allerton: Out of my woods, I give the tenants of the&s;e detained lands for their reparations. This commodity I have by it. Be&s;ides, that I pay the queen's maje&s;ty her rent duly, although they pay me &s;lowly.</P>
<P>God graunt, that the&s;e things may be duly con&s;idered; and then it wil ea&s;ily appear, whether I &s;eek mine own profit, or the advancement of ju&s;tice, and avoiding of injuries and mi&s;chiefs to many people, 'The Lord long pre&s;erve you to &s;erve him, and his people to his glory, their confort, and your heart's ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Yours wholly JA. DURESME.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop, who was thus diligent and con&s;cientions in &s;oliciting the recovery of the lands and lord&s;hips afore&s;aid, for the good of his church, was at la&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, and did obtain the re&s;toration of them again, by the good a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cecil; but &s;till with the burthen of a con&s;iderable rent-charge to be paid to the queen, her heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, of 1020 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly, as appears by an authentic paper, expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ame; that is, for the manors and lord&s;hips &s;ituate in the county of York and bi&s;hopric of Durham 880 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> For tho&s;e in Northumberland and Eland&s;hire, in the county of Northumberland 140 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> The&s;e lands were re|tained by virtue of an act of parliament made in the fir&s;t year of the queen.</P>
<P>The paper (belonging to bi&s;hop Hutton's time) bears this title: "A parcel of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions late of the bi|&s;hopric of Durham, now retained in the hands of our &s;overeign lady Elizabeth, by vertue of an act of parli|ament in the fir&s;t year of her reign." And then are &s;et down the names of the lord&s;hips and manors &s;ituate in the counties of York and Durham. And then follows: <HI>Quae omnia praemi&s;&s;a conce&s;&s;a fuerunt Jacobo nuper epi&s;copo Dunelmen&s;i; ac modo Matthaeo epi&s;copo Dunelmen&s;i: Reddendo inde dominae reginae, haeredibus &amp; &s;ucce&s;&s;o|ribus &s;uis per annum</HI> 880 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> And after this, there is a particular of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Northumberland; and the yearly payments for them, viz. 140 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; and then, at the bottom thereof is writ, "Memorandum, the&s;e two &s;ums above-mentioned have been yearly an&s;wered to her maje&s;ty, &s;ince the fir&s;t retaining of the &s;ame hitherto."</P>
<P>He commenced a &s;uite with queen Elizabeth in the 13th year of her reign 1571, for forfeitures of the lands and goods of Charles Nevil earl of We&s;tmoreland and other outlaws in the county, who had been in actual rebellion again&s;t their country; and had pro&s;ecuted this &s;uite if the parliament had not interpo&s;ed, when an act was pa&s;&s;ed for attainting the earl and others of the rebellion, the bi&s;hop's right to the forfeitures within the county palatine is thereby declared and &s;aved, tho' for that time the charge of the war to re&s;cue the bi|&s;hopric and &s;uppre&s;s that rebellion, and other rea&s;ons of &s;tate, occa&s;ioned them to be given to the queen upon &s;ome recompence to the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Upon the re&s;toration of king Charles II. in the 12th year of his reign 1661, an act of parliament was made which took away the court of wards and all ward&s;hips through the kingdom.</P></NOTE>.</P>

The bi&s;hop proceeds in his account to the following effect: <Q>I have an external &s;hew of &s;ome dutiful obedience, but &startq;their dealings underhand are nothing le&s;s; &s;o that I &s;ear I &s;hall be enforced to weary his honour and the lords with the reforming their di&s;orders, which are more than as yet I am well able to undergo.

<P>Bi&s;hop Barnes was in enmity with archbi&s;hop Grindal, and &s;poke di&s;re&s;pectfully of him, which occa&s;ioned the lord-trea&s;urer Burleigh to write to him &s;oon after the archbi&s;hop's di&s;grace. Barnes, in his an&s;wer, maintains an equivocal &s;tile, and, courtier like, throws out imputations on the archbi&s;hop for contempt of the regal power, but doth not charge him with want of &s;incerity towards the church. Strype, who gives an account of this corre&s;pondence, &s;ays, <Q>That bi&s;hop Barnes &startq;had no good-will towards the archbi&s;hop, who, not long before, had dealt again&s;t him for &s;ome defects, either in di&s;charge of his epi&s;copal function, or for his &endq;bribe-taking officers.</Q> This leads us to ob&s;erve, that he countenanced the mo&s;t rapacious acts in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court of his dioce&s;e, where John Barnes his bro|ther pre&s;ided as chancellor, and was the tyrant of the country; con&s;idering his power only as the means of gratifying his vicious inclinations, among which, as avarice bore a ruling part, oppre&s;&s;ion was a natural effect. It appears probable that the bi&s;hop decried the people to prejudice the mini&s;ter's ear, and &s;hut it again&s;t their complaints; that the cu&s;toms and lives of the palatinates were depict|ed &s;avage, to cover their cries; and that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court was the Augean &s;table, which no labour could clean&s;e of its iniquity. Between this infamous chancellor and the truly apo&s;tolic Bernard Gilpin there was an oppo&s;ition for many years; the latter endeavouring to counteract the former, and to be the redre&s;&s;er of tho&s;e injuries of which he was the author: Tho&s;e matters perhaps irri|tated the mind of our prelate again&s;t that good divine; &s;ome warm animadver&s;ions pa&s;t between them; and the great lines of this prelate's character appear in the following circum&s;tances, as related in the Briti&s;h Biography, vol. iii. p. 117.&mdash;
<PB N="464" REF="514"><Q>&startq;Gilpin received a me&s;&s;age one day from the bi&s;hop of Durham, appointing him to preach a vi&s;itation &s;ermon on Sunday following: It happened he was then preparing for his journey into Read&s;dale and Tynedale; he acquainted the bi&s;hop therefore with the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping that appointment, begging his lord&s;hip would at that time excu&s;e him. His &s;ervant informed him that the bi&s;hop had received his me&s;&s;age, but returned no an&s;wer: Concluding him therefore &s;atis|fied, he &s;et out on his journey; but was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, on his return home, to find him&s;elf &s;u&s;pended; &s;ome per&s;ons, through enmity to him, having put the bi&s;hop on this ha&s;ty &s;tep. A few days after, he received an order to meet the bi&s;hop at Che&s;ter: Here many of the clergy were a&s;&s;embled, and Mr Gilpin was ordered by the bi&s;hop to preach that day before them. He made many excu&s;es, and al|ledged that he had come wholly unprepared. The bi&s;hop would not, however, admit of any of his apologies, but required him, upon his canonical obedience, to go immediately into the pulpit. After a little delay, therefore, he went up; and though he ob&s;erved &s;everal taking notes of what he &s;aid, he proceeded with|out the lea&s;t he&s;itation. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical court at Durham was at that time very &s;candalou&s;ly governed: The bi&s;hop was a weak man, irre&s;olute, and wholly in the hands of others: Every thing was managed by his relation chancellor Barnes, who&s;e venality, and the irregularities occa&s;ioned by it, were mo&s;t noto|rious. This induced Mr Gilpin to lay hold of the pre&s;ent opportunity to open the bi&s;hop's eyes; private information had often been given to the prelate, but without &s;ucce&s;s. Mr Gilpin was now re&s;olved, therefore, to venture upon a pub|lic application to him: Accordingly, before he concluded his &s;ermon, he turned towards the bi&s;hop, to whom he thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf: 'My di&s;cour&s;e now, reverend father, mu&s;t be directed to you. God hath exalted you to be the bi|&s;hop of this dioce&s;e, and requireth an account of your government thereof. A reformation of all tho&s;e matters which are ami&s;s in this church is expected at your hands. And now, le&s;t perhaps while it is apparent that &s;o many enormities are committed every-where, your lord&s;hip &s;hould make an&s;wer, that you had no no|tice of them given you, and that the&s;e things never came to your knowledge,' (for it &s;eems this was the bi&s;hop's common apology to all complaints)," 'be|hold, I bring the&s;e things to your knowledge this day. Say not then that the&s;e crimes have been committed by the fault of others, without your knowledge; for whatever either your&s;elf &s;hall do in per&s;on, or &s;uffer through your connivance to be done by others, is wholly your own. <HI>Therefore in the pre&s;ence of God, his an|gels, and men, I pronounce you to be the author of all the&s;e evils; yea, and in that &s;trict day of the general account, I will be witne&s;s to te&s;tify again&s;t you, that all the&s;e things have come to your knowledge by my means; and all the&s;e men &s;hall bear witne&s;s thereof, who have heard me &s;peak unto you this day.'</HI> "This freedom alarmed every one; the bi&s;hop, they &s;aid, had now got that advantage over him that had been long &s;ought for: His friends expo&s;tulated with him on what he had done; but Mr Gilpin a&s;&s;ured them, that if his di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould do the &s;ervice he intend|ed by it, he was regardle&s;s what the con&s;equence might be to him&s;elf. He after|wards went to the bi&s;hop to pay his compliments before he went home. 'Sir,
<PB N="465" REF="515">&s;ays the bi&s;hop, I propo&s;e to wait upon you home my&s;elf.' This he accordingly did; and as &s;oon as Mr Gilpin had carried him into a parlour, the bi&s;hop turned &s;uddenly round, and &s;eizing him eagerly by the hand, 'Father Gilpin, &s;ays he, I acknowledge you are fitter to be bi&s;hop of Durham than I am to be par&s;on of this church of yours.&mdash;I a&s;k forgivene&s;s for pa&s;t injuries!&mdash;forgive me, father! I know you have enemies; but, while I live bi&s;hop of Durham, be &s;ecure, none &endq;of them &s;hall cau&s;e you any further trouble.</Q></P>

<P>He vi&s;ited his cathedral church in the year 1580, repaired the palace at Stock|ton, and laid out a con&s;iderable &s;um at Auckland and Durham. In the twenty-fir&s;t year of Elizabeth, he got exemplified many ancient grants relative to the See, from the reign of Henry V. to the eighth year of her maje&s;ty; and in the twenty-third of that reign he had a &s;uit with his copyholders in Allerton&s;hire, in the court of reque&s;ts, for &s;ettling their fines, which his officers had aggravated beyond the ancient cu&s;tomary rule.</P>
<P>Dean Matthews, who had an eye to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e was de&s;irous of &s;aving the bi&s;hopric from depredations which were then devi&s;ed at court, in a letter to Francis Mills, then attending on &s;ecretary Wal&s;ingham, repre&s;ents its deplorable &s;tate in the following expre&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype's Ann. vol. ii. p. 463.</NOTE>: <Q>The bi&s;hopric greatly impaired; the be&s;t &startq;things of it demi&s;ed at length, and no provi&s;ion at all of corn by rent or other|wi&s;e.

<P>N. B. The annexed portrait of bi&s;hop Matthew is copied from Boi&s;&s;ard. There is a painting of him in the hall of Chri&s;t Church, Oxon; and another in the bi&s;hop's library at Durham.</P></NOTE>, and born in that part of the city which lies in Somer&s;et&s;hire. He received the fir&s;t ru|diments of learning in the city of Wells; and at the age of thirteen became a &s;tudent in the univer&s;ity of Oxford, in the beginning of the year 1559. In Chri&s;t-Church college he took the degree of bachelor of arts, on the 11th of February 1563; and, on the 25th of June 1566, was made ma&s;ter of arts: About which time he took holy orders, and was greatly re&s;pected for his learning, eloquence, conver&s;ation, friendly di&s;po&s;ition, and the &s;harpne&s;s of his wit. On the 2d day
<PB N="473" REF="525">of November 1569 he was unanimou&s;ly elected public orator of the univer&s;ity, which office he filled to the honour of his electors, and with great applau&s;e. In the year 1570 he was made canon of the &s;econd &s;tall in the cathedral of Chri&s;t-Church, and on the 28th of November following was admitted archdeacon of Bath. In 1571 he petitioned for his degree of bachelor of divinity, but was not admitted thereto for two years. In 1572 he was made prebendary of Teynton-Regis with Yalmeton in the church of Sali&s;bury, and in July following was elected pre&s;ident of St John's college in Oxford; at which time, being in high reputation as a preacher, he was appointed one of the queen's chaplains in ordinary. On the 10th of December 1573 he was admitted bachelor of divinity; and in the next year, on the 27th of May, proceeded doctor. On the 14th of June 1576, being archdeacon of Bath, he was commi&s;&s;ioned by archbi&s;hop Grindal, with &s;ome others, to vi&s;it the church, city, and deanry of Bri&s;tol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strype's Grind. p. 211.</NOTE>. In the &s;ame year he was made dean of Chri&s;t-Church; and then obtained, from the pen of Camden, the di&s;tingui&s;hed character of <HI>Theologus prae&s;tanti&s;&s;imus;</HI> who &s;ays, that in him <HI>doctrina cum pietate &amp; ars cum natura certant</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edm.

<P>Let us now &s;ee him de&s;cribed by another per&s;on (Hi&s;t. and Antiq. Oxon, lib. ii. p. 255.). "Infinitae prope|modum lectionis vir, librum pene nullum, quem vel &s;criptoris fama vel ip&s;um operis argumentum com|mendaret, intactum praetermi&s;it; memoriam quoque tam tenacem habuit, ut legenti &s;e&s;e pauci&s;lima obtu|lerint quae non, &s;iquando u&s;us flagitaret, confe&s;tim proferret."</P>
<P>Sir Sir John Harrington gives us the following account of him: "During his abode there, being dean of Chri&s;t-Church, it was hard to &s;ay whether he was more re&s;pected for his great fearning, eloquence, autho|rity, countenance given him by the queen and the great ones; or beloved for his &s;weet conver&s;ation, friend|ly di&s;po&s;ition, bounty, that even then &s;hewed it&s;elf, and above all, a chearful &s;harpne&s;s of wit, that &s;o &s;auced all his words and behaviour, that well was he in the univer&s;ity, who could be in the company of Toby Mat|thew; and his name grew &s;o popular and plau&s;ible, that they thought it a derogation to their love to add any title of doctor or dean to it; but if they &s;pake of one of his men, as he was ever well attended, they would &s;ay Mr Matthew, or Mr Toby Matthew's men.&mdash;View, &amp;c. p. 196.&mdash;Le Neve, p. 97.</P></NOTE>; <HI>virtutum &amp; pietatis ornamentis erudita facundia &amp; docendi a&s;|&s;iduitate reverendi&s;&s;imum exi&s;tere.</HI> In 1579 he &s;erved the office of vice-chancellor of the univer&s;ity<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fuller &s;ays, that none could condemn him for his chearful &s;pirit, though often he would condemn him|&s;elf for the levity of it; yet he was &s;o habituated therein, that he could as well not be as not be merry. Pun and quibble were then in high vogue, and a man was to expect no preferment in that age, either in church or &s;tate, who was not a proficient in that kind of wit. He is reported to have &s;aid, at his leaving Durham for a benefice of le&s;s income, that it was <HI>for lack of grace.</HI> Sir. J. Harrington and Mr Fuller have thought fit to record two or three remarkable &s;tories, which we &s;hall beg leave to &s;ubjoin, for the reader's better notion of our prelate's readine&s;s in this way. <Q>Being vice-chancellor of Oxford, and &s;ome &s;light matters &startq;and men coming before him, one man was very importunate to have the court &s;tay for his coun&s;el. Who is your coun&s;el? &s;ays the vice-chancellor. Mr <HI>Lea&s;teed,</HI> an&s;wers the man. Alas, replies the vice-chan|cellor, no man can &s;tand you in <HI>le&s;s &s;tead.</HI> No remedy! adds the other&mdash;Nece&s;&s;ity has no law! In|deed, &endq;quoth he, no more I think has your chancellor.</Q>
<P><Q>&startq;Another man was to be bound in a bond, very like to be forfeited, and came in great ha&s;te to offer it, &s;aying, he would be bound if he might be <HI>taken in:</HI> Yes, &s;ays the judge, I think <HI>you will be taken in;</HI> what is your name? <HI>Cox,</HI> &s;ays the party, and &s;o pre&s;&s;ed, as the manner is, to come into court. Make &endq;him room there, &s;aid the chancellor; let that <HI>Cox come</HI> in.</Q>&mdash;Le Neve, p. 98.</P></NOTE>. At a convocation held in 1580, archbi&s;hop Grindal being then under the queen's di&s;plea&s;ure, it was agreed, that our prelate, then dean of
<PB N="474" REF="526">Chri&s;t-Church, &s;hould, in the name of that a&s;&s;embly, draw up an humble addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty, for the archbi&s;hop's re&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the addre&s;s in Le Neve, p. 100.</NOTE>; but it was not received favourably. On the 22d day of June 1583 he was collated to the precentor&s;hip of Sali&s;bury, and the third of September following was made dean of Durham, being then 37 years of age, whereupon he re&s;igned the precentor&s;hip. <Q>From this time to the &startq;23d Sunday after Trinity, in the year 1622, he kept an account of all the &s;er|mons he preached, the place where, the time when, the text what, and if any at court, or before any of the prime nobility: By which it appears, that he preached, while dean of Durham 721, while bi&s;hop of Durham 550, and while archbi&s;hop of York to the time abovementioned 721, in all 1992 &s;ermons, and among&s;t them &s;everal extempore. This prelate certainly thought preaching to be the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible part of his duty; for in the diary before quoted, wherein, at the end of each year, he &s;ets down how many &s;ermons he had preach|ed, at the end of the year 1619, <HI>Sum. &s;er.</HI> 32, <HI>eheu!

He was con&s;ecrated by archbi&s;hop Hutton, by commi&s;&s;ion; but Le Neve &s;ays, he cannot find, either in his diary or el&s;ewhere, the time when, place where, or names of the bi&s;hops who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;olemnity. On his con&s;ecration he re&s;igned Bi&s;hopwearmouth. Upon his nomination to this bi&s;hopric, orders were given by the lord trea&s;urer to &s;ecure payment to the crown of 880 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum out of Allerton, and 140 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> out of Norham.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Peek's De&s;ider, Curio&s;a, lib. 5, 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During the time bi&s;hop Hutton held the See of Durham, he &s;uffered the queen to make two great innovations on the privileges of the bi&s;hopric; the one was, her nominating to the 12th prebendary in the cathedral church; and the other, her granting a charter of incorporation to Hartlepool: But of the&s;e matters more hereafter. King James made a like attempt, in this prelate's time, to incharter the city of Durham; but the bi&s;hop in&s;tituted a &s;uit in the exchequer, and by the decree made therein, the king's charter was &s;et a&s;ide<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dyer, p. 289.</NOTE>; and the prelate granted one, by which the city was put under the government of a mayor and twelve al|dermen. It was a &s;ingular mark of his benevolence, to give &s;o ample a charter, after having a tedious and expen&s;ive &s;uit with the burge&s;&s;es, who maintained the royal charter again&s;t his franchi&s;e<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Browne Willis, in his Notitia Parliamentaria, vol. ii. p. 523, &s;ays, "The city of Durham was govern|ed by an alderman and twelve burge&s;&s;es till the time of bi&s;hop Matthew, who changed the name of alderman into that of mayor, and burge&s;&s;es into that of aldermen."&mdash;Le Neve, p. 110.

But neither were they &s;o im|pudent as to crave, nor the king &s;o impotent as to give a whole bi&s;hoprie at once. e&s;pecially &s;o rich a bi|&s;hopric as this of Durham. But the truth is, that George Hume earl of Dunbar, lord-trea&s;urer of Scotland, and highly favoured by the king, having procured a grant of all the batable grounds, as they then called them, upon the borders of both kingdoms, began to ea&s;t his eye upon Norham ea&s;tle, and the lands about it belonging to the See of Durham, conceiving it a fit place to command all the re&s;t: But being a well-prin|cipled man, and a great mini&s;ter of that king, in re&s;toring the epi&s;copal government to the church of Scot|land, he acquainted bi&s;hop Bancro&s;t, with his de&s;ires, who, knowing what great u&s;e might be made of him for the good of his church, and being &s;ure enough of the con&s;ent of Dr Matthew then bi&s;hop of Dur|ham, he thus ordered the buline&s;s.

Thirdly, that in con&s;ideration hereof, bi&s;hop Matthew &s;hould make a grant of Nor|ham ca&s;tle, and the country adjoining, in fee farm to the king, by him immediately to be conveyed to the earl of Dunbar. And fourthly, that his own turn being thus &s;erved, the &s;aid earl &s;hould join with bi&s;hop Bancroft and his friends, for obtaining from the king an act of parliament, whereby both he and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould be made incapable of any of the like grants and alienations for the time to come; which, as it was the be&s;t market that ever Toby Matthew was at, &s;o was it the be&s;t bargain which was ever driven for the church of England: So far from &s;wallowing up that bi&s;hopric, that it was the only means to &s;ave that, and pre&s;erve the re&s;t.&mdash;Dr Heylin's Examen Hi&s;toricum, 8vo.

He and bi&s;hop Laud were the heads of the opponents to the puritans, and found means &s;o far to win upon the confidence of the &s;overeign, as to have the di&s;po&s;al of the church preferments. In the life of bi&s;hop Andrews is the following relation: <Q>There is a plea&s;ant &s;tory related of &startq;him (bi&s;hop Andrews) while he was bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, which was told by Mr Waller the poet to his &s;on-in-law Dr Birch. Waller going to &s;ee king James at dinner, on the day on which the parliament had been di&s;&s;olved, over|heard a very extraordinary conver&s;ation between his maje&s;ty, bi&s;hop Andrews, and Dr Neile bi&s;hop of Durham. The&s;e two prelates &s;tanding behind the king's chair, James a&s;ked them, 'My lords (&s;aid he) cannot I take my &s;ubjects money when I want it, without all this formality in parliament?' The bi&s;hop of Dur|ham, who was a complete court &s;ycophant, readily an&s;wered, 'God forbid, &s;ire, but you &s;hould; you are the breath of our no&s;trils.' Whereupon the king turned, and &s;aid to the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, 'Well, my lord, what &s;ay you?' 'Sir,' replied the bi&s;hop, 'I have no &s;kill to judge of parliamentary ca&s;es.' The king an&s;wered, 'No put-offs, my lord; an&s;wer me pre&s;ently.' 'Then, Sir,' &s;aid bi&s;hop Andrews, 'I think it lawful for you to take my brother Neile's mo|ney, for he offers it.' Mr Waller &s;aid, the company was much plea&s;ed with this an&s;wer, but the king &s;eemed particularly &s;truck with the wit of it; for a certain lord coming in &s;oon after, his maje&s;ty cried out, 'Oh, my lord, they &s;ay you <HI>lig</HI> with my lady.' 'No, Sir,' &s;aid his lord&s;hip, in &s;ome confu&s;ion, 'but I like her company, becau&s;e &s;he has &s;o much wit.'

<P>In the year 1613, bi&s;hop Neile was on that famous inqui&s;ition relative to the di|vorce of Robert earl of E&s;&s;ex and the lady Frances Howard his wife, and was one of the four bi&s;hops that certified therein<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Declaration, That Robert earl of E&s;&s;ex and the lady Francis Howard, contracted by &s;hew of marriage, did cohabit in one hou&s;e, and lie together in one bed <HI>mudus cum nuda et &s;olus cum &s;ola,</HI> and that the &s;aid lady Frances did &s;hew her&s;elf prompt and ready to be known of him, but that the &s;aid earl neither did nor could have knowledge of her; and that the &s;aid lady Frances, by in&s;pection of her body, was proved to be apt for carnal copulation with man, and yet was a virgin: And therefore we the &s;aid judges deputed in the cau&s;e, fir&s;t invoking the name of Chri&s;t, and &s;etting God before our eyes, do pronounce, decree, and de|clare the pretended marriage to be utterly void and of no effect; and that the &s;aid lady was and ought to be free and at liberty from any bond of &s;uch pretended marriage <HI>de facto</HI> between them: And that we do pronounce that &s;he ought to be divorced, and we do free and divorce her; leaving them, as touching other marriages, to their own con&s;ciences in the Lord.

The writer of the Life of James I.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Compl. Hi&s;t. of England, vol. ii. p. 729.</NOTE> under the year 1620, has the following remark on our prelate: Speaking of the king's &s;miling at a &s;atyrical &s;ermon preached before him by one of his own chaplains at Greenwich, chiefly pointed again&s;t the lord|trea&s;urer Cranfield, he thus proceeds: <Q>It &s;eems Neile the bi&s;hop of Lincoln was &startq;not by him then, for when any man preached that had the renown of piety, (un|willing the king &s;hould hear him) he would in the &s;ermon time entertain the king with a merry tale, (that I may give it no wor&s;e title) which the king would after laugh at, and tell tho&s;e near him, he could not hear the preacher for the old b&mdash; bi&s;hop. We mu&s;t confe&s;s this relation &s;mells too rank, but it was too true; and hope the mode&s;t reader will excu&s;e it, &s;eeing it proceeds not from any rancour again&s;t the prelacy, but to vindicate God's ju&s;tice to po&s;terity, who never pu|ni&s;hes without a cau&s;e; and &s;uch like practices as the&s;e were doubtle&s;s put upon the &s;core, which afterward gave a period to that hierarchy. This man's hand helped to clo&s;e up the counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex's virginity, when he was Coventry and Litchfield; his heart had this kind of vanity when he was Lincoln; and when he was archbi&s;hop of York his head was &s;o &s;illed with Arminian impiety, that in the next king's reign he was looked upon by the parliament to be one of the great grievances of the kingdom. His &s;o near attendance on the king's per&s;on was, by being ve&s;ted with the office of clerk of the clo&s;et to his maje&s;ty, in which he was continued when bi&s;hop of Durham, but the time of his fir&s;t admi&s;&s;ion to &endq;that place I have not yet found<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le Neve, p. 146.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ame year (1613) he was tran&s;lated to Lincoln, to which he was elected the 17th of January, confirmed the 18th of February, in&s;talled by proxy the 14th of May, and in per&s;on the 3d of Augu&s;t, 1614. In that year he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the con&s;ecration of Overal bi&s;hop of Litchfield; on the 6th of May 1615 he con&s;ecra|ted the new chapel at the earl of Sali&s;bury's &s;eat, near Hatfield; in 1617 bi&s;hop Neile attended the king in his progre&s;s to Scotland, and on his return from thence was tran&s;lated to Durham. Dr Heylin, in his Life of Archbi&s;hop Laud, part I. p. 74, has the following paragraph relating to this tran&s;lation: <Q>But what&s;oever &startq;the king lo&s;t by the journey, I am &s;ure the bi&s;hop of Lincoln got well by it: For James bi&s;hop of Durham dying during the king's abode in Scotland, his maje&s;ty be&s;towed upon him that wealthy bi&s;hopric, one of the wealthie&s;t in reve|nues, but ab&s;olutely one of the greate&s;t in power and privileges. Into this bi|&s;hopric being canonically confirmed on the 9th of October 1617, he pre&s;ently &s;et him&s;elf on work to repair the palaces and hou&s;es belonging to it, which he had found in great decay; but he &s;o adorned and beautified them in a very &s;hort &s;pace, that they that &s;aw them could not think that they were the &s;ame. Three thou&s;and pounds he is affirmed by bi&s;hop Godwin to have di&s;bur&s;ed only on this account, having laid out before no le&s;s than a thou&s;and marks on the epi&s;copal

But that which gave him mo&s;t content was his palace of Durham-hou&s;e in the Strand, not only becau&s;e it afforded him convenient room for his retinue, but becau&s;e it was large enough to allow &s;ufficient quarters for Buckridge bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and Laud dean of Glouce&s;ter, which he enjoyed when he was bi&s;hop of St David's al&s;o; &s;ome other quarters were re&s;erved for his old &s;ervant Dr Lin&s;ell, and others for &s;uch learned men of his acquaintance as came from time to time to attend upon him; in&s;omuch as it pa&s;&s;ed commonly by the name of Durham College.

About this period the king i&s;&s;ued <HI>A book of toleration for &s;ports and recrea|tions on Sundays after evening prayer,</HI> enjoining all mini&s;ters to read the &s;ame under &s;evere penalties. This does not reflect much credit on our prelate, who then held his office of clerk of the clo&s;et<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pryn's Breviat of archbi&s;hop Laud, p. 6.</NOTE>, and at a time when the religious rules were held &s;o lax, as to encourage the way-&s;liding of many pro&s;elytes, and giving much oppor|tunity to the various &s;ectaries who &s;trove to divide religion into atoms<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The king's declaration 24th May, 1618.&mdash;"That for his good peoples lawfull recreations, his plea&s;ure was, that after the end of divine &s;ervice, they &s;hould not be di&s;turbd, letted, or di&s;courged from any law|full recreations; &s;uch as dancing either of men or women, archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or any &s;uch harmle&s;s recreations: Nor for having of May-games, Whit&s;un-ales, or Morrice-dances, and &s;etting up of May-poles, or other &s;ports therewith u&s;ed, &s;o as the &s;ame be had in due and convenient time, without impe|diment or let of divine &s;ervice: And that women &s;hould have leave to carry ru&s;hes to the church for the de|corating of it according to their old cu&s;tom; withal prohibiting all unlawful games to be u&s;ed on the Sundays only, as bear-bating, bull-bating, and (at all times in the meaner &s;ort of people by law prohibited) bowl|ing."

No doubt his cafe would have been as bad as archbi&s;hop Laud's, had he lived long enough; but he was hap|pily called away before the flame broke out, dying at York, in the min&s;ter-yard, in the hou&s;e belonging to the prebend of Stillington, 15th Oct. 1640.&mdash;Hi&s;t.

Whil&s;t bi&s;hop of Durham, he brought many to conformity. He &s;pared not any that refu&s;ed the oath of allegiance, but put many into the <HI>praemunire</HI> for refu&s;ing it. Another time he cau&s;ed all the mini&s;ters, church-wardens, &amp;c. to pre&s;ent all recu&s;ants. As to the communion-table of &s;tone, &s;et up at Durham, it was &s;et up by the dean, without his privity, but he did not think it a matter worth ven|turing a jar upon removing it. As to the que&s;tions (of Arminiani&s;m, as after &s;tiled) he never meddled with them but once, when Dr Baro, at Cambridge, being que&s;tioned by &s;ome of the heads, wrote a di&s;cour&s;e to the &s;aid lord Burgh|ley, chancellor, to ju&s;tify him&s;elf; which di&s;cour&s;e he read, and finding him of opinion that God did elect <HI>propter praevi&s;am &s;idem,</HI> he wrote about a &s;heet, and maintained, that <HI>Qui de&s;tinavit finem, di&s;ponit de omnibus mediis ad finem conducen|tibus;</HI> and that faith, &amp;c. were <HI>effectus,</HI> not <HI>cau&s;ae electionis.</HI> As to the pardons, two of them he owns to have had a hand in; the other two, viz. the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter's and Dr Mainwaring's, were never &s;ent to him, nor did he know who got his maje&s;ty's hand to them; but owns that he &s;hould have been con|&s;enting. As to &s;tanding at the <HI>Gloria Patri,</HI> &amp;c. though there be no public con&s;titution enjoining it, yet he held it a duty well becoming all Chri&s;tians; and &endq;in &s;ome particular churches, as at Wells, it is by their local &s;tatutes required.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1631, he was tran&s;lated to the See of York; the only in&s;tance, Le Neve ob&s;erves, of one man's pa&s;&s;ing through &s;ix bi&s;hoprics. He &s;at in this la&s;t change nine years, <Q>and had the good fortune to live in peaceable, happy times, &startq;and to be taken hence ju&s;t before the beginning of the times of rebellion and villainy.

A &s;ermon, preached by Dr Sibthorpe at Northampton a&s;&s;izes, wherein the royal prerogative was uncon&s;titutionally held forth, was pre&s;ented by the king's au|thority to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to be licen&s;ed for publication &Dagger;, which he refu&s;ed.

The inhabitants of Cawood, by tra|dition, &s;hew the hou&s;e where he was born, and tell us, that his mother was a beggar woman, who travel|ling with her &s;on George to Lincoln, &s;eemed to follow her occupation in that city and the adjacent vil|lages; but the lad carrying the bag, and one time eating more than what his mother was willing to allow, ran away from her, fearing a &s;evere correction; when, coming to a gentleman's hou&s;e in the neighbourhood of Cawood, he took compa&s;&s;ion on him, fir&s;t ordered him to attend his kitchen, and perceiving his bright parts, gave him an equal education with his &s;on, which put him in the road to eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferment. In proce&s;s of time he became bi&s;hop of Lincoln, and made enquiry for his mother, who happening to open a gate through which his lord&s;hip was to pa&s;s to that city, recogni&s;ed and tenderly embraced her, and or|dered, that care &s;hould be taken of her during life.

<P>In Barwick's Life of this prelate, we are told, <Q>That his coat of arms and pe|digree &startq;&s;hew him to be of the &s;ame original and &s;tock with that eminent prelate and &s;tate&s;man John Morton, bi&s;hop of Ely and lord chancellor of England, afterward archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and cardinal in the reign of Henry VII. by who&s;e management the two hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter were united: From whence it may be concluded, his ance&s;tors could not be ob&s;cure, at lea&s;t &s;ince this cardinal's time; for &s;uch per&s;ons as he &s;eldom left their kindred without con&s;iderable preferments. Undoubtedly he was de&s;cended from Thomas or John Morton, whom the cardinal made his heirs, as being &s;ons to two of his brothers. Certain it is, that Sir Thomas Morton of Dor&s;et&s;hire, who reckoned his de&s;cent from one of them, &s;ought out our prelate, acknowledged his kin|dred, &endq;and de&s;ired his acquaintance.</Q> He was the &s;ixth of nineteen children of Mr Richard Morton, mercer and alderman of York, by Elizabeth Leedale, his
<PB N="496" REF="552">only wife. Barwick &s;ays, <Q>She was a gentlewoman of a very good family, de|&s;cended &startq;from the Valva&s;ors by the mother's &s;ide, and not only the Valva&s;ors, but the Langdales al&s;o; and other gentlemen of eminent worth in York&s;hire &endq;acknowledged them&s;elves to be of his kindred.</Q> He was born in York on the 20th of March, 1564; educated fir&s;t in that city, and afterwards at Halifax: In the year 1582 he was &s;ent to St John's college, Cambridge, and put under the tuition of Mr Anthony Higgins, long after dean of Ripon, and a good benefactor to the college; who, quitting the univer&s;ity for church preferment, left Mr Mor|ton under the care of Henry Nel&s;on, afterwards rector of Hougham in Lincoln&s;hire, who lived to &s;ee his pupil advanced to the See of Durham, and many years after. In the beginning of November, 1584, he was elected &s;cholar of the hou&s;e, into a place of Con&s;table's foundation, peculiar to his own native county of York: In 1586 took the degree of bachelor of arts, and that of ma&s;ter in 1590, having performed all exerci&s;es requi&s;ite for each degree with great applau&s;e. He continu|ed his &s;tudies in the college, at his father's charge, about two years after he was made ma&s;ter of arts; and on the 17th of March, 1592, was admitted fellow into a place of Dr Keyton's foundation, merely on account of his merit, again&s;t eight competitors: About the &s;ame time he was cho&s;en logic-lecturer for the univer&s;ity, which office he di&s;charged with great ability and diligence, as appears by his lec|tures fairly written, which were found among his papers, after his decea&s;e: In the &s;ame year, 1592, he was ordained deacon, and the year following prie&s;t, by Dr Howland, bi&s;hop of Peterborough: For about five years after this he continu|ed in the college, pro&s;ecuting his private &s;tudies, and in&s;tructing his pupils: He took the degree of bachelor of divinity in 1598, and about the &s;ame time ob|tained the rectory of Long Mar&s;ton near York, which was procured for him by his father. But his great parts and worth would not &s;uffer him to lie hid in a country cure; for the earl of Huntingdon, lord pre&s;ident of the council of the north, &s;oon made him his chaplain, on account of his acute di&s;putations with the Romi&s;h recu&s;ants; queen Elizabeth having given expre&s;s command to the earl, to convince them by arguments, rather than &s;uppre&s;s them by force, expre&s;&s;ing upon this occa&s;ion <HI>nolo mortem peccatoris.</HI> Upon the death of the earl, Morton returned again to his privacy at Mar&s;ton, where he continued no long time before the lord Sheffield, who &s;ucceeded as lord pre&s;ident, commanded him to hold a public conference, before his lord&s;hip and the council at his manor hou&s;e at York, with two Romi&s;h recu&s;ants, then pri&s;oners in the ca&s;tle, which he performed to the great &s;atisfaction of his numerous auditors. In 1602, the plague raging violently at York, he behaved him&s;elf with uncommon courage and great charity towards the poor, &s;ick, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: The infected of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s being turned out of the city, had booths erected on Hobmoor, to whom he often repaired from Mar&s;|ton, to preach and mini&s;ter con&s;olation to their langui&s;hing &s;ouls: To relieve the poore&s;t, he carried meat in &s;acks; but as often as he went thither, he &s;uffered no &s;ervant to attend him, &s;addled and un&s;addled his own hor&s;e, and had a private door made through the wall of his &s;tudy, which was in the mo&s;t di&s;tant part of his hou&s;e, le&s;t infection &s;hould be brought to his family. In the &s;ame or the fol|lowing
<PB N="497" REF="553">year, Ralph lord Eure being appointed by the queen amba&s;&s;ador extra|ordinary to the emperor of Germany and the king of Denmark, took him for his chaplain, together with one Richard Crakenthorp, another very learned per&s;on, a native of Strickland in We&s;tmorland: Morton, de&s;irous of improvement by &s;eeing foreign countries, readily accepted the employment. Whil&s;t the amba&s;&s;ador &s;taid at Bremen, he obtained leave to vi&s;it &s;ome of the chief cities and univer&s;i|ties in Germany, which introduced him to the knowledge and acquaintance of &s;everal learned men. His &s;tay in tho&s;e parts was the &s;horter, becau&s;e the am|ba&s;&s;ador's commi&s;&s;ion determined with the death of the queen: However, he im|proved his time &s;o well, partly in furni&s;hing his own library with books at Frank|fort and el&s;ewhere, but chiefly in his conver&s;ation with learned men, and the ob&s;er|vations he made, that he always highly valued that opportunity. At his return he was appointed chaplain to Roger earl of Rutland, which appointment he liked, not only for the &s;ake of the privacy, but al&s;o becau&s;e it brought him &s;o much nearer London than his former &s;tation. In 1606 he took the degree of doc|tor in divinity, which brought him to the acquaintance of Dr John Overall, re|gius profe&s;&s;or at Cambridge: About the &s;ame time he was &s;worn chaplain in ordinary to James I. and by him pre&s;ented to the deanry of Glouce&s;ter the 22d of June, 1607, through archbi&s;hop Bancroft's recommendation: Whil&s;t he held that deanry, the lord Eure, then lord pre&s;ident of Wales, nominated him one of his maje&s;ty's council for the marches: On the 12th of July, 1606, he was in|corporated doctor of divinity in Oxford: After continuing about three years dean of Glouce&s;ter, he was removed to the deanry of Winche&s;ter, into which he was in|&s;talled the 3d of June, 1609; and Dr Bil&s;on then bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter collated him to the rectory of Alresford: About the &s;ame time, Dr Sutcliffe, dean of Exeter, found|ed a college at Chel&s;ea, for a certain number of divines, to be employed in an&s;wer|ing the books di&s;per&s;ed by popi&s;h emi&s;&s;aries; of which our learned doctor was ap|pointed a fellow. On the 21&s;t of July, 1610, archbi&s;hop Matthew made him a pre|bendary in the church of York: The &s;ame year he preached a &s;ermon before the convocation at St Paul's, on Matt. v. 13; and was to have been cho&s;en prolocutor of the lower hou&s;e, had he not declined it to make room for a friend. The&s;e, and the like public employments bringing him frequently to London, he lodged at the deanry-hou&s;e of St Paul's, upon the invitation of Dr Overall, then dean of that church; where he became acquainted with the learned I&s;aac Ca&s;aubon, who was entertained and patroni&s;ed by the &s;ame worthy dean; and it was at Dr Morton's charge that a monument was erected in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey to Ca&s;aubon's me|mory. In the beginning of the year 1616, our learned doctor was nominated bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, and con&s;ecrated the 7th of July that year.

<P>A. D. 1635. By an order made by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the archbi&s;hop of York, the lord keeper, the lord privy &s;eal, the lord Cottington, and the two &s;ecretaries of &s;tate (upon a reference to them by his ma|je&s;ty upon bi&s;hop Morton's petition) on hearing coun&s;el for the king and the bi&s;hop, and after advi&s;ing with the two lords chief ju&s;tices, the lord chief baron, and ju&s;tice Hutton, it is reported, that the county of Dur|ham appeared to be a county palatine by pre&s;cription, and the bi&s;hop appointed the &s;heriffs.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, that the &s;heriff never was an attendant upon the courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter, nor returned any writs thi|ther, he not being an immediate officer to tho&s;e courts, but had only mandates from the bi&s;hop's chancery at Durham to execute the king's proce&s;&s;e, and &s;o returned the mandate back to the &s;ame chancery, and then the bi&s;hop returned the original proce&s;&s;e into the courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter, they being directed only to the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>And by the &s;tat. 27 Hen. VIII. cap. 24, tho&s;e mandates are directed and warranted.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, by the &s;tatute 31 Eliz. cap. 9, the bi&s;hop is to have a deputy (and not the &s;heriff) in the courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>And it was further reported, that to oblige the &s;heriff to attend in the exchequer, would be an in&s;upport|able charge, and would di&s;courage all men from taking the office of &s;heriff, the bi&s;hop not having any means to compell them to it, and thereby the liberties of the See would be lo&s;t and infringed. Wherefore the bi|&s;hop and &s;heriff were freed from accounting or attending in the exchequer; but to account before the king's auditor for that county, and he to have a commi&s;&s;ioner for taking the oath thereupon, and the charge, and the bi&s;hop to pay the &s;ees of a mini&s;terial account.</P>
<P>Which order was confirmed at the council board, and in the &s;tar-chamber and exchequer, and is enrolled there, Trinity, 1637.</P>
<P>And the practice hath gone accordingly ever &s;ince, and the &s;heriff was never appo&s;ed, either upon his ac|count or returns, but they have been con&s;tantly allowed upon his general oath of office, and the oath upon his accounts. And the officers cannot produce one precedent again&s;t the &s;heriff of Durham, &s;ave in the late times when the county palatine was di&s;&s;olved. And Mr Clement of the trea&s;urer remembrancer's office, and Mr Burnet of the pipe, have both certified for the &s;heriff, that he hath been con&s;tantly cleared from his appo&s;als in both the&s;e &s;ides, and only the king's remembrancer's &s;ide pre&s;s for it.</P>
<P>A. D. 1662. By a privy &s;eal, all this privilege and exemption is allowed and confirmed, and the &s;heriff is declared to be the bi&s;hop's officer, and only accountable to him, and therefore Sir Tho.

<P>The &s;tat. 14 Cha.

<P>We have now approached the aera of tho&s;e civil broils, which filled the &s;tate with di&s;traction under the reign of Charles I. the calamities of which times great|ly affected this palatinate. The political and religious principles which were agi|tated by the contending parties are well known to every Engli&s;h reader. A war with Scotland took place. Part of the Engli&s;h forces were drawn down to the frontiers, under the command of lord Conway, general of the hor&s;e; whil&s;t the main body of the army was encamped near York. The earl of Northumberland, who was to command under the king, remained &s;ick at London; and the earl of Strafford, lieutenant-general, being a nece&s;&s;ary member of the king's &s;ecret coun|cil, could not be ab&s;ent from his maje&s;ty. Lord Conway advanced to Newca&s;tle with an army of 3000 foot and 1500 hor&s;e; and there received intelligence, that the Scots, 22,000 &s;trong, were preparing to enter England, under the command of Le&s;ley: They pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed on the 20th of Augu&s;t, 1640, the very day the king &s;et out from London; and marched to Newburn, on the banks of the Tyne, oppo&s;ite to which place lord Conway had po&s;ted his troops, and thrown up lines and brea&s;tworks to command the ford. A &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued, for it could not be called a battle, and the Scotch army gained the pa&s;s. Lord Conway retreated precipitately through Durham, and joined the royal army; leaving Newca&s;tle, with all the &s;tores the king had collected there for the compaign, to the hands of the enemy. A panic &s;eized the whole country. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Newca&s;tle, the Scots pre&s;ented a new memorial to the crown, full of moderation and temperance; and &s;ent di&s;patches to the Londoners, to a&s;&s;ure them the &s;upply of coals &s;hould not be ob&s;tructed. A negociation &s;peedily took place, and the commi&s;&s;ioners met at Ri|pon, where certain articles were agreed upon, as preliminary to a treaty; among which was a provi&s;ion for the maintenance of the Scotch troops, which had &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed heretofore in violence, by foraging and contributions rai&s;ed in Cumberland, Newca&s;tle, and Durham.

<P>The bi&s;hop remained a very &s;hort time in York&s;hire, taking his journey to Lon|don, where, as he went to We&s;tmin&s;ter to attend in parliament, he was near being torn in pieces by the mob; &s;ome crying out to pull him from his coach; others oppo&s;ed, &s;aying, "he was a good man;" to which it was immediately replied, "but he is a bi&s;hop." He often declared afterwards that he believed he &s;hould not have e&s;caped, had not a leading man in the tumult exclaimed, "let him go and hang him&s;elf," which diverted the inveterate purpo&s;e of the rioters.

The&s;e auxiliaries came to the parliament doors in great bodies; and cried "No bi&s;hops." And for a further reinforcement, pe|titions to the hou&s;es came up from &s;everal counties, &s;etting forth, that the bi&s;hops were a common nui&s;ance; that the decay of trade, the clogging and di&s;appoint|ing of all bu&s;ine&s;s in parliament, was occa&s;ioned by the bi&s;hops. From thence they advanced to downright railing and in&s;ulting their per&s;ons, and throwing &s;tones at them, &s;o that they could not come to the lords' hou&s;e, either by land or &endq;water, without apparent hazard of their lives.</Q> One author has the following remark on the calamities which at this time afflicted the county of Durham: <Q>&startq;As the fir&s;t popi&s;h innovations and &s;uper&s;titions, which lately over&s;pread our whole church, had their original from bi&s;hop Neile and his chaplain Dr Co&s;ins, at Durham; &s;o God hath made that city and bi&s;hopricke of Durham (the only county of England &s;tiled by the name of a bi&s;hopricke) the &s;eate of our late war, wherein the Scotti&s;h armie now re&s;ides; to manife&s;t to all the world, that the&s;e unhappie civill warres &s;prung from the bi&s;hops, &s;ince the &s;eat of them is no where but in this bi&s;hopricke; the Scotti&s;h general for the mo&s;t parte hath kept his re&s;idence in the bi&s;hop of Durham's own palaces, who for fear hath left them &endq;vacant, and fled that country, which he hath much oppre&s;&s;ed.</Q> Such were the illiberal cen&s;ures thrown out by the bigots of the times, who had reformed all re|ligion into a drow&s;y vi&s;ion.</P>

The marquis of Newca&s;tle, who com|manded for the king in the norht, arrived at Newca&s;tle on the 2d of February, with a few troops, not &s;ufficient in number to oppo&s;e the invaders in the open field.

Being turned out of Durham-Hou&s;e by the &s;oldiers when they came to garri&s;on it, about the end of the year 1648, the earl and counte&s;s of Rutland invited him to Exeter-Hou&s;e in the Strand, where he became a part of their care and family for &s;ome &s;hort time. But being loth to live at the charge of others while he was able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t of him&s;elf, and thinking the country air might better &s;uit with his declining years than that of the city, he went and lived with captain Thomas Saunders at Flam&s;tead in Hertford&s;hire, and afterwards with Tho|mas Rotheram, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Luton, in Bedford&s;hire. At la&s;t, going to London with about &s;ixty pounds, which it &s;eems was then his all, he was overtaken on the road by Sir Chri&s;topher Yelverton, who, being known to the bi&s;hop, though the bi&s;hop was un|known to him, fell into di&s;cour&s;e with him, and a&s;ked him who he was? The bi&s;hop replied, "I am that old man the bi&s;hop of Durham, notwith&s;tanding all your votes;" (for Sir Chri&s;topher had too much complied with the times.) Whereupon Sir Chri|&s;topher a&s;ked whither he was going? "To London," replied the good old bi&s;hop, "to live a little while, and then to die." On this Sir Chri&s;topher entered into further di&s;cour&s;e with him, and took him home to his hou&s;e at Ea&s;ton Manduit, in Northampton&s;hire, where he became tutor to his &s;on, afterwards the very learned Sir Henry Yelverton. On the death of Sir Chri&s;topher, his &s;on Sir Henry, who had the affection of a mo&s;t tender child for the good bi&s;hop, continued to &s;upport him till his death, which happened on the 22d of September 1659, in the 95th year of his age, the 44th &s;ince his being con&s;ecrated a bi&s;hop, and the 28th of his tran|&s;lation to the See of Durham.</P>

<P>"The humble and harty acknowledgments of many hone&s;t people in the county of Durham, declaring as followeth:</P>
<P>"WEE receiving a declaration from his Excellency and you the 26th. of this In&s;tant Aprill; upon the reading whereof, we were at fir&s;t like men in a dreame,
<PB N="517" REF="573">and could hardly beleeve for rejoyceing, to &s;ee the wonderfull goodnes and kinde|ne&s;s of God, in renueing a remembrance of your former engagements for this poore nation, who&s;e freedome the Lord hath made you in&s;truments to purcha&s;e at &s;o deere a rate, from that &s;laverie and bondage they were formerly involved in; all which God hath beene wonderfully plea&s;ed to crowne, not with ordinary &s;ucce&s;&s;e, but with almo&s;t miraculous di&s;coveryes of his pre&s;ence with you, to the great &s;atis|faction of all hone&s;t godly harts, and to the conviction of others, forcing them to &s;ay for a truth, God is there. We need not mention the particulers, wherein God hath &s;o wonderfully appeared, it being &s;oe obvious to all mens eyes; and this la&s;t act is not the lea&s;t to di&s;cover the continuation of the Lords pre&s;ence with your hearts, in moveing you to de&s;olve this pre&s;ent parliament, who&s;e actions, in the&s;e latter dayes, were &s;o contrarie to their own declarations and the armye's engage|ment, that wee did almo&s;t begin to conclude that our oppre&s;&s;ions would be as great as ever; and though the &s;ence of our unkindnes to God cau&s;es us to con|clude it is ju&s;t from him, yet wee thought it very &s;trange from them. And that which did very much add to our &s;orrow, was the feare of Gods pre&s;ence with|drawing from you, which feare was cau&s;ed by your long &s;ilence; but now to &s;ee the Lord hath againe quickened you, is as life to our dying expectations, and doth exceedingly engage our hearts, as to acknowledge God in you, &s;oe to continue &s;eeking the Lord for you, that you may not &s;tay nor bee di&s;couraged in the great worke you have in hand, but that you may goe on as in&s;truments to perfect the freedome of the poore people in this nation. And for that end wee doe earne&s;tly be&s;eech the Lord, that you may be kept low in your&s;elves, and that neither your former glorious victories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es, nor the eminent imployment that God hath now put you upon, may any way take you off from a &s;ingular looking upon God in it, nor any oppo&s;itions (which we feare may be many) may di&s;courage you in the pro&s;ecution of what is begun, but that you may &s;till goe on in the worke, as God's worke; and be confident it is hone&s;ty God will owne, and make honour|able in the&s;e dayes.

A glorious in&s;trument in Gods hand of the like effects in this common|wealth was your Highne&s;s renowned father, who as well de&s;erved the &s;irname of Augu&s;tus as the former: For who more increa&s;ed with admirable internal endow|ments
<PB N="529" REF="585">and external honors? or who more &s;uccesful to make up the ruines, and increa&s;e the well being of a broken &s;tate than HE? In whom the warlike prowe&s;s of our Fift Henry, and the prudence of our Seventh Henry, and the piety of our Sixt Edward were happily conjoin'd, on whom was ful&s;ill'd the ancient wi&s;h of the Romans at the inauguration of their emperors, <HI>Sis Augu&s;to foelicior, &s;is Trajano m$|lior.</HI> As &s;oon as, by the good hand of God following him with unparallel'd &s;uc|ce&s;s, he had laid the &s;torm of our civil wars, he pre&s;ently &s;et his heart to endea|vour the repairing of the&s;e decayes which arms had made on learning; and this he did by affording all countenance and encouragement to our two famous univer|&s;ities. Al&s;o (con&s;idering that the&s;e northern counties, as they are too remote from the light&s;ome, warm and cheri&s;hing influences of the &s;un; &s;o are they from tho&s;e fountains of light, for the better propagating of learning &amp; religion in them) h$ &s;et his heart on a de&s;ign of erecting a college in this city of Durham; which with mature advice of his council, he effected by patent under his great &s;eal, &s;ound|ing a college here, &amp; endowing it with &s;uch a proportion of revenue as at the pre|&s;ent he could conveniently di&s;po&s;e of to &s;uch a u&s;e, and &s;uch privileges as were needful to &s;uch a &s;ociety. The public concernment of the work, together with his Highne&s;s zeal and re&s;olution for the effectual carrying it on, encouraged us, who were nominated thereto, to undertake the &s;ame; though we well knew what cen&s;ures we were like to meet with, &amp; what oppo&s;ition &amp; di&s;couraging difficultys, works of this kind at the fir&s;t beginning u&s;e to be encountred with. Scarcely were we &s;et down there, but it plea&s;ed the wi&s;e God to remove his Highne&s;s from an earthly &s;ceptre to an heavenly crown &amp; glory: Whereon this new erection was left an orphan &s;carce bound up in its &s;waddling cloaths; but the Lord having placed your Highne&s;s in your father's &s;eat, as &s;upreme magi&s;trate of this common|wealth, for the continuance of that happy peace and liberty, which under God, owes it&s;elf to that admirable valor, wi&s;dom, and &s;ucce&s;s which was in him; we do humbly, with much confidence, promi&s;e to our&s;elves, that your Highne&s;s will rea|dily both cheri&s;h and promote that work, which out of his de&s;ire of the good of the&s;e parts, your excellent father gave a laudable beginning to: That &s;o that col|lege may remain as a monument of his love of learning no le&s;s perpetual, than tho&s;e many trophies of his victorious military abilities. We, with all the pious and peaceful members of this commonwealth, do ble&s;s our gracious God, for his providing for the continuance of our peace and liberties, by &s;etting your Highne&s;s in your father's throne, &amp; do &s;ay with Haram in the ca&s;e of Solomon, <HI>Ble&s;t be the Lord this day, which hath given our late renowned protector a wi&s;e &s;on over this great people, and becau&s;e the Lord loved his people, hath he done this thing;</HI> be&s;eech|ing the Father of Mercies to make your Highne&s;s as heir to all your fathers matchle&s;s abilities for war and government, &s;o of his love, zeal and re&s;olution to promote this work which he began in this place; that by the vital beams of your piteous a&s;pect, it may be cheri&s;hed and grow, 'till it bear much fruit, for the good &amp; happine&s;s of the&s;e parts in the land, in which it was planted by a hand which never mi&s;carried in any of its high and magnanimous atchievements; So pray</P>

<P>Bi&s;hop Morton is de&s;cribed to have been low in &s;tature, clean-limbed, of a &s;trong body, excellent con&s;titution, con&s;tant and uninterrupted health, and of a comely and affable countenance. Even in his old-age, his carriage was upright, his actions &s;prightly, his hearing quick, his voice clear, his body firm and full of moi&s;ture, &s;o that no phy&s;ician in the world would have believed him near the age he was, if, in con&s;idering his per&s;on, he had not regarded the remarkable whitene&s;s of his hair. He was of a quick wit, &s;olid judgment, and retentive memory: As he was a man
<PB N="531" REF="587">of great erudition, &s;o was he al&s;o extremely &s;tudious and diligent, and was never idle without being unhappy: He was often at his devotion and &s;tudy before four in the morning, even when above eighty years of age, &s;eldom went to bed till af|ter ten, and then had a &s;ervant to read to him till he wi&s;hed for repo&s;e; he had al&s;o one to read to him in his coach as he travelled, &s;o anxious was he that his mind &s;hould not lo&s;e a moment's in&s;truction. Of his moral qualifications the account is equally favourable: He was a man of exemplary piety, temperance, &s;obriety, and great ho&s;pitality. Dr Barwick &s;ays, "his conver&s;ation was &s;uch, for piety and de|votion, as well became a Chri&s;tian and a bi&s;hop." He never would endure a &s;oft bed, but laid upon a &s;traw mattra&s;s, even when above four&s;core, till his in|firmities obliged him to change it: His &s;tudy gown was &s;ometimes of a coar&s;e, black, hairy rug; and he &s;eldom exceeded one meal a day, which was &s;upper in his middle age, and dinner in the decline of life: Wine or &s;trong drink he &s;eldom ever ta&s;ted; for his health being good, and his bodily infirmities trivial, ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s contributed much to the protection of his con&s;titution: He was never married, yet lived an irreproachable life, even in youth; and, full of good works, piety, virtue, dignity of manners, and full of days, he met his approaching di&s;&s;olution with religi|ous peace and holy faith. He was buried the 29th of September, in the chancel of the church of Ea&s;t-Manduit, Northampton&s;hire, where a monument was after|wards erected to his memory, with an epitaph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>In memori&acirc; &s;acr&acirc;</L>

The re&s;t, deducting &s;ome &s;mall remembrances, he ordered for his burial, which, though not &endq;much above 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> was &s;o well hu&s;banded as to have a &s;mall remnant for a monument at his own charge.</Q> &mdash;Barwick, p. 126.</P></NOTE> compo&s;ed by Dr Barwick, who admini&s;tred to him in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, and preached a funeral &s;ermon at his exe|quies, which were attended with a great concour&s;e of the clergy and people.

Providence &s;oon &s;upplied the lo&s;s, and gave him a more munificent friend in Dr Richard Neile, then bi&s;hop of Durham, who took him for his dome&s;tic chaplain, and in 1624 appointed him to the tenth prebend in the cathedral there, into which he was in&s;talled the 4th of December in that year. All the time he enjoyed this prebend, which was about &s;ix and thirty years, he was con&s;tant in his re&s;idence, and kept an ho&s;pitality con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tatutes of that church; &s;o that Dr Ba&s;ire a&s;&s;erts, upon &s;earch of the regi&s;ter of that cathedral, he could not find one di&s;pen&s;ation for him in all the time he continued a prebendary. He was very attentive to the rights, privileges, and antiquities of the church, compared the repertorium with the original records, and marked what were wanting. In September, 1624, he was collated to the archdeaconry of the Ea&s;t-Riding in the church of York, vacant by the re&s;ignation of Marmaduke Blake&s;ton, who&s;e daughter he had married; and on the 20th of July, 1626, was collated by the bi&s;hop of Durham to the rectory of Brancepeth in that dioce&s;s, where he fir&s;t di&s;played his abundant ta&s;te for ornament and elegance, by beautifying that church in an extraordinary manner: The &s;ame year he took his degree of bachelor in divinity. About that time, having frequent meetings at the bi&s;hop of Durham's hou&s;e in London with Dr William Laud then bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, Dr Francis White &s;oon after bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, Dr Richard Mon|tague, and other learned men, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their zeal for the doctrine and di&s;cipline of the church of England, he began to be obnoxious to the puritans, who in the heat of &s;pirit regarded divines of Mr Co&s;in's ca&s;t as being affected to the Romi&s;h church. A book he publi&s;hed in 1627, entitled 'a Collection of Private Devotions,' met with their particular cen&s;ure.

<P>In 1628 he was concerned, with other members of the church of Durham, in a pro&s;ecution again&s;t Peter Smart, a prebendary there, for a &s;editious &s;ermon preach|ed in that cathedral<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smart, who had been a &s;choolma&s;ter at Durham, was collated 30th Dec. 1609, to the &s;ixth prebend in the church of Durham, and removed the 6th of July, 1614, to the fourth prebend; he had al&s;o other pre|ferments.

One author indeed (Fuller) calls him "a man of grave a&s;pect and reverend pre&s;ence;" but Co&s;in, who knew him better, &s;ays, "That he was an old man, of a mo&s;t froward, fierce, and unpeaceable &s;pirit."

And whil&s;t he held and enjoyed his preferment, and his health too, he &s;eldom preached more than once or twice a year.&mdash;Biog.

He &s;erved the office of vice-chancellor for the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, in 1640; and the &s;ame year, Charles I, to whom he was chaplain, conferred upon him the deanry of Pe|terborough, in which he was in&s;talled on the 7th of November: But he did not long enjoy that dignity; for, on the 10th of the &s;ame month, a petition from Smart was read in the hou&s;e of commons, wherein he complained of the doctor's &s;uper&s;ti|tion in innovations in the church at Durham, and of his &s;evere pro&s;ecution in the high commi&s;&s;ion court; whereupon, on the 21&s;t of the &s;ame month, Dr Co&s;in was ordered to be &s;ent for by the &s;erjeant at arms, and a committee was appointed to prepare a charge again&s;t him. Soon after, he pre&s;ented a petition to the hou&s;e, which, on the 28th following, was read and referred to a committee. On the 3d of December the &s;erjeant had leave given him by the commons to take bail for Dr Co&s;in, which was accordingly done, on the 19th of January, 1640-1, the doctor him&s;elf being bound in 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and his &s;ureties in 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> each, for his appearance upon &s;ummons.

Hence was he carried to the high commi&s;&s;ion at Lambeth; and after long trouble, remanded to York, fined 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> committed to pri&s;on, ordered to recant; and for neglect thereof, fined again, excommunicated, degraded, and deprived; his da|mage amounting to many thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>"But now Mr Rou&s;e of the hou&s;e of commons, bringing up the charge to the lords again&s;t Dr Co&s;in, termed Mr Smart the <HI>protomartyr of England in the&s;e latter days of per&s;ecution;</HI> and large reparations were allowed unto him, though he lived not long after to e$$oy them.</P>
<P>"Now, though none can excu&s;e and defend Dr Co&s;in his carriage herein, yet this mu&s;t be reported to his due commendation: Some years after, getting over into France he neither joined with the church of French prote&s;tants at Charentoun nigh Paris, nor kept any communion with the papi&s;ts therein, but confiled him|&s;elf to the church of old Engli&s;h prote&s;tants, &amp;c. &amp;c."</P></NOTE>. The doctor put in an an&s;wer, upon oath, to the &s;everal allegations, and &s;o fully vindi|cated him&s;elf, during the five days the affair was depending before the lords, that mo&s;t of them acknowledged his innocence; and Mr Glover, one of Smart's coun|&s;el, told him openly, at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords, "that he was a&s;hamed of him, and could not in con&s;cience plead for him any longer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was &s;uppo&s;ed there was a &s;ettled de&s;ign to introduce popery, and that &s;everal bi&s;hops and other clergymen were in the plot. The archbi&s;hop of Cantarbury, the bi&s;hops of Ely and of Bath and Wells, Dr Co&s;in, &s;ecretary Windebank, and &s;ome other, were accu&s;ed of being chiefly concerned in this affair, which was openly &s;aid to be managed by the queen and her con&s;idants. Though this charge was perhaps carried too far with re&s;pect to the private per&s;ons, it can hardly be denied that they gave &s;ome cau&s;e for it by their proceedings. Their hatred to the pre&s;byterians made them not &s;cruple to make too near ap|proaches to popery, in order to be at a greater di&s;tance from pre&s;byteriani&s;m. This, if I am not mi&s;|taken, was the true cau&s;e of all the innovations introduced into the public wor&s;hip, and of the inviolable attachment to the ob&s;ervance of certain indifferent or needle&s;s cu&s;toms and ceremonies.&mdash;Rapin, p. 364.</NOTE>;" on which the lords di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the doctor, upon his putting in bail for his appearance; but they never &s;ent for him again. About the &s;ame time, upon a motion made in the hou&s;e of commons, "That he had enticed a young &s;cholar to popery," he was committed to the &s;erjeant at arms, to attend daily till the hou&s;e &s;hould call him to a hearing: After fifty days impri&s;onment, and charges of twenty &s;hillings a day, he came at length to a hearing; when he made it appear, that, being vice-chancellor of Cam|bridge, he had mo&s;t &s;everely puni&s;hed that young &s;cholar, (whom upon examination he had found guilty) by making him recant, and expelling him the univer&s;ity; to which &s;everal of the members bore witne&s;s: However, the doctor had no manner of reparation made him for his great trouble and expence, a circum&s;tance which conveys no favourable idea of the ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty of that hou&s;e. In 1642 he was concerned, with others, in &s;ending the plate of Cambridge univer&s;ity to Cha. J, then at York, for which a furious &s;torm fell upon &s;everal members of the univer|&s;ity,
<PB N="536" REF="593">and particularly upon Dr Co&s;in, who having been &s;ome time before voted un|worthy to be a head or governor of either of the univer&s;ities, or to hold or enjoy any eccle&s;ia&s;tical promotion, was ejected from his ma&s;ter&s;hip by a warrant from the earl of Manche&s;ter, dated the 16th of March 1642-3; &s;o that, as he was the fir&s;t that was &s;eque&s;tered, &s;o was he al&s;o the fir&s;t of his univer&s;ity that was turned out. Thus, being deprived of all his preferments, and &s;till fearing the wor&s;t that might fol|low, he thought fit to leave the kingdom and withdrew to Paris, in the year 1643: Being &s;afely arrived there, according to king Charles's order and direction, he took under his care, and officiated as chaplain to &s;uch of queen Henrietta-Maria's hou&s;e|hold as were Prote&s;tants; with them, and other Engli&s;h exiles that were daily re&s;ort|ing to Paris, he formed a congregation, that a&s;&s;embled at fir&s;t in a private hou&s;e, and afterwards in the chapel of Sir Richard Brown, amba&s;&s;ador from the court of England to that of France. Not long after he had lodgings a&s;&s;igned him in the Louvre, with a &s;mall pen&s;ion, on account of the relation he bore to queen Henri|etta. During his re&s;idence in this place, he &s;hewed how fal&s;e and groundle&s;s the imputation was that had been thrown upon him, of being inclined to the Romi&s;h church; for, notwith&s;tanding the difficulties of his &s;ituation, he remained &s;teady and unmoved in the profe&s;&s;ion of his religion; he kept up the Engli&s;h church di&s;ci|pline, and the form of wor&s;hip appointed by the Common-prayer; he reclaimed &s;e|veral that were wavering in their principles, and had many controver&s;ies and di&s;|putes with the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of the country, particularly with the prior of the Engli&s;h Benedictines in Paris, in which he acquitted him&s;elf with &s;o much learning and &s;ound rea&s;oning, that he utterly defeated the &s;u&s;picions of his enemies, and much exceed|ed the expectations of his friends. "Great offers of preferment were made him," Nel&s;on &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 519.</NOTE>, "if he could have been tempted to have &s;werved in his religion." He compo&s;ed, during his exile, many learned works, which Dr Ba&s;ire particularly mentions. Though he was extremely zealous for the doctrine and di&s;cipline of the church of England, yet he continued a friendly intercour&s;e and corre&s;pondence with the Prote&s;tant mini&s;ters at Charenton, who on their parts expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t re|gard for him; and permitted him &s;ometimes to officiate in their congregations, ac|cording to the rites pre&s;cribed by the book of Common-prayer. Thus having, during his &s;eventeen years exile in France, behaved di&s;creetly and prudently, even in the judgment of his enemies, he returned to his native country at the re&s;toration of Charles II, and again took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his preferments and dignities. About the end of July 1660, he came to his deanry at Peterborough, and was the fir&s;t that read the Common-prayer in that cathedral after the times of confu&s;ion. But here he was not &s;uffered to re&s;t; for the king de&s;igned, a very little while after, to make him dean of Durham; but, reflecting on his &s;ufferings, and his con&s;tant at|tendance and &s;ervices beyond the &s;eas, he nominated him bi&s;hop of that rich See: Accordingly he was con&s;ecrated on the 2d of December, 1660, in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey. As &s;oon as he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dioce&s;e, he &s;et about reforming many abu&s;es that had crept in during the late anarchy, and by his generous and ho&s;pitable temper, accompanied with a kind and courteous deportment, he gained an univer&s;al re&s;pect and e&s;teem. He was appointed by the convocation to draw up a new book of canons.</P>
<P>Charles II. had a de&s;ign of honouring &s;everal of the gentlemen of this dioce&s;e,
<PB N="537" REF="594">among others, with a new knighthood, which he intended to e&s;tabli&s;h in comme|moration of his miraculous pre&s;ervation, called Knights of the Royal Oak, for which a return was made of &s;it per&s;ons with their qualifications, as in the notes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A li&s;t of per&s;ons names, who were fit and qualified to be made knights of the royal oak; with the value of their e&s;tates A.

He chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his great muni&s;icence and charity, and by his pub|lic &s;pirit; for, con&s;idering him&s;elf principally as &s;teward of the large revenues belonging to his See, he laid out a great &s;hare of them in repairing and rebuilding the &s;everal edifices belonging to the bi&s;hopric, which were either demoli&s;hed or
<PB N="538" REF="595">neglected during the civil wars. He repaired the ca&s;tle at Bi&s;hop-Auckland, which upon the eizure of bihops lands was betowed upon Sir Arthur Hafilrigge, who, de&s;igning to make it his principal &s;eat, and not liking the the old-fa&s;hioned building, re&s;olved to crect a new and beautiful fabric, all of one pile, according to the mo&s;t elegant fa&s;hion of tho&s;e times. To prepare materials for executing this de&s;ign, he pulled down the &s;pacious and magni&s;icent chapel built by bi&s;hop Beke in the time of Edward I, and proceeded to erect his new palace in a large court on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the old ca&s;tle: Bi&s;hop Co&s;in, &s;oon after his con&s;ecration, remarking that great part of the materials u&s;ed in that building were taken from the old con&s;ecrated edifice, not only refu&s;ed to u&s;e it as his habitation, though it was commodiou&s;ly contrived and nobly built, but took it wholly down, and with the &s;tone thereof built the beautiful chapel which at pre&s;ent &s;tands near the palace. Under the mid|dle aile he con&s;tructed a convenient vault for his own &s;epulture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugd. p. 82.</NOTE>. He enlarged the ca&s;tle at Durham with &s;everal additional buildings, and put the whole into com|pleat repair. He re&s;tored the bi&s;hop's hou&s;e at Darlington, which was then very ruinous: He al&s;o enriched his new chapel at Auckland, and that in the ca&s;tle of Durham, with &s;everal pieces of gilt plate, books, and other co&s;tly ornaments, to remain to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the bi&s;hopric for ever; all which expenditures amounted to no le&s;s a &s;um than 26,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He likewi&s;e built and endowed two ho&s;pitals, the one at Durham, for eight poor people, on an old foundation of bi&s;hop Langley's; and another at Auckland for four people. He rebuilt the &s;chools, as wings to the edi|fice for the Durham ho&s;pital. He al&s;o built a library adjoining to the Exchequer on the Place Green, with an entrance from the private gardens of the palace; this &s;tructure, and the pictures with which it is ornamented, co&s;t 800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the books he gave thereto 2,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and added an annual pen&s;ion of 20 marks for ever for a librarian. The college of di&s;&s;olved prebends at Auckland, purcha&s;ed by Sir Arthur Hafilrigge, and by him forfeited to the king, which Charles II. gave to bi&s;hop Con&s;in, in fee, he gave to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors bi&s;hops of Durham for ever; the yearly value thereof being 320 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He rebuilt the ea&s;t end of the chapel at Peter-hou&s;e in Cambridge, which co&s;t 320 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and gave in books to the library 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He founded eight &s;cholar&s;hips in the &s;ame univer&s;ity, viz. five in Peter-hou&s;e of ten pounds a year each, and three in Gonvil and Caius college of teenty nobles a-piece per annum; both which, together with a provi&s;ion of eight pounds yearly to the common che&s;t of the two colleges re&s;pectively, amounted to 2500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He likewi&s;e made an augmentation of 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year to the vicarage of St Andrew's, at Auckland.

In a word, this generous bi&s;hop, during the eleven years he
<PB N="539" REF="596">&s;at in the See of Durham, is &s;aid to have &s;pent above 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year in pious and charitable u&s;es. The lea&s;e of the manors of Gate&s;head and Whickham for 99 years, granted by bi&s;hop Barnes to queen Elizabeth, being near expiring, he granted a concurrent lea&s;e thereof, to his &s;on-in-law Sir Gilbert Gerrard, for 21 years, which the dean and chapter refu&s;ing to con&s;irm, they were &s;ummoned to attend the king and council; and the king a&s;king dean Sudbury, if it was again&s;t his con&s;cience to confirm this lea&s;e, he an&s;wered "No; but &mdash;" and was going to give hi; rea&s;ons again&s;t it: The king replied, "If it is not again&s;t your con&s;cience, I will have no <HI>buts,</HI> &s;o go home and confirm it;" which was done accordingly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gray's MSS.</NOTE>. At the time bi&s;hop Co&s;in was appointed to the See of Durham, mo&s;t of the church lea&s;es were expired; &s;o that he received, for fines on renewals, a &s;um not le&s;s than 20,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> as he admits by his will.

<P>In this prelate's time, a &s;tatute was made, (12th Cha. II.) whereby the court of wards and liveries, tenures <HI>in capite,</HI> and by knights &s;ervice and purveyance, were all taken away. The preamble of the act &s;et forth, <Q>That they and the con&s;e|quents &startq;upon the &s;ame have been much more burthen&s;ome, grievous, and prejudi|cial to the kingdom, than beneficial to the king." And it was thereby declared, That all lands &s;hould be thenceforth di&s;charged of tenures by homage, e&s;cuage, voyages royal, and all charges for the &s;ame, ward&s;hips incident to tenure by knights &s;ervice, and values and forfeitures of marriage, <HI>aide pour fille marrier,</HI> and &endq;<HI>aide pour faire fitz chivalier.</HI></Q> Such dignities as the &s;tatute of Henry VIII. left to this palatinate, &s;uffered great diminution by this act; though infinite ble&s;&s;ings flowed to the &s;ubjects, by relieving them from the dregs of the old Norman &s;lavery, and that weaker badge of &s;ervility created by Henry VIII. in the 32d and 33d years of his reign, when the court of wards was e&s;tabli&s;hed; now, under the au&s;pices of an enlightened and beneficent age, all the ancient tenures, &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;ubject, were turned into free and common &s;occage, except tenures in <HI>frankalmoin,</HI> to piou$ u&s;es; by copy of court rolls, or grand &s;erjeantry, on per&s;onal &s;ervices to the king. As this change made a con&s;iderable alteration in the bi&s;hop's revenues, and the king had received a compen&s;ation by &s;everal duties granted him, the bi&s;hop petitioned to have a remittance of the yearly &s;um of 880 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> remaining a charge upon his palatinate, part of the &s;um of 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> originally impo&s;ed by queen Elizabeth, towards the &s;up|port of her military e&s;tabli&s;hments at Berwick; which was accordingly granted.</P>
<P>In the year 1666 began a conte&s;t between the bi&s;hop and the people of his pala|tinate, concerning their right to repre&s;entatives in parliament: In Cromwell's time they were admitted to that privilege, and were not willing now to relinqui&s;h it.

<ITEM>4. The prejudice which the freeholders and inhabitants in the &s;aid county pala|$ine of Durham may &s;uffer for want of repre&s;entatives in their trade, and in the pro|portioning of aids by general laws and otherwi&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. This doth not in any &s;ort impair the juri&s;diction of the county palatine, no more than the act that enabled Che&s;ter to fend knights and burge&s;&s;es did, which re|mains &s;till as compleat a county palatine as Durham is."</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To the&s;e rea&s;ons the bi&s;hop gave the following an&s;wers in oppo&s;ition to the coun|ty having knights and burge&s;&s;es:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. It has always been held a &s;pecial privilege belonging to the bi&s;hopric and county palatine of Durham, to be exempt from &s;ending any knights or burge&s;&s;es to &s;it in parliament for that county.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. All the bi&s;hops of Durham at their fir&s;t entrance and inthronization, take a &s;olemn oath, to de&s;end and pre&s;erve all accu&s;tomed rights, privileges and immuni|ties
<PB N="541" REF="598">(whereof the afore&s;aid privilege and exemption is one) appertaining to his bi&s;hopric and county palatine, and this oath the bi&s;hop is bound to ob&s;erve, nor doth he yet know any expedient that will free him from it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If any law &s;hould be now made to take away that privilege, it would prove to be a great innovation, and alter the condition and con&s;titution of that bi&s;hopric.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The election of knights and burge&s;&s;es cannot be made in that county without the king's writ; but <HI>breve regis non currit in comitatu palatino Dunelmen&s;i,</HI> which is the u&s;ual return that the bi&s;hop of Durham maketh to any writ &s;ent unto him, in ca&s;e any of his liberties and immunities be infringed by it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The city of Durham and all other corporations in that county, hold their char|ters from the bi&s;hop, to the ob&s;ervance of who&s;e privilege$ they are all &s;worn and bound, not to attempt or act any thing to the contrary.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. This attempt for knights and burge&s;&s;es was fir&s;t of all (about 53 years &s;ince) projected and made by a few di&s;contented gentlemen; who &s;ought thereby, as they then threatened, to le&s;&s;en the bi&s;hop's power in his courts and juri&s;diction over that county palatine: But their attempt prevailed not at that time, nor ever &s;ince in any parliaments following to this day. Neither could the king's royal progenitors ever be per&s;uaded to give way to any &s;uch new attempt or innovation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. The whole county hath heretofore with&s;tood that innovation when it was fir&s;t be|gun, without the con&s;ent of the bi&s;hop; and in like manner, many of the freehold|ers and gentlemen there with&s;tand it now; though &s;ome others among them, &s;hew them&s;elves vehemently de&s;irous of it; and for the better obtaining of their purpo&s;e, have by their agents offered the bi&s;hop for the time being, that he &s;hall have the no|mination of one knight and one burge&s;s, if by con&s;ent an act of parliament may be pa&s;&s;ed for it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. There was never yet any precedent for &s;ending &s;uch knights and burge&s;&s;es out of his bi&s;hopric and county palatine, but only in the time of Cromwell the u&s;urper, who violently took away the rights and privileges of it, and gave leave to the di&s;|loyal and di&s;affected party of the county to chu&s;e one knight, and one burge&s;s, af|ter the murther of the late king.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. The per&s;ons who now labour to &s;et up knights and burge&s;&s;es in this county palatine (and tell the bi&s;hop that they hope and expect to prevail in it, whether he will give his con&s;ent to it or no) have neither any right nor nece&s;&s;ity to do it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. For though they pretend to have the &s;ame claim and right which all other counties have in this particular, yet the pre&s;cription, cu&s;tom, and practice in this county palatine is again&s;t them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. And whereas they complain, that divers taxes and royal aids are impo&s;ed upon them in parliament without their con&s;ent, having no knights and burge&s;&s;es there to &s;it and vote for them, yet this impo&s;ition, is no other than hath been al|ways heretofore u&s;ed; nor hath any exception till now of late, been taken again&s;t it, neither herein do they &s;uffer any injury or inconvenience, having had &s;pecial care taken of them in all times by the bi&s;hops of Durham concerning the propor|tion of their taxes, whereof (being equally rated with other counties) they have no rea&s;on to complain; and having received the benefit of all other laws made for the
<PB N="542" REF="599">kingdom, and in particular the late law of freeing them from ward&s;hips, when they had no knights and burge&s;&s;es of their own to &s;peak for them in it, or to give con&s;ent thereunto, as all the re&s;t of the kingdom had. Add hereunto, for further an&s;wer to that objection and complaint, that divers &s;uch taxes and impo&s;itions are laid up|on the clergy in that bi&s;hopric and county palatine, who have no repre&s;entatives ad|mitted to con&s;ent and vote for them in parliament, but only their own bi&s;hop of Durham.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. But the bi&s;hop of Durham in declining to give his a&s;&s;ent unto the pre&s;ent de&s;ires of &s;ome gentlemen in this county palatine, who endeavour to make them|&s;elves knights and burge&s;&s;es after the example of the county palatine of Che&s;ter, (which is a cafe far different from this of Durham) is tender herein of the good and welfare of the county, in &s;aving them much trouble, expences and charges, which might otherwi&s;e be brought upon them, and careful to pre&s;erve the ancient con&s;ti|tution and cu&s;tom of his bi&s;hopric and county palatine, which he and his predece&s;|&s;ors have held by pre&s;cription for many ages; being well a&s;&s;ured, that the people and inhabitants within this county palatine do receive a great benefit, ea&s;e and quietne&s;s by the immunities and privileges which they continually enjoy there un|der the bi&s;hop of Durham; of which privileges and immunities, this is, and ever hath been one, to be exempt from &s;ending any knights or burge&s;&s;es to parliament.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>JOHN DURESME."</P>
<P>Afterwards, the bi&s;hop gave the following further an&s;wers to the freeholders:</P>
<P N="1">"1. All the counties of England &s;end knights and burge&s;&s;es to the parliament, but the bi&s;hopric and county palatine of Durham &s;endeth none; for it hath, by an|cient cu&s;tom and pre&s;cription, an immunity to the contrary, which the bi&s;hop of Durham is bound by oath to pre&s;erve: Nor is there any convincing rea&s;on to be given why it &s;hould in this particular be like to other counties; or that the ancient exemption and privilege of it &s;hould now be altered or taken away, to &s;atisfy the de&s;ires of &s;ome gentlemen and freeholders in that county, where there are a great many other con&s;iderable per&s;ons who de&s;ire no &s;uch alteration; humbly conceiving, that the honour and ju&s;tice of a parliament will never &s;uffer any &s;uch bill to pa&s;s again&s;t the bi&s;hop's accu&s;tomed right in that county palatine, confirmed by all his maje&s;ty's royal progenitors.</P>
<P>The county of Durham never yet had any knight or burge&s;s, &s;ave only one of each &s;ort elected for the &s;hire and city there by order from Cromwell the late u&s;ur|per, after he and his pretended parliament had murdered the king's royal father of ble&s;&s;ed memory, and taken away both the bi&s;hopric and all the rights of that county palatine, which by the public laws and con&s;titutions of the kingdom, with all the rights and ancient cu&s;toms thereunto belonging, have &s;ince reverted to the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e late and new repre&s;entatives (as they then called them) were Lilburn and Smith, cho&s;en by a di&s;affected and di&s;loyal part of the country, the re&s;t (far more con&s;iderable than that party was) not con&s;enting to them, nor acknowledging them|&s;elves to be repre&s;ented by them, no more than they or any other of this kingdom of England were repre&s;ented by the knights and burge&s;&s;es which Cromwell called from Scotland and Ireland to &s;it with them in his illegal parliament: Other exam|ple
<PB N="543" REF="600">than this alone cannot be produced by any of the gentlemen or freeholders in the county palatine of Durham, for the violation and di&s;turbance of the ancient right and exemption there, in this particular.</P>
<P N="2">2. This peculiar in&s;tance of granting knights and burge&s;&s;es to the county palatine of Che&s;ter, is not of force enough to infer, that therefore the like grant ought to be made unto the county palatine of Durham.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e there is no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity now to have knights and burge&s;&s;es in the county palatine of Durham, as there was in the county palatine of Che&s;ter, which in the 34th year of Henry VIII. had been about 280 years before, taken into the crown by Henry III. who gave other lands in exchange for it, to the aunts and next co|heirs of John Scot, the la&s;t earl and count palatine of Che&s;ter, of the blood of Hugh Lupus (to whom William the Conqueror fir&s;t gave that palatine juri&s;diction); to which &s;ei&s;ure, that king was induced, as the record &s;aith, <HI>ne tanta hoereditas in|ter colos diduceretur.</HI> Whereupon the county palatine of Che&s;ter &s;uffered many in|conveniencies.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding the grants which were &s;ometimes made thereof to the per|&s;on of the king's elde&s;t &s;on, yet upon his death, it de&s;cended not upon his heirs, but returned again to the crown.</P>
<P>And after Wales had been totally &s;ubdued by king Edward II, the kings of Eng|land when they created their elde&s;t &s;on earl of Che&s;tor, they created him al&s;o prince of Wales; which in the 27th of Henry VIII, being by act of parliament annexed to England, had &s;ome knights and burge&s;&s;es appointed for them to &s;it in the great council of the realm.</P>
<P>And hereupon the inhabitants within the county palatine of Che&s;ter, took occa|&s;ion &s;even years after, to petition the king and parliament for knights and burge&s;&s;es of their own, le&s;t otherwi&s;e their liberties &s;hould be infringed by their neighbours of Wales.</P>
<P>And 'tis to be noted, that king Henry VIII, from the time of his coming to the crown, to the time of pa&s;&s;ing that act in the 34th year of his reign, had not been plea&s;ed to confer that county palatine of Che&s;ter upon his heir apparent, but re|&s;erved it in his own hands.</P>
<P>And therefore in regard of all the&s;e rea&s;ons, the inhabitants within that county palatine thought it convenient and needful for them to &s;ue for knights and burge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>All which rea&s;ons belong nothing to the bi&s;hopric and county palatine of Dur|ham that was never yet taken into the crown, but by unju&s;t means in the minority of king Edward VI. at what time neverthele&s;s there was no fuit or appointment made for knights and burge&s;&s;es to be elected in this county for the parliament.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the inhabitants within the county palatine of Che&s;ter at the time of pa&s;&s;ing that act (as appeareth in the preface thereof) had a long while &s;u&s;&s;ered in their bo|dies, goods, and lands, and in their civil government contrary to law; which can|not be &s;aid of the inhabitants of the county palatine of Durham, under the bi&s;hop's government and juri&s;diction there.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, that very act which introduced knights and burge&s;&s;es into the county, palatine of Che&s;&s;er, brought a great innovation upon it in one of the be&s;t privileges
<PB N="544" REF="601">thereof, by altering the accu&s;tomed writs concerning the payment of debts in that county, as appears by the act it&s;elf. The lo&s;s of which privilege in the county pa|latine of Durham, would be a great prejudice and inconvenience to the inhabitants thereof: Other innovations aro&s;e afterwards upon this occa&s;ion in the county pala|tine of Che&s;ter; which therefore is no good example for the bi&s;hop or county pa|latine to follow.</P>
<P N="3">3. True it is; that the freeholders and inhabitants within this county palatine of Durham, are, and ever have been &s;ubject to pay, as all the re&s;t of the kingdom doth, all aids and taxes impo&s;ed upon them by act of parliament; but it is not true, that becau&s;e they pay &s;uch aids and taxes, therefore they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have their own peculiar knights and burge&s;&s;es cho&s;en by them&s;elves to give con&s;ent thereunto. For in all times heretofore they have paid the &s;ame, and received great benefit by other laws pa&s;&s;ed in parliament, and lately by the law of taking away ward&s;hips when they had no knights and burge&s;&s;es of their own to &s;it there.</P>
<P>Nor was this ever counted a grievance, till of late &s;ome di&s;contented per&s;ons pre|&s;umed to take exceptions again&s;t it; e&s;pecially at the &s;e&s;&s;ions of peace held at Dur|ham in Sept. 1666, where they procured the grand jurymen to complain of it to them&s;elves &s;itting then upon the bench, (before the bi&s;hop, being at that time &s;ome miles di&s;tant from Durham could come to &s;it there with them) calling it, as appears by the petition then preferred, "a great di&s;honour to the country to want knights and burge&s;&s;es, who &s;hould vote with their fellow &s;ubjects in parliament, and not &s;tand at the door of that hou&s;e with a petition, where they ought to &s;it as judges, and not to pay tho&s;e aids and taxes, or be &s;ubject to tho&s;e laws which they did not vote or con&s;ent to them&s;elves;" adding further, "that the parliament owed them near 26,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for paying the Scotch army 21 years before;" and &s;uppo&s;ing, "that this money would be procured for them from the parliament, and that the pre&s;ent aids and taxes would be mitigated, if they had knights and burge&s;&s;es of their own to &s;it there, and importune the hou&s;e of commons for that purpo&s;e." This was the &s;ub&s;tance of their petition and de&s;ire at that time, which is &s;till fomented among them by tho&s;e per&s;ons whom they have employed to &s;olicit the parliament for their purpo&s;e at the charge of the county; whereupon they will certainly bring a far greater charge, if knights and burge&s;&s;es &s;hould be elected and maintained from time to time with the allowance of their wages due by law: And thus while they pre|tend to mitigate and le&s;&s;en the charge of the county, the truth is, they intend to augment it; from which intention and charge the bi&s;hop is the more careful to &s;ave the county.</P>
<P>There can be no &s;trength in this rea&s;on, whereby they would infer the nece&s;&s;ity of electing knights and burge&s;&s;es to con&s;ent unto the&s;e payments of aids and taxes, unle&s;s they will al&s;o infer they are not to be paid without their con&s;ent, which is injurious to the king and parliament, and contrary to the dutiful and ancient prac|tice of this county palatine.</P>
<P>The whole clergy of this county have no repre&s;entatives in the commons hou&s;e of parliament, and yet they take no exceptions (as the&s;e men do) again&s;t the pay|ments impo&s;ed upon them by law for aids and taxes to the king; and the bi&s;hop's
<PB N="545" REF="602">cu&s;tomary tenants and copyholders being by far the greater number of this county, (whom the&s;e men would have excluded from having any voice in the election of their new de&s;ired knights and burge&s;&s;es) make the like payments according to their duty; but that all the&s;e pay their aids and taxes in this county, contrary to all law and right of &s;ubjects, (as the grand jurymen &s;aid in their petition for the freeholders) it may be well thought that no other &s;ober men will &s;ay.</P>
<P N="4">4. The freeholders of this county palatine &s;uffer no prejudice herein. Nor can any one in&s;tance be given of it from the fir&s;t beginning of this monarchy, that any &s;uch prejudice as is here &s;urmi&s;ed ever yet happened in the county palatine of Durham, more than in any other counties that have knights and burge&s;&s;es to repre&s;ent them in parliament.</P>
<P>This rea&s;on &s;eems to reflect upon the honour and ju&s;tice of the parliament, which, notwith&s;tanding this &s;urmi&s;e, u&s;eth to take care of all per&s;ons (generally repre&s;ented in the name of all the commons of England) that they &s;hall &s;uffer no wrong or prejudice in their public proceedings, and are ready to receive the ju&s;t complaints and grievances (if any be) that are at any time pre&s;ented to them; wherein the bi&s;hop of Durham (who hath a peculiar intere&s;t in the government and welfare of this county palatine) is always pre&s;ent in the hou&s;e of peers either in per|&s;on or by proxy, to propo&s;e any thing that may conduce to the benefit thereof, and to the redre&s;&s;ing of any ju&s;t grievance in it, which may be brought to his know|ledge.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is much to be feared, that if the&s;e gentlemen might have their de&s;ires, the juri&s;diction of the county palatine of Durham will be greatly impaired: For tho&s;e men who fir&s;t of all about 54 years &s;ince began to move and &s;et forward this altera|tion, (which was then contradicted by the ju&s;tices, gentlemen, and freeholders of the whole county) made open profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid, "that they would humble the bi&s;hop and his courts, together with all his clergy, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of his cathedral church." Which animo&s;ities are &s;till too rife again&s;t them among many per&s;ons in the country at this day, and may prove to be of very dangerous con&s;equence again&s;t both church and &s;tate of this kingdom, and again&s;t the bi&s;hop's pre&s;cription and rights of government in this county; which being peculiar to him, if once alter|ed and dimini&s;hed, it cannot be &s;aid to continue &s;o compleat a county palatine as it was before.</P>
<P>The act for Che&s;ter hath impaired that county palatine in three &s;pecial innova|tions already; one concerning writs i&s;&s;ued out of the exchequer there for debts, as was ob&s;erved before; another about the awarding of exigents and proclamations contrary to the former privilege and cu&s;tom of that county palatine; and a third, concerning the nomination of the cu&s;tos rotulorum. In all which, and the lo&s;s of divers other privileges complained of in that county, the bi&s;hop and county pala|tine of Durham never yet would follow them.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing that the county palatine of Che&s;ter &s;hould have &s;uffered nothing to the prejudice of their rights and privileges there, yet this were no &s;ufficient rea|&s;on to extort from the bi&s;hop of Durham any of his ancient rights and exemptions whether he will or no, as the&s;e men now endeavour to do, by procuring an act of
<PB N="546" REF="603">parliament to alter the con&s;titution and cu&s;toms of this county, and to empower them to elect knights and burge&s;&s;es there without his con&s;ent; who, if any writ &s;hould be brought unto him for &s;uch elections to be made within his juri&s;diction, is bound by oath to an&s;wer (as in ca&s;es of like nature the bi&s;hops of Durham have al|ways done) for the pre&s;ervation of their ancient cu&s;toms and liberties in that county palatine, that <HI>breve regis non currit in comitat$ palatino Dunelmen&s;i.</HI>"</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop al&s;o wrote &s;everal letters to Colonel John Tempe&s;t and Ralph Davi|&s;on, e&s;qrs; concerning knights and burge&s;&s;es in the county of Durham, of which the following was the la&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable:</P>

<P>"This &s;hall be my an&s;wer to your letter of ye&s;terday, wherein I find nothing but a repetition of what you have often &s;aid before, without any one new rea&s;on added, whereby you might give your&s;elves any hope to convince or incline me to your own will, in the way that you have taken. You &s;ay, that you have made your addre&s;&s;es to me from time to time with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and truly I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that you have other whiles u&s;ed &s;uch words of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion when you came to treat with me, about &s;etting up new knights and burge&s;&s;es in the bi&s;hopric: But by your actions that have followed &s;uch your &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive words, it appeareth plain|ly, that when you &s;pake the words, you never intended to &s;ubmit to me at all, and have therefore pro&s;ecuted &s;uch your intentions with all eagerne&s;s contrary to my advice. You &s;ay you have &s;ought, and endeavoured very often to per&s;uade me that I would yield to your de&s;ires; but I have as often endeavoured al&s;o to per&s;uade you, that you would yield to mine, which hitherto I believe hath more rea&s;on in them than yours. And becau&s;e you cannot prevail upon me, and bring me to your bent, you profe&s;s you are very &s;orry, as I truly think you are, but I pray let me return upon you your own words, and &s;ay, that I am al&s;o &s;orry I cannot pre|vail upon you to make you give over this eager pro&s;ecution of the bu&s;ine&s;s, which you have taken in hand, as I &s;uppo&s;e, again&s;t the general good and quiet of the county, and as you know well, again&s;t the con&s;ent, both of my&s;elf and a con&s;ide|rable party there, and as I know well, again&s;t the accu&s;tomed rights and privileges of my bi&s;hopric.

You have no precedent either for preferring a bill without the bi&s;hop's con&s;ent, or &s;etting up knights and burge&s;&s;es for to &s;it in parliament, but only in Cromwell's time to &s;erve in his parliament, after he had murthered the late excellent king, and de&s;troyed both the bi&s;hopric and the county palatine rights annexed to it.

Towards the end of the year 1687, he was employed, with the bi&s;hops of Roche&s;ter and Peterborough, to draw up a form of thank&s;giving for the queen's being with child. Thus he con&s;tantly complied with the king's de|&s;igns, and coincided with his humours, till he di&s;covered that the prince of Orange's party was likely to prevail: This induced him to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the council-board; and as he was &s;ervile, &s;o was he abject: He threw him&s;elf in the way of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, to tell him he was &s;orry for having &s;o long concurred with the court; and begged to be reconciled to his grace and the other bi&s;hops<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 527.</NOTE>.

The bi&s;hops of Dur|ham have for many ages claimed and held this county palatine by pre&s;cription; and the rea&s;on that hath been always a&s;&s;igned for the u&s;age of &s;uch county pala|tine was, that it bordering upon Scotland, then frequently in wars with England, it was requi&s;ite to lodge an immediate power in &s;ome neighbouring nobleman, to rai&s;e troops to defend the country, and oppo&s;e the &s;udden inroads of the Scots, and that for expedition &s;ake was often nece&s;&s;ary, before the kings of England could be timely con&s;ulted, they being often abroad in foreign dominions, in wars, &endq;and upon other public occa&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>Mr Spearman al&s;o tells us, <Q>That bi&s;hop Crewe, in the latter end of his time, &startq;made an entry upon an e&s;tate at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The e&s;tates at Hulam and Sheraton, which gave occa&s;ion for the following letter, were part of the in|heritance of the family of Stroud, and afterwards &s;old by Mr Evans to lady Carr, widow of Sir Ralph Carr &s;enior, and by her devi&s;ed to her grand&s;on Ralph Carr of Cocken, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> who, in the year 17$9, &s;old the &s;ame to Anthony Wilkin&s;on of Durham, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> for 8520 <ABBR>l</ABBR> and in who&s;e family it remains.&mdash;Gyll's MSS.</NOTE> Hullam and Sheraton, upon the death of &s;erjeant Stroud, he claiming the &s;ame as an e&s;cheat for want of an heir, and got the te|nants to attorn, and kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the heir at law, Mr Evans, brought his ejectment. This the bi&s;hop illegally did, without an office found; but was told by the heir at law's &s;olicitor, (Mr Wm Lee) in a letter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"My lord, the rights and privileges of your lord&s;hip's county palatine having been often examined in parliament, upon &s;everal petitions and informations, which have been exhibited both by and again&s;t your lord&s;hip's predece&s;&s;ors, Mr Evans is advi&s;ed by his coun&s;el, to exhibit his information in parliament again&s;t your lord&s;hip; for that your lord&s;hip and agents have entered upon and detain his inheritance, (under pre|tence for being an e&s;cheat) without having either your lord&s;hip's title fir&s;t &s;ound upon record, or &s;uing out of legal proce&s;s, to warrant the entry of your lord&s;hip's officers.
<P>This proceeding, my lord, he is advi&s;ed, is a manife&s;t violation of the rights and privileges of the gentle|men and freeholders of the county of Durham, e&s;tabli&s;hed to them by the public &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of your lord|&s;hip's predece&s;&s;ors; confirmed and ratified by the crown.</P>
<P>That it is directly contrary to the known u&s;age and con&s;titution of the county palatine; that it tends to ve&s;t a higher prerogative in your lord&s;hip, than is claimed and enjoyed by the crown it&s;elf, who cannot, in this ca&s;e, enter upon the e&s;tate of any &s;ubject, without an inqui&s;ition fir&s;t ta$$n to find the title of the crown:</P>
<P>That it $ead$ to &s;ubvert and evade the &s;everal laws made for re&s;training of the prerogative, and for &s;ecuring the rights and properties of the &s;ubject; particularly by the &s;tatute of Magna Charta, chap. 29. which pro|vides, that no &s;$$emen be di&s;&s;eized of his freehold, without lawful judgment of his peers. Stat. 28. Edw. III. chap. $word$ which f$rther provide$, that no man &s;hall be di&s;inherited without due proce&s;s of law; and hath been fine$ confirmed by the petition of right, 3 Char. I. chap. 1. and the &s;tatute 16 Char. I. chap. 14 that it is al&s;o contrary to the &s;tatute of 5 Rich. II. chap. 7. which provides, that none &s;hall make entry into any lands, $span$ the en$$y is given by law: As al&s;o the &s;tatute 8 Hen. VI. chap. 9. made again&s;t forcible detainer o$ po$$$&s;&s;ion; and &s;everal other &s;tatutes and public laws, too tedious to be recited:</P>
<P>That if &s;uch proceeding as this &s;hould be brought into practice, it would ab&s;olutely de&s;troy the ancient privilege, which all the freeholder$ in this county l$$e hitherto enjoyed, in having an opportunity given them to defend their rights, b$th $span$ the inqui&s;ition, o$ finding the title of the bi&s;hop, and traver&s;ing the impo&s;ition after i$ is take$.</P>
<P>And if this proceeding again&s;t Mr Evans can be ju&s;tified, it is conceived, the bi&s;hop of Durham may, un|der colour of $span$ right, enter and &s;eize upon all men's inheritances within the county, and put all to make out their $word$, before the bi&s;hop makes out any.</P>
<P>Your $ord&s;h $word$ certainly been very ill advi&s;ed in this affair, and if the opinion of any $$ni$$$t coun&s;el has been taken, $span$ have either been mi&s;informed, or not very well in&s;tructed in the con&s;titution, rights and $word$ of the county palatine.</P>
<P>$span$, undertake to produce five thou&s;and precedents of inqui&s;itions taken, for finding the bi&s;hop's title upon record, before an entry was ever made; and it does appear, that the bi&s;hop's officers u&s;ed always $$en$er, in ca&s;es of this nature, by virtue of a &s;pecial writ for that purpo&s;e, &s;etting $orth the title as it was found; and (indeed my lord) I have rea&s;on to believe that &s;uch a &s;eizure at this was never at|tempted by any of your lord&s;hip's predece&s;&s;ors, &s;ince the time of Anthony Be$e.</P>
<P>That bi&s;hop (who&s;e character your lord&s;hip cannot be unacquainted with) did take upon him to &s;eize on &s;everal e&s;tates within the county, without &s;uing out any writ or commi&s;&s;ion for having his title fir&s;t &s;ound, and without awarding of any proce&s;s, to warrant that entry: But how &s;en&s;ible the gentlemen of the county then were of the tendency it had to bring them under &s;lavery and arbitraty government, what di&s;turbance it bred within the county, and what were the con&s;equences that attended that ca&s;e, will be&s;t appear from the records of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only beg leave to put your lord&s;hip in mind, that one of the articles then agreed to between that bi&s;hop and the gentlemen and freeholders of the county, upon the mediation of king Edward I. was, That neither the bi&s;hop, nor any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hould ever afterwards &s;eize any man's e&s;tate without fir&s;t &s;uing a writ or commi&s;&s;ion out of the bi&s;hop's court of chancery.</P>
<P>I doubt (my lord) your lord&s;hip's agents do not di&s;tingui&s;h very well betwixt the ca&s;e of the bi&s;hop of Dur|ham, and of an ordinary lord of any manor, where no per&s;on is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, again&s;t whom he may bring his e&s;cheat, for otherwi&s;e, the lord of the manor would be without remedy.</P>
<P>But the bi&s;hop of Durham will appear, I believe, to &s;tand upon a different foot; he has rather remedy for e&s;cheat, and ought to be con&s;idered as a public per&s;on, <HI>(qua&s;i rex)</HI> and under a capacity much different from a private lord of a petty manor; &s;uch a right in a private lord, and in a particular ca&s;e only, cannot be hurtful to the public; but &s;uch a power in the crown, or in the bi&s;hop of Durham, who has <HI>$$ra regalia,</HI> within his county palatine, may admit of a different con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be agreed, my lord, that the bi&s;hops of Durham have been always e&s;teemed to be per&s;ons inve&s;ted with royal dignity, or as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the ancient record, <HI>juri&s;dictionem tempora$em in omnes &s;$lditos &s;uos libertatis Dunelmen&s;is et authoritaten: regium tanquam per&s;onae privilegits regalibus, in&s;ig$it$p$$ mini&s;$ros, exer|$u$runt;</HI> or as another record expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>tanquam reges et principes mitram ge&s;&s;$$t $o$o $word$ in $$gnum &s;u$e regalitatis;</HI> yet it mu&s;t be allowed at the &s;ame time, that all the liberties of the bi&s;hop have been adjudged to be derived, and &s;till dependent upon the crown, to be circum&s;cribed by the &s;ame laws, to be all forfeited up|on the mi&s;u&s;er or abu&s;e of them, during the bi&s;hop's time who commits the abu&s;e; and that they have been accordingly &s;eized, both upon judgment in parliament, and other counts; and that the rea&s;on given in &s;ome of the&s;e judgments, why the bi&s;hop's liberty ought to be forfeit, for any mi&s;u&s;er or abu&s;e of it, is, <HI>quia ju&s;tum e&s;t quod in eo quo pecc$t. in e$$pumatur;</HI> or as we find it expre&s;&s;ed in another of them, <HI>in $o quo in&s;ignitis de$inquit, &s;it de jure puni$$dus.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort (my lord) Mr Evans is advi&s;ed, this proceeding is a very great mi&s;u&s;er of the liberty, and he having received your lord&s;hip's an&s;wer, that he is not to expect any favour, or any re&s;itution of his e&s;tate, until he do$$ by law recover it; your lord&s;hip having likewi&s;e thought &s;it to deprive him of all the be&s;t coun&s;el of the cir$uit, he is partly nece&s;&s;itated, and does re&s;olve to exhibit informations, both in parliament and the court of Queen's B$nch, in order to have the illegality of the&s;e proceedings examined into.</P>
<P>I was indeed de&s;ired by him to exhibit his information in parliament, the fir&s;t day that the parliament &s;at, but I was unwilling, in a ca&s;e of this nature, to take any advantage of your lord&s;hip's ab&s;ence, or to pro|ceed any further upon it, until I had given your lord&s;hip fair notice of the mea&s;ures intended to be taken; &s;o that your lord&s;hip might have an opportunity of advi&s;ing further upon the ca&s;e, and of being &s;atisfied, in the&s;e matters, from your lord&s;hip's own coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Mr Evans, my lord, knows nothing as yet, of my writing any thing to your lord&s;hip; but I mu&s;t do ju&s;|tice to my client, and intend to let him know by next po&s;t, what I have done, for he is very pre&s;&s;ing to have his pro&s;ecution carried on with all vigour and expedition; and it cannot, I think, rea&s;onably be expected, that an e&s;tate of three or four hundred pounds per annum &s;hould be lo&s;t without &s;ome &s;truggle; o$ that, the title of Mr Evans, which has been long &s;ince proved, allowed and decreed by the court of chancery, is to be ea&s;ily overthrown by an imaginary title, that has not yet, in fifty years time, been &s;o much as &s;ound by a common inque&s;t.</P>
<P>It is true, my lord, Mr Evans, at pre&s;ent, is &s;omewhat a &s;tranger to mo&s;t of the gentlemen of the country, and his intere&s;t in parliament is not, perhaps, very con&s;iderable; however, he does not doubt, but that ju&s;|tice will prevail in that honourable hou&s;e, and that &s;ome will be &s;ound to &s;tand up in the defence of the liber|ties of the country.</P>
<P>I am afraid, my lord, I have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed too much upon your lord&s;hip, but your lord&s;hip may be a&s;&s;ured, if it were not from a re&s;pect I have for $word$ lord&s;hip's honour, as well as intere&s;t. I &s;hould $span$ &s;o much pains to convince your lord&s;hip, and to deprive my&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, of the&s;e advantages, which I had rea&s;on to expect from &s;uch a pro&s;ecution as this might be.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ubmit the whole to your lord&s;hip's cen&s;ure and con&s;ideration, hoping your lord&s;hip will believe me to be, with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, my lord, your lord&s;hip's mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant, WILLIAM LEE."</P>

<P>The bi&s;hop made his public entry into his dioce&s;e on the 12th of July, 1722, when Dr Mangey made an elegant and public &s;peech of congratulation at Fare|well-hall: He went directly to the cathedral church to prayers before he entered his palace, and pronounced his ble&s;&s;ing from the throne; he preached from thence on Sunday the 15th of July, and on the 4th of Augu&s;t vi&s;ited Newca&s;tle.</P>

<P>From all which, as well as from the bill it&s;elf now before the Hou&s;e, it is plain, that the lea&s;es which are thereby intended to be made of mines, are not, nor can be included in the enabling act of 32 Hen. VIII. or of the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tatutes of the 1, 13, and 18 of queen Elizabeth; becau&s;e mines yet to be di&s;covered, can|not be hereditaments mo&s;t commonly letten, or occupied by farmers for twenty years; nor can lea&s;es be made of mines without impeachment of wa&s;te, becau&s;e defacing and de&s;troying the &s;urface, and &s;cooping out and carrying away the bowels of the inheritance, mu&s;t occa&s;ion the committing wa&s;te; nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that a rent can be re&s;erved as accountably paid for twenty years, of a mine which has never yet been letten; and if &s;o, deans and chapters mu&s;t have the &s;ame right now as they had at the common law before the &s;tatutes above-mentioned were made, which, it mu&s;t be admitted, have not as yet de&s;troyed, or taken away their right of confirmations of lea&s;es of mines, which they had, and now have by common law.</P>
<P>Lea&s;es made by par&s;ons and vicars are excepted out of the &s;tatute of 32 Hen. VIII. and are not good un|le&s;s confirmed by the patron and ordinary; and the pre&s;ent bill takes the &s;ame care of patron and ordinary, as that &s;tatute did; and it is hoped this honourable Hou&s;e will take the &s;ame care to pre&s;erve the undoubted rights of deans and chapters, there being no good rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;igned, why the rights of tho&s;e excepted out of the enabling &s;tatute of the 23 Hen. VIII. &s;hould be &s;aved; and yet at the &s;ame time, by the &s;ame bill, the rights of the per&s;ons not compri&s;ed therein &s;tand (in point of ju&s;tice) at lea&s;t on the &s;ame foot as to the rights and properties.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be admitted, that the bill gives the &s;ame power to deans and chapters, as to mines in their own proper e&s;tates, which it doth to archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops; and if deans and chapters had no right but as le&s;|&s;ors, &s;uch right ought to be excepted, as it is by the &s;aving clau&s;e; but &s;ince they have another plain right by the common law and immemorial u&s;age, namely, to confirm the lea&s;es of mines let by archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops, no ju&s;t rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned to take away and de&s;troy &s;uch their right by a new law, which the petitioners, the dean and chapter of Durham, do neither reque&s;t nor want, nor conceive to be of any benefit or advantage to them.</P>
<P>For which and other rea&s;ons, they humbly hope the bill &s;hall be rejected, or &s;o amended, as effectually to &s;ave their rights, as well with re&s;pect to confirmations, as all other their own ju&s;t rights; and likewi&s;e to pre&s;erve the inheritance of the church for the benefit of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the pre&s;ent archbi&s;hops and bi|&s;hops, who, as the petitioners conceive, were to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the deans and chapters, to con&s;ent to every grant, &amp;c. to be made by &s;uch archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops; by which re&s;traint all &s;uch inconveniences as might ari&s;e by repo&s;ing &s;o great a tru&s;t in a &s;ingle per&s;on, or by giving him power to prejudiice his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, might be, and would, as it hitherto hath been, effectually prevented.</P>
<P><HI>The ca&s;e of the copyhold and lea&s;ehold tenants of the bi&s;hopric of Durham. for enabling bi&s;hops and others to grant lea&s;es of mines not accu&s;tomably letten by them.</HI></P>
<P>The bi&s;hops of Durham being &s;ei&s;ed of divers manors within that bi&s;hopric, wherein are many copyhold lands, which have for many hundreds of years, and time immemorial, been held in fee, upon payment of &s;ines certain, and of certain &s;mall rents, the &s;aid e&s;tates have been &s;o freely enjoyed by the tenants thereof, that the &s;ame have been, in many re&s;pects, e&s;teemed as valuable, as mo&s;t freehold e&s;tates within the &s;aid bi&s;hopric.</P>
<P>The&s;e copyhold e&s;tates are transferred by &s;urrender, and upon &s;uch &s;urrender, or upon death of the copy|holder dying &s;ei&s;ed, admittances have been granted to the next heir, or to the party to who&s;e u&s;e the &s;ur|render was made; and according to the tenor or import of &s;uch admittances, the &s;aid copyholders have claimed their e&s;tate and intere&s;t in the &s;aid lands.</P>
<P>It has been apprehended, that the &s;aid copyhold tenants having, by &s;uch admittances, been admitted te|nants to the &s;aid lands, or to the <HI>terra firma</HI> or &s;oil of the &s;ame, and without any exception of the mines or quarries therein; that the copyholders, in &s;uch ca&s;e, are intitled to the &s;aid mines and quarries within their own grounds, as parcel of the &s;oil granted to them, &s;ave only in &s;uch particular ca&s;es where &s;uch mines or quarries have, within any particular lands, been accu&s;tomably granted, or held in lea&s;e, from the bi&s;hops of the &s;aid See.</P>
<P>But though the ab&s;olute right of the &s;aid copyhold tenants to the &s;aid mines and quarries, within their own grounds, hath been que&s;tioned by &s;ome per&s;ons; yet it hath never been denied, but that the copyholders of the &s;aid bi&s;hopric, as well as other copyhold tenants, have a &s;pecial right to the produce or profite of the &s;oil of their &s;aid lands, and that they may, for many purpo&s;es, dig and work the &s;oil thereof, and not only u&s;e the lime-&s;tone, and other quarries within the &s;aid grounds, but work the other mines al&s;o, where there is any cu&s;tom or u&s;age to warrant their &s;o doing</P>
<P>And whatever right or intere&s;t the bi&s;hop of Durham may be &s;uppo&s;ed, or pre&s;umed, to have in the mines within the&s;e copyhold lands; yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that he cannot by law ju&s;tify the breaking up or &s;ink|ing in the copyholders &s;aid grounds, or de&s;troying the profits of the &s;aid &s;oil, in order to &s;earch for or open any mines in the &s;ame; and that he cannot ju&s;tify the laying of any waggon-ways, or the making of other ways, through the &s;aid grounds, nor can fell &s;uch wood as may be nece&s;&s;ary for working the &s;aid mines, be|cau&s;e &s;uch liberties may very much tend to the ab&s;olute de&s;truction of the &s;aid copyholders e&s;tates.</P>
<P>The &s;aid copyhold tenants having &s;uch rights in their &s;aid e&s;tates, it is plain that the bi&s;hop cannot at pre|&s;ent, without their con&s;ents and &s;pecial agreement, open any mines within their &s;aid grounds, nor can fell the wood growing, nor grant any power, or proper liberties, for working the &s;aid mines; &s;o that in this ca&s;e, the only way at pre&s;ent to make profit or advantage of any &s;uch mines, is either for the bi&s;hop to obtain the leave and con&s;ent of the copyholders therein, and upon &s;uch terms and agreements as the copyholders &s;hall think fit, or that the copyholders &s;hould work them, upon making &s;ome rea&s;onable acknowledgment to the bi&s;hop, upon obtaining his licence to work the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Thus it is apprehended the ca&s;e &s;tands at pre&s;ent with re&s;pect to the copyhold tenants: And as to the lea&s;eholders, their lands and e&s;tates having been accu&s;tomably granted, time beyond memory, without either exception of mines, or of way leaves, or other exception that can give the bi&s;hop any manner of right to open or work mines within their inclo&s;ures, or to cut down their woods, or to do other acts that may tend to de&s;troy the profit of their farms; it is conceived, that as well the &s;aid lea&s;eholders, as copyhold tena$$$, may maintain actions at law for any wrong or injury that may be done in prejudice to their &s;everal and re|&s;pective rights.</P>
<P>Now it is humbly apprehended that this bill, which is depending for enabling bi&s;hops to grant lea&s;es of mines, without any &s;pecial &s;avings or proper provi&s;ions for the benefit of the &s;aid copyhold and lea&s;ehold te|nants, may (as the &s;ame is contrived) very much tend to the ruin and de&s;truction of their &s;aid e&s;tates; that it will give a liberty to the working of tho&s;e mines without their con&s;ents, to the laying of waggon-ways through their grounds, to the cutting down the wood for the u&s;e of the &s;aid mines, and the doing all man|ner of damage both in their corn-fields, meadows, and pa&s;tures, without providing the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction or recompence for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be alledged in defence of this bill, that the general &s;aving in it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the &s;everal particular and &s;pecial intere&s;ts both of the lea&s;eholders, copyholders, and other per&s;ons.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to which, it may be ob&s;erved, that the general &s;aving is no more than what's u&s;erted of cour&s;e in mo&s;t bills, but is found in many ca&s;es to be &s;o deficient, that it's frequently &s;upplied by &s;pecial &s;avings and other provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>That the mo&s;t that can be &s;aid to be &s;aved in this ca&s;e, is a right to bring actions for the recovery of da|mages that &s;hall be &s;u&s;tained by the working the &s;aid mines. But it is conceived, that where a power is once granted to lea&s;e out the mines, an action for damages is little more than an after-game; and the mo&s;t that can be got by &s;uch general &s;aving, may be a multitude of &s;uits, wherein the lea&s;ehold and copyhold te|nants may from time to time be involved with the bi&s;hop and his le&s;&s;ees.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it may be que&s;tioned how far the &s;aid general &s;aving may extend to any per&s;ons that &s;hall become le&s;&s;ees after the time of pa&s;&s;ing the &s;aid act.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, the giving &s;uch a power to lea&s;e the&s;e mines, may give a handle to &s;ome bi&s;hops to extend the power that's granted by the act, by in&s;erting exceptions of mines and way-leaves, and other new liberties, in all lea&s;es that &s;hall be renewed. And there is the greater rea&s;on to apprehend &s;uch proceeding, in regard that the &s;ame has been in &s;ome places already begun, which may tend further to defeat the rights of the &s;aid &s;everal lea&s;ehold tenants.</P>
<P>It may be further ob&s;erved, that there are &s;everal things very &s;peciou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted in this bill; as, that the opening of the&s;e mines will be of advantage to the public; as al&s;o, that &s;uch lea&s;es are to be granted and re|newed without the taking of any fines.</P>
<P>As to the benefit which may accrue to the public by the di&s;covery and working of more mines; it is con|ceived that the advantage to the public will be the &s;ame, in ca&s;e the &s;aid lea&s;eholders and copyholders have the working of tho&s;e mines which &s;hall be di&s;covered in their own grounds, upon their paying a rea&s;onable duty or acknowledgment to the bi&s;hop. And the giving a power by this act to let lea&s;es thereof to any &s;tranger, may be attended with many inconveniencies.</P>
<P>As to what is propo&s;ed with re&s;pect to the granting and renewal of lea&s;es without fines, it cannot be at all objected again&s;t, provided care be taken that this &s;eeming benefit is not defeated by the other dark clau&s;e in the &s;ame act, whereby &s;uch mines are excepted as have been accu&s;tomably letten within the greate&s;t part of twen|ty years pa&s;t; the de&s;igns of which clau&s;e ought, it's conceived, to be better explained on many accounts.</P>
<P>And it's hoped, that care will be taken not only for in&s;erting proper provi&s;ions in this bill with re&s;pect to the &s;aid lea&s;ehold and copyhold tenants, but that all lea&s;es to be granted by virtue of this act, &s;hall be for the u&s;ual terms of twenty-one years, or three lives; and that &s;uch lea&s;es as &s;hall be granted by any of the bi&s;hops, be confirmed by the dean and chapter; &s;o as care may be taken, that &s;uch rea&s;onable rents or duties may be re|&s;erved upon every &s;uch lea&s;e, as may be of &s;ome benefit to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for whom very little provi&s;ion is made by this bill.</P></NOTE>; for it appeared to them, that the
<PB N="570" REF="629">bill was calculated for the bi&s;hop of Durham and his family only, and not for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and to deprive the copyholders and ancient lea&s;eholders of
<PB N="571" REF="630">the mines within their inclo&s;ed grounds, which the bi&s;hops of Durham have of late claimed: The copyholds are de&s;cendable e&s;tates of inheritance to the &endq;heirs of the roll tenants.</Q></P>
<PB N="572" REF="631">
<P><Q>&startq;By this bold &s;tep, one family would have engro&s;&s;ed, as much as in them lay, mines of immen&s;e value to them&s;elves, without any regard either to the bi&s;hop's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, or to the tenants and their po&s;terity: The bill appeared to be of very ill con&s;equence, &s;ince the bi&s;hop of Durham, who is mo&s;tly concerned in coal|mines, had the le&s;s rea&s;on to attempt the mines within the inclo&s;ed copyholds of his tenants and ancient lea&s;eholds; for that he hath advantage enough by mines within many of the wa&s;tes of his &s;everal manors in the bi&s;hopric of Durham, which are very large, and where the bi&s;hop and his le&s;&s;ees may work mines for ages to come; he cannot therefore have any rea&s;on to injure the co|pyhold and ancient lea&s;ehold tenants, by endeavouring to de&s;troy their inclo&s;ed &endq;grounds,</Q> except the object of enriching his family by &s;uch lea&s;es.</P>
<P>Sir John Eden being then one of the repre&s;entatives for the county of Durham, &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this bill in the commons; though it mu&s;t not be forgot, that his fellow member, Mr Hedworth, refu&s;ed to give the tenants any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or to join in the petition again&s;t it; however, the oppo&s;itions again&s;t it were held &s;o rea|&s;onable, that the bill underwent great amendments, which occa&s;ioned tho&s;e who had the conduct of it before parliament to drop it, and it did not pa&s;s. But many of the old prebendaries of Durham &s;oon after dying, the bi&s;hop had the opportu|nity of preferring many of his friends in their places; and thereby had a majo|rity in the chapter to confirm &s;uch lea&s;es as he thought fit to grant.</P>
<P>Sir John Eden was greatly applauded by all the county of Durham for his con|duct, and at his return from parliament was met by 1500 per&s;ons, to congratulate his arrival. This occa&s;ioned the bi&s;hop to call on his dependents and friends to meet him on his coming into the bi&s;hopric, and a cavalcade was formed by many gentlemen, clergymen, and others, on the 23d of January 1723, who attended him into Durham, with about thirty coaches in the train.</P>
<P>The other matter which hurt the bi&s;hop's popularity was, his in&s;inuating to the dean and chapter the room there was for advancing the fines on their lea&s;es; and &s;etting the pernicious example in his own.</P>
<P>In 1725, the bi&s;hop vi&s;ited the dean and chapter, and exhibited articles. He continued in this See till his death, which happened at his hou&s;e in Hanover-&s;quare, London, on the 10th of October 1730, and was buried privately in St James's church, We&s;tmin&s;ter. He was of a magnificent ta&s;te and temper, which often run him into difficulties, his great revenue not being an&s;werable to his expences, and his &s;on was often obliged to extricate him from his embarra&s;&s;ments. After the de|cea&s;e
<PB N="573" REF="632">of his fir&s;t wife, who died without i&s;&s;ue, he entered into a &s;econd marriage with Catharine, daughter of alderman King, of London, by whom he had eight &s;ons and &s;everal daughters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2d, Edward, who was born in the city of Worce&s;ter, and bred at Oriel college in Oxford, where, after taking his fir&s;t degree of arts, he was cho&s;en fellow 30th Oct. 1712.

<P>Bi&s;hop Chandler was a native of Ireland, and chaplain to Lloyd bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter: He was rector of St Nicholas' in Worce&s;ter, and vicar of Prees in the county of Salop. On the 30th of April, 1696, he was nominated to a prebend in Litchfield, void by the death of the reverend Samuel Dugard. On the 21&s;t of October, 1706, then having the degree of doctor in divinity, he was made a pre|bendary of Worce&s;ter; was al&s;o a prebendary of Sarum, and rector of Wem in Shrop&s;hire; and, on the 17th of November 1717, was con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of Litch|field, from whence he was tran&s;lated to Durham at the time before &s;pecified.</P>
<P>He was a very learned and ingenious divine. Among other works of his, the "Defence of Chri&s;tianity, from the Prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament," which he wrote again&s;t Collins, is particularly mentioned. During the time he was engaged in this work, he held a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with the learned Mr William Lowth, with whom he was particularly intimate.</P>

<PB N="575" REF="636">
<P>The See continued vacant near two months, the king being then in Germany. On the 7th of September, JOSEPH BUTLER,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The portrait is copied from an original picture in the committee-room of the Infirmary at Newca&s;tle, painted by Taylor.</NOTE> then bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, was tran&s;lated to this See, and enthroned by proxy on the 9th of November. He was a prelate of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed character and abilities, was born at Wantage in Berk&s;hire, in the year 1692. His father, Mr Thomas Butler, who was a &s;ub&s;tantial and reputable &s;hopkeeper in that town, ob&s;erving in his &s;on Jo&s;eph (who was the younge&s;t of eight children) an excellent genius and inclination for learning, determined to educate him for the mini&s;try, among the prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters of the pre&s;byterian denomination. For this purpo&s;e, after he had gone through a pro|per cour&s;e of grammatical literature, at the free grammar &s;chool of his native place, under the care of the rev. Mr Philip Barton, a clergyman of the church of Eng|land, he was &s;ent to a di&s;&s;enting academy, then kept at Glouce&s;ter, but afterwards removed to Tewke&s;bury, where Mr Butler made an extraordinary progre&s;s in the &s;tudy of divinity; of which he gave a remarkable proof, in the letters addre&s;&s;ed by him to Dr Samuel Clarke, laying before him the doubts that had ari&s;en in his mind, concerning the conclu&s;ivene&s;s of &s;ome arguments in the doctor's "Demon&s;tration of the being and attributes of God." The fir&s;t of the&s;e letters was dated November 4th, 1713; and the &s;agacity and depth of thought di&s;played in it, immediately ex|cited Dr Clarke's particular notice. This conde&s;cen&s;ion encouraged Mr Butler to addre&s;s the doctor again upon the &s;ame &s;ubject; which, likewi&s;e, was an&s;wered by him; and the corre&s;pondence being carried on in three other letters, the whole was
<PB N="576" REF="637">annexed to the celebrated treati&s;e beforementioned, and the collection has been re|tained in all the &s;ub&s;equent editions of that work. The management of this corre&s;|pondence was entru&s;ted by Mr Butler to his friend and fellow pupil Mr Secker, who, in order to conceal the affair, undertook to convey the letters to the po&s;t-of|fice at Glouce&s;ter, and to bring back Dr Clarke's an&s;wers. When Mr Butler's name was di&s;covered to the doctor, the candour, mode&s;ty, and good &s;en&s;e with which he had written, immediately procured him the friend&s;hip of that eminent and ex|cellent man. Our young &s;tudent was not, however, during his continuance at Tewke&s;bury, &s;olely employed in metaphy&s;ical &s;peculations and enquiries. Another &s;ubject of his &s;erious con&s;ideration was, the propriety of his becoming a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter. Accordingly, he entered into an examination of the principles of non|conformity; the re&s;ult of which was, &s;uch a di&s;&s;atisfaction with them, as deter|mined him to conform to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. This intention was at fir&s;t very di&s;agreeable to his father, who endeavoured to divert him from his purpo&s;e; and, with that view, called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome eminent pre&s;byterian divines; but finding his &s;on's re&s;olution to be fixed, he at length &s;uffered him to be removed to Oxford, where he was admitted a commoner of Oriel college on the 17th of March, 1714. At what time he took orders doth not appear, nor who the bi&s;hop was by whom he was ordained; but it is certain, that he entered into the church &s;oon after his admi&s;&s;ion at Oxford, if it be true, as is a&s;&s;erted, that he &s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mr Edward Talbot in the divine &s;ervice, at his living of Hen|dred, near Wantage. With this gentleman, who was the &s;econd &s;on of Dr Wil|liam Talbot, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively bi&s;hop of Oxford, Sali&s;bury, and Durham, Mr Butler formed an intimate friend&s;hip at Oriel college; which friend&s;hip laid the founda|tion of all his &s;ub&s;equent preferments, and procured for him a very honourable &s;ituation, when he was only 26 years of age. For it was in 1718, that, at the re|commendation of Mr Talbot, in conjunction with that of Dr Clarke, he was ap|pointed by Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyll to be preacher at the Rolls. This was three years before he had taken any degree at the univer&s;ity, where he did not go out bachelor of law till the 10th of June, 1721, which, however, was as &s;oon as that degree could &s;tatutably be conferred upon him. Mr Butler continued at the Rolls till 1726, in the beginning of which year he publi&s;hed, in one volume 8yo, fifteen &s;er|mons, preached at that chapel. In the meanwhile, by the patronage of Dr Tal|bot bi&s;hop of Durham, to who&s;e notice he had been recommended, (together with Mr Ben&s;on and Mr Secker) by Mr Edward Talbot, on his death-bed, our author had been pre&s;ented fir&s;t to the rectory of Haughton, near Darlington, and afterwards to that of Stanhope, in the &s;ame dioce&s;e. The benefice of Haughton was given to him in 1722, and that of Stanhope in 1725. At Haughton, there was a nece&s;&s;ity for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He received from the executors of his predece&s;&s;or Richard Bella&s;&s;y&s;e, for dilapidations, 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> as appears by the following original receipt, now in Mr Allan's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: &mdash; <Q>Augu&s;t 25, 1722. I Jo&s;eph Butler, &startq;rector of Haughton, do promi&s;e Mr Thomas Bella&s;&s;y&s;e a full di&s;charge of all dilapidations belonging to &endq;the rectory of Haughton, upon his payment of the &s;um of &s;ixty pounds. <HI>Jo&s;. Butler.</HI></Q> Te&s;t. M. Nel&s;on. This &s;um he expended, together with a further &s;um in providing materials for rebuilding the &s;aid par&s;onage-hou&s;e. The&s;e, on his removal to Stanhope, were taken by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Mr Thorpe, wherewith he in part repaired the pre&s;ent par&s;onage.</NOTE> rebuilding a great part of the par&s;onage-hou&s;e, and Mr Butler had
<PB N="577" REF="638">neither money nor talents for that work. Mr Secker, therefore, who had al|ways the intere&s;t of his friends at heart, and had acquired a very con&s;iderable in|fluence with bi&s;hop Talbot, per&s;uaded that prelate to give Mr Butler, in exchange for Haughton, the rectory of Stanhope; which was not only free from any &s;uch incumbrance, but was likewi&s;e of much &s;uperior value, being indeed, at that time, one of the riche&s;t par&s;onages in England. Whil&s;t our author continued preacher at the Rolls chapel, he divided his time between his duty in town and country; but when he quitted the Rolls, he re&s;ided, during &s;even years, wholly at Stanhope, in the con&s;cientious di&s;charge of every obligation appertaining to a good pari&s;h prie&s;t. This retirement, however, was too &s;olitary for his di&s;po&s;ition, which had in it a natural ca&s;t of gloomine&s;s; and though his reclu&s;e hours were by no means lo&s;t either to private improvement or public utility, yet he felt at times, very painfully, the want of that &s;elect &s;ociety of friends, to which he had been accu&s;tomed, and which could in&s;pire him with the greate&s;t chearfulne&s;s. Mr Secker, therefore, who knew this, was extremely anxious to draw him out into a more active and con&s;picious &s;cene, and omitted no opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing this de&s;ire to &s;uch as he thought capable of promoting it. Having him&s;elf been appointed king's chap|lain in 1732, he took occa&s;ion, in a conver&s;ation which he had the honour of hold|ing with queen Caroline, to mention to her his friend Mr Butler. The queen &s;aid, &s;he thought he had been dead: Mr Secker a&s;&s;ured her he was not. Yet her maje&s;|ty afterwards a&s;ked archbi&s;hop Blackburne, if he was not dead? His an&s;wer was, "no, madam, but he is buried." Mr Secker continuing his purpo&s;e of endeavouring to bring his friend out of his retirement, found means, upon Mr Charles Talbot's being made lord chancellor, to have Mr Butler recommended to him for his chap|lain. His lord&s;hip accepted, and &s;ent for him; and this promotion calling him to town, he took Oxford in his way, and was admitted there to the degree of doctor of law, on the 8th of December 1733. The lord chancellor, who gave him al&s;o a prebend in the church of Roche&s;ter, had con&s;ented that he &s;hould re&s;ide at his pa|ri&s;h of Stanhope one half of the year.</P>
<P>Dr Butler being thus brought back into the world, his merit and talents &s;oon introduced him to particular notice, and paved the way for his ri&s;ing to tho&s;e high dignities which he afterwards enjoyed. In 1736, he was appointed clerk of the clo&s;et to queen Caroline; and, in the &s;ame year, he pre&s;ented to her maje&s;ty a co|py of his excellent treati&s;e, entitled, "The analogy of religion, natural and re|vealed, to the con&s;titution and cour&s;e of nature." His attendance upon his royal mi&s;tr$&s;s, by her e&s;pecial command, was from &s;even to nine in the evening every day; and though this particular relation to that excellent and learned queen was &s;oon determined by her death in 1737, yet he had been &s;o effectually recommended by her, as well as by the late lord chancellor Talbot, to his maje&s;ty's favour, that, in the next year, he was rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t order of the church, by a nomination to the bi&s;hopric of Bri&s;tol; to which See he was con&s;ecrated on the 3d of Decem|ber 1738. King George II. not being &s;atisfied with this proof of his regard to Dr Butler, promoted him, in 1740, to the deanry of St Paul's, London; into which he was in&s;talled on the 24th of May in that year. Finding the demands of this dig|nity
<PB N="578" REF="639">to be incompatible with his pari&s;h duty at Stanhope, he immediately re&s;igned that benefice. Be&s;ides our prelate's unremitted attention to his peculiar obliga|tions, he was called upon to preach &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es on public occa&s;ions, which were afterwards printed, and have &s;ince been annexed to the latter editions of the &s;ermons at the Rolls chapel. In 1746, upon the death of Dr Egerton bi&s;hop of Hereford, Dr Butler was made clerk of the clo&s;et to the king; and he in 1750, received another di&s;tingui&s;hed mark of his maje&s;ty's favour, by being tran&s;lated to the See of Durham. This was on the 16th of October in that year, upon the de|cea&s;e of Dr Edward Chandler. Our prelate, being thus appointed to pre&s;ide over a dioce&s;e with which he had long been connected, delivered his fir&s;t, and, indeed, his la&s;t charge to his clergy, at his primary vi&s;itation in 1751. The principal &s;ub|ject of it was, "Eternal religion."</P>
<P>By his promotion to the See of Durham, our worthy bi&s;hop was furni&s;hed with ample means of exerting the virtue of charity; a virtue which eminently abounded in him, and the exerci&s;e of which was his highe&s;t delight. But this gratification he did not long enjoy: He had been but a &s;hort time &s;eated in his new bi&s;hopric, when his health began vi&s;ibly to decline; and having been complimented, during his indi&s;po&s;ition, upon account of his great re&s;ignation to the divine will, he is &s;aid to have expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome regret that he &s;hould be taken from the pre&s;ent world &s;o &s;oon after he had been rendered capable of becoming much more u&s;eful in it. In his la&s;t illne&s;s, he was carried to Bri&s;tol, to try the waters of that place; but the&s;e proving ineffectual, he removed to Bath, where, being pa&s;t recovery, he died on the 16th of June 1752. His corp&s;e was conveyed to Bri&s;tol, and interred in the cathedral there, where a monument is erected to his memory.</P>
<P>On the greatne&s;s of bi&s;hop Butler's intellectual character we need not enlarge; for his profound knowledge, and the prodigious &s;trength of his mind, are amply di&s;played in his incomparable writings. He was of a mo&s;t reverend a&s;pect: His face thin and pale; but there was a divine placidne&s;s in his countenance, which in|&s;pired veneration, and expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t benevolent mind: His white hair hung gracefully on his &s;houlders, and his whole figure was patriarchal. Officiating in the epi&s;copal duties of the church whil&s;t bi&s;hop of Durham, he gave a &s;triking ex|ample of piety and holy &s;olemnity, which was of the mo&s;t &s;erious and fervent, and perhaps &s;omewhat of the a&s;cetic kind. His benevolence was warm, generous, and di&s;&s;u&s;ive. Whil&s;t he was bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, he expended, in repairing and im|proving the epi&s;copal palace, 4000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which is &s;aid to have been more than the whole revenues of the bi&s;hopric amounted to during his continuance in that See. In the year 1752, he began to make great alterations in and about the ca&s;tle at Durham, by pulling down the old tape&s;try hangings in the dining-room, and &s;tuccoing the wall with ornaments below the cornice, adding &s;ome foliages on the joining of the compartments of the roof. He enlarged and put in new Gothic windows to the north. He al&s;o took down and rebuilt a con&s;iderable part of the out&s;ide wall of the ca&s;tle at the north door (where his arms are placed) and which overhung the perpendicular line &s;everal inches; new floored the great we&s;t dining-room above &s;tairs, and new-&s;tuccoed and floored the judges apartments, and put new fire-places
<PB N="579" REF="640">therein. He al&s;o pulled down and rebuilt the ea&s;tern wall of the bowling-green at Auckland, and made great improvements in the park there, by levelling, plant|ing, and de&s;troying all the rabbits in it; and de&s;igned to add about 130 acres thereto, having actually begun to pale part of &s;uch new inclo&s;ure. Be&s;ides his private benefactions, he contributed 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the Infirmary at Bri&s;tol, and was a &s;ub&s;criber to three of the ho&s;pitals at London. He was likewi&s;e a principal pro|moter, though not the fir&s;t founder, of the Infirmary at Newca&s;tle, to which he gave 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> In &s;upporting the ho&s;pitality and dignity of the rich and powerful dio|ce&s;e of Durham, he was de&s;irous of imitating the &s;pirit of his patron bi&s;hop Talbot. In this &s;pirit, he &s;et apart three days every week for the reception and entertainment of the principal gentry of the country. Nor were even the clergy who had the poore&s;t benefices neglected by him. He not only occa&s;ionally invited them to dine with him, but conde&s;cended to vi&s;it them at their re&s;pective pari&s;hes. By his will, he left 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel in foreign parts, and &s;ome legacies to his friends and dome&s;tics. His chaplain, the rev. Dr Nathaniel For&s;ter, was his executor, a divine of di&s;tingui&s;hed literature. Bi&s;hop Butler was never mar|ried. Soon after his decea&s;e, the following lines, by way of epitaph, were writ|ten concerning him; and were printed fir&s;t, if we recollect right, in the London Magazine.</P>

His lord&s;hip was born the 30th of September 1707; was fir&s;t placed at Bi&s;hop-Stortford &s;chool in Hertford&s;hire, and, when of &s;ufficient age, removed to We&s;t|min&s;ter, where he &s;taid till ripe for the univer&s;ity; was entered a gentleman com|moner of Queen's college, Oxford, and had for his tutor Jo&s;eph Stedman, fellow of the &s;ame college; from hence elected fellow of All Souls in 1727, where he took his ma&s;ter of arts degree, 28th of January 1731; was pre&s;ented, by Sir Ro|bert Barnard, to the valuable living of Houghton with Witton, in the county of Huntington, 1732; &s;ucceeded Dr Thomas Terry (who died at Bath in 1735) in his canonry of Chri&s;t-Church, Oxford, and, on the 10th of June 1736, pro|ceeded to the degree of doctor of the civil law, for which he went out (as the term is) grand compounder. In January, 1744, he was appointed, by his late maje&s;ty, bi&s;hop of St David's, on the promotion of Dr Edward Willes to the See of Bath and Wells; from thence he was tran&s;lated to Durham, 9th of November 1752, and there enthroned by proxy on the 29th of December following.</P>

To attain this honourable &s;ta|tion, he was &s;purred on more by the advice and importunity of his friends, than by his own natural temper and inclination.

<P>There was a &s;ingular dignity in his lord&s;hip's per&s;on; he was tall, well propor|tioned, and of a carriage erect and &s;tately. The epi&s;copal robe was never worn more gracefully. His features were regular, manly, and expre&s;&s;ive; his complex|ion florid, and over his countenance was diffu&s;ed an air of benignity, though ac|companied with that pre&s;ence, which, whil&s;t it in&s;pired e&s;teem, commanded reve|rence and di&s;tant re&s;pect.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip re&s;ided all the &s;ummer months either at Durham or Auckland, but chiefly at the latter, where he made great improvements in the ca&s;tle and park; u&s;ed much exerci&s;e in walking, and enjoyed a good &s;tate of health until the year 1771.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account was &s;ound among the papers of Mr Robert Hutchin&s;on, (brother to the author, and one of his lord&s;hip's dome&s;tics, who de&s;igned the prefixed portrait) and which di&s;covers &s;uch a noble fortitude of mind at the approach of his di&s;&s;olution, as could be in&s;pired only by a clear conference, and the calm re|tro&s;pect of an uninter$upted &s;eries of virtue.</NOTE> About the 10th day of March in that year, he began to be confined; a gangrene fore having attacked the tendons of his left foot, and a mortification of the mo&s;t fatal kind en&s;ued; the toes &s;loughed off one after another, by a &s;low but irre&s;i&s;tible progre&s;s; every aid of medicine, and all that human art could do, was mo&s;t a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly as well as judiciou&s;ly admini&s;tered by tho&s;e two eminent &s;urgeons, Drs Ad|dington and Hawkins; nor could any thing tend more to a&s;&s;i&s;t the endeavours of tho&s;e gentlemen, than the &s;ingularly prudent and compo&s;ed behaviour of their pa|tient,
<PB N="582" REF="644">who, during his whole confinement, took every medicine, and &s;uffered every pain, with that firm compo&s;ure of mind, which, by a &s;trong and happy influence, a&s;&s;i&s;ts the operations of nature. The bark was taken as long and in as large quan|tities as ever known, and &s;eemed to agree &s;o well with his con&s;titution, that, if the di&s;ea&s;e had been remediable, that alone would have effected a cure; but it was too malignant and inveterate, and had already taken a mortal hold on the whole habit. After having &s;uffered, above two months, a copious di&s;charge from the wound be|low, and, as one &s;hould think, in &s;ome mea&s;ure corrected by &s;o long an ab&s;orption of anti&s;eptic medicines, a new-fore, tending to a carbuncle, appeared on his back: This gave a damp to all hopes, and nothing remained but the dread of a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence being too far prolonged: Henceforward it might be &s;aid, <HI>Que&s;itaeque nocent artes, ce&s;&s;ere magi&s;tri.</HI> The poi&s;on now began gradually to creep up from the foot (already mortified) to the leg. As, on the one hand, life was incompati|ble with &s;uch a ma&s;s, &s;o, on the other, amputation, in his then habit of body and great weakne&s;s, afforded no other po&s;&s;ible pro&s;pect but to embitter the conflict and ha&s;ten the event.</P>
<P>In this helple&s;s &s;ituation did the bi&s;hop lie above twelve weeks, the latter part of which he did not &s;uffer much pain, except when his foot or back were dre&s;t. The unea&s;ine&s;s of his po&s;ture, which admitted of no variety, mu&s;t have grown intolera|ble; I &s;ay mu&s;t, becau&s;e we are to judge of his feelings from our rea&s;on, not from his expre&s;&s;ion of them; for neither the&s;e nor his other &s;ufferings (and others he had) ever drew from him a peevi&s;h word, melancholy ejaculation, or a de&s;ponding &s;igh. As long as his &s;trength permitted, he &s;at up in his chair. Though he had no appetite, yet he continued to have a regular dinner, and two or three of his friends to dine with him. In &s;hort, he &s;tudied to conceal as much as po&s;&s;ible the appearance of a &s;ick man, and till within two days of his death, ought rather to have been called a wounded man; for though in fact the poi&s;on was every minute gaining ground, yet, wonderful to relate! it neither cau&s;ed fever, head-ach, or any painful &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>His throat, for the la&s;t ten days, became &s;ore and ulcerated: Though the &s;pirits which depend upon the &s;trength dimini&s;hed with his &s;trength, yet the firmne&s;s and tranquillity of his mind never &s;uffered any change. He frequently took notice of that concern in the countenances of his friends and dome&s;tics, which they could not conceal, and he as often chid them for it. It was &s;uppo&s;ed he had but a bad opinion of his ca&s;e from the fir&s;t, having executed his will the 9th of April 1771, and it was evident he di&s;covered the full extent of his calamity: But it was not the lea&s;t of his philo&s;ophy to conceal the&s;e feelings, whil&s;t he inwardly prepared him&s;elf for the awful &s;cene he perceived was now approaching; how admirably he effected this, tho&s;e that were &s;pectators can bear te&s;timony.</P>
<P>On Saturday morning the 8th of June, the bi&s;hop, from &s;ome inward feelings, be|came more &s;en&s;ible of his approaching di&s;&s;olution; he no more &s;uffered him&s;elf to be taken up; and de&s;ired Dr Yorke, then bi&s;hop of St David's and mini&s;ter of his pari&s;h, might be &s;ent for to admini&s;ter the facrament to him the following evening. The weakne&s;s of his &s;ituation, and fear of an approaching delirium, &s;hewed the impro|priety
<PB N="583" REF="645">of po&s;tponing the ceremony &s;o long. Lord Trevor told his brother, that the bi&s;hop of St David's was not in town; but that his chaplain Mr De&s;alis was then ready, and begged to have the &s;atisfaction of communicating with him immediate|ly. The bi&s;hop &s;aid, he believed things were not &s;o pre&s;&s;ing; but however, if he He al&s;o de&s;ired that his nephew (Mr John Trevor, a young gentleman of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing character, and who had attended him with the mo&s;t &s;ingular affection and a&s;&s;iduity) together with the re&s;t of the family, might communicate with him: The ceremony was accordingly performed; and the bi&s;hop was the only per&s;on who, during this awful &s;olemnity, was moved by no other affections than tho&s;e of pure devotion. When this was over, he continued to lie in perfect ea&s;e of body, and &s;till more perfect compo&s;ure of mind. He de&s;ired lord Trevor and his nephew would &s;it by him, &s;aid &s;omething about &s;ettling his affairs, and gave directions about his burial; expre&s;&s;ed the happine&s;s he had experienced in lord Trevors long and cordial friend&s;hip, gave thanks to God for the re&s;ignation and fortitude with which he had been enabled to bear his afflictions, and thanked the world for the kind &s;hare of concern it had taken in his &s;ituation. He al&s;o talked &s;ome time very &s;eri|ou&s;ly with Mr John Trevor; told him, <HI>that he believed he was not immediately going, but that he had then put him&s;elf in the po&s;ture in which he &s;hould wi&s;h to be ready when it plea&s;ed Providence to &s;trike.</HI> He then de&s;ired the family to go to dinner, bidding the &s;ervants take particular care of his friends, and leave him as u&s;ual to go to re&s;t. All Saturday evening and night he continued to re&s;t quietly, though &s;light and par|tial convul&s;ions began to affect his arms and &s;ingers. He now and then had his mouth moi&s;tened, but no more took any medicines or &s;olid food; de&s;ired that he might be prayed for the next morning in his pari&s;h church of St George. On Sunday morning he appeared much the &s;ame; but after the la&s;t dre&s;&s;ing of his wounds, which was made as ea&s;y and &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, he grew much weaker, but &s;till continued ea&s;y and perfectly &s;en&s;ible, except when convul&s;ions came on, which now began to be more frequent and violent: He had four fits before evening; about &s;ix, being more quiet and perfectly &s;en&s;ible, he de&s;ired the prayers for the &s;ick might be read to him, to which he repeated all the re&s;pon&s;es; but feeling another &s;it coming on, &s;topped the prayers; recovering therefrom, he fell a&s;leep, and continued &s;o till &s;hook by more convultions, and had &s;even or eight after this, at intervals of about half an hour; &s;till his &s;en&s;es were unaffected. He &s;aid to Mr John Trevor after one of the &s;its, <HI>Jack, you &s;ee me clinging to life much more than it de&s;erves.</HI> About eleven at night, he a&s;ked the apothecary how he did; and the&s;e were the la&s;t words he uttered. While he continued to lie in an horizontal po&s;ture, he breathed with difficulty and unea&s;ine&s;s, and made a &s;ign to be rai&s;ed a little, which when done, he continued for about ten minutes to breathe away the la&s;t re|mains of life almo&s;t impereeptibly, without a &s;truggle or a groan. At a quarter before twelve he expired (June 9, 1771) in the 64th year of his age, and of his tran&s;lation the 19th.</P>
<P>Thus at length was this excellent man relea&s;ed from all his &s;uff$$ings. leaving behind him an example of chri&s;tian piety, fortitude, and re&s;ignation, which no hu|man
<PB N="584" REF="646">being ever exceeded, and few have equalled. On the 19th of June, he was buried privately, (according to his own directions) at Glynd in Su&s;&s;ex, which church he rebuilt, and gave thirteen acres of land to the vicar and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever.</P>
<P>To draw the character of this reverend prelate requires the able&s;t pen.

A. rector of Houghton-le-Spring, in the county of Durham.</NOTE> compo&s;er being above di&s;pute, and his intimacy with the bi|&s;hop &s;ufficiently known.</P>
<P>"Seldom have &s;o many amiable and valuable qualities met together in one per|&s;on; &s;eldom have virtues and accompli&s;hments been &s;o happily united as in the late bi&s;hop of Durham. If we con&s;ider him in private life, we &s;hall find none more worthy of our love; if in public, none that could more ju&s;tly claim our ve|neration and e&s;teem.</P>
<P>His per&s;onal accompli&s;hments were &s;uch as could not fail to attract the notice, and win the regard of all with whom he conver&s;ed. His tenderne&s;s to tho&s;e who had the happine&s;s of being near him, was beyond example; which nece&s;&s;arily at|tached to him more by affection than by any other bond of authority, intere&s;t, or &s;ear, every feeling heart, capable of gratitude, and alive to the impre&s;&s;ions of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>His attainments in literature far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his own mode&s;t e&s;timate of them. His acquaintance with the hi&s;tory both of ancient and modern times was accurate and exten&s;ive. He was ma&s;ter of the be&s;t and pure&s;t writers of antiquity, and his memory was &s;tored with their fine&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, which he applied with propriety and ta&s;te; whil&s;t he felt and communicated the &s;ublimer beauties of the &s;acred books with &s;uch energy and warmth of expre&s;&s;ion, as &s;hewed that their divine fires touch|ed his heart.</P>
<P>His knowledge of the affairs of men, and di&s;cernment of characters, &s;poke one who had been accu&s;tomed to read mankind with penetration and candour.</P>
<P>From the&s;e accompli&s;hments of the head and heart flowed a conver&s;ation plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive, which had all the &s;trength that ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, &s;entiment, and deep reflection could give, accompanied by all the graces that it could derive from an open and engaging countenance, a winning addre&s;s, harmonious elocution, a language copious, correct, and natural, and a mind elegantly turned.</P>
<P>In a word, in private life we &s;aw accompli&s;hments &s;upported by worth; poli&s;hed manners and a plea&s;ing form animated by intelligence and goodne&s;s of heart; out|wardly, all that was graceful and becoming, whil&s;t all was light and peace within.</P>
<P>His public character was &s;uch as did naturally re&s;ult from &s;o many private virtues and amiable endowments. The true intrin&s;ic worth which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, ea&s;ily took an outward poli&s;h beyond what any art can give to ba&s;er materials.</P>
<P>He wore his temporal honors with dignity and ea&s;e. Never were the &s;hining qua|lities of the Palatine more ju&s;tly tempered by the milder graces of the Dioce&s;an.</P>
<PB N="585" REF="647">
<P>Liberality, munificence, and greatne&s;s of mind flowing from one &s;ource, were hap|pily united with meekne&s;s, moderation, and humility derived from the other.</P>
<P>Inve&s;ted with high authority, his influence, which was become general and ex|ten&s;ive, &s;eemed not &s;o much the effect of power, as the re&s;ult of rea&s;on and &s;upe|rior ability exerted for the public good.</P>
<P>He was &s;incerely and firmly attached to every thing that is excellent in our hap|py con&s;titution; wi&s;hing to &s;ee public authority and private liberty &s;tanding toge ther on the ba&s;is of public law; and public peace e&s;tabli&s;hed by their concord.</P>
<P>A friend from principle to the intere&s;ts of the church of England, his zeal for its welfare was directed by knowledge, and tempered by &s;entiments of pure&s;t cha|rity towards all our di&s;&s;enting brethren; which he expre&s;&s;ed not only in private con|ver&s;ation, but in his public di&s;cour&s;es, particularly in his la&s;t affectionate addre&s;s to the clergy of his dioce&s;e, delivered at his final vi&s;itation in July and Augu&s;t 1770.</P>
<P>Ea&s;y of acce&s;s to all, he was ever open to his clergy, and ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them by his council and advice, or, where the ca&s;e required it, by liberal contributions. Their complaints and grievances were received by him as into the bo&s;om of a friend, and for them he had no authority but that of a parent. Among&s;t them, he was much more &s;tudious to find out merit, and di&s;tingui&s;h good behaviour, than ready to remark or remember errors and failings.</P>
<P>Under every change of times, and through all the affairs both of public and pri|vate life, he maintained a &s;teady cour&s;e, regular, uniform, and con&s;i&s;tent. His mea&s;ures were not taken from occa&s;ional &s;ituations, from wavering inclination, or con&s;iderations of pre&s;ent convenience. He acted on principles by their nature fixed and unchangeable. Religion had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his foul, and all his rules of conduct were tran&s;cribed into his heart from the royal law of chri&s;tian charity: Therefore was his brea&s;t filled with candour, integrity, and truth; and therefore did he maintain a firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy, which they who proceed on principles of fal&s;e honour or worldly policy, mu&s;t admire but cannot equal.</P>
<P>His conceptions of the doctrines and de&s;ign of chri&s;tianity were noble and exalt|ed: He felt their power, and wondered that it was not univer&s;ally &s;elt. How hath my &s;oul been enflamed when I have heard his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject warm from his benevolent heart! "We may boa&s;t our&s;elves," he would &s;ay, "in the ad|vancement we have made in the theory of our religion; but how mu&s;t our pride be humbled when we compare our practice with our theory! Surely principles &s;o great and glorious as tho&s;e of the go&s;pel, &s;o full of the &s;eeds of all ble&s;&s;ings to hu|man &s;ociety, cannot always remain without their effect. No.&mdash;Revelation may be &s;low in working the &s;ull purpo&s;e of Heaven, but it mu&s;t be &s;ure. Religion mu&s;t one day be a very different thing from what we at pre&s;ent behold it: Chri&s;tian charity cannot always be to the world a light without heat, a pale cold &s;ire. Its warmth at length mu&s;t be univer&s;ally felt. The time mu&s;t come, when our zeal &s;hall ap|pear to be kindled by this heavenly &s;ire, and not by human pa&s;&s;ion; when all our little earthly heats be extingui&s;hed, and that pure and divine &s;lame alone &s;hall burn. The time will come, when animo&s;ity and violence, and rage &s;hall cea&s;e; and when union, love and harmony &s;hall prevail. The time will come, when earth &s;hall bear a nearer re&s;emblance to heaven." May his &s;pirit be prophetie! May tho&s;e

<ITEM><LABEL>Temporal chancellor,</LABEL> Sir Jo&s;eph Yates, knt. one of the judges of the K. B appointed Feb. 1765.&mdash; He was one of tho&s;e who very early in life attached him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of our laws, not as the generality of &s;tudents do, either from the appointments of parents, or the mere motives of drawing pecuniary re&s;ources from the profe&s;&s;ion, but from the more liberal principle of informing him&s;elf in a &s;cience, which only appeared im|portant to him from being capable of defending the lives and properties of indivi|duals. With this open and enlarged turn of mind, he pur&s;ued his enquiries with a per&s;everance and preci&s;ion almo&s;t peculiar to him&s;elf, till the profe&s;&s;ion repaid him by &s;toring his mind with an univer&s;al knowledge of its laws, which very rare|ly falls to the lot of the greate&s;t talents, or mo&s;t diligent re&s;earches: His invinci|ble mode&s;ty, however, repelled him the notice of the public for many years, till at la&s;t the repeated ju&s;tne&s;s of his opinions and forcibility of his pleadings pro|cured him a coif, from whence he was &s;oon afterwards promoted to be one of the judges of the King's Bench. In this character he always conducted him&s;elf with a dignity and impartiality that reflected honour even on that re&s;pectable &s;ituation. The right of the &s;ubject and dignity of the crown were never occa&s;ionally explain|ed by will or favouriti&s;m, but by the e&s;tabli&s;hed language of the law; and a &s;teady impartial ob&s;ervance of it formed the invariable rule of his conduct.&mdash;His char|ges to juries were not the charges of an A&s;iatic Cadi delivering his own will, but the charges of a Briti&s;h Judge in the land of liberty, and will be remembered for many years with plea&s;ure by the lovers of freedom and oratory. In the&s;e he ap|peared more the guardian of the people than an officer of the crown; and hit that nice medium, as a di&s;tributor of ju&s;tice, &s;o &s;trictly, that the offending party, whil&s;t they felt the cha&s;ti&s;ement, could not help applauding the cha&s;ti&s;er.&mdash;Though uni|ver&s;al in his knowledge of the laws, his <HI>forte</HI> confe&s;&s;edly lay in common pleadings, with which he was more minutely acquainted than any man of his time. Sen&s;ible that his talents drew him more &s;trongly this way, he, on the re&s;ignation of judge Clive, &s;olicited to change from the King's Bench to the Common Pleas, wherein he &s;ucceeded, but which he did not long live to enjoy; his death, in 1770, de|priving the world of one of the greate&s;t judges of that court England perhaps ever boa&s;ted of.</ITEM>

He died a bachelor the 12th of March, 1780, aet. 80; and was buried at Barton, in the North-Riding of the county of York, where an elegant monu|ment is placed, with the following in&s;cription:
<Q>Near this Wall is interred THOMAS GYLL, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR> Equally e&s;teemed for his knowledge of the Common and Canon Law, and for his Integrity in the practice of both. At the Bar an Advocate in the former, On the Bench a Judge in the latter. Nor was he le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for his Accuracy in the Hi&s;tory and Antiquities of his Country. By a &s;teady di&s;charge of the duties of his Station both in public and private life, and by a con&s;tant and devout attendance on the public Wor&s;hip, he was an example worthy of imitation. He died in his 80th year MDCCLXXX. To the Memory of his truly valuable character, Leonard Hartley his nephew and heir placed this Tablet.</Q></ITEM>

He was not given to wine; he was no &s;triker, nor greedy of filthy lucre, but patient; not a brawler, not covetous. He ruled well his own hou&s;e, having his family in &s;ubjection with all gravity; for if a man knows not how to rule his own hou&s;e, how &s;hall he take care of the church of God? He was neither a novice, nor lifted up with pride; and moreover, he had a good report of them which are without, &s;o that he was free from all reproach.</HI>"</P>
