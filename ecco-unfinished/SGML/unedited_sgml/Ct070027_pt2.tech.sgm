<P>THE following Poem is formed on a very
&s;ingular and &s;ublime idea. A young gen|tleman,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an uncommon genius for draw|ing,
on vi&s;iting the Tower of London, pa&s;&s;ing one
door of a &s;ingular con&s;truction, a&s;ked what apart|ment
it led to, and expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to have it
opened. The per&s;on who &s;hewed the place &s;hook
his head, and an&s;wered, &startq;Heaven knows what is
within that door&mdash;it has been &s;hut for ages.&endq;&mdash;
This an&s;wer made &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion on the other
hearers, but a very deep one on the imagination of
<PB REF="24">
this youth. Gracious Heaven! an apartment &s;hut
up for ages&mdash;and in the Tower!</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Ye Towers of Julius! London's la&s;ting &s;hame,</L>
<L>By many a foul and midnight murder fed.&endq;.</L></Q>
<P>Genius builds on a &s;light foundation, and rears
beautiful &s;tructures on &startq;the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi|&s;ion.&endq;.
The above tran&s;ient hint dwelt on the
young man's fancy, and conjured into his memory
all the murders which hi&s;tory records to have been
committed in the Tower; Henry the Sixth, the
Duke of Clarence, the two young princes, &s;ons of
Edward the Fourth, Sir Thomas Overbury, &amp;c.
He &s;uppo&s;es all their gho&s;ts a&s;&s;embled in this unex|plored
apartment, and to the&s;e his fertile imagina|tion
has added &s;everal others. One of the &s;pectres
<PB REF="25">
rai&s;es an immen&s;e pall of black velvet, and di&s;covers
the remains of a murdered royal family, who&s;e &s;tory
is lo&s;t in the lap&s;e of time.&mdash;The gloomy wildne&s;s
of the&s;e images &s;truck my imagination &s;o forcibly,
that endeavouring to catch the fire of the youth's
pencil, this Fragment was produced.</P>

would ill &s;atisfy, it is nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint them,
that the author has not had the pre&s;umption even to
attempt a full, hi&s;torical narration of the fall of the
Peruvian empire. To de&s;cribe that important event
with accuracy, and to di&s;play with clearne&s;s and
force the various cau&s;es which combined to produce
it, would require all the energy of genius, and the
mo&s;t glowing colours of imagination. Con&s;cious
