<P>_NEVER were People more infatuated, and more iudu&s;triou&s;ly con|triving each others Ru|in, than the Inhabitants of this unhappy I&s;land. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who formerly were a Terror to their Enemies, and a Supporter of their Friends and Allies, are now become Foes to none but them&s;elves, and de&s;troyers of their own Happine&s;s.
<PB N="2" REF="3">
But what adds more to this mi&s;|fortune, is, that &s;o great mi&s;chief &s;hould be occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e two Trifling and In&s;ignificant words of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory;</HI> Names invented in Hell, and &s;pread about this King|dom to brand Hone&s;t Men with o|dious Characters, and turn the whole Nation into Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Etymology of the&s;e Names, carries in it both <HI>Ill Nature</HI> and <HI>Scan|dal;</HI> and as we apply them to each other with all the <HI>Bitterne&s;s</HI> and <HI>In|famy,</HI> we can, &s;o we very well an|&s;wer their Signification. I did call them <HI>in&s;ignificant</HI> Names, and in one Sen&s;e they are; for tho' they have a <HI>Signification,</HI> yet their Natural <HI>Mean|ing,</HI> which I &s;hall immediately make pear, is <HI>Poor, Beggarly,</HI> and <HI>Villainous,</HI> to Men of <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> and <HI>Hone&s;ty;</HI> and none but <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Knaves</HI> will em|brace the Di&s;tinction, and take ei|ther of the&s;e Characters.</P>
<P>The Former of the&s;e <HI>excellent</HI> Names, according to the be&s;t Infor|mation, that I can get, and 'tis no great matter, whether it is true or fal&s;e, comes from <HI>Scotland,</HI> which &s;ignifies a &s;ort of <HI>Butter-Milk</HI> or
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<HI>Whey;</HI> which is the wor&s;t Part of the <HI>Milk,</HI> that is left after <HI>Butter,</HI> or <HI>Chee&s;e,</HI> is made.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Butter-Milk,</HI> it has a very Sower Ta&s;t, not unlike the pre&s;ent Temper of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> for when a <HI>Whig</HI> and a <HI>Tory</HI> meet together, they look as Sower upon one another as &s;o many <HI>Crab-Trees;</HI> And their Di&s;|cour&s;e, if they happen to confabu|late, has as much Sweetne&s;s in it, as the Juice of tho&s;e Apples, which the above&s;aid Trees produce; &s;o that <HI>by their Fruit you may know them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Latin</HI> words for a <HI>Whig</HI> are <HI>Homo Fanaticus, Homo Factio&s;us.</HI> The former, according to <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Phi|lander</HI>'s Glo&s;&s;ary, &s;ignifies a Man that is <HI>Mad, Frantick,</HI> or <HI>Fanatick;</HI> The Latter <HI>Factious, Mutinous,</HI> and <HI>Rebellious.</HI> Words exceedingly well adapted for <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> and <HI>Scandal,</HI> and of great u&s;e to Blacken Mens Reputa|tion.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e <HI>Whigi&s;m</HI> according to the &s;ame Language is call'd <HI>Enthu|&s;ia&s;mus</HI> and <HI>Perduellio.</HI> The former is agreeable to the word <HI>Fanaticus,</HI> and according to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Interpreters, &s;ignifies a <HI>Spiritual Mad|ne&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
or a <HI>vain Pretence</HI> to <HI>Divine In|&s;piration;</HI> &s;uch as the late <HI>French Pro|phets</HI> aim'd at, and the good <HI>tolera|ted</HI> People, now call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> pretend to have. This by way of Analogy is put for all manner of Madne&s;s; and when the Epithet <HI>Whigi&s;h</HI> is an|nex'd to the Sub&s;tantive <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> it means then <HI>Political Madne&s;s.</HI> The latter Word <HI>Perduellio</HI> explains the Word <HI>Faction,</HI> in a very bad Sen&s;e, and &s;ignifies <HI>High-Trea&s;on</HI> a|gain&s;t Prince and State, according to <HI>Cicero, Livy</HI> and other Authors. This is charging Men with the highe&s;t Crimes, that malice can in|vent, or Human Nature can be guilty of. And therefore they, who keep up &s;uch Di&s;tinctions, de&s;erve neither the Name of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> nor a <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> they are only a Pe&s;t to the Nation, and by &s;preading their Infection, their Contagious Di&s;temper, like a Canker, will eat us up and con&s;ume us in Time.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides all this Rancour and Malice, with which they treat Men, who are unju&s;tly Stigmatiz'd with the Name of <HI>Whig.</HI> This word al|&s;o contains in it a <HI>Flout</HI> and a <HI>Jeer,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
unworthy to be ca&s;t upon any Man, that has Sen&s;e and Wit enough, together with his Honour and Hone&s;ty, to be engaged in Go|vernment. For as the word <HI>Whig</HI> &s;ignifies Sower <HI>Butter-Milk,</HI> &s;o it al&s;o comprehends <HI>Whey,</HI> which is nothing but the <HI>Water</HI> of the <HI>Milk,</HI> that is left after the Chee&s;e is made; and carrys with it a very Flat and In&s;ipid Ta&s;t. This is only in plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to call wi&s;e Men <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Blockheads,</HI> and when &s;uch opprobrious and pernicious Names &s;hall be publickly applied by a vile &s;ort of People, to reach tho&s;e by who&s;e Council and Laws we are to be rul'd, and this go off with Im|punity, Government will at la&s;t be brought into Contempt, and the Nation to Ruin and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Nor does the Word <HI>Tory</HI> carry in it le&s;s Venom and Malice, it bear|ing no better an Explanation than that of a <HI>Bog-Trotter,</HI> or <HI>Iri&s;h Robber;</HI> a Fellow that lives by <HI>Vagrancy,</HI> and upon the <HI>Spoils</HI> he takes from Hone&s;t Men. So that according to the Etymology of the Word, he that is a <HI>Tory,</HI> will &s;tick at no manner of
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Wickedne&s;s to enrich him&s;elf, and what&s;oever he lays his Hand upon, 'tis his own. He was to bring in the <HI>Pretender,</HI> if he could have got any thing by it, and to have kept our Pre&s;ent <HI>Sovereign</HI> from his Crown and Kingdom, which were his ju&s;t and lawful Right, and all this to have carried on his own Private Intere&s;t. Thief-like he was to rob the Nation of what he could, and live upon the common Plunder. This I take to be the Litteral Sen&s;e of a <HI>Tory,</HI> or an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Robber.</P>
<P>And now what a woful Con|dition is Poor <HI>England</HI> reduced to, that according to this odious di&s;tin|ction &s;he has not one Hone&s;t Man left; For we are brought to this unhappy Dilemma, that we mu&s;t be either <HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory;</HI> and he that is either of the&s;e, if we con&s;ider the Natural Signification, or the com|mon Acceptation of the words, can neither be a Man of Loyalty to his Prince, nor Hone&s;ty to his Country. For the Words them&s;elves contain in them nothing but <HI>Villany</HI> and <HI>Di&s;|honesty,</HI> and the different Parties damn each other for <HI>Knaves</HI> and
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<HI>Ra&s;cals.</HI> Now if the&s;e things were true, we could not be far from a Ge|neral De&s;truction; and if our Unna|tural Divi&s;ions did not by their na|tural con&s;equences ruin us, yet we mu&s;t expect, that our <HI>Fatal End</HI> &s;hould very &s;oon come to pa&s;s by &s;ome Remarkable Judgment; For <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> were de&s;troyed for the want of ten Righteous Per|&s;ons, and if we mu&s;t be all <HI>Whigs</HI> or <HI>Tories,</HI> we mu&s;t then be con&s;um'd for want of one Hone&s;t Man; for according to the common cry, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to be Hone&s;t of any Party.</P>
<P>But thanks be to Providence we are at pre&s;ent in Being, and may be Safe and Happy under his Maje&s;ty's Government; for plain it is, that our di&s;tinction is only ill Names mi&s;ap|plied, and the be&s;t Men of the Na|tion are abus'd by fal&s;e Characters, that are fixt upon them under the colour of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory.</HI> I humbly conceive that there are both Knaves and Hone&s;t Men, Fools and Wi&s;e Men of both Parties; and therefore 'tis not the <HI>Name,</HI> but the <HI>Man</HI> that makes him to be what he is. 'Tis
<PB N="8" REF="9">
not being of this or that Party, but his Per&s;onal Merits or Faults, which render him Worthy or Unworthy; And if a Man, by being of any of the&s;e two Parties, can di&s;charge his Duty to his King, Church, and Country, as I &s;hall prove he may, He ju&s;tly de&s;erves our good E&s;teem and Commendation, let him be a <HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Tory.</HI> Such a one is a Loy|al Subject to his Sovereign, a Duti|ful Son of the Church, and a true Patriot of his Country. Such Loy|alty and Hone&s;ty will Shine thro' the thicke&s;t Cloud of Scandal and Malice, and the ba&s;e&s;t Artifices can|not hurt the Reputation of &s;o good a Man. <HI>His Hou&s;e &s;hall not fall, tho' the Winds blow, the Rain fall and the Floods come, for it is founded upon a Rock.</HI></P>
<P>And as this Di&s;tinction of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> will render Men &s;u&s;pected by their King and Country, &s;o it makes them Enemies to the E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Religion; for according to the receiv'd Maxims of Scandal a|mong&s;t us, He that is a <HI>Tory,</HI> is a <HI>Pa|pi&s;t,</HI> and He that is a <HI>Whig</HI> is a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter.</HI> Whereas there is no more
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Truth in any one of the&s;e A&s;&s;erti|ons, than if a Man was to &s;ay the Grand Seignior is a good Chri|&s;tian, or that the Moon is made of a Green Chee&s;e.</P>
<P>But the de&s;ign of Party-Men is not Truth, but to abu&s;e each other, and like <HI>Billinsgate</HI>-Orators, they that make the greate&s;t noi&s;e, and call the foule&s;t names, get the better of it, and come off with Flying Co|lours. 'Tis an excellent Remedy again&s;t the Spleen, to hear a <HI>Whig</HI> in the Coffee-Hou&s;e railing again&s;t a <HI>Tory,</HI> and damning him for all the <HI>Papi&s;t-Rogues,</HI> and <HI>Villains</HI> he can think off: and then have a Second Per&s;on commend him for his Railery, and &s;ay that this Man is a <HI>very. Hone&s;t worthy Gentleman, a good</HI> Prote&s;tant, <HI>a true Friend to the</HI> Ha|nover-<HI>Succe&s;&s;ion;</HI> ju&s;t as if a Man could give no better a Demon&s;trati|on of his Hone&s;ty, Religion and Loyalty to his Sovereign, than by abu&s;ing his Fellow Subject and ma|king him appear blacker than the Devil him&s;elf. So again the <HI>Tory</HI> damns the <HI>Whig</HI> for a <HI>Fanatical Dog,</HI> and a <HI>Presbyterian Ra&s;cal,</HI> and then
<PB N="10" REF="11">
his Brother-<HI>Tory</HI> applauds him for a True Church-Man. And notwith|&s;tanding the mighty Zeal of the&s;e two great oppo&s;ite Saints, you may &s;hake them both in a Bag, and he that comes out fir&s;t is the hone&s;te&s;t Man. For I have heard many a <HI>Tory-Rory-Boy</HI> drink a Health to the Church, Swear and Bully for the Church; nay one &s;aid, he laid with his Neighbours Wife, that he might get her to per&s;uade her Husband to vote for the Church; and yet none of the&s;e come to Church, ex|cept it be to &s;ee a Mi&s;tre&s;s, or meet a Friend to drink a bottle of Wine, after Evening Service. So again the <HI>Sly Whig,</HI> he returns God thanks for our late deliverance from Popery and Arbitrary Power; he Prays, and Cants; he never drinks a Di&s;h of Tea at the Coffee-Hou&s;e, but pulls of his Hat, lifts up his Eyes and Hands, and &s;ays a Formal Grace o|ver his Liquor. As &s;oon as it is dark, he &s;lips out into the &s;treet, picks up a Lady of the Town, goes to the Tavern, gets Drunk, and falls a &s;leep. Madam takes his Watch and
<PB N="11" REF="12">
his Rings, drinks his Health &s;ilently, withdraws and makes her Ha&s;ty <HI>Exit incognito.</HI></P>
<P>Now the&s;e are &s;ome of your great Party-Men, which are &s;tick|lers for the Church and Religion, <HI>In nomine Domini incipit omne malum,</HI> while others contend for Liberty and Property. The&s;e in &s;hort are tho&s;e, that are call'd by &s;ome of both Parties, the Patriots of their Country, whom I &s;hould &s;tyle, ac|cording to the be&s;t Skill that I have in Rhethorick, <HI>Mon&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Scan|dals</HI> of their Country. But not|with&s;tanding this &s;ort of <HI>Glorious</HI> Men, yet there are not wanting Per&s;ons of both Parties, who are neither <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> nor <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> Rakes nor Hypocrites; but are a credit to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion, Good Sub|jects to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and true Friends to their Country. What &s;hall we &s;ay of the&s;e <HI>Whigs,</HI> and <HI>Tories;</HI> and 'tis undeniably true, there are &s;uch of both Parties, who are Men of un&s;potted Reputation, with re&s;pect to their Morals; Men who never go to Meetings, but con|&s;tantly frequent the Church, and
<PB N="12" REF="13">
have the Common Prayer daily read in their Families; &s;hall we de|ny any of the&s;e to be <HI>Church-Men,</HI> notwith&s;tanding there be &s;ome of them <HI>Whigs.</HI> Give me leave to &s;ay, there <HI>are Church-Whigs,</HI> and <HI>Church-To|ries, Hone&s;t Whigs,</HI> and <HI>Honest Tories, Whigs Rogues,</HI> and <HI>Rogues Tories, Good</HI> and <HI>Bad of both Sorts.</HI> Let us then no longer abu&s;e any one for his name, but look upon the Man, ex|amine his Merits or Faults, and ac|cording to them pa&s;s our Judgment. If we find any one ju&s;t and hone&s;t, in his common dealings, living peace|ably and quietly under the Govern|ment, giving no di&s;turbance upon any account what&s;oever, but con|tributing his utmo&s;t Endeavours, either privately or publickly, to the Good of the King, Church and Country; He is a valuable Man, let him be a <HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Tory.</HI> Whereas &s;ome carry on their private Intere&s;t, and for this would Sacrifice the pub|lick Good, they would &s;ell the Na|tion for their own Advantage, and like a certain L&mdash;d run away with the Money, when they have done. When they Dance, they make o|thers
<PB N="13" REF="14">
pay the Fidler, and when they let us into the Secret, they leave us in the Lurch; they never call us till the Reckoning comes to be paid, and while we are for making every Man pay his Club, the&s;e Sharpers &s;lip off and give us the Go-by. Now &s;uch State-Juglers as the&s;e, let them be of what Party &s;oever, are Ene|mies to the Country, and ought not to be skreen'd by any &s;ort of People; they make Hone&s;t Men of their own Party &s;uffer in their Reputation, for we are apt to think, that one Scabby Sheep will infect the whole Flock; therefore both Parties &s;hould purge them&s;elves of &s;uch Knaves, and bring them to their Condign Puni&s;hment, and not &s;hew them a|ny Favour upon the Account of their pretended Principles; And this would be the way to do all hone&s;t Men Ju&s;tice of what Party &s;oever; and Demon&s;trate, that the name of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> is only an odious di|&s;tinction, to create Fears and Jea|lou&s;ies among&s;t People; and that on both Sides there are to be found Men of Worth and Probity, both with Re&s;pect to Church and State.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">
When therefore any Men are call'd to an Account, let us not be &s;uch Fools, as fir&s;t to run Mad our &s;elves, and then di&s;turb the whole Nation by Tumults and In&s;urrecti|ons; becau&s;e they who are Im|peach d and &s;hould come to a Legal Tryal, are of this or that Party. Con&s;ider not the Party, but the Per|&s;ons, not their Principles, with re|&s;pect to <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> but their A|ctions. And as they are good or bad, &s;o let them fall or &s;tand. We &s;hould think it very hard, that a Man &s;hould be hang'd upon the Ac|count of his Profe&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he was a Tinker, a Chimney-Sweeper or a Pedler: And we &s;hould e&s;teem it as unrea&s;onable for all the Bakers in <HI>London,</HI> to ri&s;e up in Arms, a|gain&s;t the Lord-Mayor, becau&s;e he order'd one of that Hone&s;t Fraterni|ty, who was &s;u&s;pected for a Cheat, to be tryed according to Law. We are got into the very &s;ame State, for Party-Men condemn the contra|ry Side, purely for oppo&s;ition-&s;ake; nor will they &s;uffer any of their own Political Per&s;wa&s;ion to be brought
<PB N="15" REF="16">
to Examination upon any Terms what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The Conduct of a great Man cannot be enquired into, but pre|&s;ently the Mob Ri&s;e, and they mu&s;t make them&s;elves Judges of the Ca&s;e; and what is &s;till wor&s;e, puni&s;h the Innocent for fear of Ju&s;tice or Inju|&s;tice done to the &s;u&s;pected Crimi|nals. What occa&s;ion could there be for any true <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> to make a di&s;turbance, becau&s;e of the late Im|peachments. If the Per&s;ons Im|peach'd were guilty of the crimes laid to their charge, then they de&s;erve Puni&s;hment; if Innocent, then they would be acquitted and come off with Honour. And why could we not without mole&s;ting the Govern|ment, let them come to a fair Try|al, and take their Fate, as we do by Men of le&s;s Note?</P>
<P>But then the cry of the&s;e Incen|diaries is, that right or wrong, tho&s;e Noble Peers were to lo&s;e their Heads to &s;atisfy the other Party.</P>
<P>This is a mo&s;t impudent arraing|ing the Highe&s;t Court of Judicature, and a malicious Su&s;picion of Inju|&s;tice, where the highe&s;t Ju&s;tice ought to be found. But admit
<PB N="16" REF="17">
for Argument-&s;ake, the Ca&s;e to be as bad, as malice can make it; And that the&s;e Lords would have &s;uffer'd unju&s;tly; would this ju&s;tify a Re|bellion, in which Ten Thou&s;and Lives, and many more might be lo&s;t, and an Ocean of Blood &s;plit? Are we to Sacrifice a Million for the Pre&s;ervation of two or three, and de&s;troy a whole Nation, to &s;ave &s;o &s;mall a number? Does the well be|ing of this Kingdom depend upon an <HI>Ox&mdash;d,</HI> or an <HI>Or&mdash;d,</HI> and are we then to venture our All, to &s;ecure them? we could have run no Danger in &s;uffering any one of the&s;e to come to their Trial, but we may ruine our &s;elves by endeavouring to hinder it? Far be it from every good Man's Heart, to wi&s;h harm to his Fellow Chri&s;tian and Subject, And Pity is it that a &s;ingle Hair of any one's Head &s;hould be hurt wrongfully; but &s;till we are not to make our &s;elves obnoxious to the Laws upon a bare Su&s;picion of o|thers &s;uffering unju&s;tly, and hinder the cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice for fear of In|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">
Should any one unde&s;ervedly lo&s;e his Life, let the Blood lie at their doors, who &s;hed it; but let not tho&s;e who are not Judges, a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves that Office, nor fly in the Face of Authority.</P>
<P>We &s;hall find it to be the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t Politicks, to live in Peace and Union, and Subjection to the Civil Power; and that it will not be worth our while to di&s;tract the Nation about this or that Per&s;on, one Party or the other.</P>
<P>We may &s;ee, by what has al|ready happen'd, the ill Con&s;equen|ces of our unhappy Divi&s;ions, Knock|ing one another on the Head, pul|ling down Hou&s;es, and rebelling a|gain&s;t their Lawful Soveraign. And now after all, what have they got by it? Why truly as they have been a Pack of A&s;&s;es, &s;o they are like to bear the Burden for their Pains. They have put the Government un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing new For|ces, and the Nation mu&s;t be at the Charges; they have made the Le|gi&s;lative Power, Publi&s;h &s;evere Laws again&s;t Riots, and thus they have made Rods for their own
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Backs: And now they complain of &s;everities and hard u&s;age; but who was the occa&s;ion of the&s;e things, if they be &s;o, but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A de&s;perate Di&s;temper mu&s;t have a de&s;perate cure, and mad Dogs mu&s;t have Medicines proper for their Madne&s;s. If People won't go to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> drink Water-Gruel, pick &s;traws, and live in a dark Room, let them walk &s;oberly and quietly about the Streets, and hurt no Body, and the Government will never meddle with them; but if they are &s;nappi&s;h and &s;narling, they mu&s;t be &s;napt up them&s;elves; if they grin and catch People by the Heels, they mu&s;t be kick't off. If they run raving and crying out in the &s;treet, the <HI>Pretender,</HI> they mu&s;t be &s;eized on, and be &s;ecur'd; as you would do a mad Man, who calls out <HI>Fire</HI> in the mid'&s;t of the Night, only to awake and di&s;turb the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>And therefore I wonder at tho&s;e, who exclaim again&s;t &s;u&s;pending the <HI>Habeas-Corpus</HI>-Act for a &s;mall Time. They are very much concern'd, and immoderately griev'd for the lo&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="20">
of <HI>Liberty;</HI> this they &s;ay was the Subject's Barrier, and ought to be kept Sacred and Inviolate. But if this be taking away the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Subject, 'twas not done, before the Subject de&s;troy'd the Peace of the Kingdom, which ought to be pre&s;erv'd as <HI>Sacred,</HI> as any of their <HI>Liberties;</HI> And therefore if they won't lo&s;e the one, let them not de&s;troy the other. When the whole Nation was in an uproar, 'twas Time to think of &s;ome Expedient to quell the In&s;urrection, and in Ex|tremity 'tis excu&s;able and lawful to do then, what would not be ju|&s;tifiable at another Time; when a Fire is in a Street, 'tis very common to blow up one Man's Hou&s;e, to &s;ave the re&s;t, and tho' that Man loo&s;es his Property, yet this is al|lowable, and is a common Practice without being condemn'd by any.</P>
<P>But dear Fellow-Subjects, let not your Blood boil too high, nor ca&s;t your &s;elves into &s;uch a violent Fever, but let this con&s;ideration moderate your Heat and allay your Pa&s;&s;ion. The Parliament who took off this
<PB N="20" REF="21">
Act, are as much concern'd in it as your &s;elves, by the way of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property;</HI> and 'tis humbly pre|&s;um'd, have as much to loo&s;e as any of tho&s;e, who condemn this Su&s;|pen&s;ion; &s;o that you may re&s;t &s;atis|fied, that they took care of them|&s;elves, and by con&s;equence of all o|ther Subjects. The Commons of <HI>England,</HI> don't pay &s;o great Com|pliment to the Prerogative, as to give up their Privileges by way of Civility.

This was only as I &s;aid before, an Expedient made u&s;e of, when in Extremity, and is only for a certain Time, and not a &s;tanding Act: For while the Nation is in &s;uch a Confu&s;ion, and there are &s;o many Enemies to the pre&s;ent Government, they mu&s;t make u&s;e of Extraordinary means to &s;ecure &s;uch from doing mi&s;|chief.

But as &s;oon as ever our Tumults are over, and the Na|tion is &s;ettled, never fear Old <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> but thou &s;halt have all thy <HI>Liberties</HI> re&s;tor'd, and enjoy more than your Soul can de&s;ire.</P>
<P>But now Gentlemen, con&s;ider what an Influence your di&s;turban|ces at Home, have had upon the People abroad, we have been threat|ned with an Inva&s;ion, and great Pre|parations were made for a De&s;cent.

The <HI>Pretender</HI> may give you a great many fine Flattering words; he may tell you, he won't break in upon the Con&s;titution of your Church and State; but you are madder than <HI>March-Hares,</HI> and more di&s;tracted than <HI>Bedlamites,</HI> if you believe him.

That unfortunate Prince was as well be|lov'd once, as ever any Monarch that &s;ate upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne; and had he kept his Coronation-Oath, he had made both him&s;elf and People Happy, and <HI>England</HI> a Glo|rious Nation. But how long did he keep it, ju&s;t as long as a Woman can keep a Secret, which is to divulge it to the next She meets? As &s;oon as ever he had an opportunity, he broke his Promi&s;e, and that made his Reign &s;o &s;hort and tran&s;itory. Poor unhappy and mi&s;guided Man, he &s;tuck at nothing, that promoted the Mother-Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was no more to him, than <HI>Magna Farta. Popi&s;h</HI> Chapels mu&s;t be built, and <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Bi&s;hops impri&s;on'd, and the Penal Laws and Te&s;t mu&s;t be taken off, and the whole Con&s;titution of Church and

State &s;ubverted: <HI>Jehu</HI> like he drove on as fa&s;t as he could, and when he found the Kingdom was too hot to hold him, he mounted his <HI>Pega&s;us,</HI> and rid Po&s;t away to <HI>France;</HI> when he came there, he told his Brother <HI>Lewis,</HI> that he had lo&s;t three King|doms upon the account of Religion. But his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, like a Pious good Prince, an&s;wer'd him, that before he would loo&s;e three Kingdoms for Religion, they &s;hould never know of what Religion he was. How far we may depend up|on the word of a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI>-Prince, I leave it to any one to &s;ay, who knows what was done here in <HI>En|gland</HI> between twenty eight, and one and thirty years ago.</P>
<P>Since then 'tis plain, that there is no dependance upon the word of a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI>-Prince, we are infatuated to the la&s;t degree, if ever we tru&s;t one again. The Fir&s;t Time we are cheated, 'tis the deceivers Fault, but the Second 'tis our own, therefore let us be &s;o wi&s;e, as not to be catch't twice in the &s;ame Snare.

He is as &s;lippery as an Eale; you can't tell where to take him to keep your hold; He has as many Eva&s;ions to fal&s;ify his Promi&s;e; as he has Promi&s;es to make: He'll break thro' an Oath, as fa&s;t as any Woman can break thro' her Matrimonal Vow. If he gives you Sweet Meat, you may be &s;ure to have Sower Sawce along with it, for many know, the Bondage and Slavery of a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Gov|ernment; you that have now the Bible to read, and can make as many different Religions out of it, as you will, mu&s;t then be contented with Oral Tradition and Implicit Faith.

<P>But to &s;peak more &s;eriou&s;ly to the Point, &s;hould the <HI>Pretender</HI> ever come to rule here, as God forbid, the Religion of the Church of <HI>En|gland,</HI> which is Pure, Primitive, and Apo&s;tolical, mu&s;t give way to ano|ther, who&s;e Principles are errone|ous, and will endanger our Salvati|on. We cannot live under him, without offering Violence to our Con&s;ciences, and contradicting our Rea&s;on; for in the Fir&s;t place we mu&s;t be Perjured, breaking thro' our Bapti&s;mal Vow, and Renounce our Holy Faith; we mu&s;t embrace

all the Ab&s;urdities, and Contradi|ctions that are contain'd in the <HI>Ro|mi&s;h</HI>-Creed. We mu&s;t believe Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, tho' it be a plain Impo&s;ition upon our Sen&s;es and contrary to the Laws of Na|ture. We mu&s;t turn Idolaters by Wor&s;hipping Idols, and praying to Saints, Martyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors, We mu&s;t have many Interce&s;&s;ors, which mu&s;t be multiplied to a very high degree; tho the Scriptures ad|mit but of one Mediator and Ad|vocate <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> In &s;hort we mu&s;t be Prie&s;t-rid even to Death.

But pray Gentlemen, what makes you unea&s;y under the pre&s;ent Gov|ernment; you have a King, who is a True Father of his Country, and treats his Subjects like Chil|dren. He grants you all the Indul|gences imaginable, you may be Safe under his Protection and Hap|py under his Government. And if we can but enjoy our Liberties, both Religious and Civil, what can we de&s;ire more. So long as we po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e, what need we trou|ble our Heads, what Mini&s;try his Maje&s;ty choo&s;es, or what Parlia|ment we have, let them be <HI>Whigs</HI> or <HI>Tories.</HI> Confound me Gen|tlemen, if I know what you mean by that di&s;tinction. I go to Church, and there I find Men, that are call'd <HI>Whigs,</HI> and tho&s;e that are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Name of <HI>To|ries;</HI> they all joyn in the &s;ame Wor|&s;hip, and make the &s;ame Re&s;pon&s;es; I look to &s;ee whether there is any difference in there Prayer-Books; I peep into a Whiggi&s;h Common-Prayer-Book, and after that I ca&s;t my Eye over a Tory-Common-Prayer-Book,
<PB N="29" REF="30">
and if you'll believe me, they are all the &s;ame, and all Publi&s;h'd by the Authority of the Government. Then again I hear &s;uch a Mini&s;ter is a <HI>Whig,</HI> and &s;uch a Clergy-Man is a <HI>Tory;</HI> then I ask, whether both the Whiggi&s;h and Tory-Clergy-Men be all ordain'd by <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Bi&s;hops; whether they Sub&s;cribe to the Nine and Thirty Articles, and the Canons of the Church; whether they all u&s;e the Common Prayer, and pray for King <HI>George,</HI> the Prince, the Prince&s;s and the Royal Family; upon Examination it appears they do conform to all the&s;e Particulars. This is enough to per&s;uade me, that <HI>Tories</HI> and <HI>Whigs</HI> in general are the &s;ame, and that both are Church of <HI>En|gland</HI>-Men; when therefore <HI>Tories</HI> are call'd <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Whigs Di&s;&s;en|ters,</HI> I am apt to think there is more Malice than Truth. When I &s;peak of <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories,</HI> I mean only &s;uch of both &s;orts, who publickly profe&s;s them&s;elves to be Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and con|form to her Doctrin and Wor&s;hip,

<P>If I would take to my &s;elf a|ny of the&s;e Names, <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> I would be both; the Rea|der will &s;ay, what do you mean by this, are you run mad too with your Incon&s;i&s;tencies and Con|tradiction? What has touch't your Noddle? A Man may think this to be very odd and &s;urprizing, that 'tis a Thing impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ee|ing that the&s;e two Parties agree like Fire and Water, Cats and Dogs, that are always &s;cratching and clawing, biting and tearing one Another; But for the &s;ame Man to be <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> is as common, as it is for a <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> to fall out and quarrel, and the wi&s;e&s;t of the Nation are &s;o, I que&s;tion not, but I have fill'd the Reader with Expectati|on, and that he wants this Rid|dle to be explain'd.

<PB N="31" REF="32">
your Nails, &s;cratch your Head, &s;tamp upon the Ground, and all this to know my meaning, I'll tell you in a few Words. For a Man to be both a <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> and be a good Man into the Bargain, is to be a <HI>Whig</HI> in State, and a <HI>Tory</HI> in Church; this is what your be&s;t States-men are, and what the wi&s;e&s;t and Hone&s;te&s;t part of the Nation have practic'd. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who are call'd <HI>To|ries,</HI> have come into the Revoluti|on, that was founded upon <HI>Whig|i&s;h</HI> Principles, and &s;o long as they have conform'd to the Governments of tho&s;e Crown'd Heads, that have reign'd &s;ince that happy Time, &s;o long they have in Fact been <HI>Whigs.</HI> So likewi&s;e the&s;e, as well as a great many profe&s;s'd <HI>Whigs,</HI> have been con&s;tant Communicants in the Church of <HI>England;</HI> have been Advocates for all its Rites an Ce|remonies, Doctrin and Wor&s;hip, and true Friends to Epi&s;copacy and Monarchy. In this they have been <HI>Tories.</HI> So that you &s;ee to be a <HI>Whig</HI> and a <HI>Tory,</HI> is neither a
<PB N="32" REF="33">
Contradiction nor a Di&s;commen|dable Practice; &s;o far from it that 'tis the Duty of every <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sub|ject, and 'tis the Con&s;titution of the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment. I mean no more by a <HI>Whig,</HI> than one that is for the Revolution, and admits King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne</HI> to have been our Lawful Soveraigns, and his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty now up|on the Throne, to be our rightful King. This is all that your <HI>Church Whigs</HI> contend for, and this is no le&s;s than what the <HI>Tories</HI> in Pra|ctice comply with, how much &s;o|ever their words may contradict their Actions. And therefore we &s;ee that <HI>Church-Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories</HI> are all the &s;ame, and we may u|nite and agree together, without the lea&s;t Scruple of Con&s;ci|ence.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> if it be a good one, will bind us to this U|nion; but I am afraid, where Par|ty-bu&s;ine&s;s is greate&s;t, there <HI>Con&s;ci|ence</HI> and <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> are kick't out of Doors, and have lea&s;t to do. This
<PB N="33" REF="34">
Word <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> puts me in mind of a Story concerning a Judge to an Evidence, the latter had a ve|ry large Beard, which the former reflected upon; &s;ays the Judge who had a &s;mooth Face, and little or no Beard, <HI>if your Con&s;cience be like your Beard, 'tis a very large one,</HI> and replied the Witne&s;s, <HI>if your Lord&s;hips Con&s;cience be like your Beard, you have none at all.</HI> I am afraid the ca&s;e is much the &s;ame betwixt <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> when they grow Noi&s;y and Mutinous. The <HI>Whig,</HI> while he is &s;hewing his Zeal for the cau&s;e, he forgets common Cha|rity and Chri&s;tianity, and lays on upon the <HI>Tory</HI> mo&s;t unmercifully. The <HI>Tory</HI> on the other Hand is &s;o much enrag'd with the Zeal of Pa&s;|&s;ive-Obedience, that he makes In|&s;urrections, and Flies into open Re|bellion again&s;t the King and Go|vernment; &s;o that in &s;hort the vio|lent Men of both Parties are Mad.
