<P>THOSE who are acquainted with Italian mu&s;ical compo&s;itions, mu&s;t know that there are among them many &s;hort comic dramas, (a longer &s;ort of cantatas) where little fables are pur&s;ued; &s;uch as La Serva Padrona, Baioco e Serpilla, Lo Mae&s;tro di Cappella, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It has been &s;ugge&s;ted to the managers of RANELAGH, by a gentleman long pre&s;iding with unrival'd talents, over the mo&s;t ca|pital of our public entertainments; that &s;omething in the &s;ame way wou'd be an improvement upon the detached &s;ongs and ballads, u&s;ually &s;ung in their orche&s;tra. In deference to his judgment, this is an E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">
It would be needle&s;s to ob&s;erve that the words are to be no farther con&s;ider'd than as they are adapted, and &s;erve to give &s;tile and character to the mu&s;ic. But &s;hould&punc; the mu&s;ic, when it has been &s;uffi|ciently heard to render it &s;ome what fa|miliar, be found plea&s;ing enough to make the entertainment, on the whole, agreeable to the public, other pieces may be written much more pardonable, than what has here, at a &s;hort warning, been in great ha&s;te put together.</P>
