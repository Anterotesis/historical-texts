<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the
Reader, that this Play is printed ex|actly
as it is acted; for, tho' the Players
in Compliance with the Ta&s;te of the
Town, broke it into five Parts in the Re|pre&s;entation;
yet, as the Action pau&s;es,
and the Stage is left vacant but three
times, &s;o it properly con&s;i&s;ts but of three
Acts, like the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Comedies.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t farther own the A&s;&s;i&s;tance I have
receiv'd in this Piece from two of my
Friends; who, tho' they will not allow
me the Honour of having their Names
join'd with mine, cannot deprive me of
the Plea&s;ure of making this Acknow|ledgment.</P>
