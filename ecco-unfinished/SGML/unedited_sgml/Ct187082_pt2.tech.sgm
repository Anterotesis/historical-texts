<P>WITH deep concern Edgar revolved in his mind
the &s;ugge&s;tions of Dr. Marchmont; and meditation,
far from dimini&s;hing, added importance to the
arguments of his friend. To obtain the hand of an
object he &s;o highly admired, though but lately his
&s;ole wi&s;h, appeared now an uncertain ble&s;&s;ing, a &s;u&s;|picious
good, &s;ince the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart was no
longer to be con&s;idered as its in&s;eparable appendage.
His very &s;ecurity of the approbation of Mr. and
Mrs. Tyrold became a &s;ource of &s;olicitude; and,
&s;ecret from them, from her, and from all, he deter|mined
to guard his views&punc; till he could find &s;ome op|portunity
of inve&s;tigating her own unbia&s;&s;ed &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>Such were his ruminations, when, on re-entering
the Park, he perceived her wandering alone amid&s;t
the trees. Her figure looked &s;o intere&s;ting, her air
&s;o &s;erious, her &s;olitude &s;o attractive, that every
maxim of tardy prudence, every caution of timid
fore&s;ight, would in&s;tantly have given way to the
quick feelings of generous impul&s;e, had he not been
re&s;trained by his promi&s;e to Dr. Marchmont. He
di&s;mounted, and giving his hor&s;e to his groom, re|traced
her foot&s;teps.</P>
<P>Camilla, almo&s;t without her own knowledge, had
&s;trolled towards the gate, whence &s;he concluded Ed|gar
to have ridden from the Park, and, almo&s;t with|out
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, had continued &s;auntering in its
vicinity; yet &s;he no &s;ooner de&s;cried him, than,
&s;truck with a &s;pecies of &s;elf-accu&s;ation for this ap|pearance
of awaiting him, &s;he cro&s;&s;ed over to the
<PB N="194" REF="3">
neare&s;t path towards the hou&s;e, and, for the fir&s;t
time, was aware of the approach of Edgar without
ha&s;tening to meet him.</P>
<P>He &s;lackened his pace, to quiet his &s;pirits, and
re&s;tore his manner to its cu&s;tomary &s;erenity, before
he permitted him&s;elf to overtake her. &startq;Can you,&endq;
he then cried, &startq;forgive me, when you hear I have
been fulfilling my own appointment, and have po&s;t|poned
my promi&s;ed inve&s;tigation?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Rather &s;ay,&endq; &s;he gently an&s;wered, &startq;could I
have forgiven you, if you had &s;hewn me you thought
my impatience too ungovernable for any delay?&endq;</P>
<P>To find her thus willing to oblige him, was a new
delight, and he expre&s;&s;ed his acknowledgments in
terms the mo&s;t flattering.</P>
<P>An unu&s;ual &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s made her hear him almo&s;t
without reply; yet peace and harmony revi&s;ited her
mind, and, in li&s;tening to his valued prai&s;e, &s;he for|got
her late alarm at her own &s;en&s;ations, and without
extending a thought beyond the pre&s;ent in&s;tant, again
felt tranquil and happy: while to Edgar &s;he ap|peared
&s;o completely all that was adorable, that he
could only remember to repent his engagement with
Dr. Marchmont.</P>
<P>Her &s;ecret opinion that he was di&s;&s;atisfied with
his lot, gave a &s;oftne&s;s to her accents that enchanted
him; while the high e&s;teem for his character, which
mingled with her pity, joined to a lowered &s;en&s;e of
her own, from a new-born terror le&s;t that pity were
too tender, &s;pread a charm wholly new over her na|tive
fire and vivacity.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, they were overtaken by Man|dlebert's
gardener, who was bringing from Beech
Park a ba&s;ket of flowers for his ma&s;ter. They were
&s;elected from curious hot-hou&s;e plants, and Camilla
&s;topt to admire their beauty and fragrance.</P>
<P>Edgar pre&s;ented her the ba&s;ket; whence &s;he &s;im|ply
took a &s;prig of myrtle and geranium, conceiving
the pre&s;ent to be de&s;igned for Indiana. &startq;If you
are fond of geraniums,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;there is an almo&s;t
<PB N="195" REF="4">
endle&s;s variety in my green-hou&s;e, and I will bring
you to-morrow &s;ome &s;pecimens.&endq;</P>
<P>She thanked him, and while he gave orders to the
gardener, Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana advanced from
the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland had &s;een them from her window,
where, in vain deliberation, &s;he had been con&s;idering
what &s;tep to take. But, upon beholding them to|gether,
&s;he thought deliberation and patience were
hopele&s;s, and determined, by a deci&s;ive &s;troke, to
break in its bud the connection &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed forming,
or throw upon Camilla all cen&s;ure, if &s;he failed, as
the &s;ole means &s;he could devi&s;e to exculpate her own
fagacity from impeachment. She called upon In|diana,
therefore, to accompany her into the Park,
exclaiming, in an angry tone, &startq;Mi&s;s Lynmere, I
will &s;hew you the true cau&s;e why Mr. Mandlebert
does not declare him&s;elf&mdash;your cou&s;in, Mi&s;s Camilla,
is wheedling him away from you.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana, who&s;e belief in almo&s;t whatever was &s;aid,
was undi&s;turbed by any &s;pecies of reflection, felt
filled with re&s;entment, and a &s;en&s;e of injury, and
readily following, &s;aid&mdash;&startq;I was &s;ure there was &s;ome|thing
more in it than I &s;aw, becau&s;e Mr. Melmond
behaved &s;o differently. But I don't take it very kind
of my cou&s;in, I can tell her!&endq;</P>
<P>They then hurried into the Park; but, as they
came without any plan, they were no &s;ooner within
a few yards of the meeting, than they &s;topt &s;hort, at
a lo&s;s what to &s;ay or do.</P>
<P>Edgar, vexed at their interruption, continued
talking to the gardener, to avoid joining them; but
&s;eeing Camilla, who le&s;s than ever wi&s;hed for their
communications, walk in&s;tantly another way, he
thought it would be improper to pur&s;ue her, and
only bowing to Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana, went
into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;This is wor&s;e than ever,&endq; cried Mi&s;s Margland,
&startq;to &s;talk off without &s;peaking, or even offering you
any of his flowers, which, I dare &s;ay, are only to be
put into the parlour flower-pots, for the whole hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="5">
&startq;I'm &s;ure I'm very glad of it,&endq; &s;aid Indiana, &startq;for
I hate flowers; but I'm &s;ure Mr. Melmond would
not have done &s;o; nor Colonel Andover; nor Mr.
Macder&s;ey more than all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, nor any body el&s;e, my dear, that had com|mon
&s;en&s;e, and their eyes open; nor Mr. Mandlebert
neither, if it were not for Mi&s;s Camilla. However,
we'll let her know we &s;ee what &s;he is about; and let
Sir Hugh know too: for as to the colonels, and the
en&s;igns, and that young Oxford &s;tudent, they won't
at all do; officers are commonly worth nothing; and
&s;cholars, you may take my word for it, my dear,
are the dulle&s;t men in the world. Be&s;ides, one would
not give up &s;uch a fine fortune as Mr. Mandlebert's
without making a little &s;truggle for it. You don't
know how many pretty things you may do with it.
So let us &s;hew her we don't want for &s;pirit, and
&s;peak to her at once.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e words, reviving in the mind of Indiana
her wedding clothes, the train of &s;ervants, and the
new equipage, gave fre&s;h pique to her provocation:
but finding &s;ome difficulty to overtake the fleet Ca|milla,
who&s;e pace kept mea&s;ure with her wi&s;h to
avoid them, &s;he called after her, to de&s;ire &s;he would
not walk &s;o fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Camilla reluctantly loitered, but without &s;topping
or turning to meet them, that &s;he might &s;till regale
her&s;elf with the perfume of the geranium pre&s;ented
her by Edgar.</P>
<P>&startq;You're in great ha&s;te, ma'am,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Mar|gland,
&startq;which I own I did not ob&s;erve to be the
ca&s;e ju&s;t now!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, in much &s;urpri&s;e, a&s;ked, what &s;he meant.</P>
<P>&startq;My meaning is pretty plain, I believe, to any
body that cho&s;e to under&s;tand it. However, though
Mi&s;s Lynmere &s;corns to be her own champion, I can|not,
as a friend, be quite &s;o pa&s;&s;ive, nor help hinting
to you, how little you would like &s;uch a proceeding
to your&s;elf, from any other per&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What proceeding?&endq; cried Camilla, blu&s;hing,
from a dawning comprehen&s;ion of the &s;ubject, though
re&s;enting the manner of the complaint.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="6">
&startq;Nay, only a&s;k your&s;elf, ma'am, only a&s;k your|&s;elf,
Mi&s;s Camilla, how you &s;hould like to be &s;o &s;up|planted,
if &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment were forming for
your&s;elf, and every thing were fixt, and every body
el&s;e refu&s;ed, and nobody to hinder its all taking place,
but a near relation of your own, who ought to be
the fir&s;t to help it forward. I &s;hould like to know,
I &s;ay, Mi&s;s Camilla, how you would feel, if it were
your own ca&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed and indignant at &s;o &s;udden and violent
an a&s;&s;ault, Camilla &s;tood &s;u&s;pended, whether to deign
any vindication, or to walk &s;ilently away: yet its
implications involuntarily filled with a thou&s;and other,
and le&s;s offending emotions than tho&s;e of anger, and
a general confu&s;ion crim&s;oned her cheeks.</P>
<P>&startq;You cannot but be &s;en&s;ible, ma'am,&endq; re&s;umed
Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;for &s;en&s;e is not what you want,
that you have &s;educed Mr. Mandlebert from your
cou&s;in; you cannot but &s;ee he takes hardly the
&s;malle&s;t notice of her, from the pains you are at to
make him admire nobody but your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of Camilla now ro&s;e high to her aid, at
a charge thus impertinent and unju&s;t. &startq;Mi&s;s Mar|gland,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;you &s;hock and amaze me! I am
at a lo&s;s for any motive to &s;o cruel an accu&s;ation:
but you, I hope at lea&s;t, my dear Indiana, are con|vinced
how much it injures me.&endq; She would then
have taken the hand of Indiana, but di&s;dainfully
drawing it back, &startq;I &s;han't break my heart about it,
I a&s;&s;ure you,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;you are va&s;tly welcome to
him for me; I hope I am not quite &s;o odious, but I
may find other people in the world be&s;ides Mr. Man|dlebert!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, as to that,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;I am
&s;ure you have only to look in order to chu&s;e; but
&s;ince this affair has been &s;ettled by your uncle, I can't
&s;ay I think it very grateful in any per&s;on to try to
over&s;et his particular wi&s;hes. Poor old gentleman!
I'm &s;ure I pity him! It will go hard enough with
him, when he comes to hear it! Such a requital!&mdash;
and from his own niece!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="7">
This was an attack the mo&s;t offen&s;ive that Camilla
could receive; nothing could &s;o nearly touch her as
an idea of ingratitude to her uncle, and re&s;ting upon
that, the whole tide of tho&s;e feelings which were, in
fact, divided and &s;ubdivided into many cro&s;&s;ing chan|nels,
&s;he broke forth, with great eagerne&s;s, into ex|claiming,
Mi&s;s Margland, this is quite barbarous!
You know, and you, Indiana, cannot but know, I
would not give my uncle the &s;malle&s;t pain, to be
mi&s;tre&s;s of a thou&s;and univer&s;es!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;&s;hould you
break up a &s;cheme which he has &s;o much &s;et his heart
upon? Why are you always winning over Mr. Man|dlebert
to your&s;elf, by all that flattery? Why are
you always con&s;ulting him? always obliging him?
always of his opinion? always ready to take his ad|vice?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;s Margland,&endq; replied Camilla, with the ex|treme&s;t
agitation, &startq;this is &s;o unexpected&mdash;&s;o unde|&s;erved
an interpretation&mdash;my con&s;ultation, or my ac|quie&s;cence,
have been merely from re&s;pect; no other
thought, no other motive&mdash;Good God! what is it you
imagine?&mdash;what guilt would you impute to me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O dear,&endq; cried Indiana, &startq;pray don't &s;uppo&s;e
it &s;ignifies. If you like to make compliments in
that manner to gentlemen, pray do it. I hope I
&s;hall always hold my&s;elf above it. I think it's their
place to make compliments to me.&endq;</P>
<P>A re&s;entful an&s;wer was ri&s;ing to the tongue of
Camilla, when &s;he perceived her two little &s;prigs,
which in her recent di&s;order &s;he had dropt, were de|moli&s;hing
under the feet of Indiana, who, with ap|parent
unmeaningne&s;s, but internal &s;u&s;picion of their
giver, had trampled upon them both. Ha&s;tily &s;toop|ing
&s;he picked them up, and, with evident vexation,
was blowing from them the du&s;t and dirt, when In|diana
&s;coffingly &s;aid, &startq;I wonder where you got
that geranium?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I don't wonder at all,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland,
&startq;for Sir Hugh has none of that &s;pecies; &s;o one
may ea&s;ily gue&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="8">
Camilla felt her&s;elf blu&s;h, and letting the flowers
fall, turned to Indiana, and &s;aid, &startq;Cou&s;in, if on
my account, it is po&s;&s;ible you can &s;uffer the &s;malle&s;t
unea&s;ine&s;s, tell me but what I &s;hall do&mdash;you &s;hall
dictate to me&mdash;you &s;hall command me.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana di&s;claimed all intere&s;t in her behaviour;
but Mi&s;s Margland cried, &startq;What you can do,
ma'am, is this, and nothing can be ea&s;ier, nor fairer:
leave off paying all that court to Mr Mandlebert, of
a&s;king his advice, and follow your own way, whether
he likes it or not, and go to &s;ee Mrs. Arlbery, and
Mrs. every body el&s;e, when you have a mind, without
waiting for his permi&s;&s;ion, or troubling your&s;elf about
what he thinks of it.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now trembled in every joint, and with
difficulty re&s;trained from tears, while, timidly, &s;he
&s;aid&mdash;&startq;And do you, my dear Indiana, demand of
me this conduct? and will it, at lea&s;t, &s;atisfy you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me? O dear no! I demand nothing, I a&s;&s;ure
you. The whole matter is quite indifferent to me,
and you may a&s;k his leave for every thing in the
world, if you chu&s;e it. There are people enough
ready to take my part, I hope, if you &s;et him again&s;t
me ever &s;o much.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, indeed, Indiana,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, over|powered
with conflicting &s;en&s;ations, &startq;this is u&s;ing
me very unkindly!&endq; And, without waiting to hear
another word, &s;he hurried into the hou&s;e, and flew
to hide her&s;elf in her own room.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t bitter moment &s;he had ever
known. Peace, gay though uniform, had been the
con&s;tant inmate of her brea&s;t, enjoyed without
thought, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without &s;truggle; not the &s;ub|dued
gift of accommodating philo&s;ophy, but the in|born
and genial produce of youthful felicity's be&s;t
aliment, the energy of its own animal &s;pirits.</P>
<P>She had, indeed, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, thought
Edgar of too refined and too &s;u&s;ceptible a character
for the unthinking and undi&s;tingui&s;hing Indiana;
and for the la&s;t day or two, her regret at his fate had
&s;trengthened it&s;elf into an aver&s;ene&s;s of his &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="200" REF="9">
de&s;tination, that made the idea of it painful, and the
&s;ubject repugnant to her; but &s;he had never, till this
very morning, di&s;tru&s;ted the innoxiou&s;ne&s;s either of
her pity or her regard; and, &s;tartled at the fir&s;t &s;ur|mi&s;e
of danger, &s;he had wi&s;hed to fly even from her|&s;elf,
rather than venture to inve&s;tigate feelings &s;o un|welcome;
yet &s;till and invariably, &s;he had concluded
Edgar the future hu&s;band of Indiana.</P>
<P>To hear there were any doubts of the intended
marriage, filled her with emotions indefinable; to
hear her&s;elf named as the cau&s;e of tho&s;e doubts, was
alarming both to her integrity and her delicacy. She
felt the extreme&s;t anger at the unprovoked and un|warrantable
har&s;hne&s;s of Mi&s;s Margland, and a re|&s;entment
nearly equal at the determined petulance,
and unju&s;tifiable a&s;per&s;ions of Indiana.</P>
<P>Satisfied of the innocence of her intentions, &s;he
knew not what alteration &s;he could make in her be|haviour;
and, after various plans, concluded, that to
make none would be&s;t manife&s;t her freedom from &s;elf|reproach.
At the &s;ummons therefore to dinner, &s;he
was the fir&s;t to appear, eager to &s;how her&s;elf un|moved
by the inju&s;tice of her accu&s;ers, and de&s;irous
to convince them &s;he was fearle&s;s of examination.</P>
<P>Yet, too much di&s;compo&s;ed to talk in her u&s;ual
manner, &s;he &s;eized upon a book till the party was
&s;eated. An&s;wering then to the call of her uncle,
with as ea&s;y an air as &s;he could a&s;&s;ume, &s;he took her
accu&s;tomed place by his &s;ide, and began, for mere
employment, filling a plate from the di&s;h that was
neare&s;t to her; which &s;he gave to the footman, with|out
any direction whither to carry, or enquiry if any
body cho&s;e to eat of it.</P>
<P>It was taken round the table, and, though refu&s;ed
by all, &s;he heaped up another plate, with the &s;ame
diligence and &s;peed as if it had been accepted.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had been accidentally detained, only
now entered, apologizing for being &s;o late.</P>
<P>Engro&s;&s;ed by the pride of &s;elf-defence, and the
indignancy of unmerited unkindne&s;s, the di&s;turbed
<PB N="201" REF="10">
mind of Camilla had not yet formed one &s;eparate
reflection, nor even admitted a di&s;tinct idea of Ed|gar
him&s;elf, di&s;engaged from the accu&s;ation in which
he &s;tood involved. But he had now amply his turn.
The moment he appeared, the deepe&s;t blu&s;hes co|vered
her face; and an emotion &s;o powerful beat in
her brea&s;t, that the immediate impul&s;e of her im|petuous
feelings, was to declare her&s;elf ill, and run
out of the room.</P>
<P>With this view &s;he ro&s;e; but a&s;hamed of her plan,
&s;eated her&s;elf the next moment, though &s;he had fir&s;t
overturned her plate and a &s;auce-boat in the vehe|mence
of her ha&s;te.</P>
<P>This accident rather recovered than di&s;concerted
her, by affording an unaffected occupation, in beg|ging
pardon of Sir Hugh, who was the chief &s;ufferer,
changing the napkins, and re&s;toring the table to
order.</P>
<P>&startq;What upon earth can be the matter with Mi&s;s
Camilla, I can't gue&s;s!&endq; exclaimed Mi&s;s Margland,
though with an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;pite that fully contra|dicted
her difficulty of conjecture.</P>
<P>&startq;I hope,&endq; &s;aid Edgar &s;urprized, &startq;Mi&s;s Camilla
is not ill?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I can't &s;ay I think my cou&s;in looks very bad!&endq;
&s;aid Indiana.</P>
<P>Camilla, who was rubbing a part of her gown
upon which nothing had fallen, affected to be too
bu&s;y to hear them: While Sir Hugh, concluding her
&s;ilent from &s;hame, entreated her not to think of his
cloaths, which were worth no great matter, not
being his be&s;t by two or three &s;uits. Her thoughts
had not waited this injunction; yet it was in vain &s;he
&s;trove to behave as if nothing had happened. Her
&s;pirit in&s;tigated, but it would not &s;upport her; her
voice grew hu&s;ky, &s;he &s;tammered, forgot, as &s;he
went on, what &s;he de&s;igned to &s;ay when &s;he began
&s;peaking, and frequently was forced to &s;top &s;hort,
with a faint laugh at her&s;elf, and with a colour every
moment encrea&s;ing. And the very in&s;tant the cloth
<PB N="202" REF="11">
was removed, &s;he ro&s;e, unable to con&s;train her&s;elf
any longer, and ran up &s;tairs to her own room.</P>
<P>There all her efforts evaporated in tears. &startq;Cruel,
cruel, Mi&s;s Margland,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;unju&s;t, unkind
Indiana! how have I merited this treatment! What
can Edgar think of my di&s;turbance? What can I
devi&s;e to keep from his knowledge the barbarous ac|cu&s;ation
which has cau&s;ed it?&endq;</P>
<P>In a few minutes &s;he heard the &s;tep of Eugenia.</P>
<P>A&s;hamed, &s;he ha&s;tily wiped her eyes; and before
the door could be opened, was at the further end of
the room, looking into one of her drawers.</P>
<P>&startq;What is it that has vexed my deare&s;t Camilla?&endq;
cried her kind &s;i&s;ter, &startq;&s;omething I am &s;ure has
grieved her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot gue&s;s what I have done with&mdash;I can
no where find&mdash;&endq; &s;tammered Camilla, engaged in
&s;ome apparent &s;earch, but too much confu&s;ed to name
any thing of which &s;he might probably be in want.</P>
<P>Eugenia de&s;ired to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, but a &s;ervant came to
the door, to tell them that the company was going
to the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, whither Sir Hugh begged they
would follow.</P>
<P>Camilla be&s;ought Eugenia to join them, and make
her excu$es: but, fearing Mi&s;s Margland would at|tribute
her ab&s;conding to guilt, or cowardice, &s;he
bathed her eyes in cold water, and overtook her &s;i&s;ter
at the &s;tairs of the little building.</P>
<P>In a&s;cending them, &s;he heard Mi&s;s Margland &s;ay,
&startq;I dare believe nothing's the matter but &s;ome
whim; for to be &s;ure as to whims, Mi&s;s Camilla has
the mo&s;t of any creature I ever &s;aw, and Mi&s;s Lyn|mere
the lea&s;t; for you may imagine, Mr. Mandle|bert,
I have pretty good opportunity to &s;ee all the&s;e
young people in their real colours.&endq;</P>
<P>Over&s;et by this malignancy, &s;he was again flying
to the refuge of her own room, and the relief of
tears, when the conviction of &s;uch po&s;itive ill-will in
Mi&s;s Margland, for which &s;he could a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on,
but her unju&s;t and exclu&s;ive partiality to Indiana,
checked her precipitancy. She feared &s;he would
<PB N="203" REF="12">
con&s;true to &s;till another whim her non-appearance, and
re&s;uming a little fre&s;h &s;trength from fre&s;h re&s;entment,
turned back; but the various keen &s;en&s;ations &s;he ex|perienced
as &s;he entered the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, rendered
this little action the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;tretch of fortitude,
her &s;hort and happy life had yet called upon her to
make.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh addre&s;&s;ed her with &s;ome kind enquiries,
which &s;he ha&s;tily an&s;wered, while &s;he pretended to
be bu&s;y in preparing to wind &s;ome &s;ewing &s;ilk upon
cards.</P>
<P>She could have cho&s;en no employment le&s;s adapted
to di&s;play the cool indifference &s;he wi&s;hed to manife&s;t
to Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana. She pulled the &s;ilk
the wrong way, twi&s;ted, twirled, and entangled it
continually; and while &s;he talked volubly of what
&s;he was about, as if it were the &s;ole &s;ubject of her
thoughts, her &s;haking hands &s;hewed her whole frame
di&s;ordered, and her high colour betrayed her &s;trong
internal emotion.</P>
<P>Edgar looked at her with &s;urprize and concern.
What had dropt from Mi&s;s Margland of her whims,
he had heard with di&s;dain; for, without &s;u&s;pecting
her of malice to Camilla, he concluded her warped
by her prejudice in favour of Indiana. Dr. March|mont,
however, had bid him judge by proof, not
appearance; and he re&s;olved therefore to inve&s;tigate
the cau&s;e of this di&s;quiet; before he acted upon his
belief in its blamele&s;&s;ne$$.</P>
<P>Having completely &s;poilt one &s;kein, &s;he threw it
a&s;ide, and &s;aying &startq;the weather's &s;o &s;ine, I cannot
bear to &s;tay within,&endq;&mdash;left her &s;ilk, her winders, and
her work-bag, on the fir&s;t chair, and &s;kipt down the
&s;tairs.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh declined walking, but would let nobody
remain with him. Edgar, as if &s;tudying the clouds,
glided down fir&s;t. Camilla, perceiving him, bent
her head, and began gathering &s;ome flowers. He
&s;tood by her a moment in &s;ilence, and then &s;aid:
&startq;To-morrow morning without fail, I will wait upon
Mrs. Needham.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="13">
&startq;Pray take your own time. I am not in any
ha&s;te.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are very good, and I am more obliged to
you than I can expre&s;s, for &s;uffering my officious
interference with &s;uch patience.&endq;</P>
<P>A ru&s;tling of &s;ilk made Camilla now look up, and
&s;he perceived Mi&s;s Margland leaning half out of the
window of the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, from earne&s;tne&s;s to
catch what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Angry thus to be watched, and per&s;uaded that
both innocence and dignity called upon her to make
no change in her open con&s;ideration for Edgar, &s;he
an&s;wered, in a voice that &s;trove to be more audible,
but that irre&s;i&s;tibly trembled, &startq;I beg you will im|partially
con&s;ult your own judgment, and decide as
you think right.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, now, became as little compo&s;ed as her|&s;elf:
the power with which &s;he inve&s;ted him, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
a charm to di&s;&s;olve every he&s;itating doubt;
and when, upon her rai&s;ing her head, he perceived
the redne&s;s of her eyes, and found that the pertur|bation
which had perplexed him was mingled with
&s;ome affliction, the mo&s;t tender anxiety filled his
mind, and though &s;omewhat checked by the vicinity
of Mi&s;s Margland, his voice expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t
&s;olicitude, as he &s;aid, &startq;I know not how to thank
you for this &s;weetne&s;s; but I fear &s;omething di&s;turbs
you? I fear you are not well, or are not happy?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla again bent over the flowers; but it was
not to &s;cent their fragrance; &s;he &s;ought only a hid|ing
place for her eyes, which were gu&s;hing with tears;
and though &s;he wi&s;hed to fly a thou&s;and miles off,
&s;he had not courage to take a &s;ingle &s;tep, nor force
to tru&s;t her voice with the &s;horte&s;t reply.</P>
<P>&startq;You will not &s;peak? yet you do not deny that
you have &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s?&mdash;Could I give it but the
&s;malle&s;t relief, how fortunate I &s;hould think my&s;elf!
And is it quite impo&s;&s;ible?&mdash;Do you forbid me to
a&s;k what it is?&mdash;forbid me the indulgence even to
&s;ugge&s;t&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="14">
&startq;A&s;k nothing! &s;ugge&s;t nothing! and think of
it no more!&endq; interrupted Camilla, &startq;if you would
not make me quite&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;topt &s;uddenly, not to utter the word unhappy,
of which &s;he felt the improper &s;trength at the mo|ment
it was quivering on her lips, and leaving her
&s;entence unfini&s;hed, abruptly walked away.</P>
<P>Edgar could not pre&s;ume to follow, yet felt her
conque&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible. Her &s;elf-denial with regard to
Mrs. Arlbery won his highe&s;t approbation; her com|pliance
with his wi&s;hes convinced him of her e&s;teem;
and her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o new and &s;o unaccountable, cen|tered
every wi&s;h of his heart in a de&s;ire to &s;olace, and
to revive her.</P>
<P>To obtain this privilege ha&s;tened at once and de|termined
his mea&s;ures; he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, there|fore,
from walking, and went in&s;tantly to his cham|ber,
to reclaim, by a ha&s;ty letter to Dr. Marchmont,
his procra&s;tinating promi&s;e.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER>To Dr. Marchmont.</OPENER>
<P>ACCUSE me not of precipitance, my dear Doctor,
nor believe me capable of forgetting the wi&s;dom of
your &s;ugge&s;tions, nor of lightly weighing tho&s;e evils
with which your zeal has encompa&s;&s;ed me, though I
write at this in&s;tant to confe&s;s a total contrariety of
&s;entiment, to call back every promi&s;e of delay, and
to make an unqualified avowal, that the period of
caution is pa&s;t! Camilla is not happy&mdash;&s;omething,
<PB N="206" REF="15">
I know not what, has di&s;turbed the gay ferenity of
her bo&s;om: &s;he has forbid me to enquire the cau&s;e;
&mdash;one way only remains to give me a claim to her
confidence.&mdash;O doctor! wonder not if cold, tardy,
&s;u&s;picious&mdash;I had nearly &s;aid unfeeling, caution,
&s;hrinks at &s;uch a moment, from the ri&s;ing influence
of warmer &s;ympathy, which bids me &s;ooth her in
di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hield her from danger, &s;trengthen all her
virtues, and participate in their emanations!</P>
<P>You will not do me the inju&s;tice to think me ei|ther
impelled or blinded by external enchantments;
you know me to have with&s;tood their yet fuller blaze
in her cou&s;in: O no! were &s;he de&s;poiled of all per|&s;onal
attraction by the &s;ame ravaging di&s;temper that
has been &s;o fierce with her poor &s;i&s;ter; were a &s;imilar

beauty, all of elegance, all of rank, all of wealth,
the whole kingdom, in &s;ome wonderful aggregate,

<P>Her face, her form, however penetrating in love|line&s;s,
aid, but do not con&s;titute, her charms; no,
'tis the quick intelligence of &s;oul that mounts to her
eyes, 'tis the &s;pirit checked by &s;weetne&s;s, the &s;weet|ne&s;s

</LETTER>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, &s;hut up in her room, wept
almo&s;t without ce&s;&s;ation, from a &s;en&s;e of general un|happine&s;s,
though fixed to no point, and from a di&s;|turbance
<PB N="207" REF="16">
of mind, a confu&s;ion of ideas and of feelings,
that rendered her incapable of reflection. She was
again followed by Eugenia, and could no longer re|fu&s;e,
to her tender anxiety, a &s;hort detail of the at|tack
which occa&s;ioned her di&s;order; happy, at lea&s;t,
in reciting it, that by unfolding the cau&s;e, there no
longer remained any nece&s;&s;ity to repre&s;s the effects
of her affliction.</P>
<P>To her great &s;urpri&s;e, however, Eugenia only
&s;aid: &startq;And is this all, my dear Camilla?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All!&endq; exclaimed Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, is it all?&mdash;I was afraid &s;ome great mi&s;|fortune
had happened.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what could happen more painful, more
&s;hocking, more cruel?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A thou&s;and things! for this is nothing but a
m$re mi&s;take; and you &s;hould not make your&s;elf un|happy
about it, becau&s;e you are not to blame.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is it then nothing to be accu&s;ed of de&s;igns and
intentions &s;o criminal?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If the accu&s;ation were ju&s;t, it might indeed
make you wretched: but it is Mi&s;s Margland only
who has any rea&s;on to be afflicted; for it is &s;he
alone who has been in the wrong.&endq;</P>
<P>Struck with this plain but uncontrovertible truth,
Camilla wiped her eyes, and &s;trove to recover &s;ome
compo&s;ure; but finding her tears &s;till force their
way, &startq;It is not,&endq; &s;he cried, with &s;ome he&s;itation,
&startq;it is not the a&s;per&s;ions of Mi&s;s Margland alone
that give me &s;o much vexation&mdash;the unkindne&s;s of
Indiana&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed &s;he is highly reprehen&s;ible; and &s;o I
will tell her;&mdash;but &s;till, if &s;he has any fears, how|ever
ill-founded, of lo&s;ing Edgar, you cannot but
pardon&mdash;you mu&s;t even pity her.&endq;</P>
<P>Struck again, and &s;till more forcibly, by this
&s;econd truth, Camilla, a&s;hamed of her grief, made
a &s;tronger and more &s;erious effort to repre&s;s it; and
receiving &s;oon afterwards a &s;ummons from her uncle,
her &s;pirit ro&s;e once more to the relief of her dejec|tion,
upon &s;eeing him &s;eated between Mi&s;s Mar|gland
<PB N="208" REF="17">
and Indiana, and di&s;cerning that they had
been making &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful complaint, by the air
of triumph with which they waited her approach.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Camilla,&endq; he cried, with a look of
much di&s;turbance, &startq;here's a &s;ad ado, I find; though
I don't mean to blame you, nor young Mr. Mandle|bert
neither, ta&s;te being a fault one can't avoid; not
but what a per&s;on's changing their mind is what I
can't commend in any one, which I &s;hall certainly
let him know, not doubting to bring him round by
means of his own &s;en&s;e: only, my dear, in the
mean while, I mu&s;t beg you not to &s;tand in your
cou&s;in's way.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, my dear uncle, I do not merit this im|putation;
I am not capable of &s;uch treachery!&endq;
indignantly an&s;wered Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;Treachery! Lord help us! treachery!&endq; cried
Sir Hugh, fondly embracing her, &startq;don't I know
you are as innocent as the baby unborn? and more
innocent too, from the advantage of having more
&s;en&s;e to guide you by! treachery, my dear Camilla!
why, I think there's nobody &s;o good in the wide
world!&mdash;by which I mean no reflections, never
thinking it right to make any.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana, &s;ullenly pouting, &s;poke not a word; but
Mi&s;s Margland, with a tone of plau&s;ibility that was
&s;ome covert to its malice, &s;aid &startq;Why then all may
be well, and the young ladies as good friends as
ever, and Mr. Mandlebert return to the conduct of
a gentleman, only ju&s;t by Mi&s;s Camilla's doing as &s;he
would be done by; for nothing that all of us can
&s;ay will have any effect, if &s;he does not di&s;courage
him from dangling about after her in the manner he
does now, &s;peaking to nobody el&s;e, and always a&s;k|ing
her opinion about every trifle, which is certainly
doing no great ju&s;tice to Mi&s;s Ly$mere.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana, with a to&s;s of the head, prote&s;ted his
notice was the la&s;t thing &s;he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Indiana,&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh, &startq;don't
mind all that outward &s;hew. Mr. Mandlebert is a
very good boy; and as to your cou&s;in Camilla, I am
<PB N="209" REF="18">
&s;ure I need not put you in mind how much &s;he is the
&s;ame; but I really think, whatever's the rea&s;on, the
young youths of now-a-days grow backwarder and
backwarder. Though I can't &s;ay but what in my
time it was ju&s;t the &s;ame; witne&s;s my&s;elf; which is
what I have been &s;orry for often enough, though I
have left off repenting it now, becau&s;e it's of no
u&s;e; age being a thing there's no getting ahead of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, all that remains is this,&endq; &s;aid
Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;let Mi&s;s Camilla keep out of Mr.
Mandlebert's way; and let her order the carriage,
and go to Mrs. Arlbery's to-morrow, and take no
notice of his likings and di&s;likings; and I'll be
bound for it he will &s;oon think no more of her, and
then, of cour&s;e, he will give the proper attention to
Mi&s;s Lynmere.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, if that's all,&endq; cried Sir Hugh, &startq;my dear
Camilla, I am &s;ure, will do it, and as much again
too, to make her cou&s;in ea&s;y. And &s;o now, I
hope, all is &s;ettled, and my two good girls will ki&s;s
one another, and be friends; which I am &s;ure I am
my&s;elf, with all my heart.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla hung her head, in &s;peechle&s;s perturbation,
at a ta&s;k which appeared to her equally hard and un|ju&s;t;
but while fear and &s;hame kept her &s;ilent, Sir
Hugh drew her to Indiana, and a cold, yet un|avoidable
&s;alute, gave a &s;pecies of tacit con&s;ent to
a plan which &s;he did not dare oppo&s;e, from the very
&s;trength of the de&s;ire that urged her oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>They then &s;eparated; Sir Hugh delighted, Mi&s;s
Margland triumphant, Indiana half &s;atisfied, half
affronted, and Camilla with a mind &s;o crowded, a
heart &s;o full, &s;he &s;carcely breathed. Sen&s;ations the
mo&s;t contrary, of pain, plea&s;ure, hope, and terror,
at once a&s;&s;ailed her. Edgar, of whom &s;o long &s;he
had only thought as of the de&s;tined hu&s;band of In|diana,
&s;he now heard named with &s;u&s;picions of ano|ther
regard, to which &s;he did not dare give full ex|ten&s;ion;
yet of which the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;urmi&s;e made
her con&s;ider her&s;elf, for a moment, as the happie&s;t
<PB N="210" REF="19">
of human beings, though &s;he held her&s;elf the next
as the mo&s;t culpable for even wi&s;hing it.</P>
<P>She found Eugenia &s;till in her room, who, per|ceiving
her increa&s;ed emotion, tenderly enquired, if
there were any new cau&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! yes, my deare&s;t Eugenia! they have
been exacting from me the mo&s;t cruel of &s;acrifices!
They order me to fly from Edgar Mandlebert&mdash;to
re&s;i&s;t his advice&mdash;to take the very mea&s;ures I have
promi&s;ed to forbear&mdash;to di&s;oblige, to &s;light, to be|have
to him even offen&s;ively! my uncle him&s;elf, le|nient,
kind, indulgent as he is, my uncle him&s;elf
has been prevailed with to inflict upon me this terri|ble
injunction.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My uncle,&endq; an&s;wered Eugenia, &startq;is incapable
of giving pain to any body, and lea&s;t of all to you,
whom he loves with &s;uch fondne&s;s; he has not there|fore
comprehended the affair; he only con&s;iders, in
general, that to plea&s;e or to di&s;plea&s;e Edgar man|dlebert
can be a matter of no moment to you, when
compared with its importance to Indiana.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and, a million and
a million times more important to me, than it can
ever be to her!&endq; exclaimed the ardent Camilla,
&startq;for &s;he values not his kindne&s;s, &s;he knows not his
worth, &s;he is in&s;en&s;ible to his virtues!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You judge too ha&s;tily, my dear Camilla; &s;he
has not indeed your warmth of heart; but if &s;he did
not wi&s;h the union to take place, why would &s;he
&s;hew all this di&s;quiet in the apprehen&s;ion of its
breach?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;urpri&s;ed into recollection, endeavoured
to become calmer.</P>
<P>&startq;You, indeed,&endq; continued the temperate Euge|nia,
&startq;if &s;o &s;ituated, would not &s;o have behaved;
you would not have been &s;o unju&s;t; and you could
not have been &s;o weak; but &s;till, if you had re|ceived,
however cau&s;ele&s;sly, any alarm for the af|fection
of the man you meant to marry, and that
man were as amiable as Edgar, you would have been
equally di&s;turbed.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="20">
Camilla, convinced, yet &s;hocked, felt the flutter
of her heart give a thou&s;and hues to her face, and
walking to the window, leaned far out to ga&s;p for
breath.</P>
<P>&startq;Weigh the reque&s;t more coolly, and you can|not
refu&s;e a &s;hort compliance. I am &s;ure you would
not make Indiana unhappy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, no! not for the world!&endq; cried &s;he, &s;trug|gling
to &s;eem more rea&s;onable than &s;he felt.</P>
<P>&startq;Yet how can &s;he be otherwi&s;e, if &s;he imagines
you have more of the notice and e&s;teem of Edgar
than her&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now had not a word to &s;ay; the &s;ubject
dropt; &s;he took up a book, and by earne&s;t internal
remon&s;trances, commanded her&s;elf to appear at tea-time
with tolerable &s;erenity.</P>
<P>The evening was pa&s;&s;ed in &s;piritle&s;s conver&s;ation,
or in li&s;tening to the piano-forte, upon which In|diana,
with the utmo&s;t difficulty, played &s;ome very
ea&s;y le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>At night, the following an&s;wer arrived from Dr.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Edgar Mandlebert, E&s;&abque;.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Par&s;onage Hou&s;e, Cleves,
Friday Night.
MY DEAR FRIEND,</OPENER>
<P>I mu&s;t be thankful, in a moment of &s;uch enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
that you can pay the attention of even recol|lecting
tho&s;e evils with which my zeal only has, you
think, encompa&s;&s;ed you. I cannot in&s;i&s;t upon the
practice of caution which you deem unfounded; but
as you wait my an&s;wer, I will once more open upon
my &s;entiments, and communicate my wi&s;hes. It is
now only I can &s;peak them; the in&s;tant you have
informed the young lady of your own, &s;ilences them
for ever. Your honour and her happine&s;s become
then entangled in each other, and I know not which
I would lea&s;t willingly a&s;&s;ail. What in all men is
ha&s;e, would to you, I believe, be impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;to
<PB N="212" REF="21">
trifle with &s;uch favour as may be the growth of your
own undi&s;gui&s;ed partiality.</P>
<P>Your pre&s;ent vehemence to a&s;certain the perma|nent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one you conceive formed for your
felicity, ob&s;cures, to your now ob&s;orbed faculties,
the thou&s;and namele&s;s, but tenacious, delicacies an|nexed
by your &s;pecies of character to your powers
of enjoyment. In two words, then, let me tell
you, what, in a &s;hort time, you will daily tell your|&s;elf:
you cannot be happy if not exclu&s;ively loved,
for you cannot excite, you cannot be&s;tow happine&s;s.</P>
<P>By exclu&s;ively, I do not mean to the exclu&s;ion of
other connections and regard; far from it; tho&s;e
who covet in a bride the oblivion of all former
friend&s;hips, all early affections, weaken the fine&s;t
ties of humanity, and di&s;&s;olve the fir&s;t compact of
unregi&s;tered but genuine integrity. The hu&s;band,
who would rather rationally than with romance be
loved him&s;elf, &s;hould &s;eek to cheri&s;h, not obliterate
the kind feelings of nature in its fir&s;t expan&s;ions.
The&s;e, where properly be&s;towed, are the guarantees
to that con&s;tant and re&s;pectable tenderne&s;s, which a
narrow and &s;elfi&s;h jealou&s;y rarely fails to convert into
di&s;ta&s;te and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>The partiality which I mean you to a&s;certain, in|jures
not the&s;e prior claims; I mean but a partiality
exclu&s;ive of your &s;ituation in life, and of all decla|ration
of your pa&s;&s;ion: a partiality, in fine, that is
appropriate to your&s;elf, not to the rank in the
world with which you may tempt her ambition, nor
to the blandi&s;hments of flattery, which only &s;often
the heart by intoxicating the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, therefore, if your general character, and
u&s;ual conduct, &s;trike her mind; if her e&s;teem is
yours without the attraction of a&s;&s;iduity and adula|tion;
if your natural di&s;po&s;ition and manners make
your &s;ociety grateful to her, and your approbation
de&s;irable.</P>
<P>It is thus alone you can &s;ecure your own content|ment;
for it is thus alone your reflecting mind can
<PB N="213" REF="22">
&s;natch from the time to come the dangerous &s;ur|mi&s;es
of a dubious retro&s;pection.</P>
<P>Remember, you can always advance; you can
never, in honour, go back; and believe me when I
tell you, that the mere &s;imple avowal of preference,
which only ultimately binds the man, is frequently
what fir&s;t captivates the woman. If her mind is not
previou&s;ly occupied, it operates with &s;uch &s;eductive
&s;way, it &s;o &s;oothes, &s;o flatters, &s;o betwitches her
&s;elf-complacency, that while &s;he li&s;tens, &s;he imper|ceptibly
fancies &s;he participates in &s;entiments, which,
but the minute before, occurred not even to her
imagination; and while her hand is the recompence
of her own eulogy, &s;he is not her&s;elf aware if &s;he
has be&s;towed it where her e&s;teem and regard, un|bia&s;&s;ed
by the eloquence of acknowledged admira|tion,
would have wi&s;hed it &s;ought, or if it has &s;imply
been the boon of her own gratified vanity.</P>
<P>I now no longer urge your acquie&s;cence, my dear
friend; I merely entreat you twice to peru&s;e what I
have written, and then leave you to act by the re&s;ult
of &s;uch peru&s;al.</P>
<CLOSER>I remain
Your truly faithful and obliged
<SIGNED>GABRIEL MARCHMONT.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Edgar ran through this letter with an impatience
wholly foreign to his general character. &startq;Why,&endq;
cried he, &startq;will he thus obtrude upon me the&s;e fa&s;ti|dious
doubts and cau&s;ele&s;s difficulties? I begged but
the re&s;titution of my promi&s;e, and he gives it me in
words that nearly annihilate my power of u&s;ing it.&endq;</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed and di&s;plea&s;ed, he ha&s;tily put it into
his pocket-book, re&s;olving to &s;eek Camilla, and
commit the con&s;equences of an interview to the im|pul&s;es
it might awaken.</P>
<P>He was half way down &s;tairs, when the &s;entence
fini&s;hing with, &startq;you cannot excite, you cannot
be&s;tow happine&s;s,&endq; confu&s;edly recurred to him: &startq;If
in that,&endq; thought he, &startq;I fail, I am a &s;tranger to it
my&s;elf, and a &s;tranger for ever;&endq; and, returning to
<PB N="214" REF="23">
his room, he re-opened the letter to look for the
pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The &s;entence lo&s;t nothing by being read a &s;econd
time; he pau&s;ed upon it dejectedly, and pre&s;ently
re-read the whole epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>&startq;He is not quite wrong!&endq; cried he, pen&s;ively;
&startq;there is nothing very unrea&s;onable in what he
urges: true, indeed, it is, that I can never be happy
my&s;elf, if her happine&s;s is not entwined around my
own.&endq;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t blight thus borne to that ardent glee with
which the imagination rewards its own elevated &s;pe|culations,
he yet a third time read the letter.</P>
<P>&startq;He is right!&endq; he then cried; &startq;I will inve&s;ti|gate
her &s;entiments, and know what are my chances
for her regard; what I owe to real approbation; and
what merely to intimacy of &s;ituation. I will po&s;t|pone
all explanation till my vi&s;it here expires, and
devote the probationary interval, to an examination
which &s;hall obviate all danger of either deceiving my
own rea&s;on, or of beguiling her incon&s;iderate ac|ceptance.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;ettled, he rejoiced in a ma&s;tery over his
eagerne&s;s, which he con&s;idered as complete, &s;ince it
would defer for no le&s;s than a week the declaration
of his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Author's Notion of Travelling.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning Camilla, &s;ad and unwilling to
appear, was the la&s;t who entered the breakfa&s;t-par|lour.
Edgar in&s;tantly di&s;cerned the continued un|happine&s;s,
which an a&s;&s;umed &s;mile concealed from
the un&s;u&s;picious Sir Hugh, and the week of delay
before him &s;eemed an outrage to all his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="24">
While &s;he was drinking her fir&s;t cup of tea, a
&s;ervant came in, and told her the carriage was
ready.</P>
<P>She coloured, but nobody &s;poke, and the &s;ervant
retired. Edgar was going to a&s;k the de&s;ign for the
morning, when Mi&s;s Margland &s;aid&mdash;&startq;Mi&s;s Ca|milla,
as the hor&s;es have got to go and return, you
had better not keep them waiting.&endq;</P>
<P>Colouring &s;till more deeply, &s;he was going to di&s;|claim
having ordered them, though well aware for
what purpo&s;e they were come, when Sir Hugh &s;aid
&mdash;&startq;I think, my dear, you had be&s;t take Eugenia
with you, which may &s;erve you as a companion to
talk to, in ca&s;e you want to &s;ay any thing by the
way, which I take for granted; young people not
much liking to hold their tongues for a long while
together, which is very natural, having &s;o little to
think of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;s Eugenia, then,&endq; cried Mi&s;s Margland,
before Camilla could reply, &startq;run for your cloak as
&s;oon as you have fini&s;hed your breakfa&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, hoping to aid her &s;i&s;ter in performing a
ta&s;k, which &s;he con&s;idered as a peace-offering to In|diana,
&s;aid, &s;he had already done.</P>
<P>Camilla now lo&s;t all her courage for re&s;i&s;tance; but
feeling her chag$in almo&s;t intolerable, quitted the
room with her tea undrunk, and without making
known if &s;he &s;hould return or not.</P>
<P>Eugenia followed, and Edgar, much amazed, &s;aid,
he had forgotten to order his hor&s;e for his morning's
ride, and ha&s;tily made off: determined to be ready
to hand the &s;i&s;ters to the carriage, and learn whither
it was to drive.</P>
<P>Camilla, who, in flying to her room, thought of
nothing le&s;s than preparing for an excur&s;ion which
&s;he now dete&s;ted, was again &s;urpri&s;ed in tears by
Eugenia.</P>
<P>&startq;What, my deare&s;t Camilla,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;can
thus continually affect you? you cannot be &s;o unhappy
without &s;ome cau&s;e!&mdash;why will you not tru&s;t your
Eugenia?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="25">
&startq;I cannot talk,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, a&s;hamed to repeat
rea&s;ons which &s;he knew Eugenia held to be inade|quate
to her concern&mdash;&startq;If there is no re&s;ource
again&s;t this per&s;ecution&mdash;if I mu&s;t render my&s;elf
hateful to give them &s;atisfaction, let us, at lea&s;t, be
gone immediately, and let me be &s;pared &s;eeing the
per&s;on I &s;o ungratefully offend.&endq;</P>
<P>She then hurried down &s;tairs; but finding Edgar
in waiting, &s;till more quickly hurried back, and in
an agony, for which &s;he attempted not to account,
ca&s;t her&s;elf into a chair, and told Eugenia, that if
Mi&s;s Margland did not contrive to call Edgar away,
the univer&s;e could not prevail with her to pa&s;s him in
&s;uch defiance.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Camilla,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, &s;urpri&s;ed, yet
compa&s;&s;ionately, &startq;if this vi&s;it is become &s;o painful
to you, relinqui&s;h it at once.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, no! for that cruel Mi&s;s Margland will then
accu&s;e me of &s;taying away only to follow coun&s;el
of Edgar.&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;topt; for the countenance of Eugenia &s;aid&mdash;<HI>And
is that not your motive?</HI>&endq; A &s;udden con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
took place of her di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he hid her face, in the
hope of concealing her emotion, and with as calm a
voice as &s;he could attain, &s;aid, the moment they
could pa&s;s unob&s;erved &s;he would &s;et off.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! alas!&endq; &s;he then cried, &startq;into what mi|&s;ery
has this barbarous Mi&s;s Margland thrown me!
Eugenia her&s;elf &s;eems now to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething
wrong; and &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, will my uncle; and I can
only convince them of my innocence by acting to|wards
Edgar as a mon&s;ter.&mdash;Ah! I would &s;ooner a
thou&s;and times let them all think me guilty!&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia had met Mi&s;s Margland in the hall, who,
impatient for their departure, pa&s;&s;ed her, and a&s;|cended
the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of her foot&s;teps, the horror of her
reproaches and in&s;inuations conquered every other
feeling, and Camilla, &s;tarting up, ru&s;hed forward,
and &s;aying &startq;Good morning!&endq; ran off.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="26">
Edgar was &s;till at the door, and came forward to
offer her his hand. &startq;Pray take care of Eugenia,&endq;
&s;he cried, abruptly pa&s;&s;ing him, and darting, un|aided,
into the chai&s;e. Edgar, a&s;toni&s;hed, obeyed,
and gave his more welcome a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Eugenia;
but when both were &s;eated, &s;aid&mdash;&startq;Where &s;hall I
tell the po&s;tillion to drive?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who was pulling one of the green blinds
up, and again letting it down, twenty times in a mi|nute,
affected not to hear him; but Eugenia an|&s;wered,
&startq;to the Grove, to Mrs. Arlbery's.&endq;</P>
<P>The po&s;tillion had already received his orders from
Mi&s;s Margland, and drove off; leaving Edgar mute
with &s;urprize, di&s;appointment and mortification.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland was ju&s;t behind him, and conceived
this the fortunate in&s;tant for eradicating from his
mind every favourable pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for Camilla; a&s;|&s;uming,
therefore, an air of concern, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;&startq;So,
you have found Mi&s;s Camilla out, in &s;pite of all her
precautions! &s;he would fain not have had you know
her frolic.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not know it! has there, then, been any plan?
did Mi&s;s Camilla intend&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, &s;he intends nothing in the world for two
minutes together! only &s;he did not like you &s;hould
find out her ficklene&s;s You know, I told you,
before, &s;he was all whim; and &s;o you will find. You
may always take my opinion, be a&s;&s;ured. Mi&s;s Lyn|mere
is the only one among them that is always the
&s;ame, always good, always amiable.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And is not Mi&s;s&mdash;&endq; he was going to &s;ay Ca|milla,
but checking him&s;elf&punc; fini&s;hed with&mdash;&startq;Mi&s;s
Eugenia, at lea&s;t, always equal, always con&s;i&s;tent?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, &s;he is better than Mi&s;s Camilla; but not
one among them has any &s;teadine&s;s, or real &s;weet|ne&s;s,
but Mi&s;s Lynmere. As to Mi&s;s Camilla, if
&s;he has not her own way, there's no enduring her,
&s;he frets, and is &s;o cro&s;s. When you put her off,
in that friendly manner, from gadding after a new
acquaintance &s;o improper for her, you &s;et her into
&s;uch an ill humour, that &s;he has done nothing but
<PB N="218" REF="27">
cry, as you may have &s;een by her eyes, and worry
her&s;elf and all of us round, except you, ever &s;ince;
but &s;he was afraid of you, for fear you &s;hould take
her to ta&s;k, which &s;he hates of all things.&endq;</P>
<P>Half incredulous, yet half &s;hocked, Edgar turned
from his harangue in &s;ilent di&s;gu&s;t. He knew the
&s;plenetic nature of Mi&s;s Margland, and tru&s;ted &s;he
might be wrong; but he knew, too, her opportunities
for ob&s;ervation, and dreaded le&s;t &s;he might be right.
Camilla had been certainly low &s;pirited, weeping, and
re&s;tle&s;s; was it po&s;&s;ible it could be for &s;o &s;light, &s;o
unmeaning a cau&s;e? His wi&s;h was to follow her on
hor&s;eback; but this, unauthorized, might betray
too much anxiety: he tried not to think of what had
been &s;aid by Dr. Marchmont, while this cloud hung
over her di&s;po&s;ition and &s;incerity; for whatever might
be the malignity of Mi&s;s Margland, the breach of a
promi&s;e, of which the voluntary &s;weetne&s;s had &s;o
lately proved his final captivation, could not be
doubted, and called aloud for explanation.</P>
<P>He mounted, however, his hor&s;e, to make his
promi&s;ed enquiries of Mrs. Needham; for though
the time was already pa&s;t for impeding the acquaint|ance
from taking place, its progre&s;s might yet be
&s;topt, &s;hould it be found incompatible with pro|priety.</P>
<P>The young ladies had &s;carce left the Park, when
Sir Hugh, recollecting a promi&s;e he had made to
Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold, of never &s;uffering Eugenia
to go abroad unattended by &s;ome gentleman, while
Bellamy remained in the country, &s;ent ha&s;tily to beg
that Edgar would follow the carriage.</P>
<P>Edgar was out of &s;ight, and there was no chance
of overtaking him.</P>
<P>&startq;Lack a-day!&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh, &startq;tho&s;e young
folks can never walk a hor&s;e but full gallop!&endq; He
then re&s;olved to a&s;k Dr. Orkborne to go after his
pupil, and ride by the &s;ide of the chai&s;e. He or|dered
a hor&s;e to be &s;addled; and, to lo&s;e no time by
me&s;&s;ages, the tardine&s;s of which he had already ex|perienced
with this gentleman, he went him&s;elf to
<PB N="219" REF="28">
his apartment, and after &s;everal vain rappings at his
door, entered the room unbid, &s;aying&mdash;&startq;Good Dr.
Orkborne, unle&s;s you are dead, which God forbid!
I think it's &s;omething uncomfortable that you can't
&s;peak to a per&s;on waiting at your door; not that I
pretend to doubt but you may have your proper rea|&s;ons,
being what I can't judge.&endq;</P>
<P>He then begged he would get booted and &s;purred
in&s;tantly, and follow his two nieces to Mrs. Arlbery's,
in order to take care of Eugenia; adding, &startq;though
I'm afraid, Doctor, by your look, you don't much
li&s;ten to me, which I am &s;orry for; my not being
able to &s;peak like Horace and Virgil being no fault
of mine, but my poor capacity, which no man can
be &s;aid to be an&s;werable for.&endq;</P>
<P>He then again entreated him to &s;et off.</P>
<P>&startq;Only a moment, Sir! I only beg you'll accord
me one moment!&endq; cried the Doctor&punc; with a fretful
&s;igh; while, &s;creening his eyes with his left hand,
he endeavoured ha&s;tily to make a memorandum of
his ideas, before he forced them to any other &s;ubject.</P>
<P>&startq;Really, Dr. Orkborne,&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh, &s;ome|what
di&s;plea&s;ed, &startq;I mu&s;t needs remark, for a friend,
I think this rather &s;low: however, I can't &s;ay I am
much di&s;appointed, now, that I did not turn out a
&s;cholar my&s;elf, for I &s;ee, plain enough, you learned
men think nothing of any con&s;equence but Homer
and &s;uch; which, however, I don't mean to take ill,
knowing it was like enough to have been my own
ca&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>He then left the room, intending to &s;end a man
and hor&s;e after the cha$&s;e, to de&s;ire his two nieces to
return immediately.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, who, though copiou&s;ly &s;to$ed with
the works of the ancients, had a &s;luggi&s;h under|&s;tanding,
and no imagination, was entirely $ver&s;et
by this intru&s;ion. The chain of his ob&s;ervations was
utterly broken; he &s;trove vainly to re&s;cue from ob|liviou
the &s;low ripening fruits of his tardy concep|tions,
and, proportioning his e&s;timation of their
value by their labour, he not only con&s;idered his own
<PB N="220" REF="29">
lo&s;s as irreparable, but the whole world to be injured
by &s;o unfortunate an interruption.</P>
<P>The recollection, however, which refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t
his fame, was importunate in reminding him that the
pre&s;ent offender was his patron; and his total want
of &s;kill in character kept from him the ju&s;t confidence
he would otherwi&s;e have placed in the unalterable
goodne&s;s of heart of Sir Hugh, whom, though he
de&s;pi&s;ed for his ignorance, he feared for his power.</P>
<P>Unea&s;y, therefore, at his exit, which he concluded
to be made in wrath, he uttered a dolorous groan
over his papers, and compelled him&s;elf to follow,
with an apology, the innocent enemy of his glory.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who never harboured di&s;plea&s;ure for
two minutes in his life, was more inclined to offer an
excu&s;e him&s;elf for what he had dropt again&s;t learning,
than to re&s;i&s;t the &s;lighte&s;t conce&s;&s;ion from the Doctor,
whom he only begged to make ha&s;te, the hor&s;e being
already at the door. But Dr. Orkborne, as &s;oon as
he comprehended what was de&s;ired, revived from the
weight of &s;acrificing &s;o much time; he had never
been on hor&s;eback &s;ince he was fifteen years of age,
and declared, to the wondering baronet, he could not
ri&s;k his neck by undertaking &s;uch a journey.</P>
<P>In high &s;atisfaction, he would then have returned
to his room, p$r&s;uaded that, when his mind was di&s;|embarra&s;&s;ed,
a parallel between two ancient authors
which, with much painful &s;tretch of thought, he had
&s;ugge&s;ted, and which, with the mo&s;t elaborate diffi|culty,
he was arranging and drawing up, would re|cur
again to his memory: but Sir Hugh, always
eager in expedients, &s;aid, he &s;hould follow in the
coach, which might be ready time enough for him
to arrive at Mrs. Arlber$ before the vi&s;it was over,
and to bring Eugenia &s;afe back; &startq;which,&endq; cried
he, &startq;is the main point, for the &s;ake of &s;eeing that
&s;he goes no where el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, looking extremely blank at this
unexpected propo&s;ition, &s;tood &s;till.</P>
<P>&startq;Won't you go, then, my good friend?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="30">
The Doctor, after a long pau&s;e, and in a mo&s;t de|jected
tone, &s;ighed out, &startq;Yes, Sir, certainly, with
the greate&s;t&mdash;alacrity.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who took every thing literally that
&s;eemed right or good-natured, thanked him, and or|dered
the hor&s;es to be put to the coach with all po&s;|&s;ible
expedition.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon at the door, and Dr. Orkborne, who
had &s;pent in his room the intervening period, in moan|ing
the lo&s;s of the time that was to &s;ucceed, and in
an opinion that two hours of this morning would
have been of more value to him than two years when
it was gone, reluctantly obeyed the call that obliged
him to de&s;cend: but he had no &s;ooner entered the
carriage, and found he was to have it to him&s;elf, than
leaping &s;uddenly from it, as the groom, who was to
attend him, was preparing to &s;hut the door, he ha&s;|tened
back to his chamber to collect a packet of
books and papers, through the means of which he
hoped to recall tho&s;e flowers of rhetoric, upon which
he was willing to ri&s;k his future reputation.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hed groom, concluding &s;omething had
frightened him, jumped into the coach to find the
cau&s;e of his flight; but Sir Hugh, who was advanc|ing
to give his final directions, called out, with &s;ome
di&s;plea&s;ure &startq;Hollo, there, you Jacob! if Doctor
Orkborne thinks to get you to go for my nieces in
place of him&s;elf, it's what I don't approve; which,
however, you need not take ami&s;s, one man being
no more born with a livery upon his back than an|other;
which God forbid I &s;hould think otherwi&s;e.
Neverthele&s;s, my little girls mu&s;t have a proper re|&s;pect
&s;hewn them; which, it's &s;urpri&s;ing Dr. Ork|borne
&s;hould not know as well as me&endq;</P>
<P>And, much di&s;concerted, he walked to the par|lour,
to ruminate upon &s;ome other mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;ure, your honour,&endq; &s;aid Jacob, following
him, &startq;I got in with no ill intention; but what it
was as come acro&s;s the Doctor I don't know; but
ju&s;t as I was a going to &s;hut the door, without &s;ay|ing
never a word, out he pops, and runs up &s;tairs
<PB N="222" REF="31">
again; &s;o I only got in to &s;ee if &s;omething had hurt
him; but I can't find nothing of no &s;ort.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, putting to the door, and looking &s;agaci|ou&s;ly,
&startq;Plea&s;e your honour,&endq; he continued, &startq;I
dare &s;ay it's only &s;ome maggot got into his brain from
over reading and writing; for all the maids think
he'll &s;oon be cracked.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That's very wrong of them, Jacob; and I de|&s;ire
you'll tell them they mu&s;t not think any &s;uch
thing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, your honour don't know half, or you'd
be afraid too,&endq; &s;aid Jacob, lowering his voice; &startq;he's
like nothing you ever &s;ee. He won't let a chair nor
a table be du&s;ted in his room, though they are co|vered
over with cobowebs, becau&s;e he &s;ays, it takes
him &s;uch a time to put his things to rights again;
though all the while what he calls being to rights is
ju&s;t the contrary; for it's mere higgledy piggledy,
one thing heaped o'top of t'other, as if he did it for
fun.&endq;</P>
<P>The baronet gravely an&s;wered, that if there were
not the proper &s;helves for his books he would order
more.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, your honour, that's not the quarter, as
I tell you! why, when they're cleaning out his room,
if they happen but to &s;weep away a bit of paper as
big as my hand, he'll make believe they've done him
as much mi&s;chief as if they'd &s;tole a thou&s;and pound.
It would make your honour &s;tare to hear him. Mary
&s;ays, &s;he's &s;ure he has never been quite right ever
&s;ince he come to the hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But I de&s;ire you'll tell Mary I don't approve of
that opinion. Dr. Orkborne is one of the fir&s;t
&s;cholars in the world, as I am credibly informed;
and I beg you'll all re&s;pect him accordingly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, your honour, if it i'n't owing to &s;ome|thing
of that &s;ort, why does he behave &s;o unaccount|able?
I my&s;elf heard him making &s;uch a noi&s;e at the
maids one day, that I &s;poke to Mary afterwards, and
a&s;ked her what was the matter?&mdash;&startq;Laws, nobody
knows,&endq; &s;ays &s;he, &startq;but here's the Doctor been all in
<PB N="223" REF="32">
a huff again; I was ju&s;t a du&s;ting his de&s;k (&s;ays &s;he)
and &s;o I happened to wipe down a little bundle of
papers, all nothing but mere &s;craps, and he took on
as if they'd been &s;o many guineas (&s;ays &s;he) and he
kept me there for an hour looking for them, and
&s;colding, and telling &s;uch a heap of fibs, that if he
was not out of his head, would be a &s;hame for a gen|tleman
to &s;ay (&s;ays &s;he).&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fie, fie, Jacob! and tell Mary fie, too. He is
a very learned gentleman, and no more a &s;tory-teller
than I am my&s;elf; which God forbid.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, your honour, how could this here be
true? he told the maids how they had undone him,
and the like, only becau&s;e of their throwing down
them few bits of papers; though they are ready to
make oath they picked them up, almo&s;t every one;
and that they were all of a crump, and of no manner
of u&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well, &s;ay no more about it, good Jacob,
but go and give my compliments to Dr. Orkborne,
and a&s;k him, what's the rea&s;on of his changing his
mind; I mean, provided it's no &s;ecret.&endq;</P>
<P>Jacob returned in two minutes, with uplifted hands
and eyes; &startq;your honour,&endq; cried he, &startq;now you'll
believe me another time! he is wor&s;e than ever, and
I'll be bound he'll break out before another quarter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, what's the matter?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, as &s;ure as I'm here, he's getting together
ever &s;o many books, and &s;tuffing his pockets, and
cramming them under his arms, ju&s;t as if he was a
porter! and when I gave him your honour's me&s;&s;age,
I &s;uppo&s;e it put him out, for he &s;aid, `Don't hurry
me &s;o, I'm a coming;' making believe as if he was
only a preparing for going out, in the &s;tead of mak|ing
that fool of him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, now really alarmed, bid him not men|tion
the matter to any one; and was going up &s;tairs
him&s;elf, when he &s;aw Dr. Orkborne, heavily laden
with books in each hand, and bulging from both coat
pockets, &s;lowly and carefully coming down.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="33">
&startq;Ble&s;s me,&endq; cried he, rather fearfully, &startq;my dear
Sir, what are you going to do with all that library?&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, wi&s;hing him good morning, with|out
attending to his que&s;tion, proceeded to the car|riage,
calling to Jacob, who &s;tood aloof, to make
ha&s;te and open the door.</P>
<P>Jacob obeyed, but with a &s;ignificant look at his
ma&s;ter, that &s;aid, &startq;you &s;ee how it is, Sir!&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh following him, gently put his hand upon
his &s;houlder, and mildly &s;aid, &startq;My dear friend, to
be &s;ure you know be&s;t, but I don't &s;ee the u&s;e of
loading your&s;elf in that manner for nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is a great lo&s;s of time, Sir, to travel without
books,&endq; an&s;wered the Doctor, quietly arranging them
in the coach.</P>
<P>&startq;Travel, my good friend? Why, you don't call
it travelling to go four or five miles? why, if you
had known me before my fall&mdash;However, I don't
mean to make any compari&s;ons, you gentlemen
&s;cholars being no particular good hor&s;emen. How|ever,
if you were to go one hundred miles in&s;tead of
four or five, you could not get through more than
one of tho&s;e books, read as hard as you plea&s;e; un|le&s;s
you &s;kip half, which I &s;uppo&s;e you &s;olid heads
leave to the lower ignoramu&s;&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is not for reading, Sir, that I take all the&s;e
books, but merely to look into. There are many
of them I &s;hall never read in my life, but I &s;hall
want them all.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now &s;tared with increa&s;ed perplexity;
but Dr. Orkborne, as eager to go, &s;ince his books
were to accompany him, as before to &s;tay, told Jacob
to bid the coachman make ha&s;te. Jacob looked at
his ma&s;ter, who ordered him to mount his mare, and
the carriage drove off.</P>
<P>The baronet, in &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;eated him&s;elf in
the hall, to ruminate upon what he had ju&s;t heard.
The quietne&s;s and u&s;ual manner of &s;peaking and
looking of Dr. Orkborne, which he had remarked,
removed any immediate apprehen&s;ions from the a&s;|&s;ertions
of Jacob and Mary; but &s;till he did not like
<PB N="225" REF="34">
the &s;ugge&s;tion; and the carrying off &s;o many books,
when he acknowledged he did not mean to read one
of them, di&s;turbed him.</P>
<P>In every &s;hadow of perplexity, his fir&s;t wi&s;h was
to con&s;ult with his brother; and if he had not parted
with both his carriages, he would in&s;tantly have &s;et
off for Etherington. He &s;ent, however, an expre&s;s
for Mr. Tyrold, begging to &s;ee him at Cleves with
all &s;peed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An internal Delection.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the chai&s;e drove from Cleves Park, all
attempt at any di&s;gui&s;e was over with Camilla, who
alive only to the horror of appearing ungrateful to
Edgar, wept without controul; and, leaning back
in the carriage, entreated Eugenia to di&s;pen&s;e with
all conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Eugenia, filled with pity, wondered, but com|plied,
and they travelled near four miles in &s;ilence;
when, perceiving, over the paling round a paddock,
Mrs. Arlbery and a party of company, Camilla dried
her eyes, and prepared for her vi&s;it, of which the
impetuo&s;ity of her feelings had retarded all previous
con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with true concern, &s;aw the unfitne&s;s of
her &s;i&s;ter to appear, and propo&s;ed walking the re&s;t
of the way, in the hope that a little air and exerci&s;e
might compo&s;e her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>She agreed; they alighted, and bidding the foot|man
keep with the carriage, which they ordered
&s;hould drive &s;lowly behind, they proceeded gently,
arm in arm, along a clean rai&s;ed bank by the &s;ide of
the road, with a pace &s;uiting at once the infirmity of
Eugenia, and the wi&s;h of delay in Camilla.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="35">
The &s;ound of voices reached them from within the
paddock, though a thick &s;hrubbery prevented their
&s;eeing the interlocutors.</P>
<P>&startq;Can you make out the arms?&endq; &s;aid one.</P>
<P>&startq;No;&endq; an&s;wered another, &startq;but I can &s;ee the
po&s;tillion's livery, and I am certain it is Sir Hugh
Tyrold's.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Then it is not coming hither,&endq; &s;aid a third voice,
which they recollected for Mrs. Arlbery's; &startq;we
don't vi&s;it: though I &s;hould not di&s;like to &s;ee the old
baronet. They tell me he is a humori&s;t; and I have a
ta&s;te for all oddities: but then he has a hou&s;e full of
females, and females I never admit in a morning, ex|cept
when I have &s;ecured &s;ome men to take the en|tertaining
them off my hands.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Whither is Bellamy running?&endq; cried another
voice, &startq;he's off without a word.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Gone in hopes of a rencounter, I doubt not,&endq;
an&s;wered Mrs. Arlbery; &startq;he made palpable aim at
one of the divinities of Cleves at the ball.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia now grew unea&s;y. &startq;Let us be quick,&endq;
&s;he whi&s;pered, &startq;and enter the hou&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Divinities! Lord! are they divinities?&endq; &s;aid a
girli&s;h female voice; &startq;pray how old are they?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I fancy about &s;eventeen.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Seventeen! gracious! I thought they'd been
quite young; I wonder they a'n't married!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I pre&s;ume, then, you intend to be more expe|ditious?
&s;aid another, who&s;e voice &s;poke him to be
General Kin&s;ale.</P>
<P>&startq;Gracious! I hope &s;o, for I hate an old bride.
I'll never marry at all, if I &s;tay till I am eighteen.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A &s;tory goes about,&endq; &s;aid the General, &startq;that
Sir Hugh Tyrold has &s;elected one of his nieces for
his &s;ole heire&s;s; but no two people agree which it
is; they have a&s;&s;erted it of each.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I was mightily taken with one of the girls,&endq;
&s;aid Mrs. Arlbery; &startq;there was &s;omething &s;o plea|&s;ant
in her looks and manner, that I even felt inclined
to forgive her being younger and prettier than my|&s;elf;
<PB N="227" REF="36">
but &s;he turned out al&s;o to be more whim&s;ical&mdash;
and that there was no enduring.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, extremely a&s;hamed, was now upon the
point of begging Eugenia to return, when a new
&s;peech &s;eized all her attention.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you know, General, when that beautiful
automaton, Mi&s;s Lynmere, is to marry young Man|dlebert?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Immediately, I under&s;tand; I am told he has
fitted up his hou&s;e very elegantly for her reception.&endq;</P>
<P>A deep &s;igh e&s;caped Camilla at &s;uch publicity in
the report and belief of the engagement of Edgar
with her cou&s;in, and brought with it a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
too &s;trong for any further &s;elf-di&s;gui&s;e, that her di&s;|tre&s;s
flowed not all from an unju&s;t accu&s;ation: the
&s;ound alone of the union &s;truck as a dagger at her
heart, and told her, incontrovertibly, who was its
ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Her &s;en&s;ations were now mo&s;t painful: &s;he grew
pale, &s;he became &s;ick, and was obliged, in her turn,
to lean upon Eugenia, who, affrighted to &s;ee her
thus &s;trangely di&s;ordered, be&s;ought her to go back
to the chai&s;e.</P>
<P>She con&s;ented, and begged to pa&s;s a few minutes
there alone. Eugenia therefore &s;tayed without,
walking &s;lowly upon the bank.</P>
<P>Camilla, getting into the carriage, pulled up the
blinds, and, no longer &s;elf-deceived, lamented in a
new bur&s;t of &s;orrow, her unhappy fate, and unpro|pitious
attachment.</P>
<P>This con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, however, became &s;oon a call
upon her integrity, and her regret was &s;ucceeded
by a &s;ummons upon propriety. She gave her&s;elf up
as lo&s;t to all per&s;onal felicity, but hoped &s;he had di&s;|covered
the tendency of her affliction, in time to
avoid the dangers, and the errors to which it might
lead. She determined to &s;truggle without ce&s;&s;ation
for the conque&s;t of a partiality &s;he deemed it trea|chery
to indulge; and to appea&s;e any pain &s;he now
blu&s;hed to have cau&s;ed to Indiana, by &s;trictly follow|ing
the hard pre&s;cription of Mi&s;s Margland, and the
<PB N="228" REF="37">
obvious opinion of Eugenia, in &s;hunning the &s;ociety,
and no longer coveting the approbation of Edgar.
&startq;Such, my dear father,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;would be your
le&s;&s;on, if I dared con&s;ult you! &s;uch, my mo&s;t ho|noured
mother, would be your conduct, if thus
cruelly &s;ituated!&endq;</P>
<P>This thought thrilled through every vein with
plea&s;ure, in a &s;en&s;e of filial de&s;ert, and her &s;ole de|&s;ire
was to return immediately to tho&s;e incomparable
parents, under who&s;e roof &s;he had experienced no|thing
but happine&s;s, and in who&s;e bo&s;oms &s;he hoped
to bury every tumultuous di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas and re&s;olutions, dejecting, yet &s;olacing,
occupied her to the forgetfulne&s;s of her intended
vi&s;it, and even of Eugenia, till the words: &startq;Pray
let me come to you, my dear Camilla!&endq; made her
let down the blinds.</P>
<P>She then perceived Mr. Bellamy earne&s;tly addre&s;&s;|ing
her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>He had advanced &s;uddenly towards her, by a &s;hort
cut from the paddock, of which &s;he was not aware,
when &s;he was about twenty yards from the chai&s;e.</P>
<P>She made an effort to avoid him; but he planted
him&s;elf in the way of her retreat, though with an
air of &s;upplication, with which &s;he &s;trove in vain to
be angry.</P>
<P>He warmly repre&s;ented the cruelty of thus flying
him, entreated but the privilege of addre&s;&s;ing her as
a common acquaintance; and promi&s;ed, upon that
condition, to &s;ubmit unmurmuring to her rejection.</P>
<P>Eugenia, though in &s;ecret &s;he thought this reque&s;t
but equitable, made him no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>&startq;O madam,&endq; he cried, &startq;what have I not &s;uf|fered
&s;ince your barbarous letter! why will you be
&s;o amiable, yet &s;o inexorable?&endq;</P>
<P>She attempted to quicken her pace; but again,
in the &s;ame manner, &s;topping her, he exclaimed;
&startq;Do not kill me by this di&s;dain! I a&s;k not now for
favour or encouragement&mdash;I know my hard doom&mdash;I
a&s;k only to conver&s;e with you&mdash;though, alas! it
was by conver&s;ing with you I lo&s;t my heart.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="38">
Eugenia felt &s;oftened; and her countenance, which
had forfeited nothing of expre&s;&s;ion, though every
thing of beauty, &s;oon &s;hewed Bellamy his advantage.
He pur&s;ued it eagerly; depicted his pa&s;&s;ion, depre|cated
her &s;everity, extolled her virtues and accom|pli&s;hments,
and bewailed his unhappy, hopele&s;s flame.</P>
<P>Eugenia, knowing that all &s;he &s;aid, and believing
that all &s;he heard i&s;&s;ued from the fountain of truth,
became extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. &startq;Let me pa&s;s, I con|jure
you, Sir,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;and do not take it ill&mdash;but
I cannot hear you any longer.&endq;</P>
<P>The vivacity of bright hope fla&s;hed into the &s;park|ling
eyes of Bellamy, at &s;o gentle a remon&s;trance;
and entreaties for lenity, declarations of pa&s;&s;ion, pro|fe&s;&s;ions
of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and practice of re&s;i&s;tance, a&s;|&s;ailed
the young Eugenia with a rapidity that con|founded
her: &s;he heard him with &s;carce any oppo|&s;ition,
from a fear of irritating his feelings, joined
to a juvenile embarra&s;&s;ment how to treat with more
&s;everity &s;o &s;incere and &s;o humble a &s;uppliant.</P>
<P>From this &s;ituation, to the extreme provocation of
Bellamy, &s;he was relieved by the appearance of Major
Cerwood, who having ob&s;erved, from the paddock,
the &s;low motion of the carriage, had come forth to
find out the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Eugenia &s;eized the moment of interruption to
pre&s;s forward, and make the call to her &s;i&s;ter already
mentioned; Bellamy accompanying and pleading,
but no longer venturing to &s;top her: he handed her,
therefore, to the chai&s;e, where Major Cerwood al&s;o
paid his compliments to the two ladies; and hearing
they were going to the &s;eat of Mrs. Arlbery, whi|ther
Camilla now forced her&s;elf, though more un|willingly
than ever, he ran on, with Bellamy, to be
ready to hand them from the carriage.</P>
<P>They were &s;hewn into a parlour, while a &s;ervant
went into the garden to call his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This interval was not neglected by either of the
gentlemen, for Bellamy was &s;carce more eager to en|gage
the attention of Eugenia, than the Major to
force that of Camilla. By Lionel he had been in|formed
<PB N="230" REF="39">
&s;he was heire&s;s of Cleves; he deemed, there|fore,
the opportunity by no means to be thrown away,
of making, what he believed required opportunity
alone, a conque&s;t of her young heart. Accu&s;tomed
to think compliments always welcome to the fair, he
con&s;trued her &s;adne&s;s into &s;oftne&s;s, and imputed her
&s;ilence to the confu&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion made upon an in|experienced
rural beauty, by the fir&s;t a&s;&s;iduities of a
man of figure and gallantry.</P>
<P>In about a quarter of an hour the &s;ervant of Mrs.
Arlbery &s;lowly returned, and, with &s;ome he&s;itation,
&s;aid his lady was not at home. The gentlemen looked
provoked, and Camilla and Eugenia, much di&s;con|certed
at &s;o evident a denial, left their names, and
returned to their carriage.</P>
<P>The journey back to Cleves was mute and dejected:
Camilla was &s;hocked at the con&s;cious &s;tate of her
own mind, and Eugenia was equally pen&s;ive. She
began to think with anxiety of a contract with a
per&s;on wholly unknown, and to con&s;ider the pa&s;&s;ion
and con&s;tancy of Bellamy as the emanations of a truly
elevated mind, and meriting her mo&s;t &s;erious gra|titude.</P>
<P>At the hall door they were eagerly met by Sir
Hugh, who, with infinite &s;urpri&s;e, enquired where
they had left Dr. Orkborne.</P>
<P>&startq;Dr. Orkborne?&endq; they repeated, &startq;we have not
even &s;een him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not &s;een him? did not he come to fetch you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Sir.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, he went to Mrs. Arlbery's on purpo&s;e!
And what he &s;tays for at that lady's, now you are
both come away, is a thing I can't pretend to judge
of; unle&s;s he has &s;topt to read one of tho&s;e books he
took with him; which is what I dare &s;ay is the ca&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He cannot be at Mrs. Arlbery's, Sir,&endq; &s;aid
Eugenia, &startq;for we have but this moment left her
hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He mu&s;t be there, my dear girls, for he's no
where el&s;e. I &s;aw him &s;et out my&s;elf, which, how|ever,
<PB N="231" REF="40">
I &s;han't mention the particulars of, having &s;ent
for my brother, whom I expect every minute.&endq;</P>
<P>They then concluded he had gone by another road,
as there were two ways to the Grove.</P>
<P>Edgar did not return to Cleves till the family were
a&s;&s;embling to dinner. His vi&s;it to Mrs. Needham
had occa&s;ioned him a new di&s;turbance. She had
rallied him upon the general rumour of his approach|ing
marriage; and his confu&s;ion, from believing his
partiality for Camilla detected, was con&s;trued into a
confirmation of the report concerning Indiana. His
di&s;avowal was rather &s;erious than &s;trong, and invo|luntarily
mixt with &s;uch warm eulogiums of the ob|ject
he imagined to be meant, that Mrs. Needham,
who had only named <HI>a certain fair one at Cleves,</HI>
laughed at his denial, and thought the engagement
undoubted.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to his enquiries relative to Mrs. Arl|bery,
Mrs. Needham &s;aid, that &s;he was a woman far
more agreeable to the men, than to her own &s;ex;
that &s;he was full of caprice, coquetry, and &s;ingu|larity;
yet, though &s;he abu&s;ed the gift, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
an excellent and uncommon under&s;tanding. She was
guilty of no vices, but utterly carele&s;s of appear|ances,
and though her character was wholly unim|peached,
&s;he had offended or frightened almo&s;t all the
county around, by a wilful &s;trangene&s;s of behaviour,
re&s;ulting from an undaunted determination to follow
in every thing the bent of her own humour.</P>
<P>Edgar ju&s;tly deemed this a dangerous acquaintance
for Camilla, who&s;e natural thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and vi|vacity
made him dread the lea&s;t imprudence in the
connexions &s;he might form; yet, as the reputation
of Mrs. Arlbery was un&s;ullied, he felt how difficult
would be the ta&s;k of demon&s;trating the perils he
feared.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, during the dinner, was exceedingly
di&s;turbed. &startq;What Dr. Orkborne can be doing with
him&s;elf,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;is more than any man can tell,
for he certainly would not &s;tay at that lady's, when
he found you were both come away; &s;o that I begin
<PB N="232" REF="41">
to think it's ten to one but he's gone nobody knows
where! for why el&s;e &s;hould he take all tho&s;e books?
which is a thing I have been thinking of ever &s;ince;
e&s;pecially as he owned him&s;elf he &s;hould never read
one half of them. If he has taken &s;omething ami&s;s,
I am very ready to a&s;k his pardon; though what it
can be I don't pretend to gue&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland &s;aid, he was &s;o often doing &s;ome|thing
or other that was ill-bred, that &s;he was not at
all &s;urpri&s;ed he &s;hould &s;tay out at dinner time. He
had never yet &s;etched her a chair, nor opened the
door for her, &s;ince he came to the hou&s;e; &s;o that &s;he
did not know what was too bad to expect.</P>
<P>As they were ri&s;ing from the table, a note arrived
from Mr. Tyrold, with an excu&s;e, that important
bu&s;ine&s;s would prevent his coming to Cleves till the
next day. Camilla then begged permi&s;&s;ion to go in
the chai&s;e that was to fetch him, flattering her&s;elf
&s;omething might occur to detain her, when at Ether|ington.
Sir Hugh readily a&s;&s;ented, and compo&s;ing
him&s;elf for his afternoon nap, de&s;ired to be awaked if
Dr. Orkborne came back.</P>
<P>All now left the room except Camilla, who, taking
up a book, &s;tood &s;till at a window, till &s;he was arou&s;ed
by the voice of Edgar, who, from the Park, a&s;ked
her what &s;he was reading.</P>
<P>She turned over the leaves, a&s;hamed at the que&s;|tion,
to look for the title; &s;he had held the book
mechanically, and knew not what it was.</P>
<P>He then produced the promi&s;ed no&s;egay, which
had been brought by his gardener during her excur|&s;ion.
She &s;oftly lifted up the &s;a&s;h, pointing to her
&s;leeping uncle; he gave it her with a &s;ilent little
bow, and walked away; much di&s;appointed to mi&s;s
an opportunity from which he had hoped for &s;ome
explanation.</P>
<P>She held it in her hand &s;ome time, &s;carcely &s;en|&s;ible
&s;he had taken it, till, pre&s;ently, &s;he &s;aw its buds
bedewed with her falling tears.</P>
<P>She &s;hook them off, and pre&s;&s;ed the no&s;egay to her
bo&s;om. &startq;This, at lea&s;t,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;I may ac|cept,
<PB N="233" REF="42">
for it was offered me before that barbarous at|tack.
Ah! they know not the innocence of my
regard, or they would not &s;o wrong it! The uni|ver&s;e
could not tempt me to injure my cou&s;in, though
it is true, I have valued the kindne&s;s of Edgar&mdash;and
I mu&s;t always value it!&mdash;The&s;e flowers are more
precious to me, coming from his hands, and reared
in his grounds, than all the gems of the Ea&s;t could
be from any other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. But where is the guilt
of &s;uch a preference? And who that knows him
could help feeling it?&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now awakening from a &s;hort &s;lumber,
exclaimed&mdash;&startq;I have ju&s;t found out the rea&s;on why
this poor gentleman has made off; I mean, provided
he is really gone away, which, however, I hope not:
but I think, by his bringing down all tho&s;e books,
he meant to give me a broad hint, that he had got
no proper book-ca&s;e to keep them in; which the
maids as good as think too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Then, calling upon Camilla, he a&s;ked if &s;he was
not of that opinion.</P>
<P>&startq;Y&mdash;e&mdash;s, Sir,&endq; &s;he he&s;itatingly an&s;wered.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, my dear, if we all think the &s;ame,
I'll give orders immediately for getting the better of
that fault.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, curious to know how Camilla was
detained, now re-entered the room. Struck with
the fond and melancholy air with which &s;he was
bending over her no&s;egay, &s;he abruptly demanded&mdash;
&startq;Pray, where might you get tho&s;e flowers?&endq;</P>
<P>Covered with &s;hame, &s;he could make no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>&startq;O, Mi&s;s Camilla! Mi&s;s Camilla!&mdash;ought not
tho&s;e flowers to belong to Mi&s;s Lynmere?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Mandlebert had promi&s;ed me them ye&s;ter|day
morning,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, in a voice &s;carce au|dible.</P>
<P>&startq;And is this fair, Ma'am?&mdash;can you reckon it
honourable?&mdash;I'll be judged by Sir Hugh him&s;elf.
Do you think it right, Sir, that Mi&s;s Camilla &s;hould
accept no&s;egays every day from Mr. Mandlebert,
when her cou&s;in has had never a one at all?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="43">
&startq;Why, it's not her fault, you know, Mi&s;s Mar|gland,
if young Mr. Mandlebert chu&s;es to give them
to her. However, if that vexes Indiana, I'm &s;ure
my niece will make them over to her, with the
greate&s;t plea&s;ure; for I never knew the thing &s;he
would not part with, much more a mere little &s;mell
at the no&s;e, which, whether one has it or not, can't
much matter after it's over.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland now exultingly held out her hand:
the deci&s;ion was obliged to be prompt; Camilla de|livered
up the flowers, and ran into her own room.</P>
<P>The &s;acrifice, cried &s;he, is now complete! Edgar
will conclude I hate him, and believe Indiana loves
him!&mdash;no matter!&mdash;it is fitting he &s;hould think both.
I will be &s;teady this la&s;t evening, and to-morrow I
will quit this fatal roof!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Author's Opinion of Vi&s;iting.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN &s;ummoned to tea, Camilla, upon enter|ing
the parlour, found Sir Hugh in mournful di&s;|cour&s;e
with Edgar upon the non-appearance of Dr.
Orkborne. Edgar felt a momentary di&s;appointment
that &s;he did not honour his flowers with wearing
them; but con&s;oled him&s;elf with &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he had
pre&s;erved them in water. In a few minutes, how|ever,
Indiana appeared with them in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t petrified, he turned towards Camilla, who,
affecting an air of unconcern, amu&s;ed her&s;elf with
patting a favourite old terrier of her uncle's.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he could di&s;engage him&s;elf from the
Baronet, he leant al&s;o over the dog, and, in a low
voice, &s;aid&mdash;&startq;You have di&s;carded, then, my poor
flowers?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have I not done right?&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, in the
&s;ame tone; &startq;are they not where you mu&s;t be far
happier to &s;ee them?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="44">
&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible,&endq; exclaimed he, &startq;Mi&s;s Camilla
Tyrold can &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;&endq; He &s;topt, for &s;urpri&s;ed off
his guard, he was &s;peaking loud, and he &s;aw Mi&s;s
Margland approaching.</P>
<P>&startq;Don't you think, Mr. Mandlebert,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,
&startq;that Mi&s;s Lynmere becomes a bouquet very much?
&s;he took a fancy to tho&s;e flowers, and I think they
are quite the thing for her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She does them,&endq; he coldly an&s;wered, &startq;too
much honour.&endq;</P>
<P>Ah, Heaven! he loves her not! thought Camilla,
and, while trembling between hope and terror at the
&s;ugge&s;tion, determined to redouble her circum&s;pec|tion,
not to confirm the &s;u&s;picion that his indiffer|ence
was produced by her efforts to attach him to
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She had &s;oon what &s;he conceived to be an occa&s;ion
for its exertion. When he handed her &s;ome cakes,
he &s;aid&mdash;&startq;You would think it, I conclude, imper|tinent
to hear any thing more concerning Mrs. Arl|bery,
now you have po&s;itively opened an acquaint|ance
with her?&endq;</P>
<P>She felt the ju&s;tice of this implied reproach of her
broken promi&s;e; but &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf con&s;tantly
watched by Mi&s;s Margland, and repre&s;&s;ing the apo|logy
&s;he was &s;ighing to offer, only an&s;wered&mdash;&startq;You
have nothing, you own, to &s;ay again&s;t her reputa|tion&mdash;and
as to any thing el&s;e&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;True,&endq; interrupted he, &startq;my information on
that point is all &s;till in her favour: but can it be Mi&s;s
Camilla Tyrold, who holds that to be the &s;ole que&s;|tion
upon which intimacy ought to depend? Does
&s;he account as nothing manners, di&s;po&s;ition, way of
life?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, not ab&s;olutely as nothing,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, ri&s;ing;
&startq;but ta&s;te &s;ettles all tho&s;e things, and mine is en|tirely
in her favour.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar gravely begged her pardon, for &s;o offici|ou&s;ly
re&s;uming an irk&s;ome &s;ubject; and returning to
Sir Hugh, endeavoured to li&s;ten to his lamentations
and conjectures about Dr. Orkborne.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="45">
He felt, however, deeply hurt. In naming Mrs.
Arlbery, he had flattered him&s;elf he had opened an
opportunity for which &s;he mu&s;t her&s;elf be waiting, to
explain the motives of her late vi&s;it: but her light
an&s;wer put an end to that hope, and her quitting her
&s;eat &s;hewed her impatient of further coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Not a word that fell from Sir Hugh reached his
ear: but he bowed from time to time, and the good
Baronet had no doubt of his attention. His eyes
were perpetually following Camilla, though they met
not a glance from her in return. She played with
the terrier, talked with Eugenia, looked out of the
window, turned over &s;ome books, and did every thing
with an air of negligence, that, while it covered ab|&s;ence
and anxiety, di&s;played a &s;tudied avoidance of
his notice.</P>
<P>The le&s;s he could account for this, the more it of|fended
him. And dwells caprice, thought he, while
his eye followed her, even there! in that fair com|po&s;ition!&mdash;
where may I look for &s;inglene&s;s of mind,
for noblene&s;s of &s;implicity, if caprice, mere girli&s;h,
unmeaning caprice, dwell there!</P>
<P>The moment &s;he had fini&s;hed her tea, &s;he left the
room, to &s;horten her cruel ta&s;k. Struck with the
broken &s;entence of &startq;is it po&s;&s;ible Mi&s;s Camilla Ty|rold
can &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;&endq; the &s;oft hope that his heart
was untouched by Indiana, &s;eized her delighted ima|gination;
but the recollection of Mi&s;s Margland's
a&s;&s;ertions, that it was the real right of her cou&s;in,
&s;oon robbed the hope of all happine&s;s, and &s;he could
only repeat&mdash;To-morrow I will go!&mdash;I ought not to
think of him!&mdash;I had rather be away&mdash;to-morrow
I will go!</P>
<P>She had hardly quitted the parlour, when the di&s;|tant
&s;ound of a carriage rou&s;ed Sir Hugh from his
fears; and, followed by Edgar and the ladies, he
made what ha&s;te he could into the court-yeard, where,
to his infinite &s;atisfaction, he &s;aw his coach driving
in.</P>
<P>He ordered it &s;hould &s;top immediately, and called
out&mdash;&startq;Pray, Dr. Orkborne, are you there?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="46">
Dr. Orkborne looked out of the window, and
bowed re&s;pectfully.</P>
<P>&startq;Good lack, I could never have thought I &s;hould
be &s;o glad to &s;ee you! which you mu&s;t excu&s;e, in
point of being no relation. You are heartily wel|come,
I a&s;&s;ure you; I was afraid I &s;hould never &s;ee
you again; for, to tell you the hone&s;t truth, which
I would not &s;ay a word of before, I had got a notion
you were going out of your mind.&endq;</P>
<P>The Doctor took not the &s;malle&s;t heed of this
&s;peech, and the carriage drove up to the door. Sir
Hugh then &s;eating him&s;elf under the portico, &s;aid&mdash;
&startq;Pray, Dr. Orkborne, before you go to your &s;tudies,
may I ju&s;t a&s;k you how you came to &s;tay out all day?
and why you never fetched Eugenia? for I take it
for granted it's no &s;ecret, on the account Jacob was
with you; be&s;ides the coachman and hor&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, though not at all di&s;compo&s;ed by
the&s;e que&s;tions, nor by his reception, an&s;wered, that
he mu&s;t fir&s;t collect his books.</P>
<P>&startq;The poor girls,&endq; continued the Baronet, &startq;came
home quite blank; not that they knew a word of
my a&s;king you to go for them, till I told them;
which was lucky enough, for the &s;ake of not frighten|ing
them. However, where you can have been,
particularly with regard to your dinner, which&punc; I &s;up|po&s;e,
you have gone without, is what I can't gue&s;s;
unle&s;s you'd be kind enough to tell me.&endq;</P>
<P>The Doctor, too bu&s;y to hear him, was packing
up his books.</P>
<P>&startq;Come, never mind your books,&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh;
&startq;Jacob can carry them for you, or Bob, or any body.
Here, Bob, (calling to the po&s;tillion, who, with all the
re&s;t of the &s;ervants, had been drawn by curio&s;ity into the
court-yard) whi&s;k me up tho&s;e books, and take them
into the Doctor's room; I mean, provided you can
find a place for them, which I am &s;orry to &s;ay there
is none; owing to my not knowing better in point
of taking the proper care; which I &s;hall be &s;ure to
do for the future.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="47">
The boy obeyed, and mounting one &s;tep of he
coach, took what were within his reach; which, when
the Doctor ob&s;erved, he &s;natched away with great
di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;aying, very &s;olemnly, he had rather at
any time be knocked down, than &s;ee any body touch
one of his books or papers.</P>
<P>Jacob, coming forward, whi&s;pered his ma&s;ter not
to interfere; a&s;&s;uring him, he was but ju&s;t got out of
one of his tantarums.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, a little &s;tartled, ro&s;e to return to the
parlour, begging Dr. Orkborne to take his own time,
and not to hurry him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He then beckoned Jacob to follow him.</P>
<P>&startq;There is certainly &s;omething in all this,&endq; &s;aid he
to Edgar, &startq;beyond what my poor wit can compre|hend:
but I'll hear what Jacob has to &s;ay before I
form a complete judgment; though, to be &s;ure, his
lugging out all tho&s;e books to go but four or five
miles, has but an odd look; which is what I don't
like to &s;ay.&endq;</P>
<P>Jacob now was called upon to give a narrative of
the day's adventures. &startq;Why, your Honour,&endq; &s;aid
he, as &s;oon as we come to the Grove, &startq;I goes up to
the coach door, to a&s;k the Doctor if he would get
out&punc; or only &s;end in to let the young ladies know he
was come for them; but he was got &s;o deep into
&s;ome of his larning, that, I dare &s;ay&punc; I bawled it
three good times in his ears, before he &s;o much as
lifted up his head; and then it was only to &s;ay, I put
him out! and to it he went again, ju&s;t as if I'd &s;aid
never a word; till, at la&s;t, I was &s;o plaguy mad, I
gives the coach &s;uch a jog, o bring him to him&s;elf
like, that it jerked the pencil and paper out of his
hand So then he went &s;traight into one of his
takings, pretending I had made him forget all his
thoughts, and &s;uch like out of the way talk, after
his old way. So when I found he was going off in
that manner, I thought it only time lo&s;t to &s;ay no
more to him, and &s;o I turned me about not to mind
him; when I &s;ees a whole heap of company at a
parlour window, laughing &s;o hearty, that I was &s;ure
<PB N="239" REF="48">
they had heard us. And a fine comely lady, as
clever as ever you &s;ee, that I found after was the lady
of the hou&s;e, bid me come to the window, and
a&s;ked what I wanted. So I told her we was come
for two of the Mi&s;s Tyrolds. Why, &s;ays &s;he,
they've been gone a quarter of an hour, by the op|po&s;ite
road. So then I was coming away, but &s;he
made me a &s;ign to come into the parlour, for all it
was brimful of fine company, dre&s;&s;ed all like I don't
know what. It was as pretty a &s;ight as you'd wi&s;h
to &s;ee. And then, your honour, they all begun
upon me at once! There was &s;uch a clatter, I
thought I'd been turned into a booth at a fair; and
merry enough they all was &s;ure!&mdash;'&s;pecially the lady,
who never opened her lips, but what they all
laughed: but as to all what they a&s;ked me, I could
as &s;oon conjure a gho&s;t as call a quarter of it to
mind.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Try, however,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, curious for fur|ther
information of whatever related to Mrs.
Arlbery.</P>
<P>&startq;Why as to that, '&s;quire,&endq; an&s;wered Jacob,
with an arch look, &startq;I am not &s;o &s;ure and certain
you'd like to hear it all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No? and why not?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! pray tell, Jacob,&endq; cried Mi&s;s Margland;
&startq;did they &s;ay any thing of Mr. Mandlebert?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, and of more than Mr. Mandlebert,&endq; &s;aid
Jacob, grinning.</P>
<P>&startq;Do tell, do tell,&endq; cried Indiana, eagerly.</P>
<P>&startq;I'm afeard, Mi&s;s!&endq;</P>
<P>Every body a&s;&s;ured him $o offence &s;hould be
taken.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, if you mu&s;t needs know&punc; there
was not one of you, but what they had a pluck at.&mdash;Pray,
&s;ays one of them, what does the old gen|tleman
do with all tho&s;e books and papers in the
coach?&mdash;That's what nobody knows, &s;ays I, unle&s;s
his head's cracked, which is Mary's opinion.&mdash;Then
they all laughed more and more, and the lady of the
hou&s;e &s;aid:&mdash;Pray can he really read?&mdash;Whoo!
<PB N="240" REF="49">
&s;ays I, why he does nothing el&s;e; he's at it from
morning till night, and Mary &s;ays &s;he's &s;ure before
long he'll give up his meat and drink for it.&mdash;I've al|ways
heard he was a quiz, &s;ays another, or a quoz,
or &s;ome &s;uch word; but I did not know he was &s;uch
a book-worm.&mdash;The old quoz is generous, however,
I hear, &s;ays another, pray do you find him &s;o?&mdash;As
to that, I can't &s;ay, &s;ays I, for I never &s;ee the co|lour
of his money.&mdash;No! then, what are you &s;uch
a fool as to &s;erve him for?&mdash;So, then, your honour,
I found, owing to the coach and the arms, and the
like, they thought all the time it was your honour
was in the coach. I hope your honour don't take it
ami&s;s of me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not at all, Jacob; only I don't know why they
call me an old quiz and quoz for; never having of|fended
them; which I take rather unkind; e&s;pe|cially
not knowing what it means.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, your honour, they're &s;uch comical &s;ort
of folks; they don't mind what they &s;ay of no|body.
Not but what the lady of the hou&s;e is a rare
gentlewoman. Your honour could not help liking
her. I warrant &s;he's made many a man's heart
ache, and then jumped for joy when &s;he'd done.
And as to her eyes, I think in my born days I never
&s;ee nothing like 'em: they &s;hines like two candles
on a dark night afar off on the common&mdash;.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why Jacob,&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh, &startq;I &s;ee you have
lo&s;t your heart. However, go on.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, as &s;oon as I found out what they
meant&mdash;That my ma&s;ter? &s;ays I, no, God be
thanked! What &s;hould I have to live upon if a was?
Not &s;o much as a cobweb! for there would not be
wherewithal for a &s;pider to make it.&endq;</P>
<P>Here Sir Hugh, with much di&s;plea&s;ure, inter|rupted
him; &startq;As to the poor gentleman's being
poor,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;it's no fault of his own, for he'd
be rich if he could, I make no doubt; never having
heard he was a gambler. Be&s;ides which, I alway$
re&s;pect a man the more for being poor, knowing how
<PB N="241" REF="50">
little a rich man may have in him; which I can
judge by my own ca&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Jacob proceeded.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, if it is not Sir Hugh, &s;ays one of them,
who is it?&mdash;Why, it's only our Latin ma&s;ter, &s;ays
I; upon which they all &s;et up as jolly a laugh again
as ever I heard in my days. Jobbins, they're pure
merry!&mdash;And who learns Latin? &s;ays one, I hope
they don't let him work at poor old Sir Hugh? No,
&s;ays I, they tried their hands with him at fir&s;t, but
he thanked 'em for nothing. He &s;oon grew tired
on't.&mdash;So then they &s;aid, who learns now, &s;ays they,
do you?&mdash;Me! &s;ays I, no God be prai&s;ed, I don't
know <HI>A</HI> from <HI>B,</HI> which is the way my head's &s;o
clear, never having muddled it with what I don't
under&s;tand.&mdash;And &s;o then they all &s;aid I was a brave
fellow; and they ordered me a gla&s;s of wine.&endq;</P>
<P>What a &s;et! thought Edgar, is this, idle, di&s;&s;i|pated,
curious&mdash;for Camilla to a&s;&s;ociate with!&mdash;the
lively, the unthinking, the inexperienced Camilla!</P>
<P>&startq;So then they a&s;ked me, &s;ays they, does Mi&s;s
Lynmere learn, &s;ays they?&mdash;Not, as I know of,
&s;ays I, &s;he's no great turn for her book, as ever I
heard of; which I hope Mi&s;s you won't take ill,
for they all &s;aid, no, to be &s;ure, &s;he's too hand&s;ome
for that.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana looked uncertain whether to be flattered
or offended.</P>
<P>&startq;But you have not told us what they &s;aid of Mr.
Mandlebert yet?&endq; cried Mi&s;s Margland.</P>
<P>&startq;No, I mu&s;t come to you fir&s;t, Mi&s;s,&endq; an&s;wered
he, &startq;for that's what they come upon next. But
may hap I mu&s;t not tell?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes, you may;&endq; &s;aid &s;he, growing a little
apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome affront, but determined not to
&s;eem hurt by it; &startq;I am very indifferent to any thing
they can &s;ay of me, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ays they, this Latin ma&s;ter
&s;tudies chiefly with the governe&s;s?&mdash;They'd &s;tudy
fifty-cuffs I believe, if they did, &s;ays I, for &s;he
<PB N="242" REF="51">
hates him like poi&s;on; and there's no great love lo&s;t
between them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what right had you to &s;ay that, Mr.
Jacob? I did not a&s;k what you &s;aid. Not that I
care, I promi&s;e you!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, &s;ome how, they got it all out; they
were &s;o merry and &s;o full of their fun, I could not
be behind hand. But I hope no offence?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O dear no! I'm &s;ure it's not worth while.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They &s;aid wor&s;e than I did,&endq; re&s;umed Jacob,
&startq;by a deal; they &s;aid, &s;ays they, &s;he looks duced
crabbed&mdash;&s;he looks ju&s;t as if &s;he was always eating a
&s;our apple, &s;ays the lady; &s;he looks&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well, I don't want to hear any more of
their opinions. I may look as I plea&s;e I hope. I
hate &s;uch go&s;&s;iping.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So then they &s;aid, pray does Mi&s;s Camilla
learn? &s;ays they;&mdash;Lord love her, no! &s;ays I.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what &s;aid they to that?&endq; cried Edgar.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, they &s;aid, they hoped not, and they
were glad to hear it, for they liked her the be&s;t of
all. And what does the ugly one do? &s;ays they.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come, we have heard enough now,&endq; inter|rupted
Edgar, greatly &s;hocked for poor Eugenia,
who fortunately, however, had retired with Camilla.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh too, angrily broke in upon him, &s;ay|ing:
&startq;I won't have my niece called ugly, Jacob!
you know it's again&s;t my commands &s;uch a thing's
being mentioned.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, I told 'em &s;o, Sir,&endq; &s;aid Jacob; &startq;ugly
one, &s;ays I, &s;he you call the ugly one, is one of the
be&s;t ladies in the land. She's ready to lend a hand
to every mortal &s;oul; &s;he's ju&s;t like my ma&s;ter for
that. And as to learning, I make no quaery &s;he can
talk you over the Latin grammar as fa&s;t as e'er a gen|tleman
here. So then they laughed harder than
ever, and &s;aid they &s;hould be&punc; afeard to &s;peak to her,
and a deal more I can't call to mind.&mdash;So then they
come to Mr. Mandlebert. Pray, &s;ays they, what's
he doing among you all this time?&mdash;Why, nothing
particular, &s;ays I, he's only &s;quiring about our
<PB N="243" REF="52">
young ladies.&mdash;But when is this wedding to be? &s;ays
another. So then I &s;aid&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What did you &s;ay?&endq; cried Edgar ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>&startq;Why&mdash;nothing,&endq; an&s;wered Jacob, drawing
back.</P>
<P>&startq;Tell us, however, what they &s;aid,&endq; cried Mi&s;s
Margland.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, they &s;aid, &s;ays they, every thing has
been ready &s;ome time at Beech Park;&mdash;and they'll
make as hand&s;ome a couple as ever was &s;een.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What &s;tuff is this!&endq; cried Edgar, &startq;do
prithee have done.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland; &startq;go on,
Jacob!&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana, con&s;cious and glowing at the words
hand&s;ome couple, could not re&s;train a &s;imper; but
Edgar, thinking only of Camilla, did not under|&s;tand
it.</P>
<P>&startq;He'll have trouble enough, &s;ays one of the
gentlemen,&endq; continues Jacob, &startq;to take care of &s;o
pretty a wife.&mdash;She'll be worth a little trouble, &s;ays
another, for I think &s;he is the mo&s;t beautifulle&s;t girl
I ever &s;ee&mdash;Take my word of it, &s;ays the lady of
the hou&s;e, young Mandlebert is a man who won't be
made a fool of; he'll have his own way, for all her
beauty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What a character to give of me to young
ladies!&endq; cried Edgar, doubtful, in his turn, whe|ther
to be hurt or gratified.</P>
<P>&startq;O &s;he did not &s;top at that, Sir,&endq; re&s;umed Ja|cob,
&startq;for &s;he &s;aid, I make no que&s;tion, &s;ays &s;he,
but in half a year he'll lock her up.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana, &s;urprized, gave an involuntary little
&s;hriek: but Edgar, not imputing it to any appro|priate
alarm, was filled with re&s;entment again&s;t Mrs.
Arlbery. What incomprehen&s;ible inju&s;tice! he &s;aid
to him&s;elf: O Camilla! is it po&s;&s;ible any event, any
circum&s;tance upon earth, could induce me to prac|ti&s;e
&s;uch an outrage? to degenerate into &s;uch a
&s;avage?</P>
<P>&startq;Is this all?&endq; a&s;ked Mi&s;s Margland.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="53">
&startq;No, ma'am; but I don't know if Mi&s;s will
like to hear the re&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes,&endq; &s;aid Indiana, &startq;if it's about me, I
don't mind.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, they all &s;aid, Mi&s;s, you'd make the
mo&s;t fine&s;t bride that ever was &s;een, and they did
not wonder at Mr. Mandlebert's chu&s;ing you; but
for all that&mdash;.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topt, and Edgar, who, following the bent
of his own thoughts, had till now concluded Ca|milla
to be meant, was utterly confounded by di&s;|covering
his mi&s;take. The pre&s;ence of Indiana re|doubled
the aukwardne&s;s of the &s;ituation, and her
blu&s;hes, and the increa&s;ed lu&s;tre of her eyes, did
not make the report &s;eem either unwelcome, or per|fectly
new to her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland rai&s;ed her head triumphantly.
This was preci&s;ely &s;uch a circum&s;tance as &s;he flat|tered
her&s;elf would prove deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>The Baronet, equally plea&s;ed, returned her nod
of congratulation, and nodding him&s;elf towards
Edgar, &s;aid; &startq;you're blown, you &s;ee! but what
matters &s;ecrets about nothing? which, Lord help
me, I never knew how to keep.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar was now &s;till more di&s;concerted, and,
from mere di&s;tre&s;s what to &s;ay or do, bid Jacob
go on.</P>
<P>&startq;Why then, they &s;aid a deal more, how pretty
&s;he was, he continued, but they did not know how
it would turn out, for the young lady was &s;o much
admired, that her hu&s;band had need look &s;harp after
her; and if&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What complete impertinence!&endq; cried Edgar,
walking about the room; &startq;I really can li&s;ten no
longer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If he had done wi&s;ely; &s;ays the lady of the
hou&s;e, he would have left the profe&s;&s;ed beauty, and
taken that pretty Camilla.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar &s;urprized, &s;topt &s;hort; this &s;eemed to him
le&s;s impertinent.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="54">
&startq;Camilla is a charming creature, &s;ays &s;he;
though &s;he may want a little watching too; but &s;o
does every thing that is worth having.&endq;</P>
<P>That woman does not want di&s;cernment, thought
Edgar, nor &s;he does not want ta&s;te.&mdash;I can never to|tally
di&s;like her, if &s;he does &s;uch ju&s;tice to Camilla.</P>
<P>He now again invited Jacob to proceed; but In|diana,
with a po$ting lip, walked out of the room,
and Mi&s;s $word$ &s;aid, there was no need to be
hearing him all $$ght.</P>
<P>Jacob, therefore, when no more either inter|rupted
or encouraged, &s;oon fini&s;hed his narrative.
Mrs Arlbery, amu&s;ed by watching Dr. Orkborne,
had in&s;i&s;ted, for an experiment, that Jacob &s;hould
not return to the coach till he was mi&s;&s;ed and called
for; and &s;o inten&s;e was the application of the Doc|tor
to what he was compo&s;ing, that this did not
happen till the whole family had dined; Jacob and
the coachman, at the invitation of Mrs. Arlbery,
having partaken of the &s;ervants fare, equally plea&s;ed
with the regale and the joke. Dr. Orkborne then,
&s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, demanded why the
young ladies were &s;o late, and was much di&s;com|po&s;ed
and a&s;toni&s;hed when he heard they were gone.
Mrs. Arlbery invited him into the hou&s;e, and
offered him refre&s;hments, while &s;he o$dered water
and a feed of corn for the hor&s;es; but he only fret|ted
a little, and then went on again with his
&s;tudies.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now &s;ent &s;ome cold dinner into the
Doctor's room, and declared he &s;hould always ap|prove
his niece's acquaintance with Mrs. Arlbery, as
&s;he was &s;o kind to his &s;ervants and his animals.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Author's Idea of Order.</HEAD>
<P>NOT a bo&s;om of the Cleves party enjoyed much
tranquillity this evening. Mi&s;s Margland, though
<PB N="246" REF="55">
to the Baronet &s;he would not recede from her fir&s;t a&s;|&s;ertions,
&s;trove vainly to palliate to her&s;elf the ill
grace and evident di&s;&s;atisfaction with which Edgar
had met the report. To &s;ave her own credit, how|ever,
was always her primary con&s;ideration; &s;he re|&s;olved,
therefore, to ca&s;t upon unfair play in Ca|milla,
or upon the in&s;tability of Edgar, all the
blame really due to her own undi&s;cerning &s;elf-&s;ufficiency.</P>
<P>Indiana thought &s;o little for her&s;elf, that &s;he
adopted, of cour&s;e, every opinion of Mi&s;s Mar|gland;
yet the immoveable coldne&s;s of Edgar, con|tra&s;ted
frequently in her remembrance by the fervour
of Melmond and of Macder&s;ey, became more and
more di&s;ta&s;teful to $er; and Mrs. Arlbery's idea,
that &s;he &s;hould be locked up in half a year, made her
look upon him alternately as &s;omething to &s;hun or to
over-reach. She even wi&s;hed to refu&s;e him:&mdash;but
Beech Park, the equipage, the &s;ervants, the bridal
habiliment.&mdash;No! &s;he could enjoy tho&s;e, if not
him. And neither her own feelings, nor the le&s;&s;ons
of Mi&s;s Margland, had taught her to look upon
marriage in any nobler point of view.</P>
<P>But the per&s;on mo&s;t deeply di&s;&s;atisfied this evening
was Edgar. He n$w &s;aw that, deceived by his own
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, he had mi&s;under&s;tood Mrs. Needham,
who, as well as Mrs. Arlbery, he was convinced
concluded him engaged to Indiana. He had ob|&s;erved
with concern the approving credulity of Sir
Hugh, and though glad to find his real plan, and
all his wi&s;hes un&s;u&s;pected, the fal&s;e report excited his
fears, le&s;t Indiana &s;hould give it any credit, and &s;e|cretly
hurt his delicacy for the honour of his
ta&s;te.</P>
<P>All the influence of pecuniary motives to which
he deemed Camilla &s;uperior, occurred to him in the
very words of Dr. Marchmont for Indiana; who&s;e
capacity he &s;aw was as &s;hallow as her per&s;on was
beautiful. Yet the admiration with which &s;he had
already made her fir&s;t appearance in the world,
might naturally induce her belief of his reported
<PB N="247" REF="56">
devotion. If, therefore, his &s;ituation appeared to
her to be eligible, &s;he had probably &s;ettled to accept
him.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t timid female delicacy was not more &s;cru|pulous,
than the manly honour of Edgar to avoid
this &s;pecies of mi&s;apprehen&s;ion; and though per|fectly
confident his behaviour had been as irreproach|able
as it was unde&s;igning, the lea&s;t idea of any &s;elf-delu&s;ion
on the part of Indiana, &s;eemed a call upon
his integrity for the mo&s;t unequivocal manife&s;tation of
his intentions. Yet any declaration by words, with
whatever care &s;elected, might be con&s;trued into an
implication that he concluded the deci&s;ion in his
own hands. And though he could &s;carcely doubt
the fact, he ju&s;tly held nothing &s;o offen&s;ive as the
palpable pre&s;umption. One only line of conduct
appeared to him, therefore, unexceptionable; which
was wholly to avoid her, till the rumour &s;unk into
its own nothingne&s;s.</P>
<P>This demanded from him a &s;acrifice the mo&s;t pain|ful,
that of retiring from Cleves in utter ignorance
of the &s;entiments of Camilla; yet it &s;eemed the
more nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince he now, with much unea&s;ine&s;s,
recollected many circum&s;tances which his ab&s;orbed
mind had hitherto &s;uffered to pa&s;s unnoticed, that
led him to fear Sir Hugh him&s;elf, and the whole
party, entertained the &s;ame notion.</P>
<P>He was &s;hocked to con&s;ider Camilla involved in
&s;uch a deception, though delighted by the idea that
he might perhaps owe to an explanation, &s;ome marks
of that preference for which Dr. Marchm$nt had
taught him to wait, and which he now hoped might
lie dormant from the per&s;ua&s;ion of his engagement.
To clear this mi&s;take was, therefore, every way e&s;|&s;ential,
as otherwi&s;e the very purity of her character
mu&s;t be in his disfavour.</P>
<P>Still, however, the vi&s;it to the Grove hung upon
his mind, and he re&s;olved to inve&s;tigate its cau&s;e the
following morning, before he made his retreat.</P>
<P>Early the next day, Camilla &s;ent to ha&s;ten the
chai&s;e which was to fetch Mr. Tyrold, and begged
<PB N="248" REF="57">
leave of her uncle to breakfa&s;t at Etherington. His
a&s;&s;ent was always ready; and believing every evil
would yield to ab&s;ence, &s;he eagerly, and even with
happine&s;s, &s;et off.</P>
<P>When the re&s;t of the party a&s;&s;embled without her,
Edgar, &s;urpri&s;ed, enquired if &s;he were well? Mi&s;s
Margland an&s;wered, yes; but for the &s;ake of what
&s;he loved be&s;t in the world, a frolic, &s;he was gone in
the chai&s;e to Etherington. Edgar could not prevail
with him&s;elf to depart till he had &s;poken with her,
and privately deferred his purpo&s;ed leave-taking till
noon.</P>
<P>During this report, Sir Hugh was anxiou&s;ly en|gaged
in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s he &s;eemed to wi&s;h to conceal.
He &s;poke little, but nodded frequently to him&s;elf,
with an air of approving his own ideas; he &s;um|moned
Jacob to him repeatedly, with whom he held
various whi&s;pering conferences; and de&s;ired Mi&s;s
Margland, who made the tea, not to pour it out
too fa&s;t, as he was in no hurry to have breakfa&s;t
over.</P>
<P>When nothing he could urge &s;ucceeded, in
making any of the company eat or drink any thing
more, he pulled Edgar by the &s;leeve; and, in an
eager but low voice, &s;aid, &startq;My dear Mr. Edgar,
I have a great favour to beg of you, which is only
that you will do &s;omething to divert Dr. Ork|borne.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould be very happy, Sir,&endq; cried Edgar,
&s;miling, &startq;but I much doubt my capability.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, my dear Mr. Edgar, it's only to keep
him from finding out my new &s;urpri&s;e till it's got
ready. And if you will but ju&s;t &s;pout out to him a
bit or two of Virgil and Horace, or &s;ome of tho&s;e
Greek and Latin language-ma&s;ters, he'll be in no
hurry to budge, I promi&s;e you.&endq;</P>
<P>A reque&s;t from Sir Hugh, who with the mo&s;t
prompt alacrity met the wi&s;hes of every one, was
by Edgar held to be indi&s;putable. He advanced,
therefore, to Dr. Orkborne, who was feeling for his
tablets, which he commonly examined in his way up
<PB N="249" REF="58">
the &s;tairs, and &s;tarted a doubt, of which he begged
an expo&s;ition, upon a pa&s;&s;age of Virgil.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne willingly &s;topt, and di&s;played,
with no &s;mall &s;atisfaction, an erudition, that did
him nearly as much honour in the ears of the igno|rant
and admiring Sir Hugh, as in tho&s;e of the culti|vated
and well-judging Edgar. &startq;Ah!&endq; &s;aid the
Baronet, &s;ighing, though addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to no
one, &startq;if I had but addicted my&s;elf to the&s;e &s;tudies
in due &s;ea&s;on, I might have under&s;tood all this too!
though now I can't for my life make out much &s;en&s;e
of what they're talking of; nor a little neither, in|deed,
as to that; thanks to my own idlene&s;s; to
which, however, I am not much obliged.&endq;</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;oon led to &s;ome
points of compari&s;on, that demanded a review of
various authors, and the Doctor propo&s;ed adjourning
to his own apartment. The Baronet winked at Ed|gar,
who would have changed the di&s;cour&s;e, or him|&s;elf
have &s;ought the books, or have been &s;atisfied
without them; but Dr. Orkborne was as eager here,
as in other matters he was &s;low and phlegmatic;
and, regardle&s;s of all oppo&s;ition, was making off,
when Sir Hugh, catching him by the arm, ex|claimed,
&startq;My good friend, I beg it as a particular
favour, you won't &s;tir a &s;tep!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not &s;tir a &s;tep, Sir?&endq; repeated the Doctor,
amazed.</P>
<P>&startq;That is, not to your own room.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not go to my own room, Sir?&endq;</P>
<P>The Baronet gently begged him not to take it
ami&s;s, and pre&s;ently, upon the appearance of Jacob,
who entered with a &s;ignificant &s;mile, &s;aid, he would
keep him no longer.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, to whom nothing was &s;o irk&s;ome
as a moment's detention from his books and papers,
in&s;tantly departed, inviting Edgar to accompany
him; but without troubling him&s;elf to inquire for
what end he had been held back.</P>
<P>When they were gone, Sir Hugh, rubbing his
hands, &s;aid, &startq;Well, I think this good gentleman
<PB N="250" REF="59">
won't go about the country again, with all his books
fa&s;tened about him, to &s;hew he has no where to put
them: for as to his telling me he only took them to
look at, I am not quite &s;uch an ignoramus, with all
my ignorance, as to believe &s;uch a thing as that, e&s;|pecially
of a regular bred &s;cholar.&endq;</P>
<P>A loud and angry &s;ound of voices from above here
interrupted the plea&s;ed harangue of the Baronet;
Mi&s;s Margland opened the door to li&s;ten, and, with
no &s;mall delight, heard words, &s;carce intelligible for
rage, breaking from Dr. Orkborne, who&s;e anger,
while Edgar was endeavouring to moderate, Jacob
and Mary were vociferou&s;ly re&s;enting.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, all a&s;toni&s;hed, feared there was &s;ome
mi&s;take. He had &s;ent, the preceding day, as far as
Winche&s;ter, for two book-ca&s;es, which he had or|dered
&s;hould arrive early, and be put up during the
breakfa&s;t; and he had directed Mary to place upon
the &s;helves, with great care, all the loo&s;e books and
papers &s;he found di&s;per&s;ed about the room, as neatly
as po&s;&s;ible: after which Jacob was to give notice
when all was arranged.</P>
<P>The words now &startq;If I mu&s;t have my manu&s;cripts
rummaged at plea&s;ure, by every dunce in the hou&s;e,
I would rather lie in the &s;treet!&endq; di&s;tinctly caught
their ears. Sir Hugh was thunder&s;truck with amaze|ment
and di&s;appointment, but &s;aid nothing. Mi&s;s
Margland looked all &s;pight and plea&s;ure, and Eu|genia
all concern.</P>
<P>Louder yet, and with accents of encrea&s;ing a&s;|perity,
the Doctor next exclaimed &startq;A twelvemonth's
hard labour will not repair this mi&s;chief! I &s;hould
have been much more obliged to you if you had
blown out my brains!&endq;</P>
<P>The Baronet, agha&s;t, cried, &startq;Lord help us! I
think I had be&s;t go and get the &s;helves pulled down
again, what I have done not being meant to offend,
being what will co&s;t me ten pounds and upwards.&endq;</P>
<P>He then, though &s;omewhat irre&s;olute, whether or
not to proceed, moved towards the foot of the &s;tairs;
but there a new &s;torm of rage &s;tartled him. &startq;I wi&s;h
you had been all of you annihilated ere ever you had
<PB N="251" REF="60">
entered my room! I had rather have lo&s;t my ears
than that manu&s;cript! I wi&s;h with all my heart you
had been at the bottom of the &s;ea, every one of you,
before you had touched it!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you won't believe me, it can't be helped,&endq;
&s;aid Mary; &startq;but if I was to tell it you over and
over, I've done nothing to no mortal thing. I only
ju&s;t &s;wept the room after the carpenter was gone, for
it was all in &s;uch a pickle it was a &s;hame to be &s;een.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have ruined me!&endq; cried he, &startq;you have
&s;wept it behind the fire, I make not a moment's
doubt; and I had rather you had given me a bowl of
poi&s;on! you can make me no reparation; it was a
clue to a whole &s;ection.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, I won't make no more words about it,&endq;
&s;aid Mary, angrily; &startq;but I'm &s;ure I never &s;o much
as touched it with a pair of tongs, for I never &s;ee it;
nor I don't &s;o much as know it if I do.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, it's a piece of paper written all over;
look! ju&s;t &s;uch another as this: I left it on the table,
by this corner&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! that?&endq; cried Mary; &startq;yes, I remember
that.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, where is it? What have you done with
it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, I happened of a little accident about
that;&mdash;for as I was a &s;weeping under the table, the
broom knocked the ink down; but, by good luck, it
only fell upon that little mor&s;el of paper.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Little mor&s;el of paper? it's more precious than
a whole library! But what did you do with it? what
is become of it? whatever condition it is in, if you
have but &s;aved it&mdash;where is it, I &s;ay?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why&mdash;it was all over ink, and good for nothing,
&s;o I did not think of your mi&s;&s;ing it&mdash;&s;o I throwed
it behind the fire.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I wi&s;h you had been thrown there your&s;elf with
all my heart! But if ever you bring a broom into
my room again&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, I did nothing but what my ma&s;ter or|dered&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="61">
&startq;Or if you ever you touch a paper, or a book of
mine, again&mdash;&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;Your ma&s;ter's a blockhead! and you are an|other

<P>Mary now hurried out of the room, enraged for
her ma&s;ter, and frightened for her&s;elf; and Edgar,
not aware Sir Hugh was within hearing, &s;oon &s;uc|ceeded
in calming the Doctor, by mildly li&s;tening
to his lamentations.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, extremely &s;hocked, &s;at upon the &s;tairs
to recover him&s;elf. Mi&s;s Margland, who never felt
&s;o virtuous, and never &s;o elated, as when witne&s;&s;ing
the imperfections or improprieties of others, de&s;|ca$ted
largely again&s;t ingratitude; treating an un|meaning
&s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion as a &s;erious mark of tur|pitude:
but Eugenia, a&s;hamed for Dr. Orkborne,
to whom, as her preceptor, &s;he felt a con&s;tant di&s;|po&s;ition
to be partial, determined to endeavour to
induce him to make &s;ome apology. She glided,
therefore, pa$$ her uncle, and tapped at the Doctor's
door.</P>
<P>Mary &s;eeing her ma&s;ter &s;o invitingly in her way,
could by no means re&s;i&s;t her de&s;ire of appeal and
complaint; and, de&s;cending the &s;tairs, begged his
honour to hear her.</P>
<P>&startq;Mary,&endq; &s;aid he, ri&s;ing, and returning to the
parlour, &startq;you need not tell me a word, for I have
heard it all my&s;elf; by which it may be truly &s;aid,
li&s;teners never hear good of them&s;elves; &s;o I've got
the proper puni&s;hment; for which rea&s;on, I hope
you won't look upon it as an example.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;ure, Sir,&endq; &s;aid Mary, &startq;if your honour
can excu&s;e his &s;peaking &s;o di&s;re&s;pectful, it's what no|body
el&s;e can; and if it was not for thinking as his
head's got a crack in it, there is not a &s;ervant among
us as would not affront him for it.&endq;</P>
<P>The Baronet interrupted her with a &s;erious lecture
upon the civility he expected for all his gue&s;ts; and
&s;he promi&s;ed to re&s;train her wrath; &startq;But only, Sir,&endq;
&s;he continued, &startq;if your honour had &s;een the bit of
<PB N="253" REF="62">
paper as he made &s;uch a noi&s;e at me for, your honour
would not have believed it. Not a &s;oul could have
read it. My Tom would ha' been well licked if he'd
wrote no better at &s;chool. And as to his being a
twelvemonth a &s;crawling &s;uch another, I'll no more
believe it than I'll fly. It's as great a $ib as ever was
told.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh begged her to be quiet, and to think no
more of the matter.</P>
<P>&startq;No, your honour, I hope I'm not a per&s;on as
bears malice; only I could not but &s;peak of it, be|cau&s;e
he behaves more comical every day. I thought
he'd ha' beat me over and over. And as to the
&s;tories he tells about them little bits of paper, mortal
patience can't bear it no longer.&endq;</P>
<P>The remon&s;trance of Eugenia took immediate ef|fect.
Dr. Orkborne, &s;hocked and alarmed at the
expre&s;&s;ion which had e&s;caped him, prote&s;ted him&s;elf
willing to make the humble&s;t reparation, and truly
declared, he had been &s;o greatly di&s;turbed by the lo&s;s
he had ju&s;t &s;u&s;tained, that he not merely did not
mean, but did not know what he had &s;aid.</P>
<P>Edgar was the bearer of this apology, which Sir
Hugh accepted with his u&s;ual good humour. &startq;His
calling me a blockhead,&endq; cried he, &startq;is a thing I
have no right to re&s;ent, becau&s;e I take it for granted,
he would not have &s;aid it, if he had not thought it;
and a man's thoughts are his ca&s;tle, and ought to be
free.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar repeated the prote&s;tation, that he had been
hurried on by pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;poke without meaning.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then, my dear Mr. Edgar, I mu&s;t fairly
own I don't &s;ee the great &s;uperiorne&s;s of learning, if
it can't keep a man's temper out of a pa&s;&s;ion. How|ever,
&s;ay nothing of the &s;ort to poor Clermont, upon
his coming over, who I expect won't &s;peak one word
in ten I &s;hall under&s;tand; which, however, as it's all
been done for the be&s;t, I would not have the poor boy
di&s;couraged in.&endq;</P>
<P>He then &s;ent a kind me&s;&s;age by Edgar to Dr. Ork|borne,
de&s;i$ing him not to mind &s;uch a trifle.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="63">
This conciliating office was congenial to the di&s;|po&s;ition
of Edgar, and &s;oftened his impatience for
the return of Camilla, but when, &s;oon after, a note
arrived from Mr. Tyrold, reque&s;ting Sir Hugh to
di&s;pen&s;e with &s;eeing him till the next day, and apo|logi&s;ing
for keeping his daughter, he felt equally di&s;|appointed
and provoked, though he determined not
to delay any longer his departure. He gave orders,
therefore, for his hor&s;es immediately, and with all
the le&s;s $$gret, for knowing Camilla no longer in the
circle he was to quit.</P>
<P>The ladies were in the parlour with Sir Hugh,
who was &s;orrowfully brooding over his brother's note,
when he entered it to take leave. Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf
&s;omewhat rapidly to the Baronet, he told him he
was under an unplea&s;ant nece&s;&s;ity, to relinqui&s;h &s;ome
days of the month's &s;ojourn intended for him. He
made acknowledgments full of regard for his kind|ne&s;s
and ho&s;pitality? and then, only bowing to the
ladies, left the room, before the a&s;toni&s;hed Sir Hugh
comprehended he was going.</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; Cried Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;this is curious
indeed! $e has flown off from every thing, without
even $word$ apology!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I hope he is not really gone?&endq; &s;aid Eugenia,
walking to the window.</P>
<P>&startq;I'm &s;ure I don't care what he does,&endq; cried In|diana,
&startq;he's welcome to go or to &s;tay. I'm grown
quite &s;ick of him, for my part.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Gone?&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh, recovering breath;
&startq;it's impo&s;&s;ible! Why, he never has &s;aid one word
to me of the day, nor the &s;ettlements, nor all tho&s;e
things!&endq;</P>
<P>He then rang the bell, and &s;ent to de&s;ire Mr. Man|dlebert
might be called immediately.</P>
<P>Edgar, who was mounting his hor&s;e, obeyed with
&s;ome chagrin. As &s;oon as he re-entered the room,
Sir Hugh cried; &startq;My dear Mr. young Edgar, it's
&s;omething amazing to me you &s;hould think of going
away without coming to an explanation?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;An explanation, Sir?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="64">
&startq;Yes, don't you know what I mean?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not in the lea&s;t, Sir,&endq; cried Edgar, &s;taggered
by a doubt whether he &s;u&s;pected what he felt for Ca|milla,
or referred to what was reported of Indiana.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then, my pretty dear,&endq; &s;aid Sir Hugh
to Indiana, &startq;you won't object, I hope, to taking
a little walk in the garden, provided it is not di&s;|agreeable
to you; for you had better not hear what
we are going to talk about before your face.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana, pouting her beautiful under lip, and
&s;cornfully pa&s;&s;ing Edgar, complied. Eugenia ac|companied
her; but Mi&s;s Margland kept her ground.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, always unwilling to make any attack,
and at a lo&s;s how to begin, &s;imply &s;aid; &startq;Why, I
thought Mr. Mandlebert, you would &s;tay with us
till next year?&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar only bowed.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then, &s;uppo&s;e you do?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mo&s;t probably, Sir, I &s;hall by that time be upon
the Continent. If &s;ome particular circum&s;tance does
not occur, I purpo&s;e &s;hortly making the tour of
Europe.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now lo&s;t all guard and all re&s;traint, and with
undi&s;gui&s;ed di&s;plea&s;ure exclaimed; &startq;So here's ju&s;t
the &s;econd part of Clermont! at the moment I &s;ent
for him home, thinking he would come to put the
fini&s;h to all my cares about Eugenia, he &s;$nds me
word he mu&s;t travel!&mdash;And though the poor girl
took it very well, from knowing nothing of the mat|ter,
I can't &s;ay I take it very kind of you, Mr.
young Edgar, to come and do ju&s;t the &s;ame by In|diana!&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;urprize of Edgar was un&s;peakable: that Sir
Hugh &s;hould wi&s;h the relation of Jacob, with re&s;pect
to Indiana, confirmed, he could not wonder; but
that his wi&s;hes &s;hould have amounted to expectations,
and that he &s;hould deem his niece ill u&s;ed by their
failure, gave him the mo&s;t poignant a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, taking advantage of his &s;ilent
con&s;ternation, began now to pour forth very vo|lubly&punc;
the mo&s;t pointed reflections upon the injury
<PB N="256" REF="65">
done to young ladies by reports of this nature, which
were always &s;ure to keep off all other offers. There
was no end, &s;he &s;aid, to the admirers who had de|&s;erted
Indiana in de&s;pair; and &s;he que&s;tioned if &s;he
would ever have any more, from the general belief
of her being actually pre-engaged.</P>
<P>Edgar, who&s;e &s;en&s;e of honour was tenaciou&s;ly de|licate,
heard her with a mixture of concern for In|diana,
and indignation again&s;t her&s;elf, that kept her
long uninterrupted; for though burning to a&s;&s;ert the
integrity of his conduct, the fear of uttering a word
that might be offen&s;ive to Indiana, embarra&s;&s;ed and
checked him.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who in &s;eeing him overpowered, con|cluded
he was relenting, now kindly took his hand,
and &s;aid: &startq;My dear Mr. Mandlebert, if you are
&s;orry for what you were intending, of going away,
and leaving us all in the lurch, why, you &s;hall never
hear a word more about it, for I will make friends
for you with Indiana, and beg of Mi&s;s Margland that
&s;he'll do us the favour to &s;ay no more.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, affectionately pre&s;&s;ing the hand of the
Baronet, uttered the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of per&s;onal
regard, and prote&s;ted he &s;hould always think it an
honour to have been held worthy of pretending to
any alliance in his family; but he kuew not how the
pre&s;ent mi&s;take had been made, or report had ari&s;en:
he could boa&s;t of no partiality from Mi&s;s Lynmere,
nor had he ever addre&s;&s;ed her with any particular
views: yet, as it was the opinion of Mi&s;s Margland,
that the rumour, however fal&s;e, might prevent the
approach of &s;ome de&s;erving object, he now finally
determined to become, for a while, a &s;tranger at
Cleves, however painful &s;uch &s;elf-denial mu&s;t prove.</P>
<P>He then precipitately left the room, and, in five
minutes, had galloped out of the Park.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the morning was &s;pent by Sir Hugh
in the utmo&s;t di&s;compo&s;ure; and by Mi&s;s Margland
in alternate abu&s;e of Camilla and of Edgar; while
Indiana pa&s;&s;ed from a piqued and &s;hort di&s;appoint|ment,
<PB N="257" REF="66">
to the con&s;olatory idea that Melmond might
now re-appear.</P>
<P>Edgar rode &s;trait to Beech Park, where he bu&s;ied
him&s;elf the whole day in viewing alterations and im|provements;
but where nothing an&s;wered his ex|pectations,
&s;ince Camilla had di&s;appointed them.
That &s;un-beam, which had gilded the place to his
eyes, was now overclouded, and the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his own domain, was his fir&s;t day of di&s;content.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="29" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Maternal Eye.</HEAD>
<P>THE vivacity with which Camilla quitted Cleves,
was &s;unk before &s;he reached Etherington. She had
quitted al&s;o Edgar, quitted him offended, and in
doubt if it might ever be right &s;he &s;hould vindicate
her&s;elf in his opinion. Yet all &s;eemed &s;trange and
unintelligible that regarded the a&s;&s;erted nuptials: his
indifference was palpable; &s;he believed him to have
been unaccountably drawn in, and her heart &s;oftly
whi&s;pered, it was her&s;elf he preferred.</P>
<P>From this &s;oothing but dangerous idea, &s;he
&s;truggled to turn her thoughts. She anticipated the
remor&s;e of holding the affections of the hu&s;band of
her cou&s;in, and determined to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible me|thod
to forget him&mdash;unle&s;s, which &s;he &s;trove vainly
not to hope, the reported alliance &s;hould never take
place.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections &s;o completely engro&s;&s;ed her the
whole way, that &s;he arrived at the Par&s;onage Hou&s;e,
without the &s;malle&s;t mental preparation how to ac|count
for her return, or how to plead for remaining
at Etherington. Fore&s;ight, the offspring of judg|ment,
or the di&s;ciple of Experience, made no part
of the character of Camilla, who&s;e impetuous di&s;|po&s;ition
was open to every danger of indi&s;cretion,
<PB N="258" REF="67">
though her genuine love of virtue glowed warm with
juvenile ardour.</P>
<P>She entered, therefore, the breakfa&s;t parlour in a
&s;tate of &s;udden perplexity what to &s;ay; Mr. Tyrold
was alone and writing. He looked &s;urprized, but
embraced her with his accu&s;tomed affection, and en|quired
to what he owed her pre&s;ent &s;ight.</P>
<P>She made no an&s;wer; but embraced him again,
and enquired after her mother.</P>
<P>&startq;She is well,&endq; he replied: &startq;but, tell me, is
your uncle impatient of my delay? It has been wholly
unavoidable. I have been deeply engaged; and
deeply chagrined. Your poor mother would be &s;till
more di&s;turbed, if the noblene&s;s of her mind did not
&s;upport her.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, extremely grieved, earne&s;tly enquired
what had happened.</P>
<P>He then informed her that Mrs. Tyrold, the very
next morning, mu&s;t abruptly quit them all and &s;et
out for Li&s;bon to her &s;ick brother, Mr. Relvil.</P>
<P>&startq;Is he &s;o much wor&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No: I even hope he is better. An act of folly
has brought this to bear. Do not now de&s;ire par|ticulars.
I will fini&s;h my letter, and then return
with you for a few minutes to Cleves. The carriage
mu&s;t wait.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Suffer me fir&s;t to a&s;k, does Lavinia go with my
mother?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, &s;he can only take old Ambro&s;e. Lavinia
mu&s;t &s;upply her place at home.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! my deare&s;t father, and may not I, too,
&s;tay with you and a&s;&s;i&s;t her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If my brother will &s;pare you, my dear child,
there is nothing can &s;o much contribute to wile away
to me your mother's ab&s;ence.&endq;</P>
<P>Enchanted thus, without an$ explanation, to have
gained her point, &s;he completely revived; though
when Mrs. Tyrold, whom &s;he almo&s;t wor&s;hipped, en|tered
the room, in all the hurry of preparing for her
long journey, &s;he &s;hed a torrent of tears in her arms.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="68">
&startq;This good girl,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold, &startq;is her&s;elf
de&s;irous to quit the pre&s;ent gaities of Cleves, to try
to enliven my &s;olitude till we all may meet again.&endq;</P>
<P>The con&s;cious and artle&s;s Camilla could not bear
this unde&s;erved prai&s;e. She quitted her mother, and
returning to Mr. Tyrold, &startq;O my father!&endq; &s;he
cried, &startq;if you will take me again under your beloved
roof, it is for my &s;ake&mdash;not your's&mdash;I beg to re|turn!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She is right,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold; &startq;there is no

be with you were not her fir&s;t gratification.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, indeed, my dear mother, it would always
be &s;o, even if no other inducement&mdash;.&endq; She &s;topt
&s;hort, confu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, who continued writing, did not heed
this little blunder; but his wife, who&s;e quickne&s;s of
apprehen&s;ion and depth of ob&s;ervation, were always
alive, even in the mid&s;t of bu&s;ine&s;s, cares, and other
attentions, turned ha&s;tily to her daughter, and a&s;ked
to what &startq;other inducement&endq; &s;he alluded.</P>
<P>Camilla, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, hung her head, and would
have forborne making any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold, then, putting down various packet$
which &s;he was &s;orting and &s;electing, came &s;uddenly
up to her, and taking both her hands, looked ear|ne&s;tly
in her face, &s;aying: &startq;My Camilla! &s;omething
has di&s;quieted you?&mdash;your countenance is not it&s;elf.
Tell me, my dear girl, what brought you hither this
morning? and what is it you mean by &s;ome other
inducement?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do not a&s;k me now, my deare&s;t mother,&endq; an|&s;wered
&s;he, in a faultering voice; &startq;when you come
back again, no doubt all will be over; and then&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And is that the time, Camilla, to &s;peak to your
be&s;t friends? would it not be more judicious to be
explicit with them, while what affects you is &s;till de|pending?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, hiding her face on her mother's bo&s;om,
bur&s;t afre&s;h into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="69">
&startq;Alas!&endq; cried Mrs. Tyrold, &startq;what new evil is
hovering? If it mu&s;t invade me again through one

wilfully that you, too, afflict me? and afflict the
be&s;t of fathers?&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, dropping his pen, looked at them
both with the mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive anxiety.</P>
<P>&startq;No, my deare&s;t mother,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, endea|vouring
to meet her eyes; &startq;not wilfully,&mdash;but &s;ome|thing
has happened&mdash;I can hardly my&s;elf tell how or
what&mdash;but indeed Cleves, now&mdash;&endq; &s;he he&s;itated.</P>
<P>&startq;How is my brother?&endq; demanded Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>&startq;O! all that is good and kind! and I grieve to
quit him&mdash;but, indeed, Cleves, now&mdash;&endq; Again &s;he
he&s;itated.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my dear child!&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold, &startq;I
always feared that re&s;idence!&mdash;you are too young,
too incon&s;iderate, too innocent, indeed, to be left &s;o
utterly to your&s;elf.&mdash;Forgive me, my dear Mr. Ty|rold;
I do not mean to reflect upon your brother,
but he is not <HI>you!</HI>&mdash;and with you alone, this dear
inexperienced girl can be &s;ecure from all harm. Tell
me, however, what it is&mdash;?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, in the extreme&s;t confu&s;ion changed co|lour,
but tried vainly to &s;peak. Mr. Tyrold, &s;u&s;|pended
from all employment, waited fearfully &s;ome
explanation.</P>
<P>&startq;We have no time,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold, &startq;for de|lay;&mdash;
you know I am going abroad,&mdash;and cannot
a&s;certain my return; though all my heart left be|hind
me, with my children and their father, will urge
every acceleration in my power.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla wept again, fondly folding her arms round
her mother; &startq;I had hoped,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;that I
&s;hould have come home to peace, comfort, tran|quillity!
to both of you, my deare&s;t father and mo|ther,
and to all my unbroken happine&s;s under your

<P>&startq;Con&s;ole your&s;elf, my Camilla, that you have
not been its cau&s;e; may Heaven ever &s;pare me evil

in your &s;hape at lea&s;t!&mdash;you &s;ay it is nothing wilful?
I can bear every thing el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We will not,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold, &startq;pre&s;s her;
&s;he will tell us all in her own way, and at her own
time. Forced confidence is neither fair nor flatter|ing.
I will excu&s;e her return to my brother, and
&s;he will the &s;ooner be able to give her account for
finding her&s;elf not hurried.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Calm your&s;elf, then,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold, &startq;as
your indulgent father permits, and I will proceed
with my preparations.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now, &s;omewhat recovering, declared &s;he
had almo&s;t nothing to &s;ay; but her mother conti|nued
packing up, and her father went on with his
letter.</P>
<P>She had now time to con&s;ider that her own fears
and emotion were involving her in unnece&s;&s;ary con|fe&s;&s;ions;
&s;he re&s;olved, therefore, to repre&s;s the ful|ne&s;s
of her heart, and to acknowledge only the ac|cu&s;ation
of Mi&s;s Margland. And in a few minutes,
without waiting for further enquiry, &s;he gathered
courage to open upon the &s;ubject; and with as much
ea&s;e and quietne&s;s as &s;he could command, related, in
general terms, the charge brought again&s;t her, and
her con&s;equent de&s;ire to quit Cleves, &startq;till,&mdash;till
&mdash;&endq; Here &s;he &s;topt for breath. Mr. Tyrold in|&s;tantly
fini&s;hed the &s;entence, &startq;till the marriage has
taken place?&endq;</P>
<P>She coloured, and faintly uttered, &startq;Yes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are right, my child,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;and you
have acted with a prudence which does you honour.
Neither the able&s;t rea&s;oning, nor the mo&s;t upright
conduct, can &s;o completely obliterate a &s;urmi&s;e of
this nature, from a &s;u&s;picious mind, as ab&s;ence.
You &s;hall remain, therefore, with me, till your
cou&s;in is &s;ettled in her new habitation. Do you
know if the day is fixed?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Sir,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, while the ro&s;es fled
her cheeks at a que&s;tion which implied &s;o firm a be|lief
of the union.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="71">
&startq;Do not &s;uffer this affair to occa&s;ion you any
further unea&s;ine&s;s,&endq; he continued; &startq;it is the in|herent
and unalienable compact of Innocence with
Truth, to hold them&s;elves immovably &s;uperior to the
calumny of fal&s;e imputations. But I will go my&s;elf
to Cleves, and &s;et this whole matter right.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And will you, too, Sir, have the goodne&s;s&mdash;&endq;
She was going to &s;ay, <HI>to make my peace with Edgar;</HI>
but the fear of mi&s;interpretation checked her, and
&s;he turned away.</P>
<P>He gently enquired what &s;he meant; &s;he avoided
any explanation, and he re&s;umed his writing.</P>
<P>Ah me! thought &s;he, will the time ever come,
when with openne&s;s, with propriety, I may clear
my&s;elf of caprice to Edgar?</P>
<P>Le&s;s patient, becau&s;e more alarmed than her hu&s;|band,
Mrs. Tyrold followed her to the window.
She &s;aw a tear in her eye, and again &s;he took both
her hands: &startq;Have you, my Camilla,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;have you told us all? Can unju&s;t impertinence &s;o
greatly have di&s;turbed you? Is there no &s;ting be|longing
to this wound that you are covering from
our &s;ight, though it may preci&s;ely be the &s;pot that
calls mo&s;t for &s;ome healing balm?&endq;</P>
<P>Again the cheeks of Camilla received their fugi|tive
ro&s;es. &startq;My deare&s;t mother,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;is
not this enough?&mdash;to be accu&s;ed&mdash;&s;u&s;pected&mdash;and to
fear&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;tammered, and would have withdrawn her
hands; but Mrs. Tyrold, &s;till holding them, &s;aid,
&startq;To fear what? &s;peak out, my be&s;t child! open
to us your whole heart!&mdash;Where el&s;e will you find
repo&s;itories &s;o tender?&endq;</P>
<P>Tears again flowed down the burning cheeks of
Camilla, and dropping her eyes, &startq;Ah, my mo|ther!&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;you will think me &s;o frivolous&mdash;
you will blu&s;h &s;o for your daughter&mdash;if I own&mdash;if I
dare confe&s;s&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Again &s;he &s;topped, terrified at the conjectures to
which this opening might give birth; but when fur|ther
and fondly pre&s;&s;ed by her mother, &s;he added,
<PB N="263" REF="72">
&startq;It is not alone the&s;e unju&s;t &s;urmi&s;es,&mdash;nor even
Indiana's unkind concurrence in them&mdash;but al&s;o&mdash;I
have been afraid&mdash;I mu&s;t have made a &s;trange&mdash;a
capricious&mdash;an ungrateful appearance in the eyes of
Edgar Mandlebert.&endq;</P>
<P>Here her voice dropt; but pre&s;ently recovering,
&s;he rapidly continued, &startq;I know it is very immate|rial&mdash;
and I am &s;en&s;ible how fooli&s;h it may &s;ound&mdash;
but I &s;hall al&s;o think of it no more now,&mdash;and
therefore, as I have told the whole&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>She looked up, con&s;cience &s;truck at the&s;e la&s;t
words, to &s;ee if they proved &s;atisfactory: &s;he
caught, in the countenance of her mother, an ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of deep commi&s;eration, which was followed
by a thou&s;and maternal care&s;&s;es of unu&s;ual &s;oftne&s;s,
though unaccompanied by any words.</P>
<P>Penetrated, yet di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, &s;he gratefully received
them, but rejoiced when, at length, Mr. Tyrold,
ri&s;ing, &s;aid, &startq;Go, my love, up &s;tairs to your &s;i&s;ter;
your mother, el&s;e, will never proceed with her
bu&s;ine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>She gladly ran off, and &s;oon, by a conci&s;e narra|tion,
&s;atisfied Lavinia, and then calmed her own
troubled mind.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now, though evidently much affected
him&s;elf, &s;trove to compo&s;e his wife. &startq;Alas!&endq; cried
&s;he, &startq;do you not &s;ee what thus has touched me?
Do you not perceive that our lovely girl, more ju&s;t
to his worth than its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, has given her whole
heart to Edgar Mandlebert?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I perceived it through your emotion, but I had
not di&s;covered it my&s;elf. I grieve, now, that the
probability of &s;uch an event had not &s;truck me in
time to have kept them apart for its prevention.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I grieve for nothing,&endq; cried &s;he, warmly,
&startq;but the infatuated blindne&s;s of that &s;elf-lo&s;t young
man. What a wife would Camilla have made him in
every &s;tage of their united career! And how unfor|tunately
has &s;he &s;ympathi&s;ed in my &s;entiments, that
he alone &s;eemed worthy to replace the fir&s;t and be&s;t
protector &s;he mu&s;t relinqui&s;h when &s;he quits this
<PB N="264" REF="73">
hou&s;e! What will he find in Indiana but a beautiful
doll, unintere&s;ted in his feelings, unmoved by his ex|cellencies,
and incapable of comprehending him if
he &s;peaks either of bu&s;ine&s;s or literature!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yet many wives of this de&s;cription,&endq; replied
Mr. Tyrold, &startq;are more plea&s;ing in the eyes of their
hu&s;bands than women who are either better informed
in intellect, or more alive in &s;en&s;ation; and it is not
an uncommon idea among&s;t men, that where, both
in temper and affairs, there is lea&s;t participation,
there is mo&s;t repo&s;e. But this is not the ca&s;e with
Edgar.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No! he has a nobler re&s;emblance than this por|trait
would allow him; a re&s;emblance which made
me hope from him a far higher &s;tyle of choice. He
prepares him&s;elf, however, his own ample puni&s;h|ment;
for he has too much under&s;tanding not to
&s;icken of mere per&s;onal allurements, and too much
genero&s;ity to be flattered, or &s;atisfied, by mere pa&s;|&s;ive
intellectual inferiority. Neither a mi&s;tre&s;s nor a
&s;lave can make him happy; a companion is what he
requires; and for that, in a very few months, how
vainly his &s;ecret &s;oul may &s;igh, and <HI>think of our
Camilla!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>They then &s;ettled, that it would be now e&s;&s;ential
to the peace of their child to keep her as much as
po&s;&s;ible from his &s;ight; and determined not to &s;end
her back to Cleves to apologize for the new plan,
but to take upon them&s;elves that whole charge.
&startq;Her nature,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold, &startq;is &s;o gay, &s;o
prompt for happine&s;s, that I have little fear but in
ab&s;ence &s;he will &s;oon cea&s;e to dwell upon him. Fear,
indeed, I have, but it is of a deeper evil than this
early impre&s;&s;ion; I fear for her future lot! With
whom can we tru&s;t her?&mdash;She will not endure negli|gence;
and tho&s;e &s;he cannot re&s;pect &s;he will &s;oon
de&s;pi&s;e. What a pro$pect for her, then, with our
pre&s;ent race of young men! their frivolous ficklene&s;s
nau&s;eates whatever they can reach; they have a weak
&s;hame of a&s;&s;erting, or even li&s;tening to what is right,
and a &s;hallow pride in profe&s;&s;ing and performing
<PB N="265" REF="74">
what is wrong. How mu&s;t this ingenuous girl for|get
all &s;he has yet &s;een, heard, or felt, ere &s;he can
encounter wickedne&s;s, or even weakne&s;s, and di&s;|gui&s;e
her abhorrence or contempt?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Georgiana, let us never look forward
to evil.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Will it not be doubly hard to bear, if it come
upon us without preparation?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I think not. Terror &s;hakes, and apprehen&s;ion
depre&s;&s;es: hope nerves as well as gladdens us. Re|member
always, I do not by hope mean pre&s;ump|tion;
I mean &s;imply a chearful tru&s;t in heaven.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t always yield,&endq; cried Mrs. Tyrold, &startq;to
your &s;uperior wi&s;dom, and reflecting piety; and if I
cannot conquer my fears, at lea&s;t I will neither
court nor indulge them.&endq;</P>
<P>The thanks of a grateful hu&s;band repaid this
compliance. They &s;ent for Camilla, to acquaint her
they would make her excu&s;es at Cleves: &s;he gave a
ready though melancholy con&s;ent, and the virtue of
her motives drew tears from her idolizing mother, as
&s;he cla&s;ped her to her heart.</P>
<P>They then &s;et out together, that Mr. Tyrold
might arrange this bu&s;ine&s;s with Sir Hugh, of whom
and of Eugenia Mrs. Tyrold was to take leave.</P>

<P>CAMILLA now felt more permanently revived,
becau&s;e better &s;atisfied with the rectitude of her
conduct. She could no longer be accu&s;ed of inter|fering
between Edgar and Indiana; that affair
would take its natural cour&s;e, and, be it what it
might, while ab&s;ent from both parties, &s;he concluded
&s;he &s;hould at lea&s;t e&s;cape all cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Peaceably, therefore, &s;he returned to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of her u&s;ual apartment, affectionately accom|panied
by her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="75">
The form and the mind of Lavinia were in the
mo&s;t perfect harmony. Her poli&s;hed complexion
was fair, clear, and tran&s;parent; her features were
of the extreme&s;t delicacy, her eyes of the &s;ofte&s;t
blue, and her &s;mile di&s;played internal &s;erenity. The
unru&s;&s;led &s;weetne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition bore the &s;ame
character of mode&s;t excellence. Joy, hope, and
pro&s;perity, &s;ickne&s;s, &s;orrow, and di&s;appointment,
a&s;&s;ailed alike in vain the uniform gentlene&s;s of her
temper: yet though thus exempt from all natural
turbulence, either of plea&s;ure or of pain, the meek|ne&s;s
of her compo&s;ition degenerated not into in&s;en|&s;ibility;
it was open to all the feminine feelings of
pity, of &s;ympathy, and of tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus copiou&s;ly gifted with &startq;all her &s;ex's &s;oft|ne&s;s,&endq;
her &s;ociety would have contributed to re&s;tore
Camilla to repo&s;e, had they continued together
without interruption; but, in a few minutes, the
room door was opened, and Lionel, ru&s;hing into the
apartment, called out, &startq;How do, do, my girls?
how do, do?&endq; and &s;hook them each by the hand,
with a &s;wing that nearly brought them to the
ground.</P>
<P>Camilla always rejoiced at his &s;ight; but La|vinia
gravely &s;aid, &startq;I thought, brother, you had
been at Dr. Marchmont's?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All in good time, my dear! I &s;hall certainly
vi&s;it the old gentleman before long.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Did you not &s;leep there, then, la&s;t night?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, child.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Good God, Lionel!&mdash;if my mother&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear little Lavinia,&endq; cried he, chucking
her under the chin, &startq;I have a va&s;t notion of making
vi&s;its at my own time, in&s;tead of my mamma's.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O Lionel! and can you, ju&s;t now&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come, come,&endq; interrupted he, &startq;don't let us
wa&s;te our precious minutes in old moralizing. If I
had not luckily been hard by, I &s;hould not have
known the coa&s;t was clear. Pray where are they
gone, tantivying?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To Cleves.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="76">
&startq;To Cleves! what a happy e&s;cape! I was upon
the point of going thither my&s;elf. Camilla, what
is the matter with thee?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing&mdash;I am only thinking&mdash;pray when do
you go to Oxford?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pho, pho,&mdash;what do you talk of Oxford for?
you are grown quite &s;tupid, girl. I believe you
have lived too long with Mi&s;s Margland. Pray how
does that dear creature do? I am afraid &s;he will
grow melancholy from not &s;eeing me &s;o long. Is
&s;he as pretty as &s;he u&s;ed to be? I have &s;ome notion
of &s;ending her a &s;uitor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O brother,&endq; &s;aid Lavinia, &startq;is it po&s;&s;ible you
can have &s;uch &s;pirits?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O hang it, if one is not merry when one can,
what is the world good for? be&s;ides, I do a&s;&s;ure
you, I fretted &s;o con&s;umed hard at fir&s;t, that for the
life of me I can fret no longer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But why are you not at Dr. Marchmont's?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e, my dear, you have no conception the
plea&s;ure tho&s;e old doctors take in lecturing a young|&s;ter
who is in any di&s;grace.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Di&s;grace!&endq; repeated Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;At all events,&endq; &s;aid Lavinia, &startq;I be&s;eech you
to be a little careful; I would not have my poor mo|ther
find you here for the world.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, as to that, I defy her to de&s;ire the meeting
le&s;s than I do. But come, let's talk of &s;omething
el&s;e. How go on the cla&s;&s;ics? Is my old friend, Dr.
Orkborne, as chatty and amu&s;ing as ever?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Lionel,&endq; &s;aid Camilla. &startq;I am filled
with apprehen&s;ion and perplexity. Why &s;hould my
mother wi&s;h not to &s;ee you? And why&mdash;and how is
it po&s;&s;ible you can wi&s;h not to &s;ee her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What, don't you know it all?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know only that &s;omething mu&s;t be wrong;
but how, what, or which way, I have not heard.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Has not Lavinia told you, then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; an&s;wered Lavinia; &startq;I could be in no
ha&s;te to give her pain.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="77">
&startq;You are a good girl enough. But how came
you hither, Camilla? and what is the rea&s;on you
have not &s;een my mother your&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not &s;een her! I have been with her this half
hour.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What! and in all that time did not &s;he tell
you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She did not name you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible!&mdash;Well, &s;he's a noble creature!
I wonder how &s;he could ever have &s;uch a &s;on as me.
And I am &s;till le&s;s like my father than her. I &s;up|po&s;e
I was changed in the cradle. Will you coun|tenance
me, young ladies, if &s;ome villainous attor|ney
or exci&s;eman &s;hould by and by come to own me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear Lionel,&endq; cried Camilla, &startq;do explain to
me what has happened. You make me think it im|portant
and trifling twenty times in a minute.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, a horrid bu&s;ine&s;s!&mdash;Lavinia mu&s;t tell it
you. I'll go away till &s;he has done. Don't de&s;pi&s;e
me, Camilla; I am confounded &s;orry, I promi&s;e
you.&endq;</P>
<P>He then hurried out of the room, evidently feel|ing
more emotion than he cared to di&s;play.</P>
<P>Yet Lavinia had but ju&s;t begun her relation, when
he abruptly returned. &startq;Come, I had better tell it
you my&s;elf,&endq; cried he, &startq;for &s;he'll make &s;uch a di&s;|mal
ditty of it, that it won't be over this half year;
the &s;ooner we have done with it the better; it will
only put you out of &s;pirits.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, &s;itting down, and taking her hand, he
began, &startq;You mu&s;t know I was in rather a bad &s;crape
at Oxford la&s;t year&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;La&s;t year! and you never told us of it before!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, 'twas about &s;omething you would not un|der&s;tand,
&s;o I &s;hall not mention particulars now. It
is enough for you to know that two or three of us
wanted a little ca&s;h!&mdash;well, &s;o&mdash;in &s;hort, I &s;ent a
letter&mdash;&s;omewhat of a threatening &s;ort&mdash;to poor old
uncle Relvil!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;O Lionel!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="78">
&startq;O, I did not &s;ign it,&mdash;it was only begging a
little money, which he can afford to &s;pare very well;
and ju&s;t telling him, if he did not come to a place I
mentioned, he would have his brains blown out.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;How horrible!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pho, pho,&mdash;he had only to &s;end the money,
you know, and then his brains might keep their
place; be&s;ides, you can't &s;uppo&s;e there was gun|powder
in the words. So I got this copied, and
took the proper mea&s;ures for concealment, and,&mdash;
would you believe it! the poor old gull was fool
enough actually to &s;end the money where he was
bid?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fie, Lionel!&endq; cried Lavinia; &startq;do you call
him a fool becau&s;e you terrified him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, to be &s;ure, my dear; and you both think
him &s;o too, only you don't hold it pretty to &s;ay &s;o.
Do you &s;uppo&s;e, if he had had half the wit of his
&s;i&s;ter, he would have done it? I believe, in my con|&s;cience,
there was &s;ome odd mi&s;take in their births,
and that my mother took away the brains of the
man, and left the woman's for the noddle of my
poor uncle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fie, fie, brother!&endq; &s;aid Lavinia again; &startq;you
know how &s;ickly he has always been from his birth,
and how &s;oon therefore he might be alarmed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, yes, Lavinia&mdash;I believe it was a very
bad thing&mdash;and I would give half my little &s;inger I
had not done it. But it's over, you know; &s;o what
&s;ignifies making the wor&s;t of it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And did he not di&s;cover you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No; I gave him particular orders, in my letter,
not to attempt any thing of that &s;ort, a&s;&s;uring him
there were &s;pies about him to watch his proceed|ings.
The good old a&s;s took it all for go&s;pel. So
there the matter dropt. However, as ill luck would
have it, about three months ago we wanted another
&s;um&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And could you again&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, my dear, it was only taking a little of
my own fortune before-hand, for I am his heir; &s;o
<PB N="270" REF="79">
we all agreed it was merely robbing my&s;elf; for we
had &s;everal con&s;ultations about it, and one of us is
to be a lawyer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But you give me &s;ome plea&s;ure here,&endq; &s;aid Ca|milla;
&startq;for I had never heard that my uncle had
made you his heir.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No more have I neither, my dear; but I take
it for granted. Be&s;ides, our little lawyer put it into
my head. Well, we wrote again, and told the poor
old gentleman&mdash;for which I a&s;&s;ure you I am heartily
repentant&mdash;that if he did not &s;end me double the
&s;um, in the &s;ame manner, without delay, his hou&s;e
was to be burnt to the ground the fir&s;t night that he
and all his family were a&s;leep in bed.&mdash;Now don't
make faces and &s;hruggings, for, I promi&s;e you, I
think already I de&s;erve to be hanged for giving him
the fright; though I would not really have hurt
him, all the time, for half his fortune. And who
could have gue&s;&s;ed he would have bit &s;o ea&s;ily? The
money, however, came, and we thought it all &s;e|cure,
and agreed to get the &s;ame &s;um annually.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Annually!&endq; repeated Camilla, with uplifted
hands.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, my dear. You have no conception how
convenient it would have been for our extra ex|pences.
But, unluckily, uncle grew wor&s;e, and
went abroad, and then con&s;ulted with &s;ome crab of
a friend, and that friend with &s;ome demagogue of a
magi&s;trate, and &s;o all is blown!&mdash;However, we had
managed it &s;o cleverly, it co&s;t them near three
months to find it out, owing, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, to
poor uncle's cowardice in not making his enquiries
before the money was carried off, and he him&s;elf
over the &s;eas and far away. The other particulars
Lavinia mu&s;t give you; for I have talked of it now
till I have made my&s;elf quite fick. Do tell me
&s;omething diverting to drive it a little out of my
head. Have you &s;een any thing of my enchanting
widow lately?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, &s;he does not de&s;ire to be &s;een by me. She
would not admit me.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="80">
&startq;She is frankne&s;s it&s;elf, and does not pretend to
care a fig for any of her own &s;ex.&mdash;O, but, Camilla,
I have wanted to a&s;k you this great while, if you
think there is any truth in this rumour, that Mandle|bert

<P>&startq;To propo&s;e! I thought it had all long &s;ince

<P>&startq;Ay, &s;o the world &s;ays; but I don't believe a
word of it. Do you think, if that were the ca&s;e,
he would not have owned it to me? There's nothing
fixed yet, depend upon it.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;truck, amazed, and delighted, invo|luntarily
embraced her brother; though, recollect|ing
her&s;elf almo&s;t at the &s;ame moment, &s;he endea|voured
to turn off the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s impul&s;e into taking
leave, and hurrying him away.</P>
<P>Lionel, who to want of &s;olidity and penetration
principally owed the errors of his conduct, was ea&s;ily
put upon a wrong &s;eent, and a&s;&s;ured her he would
take care to be off in time. &startq;But what,&endq; cried he,
&startq;has carried them to Cleves? Are they gone to tell
tales? Becau&s;e I have lo&s;t one uncle by my own
fault, mu&s;t I lo&s;e another by their's?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; an&s;wered Lavinia, &startq;they have deter|mined
not to name you. They have &s;ettled that my
uncle Hugh &s;hall never be told of the affair, nor any
body el&s;e, if they can help it, except your &s;i&s;ters,
and Dr. Marchmont.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, they are good &s;ouls,&endq; cried he, at|tempting
to laugh, though his eyes were gli&s;tening;
&startq;I wi&s;h I de&s;erved them better; I wi&s;h, too, it
was not &s;o dull to be good. I can be merry and
harmle&s;s here at the &s;ame time,&mdash;and &s;o I can at
Cleves;&mdash;but at Oxford&mdash;or in London,&mdash;your
merry blades there&mdash;I can't deny it, my dear &s;i&s;ters
&mdash;your merry blades there are but &s;ad fellows. Yet
there is &s;uch fun, &s;uch &s;pirit, &s;uch &s;port among&s;t
them, I cannot for my life keep out of their way.
Be&s;ides, you have no conception, young ladies, what
a bye-word you become among them if they catch
you flinching.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="81">
&startq;I would not for the world &s;ay any thing to pain
you, my dear brother,&endq; cried Lavinia; &startq;but yet I
mu&s;t hope that, in future, your fir&s;t &s;tudy will be to
re&s;i&s;t &s;uch dangerous examples, and to drop &s;uch un|worthy
friends?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If it is not to tell tales, then, for what el&s;e are
they gone to Cleves, ju&s;t at this time?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For my mother to take leave of Eugenia and
my uncle before her journey.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Journey! Why, whither i$ &s;he going!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Abroad.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The deuce &s;he is!&mdash;And what for?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To try to make your peace with her brother;
or at lea&s;t to nur&s;e him her&s;elf till he is tolerably re|covered.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel flapped his hat over his eyes, and &s;aying,
&startq;This is too much!&mdash;if I were a man I &s;hould &s;hoot
my&s;elf!&endq;&mdash;ru&s;hed out of the room.</P>
<P>The two &s;i&s;ters rapidly followed him, and caught
his arm before he could quit the hou&s;e. They ear|ne&s;tly
be&s;ought him to return, to compo&s;e him&s;elf,
and to promi&s;e he would commit no ra&s;h action.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear &s;i&s;ters,&endq; cried he, &startq;I am worked ju&s;t
now only as I ought to be; but I will give you any
promi&s;e you plea&s;e. However, though I have never
li&s;tened to my father as I ought to have li&s;tened, he
has implanted in my mind a horror of &s;uicide, that
will make me live my natural life, be it as good for
nothing as it may.&endq;</P>
<P>He then &s;uffered his &s;i&s;ters to lead him back to
their room, where he ca&s;t him&s;elf upon a chair, in
painful rumination upon his own unworthine&s;s, and
his parents excellence; but the tender &s;oothings of
Lavinia and Camilla, who trembled le&s;t his remor&s;e
&s;hould urge him to &s;ome act of violence, &s;oon drew
him from reflections of which he hated the intru&s;ion:
and he attended, with complacency, to their youth|ful
&s;ecurity of perfect reconciliations, and re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>With reciprocal exultation, the eyes of the &s;i&s;ters
congratulated each other on having &s;aved him from
<PB N="273" REF="82">
de&s;pair: and &s;eeing him now calm, and, they hoped,
&s;afe, they mutually, though tacitly, agreed to ob|trude
no further upon meditations that might be u&s;e|ful
to him, and remained &s;ilently by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes all were profoundly &s;till; Lionel
then &s;uddenly &s;tarted up; the &s;i&s;ters, affrighted, ha&s;|tily
aro&s;e at the &s;ame in&s;tant; when &s;tretching him|&s;elf
and yawning, he called out, &startq;Pr'ythee, Ca|milla,
what is become of that &s;mug Mr. Dub&s;ter?&endq;</P>
<P>Speechle&s;s with amazement, they looked earne&s;tly
in his face, and feared he was raving.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon, however undeceived; the tide
of penitence and &s;orrow was turned in his buoyant
&s;pirits, and he was only re&s;tored to his natural vo|latile
&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;You u&s;ed him mo&s;t &s;habbily,&endq; he continued,
&startq;and he was a very pretty fellow. The next time
I have nothing better to do, I'll &s;end him to you,
that you may make it up.&endq;</P>
<P>This quick return of gaiety cau&s;ed a &s;igh to La|vinia,
and much &s;urpri&s;e to Camilla; but neither of
them could prevail with him to depart, till Mr. and
Mrs. Tyrold were every moment expected; they then,
though with infinite difficulty, procured his promi&s;e
that he would go &s;traight to Dr. Marchmont, ac|cording
to an arrangement made for that purpo&s;e by
Mrs. Tyrold her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lavinia, when he was gone, related &s;ome circum|&s;tances
of this affair which he had omitted. Mr.
Relvil, the elder brother of Mrs. Tyrold, was a
country gentleman of &s;ome fortune, but of weak
parts, and an invalid from his infancy. He had &s;uf|fered
the&s;e incendiary letters to prey upon his repo&s;e,
without venturing to produce them to any one, from
a terror of the menaces hurled again&s;t him by the
writer, till at length he became &s;o completely hypo|chondriac,
that his re&s;t was utterly broken, and, to
pre&s;erve his very exi&s;tence, he re&s;olved upon vi&s;iting
another climate.</P>
<P>The day that he &s;et out for Li&s;bon, his de&s;tined
harbour, he delivered his anonymous letters to a
<PB N="274" REF="83">
friend, to whom he left in charge to di&s;cover, if
po&s;&s;ible, their author.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery, by the u&s;ual means of enquiries
and rewards, was &s;oon made; but the moment Mr.
Relvil learnt that the culprit was his nephew, he
wrote over to Mrs. Tyrold a &s;tatement of the tran&s;|action,
declaring he &s;hould di&s;inherit Lionel from
every &s;hilling of his e&s;tate. His health was &s;o much
impaired, he &s;aid, by the di&s;turbance this had given
to his mind, that he &s;hould be obliged to &s;pend the
en&s;uing year in Portugal; and he even felt uncertain
if he might ever return to his own country.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold, a&s;toni&s;hed and indignant, &s;everely
que&s;tioned her &s;on, who, covered with &s;hame, &s;ur|pri&s;e,
and repentance, confe&s;&s;ed his guilt. Shocked
and grieved in the extreme, &s;he ordered him from her
&s;ight, and wrote to Dr. Marchmont to receive him.
She then &s;ettled with Mr. Tyrold the plan of her
journey and voyage, hoping by &s;o immediately fol|lowing,
and her&s;elf nur&s;ing her incen&s;ed brother,
to &s;often his wrath, and avert its final ill con&s;e|quences.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="31" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A few Embarra&s;&s;ments.</HEAD>
<P>MR. and Mrs. Tyrold returned to Etherington
&s;omewhat relieved in their &s;pirits, though perplexed
in their opinions. They had heard from Sir Hugh,
that Edgar had decidedly di&s;avowed any preten&s;ions
to Indiana, and had voluntarily retreated from Cleves,
that his di&s;avowal might ri&s;k no mi&s;con&s;truction,
either in the family or the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>This in&s;en&s;ibility to beauty the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite
wanted no advocate with Mrs. Tyrold. Once more
&s;he conceived &s;ome hope of what &s;he wi&s;hed, and &s;he
<PB N="275" REF="84">
determined upon &s;eeing Edgar before her departure.
The di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he had nouri&s;hed again&s;t him va|ni&s;hed,
and ju&s;tice to his general worth, with an af|fection
nearly maternal to his per&s;on, took again
their wonted place in her bo&s;om, and made her d$em
her&s;elf unkind in having purpo&s;ed to quit the king|dom
without bidding him farewel.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, whom profe&s;&s;ional duty and native
inclination alike made a man of peace, was ever
happy to &s;econd all conciliatory mea&s;ures, and the
fir&s;t to propo&s;e them, where his voice had any
chance of being heard. He &s;ent a note, there|fore,
to invite Edgar to call the next morning;
and Mrs. Tyrold deferred her hour of &s;etting off till
noon.</P>
<P>Her own natural and immediate impul&s;e, had been
to carry Camilla with her abroad; but when &s;he
con&s;idered that her &s;ole errand was to nur&s;e and ap|pea&s;e
an offended &s;ick man, who&s;e chamber &s;he meant
not to quit till &s;he returned to her family, &s;he gave|up
the plea&s;ure &s;he would her&s;elf have found in the
&s;cheme, to her fears for the health and &s;pirits of her
darling child, joined to the &s;uperior joy of leaving
&s;uch a &s;olace with her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh had heard the petition for po&s;tponing&punc;
the further vi&s;it of Camilla almo&s;t with de&s;pondence;
but Mr. Tyrold re&s;tored him completely to confidence,
with re&s;pect to his doubts concerning Dr. Orkborne,
with whom he held a long and &s;atisfactory conver&s;a|tion;
and his own benevolent heart received a &s;en|&s;ible
plea&s;ure, when, upon examining Indiana with
regard to Edgar, he found her, though piqued and
pouted, untouched either in affection or happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Early the next morning Edgar came. Mrs. Ty|rold
had taken mea&s;ures for employing Camilla up
&s;tairs, where &s;he did not even hear that he entered
the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He was received with kindne&s;s, and told of the
&s;udden journey, though not of its motives. He
heard of it with unfeigned concern, and earne&s;tly
<PB N="276" REF="85">
&s;olicited to be the companion of the voyage, if no
better male protector were appointed.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold folded his arms around him at this
grateful propo&s;al, while his wife, animated off her
guard, warmly exclaimed&mdash;&startq;My dear, excellent
Edgar! you are indeed the model, the true &s;on of
your guardian!&endq;</P>
<P>Sorry for what had e&s;caped her, from her internal
reference to Lionel, &s;he looked anxiou&s;ly to &s;ee if he
comprehended her; but the mantling blood which
mounted quick into his cheeks, while his eyes &s;ought
the ground, &s;oon told her there was another mode of
affinity, which at that moment had &s;truck him.</P>
<P>Willing to e&s;tabli&s;h whether this idea were right,
&s;he now con&s;idered how &s;he might name Camilla;
but her hu&s;band, who for no po&s;&s;ible purpo&s;e could
witne&s;s di&s;tre&s;s without &s;eeking to alleviate it, de|clined
his kind offer, and began a di&s;cour&s;e upon the
pa&s;&s;age to Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>This gave Edgar time to recover, and in a few
&s;econds, &s;omething of moment &s;eemed abruptly to oc|cur
to him, and &s;carcely &s;aying adieu, he hurried to
remount his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold was perplexed; but &s;he could take
no &s;teps towards an explanation, without infringing
the delicacy &s;he felt due to her daughter: &s;he &s;uffered
him, therefore, to depart.</P>
<P>She then proceeded with her preparations, which
entirely occupied her till the chai&s;e was at the gate;
when, as the little party, their eyes and their hearts
all full, were taking a la&s;t farewel, the parlour door
was ha&s;tily opened, and Dr. Marchmont and Edgar
entered the room.</P>
<P>All were &s;urpri&s;ed, but none &s;o much as Camilla,
who, forgetting, in &s;udden emotion, every thing but
former kindne&s;s and intimacy, delightedly exclaimed&mdash;
&startq;Edgar! O how happy, my deare&s;t mother!&mdash;I
was afraid you would go without &s;eeing him!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar turned to her with a quickne&s;s that could
only be exceeded by his plea&s;ure; her voice, her
manner, her unlooked-for intere&s;t in his appearance,
<PB N="277" REF="86">
penetrated to his very &s;oul. &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible,&endq; he
cried, &startq;you could have the goodne&s;s to wi&s;h me
this gratification? At a moment &s;uch as this, could
you&mdash;?&endq; think of me, he would have added; but
Dr. Marchmont, coming forward, begged him to
account for their intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t overpowered by his own &s;udden emotion,
he could &s;carce recollect its motive him&s;elf; while
Camilla, fearful and repentant that &s;he had broken
her deliberate and well-principled re&s;olutions, re|treated
to the window.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold witne&s;&s;ed the involuntary
movements which betrayed their mutual regard with
the tendere&s;t &s;atisfaction; and the complacency of
their attention, when Edgar advanced to them, &s;oon
removed his embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>He then briefly acquainted them, that finding
Mrs. Tyrold would not accept him for her chevalier,
he had ridden ha$d to the par&s;onage of Cleves, whence
he hoped he had brought her one too unexception|able
for rejection.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont, with great warmth, then made
a proffer of his &s;ervices, declaring he had long de|&s;ired
an opportunity to vi&s;it Portugal; and prote&s;ting
that, be&s;ides the plea&s;ure of complying with any
wi&s;h of Mr. Mandlebert's, it would give him the
mo&s;t &s;erious happine&s;s to &s;hew his gratitude for the
many kind offices he owed to Mr. Tyrold, and his
high per&s;onal re&s;pect for his lady; he &s;hould require
but one day for his preparations, and for &s;ecuring
the performance of the church duty at Cleves during
his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold were equally &s;truck by the
goodne&s;s of Dr. Marchmont, and the attentive kind|ne&s;s
of Edgar. Mrs. Tyrold, neverthele&s;s, would
immediately have declined the &s;cheme; but her hu&s;|band
interpo&s;ed. Her travelling, he &s;aid, with &s;uch
a guard, would be as conducive to his peace at home,
as to her &s;afety abroad. &startq;And with re&s;pect,&endq; cried
he, &startq;to obligation, I hold it as much a moral duty
not to refu&s;e receiving good offices, as not to avoid
<PB N="278" REF="87">
admini&s;tering them. That &s;pecies of independence,
which proudly flies all ties of gratitude, is inimical
to the &s;ocial compact of civilized life, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
but by reciprocity of &s;ervices.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold now oppo&s;ed the &s;cheme no longer,
and the chai&s;e was ordered for the next day.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont hurried home to &s;ettle his affairs;
but Edgar begged a &s;hort conference with Mr. Ty|rold.</P>
<P>Every maternal hope was now awake in Mrs. Ty|rold,
who concluded this reque&s;t was to demand Ca|milla
in marriage; and her hu&s;band him&s;elf not
without trepidation, took Edgar into his &s;tudy.</P>
<P>But Edgar, though his heart was again wholly
Camilla's, had received a look from Dr. Marchmont
that guarded him from any immediate declaration.
He &s;imply opened upon the late mi&s;conception at
Cleves; vindicated him&s;elf from any ver&s;atility of
conduct, and affirmed, that both his attentions and
his regard for Indiana had never been either more or
le&s;s than they &s;till continued. All this was &s;poken
with a plainne&s;s to which the integrity of his cha|racter
gave a weight &s;uperior to any prote&s;tations.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Edgar,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold, &startq;I am
convinced of your probity. The tenor of your life
is its guarantee, and any other defence is a degrada|tion.
There is, indeed, no perfidy &s;o unju&s;tifiable,
as that which wins but to de&s;ert the affections of an
innocent female. It is &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible, more cow|ardly
than i$ is cruel; for the greater her worth, and
the more exqui&s;ite her feelings, the &s;tronger will be
the impul&s;e of her delicacy to &s;uffer uncomplaining;
and the deluder of her e&s;teem commonly confides, for
averting her reproach, to the very &s;en&s;ibility through
which he has en&s;nared her good opinion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No one,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &startq;can more &s;incerely con|cur
in this &s;entiment than my&s;elf; and I tru&s;t, there
is no &s;ituation, and no character, that could prompt
me to deviate in this point. Here, in particular,
my under&s;tanding mu&s;t have been as defective as my
<PB N="279" REF="88">
morals, to have betrayed me into &s;uch an enter|pri&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How do you mean?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I beg pardon, my dear Sir; but, though I
have a &s;ort of family regard for Mi&s;s Lynmere, and
though I think her beauty is tran&s;cendent, her heart,
I believe&mdash;&endq; he he&s;itated.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you think her heart invulnerable?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why&mdash;no&mdash;not po&s;itively, perhaps,&endq; an&s;wered
he, embarra&s;&s;ed, &startq;not po&s;itively invulnerable; but
certainly I do not think it compo&s;ed of tho&s;e $inely
&s;ubtle &s;en&s;ations which elude all vigilance, and be|come
imperceptibly the prey of every a&s;&s;ailing &s;ym|pathy;
for it&s;elf, therefore, I believe it not in much
danger; and, for others&mdash;I &s;ee not in it that mag|netic
attraction which charms away all caution, be|guiles
all &s;ecurity, enwraps the imagination, and
ma&s;ters the rea&s;on!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>The chain of thinking which, from painting what
he thought in&s;en&s;ible in Indiana, led him to de&s;cribe&punc;
what he felt to be re&s;i&s;tle&s;s in Camilla, made him
fini&s;h the la&s;t &s;entence with an energy that &s;urpri&s;ed
Mr. Tyrold into a &s;mile.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;eem deeply,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;to have &s;tudied
the &s;ubject.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But not under the guidance of Mi&s;s Lynmere,&endq;
he an&s;wered, ri&s;ing, and colouring, the moment he
had &s;poken, in the &s;ear he had betrayed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;I rejoice, then, the more,&endq; replied Mr. Tyrold,
calmly, &startq;in her own &s;lackne&s;s of &s;u&s;ceptibility.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&endq; cried Edgar, recovering, and quietly re|placing
him&s;elf; &startq;it is her own &s;ecurity, and it is
the &s;ecurity of all who &s;urround her; though to
tho&s;e, indeed, there was al&s;o another, a &s;till greater,
in the contra&s;t which&mdash;&endq; he &s;topt, confu&s;ed at his
own meaning; yet pre&s;ently, almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly,
added&mdash;&startq;Not that I think the utmo&s;t vivacity of
&s;entiment, nor all the charm of &s;oul, though eter|nally
beaming in the eyes, playing in every feature,
glowing in the complection, and brightening every
&s;mile&mdash;&endq; he &s;topt again, overpowered with the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the picture he was portraying;
<PB N="280" REF="89">
but Mr. Tyrold continuing &s;ilent, he was obliged,
though he &s;carce knew what he &s;aid, to go on.
&startq;Nothing, in &s;hort, &s;o &s;elfi&s;hly are we formed,&mdash;
that nothing, not even the lovelie&s;t of the lovely,
can be truly bewitching, in which we do not hope or
expect &s;ome participation.&mdash;I believe I have not made
my&s;elf very clear?&mdash;However, it is not material&mdash;
I &s;imply meant to explain my retreat from Cleves.
And, indeed, it is barbarous, at a &s;ea&s;on &s;uch as
this, to detain you a moment from your family.&endq;</P>
<P>He then ha&s;tily took leave.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was &s;en&s;ibly touched by this &s;cene.
He &s;aw, through a di&s;cour&s;e &s;o perplexed, and a
manner &s;o confu&s;ed, that his daughter had made a
forcible impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of Mandlebert,
but could not comprehend why he &s;eemed &s;truggling
to conceal it. What had dropt from his appeared
to imply a di&s;tru&s;t of exciting mutual regard; yet
this, after his own ob&s;ervations upon Camilla, was
inconceivable. He regretted, that at a period &s;o
critical, &s;he mu&s;t part with her mother, with whom
again he now determined to con&s;ult.</P>
<P>Edgar, who hitherto had opened his whole heart
upon every occa&s;ion to Mr. Tyrold, felt hurt and
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at this fir&s;t withholding of confidence. It
was, however, unavoidable, in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>He went back to the parlour to take leave once
more of Mrs. Tyrold; but, opening the door, found
Camilla there alone. She was looking out of the
window, and had not heard his entrance.</P>
<P>This was not a &s;ight to &s;till his perturbed &s;pirits;
on the contrary, the moment &s;eemed to him &s;o fa|vourable,
that it irre&s;i&s;tibly occurred to him to &s;eize
it for removing every doubt.</P>
<P>Camilla, who had not even mi&s;&s;ed her mother and
&s;i&s;ter from the room, was contemplating the hor&s;e of
Edgar, and internally ar$aigning her&s;elf for the dan|gerous
plea&s;ure &s;he had felt and manife&s;ted at the
&s;ight of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>He gently &s;hut the door, and approaching her,
&s;aid, &startq;Do I &s;ee again the &s;ame frank and amiable
<PB N="281" REF="90">
friend, who in earlie&s;t days, who always, indeed,
till&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, turning round, &s;tartled to behold him &s;o
near, and that no one el&s;e remained in the room,
blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively, and without hearing what he &s;aid,
&s;hut the window; yet opened it the &s;ame minute,
&s;tammering out &s;omething, but &s;he her&s;elf knew not
what, concerning the weather.</P>
<P>The gentle&s;t thoughts cro&s;&s;ed the mind of Edgar
at this evident embarra&s;&s;ment, and the mo&s;t generous
alacrity prompted him to ha&s;ten his purpo&s;e. He
drew a chair near her, and, in penetrating accents,
&s;aid: &startq;Will you &s;uffer me, will you, can you per|mit
me, to take the privilege of our long friend&s;hip,
and hone&s;tly to &s;peak to you upon what has pa&s;&s;ed
within the&s;e la&s;t few days at Cleves?&endq;</P>
<P>She could not an&s;wer: &s;urpri&s;e, doubt, fear of
&s;elf-deception, and hope of &s;ome happy explanation,
all &s;uddenly con&s;pired to confound and to &s;ilence her.</P>
<P>&startq;You cannot, I think, forget,&endq; he &s;oon re|&s;umed,
&startq;that you had conde&s;cended to put into my
hands the management and deci&s;ion of the new ac|quaintance
you are anxious to form? My memory,
at lea&s;t, will never be unfaithful to a te&s;timony &s;o
grateful to me, of your entire reliance upon the deep,
the un&s;peakable intere&s;t I have ever taken, and ever
mu&s;t take, in my invaluable guardian, and in every
branch of his re&s;pected and beloved family.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now began to breathe. This la&s;t expre&s;|&s;ion,
though zealous in friendline&s;s, had nothing of
appropriate partiality; and in lo&s;ing her hope &s;he
re&s;umed her calmne&s;s.</P>
<P>Edgar ob&s;erved, though he under&s;tood not, the
change; but as he wi&s;hed to &s;atisfy his mind before
he indulged his inclination, he endeavoured not to be
&s;orry to &s;ee her mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf during the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion.
He wi&s;hed her but to an&s;wer him with
openne&s;s: &s;he &s;till, however, only li&s;tened, while &s;he
ro&s;e and looked about the room for &s;ome work. Ed|gar,
&s;omewhat di&s;concerted, waited for her again
fitting down; and after a few minutes &s;pent in a
<PB N="282" REF="91">
u&s;ele&s;s &s;earch, &s;he drew a chair to a table at &s;ome
di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Gravely then following, he &s;tood oppo&s;ite to her,
and, after a little pau&s;e, &s;aid, &startq;I perceive you think
I go too far? you think that the intimacy of child|hood,
and the attachment of adole&s;cence, &s;hould
expire with the juvenile &s;ports and intercour&s;e which
nouri&s;hed them, rather than ripen into &s;olid friend|&s;hip
and permanent confidence?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do not &s;ay &s;o,&endq; cried &s;he, with emotion; &startq;be|lieve
me, unle&s;s you knew all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and all
my motives, you &s;hould judge nothing of the&s;e la&s;t few
days, but think of me only, whether well or ill, as
you thought of me a week ago.&endq;</P>
<P>The mo&s;t laboured and explicit defence could not
more immediately have &s;atisfied his mind than this
&s;peech. Su&s;picion vani&s;hed, tru&s;t and admiration
took its place, and once more drawing a chair by
her &s;ide, &startq;My dear Mi&s;s Camilla,&endq; he cried, &startq;for|give
my having thus harped upon this &s;ubject; I here
promi&s;e you I will name it no more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And I,&endq; cried &s;he, delighted, &startq;promi&s;e you&endq;&mdash;
&s;he was going to add, that &s;he would give up Mrs.
Arlbery, if he found rea&s;on to di&s;approve the acquaint|ance;
but the parlour door opened, and Mi&s;s Mar|gland
&s;talked into the room.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was going to &s;end a me&s;&s;enger to en|quire
how and when Mrs. Tyrold had &s;et out; but
Mi&s;s Margland, from various motives of curio&s;ity,
offered her &s;ervices, and came her&s;elf. So totally,
however, had both Edgar and Camilla been engro&s;&s;ed
by each other, that they had not heard the carriage
drive up to the garden gate, which, with the door of
the hou&s;e, being always open, required neither knocker
nor bell.</P>
<P>A &s;pectre could not more have &s;tartled or &s;hocked
Camilla. She jumped up, with an exclamation
nearly amounting to a &s;cream, and involuntarily
&s;eated her&s;elf at the other end of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="92">
Edgar, though not equally embarra&s;&s;ed, was &s;till
more provoked; but he ro&s;e, and got her a chair,
and enquired after the health of Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>&startq;He is very poorly, indeed,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, with
an au&s;tere air, &startq;and no wonder!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I$ my uncle ill?&endq; cried Camilla, alarmed.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland deigned no reply.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the family, who had &s;een the carriage
from the windows, now entered the room, and dur|ing
the mutual enquiries and account which followed,
Edgar, believing him&s;elf unob&s;erved, glided round
Camilla, and in a low voice, &s;aid, &startq;The promi&s;e&mdash;
I think I gue&s;s its gratifying import&mdash;I &s;hall not,
I hope, lo&s;e, through this cruel intru&s;ion?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who &s;aw no eyes but tho&s;e of Mi&s;s Mar|gland,
which were &s;everely fa&s;tened upon her, af|fected
not to hear him, and planted her&s;elf in the
group out of his way.</P>
<P>He anxiou&s;ly waited for another opportunity to
put in his claim; but he waited in vain; Camilla,
who from the entrance of Mi&s;s Margland had had the
depre&s;&s;ing feel of &s;elf-accu&s;ation, &s;edulou&s;ly avoided
him; and though he loitered till he was a&s;hamed of
remaining in the hou&s;e at a period &s;o bu&s;y, Mi&s;s
Margland, by indications not to be mi&s;taken, &s;hewed
her&s;elf bent upon out-&s;taying him; he was obliged,
therefore, to depart; though, no &s;ooner was he gone,
than, having nothing more to &s;cru$inize, &s;he went
al&s;o.</P>
<P>But little doubt now remained with the watchful
parents of the mutual attachment of Edgar and Ca|milla,
to which the only apparent ob&s;tacle &s;eemed, a
diffidence on the part of Edgar with re&s;pect to her
internal &s;ympathy. Plea&s;ed with the mode&s;ty of &s;uch
a fear in &s;o accompli&s;hed a young man, Mr. Tyrold
prote&s;ted that, if the &s;uperior fortune were on the &s;ide
of Camilla, he would him&s;elf clear it up, and point out
the mi&s;take. His wife gloried in the virtuous deli|cacy
of her daughter, that &s;o properly, till it was
called for, concealed her tenderne&s;s from the object
who &s;o de&s;ervingly in&s;pired it; yet they agreed, that
<PB N="284" REF="93">
though &s;he could not, at pre&s;ent, meet Edgar too
often, &s;he &s;hould be kept wholly ignorant of their
wi&s;hes and expectations, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;till be
cru&s;hed by any unfore&s;een ca&s;ualty: and that, mean|while,
&s;he &s;hould be allowed every &s;afe and innocent
recreation, that might lighten her mind from its
depre&s;&s;ion, and re&s;tore her &s;pirits to their native vi|vacity.</P>
<P>Early the next morning Dr. Marchmont came to
Etherington, and brought with him Lionel, by the
expre&s;s direction of his father, who never objected
to admit the faulty to his pre&s;ence; his hopes of
doing good were more potent from kindne&s;s than
from &s;everity, from example than from precept: yet
he attempted not to conquer the aver&s;ene&s;s of Mrs.
Tyrold to an interview; he knew it proceeded not
from an inexorable nature, but from a repugnance
in&s;urmountable to the &s;ight of a beloved object in
di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold quitted her hu&s;band with the mo&s;t
cruel regret, and her darling Camilla with the ten|dere&s;t
inquietude; &s;he affectionately embraced the
unexceptionable Lavinia, with whom &s;he left a me&s;|&s;age
for her brother, which &s;he &s;trictly charged her
to deliver, without &s;oftening or omitting one word.</P>
<P>And then, attended by Dr. Marchmont, &s;he &s;et
forward on her journey towards Falmouth: whence
a packet, in a few days, &s;he was informed, would
&s;ail for Li&s;bon.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII.</HEAD>

<P>GRIEVED at this &s;eparation, Mr. Tyrold re|tired
to his &s;tudy; and his two daughters went to
the apartment of Lionel, to comfort him under the
weight of his mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="94">
They found him &s;incerely affected and repentant;
yet eager to hear that his mother was actually gone.
Ill as he felt him&s;elf to de&s;erve &s;uch an exertion for
his future welfare, and poignant as were his &s;hame
and &s;orrow to have parted her from his excellent
father, he thought all evil preferable to encounter|ing
her eye, or li&s;tening to her admonitions.</P>
<P>Though una$$ectedly beloved, Mrs. Tyrold was
deeply feared by all her children, Camilla alone ex|cepted;
by Lionel, from his horror of reproof; by
Lavinia, from the timidity of her humility; and by
Eugenia, from her high &s;en&s;e of parental &s;uperiority.
Camilla alone e&s;caped the contagion; for while too
innocent, too unde&s;igning, wilfully to excite di&s;|plea&s;ure,
&s;he was too gay and too light-hearted to
admit apprehen&s;ion without cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The gentle Lavinia knew not how to perform her
painful ta&s;k of delivering the me&s;&s;age with which &s;he
was commi&s;&s;ioned. The &s;ight of Lionel in dejection
was as &s;ad as it was new to her, and &s;he re&s;olved, in
conjunction with Camilla, to &s;pare him till the next
day, when his feelings might be le&s;s acute. They
each &s;at down, therefore, to work, &s;ilent and com|pa&s;&s;ionate;
while he, ejaculating ble&s;&s;ings upon his
parents, and calling for ju&s;t venge$nce upon him|&s;elf,
&s;troamed up and down the room, biting his
knuckles, and now and then &s;triking his forehead.</P>
<P>This la&s;ted about ten minutes: and then, &s;ud|denly
advancing to his &s;i&s;ters, and &s;natching a hand
of each: &startq;Come, girls,&endq; he cried, &startq;now let's
talk of other things.&endq;</P>
<P>Too young to have developed the character of
Lionel, they were again as much a&s;toni&s;hed as they
had been the preceding day: but his defects, though
not originally of the heart, were of a &s;pecies that
&s;oon tend to harden it. They had their ri&s;e in a
total aver&s;ion to reflection, a wi&s;h to di&s;tingui&s;h him|&s;elf
from his retired, and, he thought, unfa&s;hion|able
relations, and an unfortunate coalition with
&s;ome unprincipled young men, who, becau&s;e fla&s;hy
and gay, could lead him to whatever they propo&s;ed.
<PB N="286" REF="95">
Yet, when mi&s;chief or misfortune en&s;ued from his
wanton faults, he was always far more &s;orry than he
thought it manly to own; but as his actions were
without judgment, his repentance was without prin|ciple;
and he was ready for &s;ome new enterpri&s;e the
moment the difficulties of an old one &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>Camilla, who, from her affection to him, read
his character through the innocence of her own, met
his returning gaiety with a plea&s;ure that was propor|tioned
to her pain at his depre&s;&s;ion; but Lavinia &s;aw
it with di&s;comfort, as the &s;ignal for executing her
charge, and, with extreme reluctance, gave him to
under&s;tand &s;he had a command to fulfil to him from
his mother.</P>
<P>The powers of con&s;cience were again then in|&s;tantly
at work; he felt what he had de&s;erved, he
dreaded to hear what he had provoked; and trem|bling
a$d drawing back, entreated her to wait one
half hour before &s;he entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>She chearfully con&s;ented; and Camilla propo&s;ed
extending the reprieve to the next day: but not two
minutes elap&s;ed, before Lionel prote&s;ted he could
not bear the &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and urged an immediate com|munication.</P>
<P>&startq;She can have &s;aid nothing,&endq; cried he, &startq;wor&s;e
than I expect, or than I merit. Probe me then
without delay. She is acting by me like an angel,
and if &s;he were to command me to turn anchoret, I
know I ought to obey her.&endq;</P>
<P>With much he&s;itation, Lavinia then began. &startq;My
mother &s;$ys, my dear Lionel, the fraud you have
practi&s;ed&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The fraud! what a horrid word! why it was
a mere trick! a joke! a frolic! ju&s;t to make an
old hunks open his pur&s;e-&s;trings for his natural heir.
I am a&s;toni&s;hed at my mother! I really don't care
if I don't hear another &s;yllable.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, my dear Lionel, I will wait till
you are calmer: my mother, I am &s;ure did not mean
to irritate, but to convince.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="96">
&startq;My mother,&endq; continued he, &s;triding about the
room, &startq;makes no allowances. She has no faults
her&s;elf, and for that rea&s;on &s;he thinks nobody el&s;e
&s;hould have any. Be&s;ides, how &s;hould &s;he know
what it is to be a young man? and to want a little
ca&s;h, and not know how to get it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But I am &s;ure,&endq; &s;aid Lavinia, &startq;if you wanted
it for any proper purpo&s;e, my father would have de|nied
him&s;elf every thing, in order to &s;upply you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, yes; but &s;uppo&s;e I want it for a purpo&s;e
that is <HI>not</HI> proper, how am I to get it th$$?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then, my dear Lionel, &s;urely you mu&s;t
be &s;en&s;ible you ought to go without it,&endq; cried the
&s;i&s;ters, in a breath.</P>
<P>&startq;Ay, that's as you girls &s;ay, that know nothing
of the matter. If a young man, when he goes
into the world, was to make &s;uch a &s;peech as that,
he would be pointed at. Be&s;ides, who mu&s;t he live
with? You don't &s;uppo&s;e he is to &s;hut him&s;elf
up, with a few mu&s;ty books, &s;leeping over the fire,
under pretence of &s;tudy, all day long, do you?
like young Melmond, who knows no more of the
world than one of you do?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, &startq;he &s;eemed to me an
amiable and mode&s;t young man, though very ro|mantic.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I dare &s;ay he did! I could have laid any
wager of that. He's ju&s;t a girl's man, ju&s;t the very
thing, all &s;entiment, and poetry and heroics. But
we, my little dear, we lads of &s;pirit, hold all that
amazing cheap. I a&s;&s;ure you, I would as &s;oon be
&s;een trying on a lady's cap at a gla&s;s, as poring over
a crazy old author, when I could help it. I warrant
you think, becau&s;e one is at the univer&s;ity, one mu&s;t
all be book-worms?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, what el&s;e do you go there for but to
&s;tudy?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Every thing in the world, my dear.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But are there not &s;ometimes young men who
are &s;cholars without being book-worms?&endq; cried Ca|milla,
<PB N="288" REF="97">
half colouring; &startq;is not&mdash;is not Edgar Man|dlebert&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes, yes; an odd thing of that &s;ort happens
now and then. Mandlebert has &s;pirit enough to
carry it off pretty well, without being ridiculous;
though he is as deep, for his time, as e'er an old
fellow of a college. But then this is no rule for
others. You mu&s;t not expect an Edgar Mandlebert
at every turn.&endq;</P>
<P>Ah no! thought Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;But, Edgar,&endq; &s;aid Lavinia, &startq;has had an ex|traordinary
education, as well as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing extraor|dinary
talents and goodne&s;s: and you, too, my dear
Lionel, to fulfil what may be expected from you,
&s;hould look back to your father, who was brought
up at the &s;ame univer&s;ity, and is now con&s;idered as
one of the fir&s;t men it has produced. While he was
re&s;pected by the learned for his application, he was
loved even by the indolent for his candour and kind|ne&s;s
of heart. And though his income, as you
know, was &s;o &s;mall, he never ran in debt, and by an
exact but open oeconomy, e&s;caped all imputation of
meanne&s;s: while by forbearing either to conceal, or
repine at his limited fortune, he bl$nted even the
raillery of the di&s;&s;ipated, by frankly and good hu|mouredly
meeting it half way. How often have I
heard my dear mother tell you this!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes; but all this, child, is nothing to the pur|po&s;e;
my father is no more like other men than if
he had been born in another planet, and my at|tempting
to re&s;emble him, is as great a joke, as if
you were to dre&s;s up Mi&s;s Margland in Indiana's
flowers and feathers, and then expect people to call
her a beauty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We do not &s;ay you re&s;emble my father, now,&endq;
&s;aid Camilla, archly; &startq;but is there any rea&s;on why
you &s;hould not try to do it by and by?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes! a little one! nature, nature, my dear,
is in the way. I was born a bit of a buck. I have
no manner of natural ta&s;te for &s;tudy, and poring,
and expounding, and black-letter work. I am a
<PB N="289" REF="98">
light, airy &s;park, at your &s;ervice, not quite &s;o wi&s;e
as I am merry;&mdash;but let that pa&s;s. My father, you
know, is firm as a rock. He minds neither wind
nor weather, nor fleerer nor &s;neerer: but this firm|ne&s;s,
look ye, he has kept all to him&s;elf; not a
whit of it do I inherit; every wind that blows veer$
me about, and makes me look &s;ome new way.&endq;</P>
<P>Soon after, gathering courage from curio&s;ity, he
de&s;ired to hear the me&s;&s;age at once.</P>
<P>Lavinia, unwillingly complying, then repeated:
&startq;The fraud which you have practi&s;ed, my mother
&s;ays, whether from wanton folly to give pain, or
from rapacious di&s;content to gain money, &s;he will

any heart at all, its effects mu&s;t bring its remor&s;e,
&s;ince it has dangerou&s;ly encrea&s;ed the infirmities of
your uncle, driven him to a foreign land, and forced
your mother to for&s;ake her home and family in his
pur&s;uit, unle&s;s &s;he were willing to &s;ee you puni&s;hed
by the entire di&s;inheritance with which you are
threatened. But&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, no more! no more! I am ready to &s;hoot
my&s;elf already! My dear, excellent mother! what
do I not owe you! I had never &s;een, never thought
of the bu&s;ine&s;s in this &s;olemn way before. I meant
nothing at fir&s;t but a &s;illy joke, and all this mi&s;chief
has followed unaccountably. I a&s;&s;ure you, I had
no notion at the beginning he would have minded
the letter; and afterwards, Jack Whi&s;ton per&s;uaded
me, the money was as good as my own, and that it
was nothing but a little cribbing from my&s;elf. I
will never tru&s;t him again; I &s;ee the whole now in
its true and atrocious colours.&mdash;I will devote my&s;elf
in future to make all the amends in my power to my
dear incomparable mother.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters affectionately encouraged this idea,
which produced near a quarter of an hour's &s;erious
thinking and penitence.</P>
<P>He then begged to hear the re&s;t; and Lavinia
continued.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="99">
&startq;But &s;ince you are re-admitted, &s;aid my mother,
to Etherington, by the clemency of your forbearing
father, &s;he charges you to remember, you can only
repay his goodne&s;s by an application the mo&s;t inten&s;e
to tho&s;e &s;tudies you have hitherto neglected, and of
which your neglect has been the cau&s;e of all you$
errors; by committing to idle amu&s;ements the time
that innocently, as well as profitably, ought to have
been dedicated to the attainment of knowledge. She
charges you al&s;o to a&s;k your&s;elf, &s;ince, during the

Finally&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I never wa&s;ted his time! I never de&s;ired to
have any in&s;truction in the vacations. 'Tis the mo&s;t
deuced thing in life to be &s;tudying &s;o hard ince&s;|&s;antly.
The wa&s;te of time is all his own affair;&mdash;
his own choice&mdash;not mine, I a&s;&s;ure you! Go on,
however.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Finally, &s;he adjures you to con&s;ider, that if you
&s;till per&s;evere to con&s;ume your time in wilful negli|gence,
to bury all thought in idle gaiety, and to act
without either reflection or principle, the career of
faults which begins but in unthinking folly, will ter|minate
in &s;hame, in guilt, and in ruin! And though
&s;uch a declen&s;ion of all good, mu&s;t involve your fa|mily
in your affliction, your di&s;grace, &s;he bids me
&s;ay, will ultimately fall but where it ought; &s;ince
your own want of per&s;onal &s;en&s;ibility to the horror
of your conduct, will neither harden nor blind any
human being be&s;ides your&s;elf. This is all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And enough too,&endq; cried he, reddening; &startq;I
am a very wretch!&mdash;I believe that&mdash;though I am
&s;ure I can't tell how; for I never intend any harm,
never think, never dream of hurting any mortal!
But as to &s;tudy&mdash;I mu&s;t own to you, I hate it mo&s;t

<P>&startq;How always you run into the ridiculous!&endq;

<P>&startq;I was never &s;o &s;erious in my life; not that I
&s;hould like to be hor&s;e-ponded in the lea&s;t, though I
would &s;ubmit to it for a puni&s;hment, and out of

over: now the deuce of &s;tudy is, there is no end of
it! And it does &s;o little for one! one can go through
life &s;o well without it! There is not above here and
there an old codger that a&s;ks one a que&s;tion that can
bring it into any play. And then, a turn upon one's
heel, or looking at one's watch, or wondering at
one's &s;hort memory, or happening to forget ju&s;t that
one &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age, carries off the whole in two mi|nutes,
as compltely as if one had been working
one's whole life to get ready for the a&s;&s;ault. And
pray, now, tell me, how can it be worth one's be&s;t
days, one's gaye&s;t hours, the very flower of one's
life&mdash;all to be &s;acrificed to plodding over mu&s;ty
grammars and lexicons, merely to cut a figure ju&s;t
for about two minutes once or twice in a year?&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters, brought up with an early reverence
for learning, as forming a di&s;tingui&s;hed part of the
accompli&s;hments of their father, could not &s;ub&s;cribe
to this argument. But they laughed; and that was
ever &s;ufficient for Lionel, who, though &s;incerely, in
$$ivate, he loved and honoured his father, never be|&s;towed
upon him one voluntary moment that frolic or
folly invited el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Lavinia and Camilla, perfectly relieved now from
all fears for their brother, repaired to the &s;tudy of
their father, anxious to endeavour to chear him, and
to accelerate a meeting and reconciliation for Lionel;
but they found him de&s;irous to be alone, though
kindly, and un&s;olicited, he promi&s;ed to admit his &s;on
before dinner.</P>
<P>Lionel heard this with a ju&s;t awe; but gave it no
time for deep impre&s;&s;ion. It was &s;till very early, and
he could &s;ettle him&s;elf to nothing during the hours
<PB N="292" REF="101">
yet to pa&s;s before the interview. He per&s;uaded his
&s;i&s;ters, therefore, to walk out with him, to wile
away at once expectation and retro&s;pection.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="33" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Modern Notions of Penitence.</HEAD>
<P>THEY &s;et out with no other plan than to take a
three hours &s;troll. Lionel led the way, and they
journied through various plea&s;ant lanes and meadows,
till, about three miles di&s;tance from Etherington,
upon a&s;cending a beautiful little hill, they e&s;pied,
fifty yards off, the Grove, and a party of company
&s;auntering round its grounds.</P>
<P>He immediately propo&s;ed making a vi&s;it to Mrs.
Arlbery; but Lavinia declined pre&s;enting her&s;elf to
a lady who was unknown to her mother; and Ca|milla,
impre&s;&s;ed with the promi&s;e &s;he had intended
for Edgar, which &s;he was &s;ure, though unpro|nounced,
he had comprehended, di&s;&s;ented al&s;o from
the motion.</P>
<P>He then &s;aid he would go alone; for his &s;pirits
were &s;o low from vexation and regret, that they
wanted recruit; and he would return to them by the
time they would be &s;ufficiently re&s;ted to walk home.</P>
<P>To this they agreed; and amu&s;ed them&s;elves with
watching to &s;ee him join the group; in which, how|ever,
they were no &s;ooner gratified, than, to their
great confu&s;ion, they perceived that he pointed them
out, and that all eyes were immediately directed
towards the hill.</P>
<P>Vexed and a&s;toni&s;hed at his quick pa&s;&s;ing penitence,
they ha&s;tened down the declivity, and ran on till a
lane, with an high hedge on each &s;ide, &s;heltered
them from view.</P>
<P>But Lionel, &s;oon pur&s;uing them, &s;aid he brought
the indi&s;putable orders of his invincible widow to
<PB N="293" REF="102">
convoy them to the man&s;ion. She never, &s;he had
owned, admitted formal vi&s;itors, but whatever was
abrupt and out of the way, won her heart.</P>
<P>To the prudent Lavinia, this invitation was by
no means alluring. Mrs. Tyrold, from keeping no
carriage, vi&s;ited but little, and the Grove was not
included in her &s;mall circle; Lavinia, therefore,
though &s;he knew not how to be peremptory, was
&s;teady in refu&s;al; and Camilla, who would naturally
with plea&s;ure have yielded, had a &s;tronger motive for
firmne&s;s, than any with which &s;he was gifted by di&s;|cretion,
in her wi&s;h to oblige Mandlebert. But
Lionel would li&s;ten to neither of them; and when
he found his in&s;i&s;tance in&s;ufficient, &s;eized Lavinia by
one arm, and Camilla by the other, and dragged
them up the hill, in defiance of their entreaties,
and in full view of the party. He then le&s;t the
more pleading, though le&s;s re&s;i&s;ting, Lavinia alone;
but pulled Camilla down by the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, with
a velocity that, though meant but to bring her to
the verge of a &s;mall rivulet, forced her into the
mid&s;t of it &s;o rapidly that he could not him&s;elf at
la&s;t &s;top: and wetted her &s;o completely, that &s;he
could with difficulty, when &s;he got acro&s;s it, walk on.</P>
<P>The violent &s;pirits of Lionel always carried him
beyond his own intentions; he was now really &s;orry
for what he had done: and Lavinia, who had quietly
followed, was unea&s;y from the fear of &s;ome ill con|&s;equence
to her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, who had &s;een the tran&s;action, came
forth now her&s;elf, to invite them all into her hou&s;e,
and offer a fire and dry clothing to Camilla; not
&s;paring, however, her well-merited raillery at the
awkward exploit of young Tyrold.</P>
<P>Camilla, a&s;hamed to be thus &s;een, would have
hidden her&s;elf behind her &s;i&s;ter, and retreated; but
even Lavinia now, fearing for her health, joined in the
reque&s;t, and &s;he was obliged to enter the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery took her up &s;tairs, to her own
apartment, and &s;upplied her immediately with a com|plete
change of apparel; prote&s;ting that Lionel
<PB N="294" REF="103">
&s;hould be puni&s;hed for his frolic, by a &s;olitary walk
to Etherington, to announce that &s;he would keep
his two &s;i&s;ters for the day.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition was vain; &s;he was gay, good-hu|moured,
and plea&s;ant, but &s;he would not be denied.
She meant not, however, to inflict the &s;erious pe|nalty
which the face of Lionel proclaimed him to be
&s;uffering, when he prepared to depart; and the &s;i&s;|ters,
who read in it his dread of meeting Mr. Ty|rold
alone, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of his af|fairs,
conferred together, and agreed that Lavinia
&s;hould accompany him, both to intercede for return|ing
favour from his father, and to explain the acci|dent
of Camilla's &s;taying at the Grove. Mrs. Arl|bery,
meanwhile, promi&s;ed to re&s;tore her young
gue&s;t &s;afe at night in her own carriage.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the plea&s;ure with which Camilla,
in any other &s;ituation, would have renewed this ac|quaintance,
was now changed into reluctance, &s;he
was far from in&s;en&s;ible to the flattering kindne&s;s with
which Mrs. Arlbery received and entertained her,
nor to the frankne&s;s with which &s;he confe&s;&s;ed, that
her invi&s;ibility the other morning, had re&s;ulted &s;olely
from pique that the vi&s;it had not been made &s;ooner.</P>
<P>Camilla would have attempted &s;ome apology for
the delay, but &s;he a&s;&s;ured her apologies were what
&s;he neither took nor gave; and then laughingly
added&mdash;&startq;We will try one another to-day, and if
we find it won't do&mdash;we will &s;hake hands and part.
That, you mu&s;t know, is my mode; and is it not
va&s;tly better than keeping up an acquaintance that
proves dull, merely becau&s;e it has been begun?&endq;</P>
<P>She then ordered away all her vi&s;itors, without
the &s;malle&s;t ceremony; telling them, however, they
might come back in the evening, only de&s;iring they
would not be early. Camilla &s;tared; but they all
&s;ubmitted as to a thing of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;You are not u&s;ed to my way, I perceive,&endq; cried
&s;he, &s;miling; &startq;yet, I can neverthele&s;s a&s;&s;ure you,
you can do nothing &s;o much for your happine&s;s as to
adopt it. You are made a &s;lave in a moment by the
<PB N="295" REF="104">
world, if you don't begin life by defying it. Take
your own way, follow your own humour, and you
and the world will both go on ju&s;t as well, as if you
a&s;k its will and plea&s;ure for every thing you do, and
want, and think.&endq;</P>
<P>She then expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf delighted with Lionel,
for bringing them together by this &s;hort cut, which
aboli&s;hed a world of formalities, not more cu&s;tomary
than fatiguing. &startq;I pa&s;s, I know,&endq; continued &s;he,
&startq;for a mere creature of whim; but, believe me,
there is no &s;mall touch of philo&s;ophy in the compo|&s;ition
of my vagaries. Extremes, you know, have
a mighty knack of meeting. Thus I, like the &s;age,
though not with &s;age-like motives, &s;ave time that
mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be wa&s;ted; brave rules that would
murder common &s;en&s;e; and when I have made peo|ple
&s;tare, turn another way that I may laugh.&endq;</P>
<P>She then, in a graver &s;train, and in a manner that
proved the laws of politene&s;s all her own, where &s;he
cho&s;e, for any particular purpo&s;e, or inclination, to
exert them, hoped this profe&s;&s;ion of her faith would
plead her excu&s;e, that &s;he had thus incongruou&s;ly
made her fair gue&s;t a &s;econd time enter her hou&s;e,
before her fir&s;t vi&s;it was acknowledged; and en|quired
whether it were to be returned at Ethering|ton
or at Cleves.</P>
<P>Camilla an&s;wered, &s;he was now at home, on ac|count
of her mother's being obliged to make a voy|age
to Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery &s;aid, &s;he would certainly, then,
wait upon her at Etherington; and very civilly re|gretted
having no acquaintance with Mrs. Tyrold;
archly, however, adding: &startq;As we have no where
met, I could not &s;eek her at her own hou&s;e without
running too great a ri&s;k; for then, whether I had
liked her or not, I mu&s;t have received her, you know,
into mine. So, you &s;ee, I am not quite without
prudence, whatever the dear world &s;ays to the con|trary.&endq;</P>
<P>She then &s;poke of the ball, public breakfa&s;t, and
raffle; chatting both upon per&s;ons and things with
<PB N="296" REF="105">
an ea&s;y gaiety, and &s;prightly negligence, extremely
amu&s;ing to Camilla, and which &s;oon, in de&s;pight of
the unwillingne&s;s with which &s;he had entered her
hou&s;e, brought back her original propen&s;ity to make
the acquaintance, and le&s;t no regret for what Lionel
had done, except what re&s;ted upon the repugnance
of Edgar to this intercour&s;e. As he could not;
however, reproach what was begun without her con|currence,
he would &s;ee, &s;he hoped, like her&s;elf, that
common civility henceforward would exact its con|tinuance.</P>
<P>In proportion as her plea&s;ure from this accidental
commerce was awakened, and her early partiality re|vived,
her own &s;pirits re-animated, and, in the
cour&s;e of the many hours they now &s;pent completely
together, &s;he was &s;et &s;o entirely at her ea&s;e, by the
good humour of Mrs. Arlbery, that &s;he lo&s;t all fear
of her wit. She found it rather playful than &s;atiri|cal;
rather &s;eeking to amu&s;e than to di&s;concert; and
though &s;ometimes, from the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s plea&s;ure of ut|tering
a <HI>bon mot</HI> &s;he thought more of its brilliancy
than of the pain it might inflict, this happened but
rarely, and was more commonly &s;ucceeded by regret
than by triumph.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;oon ob&s;erved &s;he had, per&s;onally, nothing
to apprehend, peculiar partiality &s;upplying the place
of general delicacy, in &s;hielding her from every &s;haft
that even plea&s;antry could render poignant. The
embarra&s;&s;ment, therefore, which, in ingenuous youth,
checks the attempt to plea&s;e, by $ear of failure, or
&s;hame of exertion, gave way to natural &s;pirits, which
gaily ri&s;ing from entertainment received, re&s;tored her
vivacity, and gradually, though uncon&s;ciou&s;ly, en|abled
her to do ju&s;tice to her own abilities, by unaf|fectedly
calling forth the mingled &s;weetne&s;s and in|telligence
of her character; and Mrs. Arlbery,
charmed with all &s;he ob&s;erved, and flattered by all
&s;he in&s;pired, felt &s;uch &s;atisfaction in her evident con|que&s;t,
that before the <HI>t&eacute;te &agrave; t&eacute;te</HI> was clo&s;ed, their ad|miration
was become nearly mutual.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="106">
When the evening party was announced, they
both heard with &s;urpri&s;e that the day was &s;o far ad|vanced.
&startq;They can wait, however,&endq; &s;aid Mrs.
Arlbery, &startq;for I know they have nothing to do.&endq;</P>
<P>She then invited Camilla to return to her the next
day for a week.</P>
<P>Camilla felt well di&s;po&s;ed to comply, hoping &s;oon
to rea&s;on from Edgar his prejudice again&s;t a connec|tion
that afforded her &s;uch &s;ingular plea&s;ure; but to
leave her father at this period was far from every
wi&s;h. She excu&s;ed her&s;elf, therefore, &s;aying, &s;he
had &s;till &s;ix weeks due to her uncle at Cleves, before
any other engagement could take place.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, when you quit your home for Sir
Hugh, will you beg off a few days from him, and
&s;et them down to my account?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If my uncle plea&s;es&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If he plea&s;es?&endq; repeated &s;he, laughing; &startq;pray
never give that <HI>If</HI> into his deci&s;ion; you only put
contradiction into people's heads, by a&s;king what
plea&s;es them. Say at once, My good uncle, Mrs.
Arlbery has invited me to indulge her with a few
days at the Grove; &s;o to-morrow I &s;hall go to her.
Will you promi&s;e me this?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear madam, no! my uncle would think me
mad.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And &s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould? A little alarm now
and then keeps life from &s;tagnation. They call me
mad, I know, &s;ometimes; wild, &s;lighty, and what
not; yet you &s;ee how harmle&s;s I am, though I
afford food for &s;uch notable commentary.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But can you really like &s;uch things &s;hould be
&s;aid of you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I adore the frankne&s;s of that que&s;tion! why,
n&mdash;o,&mdash;I rather think I don't. But I'm not &s;ure.
However, to prevent their minding me, I mu&s;t mind
them. And it's va&s;tly more irk&s;ome to give up one's
own way, than to hear a few impertinent remarks.
And as to the world, depend upon it, my dear Mi&s;s
Tyrold, the more you &s;ee of it, the le&s;s you will
care for it.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="107">
She then &s;aid &s;he would leave her to re-inve&s;t her|&s;elf
in her own attire, and go down &s;tairs, to &s;ee
what the poor &s;imple &s;ouls, who had had no more
wit than to come back thus at her call, had found
to do with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Camilla, having only her common morning dre&s;s,
and even that utterly &s;poilt, begged that her appear|ance
might be di&s;pen&s;ed with; but Mrs. Arlbery,
exclaiming, &startq;Why, there are only men; you don't
mind men, I hope!&endq; a&s;hamed, &s;he promi&s;ed to get
ready; yet &s;he had not &s;ufficient courage to de&s;cend,
till her gay ho&s;te&s;s came back, and accompanied her
to the drawing room.</P>

<P>UPON entering the room, Camilla &s;aw again the
Officers who had been there in the morning, and
who were now joined by Sir Sedley Clarendel. She
was met at the door by Major Cerwood, who &s;eemed
waiting for her appearance, and who made her his
compliments with an air that &s;tudiou&s;ly proclaimed
his devotion. She &s;eated her&s;elf by the &s;ide of Mrs.
Arlbery, to look on at a game of che&s;s, played by
Sir Sedley and General Kin&s;ale.</P>
<P>&startq;Clarendel,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;you have
not the lea&s;t in the world the air of knowing what
you are about.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon me, ma'am,&endq; &s;aid the General, &startq;he
has been at lea&s;t half an hour contemplating this
very move,&mdash;for which, as you &s;ee, I now check|mate
him. Pray, Sir Sedley, how came you, at
la&s;t, to do no better?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thinking of other things, my dear General.
'Tis impo&s;&s;ible in the extreme to keep one's faculties
pinioned down to the ab&s;tru&s;e vagaries of this brain|besieging

game. My head would be deranged pa&s;t
redre&s;s, if I did not allow it to vi&s;it the four quar|ters
of the globe once, at lea&s;t, between every
move.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You do not play &s;o &s;low, then, from delibe|rating
upon your chances, but from from forgetting
them?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Defined, my dear General, to &s;crupulo&s;ity!
Tho&s;e exqui&s;ite little moments we &s;teal from any
given occupation, for the plea&s;ure of &s;peculating in
&s;ecret upon &s;omething wholly foreign to it, are re|&s;i&s;tle&s;s
to deliciou&s;ne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I entreat, and command you then,&endq; cried
Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;to make your &s;peculations public.
Nothing will more amu&s;e me, than to have the lea&s;t
intimation of the &s;ubjects of your reveries.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Mrs. Arlbery! your demand is the
very quinte&s;&s;ence of impo&s;&s;ibility! Tell the &s;ubject
of a reverie! know you not it wafts one at once ou$
of the world, and the world's powers of expre&s;&s;ion?
while all it &s;ub&s;titutes is as evane&s;cent as it is delect|able.
To attempt the lea&s;t de&s;cription would be a
pre&s;umption of the fir&s;t mon&s;trou&s;ne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O never heed that! pre&s;umption will not pre|ci&s;ely
be a novelty to you; an&s;wer me, therefore,
my dear Clarendel, without all this conceit. You
know I hate procra&s;tination; and procra&s;tinators
&s;till wor&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Softly, deare&s;t madam, &s;oftly! There is no|thing
in nature &s;o horribly &s;hocking to me as the
lea&s;t hurry. My poor nerves &s;eek repo&s;e after any
turbulent words, or jarring &s;ounds, with the &s;ame
craving for re&s;t that my body experiences after the
jolts, and concu&s;&s;ions of a long-winded cha&s;e. By
the way, does any body want a good hunter? I
have the fir&s;t, perhaps, in Europe; but I would
&s;ell it a &s;urpri&s;ing bargain, for I am excruciatingly
tired of it.&endq;</P>
<P>All the gentlemen grouped round him to hear fur|ther
particulars, except Mr. Macder&s;ey, the young

the Northwick ball, and who now, approaching Ca|milla,
fervently exclaimed; &startq;How happy I &s;hould

to &s;ee you meet with that accident this morning, in|&s;tead
of being looking another way! I might then
have had the plea&s;ure to a&s;&s;i&s;t you. And O! how
much more if it had been your divine cou&s;in! I

&s;ame, which I dare &s;ay it is, by her &s;miles and deli|cate
dimples, &s;he mu&s;t be a paragon upon earth!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There is at lea&s;t &s;omething very inartificial in
your prai&s;e,&endq; &s;aid General Kin&s;ale, &startq;when you
make your panegyric of an ab&s;ent lady to a pre&s;ent
one.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O General, there is not a lady living can bear
any compari&s;on with her. I have never had her out
of my thoughts from the fir&s;t darling moment that
ever I &s;aw her, which has made me the mo&s;t mi|&s;erable
of men ever &s;ince. Her eyes &s;o beautiful,
her mouth &s;o divine, her no&s;e &s;o heavenly!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And how,&endq; cried Sir Sedley, &startq;is the tip of
her chin?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No joking, Sir!&endq; &s;aid the En&s;ign, reddening;
&startq;&s;he is a piece of perfection not to be laughed at;
&s;he has never had her fellow upon the face of the
earth; and &s;he never will have it while the earth
holds, upon account of there being no &s;uch per&s;on
above ground.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And pray,&endq; cried Sir Sedley, carele&s;sly, &startq;how
can you be &s;ure of that?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How! why by being certain,&endq; an&s;wered the
inflamed admirer; &startq;for though I have been look|ing
out for pretty women from morning to night,
ever &s;ince I was con&s;cious of the right u&s;e of my

Major Cerwood took in charge all attendance

&startq;What in the world have you brought me?&endq; cried
&s;he; &startq;Is it tea? It looks prodigiou&s;ly as if ju&s;t im|ported
out of the &s;top ba&s;on. For pity &s;ake, Mac|der&s;ey,
ari&s;e, and give me your help; you will at
lea&s;t never bring me &s;uch maudlin &s;tuff as this. Even
your tea will have &s;ome character; it will be very
good or very bad; very hot or very cold; very &s;trong
or very weak; for you are always in flames of fire,
or &s;lakes of &s;now.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You do me ju&s;tice, ma'am; there is nothing
upon the face of the earth &s;o in&s;ipid as a medium.
Give me love or hate! a friend that will go to jail
for me, or an enemy that will run me through the
body! Riches to chuck guineas about-like half-pence,
or poverty to beg in a ditch! Liberty wild
as the four winds, or an oar to work in a galley!
Mi&s;ery to tear my heart into an hundred thou&s;and
millions of atoms, or joy to make my foul dance into
my brain! Every thing has &s;ome gratification, ex|cept
a medium. 'Tis a poor little &s;oul that is &s;ati&s;|fied
between happine&s;s and de&s;pair.&endq;</P>
<P>He then flew to bring her a di&s;h of tea.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="111">
&startq;My dear Macder&s;ey,&endq; cried &s;he, in receiving it,
&startq;this is according to your &s;y&s;tem indeed; for 'tis
a compound of &s;trong, and rich, and &s;weet, to cloy
an alderman, making altogether &s;o lu&s;cious a &s;yrup,
that our &s;pring would be exhau&s;ted before I could
&s;lake my thir&s;t, if I &s;hould ta&s;te it only a &s;econd
time. Do, dear General, &s;ee if it is not po&s;&s;ible to
get me &s;ome beverage that I can &s;wallow.&endq;</P>
<P>The younge&s;t man pre&s;ent was not more active
than the General in this &s;ervice; but Mrs. Arlbery,
ca&s;ting her&s;elf de&s;pondingly back the moment &s;he
had ta&s;ted what he brought her, exclaimed, &startq;Why
this is wor&s;t of all! If you can do no better for me,
General, than this, tell me, at lea&s;t, for mercy's
&s;ake, when &s;ome other regiment will be quartered
here?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What a cruelty,&endq; &s;aid the Major, looking
with a &s;igh towards Camilla, &startq;to remind your un|happy
prey they are but birds of pa&s;&s;age!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, all the better, Major. If you under&s;tand
your own intere&s;t you will be as eager to break up
your quarters, as I can be to &s;ee your &s;ucce&s;&s;ors
march into them. I have now heard-all your com|pliments,
and you have heard all my repartees; both
&s;ides, therefore, want new auditors. A great many
things I have &s;aid to you will do va&s;tly well again
for a new corps; and, to do you ju&s;tice, &s;ome few
things you have &s;aid your&s;elves may do again in a
new county.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, addre&s;&s;ing Camilla, &s;he propo&s;ed, though
without moving, that they &s;hould conver&s;e with one
another, and leave the men to take care of them|&s;elves.
&startq;And exce&s;&s;ively they will be obliged to
me,&endq; &s;he continued, without lowering her voice,
&startq;for giving this little holiday to their poor brains;
for, I a&s;&s;ure you, they have not known what to &s;ay
this half hour. Indeed, &s;ince the fir&s;t fortnight
they were quartered here, they have not, upon an
average, &s;aid above one new thing in three days.
But one's obliged to take up with Officers in the
<PB N="303" REF="112">
country, becau&s;e there's almo&s;t nothing el&s;e. Can
you recommend me any agreeable new people?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O no, ma'am! I have hardly any acquaintance,
except immediately round the rectory; but, fortu|nately,
my own family is &s;o large, that I have never
been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for &s;ociety.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, ay, true! your own family, begin with
that; do, pray, give me a little hi&s;tory of your own
family?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have no hi&s;tory, ma'am, to give, for my fa|ther's
retired life&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I have &s;een your father, and I have heard
him preach, and I like him very much. There's
&s;omething in him there's no turning into ridicule.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, though &s;urpri&s;ed, was delighted by &s;uch a
te&s;timony to the re&s;pectability of her father; and,
with more courage, &s;aid&mdash;&startq;And, I am &s;ure, if you
knew my mother, you would allow her the &s;ame ex|emption.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So I hear; therefore, we won't talk of them.
It's a delightful thing to think of perfection; but
it's va&s;tly more amu&s;ing to talk of errors and ab&s;ur|dities.
To begin with your elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, then&mdash;but
no; &s;he &s;eems in ju&s;t the &s;ame predicament as your
father and mother: &s;o we'll let her re&s;t, too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed &s;he is; &s;he is as faultle&s;s&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, not a word more then; &s;he won't do for me
at all. But, pray, is there not a &s;ingle &s;oul in all the
round of your large family, that can afford a body a
little innocent diver&s;ion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, madam,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, &s;haking her head;
&startq;I fear, on the contrary, if they came under your
examination, there is not one in whom you would
not di&s;cern &s;ome foible!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould not like them at all the wor&s;e for that;
for, between our&s;elves, my dear Mi&s;s Tyrold, I am
half afraid they might find a foible or two in return
in me; &s;o you mu&s;t not be angry if I beg the favour
of your to indulge me with a few of their defects.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indulge you!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="113">
&startq;Yes, for when &s;o many of a family are perfect,
if you can't find me one or two that have a little
&s;p$ck of mortality, you mu&s;t not wonder if I take
flight at your very name. In charity, therefore, if
you would not drop my acquaintance, tell me their
vulnerable parts&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla laughed at this ridiculous rea&s;oning, but
would not enter into its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, if you will not a&s;&s;i&s;t me, don't take
it ill that I a&s;&s;i&s;t my&s;elf. In the fir&s;t place, there's
your brother; I don't a&s;k you to tell me any thing
of him; I have &s;een him! and I confe&s;s to you he
does not put me into utter de&s;pair! he does not
alarm me into flying all his race.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla tried vainly to look grave.</P>
<P>&startq;I have &s;een another, too, your cou&s;in, I think;
Mi&s;s Lynmere, that's engaged to young Mandlebert.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now tried as vainly to look gay.</P>
<P>&startq;She's prodigiou&s;ly pretty. Pray, is not &s;he a
great &s;ool?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ma'am?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I beg your pardon! but I don't &s;uppo&s;e you are
re&s;pon&s;ible for the intellects of all your generation.
However, &s;he'll do va&s;tly well; you need not be
unea&s;y for her. A face like that will take very good
care of it&s;elf. I am glad &s;he is engaged, for your
&s;ake, though I am &s;orry for Mandlebert; that is, if,
as his cla&s;s of countenance generally predicts, he
marries with any notion of expecting to be happy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But why, ma'am,&endq; cried Camilla, checking a
&s;igh, &startq;are you glad for my &s;ake?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e there are two rea&s;ons why &s;he would be
wonderfully in your way; &s;he is not only prettier
than you, but &s;illier.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And would both tho&s;e rea&s;ons,&endq; cried Camilla,
again laughing, &startq;make again&s;t me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, intolerably, with the men! They are al|ways
enchanted with &s;omething that is both pretty
and &s;illy; becau&s;e they can &s;o ea&s;ily plea&s;e and &s;o
&s;oon di&s;concert it; and when they have made the
little blooming fools blu&s;h and look down, they feel
<PB N="305" REF="114">
nobly &s;uperior, and pride them&s;elves in victory.
Dear creatures! I delight in their ta&s;te; for it brings
them a plentiful harve&s;t of repentance, when it is
their connubial criterion; the pretty flies off, and
the &s;illy remains, and a man then has a choice com|panion
for life left on his hands!&endq;</P>
<P>The young En&s;ign here could no longer be &s;ilent:
&startq;I am &s;ure and certain,&endq; cried he, warmly, &startq;Mi&s;s
Lynmere is incapable to be a fool! and when &s;he
marries, if her hu&s;band thinks her &s;o, it's only a &s;ign
he's a blockhead him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He'll be exactly of your opinion for the fir&s;t
month or two,&endq; an&s;wered Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;or even
if he is not, he'll like her ju&s;t as well. A man looks
enchanted while his beautiful young bride talks non|&s;en&s;e;
it comes &s;o prettily from her ruby lips, and
&s;he blu&s;hes and dimples with &s;uch lovely attraction
while &s;he utters it; he ca&s;ts his eyes around him with
con&s;cious elation to &s;ee her admirers, and his enviers;
but he has amply his turn for looking like a fool
him&s;elf, when youth and beauty take flight, and
when his ugly old wife expo&s;es her ignorance or folly
at every word.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The contra&s;t of beginning and end,&endq; &s;aid the
General, &startq;is almo&s;t always melancholy. But how
rarely does any man,&mdash;nay, I had nearly &s;aid, or any
woman&mdash;think a moment of the time to come, or of
any time but the pre&s;ent day, in marrying?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Except with re&s;pect to fortune!&endq; cried Mrs.
Arlbery, &startq;and there, methinks you men, at lea&s;t,
are commonly &s;ufficiently provident. I don't think
reflection is generally what you want in that point.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to reflection,&endq; exclaimed Mr. Macder&s;ey,
&startq;'tis the thing in the world I look upon to be the
meane&s;t! a man capable of reflection, where a beau|tiful
young creature is in que&s;tion, can have no &s;oul
nor vitals. For my part, 'tis my only misfortune
that I cannot get at that lovely girl, to a&s;k her for
her private opinion of me at once, that I might
either get a licence to-morrow, or drive her out of
my head before &s;leep overtakes me another night.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="115">
&startq;Your pa&s;&s;ions, my good Macder&s;ey,&endq; &s;aid Mrs.
Arlbery, &startq;con&s;idering their violence, &s;eem tolerably
obedient. Can you really be &s;o fond, or &s;o forget|ful
at &s;uch &s;hort warning?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, but it's with a pain that breaks my heart
every time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You contrive, however, to get it pretty &s;oon
mended!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That, madam, is a power that has come upon
me by degrees; I have paid dear enough for it!&mdash;nobody
ever found it harder than I did at the be|ginning;
for the fir&s;t two or three times I took my
di&s;appointments &s;o to heart, that I &s;hould have been
bound for ever to any friend that would have had the
good nature to blow my brains out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But now you are &s;o much in the habit of expe|riencing
the&s;e little failures, that they pa&s;s on as
things of cour&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, madam, you injure me, and in the tendere&s;t
point; for, as long as I have the lea&s;t hope, my
pa&s;&s;ion's as violent as ever; but you would not be &s;o
unrea&s;onable as to have a man love on, when it can
an&s;wer no end? It's no better than making him un|happy
for a joke. There's no &s;en&s;e in &s;uch a thing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By the way, my dear Mi&s;s Tyrold, and <HI>apropos</HI>
to this Mi&s;s Lynmere,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;do tell
me &s;omething about Mr. Mandlebert&mdash;what is he?&mdash;what
does he do always among&s;t you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He&mdash;he!&mdash;&endq; cried Camilla, &s;tammering, &startq;he
was a ward of my father's&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I don't mean all that; but what is hi$
&s;tyle?&mdash;his cla&s;s?&mdash;is he agreeable?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I believe&mdash;he is generally thought &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If he is, do pray, then, draw him into my &s;o|ciety,
for I am terribly in want of recruits. The&s;e
poor gentlemen you &s;ee here are very good &s;ort of
men; but they have a trick of &s;leeping with their
eyes wide open, and fancy all the time they are
awake; and, indeed, I find it hard to per&s;uade them
to the contrary, though I often a&s;k them for their
<PB N="307" REF="116">
dreams. By the way, can't you contrive, &s;ome or
other among&s;t you, to make the room a little cooler?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Shall I open this window?&endq; &s;aid the Major.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, nay, don't a&s;k me; I had rather bear &s;ix
times the heat, than give my own directions: no|thing
in the world fatigues me &s;o much as telling
&s;tupid people how to &s;et about things. Colonel, don't
you &s;ee I have no fan?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'll fetch it directly&mdash;have you left it in the
dining-parlour?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you really think I would not &s;end a footman
at once, if I mu&s;t perplex my&s;elf with all that re|collection?
My dear Mi&s;s Tyrold, did you ever &s;ee
any poor people, that pretended at all to walk about,
and mingle with the re&s;t of the world, like living
creatures, &s;o completely lethargic?&mdash;'tis really quite
melancholy! I am &s;ure you have good nature enough
to pity them. It requires my utmo&s;t ingenuity to
keep them in any employment; and if I left them
to them&s;elves, they would &s;tand before the fire all the
winter, and lounge upon &s;ofas all the &s;ummer. And
that indolence of body &s;o entirely unnerves the mind,
that they find as little to &s;ay as to do. Upon the
whole, 'tis really a paltry race, the men of the pre|&s;ent
times. However, as we have got no better, and
as the women are wor&s;e, I do all I can to make them
le&s;s in&s;ufferable to me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And do you really think the women are wor&s;e?&endq;
cried Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;Not in them&s;elves, my dear; but wor&s;e to me,
becau&s;e I cannot po&s;&s;ibly take the &s;ame liberties with
them. Macder&s;ey, I wi&s;h I had my &s;alts.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It &s;hall be the happine&s;s of my life to find them,
be they hid where they may; only tell me where I
may have the plea&s;ure to go and look for them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, that's your affair.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then, if they are to be found from the
garret to the cellar, be &s;ure I am a dead man, if I
do not bring them you!&endq;</P>
<P>This mode of di&s;playing airs and graces was &s;o per|fectly
new to Camilla, that the commands i&s;&s;ued, and
<PB N="308" REF="117">
the obedience paid, were equally amu&s;ing to her.
Brought up her&s;elf to be contented with whatever
came in her way, in preference either to giving
trouble, or finding fault, the ridiculous, yet playful
wilfulne&s;s with which &s;he &s;aw Mrs. Arlbery &s;end
every one upon her errands, yet object to what every
one performed, pre&s;ented to her a &s;cene of &s;uch
whim&s;ical gaiety, that her concern at the accident
which had made her innocently violate her intended
engagement with Edgar, was completely changed
into plea&s;ure, that thus, without any po&s;&s;ible &s;elf
blame, an acquaintance &s;he had &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired
was even by nece&s;&s;ity e&s;tabli&s;hed: and &s;he returned
home at night with &s;pirits all revived, and eloquent
in prai&s;e of her new favourite.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="35" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Attic Adventures.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Tyrold, according to the &s;y&s;tem of recreation
which he had &s;ettled with his wife, &s;aw with &s;ati&s;|faction
the plea&s;ure with which Camilla began this
new acquaintance, in the hope it would help to &s;up|port
her &s;pirits during the interval of &s;u&s;pen&s;e with
regard to the purpo&s;es of Mandlebert. Mrs. Arl|bery
was unknown to him, except by general fame;
which told him &s;he was a woman of reputation as
well as fa&s;hion, and that though her manners were
lively, her heart was friendly, and her hand ever
open to charity.</P>
<P>Upon admitting Lionel again to his pre&s;ence, he
&s;poke forcibly, though with brevity, upon the cul|pability
of his conduct. What he had done, he
&s;aid, let him colour it to him&s;elf with what levity he
might, was not only a robbery, but a robbery of the
mo&s;t atrocious and unju&s;tifiable cla&s;s; adding terror
to violation of property, and playing upon the &s;u&s;|ceptibility
of the weakne&s;s and infirmities, which he
<PB N="309" REF="118">
ought to have been the fir&s;t to have &s;heltered and
&s;heathed. Had the action contained no purpo&s;e but
a frolic, even then the &s;ituation of the object on
whom it fell, rendered it inhuman; but as its aim and
end was to obtain money, it was di&s;honourable to
his character, and criminal by the laws of his country.
&startq;Yet &s;hudder not more,&endq; continued he, &startq;young
man, at the ju&s;tice to which they make you amen|able,
than at having de&s;erved, though you e&s;cape it!
From this day, however, I will name it no more.
Feeble mu&s;t be all I could utter, compared with what
the lea&s;t reflection mu&s;t make you feel! Your uncle,
in a broken &s;tate of health, is &s;ent abroad: your
mother, though too ju&s;tly incen&s;ed to &s;ee you, &s;a|crifices
her happine&s;s to &s;erve you!&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel, for a few hours, was in de&s;pair after this
harangue; but as they pa&s;&s;ed away, he &s;trove to
drive it from his mind, per&s;uading him&s;elf it was
u&s;ele&s;s to dwell upon what was irretrievable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, the following day, made her vi&s;it
at Etherington, and invited the two &s;i&s;ters to a break|fa&s;t
&s;he was to give the next morning. Mr. Tyrold,
who with &s;urpri&s;e and concern at a coolne&s;s &s;o dilatory,
found a &s;econd day wearing away without a vi&s;it from
Mandlebert, gladly con&s;ented to allow of an amu&s;e|ment,
that might &s;hake from Camilla the pen&s;ivene&s;s
into which, at times, he &s;aw her falling.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery had declared &s;he hated ceremony in
the &s;ummer; guarded, therefore, by Lionel, the
&s;i&s;ters walked to the Grove. From the little hill they
had again to pa&s;s, they ob&s;erved a group of com|pany
upon the leads of her hou&s;e, which were flat,
and balu&s;traded round; and when they pre&s;ented
them&s;elves at the door, they were met by Major Cer|wood,
who conducted them to the &s;cene of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was the end of July, and the weather was &s;ul|try;
but though the height of the place upon which
the pre&s;ent party was collected, gave &s;ome fre&s;hne&s;s
to the air, the heat reflected from the lead would
have been nearly intolerable, had it not been ob|viated
by an awning, and by matts, in the part where
<PB N="310" REF="119">
&s;eats and refre&s;hments were arranged. French horns
and clarinets were played during the repa&s;t.</P>
<P>This little entertainment had for motive a young
lady's quitting her boarding &s;chool. Mi&s;s Dennel,
a niece, by marriage, of Mrs. Arlbery, who, at the
age of fourteen, came to pre&s;ide at the hou&s;e and
table of her father, had begged to be felicitated by
her aunt, upon the joyful occa&s;ion, with a ball: but
Mrs. Arlbery declared &s;he never gave any entertain|ments
in which &s;he did not expect to play the prin|cipal
part her&s;elf; and that balls and concerts were
therefore excluded from her li&s;t of home diver&s;ions.
It was va&s;tly well to &s;ee others &s;hine &s;uperior, &s;he &s;aid,
el&s;ewhere, but &s;he could not be &s;o accommodating as
to perform Nobody under her own roof. She offered
her, however, a breakfa&s;t, with full choice of its
cakes and refre&s;hments; which, with leave to &s;ix
upon the &s;pot where it &s;hould be given, was all the
youthful pleader could obtain.</P>
<P>The Etherington trio met with a reception the
mo&s;t polite, and Camilla was di&s;tingui&s;hed by marks
of peculiar favour. Few gue&s;ts were added to the
party &s;he had met there before, except the young
lady who was its pre&s;ent foundre&s;s; and who&s;e voice
&s;he recollected to have heard, in the enquiries which
had reached her ear from within the paddock.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Dennel was a pretty, blooming, tall girl,
but as childi&s;h in intellect as in experience; though
&s;elf-per&s;uaded &s;he was a woman in both, &s;ince &s;he
was called from &s;chool to fit at the head of her
father's table.</P>
<P>Camilla required nothing further for entertainment
than to li&s;ten to her new friend; Lavinia, though
more amazed than amu&s;ed, always mode&s;tly hung
back as a mere looker on; and the company in ge|neral
made their diver&s;ion from viewing, through
various gla&s;&s;es, the &s;eats of the neighbouring gentle|men,
and re-viewing, with yet more &s;crutiny, their
characters and circum&s;tances. But Lionel, ever re&s;t|le&s;s,
&s;eized the opportunity to patrole the attic re|gions
of the hou&s;e, where, meeting with a capacious
<PB N="311" REF="120">
lumber room, he returned to a&s;&s;ure the whole party
it would make an admirable theatre, and to a&s;k who
would come forth to &s;pout with him.</P>
<P>Mr. Macder&s;ey &s;aid, he did not know one word
of any part, but he could never refu&s;e any thing that
might contribute to the company's plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Away they &s;ped together, and in a few minutes
rever&s;ed the face of every thing. Old &s;ofas, bed|&s;teads,
and trunks, large family che&s;ts, deal boxes
and hampers, carpets and curtains rolled up for the
&s;ummer, tables with two legs, and chairs without
bottoms, were truckled from the middle to one end
of the room, and arranged to form a &s;emi-circle,
with &s;eats in front$$ for a pit. Carpets were then
uncovered and $word$, to be &s;pread for the &s;tage,
and curtains, with as little mercy, were unfurled,
and hung up to make a &s;cene.</P>
<P>They then applied to Mi&s;s Dennel, who had fol|lowed
to peep at what they were about, and a&s;ked
if &s;he thought the audience might be admitted.</P>
<P>She declared &s;he had never &s;een any place &s;o neat
and elegant in her life.</P>
<P>Such an opinion could not but be deci&s;ive; and
they prepared to re-a&s;cend; when the &s;ight of a
&s;mall door, near the entrance of the large apartment,
excited the ever ready curio&s;ity of Lionel, who,
though the key was on the out&s;ide, contrived to turn
it wrong; but while endeavouring to rectify by force
what he had &s;poilt by aukwardne&s;s, a &s;udden noi&s;e
from within &s;tartled them all, and occa&s;ioned quick
and reiterated &s;creams from Mi&s;s Dennel, who, with
the utmo&s;t velocity bur&s;t back upon the company on
the leads, calling out; &startq;O Lord! how glad I am
I'm come back alive! Mr. Macder&s;ey and young
Mr Tyrold are very likely killed! for they've ju&s;t
found I don't know how many robbers &s;hut up in a
dark clo&s;et!&endq;</P>
<P>The gentlemen waited for no explanation to this
unintelligible &s;tory, but ha&s;tened to the &s;pot; and
Mrs. Arlbery ordered all the &s;ervants who were in
waiting to follow and a&s;&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="121">
Mi&s;s Dennel then entreated to have the trap door
through which they a&s;cended, from a &s;mall &s;tair ca&s;e,
to the leads, double locked till the gentlemen &s;hould
declare upon their honours that the thieves were all
dead.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery would not li&s;ten to this, but waited
with Lavinia and Camilla the event.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, meanwhile, reached the &s;cene of
action, at the moment when Macder&s;ey, &s;triking
fir&s;t his foot, and then his whole per&s;on again&s;t the
door, had forced it open with &s;uch &s;udden violence,
that he fell over a pail of water into the adjoining
room.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants arriving at the &s;ame time, announced
that this was merely a clo&s;et for $word$ brooms, and
pails, belonging to the hou&s;e maid: and it appeared,
upon examination, that the noi&s;e from within, had
&s;imply been produced by the falling down of a broom,
occa&s;ioned by their &s;haking the door in endeavouring
to force the lock.</P>
<P>The En&s;ign, wetted or &s;pla&s;hed all over, was in a
fury; and, turning to Lionel, who laughed voci|ferou&s;ly,
whil&s;t the re&s;t of the gentlemen were &s;carce
le&s;s moderate, and the &s;ervants joined in the chorus,
peremptorily demanded to know if he had put the
pail there on purpo&s;e; &startq;In which ca&s;e, Sir,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;you mu&s;t never let me &s;ee you laugh again to
the longe&s;t hour you have to live!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My good Macder&s;ey,&endq; &s;aid the General, &startq;go
into another room, and have your cloaths wiped and
dried; it will be time enough then to &s;ettle who &s;hall
laugh longe&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;General,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I &s;corn to mind being
either wet or dry; a &s;oldier ought to be above &s;uch
delicate effeminacy: it is not, therefore, the &s;ou&s;ing
I regard, provided I can once be clear it was not
done for a joke.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel, when he could &s;peak, declared, that far
from placing the pail there on purpo&s;e, he had not
known there was &s;uch a clo&s;et in the hou&s;e, nor had
<PB N="313" REF="122">
ever been up tho&s;e &s;tairs till they all mounted them
together.</P>
<P>&startq;I am perfectly &s;atisfied, then, my good friend,&endq;
&s;aid the En&s;ign, &s;haking him by the hand with an
heartine&s;s that gave him no &s;mall &s;hare of the pail's
contents; &startq;when a gentleman tells me a thing &s;e|riou&s;ly,
I make it a point to believe him; e&s;pecially
if he has a good hone&s;t countenance, that a&s;&s;ures me
he would not refu&s;e me &s;atisfaction, in the ca&s;e he
had meant to make game of me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And do you always terminate your je&s;ts with
the ceremony of a tilting match?&endq; cried Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Sir! if I'm made a joke of by a man of
any honour. For, to tell you a piece of my mind,
there's no one thing upon earth I hate like a joke;
unle&s;s it's again&s;t another per&s;on; and then it only
gives me a little joy inwardly; for I make it a point
of complai&s;ance not to laugh out: except where I
happen to wi&s;h for a little private conver&s;ation with
the per&s;on that gives me the diver&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Facetious in the extreme!&endq; cried Sir Sedley,
&startq;an infallibly excellent mode to make a man die of
laughter? Droll to the utmo&s;t!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With regard to that, Sir, I have no objection
to a little wit or humour, provided a per&s;on has the
politene&s;s to laugh only at him&s;elf, and his own par|ticular
friends and relations; but if once he takes
the liberty to turn me into ridicule, I look upon it
as an affront, and expect the proper reparation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, to refu&s;e that would be without bowels to a
degree!&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel now ran up &s;tairs, to beg the ladies would
come and &s;ee the theatre; but &s;uddenly exclaimed,
as he looked around, &startq;Ah ha!&endq; and ha&s;tily gal|loped
down, and to the bottom of the hou&s;e. Mrs.
Arlbery de&s;cended with her young party, and the
en&s;ign, in mock heroics, &s;olemnly pro&s;trated him&s;elf
to Mi&s;s Dennel, pouring into her delighted ears,
from various &s;hreds and &s;craps of different tragedies,
the mo&s;t high flown and egregiou&s;ly ill adapted com|pliments:
while the Major, le&s;s ab&s;urdly, though
<PB N="314" REF="123">
&s;carce le&s;s pa&s;&s;ionately, made Camilla his Juliet, and
whi&s;pered the tendere&s;t lines of Romeo.</P>
<P>Lionel pre&s;ently running, out of breath, up &s;tairs
again, cried: &startq;Mrs. Arlbery, I have drawn you
in a new beau.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have you?&endq; cried &s;he, coolly; &startq;why then I
permit you to draw him out again. Had you told
me he had forced him&s;elf in, you had made him
welcome. But I fo&s;ter only willing &s;laves. So off,
if you plea&s;e, with your boa&s;t and your beau.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I can't, upon my word, ma'am, for he is at
my heels.&endq;</P>
<P>Mandlebert, at the &s;ame moment, not hearing
what pa&s;&s;ed, made his appearance.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;ed and always unguarded Camilla, ut|tered
an involuntary exclamation, which in&s;tantly
catching his ear, drew his eye towards the exclaimer,
and there fixed it; with an a&s;toni&s;hment which &s;u&s;|pended
wholly his half made bow, and beginning
addre&s;s to Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>Lionel had de&s;cried him upon the little hill before
the hou&s;e; where, as he was pa&s;&s;ing on, his own at|tention
had been caught by the &s;ound of horns and
clarinets, ju&s;t as, without any explanation, Lionel
flew to tell him he was wanted, and almo&s;t forced
him off his hor&s;e, and up the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, in common with tho&s;e who di&s;pen&s;e
with all forms for them&s;elves, exacted them punc|tiliou&s;ly
from all others. The vi&s;it therefore of Man|dlebert
not being de&s;igned for her, afforded her at
fir&s;t no gratification, and produced rather a contrary
feeling, when &s;he ob&s;erved the total ab&s;ence of all
plea&s;ure in the &s;urpri&s;e with which he met Camilla
at her hou&s;e. She gave him a reception of cold ci|vility,
and then chatted almo&s;t wholly with the Ge|neral,
or Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>Edgar &s;carce &s;aw whether he was received or not;
his bow was mechanical, his apology for his intru|&s;ion
was unintelligible. Amazement at &s;eeing Ca|milla
under this roof, di&s;appointment at her breach
of implied promi&s;e, and mortification at the air of
<PB N="315" REF="124">
being at home, which he thought he remarked in
her &s;ituation, though at an acquaintance he had
taken &s;o much pains to keep aloof from her, all
con&s;pired to di&s;plea&s;e and perplex him; and though
his eyes could with difficulty look any other way, he
neither &s;poke to nor approached her.</P>
<P>Nor was even thus meeting her all he had to give
him di&s;turbance; the palpable devoirs of Major Cer|wood
incen&s;ed as well as a&s;toni&s;hed him; for, under
pretext of only following the humour of the day, in
affecting to act the hero in love, the Major a&s;&s;ailed
her, without re&s;erve, with declarations of his pa&s;|&s;ion,
which though his words pa&s;&s;ed off as quotations,
his looks and manner made appropriate. How, al|ready,
thought Edgar, has he obtained &s;uch a pri|vilege?
&s;uch confidence? To have uttered one &s;uch
&s;entence, my tongue would have trembled, my lips
would have quivered!</P>
<P>Camilla felt confounded by his pre&s;ence, from the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the ill opinion &s;he mu&s;t excite by
this &s;econd apparent di&s;regard of a given engage|ment.
She would fain have explained to him it's
hi&s;tory; but &s;he could not free her&s;elf from the
Major, who&s;e theatrical effu&s;ions were not now to be
repre&s;&s;ed, &s;ince, at fir&s;t, &s;he had unthinkingly at|tended
to them.</P>
<P>Lionel joined with Macder&s;ey in directing &s;imilar
heroics to Mi&s;s Dennel, who, &s;imply enchanted,
called out: &startq;I'm determined when I've a hou&s;e of
my own, I'll have ju&s;t &s;uch a room as this at the
top of it, on purpo&s;e to act a play every night.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And when, my dear,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery,
&startq;do you expect to have a hou&s;e of your own?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, as &s;oon as I am married, you know.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is your marrying, then, already decided?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear no, not that I know of, aunt. I'm &s;ure
I never trouble my&s;elf about it; only I &s;uppo&s;e it
will happen &s;ome day or other.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And when it does, you are very &s;ure your hu&s;|band
will approve your acting plays every night?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="125">
&startq;O, as to that, I &s;han't a&s;k him. Whenever
I'm married I'll be my own mi&s;tre&s;s, that I'm re|&s;olved
upon. But papa's &s;o mon&s;trous cro&s;s, he &s;ays
he won't let me act plays now.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Papas and mamas,&endq; cried Sir Sedley, &startq;are
ever mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly in the way. 'Tis prodigiou&s;ly
&s;urpri&s;ing they have never yet been bani&s;hed &s;ociety. I
know no mark more irrefragable of the &s;upinene&s;s
of mankind.&endq;</P>
<P>Then ri&s;ing, and exclaiming: &startq;What &s;avage
heat! I wi&s;h the weather had a little feeling!&endq; he
broke up the party by ordering his curricle, and
being the fir&s;t to depart.</P>
<P>&startq;That creature,&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;if one
had the lea&s;t care for him, is exactly an animal to
drive one mad! He labours harder to be affected
than any ploughman does for his dinner. And,
completely as his conceit ob&s;cures it, he has every
endowment nature can be&s;tow, except common
&s;en&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>They now all de&s;cended to take leave, except the
En&s;ign and Lionel, who went, arm in arm, prowling
about, to view all the garrets, followed on tip-toe
by Mi&s;s Dennel. Lavinia called vainly after her
brother; but Camilla, hoping every in&s;tant &s;he
might clear her conduct to Edgar, was not &s;orry to
be detained.</P>
<P>They had not, however, been five minutes in the
parlour, before a violent and angry noi&s;e from above,
induced them all to remount to the top of the hou&s;e;
and there, upon entering a garret whence it i&s;&s;ued,
they &s;aw Mi&s;s Dennel, decorated with the En&s;ign's
cocked hat and feather, yet looking pale with fright;
Lionel accoutred in the maid's cloaths, and almo&s;t
in a convul&s;io$ of laughter; and Mac$$r&s;ey, in a
rage utterly incomprehen&s;ible, with the coachman's
large bob-wig $anging loo&s;e upon his head.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before it was po&s;&s;ible to gather,
that having all p$raded into various garrets, in &s;earch
of adventures, Lionel, after attiring him&s;elf in the
maid's gown, cap, and apron, had &s;uddenly depo|&s;ited
<PB N="317" REF="126">
upon Mi&s;s Dennel's head the En&s;ign's cocked
hat, replacing it with the coachman's be&s;t wig upon
the toupee of Macder&s;ey; who&s;e re&s;entment was &s;o
violent at this liberty, that it was &s;till &s;ome minutes
before he could give it articulation.</P>
<P>The effect of this full buckled bob-jerom, which
&s;tuck hollow from the young face and powdered locks
of the En&s;ign, was irre&s;i&s;tibly ludicrous; yet he would
have deemed it a greater indignity to take it quietly
off, than to be viewed in it by thou&s;ands; though
when he &s;aw the di&s;po&s;ition of the whole company $word$
&s;ympathi&s;e with Lionel, his wrath ro&s;e yet higher,
and &s;$amping with pa&s;&s;ion, he fiercely, &s;aid to him&mdash;
&startq;Take it off, Sir!&mdash;take it off my head!&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel, holding this too imperious a command to
be obeyed, only &s;houted louder. Macder&s;ey then,
incen&s;ed beyond endurance, lowered his voice with
&s;tifled choler, and putting his arms akimbo, &s;aid&mdash;
&startq;If you take me for a fool, Sir, I &s;hall demand &s;a|tisfaction;
for it's what I never put up with!&endq;</P>
<P>Then, turning to the re&s;t, he &s;olemnly added&mdash;
&startq;I beg pardon of all the worthy company for &s;peak|ing
this little whi&s;per, which certainly I &s;hould &s;corn
to do before ladies, if it had not been a &s;ecret.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, alarmed at the &s;erious con&s;equences
now threatening this folly, &s;aid&mdash;&startq;No, no; I allow
of no &s;ecrets in my hou&s;e, but what are entru&s;ted to
my&s;elf. I in&s;i&s;t, therefore, upon being umpire in
this cau&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Madam,&endq; &s;aid Macder&s;ey, &startq;I hope never to
become &s;uch a deba&s;ed brute of the creation, as to
contradict the commands of a fair lady&punc; except when
it's upon a point of honour. But I can't con&s;ent to
pa&s;s for a fool; and &s;till more not for a poltroon&mdash;
You'll excu&s;e the little hint.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, while making a profound and ceremonious
bow, his wig fell over his head on the ground.</P>
<P>&startq;This is very unlucky,&endq; cried he, with a look of
vexation; &startq;for certainly, and to be &s;ure no human
mortal &s;hould have made me take it off my&s;elf, before
I was righted.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="127">
Camilla, picking it up, to render the affair merely
burle&s;que, pulled off the maid's cap from her bro|ther's
head, and put on the wig in its place, &s;aying
&mdash;&startq;There, Lionel, you have played the part of
<HI>Lady Wrong Head</HI> long enough; be &s;o good now as
to perform that of <HI>Sir Francis.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>This ended the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the whole party, in
curricles, on hor&s;eback, or on foot, departed from
the Grove.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="36" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A few Explanations.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t words of Dr. Marchmont, in taking
leave of Edgar, were injunctions to circum&s;pection,
and repre&s;entations of the difficulty of drawing back
with honour, if once any incautious eagerne&s;s be|trayed
his partiality. To this coun&s;el he was im|pelled
to &s;ubmit, le&s;t he &s;hould ri&s;k for Camilla a re|port
&s;imilar to that which for Indiana had given him
&s;o much di&s;turbance. There, indeed, he felt him|&s;elf
wholly blamele&s;s. His admiration was but &s;uch
as he always experienced at &s;ight of a beautiful pic|ture,
nor had it ever been demon&s;trated in any more
&s;erious manner. He had di&s;tingui&s;hed her by no par|ticular
attention, &s;ingled her out by no pointed ad|dre&s;s,
taken no pains to engage her good opinion,
and manife&s;ted no flattering plea&s;ure at her approach
or pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>His &s;en&s;e of right was too ju&s;t to mi&s;lead him into
giving him&s;elf &s;imilar ab&s;olution with re&s;pect to Ca|milla.
He had never, indeed, indulged a voluntary
vent to his preference; but the candour of his cha|racter
convinced him that what &s;o forcibly he had
felt, he mu&s;t occa&s;ionally have betrayed. Yet the
idea excited regret without remor&s;e; for though it
had been his wi&s;h, as well as intention, to conceal
<PB N="319" REF="128">
his be&s;t hopes, till they were ratified by his judg|ment,
he had the con&s;cious integrity of knowing
that, &s;hould her heart become his prize, his deare&s;t
view in life would be to &s;olicit her hand.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve, therefore, the appearance of an un|de&s;igning
friend of the hou&s;e, he had forced him&s;elf
to refrain, for two days, from any vi&s;it to the rec|tory,
whither he was repairing, when thus, un|looked
and unwi&s;hed for, he &s;urprized Camilla at the
Grove.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed and di&s;approving feelings kept him,
while there, aloof from her; by continual &s;ugge&s;|tions,
that her charact$r was of no &s;tability, that
Dr. Marchmont was right in his doubts, and Mi&s;s
Margland her&s;elf not wrong in accu&s;ing her of ca|price;
and when he perceived, upon her preparing
to walk home with her brother and &s;i&s;ter, that Ma|jor
Cerwood &s;tept forward to attend her, he indig|nantly
re&s;olved to arrange without delay his conti|nental
excur&s;ion. But again, when, as &s;he quitted
the room, he &s;aw he$ head half turned round, with
an eye of enquiry if he followed, he determined
frankly, and at on$ $word$ in his capacity of a friend, to
reque&s;t &s;ome explan$$ion of this meeting.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;iduities o$ the Major made it difficult to
&s;peak to her; but t$$ aid of her de&s;ire for a conver|&s;ation,
which was equally anxious, and le&s;s guarded
than his own, anticipated his principal inve&s;tigation,
by urging her, voluntarily to &s;eize an opportunity
of relating to him the hi&s;tory of her fir&s;t vi&s;it to
Mrs. Arlbery; and of a&s;&s;uring him that the &s;econd
was indi&s;pen&s;ably its con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Softened by this apparent earne&s;tne&s;s for his good
opinion, all his intere&s;t and all his tenderne&s;s for her
returned; and though much chagrined at the acci|dent,
or rather mi&s;chief, which had thus e&s;tabli&s;hed
the acquaintance, he had too little to &s;ay, whatever
he had to feel, of po&s;itive weight again&s;t it, to pro|po&s;e
its now being relinqui&s;hed. He thanked her
impre&s;&s;ively for &s;o ready an explanation; and then
gently added; &startq;I know your predilection in favour
<PB N="320" REF="129">
of this lady, and I will &s;ay nothing to di&s;turb it;
but as &s;he is yet new to you, and as all re&s;idence, all
intercour&s;e, from your own home or relations, is new
to you al&s;o&mdash;tell me, candidly, &s;incerely tell me, can
you conde&s;cend to &s;uffer an old friend, though in the
per&s;on of but a young man, to offer you, from time
to time, a hint, a little coun&s;el, a few brief words
of occa&s;ional advice? and even, perhaps, now and
then, to torment you into a little &s;erious reflec|tion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you,&endq; cried &s;he, gaily, &startq;will give me the
reflection, I promi&s;e, to the be&s;t of my power, to
give you in return, the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s; but I can by no
means engage for both!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, never, but from your own prudence,&endq; he
an&s;wered, gratefully, &startq;may your delightful vivacity
know a curb! If now I &s;eem my&s;elf to fear it, it is
not from moro&s;ene&s;s, it is not from in&s;en&s;ibility to
its charm&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>He was &s;topt here by Macder&s;ey, who, &s;uddenly
overtaking him, entreated an immediate &s;hort con|ference
upon a matter of moment.</P>
<P>Though cruelly vexed by the interruption, he
could not refu&s;e to turn back with him; and Ca|milla
again was left wholly to the gallant Major; but
her heart felt &s;o light that &s;he had thus cleared her|&s;elf
to Edgar, &s;o gratified by his reque&s;t to become
him&s;elf her monitor, and &s;o enchanted to find her
acquaintance with Mrs. Arlbery no longer di&s;puted,
that &s;he was too happy to admit any vexation; and
the Major had never thought her &s;o charming, though
of the Major &s;he thought not one moment.</P>
<P>Macder&s;ey, with a long, ceremonious, and not
very clear apology, confe&s;&s;ed he had called Mandle|bert
a&s;ide only to enquire into the certain truth, if it
were not a po&s;itive &s;ecret, of his intended nuptials
with the beautiful Mi&s;s Lynmere. Mandlebert,
with &s;urprize, but without any he&s;itation, declared
him&s;elf wholly without any preten&s;ions to that lady.
Macder&s;ey then embraced him, and they parted mu|tually
&s;atisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="130">
It &s;eemed now too late to Mandlebert to go to
Etherington till the next day, whither, as &s;oon as
he had breakfa&s;ted, he then rode.</P>
<P>According to his general cu&s;tom, he went imme|diately
to the &s;tudy, where he met with a calm, but
kind reception from Mr. Tyrold; and after half an
hour's conver&s;ation, upon Li&s;bon, Dr. Marchmont,
and Mrs. Tyrold, he left him to &s;eek his young
friends.</P>
<P>In the parlour, he found Lavinia alone; but be|fore
he could enquire for her &s;i&s;ter, who was acciden|tally
up &s;tairs, Lionel, ju&s;t di&s;mounted from his
hor&s;e, appeared.</P>
<P>&startq;O, ho, Edgar!&endq; cried he, &startq;you are here, are
you? this would make fine confu&s;ion, if that beauty
of nature, Mi&s;s Margland, &s;hould happen to call.
They've ju&s;t &s;ent for you to Beech Park. I don't
know what's to be done to you; but if you have
any inclination to &s;ave poor Camilla's eyes, or cap, at
lea&s;t, from that meek, tender creature, you'll &s;et off
for Cleves before they know you are in this hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar amazed, de&s;ired an explanation; but he
prote&s;ted the wrath of Mi&s;s Margland had been &s;o
comical, and given him&punc; &s;o much diver&s;ion, that he
had not been able to get at any particulars; he only
knew there was a great commotion, and that Edgar
was declared in love with &s;ome of his &s;i&s;ters or cou|&s;ins,
and Mi&s;s Margland was in a rage that it was
not with her&s;elf; and that, in &s;hort, becau&s;e he
only happened to drop a hint of the latter notion,
that delectable paragon had given him &s;o violent a
blow with her fine eyes, that in order to vent an un|governable
&s;it of laughter, without the ri&s;k of having
the hou&s;e pulled about his ears, he had ha&s;tily
mounted his hor&s;e, and galloped off.</P>
<P>The contempt of Edgar for Mi&s;s Margland would
have made him di&s;dain another que&s;tion, if the
name of Camilla had not been mingled in this rela|tion;
no que&s;tion, however, could procure further
information. Lionel, enchanted that he had tor|mented
Mi&s;s Margland, under&s;tood nothing more of
<PB N="322" REF="131">
the matter, and could only repeat his own merry
&s;ayings, and their effect.</P>
<P>Lavinia expre&s;&s;ed, mo&s;t innocently, her curio&s;ity
to know what this meant; and was going for Ca|milla,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;ome conjecture; but Edgar, who
by this &s;trange &s;tory had lo&s;t his compo&s;ure, felt un|equal
to hearing it di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in her pre&s;ence, and,
pleading &s;udden ha&s;te, rode away.</P>
<P>He did not, however, go to Cleves; he hardly
knew if Lionel had not amu&s;ed him with a feigned
&s;tory; but he no &s;ooner arrived at Beech Park, than
he found a me&s;&s;age from Sir Hugh, begging to &s;ee
him with all &s;peed.</P>
<P>The young En&s;ign was the cau&s;e of this pre&s;ent
&s;ummons and di&s;turbance. Elated by the declara|tion
of Mandlebert, that the rumour of his contract
was void of foundation, and buoyed up by Mrs.
Arlbery, to whom he returned with the communica|tion,
he re&s;olved to make his advances in form. He
pre&s;ented him&s;elf, therefore, at Cleves, where he
a&s;ked an audience of Sir Hugh, and at once, with
his accu&s;tomed vehemence, declared him&s;elf bound
eternally, life and &s;oul, to his fair niece, Mi&s;s Lyn|mere;
and de&s;ired that, in order to pay his addre&s;&s;es
to her, he might be permitted to &s;ee her at odd
times, when he was off duty.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was &s;carce able to under&s;tand him, from
his volubility, and the extravagance of his phra&s;es
and ge&s;tures; but he imputed them to his violent
pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore an&s;wered him with great gen|tlene&s;s,
a&s;&s;uring him he did not mean to doubt his
being a proper alliance for his niece, though he had
never heard of him before; but begging he would
not be affronted if he could not accept him, not
knowing yet quite clearly if &s;he were not engaged to
a young gentleman in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The En&s;ign now loudly proclaimed his own news:
Mandlebert had prote&s;ted him&s;elf free, and the
whole county already rang with the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who always at a lo&s;s how to &s;ay no,
thought this would have been a good an&s;wer, now
<PB N="323" REF="132">
&s;ent for Mi&s;s Margland, and de&s;ired her to &s;peak
her&s;elf with the young gentleman.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, much gratified, a&s;ked Macder&s;ey
if &s;he could look at his rent roll.</P>
<P>He had nothing of the kind at hand, he &s;aid, not
being yet come to his e&s;tate, which was in Ireland,
and was &s;till the property of a fir&s;t cou&s;in, who was
not yet dead.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, promi&s;ing he &s;hould have an an|&s;wer
in a few days, then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him; but more
irritated than ever again&s;t Mandlebert, from the con|tra&s;t
of his power to make &s;ettlements, &s;he bur&s;t
forth into her old declarations of his ill u&s;age of
Mi&s;s Lynmere; attributing it wholly to the contriv|ances
of Camilla, whom &s;he had her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid,
&s;urprized wheedling Edgar into her &s;nares, when
&s;he called la&s;t at Etherington; and who, &s;he doubt|ed
not, they &s;hould &s;oon hear was going to be mar|ried
to him.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh always under&s;tood literally whatever
was &s;aid; the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions therefore of ill humour,
merely made to vent black bile, affected him deeply
for the honour and welfare of Camilla, and he ha&s;tily
&s;ent a me&s;&s;enger for Edgar, determining to beg, if
that were the c$&s;e, he would openly own the whole,
and not leave all the blame to fall all upon his poor
niece.</P>
<P>At this period, Lionel had called, and, by in|flaming
Mi&s;s Margland, had aggravated the general
di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>When Edgar arrived, Sir Hugh told him of the
affair, a&s;&s;uring him he &s;hould never have taken ami&s;s
his preferring Camilla, which he thought but natu|ral,
if he had only done it from the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Edgar, though ea&s;ily through all this he &s;aw the
malignant yet &s;hallow offices of Mi&s;s Margland,
found him&s;elf, with infinite vexation, compelled to
declare off equally from both the charges; con&s;ci|ous,
that till the very moment of his propo&s;als, he
mu&s;t appear to have no preference nor de&s;igns. He
&s;poke, therefore, with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect of the
<PB N="324" REF="133">
young ladies, but again &s;aid it was uncertain if he
&s;hould not travel before he formed any e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s thus explicitly decided, nothing more
could be done: but Mi&s;s Margland was &s;omewhat
appea&s;ed, when &s;he heard that her pupil was not &s;o
di&s;gracefully to be &s;upplanted.</P>
<P>Indiana her&s;elf, to whom Edgar had never &s;eemed
agreeable, &s;oon forgot &s;he had ever thought of him;
and elated by the acqui&s;ition of a new lover, doubted
not, but, in a &s;hort time, the publication of her li|berty
would prove &s;lavery to all mankind.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, the carriage of Sir Hugh
arrived at the rectory for Camilla. She never re|fu&s;ed
an invitation from her uncle, but &s;he felt &s;o
little equal to pa&s;&s;ing a whole day in the pre&s;ence of
Mi&s;s Margland, after the unaccountable, yet alarm|ing
relation &s;he had gathered from Lionel, that &s;he
entreated him to accompany her, and to manage that
&s;he &s;hould return with him as &s;oon as the hor&s;es were
fed and re&s;ted.</P>
<P>Lionel, ever good humoured, and ready to oblige,
willingly complied; but demanded that &s;he &s;hould
go with him, in their way back, to &s;ee a new hou&s;e
which he wanted to examine.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh received her with his u&s;ual affection, In|diana
with indifference, and Mi&s;s Margland with a
malicious &s;mile: but Eugenia, &s;oon taking her a&s;ide,
di&s;clo&s;ed to her that Edgar, the day before, had
publicly and openly di&s;claimed any views upon In|diana,
and had declared him&s;elf without any pa&s;&s;ion
whatever, and free from all inclination or intention
but to travel.</P>
<P>The blu&s;h of plea&s;ure, with which Camilla heard
the fir&s;t &s;entence of this &s;peech, became the tingle of
&s;hame at the &s;econd, and whitened into &s;urpri&s;e and
&s;orrow at the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Eugenia, though &s;he &s;aw &s;ome di&s;turbance, under|&s;tood
not the&s;e changes. Early ab&s;orbed in the &s;tudy
of literature and languages, under the direction of a
preceptor who had never mingled with the world,
her capacity had been occupied in con&s;tant work for
<PB N="325" REF="134">
her memory; but her judgment and penetration had
been wholly unexerci&s;ed. Like her uncle, &s;he con|cluded
every body, and every thing to be preci&s;ely
what they appeared; and though, in that given point
of view, &s;he had keener intellects to di&s;cern, and
more &s;kill to appreciate per&s;ons and characters, &s;he
was as unpracti&s;ed as him&s;elf in tho&s;e di&s;criminative
powers, which dive into their own conceptions to
di&s;cover the latent &s;prings, the multifarious and con|tradictory
&s;ources of human actions and propen&s;ities.</P>
<P>Upon their return to the company, Mi&s;s Margland
cho&s;e to relate the hi&s;tory her&s;elf. Mr. Mandlebert,
&s;he &s;aid, had not only thought proper to acknow|ledge
his utter in&s;en&s;ibility to Mi&s;s Lynmere, but
had declared his indifference for every woman under
the &s;un, and prote&s;ted he held them all cheap alike.
&startq;So I would advi&s;e nobody,&endq; &s;he continued, &startq;to
flatter them&s;elves with making a conque&s;t of him,
for they may take my word for it, he won't be caught
very ea&s;ily.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla di&s;dained to under&s;tand this but in a ge|neral
&s;en&s;e, and made no an&s;wer. Indiana, pouting
her lip, &s;aid &s;he was &s;ure &s;he did not want to catch
him: &s;he did not fear having offers enough without
him, if &s;he &s;hould happen to chu&s;e to marry.</P>
<P>&startq;Certainly,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;there's no
doubt of that;&endq; and this young officer's coming the
very moment he heard of your being at liberty, is a
proof that the only rea&s;on of your having had no
more propo&s;als, is owing to Mr. Mandlebert. So I
don't &s;peak for you, but for any body el&s;e, that may
&s;uppo&s;e they may plea&s;e the difficult gentleman
better.</P>
<P>Camilla now breathed hard with re&s;entment; but
&s;till was &s;ilent, and Indiana an&s;wering only for her|&s;elf,
&s;aid: &startq;O, yes! I can't &s;ay I'm much fright|ened.
I dare &s;ay if Mr. Melmond had known, . . .
but he thought like every body el&s;e . . . however,
I'm &s;ure, I'm very glad of it, only I wi&s;h he had
&s;poke a little &s;ooner, for I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Melmond
thinks me as much out of his reach as if I was mar|ried
<PB N="326" REF="135">
Not that I care about it; only it's provok|ing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, my dear,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;it would
be quite below your dignity to think about him, with|out
knowing better who he is, or what are his ex|pectations
and connexions. As to this young officer,
I &s;hall take proper care to make enquiries, before he
has his an&s;wer. He belongs to a very good family;
for he's related to Lord O'Lerney, and I have friends
in Ireland who can acquaint me with his &s;ituation and
fortune. There's time enough to look about you;
only as Mr. Mandlebert has behaved &s;o unhand|&s;omely,
I hope none of the family will give him their
countenance. I am &s;ure it will be to no purpo&s;e, if
any body &s;hould think of doing it by way of having
any de&s;ign upon him. It will be lo&s;t labour, I can
tell them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to that, I am quite ea&s;y,&endq; &s;aid Indiana,
to&s;&s;ing her head, &startq;any body is welcome to him for
me;&mdash;my cou&s;in, or any body el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, now, ab&s;olutely called upon to &s;peak,
with all the &s;pirit &s;he could a&s;&s;ume, &s;aid, &startq;With
regard to me, there is no occa&s;ion to remind me how
much I am out of the que&s;tion; yet &s;uffer me to &s;ay,
re&s;pect for my&s;elf would &s;ecure me from forming &s;uch
plans as you &s;urmi&s;e, if no other &s;en&s;e of propriety
could &s;ave me from &s;uch humiliation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Now, my dear, you &s;peak properly,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s
Margland, taking her hand; &startq;and I hope you will
have the &s;pirit to &s;hew him you care no more for him
than he cares for you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I hope &s;o too,&endq; an&s;wered Camilla, turning pale;
&startq;but I don't &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;I can't imagine&mdash;that it is
very likely he &s;hould have mentioned any thing good
or bad&mdash;with regard to his care for me?&endq;</P>
<P>This was painfully uttered, but from a curio&s;ity
irrepre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>&startq;As to that, my dear, don't deceive your&s;elf;
for the que&s;tion was put home to him very properly,
th$$ you might know what you had to expect, and
not keep off other engagements from a fal&s;e notion.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="136">
&startq;This indeed,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, colouring with in|dignation,
&startq;this has been a mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s, a mo&s;t
cau&s;ele&s;s enquiry!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am very glad you treat the matter as it de|&s;erves,
for I like to &s;ee young ladies behave with
dignity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And pray, then, what&mdash;was there any&mdash;did he
make&mdash;was there any&mdash;any an&s;wer&mdash;to this&mdash;to&mdash;.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, yes, he an&s;wered without any great cere|mony,
I can a&s;&s;ure you! He &s;aid, in &s;o many words,
that he thought no more of you than of your cou&s;in,
and was going abroad to divert and amu&s;e him&s;elf,
better than by entering into marriage with either one
or other of you; or with any body el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla felt half killed by this an&s;wer; and pre|&s;ently
quitting the room, ran out into the garden,
and to a walk far from the hou&s;e, before &s;he had
power to breathe, or recollection to be aware of the
&s;en&s;ibility &s;he was betraying.</P>
<P>She then as ha&s;tily went back, &s;ecretly re&s;olving
never more to think of him, and to &s;hew both to
him&s;elf and to the world, by every means in her power,
her perfect indifference.</P>
<P>She could not, however, endure to encounter Mi&s;s
Margland again, but called for Lionel, and begged
him to hurry the coachman.</P>
<P>Lionel complied&mdash;&s;he took a ha&s;ty leave of her
uncle, and only &s;aying, &startq;Good by, good by!&endq; to
the re&s;t, made her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, ever un&s;u&s;picious, thought her merely
afraid to detain her brother; but Eugenia, calm, af|fectionate,
and dive&s;ted of cares for her&s;elf, &s;aw evi|dently
that &s;omething was wrong, though &s;he divined
not what, and entreated leave to go with her &s;i&s;ter to
Etherington, and thence to return, without keeping
out the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was well plea&s;ed, and the two &s;i&s;ters and
Lionel &s;et off together.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Specimens of Ta&s;te.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ence of Lionel &s;tifled the enquiries of
Eugenia; and pride, all up in arms, ab&s;orbed every
&s;ofter feeling in Camilla.</P>
<P>When they had driven half a mile, &startq;Now, young
ladies,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I &s;hall treat you with a frolic.&endq;
He then &s;topt the carriage, and told the coachman
to drive to Cornfield; &s;aying, &startq;Tis but two miles
about, and Coachy won't mind that; will you
Coachy?&endq;</P>
<P>The coachman, looking forward to half a crown,
&s;aid his hor&s;es would be all the better for a little
more exerci&s;e; and Jacob, familiarly fond of Lionel
from a boy, made no difficulty.</P>
<P>Lionel de&s;ired his &s;i&s;ters to a&s;k no que&s;tions, a&s;&s;ur|ing
them he had great de&s;igns, and a mo&s;t agreeable
&s;urpri&s;e in view for them.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of his directions, they drove on till
they came before a &s;mall hou&s;e, ju&s;t new fronted with
deep red bricks, containing, on the ground floor, two
little bow windows, in a &s;harp triangular form, en|clo&s;ing
a door ornamented with &s;mall panes of gla&s;s,
cut in various &s;hapes; on the fir&s;t &s;tory, a little bal|cony,
decorated in the middle and at each corner
with leaden images of Cupids; and, in the attic
&s;tory, a very &s;mall venetian window, partly formed
with minute panes of gla&s;s, and partly with glazed
tiles; repre&s;enting, in blue and white, various de|vices
of dogs and cats, mice and birds, rats and fer|rets,
as emblems of the conjugal &s;tate.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, young ladies, what &s;ay you to this?&endq;
cried he, &startq;does it hit your fancy? If it does, 'tis
your own!&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia a&s;ked what he meant.</P>
<P>&startq;Mean? to make a pre&s;ent of it to which ever is
the be&s;t girl, and can fir&s;t cry bo! to a goo&s;e. Come,
<PB N="329" REF="138">
don't look di&s;dainfully. Eugenia, what &s;ay you?
won't it be better to be mi&s;tre&s;s of this little neat,
tight, &s;nug box, and a pretty little tidy hu&s;band,
that belongs to it, than to pore all day long over a
latin theme with old Dr. Orkborne? I have often
thought my poor uncle was certainly out of his wits,
when he &s;et us all, men, women, and children, to
learn Latin, or el&s;e be whipt by the old doctor. But
we all &s;oon got our necks out of the collar, except
poor Eugenia, and &s;he's had to work for us all.
However, here's an opportunity&mdash;&s;ee but what a
pretty place&mdash;not quite fini&s;hed, to be &s;ure, but
look at that lake? how cool, how rural, how re|fre&s;hing!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lake?&endq; repeated Eugenia, &startq;I &s;ee nothing but
a very dirty little pond, with a ma&s;s of rubbi&s;h in
the middle. Indeed I &s;ee nothing el&s;e but rubbi&s;h
all round, and every where.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That's the very beauty of the thing, my dear;
it's all in the exact &s;tate for being fini&s;hed under your
own eye, and according to your own ta&s;te.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To whom does it belong?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It's uninhabited yet; but it's preparing for a
very &s;pruce young &s;park, that I advi&s;e you both to
&s;et your caps at. Hold! I &s;ee &s;omebody peeping;
I'll go and get &s;ome news for you.&endq;</P>
<P>He then jumped from the coach, and ran up five
deep narrow &s;teps, formed of &s;ingle large rough &s;tones,
which mounted &s;o much above the thre&s;hold of the
hou&s;e, that upon opening the door, there appeared
a &s;tool to a&s;&s;i&s;t all comers to reach the floor of the
pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with &s;ome curio&s;ity, looked out, and
&s;aw her brother, after nearly forcing his entrance,
&s;peak to a very mean little man, dre&s;&s;ed in old dirty
cloaths, who &s;eemed willing to hide him&s;elf behind
the door, but whom he almo&s;t dragged forward, &s;ay|ing
aloud, &startq;O, I can take no excu&s;e, I in&s;i&s;t upon
your &s;hewing the hou&s;e. I have brought two young
ladies on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it; and who knows but one
<PB N="330" REF="139">
of them may take a fancy to it, and make you a
happy man for life.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to that, Sir,&endq; &s;aid the man, &s;till endeavour|ing
to retreat, &startq;I can't &s;ay as I've quite made my
mind up yet as to the marriage ceremony. I've
known partly enough of the &s;tate already; but if
ever I marry again, which is a moot point, I &s;ha'n't
do it hand over head, like a boy, without knowing
what I'm about. However, it's time enough o'con|&s;cience
to think of that, when my hou&s;e is done, and
my workmen is off my hands.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now, by the language and the voice, ga|thered
that this was Mr. Dub&s;ter.</P>
<P>&startq;Pho, pho,&endq; an&s;wered Lionel, &startq;you mu&s;t not
he &s;o hard-hearted when fair ladies are in the ca&s;e.
Be&s;ides, one of them is that pretty girl you flirted
with at Northwick. She's a &s;i&s;ter of mine, and I
&s;hall take it very ill if you don't hand her out of the
coach, and do the honours of your place to her.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, much provoked, earne&s;tly called to her
brother, but utterly in vain.</P>
<P>&startq;Lauk-a-day! why it is not half fini&s;hed,&endq; &s;aid
Mr. Dub&s;ter; &startq;nor a quarter neither: and as to
that young lady, I can't &s;ay as it was much in my
mind to be over civil to her any more, begging par|don,
after her giving me the &s;lip in that manner.
I can't &s;ay as I think it was over and above hand&s;ome,
letting me get my gloves. Not that I mind it in
the lea&s;t, as to that.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pho, pho, man, you mu&s;t never bear malice
again&s;t a fair lady. Be&s;ides, &s;he's come now on pur|po&s;e
to make her excu&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, that's another thing; if the young lady's
&s;orry, I &s;ha'n't think of holding out. Be&s;ides, I
can't &s;ay but what I thought her agreeable enough,
if it had not been for her behaving &s;o comical ju&s;t
at the la&s;t. Not that I mean in the lea&s;t to make
any complaint, by way of getting of the young lady
&s;colded.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You mu&s;t make friends now, man, and think
no more of it;&endq; cried Lionel, who would have drawn
<PB N="331" REF="140">
him to the carriage; but he prote&s;ted he was quite
a&s;hamed to be &s;een in &s;uch a di&s;abille, and &s;hould go
fir&s;t and dre&s;s him&s;elf. Lionel, on the contrary, de|claring
nothing &s;o manly, nor &s;o becoming, as a ne|glect
of outward appearance, pulled him to the
coach door, notwith&s;tanding all his efforts to di&s;en|gage
him&s;elf, and the mo&s;t ba&s;hful di&s;tortions with
which he &s;trove to &s;neak behind his conductor.</P>
<P>&startq;Ladies,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;Mr. Dub&s;ter de&s;ires to have
the honour of walking over his hou&s;e and grounds
with you.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla declared &s;he had no time to alight; but
Lionel in&s;i&s;ted, and &s;oon forced them both from the
coach.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter, no longer &s;tiff, &s;tarched, and proud,
as when full dre&s;&s;ed, was &s;unk into the &s;malle&s;t in|&s;ignificance;
and when they were compelled to enter
his grounds, through a &s;mall Chine&s;e gate, painted
of a deep blue, would entirely have kept out of
&s;ight; but for a whi&s;per from Lionel, that the ladies
had owned they thought he looked to particular ad|vantage
in that carele&s;s attire.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this, he came boldly forward, and
&s;uddenly facing them, made a low bow &s;aying:
&startq;Young ladies, your humble.&endq;</P>
<P>They court&s;ied &s;lightly, and Camilla &s;aid &s;he was
very &s;orry to break in upon him.</P>
<P>&startq;O, it don't much matter,&endq; cried he, extremely
plea&s;ed by this civility, &startq;I only hope, young ladies,
you won't take umbrage at my receiving you in this
pickle; but you've popt upon me unawares, as one
may &s;ay. And my be&s;t coat is at this very minute at
Tom Hicks's, nicely packed and papered up, and tied
all round, in a drawer of his, up &s;tairs in his room.
And I'd have gone for it with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure
in life, to &s;hew my re&s;pect, if the young gentleman
would have let me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And then,&endq; recollecting Eugenia, &startq;Good lauk,
ma'am,&endq; &s;aid he, in a low voice to Camilla, &startq;that's
that &s;ame lame little lady as I &s;aw at the ball?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="141">
&startq;That lady, Sir,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, provoked, &startq;is
my &s;i&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mercy's me!&endq; exclaimed he, lifting up his
hands, &startq;I wi&s;h I'd known as much at the time.
I'm &s;ure, ma'am, if I'd thought the young lady
was any ways related to you, I would not have &s;aid
a word di&s;re&s;pectful upon no account.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel a&s;ked how long he had had this place.</P>
<P>&startq;Only a little while. I happened of it quite
lucky. A friend of mine was ju&s;t being turned out
of it, in default of payment, and &s;o I got it a bar|gain.
I intend to fit it up a little in ta&s;te, and then,
whether I like it or no, I can always let it.&endq;</P>
<P>They were now, by Lionel, dragged into the
hou&s;e, which was yet unfurni&s;hed, half papered, and
half white wa&s;hed. The workmen, Mr. Dub&s;ter
&s;aid, were ju&s;t gone to dinner, and he rejoiced that
they had happened to come &s;o conveniently, when
he &s;hould be no lo&s;er by leaving $he m$n to them|&s;elves,
in order to oblige the young ladies with his
company.</P>
<P>He in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;hewing them not only every
room, but every clo&s;et, every cupboard, every $ook,
corner, and hiding place; prai&s;ing their utility, and
enumerating all their po&s;&s;ible appropriations, with
the mo&s;t minute encomiums.</P>
<P>&startq;But I'm quite &s;orry,&endq; cried he, &startq;young ladies,
to think as I've nothing to offer you. I eats my
dinner at the Globe, having nobody here to cook.
However I'd have had a mor&s;el of cake or &s;o, if the
young gentleman had been &s;o kind as to give me an
item before-hand of your intending me the favour.
But as to getting things into the hou&s;e hap hazard,
really every thing is &s;o dear&mdash;it's quite out of rea|&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;campering of hor&s;es now carrying them to a
window, they &s;aw &s;ome hounds in full cry, followed
by hor&s;e-men in full gallop. Lionel declared he
would borrow Jacob's mare, and join them, while
his &s;i&s;ters walked about the grounds: but Camilla,
taking him a&s;ide, made a &s;erious expo&s;tulation, pro|te&s;ting
<PB N="333" REF="142">
that her father, with all his indulgence, and
even her uncle him&s;elf, would be certainly di&s;plea&s;ed,
if he left them alone with this man; of whom they
knew nothing but his very low trade.</P>
<P>&startq;Why what is his trade?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A tinker's: Mrs. Arlbery told me &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>He laughed violently at this information, prote&s;t|ing
he was rejoiced to find &s;o much money could be
made by the tinkering bu&s;ine&s;s, which he was deter|mined
to follow in his next di&s;tre&s;s for ca&s;h: yet
added, he feared this was only the malice of Mrs.
Arlbery, for Dub&s;ter, he had been told, had kept a
&s;hop for ready made wigs.</P>
<P>He gave up, however, his project, forgetting the
chace when he no longer heard the hounds, and de|&s;ired
Mr. Dub&s;ter to proceed in &s;hewing his lions.</P>
<P>&startq;Lauk a day! Sir, I've got no lions, nor tygers
neither. It's a deal of expence keeping them ani|mals;
and though I know they reckon me near, I
&s;ha'n't do no &s;uch thing; for if a man does not take
a little care of his money when once he has got it,
e&s;pecially if it's hone&s;tly, I thing he's a fool for his
pains; begging pardon for &s;peaking my mind &s;o
freely.&endq;</P>
<P>He then led them again to the front of the hou&s;e,
where he de&s;ired they would look at his pond.
&startq;This,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;is what I value the mo&s;t of all,
except my &s;ummer hou&s;e and my labyrinth. I &s;hall
&s;tock it well; and many a good dinner I hope to eat
from it. It gets me an appetite, &s;ometimes, I think,
only to look at it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;'Tis a beautiful piece of water,&endq; &s;aid Lionel,
&startq;and may be u&s;eful to the out&s;ide as well as the in|&s;ide,
for, if you go in head foremo&s;t, you may bathe
as well as feed from it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, I &s;ha'n't do that, Sir, I'm not over and
above fond of water at be&s;t. However I &s;hall have
a &s;wan.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A &s;wan? why &s;ure you won't be contented with
only one?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="143">
&startq;O yes, I &s;hall. It will only be made of wood,
painted over in white. There's no end of feeding
them things if one has 'em alive. Be&s;ides it will
look ju&s;t as pretty; and won't bite. And I know
a friend of mine that one of them creatures flew at,
and gave him &s;uch a bang as almo&s;t broke his leg,
only for throwing a &s;tone at it, out of mere play.
They are mortal &s;piteful, if you happen to hurt
them when you're in their reach.&endq;</P>
<P>He then begged them to go over to his i&s;land,
which proved to be what Eugenia had taken for a
ma&s;s of rubbi&s;h. They would fain have been ex|cu&s;ed
cro&s;&s;ing a plank which he called a bridge, but
Lionel would not be denied</P>
<P>&startq;Now here,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;when my i&s;land's fini&s;hed,
I &s;hall have &s;omething the&s;e young ladies will like;
and that's a lamb.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alive, or dead?&endq; cried Lionel.</P>
<P>&startq;Alive,&endq; he replied, &startq;for I &s;hall have good pa&s;|ture
in a little bit of ground ju&s;t by,&endq; where I &s;hall
keep me a cow; and here will be gra&s;s enough upon
my i&s;land to keep it from &s;tarving on Sundays, and
for now and then, when I've &s;omebody come to &s;ee
me. And when it's fit for killing, I can change it
with the farmer down the lane, for another young
one, by a bargain I've agreed with him for already;
for I don't love to run no ri&s;ks about a thing for mere
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>&startq;Your place will be quite a paradi&s;e,&endq; &s;aid
Lionel.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, indeed, Sir, I think I've earned having
a little recreeting, for I worked hard enough for it,
before I happened of meeting with my fir&s;t wife.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, ho! &s;o you began with marrying a for|tune?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Sir, and very pretty &s;he was too, if &s;he
had not been &s;o puny. But &s;he was always ailing.
She co&s;t me a mort of money to the potecary before
&s;he went off. And &s;he was a tedious while a dying,
poor &s;oul!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="144">
&startq;Your fir&s;t wife? &s;urely you have not been twice
married already?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, I have. My &s;econd wife brought me a
very pretty fortune too. I can't &s;ay but I've rather
had the luck of it, as far as I've gone yet awhile.&endq;</P>
<P>They now repa&s;&s;ed the plank, and were conducted
to an angle, in which a bench was placed clo&s;e to the
chine&s;e rails, which was &s;omewhat &s;haded by a wil|low,
that grew in a little piece of &s;tagnant water on
the other &s;ide. A &s;yringa was planted in front, and
a broom-tree on the right united it with the willow;
in the middle there was a deal table.</P>
<P>&startq;Now, young ladies,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dub&s;ter, &startq;if
you have a ta&s;te to brea$he a little fre&s;h country air,
here's where I advi&s;e you to take your re&s;t. When
I come to this place fir&s;t, my arbour, as I call this,
had no look out, but ju&s;t to the fields, &s;o I cut away
them lilacs, and now there's a good pretty look out.
And it's a thing not to be believed what a &s;ight of
people and coaches, and gentlemen's whi&s;keys, and
&s;tages, and flys, and waggons, and all &s;orts of things
as ever you can think of, goes by all day long. I
often think people's got but little to do at home.&endq;</P>
<P>Next, he de&s;ired to lead them to his grotto, which
he &s;aid was but ju&s;t begun. It was, indeed, as yet,
nothing but a little &s;quare hole, dug into a chalky
&s;oil, down into which, no &s;teps being yet made, he
&s;lided as well as he could, to the no &s;mall whitening
of his old brown coat, which already was thread
bare.</P>
<P>He begged the ladies to follow, that he might &s;hew
them the devices he had marked out with his own
hand, and from his own head, for fitting up the in|&s;ide.
Lionel would not &s;uffer his &s;i&s;ters to refu&s;e
compliance, though Mr. Dub&s;ter him&s;elf cautioned
them to come carefully, &startq;in particular,&endq; he &s;aid,
&startq;the little lady, as &s;he has happened of an ugly ac|cident
already, as I judge, in one of her hips, and
'twould be pity, at her time of life, if &s;he &s;hould
happen of another at t'other &s;ide.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="145">
Eugenia, not aware this misfortune was &s;o glaring,
felt much hurt by this &s;peech; and Camilla, very
angry with its &s;peaker, &s;ought to &s;ilence him by a re|&s;entful
look; but not ob&s;erving it; &startq;Pray, ma'am,&endq;
he continued, &startq;was it a fall? or was you born &s;o?&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia looked &s;truck and &s;urprized; and Ca|milla
ha&s;tily whi&s;pered it was a fall, and bid him &s;ay
no more about it; but, not under&s;tanding her, &startq;I
take it, then,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;that was what &s;tinted your
growth &s;o, Mi&s;s? for, I take it, you're not much
above the dwarf as they &s;hew at Exeter Change?
Much of a muchne&s;s, I gue&s;s. Did you ever &s;ee
him, ma'am?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Sir.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It would be a good &s;ight enough to &s;ee you to|gether.
He'd think him&s;elf a man in a minute.
You mu&s;t have had the &s;mall pox mortal bad, ma'am.
I &s;uppo&s;e you'd the conflint &s;ort?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla here, without waiting for help, &s;lid down
into the intended grotto, and a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;|tions
to change the &s;ubject; while Eugenia, much
di&s;concerted, &s;lowly followed, aided by Lionel.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter then di&s;played the ingenious inter|mixture
of circles and diamonds projected for the
embelli&s;hment of his grotto; the fir&s;t of which were
to be formed with cockle-&s;hells, which he meant to
colour with blue paint: and the &s;econd he propo&s;ed
&s;haping with bits of &s;hining black coal. The &s;paces
between would each have an oy&s;ter-&s;hell in the middle,
and here and there he de&s;igned to leave the chalk to
it&s;elf, which would always, he ob&s;erved, make the
grotto light and cheary. Shells he &s;aid, unluckily,
he did not happen to have; but as he had thoughts
of taking a little plea&s;ure &s;ome &s;ummer at Bright|helm&s;tone
or Margate, for he intended to &s;ee all tho&s;e
places, he &s;hould make a collection then; being told
he might have as curious &s;hells, and pebbles too, as a
man could wi&s;h to look at, only for the trouble of
picking them up off the &s;hore.</P>
<P>They next went to what he called his labyrinth,
which was a little walk he was cutting, zig-zag, through
<PB N="337" REF="146">
&s;ome bru&s;h-wood, &s;o low that no per&s;on above three
$oot height could be hid by it. Every &s;tep they took
here, co&s;t a rent to &s;ome lace or &s;ome mu&s;lin of one
of the &s;i&s;ters; which Mr. Dub&s;ter ob&s;erved with a
delight he could not conceal; &s;aying this was a true
country walk, and would do them both a great deal of
good; and adding: &startq;we that live in town, would
give our ears for &s;uch a thing as this.&endq; And though
they could never proceed a yard at a time, from the
continual nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;entangling their dre&s;s from
thorns and briars, he exultingly boa&s;ted that he &s;hould
give them a good appetite for their dinner; and
a&s;ked if this rural ramble did not make them begin
to feel hungry. &startq;For my part,&endq; continued he,
&startq;if once I get &s;ettled a bit, I &s;hall take a turn in
this zig-zag every day before dinner, which may &s;ave
me my five grains of rhubarb, that the doctor or|dered
me for my &s;tomach, &s;ince my having my ill|ne&s;s,
which come upon me almo&s;t as &s;oon as I was a
gentleman; from change of life, I believe, for I
never knew no other rea&s;on; and none of the doc|tors
could tell me nothing about it. But a man
that's had a deal to do, feels quite unked at fir&s;t,
when he's only got to look and &s;$are about him, and
ju&s;t walk from one room to another, without no em|ployment.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel &s;aid he hoped, at lea&s;t, he would not re|quire
his rhubarb to get down his dinner to-day.</P>
<P>&startq;I hope &s;o too, '&s;quire,&endq; an&s;wered he, licking
his lips, &startq;for I've ordered a pretty good one, I can
tell you; beef &s;teaks and onions; and I don't know
what's better. Tom Hicks is to dine with me at the
Globe, as &s;oon as I've give my workmen their ta&s;ks,
and &s;een after a young lad that's to do me a job there,
by my grot to. Tom Hicks is a very good fellow;
I like him be&s;t of any acquaintance I've made in
the&s;e here parts. Indeed, I've made no other, on
account of the unconvenence of dre&s;&s;ing, while I'm
&s;o much about with my workmen. So I keep pretty
incog from the genteel; and Tom does well enough
in the interim.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="147">
He then reque&s;ted them to make ha&s;te to his
&s;ummer-hou&s;e, becau&s;e his workmen would be &s;oon
returned, and he could not then &s;pare a moment
longer, without &s;poiling his own dinner.</P>
<P>&startq;My &s;ummer hou&s;e,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;is not above half
complete yet; but it will be very pretty when it's
done. Only I've got no &s;tai$s yet to it; but there's
a very good ladder, if the ladies a$n't afraid.&endq;</P>
<P>The ladies both de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed mounting;
but Lionel prote&s;ted he would not have his friend
affronted; and as neither of them were in the habit
of re&s;i&s;ting him, nor of inve&s;tigating with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s
any thing that he propo&s;ed, they were &s;oon teized
into acquie&s;cence, and he a&s;&s;i&s;ted them to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter followed.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer-hou&s;e was, as yet, no more than a
&s;hell; without windows, &s;carcely roofed, and com|po&s;ed
of lath and plai&s;ter, not half dry. It looked
on to the high road, and Mr. Dub&s;ter a&s;&s;ured them,
that, on market days, the people pa&s;&s;ed &s;o thick,
there was no &s;eeing them for the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Here they had &s;oon cau&s;e to repent their facility,
&mdash;that dangerous, yet venial, becau&s;e natural fault
of youth; for hardly had they entered this place,
ere a di&s;tant glimp&s;e of a fleet &s;tag, and a party of
&s;port&s;men, incited Lionel to &s;camper down; and
calling out: &startq;I &s;hall be back pre&s;ently,&endq; he made
off towards the hou&s;e, dragging the ladder after
him.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters eagerly and almo&s;t angrily remon&s;trat|ed;
but to no purpo&s;e; and while they were &s;till
entreating him to return, and &s;uppo&s;ing him, though
out of &s;ight, within hearing, they &s;uddenly per|ceived
him pa&s;&s;ing the window by the high road, on
hor&s;e-back, &s;witch in hand, and looking in the ut|mo&s;t
glee. &startq;I have borrowed Jacob's mare,&endq; he
cried, &startq;for ju&s;t half an hour's &s;port, and &s;ent Jacob
and coachy to get a little refre&s;hment at the next
public hou&s;e; but don't be impatient; I &s;han't be
long.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="148">
Off then, he galloped, laughing; in defiance of
the &s;erious entreaties of his &s;i&s;ters, and without &s;tay|ing
to hear even one &s;entence of the $ormal exhorta|tions
of Mr. Dub&s;ter.</P>

<DIV1 N="38" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A few Compliments.</HEAD>
<P>THE two young ladies and Mr. Dub&s;ter left thus
together, and &s;o &s;ituated that &s;eparation without a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
was impo&s;&s;ible, looked at one another for
&s;ome time in nearly equal di&s;may; and then Mr.
Dub&s;ter, with much di&s;plea&s;ure, exclaimed&mdash;&startq;Them
young gentlemen are as full of mi&s;chief, as an egg's
full of meat! Who'd have thought of a per&s;on's
going to do &s;uch a thing as this?&mdash;it's mortal un|convenent,
making me leave my workmen at this
rate&punc; for I dare &s;ay they're come, or coming, by
this time. I wi&s;h I'd tied the ladder to this here
rafter.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters, though equally provoked, thought it
nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome apology $or the wild beha|viour
of their brother.</P>
<P>&startq;O, young ladies,&endq; &s;aid he, formally waving his
hand by way of a bow, &startq;I don't in the lea&s;t mean
to blame you about it, for you're very welcome to
&s;tay as long as it's agreeable; only I hope he'll
come back by my dinner time; for a cold beef-&s;teak
is one or other the wor&s;t mor&s;el I know.&endq;</P>
<P>He then kept an unremitting watch from one
window to another, for &s;ome pa&s;&s;enger from whom
he could claim aid; but, much as he had boa&s;ted of
the numbers perpetually in &s;ight, he now dolorou&s;ly
confe&s;&s;ed, that, &s;ometimes, not a &s;oul came near the
place for half a day together: &startq;And, as to my
workmen,&endq; continued he, &startq;the deuce can't make
<PB N="340" REF="149">
'em hear if once they begin their knocking and ham|mering.&endq;</P>
<P>And then, with a &s;mi$k at the idea, he added&mdash;
&startq;I'll tell you what; I'd be&s;t give a good &s;quall at
once, and then if they are come, I may catch 'em;
in the provi&s;o you won't mind it, young ladies.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;cheme was put immediately into practice;
but though the &s;i&s;ters were obliged to &s;top their ears
from his vociferation, it an&s;wered no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, I'll bet you what you will,&endq; cried he,
&startq;they are all deaf: however, it's as well as it is, for
if they was to come, and &s;ee me hoi&s;ted up in this
cage, like, they'd only make a joke of it; and then
they'd mind me no more than a pin never again.
It's &s;urpri&s;ing how them young gentlemen never
think of nothing. If he'd &s;erved me &s;o when I was
a 'prentice, he'd have paid pretty dear for his frolic;
ma&s;ter would have charged him half a day's work,
as &s;ure as a gun.&endq;</P>
<P>Soon after, while looking out of the window, &startq;I
do think,&endq; he exclaimed, &startq;I &s;ee &s;omebody!&mdash;It
&s;hall go hard but what I'll make 'em come to us.&endq;</P>
<P>He then &s;houted with great violence; but the per|&s;on
cro&s;&s;ed a &s;tyle into a field, without &s;eeing or hear|ing
him.</P>
<P>This provoked him very &s;eriou&s;ly; and turning to
Camilla, rather indignantly, he &s;aid&mdash;&startq;Really,
ma'am, I wi&s;h you'd tell your brother, I &s;hould take
it as a favour he'd never &s;erve me o' this manner no
more!&endq;</P>
<P>She hoped, &s;he &s;aid, he would in future be more
con&s;iderate.</P>
<P>&startq;It's a great hindrance to bu&s;ine&s;s, ma'am, &s;uch
things: and it's a &s;heer love of mi&s;chief, too, begging
pardon, fo$ it's of no manner of u&s;e to him, no
more than it is $o us.&endq;</P>
<P>He then de&s;ired, that if any body &s;hould pa&s;s by
again, they might all &s;quall out at once; &s;aying, it
was odds, then, but they might be heard.</P>
<P>&startq;Not that it's over agreeable at the be&s;t,&endq; added
he; &startq;for if one was to &s;top any poor per&s;on, and
<PB N="341" REF="150">
make 'em come round, and look for the ladder, one
could not be off giving them &s;omething: and as to
any of the gentlefolks, one might beg and pray as
long as one would before they'd &s;tir a &s;tep for one:
and as to any of one's acquaintance, if they was to
go by, it's ten to one but they'd only fall a laugh|ing.
People's generally ill-natured when they &s;ees
one in jeopardy.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, already thoughtful and di&s;compo&s;ed,
now grew unea&s;y, le&s;t her uncle &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed
at her long ab&s;ence; this a little appea&s;ed Mr. Dub|&s;ter,
who, with le&s;s re&s;entment, &s;aid&mdash;&startq;So I &s;ee,
then, we're all in the &s;ame quandary! However,
don't mind it, young ladies; you can have no great
matters to do with your time, I take it; &s;o it does
not &s;o much &s;ignify. But a man's quite different.
He looks like a fool, as one may &s;ay, poked up in
&s;uch a place as this, to be &s;tared at by all comers and
goers; only nobody happens to pa&s;s by.&endq;</P>
<P>His lamentations now were happily interrupted by
the appearance of three women and a boy, who,
with ba&s;kets on their heads, were returning from the
next market town. With infinite &s;atisfaction, he
prepared to a&s;&s;ail them, &s;aying, he &s;hould now have
&s;ome chance to get a bit of dinner: and a&s;&s;uring the
ladies, that if they-&s;hould like a little &s;crap for a re|li&s;h,
he &s;hould be very willing to &s;end 'em it by their
footman; &startq;For it's a long while,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;young
ladies, to be fa&s;ting, that's the truth of it.&endq;</P>
<P>The market women now approached, and were
mo&s;t clamorou&s;ly hailed, before their own loud di&s;|cour&s;e,
and the &s;inging and whi&s;tling of the boy,
permitted their hearing the appeal.</P>
<P>&startq;Pray, will you be &s;o kind,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dub&s;ter,
when he had made them &s;top, &startq;as to &s;tep round by
the hou&s;e, and &s;ee if you can &s;ee the workmen; and
if you can, tell 'em a young gentleman, as come here
while they was at dinner, has taken away the ladder,
and left us &s;tuck up here in the lurch.&endq;</P>
<P>The women all laughed, and &s;aid it was a good
merry trick; but were preparing to follow his di|rections,
<PB N="342" REF="151">
when Mr. Dub&s;ter called after the boy,
who loitered behind, with an encouraging nod: &startq;If
you'll bring the ladder with you upon your &s;houlders,
my lad, I'll give you a half-penny!&endq;</P>
<P>The boy was well contented; but the women, a
little alarmed, turned back and &s;aid&mdash;&startq;And what
will you give to us, ma&s;ter?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Give?&endq; repeated he, a little embarra&s;&s;ed;
&startq;why, I'll give&mdash;why I'll thank you kindly; and
it won't be much out of your way, for the hou&s;e is
only round there.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You'll thank us kindly, will you?&endq; &s;aid one of
the women; &startq;it's like you may! But what will you
do over and above?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do? why it's no great matter, ju&s;t to &s;top at
the hou&s;e as you go by, and tell 'em&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Here Eugenia whi&s;pered &s;he would her&s;elf &s;atisfy
them, and begged he would let them make their own
terms.</P>
<P>&startq;No, Mi&s;s, no; I don't like to &s;ee nobody's
money fooled away, no more than my own. How|ever,
as you are &s;o generous, I'll agree with 'em to
give 'em a pot of beer.&endq;</P>
<P>He then, with &s;ome parade, made this conce&s;&s;ion;
but &s;aid, he mu&s;t &s;ee the ladder, before the money
&s;hould be laid down.</P>
<P>&startq;A pot of beer for four!&mdash;a pot of beer for
four!&endq; they all exclaimed in a breath; and down
every one put her ba&s;ket, and &s;et her arms a kembo,
unanimou&s;ly declaring, they would &s;hame him for &s;uch
&s;tingine&s;s.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t violent abu&s;e now followed, the boy
imitating them, and every other &s;entence concluding
with&mdash;&startq;A pot of beer for four!&mdash;ha!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla and Eugenia, both frightened, be&s;ought
that they might have any thing, and every thing,
that could appea&s;e them: but Mr. Dub&s;ter was in|flexible
not to &s;ubmit to impo&s;ition, becau&s;e of a
few foul words; &startq;For, dear heart,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;what harm will they do us!&mdash;they an't of no con|&s;equence.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="152">
Then, addre&s;&s;ing them again, &startq;As to four,&endq; he
cried, &startq;that's one over the bargain, for I did not
reckon the boy for nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You didn't, didn't you?&endq; cried the boy;
&startq;i'cod, I hope I'm as good as you, any day in the
year!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You'll thank us kindly, will you?&endq; &s;aid one of
the women; &startq;I'fackens, and &s;o you &s;hall, when
we're fools enough to &s;arve you!&mdash;A pot of beer
for four!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We help you down!&mdash;we get you a ladder!&endq;
cried another; &startq;yes, for&s;ooth, it's like we may!
&mdash;no, &s;tay where you are, like a toad in a hole as
you be!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla and Eugenia now, tired of vain applica|tion
to Mr. Dub&s;ter, who heard all this abu&s;e with
the mo&s;t &s;edate unconcern, advanced them&s;elves to
the window; and Eugenia, ever foremo&s;t where
money was to be given, began&mdash;&startq;Good women&mdash;&endq;
when, with a violent loud &s;hout, they called out&mdash;
&startq;What! are you all in Hob's pound? Well, they
as will may let you out for we; &s;o I wi&s;h you a merry
time of it!&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia began again her&mdash;&startq;Good women&mdash;&endq;
when the boy exclaimed&mdash;&startq;What were you put up
there for, Mi&s;s? to frighten the crows?&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, not under&s;tanding him, was once more
re-commencing; but the fir&s;t woman &s;aid&mdash;&startq;I &s;up|po&s;e
you think we'll &s;arve you for looking at?&mdash;no
need to be paid?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, yes,&endq; cried the &s;econd, &startq;Mi&s;s may go to
market with her beauty; &s;he'll not want for nothing
if &s;he'll &s;hew her pretty face!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She need not be afeard of it, however,&endq; &s;aid
the third, &startq;for 'twill never be no wor&s;e. Only take
care, Mi&s;s, you don't catch the &s;mall pox!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O fegs, that would be pity!&endq; cried the boy,
&startq;for fear Mi&s;s &s;hould be marked.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, a&s;toni&s;hed and confounded, made no
farther attempt; but Camilla, though at that mo|ment
&s;he could have in&s;licted any puni&s;hment upon
<PB N="344" REF="153">
&s;uch unprovoked a&s;&s;ailants, affected to give but little
weight to what they &s;aid, and gently drew her away.</P>
<P>&startq;Hoity, toity!&endq; cried one of the women, as &s;he
moved off, &startq;why, Mi&s;s, do you walk upon your
knees?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why my Poll would make two of her,&endq; &s;aid
another, &startq;though &s;he's only nine years old.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She won't take much for cloaths,&endq; cried an|other,
&startq;that's one good thing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'd an&s;wer to make her a gown out of my apron,&endq;
&s;aid the third.</P>
<P>&startq;Your apron?&endq; cried another, &startq;your pocket
handkerchief you mean!&mdash;why &s;he'd be lo&s;t in your
apron, and you might look half an hour before you'd
find her.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, to whom &s;uch language was utterly new,
was now in &s;uch vi&s;ible con&s;ternation, that Camilla,
affrighted, earne&s;tly charged Mr. Dub&s;ter to find
any means, either of menace or of reward, to make
them depart.</P>
<P>&startq;Lauk, don't mind them, ma'am,&endq; cried he, fol|lowing
Eugenia, &startq;they can't do you no hurt;
though they are rather rude, I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s the
truth, to &s;ay &s;uch things to your face. But one
mu&s;t not expect people to be over polite, &s;o far from
London. However, I &s;ee the &s;porting gentry com|ing
round, over that way, yonder; and I warrant
they'll gallop 'em off. Hark'ce, Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es! them
gentlemen that are coming here, &s;hall take you be|fore
the ju&s;tice, for affronting Sir Hugh's Tyrold's
Heire&s;&s;es to all his fortunes.&endq;</P>
<P>The women, to whom the name and generous
deeds of Sir Hugh Tyrold were familiar, were now
quieted and di&s;mayed. They offered &s;ome aukward
apologies, of not gue&s;&s;ing &s;uch young ladies could
be po&s;ted up in &s;uch a place; and hoped it would be
no detriment to them at the en&s;uing Chri&s;tmas, when
the good Baronet gave away beef and beer; but
Mr. Dub&s;ter pompou&s;ly ordered them to make off,
&s;aying, he would not accept the ladder from them
now, for the gentry that were coming would get it
<PB N="345" REF="154">
for nothing: &startq;So troop off,&endq; cried he; &startq;and as
for you,&endq; to the boy, &startq;you &s;hall have your jacket
well trimmed, I promi&s;e you: I know who you are,
well enough: and I'll tell your ma&s;ter of you, as
&s;ure a$ you're alive.&endq;</P>
<P>Away then, with complete, though not well|principled
repentance, they all marched.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter, turning round with exultation,
cried&mdash;&startq;I only &s;aid that to frighten them, for I
never &s;ee 'em before, as I know of. But I don't
mind 'em of a ru&s;h; and I hope you don't neither.
Though I can't pretend it's over agreeable being
made fun of. If I &s;ee any body &s;nigger at me, I
always a&s;k 'em what it's for; for I'd as lieve they'd
let it alone.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, who, as there was no &s;eat, had &s;unk
upon the floor for re&s;t and for refuge, remained &s;ilent,
and &s;eemed almo&s;t petrified; while Camilla, affec|tionately
leaning over her, began talking upon other
&s;ubjects, in hopes to di&s;&s;ipate a &s;hock &s;he was a&s;hamed
to con&s;ole.</P>
<P>She made no reply, no comment; but, &s;ighed
deeply.</P>
<P>&startq;Lauk!&endq; cried Mr. Dub&s;ter, &startq;what's the
matter with the young lady! I hope &s;he don't go
for to take to heart what them old women &s;ays?
&s;he'll be never the wor&s;e to look at, becau&s;e of their
impudence. Be&s;ides, fretting does no good to
nothing. If you'll only come and &s;tand here, where
I do, Mi&s;s, you may have a peep at ever &s;o many
dogs, and all the gentlemen, riding helter &s;kelter
round that hill. It's a pretty &s;ight enough for them
as has nothing better to mind. I don't know but I
might make one among them my&s;elf, now and then,
if it was not for the expen&s;ivene&s;s of hiring of a
hor&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Here &s;ome of the party came galloping towards
them; and Mr. Dub&s;ter made &s;o loud an out-cry,
that two or three of the &s;port&s;men looked up, and
one of them, riding clo&s;e to the &s;ummer hou&s;e, per|ceived
the two young ladies, and, in&s;tantly di&s;mount|ing,
<PB N="346" REF="155">
fa&s;tened his hor&s;e to a tree, and contrived to
&s;cramble up into the little unfini&s;hed building.</P>
<P>Camilla then &s;aw it was Major Cerwood. She ex|plained
to him the mi&s;chievous frolic of her brother,
and accepted his offered &s;ervices to find the ladder
and the carriage.</P>
<P>Eugenia meanwhile ro&s;e and court&s;ied in an&s;wer
to his enquiries after her health, and then, gravely
fixing her eyes upon the ground, took no further
notice of him.</P>
<P>The object of the Major was not Eugenia; her
taciturnity therefore did not affect him; but plea&s;ed
to be &s;hut up with Camilla, he &s;oon found out that
though to mount had been ea&s;y, to de&s;cend would be
difficult; and, after various mock efforts, pronounc|ed
it would be nece&s;&s;ary to wait till &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance
arrived from below: adding, young Mr. Tyrold
would $oon return, as he had &s;een him in the hunt.</P>
<P>Camilla, who&s;e concern now was all for her &s;i&s;ter,
heard this with indifference; but Mr. Dub&s;ter lo&s;t
all patience. &startq;So here,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I may &s;tay,
and let Tom Hicks eat up all my dinner! for I can't
expect him to fa&s;t, becau&s;e of this young gentle|man's
comical tricks. I've half a mind to give a
jump down my&s;elf, and go look for the ladder; only
I'm not over light. Be&s;ides, if one &s;hould break
one's leg, it's but a hard thing upon a man to be a
cripple in the middle of life. It's no &s;uch great
hindrance to a lady, &s;o I don't &s;ay it out of di&s;re|&s;pect;
becau&s;e ladies can't do much at the be&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>The Major, finding Dub&s;ter was his ho&s;t, thought
it nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome notice of him, and a&s;ked
him if he never rode out.</P>
<P>&startq;Why no, not much of that, Sir,&endq; he an&s;wered;
&startq;for when a man's not over u&s;ed to riding, one's
apt to get a bad tumble &s;ometimes. I believe it's as
well let alone. I never &s;ee as there was much wit in
breaking one's neck before one's time. Be&s;ides,
half them gentlemen are no better than &s;harpers,
begging pardon, for all they look as if they could
knock-one down.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="156">
&startq;How do you mean &s;harpers, Sir?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why they don't pay every one his own, not one
in ten of them. And they're as proud as Lucifer.
If I was to go among them to-morrow, I'll lay a
wager they'd take no notice of me: unle&s;s I was to
a&s;k them to dinner. And a man may &s;oon eat up
his &s;ub&s;tance, if he's &s;o over complai&s;ant.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Surely, Major,&endq; cried Camilla, &startq;my brother
cannot be much longer before he joins us?&mdash;remem|bers
us rather.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who el&s;e could de&s;ert or forget you?&endq; cried the
Major.</P>
<P>&startq;It's a moot point whether he'll come or no, I
&s;ee that,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dub&s;ter, quite enraged; &startq;them
young '&s;quires never know what to do for their fun.
I mu&s;t needs &s;ay I think it's pity but what he'd been
brought up to &s;ome calling. 'Twould have &s;teadied
him a little, I warrant. He don't &s;eem to know
much of the troubles of life.&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;hower of rain now revived his hopes that the
fear of being wet might bring him back; not con|&s;idering
how little &s;port&s;men regard wet jackets.</P>
<P>&startq;However,&endq; continued he, &startq;it's really a piece
of good luck that he was not taken with a fancy to
leave us upon my i&s;land; and then we might all have
been &s;ou&s;ed by this here rain: and he could ju&s;t as
well have walked off with my bridge as with the
ladder.&endq;</P>
<P>Here, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible relief, Lionel, from the
road, hailed them; and Camilla, with emotion the
mo&s;t violent, perceived Edgar was by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter, however, angry as well as glad, very
&s;olemnly &s;aid, &startq;I wonder, Sir, what you think my
workmen has been doing all this time, with nobody
to look after them? Be&s;ides that I promi&s;ed a pot
o'beer to a lad to wheel me away all that rubbi&s;h that
I'd cut out of my grotto; and it's a good half day's
work, do it who will; and ten to one if they've
&s;tirred a nail, all left to them&s;elves &s;o.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="157">
&startq;Pho, pho, man, you've been too happy, I hope,
to trouble your mind about bu&s;ine&s;s. How do do,
my little girls? how have you been entertained?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is a better joke to you than to us, '&s;quire;
but pray, Sir, begging pardon, how come you to
forget what I told you about the Globe? I know
very well that they &s;ay it's quite alley-mode to make,
fun, but can't pretend as I'm over fond of the cu&s;|tom.&endq;</P>
<P>He then de&s;ired that, at lea&s;t, if he would not get
the ladder him&s;elf, he would tell that other gentle|man,
that was with him, what he had done with it.</P>
<P>Edgar, having met Lionel, and heard from him
how and where he had left his &s;i&s;ters, had impatiently
ridden with him to their relief; but when he &s;aw that
the Major made one in the little party, and that he
was &s;tanding by Camilla, he felt hurt and amazed,
and proceeded no farther.</P>
<P>Camilla believed her&s;elf carele&s;s of his opinion;
what &s;he had heard from Mi&s;s Margland of his pro|fe&s;&s;ed
indifference, gave her now as much re&s;entment;
as at fir&s;t it had cau&s;ed her grief. She thought &s;uch
a declaration an unprovoked indignity; &s;he deigned
not even to look at him, re&s;olved for ever to avoid
him; yet to prove her&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, unmor|tified
and di&s;engaged, talked cheerfully with the
Major.</P>
<P>Lionel now, producing the ladder, ran up it to
help his &s;i&s;ters to de&s;cend; and Edgar, di&s;mounting,
could not re&s;i&s;t entering the grounds, to offer them
his hand as they came down.</P>
<P>Eugenia was fir&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted; for Camilla talked on
with the Major, as if not hearing &s;he was called:
and Mr. Dub&s;ter, his complai&s;ance wholly worn out,
next followed, bowing low to every one &s;eparately,
and begging pardon, but &s;aying he could really afford
to wa&s;te no more time, without going to give a little
look after his workmen, to &s;ee if they were alive or
dead.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="158">
At this time the hor&s;e of the Major, by &s;ome ac|cident,
breaking loo&s;e, his ma&s;ter was forced to run
down, and Lionel &s;campered after to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>Camilla remained alone; Edgar, &s;lowly mounting
the ladder, gravely offered his &s;ervices; but, ha&s;tily
leaning out of the window, &s;he pretended to be too
much occupied in watching the motions of the Major
and his hor&s;e, to hear or attend to any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;igh now tore the heart of Edgar, from doubt
if this were preference to the Major, or the fir&s;t dawn
of incipient coquetry; but he called not upon her
again; he &s;tood quietly behind, till the hor&s;e was
&s;eized, and the Major re-a&s;cended the ladder. They
then &s;tood at each &s;ide of it, with offers of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>This appeared to Camilla a fortunate moment for
making a &s;pirited di&s;play of her indifference: &s;he
gave her hand to the Major, and, &s;lightly courte&s;ying
to Edgar as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, was conducted to the car|riage
of her uncle.</P>
<P>Lionel again was the only one who &s;poke in $he
&s;hort route to Etherington, whence Eugenia, with|out
alighting, returned to Cleves.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Danger of Di&s;gui&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>EDGAR remained behind, almo&s;t petrified: he
&s;tood in the little building looking after them, yet
neither de&s;cending nor &s;tirring, till one of the work|men
advanced to fetch the ladder. He then ha&s;tily
quitted the &s;pot, mounted his hor&s;e, and galloped
after the carriage; though without any actual de&s;ign
to follow it, or any formed purpo&s;e whither to go.</P>
<P>The &s;ight, however, of the Major, pur&s;uing the
&s;ame route, made him, with deep di&s;gu&s;t, turn about,
and take the &s;horte&s;t road to Beech Park.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="159">
He hardly breathed the whole way from indigna|tion;
yet his wrath was without definition, and
nearly beyond comprehen$ibility even to him&s;elf, till
&s;uddenly recurring to the lovely &s;mile with which
Camilla had accepted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Major Cer|wood,
he involuntarily cha&s;ped his hands, and called
out: &startq;O happy Major!&endq;</P>
<P>Awakened by this ejaculation to the true &s;tate of
his feelings, he &s;tarted as from a &s;word held at his
brea&s;t. &startq;Jealou&s;y!&endq; he cried, &startq;am I red$ced to
&s;o humiliating a pa&s;&s;ion? Am I capable of love with|out
tru&s;t? Unhappy enough to cheri&s;h it with hope?
No! I will not be &s;uch a &s;lave to the delu&s;ions of in|clination.
I will abandon neither my honour nor my
judgment to my wi&s;hes. It is not alone even her
heart that can fully &s;atisfy me; its delicacy mu&s;t be
mine as well as its preference. Jealou&s;y is a pa&s;&s;ion
for which my mind is not framed, and which I mu&s;t
not find a torment, but an impo&s;&s;ibility!&endq;</P>
<P>He now began to fear he had made a choice the
mo&s;t injudicious, and that coquet$y and caprice had
only waited opportunity, to take place of candour
and frankne&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet, recollecting the di&s;claiming &s;peeches he had
been compelled to make at Cleves, he thought, if
&s;he had heard them, &s;he might be actuated by re&s;ent|ment.
Even then, however, her manner of &s;hew|ing
it was alarming, and fraught with mi&s;chief. He
reflected with fre&s;h repugnance upon the gay and di&s;|&s;ipated
&s;ociety with which &s;he was newly mixing,
and which, from her extreme openne&s;s and facility,
might &s;o ea&s;ily, yet &s;o fatally, fully the fair artle&s;&s;|ne&s;s
of her mind.</P>
<P>He then felt tempted to hint to Mr. Tyrold, who,
viewing all things, and all people in the be&s;t light,
rarely fore&s;aw danger, and never &s;u&s;pected deception,
the expediency of her breaking off this intercour&s;e,
till &s;he could pur&s;ue it under the &s;ecurity of her mo|ther's
penetrating protection. But it occurred to
him, next, it was po&s;&s;ible the Major might have
plea&s;ed her. Ardent as were his own views, they
<PB N="351" REF="160">
had never been declared, while tho&s;e of the Major
&s;eemed proclaimed without re&s;erve. He felt his face
tingle at the idea, though it nearly made his heart
cea&s;e to beat; and determined to &s;atisfy this con|jecture
ere he took any mea&s;ure for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To &s;peak to her openly, he thought the &s;ure&s;t as
well as faire&s;t way, and re&s;olved, with whatever an|gui&s;h,
&s;hould he find the Major favoured, to aid her
choice in his fraternal character, and then travel till
he &s;hould forget her in every other.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make imme|diate
enquiry into the &s;ituation of the Major, and
then, if &s;he would hear him, relate to her the re&s;ult;
well a&s;&s;ured to gather the &s;tate of her heart upon this
&s;ubject, by her manner of attending to the lea&s;t word
by which it &s;hould be introduced.</P>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, was &s;omewhat comforted by
the exertion &s;he had &s;hewn, and by her hopes it had
&s;truck Edgar with re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The next morning, Sir Hugh &s;ent for her again,
and begged &s;he would pa&s;s the whole day with her
&s;i&s;ter Eugenia, and u&s;e all her pretty ways to amu&s;e
her: for &s;he had returned home, the preceding morn|ing,
quite moped with melancholy, and had con|tinued
pining ever &s;ince; refu&s;ing to leave her room,
even for meals, yet giving no rea&s;on for her behaviour.
What had come to her he could not tell; but to &s;ee
her &s;o, went to his heart; for &s;he had always, he
&s;aid, till now, been chearful and even tempered,
though thinking over her learning made her not much
of a young per&s;on.</P>
<P>Camilla flew up &s;tairs, and found her, with a look
of de&s;pondence, &s;eated in a corner of her room,
which &s;he had darkened by nearly &s;hutting all the
&s;hutters.</P>
<P>She knew but too well the rude &s;hock &s;he had re|ceived,
and &s;ought to revive her with every expre&s;&s;ion
of &s;oothing kindne&s;s. But &s;he &s;hook her head, and
<PB N="352" REF="161">
continued mute, melancholy, and wrapt in medita|tion.</P>
<P>More than an hour was &s;pent thus, the &s;trict or|ders
of Sir Hugh forbidding them any intru&s;ion:
but when, at length, Camilla ventured to &s;ay, &startq;Is
it po&s;&s;ible, my deare&s;t Eugenia, the pa&s;&s;ing in&s;olence
of two or three brutal wretches can affect you thus
deeply?&endq; She awakened from her &s;ilent trance, and
rai&s;ing her head, while &s;omething bordering upon
re&s;entment began to kindle in her brea&s;t, cried,
&startq;Spare me this que&s;tion, Camilla, and I will &s;pare
you all reproach.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What reproach, my dear &s;i&s;ter,&endq; cried Camilla,
amazed, &startq;what reproach have I merited?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The reproach,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, &s;olemnly; &startq;that,
from me, all my family merit! the reproach of re|pre&s;enting
to me, that thou&s;ands re&s;embled me! of
a&s;&s;uring me I had nothing peculiar to my&s;elf, though
I was &s;o unlike all my family&mdash;of deluding me into
utter ignorance of my unhappy defects, and then
ca&s;ting me, all uncon&s;cious and unprepared, into the
wide world to hear them!&endq;</P>
<P>She would now have &s;hut her&s;elf into her book|clo&s;et;
but Camilla, forcing her way, and almo&s;t
kneeling to be heard, conjured her to drive &s;uch cruel
ideas from her mind, and to treat the barbarous in|&s;ults
that &s;he had &s;uffered with the contempt they
de&s;erved.</P>
<P>&startq;Camilla,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, firmly; &startq;I am no longer
to be deceived nor trifled with. I will no more ex|po&s;e
to the light a form and face &s;o hideous:&mdash;I will
retire from all mankind, and end my de&s;tined cour&s;e
in a &s;olitude that no one &s;hall di&s;cover.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, terrified, be&s;ought her to form no &s;uch
plan, bewailed the unfortunate adventure of the pre|ceding
day, inveighed again&s;t the inhuman women,
and pleaded the love of all her family with the mo&s;t
energetic affection.</P>
<P>&startq;Tho&s;e women,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, calmly, &startq;are not to
blame; they have been untutored, but not fal&s;e; and
they have only uttered &s;uch truths as I ought to have
<PB N="353" REF="162">
learnt from my cradle. My own blindne&s;s has been
infatuated; but it &s;prung from inattention and ig|norance.
&mdash;It is now removed!&mdash;Leave me, Camilla;
give notice to my Uncle he mu&s;t find me &s;ome re|treat.
Tell all that has pa&s;&s;ed to my father. I will
my&s;elf write to my mother&mdash;and when my mind is
more &s;ubdued, and when &s;incerely and unaffectedly I
can forgive you all from my heart, I may con&s;ent to
&s;ee you again.&endq;</P>
<P>She then po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted upon being left.</P>
<P>Camilla, penetrated with her unde&s;erved, yet irre|mediable
di&s;tre&s;s, &s;till continued at her door, &s;up|plicating
for re-admittance in the &s;ofte&s;t terms; but
without any &s;ucce&s;s till the &s;econd dinner bell &s;um|moned
her down &s;tairs. She then fervently called
upon her &s;i&s;ter to &s;peak once more, and tell her what
&s;he mu&s;t do, and what &s;ay?</P>
<P>Eugenia, &s;teadily an&s;wered: &startq;You have already
my commi&s;&s;ion: I have no change to make in it.&endq;</P>
<P>Unable to obtain any thing further, &s;he painfully
de&s;cended: but the voice of her Uncle no &s;ooner
reached her ears from the dining parlour, than, &s;hock|ed
to convey to him &s;o terrible a me&s;&s;age, &s;he again
ran up &s;tairs, and ca&s;ting her&s;elf again&s;t her &s;i&s;ter's
door, called out &startq;Eugenia, I dare not obey you!
would you kill my poor Uncle? My Uncle, who
loves us all &s;o tenderly? Would you afflict&mdash;would
you make him unhappy?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, not for the univer&s;e!&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, open|ing
the door; and then, more gently, yet not le&s;s
&s;tedfa&s;tly, looking at her, &startq;I know,&endq; &s;he continued,
&startq;you are all very good; I know all was meant for
the be&s;t; I know I mu&s;t be a mon&s;ter not to love
you for the very error to which I am a victim.&mdash;I
forgive you therefore all! and I blu&s;h to have felt
angry.&mdash;But yet&mdash;at the age of fifteen&mdash;at the in|&s;tant
of entering into the world&mdash;at the approach of
forming a connection which&mdash;O Camilla! what a time,
what a period, to di&s;cover&mdash;to know&mdash;that I cannot
even be &s;een without being derided and offended!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="163">
Her voice here faultered, and, running to the
window curtain, &s;he entwined her&s;elf in its folds, and
called out: &startq;O hide me! hide me! from every hu|man
eye, from every thing that lives and breathes!
Pur&s;ue me, per&s;ecute me no longer, but &s;uffer me to
abide by my&s;elf, till my fortitude is better &s;trength|ened
to meet my de&s;tiny!&endq;</P>
<P>The lea&s;t impatience from Eugenia was too rare to
be oppo&s;ed; and Camilla, who, in common with all
her family, notwith&s;tanding her extreme youth, re|&s;pected
as much as &s;he loved her, &s;ought only to ap|pea&s;e
her by promi&s;ing compliance. She gave to her,
therefore, an unre&s;i&s;ted, though unreturned embrace,
and went to the dining parlour.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was much di&s;appointed to &s;ee her with|out
her &s;i&s;ter; but &s;he evaded any account of her
commi&s;&s;ion till the meal was over, and then begged
to &s;peak with him alone.</P>
<P>Gently and gradually &s;he di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ource of the
&s;adne&s;s of Eugenia; but Sir Hugh heard it with a
di&s;may that almo&s;t overwhelmed him. All his con|trition
for the evils of which, unhappily, he had
been the cau&s;e, returned with the &s;evere&s;t force, and
far from oppo&s;ing her &s;cheme of retreat, he em|powered
Camilla to offer her any re&s;idence &s;he cho&s;e;
and to tell her he would keep out of her &s;ight, as
the cau&s;e of all her misfortunes; or give her the imme|diate
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and di&s;po&s;al of his whole e&s;tate, if
that would make her better amends than to wait till
his death.</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;age was no &s;ooner delivered to Eugenia,
than lo&s;ing at once every angry impre&s;&s;ion, &s;he ha&s;|tened
down &s;tairs, and ca&s;ting her&s;elf at the knees of
her Uncle, begged him to pardon her de&s;ign, and
promi&s;ed never to leave him while &s;he lived.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, mo&s;t affectionately embracing her, &s;aid
&mdash;&startq;You are too good, my dear, a great deal too
good, to one who has u&s;ed you &s;o ill, at the very
time when you were too young to help your&s;elf. I
have not a word to offer in my own behalf; except to
<PB N="355" REF="164">
hope you will forgive me, for the &s;ake of its being
all done out of pure ignorance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas, my deare&s;t Uncle! all I owe to your in|tentions,
is the deepe&s;t gratitude: and it is your's
from the bottom of my heart. Chance alone was
my enemy; and all I have to regret is, that no one
was &s;incere enough, kind enough, con&s;iderate enough,
to in&s;truct me of the extent of my misfortunes, and
prepare me for the attacks to which I am liable.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear girl,&endq; &s;aid he, while tears &s;tarted into
his eyes, &startq;what you &s;ay nobody can reply to; and
I find I have been doing you one wrong after another,
in&s;tead of the lea&s;t good; for all this was by my own
order; which it is but fair to your brothers and
&s;i&s;ters, and father and mother, and the &s;ervants, to
confe&s;s. God knows, I have faults enough of my
own upon my head, without taking another of pre|tending
to have none!&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia now &s;ought to condole him in her turn,
voluntarily promi&s;ing to mix with the family as u&s;ual,
and only de&s;iring to be excu&s;ed from going abroad, or
&s;eeing any &s;trangers.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;you &s;hall judge ju&s;t what
you think fit, which is the lea&s;t thing I can do for
you, after your being &s;o kind as to forgive me; which
I hope to do nothing in future not to de&s;erve more;
meaning always to a&s;k my brother's advice: which
might have &s;aved me all my wor&s;t actions, if I had
done it &s;ooner; for I've u&s;ed poor Camilla no better;
except not giving her the &s;mall pox, and that bad
fall. But don't hate me, my dears, if you can help
it, for it was none of it done for want of love; only
not knowing how to &s;hew it in the proper manner;
which I hope you'll excu&s;e for the &s;core o$ my bad
education.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, my Uncle!&endq; cried Camilla, throwing her
arms round his neck, while Eugenia embraced his
knees, &startq;what language is this for nieces who owe &s;o
much to your goodne&s;s, and who, next to their pa|rents,
love you more than any thing upon earth!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="165">
&startq;You are both the be&s;t little girls in the world,
my dears, and I need have nothing upon my con|&s;cience
if you two pa&s;s it over; which is a great re|lief
to me; for there's nobody el&s;e I've u&s;ed &s;o bad
as you two young girls; which, God knows, goes
to my heart whenever I think of it.&mdash;Poor little in|nocents!&mdash;what
had you ever done to provoke me?&endq;</P>
<P>The two &s;i&s;ters, with the mo&s;t virtuous emulation,
vied with each other in demon&s;trative affection, till
he was tolerably con&s;oled.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the day was ruffled but for one mo|ment;
upon Sir Hugh's an&s;wering, to a propo&s;ition
of Mi&s;s Margland for a party to the next Middleton
races,&mdash;that there was no refu&s;ing to let Eugenia
take that plea&s;ure, after her behaving &s;o nobly: her
face was then again overca&s;t with the deepe&s;t gloom;
and &s;he begged not to hear of the races, nor of any
other place, public or private, for going abroad, as
&s;he meant during the re&s;t of her life, immoveably to
remain at home.</P>
<P>He looked much concerned, but a&s;&s;ured her &s;he
&s;hould be mi&s;tre&s;s in every thing.</P>
<P>Camilla left them in the evening, with a promi&s;e
to return the next day; and with every anxiety of
her own, lo&s;t in pity for her innocent and unfortu|nate
&s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>She was &s;oon, however, called back to her&s;elf,
when, with what light yet remained, &s;he &s;aw Edgar
ride up to the coach door.</P>
<P>With indefatigable pains he had devoted the day
to the &s;earch of information concerning the Major.
Of Mrs. Arlbery he had learned, that he was a man
of fa&s;hion, but &s;mall fortune; and from the En&s;ign
he had gathered, that even that &s;mall fortune was
gone, and that the e&s;tate in which it was ve&s;ted, had
been mortgaged for three thou&s;and pounds, to pay
certain debts of honour.</P>
<P>Edgar had already been to the Par&s;onage Hou&s;e,
but hearing Camilla was at Cleves, had made a &s;hort
vi&s;it, and determined to walk his hor&s;e upon the road
<PB N="357" REF="166">
till he met the carriage of Sir Hugh; believing he
could have no better opportunity of &s;eeing her alone.</P>
<P>Yet when the coach, upon his riding up to the
door, &s;topt, he found him&s;elf in an embarra&s;&s;ment
for which he was unprepared. He a&s;ked how &s;he did;
de&s;ired news of the health of all the family one by
one; and then, &s;truck by the coldne&s;s of her an|&s;wers,
&s;uffered the carriage to drive on.</P>
<P>Confounded at &s;o &s;udden a lo&s;s of all pre&s;ence of
mind, he continued, for a minute or two, ju&s;t where
&s;he left him; and then galloped after the coach, and
again pre&s;ented him&s;elf at its window.</P>
<P>In a voice and manner the mo&s;t hurried, he apo|logi&s;ed
for this &s;econd detention&punc; &startq;But, I believe,&endq;
he &s;aid, &startq;&s;ome genius of officiou&s;ne&s;s has to-day
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, for I began it upon a Quix|ote
&s;ort of enterpri&s;e, and a &s;pirit of knight errantry
&s;eems willing to accompany me through it to the
end.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topt; but &s;he did not &s;peak. Her fir&s;t &s;en|&s;ation
at his &s;ight had been wholly indignant; but
when &s;he found he had &s;omething to &s;ay which he
knew not how to pronounce, her curio&s;ity was
awakened, and &s;he looked earne&s;t for an explanation.</P>
<P>&startq;I know,&endq; he re&s;umed, with con&s;iderable he&s;ita|tion,
&startq;that to give advice and to give pain is com|monly
the &s;ame thing;&mdash;I do not, therefore, mean&mdash;
I have no intention&mdash;though &s;o lately you allowed
me a privilege never to be forgotten&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>He could not get on; and his embarra&s;&s;ment, and
this recollection, &s;oon robbed Camilla of every angry
emotion&punc; She looked down, but her countenance
was full of &s;en&s;ibility, and Edgar, recovering his
voice, proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;My Quixoti&s;m, I was going to &s;ay, of this
morning, though for a per&s;on of whom I know al|mo&s;t
nothing, would urge me to every po&s;&s;ible ef|fort&mdash;were
I certain the re&s;ult would give plea&s;ure to
the per&s;on for whom alo$$&mdash;&s;ince with regard to
him&s;elf,&mdash;I&mdash;it is merely&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="167">
Involved in expre&s;&s;ions he knew not how to clear or
to fini&s;h, he was again without breath; and Camilla,
rai&s;ing her eyes, looked at him with a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Endeavouring then to laugh, &startq;One would think,&endq;
cried he, &startq;this &s;ame Quixoti&s;m had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of my intellects, and rendered them as confu&s;ed as if,
in&s;tead of an agent, I were a principal.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Still wholly in the dark as to his aim, yet, &s;ati&s;|fied
by the&s;e la&s;t words, it had no reference to him|&s;elf,
&s;he now lo&s;t enough of the acutene&s;s of her cu|rio&s;ity
to dare avow what yet remained; and begged
him, without further preface, to be more explicit.</P>
<P>Stammering, he then &s;aid, that the evident admi|ration
with which a certain gentleman was &s;een to
&s;igh in her train, had awakened for him an intere&s;t,
which had induced &s;ome inquiries into the &s;tate of
his pro&s;pects and expectations. &startq;The&s;e,&endq; he con|tinued,
&startq;turn out to be, though not high, nor by
any means adequate to&mdash;to&mdash;however they are
&s;uch as &s;ome previous friendly exertions, with &s;ettled
future oeconomy, might render more propitious:
and for tho&s;e previous exertions&mdash;Mr. Tyrold has a
claim which it would be the pride and happine&s;s of
my life to &s;ee him honour;&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The if almo&s;t dropt inarticulated; but he added&mdash;
&startq;I &s;hall make &s;ome further enquiries before I ven|ture
to &s;ay any more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For your&s;elf, then, be they made, Sir!&endq; cried
&s;he, &s;uddenly &s;eizing the whole of the meaning&mdash;
&startq;not for me?&mdash;whoever this per&s;on may be to whom
you allude&mdash;to me he is utterly indifferent.&endq;</P>
<P>A fla&s;h of involuntary delight beamed in the eyes
of Edgar at the&s;e words; he had almo&s;t thanked
her, he had almo&s;t dropt the reins of his hor&s;e to
cla&s;p his hands: but filled only with her own emo|tions,
without watching his, or waiting for any an|&s;wer,
&s;he coldly bid him good night, and called to
the coachman to drive fa&s;t home.</P>
<P>Edgar, however, was left with a &s;un-beam of the
mo&s;t lively delight. &startq;He is wholly indifferent to
her,&endq; he cried, &startq;&s;he is angry at my interference;
<PB N="359" REF="168">
&s;he has but acted a part in the apparent preference&mdash;
and for <HI>me,</HI> perhaps, acted it!&endq;</P>
<P>Momentary, however, was the plea&s;ure &s;uch a
thought could afford him;&mdash;&startq;O, Camilla,&endq; he
cried, &startq;if, indeed, I might hope from you any par|tiality,
why act any part at all!&mdash;how plain, how
ea&s;y, how direct your road to my heart, if but
&s;traightly pur&s;ued!&endq;</P>

<P>CAMILLA went on to Etherington in deep di&s;|tre&s;s;
every ray of hope was chaced from her pro&s;|pects,
with a certainty more cruel, though le&s;s of|fen&s;ive
to her feelings, than the cru&s;h given them by
Mi&s;s Margland. He cares not for me! &s;he cried;
he even de&s;tines me for another! He is the willing
agent of the Major; he would portion me, I &s;up|po&s;e,
for him, to accelerate the impo&s;&s;ibility of ever
thinking of me! And I imagined he loved me!&mdash;
what a dream!&mdash;what a dream!&mdash;how has he deceived
me!&mdash;or, alas! how have I deceived my&s;elf!</P>
<P>She rejoiced, however, that &s;he had made &s;o de|cided
an an&s;wer with regard to Major Cerwood,
whom &s;he could not doubt to be the per&s;on meant,
and who, pre&s;ented in &s;uch a point of view, grew
utterly odious to her.</P>
<P>The tale &s;he had to relate to Mr. Tyrold, of the
&s;ufferings and &s;ad re&s;olution of Eugenia, obviated
all comment upon her own di&s;turbance. He was
wounded to the heart by the recital. &startq;Alas!&endq; he
cried, &startq;your wi&s;e and excellent mother always fore|&s;aw
&s;ome mi&s;chief would en&s;ue, from the extreme
caution u&s;ed to keep this dear unfortunate child ig|norant
of her peculiar &s;ituation. This dreadful &s;hake
<PB N="360" REF="169">
might have been palliated, at lea&s;t, if not &s;pared, by
the le&s;&s;ons of fortitude that noble woman would have
inculcated in her young and ductile mind. But I
could not re&s;i&s;t the painful entreaties of my poor
brother, who, thinking him&s;elf the author of her
calamities, believed he was re&s;pon&s;ible for &s;aving her
from feeling them; and, imagining all the world as
&s;oft hearted as him&s;elf, concluded, that what her
own family would not tell her, &s;he could never hear
el&s;ewhere. But who &s;hould leave any events to the
caprices of chance, which the precautions of fore|&s;ight
can determine?&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections, and the thoughts of her &s;i&s;ter,
led at once and aided Camilla to &s;tifle her own un|happine&s;s;
and for three days following, &s;he devoted
her&s;elf wholly to Eugenia.</P>
<P>On the morning of the fourth, in&s;tead of &s;ending
the carriage, Sir Hugh arrived him&s;elf to fetch Ca|milla,
and to tell his brother, he mu&s;t come al&s;o, to
give comfort to Eugenia; for, though he had thought
the wor&s;t was over, becau&s;e &s;he appeared quiet in his
pre&s;ence, he had ju&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed her in tears, by com|ing
upon her unawares. He had done all he could,
he &s;aid, in vain; and nothing remained but for Mr.
Tyrold to try his hand him&s;elf: &startq;For it is but ju&s;|tice,&endq;
he added, &startq;to Dr. Orkborne, to &s;ay &s;he is
wi&s;er than all our poor heads put together; &s;o that
there is no an&s;wering her for want of &s;en&s;e.&endq; He
then told him to be &s;ure to put one of his be&s;t &s;er|mons
in his pocket to read to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was extremely touched for his poor
Eugenia, yet &s;aid he had half an hour's bu&s;ine&s;s to
tran&s;act in the neighbourhood, before he could go to
Cleves. Sir Hugh wai$ed his time, and all three
then proceeded together.</P>
<P>Eugenia received her Father with a deliberate cold|ne&s;s
that &s;hocked him. He &s;aw how profound was
the impre&s;&s;ion made upon her mind, not merely of
her per&s;onal evils, but of what &s;he conceived to be
the mi&s;conduct of her friends.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="170">
After a little general di&s;cour&s;e, in which &s;he bore
no &s;hare, he propo&s;ed walking in the park; meaning
there to take her a&s;ide, with le&s;s formality than he
could otherwi&s;e de&s;ire to &s;peak with her alone.</P>
<P>The ladies and Sir Hugh immediately looked for
their hats or gloves: but Eugenia, &s;aying &s;he had a
&s;light head-ache, walked away to her room.</P>
<P>&startq;This, my dear brother,&endq; cried Sir Hugh, &s;or|rowfully
following her with his eyes, &startq;is the very
thing I wanted you for; &s;he &s;ays &s;he'll never more
&s;tir out of the&s;e doors as long as &s;he's alive; which
is a &s;ad thing to &s;ay, con&s;idering her young years;
and nobody knowing how Clermont may approve it.
However, it's well I've had him brought up from the
beginning to the cla&s;&s;ics, which I rejoice at every day
more and more, it being the only wi&s;e thing I ever
did of my own head; for as to talking Latin and Greek,
which I &s;uppo&s;e is what they will chiefly be doing,
there's no doubt but they may do it ju&s;t as well in a
room as in the fields, or the &s;treets.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, after a little con&s;ideration, followed
her. He tapped at her door; &s;he a&s;ked, in a tone
of di&s;plea&s;ure, who was there?&mdash;&startq;Your Father, my
dear,&endq; he an&s;wered; and then, ha&s;tily opening it,
&s;he propo&s;ed returning with him down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; he &s;aid; &startq;I wi&s;h to conver&s;e with you
alone. The opinion I have long cheri&s;hed of your
heart and your under&s;tanding, I come now to put to
the proof.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, certain of the &s;ubject to which he would
lead, and feeling &s;he could not have more to hear
than to &s;ay, gave him a chair, and compo&s;edly &s;eated
her&s;elf next to him.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Eugenia,&endq; &s;aid he, taking her pa&s;&s;ive
hand, &startq;this is the moment that more grievou&s;ly
than ever I lament the ab&s;ence of your invaluable
Mother. All I have to offer to your con&s;ideration
&s;he could much better have laid before you; and her
dictates would have met with the attention they &s;o
completely de&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="171">
&startq;Was my Mother, then, Sir,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, re|proachfully,
&startq;unapprized of the worldly darkne&s;s
in which I have been brought up? Is &s;he unac|quainted
that a little knowledge of books and lan|guages
is what alone I have been taught?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We are all but too apt,&endq; an&s;wered Mr. Tyrold,
mildly, though &s;urpri&s;ed, &startq;to deem nothing worth
attaining but what we have mi&s;&s;ed, nothing worth
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing but what we are denied. How many are
there, among&s;t the untaught and unaccompli&s;hed,
who would think an e&s;cape &s;uch as yours, of all in|tellectual
darkne&s;s, a compen&s;ation for every other
evil!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They could think &s;o only, Sir, while, like me,
they lived immured always in the &s;ame hou&s;e, were
&s;een always by the &s;ame people, and were total
&s;trangers to the &s;en&s;ations they might excite in any
others.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Eugenia, grieved as I am at the pre|&s;ent
&s;ubject of your ruminations, I rejoice to &s;ee in
you a power of reflection, and of combination, &s;o
far above your years. And it is a foothing idea to me
to dwell upon the ultimate benevolence of Providence,
even in circum&s;tances the mo&s;t afflicting: for if
chance has been unkind to you, Nature &s;eems, with
fo&s;tering fore&s;ight, to have endowed you with pre|ci&s;ely
tho&s;e powers that may be&s;t &s;$t a&s;ide her ma|lignity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;ee, Sir,&endq; cried &s;he, a little moved, &startq;the
kindne&s;s of your intention; but pardon me if I an|ticipate
to you its ill &s;ucce&s;s. I have thought too
much upon my &s;ituation and my de&s;tiny to admit any
fallacious comfort. Can you, indeed, when once
her eyes are opened, can you expect to reconcile to
exi&s;tence a poor young creature who &s;ees her&s;elf an
object of deri&s;ion and di&s;gu&s;t? Who, without com|mitting
any crime, without offending any human
being, finds &s;he cannot appear but to be pointed at,
&s;coffed and in&s;ulted!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O my child! with what a picture do you wound
my heart, and tear your own peace and happine&s;s!
<PB N="363" REF="172">
Wretches who in &s;uch a light can view outward de|ficiencies
cannot merit a thought, are below even
contempt, and ought not be di&s;dained, but forgotten.
Make a conque&s;t, then, my Eugenia, of your&s;elf;
be as &s;uperior in your feelings as in your under&s;tand|ing,
and remember what Addi&s;on admirably &s;ays in
one of the Spectators: &startq;A too acute &s;en&s;ibility of
per&s;onal defects, is one of the greate&s;t weakne&s;&s;es of
&s;elf-love.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hould be &s;orry, Sir, you &s;hould attribute to
vanity what I now &s;uffer. No! it is &s;imply the ef|fect
of never hearing, never knowing, that &s;o &s;evere
a call was to be made upon my fortitude, and there|fore
never arming my&s;elf to &s;u&s;tain it.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, &s;uddenly, and with great emotion cla&s;ping
her hands: &startq;O if ever I have a family of my own,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;my fir&s;t care &s;hall be to tell my daugh|ters
of all their infirmities! They &s;hall be familiar,
from their childhood, to their every defect&mdash;Ah!
they mu&s;t be odious indeed if they re&s;emble their
poor mother!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My deare&s;t Eugenia! let them but re&s;emble you
mentally, and there is no per&s;on, who&s;e approbation
is worth de&s;erving, that will not love and re&s;pect
them. Good and evil are much more equally divided
in this world than you are yet aware: none po&s;&s;e&s;s
the fir&s;t without alloy, nor the &s;econd without pallia|tion.
Indiana, for example, now in the full bloom
of all that beauty can be&s;tow, tell me, and a&s;k your|&s;elf
&s;trictly, would you change with Indiana?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With Indiana?&endq; &s;he exclaimed; &startq;O! I would
forfeit every other good to change with Indiana!
Indiana, who never appears but to be admired, who
never &s;peaks but to be applauded.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yet a little, yet a moment, que&s;tion, and un|der&s;tand
your&s;elf before you &s;ettle you would change
with her. Look forward, and look inward. Look
forward, that you may view the &s;hort life of admira|tion
and applau&s;e for &s;uch attractions from others,
and their inutility to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in every moment
of &s;olitude or repo&s;e; and look inward, that you
<PB N="364" REF="173">
may learn to value your own peculiar riches, for times
of retirement, and for days of infirmity and age!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, Sir,&mdash;and pray believe me, I do not
mean to repine I have not the beauty of Indiana; I
know and have always heard her loveline&s;s is beyond
all compari&s;on. I have no more, therefore, thought
of envying it, than of envying the brightne&s;s of the
&s;un. I knew, too, I bore no competition with my
&s;i&s;ters; but I never dreamt of competition. I knew
I was not hand&s;ome, but I &s;uppo&s;ed many people
be&s;ides not hand&s;ome, and that I &s;hould pa&s;s with the
re&s;t; and I concluded the world to be full of people
who had been &s;ufferers as well as my&s;elf, by di&s;ea&s;e or
accident. The&s;e have been occa&s;ionally my pa&s;&s;ing
thoughts; but the &s;ubject never &s;eized my mind; I
never reflected upon it all, till abu&s;e, without pro|vocation,
all at once opened my eyes, and &s;hewed me
to my&s;elf! Bear with me, then, my father, in this
fir&s;t dawn of terrible conviction! Many have been
unfortunate,&mdash;but none unfortunate like me! Many
have met with evils&mdash;but who with an accumulation
like mine!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, extremely affected, embraced her
with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s: &startq;My dear, de&s;erving,
excellent child,&endq; he cried, &startq;what would I not en|dure,
what &s;acrifice not make, to &s;oothe this cruel
di&s;turbance, till time and your own under&s;tanding
can exert their powers?&endq; then, while &s;training her
to his brea&s;t with the fonde&s;t parental commi&s;eration,
the tears, with which his eyes were overflowing, be|dewed
her cheeks.</P>
<P>Eugenia felt them, and, &s;inking to the ground,
pre&s;&s;ed his knees. &startq;O my father,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;a
tear from your revered eyes afflicts me more than all
el&s;e! Let me not draw forth another, le&s;t I &s;hould
become not only unhappy, but guilty. Dry them
up, my deare&s;t father&mdash;let me ki&s;s them away.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tell me, then, my poor girl, you will &s;truggle
again&s;t this ineffectual &s;orrow! Tell me you will a&s;&s;ert
that fortitude which only waits for your exertion; and
tell me you will forgive the misjudging compa&s;&s;ion
which $eared to impre&s;s you earlier with pain!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="174">
&startq;I will do all, every thing you de&s;ire! my inju&s;|tice
is &s;ubdued! my complaints &s;hall be hu&s;hed! you
have conquered me, my beloved father! Your in|dulgence,
your le$ity &s;hall take place of every hard|&s;hip,
and leave me nothing but filial affection!&endq;</P>
<P>Seizing this grateful moment, he then required of
her to relinqui&s;h her melancholy &s;cheme of &s;eclu&s;ion
from the world: &startq;The &s;hyne&s;s and the fears which
gave birth to it,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;will but grow upon you
if li&s;tened to; and they are not worthy the courage
I would in&s;til into your bo&s;om&mdash;the courage, my Eu|genia,
of virtue&mdash;the courage to pa&s;s by, as if un|heard,
the in&s;olence of the hard-hearted, and igno|rance
of the vulgar. Happine&s;s is in your power,
though beauty is not; and on that to &s;et too high a
value would be pardonable only in a weak and frivo|lous
mind; &s;ince, whatever is the involuntary admi|ration
with which it meets, every e&s;timable quality
and accompli&s;hment is attainable without it: and
though, which I cannot deny, its immediate influ|ence
is univer&s;al, yet in every competition and in
every deci&s;ion of e&s;teem, the &s;uperior, the elegant,
the better part of mankind give their &s;uffrages to
merit alone. And you, in particular, will find your|&s;elf,
through life, rather the more than the le&s;s va|lued,
by every mind capable of ju&s;tice and compa&s;|&s;ion,
for misfortunes which no guilt has-incurred.&endq;</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving her now to be &s;oftened, though not ab|&s;olutely
con&s;oled, he rang the bell, and begged the
&s;ervant, who an&s;wered it, to reque&s;t his brother
would order the coach immediately, as he was ob|liged
to return home; &startq;And you, my love,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;&s;hall accompany me; it will be the lea&s;t exer|tion
you can make in fir&s;t breaking through your
aver&s;ene&s;s to quit the hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia would not re&s;i&s;t; but her compliance was
evidently repugnant to her inclination; and in $word$
to the gla&s;s to put on her hat, &s;he turned a&s;ide from
it in &s;huddering, and hid her face with both her
hands.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="175">
&startq;My deare&s;t child,&endq; cried Mr. Tyrold, wrapping
her again in his arms, &startq;this &s;trong &s;u&s;ceptibility will
&s;oon wear away; but you cannot be too &s;peedy nor
too firm in re&s;i&s;ting it. The omi&s;&s;ion of what never
was in our power cannot cau&s;e remor&s;e, and the be|wailing
what never can become in our power cannot
afford comfort. Imagine but what would have been
the fate of Indiana, had your &s;ituations been rever&s;ed,
and had &s;he, who can never acquire your capacity,
and therefore never attain your knowledge, lo&s;t that
beauty which is her all; but which to you, even if
retained, could have been but a &s;econdary gift. How
&s;hort will be the reign of that all! how u&s;ele&s;s in
&s;ickne&s;s! how unavailing in &s;olitude! how inade|quate
to long life! how forgotten, or repiningly re|membered
in old age! You will live to feel pity for
all you now covet and admire; to grow &s;en&s;ible to a
lot more la&s;tingly happy in your own acquirements
and powers; and to exclaim, with contrition and
wonder. Time was when I would have changed with
the poor mind-dependent Indiana!&endq;</P>
<P>The carriage was now announced; Eugenia, with
reluctant &s;teps, de&s;cended; Camilla was called to
join them, and Sir Hugh &s;aw them &s;et off with the
utmo&s;t delight.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="41" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XLI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Strictures on Beauty.</HEAD>
<P>TO lengthen the airing, Mr. Tyrold ordered the
carriage by a new road; and to induce Eugenia to
break yet another &s;pell, in walking as well as riding,
he propo&s;ed their alighting, when they came to a
lane, and leaving the coach in waiting while they
took a &s;hort &s;troll.</P>
<P>He walked between his daughters a con&s;iderable
way, pa&s;&s;ing, wherever it was po&s;&s;ible, clo&s;e to cot|tages,
<PB N="367" REF="176">
labourers, and children. Eugenia &s;ubmitted
with a &s;igh, but held down her head, affrighted at
every fre&s;h object they encountered, till, upon ap|proaching
a &s;mall mi&s;erable hut, at the door of which
&s;everal children were playing, an unlucky boy called
out, &startq;O come! come! look!&mdash;here's the little
hump-back gentlewoman!&endq;</P>
<P>She then, clinging to her father, could not &s;tir
another &s;tep, and ca&s;t upon him a look of appeal
and reproach that almo&s;t over&s;et him; but, after
&s;peaking to her &s;ome words of kindne&s;s, he urged
her to go on, and alone, &s;aying, &startq;Throw only a
&s;hilling to the &s;en&s;ele&s;s little crew, and let Camilla
follow and give nothing, and &s;ee which will become
the mo&s;t popular.&endq;</P>
<P>They both obeyed, Eugenia fearfully and with
quickne&s;s ca&s;ting among&s;t them &s;ome &s;ilver, and Ca|milla
quietly walking on.</P>
<P>&startq;O, I have got a &s;ixpence!&endq; cried one; &startq;and
I've got a &s;hilling!&endq; &s;aid another; while the mother
of the little tribe came from her wa&s;h tub, and called
out, &startq;God ble&s;s your lady&s;hip!&endq; and the father
quitted a little garden at the &s;ide of his cottage, to
bow$ down to the ground, and cry, &startq;Heaven re|ward
you, good madam! you'll have a ble&s;&s;ing go
with you, go where you will!&endq;</P>
<P>The children then, dancing up to Camilla, begged
her charity; but when, &s;econding the palpable in|tention
of her father, &s;he &s;aid &s;he had nothing for
them, they looked highly di&s;&s;atisfied, while they re|doubled
their ble&s;&s;ings to Eugenia.</P>
<P>&startq;See, my child,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold, now joining
them, &startq;how cheaply preference, and even flattery,
may be purcha&s;ed!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Sir!&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, recovered from her
terror, yet deep in reflection, &startq;this is only by bri|bery,
and gro&s;s bribery, too! And what plea&s;ure, or
what confidence can accrue from preference &s;o earned!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The means, my dear Eugenia, are not beneath
the objects: if it is only from tho&s;e who unite na|tive
hardne&s;s with uncultured minds and manners,
<PB N="368" REF="177">
that civility is to be obtained by &s;uch &s;ordid materials,
remember, al&s;o, it is from &s;uch only it can ever fail
you. In the lowe&s;t life, equally with the highe&s;t,
wherever nature has been kind, &s;ympathy &s;prings
&s;pontaneou&s;ly for whatever is unfortunate, and re|&s;pect
for whatever &s;eems innocent. Steel your&s;elf,
then, firmly to with&s;tand attacks from the cruel and
unfeeling, and re&s;t perfectly &s;ecure you will have none
other to apprehend.&endq;</P>
<P>The clear and excellent capacity of Eugenia, com|prehended
in this le&s;&s;on, and its illu&s;tration, all the
&s;atisfaction Mr. Tyrold hoped to impart! and &s;he
was ruminating upon it with abated de&s;pondence,
when, as they came to a &s;mall hou&s;e, &s;urrounded with
a high wall, Mr. Tyrold, looking through an iron
gate at a female figure who &s;tood at one of the win|dows,
exclaimed&mdash;&startq;What a beautiful creature! I
have rarely, I think &s;een a more perfect face.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia felt &s;o much hurt by this untimely &s;ight,
that, after a &s;ingle glance, which confirmed the truth
of what he &s;aid, &s;he bent her eyes another way;
while Camilla her&s;elf was a&s;toni&s;hed that her kind
father &s;hould call their attention to beauty, at &s;o &s;ore
and critical a juncture.</P>
<P>&startq;The examination of a fine picture,&endq; &s;aid he,
fixing his eyes upon the window, and &s;tanding &s;till at
the iron gate, &startq;is a con&s;tant as well as exqui&s;ite plea|&s;ure;
for we look at it with an internal &s;ecurity, that
&s;uch as it appears to us to-day, it will appear again
to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow; but in
the plea&s;ure given by the examination of a fine face,
there is always, to a contemplative mind, &s;ome little
mixture of pain; an idea of its fragility &s;teals upon
our admiration, and blends with it &s;omething like
&s;olicitude; the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s how &s;hort a time we
can view it perfect, how quickly its brilliancy of
bloom will be blown, and how ultimately it will be
nothing.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You would have me, Sir,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, now
rai&s;ing her eyes, &startq;learn to &s;ee beauty with uncon|cern,
by depreciating its value? I feel your kind in|tention,
<PB N="369" REF="178">
but it does not come home to me; rea&s;on|ing
&s;uch as this may be equally applicable to any
thing el&s;e, and degrade whatever is de&s;irable into in|&s;ignificance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, my dear child, there is nothing, either in
its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or its lo&s;s, that can be compared with
beauty; nothing &s;o evane&s;cent, and nothing that
leaves behind it a contra&s;t which impre&s;&s;es &s;uch regret.
It cannot be forgotten, &s;ince the &s;ame features &s;till
remain, though they are robbed of their effect upon
the beholder; the &s;ame complexion is there, though
faded into a tint bearing no re&s;emblance with its ori|ginal
&s;tate; and the &s;ame eyes pre&s;ent them&s;elves to
the view, though bereft of all the lu&s;tre that had
rendered them captivating.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Sir! this is an argument but formed for
the moment. Is not the lo&s;s of youth the &s;ame to every
body? and is not age equally unwelcome to the ugly
and to the hand&s;ome?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For activity, for &s;trength, and for purpo&s;es of
u&s;e, certainly, my dear girl, there can be no differ|ence;
but for motives to mental regret, there can be
no compari&s;on. To tho&s;e who are commonly mould|ed,
the gradual growth of decay brings with it its
gradual endurance, becau&s;e little is mi&s;&s;ed from day
to day; hope is not roughly chilled, nor expectation
rudely bla&s;ted; they &s;ee their friends, their connec|tions,
their contemporaries, declining by the &s;ame
laws, and they yield to the immutable and general lot
rather imperceptibly than re&s;ignedly; but it is not &s;o
with the beauty! her lo&s;s is not only general, but pe|culiar;
and it is the peculiar, not the general evil,
that con&s;titutes all hard&s;hip. Health, &s;trength, agi|lity,
and animal &s;pirits, &s;he may &s;orrowing feel di|mini&s;h;
but &s;he hears every one complain of &s;imilar
failures, and &s;he mi&s;&s;es them unmurmuring, though
not unlamenting; but of beauty, every declen&s;ion i$
marked with &s;omething painful to &s;elf-love. The
change manife&s;ted by the mirror might patiently be
horne; but the change manife&s;ted in the eyes of
<PB N="370" REF="179">
every beholder; gives a &s;hock that does violence to
every pri&s;tine feeling.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This may certainly, Sir, be cruel; trying at
lea&s;t; but then,&mdash;what a youth has &s;he fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed!
Mortification comes upon her, at lea&s;t, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;
&s;he does not begin the world with it,&mdash;a &s;tranger at
all periods to any thing happier!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my child! the happine&s;s cau&s;ed by per&s;onal
attractions pays a dear after-price! The &s;oldier who
enters the field of battle requires not more courage,
though of a different nature, than the faded beauty
who enters an a&s;&s;embly room. To be wholly di&s;re|garded,
after engaging every eye; to be una&s;&s;i&s;ted,
after being habituated to &s;eeing crowds anxiou&s;ly offer
their &s;ervices; to be unheard, after monopoli&s;ing
every ear&mdash;can you, indeed, per&s;uade your&s;elf a
change &s;uch as this demands but ordinary firmne&s;s?
Yet the altered female who calls for it, has the lea&s;t
chance to obtain it; for even where nature has en|dowed
her with fortitude, the world and its flatteries
have almo&s;t uniformly enervated it, before the &s;ea&s;on
of its exertion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All this may be true,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, with a
&s;igh; &startq;and to me, however &s;ad in it&s;elf, it may
prove con&s;olatory; and yet&mdash;forgive my &s;incerity,
when I own&mdash;I would purcha&s;e a better appearance
at any price, any expence, any payment, the world
could impo&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was preparing an an&s;wer, when the
door of the hou&s;e, which he had &s;till continued fac|ing,
was opened, and the beautiful figure, which
had for &s;ome time retired from the window, ru&s;hed
&s;uddenly upon a lawn before the gate again&s;t which
they were leaning.</P>
<P>Not &s;eeing them, &s;he &s;at down upon the gra&s;s,
which &s;he plucked up by hands full, and &s;trewed over
her fine flowing hair.</P>
<P>Camilla, fearing they &s;hould &s;eem impertinent,
would have retreated; but Eugenia, much &s;truck,
&s;adly, yet with earne&s;tne&s;s, compelled her&s;elf to re|gard
the object before her, who was young, fair, of
<PB N="371" REF="180">
a tall and &s;triking figure, with features delicately re|gular.</P>
<P>A &s;igh, not to be checked, acknowledged how
little either rea&s;oning or eloquence could &s;ubdue a
wi&s;h to re&s;emble &s;uch an appearance, when the young
per&s;on, flinging her&s;elf &s;uddenly upon her face, threw
her white arms over her head, and &s;obbed aloud with
violence.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed, and deeply concerned, Eugenia inter|nally
&s;aid, alas! what a world is this! even beauty
&s;o exqui&s;ite, without waiting for age or change, may
be thus mi&s;erable!</P>
<P>She feared to &s;peak, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be heard; but
&s;he looked up to her father, with an eye that &s;poke
conce&s;&s;ion, and with an intere&s;t for the fair afflicted,
which &s;eemed to reque&s;t his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>He motioned to her to be quiet; when the young
per&s;on, abruptly half ri&s;ing, bur&s;t into a fit of loud,
&s;hrill, and di&s;cordant laughter.</P>
<P>Eugenia now, utterly confounded, would have
drawn her father away; but he was intently engaged
in his ob&s;ervations, and &s;teadily kept his place.</P>
<P>In two minutes, the laugh cea&s;ed all at once, and
the young creature, ha&s;tily ri&s;ing, began turning
round with a velocity that no machine could have ex|ceeded.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters now fearfully interchanged looks that
&s;hewed they thought her mad, and both endeavoured
to draw Mr. Tyrold from the gate, but in vain; he
made them hold by his arms, and &s;tood &s;till.</P>
<P>Without &s;eeming giddy, &s;he next began to jump;
and he now could only detain his daughters, by &s;hew|ing
them the gate, at which they &s;tood, was locked.</P>
<P>In another minute, &s;he perceived them, and, com|ing
eagerly forward, dropt &s;everal low courte&s;ies, &s;ay|ing,
at every fre&s;h bend&mdash;&startq;Good day!&mdash;Good
day!&mdash;Good day!&endq;</P>
<P>Equally trembling, they now both turned pale
with fear; but Mr. Tyrold, who was &s;till immov|able,
an&s;wered her by a bow, and a&s;ked if &s;he were
well.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="181">
&startq;Give me a &s;hilling!&endq; was her reply, while the
&s;laver drivelled unre&s;trained from her mouth, render|ing
utterly di&s;gu&s;ting a chin that a &s;tatuary might
have wi&s;hed to model.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you live at this hou&s;e?&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, plea&s;e&mdash;yes, plea&s;e&mdash;yes, plea&s;e,&endq; &s;he an|&s;wered,
twenty times following, and almo&s;t black in
the face before &s;he would allow her&s;elf to take another
breath.</P>
<P>A cat now appearing at the door, &s;he &s;eized it,
and tried to twine it round her neck with great fond|ling,
wholly unre&s;i&s;ting the &s;cratches which tore her
fine &s;kin.</P>
<P>Next, capering forward with it towards the gate,
&startq;Look! look!&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;here's pu&s;s!&mdash;here's
pu&s;s!&mdash;here's pu&s;s!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Then, letting it fall, &s;he tore her handkerchief
off her neck, put it over her face, &s;trained it as tight
as &s;he was able, and tied it under her chin; and then
&s;truck her head with both her hands, making a noi&s;e
that re&s;embled nothing human.</P>
<P>&startq;Take, take me away, my father!&endq; cried Eu|genia,
&startq;I &s;ee, I feel your awful le&s;&s;on! but impre&s;s
it no further, le&s;t I &s;hould die in receiving it!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold immediately moved off without &s;peak|ing;
Camilla, penetrated for her &s;i&s;ter, ob&s;erved the
&s;ame &s;ilence; and Eugenia, hanging upon her father,
and ab&s;orbed in profound rumination, only by the
depth of her &s;ighs made her exi&s;tence known; and
thus, without the interchange of a word, &s;lowly and
pen&s;ively they walked back to the carriage.</P>
<P>Eugenia broke the &s;ilence as &s;oon as they were
&s;eated: &startq;O, my father!&endq; &s;he exclaimed, &startq;what a
&s;ight have you made me witne&s;s! how dread a re|proof
have you given to my repining &s;pirit! Did
you know this unhappy beauty was at that hou&s;e?
Did you lead me thither purpo&s;ely to di&s;play to me
her &s;hocking imbecility?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Relying upon the excellence of your under|&s;tanding,
I ventured upon an experiment more pow|erful,
I well knew, than all that rea&s;on could urge;
<PB N="373" REF="182">
an experiment not only &s;triking at the moment, but
which, by playing upon the imagination, as well as
convincing the judgment, mu&s;t make an impre&s;&s;ion
that can never be effaced. I have been informed, for
&s;ome time, that this poor girl was in our neighbour|hood;
&s;he was born an ideot, and therefore, having
never known brighter days, is in&s;en&s;ible to her ter|rible
&s;tate. Her friends are opulent, and that hou&s;e
is taken, and a woman is paid, to keep her in exi&s;t|ence
and in ob&s;curity. I had heard of her uncom|mon
beauty, and when the news reached me of my
dear Eugenia's di&s;tre&s;s, the idea of this meeting oc|curred
to me; I rode to the hou&s;e, and engaged the
woman to detain her unfortunate charge at the win|dow
till we appeared, and then to let her loo&s;e into
the garden. Poor, ill fated young creature! it has
been, indeed, a melancholy &s;ight.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A &s;ight,&endq; cried Eugenia, &startq;to come home to
me with &s;hame!&mdash;O, my dear Father! your pre|&s;cription
&s;trikes to the root of my di&s;ea&s;e!&mdash;&s;hall I
ever again dare murmur!&mdash;will any egoti&s;m ever
again make me believe no lot &s;o haple&s;s as my own!
I will think of her when I am di&s;contented; I will
call to my mind this &s;pectacle of human degradation
&mdash;and &s;ubmit, at lea&s;t with calmne&s;s, to my lighter
evils and milder fate.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My excellent child! this is ju&s;t what I expected
from the candour of your temper, and the rectitude
of your &s;entiments. You have &s;een, here, the value
of intellects in viewing the horrour of their lo&s;s; and
you have witne&s;&s;ed, that beauty, without mind, is
more dreadful than any deformity. You have &s;eized
my application, and left me nothing to enforce; my
dear, my excellent child! you have left for your fond
Father nothing but tender approbation. With the
utmo&s;t thankfulne&s;s to Providence, I have marked
from your earlie&s;t childhood, the native ju&s;tne&s;s of
your under&s;tanding; which, with your &s;tudious in|clination
to &s;edentary accompli&s;hments, has proved a
reviving $ource of con&s;olation to your mother and to
me, for the cruel accidents we have ince&s;&s;antly la|mented.
<PB N="374" REF="183">
How will that admirable mother rejoice in
the recital I have to make to her! What pride will
&s;he take in a daughter &s;o worthily her own, &s;o re|&s;embling
her in noblene&s;s of nature, and a &s;uperior
way of thinking! Her tears, my child, like mine,
will thank you for your exertions! &s;he will &s;train you
to her fond bo&s;om, as your father &s;trains you at this
moment!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, Sir,&endq; cried Eugenia, &startq;your kind ta&s;k is
now completed with your vanqui&s;hed Eugenia! her
thoughts, her occupations, her happine&s;s, &s;hall hence|forth
all be centered in filial gratitude and content|ment.&endq;</P>
<P>The affectionate Camilla, throwing her arms about
them both, bathed each with the tears of joy and
admiration, which this &s;oothing conclu&s;ion to an ad|venture
&s;o &s;evere excited.</P>
