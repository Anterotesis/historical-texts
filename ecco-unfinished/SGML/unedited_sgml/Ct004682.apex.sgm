<P>The mo&s;t agreeable in the world, child! a new acquaintance.</P>

<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what quality is &s;he, then?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much too high quality for your ac|quaintance, I promi&s;e you. What! a poet-man! that &s;its write, write, write, all day long, &s;cribbling a pack of non&s;en&s;e for the news-papers!&mdash;You're fit for nothing above a chambermaid.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, not I, Sir. Neither my lady nor I will have any thing to &s;ay to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your mi&s;tre&s;s and you both give your|&s;elves a great many airs, my dear. Your poverty, I think, might pull down your pride.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does the fellow mean by poverty?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean that you are &s;tarving.</P>

<P>Well; &s;he lives privately, indeed, be|cau&s;e &s;he loves retirement; &s;he goes plain, be|cau&s;e &s;he hates dre&s;s; &s;he keeps no table, becau&s;e &s;he is an enemy to luxury.&mdash;In &s;hort, my lady is as rich as a Jew, and you are an impertinent cox|comb.</P>

<P>Come, come! I know more of your mi&s;tre&s;s than you imagine.</P>

<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be?</P>

<SP>

<P>No, Sir, there is nothing at all; nothing that &s;ignifies to you or any body el&s;e.</P>

<P>Nay, no my&s;teries between you and me, child! Come; here's the key to all locks, the clue to every maze, and the di&s;clo&s;er of all &s;e|crets; money, child! Here! take this pur&s;e; you &s;ee I know &s;omething; tell me the re&s;t, and I have the fellow to it in my pocket.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! poor Mr. Spatter! Where could you get all this money, I wonder! Not by your poetries, I believe. But what &s;ignifies tel|ling you any thing, when you are acquainted with our whole hi&s;tory already? You have corre&s;pon|dence every where, you know. There, Sir! take up your filthy pur&s;e again, and remember that I &s;corn to be obliged to any body but my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's impudence for you! when to my certain knowledge your mi&s;tre&s;s has not a guinea in the world; you live in continual fear of being di&s;covered; and you will both be utterly undone in a fortnight, unle&s;s Lord Falbridge &s;hould pre|vent it, by taking Amelia under his protection.

<STAGE>Enter Mrs. <HI>Goodman.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Oh! your &s;ervant, Mrs. Goodman! Your's is the mo&s;t un&s;ociable lodging-hou&s;e in town. So many ladies, and only one gentleman! and you won't take the lea&s;t notice of him.</P>

<P>Why, did not you promi&s;e to introduce me to Amelia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you the plain truth, Mr. Spatter, &s;he don't like you. And, indeed, I don't know how it is, but you make your&s;elf a great many enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I believe I do rai&s;e a little envy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed y$$ $re mi&s;taken, Sir. As you are a lodger of mine, it makes me quite un|ea&s;y to hear what the world &s;ays of you. How do you contrive to make &s;o many enemies, Mr. Spatter?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e I have merit, Mrs. Goodman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be &s;o; but nobody will allow it but your&s;elf. They &s;ay that you &s;et up for a wit, indeed; but that you deal in nothing but &s;candal, and think of nothing but mi&s;chief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do &s;peak ill of the men &s;ometimes, to be &s;ure; but then I have a great regard for wo|men&mdash;provided they are hand&s;ome: and that I may give you a proof of it, introduce me to Amelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t excu&s;e me; &s;he and you would be the wor&s;t company in the world; for &s;he never &s;peaks too well of her&s;elf, nor the lea&s;t ill of any body el&s;e. And then her virtue&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh, pooh, &s;he &s;peaks ill of nobody, becau&s;e &s;he knows nobody; and as for her virtue, ha, ha!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't believe much in that, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not over-much faith, Mrs. Good|man. Lord Falbridge, perhaps, may give a bet|ter account of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Falbridge can &s;ay nothing but what would be extremely to her honour, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir. <STAGE>[Spatter <HI>laughs.]</HI></STAGE> Well, well, you may laugh, but it is very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I don't doubt it; but you don't tell the whole truth, Mrs. Goodman. When any of your friends or acquaintance &s;it for their pictures, you draw a very flattering likene&s;s. All charac|ters have their dark &s;ide, and if they have but one eye, you give them in <HI>profile.</HI> Your great friend,

Mr. Freeport, for in&s;tan$$ whom you are always prai&s;ing for his benevolent actions&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is benevolence it&s;elf, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and gro&s;&s;ne&s;s it&s;elf too. I remember him the&s;e many years. He always cancels an ob|ligation by the manner of conferring it; and does you a favour, as if he were going to knock you down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce with your &s;atire, good M$. Spatter! Mr. Freeport is my be&s;t friend; I owe him every thing; and I can't endure the &s;lighte&s;t reflection on his character. Be&s;ides, he can have given no offence to Lady Alton, whatever may be the ca&s;e with Amelia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Alton! &s;he is a particular friend of mine to be &s;ure; but between you and me, Mrs. Goodman, a more ridiculous character than any you have mentioned. A <HI>bel e&s;prit</HI> for&s;ooth! and as vain of her beauty as learning, without any great portion of either. A fourth Grace, and a tenth Mu&s;e! who fancies her&s;elf enamour'd of Lord Falbridge, becau&s;e &s;he would be proud of &s;uch a conque&s;t; and has lately be&s;towed &s;ome marks of di&s;tinction on me, becau&s;e &s;he thinks it will give her credit among per&s;ons of letters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you can't &s;pare your own friends, I don't wonder at your attacking mine&mdash;and &s;o, Sir, your humble &s;ervant.&mdash;But &s;tay! here's a po&s;t-chai&s;e &s;topp'd at our door; and here comes a &s;ervant with a portmanteau!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord Brumpton dead! the only friend I had remaining in England; the only per|&s;on, on who&s;e interce&s;&s;ion I relied for my pardon. Cruel fortune! I have now no hope but to find my daughter. Tell me, Owen; have you been able to hear any tidings of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, Sir, none that are &s;atisfactory. On the death of Mr. Andrews, in who&s;e care you left her, being cruelly abandoned by the relation who &s;ucceeded to the e&s;tate, &s;he left the country &s;ome months ago, and has not &s;ince been heard of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unhappy there too! When will the mea&s;ure of my misfortunes be full? When will the malice of my fate be &s;atisfied? Pro&s;cribed, condemned, attainted, (alas, but too ju&s;tly!) I have lo&s;t my rank, my e&s;tate, my wife, my &s;on, and all my family. One only daughter remains. Perhaps a wretched wanderer like my&s;elf, perhaps in the extreme&s;t indigence, perhaps di&s;honoured&mdash;Ha! that thought di&s;tracts me.</P>

<P>My dear ma&s;ter, have patience! Do not be ingenious to torment your&s;elf, but con&s;ult your &s;afety, and prepare for your departure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Owen. Hearing, providentially, of the death of my friend Andrews, paternal care and tenderne&s;s drew me hither; and I will not
<PB N="11" REF="16">
quit the kingdom till I learn &s;omething of my child, my dear Amelia, whom I left a tender in|nocent in the arms of the be&s;t of women twenty years ago. Her &s;ex demands protection; and &s;he is now of an age, in which &s;he is more expo&s;ed to misfortunes than even in helple&s;s infancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Be advi&s;ed; depart, and leave that care to me. Con&s;ider; your life is now at &s;take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>My life has been too mi&s;erable to ren|der me very &s;ollicitous for its pre&s;ervation&mdash;But the complection of the times is changed; the very name of the party, in which I was unhappily en|gaged, is extingui&s;hed, and the whole nation is unanimou&s;ly devoted to the throne. Di&s;loyalty and in&s;urrection are now no more, and the &s;word of ju&s;tice is &s;uffered to &s;leep. If I can find my child, and find her worthy of me, I will fly with her to take refuge in &s;ome foreign country; if I am di&s;covered in the &s;earch, I have &s;till &s;ome hopes of mercy.</P>

<P>Words, words, Mr. Spatter! You have been witne&s;s of Lord Falbridge's incon&s;tancy. A perfidious man! Fal&s;e as Phaon to Sappho, or Ja&s;on to Medea!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have taken every po&s;&s;ible method to de|tect her. I have watched Amelia her&s;elf like a $ailiff, or a Duenna; I have overheard private

<P>Good creature! my be&s;t Spatter! And what? what have you di&s;covered?</P>

<P>That Amelia is a native of Scotland; that her &s;urname <HI>Walton</HI> is probably not real, but a&s;|&s;umed; and that &s;he earne&s;tly wi&s;hes to conceal both the place of her birth and her family.</P>

<P>It is no &s;uch thing: you don't &s;peak the truth; and that is wor&s;e than being proud. I know very well that you are as poor as Job, that you are in want of common nece&s;&s;aries, and don't make a good meal above once in a fortnight.</P>

<P>In two words then, Sir William, this happy event is chiefly owing to your old friend, the late Lord Brumpton.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Brumpton!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; hone&s;t Owen there told me, that
<PB N="67" REF="72">
his Lord&s;hip had been employed in &s;olliciting your pardon. Did not you, Owen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Owen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Free.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon hearing that, and perceiving the danger you were in, I went immediately to the pre&s;ent Lord Brumpton; who is a very hone&s;t fel|low, and one of the olde&s;t acquaintance I have in the world. He, at my in&s;tance, immediately made the nece&s;&s;ary application; and gue&s;s how agree|ably we were &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that the late Lord had already been &s;ucce&s;sful, and that the pardon had been made out, on the very morning of the day his Lord&s;hip died. Away went I, as fa&s;t as a pair of hor&s;es could carry me, to fetch it; and &s;hould cer|tainly have prevented this la&s;t arre&s;t, if the warrant to apprehend you, as dangerous per&s;ons, had not if|&s;ued under your a&s;&s;umed names of William Ford and Amelia Walton, again&s;t whom the information had been laid. But, however, it has only &s;erved to prevent your running away, when the danger was over, for at pre&s;ent, Sir William, thank heaven and his maje&s;ty, you are a whole man again; and you have nothing to do but to make a legal appearance, and to plead the pardon I have brought you, to ab&s;olve you from all informa|tions.</P>

<P>Ay, I heard that your Lord&s;hip had been bu&s;y.&mdash;You had more friends at Court than one, Sir William, I promi&s;e you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am overwhelmed with my &s;udden good fortune, and am poor even in thanks. Teach me, Mr. Freeport, teach me how to make &s;ome acknowledgement for your extraordinary genero|&s;ity!</P>

<P>I'll tell you what, Sir William. Not|with&s;tanding your daughter's pride, I took a liking to her, the moment I &s;aw her.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing. Go on, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why then, to confe&s;s the truth, I am afraid that my benevolence, which you have all been plea&s;ed to prai&s;e &s;o highly, had &s;ome little leaven of &s;elf-intere&s;t in it; and I was de&s;irous to promote Amelia's happine&s;s more ways than one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am the verie&s;t wretch that ever exi&s;ted.&mdash;But take her, Sir! for I mu&s;t confe&s;s that you have de&s;erved her by your proceedings; and that I, fool and villain that I was, have for|feited her by mine. <STAGE>[going.</STAGE></P>

<P>Hold, hold! one word before you go, if you plea&s;e, my Lord! You may kill your&s;elf for aught I know, but you &s;han't lay your death at my door, I promi&s;e you. I had a kindne&s;s for A|melia, I mu&s;t confe&s;s; but in the cour&s;e of my late negotiation for Sir William, hearing of your Lord&s;hip's preten&s;ions, I dropt all thoughts of her. It is a maxim with me, to do good wherever I can, but always to ab&s;tain from doing mi&s;chief.&mdash;Now as I can't make the lady happy my&s;elf, I would fain put her into the hands of tho&s;e that can.&mdash;So, if you would oblige me, Sir William, let me join the&s;e two young folks together, <STAGE>[join|ing their hands]</STAGE> and do you &s;ay Amen to it.</P>

<P>Your actions this day, and your &s;olicitude for my father, have redeemed you in my good opi|nion;
<PB N="69" REF="74">
and the con&s;ent of Sir William, &s;econded by &s;o powerful an advocate as Mr. Freeport, can|not be contended with. Take my hand, my Lord! a virtuous pa&s;&s;ion may inhabit the pure&s;t brea&s;t; and I am not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, that I had conceived a partiality for you, till your own conduct turned my heart again&s;t you; and if my re&s;entment has given you any pain, when I con&s;i|der the occa&s;ion, I mu&s;t own that I cannot repent it.</P>
