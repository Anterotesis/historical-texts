<P>THE following Trifle is not a Tran&s;la|tion from the French, nor any other Lan|guage:&mdash;I have an exclu&s;ive right to all it's imperfections.</P>
<P>I am far from endeavouring to vitiate the ta&s;te of the Town, and over-run the Stage with Romance, and Legends:&mdash;but Engli&s;h Children, both old and young, are di&s;appointed without a Pantomime, at Chri&s;tmas;&mdash;and, a Pantomime not being forth-coming, in Drury-Lane, I was pre|vail'd upon to make out the &s;ub&s;equent Sketch, expre&s;sly for that &s;ea&s;on, to &s;up|ply the place of Harlequinade:&mdash;Acci|dents, however, retarded it's repre&s;enta|tion, a fortnight beyond it's intended ap|pearance.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">I feel nothing upon my con&s;cience in having &s;ub&s;tituted a Blue Beard for a Black Face.&mdash;I have not attempted to make Magick u&s;urp that &s;pace of the Eve|ning's Entertainment much better occu|pied by Dramas of in&s;truction, and pro|bability. I have kept my Enchantment within the limits where rational minds, without pedantry, have not only long to|lerated it, but have found plea&s;ure in un|bending with it, after they have been more &s;olidly engaged. In &s;hort my Syllabub does not make it's appearance until the &s;ub&s;tan|tial part of the repa&s;t is over.&mdash;I am care|le&s;s, therefore, of tho&s;e &s;apient Gentle|men, who, in the words of <HI>Gre&s;&s;et</HI>,
<Q><L>"Port$nt leur petite &s;entence"</L>
<L>"Sur la rime, &amp; &s;ur les Auteurs,"</L>
<L>"Adec autant de connoi&s;sance"</L>
<L>"Qu'un aveugle en a des couleurs."</L></Q>
But, I could tell &s;uch Gentlemen that I have done &s;ome good.&mdash;I have given an
<PB N="v" REF="4">
opportunity to Mr. KELLY of fully e&s;ta|bli&s;hing his reputation, as a Mu&s;ical Com|po&s;er, with a Publick, who&s;e favour he has long, and de&s;ervedly experienced as a Singer. Crowded audiences have te&s;ti|fied the mo&s;t &s;trong, and decided appro|bation of his original Mu&s;ick, in <HI>Blue-Beard</HI>; and amply applauded his ta&s;te, and judgment, in Selection.</P>
<P>Dully as the matter of fact may be &s;ta|ted, I feel gratified in relating this Trui&s;m of a worthy and indu&s;trious man.</P>
<P>Add to this, I have brought forward <HI>Young Greenwood</HI> (a Scene-Painter of Nine|teen!) to &s;hew De&s;ign, and Execution of uncommon promi&s;e:&mdash;</P>
<P>And <HI>John&s;tone</HI>, a <HI>cla&s;sical</HI> Machini&s;t, (a <HI>rara avis</HI>, alas! in Theatres) has added another wreath to his well-earn'd laurels.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">I have made the Dialogue and Songs (&s;uch as they are) &s;ub&s;ervient to the above-mention'd Arti&s;ts:&mdash;and, no men, &s;urely, ever made better u&s;e of a vehicle.</P>
<P>I have only, now, to &s;ay that I heartily thank the Performers for the kind, and zealous exertions, of their well-known ta|lents:&mdash;and that it would be as ungrateful as impudent to deny that I took the out|line of my Story from the works of the ce|lebrated Mrs. GOOSE:&mdash;at who&s;e feet with all due deference I beg to lay my pre&s;ent weighty labour;&mdash;and I do hereby in&s;cribe to her the Grand Dramatick Romance of <HI>Blue-Beard</HI>.</P>
