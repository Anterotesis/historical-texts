<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HEROISM, (&s;ometimes called <HI>Quixoti&s;m)</HI> is at pre&s;ent &s;o general all over <HI>Europe,</HI> and in &s;ome more di&s;tant Parts, that I believe no one will be &s;ur|priz'd if the Epidemic Di&s;order has reach'd the Stage; which, as it is allow'd to be often the Repre&s;entation of High-Life, and more liable to traffick with the Clouds, than any other Branch of Literature, (<HI>Whitfieldi&s;m</HI> excepted) lies more open to the Contagion.</P>
<P>Under the Suppo&s;ition therefore of due Allowances from the Publick, and as a Relief from the <HI>more inten&s;e Af|fairs abroad,</HI> we have ventur'd to exhibit to the Town, the Plan of Operations between two <HI>Theatrical Gene|rals,</HI> who, tho' of different Kingdoms, and the Scene of Action laid at &s;ome Di&s;tance from us, will not we hope be di&s;regarded, nor their Affairs le&s;s intere&s;ting, or di|verting, than if it were nearer.</P>
<P>The one indeed has in this Kingdom, long been known a <HI>Heroe</HI> of great <HI>Pui&s;&s;ance</HI> and <HI>Magnanimity,</HI> not to be per&s;uaded from his Pur&s;uits of <HI>Glory</HI> by the Threats of private Whi&s;pers, or publick Manife&s;tos, nor daunted at the odds of <HI>Numbers</HI> in the <HI>Field</HI> of <HI>Action</HI>.</P>
<P>The other a <HI>younger General</HI> indeed, and le&s;s ex|perienc'd, not &s;o fierce in the <HI>Attack,</HI> nor <HI>QUITE</HI> &s;o formidable in the <HI>FRONT;</HI> yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Di&s;advantages, he is &s;aid to be Ma&s;ter of Qualifica|tions more commendable, <HI>viz.</HI> A Coolne&s;s at the On&s;et, a Warmth in the Retreat, and (what all prudent Gene|rals &s;hould have) a Di&s;po&s;ition rather to <HI>give Orders,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
for the Battle, than an Inclination to hazard his Per|&s;on in it&mdash;<HI>a great Example</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But they are both wrong'd in having their Charac|ters attempted by &s;o weak a Pen&mdash;Therefore, that we may not longer detain you, from what they &s;ay of, and to each Other, we think proper to clo&s;e this Prefa|tory Trifle, with informing you, that <HI>Dublin</HI> was the Seat of Action, the two Heroes Mr. <HI>THEOPHILUS CIBBER</HI> and Mr. <HI>THOMAS SHERIDAN;</HI> what Numbers fought under each Banner, how influenced, and how &s;pirited, will be &s;hewn in the following Pages.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;e of Quarrel indeed appears to have been about &s;o &s;mall a <HI>Trifle</HI> as a <HI>Robe</HI>&mdash;a <HI>Robe</HI> for <HI>Cato</HI>&mdash;Which had the <HI>Stoick</HI> lived he very freely would have given to either of them&mdash;But why do I call it a <HI>Trifle?</HI>&mdash;Look around, and &s;ee what <HI>Wars,</HI> what <HI>Deva&s;tations</HI> have en&s;ued from Matters of <HI>le&s;s Moment</HI>&mdash;Well; Mr. <HI>SHERIDAN</HI> being di&s;appointed of the Robe, he fir&s;t repre&s;ented the <HI>great Cato</HI> in, refu&s;ed to perform, whether from a Re&s;ent|ment of his being <HI>per&s;onally</HI> ill treated, or that he, in the Character of the <HI>divine Cato,</HI> would not appear in wor&s;e Cloaths than he did the Week before, the <HI>Conni&s;|&s;eurs</HI> are not yet agreed in. On his Refu&s;al <HI>GENERAL CIBBER</HI> propo&s;es to the Audience, to <HI>read, with their Leave,</HI> the Part of <HI>Cato,</HI> and at the &s;ame time, play his <HI>de&s;ign'd</HI> Part of <HI>Syphax</HI>&mdash;which he did&mdash; <HI>SHERIDAN</HI> &s;eems to re&s;ent his <HI>In&s;olence</HI> in <HI>attempting</HI> to play a Part of <HI>HIS,</HI> on which the Fire grows hot on both &s;ides, from which I beg leave to retire, being inclined to find out a &s;afer Situation, and give you, <HI>Reader,</HI> leave to enter the <HI>Trenches</HI> with all my Heart.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. SHERIDAN's Fir&s;t APOLOGY To the TOWN.</HEAD>
<P>I Am extremely concerned for the Occa|ca&s;ion of my addre&s;&s;ing you in this pub|lic Manner, but as the Di&s;appointment which you met with, at my not being able to perform, has given ri&s;e to &s;everal Stories very little in my Favour, I think it my Duty to clear up the Matter and ju&s;tify my&s;elf. The Fact is thus: When I went to the Play-hou&s;e, I found every thing in great Confu&s;ion, the People not paid and clamouring for their Money, the Mu&s;ick refu&s;ing to play unle&s;s their Arrears were di&s;charged, and an Ac|count
<PB N="4" REF="5">
brought at the &s;ame Time that Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> the Director and Manager of the whole had ab&s;conded. As I was dre&s;&s;ing for my Part, I found the Robe which I had be|fore worn in CATO was wanting; upon Enquiry, I heard, that, Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> had come two Days before and taken it from the Hou&s;e, I had &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe that he had done it purely to prevent my playing that Night; the Re&s;entment I conceived at &s;uch Treatment, the Concern I was under le&s;t the Audience &s;hould be di&s;appointed, &s;ome other ill U&s;age I received, and &s;everal other Inci|dents concurring (a Detail of which would take up too much Time) di&s;ordered me &s;o much, that it not only rendered me incapa|ble of doing Ju&s;tice to the Character I was to play, but likewi&s;e almo&s;t took away my Voice. You your&s;elves were Witne&s;&s;es of this, when I endeavoured to make an Apo|logy and could not be heard. And indeed I was in &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that had I been heard I &s;hould not have been under&s;tood. I appeal to any rea&s;onable Per&s;on then pre&s;ent, whe|ther it were better in the&s;e Circum&s;tances to di&s;mi&s;s the Hou&s;e, (which was my Intention) or to keep them purely to convince them, that it was not in my Power to get through one Speech of the Part. It has been &s;aid, that the want of a Robe was a trifling Thing, and that the Audience would have been con|tent to have received me in any Dre&s;s; they
<PB N="5" REF="6">
mu&s;t have but little Skill in Theatrical Af|fairs, who think a proper Habit is not ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. This was more particularly my Ca&s;e in this Character, as it is one for which I am naturally very unfit in my Per&s;on, and in which nothing could have made my Appearance &s;upportable, but a large Robe to cover my Defects, and give a Gravity and Dignity to my Per&s;on, which I wanted, and which are &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Cha|racter. I know when an Audience is di&s;ap|pointed, they often make but little Allow|ances for the Actor, they feel nothing of the Concern and Anxiety of Mind he labours un|der, when he has acquired a Reputation by performing a Character one Night, and &s;ees him&s;elf about to lo&s;e it in an other. But it was not that, nor the ill Treatment I had re|ceived, which hindred my playing, it was the Effect which all this had on me. I had &s;o much Deference for the Audience, and &s;o much Gratitude, nay, it was &s;o much my Duty, that I &s;hould have &s;acrificed all Regard to Character, and every other Con&s;ideration, to have done my utmo&s;t to have plea&s;ed them even in the meane&s;t Dre&s;s, had I not found that my Voice was quite gone, and that it was not in my Power to go through with one Scene. I was then reduced to this Difficulty, either to detain them, when I found I was not only incapable of giving them the Satis|faction they might expect, but mu&s;t have
<PB N="6" REF="7">
given them the highe&s;t Di&s;gu&s;t in my Per|formance, or el&s;e fairly to tell them, that it was not in my power to play. I cho&s;e the latter; if it was an Error, it is one I have paid dearly for, &s;ince to that Principle I &s;a|crificed above &s;ixty Pounds, which I ab&s;o|lutely lo&s;t by not playing. Such Per&s;ons as have a&s;&s;igned any other Cau&s;e for my not performing, if they can &s;uppo&s;e me either vain, or ungrateful, or even impudent enough to di&s;appoint an Audience meerly out of Whim or Humour, I hope will not think me Fool enough to &s;tand to &s;uch a Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>And now (tho' I have already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed too much on your Patience) I mu&s;t beg your In|dulgence a little farther, as I perhaps &s;hall not have another Opportunity of doing it, in per|mitting me to return you, and all the Ladies, and Gentlemen of this Kingdom, who have honoured the Plays, in which I performed, with their Pre&s;ence, my &s;incere and hearty Thanks for all your Favours. The Succe&s;s I have met with has been an additional Plea&s;ure to me, as by this means you have convinced the World how fal&s;e that Opinion is, which has prevailed among&s;t &s;ome, that the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> are kinder to Strangers than their own People. For your great Indulgence to me is a manife&s;t Proof, how willing you are to encou|rage the lea&s;t Dawn of Merit in one of your Country. Yet, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, your
<PB N="7" REF="8">
great Favour, and the prodigious Succe&s;s I have met with, have I find rai&s;ed me many Enemies, There are &s;ome People who cannot behold the Pro&s;perity of others, in any Way of Life, without Envy; and as I am con|&s;cious to my&s;elf, that I have by no Action of mine de&s;erved the Hatred of any Per&s;on, I mu&s;t believe I have no Enemies but &s;uch as my Succe&s;s has made &s;o. That I have &s;ome is manife&s;t from the Indu&s;try with which &s;ome People &s;pread Reports to my Di&s;advantage, and the Readine&s;s with which others believe them. My Gratitude to the Publick, the Friend&s;hip I have experienced in private, and the Love I have for my Country, would have detained me here much longer, (if I could in the lea&s;t have contributed to the publick En|tertainment,) in &s;pight of any Advantages I could have propo&s;ed to my&s;elf in another Kingdom. I &s;hould be &s;orry a few Snakes in the Gra&s;s &s;hould drive me from &s;o fair a Field; but it is a Misfortune in our Way of Life, that a few malicious People can do a Per&s;on more Injury in one Night, than the Friend&s;hip of the Publick in general can re|pair.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h that the Succe&s;s I have met with, be the means of rai&s;ing up &s;ome Genius more worthy to entertain you, but this I will venture to &s;ay, that you will never find any,

<SALUTE><HI>Mr.</HI> SHERIDAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR injudicious Di&s;appointment of the Company la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day</HI>, who ex|pected to &s;ee you in the Character of CATO, and your indi&s;creet Attempt to di&s;|mi&s;s the Audience, having, as you confe&s;s, become a Town-talk, and given ri&s;e to many idle Fal&s;hoods, meerly calculated to injure the innocent, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I relate the Fact, &s;trictly adhering to Truth. There
<PB N="10" REF="11">
were many Witne&s;&s;es of what I am about to declare; and I know none, except your&s;elf, who&s;e Memory is weak enough to forget it, or will be hardy enough to deny it.</P>
<P>When it drew near the Time proper to begin the Play, Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> and my&s;elf were alarm'd, in the Dre&s;&s;ing-room, with a Re|port, that you declared you would not play, becau&s;e you had not the &s;ame Robe you wore in that Character before; and that you &s;aid, <HI>The Audience mu&s;t be di&s;mi&s;s'd</HI>. This Rea|&s;on for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing an Audience, (propos'd by you who had no Right to di&s;mi&s;s them) ap|pear'd to me &s;o weak, I could not believe it, till you came into the Room, and &s;wore, <HI>Unle&s;s you had that Robe, you would not act</HI>. This Declaration I looked upon as a ra&s;h Expre&s;&s;ion, the meer Effect of your then ruffled Temper; but could not yet &s;uppo&s;e, you would proceed &s;o idly as you did: You were then compleatly dre&s;s'd from Head to Foot (as well as ever the Character was dre&s;s'd in any Theatre in <HI>Ireland</HI> or <HI>Eng|land</HI>) all but the Robe.</P>
<P>Upon Enquiry, it appeared, the Robes wore by <HI>Cato, Juba</HI> and <HI>Sempronius</HI>, the fir&s;t Night, were borrowed by <HI>Philips</HI>, of &s;ome Gentlewoman in this Town, who bought them in an Auction at <HI>London</HI>, &s;ome Time &s;ince, but were by no means the Pro|perty of the Managers, or any one belonging to the Theatre, nor were to be got that Night; &s;o that all the Heroes were equally di&s;|appointed
<PB N="11" REF="12">
of tho&s;e Trappings. Your Impa|tience increa&s;ed, and, tho' another Robe was brought you, (the &s;ame Robe that was made new, this Year, for Mr. <HI>Husband</HI>, in the Character of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>) you per&s;i&s;ted in having the other uncomeatable Robe, or you po&s;itively would undre&s;s, and was deter|mined not to play. To every body's Surprize you did undre&s;s, and, in &s;pight of the mo&s;t friendly Remon&s;trances to the contrary, you made a broken kind of Speech to the Audi|ence; with which they were &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied, they could not help &s;hewing it.</P>
<P>Before you went on, I entreated you (on the meer Exchange of a Robe) not do &s;o un|politic a Thing, I might add, unpolite, as to think of di&s;appointing the Town of their Diver&s;ion: You reply'd, The Vexation had deprived you of your Voice, and rendered you incapable of performing: I de&s;ired you to con&s;ider, the fir&s;t Act was of &s;uch a con|&s;iderable Length, you might have Time enough to recover your Temper, and your Voice would probably return with it; or if the Defect la&s;ted, your attempting to per|form would appear &s;o obliging, the Audience would readily make any Allowances, when they knew you had been ruffled, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but to think of giving them no Play at all, was what I could not but conceive would offend them.</P>
<P>To repeat all was &s;aid to you on this Oc|ca&s;ion, would add to the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of this
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Recital: But, as near as I can remember, no|thing was omitted, in the mo&s;t friendly man|ner, to di&s;&s;uade you from your mi&s;taken Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I am informed you &s;taid afterwards, ju&s;t long enough to hear the extraordinary indul|gent Reception the Audience were plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on my propo&s;ing, with their Leave, to give them the Play, <HI>in the be&s;t Manner we could, &s;ince it was not in our Power to give it them &s;o well as we would</HI>. You then ran ha&s;tily out of the Hou&s;e, and &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age afterwards to the Theatre, That you would not, by any means, have your Name delivered out for another Play, for you would po&s;i|tively act no more.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not, Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, have given you or my&s;elf this Trouble, but for the many Reports that fly about, of which, 'tis &s;aid, you are the Author: And &s;ince I have ad|vanced &s;o far, I mu&s;t go a little farther, and make a few hone&s;t <HI>Queries</HI>; then, giving you a little Advice, &s;hall &s;ubmit to the Determi|nation of the Publick, whether I (as it has been in&s;inuated) ever intended you the lea&s;t Prejudice; or, on the contrary, have not al|ways acted towards you with Good-manners and Good-nature?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then,&mdash;have I not your Letter by me, &s;ent to me when in <HI>England</HI>, wherein you expre&s;s your&s;elf very de&s;irous of my act|ing in the &s;ame Theatre with you, and are &s;olicitous for my coming over?&mdash;And
<PB N="13" REF="14">
do you not know, your particular Applica|tion &s;ince my Arrival, was one of my &s;trong|e&s;t Motives for playing in <HI>Smock-Alley</HI>, where I am likely to have a Law-Suit, for my Right, with the Managers, tho' I was offer'd the &s;ame Terms from <HI>Aungier Street</HI> Play-hou&s;e, where my Agreement would have been &s;ign'd by a Gentleman of Honour, who&s;e Pay is as good as the Bank?</P>
<P>Have I not, on your return to the Stage this Sea&s;on, in Compliment to you, play'd &s;ome inferior Characters, which, 'tis well known, I had a long time re&s;ign'd to younger Actors in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>Did I omit any Care, or grudge any Pains, to keep the Audience in Temper, when your &s;udden Indi&s;po&s;ition prevented your playing the fir&s;t intended Night of King <HI>Lear?</HI> Or, could I, for a Brother, have been more active, to &s;ilence the Reports then made to your Pre|judice?&mdash;<HI>&s;ed Tu Brute!</HI></P>
<P>Have not I de&s;ir'd you, tho' our remaining Nights of Playing were few, and we had large Sums at Stake, to fix the Plays to your own Mind?</P>
<P>Have you not been paid a large Part of that fre&s;h Agreement you made, but did not com|pleat, while we are unpaid our Agreements, tho', we have, 'tis notorious, often &s;olicited the Managers to relea&s;e us, if they found the Emptine&s;s of the Town would not an&s;wer their continuing our Performance?&mdash;But we could get neither our Liberty nor our Money.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">Have not you often been an Ear-witne&s;s of the&s;e Propo&s;als, and as often declar'd, we be|hav'd with the greate&s;t Lenity, and &s;tricte&s;t Honour?</P>
<P>Did not your &s;udden breaking off from Playing leave us in a di&s;plea&s;ing Dilemma? And was it not rea&s;onable for us, to propo&s;e acting &s;uch Pieces, as might excite the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity in the Town, whereby the Mana|gers might be enabled to pay us, and the re&s;t of the Company?</P>
<P>Did I not decline ('till your po&s;itive De|claration, that you would play no more this Sea&s;on) appearing in any Character you had perform'd? And did you not expre&s;s your&s;elf as oblig'd to me, on making you that Com|pliment, as you were pleas'd to term it?</P>
<P>How comes it then, Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, reported, that Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI>, and my &s;elf, have intended you any Injury? Or from whence is it &s;aid, that we (ridiculous, as fal&s;e!) lock'd up your Cloaths, and did all we could to prevent your Playing? This, Sir, has been &s;o frequently a&s;&s;erted, as a Fact related by you, that you ought as a Friend to Truth, to have fully an&s;wered &s;uch mon&s;trous Fal&s;hoods; or may we not rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, you did &s;pread &s;uch Reports? If you can be the Author of &s;uch naughty Tales, what Language is fit to paint you?</P>
<P>The Letters I read this Day in the <HI>Dublin Journal</HI>, if not <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> yours, are yet &s;o worded, an impartial Reader cannot but &s;ee
<PB N="15" REF="16">
they were, at lea&s;t, the work of &s;ome mi&s;ta|ken Friend, who&s;e Good-nature you had im|po&s;ed on, by fal&s;e Relations: From whom, but you, could come the <HI>&s;atisfactory Rea&s;ons, (not one of which are mentioned</HI>) for your not performing? Or the poor low Invectives, and mean Inuendoes therein contained?&mdash;Whom do you mean, by <HI>De&s;igning Wretches</HI>, and <HI>Theatrical Politicians?</HI> Or what can you in|tend but to in&s;inuate, you have been artfully drove from the Stage, when you know your Ab&s;ence from thence is ab&s;olutely your own Act and Deed?</P>
<P>Fie! fie! &s;tick to Truth, or be a&s;hamed of &s;uch publick Addre&s;&s;es, or to &s;how your Face after them.</P>
<P>May not one &s;uppo&s;e, Ma&s;ter <HI>Sheridan</HI>, the kind and civil Intention of the&s;e two Letters, is to create a Di&s;turbance in the future Audi|ences?</P>
<P>But let me inform you, when a Rebuff to an Actor appears premeditated and be&s;poke from Prejudice, &s;uch Treatment may put a poor Player out of Humour; but &s;ure it ought not to put him out of Countenance.</P>
<P>If you withdraw your&s;elf from the Theatre for a Time, mu&s;t all Diver&s;ion &s;top 'till your Return? If a Vintner has not <HI>Ortelans</HI>, or any other extraordinary Dainties, in the Larder, will his Gue&s;ts think it impertinent, if they are intreated to take &s;uch homely Entertain|ment as the Hou&s;e affords?&mdash;And if the Defects of others, &s;erve as a Foil to the Bril|liancy

<P>But Ma&s;ter <HI>Tommy</HI>, may we not &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect, tho' your Performances have been hi|therto mo&s;tly tragical, you have given your Mind a little Bent towards Comedy, and, in tho&s;e Studies, have taken a Hint from <HI>Congreve</HI>'s <HI>Petulant?</HI> who, to keep up an extraordinary Reputation, was notorious, under a Di&s;gui&s;e, for calling for him&s;elf at a Coffee-hou&s;e; where he would &s;ometimes, in a Ma&s;k, &s;end in for him&s;elf, wait for him&s;elf, nay, and not finding him&s;elf, would frequently <HI>leave a Let|ter for him&s;elf:</HI>&mdash; 'Faith you are highly in Luck in improving a Hint I find.</P>

<P>AS there were many Witne&s;&s;es of the tu|multuous Riot, which you occa&s;ioned la&s;t Night at the Theatre (for which the Town are highly obliged to you) I &s;hall make no Reflections on it; but leave the Relation thereof to the Impartial, and Unprejudic'd: &mdash;I &s;ay you occa&s;ioned; for, the Pretence of the College being offended, is a meer Pre|tence: They are Men of Rea&s;on, and will not re&s;ent without a Cau&s;e: Nor is it a Reflection on the Society, that a few may be mi&s;led, by their mi&s;taken Partiality to you; that ought no more to bring an Odium on &s;uch a large and worthy Body, than that you were, once, an unworthy Member thereof, which the Majority, by this Time, probably wi&s;h you ne'er had been.</P>
<P>Your Behaviour, Friend <HI>Thomas</HI>, has been &s;o bad, I doubt if the &s;malle&s;t or lowe&s;t Body of People would chu&s;e you to mingle with them; I &s;carce believe, the mo&s;t indifferent Troop of Stroling Players, would chu&s;e to rank with you. Yet 'tis methinks a Pity! You &s;hould not be quite lo&s;t to the Stage; &s;ince, tho' you are not equal to all Parts, there are two. I'll venture to &s;ay, you'll always make an extraordinary Figure in; I mean the

<P>Would any friendly Monitor convince me, how 'tis po&s;&s;ible for me, to have &s;aid, or done ought to the Offence of any one in this King|dom (you Ma&s;ter <HI>Tommy</HI> excepted) I &s;hould be a&s;ham'd not to acknowledge my Error, and would readily as I ought, a&s;k their Pardon. &mdash; But why &s;hould I wonder at your un|ho&s;pitable Attempts towards a Stranger, when you could &s;o unmercifully threaten even a Brother, with being ill u&s;ed, if he pre&s;umed to play any Part of yours; this is a Fact, naughty-paughty <HI>Tommy</HI>, too well known by many for you to deny.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. SHERIDAN's Second ADDRESS To the TOWN.</HEAD>
<P>I Was in Hopes I &s;hould not have had Oc|ca&s;ion to trouble the Publick any more, but farther Misfortunes falling on me, and farther Crimes laid to my Charge, have put me under the Nece&s;&s;ity of vindicating my&s;elf.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that I &s;pirited up the Scholars to prevent Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s performing la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day</HI>.&mdash;In an&s;wer to this, I mo&s;t &s;olemnly declare, that upon reading the Ad|verti&s;ement which they had put in <HI>Faulkner</HI>'s Journal, without my Knowledge, out of Zeal to my Intere&s;t, I made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to find out the Gentlemen who had drawn it up, and by all the Arguments I was Ma&s;ter of, drew a Promi&s;e from them that they would not go to the Play-Hou&s;e the above Night. For the Truth of this, I appeal to them&s;elves. They have already publi&s;h'd an Adverti&s;ement in <HI>Reilly</HI>'s Paper of la&s;t <HI>Satur|day</HI>, in which they have entirely clear'd me, and given Rea&s;ons why they alter'd their Re|&s;olution. Mo&s;t of the&s;e Gentlemen I was
<PB N="25" REF="26">
hardly known to; if I had had a De&s;ign to have form'd a Party in the College, I think it was mo&s;t probable, that I &s;hould have ap|plied to &s;uch as I had the plea&s;ure of know|ing: I appeal to them then, or any of them, whether I ever &s;poke to them on that Head, unle&s;s it was to u&s;e their Endeavours to pre|vent any &s;uch Re&s;olution being enter'd into.</P>
<P>Tho' the Publick may have but little Re|gard to my bare Word on this Occa&s;ion, yet if they con&s;ider, that after &s;o &s;olemn a De|claration, if what I &s;ay be fal&s;e, I put it in the Power of any one of the&s;e Gentlemen, at any Time, to prove me a Scoundrel, if they con&s;ider how low I mu&s;t fall, even in their Opinions, &s;hould I give what they know to be a Lye, under my Hand in a public Man|ner, I hope no one will think, that I would, with my Eyes open, commit &s;uch a Piece of Folly.</P>
<P>I well knew the fatal Con&s;equences of forming a Party, and too well fore&s;aw the U&s;e my Enemies would make of it, to my Di&s;advantage. For, indeed, what could I propo&s;e to my&s;elf by it, but to bring the Hatred of the Public upon me, and what End would it an&s;wer? I never look'd on Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> as an Antagoni&s;t of mine; I always had &s;o mean an Opinion of him in his Cha|racters in Tragedy, that I would not even wi&s;h that he &s;hould have the Reputation of being &s;uch, by any Oppo&s;ition made on my Part; I hope the Publick will readily believe,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
that I had no Cau&s;e to be afraid of his appearing in any Character of mine.</P>
<P>As to the impudent and &s;currilous Epi&s;tle which Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> publi&s;h'd, I was determin'd to take no Notice of it, for I thought him in every Re&s;pect beneath my lowe&s;t Re&s;entment; I did not care to wre&s;tle with a Sweep-chim|ney: But as I find there are a few who do not know the Man, led away by his fal&s;e Repre&s;entations, and as he has endeavoured to abu&s;e that noble Principle, for which this Kingdom is &s;o ju&s;tly famed, and which I hope we &s;hall never lo&s;e, I mean that generous Spirit of Ho&s;pitality derived to us from our Forefathers, to his own wicked Ends and Purpo&s;es, I think it nece&s;&s;ary for my own Sake, and for the Sake of the Publick, to unma&s;k this <HI>Iago</HI>, and lay him open to the World. In order to do this, I &s;hall beg leave to &s;tate one Fact.</P>
<P>The Night that I was to have performed <HI>Cato</HI>, (an unfortunate Night for me, when a thou&s;and unfore&s;een Accidents had thrown me into &s;uch a di&s;order'd State of Mind as I had never known before) I found of a &s;ud|den Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Behaviour, which before was very complai&s;ant, or rather meanly &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive, was totally changed; in&s;tead of try|ing all Methods to appea&s;e a Per&s;on be&s;ide him&s;elf with Pa&s;&s;ion, he did all he could to aggravate Matters: When I asked him what I &s;hould do in this Exigence, for want of a Robe? he an&s;wered, &s;omewhat &s;hortly, play without
<PB N="27" REF="28">
a Robe: When, upon that, I laid open to him what a de&s;picable Figure I &s;hould make, he turn'd upon his Heel, and &s;aid, D&mdash;n me if I care what you do, the Play &s;hall not &s;tand &s;till for you; and immediately went and ordered the Prompter to draw up the Curtain. When I heard this, I was &s;tunn'd at the In&s;olence of the Fellow, who neither had any Right to command in that Hou&s;e; nor was in any Shape intere&s;ted in the Event of that Night. It put me pa&s;t all Patience, and the Terror I was under, le&s;t the Curtain &s;hould be drawn up before I had Time to make an Apology, at a Time that I found my&s;elf incapable of playing, made me ru&s;h like a Madman precipitately on the Stage, before I had con&s;idered what I &s;hould &s;ay to the Audience. Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, to my great Surprize, came on immediately after me, and very officiou&s;ly (to give it no har&s;her a Term) offered to read the Part of <HI>Cato</HI>, at the &s;ame Time that he was to play <HI>Syphax</HI>. I &s;ay officiou&s;ly; for if I can make it appear that he was no way concerned, either in Point of Intere&s;t or Money, the World will judge &s;o too.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> knows, that the Actors had determined to &s;eize on the Receipts of that Night, and all the &s;ucceeding ones, except the next, (the entire Receipts of which were to be mine) to pay them&s;elves their Salaries, of which they had been defrauded by the Roguery of &s;ome of the Managers. He
<PB N="28" REF="29">
knows, that the Rea&s;on of his continuing to play on afterwards, was only to fulfil his Agreement, that he might have an Opportu|nity of &s;uing the Per&s;ons he contracted with for the Sum &s;tipulated. He knows (notwith|&s;tanding his plau&s;ible Pretence in his Epi&s;tle, for chu&s;ing the Characters which he gave out) that he intended to perform, in the&s;e Words,
<Q>&startq;And was it not rea&s;onable for us propo&s;e acting &s;uch Pieces, as might ex|cite the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity in the Town, <HI>whereby the Managers might be enabled to &endq;pay us and the re&s;t of the Company</HI>.</Q>
I &s;ay, he knows that not a Shilling of this was ei|ther to go to the Managers, or to them. He knows, that he had a Lawyer's Opinion, That it was not nece&s;&s;ary for him to perform the Number of Nights mentioned in their Agreement, it was &s;ufficient if he was ready to perform them in the limited Time. He knows, that he reckoned into one of the Number the Play of the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI>, which was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Night before. What then could prompt Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, to make &s;uch an extravagant and impudent Propo&s;al to the Audience, as that of reading the Character of <HI>Cato</HI>, when at the &s;ame Time he was to play <HI>Syphax</HI>. I &s;ay, what could prompt him to give him&s;elf &s;o much unnece&s;&s;ary Trouble, if he was no way obliged to it, either in Point of Duty, Intere&s;t, or Money. It was a malicious and wicked Scheme which he had long had in Agitation, and which my Misfortune that
<PB N="29" REF="30">
Night fir&s;t gave him an Opportunity of put|ting in Practice. It was a De&s;ign of building his Fame upon my Ruin.</P>
<P>In order to prove this, I &s;hall, fir&s;t of all, give a &s;hort Account of my Behaviour to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, &s;ince his Arrival in this King|dom. To proceed in his own Method, I &s;hall beg leave to ask him a few Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Is he not con&s;cious, that had it not been for me, he could not have &s;et his Foot on any Stage in this Kingdom?</P>
<P>Did I not qua&s;h a Cartel, which was &s;ign|ed by the Managers of both Companies, un|der &s;evere Penalties, to exclude him from acting on either Stage?</P>
<P>Did I not, as a Stranger, treat him with all Civility, tho' the unhappy Character he labour'd under prevented my having any Friend&s;hip with him?</P>
<P>Was I not a principal Means of preventing the Trial between Mr. <HI>Sloper</HI> and him, and the Letters which pa&s;&s;ed between him and his Wife, from being reprinted here &s;oon after his Arrival: And did I not commi&s;&s;ion a Friend to offer the Expence of the Im|pre&s;&s;ion, out of my own Pocket, rather than a Stranger &s;hould be hurt?</P>
<P>Did I not promi&s;e him, to &s;tudy any new Character for his &s;econd Benefit? (A Favour which I had refu&s;ed to others much more worthy of it.)</P>
<P>Did I not, when I found Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> tri|fling with him, and refu&s;ing to perform the
<PB N="30" REF="31">
Contract, before his Face declare, that I never would in any Shape be concern'd with Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> hereafter, if be did not pay him, nay, more, offer'd to play with Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> in the other Hou&s;e; to try by that Means to make up his Lo&s;s?</P>
<P>Did not Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;ay on that Occa&s;ion, that I behav'd with &s;uch Honour, and laid him under &s;uch Obligations, that he only wi&s;h'd for an Opportunity to return them?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t be had was the above-mention'd unhappy Night. Might not one rea&s;onably expect after all this, that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> would not try to injure me, if I did nothing to in|jure him? But he had worn the Ma&s;k too long, he found an Opportunity of throwing it off, and leap'd at it with the greate&s;t Ea|gerne&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the many Obliga|tions I had laid him under to me; he could not forgive me, that my Name brought full Hou&s;es, when he was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s, or to play to empty Benches. His Envy, Spleen, and Malice, which long lay &s;mother'd in his Brea&s;t, now bur&s;t forth into a Blaze. He &s;aw me under the Nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;appointing an Audience, and con&s;equently di&s;obliging them. He contributed as far as in him lay to the one, and was determin'd to improve the other.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn, that he was not ob|liged, by any Principle of Duty or Profit, to this Work of Supererogation; it mu&s;t be then from &s;ome other Motive, <HI>Complai&s;ance
<PB N="31" REF="32">
to the Audience perhaps</HI>.&mdash;Impudent as he is, he cannot think that the doing &s;o un|precedented a Thing, as that of reading a capital Part, and playing another at the &s;ame Time, could give them any Plea&s;ure; an Attempt which no one but him&s;elf could ever have thought of, and which even his own Hardine&s;s mu&s;t have been &s;hocked at, had he not had the blacke&s;t Malice in his Heart to prompt him to it. He &s;aw the Audience greatly offended at the Di&s;appoint|ment they met with in my not being able to perform, and very ju&s;tly too, &s;ince it was not in my power to give them the Rea&s;ons which prevented it. He laid hold of this Opportunity, at once, to run me down in the Opinion of the World, and ingratiate him&s;elf by the Appearance of an officious Zeal <HI>to do every Thing that might give Plea|&s;ure to the Public</HI>. He hoped by this Means to drive me out of the Kingdom, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h him&s;elf here for the next Winter, as he knows it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to return to <HI>London</HI>. This is the more probable, as I had often declar'd in Confidence to him, that I &s;hould never be able to &s;tand the Shock of any Party form'd again&s;t me. His &s;ub&s;e|quent Behaviour is a manife&s;t Proof of his De&s;ign: For after I had left the Playhou&s;e, and &s;ent Word in the Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion, that I &s;hould never play there again, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, for Fear I &s;hould cool upon it, or try to re|concile the Favour of the Town to me
<PB N="32" REF="33">
again, in a violent Hurry gave out three Plays together, (a mo&s;t unu&s;ual Thing, unle&s;s in ca&s;e of Benefits) in two of which he was to appear in Characters of mine. By this Means, let me have been ever &s;o innocent, had not the other Company been in Town, I mu&s;t have quitted the Field to him, and left him triumphant.</P>
<P>This was not all&mdash;</P>
<P>When I endeavour'd to vindicate my&s;elf to the Public, and make an Apology for not performing, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> undertook to an&s;wer me. What Right, or what Colour like to Right, had he to undertake it? I made no mention of him in the Paper which I pub|li&s;h'd, tho' I had a ju&s;t Rea&s;on to do it; be|cau&s;e I did not care to be embroil'd with a Man of his trouble&s;ome Temper, who has always kept every Theatre in which he was engag'd in hot Water. I had hitherto had no Quarrel to him, I had done him &s;ome Favours, &s;hould he not if he had the lea&s;t Humanity (to leave Gratitude out of the Que&s;tion) have endeavour'd rather to clear me in the Opinion of the Town than endea|vour'd to hurt me. I cannot find that he him&s;elf has given any tolerable Colour for his entering &s;o cavalierly a Volunteer in the Cau&s;e. His &s;etting out, where certainly he ought to have given &s;ome Rea&s;on for his undertaking &s;uch a Part, is no more than this;
<Q>&startq;Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, Your injudicious Di&s;|appointment of the Company la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day</HI>,
<PB N="33" REF="34">
who expected to &s;ee you in the Character of <HI>Cato</HI>, and your indi&s;creet Attempt to di&s;mi&s;s the Audience, having, as you con|fe&s;s, become a Town-talk, and given Ri&s;e to many idle Fal&s;hoods, merely calculated to injure the Innocent, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I relate the Fact, &s;trictly adhering to &endq;Truth.</Q>
So that here he does not pretend to give any Rea&s;on, only, <HI>You mu&s;t excu&s;e</HI>.</P>
<P>Here and thro' the whole Epi&s;tle, you may ob&s;erve by his ill-natur'd and bitter Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, his per&s;onal Pique and Spleen to me, who never had injur'd him. Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> mentions in the Cour&s;e of his Letter, that he heard I had &s;pread about &s;everal Reports to his Di&s;advantage, but why did Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, who&s;e Motto to this Epi&s;tle is, <HI>It is a kind of Slander to tru&s;t to Rumour</HI>, &s;o readily believe tho&s;e Reports of one with whom he had hitherto liv'd on a good Footing. Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> had heard the &s;ame Thing in regard to him|&s;elf, but he, like a Gentleman, came and ask'd me the Truth of it, and I &s;atisfy'd him. Why did not Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, if he had the lea&s;t of a Gentleman about him, behave in the &s;ame Manner, before be ventur'd to pub|li&s;h them to the World, and draw Conclu|&s;ions from them, as Truths, to my Di&s;advan|tage? No, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> neither wanted, nor wi&s;h'd that I &s;hould ju&s;tify my&s;elf; his Affairs were grown &s;o de&s;perate, that he had no Hope left, but by a Train of villanous Ca|lumnies, and a Profu&s;ion of &s;currilous Lan|guage,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
to try to make me do &s;omething mon|&s;trous, to plunge me &s;till deeper in the Di&s;|plea&s;ure of the Town; at lea&s;t he had Hopes that this Conduct might rou&s;e (perhaps) the indi&s;creet Zeal of &s;ome of my Friends or Well-wi&s;hers, to attempt &s;omething again&s;t him, which he would be &s;ure to lay at my Door. Unhappily for me, the latter Part &s;ucceeded to his Wi&s;h.</P>
<P>To prove that this was his Principle, I &s;hall only make u&s;e of one Argument. I &s;hall not pretend to ju&s;tify or condemn the Gentlemen of the College, it is not my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and the World may ea&s;ily &s;ee how tick|li&s;h a Point that would be for me to handle. All I &s;hall endeavour to do, is, to prove that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, knowingly and willingly, brought it upon him&s;elf. He treated the Adverti&s;e|ments which they had put into the <HI>Journal</HI>, in a contemptuous and in&s;olent Way, on a Suppo&s;ition that they were mine. But no one &s;hall make me believe that any Man of common Sen&s;e, as I will allow Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> to be, could &s;uppo&s;e me either fooli&s;h enough or ba&s;e enough to do it. Had I wrote &s;uch an Adverti&s;ement in the Name of the Gentle|men of the College, was it not natural for them to enquire who it was that dar'd to make u&s;e of their Name, and had I done it, what Puni&s;hment would have been too great for my Pre&s;umption?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> might ea&s;ily have known of Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI>, whether they had left it there
<PB N="35" REF="36">
or no. Upon this Probability then, that he mu&s;t have known it was theirs, what could Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> expect from a Set of young Gen|tlemen, who are, thro' their Youth, warm? What could he hope for, but that they would &s;hew their Re&s;entment for this contemptuous Manner of treating what they had wrote? Nay, mu&s;t he not expect, that probably they would think them&s;elves bound in Honour to take &s;ome publick Method of convincing him that they had wrote it, le&s;t the Calumny which he had ca&s;t upon me, thro' their Si|lence, &s;hould be fix'd upon me. People may wonder, that Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;hould run &s;uch a Ri&s;que from &s;uch a Motive; but he has been &s;o accu&s;tom'd to Things of this Nature, that they appear to him but as common Matters. The Plea&s;ure he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf in having an Opportunity of di&s;playing his Eloquence the next Day, of throwing at the Feet of the Public <HI>an unfortunate Stranger unho&s;pitably us'd</HI>, and above all, the joyful Hope of being able to fix this Di&s;turbance upon me, as it's Author, would, he thought, more than com|pen&s;ate for any Thing he could &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> is the more inexcu&s;able, as I took all Pains to prevent his doing any ra&s;h Thing, which might draw more Odium on him from the Gentlemen of the College; I told Mr. <HI>Wright</HI> and &s;everal others of the Players, that it might reach his Ears, that I had been with the Gentlemen of the College, to prevent any Mi&s;chief, not for Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s
<PB N="36" REF="37">
&s;ake, (for I owed him no Favour) but my own: That I had laid open to them the ill Con&s;equences that would attend me, &s;hould any Di&s;turbance happen at the Theatre; that upon this, they had all promi&s;ed in a &s;olemn Manner, not to go; and I bid them a&s;&s;ure Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, that he need not fear any Inter|ruption. Notwith&s;tanding this, he publi&s;h'd his Epi&s;tle afterwards, wherein the Gentle|men of the College thought them&s;elves per|&s;onally ill-treated, and were rouz'd into &s;uch a Rage, as no Endeavours of mine or all Mankind could have appeas'd.</P>
<P>Does not this Conduct of his evidently prove, that he &s;hut his Eyes to Conviction, that he was determin'd at all Events to pur&s;ue the Scheme he had laid down; it either mu&s;t be owing to this, or to the &s;trange&s;t Infatuation that ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Man. As to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Po&s;t&s;cript, I read it without any Emotion, and heartily thank him for it. He has there painted him&s;elf in &s;tronger Colours than either I could, or my Humanity would &s;uffer me me to do. His ridiculous Challenge, in the true Stile of an <HI>Ancient Pi&s;tol</HI>, &s;ent to me by all the News-Boys in Town, I de&s;pi&s;e. He has put him&s;elf, by his Behaviour, far be|neath the Footing of a Gentleman. I &s;hall go about my Bu&s;ine&s;s as u&s;ual, if I am attack'd, I &s;hall endeavour to defend my&s;elf, nor &s;hall I ever be afraid of any who dare do Wrong. And now I have done with him &mdash; I am &s;orry I have been compelled to &s;hew
<PB N="37" REF="38">
any Man in &s;o bad a Light, but the World mu&s;t do me the Ju&s;tice to own, he has forc'd me to do it in my own Defence, I &s;hall trouble my Head no farther with him, but leave him to Heav'n,
<Q><L>And to the Thorns which in his Bo&s;om lodge,</L>
<L>To goad and &s;ting him.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is now Time I &s;hould addre&s;s my&s;elf to the Publick. There are two Things laid to my Charge; one is, that I &s;pirited up the Gentlemen of the College to rai&s;e a Di&s;tur|bance in the Theatre.&mdash;A heavy Charge indeed, if true: I have done all that is in the Power of Man to clear my&s;elf of it, and I hope there is none of the lea&s;t Humanity but will acquit me. The other is, That I wil|lingly di&s;obliged the Publick in not playing the Part of <HI>Cato</HI>.</P>
<P>I publi&s;hed an Apology, not without con|&s;ulting a Gentleman, of great Knowledge and Experience in the World, in it, which, perhaps, the Over-Ea&s;ine&s;s of my Friends thought a &s;ufficient Defence. Perhaps, in|deed, I impo&s;ed on my&s;elf as well as them.</P>
<P>If there be any who think I meant them an Offence, that I did it thro' Wantonne&s;s, or thro' Contempt of the Audience, I heartily a&s;k their Pardon; and the only Way I have left to make them Amends, is to exert my|&s;elf in that Character on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> next, if they will honour me with their Company that Night. The Matter is come to this I&s;&s;ue, that I mu&s;t either ri&s;e or fall in the
<PB N="38" REF="39">
Opinion of the World by the Event of that Night. If I am the Per&s;on Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> re|pre&s;ents; if I was an unworthy Member of the College; (which my old Cotemporaries there, and tho&s;e Ornaments of Learning, the Fellows, who knew my Behaviour, will hardly take his Word for) if I am not fit to be received in a Company of Strollers, (for which Compliment the many People of Fa|&s;hion, who have honour'd me with their Acquaintance in private, and their Approba|tion in publick, are much obliged to him) I am not indeed worthy of your Countenance: You all know me; I have lived among&s;t you; if have the lea&s;t Title to your Favour, I hope the Good-nature of my Friends, and the Benevolence of the Publick, which I have &s;o often, and in &s;o extraordinary a Man|ner experienced, will not de&s;ert me in this Exigence, nor &s;uffer me to fall a Sacrifice to the mean Artifice, and be bani&s;hed my Coun|try by the wicked Schemes of a&mdash;no, I will not put my&s;elf &s;o much on a Footing with him, as to call him by the Name he de&s;erves&mdash;who, I am well a&s;&s;ur'd, dare not &s;hew his Face in his own.</P>
<P>If any Expre&s;&s;ions too warm or indi&s;creet, have drop'd from me, in the Cour&s;e of this Addre&s;s, I hope for the Indulgence of the Publick, when I inform them that I have been obliged to draw it up almo&s;t in the Space of one Day, and that too in no very ea&s;y State of Mind: For I que&s;tion whether

many other Things he has mode&s;tly ventur'd to a&s;&s;ert, even when Numbers know the con|trary.

Add to this his previous Decla|rations to any one's appearing in any Part he had thought of playing; his threatning them with an ill Reception from his Friends, over whom he boa&s;ted a particular Sway (no great Compliment to them by the way) and what mu&s;t we think of this Man; or what Regard ought the Publick to have either to his Word or Oath?</P>
<P>The Riot that en&s;ued on the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> fol|lowing, is known to the whole Town; their Sentiments of it will better come from their Mouths than my Pen.&mdash;The Town's ge|nerous and uncommon Reception and Pro|tection
<PB N="$$" REF="43" MS="Y">
of me &s;ince, was an In&s;tance what an Abhorrence they had of the former ra&s;h Be|haviour of a few, mi&s;led by a very bad Man: &mdash;I mu&s;t have Recour&s;e to his Vocabulary, e'er I can find Words low enough to paint him. The kind Treatment the Publick af|forded me on <HI>Monday</HI> Night, I am con&s;cious, was more owing to their &s;pirited ho&s;pitable U&s;age of a Stranger, than any Merits my Attempts to plea&s;e them could lay claim to: &mdash;I have a &s;incere and grateful Sen&s;e of their Favours; it warms my Heart, and I &s;hall al|ways think it a Duty incumbent on me, loud|ly to acknowledge an Act &s;o much to their Honour: I confe&s;s it here, and &s;hall not forget it when in <HI>England</HI>, to which Place I am re|turning &s;peedily;&mdash;tho' the mode&s;t, the brave Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI>, who&s;e Veracity is to be ranked with bis other Virtues, is plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert the Impo&s;&s;ibility of my returning.

<P>Let me inform him, all bad Expre&s;&s;ions re|tort upon the Slanderer; let then his own &s;cur|rilous Libel &s;tick on him&s;elf, till he wipes it off like a Gentleman. His Affectation of treating me with Contempt, as an Actor, is &s;uch a pretty Piece of pre&s;umptive Vanity, that his choice Opinion alone &s;hould lead the Town, and &s;uch a paltry Puff of his own Prai&s;e, as is only fit to be laugh'd at.

In the fir&s;t Place, if we act in diffe|rent Hou&s;es, the Town will po&s;&s;ibly be divided, and the Receipts of both will nece&s;&s;arily be much le&s;&s;ened. Not that I &s;hould expect this upon the footing of Merit, but I know not how it is,
<PB N="$$" REF="45" MS="Y">
whether it be their Partiality to their Country-man, or whether it be owing to the powerful In|tere&s;t of a Number of Friends that I have in this City, but there never was known &s;uch En|couragement, &s;uch Applau&s;e given to any Actor, or &s;uch full Hou&s;es as &s;ince I appear'd on the Stage. Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> will inform you that <HI>Dub|lin</HI> is not like <HI>London,</HI> we have not two Audi|ences in the whole City, e&s;pecially <HI>as the Town is now more empty than it has ever been known</HI>.

<P>But, to go on with you, Sir, pray what were tho&s;e thou&s;and unfore&s;een Accidents that &s;o di&s;order'd your dear Mind, on the fatal Night you mention? Why have you not recited them? I call'd on you to do it in my Epi&s;tle to you.

This A&s;|&s;ertion every one, behind the Scenes that Night, can deny; I appeal to Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wright</HI>, and many others there, if I did not advi&s;e you, like a Friend and a Gentle|man, not to do an indi&s;creet uncivil Thing toward the Audience, let <HI>Philips</HI> or any one be to blame;&mdash;and &s;o,

The&s;e Lyes are as mon&s;trous as the Father of 'em. I never order'd the Curtain to ri&s;e till the Au|dience accepted my Offer of having <HI>Cato</HI> read.

'Tis true, <HI>You</HI>, Mr, <HI>Morris</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Wright</HI> agreed, they &s;hould have that Hou&s;e, not hav|ing received any Salary for three Weeks &mdash; But, you propos'd to receive the next for your&s;elf alone: And had taken care to &s;eize the be&s;t Receipt taken at your playing, (viz. the fir&s;t Night of <HI>Cato</HI>) which did not amount to Forty Pounds.&mdash;Who then acted ho|ne&s;tly, I, who cho&s;e not to di&s;mi&s;s the Au|dience, or you, who to the Di&s;appointment of the poor unpaid People, would have de|priv'd 'em of the Receipt of that Hou&s;e, by a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion?

That a Gen|tleman of Honour, in this City, did prevent the Re-publi&s;hing of the abovemention'd Letters, I have rea&s;on to believe, and mu&s;t think it de&s;ign'd as an Act of Good-nature in him, as not willing either &s;hould be hurt:&mdash; But your &s;topping 'em I know nothing of, any more than I do of the Obligations, you would intimate, I have to you, unle&s;s you mean it an Obligation,&mdash;that I have acci|dently

<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 5. Did I not promi&s;e him, to &s;tudy any new Character, for his &s;econd Benefit? A Favour which I had refu&s;ed to others, much more worthy of it.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> You did promi&s;e to &s;tudy a Part for my Benefit, tho' I did not want you to do it; but you &s;ince &s;aid you'd play no more; and if you have refu&s;ed that mountainous Favour, as your own vain Imagination paints it, to wor|thier Per&s;ons, I think, as every one will, you were very much to blame.</P>

<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 7. Did not Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;ay on that Occa&s;ion, that I behav'd with &s;uch Honour, and laid him under &s;uch Obligations, that he only wi&s;h'd for an Opportunity to return them?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 6. <HI>and</HI> 7. When <HI>Philips</HI> trifled, and behaved ill enough (as he knows not how to behave well) you did talk of being concern'd no more with <HI>Philips</HI>, and of playing with me in another Hou&s;e (which you thought it would be your Intere&s;t to do) I made you &s;everal
<PB N="$$" REF="57" MS="Y">
Compliments on that Account, which, on Reflection, were more than you de&s;erv'd, for a Propo&s;ition you had no Right to make; &s;ince you were then actually engaged with <HI>Philips</HI>, in Articles for &s;ome time, &s;o could not keep your Word. And whenever you play, the Players too well know how much your own Intere&s;t will be con&s;idered, before the Welfare of any one Per&s;on, or the Intere&s;t of the whole Body.</P>
<P>May one not rea&s;onably &s;ugge&s;t, you rather cho&s;e to play with me, that my Good-na|ture, or Good-manners (call it Indolence if you will) might decline any Part you wi&s;h'd? And if the all-&s;ufficient <HI>Tommy</HI> held my playing in Tragedy &s;o cheap, whence all the&s;e unea&s;y Cautions of his, again&s;t my playing in that Light? Or his Endeavours, before I appeared in the Kingdom, to imprint in the Minds of &s;ome People (the&s;e Things can be prov'd, <HI>Tom|my</HI>) my Incapacity for &s;uch Performance? Or whence his pre&s;ent Anger avow'd again&s;t any Attempts of mine of that &s;ort? Indeed, Child, your Heart betrays you here; it outruns your Cunning.
