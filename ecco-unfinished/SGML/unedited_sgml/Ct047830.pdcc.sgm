<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>II KINGS, Chap. IV. Ver. 13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Thou ha&s;t been careful for us, with all this Care, what is to be done for thee?&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE more we con&s;ider the great Duty of doing Good to others the &s;tronger we find our Obligations to perform it; to which we have this quickening Motive, that whil&s;t we are acting for their Benefit we are certainly promoting our own Happine&s;s: For we cannot give a more &s;en&s;ible Delight to our own unprejudiced Minds than by advancing the Welfare of Mankind, which is no other than employing &s;ome of the be&s;t and mo&s;t di|&s;tingui&s;hed Qualities of our Nature on proper and becoming Objects. A Neglect therefore of this Duty mu&s;t always be attended with Mi&s;ery, as it is a Re&s;traint upon the Faculties, and a Departure from the Glory, of our Nature.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>AGAIN, We promote our own Happine&s;s by doing Good to others not only in acting agree|ably to our Nature but in following the Ex|ample of the great Author of it. It is a Re|flection that will warm the Heart of every good Man to think that he can copy, though it be very faintly, one of the glorious Attributes of the &s;upreme Being, who certainly, however nece&s;&s;ary his Bounty may be for the Service of his Creatures, or the Manife&s;tation of his own Glory, does intend that it &s;hall have ano|ther Effect, and rai&s;e our Imitation; that we &s;hall be in&s;tructed as often as we are a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and make it an invariable Rule <HI>freely to give to others as we our&s;elves have freely received.</HI> We cannot &s;uppo&s;e a more rea&s;onable Cau&s;e of true Joy than an Opportunity afforded us wherein we may imitate the heavenly Example, and a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that we have endeavoured to make the be&s;t U&s;e of it. This Thought, how|ever, will carry a wi&s;e Man no farther than to give him Spirits to pre&s;erve the Character, to lead him to do Good in &s;pite of Calumny and Oppo&s;ition, and to labour that this Image of
<PB N="7" REF="5">God may be wrought in his Heart, again&s;t all Attempts from Cu&s;tom, Sen&s;e, or Sollicitation, to deface it.</P>
<P>WE are a&s;&s;uredly al&s;o encrea&s;ing our own Happine&s;s when we are doing Good to others ina&s;much as we then act in &s;trict Obedience to the Will of God. True Wi&s;dom, in whatever Terms it is &s;et forth, or under what Figures &s;oever it is repre&s;ented, is the Knowledge of the Will of God. The more we have of that Knowledge the wi&s;er we are, and the more we practi&s;e what we know the happier we are. This is the only Wi&s;dom that can give <HI>Length of Days; her Ways alone are the Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and there is no Peace but in her Paths.</HI> We are happy, therefore, when we do Good, becau&s;e we then walk in the Paths of true Wi&s;dom; or, in other Words, becau&s;e we faithfully ob&s;erve the Will, and obey the Com|mands, of an allwi&s;e and almighty Law-giver.</P>
<P>BUT, above all, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that we do truly and &s;en&s;ibly promote our own Hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="6">by Acts of Charity and Benevolence, if we <HI>have Re&s;pect unto the Recompence of Reward,</HI> which is &s;ometimes experienced in this Life, but is promi&s;ed to the next on &s;uch Authority that the very A&s;&s;urance is &s;uperior to any thing we can at pre&s;ent enjoy. Intere&s;t then, a lau|dable Motive where &s;uch Means are u&s;ed, and &s;uch an End propo&s;ed, compels us to the Ex|erci&s;e of Charity, teaching us that a Gift of that Sort is but <HI>lending unto the Lord;</HI> that it will be paid again into our Bo&s;om, <HI>with good Mea&s;ure, pre&s;&s;ed down, &s;haken together, and running over.</HI></P>
<P>IN this happy State of Mind let us ca&s;t our Eyes towards the Regions of Di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ee what a Variety of Objects pre&s;s forward to be relieved: A Variety that will exerci&s;e every Di&s;po&s;ition that is humane and generous, and, at the &s;ame Time, &s;everely reproach all tho&s;e who are wholly governed by the confined Prin|ciples of Partiality and Self-love.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<P>THE OBJECTS which call us now together appear among the foremo&s;t in this &s;orrowful Train; the one Part in the Character of depen|dant Age, the other of helple&s;s Youth: The Children, by innocent Silence, tenderly be&s;peak|ing our Compa&s;&s;ion toward them&s;elves; the Mother, with heart-piercing Angui&s;h, mourn|fully pleading for our A&s;&s;i&s;tance to her&s;elf and her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Little Ones.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible, on an Occa&s;ion of this pub|lic Nature, to avoid taking Notice of the un|common Spirit of Charity that hath diffu&s;ed it|&s;elf, within the&s;e few Years, through the King|dom, but hath more particularly appeared in this City, by many new E&s;tabli&s;hments &s;uited to the Wants and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the People. <HI>We wi&s;h them good Luck, in the Name of the Lord.</HI> May every De&s;ign flouri&s;h which is intended for the Service of Society, and the Honour of God! And may this excellent In&s;titution, which fir&s;t led the way, &s;till maintain its Credit and Ac|count; be looked upon, if I may &s;o &s;peak, as the Mother-Charity; be entitled to the general
<PB N="10" REF="8">Regard, and ever partake of the Bounty of all tho&s;e who love and believe in the Go&s;pel of Peace!</P>
<P>THE Spirit which hath been &s;hewn in the Support of this great and good Work, and the yearly-encrea&s;ing Benefactions prove the Excel|lence and Propriety of it; and truly we cannot &s;uppo&s;e a more general, or a more de&s;erving Object of Regard, than the Widows and Or|phans of tho&s;e who have &s;pent their Lives in promoting the true Happine&s;s of Mankind, by preaching the glad Tidings of Salvation. &mdash; If we have been made &s;en&s;ible of the Greatne&s;s of that Happine&s;s; if we have been taught how we may obtain it; if we have been in&s;tructed how to guard again&s;t tho&s;e Enemies who would oppo&s;e that Pur&s;uit; if we have had our Minds enlarged, our Hearts &s;et at ea&s;e, or our Spirits rai&s;ed to the Exerci&s;e of heavenly Virtues; and This by the Diligence and Fidelity of tho&s;e Mi|ni&s;ters who are &s;et over us, or by the Works of tho&s;e who have heretofore laboured in the Lord, who, being dead, yet &s;peak, Here are we to
<PB N="11" REF="9">&s;hew forth the Spirit of our Gratitude; Here are we to confe&s;s the Benefits we have received: This is the Altar of Thank&s;giving; of Thank&s;|giving, not to the weak and unprofitable Ser|vants, but to the great Lord of all who is of|tentimes plea&s;ed to cut &s;hort the Lives of &s;ome of them, in order to prove the Degree of our Love and Charity, and to &s;ee how far our A&s;|&s;i&s;tance will extend in &s;upplying the Wants and Nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e who repre&s;ent them.</P>
<P>THAT we may do this more effectually, let us take a nearer View of their Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>NOTHING makes Mi&s;ery &s;o &s;harp as the Sud|denne&s;s of it. It never pre&s;&s;es &s;o hard as when it immediately &s;ucceeds a State of Ea&s;e or Enjoy|ment. The Per&s;ons, who&s;e Ca&s;e is under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration, are, in general, the ful|le&s;t In&s;tances of the Deepne&s;s of Di&s;tre&s;s: For before their Trouble comes upon them, even whil&s;t it is hanging over their Heads, you will &s;ee the whole Hou&s;e chearful, contented, ea&s;y, beloved, and re&s;pected; in a Word, the Object
<PB N="12" REF="10">of envied Happine&s;s; the one Parent exerci&s;ed in forming the Morals of his Children, improv|ing their Under&s;tandings, and leading them by gentle Steps into the Knowledge of their Du|ty in all its Branches, to God, to the King, to their Country, to them&s;elves, to their Rela|tions, and to Mankind; the Other employed in the no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary Duties of dome&s;tic Life; Both jointly acting for the good of all, and with parental Affection, not to be expre&s;&s;ed, anti|cipating Schemes of future Pro&s;perity. With the&s;e Family-Cares you find the Father main|taining his public Station by a faithful Di&s;|charge of all its Offices, &s;upporting the Digni|ty of his Function with Honour and E&s;teem: From Education taught to be generous; from Profe&s;&s;ion to be charitable; e&s;pecially the hearty, and, according to his Abilities, the libe|ral Friend of this In&s;titution. When, Oh! hard to be experienced, &s;ome fatal Di&s;ea&s;e (fre|quently the Effect of a too anxious Concern for the Welfare and Happine&s;s of tho&s;e who are &s;o dear to him) puts an End to This Nece&s;|&s;ary Life, and changes, at once, the little hap|py
<PB N="13" REF="11">Dwelling into a Hou&s;e of Mourning and Mi|&s;ery: Of Mi&s;ery indeed, when that Provi&s;ion is taken away which &s;hould &s;upport; and he is cut off who &s;hould direct this Infant-Com|munity. A Scene this, which will draw the Tear of Pity from every Eye; in which it is hard to &s;ay, whether are the more affecting Objects, the elder Children who can feel their Misfortune; or the younger who, by Uncon|cernedne&s;s and Di&s;regard, &s;hew they are alto|gether in&s;en&s;ible of it. But Her melancholy Situation mo&s;t of all will move our Hearts to Compa&s;&s;ion, who not only knows and feels her pre&s;ent Affliction, but is overwhelmed at the Thought of what may hereafter happen from the helple&s;s and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition of her&s;elf and of her Children. And if our Pa&s;&s;ions lead us to &s;ympathize with the Widow in her Grief, our Experience and Knowledge in the World will inform us that her Fears are too well grounded; that &s;evere is their Lot, who, by lo&s;ing their Friend and Guide, have a dark and intricate Path to pur&s;ue; which they, who have the greate&s;t Helps and Encouragements,
<PB N="14" REF="12">find it difficult to keep, and which mu&s;t con&s;e|quently be highly dangerous and perplexed to tho&s;e who are uncoun&s;elled and una&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>HITHER then let Charity, that amiable Chri&s;|tian Grace, bring her well-timed Means; hi|ther ha&s;ten with Relief to tho&s;e, who &s;o tru|ly de&s;erve it. Let her comfort them, when deceitful Friends turn away their Face; and cheri&s;h them under the malignant Scorn of tho&s;e who hold Poverty a Reproach: Let her teach them that there is a God who careth for the Needy; and in&s;truct them to behave with Diligence, Hone&s;ty, and Humility in the Stations that are a&s;&s;igned them; in full A&s;|&s;urance that the Adver&s;ity which they have experienced in their early Years will, by tho&s;e Means, be converted into Joy and Happine&s;s at the la&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Zeal which &s;ome Per&s;ons have exerted in this excellent Work, the Di&s;cretion and Judgment of others, and the beneficent Spirit of many more, have oftentimes produced this
<PB N="15" REF="13">happy Effect; have turned Sorrow into Joy; out of Weakne&s;s have rai&s;ed Strength; and from de&s;titute, though well-principled Children, have enriched the Common-wealth with hone&s;t and u&s;eful Members. Can any Con&s;iderations find a readier Way to your Heart than the&s;e? Can your Pa&s;&s;ions be more warmly worked upon, or your Rea&s;on more fully &s;atisfied, than by an Application of this kind, in Behalf of a Chari|ty &s;o well calculated and conducted as the pre|&s;ent which by its Objects properly exerci&s;es your Pity and Benevolence; by its Oeconomy gives Complacency to the Mind; and by its Effects affords real, la&s;ting, and univer&s;al Ad|vantage?</P>
<P>THUS every Motive that can affect us pleads for its Encouragement. Nature points to it, entreating us not to forget the Mi&s;eries of our Fellow-Creatures; Religion holds it up to our View, and commands us to remember Chri&s;t's Little Ones; and Society atte&s;ts the U&s;efulne&s;s of it by a&s;&s;uring us that it will in|crea&s;e her Glory and Strength.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="14">
<P>THERE is another very powerful Con&s;idera|tion which will have its Weight with us, as in Truth it-ought to have in all De&s;igns that are well intended and faithfully executed: This is &s;ugge&s;ted to us by that Scripture of which the Text is a Part, and in which the Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> makes a &s;ignal Return to certain Ho&s;pi|table Treatment that had been &s;hewn to him; thereby expre&s;&s;ing the Favour which God Al|mighty bears to tho&s;e who pay Regard to the Wants of his Servants.</P>
<P>IT were unnece&s;&s;ary to be particular on a Sto|ry &s;o well known. It will be &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve that there are two or three Circum|&s;tances which agree with this De&s;ign, from whence we may rea&s;onably hope, the Encoura|gers of it, they who <HI>have been careful for us with all this Care,</HI> may al&s;o meet with their Reward.</P>
<P>WE ob&s;erve then that the&s;e Contributions, like the Services of the <HI>Shunamite,</HI> are a free and
<PB N="17" REF="15">voluntary Act, &s;pringing from a fixed Principle of Goodne&s;s, from a De&s;ire to give Glory to God and to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who are in Nece&s;&s;ity; and again, that, the Di&s;po&s;itions being alike, the Objects al&s;o are in both Ca&s;es nearly the &s;ame; for &s;he, like the fir&s;t Promoters of this good Work, thought that the Wants of God's Mini&s;ters and Servants de&s;erved Relief, that it were inexcu&s;able not to attend to them, and that they who&s;e &s;ole Employment it is to ad|mini&s;ter Spiritual Things &s;hould, in return, receive Temporal.</P>
<P>THERE is another &s;imilar Circum&s;tance which we remark in the Pa&s;&s;age before us, namely, that the good Offices, to which the Prophet, through the Power of God, made &s;o ample a Return, were of &s;mall Con&s;ideration, nothing more than a few Conveniencies, and &s;ome occa&s;ional Acts of Ho&s;pitality. Here too, we confe&s;s, the Parallel holds; for though your Zeal hath been warm, and your Benefac|tions liberal; yet, from the great Number of Objects which annually apply, the Relief af|forded
<PB N="18" REF="16">is but incon&s;iderable; e&s;pecially to one Part of them who&s;e Provi&s;ion bears no Propor|tion to their Wants.</P>
<P>IT hath plea&s;ed God to put it into the Heart of &s;ome excellent Per&s;on to con&s;ider more attentively the Circum&s;tances of the Widows, and on conditional, but generous and well-judged Terms, to advance a Sum towards the Increa&s;e of their Stipend. This charitable Spi|rit, though lately &s;hewn, hath already had its Influence, and we pray to God that it may increa&s;e to the Comfort of tho&s;e who have at once to &s;truggle with Age and Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>BUT though we cannot relieve all in the Manner we de&s;ire; yet He, who is to judge and to reward, hath promi&s;ed to accept our be&s;t Endeavours. It is the Good Will that is plea&s;ing to him; it is the Chearfulne&s;s attend|ing our Offering, which is his Delight. When we give hone&s;tly, that is, u&s;e no fal&s;e Rea&s;ons, nor frame &s;elfi&s;h Excu&s;es to dimini&s;h our Di&s;|tributions; when, in &s;hort, we fairly do all
<PB N="19" REF="17">we can in this Cau&s;e, then our Little becomes Great, then may we look for a Recompence, for this is <HI>the Cup of cold Water,</HI> which who|&s;oever faithfully di&s;pen&s;es, the Son of God hath declared, <HI>&s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his Reward.</HI></P>
<P>ALAS! in what wretched Circum&s;tance mu&s;t they &s;tand whom this divine A&s;&s;urance cannot affect; who regard no one but them|&s;elves, and feel no Nece&s;&s;ities but their own!</P>
<P>IT was the good Di&s;po&s;ition of the Per|&s;on applied to in the Text, that gained her a Reward, and it was the Object towards whom that Di&s;po&s;ition was &s;hewn, which made that Reward &s;o great. She offered a Sacrifice to God, &s;mall indeed, but of &s;o &s;weet a &s;melling Savour, and he repaid it an hundred fold, by a Gift that of all others &s;he de&s;ired, which &s;he preferred, we find, to all the Favours that Power, nay, that Maje&s;ty, could be&s;tow; for her Reward was that in which her Soul de|lighted, a Son of her Age, who was &s;ent her in due time; and after he was grown up and
<PB N="20" REF="18">had met his Death by &s;ome Accident or Di&s;|ea&s;e, was rai&s;ed from the Dead, and re&s;tored to her again.</P>
<P>HERE then is the Force of the Application, &mdash; If we bear the &s;ame charitable Spirit, and if it be as religiou&s;ly directed, may we not hope, from the experienced Goodne&s;s of God, <HI>who is not unrighteous that he will for|get our Works and Labour</HI> that <HI>proceedeth of Love,</HI> that he will al&s;o reward us, that he will <HI>be merciful unto us, that he will ble&s;s us, and lift up the Light of his Countenance up|on us?</HI></P>
<P>IT &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, in this Place, to take one Caution along with us, which is, that we are not too &s;anguine in our Expectations; nor imagine, that the Reward of our good Works &s;hall be immediately &s;uited to our pre&s;ent In|clinations; &s;ince it is much to be doubted, from the Prejudice by which we are apt to judge and choo&s;e in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, whether &s;uch a Re|compence would turn to our real Advantage.
<PB N="21" REF="19">We pay our Offering to God, and it is from him we hope for a Return; but it will never become us to pre&s;cribe either the Manner or the Degree of it; We mu&s;t wait his Plea&s;ure and acquie&s;ce in all his Di&s;pen&s;ations, fully per&s;uaded of this &s;acred Truth, that all our Services and good Offices are be&s;t recommend|ed and &s;anctified by Re&s;ignation and Humility.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e Thoughts, and with the&s;e Encou|ragements let us go on with this Labour of Love till the Succe&s;s of it be equal to the Excel|lence. It is a glorious, it is a Chri&s;tian Un|dertaking; let us therefore recommend it, as Chri&s;tians ought to do, by the per&s;ua&s;ive Ex|ample of our Liberality, for by &s;uch Means we mo&s;t effectually expre&s;s our Zeal for its Honour and Pro&s;perity: E&s;pecially let Tho&s;e, who are &s;olely re&s;pected in it, be fir&s;t among the Promoters of it; It is in their Power to become truly &s;o, by adding to their Charity every other Virtue; this will bring Glory to the Work, and convince our Enemies, that it provides for the de&s;titute Families of hone&s;t and
<PB N="22" REF="20">good Men&mdash;And let them pray, yea let them teach their Children to do the &s;ame, that God would be plea&s;ed to pro&s;per this charitable De|&s;ign and to ble&s;s the Friends and Benefactors of it: Or, if in his Providence, he &s;hall think fit to afflict them, or their Po&s;terity, as tho&s;e, now before us, are afflicted, that he would give them Re&s;olution and Patience, the great Support of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Virtue, and the promi&s;ed Reward of that beneficent Spirit, which is exerci&s;ed in <HI>providing</HI> for <HI>the Fatherle&s;s and in healing the broken hearted.</HI></P>
<P>MAY that God, <HI>who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask, or think,</HI> hear the&s;e Petitions; and be&s;tow all his Ble&s;&s;ings up|on us in &s;uch a Manner, as his unnerring Wi&s;dom &s;hall judge mo&s;t conducive to our Happine&s;s and his Glory!</P>
