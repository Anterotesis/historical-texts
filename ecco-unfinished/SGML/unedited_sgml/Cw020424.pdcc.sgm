<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we &s;ee an unprincipled, &s;hamele&s;s bully, <Q>&startq;A dog in fore|head, &endq;and in heart a deer," who endea|vours, by means of a big look, a threat|ening a&s;pect, and a thundering voice, to terrify peaceable men into a compliance with what he has neither a right to de|mand, nor power nor courage to enforce, and who, at the &s;ame time, acts in &s;uch a bungling, &s;tupid manner, as to excite ridi|cule and contempt in place of fear; when we &s;ee &s;uch a ga&s;conading, impudent bluff as this (and that we do every day), we call him a <HI>Blunderbu&s;s</HI>.</Q> But, the reader
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
will not, I hope, have conceived me &s;o devoid of all decency and prudence, as to imagine, even for a moment, that it is in this degrading &s;en&s;e that the name of <HI>Blun|derbu&s;s</HI> has been given to the invaluable col|lection which I here pre&s;ent to the public. <Q>Indeed, it is &s;o evident that I could mean no &s;uch thing, that this declaration &s;eems hardly nece&s;&s;ary; but, as my poor old grand|mother u&s;ed to &s;ay, &startq;a burnt child dreads &endq;the fire," and after the unrelenting &s;e|verities of mi&s;conception and mi&s;con&s;truc|tion, that a humane and commi&s;erating public have &s;o often &s;een me endure, they will think it very natural for me to fear, that what I really intended as a compli|ment, would, if left unexplained, be tor|tured into in&s;ult and abu&s;e, if not into the horrid crime of leze republicani&s;m, at the very idea of which my hair &s;tands on end and my heart dies within me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"But," cry the Democrats, &startq;in what &s;en&s;e then do you apply the word <HI>Blun|derbu&s;s?</HI> Come, come, Mr. Peter, none &endq;of your &s;huffling."</Q>&mdash;Silence, you yelp|ing devils; go growl in your dark kennel; &s;link into your &s;traw, and leave me to my reader: I'll warrant I explain my&s;elf to his &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">Writings of a ho&s;tile nature are often me|taphorically expre&s;&s;ed, in proportion to the noi&s;e they make, by different in&s;truments that act by explo&s;ion. Thus it is, for in&s;tance, that in impotent lampoon is called a <HI>Pop|gun</HI>, and that a biting paragraph or epi|gram, confined to a &s;mall circle, is termed a <HI>Squib;</HI> and thus it is, that, ri&s;ing in due progre&s;&s;ion, the collection of CITIZEN ADET's Notes and Cockade Proclamation is denominated a <HI>Blunderbu&s;s</HI>, a &s;pecies of fire arms that exceeds all others, managea|ble by a &s;ingle hand, in the noi&s;e of its di&s;charge.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>The following note was publi&s;hed in Bache's Gazette of <HI>31</HI>&s;t <HI>Oct. 1796</HI>, without the approbation or con|sent of the American Government.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="subhead">AUTHENTIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary of the French Republic, in conformity to the orders of his government, has the honour of tran&s;|mitting to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate of the United States, a re&s;olution taken by the executive direc|tory of the French Republic, on the 14th Me&s;&s;i|dor, 4th year, relative to the conduct which the &s;hips of war of the Republic are to hold towards neutral ve&s;&s;els. The flag of the Republic will treat the flag of neutrals in the &s;ame manner as they &s;hall &s;uffer it to be treated by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">The &s;entiments which the American govern|ment have manife&s;ted to the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, do not permit him to doubt, that they will &s;ee in its true light, this mea&s;ure, as far as it may concern the United States, that it is dictated by imperious circum&s;tances, and approv|ed by ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Great Britain, during the war &s;he has carried on again&s;t the Republic, has not cea&s;ed u&s;ing eve|ry means in her power to add to that &s;courge, &s;courges &s;till more terrible. She has u&s;ed the well known liberality of the French nation to the detriment of that nation. Knowing how faithful France has always been in the ob&s;ervance of her treaties&mdash;knowing that it was a principle of the Republic to re&s;pect the flag of all nations, the Briti&s;h government, from the beginning of the war, has cau&s;ed neutral ve&s;&s;els, and in particular American ve&s;&s;els, to be detained, taking them in|to their ports, and dragged from them French|men and French property.&mdash;France, bound by a treaty with the United States, could find only a real di&s;advantage in the articles of that treaty, which cau&s;ed to be re&s;pected as American pro|perty, Engli&s;h property found on board American ve&s;&s;els. They had a right, under this con&s;ideration, to expect, that America would take &s;teps in favour of her violated neutrality. One of the predece&s;&s;ors of the under&s;igned, in July 1793, applied on this &s;ubject to the government of the United States, but he was not &s;ucce&s;sful. Neverthele&s;s, the na|tional convention, who by their decree of the 9th May, 1793, had ordered the &s;eizure of enemy's property on board neutral ve&s;&s;els, declaring at the &s;ame time, that the mea&s;ure &s;hould cea&s;e when the Engli&s;h &s;hould re&s;pect neutral flags, had ex|cepted,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
on the 23d of the &s;ame month, the Ame|ricans from the operation of this general order. But the convention was obliged &s;oon to repeal the law which contained this exception &s;o favourable to Americans.&mdash;The manner in which the Engli&s;h conducted them&s;elves&mdash;the manife&s;t intentions they had to &s;top the exportation of provi&s;ions from America to France, rendered it unavoidable.</P>
<P>The national convention, by this, had re&s;tored the equilibrium of neutrality which England had de&s;troyed&mdash;had di&s;charged their duty in a manner ju&s;tified by a thou&s;and pa&s;t examples, as well as by the nece&s;&s;ity of the then exi&s;ting moment. They might, therefore, to recal the orders they had given to &s;eize enemy's property on board American ve&s;&s;els, have waited till the Briti&s;h go|vernment had fir&s;t definitively revoked the &s;ame order, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion only of which was produced by the embargo laid by congre&s;s the 26th of March, 1794. But as &s;oon as they were inform|ed, that, under orders of the government of the United States, Mr. Jay was directed to re|mon&s;trate again&s;t the vexatory mea&s;ures of the Engli&s;h, they gave orders, by the law of the 13th Nivo&s;e, 3d year, to the &s;hips of war of the Re|public, to re&s;pect American ve&s;&s;els; and the committee of public &s;afety, in their explanatory re&s;olve, of the 14th of the &s;ame month, ha&s;tened to &s;anction the &s;ame principles. The national con|vention and the committee of public &s;afety had every rea&s;on to believe, that this open and liberal conduct would determine the United States to u&s;e every effort to put a &s;top to the vexations impo&s;ed upon their commerce, to the injury of the French Republic. They were deceived in this hope&mdash; and though the treaty of friend&s;hip, commerce,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
and navigation, between Great Britain and the United States had been &s;igned &s;ix weeks before France adopted the mea&s;ure I have ju&s;t &s;poken of, the Engli&s;h did not abandon the plan they had formed, and continued to &s;top and carry into their ports all American ve&s;&s;els bound to French ports, or returning from them.</P>
<P>This conduct was the &s;ubject of a note, which the under&s;igned addre&s;&s;ed, on the 7th Vende|maire, 4th year, [29th September, 1795, O. S.] to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The remon&s;trances which it contained, were founded on the duties of neutrality, upon the principles which Mr. Jeffer&s;on had laid down in his letter to Mr. Pinck|ney, dated the 13th September, 1793. Yet this note has remained without an an&s;wer, though recalled to the remembrance of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate by a di&s;patch of the 9th Germinal, 4th year, [29th March, 1796, O. S.] and American ve&s;&s;els, bound to French ports, or returning from them, have &s;till been &s;eized by the Engli&s;h. Indeed more&mdash; they have added a new vexation to tho&s;e they had already impo&s;ed upon Americans.&mdash;They have impre&s;&s;ed &s;eamen from on board American ve&s;|&s;els, and have thus found the means of &s;trength|ening their crews at the expen&s;e of the Ameri|cans, without the government of the United States having made known to the under&s;igned the &s;teps they had taken to obtain &s;atisfaction for this violation of neutrality, &s;o hurtful to the intere&s;ts of France, as the under&s;igned had &s;et forth in his di&s;patches to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate of the 9th Germinal, 4th year, [29th March, 1796, O. S.] 19th Germinal, [8th April, 1796,] and fir&s;t Flo|real, [20th April, 1796,] which have remained without an an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">The French government, then, finds it&s;elf, with re&s;pect to America, at the pre&s;ent time, in circum&s;tances &s;imilar to tho&s;e of 1793; and if it &s;ees it&s;elf obliged to abandon, with re&s;pect to them and neutral powers in general, the favoura|ble line of conduct they had pur&s;ued, and to adopt different mea&s;ures, the blame &s;hould fall upon the Briti&s;h government.&mdash;It is their conduct which the French government has been obliged to follow.</P>
<P>The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary con|ceives it his duty to remark to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, that the neutral governments of the allies of the Republic have nothing to fear as to the treatment of their flag by the French, &s;ince, if keeping within the bounds of their neutrality, they cau&s;e the rights of that neutrality to be re|&s;pected by the Engli&s;h, the Republic will re&s;pect them. But if through weakne&s;s, partiality or other motives, they &s;hould &s;uffer the Engli&s;h to &s;port with that neutrality, and turn it to their ad|vantage, could they then complain, when France, to re&s;tore the balance of neutrality to its equilibri|um, &s;hall act in the &s;ame manner as the Engli&s;h? No, certainly; for the neutrality of a nation con|&s;i&s;ts in granting to belligerent powers the &s;ame advantages, and that neutrality no longer exi&s;ts, when, in the cour&s;e of the war, that neutral na|tion grants to one of the belligerent powers, ad|vantages not &s;tipulated by treaties anterior to the war, or &s;uffers that power to &s;eize upon them. The neutral government cannot then complain if the other belligerent power will enjoy advan|tages which its enemy enjoys, or, if it &s;eizes on them; otherwi&s;e that neutral government would
<PB N="10" REF="11">
deviate, with re&s;pect to it, from the line of neu|trality and would become its enemy.</P>
<P>The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary thinks it u&s;ele&s;s further to develope the&s;e principles. He does not doubt that the &s;ecretary of &s;tate feels all their force, and that the government of the United States will maintain from all violation a neutrality which France has always re&s;pected, and will always re&s;pect when her enemies do not make it turn to her detriment.</P>
<P>The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary em|braces this opportunity of reiterating to the &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate the a&s;&s;urances of his e&s;teem, and in|forms him, at the &s;ame time, that he will cau&s;e this note to be printed, in order to make publicly known the motives which, at the pre&s;ent juncture, influences the French Republic.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Department of State, <DATE>November 1&s;t, 1796.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the re|ceipt of your note of the 27th ult. covering a decree of the executive directory of the French Republic, concerning the commerce of neutral nations.</P>
<P>This decree makes no di&s;tinction between neu|tral powers who can claim only the rights &s;ecured to them by the laws of nations, and others, be|tween whom and the French Republic, treaties have impo&s;ed &s;pecial obligations. Where no
<PB N="12" REF="13">
treaties exi&s;t, the Republic by &s;eizing and confi&s;|cating the property of their enemies found on board neutral ve&s;&s;els, would only exerci&s;e an acknowledged right under the law of nations. If towards &s;uch neutral nations, the French Repub|lic has forborne to exerci&s;e this right, the forbear|ance has been perfectly gratuitous. The United States by virtue of their treaty of commerce with France, &s;tand on different ground.</P>
<P>In the year 1778, France voluntarily entered into a commercial treaty with us, on principles of perfect reciprocity, and expre&s;sly &s;tipulating <HI>that free &s;hips &s;hould make free goods</HI>. That is, if France &s;hould be at war with any nation with whom the United States &s;hould be at peace, the goods (except contraband) and the per&s;ons of her enemies (&s;oldiers in actual &s;ervice excepted) found on board the ve&s;&s;els of the United States, were to be free from capture. That, on the other hand, if the United States &s;hould engage in war with any nation, while France remained at peace, then the goods (except contraband) and the per|&s;ons of our enemies (&s;oldiers in actual &s;ervice excepted) found on board French ve&s;&s;els, were al&s;o to be free from capture. This is plainly expre&s;&s;ed in the twenty-third article of that trea|ty; and demon&s;trates that the reciprocity thereby &s;tipulated, was to operate at <HI>different periods</HI>, that is, at one time in favour of one of the contract|ing parties, and of the other at another time. At the pre&s;ent time, the United States being at peace, they po&s;&s;e&s;s, by the treaty, the right of carrying the goods of the enemies of France without &s;ub|jecting them to capture. But what do the &s;pirit of the decree of the executive directory and the current of your ob&s;ervations require? That the
<PB N="13" REF="14">
United States &s;hould now gratuitou&s;ly renounce this right. And what rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned for de|nying to us the enjoyment of this right? Your own words furni&s;h the an&s;wer. <Q>&startq;France <HI>bound by treaty</HI> to the United States, <HI>could find only a real di&s;advantage</HI> in the articles of that treaty which cau&s;ed to be re&s;pected as American pro|perty, Engli&s;h property found on board Ame|rican &endq;ve&s;&s;els."</Q>&mdash;This requi&s;ition, and the rea|&s;on a&s;&s;igned to &s;upport it, alike excite &s;urpri&s;e. The American government, Sir, con&s;cious of the purity of its intentions, of its impartial ob&s;erv|ance of the laws of neutrality, and of its invio|lable regard to treaties, cannot, for a moment admit, that it has forfeited the right to claim a reciprocal ob&s;ervance of &s;tipulations on the part of the French Republic; who&s;e friend&s;hip more|over, it has ever cultivated with perfect &s;incerity. This right, formerly infringed by a decree of the national convention, was recogni&s;ed anew by the repeal of that decree. Why it &s;hould be again que&s;tioned, we are at a lo&s;s to determine. We are ignorant of any new re&s;traints on our com|merce by the Briti&s;h government; on the contra|ry, we po&s;&s;e&s;s recent official information, <HI>that no new order has been i&s;&s;ued</HI>. The captures made by the Briti&s;h, of American ve&s;&s;els having French pro|perty on board, are warranted by the law of na|tions. The force and operation of this law was contemplated by France and the United States, when they formed their treaty of commerce; and their &s;pecial &s;tipulation on this point was meant as an exception to an univer&s;al rule. Neither our weakne&s;s nor our &s;trength, have any choice, when the que&s;tion concerns the ob&s;ervance of a known rule of the law of nations.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">You are plea&s;ed to remark, that the conduct of Great Britain in capturing American ve&s;&s;els bound to and from French ports, had been the &s;ubject of a note, which on the 29th of Septem|ber, 1793, you addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, but which remained without an an&s;wer. Very &s;ufficient rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for the omi&s;&s;i|on. The &s;ubject, in all its re&s;pects, had been already officially and publicly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the principles and ultimate mea&s;ures of the United States, founded upon their indi&s;putable rights, were as publicly fixed. But if the &s;ubject had not, by the previous di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, been already exhau&s;ted, can it be a matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that there &s;hould be a repugnance to an&s;wer a letter containing &s;uch in&s;inuations as the&s;e?&mdash;<Q>&startq;It mu&s;t then be clear to every man, who will di&s;card prejudices, love, hatred, and in a word, all the pa&s;&s;ions which lead the judgment a&s;tray, that the French Republic would have a right to complain, if the American government &s;uffer|ed the Engli&s;h to interrupt the commercial re|lations, which exi&s;t between her and the Unit|ed States; if by a <HI>perfidious conde&s;cen&s;ion</HI>, it permitted the Engli&s;h to violate a right which it ought <HI>for its own honour and intere&s;t</HI> to defend; if under the <HI>cloak of neutrality</HI>, it pre&s;ented to England a poignard to cut the throat of its faithful ally; if, in fine, <HI>partaking in the ty|rannical and homicidal rage of Great Britain, it concurred</HI> to plunge the people of France &endq;into the horrors of famine."</Q> For the &s;ake of pre&s;erving harmony, &s;ilence was preferred to a comment upon the&s;e in&s;inuations.</P>
<P>You are al&s;o plea&s;ed to refer to your letters of March and April la&s;t, relative to impre&s;&s;es of
<PB N="15" REF="16">
American &s;eamen by Briti&s;h &s;hips, and complain, that the government of the United States had not made known to you the &s;teps they had taken to obtain &s;atisfaction. This, Sir, was a matter, which concerned only that government. As an inde|pendent nation, we were not bound to render an account to any other, of the mea&s;ures we deemed proper for the protection of our own citizens; &s;o long as there was not the &s;lighte&s;t ground to &s;u&s;pect that the government ever acquie&s;ced in any aggre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But permit me to recur to the &s;ubject of the decree of the executive directory.</P>
<P>As before ob&s;erved, we are officially informed, that the Briti&s;h government have i&s;&s;ued no new or|ders for capturing the ve&s;&s;els of the United States. <Q>We are al&s;o officially informed, that on the appear|ance of the notification of that decree, the mini&s;ter of the United States at Paris applied for informa|tion &startq;whether orders were i&s;&s;ued for the &s;eizure of neutral ve&s;&s;els; and was informed that no &s;uch order was i&s;&s;ued, and further, that none &s;uch would be i&s;&s;ued, in ca&s;e the Briti&s;h did not &endq;&s;eize our ve&s;&s;els."</Q> This communication from the mini&s;ter of the United States at Paris to their mini&s;ter in London, was dated $word$ $8th of Augu&s;t. But the decree of the direc$ $word$ bears date the 14th Me&s;&s;idor, an&s;wering to the &s;econd of July. The&s;e circum&s;tances, together with &s;ome ob&s;erva|tions in your note, leave the American govern|ment in a &s;tate of uncertainty of the real inten|tions of the government of France. Allow me then to a&s;k, whether, in the actual &s;tate of things, our commerce is con&s;idered as liable to &s;uffer any new re&s;trictions on the part of the French Repub|lic? Whether the re&s;traints now exerci&s;ed by the
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Briti&s;h government are con&s;idered as of a nature to ju&s;tify a denial of tho&s;e rights, which are pledged to us by our treaty with your nation? Whether orders have been actually given to the &s;hips of war and privateers of the French Repub+lic, to capture the ve&s;&s;els of the United States? And what, if they exi&s;t, are the preci&s;e terms of tho&s;e orders?</P>
<P>The&s;e que&s;tions, Sir, you will &s;ee, are highly intere&s;ting to the United States. It is with ex|treme concern, that the government finds it&s;elf reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king an explanation of this nature, and if it &s;hall be informed, that a new line of conduct is to be adopted towards this country, on the ground of th$ decree re|ferred to, its &s;urpri&s;e will equal its regret, that principles &s;hould now be que&s;tioned, which, after repeated di&s;cu&s;&s;ions both here and in France, have been demon&s;trated to be founded, as we con|ceive, on the obligations of impartial neutrality, of &s;tipulations by treaty, and of the law of na|tions.&mdash;I hope, Sir, you will find it convenient, by an early an&s;wer, to remove the &s;u&s;pen&s;e in which the government of the United States is now held on the que&s;tions above &s;tated.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this letter by one remark on the &s;ingularity of your cau&s;ing the publication of your note. As it concerned the United States, it was properly addre&s;&s;ed to its government, to which alone pertained the right of communicat|ing it, in &s;uch time and manner as it &s;hould think fit, to the citizens of the United States.</P>

<HEAD>AUTHENTIC. The mini&s;ter plenipotentiary of the French Re|public near the United States of America, to the French citizens who re&s;ide or travel in the &s;aid United States.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the dawn of our revolution, the tri|coloured cockade has been the rallying point of tho&s;e energetic men, who&s;e generous efforts gave the fir&s;t blows to arbitrary power. At their call, the French nation, bent for centuries under the yoke, &s;hook off that long drow&s;ine&s;s, twenty-four millions of men adopted that augu&s;t &s;ymbol, they exclaimed, "we &s;hall be free," and all op|po&s;ition was defeated, and the throne tumbled down in the du&s;t, and all Europe armed again&s;t them has been vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Republic decorates all her citizens with tho&s;e national colours, the &s;acre$ &s;ymbol of liber|ty which they have won.</P>
<P>Frenchmen who are ab&s;ent from their native land, ought not, amid&s;t nations allied with theirs, to lay a&s;ide the di&s;tinctive mark which, by making them known, &s;ecures to them the protection and reciprocal re&s;pect guaranteed by our treaties with tho&s;e nations.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">Tho&s;e who, from a guilty indifference, &s;hould &s;light that right, exempt them&s;elves from that duty&mdash;tho&s;e could lay no claim to that protection, they would renounce the &s;upport of the agents of the Republic. But, citizens, I am per&s;uaded that at the call of the mini&s;ter of the French Repub|lic, you will ha&s;ten to put on the &s;ymbol of a liberty, which is the fruit of eight years toils and privations, and of five years victories.</P>
<P>Thus, you will draw a line of demarkation between you and tho&s;e contemptible beings, who&s;e unfeeling hearts are callous to the &s;acred name of native land, to the noble pride with which the freeman is animated by the &s;en&s;e of his indepen|dence.</P>
<P>Thus, you will &s;ignalize tho&s;e &s;till more de|graded beings, who being &s;old to the enemies of the Republic, drag from clime to clime, a life overwhelmed with mi&s;ery and contempt&mdash;wretches whom hi&s;tory will not call to remembrance, ex|cept to perpetuate their di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the French chanceries, the national protection, will not be granted to any Frenchman but tho&s;e, who, perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the dignity attached to the title of citizen, &s;hall take a pride in wearing con&s;tantly the tri-coloured cockade. The executive directory of the French Republic have pronounced thus. Being the organ of their deci&s;ions, I communicate them with plea&s;ure to my fellow-citizens. As for tho&s;e who, although Frenchmen born, have cea&s;ed to be Frenchmen, I do not &s;peak to them; the public voice will in|form them of their exclu&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="subhead">AUTHENTIC. Tran&s;lation of a note from the mini&s;ter of the French Republic, to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate of the United States.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Legation of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<P>THE under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary of the French Republic, now fulfils to the &s;e|cretary of &s;tate of the United States, a painful but &s;acred duty. He claims, in the name of
<PB N="21" REF="22">
American honour, in the name of the faith of treaties, the execution of that contract which a&s;|&s;ured to the United States their exi&s;tence, and which France regarded as the pledge of the mo&s;t &s;acred union between two people, the free&s;t upon earth: In a word, he announces to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate the re&s;olution of a government, terrible to its enemies, but generous to its allies.</P>
<P>It would have been plea&s;ing to the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, to have only to expre&s;s, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, the attachment which his government bears to the American people, the vows which it forms for their pro&s;perity, for their happine&s;s. His heart therefore is grieved at the circum&s;tances which impo&s;e upon him a dif|ferent ta&s;k. With regret he finds him&s;elf com|pelled to &s;ub&s;titute the tone of reproach for the language of friend&s;hip. With regret al&s;o his go|vernment has ordered him to take that tone; but that very friend&s;hip has rendered it indi&s;pen&s;able. Its obligations &s;acred to men, are as &s;acred to governments; and if a friend offended by a friend, can ju&s;tly complain, the government of the United States, after the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary &s;hall have traced the catalogue of grievances of the French Republic, will not be &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the executive directory manife&s;t|ing their too ju&s;t di&s;contents.</P>
<P>When Europe ro&s;e up again&s;t the Republic at its birth, menaced it with all the horrors of war and of famine; when on every &s;ide the French could not calculate upon any but enemies, their thoughts turned towards America; a &s;weet &s;enti|ment then mingled it&s;elf with tho&s;e proud &s;enti|ments, which the pre&s;ence of danger and the de|&s;ire
<PB N="22" REF="23">
of repelling it produced in their hearts. In America, they &s;aw friends. Tho&s;e who went to brave tempe&s;ts and death upon the ocean, forgot all dangers in order to indulge the hope of vi&s;it|ing that American continent, where, for the fir&s;t time, the French colours had been di&s;played in favour of liberty. Under the guarantee of the law of nations, under the protecting &s;hade of a &s;olemn treaty, they expected to find in the ports of the United States an a&s;ylum as &s;ure as at home; they thought, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, there to find a &s;econd country. The French go|vernment thought as they did. Oh! hope, wor|thy of faithful people, how ha&s;t thou been de|ceived! So far from offering to the French the &s;uccours which friend&s;hip might have given with|out compromitting it, the American government, in this re&s;pect, violated the letter of treaties.</P>
<P>The 17th article of the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778, &s;tates, that French ve&s;&s;els of war, and tho&s;e of the United States, as well as tho&s;e which &s;hall have been armed for war by in|dividuals of the two States, may freely conduct where they plea&s;e the prizes they &s;hall have made upon their enemies, without being &s;ubject to any admiralty or other duty; without the &s;aid ve&s;&s;els, on entering into the harbours or ports of France, or of the United States, being liable to be arre&s;ted or &s;eized, or the officers of tho&s;e places taking cogni&s;ance of the validity of the &s;aid prizes: which may depart and be conducted freely and in full liberty to the places expre&s;&s;ed in their commi&s;&s;ions, which the captains of the &s;aid ve&s;|&s;els &s;hall be obliged to &s;how: and that on the con|trary, no &s;helter or refuge &s;hall be given to tho&s;e who &s;hall have made prizes upon the French or
<PB N="23" REF="24">
Americans; and that if they &s;hould be forced by &s;tre&s;s of weather or the danger of the &s;ea to en|ter, they &s;hall be made to depart as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>In contempt of the&s;e &s;tipulations, the French privateers have been arre&s;ted in the United States as well as their prizes; the tribunals have taken cogni&s;ance of the validity or invalidity of tho&s;e prizes. It were vain to &s;eek to ju&s;tify the&s;e pro|ceedings under the pretext of the right of vindi|cating the compromitted neutrality of the United States. The facts about to be &s;tated will prove, that this pretext has been the &s;ource of &s;hocking per&s;ecutions again&s;t the French privateers, and that the conduct of the federal government has been but a &s;eries of violations of the 17th article of the treaty of 1778.</P>
<P>On the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1793, a circular letter of the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury was &s;ent to all the collectors of the cu&s;toms. It accompanied regu|lations adopted by the pre&s;ident, prohibiting all armaments in favour of the belligerent powers. The&s;e regulations immediately acquired the force of law, and the agents of the government and the tribunals concurred in their execution. They gave them a retro&s;pective effect, and cau&s;ed to be &s;eized, in the ports of the United States, the arm|ed ve&s;&s;els and prizes which had come in prior to that time. But even before the&s;e regulations, adopted by the pre&s;ident, had e&s;tabli&s;hed any rule whatever upon the prohibition of armaments, the tribunals had already, by order of the govern|ment, a&s;&s;umed the cogni&s;ance of prizes made by French ve&s;&s;els. (No. 1.) One of the pre|dece&s;&s;ors of the under&s;igned prote&s;ted again&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="25">
this, but in vain. The tribunals &s;till continued their pro&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>On the 3d of December, 1793, the pre&s;ident a&s;ked of congre&s;s a law confirming the mea&s;ures contained in the letter from the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, above mentioned. (No. 2.) This law was pa&s;&s;ed the 5th June, 1794. What was its re&s;ult? In con&s;equence of this law, the great|er part of the French privateers have been arre&s;t|ed, as well as their prizes, not upon formal de|po&s;itions, not upon e&s;tabli&s;hed te&s;timony, not upon a nece&s;&s;ary body of proofs, but upon the &s;imple information of the con&s;ul of one of the powers at war with the French Republic, fre|quently upon that of &s;ailors of the enemy pow|ers, &s;ometimes according to the orders of the governors, but often upon the demand of the di&s;trict attorneys, who a&s;&s;ert, upon principles avowed by the government, (No. 3.) that their conviction was &s;ufficient to authorize them, with|out complaint or regular information, to cau&s;e the privateers to be pro&s;ecuted, in virtue of the law above mentioned. (No. 4.)</P>
<P>When the mini&s;ters of the Republic have a&s;k|ed ju&s;tice of the government for the vexations experienced by the privateers, in contempt of the 17th article of the treaty, they have never been able to obtain &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Thus, when on the 9th Fructidor, 3d year, (26th Augu&s;t, 1794) the predece&s;&s;or of the under|&s;igned, addre&s;&s;ed a complaint to the government on this &s;ubject, the &s;ecretary of &s;tate an&s;wered, on the 3d September, 1794, by a phra&s;e indica|tive of delay.</P>
<P>Thus, when the &s;ame mini&s;ter on the 27th Ven|demaire, 3d year (17th October, 1794,) re|minded
<PB N="25" REF="26">
the &s;ecretary of &s;tate of the means he had propo&s;ed to him, for putting an end to the mea&s;ures adopted again&s;t the French privateers; when he cau&s;ed him to &s;ee that this means, which con&s;i&s;ted in requiring &s;ecurity from tho&s;e who claimed the prizes as illegal, would prevent the enemies of the Republic from in&s;tituting &s;o many &s;uits, of which they them&s;elves perceived the inju&s;tice; he obtained no other an&s;wer than that his propo&s;ition relative to &s;ecurities was in|admi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>When on the 13th Floreal, 3d year, the &s;ame mini&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e terms, in a letter to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate: <Q>&startq;You have al|ledged, Sir, that the executive of the United States cannot interfere in the affairs of which the tribunals have taken cogni&s;ance. In ad|mitting this objection for all the bu&s;ine&s;s now in &s;uit, I do not the le&s;s think that your go|vernment could by general mea&s;ures, bring back the juri&s;diction of the American tribu|nals, concerning prizes made by our ve&s;&s;els, within the limits pre&s;cribed by our treaties, which make part of the &s;upreme law of the land: it might make known that the facility with which your courts of admiralty admit, without di&s;tinc|tion, all the chicanery which our enemies cre|ate again&s;t us, in the pre&s;ent war, is evidently &endq;contrary to the &s;pirit of the treaty."</Q> The go|vernment paid no attention to the&s;e reflections, and the an&s;wer of the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, merely notices the particular fact which had occa&s;ioned the note of Citizen Fauchet.</P>
<P>What was the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipo|tentiary able to obtain in the affair of the Ca&s;&s;ius and of the Vengeance? Nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">The government of the United States mu&s;t have &s;een however, by the claims which the mi|ni&s;ters of the Republic addre&s;&s;ed to it, and by the great number of facts, of which it has had a knowledge, how much the execution of the mea|&s;ures of the pre&s;ident, and of the law of the 5th June, 1794, was contrary to the 17th article of the treaty; how much the agency of the tribunals, who ought not to have any cogni&s;ance of the va|lidity or invalidity of prizes, tended to annul that article, and to deprive the Republic of the advantage which it a&s;&s;ures to her. In fact, was it not evident, that when the powers at war with the Republic had the privilege, in virtue of the law of the 5th of June, 1794, of cau&s;ing to be arre&s;ted the privateers and their prizes, of de|taining them in the ports of the United States, of ruining them by con&s;iderable co&s;ts, by the exce&s;|&s;ive expen&s;es which they occa&s;ioned them, they drew from that privilege an immen&s;e advantage, to the detriment of France? Doubtle&s;s it was of little import to them, that &s;ometimes the privateers obtained ju&s;tice, in the la&s;t re&s;ort, if they detain|ed the privateer for a length of time, and if they, by that means, &s;heltered from their pur&s;uit the commerce of the enemy of France. The neutrality of the United States, in this ca&s;e, was altogether to their advantage; and the federal government, on &s;eeing this &s;tate of things, &s;hould, out of re&s;pect to its neutrality and to treaties, &s;olicit from the congre&s;s the means of conciliat|ing the duties of the former with the obligations of the latter.</P>
<P>The government very well knew how to &s;olicit the law of the 5th of June, 1794, when that law was to bear on France alone, when it gave to the
<PB N="27" REF="28">
tribunals a right which has been abu&s;ed, and which enables them to decide upon prizes: why, on &s;eeing the inconveniencies of this law, has it not endeavoured to remedy them? Should it wait to be &s;olicited on this head? Should it not anticipate all claims, and when tho&s;e were pre&s;ented by the mini&s;ters of the Republic, &s;hould it not do ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if the government had been impartial, as it has pretended to be, it would not have adopt|ed that &s;low and circuitous mode, &s;o favourable to the enemies of France, for deciding the ca&s;es relative to its neutrality; it would have preferred the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by Mr. Jeffer&s;on, on the 25th of June, 1793, to the mini&s;ter of the Repub|lic: the&s;e mea&s;ures were &s;imple, they were in conformity with the duties of neutrality and the intere&s;ts of the Republic.</P>
<P>The federal government had decided que&s;tions which intere&s;ted its neutrality, upon informations furni&s;hed by the &s;tate governors and the agents of the Republic; the prizes remained in the hands of the French con&s;ul, until this deci&s;ion took place; the &s;tipulations of the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, were not violated; and the government at the &s;ame time &s;atisfied the obligations of duty and ju&s;tice. In vain would it &s;ay, that it had not this power. Notwith&s;tanding the law of 5th June, 1794, giving to the tribunal the right of taking cogni&s;ance of ca&s;es in which neutrality had been violated, did not the pre&s;ident on the 21&s;t of June, 1794, decide that the &s;hip William, taken out of the limits of the waters of the United States, &s;hould be delivered to the captor; and on the 3d July, 1794, did he not decide that the Pilgrim had been taken in the waters of the United States, and that of cour&s;e &s;he &s;hould be given up to the
<PB N="28" REF="29">
owners? In the&s;e ca&s;es the pre&s;ident not only de|cided on matters, the cogni&s;ance of which had been con&s;igned to the tribunals, but likewi&s;e gave a retro&s;pective effect to his own deci&s;ion upon the protecting line of the United States, which was not notified to the mini&s;ter of the Republic, till the 8th of November, 1793.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with permitting the 17th article of the treaty to be violated by its agents and tribu|nals, the federal government al&s;o &s;uffered the En|gli&s;h to avail them&s;elves of advantages interdicted to them by that article. They armed in the ports of the United States, brought in, and repaired their prizes, and in a word found in them a certain a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>Thus the Engli&s;h privateer Tru&s;ty, Capt. Hall, was armed at Baltimore to cruize again&s;t the French, and &s;ailed notwith&s;tanding the complaints of the con&s;ul of the Republic. At Charle&s;ton, one Bermudian ve&s;&s;el, &s;everal Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and one Dutch ve&s;&s;el, from the 24th May to the 6th June 1793, took in cannon for their defence, and &s;ailed without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>What an&s;wer did the government give to the repre&s;entations of the mini&s;ter of the French Re|public in this re&s;pect? He &s;aid that the&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed &s;o &s;uddenly, it was not able to have them arre&s;ted. But the treaty was not the le&s;s violated. Some of the inhabitants of the United States had aided in the&s;e illegal armaments: What mea&s;ures were taken again&s;t them? Was any &s;earch made to di&s;cover them, to pro&s;ecute them? Never, and yet the government of the United States no &s;oon|er learned that, in con&s;equence of an implied &s;tipulation which the treaty of Ver&s;ailles &s;eemed to contain, the French were arming in the ports
<PB N="29" REF="30">
of the United States, than the mo&s;t energetic or|ders were &s;ent for &s;topping the&s;e armaments. Even citizens of the United States were impri&s;on|ed upon &s;u&s;picion that they had participated in them. The mini&s;ter cannot omit citing here the following pa&s;&s;age of a letter from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, Edmund Randolph, to Mr. Hammond, dated 2d June 1794. <Q>&startq;On a &s;ugge&s;tion that citizens of the United States had taken part in the act, [he &s;peaks of the armaments in the United States] one who was de&s;ignated, was in&s;tantly committed to pri&s;on for pro&s;ecution: one or two others have been &s;ince named and com|mitted in like manner, and &s;hould it appear, that there were &s;till others, no mea&s;ures would &endq;be &s;pared to bring them to ju&s;tice."</Q> What more could the American government do in fa|vour of the Engli&s;h, if they had a &s;imilar treaty to that with France, and had been &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the advantages a&s;&s;ured to her by po&s;itive &s;tipu|lations?</P>
<P>However, in contempt of the&s;e very &s;tipula|tions, the Argonaut, an Engli&s;h &s;hip of war, in January 1795, conduced into Lynnhaven bay, the French corvette L'E&s;perance, which &s;he had taken upon the coa&s;t; &s;he there had her repaired, in order to &s;end her on a crui&s;e. Letters were in con&s;equence written by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate to the governor of Virginia and to Mr. Hammond. What was the re&s;ult? Nothing. On the 29th of May 1795, the federal government had not yet done any thing po&s;itive as to the acts which pro|duced the complaint of the mini&s;ter of the Repub|lic. <Q>The &s;ecretary of &s;tate announced &startq;that the&s;e facts &s;hall be examined, and that if they are verified, the federal government will not be in
<PB N="30" REF="31">
&endq;the rear of its obligations."</Q> To that has the reparation demanded by the Republic been limit|ed.</P>
<P>What are we to think of the&s;e delays, when we &s;ee the officers of the government acting with &s;o much activity again&s;t the French, on the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion that they have violated the neutrality&mdash; when in his letter of 29th April 1794, the &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate an&s;wers the complaints of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter&mdash;<Q>&startq;We have received no intelligence of the particular facts to which you refer: But to prevent all unnece&s;&s;ary circuity in fir&s;t inquir|ing into them and next tran&s;mitting to this city the re&s;ult, the proper in&s;tructions will be given &endq;to act, without further directions."</Q> How did the federal government conduct towards the au|tumn of 1794? The Engli&s;h frigate Terp&s;ichore took the privateer La Montagne in the port of Norfolk. The French vice con&s;ul claimed the execution of the treaty, of the governor of Virgi|nia: the governor an&s;wered him, that he would have the nece&s;&s;ary inve&s;tigation made, and would afterwards take the proper mea&s;ures. The pre|dece&s;&s;or of the under&s;igned then interpo&s;ed with the federal government; and the &s;ecretary of &s;tate a&s;&s;ured him, that he wrote to the governor of Virginia to have ju&s;tice rendered. But this ju&s;tice was limited to inve&s;tigations made with &s;uch &s;lowne&s;s, that five months after, this affair was not fini&s;hed; and on the 24th February 1795, the &s;ecretary of &s;tate contented him&s;elf with &s;ending to the predece&s;&s;or of the under&s;igned, the di&s;|patches of the lieutenant governor, dated 10th October 1794&punc; by which he announces that he ordered the commandant of the militia of Norfolk to make the nece&s;&s;ary inquiries for enabling the
<PB N="31" REF="32">
executive of Virginia, to render to the Republic the ju&s;tice it had a right to expect. The re&s;ult of the&s;e inquiries is not known. However, the fact about which the mini&s;ter Fauchet complained to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate was notorious, and painful re&s;earches were not nece&s;&s;ary to convince him&s;elf of it. Do we not find in this proceeding a formal de&s;ire to elude the treaties, and to favour the Engli&s;h?</P>
<P>If the government of the United States had wi&s;hed to maintain it&s;elf in that impartiality which its duties pre&s;cribed, if it had wi&s;hed freely to ex|ecute the treaties, it would not have waited every time that the Engli&s;h infringed them, for the mi|ni&s;ter to &s;olicit its ju&s;tice: &s;hould it not have given in&s;tructions &s;o preci&s;e, that the governors of the &s;tates and &s;ubaltern officers of the federal govern|ment might know what duties they had to fulfil, in order to maintain the execution of treaties? Why have the mo&s;t energetic orders (&s;uch as the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, Randolph, mentions) been giv|en, when the &s;upport of the neutrality inviolate in favour of the Engli&s;h, came in que&s;tion? Why have the mea&s;ures taken by the federal govern|ment operated with &s;o much &s;lowne&s;s when France was intere&s;ted? Why in fine have the multiplied claims of her mini&s;ters never produced the redre&s;s of the grievances of which they complained?</P>
<P>When the predece&s;&s;or of the under&s;igned mini&s;|ter plenipotentiary claimed the execution of the 17th article of the treaty, interdicting the entry into the American ports of Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els which &s;hould have made prizes upon the French, when he cited this &s;imple and formal &s;tipulation: <Q>&startq;On the contrary, neither a&s;ylum nor refuge &s;hall be given in the ports or harbours of France or of
<PB N="32" REF="33">
the United States to ve&s;&s;els which &s;hall have made prizes of the French or Americans; and &s;hould they be obliged to enter by tempe&s;t, or danger of the &s;ea, all proper means &s;hall be &endq;u&s;ed to make them depart as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible;"</Q> the &s;ecretary of &s;tate in order to avoid &s;hutting the American ports again&s;t the Engli&s;h, interpreted this article in their favour. <Q>&startq;But it would be uncandid to conceal from you the con&s;truction which we have hitherto deemed the true one. The fir&s;t part of the 17th article relates to French &s;hips of war and privateers entering our ports with their prizes; the &s;econd contracts the &s;itu|ation of the enemies of France, by forbidding &s;uch as &s;hall have made prize of the French; intimating from this connexion of the two clau&s;|es, that the ve&s;&s;els forbidden are tho&s;e which bring their prizes with them. It has been con|&s;idered that this &s;ection of the treaty was im|partially de&s;tined to the with-holding of pro|tection, or &s;uccour, to the prizes them&s;elves; had it been otherwi&s;e, it would have been &s;u|perfluous, to have prohibited from &s;ailing what they have taken in the ports of the United &endq;States."</Q></P>
<P>He &s;aid, moreover, in his letter of the 29th of May, 1795&mdash;<Q>&startq;But on the 3d of Augu&s;t the pre|&s;ident declared his con&s;truction of that treaty to be, that no public armed ve&s;&s;els were thereby forbidden from our waters, except tho&s;e which &s;hould have made prize of the people or pro|perty &endq;of France coming with their prizes."</Q> But how is it po&s;&s;ible to find, in the &s;tipulations of the treaty, the &s;en&s;e given to them by the government of the United States? This expre&s;&s;ion of the treaty, "which &s;hall have made prizes," is gene|ral,
<PB N="33" REF="34">
and applies to all capturing ve&s;&s;els, whether they enter the ports of the United States with prizes, or enter them alone, after having made prizes. It is evident, that the government adds to the letter of the treaty in this circum&s;tance; and is it not a&s;toni&s;hing, that it admits a con&s;truc|tion of the treaty, when it expects to find a mean|ing di&s;advantageous to France, and in other in|&s;tances oppo&s;es all con&s;truction, when this would be favourable to the Republic. But has it the right of con&s;truing the treaty, of changing, of its own accord, the &s;en&s;e of a clear and preci&s;e &s;tipu|lation, without the con&s;ent and concurrence of the other contracting party? Doubtle&s;s not, e&s;pe|cially, when, by &s;o doing, it wounds her intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;ecretary of &s;tate, by the 22d article, pre|tends to &s;upport his con&s;truction of the 17th ar|ticle. What does this 22d article contain? A prohibition of the enemies of France and of the United States from arming in the re&s;pective ports of the two powers, of &s;elling their prizes, or of di&s;charging all or part of their cargo there. This article, therefore, applies to the prizes; whil&s;t the 17th applies to the capturing ve&s;&s;els. Did it not exi&s;t, the enemies of France or of the United States, might &s;end their prizes into the re&s;pective ports of the two powers, without con|ducting them there them&s;elves: the 17th article, containing only a prohibitory arrangement for the capturing ve&s;&s;els, could not prohibit them from doing this. It was nece&s;&s;ary then to have re|cour&s;e to a formal prohibition: be&s;ides, as the ve&s;&s;els which have made prizes on the French or Americans, are admitted into the ports of France or of the United States, in ca&s;es of tempe&s;t or dangers of the &s;ea, they might, in this ca&s;e,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
have conceived them&s;elves authori&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e of their prizes, to &s;ell them, or to di&s;charge their cargoes; it was nece&s;&s;ary therefore to take this right from them in a po&s;itive manner; it was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent them from benefitting by a &s;tipulation made in favour of humanity: this is the end an&s;wered by the 22d article, which is not &s;uperfluous, as the &s;ecretary of &s;tate maintains, but, on the contrary, contains a di&s;tinct &s;tipula|tion from that of the 17th. It is then evident from this, that in the ca&s;es above cited by the under&s;igned, the &s;tipulations of the 17th article have been violated. They have been equally &s;o, by the admi&s;&s;ion, in &s;undry ports, of the Thetis and Hu&s;&s;ar frigates, which captured la Prevoyante and la Rai&s;on, French &s;tore-&s;hips, and by admit|ting, in the la&s;t in&s;tance, this &s;ame &s;hip la Rai&s;on, prize to the Thetis, into the ports of the United States.</P>
<P>But admitting, for a moment, the con&s;truction gratuitou&s;ly given by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate to the 17th article of the treaty of 1778; this article has not the le&s;s been violated, when the Argo|naut, which had quitted Hampton roads in order to capture l'E&s;perance, was permitted to enter with that prize&punc; when the Terp&s;ichore was &s;uffer|ed to bring in the privateer la Montagne. In vain were &s;ought, in the re&s;ources of a captious and fal&s;e logic, the means of excu&s;ing &s;uch con|duct. The facts &s;peak, and every upright mind, not blinded by pa&s;&s;ion, will nece&s;&s;arily yield to their evidence. Yet the prohibitory &s;tipulation of the admi&s;&s;ion of prizes made by her enemies, is the only advantage which France expected to enjoy, after having wrought and guaranteed the independence of the United States, at a time
<PB N="35" REF="36">
when &s;he might, as the price of that very inde|pendence, have granted them le&s;s liberal condi|tions.</P>
<P>The&s;e wrongs of the American government to|wards the Republic, ju&s;t &s;tated by the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, will &s;oon be aggravated by new ones. It was a little matter only to al|low the Engli&s;h to avail them&s;elves of the ad|vantages of our treaty; it was nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;|&s;ure the&s;e to them by the aid of a contract, which might &s;erve at once as a reply to the claims of France, and as peremptory motives for refu&s;als, the true cau&s;e of which it was requi&s;ite ince&s;&s;ant|ly to di&s;gui&s;e to her under &s;pecious pretexts.</P>
<P>Such was the object of Mr. Jay's mi&s;&s;ion to London; &s;uch was the object of a negociation, enveloped from its origin in the &s;hadow of my&s;|tery, and covered with the vail of di&s;&s;imulation. Could the executive directory have any other idea of it, on examining its i&s;&s;ue, on &s;eeing all the ef|forts made by the American government to con|ceal the &s;ecret from every eye.</P>
<P>In his me&s;&s;age to the &s;enate of the 16th April, 1794, the pre&s;ident declared, that Mr. Jay was &s;ent to London only to obtain a redre&s;s of the wrongs done to the United States; at the &s;ame time the &s;ecretary of &s;tate communicated to the predece&s;&s;or of the under&s;igned, a part of the in|&s;tructions to Mr. Jay, reminding him of the <HI>in|tention of the American government not to deviate from its engagements with the Republic of France</HI>. The French mini&s;ter, deceived by this communi|cation, contributed ingenuou&s;ly to deceive his go|vernment. The American mini&s;ter in France removed the fears of the French government, as to the mi&s;&s;ion of this envoy extraordinary, and
<PB N="36" REF="37">
repre&s;ented it as the only means of obtaining in|demnification for the lo&s;&s;es which the American commerce had &s;u&s;tained. What has this negoci|ation produced? A treaty of amity and com|merce, which deprives France of all the advan|tages &s;tipulated in a previous treaty.</P>
<P>In fact, all that could render the neutrality profitable to England and injurious to France is combined in this treaty. Her commercial rela|tions with the United States are entirely broken, by the abandonment of the modern public law on contraband, a law which England had con&s;e|crated in eleven treaties, and which the Ameri|cans had al&s;o con&s;ecrated in their treaties with France, Holland, Sweden and Pru&s;&s;ia. From the new arrangements adopted by the United States with regard to England, the free carriage of the articles for the equipment and armament of ve&s;|&s;els, is granted exclu&s;ively to that power.</P>
<P>By the 23d article of the treaty of Ver&s;ailles, the United States have the liberty of freely car|rying on commerce with the enemies of France. The 24th article of the treaty with Holland, the 10th article of the treaty with Sweden, and the 13th article of the treaty with Pru&s;&s;ia, contain the &s;ame &s;tipulation. This la&s;t article gives even more exten&s;ive rights to the United States, by permitting them to carry to the enemies of this power, all the articles that are enumerated in the li&s;t of &s;uch as are contraband of war, without their being liable to confi&s;cation. But by the 18th article of the treaty of London, the articles for arming and equipping ve&s;&s;els are declared con|traband of war. The government of the United States has therefore, by this &s;tipulation, granted to the Engli&s;h a right which they had refu&s;ed, in
<PB N="37" REF="38">
con&s;equence of the modern public law, to other nations with whom they have made treaties; that of &s;eizing on board their ve&s;&s;els, articles proper for the con&s;truction and equipment of ve&s;&s;els. The Engli&s;h, then, according to that, enjoy the exclu&s;ive commerce of articles proper for the con|&s;truction of ve&s;&s;els; yet prior to the treaty con|cluded between John Jay and Lord Grenville, the United States had the right of carrying on commerce with every power: the partiality of the American government in favour of England, has therefore been &s;uch, that not only the inter|e&s;ts of France, but al&s;o tho&s;e of other &s;tates, have been &s;acrificed to her.</P>
<P>In vain will it be objected that France, having the right by her treaty of 1778, to enjoy all the advantages in commerce and navigation, which the United States have granted to England, is not injured by the &s;tipulations of the treaty of 1794, relative to contraband of war, as they become common to her. But the right &s;ecured to her by the &s;econd article of the treaty of 1778, does not at all extend to the allies whom the &s;uc|ce&s;s of her arms, and the ju&s;t re&s;entment, in&s;pir|ed by the ambition of England, have definitively given and &s;hall give to her in Europe. The&s;e di&s;po&s;itions change, during the cour&s;e of the war, the &s;ituation of the United States, towards En|gland and the belligerent powers allied to France; the intere&s;t of the&s;e powers is common to France; and from the moment that is injured, France is injured al&s;o.</P>
<P>After having a&s;&s;ured to the Engli&s;h the carriage of naval &s;tores, the federal government wi&s;hed to a&s;&s;ure to them that of meals; in a word, it de&s;ired to have commerce only with England.
<PB N="38" REF="39">
Thus, it &s;tipulates, by the 18th article, that the American ve&s;&s;els, laden with grain, may be &s;eiz|ed under the frivolous pretext, that it is extremely difficult to define the ca&s;es wherein provi&s;ions, and other articles which are generally excepted, could be cla&s;&s;ed in the li&s;t of contraband of war: thus it &s;tipulates in article 17, that the Ameri|can ve&s;&s;els may be arre&s;ted upon the &s;ingle &s;u&s;|picion, either that they have merchandi&s;e belong|ing to the enemy, or that they carry to him arti|cles contraband of war. The United States, in their treaty with France, have made &s;tipulations entirely oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e ju&s;t cited; whil&s;t her ve&s;&s;els of war are bound to re&s;pect the American flag going to Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the Engli&s;h drag into their ports American ve&s;&s;els going to the ports of France; &s;ubject them to deci&s;ions more or le&s;s arbitrary; and often condemn them on ac|count of the name, alone, of their owners. By which means all the commercial relations between the United States and France, are entirely &s;u&s;|pended. What American will venture to &s;end ve&s;&s;els into French ports? What commerce will he venture to undertake with the French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons, when it will be certain that his funds, either in going to, or returning from them, run the greate&s;t hazard? Would he not rather prefer traf|ficking with a country, to which his ve&s;&s;els might go without being expo&s;ed to other ri&s;ks than tho&s;e of the &s;ea? Would he not prefer Great Britain to France, for his &s;peculations? In virtue of the treaty of London, and by the cour&s;e of things, would not the commerce of the United States pa&s;s entirely to England, during the pre&s;ent war?</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">After having con&s;ented to &s;uch conditions, the American government cannot pretend to impar|tiality; it cannot &s;ay that it has maintained an equal neutrality between France and England, &s;ince it has granted to Great Britain advantages denied to France. But every one of the&s;e ad|vantages granted to England, was a real wrong to the Republic; and if it is not maintained, without &s;porting with all principles, that a govern|ment may con&s;ider it&s;elf as neutral, in granting to a belligerent power, advantages which it refu&s;es to another, it is clear that the government of the United States, after having made its treaty with Great Britain, cea&s;ed to be neutral, when it op|po&s;ed it&s;elf to the participation by France, in the favours granted to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence, the under&s;igned mini&s;ter ple|nipotentiary again declares, that the executive directory has ju&s;t ordered the ve&s;&s;els of war and privateers of the Republic, to treat American ve&s;&s;els in the &s;ame manner, as they &s;uffer the Engli&s;h to treat them.</P>
<P>Were the treaty of London out of the que&s;tion, the mea&s;ure the executive directory now takes, would not be le&s;s conformable to ju&s;tice. The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary has develop|ed to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in his note of the 6th Brumaire la&s;t, principles which leave no doubt in this re&s;pect, and which the an&s;wer of the &s;e|cretary of &s;tate is far from de&s;troying. (No. 5.) But the &s;tipulations of treaties now come to the &s;upport of general principles. The Republic calls for the execution of the &s;econd article of the treaty of 1778, which &s;ays, that France and the United States, mutually engage not to grant any particular favour, as to navigation or com|merce,
<PB N="40" REF="41">
which &s;hall not immediately become com|mon to the other party. The government of the United States having by the treaty of London, &s;a|crificed to England the freedom of their flag, the property of the enemies of England, and naval &s;tores; France, by her treaty, is authori&s;ed to claim the &s;ame advantage, to make u&s;e of it, and the United States have no right to complain.</P>
<P>Certainly it would have been more conforma|ble to the de&s;igns of France, to her principles, to &s;ee the American flag, floating without inter|ruption upon the &s;eas, to &s;ee the commerce of the United States enjoy that liberty, that freedom, which &s;hould belong to neutral nations: but, in order to that, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the American government &s;hould know how to maintain that neutrality; it was nece&s;&s;ary that it pre&s;erved it free from violation by Great Britain; and if now the execution of the mea&s;ures which the directory is obliged to adopt, give ri&s;e to complaints in the United States, it is not again&s;t France they &s;hould be directed, but again&s;t tho&s;e men who by nego|ciations contrary to the intere&s;ts of their country, have brought the French government to u&s;e the prerogatives granted to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>When, after having &s;uffered to be violated the treaties which unite it to France, the government of the United States has a&s;&s;ociated it&s;elf with England, and has rendered its neutrality as u&s;eful to that power as it is now injurious to its ancient ally; could the Republic be &s;ilent? Her outraged genero&s;ity, her wounded honour, prevented her; her &s;ilence were weakne&s;s; and, &s;trong in her principles as in her proceedings, &s;he &s;hould de|mand her unacknowledged or forgotten rights.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">Thus therefore, as it re&s;ults from the &s;tatement which the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary has ju&s;t given,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, has been violated; that in contempt of this article the American tribunals have been permitted to take cogni&s;ance of the validity of prizes made by French &s;hips of war and privateers, under pretext of original armament or augmentation of arma|ment in the United States, or of capture within the juri&s;dictional line of the United States.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the &s;aid article 17 has been equally vi|olated by the admi&s;&s;ion of Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els into the ports of the United States, which had made prizes on Frenchmen, and by the admi&s;&s;ion of their prizes.</P>
<P>The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, in the name, and by the orders of the executive di|rectory, prote&s;ts again&s;t the violation of the 17th article above cited, in contempt of which the A|merican tribunals have taken cogni&s;ance of the validity of prizes made by French &s;hips of war, or privateers, under pretext of original armament, or augmentation of armament in the United States, or of capture within the juri&s;dictional line; claims the replevy of all &s;eizures, and the repeal of all other judicial acts exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e prizes; and prote&s;ts, moreover, again&s;t all oppo&s;ition to the &s;ale of the &s;aid prizes.</P>
<P>Further, the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotenti|ary prote&s;ts again&s;t the violation of the 17th arti|cle of the treaty of 1778, in contempt of which Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els, which had made prize on French|men, have been admitted into the ports of the United States; and declares, that the executive directory cannot regard as a ju&s;t con&s;truction of
<PB N="42" REF="43">
the treaty, the di&s;tinction which Mr. Randolph, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, has e&s;tabli&s;hed in his letter of 29th May, 1795, in which he admits only the exclu&s;ion of the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els which bring in their prizes, and wi&s;hes to except from the prohi|bitory mea&s;ure, the ve&s;&s;els which, after having made prizes, enter the ports of the United States.</P>
<P>The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary more|over declares, that the executive directory regards the treaty of commerce concluded with Great Britain as a violation of the treaty made with France in 1778, and equivalent to a treaty of alli|ance with Great Britain, and that ju&s;tly offended at the conduct which the American government has held in this ca&s;e, they have given him orders to &s;u&s;pend from this moment his mini&s;terial func|tions with the federal government.</P>
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;e which for a long time prevent|ed the executive directory from allowing their ju&s;t re&s;entment to break forth, has al&s;o tempered its effects. Neither hatred, nor the de&s;ire of ven|geance, rapidly &s;ucceed to friend&s;hip in the heart of a Frenchman; the name of America &s;till ex|cites &s;weet emotions in it, notwith&s;tanding the wrongs of its government; and the executive directory wi&s;h not to break with a people whom they love to &s;alute with the appellation of friend.</P>
<P>The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary there|fore announces that the government of the United States, and the American people, are not to regard the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of his functions as a rupture be|tween France and the United States, but as a mark of ju&s;t di&s;content, which is to la&s;t until the go|vernment of the United States returns to &s;entiments and to mea&s;ures more conformable to the intere&s;ts
<PB N="43" REF="44">
of the alliance and the &s;worn friend&s;hip between the two nations.</P>
<P>This alliance was always dear to Frenchmen; they have done every thing to tighten its bands; the government of the United States, on the con|trary, has &s;ought to break them. Scarcely had the war broken out between France and England, when America was alone invited to the commerce of the Antilles. All the colonial ports were open|ed to her. Her ve&s;&s;els entered the ports of France without being &s;ubjected to higher duties than French ve&s;&s;els. When the Engli&s;h violated the freedom of the neutral flag, the convention was obliged to u&s;e repri&s;als. They ordered, that neu|tral ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be &s;eized by the &s;hips of the Republic; &s;he excepted the Americans from this mea&s;ure: forced again&s;t her inclination to make it bear on them al&s;o, &s;he waited with impatience for the moment when &s;he might return to a con|duct more conformable to her &s;entiments for the United States. Soon &s;he revoked her law relative to the arre&s;t of their ve&s;&s;els. Soon al&s;o the com|mittee of public &s;afety gave orders to re&s;pect the American flag. In every circum&s;tance France &s;ought the means of proving to the United States, the &s;incerity of her friend&s;hip. When the federal government complained of the conduct of one of the predece&s;&s;ors of the under&s;igned, the French government &s;aw only the complaints of the go|vernment of the United States, and immediately gave the mo&s;t &s;triking reparation.</P>
<P>Let the annals of the French revolution be opened; let the minutes of that augu&s;t &s;itting be &s;een, in which the national convention received the mini&s;ter of the United States in its bo&s;om; the addre&s;&s;es were not &s;tudied; they &s;prang from
<PB N="44" REF="45">
hearts full of affection for an allied people; they breathed the &s;entiments which dictated them; and the American mini&s;ter found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of his friends. What joy did not the Ame|rican flag in&s;pire, when it waved unfurled in the French &s;enate? Tender tears trickled from each eye; every one looked at it with amazement. There, &s;aid they, is the &s;ymbol of the indepen|dence of our American brethren&mdash;behold there the pledge of their liberty! May victory always attend it&mdash;may it lead to glory none but a free and happy people! The&s;e words which e&s;caped from a thou&s;and mouths were the expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;enti|ments of the whole nation. Was not an American to each Frenchman, another Frenchman?&mdash;He was more&mdash;he was a friend; and that &s;acred name, amid&s;t civil di&s;&s;entions, was equally re&s;pected by all.</P>
<P>What then was done by the government? It put in que&s;tion, whether it &s;hould execute the treaties, or receive the agents of the rebel and pro&s;cribed princes. (No. 6.) It made a procla|mation of in&s;idious neutrality: by its chicaneries it abandoned French privateers to its courts of ju&s;tice; it eluded the amicable mediation of the Republic for breaking the chains of its citizens at Algiers. (No. 7.) Notwith&s;tanding treaty &s;ti|pulations, it allowed to be arre&s;ted ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tate; it &s;uffered England, by in&s;ulting its neu|trality, to interrupt its commerce with France; notwith&s;tanding the faith of treaties, it gave an a&s;ylum to the&s;e &s;ame Engli&s;h, who, after having in&s;ulted her flag, pillaged her citizens, came al&s;o to brave the American people in its ports, and to take a &s;tation whence to cruize on a favourable opportunity again&s;t the French: it might be &s;aid, that it applauded their audacity; all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="45" REF="46">
their will, it allowed the French colonies to be declared in a &s;tate of blockade, and its citizens interdicted the right of trading to them. (No. 8.) It eluded all the advances made by the Republic for renewing the treaties of commerce upon a more favourable footing to both nations. (No. 9.) It excu&s;ed it&s;elf on the mo&s;t frivolous pretexts; whil&s;t it anticipated Great Britain, by &s;oliciting a treaty, in which, pro&s;tituting its neutrality, it &s;a|crificed France to her enemies, or rather, looking upon her as obliterated from the chart of the world, it forgot the &s;ervices that &s;he had rendered it, and throw a&s;ide the duty of gratitude, as if ingratitude was a governmental duty.</P>
<P>Alas! time has not yet demoli&s;hed the fortifi|cations with which the Engli&s;h roughened this country&mdash;nor tho&s;e the Americans rai&s;ed for their defence; their half rounded &s;ummits &s;till appear in every quarter, amid&s;t plains, on the tops of mountains.

&mdash;As &s;oon as the war in Europe had embraced tho&s;e powers with whom the United States have the mo&s;t exten&s;ive relations, there was rea&s;on to apprehend that an exten&s;ive intercour&s;e with them might be interrupted, and our di&s;po&s;ition for peace drawn into que&s;tion by the &s;u&s;picions too often entertained by belligerent nations. It &s;eemed therefore to be my duty, to admoni&s;h our citizens of the con&s;equences of a contraband trade, and of ho&s;tile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain, by a declaration of the exi&s;ting legal &s;tate of things, an ea&s;ier admi&s;&s;ion of our right to the immunities belonging to our &s;ituation. Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions the proclamation, which will be laid before you, was i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>In this po&s;ture of affairs, both new and deli|cate, I re&s;olved to adopt general rules, which &s;hould conform to the treaties, and a&s;&s;ert the pri|vileges of the United States. The&s;e were re|duced into a &s;y&s;tem, which will be communicated to you. Although I have not thought my&s;elf at liberty to forbid the &s;ale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France, to be brought into our ports, I have not refu&s;ed to cau&s;e them to be re&s;tored when they were taken within the protection of our territory, or by ve&s;|&s;els commi&s;&s;ioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the United States.</P>
<P>It re&s;ts with the wi&s;dom of congre&s;s to correct, improve, or enforce this plan of protection; and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code, and the juri&s;diction of the courts of the United States, to many ca&s;es, which, though dependent on principles already recogni&s;|ed, demand &s;ome further provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49">Where individuals &s;hall, within the United States, array them&s;elves in ho&s;tility again&s;t any of the powers at war, or enter upon military ex|peditions or enterpri&s;es within the juri&s;diction of the United States, or u&s;urp and exerci&s;e judicial authority within the United States, or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indi&s;tinctly marked, or are inadequate, the&s;e offences cannot receive too early and clo&s;e an attention, and require prompt and deci&s;ive remedies.</P>
<P>Whatever tho&s;e remedies may be, they will be well admini&s;tered by the judiciary, who po&s;&s;e&s;s a long e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e of inve&s;tigation, effectual proce&s;s, and officers in the habit of executing it.</P>
<P>(No. 3.) The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipoten|tiary having complained to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, that the attorney of the United States had cau&s;ed the privateer <HI>La Vengeance</HI> to be arre&s;ted without an affidavit or other authentic te&s;timony; on the 11th Augu&s;t, 1795, the &s;ecretary of &s;tate &s;ent him an an&s;wer, which Mr. Troup had addre&s;&s;ed to him in the ab&s;ence of Mr. Harri&s;on, di&s;trict at|torney of New York, in which is this pa&s;&s;age&mdash; <Q>&startq;As to the &s;uit again&s;t the privateer, it was com|menced by Mr. Harri&s;on, as attorney for the di&s;trict, upon an official di&s;clo&s;ure to him, by the Spani&s;h con&s;ul, of the evidence which led him to &s;uppo&s;e the privateer had been fitted out and armed within the United States. Mr. Harri&s;on, upon receiving this di&s;clo&s;ure, felt him&s;elf called upon by con&s;iderations, which, as a public officer, he could not re&s;i&s;t, to pro|ceed again&s;t the privateer under the 3d &s;ection of the act of congre&s;s, entitled, An act in ad|dition to the act for the puni&s;hment of certain
<PB N="49" REF="50">
crimes again&s;t the United States, pa&s;&s;ed 5th June, 1794. This &s;ection works a forfeiture of the privateer, one half to the u&s;e of any per&s;on who &s;hall give information of the of|fence, and the other half to the u&s;e of the United States. No per&s;on having appeared in quality of informer to in&s;titute the &s;uit, Mr. Harri&s;on, according to the cour&s;e of the com|mon law, filed an information in behalf of the United States, &s;olely again&s;t the privateer, as you will perceive by the copy of the informa|tion already tran&s;mitted to you. No law of the United States, and no law or u&s;age of this &s;tate, required the information to be founded upon any previous affidavit, or evidence of the truth of the matters alleged in it. The fil|ing of an information is an act entirely in the di&s;cretion of the officer entru&s;ted by law with the power of doing it; and if he &s;hould abu&s;e his power, he &s;tands upon the footing of all public officers who are guilty of malver&s;ation in office. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, Mr. Harri|&s;on has acted from the be&s;t of his judgment upon the duty of his office, after officially ob|taining information from a public officer, who conceived him&s;elf likewi&s;e bound by a &s;en&s;e &endq;of duty to communicate the information."</Q></P>
<P>When the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary renewed the charge on the 3d Vendemaire, 4th year (24th September, 1795) to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and &s;till complained that an affidavit was not required to cau&s;e a privateer to be arre&s;ted&mdash;he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;But I again renew the a&s;&s;ertion that an affi|davit is not nece&s;&s;ary for ordering the arre&s;t of &endq;a ve&s;&s;el:</Q></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">What is the law, what is the u&s;age, which e&s;|tabli&s;hes the pro&s;ecution for reparation of an offence, before it be a&s;certained that it has been committed; and what certainty then had the at|torney? His opinion! Upon what is it founded? The complaint of the Spani&s;h agent, &s;ince there was not a &s;ingle affidavit.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, upon mere &s;u&s;picions which the ene|my intere&s;t will not fail always to bring forward, the French privateers are to be &s;ubjected to &s;eiz|ure! Such a mea&s;ure tends to nothing le&s;s than to paralyze the 17th article of our treaty.</P>
<P>The &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in reply, &s;ent to the un|der&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary the copy of a letter from Mr. Harri&s;on, of the 3d Oct. 1795, in which is this remarkable pa&s;&s;age&mdash;<Q>&startq;In this whole bu&s;ine&s;s, however, I have undoubtedly acted from my own opinion, founded upon &s;uch evidence as came to my knowledge; and as in &s;imilar ca&s;es, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, be unacquainted with the opinions and convic|tions of others, I know of no other rule by which I can be guided, <HI>unle&s;s when I am ho|noured with the directions of the chief executive &endq;magi&s;trate."</HI></Q></P>
<P>The &s;ecretary of &s;tate thus clo&s;es his letter of the 16th of October covering that of Mr. Harri|&s;on&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>&startq;You will perceive that whatever may be the event of the &s;uits pending in court concerning her [<HI>the privateer</HI>] and her prize, the public officer, Mr. Harri&s;on, is &s;upported in his pro|ceedings by the laws and u&s;ages of this coun|try, upon &s;uch evidence and information as in &endq;the ca&s;e referred to were produced."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">(No. 4.) In virtue of this law, the tribunals were only authori&s;ed to decide on ca&s;es in which the neutrality of the United States &s;hall have been compromitted. Yet the&s;e tribunals conceived they had a right to pronounce upon prizes made by the French, in almo&s;t an indefinite manner. In the affair of Gla&s;s and Gibbs again&s;t the &s;hip Bet&s;ey, the deci&s;ion of which has been printed, the &s;upreme court pronounced, that the tribunals could decide whether a prize belonged to enemies or to neutrals. In the affair of Joo&s;t Jan&s;on again&s;t the Dutch &s;hip Vrouw Catharina Magdalena, it was decided that the naturalization granted in the territories of France to American citizens, during the war, could not give them the right either of &s;erving or of commanding on board of French privateers; that the prizes made by &s;uch, although legally commi&s;&s;ioned, were not valid: a di&s;tinc|tion is e&s;tabli&s;hed between a legal and an illegal privateer; it was judged that they had a right to pronounce on this legality; and con&s;equently on the validity of the prizes: it was finally decided, that a prize made at &s;ea with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an illegal privateer, was void and &s;hould be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>It was according to the&s;e fir&s;t deci&s;ions of the &s;upreme court that the di&s;trict attorney of Virgi|nia wrote officially, on the 28th March 1794, to the vice con&s;ul at Norfolk&mdash;<Q>&startq;No ve&s;&s;el can be condemned as prize, but in di&s;trict courts, which are the proper admiralties of the United &endq;States."</Q> The enemies of France under&s;tood, or did not under&s;tand, this mode; but they avail|ed them&s;elves of it; and in order to cau&s;e French privateers to be arre&s;ted, they had recour&s;e to the law of 5th June 1794.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">At this period however, the law had put into the hands of government a &s;ufficient power for preventing the arming and equipping of priva|teers in the ports of the United States. By the letter of the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury of the 4th Augu&s;t 1793, the collectors of the cu&s;toms were authori&s;ed, and even required, to vi&s;it, in the &s;tricte&s;t manner, not only all privateers, but all ve&s;&s;els entering or going out of American ports. The law of 5th June authori&s;ed the pre&s;ident to &s;upport the exerci&s;e of the&s;e functions with military force. Of cour&s;e, they did not neglect to vi&s;it, with the greate&s;t rigor, all French ve&s;&s;els, privateers and others, during their continuance in the ports of the United States, and at their de|parture. They did not quit the&s;e ports, but un|der the eye, and with the expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion, of the officers of the government; for it had forbid|den the collectors to clear them, if they commit|ted the lea&s;t violation on the neutrality of the United States: in which ca&s;e they might be &s;eiz|ed and confi&s;cated. Yet, whether they had en|tered the ports of the United States armed, and al&s;o went out armed; or had &s;ince been armed for war in French ports, &s;carcely did one of their prizes enter, but &s;he was arre&s;ted by order of the federal court.</P>
<P>The proceedings were in&s;tituted and pur&s;ued, without any of the forms for protecting citizens. As the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary has &s;aid, the a&s;&s;ertion of an enemy of the Republic was &s;ufficient for cau&s;ing a prize to be &s;eized, oft|en the privateer which had brought her in; and &s;ometimes, for the arre&s;t of her captain, no proof was required from the enemy con&s;ul who in&s;tigat|ed the arre&s;t; he was not obliged to give &s;ecurity
<PB N="53" REF="54">
For the damages which might re&s;ult from the pro|cedure, if it we're unfounded; the captain was not allowed to remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his property, on giving &s;ecurity for its value; the prizes were not valued; they &s;imply placed them in the hands of the officers of ju&s;tice; rarely were they permitted to be &s;old; and then the &s;ale was made with &s;low|ne&s;s, and not till the con&s;ent of the two parties was obtained. In fine, when with much delay and expen&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the &s;hifts of a crafty chicanery, the complainants proved nothing they advanced, the prizes were adjudged to the cap|tors, but refu&s;ed indemnification for damages and lo&s;&s;es occa&s;ioned by this &s;eizure.</P>
<P>The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary knows but two affairs, that of <HI>La No&s;tra Senora del Car|men</HI>, at Rhode I&s;land, and that of <HI>La Prince&s;&s;e des A&s;turies</HI>, at New York, where &s;ecurity was given to the party complaining, and where da|mages and intere&s;ts were allowed to the captors&mdash; yet the tribunals have always allowed damages to the captured, when they have declared the prizes illegal. The lea&s;t pretext was &s;ufficient to obtain from a tribunal the arre&s;t of a prize; it was &s;uffi|cient to allege, that the privateer had taken one or two cannon, one or two barrels of powder, or opened &s;ome port-holes in the territory of the United States.</P>
<P>In the affair of the two prizes of the French privateer Les Citoyens de Mar&s;eille, which enter|ed the port of Philadelphia, armed and commi&s;|&s;ioned, repaired in the &s;ame port, and &s;ent out under the eyes of the government, the only thing in que&s;tion was, that &s;ome port-holes were pre|tended to have been opened in the ve&s;&s;el after her departure from Philadelphia; the court of Charle&s;|ton
<PB N="54" REF="55">
was of opinion, that the holes had been open|ed, and condemned the two prizes. The &s;uperior courts did not adopt this opinion, and the fir&s;t &s;entence was rever&s;ed; but after how long a time, how much care, fatigue, pain and expen&s;e?</P>
<P>In the affair of the Prince&s;&s;e des A&s;turies, at New York, as will be &s;een hereafter, only two cannon and a &s;core of fu&s;ees were in que&s;tion; behold what is called an armament, behold how words are abu&s;ed!</P>
<P>Prizes have been arre&s;ted under &s;till more fri|volous pretexts. The privateer La Pari&s;ienne had infringed a revenue law of the United States; &s;he was &s;eized and condemned by the di&s;trict court. This tribunal, doubtle&s;s agreeably to rules pre&s;cribed by the law, had re&s;tored this ve&s;&s;el to her owners, on making them pay her value. The privateer, after having executed the &s;entence of the court, went out and made two con&s;iderable prizes: one was &s;ent into Charle&s;ton and the other into Savannah. They were both arre&s;ted at the in&s;tance of the Engli&s;h con&s;uls, under the pretext that the tribunal had acted illegally, by re&s;toring the confi&s;cated privateer&mdash;that notwith|&s;tanding this re&s;titution and the payment of her value to the trea&s;urer, &s;he had always remained the property of the United States, and could not make any lawful prize. This ridiculous a&s;&s;ertion was &s;eriou&s;ly oppo&s;ed in the di&s;trict and circuit courts, and in the &s;upreme court of the United States; at the clo&s;e of the proceedings, which la&s;ted nearly two years, the prizes were adjudged to the captors, but without allowing them da|mages.</P>
<P>In like manner have been treated the rich and numerous prizes of the French privateers La
<PB N="55" REF="56">
Mere Michelle, Le Brutus, Le General Laveaux, and Le Vengeur. The captors have gained their cau&s;es in three courts, and have not obtained da|mages.</P>
<P>Were it nece&s;&s;ary to cite here all the vexatious proceedings commenced again&s;t French ve&s;&s;els, the under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary would be obliged to write a volume. He contents him|&s;elf with adding to what he has ju&s;t &s;aid, the af|fair of the Vengeance and that of the Ca&s;&s;ius.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Affair of the Vengeance.</HEAD>
<P>At the beginning of 1794, the predece&s;&s;or of the under&s;igned charged the captain of La Do|rade, a French galliot, with a particular mi&s;&s;ion for St. Domingo. He ordered him to go to New York with his galliot, to take &s;ome powder which was at Sandy Hook on board the frigate La Se|millante, belonging to the Republic, and which made part of her equipment, and to carry them to General Laveaux. This ve&s;&s;el had formerly been armed for war; &s;he had been built with port-holes; con&s;equently &s;he attracted the parti|cular attention of the government. Many diffi|culties were thrown in her way; but finally, after having &s;ubmitted to all the requi&s;ite in&s;pections, &s;he &s;ailed with a formal clearance from the col|lector of the cu&s;toms of Philadelphia. She went to New York, where the captain acquitted him|&s;elf of his mi&s;&s;ion, and thence to Port de Paix, where the powder was delivered to General La|veaux. At that place this galliot was &s;old to an inhabitant of St. Domingo, who armed her, equip|ped her completely, partly at Port de Paix and partly at Cape Fran&ccedil;ois. She was called <HI>La
<PB N="56" REF="57">
Vengeance</HI>, and given to Captain Berard, as com|mander, who &s;ailed from St. Domingo with a com|mi&s;&s;ion in good form, and a crew entirely French, to crui&s;e again&s;t the enemies of the Republic. A few days after her departure, &s;he captured a Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;el, called the <HI>Prince&s;&s;e des A&s;turies</HI>, laden with a rich cargo, and carried her into the port of New York, in the &s;ummer of 1795.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h con&s;ul availing him&s;elf of the fa|cility given him by the law of 5th June 1794, had the prize arre&s;ted, under the pretext that the pri|vateer had been armed in the United States, and we &s;aw officers of the government appear to de|fend his a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;Mr. Harri&s;on, attorney of the di&s;trict of New York, and Mr. Troup, clerk of the di&s;trict and circuit courts, to which appertain|ed the deci&s;ion of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It was under the&s;e au&s;pices that the prize was arre&s;ted, and that the captain of the privateer &s;aw him&s;elf obliged to defend her again&s;t the al|legation of a pretended armament. But it was not &s;ufficient to have arre&s;ted the prize, they mu&s;t al&s;o attack the privateer: this did not fail to hap|pen. Shortly after Mr. Harri&s;on, without laying a&s;ide his office of attorney for the captured, but acting in this in&s;tance in the name of the United States, informed again&s;t <HI>La Vengeance</HI>, and re|quired her arre&s;t, under the &s;ame pretext which had been u&s;ed for arre&s;ting her prize. This in|formation was not founded upon any affidavit or material proof: but Mr. Attorney, according to his letter to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, had no need of any; he had &s;een in the hands of the Spani&s;h con&s;$l, documents &s;ufficient to have the prize condemned. In fine, not content with the&s;e mea|&s;ures, the &s;ame attorney, &s;ome time after, the two
<PB N="57" REF="58">
other cau&s;es being &s;till pending, exhibited a &s;econd information again&s;t the privateer, and had her ar|re&s;ted anew, for having exported arms in viola|tion of a law of the United States, which was in force when the Vengeance &s;ailed from New York. This information was made upon the &s;imple de|claration of Mr. Giles, mar&s;hal of the court, who, as informer, was to have his part of the confi&s;|cation: &s;o that all the officers of the di&s;trict court (except the judge) were intere&s;ted in the condem|nation of the privateer or her prize. It is well to ob&s;erve that, during the cour&s;e of the proce&s;s, the monies ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of the prize were depo&s;ited in the hands of the clerk (attor|ney for the Spaniards) tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of the privateer in the hands of the <HI>mar&s;hal</HI>, (in|former and intere&s;ted in the confi&s;cation)&mdash;&s;o that their intere&s;t was to &s;pin out the&s;e cau&s;es by means of appeal; and &s;o it has happened.</P>
<P>As this la&s;t information is here principally in que&s;tion, it is proper to enter into &s;ome details on the &s;ubject. It appeared in the allegation, that the privateer had exported from the United States two cannon, twenty mu&s;kets, and fifty barrels of powder.</P>
<P>Two cannon and twenty mu&s;kets could &s;carcely be an object of commercial &s;peculation. The exi&s;tence of the cannon has never been proved, and certainly whatever mu&s;kets were found on board, were only for the defence of the ve&s;&s;el, without a wi&s;h to infringe the laws of the Ameri|can government. The powder, in truth, was of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, but the con&s;ul of New York ha&s;tened to give his declaration under oath, and to prove by witne&s;&s;es, that this pow|der had been taken from on board La Semil|lante,
<PB N="58" REF="59">
and made part of her equipment. Mr. Harri&s;on did not yield to this evidence.</P>
<P>However, the three cau&s;es went on; but the yellow fever, which took place at New York, &s;pun them out to con&s;iderable length. The judg|ment of the di&s;trict court was not given till No|vember. In the mean time, an expre&s;s, which Capt. Berard had &s;ent to St. Domingo, on the fir&s;t arre&s;t of his prize, had returned with papers proving, in the mo&s;t convincing manner, that the Vengeur had arrived at Port-de-Paix without any armament or equipment whatever; and that &s;he had been &s;old, armed and equipped wholly, and commi&s;&s;ioned as a privateer, on the territory of the Republic. The&s;e documents were cer|tificates of the general, the ordonnateur, &amp;c. of the greater part of the principal officers of St. Domingo; the accounts of armament atte&s;ted by all the providers, [fourni&s;&s;eurs] &amp;c. the whole executed in the mo&s;t authentic form.</P>
<P>The under&s;igned ha&s;tened to communicate the&s;e documents to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate of the United States, and to reque&s;t that he would order the attorney of New York di&s;trict, to &s;tay the proceedings he had in&s;tituted in the name of the government. There was nothing done with them, and Mr. Harri&s;on continued his pro&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>In fine, the moment came for deciding the&s;e three cau&s;es. They were pleaded with much preparation before the di&s;trict court of New York: the privateer was acquitted of the charge of illegally arming, and the prize adjudged to the captor. Mr. Harri&s;on did not appeal as to the privateer, but the cau&s;e of the prize was car|ried to the circuit court, and finally to the &s;u|preme
<PB N="59" REF="60">
court; and the&s;e two tribunals confirmed the &s;entence of the di&s;trict court.</P>
<P>As to the exportation, the judge was of opi|nion that the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be condemned for it; and grounded his &s;entence only on the arti|cle of <HI>twenty mu&s;kets</HI>. Some of the attorneys for the privateer had con&s;idered it as of &s;o little con&s;equence, that they had not conceiv|ed it would be brought in que&s;tion; and had omitted to &s;peak of it in their pleadings. It was natural to appeal from &s;uch a &s;entence; the con|&s;ul of New York was the appellant, and requir|ed, agreeably to a law of congre&s;s, that the ve&s;|&s;el &s;hould be given up to him, under &s;ecurity dur|ing the appeal; but he could not obtain it; the ve&s;&s;el was &s;old for le&s;s than a tenth part of the co&s;t of her armament: and the money was de|po&s;ited till the conclu&s;ion of the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>The circuit court, as was expected, &s;et a&s;ide the &s;entence which condemned the privateer; but Mr. Harri&s;on, not content with all he had hitherto done, immediately appealed to the &s;u|preme court of the United States, which was not more favourable to him, and confirmed the &s;en|tence of the circuit court. The government, notwith&s;tanding the repre&s;entations of the under|&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, took a decided part in the appeal, and gave it in charge to Mr. Lee, the attorney general, to argue&mdash;which he did with much eloquence, but with the &s;ucce&s;s &s;uch a cau&s;e merited.</P>

<HEAD>Affair of the Ca&s;&s;ius.</HEAD>
<P>In the month of Thermidor, of the 3d year, (Augu&s;t, 1795) the corvette Le Ca&s;&s;ius, belong|ing to the Republic, commanded by Captain

<P>The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary com|plained of this violation of the treaties and of the law of nations, and reque&s;ted the govern|ment to cau&s;e, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, the relea&s;e of the corvette Le Ca&s;&s;ius and her captain. He con|ceived him&s;elf &s;o much the more grounded in this reque&s;t, as he knew that a like interpo&s;ition was not new in the annals of the United States; as he knew that the executive power of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania had interpo&s;ed in a &s;imilar ca&s;e, and in the &s;ame manner, in favour of the &s;tate of Vir|ginia, and as this mea&s;ure, dictated by a profound knowledge of the law of nations, and of the re|ciprocal duties of nations, had been approved and ratified by the tribunals, organs of the law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Simon Nathan ver&s;us the commonwealth of Virginia.

<P>The under&s;igned in&s;i&s;ting, on the fir&s;t Fructidor, in the third year (18th Augu&s;t, 1785) expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e terms: <Q>&startq;I do not know, nor ought I to know, other than the government

If the&s;e tribunals are the fir&s;t to violate them, I can only addre&s;s my&s;elf to the government for reparation of that violation; otherwi&s;e it would be, to render the agents of the French government&mdash;the French government it&s;elf, amenable to the&s;e tribunals; which would be &endq;to rever&s;e principles."</Q> Informed that the Ca&s;|&s;ius and her captain might be liberated on giving &s;ecurity, the under&s;igned reque&s;ted, by the &s;ame letter, that the government of the United States would, it&s;elf, furni&s;h this &s;ecurity; and know|ing that the &s;upreme court of the United States, which was then in &s;e&s;&s;ion, had the power, in cer|tain ca&s;es, of arre&s;ting the proceedings of the in|ferior courts, on their &s;ignifying to them a prohi|bition, he &s;ugge&s;ted to the &s;ecretary to adopt this &s;ure and prompt method to put an end to this vexatious procedure. Both the&s;e reque&s;ts were refu&s;ed. The captain of Le Ca&s;&s;ius then ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;upreme tribunal, reque&s;ted the prohibition and obtained it.

<P>But at the very in&s;tant in which the <HI>mar&s;hal</HI> was de&s;ired to execute the order of the &s;upreme court, he had already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a new order from another tribunal (the circuit court) enjoining him to arre&s;t the ve&s;&s;el <HI>anew</HI>, upon the charge of an Engli&s;h merchant and naturalized American, &s;tating, that this ve&s;&s;el had been formerly armed in the United States; and con&s;equently reque&s;ted

The under&s;igned being uninformed whether this ve&s;&s;el had ever been armed in the ports of the United States, he was al&s;o a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome in|dividuals had only attempted to put on board arms and ammunition, and which they were pre|vented from doing at the time; but he takes upon him to affirm, that &s;ince this ve&s;&s;el has become the property of the French Republic, General Laveaux armed and equipped her wholly at St. Domingo; and that at her arrival here, &s;he had not a cannon or pound of powder which had not been put on board her in the territory of France. This new order was &s;igned by one of the judges of the &s;upreme court (in quality of circuit judge) who having already ordered the prohibition in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, mu&s;t have known very well that this ve&s;&s;el was the property of the French Re|public; and who mu&s;t al&s;o have known that the circuit court was not competent to this proceed|ing; which the law and u&s;age have con&s;tantly at|tributed to the di&s;trict tribunals. But the di&s;trict court then &s;at but once a year at Philadelphia; its approaching yet di&s;tant &s;e&s;&s;ion was to be at York town, and the pro&s;ecutor had adopted this round-about mode, to take away every means from the French Republic of obtaining re&s;titution of her ve&s;&s;el, legally, before the expiration of near a year. In the interval, &s;he was to rot at the quays of Philadelphia. This has taken place. The under&s;igned, from a &s;pirit of conciliation, made an u&s;ele&s;s attempt with one of the judges of the circuit court to obtain the liberation of the ve&s;&s;el, on giving &s;ecurity; the reply was that the judge could do nothing of him&s;elf; that the court when a&s;&s;embled could alone determine.</P>

<P>This decree does not &s;imply contain the order for &s;eizing Engli&s;h property on board of neutral ve&s;&s;els, and of cour&s;e on board of American ve&s;&s;els; it orders that the ve&s;&s;els of the Republic &s;hall act towards neutrals in the &s;ame manner as neutrals &s;hall &s;uffer the Engli&s;h to treat them.</P>
<P>This decree con&s;equently implies, not only the &s;eizure of enemy's property on board of American ve&s;&s;els, again&s;t the principle <HI>free &s;hips make free goods</HI>, a principle the American govern|ment abandoned after having recogni&s;ed it by ac|ceding to the declaration of Ru&s;&s;ia in 1780,&mdash;not only the &s;eizure of articles cla&s;&s;ed as contraband in the treaty concluded between Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay, and declared innocent merchan|di&s;es by the treaty of 1778, but al&s;o repri&s;als for all vexations, contrary to the law of nations and to the treaties, which the Americans &s;hall endure on the part of the Engli&s;h, without an efficacious oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The &s;ecretary of &s;tate has been plea&s;ed to ob|&s;erve, that France and the United States, by a reciprocal treaty, had con&s;ecrated the principle, <HI>free &s;hips make free goods</HI>, and dimini&s;hed the li&s;t of articles &s;eizable as contraband.

It is evident, that in this ca&s;e the federal government &s;hould expect, and the French Republic would have a right to regard, its &s;ilence as a tacit con|&s;ent to that mea&s;ure and a real ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>The under&s;igned mini&s;ter plenipotentiary can no longer be &s;u&s;pected of having demanded of the government of the United States, explana|tions foreign to the relations which exi&s;t between that government, and the French Republic, of having had the intention to wound the federal go|vernment, in his letter of 7th Vendemaire in the fourth year, &s;ince after the pa&s;&s;age cited by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, is the following paragraph: <Q>&startq;But I am convinced it will not be &s;o. The American government is too much attached to the laws of an exact neutrality, it knows too well that the cau&s;e of free people is linked to that of France, to allow to be u&s;urped by the Engli&s;h a right injurious to the intere&s;t of the &endq;Republic."</Q></P>

of the United States.

<P>I now fulfil the duty impo&s;ed on me by the go|vernment, by calling to your recollection in writ|ing, the &s;teps which are to be taken by our agent with the dey of Algiers, for repre&s;&s;ing this new manoeuvre of the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration, which has put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to its proofs of malevo|lence towards free people. The di&s;patch of the mini&s;ter communicating this mea&s;ure to me, is dated the 5th January, and did not come to my hands till fifteen days ago; I do not yet know by what route; I could have wi&s;hed it had been le&s;s tardy in coming to me, that I might &s;ooner have fulfilled the agreeable ta&s;k of proving to you by facts, the prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip of which I have &s;o often &s;poken in the name of the Repub|lic of France.</P>
<P>The information which I &s;hall receive from Eu|rope in a little time, will doubtle&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s me of the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e negociations which were to have been opened in January la&s;t.

<P>The &s;ecretary of &s;tate replied to him on the 6th June, 1794, by a letter of which the following is an extract.</P>
<P>"Your other letter of the 4th of June, is a powerful demon&s;tration of the intere&s;t which the Republic of France takes in our welfare. I will frankly communicate to you our mea&s;ures and ex|pectations with regard to Algiers; but as you will &s;o &s;oon receive the detail of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which your government has pur&s;ued in our behalf, and after the ri&s;ing of congre&s;s &s;ome new arrange|ments will probably be adopted by the executive, it will be better perhaps to po&s;tpone our interview on this matter, until the intelligence, which you further expect, &s;hall arrive."</P>

<P><Q>&startq;After &s;o many u&s;ele&s;s attempts, Sir, you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the pain I experience in tracing this picture &s;o different from that which the French Republic gives whenever ju&s;tice towards you is in que&s;tion, even though her intere&s;ts are

compromitted. It was when a terrible war was ince&s;&s;antly devouring her, that &s;he rigorou&s;ly fulfilled her treaties with you; in this in&s;tance, &s;he demands but ju&s;tice, and cannot obtain it. On the conttary, &s;he &s;ees her enemies admitted to an intimacy with you, at the moment in which your commerce and your &s;overeignty are alike in&s;ulted by them; at the moment when adding deri&s;ion to inju&s;tice they de&s;poil you anew upon the &s;eas, when they promi&s;e to in|demnify you for former acts. This reflection, Sir, becomes more grievous when we &s;ee po&s;ted up under your eyes the official legalization of a proclamation, which prohibits your commerce with our colonies, and &s;u&s;pends to you alone the law of nations. I know, Sir, what re&s;pect impo&s;es on me as to what immediately intere&s;ts your affairs and your relations as a people. But I cannot entirely pa&s;s in &s;ilence tran&s;ac|tions to which the Republic is no &s;tranger, be|cau&s;e they are directed again&s;t her; and that to &s;ub&s;cribe by an exce&s;s of courte&s;y to &s;uch or|ders, were to quit the neutral po&s;ition which the Americans profe&s;s. Examine I pray you, Sir, whether this neutrality can be &s;aid to ex|i&s;t, when on the one hand you can no longer maintain your treaties, and on the other, you are obliged to abandon your relations exclu|&s;ively to the di&s;cretion of England, who doubt|le&s;s will &s;oon declare all the univer&s;e blockad|ed, except her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. What account do you conceive I can render to the French go|vernment, of the means you take for rendering your neutrality re&s;pectable? Yet on that my in|&s;tructions in&s;i&s;t, and it is on that more e&s;peci|ally &endq;that France is unea&s;y."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">The &s;ecretary of &s;tate replied on the 29th May, 1795, to this pa&s;&s;age of citizen Fauchet's letter in the following manner&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>"The predicament of a neutral nation is al|ways peculiar and delicate, and eminently &s;o, while it defends it&s;elf again&s;t charges of partial|ity from one of the warring powers, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;eem to palliate the mi&s;doings of ano|ther. But you are not to infer, from any ju&s;|tification of the executive, that the validity of the proclamation of blockade is a&s;&s;ented to. We did read on the 10th of April, 1795, a pub|lication from his Britannic maje&s;ty's con&s;ul general for the middle and &s;outhern &s;tates of America, giving public notice that he had re|ceived official communications, that the i&s;lands of Guadaloupe, Marigalante and De&s;irade were by proclamation i&s;&s;ued by his Britannic maje&s;|ty's general and vice-admiral, commanding in the We&s;t-Indies, declared to be in an actual &s;tate of blockade; and that neutral ve&s;&s;els were by that proclamation prohibited from attempt|ing to enter any of the ports or places of the &s;aid i&s;lands, with provi&s;ions or &s;upplies of any nature or kind what&s;oever, under the penalty of being "dealt with conformably to exi&s;ting treaties, and as warranted by the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nations." So highly valued has the We&s;t-Indian commerce always been, that this exclu&s;ion was often revolved in the mind of the executive. It was acknowledged, that neutrals are interdicted by the law of nations from a blockaded port. From &s;ome quarter or other blockade mu&s;t be notified; or el&s;e neutrals would be a con&s;tant, un&s;u&s;pecting prey; not being in a condition to collect this information for them|&s;elves.

The check which neu|trals have upon a wanton and fal&s;e parade of a &s;iege, is the &s;ame with the check upon any other groundle&s;s pretence. We might indeed have remon&s;trated; but with what colour may well be imagined, when this department was unpro|vided with any document upon which the re|&s;cinding of that edict could have been urged. If rumour were a fit guide, who can pronounce, on which &s;ide rumour preponderated, when &s;tripped of the exaggerations, which a ho&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions had gathered together? We had, it may be &s;aid, one effort remaining; which was to promulge to the citizens of the United States, that the proclamation was null and void <HI>as to them</HI>. If after this defiance of that act, any American ve&s;&s;el had ri&s;ked, and incurred confi&s;cation, the government would have been importuned for &s;omething more than the <HI>general protection</HI>, which is the birth-right of all our citizens.
